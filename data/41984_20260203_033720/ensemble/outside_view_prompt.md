You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 40.00% on 2026-02-14 for the Metaculus question "Will there be a bilateral ceasefire in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict before 2027?"?

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41138) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-14 04:51:44 is higher than 40.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 40.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-14 04:51:44, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

# Summary of Article: "Trilateral Ukraine peace talks delayed after US, Russia meet"

**Key Facts and Events:**

1. **Peace Talks Schedule**: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced on Sunday that the second round of US-Ukraine-Russia trilateral peace talks will take place on February 4-5 in Abu Dhabi (delayed from the originally planned Sunday start date). Neither the Kremlin nor the US has confirmed these dates.

2. **US-Russia Meeting**: One day before Zelenskyy's announcement, top Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev held a "constructive meeting with the US peacemaking delegation" in Florida. US attendees included:
   - Steve Witkoff (Trump's peace envoy)
   - Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent
   - Jared Kushner (Trump's son-in-law)
   - Josh Gruenbaum (White House Senior Advisor)

3. **First Round Results**: The first round of three-way negotiations took place in late January but led to no breakthrough on the key territorial issue of Donbas. Russia demands Ukrainian forces leave Donbas, while Kyiv warns that ceding ground will embolden Moscow.

4. **Limited Ceasefire on Energy Infrastructure**: Russia had reportedly agreed to Trump's request to pause strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday this limited ceasefire would only last until Sunday to provide a "good basis" for peace talks.

5. **Continued Attacks Despite Ceasefire**: On Sunday (the day the limited ceasefire was set to end):
   - A Russian drone attack hit a company shuttle bus carrying mine workers in Dnipropetrovsk region, killing 15 people and wounding 7
   - Drone strikes hit power grids in Nikopol and Marhanets causing power outages
   - Strikes on railway infrastructure in Dnipro and Sumy regions
   - At least 9 people injured in attacks on a maternity hospital and residential building in Zaporizhzhia

Query: Retrieve daily community prediction values for Metaculus question 41138 from 2025-10-01 to 2026-02-03 and list key events correlated with moves ≥3 pp; include sources.
The user ultimately wants an output table, but the material surfaced so far still falls short of what is needed to generate it.  Below is a synthesis of everything now known, what remains unknown, and why further web searching will not close the gap.

1.  Availability of the raw “Community Prediction” history  
    •  The EA-Forum technical note on “Exploring Metaculus’s AI Track Record” (2023-05-01) spells out that a question’s full prediction history—including the community-aggregate series—can be downloaded through the Metaculus REST API by calling the /predictions/ endpoint with parameters `forecast_type=community` and `scope=history`.  
    •  The open-source Python wrapper in the Metaculus/forecasting-tools repository exposes exactly this call via `Question.get_prediction_history()`; authentication and pagination are handled for the user (GitHub, 2024) [GitHub].  
    •  Nothing in the public web index provides an already-exported CSV or JSON for question #41138.  Therefore the only viable path is to execute an authenticated API pull.

2.  Coverage of auxiliary comment data  
    •  The same EA-Forum post notes that comment streams are also accessible via a `/comments/` API.  
    •  A Rust wrapper’s documentation set confirms the endpoint and typical response schema (GitHub, “metaculus-rs/CommentsApi.md”) [GitHub].  
    •  Scraping these comments—filtered to the focal window 2025-10-01 → 2026-02-03—will be necessary to tie probability moves to user-cited news items and to corroborate any external catalysts.

3.  Plausible external news catalysts already identified  
    The latest search pass added no numeric data but did surface several events inside the required time span that historically move AI-governance questions on Metaculus:  
      – 22 Oct 2025: Future of Life Institute open letter urging a halt to “super-intelligent AI” R&D (TIME, 2025-10-22).  
      – 28 Oct 2025: OpenAI converts to a Public Benefit Corporation and sells a 27 % stake to Microsoft (Guardian / Fortune, 2025-10-28; Computerworld follow-up, 2025-12-05).  
      – 10 Dec 2025: Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists feature “Stopping the clock on catastrophic AI risk” (Bulletin, 2025-12-10).  
      – 14 Jan 2026: EMA & FDA joint release “10 Principles for Good AI Practice” (European Medicines Agency, 2026-01-14; Healthcare Dive same day).  
      – 29 Jan 2026: UK Government publishes under-delivery report on its 2024 AI White Paper (Lewis Silkin law blog, 2026-01-29).  
    These provide a preliminary watch-list of candidate catalysts for ≥ 3 percentage-point (pp) swings once the numerical series is in hand.

4.  New—but only tangential—documents  
    •  A NextBigFuture post on top Metaculus forecasters (Jan 2024) [NextBigFuture] and a LessWrong essay analysing resolved AI questions (Jul 2021) [LessWrong] confirm community interest but add no data for #41138.  
    •  Both merely reinforce the conclusion that one must query the API; neither contains the sought-after day-level percentages.

5.  Remaining information gaps  
    a.  The exact community-prediction percentages for every day from 1 Oct 2025 through 3 Feb 2026.  
    b.  A computed day-over-day change column in order to flag |Δ| ≥ 3 pp movements.  
    c.  For each flagged date, either:  
       • links and timestamps from the Metaculus comment stream showing forecasters reacting to news, or  
       • external news stories published the same day, with citations.  
    d.  A quick verification that API pagination (default `limit=5000`) is sufficient to fetch the entire history without truncation for an older question like #41138.

6.  Why further web search is not the bottleneck  
    Metaculus does not expose its raw prediction history to search-engine crawlers.  All credible coding guides (EA-Forum note; Metaculus/forecasting-tools; metaculus-rs) agree that authentication is required.  Additional Googling for “csv” or “chart” variants keeps returning blog posts and wrappers but never the data itself.  Until an authenticated request is issued, no public-web query will materialise the missing CSV.

7.  Concrete next step  
    Run (with a logged-in Metaculus account):  
    https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/41138/predictions/?forecast_type=community&scope=history&limit=5000  
    Parse the JSON, convert UNIX timestamps to calendar dates, aggregate to one record per date (e.g., last prediction of each UTC day), compute deltas, then join to comment and news data to produce the final deliverable.

Conclusion  
All tooling and documentation needed to harvest the data are confirmed in the search corpus, but the numerical series and catalyst matches themselves are still absent.  Therefore additional information—in the form of an authenticated API pull plus a lightweight comment scrape—is still required before the original user request can be fulfilled.

Verification checklist  
1. Analysis correctly formatted.  
2. No “</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
