    "description": "Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41138\n- Original question title: Will there be a bilateral ceasefire in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict before 2027?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-01: 40.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> This question will resolve as Yes if a bilateral ceasefire in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict has gone into effect during 2026. The ceasefire must either\n> \n> * last a minimum of 30 consecutive days entirely during 2026\n> \n> or\n> \n> * be intended to last a minimum of 30 days (or indefinitely), as specified by the agreement text or joint statement, even if it is immediately violated.\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> A ceasefire will qualify if it is mutually agreed by Russia and Ukraine and applies to all kinetic fighting against the other by both sides.\n> \n> A ceasefire will have considered to have lasted if both Russia and Ukraine agree that it has remained in effect and full scale fighting has not occurred. Minor ceasefire violations, while both sides agree to continue the ceasefire, will not impact this question.\n\nOriginal background: \n> Following the [full-scale outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_war_\\(2022%E2%80%93present\\)) of fighting between Russia and Ukraine, ceasefire proposals have repeatedly been sought by numerous groups.\n> \n> Following Donald Trump's return to the White House, many speculated about the possibility of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. However, although Trump has [repeatedly engaged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_negotiations_in_the_Russo-Ukrainian_war_\\(2022%E2%80%93present\\)#2025_developments) in negotiations, and numerous plans have been proposed, a mutually agreeable ceasefire has yet to be found.\n> \n> On November 19, 2025, the U.S presented it's most recent proposal, with a [28 point plan](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-proposed-28-point-russia-ukraine-peace-plan/), including a barring of Ukraine from NATO, recognition of Russia's gained territory, and a U.S security guarantee for Ukraine.&#x20;\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41138,\"question_id\":40839,\"last_cp\":0.4}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41138) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-14 04:51:44 is higher than 40.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 40.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-14 04:51:44, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.",
