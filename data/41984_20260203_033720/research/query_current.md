Analysis:
The Metaculus community forecast sits exactly at 40 % today.  In the next eleven days the crowd will mostly react to:  
• Any credible announcement of new high-level peace or cease-fire talks (e.g., Kremlin–Kyiv direct contact, U.S.-brokered proposal, UN or Turkish mediation).  
• Concrete diplomatic events already on the calendar before 14 Feb 2026, such as the Munich Security Conference (13-15 Feb) where officials could float a framework.  
• Battlefield momentum reports (Kharkiv salient, Zaporizhzhia front) that change perceived incentives to pause fighting.  
• Domestic-political signals in Moscow (e.g., Duma session on war powers) or Kyiv (Rada debate on territorial concessions) that hint at a possible deal.  
• Market-moving commentary by Trump administration officials, NATO, or Beijing about linkage of sanctions relief and territorial status.

Therefore the most relevant articles will cover:  
1. Fresh diplomatic initiatives or scheduled meetings during 3-14 Feb 2026.  
2. Statements by Russian or Ukrainian leaders indicating willingness (or unwillingness) to accept a temporary cessation of hostilities.  
3. Analyses of domestic constraints on cease-fire acceptance in either country.  
4. Updates on U.S. or EU shuttle diplomacy or draft terms already leaked.  
5. Commentary from forecasting or policy circles that could directly move Metaculus users.
