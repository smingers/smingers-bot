Question background:

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41138
- Original question title: Will there be a bilateral ceasefire in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict before 2027?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-01: 40.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as Yes if a bilateral ceasefire in the Russo-Ukrainian conflict has gone into effect during 2026. The ceasefire must either
> 
> * last a minimum of 30 consecutive days entirely during 2026
> 
> or
> 
> * be intended to last a minimum of 30 days (or indefinitely), as specified by the agreement text or joint statement, even if it is immediately violated.

Original fine print: 
> A ceasefire will qualify if it is mutually agreed by Russia and Ukraine and applies to all kinetic fighting against the other by both sides.
> 
> A ceasefire will have considered to have lasted if both Russia and Ukraine agree that it has remained in effect and full scale fighting has not occurred. Minor ceasefire violations, while both sides agree to continue the ceasefire, will not impact this question.

Original background: 
> Following the [full-scale outbreak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_war_\(2022%E2%80%93present\)) of fighting between Russia and Ukraine, ceasefire proposals have repeatedly been sought by numerous groups.
> 
> Following Donald Trump's return to the White House, many speculated about the possibility of a ceasefire between Russia and Ukraine. However, although Trump has [repeatedly engaged](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peace_negotiations_in_the_Russo-Ukrainian_war_\(2022%E2%80%93present\)#2025_developments) in negotiations, and numerous plans have been proposed, a mutually agreeable ceasefire has yet to be found.
> 
> On November 19, 2025, the U.S presented it's most recent proposal, with a [28 point plan](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-administration-proposed-28-point-russia-ukraine-peace-plan/), including a barring of Ukraine from NATO, recognition of Russia's gained territory, and a U.S security guarantee for Ukraine.&#x20;

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41138) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-14 04:51:44 is higher than 40.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 40.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-14 04:51:44, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For AskNews:
Your query for AskNews will be processed more naturally, so feel free to write a sentence-long query in natural language. Avoid using ambiguous acronyms. Specify relevant criteria (e.g., geography, industry, time period) to ensure the correct scope. If desired, you can indicate multiple kinds of news articles you're looking for in your query. Keep your query to a maximum of two sentences. Important note: Do not prefix your query with 'AskNews:' or something similar. Please add the word 'AskNews' enclosed in brackets at the end of the query, referring closely to the example below.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () (NOT curly brackets, NOT square brackets [], you need to use normal brackets ()) **on the same line as and after** the query, applicable for Google, Google News and AskNews. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for AskNews.

Use the following verification checklist:
1. One query for google?
