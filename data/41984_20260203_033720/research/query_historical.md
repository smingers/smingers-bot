Analysis:
To gauge whether the Metaculus community prediction is likely to climb above 40 % by 14 Feb 2026 I need two strands of historical context:  
1. The prediction’s own track record — how the community percentage has moved over the last few months and what kinds of events have driven large swings.  
2. The current diplomatic and military situation — any fresh negotiation initiatives, battlefield shocks, or political developments (especially U.S.-mediated talks) in early 2026 that might plausibly push forecasters toward a higher cease-fire probability.  
Therefore I will look for (a) archived Metaculus snapshots/comments on the question and (b) very recent reporting on Russo-Ukrainian cease-fire negotiations.
