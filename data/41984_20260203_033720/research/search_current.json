Another 31% considered it 'difficult but acceptable,' and 9% found it 'easily acceptable.' Currently, Russia controls the entire Luhansk region and most of Donetsk. The survey, conducted from January 23 to 29, 2026, also revealed that only 20% of respondents believe the war will end by the first half of 2026, 18% expect it to end in the second half, and 43% anticipate the conflict lasting beyond 2027. Despite increased Russian attacks on Ukraine\u2019s energy infrastructure, which worsened civilian conditions, public support for continued resistance remains strong, with 65% still willing to endure the war. Among those unable to tolerate the war, 29% cited concerns over casualties and the safety of loved ones, 17% cited property damage, and 17% cited economic impacts such as unemployment and inflation. KIIS Executive Director Anton Hrushetskyi stated that Ukrainian society has maintained resilience and relative optimism, noting Ukraine\u2019s proven ability to resist Russia\u2019s military despite limited U.S. support. The Donbas territorial issue remains the last unresolved point between Ukraine and the U.S., with Russian President Vladimir Putin insisting on Ukraine\u2019s complete surrender of the region or using force to seize it. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy stated that the Donbas issue is the final outstanding matter in U.S.-Ukraine talks. Earlier, Zelenskyy signed a declaration with UK and French leaders expressing intent to deploy troops post-ceasefire under a U.S.-led monitoring and verification mechanism for security and military assurance.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 11:49 PM\nSource:[Central News Agency](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/202602030009.aspx)\n\n**Cesar Optimistic About Ceasefire by Year-End: 'Then He Will Go and Run...'**\nRussian volunteer 'Cesar' (Maximilian Andronnikov) stated in a YouTube interview with Dmitry Gordon that a ceasefire could be reached by the end of 2024, due to the exhaustion of both armies. He believes the war can only end with the overthrow of the current Russian leadership in Moscow, a goal pursued by fighters in the 'Legion' unit. Cesar predicted the ceasefire would likely occur by the end of 2026, citing the deteriorating state of both sides. He described the Russian leadership's mindset as trapped in a repetitive cycle, likening it to a 'groundhog day' where General Gerasimov reports daily that Ukraine is about to collapse, but the breakthrough never comes. According to Cesar, Putin is waiting for a final decisive blow, but the failure of such efforts will eventually lead to the realization that continuing the war threatens Russia's own survival. He emphasized that the war, which began openly in 2022, is already returning to Russia through the 'heroes of SOF' and that the fight for him and his comrades is far from over.

Ukraine and Russia agreed to halt attacks on each other\u2019s energy infrastructure but differ on the truce\u2019s timeline: Ukraine claims it began January 30 and lasted one week, while the Kremlin says US President Donald Trump personally requested Russian President Vladimir Putin to refrain from striking Kyiv until February 1. Zelenskyy emphasized that de-escalation measures are building public trust in the upcoming trilateral peace talks in Abu Dhabi with Russian and US officials, stating, 'Ukraine is ready for real steps. We believe it is realistic to achieve a dignified and lasting peace.' Despite the ceasefire, energy recovery remains critical\u2014DTEK CEO Maxim Timchenko warned that the energy ceasefire is 'extremely important' to avoid tragic consequences due to power shortages. DTEK reported a second attack on a coal mine in the Dnipropetrovsk region within 24 hours, following a prior strike on Sunday that killed 12 miners. Zelenskyy also noted that Russian forces are increasingly targeting transport logistics, particularly railway infrastructure, with a strike in the Donetsk region killing a father and son and injuring two children and their mother.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 07:10 PM\nSource:[Khaleej times](https://www.khaleejtimes.com/world/zelenskyy-russia-largely-observing-energy-ceasefire-ahead-peace-talks)\n\n**'War Must Be Ended,' Zelenskyy Sets Negotiation Goals Ahead of Talks with Russia**\nUkrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy held a meeting in Kyiv with members of Ukraine's negotiation team ahead of a new round of talks aimed at ending the war. The meeting, held on February 2, 2026, included key figures such as Rustem Umerov, Kirill Budanov, Serhiy Kyslytsya, Andriy Gnatov, and Oleksandr Bevza, with David Arakhamia also joining the negotiations. Zelenskyy outlined the framework for dialogue and set specific tasks for the team. The talks will include a trilateral format involving Ukraine, the United States, and Russia, with planned meetings scheduled for Wednesday and Thursday. Additionally, separate bilateral meetings between Ukraine and the U.S. are expected. Zelenskyy emphasized Ukraine's commitment to concrete steps toward peace, stating that a dignified and long-term agreement is possible. He noted that a draft bilateral security agreement with the U.S. is already prepared, and Ukraine anticipates further work on agreements related to reconstruction and economic development. Zelenskyy also highlighted the positive impact of de-escalation measures, specifically the 'energy ceasefire' that began at the end of the previous week, which has helped build trust in the negotiation process. 'War must be ended,' he stated, thanking international partners for their support.

Zelenskiy confirmed that the Ukrainian delegation would hold bilateral meetings with U.S. officials during the two-day session, noting that the bilateral security guarantees document with the United States is complete, with further work expected on recovery and economic development agreements. U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s special envoy, Steve Witkoff, is traveling to Abu Dhabi for the talks. The Kremlin confirmed the meeting\u2019s rescheduling from Sunday to Wednesday and Thursday, citing coordination needs among the three delegations. Zelenskiy reported that Russia had not conducted targeted missile or drone strikes on Ukrainian energy infrastructure in the past 24 hours, though frontline areas remain under fire. He emphasized that while the energy system is operating stably, challenges persist due to extreme cold and prior damage. The energy truce, initially agreed upon at Trump\u2019s request and set to last from January 30 to February 6, has been disputed: Russia claims it began on January 31, while Ukraine insists it started on January 30. Despite the truce, a Russian drone strike on Sunday killed 12 miners in the Dnipropetrovsk region, underscoring the fragility of the ceasefire.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 05:31 PM\nSource:[Perth Now](https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/conflict/zelenskiy-says-lasting-peace-realistic-ahead-of-talks-c-21508600)\n\n**\ud83c\udf0d Ukraine Update\u200a -- \u200aFebruary 2, 2026: War, Talks, and Humanity in the Crossfire**\nAs Ukraine enters its fourth year of war with Russia, frontline violence persists despite diplomatic efforts. On February 2, 2026, a Russian drone strike in Dnipro killed at least 12 miners, including energy workers returning from shifts, and wounded civilians, including women and children, while targeting energy infrastructure. Attacks continued even during a temporary ceasefire on energy grid strikes, highlighting the fragility of current accords. Severe winter conditions, with temperatures below -15 \u00b0C, strain power grids and hinder repairs, worsening civilian hardship. Diplomatically, trilateral peace talks involving Ukraine, Russia, and the United States are scheduled for February 4\u20135 in Abu Dhabi, signaling renewed negotiation efforts. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy affirmed Kyiv's readiness for substantive talks aimed at a just end to the war. However, unresolved issues\u2014particularly territorial control and security guarantees\u2014remain major obstacles. European officials and NATO diplomats warn of potential security risks from a ceasefire, including destabilizing tactics by discharged combatants. The conflict continues to reshape regional security, global alliances, and international law. Millions of Ukrainians face daily threats to life and livelihood, and peace remains a critical lifeline amid enduring destruction and resilience.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 10:40 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@muhammadalig331106/ukraine-update-february-2-2026-war-talks-and-humanity-in-the-crossfire-df32b2a3111d)\n\n**When Will the War End? Ukrainians Share Their Forecast**\nAccording to a recent survey by the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology (KMIS), only 20% of Ukrainians expect the war with Russia to end in the near future or by mid-2026. Meanwhile, 18% predict the conflict will end in the second half of 2026, and 43% believe it will last until 2027 or beyond. Additionally, 19% of respondents could not provide a specific timeframe. This marks a decline from September\u2013October 2025, when 33% expected a conclusion by mid-2026, and 26% in December 2025. The survey also reflects public attitudes toward peace negotiations, expectations of their effectiveness, and self-assessment of societal resilience amid harsh weather conditions and significant damage to the country\u2019s energy infrastructure. The Wall Street Journal recently modeled three scenarios for the war in 2026: (1) a war of attrition continuing with both sides seeking to outlast each other; (2) Ukraine\u2019s exhaustion under sustained pressure due to economic, military, and social costs; and (3) Russian fatigue from prolonged militarization, potentially weakening its war effort.

The Words of Zhirinovsky Sound Like Prophecy**\nVladimir Zhirinovsky's predictions about future international conflicts have resurfaced in public attention, particularly regarding the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Long before the start of the Special Military Operation (SVO), Zhirinovsky repeatedly stated that a large-scale war in Ukraine was inevitable and would mark a turning point in global politics. He forecasted that the conflict would proceed through several tense phases and conclude by 2026, framing it not as a regional issue but as a pivotal element in a broader global confrontation involving Russia, European nations, and the United States. He believed the Ukrainian crisis would test the resilience of Western alliances and lead to fundamental changes in the existing world order, including the gradual weakening of old political and economic structures and the emergence of a new international configuration. According to Zhirinovsky, the end of the conflict would serve as a starting point for a major realignment of global influence and a reevaluation of borders and alliance commitments in the post-Soviet space. Several of his past predictions have reportedly come true: the election of Barack Obama as the first Black U.S. president in 2009; the 2014 Ukrainian revolution (Euromaidan), which led to Viktor Yanukovych's flight; the annexation of Crimea in 2014; a 2022 prediction of Russia's return to greatness, with the SVO beginning on February 24, 2022 (though he was off by two days); the 2023 Israel-Hamas war and U.S. strikes on Iranian nuclear sites; a 2016 warning about a potential assassination of Donald Trump, which occurred in July 2024; and the 2021 warning about unrest in Kazakhstan, which erupted in January 2022. However, some of his predictions did not materialize: he died on April 6, 2022, at age 75, before reaching 80 or running for president for the eighth time, and he also failed to predict the collapse of the United States or the absence of U.S. elections in 2024.

This would be the second publicly acknowledged session of direct talks, aiming to move beyond prisoner exchanges and body returns\u2014now suspended\u2014toward a lasting cessation of hostilities. According to the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a U.S.-based centrist think tank, the war is projected to reach two million military casualties (dead, wounded, and missing) by spring 2026. Russia, having suffered 1.2 million military casualties, is described as the belligerant experiencing more losses than any other since World War II. The CSIS notes that Russia has gained only about 1.5% of Ukrainian territory since the invasion, while paying an 'extraordinary price' that has led to a decline in its global power ranking. Russian forces advance, on average, only 15 to 70 meters per day\u2014slower than any military in any war in the past century. In contrast, the Soviet Red Army took 1,394 days to reach Berlin during Operation Barbarossa. As of 2025, Russian forces have not advanced beyond Pokrovsk, 500 km from Kyiv. The CSIS also criticizes the Kremlin\u2019s communication, accusing it of spreading false information and noting a decline in public support for the 'special military operation.' On the human front, the report highlights a growing crisis in Russia, where tens of thousands of traumatized and violent soldiers are returning, contributing to a sharp rise in violent crimes and murders. Meanwhile, in Ukraine, civilian casualties have worsened: the UN\u2019s Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine (HRMMU) reported 2,514 civilian deaths and over 12,000 injuries in 2025\u2014up 31% from 2024 and 70% from 2023. The HRMMU also warns of increasing use of long-range weapons, endangering civilians far from the front lines. Verified data shows approximately 16,000 Ukrainian civilians killed and nearly 40,000 injured, though the actual toll is likely much higher. Both sides regularly downplay their losses. Despite the Kremlin\u2019s warning that meaningful results are unlikely after the initial talks, the resumption of negotiations offers a fragile hope for progress.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 07:00 AM\nSource:[Le Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/international/article/guerre-en-ukraine-avant-la-reprise-des-pourparlers-de-paix-ce-que-l-on-sait-du-bilan-qui-ne-cesse-de-s-alourdir_259819.html)\n\n**2026 Will Be a Year of Gradual War Diminishment, Not Resolution, Says Portnikov**\nUkrainian journalist and publicist Vitaliy Portnikov stated that 2026 will mark a phase of gradual 'diminishing' of the war rather than its full conclusion, with no comprehensive peace agreement expected by year's end. He noted that the current global chaos makes creating a realistic political calendar extremely difficult. Portnikov expressed confidence that Russia will not achieve a strategic breakthrough, as the United States, despite Donald Trump\u2019s personal sympathies toward Russian President Vladimir Putin, will remain under pressure to maintain sanctions on Moscow. European countries, despite war fatigue, will continue seeking new resources to support Ukraine. Ukraine, though sincerely desiring to exit the conflict, will remain forced to fight for survival under extremely difficult conditions. Portnikov also predicted that both declarative diplomatic initiatives and behind-the-scenes contacts will continue, with increasing pressure to pause and reduce combat intensity without formal agreements. He emphasized that ceasefire measures, even locally, will arise more from practical necessity than formal deals. If this gradual de-escalation continues into 2027, conditions may eventually emerge for a full peace agreement\u2014potentially before Trump\u2019s presidential term ends or during the presidency of a new U.S. leader in 2029. This forecast follows earlier reports, including from The Times, suggesting that the 1,418th day of the war\u2014mirroring the duration of the German-Soviet conflict\u2014could be a turning point for Putin.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 03, 2026 12:22 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https://tsn.ua/ru/politika/2026-god-stanet-godom-ne-stolko-zaversheniya-skolko-postepennogo-zatuhaniya-voyny-portnikov-2991872.html)\n\n**Will the War Last Until 2026? Commander of 'Achilles' Battalion Makes Forecast**\nCommander of the 429th Separate Drone Battalion 'Achilles', Yuriy Fedorenko, predicts that the war with Russia will likely continue through 2026 and possibly into early 2027, stating that 'we cannot currently speak of the war ending in the short term.' He attributes this prolonged conflict to Russia's sustained offensive actions in key regions including Zaporizhzhia, Donetsk, and Kharkiv Oblasts, despite significant losses. Although Russia has failed to capture Kupiansk, Vovchansk, and Pokrovsk\u2014cities where Ukrainian forces have demonstrated exceptional resilience\u2014Ukrainian forces have maintained control. Fedorenko emphasizes that while Russia achieves minor tactical gains due to its numerical superiority in personnel, equipment, and firepower, Ukraine can alter the course of the war if its international partners fully recognize the threat posed by Russia and cease economic ties with it. He stresses that support must go beyond sanctions and include concrete, actionable tools with strict oversight. Fedorenko also notes that if Russia loses its ability to conduct large-scale offensives, it could create a 'seed' for negotiations. The article also references Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy\u2019s willingness to put a peace plan to a national referendum if Russia agrees to a ceasefire of at least 60 days, while noting that U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s peace proposal still includes territorial concessions from Ukraine, which Zelenskyy insists must be approved by the Ukrainian people before any agreement.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: December 28, 2025 04:58 PM\nSource:[\u0413\u041b\u0410\u0412\u041a\u041e\u041c](https://glavcom.ua/country/incidents/chi-trivatime-vijna-u-2026-rotsi-komandir-polku-akhilles-zrobiv-prohnoz-1095294.html)\n\n**Podolyak Outlines Unexpected Conflict Timeline, Predicts 2026 End with Strategic Shift**\nMilitary analyst Yuriy Podolyak stated in a video interview with Metametrica that the Ukrainian conflict could continue into 2027, but he also expressed strong confidence that it could end by 2026 if Ukraine effectively uses its capabilities. According to Podolyak, 'I don't think, if nothing fundamentally changes, that the war can last beyond 2027\u2014simply because the opponent will run out of resources.' He emphasized that Russia could achieve an earlier end in 2026 only if Ukraine correctly leverages its opportunities, noting that 'we have all the chances to end in 2026, if we use our opportunities properly. If not, which is often how we\u2019ve used them so far, it will last longer.' Podolyak\u2019s key to victory in 2026 is a shift in strategy: not territorial conquest, but systematically weakening the Ukrainian military until its collapse. 'The task is... to inflict maximum possible losses on the opponent\u2019s potential. In essence, to bleed their army dry, which will eventually collapse,' he concluded. This assessment comes amid statements from Western leaders, including Finnish President Alexander Stubb, who said in an Associated Press interview, 'I\u2019m not very optimistic about achieving a ceasefire or starting peace talks, at least this year,' and expressed hope that some progress might be made by spring 2026.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 16, 2025 03:13 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/army/55612855-podolyaka-ozvuchil-neozhidannyy-prognoz-po-srokam-konflikta/)\n\n**Will Peace Come to Ukraine in the Next Two Years? AI Predicts Scenarios**\nArtificial intelligence (ChatGPT, GPT-5) analyzed the war in Ukraine and provided a forecast on its potential conclusion within the next two years. The AI identified four possible scenarios: (1) a prolonged conflict with a 'frozen' frontline, where active fighting decreases but no formal peace treaty is signed\u2014potentially leading to a de facto ceasefire within six months; (2) a diplomatic compromise, where Ukraine accepts certain concessions such as neutrality or territorial losses, with JPMorgan predicting such an agreement could occur by mid-2025; (3) a military victory by one side, though deemed less likely in the medium term due to high human and material costs; and (4) the collapse of one side due to internal crises\u2014economic, political, or social\u2014forcing withdrawal from the conflict. The AI does not expect a final, comprehensive peace within the next 1\u20132 years. Instead, it forecasts a de facto ceasefire or 'freezing' of the conflict, with limited large-scale offensives. Serious negotiations on long-term peace or security guarantees may begin later, depending on shifts in Western support or Russia\u2019s internal stability. In the most favorable scenario, if Ukraine receives significant military support and advances on the battlefield, a relatively stable resolution could emerge by mid-2026. The AI emphasizes that these predictions are based on open-source analysis, are not guaranteed, and should be verified through reliable sources before making consequential decisions.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 09:12 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https://tsn.ua/ru/exclusive/nastupit-li-mir-v-ukraine-v-blizhayshie-dva-goda-ii-dal-prognoz-2937650.html)\n\n**AI Predicts Scenarios for 2026\u20132027: Peace or Protracted War in Ukraine**\nAccording to a GPT-5-powered analysis by ChatGPT, as of October 15, 2025, it is unlikely that the full-scale war between Russia and Ukraine will end by 2026. However, there is a higher probability (25\u201340%) of a stable ceasefire or frozen conflict, or localized agreements, between 2026 and 2027\u2014though this would not equate to a true 'peace' involving territorial restoration and normalization. The conflict is increasingly characterized by prolonged warfare, with Russia intensifying drone attacks on Ukrainian infrastructure and Ukraine responding by expanding aerial and helicopter capabilities and developing low-cost interceptors and air defense systems. Four main scenarios for the conflict's development are outlined, with probabilities: (1) Continued high-intensity/ protracted war (35\u201350%); (2) Frozen conflict or local ceasefire with prolonged negotiations (25\u201340%); (3) Ukrainian military breakthrough or diplomatic victory (10\u201320%); (4) Russian victory or forced capitulation (5\u201320%). Factors that could accelerate peace include strong international political pressure, internal dissent in Russia, leadership change, or exhaustion of resources. Conversely, the war may be prolonged by Russian resolve, organizational reforms, consistent arms supply to both sides, and sustained Western support for Ukraine.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 09:30 AM\nSource:[unian](https://www.unian.ua/curiosities/koli-zakinchitsya-viyna-v-ukrajini-chi-varto-chekati-miru-u-2026-2027-roci-13164096.html)\n\n**Peace or Protracted War: AI Predicts the Future of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict in 2026\u20132027**\nArtificial intelligence model GPT-5, accessed via ChatGPT, analyzed the ongoing war between Russia and Ukraine and provided four potential scenarios for developments between 2026 and 2027. The AI concluded that a complete end to full-scale war by 2026 is unlikely, but a stable ceasefire or localized agreements between 2026 and 2027 is more probable, though not equivalent to a full 'peace' with territorial restoration. The four scenarios, with their respective probabilities, are: (1) Continued high-intensity or protracted war (35\u201350%), driven by sustained Russian military reserves, Western aid, and hybrid warfare; (2) Frozen conflict or localized truce with prolonged negotiations (25\u201340%), likely if international pressure or diplomatic initiatives emerge; (3) Ukrainian military breakthrough or diplomatic victory (10\u201320%), contingent on massive, sustained Western arms deliveries and strategic Russian missteps; and (4) Russian victory or forced capitulation (5\u201320%), possible only under extreme conditions like full Russian mobilization and collapse of Western support. Positive factors that could accelerate peace include strong international diplomacy, internal dissent in Russia, or exhaustion of resources. Negative factors delaying peace include Russia\u2019s resolve, use of reservists, stable arms flows, and continued Western political support for Ukraine. The analysis was published on October 16, 2025, by UNIAN.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 09:30 AM\nSource:[\u0423\u041d\u0406\u0410\u041d](https://www.unian.net/curiosities/kogda-zakonchitsya-voyna-v-ukraine-stoit-li-zhdat-mira-v-2026-2027-godu-13164099.html)\n\n**How AI Outperforms Humans in Forecasting the Future**\nEvery three months, participants in the Metaculus Cup use artificial intelligence to predict geopolitical events in hopes of winning a prize of about $5,000. The platform poses questions such as 'Will Thailand experience a military coup before September\u202f2025?' and 'Will Israel strike the Iranian army again before September\u202f2025?' Experts estimate probabilities rather than simple yes/no answers. For example, Metaculus users correctly predicted the Russian invasion of Ukraine two weeks in advance and assigned a 90\u202f% probability to the U.S. v. Wade case roughly two months before it occurred. When the competition began in June, participants expected AI to outperform humans by 40\u202f% on average, but the Mantic AI system achieved over 80\u202f% accuracy. Prediction experts update their forecasts based on policy changes, allowing them to anticipate how virtual political interventions might affect future outcomes. Broad geopolitical forecasting remains extremely difficult, often requiring days and tens of thousands of dollars for a single question. The Rand Corporation estimates that human experts would need months to produce initial forecasts for all questions and to update them regularly. AI excels in data-rich, well-structured domains like weather or quantitative finance, but for geopolitics it must handle many interrelated factors. Large language models use the same complex information as human forecasters and can simulate human judgment, improving over time by predicting many questions, observing performance, and updating methods on a larger scale than humans can. Machines also have an unfair advantage in the competition: participants earn points not only for accuracy but also for coverage, the number of questions answered, and the frequency of updates. Even less accurate AI can rank highly by continuously updating estimates in response to emerging news\u2014a feat impossible for humans. This unfair advantage helps AI overcome the remaining challenge of producing high\u2011quality predictions for all questions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 11:47 AM\nSource:[elnabaa.net](https://www.elnabaa.net/1136072/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%81%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A4-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84)\n\n**AI Is Learning to Predict the Future -- And Beating Humans at It**\nMetaculus runs a quarterly forecasting cup in which participants predict geopolitical events for a prize pot of about $5,000. The platform poses questions such as 'Will Thailand experience a military coup before September 2025?' and 'Will Israel strike the Iranian military again before September 2025?'. Forecasters estimate probabilities weeks to months in advance, often with remarkable accuracy. For instance, users correctly predicted the date of the Russian invasion of Ukraine two weeks in advance, and assigned a 90\u202fpercent chance to Roe v.\u202fWade being overturned almost two months before the decision.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 05:29 PM\nSource:[TIME](https://time.com/7318577/ai-model-forecasting-predict-future-metaculus/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
