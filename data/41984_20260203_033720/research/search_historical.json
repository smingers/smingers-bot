The summary reflects only what was provided in the extraction.\n\n## Key Facts and Statements:\n\n### FIFA and Russia Ban Controversy:\n- **FIFA President Gianni Infantino** stated he wants to examine lifting Russia's ban from world football\n- The ban was imposed by FIFA and UEFA at the start of Putin's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022\n- Infantino's rationale: \"This ban has not achieved anything, it has just created more frustration and hatred\"\n- Russia has been unable to play at a men's World Cup since hosting in 2018\n\n### Ukrainian Government Response:\n- **Ukrainian Sports Minister Matvii Bidnyi** called Infantino's words \"irresponsible - not to say infantile\"\n- Bidnyi stated: \"They detach football from the reality in which children are being killed\"\n- **Casualty figures cited**: Over 100 footballers are among more than 650 Ukrainian athletes and coaches killed by Russians\n- Ukraine's position: \"War is a crime, not politics. It is Russia that politicizes sport and uses it to justify aggression\"\n\n### Context:\n- The ban was originally imposed as European rivals refused to play or host Russia's matches\n- Ukraine has been \"fending off the full-scale war for four years\"\n- Infantino received the Order of Friendship medal from Putin in 2018\n\n**Note**: The article title references a Trump trade deal related to ending the Ukraine war, but this topic is not covered in the extracted content provided.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://kyivindependent.com/trumps-envoy-witkoff-to-reportedly-join-russia-ukraine-peace-talks-in-abu-dhabi/\">\n## Summary of Article\n\n**Source:** The Kyiv Independent  \n**Date:** February 02, 2026\n\n### Key Facts:\n\n1. **Upcoming Talks:** Ukraine and Russia are preparing for another round of peace negotiations scheduled for Feb. 4-5 in Abu Dhabi.\n\n2. **U.S. Participation:** Steve Witkoff, President Trump's special envoy for Russia and the Middle East, will reportedly join the talks in Abu Dhabi, according to an undisclosed White House official cited by the Jerusalem Post.\n\n3. **Previous Round:** These talks follow an earlier round held on Jan. 23-24.\n\n4. **Focus Areas:** The upcoming trilateral talks are expected to focus on:\n   - A potential energy ceasefire\n   - Control over Ukraine's Donbas region\n\n5. **Russian Demands:** Russia has long demanded that Ukraine cede the entirety of Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts, including unoccupied territory, as a precondition for any peace agreement.\n\n6. **De-escalation Measures:** President Zelensky referenced de-escalation measures that went into effect on the night of Jan. 29-30, when Russia pledged to reduce strikes against Ukraine.\n\n### Statements from Named Sources:\n\n**President Volodymyr Zelensky:**\n- \"We believe it is realistic to achieve a dignified and lasting peace\"\n- Noted that work on security guarantees is complete\n- \"We also anticipate that the American side will remain decisive in ensuring the necessary conditions for dialogue\"\n- \"The de-escalation measures that went into effect on the night of last Thursday to Friday (Jan. 29-30) are helping to build public trust in the negotiation process and its possible outcome\"\n\n### Additional Context:\n\n- The conflict is approaching its fourth anniversary\n- Zelensky met with Ukrainian negotiators on Feb. 2, including Kyrylo Budanov (head of Presidential Office) and Rustem Umerov (secretary of the National Security and Defense Council)\n- Ukrainian delegates will also hold bilateral meetings with U.S. officials to advance recovery and economic cooperation\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.dw.com/en/trilateral-ukraine-peace-talks-delayed-after-us-russia-meet/a-75752627\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Trilateral Ukraine peace talks delayed after US, Russia meet\"\n\n**Key Facts and Events:**\n\n1. **Peace Talks Schedule**: Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced on Sunday that the second round of US-Ukraine-Russia trilateral peace talks will take place on February 4-5 in Abu Dhabi (delayed from the originally planned Sunday start date). Neither the Kremlin nor the US has confirmed these dates.\n\n2. **US-Russia Meeting**: One day before Zelenskyy's announcement, top Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev held a \"constructive meeting with the US peacemaking delegation\" in Florida. US attendees included:\n   - Steve Witkoff (Trump's peace envoy)\n   - Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent\n   - Jared Kushner (Trump's son-in-law)\n   - Josh Gruenbaum (White House Senior Advisor)\n\n3. **First Round Results**: The first round of three-way negotiations took place in late January but led to no breakthrough on the key territorial issue of Donbas. Russia demands Ukrainian forces leave Donbas, while Kyiv warns that ceding ground will embolden Moscow.\n\n4. **Limited Ceasefire on Energy Infrastructure**: Russia had reportedly agreed to Trump's request to pause strikes on Ukraine's energy infrastructure. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said on Friday this limited ceasefire would only last until Sunday to provide a \"good basis\" for peace talks.\n\n5. **Continued Attacks Despite Ceasefire**: On Sunday (the day the limited ceasefire was set to end):\n   - A Russian drone attack hit a company shuttle bus carrying mine workers in Dnipropetrovsk region, killing 15 people and wounding 7\n   - Drone strikes hit power grids in Nikopol and Marhanets causing power outages\n   - Strikes on railway infrastructure in Dnipro and Sumy regions\n   - At least 9 people injured in attacks on a maternity hospital and residential building in Zaporizhzhia\n\n**Quoted Statements:**\n\n- Zelenskyy (on X): \"We are interested in ensuring that the outcome brings us closer to a real and dignified end \u200cto the war\"\n- Witkoff: \"We are encouraged by this meeting that Russia is working toward securing peace in Ukraine\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve daily community prediction values for Metaculus question 41138 from 2025-10-01 to 2026-02-03 and list key events correlated with moves \u22653 pp; include sources.\nThe user ultimately wants an output table, but the material surfaced so far still falls short of what is needed to generate it.  Below is a synthesis of everything now known, what remains unknown, and why further web searching will not close the gap.\n\n1.  Availability of the raw \u201cCommunity Prediction\u201d history  \n    \u2022  The EA-Forum technical note on \u201cExploring Metaculus\u2019s AI Track Record\u201d (2023-05-01) spells out that a question\u2019s full prediction history\u2014including the community-aggregate series\u2014can be downloaded through the Metaculus REST API by calling the /predictions/ endpoint with parameters `forecast_type=community` and `scope=history`.  \n    \u2022  The open-source Python wrapper in the Metaculus/forecasting-tools repository exposes exactly this call via `Question.get_prediction_history()`; authentication and pagination are handled for the user (GitHub, 2024) [GitHub].  \n    \u2022  Nothing in the public web index provides an already-exported CSV or JSON for question #41138.  Therefore the only viable path is to execute an authenticated API pull.\n\n2.  Coverage of auxiliary comment data  \n    \u2022  The same EA-Forum post notes that comment streams are also accessible via a `/comments/` API.  \n    \u2022  A Rust wrapper\u2019s documentation set confirms the endpoint and typical response schema (GitHub, \u201cmetaculus-rs/CommentsApi.md\u201d) [GitHub].  \n    \u2022  Scraping these comments\u2014filtered to the focal window 2025-10-01 \u2192 2026-02-03\u2014will be necessary to tie probability moves to user-cited news items and to corroborate any external catalysts.\n\n3.  Plausible external news catalysts already identified  \n    The latest search pass added no numeric data but did surface several events inside the required time span that historically move AI-governance questions on Metaculus:  \n      \u2013 22 Oct 2025: Future of Life Institute open letter urging a halt to \u201csuper-intelligent AI\u201d R&D (TIME, 2025-10-22).  \n      \u2013 28 Oct 2025: OpenAI converts to a Public Benefit Corporation and sells a 27 % stake to Microsoft (Guardian / Fortune, 2025-10-28; Computerworld follow-up, 2025-12-05).  \n      \u2013 10 Dec 2025: Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists feature \u201cStopping the clock on catastrophic AI risk\u201d (Bulletin, 2025-12-10).  \n      \u2013 14 Jan 2026: EMA & FDA joint release \u201c10 Principles for Good AI Practice\u201d (European Medicines Agency, 2026-01-14; Healthcare Dive same day).  \n      \u2013 29 Jan 2026: UK Government publishes under-delivery report on its 2024 AI White Paper (Lewis Silkin law blog, 2026-01-29).  \n    These provide a preliminary watch-list of candidate catalysts for \u2265 3 percentage-point (pp) swings once the numerical series is in hand.\n\n4.  New\u2014but only tangential\u2014documents  \n    \u2022  A NextBigFuture post on top Metaculus forecasters (Jan 2024) [NextBigFuture] and a LessWrong essay analysing resolved AI questions (Jul 2021) [LessWrong] confirm community interest but add no data for #41138.  \n    \u2022  Both merely reinforce the conclusion that one must query the API; neither contains the sought-after day-level percentages.\n\n5.  Remaining information gaps  \n    a.  The exact community-prediction percentages for every day from 1 Oct 2025 through 3 Feb 2026.  \n    b.  A computed day-over-day change column in order to flag |\u0394| \u2265 3 pp movements.  \n    c.  For each flagged date, either:  \n       \u2022 links and timestamps from the Metaculus comment stream showing forecasters reacting to news, or  \n       \u2022 external news stories published the same day, with citations.  \n    d.  A quick verification that API pagination (default `limit=5000`) is sufficient to fetch the entire history without truncation for an older question like #41138.\n\n6.  Why further web search is not the bottleneck  \n    Metaculus does not expose its raw prediction history to search-engine crawlers.  All credible coding guides (EA-Forum note; Metaculus/forecasting-tools; metaculus-rs) agree that authentication is required.  Additional Googling for \u201ccsv\u201d or \u201cchart\u201d variants keeps returning blog posts and wrappers but never the data itself.  Until an authenticated request is issued, no public-web query will materialise the missing CSV.\n\n7.  Concrete next step  \n    Run (with a logged-in Metaculus account):  \n    https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/41138/predictions/?forecast_type=community&scope=history&limit=5000  \n    Parse the JSON, convert UNIX timestamps to calendar dates, aggregate to one record per date (e.g., last prediction of each UTC day), compute deltas, then join to comment and news data to produce the final deliverable.\n\nConclusion  \nAll tooling and documentation needed to harvest the data are confirmed in the search corpus, but the numerical series and catalyst matches themselves are still absent.  Therefore additional information\u2014in the form of an authenticated API pull plus a lightweight comment scrape\u2014is still required before the original user request can be fulfilled.\n\nVerification checklist  \n1. Analysis correctly formatted.  \n2. No \u201c</Agent_report>\n"
