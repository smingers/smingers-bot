## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**

1. **Earnings catalyst on Feb 5** (within window): Multiple independent sources confirm Q4 earnings release. Historical pattern: VRSN finished higher after 7 of last 12 earnings releases (58% success rate). However, Q3 2025 saw stock down >1% post-earnings despite beat. **Direction: Slightly positive (+2-3pp), but uncertain magnitude.**

2. **Current technical position**: Stock at $244.23 (Feb 2), trading below 50-day MA ($247.26) and 200-day MA ($260.87). This represents 21% decline from July 2025 peak of $310.60. **Direction: Mean reversion potential suggests upside, but momentum is negative.**

3. **Analyst consensus**: Average target $282-311 across multiple sources, implying 15-27% upside. However, ratings mixed (2 Buy, 1-2 Hold, 1 Strong Sell). **Direction: Positive for longer-term, but 6-day window too short for this to matter much.**

**Moderate Evidence:**

4. **Insider selling pattern**: CEO Bidzos sold 38,333 shares worth $9.4M over 3 months (through Jan 2026), continuing multi-month pattern. While often in 10b5-1 plans, this creates supply pressure. **Direction: Slightly negative (-1-2pp).**

5. **Institutional rotation**: Mixed signals - some funds increasing (Vanguard +0.7%, State Street +1.9%, AQR +32.9%), others decreasing (Mawer -25.4%, Bank of NY Mellon -3.7%). Net effect appears neutral. **Direction: Neutral.**

6. **Berkshire Hathaway overhang** (July 2025): Already 6+ months old, likely priced in. Remaining lockup not immediately relevant to 6-day window. **Direction: Neutral for this timeframe.**

**Weak Evidence:**

7. **Q4 earnings expectations**: Consensus $2.29 EPS vs $2.28 guidance midpoint. Very close - beat/miss uncertain. Q3 beat by 1.34% but stock fell. **Direction: Uncertain, possibly priced in.**

8. **Fundamental quality**: High margins (67%), steady growth (+5.7% YoY revenue), strong cash generation. But this is long-known and unlikely to drive 6-day moves. **Direction: Neutral for short window.**

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Current window: 6 trading days (Feb 3 → Feb 11, 2026)**

**Key considerations:**
- **One major catalyst**: Earnings on Feb 5 (day 2 of window)
- **Post-earnings drift**: Historically, if earnings beat, positive drift can continue 2-3 days. If miss, similar negative drift.
- **Weekend included**: Feb 8-9 are non-trading days, effectively making this a 4-day active trading window

**If timeframe halved (3 days, ending Feb 6):**
- Would capture immediate earnings reaction only
- Historical 58% success rate post-earnings would dominate
- Prediction would shift to ~58-60% (closer to earnings-driven outcome)

**If timeframe doubled (12 days, ending Feb 19):**
- Multiple additional days of normal trading drift
- Mean reversion to moving averages more likely
- Technical oversold condition could resolve
- Prediction would shift to ~60-62% (more time for mean reversion)

## (d) Justification

**Starting point: 57% outside view base rate**

**Adjustments:**

1. **Earnings catalyst (+2pp)**: Scheduled Feb 5 earnings with slight historical positive bias (58% vs 54% base rate), but Q3 2025 showed stock can fall on beats. Modest upward adjustment.

2. **Technical oversold condition (+2pp)**: Stock 21% below recent peak, below both key moving averages. Some mean reversion potential over 6 days, though momentum is negative.

3. **Insider selling pressure (-2pp)**: Continued CEO selling through January creates incremental supply, though may be automated. Small negative.

4. **Earnings uncertainty (-1pp)**: Very tight consensus vs guidance ($2.29 vs $2.28). Small miss could trigger downside. Recent Q3 showed negative reaction despite beat. Reduces confidence slightly.

5. **Short window limits drift (+1pp)**: Only 4 actual trading days after earnings. Limits both upside and downside scenarios. Slight pull toward 50%.

**Net adjustment: +2pp from 57% base rate = 59%**

**Calibration check:**
- 59% implies 1.44:1 odds in favor of higher close
- This suggests modest confidence that the combination of:
  * Scheduled earnings catalyst
  * Technical oversold bounce potential
  * Historical 6-day positive bias
  
...will outweigh:
  * Negative momentum
  * Insider selling
  * Earnings execution risk

The adjustment is appropriately modest given the high uncertainty around earnings reaction and short timeframe limiting drift.

## Probability Calibration

My outside view established a 57% base rate for VRSN closing higher over any 6-day period, with +2-3pp adjustment for scheduled earnings catalyst.

**Inside view adjustments:**

The most significant factor is the Feb 5 earnings release occurring on day 2 of our window. While analysts expect a beat ($2.29 vs $2.28 guidance), Q3 2025 demonstrated that beats don't guarantee positive price action (stock fell >1% despite 1.34% EPS beat). This introduces meaningful uncertainty.

The technical setup shows oversold conditions (21% below peak, below key MAs), suggesting mean reversion potential. However, momentum is clearly negative, and insider selling continues. These factors roughly offset.

The 6-day window is short enough that random noise could dominate, but long enough (4 trading days post-earnings) for some directional drift to establish if earnings surprise positively.

**Final calibration: 59%**

This represents a modest +2pp shift from the 57% outside view, reflecting:
- Slight positive earnings catalyst bias
- Technical oversold bounce potential
- Offset by execution risk and negative momentum

The probability remains close to the base rate because the short timeframe and earnings uncertainty prevent high confidence in either direction.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will VRSN close higher on Feb 11 than Feb 3? (6 trading days, includes Feb 5 earnings)

2. **Base rate**: 57% from VRSN historical 6-day returns (54%) + earnings week bias (+3pp)

3. **Consistency**: "59 out of 100 times, VRSN closes higher on day 6 than day 0 when earnings occur on day 2." Reasonable given historical patterns and catalyst uncertainty.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Feb 5 earnings with consensus $2.29 EPS (factual, high confidence)
   - Stock 21% below peak, oversold technically (factual, high confidence)
   - CEO sold $9.4M shares in past 3 months (factual, medium impact)
   - Q3 2025 fell despite EPS beat (factual, reduces earnings optimism)
   - Historical 58% post-earnings success rate (factual, modest signal)

5. **Blind spot**: Earnings significantly miss expectations ($2.20 or below) combined with weak guidance, triggering 5-10% single-day drop that overwhelms any subsequent bounce. This would make 59% look far too optimistic. Probability of this scenario: ~15-20%, which would shift true probability toward 50-52%.

6. **Status quo**: Current price $244 is relatively stable but trending down. Six days is short but not trivial. Market volatility is moderate. Status quo (slight downward drift) suggests being closer to 50-55%, but scheduled catalyst breaks pure status quo assumption.

**Probability: 59%**
