## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

   - Most suitable for this specific timeframe
   - Beta 0.75 suggests lower volatility than market
   - Recent 5-day change: +2.77%

2. **VRSN earnings-related price movements:**
   - Highly relevant given Feb 5 earnings fall within our window
   - Last 3 earnings: average absolute move ~5.7%, directionally positive 2 of 3 times
   - Q2-25 and Q1-25 both showed strong positive reactions (+6.5%, +9.3%)
   - Q3-25 showed modest decline (-1.3%)

3. **Low-beta infrastructure stocks over 8-day periods:**
   - Less specific but provides sector context
   - VRSN's beta of 0.75 suggests below-market volatility

**Selected Reference Class:** VRSN's earnings-related movements combined with general 8-day holding periods, weighted toward earnings impact given the Feb 5 release.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 8 calendar days (Feb 3 to Feb 11, 2026), spanning approximately 6 trading days

**Key Temporal Factors:**
- **Day 3 (Feb 5):** Q4 2025 earnings release after market close - this is the dominant event
- **Days 4-6 (Feb 6-10):** Post-earnings price discovery and analyst reactions
- **Current Position:** Stock at $244.23 (Feb 1 close), below 50-day MA ($247.26) and well below 200-day MA ($260.87)

**Historical Patterns:**
- Recent trajectory: Stock peaked at $310.60 in 2025, declined to current ~$244-251 range
- July 2025: Trading at $285
- September 2025: Up 37% YTD
- Current: Appears to have given back significant gains from mid-2025

**Earnings History Pattern:**
- 2 of last 3 earnings releases were strongly positive
- Q1-25 and Q2-25 both exceeded estimates and drove substantial rallies
- Q3-25 disappointed slightly despite beating estimates (revenue miss)

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Consideration:**
For any 8-day period, a stock with beta 0.75 in a relatively stable market would have roughly 50-50 odds of being up or down, absent specific catalysts.

**Critical Catalyst - Earnings Release:**
The February 5 earnings release fundamentally changes the probability distribution. Key factors:

1. **Positive Indicators:**
   - Historical pattern: 2 of last 3 earnings were strongly positive
   - Consensus EPS estimate: $2.36 (vs $2.28 in Q3)
   - Company has history of beating estimates
   - Recent 5-day momentum: +2.77%
   - Strong institutional support (92.9% ownership)
   - Current price ($244-251) below both moving averages, suggesting potential mean reversion opportunity

2. **Negative/Neutral Indicators:**
   - Stock has declined ~12-14% from July 2025 peak of $285
   - Mixed analyst sentiment (including one "strong sell")
   - Q3-25 resulted in decline despite beat
   - Slow earnings growth (0.1% YoY) vs historical 4.38% average
   - Current price below 50-day and 200-day MAs suggests bearish technical setup

3. **Magnitude Considerations:**
   - Average absolute earnings move: 5.7%
   - From $244.23 base, a 5.7% move would be ~$14, reaching either $258 or $230
   - Even the negative Q3 move was only -1.3%, which would still leave room for recovery by Feb 11

**Probabilistic Assessment:**
- If earnings are positive (historical 67% rate based on last 3): High probability of being up by Feb 11 (80-90%)
- If earnings are negative/neutral: Moderate probability still up due to 6 trading days for recovery (30-40%)
- Weighted probability: 0.67 × 0.85 + 0.33 × 0.35 ≈ 57% + 12% = 69%

However, this needs adjustment for:
- Current technical weakness (below MAs)
- Sector rotation concerns
- Declining momentum from 2025 highs

Outside view calibration:

The key anchor points from sources:
1. **Base rate for 8-day periods:** ~50% (no directional bias)
2. **Earnings-influenced periods:** Last 3 earnings showed 67% positive rate
3. **Recent momentum:** +2.77% over 5 days suggests near-term positive sentiment
4. **Technical position:** Below both MAs suggests caution

The earnings release on Feb 5 is the overwhelming factor. Given:
- 67% historical positive earnings reaction rate (2 of 3)
- Average positive move of ~8% when positive (Q1: +9.3%, Q2: +6.5%)
- Average negative move of only -1.3% when disappointing
- 6 trading days after earnings for price discovery and potential recovery

Even if earnings disappoint modestly (33% chance), the -1.3% historical move leaves room for recovery over the remaining days, especially given the stock is oversold relative to its moving averages.

The asymmetry favors upside: large gains when positive (8%+) vs small loss when negative (-1.3%), combined with recovery time.

Calibrating for:
- Uncertainty in earnings outcome
- Current technical weakness
- Slower recent growth trends
- Mixed analyst sentiment

I estimate the probability slightly above the pure earnings success rate, factoring in the asymmetric payoff structure and recovery window.
