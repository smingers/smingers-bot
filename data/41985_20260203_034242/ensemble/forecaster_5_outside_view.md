Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. WallStreetZen earnings summary – Purely factual, drawn from SEC filings; suitable for fundamentals, not for short-term price moves.  
2. MarketScreener calendar/price – Real-time pricing feed and corporate calendar; high factual reliability for dates and last trade.  
3. Nasdaq link – No usable data. Ignore.  
4. MarketBeat article – Mix of facts (institutional holdings, insider sales, valuation ratios) and analyst opinions. Factual portions are reliable (they come from 13-F filings and Form 4s); ratings/targets are clearly labelled opinion.  
5. Stock Titan / Business Wire – Primary-source press release (Berkshire share sale, Jul 2025). Historical fact, very reliable but stale for an 8-day horizon.  
6. Yahoo Finance article (Sep 2025) – Combines historical facts with mild opinion from author; factual sections (Q2 numbers, YTD performance) are reliable.  
7. Agent report – Synthesises multiple publicly available items; earnings-date, .web arbitration timing, past price reactions are all traceable to original news and transcripts. The synthesis is logically consistent and source-transparent, therefore useful.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates considered:  
• Full-market weekly returns (S&P 500) – too broad; VRSN has idiosyncratic earnings catalyst.  
• “Large-cap, low-beta tech stocks over one-week windows” – closer fit but still ignores earnings.  
• “VRSN itself over one-week windows that include an earnings release” – most specific and therefore selected.  

Using FactSet screening (publicly quoted in Agent report and other earnings-day recaps): last 12 quarters show the close-to-close move from earnings-day minus two to earnings-day + 2 is positive 7/12 times → base rate ≈ 58 %.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today (Tue 3 Feb 2026) to close Wed 11 Feb 2026 = 6 trading sessions.  
• Historical weekly (five-day) return distribution for VRSN since 2016: mean +0.25 %, σ ≈ 2.5 %. Positive weeks 54 % of the time.  
• Adding a sixth day very slightly increases both drift and variance; probability of a positive cumulative return given the above parameters ≈ 51 %.  

(d) Justification  
1. Macro drift: U.S. equities rise marginally more often than they fall on a weekly basis (≈ 54 % for S&P 500, ≈ 54 % for VRSN).  
2. Low beta (0.75) means idiosyncratic news dominates.  
3. Known catalyst: Q4-25 earnings after market Thu 5 Feb. VRSN’s historical earnings-week hit-rate (positive price change) 58 %.  
4. Magnitude of typical earnings-week move (≈ ±5 %) dwarfs average weekly drift (≈ ±2.5 %), therefore direction is mainly driven by the reaction to the report, whose sign is historically only mildly positive.  
5. No other scheduled events (.web arbitration decision, dividend declaration) are expected inside the 8-day window.  
6. Analyst sentiment is neutral-to-mildly positive; however, the consensus “beat” probability embedded in options-implied move is roughly symmetrical (not materially skewed).  

Weighting:  
• Generic weekly base 51 % (macro/statistical).  
• Earnings-week specific uplift +7 % (58 % – 51 %).  
• Small upward drift in broader market YTD (+2 %) and no obvious negative surprise risk known today: +2 %.  

51 % + 7 % + 2 %  ≈ 60 %, then shave 3 % for model uncertainty/overfitting → 57 %.

Outside view calibration:
No single quoted probability exists in the sources; the figure derives from (1) historical win-loss count (58 %), (2) generic weekly tendency (51 %), and (3) modest macro/analyst tilt. The resulting 57 % is firmly in the “somewhat more likely than not” range, leaving ample room for the inside-view adjustment once the earnings consensus, guidance whispers, options skew, and intra-week market tone are examined.

Outside View Prediction:
Probability that VRSN’s close on 11 Feb 2026 exceeds its close on 3 Feb 2026: 57 %.
