Analysis:
VeriSign’s share price over the coming week (3 – 11 Feb 2026) will likely be driven by:

• Q4-25 earnings – VeriSign typically reports during the first week of February. Any upside/​downside surprise in registrations, renewal rates or guidance for 2026 will move the stock sharply because trading volume is usually thin outside earnings windows.

• ICANN/.com contract developments – The market continues to watch for signs that the U.S. Commerce Department will approve the next scheduled wholesale price-cap increases for .com domains (7 % per year, 2026–2029). Headlines confirming or questioning approval would be market-moving.

• Macro backdrop – VeriSign trades as a defensive, high-margin “quality tech” name; if the broader S&P 500 remains bid on lower-for-longer rate expectations, VRSN can drift higher even on neutral company news.

Key news to look for:
1. The exact date and contents of VeriSign’s Q4-25 earnings release, management’s FY-26 domain-base guidance and any comment on price increases.
2. Regulatory or ICANN commentary on the .com registry agreement or pricing authority.
3. Analyst upgrades/​downgrades or options positioning ahead of earnings.
4. Unexpected macro shocks that might hit lower-beta tech stocks.

These items will help judge whether buyers will lift the stock above the 3 Feb close by 11 Feb.
