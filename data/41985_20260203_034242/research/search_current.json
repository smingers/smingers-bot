(VRNS) Shareholders Who Lost Money Urged To Contact Glancy Prongay Wolke & Rotter LLP About Securities Fraud Lawsuit**\nGlancy Prongay Wolke & Rotter LLP has issued a reminder for investors who purchased or acquired Varonis Systems, Inc. (NASDAQ: VRNS) common stock between February 4, 2025, and October 28, 2025, inclusive, to file a lead plaintiff motion by March 9, 2026, in a securities fraud class action lawsuit. The lawsuit alleges that during the Class Period, Defendants made materially false and misleading statements and failed to disclose material adverse facts about the company\u2019s business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, the complaint claims that Varonis was unable to sustain its ARR (Annual Recurring Revenue) growth trajectory without a high rate of quarterly conversions and that the company\u2019s positive statements were misleading. On October 28, 2025, Varonis reported third-quarter 2025 financial results showing revenue below consensus estimates, including a 63.9% year-over-year decline in term license subscription revenues. The company also reduced its full-year ARR guidance due to underperformance in its on-premises subscription business. In an earnings call, CEO Yakov Faitelson described the on-premises subscription business as a 'drag on total company ARR growth' and cited 'sales process issues' as a cause of lower renewal rates. Following this news, Varonis\u2019s stock price dropped $30.66, or 48.7%, to close at $32.34 per share on October 29, 2025. Investors who suffered losses during the Class Period may seek recovery under federal securities laws. The law firm advises interested parties to contact them for more information or to request lead plaintiff status by the March 9, 2026 deadline.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 05:38 PM\nSource:[GlobeNewswire Press Releases](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/02/02/3230525/34548/en/Deadline-Alert-Varonis-Systems-Inc-VRNS-Shareholders-Who-Lost-Money-Urged-To-Contact-Glancy-Prongay-Wolke-Rotter-LLP-About-Securities-Fraud-Lawsuit.html)\n\n**Deadline Alert: Varonis Systems, Inc.
