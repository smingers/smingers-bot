(VRSN)\"\n\n**Source:** Yahoo Finance  \n**Date:** September 26, 2025  \n**Author:** Ashar Jawad\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Hedge Fund Investment:** Renaissance Technologies Portfolio held over $943 million in VRSN as of June 30, 2025, making it one of their 10 biggest stock positions.\n\n2. **Q2 2025 Earnings Performance:**\n   - Net income: $2.21 per share (beat Wall Street estimates by $0.01)\n   - Revenue: $410 million (slightly below estimates but up 5.9% year-over-year)\n\n3. **Stock Performance:** VRSN was up 37% year-to-date as of September 24, 2025.\n\n4. **Analyst Price Target:** Wall Street analysts have a one-year average price target of $309 for VRSN, representing an 8.5% upside potential (from the price at time of article).\n\n## Key Context:\n\n- VeriSign is the sole registry operator for .com and .net domains, which together account for a majority of global domain registrations.\n- Q2 2025 performance was supported by stable demand for domain name registrations as businesses expand their digital footprints.\n- The stock's year-to-date gains were driven by strong financials and positive domain name industry trends.\n\n## Opinion (from article author/publisher):\nThe article acknowledges VRSN's investment potential but suggests that \"certain AI stocks offer greater upside potential and carry less downside risk.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Summarize upcoming events for VRSN before 11 Feb 2026, including earnings release schedule, regulatory decisions, and recent analyst revisions; provide historical price reaction to last three earnings reports.\nBelow is a consolidated report that brings together all verifiable information from the latest web-search results and earlier material.  It is organised around the four items the user requested and finishes with the residual gaps that would still merit follow-up work.\n\n1. Company-sponsored and industry events that fall before 11 Feb 2026  \n\n   a. Earnings-release timetable  \n      \u2022 Q4-25 results and conference call \u2013 Thursday, 5 Feb 2026, after market close (TradingView earnings calendar, 18 Jan 2026).  \n      \u2022 Q1-26 would normally be reported in late April 2026 and therefore lies outside the requested window; no other earnings dates have yet been posted.  \n\n   b. Dividend declarations and shareholder actions  \n      \u2022 The board initiated a quarterly cash dividend of US$0.77 per share in April 2025 and has paid it regularly each quarter since then (Motley Fool, 25 Apr 2025; VRSN Q3-25 call transcript, 23 Oct 2025).  Based on that cadence, the next declaration would be expected in late April 2026 and thus also falls outside the study period.  \n      \u2022 $1.33 billion remained on the authorised share-repurchase programme as of 30 Sep 2025 (Q3-25 call transcript).  Management has given no specific timetable, so buy-backs could continue at any point.  \n\n   c. Regulatory and legal milestones  \n      \u2022 .web arbitration \u2013 final hearing scheduled for November 2025.  VeriSign was granted party status; management told investors that a written decision normally follows \u201ca few weeks to a few months\u201d after the hearing, implying a potential ruling at any time between December 2025 and early 2026 (Motley Fool Q3-25 call transcript, 23 Oct 2025).  \n      \u2022 Core franchise agreements \u2013 six-year extensions of both the U.S. Department of Commerce Cooperative Agreement and the .com Registry Agreement with ICANN were executed in November 2024, securing .com pricing and stewardship to 2030 (Motley Fool, 5 Aug 2025).  No additional renewal actions are pending before February 2026.  \n      \u2022 No EU- or NIS-2-related compliance deadlines specific to VeriSign appear on the public docket in the period under review.  \n\n   d. Investor-relations events  \n      Aside from the 5 Feb 2026 earnings call, the company has not listed any analyst days, conferences, or ex-dividend dates that fall inside the 11 Feb 2026 cut-off (MarketScreener calendar viewed 3 Feb 2026).\n\n2. Regulatory backdrop that could generate news flow ahead of 11 Feb 2026  \n\n   \u2022 The only open regulatory file with binary headline risk is the .web independent review process.  If VeriSign prevails, it could obtain rights to operate the new gTLD, whereas an adverse ruling could continue to block the asset.  Either outcome would likely be material because management has repeatedly highlighted .web as the company\u2019s most significant expansion opportunity (Motley Fool call transcript, 23 Oct 2025).  \n   \u2022 All other agreements that determine .com and .net pricing, service obligations and oversight are locked in until at least 2029/30; therefore policy-related surprises outside .web are judged low-probability in the period.  \n\n3. Recent sell-side estimate and rating changes  \n\n   \u2022 Price-target revision:  on 25 Jul 2025 Baird raised its target to US$340 in response to the Q2 beat and a new share-repurchase authorisation (Observer-Reporter, 25 Jul 2025).  \n   \u2022 Consensus valuation snapshot:  as of 12 Jan 2026 the average analyst price target stood at US$309, with a range of US$250-US$340 (Simply Wall St/Yahoo Finance, 12 Jan 2026).  \n   \u2022 Earnings-per-share forecasts:  MarketScreener\u2019s table (captured earlier) showed FY-25 EPS expected at US$8.86, up 10.7 % from FY-24, and FY-26 EPS at US$9.53.  The \u201cspread\u201d column indicates that FY-25 and FY-26 estimates have edged up modestly since mid-2025.  \n   \u2022 Qualitative estimate changes:  articles dated 24 Oct 2025 (Yahoo Finance) and 25 Jul 2025 (Observer-Reporter) each cite analyst commentary that future EPS trajectories were trimmed slightly after Q3 and lifted after Q2 respectively, consistent with the small oscillations in the published consensus.  \n   Taken together, the observable data point to a mildly upward trend in forward EPS and at least one formal target increase, but a complete, date-stamped revision log remains unavailable in the open web domain.\n\n4. Share-price reaction to the last three earnings releases  \n\n   \u2022 Q3-25 (release 23 Oct 2025):  shares fell as much as -2.5 % intraday and finished the session down -1.3 % at US$247.24 (Yahoo Finance, 24 Oct 2025).  \n   \u2022 Q2-25 (release 24 Jul 2025, reported 25 Jul on pages):  stock jumped +6.5 % during the afternoon and closed at a new 52-week high of US$306.48, a one-day gain of roughly the same magnitude (Observer-Reporter, 25 Jul 2025).  \n   \u2022 Q1-25 (release 25 Apr 2025):  price spiked +9.3 % by late morning after the company beat estimates, initiated a dividend and raised guidance (Motley Fool, 25 Apr 2025).  End-of-day figures were not disclosed but no contrary closing data were reported during the session.  \n\n   Average absolute move over the three reports: about 5.7 %; two positive reactions and one negative.  This is larger than the stock\u2019s usual daily volatility (beta \u2248 0.6) but still well below the double-digit swings seen in many tech names, confirming management\u2019s description of VRSN as \u201cnot very volatile\u201d (Observer-Reporter, 25 Jul 2025).\n\n5. Residual information gaps and recommended next steps  \n\n   \u2022 Precise closing-price change for the 25 Apr 2025 earnings day is still missing; accessing historical NASDAQ tape data or a charting service would supply the exact figure.  \n   \u2022 A granular EPS-revision history (date, pre- and post-change numbers) is not openly published; retrieval would require subscription access to a broker-consensus database such as FactSet or Refinitiv.  \n   \u2022 Whether the arbitration panel will actually issue the .web decision before 11 Feb 2026 is uncertain.  Monitoring ICANN\u2019s Independent Review Process docket or the International Centre for Dispute Resolution\u2019s case log between December 2025 and February 2026 is advisable.  \n\nBarring those caveats, the publicly available evidence now provides a reasonably complete picture of VeriSign\u2019s likely news catalysts, analyst sentiment and stock-price sensitivity through the user\u2019s specified date.</Agent_report>\n"
