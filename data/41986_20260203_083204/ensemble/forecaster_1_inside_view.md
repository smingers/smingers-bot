## (a) Source Analysis

**Summary articles (from outside view):**

1. **Ballotpedia (State Supreme Courts, 2026):** Not relevant - covers state courts only, not US Supreme Court.

2. **Polymarket (Supreme Court vacancy, 2026):** Platform structure only, no current market odds provided. Created Dec 15, 2025. Low quality for prediction purposes.

3. **SCOTUSblog (Jan 21, 2026):** High quality, factual reporting on *Trump v. Cook* oral arguments. No direct relevance to SCOTUS composition changes, but demonstrates Court activity. Justice health/activity appears normal.

4. **Illinois Supreme Court retirement (Jan 29, 2026):** State court - not relevant.

5. **Newsweek (Clarence Thomas retirement odds):** Moderate-high quality. **Key factual data:** Kalshi prediction market shows 40% chance Thomas retires during Trump's term (down from 67% at inauguration). Thomas is 77 years old. **Expert opinion:** Trump stated Thomas and Alito should "absolutely not" step down. Thomas told interviewers in 2019 he's "not retiring."

6. **Mishpacha Magazine (Dec 23, 2025):** Low-moderate quality. **Opinion/speculation:** Author predicts SCOTUS retirement in 2026, likely Thomas (78) or Alito (76), characterized as "just a hunch." No expert credentials provided.

**AskNews articles:**

7. **Supreme Court "secretive" (Feb 2, 2026):** Factual reporting on NDAs for Court employees, low approval ratings (39-42% in 2025). No indication of imminent retirements. High quality source (NYT via Alternet).

8. **Legal industry predictions (Jan 14, 2026):** **Expert opinion from legal journalist:** "No Supreme Court justices are expected to retire in 2026, as Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito remain active and healthy, with Thomas especially influential in the current conservative majority." This is a named, credible source with SCOTUS expertise.

9. **Ronald Brownstein/CNN (Jan 10, 2026):** Focuses on VRA case impact on redistricting. No mention of SCOTUS composition changes. Confirms Court is actively hearing cases.

10. **TalkMarkets predictions (Jan 1, 2026):** Speculative predictions, no expert credentials. Mentions several Trump-related SCOTUS cases but no retirement predictions.

11. **Vox staff predictions (Jan 1, 2026):** **Moderate quality expert opinion:** "Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito is likely to retire before the end of 2026, given the risk of a Democratic-controlled Senate post-2026" - probability not specified but characterized as "likely."

12. **Washington Times predictions (Dec 31, 2025):** Speculative, disclaims use for investment/gambling. Predicts redistricting cases will be invalidated by SCOTUS. No retirement predictions.

13. **Occidental Dissent (Dec 20, 2025):** **Opinion:** "Clarence Thomas will retire before the 2026 midterms despite no immediate electoral urgency." Low credibility source (blog), but specific prediction.

**Factual vs. Opinion Summary:**
- **Facts:** Thomas is 77, Alito is 75; Kalshi market at 40% (down from 67%); no retirements announced; Trump opposes retirements
- **Expert opinions:** Legal journalist predicts NO retirements; Vox predicts Alito retirement is "likely"; Mishpacha and Occidental Dissent (non-experts) predict retirements
- **Key conflict:** Expert legal journalist vs. Vox staff prediction on retirements

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- **Kalshi market decline (67% → 40%):** Multiple data points showing downward trend in retirement speculation. This is structural market data reflecting aggregated beliefs. *Weight: Moderate-Strong* - suggests decreasing likelihood but over 4-year term, not 2026 specifically.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Expert legal journalist prediction (Jan 14, 2026):** Named source with SCOTUS expertise explicitly states "no retirements expected in 2026" with justification (Thomas/Alito "active and healthy"). *Weight: Moderate* - credible expert opinion but single source.
- **Vox prediction (Jan 1, 2026):** Alito retirement "likely" before end of 2026 due to Senate control risk. *Weight: Moderate* - expert team prediction with logical reasoning.
- **Trump's stated opposition (Dec 9, 2025):** Direct quote hoping justices don't retire. *Weight: Moderate* - influences voluntary retirement decisions.

**Weak evidence:**
- **Non-expert blog predictions:** Mishpacha and Occidental Dissent predict retirements. *Weight: Weak* - no demonstrated expertise.
- **Historical base rate (~15-20% annual):** *Weight: Weak-Moderate* - provides baseline but doesn't account for current specific circumstances.

**Evidence synthesis:**
The most credible expert (legal journalist, Jan 14) contradicts the Vox prediction (Jan 1). The Kalshi market trend shows declining retirement expectations. No concrete retirement announcements or health crises reported as of Feb 3, 2026.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 8 days (Feb 3 → Feb 11, 2026)

**Underlying question timeframe:** 11 months remaining in 2026 (Feb → Dec)

**Key consideration:** The meta-question asks about the *community prediction* on Feb 11, not the actual outcome. The community must assess probability of composition change across remaining 11 months.

**If timeframe halved (4 days):** Prediction would increase slightly - less time for news to shift community views, likely staying closer to current baseline.

**If timeframe doubled (16 days):** Prediction would decrease slightly - more time for potential retirement announcements or health news that could shift community prediction upward.

**Critical insight:** With only 8 days and no agent-reported news Jan 20-Feb 3, major shifts in community prediction are unlikely unless breaking news emerges.

## (d) Justification

**Base rate from outside view:** 38% chance community prediction exceeds 26%

**Factors shifting prediction:**

**Upward factors (toward higher probability community exceeds 26%):**
1. **Vox expert prediction (Moderate evidence):** Credible team predicts Alito retirement is "likely" in 2026. If community weights this, could push above 26%.
2. **11 months remaining:** Substantial time for unexpected events (deaths, health issues, surprise retirements).
3. **Age concerns:** Thomas 77, Alito 75 - actuarial risk exists.
4. **Political incentive:** If Republicans fear losing Senate in 2026 midterms, strategic retirement before midterms becomes logical.

**Downward factors (toward lower probability community exceeds 26%):**
1. **Expert legal journalist prediction (Moderate evidence):** Most recent expert (Jan 14, 2026) explicitly predicts NO retirements, citing justices are "active and healthy."
2. **Kalshi market decline (Moderate-Strong evidence):** 67% → 40% trend shows decreasing retirement expectations over 6 weeks.
3. **No news in past 2 weeks:** Agent confirms no relevant developments Jan 20-Feb 3.
4. **Trump's opposition:** Stated preference against retirements reduces voluntary retirement likelihood.
5. **Short forecast window:** Only 8 days for news to shift community views significantly.

**Reconciling conflicting expert opinions:**
- Legal journalist (Jan 14) is more recent and specific to 2026
- Vox prediction (Jan 1) is older and less definitive ("likely" without percentage)
- Market data (declining odds) supports legal journalist view

**Critical calibration question:** What probability would the Metaculus community assign on Feb 11 for SCOTUS composition change in 2026?

**Probability decomposition:**
- P(retirement announced by Feb 11) ≈ 2% (no current signals)
- P(retirement announced Feb 12-Dec 31) ≈ 12-15% (base rate with downward adjustment)
- P(death) ≈ 3-5% (actuarial for 9 justices, average age ~65)
- P(court expansion legislation) ≈ 1% (no active proposals)
- **Total: ~18-23% for composition change in 2026**

**Community prediction on Feb 11 likely range:** 18-25%

Given threshold is 26%, and likely community prediction is 18-25%, the probability of exceeding 26% is approximately 25-35%.

**Adjustment from outside view (38%):**
The expert legal journalist's recent, specific prediction (Jan 14) carries significant weight and wasn't available in outside view analysis. This moderately strong evidence shifts prediction downward from 38% to approximately 30%.

Probability calibration:

Starting from outside view of 38%, adjusting for:
- Recent expert prediction (Jan 14) of NO retirements: -8%
- Kalshi market decline confirming downward trend: -5%
- Vox prediction of Alito retirement: +5%

**Final calibrated probability: 30%**

This reflects:
- Community prediction likely in 18-25% range
- 26% threshold positioned at upper end of likely range
- Modest probability (~30%) that community assigns >26% due to uncertainty about unexpected events in remaining 11 months

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Metaculus community predict >26% probability of US Supreme Court composition change in 2026, measured on Feb 11, 2026?

2. **Base rate alignment:** Outside view established 38% based on historical SCOTUS change rates (~15-20% annually) and threshold positioning. Current prediction (30%) adjusts downward based on recent expert analysis and market trends.

3. **Consistency:** "30 out of 100 times, the Metaculus community prediction on Feb 11, 2026 exceeds 26% for SCOTUS composition change in 2026." This aligns with my assessment that community will likely predict 18-25%, with modest chance of exceeding threshold.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Expert legal journalist (Jan 14): NO retirements expected, justices "active and healthy" (Moderate)
   - Kalshi market: 67% → 40% decline in retirement odds (Moderate-Strong)
   - Vox prediction: Alito retirement "likely" in 2026 (Moderate)
   - No relevant news Jan 20-Feb 3, 2026 (Moderate)

5. **Blind spot:** Sudden health crisis or surprise retirement announcement in next 8 days would make this forecast look silly. Such news could push community prediction to 40-60%, well above threshold. Probability of this scenario: ~5-8%.

6. **Status quo:** Current situation is stable (no announcements, declining speculation). With only 8 days remaining, status quo strongly favors community prediction staying in 18-25% range, below 26% threshold.

Probability: 30%
