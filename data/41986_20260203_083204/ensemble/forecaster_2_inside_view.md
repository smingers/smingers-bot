(b) Evidence analysis:

**Strong evidence:**
- Trump's direct statement (Newsweek) that Thomas and Alito should "absolutely not" step down - this is the President directly discouraging retirements. However, justices are independent.
- Legal journalist prediction (14-Jan-2026) that no retirements will occur, citing Thomas and Alito remaining "active and healthy" - identifiable expert source.
- Kalshi market data showing only 40% chance of Thomas retirement by Jan 2029 (~8-15% annual rate) - liquid prediction market.

**Moderate evidence:**
- Multiple sources (Vox, Occidental Dissent, blog predictions) speculating about Thomas/Alito retirement before 2026 midterms due to Senate risk - logical political reasoning but highly speculative.
- Thomas's own 2019 statements that he has "no idea" about retirement and isn't planning it - dated but shows mindset.
- No news of health issues or retirement signals in recent coverage (agent report confirms this).

**Weak evidence:**
- Mishpacha "hunch" about retirement - pure speculation.
- Court approval ratings declining - doesn't predict retirements.
- Various anonymous blog predictions - no credibility.

**Key insight**: The underlying Metaculus question asks about "composition change" which includes both vacancies AND legislative changes to court size. However, court expansion is highly unlikely with Republican Congress.

(c) Timeframe analysis:

The prediction window is **8 days** (Feb 3 to Feb 11, 2026). This is extremely short.

The question asks whether the Metaculus community prediction will be >26% on Feb 11. We don't know the current value (Feb 3), but can reason about it:

- If current value is 24%, would need +2pp movement in 8 days to exceed 26%
- If current value is 28%, would need to stay elevated
- Metaculus communities typically show low volatility on slow-moving political questions over 1-week periods

**If timeframe halved (4 days)**: Even less likely to see significant movement; prediction would shift toward 50% (maximum uncertainty about current value).

**If timeframe doubled (16 days)**: Slightly more room for news-driven movement, but still unlikely to see major shifts absent actual retirement announcement.

The 8-day window means we're essentially predicting: "What is the current Metaculus community prediction?" with minimal drift expected.

(d) Justification:

**Base rate from outside view**: 23% (historical Metaculus start-of-year mean for SCOTUS change questions), σ=4%.

**Factors suggesting lower than 26%:**
1. **Trump's explicit opposition** to Thomas/Alito retirement - reduces political pressure
2. **Expert legal journalist prediction** of no retirements, citing justices being "active and healthy"
3. **Kalshi market data** implying only ~10-15% annual retirement probability for Thomas
4. **No recent news** of health issues, retirement signals, or court expansion legislation
5. **Short timeframe** means current value likely close to Feb 11 value

**Factors suggesting higher than 26%:**
1. **Political logic** that Thomas (78) or Alito (76) might retire before potential 2026 midterm losses
2. **Multiple predictions** (Vox, blogs) suggesting retirement possible
3. **Unknown current value** - if already >26%, likely to stay there

**Synthesis:**
The strongest evidence points to no imminent retirement: Trump opposition, expert prediction, market data, no news signals. The speculative predictions about strategic retirement are logical but unsupported by concrete evidence.

The critical unknown is the current Metaculus value. Given:
- Base rate of 23% for such questions
- Strong evidence against imminent change
- 8-day window with low expected volatility

I estimate the current community prediction is likely in the 20-25% range. The probability it exceeds 26% on Feb 11 is the probability it's currently >26% plus the small probability of a >3pp upward drift.

Using normal distribution: P(X > 26% | μ=23%, σ=4%) ≈ 22%
Adding small probability for: (a) current value already elevated, (b) unexpected news: +3-5%

**Final estimate: 25-27%**

Probability calibration:

Starting from outside view base rate of 23% (±4%), the question becomes: what's the probability the Metaculus community is currently forecasting >26% for SCOTUS composition change in 2026?

The strongest evidence (Trump statements, expert predictions, market data) suggests justices are NOT planning to retire, which should push community predictions below historical average. However, the political logic of strategic retirement before midterms has merit.

Given:
- 8-day window means minimal drift expected
- Strong evidence against imminent change
- Unknown current value but likely near base rate
- Small tail risk of unexpected news

I calibrate to **26%** - slightly above the probability that a normal distribution centered at 23% exceeds 26%, accounting for:
- Uncertainty about current Metaculus value
- Possible elevated community concern about strategic retirements
- Small probability of news catalyst in next 8 days

A 10% shift would mean:
- 16%: Would require very strong confidence current value is <24% - too confident given uncertainty
- 36%: Would require belief current value likely >26% already - unsupported by evidence

26% feels calibrated: roughly 1-in-4 chance the community is currently forecasting >26%.

Checklist:
1. **Paraphrase**: Will Metaculus community predict >26% probability of US Supreme Court composition change in 2026, measured on Feb 11?
2. **Base rate**: 23% historical mean for start-of-year SCOTUS change predictions, σ=4%. Final prediction (26%) stays close to base rate, justified by lack of strong contrary evidence.
3. **Consistency**: "26 out of 100 times, the Metaculus community prediction on Feb 11 exceeds 26%." This aligns with slight uncertainty about current value being near but possibly above threshold.
4. **Key evidence**: (1) Trump opposes Thomas/Alito retirement, (2) Legal expert predicts no 2026 retirements, (3) Kalshi shows only 40% chance Thomas retires by 2029, (4) No recent retirement signals, (5) 8-day window limits movement.
5. **Blind spot**: Thomas or Alito announces sudden retirement in next 8 days due to undisclosed health issue - would spike community prediction well above 26%. Probability ~3-5%.
6. **Status quo**: Current situation is stable (no retirement signals), 8-day window reinforces minimal change expected. Slight nudge toward status quo (staying near base rate) already incorporated.

Probability: 26%
