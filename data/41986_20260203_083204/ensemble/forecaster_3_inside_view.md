Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / resolution alignment
This resolves “Yes” iff the Metaculus community prediction for Q41072 (“Will the composition of the US Supreme Court change in 2026?”) is >26.00% at 2026-02-11 01:02:19; otherwise “No.”

(a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; facts vs opinions)
- Ballotpedia state supreme court vacancies (2026, undated-as-loaded): High-quality for state courts, but irrelevant to US SCOTUS composition. No usable signal. (Facts; not about SCOTUS.)
- Polymarket “Supreme Court vacancy in 2026?” (market page): Relevant conceptually, but the provided scrape lacks the current price/odds; volume is tiny ($852). Low evidentiary value. (Mostly rules; no usable market probability.)
- SCOTUSblog (2026-01-21, Amy Howe): High-quality SCOTUS reporting, but about *Trump v. Cook* (Fed governor removal). No direct indication of retirements/resignations/court expansion. (Facts about a case; no composition signal.)
- WAND-TV Illinois Supreme Court retirement (2026-01-??): Not SCOTUS. Irrelevant. (Facts; wrong court.)
- Newsweek on Clarence Thomas retirement odds (recent as of 2026-02-03 context): Mainstream outlet; cites Kalshi pricing: ~40% Thomas resigns before end of Trump term, down from 67%. This is relevant as an “expectations/markets” datapoint, though it’s about the full term not specifically 2026. (Facts: market odds + quotes; also some punditry.)
- Mishpacha “Big, Bold 2026 Predictions” (2025-12-23): Pure pundit “hunch” that a conservative justice may retire in 2026. Low reliability. (Opinion.)
- Alternet summary of NYT-style reporting re NDAs/“secretive” court (2026-02-02): Potentially based on credible reporting, but not directly tied to composition change. (Institutional atmosphere; not composition.)
- AskNews: Bloomberg Law “7 predictions for legal industry in 2026” (2026-01-14): Credible legal journalism; explicitly predicts *no* SCOTUS retirements in 2026. This is relevant expert-ish opinion, but still a single commentator prediction. (Opinion; moderate weight.)
- AskNews: Vox staff predictions (2026-01-01): Mixed staff/expert panel; includes a claim that Alito is “likely” to retire before end of 2026. Identifiable outlet but still punditry; moderate-to-weak. (Opinion.)
- AskNews: FreeRepublic/Trump post claiming an emergency ruling ending nationwide injunctions (2026-02-01): Extremely low reliability in this form; also unrelated to composition. Discard. (Likely misinformation / not corroborated.)

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted factors for whether Metaculus community will be >26% on Feb 11)
Key point: we are forecasting the *crowd’s probability* on Feb 11, not the underlying 2026 event. With only 8 days, the crowd number will mostly reflect (i) base rates + (ii) salient narratives (Thomas/Alito age; strategic retirement) + (iii) any fresh retirement/health/court-expansion news (none apparent in sources).

Strong evidence
- Structural/base-rate anchor: modern-era SCOTUS composition changes occur often enough that an annual probability around the high-20s/low-30s is plausible. This tends to keep a Metaculus community forecast from drifting too low absent strong “no retirement” signals. (Historical pattern; structural.)

Moderate evidence
- Kalshi/market signal (via Newsweek): 40% that Thomas resigns before end of Trump’s term, and that probability has *fallen*. This modestly pulls 2026-specific change probability down and may influence Metaculus forecasters who look at markets. (Single but method-based source; indirect mapping to 2026.)
- Competing pundit expectations: Bloomberg Law predicts no retirements (downward pressure), Vox predicts Alito retirement likely (upward pressure). Net effect: probably keeps community near a “murky but nontrivial” zone rather than collapsing below mid-20s.

Weak evidence
- Mishpacha “hunch” about retirement: low signal.
- SCOTUS institutional “secrecy” / NDAs: not causally tied to composition.
- Polymarket page without odds: no actionable number.

Net evidentiary pull vs the 26% threshold:
- I see more reasons for the Metaculus community to sit *around* ~28–35% than to sit at ~20–25%, primarily because (1) two older conservative justices + (2) strategic-retirement narrative before/around midterms is salient in public forecasting discourse, even if not “hard” evidence.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time until snapshot: ~8 days (2026-02-03 → 2026-02-11).
- Because the snapshot window is short, the main driver is “what is the community already around now?” rather than new information. Big moves would likely require a concrete catalyst (credible retirement/health report, legislative court-expansion push, etc.).
- If the snapshot window were halved (~4 days): even less chance of meaningful drift; probability would move closer to my best guess of the *current* crowd being above 26.
- If doubled (~16 days): slightly higher chance of news-driven movement, but still modest; absent catalysts, the community would likely remain in the same band.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside view)
Outside view was 58% “Yes” (i.e., crowd >26%). I’m nudging upward because:
- The threshold (26%) is slightly below the plausible “default” crowd estimate for a full-year SCOTUS composition-change question when at least two justices are in their mid/late 70s and the strategic-retirement narrative is actively circulating (Vox/Bloomberg Law pieces indicate it’s in the discourse either way).
- The strongest counterweight is the *downward* trend in Thomas-retirement term-odds (Kalshi down to 40%) plus at least one credible commentator predicting no retirements in 2026. That argues against pushing this too high (i.e., not 75–85%).
Overall, I expect Metaculus to be modestly above 26% on Feb 11 unless there is a specific “no retirement” signal that has already pulled it to the low-20s—which I don’t see strong evidence for in the provided material.

Probability calibration
- Starting point (outside view): 58%
- Upward considerations: salience of strategic-retirement narrative + low-ish threshold (+8)
- Downward considerations: market odds for Thomas retirement over full term have fallen; credible “no retirements in 2026” punditry (-0 to -2)
Net inside-view: ~66%

Checklist:
1) Criteria: “Yes” iff Metaculus community forecast on 2026-02-11 01:02:19 for Q41072 is >26%.
2) Outside view base rate used: 58% (from provided outside-view analysis).
3) Consistency: 66 out of 100 times, the community forecast at snapshot is >26%. Plausible given expected crowd level near high-20s/low-30s.
4) Top evidence: (i) annual SCOTUS change base-rate plausibly ~high-20s/low-30s; (ii) two elderly conservative justices + strategic-retirement narrative; (iii) Kalshi term-odds for Thomas down to 40% (pulls down); (iv) Bloomberg Law says no retirements (pulls down); (v) Vox says Alito likely retire (pulls up).
5) Blind spot: If Metaculus is currently anchored around ~20–25% (more skeptical than I’m assuming) and no news arrives, I’ll be too high → would push probability toward ~40–50%.
6) Status quo: With only 8 days, the crowd likely doesn’t move much; forecast mainly reflects where it already is.

Probability: 66%
