Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Newsweek (date 2026-01-?) – cites Kalshi market at 40 % that Justice Clarence Thomas resigns before Trump leaves office; quotes Thomas’s own 2019 “not retiring” remarks and Trump’s public wish that no conservative retire.  Quality: mainstream U.S. magazine, identifiable market data.  Factual content = Kalshi price, ages; opinions = author’s speculation and Trump rhetoric.  
2. Polymarket contract page (live since 2025-12-15) – rules for “U.S. Supreme Court vacancy in 2026”. No price in excerpt; still confirms an active crypto market trading on the same outcome.  Quality: primary-source rules, no odds.  
3. Mishpacha op-ed (2025-12-23) – columnist’s “hunch” that a justice retires in 2026, probably Thomas or Alito.  Quality: opinion, weak evidence; author not a recognised court expert.  
4. LessWrong / Metaculus-related articles – only mention that Metaculus exists; no direct information about present community median.  Quality: irrelevant to resolution.  
5. SCOTUSblog case report (2026-01-21) – detailed look at Trump v. Cook; shows all nine justices active and healthy in late January.  Quality: gold-standard court reporting; indirectly indicates no vacancies as of two weeks ago.  
6. No credible articles (past 30 days) announcing retirement, death, court-packing bill, or serious illness of any justice.  Quality: negative evidence.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Historical annual frequency of a SCOTUS seat becoming vacant ≈ 35 % (1869-2025 average) – structural, hard to change.  
Moderate evidence  
• Kalshi 40 % probability that Thomas resigns by Jan-20-29 ⇒ implies ~12-15 % per-year hazard for Thomas; adding Alito and baseline death risk pushes “any change in 2026” into high-20s/low-30s.  
• Metaculus community medians on similar long-horizon questions are usually close to the actuarial base rate unless news breaks, and they drift slowly week-to-week (empirical observation).  
Weak evidence  
• Magazine “bold predictions” and pundit columns asserting a 2026 retirement.  
• General political chatter about court expansion (Democrats out of power; no live bill).

Net evidence: current facts point to a low-30s true probability of a 2026 change and no catalyst in the next eight days to shift community sentiment sharply.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Time to resolution snapshot: 8 days.  
• Metaculus medians in institutional questions typically move ≤1–1.5 percentage-points per week absent major news.  
• If the window were halved (4 days) I’d nudge probability 2 pp toward status-quo; if doubled (16 days) I’d widen the band and move 2 pp toward the base-rate mean because the chance of a surprise announcement grows slightly.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base: 60 % that the community median naturally sits above 26 % (assuming “any 2026 change” ≈ 30–32 %).  
Down-adjust 4 pp for the risk that the present Metaculus value is already ≤26 % (we lack the live number).  
Down-adjust 3 pp for typical slow negative drift when no news arrives (forecaster over-excitement decays).  
Up-adjust 5 pp for the possibility that even a rumour (health scare, retirement speculation) would trigger a quick uptick, and those rumours surface frequently during the term.  
Net: 60 % − 4 % − 3 % + 5 % ≈ 58 %.

Probability calibration
I therefore assign a 58 % chance that the Metaculus community prediction for “Will the composition of the US Supreme Court change in 2026?” exceeds 26 % at 01:02 UTC on 11 Feb 2026.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “On 11 Feb 2026 will Metaculus median for a 2026 SCOTUS composition change be >26 %?”  
2. Base-rate = 35 % annual vacancy; mapped to ~60 % chance community >26 %.  
3. Consistency: “58 times in 100, the snapshot median is >26 %.” Sounds plausible vs reasoning.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Historical 35 % annual vacancy rate.  
   • Kalshi price implies low-30s event chance.  
   • No vacancy news as of 3 Feb 2026.  
   • Metaculus medians drift slowly (<1 pp/week).  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden health emergency or retirement press release (e.g., Thomas) between 3–11 Feb sending median >45 %. Would raise odds materially (>80 %).  
6. Status-quo bias checked: with only 8 days and quiet news, lean slightly to current level; adjustment applied above.

Probability: 58%
