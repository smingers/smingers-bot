Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Newsweek/Kalshi (Jan 2026). Real-money market giving 40 % chance Clarence Thomas retires before Jan 2029.  Good behavioural signal; multi-year horizon dilutes yearly risk.  
2. Polymarket (opened Dec 2025). Real-money market on “any 2026 vacancy”, but current price not disclosed.  Structural parallel but no numeric input.  
3. Mishpacha “Big, Bold 2026 Predictions” (Dec 2025).  Pure punditry (“just a hunch”).  Weak evidential weight.  
4. SCOTUSblog (Jan 2026).  Detailed court coverage; confirms no health or retirement news from any justice.  High factual reliability; implies status quo.  
5. Less relevant pieces (state-court retirements, economy, ECB, etc.) – no bearing on US-SCOTUS composition.  Ignored for forecasting.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• 28 % historical base rate that at least one SCOTUS seat changes in a calendar year (1990-2025, 10 changes/36 yrs).  
Structural, hard to move quickly.

Moderate evidence  
• Kalshi hazard for Thomas converts to ≈9 % single-year risk; similar for Alito; aggregate ≈15-18 % → community likely to shade below historical 28 %.  
• No new medical/retirement rumours (SCOTUSblog, Jan 2026) keeps crowd anchored near prior.

Weak evidence  
• Magazine/blog pundit predictions of a 2026 retirement (Mishpacha, Vox, Occidental Dissent).  Anecdotal.  
• Possibility of Congressional seat-expansion legislation — no bill has meaningful traction; very low probability in 8-day window.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Question resolves in 8 days (03 → 11 Feb 2026).  Weekly volatility of Metaculus community medians on personnel questions is typically σ ≈ 3 pp.  Halving the window (4 days) would lower volatility to ≈2 pp and trim the “jump” chance; doubling (16 days) would raise σ toward 4 pp and slightly increase the tail risk of an unexpected vacancy.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Base-rate anchors community around 26 – 28 %.  Kalshi & absence of news press it downward a few points.  Round-number stickiness (25 %) and low short-term volatility suggest current median is probably 24 – 26 %.  
Model: μ ≈ 25 %, σ ≈ 3 pp ⇒ P(Metaculus > 26) ≈ 37 %.  
Add 3 % chance of shock retirement/health story within 8 days that would propel the crowd well above 26 % (≈95 % if it happens).  Marginal increases probability by ≈2 pp.  
Net inside-view probability ≈38 %.

Probability calibration
Best estimate that on 11 Feb 2026 the Metaculus community prediction for “Will the composition of the US Supreme Court change in 2026?” exceeds 26.00 %: 38 %.  
90 % confidence interval for the true probability: 22 % – 55 %.  Biggest swing factor: unforeseen retirement announcement.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: On 11 Feb 2026 will Metaculus crowd > 26 % on SCOTUS-composition-change-in-2026?  
2. Outside base rate 28 %; final forecast firmly referenced.  
3. “38 times in 100, the crowd will be >26 % on the stated date.”  
4. Key evidence: (i) 28 % historical vacancy rate; (ii) Kalshi implies <20 % one-year risk; (iii) zero current vacancy rumours; (iv) Metaculus one-week σ ≈ 3 pp.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden justice illness/death or credible retirement leak before 11 Feb could spike the crowd above 50 %.  
6. Status quo favours a sub-26 % prediction; short horizon argues for mild reversion toward current level.

Probability: 38%
