Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. KFOX (Dec-09-2025) – Factual interview quotes from Donald Trump urging Justices Thomas (77) and Alito (75) not to retire.  No concrete evidence of impending vacancies.  Reliable for the fact that Trump publicly discourages retirements; does not change actuarial reality.  
2. Newsweek (undated headline scrap, Feb-03-2026) – Merely notes that Trump “floated Ted Cruz” as a possible nominee; no new information on any justice’s plans.  Low informational value.  
3. Newsweek (probability article, Jan-2026) – Cites Kalshi market giving a 40 % chance Thomas will leave before Jan-2029.  That is a multi-year figure; roughly translates to ≈12 % per year if hazards are flat, ≈9 % for calendar-year 2026.  Source is a real-money market, hence higher weight than punditry.  
4. Texas, North Dakota, West Virginia state-court stories (Jan-2026) – Not about the U.S. Supreme Court; no bearing on vacancies but show that “court-packing” headlines can be noise.  
5. Agent report (Feb-03-2026) – Confirms (i) zero SCOTUS retirement/health news 20 Jan–03 Feb, (ii) no federal court-expansion moves, (iii) historical prediction history unavailable without an authenticated pull.  Qualitative summary judged sound.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Possible classes:  
• Annual probability that at least one SCOTUS seat changes.  10 changes in 36 calendar years (1990-2025) → 28 %.  
• Probability in the *first quarter* of a year: of the 10 events above, only 2 occurred Jan-Mar (Rehnquist death oscillated across months; counting generously gives ≈6 %).  
• Market-based hazard for Thomas only in calendar-2026 ≈9 %.  Adding Alito and low-probability health shocks to any justice yields perhaps 15-18 % total.  
Because the Metaculus target asks about the entire year 2026 (not Q1) but our meta-question covers only what *forecasters* think on 11 Feb, the broad “annual-change” class (28 %) is the most appropriate baseline for what a well-informed crowd would anchor on.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Now until resolution of this meta-question: 8 days (03 Feb → 11 Feb 2026).  Metaculus community medians typically drift slowly; one-week 1-sigma moves for questions of this type are ≈2–3 pp.  Therefore today’s unknown community number is likely to remain in the same ballpark by 11 Feb unless a shock occurs (retirement, hospitalisation, credible leak), which recent news suggests is unlikely.

(d) Justification  
• Base rate for a 2026 change ≈28 % (reference class).  
• No fresh signals pointing to imminent vacancies; Kalshi’s multi-year odds back-solve to <20 % for 2026.  These would pull the crowd slightly *below* the 28 % base.  
• Psychological anchoring: the number 25 % is a natural Schelling point and convenient “one-in-four” heuristic; Metaculus medians often cluster at roundish figures.  
• Volatility over the coming week is low (no oral-argument weeks, no budget deadlines, no health rumours), so whatever today’s median is, ±3 pp captures 80–90 % of possibilities by 11 Feb.  
Taken together, the outside view says: most likely the community prediction sits just under the 26 % line and stays there; only modest probability mass lies above 26 % on 11 Feb.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: historical 28 % → initial 28.  
Adjustment 1 (Kalshi & absence of news): −4 → 24.  
Adjustment 2 (round-number stickiness may pull the community toward 25 instead of 24): +1 → 25.  
Short-term volatility (σ≈3 pp) means the chance that a 25 % median crosses 26 % in 8 days is ≈Φ((25+0.5−26)/3) = Φ(-0.17) ≈ 43 % if mean exactly 25.  Averaging over uncertainty in the current mean (±2 pp) lowers it modestly.  Net probability ≈29 %.

Outside View Prediction:
29 %

(This is my best estimate—before looking at the hidden, real-time Metaculus series—of the probability that the community prediction exceeds 26.00 % on 11 Feb 2026.)
