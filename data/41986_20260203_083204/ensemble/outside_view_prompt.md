You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 26.00% on 2026-02-11 for the Metaculus question "Will the composition of the US Supreme Court change in 2026?"?

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41072) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-11 01:02:19 is higher than 26.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 26.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-11 01:02:19, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

# Summary of Article: "Trump hopes Supreme Court's Thomas, Alito hold off retirement"

**Source:** KFOX  
**Date:** December 09, 2025

## Key Facts and Statements:

### Trump's Position on Justice Retirements:
- In a Monday interview with Politico's Dasha Burns, President Trump stated he hopes Justices Clarence Thomas (77) and Samuel Alito (75) do not retire during his term
- Trump quote: "Well, I hope they stay because I think they're fantastic. Okay? Both of those men are fantastic."
- A vacancy would allow Trump to appoint another justice before leaving the White House

### Trump's Claims About Democratic Court Expansion Plans:
- Trump claimed Democrats want to "flood" the court, appearing to reference potential court-packing
- In a Friday Truth Social post, Trump stated Democrats' "number one policy push" is to add 12 justices to the Supreme Court (bringing total to 21)
- Trump claimed this could be done by eliminating the Senate filibuster
- Trump quote: "The Radical Left Democrats are looking at 21 justices, with immediate ascension. This would be terrible for our Country."

### Democratic Response and Context:
- Neither House Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries nor Senate leader Chuck Schumer responded to The National News Desk's request for comment
- **No Democrat has publicly announced any intention to expand the court** (per the article)
- Former Attorney General Eric Holder said in a podcast interview last month that Democrats should consider expanding the Supreme Court if they win the presidency, House, and Senate in 2028
- Holder quote: "I think, you know, the reality is – it pains me to say this – I think the Supreme Court is a broken institution"
- Holder stated Supreme Court reform "has to be considered" if there is a Democratic trifecta in 2028

**Note:** The article indicates it's unclear why Trump believes Democrats are prioritizing adding justices, aside from Holder's comments about potential 2028 reforms.

# Summary of Article: "Will Clarence Thomas retire from Supreme Court during Donald Trump's term?"

**Source:** Newsweek

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Current odds of Thomas retiring:** 40% chance that Justice Clarence Thomas will resign before Trump leaves office, according to Kalshi (a prediction market)
- **Historical trend:** When Trump was inaugurated for his second term, there was a 67% chance Thomas would resign. This likelihood has steadily decreased and is now at its lowest point (40%) except for December 9, when it briefly dropped to 39%
- **Thomas's age and tenure:** Thomas has served since 1991 and is the oldest justice currently on the Court
- **Typical retirement age:** In recent decades, justices have typically stepped down in their late 70s to early 80s
- **Senate composition:** Republicans have a 53-person majority in the Senate, giving them the simple majority needed to confirm a nomination
- **Current Court composition:** 6-3 conservative majority, with Trump having nominated three of the eight justices

## Named Source Opinions:

- **Donald Trump:** Called Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito "fantastic" and said they should "absolutely not" step down, arguing criticism was politically motivated. Also floated Senator Ted Cruz as a potential Supreme Court nominee, calling him a "brilliant legal name" and "brilliant man"
- **Clarence Thomas (2019 statements):** 
  - Told Pepperdine University president-elect James Gash that he's "not retiring"
  - When asked if he'd retire in 20 or 30 years, answered no to both
  - Told David Rubenstein he had "no idea" where retirement rumors originated

## Additional Context:

- Thomas has faced scrutiny over ethics controversies and his wife's political activism, spurring demands from some Democrats and watchdog groups that he resign
- Outside pressure, including John Oliver's million-dollar resignation offer, has had little effect on Thomas
- If Republicans lose control of the Senate in November midterms, Trump would need to put forward a nominee that Democrats would vote to confirm
- Cruz is 55 years old, which would represent a multi-decade appointment if nominated

# Summary of Article: Texas becomes first state to end American Bar Association oversight of law schools

**Key Facts:**

- **Date:** January 6, 2026
- **Action:** Texas Supreme Court issued an order finalizing a tentative September opinion to eliminate American Bar Association (ABA) oversight of its law schools
- **Historical context:** Texas had relied on ABA accreditation for 42 years (since 1983, when the Texas Supreme Court transferred this responsibility to the ABA)
- **Impact:** Texas law school graduates wanting to practice in Texas no longer need to attend an ABA-accredited school; approval power now rests with the Texas Supreme Court
- **Court composition:** All nine justices signed the order (noted as an "all-Republican court")

**Court's Stated Intentions:**
- Preserve graduates' ability to use Texas law school degrees in other states and vice versa
- No immediate changes anticipated to current list of approved law schools
- Could potentially rely on a different multi-state accrediting entity in the future
- Will use "simple, objective, and ideologically neutral criteria using metrics no more onerous than those currently required by the ABA"

**Background on ABA Accreditation:**
- ABA has accredited law schools nationally since 1923
- Requirements include: faculty/curriculum/facilities standards, student support resources, commitment to diversity and inclusion, successful bar passage rates

**Political Context:**
- President Donald Trump issued an executive order stripping ABA of millions in USAID and State Department funding
- Attorney General Pam Bondi sent a letter alleging ABA's diversity requirements conflicted with 2023 Supreme Court decision ending affirmative action in college admissions
- Two FTC officials supported Texas's move, claiming ABA has a monopoly that harms competition
- FTC Chair Andrew Ferguson banned FTC political appointees from associating with ABA in February

**Opposition/Support:**
- Deans from 8 of 10 Texas ABA-accredited law schools opposed the change in July, citing concerns about lawyer mobility and costs
- University of Texas School of Law dean did not sign opposition letter, instead encouraged exploring alternatives

**Other States:**
- Florida, Ohio, and Tennessee are considering similar moves away from ABA accreditation

## Summary of Article

**Key Facts:**

- **State:** North Dakota (not US federal)
- **Justice:** Daniel Crothers, North Dakota Supreme Court Justice
- **Retirement Date:** February 28, 2026
- **Length of Service:** Over 20 years on the North Dakota Supreme Court
- **Appointment History:** 
  - Appointed to the Supreme Court in 2005 by then-Governor John Hoeven
  - Elected to a 10-year term in 2012
  - Re-elected to another 10-year term in 2022

**Replacement Process:**
Under North Dakota state law:
1. A Judicial Nominating Committee must forward a list of nominees to the governor within 60 days of receiving notice of the vacancy
2. Within 30 days of receiving the list, the governor has three options:
   - Appoint from the list of nominees
   - Return the list and direct the committee to reconvene
   - Call for a special election to fill the vacancy

**Relevance to Forecasting Question:**

This article concerns the **North Dakota State Supreme Court**, not the **US Supreme Court**. The forecasting question specifically asks about changes to the composition of the US Supreme Court in 2026. This retirement announcement is therefore **not relevant** to the target Metaculus question, as it involves a state-level court rather than the federal Supreme Court.

# Summary of Article: "Titus officially sworn in to Supreme Court of Appeals - WV MetroNews"

**Key Facts:**
- Gerald M. Titus III was officially sworn in as a Justice to West Virginia's Supreme Court of Appeals on January 22, 2026
- Chief Justice Haley Bunn administered the oath in a ceremony on Wednesday
- Titus was appointed by Governor Patrick Morrisey in November (2025) to fill a vacancy
- The vacancy was created by the death of Justice Tim Armstead, who died weeks before Titus's November appointment
- Titus had already been serving in the role for several weeks before the formal investiture ceremony
- Titus is a Spencer native from Roane County, West Virginia

**Context:**
This article is about a **state-level** Supreme Court (West Virginia's Supreme Court of Appeals), not the U.S. Supreme Court. Therefore, this article contains **no information relevant** to the forecasting question, which concerns changes to the composition of the **U.S. Supreme Court** in 2026.

Query: Retrieve full time-series of Metaculus question 41072 community prediction since Jan 1 2026 and summarize trends; list any SCOTUS retirement or court-expansion news reported between 2026-01-20 and 2026-02-03 that could affect forecasts.
The user’s request has two parts:

PART 1 – Metaculus question 41072: daily community-median probability from 1 Jan 2026 to “present”

• None of the articles, forum posts, or code snippets returned in the search results contain the actual day-by-day numbers for question 41072.  
• The only potentially useful hit is a GitHub file (“metaculus-rs/PredictionHistory.md”) that documents an unofficial Rust wrapper around the Metaculus API and describes an endpoint that serves the historical prediction JSON for any question (GitHub, undated). Unfortunately, the repository does not embed or link to a pre-downloaded data file for question 41072, nor does it give a worked URL example whose response is cached by the Internet Archive.  
• Because no other source (Metaforecast, EA Forum posts, blog analyses, cached CSVs, etc.) surfaced in the results, the raw time-series remains unavailable. Without it, the trend summary (e.g., whether the community probability rose on specific days, reacted to news, or drifted) cannot be produced.

Practical next step if the numbers are still required  
The GitHub documentation implies that the series can be fetched directly from Metaculus once an authentication token is supplied.  A researcher with a Metaculus account could therefore:

1. Log in to Metaculus in a browser, open the Network tab, and refresh the question page to capture the “prediction_history” API call.  
2. Copy the URL (typically https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/41072/prediction_history/?format=json) together with the “Cookie” header that contains the session token.  
3. Download the JSON and parse the list of (timestamp, community_prediction) pairs.  

No violation of terms of service is involved—Metaculus exposes this endpoint to every logged-in user—so this is the only viable route to obtain the full series.

Information gap that remains  
Until that authenticated pull is performed, the time-series and any derived trend description are still missing.

PART 2 – Any U.S. Supreme Court retirement or court-expansion news reported 20 Jan 2026 – 3 Feb 2026

A double-check of the news corpus produced the following:

1. Retirements, resignations, deaths – NONE.  
   • No SCOTUSblog post, major-paper article, or wire-service piece inside the window reports a justice signaling retirement, submitting a resignation, or experiencing a life-threatening health event.  
   • Speculative pieces about Clarence Thomas’s eventual exit (e.g., Newsweek feature on odds trading) pre-date the window and carry no new development between 20 Jan and 3 Feb 2026.

2. Federal court-expansion (i.e., proposals to add seats to the U.S. Supreme Court) – NONE.  
   • Congress.gov, SCOTUSblog round-ups, and mainstream outlets show no bill introduction, White House trial balloon, or advocacy-group push to alter the size of the federal Supreme Court during the period.

3. Potentially confusing stories—STATE-level court expansion  
   • Utah: On 31 Jan 2026 the Republican-controlled legislature passed, and on 1 Feb 2026 Governor Spencer Cox signed, SB 134, which immediately expands the Utah Supreme Court from five to seven justices (Salt Lake Tribune, 31 Jan 2026; ABC News wire, 1 Feb 2026).  Although headlines used the phrase “court-packing,” this measure affects only Utah’s judiciary.  
   • Ballotpedia’s Daily Brew of 9 Jan 2026 (outside but adjacent to the window) and ABC News coverage (within the window) both emphasise that the Utah high court itself had “essentially no backlog” and did not request the extra seats.  Legal scholars quoted in the stories warned of an erosion of judicial independence, but again the development is strictly state-level.

4. Other Supreme Court coverage in the window  
   • The Guardian live politics blog on 21 Jan 2026 notes that “the supreme court did not issue a decision today on [the] tariffs case,” but makes no mention of any justice’s status or of structural reform proposals.  The item therefore has no bearing on vacancy odds.

Net assessment for forecasters  
Between 20 Jan and 3 Feb 2026 there was:

• Zero factual movement toward a U.S. Supreme Court vacancy.  
• Zero federal-level momentum for enlarging the Court.  
• One high-visibility but state-specific expansion (Utah) that could momentarily confuse inattentive algorithmic scrapers or casual observers but should not rationally shift probabilities on Metaculus question 41072.

Therefore, any change in the community prediction during that fortnight—once the data are eventually obtained—would most likely reflect noise, gradual time-decay toward the question’s closing date, or individual forecasters’ idiosyncratic updates, not substantive news about SCOTUS composition.

Remaining information gaps  
A. The numeric daily series for question 41072 (see Part 1).  
B. (For completeness) confirmation from congressional databases that no court-expansion bill was introduced in late January 2026.  All open sources consulted so far agree on this negative finding, but a PACER or Congress.gov search would eliminate residual doubt.

With respect to the original user request, Part 2 is fully satisfied; Part 1 still requires the authenticated API pull described above.

The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
