Analysis:
The Metaculus community estimate has sat exactly at 26 % for the past few days, so even a modest shift in sentiment could move it above or below the threshold by 11 Feb.  The largest drivers of short-term swings are (1) any credible hint that a justice is preparing to retire or is in poor health, and (2) progress on court-expansion legislation.  In early 2026 the spotlight is on the two oldest conservatives—Clarence Thomas (77) and Samuel Alito (75)—because Republicans still control the Senate and could replace them quickly.  Recent interviews, public appearances, or health-related absences could therefore matter.  In addition, Democrats have re-introduced several “Supreme Court Term Limits” and “Expand the Court” bills each January; if one unexpectedly gains bipartisan sponsorship or advances out of committee, forecasters might raise the probability of a 2026 composition change.  Consequently, the most relevant current information consists of:

• Fresh reporting on any justice’s health, travel cancelations, or statements about tenure  
• Capitol-Hill coverage of new or advancing bills that would alter the Court’s size  
• Commentaries or insider leaks suggesting strategic timing of retirements before the 2026 mid-term election cycle intensifies
