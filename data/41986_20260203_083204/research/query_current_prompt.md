Wade, allowing states to [ban](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-abortion-bans) abortions. Trump v. United States [offers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._United_States) US presidents absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for all "official acts" (interpreted broadly) during a presidency. Important cases before the Court at the time of question writing include [Louisiana v. Callais](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40417/will-scotus-strike-down-louisianas-congressional-map-restoring-gop-lean/), which could strike down a majority-Black congressional district and restore Republican-leaning a map to Louisiana and other Deep South states; and [Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/39893/scotus-ruling-on-tariffs-in-2025/), in which the Court is to decide on the legality of many of Donald Trump's tariffs imposed in 2025.

> Supreme Court justices are confirmed by a simple majority of the Senate. At the time of this question, the Metaculus Community had Democrats with a [32% chance ](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/36370/us-senate-plurality-after-2026-midterms/)of taking control of the US Senate in the 2026 midterm elections, which would greatly complicate Trump's ability to get his Supreme Court nominees confirmed, if it were to occur.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41072) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-11 01:02:19 is higher than 26.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 26.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-11 01:02:19, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For AskNews:
Your query for AskNews will be processed more naturally, so feel free to write a sentence-long query in natural language. Avoid using ambiguous acronyms. Specify relevant criteria (e.g., geography, industry, time period) to ensure the correct scope. If desired, you can indicate multiple kinds of news articles you're looking for in your query. Keep your query to a maximum of two sentences. Important note: Do not prefix your query with 'AskNews:' or something similar. Please add the word 'AskNews' enclosed in brackets at the end of the query, referring closely to the example below.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () (NOT curly brackets, NOT square brackets [], you need to use normal brackets ()) **on the same line as and after** the query, applicable for Google, Google News and AskNews. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for AskNews.

Use the following verification checklist:
1. One query for google?
2. One query for google news?
3. One query for AskNews?
4. All queries followed by either (Google), (Google News) or (AskNews) in brackets () on the same line as the query?
