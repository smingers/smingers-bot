Analysis:
The forecasting hinge is whether the Metaculus community prediction for a Supreme Court change in 2026 nudges upward by >0.00 ppt over the next eight days.  Historically, sudden jumps in similar Metaculus questions have been triggered by:
• breaking health news or retirement chatter involving elderly justices (Thomas 77, Alito 75, Sotomayor 71)
• credible reporting on a Court-expansion bill advancing in Congress
• large shifts in Senate-control expectations (confirmation odds)
Therefore the most relevant historical context is:
1. Any very recent or breaking news/rumors (Feb 2026) about SCOTUS retirements, illnesses, or Court-reform legislation that could move forecasters.
2. The recent trajectory of the community prediction itself and how it reacted to earlier news—this provides an outside-view baseline on volatility.  
3. Past statistics on how often vacancies occur and how Metaculus questions of this type have behaved, but those are likely already baked into the 26 % baseline and less important for an 8-day forecast.
