Cook* regarding President Trump's attempt to fire Lisa Cook, a Federal Reserve Board of Governors member.\n\n2. **Cook's Appointment History:** Cook was first appointed to the Fed in 2022 and reappointed by President Biden in 2023 to serve a new 14-year term.\n\n3. **Legal Standard:** Under the Federal Reserve Act, Trump can only fire Cook \"for cause\" - a term the law does not define.\n\n4. **Firing Rationale:** In August 2025, Trump fired Cook via Truth Social, alleging she committed mortgage fraud by designating both a Michigan house and an Atlanta condo as her \"primary residence\" when taking out loans within a two-week period. Cook \"unequivocally\" denies these allegations.\n\n5. **Lower Court Actions:** U.S. District Judge Jia Cobb issued an order allowing Cook to stay at the Fed while her challenge continued. A federal appeals court declined to disturb that decision.\n\n6. **Supreme Court Timeline:** On October 1, the Court put the administration's removal request on hold but agreed to hear arguments in January.\n\n7. **Related Cases:** Since Trump took office, the Court has allowed him to remove members of the National Labor Relations Board, Consumer Product Safety Commission, and Merit Systems Protection Board on its interim docket. The Court also heard arguments in December regarding Rebecca Slaughter (FTC member) and is expected to decide by summer.\n\n8. **Arguments Duration:** Oral arguments lasted just under two hours.\n\n9. **Historical Context:** Fed Chair Jerome Powell disclosed earlier this month that he is under investigation by U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro for alleged irregularities in the $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed's headquarters.\n\n## Opinions from Reliable/Named Sources:\n\n**U.S. Solicitor General D. John Sauer (Trump administration):**\n- Argued that deceit or gross negligence by a financial regulator in a financial transaction should be cause for removal\n- Suggested it \"sends the wrong message\" for someone like Cook to be setting interest rates for the American people\n\n**Former U.S. Solicitor General Paul Clement (representing Cook):**\n- Emphasized the Federal Reserve is a \"uniquely structured entity\" with a distinct historical tradition\n- Argued that adopting the administration's view \"would reduce the removal restriction in this unique institution to something that could only be recognized as at-will employment\"\n- Contended there was no reason for Congress to create the Fed as independent only to give it a \"toothless\" removal restriction\n- Argued Cook is entitled to notice, an opportunity to provide evidence, and an opportunity to prevent prejudgment\n\n**Justice Clarence Thomas:**\n- Suggested that if Congress was truly concerned about the Fed's independence, it could have included language requiring notice and a hearing in the removal statute\n\n**Justice Samuel Alito:**\n- Found Clement's \"sliding scale\" approach to procedural requirements \"extraordinarily unhelpful\"\n\n**Justice Brett Kavanaugh:**\n- Asked what the \"fear of more process\" was, suggesting that providing notice and opportunity to present a case would help the executive branch make better decisions and improve public confidence\n\n**Justice Amy Coney Barrett:**\n- Questioned why the administration couldn't have put resources into a hearing instead of litigation to show it had cause to fire Cook\n\n**Chief Justice John Roberts:**\n- Observed that allegations against Cook were \"contradicted by other documents in the record\"\n- Noted that representations about residences would have been made as part of a \"stack of papers you have to fill out\"\n\n**Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson:**\n- Suggested facts still need to be developed, such as when Cook signed the mortgage applications and what she thought she was attesting to\n\n**Justice Sonia Sotomayor:**\n- Suggested there is still a \"factual dispute\" about the allegations against Cook\n\n## Overall Assessment:\n\nThe article's headline and opening indicate that \"a majority of the justices seemed ready to reject the government's request to allow [Trump] to remove [Cook],\" though it was unclear whether they would send the case back to lower courts or rule that Trump doesn't have good reason to fire Cook.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.wandtv.com/news/justice-mary-jane-theis-announces-retirement-from-illinois-supreme-court/article_8257648c-e1b2-49b7-86f6-50bfd463852f.html\">\n# Summary of Article\n\n**Key Facts:**\n- Justice Mary Jane Theis has announced her retirement from the **Illinois Supreme Court** (not the US Supreme Court), effective January 29, 2026\n- Justice Theis served on the Illinois Supreme Court since 2010 and served as Chief Justice from 2022 to 2025\n- First District Appellate Court Justice Sanjay T. Tailor has been appointed to fill Justice Theis' seat, effective January 30, 2026 through December 4, 2028\n- Justice Tailor will be the first Asian American to serve on the Illinois Supreme Court\n\n**Relevance to Forecasting Question:**\nThis article is **not relevant** to the Metaculus question about changes to the **US Supreme Court** composition in 2026.

This likelihood has steadily decreased and is now at its lowest point (40%) except for December 9, when it briefly dropped to 39%\n- **Thomas's age and tenure:** Thomas is the oldest justice on the Court, having served since 1991\n- **Typical retirement age:** In recent decades, justices have typically stepped down in their late 70s to early 80s\n- **Senate composition:** Republicans have a 53-person majority in the Senate, giving them the simple majority needed to confirm a nomination\n- **Current Court makeup:** 6-3 conservative majority, with Trump having nominated three of the eight justices\n- **Three conservative justices are over 70 years old**\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n- **Trump's position:** Trump has stated that Thomas and Justice Samuel Alito are \"fantastic\" and should \"absolutely not\" step down, arguing that criticism is politically motivated\n- **Trump on Ted Cruz:** Trump called Cruz a \"brilliant legal name\" and a \"brilliant man\" who would get 100% of the vote if nominated for the Supreme Court\n- **Thomas's own statements (2019):** Thomas told Pepperdine University president-elect James Gash that he's \"not retiring.\" When asked if he'd retire in 20 or 30 years, he answered no to both. He also told David Rubenstein that same year that he had \"no idea\" where retirement rumors originated\n\n## Context:\n\n- Thomas has faced ethics controversies and scrutiny over his wife's political activism, spurring demands from some Democrats and watchdog groups that he resign\n- Outside pressure, including John Oliver's million-dollar resignation offer, has had little effect on Thomas\n- If Republicans lose control of the Senate in the November midterms, Trump would need to put forward a nominee that Democrats would vote to confirm\n- Cruz, at 55, would represent a multi-decade appointment if nominated\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://mishpacha.com/big-bold-2026-predictions/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Big, Bold 2026 Predictions\" - Mishpacha Magazine\n\n**Publication Details:**\n- Source: Mishpacha Magazine\n- Date: December 23, 2025\n- Author: Cindy Scarr\n\n## Key Predictions Relevant to Supreme Court Composition:\n\n**Supreme Court Retirement Prediction (#3):**\n- The author predicts there will be a Supreme Court retirement in 2026\n- The author believes it is **unlikely to be a liberal justice** due to the risk that President Trump would fill the seat with a conservative\n- **Clarence Thomas will be 78 in 2026** and **Samuel Alito will be 76 in 2026**\n- The author suggests that if these conservative justices calculate that a Democrat may win in 2028, it would give them \"even more reason for them to retire and ensure that their seats are passed to new conservatives\"\n- The author characterizes this as \"just a hunch\"\n\n## Other Predictions in the Article:\n\n1.

Based on Metaculus predictions, the median forecast for AGI is 2033, with a 25% lower bound of 2028 and a 75% upper bound of 2045. Climate tipping points include the West Antarctica Ice Sheet (WAIS) melt, coral reef collapse, Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) collapse, Amazon dieback, and termination shock from geoengineering. The article argues that while WAIS melt and Amazon dieback are slow processes unfolding over decades to centuries, AMOC collapse could begin as early as 2037 (though this is highly speculative), and termination shock\u2014caused by abrupt cessation of stratospheric aerosol injection\u2014could lead to rapid warming and civilizational risk. The author emphasizes that AGI may arrive faster than climate tipping points, which could shift strategic priorities: if AGI emerges early, it may either accelerate climate solutions or exacerbate emissions through economic growth. However, climate disasters could undermine global cooperation and distract from AI safety. The article concludes that both threats must be considered together, urging climate researchers to integrate AI risks into their agendas and the AI community to account for climate instability. The piece is supported by references to IPCC reports, climate modeling, and prediction markets.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 02:36 AM\nSource:[Maya Farber Brodsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kbk8wR2pXtu4R5uFY/will-agi-arrive-before-the-worst-climate-tipping-points)\n\n**Goldman Sachs' Solomon Outlines Three 2026 U.S. Economic and Market Predictions**\nDavid Solomon, CEO of Goldman Sachs, provided three key predictions for the U.S. economy and stock markets in 2026 during an interview at the Goldman Sachs Asia-Pacific Conference, responding to Bloomberg. He stated that the probability of a U.S. recession in 2026 is low, estimating it at approximately 14% (about 1 in 7), and described the current economic environment as 'constructive.' He emphasized that unless an unexpected major event occurs, a recession is unlikely. Solomon forecasts 2026 as a globally 'strong year for capital markets,' driven by potential additional fiscal stimulus measures worldwide, regulatory easing in the U.S. and Europe, and increasing corporate adoption of AI\u2014trends expected to boost productivity, economic growth, and M&A activity. While he acknowledges a risk of a 'potential bubble' in AI-related stocks, he noted that market gains are broadening beyond the 'Magnificent Seven' tech giants, with small-cap stocks beginning to outperform. He observed that more investors are participating, creating a favorable market environment for the next few years. However, Solomon cautioned that temporary disruptions\u2014such as geopolitical shocks or policy changes like the tariffs introduced by former President Donald Trump in April 2025, which caused a historic market plunge\u2014could create short-term noise and erode investor confidence.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 09:00 PM\nSource:[businessinsider.jp](https://www.businessinsider.jp/article/2602-goldman-sachs-stock-market-recession-economic-outlook-david-solomon/)\n\n**Supreme Court growing increasingly 'secretive' as its image continues to plummet**\nThe U.S. Supreme Court has become increasingly secretive, according to a February 2, 2026, New York Times article by Jodi Kantor, which reports that Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. mandated all Court employees to sign a formal nondisclosure agreement (NDA) in November 2024, following President Donald Trump\u2019s re-election. This move, described as unprecedented, transformed long-standing informal norms of silence into legally binding contracts. The change came amid historically low approval ratings for the Court, ranging from 39% to 42% in Gallup polls conducted in 2025. The Court\u2019s 6-3 conservative supermajority, composed of GOP-appointed justices since 2020, has contributed to declining public trust. Former clerks and legal scholars, including Jeffrey L. Fisher of Stanford Law School and University of Florida professor Mark Fenster, interpreted the NDAs as evidence of institutional insecurity and a loss of confidence in informal norms. Fisher stated that justices feel 'under the microscope,' while Fenster called the contracts 'a sign of the Court's own weakness.' The article notes that the sources discussing the NDAs spoke on condition of anonymity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:30 PM\nSource:[Alternet](https://www.alternet.org/scotus-times-john-roberts/)\n\n**PROGNOSIS / Upcoming ECB Governing Council Meetings**\nThe article presents a forecast summary of interest rate predictions from selected financial institutions regarding the upcoming European Central Bank (ECB) meeting on February 5, 2026, and the subsequent three quarters of 2026.

By the end of the first quarter of 2026, 41 institutions forecast 2.00% and 2 predict 1.75%. By the end of the second quarter of 2026, 40 institutions predict 2.00% and 3 predict 1.75%. By the end of the third quarter of 2026, 39 institutions predict 2.00%, 2 predict 1.75%, and 1 predicts 1.50%. The majority of institutions, including ABN Amro, Barclays, Deutsche Bank, Goldman Sachs, and UBS, forecast no change in the rate through all three quarters. A few institutions, such as BofA Global Research, Morgan Stanley, and Standard Chartered, predict a reduction to 1.75% in the first quarter and further to 1.50% by the third quarter.

Key factors and 2026 predictions**\nThe Bank of England (BoE) base rate remains at 3.75%, following four cuts in 2023, and experts predict no immediate further cut in February 2026 due to an unexpected inflation spike two weeks prior, persistently high wage growth, and the approaching 'neutral rate'\u2014estimated at around 3%\u2014which may limit total cuts to just three in this cycle. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC), composed of nine members, is expected to hold the rate steady, with Barclays forecasting a 7-2 split in favor of a hold, reflecting growing caution. RSM UK\u2019s chief economist Thomas Pugh noted that despite a strong economic start to the year and easing labor market conditions, the MPC will likely maintain a cautious stance on timing and number of future cuts. External factors such as geopolitical tensions from Donald Trump\u2019s potential actions, volatile commodity markets, and domestic political uncertainty are adding to forecast uncertainty. While mortgage rates are influenced by forward-looking swap rates, savers are advised to review current offers to maximize returns. Looking ahead to 2026, Deutsche Bank\u2019s Sanjay Raja stated the economy is on a firmer footing than expected, reducing pressure to accelerate cuts. Pugh projects only one cut in April 2026, though a faster-than-expected slowdown in pay growth could prompt further reductions. Market expectations currently range from one to two cuts in 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 10:26 AM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/money/interest-rates-february-inflation-bank-of-england-mpc-b2912063.html)\n\n**U.S. Growth Remains Strong, But Breadth Is Lacking**\nThe U.S. economy is on track for a sixth consecutive year of real GDP growth exceeding 2%, driven primarily by strong consumer spending among high-income households and sustained high investments in the technology sector. However, traditional corporate investments and construction activity show little momentum, while the labor market is losing dynamism. ING upgraded its 2026 U.S. GDP growth forecast from 2.3% to 2.7%, citing stronger-than-expected performance in Q4 2025, despite initial concerns from a temporary government shutdown. The U.S. trade deficit in October was $29 billion\u2014its lowest since 2009\u2014likely due to delayed shipments amid expectations of reduced 'Liberation Day' tariffs, with effects appearing with a lag in data. Even with inventory drawdowns, ING maintains a realistic forecast of nearly 2.5% GDP growth in Q4 2025. A K-shaped recovery persists: the top 20% of households continue robust consumption fueled by high income and rising wealth, while the bottom 60% face increasing pressure due to job insecurity and potential tariff-driven price hikes. Tax relief and higher tax refunds may offer temporary relief, but the timing and scale of the proposed $2,000 'tariff dividend' remain unclear. Corporate investment outside tech has declined for four consecutive quarters, while IT and software spending rose 20% year-on-year. Signs of slowing tech investment are emerging as firms prioritize returns. The construction sector shows similar trends. The labor market has slowed: non-agricultural employment dropped by 173,000 in September due to public sector layoffs, with modest gains in November and December. Jerome Powell\u2019s assessment that job growth was overstated by about 60,000 per month suggests stagnation\u2014few new hires and few layoffs. Inflation data released late due to the shutdown show no immediate price surge from tariffs, though future increases remain possible pending Supreme Court rulings. Companies may delay price hikes until legal clarity. Falling energy costs, moderating rent increases, and weaker wage growth are helping reduce inflationary pressures, bringing inflation closer to the 2% target. Given this outlook and cautious labor market dynamics, ING expects the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates twice in 2026, with the first cut likely in Q2, not March as previously anticipated.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 06:12 AM\nSource:[Investing.com Deutsch](https://de.investing.com/analysis/uswachstum-bleibt-stark-doch-die-breite-fehlt-200505740)\n\n**Pilar Cisneros Concedes It's 'Very Difficult' to Achieve 40 Legislative Seats**\nPilar Cisneros acknowledged that securing 40 of the 57 legislative seats is 'very difficult,' emphasizing that such a result would require an overwhelming electoral victory. She cited the complexity of the electoral system\u2014based on quotients, subquotients, and residues\u2014as a major challenge in predicting seat allocation accurately. Cisneros noted that a party could win a seat through a subquotient with as few as 25 or even 1 vote via a residue, highlighting the unpredictability of the system. Despite this, she expressed confidence that the ruling coalition would gain a larger fraction than its current representation, which has dropped from 10 to 8 legislators due to the departure of Mar\u00eda Marta Padilla (who became independent) and Luz Mary Alp\u00edzar (leader of the PPSD, who maintains political differences and is excluded from official meetings). The election also determined the composition of the Legislative Assembly for the 2026\u20132030 term.

According to the data, India is projected to contribute 17% to global real GDP growth in 2026, surpassing the United States, which is forecasted at 9.9%. India and China together are expected to account for 43.6% of global growth. The IMF projects global growth at 3.3% in 2026 and 3.2% in 2027, slightly higher than its October 2025 forecast, driven by strong technology investment, fiscal and monetary support, and private sector resilience. The improved outlook comes amid heightened global economic uncertainty and trade tensions, including US tariff measures under President Donald Trump targeting China and India. India\u2019s growth forecast for 2025 was revised upward by 0.7 percentage points to 7.3%, with projections moderating to 6.4% in 2026 and 2027. Inflation trends vary: China\u2019s inflation is expected to rise gradually from low levels, while India\u2019s inflation is projected to approach target levels after a sharp decline in 2025, largely due to softer food prices. The IMF warned of downside risks, including reassessments of technology-led growth and escalating geopolitical tensions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 02:39 PM\nSource:[News18](https://www.news18.com/world/balance-of-power-changing-elon-musk-after-imf-data-shows-india-above-us-in-global-gdp-growth-9872570.html)\n\n**JUST NOW Supreme Court 6 3 Emergency Ruling Shakes the Nation A Sudden Change Affecting Millions!**\nThe U.S. Supreme Court issued a 6-3 emergency ruling on February 1, 2026, that effectively ends the ability of federal district judges to issue nationwide injunctions blocking executive actions, laws, or policies across the entire country. The majority opinion, authored by Justice Amy Coney Barrett and joined by Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Alito, Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, and Thomas, argues that such injunctions exceed the historical scope of judicial authority under the Judiciary Act of 1789, improperly protect non-parties, and encourage forum shopping. Justice Gorsuch concurred, emphasizing historical precedent against such injunctions, while Justice Thomas criticized them as a modern judicial invention. In dissent, Justices Sotomayor and the liberal justices warned that the decision allows potentially unconstitutional policies to take effect during prolonged litigation, effectively making constitutional rights dependent on state-by-state enforcement. The ruling could invalidate or disrupt approximately 68 existing nationwide injunctions affecting immigration, healthcare, environmental regulations, election policies, and more, leading to patchwork enforcement across different regions and circuits. The decision increases litigation burdens and costs for states, businesses, and advocacy groups such as the ACLU and NAACP, and raises concerns about legal chaos ahead of the 2026 election cycle. States including Texas, Florida, California, and New York have already filed emergency motions in response. The ruling was reported by Donald J. Trump.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 12:48 PM\nSource:[Donald J.

He attributed this projected support to the alliance's achievements, including the liberation of Karabakh from Armenia and its transfer to Azerbaijan, the implementation of the Mavi Vatan (Blue Homeland) agreement to safeguard national rights, and the eradication of terrorism from Turkey, Syria, and Iraq. Adan emphasized that the alliance's success in maintaining national unity and democracy has earned the people's loyalty. He highlighted Perpa, a historic marketplace in Istanbul, as a symbol of economic vitality and national resilience, noting its thousands of businesses, workers, and daily visitors. Referring to MHP General Chairman Devlet Bah\u00e7eli\u2019s 2023 prediction that 'everything will change, but hopefully Turkey will not change,' Adan affirmed that Turkey continues to advance with confidence despite global chaos. He dismissed early election calls from the opposition, arguing that such a move would not solve Turkey\u2019s problems and that the current presidential system under President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, in coordination with Bah\u00e7eli\u2019s leadership, is effectively addressing national challenges through unity and perseverance.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 10:49 AM\nSource:[Yeni Akit Gazetesi](https://www.yeniakit.com.tr/haber/bugun-secim-olsa-mhpli-adan-cumhur-ittifakinin-oy-oranini-verdi-1980397.html)\n\n**It Won't Be Boring: 7 Predictions for the Legal Industry in 2026**\nThe article presents seven predictions for the legal industry in 2026, authored by a legal journalist with expertise in Big Law and the U.S. federal courts. First, the Trump administration\u2019s executive orders targeting large law firms are likely over, having achieved their goal of intimidating Big Law. Second, the DC Circuit will likely uphold lower court rulings and strike down the executive orders, with judges across the ideological spectrum finding them unconstitutional. Third, the Supreme Court will probably decline to hear any of these cases due to lack of a circuit split and settled constitutional precedent. Fourth, the Supreme Court will increasingly rule against the Trump administration in merits cases involving tariffs, birthright citizenship, and the removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, despite the administration\u2019s strong record on the emergency docket. Fifth, no Supreme Court justices are expected to retire in 2026, as Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito remain active and healthy, with Thomas especially influential in the current conservative majority. Sixth, Kirkland & Ellis and Wachtell Lipton are projected to become the first firms to surpass $10 million in profits per equity partner (PPEP) in 2025, driven by record M&A deal volumes\u2014Kirkland advised on $743 billion in deals, Wachtell on $621 billion, compared to $427 billion and $228 billion in 2024. Seventh, Wachtell Lipton is expected to reclaim its #1 ranking in PPEP from Kirkland in the 2026 rankings, despite Kirkland\u2019s higher deal value, due to Wachtell\u2019s smaller equity partner base and Kirkland\u2019s costly litigation hiring spree that may reduce short-term profitability. The author concludes that 2026 will be a dynamic year for legal news and predicts it 'won\u2019t be boring.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 09:57 AM\nSource:[news.bloomberglaw.com](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/legal-exchange-insights-and-commentary/it-wont-be-boring-7-predictions-for-the-legal-industry-in-2026)\n\n**Ronald Brownstein: The Supreme Court could give the GOP a political lifeline**\nRonald Brownstein argues that the Supreme Court's upcoming decision on the Voting Rights Act (VRA) could provide a critical political lifeline for the Republican Party in defending its narrow five-seat majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections. Currently, Republicans face significant challenges, including historical trends showing no party has maintained unified control of the White House, House, and Senate through a midterm since 1978, combined with declining approval ratings for former President Donald Trump and strong Democratic performance in the 2025 elections. Efforts by red states to redraw congressional districts have yielded only a minimal net gain due to GOP reluctance in states like Indiana and Democratic counteractions such as California\u2019s redistricting. However, the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority appears poised to significantly limit or overturn the 1965 VRA provision that prohibits election law changes with discriminatory effects on racial minorities. If the court weakens this provision, Republican-controlled Southern states\u2014including Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, and possibly Texas\u2014could redraw district lines to eliminate seats currently held by Black and Latino Democrats. Analysts estimate this could shift at least seven to eight additional House seats to the GOP, with long-term implications extending to state legislative and local elections. The potential elimination of up to 140 Democratic state legislative seats held by people of color\u2014about 40% of the current total\u2014highlights the broad impact. The decision, expected by June but possibly released within six to eight weeks, could allow states time to act before the 2026 election. The Court\u2019s historical pattern under Chief Justice John Roberts\u2014rolling back federal voting regulations and restricting race-conscious remedies\u2014supports the expectation of a conservative ruling. The outcome could entrench Republican dominance in Southern states, despite population growth driven by non-White residents, effectively disenfranchising communities of color. This scenario echoes the Constitution\u2019s three-fifths compromise, raising concerns about a constitutional irony: counting non-White populations for representation while denying them meaningful political voice. The long-term impact would likely not be fully felt until after the 2030 Census, when Republican-controlled states could draw maps with minimal legal constraints, potentially reducing Black and Latino representation for decades. According to Manuel Pastor of the Equity Research Institute, this reflects a GOP strategy to align current demographics with a nostalgic vision of a past America. Brownstein notes that while non-White Republicans have slightly increased in number, they still represent only about 10% of GOP House members, suggesting that any shift in seat design would likely result in more White Republican representation.

Key predictions include: a 75% chance that Donald Trump will lose a Supreme Court challenge on reciprocal tariffs, with a likely 6-3 or 7-2 ruling and a 60% chance of partial refunds; a 90% chance Trump will lose on birthright citizenship, possibly by a 9-0 vote; an 80% chance he will lose on firing Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, with a 6-3 decision expected. AI is predicted to have minimal impact in 2026, with only moderate job losses and no major bankruptcies\u2014rated 75% likely. Tariffs are expected to hurt businesses, leading to job losses and rising small business bankruptcies, with Trump blaming Biden, the Fed, and the Supreme Court\u2014rated 80% probable. Republicans are predicted to lose the House in the midterms due to voter skepticism about the economy, with low turnout among non-MAGA Republicans\u201475% chance. Trump may broker a peace deal between Russia and Ukraine, rated 60% likely. Health care inflation is projected to add 1.5 to 2 percentage points to the PCE, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation measure, making rate cuts difficult\u201470% chance. A recession is forecast with 55% probability, characterized as long and shallow rather than short and deep, driven by tariff and deportation-related economic damage. The unemployment rate is expected to rise to 5.5%, rated 70% likely, with demographic factors like retiring baby boomers limiting the increase. The author notes the economy is currently K-shaped, propped up by AI and health care spending among the wealthy, with consumer spending dependent on stock market performance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 01, 2026 05:15 PM\nSource:[TalkMarkets - Economics & Politics](https://talkmarkets.com/content/economics--politics/fearless-predictions-ten-key-events-to-expect-in-2026?post=547782)\n\n**Vox staff predictions for 2026: What to expect next year**\nVox's Future Perfect team and contributing experts released their 2026 predictions, each accompanied by a probability estimate, emphasizing epistemic honesty. Key forecasts include: the U.S. likely transitioning from a liberal to an electoral democracy under Trump\u2019s second presidency, with a low-confidence prediction (V-DEM rating shift); Democrats expected to retake the House in the 2026 midterms (high confidence), though Senate gains remain uncertain; the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education is unlikely to be completed, with at least one function surviving due to Republican concerns; the Supreme Court may rule that Trump exceeded authority under the IEEPA in imposing tariffs, with a 70% probability; Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito is likely to retire before the end of 2026, given the risk of a Democratic-controlled Senate post-2026; Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is expected to lose the 2026 election, despite coalition management, due to widespread public fatigue; the war in Ukraine is projected to continue into a fifth year, with no imminent ceasefire; a military conflict over Taiwan remains unlikely in 2026, though economic pressure and gray-zone tactics are expected; housing reform will expand in 2026, with more states passing zoning laws allowing duplexes and multi-unit housing, though a 50% threshold for single-family zoning elimination is unlikely; billionaire wealth is projected to exceed $17 trillion by 2026, driven by AI and inheritance; a U.S. recession in 2026 is slightly more likely than not (55% probability); cage-free eggs will not reach 50% of the U.S. supply by September 2026, despite momentum from 2025 state laws; at least one more U.S. state will ban lab-grown meat in 2026; avian flu vaccination in poultry is unlikely to be authorized nationally by 2026 due to trade and regulatory hurdles; data center construction will face growing resistance and supply constraints, limiting rapid expansion; and a Category 5 hurricane is expected to make landfall in the U.S. in 2026, given La Ni\u00f1a conditions and record Atlantic Ocean heat, though the baseline odds remain low.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 01, 2026 11:00 AM\nSource:[Vox](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/473166/forecasts-2026-trump-congress-democrats-musk-artificial-intelligence-hurricanes)\n\n**Predictions for 2026 (and some commentary)**\nThe article presents a series of speculative predictions for 2026, explicitly disclaiming any use for investment or gambling. It forecasts the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing above 50,000, oil prices below $60 per barrel, and inflation averaging 3% in 2026. GDP growth is projected at 4% for 2026, up from an estimated 3% annualized in 2025. A federal government funding interruption (shutdown) is expected in February 2026, during which Republicans are predicted to concede on Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, despite the author's view that the program has become a financial burden on taxpayers. The federal deficit is expected to remain at approximately $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2026, consistent with prior years. Electricity prices are expected to rise due to stagnant generating capacity (nuclear, coal, and natural gas) despite growing demand, necessitating rapid construction of new natural gas plants. The utility model faces increasing political pressure, but data centers will still secure power. The Republican caucus in the House is expected to fall below 218 members in 2026, with growing retirements. Republicans are predicted to retain control of the House by a narrow margin, though redistricting efforts will be invalidated by the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of majority-minority districts, affecting Republican-controlled states. Economic growth and Democratic primary momentum are expected to hinder Democratic electoral success. In sports, Notre Dame is predicted to win the college football championship, the Buffalo Bills to win the Super Bowl, and the Phillies to win the World Series in 2026. The Washington football team is expected to revert to the Redskins name. AI dominated 2025, with robotics expected to be the key trend in 2026. China\u2019s attempts to pressure Taiwan and its allies are expected to fail, strengthening the Quad alliance (U.S., Australia, Japan, India).

Key predictions include: Clarence Thomas will retire before the 2026 midterms despite no immediate electoral urgency; redistricting will not determine the outcome of the midterms due to GOP overreach in Indiana and Trump's unpopularity with independents; thermostatic backlash politics will return, leading to a Democratic 'Blue Wave' in the midterms, with Democrats winning the House and potentially endangering the Republican Senate majority; Donald Trump remains deeply unpopular with independent voters, and no major events are expected to shift voter sentiment; the Supreme Court will gut Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in Louisiana v. Callais, enabling Southern states to redraw districts to weaken the Congressional Black Caucus, though this will likely not affect the 2026 outcome; the Court will rule against Trump on tariffs, delivering a stinging defeat; it will grant Trump a partial victory on birthright citizenship; mass deportations will be pursued as a political strategy to energize the base, despite a gridlocked Congress; Democrats are expected to retake the House, possibly due to retirements, though Senate gains are unlikely; Vivek Ramaswamy will lose the Ohio gubernatorial race due to lack of appeal among independents and Trump voters, and a weak campaign; Republican infighting will intensify post-Trump, with establishment forces attempting to reclaim the party; remnants of the Alt-Right will coalesce under Ben Shapiro\u2019s leadership, forming a conservative fundamentalist movement; race realism and the 'Jewish Question' will gain traction, especially among younger conservatives; Israel is predicted to return to war in Gaza, Lebanon, or against Iran, though the U.S. will not join; political violence will persist, with a major act\u2014assassination, bombing, or riot\u2014expected in 2026; and ultimately, MAGA will fail, with Trump unable to 'Make America Great Again,' marking 2026 as a year of backlash and mixed Supreme Court outcomes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 20, 2025 05:34 PM\nSource:[Occidental Dissent](https://occidentaldissent.com/2025/12/20/2026-predictions/)\n\n**U.S. Democracy Threat Index: $10,000 in Forecasting Prizes  --  LessWrong**\nA federal judge found probable cause that the Trump administration willfully defied a court order regarding deportation flights to El Salvador, intensifying a contempt probe that now seeks whistleblower and DOJ testimony on who authorized the flights and how the government responded. This case, along with related issues involving contempt referrals, DOJ follow-through, and the treatment of individuals sent to foreign prisons, is included in Metaculus's U.S. Democracy Threat Index\u2014a forecasting initiative developed with Bright Line Watch, a nonpartisan group of political scientists from Dartmouth and other institutions. The index tracks 39 observable indicators across six areas: electoral integrity, political rights, civil liberties, rule of law, institutional checks and balances, and information integrity. Each question forecasts whether a specific event will occur within a two-year window, with historical data backfilled for 2021\u20132024 to establish base rates. Current forecasting periods are 2025\u201326 and 2027\u201328. The index value is the average probability across all 39 questions, where higher values indicate greater predicted threat to democratic institutions and lower values indicate greater resilience. The index dynamically updates as new information emerges and forecasts are revised, offering real-time signal on institutional health. A $10,000 prize pool has been introduced to incentivize accurate predictions: $7,500 will be awarded based on forecast accuracy from December 12, 2025 onward, and $2,500 will be awarded based on periodic snapshots aligned with Bright Line Watch\u2019s surveys of political scientists and the American public. The first snapshot is scheduled for January 1, 2026, requiring forecasts to be submitted before that date.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 12, 2025 07:43 PM\nSource:[Maya Farber Brodsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Lmwhzi3cRdSEg6ZDe/u-s-democracy-threat-index-usd10-000-in-forecasting-prizes)\n\n**How AI Outperforms Humans in Forecasting the Future**\nMetaculus, a prediction platform, runs quarterly contests where participants use AI to forecast geopolitical events, offering about $5,000 to winners. The platform poses questions such as 'Will Thailand experience a military coup before September\u202f2025?' and 'Will Israel strike the Iranian army again before September\u202f2025?'. Experts estimate probabilities, providing more nuanced answers than simple yes/no. Weeks or months before events, predictions often show notable accuracy: users correctly predicted the Russian invasion of Ukraine two weeks early and assigned a 90\u202f% probability to the cancellation of the U.S. Supreme Court case Roe v.\u202fWade roughly two months before it occurred. When the contest began in June, participants expected AI to outperform humans by 40\u202f% on average, but Metaculus AI achieved over 80\u202f%. Prediction experts update forecasts based on legislators\u2019 policies to anticipate how hypothetical political interventions might affect outcomes, enabling them to advise decision\u2011makers on 'changing the status quo'. However, forecasting broad geopolitical issues remains extremely difficult, with top experts spending days and tens of thousands of dollars on a single question. Rand Corporation estimates that human experts would need months to produce initial forecasts for all questions, let alone update them regularly. AI excels in data\u2011rich domains like weather or quantitative finance, but geopolitical forecasting involves many interdependent factors that humans can sometimes predict more cheaply. Large language models use the same complex information as human forecasters and can simulate human judgment. They improve by predicting many questions, observing performance, and updating methods based on results, at a scale far beyond human capacity. Moreover, machines have an unfair advantage: participants earn points not only for accuracy but also for 'coverage'\u2014the breadth of predictions, the number of questions answered, and the frequency of updates. Even less accurate AI can rank highly by continuously updating estimates in response to emerging news, a feat impossible for humans. The biggest remaining challenge for AI is producing high\u2011quality predictions for all required questions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 11:47 AM\nSource:[elnabaa.net](https://www.elnabaa.net/1136072/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%81%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A4-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
