Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological order, all dates in the past)

1. Billboard (Nov 20 2025) – reports Billboard withheld an AI song (“I Run”) from the Hot 100 despite enough chart points.  High-quality trade source; facts: a policy-driven block occurred.  Opinions: author’s view that Billboard has a “philosophical stance”.

2. Billboard (Nov 1 2025 & follow-ups) – Xania Monet, fully AI act, reached No. 30 Adult R&B Airplay, No. 1 R&B Digital Song Sales.  High-quality; shows AI music can penetrate Billboard brand charts.

3. ABC News (Oct 2025) – AI country song “Walk My Walk” hit No. 1 Country Digital Song Sales.  National media; corroborates growing AI presence.

4. Billboard (Nov 13 2025) – Nashville executives’ backlash to AI acts.  Same trade source; high quality; indicates industry resistance.

5. djrobblog.com (Nov 2025) – repeats policy-block story; medium quality blog; largely consistent with Billboard.

6. Billboard Canada (Jan 30 2026) – Spotify removes AI-like uploads; shows enforcement tightening.  High quality.

7. Asknews meta articles (Feb 2026) – none speak directly to Billboard Hot 100 or Metaculus; ignored for resolution.

8. Research pieces (Rethink Priorities 2021; EA Forum 2023) – quantitative studies: Metaculus AI questions skew mildly progress-optimistic.  Good methodology; but older.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to threshold “Metaculus community > 46 %” on 12 Feb 2026)

Strong:
• Metaculus tendency: community mid-range clustering (40-60 %) & slight optimism on AI-progress (RP 2021; EA 2023).  Structural feature of platform.

Moderate:
• Multiple credible reports of AI songs charting on several Billboard component charts → keeps forecasters from going far sub-50 %.
• Industry gate-keeping (Billboard block, label/legal frictions) – repeated by two independent Billboard articles – logical downward pressure.

Weak:
• TikTok virality anecdotes; could change quickly but rarely convert to Top-20 Hot 100 without label push within one week.

Net pull: upward forces (platform bias + recent successes) slightly outweigh downward (policy risk).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon = 9 days (3 Feb → 12 Feb 2026).  Community predictions are usually sticky over such a short window; typical one-week σ ≈ 3 pp except after large news.  If horizon were doubled (18 days) I’d widen volatility band and drop probability ~4 pp; halved (4–5 days) I’d raise by ~2 pp.

(d) Justification / inside-view update  
Unknown current Metaculus value is the main uncertainty.  Prior distribution over “current probability” (P₀):

• 70 % on P₀ > 46 % (centered near 48–52) – supported by mid-range clustering and mild optimism.  
• 30 % on P₀ ≤ 46 %.

Conditional dynamics (9 days):
• If P₀ > 46 %, 80 % chance it stays > 46 % (small drift / no blockbuster news expected).  
• If P₀ ≤ 46 %, 25 % chance it drifts above (random walk + small good-news chance).  

Combined: 0.7 × 0.8 + 0.3 × 0.25 ≈ 0.64 → 64 %.

I therefore shift the outside-view baseline (56 %) upward by +8 pp to incorporate (i) platform-bias evidence and (ii) short-horizon stickiness, moderated by legal-friction evidence.

Probability calibration

Best single-number forecast for “community prediction > 46 % at 05:12 UTC on 12 Feb 2026” = 64 %.  90 % CI for true answer (if we re-ran the world many times) roughly 45 %–80 %.

Checklist:

1. Restated criterion: At the timestamp 12 Feb 2026 05:12 UTC, Metaculus community probability must exceed 46 % for “AI song Top-20 Hot 100 before 2027”.  
2. Outside-view base: 56 %.  
3. Consistency: “In 64 of 100 worlds, the Metaculus number ends up > 46 %.”  Sounds reasonable.  
4. Key evidence:  
   a) Metaculus mid-range clustering + mild AI optimism.  
   b) AI songs already topping Billboard component charts.  
   c) Billboard’s policy block shows real friction.  
   d) Only nine-day window → forecasts usually stable.  
5. Blind spot: A surprise Billboard rule explicitly banning AI from Hot 100 announced this week could crash probability below 30 %.  
6. Status-quo bias: Short window, no major scheduled music-industry events → drift likely modest.

Probability: 64%
