Analysis:
The Metaculus community prediction was exactly 46 % on 2026-02-01. Between now (2026-02-03) and the evaluation date (2026-02-12) the probability could rise if either of the following happens or is anticipated:
• A believable rumour or confirmed plan of a forthcoming AI-generated single from a major label or superstar artist is reported.  
• A song already considered AI-created shows strong real-time streaming/airplay gains, making a Hot 100 top-20 entry within the next few weeks plausible.  
• Industry or Billboard policy news lowers perceived barriers for AI songs (e.g., clearer crediting rules, no exclusion).  
Conversely, the probability could fall if Billboard issues restrictive guidance, a highly-publicised AI release underperforms, or expert commentary highlights technical/label hurdles.

Therefore, the most relevant current information will come from:
1. Music-industry and tech press covering newly released or announced AI songs, their streaming numbers, and label promotions.  
2. Billboard chart analysis blogs and social-media trackers that discuss songs bubbling under the top 20.  
3. News about policy statements or legal developments that might affect AI music eligibility.  
4. Discussion on forecasting or tech platforms (Metaculus blog, LessWrong, etc.) that might shift forecasters’ sentiment.

The three searches below should surface these kinds of articles.
