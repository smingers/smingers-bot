Question background:

As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency.

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40969
- Original question title: Will an AI-created song chart in the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 before 2027?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-01: 46.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as **Yes** if a song largely created by AI lists in the top 20 on any weekly [Billboard Hot 100](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/) chart released before January 1, 2027.

Original fine print: 
> * According to the current schedule, the chart for the week of January 2, 2027 will be released on December 29, 2026 and therefore is included in this question. If the release schedule changes, the final week whose results are fully encompassed within 2026 will be the final one included.&#x20;
> * This question will use credible sources or artist credits to determine whether a song is largely created by AI.
> * For the purpose of this question, a song will be considered as largely created by AI if either of the following is true:
>   * The vocal melody is composed and performed by an AI. This does not include voice conversion, in which an AI changes the style/voice of an existing recording.
>   * The lead melodic instrument as well as the majority of the instruments are composed and generated by an AI. Minor edits or AI-generated accompaniment alone will not qualify.
> * Whether a song's lyrics are written by a human or AI will have no impact on this question.
> * If Metaculus assesses that AI songs have been explicitly prohibited from appearing in the Hot 100 list in a manner that would significantly impact the resolution of this question, this question will be **annulled**.

Original background: 
> During 2025, AI created songs have began to place on various [Billboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_\(magazine\)) charts, with at least six songs landing in the charts within the year. As of late 2025, this trend is accelerating leading to speculation an AI created song may soon chart on the Billboard Hot 100.
> 
> [How Many AI Artists Have Debuted on Billboard’s Charts?:](https://www.billboard.com/lists/ai-artists-on-billboard-charts/childpets-galore/)
> 
> > Notably, at least one AI artist has debuted in each of the past five chart weeks, a streak suggesting this trend is quickly accelerating.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40969) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-12 05:12:06 is higher than 46.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 46.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-12 05:12:06, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-03 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write a series of search queries that will be used by your assistant to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether you wish to utilize google, google news or the agent to retrieve information.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model equipped with capable web crawlers and designed to generate lengthy, detailed responses. As such, you may use a longer query with detailed instructions. It is possible to ask multiple questions.
Nonetheless, you are advised to keep your query to at most four sentences.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () **on the same line as and after** the query. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for Agent.
