Based on Metaculus predictions, the median forecast for AGI is 2033, with a 25% lower bound of 2028 and a 75% upper bound of 2045. Climate tipping points include the West Antarctica Ice Sheet (WAIS) melt, coral reef collapse, Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) collapse, Amazon dieback, and termination shock from geoengineering. The article argues that while WAIS melt and Amazon dieback are slow processes unfolding over decades to centuries, AMOC collapse could begin as early as 2037 (though this is highly speculative), and termination shock\u2014caused by abrupt cessation of stratospheric aerosol injection\u2014could lead to rapid warming and civilizational risk. The author emphasizes that AGI may arrive faster than climate tipping points, which could shift strategic priorities: if AGI emerges early, it may either accelerate climate solutions or exacerbate emissions through economic growth. However, climate disasters could undermine global cooperation and distract from AI safety. The article concludes that both threats must be considered together, urging climate researchers to integrate AI risks into their agendas and the AI community to account for climate instability. The piece is supported by references to IPCC reports, climate modeling, and prediction markets.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 02:36 AM\nSource:[Maya Farber Brodsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Kbk8wR2pXtu4R5uFY/will-agi-arrive-before-the-worst-climate-tipping-points)\n\n**AI Predicted Who Made the 2026 Super Bowl. Can It Pick the Winner?**\nOn February 2, 2026, four AI chatbots\u2014ChatGPT, Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, and Claude\u2014were used to predict outcomes for the 2026 Super Bowl (Super Bowl LX). All four correctly predicted that the Seattle Seahawks and New England Patriots would face off in the championship game. They unanimously forecasted a Seahawks victory by a margin of 27 points, with final scores of either 27-23 or 27-24. The AI systems also agreed on the coin toss outcome: three predicted the Seahawks would win the toss, choose tails, and defer to the Patriots; Gemini predicted the Patriots would win the toss. All four systems predicted Bad Bunny would headline the halftime show, with cameos from Cardi B and J Balvin, and listed specific songs including 'Tit\u00ed Me Pregunt\u00f3', 'Me Porto Bonito', 'I Like It', 'D\u00e1kiti', 'Baile Inolvidable', 'El Apag\u00f3n', 'NuevaYol', and 'Yo Perreo Sola'. Predictions for the national anthem were consistent at approximately 2 minutes, with viewership estimates ranging from 118 million to 130 million. Regarding the most expensive ad, predictions varied: Claude predicted an AI company would spend $8.5 million per 30 seconds; Gemini predicted Anheuser-Busch would spend 2.5 minutes of airtime; ChatGPT and Copilot predicted Apple would spend $14\u201316 million on a 60-second ad. Betting totals were highly divergent, with Claude predicting $9.2 billion and Gemini forecasting $25 billion in legal bets, while ChatGPT and Copilot estimated between $2.5 billion and $6 billion. The Madden NFL video game also predicted a Seahawks win, though with a 23-20 score. The article notes that AI systems are not infallible and that predictions should be treated as speculative.\nOriginal language: unknown\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 09:41 PM\nSource:[cnet.com](https://www.cnet.com/tech/services-and-software/i-tried-using-ai-to-predict-the-2026-super-bowl/)\n\n**Billboard Hot 100 Top 10 Countdown For February 7th, 2026 | Billboard News**\nOn the Billboard Hot 100 chart dated February 7, 2026, Harry Styles' song 'Aperture' debuts at No. 1, marking a strong return to the top spot. Ella Langley's 'Choosin' Texas' reaches a new peak, climbing higher than its previous position. Bruno Mars' 'I Just Might' drops to No. 6, remaining a strong contender for the top position. Other songs in the top 10 include 'Opalite' at No. 10, 'Folded' at No. 9, 'Sombr' at No. 8, 'Ordinary' at No. 7, Taylor's track at No. 5, 'Golden' at No. 4, and 'Man I Need' at No. 3.

For the Kuaile 8 draw on February 1, 2026 (Issue 2026033), the AI model suggests focusing on gold number 26, silver number 28, bronze number 39, and key numbers 02, 26, 44, 62, 70. For Double Color Ball, red balls 13, 19, 32 are highlighted as hot numbers in the high-number zone, while blue balls 01 and 10 are considered active. The analysis relies on patterns such as repeating numbers (e.g., 22, 26, 43 in Kuaile 8), hot/cold number tracking (e.g., 02, 26 as hot; 05, 18 as cold), number range distribution (e.g., red balls 20\u201333 frequently drawn), and consecutive number sequences (e.g., 26\u201328). However, the article stresses that lottery draws are entirely random, and historical patterns do not predict future outcomes. It warns against common misconceptions like the 'gambler's fallacy'\u2014the belief that hot numbers will continue to appear or cold numbers must 'return'\u2014and cautions against trusting overly complex or 'AI-powered' prediction systems, which may be designed for profit or traffic generation. The recommended mindset is to treat lottery playing as entertainment, not a strategy, and to engage in responsible, rational betting.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 08:36 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_7879995911_1d5af320706801f3pg.html)\n\n**Is AI Lottery Prediction Reliable? AI Analysis of Happy 8 and Seven\u4e50\u5f69 Data for February 2, 2026**\nThe article discusses AI-based lottery predictions for the Chinese games 'Happy 8' and 'Seven\u4e50\u5f69' on February 2, 2026. According to the analysis, AI does not predict future outcomes but instead uses machine learning to analyze historical data, identifying short-term statistical patterns such as 'hot numbers' (frequently drawn numbers) and 'repeat numbers' (numbers appearing in consecutive draws). For Happy 8, the AI identified hot numbers including 02, 08, 58, 59, 62, and 76, with number 02 appearing 4 times in the last 5 draws, indicating high short-term frequency. For Seven\u4e50\u5f69, the analysis suggests active head and tail numbers. The report explicitly states that all predictions are based on past probability statistics and cannot guarantee future results, emphasizing that lottery games remain fundamentally random. The article advises players to view AI predictions as a fun, supplementary tool rather than a reliable strategy, urging rational play and responsible gambling.

The author observes that AI now exhibits sudden, unexpected skill emergence and behavioral shifts from minor adjustments, while certain problems remain stubbornly unresolved. This erratic progress undermines traditional forecasting models that relied on consistent benchmark improvements and predictable scaling. The article highlights societal concerns about AI's influence on trust, mental health (referencing 'chat psychosis'), electricity consumption, and children's access, all of which reflect broader unease about what lies ahead. Despite AI\u2019s increasing impact on work, learning, and cognition, the lack of a stable trajectory makes long-term predictions increasingly unreliable. The piece concludes that the era of predictable AI development has ended, rendering forecasts more speculative than ever.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 06:59 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@jyostnavya.jakkapu/why-are-ai-predictions-so-hard-in-2026-e15a46200276)\n\n**Meta's Mark Zuckerberg Just Predicted What's Next for AI (And It's Excellent News for Nvidia)**\nMark Zuckerberg, CEO of Meta (NASDAQ: META), predicted during the company's earnings call on February 1, 2026, that 2026 will be a 'big year' for AI infrastructure and a period of major AI acceleration across multiple fronts. This forecast signals continued strong demand for artificial intelligence hardware, particularly Nvidia's (NASDAQ: NVDA) graphics processing units (GPUs), which are essential for both training AI models and running them in real-world applications. Meta's recent quarterly revenue rose 24% year over year to $59 billion, driven by advertising on platforms like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp, and Messenger. The company is heavily investing in AI to enhance user engagement and transform advertising, with long-term potential for new revenue streams. Zuckerberg\u2019s forward-looking statement reinforces the expectation that AI infrastructure spending will surge in 2026, supporting Nvidia\u2019s ongoing growth trajectory. Nvidia has already seen its stock rise 1,300% over five years and continues to benefit from sustained demand from major AI players like Meta. The company\u2019s upcoming Rubin platform update, expected later in 2026, is viewed as an additional catalyst for revenue growth. Although the Motley Fool\u2019s Stock Advisor did not include Nvidia in its latest top 10 stock recommendations, the article suggests that Nvidia remains a strong long-term investment opportunity due to the enduring AI boom.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 12:05 AM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/metas-mark-zuckerberg-just-predicted-whats-next-ai-and-its-excellent-news-nvidia)\n\n**Artificial Intelligence is Redefining the Boundaries of Technology and Art**\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is redefining the boundaries between technology and art, as highlighted in a recent article from Sina Finance. The piece outlines several pivotal moments in 2025 where AI reshaped American popular culture. In the film 'Beast Mode,' released in early 2025, actor Adrien Brody won the Academy Award for Best Actor, but controversy erupted when it was revealed that AI was used to enhance his accent to sound more authentically Hungarian\u2014raising debates over authenticity versus technological enhancement. The Academy stated that such digital tools neither add nor subtract from nominations. Film scholar Holly Willis from the University of Southern California argued that film has always been an art of 'fabrication,' from lighting to sound mixing, making AI a natural evolution. In music, the AI-generated band VelvetSundown achieved over one million Spotify streams within weeks, with all creative aspects\u2014including composition, vocals, and virtual personas\u2014produced by AI, sparking debates over legitimacy. Spotify later considered labeling AI-generated content. AI also topped the Billboard Country Digital Song Sales chart with 'WalkMyWalk' and placed a virtual gospel singer, Solomon Ray, in the iTunes Top 100. Legendary producer Timbaland introduced his AI prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Tatta Takumi, calling it a 'new direction for art.' In August 2025, Google AI transformed the classic film 'The Wizard of Oz' into an immersive 80-million-dollar Sphere experience in Las Vegas, with characters appearing in 3D around the audience. Professor Dominic Willis of the University of Reading called it not restoration but adaptation. Meanwhile, AI 'digital avatars' are increasingly used in podcasting to record, translate, and interact in real time, though some argue this erodes the intimacy of human connection. In September 2025, digital actress Tilly Noordwijk debuted\u2014created by Dutch artist Irene van der Velden using AI trained on real actors\u2019 performances without consent or compensation\u2014raising ethical concerns about authorship and representation. In December 2025, Disney announced a $1 billion investment in OpenAI and authorized its classic characters to appear on Sora, reversing its earlier lawsuit against Midjourney over unauthorized image replication. The article concludes that AI is now an inseparable part of culture\u2014both collaborator and challenger\u2014forcing society to confront fundamental questions about the nature of art and creativity, with the answer lying not in technology itself, but in how humans choose to use it.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 08:01 PM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/jjxw/2026-02-02/doc-inhkkeer4529594.shtml)\n\n**AI Music Companies Setting the Direction for 2026**\nArtificial intelligence is now a central force in the music industry, according to a recent Billboard industry list highlighting companies shaping the future of music creation, licensing, and distribution. Suno enables users to generate complete songs\u2014including vocals and instrumentation\u2014from text prompts. Udio, founded by former Google DeepMind researchers, has gained traction for its generative music platform and rapid adoption by creators exploring AI-assisted songwriting. On the rights and licensing front, Klay Vision uses a licensed-first model, training its AI on music cleared through agreements with major record labels. ElevenLabs has expanded from voice technology into music projects that integrate AI tools with human-led production. Together, these companies illustrate a shift: AI is becoming embedded in the music industry\u2019s daily workflows not as a replacement, but as a new set of collaborative tools.

He explained that social media evolved from text, to photos with smartphone cameras, to video with faster mobile networks, and that the next phase will be driven by AI, enabling more immersive media experiences. Zuckerberg emphasized that current social media relies on recommendation algorithms, but Meta\u2019s future applications will use AI to 'understand' users and deliver personalized content while also generating high-quality, customized content. He previously proposed an AI-driven social media model in 2025, where content and creation would be dynamically mixed, and algorithms would manage vast content libraries. This vision is already being implemented through AI features such as the new 'Vibes' feed, which displays AI-generated short videos. He also predicted that future interactions on social platforms will allow users to create entire worlds or games from a single prompt and share them with friends, and that videos will become interactive. Meta reported Q4 2025 revenue of $59.89 billion (approximately 416.6 billion RMB), a 24% year-over-year increase, and earnings per share (EPS) of $8.88 (approximately 61.8 RMB), surpassing the market consensus of $8.21 (approximately 57.1 RMB).\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 08:50 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/tech/digi/2026-02-01/doc-inhkiath8801086.shtml)\n\n**As AI Artists Breaking Rush & Cain Walker Rule a Country Chart, Nashville Execs Weigh in: 'It's Incredibly Detrimental'**\nAs artificial intelligence increasingly infiltrates the music industry, concerns are mounting within the country music community about authenticity and fan trust. According to Billboard's Country Digital Song Sales chart dated November 15, 2025, one-third of the top 10 songs were AI-assisted: 'Walk My Walk' by Breaking Rust (No. 1, selling over 2,000 copies), 'Don't Tread on Me' by Cain Walker (No. 3, over 1,000 copies), and 'Ain't My Problem' (No. 9, slightly under 1,000 copies). These tracks feature bold, defiant lyrics and boisterous vocals, with 'Walk My Walk' having a gospel-stomping feel. While sales remain modest compared to top-selling tracks like Taylor Swift\u2019s 'The Fate of Ophelia' (29,000 copies), AI has already entered radio airplay\u2014Xania Monet became the first known AI artist to chart on the Adult R&B Airplay chart at No. 30. Other AI-assisted acts have also debuted on various Billboard charts. However, terrestrial country radio stations have not added AI songs to their rotations. Country radio consultant Joel Raab notes listeners react negatively to AI voices, and stations prioritize real artists tied to touring and endorsements. Fletcher Foster of F2 Entertainment Group warns that AI songs clog charts and displace real artists who generate revenue through touring, publishing, and brand partnerships. FEMco founder Leslie Fram calls the rise of AI music a 'notable wake-up call' but not an existential threat\u2014yet\u2014emphasizing that while casual listeners may not care, dedicated fans value human imperfection and storytelling. Martina McBride supports the NO FAKES Act, which aims to protect artists\u2019 voices from unauthorized AI replication. Raab and Fram predict that, despite short-term AI popularity, human music with soul and authenticity will ultimately prevail, as true fan loyalty is built on real stories and evolution, not algorithms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 01:29 AM\nSource:[Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/pro/ai-artists-breaking-rust-country-music-chart-reactions/)\n\n**How AI Outperforms Humans in Forecasting the Future**\nEvery three months, participants in the Metaculus Cup use artificial intelligence to predict geopolitical events in hopes of winning a prize of about $5,000. The platform poses questions such as 'Will Thailand experience a military coup before September\u202f2025?' and 'Will Israel strike the Iranian army again before September\u202f2025?' Experts estimate probabilities rather than simple yes/no answers. For example, Metaculus users correctly predicted the Russian invasion of Ukraine two weeks in advance and assigned a 90\u202f% probability to the U.S. v. Wade case roughly two months before it occurred. When the competition began in June, participants expected AI to outperform humans by 40\u202f% on average, but the Mantic AI system achieved over 80\u202f% accuracy. Prediction experts update their forecasts based on policy changes, allowing them to anticipate how virtual political interventions might affect future outcomes. Broad geopolitical forecasting remains extremely difficult, often requiring days and tens of thousands of dollars for a single question. The Rand Corporation estimates that human experts would need months to produce initial forecasts for all questions and to update them regularly. AI excels in data-rich, well-structured domains like weather or quantitative finance, but for geopolitics it must handle many interrelated factors. Large language models use the same complex information as human forecasters and can simulate human judgment, improving over time by predicting many questions, observing performance, and updating methods on a larger scale than humans can. Machines also have an unfair advantage in the competition: participants earn points not only for accuracy but also for coverage, the number of questions answered, and the frequency of updates. Even less accurate AI can rank highly by continuously updating estimates in response to emerging news\u2014a feat impossible for humans. This unfair advantage helps AI overcome the remaining challenge of producing high\u2011quality predictions for all questions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 11:47 AM\nSource:[elnabaa.net](https://www.elnabaa.net/1136072/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%81%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A4-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84)\n\n**AI Beats Humans In Predicting Future At International Competition**\nA British AI startup, Mantic AI, co\u2011founded by a former Google DeepMind researcher, finished eighth in the Metaculus Cup, an international forecasting competition that asked participants to predict the likelihood of 60 events over the summer. The competition included high\u2011profile events such as the public spat between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk and Kemi Badenoch\u2019s removal from the Conservative Party leadership. Mantic AI\u2019s performance surpassed 80\u202f% of the average score of the top human forecasters, a significant improvement over the 40\u202f% predicted by participants before the contest. Metaculus chief executive Deger Turan called the result 'impressive', while professional forecaster Ben Shindel admitted, 'It's certainly a weird feeling to be outdone by several bots at this point. We've really come a long way here compared with a year ago when the best bot was at something like rank 30.' Co\u2011founder Toby Shevlane noted that the system\u2019s predictions were more original than most human entrants, arguing that \u201cyou could say our system's predictions were more original than most human entrants, because people often cluster around the community average predictions.\u201d Mantic AI uses a mix of machine\u2011learning models from OpenAI, Google and DeepSeek to assign tasks based on each model\u2019s strengths.

The competition, run by a San\u202fFrancisco\u2011based company that serves investment funds and corporations, included events such as the public spat between U.S. President Donald Trump and Elon Musk, Kemi Badenoch\u2019s removal from the Conservative Party leadership, the Samoan general\u2011election seat distribution, and the number of acres burned by U.S. fires from January to August. Metaculus chief executive Deger Turan said human forecasters are currently \"doing better than AI forecasters\", while Mantic AI\u2019s co\u2011founder Toby Shevlane praised the bot\u2019s originality, noting that \"You could say our system's predictions were more original than most human entrants, because people often cluster around the community average predictions. The AI system often strongly disagreed. So, AI forecasters could be an antidote to groupthink.\" Mantic AI breaks each forecasting problem into sub\u2011tasks and assigns them to a roster of machine\u2011learning models including OpenAI, Google and DeepSeek. Although the bot\u2019s performance lagged behind the best human forecasters, experts predict it could reach parity or exceed human performance by 2029. Philip Tetlock, co\u2011author of Superforecasting, noted that expert humans still outperform top AI bots as of now.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 11:02 AM\nSource:[News18](https://www.news18.com/tech/ai-to-predict-future-british-startup-could-soon-overtake-human-forecasting-experts-ws-l-9585710.html)\n\n**AI Models Learn to Predict the Future: Will They Replace Expert Analysts?**\nThe article reports that artificial\u2011intelligence models are becoming increasingly accurate in predicting geopolitical events in the Metaculus forecasting contest, which offers a prize of about $5,000 and attracts roughly 600 participants. In June, the best human forecaster was expected to score about 40\u202f% of the average of top forecasters; the AI developed by Mantic achieved more than 80\u202f% of that average, placing eighth among 549 participants. Mantic\u2019s CEO Toby Shivein described the results as \u2018\u043f\u0440\u043e\u0441\u0442\u043e \u043d\u0435\u0432\u0435\u0440\u043e\u044f\u0442\u043d\u044b\u2019. RAND analyst Anthony Vassallo explained that forecasting helps governments anticipate events and that AI\u2019s ability to continuously update predictions gives it an \u2018\u043d\u0435\u0447\u0435\u0441\u0442\u043d\u043e\u0435 \u043f\u0440\u0435\u0438\u043c\u0443\u0449\u0435\u0441\u0442\u0432\u043e\u2019. The article also notes that Albania appointed an AI model, Diella, as a virtual official for public procurement. The piece is largely factual, with occasional praise for AI, and does not exhibit overt bias.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 07:06 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https://tsn.ua/ru/nauka_it/shi-modeli-uchatsya-predvidet-buduschee-zamenyat-li-oni-ekspertov-analitikov-2915837.html)\n\n**AI Models Learn to Predict the Future: Will They Replace Analyst Experts**\nThe article reports that the Metaculus forecasting competition, which offers a prize pool of about $5,000, has recently begun to include artificial\u2011intelligence (AI) models in its contests.  In the latest round, an AI developed by the British startup Mantic, led by CEO Toby Shivein, achieved a score of over 80\u202f%\u2014well above the 40\u202f% average that participants expected for the best bot\u2014placing it eighth among 549 entrants.  The competition featured 60 geopolitical questions, such as whether a military coup will occur in Thailand by September\u202f2025 or whether Israel will strike Iranian military targets by the same deadline.  The article cites RAND analyst Anthony Vassallo, who says forecasts help \u201cprevent surprises and aid decision\u2011makers,\u201d and Nathan Mazzotti, who notes that forecasting is ubiquitous in government agencies.  Vassallo argues that the AI\u2019s \u201cunfair advantage\u201d of continuously updating predictions is actually beneficial because it yields a large volume of high\u2011quality forecasts.  The piece also mentions that AI models can learn from millions of predictions, citing LightningRod\u2019s training on 100\u202f000 questions.  Finally, it notes that Albania appointed an AI model, Diella, as a virtual minister of public procurement, marking the first time a government position has been filled by a non\u2011human.  The article is largely factual and includes direct quotes, such as Shivein\u2019s description of the AI\u2019s results as \u2018simply incredible\u2019 and Vassallo\u2019s statement that he \u201cdoesn\u2019t need it to reach \u2018super\u2011forecasting\u2019 level; he just needs it to be as good as the crowd.\u2019\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 06:36 PM\nSource:[\u0422\u0421\u041d.ua](https://tsn.ua/nauka_it/shi-modeli-navchaiutsia-peredbachaty-maybutnye-chy-zaminiat-vony-ekspertiv-analitykiv-2915837.html)\n\n**AI Is Learning to Predict the Future -- And Beating Humans at It**\nMetaculus runs a quarterly forecasting cup in which participants predict geopolitical events for a prize pot of about $5,000. The platform poses questions such as 'Will Thailand experience a military coup before September 2025?' and 'Will Israel strike the Iranian military again before September 2025?'. Forecasters estimate probabilities weeks to months in advance, often with remarkable accuracy. For instance, users correctly predicted the date of the Russian invasion of Ukraine two weeks in advance, and assigned a 90\u202fpercent chance to Roe v.\u202fWade being overturned almost two months before the decision.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 18, 2025 05:29 PM\nSource:[TIME](https://time.com/7318577/ai-model-forecasting-predict-future-metaculus/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
