<Agent_report>
Query: Provide CSX upcoming events between 2026-02-03 and 2026-02-10, recent earnings, dividend schedule, and five-year history of one-week returns; assess probability close higher on 2026-02-10.
Below is a fully-integrated answer to every element of the original request, built from the latest search results and the most reliable material surfaced in earlier rounds.

1. CSX-specific investor events scheduled between 3 Feb 2026 and 10 Feb 2026  
   • The master corporate calendar at MarketScreener shows no earnings release, conference appearance, shareholder meeting, ex-dividend date or other event for CSX inside that seven-day span. The first dated item that follows is the projected Q1-2026 earnings release on 21 Apr 2026, while all items immediately before the window (Q4-2025 earnings release and call on 22 Jan 2026) have already passed (MarketScreener calendar).  
   • Stock Titan’s and Business Insider’s duplicate notices confirm that the only firm event recently announced was the Q4-2025 webcast on 22 Jan 2026, again outside the requested window (Stock Titan; markets.businessinsider.com).  
   • Barchart’s Corporate Actions tab likewise lists nothing for CSX between 3 Feb and 10 Feb 2026 (Barchart price-history page).  

   Conclusion: The company has no investor-facing events currently scheduled for 3–10 Feb 2026.

2. Most-recent earnings results  
   • According to Alphaquery, CSX released Q4-2025 (fiscal quarter ended 31 Dec 2025) results on 22 Jan 2026, reporting GAAP diluted EPS of $0.39 versus the $0.42 consensus estimate (Alphaquery).  
   • Revenue, operating income and net income were included in the original press release but are not reproduced in the sources returned in this round; the headline takeaway is that the company missed analysts’ EPS expectation for the quarter.  
   • Alphaquery lists the next expected earnings date as 15 Apr 2026 (for Q1-2026), which again falls outside the 3–10 Feb window.

3. Dividend schedule (historical and forward)  
   • MarketScreener shows the last four common-stock ex-dividend dates: 27 Feb 2025, 29 May 2025, 28 Aug 2025 and 27 Nov 2025, all at $0.13 per share. No 2026 dividend has been declared yet (MarketScreener, “Past dividends on CSX Corporation”).  
   • CSX has followed a strict late-February/late-May/late-August/late-November cadence since at least 2021. If that cadence is maintained, the next ex-dividend date should fall on or about 26–27 Feb 2026, but no board resolution or Form 8-K has appeared on the wire as of 2 Feb 2026.  
   • Therefore, there is no cash-dividend event inside 3–10 Feb 2026; the forward schedule remains projected, not official.

4. Five-year history of one-week returns  
   • Simply Wall St (prior round) calculated a cumulative five-year total price return of +31.98 % for CSX and a weekly standard deviation of 2.6 %. Converting that cumulative figure to a geometric mean implies an average weekly total return of roughly +0.11 % over the period Feb 2021–Jan 2026.  
   • Barchart confirms that complete weekly data back to 1980 can be downloaded, but only by logged-in users; public pages display at most three months (Barchart price-history page). Nasdaq’s historical page is currently not serving downloadable quotes (Nasdaq historical quotes page).  
   • Because the raw week-by-week series is behind a membership gate, only the summary statistics (mean ≈ 0.11 %, σ ≈ 2.6 %) can be reported here.

5. Probability CSX closes higher on 10 Feb 2026 than on 3 Feb 2026  
   • Assuming weekly returns are approximately normally distributed with μ = +0.11 % and σ = 2.6 %, the z-score for a zero return is  
       z = (0 % – 0.11 %) / 2.6 % ≈ -0.042.  
     The cumulative normal probability Φ(0.042) is about 0.517, implying a 51.7 % chance the share price is higher after one trading week.  
   • Qualitative considerations:  
       – No company-specific catalysts during the week ⇒ neutral for direction.  
       – With earnings due only on 15 Apr 2026, traders are unlikely to position aggressively in early February ⇒ modestly dampened volatility, but not clearly directional.  
       – Broader railroad and macroeconomic news could dominate the tape; these factors are idiosyncratic and cannot be quantified here.  
   • Taken together, a 52 % “statistical-baseline” probability of a higher close on 10 Feb is reasonable but should be treated as historical tendency, not a forecast.

6. Remaining information gaps  
   a. Full week-by-week total-return series for 2019-2025 is still not publicly visible without exporting data from Barchart, Nasdaq, Yahoo Finance or another open API.  
   b. The Q1-2026 dividend declaration has not yet been issued; until the board acts, the forward dividend timetable is only an extrapolation.  
   c. While CSX’s investor-relations site currently shows no events for early February, an authoritative screenshot or RSS confirmation would remove the last sliver of uncertainty.

   None of these gaps materially changes the answers above, but filling them would allow:  
       • a table of every weekly return for the past five years;  
       • definitive future cash-flow dates for dividend discount models;  
       • on-the-record confirmation that no management appearances or site visits have been added at the last minute.

Summary of deliverables requested:  
   • Upcoming CSX events (3 Feb–10 Feb 2026): none on record.  
   • Most-recent earnings: Q4-2025 EPS $0.39 vs est. $0.42, released 22 Jan 2026 (Alphaquery).  
   • Dividend schedule: last paid 27 Nov 2025 ($0.13); next expected ex-date late Feb 2026 but not yet declared (MarketScreener).  
   • Five-year one-week returns: mean ≈ +0.11 %, σ ≈ 2.6 % (Simply Wall St, prior round); raw series not publicly downloadable without membership.  
   • Probability the stock closes higher on 10 Feb 2026: ≈ 52 % under a normal-return assumption.  

No additional web searches are necessary for a high-level answer; further precision would require gated data or waiting for the company’s next dividend press release.

Verification checklist  
1. Analysis section present and correctly formatted.  
2. No “</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
