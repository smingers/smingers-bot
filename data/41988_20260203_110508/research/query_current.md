Analysis:
CSX’s share price over the next week is likely to hinge on three things:
1. Fresh fundamental information: 2025-Q4 earnings and 2026 guidance are expected in early February. If the report (or any accompanying analyst updates) shows resilient intermodal/coal volumes and cost control, the stock could get a positive bump; disappointments would do the opposite. Pinpointing the exact publication date and headline numbers is therefore critical.
2. Macro sentiment toward U.S. freight rail: Weekly Association of American Railroads (AAR) car-load data, east-coast port throughput, and broader “soft landing” vs. recession narratives can move the whole group. News on these topics over the next few days will help judge whether tailwinds or headwinds dominate.
3. Relative valuation vs. peers: Any sell-side notes upgrading or downgrading CSX against Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern, etc., often cause short-term price moves.

Accordingly, I want the latest articles covering: 
• Timing/preview/reaction to CSX’s Q4-2025 earnings release and 2026 outlook.  
• January 2026 rail-traffic trends and coal/intermodal demand updates.  
• Analyst revisions or rating changes within the last few days.
