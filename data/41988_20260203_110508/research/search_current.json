Analysts expect earnings of 41 cents per share, a slight decline from 42 cents in the same period the prior year. Revenue is forecasted at $3.54 billion, matching the year-ago figure. This follows CSX\u2019s better-than-expected third-quarter results announced on October 16, 2025, which led to a 2.9% share price increase, closing at $36.53 on Wednesday.

The company\u2019s share price closed at $35.30, down from its 52-week high of $37.25, amid a landmark ruling by the U.S. 2nd Circuit Court of Appeals that extended the Supreme Court\u2019s 2024 Murray v. UBS precedent to railroad employers. The decision revived a former CSX conductor\u2019s claim of wrongful termination for refusing to falsify safety data, lowering the evidentiary threshold for whistleblower retaliation claims and increasing legal exposure and reputational risk. This judicial development coincided with a fatal grade-crossing collision in Blue Island, Illinois, on 27 November 2025, which resulted in one death and one critical injury, prompting the temporary closure of Western Avenue at 135th Street and highlighting ongoing operational risks near populated areas. CSX responded with public statements affirming its commitment to safety and an internal review of crossing protocols. The timing of a confidential briefing by CSX\u2019s CFO and COO with UBS Global Industrials\u2014on the same day as the appellate ruling and the accident\u2014suggests a strategic effort to address investor concerns about financial performance (P/E ratio of 22.62, above the industry median of ~18), operational resilience, and regulatory compliance. Analysts anticipate CSX will reinforce its strategy to enhance transparency, streamline operations, and accelerate investments in rail automation and safety technologies. With a $64.98 billion market cap and a current stock price within a recoverable range (52-week low: $26.22), CSX remains a top-tier U.S. freight operator, though it faces competitive pressures from Union Pacific, Norfolk Southern, and emerging multimodal providers. Forward-looking recommendations include prioritizing automated crossing detection, implementing third-party whistleblower hotlines, conducting regular safety audits, and disciplined capital allocation for aging infrastructure. Stakeholders will closely monitor how CSX leverages this pivotal moment to strengthen its safety culture and operational excellence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 09:06 PM\nSource:[SentimentTrading](https://sentiment-trading.com/articles/csx-faces-legal-and-safety-challenges-as-share-price-stays-under-pressure/)\n\n**CSX January 2026 Options Begin Trading**\nCSX Corporation's January 2026 put options with a $35.00 strike price began trading on November 26, 2025, with a current bid of 50 cents. An investor selling-to-open this put contract commits to purchase CSX shares at $35.00 but collects a $0.50 premium, resulting in an effective cost basis of $34.50 per share (excluding broker commissions). This strike price represents approximately a 1% discount to the current stock price of $35.30, making the option out-of-the-money. According to analytical data, the probability of the put expiring worthless is 55%, which would yield a 1.43% return on the cash commitment or a 11.85% annualized return\u2014referred to by Stock Options Channel as the 'YieldBoost.' The implied volatility for the contract is 39%, while the actual trailing twelve-month volatility, based on 250 trading days and the closing price of $35.30, is 24%.

The company posted adjusted earnings of 44 cents per share, surpassing the expected 43 cents per share. Total revenue declined 1% year-over-year, primarily due to lower export coal prices and a drop in merchandise volume. However, volume increased 1% year-over-year to 1.61 million units and rose 2% sequentially. Revenue declines were partially offset by higher pricing in merchandise, intermodal volume growth, and increases in other revenue. Steve Angel, president and CEO of CSX, stated, 'We are proud that the network is operating well, and we see clear opportunities to leverage that operational strength moving forward. Looking ahead, CSX is well-positioned to build on this momentum to deliver long-term profitable growth and create value for our shareholders.'
