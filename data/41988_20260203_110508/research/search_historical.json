CSX-specific investor events scheduled between 3 Feb 2026 and 10 Feb 2026  \n   \u2022 The master corporate calendar at MarketScreener shows no earnings release, conference appearance, shareholder meeting, ex-dividend date or other event for CSX inside that seven-day span. The first dated item that follows is the projected Q1-2026 earnings release on 21 Apr 2026, while all items immediately before the window (Q4-2025 earnings release and call on 22 Jan 2026) have already passed (MarketScreener calendar).  \n   \u2022 Stock Titan\u2019s and Business Insider\u2019s duplicate notices confirm that the only firm event recently announced was the Q4-2025 webcast on 22 Jan 2026, again outside the requested window (Stock Titan; markets.businessinsider.com).  \n   \u2022 Barchart\u2019s Corporate Actions tab likewise lists nothing for CSX between 3 Feb and 10 Feb 2026 (Barchart price-history page).  \n\n   Conclusion: The company has no investor-facing events currently scheduled for 3\u201310 Feb 2026.\n\n2. Most-recent earnings results  \n   \u2022 According to Alphaquery, CSX released Q4-2025 (fiscal quarter ended 31 Dec 2025) results on 22 Jan 2026, reporting GAAP diluted EPS of $0.39 versus the $0.42 consensus estimate (Alphaquery).  \n   \u2022 Revenue, operating income and net income were included in the original press release but are not reproduced in the sources returned in this round; the headline takeaway is that the company missed analysts\u2019 EPS expectation for the quarter.  \n   \u2022 Alphaquery lists the next expected earnings date as 15 Apr 2026 (for Q1-2026), which again falls outside the 3\u201310 Feb window.\n\n3. Dividend schedule (historical and forward)  \n   \u2022 MarketScreener shows the last four common-stock ex-dividend dates: 27 Feb 2025, 29 May 2025, 28 Aug 2025 and 27 Nov 2025, all at $0.13 per share. No 2026 dividend has been declared yet (MarketScreener, \u201cPast dividends on CSX Corporation\u201d).  \n   \u2022 CSX has followed a strict late-February/late-May/late-August/late-November cadence since at least 2021. If that cadence is maintained, the next ex-dividend date should fall on or about 26\u201327 Feb 2026, but no board resolution or Form 8-K has appeared on the wire as of 2 Feb 2026.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, there is no cash-dividend event inside 3\u201310 Feb 2026; the forward schedule remains projected, not official.\n\n4. Five-year history of one-week returns  \n   \u2022 Simply Wall St (prior round) calculated a cumulative five-year total price return of +31.98 % for CSX and a weekly standard deviation of 2.6 %. Converting that cumulative figure to a geometric mean implies an average weekly total return of roughly +0.11 % over the period Feb 2021\u2013Jan 2026.  \n   \u2022 Barchart confirms that complete weekly data back to 1980 can be downloaded, but only by logged-in users; public pages display at most three months (Barchart price-history page). Nasdaq\u2019s historical page is currently not serving downloadable quotes (Nasdaq historical quotes page).  \n   \u2022 Because the raw week-by-week series is behind a membership gate, only the summary statistics (mean \u2248 0.11 %, \u03c3 \u2248 2.6 %) can be reported here.\n\n5. Probability CSX closes higher on 10 Feb 2026 than on 3 Feb 2026  \n   \u2022 Assuming weekly returns are approximately normally distributed with \u03bc = +0.11 % and \u03c3 = 2.6 %, the z-score for a zero return is  \n       z = (0 % \u2013 0.11 %) / 2.6 % \u2248 -0.042.  \n     The cumulative normal probability \u03a6(0.042) is about 0.517, implying a 51.7 % chance the share price is higher after one trading week.  \n   \u2022 Qualitative considerations:  \n       \u2013 No company-specific catalysts during the week \u21d2 neutral for direction.  \n       \u2013 With earnings due only on 15 Apr 2026, traders are unlikely to position aggressively in early February \u21d2 modestly dampened volatility, but not clearly directional.  \n       \u2013 Broader railroad and macroeconomic news could dominate the tape; these factors are idiosyncratic and cannot be quantified here.  \n   \u2022 Taken together, a 52 % \u201cstatistical-baseline\u201d probability of a higher close on 10 Feb is reasonable but should be treated as historical tendency, not a forecast.\n\n6. Remaining information gaps  \n   a. Full week-by-week total-return series for 2019-2025 is still not publicly visible without exporting data from Barchart, Nasdaq, Yahoo Finance or another open API.  \n   b. The Q1-2026 dividend declaration has not yet been issued; until the board acts, the forward dividend timetable is only an extrapolation.  \n   c. While CSX\u2019s investor-relations site currently shows no events for early February, an authoritative screenshot or RSS confirmation would remove the last sliver of uncertainty.\n\n   None of these gaps materially changes the answers above, but filling them would allow:  \n       \u2022 a table of every weekly return for the past five years;  \n       \u2022 definitive future cash-flow dates for dividend discount models;  \n       \u2022 on-the-record confirmation that no management appearances or site visits have been added at the last minute.\n\nSummary of deliverables requested:  \n   \u2022 Upcoming CSX events (3 Feb\u201310 Feb 2026): none on record.  \n   \u2022 Most-recent earnings: Q4-2025 EPS $0.39 vs est. $0.42, released 22 Jan 2026 (Alphaquery).  \n   \u2022 Dividend schedule: last paid 27 Nov 2025 ($0.13); next expected ex-date late Feb 2026 but not yet declared (MarketScreener).  \n   \u2022 Five-year one-week returns: mean \u2248 +0.11 %, \u03c3 \u2248 2.6 % (Simply Wall St, prior round); raw series not publicly downloadable without membership.  \n   \u2022 Probability the stock closes higher on 10 Feb 2026: \u2248 52 % under a normal-return assumption.  \n\nNo additional web searches are necessary for a high-level answer; further precision would require gated data or waiting for the company\u2019s next dividend press release.\n\nVerification checklist  \n1.
