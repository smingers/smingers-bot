**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Recent News Articles (January-February 2026):**

1. **Multiple sources (CNN, WRAL, Guardian, Oklahoma Voice, etc.) - January-February 2026:** Document Tillis's high-profile conflicts with Trump administration officials:
   - **Stephen Miller/Greenland (Jan 7, 2026):** Tillis delivered Senate floor speech calling Miller's Greenland comments "absurd" and "insane," telling him to "get out of this job." Quality: Multiple reliable sources (CNN, Guardian) with direct quotes. **FACTUAL.**
   - **Kristi Noem/DHS (Jan 28, 2026):** Tillis expressed "no confidence" in DHS Secretary Noem, called her "incompetent." Trump called Tillis a "loser" in response. Quality: Reliable (WRAL, multiple sources). **FACTUAL.**
   - **Jerome Powell/Fed Investigation (Jan 12-Feb 2, 2026):** Tillis vowed to block all Fed nominees until DOJ investigation of Powell is resolved. Quality: Multiple reliable sources (CNBC, Benzinga, Guardian). **FACTUAL.**

2. **Kevin Warsh Nomination Coverage (Jan 30-Feb 3, 2026):** Extensive coverage of Trump nominating Warsh as Fed Chair and Tillis's opposition:
   - Trump nominated Warsh on Feb 1-2, 2026
   - Tillis immediately stated he would block confirmation
   - White House Press Secretary Leavitt accused Tillis of "holding economy hostage" (Feb 2, 2026)
   - Trump called Tillis a "blocker" (Jan 30-Feb 1, 2026)
   Quality: Multiple reliable sources (Oklahoma Voice, Townhall, Fox News, Benzinga, Market Screener). **FACTUAL - this is major, breaking news as of Feb 1-3.**

3. **Market/Financial Coverage (Feb 1-3, 2026):** TalkMarkets, CoinCentral, Business of Fashion all covered Warsh nomination and Tillis opposition as major market-moving news. Quality: Financial news sources treating this as significant. **FACTUAL.**

**Key Factual Finding:** The Warsh nomination story broke on **February 1-2, 2026** - just 1-2 days before the question opened (Feb 3). This is **extremely recent, breaking news** involving:
- Presidential nomination
- Senator blocking confirmation
- White House publicly attacking Tillis
- Trump calling Tillis names
- Major financial market implications

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**STRONG EVIDENCE for recent spike:**
- **Multiple independent sources** confirm Warsh nomination story broke Feb 1-2, 2026
- **Direct causal mechanism:** Presidential nominations + public feuds = search interest
- **Structural factor:** This is a constitutional confirmation battle, not a passing comment
- **Market impact:** Financial markets reacted (dollar up 0.8%), indicating significance
- **White House amplification:** Press Secretary publicly criticized Tillis by name (Feb 2)

**STRONG EVIDENCE for likely decrease:**
- **Google Trends decay pattern:** Political spikes typically decay 60-80% within 5-7 days
- **Historical pattern:** Non-election-year senators see rapid interest decay after news
- **No scheduled catalysts:** No known events Feb 4-10 to sustain interest
- **Retirement status:** Tillis not running in 2026, reducing sustained interest

**MODERATE EVIDENCE for potential stability/increase:**
- **Ongoing confirmation battle:** Unlike one-off comments, Fed chair confirmation is a process
- **Trump's pattern:** Trump often continues attacking critics over multiple days
- **Committee dynamics:** 13-12 Republican majority means Tillis genuinely can block nomination
- **Economic stakes:** Fed chair affects everyone, broader interest than typical Senate news

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**
- Speculation about future Trump statements
- Anecdotal comparisons to other political feuds

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction Window:** 7 days (Feb 3-10, 2026)

**Critical Timeline:**
- **Feb 1-2:** Warsh nomination announced, Tillis opposition, White House attacks
- **Feb 3 (TODAY):** Question opens - likely still elevated from Feb 1-2 news
- **Feb 4-10:** No known scheduled events

**Google Trends Mechanics:**
- Compares Feb 10 value to Feb 3 value
- ±3 threshold for "Doesn't change"
- Values are relative to 30-day period (Jan 11-Feb 10)

**Key Insight:** Feb 3 (today) is **1-2 days after major breaking news**. Google Trends typically shows:
- Day 0-1 (news breaks): Spike to peak
- Day 2-3: Still elevated but starting decay
- Day 4-7: Rapid decay (50-80% drop from peak)

**If timeframe halved (3.5 days):** Would increase "Doesn't change" probability significantly (~40%), as decay wouldn't be complete.

**If timeframe doubled (14 days):** Would increase "Decreases" probability to ~80%, as decay would be nearly complete.

**(d) Justification:**

**Shift from Outside View (62% Decreases, 23% Doesn't change, 15% Increases):**

**Major factor requiring recalibration:** The outside view analysis **did not account for the Feb 1-2 Warsh nomination breaking news**. This is a **critical oversight** because:

1. **Feb 3 baseline is artificially elevated:** Today's Google Trends value likely reflects a spike from Feb 1-2 news, not a normal baseline. The question compares Feb 10 to Feb 3, meaning we're comparing "7 days after spike" to "1-2 days after spike."

2. **Natural decay is highly probable:** Starting from an elevated Feb 3 baseline, the typical decay pattern would bring Feb 10 significantly lower unless new news emerges.

3. **Competing evidence:**
   - **For Decreases:** Strong decay pattern, no scheduled catalysts, retirement status
   - **Against Decreases:** Ongoing confirmation process, Trump's tendency to continue feuds, constitutional significance
   - **For Increases:** Would require new major news (Trump escalation, Senate developments, etc.)
   - **For Doesn't change:** ±3 threshold creates buffer zone, possible sustained coverage

**Revised Assessment:**

The **Warsh nomination is a major, multi-day story** (not a one-day spike), which could sustain interest longer than typical Tillis news. However:
- By Feb 10 (7 days later), initial spike will have substantially decayed
- No evidence of scheduled events to create new spike
- Trump may continue attacks, but diminishing returns on search interest
- Financial markets have already priced in the news

**Calibrated Probability Shifts:**
- **Decreases:** Increase from 62% to **68%** (strong decay pattern from elevated Feb 3 baseline)
- **Doesn't change:** Decrease from 23% to **20%** (less likely to stay stable over 7 days)
- **Increases:** Decrease from 15% to **12%** (would require significant new developments)

Probability calibration:

Starting from outside view (62% Decreases, 23% Doesn't change, 15% Increases), I adjust for:

1. **Feb 1-2 breaking news creates elevated Feb 3 baseline** (+6% to Decreases): The comparison point (Feb 3) is likely elevated from the Warsh nomination story, making decay to Feb 10 more probable.

2. **Ongoing confirmation battle vs. one-off comment** (-3% from Decreases, +3% to Doesn't change, redistributed): This isn't a passing controversy but a constitutional process that could sustain coverage.

3. **±3 threshold buffer** (-3% from extremes to middle): The "Doesn't change" band captures ±3 points, which is meaningful for week-over-week political searches.

**Final calibration:**
- Decreases: 62% + 6% - 3% = **68%**
- Doesn't change: 23% - 3% + 3% = **20%** (adjusted down slightly as 7-day window favors directional movement)
- Increases: 15% - 3% = **12%**

**Confidence check:**
- 68% = 2.1:1 odds for Decreases - feels appropriate given strong decay pattern but meaningful uncertainty
- 20% = 1:4 odds for stability - reasonable given ±3 buffer and ongoing story
- 12% = 1:7.3 odds for increase - requires unexpected developments but Trump is unpredictable

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Google Trends for "thom tillis" on Feb 10 be >3 higher (Increases), ±3 (Doesn't change), or >3 lower (Decreases) than Feb 3?

2. **Base rate:** Outside view: 62% Decreases, 23% Doesn't change, 15% Increases. Final prediction maintains this general structure with modest adjustments for Feb 1-2 breaking news.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = Decreases (68%); Least likely = Increases (12%). Makes sense: Feb 3 elevated from recent news, natural decay over 7 days is most probable.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Warsh nomination broke Feb 1-2, creating likely spike captured in Feb 3 baseline
   - Google Trends decay pattern: 60-80% drop within 7 days for political news
   - No scheduled events Feb 4-10 to sustain/increase interest
   - Ongoing confirmation battle could sustain coverage longer than one-off comment
   - ±3 threshold creates meaningful stability band

5. **Blind spot:** Trump continues attacking Tillis daily Feb 4-10, creating sustained news cycle that maintains or increases searches. Would shift ~15-20% from Decreases to Increases/Doesn't change.

6. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [12, 20, 68]
