**CNN (February 2, 2026):** Brief video headline noting Tillis said "Stephen Miller needs to know 'what he's talking about or get out of this job.'" Limited context but recent and relevant. Quality: Major news source but minimal detail in this particular piece.

**New York Post (January 28, 2026):** Reports Tillis calling for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem's resignation after ICE shooting incident, with Trump calling Tillis a "loser" in response. Contains direct quotes from both parties. Quality: Major tabloid with verifiable quotes from named sources.

**Asheville Watchdog (June 4, 2025):** Detailed polling analysis showing Tillis weakness (26% approval, trailing Cooper 47%-43%). Contains specific polling methodology. Quality: Regional watchdog journalism with transparent data sourcing.

**Agent Report:** Indicates inability to obtain actual Google Trends daily data for January-February 2026, but identifies key news events: retirement announcement (early Jan), NYT poll (Jan 16), ICE shooting controversy (late Jan-early Feb). Notes these would likely create search spikes but lacks quantitative data.

**Key Factual Timeline:**
- Early January 2026: Tillis retirement announcement
- January 16-17, 2026: Greenland criticism + NYT poll release
- January 24, 2026: Alex Pretti ICE shooting incident
- January 28, 2026: Tillis calls for Noem resignation; Trump calls him "loser"
- February 2, 2026: Continued criticism of Stephen Miller
- February 3, 2026: Question opens (TODAY)

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible Reference Classes:**
1. **Google Trends for retiring senators during final year:** Typically declining interest unless involved in major controversies
2. **Google Trends for politicians criticized by Trump:** Often show short-term spikes followed by decay
3. **Google Trends for senators in non-election years:** Generally low and stable baseline
4. **Google Trends week-over-week changes for political figures:** High volatility around news events, rapid decay

**Most Suitable:** Politicians involved in ongoing controversies with the administration. Tillis has been in sustained conflict with Trump/White House since late January (Noem, Miller, Greenland), creating multiple news cycles.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction Window:** 7 days (Feb 3-10, 2026)

**Recent Pattern (Jan-Feb 2026):**
- Multiple high-profile news events in January (retirement, Greenland, ICE shooting, Noem)
- Sustained media coverage through early February (Miller criticism on Feb 2)
- Agent report suggests "choppy profile" with clustered attention

**Typical Google Trends Behavior:**
- Spikes occur on day of major news, decay within 2-4 days
- Baseline for non-election-year senators: typically 10-30 range
- News-driven spikes can reach 50-100 range
- Week-over-week, politicians often show ±20-40 point swings during active news cycles

**Critical Factors for Feb 3-10:**
- Feb 3 (today) is likely still elevated from Feb 2 Miller criticism
- No major scheduled events visible in sources for Feb 4-10
- Tillis is not running for reelection, reducing baseline interest
- News cycle may shift to other topics without new Tillis developments

**(d) Justification:**

The outside view suggests **"Decreases"** is most likely for several reasons:

1. **Natural decay pattern:** The Feb 2 Miller criticism likely created a spike that would decay over subsequent days. Google Trends typically shows 3-5 day decay cycles after political news events.

2. **Absence of scheduled catalysts:** No debates, votes, or scheduled events appear in the Feb 4-10 window that would drive new searches.

3. **Non-candidate status:** Tillis announced retirement, reducing sustained public interest compared to active candidates.

4. **Saturation effect:** Multiple controversies in January (Greenland, Noem, Miller) may have exhausted the "interested audience" - those who would search have already done so.

5. **Competing news cycles:** Early February 2026 likely has other political stories drawing attention away from a retiring senator's criticism.

However, there's meaningful uncertainty because:
- Unpredictable Trump responses could create new spikes
- Congressional actions or statements could generate news
- The ±3 threshold means small movements could result in "Doesn't change"

**Outside View Calibration:**

**(a) True Probability vs. Hedging:**
I must assess the actual likelihood of each outcome, not hedge toward 33/33/33. The evidence strongly suggests directional movement rather than stability.

**(b) Established Distributions:**
Google Trends for political figures in non-election periods typically show:
- ~60-70% probability of week-over-week decline after news spike
- ~20-25% probability of stability (±3 points)
- ~10-15% probability of increase (requiring new news)

**(c) Probability Significance:**
The ±3 threshold is important. A value of 45 on Feb 3 declining to 43 on Feb 10 would be "Doesn't change," while 45→41 would be "Decreases." This creates a meaningful probability band for stability.

**(d) Upset Rate:**
Political Google Trends are subject to:
- Unexpected Trump statements (~10-15% chance in any given week)
- Unforeseen controversies (~5-10% chance)
- Media amplification effects (~15-20% chance of extending news cycles)

Combined upset probability: ~25-30% that something unexpected maintains or increases interest.

**Final Calibration:**
- **Decreases:** Base rate of 60-70% for post-spike decay, adjusted down slightly (to 62%) for the ±3 buffer zone and Trump unpredictability
- **Doesn't change:** 23% accounting for the ±3 threshold creating a stability band and possibility of minor news maintaining interest
- **Increases:** 15% for unexpected developments (Trump attacks, new controversy, congressional action)

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 15%
Doesn't change: 23%
Decreases: 62%
