## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **U.S. Senators not seeking reelection in their final year:**
   - Typically see declining search interest as they become less relevant
   - However, controversial statements can create temporary spikes
   - Suitability: High - directly matches Tillis's situation

2. **Politicians in conflict with their party's president:**
   - Can generate episodic search spikes during controversies
   - Pattern: Sharp increases during confrontations, then decay
   - Suitability: High - captures the Tillis-Trump dynamic

3. **North Carolina politicians during election cycles:**
   - NC Senate race is competitive, generating sustained interest
   - Even retiring incumbents remain newsworthy through primary season
   - Suitability: Moderate - relevant but Tillis isn't running

4. **Google Trends for political figures week-to-week:**
   - Baseline: Most politicians see relatively stable search interest with occasional news-driven spikes
   - Week-to-week changes >3 points are common during active news cycles
   - Suitability: High - most directly applicable

**Selected Reference Class:** Politicians in their final term who periodically clash with their party leadership, examined through weekly Google Trends patterns.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window:** 7 days (Feb 3-10, 2026)

**Recent Historical Pattern (Jan-Feb 2026):**
- Jan 17: Greenland criticism (Senate floor speech)
- Jan 24: Minneapolis ICE shooting
- Jan 28: Calls for Noem resignation + Trump calls Tillis "loser"
- Feb 2: Miller criticism continues

**Pattern Observations:**
1. Tillis generated multiple news cycles in late January (Greenland, Noem, Trump feud)
2. The Trump "loser" comment (Jan 28) likely created a search spike
3. By Feb 2-3, the Noem/Miller storyline was ~5-9 days old
4. No major new Tillis-specific events scheduled for Feb 3-10 window
5. News cycles typically peak within 1-3 days of an event, then decay

**Typical Google Trends Behavior:**
- News-driven spikes usually last 3-7 days before returning to baseline
- Politicians not running for office see declining baseline interest
- Week-over-week changes of >3 points require fresh, significant news

## (d) Justification

The Feb 3-10 timeframe sits in the aftermath of intense Tillis news coverage (Jan 17-Feb 2). The key events driving search interest were:
- Greenland criticism (Jan 17)
- Trump calling him a "loser" (Jan 28)
- Noem resignation calls (Jan 28)
- Miller criticism (Feb 2)

By Feb 3, these stories are 6-15 days old. In typical news cycles, Google search interest peaks within 24-72 hours of a story breaking, then declines. The Feb 3 baseline likely reflects elevated interest from the late-January Trump feud, but that interest would be expected to decay through the Feb 3-10 window absent new developments.

Critical factors:
1. **No scheduled events:** No debates, hearings, or planned appearances for Tillis in this window
2. **Lame duck status:** Not seeking reelection reduces baseline interest
3. **News cycle timing:** Major Tillis stories are 1-2 weeks old by Feb 10
4. **Competing news:** Early February 2026 likely has other political stories drawing attention
5. **Historical pattern:** Politicians see search interest decline after controversy peaks

The most likely scenario is that Feb 3 represents an elevated baseline from late-January news, and Feb 10 shows a return toward lower baseline levels. A decrease of >3 points is probable. An increase would require unexpected new Tillis-related news (health issue, major policy announcement, new Trump attack, etc.). Stability within 3 points is possible if Feb 3 already reflects a normalized post-spike level.

## Outside View Calibration

**Probability Anchoring:**
- Base rate for "no change" in Google Trends week-over-week: ~30-40% for most politicians
- Base rate for decrease after news spike: ~50-60%
- Base rate for increase absent new news: ~10-20%

**Adjustments:**
1. **Recent news intensity:** The Jan 28-Feb 2 period had multiple Tillis stories, suggesting Feb 3 baseline is elevated → increases probability of decrease
2. **Lame duck effect:** Not seeking reelection reduces sustained interest → increases probability of decrease
3. **News cycle decay:** 7-15 day gap from major stories → strongly favors decrease
4. **Uncertainty about Feb 3 baseline:** If Feb 3 already reflects post-spike normalization, "no change" becomes more likely

**Upset rate consideration:**
In political Google Trends, unexpected increases occur ~15-20% of the time, usually driven by:
- Unexpected scandals or controversies
- Health issues
- Viral social media moments
- Presidential attacks

Given Trump's pattern of attacking Tillis and the ongoing Noem controversy, there's non-trivial risk of new developments.

**Calibrated Assessment:**
- Decrease: 60% (most likely given news cycle decay)
- No change: 27% (possible if Feb 3 baseline already normalized)
- Increase: 13% (requires unexpected new news)

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 13%
Doesn't change: 27%
Decreases: 60%
