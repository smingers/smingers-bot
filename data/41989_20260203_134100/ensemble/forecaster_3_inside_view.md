Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Between 2026-02-03 and 2026-02-10 on Google Trends (US) for “thom tillis”: “Doesn’t change” if 2/10 is within ±3 of 2/03; otherwise “Increases” (>+3) or “Decreases” (<-3).

2) (a) Source analysis (what each says; quality/date; fact vs opinion)

- Spectrum Local News (2024-12-10): Regional politics piece on Tillis starting 2026 reelection effort; discusses possible challengers and party tensions. Reasonably credible local reporting but dated for this 1-week question. Mostly factual campaign/race framing; some expert commentary (Chris Cooper).
- Tillis.senate.gov (ongoing): Constituent services/contact page; no news value for forecasting search interest.
- GovTrack profile (accessed Feb 2026): Biographical/legislative statistics; high reliability for factual background; not predictive of short-run search changes.
- CNN (2026-01-07): National outlet; reports Tillis criticizing Stephen Miller re Greenland; reliable for the event, but it’s outside the forecast week and likely decayed.
- WRAL (2026-01-28): Strong regional outlet; Tillis criticizes DHS Sec. Noem; factual event likely created a short spike, but late January.
- The Guardian (2026-01-12): Major outlet; reports Tillis vowing to block Fed nominations amid DOJ probe into Powell; likely factual core though framing is interpretive.
- AskNews set (late Jan–Feb 2/3, 2026): Multiple articles from varied outlets:
  - Oklahoma Voice (2026-02-02): Straight news on Warsh nomination + Tillis opposition; moderate-high reliability.
  - Fox News (2026-02-01): Reports WH press secretary attacking Tillis; factual that statements were made, but partisan framing.
  - Townhall (2026-02-02): Similar WH/Tillis dispute; more partisan, but still indicative of attention/coverage.
  - TalkMarkets (2026-02-01/02): Market commentary; useful context that the dispute is being discussed, but not a direct measure of public search.
  - Business of Fashion / other syndications repeating same underlying story: secondary but confirms breadth of pickup.
  - A few AskNews items contain obvious date anomalies (e.g., “February 31”, “February 30”) or odd translations; I discount those for chronology but still treat them as evidence of widespread international pickup of the Tillis/Warsh/Powell angle.

Bottom line from sources: there is a fresh, multi-outlet news hook immediately adjacent to 2/03—Tillis blocking/conditioning Fed chair confirmation and the White House publicly criticizing him—more timely than the older Greenland/Noem episodes.

3) (b) Evidence analysis (weighted vs resolution)

Strong evidence (moves probabilities materially)
- Broad, multi-outlet coverage Feb 1–2 that Tillis is central to the Warsh nomination fight (blocking/conditioning confirmation) and is being attacked by the White House press secretary. This kind of national political + markets story can keep searches elevated beyond a 1–3 day spike because it’s an ongoing process (nomination/committee dynamics/DOJ probe), not a single gaffe.

Moderate evidence
- Recent January controversies (Greenland comments, Noem “no confidence”) suggest Tillis has been in the news repeatedly, raising the chance that baseline on 2/03 is already elevated (which mechanically makes “Decreases” easier to hit by 2/10 if attention fades).
- Structural relevance: the Fed chair confirmation is inherently high-salience; if there’s any committee scheduling, Trump comments, DOJ updates, or new statements by Tillis within the week, searches could hold steady or spike again.

Weak evidence
- Long-run election-cycle stories (2026 race, possible challengers) are not time-locked to Feb 3–10 and are unlikely to drive a >3 move in a single week unless a major candidacy announcement drops.

4) (c) Timeframe analysis
Forecast window is 7 days (from today, 2026-02-03, to 2026-02-10).
- If halved (~3–4 days): less time for news decay; “Doesn’t change” becomes more likely relative to “Decreases.”
- If doubled (~14 days): more time for the Warsh/Powell story to be replaced by other headlines unless there’s a scheduled hearing; “Decreases” would become more likely.

5) (d) Justification: updating the outside view
Outside view base rates: Increases 13 / Doesn’t change 27 / Decreases 60.

Key inside-view update: unlike the “post-spike decay” framing, we’re at the front end of a live, nationally-covered political-economic dispute (Warsh nomination + Powell DOJ probe + Tillis as pivotal Senate Banking vote). That makes it more plausible that 2/10 remains near 2/03 (within ±3) or even ticks up if there’s a fresh development. However, absent a discrete new event near 2/09–2/10, attention still tends to fade, and because 2/03 may already reflect elevated interest from Feb 1–2 headlines, mean reversion still favors “Decreases.”

So I pull probability mass from “Decreases” into “Doesn’t change” and a smaller amount into “Increases.”

Probability calibration
- Decreases remains the plurality outcome, but reduced from 60 to ~51 because coverage appears ongoing rather than fully “past peak.”
- Doesn’t change increases from 27 to ~32 because ongoing process stories often sustain a plateau for about a week.
- Increases rises modestly from 13 to ~17 to account for plausible catalysts (new Trump/Tillis exchange, a committee scheduling headline, or DOJ step) that could trigger a second spike.

Checklist:
1) Criteria/options: Compare 2/10 vs 2/03 Google Trends value; within 3 = no change; >+3 increase; <-3 decrease.
2) Outside view base rate used: [13, 27, 60].
3) Consistency: Most likely = Decreases; least likely = Increases; yes—decay is typical, but ongoing story props up stability risk.
4) Key evidence (most important):
   - Multiple outlets Feb 1–2: Tillis pivotal in Warsh nomination standoff.
   - White House press pushback increases visibility beyond niche Senate news.
   - 2/03 likely elevated due to immediate pre-window headlines → mean reversion pressure.
   - Lack of a known scheduled “event day” before 2/10 keeps “Increases” contained.
5) Blind spot: A sharp new development on Feb 9–10 (committee action, Trump personal attack, DOJ filing) could drive a late-week spike → would shift mass from Decreases/No change to Increases.
6) Technicalities: Probabilities are 0–100 integers summing to 100.

Probabilities: [17, 32, 51]
