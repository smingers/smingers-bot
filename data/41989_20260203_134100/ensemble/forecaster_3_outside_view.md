Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (summary, quality, and what’s factual vs opinion)
1) **Carolina Journal (Jun 29, 2025)** – “Trump targets Tillis…”  
   - **What it says (facts):** Reports Trump criticizing Tillis over a vote and hinting at backing a 2026 primary challenger; mentions specific polling cross-tabs and hypothetical matchups.  
   - **Quality/reliability:** Regional outlet; plausible but polling details and framing benefit from cross-checking. Date is far from the forecast window, so it’s mainly **background** about Tillis being a recurring news subject.  
   - **Opinion vs fact:** Trump quotes and described vote are factual claims; interpretations like “missing in action” are rhetoric/opinion.

2) **CP24 (Jan 17, 2026)** – “Tillis takes on the White House, but not Trump”  
   - **What it says (facts):** Describes Tillis criticizing Trump advisers (e.g., Stephen Miller), Greenland rhetoric, DOJ actions, etc.; states Tillis is not seeking reelection (key contextual claim).  
   - **Quality:** Mainstream broadcaster; generally solid for event description, though it’s a secondary source for US politics. Close enough in time to indicate Tillis had **recent national-media attention**.  
   - **Opinion vs fact:** Direct quotes are facts; claims about motivation (“because he’s retiring”) are interpretive.

3) **CNN video headline roundup (Feb 2, 2026)**  
   - **What it says (facts):** Only that CNN ran a headline quoting Tillis criticizing Stephen Miller.  
   - **Quality:** CNN is high quality, but this is **thin evidence** (headline snippet; low context). Still relevant because it suggests Tillis was in the news **immediately before Feb 3**.

4) **New York Post (Jan 28, 2026)** – Trump calls Tillis/Murkowski “losers” over Noem resignation call  
   - **What it says (facts):** Reports Tillis calling for DHS Secretary Kristi Noem’s resignation after a Minneapolis incident; reports Trump’s insults and Tillis quotes.  
   - **Quality:** Tabloid-leaning; often accurate on the “who-said-what” aspect when quotes are on-record, but framing can be sensational. Useful mainly as evidence of a **news hook likely to spike searches**.  
   - **Opinion vs fact:** “Losers” etc. are opinions/insults; the existence of the dispute and quotes are factual claims.

5) **The Guardian (Jan 17, 2026)** – GOP dissent on Greenland  
   - **What it says (facts):** Reports Tillis calling Greenland seizure “absurd,” plus other GOP figures’ comments.  
   - **Quality:** High-quality international outlet; likely reliable for public statements. Relevance: another **recent spike-capable controversy**.

6) **Asheville Watchdog (Jun 4, 2025)** – “Tillis’s strongest opponents…”  
   - **What it says (facts):** Polling numbers and descriptions of intra-party weakness; mentions candidates and censure context.  
   - **Quality:** Local investigative-style outlet; polling claims should be verified but are plausible. Mostly **background** (not tightly tied to Feb 3–10 micro-movement in Google Trends).

7) **Agent report (Google Trends volatility attempt, Jan–Feb 2026)**  
   - **What it says (facts):** Confirms the key limitation: we do **not** have the daily Google Trends series; suggests likely drivers (poll releases, broadcast segments, controversy) but cannot quantify volatility.  
   - **Quality:** Meta-analysis; useful for scoping uncertainty. The “likely surge” claims are reasonable but still inferential without the series.

**Bottom line from sources:** Multiple controversies put Tillis in national/state news in **mid-to-late January** and at least a **headline mention on Feb 2**, which increases the chance Feb 3 begins at an elevated interest level. None of the sources provide the actual Trend values.

### (b) Reference class analysis (base rates)
Plausible reference classes for a 7-day change in Google Trends for a named politician:

1) **“Mid-tier US senator name” searches, week-over-week (non-election week).**  
   - Suitability: High. Tillis is nationally relevant but not a constant top-search figure.

2) **Event-driven political names (spike then decay) over a 1-week window.**  
   - Suitability: High if Feb 3 is close to a controversy peak (which the Feb 2 CNN headline and late-Jan dispute suggest).

3) **All Google Trends terms week-to-week.**  
   - Suitability: Low; too broad, ignores news-driven volatility specific to politics and low-volume measurement noise.

**Most suitable reference class:** #1 combined with #2: *mid-tier politician queries with occasional news spikes and mean reversion.*

---

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Forecast window:** From **2026-02-03 to 2026-02-10** (7 days).  
- **Resolution rule:** “Doesn’t change” if Feb 10 is within ±3 of Feb 3; otherwise Increase/Decrease.
- **Typical short-window pattern:** For politician-name searches, attention is often **shock/aftershock driven**. Absent a fresh development, interest tends to **decay** over several days after a controversy peak. Measurement noise for lower-volume terms can still produce ±4+ moves even without major news, but **mean reversion** is a common pattern.

---

### (d) Justification (outside-view synthesis)
- The outside view starts from: over any random 7-day span, a mid-tier politician’s search interest is more likely to be **roughly flat or drifting back toward baseline** than to trend upward, unless a new major event occurs.
- The provided context suggests Tillis had **recent media salience** (Noem resignation dispute; “Stephen Miller” criticism; Greenland flap). If Feb 3 is on the **shoulder of a spike**, the base-rate expectation is **gradual decline** by Feb 10 unless another headline hits.
- However, because political news is lumpy and unpredictable, a **new flare-up** (additional Trump comments, DHS fallout, follow-on coverage) could just as easily create a renewed spike. Hence I keep substantial probability on “Increases” and “Doesn’t change.”

Overall, the outside view modestly favors **Decreases**, with “Doesn’t change” still quite plausible given the ±3 band and the possibility that attention stabilizes at a low level.

---

Outside view calibration:

- With no direct Trend values, I anchor to a broad, uncertainty-aware distribution typical for short-horizon Google Trends direction questions:
  - “Doesn’t change” often lands as the **modal** outcome due to small movements and the ±3 tolerance band, but it is not dominant because low-volume political terms can be noisy and news shocks are common.
  - Between “Increases” and “Decreases,” I apply a **slight tilt toward Decreases** because the contextual outview pattern for post-controversy attention is mean reversion/decay.
- I also account for “upset” risk: unexpected events can flip the direction within a week, so I avoid extreme probabilities.

Outside View Prediction:
- Increases: 25%  
- Doesn’t change: 40%  
- Decreases: 35%
