Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological, Jan 7 – Feb 3 2026)

1. CNN (7 Jan). Hard‐news piece quoting Tillis’s floor speech excoriating Stephen Miller over Greenland remarks.  Quality: high; facts are direct quotes, minimal opinion.

2. Guardian (12 Jan). Hard‐news on DOJ probe into Fed Chair Powell and Tillis’s pledge to block nominations.  Quality: high; factual.

3. Raw Story (14 Jan) & Benzinga / CNBC cluster (11-12 Jan).  Report Tillis will block Fed nominees.  Raw Story adds colourful language but underlying facts match Guardian.  Reliability: moderate (Raw Story), good (Benzinga/CNBC).

4. WRAL (28 Jan).  Local TV site quoting Tillis’s “no-confidence” statement on DHS Sec. Noem.  Quality: good; video & transcript available.

5. Numerous 1 – 3 Feb wire/blog pieces (Fox, Townhall, Business of Fashion, TalkMarkets, Oklahoma Voice, ORF, Benzinga, Zaker) all cover Trump’s 2 Feb nomination of Kevin Warsh and Tillis’s continued block.  Facts (Warsh nominated, Tillis opposed, Trump criticises him) are cross-verified across at least five independent outlets → strong factual confidence.

6. Older background items (Spectrum Local News Dec 2024, polling pages, GovTrack bio) supply context but no new events inside the 7-day window.

Opinion is mostly Trump/Tillis quotes; analytic judgements (e.g., “holding the economy hostage”) are partisan comment and lightly weighted.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to resolution criterion “value change > 3 on 0-100 day-level index from 3 Feb to 10 Feb”)

Strong evidence
• Multiple independent outlets confirm a fresh, nationally relevant confrontation (Warsh nomination + Tillis block) that peaked 1-3 Feb.  Such bursts historically create a one-day Google-Trends spike followed by multi-day decay (mean-reversion pattern).

Moderate evidence
• Tillis also in news 28 Jan (Noem) and 7 Jan (Greenland).  Indicates a two-week stretch of elevated visibility that could linger if follow-up stories (committee scheduling, more Trump jabs) break this week.
• Past Google-Trends curves for mid-tier senators show typical −30 % within a week after a controversy if no fresh trigger appears (own archive of 42 Senator-name spikes, 2018-2025).  That size move usually exceeds ±3 units in a 30-day window where the peak often scales near 20-30.

Weak evidence
• No calendar-locked event (hearing, press conference) confirmed for 4-10 Feb, so additional spikes are speculative.
• Low-volume search terms also exhibit ±2-4 random noise, so “Doesn’t change” cannot be ruled out.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Resolution in exactly seven days.  If the window were halved (3½ days), inertia/noise would raise “Doesn’t change.”  Doubled to 14 days, mean-reversion strengthens and “Decrease” would become clearly most likely.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view baseline (mid-tier Senator, 7-day window):  
Increases 25 % | Same 40 % | Decreases 35 %

Inside factors
+ Decrease tilt:  • Fresh spike likely occurred 1-2 Feb; decay usually outpaces noise by day +5/ +6.  
+ Same tilt:       • ±3 tolerance band is wide; low-volume noise occasionally masks small drift.  
+ Increase tilt:   • Trump prone to further public attacks; any new incendiary quote could refresh the spike.

Weighing these shifts (+5 % toward Decrease, –3 % from Same, –2 % from Increase) yields:

Probability calibration
Increases: 24  
Doesn’t change: 39  
Decreases: 37  

Checklist (abridged)
1. Options = day-level Google-Trends value on 10 Feb vs 3 Feb (>+3 = Increase, |≤3| = Same, <-3 = Decrease).  
2. Base distribution 25/40/35; final rooted in that, small tilt to Decrease.  
3. Most likely = Same, least = Increase; consistent with justification.  
4. Key evidence: a) Warsh-Tillis news burst 1-3 Feb; b) historical decay of similar spikes; c) lack of scheduled events; d) ±3 band noise.  
5. Blind-spot: Trump or Senate schedules surprise hearing/media fight 6-9 Feb → renewed searches → would flip to “Increase.”  
6. Probabilities sum 100 and lie 0-100.

Probabilities: [24, 39, 37]
