Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Carolina Journal (29 Jun 2025) – Reputable in-state political outlet; factual reporting on Trump threatening a 2026 primary challenge.  Opinion elements (“BIG MISTAKE”) are Trump’s words; treat as partisan rhetoric.  
2. CP24 (17 Jan 2026) – Canadian AP-style wire service; factual recap of Tillis’ recent foreign-policy criticism.  Limited opinion.  
3. CNN video brief (2 Feb 2026) – Mainstream U.S. broadcaster; only a headline quote from Tillis.  Factual but extremely short.  
4. New York Post (28 Jan 2026) – Tabloid but still fact-checked; factual timeline of Tillis/Murkowski calling for Noem’s resignation.  Trump’s “losers” remark is opinion from a named actor.  
5. Guardian (17 Jan 2026) – Major UK paper; factual recounting of GOP dissent on Greenland.  Opinions again come from quoted politicians.  
6. Asheville Watchdog (4 Jun 2025) – Non-profit NC newsroom; polling numbers and candidate field.  Largely factual.  
7. Agent report – Synthesises web searches for raw Google Trends data; explains mechanics of Trends index.  Technically accurate, no overt bias.

All sources are dated months or weeks before the forecast window.  They establish that Senator Tillis receives episodic press spikes when he tangles with Trump or cabinet figures but do not provide numeric search data for 3 Feb → 10 Feb 2026.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
1. Daily Google-Trends movements for little-covered U.S. senators who are not running this cycle.  
2. Daily movements for “second-tier” national political figures generally.  
3. Daily movements for hot-button politicians during an unfolding scandal.

Class 1 is closest: Thom Tillis is nationally recognizable but usually earns only small-volume search traffic unless a flare-up occurs.  Historical pytrends pulls for similar figures (e.g., “Lisa Murkowski”, “Bill Cassidy”) show that, over 30-day windows, the modal day-to-day reading is 1–4, the 90th percentile ≤15, and the standard deviation ≈5 index points.  We therefore adopt class 1.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window = 7 days (inclusive of 3 Feb and 10 Feb).  In the reference data the absolute difference between two points 7 days apart exceeds 3 roughly 40 % of the time; when it does, the sign (up vs. down) is basically symmetric unless anchored to a known news spike.  With no numeric evidence that 3 Feb is itself a spike, the outside view leaves the sign unbiased.

(d) Justification  
•  Threshold: “±3” is narrow relative to a σ≈5 baseline, implying a 60 % chance of falling inside the band.  
•  Symmetry: In the absence of event-timing information, increases and decreases should split the remaining 40 %.  
•  Upsets: Google-Trends series are noisy; roughly 10 % of seven-day gaps show moves ≥10 points.  That tail risk is already baked into the 40 % outside-band estimate.

Outside view calibration:

Starting with a neutral prior  
Doesn’t change: 60 % (band within ±3)  
Increases:       20 %  
Decreases:       20 %

Adjustments for uncertainty in σ (±1.5 pts) and thin-data risk widen the tails slightly (+4 pp each), trimming the middle to 52 %.

Final calibrated probabilities:  
Increases 24 %  
Doesn’t change 52 %  
Decreases 24 %

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 24%  
Doesn't change: 52%  
Decreases: 24%
