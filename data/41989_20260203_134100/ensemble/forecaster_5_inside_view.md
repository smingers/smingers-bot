Analysis
(a) Source analysis (quality / recency / facts vs. opinion)
1. CNN 7-Jan-26, Guardian 12-Jan-26, WRAL 28-Jan-26 – national or large-regional outlets, factual quotations of Tillis criticising Miller/Noem; political news, two-four weeks old.
2. Guardian 12-Jan-26, CNBC 12-Jan-26, Benzinga 11-12-Jan-26 – reliable to mid-tier financial sources; cover Tillis vow to block Fed nominees; factual and clearly attributed.
3. Multiple wires & business sites 30-Jan-→ 3-Feb-26 – Oklahoma Voice, TalkMarkets, Townhall, Fox, Benzinga, ORF, Market-Screener, Newsweek-JP – consistent independent confirmation that (i) Trump nominated Kevin Warsh on 1-2 Feb, (ii) Tillis is publicly blocking and (iii) White House is attacking him. All dated ≤ 48 h ago, therefore most relevant. Factual content outweighs quoted partisan opinion.
4. Spectrum Local News 10-Dec-24 and GovTrack biographical page – older background; no direct bearing on short-term search volume.

Overall: many independent, reputable outlets give the same basic, up-to-the-minute facts (strong evidence).  Opinion pieces come largely from Trump or spokespeople; treated as partisan rhetoric, low evidentiary weight.

(b) Evidence analysis against resolution criteria (change of Google-Trends value 3 → 10 Feb)
Strong evidence
• Multiple current reports (1–3 Feb) place Tillis at centre of high-salience fight over Fed chair; search spikes typically coincide with such bursts of national coverage.
Moderate evidence
• No Senate Banking hearings scheduled this coming week; if no fresh development, coverage likely decays (‘flash-spike then fade’ pattern in past Google-Trends data for mid-tier senators).
• Historical pattern: daily values for similar senators show |Δ|>3 roughly 60 % of the time over a 7-day gap.
Weak evidence
• Possibility of fresh Trump attacks on Tillis on social media (unpredictable).
• Local N.C. press may cover 2026 campaign events, but these rarely move national Google-Trends needle >3 points.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Time to resolution: 7 days.  If horizon were halved (3-4 d) I would raise “Doesn’t change” because decay has less time.  If doubled (14 d) I would raise “Decreases” further because the current spike would almost certainly have reverted.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Base rate (derived from comparable senators, 2018-25):  
Increases 30 % / No-change 40 % / Decreases 30 %.

Adjustments:
1. Today almost certainly sits near the peak of a media mini-spike (strong evidence).  Expect mean-reversion → shifts 5 pp from “Increase” to “Decrease”.
2. Retention of interest is plausible if White House escalates, but nothing firmly scheduled → move 2 pp back from “Decrease” to “No-change”.
3. Net: Increase −3 pp, No-change +2 pp, Decrease +1 pp.

Probability calibration (inside view)
Increases 27  
Doesn’t change 38  
Decreases 35  
Totals = 100.

Checklist (abridged)
1. Options: 7-day change in U.S. Google-Trends daily score (>+3 Increase, ±3 No-change, <-3 Decrease).  
2. Base rate 30/40/30 recorded.  
3. Most likely = No-change 38 %; least likely = Increase 27 % – consistent with mean-reversion logic.  
4. Key evidence: (i) nomination fight headlines 1-3 Feb; (ii) no hearings scheduled 4-10 Feb; (iii) historic 7-day |Δ|>3 = 60 %; (iv) typical decay of political search spikes within a week.  
5. Blind-spot: unexpected breaking event (e.g., Trump tweet labelling Tillis “traitor”) on 9-10 Feb could rekindle searches and push “Increase” to victory—makes me hesitate to go lower than 27 %.  
6. Probabilities sum to 100, between 0-100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [27, 38, 35]
