## Polling Data:

**Tillis's Standing:**
- May poll by Carolina Journal: Tillis has the lowest net image in the poll at 26% favorability

# Summary of Article: "Sen. Thom Tillis takes on the White House, but not Trump"

**Source:** CP24  
**Date:** January 17, 2026

## Key Facts and Context:

- **Thom Tillis** is a two-term Republican Senator from North Carolina who is not seeking reelection and is in his final year in Washington.

- Tillis is 65 years old and previously served as speaker of North Carolina's House of Representatives from 2011 to 2015.

- He is one of only two Republicans (along with Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski) who participated in a congressional delegation to Denmark this week while Trump threatens to seize Greenland.

- Tillis was one of only two Senate Republicans who voted against Trump's tax and spending cuts package last summer.

## Recent Actions and Statements:

- Tillis criticized Trump's advisers from the Senate floor, calling them out for "stoking a potential U.S. military takeover in Greenland," stating "I'm sick of stupid."

- He supported displaying a plaque honoring police who defended the Capitol on January 6, 2021.

- He questioned Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem's immediate response to a fatal shooting in Minneapolis.

- On the Jan. 6 anniversary, Tillis called it "one of the worst days in my 11 years in the U.S. Senate" and criticized Trump's pardons of Jan. 6 defendants who attacked police, though he blamed advisers rather than Trump directly.

## Tillis's Positioning:

- Tillis repeatedly expresses support for Trump, stating "I really want this president to be very, very successful."

- He focuses his criticism primarily on White House aides rather than Trump himself, questioning whether Trump is receiving good advice.

- He frames his approach from a business perspective based on his 25 years in the private sector.

- Last summer, Trump was more critical, accusing Tillis of being a "talker and complainer, NOT A DOER" after Tillis opposed the tax package.

## Political Context:

- The article notes that Tillis won elections in "one of the most politically competitive states."

- Tillis stated he wants to "create a better environment for Republicans to win" heading into the midterms.

- The White House did not respond to a request for comment on Tillis's assessment of Trump's aides.

# Summary of Article: "Republican dissent as key figures warn Trump against Greenland pursuit"

**Source:** The Guardian  
**Date:** January 17, 2026  
**Author:** Chris Stein

## Key Facts and Statements:

**Congressional Republican Opposition:**
- North Carolina Senator **Thom Tillis** spoke on the Senate floor Wednesday, calling the idea of taking Greenland "absurd." He stated: "The thought of the United States taking the position that we would take Greenland, an independent territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, is absurd."
- Tillis noted that Greenlanders "were actually very, very pro-American and very, very pro American presence" until recent times.

**Other Republican Criticism:**
- Nebraska Congressman **Don Bacon** told the Omaha World-Herald: "If he went through with the threats, I think it would be the end of his presidency...Republicans aren't going to tolerate this and he's going to have to back off."
- Former Senate Republican leader **Mitch McConnell** compared potential seizure of Greenland to Biden's 2021 Afghanistan withdrawal, warning it would amount to "incinerating the hard-won trust of loyal allies in exchange for no meaningful change in US access to the Arctic."
- Alaska Senator **Lisa Murkowski** said on Friday during a visit to Copenhagen: "This senator from Alaska does not think it is a good idea...Greenland needs to be viewed as our ally, not as an asset."
- Ohio Congressman **Mike Turner** wrote on X about the importance of transatlantic relationships and respecting Danish and Greenlander sovereignty.
- Louisiana Senator **John Kennedy** told CNN: "To invade Greenland and attack its sovereignty, a fellow Nato country, would be weapons-grade stupid. President Trump is not weapons-grade stupid."

**Context:**
- Polling shows "an overwhelming majority of Americans oppose taking control of the island"
- Denmark has warned that an invasion would "spell the end of Nato"
- Trump's interest in Greenland reintensified after the US raid that captured Venezuelan president Nicolás Maduro

Query: Google Trends thom tillis daily January-February 2026 volatility analysis
The original assignment is to quantify day-to-day volatility in U.S. Google search interest for the term “Thom Tillis” from 1 January through 29 February 2026.  To do that one needs the complete 60-row daily index that Google Trends produces for custom ranges shorter than 90 days.  The new documents located in this search round add useful context about what might have driven search spikes, but they still do not supply the numeric series itself.

1. What the new results add  
• Ballotpedia’s overview of the 2026 North Carolina Senate race (Ballotpedia, 5 Jan 2026) confirms Senator Tillis’ retirement announcement and summarises the crowded primary calendar. This corroborates the “retirement” news hook that had already been placed on the early-January timeline.  
• The New York Times polling tracker dated 16 Jan 2026 (NYTimes, 16 Jan 2026) documents the national rollout of its first NC-Senate poll, a high-traffic event that almost certainly produced a mid-January search surge.  
• A PBS NC “State Lines” broadcast on 30 Jan 2026 (PBS, 30 Jan 2026) shows that Tillis’ remarks about DHS Secretary Kristi Noem dominated state political coverage at month-end—another potential driver of Google interest.  
• None of these pages contain either (a) a Google Trends widget, (b) a screenshot from trends.google.com, or (c) a link to a CSV/JSON export of the daily index, nor do the ancillary results from NBC News, Snopes, or the New York Post. They therefore do not close the core data gap.

2. Status of ingredients required for a volatility calculation  
Already available:  
• A chronology of at least a dozen discrete news events between 1 Jan and 29 Feb 2026, now enriched with (i) Tillis’ retirement statement (early Jan), (ii) NYT poll publication (16 Jan), (iii) public feud over ICE shooting (late Jan–early Feb), and (iv) run-up to the 3 Mar primary.  
• A statistical template (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, largest single-day change, five-day rolling σ, etc.).  

Still missing:  
• The day-level Google Trends index values for “Thom Tillis” in the United States for 2026-01-01 → 2026-02-29. Without those 60 numbers no quantitative measure—neither standard deviation nor coefficient of variation—can be computed.

3. Why the numeric data remain elusive  
Google Trends shows weekly data by default. Daily granularity only appears when the user selects a window shorter than 90 days inside the web interface or calls an authenticated endpoint. None of the surfaced web pages appear to have gone through that step and then exported the file. No GitHub or Kaggle repository surfaced that contains a pytrends or gtrendsR scrape of the term. The InLibra and GitHub documents retrieved in this round are unrelated to search-interest data.

4. Implications for the requested “volatility analysis”  
• Qualitative insight: The news-event timeline now strongly suggests a choppy profile—clustered media attention in mid-January (NYT poll) and end-January (ICE shooting criticism) followed by campaign-related chatter in February—but this remains an inference.  
• Quantitative gap: Because the 0–100 daily index series is still not in hand, any numerical statement about volatility (σ, CV, range, maximum single-day jump) would be speculative and academically unsound.

5. Recommended next retrieval actions  
The most efficient path is still to pull the data directly from Google Trends or a third-party API cache.  New targeted queries that have not yet been tried should focus on developer forums and data-science repositories where the CSV may have been shared, or on cached API responses.  Examples:</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?

Format you answer as below:
