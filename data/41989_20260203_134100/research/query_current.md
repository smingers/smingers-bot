Analysis:
The Google Trends value for “thom tillis” will move noticeably only if something pushes the senator into broader headlines over the next seven days.  Relevant catalysts include:
• Introduction or key vote on high-profile legislation.
• A publicized scandal, ethics investigation, or legal action.
• Health issues, retirement announcement, or 2026 reelection plans.
• Major media appearances (Sunday shows, viral interview, debate).
• In-state events that gain national pickup (e.g., hurricane response, factory groundbreaking with president).
Therefore, the most useful articles are those that (a) report imminent or breaking news about Thom Tillis, (b) preview scheduled events or floor action in Congress this week, and (c) flag rumors or scoops that could erupt shortly.  I will search broadly on the open web, then zero in on dedicated news coverage, and finally ask an AI news assistant to surface any forthcoming or under-the-radar items specifically dated for Feb 3-10 2026.
