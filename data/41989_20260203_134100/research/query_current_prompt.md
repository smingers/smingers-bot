The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “thom tillis” change between 2026-02-03 and 2026-02-10 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “thom tillis” at the time of writing this question (Feb 1, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 24; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=thom%20tillis&date=2026-01-02%202026-02-01).

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write a series of search queries that will be used to find current information/news articles relevant to the question. For each query, indicate whether you wish to utilize google, google news, or AskNews to retrieve information.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search. Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For AskNews:
Your query for AskNews will be processed more naturally, so feel free to write a sentence-long query in natural language. Avoid using ambiguous acronyms. Specify relevant criteria (e.g., geography, industry, time period) to ensure the correct scope. If desired, you can indicate multiple kinds of news articles you're looking for in your query. Keep your query to a maximum of two sentences. Important note: Do not prefix your query with 'AskNews:' or something similar. Please add the word 'AskNews' enclosed in brackets at the end of the query, referring closely to the example below.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () (NOT curly brackets, NOT square brackets [], you need to use normal brackets ()) **on the same line as and after** the query, applicable for Google, Google News and AskNews. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for AskNews.

Use the following verification checklist:
1. One query for google?
2. One query for google news?
3. One query for AskNews?
4. All queries followed by either (Google), (Google News) or (AskNews) in brackets () on the same line as the query?
