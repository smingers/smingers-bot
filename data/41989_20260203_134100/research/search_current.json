Thom Tillis kicks off a tough re-election fight\"\n\n**Source:** Spectrum Local News\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n1. **Campaign Launch:** Republican Sen. Thom Tillis is officially kicking off his 2026 re-election campaign this week with a fundraiser with Senate Republicans on Wednesday.\n\n2. **Previous Statement on Running:** Tillis told Spectrum News in 2019 that he was \"unlikely\" to run for a third term, but is now proceeding with a re-election campaign.\n\n3. **Race Significance:** The race is expected to be one of the most closely watched and expensive races in the country during the 2026 midterms. Democrats view North Carolina as a critical path to potentially taking back the U.S. Senate.\n\n4. **Expected Democratic Investment:** Democrats will likely invest tens of millions of dollars trying to flip the seat.\n\n5. **Potential Democratic Challengers:** No Democrat is officially in the race yet, but outgoing Rep. Wiley Nickel has expressed interest. Outgoing Gov. Roy Cooper has been floated as a notable potential candidate.\n\n6. **Primary Challenge Concerns:** Tillis could face a Republican primary challenge. Hardline Republicans have criticized him for not being conservative enough due to his votes supporting bipartisan legislation during Joe Biden's presidency.\n\n7. **NCGOP Censure:** The North Carolina GOP censured Tillis last year for some of his votes, including his work to enshrine protections for same-sex and interracial marriages in federal law.\n\n8. **Potential Republican Primary Challengers:** Two names to watch include N.C. Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson and Lara Trump (President-elect Donald Trump's daughter-in-law). No Republican besides Tillis has officially jumped into the race.\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n**Western Carolina University politics Professor Chris Cooper:** \"Thom Tillis is very good at figuring out where the levers of power are and how best to use them. Not just for his career but for his constituents. So he has put himself in a power position in the U.S. Senate, and the way to be in a power position is not to be in the right flank but to be somewhere in the middle. And that's where Thom Tillis has been.\"\n\n**Sen. Thom Tillis (direct quote):** \"If I can't defend myself in a primary after being a two-term member, then I'm not very good at my job. The real question is how well are we going to govern. How well are going to come in and support President Trump and fulfill the promises that we've made. If we don't do that, that's going to be very, very difficult for anybody in the 2026 cycle to be successful, me or anybody else.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.tillis.senate.gov/\">\n## Summary of Article\n\n**Disclaimer:** This appears to be a standard contact/constituent services page from Senator Thom Tillis's official Senate website rather than a news article.

This came in response to Republican Senator Thom Tillis, who issued a 'red line' condition: no new Fed chair nominee would be supported unless the investigation into Powell was fully resolved. Trump\u2019s stance deepened tensions between the White House and the Federal Reserve, casting uncertainty over the transition of Fed leadership. Just days earlier, Trump had nominated Kevin Warsh as Powell\u2019s successor. However, with Tillis holding significant influence on the Senate Banking Committee\u2014composed of 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats\u2014a 12-12 deadlock is possible if Democrats unite against Warsh, potentially blocking the nomination before full Senate consideration. The market fears this leadership vacuum could destabilize financial markets. The conflict centers on the costly and lengthy renovation of the Fed\u2019s Washington headquarters, which Trump has labeled as either gross incompetence or potential theft and kickbacks. Powell, who has been under criminal investigation since January 11, 2026, claims the probe is politically motivated, asserting the Fed\u2019s independence in setting interest rates based on public interest, not presidential pressure. According to CNBC, the Fed has not yet complied with a grand jury subpoena as part of the investigation. Powell\u2019s term ends in May 2026, and the battle over central bank independence versus political accountability is expected to peak in the final months of his tenure.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 03:15 AM\nSource:[app.myzaker.com](http://app.myzaker.com/news/article.php?pk=69815bea8e9f0921420bf1ad)\n\n**Trump to nominate former Fed governor to replace Powell as chair**\nPresident Donald Trump announced on February 2, 2026, his nomination of Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve Board governor (2006\u20132011) and visiting scholar at Stanford\u2019s Hoover Institution, to succeed Jerome Powell as Chair of the Federal Reserve after Powell\u2019s term ends in May 2026. Trump praised Warsh on Truth Social, calling him 'one of the GREAT Fed Chairmen, maybe the best,' and noting he is 'central casting' and 'will never let you down.' However, the nomination faces significant opposition in the Senate, particularly from Republican Senator Thom Tillis of North Carolina, who will oppose the nomination unless the Department of Justice\u2019s ongoing criminal investigation into Powell\u2014specifically allegations that Powell lied to Congress about renovation costs at the Fed\u2019s Washington, D.C., headquarters\u2014is fully resolved and transparent. Tillis emphasized that protecting the Fed\u2019s independence from political interference is 'non-negotiable.' Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren also condemned the nomination, urging Republicans to reject it and calling Trump\u2019s actions a 'witch hunt.' Trump has publicly threatened to fire Powell if he does not lower interest rates more aggressively, and Powell has confirmed he received a federal grand jury subpoena in January 2026 related to the investigation. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche stated that the timing of Trump\u2019s nomination would not influence the DOJ probe. Notably, Trump has not asked Warsh for a commitment to lower interest rates, stating it would be 'inappropriate' to do so. The nomination is expected to face a tight vote, as Trump lacks the necessary majority in the Senate Banking Committee if all Democrats oppose and Tillis remains opposed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:30 PM\nSource:[Oklahoma Voice](https://oklahomavoice.com/2026/02/02/repub/trump-to-nominate-former-fed-governor-to-replace-powell-as-chair/)\n\n**Daily Market Outlook - Monday, Feb. 2**\nOn Monday, February 2, 2026, financial markets experienced heightened volatility following a sharp reversal from January's strong gains. Gold dropped 6.3% from nearly $5,600 to below $4,600 an ounce, while silver plunged 12% after a 26% nosedive on Friday\u2014the steepest two-day decline since early April. Equity markets declined globally: the MSCI All Country World Index fell 0.4%, Asia\u2019s benchmark dropped 2%, South Korea\u2019s Kospi plunged 4%, and Nasdaq 100 futures fell over 1%. Crude oil prices slid 6.3%. The sell-off followed a period of record stock highs and strong gains in precious metals, driven by massive AI investments. Investors are reassessing valuations and bracing for potential shifts in monetary policy, particularly after President Trump confirmed Kevin Warsh as his pick for Federal Reserve Chair. Warsh, seen as hawkish, aligns with Trump\u2019s push for lower interest rates, though Republican Senator Thom Tillis is blocking appointments due to a DoJ investigation, delaying Warsh\u2019s confirmation and extending Jerome Powell\u2019s tenure. Uncertainty around Fed independence and policy direction continues to weigh on the dollar, despite expectations of rate cuts. Key economic data this week include the January jobs report (expected to show 50,000 new jobs, unemployment at 4.4%, and hourly earnings unchanged), the JOLTS report, ADP employment report, ISM manufacturing and services indices, and the University of Michigan consumer sentiment survey (forecasted to decline to 54.3 from 56.4). Central banks including the ECB, BoE, and RBA are expected to hold rates steady. In corporate earnings, major tech firms like Alphabet, Amazon, Palantir, AMD, and Qualcomm are reporting, alongside healthcare giants Eli Lilly, AbbVie, Novartis, and Novo Nordisk, and consumer staples like PepsiCo, Disney, and Uber. Japanese firms include Toyota, Sony, and Tokyo Electron. Global developments include OPEC+ maintaining oil output amid Iran tensions, the Bank of Japan signaling urgency for rate hikes, and China\u2019s BYD leading an EV selloff after weak January sales. Bitcoin fell below $80,000, signaling market confidence issues. FX options expiries at key levels (e.g., EUR/USD at 1.1800, 1.1925, 1.2000) are expected to influence trading. CFTC data shows equity fund speculators increased net short S&P 500 CME positions to 420,688 contracts, while managers increased net longs to 909,993. Speculators reduced net shorts in 5-year Treasuries but increased net shorts in 10-year and UltraBond Treasuries. The euro has a net long position of 132,134 contracts, while the yen and Swiss franc remain net short. Bitcoin\u2019s net long position stands at 690 contracts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:15 PM\nSource:[TalkMarkets - Stocks](https://talkmarkets.com/content/currenciesforex/daily-market-outlook-monday-feb-2?post=554269)\n\n**Leavitt Blasts This GOP Senator For Holding the Economy Hostage, Vowing to Oppose Kevin Warsh Nomination**\nPress Secretary Karoline Leavitt strongly criticized Senate Majority Leader Thom Tillis, a Republican from North Carolina, for opposing President Trump's nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve chairman. Tillis stated he would withhold support until the Department of Justice (DOJ) completes its investigation into current Fed Chair Jerome Powell, asserting that 'protecting the independence of the Federal Reserve from political interference or legal intimidation is non-negotiable.' Leavitt responded by accusing Tillis of 'holding the entire country and our economy hostage' over a DOJ probe that she described as legitimate and ongoing. She emphasized that Powell is set to leave office in May, making the timing of the opposition questionable. Leavitt highlighted President Trump's achievement in reducing the core annualized inflation rate to 1.4 percent from a previous high of 9 percent, arguing that Trump\u2019s economic policies are effective and that lowering interest rates is essential. She affirmed Warsh as a 'highly qualified and distinguished economist' and pledged the White House would work with the Senate to confirm him quickly. Tillis reiterated his position on X, stating he would oppose any Fed nominee until the DOJ inquiry is fully and transparently resolved, while acknowledging Warsh\u2019s qualifications but criticizing the DOJ\u2019s criminal investigation into Powell\u2019s committee testimony as lacking criminal intent.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 03:30 PM\nSource:[Townhall](https://townhall.com/tipsheet/dmitri-bolt/2026/02/02/leavitt-blasts-thom-tillis-for-opposing-fed-chair-pick-n2670497)\n\n**Donald Trump to Nominate Kevin Warsh as US Federal Reserve Chair**\nDonald Trump is expected to nominate Kevin Warsh, a former Federal Reserve governor and current Stanford lecturer, as the next Chair of the US Federal Reserve, signaling a move to consolidate presidential control over the central bank. Warsh, who served as a Fed governor from 2006 to 2011 during the global financial crisis and was its G20 representative, has long been a monetary policy hawk but has recently aligned with Trump\u2019s push for lower interest rates. His nomination, anticipated on February 2, 2026, would replace Jerome Powell, whose tenure as chair ends in May 2026. Powell, first appointed by Trump in 2018, has defied the president\u2019s repeated demands to cut rates, leading to sustained political conflict. The Financial Times and Polymarket confirmed the expected nomination, with Warsh\u2019s odds rising to 94% on the prediction site. Markets reacted swiftly: the US dollar index rose 0.4%, and gold prices dropped 4% to $5,168 per ounce. Economists like Stephen Brown of Capital Economics describe Warsh as a 'relatively safe choice' due to his credibility and long-standing views on a smaller balance sheet, though his support for AI-driven inflation control and regulatory optimism may increase long-term bond yields. The nomination comes amid heightened political tensions, including a DOJ criminal investigation into Powell over Fed headquarters renovations, which Powell denies. Republican Senator Thom Tillis has pledged to block Warsh\u2019s nomination due to the investigation. Despite Wall Street\u2019s support for Fed independence\u2014evidenced by stock drops during prior firing rumors\u2014Trump\u2019s attacks have eroded trust among business leaders and even some Republicans. Warsh\u2019s confirmation in the Senate remains uncertain due to this distrust, despite his qualifications.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 12:01 PM\nSource:[The Business of Fashion](https://www.businessoffashion.com/news/beauty/donald-trump-kevin-warsh-federal-reserve-jane-lauder/)\n\n**The Week Ahead: Tech Earnings And Jobs Report Highlight Busy Market Week**\nPresident Trump announced on Friday, February 1, 2026, the nomination of Kevin Warsh, a 55-year-old former Federal Reserve governor, as the next Fed chair, prompting a 0.8% rise in the U.S. dollar. Warsh, known for his hawkish stance on inflation during his prior Fed tenure, is expected to face Senate confirmation challenges, particularly from Senator Thom Tillis, who has withheld support until the Justice Department resolves its investigation into current Fed Chair Jerome Powell. The Federal Reserve maintained unchanged interest rates despite signs of a weakening labor market, with the January jobs report forecasting 65,000 new jobs and a stable unemployment rate at 4.4%. This follows December\u2019s weaker job growth of 50,000, and a broader trend of declining employment gains in 2025 (584,000) compared to 2024 (2 million). Major tech earnings are due this week, including Alphabet, Amazon, AMD, Palantir, and Disney, with expectations of increased AI investment spending. Meta rose 8.8% after raising AI spending targets, while Microsoft fell 7.6% on similar news. The software sector saw pressure after SAP and ServiceNow results raised concerns about AI disruption. Gold dropped over 9%, silver lost more than 28%, and platinum declined 19% in a broad precious metals sell-off. Oil prices rose approximately 7% due to escalating tensions over potential U.S. military action in Iran and fears of Strait of Hormuz disruptions.

Leavitt criticized Tillis for opposing the nomination over a DOJ probe into Powell\u2019s testimony regarding a $2.5 billion renovation of the Fed\u2019s headquarters, stating that a U.S. senator should not use national economic stability as leverage for political disagreements. She praised Warsh as a 'highly qualified and distinguished economist with a very exceptional resume.' Tillis acknowledged Warsh\u2019s qualifications but argued the DOJ investigation\u2014based on testimony he claims lacked criminal intent\u2014must be resolved transparently before any confirmation. The investigation, though unrelated to Powell\u2019s official duties, has drawn bipartisan concern that it serves as political pressure to force Powell to lower interest rates, a move Trump has repeatedly demanded. Powell, who has led the Fed since 2017, has resisted such pressure to preserve the central bank\u2019s independence in managing inflation and employment, a mission the Fed maintains is separate from political influence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 06:11 PM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/media/leavitt-accuses-sen-tillis-holding-us-economy-hostage-over-fed-nomination-dispute)\n\n**The Week Ahead: Tech Earnings and Jobs Report Highlight Busy Market Week**\nPresident Trump announced the nomination of Kevin Warsh, a 55-year-old former Federal Reserve governor, as the next Federal Reserve chair on Friday, February 1, 2026.

Trump stated, 'He is an excellent candidate, and I believe he could likely gain Democratic votes,' adding, 'There should be no problem with confirmation.' However, the process may face challenges: Republican Senator Thom Tillis, a key member of the Senate Banking Committee, declared he would oppose confirmation until the Department of Justice's investigation into current FRB Chair Jerome Powell is 'fully and transparently resolved.' Trump criticized Tillis as a 'obstructionist' on February 30, 2026, and said he was willing to wait for Warsh\u2019s confirmation until Tillis leaves the Senate. Trump also suggested Warsh could be confirmed even without Tillis\u2019s support, though he did not specify which Democratic senators might back him. When asked about expectations for Warsh on interest rates, Trump said, 'He will lower rates. You can see it in his TV interviews and statements. I hope he lowers rates, but he must do what he believes is right.' On whether Warsh had committed to rate cuts, Trump replied, 'He has not. Not because he couldn\u2019t, but because he chose not to.'\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 07:23 AM\nSource:[\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u65e5\u672c\u7248 \u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8](https://www.newsweekjapan.jp/headlines/business/2026/02/586066.php)\n\n**Republicans Aim to Block Warsh's Fed Chair Nomination**\nThe nomination of Kevin Warsh as the new head of the U.S. Federal Reserve by President Donald Trump has encountered unexpected resistance within the Republican Party. Republican Senator Thom Tillis announced he would block Warsh's confirmation in the Senate, stating he would oppose any Fed chair nominee until the Justice Department's investigation into incumbent Fed Chair Jerome Powell is 'fully and transparently' concluded. Tillis posted this on the social media platform X, emphasizing the functioning of the separation of powers, noting that a single senator can prevent what he described as the 'most powerful man on the planet' from undermining the Fed's credibility and independence. The investigation against Powell concerns alleged cost overruns during a renovation, which Powell has dismissed as a pretext for political pressure on monetary policy. The Republicans hold a narrow 13-to-11 majority in the Senate Banking Committee, meaning one dissenting vote can stall the process. Trump expressed frustration, calling Tillis a 'blocker.' Despite earlier confidence that Warsh would be confirmed, Trump stated Warsh is 'highly qualified' and could even win support from some Democrats. Trump expects Warsh to lower interest rates if confirmed, though he clarified that Warsh could not make such promises directly. The article was published on February 1, 2026, according to newsORF.at.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 06:58 AM\nSource:[newsORF.at](https://orf.at/stories/3418853/)\n\n**Trump says it would be inappropriate to ask Warsh if he'd cut rates**\nOn January 30, 2026, President Donald Trump announced his nomination of Kevin Warsh to lead the U.S. Federal Reserve following Jerome Powell's term ending in May. Trump stated it would be 'inappropriate' to directly ask Warsh whether he would support cutting interest rates, despite acknowledging Warsh's clear desire to do so. Trump emphasized Warsh's qualifications, calling him 'the perfect candidate,' the 'top student,' and the 'youngest person ever to serve on the Fed,' and praised his elite educational background. Although Warsh has a history of advocating for rate hikes (a 'hawkish' stance), Trump said he believes Warsh will act in line with the administration's goals. Trump expressed confidence in the Senate confirmation process, dismissing concerns raised by Republican Senator Thom Tillis, who pledged to block any Fed nominee until a Justice Department investigation into current Fed Chair Jerome Powell is fully resolved. Trump framed the nomination as a potential 'regime change' in monetary policy, aligning with the White House\u2019s push for greater executive control over interest rate decisions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 08:37 PM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/trump-says-it-would-be-inappropriate-to-ask-warsh-if-he-d-cut-rates-ce7e5bdcd18cf624)\n\n**Trump Confident in Warsh's Rate-Cutting Outlook, Calls Tillis a 'Blocker' on Confirmation**\nU.S. President Trump stated on January 30, 2026, that he is confident Kevin Warsh, whom he has nominated as the next Federal Reserve Chair, is open to interest rate cuts. Trump emphasized that questioning Warsh on whether he will cut rates is inappropriate, saying he wants 'pure and good' outcomes. He added that Warsh has expressed support for rate cuts, stating, 'He would want the same thing.' While Trump expressed no concern about Senate confirmation, he acknowledged that the process may be difficult. Senator Thom Tillis (North Carolina), a key Republican on the Senate Banking Committee, reiterated his previous stance that he will not support Warsh\u2019s nomination as long as the investigation into current Fed Chair Powell continues. In response, Trump called Tillis a 'blocker' who wants to delay confirmation, saying, 'If he won\u2019t approve, we\u2019ll just wait until someone who will approves.' Tillis is not seeking re-election in the 2026 midterm elections.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 06:24 PM\nSource:[\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u65e5\u672c\u7248 \u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8](https://www.newsweekjapan.jp/headlines/world/2026/01/586029.php)\n\n**'Absurd': Senate Republican says Trump 'crossing a line' in furious floor speech**\nU.S. Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC), who is retiring at the end of the year, delivered a floor speech on January 14, 2026, condemning President Donald Trump's latest actions, which he said threaten both the economy and the international order. Tillis called Trump's threats to invade and annex Greenland 'absurd' and questioned the rationale behind such a move, stating, 'Whoever told the president that this is a viable path? It doesn't make sense.' He also criticized the Trump administration's criminal probe into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, accusing it of being a pretextual legal threat aimed at forcing the Fed to cut interest rates. Tillis asserted that the odds of Powell being convicted are 'virtually impossible' and noted that financial markets remained stable partly because many members of Congress, including himself, have spoken out against the probe. As a result, Tillis threatened to block all new Federal Reserve nominees until the investigation is resolved.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 09:04 PM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/thom-tillis-2674892808/)\n\n**Republican Sen. Thom Tillis vows to block Trump's Fed nominees following Powell probe**\nRepublican Senator Thom Tillis (R-N.C.) announced he will block any nominee proposed by President Donald Trump for the Federal Reserve, including the upcoming chair, due to a Justice Department investigation into Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell for potential perjury. Tillis stated that the investigation undermines the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice, and he will oppose all Fed nominations until the matter is resolved. His opposition is significant because the Senate Banking Committee has 13 Republicans and 11 Democrats, meaning one Republican defection could create a stalemate. Tillis, who generally supports Trump, previously broke with him on the One Big Beautiful Bill. Powell, whose chairmanship expires in May 2026, has not yet decided whether to remain as a governor until 2028. He released a statement asserting the investigation is a pretext to give Trump control over the Fed. Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) echoed criticism, accusing Trump of attempting to install a 'sock puppet' to lower interest rates for his benefit. The White House has narrowed the chair candidate pool to five, with a nominee expected this month. The investigation, led by U.S. Attorney Jeanine Pirro\u2014a Trump confidant\u2014has intensified political tensions over the Fed\u2019s independence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 12, 2026 12:50 PM\nSource:[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/12/republican-sen-thom-tillis-vows-to-block-trumps-fed-nominees-following-powell-probe.html)\n\n**Senator Thom Tillis Vows to Block Fed Nominations Amid DOJ Pressure on Powell**\nSenator Thom Tillis (Republican, North Carolina) announced on January 11, 2026, that he would block the confirmation of all future Federal Reserve nominees, including the next Fed Chair, until legal issues surrounding the Trump Administration's actions against the Federal Reserve are fully resolved. This move follows the Department of Justice's issuance of a grand jury subpoena to the Federal Reserve on January 9, 2026, which alleges criminal charges related to former Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s testimony on a multi-year office renovation project. Tillis condemned the DOJ\u2019s actions as undermining the independence and credibility of both the Federal Reserve and the Department of Justice, stating, 'It is now the independence and credibility of the Department of Justice that are in question.' In response, Powell rejected the prosecution threat as a 'pretext,' asserting that the legal pressure stems from the Fed\u2019s decision to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions rather than presidential preferences. He emphasized that the Fed's independence is under threat and vowed to continue serving the public with integrity despite mounting threats. The standoff marks a pivotal moment for U.S. monetary policy, with Powell warning the conflict is about whether the Fed will operate based on economic evidence or succumb to political coercion. Market indicators reflect the tension: CME Group\u2019s FedWatch tool prices a 95% probability of a rate hold in January 2026. Stock indices closed higher on Friday, with SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY) rising 0.66% to $694.07 and Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) gaining 1.00% to $626.70.

The subpoenas, served on Friday, seek information related to Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s testimony about a multi-year renovation of the Fed\u2019s historic buildings and threaten a criminal indictment. Tillis criticized the administration\u2019s actions as an effort to undermine the independence of the Federal Reserve, calling the DOJ\u2019s conduct a threat to its credibility. In response, Powell called the threat of criminal charges 'unprecedented' and dismissed the focus on the renovation and his testimony as 'pretexts' for political pressure. He emphasized that the Fed\u2019s decisions are based on economic data, not presidential preferences, and reaffirmed his commitment to serving with integrity. The standoff marks a pivotal moment for the Fed\u2019s autonomy, with Tillis using Senate confirmation power as a legislative shield.

Trump hosted a 'thank you' lunch for Senate Republicans in the Rose Garden on October 21, 2025, where he acknowledged the construction noise, saying, 'You hear that sound? Oh, that's music to my ears. I love that sound,' and joking that it reminded him of his real estate career. He added, 'In this case, it reminds me of lack of money because I'm paying for it,' clarifying that no taxpayer funds will be used\u2014funding will come from private donors including Lockheed Martin and Google, plus an undisclosed portion of his own wealth. While Senate Majority Leader John Thune praised the White House makeover, and Sen. Lisa Murkowski acknowledged the ongoing jackhammering, Tillis, who did not attend the event due to returning from a funeral, called the timing 'bad.' Other Republicans present declined to criticize the optics. Sen. John Kennedy (R-LA) remarked, 'Construction is not in my job description,' highlighting the contrast between the renovation and the government shutdown.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 09:52 PM\nSource:[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/senate/3858979/thom-tillis-trump-shutdown-ballroom-renovations-timing-bad/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
