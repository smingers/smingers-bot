To do that one needs the complete 60-row daily index that Google Trends produces for custom ranges shorter than 90 days.  The new documents located in this search round add useful context about what might have driven search spikes, but they still do not supply the numeric series itself.\n\n1. What the new results add  \n\u2022 Ballotpedia\u2019s overview of the 2026 North Carolina Senate race (Ballotpedia, 5 Jan 2026) confirms Senator Tillis\u2019 retirement announcement and summarises the crowded primary calendar. This corroborates the \u201cretirement\u201d news hook that had already been placed on the early-January timeline.  \n\u2022 The New York Times polling tracker dated 16 Jan 2026 (NYTimes, 16 Jan 2026) documents the national rollout of its first NC-Senate poll, a high-traffic event that almost certainly produced a mid-January search surge.  \n\u2022 A PBS NC \u201cState Lines\u201d broadcast on 30 Jan 2026 (PBS, 30 Jan 2026) shows that Tillis\u2019 remarks about DHS Secretary Kristi Noem dominated state political coverage at month-end\u2014another potential driver of Google interest.  \n\u2022 None of these pages contain either (a) a Google Trends widget, (b) a screenshot from trends.google.com, or (c) a link to a CSV/JSON export of the daily index, nor do the ancillary results from NBC News, Snopes, or the New York Post. They therefore do not close the core data gap.\n\n2. Status of ingredients required for a volatility calculation  \nAlready available:  \n\u2022 A chronology of at least a dozen discrete news events between 1 Jan and 29 Feb 2026, now enriched with (i) Tillis\u2019 retirement statement (early Jan), (ii) NYT poll publication (16 Jan), (iii) public feud over ICE shooting (late Jan\u2013early Feb), and (iv) run-up to the 3 Mar primary.  \n\u2022 A statistical template (mean, standard deviation, coefficient of variation, largest single-day change, five-day rolling \u03c3, etc.).  \n\nStill missing:  \n\u2022 The day-level Google Trends index values for \u201cThom Tillis\u201d in the United States for 2026-01-01 \u2192 2026-02-29. Without those 60 numbers no quantitative measure\u2014neither standard deviation nor coefficient of variation\u2014can be computed.\n\n3. Why the numeric data remain elusive  \nGoogle Trends shows weekly data by default. Daily granularity only appears when the user selects a window shorter than 90 days inside the web interface or calls an authenticated endpoint. None of the surfaced web pages appear to have gone through that step and then exported the file. No GitHub or Kaggle repository surfaced that contains a pytrends or gtrendsR scrape of the term. The InLibra and GitHub documents retrieved in this round are unrelated to search-interest data.\n\n4. Implications for the requested \u201cvolatility analysis\u201d  \n\u2022 Qualitative insight: The news-event timeline now strongly suggests a choppy profile\u2014clustered media attention in mid-January (NYT poll) and end-January (ICE shooting criticism) followed by campaign-related chatter in February\u2014but this remains an inference.  \n\u2022 Quantitative gap: Because the 0\u2013100 daily index series is still not in hand, any numerical statement about volatility (\u03c3, CV, range, maximum single-day jump) would be speculative and academically unsound.\n\n5. Recommended next retrieval actions  \nThe most efficient path is still to pull the data directly from Google Trends or a third-party API cache.  New targeted queries that have not yet been tried should focus on developer forums and data-science repositories where the CSV may have been shared, or on cached API responses.
