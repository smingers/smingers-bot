## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **CDC HAI decline report (Feb 2)** - Authoritative source, positive hospital news, published 1 day before forecast period starts. This is the most significant recent hospital-specific news. However, it's a technical report that may not drive mass public searches (weak public salience despite strong source quality).

2. **Flu surge data (Jan 13)** - Multiple indicators of elevated hospitalizations in early January. However, this is 3 weeks old and flu seasons typically peak in January, suggesting we may be past peak public concern by early February.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Rural hospital closure trends (Jan 19, Business Insider)** - Recent major publication on ongoing crisis. However, this describes a long-term trend rather than acute breaking news. Published 15 days before forecast period.

2. **Medicaid/OBBBA policy impacts (multiple sources, July-Aug 2025)** - Structural policy changes affecting hospitals, but these are slow-moving institutional changes, not crisis events that drive search spikes.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **International hospital stories (Feb 1-3)** - Multiple stories from Ghana, Portugal, Monaco, Italy, Poland, Singapore, China. These have minimal relevance to US Google Trends for "hospital."

2. **Industry M&A and financial analysis (multiple dates)** - Relevant to hospital sector health but not public-facing news that drives searches.

3. **Gen Z career preferences (Jan 4)** - Interesting long-term trend but not immediate news driver.

**Critical Gap:** The outside view analysis identified several Feb 2 news items (Children's Hospital LA Valentine campaign, CMS funding cuts for gender-affirming care, Minneapolis immigration enforcement fears) that are NOT present in the AskNews articles. This suggests either:
- These stories were less prominent than initially assessed
- They were local/niche stories with limited national reach
- The agent report may have included speculative or less-verified items

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 12 days (Feb 3-15, 2026)

**Current Position:** We are at the START of the forecast window (Feb 3). We need to predict whether the Feb 15 value will be more than 3 points higher, within 3 points, or more than 3 points lower than today's (Feb 3) value.

**Key Temporal Considerations:**

1. **Recent news clustering (Jan 13-Feb 2):** The flu surge (Jan 13), rural hospital closures (Jan 19), and CDC HAI report (Feb 2) represent a 3-week window of hospital-related news. If these already drove searches up through Feb 3, we might expect mean reversion (decrease) over Feb 3-15.

2. **Valentine's Day (Feb 14):** Falls within the forecast window. The Children's Hospital LA card drive mentioned in outside view is not confirmed in AskNews articles, reducing confidence in this as a driver.

3. **News cycle dynamics:** Hospital stories from 2-3 weeks ago (flu surge, rural closures) are likely fading from public attention unless new developments occur. The CDC HAI report (Feb 2) is technical and may not penetrate mass consciousness.

**If timeframe were halved (6 days, Feb 3-9):**
- Higher probability of "Doesn't change" - insufficient time for new news cycles to develop
- Lower probability of "Increases" - recent news (flu, closures) already 2-3 weeks old, likely baked into Feb 3 baseline
- Probability of "Decreases" similar or slightly higher - mean reversion from any Jan spike

**If timeframe were doubled (24 days, Feb 3-27):**
- Higher probability of "Increases" - more time for new hospital-related news events to occur
- Lower probability of "Doesn't change" - harder to maintain stability over longer period
- Probability of "Decreases" similar - depends on whether Feb 3 is elevated or baseline

## (d) Justification

**Reassessing Outside View Base Rates:**

The outside view predicted:
- Increases: 47%
- Doesn't change: 38%
- Decreases: 15%

This was based on:
1. Recent news clustering (Jan 14-Feb 2) creating upward pressure
2. Ongoing stories (policy, charity, access) sustaining attention
3. Tight ±3 threshold making "Doesn't change" harder

**Critical Reassessment with AskNews Evidence:**

1. **News clustering is less robust than initially assessed:**
   - The Feb 2 stories cited in outside view (Valentine campaign, CMS cuts, Minneapolis immigration) are NOT confirmed in AskNews
   - The Belgian cyberattack (Jan 14) and Verizon outage (Jan 14) are 20+ days old and resolved
   - Only confirmed recent hospital-specific news: CDC HAI report (Feb 2) - positive but technical

2. **Flu surge is dated:**
   - Jan 13 data showing peak activity is 21 days before forecast period ends
   - CDC August 2025 outlook predicted January peak - we're now past that
   - Public attention to flu typically peaks with case counts, then declines even if hospitalizations remain elevated

3. **Structural stories (rural closures, OBBBA impacts) are slow-burn:**
   - These create ongoing baseline interest but not acute search spikes
   - The Jan 19 Business Insider article is substantive but 15 days old by forecast end

4. **International stories dominate recent news:**
   - Feb 1-3 AskNews heavily weighted toward non-US hospital stories
   - This suggests a LACK of major US hospital news in the immediate pre-forecast period

**Revised Assessment:**

**Factors Favoring "Decreases":**
1. If Jan 13-19 news (flu surge, rural closures) drove searches up through late January/early February, Feb 3 may represent an elevated baseline
2. Absence of major new US hospital news in Feb 1-3 suggests attention may be waning
3. Flu season peak (January) is past, reducing public concern
4. Mean reversion after any news-driven spike

**Factors Favoring "Doesn't Change":**
1. "Hospital" is a high-volume, stable search term
2. Ongoing structural concerns (rural closures, staffing, policy) maintain baseline interest
3. No evidence of major de-escalation or resolution of concerns
4. CDC HAI report (Feb 2) provides modest positive news but unlikely to drive mass searches

**Factors Favoring "Increases":**
1. Valentine's Day (Feb 14) could drive feel-good hospital stories (though Children's Hospital LA campaign not confirmed)
2. Potential for new hospital-related news to break during 12-day window
3. Ongoing policy debates (Medicaid, rural access) could intensify

**Critical Insight:** The absence of major confirmed US hospital news in the Feb 1-3 period, combined with the 2-3 week age of the flu surge and rural closure stories, suggests that Feb 3 may already reflect a return to baseline or slight decline from any January spike. The tight ±3 threshold means even modest mean reversion could trigger "Decreases."

## Probability Calibration

**Baseline Stability vs. Mean Reversion Tension:**

The key question is: Does Feb 3 represent an elevated baseline (due to Jan news) or a stable baseline?

**Evidence for elevated Feb 3 baseline:**
- Flu surge peaked in January (CDC prediction, Jan 13 data)
- Rural hospital closure story (Jan 19) was major national news
- Multiple hospital-related stories in Jan 13-19 window

**Evidence for stable Feb 3 baseline:**
- Lack of major new US hospital news Feb 1-3
- Flu attention typically fades post-peak even if hospitalizations remain high
- International stories dominating recent news suggests US hospital news cycle has cooled

**Calibration Logic:**

1. If Feb 3 is elevated → Mean reversion favors "Decreases" (35-40%)
2. If Feb 3 is stable → Baseline stability favors "Doesn't change" (45-50%)
3. New news risk over 12 days → "Increases" (20-30%)

Given:
- Stronger evidence for Feb 3 being post-peak (flu cycle, news age) than elevated
- Lack of confirmed ongoing news drivers (Valentine campaign not verified)
- High-volume term stability bias
- But tight ±3 threshold makes stability harder

**Revised Distribution:**

I'm shifting significantly from outside view:
- **"Doesn't change" should be highest** - baseline stability for high-volume term, lack of major new drivers
- **"Decreases" should be second** - mean reversion from any January spike, fading flu attention
- **"Increases" should be lowest** - no confirmed major upcoming drivers, though Valentine's Day and random news risk exist

**Confidence Adjustments:**

Increasing confidence in "Doesn't change" because:
- High-volume term stability is a strong structural factor
- Lack of confirmed new drivers in immediate pre-forecast period
- The ±3 threshold, while tight, is achievable for stable terms

Decreasing confidence in "Increases" because:
- Key drivers from outside view (Valentine campaign, policy stories) not confirmed in AskNews
- Recent news is 2-3 weeks old and likely already reflected in Feb 3 baseline

Moderate confidence in "Decreases" because:
- Mean reversion is plausible but not certain
- Depends heavily on whether Feb 3 is elevated (unclear)

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Predict if Google Trends "hospital" value on Feb 15 will be >3 points higher (Increases), within ±3 (Doesn't change), or >3 lower (Decreases) than Feb 3 value.

2. **Outside view base rate:** Started with Increases 47%, Doesn't change 38%, Decreases 15%. Revising substantially based on evidence showing weaker news drivers and older news cycle than initially assessed.

3. **Consistency check:** Most likely = Doesn't change (baseline stability, no major new drivers); Least likely = Increases (no confirmed upcoming news events); This aligns with evidence of cooling news cycle and stable term characteristics.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - CDC HAI report (Feb 2) - positive hospital news but technical, limited public salience
   - Flu surge data (Jan 13) - 21 days old, past typical peak, attention likely fading
   - Rural hospital closures (Jan 19) - 15 days old by forecast end, slow-burn structural story
   - Absence of major US hospital news Feb 1-3 - suggests cooling news cycle
   - High-volume term stability - structural factor favoring "Doesn't change"

5. **Blind spot:** If a major hospital-related news event breaks during Feb 3-15 (mass casualty, cyberattack, policy shock, disease outbreak), "Increases" could dominate. Random news risk over 12 days is ~10-15%. This is the primary scenario that would make forecast look wrong. Should modestly increase "Increases" probability to account for this tail risk.

6. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.

**Final Calibration:**

- Doesn't change: 50% (baseline stability, no major drivers, but tight threshold creates risk)
- Decreases: 30% (mean reversion from January peak plausible, fading flu attention)
- Increases: 20% (random news risk over 12 days, Valentine's Day possibility, but no confirmed major drivers)

Probabilities: [20, 50, 30]
