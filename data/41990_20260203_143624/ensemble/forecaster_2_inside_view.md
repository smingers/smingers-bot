**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- **CDC HAI decline (Feb 2, 2026):** Third consecutive year of improvement in hospital safety metrics. This is recent, positive news that could generate modest search interest as media covers the report. However, it's a technical report unlikely to drive massive public searches compared to crisis events.
- **Flu surge context (Jan 2026):** 180,000+ hospitalizations by early January, peak expected mid-January per CDC August forecast. By Feb 3, we're likely past peak flu season, suggesting declining hospital-related news coverage through Feb 15.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **BofA hospital financial outlook (Jan 7):** Negative long-term forecast but focused on institutional investors, not general public search behavior.
- **Rural hospital closure risk:** Multiple sources (USA Today, Business Insider, Experian, JD Supra) confirm 700+ hospitals at risk. However, actual closures are gradual and localized, unlikely to spike national searches in a 12-day window unless major closure announced.
- **Weekday composition:** Feb 3, 2026 is Tuesday; Feb 15 is Sunday. Google Trends typically shows 3-6 point drops on Sundays for non-entertainment terms due to lower search activity.

**Weak Evidence:**
- Valentine's Day charity drives (Feb 2 agent report): Minor positive hospital news, very localized impact.
- International hospital news (multiple sources): No direct US relevance.
- Long-term predictions (Experian, Forbes): Focus on 2026 overall, not Feb 3-15 window specifically.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction window:** 12 days (Feb 3-15, 2026)

**Current context:**
- Past peak flu season (January peak per CDC forecast)
- No major hospital crisis emerging in first 3 days of February
- Positive CDC HAI report just released (Feb 2)
- Weekend effect (Sunday Feb 15 vs. Tuesday Feb 3)

**If timeframe halved (6 days to Feb 9):**
Would increase "Doesn't change" probability significantly (~55-60%) because:
- Less time for weekend effect to materialize
- Reduces chance of unexpected news event
- Flu season decline continues smoothly

**If timeframe doubled (24 days to Feb 27):**
Would increase "Decreases" probability (~40-45%) because:
- Captures more post-flu-season decline
- Multiple weekends included (stronger day-of-week effect)
- More time for rural hospital closure news to accumulate

**(d) Justification:**

**Base rate from outside view:**
- Increases: 28%
- Doesn't change: 42%
- Decreases: 30%

**Key adjustments:**

1. **Weekday effect (Strong, -8pp from "Doesn't change" to "Decreases"):** Tuesday to Sunday comparison historically shows 3-6 point drops. This is structural and reliable. The outside view already incorporated this (+15pp to Decreases), but I'm slightly moderating because the specific 2026 context (post-flu-peak, positive CDC news) might dampen the effect.

2. **Post-flu-season decline (Moderate, +5pp to "Decreases"):** CDC forecast predicted January 2026 peak for respiratory hospitalizations. By Feb 3, we're in declining phase. Historical patterns show hospital search interest follows hospitalization trends with ~1-2 week lag. Media coverage of flu surge would be declining through Feb 15, reducing search interest.

3. **Positive CDC HAI report (Weak, +3pp to "Increases"):** Feb 2 release of positive hospital safety data might generate modest media coverage and searches in following days. However, technical reports rarely drive sustained public search interest. This slightly counteracts the decline trend but is insufficient to overcome structural factors.

4. **Absence of major crisis (Moderate, +5pp to "Doesn't change"):** No emerging hospital crisis, cyberattack, or policy shock in early February 2026. This suggests stability, though the weekend effect remains dominant.

5. **Rural hospital closure risk (Weak, +2pp to "Increases"):** While multiple sources document closure risk, actual closures are gradual and localized. Unless a major closure is announced Feb 3-15, this won't spike national searches. The risk is chronic, not acute.

**Net adjustments:**
- Increases: 28% → 30% (+2pp: minor CDC report boost, rural closure background)
- Doesn't change: 42% → 35% (-7pp: weekend effect and post-flu decline outweigh stability)
- Decreases: 30% → 35% (+5pp: post-flu decline + weekend effect dominate)

**Calibration check:**
The 35-35-30 split reflects:
- High uncertainty due to 12-day window and multiple offsetting factors
- Weekend effect and post-flu-season decline as primary drivers toward "Decreases"
- Positive CDC news and stability factors preventing strong "Decreases" conviction
- Low probability of "Increases" absent a major unexpected event

**Blind spots:**
1. **Unexpected hospital crisis:** Cyberattack, mass casualty event, or celebrity hospitalization could spike searches. Historical rate: ~5-10% chance in 12-day window.
2. **Valentine's Day effect:** If hospital charity stories go viral (unlikely but possible), could boost searches. Probability: ~5%.
3. **Policy announcement:** Major CMS or HHS hospital-related policy could drive searches. Given early February timing, less likely.

These blind spots suggest maintaining relatively balanced probabilities rather than strong conviction in any single outcome.

**Probability Calibration:**

Given the evidence:
- **Decreases (35%):** Most likely due to combined weekend effect (Tuesday→Sunday = structural 3-6 point drop) and post-flu-season decline in hospital-related news. However, positive CDC report and absence of crisis prevent higher confidence.
  
- **Doesn't change (35%):** Equally likely because the 3-point threshold creates a buffer. If weekend effect is only 2-3 points and positive CDC news adds 1-2 points, net change could stay within ±3. The high historical base rate (62%) for "no change" supports this.

- **Increases (30%):** Least likely but not negligible. Would require unexpected positive news (major charity drive going viral, celebrity hospital visit) or the CDC HAI report generating more public interest than expected. The 28% outside view base rate plus minor positive news justifies ~30%.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase:** Google Trends value for "hospital" on Feb 15 vs. Feb 3, 2026: >+3 = Increase, ±3 = No change, <-3 = Decrease. 12-day window.

2. **Base rate:** Outside view: Increases 28%, No change 42%, Decreases 30%. Final prediction maintains similar structure with slight shifts.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = Decreases/Doesn't change (tied at 35%); Least likely = Increases (30%). Makes sense given weekend effect + post-flu decline vs. positive CDC news + stability.

4. **Top evidence:**
   - Tuesday→Sunday comparison = structural 3-6 point drop (strong)
   - Post-flu-season decline in hospitalization news (moderate)
   - Positive CDC HAI report Feb 2 (weak upward pressure)
   - Absence of major hospital crisis in early Feb (moderate stability)
   - Historical 62% "no change" base rate creates buffer (strong)

5. **Blind spot:** Unexpected hospital crisis (cyberattack, mass casualty, celebrity event) in Feb 3-15 window could spike searches +10-20 points, making "Increases" outcome. Probability ~5-10%. This justifies not dropping "Increases" below 25%.

6. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [30, 35, 35]
