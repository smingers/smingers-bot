Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Nature Communications Medicine (May 2025):** High-quality peer-reviewed journal article demonstrating that Google Trends data can predict and monitor disease prevalence, specifically for long COVID. This establishes that health-related search behavior follows predictable patterns tied to disease prevalence. The article is factual and methodologically sound, though it doesn't directly address "hospital" search trends or February patterns.

**Frontiers in Big Data (2023):** Academic article providing methodological context for Google Trends research. Key factual information includes Google's 84.08% market share and the 0-100 scaling methodology. High-quality source for understanding how Google Trends works, though dated and not specific to hospital searches.

**Action News 5 (Feb 2024):** Incomplete extraction with no substantive content about February search trends. Cannot be used for analysis.

**CNN (June 24, 2025):** News article describing heightened alert status for hospitals due to potential Iranian cyberattacks following US airstrikes. While this demonstrates how geopolitical events can affect hospital-related attention, it occurred in June 2025, not February, and represents an extraordinary event rather than seasonal patterns. The expert opinions (Meyers, Neuberger, Riggi) are credible but context-specific.

**The Register (Jan 14, 2026):** Recent news about Belgian hospital cyberattack causing operational disruptions. This is a factual report but geographically limited to Belgium and occurred in mid-January, not the February 3-15 window we're analyzing.

**USA Today (Jan 15, 2026):** Article discussing tech outages affecting hospitals, including the January 14 Verizon outage. Contains credible expert opinions from Johns Hopkins and UCSD researchers about hospital vulnerabilities. This is recent (within 3 weeks of our forecast period) and could prime public consciousness about hospital-related issues, though the Verizon outage itself is resolved.

**Agent Report:** Comprehensive methodological overview of how to extract Google Trends data and identifies four February 2026 news items:
- Children's Hospital LA Valentine's Day card drive (positive/charity angle)
- Proposed federal rules threatening Medicare/Medicaid funding for hospitals providing gender-affirming care (major policy story)
- Minneapolis hospital avoidance due to immigration enforcement fears
- Immigration visa suspension lawsuit affecting hospitals

The agent correctly notes that actual historical data hasn't been retrieved, limiting quantitative analysis. The news items are plausibly relevant, particularly the CMS/Medicaid funding rule which could generate sustained national attention.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **February-to-February changes in "hospital" searches (2019-2025):** Most directly relevant but data not provided
2. **Health-related search term stability during non-crisis periods:** Relevant for baseline expectations
3. **News-driven spikes in health facility searches:** Relevant given the policy news
4. **Seasonal patterns in hospital-related searches:** February typically sees winter illness peaks but also post-holiday normalization

**Most suitable reference class:** General stability of health-related search terms during non-pandemic, non-crisis periods, modified by consideration of news-driven events. The COVID-19 period (2020-2021) should be treated as an outlier. Normal years likely show modest fluctuations within the ±3 threshold that defines "no change."

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction timeframe:** 12 days (February 3-15, 2026)

**Current context (as of Feb 3, 2026):**
- We're at the START of the measurement period
- Resolution occurs on Feb 15, giving 12 days for trends to develop
- No major health crisis is currently unfolding (unlike Feb 2020 with COVID-19)
- Winter illness season is ongoing but not exceptional
- Several news stories from Feb 2 could influence searches

**Historical patterns (qualitative expectations from agent report):**
- 2020: Expected large increase (COVID-19 emergence)
- 2021: Possible increase (vaccine rollout, winter wave)
- 2022-2023: Likely return to baseline or decreases
- 2024-2025: Normal seasonal patterns, modest changes
- Most non-pandemic Februarys likely show stability within ±3 points

**(d) Justification:**

The question asks whether Google Trends interest in "hospital" will increase, stay the same (±3 points), or decrease over a 12-day period in early-to-mid February 2026.

**Factors favoring "Doesn't change" (baseline expectation):**
- Google Trends scores typically show relative stability over short periods absent major catalyzing events
- The ±3 point threshold provides a reasonable buffer for normal daily fluctuation
- No active health crisis (pandemic, major outbreak) is underway
- Historical non-pandemic Februarys likely show stability

**Factors favoring "Increases":**
- The proposed CMS/Medicaid funding rule (reported Feb 2) threatening hospitals that provide gender-affirming care is a major national policy story that could drive searches as people seek information
- Children's Hospital LA Valentine's Day campaign may generate positive attention (peaks around Feb 14)
- Recent tech outage and cyberattack stories (Jan 14-15) may have primed public attention to hospital vulnerabilities
- Immigration-related hospital access concerns could drive regional searches
- Winter illness season continues, potentially driving care-seeking behavior

**Factors favoring "Decreases":**
- Post-holiday normalization if January saw elevated searches
- Resolution of immediate concerns from mid-January tech outages
- No compelling reason for sustained decline absent a major "all-clear" signal

**Key uncertainty:** Whether the CMS/Medicaid funding rule story gains traction. If major news outlets amplify this story (affecting hundreds of hospitals and thousands of families), it could drive significant search interest. However, the story may also remain niche to directly affected communities.

Outside view calibration:

**(a) True probability consideration:**
I must avoid both overconfidence and excessive hedging. The ±3 point threshold is meaningful - it represents roughly 3-6% of typical search volume ranges. Small movements are absorbed by "no change," but sustained news attention or behavioral shifts would exceed this threshold.

**(b) Established distributions:**
Without actual historical data, I must estimate based on general principles:
- Most days show small fluctuations (±1-2 points)
- News-driven events can cause 5-15 point swings
- The 12-day window allows time for news to propagate but also for initial spikes to decay
- "No change" should be the plurality outcome in stable periods

**(c) Probability calibration:**
- 90% confidence = 9:1 odds = very strong belief
- 70% confidence = 7:3 odds = moderate belief
- 50% confidence = even odds = maximum uncertainty

**(d) Rate of upsets:**
Google Trends can be volatile around news events. The domain has moderate unpredictability because:
- Unexpected news can break during the 12-day window
- Social media amplification is hard to predict
- The specific news items identified are real but their virality is uncertain

Given one major policy story (CMS/Medicaid rule) with national scope occurring right at the measurement start, plus Valentine's Day hospital charity campaign mid-period, there's meaningful probability of an increase. However, the story may not achieve sufficient penetration, and normal stability would keep us in the "no change" range.

My assessment:
- **Increases:** 45% - The CMS/Medicaid funding rule is a substantial story with broad impact, and Valentine's campaign provides mid-period boost potential. However, uncertain whether it achieves critical mass.
- **Doesn't change:** 47% - Baseline stability expectation with ±3 buffer absorbing normal fluctuations and modest news impact
- **Decreases:** 8% - No strong mechanism for sustained decline; would require active displacement of hospital attention

Outside View Prediction:

Increases: 45%
Doesn't change: 47%
Decreases: 8%
