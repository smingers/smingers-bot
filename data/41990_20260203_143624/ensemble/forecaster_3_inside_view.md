Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
This resolves based on Google Trends (US) for “hospital” comparing 2026-02-03 vs 2026-02-15: **Increases** if Feb 15 is >3 higher, **Decreases** if >3 lower, otherwise **Doesn’t change** (within ±3).

(a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; what’s fact vs opinion)

**TriMedika blog (Jan 13, 2026) – “2026 Flu Surge…”**
- **What it says (facts):** Cites CDC-style metrics (44 jurisdictions high/very high; 25% WoW increase; hospitalization rate >40.6/100k; 180k hospitalizations by early Jan).
- **What it says (opinion/marketing):** Frames H3N2 subclade as “super flu”; promotes a thermometer product as a solution.
- **Quality/date:** Recent-ish but **commercial/marketing** and not primary CDC tables; useful as a “flu pressure is/was high” indicator, but I discount magnitude/phrasing.

**CDC CFA Season Outlook (Aug 25, 2025)**
- **Facts:** CDC expects combined COVID/flu/RSV hospital burden peak similar to prior year; **timing** expectation that national peak hospitalization burden occurs in **January 2026**.
- **Opinions:** Confidence levels and scenario framing are expert-judgment-y but from the relevant authority.
- **Quality/date:** High quality, but dated; still helpful for **season timing** (peak likely already passed by early Feb).

**Chief Healthcare Executive (hospital M&A, 2026 expectations)**
- **Facts:** 2025 had 46 announced mergers; survey percentages.
- **Opinions (named experts):** Mixed views on whether M&A increases in 2026.
- **Quality/date:** Industry trade outlet; relevant to “hospital” as a sector but unlikely to move broad public search for the generic term “hospital” over a 12-day window.

**USA Today (Aug 24, 2025) rural hospitals & Medicaid cuts**
- **Facts:** Claims about 700 at risk; KFF estimates; examples of closures.
- **Opinions:** Political quotes and advocates’ framing.
- **Quality/date:** Mainstream outlet but **months old** for our window; likely background, not a 2/3–2/15 driver.

**Holland & Knight (Jul 2025) skilled nursing / OBBB impacts**
- **Facts:** Policy description; studies of at-risk facilities; Medicare SNF rules.
- **Opinions:** Legal-industry interpretive emphasis.
- **Quality/date:** Credible, but not timely for a mid-Feb 2026, 12-day Google Trends move.

**Business Insider (Jan 19, 2026) rural hospital closures maps**
- **Facts:** Long-run closures since 2005, at-risk counts, conversions to rural emergency centers.
- **Quality/date:** Recent and potentially attention-getting, but it’s still more “policy/industry news” than something that reliably shifts nationwide generic searches for “hospital” day-to-day.

**Asknews (Feb 1–3, 2026 set)**
- Most items are **non-US** (Portugal, Poland, Italy, Monaco, Singapore, Ghana), or niche (medical tourism summit).
- **CIDRAP (Feb 2, 2026) HAIs declined in 2024:** credible, factual public health reporting. But it’s about infection metrics and 2024—unlikely to cause a large Feb 3→Feb 15 shift in searches for the generic term.
- **Net:** little direct US “hospital” headline pressure in the immediate window from these articles.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted factors affecting the Feb 15 vs Feb 3 difference)

**Strong evidence**
1) **Seasonality timing from CDC (peak in January 2026)**  
   - Mechanism: if “hospital” searches partly track acute respiratory disease burden/utilization, early Feb → mid Feb is more likely flat-to-down than sharply up.  
   - Direction: mild pull toward **Decreases** (or “no change” rather than “increase”).

2) **Day-of-week comparison risk (Feb 3 = Tuesday; Feb 15 = Sunday)**  
   - Not directly in sources, but it’s a structural property of many Google Trends series (weekly cycles).  
   - Mechanism: routine scheduling/administrative searches can be lower on weekends; if amplitude exceeds ~3 points, that can trigger **Decreases**.  
   - Because the resolution is a single-day-to-single-day comparison, this matters more than usual.

**Moderate evidence**
3) **Recent rural hospital closure / healthcare system strain coverage (Business Insider Jan 19; plus older policy pieces)**  
   - Mechanism: policy/closure stories can create periodic search interest, but often for specific hospital names or “rural hospital,” not the generic “hospital.”  
   - Direction: slight pull toward **Increases**, but likely modest.

4) **Flu surge narrative (TriMedika, early Jan)**  
   - Mechanism: continued flu pressure could maintain elevated hospital attention.  
   - Direction: small pull toward **Increases** or preventing a decrease; tempered by marketing bias + January timing.

**Weak evidence**
5) **Hospital M&A / medical tourism summit / international hospital system stories**  
   - Mechanism: low relevance to US public searching “hospital” in a narrow 12-day window.  
   - Direction: essentially neutral.

Net evidence takeaway: compared to my outside-view base rates, the inside-view evidence tilts away from “Increases” and toward “Doesn’t change” or “Decreases,” mainly due to (i) likely post-peak respiratory season trajectory and (ii) single-day weekday→Sunday comparison risk.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time left:** 12 days (from 2026-02-03 to 2026-02-15).
- If **halved** (~6 days), I’d further favor **Doesn’t change**, because there’s less time for a new storyline to build; day-of-week effects could still matter depending on endpoints.
- If **doubled** (~24 days), I’d increase probability of a clearer **Decreases** (typical late-winter easing) *and* increase tail risk of **Increases** due to random shocks/news (mass casualty event, major scandal/outage) having more time to occur.

(d) Justification (updating the outside view)
Outside-view base rate distribution (given):  
- Increases 45 / Doesn’t change 47 / Decreases 8

Key updates:
1) **CDC timing (Jan peak) makes a sustained “increase” less base-rate-consistent** for early-to-mid February; more consistent with flat-to-down.
2) **Endpoint weekday→Sunday** introduces a non-trivial risk of a >3-point drop even without any “real-world” change—this specifically increases the **Decreases** bucket versus my earlier base rates.
3) There is **no strong, immediate, US-wide breaking story in the provided current news set** that screams “national spike in searches for the generic term ‘hospital’” over the next 12 days.

So I shift probability mass mainly from **Increases** into **Decreases**, while keeping **Doesn’t change** as the plurality because the ±3 band is fairly forgiving and “hospital” is a high-baseline, always-relevant term.

Probability calibration
- I’m aiming for a realistic distribution, not a hedge: my modal outcome is still “Doesn’t change,” but I’m materially less bullish on “Increases” than the outside-view because the most salient near-term drivers point to flat-to-down and the endpoint-day effect could be decisive.
- A ±10% shift would be meaningful here: if you told me “a major US hospital scandal/cyber event breaks Feb 10,” I’d move ~10–15 points from “Doesn’t change/Decreases” into “Increases.”
- Blind spot: **an unforeseen, high-salience US event** (mass shooting, celebrity hospitalization/death, major hospital cyberattack/outage, natural disaster) can create a step-change in searches that overwhelms seasonality and weekday/weekend patterns. That scenario would make my reduced “Increases” probability look too low.

Checklist:
1. Criteria: Compare Trends value on 2026-02-15 vs 2026-02-03; >3 up = Increases, within ±3 = Doesn’t change, >3 down = Decreases.
2. Outside view base rates: [45, 47, 8].
3. Consistency: Most likely = Doesn’t change; least likely = Decreases (but less least-likely than before); aligned with endpoint/seasonality rationale.
4. Most significant evidence (<=20 words each):
   - CDC expects respiratory hospitalization peak in January 2026 (post-peak by Feb).
   - Feb 3 Tuesday vs Feb 15 Sunday could induce weekend dip >3.
   - No strong immediate US-wide “hospital” headline pressure in provided Feb 1–3 articles.
   - Rural-hospital stress coverage exists but tends to be niche/non-generic search behavior.
5. Blind spot: sudden national crisis tied to hospitals (cyberattack, mass casualty, celebrity event) causing a spike.
6. Technicalities: probabilities 0–100, sum to 100, ordered correctly.

Probabilities: [32, 46, 22]
