Analysis
(a) Source analysis (condensed to the handful most pertinent to US-based Google searches over the next 12 days)

1. CDC CFA “2025-26 Respiratory Season Outlook”, 25 Aug 2025  
   • Facts: Combined flu/COVID/RSV hospitalisations forecast to peak in Jan 2026.  
   • Quality: High, official epidemiological modelling.  
   • Insight: Hospital stress is already elevated and public-facing coverage is high now; peak likely passing.

2. TriMedika blog on H3N2 “super-flu”, 13 Jan 2026  
   • Facts: 25 % WoW flu-case rise; 180 000 hospitalisations by early Jan.  
   • Quality: Trade-press marketing piece, but cites CDC numbers (moderate).  
   • Insight: Reinforces that hospital-strain stories have been in the news since early Jan — today’s Google interest may already be near a local high.

3. CIDRAP report on 2024 HAI decline, 2 Feb 2026  
   • Facts: Data release; coverage limited to infection-control community.  
   • Quality: High for facts, but niche audience.  
   • Insight: Unlikely to move mass-search behaviour.

4. Business Insider map of rural hospital closures, 19 Jan 2026  
   • Facts: 110 closures since 2005, 800 at risk; policy context.  
   • Quality: Main-stream journalism (moderate).  
   • Insight: Contributes to steady background coverage rather than a sudden spike.

5. AskNews sweep (3 Feb 2026): mix of international hospital stories, medical-tourism summit, staffing shortfalls in Ghana, Polish protest in March, etc.  
   • All non-US or scheduled outside the 12-day window.  
   • Quality: Varies; relevance to US Google searches is weak.

(b) Evidence weighing

Strong­–  
• Weekly seasonality in Google Trends: weekday values for generic service terms routinely 5-10 RSV points above weekend values ⇒ structural, repeatable.

Moderate­–  
• Hospital-related media coverage has been elevated since Dec-Jan due to flu surge, implying today’s (Tue) RSV may already be near the local maximum.  
• CDC explicitly projects the hospitalisation peak in Jan, suggesting headlines may cool rather than intensify over the next two weeks.

Weak­–  
• Possibility of an unforeseen national event (mass casualty, large cyber-attack) that suddenly spikes searches. Historical frequency within any random 12-day slice ≈ single-digit %.  
• Ongoing policy debates (OBBBA Medicaid cuts) – slow-burn, unlikely to swing daily public search interest.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon: 12 days (3 Feb–15 Feb 2026).  
If the window were doubled (24 days), probability mass would shift a little from “Decrease” to “Increase” because the chance of a random spike grows with time. Halved (6 days) would further favour “Decrease” since seasonality dominates and chance of surprise news falls.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base-rate (outside view) was Incr 19 / No-chg 35 / Decr 46.  
Inside view pushes:

+6 pts to Decrease: Tuesday-to-Sunday comparison and historically lower weekend RSV.  
–5 pts to No-change: ±3 band is tight; weekday/weekend gap alone often exceeds it.  
–1 pt to Increase: Flu news probably past its peak; only low-probability shocks would create >3-point uptick.

Adjusted distribution rounded to whole numbers.

Probability calibration
Most likely driver of a forecaster error: an unforeseen nationally salient hospital incident (e.g., major ransomware attack) on or just before 15 Feb spiking search interest upward; this risk keeps “Increase” at a non-trivial 15 %.

Checklist (abridged)
1. Option paraphrase: Compare US Google-Trends daily RSV for “hospital” on 3 Feb vs 15 Feb; >+3 = Increase, within ±3 = No change, <–3 = Decrease.  
2. Outside view stated above.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = Decrease, least likely = Increase – aligns with rationale.  
4. Key evidence: a) weekday-weekend seasonality; b) Tue vs Sun endpoint; c) Jan flu peak may be past; d) surprise-event probability low.  
5. Blind-spot: major US hospital cyberattack or mass casualty event before 15 Feb.  
6. Probabilities sum to 100 and are 0-100 integers.

Probabilities: [15, 25, 60]
