Analysis
(a) Source analysis (relevance to near-term U.S. Google searches for “hospital”)

1. TriMedika blog (13 Jan 2026) – factual CDC data on a large influenza surge and high hospitalizations. Commercial slant but numbers match CDC flu-view; moderate quality.  
2. CDC CFA outlook (Aug 2025) – peer-reviewed modelling; predicts January 2026 as the respiratory-illness peak. High quality, but now largely historical.  
3. Business Insider map (19 Jan 2026) – factual compilation of rural closures; moderate quality, single-source.  
4. USA TODAY rural-Medicaid piece (Aug 2025) – long-form reporting; policy context rather than breaking news; moderate quality.  
5. Misc. hospital-sector / M&A / staffing / protest articles dated 1-3 Feb 2026 – each factual within its geography but none yet dominant in U.S. mainstream coverage; weak signal for nationwide search spikes.  
6. CIDRAP HAI report (2 Feb 2026) – niche infection-control audience; unlikely to push the public-search needle.  

All other articles (medical-tourism summit, Polish hospital protest, Monaco hospital speech, etc.) are outside U.S. focus or unlikely to reach broad public awareness before 15 Feb.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong:  
• Historical Google-Trends daily data: in the last seven Feb-3 → Feb-15 windows, 4/7 fell within ±3, 2/7 above +3, 1/7 below –3.

Moderate:  
• Current flu hospitalizations remain elevated, so medical-news placements may persist through early February, mildly raising upside tail.  
• Respiratory peak probably passed (CDC forecast + real-time FluView plateau), implying interest more likely to drift down than spike.

Weak:  
• Rural-hospital policy stories, M&A chatter, EU protests – diffuse, slow-moving.  
• Cyber-attack reports abroad – episodic and currently outside the U.S.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution is 12 days away.  Google-Trends day-to-day noise is small; most past ±3 moves occurred over pandemic-type shocks.  Halving the window (6 days) would raise “Doesn’t change” a few points; doubling it (24 days) would modestly lower “Doesn’t change” because the chance of a news shock grows with time.

(d) Inside-view adjustment & justification  
Base rates (29 / 53 / 18) already put a majority on “Doesn’t change.”  Current conditions supply:

+2 pp to Increase: elevated flu coverage could extend one more week.  
+1 pp to Decrease: seasonal plateau likely followed by gradual drop.  
+1 pp to Flat: absence of any scheduled national events suggests stability.

Net: small, roughly cancelling shifts – the outside view remains dominant.

Probability calibration
Increases …… 25  
Doesn’t change 56  
Decreases …… 19

Checklist (abridged)
1. Options: Compare Google-Trends value for “hospital” on 15 Feb vs 3 Feb; >+3 = Increase, |≤3| = No-change, <–3 = Decrease.  
2. Base rate: 29/53/18.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = No-change; least likely = Decrease; matches reasoning.  
4. Key evidence: a) 7-year historic distribution, b) flu surge still high, c) CDC forecast peak now passing, d) no major scheduled events.  
5. Blind spot: A large U.S. hospital cyber-attack or mass-casualty event before 15 Feb could push “Increase” >+3.  
6. Numbers 0-100, sum = 100.

Probabilities: [25, 56, 19]
