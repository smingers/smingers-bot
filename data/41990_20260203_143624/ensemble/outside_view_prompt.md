# Summary of "Utilizing Google Trends data to enhance forecasts and monitor long COVID prevalence"

**Source:** Nature (Communications Medicine)  
**Date:** May 16, 2025

## Key Facts and Findings:

**Study Focus:**
- Researchers investigated using Google Trends data to enhance surveillance and monitoring of long COVID prevalence
- The study selected 33 search terms and 20 related topics from long COVID symptoms lists provided by the CDC and the database "scite"
- Researchers developed a statistical method to calculate merged search volumes from Google Trends data

**Main Finding:**
- Searches for several specific long COVID symptoms increased both before and after searches for "long COVID" itself
- This demonstrates that numbers of searches can predict long COVID prevalence
- Google search results could be used to monitor disease prevalence

**Background Statistics on Long COVID:**
- As of July 7, 2024: over 776 million confirmed COVID-19 cases globally with 7 million deaths
- WHO estimates: 10-20% of individuals who recovered from acute COVID-19 develop long COVID
- UK Office for National Statistics: reports 3% prevalence for long COVID in the UK
- Italian study: 87% of hospitalized COVID-19 patients exhibited at least one persistent symptom 60 days after recovery
- Meta-analysis (194 studies, 735,006 participants): estimated 45% of COVID-19 survivors experienced at least one unresolved symptom
- Alternative estimate: ~20% rate of long COVID (per Yao et al. review)

**Study Rationale:**
- Traditional surveillance relies on medical records with self-reported symptoms, but this only captures individuals who sought medical attention
- Many patients with mild symptoms may not seek medical care and adopt self-management approaches
- No specific biomarkers or diagnostic tests can reliably confirm long COVID diagnosis
- Lack of consistent definition of long COVID complicates surveillance

**Relevance to Hospital Search Trends:**
The article discusses how Google Trends data can be used for disease surveillance and forecasting, providing methodological context for understanding search behavior patterns related to health conditions.

# Summary of Article: "Google Trends for health research: Its advantages, application, methodological considerations, and limitations in psychiatric and mental health infodemiology"

## Key Facts and Information:

**About Google Trends:**
- Google Trends is an open online tool that provides real-time and archived information about Google queries from 2004 onward
- Data can be retrieved for the last 7 days (real-time) and archival data from January 2004 up to 36 hours before the search is conducted
- Google Trends anonymizes users' data, categorizes search queries into topics, and aggregates them
- Data points are scaled from 0 to 100 "based on a topic's proportion to all searches on all topics"
- Each data point is divided by the total searches of the geography and time range it represents to compare relative popularity

**Google's Market Share:**
- According to Statista (2023), Google had approximately 84.08% of the global search engine market share as of December 2022
- This is significantly higher than competitors: Bing (8.95%), Baidu (0.67%), and Yahoo! (2.60%)

**Advantages:**
- Data represents actual behavior rather than users' stated preferences
- Provides real-time data for monitoring behavior
- Automatically anonymizes user information
- Freely available (unlike paid alternatives like Baidu Index)
- Can provide readily available data about sensitive health topics like mental disorders, suicide, and illegal drugs
- Represents a large proportion of the population due to Google's market dominance

**Application in Research:**
- From January 2004 to January 2014, Nuti et al. (2014) noted 70 studies that utilized Google Trends
- More than a quarter (27%) were used to explore [article appears to be cut off]
- Has been used for predictions, nowcasting, and forecasting health-related topics

**Methodological Considerations:**
Studies using Google Trends should document:
- Exact keywords
- Query category
- Time range
- Location
- Date of retrieval

**Limitations:**
- Restricted representation (only people who use Google search engine)
- Limited validity in areas with low internet penetration or freedom of speech
- Does not provide absolute search volumes
- Unknown sampled queries
- Limited transparency in its algorithm, especially regarding terms and idioms subsumed under "topic" keywords
- Limited applicability in countries where Google has limited services (e.g., China)

**Note:** The article extraction appears incomplete as it cuts off mid-sentence at the end.

**Disclaimer**: The extracted content appears to be incomplete or poorly formatted. The article title suggests it should contain information about "February's top Google search trends," but the actual body content is missing. What was extracted appears to be primarily website navigation elements, headers, and a list of other unrelated news stories from the Action News 5 website.

**Summary**:

The article is titled "Inside February's top Google search trends" and was published on February 28, 2024 by actionnews5.com. However, the substantive content of the article that would discuss the actual Google search trends for February is not present in the extracted text. 

The extraction only captured:
- Website navigation and menu items
- Publication/update timestamps (Feb. 28, 2024 at 2:38 PM CST, updated at 4:59 PM CST)
- Headlines from other unrelated local news stories (about weather, crime, health, politics, and education in the Memphis area)

**Relevance to forecasting question**: This article cannot provide useful information for forecasting Google Trends interest in "hospital" between February 3-15, 2026, as the actual content about search trends is not available in the extraction, and the article is from 2024, not 2026.

# Summary of Article: "Iran, a potent cyberthreat, may respond with infiltration and hacking America's critical infrastructure"

**Source:** CNN  
**Date:** June 24, 2025  
**Author:** Sean Lyngaas

## Key Facts and Events:

- **US airstrikes on Iran:** The United States dropped massive bombs on three nuclear sites inside Iran on Saturday (June 21, 2025)
- **Iranian retaliation:** Iran fired missiles towards a US military base in Qatar in retaliation for the US strikes
- **Ceasefire announced:** President Donald Trump announced a ceasefire between Israel and Iran hours after the Iranian missile strikes, though it remained unclear if it would hold

## Critical Infrastructure on Alert:

- Hospitals, water dams, and power plants across the US are on alert for potential Iranian cyberattacks
- The US power grid's cyberthreat-sharing center has been monitoring the dark web for Iranian activity in the three days following US strikes
- Hospital executives have been checking in with the FBI on threat levels

## Expert Assessments:

- **Adam Meyers (Senior VP at CrowdStriker):** "Iran's kinetic retaliation is already in motion and the digital dimension to that may not be far behind." He noted no new confirmed breaches from Iranian hackers as of Monday, but hackers linked with Iran have been scanning the internet for vulnerable software and talking openly about retaliating against US organizations

- **Anne Neuberger (former deputy national security adviser under Biden):** "Iranian cyberattacks have been plays for attention as well as impact"

- **John Riggi (American Hospital Association national advisor for cybersecurity):** The association "is in close coordination with the FBI regarding any physical or cyber threats to hospitals and the broader healthcare sector"

## Historical Iranian Cyber Activity:

- After the Israel-Gaza war began in fall 2023, there were multiple cyberattacks on US water facilities blamed on Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps
- Pro-Iran hackers breached internet-connected industrial equipment at a water plant outside Pittsburgh, forcing manual operation
- FBI blamed Tehran for a cyberattack on Boston Children's Hospital in 2021
- Iran created a website in 2020 that threatened US election officials

## Official Statements:

- **DHS bulletin (Sunday):** Tehran could "target" American government officials if Iranian leaders believe "the stability or survivability" of their regime is at risk

- **DHS public advisory (Sunday):** "Low-level cyber attacks against US networks by pro-Iranian hacktivists are likely, and cyber actors affiliated with the Iranian government may conduct attacks against US networks"

- **CISA spokesperson Marci McCarthy (Monday night):** "There are currently no specific credible threats against the homeland"

- **Office of the Director of National Intelligence (March threat assessment):** "Iran's growing expertise and willingness to conduct aggressive cyber operations make it a major threat to the security of U.S. networks and data"

## Additional Context:

- Iran's cyber capabilities are not as advanced as China or Russia, but can be more unpredictable
- For Iran, retaliation against the US is "far easier in cyberspace than physically"
- Iranian hackers often exaggerate their success to gain psychological advantage

**Relevance to forecast question:** This article describes heightened alert status for hospitals due to potential Iranian cyberattacks, which could potentially affect search interest in "hospital" if actual attacks occur or if public concern increases.

# Article Summary: Verizon Outage Warns of Future Tech Disruption Dangers

## Key Facts and Statistics:
- **January 14 Verizon outage**: Impacted more than 1.5 million customers' ability to make calls and use cell phones
- **Duration**: Nearly 10 hours of disruption, leaving users without access to calling, texting, or network internet services
- **Cause**: Tied to a software issue according to Verizon; company stated no indication of cyberattack
- **Company response**: Verizon apologized and said it would offer credits to affected customers

## Other Recent Major Outages Mentioned:
- November 18, 2025: Cloudflare failure
- 2024: CrowdStrike outage causing "blue screen of death" on Windows systems (affected airports, grocery stores, hospitals, 911 call centers; flights grounded, surgeries postponed)
- 2025: Australian telecommunications company Optus outage during network upgrade left hundreds unable to contact emergency services; at least two deaths blamed on the outage (per Reuters)

## Impacts on Hospitals and Healthcare:
- Tech outages can cause delays in patient care, leading to worse health outcomes
- Hospitals rely on network connections for: electronic health records, radiology systems, employee scheduling systems
- Doctors/nurses depend on electronic health records to check patient allergies to medications
- Average hospital has "dozens if not hundreds of different applications and systems" required for normal operations
- Research shows patients in areas where hospitals were hit by cyberattacks and lost tech functions "end up doing worse"

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):
- **Javad Abed** (cybersecurity expert and assistant professor, Johns Hopkins University): "We need to treat outages as a routine risk, not a rare event. Even the most reliable infrastructure can fail unexpectedly, and recovery is almost never instant."
- **Jeffrey Tully** (anesthesiology professor, University of California San Diego, healthcare cybersecurity researcher): Noted tech outages cause delays in patient care and worse health outcomes
- **James Kendra** (co-director, Disaster Research Center, University of Delaware): Recommends having cash and paper copies of important documents
- **Alyssa Provencio** (professor, University of Central Oklahoma, disaster management certificate program): Suggested having a radio for emergency updates

## Preparation Recommendations:
- Keep cash on hand
- Maintain paper copies of important documents (bank statements, insurance, phone bills, mortgage/rent documents)
- Consider having a landline or use Wi-Fi calling/SMS during outages
- Keep a radio for emergency updates
- Know your medications and medical conditions if in a hospital during an outage
- Companies should not rely on single service providers for critical functions

Query: Retrieve daily US Google Trends scores for the search term “hospital” from 2019-01-01 through 2026-02-02 and compute, for each year, the change from Feb 3 to Feb 15; then summarize the distribution of those changes and highlight any 2026-specific news likely to move interest.
The objective is to deliver (a) daily U-S Google Trends scores for the search term “hospital” from 2019-01-01 through 2026-02-02, (b) for every calendar year, the point-to-point change in search interest between 3 February and 15 February, (c) a summary of the distribution of those yearly changes, and (d) any February-2026 news that is likely to move public interest around the word “hospital”.

1. What the current search results provide  
•  Methods for extracting Google Trends at daily granularity – Google normally returns weekly points for multi-year requests, but daily points can be retrieved by slicing the period into ≤90-day windows and stitching them back together.  This technique is documented in the archived GitHub “pytrends” issue thread (#174) and in several tutorials (Lazarina Stoy, 2021; JMIR methodology framework, 2019).  
•  Confirmation that pytrends (or the web interface plus manual export) remains the only practical way to obtain day-by-day values; no public web page lists historic daily RSV (relative search volume) for a single term across multiple years.  
•  No numerical Google Trends data for “hospital” itself – the search results contain only methodological literature, not the dataset we must analyse.  
•  News items dated 2 February 2026 that may plausibly influence U-S search interest in “hospital”:  
  – Children’s Hospital Los Angeles launching its Valentine’s Day card drive (Times Argus, 2 Feb 2026).  
  – Proposed federal rules that could strip Medicare/Medicaid funds from hospitals providing gender-affirming care to minors, threatening closure of Cincinnati Children’s Transgender Health Center and similar clinics (The Enquirer, 2 Feb 2026).  
  – A Minneapolis public-health crisis in which residents avoid hospitals because of fear of federal immigration agents (The Guardian, 2 Feb 2026).  
  – A lawsuit over a presidential order suspending immigrant-visa processing for 75 countries, which hospitals warn could reduce patient volumes and financing (Al Jazeera, 2 Feb 2026).  
  – Miscellaneous hospital-related headlines concerning high-profile personalities (New York Post, 2 Feb 2026).  

2. Steps still required to fulfil the quantitative portion of the query  
a. Data extraction  
   i.  Use pytrends’ TrendReq() with `keyword='hospital'`, `geo='US'`, and slice the range 2019-01-01 to 2026-02-02 into sequential 90-day windows, overlapping by one day to allow later rescaling (as suggested in GitHub issue #174).  
   ii. Concatenate the resulting data frames and apply the usual min-max rescaling procedure so that the entire series remains on the native 0-to-100 Google scale (because each 90-day request is scaled independently).  

b. Calculation of yearly Feb-3 → Feb-15 deltas  
   – For each calendar year 2019-2026, identify the values on 3 February and 15 February (note that 2026 only contributes up to 2 Feb 2026 in the raw pull, so an extra window 2026-02-02 → 2026-04-15 will have to be queried to capture 15 Feb 2026).  
   – Compute ΔRSV = RSV(15 Feb) − RSV(3 Feb).  
   – Compile the eight yearly deltas (2019-2026).  

c. Summary statistics  
   – Compute mean, median, standard deviation, inter-quartile range and min/max of the eight deltas.  
   – Plot a simple bar chart or a box-and-whisker plot; visually check for outliers (2020 is likely to be extreme because COVID-19 first attracted wide attention in early February 2020).  

3. Anticipated shape of the distribution (qualitative expectation)  
   •  2020 is expected to show a sharp rise: WHO declared a Public-Health Emergency of International Concern on 30 Jan 2020; by early February U-S media began heavy coverage of hospitals preparing for COVID-19.  
   •  2021 may show a smaller but still positive change, corresponding to the winter wave and vaccine-roll-out stories.  
   •  2022 and 2023 likely revert toward baseline or even negative territory as COVID salience faded in February of those years.  
   •  2024 and 2025 may track normal seasonal flu/hospitalisation coverage, likely modest changes.  
   •  2026 is uncertain and will depend on the news items listed above; the Children’s Hospital LA Valentine campaign and regulatory threats to paediatric clinics could boost attention, while immigration-related hospital fears might push “hospital” searches regionally but not necessarily nationally.  

4. February-2026 news most likely to move the “hospital” search curve  
   a. Hospital policy/regulatory shocks  
      – The proposed CMS/Medicaid rule to cut off funding for hospitals that provide gender-affirming care to minors (The Enquirer, 2 Feb 2026) has nationwide scope and has already triggered closures in other states; its announcement may prompt a spike in searches such as “hospital funding”, “hospital transgender clinic”, or simply the base term “hospital”.  
   b. Public-interest charity event  
      – Children’s Hospital Los Angeles’ nationally promoted Valentine’s Day card drive (Times Argus, 2 Feb 2026) historically produces social-media amplification and could lift general searches for “hospital”, particularly between 2 Feb and 14 Feb.  
   c. Access‐to-care controversy  
      – The Minneapolis public-health crisis tied to ICE activity and fear of visiting healthcare facilities (The Guardian, 2 Feb 2026) may localise a spike in “hospital” queries when the story is syndicated.  
   d. Immigration visa suspension lawsuit  
      – If major outlets frame the lawsuit (Al Jazeera, 2 Feb 2026) as an issue affecting U-S hospital burden and uncompensated care, a national-level uptick is conceivable.  
   e. High-profile celebrity hospital anecdote  
      – The Peter Attia/Jeffrey Epstein revelation (New York Post, 2 Feb 2026) is scandal-driven and might cause a transient search bump.  

5. Information gaps  
•  The actual Google Trends daily values remain to be downloaded.  Without them the year-over-year February deltas and their distribution cannot be computed or summarised numerically.  
•  A single slicing routine must be run for 2019-2026; the search results do not provide an off-the-shelf CSV.  
•  Once the data are obtained, it will be important to document the rescaling procedure so that the 0-100 range is consistent across slices; otherwise the Feb-3 and Feb-15 points drawn from different windows would be incomparable (JMIR, 2019; pytrends FAQ).  
•  The current news scan only covers items published up to 2 Feb 2026.  Monitoring through 15 Feb 2026 (e.g., follow-ups on funding rules, results of the Valentine’s campaign, any sudden disease outbreaks or mass-casualty events) will be needed to judge whether additional drivers emerge.  

6. Recommended next actions  
•  Run the pytrends data pull and calculations as outlined in section 2.  
•  Keep a live news watchlist for “hospital” between 3 Feb and 15 Feb 2026 via Google News alerts so any late-breaking events (e.g., severe winter storms causing hospital crowding) are captured.  
•  After the dataset is assembled, return to this framework to insert the numeric delta table and statistical synopsis, then finalise the distribution narrative.  

In summary, the methodological pathway to meet the original request is clear and well documented in the supplied sources, but the crucial Google Trends daily dataset has not yet been retrieved.  Quantitative results and a definitive distribution analysis therefore remain outstanding.  The February-2026 news scan has identified four policy or human-interest story lines with national reach that are the most plausible candidates to shift Google search behaviour around “hospital” during the 3 Feb–15 Feb window.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
