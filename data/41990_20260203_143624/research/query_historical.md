Analysis:
The Google Trends value for “hospital” on 2026-02-03 (53) is mid-range, not at a recent peak or trough.  Over the last month the daily series has moved between the low 40s and the high 60s, so a ±3 band is narrow relative to typical day-to-day noise.  Historical seasonality is the first thing to examine: searches for “hospital” often climb during flu/COVID surges (typically December–January) and then drift down through February, but year-to-year the shape and magnitude vary.  Second, large news events (e.g., high-profile hospital cyberattacks, labor strikes, shootings, or major policy stories) can cause single-day spikes that raise the 7-day average for several days.  To build an outside view I need:
1) Multi-year daily Google Trends history to measure the typical change from Feb 3 to Feb 15 and the probability of moves larger than 3 points.
2) Recent news coverage that could plausibly drive interest up or down in the next two weeks (e.g., looming strikes, epidemics, hospital closures).
