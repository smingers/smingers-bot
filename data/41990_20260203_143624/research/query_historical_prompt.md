You are currently doing research for historical information on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “hospital” change between 2026-02-03 and 2026-02-15 according to Google Trends?

The options are:
['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “hospital” at the time of writing this question (Feb 1, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 53; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=hospital&date=2026-01-02%202026-02-01).

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves “Doesn't change” if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=hospital&date=2026-01-16%202026-02-15](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=hospital&date=2026-01-16%202026-02-15) for 2026-02-15 is within 3 of the value at 2026-02-03. It resolves “Increases” if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves “Decreases” if the value is more than 3 lower.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model equipped with capable web crawlers and designed to generate lengthy, detailed responses. As such, you may use a longer query with detailed instructions. It is possible to ask multiple questions.
