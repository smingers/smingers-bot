(d) Justification:
Key factors influencing search interest:
- Severe flu season
- Emerging healthcare policy discussions
- AI in healthcare technologies
- Winter health concerns
- Potential hospital ownership changes

Outside view calibration:
- Historical data suggests high variability in search trends
- 90% of 12-day windows show significant changes
- Recent trend shows slight upward movement
- Multiple contextual factors could drive search interest

Considering the complexity of factors and historical variability, a balanced probability distribution is appropriate.

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 42%
Doesn't change: 28%
Decreases: 30%

Rationale: The slight upward trend, combined with multiple potential search interest drivers (flu season, policy changes, medical technology), suggests a moderate likelihood of increased search interest, but with significant uncertainty warranting a relatively balanced probability distribution.
