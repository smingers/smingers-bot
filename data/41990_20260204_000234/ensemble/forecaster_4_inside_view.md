4. Technology integration in healthcare

Blind Spot Statement:
Unexpected global health event could dramatically shift search interest

2. Base rate distribution maintained
3. Consistency aligned with evidence
4. Key evidence validated

6. Probabilities will sum to 100

Probability Calibration:
Considering the evidence, demographic trends, and current context, I'll adjust the probabilities:
