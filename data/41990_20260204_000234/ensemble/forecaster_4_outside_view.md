(b) Reference Class Analysis:
Potential reference classes:

2. Seasonal healthcare search patterns
3. Short-term (12-day) search trend volatility

Most Suitable Reference Class: Short-term search trend volatility
- Google Trends data shows 90% of 12-day windows have >3 point changes
- Indicates high likelihood of meaningful search interest fluctuation

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction period: 12 days (2026-02-03 to 2026-02-15)
- Current Google Trends value: 90
- 90-day mean: 78.8
- Recent trend: Slightly increasing (79.1 vs 77.3 in prior week)

(d) Justification:
Key factors influencing prediction:
- Seasonal health trends (winter flu season)
- Ongoing healthcare policy discussions
- Potential medical technology developments
- Typical search trend volatility

Outside view calibration:
- 90% of historical 12-day windows show >3 point changes
- Recent trend shows slight upward momentum
- Multiple contextual factors could drive search interest
- No strong singular driver suggests dramatic change

Consideration of unexpected outcomes:
- Healthcare policy shifts could trigger sudden interest
- Potential medical events not captured in current data
- Moderate uncertainty in search behavior prediction

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 45%
Doesn't change: 15%
Decreases: 40%

Rationale: The high historical variability in search trends, combined with contextual healthcare developments, suggests a roughly balanced probability between increases and decreases, with a slight bias towards increase due to recent upward trend.
