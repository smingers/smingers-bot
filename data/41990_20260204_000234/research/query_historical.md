Analysis:
This forecasting question requires understanding potential fluctuations in Google search interest for the term "hospital" between February 3-15, 2026. The baseline context is a current interest value of 53, with the resolution dependent on whether the value changes by more than ±3 points during the specified period. To assess this, I'll look for potential factors that might influence healthcare-related search interest, such as ongoing health events, policy changes, or seasonal trends.

The resolution criteria are quite precise: a change of 4 points or more would trigger an "Increases" or "Decreases" resolution, while a change of 3 points or less would result in "Doesn't change". Given the specific timeframe is relatively short (12 days), I'll focus on recent healthcare trends and potential disruptive events that might impact search interest.
