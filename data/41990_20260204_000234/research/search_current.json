U.S. population growth slowed to approximately 0.5% in 2025, the weakest pace outside pandemic years, due to persistently low fertility and a historic decline in net international migration, with net immigration falling by more than half from 2024 levels. Globally, the World Health Organization (WHO) confirmed in its October 2025 Ageing and Health fact sheet that people aged 60 and older outnumbered children under five for the first time in 2020, marking a structural turning point. By 2030, one in six people worldwide will be aged 60 or older, compared to one in eight in 2015. This demographic shift is transforming healthcare consumption, fueling a trillion-dollar market: the global geriatric care services market, valued at $1.21 trillion in 2025, is projected to reach $2.12 trillion by 2034 at a 6.4% CAGR. Key pharmaceutical and medical device companies\u2014Boston Scientific (BSX), ResMed (RMD), AbbVie (ABBV), Amgen (AMGN), and Abbott (ABT)\u2014are capitalizing on this trend. Boston Scientific is advancing less-invasive cardiac rhythm management and neuromodulation therapies for seniors. ResMed is expanding AI-driven home-based sleep therapy, with FDA clearance for Smart Comfort in December 2025 and strong clinical evidence supporting CPAP use in reducing mortality. AbbVie secured FDA approval for VYALEV, the first 24-hour continuous subcutaneous levodopa infusion for Parkinson\u2019s, and is advancing tavapadon for earlier-stage patients. Amgen is strengthening its position in osteoporosis and cardiovascular care with Prolia, EVENITY, and Repatha, targeting high-risk older adults. Abbott launched Lingo, an over-the-counter biowearable based on FreeStyle Libre technology, enabling non-insulin users to monitor glucose without prescriptions, with a nationwide U.S. rollout in late 2025. Medtronic received FDA clearance in January 2026 for MiniMed Go, integrating InPen, Abbott\u2019s Instinct CGM, and AI dosing algorithms to provide real-time insulin guidance. The healthcare sector remains resilient during economic downturns due to stable demand for critical treatments, offering consistent revenues and defensive market positioning. These trends present long-term investment opportunities in pharmaceuticals, medical devices, home care, and digital health.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 05:26 PM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/silver-economy-boom-investing-healthcares-aging-tailwinds)\n\n**High Medical Cost Self-Payment Reviewed Every Two Years, Potential for Regular Increases**\nThe full details of a government-proposed healthcare reform bill were revealed on February 3, 2026, introducing a provision to review the patient cost-sharing cap under the high-cost medical care system at least every two years. The government aims to control the rising total healthcare expenditures driven by aging and advanced medical treatments, potentially leading to periodic increases in patient out-of-pocket costs. The bill explicitly states that the financial impact on households, particularly those with long-term treatment needs, must be considered during revisions. This follows the government\u2019s December 2025 decision to raise the monthly cap of the high-cost medical care system by up to 38% by August 2026. The increase is expected to reduce public insurance payouts and lower national insurance premiums. However, some opposition parties have opposed or expressed caution regarding the increase, making it a political issue in the upcoming House of Representatives election. The bill mandates that reviews consider medical cost trends, the financial health of the national health insurance system, and household burden. The explicit emphasis on long-term patients reflects a commitment to cautious deliberation. The government intends to finalize the bill through coordination with ruling party members before cabinet approval.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 12:24 PM\nSource:[\u795e\u6238\u65b0\u805e](https://www.kobe-np.co.jp/news/zenkoku/compact/202602/0019981457.shtml)\n\n**Strategic Developments at the Global Medical Tourism and Insurance Summit 2026 - Travel And Tour World**\nThe Global Medical Tourism and Insurance Summit is set to take place on May 13\u201314, 2026, in Florida, USA, serving as a high-level, closed-door forum for the global medical travel and insurance industry. The event brings together over 200 senior decision-makers, including CEOs of hospitals, insurance providers, government officials, and medical tourism facilitators, from the Middle East, Europe, Asia, Africa, and the Americas. Designed to foster strategic deal-making, the summit facilitates more than 1,000 one-to-one networking meetings, enabling outcome-driven discussions on international patient mobility, insurance coverage, and cross-border healthcare delivery. Attendees include leaders from UnitedHealthcare Global, Cigna, and hospital executives seeking to expand global patient programs. The summit\u2019s exclusivity\u2014limited attendance and strict access control\u2014ensures confidentiality, trust, and high-impact collaboration. It is widely regarded as the most influential closed-door gathering in the sector, with a 15-year legacy of shaping industry strategy. The 2026 edition is expected to focus on emerging trends in healthcare technology, patient safety, international accreditation, and innovative insurance models. Complimentary registration passes are occasionally offered to new Gold and Platinum members of the Medical Tourism Association to encourage fresh leadership engagement. The summit is not merely a conference but a critical platform where major industry deals are finalized and the future of global healthcare is shaped.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 12:17 PM\nSource:[Travel And Tour World](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/strategic-developments-at-the-global-medical-tourism-and-insurance-summit-2026/)\n\n**Only Two of Twenty Five Doctors Posted to Oti Report**\nMinister of Health Kwabena Mintah Akandoh expressed deep concern over the ongoing healthcare staffing crisis in Ghana\u2019s Oti Region, revealing that only two out of twenty-five medical doctors posted in 2025 have reported for duty. During a two-day working visit to Oti Region on February 1 and 2, 2026, Akandoh described the situation as a 'major setback' to healthcare delivery and called on Members of Parliament, Regional Ministers, and other stakeholders to collaborate on sustainable solutions. He rejected claims that rural postings are punitive, emphasizing that such assignments are essential for equitable healthcare access and that no health professional should view rural service as punishment. The Ministry of Health maintains that postings are non-negotiable and must follow the approved process\u2014those posted to Oti will go to Oti, as vacancies exist there. However, Akandoh acknowledged the need to improve living conditions and incentives to make rural postings more attractive, urging Metropolitan, Municipal and District Chief Executives (MMDCEs) to provide decent accommodation and support. He announced that the government has allocated six hundred million cedis in the 2026 budget for the construction of three regional hospitals, including the Oti Regional Hospital, with construction to begin once land documentation is finalized and litigation issues resolved. The minister also directed his Technical Advisor, Dr. Korku Awoonor, to establish a working group to conduct comprehensive audits of all Oti Region health facilities, assessing structural integrity, operational capacity, and productivity. During his visit, Akandoh toured Dambai Polyclinic, Worawora District Hospital, and Jasikan District Hospital, commending health workers for their dedication despite resource constraints. He announced the nationwide rollout of 24-hour cleaning services in public hospitals to improve patient experience and care quality. Akandoh stressed that improved infrastructure is a cornerstone of Universal Health Coverage (UHC), requiring shared responsibility between government and communities. The Oti Region crisis reflects a national trend: Ghana Health Service (GHS) data shows that seven out of every ten newly posted medical officers fail to report to assigned regions, with some areas recording zero arrivals. In December 2025, Akandoh issued a one-week ultimatum to non-reporting doctors, calling the situation 'worrying.' His visit followed a surprise inspection of Asesewa Government Hospital in the Eastern Region on February 1, 2026, as part of a broader government initiative to strengthen healthcare delivery and advance UHC.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 11:21 AM\nSource:[News Ghana](https://www.newsghana.com.gh/only-two-of-twenty-five-doctors-posted-to-oti-report/)\n\n**New National Access System for Appointments and Surgeries Violates Doctors' Privacy, Union Warns**\nThe Sindicato dos M\u00e9dicos do Norte (SMN), a union affiliated with the Federa\u00e7\u00e3o Nacional dos M\u00e9dicos (Fnam), warned on February 3, 2026, that the new Sistema Nacional de Acesso a Consultas e Cirurgia (Sinacc) violates doctors' right to privacy by requiring them to submit public declarations of interests and professional ties. The SMN criticized the system for replacing clinical judgment with administrative and economic criteria, arguing that it risks undermining equitable, transparent, and clinically based access to healthcare. According to the union, the Sinacc, which replaced the SIGIC system, allows hospital management boards to refer patients to private or social sectors based on cost rather than medical need, potentially directing patients to cheaper options regardless of clinical benefit. The SMN also condemned the requirement for annual public declarations of interests, calling it disproportionate, a form of administrative intimidation, and a breach of doctors' privacy. The system, approved by the government on October 24, 2025, and promulgated by the President of the Republic on January 9, 2026, enables patients to track their waitlist position and choose their treatment hospital. However, a January 2026 decree mandates that doctors must not act in favor of patients linked to their private practice and must submit public declarations of interests annually; failure to do so or providing false information will bar them from participating in clinical acts, referrals, or Sinacc registrations. The SMN rejected the 'demonization of doctors' and criticized the imposition of unnecessary bureaucracy and the shift from clinical to economic decision-making in healthcare.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 10:04 AM\nSource:[Publico](https://www.publico.pt/2026/02/03/sociedade/noticia/novo-sistema-acesso-consultas-cirurgias-viola-direito-privacidade-medicos-sindicato-2163452)\n\n**'Nothing Will Be Achieved Without You': CHPG Director Addresses Staff Ahead of New Hospital Opening in 2026**\nBeno\u00eete Rousseau de Sevelinges, Director of the Centre Hospitalier Princesse-Grace (CHPG), delivered her annual greetings to healthcare staff, emphasizing their exceptional dedication. The hospital achieved a perfect 100% score from France\u2019s Haute Autorit\u00e9 de Sant\u00e9 (HAS) in March 2025, earning the 'Haute qualit\u00e9 de soins' (High Quality of Care) distinction across three key areas: patient care, care teams, and the institution. Rousseau de Sevelinges credited the staff for making quality, safety, and humanity in care a daily practice, stating, 'This 100% is yours.' The year 2025 was described as 'dense, demanding, and sometimes exhausting,' marked by the retirement of 12 department heads (11 replaced, one vacancy in pneumology), the transition to the new CHPG, and rising hospital activity: a 5% increase in total admissions (19% since 2019), a 13% rise in conventional hospitalizations, and a 26% increase in day hospital admissions. The hospital now offers 23 multidisciplinary care pathways. Psychiatric admissions rose by 9%, patient recommendation rates reached a record 94% (+2%), and overall patient satisfaction rose from 84% in 2024 to 90.6%. The hospital launched 'Ambition 2025-2030,' a collaborative strategic framework promoting consultation, transversality, and trust. The first phase of the new CHPG, costing over \u20ac1.3 billion, will be handed over by the Mon\u00e9gasque State in April 2026. The move will take three months, with the first patient expected in September 2026. The director stressed, 'Nothing will happen without you. 100% involved. 100% supported.' She emphasized that the transformation will not be imposed but co-created with staff, aiming for 'rightness, safety, and sustainability' rather than immediate perfection. The second phase will be completed by 2032, expanding the facility to 110,000 m\u00b2 and 488 beds. A new department head will arrive in September 2026.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 05:16 AM\nSource:[Nice-Matin](https://www.nicematin.com/sante/rien-ne-se-fera-sans-vous-alors-que-le-premier-patient-est-attendu-en-septembre-2026-au-nouveau-chpg-sa-directrice-adresse-ses-vux-au-personnel-soignant-nchpg-le-premier-patient-attendu-en-septembre-2026-10667451)\n\n**Sina AI Hotspot Hourly Report: February 3, 2026 \u2013 Real-Time AI Developments in AGI, Healthcare, Robotics, and Finance**\nOn February 3, 2026, at 06:00, a real-time AI news update from Sina.com highlighted multiple developments in artificial intelligence. Google DeepMind's Chief AGI Scientist, Shane Legg, directly recruited an AI senior economist to study post-AGI economic challenges, emphasizing the need for expertise in economic modeling, agent-based simulation, public choice theory, and Python programming. In healthcare, Sichuan Provincial People's Political Consultative Conference member Dr. Tian Chao raised concerns about AI's role in medical training, stressing that clinical reasoning, patient communication, and emergency decision-making still require hands-on experience. Meta announced its 'AI Glasses Impact Grants' program, highlighting applications in agriculture, sports injury tracking, and creative education. Technological advancements include the GR-1 humanoid robot, equipped with six RGB cameras and BEV + Transformer + OCC technology for 360-degree environmental perception. AI tools like Kimi, Tencent Yuanbao, and DeepSeek are praised for productivity, while AI in neurosurgery and robotic surgery continues to advance. Financially, several funds\u2014Debang Fuxin, Chuangjin Hexin Technology Growth, Xingwo Inner Demand Growth, and Noah Positive Return\u2014reported declines on February 2, 2026, with performance varying significantly across funds. A growing trend of 'AI flattery' on social media was noted, driven by RLHF training and commercial incentives to increase user engagement, raising concerns about emotional manipulation. The article also promoted AI-powered IDEs like InsCode, integrating DeepSeek-V3, to accelerate robotic development.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 10:25 PM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_7857201856_1d45362c001901zuni.html)\n\n**County Hospitals Prepare Protest: 'System Collapse May Be Imminent'**\nOn March 3, 2026, a nationwide protest is scheduled in Warsaw by representatives of county hospitals and local governments, demanding urgent systemic decisions to prevent the collapse of some healthcare facilities. Organizers warn that without immediate intervention, many county hospitals may not survive the coming years due to an escalating financial and organizational crisis. They cite unpredictable system changes, uncoordinated closures of hospital departments\u2014including maternity wards\u2014without clear plans to ensure patient access to care in smaller towns. Financial instability is a major concern, with hospitals reporting underpriced medical service reimbursements and rising operational costs, including wages and energy. This has forced municipalities to either inject additional funds or face growing debt. Reports indicate a proposed 1 billion z\u0142oty annual program from the Bank Gospodarstwa Krajowego (BGK) to provide loans to indebted hospitals, with partial debt forgiveness conditional on implementing recovery plans\u2014though details remain unknown, hindering planning. Further consolidation plans, which would assign one hospital per 150,000\u2013200,000 residents (up from the current average of 60,000), raise fears of widespread closures and reduced access to medical care outside major cities. Maternity wards are especially at risk due to declining birth rates and insufficient reimbursement, forcing local authorities to close them despite public opposition. Critics also question proposed reforms like expanding birthing rooms and expanding specialized medical transport, arguing they are impractical without substantial additional funding.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 09:06 PM\nSource:[Do Rzeczy](https://dorzeczy.pl/zdrowie/840416/szpitale-powiatowe-szykuja-protest-moze-dojsc-do-zapasci-systemu.html)\n\n**CDC data show decline in hospital-related infections in 2024**\nA new report from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) shows that health care-associated infections (HAIs) in U.S. acute care hospitals declined in 2024, marking the third consecutive year of improvement following pandemic-driven increases in 2020 and 2021. According to the National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), which tracks HAIs across more than 38,000 facilities, central line-associated bloodstream infections dropped by 9%, catheter-associated urinary tract infections (CAUTIs) fell by 10%, hospital-onset Clostridioides difficile infections decreased by 11%, methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteremia declined by 7%, surgical site infections after colon surgery fell by 4%, and ventilator-associated events (VAEs) dropped by 2%. In long-term acute care hospitals, VAEs decreased by 23% and C. difficile infections by 15%. Inpatient rehabilitation facilities saw an 18% drop in C. difficile cases and an 8% decline in CAUTIs. At the state level, 17 states improved on at least two infection types in 2024 compared to 2023, and 50 states improved compared to the 2015 baseline. The CDC attributes the long-term decline since 2015 to enhanced infection prevention and control (IPC) measures and a 2015 CMS program that penalizes hospitals for poor performance on HAIs and preventable conditions. Despite progress, the CDC estimates that 1 in 31 hospitalized patients contracts an HAI daily. The report underscores the ongoing need for robust IPC practices to sustain gains. The 2024 decline follows two years of sharp increases during the peak of the COVID-19 pandemic, driven by resource strain, staffing shortages, and supply chain issues that increased opportunities for bacterial transmission, including antibiotic-resistant pathogens. A 2022 CDC report noted a 15% rise in infections and deaths from drug-resistant, hospital-acquired bacteria between 2019 and 2020.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 05:10 PM\nSource:[CIDRAP](https://www.cidrap.umn.edu/healthcare-associated-infections/cdc-data-show-decline-hospital-related-infections-2024)\n\n**The Revolution of Medical Visits: Sunday Hospital Lines in Ancona**\nOn Sunday, February 2, 2026, the INRCA hospital in Ancona experienced a significant shift in its usual routine, with long queues forming at the Cup service desks and in hospital departments. Instead of quiet visits, families were waiting to schedule specialist appointments and consult with doctors, marking a new trend in healthcare access. This change reflects a regional initiative by the Marche Region, led by Regional Health Assessor Paolo Calcinaro, to reduce waiting lists by offering medical services on weekends and holidays. The policy allows healthcare providers to schedule diagnostic exams and specialist visits on Saturdays, Sundays, and pre-holidays, improving access to care. This development marks a transformation in the Marche healthcare system, responding to public demand for more flexible and timely medical services.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 03:15 AM\nSource:[zazoom.it](https://www.zazoom.it/2026-02-02/la-rivoluzione-delle-visite-la-domenica-in-ospedale-ce-la-fila/18566961/)\n\n**Supporting The Health Of Your Healthcare Organization (UPDATED)**\n2025 was a year of divergence in healthcare M&A, marked by declining transaction volume but rising aggregate deal value driven by 'mega-deals' exceeding $1 billion. Strategic buyers and well-capitalized sponsors focused on physician specialties (oncology, gastroenterology, urology), dental services, behavioral health, and AI-enabled healthcare IT platforms. The lower-middle market faced sustained pressure due to regulatory, financing, and operational constraints, while rising costs\u2014especially from wage inflation, AI infrastructure, and cybersecurity investments\u2014strained margins. Regulatory headwinds, including the 'One Big Beautiful Bill' Act (OBBBA) Medicaid reforms and state-level restrictions on private equity influence, extended deal timelines and increased transaction costs. Despite these challenges, strategic alternatives like joint ventures, minority investments, and mergers of equals gained traction. For 2026, convergence is anticipated due to stabilized earnings, mounting exit pressure from private equity sponsors, record dry powder, and easing interest rates. Key trends include consolidation in post-acute care (ambulatory surgery centers, hospice, home health), sustained interest in AI-driven platforms for interoperability and value-based care, growth in remote monitoring and patient engagement technologies, and early-stage attention to longevity and wellness. Government advocacy will be critical amid OBBBA implementation and the expiration of ACA subsidies, which may increase the uninsured population and strain providers. Strategic buyers in healthcare and insurance will prioritize cost containment through narrow networks, formulary redesigns, and value-based care, requiring investment in digital health and data infrastructure. Payers face increased state oversight, particularly from PBMs, and heightened antitrust scrutiny due to the withdrawal of federal guidance and rising state approval requirements. Healthtech and AI adoption will accelerate across diagnostics, administrative processes, and patient engagement, raising privacy concerns under evolving state regulations. Disputes are expected to rise, including government investigations, qui tam actions, and litigation over AI in medical care\u2014already seeing early product liability cases. Healthcare restructuring will continue, with 12 companies filing Chapter 11 in Q3 2025, including Genesis Healthcare and Prospect Medical Holdings, and an increasing use of liability management exercises. Financially stable organizations are advised to leverage distressed asset opportunities for strategic growth.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 02:59 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/supporting-the-health-of-your-7497736/)\n\n**Healthcare Trends & Transactions: Year in Review - January 2026**\nAt the end of 2024, it was predicted that the healthcare mergers and acquisitions (M&A) market would accelerate in 2025 due to a combination of decreasing interest rates, a potential shift in the regulatory landscape under the new presidential administration, and increasing comfort with new state reporting requirements related to physician practice management (PPM) and other healthcare transactions.

BofA remains cautious on the hospital sector, projecting a 2-4% annual EBITDA headwind over the next five years from cuts in the Reconciliation Bill and the expiration of enhanced exchange subsidies. These pressures affect both hospital volumes and margins. While some new state-directed payment programs (SDPs) may be approved, BofA views their EBITDA impact as low quality due to future cuts. Universal Health Services Inc. (NYSE:UHS) and Ardent Health Inc. (NYSE:ARDT) are expected to be most affected, while HCA Healthcare Inc. (NYSE:HCA) is best positioned to mitigate risks. Additional policy risks loom if Medicare site neutrality reforms are reintroduced. Core hospital volume growth in 2026 is projected to be at or below the long-term midpoint, with a 90 basis point headwind from exchange and Medicaid policy changes likely pushing volumes below long-term expectations. The fourth quarter 2025 may see a temporary volume boost from demand pull-forward ahead of January 1, 2026, creating a difficult comparison for 2026. BofA favors post-acute providers due to minimal exposure to exchange and Medicaid cuts; Encompass Health Corporation (NYSE:EHC) is its top pick, citing high growth visibility and non-elective volume stability. Tenet Healthcare Corporation (NYSE:THC) is also a top pick due to its ambulatory surgery centers (ASCs) exposure, which insulates it from Reconciliation Bill impacts, with expectations of differentiated growth, debt reduction, and share buybacks. Brookdale Senior Living Inc. (NYSE:BKD) was upgraded to Buy from Underperform, with a price target raised from $6.75 to $13, based on improved free cash flow and favorable demographic trends.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 07, 2026 08:20 PM\nSource:[Benzinga News](https://www.benzinga.com/analyst-stock-ratings/analyst-color/26/01/49767225/hospitals-face-profit-squeeze-as-policy-risks-grow-analyst)\n\n**Silicon Valley\u2019s Allure Fades: Why Gen Z Now Prefers Healthcare Over Tech Jobs**\nA 2024 Career Interest Survey by the National Society of High School Scholars (NSHSS) reveals that nearly half of U.S. young adults now prefer careers in medicine or health-related fields over technology, marking a significant shift from Silicon Valley's former appeal. The survey shows hospitals and healthcare centers\u2014such as St. Jude Children\u2019s Research Hospital and Mayo Clinic\u2014are among the most desired employers, while tech giants like Google, Amazon, and Apple have lost their allure. Three in four young people would choose healthcare over a tech job. This change is driven by concerns over job insecurity due to artificial intelligence (AI), which is already automating tasks like coding and data analysis, and by widespread layoffs in the tech sector. Around two-thirds of respondents express anxiety about AI-driven job destruction and misuse of personal data. Young people now prioritize job stability, predictable schedules, health insurance, paid vacation, and mental well-being over prestige or high salaries. Healthcare is seen as a stable, purpose-driven field where human qualities like empathy and critical decision-making are irreplaceable by AI. This shift is linked to broader generational experiences, including the global pandemic and climate change, which have heightened concerns about health, human rights, and environmental sustainability. The trend is not a rejection of technology but a demand for its ethical, human-centered application\u2014using AI as a tool, not a replacement. This realignment reflects a pragmatic, values-driven vision of the future, where meaningful impact outweighs tech fame.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 04, 2026 01:18 PM\nSource:[Gizmodo en Espa\u00f1ol](https://es.gizmodo.com/el-sueno-de-silicon-valley-ya-no-seduce-a-los-jovenes-la-ia-los-despidos-y-por-que-la-generacion-z-prefiere-ahora-trabajar-en-hospitales-2000212956)\n\n**Outlook for 2026: Experian Health Releases Revenue Cycle Managem**\nExperian Health has released its 2026 predictions for the U.S. healthcare industry, highlighting five key trends shaping the sector. First, claim denials will remain a major financial challenge, with over one-third of providers reporting that 10% or more of claims are denied; despite AI's proven ability to reduce denials, only 14% of providers currently use it, citing a need for transparency and trust. Second, regulatory changes under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), effective in 2026 and fully implemented by 2027, are expected to increase the number of self-pay patients, with the Congressional Budget Office projecting 10 million more uninsured Americans by 2034; providers are unprepared, with 43% citing eligibility and 42% billing as critical areas needing improvement. Third, AI adoption will accelerate over the next six months, with use cases focused on data accuracy and patient engagement; 53% of providers believe AI will be widely adopted with oversight, and over a third see it as essential for operational efficiency. Fourth, the Interoperability and Prior Authorization Final Rule, taking effect in January 2026, will streamline prior authorizations for Medicare Advantage, Medicaid, CHIP, and Qualified Health Plans, reducing administrative burden and improving patient access to care. Fifth, up to 700 rural hospitals, clinics, and nursing homes may close due to financial strain from declining patient volumes, rising costs, workforce shortages, and shifts to outpatient and telehealth models; survival will depend on diversifying revenue, adopting telehealth and value-based care, and strengthening partnerships with larger health systems. Jason Considine, President at Experian Health, emphasized that 2026 will be a pivotal year of regulatory change and technology adoption, requiring trust, transparency, and thoughtful modernization of systems to improve healthcare outcomes and efficiency.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 15, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/4068940/outlook-for-2026-experian-health-releases-revenue-cycle-management-predictions)\n\n**Outlook for 2026: Experian Health Releases Revenue Cycle Management Predictions**\nExperian Health has released its 2026 predictions for the healthcare industry, highlighting five major trends shaping the revenue cycle: (1) Claim denials will remain a persistent challenge, with over one-third of providers reporting 10% or more of claims denied; despite AI's proven benefits, only 14% of providers currently use it for denials, underscoring the need for transparency and trust.

Key trends include rapid AI adoption in healthcare, particularly in administrative tasks like ambient dictation, though broader implementation faces resistance due to legacy systems and 'AI snake-oil' vendors. The Make American Health Again (MAHA) movement, led by US Secretary of Health Robert F. Kennedy Jr., will drive growth in prevention, longevity medicine, and lifestyle medicine, with direct-to-consumer testing companies like Function Health and Prenuvo gaining prominence. Real-world data on GLP1 drugs will intensify interest, revealing both safety concerns and new clinical uses, while increasing accessibility through telemedicine and falling cash prices. Medicare Advantage will continue expanding despite criticism, as it remains the only affordable option for most seniors, with traditional Medicare becoming financially unviable for low- and middle-income retirees. Patient discontent over medical debt, surprise billing, and insurance denials will escalate, paralleling rising frustration among healthcare workers due to wage stagnation and corporatization. Health plan consolidation will accelerate, with major mergers like Commonwealth Care Alliance joining CareSource and UCARE merging into Medica, driven by the need for scale. Digital health IPOs will surge in 2026, but many startups will face failure or face-saving mergers. Pharmaceutical industry antagonism will peak due to public distrust, vaccine skepticism, and initiatives like TrumpRX, despite ongoing medical innovation. Congressional healthcare reform will remain stagnant, with most proposals failing to pass despite widespread public demand, while regulatory changes from CMS and Dr. Mehmet Oz will drive incremental progress. Health equity, though sidelined in 2025, is expected to rebound as both a moral and business imperative, with initiatives resurging under new terminology. The article concludes with a reflective tone, questioning past predictions and inviting feedback on future accuracy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 12:30 PM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sachinjain/2025/12/01/top-10-healthcare-industry-predictions-for-2026/)\n\n**Q3 2025 Healthcare Services Public Comp Sheet and Valuation Guide | PitchBook**\nIn Q3 2025, public healthcare services companies showed a stark divergence in performance: provider stocks surged while payer stocks struggled. Providers benefited from elevated utilization across Medicaid, Medicare, and commercial populations, along with favorable reimbursement trends, driving a projected 5% EBITDA increase in 2025 after a 12% rise in 2024. In contrast, payers faced ongoing margin pressure, with EBITDA expected to decline another 15% in 2025 before stabilizing in 2026. CVS Health rose 68% year to date, supported by strong pharmacy benefit manager performance, while Medicaid-focused payers Centene and Molina Healthcare declined over 30%. UnitedHealth's shares were weighed down by leadership changes and regulatory scrutiny, whereas Oscar Health surged 41% due to investor interest in commercial-market growth.
