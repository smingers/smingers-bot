Most articles are about other stocks (BAX, Indian markets, crypto, Bank of America). Only one potentially relevant:

7. **Bank of America articles** - Multiple sources discussing BAC stock performance
   - Assessment: **Not relevant - these are about Bank of America (BAC), not Boeing (BA)**

**CRITICAL FINDING**: The Investopedia article dated Feb 3, 2026 states BA closed at **$174.99** on Feb 3, having fallen 2% that day and lost nearly one-third of value since start of 2026.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **BA Feb 3 closing price = $174.99** (from Investopedia, Feb 3, 2026) - This is our baseline
- **Stock down ~33% YTD 2026** (Investopedia) - Indicates severe negative momentum
- **Production targets confirmed**: 500 737s, 90-100 787s for 2026 (Flight Global, direct CEO/CFO quotes)
- **2025 performance strong**: 600 deliveries, 1,173 orders (CNBC) - Positive operational momentum

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Current production rate**: 42/month 737s, target 47/month by year-end (Flight Global)
- **Supply chain confidence**: CEO Ortberg stated supply chain "not going to be a big challenge" for next ramp (Flight Global)
- **Improved 2026 outlook** (DIGITIMES) - Industry publication consensus

**Weak Evidence:**
- Historical safety concerns (dated 2024 articles) - Already priced in
- Senate hearings (2024) - Old news, new CEO in place

**Evidence NOT found:**
- No mention of fuel control switch incident or Air India 787 grounding in provided sources
- No Singapore Airshow coverage in provided sources
- **The outside view analysis referenced sources that are NOT in the current information provided**

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: Feb 3, 2026 to Feb 13, 2026 = 10 calendar days (approximately 7 trading days, assuming normal market schedule)

**Baseline**: $174.99 (Feb 3 close per Investopedia)

**Key Temporal Factors**:
1. **Stock already down 33% YTD** - This is massive negative momentum entering the period
2. **Very short window** - Only 7 trading days for reversal
3. **Recent 2% drop on Feb 3** - Continuation of downward trend

**If timeframe halved (3-4 trading days)**:
- Probability would decrease to ~25-30% - insufficient time for any positive catalysts to materialize

**If timeframe doubled (14-16 trading days)**:
- Probability would increase to ~45-50% - more time for operational momentum news or mean reversion

## (d) Justification

**Critical Reassessment**: The outside view analysis referenced a Feb 3 price of $233.32 and discussed a safety incident that is NOT mentioned in any of the provided current sources. This suggests the outside view may have used sources not provided to me.

**Working with provided information only:**

**Bearish Factors**:
1. **Severe YTD decline (-33%)**: This is extreme and suggests major market concerns beyond normal volatility
2. **Recent momentum negative**: 2% drop on Feb 3 itself
3. **Short recovery window**: Only 7 trading days
4. **No positive catalysts identified** in provided sources for Feb 3-13 window

**Bullish Factors**:
1. **Strong operational fundamentals**: 600 deliveries in 2025, 1,173 orders, production ramping
2. **Executive confidence**: CEO/CFO expressing optimism on production targets
3. **Industry outlook positive**: DIGITIMES reports improved 2026 outlook
4. **Potential oversold**: -33% YTD is severe; some mean reversion possible

**Probability Reasoning**:

Starting from 50% base rate for a stock being higher over 7 trading days:

- **Adjustment for severe negative momentum (-33% YTD)**: -20%
  - This is extraordinary decline; suggests fundamental concerns or sector rotation
- **Adjustment for continued decline (2% on Feb 3)**: -8%
  - Recent price action confirms downward pressure
- **Adjustment for strong operational fundamentals**: +10%
  - Production and order data are solid
- **Adjustment for short timeframe**: -5%
  - Insufficient time for fundamentals to overcome momentum

**Net**: 50% - 20% - 8% + 10% - 5% = **27%**

**Calibration Considerations**:

The -33% YTD decline is the dominant factor. This level of decline in a major aerospace company in just over one month suggests either:
1. Sector-wide issues (tariffs, defense spending, economic concerns)
2. Company-specific problems not detailed in provided sources
3. Extreme market volatility/correction

Without knowing the cause, I must weight the momentum heavily. The strong operational data (orders, deliveries, production) provides some counterbalance, but typically takes longer than 7 days to reverse severe technical damage.

27% represents roughly 1:3 odds against, which seems appropriate given:
- Extreme recent negative momentum
- Short recovery window  
- Solid but not transformative positive fundamentals
- No specific positive catalysts identified for Feb 3-13 period

Probability calibration:

My inside view prediction is **27%**. This reflects high confidence that the severe negative momentum (-33% YTD, -2% on Feb 3) will persist through the short 7-day window, partially offset by strong operational fundamentals that could enable some recovery. The 27% acknowledges meaningful possibility of mean reversion or positive surprise, but weights the technical damage heavily.

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Boeing (BA) stock close higher on Feb 13, 2026 than its Feb 3, 2026 close of $174.99?

2. **Base rate**: 50% for neutral 7-day equity return; adjusted to 27% for severe negative momentum context

3. **Consistency**: "27 out of 100 times, BA closes above $174.99 on Feb 13 after being down 33% YTD and 2% on Feb 3." This seems reasonable - unlikely but possible.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - BA down 33% YTD through Feb 3 (very strong bearish)
   - BA down 2% on Feb 3 itself (moderate bearish)
   - Strong 2025 operational performance: 600 deliveries, 1,173 orders (moderate bullish)
   - CEO/CFO optimistic on 2026 production targets (weak-moderate bullish)
   - Only 7 trading days for recovery (structural bearish)

5. **Blind spot**: If BA announces major order win or positive regulatory development Feb 4-12, the stock could rally 5-10% quickly, making my forecast too pessimistic. However, no such catalysts identified in sources.

6. **Status quo**: Given extreme recent volatility (-33% YTD), status quo is continued decline or consolidation, not recovery. This supports bearish bias.

Probability: 27%
