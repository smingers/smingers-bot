Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis**

The provided sources fall into two categories: Boeing-specific articles and general market news.

**Boeing-specific sources:**

1. **DIGITIMES (30 Jan 2026)**: Reports Boeing's improved 2026 outlook driven by delivery improvements and production progress. Limited detail due to paywall. Quality: Medium (industry publication, but incomplete access).

2. **Flight Global (27 Jan 2026)**: Detailed production targets - 500 737s and 90-100 787s for 2026, current rates of 42/month and 8/month respectively. Named quotes from CFO Jesus Malave and CEO Kelly Ortberg. Quality: High (industry-specific publication with identifiable executive sources).

3. **CNBC (13 Jan 2026)**: Reports 2025 deliveries of 600 aircraft, net orders of 1,173 (first time outselling Airbus since 2018). Quality: High (major financial news outlet, verifiable data).

4. **Senate hearing articles (June 2024, Feb 2026)**: Multiple sources covering CEO testimony on safety issues, whistleblower allegations, and the Alaska Airlines door plug incident. These are historical context from 2024, not current market-moving news. Quality: High for factual reporting, but dated.

5. **Investopedia (3 Feb 2026)**: Reports BA stock fell 2% to $174.99 on 3 Feb 2026, down nearly one-third since start of 2026. Contains date inconsistencies (references 2024 events while dated 2026). Quality: Medium (concerning date errors suggest editorial issues).

**General market news (AskNews articles):**
Most articles discuss unrelated stocks (Baxter, Indian markets, Thai Baht, Bank of America). Only one directly mentions Boeing context but focuses on Bank of America. Quality: Low relevance to BA specifically.

**Key factual baseline:** BA closed at $174.99 on 3 Feb 2026 (per Investopedia). The question asks if the close on 13 Feb 2026 will be higher.

(b) **Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- **Production momentum (Flight Global, DIGITIMES)**: Multiple sources confirm Boeing is ramping production with specific targets (737: 42→47/month by year-end; 787: 8→10/month). CEO and CFO quotes support execution confidence. This provides fundamental positive catalyst. However, timeframe is year-end 2026, not immediate 8-day window.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **2025 delivery success (CNBC)**: 600 deliveries and outselling Airbus demonstrates operational recovery. However, this is backward-looking (2025 data) and likely priced in by 3 Feb 2026.
- **Recent negative momentum (Investopedia)**: Stock down ~33% YTD 2026 as of 3 Feb. This could indicate either oversold conditions (contrarian positive) or continued weakness (momentum negative).

**Weak evidence:**
- **Safety concerns (Senate hearings)**: While serious long-term issues, these are 2024 events already known to market. No new safety incidents reported in Feb 2026 sources.
- **Fuel-switch incident (Times of India, 1 Feb)**: Minor operational issue requiring fleet checks. Impact likely limited and possibly already reflected in 3 Feb price.

**Critical gap:** No information on immediate catalysts (earnings calls, analyst upgrades, major orders) between 3-13 Feb that would drive price movement in this specific 8-day window.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis**

**Timeframe:** 8 trading days (4-13 Feb 2026)

This is a very short window where:
- Fundamental catalysts (production ramps, deliveries) operate on quarterly/annual timescales
- Technical/momentum factors and random noise dominate
- Mean reversion from recent 33% YTD decline could provide modest support
- But no specific scheduled catalysts identified in this window

**If halved (4 days):** Would increase probability slightly toward status quo (~51-52%), as less time for drift or news.

**If doubled (16 days):** Would slightly increase probability of upward movement (~55-57%) as more time for mean reversion from oversold conditions and potential positive news flow.

(d) **Justification for Shifts from Outside View**

**Outside view base rate:** 53% (Boeing's historical 8-day positive hit rate, adjusted for post-earnings drift)

**Factors supporting upward adjustment (+2-3 ppt):**
1. **Extreme YTD decline (-33%)**: This magnitude of decline in 5 weeks suggests potential oversold conditions and mean reversion opportunity
2. **Positive fundamental trajectory**: Production ramp-up confirmed by multiple credible sources with executive quotes
3. **2025 operational success**: Outselling Airbus provides psychological support

**Factors supporting downward adjustment (-1-2 ppt):**
1. **No immediate catalysts**: 8-day window lacks scheduled events (earnings, air shows, major orders)
2. **Recent momentum clearly negative**: 2% decline on 3 Feb itself suggests selling pressure continues
3. **Safety overhang**: While priced in, ongoing scrutiny limits upside enthusiasm

**Net adjustment:** +1 ppt (modest upward shift)

The 33% YTD decline is the most compelling factor - this is extreme even for Boeing's volatile history and suggests some probability of technical bounce. However, the absence of specific near-term catalysts and continued negative momentum on 3 Feb itself prevents a larger adjustment. The 8-day window is too short for fundamental improvements to materially impact price through normal channels.

**Probability Calibration:**

Starting from outside view of 53%, I adjust upward by 1 percentage point to 54% based on:
- Oversold conditions (33% YTD decline) providing modest mean-reversion support
- Positive longer-term fundamentals creating floor
- Offset by lack of immediate catalysts and continued selling pressure

This modest adjustment reflects that in an 8-day window, random walk dominates but extreme recent decline tilts odds slightly toward bounce. The adjustment is small because:
- No earnings or major news scheduled
- Recent momentum (2% down on 3 Feb) suggests sellers still active
- Fundamental improvements operate on longer timeframes

A 54% probability means in 100 similar situations, BA would close higher 54 times - essentially a coin flip with slight positive tilt. This aligns with the weak evidence and short timeframe.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Boeing's closing price on 13 Feb 2026 exceed its 3 Feb 2026 close of $174.99? (8 trading days)

2. **Base rate:** 53% from Boeing's historical 8-day positive windows, adjusted for post-earnings drift.

3. **Consistency:** "54 out of 100 times, BA closes higher after 8 days." Yes, this reflects near-random walk with slight positive bias from oversold conditions.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - BA down 33% YTD by 3 Feb (extreme decline suggests oversold)
   - Production ramp confirmed by CEO/CFO (positive fundamentals, but long-term)
   - No immediate catalysts in 8-day window (limits upside drivers)
   - Recent 2% decline on 3 Feb shows continued selling pressure

5. **Blind spot:** Unexpected positive catalyst (major order announcement, analyst upgrade, FAA approval) could drive 5-10% rally, making 54% look too conservative. Conversely, new safety incident or production delay would validate lower probability.

6. **Status quo:** In 8 days with no scheduled catalysts, status quo (modest random movement around $175) is most likely. Extreme YTD decline provides slight upward bias, but not enough to overcome short timeframe limitations.

Probability: 54%
