- **Key Gap:** 10-day historical return statistics not computed, only methodology outlined.
- **Relevance:** High. Multiple catalysts clustered in the 10-day window, particularly Singapore Airshow (major order announcement venue).

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **10-day returns following earnings announcements with negative price action:**
   - Suitability: High. BA dropped ~6% on Feb 3 after earnings despite beating estimates, suggesting mixed sentiment.
   - Pattern: Stocks often continue drifting in the initial post-earnings direction for 3-5 days before mean-reverting or stabilizing.

2. **10-day returns during major aerospace trade shows (Singapore, Paris, Farnborough):**
   - Suitability: High. Singapore Airshow runs Feb 3-8, covering most of our window.
   - Pattern: OEMs typically announce orders, generating positive sentiment. However, Boeing's recent safety news may dampen this effect.

3. **General 10-day returns for BA stock (unconditional):**
   - Suitability: Moderate. Without computed statistics, we must rely on general market behavior.
   - Pattern: For large-cap stocks, 10-day movements are roughly normally distributed with slight positive drift (~0.5-1% over 10 trading days in normal markets).

4. **10-day returns following negative safety news:**
   - Suitability: Moderate-High. The Feb 3 fuel switch incident is breaking news.
   - Pattern: Safety incidents typically create 1-3 day selling pressure, then stabilization unless regulatory action escalates.

**Selected Reference Class:** Combination of post-earnings drift + trade show catalyst + safety news overlay.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction Window:** 10 calendar days (Feb 3-13, 2026) = approximately 8 trading days (excluding weekends Feb 8-9).

**Starting Point:** Feb 3 close at $233.32, down from $248.43 pre-earnings (6.1% decline).

**Historical Patterns (General Market Knowledge):**
- 8-trading-day movements for large-cap stocks typically range ±3-5% in normal volatility environments
- Post-earnings drift can extend 5-10 days
- Trade show announcements can generate 2-4% single-day pops on major order news
- Safety incidents create 1-3% downward pressure over 2-3 days

**Key Events Within Window:**
- Feb 3-8: Singapore Airshow (potential positive catalyst)
- Feb 3: Safety incident news breaks (negative catalyst, same day)
- Feb 5-7: Likely January orders release (could be positive given 1,100+ orders in 2025)
- Feb 6: US Factory Orders data
- Feb 13: Question resolution

**(d) Justification:**

**Bullish Factors (favor "Yes" - price rises):**
1. Strong operational momentum: 600 deliveries, 1,100+ orders, $567B backlog
2. Singapore Airshow provides platform for positive order announcements
3. January orders data likely shows continued strength
4. Stock already corrected 6% post-earnings, potentially oversold
5. Recent 38.9% 12-month gain suggests positive trend
6. Production ramp narrative (42→47→52/month) supports growth story

**Bearish Factors (favor "No" - price falls or flat):**
1. Immediate post-earnings selling pressure (down 6% on Feb 3)
2. Breaking safety news on Feb 3 regarding fuel switch malfunction
3. Revived scrutiny of June 2025 fatal crash
4. Air India fleet-wide grounding creates headline risk
5. Supply chain and Spirit integration challenges acknowledged by CEO
6. Market may be digesting recent gains (up 38.9% over 12 months)
7. Analyst sentiment cautious (HOLD ratings, not strong buys)

**Net Assessment:**
The 10-day window presents competing forces. The post-earnings decline and safety news create immediate downward pressure, but the Singapore Airshow and strong operational fundamentals provide upside potential. The safety incident is concerning but appears contained (one aircraft, no injuries, proactive response). Historically, trade shows have been positive catalysts for Boeing.

The question asks if Feb 13 close will be HIGHER than Feb 3 close ($233.32). Given:
- 8 trading days for mean reversion from oversold post-earnings level
- Major trade show in first half of window
- Safety news likely priced in within 2-3 days
- Strong underlying fundamentals

The probability slightly favors a positive outcome, but it's close to a coin flip given the negative starting momentum.

**Outside view calibration:**

Without computed historical 10-day return statistics, I must calibrate based on:

1. **General market behavior:** Large-cap stocks have approximately 52-55% probability of positive returns over any random 8-10 trading day period (slight positive drift in equity markets).

2. **Post-earnings pattern:** Stocks declining immediately after earnings have ~45-48% probability of recovering within 10 days (slight mean reversion, but momentum can persist).

3. **Trade show effect:** Major aerospace shows historically boost sentiment, adding perhaps 5-8 percentage points to base probability.

4. **Safety news discount:** Recent negative headlines subtract perhaps 3-5 percentage points.

**Rough calculation:**
- Base probability: 52%
- Post-earnings negative momentum: -5%
- Trade show catalyst: +7%
- Safety news: -4%
- Net: 52% - 5% + 7% - 4% = 50%

This suggests near-even odds. However, the operational strength (600 deliveries, record orders) and the timing of Singapore Airshow in the first half of the window provide slight upward bias. The safety incident, while serious, appears manageable and Air India's proactive response may limit damage.

**Calibration considerations:**
- 50% = even odds (coin flip)
- 55% = slight edge to "Yes"
- 60% = meaningful but not strong conviction
- 45% = slight edge to "No"

Given the balanced factors with marginal bullish tilt from trade show timing and operational momentum, I calibrate toward 53-56% range.

**Outside View Prediction:**
54%
