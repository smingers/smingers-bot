Analysis:
**1) Restate question / resolution mechanics**
This resolves **Yes** iff **BA’s Yahoo Finance close on 2026-02-13** is **strictly higher** than **BA’s Yahoo Finance close on 2026-02-03** (today’s close). Otherwise **No**.

## (a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; facts vs opinions)

1) **DIGITIMES (Jan 30, 2026) – “more positive operating outlook for 2026” (paywalled preview)**
- **Quality/date:** Medium; industry-relevant but **paywall-limited** and short on verifiable details in the excerpt.
- **Facts:** Claims Boeing earnings indicated improved 2026 operating outlook; supply is the constraint.
- **Opinions/interpretation:** “More positive” is directionally bullish but lacks numbers; limited for a 10-day stock move.

2) **FlightGlobal (Jan 27, 2026) – production ramp plans**
- **Quality/date:** High for aerospace operations reporting; named executives; concrete targets.
- **Facts:** Targets ~10% higher 2026 deliveries vs 2025; ~500 737s; 90–100 787s; current rates 42/month (737) and 8/month (787); planned ramps (47/month, 10/month); FAA approvals required; Max 7/10 certification hoped in 2026.
- **Opinions:** Executive quotes about supply chain not being a big challenge—optimistic but attributable and checkable over time.
- **Relevance:** Medium for a 10-day horizon (sets **fundamental narrative**; not necessarily a near-term catalyst unless tied to imminent announcements).

3) **CNBC (Jan 13, 2026) – orders/deliveries strength**
- **Quality/date:** High; mainstream financial journalism; specific numbers.
- **Facts:** 2025 net orders Boeing 1,173 vs Airbus 889; 2025 deliveries 600; December deliveries 63; large Alaska 737 MAX order; Delta 787 order.
- **Opinions:** Minimal; mostly factual.
- **Relevance:** Moderate—supports bullish medium-term sentiment; weakly predictive for 8 trading days absent a new datapoint.

4) **Clifford Law Offices (Jun 18, 2024) – senate hearing / legal framing**
- **Quality/date:** Low–medium for forecasting price; it’s a **plaintiff law firm** perspective and advocacy-oriented; dated 2024 (historical context).
- **Facts:** Hearing occurred; safety culture criticisms; DOJ/DPA context.
- **Opinions:** Strongly framed against Boeing (expected from source).
- **Relevance:** Low direct relevance to 2026-02 short horizon except as background “reputational overhang.”

5) **Investopedia (Feb 03, 2026) – hearing recap; stock reaction**
- **Quality/date:** Medium-high; mainstream explainer; **most time-relevant** (today).
- **Facts:** Reports BA shares **fell ~2%** and **closed at $174.99** on Feb 3; describes new whistleblower allegations; investigations; hearing details.
- **Potential issue:** Article contains a **date inconsistency** about Calhoun stepping down “end of 2024” while dated 2026; however the **market close figure and the day’s move** are the key actionable items here.
- **Relevance:** High: establishes that **today’s tape is negative**, and that **headline risk is live** during the forecast window.

6) **Al Jazeera (Jun 6, 2024) – safety crisis, DOJ scrutiny (historical)**
- **Quality/date:** High journalism, but old (2024).
- **Facts:** Summarizes whistleblower claims, DOJ accusations, criminal investigation context.
- **Opinions:** Some political framing/quotes from Sen. Blumenthal (identifiable).
- **Relevance:** Low for 10-day move, except that safety/regulatory scrutiny is a recurring theme that can resurface.

7) **AskNews article list**
- None of the listed AskNews snippets are directly about **Boeing (BA)**; they’re largely about other tickers/markets.  
- **Relevance:** Essentially none for this question.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted drivers for “Feb 13 close > Feb 3 close?”)

### Strong evidence
- **Today’s negative headline + negative price action (Investopedia, Feb 3)**: BA down ~2% on the day with active whistleblower/safety scrutiny.  
  **Mechanism:** regulatory/legal/safety headlines can drive short-term risk-off positioning.  
  **Effect on probability:** shifts toward **No** (continued drift down) but not determinative.

### Moderate evidence
- **Operational/industry momentum (CNBC; FlightGlobal; DIGITIMES preview)**: deliveries/orders improving; credible production ramp narrative.  
  **Mechanism:** supports valuation and can cushion dips; may attract “buy-the-dip” flows after declines.  
  **Effect:** modest shift toward **Yes** (bounce/reversion), though timing is uncertain.

- **Constraints & approvals (FlightGlobal)**: FAA approvals needed for rate increases; certifications hoped in 2026.  
  **Mechanism:** reminds market of execution/regulatory gating—reduces confidence in near-term upside.  
  **Effect:** modest shift toward **No** (limits upside surprise).

### Weak evidence
- **2024-era hearing/legal pieces (Clifford Law; Al Jazeera)**: mostly background.  
  **Effect:** slight tilt to **No** as persistent overhang, but weakly time-linked.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Window:** From **2026-02-03 close** to **2026-02-13 close** (~10 calendar days; typically ~8 trading days).
- **If halved (~4 trading days):** I’d lean a bit more **No** (negative news momentum tends to persist a few days; less time for reversion).
- **If doubled (~16 trading days):** I’d lean more **Yes** (more time for mean reversion and for fundamentals/order/production narrative to reassert).

## (d) Justification: updating the outside view (54%) to an inside view
**Outside view base rate given:** 54% “Yes”.

**Key inside-view updates:**
1) **Starting point appears to be a down day tied to safety/whistleblower scrutiny (Feb 3).** That raises the odds of near-term negative drift and volatility. (Downward adjustment.)
2) **However, much of the “good 2026 outlook” is not a discrete catalyst within the next 8 trading days**; it’s more of a slow-moving narrative. (Limits upward adjustment.)
3) **Boeing is a headline-sensitive stock**; in a short window, idiosyncratic news (additional allegations, regulatory steps, incident reports) dominates. Given we already have such headlines today, the distribution is a bit negatively skewed. (Downward adjustment.)

Net: I trim the base rate modestly from 54% toward a near-coinflip but slightly below the outside-view number.

Probability calibration
- **Outside view:** 54%
- **Adjustments:**  
  - Ongoing high-salience safety/whistleblower scrutiny **in the exact start day’s news cycle**: **-3 to -5 pts**  
  - Underlying operational momentum (orders/deliveries/production ramp) as a “floor”: **+1 to +2 pts**
- **Inside view result:** **53% → 50% range**. I’ll take **51%** to reflect near-even odds with mild negative skew but meaningful bounce potential over 8 trading days.

Checklist:
1) **Paraphrase:** Resolve Yes if BA’s 2026-02-13 close (Yahoo) > BA’s 2026-02-03 close (Yahoo); else No.  
2) **Outside view base rate:** 54% Yes.  
3) **Consistency:** 51 out of 100 times, BA’s Feb 13 close is higher than its Feb 3 close.  
4) **Top evidence (3–5):**
   - Feb 3: BA down ~2% amid hearing/whistleblower safety allegations (headline risk).
   - Production/delivery ramp targets for 2026 (FlightGlobal) support medium-term narrative/floor.
   - 2025 orders/deliveries improved (CNBC), but not necessarily a near-term catalyst.
5) **Blind spot:** A single new safety incident/regulatory escalation (or large order announcement) could dominate and swing price several percent.  
6) **Status quo:** In ~8 trading days, absent major new info, direction is close to 50/50; today’s negative news slightly nudges below base rate.

Probability: 51%
