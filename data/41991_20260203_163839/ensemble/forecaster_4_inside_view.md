Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most-to-least relevant to the 10-day window)

1. Investopedia, 3 Feb 2026 – factual close price $174.99, –2 % daily move, states YTD loss ≈-33 %.  High-quality factual market data; opinions limited to senators/CEO comments (ignore for price-forecast).

2. FlightGlobal, 27 Jan 2026 – confirms 2026 production-rate plans (+10 % deliveries, new assembly line).  Reliable trade journal; forward-looking but from named executives (CFO, CEO).  Moderately bullish for medium term, limited direct 10-day impact except as sentiment ballast.

3. DIGITIMES, 30 Jan 2026 – headline of “more positive operating outlook”.  Pay-walled; only gist available.  Weak evidence but directionally positive.

4. CNBC, 13 Jan 2026 – 2025 orders > Airbus for first time since 2018; 600 deliveries.  Well-sourced; medium-term bullish narrative, only minor 10-day influence.

5. Investopedia, 3 Feb 2026 (Senate hearing recap) – fresh safety headlines, whistle-blower claims.  Reliable outlet; clearly negative but mostly already known and arguably priced in (stock already fell).

6. Misc. 2024-2025 safety-hearing articles – historic background; largely priced-in.  Weak incremental evidence.

Other AskNews articles supplied are not BA-specific and have no bearing on Boeing’s price; ignored for scoring.

(b) Evidence weighting toward “BA will be HIGHER on 13 Feb 2026”

Positive (moderate)

• Post-earnings/senate-hearing sell-off leaves price 33 % below 1 Jan; mean-reversion in next 8–9 trading days plausible.

• Singapore Airshow (3–6 Feb) – historically an order-announcement venue; any large-order headline usually lifts BA 1-3 %.

• FlightGlobal & DIGITIMES pieces show management guiding for production ↑ in 2026 – supports “buyers on dips” narrative.

Negative (moderate)

• Ongoing 737 MAX grounding & FAA scrutiny; any fresh adverse finding could hit stock 3-5 % intraday.

• Whistle-blower stories amplified in 3 Feb senate hearing keep headline-risk elevated.

Neutral / weak

• General market drift is slightly positive over two-week spans (~52 % of the time for large-caps).

Overall, positives and negatives are roughly balanced, but the recent sharp draw-down plus imminent air-show skew risk/reward modestly to the upside.

(c) Time-frame analysis

Horizon: 10 calendar / 8–9 trading days.

If halved (≈ 4 trading days): news-flow uncertainty smaller, drift closer to 50 %; I would drop probability ~3 ppts to 52 %.

If doubled (≈ 18 trading days): more macro & FAA decisions feed in; additional variance pushes forecast toward 51 % (closer to random).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view base rate (large-cap single stocks, 8–10 trading days): 52 % chance of finishing higher.

Inside-view shifts:

+2 ppts: Post-sell-off mean-reversion tendency after large one-day drop (empirical ~55 % up next 10 sessions).

+2 ppts: Potential positive order headlines from Singapore Airshow (historic conditional uplift, albeit uncertain).

–1 ppt: Elevated headline/FAA risk from safety probes.

Net adjustment: +3 ppts → 55 %.

Probability calibration
Final inside-view probability that BA’s 13 Feb 2026 close > 3 Feb 2026 close: 55 %.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will Boeing (BA) close higher on 13 Feb 2026 than on 3 Feb 2026? 8-9 US trading days.”  
2. Outside-view base 52 %.  
3. Consistency – “55 of 100 times BA would finish higher eight trading days later.”  Feels plausible.  
4. Key evidence: a) 3 Feb close $174.99 after –33 % YTD drop; b) Singapore Airshow likely order news; c) Production-ramp guidance (FlightGlobal); d) Senate-hearing safety headlines already knocked price.  
5. Blind-spot – An unexpected FAA mandate extends MAX grounding, triggering another >5 % slide.  Would favor “No.”  
6. Status-quo – Short-horizon idiosyncratic volatility ≈ symmetrical; small nudge toward 50/50 already reflected.

Probability: 55%
