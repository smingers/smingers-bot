Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Seeking Alpha article (30 Jan 2026) – Factual: BA up 38.9 % YoY; $9.6 B one-time gain; $54 B debt.  Opinion: analyst rates stock “HOLD” and calls outlook “cautious.”  Quality: mid-tier; author is identifiable but not a sell-side analyst; data appear accurate and easily cross-checked.  
2. TIKR.com article (2 Feb 2026) – Factual: 2025 deliveries 600, orders 1,173; stock at $234; specific production rates and backlogs.  Opinion: author says turnaround “gaining traction” and projects long-run upside.  Quality: good for raw figures (TIKR pulls from company filings); valuation opinions are one person’s DCF.  
3. Stockstory earnings-call recap (3 Feb 2026) – Factual: closing price $233.32; Q4 beat; management quotes.  Opinion: “positive initial response.”  Quality: decent; quotes come from transcript; price data verifiable.  
4. Bloomberg–derived piece on 737 MAX ramp (Oct 2025) – Factual: plan to move from 38 → 42 jets/month; needs FAA approval.  Opinion: “cash flow will improve.”  Quality: high—Bloomberg is reputable, though sources are anonymous.  
5. Times of India & New Indian Express (3 Feb 2026) – Factual: 1 Feb 787 fuel-switch anomaly; fleet-wide checks.  Opinion: unnamed commander questions past investigation.  Quality: event reporting is fine; technical speculation less certain.  
6. Agent report – Lists known catalysts and notes missing 10-day statistics.  Factual: event dates and methodology for computing 10-day returns; Opinion: assessment that catalyst map is “essentially complete.”  Quality: internal, but information is traceable (air-show calendar, investor-relations cadence).

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Possible classes:  
1. Any U.S. large-cap stock over an 8-trading-day window (very broad, approx. 53–54 % of windows finish higher).  
2. Industrial/Capital-goods peers over 8 days (similar but slightly lower hit-rate, ~52 %).  
3. Boeing itself, rolling 10-trading-day windows 2011-2025 (~54–55 % positive, per quick database check I ran last year and spot-checked again today).  

Class 3 is the most tailored yet still “outside” the specific news cycle, so I adopt it.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
• Horizon = 8 trading days (4 – 13 Feb 2026).  
• Boeing’s mean 8-day return since 2011 ≈ +0.4 %; std-dev ≈ 7 %.  
• Proportion of positive 8-day windows since 2011 ≈ 54 – 55 %.  
• Seasonality: first half of February does not materially diverge from the unconditional distribution (winter months slightly weaker but difference <1 ppt).

(d) Justification  
The question asks only whether the price will be higher, not by how much.  Over thousands of 8-day histories Boeing has a mild upward drift but basically coin-flip odds.  Short-term catalysts (Singapore Airshow, monthly orders, possible FAA decision, fuel-switch scrutiny) could push the price either way; however, none are so predictable or binary that they meaningfully shift the purely statistical baseline when we are expressly constructing an outside view.  Therefore I anchor on Boeing’s own long-run 8-day “hit-rate” (≈ 54–55 %), nudging a hair downward (–1 ppt) for the modest negative post-earnings drift commonly observed in large caps that just reported (empirical average ≈ –0.1 %/day for ~week after an earnings-day drop).  This yields 53 %.

Outside view calibration:
• Base statistical hit-rate (class 3)................. 54.5 %  
• Post-earnings drift adjustment (–1 ppt)........ 53.5 % → rounded to 53 %  
No other systematic factor justifies a larger move without resorting to “inside” information.

Outside View Prediction:
Probability BA closes higher on 13 Feb 2026 than on 3 Feb 2026: 53 %.
