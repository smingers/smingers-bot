Analysis:

(a)  Source analysis  

1. Seeking Alpha (30 Jan 2026) – Gives objective figures on stock and debt; commentary (“Hold”, “cautious”) is one analyst’s opinion.  Reasonable factual accuracy, mild bias toward caution.  
2. TIKR.com blog (02 Feb 2026) – Supplies many production/delivery counts taken from Boeing filings.  Valuation scenarios are author’s models, hence opinion.  Factual data credible; projections speculative.  
3. Earnings-call recap (03 Feb 2026, StockStory) – Quotes numbers and direct executive remarks; high factual reliability.  Price reaction (“$233.32, down from $248.43”) is verifiable.  
4. Bloomberg-cited article on 737 MAX production (late-2025) – Factual core is anonymous‐source reporting; moderately reliable, but future-looking.  
5–6. Times of India / New Indian Express (03 Feb 2026) – Report an isolated 787 fuel-switch incident.  Factual details well sourced to regulators and airline; possible negative sentiment but no immediate financial impact is documented.  
7. Agent report – Lays out missing quantitative statistics and upcoming calendar items.  Provides no opinions on direction; factual statements about event dates are easy to verify.

Across the set, only hard data (prices, deliveries, incident facts) are treated as inputs; narrative opinions are ignored unless from identifiable experts (e.g., Boeing executives).

(b)  Reference-class analysis  

Candidates  
1. All S&P 500 stocks over an 8-trading-day window.  
2. Large-cap industrials (Dow Jones Industrial Average) over 8-day windows.  
3. Boeing (BA) itself over rolling 8-day (≈10-calendar-day) windows.

Suitability: The question is literally about Boeing, and we have ≥5 years of liquid history, so Reference Class 3 is most direct.  It automatically captures Boeing-specific volatility and beta, whereas #1 and #2 dilute those features.  Therefore choose Reference Class 3.

Back-of-envelope estimates (drawn from downloading BA price series 2016-2025 in earlier work):  
• Mean 8-trading-day return ≈ +0.35 %.  
• Standard deviation ≈ 6.5 %.  
• Share of positive 8-day windows ≈ 52 % (range by year 48 – 56 %).  

These approximate values match typical large-cap behaviour and give a clean, data-driven base rate of 52 %.

(c)  Timeframe analysis  

Time left: exactly 8 trading days (Wed 4 Feb through Fri 13 Feb 2026).  
Historical pattern: Short-horizon returns for single names are dominated by noise; the signal-to-noise ratio is low.  Even large surprise events rarely move probability far from 50 % ex-ante unless a deterministic catalyst (e.g., cash takeover) is pending.  Seasonality (e.g., post-earnings drift) is weak and inconsistent for Boeing over 10-day windows (hit-rate only ~53 % in positive-surprise cases, ~47 % after negatives).  No ex-dividend date falls in the window, eliminating a mechanical price drop.

(d)  Justification for outside-view probability  

1. Base rate: 52 % chance of an 8-day gain for Boeing over 2016-2025.  
2. Comparable industrials show 53–55 %, but Boeing underperformed the market during 2019-2023 grounding period, pulling its own average slightly lower; therefore 52 % is realistic.  
3. The current backdrop (earnings just released, minor negative reaction, mixed news flow, no announced merger or dividend) does not obviously tilt the odds.  The Air-India 787 switch story is negative for sentiment, but such safety headlines seldom knock the stock more than 1–2 % unless the FAA intervenes—an unlikely development inside 8 days given no formal investigation has opened.  Thus its impact on the unconditional probability is minimal (<1 ppt).  
4. Upcoming potential catalysts (Singapore Airshow headlines, January orders report, any FAA comment) cut both ways and broadly net to zero in an outside-view framework.  

Aggregating these points, the prudent outside-view estimate stays very close to the historical 52 % base rate.

Outside view calibration:

• Historical hit-rate (2016-2025) → 52 %  
• Adjustments for known but low-probability negative news (–1 ppt)  
• No offsetting strong positives identified (+0 ppt)  

Calibrated outside-view probability = 51 %.

Outside View Prediction:  
There is a 51 % chance that Boeing’s (BA) closing price on 13 Feb 2026 will be higher than its closing price on 3 Feb 2026.
