# Summary of "Boeing may raise 737 MAX production to 42 jets: Bloomberg"

**Key Facts and Statistics:**

- Boeing is reportedly preparing to increase 737 MAX production from the current limit of 38 jets per month to 42 jets per month, potentially as soon as October 2025
- The company plans to maintain the 42-jet-per-month rate for approximately six months before seeking further increases
- Additional production increases are planned for April 2025 and late 2026
- Combined increases could potentially raise production to around 53 jets per month by the end of 2026
- The current 38-jet-per-month production cap was set by the FAA in early 2024 following the January 5, 2024 Alaska Airlines door plug incident on a 737 MAX 9

**Opinions from Named/Reliable Sources:**

- According to Bloomberg (citing anonymous sources familiar with Boeing's plans): Boeing intends the gradual increase to avoid overpressuring mechanics and suppliers
- Boeing executives indicated (per Bloomberg): The manufacturer's cash flow will begin to improve as 737 production increases
- FAA statement to Bloomberg: "Safety drives everything we do. The FAA will continue oversight of Boeing's production processes and work with the company to determine if it can safely increase production."

**Additional Context:**

- Boeing must secure FAA approval to verify that its Seattle-area factories can sustain higher output while maintaining quality
- Accelerating production is described as essential for Boeing to reduce debt and improve its financial situation
- The FAA recently returned limited certification authority to Boeing for issuing airworthiness certificates for 737 MAX and 787 aircraft
- Boeing denied a September 30, 2025 Wall Street Journal report claiming it was developing a new single-aisle aircraft to replace the 737 MAX

# Summary of Article: "AI Boeing fuel switch cuts off again, this time at UK airport"

**Source:** The Times of India, February 3, 2026

## Key Facts and Events:

1. **Incident Details:**
   - On February 1, 2026, at London Heathrow Airport, an Air India Boeing 787 (VT-ANX) operating flight AI-132 to Bengaluru experienced a fuel control switch issue
   - During engine start, a pilot lightly pushed the left fuel control switch to test if its lock feature was working
   - The switch moved from "run" to "cut-off" without the required lift action (a two-step safety feature designed to prevent inadvertent fuel shutdown)
   - The switch failed to lock properly on the second attempt but worked correctly on the third attempt
   - The aircraft departed at 9:40 pm and is currently grounded in Bengaluru

2. **Connection to Previous Fatal Crash:**
   - This incident has implications for the investigation of the June 12, 2025 fatal Air India Boeing 787 crash in Ahmedabad
   - In that crash, both fuel control switches moved from "run" to "cut-off" seconds after takeoff
   - Cockpit voice recorder captured one pilot asking why the other cut off fuel, with the other pilot denying doing so

3. **Previous Investigation Findings:**
   - India's Aircraft Accident Investigation Bureau (AAIB) preliminary report from July stated no technical or design flaw was found "so far," implying pilot action
   - DGCA subsequently mandated inspection of fuel switch locking systems
   - Air India announced it completed these inspections and found no faults

4. **Historical Context:**
   - In 2018, the US aviation regulator cautioned that fuel control switches on Boeing 787s could malfunction and lead to inadvertent engine shutdown

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

**Senior Commander (unnamed):**
- The London incident "directly challenges the assumption that fuel switch movement in the Air India crash was manual"
- The cut-off transition was previously "treated as near-conclusive evidence of pilot action"
- The incident shows "uncommanded switch behaviour, through mechanical detent failure, signal corruption or other causes, is a credible failure mode"
- Places DGCA's earlier fleet clearance claim "under sharp scrutiny"
- Suggests inspections "may have been visual, non-diagnostic, or incomplete"
- States: "fuel cutoff can no longer be equated with intent"

**Capt Amit Singh (Air Safety Expert):**
- Called the incident "particularly concerning" given the 2018 US aviation regulator warning
- The incident occurring after Air India checked its fleet's fuel control switches "raises serious questions about inspection adequacy"
- "demands the highest level of regulatory scrutiny"

## Official Statements:

**Air India:**
- Confirmed awareness of pilot report about possible defect
- Grounded the aircraft and involving Boeing (OEM) for priority checking
- Communicated matter to DGCA
- Reiterated that it had checked fuel control switches on all Boeing 787 aircraft after DGCA directive and "found no issues"

**Boeing:**
- Stated: "We are in contact with Air India and are supporting their review of this matter"

## Context Information:
- Boeing's last close price as of February 1, 2026 was $233.72 (per the background information provided)

# Summary of Article: Air India orders fleet-wide checks on Boeing 787s after fuel switch glitch

**Date:** February 03, 2026  
**Source:** The New Indian Express

## Key Facts and Events:

1. **Incident Details:**
   - Air India reported a fuel control switch malfunction on a Boeing 787 Dreamliner operating a London Heathrow–Bengaluru flight on February 1, 2026
   - The left engine fuel control switch did not remain firmly locked in the "run" position and appeared to move toward "cutoff" during engine start
   - The aircraft completed the flight safely with no passenger impact
   - Air India grounded the affected plane and informed the DGCA and Boeing

2. **Company Response:**
   - Air India initiated fleet-wide inspections of fuel control switches across its Boeing 787 Dreamliner fleet
   - Internal assessments so far have not identified similar defects on planes already checked
   - Operations continue normally except for the affected aircraft
   - The airline acted proactively without waiting for a regulatory directive

3. **Historical Context:**
   - This incident revives scrutiny of a June 2025 Ahmedabad crash of an Air India 787 Dreamliner
   - In that fatal crash, investigators found both engine fuel control switches had moved to the cutoff position shortly after takeoff, causing catastrophic loss of thrust
   - Following that accident, Indian aviation authorities had directed operators to check switch mechanisms on relevant aircraft types, including the Boeing 787
   - Air India had reported no abnormalities detected during those earlier inspections

4. **Technical Details from Ministry of Civil Aviation:**
   - During engine start in London, crew observed the fuel control switch did not remain positively latched in "RUN" position when light vertical pressure was applied (on two occasions)
   - On the third attempt, the switch latched correctly and remained stable
   - No abnormal engine parameters, cautions, warnings, or system messages were observed during the flight
   - Post-landing inspection found both switches satisfactory with locking mechanisms fully seated
   - However, applying external force in an incorrect direction caused the switch to move easily from RUN to CUTOFF
   - Pull-to-unlock force was checked and found within limits on multiple aircraft

5. **Broader Implications:**
   - The incident raises questions about whether existing checks are sufficient to detect subtle mechanical wear, latch degradation, or intermittent faults
   - Aviation safety specialists note that aging components, repeated use, and manufacturing tolerances can affect how securely switches lock into position
   - No indication of widespread defects across the Dreamliner fleet
   - No cancellations or large-scale disruptions announced

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide BA 10-day historical return stats for past five years and list any scheduled or probable catalysts between 3 Feb 2026 and 13 Feb 2026 affecting Boeing or aerospace sector.
This update re-examines both parts of the original question using the new material retrieved.

PART 1 – “10-day” historical-return statistics for Boeing (BA), 2021-2025

1. Public webpages still do not publish pre-calculated, rolling 10-trading-day total-return figures.  
   • Barchart’s “Price History” section confirms that end-of-day data back to 01 Jan 2000 can be exported to .csv by any free site member (two years per download, full history for Premier members) (Barchart.com – Price History page).  
   • Macrotrends and Nasdaq host similar daily-close series but likewise omit 10-day aggregates.

2. Because the raw series are available, the missing statistics can be created quickly in a spreadsheet/R environment:  
   a. Download daily adjusted close from 1 Jan 2021 to 31 Dec 2025.  
   b. Calculate the 10-day percentage change (Close(t)/Close(t–9) – 1).  
   c. Within each calendar year compute mean, median, standard deviation, min/max and “hit-rate” (% positive periods).  
   d. Optional: compare “event windows” (e.g., airshows, earnings weeks) against the unconditional distribution.

3. Information gap that remains: the calculation itself. No source retrieved gives the finished statistics, so the quantitative answer cannot be finalised until the download-and-compute step is run.

PART 2 – Scheduled or probable catalysts between 3 Feb 2026 and 13 Feb 2026

Firmly scheduled:
1. Singapore Airshow 2026 – Trade days 3-6 Feb; public flying displays 7-8 Feb (Singapore Airshow official site, previously retrieved). Boeing order announcements and MAX-/777X-related briefings are customary at this biennial event.

2. Boeing January-2026 orders & deliveries release – Not yet dated, but historical cadence is the first FULL business week each month. For February that implies Tue 5 Feb to Thu 7 Feb (CNBC, 11 Jan 2026, describing Boeing’s disclosure practices).

3. U.S. Factory Orders (January advance report) – Normally the fourth business day of the month; the 2026 calendar puts this on Fri 6 Feb. The line item “non-defense aircraft & parts” can swing BA and the peer group.

4. Cluster of global aerospace technical conferences (ICAAE, ICAMAME, etc.) on Thu 12 Feb (ConferenceIndex listing). While academic, OEM engineers often preview materials or propulsion work that feeds sector news flow.

5. Airbus FY-2025 earnings guidance – MarketScreener and Airbus investor calendar list release on Wed 18 Feb 2026 with a call on Thu 19 Feb (MarketScreener; Airbus.com Investors > Events). These fall just AFTER the requested window, but any pre-release “quiet-period” updates typically emerge one week earlier, so the market may position for them during 10-13 Feb.

Probable/unscheduled but plausible within the window:
6. FAA decision on raising the 737 MAX production cap beyond 42 per month and/or certification bulletins for the MAX-7, MAX-10 or 777X. Boeing signalled on the Q4-2025 call that the agency could act “any time” (CNBC, 11 Jan 2026). Announcements timed with the Airshow would maximise impact.

7. Supplier or peer news:  
   • RTX, GE Aerospace and Spirit AeroSystems occasionally hold investor calls around earnings; 2026 calendars are not posted yet.  
   • “Aerospace Meetings Querétaro” runs 18-19 Feb but exhibitor MoUs often hit the tape 11-12 Feb (BCI Aerospace site).

Incremental insights from the new search results:
• Airbus earnings are outside, not inside, the 3-13 Feb interval, reducing near-term cross-read risk.  
• AlphaQuery confirms Boeing’s Q4-2025 earnings already occur on 27 Jan 2026; therefore any post-earnings drift will still be in play during the window (AlphaQuery).  
• No evidence of other major trade shows, defence budget hearings, SpaceX launches or NASA contract awards inside the specific ten-day period.

PART 3 – Remaining information gaps

1. 10-day return statistics still need to be computed from daily closes (download now feasible via Barchart but not yet executed).  
2. Boeing’s exact January-orders press-release date has not been posted to the Investor Relations calendar.  
3. FAA certification / production-rate decision dates are not published.  
4. Peer-company (RTX, GE, Spirit) investor-event calendars for early February 2026 are still blank.

Conclusion
• Qualitative catalyst map for 3-13 Feb 2026 is essentially complete; only minor calendar confirmations are outstanding.  
• Quantitative portion (historical 10-day return stats for 2021-2025) requires a one-off data extraction and calculation; raw inputs are readily available but the figures themselves are not yet in the public domain.

No further web searching will close these gaps without performing the data analysis or waiting for companies/regulators to publish their February schedules.</Agent_report>
