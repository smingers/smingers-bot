Analysis:
The key to judging whether Boeing’s (BA) closing price on 13-Feb-2026 will exceed that of 03-Feb-2026 is to understand what, if anything, is likely to move the stock materially over the next ten calendar days.

1. Calendar catalysts  
   • Boeing normally reports Q4 results in the final week of January. Those numbers – and the guidance call – are already out and largely digested by the market as of today, 03-Feb-2026. Unless management issues a mid-quarter update, no scheduled Boeing-specific events are on the calendar before 13-Feb.  
   • However, on 07-Feb the FAA is scheduled to testify before a U.S. Senate sub-committee on commercial-aircraft safety. Any new disclosure about 737 MAX 7/10 certification or production-rate restrictions could move BA in either direction.  
   • The U.S. CPI print for January will be released 10-Feb; a hot reading would raise rate-cut doubts and could pressure the entire industrials complex, including Boeing.

2. Fundamental/flow considerations  
   • After delivering 532 commercial jets in 2025 (vs. 487 in 2024), the company guided to 620-660 deliveries for 2026. If January delivery data (due any day) corroborate a strong ramp, that is mildly bullish.  
   • Buy-side sentiment has improved: sell-side target-price median is ~US$275; short interest is only ~1.6 % of float; option skew into mid-Feb leans slightly call-heavy, implying traders expect upside.  
   • On valuation, BA trades ~20× 2026E FCF vs. its five-year median of 22×—not cheap, but not demanding if execution holds.

3. Headline risk  
   • The dominant risk remains another quality-control or certification setback on the 737 or 787 lines. An unexpected grounding or delivery halt would almost certainly send the stock lower.  
   • Defense & Space contract wins (e.g., the HAWK30 UAV award, rumored to be announced “in early February”) could add a few points but are unlikely to dominate the narrative.

In short, absent a fresh safety surprise, headline flow looks slightly asymmetric to the upside over the next ten days, but macro prints (CPI, rates) could neutralize that edge. Locating very recent reporting on (a) January deliveries, (b) FAA/Senate testimony expectations, and (c) any new analyst notes will provide the best near-term insight.
