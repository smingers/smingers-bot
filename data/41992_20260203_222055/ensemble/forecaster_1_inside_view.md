## (a) Source Analysis

**Summary Articles (Pre-provided context):**

1. **Nuclear Security Helicopter Flights (Local News Matters, Feb 2, 2026):** FACTUAL - NNSA conducting low-altitude helicopter flights Monday-Wednesday (Feb 3-5) over Bay Area for Super Bowl radiation sensing. High quality, timely source.

2. **FAA Super Bowl Restrictions (Feb 4-10, 2026):** FACTUAL - TFR anticipated Feb 8, 2026 in SF Bay Area. Official government source, highly reliable.

3. **CBS News Bay Area Helicopter Flights (Feb 2, 2026):** FACTUAL - Confirms same NNSA helicopter story through Wednesday Feb 4. Corroborates Source 1.

4. **ABC News 2025 Aviation Recap:** FACTUAL - Multiple helicopter crashes in 2025 including Reagan National (67 deaths, Jan 2025), Philadelphia (7 deaths), Hudson River tourist crash. Historical context, not directly predictive for Feb 3-14 window.

5. **Superior AZ Helicopter Crash (AZFamily, Jan 4, 2026):** FACTUAL - 4 deaths from slackline collision Jan 2, 2026. NTSB preliminary report expected within 30 days (early February). Expert Tim Kiefer's opinion on outdated NOTAM system is credible but not directly relevant to search trends.

6. **Marine Helicopter Crash (LA Times, Oct 18, 2025):** FACTUAL but OLD - October 2025 incident, too distant to impact Feb 3-14 window.

**AskNews Articles:**

1. **TransDigm Revenue Report (Feb 3, 2026):** Business/finance news mentioning helicopters as product category. WEAK relevance - unlikely to drive consumer searches.

2. **Air Crane Helicopter Market Reports (Feb 3, Feb 2, 2026):** Industry/market research. WEAK relevance - B2B content, not consumer search drivers.

3. **Russian Mi-34M1 Helicopter Unveiling (Feb 2-3, 2026):** Aviation industry news. WEAK relevance - specialized audience, geographically limited.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE:**

1. **NNSA Helicopter Flights Feb 3-5 (Multiple independent sources - Local News Matters, CBS News, Feb 2, 2026):** These low-altitude flights over populated Bay Area during EXACTLY the baseline measurement period (Feb 3) could drive localized search interest. However, the public notification is designed to PREVENT alarm, which may limit search spikes. The flights END by Feb 5, so any interest boost would decay by Feb 14.

2. **Super Bowl LX on Feb 8, 2026 (FAA official source):** Major event mid-window. However, "helicopter" searches related to Super Bowl are likely limited to: (a) security/news coverage, (b) wealthy attendees booking charters. The FAA restrictions actually LIMIT helicopter operations, potentially reducing charter interest. MODERATE impact, localized.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**

3. **Leeds Helicopter Crash (Feb 2, 2026 - FOX 13, St. George News):** Critical injury crash one day before baseline. However, this is a SMALL local story (85-year-old pilot, non-fatal for passenger, local Utah news). Unlike major disasters, this is unlikely to generate sustained national search interest. By Feb 3, any spike would already be captured in baseline.

4. **Superior AZ Crash NTSB Report Due (early Feb 2026):** The 30-day timeline from Jan 2 crash places preliminary report around Feb 1-2. However, NTSB preliminary reports rarely generate major public interest - they're technical documents. WEAK-MODERATE impact.

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

5. **Valentine's Day (Feb 14):** Helicopter tour searches are niche. Unlikely to significantly impact national trends.

6. **Industry/Market Reports:** Multiple reports about helicopter markets, but these are B2B content consumed by industry professionals, not general public. NO impact on consumer search trends.

7. **Historical 2025 Crashes (Reagan National, etc.):** These are OLD news by Feb 2026. The Dec 19, 2025 "67" trend spike shows crashes can drive interest, but that was 6+ weeks ago and related to government acknowledgment of a major disaster. NOT predictive for Feb 3-14.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window:** 11 days (Feb 3 to Feb 14, 2026)

**Key Temporal Dynamics:**

1. **Feb 3 Baseline Timing:** The baseline is measured on the FIRST DAY of NNSA helicopter flights. If these flights generate search interest, it would be captured in the Feb 3 baseline, creating an elevated starting point.

2. **Decay Pattern:** NNSA flights end Feb 5 (2 days into window). Any interest boost decays over remaining 9 days to Feb 14.

3. **Super Bowl (Feb 8):** Mid-window event, but helicopter-specific interest likely minimal and temporary.

4. **Resolution Date = Valentine's Day:** Feb 14 measurement coincides with Valentine's Day, but this is unlikely to create sustained "helicopter" search interest.

**If Timeframe Halved (5-6 days):** Would increase "Doesn't change" probability - less time for decay from any Feb 3 elevation, more likely to stay within ±3 range.

**If Timeframe Doubled (22 days):** Would increase "Decreases" probability - more time for mean reversion from any event-driven spikes, less likely Valentine's Day effect persists.

## (d) Justification

**Critical Reassessment of Outside View:**

My outside view assumed the Leeds crash would elevate the Feb 3 baseline significantly. However, analyzing source quality reveals:

1. **Leeds crash is LOCAL news** (Utah outlets only), not national
2. **Non-fatal** (critical injury, not deaths)
3. **Small aircraft** (private helicopter, not commercial/military)

This is FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT from the reference class of "major aviation incidents" like Reagan National (67 deaths, national news). The Leeds crash is unlikely to create a significant national Google Trends spike.

**Revised Key Factors:**

1. **NNSA Flights (STRONG, but CONTRADICTORY):** 
   - PRO-INCREASE: Unusual low-altitude flights over populated area during Feb 3-5
   - PRO-DECREASE: Public was pre-notified to prevent alarm; flights end by Feb 5, leaving 9 days for decay
   - NET EFFECT: Likely creates modest Feb 3 elevation that decays by Feb 14

2. **Baseline Volatility (STRONG):**
   - The ±3 threshold is CRITICAL. If "helicopter" typically ranges 30-50 on Google Trends, ±3 represents 6-10% variation
   - Week-to-week noise in Google Trends can easily be ±5-10 points
   - The threshold may capture NORMAL VOLATILITY, making "Doesn't change" more likely than initially assessed

3. **Absence of Major News Drivers (STRONG):**
   - No major helicopter incidents scheduled or predictable
   - Super Bowl and Valentine's Day are weak helicopter search drivers
   - Industry news doesn't affect consumer searches

4. **Mean Reversion Tendency (MODERATE):**
   - 11-day window allows regression toward typical interest levels
   - Absent new major events, trends tend toward baseline

**Shift from Outside View:**

My outside view overweighted the Leeds crash (65% Decrease). Correcting for:
- Leeds crash being local/non-fatal → minimal national impact
- NNSA flights being pre-announced → limited alarm/search interest
- ±3 threshold capturing normal volatility → "Doesn't change" more likely
- Absence of predictable major drivers → status quo more likely

The most probable scenario is that Feb 3 and Feb 14 both represent relatively normal interest levels, with minor fluctuations from NNSA flights, Super Bowl, and Valentine's Day staying within the ±3 buffer.

## Probability Calibration

**Recalibrated Assessment:**

1. **"Doesn't change" (within ±3):** 
   - The ±3 threshold is designed to filter normal noise
   - NNSA flights provide minor boost that decays, but may not exceed threshold
   - No major predictable events to drive large changes
   - **Estimated: 50-55%**

2. **"Decreases" (>3 point drop):**
   - If NNSA flights create modest Feb 3 elevation, decay over 11 days could exceed -3
   - Mean reversion tendency supports this
   - But requires Feb 3 baseline to be elevated enough
   - **Estimated: 30-35%**

3. **"Increases" (>3 point rise):**
   - Would require Feb 14 to have higher interest than Feb 3
   - Possible if: (a) Feb 3 is unusually low, (b) Valentine's Day drives unexpected searches, (c) new helicopter incident occurs, (d) Super Bowl creates sustained interest
   - Least supported by evidence
   - **Estimated: 12-18%**

**Blind Spots:**

1. **Unpredictable news events:** A major helicopter crash Feb 4-14 would invalidate all analysis
2. **Valentine's Day effect underestimated:** If helicopter tours are more popular than assumed
3. **NNSA flights generate more alarm than expected:** Despite pre-notification
4. **Google Trends normalization quirks:** The specific date range and normalization method could create unexpected baseline effects

**Confidence Adjustment:**

Given the ±3 buffer and absence of strong directional drivers, I should be LESS confident in extreme outcomes and MORE confident in "Doesn't change." The evidence supports modest fluctuations that may or may not exceed the threshold.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Google Trends value for "helicopter" on Feb 14 be >3 higher, within ±3, or >3 lower than Feb 3 value?

2. **Base rate:** Outside view was 65% Decrease, 27% No change, 8% Increase. Revised inside view significantly increases "No change" due to evidence showing weaker drivers than assumed.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = "Doesn't change" (normal volatility within buffer); Least likely = "Increases" (requires unexpected positive drivers). This aligns with evidence showing no major predictable events.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - NNSA flights Feb 3-5 create minor, temporary interest boost (FACTUAL, multiple sources)
   - ±3 threshold filters normal week-to-week volatility (STRUCTURAL)
   - Leeds crash is local/non-fatal, not national news driver (FACTUAL assessment)
   - No major helicopter incidents or events Feb 3-14 (ABSENCE of evidence)
   - Super Bowl/Valentine's Day weak helicopter search drivers (LOGICAL inference)

5. **Blind spot:** Major helicopter crash Feb 4-14 would spike interest, making "Increases" or "Decreases" likely depending on timing. Probability ~5-10% based on base rate of major aviation incidents.

6. **Technicalities:** Verified probabilities sum to 100, no % signs.
