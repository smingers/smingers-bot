**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Google Trends for "helicopter" during major aviation incidents:** 
   - Suitability: HIGH - The Leeds crash on Feb 2 is extremely recent and may still be generating news coverage
   - Pattern: Major crashes typically cause 1-3 day spikes in search interest, then rapid decay

2. **Google Trends for "helicopter" during major sporting events (Super Bowl, NASCAR):**
   - Suitability: MODERATE - Events do generate helicopter charter interest, but unclear if this translates to Google searches
   - Pattern: Interest tends to be localized and may not register nationally

3. **Google Trends for "helicopter" during Valentine's Day:**
   - Suitability: LOW-MODERATE - Valentine helicopter tours exist but are niche experiences
   - Pattern: Likely minimal national impact on search trends

4. **Baseline Google Trends volatility for "helicopter":**
   - Suitability: HIGH - Understanding normal week-to-week variation is crucial
   - Pattern: Need to assess if ±3 points represents normal noise or significant change

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** Combination of (1) recent aviation incident decay patterns and (4) baseline volatility, since we have a crash literally one day before the measurement period begins.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

- **Prediction Window:** 11 days (Feb 3 to Feb 14, 2026)
- **Baseline Date:** February 3, 2026 (today)
- **Resolution Date:** February 14, 2026

**Key Temporal Factors:**

1. **Leeds crash (Feb 2) recency effect:** Search interest from a crash typically peaks within 24-48 hours, then decays exponentially. By Feb 3, we may already be at or near peak interest. By Feb 14 (12 days later), interest would normally have substantially declined.

2. **NTSB report timing:** The Arizona slackline crash report was due "in 30 days" from early January, placing it around early February - potentially generating renewed interest.

3. **Super Bowl (Feb 8):** Mid-window, could provide temporary boost but unlikely to dominate "helicopter" searches nationally.

4. **Valentine's Day (Feb 14):** Coincides with resolution date, but romantic helicopter tours are niche.

**Historical Pattern Assessment:**
- Aviation incidents cause sharp but brief spikes
- The Feb 3 baseline will likely capture elevated interest from the Feb 2 crash
- By Feb 14, absent new incidents, interest should decline toward baseline

**(d) Justification:**

The critical insight is **timing relative to the Leeds crash**. February 3 (our baseline measurement) is just ONE DAY after a helicopter crash that critically injured an 85-year-old pilot. This crash will almost certainly have elevated Google search interest by Feb 3.

**Factors favoring DECREASE:**
- Natural decay from crash-related search spike (strongest factor)
- 11-day window allows substantial regression to mean
- No other major helicopter incidents reported in the forecast period
- Super Bowl and Valentine's Day unlikely to generate sustained national "helicopter" search interest

**Factors favoring INCREASE:**
- Potential NTSB report release for Arizona crash
- Super Bowl week could add marginal interest (Feb 8)
- Valentine's Day helicopter tour searches (Feb 14)
- Another helicopter incident could occur (but this is speculative)

**Factors favoring NO CHANGE:**
- If Feb 3 baseline is already elevated and Feb 14 captures Valentine's Day boost, they might offset
- If Google Trends values are already normalized and the ±3 threshold captures normal volatility

**Most Likely Scenario:** The Feb 3 baseline will be elevated due to the Feb 2 Leeds crash. Over 11 days, this elevated interest will decay as the news cycle moves on. Super Bowl and Valentine's Day provide minor countervailing forces but are unlikely to fully offset the decay. The question is whether the net change exceeds the ±3 threshold.

Outside view calibration:

**(a) True Probability Assessment:**
I must avoid overconfidence. The ±3 threshold is crucial - it may represent ~10-15% of typical Google Trends values (which range 0-100 but often sit in 20-60 range for specific terms). This is not an insignificant buffer.

**(b) Previously Established Distributions:**
Google Trends data for specific terms typically shows:
- High day-to-day volatility (±5-10 points is common)
- Mean reversion over 1-2 week periods
- Event-driven spikes that decay exponentially

**(c) Probability Calibration:**
- 90% confidence means I'd be wrong only 1 in 10 times
- Given the Feb 2 crash timing, I have strong directional conviction toward decrease
- But the ±3 buffer and potential countervailing events create uncertainty

**(d) Base Rate of Upsets:**
In Google Trends forecasting:
- News-driven spikes are predictable but timing of new events is not
- The ±3 threshold provides cushion against minor fluctuations
- Major upsets typically require unexpected major news events

**Calibration Logic:**
- **DECREASE probability:** The Feb 2 crash creates a strong prior for elevated Feb 3 baseline with subsequent decay. I estimate 60-70% chance the decrease exceeds -3 points.
- **NO CHANGE probability:** The ±3 buffer is meaningful. If decay is gradual or Valentine's Day provides offset, we might stay within range. I estimate 25-30% chance.
- **INCREASE probability:** Would require either the Feb 3 baseline to be surprisingly low (crash news hadn't propagated) OR significant new positive drivers. I estimate 5-10% chance.

Outside View Prediction:

Increases: 8%
Doesn't change: 27%
Decreases: 65%
