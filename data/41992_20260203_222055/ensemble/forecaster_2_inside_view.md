Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Local News Matters (Feb 2, 2026):** Factual report on NNSA helicopter flights over Bay Area for Super Bowl LX radiation monitoring, Monday-Wednesday (Feb 3-5). High-quality local news source, timely, describes specific helicopter activity during our forecast window. No expert opinion, purely factual event coverage.

**FAA Super Bowl page:** Official government source detailing flight restrictions Feb 4-10, 2026, centered on Feb 8 (game day). Factual regulatory information; mentions helicopters indirectly through general aviation restrictions. High reliability, directly relevant timeframe.

**CBS San Francisco (Feb 2, 2026):** Duplicate coverage of NNSA helicopter story; confirms same facts as Local News Matters. Reliable mainstream media source.

**ABC News year-end recap (2025):** Comprehensive review of 2025 aviation incidents including multiple helicopter crashes (Reagan National collision killing 67, Philadelphia medical helicopter crash killing 7, Hudson River tourist crash, Marine training crash). High-quality journalism with named sources (NTSB chair Jennifer Homendy). Historical context but all events pre-date our forecast window.

**AZFamily.com (Jan 4, 2026):** Factual report on Superior, AZ helicopter crash (4 deaths) caused by slackline collision. Expert opinion from Tim Kiefer (Embry-Riddle professor) criticizing outdated NOTAM system. FAA confirms system upgrade coming in February 2026. Recent but one month before forecast window.

**LA Times (Oct 18, 2025):** Marine helicopter crash report from October 2025. Reliable source but 4+ months old, limited relevance.

**AskNews Articles (Feb 2-3, 2026):** Multiple industry reports on helicopter markets (TransDigm earnings, air crane market forecasts, Russian Mi-34M1 unveiling at NAIS 2026 Feb 4-5, Turkey's KAAN/GÖKBEY exports). These are factual business/industry news but focus on commercial markets, not events likely to drive consumer search interest. The NAIS 2026 exhibition (Feb 4-5 in Moscow) is industry-focused, unlikely to generate broad U.S. public searches.

**Google Trends article (Dec 19, 2025):** Reports "67" trending due to renewed attention to Reagan National helicopter collision. Shows historical example of crash-related search spikes but occurred 6+ weeks before our window.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- Super Bowl LX security helicopter flights (Feb 3-5): Multiple independent sources (Local News, CBS, FAA) confirm low-altitude NNSA helicopter operations in Bay Area during first 3 days of forecast window. This is direct, contemporaneous helicopter activity with public announcements designed to raise awareness. However, these are localized to Bay Area and scheduled/announced events tend to generate less spontaneous search interest than breaking news.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Super Bowl LX itself (Feb 8, 2026): Major national event with associated flight restrictions and security operations. Historically, major sporting events don't typically drive "helicopter" searches unless an incident occurs. The FAA restrictions apply broadly to aviation but aren't helicopter-specific.
- Historical pattern of crash-driven spikes: The ABC News recap and Google Trends example show helicopter crashes can drive significant search interest (the "67" spike). However, crashes are unpredictable and we have no evidence of crashes occurring during Feb 3-14.

**Weak Evidence:**
- Industry events (NAIS 2026, market reports): The Russian helicopter exhibition and various market forecasts are industry-insider events unlikely to penetrate general public consciousness or drive U.S. Google searches.
- NOTAM system upgrade: FAA confirmed February 2026 upgrade timing, but this is technical aviation infrastructure unlikely to generate consumer search interest.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 11 days (Feb 3 → Feb 14, 2026)

The forecast opened Feb 3, resolves Feb 14. We're comparing the Google Trends value on Feb 14 vs Feb 3 within a 30-day window (Jan 15 - Feb 14).

**If timeframe halved (5-6 days):** Would increase "Doesn't change" probability significantly (perhaps to 65-70%) as shorter windows reduce cumulative probability of newsworthy events and allow less time for trends to develop.

**If timeframe doubled (22 days):** Would increase probability of change (perhaps 50-55% combined for Increases/Decreases) as more time allows greater chance of random spikes, news events, or viral content.

## (d) Justification

**Key factors shifting from outside view:**

1. **Super Bowl security helicopters (Feb 3-5):** This is confirmed, contemporaneous helicopter activity with public awareness campaigns. However, it's geographically limited (Bay Area) and pre-announced, reducing viral potential. The activity ends by Feb 5, leaving 9 days for the index to stabilize or move in other directions.

2. **Super Bowl LX (Feb 8):** While a major event, there's no specific evidence of helicopter-related content planned. Past Super Bowls don't systematically drive "helicopter" searches unless incidents occur.

3. **Absence of breaking news:** Most importantly, we have NO evidence of helicopter crashes, incidents, or viral content during Feb 3-14. The historical pattern shows crashes drive major spikes, but crashes are unpredictable and we can't forecast them.

4. **Valentine's Day (Feb 14):** End date coincides with Valentine's Day; no obvious connection to helicopter searches.

5. **Baseline volatility:** The term "helicopter" shows typical mid-frequency noun volatility. February lacks seasonal drivers for this term.

**Direction of adjustment:**

The Super Bowl security flights provide modest upward pressure for the first 2-3 days of the window, potentially raising the Feb 3 baseline slightly. However:
- The effect is likely localized (Bay Area searches)
- The announcement was made Feb 2, so some search interest may have already occurred before Feb 3
- By Feb 14, this effect will have dissipated unless sustained by other news

The most likely scenario is that Feb 3 sees modestly elevated searches due to the security flights announcement/execution, then values normalize. This would create a slight downward bias (Feb 14 < Feb 3) rather than an increase.

However, the magnitude is uncertain and could easily fall within the ±3 point "no change" band. The absence of any evidence for major events during Feb 4-14 that would drive sustained interest suggests reversion to baseline is more likely than continued elevation.

**Shift magnitude:** The Super Bowl helicopter activity is real but localized and temporary. It warrants a modest 5-8 percentage point shift from the base symmetric distribution toward "Decreases" (as Feb 3 may be elevated) and away from "Increases", while keeping "Doesn't change" as modal outcome.

## Probability Calibration

**Base rates:** Increases 24%, Doesn't change 52%, Decreases 24%

**Adjustments:**
- The Super Bowl security helicopter flights create a specific, confirmed event that may elevate Feb 3 searches modestly, then dissipate
- This suggests Feb 14 is more likely to be lower than Feb 3 (as Feb 3 captures peak security flight awareness)
- However, the effect size is uncertain and may fall within ±3 points
- No evidence of events during Feb 4-14 that would sustain or increase interest

**Calibrated probabilities:**
- Increases: 18% (reduced from 24% as early-window elevation makes sustained increase unlikely)
- Doesn't change: 54% (slight increase as most scenarios result in values within ±3)
- Decreases: 28% (increased from 24% as Feb 3 elevation followed by normalization is plausible)

**Confidence check:** The 28% for "Decreases" represents roughly 3.6:1 odds against, which feels appropriate given we have confirmed helicopter activity early in the window but uncertainty about magnitude. The 54% for "Doesn't change" reflects that even with early elevation, the effect may be too small to exceed the ±3 threshold, or may be balanced by other random factors.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Compare Google Trends "helicopter" value Feb 14 vs Feb 3 (in Jan 15-Feb 14 window); resolves "Increases" if >3 higher, "Decreases" if >3 lower, else "Doesn't change"

2. **Base rate:** Started with 24/52/24 split (symmetric, 42% change rate from reference class)

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = "Doesn't change" (54%); Least likely = "Increases" (18%); makes sense given early-window helicopter activity likely creating temporary elevation

4. **Key evidence:**
   - NNSA helicopter flights Bay Area Feb 3-5 (confirmed, multiple sources)
   - Super Bowl LX Feb 8 with associated aviation activity (confirmed)
   - No evidence of crashes or viral content during window (absence of evidence)
   - Historical pattern: crashes drive spikes, but unpredictable (pattern recognition)
   - Feb 3 baseline may be elevated from announcement effect (logical inference)

5. **Blind spot:** Unpredictable helicopter crash or viral helicopter-related content during Feb 4-14 would make forecast look silly. If major incident occurs, "Increases" could spike to 60-80%. This uncertainty justifies keeping "Increases" at 18% rather than lower.

6. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs, all between 0-100.

Probabilities: [18, 54, 28]
