Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:

**Technavio Market Report (2024-2029 forecast):**
- Industry research projecting long-term helicopter market growth (6.3% CAGR)
- Credible source for industry trends but entirely irrelevant to short-term Google search interest
- No bearing on Feb 3-14, 2026 search behavior

**Google Trends "Trending Now" page:**
- Extraction failed; contains only UI elements without substantive data
- Cannot be used for analysis

**FOX 13 News Utah (Feb 2, 2026):**
- LOCAL news report of helicopter crash in Leeds, Utah on Feb 2, 2026
- Pilot critically injured (85-year-old man), woman also aboard
- This is a PAST event (occurred Feb 2, today is Feb 3)
- Regional story, unlikely to drive national search interest significantly
- Quality: Legitimate local news source with specific details

**BBC Article (Jan 7, 2026):**
- Reports Arizona helicopter crash from Jan 2, 2026 (killed 4 family members)
- Involved slackline collision controversy
- This occurred over a month before our prediction window
- While tragic, temporal distance reduces relevance to Feb 3-14 search patterns

**St. George News (Feb 2, 2026):**
- Same Leeds, Utah crash as FOX 13 report
- Content extraction incomplete but corroborates the Feb 2 incident

**Agent Report on Feb 3-14 Helicopter Interest Drivers:**
This report identifies several potential interest drivers:
- **Super Bowl LX (Feb 8, 2026)** at Levi's Stadium, Santa Clara - major event with helicopter charter demand
- **Daytona 500 (Feb 11-15, 2026)** - NASCAR event with helicopter traffic
- **Valentine's Day (Feb 14, 2026)** - experiential gift demand for helicopter rides
- **DC airspace regulations** (formalized Jan 23, 2026) - ongoing regulatory story

The agent report mixes factual event dates with speculative demand projections. Key facts to extract:
- Super Bowl LX is Feb 8 (verifiable major event)
- Daytona 500 is Feb 11-15 (verifiable major event)
- Valentine's Day is Feb 14 (calendar fact)
- DC regulations are recent (Jan 23) and ongoing

However, the agent's conclusions about how these translate to Google search interest are speculative opinions, not established facts.

(b) Reference Class Analysis:

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **Day-to-day Google Trends volatility for "helicopter"** - Most suitable. The search term "helicopter" is a common noun with steady baseline interest driven by news events, accidents, tourism, and general queries.

2. **Event-driven search spikes** - Relevant but uncertain. Major events (Super Bowl, Daytona 500) occur during the window, but whether they drive "helicopter" searches specifically is unclear.

3. **Accident-driven search spikes** - The Feb 2 Utah crash is recent but regional and not catastrophic enough to likely drive sustained national interest through Feb 14.

**Most suitable reference class:** General day-to-day volatility of the term "helicopter" in Google Trends, with consideration for event-driven perturbations.

(c) Timeframe Analysis:

**Prediction window:** 11 days (Feb 3 to Feb 14, 2026)
**Comparison points:** Feb 3 vs Feb 14 values (must differ by >3 points to register as change)

**Key temporal factors:**
- The measurement compares a single data point on Feb 3 against Feb 14
- Google Trends values are normalized (0-100 scale) and can fluctuate based on relative search volume
- An 11-day window is relatively short; "helicopter" is not a trending topic with rapid viral growth patterns
- The threshold of ±3 points creates a "no change" zone, suggesting Google Trends values for this term typically show modest day-to-day variation

**Historical patterns consideration:**
- Generic search terms like "helicopter" typically show:
  - Baseline stability with occasional news-driven spikes
  - Spikes are usually tied to major accidents, military incidents, or viral events
  - The Feb 2 Utah crash is recent but not nationally catastrophic (1 critical injury vs 4 deaths in Arizona crash a month prior)
  - Major sporting events (Super Bowl, Daytona) may generate some helicopter-related searches but "helicopter" itself is not the primary search term for these events

(d) Justification:

**Baseline expectation:** The search term "helicopter" likely maintains relatively stable interest day-to-day, with the ±3 point threshold specifically designed to capture "no change" as the modal outcome.

**Factors favoring "Doesn't change" (baseline):**
- 11-day window is short for significant trend shifts
- "Helicopter" is a generic term without viral growth characteristics
- The Feb 2 Utah crash is regional and not catastrophic enough for sustained national attention through Feb 14
- While Super Bowl (Feb 8) and Daytona 500 (Feb 11-15) occur in the window, people searching about these events use event-specific terms, not "helicopter"

**Factors favoring "Increases":**
- Super Bowl week (Feb 3-8) could generate some helicopter charter/traffic searches
- Valentine's Day (Feb 14) could drive experiential gift searches
- DC airspace regulation story could maintain background interest
- Recent crash (Feb 2) might sustain elevated interest for a few days

**Factors favoring "Decreases":**
- If Feb 3 value is artificially elevated due to the Feb 2 crash, it could normalize downward by Feb 14
- Post-event normalization after any Feb 3-8 Super Bowl-related spike

**Critical uncertainty:** We don't know the Feb 3 baseline value. If Feb 3 is elevated due to the recent crash, decrease becomes more likely. If Feb 3 is at normal levels, the Super Bowl and Valentine's Day could push Feb 14 higher.

Outside view calibration:

The ±3 point threshold suggests the question designer expects "Doesn't change" to be the most common outcome, as Google Trends data for stable search terms typically shows modest variation. This is consistent with designing a well-calibrated forecasting question.

Historical upset rate: In Google Trends questions, unexpected viral events or major news can cause rapid shifts, but for generic terms like "helicopter," such upsets are relatively rare over 11-day windows unless there's a major disaster.

Given:
- The threshold design favoring stability
- The generic nature of the search term
- The modest news drivers in the window
- Uncertainty about whether Feb 3 is elevated (post-crash) or baseline

I estimate:
- **"Doesn't change"** should have the highest probability (50-60% range)
- **"Increases"** has moderate probability if Super Bowl/Valentine's Day drive searches (25-35% range)
- **"Decreases"** has lower probability, primarily if Feb 3 is crash-elevated (15-25% range)

The key uncertainty is whether the Feb 2 crash elevated Feb 3 values temporarily. Without knowing the actual Feb 3 value, I'll weight toward stability with modest increase probability from the events.

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 32%
Doesn't change: 53%
Decreases: 15%
