Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
- Compare US Google Trends “helicopter” value on 2026-02-14 vs 2026-02-03 (within date range shown). If Feb14 is >3 higher => Increases; >3 lower => Decreases; otherwise Doesn’t change.

2) (a) Source analysis (summary + quality/date)

- Local News Matters (2026-02-02): Reports NNSA low-altitude helicopter radiation-survey flights over Bay Area Mon–Wed ahead of Super Bowl LX. Credible local outlet; specific operational details; likely factual (agency announcement). Relevance: could raise searches early in window, but geographically concentrated.

- CBS News Bay Area (2026-02-02): Similar story on low-flying NNSA helicopter through Wednesday. Credible mainstream local TV news; overlaps with Local News Matters (independent-ish corroboration). Relevance: same as above; suggests public-facing comms intended to prevent alarm, which can still trigger curiosity searches.

- FAA Super Bowl page (Feb 4–10, 2026): Primary-source operational notice about anticipated TFR and aviation restrictions around Super Bowl. Very reliable. Does not mention helicopters explicitly; any helicopter-specific search impact is indirect.

- ABC News recap (published as a 2025 recap; includes major 2025 aviation/helicopter incidents): Credible national outlet, but mostly historical context and not tightly linked to Feb 3–14, 2026. Useful mainly as background that “helicopter” can spike on crashes/investigations.

- AZFamily (2026-01-04): Reports Jan 2026 Arizona helicopter crash and NOTAM/slackline controversy; includes expert quote (Embry‑Riddle professor) and FAA statement about NOTAM system replacement in Feb 2026. Credible local reporting; partially relevant (if NOTAM overhaul becomes national story in Feb), but timing/attention uncertain.

- LA Times (2025-10-18): Older report on Marine helicopter crash. High-quality but too old for this short window; minimal direct relevance.

- AskNews / Investing.com France (2026-02-03): Financial results mentioning “business jets and helicopters.” Reliable for finance, but not the kind of mass-interest driver that shifts generic Google searches.

- AskNews / openPR + GlobeNewswire + ResearchAndMarkets-style items (various dates): Mostly PR/market reports about helicopter markets/drones/simulators/RC helicopters. Low signal for near-term mass Google Trends on the generic query “helicopter.”

- AskNews / Russian & Turkish outlets (2026-02-02/03): NAIS expo in Moscow showcasing Mi-34M1; Turkey defense export items including helicopters. Likely factual, but (a) mostly non-US focus, (b) in other languages, (c) unlikely to move US Google searches for the generic term.

3) (b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution criteria)

Strong evidence
- None that directly indicates Feb14 will be >3 above/below Feb3 nationwide. (We lack a strong, national, helicopter-dominant event scheduled exactly near Feb14.)

Moderate evidence (pushes probabilities modestly)
- Two independent local Bay Area reports (Local News Matters + CBS Bay Area) about conspicuous “low-flying helicopter” activity Feb 2–4 tied to Super Bowl security preparations. Mechanism: residents seeing/hearing helicopter(s) + news coverage => searches for “helicopter/low flying helicopter.” This most plausibly elevates interest around Feb3 (the baseline comparison day), which modestly increases the chance of *Decreases* later via reversion to mean by Feb14.

- Super Bowl LX (Feb 8) aviation restrictions (FAA). Indirect mechanism: heightened public discussion of airspace/security/aircraft could increase general aviation searches, but people usually search “Super Bowl flyover,” “TFR,” “Levi’s Stadium,” etc., not necessarily “helicopter.” Net: slight upward pressure mid-window, uncertain effect on Feb14 point.

Weak evidence (small/no adjustments)
- Market/industry PR articles and non-US defense/aviation expo news: unlikely to drive US mass search for the generic term.
- Older crash coverage (Oct 2025, Jan 2026): can raise background salience but weak link to Feb 14 level.

4) (c) Timeframe analysis
- Horizon: 11 days (from Feb 3 to Feb 14).
- If halved (~5–6 days): “Doesn’t change” would become more likely (less time for shocks; fewer weekends/events).
- If doubled (~22 days): “Increases” and “Decreases” both become more likely (more chance of a crash/viral incident, weather/disaster deployment, or event-driven spikes), reducing “Doesn’t change.”

5) (d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside view)
Outside view base rates: Increases 32 / Doesn’t change 53 / Decreases 15.

Key update: the most salient *near-term, public-facing* helicopter story (Bay Area low-altitude NNSA flights) occurs right at the start of the window and overlaps Feb3. That asymmetry matters because the resolution compares a single point on Feb3 to a single point on Feb14. If Feb3 is mildly elevated by this news/experience, and if no equally salient helicopter story is present on Feb14, the distribution shifts toward *Decreases* (mean reversion) and slightly away from *Increases*. However, because it’s geographically concentrated and the term is generic, I don’t think it warrants a large shift; “Doesn’t change” remains modal given the ±3 band.

Blind spots: a major helicopter crash, celebrity incident, or viral “helicopter” video between Feb 10–14 could cause a sharp spike on/near Feb14, flipping outcome to Increases. This is the main reason not to over-weight the “Decreases” reversion story.

Probability calibration
- Small shift from Increases → Decreases relative to outside view, keeping “Doesn’t change” near the low-50s.
- Final inside-view: Increases 27 / Doesn’t change 51 / Decreases 22.

Checklist:
1) Criteria: Feb14 vs Feb3; >+3=Increase, within ±3=No change, <-3=Decrease (US Trends link window).
2) Outside view: [32, 53, 15].
3) Consistency: Most likely = Doesn’t change; least likely = Increases (slightly) — consistent with early-window bump and mean reversion risk.
4) Key evidence: (i) NNSA low-altitude helicopter flights Feb2–4 (two local sources); (ii) Super Bowl Feb8 aviation/security context; (iii) generic term + ±3 band implies stability.
5) Blind spot: major helicopter accident/viral event near Feb14 would raise Increases notably.
6) Technical: probs 0–100 integers summing to 100.

Probabilities: [27, 51, 22]
