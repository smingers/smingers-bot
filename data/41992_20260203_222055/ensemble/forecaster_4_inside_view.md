Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological order, most relevant first)

1. Local News Matters & CBS News, 2 Feb 2026 – Both report NNSA low-altitude helicopter survey flights 3-4 Feb over the San-Francisco Bay Area for Super Bowl LX security.  Factual, local outlets quoting official agencies; reliable, time-relevant.

2. FAA Super Bowl web-page – 4-10 Feb temporary flight restrictions.  Primary-source rules site, high quality; indirect evidence (mentions aircraft, not helicopters specifically).

3. AskNews batch of 3 Russian-language stories (Rostec Mi-34M1) – Trade-show news, 4-5 Feb in Moscow.  Factual but mainly domestic Russian interest; historically such stories do not move U.S. Google Trends aggregate.  Low U.S. relevance.

4. TransDigm earnings, Airbus short-interest, multiple “market reports” (air-crane, helicopter drones, simulators, etc.).  Investor/PR items, factual numbers but typically produce negligible general-public search volume.

5. AZFamily 4 Jan 2026 Superior AZ fatal crash (FAA/NTSB).  Factual and reliable; however, the incident is four weeks old—any search spike almost certainly decayed by now.

(b) Evidence weighting toward 3-14 Feb U.S. Google-Trends value

Strong evidence – none.

Moderate evidence – NNSA Bay-Area helicopter flights (national wires picked up story; coincides exactly with 3-4 Feb, likely to lift 3 Feb baseline a few points); Super Bowl itself (8 Feb) may generate fresh helicopter-security coverage and “blimp/helicopter shots” stories but those would peak 8-9 Feb, then fade.

Weak evidence – Russian exhibition, equity/market press-releases, dated crash in AZ, Valentine’s-Day “helicopter ride” advertising.  Possible, but historically small signals.

Net directional pull:
• 3 Feb value slightly ELEVATED by day-one media coverage.  
• 14 Feb (Saturday, Valentine’s Day, post-game quiet) likely closer to ordinary weekend baseline or a touch higher for leisure searches, but lower than 3 Feb if the early spike is short-lived.  
Hence the available evidence tips modestly toward “Decreases.”

(c) Timeframe analysis
Window = 11 days.  If resolution gap were halved (to 5-6 days) the early-spike effect would dominate even more ⇒ higher Decrease probability.  If doubled (~22 days) noise and new events start to dominate ⇒ “Doesn’t change” regains weight, tails converge.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base (generic, medium-volume noun, ±3 threshold over 11 days):  
Increases 36 | No change 34 | Decreases 30.

Inside-view shifts:
+4 pts to Decreases – early Bay-Area media bump artificially lifts start-day.  
–4 pts split between Increases/No-change – lack of credible forward drivers; weekend/Valentine uplift only partly offsets.

Blind-spot: national helicopter crash or viral clip 12-13 Feb could spike searches and flip outcome to Increase; probability judged ~10%, included in tail.

Probability calibration (rounded integers, sum = 100)
Increases 32  
Doesn’t change 31  
Decreases 37  

Checklist (abridged)
1. Options: ≥4-point rise = Increase; within ±3 = No change; ≤-4 = Decrease, comparing 3 Feb vs 14 Feb US Google-Trends.  
2. Base: 36/34/30.  
3. Consistency: Most-likely = Decrease; least-likely = No change? actually Increases slightly less than No-change? Re-check – chosen distribution passes sanity.  
4. Key evidence: (i) NNSA flights 3-4 Feb; (ii) Super Bowl security chatter 8-9 Feb; (iii) Weekend/Valentine’s day pattern; (iv) typical ±3 variance over 11 days.  
5. Blind-spot: fresh major crash or viral “helicopter rescue” 12-14 Feb.  
6. Numbers 0-100, sum 100.

Probabilities: [32, 31, 37]
