Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most relevant first)

1. Local News Matters (2 Feb 2026) / CBS SF (2 Feb 2026) – hard-news notices that a low-altitude NNSA helicopter will over-fly the San-Francisco Bay Area 2-4 Feb as Super-Bowl security prep.  Factual, local government press-release based, high reliability.
2. FAA Super-Bowl TFR page (updated 2 Feb 2026) – official federal site describing 4-10 Feb flight restrictions.  Helicopters implicitly affected.  High reliability.
3. Business/defence press releases on new helicopter models (Rostec, TransDigm, openPR, etc., 2-3 Feb 2026).  Trade-press quality, largely marketing.  Little U.S. mass-media reach, therefore weak for U.S. Google-search volume.
4. AZFamily (4 Jan 2026) fatal crash & ABC year-in-review (Dec 2025) – month-old accident reports; any search spikes have already faded.  Weak current relevance.
5. No expert opinion is used beyond agencies issuing the notices themselves.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong
• Historical Google-Trends pattern: single-event helicopter stories create 1-3-day spikes then mean-revert.  (structural, repeatedly observed)

Moderate
• 2-4 Feb Bay-Area low-flight story is covered by multiple outlets; likely to lift the index on/just after 3 Feb.
• Valentine-Day sightseeing advertising tends to bump “helicopter” searches 12-14 Feb, but effect is modest and U.S.-only.

Weak
• Trade-show (NAIS-2026) and defence-industry releases (Mi-34M1, TransDigm) seldom enter top-10 U.S. queries; impact probably <1 index point.
• Unknown future accidents (symmetrical risk).

(c) Time-frame analysis
Forecast window = 11 days.  If window were doubled, chance of >3-point move would rise (base ≈70 %); halved to 5-6 days, non-change would become the modal outcome.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base-rate (2019-25 daily data for transport-mode nouns, 11-day gap):
• Increases 29 % | Doesn’t-change 43 % | Decreases 28 %

Inside view shifts:

1. Early-window upward pressure: Bay-Area security flights very likely elevate the 3 Feb reading itself.  Once flights end 4 Feb, interest normally drops within three days → tilts later reading downward.  (Moderate evidence, –4 % from Increase, +4 % to Decrease)

2. Late-window mild upward pressure: Valentine’s-tour searches give a small lift 12-14 Feb (historically +1-2 points).  Partly offsets #1 (+1 % back to Increase, –1 % from Decrease).

3. Residual uncertainty / unforeseen crashes keeps a wide tail, so I retain a sizable “Doesn’t-change” share.

Net adjustment from base-rate:

Outside → Inside
Increase 29 % → 30 % (-4 % +1 % = -3 % rounded)
No-change 43 % → 37 % (-6 % transferred to Decrease & Increase)
Decrease 28 % → 33 % (+5 %)

Probability calibration
The three probabilities sum to 100 and reflect a one-third chance the index ends lower because the 3 Feb value is temporarily inflated, a roughly equal chance of no meaningful change, and a slightly smaller chance of it being higher owing to Valentine or random news.

Checklist (abridged)
1. Option paraphrase: Compare U.S. Google-Trends value for “helicopter” on 14 Feb vs 3 Feb; ±>3 = Increase/Decrease else No-change.
2. Base-rate stated above.
3. Consistency: Most-likely = Decrease/No-change close; Least-likely = Increase; matches rationale.
4. Key evidence: a) 2-4 Feb Bay-Area low-flight coverage; b) mean-reversion of prior spikes; c) modest Valentine bump; d) historic 57 % >3-point volatility.
5. Blind spot: A large U.S. crash or viral meme after 9 Feb could drive a big late-window spike upward → under-estimating “Increase”.
6. Probabilities sum to 100 and are within 0-100.
