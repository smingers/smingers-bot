    "description": "Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the \u201cinterest over time\u201d graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated\u2014for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.\n\nThe current value of the topic \u201chelicopter\u201d at the time of writing this question (Feb 1, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 60; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=helicopter&date=2026-01-02%202026-02-01).\n\n`{\"format\":\"trends_interest_change_magnitude\",\"info\":{\"topic\":\"helicopter\",\"trend_start\":\"2026-02-03\",\"trend_end\":\"2026-02-14\",\"verification_url\":\"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=helicopter&date=2026-01-15%202026-02-14\"}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves \u201cDoesn't change\u201d if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=helicopter&date=2026-01-15%202026-02-14](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=helicopter&date=2026-01-15%202026-02-14) for 2026-02-14 is within 3 of the value at 2026-02-03. It resolves \u201cIncreases\u201d if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves \u201cDecreases\u201d if the value is more than 3 lower.",
    "fine_print": "A script will be used to determine the resolution of this question. It will access the data on Google Trends using [SerpApi](https://serpapi.com/), and compare the height of the timeline for the two aforementioned dates. The specific python query will be structured as follows:\n```\nfrom serpapi import GoogleSearch\n\nsearch = GoogleSearch(params={\n  \"api_key\": API_KEY,\n  \"engine\": \"google_trends\",\n  \"data_type\": \"TIMESERIES\",\n  \"geo\": \"US\",\n  \"tz\": 0,\n  \"q\": \"helicopter\",\n  \"date\": \"2026-01-15 2026-02-14\",\n})\nsearch.get_dict()\n```\nNote that there may be minor differences between the results returned by the API and the data appearing on the page. This seems to be due to the 'tz' parameter not having the intended effect in-browser. In this case, the API results will be considered authoritative.\nNote that the precision of the timeline will be 1 day, so this will compare the overall interest for the whole day as determined by Google Trends.\nDates are determined in UTC.\nIf the data is no longer available, or the script fails, this question will be annulled or manually resolved by a moderator.",
