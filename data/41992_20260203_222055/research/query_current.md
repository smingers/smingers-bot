Analysis:
To anticipate whether search interest in “helicopter” will move noticeably in the next 11 days, the most useful signals are:
• High-visibility incidents (e.g., crashes, emergency landings, dramatic rescues).  
• Planned mass-audience events that feature helicopters (Super Bowl LX fly-overs and security flights on 8 Feb 2026, possible NASA Mars helicopter news, military exercises).  
• Commercial or technological announcements (new eVTOL/helicopter models, major contracts, certification milestones).  
Finding any reports of imminent events or scheduled news releases—and checking if fresh accidents have already happened today—will help judge whether public search interest is likely to spike or fall.
