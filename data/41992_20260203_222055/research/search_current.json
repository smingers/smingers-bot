(NYSE:TDG) reported strong first-quarter 2026 results, with revenue rising 13.9% year-over-year to \u20ac2.285 billion, surpassing analyst expectations of \u20ac2.26 billion. Adjusted earnings per share reached \u20ac8.23, exceeding the forecast of \u20ac8.09 and representing a 5.1% increase from the prior year. The company revised its full-year 2026 guidance upward across all key metrics: revenue now projected at \u20ac9.94 billion (up from \u20ac9.85 billion), EBITDA at \u20ac5.21 billion (up from \u20ac5.15 billion), and adjusted EPS at \u20ac38.38 (up from \u20ac37.51). Growth was led by commercial equipment suppliers, up 17% YoY, driven by 18% growth in commercial transport and 15% in business jets and helicopters. Aftermarket commercial revenue rose 7% YoY, with 8% growth in commercial transport aftermarket and only 1% in business jets and helicopters. Defense revenue also increased by 7%, with equipment supplier growth outpacing aftermarket. EBITDA rose 12.8% to \u20ac1.197 billion, though the margin slightly contracted to 52.4% from 52.9%. Gross profit increased to \u20ac1.352 billion, but the margin declined to 59.2% from 61.6%. Selling, general, and administrative expenses rose to 11.1% of revenue from 10.5%. Interest expenses surged 25.7% to \u20ac475 million due to higher debt levels and interest rates. Total debt stood at \u20ac30.25 billion (leverage ratio of 6.2x), with net debt at \u20ac27.73 billion (5.7x) and \u20ac2.53 billion in cash. Approximately 75% of debt is fixed or hedged through 2029. Despite strong cash flow from operations of \u20ac832 million (up from \u20ac752 million), the stock fell 4.84% in pre-market trading to \u20ac1.366, and dropped further to 10.18% at market open, reflecting investor concerns over high leverage, rising interest costs, and margin compression. Analysts cited temporary distributor inventory contraction and cautious outlooks as contributing factors. CEO Mike Lisman emphasized the company's strategic consistency and goal of delivering venture capital-like returns with public market liquidity. Market reaction suggests investors are weighing risks including macroeconomic pressures, integration challenges from recent acquisitions, and the impact of high interest expenses on net income growth. TransDigm\u2019s business model, centered on proprietary products and strong aftermarket presence, continues to generate EBITDA margins above 50% and robust cash flows.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 05:49 PM\nSource:[Investing.com France](https://fr.investing.com/news/company-news/transdigm-t1-2026--chiffre-daffaires-en-hausse-de-14-previsions-revues-a-la-hausse-malgre-la-baisse-du-titre-93CH-3251380)\n\n**Air Crane Helicopter Market With Top Booming Companies At a CAGR of 8.6% by 2032**\nThe global air crane helicopter market generated $4.77 billion in 2022 and is projected to reach $10.79 billion by 2032, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 8.6% from 2023 to 2032. Key drivers include rising demand for aerial firefighting, expansion of construction and infrastructure projects, and increased global energy production. Despite challenges such as strict aviation regulations and high upfront and maintenance costs, growth is supported by technological advancements and increasing adoption in developing regions. North America held the largest market share in 2022, accounting for nearly 40% of revenue, driven by frequent wildfires in California and the Pacific Northwest, and strong investments in disaster preparedness and infrastructure. The Asia-Pacific region is expected to grow at the highest CAGR of 10.1% due to heavy investments in transportation networks, energy facilities, and urban development. Notable advancements include Erickson Incorporated\u2019s delivery of an S-64 Air Crane to Korea Forest Service in December 2022, equipped with a 2,650-gallon tank and rapid snorkel fill system for 24/7 firefighting operations. In the same month, the U.S. Navy approved full-scale production of the CH-53K King Stallion by Sikorsky, a Lockheed Martin subsidiary, which will replace older heavy-lift helicopters. In May 2020, Sikorsky demonstrated autonomous flight capabilities on an optionally piloted UH-60A Black Hawk in collaboration with DARPA, proving safety and reliability comparable to human-piloted missions. Key market players include Airbus SE, Erickson Incorporated, Lockheed Martin Corporation, The Boeing Company, Textron Aviation Inc., and others.
