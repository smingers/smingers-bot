- Manifold: 30% for 2026 (play-money market)

**Critical Finding:**
- Target Metaculus question #41144 is not publicly accessible - we cannot verify current community prediction baseline

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (warranting large shifts):**
1. **SAF leader's explicit ceasefire rejection (Feb 3, 2026)**: Al-Burhan's direct statement "no truce, no ceasefire so long as the RSF occupies cities" is a clear, recent, authoritative rejection from one warring party. This is structural opposition to ceasefire.
   - Direction: Downward pressure on ceasefire probability
   - Impact: Major

2. **Ongoing military operations (Feb 3, 2026)**: Same-day reports of army offensive breaking siege AND RSF drone strikes killing civilians show active escalation, not de-escalation
   - Direction: Downward pressure
   - Impact: Major

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Quadrilateral diplomatic initiative**: Multiple sources confirm US/UAE/Saudi/Egypt coordination, but CFR notes SAF "did not respond" to November 2025 proposal
   - Direction: Slight upward (shows diplomatic effort exists)
   - Impact: Small (offset by lack of response)

2. **Historical pattern of failed ceasefires**: CFR and Brookings note "both sides have history of violating agreements"
   - Direction: Downward
   - Impact: Moderate

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Market consensus around 30-32%**: Suggests crowd wisdom sees roughly 1-in-3 chance for 2026
   - Direction: Baseline anchor
   - Impact: Moderate (but we're predicting the prediction, not the event)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 11 days (Feb 4 to Feb 15, 2026)

The question asks whether Metaculus community prediction will be >31% on Feb 15 for a ceasefire "during 2026" (11-month remaining window).

**If timeframe were halved (5-6 days)**:
- Less time for new information to emerge
- Community predictions would likely stay closer to current baseline
- Prediction would be more dependent on where the baseline currently sits

**If timeframe were doubled (22 days)**:
- More opportunity for diplomatic developments to shift community views
- Higher variance in potential outcomes
- Could see either optimistic updates (if talks progress) or pessimistic updates (if fighting intensifies)

**Key consideration**: The most recent substantive news (Feb 3) shows military escalation and explicit ceasefire rejection. This is **negative information** that would push community predictions downward if forecasters are updating on current events.

## (d) Justification

**Starting point**: Outside view suggested 45% based on market consensus around 30-32% threshold.

**Major updates from current information**:

1. **Al-Burhan's Feb 3 rejection of ceasefire** (-15 percentage points):
   - This is the most recent, authoritative statement from a principal party
   - Explicit, unambiguous rejection of ceasefire while RSF holds territory
   - RSF currently controls significant territory, so this condition unlikely to change rapidly
   - Forecasters updating on this news would likely lower their estimates

2. **Concurrent military escalation** (-10 percentage points):
   - Army offensive and RSF drone strikes on same day (Feb 3)
   - Shows active fighting, not de-escalation
   - Contradicts ceasefire narrative

3. **Failed November 2025 ceasefire proposal** (-5 percentage points):
   - SAF non-response to previous initiative shows pattern of rejection
   - Reduces credibility of current Quadrilateral efforts

4. **Diplomatic activity continues** (+5 percentage points):
   - Hamdok meetings, Quad coordination show ongoing effort
   - Prevents complete collapse of ceasefire hopes
   - But lacks concrete results

**Net adjustment**: -25 percentage points from outside view base of 45% = **20%**

**Critical unknown**: Without access to current Metaculus baseline, there's significant uncertainty. However, if the Metaculus community is updating on the same recent news (Feb 3 ceasefire rejection + military escalation), they would likely be revising downward from wherever they started.

The question becomes: Will the community prediction be above or below 31% after processing this negative news?

Given:
- Recent authoritative ceasefire rejection
- Active military operations
- Historical pattern of failed talks
- Market consensus was already only 30-32% before this news

I assess **25% probability** that the Metaculus community prediction will exceed 31% on Feb 15.

## Probability Calibration

The outside view base rate of 45% was anchored to market predictions clustering around 30-32%. However, this assumed roughly neutral information flow.

The critical new information is:
- **Feb 3, 2026**: SAF leader explicitly rejects ceasefire
- **Feb 3, 2026**: Active military operations continue

This is strongly negative information that would rationally cause forecasters to lower their estimates. If the Metaculus community was at 30-35% before Feb 3, they would likely revise downward to 25-30% after processing this news.

**Calibration check**: 
- At 25%, I'm saying there's a 1-in-4 chance the community prediction exceeds 31%
- This implies I believe the community prediction will most likely be in the 25-30% range
- This seems consistent with: (a) market baseline around 30%, (b) recent negative news, (c) 11 days for community to process information

**Confidence level**: Moderate uncertainty due to inability to verify current Metaculus baseline, but recent authoritative ceasefire rejection provides strong directional signal.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Metaculus community predict >31% chance of Sudan ceasefire during 2026, as measured on Feb 15, 2026? (11 days from now)

2. **Base rate alignment**: Outside view was 45% (markets near threshold). Inside view shifts to 25% due to Feb 3 ceasefire rejection and military escalation.

3. **Consistency**: "25 out of 100 times, the Metaculus community prediction exceeds 31% on Feb 15." This seems reasonable given recent negative news would push most forecasters below the threshold.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Al-Burhan explicitly rejected ceasefire Feb 3 (verified, AFP)
   - Active military operations Feb 3 in Kadugli (verified, AFP/UN)
   - SAF didn't respond to Nov 2025 ceasefire proposal (verified, CFR)
   - Markets show 30-32% baseline (verified, Polymarket/Manifold)

5. **Blind spot**: If there's a major diplomatic breakthrough in next 11 days (surprise ceasefire announcement, high-level talks), community could spike above 31%. Probability of this: ~15%, which is embedded in my 25% forecast.

6. **Status quo**: Recent trajectory is military escalation, not de-escalation. Status quo suggests community predictions would drift downward or stay flat, not upward. This supports prediction <50%.

Probability: 25%
