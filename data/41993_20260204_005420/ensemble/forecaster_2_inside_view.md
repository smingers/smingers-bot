**Critical new information (3 Feb 2026):**

- Continued fighting despite diplomatic efforts

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence (large shifts):**
1. **Al-Burhan's explicit rejection (3 Feb)**: SAF leader categorically rejected ceasefire while RSF occupies cities. This is a direct, recent statement from the primary decision-maker. Combined with immediate resumption of violence (drone strikes), this strongly indicates no near-term ceasefire. **Direction: Sharply downward.**

2. **Pattern of failed negotiations**: Multiple sources (CFR, Brookings, UN) document that numerous ceasefire attempts have failed over 2+ years. The November 2025 Quad proposal received no SAF response. Historical pattern shows both sides violate agreements. **Direction: Downward.**

**Moderate evidence:**
1. **Active diplomatic efforts**: UK UNSC presidency (Feb 19 meeting), Hamdok's European tour, Quad initiative all show sustained international pressure. However, these are process indicators, not outcome indicators. **Direction: Slight upward (process exists) but weak (no traction).**

2. **Military momentum favoring SAF**: Breaking Kadugli siege shows SAF gaining ground, which historically reduces incentive to negotiate. **Direction: Downward.**

**Weak evidence:**
1. **"Year of Peace" rhetoric**: Sudan PM's declaration is aspirational political messaging, not substantive policy. **Direction: Minimal.**

2. **Olympic truce appeal**: No conflict parties responded. **Direction: Minimal.**

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeframe**: 11 days (4 Feb → 15 Feb 2026)

This extremely short window is critical. The question asks whether the Metaculus community prediction will be >31% on Feb 15, not whether a ceasefire will actually occur.

**Key consideration**: Community predictions respond to news flow. Al-Burhan's 3 Feb statement is breaking news that directly addresses ceasefire prospects. This is exactly the type of information that would cause Metaculus forecasters to update downward.

**If timeframe doubled (22 days)**: More time for diplomatic developments (UK UNSC meeting on Feb 19 could produce new proposals). Probability might increase slightly (~5pp) as more diplomatic events could shift sentiment.

**If timeframe halved (5-6 days)**: Less time for any positive news to emerge. Probability would decrease (~5pp) as the recent negative news would dominate.

## (d) Justification

**Starting point**: Outside view estimated current hidden Metaculus value at ~34%, with 56% probability it's already >31%.

**Major inside-view updates:**

1. **Al-Burhan's categorical rejection (3 Feb)**: This is the most significant new information. The SAF leader explicitly stated no ceasefire while RSF holds cities. This directly contradicts ceasefire prospects and would cause rational Metaculus forecasters to lower their predictions. **Impact: -8 to -12pp on underlying probability.**

2. **Immediate violence after Kadugli**: The cycle of military advance → drone attack shows active escalation, not de-escalation. **Impact: -3 to -5pp.**

3. **No SAF response to Quad proposal**: Continued silence on the November 2025 proposal, now 2+ months old, suggests non-engagement. **Impact: -2 to -3pp.**

4. **Offsetting factor - Active diplomacy**: UK UNSC presidency and Hamdok's tour show sustained international effort. However, these are weak signals compared to Al-Burhan's direct statement. **Impact: +2 to +3pp.**

**Net adjustment**: -11 to -17pp from the baseline 34% → new estimated Metaculus value: 17-23%.

**Probability calculation**:
If current Metaculus is ~20% (midpoint), probability it's >31% requires either:
- It's already >31% (very unlikely given new information), OR
- It rises >11pp in 11 days (historically rare absent major breakthrough)

Given Al-Burhan's statement was made on 3 Feb (yesterday), Metaculus forecasters are likely already incorporating this information or will within 24-48 hours. The community prediction likely dropped or will drop below 31%.

**Revised probability**: 25% that Metaculus community prediction will be >31% on Feb 15.

## Probability Calibration

My outside view suggested 56% based on an inferred current Metaculus value of ~34%. However, Al-Burhan's explicit ceasefire rejection on 3 Feb is a major negative update that:
- Directly addresses the resolution criteria (ceasefire prospects)
- Comes from the key decision-maker
- Is recent enough that Metaculus hasn't fully incorporated it yet (or is incorporating it now)

The question is meta-level: will the Metaculus community be above 31%? Given:
- Strong negative news just broke (3 Feb)
- 11 days is enough time for community to incorporate this
- Historical patterns show communities respond to leader statements within 48-72 hours
- No scheduled positive catalysts before Feb 15 except UK UNSC meeting on Feb 19 (after resolution)

I estimate current Metaculus is likely 25-35% (wide range due to uncertainty about incorporation speed), with central estimate ~30%. The probability it's >31% on Feb 15 is approximately 35-40%.

**Adjustment for overconfidence**: The meta-prediction layer adds uncertainty. Perhaps Metaculus forecasters weight Al-Burhan's rhetoric less heavily than I do, or diplomatic optimism persists longer. Adjusting upward slightly: **38%**.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Metaculus community predict >31% chance of Sudan ceasefire (≥30 days duration) in 2026, measured on Feb 15, 2026?

2. **Base rate**: Outside view: 56% based on inferred ~34% current Metaculus value. Inside view significantly shifts this downward due to Al-Burhan's rejection.

3. **Consistency**: "38 out of 100 times, the Metaculus community prediction on Feb 15 exceeds 31%." This aligns with recent negative news being incorporated but acknowledges uncertainty in meta-prediction.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Al-Burhan explicitly rejected ceasefire on 3 Feb (verified, AFP)
   - Immediate violence after Kadugli siege break (verified, AFP)
   - No SAF response to Quad proposal for 2+ months (verified, CFR)
   - Active UK/international diplomacy ongoing (verified, multiple)

5. **Blind spot**: Surprise diplomatic breakthrough at UK UNSC meeting or secret negotiations becoming public could cause rapid upward revision. However, Feb 19 meeting is after resolution date.

6. **Status quo**: Current trajectory is continued fighting. The 11-day window is short, and absent major news, communities tend toward inertia. However, the Al-Burhan statement is major news that breaks status quo assumptions.

Probability: 38%
