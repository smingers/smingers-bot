Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Polymarket Article (Sudan Civil War Ceasefire)**
- **Quality**: Moderate. This is a prediction market showing crowd sentiment rather than expert analysis.
- **Key Facts**: Market probabilities show 12% chance of ceasefire by March 31, 2026, 32% by June 30, 2026, and 58% by December 31, 2026. Total volume of $53,828 suggests reasonable market liquidity.
- **Opinions vs Facts**: The percentages are market predictions, not expert opinions. The resolution criteria are factual definitions.

**Manifold Markets Article**
- **Quality**: Low for factual content. Another prediction market showing 30% probability for ceasefire during 2026.
- **Key Facts**: 201 traders participating suggests decent crowd wisdom aggregation.
- **Opinions vs Facts**: Pure market sentiment; no expert opinions or new factual information.

**The Media Line Article (February 1, 2026)**
- **Quality**: High. Recent news article with specific diplomatic developments.
- **Key Facts**: Egypt and Saudi Arabia held diplomatic talks calling for humanitarian truce leading to comprehensive ceasefire. No concrete ceasefire agreement reported as of February 1, 2026.
- **Opinions vs Facts**: Factual reporting of diplomatic activity; the call for ceasefire is a fact, but outcome remains uncertain.

**AllAfrica Article (Sudan Intelligence Meeting)**
- **Quality**: High. Contains named expert sources and specific details about January 2026 meetings.
- **Key Facts**: US-Sudan intelligence meetings in January 2026 deliberately excluded ceasefire discussions. Focus was on counterterrorism, not peace negotiations.
- **Expert Opinions**: 
  - Hamid Khalafallah (Sudanese researcher): Characterized engagement as "short-term tactical" and noted SAF's reliance on Islamist networks and Iranian support makes distancing "quite tough."
  - Cameron Hudson (US-Africa policy expert): Confirmed US priority is counterterrorism, not peace-building.
- **Significance**: Strong signal that major powers are not actively pursuing ceasefire negotiations as of late January 2026.

**Al Jazeera Article (Ukraine talks)**
- **Quality**: High quality source but irrelevant to Sudan question.
- **Relevance**: Zero direct relevance to Sudan Civil War ceasefire.

**Agent Report on Metaculus Question #41144**
- **Quality**: High quality investigation, thorough methodology.
- **Key Finding**: Question #41144 is not publicly accessible. Cannot retrieve historical probability data or trends.
- **Implication**: We cannot observe how the Metaculus community has been updating predictions on the underlying Sudan ceasefire question, which is critical information for our meta-prediction.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Metaculus community predictions on civil war ceasefires**: Most relevant but data unavailable due to question #41144 being inaccessible.

2. **Prediction market probabilities for Sudan ceasefire in early 2026**: 
   - Polymarket: 12% by March 31, 2026
   - Manifold: 30% for entire year 2026
   - These provide anchors but don't directly tell us what Metaculus community prediction will be on February 15.

3. **Metaculus community prediction behavior on binary geopolitical questions**:
   - Metaculus tends toward moderate probabilities (20-80%) on uncertain geopolitical events
   - Community often anchors to recent news and adjusts incrementally
   - Given we're 11 days from resolution date, community likely has formed relatively stable view

4. **Status quo baseline for February 15, 2026 prediction**:
   - Current date is February 4, 2026
   - Resolution date is February 15, 2026 (11 days away)
   - Recent news (February 1) shows diplomatic calls but no concrete progress
   - January 2026 US-Sudan meetings excluded ceasefire discussions

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: The prediction market probabilities combined with status quo analysis, since we cannot access the actual Metaculus question data.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 11 days (February 4 to February 15, 2026)

**Key Considerations**:
- The Metaculus question asks about ceasefire "during 2026" (roughly 11 months remaining)
- With 11 months left in the year, there's substantial time for diplomatic developments
- However, recent evidence (late January/early February 2026) shows:
  - No active ceasefire negotiations
  - Major powers focused on other priorities (US on counterterrorism)
  - Only diplomatic "calls" for ceasefire, not concrete talks
  
**Historical Pattern Analysis**:
- Polymarket shows 12% probability for ceasefire by March 31 (less than 2 months away)
- Polymarket shows 32% by June 30 (5 months away)
- Manifold shows 30% for entire year
- This suggests markets see low near-term probability but increasing likelihood over longer timeframes

**11-Day Window Considerations**:
- In 11 days, major news could shift Metaculus community prediction
- However, absent dramatic developments, predictions tend to be sticky in short windows
- Current trajectory shows no ceasefire momentum as of February 1-4

## (d) Justification

The question asks whether the Metaculus community prediction will be **higher than 31.00%** on February 15, 2026.

**Key Factors Supporting Prediction Below 31%**:
1. Recent diplomatic activity (February 1) shows only "calls" for ceasefire, not active negotiations
2. US-Sudan meetings in January explicitly excluded ceasefire discussions
3. Polymarket shows only 12% chance of ceasefire by March 31, suggesting low near-term optimism
4. Expert opinion (Khalafallah) indicates structural barriers to ceasefire (SAF's reliance on Islamist/Iranian support)
5. With 11 months remaining in 2026, a 31% probability would be relatively low for a full-year window, suggesting community skepticism

**Key Factors Supporting Prediction Above 31%**:
1. Manifold shows 30% for full year, very close to threshold
2. 11 months is substantial time for unexpected diplomatic breakthroughs
3. Regional powers (Egypt, Saudi Arabia) are actively calling for ceasefire
4. Metaculus communities sometimes maintain higher probabilities than pure market sentiment

**Critical Uncertainty**: We cannot observe the actual Metaculus question #41144, so we don't know:
- Current community prediction (could already be above or below 31%)
- Recent trend direction
- Community's typical calibration on similar questions

**Base Rate Reasoning**: Given:
- Manifold at 30% (just below threshold)
- Polymarket at 12% for near-term, 32% for mid-year
- Recent news showing no concrete progress
- 11-day window unlikely to see dramatic shifts absent major news

The most likely scenario is that Metaculus community prediction on February 15 will be in the 25-35% range, making this a close call around the 31% threshold.

Outside view calibration:

The threshold of 31.00% is very close to the Manifold market prediction of 30%. This proximity is significant—it suggests the question setter chose a threshold near current market consensus to create a roughly 50-50 proposition.

However, several factors tilt toward a prediction BELOW 31%:

1. **Market positioning**: Manifold at 30% is already slightly below threshold, and Polymarket's more granular time-based markets show only 12% for March 31 (suggesting even lower probability for near-term developments that would boost full-year estimates).

2. **Recent negative news**: The January 2026 US-Sudan meetings explicitly excluding ceasefire talks, combined with expert assessment of structural barriers, likely pushed community predictions downward in late January/early February.

3. **Time decay without progress**: As days pass without ceasefire progress, communities typically adjust probabilities downward for near-term milestones, though this effect is partially offset by the long remaining window (11 months in 2026).

4. **Conservative anchoring**: Metaculus communities tend to be somewhat more conservative than play-money prediction markets, though this effect is modest.

5. **11-day stability**: With only 11 days until resolution, absent major breaking news, the community prediction is likely relatively stable. If it's currently near 28-30%, it's unlikely to jump above 31% without concrete diplomatic developments.

**Calibration**: I estimate approximately 35-40% probability that the Metaculus community prediction will be above 31.00% on February 15. The close proximity to Manifold's 30% creates uncertainty, but the preponderance of recent evidence suggests the community prediction is more likely below than above the threshold.
