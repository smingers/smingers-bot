Analysis:
### 1) Paraphrase / what resolves
This resolves **Yes** iff the **Metaculus community prediction** for “Will there be a ceasefire in the Sudanese Civil War during 2026?” is **> 31.00% at 2026-02-15 04:04:09**; otherwise **No**. (If the target resolves early, this resolves to the target’s resolved value.)

### (a) Source analysis (quality, date, facts vs opinions)
- **AFP (Feb 3, 2026) – Kadugli siege broken; RSF drone strike; Burhan: “no truce…”**  
  *Quality:* High (wire service, on-the-ground details, attributable quotes). *Date:* Very recent.  
  *Facts:* SAF lifted siege; RSF drone attack; displacement/famine context; **Burhan quoted rejecting ceasefire while RSF occupies cities**; mentions recent US–Saudi truce proposal.  
  *Opinion:* Minimal; mostly reporting + direct quotes.

- **UN News (Feb 3, 2026, French) – 1000+ days war; Quad supports humanitarian ceasefire efforts**  
  *Quality:* High for institutional stance and humanitarian figures; less granular on negotiations. *Date:* Very recent.  
  *Facts:* Humanitarian severity; funding needs; UN support for Quad diplomacy; “fragile” effort.  
  *Opinion:* UN framing that diplomacy should pursue humanitarian ceasefire.

- **Africanews (Jan 15, 2026) – Cairo talks; calls for nationwide humanitarian truce**  
  *Quality:* Medium-high; mainstream outlet, named officials. *Date:* Recent but ~3 weeks old.  
  *Facts:* Talks resumed; Egypt/UN/US call for truce; prior failures noted.  
  *Opinion:* Lamamra says diplomacy viable (attributable).

- **Brookings (Jan 14, 2026) – roadmap; external backers; “quartet” truce concept**  
  *Quality:* High (think tank analysis). *Date:* Recent.  
  *Facts:* Structural drivers (UAE/Egypt/Saudi roles, gold flows, displacement).  
  *Opinion/analysis:* Recommendations + interpretation of incentives; still useful for structural base rates.

- **CFR (Feb 3, 2026) – humanitarian crisis explainer + “Forgotten War”**  
  *Quality:* High (policy analysis), though partly synthesis. *Date:* Very recent.  
  *Facts:* масштабы displacement/hunger; history of failed initiatives; foreign support patterns; notes RSF “accepted” a proposal while SAF didn’t (as reported by CFR).  
  *Opinion:* Expert interpretation that leverage is weak and war likely to persist.

- **Sky News Arabia (Feb 3, 2026) – Hamdok lobbying for Quadrilateral Initiative / truce**  
  *Quality:* Medium (regional outlet; political messaging). *Date:* Very recent.  
  *Facts:* Hamdok meetings; stated goal: immediate humanitarian ceasefire; “broad backing” claim.  
  *Opinion:* Advocacy; may overstate consensus.

- **ABC News (Nov 26, 2025) – “top general says they will enter a three-month ceasefire”**  
  *Quality:* Unclear/low-moderate given the extracted content is thin and may be a brief headline. *Date:* Old relative to today.  
  *Facts:* Claim of intended 3‑month humanitarian ceasefire.  
  *Caution:* Subsequent Feb 2026 reporting suggests no stable ceasefire, so this is weakly informative now.

- **Al Jazeera opinion (Jan 17, 2026) – Darfur governor warns “truce of separation”**  
  *Quality:* Medium for understanding elite fears; it’s an op-ed. *Date:* Recent.  
  *Facts:* Limited; mostly narrative.  
  *Opinion:* Strongly skeptical; highlights internal political constraints against a truce.

(Other included items about **South Sudan** are not relevant to Sudan ceasefire forecasting and get near-zero weight.)

### (b) Evidence analysis using the weighing system
**Strong evidence (pushes Metaculus community prediction down):**
- **Direct attributable quote from SAF leader Burhan (AFP Feb 3):** “no truce, no ceasefire so long as the RSF occupies cities,” and rejection/stonewalling of proposals.  
  *Mechanism:* If one main belligerent publicly conditions/refuses ceasefire, near-term ceasefire odds fall; Metaculus users typically react quickly to such salient, credible statements.

**Moderate evidence (mixed, small net down):**
- **Repeated pattern of failed diplomacy + weak leverage** (CFR synthesis; Brookings structural incentives; Africanews noting multiple failed attempts).  
  *Mechanism:* Persistent external patronage + battlefield incentives reduce likelihood of any meaningful 2026 ceasefire; community tends to anchor to “long war” base rates.
- **Ongoing intensified fighting events** (Kadugli drone strike same day as siege break) reinforcing active combat trend (AFP).  
  *Mechanism:* Hot war → lower near-term ceasefire expectations; sometimes lowers even “during year” expectations.

**Moderate evidence (pushes up a bit):**
- **Active diplomatic calendar and “Quad” push for humanitarian truce** (UN News Feb 3; Africanews Jan 15; Sky News Arabia Feb 3).  
  *Mechanism:* More mediation attempts increase the chance of at least a temporary/partial ceasefire sometime in 2026, even if fragile.

**Weak evidence (minimal effect):**
- **ABC Nov 2025 “three-month ceasefire” headline**: contradicted by later reporting; unclear if implemented.  
- **Al Jazeera op-ed skepticism**: informative on constraints but not a probabilistic datapoint.

**Net evidential pull vs outside view:** modest **downward** pressure because the newest, highest-signal datapoint is SAF’s public refusal/conditionality, which tends to move community forecasts below nearby thresholds like 31%.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time until the community snapshot:** ~11 days (from 2026-02-04 to 2026-02-15).  
- Community predictions are typically **sticky over 11 days** unless there is a clear “breakthrough” headline (signed truce, verified talks success, major external coercion) or dramatic battlefield collapse.
- If the timeframe were **halved (~5–6 days)**: even more stickiness → my probability of “>31%” would drop slightly.  
- If the timeframe were **doubled (~22 days)**: more chance for a headline diplomatic development → probability would rise modestly.

### (d) Justification: inside-view adjustment from the outside-view base rate
**Outside view base rate given:** 38% chance that Metaculus community prediction will be >31% on Feb 15.

**Inside-view updates:**
1. **SAF leader’s explicit “no ceasefire” stance (AFP Feb 3)** is a high-credibility, high-salience signal likely to **pull community estimates down** (especially near-term optimism, and often also dampening “during 2026” optimism because it signals bargaining positions are far apart).  
2. **Diplomatic activity exists** (UN/Quad, Cairo mechanism, Hamdok lobbying), but it looks like **pressure without buy-in**; this is common in Sudan conflict history and usually doesn’t cause sustained probability jumps without an agreement.  
3. With only **11 days** to the snapshot, absent a signed truce, I expect **mean reversion toward ~high-20s/low-30s** rather than a decisive move above 31.

So I adjust **38% → 33%** for “community prediction > 31%” at the snapshot time.

Probability calibration
- **Inside-view probability (Yes = Metaculus community prediction >31% on 2026-02-15): 33%**.  
- Interpreting a ±10% change:  
  - At **43%**, I’d need to believe either (i) current community prediction is already comfortably above 31, or (ii) a breakthrough headline is moderately likely within 11 days.  
  - At **23%**, I’d need to believe the community is already well below 31 (mid‑20s) and will likely drift downward further.

Checklist:
1) Criteria match: Yes iff Metaculus community prediction on Q41144 at 2026-02-15 04:04:09 is >31%.  
2) Outside view anchor: 38%.  
3) Consistency: 33 out of 100 times, the community prediction at the snapshot exceeds 31%.  
4) Key evidence: (i) Burhan “no truce” quote (AFP Feb 3). (ii) Continued fighting incl. drone strike (AFP). (iii) Ongoing but historically-failing diplomacy (UN News/Africanews/Brookings/CFR).  
5) Blind spot: a sudden signed humanitarian truce (even short/partial) could spike community prediction above 31 quickly.  
6) Status quo: absent a breakthrough, expectation is little movement or slight downward drift.

Probability: 33%
