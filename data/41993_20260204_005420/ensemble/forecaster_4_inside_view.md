Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological core set)

1. Manifold market mirroring Metaculus (30 % on 2026-02-02).  
   • Factual: price, trader count ≈201.  
   • Quality: medium-high – same resolution wording, active traders, but smaller user base and play-money dynamics.

2. Polymarket “Official Sudan cease-fire by date” (12 % ≤ Mar 31; 32 % ≤ Jun 30; 58 % ≤ Dec 31).  
   • Factual: prices/volumes.  
   • Quality: medium – real money, but stricter definition than Metaculus; thin liquidity in longer buckets.

3. Africanews, Brookings, AFP, UN News, etc. (Jan–3 Feb 2026).  
   • Factual: renewed Cairo talks, Quad humanitarian-truce push, SAF breaks Kadugli siege while publicly rejecting any cease-fire “while RSF occupies cities”.  
   • Opinions: diplomats’ optimism (UN envoy Lamamra, Hamdok) vs. Governor of Darfur’s scepticism.  
   • Quality: mainstream newswires and think-tanks; broadly reliable for factual battlefield/diplomatic status.

4. No direct time-series from Metaculus question 41144 is publicly available – acknowledged blind-spot.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to “Metaculus forecast > 31 % on 15 Feb”)

Strong evidence (downwards)  
• SAF leader Burhan reiterates “no truce, no cease-fire” (AFP 3 Feb) – structural veto from one principal.  
• Repeated failure of previous Saudi/US “three-month truce” plan (Nov 2025) – historical pattern of collapse.

Moderate evidence (upwards)  
• Fifth Cairo meeting (15 Jan) + Quad’s renewed roadmap; diplomacy still alive.  
• Manifold price already at 30 %, suggesting Metaculus could plausibly sit near threshold.

Weak evidence  
• UN/IOC Olympic truce call; IMF growth scenario contingent on peace – aspirational, few causal links to 15-Feb prediction window.

Net weighting: two strong pieces discourage a sizeable upward swing; moderate pieces keep the probability from collapsing to very low values.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• 11 days until lock. Metaculus long-horizon geopolitics tracks normally drift ≤ 2-3 pp over such a window unless a game-changing headline drops.  
• Halving the window to 5-6 days would reduce expected drift further (prob ↓ ~2 pp). Doubling to three weeks would increase room for a diplomatic surprise, raising tail risk of > 31 % by ~3 pp.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside view: treat unknown Metaculus number as N(30 %, σ≈3 %). P(>31) = 37 %.

Inside view adjustments:  
• Slight downward drift expected (continued violence, SAF public rejection) → −0.5 pp mean.  
• Limited upside catalysts identified in next 11 days.  
Re-compute with mean 29.5 %, σ 3 % ⇒ P(>31) ≈ 32 %.

I conservatively add 1 pp for cross-platform bias uncertainty (Metaculus sometimes 1–2 pp higher than Manifold on conflicts). Final rounded probability: 33 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that about 33 times out of 100, the Metaculus community prediction will stand strictly above 31 % at 04:04 UTC on 15 Feb 2026, otherwise not.”

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Metaculus crowd forecast for a 2026 Sudan cease-fire exceed 31 % on 15 Feb 2026?  
2. Base rate: N(30,3) → 37 %.  
3. Consistency line above.  
4. Key evidence: a) Manifold proxy 30 %; b) SAF “no cease-fire” 3 Feb; c) Quad talks stalled since Nov 2025; d) 11-day window limits drift.  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden jointly-announced 30-day humanitarian pause before 15 Feb could spike Metaculus >40 %.  
6. Status-quo bias acknowledged – violence continuing makes upward move harder than downward.

Probability: 33%
