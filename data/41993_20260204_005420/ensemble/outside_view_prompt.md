You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 31.00% on 2026-02-15 for the Metaculus question "Will there be a ceasefire in the Sudanese Civil War during 2026?"?

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41144) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-15 04:04:09 is higher than 31.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 31.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-15 04:04:09, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

# Summary: Sudan Intelligence Meeting in Washington

## Key Facts and Events

**Meeting Details:**
- Sudan's Armed Forces (SAF)-aligned government intelligence director, Gen. Ahmed Mufaddal, held meetings in Washington, DC in January 2026 with members of the US intelligence community
- The meetings were kept deliberately low-profile and were not publicly announced
- **Notably, ceasefire discussions were NOT included in the talks**

**Meeting Focus:**
- Discussions were narrowly framed around "mutual security files" including:
  - Counterterrorism cooperation
  - Intelligence sharing related to extremist networks
  - US concerns about Sudan's ties with Iran
- Meetings were described as "technical in nature" and limited to security priorities rather than political negotiations or broader diplomatic engagement

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources)

**Hamid Khalafallah** (Sudanese researcher familiar with the meeting):
- Characterized the engagement as "short-term tactical engagement that is very circumstantial"
- Described it as "the US lecturing the government in Port Sudan on how to behave" rather than genuine dialogue
- Noted that SAF's support comes primarily from Islamist networks and Iranian links: "These are the only ways they've gotten support so far – fighters on the ground, access to money, access to weapons"
- Argued that distancing from these supporters would be "quite tough" for Port Sudan
- Linked timing to regional developments involving Iran and Israeli security concerns

**Cameron Hudson** (US-Africa policy expert):
- Framed the engagement pragmatically: "This isn't about building trust. It's about advancing interests that both sides have"
- Noted that "Washington has said that its top priority in all of Africa is counterterrorism"
- Stated "My understanding is that is what was agreed" regarding assurances on counterterrorism cooperation

## Context on Sudan's Alliances
- Port Sudan government faces scrutiny over reported military and logistical ties with Iran
- SAF relies on Islamist networks for manpower, financing, and weapons access
- Regional rivalries (particularly UAE narratives against SAF) complicate Port Sudan's diplomatic positioning

<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve full time-series data for Metaculus question 41144; list major probability moves since 2025-12-01 with associated news headlines; summarize trend in last two weeks.
A fresh round of targeted searches again failed to surface any public trace—HTML, JSON, cached copy, forum citation, GitHub data file, screenshot, or secondary commentary—of Metaculus question #41144.

1. Google’s web index still returns zero hits on the literal identifier. Both broad keyword probes such as “Metaculus question 41144” and structured API-style strings like “site:metaculus.com/api2 41144” produced the message “No usable content extracted,” i.e., an empty result set (Google search results above). The same null outcome recurred for alternative phrasings such as “Metaculus 41144 probability jump news” and “Metaculus screenshot 41144 png.”

2. GitHub repositories that mirror the full public Metaculus catalogue likewise contain no reference to 41144. The Metaculus-maintained “forecasting-tools” repository—whose API wrapper automatically sweeps every accessible question—shows no filenames or commit diffs that include the number 41144 (GitHub result: Metaculus/forecasting-tools). Third-party datasets used in academic analyses of Metaculus data (e.g., Rethink Priorities’ study of resolved AI questions) do not list the ID either.

3. Wider web discussion remains silent. Reddit, EA Forum, LessWrong, and other forecast-oriented communities commonly cite question IDs when debating interesting markets, yet no posts surfaced that include “41144” in conjunction with “Metaculus.” The search term “Metaculus unpublished question leak,” designed to pick up any disclosure of private or deleted items, returned no relevant pages.

4. Absence from the Internet Archive continues. Although not re-queried in this batch, earlier CDX checks against both the HTML page URL and the JSON timeline endpoint for 41144 yielded no snapshots—a strong indication that web crawlers never saw the resource.

Synthesis of current evidence
• Every public-facing channel that normally exposes Metaculus data remains empty, suggesting that question #41144 has never been publicly crawlable.  
• The most plausible explanations are: (a) the item resides in “private research” mode, visible only to invited accounts; (b) it is confined to a gated tournament interface that masks regular URLs and API endpoints; or (c) it has been hard-deleted from production databases.

Impact on the original deliverables
The user’s requested outputs—(i) full time-series data, (ii) a chronology of major probability swings since 2025-12-01 with accompanying news headlines, and (iii) a two-week trend synopsis—all presuppose access to at least the timeline JSON or a front-end chart. No such data can be collected externally; therefore none of the deliverables can be generated in an evidence-based manner.

Remaining information gaps that prevent completion
1. Authoritative confirmation from Metaculus staff (or from organizers of any private tournament) of the question’s visibility status.  
2. Any artefact—screenshot, PDF export, user note—that contains a single probability value or even the title of question #41144. Such a clue could enable indirect reconstruction of the timeline via community estimates or press coverage.  
3. If the question is tournament-restricted, the tournament slug or name; with that, authenticated API calls might be feasible.

Without at least one of these pieces, further open-source research is unlikely to break the impasse.

Conclusion
All available search outputs converge on the assessment that Metaculus question #41144 is not publicly accessible. Consequently, the time-series data, probability-move log, and recent trend analysis requested in the original query cannot be produced at this time. Additional, non-public information—most plausibly direct confirmation or data release from Metaculus—is required to proceed.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
