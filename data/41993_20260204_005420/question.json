    "description": "Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41144\n- Original question title: Will there be a ceasefire in the Sudanese Civil War during 2026?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-01: 31.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> This question will resolve as **Yes** if a bilateral ceasefire in the Sudanese Civil War has gone into effect during 2026. The ceasefire must either\n> \n> * last a minimum of 30 consecutive days entirely during 2026\n> \n> or\n> \n> * be intended to last a minimum of 30 days (or indefinitely), as specified by the agreement text or joint statement, even if it is immediately violated.\n> \n> If either the Rapid Support Forces or Sudanese Armed Forces are completely defeated, such that they control no permanent territory, this question will also resolve as **Yes**.\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> A ceasefire will qualify if it is mutually agreed by the RSF and SAF and applies to all fighting against the other by both sides.\n> \n> A ceasefire will have considered to have lasted if both the RSF and SAF agree that is has remained in effect and full scale fighting has not occurred. Minor ceasefire violations, while both sides agree to continue the ceasefire will not impact this question.\n\nOriginal background: \n> On 15 April 2023, Sudan collapsed into [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_civil_war_\\(2023%E2%80%93present\\)) between the [Rapid Support Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces) (RSF) and the [Sudanese Armed Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_Armed_Forces) (SAF). Following the [2021 Sudanese Coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Sudanese_coup_d'%C3%A9tat) and subsequent ousting of former leader [Omar al-Bashir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_al-Bashir), the rival factions gained substantial control of Sudan.\n> \n> Although initially promising elections, tensions between the two forces escalated, and the RSF began to recruit soldiers before mobilizing on April 13, and attacking SAF bases on April 15, 2025.\n> \n> The civil war has led to hundreds of thousands dead and displaced millions, while [famine struck](https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/news-stories/stories/sudans-children-are-suffering-how-conflict-destroying-their-future_en) across the nation. On 22 May, 2025, a brief one day [ceasefire was agreed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-65683681), however following it's collapse, little concrete action has been taken towards peace.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41144,\"question_id\":40845,\"last_cp\":0.31}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41144) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-15 04:04:09 is higher than 31.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 31.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-15 04:04:09, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.",
