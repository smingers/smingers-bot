Analysis:
The Metaculus community prediction will move primarily in response to any credible signals of an impending or recently-agreed ceasefire, or evidence that negotiations are making tangible progress. Therefore the most relevant current information will cover:
• Announcements of new mediation initiatives (e.g., IGAD, AU, Saudi-US “Jeddah talks”, UAE, Egypt, or UN)
• Statements from RSF or SAF leadership hinting at willingness to pause fighting
• Reports of humanitarian “windows”, local truces or confidence-building measures that could be scaled up
• Shifts in front-line dynamics suggesting one side is close to military exhaustion/defeat
• External pressure such as new sanctions or incentives tied to a ceasefire
Fresh reporting from the first week of February 2026 is especially important; even rumors of a scheduled negotiating round could push the Metaculus probability above the current 31 %.
