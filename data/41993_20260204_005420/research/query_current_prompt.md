Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41144
- Original question title: Will there be a ceasefire in the Sudanese Civil War during 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-01: 31.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as **Yes** if a bilateral ceasefire in the Sudanese Civil War has gone into effect during 2026. The ceasefire must either
> 
> * last a minimum of 30 consecutive days entirely during 2026
> 
> or
> 
> * be intended to last a minimum of 30 days (or indefinitely), as specified by the agreement text or joint statement, even if it is immediately violated.
> 
> If either the Rapid Support Forces or Sudanese Armed Forces are completely defeated, such that they control no permanent territory, this question will also resolve as **Yes**.

Original fine print: 
> A ceasefire will qualify if it is mutually agreed by the RSF and SAF and applies to all fighting against the other by both sides.
> 
> A ceasefire will have considered to have lasted if both the RSF and SAF agree that is has remained in effect and full scale fighting has not occurred. Minor ceasefire violations, while both sides agree to continue the ceasefire will not impact this question.

Original background: 
> On 15 April 2023, Sudan collapsed into [civil war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_civil_war_\(2023%E2%80%93present\)) between the [Rapid Support Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rapid_Support_Forces) (RSF) and the [Sudanese Armed Forces](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sudanese_Armed_Forces) (SAF). Following the [2021 Sudanese Coup](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2021_Sudanese_coup_d'%C3%A9tat) and subsequent ousting of former leader [Omar al-Bashir](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Omar_al-Bashir), the rival factions gained substantial control of Sudan.
> 
> Although initially promising elections, tensions between the two forces escalated, and the RSF began to recruit soldiers before mobilizing on April 13, and attacking SAF bases on April 15, 2025.
> 
> The civil war has led to hundreds of thousands dead and displaced millions, while [famine struck](https://civil-protection-humanitarian-aid.ec.europa.eu/news-stories/stories/sudans-children-are-suffering-how-conflict-destroying-their-future_en) across the nation. On 22 May, 2025, a brief one day [ceasefire was agreed](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-65683681), however following it's collapse, little concrete action has been taken towards peace.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41144) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-15 04:04:09 is higher than 31.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 31.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-15 04:04:09, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For AskNews:
Your query for AskNews will be processed more naturally, so feel free to write a sentence-long query in natural language. Avoid using ambiguous acronyms. Specify relevant criteria (e.g., geography, industry, time period) to ensure the correct scope. If desired, you can indicate multiple kinds of news articles you're looking for in your query. Keep your query to a maximum of two sentences. Important note: Do not prefix your query with 'AskNews:' or something similar. Please add the word 'AskNews' enclosed in brackets at the end of the query, referring closely to the example below.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () (NOT curly brackets, NOT square brackets [], you need to use normal brackets ()) **on the same line as and after** the query, applicable for Google, Google News and AskNews. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for AskNews.

Use the following verification checklist:
1. One query for google?
2. One query for google news?
3. One query for AskNews?
4. All queries followed by either (Google), (Google News) or (AskNews) in brackets () on the same line as the query?
