Analysis:
The key to judging whether the Metaculus community prediction will climb above 31 % by 2026-02-15 is understanding two things:  
1. How the probability on the Metaculus question has behaved up to now (direction, momentum, reactions to specific news).  
2. Whether any fresh diplomatic, military or humanitarian developments between now and 2026-02-15 could plausibly nudge forecasters upward.  

Therefore the most relevant historical context is:  
• A time-series of the Metaculus community prediction so we can see recent trend velocity and identify inflection points tied to news.  
• Recent and breaking news about ceasefire negotiations, external mediation (e.g., AU, IGAD, UAE-Saudi-US), battlefield stalemates, or impending humanitarian collapse that could make a 2026 ceasefire more likely.  
Gathering both will give the “outside view” on how sensitive the crowd forecast is to new information and what events could push it higher than 31 %.
