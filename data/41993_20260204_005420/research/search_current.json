The city, previously a symbol of diversity and coexistence, has been devastated and emptied of its population.\n\n2. **Ceasefire Timing:** The international community has proposed a \"humanitarian ceasefire\" after the el-Fasher catastrophe occurred, not before it. The RSF had previously rejected humanitarian commitments, including protection of hospitals and safe corridors for civilians.\n\n3. **Humanitarian Operations:** Humanitarian organizations have been operating in most regions of Sudan, including Darfur, despite security complexities and without a legal, signed ceasefire.\n\n4. **Current Negotiation Context:** The situation involves two parties both claiming to represent \"the government\" within a single state: the legitimate government of Sudan and the RSF seeking to establish a parallel entity.\n\n## Opinions from Named Source (Author - Governor of Darfur Region):\n\n1. **Suspicion of Ceasefire Motives:** The author expresses \"legitimate political suspicion\" about the timing of the ceasefire, questioning why it's being pushed now and in whose interest.\n\n2. **Risk of Fragmentation:** The author warns that the ceasefire could be \"an entry point for dismantling the Sudanese state\" rather than saving it, potentially leading to zones of influence, multiple armies, different currencies, parallel institutions, and eventual state fragmentation.\n\n3. **Historical Parallels:** Cites examples where humanitarian ceasefires became preludes to fragmentation (Western Sahara, Libya, Somalia, Yemen, South Sudan). Specifically mentions Operation Lifeline Sudan (1989) as a case where humanitarian action became a political entry point that eventually led to South Sudan's secession.\n\n4. **Legitimacy Concerns:** Argues that joint signing with the RSF would grant the rebel party \"parity and legitimacy,\" contradicting Sudan's unity and sovereignty principles.\n\n5. **Lack of Transparency:** Criticizes that negotiations are conducted behind closed doors without Sudanese people's knowledge or oversight.\n\n6. **Strategic Warning:** While acknowledging the need to protect civilians, the author warns the ceasefire \"may carry temporary stability at the cost of a devastating strategic price: The erosion of Sudan's unity.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://abcnews.go.com/International/video/sudans-top-general-enter-month-humanitarian-ceasefire-127896618\">\n# Summary of Article\n\n**Source:** ABC News  \n**Date:** November 26, 2025  \n**Title:** Sudan's top general says they will enter a three-month humanitarian ceasefire\n\n## Key Information:\n\n### Facts and Statements:\n1. **Ceasefire Announcement:** Sudan's top general announced they will enter a three-month humanitarian ceasefire.\n\n2. **International Proposal:** The United States, United Arab Emirates, Egypt, and Saudi Arabia proposed a plan earlier in the month (November 2025) for a three-month ceasefire followed by peace talks.\n\n### Note:\nThe article appears to be primarily a headline/brief announcement with limited detail.

Khartoum is where the White Nile and Blue Nile converge to form the Nile River.\n\n- **Humanitarian Crisis:** According to the U.N., Sudan \"is now the world's worst humanitarian crisis for women and girls\" with over 12 million people displaced (more than half being women and girls). Women and girls are being deliberately targeted with sexual violence.\n\n- **Economic Impact:** Port Sudan is responsible for a combined $7.9 billion in exports and imports for the region. South Sudan's oil exports (90% of its government revenue) must transit through Sudan to reach international markets.\n\n- **Gold Trade:** Estimates put Sudanese gold exports to the UAE at more than $13.4 billion, which observers believe is the \"lifeblood\" of the civil war.\n\n- **Conflict Origins:** The current conflict began in April 2023 between the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by General Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti), and the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF), led by Gen. Abdel Fattah al-Burhan.\n\n## International Involvement:\n\n- **At least ten countries** have been drawn into Sudan's civil war through supplying weapons, financial resources, or political backing.\n\n- **U.S.-backed \"quartet\"** (Egypt, UAE, Saudi Arabia, and United States) has called for \"a three-month humanitarian truce\" followed by \"a nine-month political process,\" though details are not forthcoming.\n\n- **Foreign Support Patterns:**\n  - Saudi Arabia backs the SAF (economic aid and diplomatic mediation)\n  - UAE supports the RSF (allegedly due to concerns about Islamist groups)\n  - Egypt backs the SAF (due to historical ties between armies)\n\n- **U.S. Legislative Action:** On November 21, U.S. legislation was introduced seeking to halt American weapons sales to the UAE until the U.S. certifies that the UAE is not arming the RSF. However, Reuters notes the bill is \"unlikely to win significant support in Congress.\"\n\n## Expert Opinions:\n\n- **On RSF Victory:** Some analysts suggest that if Hemedti defeats the SAF, \"the Sudanese government, or remnants thereof, would become a wholly owned subsidiary of the commercial-military-ethnic agenda of the Dagalo family and its most powerful backers.\"\n\n- **On Paramilitary Governance:** Experts have stated that paramilitary governance \"destroys; it consumes; but it does not build, neither does it create institutional environments that enable peaceful coexistence or nation-building.\"\n\n- **On UAE Support:** It is generally believed that the RSF would not have been able to continue the civil war without the UAE's backing.\n\n## Proposed Pathways to Peace:\n\n1. The AU (African Union), working with regional organizations and Sudanese civil society, should seek a mediated ceasefire to allow humanitarian aid flow.\n\n2.

The war erupted on April 15, 2023, after the collapse of the alliance between Sudan's military leader, General Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and his former ally, General Mohamed Hamdan Daglo, known as 'Hemetti,' commander of the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). Since then, intense fighting has turned Khartoum and large parts of the country into battlefields, leading to state collapse and one of the worst humanitarian crises in modern history. According to UN spokesperson St\u00e9phane Dujarric, the UN supports diplomatic efforts by the 'Quad'\u2014the United States, Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE\u2014to secure a humanitarian ceasefire. The goal is to demilitarize key zones and rapidly scale up life-saving aid across Sudan. However, the effort remains fragile, dependent on the warring parties' willingness and international support. In South Kordofan, over 10,000 displaced people live in camps suffering from critical shortages of food, healthcare, clean water, sanitation, shelter, and education. Many fled Kadugli, Dilling, or regions in West Kordofan and Eastern Darfur, often after dangerous journeys through South Sudan marked by arbitrary detentions, theft, and family separations. In North Darfur, over 1,000 people have recently arrived in Tawila, facing the same shortages, with only basic meals provided by community kitchens. Displacement continues in Eastern Darfur and Blue Nile states, creating a shifting geography of suffering. The UN's 2026 humanitarian response plan requires $2.9 billion to assist over 20 million people; without this funding, the crisis will deepen further.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 08:11 PM\nSource:[UN News](https://news.un.org/fr/story/2026/02/1158337)\n\n**Hamdok Seeks to Halt Sudan's War and Mobilize Global Support for Quadrilateral Initiative in London**\nAbdullah Hamdok, head of the Civil Democratic Forces Alliance (SAMDOD), met with Baroness Jane Chapman, UK Minister for International Development, and Norwegian State Secretary Andreas Krafvik in London on Tuesday, February 3, 2026. The meeting focused on efforts to end the war in Sudan, with Hamdok emphasizing the urgent need for an immediate humanitarian ceasefire to enable aid delivery to affected populations amid deteriorating humanitarian conditions and ongoing fighting. The visit was part of a broader European tour by a SAMDOD delegation that included France, the Netherlands, Germany, and the UK, concluding on the same day. The mission aimed to mobilize international support for the 'Quadrilateral Initiative' as the most serious pathway to a comprehensive peaceful resolution, full civilian rule in Sudan, and intensified international pressure to halt combat and enforce an urgent humanitarian truce. The alliance stated that these demands enjoy broad international backing and clear consensus among the four core nations of the Quadrilateral\u2014comprising the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 03:14 PM\nSource:[\u0633\u0643\u0627\u064a \u0646\u064a\u0648\u0632 \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/middle-east/1850618-%D8%AD%D9%85%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%83-%D9%8A%D8%A8%D8%AD%D8%AB-%D9%84%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%86-%D9%88%D9%82%D9%81-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%88%D8%AD%D8%B4%D8%AF-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D8%B9%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%88%D9%84%D9%8A)\n\n**Sudan army breaks siege on Kadugli, RSF drone kills eight**\nOn February 3, 2026, the Sudanese army broke a prolonged siege on Kadugli, the capital of South Kordofan state, after nearly three years of conflict between the army and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The city, where the UN confirmed famine last year, had seen around 80% of its population\u2014approximately 147,000 people\u2014forced to flee due to blockade by RSF fighters and allies led by Abdelaziz al-Hilu. Following the army\u2019s advance, residents celebrated with ululations and victory signs, describing the moment as 'a great day' and expressing 'indescribable joy' after enduring months of starvation and fear. However, hours later, an RSF drone attack struck Kadugli, killing eight civilians\u2014including three children\u2014at a health center; all but one drone were intercepted by army defenses. The RSF claimed they remained nearby and would continue besieging Kadugli and Dilling, where the army had also recently broken a siege. The wider Kordofan region remains the war\u2019s fiercest battleground, with hundreds of thousands facing starvation. Since the conflict began in April 2023, it has killed tens of thousands, displaced 11 million, and driven multiple regions into famine. Army chief Abdel Fattah al-Burhan stated there would be 'no truce, no ceasefire so long as the RSF occupies cities,' rejecting a recent U.S.-Saudi truce proposal. The UN has documented atrocities including summary killings, abductions, and sexual violence in the region, while survivors described eating leaves and foraging for food, with some dying from poisoning. Drone strikes have killed dozens at a time, and over 88,000 people fled between October and January, according to UN data.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 02:44 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/94WY2ZQ)\n\n**Sudanese Army Breaks Siege on Kadugli in South Kordofan, Marking Major Military Advance**\nOn February 3, 2026, Sudanese Army Commander Abdel Fattah al-Burhan announced that Sudanese forces had broken the siege imposed by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and their local allies on the city of Kadugli in South Kordofan, marking a significant military advance. The siege, which had persisted for months and contributed to severe famine in Kadugli, was lifted after intense fighting along the road between Kadugli and Deling, a city previously liberated by the Sudanese army in January 2026. According to the Sudanese military, the operation was described as a 'heroic feat' and resulted in 'heavy losses' for the RSF in personnel and equipment. Witnesses, including resident Ismail Tiah, reported widespread celebration in Kadugli, with women singing and children rejoicing. However, the RSF confirmed the Sudanese army's entry into Kadugli but claimed they had infiltrated through unguarded rugged terrain and vowed to continue the siege. Since the war began in April 2023, over 11 million people have been displaced, and famine has spread across Sudan. The UN reported that 147,000 people\u201480% of Kadugli\u2019s population\u2014had fled the city. The Norwegian Refugee Council warned of a 'countdown to catastrophe' in South Kordofan, calling it the most dangerous frontline in Sudan and the most neglected. The UN has repeatedly warned of a repeat of the atrocities seen in El Fasher. Residents described extreme suffering, including eating tree leaves. Since October 2025, the region has suffered drone strikes, with one attack killing dozens. Over 88,000 people fled in just three months. Al-Burhan stated there would be no ceasefire while RSF occupies cities, emphasizing that Sudanese forces would respond to peace overtures but would not 'sell the blood of Sudanese people.' The Sudanese army has received a new ceasefire proposal from the US and Saudi Arabia but has not yet responded.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 01:24 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/94XT4WE)\n\n**What Is the Extent of Sudan's Humanitarian Crisis? | Council on Foreign Relations**\nSudan has been embroiled in a civil war since April 15, 2023, between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF), escalating an already dire humanitarian crisis. The conflict, which followed a breakdown of a fragile peace after the 2019 ousting of dictator Omar al-Bashir and a 2021 coup, has led to the world\u2019s largest and fastest-growing internal displacement crisis. As of November 2025, nearly 12 million people have been forcibly displaced\u20147.2 million internally and over 4.2 million as refugees or returnees. The RSF\u2019s capture of El Fasher in October 2025 marked the consolidation of control over Darfur and triggered mass civilian flight, with reports of mass killings and ethnic violence, particularly against the Masalit people. The UN and rights groups have described the violence in Darfur as genocide. The conflict has destroyed critical infrastructure, including hospitals, schools, and prisons, and caused outbreaks of cholera, dengue, and malaria. Over 25 million people now face acute hunger, with two regions confirmed in famine and 20 others at risk. The World Food Program warns Sudan could become the world\u2019s largest hunger crisis in recent history without a ceasefire. The United States designated the RSF\u2019s actions as genocide in January 2025 and sanctioned RSF leader Hemedti and seven UAE-based companies. Despite a November 2025 humanitarian ceasefire proposal backed by the U.S. and Arab nations, the SAF did not respond. International peace efforts\u2014including U.S.-Saudi, African Union, and regional initiatives\u2014have repeatedly failed. The Sudanese government suspended its membership in the Intergovernmental Authority on Development in 2024 and restricted media access. Foreign influence is a growing concern: Egypt supports the SAF, Russia-backed Khalifa Haftar supplies the RSF, and the UAE has been accused of arms deliveries (denied by Abu Dhabi). Russia reportedly secured a naval base deal on Sudan\u2019s Red Sea coast. The conflict threatens regional stability, including Nile River water cooperation and oil pipelines. Neighboring countries\u2014Chad, South Sudan, Egypt, Ethiopia, Libya, Uganda, and the Central African Republic\u2014are overwhelmed, with Chad reopening the Adr\u00e9 border in 2024 to aid delivery. UN humanitarian operations have been scaled back due to insecurity, and the 2025 appeal for $4.2 billion is only 28% funded. The funding shortfall, worsened by U.S. aid cuts under the Trump administration, has been labeled a 'crisis of responsibility' by UN chief Filippo Grandi, who warned the cost of inaction will be measured in lives and instability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 11:01 AM\nSource:[Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/articles/what-extent-sudans-humanitarian-crisis)\n\n**The Forgotten War in Sudan | Council on Foreign Relations**\nThe Council on Foreign Relations (CFR) published an analysis by President Mike Froman on the ongoing civil war in Sudan, highlighting its status as one of the worst humanitarian crises of the 21st century. The conflict, which began in April 2023, has resulted in over 150,000 deaths, widespread famine affecting more than 21 million people, and the siege and capture of El Fasher after an 18-month assault. Satellite imagery and detailed reporting confirm mass killings, siege-induced starvation, and evidence of genocide. Despite a recent U.S.-backed ceasefire proposal accepted by the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), both sides have a history of violating agreements, and no serious commitment to peace has been demonstrated. The war stems from a power struggle between the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the RSF, former allies under Omar al-Bashir\u2019s regime, which erupted after the military coup in 2021. External actors such as Egypt, Iran, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Russia, and Turkey are backing the SAF or RSF, driven by strategic interests including control of the Nile, access to the Red Sea, and regional influence. The humanitarian crisis has displaced over 12 million people and destabilized neighboring countries like South Sudan, Chad, and Somalia. CFR expert Michelle Gavin argues that the U.S. and international community have failed to act decisively due to global fatigue, regional inaction, and lack of leverage. She warns that allowing the conflict to continue undermines international law and enables terrorist networks to exploit a power vacuum. The article concludes by emphasizing that a stable, democratic Sudan could serve as a bridge between Arab and African nations and that the world\u2019s failure to act reflects a broader moral and strategic risk.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 11:01 AM\nSource:[Council on Foreign Relations](https://www.cfr.org/articles/forgotten-war-sudan)\n\n**'Stop the War': UN and IOC Urge Ceasefire During 2026 Milan Winter Olympics, But No Response Yet**\nThe United Nations (UN) and the International Olympic Committee (IOC) have jointly called for a cessation of hostilities during the 2026 Milan-Cortina d'Ampezzo Winter Olympics, urging all warring parties to observe a temporary truce. According to the 'Washington Post', this appeal, rooted in the ancient Olympic tradition of 'Ekecheiria'\u2014a sacred truce dating back to 776 BCE\u2014aims to ensure the safety of athletes and officials and uphold the Olympic Games as a global festival of peace. The UN and IOC issued a ceasefire resolution on February 3, 2026, calling for a 52-day truce from one week before the Olympics to one week after the Paralympics. However, as of the publication date, no conflict parties\u2014including those involved in the Gaza conflict, the Sudanese civil war, and the ongoing war in Ukraine\u2014have responded with any formal ceasefire plans. The 2026 Winter Olympics, to be held in Milan and Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy, will feature over 3,500 athletes from 93 nations. Russia is barred from participating under its national name due to its invasion of Ukraine; however, 13 Russian athletes are allowed to compete as Individual Neutral Athletes, without national symbols, and their medals will not count toward Russia's official records. Israel will send 9 athletes across multiple disciplines, while Palestine has no participants. The appeal remains unheeded, with ongoing violence persisting in key regions.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 09:51 AM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/sports/11951820)\n\n**UK Prioritizes Ukraine, Sudan, and Gaza During UN Security Council Presidency**\nThe United Kingdom has announced that the conflicts in Ukraine, Sudan, and Gaza will be top priorities during its presidency of the United Nations Security Council in February 2026, describing them as 'the gravest threats to international peace and security.' At a press conference in New York, UK diplomat James Kariuki stated that peace in Ukraine is 'closer than ever' and affirmed the UK's 'unwavering support' for Ukraine, both in peace efforts and in deterring further Russian aggression. The UK plans to host a Security Council meeting on Ukraine on February 24 to mark the fourth anniversary of Russia\u2019s large-scale invasion, with UK Minister of State for Europe Stephen Doughty presiding. On Sudan, Kariuki emphasized the urgent humanitarian crisis and pledged to use all diplomatic tools to push for a ceasefire, highlighting the February 19 meeting as a platform to address civilian protection, the catastrophic fighting, and the severe violence against women and girls, to be presided over by UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper. Regarding Gaza, the UK reiterated support for the US 20-point peace plan, calling for renewed momentum to sustain a ceasefire, disarm Hamas, and advance the Palestinian National Authority for Gaza administration, placing Palestinians at the center of recovery and reconstruction. The UK also stressed the need for urgent humanitarian aid, demanding full opening of borders for large-scale delivery of vital supplies. A February 19 meeting on Gaza will focus on implementing the peace plan, the deteriorating humanitarian situation, and the crisis in the West Bank, also presided over by Yvette Cooper. The UK will use its presidency to amplify civil society voices, particularly on human rights and the global epidemic of violence against women and girls, including sexual violence as a weapon of war. Additional agenda items include the UN Secretary-General\u2019s biannual strategic report on ISIS in Iraq and the Levant, the annual meeting of UN Police Commissioners, and discussions on Syria, Yemen, Libya, the Central African Republic, and South Sudan.

Senior military commander Johnson Olony reportedly urged troops to 'spare no lives,' including civilians, in preparation for a government offensive in Jonglei state, prompting condemnation from UNMISS and human rights groups. Renewed clashes have displaced 180,000 people, and violence persists in areas previously controlled by opposition forces. Machar, detained and accused of orchestrating a 2025 attack that killed 250 soldiers and a general, is under house arrest and cut off from his troops, weakening opposition leadership. Meanwhile, President Kiir has sidelined senior officials and dismantled key institutions, including sacking his intelligence chief in late 2025. The 2020 unity government remains paralyzed by rivalry, and Machar\u2019s party is excluded from the government\u2019s December 2026 election dialogue committee. Analysts like Tim Glawion of the Arnold Bergstraesser Institute warn that over three-quarters of the population face extreme distress due to hunger, flooding, and war, calling South Sudan one of the world\u2019s worst humanitarian crises\u2014alongside Sudan and Gaza. Despite a UN peacekeeping mission of nearly 20,000 troops, the mission is deemed weak due to the heavily armed government and opposition forces. Glawion stresses that lasting peace requires international pressure to force all warlords to step down and establish a civilian transitional government capable of organizing elections and humanitarian aid. Regional entanglements are worsening the crisis: Uganda, a long-time ally of Kiir, has allegedly violated the UN arms embargo by sending troops and equipment into South Sudan in December 2025. The conflict is further fueled by dependence on Sudanese ports for oil exports, linking South Sudan\u2019s instability to the ongoing war in Sudan since April 2023. Ulrich Thum of the Friedrich Ebert Foundation warns that the 2018 peace agreement is endangered, trust among signatories has collapsed, and there is no genuine political will to hold free elections under a permanent constitution. The country remains trapped in a cycle of militarization, with political offices dominated by former militia leaders and civilian voices excluded from governance 15 years after independence and 20 years after autonomy in 2005.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 03:56 PM\nSource:[Deutsche Welle](https://www.dw.com/en/at-the-brink-can-south-sudan-avert-another-civil-war/a-75769274)\n\n**Sudan\u2019s Prime Minister Announces Government Return to Khartoum, Declares 2026 as 'Year of Peace' and Promises Service Improvements**\nSudanese Prime Minister Kamil Idris announced the official return of the government to Khartoum after approximately three years, during which it operated from a temporary base in Port Sudan. Speaking at a large public gathering in Khartoum, Idris declared 2026 as the 'Year of Peace' in line with the government's National Peace Initiative, stating, 'We announce victory in these battles and the sustainability of development.' He emphasized that the peace sought is 'the peace of the brave, chosen by the people of Sudan, especially since war has been imposed upon them.' Idris pledged to improve essential services in health, education, electricity, and to rehabilitate and rebuild hospitals, schools, and universities across all states. He projected a 70% reduction in inflation, a 10% growth in GDP, and stable exchange rates for the current fiscal year, with no new taxes on citizens. Over recent weeks, several ministries have resumed operations in their main offices in central Khartoum. The government relocated to Port Sudan in April 2023 following the outbreak of war between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces. Meanwhile, Sudanese Foreign Minister Muhieddin Salim stressed the need for regional and international cooperation to achieve a humanitarian truce and a comprehensive ceasefire during a meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdel Atty in Jeddah, Saudi Arabia. The two countries reaffirmed their shared stance as Nile Basin states, opposing unilateral actions violating international law in the Eastern Nile Basin. Sudan also reiterated its firm support for the territorial integrity and unity of Somalia, condemning any attempts to undermine its sovereignty. A report by the Civilian Democratic Alliance 'Sudan's Resilience' revealed that 150,000 people have died since the war began, with 12 million internally displaced and 4.3 million refugees in neighboring countries. Additionally, 5 million children are displaced, and 30 million Sudanese\u2014over half the population\u2014require urgent humanitarian aid. The UN warned of a potential 50% collapse in humanitarian funding, which would reduce food rations, and highlighted ongoing bureaucratic and security barriers to aid access. The alliance called for the implementation of the Quad's truce roadmap, the appointment of a regional humanitarian coordinator under UN supervision, and urged the international community not to legitimize any warring party, warning that humanitarian aid should not be politicized. In October 2025, the alliance proposed a three-track political process beginning with humanitarian relief and a ceasefire, followed by political dialogue to address the root causes of the conflict.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 11, 2026 06:24 PM\nSource:[SudaNile](https://sudanile.com/%D8%B1%D8%A6%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%86-%D8%B9%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A9-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%AD%D9%83%D9%88%D9%85%D8%A9-%D8%A5/)\n\n**2026: A Year of Stalled Conflicts and Imposed Settlements**\nThe year 2026 is anticipated as a pivotal yet unresolved period in global conflict dynamics, marked by persistent and unresolved crises rather than decisive breakthroughs. Key flashpoints include the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, particularly in Gaza, where diplomatic efforts have failed to achieve meaningful progress despite international mediation; violence remains high, with projections indicating some of the world\u2019s highest conflict-related fatalities. In Sudan, the ongoing civil war since 2023 has created the world\u2019s largest humanitarian crisis for three consecutive years, with no near-term resolution expected due to deep internal divisions and reliance on external support. In Ukraine, the war with Russia continues in a strategic stalemate, with Western support for Kyiv and Russian resistance to concessions making a comprehensive peace unlikely in 2026. Analysts expect continued military deadlock, political stagnation, and civilian suffering. In Venezuela, a deep political and economic crisis persists, with U.S. pressure increasing but direct military intervention deemed highly improbable due to regional backlash, high costs, and global reputational risks. In Southeast Asia, the Cambodia-Thailand border conflict has escalated since mid-2025, causing mass displacement and a refugee crisis; regional diplomacy, especially from ASEAN and China, is actively seeking de-escalation, with 2026 seen as a potential turning point for either a ceasefire or sustained low-level conflict. Experts, including former Egyptian diplomat Hussein Hreidi and international relations scholar Dr. Mohamed Rabie al-Dahi, emphasize that the root causes of conflict\u2014political, historical, religious, and security-related\u2014are deeply entrenched, making rapid solutions improbable. They stress that the real test lies in whether warring parties are willing to bear the costs of peace. While some temporary truces may hold, long-term stability remains elusive. Analysts like political scientist Ahmed Mohamed al-Masri predict that 2026 will not bring 'happy endings' but rather 'imposed settlements' in some regions and 'forgotten attrition' in others, with conflict endurance tied to the parties\u2019 ability to sustain war or peace. The year is thus characterized as one of managed crises, not resolution.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 31, 2025 08:55 AM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0628\u064a\u0627\u0646](https://www.albayan.ae/news/world/us/998431)\n\n**More Peace in 2026: Can the World Hope for It?**\nThe article examines the prospects for peace in 2026, reflecting on the year 2025, which was marked by numerous conflicts and extensive peace negotiations. Despite high-level talks between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and former U.S. President Donald Trump, no concrete outcomes were achieved. The article notes that while temporary truces were established in Gaza, India-Pakistan, and Thailand-Cambodia, these were short-term measures lacking lasting solutions. According to the International Rescue Committee's Emergency Watchlist 2026, the Sudan remains the most critical crisis, with approximately 150,000 civilian deaths and 12 million displaced, facing extreme violence, hunger, and disease. The Palestinian territories rank second, with dire living conditions in Gaza even under full ceasefire, and the South Sudan ranks third, nearing renewed civil war due to unfulfilled peace agreement terms. The article argues that true peace in 2026 is unlikely due to conflicting global interests and a shifting international order, with power moving from the West to the East and South, increasing tensions. The nature of war has evolved: from formal declarations between states to protracted, low-intensity conflicts involving non-state actors, such as civil wars, terrorism, and drug wars, making resolution more complex and prolonged. The article concludes that the world is in a transitional phase since around 2007, and future years are expected to remain conflict-prone.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 29, 2025 03:35 PM\nSource:[SRF News](https://www.srf.ch/news/international/ausblick-ins-neue-jahr-darf-die-welt-2026-auf-mehr-frieden-hoffen)\n\n**Sudan's Economic Dawn: Can Peace Unlock a Recovery After War?**\nA report from the International Monetary Fund (IMF) offers cautious optimism about Sudan's economic future, suggesting a potential significant recovery starting in 2026, contingent on the cessation of the ongoing conflict. The IMF maintains its forecast of a 23.4% economic contraction in 2024, reflecting the severe damage, displacement, and halted production. However, it revised its projection for 2026 to a 9.5% economic growth rate\u2014among the highest in the region\u2014and expects inflation to decline from 87.2% in 2024 to 54.6% in 2025 and 16.1% in 2026. This projected recovery is described as 'compensatory growth' dependent on a single condition: the end of the war by the end of 2025 and a short-term ceasefire to begin reconstruction. The IMF attributes Sudan's potential for rapid recovery to its economic resilience, particularly its large agricultural sector, which employs about 80% of the workforce and contributes significantly to GDP, and its underutilized natural resources. Rebuilding infrastructure, including roads, bridges, hospitals, and schools, and restarting major projects like the Gezira Scheme, are expected to drive growth and create jobs. The article notes that the IMF's estimates are based on expert judgment rather than updated official data, as Sudan has not released updated economic statistics since 2019 and its statistical system has not been modernized since the 1980s. The author emphasizes that the IMF's projections are not guarantees but a roadmap contingent on peace, stating that 'peace is the only currency that can buy Sudan this promised economic dawn.' Without peace, the forecasts remain theoretical.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 27, 2025 11:22 AM\nSource:[SudaNile](https://sudanile.com/%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%87%D9%84-%D9%8A%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%82-%D9%81%D8%AC%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%AA%D8%B5%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A-%D8%AC%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%AD/)\n\n**AI model warns of deadliest conflict zones in 2026**\nThe Violence and Impacts Early-Warning System (VIEWS), an AI-driven conflict forecasting model developed by the Peace Research Institute Oslo (PRIO) and Uppsala University, projects that Ukraine, Palestine/Israel, Sudan, Pakistan, and Nigeria will experience the highest battle-related death tolls in 2026. The model's central estimate (main mean) forecasts 28,300 deaths in Ukraine, 7,700 in Palestine/Israel, 4,300 in Sudan, 2,000 in Pakistan, and 1,900 in Nigeria. These projections are based on machine-learning techniques and extensive datasets including historical violence, socioeconomic indicators, climate conditions, geography, and political institutions. The forecast for Palestine/Israel reflects a projected decline from the approximately 14,000 state-based conflict deaths recorded by the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) between January and October 2025, partly due to the Gaza ceasefire agreed in October 2025. Similarly, Ukraine\u2019s 2026 projection is below the 59,600 deaths recorded in 2025 to date, though the model acknowledges the possibility of conflict resolution in 2026. Sudan\u2019s projected death toll has more than doubled in the past month, rising from earlier estimates, signaling a rapid deterioration in the security situation. The model\u2019s track record includes correctly identifying seven of the ten deadliest countries in 2024 and six of the top ten in 2023. H\u00e5vard Hegre, PRIO Research Professor and lead of the VIEWS team, emphasized that the forecasts are best-estimate scenarios, not certainties, and can guide governments, the UN, and aid organizations in early planning. He issued a 'clear warning bell' for Sudan, noting the situation may worsen significantly. The model\u2019s predictions are designed to help prioritize resources and attention in high-risk regions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 11, 2025 09:29 AM\nSource:[ReliefWeb](https://reliefweb.int/report/world/ai-model-warns-deadliest-conflict-zones-2026)\n\n**Sudan's Civil War Worsens as Government Forces Reject Trump's Ceasefire Proposal**\nThe conflict in Sudan, which has been ongoing since April 2023, continues to deteriorate, with over 150,000 people killed. Recent reports indicate large-scale civilian massacres occurring at hospitals, particularly after the rebel group Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized El Fasher, a key government stronghold in western Darfur, on October 26. Amid this escalation, Sudan's government forces rejected a ceasefire proposal from the U.S. Donald Trump administration on November 4, 2025. Regional powers including Russia, Egypt, T\u00fcrkiye, Iran, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) are supporting either the government or the rebels based on their strategic interests, leading to widespread predictions that the conflict will continue to intensify.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 07:05 AM\nSource:[www.donga.com](https://www.donga.com/news/Inter/article/all/20251105/132707512/1)\n\n**Sudan's prime minister urges ceasefire roadmap at UNGA**\nAt the United Nations General Assembly, Sudan's Prime Minister Kamil Idris reaffirmed the government\u2019s commitment to a peace roadmap for the civil war.

Idris urged the international community to enforce Security Council Resolution\u202f2736, warning of catastrophic human consequences if inaction continues. He said, 'We affirm from this podium, the commitment of the government of Sudan to the road map... Children are dying. Women are dying, the elderly are dying because of starvation. And the international community is silent.' The conflict, which began in April\u202f2023, has killed at least 40,000 people and displaced about 12\u202fmillion, according to the UN. Both the military and Rapid Support Forces have been accused of atrocities, and civilians face famine and lack basic services.

He cited the 15\u202fApril\u202f2023 start of hostilities and the rapid early gains of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) in Khartoum, the Blue Nile, and South Kordofan, only to see the Sudanese army regain control in mid\u20112024.  The RSF has been besieging Al\u2011Fashir for more than 500\u202fdays, turning the city into a famine zone where children die daily from malnutrition and water\u2011borne disease.  Baldou said the RSF\u2019s attacks on civilian targets\u2014including markets in Darfur and Kordofan\u2014have turned livelihoods into military objectives, a \"tragic and lamentable\" reality.\n\nHe highlighted the fragmentation of power: four competing administrative zones\u2014Port Sudan, Nyala, Jabal Marra, and the Nuba Hills\u2014are each governed by rival militias, while two parallel governments (the \"Establishment\" in Nyala and the \"De facto\" government in Port Sudan) operate under the military\u2019s shadow.  The United Nations has refused to recognise either, and the international community has largely ignored Sudan\u2019s plight.\n\nBaldou urged an immediate ceasefire and humanitarian delivery, stressing that the civil society must unify its message to the world.  He warned against relying solely on the U.S.\u2011led quadrilateral initiative, noting that Egypt and the UAE continue to support opposing sides, undermining any diplomatic effort.  He concluded that the only way to end the war is through a genuine political will from both the Sudanese army and the RSF, and that civil society must demand a ceasefire and aid.\n\nKey metrics: 13\u202fmillion people face famine; Al\u2011Fashir has been under siege for 500\u202fdays; the war began on 15\u202fApril\u202f2023; the RSF controlled Khartoum and surrounding states in the first year but lost them in mid\u20112024.\n\nQuotes: 'The war has destroyed all aspects of life and turned the entire population into refugees and displaced persons.'; 'The siege of Al\u2011Fashir has turned the city into a famine zone where children die daily from malnutrition and water\u2011borne disease.'; 'The civil society must unify its message to the world to demand a ceasefire and humanitarian aid.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 08, 2025 08:06 AM\nSource:[alsudantoday.com](https://alsudantoday.com/sudan-news/sudan-now-news/469703)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
