It only shows crowd sentiment on a different prediction platform (Manifold vs. Metaculus).\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://themedialine.org/mideast-daily-news/egypt-and-saudi-arabia-urge-diplomacy-as-gaza-talks-and-sudan-war-intensify/\">\n# Summary of Article: Egypt and Saudi Arabia Urge Diplomacy as Gaza Talks and Sudan War Intensify\n\n**Date:** February 01, 2026  \n**Source:** The Media Line  \n**Author:** Steven Ganot\n\n## Key Facts and Statements:\n\n### Diplomatic Activity:\n- Egyptian Foreign Minister Badr Abdelatty and Saudi Foreign Minister Faisal bin Farhan Al Saud held a phone call on Saturday\n- Both ministers emphasized \"prioritizing political and negotiated solutions, while rejecting the logic of escalation and the use of force\" (according to Egypt's Foreign Ministry)\n\n### Sudan-Specific Content:\n- The ministers discussed Sudan as a \"major flashpoint\" alongside Gaza\n- Fighting between the Sudanese army and the Rapid Support Forces described as creating \"one of the world's worst humanitarian disasters\"\n- The conflict has displaced millions and left cities shattered\n- **The ministers called for \"a humanitarian truce as a prelude to a comprehensive ceasefire and the launch of an inclusive political process\"**\n- They urged the establishment of safe corridors for civilians\n- Reference made to \"massacres and grave atrocities\" reported in El-Fasher\n\n### Gaza Context (for completeness):\n- Gaza ceasefire process discussed as \"fragile\"\n- Gaza health authorities report over 71,000 Palestinians killed and over 171,000 wounded since October 2023\n- A truce was brokered through mediation by Egypt, Qatar, Turkey, and the United States\n\n## Relevance to Forecasting Question:\nThis article indicates ongoing diplomatic efforts by regional powers (Egypt and Saudi Arabia) calling for a humanitarian truce leading to a comprehensive ceasefire in Sudan, suggesting international attention to the conflict but no concrete ceasefire agreement as of February 1, 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://allafrica.com/stories/202602030608.html\">\n# Summary: Sudan Intelligence Meeting in Washington\n\n## Key Facts and Events\n\n**Meeting Details:**\n- Sudan's Armed Forces (SAF)-aligned government intelligence director, Gen. Ahmed Mufaddal, held meetings in Washington, DC in January 2026 with members of the US intelligence community\n- The meetings were kept deliberately low-profile and were not publicly announced\n- **Notably, ceasefire discussions were NOT included in the talks**\n\n**Meeting Focus:**\n- Discussions were narrowly framed around \"mutual security files\" including:\n  - Counterterrorism cooperation\n  - Intelligence sharing related to extremist networks\n  - US concerns about Sudan's ties with Iran\n- Meetings were described as \"technical in nature\" and limited to security priorities rather than political negotiations or broader diplomatic engagement\n\n## Expert Opinions (Named Sources)\n\n**Hamid Khalafallah** (Sudanese researcher familiar with the meeting):\n- Characterized the engagement as \"short-term tactical engagement that is very circumstantial\"\n- Described it as \"the US lecturing the government in Port Sudan on how to behave\" rather than genuine dialogue\n- Noted that SAF's support comes primarily from Islamist networks and Iranian links: \"These are the only ways they've gotten support so far \u2013 fighters on the ground, access to money, access to weapons\"\n- Argued that distancing from these supporters would be \"quite tough\" for Port Sudan\n- Linked timing to regional developments involving Iran and Israeli security concerns\n\n**Cameron Hudson** (US-Africa policy expert):\n- Framed the engagement pragmatically: \"This isn't about building trust. It's about advancing interests that both sides have\"\n- Noted that \"Washington has said that its top priority in all of Africa is counterterrorism\"\n- Stated \"My understanding is that is what was agreed\" regarding assurances on counterterrorism cooperation\n\n## Context on Sudan's Alliances\n- Port Sudan government faces scrutiny over reported military and logistical ties with Iran\n- SAF relies on Islamist networks for manpower, financing, and weapons access\n- Regional rivalries (particularly UAE narratives against SAF) complicate Port Sudan's diplomatic positioning\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/1/trilateral-ukraine-talks-set-to-resume-in-abu-dhabi-on-wednesday-zelenskyy\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Trilateral Ukraine talks to resume in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday: Zelenskyy\"\n\n**Source:** Al Jazeera  \n**Date Context:** Published Sunday (appears to be early February 2025 based on context)\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n1. **Trilateral Talks Schedule:** Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy announced that envoys from the United States, Russia, and Ukraine will meet in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday and Thursday for a second round of negotiations.\n\n2. **Previous Talks:** The first round of trilateral negotiations took place in late January but made little progress on territorial questions.\n\n3. **Territorial Dispute:** Moscow is demanding Kyiv cede a fifth of the Donetsk region that Ukraine still controls; Zelenskyy's government is refusing.\n\n4. **Energy Ceasefire Status:** \n   - US President Donald Trump announced on Thursday that Russian President Vladimir Putin agreed to stop strikes on energy targets for a week due to cold weather\n   - The Kremlin said Friday it agreed to halt strikes on energy infrastructure until Sunday\n   - Ukraine believed the suspension was supposed to last until the following Friday\n   - Terms of the agreement were not clear\n\n5. **Recent Diplomatic Activity:** US envoy Steve Witkoff held talks with Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev in Florida on Saturday, with other US officials present.\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n- **Volodymyr Zelenskyy:** \"Ukraine is ready for a substantive discussion, and we are interested in ensuring that the outcome brings us closer to a real and dignified end to the war\"\n\n- **Steve Witkoff (US envoy):** Said he was \"encouraged by this meeting that Russia is working toward securing peace in Ukraine\"\n\n- **Dmitry Medvedev (former Russian President, now deputy chairman of Russia's Security Council):** Praised Trump as a \"peacemaker\" and told Reuters that Russia would \"soon\" achieve a military victory in Ukraine, adding \"But it is equally important to think about what will happen next. After all, the goal of victory is to prevent new conflicts.\"\n\n**Note:** This article concerns the Ukraine-Russia conflict, not the Sudanese Civil War that is the subject of the underlying Metaculus question.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve full time-series data for Metaculus question 41144; list major probability moves since 2025-12-01 with associated news headlines; summarize trend in last two weeks.\nA fresh round of targeted searches again failed to surface any public trace\u2014HTML, JSON, cached copy, forum citation, GitHub data file, screenshot, or secondary commentary\u2014of Metaculus question #41144.\n\n1. Google\u2019s web index still returns zero hits on the literal identifier. Both broad keyword probes such as \u201cMetaculus question 41144\u201d and structured API-style strings like \u201csite:metaculus.com/api2 41144\u201d produced the message \u201cNo usable content extracted,\u201d i.e., an empty result set (Google search results above). The same null outcome recurred for alternative phrasings such as \u201cMetaculus 41144 probability jump news\u201d and \u201cMetaculus screenshot 41144 png.\u201d\n\n2. GitHub repositories that mirror the full public Metaculus catalogue likewise contain no reference to 41144. The Metaculus-maintained \u201cforecasting-tools\u201d repository\u2014whose API wrapper automatically sweeps every accessible question\u2014shows no filenames or commit diffs that include the number 41144 (GitHub result: Metaculus/forecasting-tools). Third-party datasets used in academic analyses of Metaculus data (e.g., Rethink Priorities\u2019 study of resolved AI questions) do not list the ID either.\n\n3. Wider web discussion remains silent. Reddit, EA Forum, LessWrong, and other forecast-oriented communities commonly cite question IDs when debating interesting markets, yet no posts surfaced that include \u201c41144\u201d in conjunction with \u201cMetaculus.\u201d The search term \u201cMetaculus unpublished question leak,\u201d designed to pick up any disclosure of private or deleted items, returned no relevant pages.\n\n4. Absence from the Internet Archive continues. Although not re-queried in this batch, earlier CDX checks against both the HTML page URL and the JSON timeline endpoint for 41144 yielded no snapshots\u2014a strong indication that web crawlers never saw the resource.\n\nSynthesis of current evidence\n\u2022 Every public-facing channel that normally exposes Metaculus data remains empty, suggesting that question #41144 has never been publicly crawlable.  \n\u2022 The most plausible explanations are: (a) the item resides in \u201cprivate research\u201d mode, visible only to invited accounts; (b) it is confined to a gated tournament interface that masks regular URLs and API endpoints; or (c) it has been hard-deleted from production databases.\n\nImpact on the original deliverables\nThe user\u2019s requested outputs\u2014(i) full time-series data, (ii) a chronology of major probability swings since 2025-12-01 with accompanying news headlines, and (iii) a two-week trend synopsis\u2014all presuppose access to at least the timeline JSON or a front-end chart. No such data can be collected externally; therefore none of the deliverables can be generated in an evidence-based manner.\n\nRemaining information gaps that prevent completion\n1. Authoritative confirmation from Metaculus staff (or from organizers of any private tournament) of the question\u2019s visibility status.  \n2. Any artefact\u2014screenshot, PDF export, user note\u2014that contains a single probability value or even the title of question #41144. Such a clue could enable indirect reconstruction of the timeline via community estimates or press coverage.  \n3. If the question is tournament-restricted, the tournament slug or name; with that, authenticated API calls might be feasible.\n\nWithout at least one of these pieces, further open-source research is unlikely to break the impasse.\n\nConclusion\nAll available search outputs converge on the assessment that Metaculus question #41144 is not publicly accessible. Consequently, the time-series data, probability-move log, and recent trend analysis requested in the original query cannot be produced at this time. Additional, non-public information\u2014most plausibly direct confirmation or data release from Metaculus\u2014is required to proceed.</Agent_report>\n"
