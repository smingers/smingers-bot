## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Feb 3-4 selloff**: Multiple independent sources (China.com, Asianet, Stockpulse) confirm Nvidia dropped 2.84-4% on Feb 3, 2026, with market cap loss of $128B. This is a **recent negative catalyst** that could elevate crash probability in Metaculus community's mind.
- **Current stock price ~$180-186**: Well above $100 threshold (46-53% drop required). Structural barrier to reaching $100.
- **Earnings on Feb 25**: After the Feb 12 resolution date. No major scheduled catalyst before resolution.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Analyst consensus remains bullish**: Strong buy ratings (58/63), price targets $220-$240s suggest professional forecasters see low crash risk.
- **Tech sector rotation**: Feb 3 saw broad tech selloff, rotation to gold/silver. Could temporarily elevate perceived risk.
- **AI competition concerns**: Anthropic tool launch triggered software stock panic, raising questions about AI sustainability.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **AI model predictions** ($190.75 average): Speculative, not based on fundamental analysis.
- **Historical bullish articles**: Pre-date recent selloff, less relevant to current sentiment.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 8 days (Feb 4 → Feb 12, 2026)

The target Metaculus question asks: "Will Nvidia close below $100 **on any day in 2026**?" This requires a ~47% crash from current $186-190 levels.

**Current Metaculus community forecast**: Unknown, but likely in 5-15% range based on:
- Objective base rate (~10% for mega-cap 50% crashes)
- Recent selloff might temporarily elevate it toward 12-15%

**If timeframe halved (4 days)**: Probability would decrease to ~25-30% - insufficient time for forecast to drift meaningfully without major catalyst.

**If timeframe doubled (16 days)**: Probability would increase to ~50-55% - more time for news flow and forecast updates, especially if Feb 3 selloff continues.

## (d) Justification

**Key factors shifting from 40% outside view base rate:**

1. **Recent negative catalyst (Feb 3 selloff)**: The 2.84-4% drop with $128B market cap loss is fresh news that Metaculus forecasters will incorporate. This could temporarily push the community forecast toward the higher end of the natural 8-15% range. **Moderate upward pressure (+5-10 pp).**

2. **No imminent catalyst before Feb 12**: Earnings are Feb 25. Without a scheduled event, forecasts typically show low volatility over 8-day windows. Historical drift data suggests only 14% chance of crossing 15% threshold if currently below it. **Strong downward pressure (-10 pp).**

3. **Structural price barrier**: At $180-186, Nvidia needs to fall 46-53% to hit $100. This is an extreme tail event. Even pessimistic analysts (Seaport's $140 target) don't approach $100. The Metaculus community, being well-calibrated, likely assigns this <15% probability. **Moderate downward pressure (-5 pp).**

4. **Tech rotation context**: The Feb 3 selloff was part of broader tech rotation (software stocks down 10-20%), not Nvidia-specific fundamental deterioration. Jensen Huang clarified OpenAI investment concerns. This limits how much the selloff should rationally elevate crash probability. **Slight downward pressure (-3 pp).**

**Net adjustment**: +5-10 (recent selloff) -10 (no catalyst) -5 (structural barrier) -3 (context) = **-13 to -3 pp from 40% base → 27-37% range**

**Most likely scenario**: The Metaculus community forecast is currently 10-13% (elevated from ~8-10% baseline due to Feb 3 selloff). Over the next 8 days, absent major news, it drifts modestly but remains below 15%. Probability it crosses 15% threshold: **30-35%**.

## Probability Calibration

Given:
- p₀ (already >15% today) = 0.20 (lower than outside view's 0.30, because Feb 3 selloff is not severe enough to push well-calibrated forecasters above 15%)
- p₁ (crosses 15% in next 8 days | currently ≤15%) = 0.12 (slightly lower than 0.14 base, due to lack of catalyst)

**P(Yes) = 0.20 + (0.80 × 0.12) = 0.20 + 0.096 = 0.296 ≈ 30%**

Sensitivity check:
- If p₀ = 0.25, p₁ = 0.15: P(Yes) = 36%
- If p₀ = 0.15, p₁ = 0.10: P(Yes) = 24%

Central estimate: **30-32%**

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Metaculus community forecast for "Nvidia <$100 in 2026" exceed 15% on Feb 12, 2026? (8 days from now)

2. **Base rate**: 40% from outside view (combining 30% already-above + 70%×14% drift probability). Current analysis reduces this to 30% due to recent selloff being insufficient to push forecast >15% and lack of catalyst.

3. **Consistency**: "30 out of 100 times, the Metaculus community forecast exceeds 15% on Feb 12." This aligns with: recent modest selloff elevating risk perception slightly, but 8-day window with no catalyst limiting drift.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Feb 3: Nvidia fell 2.84%, $128B market cap loss (factual, very recent)
   - Current price $180-186, requiring 47% crash to hit $100 (factual)
   - Earnings Feb 25, after resolution date (factual)
   - Analyst consensus: 58/63 buy ratings, targets $220-240s (factual)
   - Historical 8-day drift: 14% chance of crossing threshold (statistical)

5. **Blind spot**: Unexpected regulatory action (e.g., emergency export ban to major customer) or accounting scandal emerges Feb 5-11, causing Metaculus forecasters to rapidly update crash probability >15%. This would make my 30% look too low. Probability of this scenario: ~5-8%.

6. **Status quo**: Current Metaculus forecast likely 10-13%. Status quo (no major news) → forecast stays roughly flat → remains <15%. This favors "No" outcome, supporting my 30% (vs. 50%+ if high volatility expected).

**Probability: 32%**
