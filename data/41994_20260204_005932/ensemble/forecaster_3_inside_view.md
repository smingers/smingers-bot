Analysis:
### 1) Restating the question / resolution logic (avoid bait-and-switch)
We resolve **Yes** iff, on **2026-02-12 18:14:01**, the **Metaculus community prediction** for: “Will Nvidia’s stock price close below $100 on any day in 2026?” is **strictly > 15.00%**. Otherwise **No**.

### (a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; facts vs opinions)
**TechCrunch (Jan 28, 2026) – ASML orders / AI infra boom**
- **Quality/date:** Reputable tech outlet; recent.
- **Facts:** ASML record bookings (€13B), CEO says customers more positive about medium-term demand.
- **Opinion/interpretation:** “Boom shows no sign of slowing” is editorial framing.
- **Relevance:** Indirectly bullish for Nvidia demand backdrop.

**Techbuzz.ai (undated in prompt; references Oct 28 GTC) – Nvidia “$500B order book”**
- **Quality:** Lower/unclear; blog-like. Still cites a specific claimed Huang disclosure + named analysts.
- **Facts (if accurate):** $500B orders through 2026; revenue growth stats; upcoming earnings expectations.
- **Opinions:** Analysts (Caso, Schafer) bullish.
- **Relevance:** Supports “not a near-term collapse” narrative; may depress tail-risk probabilities.

**CNBC (Dec 2, 2025) – Memory shortages / component inflation**
- **Quality/date:** High; recent-ish.
- **Facts:** Memory price forecasts; supply constraints; quotes from Bain/Alibaba/Counterpoint/Dell.
- **Mechanism:** Cost pressures/bottlenecks can squeeze margins or slow shipments.
- **Relevance:** Mildly bearish (execution/margin risk), but not a direct “>$100 to <$100” driver alone.

**CNBC (Sep 8, 2025) – Citi trims target; competition**
- **Quality/date:** High; older but still relevant.
- **Facts:** Citi target cut to $200; customer concentration stats; competition concerns.
- **Relevance:** Supports plausible downside narratives that a forecasting crowd might price as tail risk.

**Motley Fool / Nasdaq reprints (Sep/Oct/Nov 2025; Jan/Feb 2026) – bullish long-run pieces**
- **Quality/date:** Mixed; largely opinion/marketing; some include identifiable analysts (Evercore, Seaport).
- **Facts:** Often repeat widely-cited metrics (order backlog, capex trends).
- **Opinions:** Strongly bullish price targets and “soar” predictions.
- **Relevance:** These kinds of articles can buoy sentiment but are weak evidence for a *specific* drawdown threshold.

**AskNews (Feb 3–4, 2026) – market selloff / NVDA down ~3–5%**
- **Quality/date:** Mixed (some are smaller outlets / translated), but **very recent** and directionally consistent.
- **Facts:** Broad tech drawdown; Nvidia had a notable down day; “AI spending concerns resurface.”
- **Relevance:** Near-term volatility tends to **raise** perceived tail risk modestly.

**Stockpulse (Feb 3, 2026) – NVDA ~ $180; 52-week low $86.62 (Apr 7, 2025)**
- **Quality/date:** Mixed aggregator, but includes concrete price stats.
- **Facts:** Recent 52-week low **below $100** is a key anchor.
- **Relevance:** Strongly supports “below $100 is not unimaginable.”

**Yahoo Finance (Nov 28, 2025) – Polymarket ranges**
- **Quality/date:** Medium; market-implied probabilities can be informative but contract set differs.
- **Facts:** Polymarket pricing suggests low probability of extreme moves (as framed there).
- **Relevance:** Slightly bearish for “>15%” crowd probability (markets seem not to price big crash odds), but only weakly comparable.

### (b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution-relevant drivers)
We’re forecasting *what Metaculus will think by Feb 12*, not the true event probability—so the key drivers are: **current price level, salient recent volatility, and dominant narrative (AI boom vs bubble/crash), plus “split risk.”**

**Strong evidence (bigger shifts)**
1) **Recent realized price history includes sub-$100 (Apr 2025 low ~$86.6)** (Stockpulse stat; also in your outside-view writeup).  
   - This makes “<$100 sometime in 2026” a *salient tail event* that forecasters often keep nontrivial.
2) **Current price around ~$180–186** (multiple recent snippets).  
   - Implies needing roughly a **45%+ drawdown** (absent splits). That’s large, which pushes community probability down.

**Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)**
3) **Visible market volatility / AI spending anxiety (Feb 3 selloff; rotation talk)** (AskNews/Investopedia-style recap).  
   - This tends to nudge tail probabilities up a bit (salience of drawdowns).
4) **Supply-chain cost pressure (memory/HBM constraints)** (CNBC Dec 2025).  
   - Adds an execution/margin risk storyline that can support higher tail risk than “perfect glide path.”

**Weak evidence (small shifts)**
5) **Very bullish “soar after earnings”/long-term price targets** (Motley Fool-type).  
   - Often low signal; can shift vibes but not robust.
6) **ASML bookings / “AI boom continues”** (TechCrunch).  
   - Real, but indirect; helps the bullish baseline modestly.

**Special consideration: stock splits (important meta-point)**
- The target question is about **nominal price** closing below $100. A **2-for-1 split** at ~$180 would mechanically put the post-split price at ~$90, creating an easy path to “Yes” on the target question without a fundamental crash.  
- I have **no direct evidence** in the provided sources that a split is planned soon; still, sophisticated forecasters may assign some probability to a split over the year. This is a mild upward push toward >15% on Metaculus (because it creates a second pathway).

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Forecast horizon for this meta-question:** ~**8 days** (Feb 4 → Feb 12).  
- **Underlying target event horizon:** rest of **calendar 2026** (~10.3 months left on Feb 12).

How would my meta-forecast change if time were halved/doubled?
- If the meta horizon were **4 days**, I’d hew more tightly to **status quo** community levels (less time for sentiment-moving news) → slightly *lower* chance of crossing >15.
- If it were **16 days**, we get closer to **NVDA earnings (Feb 25)** and more market moves; that increases odds the community prediction swings meaningfully → slightly *higher* chance of crossing >15 (in either direction, but tail-risk spikes tend to be sharper).

### (d) Justification: updating the outside view (38%) to an inside view
**Outside view (given): 38%** that Metaculus community probability exceeds 15% on Feb 12.

Key updates since that baseline:
- **Bullish fundamental narrative remains dominant** in the information set (AI infra boom; order backlog; analyst consensus generally far above $100). This pushes *against* a high Metaculus tail probability.
- **But** the **recent sub-$100 precedent (Apr 2025)** plus **fresh tech volatility (Feb 3 drawdown)** keeps a nontrivial tail alive.
- Net: I think my outside-view 38% slightly **over-weights** the community’s willingness to sit above 15% when the stock is ~180 and the modal narrative is still “AI buildout continues.” I expect the community median will more likely sit around ~10–15% than clearly above 15%.

So I revise **down modestly**, not drastically (because the “it already happened once recently” anchor is powerful).

Probability calibration
- My inside-view estimate that the community prediction will be **>15%** on 2026-02-12 is **34%**.
- Sensitivity: a ±10% change is plausible if (i) NVDA has another sharp leg down before Feb 12, (ii) a credible split rumor emerges, or (iii) a broader tech correction accelerates.

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: On Feb 12, 2026 18:14:01, will Metaculus community put >15% on NVDA closing <$100 at least once in 2026?
2) Outside view base rate: 38% (given).
3) Consistency: **34 out of 100** times, the community prediction is **>15%** at the snapshot time.
4) Key evidence (most important):
   - NVDA recently traded below $100 in Apr 2025 (salient precedent).
   - Current NVDA price ~180 implies very large drawdown needed absent a split.
   - Recent Feb 3 tech selloff increases perceived tail risk a bit.
   - Continued AI-infra bullish signals (ASML bookings/order-backlog narrative) suppresses crash odds.
5) Blind spot: A widely-circulated **stock split** expectation (or announcement/rumor) could abruptly push Metaculus >15%.
6) Status quo: With no major shock in next 8 days, community likely stays near its existing level; I lean slightly toward “No” but not strongly.

Probability: 34%
