You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 15.00% on 2026-02-12 for the Metaculus question "Will Nvidia's stock price close below $100 on any day in 2026?"?

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40972) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-12 18:14:01 is higher than 15.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 15.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-12 18:14:01, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

# Summary: China Opens Door to Nvidia H200 Chips But Questions Outnumber Answers

**Source:** 24/7 Wall St., January 25, 2026, by William Temple

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **China Market Approval:** China has reportedly indicated willingness to approve NVIDIA H200 chips for import, with CEO Jensen Huang currently in Shanghai. However, significant uncertainty remains about whether this represents full H200 capability or a restricted version with performance caps, volume quotas, or end-use restrictions.

2. **Historical China Revenue:** China previously represented 20-30% of Nvidia's revenue share. According to CFO Colette Kress in the Q3 FY 2026 earnings call, China data center revenue grew sequentially on "export-compliant copper products," but "remains well below levels prior to the onset of export controls."

3. **Stock Performance:**
   - NVDA: up 0.77% over the past week
   - AMD: surged 12% over the same period
   - Nvidia's stock showed limited movement following the China approval news

4. **Valuation Metrics:**
   - AMD: trades at 41x forward earnings with 60% YoY earnings growth and a PEG ratio of 0.56
   - Nvidia: forward P/E stands at 25x

5. **Insider Selling Activity:**
   - CEO Huang sold 9.9 million shares between October and December 2025
   - CFO Kress sold over 200,000 shares in the same window, with concentrated selling in mid-December around the approval timeline
   - No executives purchased stock during this period

6. **Competitive Landscape:**
   - AMD's MI400 accelerators are shipping alongside Nvidia systems
   - Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan stated Intel was "caught off guard" by AI data center demand and cannot meet supply
   - China's domestic alternatives include Alibaba's T-Head and Baidu's Kunlunxin processors

## Analysis Context:

The article emphasizes uncertainty around the practical implications of China's approval, noting that questions remain about conditions, volume, and deployment restrictions. The market's muted response to the news and significant insider selling activity are highlighted as noteworthy factors.

<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve daily community prediction history for Metaculus question 40972 and summarize key Nvidia–semiconductor sector news Jan-Feb 2026 likely to influence probability.
A. Status of the “daily community-prediction history” for Metaculus question 40972  
1. The two canonical API endpoints—/api2/questions/40972/ and /api2/questions/40972/forecast_time_series/—still return HTTP 404 to an unauthenticated client. A fresh Google scan for public mirrors, CSV dumps or Wayback captures again produced no hits (see searches returned “No usable content extracted.”).  
2. GitHub repositories that periodically archive Metaculus data (e.g., nikosbosse/Metaculus-data-analyses and several historical gists) continue to stop at question IDs created before 2024. Question 40972 therefore remains absent from every open-source snapshot located so far.  
3. Because the question text and the JSON time-series are both inaccessible, it is still impossible to supply the requested “daily community prediction history.” The only viable next steps remain:  
   • make the same requests while passing a logged-in Metaculus session cookie;  
   • open the interactive chart in a browser and scrape the embedded JavaScript variable that holds the full time-series; or  
   • probe the Internet Archive for a JSON capture created after January 2026 (e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/202602*/…forecast_time_series).  

Until at least one of these authenticated or archival routes succeeds, any link between semiconductor news and forecast movements can only be qualitative.

B. Nvidia- and semiconductor-sector news likely to move the probability (Jan–Feb 2026)

1. 5 Jan 2026 – CES keynote: Jensen Huang unveiled the Rubin platform, a six-chip AI super-computing stack that NVIDIA claims will cut large-model inference cost to one-tenth that of the prior generation and is already “in full production.” (NVIDIA Blog, 5 Jan 2026). Such a definitive schedule and cost-per-token improvement would normally push Metaculus probabilities upward for any question premised on Nvidia’s ability to ship Rubin or maintain datacentre GPU dominance.  

2. 21 Jan 2026 – Tom’s Hardware reported that NVIDIA is increasing Rubin’s power budget to 2.3 kW and memory bandwidth to 22.2 TB/s to ensure it decisively outperforms AMD’s Instinct MI455X. Higher clocks and looser binning translate into a lower technical-execution risk and potentially higher shipment volumes, again supportive of bullish forecasts on Rubin deployment or Nvidia market share (Tom’s Hardware, 21 Jan 2026).  

3. 26 Jan 2026 – Reuters and Bloomberg, summarised by Gigazine, disclosed that Samsung had reached the “final adjustment stage” to supply HBM4 to Nvidia and would begin mass production in February 2026 (Gigazine, 26 Jan 2026). Securing a second HBM4 source mitigates the single-supplier bottleneck that plagued earlier GPU generations and therefore reduces downside risk for Rubin volumes.  

4. 28 Jan 2026 – Aju Press confirmed both Samsung and SK Hynix plan to ramp HBM4 in February, noting that quality validation by Nvidia is “nearing completion.” The article cites Bank of America’s forecast of a US $54.6 billion HBM market in 2026, up 58 % YoY, underscoring a supply-demand context favourable to Nvidia’s accelerator roadmap (Aju Press, 28 Jan 2026).  

5. 29 Jan 2026 – SK Hynix told analysts it expects to hold a 54 % share of the HBM4 market and has already provided samples to Nvidia (Yonhap, 29 Jan 2026). Assured multi-vendor memory availability further decreases execution risk.  

6. Early February 2026 – Although not captured in the new search tranche, DigiTimes and Counterpoint (referenced in prior round) reported that SK Hynix had cleared final quality milestones and that TSMC guided to ~30 % YoY revenue growth with “ample advanced-node wafer capacity.” Those signals complement the January news by indicating that both memory and foundry constraints are easing.  

Net directional effect: All public information in January–February 2026 points toward (i) Rubin staying on schedule, (ii) at least two memory vendors ready for volume HBM4, and (iii) sufficient advanced-node wafer supply at TSMC. For any Metaculus question whose positive resolution requires Nvidia to deliver Rubin hardware or sustain AI-GPU market leadership through 2026, these headlines would rationally trigger upward steps in the community probability on or shortly after:  
   • 5 Jan (CES reveal)  
   • 26–29 Jan (Samsung & SK Hynix HBM4 readiness)  
   • first week of Feb (SK Hynix quality clearance, TSMC capacity guidance)  

Conversely, if question 40972 is framed in the negative (e.g., “Will Nvidia fail to ship ≥ X Rubin GPUs?”), the same events would drive the probability downward.

C. Remaining information gaps  
1. The exact wording, resolution criteria and closing date of Metaculus question 40972.  
2. The requested daily forecast_time_series JSON (or any numerical anchor points) needed to confirm whether the probability actually reacted on the above dates.  
3. Potential late-February 2026 semiconductor events (export-control changes, CHIPS-Act grant decisions, fab accidents) not surfaced in the current searches that could offset the bullish narrative.

Until these gaps are closed—particularly #1 and #2—the analysis must remain qualitative and conditional.

No additional web queries appear necessary at this stage; the limiting factor is not external news coverage but gated access to Metaculus’s own data.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.
