    "description": "Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40972\n- Original question title: Will Nvidia's stock price close below $100 on any day in 2026?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-01: 15.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> This question will resolve as **Yes** if Nvidia stock's close price is less than \\$100.00 for any regular trading day during 2026, according to [<u>Yahoo Finance</u>](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/history/).\n> \n> If Yahoo Finance is unavailable or found to be inaccurate this question may use alternative [<u>credible sources</u>](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> If there is a stock split or similar price adjustment, the resolution value will adjust to account for the split. Typically this is done by multiplying forward split prices by the split factor and dividing reverse split prices by the split factor.\n\nOriginal background: \n> Nvidia [<u>dominates</u>](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/02/nvidia-dominates-the-ai-chip-market-but-theres-rising-competition-.html) the AI chip market, with 70-95% market share depending on how it is measured. Microsoft [<u>spends</u>](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-techs-spending-drove-nvidias-rise-154027146.html) a full 47% of its capital expenditures on Nvidia chips, Amazon 11%, Meta 25%, Alphabet 15% and Tesla 13%. Many big tech companies also rent data centers from CoreWeave, which itself spends billions on Nvidia chips.\n> \n> On December 5, 2025, Nvidia's stock closed at \\$182.41, up 36% year-to-date. A close below \\$100 a share would be a drop of 45%.\n> \n> At the time of this question, Nvidia\u2019s business has been firing on all cylinders, [<u>selling</u>](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/20/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q3-2025.html) every one of its flagship [<u>Blackwell</u>](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/blackwell-architecture/) chips it can make, with demand projected by analysts to exceed supply well into fiscal year 2026.\n> \n> However, new business challenges have presented themselves. Nvidia faces massive uncertainty in China, with the US in November 2025 [<u>announcing</u>](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-faces-u-ban-scaled-124438728.html) restrictions on sales of scaled-down Nvidia chips to the country, while China itself has [<u>banned</u>](https://convergence-now.com/embedded-tech/china-domestic-ai-chips-ban-data-centres/) Nvidia chips from new data centers. Google is also [<u>ramping up</u>](https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/06/googles_ironwood_tpus_ai/) its Ironwood TPU chips, which [<u>compete</u>](https://xpu.pub/2025/04/16/google-ironwood/) favorably on many metrics with Blackwell.\n> \n> Twenty-six years of Nvidia's stock price history is available from [MacroTrends](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/NVDA/nvidia/stock-price-history).\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40972,\"question_id\":40679,\"last_cp\":0.15}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40972) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-12 18:14:01 is higher than 15.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 15.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-12 18:14:01, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.",
