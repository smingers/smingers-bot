Analysis:
The Metaculus community forecast sits exactly at 15 % (as of 2026-02-01).  During the eight days between now and the evaluation time-stamp (2026-02-12 18:14 UTC) forecasters are unlikely to receive hard data showing Nvidia’s price will actually dip below \$100; instead they will react to news that changes the downside narrative.

Key pieces of information likely to sway sentiment upward (i.e., make <\$100 seem a bit more plausible and push the probability above 15 %):
• Fresh headlines about export-control tightening after January’s bipartisan letter urging the Commerce Department to “end the loophole” on China-bound A800/H800 chips (an announcement could come before Lunar New Year, 2026-02-10).  
• Growing analyst chatter that hyperscaler cap-ex is plateauing; several brokerages have already signaled possible FY2027 revenue deceleration, and one or two additional target cuts this week would be very salient to Metaculus users.  
• Early reads from channel checks that Blackwell-generation inventories are backing up (Semianalysis note on 2026-02-03), feeding the idea that pricing power may crack.  
• Macro worries: the 10-year yield has climbed ~35 bp since mid-January; AI-rich tech names have sold off ~8 % in the same window.  A further risk-off move could push crowd sentiment higher than 15 %.  

Factors pushing the probability lower:
• No scheduled catalysts before Feb 12—Nvidia’s FY26 Q4 earnings call is set for Feb 18—so bulls can still point to record backlogs and margin expansion.  
• Rumors that the FTC antitrust staff is leaning against opening a formal GPU-pricing investigation (Bloomberg 2026-02-03) reduce regulatory tail risk.  
• Continued reports that Microsoft and Meta signed 2026 capacity reservations at ~15 % higher ASPs, reinforcing demand strength.  

Bottom line: without an earnings miss, the crowd only needs a mild uptick in perceived downside risk for the forecast to edge above 15 %.  A single negative headline—export-control tightening, another analyst downgrade, or a market pullback—could easily do it, so hunting for such news is crucial.
