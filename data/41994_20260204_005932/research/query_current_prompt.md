- Original question title: Will Nvidia's stock price close below $100 on any day in 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-01: 15.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as **Yes** if Nvidia stock's close price is less than \$100.00 for any regular trading day during 2026, according to [<u>Yahoo Finance</u>](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/NVDA/history/).
> 
> If Yahoo Finance is unavailable or found to be inaccurate this question may use alternative [<u>credible sources</u>](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).

Original fine print: 
> If there is a stock split or similar price adjustment, the resolution value will adjust to account for the split. Typically this is done by multiplying forward split prices by the split factor and dividing reverse split prices by the split factor.

Original background: 
> Nvidia [<u>dominates</u>](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/06/02/nvidia-dominates-the-ai-chip-market-but-theres-rising-competition-.html) the AI chip market, with 70-95% market share depending on how it is measured. Microsoft [<u>spends</u>](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-techs-spending-drove-nvidias-rise-154027146.html) a full 47% of its capital expenditures on Nvidia chips, Amazon 11%, Meta 25%, Alphabet 15% and Tesla 13%. Many big tech companies also rent data centers from CoreWeave, which itself spends billions on Nvidia chips.
> 
> On December 5, 2025, Nvidia's stock closed at \$182.41, up 36% year-to-date. A close below \$100 a share would be a drop of 45%.
> 
> At the time of this question, Nvidia’s business has been firing on all cylinders, [<u>selling</u>](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/20/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q3-2025.html) every one of its flagship [<u>Blackwell</u>](https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/data-center/technologies/blackwell-architecture/) chips it can make, with demand projected by analysts to exceed supply well into fiscal year 2026.
> 
> However, new business challenges have presented themselves. Nvidia faces massive uncertainty in China, with the US in November 2025 [<u>announcing</u>](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-faces-u-ban-scaled-124438728.html) restrictions on sales of scaled-down Nvidia chips to the country, while China itself has [<u>banned</u>](https://convergence-now.com/embedded-tech/china-domestic-ai-chips-ban-data-centres/) Nvidia chips from new data centers. Google is also [<u>ramping up</u>](https://www.theregister.com/2025/11/06/googles_ironwood_tpus_ai/) its Ironwood TPU chips, which [<u>compete</u>](https://xpu.pub/2025/04/16/google-ironwood/) favorably on many metrics with Blackwell.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For AskNews:
Your query for AskNews will be processed more naturally, so feel free to write a sentence-long query in natural language. Avoid using ambiguous acronyms. Specify relevant criteria (e.g., geography, industry, time period) to ensure the correct scope. If desired, you can indicate multiple kinds of news articles you're looking for in your query. Keep your query to a maximum of two sentences. Important note: Do not prefix your query with 'AskNews:' or something similar. Please add the word 'AskNews' enclosed in brackets at the end of the query, referring closely to the example below.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () (NOT curly brackets, NOT square brackets [], you need to use normal brackets ()) **on the same line as and after** the query, applicable for Google, Google News and AskNews.

1. One query for google?
