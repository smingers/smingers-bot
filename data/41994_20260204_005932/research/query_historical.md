Analysis:
The likelihood that the Metaculus community prediction tops 15 % on 2026-02-12 will depend on two main factors:  
a) How the crowd probability on question 40972 has actually trended since launch—does it drift gradually or jump on news?; and  
b) News and fundamentals that could plausibly shift sentiment over the next eight days, especially Nvidia’s share-price drivers such as earnings dates, China export restrictions, AI-chip competition and overall market conditions.  
Historical community-prediction data give an empirical base-rate for late-cycle moves on Metaculus equity questions, while current analyst/press coverage of Nvidia reveals whether any imminent catalyst might push the crowd above (or keep it below) the 15 % threshold. Therefore I’ll search for: 1) Nvidia price/analyst outlooks for 2026, 2) very recent news that might alter expectations this week, and 3) the precise time-series of the community prediction itself.
