'seismic' Nvidia shift, AI chip shortages and how it's threatening to hike gadget prices\"\n\n**Source:** CNBC, December 02, 2025, by Arjun Kharpal\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- **Memory price increases:** Counterpoint Research expects memory prices to rise 30% in Q4 2025 and another 20% in early 2026\n- **Supply-demand imbalance:** Current imbalances are hitting 3% levels, which is \"very significant\" (typically 1-2% imbalances can trigger sharp price increases)\n- **Component cost impact:** DRAM and storage represent approximately 10-25% of the bill of materials for a typical PC or smartphone\n- **Price impact projection:** A 20-30% increase in these components would increase total bill of materials costs by 5-10%\n- **Capacity timeline:** It takes 2-3 years to add semiconductor manufacturing fabs\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n**Peter Hanbury, Partner at Bain & Company:**\n- \"We see the rapid increase in demand for AI in data centers driving bottlenecks in many areas\"\n- Direct cause of shortage is rapid increase in demand for data center chips\n- Suppliers were risk-averse and didn't build capacity to meet customer estimates, worried the market was too optimistic\n- Impact on prices will \"likely start shortly as component costs are already increasing and likely accelerate into next year\"\n- Other markets (automobiles, industrials, aerospace and defense) \"will likely see some impact from these price increases as well\"\n\n**Eddie Wu, CEO of Alibaba:**\n- There are shortages across semiconductor manufacturers, memory chips, and storage devices like hard drives\n- \"There is a situation of undersupply\"\n- The \"supply side is going to be a relatively large bottleneck\"\n- This could last two to three years\n\n**MS Hwang, Research Director at Counterpoint Research:**\n- \"DRAM is certainly a bottleneck as AI investments continue to feed the imbalance between demand and supply with HBM for AI being prioritized by chipmakers\"\n- \"We also see a bigger risk on the horizon is with advanced memory as Nvidia's recent pivot to LPDDR means they're a customer on the scale of a major smartphone maker \u2014 a seismic shift for the supply chain which can't easily absorb this scale of demand\"\n- \"Beyond the rise in cost there's a second issue and that's the inability to secure enough components, which constrains the production of electronic devices\"\n\n**Jeff Clark, COO at Dell:**\n- Price rises of components are \"unprecedented\"\n- \"We have not seen costs move at the rate that we've seen\"\n- Pressure is seen across various types of memory chips and storage hard drives\n\n## Key Developments:\n\n**Nvidia's Strategic Shift:**\n- Nvidia is increasingly shifting toward using Low-Power Double Data Rate (LPDDR) memory in its products (more power efficient than DDR)\n- Nvidia is using the latest generation of LPDDR memory, which is also used by high-end consumer electronics makers like Samsung and Apple\n- This adds Nvidia as a customer \"on the scale of a major smartphone maker\" for components typically only demanded by a handful of big electronics players\n\n**Supply Chain Bottlenecks:**\n- Shortages of hard disk drives (HDDs) used in data centers\n- Hyperscalers shifting to solid-state drives (SSDs) due to HDD capacity constraints, but SSDs are key components for consumer electronics\n- High-bandwidth memory (HBM) demand creating DRAM shortages\n- Chipmakers prioritizing HBM and GPUs over other types of semiconductors\n\n**Company Warnings:**\n- Xiaomi (third-biggest smartphone vendor globally) expects consumers will see \"a sizeable rise in product retail prices\" (per Reuters report)\n\n**Potential Consequences:**\n- Smartphone and PC prices may rise\n- Possible shortages of consumer electronics devices if manufacturers can't secure needed components\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary

The model's signal snapshot shows positive momentum, with both the MACD and RSI indicators skewed upward. Despite recent valuation debates, Nvidia's stock has risen slightly over the past month, reflecting renewed confidence in AI infrastructure tailwinds. The AI model's projection is based on recent price action and technical indicators. While the short-term forecast suggests a modest uptick, long-term projections from the same AI model suggest Nvidia could reach $350 by 2030. Nvidia's dominance in AI accelerators underpins its growth, with demand outpacing production capacity, resulting in a multiyear backlog that ensures revenue visibility. The company maintains pricing power and market leadership amid accelerating data center spending by hyperscalers and enterprises. Analysts maintain a Strong Buy consensus, with 12-month price targets ranging from the mid-$220s to mid-$240s, and some aggressive estimates reaching the high-$260s.

Four of the seven have reported quarterly results: Tesla, Apple, Microsoft, and Meta. While Meta saw a significant stock price increase post-earnings, the reactions for Tesla, Apple, and especially Microsoft were subdued, with Microsoft's stock falling to its lowest level since late April 2025. This was driven by slightly below-expected growth in its Azure division (39% vs. guidance of 37\u201338%) and massive capital spending on AI infrastructure, despite an overall solid earnings report. This suggests market caution regarding future profitability amid the ongoing AI race. The remaining three companies\u2014Alphabet (Google), Amazon, and Nvidia\u2014are set to report, with Nvidia concluding on February 25. The combined market capitalization of the Magnificent Seven is $21 trillion, representing 62% of the Nasdaq 100 index. The index has not made a new high since October and has been trading within a consolidation range. As of the article's writing, the index is at the midpoint of this range; a break below the lower boundary near the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement could signal a bearish breakout, potentially accelerating a correction toward the next Fibonacci level (38.2%), which coincides with the prior resistance zone from late 2024 to early 2025.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 06:00 PM\nSource:[Capital.fr](https://www.capital.fr/entreprises-marches/bourse-tesla-amazon-nvidia-meta-apple-les-actions-des-7-magnifiques-foncent-elles-vers-un-krach-1523394)\n\n**On Tuesday 3rd of February Nvidia trades -2.89 percent lower**\nOn Tuesday, February 3, 2026, Nvidia (NVDA) traded 2.89% lower during a 24-hour period ending at 04:55 PM Central Europe Time, with the stock priced at USD 180.36. The company's market capitalization stood at USD 4.7 trillion, and USD 29.7 billion worth of shares were traded in the past day. Nvidia's stock has declined 1.33% since the end of last month. The 52-week high was USD 212.19 (recorded on October 29, 2025), and the 52-week low was USD 86.62 (on April 7, 2025). The recent drop followed uncertainty around a proposed $100 billion investment in OpenAI, which was reported to be on hold. However, CEO Jensen Huang clarified that the investment was not a firm commitment and discussions were ongoing, which helped stabilize the stock. Despite the volatility, Nvidia remains a leading supplier of AI-accelerating graphics processors, with strong industry support, including praise from OpenAI's CEO.

Wall Street analysts present divergent views: Mark Lipacis of Evercore maintains a bullish target of $352 per share, reflecting 83% upside from the current $192 share price, citing Nvidia\u2019s dominant 85% market share in AI accelerators, full-stack strategy (including GPUs, CPUs, networking, and software), and leadership in both data center AI and physical AI (e.g., autonomous vehicles and robots). Conversely, Jay Goldberg of Seaport Research takes a bearish stance, recommending a sell with a target of $140 per share, or 27% downside, due to rising competition from custom AI chips like Google\u2019s TPUs and Meta\u2019s planned investments, as well as margin pressures from high bandwidth memory (HBM) shortages and Nvidia\u2019s $26 billion cloud capacity commitment over six years. Despite these concerns, the author predicts Nvidia stock will reach $260 per share by December 2026\u2014a 35% increase from $192\u2014justifying this midpoint estimate between the bullish and bearish extremes. The prediction is supported by Goldman Sachs\u2019 observation that AI capital expenditures have consistently been underestimated, suggesting upside potential, and by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s emphasis on autonomous machines as the next AI frontier, with increasing robotaxi deployments by Waymo and Tesla expected to boost Nvidia\u2019s relevance and valuation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 08:35 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/31/nvidia-stock-will-soar-this-price-2026-ai-boom/)\n\n**This Is Nvidia's Price Prediction Heading Into 2016 According To This Market**\nNvidia (NVDA) has surged 1,000% since late 2022, driven by the AI boom, with its stock peaking at $212 per share in October 2025 before settling into a sideways range between $170 and $180. The company reported record fiscal Q3 revenue of $57 billion and $500 billion in AI chip orders through 2026. However, investor sentiment has cooled, with the stock down 16% from its October highs amid market rotation out of tech and concerns over valuation. According to Polymarket, a decentralized prediction platform, there is a 71% probability Nvidia will reach $190 by December 31, 2026, an 84% chance of hitting $185, and a 43% chance of reaching $200. Downside risks are limited: only a 44% chance of falling to $165 and a 32% chance of dropping to $160. Extreme moves\u2014such as a $260 upside or $125 downside\u2014are each priced at less than 5%, indicating market consensus that Nvidia will remain near its current $180 trading range through year-end, with minimal conviction for a breakout. Additionally, Alphabet secured a multi-billion-dollar deal with Meta Platforms to integrate TPUs starting in 2027, signaling a potential long-term challenge to Nvidia\u2019s market dominance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 03:37 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

He emphasized that despite aggressive efforts by hyperscalers like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META) to develop their own silicon, Nvidia remains the undisputed 'Godfather of AI.' Ives highlighted a 12-to-1 supply-demand imbalance for Nvidia chips, with inventory reportedly sold out through 2026, stating that doubting Nvidia\u2019s dominance is 'the wrong move.' He projected the current tech bull market will extend into 2026, likening the AI-driven rally to a party that started at 9 p.m. and is now only at 10:30 p.m., with festivities expected to continue until 4 a.m. Ives advised investors to prepare for the S&P 500 to reach 7,000. Beyond Nvidia (NVDA), he identified Palantir (PLTR) as a potential $1 trillion market cap company within two to three years, and recommended Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), and CrowdStrike (CRWD) as core holdings. On consumer tech, he maintained a bullish stance on Tesla (TSLA), setting an $800 price target based on a potential $1 trillion valuation for its autonomous driving business, and predicted a consumer AI revolution led by Apple (AAPL), forecasting an iPhone 17 supercycle. NVDA has risen 30.33% year-to-date, outperforming the Nasdaq 100\u2019s 20.32% return, and closed at $180.26, up 1.37% on the day.

This follows 171% gains in 2024 and 239% in 2023, fueling a gravity-defying rally that pushed Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization to $5 trillion\u2014the first company to reach this milestone. Earlier in 2025, it had also become the first company to exceed $4 trillion in market cap. According to Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah, Nvidia could reach an $8.5 trillion market cap within a year, with a $350 target price\u2014higher than the average sell-side analyst estimate of $234.51. The AI boom is cited as a key driver, with hyperscalers like Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) increasing their capital expenditures (capex) for AI infrastructure. Despite some signs of tech firms exploring alternative chips, Nvidia\u2019s CUDA computing platform remains the de facto standard for AI development, creating significant user lock-in. Microsoft, which previously projected lower capex growth for fiscal year 2026 (ending June 30, 2026), now expects higher spending, while Meta has repeatedly raised its 2025 capex guidance and anticipates notable increases in 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 08, 2025 02:12 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

This growth is driven by AI and cloud computing, with Nvidia's earnings soaring from a few billion to $86.6 billion in trailing-12-month net income. The company is expected to report fiscal Q3 2026 earnings on Nov. 19, with analyst consensus forecasting $4.51 and $6.43 in earnings per share for fiscal 2026 and 2027, respectively. At a current stock price of $184.44, Nvidia\u2019s projected P/E ratio for 2027 is 28.7, which is reasonable; a 40 P/E would imply a stock price of $257.20 and a market cap of $6.22 trillion. Microsoft, with a $3.82 trillion market cap, is also positioned to reach $5 trillion with a 32% increase from its current price, driven by strong earnings growth from Azure, AI integration across Microsoft 365, Dynamics, GitHub, LinkedIn, and its $69 billion Activision-Blizzard acquisition. The 'Ten Titans' \u2014 Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Broadcom, Meta Platforms, Tesla, Oracle, and Netflix \u2014 collectively make up 39% of the S&P 500 and have delivered strong returns. Despite elevated valuations, both Nvidia and Microsoft are seen as resilient due to high margins, strong balance sheets, and cash reserves, enabling them to withstand economic downturns or competitive pressures. The Motley Fool recommends focusing on quality companies and highlights these two as long-term growth leaders, with options strategies suggested for Microsoft. The article concludes that investors should evaluate companies based on their ability to meet expectations rather than price alone.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 04:20 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/27/prediction-nvidia-will-form-the-5-trillion-club-be/?source=newstex&utm_source=newstex&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=dd2fe63e-58bc-42ed-bbc4-386e386dd5f8)\n\n**Prediction: Nvidia Stock Is Going to Soar After Nov. 19**\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is predicted to see its stock soar after the release of its fiscal 2026 third-quarter results on November 19, 2025. The company, the world's leading supplier of AI chips for data centers, is expected to report revenue of approximately $54 billion\u2014a 54% year-over-year increase\u2014with the data center segment accounting for nearly 90% of that. Wall Street consensus estimates call for earnings of $1.24 per share, a 53% increase from the prior year. Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell Ultra GB300 GPUs, which deliver up to 50 times more performance than the H100 chips, are in high demand due to the rising computational needs of advanced AI reasoning models from companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta Platforms. The upcoming Rubin GPU architecture, rumored to be 3.3 times more powerful than Blackwell Ultra, could further solidify Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the projected $4 trillion in data center infrastructure spending between now and 2030. Despite trading near a record high, Nvidia\u2019s current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 51.9 is 15% below its 10-year average of 60.9, suggesting potential undervaluation. If earnings meet or exceed expectations, the P/E ratio could appear even more attractive, with forward P/E ratios of 40.5 for fiscal 2026 and 28.6 for fiscal 2027. Analysts predict Nvidia stock could need to rise 113% over the next 12 to 18 months to return to its 10-year average P/E, indicating strong upside potential. The November 19 conference call, featuring CEO Jensen Huang, may also provide forward guidance, with Wall Street expecting fourth-quarter revenue of $61.1 billion\u2014any upward revision could act as a bullish catalyst. The article concludes that as long as Nvidia continues to meet or exceed expectations, the market will continue pricing in its future potential.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 08:40 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/17/prediction-nvidia-stock-going-to-soar-after-nov-19/?source=newstex&utm_source=newstex&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=476586aa-18b4-49d5-9778-1cd11f19d638)\n\n**Prediction: This Will Be Nvidia's Stock Price 5 Years From Now | The Motley Fool**\nThe article forecasts that Nvidia\u2019s stock could rise to about $608 per share and a market cap of $14.8\u202ftrillion by 2030, based on projected data\u2011center spending of $3\u20134\u202ftrillion and Nvidia\u2019s current 92\u202f% share of the GPU market. It cites that hyperscalers such as Microsoft, Meta, Alphabet and Amazon are expected to spend $454\u202fbillion on capex in 2026, a 26\u202f% increase, largely for AI. CEO Jensen Huang stated that Nvidia\u2019s GPUs, semiconductors, accelerators, networking gear and full AI\u2011supercomputers account for 58\u202f% (or more) of data\u2011center infrastructure spending and that data\u2011center spending could reach $3\u20134\u202ftrillion by 2030. Using a 20\u00d7 forward price\u2011to\u2011sales ratio, the author projects a 265\u202f% jump in share price to $608 if Nvidia\u2019s revenue reaches $750\u202fbillion, a more than six\u2011fold increase from its $115\u202fbillion fiscal\u20112025 data\u2011center revenue. The piece acknowledges risks such as competition and the possibility that hyperscalers may use rival chips. It concludes that even if projections fall short, Nvidia\u2019s GPUs remain the gold standard for AI and will continue to drive growth in sectors like robotics, self\u2011driving cars, healthcare and manufacturing. The author notes that Nvidia trades at 26\u00d7 next year\u2019s earnings and is therefore attractively priced given its ongoing opportunities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 07, 2025 11:43 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/09/07/prediction-this-will-be-nvidias-stock-price-5-year/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
