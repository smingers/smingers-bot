Answers\n\n**Source:** 24/7 Wall St., January 25, 2026, by William Temple\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **China Market Approval:** China has reportedly indicated willingness to approve NVIDIA H200 chips for import, with CEO Jensen Huang currently in Shanghai. However, significant uncertainty remains about whether this represents full H200 capability or a restricted version with performance caps, volume quotas, or end-use restrictions.\n\n2. **Historical China Revenue:** China previously represented 20-30% of Nvidia's revenue share. According to CFO Colette Kress in the Q3 FY 2026 earnings call, China data center revenue grew sequentially on \"export-compliant copper products,\" but \"remains well below levels prior to the onset of export controls.\"\n\n3. **Stock Performance:**\n   - NVDA: up 0.77% over the past week\n   - AMD: surged 12% over the same period\n   - Nvidia's stock showed limited movement following the China approval news\n\n4. **Valuation Metrics:**\n   - AMD: trades at 41x forward earnings with 60% YoY earnings growth and a PEG ratio of 0.56\n   - Nvidia: forward P/E stands at 25x\n\n5. **Insider Selling Activity:**\n   - CEO Huang sold 9.9 million shares between October and December 2025\n   - CFO Kress sold over 200,000 shares in the same window, with concentrated selling in mid-December around the approval timeline\n   - No executives purchased stock during this period\n\n6. **Competitive Landscape:**\n   - AMD's MI400 accelerators are shipping alongside Nvidia systems\n   - Intel CEO Lip-Bu Tan stated Intel was \"caught off guard\" by AI data center demand and cannot meet supply\n   - China's domestic alternatives include Alibaba's T-Head and Baidu's Kunlunxin processors\n\n## Analysis Context:\n\nThe article emphasizes uncertainty around the practical implications of China's approval, noting that questions remain about conditions, volume, and deployment restrictions. The market's muted response to the news and significant insider selling activity are highlighted as noteworthy factors.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve daily community prediction history for Metaculus question 40972 and summarize key Nvidia\u2013semiconductor sector news Jan-Feb 2026 likely to influence probability.\nA. Status of the \u201cdaily community-prediction history\u201d for Metaculus question 40972  \n1. The two canonical API endpoints\u2014/api2/questions/40972/ and /api2/questions/40972/forecast_time_series/\u2014still return HTTP 404 to an unauthenticated client. A fresh Google scan for public mirrors, CSV dumps or Wayback captures again produced no hits (see searches returned \u201cNo usable content extracted.\u201d).  \n2. GitHub repositories that periodically archive Metaculus data (e.g., nikosbosse/Metaculus-data-analyses and several historical gists) continue to stop at question IDs created before 2024. Question 40972 therefore remains absent from every open-source snapshot located so far.  \n3. Because the question text and the JSON time-series are both inaccessible, it is still impossible to supply the requested \u201cdaily community prediction history.\u201d The only viable next steps remain:  \n   \u2022 make the same requests while passing a logged-in Metaculus session cookie;  \n   \u2022 open the interactive chart in a browser and scrape the embedded JavaScript variable that holds the full time-series; or  \n   \u2022 probe the Internet Archive for a JSON capture created after January 2026 (e.g. https://web.archive.org/web/202602*/\u2026forecast_time_series).  \n\nUntil at least one of these authenticated or archival routes succeeds, any link between semiconductor news and forecast movements can only be qualitative.\n\nB. Nvidia- and semiconductor-sector news likely to move the probability (Jan\u2013Feb 2026)\n\n1. 5 Jan 2026 \u2013 CES keynote: Jensen Huang unveiled the Rubin platform, a six-chip AI super-computing stack that NVIDIA claims will cut large-model inference cost to one-tenth that of the prior generation and is already \u201cin full production.\u201d (NVIDIA Blog, 5 Jan 2026). Such a definitive schedule and cost-per-token improvement would normally push Metaculus probabilities upward for any question premised on Nvidia\u2019s ability to ship Rubin or maintain datacentre GPU dominance.  \n\n2. 21 Jan 2026 \u2013 Tom\u2019s Hardware reported that NVIDIA is increasing Rubin\u2019s power budget to 2.3 kW and memory bandwidth to 22.2 TB/s to ensure it decisively outperforms AMD\u2019s Instinct MI455X. Higher clocks and looser binning translate into a lower technical-execution risk and potentially higher shipment volumes, again supportive of bullish forecasts on Rubin deployment or Nvidia market share (Tom\u2019s Hardware, 21 Jan 2026).  \n\n3. 26 Jan 2026 \u2013 Reuters and Bloomberg, summarised by Gigazine, disclosed that Samsung had reached the \u201cfinal adjustment stage\u201d to supply HBM4 to Nvidia and would begin mass production in February 2026 (Gigazine, 26 Jan 2026). Securing a second HBM4 source mitigates the single-supplier bottleneck that plagued earlier GPU generations and therefore reduces downside risk for Rubin volumes.  \n\n4. 28 Jan 2026 \u2013 Aju Press confirmed both Samsung and SK Hynix plan to ramp HBM4 in February, noting that quality validation by Nvidia is \u201cnearing completion.\u201d The article cites Bank of America\u2019s forecast of a US $54.6 billion HBM market in 2026, up 58 % YoY, underscoring a supply-demand context favourable to Nvidia\u2019s accelerator roadmap (Aju Press, 28 Jan 2026).  \n\n5. 29 Jan 2026 \u2013 SK Hynix told analysts it expects to hold a 54 % share of the HBM4 market and has already provided samples to Nvidia (Yonhap, 29 Jan 2026). Assured multi-vendor memory availability further decreases execution risk.  \n\n6. Early February 2026 \u2013 Although not captured in the new search tranche, DigiTimes and Counterpoint (referenced in prior round) reported that SK Hynix had cleared final quality milestones and that TSMC guided to ~30 % YoY revenue growth with \u201cample advanced-node wafer capacity.\u201d Those signals complement the January news by indicating that both memory and foundry constraints are easing.  \n\nNet directional effect: All public information in January\u2013February 2026 points toward (i) Rubin staying on schedule, (ii) at least two memory vendors ready for volume HBM4, and (iii) sufficient advanced-node wafer supply at TSMC. For any Metaculus question whose positive resolution requires Nvidia to deliver Rubin hardware or sustain AI-GPU market leadership through 2026, these headlines would rationally trigger upward steps in the community probability on or shortly after:  \n   \u2022 5 Jan (CES reveal)  \n   \u2022 26\u201329 Jan (Samsung & SK Hynix HBM4 readiness)  \n   \u2022 first week of Feb (SK Hynix quality clearance, TSMC capacity guidance)  \n\nConversely, if question 40972 is framed in the negative (e.g., \u201cWill Nvidia fail to ship \u2265 X Rubin GPUs?\u201d), the same events would drive the probability downward.\n\nC. Remaining information gaps  \n1. The exact wording, resolution criteria and closing date of Metaculus question 40972.  \n2. The requested daily forecast_time_series JSON (or any numerical anchor points) needed to confirm whether the probability actually reacted on the above dates.  \n3. Potential late-February 2026 semiconductor events (export-control changes, CHIPS-Act grant decisions, fab accidents) not surfaced in the current searches that could offset the bullish narrative.\n\nUntil these gaps are closed\u2014particularly #1 and #2\u2014the analysis must remain qualitative and conditional.\n\nNo additional web queries appear necessary at this stage; the limiting factor is not external news coverage but gated access to Metaculus\u2019s own data.</Agent_report>\n"
