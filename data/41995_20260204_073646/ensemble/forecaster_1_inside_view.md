Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Recent News Articles (Feb 2-4, 2026):**

1. **PoPville (Jan 28, 2026)** - Local DC news site. Reports OPM operating status announcement for Jan 29. Factual, administrative content. Quality: Medium. Relevance: Low - outside prediction window.

2. **NASWA Winter Policy Forum** - Event listing for Feb 25, 2026. Factual but occurs after prediction window. Quality: Medium. Relevance: None.

3. **Government Executive Events Page** - Calendar of government conferences Feb 4-15. No OPM-specific events mentioned. Quality: Medium. Relevance: Low.

4. **Government Executive (Feb 3, 2026)** - High-quality trade publication. **Key facts**: Congress ended 4-day shutdown on Feb 3, Trump signed bill, guaranteed furloughed feds backpay, OPM guidance controversy over backpay language. Quality: High. Relevance: **Very High** - major OPM story resolved Feb 3, one day before prediction start.

5. **Government Executive (Feb 2, 2026)** - Reports furloughs beginning Feb 2, multiple agencies affected including OPM itself. Quality: High. Relevance: **Very High** - peak shutdown news period.

6. **Government Executive (Feb 3, 2026 - shutdown ends)** - Confirms shutdown lasted less than 4 days, ended Feb 3. Quality: High. Relevance: **Critical** - establishes timeline of peak OPM news interest.

**AskNews Articles:**

7. **South Korea-US military exercises** - Discusses "OPCON" (operational control), not OPM. Irrelevant.

8. **Euro-Zone inflation** - No OPM relevance.

9. **SLM Corporation legal notice** - No OPM relevance.

10. **Chinese bank credit** - No OPM relevance.

11. **India-US trade deal/shrimp searches** - No OPM relevance.

12. **OPM Market slowdown (Oct 30, 2025)** - **Critical disambiguation**: This discusses "Online Program Manager" market in education, NOT Office of Personnel Management. Shows OPM has multiple meanings, but Google Trends for "opm" in US context during government shutdown would overwhelmingly refer to Office of Personnel Management.

13. **Google Green Card/PERM (Dec 23, 2025)** - Discusses immigration process, no direct OPM connection.

**Factual Evidence vs. Opinion:**
- Government Executive articles provide factual reporting with named sources (Rep. Walkinshaw, Speaker Johnson, Sen. Schumer)
- Timeline facts are verifiable: shutdown Feb 2-3, resolved Feb 3
- No significant expert opinions about future OPM search trends

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Shutdown timeline confirmed by multiple sources**: Shutdown announced ~Jan 31, furloughs began Feb 2, resolved Feb 3. This creates a clear peak-decay pattern. OPM was central to shutdown story (guidance on backpay, OPM itself furloughed employees).
2. **Current Google Trends data shows decay in progress**: Value dropped from 46.6 (week prior) → 23.7 (last week) → 16 (Feb 4). This is a 66% decline over ~2 weeks, indicating strong momentum.
3. **No major OPM events Feb 4-15**: Agent report found only minor regulatory effective date (Feb 13), no major policy announcements or events.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Post-crisis search decay pattern**: Standard pattern shows search interest peaks during crisis, then decays exponentially. We're 1-2 days post-resolution, prime decay period.
2. **Base rate volatility**: 72% of 12-day windows show >3 point changes, but this doesn't account for directional momentum.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **DHS funding expires Feb 13**: Could generate minor OPM search interest if shutdown concerns resurface, but unlikely to match Feb 2-3 peak.
2. **"OPM" alternative meanings**: Online Program Manager articles show term ambiguity, but unlikely to affect US Google Trends during government news cycle.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction window**: 11 days (Feb 4 to Feb 15)
**Current position**: Day 1-2 of post-shutdown decay phase
**Resolution criteria**: Feb 15 value compared to Feb 4 value (16)

**If timeframe halved (5-6 days to ~Feb 10):**
- Would increase "Doesn't change" probability to ~25-30%
- Shorter window = less time for full decay
- Value might stabilize in 13-19 range temporarily

**If timeframe doubled (22 days to ~Feb 26):**
- Would increase "Decreases" probability to ~85-90%
- Longer decay period = more likely to reach lower baseline (10-12 range)
- Mean reversion toward 90-day average (18.1) less relevant given strong directional trend

**Key consideration**: The 11-day window is substantial for decay continuation but not so long that mean reversion becomes dominant factor.

**(d) Justification:**

**Outside view base rates:**
- 72% of windows show >3 point changes
- Current value (16) below 90-day mean (18.1)

**Factors shifting prediction toward "Decreases":**

1. **Exponential decay momentum** (Strong evidence): The 66% decline over 2 weeks (46.6→16) follows classic post-event decay curve. Mathematical projection: If decay continues at even half that rate, value would reach ~10-12 by Feb 15.

2. **Crisis resolved, no new catalysts** (Strong evidence): Shutdown ended Feb 3. No comparable events scheduled Feb 4-15. DHS funding deadline (Feb 13) is minor compared to full government shutdown.

3. **Timing within decay cycle** (Moderate evidence): Feb 4 is Day 1-2 post-resolution. Peak decay typically occurs Days 1-7 after crisis resolution. We're entering the steepest part of the curve.

4. **OPM's role diminishing** (Moderate evidence): With shutdown resolved and backpay guaranteed, OPM's newsworthiness returns to baseline administrative functions.

**Factors potentially supporting "Doesn't change":**

1. **Decay could stall at current level** (Weak): Value of 16 is near recent lows, might represent temporary floor before further decline.

2. **DHS deadline Feb 13** (Weak): Could generate minor bump, but unlikely to sustain value >19 or prevent overall decline.

**Factors potentially supporting "Increases":**

1. **Unexpected OPM announcement** (Weak): No indicators in sources.

2. **Alternative "OPM" meaning surge** (Very weak): Online Program Manager or music unlikely to override government agency searches during this period.

**Calibration logic:**

The outside view suggested 75% Decreases, 17% Doesn't change, 8% Increases. The inside view evidence **strongly reinforces** this distribution:

- Strong directional momentum (66% decline continuing)
- Clear causal mechanism (post-crisis decay)
- No countervailing factors
- 11-day window sufficient for continued decay

However, I should slightly increase "Doesn't change" probability because:
- Value of 16 is already fairly low (below mean)
- Some decay stalling is possible
- DHS deadline could provide minor support

But "Decreases" remains highly likely because:
- Decay curves rarely stall immediately after crisis
- Mathematical projection points to 10-12 range
- No evidence of stabilization in current data

**Probability Calibration:**

**Increases (>19)**: 5%
- Requires unexpected major OPM news
- No indicators in sources
- Would need value to rise from 16 to 20+, reversing strong downward trend
- Blind spot: Unforeseen OPM policy announcement or new shutdown threat

**Doesn't change (13-19)**: 22%
- Requires decay to halt precisely at current level
- Possible if 16 represents temporary floor
- DHS deadline (Feb 13) could provide minor support
- Range of 13-19 gives some buffer
- More plausible than outside view suggested due to already-low current value

**Decreases (<13)**: 73%
- Strong momentum (46.6→23.7→16 = clear trend)
- Typical post-crisis decay pattern
- 11-day window sufficient for continued decline
- Mathematical projection: ~10-12 by Feb 15
- No significant countervailing factors

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Google Trends value for "opm" on Feb 15 be >3 points higher (Increases), within 3 points (Doesn't change), or >3 points lower (Decreases) than Feb 4 value of 16?

2. **Base rate**: Outside view: 75% Decreases, 17% Doesn't change, 8% Increases. Final prediction maintains this structure with minor adjustments based on inside evidence.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = Decreases (73%); Least likely = Increases (5%). Makes sense given strong decay momentum and no new catalysts.

4. **Top evidence**:
   - 66% decline over 2 weeks (46.6→16) shows strong momentum
   - Shutdown resolved Feb 3, removing main news driver
   - No major OPM events Feb 4-15
   - Post-crisis decay pattern well-established
   - Current value (16) projects to 10-12 by Feb 15

5. **Blind spot**: Unexpected OPM policy announcement (Schedule F revival, new buyout program, surprise shutdown threat) could reverse trend. This would make "Increases" outcome occur. Probability: ~5%.

6. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.
