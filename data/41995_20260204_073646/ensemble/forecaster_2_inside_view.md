Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**News Articles from Current Context (Jan-Feb 2026):**

1. **PoPville (Jan 28, 2026)** - Factual announcement of OPM operating status for Jan 29. High quality for operational facts, but routine announcement with no predictive value for search trends. **No opinions.**

2. **Gov Executive (Feb 3, 2026) - Congress guarantees backpay** - High-quality reporting on Feb 3 shutdown resolution. Contains factual timeline: 4-day shutdown ended Feb 3, House voted 217-214, Trump signed bill. Notable: OPM guidance changes regarding backpay (Jan 30 update deleted automatic backpay language). **Opinion from Rep. Walkinshaw** (identifiable expert) criticizing Trump admin use of shutdowns. **Strong evidence** of elevated OPM attention during Jan 30-Feb 3 period.

3. **Gov Executive (Feb 2, 2026) - Employees begin furloughs** - High-quality, factual reporting. Confirms OPM among agencies experiencing funding lapse on Feb 2. Lists specific agency actions. **Strong evidence** that OPM was in headlines Feb 2-3.

4. **Gov Executive (Feb 3, 2026) - Partial shutdown ends** - High-quality reporting confirming shutdown ended Feb 3 after less than 4 days. Provides voting details and funding specifics. **Strong evidence** that the OPM-related news cycle peaked around Feb 2-3 and concluded Feb 3.

5. **DirectEmployers/NASWA Winter Policy Forum** - Event scheduled Feb 25, 2026 (outside forecast window). Irrelevant to Feb 4-15 period.

6. **Gov Executive Events Page** - Lists various government events Feb 4-14. None specifically mention OPM. Weak relevance.

**AskNews Articles:**

Most articles are irrelevant (South Korea military, eurozone inflation, legal investigations, banking, trade deals, tech trends, bonds, oil, Bitcoin, workforce AI, commodities). 

**Relevant article:**
- **Validated Insights OPM Report (Oct 30, 2025)** - High-quality market research on "Online Program Manager" (OPM) market contraction. This is about education OPMs, NOT Office of Personnel Management. Shows 45% decline in partnerships, revenue down to $3.37B. **This is a different "OPM" meaning** - likely explains some baseline search volume but not relevant to federal government OPM spikes.

**Key factual finding:** "OPM" has two distinct meanings that drive search interest:
1. U.S. Office of Personnel Management (federal agency)
2. Online Program Managers (education industry) / Original Pilipino Music (entertainment)

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Government shutdown Feb 2-3, 2026:** Multiple independent sources (Gov Executive articles) confirm OPM was directly affected by shutdown, with furloughs beginning Feb 2 and ending Feb 3. This created a **discrete news spike** that would drive searches.
- **Current date is Feb 4:** The shutdown just ended yesterday. News cycle momentum typically decays rapidly after resolution.
- **Historical data:** 7-day average dropped from 46.6 to 23.7 (50% decline) in the week before Feb 4, with current value at 16. This suggests the shutdown spike (likely peaked Jan 31-Feb 3) is **already declining**.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **No major OPM-related events scheduled Feb 5-15:** Event listings show no government workforce events, policy announcements, or OPM-specific catalysts in the forecast window.
- **Shutdown resolved with backpay guaranteed:** The controversy is settled, reducing ongoing news coverage incentive.
- **Mean reversion tendency:** Current value (16) is below 90-day mean (18.1), but the recent spike-and-crash pattern suggests we're in a post-event decay phase rather than a stable equilibrium.

**Weak Evidence:**
- Philippine OPM concerts Feb 6-14: These might drive some "opm" searches but historically appear to create smaller, localized spikes compared to federal government news.
- General government events Feb 4-14: Could maintain baseline federal workforce interest but unlikely to spike OPM-specific searches.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Forecast window:** 11 days (Feb 4 → Feb 15, 2026)

**Key temporal factors:**
1. **News decay curve:** Government shutdown stories typically have 3-5 day news cycles. We're on Day 2 of post-resolution (shutdown ended Feb 3, today is Feb 4). Expect continued decay Feb 4-8.
2. **Weekend effect:** Feb 8-9 (weekend) typically sees lower government-related searches.
3. **No scheduled catalysts:** The 11-day window contains no known OPM-related announcements or events that would reverse the downward trend.

**If timeframe halved (5-6 days):** Would increase confidence in "Decreases" to ~50-55%, as we'd be capturing primarily the news decay phase without time for mean reversion.

**If timeframe doubled (22 days):** Would increase "Doesn't change" probability to ~35-40%, as longer windows allow more mean reversion and the effect of the recent spike would dilute over time.

**(d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View:**

**Outside view baseline:**
- Increases: 35%
- Doesn't change: 28%
- Decreases: 37%

**Inside view adjustments:**

1. **Recent spike context (+10% to Decreases):** The 7-day average drop from 46.6 to 23.7 indicates we just experienced a significant news-driven spike (likely the Jan 30-Feb 3 shutdown period) that is now decaying. Current value of 16 is below even the post-spike 7-day average of 23.7, suggesting continued downward momentum. Historical patterns show post-event decay typically continues for 5-7 days.

2. **Absence of positive catalysts (+5% to Decreases):** No scheduled OPM-related events, policy announcements, or controversies in the Feb 4-15 window. The shutdown is resolved with backpay guaranteed, removing the main driver of recent attention.

3. **Mean reversion ceiling (-3% from Decreases):** Current value (16) is only slightly below the 90-day mean (18.1), so there's limited room for further decline before hitting a natural floor. The term "opm" has a baseline from education/music meanings that provides support.

4. **Volatility considerations (-5% from Doesn't change, +2% to Increases, +3% to Decreases):** The high σ ≈ 14.3 means large swings are common, but given the clear directional momentum (post-spike decay) and absence of catalysts, random volatility is more likely to manifest as continued decline or stabilization rather than a reversal spike.

**Net adjustments:**
- Increases: 35% - 3% = 32% (reduced due to post-spike decay and no catalysts)
- Doesn't change: 28% - 5% = 23% (reduced due to strong directional momentum)
- Decreases: 37% + 10% + 5% - 3% + 3% = 45% (increased due to post-spike decay pattern)

Wait, this doesn't sum to 100%. Let me recalibrate:

Starting from outside view (35/28/37), applying net shifts:
- Strong post-spike decay pattern: +8-10% to Decreases
- No positive catalysts: +3-5% to Decreases  
- Limited downside room: -2-3% from Decreases
- High volatility but directional: -3-5% from Doesn't change, split between others

**Recalibrated:**
- Increases: 35% → 30% (5-point decrease due to lack of catalysts and post-spike environment)
- Doesn't change: 28% → 25% (3-point decrease due to strong directional momentum)
- Decreases: 37% → 45% (8-point increase due to post-spike decay pattern)

**Probability Calibration:**

The most likely outcome is **Decreases (45%)** because:
1. We're in the immediate aftermath of a discrete news event (shutdown) that drove a spike
2. The spike is already declining (7-day avg fell 50%)
3. No catalysts exist to reverse or halt the decline
4. Historical news decay patterns support 5-7 day downward trends post-resolution

**Increases (30%)** remains plausible because:
1. High baseline volatility (σ ≈ 14.3) means random spikes occur
2. Philippine OPM concerts Feb 6-14 could drive searches
3. Unexpected OPM-related news could emerge
4. Mean reversion from 16 toward 18.1 could manifest as a small uptick

**Doesn't change (25%)** is least likely because:
1. Strong directional momentum (post-spike decay) makes staying within ±3 points unlikely
2. The 28% historical base rate for "no change" was calculated across all 90 days, including stable periods; we're currently in a volatile post-event period
3. The current value (16) would need to land at 13-19 on Feb 15, but the decay trajectory suggests either falling below 13 or random volatility pushing it outside this range

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Google Trends US daily value for "opm" on Feb 15 be within ±3 of Feb 4 value (16), >3 higher, or >3 lower?

2. **Base rate alignment:** Started with empirical 35/28/37 from 90-day data, adjusted +8 to Decreases, -5 from Increases, -3 from Doesn't change based on post-spike context.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = Decreases (45%); Least likely = Doesn't change (25%). Makes sense given we're in post-news-spike decay phase with no catalysts.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Shutdown ended Feb 3; post-event decay typically lasts 5-7 days
   - 7-day average already dropped 50% (46.6→23.7)
   - No OPM-related events scheduled Feb 4-15
   - Current value (16) below recent average (23.7), suggesting continued decline
   - High volatility (σ≈14.3) creates uncertainty but directional momentum is clear

5. **Blind spot:** Unexpected OPM-related controversy or policy announcement Feb 5-15 (e.g., new workforce reduction, scandal, major rule change) could spike searches. If this occurred, my forecast would look silly. This scenario would favor "Increases" and is the main risk to the 45% Decreases prediction. Probability of such event: ~15-20%, already partially captured in the 30% Increases allocation.

6. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [30, 25, 45]
