Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis:**

1. **OPM Federal Holidays page** - Official government source explaining OPM's role in federal employee policies. High quality, authoritative. Establishes that OPM (Office of Personnel Management) is a federal agency managing HR for government employees.

2. **OPM Announcements archive (2012-2018)** - Historical archive showing OPM's typical activities. Moderate quality for context but outdated for current prediction.

3. **OPM homepage (2026)** - Current official source showing routine administrative updates. High quality but shows only routine operations with no major announcements scheduled for Feb 4-15.

4. **Government Executive article (Dec 30, 2025)** - Expert analysis of federal workforce issues. High quality journalism. Key factual information: A government shutdown occurred in fall 2025 lasting six weeks; funding for nine appropriations bills expires January 30, 2026; a court provision paused layoffs through January 30. This suggests potential for renewed OPM-related news immediately before our forecast window.

5. **TIME article (Jan 1, 2026)** - Comprehensive reporting on 2025 federal workforce cuts. High quality. Key facts: OPM sent buyout emails to 2 million employees; 150,000+ took buyouts; 212,000 fewer federal employees by early 2026. Establishes OPM as central to major 2025 federal workforce story.

6. **Polymarket resolution (Jan 31, 2026)** - Prediction market that resolved "Yes" for government shutdown by January 31, 2026. High relevance: This confirms a shutdown was officially announced by OPM at or before January 31, just 4 days before our forecast window begins. This is critical factual information about a major OPM-related event immediately preceding our timeframe.

7. **Agent Report** - Identifies one OPM regulatory effective date (Feb 13) and five "Original Pilipino Music" concerts (Feb 6-14). The regulatory event is minor; the music concerts could drive some search interest but are geographically limited to Philippines/diaspora.

8. **Google Trends Data** - Current value: 16 (as of Feb 4, 2026). 90-day mean: 18.1. Recent trend: decreasing (last 7 days avg: 23.7 vs prior 7 days: 46.6). Critical base rate: In 72% of 12-day windows, values changed by >3 points; only 28% stayed within ±3 points.

(b) **Reference Class Analysis:**

Possible reference classes:
1. **Generic 11-day Google Trends changes for "opm"** - Base rate shows 72% probability of change >3 points, 28% of staying within ±3. Most suitable as it's directly derived from historical behavior of this specific search term.

2. **Post-major-news-event decay patterns** - When a significant news event (like a government shutdown) drives search interest, there's typically a spike followed by decay. The Polymarket resolution confirms a shutdown was announced by Jan 31, meaning Feb 4 (today) is already in the decay phase.

3. **Federal agency search patterns around policy deadlines** - The Jan 30 funding/layoff deadline just passed, and we're now in the immediate aftermath period.

**Most suitable reference class:** The generic base rate combined with post-event decay analysis, given we have both historical data and knowledge of a major triggering event (shutdown announcement) that just occurred.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis:**

- **Prediction timeframe:** 11 days (Feb 4 to Feb 15, 2026)
- **Current position:** Feb 4 is day 0; we need to predict the value on Feb 15 (day 11)
- **Recent pattern:** Value declined from 46.6 (7-14 days ago) to 23.7 (last 7 days) to 16 (today). This represents a steep decline following what was likely the shutdown announcement peak.
- **Historical volatility:** Standard deviation of 14.3 against a mean of 18.1 indicates high volatility (coefficient of variation ~79%)

(d) **Justification:**

The current value of 16 is below the 90-day mean of 18.1, and we're clearly in a declining phase following the government shutdown announcement (confirmed by Polymarket to have occurred by Jan 31). The question is whether this decline will continue, stabilize, or reverse over the next 11 days.

**Factors favoring "Decreases":**
- Strong recent downward momentum (46.6 → 23.7 → 16)
- Typical post-news-event decay pattern
- No major OPM-related events scheduled Feb 4-15 except a minor regulatory effective date (Feb 13)
- The immediate crisis (shutdown, Jan 30 deadline) has passed

**Factors favoring "Doesn't change":**
- Current value (16) is close to the long-term mean (18.1), suggesting potential stabilization
- Base rate shows only 28% probability of staying within ±3 points
- Value could oscillate around current level

**Factors favoring "Increases":**
- Potential ongoing shutdown-related news or developments
- Feb 13 regulatory effective date (minor impact expected)
- Original Pilipino Music concerts could add marginal search volume
- Historical volatility means reversals are possible

The base rate of 72% for changes >3 points is critical. Given the strong downward momentum and typical post-crisis decay patterns, a continued decrease seems most likely. However, the proximity to the mean suggests we might be approaching a floor.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate (72% change >3 points, 28% stable) provides our starting anchor. However, this needs calibration based on:

1. **Directional momentum:** The recent trend is strongly downward. When values are declining, they tend to continue declining until reaching a baseline. Given we've dropped from 46.6 to 16 in ~2 weeks, we're likely still in decay phase.

2. **Distance from baseline:** Current value (16) is slightly below mean (18.1) but within one standard deviation. This suggests we're approaching but haven't necessarily reached the floor.

3. **Event calendar:** The absence of major scheduled OPM events Feb 4-15 supports continued decline or stability rather than increase.

4. **Uncertainty adjustment:** While momentum suggests decrease, the high historical volatility (SD=14.3) means unexpected reversals occur. The 72% change rate includes both increases and decreases.

Splitting the 72% "change" probability between increases and decreases based on momentum and context:
- Strong downward momentum suggests ~60% of the change probability should be allocated to decreases
- Remaining ~12% to increases (accounting for volatility and potential news)
- 28% to no change (base rate)

This yields approximately: Decreases 60%, Doesn't change 28%, Increases 12%.

However, given the extreme recent decline and proximity to mean, there's risk of mean reversion, so I'll slightly increase the "Doesn't change" probability and moderately reduce "Decreases":

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 15%
Doesn't change: 32%
Decreases: 53%
