Analysis (abridged – see checklist for cross-checks)

(a) Source analysis (salient items only)
1. GovExec 2 & 3 Feb 2026 – Factual, well-sourced reporting on the four-day government shutdown and OPM back-pay guidance flip-flop. Quality high; confirms OPM was in the headlines 31 Jan–3 Feb.
2. PoPville 28 Jan 2026 – Routine “operating status” alert. High factual quality but small reach; mild relevance (weather closings can bump searches).
3. GovExec events calendar (Feb 4-15) – Lists D.C. gov-focused conferences; none explicitly about OPM. Low relevance.
4. Other Asknews items (ECB, shrimp tariffs, Bitcoin, etc.) – Contain the string “OPM” only as an acronym for “other people’s money” or are unrelated. Low relevance.
Net: only the shutdown stories give strong, recent, U.S.-centric search drivers.

(b) Evidence weighting
• Strong: Shutdown ended 3 Feb ⇒ attention spike has just passed; Google Trends for “opm” typically surges during shutdowns and falls quickly afterwards (historical pattern).
• Moderate: Current daily value is 16 (near the 20-day low) after a 7-day average of 23.7 vs 46.6 the week before, illustrating the decay.
• Weak-to-moderate: Possible 13 Feb DHS funding brinkmanship could renew headlines, but OPM is fully funded and unlikely to lead the story.
• Weak: Weather status bulletins (e.g., snow) can lift DC searches, but require a storm; forecast models (as of 4 Feb) show only light precipitation.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Forecast window = 11 days. If the window were halved (to ~5 d) I’d raise “no change” by ~5 pts because there’s less time for drift; if doubled I’d raise “decrease” by ~7 pts (longer decay).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments
Outside-view base rates (last 90 d, 12-day windows): 27 Incr / 29 NC / 44 Decr.
Current factors tilt further toward Decrease:
1. Fresh post-spike mean-reversion usually runs ~10-14 days ⇒ value of 16 can easily slide ≤12.
2. Lack of scheduled OPM-centric events before 15 Feb reduces rebound odds.
3. Threshold band (±3) is narrow; random noise alone yields ~30 % “no change,” so keep that near base.

Probability calibration
• Increase kept lower than base because no clear catalyst (+3 pts requires ≥20).
• Decrease lifted modestly due to decay momentum and low starting point.
• No-change left near historical 30 % as day-to-day noise could keep the index 13-19.

Checklist (condensed)
1. Criteria: Compare U.S. GT daily value for “opm” on 15 Feb vs 4 Feb; >+3 = Increase, |≤3| = Same, <-3 = Decrease.
2. Base: 27/29/44.
3. Consistency: Most likely = Decrease, least = Increase – matches narrative.
4. Key evidence: (i) Shutdown ended 3 Feb, (ii) GT value now 16 after 46 peak, (iii) no major OPM news slated, (iv) 11-day decay typical, (v) snow risk low.
5. Blind spot: Surprise DHS shutdown drama or viral OPM (Original Pilipino Music) meme boosting U.S. searches; would shift probability toward Increase.
6. Probabilities sum to 100, between 0-100.

Probabilities: [22, 30, 48]
