Analysis
(a) Source analysis (abridged to the few items plausibly germane to Google-search demand for “opm” between 4 Feb – 15 Feb 2026)

1. GovExec trio of 2 Feb – 3 Feb articles (partial-shutdown begins, furloughs, bill signed).  
   • Highly reliable niche outlet covering the federal workforce.  
   • Purely factual reporting, little opinion.  
   • Relevance: puts “OPM” in national headlines 1-3 days before our start date – a likely spike driver.

2. PoPville 28 Jan DC operating-status note.  
   • Local blog, routine notice.  
   • Minor, but illustrates typical “snow-day = OPM search” pattern.

3. Event calendars (GovExec events page, NASWA forum).  
   • Factual schedules; none mention OPM; negligible direct impact.

4. Asknews scrape – no additional items link OPM to new, high-salience stories inside the 4 Feb-15 Feb window.

Quality: All sources are factual, dated within the past week, and come from outlets with track-records for accuracy (GovExec, PoPville). None are speculative opinion pieces.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong evidence: none.

Moderate evidence:  
• Recent shutdown coverage (multiple independent articles) – historically drives short-lived surges in “opm” queries as employees seek guidance. Directional implication: 4 Feb value is probably still somewhat elevated, biasing future change toward Decrease.  

Weak evidence:  
• Potential new DHS funding drama on/after 13 Feb could renew coverage but is uncertain and not agency-wide; effect could go either way.  
• Typical DC winter storms sometimes trigger OPM status alerts, but no forecast yet – symmetric risk.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Prediction horizon = 11 days.  Halving this (5-6 days) would give even higher volatility; doubling (22 days) would shrink noise as multiple ups/downs mean-revert, nudging “Doesn’t change” upward by perhaps +5 pp.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
Outside-view base (last 90 daily windows):  
Increases 36 / Doesn’t change 28 / Decreases 36.

Adjustments:  
1. Mean-reversion logic: shutdown-induced attention likely raised searches in late Jan–early Feb; 4 Feb reading (16) sits slightly below 90-day mean (18) but headlines only just cooled. Net: mild downward pull → +4 pp to Decrease.  
2. Possibility of fresh news (DHS deadline, weather) gives some upside tail; subtract 3 pp from Increase rather than Decrease.  
3. Residual uncertainty redistributed to “Doesn’t change” (-1 pp).

Probability calibration
Final probabilities after ±4 pp swing remain close to base rates and sum to 100.

Checklist
1. Options: 15 Feb value vs 4 Feb; > +3 = Increase, ±3 = No change, < –3 = Decrease.  
2. Base: 36/28/36.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = Decrease, Least likely = Doesn’t change – matches mean-reversion argument.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Shutdown articles 2-3 Feb spiked interest.  
   • 4 Feb reading only slightly below mean.  
   • No scheduled OPM-centric events 4-15 Feb.  
   • Typical weather alerts possible but unconfirmed.  
5. Blind spot: Major snowstorm or another federal-pay headline around 10-12 Feb could push searches sharply up, making Increase dominant.  
6. Probabilities numeric, sum = 100.

Probabilities: [33, 27, 40]
