Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. OPM Federal-holiday rules page (official, last updated in 2025).  Purely factual; tells us when OPM normally gets attention (around holiday closures).  No direct data on search volumes.  
2. Historical OPM “Announcements & News” archive (2012-2018).  Old, descriptive, low relevance to February 2026 search behaviour.  
3. OPM home-page snippet (2026).  Mentions routine HR guidance.  Credible but unlikely to cause national search spikes.  
4. Government Executive 30 Dec 2025 article.  Journalist summary of likely 2026 civil-service story-lines.  Some informed opinion but dated 5 weeks ago; any Google-interest surge it generated would already be reflected in current Trends data.  
5. TIME 1 Jan 2026 article on government cuts.  Similar to (4).  One-month-old; impact, if any, already baked into today’s Trends baseline.  
6. Polymarket market (resolved “Yes” to a shutdown by 31 Jan 2026).  Factual, confirms that a shutdown announcement occurred a few days ago – plausibly the cause of the elevated “opm” searches seen in late January.  
7. Agent-report event list.  Identifies one OPM regulatory effective date (13 Feb) and five “Original Pilipino Music” concerts (6-14 Feb).  All factual, but for an outside-view forecast we set them aside and look only at historical data.  
8. GoogleTrendsData object.  Machine-pulled daily U.S. series, last 90 days.  Current index 16; 90-day mean 18.1; s.d. 14.3.  The same data show that in the past 90 days, 28 % of rolling 11-day windows changed by ≤ ±3, implying 72 % exceeded the ±3 threshold that decides this question.  This is the only numerically rich, high-value source for the base rate.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Possible classes:  
• Any 11-day window for the term “opm” (same geography, past 2–3 years).  
• 11-day windows for comparable U.S. agency acronyms (“cdc”, “irs”, “fema”) over the past few years.  
• Generic one-word search terms of similar baseline popularity.  
The first class is the narrowest, requires no heroic assumptions, and yields a directly observed base rate.  I therefore select “opm” 11-day windows as the reference class.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Forecast horizon: 11 calendar days (4 Feb → 15 Feb 2026).  
Within the last 90 days we have 79 such windows.  Empirical frequencies:  
• |Δ| ≤ 3 pts (“Doesn’t change”): 22 / 79 ≈ 28 %  
• |Δ| > 3 pts: 57 / 79 ≈ 72 %  
We do not have the split of +Δ vs –Δ inside the 57 cases; lacking evidence of systematic drift, a 50/50 split is a reasonable first approximation.

(d) Justification  
1. Google Trends indices for low-volume terms like “opm” are noisy; swings of ≥4 points over 11 days are more common than not (72 %).  
2. The current reading (16) sits only 0.15 standard deviations below the 90-day mean – essentially “typical.”  No strong reversion-to-mean signal.  
3. Absent a directional prior, the + Δ and – Δ tails are treated symmetrically.  
4. Fat-tail risk: unusual news could still move searches sharply in either direction; historically, these surprises already appear in the 72 % “movement” bucket, so no additional premium is required at the outside-view stage.

Outside view calibration:

Base probabilities derived directly from the 90-day sample:  
• Doesn’t change ≈ 28 %  
• Increases ≈ 36 %  
• Decreases ≈ 36 %  

Small sample (n = 79) adds ±6 pp sampling error (95 % CI) to any single proportion, so rounding to whole percentages retains appropriate humility.  No evidence suggests skewing those numbers yet; therefore I stay very close to the raw base rate while keeping the three figures summing to 100 %.

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 36%  
Doesn't change: 28%  
Decreases: 36%
