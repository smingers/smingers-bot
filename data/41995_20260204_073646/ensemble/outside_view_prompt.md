You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “opm” change between 2026-02-04 and 2026-02-15 according to Google Trends?

The options are: ['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves “Doesn't change” if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=opm&date=2026-01-16%202026-02-15](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=opm&date=2026-01-16%202026-02-15) for 2026-02-15 is within 3 of the value at 2026-02-04. It resolves “Increases” if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves “Decreases” if the value is more than 3 lower.

<Summary source="https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/pay-leave/federal-holidays/">
# Summary of Article: Federal Holidays (U.S. Office of Personnel Management)

**Source:** U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM)

## Key Facts:

1. **Legal Basis:** Federal holidays are established by federal law (5 U.S.C. 6103) for Federal employees.

2. **Holiday Observation Rules:**
   - Most Federal employees work Monday through Friday
   - When a holiday falls on Saturday: the preceding Friday is treated as a holiday for pay and leave purposes (5 U.S.C. 6103(b))
   - When a holiday falls on Sunday: the following Monday is treated as a holiday for pay and leave purposes (Executive Order 11582, February 11, 1971)

3. **Specific Holiday Notes:**
   - "Washington's Birthday" is the official designation in law (section 6103(a) of title 5), though other institutions may use different names
   - "Inauguration Day" (section 6103(c)) applies to Federal employees in the Washington, DC area on January 20th for each fourth year after 1965
   - Special case noted: Inauguration Day, January 20, 2029, falls on a Saturday - only employees scheduled to work that Saturday may be excused; there is no in-lieu-of holiday for employees not regularly scheduled to work on Inauguration Day

4. **Holiday Premium Pay:** Employees required to work on a holiday are entitled to holiday premium pay

## Relevance to Forecasting Question:

This article is from the official OPM website explaining federal holiday policies. The acronym "OPM" stands for U.S. Office of Personnel Management. Any federal holiday announcements, policy changes, or government operations affecting federal employees during the period of February 4-15, 2026 could potentially drive search interest in "opm."

# Summary of "The 5 biggest stories federal agencies and employees need to watch in 2026"

**Source:** Government Executive  
**Date:** December 30, 2025

## Key Facts and Information:

### Workforce Changes:
- More than 300,000 federal employees left government in 2025, mostly through incentivized programs rather than layoffs
- Agencies have begun notifying thousands of employees that their previously scheduled reductions in force are rescinded (for now)
- Cutting the federal workforce remains a priority for the Trump administration and is a pillar of the president's management agenda

### Five Major Issues for 2026:

**1. Renewed Shutdown Watch:**
- Nine of twelve annual appropriations bills for fiscal 2026 remain unpassed
- Funding for remaining agencies set to expire January 30, 2026
- A provision passed when Congress voted to end the previous shutdown paused any agency layoff action through January 30
- A federal court has intervened to enforce this provision
- The previous shutdown was record-setting, began in October, and lasted six weeks

**2. Workforce Reductions (implied as #2, though not explicitly numbered):**
- Agencies expected to continue limiting hiring
- Could tap additional programs to push employees to leave in 2026
- Agencies will reassess layoff plans after the January 30 deadline

**3. Schedule F/Schedule Career/Policy Implementation:**
- Trump's "Schedule F" order from his first term will be revived in 2026 as "Schedule Career/Policy"
- A proposed rule was put forward; the final version has been drafted and circulated to agencies
- Release expected imminently
- The regulations will cite "accountability to the president" as grounds for stripping tens of thousands of federal employees of their civil service protections (according to excerpts reviewed by Government Executive)
- Converted employees would become effectively at-will employees
- Agencies recently turned over lists to OPM for employees to convert
- OPM will soon put forward proposals on overhauling the layoff process and implementing a "forced distribution" system for performance management

**4. Agency Reorganizations:**
- Agriculture Department: relocating thousands of employees and shuttering offices
- State Department: shed employees and reshaped entire organizational chart
- Interior Department: consolidating employees away from bureaus into the Office of the Secretary
- Education Department: unloading key operations onto other agencies, expected to move employees
- Consumer Financial Protection Bureau: shifting work and looking to essentially dismantle itself entirely
- Veterans Affairs Department: announced overhaul of health care network, looking to slash regional offices but maintain current staffing levels

**5. Legal Battles:**
- Trump administration facing pending litigation over layoff efforts
- Dozen preliminary injunctions against efforts to strip most federal employees of collective bargaining rights (in various states of appeal)
- House passed a bipartisan measure to undo Trump's collective bargaining actions
- Legal challenges to efforts to dismantle CFPB, Education Department, USAID, and others
- Lawsuits over White House withholding federal funds appropriated by Congress

## Context:
The article notes that the Trump administration "rapidly launched efforts to overhaul the federal government and upend the norms of the civil service" but that "what the new steady state of the civil service will look like remains unknown."

**Note:** This article focuses on federal workforce and agency issues. "OPM" in this context refers to the Office of Personnel Management, mentioned in relation to Schedule Career/Policy implementation and having final say on employee conversion decisions.

# Summary of "Trump's Year of Government Cuts—and What Lies Ahead"

**Source:** TIME  
**Date:** January 01, 2026  
**Author:** Connor Greene

## Key Facts and Statistics:

### Federal Workforce Reductions:
- **Office of Personnel Management (OPM)** sent an email on January 28 to roughly 2 million federal employees offering a Deferred Resignation Program with full pay and benefits through Sept. 30, 2025
- More than 150,000 federal workers took buyouts according to OPM
- Tens of thousands of others were laid off, including several thousand during a government shutdown in the fall
- The Partnership for Public Service estimates the federal government is entering 2026 with around **212,000 fewer employees** (roughly 9% of the civilian federal workforce of about 2.3 million workers)
- OPM Director Scott Kupor projected 317,000 federal employees would have been shed by year's end, with 68,000 workers hired in 2025

### Agencies Most Affected by Staff Reductions:
- **Defense Department:** Lost more than 60,000 employees
- **Treasury Department:** Lost more than 30,000 employees
- **Department of Agriculture:** Lost more than 20,000 employees
- These three agencies account for more than half of total staff reductions in 2025

### Inspectors General:
- Trump fired at least 17 inspectors general just days into his second term
- There are 74 inspectors general total in the federal government
- More than a quarter of watchdogs have been removed from their posts since Trump returned to office
- U.S. District Judge Ana C. Reyes ruled in September that the dismissals "obviously" violated the law

### Foreign Aid:
- The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) was shut down, terminating over 5,000 contracts
- A study published in The Lancet forecasted the shuttering could lead to roughly **14 million additional deaths by 2030**, including 4.5 million among children and infants below age 5
- The Supreme Court in September allowed Trump to withhold over $4 billion in relief funds approved by Congress
- Trump signed a rescissions package rolling back about $7 billion in previously approved foreign aid funding

### Health Agencies:
- **CDC:** Roughly 24% of employees had been laid off as of October 2025
- **HHS restructuring:** Plan to reduce workforce from 82,000 to 62,000 (cutting 20,000 full-time jobs, including 2,400 at CDC)
- HHS cancelled around $12 billion in COVID-era federal grants to local and state health agencies in March

## Named Source Opinions:
- **Fatema Sumar** (adjunct lecturer in public policy at Harvard University's Kennedy School): Described "an institutional breakdown" with destruction of supply chains for medical equipment, vaccinations, and food supplies; noted hardest hit countries include Ukraine, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, and Syria
- **Dr. Angela Rasmussen** (virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan): Stated the CDC was "not functional" and "cannot carry out any of its mission. America has no national public health agency any more"

## Context:
The article describes how President Trump's second term, beginning in January 2025, featured sweeping federal workforce cuts, agency restructuring, and funding reductions. The Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE), led by Elon Musk, spearheaded mass buyouts and layoffs, though DOGE itself was later quietly slashed. **OPM** is specifically mentioned as taking on DOGE's responsibilities after November 2025.

# Summary of Polymarket Article on US Government Shutdown

## Key Facts:

1. **Market Details:**
   - Trading volume: $157,296,576
   - End date: January 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET
   - Market created: November 13, 2025, 9:58 AM ET

2. **Resolution Criteria:**
   - The market resolves to "Yes" if the U.S. Office of Personnel Management (OPM) announces a federal government shutdown due to a lapse in appropriations by January 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET
   - Otherwise resolves to "No"
   - Partial shutdowns count as shutdowns
   - Office closures due to holidays or inclement weather do NOT qualify as a shutdown

3. **Resolution Source:**
   - OPM's Operating Status page (https://www.opm.gov/policy-data-oversight/snow-dismissal-procedures/current-status/)

4. **Final Outcome:**
   - The market shows "Final outcome: Yes" (indicating a shutdown was announced)
   - The outcome was initially "proposed: Yes" and was "Disputed" before reaching the final resolution

## Relevance to Forecasting Question:

This article indicates that there was a U.S. government shutdown announced by or before January 31, 2026. This event would likely drive significant search interest in "OPM" (Office of Personnel Management) around late January/early February 2026, which could impact Google Trends values during the period in question (February 4-15, 2026). The high trading volume ($157M+) suggests this was a significant event with substantial public attention.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve 90-day US Google Trends daily values for “opm”; compute distribution of 11-day changes ≥±4; list any scheduled events 4–15 Feb 2026 that mention OPM or “Original Pilipino Music.”
The original request has three parts.  The new search results allow us to reassess what is finished, add a few details on scheduled events, and confirm what is still missing.

PART A – 90-day U S Google Trends daily values for the search term “opm”  
• No page returned by today’s searches publishes the actual day-by-day index that Google Trends generates.  
• The data therefore still have to be downloaded directly from the Trends interface (or retrieved with a small Python/R script that calls the same endpoint).  A public web search will not surface the CSV; Google does not post that file anywhere that can be indexed.  
Status:  Data themselves are still missing.

PART B – Distribution of 11-day changes ≥ +4 or ≤ –4 index points  
• Because the daily series is not yet in hand, the Δ11 calculations cannot be run.  
• Once the CSV from Part A is available, the procedure remains straightforward: create a lag-11 column and count the rows where the change is ≥ +4 and where it is ≤ –4, then divide each count by (N-11) to obtain the frequencies.  
Status:  Still pending the same missing input series.

PART C – Any scheduled events between 4 Feb 2026 and 15 Feb 2026 that mention either  
 (i) the U.S. Office of Personnel Management or  
 (ii) “Original Pilipino Music” / “OPM”

C-1.  References to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management

1.  Final Rule on Recruitment & Relocation Incentive Waivers – effective 13 Feb 2026.  
    • This rule was published 17 Dec 2025; the effective date itself occurs inside the target window, so the “event” is the rule taking effect.

2.  No Federal Register notices dated 4–15 Feb 2026 announce OPM-sponsored meetings, webinars, or comment periods.  The only new document located is a withdrawal of a proposed FEHB rule published 3 Feb 2026, which falls just outside the window (Federal Register, 3 Feb 2026).

3.  The OPM “Published Memos” list shows a Chief Human Capital Officers memorandum dated 3 Feb 2026 on pay, leave and benefits during a partial lapse in appropriations—which again sits outside the 4–15 Feb range (OPM Published Memos page).

Conclusion:  The sole qualifying OPM-agency event inside the window remains the rule’s effective date on 13 Feb 2026.

C-2.  References to OPM meaning “Original Pilipino Music”

All of the following concerts explicitly brand themselves as OPM shows or showcase artists universally recognised as OPM performers; all fall within 4–15 Feb 2026.

1.  TJ Monterde & KZ Tandingan – “In Between” Back-to-Back Concert  
    • 6–7 Feb 2026, Smart Araneta Coliseum, Quezon City.

2.  Cup of Joe – “STARDUST” Philippine Tour opening night  
    • 6 Feb 2026, Baguio City.

3.  Wolfgang – “The Reunion” Concert  
    • 7 Feb 2026, New Frontier Theater, Quezon City.

4.  “Champions of the Heart” Valentine’s OPM Concert (Martin Nievera, Jed Madela, Jona, etc.)  
    • 14 Feb 2026, Marriott Grand Ballroom, Newport World Resorts, Pasay.

5.  Cup of Joe – International tour date  
    • 14 Feb 2026, Doha, Qatar (still marketed as an OPM show).

These five concerts, plus the single OPM-agency regulatory effective date, complete the event list.

WHAT HAS BEEN FULLY ANSWERED  
• Part C:  A total of six qualifying events have been identified—one U.S. Office of Personnel Management regulatory milestone on 13 Feb 2026 and five “Original Pilipino Music” concerts between 6 Feb and 14 Feb 2026.

WHAT REMAINS OUTSTANDING  
• The actual 90-day United States daily Google Trends series for “opm”.  
• The derived distribution of 11-day changes ≥ ±4 index points.

WHY ADDITIONAL WEB SEARCHING WON’T HELP  
Google does not expose day-level Trends data in any indexable web page, only via on-demand CSV download from the Trends site.  No third-party site indexed by today’s search results hosts a copy of that CSV.  Therefore the missing numeric series cannot be found by further searching; it has to be pulled directly from Google Trends (manually or via script).  Once that is done, Part B can be completed locally in a spreadsheet or statistical notebook in a matter of minutes.

RECOMMENDED NEXT ACTIONS  
1.  Go to trends.google.com, set  
    • search term = opm  
    • geography = United States  
    • time range = Past 90 days  
    then click the Download (CSV) icon and save the file.  
    (If you prefer code, any of the public “Google Trends daily downloader” Python notebooks will replicate the same call.)

2.  Import the CSV, create a column Δ11 = value(t) – value(t-11), and count the rows where Δ11 ≥ +4 and where Δ11 ≤ –4; divide by (N – 11) to produce the requested distribution.

3.  If absolute certainty is required that OPM holds no public meetings between 4 Feb and 15 Feb 2026, run a quick follow-up search directly inside the Federal Register for “Office of Personnel Management meeting February 2026”.  Current evidence suggests none exist, but that check could definitively close the matter.

Until the CSV in Step 1 is downloaded, no amount of additional web research will close the remaining quantitative gap; the information simply is not published anywhere else.

The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?

Format you answer as below:
