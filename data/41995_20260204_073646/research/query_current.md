Analysis:
To gauge whether Google searches for the term “opm” are likely to rise or fall, the key is identifying any forthcoming or ongoing events that could spur extra public interest. “OPM” most often refers to the U.S. Office of Personnel Management; spikes typically follow security-breach revelations, major policy changes (e.g., retirement, pay tables), federal hiring initiatives, or litigation/settlement deadlines. Another possible meaning is “One-Punch Man” (anime/manga) or “Original Pilipino Music,” but U.S. news coverage and search volumes skew heavily toward the federal agency. Therefore, I will look for:
• Scheduled announcements, rulemakings, or reports from OPM between Feb 4–15 2026.  
• Cybersecurity or data-breach updates, lawsuit milestones, or congressional hearings involving OPM.  
• Pop-culture releases or tour dates if “OPM” is being used in another sense.  

Finding any such triggers will help judge whether search interest (Google Trends value) is apt to move more than three points over the period.
