Analysis:
The question asks whether the Google Trends “interest over time” value for the search term “opm” in the United States will move more than ±3 points between 4 Feb 2026 and 15 Feb 2026.  To judge this we need:  
1. A base-rate for daily volatility in the “opm” series.  Ninety-day Google Trends data will tell us how often a ≥4-point swing occurs over 11-day intervals.  
2. Any scheduled or likely news/events in the coming two weeks that could plausibly spike or depress “opm” searches—e.g. U.S. Office of Personnel Management policy announcements, a data breach, a new “Original Pilipino Music” release, or headlines about “other people’s money.”  
If historical volatility is usually ≤3 points and no major event is expected, “Doesn’t change” is more likely.  Conversely, if the series is jumpy or a big event is forthcoming, “Increases” or “Decreases” becomes plausible.
