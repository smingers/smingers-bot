James Walkinshaw (D-Va.) reintroduced the True Shutdown Fairness Act to ensure all federal workers and contractors are paid on time during any lapse in appropriations through September 30, and to bar agencies from initiating reductions in force during shutdowns.\n\n## Named Source Opinion:\n\n**Rep.

This change is interpreted as a compromise influenced by considerations of North Korea relations. While the military claims the move aims to maximize training efficiency by spreading schedules across the year, analysts suggest it effectively reduces the intensity and scale of exercises, potentially easing tensions with North Korea. The decision follows a shift from the Moon Jae-in administration's reduced exercise policy after the 9.19 Military Agreement to the Yoon Suk-yeol administration's expansion of large-scale maneuvers during Ulchi Freedom Shield (UFS). Analysts, including Senior Research Fellow Jo Han-beom of the Korea Institute for National Unification, argue this reflects a convergence of the incoming Lee Jae-myung administration's desire to reduce tensions with North Korea and U.S. President Donald Trump's interest in engaging with North Korean leader Kim Jong-un. The main Freedom Shield exercise is scheduled for March 9\u201319, with a Crisis Management Exercise (CMX) preceding it from March 3\u20136. The military maintains that the timing of the main exercise cannot be delayed due to the ongoing push for transfer of wartime operational control (OPCON) by 2028, a key goal tied to the establishment of a future combined command. The U.S. and South Korea agreed at the November 2025 Security Consultative Meeting (SCM) to complete the second phase of verification\u2014Full Operational Capability (FOC)\u2014by November 2026, with the final phase to be completed by the end of 2026. The 2028 target year for OPCON transfer remains highly likely.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 06:28 AM\nSource:[\uacbd\ud5a5\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.khan.co.kr/article/202602041528021)\n\n**Euro-Zone Faces Inflation Hurdle Ahead of ECB Decision**\nThe eurozone is approaching a key inflation hurdle ahead of the European Central Bank's (ECB) interest rate decision, with preliminary January inflation data expected to shape market sentiment. Markets anticipate a slight drop in annual consumer prices to 1.7%, well below the ECB\u2019s 2% target, signaling subdued price pressure and supporting expectations of unchanged interest rates. Recent data showed Germany\u2019s inflation rose unexpectedly in January, while France\u2019s inflation fell short of forecasts. A significant downward surprise could trigger alarm among ECB policymakers, who previously expressed concern over the euro\u2019s rapid appreciation against the dollar\u2014potentially further suppressing inflation if the trend continues. Although the euro has retreated from its January highs above 1.20 USD, it remains sensitive to uncertainty stemming from U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s chaotic policies, which continue to weigh on the dollar. In the equity markets, selling pressure in data analytics, professional services, and software sectors persists, driven by concerns over AI-driven disruption following Anthropic\u2019s launch of Claude Cowork Agent plug-ins. However, the selloff has eased in Asia, where manufacturing remains historically dominant, while European and U.S. stock index futures point to a more stable trading start. Analysts note this shift is clarifying the divide between true AI winners and losers in a previously broad-based rally. Alphabet (Google\u2019s parent company) is also expected to report a 15.5% revenue increase to $111.37 billion in January, with investor focus on its 2026 investment plans, cloud demand outlook, and updates on AI capacity constraints. Key events influencing markets on Wednesday include the eurozone\u2019s preliminary inflation data and the U.S. ADP private sector employment report for January.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 06:26 AM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/euro-zone-steht-vor-inflationshuerde-vor-ezb-entscheidung-ce7e5bd3de8ef72d)\n\n**DEADLINE ALERT: Faruqi & Faruqi, LLP Investigates Claims on Behalf of Investors of SLM ...**\nFaruqi & Faruqi, LLP, a national securities law firm, is investigating potential claims against SLM Corporation (SLM) related to alleged false and misleading statements made by the company and its executives between July 25, 2025, and August 14, 2025. The complaint alleges that SLM misrepresented its financial health by failing to disclose a significant increase in early-stage delinquencies, overstating the effectiveness of its loss mitigation and loan modification programs, and misrepresenting the stability of its PEL delinquency rates. This deception allegedly created a materially false and misleading impression about SLM\u2019s business, operations, and prospects. The investigation was prompted by a report from TD Cowen on August 14, 2025, which revealed that July 2025 delinquencies rose 49 basis points month-over-month\u2014significantly worse than the expected seasonal increase of 10 basis points\u2014driven by a 45-basis-point rise in early-stage delinquencies. This directly contradicted statements made by Defendant Graham in late July 2025, who claimed delinquency rates were following normal seasonal trends. Following the TD Cowen report, SLM\u2019s stock price dropped $2.67, or 8.09%, closing at $30.32 per share on August 15, 2025. The court-appointed lead plaintiff must be an investor with the largest financial interest in the relief sought and must be adequate and typical of the class. Investors who purchased or acquired SLM securities during the specified period are encouraged to contact Faruqi & Faruqi partner James (Josh) Wilson at 877-247-4292 or 212-983-9330 (Ext. 1310) by the February 17, 2026 deadline to discuss their legal rights. The firm also invites whistleblowers, former employees, and other individuals with relevant information to come forward. All communications are confidential. The firm has recovered hundreds of millions of dollars for investors since 1995.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 06:21 AM\nSource:[GuruFocus.com](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/8579322/deadline-alert-faruqi-faruqi-llp-investigates-claims-on-behalf-of-investors-of-slm-corporation)\n\n**Bank Credit 'Opening Red' Strong, Net Interest Margin Stabilizing, Sector May Be Prime for Investment**\nDuring the current peak marketing season for banks, institutional investors continue to conduct research on listed banks, focusing primarily on credit disbursement during this period. Multiple banks report that their corporate credit disbursement during the 'opening red' season has outperformed the same period in 2025, indicating strong performance. Institutions are also closely monitoring banks' asset allocation and funding costs. Given that net interest margin (NIM) is a key indicator of banking performance, stabilizing NIM through measures on both asset and liability sides has become a core focus. Regarding asset quality, several banks state that improvements in new loan quality and increased efforts in non-performing loan resolution will help maintain overall stability in asset quality through 2026. Additionally, a researcher from the Postal Savings Bank of China Research Institute notes that reduced funding costs in 2026 are expected to ease the downward pressure on NIM, suggesting the industry may stabilize and bottom out.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 06:07 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202602043641339975.html)\n\n**ANALYSIS - Today in Global Markets (FNC-NEWS)**\nU.S. stock indices ended the day with weak performance, as selling pressure in technology stocks weighed on overall market results. Software stocks declined notably, with growing concerns that advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) could threaten their market share. Investors will closely monitor the upcoming earnings reports from Alphabet (parent company of Google) today and Amazon tomorrow, particularly regarding their AI investment trends. While technology stocks showed a weak trend, energy, raw materials, basic consumer goods, and public services performed positively. Alphabet is expected to report strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter, driven by AI initiatives supporting advertising activities and rising cloud computing revenues due to the rapid adoption of AI. Investors will be watching for updates on 2026 spending plans, demand expectations for cloud services, and capacity constraints in AI infrastructure.

On the macroeconomic front, the U.S. ISM Services Index is expected to decline to 53.5 in January, signaling moderate economic slowdown, while the ADP private sector employment report is forecasted to show a 45,000-job increase in January.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 04:05 AM\nSource:[Uzmanpara.com](https://uzmanpara.milliyet.com.tr/raporlar-analizler/analiz--yurt-disi-piyasalarda-bugun-unlu---co--daha-fnc-news/3412018/)\n\n**Which products Americans are searching amid India-US trade deal**\nFollowing U.S. President Donald Trump's announcement on February 3, 2026, to reduce reciprocal tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18% in exchange for India halting Russian oil purchases and lowering trade barriers, American online search interest in shrimp and prawns surged. According to India Today's OSINT analysis and Google Trends data, search activity for 'shrimp' and 'prawns' spiked notably during key tariff-related events: the initial August 2025 tariff hike announcement, a December 2025 surge linked to U.S.-India trade delegation meetings (which overlapped with the Thanksgiving and Christmas holiday season, when shrimp dishes are popular), and a renewed spike after the February 2026 tariff reduction. More than 90% of U.S. shrimp consumption is imported, with India being the world\u2019s second-largest shrimp exporter\u2014after Ecuador\u2014and accounting for approximately 48% of its $500 crore in frozen shrimp exports to the U.S. in the financial year ending March 2025. The tariff cut led to a sharp rebound in stocks of major Indian seafood exporters, including Avanti Feeds, Apex Frozen Foods, and Coastal Corporation, which had previously suffered under tariff-related pressure. Among India\u2019s top exports to the U.S., seafood ranks after textiles, smartphones, gems and jewellery, auto components, carpets, and engineering goods, with pharmaceuticals, smartphones, and energy products currently exempt from tariffs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 02:45 PM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/business/story/which-products-americans-searching-amid-india-us-trade-deal-indian-exports-trump-tariffs-2862581-2026-02-03)\n\n**'No Stock Code, But a Report Card': How Data Firms Are Transforming Private Startup Valuations**\nGlobal non-public startups such as DataBricks, valued at $134 billion (approximately 190 trillion KRW), are receiving performance evaluations comparable to public companies through CB Insights' 'Mosaic Score' system, despite lacking stock ticker symbols. Investors use these scores to assess fair valuation and trade existing shares in secondary markets at high prices. According to CB Insights' '2026 Tech Trends' report, the market for data-driven analysis of non-public tech startups\u2014including OpenAI, SpaceX, and Anthropic\u2014is rapidly expanding. Unlike public firms, non-public companies are not subject to mandatory disclosure requirements, and historically, key information was shared only through private networks. Now, data such as hiring trends, web traffic, payment metrics, API usage, GitHub code updates, and technology stacks are being actively leveraged for analysis. For example, hiring for roles like 'NVIDIA H100 server administrators' or 'PyTorch optimization experts' signals a potential upcoming launch of a large language model (LLM)-based service. According to industry insiders, job postings serve as leading indicators of future investment priorities, unlike financial statements that reflect past performance. The movement of top-tier talent\u2014such as core developers from OpenAI or PhD-level researchers from Google DeepMind\u2014to startups often triggers early investor interest. One Silicon Valley VC stated, 'Financial statements can be manipulated, but talent movement does not lie.' Other signals include changes in API call volume, GitHub commit frequency, and the number of websites using specific tools. Companies like Intructle collect global cloud and application traffic data, while BulletWid analyzes website technology stacks. Traffic analytics platforms such as SimilarWeb and DataDotAI track login duration, time-on-site, and checkout page conversion rates. A 20% drop in login traffic in a quarter, even if the company claims growth, may prompt immediate share sales in the secondary market. Hank Park, a Forbes Tech advisor, noted, 'The era of relying on networks and intuition in private investing is ending, replaced by real-time data analytics and algorithmic transparency that bring non-public company information to public-market levels.'\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 12:34 AM\nSource:[\uc778\ud130\ub137\ub274\uc2a4 \ud55c\uacbd\ub2f7\ucef4](https://www.hankyung.com/article/202602030120i)\n\n**Here's the one thing the bond market is hoping to avoid on Wednesday**\nTraders in the U.S. bond market are closely monitoring the Treasury Department's refunding announcement scheduled for 8:30 a.m. Eastern time on Wednesday, February 4, 2026, as it may reveal changes to the size of upcoming note and bond auctions. The $30 trillion Treasury market has remained stable despite broader financial market turmoil and renewed concerns about the 'Sell America' trade. This stability is partly due to the Treasury\u2019s reliance on short-term T-bills, which accounted for over 80% of total issuance in 2025, according to the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association. Investors are particularly focused on whether the Treasury will increase the sizes of auctions for securities ranging from 2-year notes to 30-year bonds\u2014changes that could increase supply, drive down bond prices, and push yields higher. The Treasury\u2019s current guidance, last updated in November, included preliminary consideration of larger auctions. If the guidance remains unchanged, TD Securities\u2019 Gennadiy Goldberg predicts yields could decline; if altered, he warns this could create immediate upward pressure on interest rates. The Treasury has already disclosed a $574 billion net marketable debt borrowing expectation for January\u2013March 2026, exceeding estimates from TD Securities ($561B), Deutsche Bank, and Jefferies ($555B). On Monday, the 10-year Treasury yield rose 3.6 basis points to 4.28%, and the 30-year yield increased nearly the same amount to 4.9%, while major U.S. stock indexes closed higher. TD Securities\u2019 base case anticipates auction size increases beginning in late 2026, while Jefferies\u2019 Thomas Simons urged openness to potential surprises in the guidance. The announcement will follow the release of the ADP private-sector employment report by 15 minutes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 09:32 PM\nSource:[Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20260202141/heres-the-one-thing-the-bond-market-is-hoping-to-avoid-on-wednesday)\n\n**Vivek Kaul: Budget is not anti-market, itis anti-illusion**\nThe Indian stock market declined by nearly 2% on Sunday following the release of the Union Budget, with the BSE Sensex and mid- and small-cap stocks all falling. Market participants, including fund managers, brokers, and financial influencers, attributed the drop to the government's decision to increase the securities transaction tax (STT) on futures and options trading. However, the article argues that the real issue lies in collapsed market expectations rather than the STT hike. The author, Vivek Kaul, explains that money managers (OPM wallahs) had built up high expectations through pre-budget speculation, pushing for the abolition or reduction of long-term capital gains taxes to attract retail and foreign institutional investors (FIIs). Despite the Sensex falling 6% since its September 2024 peak and small stocks declining further, the government chose revenue realism over market appeasement. Tax revenue forecasts for 2025-26 show a shortfall: gross tax revenues expected to grow 7.4% instead of the budgeted 10.8%, and personal income tax growth projected at 6.2% versus 14.4%. Personal income tax, including long-term capital gains, now accounts for the largest share of tax revenues\u2014expected to be just over a third in 2026-27. The Economic Survey notes that equity and investment funds' share of household financial assets rose from 15.7% in March 2019 to 23% by March 2025, while deposits fell from 46.3% to 39.6%, indicating strong retail participation. Given this, further incentives are unnecessary. High valuations, fueled by retail inflows and IPOs of unprofitable companies, have led to wealth transfer from the middle class to the rich. The budget was not anti-market, but 'anti-illusion'\u2014rejecting unrealistic market hype. The market's reaction was not due to policy changes but to the collapse of inflated expectations. The article concludes that the government prioritized fiscal responsibility over catering to market noise, resulting in disappointment masked as outrage. The real story is not the STT increase, but the failure of market narratives to match economic reality.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 08:56 AM\nSource:[Mumbai Mirror](https://mumbaimirror.indiatimes.com/mumbai/cover-story/budget-is-notanti-market-itis-anti-illusion/articleshow/127846350.html)\n\n**WTI oil rally pauses on OPEC+ hold, bullish trend reversal still intact for 70 later**\nWTI oil prices dipped slightly following OPEC+'s decision to maintain current output levels for March, with no changes to the previously agreed plan to gradually increase production by approximately 2.9 million barrels per day from April to December 2025. The group, including Saudi Arabia and Russia, representing about 3% of global demand, chose to delay further production increases due to typically weaker seasonal demand early in the year. Notably, OPEC+ provided no guidance on production plans beyond March, maintaining strategic ambiguity\u2014particularly amid rising U.S.\u2013Iran tensions and recent crude prices reaching six-month highs due to fears of military escalation. The pullback in WTI is interpreted as a corrective pause rather than a reversal of the bullish trend. Technically, the dip confirms a short-term peak at $66.55 and suggests consolidation after a five-wave rally from the $54.98 low. Support is expected near the 38.2% retracement level of $62.13, where buying interest is likely to return. The broader technical outlook remains positive: the breakout above $64.10\u2014the 38.2% retracement of the 2024\u20132025 sell-off from $78.87 to $54.98\u2014suggests the bearish phase has ended. The rally from $54.98 is now seen as the third leg of a larger recovery pattern beginning at $55.20. As long as the 55-day EMA (currently at $60.14) holds, the medium-term bias remains bullish, targeting the 61.8% retracement level at $69.74 and potentially higher. Geopolitical risks, especially concerning Iran, are expected to continue supporting prices, with near-term dips likely to attract buyers rather than signal a trend reversal.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 08:06 AM\nSource:[ActionForex](https://www.actionforex.com/live-comments/627821-wti-oil-rally-pauses-on-opec-hold-bullish-trend-reversal-still-intact-for-70-later/)\n\n**Bitcoin Drops Pace At $97K As Retail Stays Sidelined: Did The Rally End?**\nBitcoin stabilized near $95,500 on January 15, 2026, following an 8% rally over three days that liquidated $465 million in short BTC futures positions. Despite the rebound, retail traders remained sidelined, as indicated by Google Trends data showing global search interest for 'crypto' at 27\u2014near a 12-month low of 22. The Bitcoin perpetual futures funding rate stood at 4%, below the neutral range of 8%\u201312%, signaling weak bullish sentiment. While institutional investors are actively buying spot Bitcoin ETFs, with assets surpassing $120 billion, and corporate buyers continue accumulating Bitcoin treasuries\u2014adding over $105 billion in holdings\u2014retail interest remains low. This lack of retail participation contrasts with Bitcoin\u2019s historical role as a competitor to precious metals, especially amid a 28% silver rally in two weeks. Concerns about socio-political risks, including the US Justice Department\u2019s criminal inquiry into Federal Reserve building overruns and speculation about Trump-era pressure on rate cuts, have fueled uncertainty. With Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s mandate ending in April 2026, traders anticipate potential stimulus in the second half of 2026. However, Bitcoin has yet to prove itself as a reliable hedge during economic turmoil, leading to caution among retail investors. Despite these headwinds, institutional demand and corporate Bitcoin accumulation may drive Bitcoin toward $100,000, according to analysts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 10:34 PM\nSource:[Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/bitcoin-rally-collapses-at-97k-as-funding-rate-stalls-retail-traders-sit-out)\n\n**The Workforce Market is Changing in 2026**\nInvestors who previously funded software aimed at increasing employee productivity are shifting their strategies by 2026, now focusing on autonomous AI agents that can fully replace human labor, marking a new economic model where technology transitions from being a tool to becoming direct 'labor.' This shift is driving the adoption of the 'Service-as-a-Software' concept. Companies are no longer purchasing CRM systems for sales teams (SaaS); instead, they are renting AI sales representatives capable of handling sales, replying to emails, and scheduling meetings. Investors anticipate that entry-level white-collar jobs\u2014such as data analysis, customer service, and basic software development\u2014will be rapidly automated in 2026. Combined with a strong drive to reduce operational expenses (OpEx), this trend is making 'growth through workforce reduction' the central theme of 2026. A critical concern highlighted is the impact on global outsourcing (BPO) sectors, where call centers and data processing operations previously shifted to countries like India and the Philippines are now expected to be replaced by cheaper, 24/7 AI models. While this promises soaring profit margins for investors, it raises alarm bells for millions of workers in non-specialized or repetitive roles. 2026 is being described as an 'unforgiving year of productivity,' where technology is prioritizing cost elimination over human empowerment.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 09, 2026 06:04 AM\nSource:[CNN T\u00fcrk](https://www.cnnturk.com/teknoloji/2026da-is-gucu-piyasasi-degisiyor-2382908)\n\n**East Money Futures Morning Brief: Geopolitical Shifts, PMI Recovery, and Commodity Market Trends on January 5, 2026**\nThe January 5, 2026, morning report from East Money Futures highlights key developments across global markets. The article discusses the geopolitical impact of a reported U.S. move to take control of Venezuela, which has triggered concerns over oil, dollar, and gold markets. In China, the National Bureau of Statistics reported that the manufacturing Purchasing Managers' Index (PMI) rose to 50.1% in December 2025, up 0.9 percentage points from the previous month, entering the expansion zone. Large enterprises saw a 1.5-point increase to 50.8%, while small enterprises declined to 48.6%. On financial innovation, China's six major state-owned banks announced that starting January 1, 2026, they will pay interest on digital RMB wallets at the\u6d3b\u671f deposit rate. The Chinese Foreign Ministry expressed serious concern over U.S. actions involving the forced removal of Venezuelan President Maduro and his wife, calling it a violation of international law and urging immediate release and an end to regime change efforts. In commodities, iron ore stocks rose to 159.7 million tons, with increased imports and higher daily throughput. Steel markets showed rising production but declining social inventories, with rebar demand down slightly. Silica iron prices rose to 5,760 yuan/ton, with higher demand. The Dalian Commodity Exchange announced the launch of\u7126\u7164 (coking coal) options on January 16, 2026, with initial contracts based on JM2604 to JM2612 futures. In agricultural commodities, palm oil output in Malaysia declined due to lower yields and extraction rates. Egg prices remained stable across major regions. Lithium carbonate prices rose to 117,373 yuan/ton, while polysilicon margins held steady. Copper spot trading volume dropped to 13,600 tons, down 38.83% from the previous day. In the energy sector, EIA data showed a 1.934 million barrel drop in U.S. crude inventories, below expectations. Eight OPEC+ nations agreed in principle to pause oil production growth in Q1 2026. Methanol and glass inventories rose, while PVC stocks increased significantly. Pure alkali inventories slightly rose. U.S. initial jobless claims fell to 199,000, the lowest level since the start of the year, though seasonal volatility is expected.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 04, 2026 11:57 PM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202601043607994882.html)\n\n**Google makes major Green Card change: report**\nGoogle will resume reviewing green card sponsorship applications through the Program Electronic Review Management (PERM) system in 2026, after pausing most filings in January 2023 during a major round of layoffs that affected 12,000 employees. The company's decision to restart PERM applications\u2014marking a three-year pause\u2014signals renewed confidence in hiring and immigration trends. According to an internal December 2025 memo reviewed by Business Insider, Google will 'ramp up' PERM filings in 2026, with eligibility restricted to employees with a 'MI rating or higher' and requiring remote employees to agree to transfer to an office to qualify. PERM is the first step in the green card process, requiring employers to demonstrate that no qualified U.S. workers are available for the role. During the pause, Google only filed for a small number of employees. Immigration attorney Ava Benach noted that Google's actions have had a significant industry-wide effect, stating that 'tech companies have been following Google's lead' and that Google's retreat gave others 'cover to step back' as well. Eligible employees are expected to be contacted by external immigration legal counsel in the first quarter (Q1) of 2026, though the company did not clarify whether self-nomination or pre-eligibility checks are possible.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 23, 2025 04:25 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/google-green-card-sponsorship-perm-change-11261326)\n\n**Market Outlook: CCL and PCB Sectors Offer Low-Entry Opportunities Amid AI Supply Chain Expansion**\nThe Federal Reserve announced a 0.25 percentage point interest rate cut in December and initiated short-term Treasury bill purchases to inject liquidity. The dot plot indicates 0.25 percentage point rate cuts available in 2026 and 2027, with expectations that President Trump will appoint a new Fed chair aligned with his views after Jerome Powell's term ends in May 2026. This suggests a potential shift toward a neutral interest rate level, with continued room for rate cuts through 2026, extending the monetary easing trend. Recent downward pressure on supply chain costs from Nvidia has largely been priced in. Google's launch of Gemini 3 received positive reception, prompting OpenAI to accelerate the release of GPT-5.2, indicating that the AI competition remains intense. Nvidia is expected to double its CoWoS wafer production next year, with GB200 volume ramp-up followed by the launch of GB300, and the Rubin platform planned for 2026, continuing to drive AI growth. In ASICs, strong demand is expected in the transition phase ending and with Google\u2019s new model performing well, with 2026 growth anticipated. Investment focus remains on AI-related supply chains, given strong business outlooks and continued monitoring of cash flow trends from CSPs. Strategic positioning should target components benefiting from increased capital expenditures by CSPs and higher ASIC adoption, including HVDC, CCL, PCB, and thermal management sectors. With positive industry outlooks and favorable funding conditions, investors are advised to consider buying opportunities during market pullbacks or through systematic investment plans to capture industry growth.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 11, 2025 03:36 PM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5607/9197721)\n\n**TAKE FIVE: The smoke and fog of December afternoons**\nMarkets are entering December with strong momentum, driven by key developments across global financial centers. Alphabet, the parent company of Google, has emerged as the top-performing 'Magnificent 7' megacap in 2025, with its stock up nearly 70% year-to-date and market value approaching $4 trillion, fueled by strong cloud performance and the launch of its AI model Gemini. This rise has sparked speculation about Meta potentially spending billions on Google's chips, affecting Nvidia's shares. Meanwhile, Japan's financial markets are under strain due to a massive stimulus plan by Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, causing the 10-year Japanese government bond (JGB) yield to hit a 17-year high and the 30-year yield to reach a record, despite the yen weakening to a near 10-month low. The Bank of Japan may raise rates soon, with Governor Kazuo Ueda speaking on Monday. In geopolitical markets, U.S. President Donald Trump's renewed push to end the war in Ukraine has triggered shuttle diplomacy, with a 28-point U.S. peace plan countered by Europe and later revised by Kyiv and Washington. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated the updated framework could form the basis for future talks, but warned of continued conflict if not accepted. U.S. envoy Steve Witkoff is set to meet in Moscow. Ukrainian bonds have rallied, while European defense stocks and oil prices have declined. OPEC+ is expected to maintain current oil output levels through the first quarter of 2026, with no immediate supply increases, amid concerns over oversupply and weaker seasonal demand. Oil prices have fallen from a January peak of over $82 to the low $60s. Despite earlier volatility from erratic U.S. policymaking, markets have stabilized, with investors accepting that U.S. long-term fiscal health is unlikely to improve soon, though interest rates are expected to fall in 2026. Corporate earnings remain strong, and while the S&P 500 is on track for a 0.4% monthly decline in December, historical data shows the index has only fallen in both November and December in nine of the last 50 years.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 07:56 AM\nSource:[StreetInsider.com](https://www.streetinsider.com/Reuters/TAKE+FIVE:+The+smoke+and+fog+of+December+afternoons/25673411.html)\n\n**New Validated Insights Report: OPM Market Continues Slowdown**\nAccording to the updated October 2025 report by Validated Insights, the online program manager (OPM) market in the U.S. continues to contract, marked by declining new partnership initiations, reduced revenue, and diminished interest from institutions in forming new OPM arrangements. In 2024, only 81 new OPM partnerships were launched, a 45.0% drop from the first half of 2024 to the first half of 2025, where just 18 new partnerships were established. Industry revenue projections have fallen dramatically: pre-COVID estimates of $8.25 billion are now expected to be replaced by $3.37 billion in 2025\u2014just 40.9% of the original forecast. Among American private colleges and universities, 59% either have not worked with an OPM or are not considering it, while 31% already have an OPM partner, meaning 90% of private schools are either already engaged or disengaged from OPMs. Brady Colby, Head of Market Research at Validated Insights, stated, 'Clearly, these are not the best of times for online program managers,' noting limited growth and shortfalls in revenue expectations. The report also highlights a shift in business models toward fee-for-service and a la carte arrangements, with reduced revenue sharing. Despite the overall decline, OPM Risepoint remains the leading provider with 12.9% of active partnerships as of Q1 2025, expanding through existing partnerships. Zschool, a newer entrant, has emerged as the second-largest provider by number of active partnerships. Colby emphasized that while the market trajectory is downward, the OPM space is not dying but evolving, driven by new providers, changing models, and shifting student and institutional needs. Validated Insights regularly publishes reports on higher education trends, including MBA, nursing, computer science, AI, trade schools, and enrollment data.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 10:57 PM\nSource:[TMCNet on the web](https://www.tmcnet.com/usubmit/2025/10/30/10281471.htm)\n\n**How Investing Has Changed in the Last 5 Years**\nIn a podcast recorded on October 17, 2025, Motley Fool contributors Travis Hoium, Lou Whiteman, and Dan Caplinger discuss major shifts in investing over the past five years. They highlight that heavily shorted stocks and meme-driven equities have outperformed the broader market by a 4-to-1 margin, driven largely by retail investor enthusiasm. The conversation explores how meme stocks like GameStop and AMC emerged from speculative momentum, with some companies using elevated valuations to raise capital\u2014though not all succeeded (e.g., AMC's stock is down 99% from its 2021 peak). The panel debates whether this trend represents a new investment paradigm, with Lou Whiteman emphasizing the importance of long-term vision, as seen in companies like Rocket Lab and Joby Aviation, where stock performance supports business development. Dan Caplinger stresses the need for management transparency and consistency when a company becomes a meme stock. The discussion shifts to AI-related stocks, with TSMC and ASML showing strong earnings\u2014TSMC\u2019s revenue rose 40% in one quarter, while ASML\u2019s growth is constrained by long production cycles. Geopolitical risks around Taiwan-based TSMC are noted, with Warren Buffett having exited his position. The banking sector is analyzed for hidden risks, particularly in consumer credit and variable interest entities (VIEs), with Dan Caplinger warning that lack of transparency in complex financing structures can signal systemic risk. The panel then engages in a 'would you rather' game: Dan Caplinger chooses Coinbase over Palantir due to clearer business model and exposure to crypto addiction, while Lou Whiteman and Travis Hoium both favor Google over OpenAI due to greater stability and less structural uncertainty. The podcast concludes with reflections on AI as a sustaining innovation rather than a disruptive one, and the growing influence of credit card fees as a sign of changing financial infrastructure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 12:00 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/27/how-investing-has-changed-in-the-last-5-years/?source=newstex&utm_source=newstex&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=aba524c5-39ef-431c-9c88-3b7bd1bca5fa)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
