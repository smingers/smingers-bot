## (a) Source Analysis

**AskNews Articles (February 2-4, 2026):**

1. **Stockpulse (Feb 4, 2026):** Reports RCL closed at $326.29 on Feb 4, down -2.32% with trading volume of $747.8M. This is **factual price data** from the actual Feb 4 close - the baseline for our question. High quality, direct market data.

2. **GuruFocus (Feb 3, 2026):** Reports increased bearish options activity with Put/Call ratio of 4.56 (significantly elevated). Most active contracts were April 2026 $300 puts and June 2026 $280 puts. **Factual options data** indicating institutional bearish positioning. Moderate quality - options flow can be hedging rather than directional bets.

3. **Defense World (Feb 3, 2026):** JPMorgan raised price target from $368 to $371 with "overweight" rating. Multiple analyst upgrades cited: Stifel to $420, Goldman to $370, Mizuho to $379. Stock opened at $334.21 on Feb 3. **Factual analyst actions from named institutions**. High quality.

4. **Markets Insider (Feb 3, 2026):** Jamie Rollo (Morgan Stanley) maintained Hold rating with $330 target while stock was at $334.05. TipRanks-DeepSeek downgraded to Hold on Jan 19 with $298 target. **Mixed signals from identifiable analysts**. Moderate quality.

5. **NASDAQ (Feb 2, 2026):** RCL shares rose 3.85% on Feb 2 to close at $337.16 (from $324.66 previous close). **Factual price movement**. High quality.

6. **GuruFocus (Feb 2, 2026):** Reports Feb 2 close at $337.16, up 3.85%. Fair value (GF Value) estimated at $216.09, suggesting 35.91% downside. **Valuation opinion with methodology disclosed**. Moderate quality - GF Value is proprietary model.

**Key Price Timeline (Factual):**
- Jan 29: $346 (earnings day, +19%)
- Feb 2: $337.16 (+3.85%)
- Feb 3: $334.21 (opening)
- **Feb 4: $326.29 (close, -2.32%)** ← BASELINE

This is critical: The Feb 4 close of $326.29 is now confirmed. The question asks if Feb 14 will be HIGHER than $326.29.

**Earlier Context Sources (Pre-Feb 4):**
The summaries from TIKR, Motley Fool, etc. are now historical context. Key facts remain valid:
- Q4 2025 EPS: $2.80 (met estimates)
- 2026 guidance: $17.70-$18.10 EPS (above consensus)
- Two-thirds of 2026 capacity booked at record prices
- "Best seven booking weeks in company history"

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Feb 4 baseline established at $326.29** - Multiple independent sources confirm. This is 3.5% below the Feb 2 close of $337.16, indicating continued post-earnings consolidation.

2. **Elevated bearish options positioning (Feb 3)** - Put/Call ratio of 4.56 is highly unusual. While this could be hedging, the concentration in $300 and $280 strikes suggests institutional concern about downside. This is predictive of near-term pressure.

3. **Multiple analyst upgrades with targets $340-$420** - JPMorgan ($371), Stifel ($420), Goldman ($370), Mizuho ($379) from named institutions. However, current price $326.29 is already 14-29% below these targets, suggesting upside potential.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Post-earnings consolidation pattern continuing** - Stock declined from $346 (Jan 29) → $337 (Feb 2) → $326 (Feb 4). This 5.7% decline over 6 days suggests momentum exhaustion, consistent with historical patterns where 75-90% of post-earnings moves occur in first week.

2. **Mixed analyst sentiment** - Morgan Stanley Hold at $330 vs. multiple Buy ratings. The $330 target is only 1.1% above Feb 4 close, suggesting limited near-term upside expected by some analysts.

3. **GF Value at $216** - Suggests significant overvaluation, but this is a single proprietary model. Conflicts with fundamental analyst targets.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Strong fundamental story** - Record bookings and guidance remain intact, but this was already priced in during the Jan 29 spike. Diminishing marginal impact on price.

2. **WAVE season** - Positive backdrop but no specific catalyst scheduled between Feb 4-14.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 10 calendar days (Feb 4 close to Feb 14 close)

**Current Position in Cycle:**
- Day 6 post-earnings (Jan 29 → Feb 4)
- Already experienced 5.7% decline from post-earnings peak
- Entered period of typical consolidation/momentum decay

**Temporal Factors:**
1. **No scheduled catalysts** between Feb 4-14 except:
   - Feb 7: US jobs report (macro risk)
   - Feb 13: CPI report (macro risk, day before resolution)

2. **Historical pattern implications:** If 75-90% of post-earnings moves occur in first 7 days, Feb 4-14 captures the low-momentum tail. This suggests smaller magnitude moves and mean-reversion tendency.

3. **Options expiration cycles:** February monthly options expire Feb 21, which could create technical pressure in either direction as Feb 14 approaches.

**If Timeframe Halved (5 days):** Would increase probability of staying below $326.29 due to continued near-term consolidation momentum. Estimate 40-45% chance of being higher.

**If Timeframe Doubled (20 days):** Would increase probability of recovery as fundamentals reassert and new catalysts emerge (Q1 earnings preview, booking updates). Estimate 60-65% chance of being higher.

## (d) Justification

**Critical Shift from Outside View:**

My outside view was 57% based on data through Feb 3 showing $338.33. The **actual Feb 4 close of $326.29 represents a -3.6% decline**, which is highly material new information.

**Factors Warranting Downward Revision:**

1. **Accelerating downward momentum:** The decline accelerated from -0.4% (Feb 2→3) to -2.32% (Feb 4). This suggests selling pressure is intensifying, not abating.

2. **Bearish options positioning proving prescient:** The elevated Put/Call ratio on Feb 3 preceded the Feb 4 decline, suggesting informed positioning. This increases weight on continued near-term pressure.

3. **Technical breakdown:** $326.29 is now 10.9% below the Jan 29 peak of $366 and approaching the 50-day moving average around $323. Breaking below this support could trigger further technical selling.

4. **Distance from analyst targets narrowed paradoxically:** While price fell, the gap to targets widened (now 13.4% to JPMorgan's $371), but the question is about 10-day movement, not ultimate value. Near-term momentum matters more.

**Factors Supporting Upside:**

1. **Analyst support remains intact:** Fresh upgrades from JPMorgan (Feb 3) and others suggest institutional conviction. These upgrades typically drive buying over subsequent weeks.

2. **Oversold bounce potential:** A 5.7% decline in 6 days for a fundamentally strong stock with record guidance creates technical oversold conditions. RSI likely dropped from 62 to mid-50s, leaving room for bounce.

3. **Share buyback support:** $1.8B remaining authorization provides price floor, particularly if stock approaches $320 levels.

4. **No fundamental deterioration:** The decline is purely technical/profit-taking, not driven by news. Fundamentals (record bookings, raised guidance) remain intact.

**Critical Assessment:**

The question now asks: Will RCL recover from $326.29 to above this level within 10 days?

This reframes from "will momentum continue?" to "will consolidation reverse?" The latter is inherently more uncertain and typically has lower probability than trend continuation.

**Probability Calibration:**

Starting from 57% outside view, adjustments:
- **-8 points:** Accelerating downward momentum and bearish options positioning proving correct
- **-5 points:** Technical breakdown below recent support
- **-3 points:** Timeframe captures low-momentum post-earnings tail
- **+5 points:** Analyst upgrades typically drive buying over 1-2 weeks
- **+3 points:** Oversold bounce potential from strong fundamental base
- **+2 points:** Buyback support provides floor

**Net adjustment: -6 percentage points → 51%**

However, this still feels slightly overconfident given:
1. Clear downward momentum established
2. No scheduled positive catalysts
3. Macro risks (CPI on Feb 13) could extend decline

**Final calibration: 48%**

This reflects genuine uncertainty with slight tilt toward continued consolidation, acknowledging that recovery is plausible but faces headwinds from established momentum and lack of near-term catalysts.

## Probability Calibration

The Feb 4 close of $326.29 is the critical new information. The stock has declined 5.7% from its post-earnings peak and 2.32% on Feb 4 alone, establishing clear downward momentum. 

For RCL to close above $326.29 on Feb 14 requires either:
1. Reversal of current momentum (requires catalyst or oversold bounce)
2. Stabilization followed by gradual recovery (requires 10 days, which is short timeframe)

The probability slightly favors continued consolidation because:
- Momentum is accelerating downward (larger decline on Feb 4 than prior days)
- Bearish options positioning proved prescient
- Historical post-earnings pattern suggests diminishing upward momentum in days 6-16
- No scheduled positive catalysts; macro risks (CPI Feb 13) present

However, probability is close to 50-50 because:
- Multiple fresh analyst upgrades (JPMorgan, Stifel, Goldman) typically drive buying
- Fundamentals remain strong with no deterioration
- Technical oversold conditions create bounce potential
- Share buyback provides support

The balance of evidence suggests slight tilt toward continued consolidation, but uncertainty is high enough that this is essentially a coin flip with modest lean toward "No."

**Probability: 48%**

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will RCL stock close above $326.29 (Feb 4 close) on Feb 14, 2026? (10-day window)

2. **Base rate consistency:** Outside view was 57% for upward movement from $338 level. New information (actual Feb 4 close of $326.29, -3.6% decline) shifts this downward to 48%, reflecting established downward momentum.

3. **Consistency check:** "48 out of 100 times, RCL closes above $326.29 on Feb 14." This reflects genuine uncertainty with slight tilt toward continued consolidation - aligned with momentum analysis and lack of catalysts.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Feb 4 close $326.29, down 5.7% from Jan 29 peak - establishes downward momentum (factual, high quality)
   - Bearish Put/Call ratio 4.56 on Feb 3 preceded Feb 4 decline - suggests informed positioning (factual, moderate quality)
   - Multiple analyst upgrades Feb 3 (JPMorgan $371, Stifel $420) - typically drives buying (factual, high quality)
   - No catalysts Feb 4-14 except macro risks - limits recovery drivers (factual)
   - Historical post-earnings pattern: 75-90% moves in first week - suggests low momentum ahead (moderate quality)

5. **Blind spot:** Unexpected positive booking announcement or sector upgrade could trigger sharp reversal. If cruise sector receives unexpected positive catalyst (competitor earnings, industry data), could shift to 60-65% probability of upward movement.

6. **Status quo:** Current status quo is downward momentum (5.7% decline over 6 days). Given 10-day timeframe and typical post-earnings consolidation, modest continuation of this trend (another 1-3% decline) is plausible, supporting sub-50% probability.

Probability: 48%
