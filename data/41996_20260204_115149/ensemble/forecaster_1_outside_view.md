Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**MarketBeat Articles (Multiple):**
These articles provide comprehensive factual data on RCL's financial performance, analyst ratings, and guidance. Key facts include:
- Q4 2025 EPS: $2.80 (met consensus), Revenue: $4.26B (slightly missed $4.28B consensus)
- FY 2026 guidance: EPS $17.70-$18.10 vs. consensus $17.69
- Q1 2026 guidance: EPS $3.18-$3.28 vs. consensus $2.94
- Stock price on 2026-02-03: $338.33 (up 4.2% that day)
- 52-week high: $366.50 (reached on earnings day, Jan 29)

The analyst opinions are well-sourced with named institutions (JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, Mizuho, etc.). Consensus rating is "Moderate Buy" with average target of $333-$340. These are high-quality sources with verifiable data points.

**Yahoo Finance/AOL Articles:**
These corroborate the earnings data and add crucial forward-looking information:
- Two-thirds of 2026 capacity already booked at record rates
- "Highest seven booking weeks in company history" during Cyber Sales/WAVE season
- Strong operational metrics: 108-110% load factors, 9.2% gross margin yield increase

These are factual statements from management, representing company guidance rather than independent analysis.

**StockMarketGuides Article:**
This is primarily educational content about earnings volatility with limited forecasting value. It confirms RCL operated 67 ships as of Feb 2025 but provides no specific predictions for the Feb 4-14 window.

**Agent Report:**
This synthesizes available information and provides structured analysis of catalysts. Key insights include:
- Stock jumped 19% on earnings day (Jan 29) to $366, then pulled back to $338 by Feb 3
- Historical pattern suggests 75-90% of quarterly performance occurs in first week post-earnings
- Technical indicators show RSI of 62 (overbought territory)
- 10-day window analysis framework is sound but acknowledges data gaps

The agent report quality is good for synthesis but lacks primary data on historical 10-day patterns.

**Price History from Agent Report:**
- Jan 27: $291
- Jan 28: $292
- Jan 29: $346 (earnings day, +19%)
- Jan 30: $351
- Jan 31: $349
- Feb 3: $338

This shows a 7.7% decline from the post-earnings peak of $366 to $338 by Feb 3.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **RCL's historical 10-day post-earnings price movements:**
   - Most relevant but data is limited in sources
   - Agent report suggests 75-90% of quarterly moves occur in first week
   - Implies remaining 3-7 days (Feb 4-14 covers 10 days) may show lower momentum

2. **Cruise industry stocks post-earnings:**
   - Broader but less specific
   - Industry showing strong demand signals across competitors (MSC, Norwegian)
   - Relevant for sector-wide momentum

3. **High-beta leisure stocks after strong earnings beats:**
   - RCL has beta of 1.94, suggesting amplified market moves
   - After initial spike, such stocks often consolidate
   - Somewhat relevant given technical overbought conditions

4. **General stock price movements over 10-day periods:**
   - Too broad, lacks specificity
   - Historical data shows ~54% chance of any stock rising over 10 days
   - Least suitable given we have company-specific information

**Selected Reference Class:** RCL's post-earnings behavior and high-beta leisure stocks after earnings beats, with consideration of the 10-day timeframe.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 10 calendar days (Feb 4 to Feb 14, 2026)

**Key Temporal Factors:**

1. **Position in earnings cycle:** Feb 4 is 6 days post-earnings (Jan 29). The initial reaction (+19% to $366) has partially reversed (-7.7% to $338 by Feb 3).

2. **Historical post-earnings pattern:** If 75-90% of moves occur in first 5-7 days, the Feb 4-14 window captures the tail-end consolidation phase where volatility typically declines.

3. **Catalyst density:** No scheduled company events. Macro catalysts include:
   - Feb 7: US jobs report
   - Feb 13: CPI report
   
4. **WAVE season timing:** Mid-February falls within peak booking season (Jan-March), making any booking updates material.

5. **Technical setup:** Stock is 16% above 50-day MA ($282.50), suggesting overbought conditions that often lead to consolidation.

## (d) Justification for Outside View

**Bullish Factors:**
- Strong fundamental backdrop: Record bookings, raised guidance significantly above consensus
- Analyst momentum: JPMorgan raised target to $371 (9.7% above Feb 3 close)
- 18 of 23 analysts have Buy ratings
- Share buyback program ($1.8B remaining) provides support
- Fuel prices stable-to-declining (modest tailwind)
- Two-thirds of 2026 already booked reduces execution risk

**Bearish/Neutral Factors:**
- Already captured 19% gain on earnings day; most post-earnings alpha realized
- Technical overbought: RSI 62, 16% above 50-day MA
- Natural consolidation after sharp moves is common
- Feb 3 showed -3.7% pullback, suggesting profit-taking
- Historical pattern suggests diminishing momentum in days 6-10 post-earnings
- Macro uncertainty (CPI on Feb 13 could trigger volatility)
- Current price $338 is only 1.4% below consensus target of $340-343

**Statistical Baseline:**
- For a 10-day period, random walk would suggest ~50% probability of positive return
- High beta (1.94) amplifies both directions
- Post-earnings volatility decay typically reduces magnitude of moves

**Critical Assessment:**
The stock needs to close above $338.33 on Feb 14. Given it closed at $338.33 on Feb 3 (the last known price), this essentially asks: will RCL be higher in 10 days from a point that's already captured most post-earnings gains?

The combination of:
1. Strong fundamentals (supports floor)
2. Technical overbought conditions (suggests consolidation)
3. Diminishing post-earnings momentum (historical pattern)
4. Lack of near-term catalysts except macro data
5. Already near analyst consensus targets

Suggests a slight edge toward upward movement but with meaningful probability of consolidation or modest decline.

## Outside View Calibration

**Tethering to Available Data:**
- Current price: $338.33
- Analyst average target: $340.10 (+0.5%)
- JPMorgan target: $371 (+9.7%)
- 52-week high: $366.50 (+8.3%)

The question asks for price on Feb 14 vs. Feb 4. We know Feb 3 closed at $338.33. Assuming Feb 4 opens near this level, we need the stock to be higher 10 days later.

**Probability Considerations:**
- Base rate for 10-day positive return: ~50-52% (slight upward drift in equities)
- Adjustment for post-earnings consolidation pattern: -5 to -10 percentage points
- Adjustment for strong fundamentals and analyst support: +5 to +8 percentage points
- Adjustment for technical overbought: -3 to -5 percentage points
- Adjustment for high beta amplifying market moves: ±2 percentage points depending on market direction

**Net Assessment:**
The factors roughly balance, with a slight tilt toward positive given:
- Strong fundamental story remains intact
- Buyback support
- Analyst upgrades may continue trickling in
- WAVE season updates could provide positive surprises

However, the magnitude of expected move is small given proximity to targets and natural consolidation after 19% spike.

**Calibration:** Given the balanced factors with slight positive tilt, and acknowledging that small moves either direction are possible, the probability should be modestly above 50% but well below 70% (which would imply strong conviction of upward movement).

Outside View Prediction:
**57%**
