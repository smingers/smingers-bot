Analysis:
### (a) Source analysis
1) **MarketBeat (2026-01-30) – FY2026/Q1 guidance**
- **Factual content:** EPS guidance ranges (FY2026 $17.70–$18.10; Q1 $3.18–$3.28), recent trading stats (moving averages, 52-week range), capital return items (dividend, buyback authorization), liquidity ratios, and a list of analyst ratings/targets.
- **Opinion content:** “Moderate buy” consensus and individual analyst ratings/targets are opinions, but attributable to identifiable institutions (higher-quality as opinions go).
- **Quality notes:** MarketBeat is a secondary aggregator; numbers are likely directionally right but I treat them as *reasonable, not definitive*. Still useful for context (post-earnings environment, sentiment).

2) **Yahoo Finance (2026-02-01) – “Two-thirds of 2026 booked…”**
- **Factual content:** Recap of reported Q4/FY results and management statements about bookings, pricing, and guidance; also buyback usage and liquidity figures.
- **Opinion content:** Minimal; mostly reported statements and framing.
- **Quality notes:** Generally solid as a newswire-style recap; still ultimately reliant on company disclosures.

3) **AOL/Benzinga (2026-02-01) – similar recap**
- **Factual content:** Largely duplicates Yahoo’s numbers/guidance.
- **Opinion content:** Light framing; mostly restatement.
- **Quality notes:** Redundant but corroborative.

4) **MarketBeat (2026-02-02) – analyst target changes + close**
- **Factual content:** Reports a specific close ($338.33) and cites several bank targets/ratings.
- **Opinion content:** Targets/ratings are opinions (attributable).
- **Quality notes:** Useful for capturing *post-earnings* analyst reaction and a recent close, but still an aggregator.

5) **StockMarketGuides (earnings page)**
- **Factual content:** Generic statements (earnings can cause volatility), “next earnings not scheduled.”
- **Opinion content:** None material; it’s educational.
- **Quality notes:** Low incremental value for a 10-day directional question; doesn’t provide a measurable edge.

6) **Agent report (multi-factor summary)**
- **Factual content (claimed):** Some closing-price history and macro-calendar items; qualitative notes about post-earnings dynamics; fuel price snapshots.
- **Opinion/interpretation:** Many causal claims (e.g., what “historically” happens post-earnings, how much crude affects EPS) are plausible but not well-cited in the provided excerpt.
- **Quality notes:** Helpful for brainstorming drivers, but I discount unsupported “internal estimates” and any price history not directly verifiable from a primary tape/source.

**Bottom line from sources for outside-view purposes:** We are in a short, post-earnings window with elevated attention; however, none of the sources provides a rigorous base-rate statistic for “probability up over the next ~7–8 trading days,” so we should lean on reference classes.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view)
Plausible reference classes for: “Will a single US stock be higher in ~10 calendar days?”

1) **All US large-cap stocks, 2-week horizon (7–10 trading days):**  
   - **Pros:** Strongest base-rate anchor; lots of historical data; matches the question structure (binary up/down over short horizon).  
   - **Cons:** Doesn’t reflect RCL’s higher beta / higher volatility (though volatility affects magnitude more than direction).

2) **High-beta consumer discretionary/leisure stocks, 2-week horizon:**  
   - **Pros:** Closer to RCL’s risk profile.  
   - **Cons:** Still broad; and without a dataset here, it risks becoming hand-wavy.

3) **Stocks in the 1–2 weeks immediately after earnings:**  
   - **Pros:** Contextually relevant (RCL just reported).  
   - **Cons:** Competing effects (post-earnings drift vs. profit-taking) often net out; without quantified base rates, hard to anchor.

**Most suitable for a clean outside view:** (1) broad large-cap 2-week direction, then *lightly* adjust for context only if warranted.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **From:** 2026-02-04 close  
- **To:** 2026-02-14 (but markets are typically closed on Feb 14; resolution likely uses the most recent close, i.e., **Feb 13, 2026**)  
- **Horizon:** ~**9–10 calendar days**, about **7–8 trading days**.

**Historical pattern over similar periods (outside view):**
- For broad equities, very short-horizon returns are close to a random walk with a small positive drift (equity risk premium).  
- Over ~1–2 weeks, the **probability of being up is typically only modestly above 50%** (often in the low-to-mid 50s), because the drift is small relative to daily noise.

---

### (d) Justification (outside view synthesis)
- **Status quo / default expectation:** In the absence of strong new information, a stock’s next-2-week direction is near coin-flip, with a slight upward bias consistent with the general positive drift in equities.
- **Volatility considerations:** RCL’s beta (~1.9 per sources) implies *larger swings*, but **not necessarily** a materially higher probability of finishing up vs. down over just ~7–8 sessions.
- **Post-earnings context:** While some stocks exhibit post-earnings drift, this is not reliably one-directional in the very short run; “good news already priced” and profit-taking can offset.
- **Therefore:** The cleanest outside view is a **small** tilt toward “Yes,” not an aggressive one.

---

Outside view calibration:
- A reasonable tether is the generic 2-week “up” base rate for large-cap equities: **~52–55%**.
- Given RCL’s high volatility and the recent sharp move around earnings (which can increase two-sided uncertainty rather than directional certainty), I *avoid* pushing the probability much higher.
- I settle near the middle of that band.

Outside View Prediction:
**Yes = 53%**
