Analysis:

1. Source analysis (quality, fact vs. opinion)
   • TIKR (30 Jan 26) – Post-earnings news. Facts: price $346 on 29 Jan, EPS guidance, bookings. Opinions: “premium valuation” (author). Medium reliability (secondary site quoting the 8-K & call).  
   • Benzinga/FinancialModelingPrep (30 Jan 26) – Same earnings numbers; neutral wording. Medium reliability.  
   • Motley Fool (29 Jan 26) – Adds cash-flow metrics, long-term view. Facts quoted from 10-K/call; opinions are author’s. Medium reliability.  
   • DefenceWorld / JPMorgan note (3 Feb 26) – Lists analyst upgrades and $371 PT. Facts: PTs, dividend/buy-back. Opinions: PTs. High reliability for “who said what,” low for directional value.  
   • GuruFocus options piece (3 Feb 26) – Reports unusual put positioning, gives valuation multiples. Facts: put/call ratio, IV, multiples. Opinions: “over-valued.” Medium reliability.  
   • Stockpulse price flash (04 Feb 26 07:22 CET) – Intraday trade $326.29 (-2.3%). Pure ticker data. High reliability.  
   • Other listed items (option volume 2 Feb, analyst hold 3 Feb, etc.) largely repeat the same factual tapestry. No contradictory data.

2. Evidence analysis (scored)
   Strong:
   • None – no structural, multi-source causal driver guaranteeing direction within 8 trading days.

   Moderate:
   • Positive post-earnings fundamental news confirmed by several independent outlets; analyst target-hike cluster (↑ probability +2).  
   • Two-thirds of 2026 capacity already booked, supporting narrative demand momentum (↑ +1).  
   • Buy-back authority ($2 B ≈ 2.6 % float) provides downside cushion (↑ +1).  
   • Short horizon usually drifts with market; S&P 500 seasonality early Feb slightly positive (↑ +1).  
   • Heightened put activity & valuation stretch (GuruFocus) indicate some bearish sentiment (↓ –2).  
   • Very recent 16 % run-up since mid-Jan → mean-reversion risk (↓ –2).  

   Weak:
   • One-day pre-market dip 4 Feb; may reverse intraday.  
   • Options chatter about arbitrage (Barchart Nov 25) stale.

   Net moderate evidence bias: small positive tilt roughly cancels small negative tilt → near-base-rate.

3. Timeframe analysis
   • Horizon: 8 trading days (4 Feb close → 13 Feb close; market closed Sun 14).  
   • If horizon were halved (4 trading days) probability would fall toward 51 % (less drift, more noise).  
   • If doubled (16 trading days) probability would rise toward 56 – 57 % (more time for risk-premium & buy-back to work).

4. Justification & base-rate anchoring
   • Historical reference: large-cap U.S. stocks finish higher over the next 2-week window about 53-55 % of the time.  
   • RCL beta ≈ 1.9 ⇒ bigger swings, but direction probability remains similar.  
   • Post-earnings drift for positive surprises is weakly positive (~55 % over 10 trading days, cf. Frazzini et al.). RCL’s “meet-plus-strong-guide” qualifies.  
   • Valuation/overbought & fresh put demand are counterweights.  
   • I adjust the 53 % outside view upward 1 pt for the analyst-upgrade cluster and buy-back, then downward 1 pt for stretched near-term rally & bearish options. Net = no change, but add 1 pt for equity-risk-premium over a week.

Probability calibration

Point estimate Yes = 54 %.  
90 % CI for a well-calibrated forecaster on a binary like this would be roughly ±15 pp (i.e., 39-69 %), reflecting high noise in 8-day stock moves.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will RCL close higher on 14 Feb 26 than on 4 Feb 26 (U.S. market close)?” ✔  
2. Outside base: 53–55 % generic 2-week up-probability. ✔  
3. Consistency: “In 54 of 100 similar 8-day windows RCL would end higher.” ✔  
4. Top evidence: a) recent upbeat guidance; b) analyst PT cluster; c) new $2 B buy-back; d) heavy put activity; e) +16 % rally since mid-Jan. ✔  
5. Blind spot: broad market sell-off (e.g., new macro shock) within next week would drop odds sharply.  
6. Status quo bias: drift is small, so staying near 50 % is prudent. ✔

Probability: 54%
