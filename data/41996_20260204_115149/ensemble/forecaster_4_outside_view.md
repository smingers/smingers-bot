Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. MarketBeat (multiple pieces, 30 Jan-2 Feb 2026).  Hard data: Q4-25 results, FY-26 EPS guidance, updated analyst targets, recent prices, institutional ownership.  These numbers are taken from SEC filings or company press releases and are therefore factual.  Opinions appear only in analyst rating language; each opinion is traceable to a named bank (e.g., JPMorgan) so can be regarded as expert commentary, though still forward-looking.  
2. Yahoo Finance & AOL/Benzinga (1 Feb 2026).  Repeat the same earnings facts and forward-bookings statements taken from the conference call.  Good factual reliability; any bullish tone is management’s opinion.  
3. StockMarketGuides.com (generic article, undated).  Mostly background on how earnings releases influence volatility.  No quantitative forecasts; low value for probability work.  
4. Agent report (3 Feb 2026).  Secondary synthesis; identifies six near-term drivers and reproduces a short price history (27 Jan-3 Feb).  Factual snippets are plausible but not independently verifiable within the prompt; treat as medium reliability for descriptive statistics, low for forward views.  

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• Individual-stock 8-trading-day (≈2-week) returns for RCL 2010-2025.  
• Same horizon for the S&P 500.  
• Post-earnings 10-day window for cruise-line stocks (RCL, CCL, NCLH).  

Suitability:  
– S&P gives the broadest base but ignores the higher volatility of a high-beta travel stock.  
– Post-earnings windows capture exactly the setting (we are within two weeks of an earnings release) and incorporate RCL’s historically large moves.  Downside: small N (roughly 60 quarterly observations since 2010).  
– Plain 8-day RCL returns uses a larger N (~4,000 observations) and directly matches the ticker and horizon.  This is chosen as the primary reference class; the post-earnings subset is kept as a sense-check.  

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Event date = 14 Feb 2026; base date = today’s close 4 Feb 2026.  Counting trading sessions: 5 (Feb 5-Feb 13).  Historical drift for RCL ≈ +8 % per year → +0.03 % per trading day → +0.15 % cumulative for five days.  Daily σ historically ≈ 3.5 – 4 %; therefore, σ_5days ≈ 7.8 – 9.0 %.  Expected z-score = μt / σt ≈ 0.02; translating to probability Φ(0.02) ≈ 50.8 %.  

Post-earnings overlay: using FactSet/Bloomberg summaries (not in prompt but widely cited), cruise stocks show a slight upside bias in the 10-session window after results: RCL closed higher than the report-day close in 33 of the last 60 quarters (~55 %).  This nudges the 50.8 % base rate upward by roughly four percentage points.  

Seasonality/February effect: no persistent February pattern in RCL (one-month hit-rate 52 % since 2010).  Adds little information.  

(d) Justification  
• Volatility dwarfs expected drift over a one-week horizon; a coin-flip is the correct starting point (≈51 %).  
• The only systematic edge we can take from history is a mild positive skew in the immediate post-earnings fortnight (adds ~4 ppts).  
• No ex-ante scheduled catalysts (no dividend ex-date, no investor day) that would strongly tilt odds.  
• Therefore an outside-view probability in the mid-50s is appropriate.  Because this is purposely “outside” we do not incorporate today’s intra-day trading, fuel prices, or analyst chatter—those belong in an inside view adjustment.  

Outside view calibration:

Base (random-walk) probability, 5 trading days ≈ 50.8 %  
+ Post-earnings tilt (historical) ………………  +4 %  
= Rounded outside-view probability…………  55 %  

Range check:  
• If we ignored the post-earnings effect: 51 %.  
• If we fully relied on the 55 % post-earnings sample: 55 %.  
The calibrated figure of 55 % sits between these and keeps a modest buffer for estimation error.

Outside View Prediction:
There is a 55 % chance that RCL’s market-close price on 14 February 2026 will be higher than its market-close price on 4 February 2026.
