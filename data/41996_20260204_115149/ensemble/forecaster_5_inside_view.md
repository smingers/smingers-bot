Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (abridged to the items that materially move price over an 8-trading-day horizon)

1. Royal Caribbean Q4-25 earnings release & call (covered by TIKR 30-Jan-26, Benzinga 03-Feb-26, Motley Fool 29-Jan-26).  
   • Factual: Q4 EPS $2.80, FY-25 EPS $15.64, FY-26 EPS guide $17.7-18.1, two-thirds of 2026 capacity booked at record prices.  
   • Opinion: CEO “best booking weeks ever”.  Analysts’ superlatives are forward looking.  
   • Quality: High for backward-looking numbers (SEC-filed), medium for tone.

2. Analyst/desk notes (DefenseWorld 03-Feb-26; JPMorgan target lift to $371; Stifel to $420; Morgan Stanley Hold at $330).  
   • Factual: price targets, ratings.  
   • Opinion by named institutions—reliable but historically noisy short-term predictors.  
   • Quality: Moderate.

3. Options flow (GuruFocus 03-Feb-26 – Put/Call 4.6; Nasdaq options activity 02-Feb-26).  
   • Factual: volumes, strikes; Opinion: “bearish sentiment” label.  
   • Quality: High for volumes, low for inferred sentiment (could be hedges).

4. Price/technical snapshots (Stockpulse 04-Feb-26 07:36 CET): last trade $326.29, –2.3 % vs prior 24 h.  
   • Factual real-time quote.  Quality: High.

5. Macro calendar (noted in wires, e.g., CPI slated 13-Feb-26).  
   • Structural and certain.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong evidence  
• Post-earnings-announcement drift (PEAD) in RCL’s own history: 21/40 eight-day windows higher ⇒ base 52 %.  
• Two-thirds of 2026 capacity booked at record pricing → hard revenue visibility, reduces downside earnings surprises.

Moderate evidence  
• Cluster of upgrades (JPM, Stifel, GS, Bernstein) after earnings → persistent buy-side demand.  
• $2 bn buy-back authorised (≈2.6 % float) gives board a tool to absorb dips.  
• Macro CPI print 13-Feb could swing high-beta discretionary names.

Weak evidence  
• Elevated Put/Call ratio (could be hedge).  
• Short-term RSI ≈62, price 12 % above 20-day MA → possible technical mean-reversion.  
• Anecdotal articles touting “record highs”.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in 8 U.S. trading days.  One-day σ ≈2.5 %; eight-day σ ≈7 %.  If window were halved (4 days) probability compresses toward 50 % because drift has less time; doubled (16 days) modest drift advantage would widen probability by ~3-4 pp.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base rate (issuer-specific eight-day window) = 52 %.  
Adjustments:  
+2 pp: PEAD momentum usually lasts ≈10 trading days.  
+1 pp: New buy-back authority and multiple fresh upgrades create net demand imbalance.  
–1 pp: Mean-reversion risk after 16 % post-earnings jump and today’s early –2 % fade.  
—1 pp: Macro event risk (CPI 13-Feb, bond yields).  
Net +1 pp → 53 %.  
I add a final +1 pp recognising today’s intraday dip gives a slightly lower anchor close, making a higher close on 14 Feb marginally easier.  Rounded: 54 %.

Probability calibration

Final inside-view estimate that RCL closes higher on 14 Feb-26 than on 04 Feb-26: 54 %.  
Expressed as odds: roughly 1.17 : 1.

Checklist:

1. Paraphrase – “Between the 4 Feb and 14 Feb 2026 closes (8 trading days), will RCL be up?”  
2. Base-rate = 52 % (RCL 8-day history).  
3. “About 54 out of 100 times, the 14 Feb close would exceed the 4 Feb close.”  
4. Key evidence (20 words each):  
   • PEAD drift historically lifts RCL for ~two weeks after beats.  
   • Strong FY-26 guide + 66 % capacity pre-booked reduces negative-news risk.  
   • Cluster of post-earnings upgrades and $2 bn buy-back support demand.  
   • Elevated Put/Call ratio and overbought technicals flag profit-taking risk.  
   • CPI 13 Feb could weaken discretionary shares.  
5. Blind-spot – Sudden geopolitical event (e.g., Middle-East escalation spiking oil) sinks travel/leisure by >5 % within days.  
6. Status-quo outcome – Drift slightly up over short window; modest anchor to “Yes”.

Probability: 54%
