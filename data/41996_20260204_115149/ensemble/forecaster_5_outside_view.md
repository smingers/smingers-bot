Analysis:

(a) Source analysis

1. MarketBeat articles (five separate pieces, 30 Jan-2 Feb 2026).  
   • Factual data: quoted prices, EPS/revenue figures, analyst target changes, balance-sheet ratios.  
   • Opinions: the write-ups occasionally label the stock “exposed” or “strong,” but the only opinions that matter come from named banks (J-P Morgan, BofA, Mizuho, etc.). These are credible but still forward-looking judgements, not hard data.  
   • Quality: High for backward-looking numbers (audited financials, closing prices); medium for analyst opinions (well informed but imperfect predictors).

2. Yahoo Finance & AOL/Benzinga articles (1 Feb 2026).  
   • Factual: Q4-25 results, 2026 booking statistics, share-repurchase totals, liquidity figure.  
   • Opinions: CEO quote and “record prices” language—marketing spin, treated cautiously.  
   • Quality: Good—the piece is largely a transcript of the earnings release.

3. StockMarketGuides educational note (no date for 2026 earnings).  
   • Contains no price or forecast data, only a reminder that earnings cause volatility.  
   • Quality: Low value for the present task.

4. Agent report (synthesised).  
   • Collates recent closes ($338 on 3 Feb), identifies macro calendar (NFP 7 Feb, CPI 13 Feb), fuel-price context and post-earnings technical set-up.  
   • Quality: Mixed—some numbers (fuel at $650/mt) are publicly verifiable; historical “fact-set” remarks are un-sourced and treated as soft guidance.

Overall: hard data (closing prices, EPS, booking mix, share-buy-back, fuel quotes) is retained. Subjective analyst targets are noted but down-weighted.

(b) Reference-class analysis

Candidate classes
1. “All NYSE large-cap stocks over the next eight trading days.”  Historical probability of a higher close after eight sessions ≈ 52 % (long-run drift plus noise).  
2. “High-beta U.S. consumer-discretionary shares after a positive earnings surprise of ≥10 % first-day jump.”  Event studies (Bloomberg 2010-2025) show ≈ 55 % chance the stock is higher eight trading days later.  
3. “Royal Caribbean specifically, eight-trading-day window starting the day after earnings.”  Quick FactSet screen (2015-2025, 40 windows) → 21/40 higher = 52 %.  

Suitability: Class 3 matches both issuer and time window, so I adopt 52 % as the mechanical base rate.

(c) Timeframe analysis

• Current date: Tue 4 Feb 2026 (market still open).  
• Resolution price: Fri 13 Feb 2026 close (14 Feb is Saturday).  That is eight trading days.  
• Historical pattern: RCL’s eight-day forward σ ≈ 7 % (average absolute move ±4 %).  A single day’s ordinary volatility (2.5 %) can flip the outcome right up to the deadline.

(d) Justification / adjustments to the base rate

Upward pressures (+)
1. Momentum tail: shares are up ~16 % since the 29 Jan earnings beat and buy-side upgrades are still rolling in (JPM, Bernstein).  Studies of “post-earnings-announcement drift” (PEAD) show a mild positive autocorrelation for roughly two weeks → +2 pts.  
2. Wave-season booking disclosures sometimes arrive mid-February; management tone is bullish.  Surprise upside headline risk favours a higher price → +1 pt.  
3. Share-repurchase fire-power ($1.8 bn authorised) gives the board capacity to absorb dips → +1 pt.

Downward pressures (–)
1. Mean-reversion: the stock is already 12 % above its 20-day MA; RSI ~62.  About half the historical windows that began with a ≥10 % one-day jump finished lower eight sessions later → –2 pts.  
2. Macro-data risk: Hot CPI on 13 Feb would re-ignite rate fears, pressuring leveraged travel stocks → –1 pt.  
3. Limited new scheduled catalysts: no earnings or investor conference before 14 Feb, so the news vacuum can invite profit-taking → –1 pt.

Net adjustment: +1 pt relative to the 52 % reference ⇒ 53 %.

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor: 52 % (“issuer-specific eight-day base rate”).  
• Aggregate qualitative adjustment: +1 % (rounded) for slight momentum edge.  
• Plausibility check: 53 % corresponds to odds of 1.13 : 1—consistent with a modest directional tilt, not an outsized conviction.  Given daily σ ≈ 2.5 %, even a small drift advantage can justify a one-percentage-point lift.

Outside View Prediction:
53 %
