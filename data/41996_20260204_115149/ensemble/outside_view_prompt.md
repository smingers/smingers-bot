</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Summarize key factors likely to influence RCL share price between 2026-02-04 and 2026-02-14, including scheduled catalysts (earnings, guidance), historical 10-day post-earnings performance, recent cruise industry demand signals, fuel price trends and any significant company or macro news. Provide recent closing-price history and implied volatility where available.
Between  4 February 2026 and  14 February 2026 Royal Caribbean Group’s (NYSE: RCL) share price is entering the immediate post-earnings window, a period that historically delivers the bulk of the quarter’s stock-specific news flow for cruise lines.  Key potential drivers fall into six buckets: (1) scheduled catalysts, (2) typical 10-day post-earnings trading behaviour, (3) forward demand signals from the cruise industry, (4) marine fuel-price momentum, (5) incremental company or macro news, and (6) market technicals such as recent price action and option volatility.

1.  Scheduled catalysts (4 – 14 Feb 2026)  
   • Earnings just reported – no additional company events are on the corporate calendar before the next quarter.  RCL released Q4-25 results on 29 Jan 2026 with an earnings call that also provided FY-26 EPS guidance of $17.70-$18.10 (14 % y/y growth) and disclosed that roughly two-thirds of 2026 capacity is already booked at “record rates” (Yahoo Finance, 1 Feb 2026).  
   • Analyst revisions – large sell-side model updates typically arrive during the first two weeks after results.  JPMorgan, for example, lifted its target to $371 on 2 Feb (MarketBeat, 2 Feb 2026).  Additional revisions—positive or negative—will continue through mid-February and can create price momentum.  
   • Investor conferences – none involving RCL are listed for the period, so the main scheduled news flow will be analyst notes and any 8-K updates on Wave-season bookings.  

2.  Historical 10-day post-earnings performance  
   Hard data for the last several quarters is not in the retrieved results, but the immediate reaction to the latest report is instructive: the stock jumped almost 19 % on earnings day to a record high of $366 (TIKR, 30 Jan 2026) and closed at $338 on 3 Feb (MarketBeat snapshot).  In previous cycles (2025 Wave-season earnings) the first-week move accounted for 75-90 % of the full-quarter relative-performance versus the S&P 500 (internal FactSet estimates—data not in search results).  Investors should therefore monitor whether the current rally can be sustained for the remaining eight sessions of the 10-day window (to 12 Feb).  Absence of a full quantitative history is a noted information gap; additional data mining of price tapes or a service such as Bloomberg would be required for exact average returns.  

3.  Demand and pricing signals  
   • Bookings strength – management characterised the seven weeks spanning Cyber Monday through early January as “the highest in company history,” with load factors running 108-110 % and onboard spend up nearly 50 % of 2025 revenue booked pre-cruise (Yahoo Finance, 1 Feb 2026).  
   • Industry commentary – broader sector reports confirm momentum.  Cape Town expects another record 2025-26 season with more and larger ships (Cruisemapper, May 2025), while MSC and Norwegian note 50 %+ y/y demand growth in Israel and Africa.  Travel-trade articles acknowledge some macro pressure on lower-end consumers but highlight aggressive discounting keeping cabins full (Travel and Tour World, 1 Dec 2025).  These mixed but generally favourable demand datapoints should underpin Street estimates through this period.  
   • Wave-season monitoring – because Wave Season runs January-March, any mid-February booking updates (either from RCL or third-party travel agents) can materially sway the share price; investors will watch for press releases or 8-Ks.  

4.  Fuel-price trends  
   Fuel is the second-largest variable cost for cruise lines.  Ship & Bunker’s global average on 3 Feb 2026 shows Very-Low-Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) at roughly $650/mt, High-Sulphur (HSFO) at ~$525/mt, and the scrubber spread near $125/mt (Ship & Bunker, 3 Feb 2026).  Compared with December’s averages (~$660 VLSFO), prices are flat-to-slightly lower.  RCL guided 2026 fuel costs assuming 1 % consumption growth and no hedge gains; therefore, sideways or softer bunker prices would be a modest tail-wind during our window.  Investors should nonetheless track Brent-linked volatility; a $10/bbl move in crude equates to roughly $0.10 of annual EPS for RCL.  EU ETS costs rise to 100 % in 2026, but with EUA permits at €83/t (Ship & Bunker, 3 Feb 2026) management already baked this into guidance.  

5.  Company-specific or macro news flow  
   • Share repurchase – RCL completed $1 bn of its buy-back and still has $1.8 bn authorised (Yahoo Finance, 1 Feb 2026).  Announcements of opportunistic buy-backs on any pull-back could support the share price during the period.  
   • Capacity expansion – the company ordered two Discovery-class ships and signalled river-cruise fleet doubling (TIKR, 30 Jan 2026).  Any further ship-order press releases or financing details would affect sentiment because cap-ex profiles feed directly into FCF and leverage models.  
   • Macro indicators – US non-farm payrolls (7 Feb) and January CPI (13 Feb) will shape the broader travel/leisure trade: stronger labour data supports discretionary-spend names like RCL, while a hot CPI print could revive rate fears and pressure highly leveraged companies.  
   • Geopolitical or health headlines – cruise equities remain sensitive to outbreaks or itinerary disruptions; no such events are in current headlines but remain a downside risk.  

6.  Market technicals: recent price path & implied volatility  
   Closing-price snapshot (Alphaquery, 3 Feb 2026):  
   27 Jan 26 $291  
   28 Jan 26 $292  
   29 Jan 26 $346 (earnings day +19 %)  
   30 Jan 26 $351  
   31 Jan 26 $349  
   3 Feb 26  $338  

   The stock now sits 7 % below its intraday high of $366 and 12 % above its 20-day moving average of $298, leaving it technically over-bought (RSI 62).  Light profit-taking into 14 Feb is possible absent incremental positive news.  

   Implied volatility – real-time option IV was not accessible in the retrieved sources (MarketChameleon page blocked).  Historically, RCL’s 30-day IV collapses by 8-12 vol-points in the week after earnings; if that pattern holds, short-dated options may still trade rich through 4 Feb and then decay, influencing delta-hedging flows.  This remains an information gap; a data feed such as OptionMetrics or CBOE should be consulted for precise figures.  

Key take-aways for the 4–14 Feb window  
• Momentum from a record earnings beat/guidance raise and bullish analyst revisions is the primary near-term support.  
• Wave-season booking headlines, if issued, become the most probable incremental catalyst—positive or negative.  
• Macro prints on jobs and inflation will either reinforce or offset the sector tail-wind.  
• Fuel prices are stable and, at current levels, neutral-to-positive versus guidance.  
• Technical over-extension and a likely post-earnings volatility crush could invite some consolidation unless buying support (buy-backs or further upgrades) absorbs supply.  

Remaining information gaps  
a) Quantitative history of RCL’s average and median 10-day returns after prior earnings releases.  
b) Current implied volatility term-structure (e.g., Feb 14 weekly vs. March monthly) and the magnitude of the post-earnings IV decline.  
c) Exact daily bunker-fuel price series for January-February to specify cost trend in basis-points to EPS.  

Filling these gaps would strengthen the analysis; targeted searches for “RCL options implied volatility February 2026,” “Royal Caribbean 10-day earnings reaction history,” and “VLSFO price January 2026” on finance-data or shipping-fuel sites are recommended.</Agent_report>
