Analysis:
RCL’s share price direction over the next ten calendar days (through 14 Feb 2026) will be driven mainly by:  
• Any fresh earnings guidance or preliminary Q1 booking commentary (the company’s Q4/FY-25 earnings release is expected mid-February).  
• Industry demand signals—Wave Season booking reports from cruise lines and travel agencies.  
• Macro variables important to cruise stocks: oil-fuel price moves, Treasury-yield/interest-rate expectations, and any geopolitical events that could disrupt itineraries.  
• Broader equity-market tone, because RCL is a high-beta discretionary-travel name.  
Therefore the most relevant articles are those giving: 1) updated booking/occupancy/price-yield commentary, 2) analyst upgrades/downgrades, 3) information on the forthcoming earnings date and any pre-announcements, 4) sector-wide cruise or travel demand news, and 5) macro or market sentiment changes specifically cited as affecting RCL. These sources will help assess whether positive catalysts are likely to push the 14 Feb close above the 4 Feb close.
