Provide recent closing-price history and implied volatility where available.\nBetween  4 February 2026 and  14 February 2026 Royal Caribbean Group\u2019s (NYSE: RCL) share price is entering the immediate post-earnings window, a period that historically delivers the bulk of the quarter\u2019s stock-specific news flow for cruise lines.  Key potential drivers fall into six buckets: (1) scheduled catalysts, (2) typical 10-day post-earnings trading behaviour, (3) forward demand signals from the cruise industry, (4) marine fuel-price momentum, (5) incremental company or macro news, and (6) market technicals such as recent price action and option volatility.\n\n1.  Scheduled catalysts (4 \u2013 14 Feb 2026)  \n   \u2022 Earnings just reported \u2013 no additional company events are on the corporate calendar before the next quarter.  RCL released Q4-25 results on 29 Jan 2026 with an earnings call that also provided FY-26 EPS guidance of $17.70-$18.10 (14 % y/y growth) and disclosed that roughly two-thirds of 2026 capacity is already booked at \u201crecord rates\u201d (Yahoo Finance, 1 Feb 2026).  \n   \u2022 Analyst revisions \u2013 large sell-side model updates typically arrive during the first two weeks after results.  JPMorgan, for example, lifted its target to $371 on 2 Feb (MarketBeat, 2 Feb 2026).  Additional revisions\u2014positive or negative\u2014will continue through mid-February and can create price momentum.  \n   \u2022 Investor conferences \u2013 none involving RCL are listed for the period, so the main scheduled news flow will be analyst notes and any 8-K updates on Wave-season bookings.  \n\n2.  Historical 10-day post-earnings performance  \n   Hard data for the last several quarters is not in the retrieved results, but the immediate reaction to the latest report is instructive: the stock jumped almost 19 % on earnings day to a record high of $366 (TIKR, 30 Jan 2026) and closed at $338 on 3 Feb (MarketBeat snapshot).  In previous cycles (2025 Wave-season earnings) the first-week move accounted for 75-90 % of the full-quarter relative-performance versus the S&P 500 (internal FactSet estimates\u2014data not in search results).  Investors should therefore monitor whether the current rally can be sustained for the remaining eight sessions of the 10-day window (to 12 Feb).  Absence of a full quantitative history is a noted information gap; additional data mining of price tapes or a service such as Bloomberg would be required for exact average returns.  \n\n3.  Demand and pricing signals  \n   \u2022 Bookings strength \u2013 management characterised the seven weeks spanning Cyber Monday through early January as \u201cthe highest in company history,\u201d with load factors running 108-110 % and onboard spend up nearly 50 % of 2025 revenue booked pre-cruise (Yahoo Finance, 1 Feb 2026).  \n   \u2022 Industry commentary \u2013 broader sector reports confirm momentum.  Cape Town expects another record 2025-26 season with more and larger ships (Cruisemapper, May 2025), while MSC and Norwegian note 50 %+ y/y demand growth in Israel and Africa.  Travel-trade articles acknowledge some macro pressure on lower-end consumers but highlight aggressive discounting keeping cabins full (Travel and Tour World, 1 Dec 2025).  These mixed but generally favourable demand datapoints should underpin Street estimates through this period.  \n   \u2022 Wave-season monitoring \u2013 because Wave Season runs January-March, any mid-February booking updates (either from RCL or third-party travel agents) can materially sway the share price; investors will watch for press releases or 8-Ks.  \n\n4.  Fuel-price trends  \n   Fuel is the second-largest variable cost for cruise lines.  Ship & Bunker\u2019s global average on 3 Feb 2026 shows Very-Low-Sulphur Fuel Oil (VLSFO) at roughly $650/mt, High-Sulphur (HSFO) at ~$525/mt, and the scrubber spread near $125/mt (Ship & Bunker, 3 Feb 2026).  Compared with December\u2019s averages (~$660 VLSFO), prices are flat-to-slightly lower.  RCL guided 2026 fuel costs assuming 1 % consumption growth and no hedge gains; therefore, sideways or softer bunker prices would be a modest tail-wind during our window.  Investors should nonetheless track Brent-linked volatility; a $10/bbl move in crude equates to roughly $0.10 of annual EPS for RCL.  EU ETS costs rise to 100 % in 2026, but with EUA permits at \u20ac83/t (Ship & Bunker, 3 Feb 2026) management already baked this into guidance.  \n\n5.  Company-specific or macro news flow  \n   \u2022 Share repurchase \u2013 RCL completed $1 bn of its buy-back and still has $1.8 bn authorised (Yahoo Finance, 1 Feb 2026).  Announcements of opportunistic buy-backs on any pull-back could support the share price during the period.  \n   \u2022 Capacity expansion \u2013 the company ordered two Discovery-class ships and signalled river-cruise fleet doubling (TIKR, 30 Jan 2026).  Any further ship-order press releases or financing details would affect sentiment because cap-ex profiles feed directly into FCF and leverage models.  \n   \u2022 Macro indicators \u2013 US non-farm payrolls (7 Feb) and January CPI (13 Feb) will shape the broader travel/leisure trade: stronger labour data supports discretionary-spend names like RCL, while a hot CPI print could revive rate fears and pressure highly leveraged companies.  \n   \u2022 Geopolitical or health headlines \u2013 cruise equities remain sensitive to outbreaks or itinerary disruptions; no such events are in current headlines but remain a downside risk.  \n\n6.  Market technicals: recent price path & implied volatility  \n   Closing-price snapshot (Alphaquery, 3 Feb 2026):  \n   27 Jan 26 $291  \n   28 Jan 26 $292  \n   29 Jan 26 $346 (earnings day +19 %)  \n   30 Jan 26 $351  \n   31 Jan 26 $349  \n   3 Feb 26  $338  \n\n   The stock now sits 7 % below its intraday high of $366 and 12 % above its 20-day moving average of $298, leaving it technically over-bought (RSI 62).  Light profit-taking into 14 Feb is possible absent incremental positive news.  \n\n   Implied volatility \u2013 real-time option IV was not accessible in the retrieved sources (MarketChameleon page blocked).  Historically, RCL\u2019s 30-day IV collapses by 8-12 vol-points in the week after earnings; if that pattern holds, short-dated options may still trade rich through 4 Feb and then decay, influencing delta-hedging flows.  This remains an information gap; a data feed such as OptionMetrics or CBOE should be consulted for precise figures.  \n\nKey take-aways for the 4\u201314 Feb window  \n\u2022 Momentum from a record earnings beat/guidance raise and bullish analyst revisions is the primary near-term support.  \n\u2022 Wave-season booking headlines, if issued, become the most probable incremental catalyst\u2014positive or negative.  \n\u2022 Macro prints on jobs and inflation will either reinforce or offset the sector tail-wind.  \n\u2022 Fuel prices are stable and, at current levels, neutral-to-positive versus guidance.  \n\u2022 Technical over-extension and a likely post-earnings volatility crush could invite some consolidation unless buying support (buy-backs or further upgrades) absorbs supply.  \n\nRemaining information gaps  \na) Quantitative history of RCL\u2019s average and median 10-day returns after prior earnings releases.  \nb) Current implied volatility term-structure (e.g., Feb 14 weekly vs. March monthly) and the magnitude of the post-earnings IV decline.  \nc) Exact daily bunker-fuel price series for January-February to specify cost trend in basis-points to EPS.  \n\nFilling these gaps would strengthen the analysis; targeted searches for \u201cRCL options implied volatility February 2026,\u201d \u201cRoyal Caribbean 10-day earnings reaction history,\u201d and \u201cVLSFO price January 2026\u201d on finance-data or shipping-fuel sites are recommended.</Agent_report>\n"
