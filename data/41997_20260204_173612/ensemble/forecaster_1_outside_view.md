   - Suitability: HIGH
   - Rationale: Most directly relevant timeframe, captures current volatility regime
   - Data: Shows daily changes ranging from approximately -2.5% to +3.5%, with most days showing smaller movements

2. **Utility sector stocks over 7-trading-day periods**
   - Suitability: MODERATE
   - Rationale: Sector-specific but less company-specific
   - Data: Limited specific data available, though utilities generally less volatile than broader market

3. **PCG price movements over 7-trading-day windows historically**
   - Suitability: HIGH
   - Rationale: Directly relevant company and timeframe
   - Data: Can be inferred from historical data showing typical weekly volatility

4. **PCG behavior around earnings announcements**
   - Suitability: VERY HIGH
   - Rationale: Earnings release on Feb 12 falls within our prediction window (Feb 4-13)
   - Data: Options-implied ~4.7% one-day move, historical composite 3.91% average absolute move

**Selected Reference Class**: PCG behavior around earnings announcements, supplemented by recent daily volatility patterns.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 7 trading days (Feb 4 to Feb 13, 2026)
- Feb 4 (Wed) - starting point
- Feb 5-11 (Thu-Wed) - 6 trading days pre-earnings
- Feb 12 (Thu) - Q4 2025 earnings release (pre-market)
- Feb 13 (Fri) - final day, includes post-earnings trading

**Critical Event**: Earnings release on Feb 12 means the prediction window captures:
- 6 days of pre-earnings trading (potential drift/positioning)
- 2 days of post-earnings reaction (Feb 12-13)

**Historical Patterns:**
- Recent daily volatility (Nov 2025-Feb 2026): -2.20% to +3.42%
- Options market implies ~4.7% one-day earnings move
- Historical composite: 3.91% average absolute earnings move
- Recent trend: Stock up from $15.34 (Feb 3) to $15.87 (Feb 4) = +3.42%
- FY-24 earnings (Feb 13, 2025): -1.1% next session

**Seven-day movement patterns from historical data:**
- Jan 29-Feb 4, 2026: $15.16 → $15.87 = +4.68%
- Jan 22-29: Can be calculated from data as modest positive
- Dec-Jan periods show mixed 5-7 day windows, typically ±3-5%

## (d) Justification

The question asks whether PCG will close higher on Feb 13 than Feb 4 ($15.87). Several factors create a complex probability assessment:

**Bullish Factors:**
1. **Positive momentum**: Stock just gained 3.42% on Feb 4, showing recent strength
2. **Analyst optimism**: Consensus "Buy" with average PT $20.35 vs $15.50 spot (31% upside implied)
3. **Undervaluation**: Morningstar estimates 17% undervalued at $19.50 fair value
4. **Pre-earnings positioning**: Institutional investors may accumulate ahead of Feb 12 earnings
5. **Recent upgrades**: Wells Fargo, TD Cowen, Morgan Stanley all bullish in January 2026
6. **Growth narrative**: 9% annual earnings growth expected, constructive regulatory environment

**Bearish Factors:**
1. **Earnings uncertainty**: Q4 results could disappoint; historical Feb earnings showed -1.1% reaction in 2025
2. **Recent volatility**: Stock has shown -2.20% down days recently
3. **High debt**: 1.87 debt-to-equity ratio creates financial risk
4. **Regulatory overhang**: SB 254 ROE caps, SPD-37 cost recovery tightening
5. **YTD performance**: Down 4.54% for 2026 as of Feb 3

**Key Probabilistic Considerations:**

The earnings release on Feb 12 is the dominant factor. With 6 pre-earnings days and 2 post-earnings days:

- **Scenario 1 (Positive)**: Pre-earnings drift adds 1-2%, earnings beat adds 2-4% on Feb 12-13. Total: +3-6% → Close above $15.87
- **Scenario 2 (Neutral/Mixed)**: Modest pre-earnings movement (±1%), earnings reaction muted or negative (-1% to +2%) → Close near $15.87
- **Scenario 3 (Negative)**: Pre-earnings weakness (-1-2%), earnings disappoint (-3-5%) → Close below $15.87

**Base Rate Calculation:**
From recent 7-day periods in historical data:
- Approximately 50-60% of rolling 7-day windows show positive returns
- However, earnings volatility (±4.7% implied) dominates typical daily moves (±2%)
- With earnings on day 7 of 9 (Feb 12), the question becomes: will any pre-earnings gains plus earnings reaction exceed zero?

Given:
- Positive recent momentum (+3.42% on Feb 4)
- Bullish analyst consensus and fair value gap
- But uncertain earnings outcome and historical -1.1% last February
- Options market pricing 4.7% absolute move (could be up or down)

The probability slightly favors an upward close due to recent momentum and analyst optimism, but earnings uncertainty creates substantial risk.

## Outside View Calibration

**Tethering to Available Data:**
- Recent 7-day windows: ~50-55% positive historically
- Current momentum: Strong (+3.42% on Feb 4, +4.68% over prior 7 days)
- Earnings binary: Options imply ~50% chance of up vs down, but magnitude matters
- Analyst sentiment: Strongly bullish (60% Buy, 0% Sell, +31% upside to targets)

**Calibration Logic:**
Starting from a base 50% (random walk), adjustments:
- Recent positive momentum: +8-10%
- Bullish analyst consensus and undervaluation: +5-7%
- Earnings uncertainty (could go either way): -3-5%
- Strong recent single-day gain may mean pullback risk: -2-3%

Net adjustment: +8-9% from base 50%

However, I must consider:
- The stock just jumped 3.42%, which might be partially mean-reverting
- Earnings on Feb 12 create high uncertainty
- 7 trading days with a major catalyst = not a simple drift scenario

**Final Calibration:**
The combination of positive momentum, bullish consensus, and undervaluation suggests better than 50-50 odds, but earnings uncertainty prevents high confidence. A probability in the 57-62% range seems appropriate.

Given the strong recent momentum (+3.42% on Feb 4, +4.68% over 7 days) and overwhelmingly bullish analyst sentiment (60% Buy, 0% Sell, median target 32% above current), offset by earnings uncertainty, I calibrate to approximately 59%.
