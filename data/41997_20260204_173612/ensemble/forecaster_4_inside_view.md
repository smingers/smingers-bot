Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)

1. StockAnalysis PCG price table (4 Feb 2026).  Factual: close = $15.87; recent trading range $14.8–16.3.  High-quality raw data, no opinions.
2. GuruFocus note on PG&E/Itron partnership (3 Feb 2026).  Factual: collaboration details, Altman-Z = 0.47, debt/equity = 1.87; Opinion: “path toward long-term improvement.”  Medium quality (editorial + data).
3. LA Times wildfire-tech venture (26 Jan 2026).  Factual: $100 m Emberpoint JV.  Quality: good newspaper; economic impact small, mostly reputational.  
4. OregonLive grid-demand story (26 Jan 2026).  Factual: regional power-demand pressures; no direct PCG numbers.  Low relevance, high quality.
5. Zacks/Nasdaq analyst-target article (23 Dec 2025).  Factual: mean target $21.32; upward EPS revisions (+0.1%); Zacks #2 Buy.  Medium quality, transparent methodology.
6. Benzinga price-forecast piece (10 Nov 2025).  Mix of facts (valuation multiples) and opinion (bull/bear cases). Medium quality; horizon > question window.
7. Historical analyst-rating compilations (Oct 2025) from Defense World, Markets Insider.  Provide consensus $20 target, balance of Buy/Hold. Data sound; stale for 7-day horizon.
8. Stockpulse print (3 Feb 2026) PCG-PA preferred share tick: down 0.7%.  Very near-dated but thinly traded class; minor signal.
9. Misc. AskNews items (foreign stocks, Hang Seng, etc.).  No direct bearing on PCG.  Ignored.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighting vs binary “higher by 13 Feb”):

Moderate-positive evidence  
• Consensus 12-mo targets 18–22 $ (Zacks/Nasdaq, Goldman, UBS) > spot 15.87 $ → suggests undervaluation; modest drift upward expected.  
• Zacks Rank #2 with fresh positive EPS revision → historical base-rate: ranks #1/#2 beat market ~55-60% next month.

Moderate-negative evidence  
• Altman-Z < 1 (GuruFocus) and persistent wildfire liability headlines keep risk premium high; bad earnings headline could pull stock down.  
• 4 Feb close already +3.4% intraday ⇒ short-term mean-reversion tendency in utilities (empirical hit-rate ~48% week after large up-day).

Weak evidence  
• Emberpoint JV and grid-edge Itron deal are reputational pluses but unlikely to sway price within seven sessions.  
• Insider net selling (Oct 2025) stale; minimal influence.  
• Broader market tone mixed (utilities often defensive). Small effect.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon = 7 trading days (5–13 Feb 2026).  If horizon were halved (to 3–4 days) I’d trim probability toward 50% (less time for drift).  If doubled (to 2 weeks) I’d raise probability a couple points (more time for mean reversion to play plus post-earnings upside chance).

(d) Justification & inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (large-cap utility, 1-week): 49%.  
Shifters:  
+2 pts Analyst/EPS-revision momentum (moderate, persistent).  
+2 pts Valuation discount vs targets.  
–2 pts Recent big up-day mean-reversion.  
–0.5 pt Earnings-event left-tail from wildfire / cost surprises.  
Net ≈ +1.5 pts ⇒ round to 51%.

Probability calibration
I expect that in 51 out of 100 similar 7-day windows, PCG will close higher than on 4 Feb 2026.

Checklist:
1. Criterion = “PCG close on 13 Feb 2026 higher than $15.87 close on 4 Feb.”  
2. Base rate 49 %; final 51 % remains anchored.  
3. Consistency: 51/100 times, price ends higher → reasonable.  
4. Key evidence: a) Zacks #2 + EPS upward revision; b) analyst mean target $21; c) 3.4 % uptick already logged; d) earnings on 12 Feb raises two-sided risk.  
5. Blind-spot: large wildfire lawsuit or earnings miss on 12 Feb could send shares < $15 quickly; would swing probability to ~35 %.  
6. Status-quo (no big move) remains plausible; short horizon favors near-coin-flip estimate.

Probability: 51%
