Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. StockAnalysis.com daily price table (Feb 4 2026 close = $15.87).  
   • Purely historical trading data pulled from the exchange.  High-quality factual source; no opinions.  
2. Macrotrends weekly/annual price table (latest close Feb 3 2026 = $15.34, 52-wk high/low, YTD perf).  
   • Historical data again; macro‐site scrapes from public feeds.  Good for long-run context; minimal interpretation.  
3. Nasdaq page (broken scrape).  • No usable data.  
4. Finviz / PR Newswire scholarship press-release (Feb 3 2026).  
   • Human-interest story; no bearing on short-term price action.  Ignore for price forecasting.  
5. Meyka blog post (Dec 4 2025) citing “buy” consensus and $21 median target.  
   • Two-month-old; numbers largely stale for a 9-day horizon.  Treat as low weight.  
6. Morningstar “Best Utilities Stocks” (Jan 7 2026).  
   • Reputable independent analyst; factual metrics (P/FV = 0.83, FV $19.50). Opinion that PCG is undervalued.  Useful to gauge longer-term drift but only weakly relevant to a one-week move.  
7. Agent report (4 Feb 2026).  
   • Compiles regulatory, earnings-date (Q4/FY-25 results pre-mkt 12 Feb 2026), options-implied ±4.7 % one-day move, and analyst sentiment.  Mixed fact & interpretation; facts are sourced and generally credible.  For an outside-view (base-rate) build we largely set this aside, but note that an earnings event occurs inside the forecast window.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes for a 7-trading-day horizon:  
1. All U.S. equities weekly returns (very broad).  
2. Regulated-utility stocks weekly returns (beta ≈ 0.55, lower vol).  
3. PCG’s own historical 7-day returns (company-specific).  

Choice: The question concerns one specific utility during an ordinary 7-trading-day window; therefore the most informative but still “outside” reference is class 2—regulated utility stocks’ weekly return distribution—because it captures sector-specific volatility yet doesn’t rely on inside knowledge of this particular week’s catalysts.

Empirical stylised facts for U.S. utilities (1990-2025, XLU ETF proxy):  
• Mean weekly total return ≈ +0.13 %.  
• Weekly standard deviation ≈ 2.0 %.  
• Fraction of weeks finishing higher than start ≈ 52 %.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Time until resolution: 9 calendar days / 7 trading sessions (Feb 5-13).  
A drift of +0.13 % with σweek = 2 % translates to a z-score of 0.13 / 2 = 0.065 and, via the normal CDF, to Pr(up week) ≈ 52.6 %.

(d) Justification  
• Historical drift for utilities is small and positive, giving a slight tilt toward a higher close.  
• Seven sessions is too short for valuation arguments (Morningstar fair value) to dominate random walk noise; volatility overwhelms drift.  
• Scheduled Q4/FY-25 earnings on 12 Feb inject event risk, but from an outside-view perspective we merely note that the direction of the earnings reaction is 50/50.  Options-implied one-day move (±4.7 %) raises variance but not the sign expectation.  
• No exogenous shocks (rate-case ruling, wildfire headlines) are scheduled between now and the 13th, so the sector-wide base rate is the best neutral anchor.

Outside view calibration:
Starting base rate (utilities weekly): 52 %.  
Small upward adjustment (+1 pp) because PCG is trading 17 % below Morningstar fair value and analysts’ median target is > 30 % above spot, suggesting a mild positive drift bias even over short intervals.  
No material adjustments for macro-events (Fed meeting already behind us, CPI not until 14 Feb).  
Hence calibrated outside-view probability = 52 % + 1 % ≈ 53 %.

Outside View Prediction:
53 % probability that PCG’s market close price on 2026-02-13 will be higher than on 2026-02-04.
