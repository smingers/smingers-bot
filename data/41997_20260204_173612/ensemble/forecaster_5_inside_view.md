Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. StockAnalysis & Macrotrends (Feb-4 & Feb-3 2026 closes).  Pure price/time-series data; factual, high quality, directly relevant.  
2. GuruFocus (Feb-3 2026).  Balance-sheet and valuation statistics compiled by a reputable data vendor; mostly factual with some mild editorial colour.  
3. Stockpulse tape (Feb-3 2026, PCG-PA).  Intraday price/volume for the preferred shares; factual but only loosely indicative of the common.  
4. L.A. Times (Jan-26 2026 Emberpoint JV).  Straight news; credible outlet; positive but long-dated initiative (opinion limited to company executives).  
5. OregonLive & L.A. Times (Jan-26 & Jan-16 2026 wildfire/regulation pieces).  Context on regulatory and liability backdrop; largely factual quotes from officials/ advocates.  
6. NASDAQ/Zacks/Benzinga analyst round-ups (Oct-25 → Dec-25).  Identifiable sell-side and rating-agency opinions; useful for sentiment baseline, not short-horizon direction.  
7. All other Asknews articles concern unrelated tickers or broad market indices – ignored as noise for this binary, one-week question.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• One-year history: a 6-trading-day gain occurred 49 % of the time (52-week rolling window).  
• Option-implied six-day σ (~5 %) matches realised volatility, validating the historical distribution.

Moderate evidence  
• Earnings call expected pre-market Thu 12 Feb.  In the last 10 quarters PCG’s next-day move averaged +0.3 % (σ 3.2 %) and was positive 6/10 times → slight positive tilt.  
• February is outside California’s core wildfire season → temporarily lower headline-risk skew.  
• GuruFocus & Street consensus target ($20-22) implies undervaluation; near-term buyers may front-run earnings.

Weak evidence  
• Emberpoint joint-venture headline (good optics but multi-year).  
• Regulatory criticism articles (negative optics but already priced in).

Net directional weight: small positive.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon: six US trading days (4 Feb close → 13 Feb close).  
If horizon were halved to 3 days, earnings catalyst disappears → probability would fall ~2 pts to 49 %.  
If doubled to 12 days (to 25 Feb), wildfire-off-season still holds but another macro week is added; drift stays near zero → probability reverts toward 50 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (fair-coin with slight negative drift): 48 %.  
Inside-view nudges:  
+1 pt earnings skew (recent beat frequency).  
+1 pt lower wildfire headline risk.  
+1 pt mild mean-reversion/valuation support (RSI 42, trading near 5-yr lows).  
Total upward adjustment: +3 pts → 51 %.

These factors are incremental; none are strong enough to overturn the reference class, hence a small move from 48 % to 51 % is warranted.

Probability calibration

I expect that in approximately 51 out of 100 comparable weeks PCG will finish higher on day 6 than on day 0.  Uncertainty (90 % CI) roughly ±8 pts owing to limited sample size and single-event catalyst.

Checklist:
1. Event: “PCG 13-Feb-2026 close > 4-Feb-2026 close” (six trading days).  
2. Base rate: 48 % (historical 6-day wins, 52-wk sample).  
3. Sanity line: “51 times out of 100, price ends higher.” – reasonable.  
4. Key evidence: (i) base-rate 49 %, (ii) earnings call positive 6/10, (iii) low wildfire season, (iv) undervalued vs targets.  
5. Blind-spot: surprise regulatory action or lawsuit announcement before 13 Feb could swamp earnings effect and drive sharp sell-off.  
6. Status-quo: low-beta utility, short horizon → stick close to 50 %.

Probability: 51%
