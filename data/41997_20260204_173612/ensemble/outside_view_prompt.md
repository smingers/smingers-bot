</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Summarize key PG&E news, earnings schedule, regulatory or wildfire developments since Jan 2025 and analyst expectations through mid-Feb 2026; include historical price reaction to February earnings releases.
Pacific Gas & Electric (NYSE: PCG) has generated a steady stream of operating, regulatory and capital-markets developments since January 2025.  The items most relevant to investors heading into the next earnings release (pre-market 12 February 2026) fall into five buckets: earnings timing and sell-side expectations, wildfire-fund legislation and cost-recovery rules, operational progress (especially undergrounding), Street sentiment, and how the stock typically trades around its February results.

1. Earnings calendar and consensus through mid-February 2026  
• Management has confirmed that FY-25 / 4Q-25 results will be released before the bell on Thursday 12 Feb 2026, followed by an 11:00 a.m. ET conference call (PG&E investor “Events & Presentations” page, accessed 4 Feb 2026).  
• StockInvest’s feed shows a $0.38 core-EPS estimate for 4Q-25 and a $7.053 bn revenue estimate (StockInvest.us, 4 Feb 2026).  The same source records the most recent quarterly beats and misses (Oct-25 beat, Jul-25 and Apr-25 small misses).  
• TradingEconomics (data carried forward from previous work) still lists $1.50 FY-25 and $1.63 FY-26 core-EPS consensus, essentially matching management’s own FY-26 guidance of $1.62–1.66.  
• Option-implied one-day volatility sits near 4.7 % (Optionslam, pay-walled—figure unchanged from late-Jan).  
• A $0.05 quarterly dividend is payable 15 Jan 2026, continuing the 20 % payout-ratio glidepath.

2. Wildfire-liability legislation and the new Continuation Account  
• Senate Bill 254 was signed by Governor Newsom on 19 Sep 2025.  It creates an $18 bn “Continuation Account” to augment the 2019 $21 bn Wildfire Fund, extends the non-bypassable customer surcharge by ten years, and caps allowed ROE on the first $6 bn of wildfire-mitigation capex placed in service after 1 Jan 2026 (Energy News Beat, 21 Oct 2025; Daily Energy Insider, 12 Sep 2025).  
• Funding mechanics: rate-payers fund half via the existing surcharge; IOUs make a $3.9 bn up-front deposit plus $300 m a year in installments.  The California Earthquake Authority (CEA), acting as administrator, must file an adequacy study by 1 Apr 2026, after which the initial cash transfer schedule will be finalised (Wildfire Fund website, accessed 4 Feb 2026).  
• Until that study is filed, the exact timing of cash into the Continuation Account and therefore potential credit-metric relief for PG&E remains unknown—an explicit near-term information gap.

3. CPUC cost-recovery tightening and undergrounding progress  
• PG&E surpassed 1,000 miles of distribution line undergrounded as of 19 Nov 2025 (StockTitan dispatch).  Shares fell 2.66 % that day on concerns the milestone hinted at higher future capital intensity.  
• On 4 Dec 2025 the CPUC adopted Resolution SPD-37, which standardises data reporting under SB 884, requires a benefit-cost ratio ≥ 1.0 for undergrounding projects outside High-Fire-Threat Districts, and links cost recovery to annual audits (CPUC press release, 4 Dec 2025).  Tighter gate-keeping could slow annual mileage, but the resolution simultaneously increases visibility that prudently incurred costs will be rate-based.  
• The CPUC also:  
  – set the 2026 non-bypassable Wildfire Fund charge at $0.00591/kWh to raise $902 m (Stoel Rives Regulatory Update, 3 Dec 2025);  
  – approved $382 m of 2026 costs tied to Diablo Canyon’s extended operation, allocated among PG&E, Edison and SDG&E (California Regulatory Intelligence note, 25 Nov 2025).  
• Despite higher wildfire and Diablo Canyon riders, management is still guiding to a small average-rate decline for 2026 owing to $2.5 bn of O&M cuts and rising data-centre load (KRCR local report, 15 Aug 2025).

4. Operations, demand optionality and outer-year growth narrative  
• Management disclosed an 8.7 GW ten-year pipeline of hyperscale data-centre interconnection requests (Quantisnow flash, 27 May 2025).  The Rule 30 tariff allows customers to pre-fund transmission upgrades, insulating shareholders from capex drag.  The initial Rule 30 announcement (13 Feb 2025) triggered a one-day –3.53 % move (StockTitan).  
• Core EPS grew 10 % year-on-year in FY-23 and is guided up another ~10 % for 2025 (PG&E FY-23 release, 22 Feb 2024).  Guidance for 2026 implies a 7-9 % CAGR thereafter, underpinned by $73 bn of capital through 2030 (StockInvest transcript summary of 3Q-25 call).  
• Analyst sentiment remains constructive: Public.com’s real-time panel (10 analysts) shows 60 % Buy/Strong-Buy, 40 % Hold, 0 Sell with an average 12-month target of $20.35 versus a ~$15.50 spot price (snapshot 2 Feb 2026).  January 2026 actions include Wells Fargo (Overweight PT $23), TD Cowen (Buy $21) and Morgan Stanley (upgrade to Equal-Weight PT $20).  
• Outer-year estimates remain sparse in the public domain.  Simply Wall St projects EPS growth of roughly 10.7 % p.a. but does not provide a numeric FY-27 consensus (Simply Wall St forecast page, accessed 4 Feb 2026).  Barchart’s Zacks-powered feed also ends at FY-26.  Lack of an FY-27 street consensus is therefore a modelling blind-spot.

5. Historical share-price reaction to February earnings releases  
Event-study data around the February cadence are patchy:  
• FY-24 results (released 13 Feb 2025): PCG fell 1.1 % the next session (Hanenkratt Grain market note, cited in prior work).  
• FY-23 (22 Feb 2024): no freely available one-day reaction was retrieved, although the day’s press release shows FY-23 core EPS at the high-end of guidance and a guidance raise for 2024 (PG&E press release, 22 Feb 2024).  
• FY-22 (16 Feb 2023): same data gap—Google and Nasdaq pages that ordinarily house the information are currently blank or behind bot walls (prior work, 4 Feb 2026).  
• Optionslam’s composite indicates a 3.91 % average absolute move across 97 historical events but does not isolate February releases.  
Net result: traders must still rely on options-market implied moves (~4.7 %) or proprietary feeds; hard event-study numbers for 2024 and 2023 remain outstanding.

Key catalysts and risk skew into 12 Feb 2026  
Upside:  
• CEA’s 1 Apr 2026 adequacy study could accelerate cash into the SB 254 Continuation Account and pave the way for ratings upgrades;  
• evidence undergrounding costs per mile are holding below $3.1 m, validating the rate-base growth thesis;  
• first Rule 30 data-centre energisations (management flagged a 20 MW Equinix project for Jan 2026).  
Downside:  
• Resolution SPD-37 may slow the undergrounding ramp and undercut management’s 7–9 % EPS-growth promise;  
• the SB 254 ROE cap on the first $6 bn of mitigation capex could shave 20-40 bp from earned ROE unless offsetting CPUC relief is secured;  
• credit-rating upgrades are unlikely until Wildfire Fund replenishment mechanics are nailed down.

Remaining information gaps  
1. Precise PCG versus XLU one-day price moves for the FY-23 (22 Feb 2024) and FY-22 (16 Feb 2023) earnings releases;  
2. A publicly-available FY-27 EPS and revenue consensus;  
3. Exact initial funding schedule for the SB 254 Continuation Account—awaiting the CEA’s 1 Apr 2026 report.

Closing those holes would sharpen both near-term trading tactics and longer-dated DCF or relative-valuation models.  Nonetheless, since January 2025 PG&E has (i) locked in its next earnings date and consensus, (ii) secured legislative back-stop money via SB 254 albeit with still-unknown timing, (iii) seen the CPUC tighten undergrounding oversight, and (iv) preserved a cautiously bullish analyst stance.  The stock’s February earnings-day volatility history, however, remains only partially documented.</Agent_report>
