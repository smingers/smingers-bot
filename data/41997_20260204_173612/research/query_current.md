Analysis:
To judge whether PCG’s close on 13 Feb 2026 will beat the 04 Feb 2026 close we need to know:
• Any catalysts scheduled for the nine-day window (earnings release, regulatory decisions, rate-case rulings, wildfire-liability headlines, storms or blackouts).  
• Consensus expectations around those catalysts and whether they are viewed as positive or negative for PG&E’s cash-flow outlook.  
• Recent price/volume trend and analyst commentary since the last close.  
Therefore, the most relevant articles will discuss:  
1. PG&E’s next earnings-release date and preview of Q4-25 results or 2026 guidance.  
2. Wildfire litigation settlements, court rulings or new claims filed in early 2026.  
3. California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) actions on rate cases, Diablo Canyon or grid-hardening approvals.  
4. Weather events causing outages or public-safety power shutoffs that could drive near-term sentiment.  
5. Analyst upgrades/downgrades or options activity between 04 Feb and 13 Feb 2026.
