Analysis:
To judge whether PCG will finish higher on 2026-02-13 than on 2026-02-04, the outside view needs data on:  
• The stock’s medium-term price trend (6-12 months) and volatility;  
• Catalysts scheduled between the two dates, especially PG&E’s Q4-2025 earnings release (expected mid-Feb 2026), California regulatory or wildfire-liability developments, interest-rate moves, and S&P-500 sentiment;  
• How the market has historically reacted to PG&E’s February earnings and to major legal/regulatory headlines.  
Thus I first want price-history information, then very recent news and analyst commentary addressing upcoming catalysts.
