(PCG) closed at $15.98, up 0.2% over the past four weeks. Wall Street analysts project a mean price target of $21.32, indicating a potential upside of 33.42%, based on 14 short-term price targets with a standard deviation of $1.54. The lowest estimate is $18.00 (12.6% upside), while the most optimistic forecast reaches $25.00 (56.5% upside). The relatively low standard deviation suggests strong analyst consensus. However, the article cautions that price targets are often influenced by business incentives and may not reliably predict actual stock movements. Instead, the article highlights a stronger signal: upward revisions in earnings estimates, with the Zacks Consensus Estimate rising 0.1% over the past 30 days and no negative revisions. PCG holds a Zacks Rank #2 (Buy), placing it in the top 20% of over 4,000 ranked stocks based on earnings estimate trends. The article concludes that while price targets should be viewed skeptically, the combination of analyst agreement on earnings revisions and a strong Zacks Rank suggests potential near-term upside.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 23, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-street-analysts-believe-pge-pcg-could-rally-3342-heres-how-trade)\n\n**PG&E Corp. (PCG) Stock Price Prediction: 2025, 2026, 2030: Analyst Targets & Forecast * Benzinga**\nPG&E Corp. (PCG) stock is forecasted to see gradual improvement through 2026 and more significant upside by 2030, according to analysts and forecasting models like CoinCodex. The company, which provides electricity and natural gas to millions in Northern and Central California, has a market cap of $39.9 billion and a trailing P/E of 14.47, with a forward P/E of 9.62. Despite a 1-year return of -19% and a YTD decline of -19% in 2025, PCG holds a consensus 'Overweight' rating from 22 analysts, with an average price target of $20.82\u2014representing slight upside from current levels. The highest target is $26, the lowest $17, and recent targets average $20.67, suggesting a 26% near-term upside. The bull case highlights PG&E\u2019s diversified customer base, stable cash flow, dividends, and a favorable 0.78 PEG ratio (below 1, indicating potential undervaluation). The bear case emphasizes wildfire risks, including California\u2019s inverse condemnation law, which increases liability, and a low 0.41 quick ratio indicating high debt and vulnerability to future fire-related liabilities. PG&E filed for bankruptcy in 2019 due to over $30 billion in fire-related liabilities. While 2025 forecasts show limited movement, 2026 projections suggest growth driven by customer expansion and improved fire risk management. By 2030, a combination of financial recovery, low valuation, and reputation rebuilding may drive meaningful stock appreciation. However, long-term underperformance relative to the broader market is expected due to geographic constraints and persistent risk exposure. Investors are encouraged to consider PG&E as a value play, especially if the stock recovers to 2017 levels, but caution is advised due to ongoing systemic risks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 10, 2025 08:19 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/money/pge-corp-pcg-stock-price-prediction)\n\n**Price Over Earnings Overview: PG&E - PG&E (NYSE:PCG)**\nPG&E Inc. (NYSE:PCG) closed the current market session at $16.39, reflecting a 1.42% increase. However, over the past month, the stock declined by 2.69%, and over the past year, it dropped 20.09%. The company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio stands at 13.58, which is lower than the Electric Utilities industry average of 23.26. A lower P/E ratio may suggest that investors expect weaker future growth or that the stock is undervalued relative to its peers. Analysts caution that while the P/E ratio is a useful tool for evaluating market performance, it should not be used in isolation. Other factors, including industry trends, business cycles, and qualitative business conditions, must also be considered. Investors are advised to combine the P/E ratio with additional financial metrics and fundamental analysis before making investment decisions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 10:00 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/insights/news/25/11/48671806/price-over-earnings-overview-pg-e)\n\n**PCG December 12th Options Begin Trading**\nOn October 30, 2025, options for PG&E Corp (PCG) began trading with a December 12th expiration.

PG&E is a California-based regulated utility that transmits and distributes electricity and natural gas. The company\u2019s one-month return was 9.05%, but it lost 19.82% over the past 52 weeks, closing at $16.30 per share on October 23, 2025, with a market capitalization of $35.903 billion. Greenlight Capital noted that regulated utilities like PG&E operate as local monopolies with guaranteed returns on invested capital, including costs from disasters like California wildfires. However, political interference complicates cost recovery, increasing the company\u2019s cost of capital and leading to higher prices for California residents. Affordability has become a major political issue, prompting calls for reform.
