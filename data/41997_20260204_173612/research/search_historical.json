The items most relevant to investors heading into the next earnings release (pre-market 12 February 2026) fall into five buckets: earnings timing and sell-side expectations, wildfire-fund legislation and cost-recovery rules, operational progress (especially undergrounding), Street sentiment, and how the stock typically trades around its February results.\n\n1. Earnings calendar and consensus through mid-February 2026  \n\u2022 Management has confirmed that FY-25 / 4Q-25 results will be released before the bell on Thursday 12 Feb 2026, followed by an 11:00 a.m. ET conference call (PG&E investor \u201cEvents & Presentations\u201d page, accessed 4 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 StockInvest\u2019s feed shows a $0.38 core-EPS estimate for 4Q-25 and a $7.053 bn revenue estimate (StockInvest.us, 4 Feb 2026).  The same source records the most recent quarterly beats and misses (Oct-25 beat, Jul-25 and Apr-25 small misses).  \n\u2022 TradingEconomics (data carried forward from previous work) still lists $1.50 FY-25 and $1.63 FY-26 core-EPS consensus, essentially matching management\u2019s own FY-26 guidance of $1.62\u20131.66.  \n\u2022 Option-implied one-day volatility sits near 4.7 % (Optionslam, pay-walled\u2014figure unchanged from late-Jan).  \n\u2022 A $0.05 quarterly dividend is payable 15 Jan 2026, continuing the 20 % payout-ratio glidepath.\n\n2. Wildfire-liability legislation and the new Continuation Account  \n\u2022 Senate Bill 254 was signed by Governor Newsom on 19 Sep 2025.  It creates an $18 bn \u201cContinuation Account\u201d to augment the 2019 $21 bn Wildfire Fund, extends the non-bypassable customer surcharge by ten years, and caps allowed ROE on the first $6 bn of wildfire-mitigation capex placed in service after 1 Jan 2026 (Energy News Beat, 21 Oct 2025; Daily Energy Insider, 12 Sep 2025).  \n\u2022 Funding mechanics: rate-payers fund half via the existing surcharge; IOUs make a $3.9 bn up-front deposit plus $300 m a year in installments.  The California Earthquake Authority (CEA), acting as administrator, must file an adequacy study by 1 Apr 2026, after which the initial cash transfer schedule will be finalised (Wildfire Fund website, accessed 4 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 Until that study is filed, the exact timing of cash into the Continuation Account and therefore potential credit-metric relief for PG&E remains unknown\u2014an explicit near-term information gap.\n\n3. CPUC cost-recovery tightening and undergrounding progress  \n\u2022 PG&E surpassed 1,000 miles of distribution line undergrounded as of 19 Nov 2025 (StockTitan dispatch).  Shares fell 2.66 % that day on concerns the milestone hinted at higher future capital intensity.  \n\u2022 On 4 Dec 2025 the CPUC adopted Resolution SPD-37, which standardises data reporting under SB 884, requires a benefit-cost ratio \u2265 1.0 for undergrounding projects outside High-Fire-Threat Districts, and links cost recovery to annual audits (CPUC press release, 4 Dec 2025).  Tighter gate-keeping could slow annual mileage, but the resolution simultaneously increases visibility that prudently incurred costs will be rate-based.  \n\u2022 The CPUC also:  \n  \u2013 set the 2026 non-bypassable Wildfire Fund charge at $0.00591/kWh to raise $902 m (Stoel Rives Regulatory Update, 3 Dec 2025);  \n  \u2013 approved $382 m of 2026 costs tied to Diablo Canyon\u2019s extended operation, allocated among PG&E, Edison and SDG&E (California Regulatory Intelligence note, 25 Nov 2025).  \n\u2022 Despite higher wildfire and Diablo Canyon riders, management is still guiding to a small average-rate decline for 2026 owing to $2.5 bn of O&M cuts and rising data-centre load (KRCR local report, 15 Aug 2025).\n\n4. Operations, demand optionality and outer-year growth narrative  \n\u2022 Management disclosed an 8.7 GW ten-year pipeline of hyperscale data-centre interconnection requests (Quantisnow flash, 27 May 2025).  The Rule 30 tariff allows customers to pre-fund transmission upgrades, insulating shareholders from capex drag.  The initial Rule 30 announcement (13 Feb 2025) triggered a one-day \u20133.53 % move (StockTitan).  \n\u2022 Core EPS grew 10 % year-on-year in FY-23 and is guided up another ~10 % for 2025 (PG&E FY-23 release, 22 Feb 2024).  Guidance for 2026 implies a 7-9 % CAGR thereafter, underpinned by $73 bn of capital through 2030 (StockInvest transcript summary of 3Q-25 call).  \n\u2022 Analyst sentiment remains constructive: Public.com\u2019s real-time panel (10 analysts) shows 60 % Buy/Strong-Buy, 40 % Hold, 0 Sell with an average 12-month target of $20.35 versus a ~$15.50 spot price (snapshot 2 Feb 2026).  January 2026 actions include Wells Fargo (Overweight PT $23), TD Cowen (Buy $21) and Morgan Stanley (upgrade to Equal-Weight PT $20).  \n\u2022 Outer-year estimates remain sparse in the public domain.  Simply Wall St projects EPS growth of roughly 10.7 % p.a. but does not provide a numeric FY-27 consensus (Simply Wall St forecast page, accessed 4 Feb 2026).  Barchart\u2019s Zacks-powered feed also ends at FY-26.  Lack of an FY-27 street consensus is therefore a modelling blind-spot.\n\n5. Historical share-price reaction to February earnings releases  \nEvent-study data around the February cadence are patchy:  \n\u2022 FY-24 results (released 13 Feb 2025): PCG fell 1.1 % the next session (Hanenkratt Grain market note, cited in prior work).  \n\u2022 FY-23 (22 Feb 2024): no freely available one-day reaction was retrieved, although the day\u2019s press release shows FY-23 core EPS at the high-end of guidance and a guidance raise for 2024 (PG&E press release, 22 Feb 2024).  \n\u2022 FY-22 (16 Feb 2023): same data gap\u2014Google and Nasdaq pages that ordinarily house the information are currently blank or behind bot walls (prior work, 4 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 Optionslam\u2019s composite indicates a 3.91 % average absolute move across 97 historical events but does not isolate February releases.  \nNet result: traders must still rely on options-market implied moves (~4.7 %) or proprietary feeds; hard event-study numbers for 2024 and 2023 remain outstanding.\n\nKey catalysts and risk skew into 12 Feb 2026  \nUpside:  \n\u2022 CEA\u2019s 1 Apr 2026 adequacy study could accelerate cash into the SB 254 Continuation Account and pave the way for ratings upgrades;  \n\u2022 evidence undergrounding costs per mile are holding below $3.1 m, validating the rate-base growth thesis;  \n\u2022 first Rule 30 data-centre energisations (management flagged a 20 MW Equinix project for Jan 2026).  \nDownside:  \n\u2022 Resolution SPD-37 may slow the undergrounding ramp and undercut management\u2019s 7\u20139 % EPS-growth promise;  \n\u2022 the SB 254 ROE cap on the first $6 bn of mitigation capex could shave 20-40 bp from earned ROE unless offsetting CPUC relief is secured;  \n\u2022 credit-rating upgrades are unlikely until Wildfire Fund replenishment mechanics are nailed down.\n\nRemaining information gaps  \n1. Precise PCG versus XLU one-day price moves for the FY-23 (22 Feb 2024) and FY-22 (16 Feb 2023) earnings releases;  \n2. A publicly-available FY-27 EPS and revenue consensus;  \n3. Exact initial funding schedule for the SB 254 Continuation Account\u2014awaiting the CEA\u2019s 1 Apr 2026 report.\n\nClosing those holes would sharpen both near-term trading tactics and longer-dated DCF or relative-valuation models.  Nonetheless, since January 2025 PG&E has (i) locked in its next earnings date and consensus, (ii) secured legislative back-stop money via SB 254 albeit with still-unknown timing, (iii) seen the CPUC tighten undergrounding oversight, and (iv) preserved a cautiously bullish analyst stance.  The stock\u2019s February earnings-day volatility history, however, remains only partially documented.</Agent_report>\n"
