Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Summary Articles:**
1. **Jewish Independent (Burla)** - Published after Jan 26, 2026. High-quality Israeli political analysis. **Factual**: Budget must pass by March 31; failure triggers automatic dissolution; elections likely Sept 8 or May 26, 2026. **Opinion**: Author's assessment of timeline scenarios based on political sources.

2. **Times of Israel (Feb 2, 2026)** - Mainstream Israeli outlet. **Factual**: Knesset speaker excluded Supreme Court President from ceremony; opposition boycotted. **Opinion**: Lapid's accusations, Netanyahu's deflections - both identifiable political figures.

3. **Haaretz (Feb 4, 2026)** - Quality Israeli outlet. **Factual**: IDF released new Haredi draft integration order. **Opinion**: Author Amos Harel's skepticism about coalition support - identifiable expert journalist.

4. **Times of Israel Blog (Sept 1, 2025)** - Opinion piece, outdated (5 months old). **Factual**: Polling numbers from that time. **Opinion**: Editorial characterization, not expert analysis. Low weight due to age.

5. **Foreign Policy (Feb 5, 2026)** - Wait, this shows Feb 5, 2026 but today is Feb 4. This appears to be a dating error or future-dated article. **Factual**: Trump urged pardon for Netanyahu. **Opinion**: Minimal. Treat with caution due to date anomaly.

**AskNews Articles:**
6. **Multiple sources (Feb 2-4, 2026)** - Current, high reliability. **Factual**: Supreme Court ordered Netanyahu to justify keeping Ben-Gvir (hearing March 24); 53% of Israelis want Netanyahu to exit (Maariv poll, Feb 3); Netanyahu met US envoy Witkoff (Feb 4). **Opinion**: Poll results reflect public sentiment, not expert forecasts.

7. **Historical articles (Oct 2025)** - Netanyahu confirmed 2026 candidacy. **Factual**: He plans to run. **Opinion**: None relevant.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Budget deadline March 31, 2026**: Multiple independent sources (Jewish Independent, Jerusalem Post mention in outside view) confirm this structural constraint. Failure = automatic dissolution, but Netanyahu remains caretaker PM during election period. This does NOT constitute "ceasing to be PM" per typical Metaculus interpretation.
- **No imminent no-confidence vote**: No sources report active efforts to remove Netanyahu before Feb 11. The Supreme Court hearing on Ben-Gvir is March 24, well after our resolution date.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **53% want Netanyahu to exit (Maariv poll, Feb 3)**: Single reliable source, but this is public sentiment, not a concrete mechanism for removal within 7 days. Demonstrates pressure but not immediate action.
- **Coalition fragility around Haredi draft**: Multiple sources confirm this as the "most exposed political fault line," but the critical votes are weeks away (budget by March 31), not days.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Supreme Court pressure on Ben-Gvir**: Deadline for responses is Feb 24/March 10, hearing March 24. Could theoretically destabilize coalition, but timeline extends beyond our Feb 11 resolution date.
- **Trump pardon advocacy**: Speculative impact on Israeli domestic politics; no clear mechanism for affecting Netanyahu's tenure in 7 days.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 7 days (Feb 4 → Feb 11, 2026)

**Critical question**: Will the Metaculus community prediction for "Netanyahu ceases to be PM during 2026" be >30% on Feb 11?

**If timeframe halved (3.5 days)**: Probability would increase to ~88%. Less time for unexpected events; crowd predictions are stickier over very short periods (σ ≈ 2-3pp for 3-4 days).

**If timeframe doubled (14 days)**: Probability would decrease to ~70%. More time allows for: (1) budget vote outcomes becoming clearer, (2) potential coalition crisis developments, (3) Supreme Court filing deadlines (Feb 24) approaching, any of which could shift community predictions significantly.

**Key scheduled events before Feb 11**:
- Feb 5: Expected budget first-reading vote
- Feb 11: Resolution date
- No other major scheduled triggers in this window

## (d) Justification

**Starting point**: Outside view suggests current Metaculus ≈36%, with one-week σ ≈4pp, yielding 82% probability of staying >30%.

**Adjustments based on inside view**:

1. **Budget vote (Feb 5)**: This is the only major event in our 7-day window. Possible outcomes:
   - **Passes (most likely)**: Would slightly increase confidence in Netanyahu's 2026 tenure, potentially pushing Metaculus prediction from ~36% toward ~38-40%. Still comfortably >30%. 
   - **Fails**: Would trigger dissolution timeline but Netanyahu remains caretaker PM. Metaculus users historically interpret this as "has not ceased to be PM." Prediction might spike to ~45-50% (higher chance of 2026 exit via election), still >30%.
   - **Delayed**: No immediate impact; prediction stays ~36%.

2. **No resignation/removal mechanism visible**: Zero credible reporting suggests Netanyahu plans to resign or faces imminent ouster before Feb 11. Medical emergency is possible but extremely low probability (~1-2%).

3. **Metaculus crowd behavior**: Political questions on Metaculus show high inertia over 7-day windows absent major news. The 36% baseline is already pricing in known risks (coalition fragility, public dissatisfaction, legal pressures). Budget vote is anticipated, so unless outcome is dramatically unexpected, limited movement likely.

4. **Downside scenarios** (pushing prediction <30%):
   - Sudden health crisis (1% probability)
   - Completely unexpected coalition collapse with immediate successor (2% probability)
   - Metaculus crowd overreaction to positive news for Netanyahu, driving prediction down (3% probability)
   - Combined: ~6% chance of falling below 30%

**Net assessment**: The 82% outside view is well-calibrated. Inside view evidence slightly reinforces this:
- Strong structural evidence (budget timeline, no imminent removal mechanism) supports stability >30%
- Moderate evidence (public sentiment, coalition fragility) already priced into current ~36% baseline
- Weak evidence (Supreme Court, external pressures) operates on longer timescales

**Final calibration**: 82% → 83% (minor upward adjustment reflecting that budget vote, the only major event, is unlikely to crash prediction below 30% under any plausible outcome).

## Probability Calibration

The outside view of 82% is robust. Inside view analysis confirms:
- Current Metaculus baseline ≈36% (6pp above threshold)
- One-week volatility ≈4pp
- Only one scheduled event (budget vote Feb 5) in window
- All plausible budget outcomes keep prediction >30%
- Tail risk of unexpected crisis ≈6%

Calculation: P(>30%) = 0.94 × 0.88 + 0.06 × 0.15 ≈ 83%

The 83% reflects: 94% chance of no major surprise × 88% chance prediction stays >30% given normal volatility, plus 6% chance of surprise × 15% chance it still stays >30% in that scenario.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Metaculus community predict >30% chance Netanyahu exits as PM during 2026, measured Feb 11, 2026?

2. **Base rate**: Outside view 82% based on threshold-crossing questions with t≤7 days; current implied Metaculus ≈36%, σ≈4pp.

3. **Consistency**: "83 out of 100 times, the Metaculus prediction on Feb 11 will be above 30%." Yes, this aligns with a 36% baseline, 4pp volatility, and 7-day stability patterns.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Current Metaculus implied ≈36%, 6pp above threshold (strong)
   - Budget vote Feb 5 unlikely to crash prediction below 30% under any outcome (strong)
   - No credible reporting of imminent resignation/ouster (strong)
   - Historical σ≈4pp for 7-day political questions (moderate)
   - 53% public wants Netanyahu exit but no mechanism for immediate action (weak)

5. **Blind spot**: Netanyahu suffers sudden medical emergency Feb 5-10, creating genuine uncertainty about 2026 tenure. Metaculus crowd might spike prediction to 55-65%, but could also drop to 25-28% if succession appears smooth. Net effect uncertain; assign 2% probability to this scenario materially changing outcome.

6. **Status quo**: Metaculus prediction staying near 36% is the default. Seven days is short; absent major news, inertia favors stability. Slight nudge toward status quo already incorporated in 83% vs theoretical 84% from pure statistical model.

Probability: 83%
