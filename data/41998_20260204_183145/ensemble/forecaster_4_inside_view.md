Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (relevant, dated 2 Feb – 4 Feb 2026)

1. The Jewish Independent (Burla, 4 Feb 2026).  Factual reporting on the 2026-budget timetable, coalition arithmetic and realistic election dates (May, Sept).  High-quality, non-partisan.  Mostly facts; author’s interpretation (deadlock “already in campaign mode”) is labelled opinion.

2. Haaretz (Harel, 4 Feb 2026).  Factual: new IDF order to draft Haredim; coalition likely to resist.  Haaretz is reputable but left-leaning; useful for manpower shortage figures and coalition stance.  Opinion: author’s scepticism that coalition will help the army.

3. Times of Israel (Lapid–Netanyahu clash, 2 Feb 2026).  Straight news with verbatim quotes, good factual value for level of political acrimony.

4. Arabic-language press ( Maariv poll relayed by El-Watan & Lebanon24, 3 Feb 2026).  Single poll, sample 503, MoE ±4.4 pp.  Indicates 53 % of Israelis want Netanyahu to step down.  Source traceable; moderate weight.

5. Asknews items (Supreme Court order on Ben-Gvir, 4 Feb 2026).  Court instructs Netanyahu to justify keeping an ultra-right minister; hearing set 24 Mar.  Good factual, direct court document referenced.

6. Prediction-market snapshot (Manifold, late Jan 2026) – crowd probability 39–44 % that Netanyahu ceases to be PM in 2026.  Thin-liquidity but still a quantified outside anchor.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong
• Statutory rule: budget must pass 3rd reading by 31 Mar 2026 or Knesset dissolves automatically → certifies a hard hazard window inside the calendar year.
• Israeli coalitions historically fragile when budget + Haredi draft collide (2018 precedent).

Moderate
• Current crowd markets already around 40 % (independent from Metaculus).
• Recent poll: 53 % electorate favour Netanyahu’s exit; reflects sustained public pressure.
• Supreme Court expands panel re Ben-Gvir – signals judiciary willing to constrain government, adds exit pathways (legal or coalition).

Weak
• Rhetorical clashes in Knesset, Netanyahu foreign-policy speeches – little direct bearing on tenure within one year.
• Foreign Policy roundup (dated 5 Feb) – broad commentary, no new facts.

(c) Timeframe analysis

Forecast horizon: 7 days (-04 Feb → 11 Feb 2026).  Typical week-to-week volatility of Metaculus political questions ≈ ±5–7 pp absent a shock.  Halving the horizon to 3–4 days would trim my probability 1–2 pp; doubling to two weeks (post-Super-Tuesday style) would widen the window for a surprise resignation and raise probability ~3 pp.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view anchor: 40 % median crowd estimate ⇒ P(Metaculus > 30 %) ≈ 0.8 at t = now (assume normal σ ≈ 8 pp).

Inside factors this week:
+ Coalition fissures/government-collapse narrative receiving heavy press coverage keeps probabilities buoyant rather than dampened.
+ No scheduled event before 11 Feb that credibly lowers hazard rate; budget committees will still be stalled, not resolved.
+ Public opinion and Supreme Court pressures are additive, not subtractive.

– Absence of a decisive trigger in the next seven days limits upside; forecasts can drift down on “nothing happens” news fatigue (historical pattern −2 pp per quiet week).

Net adjustment: 80 % (base) – 4 pp (quiet-week drift) = 76 %.

Probability calibration

I expect that in 76 out of 100 parallel worlds the Metaculus community prediction posted at 18:35 UTC on 11 Feb 2026 exceeds 30 %.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “On 11 Feb 2026 will Metaculus probability that Netanyahu leaves office during 2026 be > 30 %?” ✓  
2. Base rate: 79 % (>30 % today, σ ≈ 8 pp). ✓  
3. Consistency: 76/100 times threshold beaten. ✓  
4. Key evidence (20 wds each):  
   – Budget must pass by 31 Mar or automatic elections.  
   – Manifold market shows 39–44 % exit probability.  
   – Recent poll 53 % want Netanyahu gone.  
   – Supreme Court pressures coalition via Ben-Gvir case.  
5. Blind-spot: Surprise Gaza cease-fire success + budget deal announced 9 Feb dropping exit odds below 25 %.  
6. Status-quo: Absent shocks, forecasts drift slightly downward, hence small haircut from 79 to 76. ✓

Probability: 76%
