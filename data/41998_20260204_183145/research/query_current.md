Analysis:
The Metaculus community prediction for Netanyahu leaving office in 2026 has been sitting exactly at 30 %. Whether it drifts upward over the next seven days will hinge on any fresh information that either (a) increases perceived political-survival risk (e.g., coalition fractures, legal rulings that accelerate his trial, intensified ICC pressure, major security or economic shocks, new opinion-poll trends favouring the opposition, or rumours of advancing the election date), or (b) does the opposite.  
Therefore the most relevant current coverage will be:  
• Reports of coalition tensions inside Likud or with ultra-Orthodox and far-right partners (budget fights, draft bill standoffs, threats by ministers to walk out).  
• Courtroom developments—judges’ rulings on evidentiary motions or a plea-bargain leak that could shorten the trial.  
• Diplomatic and legal moves: ICC or foreign-state arrest-warrant steps, US/EU travel restrictions, or UN votes that might constrain Netanyahu.  
• Polling snapshots since late January 2026, especially any showing the opposition bloc maintaining or widening its lead.  
• Speculation about bringing elections forward from autumn 2026 to spring/summer, or about potential Likud leadership challenges.  
A spike in any of these news streams between now and 11 Feb would likely nudge the crowd above 30 %, whereas a quiet news week probably keeps it at or below the current mark.
