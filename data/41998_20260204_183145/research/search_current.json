The court has not yet received a direct response from Netanyahu, who is responsible for ministerial appointments, regarding the rationale for keeping Ben-Gvir\u2014leader of a far-right political faction\u2014despite serious accusations. The case stems from Ben-Gvir\u2019s violation of prior agreements with the state attorney, which restrict political interference in police operations, including protest management, promotion policies, and security decision-making. Due to the political sensitivity of the case, the court expanded the panel reviewing the petition for Ben-Gvir\u2019s removal to nine judges, with the decisive hearing scheduled for March 24, 2026.

He warned that further challenges lie ahead and that those attempting to harm Tel Aviv will face severe repercussions. Netanyahu also criticized Knesset members for overstepping their authority and encroaching on other branches of government, asserting, 'The essence of the Knesset's work is enacting laws\u2014this is our goal\u2014but our success diminishes when powers exceed their limits. We must ensure no authority oversteps another.'\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:01 PM\nSource:[\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a.\u0643\u0648\u0645](https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_publicaffairs/details/2026/2/2/2936206/%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%85-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%88%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%87-%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%AC-%D9%84%D9%86-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%84%D9%87%D8%A7-)\n\n**Netanyahu says anyone who attacks Israel will face 'unbearable consequences'**\nIn a speech to the Knesset on February 2, 2026, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu declared that Israel is 'ready for every scenario' amid rising tensions over a potential U.S. attack on Iran following Iran's violent crackdown on anti-regime protesters.

The announcement underscores his intent to remain politically active despite ongoing war, internal pressures, and a decline in personal popularity. Although the election is still a year away, Israel's political landscape remains volatile. Netanyahu's current government relies on a fragile coalition including ultra-Orthodox parties, which could withdraw if the current ceasefire with Hamas fails, potentially triggering early elections. While Netanyahu's Likud party has shown resilience in recent polls\u2014projected to retain between 30 and 34 of the 120 Knesset seats\u2014its coalition allies are showing signs of weakening, complicating the formation of a new government. With over 30 years of political activity and ongoing judicial proceedings against him, Netanyahu may be motivated to stay in power. Meanwhile, the opposition is working to consolidate and form a competitive coalition for the 2026 election.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 12:39 PM\nSource:[Jovem Pan \u2013 Esportes, entretenimento, not\u00edcias e v\u00eddeos com credibilidade](https://jovempan.com.br/programas/jornal-da-manha/netanyahu-confirma-candidatura-para-as-eleicoes-de-2026-em-israel.html)\n\n**Netanyahu Announces Candidacy for Prime Ministership in Upcoming 2026 Elections**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Saturday evening that he will run again for prime minister in the upcoming 2026 elections. Responding to a question on Israel's Channel 14, Netanyahu confirmed his candidacy. He is the leader of Likud, Israel's largest right-wing party, and has served the longest cumulative time as prime minister in Israeli history\u2014over 18 years across separate terms since 1996. In the most recent elections, his party won 32 seats in the Knesset, with its ultra-Orthodox allies securing 18 seats and the Religious Zionist alliance winning 14 seats, marking a record high for the far-right bloc. Netanyahu faces three corruption cases since May 2020. During his current term, which began in late 2022, he proposed sweeping judicial reforms, which critics argue aim to weaken the judiciary. These reforms sparked massive protests that only subsided after the outbreak of the Gaza war, which began following Hamas's attack on Israel on October 7, 2023. He has also faced domestic criticism over his management of the war and the handling of hostage releases from Gaza. Additionally, he is facing an international arrest warrant from the International Criminal Court over allegations of issuing orders that may constitute war crimes and crimes against humanity in Gaza.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 10:53 AM\nSource:[\u0645\u0648\u0642\u0639 \u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631\u0643 \u0644\u0644\u0623\u062e\u0628\u0627\u0631 \u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0631\u064a\u0629](http://akhbarak.net/news/details/48047615/0/%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7%D9%87%D9%88-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%B4%D8%AD%D9%87-%D9%84%D8%B1%D8%A6%D8%A7%D8%B3%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%A9)\n\n**Netanyahu Announces Repeated Candidacy for Prime Ministership in Israel's 2026 Elections**\nIsraeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu announced on Saturday, October 18, 2025, during an interview with Israeli Channel 14, that he will run again for prime minister in the 2026 parliamentary elections.
