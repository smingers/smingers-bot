As of February 3, 2026, they sat separately in parliament for the first time on a regular sitting day.\n\n2. **Polling Data (Australian Financial Review, released Monday before Feb 3, 2026):**\n   - Combined Liberal and National primary vote: **19%** (lowest level ever recorded)\n   - This represents a **13 percentage point drop** from the May 2025 federal election\n   - One Nation party: **26%** (highest ever polling, now exceeding the old Coalition parties)\n   - Labor Party: **34%** (stagnant from December levels and the May 2025 election result)\n\n3. **Historical Context:** The Liberals received their lowest vote in the May 2025 election since the party was founded in 1944. Labor won with its second-lowest ever winning total.\n\n4. **Parliamentary Seats:** After the last election, the Liberals retained only 9 of 88 metropolitan seats.\n\n## Analysis and Commentary:\n\n- The AFR editorial characterized this as a \"structural realignment\" challenging Australia's two-party system, drawing parallels to Trump's America First movement and Nigel Farage's Reform Party in Britain.\n\n- The AFR attributed the shift to \"anti-establishment sentiment, lack of confidence in the political system,\" perception that major parties are indistinguishable, and the fact that \"living standards have now gone backwards\" for the majority.\n\n- The article draws parallels to the UK situation where Reform has effectively supplanted the Conservatives as the main opposition.\n\n## Political Developments:\n\n- The Coalition split was triggered by three National shadow cabinet MPs crossing the floor to vote against Labor's new \"hate speech\" laws (introduced after the Bondi terrorist attack).\n\n- Recent defections: Former Nationals leader Barnaby Joyce and former Liberal MP Corey Bernardi both joined One Nation in recent months.\n\n- Leadership instability: Nationals leader David Littleproud faced a leadership challenge; Liberal leader Sussan Ley is described as a \"lame duck\" with right-wing Liberals Angus Taylor and Andrew Hastie positioning for a challenge.\n\n**Note:** This article is from World Socialist Web Site, which has a particular ideological perspective that shapes its analysis and framing of events.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.jpost.com/israel-news/politics-and-diplomacy/article-884565\">\n# Summary of Article: Israel Delays 2026 Budget Vote Amid Haredi Draft Dispute\n\n**Key Facts and Timeline:**\n\n- **Budget Vote Postponed:** Israel's government postponed the scheduled first reading vote of the 2026 state budget on Monday, January 26, 2026, rescheduling it for Wednesday.\n\n- **Critical Deadline:** If the state budget is not approved in all three readings by the end of March 2026 (when the fiscal year closes), the Knesset will automatically dissolve and elections will be called.\n\n- **Legal Timing Constraint:** Israeli law requires at least 60 days between the first reading approval and the second/third readings, meaning the first reading must pass this week to meet the March deadline.\n\n- **Coalition Status:** Netanyahu has been without a stable coalition majority since July 2025, following the collapse of negotiations over haredi conscription legislation, which led haredi parties to exit the government.\n\n**Core Dispute:**\n\nThe postponement stems from disagreements between the government and haredi parties (Shas and United Torah Judaism) over the haredi conscription bill. The haredi parties are threatening to withhold support for the state budget unless agreements are reached on draft legislation that would allow them to avoid conscription.\n\n**Key Political Positions:**\n\n- **Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich:** Threatened Netanyahu that if the budget wasn't voted on Monday as planned, the Knesset should be dissolved. He demands the haredi parties \"completely separate the issue of conscription from the budget\" and stated \"A state budget cannot be used as leverage by anyone, ever, and certainly not during wartime.\"\n\n- **Opposition Leader Yair Lapid:** Claims the haredi parties realized their draft-evasion law will not pass. He plans to bring a bill to dissolve the Knesset to a vote on Wednesday. By law, six months must pass before such a bill can be brought to vote again\u2014this period has now elapsed since the last coalition crisis in June.\n\n- **United Torah Judaism (UTJ) Source:** Confirmed to The Jerusalem Post that \"there are disagreements on a number of sections of the bill.\"\n\n**Additional Context:**\n\n- Critics argue the current draft bill fails to enforce haredi conscription and serves primarily as a political measure to appease haredi parties.\n\n- The IDF has stated it urgently needs more manpower after over two years of war.\n\n- The Knesset's Foreign Affairs and Defense Committee's legal adviser has criticized certain sections of the haredi draft bill that are expected to require changes.\n\n- Previous agreements reported on Sunday appeared to fall through by Monday.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cfr.org/global-conflict-tracker/conflict/war-yemen\">\n## Summary of Article: \"Conflict in Yemen and the Red Sea\"\n\n**Key Facts and Context:**\n\n- **Current Situation**: Fighting between Houthi rebels and the Saudi coalition has largely subsided, but Houthis have repeatedly attacked ships in the Red Sea in response to Israel's war on Hamas.\n\n- **Humanitarian Crisis**: \n  - 21.6 million people need aid (including 11 million children)\n  - More than 4.5 million people are displaced\n  - 60% of estimated 377,000 deaths between 2015-early 2022 were from indirect causes (food insecurity, lack of health services)\n  - 5 million at risk of famine\n  - Cholera outbreak has affected over one million people\n\n**Historical Background:**\n\n- Civil war began in 2014 when Houthi insurgents took control of Sanaa\n- Saudi-led coalition began military campaign in March 2015 with U.S. logistical and intelligence support\n- Coalition has carried out over 25,000 air strikes causing over 19,000 civilian casualties\n- From 2021-2022, Houthis responded with drone attacks on Saudi Arabia and UAE\n\n**Political Developments:**\n\n- April 2022: President Abd Rabbu Mansour Hadi resigned after 10 years, replaced by a seven-member presidential council led by Rashad al-Alimi\n- Southern Transitional Council (STC) has renewed calls for an independent southern Yemeni state, complicating peace prospects\n- Dialogue between Houthis and Saudi Arabia, along with Iranian-Saudi normalization, has provided hope but talks have yielded little progress\n\n**U.S. Involvement:**\n\n- President Biden announced end to U.S. support for Saudi-led offensive operations in February 2021\n- Revoked Houthis' terrorist organization designation in 2021\n- January 2024: Houthis redesignated as terrorist organization due to attacks on ships in Red Sea and Gulf of Aden\n- U.S. has conducted nearly 400 strikes in Yemen since 2002 targeting AQAP and Islamic State militants\n\n**Note**: The article text appears to be cut off at the end regarding the presidential council transition.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve full daily history of community prediction for Metaculus question 40966 since launch; list any significant Israeli political/legal events between 2026-01-15 and 2026-02-04 that could influence forecasts.\nMetaculus daily-history data (question #40966)  \n\u2022 The searches returned no CSV, JSON, or screenshot containing the day-by-day community prediction for Metaculus question 40966.  \n\u2022 Metaculus normally makes a complete time series available through its public, undocumented but widely-used API.  The pattern is:\n\n\u2003https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/<ID>/  \n\u2003https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/<ID>/timeline/\n\nThe second endpoint returns a JSON array in which each object contains, inter alia, \u201ct\u201d (POSIX time stamp) and \u201ccommunity_prediction\u201d.  Polling that endpoint once yields the entire historical series since launch; no rate-limit is imposed for a single call.  Because the present search results do not include that JSON, the full daily history still has to be downloaded directly or via a script that hits the /timeline/ endpoint and resamples at 24-hour intervals.  Consequently, additional information is required to satisfy the first half of the original query.\n\nMajor Israeli political/legal events that occurred from 15 Jan 2026 through 4 Feb 2026 and could influence forecasts for question 40966  \n\n(Dates are those of the reports.)\n\n1. 15 Jan 2026 \u2013 Al Jazeera investigation describes a coordinated influence-operation by Israeli-linked networks to steer international perception of Iranian protests, including direct online involvement by Israeli officials (Al Jazeera, 15 Jan 2026).  The finding underscores Israel\u2019s continuing use of digital information operations, relevant to questions involving Israel-Iran relations or regional information warfare.\n\n2. 2 Feb 2026 \u2013 Israel\u2019s Ministry for Diaspora Affairs withdrew licences from M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res (MSF) and 36 other NGOs for refusing to hand over staff information, and threatened criminalisation of any group that fails to register (Al Jazeera, 2 Feb 2026).  Ten large NGOs said they will defy the order, portraying the move as an attempt to \u201cobstruct humanitarian assistance\u201d in Gaza.  This raises legal-political risk around humanitarian access and may affect forecasts concerning Gaza\u2019s humanitarian or political trajectory.\n\n3. 3 Feb 2026 \u2013 Israel\u2019s Supreme Court Chief Justice Isaac Amit recused himself from selecting the panel that will decide whether to compel a full state commission of inquiry into the government\u2019s failures around the 7 Oct 2024 Hamas attack (Jerusalem Post, 3 Feb 2026).  Justice Noam Sohlberg will now choose the expanded bench.  The petitions, if granted, could lead to a far-reaching, independent investigation of Prime Minister Netanyahu\u2019s cabinet and the security services, potentially influencing domestic political stability and accountability forecasts.\n\n4. 4 Feb 2026 \u2013 Guardian reports that six Palestine Action activists were acquitted of aggravated burglary and violent-disorder charges tied to a 2024 break-in at Elbit Systems\u2019 Filton factory in the UK (Guardian, 4 Feb 2026).  Although a UK case, the verdict is seen as a political setback for Israel\u2019s attempts to frame anti-Elbit actions as violent extremism, which could have knock-on effects on international legal challenges to Israeli arms suppliers.\n\n5. 4 Feb 2026 \u2013 Lebanon\u2019s President Joseph Aoun accused Israel of an \u201cenvironmental and health crime\u201d after the IDF sprayed chemicals over southern Lebanon; UNIFIL suspended operations for nine hours and is testing samples (Al Jazeera, 4 Feb 2026).  The incident adds legal exposure under international environmental law and heightens regional tensions along the northern border.\n\n6. 4 Feb 2026 \u2013 Israeli authorities issued new partial eviction orders against Palestinian families in the Baten al-Hawa quarter of Silwan, East Jerusalem, after the High Court rejected residents\u2019 appeal (IMEMC, 4 Feb 2026).  The move is part of an intensified push by the settler organisation Ateret Cohanim and places about 700 Palestinians at risk of displacement, feeding legal controversies over property rights and settlement policies.\n\n7. 2 Feb 2026 \u2013 Critical Threats/AEI notes that Iran is working diplomatically to deter a possible US or Israeli strike and warns that any attack on Iran could trigger a regional escalation; Israel remains a potential actor in such a strike (Critical Threats, 2 Feb 2026).  The analysis highlights the strategic backdrop against which Israeli decision-makers operate.\n\n8. 3 Feb 2026 \u2013 A Forward report reveals AIPAC\u2019s covert $2.2 million spending in a New Jersey Democratic primary to unseat a candidate supportive of conditional aid to Israel (Forward, 3 Feb 2026).  While a US domestic story, it shows the scale of pro-Israel lobbying at a moment when international scrutiny of Israeli actions is high.\n\nCollectively, these items cover judicial independence, government accountability, treatment of NGOs and humanitarian law, settlement expansion, regional military friction (Lebanon, Iran), and external political influence.  Each could alter analysts\u2019 expectations regarding Israel\u2019s domestic political stability, foreign-policy posture, or exposure to legal constraints\u2014dimensions likely germane to Metaculus question 40966 (whose exact wording was not supplied in the prompt but evidently concerns Israeli politics/legal issues).\n\nInformation gaps  \n\u2022 Daily community-prediction time series for Metaculus 40966 remains missing; it should be fetched via the Metaculus /timeline/ API or comparable third-party archival tools.  \n\u2022 Some potentially relevant Israeli events (e.g., Knesset legislation, cabinet decisions, polling shifts) may not have surfaced in the limited search set.  Targeted queries to Israeli media (Haaretz, Times of Israel, Globes) or the Knesset press release archive might yield additional items.\n\nRecommended additional searches (different from previous ones)  \n1. metaculus 40966 timeline json (Google)  \n2. site:haaretz.com January 2026 Netanyahu inquiry (Google)  \n3. israel supreme court commission inquiry jan 2026 (Google News)\n\nIf the Metaculus endpoint returns data successfully, the daily figures can be transformed into a CSV or plotted directly for the user.  Absent that retrieval, the answer regarding historical prediction data cannot yet be completed.</Agent_report>\n"
