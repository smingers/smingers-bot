## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Declining recession probability trend**: Multiple independent sources (CNBC survey: 53%→30%→23%; Goldman Sachs: 30%→20% from outside view) show consistent downward revision of recession risk throughout late 2025 and early 2026
2. **Strong Q3 2025 performance**: 4.3% GDP growth significantly exceeded expectations, creating positive momentum
3. **Professional consensus optimism**: CNBC survey, Morgan Stanley, Conference Board all project positive 2026 growth (1.8-2.4% range)

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Mixed Q1 2026 signals**: Morgan Stanley warns of slowdown in first two quarters; Conference Board expects slower growth through early 2026 due to tariffs
2. **Administration optimism**: Trump officials predict 5%+ growth, but experts (Skordeles) express skepticism about sustainability
3. **Labor market softening**: December jobs report weak (50,000 vs 73,000 expected) but unemployment stable at 4.4%

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Short-term volatility**: 10-day prediction window means minimal new hard data will emerge
2. **Policy uncertainty**: Tariffs, immigration restrictions create uncertainty but effects unclear in timeframe

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 10 days (Feb 4 to Feb 14, 2026)

This is an extremely short window. Key considerations:
- We're currently in early February 2026, meaning Q1 2026 is partially complete
- No definitive Q1 GDP data will be available (first estimate typically late April, third estimate late June)
- Limited economic releases expected in 10 days (possibly weekly jobless claims, some manufacturing indices)

**If timeframe halved (5 days)**: Prediction would shift toward status quo (staying at 27%) - too little time for meaningful information to emerge or community to update. Would lower probability to ~25%.

**If timeframe doubled (20 days)**: More economic data would arrive (January jobs report, retail sales, potentially Fed meeting minutes), increasing chance of meaningful updates. Would raise probability to ~45%.

## (d) Justification

**Current Position**: Community prediction at 27.00% aligns with middle-to-lower end of expert recession probability estimates (23-35% range).

**Critical Insight**: The question asks if prediction will be HIGHER than 27.00% - meaning even 27.01% resolves Yes. This creates asymmetry favoring Yes outcomes.

**Directional Forces:**

*Downward Pressure (suggests prediction stays ≤27%):*
- Strong trend of declining recession probability (CNBC survey: 53%→23% over 8 months)
- Recent Q3 2025 GDP significantly beat expectations (4.3% vs ~3.2% consensus)
- Professional forecasts consistently project positive 2026 growth
- Multiple experts expressing optimism about productivity and AI-driven growth
- Short timeframe limits likelihood of major negative surprises

*Upward Pressure (suggests prediction rises >27%):*
- Morgan Stanley explicitly mentions downside scenario with negative Q-on-Q growth in H1 2026
- Conference Board warns of slower growth through early 2026 due to tariffs
- December jobs report disappointed (50K vs 73K expected)
- Very low threshold (27.01% triggers Yes)
- Continuous micro-updates on Metaculus could nudge slightly higher
- Policy uncertainty (tariffs, immigration) creates tail risks

**Key Tension**: The strong downward trend in expert recession probabilities suggests the next major move should be downward, but the extremely low threshold means even minor negative news or natural volatility could trigger >27%.

**Calibration Against Outside View**: My outside view was 35%, based on the low threshold and continuous updates. However, the inside view evidence shows:
- Much stronger recent momentum toward declining recession risk than I initially weighted
- We're now IN February 2026 with Q1 partially complete, reducing uncertainty
- Professional consensus has converged around 2%+ growth for 2026
- The most recent comprehensive survey (CNBC, Jan 27) shows 23% recession probability, below current 27%

This suggests the community prediction is actually slightly HIGH relative to current expert consensus, creating downward rather than upward pressure.

Probability Calibration:

Starting from outside view of 35%, adjusting based on inside evidence:

**Major adjustments:**
- Recent expert consensus (23% recession probability in CNBC survey) is BELOW current 27% community prediction: -10 percentage points
- Strong Q3 2025 beat and consistent downward revision trend: -5 percentage points
- We're now in Feb 2026 with Q1 partially complete, reducing uncertainty about early 2026: -5 percentage points

**Minor adjustments:**
- Extremely low threshold (27.01% triggers Yes) favors random upward drift: +5 percentage points
- Morgan Stanley downside scenario explicitly mentions H1 2026 negative growth: +5 percentage points
- Short timeframe limits new information: -5 percentage points

Calculation: 35% - 10% - 5% - 5% + 5% + 5% - 5% = 20%

**Cross-check**: Am I saying there's only a 20% chance the prediction rises above 27.00% in 10 days? Given that:
- Current expert consensus (23%) is below 27%
- Strong recent trend toward declining recession risk
- Limited new data in 10 days
- But extremely low threshold

This seems slightly too low given the threshold asymmetry. Adjusting upward to 25%.

**Final calibration**: The evidence strongly suggests downward pressure on recession probability, but the 10-day window and low threshold create meaningful uncertainty. 25% represents: "More likely than not the prediction stays at or drops below 27%, but meaningful chance of minor upward drift or negative news pushing slightly above."

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Metaculus community prediction for "US negative GDP growth Q1-Q3 2026" exceed 27.00% on Feb 14, 2026? (10 days from now)

2. **Base rate check**: Outside view was 35% based on low threshold and continuous updates. Inside view shows stronger downward pressure (expert consensus at 23%, strong Q3 beat, declining recession probability trend), justifying downward revision to 25%.

3. **Consistency check**: "25 out of 100 times, the community prediction rises above 27.00% in the next 10 days." This aligns with: strong recent downward trend in recession risk, but acknowledges low threshold and short-term volatility.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - CNBC survey (Jan 27): 23% recession probability, down from 53% in May - below current 27%
   - Q3 2025 GDP: 4.3% vs 3.2% expected - strong positive momentum
   - Morgan Stanley downside scenario: explicitly mentions H1 2026 negative growth possibility
   - December jobs: 50K vs 73K expected - minor negative signal
   - Threshold: 27.01% triggers Yes - creates asymmetric upward bias

5. **Blind spot**: Unexpected negative economic data release in next 10 days (e.g., terrible January jobs report, sharp manufacturing contraction, major corporate layoff announcements) could quickly push community prediction above 27%. This would make forecast look too confident in status quo.

6. **Status quo**: Current 27% has been stable since Feb 1. In 10-day window with limited data, status quo (staying at 27%) is most likely outcome. My 25% for ">27%" implies 75% for "≤27%", which appropriately weights status quo given short timeframe.

Probability: 25%
