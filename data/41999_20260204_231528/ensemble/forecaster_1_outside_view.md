## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Expert recession probability forecasts for 2026**
   - RSM: 30% (next 12 months from their forecast date)
   - J.P. Morgan: 35% (for 2026)
   - Goldman Sachs: 20% (next 12 months)
   - Average: ~28%
   - **Suitability**: High - these are professional forecasts for the exact timeframe

2. **Historical Metaculus community prediction stability over 13-day periods**
   - Cannot access this data due to question inaccessibility
   - **Suitability**: Would be ideal but unavailable

3. **GDP growth forecasts implying negative growth probability**
   - RSM Adverse scenario (30% probability): <1% growth
   - Deloitte downside scenario: -0.2% in 2027 (not 2026)
   - Goldman Sachs: 2.5% growth (very optimistic)
   - **Suitability**: Medium - these provide bounds but don't directly translate to Q1-Q3 2026 negative growth

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: Expert recession probability forecasts (28-35% range), adjusted for the specific question of Q1-Q3 2026 negative GDP growth versus full-year recession.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 10 days (from Feb 4 to Feb 14, 2026)

**Critical Factors:**
- Current community prediction: 27.00% (as of Feb 1, 2026)
- Question asks if it will be HIGHER than 27.00% on Feb 14
- We're in early February 2026, with Q1 2026 currently underway
- Third estimate for Q1 won't be available until months later (typically late June for Q1)

**Information Environment Over Next 10 Days:**
- Unlikely to get definitive Q1 GDP data
- Possible: January economic indicators (jobs report, retail sales, manufacturing data)
- Possible: Fed commentary or policy signals
- Possible: Tariff announcements or trade policy changes
- Most economic releases are monthly and backward-looking

**Historical Pattern Considerations:**
- Community predictions on Metaculus tend to be sticky in short timeframes absent major news
- A move from 27% to >27% requires only marginal upward revision
- Expert forecasts range 20-35%, suggesting 27% is in the middle of professional opinion
- Recent sources (Goldman Sachs) show declining recession probability (30%→20%), suggesting downward pressure

## (d) Justification

The question asks whether the Metaculus community prediction will rise above 27.00% by February 14, 2026 - just 10 days away.

**Key Considerations:**

1. **Current Position**: At 27.00%, the community is aligned with the middle of expert recession probability estimates (RSM 30%, JP Morgan 35%, Goldman Sachs 20%)

2. **Information Flow**: Over the next 10 days, we're unlikely to receive definitive data about Q1-Q3 2026 GDP. Any movement would be driven by:
   - Early economic indicators (jobs, retail, manufacturing)
   - Policy announcements (tariffs, fiscal policy)
   - Expert forecast updates
   - General sentiment shifts

3. **Directional Bias**: Recent expert revisions trend toward LOWER recession probability:
   - Goldman Sachs reduced from 30% to 20%
   - RSM reduced from 40% to 30%
   - Most forecasts emphasize resilience and above-trend growth

4. **Magnitude Required**: The question requires the prediction to move from 27.00% to >27.00% - even 27.01% would resolve Yes. This is an extremely small threshold.

5. **Metaculus Dynamics**: Community predictions incorporate new information continuously. Even minor positive economic data or bullish expert commentary could nudge the prediction marginally higher.

6. **Status Quo Bias**: However, absent significant news, predictions tend to be sticky. The 10-day window is short for major revisions.

**Competing Forces:**
- **Upward pressure**: Very low threshold (>27.00%), continuous information incorporation, recent expert optimism
- **Downward pressure**: Short timeframe, lack of definitive data releases, recent expert revisions trending downward suggest next movement more likely down than up

The critical insight is that while expert consensus suggests recession probability might decline further (supporting downward movement), the threshold is so low that even minor fluctuations or a single piece of moderately concerning economic data could push above 27.00%.

Outside view calibration:

The reference class of expert recession probabilities (20-35%) centers around 27-28%, precisely where the community prediction sits. This suggests the community is well-calibrated to expert opinion.

The question's resolution threshold is asymmetric: it asks if the prediction will be HIGHER than 27.00%, meaning 27.01% resolves Yes. This creates a slight bias toward Yes outcomes from random walk behavior.

However, the recent trend in expert forecasts is clearly downward (Goldman Sachs 30%→20%, RSM 40%→30%), suggesting the next major revision is more likely to be downward than upward. Over 10 days, the probability of receiving information that moves the needle significantly is moderate.

Key calibration factors:
- Random walk over 10 days with low threshold: ~50% baseline
- Recent expert trend downward: -10 to -15 percentage points
- Sticky predictions in short timeframes: -5 percentage points
- Continuous minor updates possible: +5 percentage points
- Information asymmetry (bad news moves predictions more than good news): -5 percentage points

Rough calculation: 50% - 15% - 5% + 5% - 5% = 30%

Cross-checking: If I believed there was a 30% chance the prediction rises above 27.00%, I'm saying there's a 70% chance it stays at or below 27.00%. Given the downward trend in expert forecasts and short timeframe, this seems reasonable but perhaps slightly conservative given the very low threshold.

Adjusting upward slightly to account for the extremely low threshold and continuous micro-updates: 35%

Outside View Prediction:
35%
