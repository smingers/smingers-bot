- Q3 2025 GDP growth was 4.3% (strong historical data)
- Multiple international sources showing varied global outlooks
- Quality: Mixed - some factual data, some speculative

(b) Evidence Analysis:

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Recent Q3 2025 GDP performance (4.3%)** - Multiple sources confirm this historical fact, showing economy entered 2026 with strong momentum
2. **Institutional recession probabilities clustering 20-35%** - JPM (35%), CNBC survey (23%), Goldman (20%) all bracket the current 27% Metaculus prediction
3. **Conference Board warning of "slower growth through late 2025 and early 2026"** - Authoritative source with specific timeframe matching Q1-Q2 2026

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Weak December 2025 jobs data (50,000)** - Single data point but from official source; suggests slowing momentum
2. **Morgan Stanley's downside scenario** - Explicitly mentions "negative quarter-on-quarter growth in first half of 2026" as possibility
3. **Policy uncertainty effects** - Multiple experts cite Trump tariffs, immigration restrictions as growth headwinds

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Trump administration's 5-6% growth predictions** - Political statements contradicted by professional forecasters
2. **Apollo Academy's optimism** - Lacks specific supporting data

(c) Timeframe Analysis:

**Prediction Window: 10 days (Feb 4 → Feb 14, 2026)**

Key upcoming data releases:
- Feb 8: Weekly jobless claims
- Feb 9: University of Michigan consumer sentiment
- Feb 13: January 2026 CPI (most important)

If timeframe halved (5 days): Would increase probability to ~52% - less time for news to move the community prediction, more likely to stay near 27%

If timeframe doubled (20 days): Would increase probability to ~58% - more data releases and time for fundamental views to shift the community prediction

The razor-thin threshold (27.00% vs 27.01%) makes this highly sensitive to even minimal movement.

(d) Justification:

**Factors supporting upward movement (>27%):**
1. Conference Board's explicit warning about "slower growth through late 2025 and early 2026" directly addresses Q1-Q2 2026 timeframe
2. Weak December jobs data (50,000) released recently could shift sentiment negatively
3. JPM and CNBC survey recession probabilities (35%, 23%) are actually higher than current 27%, suggesting potential upward drift
4. Morgan Stanley's downside scenario explicitly mentions negative Q1-Q2 2026 growth
5. Meta-gaming effect: Users aware of this meta-question may intentionally push the prediction slightly higher

**Factors supporting downward movement (<27%):**
1. Strong Q3 2025 GDP (4.3%) provides momentum narrative
2. Goldman Sachs' influential 20% recession probability is below 27%
3. Trump administration optimism (though politically motivated) could influence some forecasters
4. CNBC survey shows recession risk declining from 30% to 23%

**Net Assessment:**
The evidence is roughly balanced but slightly tilted upward. The Conference Board warning specifically about early 2026 slowdown is highly relevant. The weak jobs data is fresh information. Most importantly, the threshold is exactly at the current value - any upward tick resolves YES.

Probability Calibration:

Starting from outside view base rate: 55%

Adjustments:
- +3pp: Conference Board's specific early-2026 slowdown warning is highly relevant and recent
- +2pp: Weak December jobs data released after the current 27% was established
- +2pp: JPM/CNBC institutional estimates averaging slightly above 27%
- -2pp: Strong Q3 momentum narrative and declining recession probabilities
- +2pp: Razor-thin threshold amplifies meta-gaming incentives

Calibrated prediction: 55% + 7% = 62%

Verification: "62 out of 100 times, the community prediction exceeds 27.00% on Feb 14" - This feels appropriate given the balanced but slightly negative-leaning recent evidence and the exact threshold.

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Metaculus community prediction for "US negative GDP Q1-Q3 2026" exceed 27.00% on Feb 14, 2026? (10-day window)

2. **Base rate check**: Outside view established 55% based on historical 10-day movements (~50% symmetric + meta-gaming tilt). Current prediction 62% represents moderate upward adjustment based on specific evidence.

3. **Consistency**: "62 out of 100 times, the community prediction will be higher than 27.00% on Feb 14." This aligns with slight negative tilt in recent evidence plus razor-thin threshold.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Conference Board warns of slower growth "through late 2025 and early 2026" (strong, recent)
   - December jobs growth only 50,000, well below expectations (moderate, fresh)
   - Institutional recession estimates (JPM 35%, CNBC 23%) bracket current 27% (strong)
   - Q3 2025 GDP was strong 4.3%, providing momentum (moderate, historical)
   - Exact threshold (27.00%) amplifies meta-gaming effects (moderate)

5. **Blind spot**: If January CPI (Feb 13) comes in surprisingly low, it could trigger optimism about soft landing and push the recession probability down 1-2pp before Feb 14, making my forecast look too high.

6. **Status quo**: Current value is exactly 27.00%. Given 10-day window and balanced evidence, status quo suggests ~50-55% chance of any movement. My 62% represents modest upward bias justified by recent negative data and specific Q1-Q2 2026 warnings.

Probability: 62%
