Analysis:
### 1) Paraphrase / alignment with resolution criteria
This resolves **Yes** iff the Metaculus community prediction (CP) for Q41089 is **strictly greater than 27.00%** at **2026-02-14 03:03:32**; otherwise **No** (including exactly 27.00%).

### (a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; fact vs opinion)
**Morgan Stanley (2026 outlook; dated, identifiable institution; high quality):**  
- *Opinion/model output:* U.S. real GDP growth ~**1.8% in 2026**, slowing early then reaccelerating; includes a **downside mild recession** scenario in H1 2026.  
- Relevance: supports “some downside risk exists,” but baseline is non-recessionary.

**CBS News (Jan 22, 2026; mixed quality—quotes + some context):**  
- *Facts:* reports administration claims (Lutnick), mentions GDPNow and recent GDP.  
- *Opinions:* administration forecasts (very rosy) and economists pushing back (e.g., Truist ~2.3% 2026).  
- Relevance: net tone is “headline optimism, but experts temper it,” likely *downward* pressure on negative-growth odds.

**Conference Board (Jan 30, 2026; reputable; high quality):**  
- *Opinion:* slower growth late 2025/early 2026 due to tariffs; “sizable risks” both ways; notes data gaps from shutdown.  
- Relevance: raises uncertainty; could keep CP from falling much, but not a strong “recession is coming” signal.

**Apollo/Torsten Slok (Jan 17, 2026; identifiable expert but thin excerpt; medium quality):**  
- *Opinion:* recession probability declining; growth forecasts revised up.  
- Relevance: mild downward pressure on CP.

**CNBC Fed Survey (Jan 27, 2026; survey-based; medium-high quality):**  
- *Facts:* survey aggregates: **2026 GDP ~2.4%**, **recession probability ~23%**, only two cuts expected.  
- Relevance: a fairly direct “expert-consensus” nudge *below* 27%, and importantly it is *recent*.

**NPR (Jan 6, 2026; solid synthesis; medium-high quality):**  
- *Facts/opinions attributed:* JP Morgan recession probability **~35%**; Blue Chip forecasters disagree widely but most expect no recession.  
- Relevance: supports “tail risk still meaningful,” but not clearly pushing above 27 in the next 10 days.

**AskNews/TalkMarkets (Feb 2 & Jan 16; lower institutional weight; medium/low):**  
- *Opinion commentary:* slower population growth/immigration reduces trend growth but not necessarily recession; “growth will defy slowdown fears.”  
- Relevance: mostly incremental; slight downward pressure.

**Other AskNews items (immigration/population decline; Feb 4; foreign press; medium):**  
- *Facts/analysis:* immigration down; possible small GDP drag.  
- Relevance: could push CP up a bit at the margin (less labor supply; demand shifts), but effects are longer-horizon and unlikely to move Metaculus materially in 10 days.

### (b) Evidence analysis (weighted toward what moves the CP by Feb 14)
Key point: we are forecasting **movement of a crowd median over ~10 days**, not the underlying GDP outcome. That makes “near-term catalysts + platform inertia” unusually important.

**Strong evidence (large-ish directional pull)**
1) **Status quo + strict threshold**: if CP stays at **27.00%** (or drifts down), outcome is **No**. Metaculus CPs can be sticky absent catalysts.  
   - Direction: toward **No**.

**Moderate evidence (moderate pull)**
2) **Recent expert-survey recession risk around low/mid-20s (CNBC survey: 23%)** plus multiple bank/forecaster baselines around ~2% growth (Morgan Stanley, Truist, consensus in CBS).  
   - Direction: mild **downward** pressure on the underlying “negative quarter” probability and thus on CP.

3) **Countervailing: tariffs/uncertainty + data gaps (Conference Board)** keep downside risk salient.  
   - Direction: stabilizes CP near current level (reduces chance of a big drop).

**Weak evidence (small pull)**
4) Administration “boom” claims (CBS) and miscellaneous market commentary: likely already priced/discounted by forecasters; may not move the median much.  
5) Immigration/population slowdown: plausible macro drag but not a “10-day CP mover” unless a major new datapoint drops (none indicated before Feb 14).

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- Time from today (2026-02-04) to resolution (2026-02-14): **~9.2 days**.
- With **half** the time (~4–5 days): even more inertia → probability of CP being >27% would fall slightly (fewer chances for updates).
- With **double** the time (~18–20 days): more forecasts and more macro releases/sentiment shifts could accumulate → probability would drift closer to ~50/50, depending on data flow.

### (d) Justification (how this shifts the outside view)
Outside view base rate given: **53% Yes** (slight upward drift expectation from knife-edge).

Inside view adjustments:
1) **Asymmetry from “> 27.00%” (not “≥”) + inertia**: if nothing happens, this tends to resolve **No**. That alone is a meaningful downgrade versus a naive “random walk around 27.”  
2) **Near-term news flow is more “soft-landing/moderate growth” than “imminent contraction”** (CNBC survey recession prob 23%; multiple 2026 GDP forecasts ~2%). With no major U.S. GDP release before Feb 14, I expect either *stability* or a *slight drift down*, not up.
3) **Downside-risk narratives persist** (tariffs, uncertainty, shutdown data gaps), which makes a sharp drop less likely—so I don’t go very low. But that stabilizing effect mostly increases probability of “stay ~27,” which still resolves **No**.

Net: I move from 53% to the low-40s.

Probability calibration
- Outside-view base rate: **53%**
- Adjustments:
  - Status quo / stickiness + strict “>” threshold: **-7 to -10 pts**
  - Recent expert consensus tilting slightly optimistic: **-2 to -4 pts**
  - Persistent uncertainty (tariffs/data gaps) preventing a larger drop: **+1 to +2 pts**
- Inside-view estimate: **43%** (Yes)

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: Yes iff CP on Q41089 is **>27.00%** at **2026-02-14 03:03:32**; else No.  
2) Outside view: 53%.  
3) Consistency: **43 out of 100** times, the CP ends up **strictly above 27.00%** by Feb 14.  
4) Top evidence:
   - CP stickiness + “>27” makes “no change” resolve No.
   - CNBC Fed survey: recession risk ~23%, GDP ~2.4% (downward pressure).
   - Multiple institutions forecast ~2% 2026 growth (not contraction).
   - Tariffs/uncertainty keep CP from falling far (stability, but stability favors No here).
5) Blind spot: a sudden negative macro shock (financial stress/geopolitical spike) triggers forecaster updates and pushes CP to ~30%+.  
6) Status quo: CP staying at/near 27 is plausible and implies **No**.

Probability: 43%
