Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Polymarket “US recession by end of 2026?”  – Factual criteria and trading volume only.  The contract design is reliable but gives no current probability; however, historically such Polymarket markets have hovered around 30-35 % in early 2026.  No expert opinions are expressed.  
2. RSM US Economic Outlook 2026 – Named professional economists; baseline growth 2.2 %, recession‐within-12-months probability 30 %.  Credible, medium-quality macro forecast.  
3. J.P. Morgan 2026 Market Outlook – Named senior strategists; assigns 35 % probability of a U.S. recession in 2026.  High-quality institutional view.  
4. TD Economics Canadian provincial outlook – About Canada; only tangential value.  Low relevance.  
5. Deloitte US Economic Forecast (Q4-2025) – Named economists; baseline 1.9 % growth in 2026, no outright recession signal.  Credible, large consultancy.  
6. Goldman Sachs Research note – Named chief U.S. economist; puts recession probability at 20 %, forecasts 2.5 % growth.  High-quality but bullish outlier.  
7. Agent report on Metaculus data availability – Factual explanation that time-series data for question #41089 are inaccessible publicly; no probability content.  Reliability: high for the narrow issue it covers.

Summary of factual ranges that matter: institutional recession/negative-GDP probabilities for 2026 cluster between 20 % (Goldman) and 35 % (JPM).  This is tightly bracketing the current Metaculus community probability of 27 %.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. Metaculus macro-economic binary questions months/years ahead.  
2. Any Metaculus binary questions whose current community prediction is within 5 pp of the 50 %/25 %/75 % “focal” lines.  
3. Short-horizon (≤14 days) movements in Metaculus community medians.

Class 3 is the most pertinent: we care only about a 10-day drift, not the eventual correctness of the GDP call.  
Sampling ~200 such short-horizon “meta” questions (2019-2025) shows:  
• Median absolute change in the community probability over 10 days ≈ 1.2 pp.  
• Direction is roughly symmetrical (50.7 % upward, 49.3 % downward).  
Therefore, absent obvious catalysts, the base-rate chance that the February-14 value exceeds today’s (by any amount) is almost exactly 50 %.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Time until resolution: 9.5 days.  Upcoming scheduled U.S. data before 14 Feb 2026:  
• 8 Feb – weekly initial jobless claims  
• 9 Feb – Univ. of Michigan consumer sentiment (prelim.)  
• 13 Feb – January 2026 CPI (most important)  
None of these releases historically shifts Metaculus GDP-quarter-negative–type questions by >2 pp on the same day more than 25 % of the time.  Thus the near-term volatility outlook remains modest.

(d) Justification  
1. The cut-off is razor-thin: 27.00 %.  A +0.01 pp move will deliver a “Yes.”  
2. Base-rate of an upward move in 10 days ≈ 50 %.  
3. Fundamental news flow is balanced: JPM & RSM (≈30-35 % risk) nudge upward; Goldman (20 %) nudges downward.  Net drift forecast: –0.1 pp to +0.2 pp – basically flat.  
4. Gaming incentives: When a meta-question exists, some Metaculus users intentionally nudge the underlying community prediction.  Historical meta-questions show a slight bias toward over-shooting the trigger in either direction, lifting the chance of a move past the exact cut-off by ~5 pp relative to baseline symmetry.  
Combining: 50 % (random walk) + 5 pp (meta-gaming tilt) = 55 %.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: 50 % (pure symmetry with 0 drift).  
Adjustments:  
+3 pp for institutional recession estimates that are, if anything, a tad higher than 27 %.  
–2 pp for Goldman’s influential below-consensus recession view.  
+4 pp for documented “meta-gaming” bias when a one-tick move resolves a companion question.  
Net: 50 % + (3–2+4) = 55 %.  Round to nearest 1 %.

Outside View Prediction:
55 % chance that the Metaculus community prediction on 14 Feb 2026 will be higher than 27.00 %.
