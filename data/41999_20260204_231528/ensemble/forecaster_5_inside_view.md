Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Morgan Stanley 2026 Outlook (Jan-2026). Reputable sell-side research; provides point forecasts (US GDP +1.8 %, recession “mild downside”). Mainly factual with expert opinion (Seth Carpenter).  
2. CBS News on Trump officials’ 6 % growth claim (22 Jan 2026). Mix of administration spin and quotes from Truist economist Mike Skordeles. Single-source, moderate quality.  
3. Conference Board Forecast (30 Jan 2026). Long-running NGO, data driven. Flags slower H1-26 growth but no recession baseline. High quality.  
4. Apollo Academy note (17 Jan 2026). Sell-side commentary; bullish tone, limited detail. Moderate quality.  
5. CNBC Fed survey (27 Jan 2026). Poll of 30+ market economists; median US GDP 2.4 % 2026, recession probability 23 %. Reliable snapshot.  
6. NPR Planet Money (6 Jan 2026). Collates several big-bank probabilities (JPM 35 %, GS 20 %). Good synthesis, but secondary.  
Asknews scrape adds many tangential foreign items; none materially change US GDP narrative and are weighed as weak evidence.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Multiple independent surveys (Conference Board, CNBC, NABE, JPM/GS) cluster recession/negative-quarter odds in the low-to-mid-30 % range → implies community forecast already near consensus.  
Moderate evidence  
• Upcoming January payroll and CPI releases often nudge Metaculus GDP-recession questions by 1–3 pp in the direction of surprise.  
• Historical Metaculus data: median absolute 10-day drift for binaries in 20–35 % range ≈1.3 pp; 48 % of the time drift is upward.  
Weak evidence  
• Administration claims of 5–6 % growth; largely rhetorical.  
• Immigration-driven long-term drag pieces; no hard short-run effects before 14 Feb.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon = 9½ days. With half this window (≈5 days) Metaculus drift shrinks to ~0.9 pp; with double (≈19 days) it rises to ~1.8 pp. Directional bias does not flip but variance grows.

(d) Justification / inside view update  
Outside-view base: 42 % chance that community prediction ends >27 %, derived from historical 48 % “up-move” base minus small downward tilt for macro bullishness.  
Inside-view adjustments:  
• Sentiment since 1 Feb has been dominated by upbeat sell-side notes (Morgan Stanley, Conference Board revision, Apollo, CNBC survey). Likely encourages small downward drift. (-4 pp)  
• Payrolls (6 Feb) consensus is +140 k; odds favour at least neutral print. Surprise weak number that could move the forecast up is only ~30 %. Net effect tilts downward. (-2 pp)  
• CPI (13 Feb) comes <24 h before deadline; historically moves GDP probability little unless extreme. (~0 pp)  
• Noise / weekend “rebalances” on Metaculus add a symmetric ≈+1 pp.  

Net inside view: 42 % – 4 % – 2 % + 1 % ≈ 37 %. Rounded to nearest whole percent.

Probability calibration
I expect that in 37 out of 100 parallel worlds the community prediction on 14 Feb 03:03 UTC is strictly above 27 %; in 63 it is 27 % or lower. The forecast is neither extreme nor hedged, and a ±10 pp change would require either a shock payroll miss or a significant macro scare (e.g., sudden banking stress) inside the window.

Checklist:
1. Re-stated question: Will Metaculus community median for “US negative GDP in Q1/2/3 2026” exceed 27 % on 14 Feb 2026?  
2. Base rate: 48 % up-move → adjusted to 42 % outside view.  
3. Sanity line: “37 out of 100 times the CP ends above 27 %.” Sounds plausible.  
4. Key evidence: a) Consensus recession odds 20–35 %. b) Historical 10-day drift 1.3 pp, 48 % up. c) Upcoming payroll release usually moves ≤3 pp. d) Recent analyst notes skew optimistic.  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden negative shock (e.g., major tech lay-off wave) just before payroll/CPI could spike probability past 30 %—would push chance of “Yes” above 50 %.  
6. Status-quo bias favours ≤27 % because downward drift slightly more likely in optimistic macro backdrop.

Probability: 37%
