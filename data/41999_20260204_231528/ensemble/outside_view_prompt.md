You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 27.00% on 2026-02-14 for the Metaculus question "Will the United States experience negative GDP growth during Q1, Q2, or Q3 2026?"?

Question background:
Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. 

--------------------------------

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41089
- Original question title: Will the United States experience negative GDP growth during Q1, Q2, or Q3 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-01: 27.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as **Yes** if the [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product) reports that the United States has experienced negative GDP growth during Q1, Q2, or Q3 of 2026, according to the BEA's [third estimate](https://www.bea.gov/news/blog/2015-07-13/why-does-bea-revise-gdp-estimates) for each quarter.

Original fine print: 
> If the BEA changes its release schedule and does not release a third estimate for a given quarter before 2027, this question will resolve based upon the latest estimate released in calendar year 2026.

Original background: 
> The United States has recently [experienced mixed](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product) GDP growth. During 2024, GDP growth ranged from  +0.8% up to +3.6% each quarter. During 2025, Q1 dropped substantially to -0.6% growth, while Q2 recovered to +3.8%.
> 
> The Bureau of Economic Analysis currently releases [3 successive estimates](https://www.bea.gov/news/blog/2015-07-13/why-does-bea-revise-gdp-estimates) for each quarter, with the final estimate released several months after the given quarter.

`{"format":"metaculus_binary_cp_rises","info":{"post_id":41089,"question_id":40794,"last_cp":0.27}}`

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41089) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-14 03:03:32 is higher than 27.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 27.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-14 03:03:32, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

# Summary of Goldman Sachs Article on US GDP Growth Projections for 2026

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**GDP Growth Forecasts:**
- Goldman Sachs Research projects US GDP will expand **2.5% in 2026** (Q4 year-over-year)
- This compares to consensus economist estimate of **2.1%**
- Full-year basis forecast: **2.8% growth**
- Recession probability in next 12 months: fallen from 30% to **20%**
- All forecasts as of January 11

**Inflation Forecasts:**
- Core PCE inflation estimated to fall to **2.1% by December** (year-over-year)
- Core CPI forecast to fall to **2.0%**
- These forecasts are **0.3 percentage points below consensus** estimates, FOMC forecasts, and market pricing
- Current core PCE inflation stalled at **2.8%** year-over-year
- Goldman Sachs estimates tariff passthrough has contributed **0.5 percentage point** to inflation
- Implies inflation excluding tariff effects has already fallen to **2.3%**
- Wage growth tracker has fallen by more than 2 percentage points to **3.5%**

**Labor Market Projections:**
- Unemployment rate expected to stabilize at **4.5%**
- Economy needs fewer than **70,000 jobs per month** to keep unemployment steady in 2026
- Underlying trend job growth estimated at **11,000 per month** (below breakeven rate)

**Federal Reserve Rate Cuts:**
- Goldman Sachs predicts **25 basis point cuts in June and September**
- Fed funds rate expected to finish cycle at **3%-3.25%**

## Key Opinions from Named Source:

**David Mericle, Chief US Economist at Goldman Sachs Research:**
- "Our strongest conviction views for 2026 are our above-consensus GDP growth forecast and our below-consensus inflation forecast"
- "The outlook for the labor market is more uncertain—we expect it to stabilize but see the possibility of further softening as the key risk for 2026"
- Key driver for solid growth: drag from tariff increases should give way to boost from tax cuts in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act
- "Tax cuts, real wage gains, and rising wealth should sustain solid consumer spending growth"
- "We are confident in part because we think there was actually meaningful progress" on declining inflation in 2025, masked by tariffs
- "We see the labor market as the most uncertain piece of the 2026 outlook"
- "We see a period of jobless growth similar to the 'jobless recovery' of the early 2000s as a plausible alternative scenario"
- Regarding AI and employment: "Because AI does not seem to have been a major driver of the decline in job growth so far, an increased reluctance to hire in anticipation of AI being able to replace workers in the near future would represent a new obstacle to maintaining full employment"

## Relevant Context:

The article presents a notably optimistic view for US GDP growth in 2026 compared to consensus, with Goldman Sachs forecasting stronger growth and lower inflation than other economists. The labor market is identified as the primary uncertainty/risk factor for 2026.

<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve historical community prediction time series and main arguments for Metaculus question 41089; identify major shifts since January 1 2026 and likely upcoming catalysts before February 14 2026
The third sweep of open-web sources again produced zero evidence that Metaculus question #41089 has ever been publicly visible. None of the URLs, code snippets or privacy-policy fragments returned in the latest result set mentions the numeric token “41089,” its putative title, or any forecast data. The findings from this round therefore corroborate the earlier conclusion that the object is currently inaccessible to the unauthenticated web.

What the new results do contribute is confirmation that the practical roadblock is almost certainly an access-control flag—“private,” “deleted,” or “unpublished”—rather than a search-engine indexing failure:

1. Absence of public or cached artefacts  
   • A Google query aimed at guidelines for private Metaculus questions produced no usable content (“No usable content extracted”), meaning Metaculus does not expose documentation that would accidentally list private IDs.  
   • No Wayback Machine hits surfaced, which rules out the possibility that #41089 was once public and merely became hard to discover through ordinary search.

2. Positive evidence that the API will return data if the question exists and the caller is authorised  
   • The open-source “forecasting-tools” Python package maintained by Metaculus itself demonstrates that the REST endpoint GET /api2/questions/{id}/ continues to work for authorised users and that historical timelines are retrievable via GET /api2/questions/{id}/timeline/ once the initial JSON is acquired (GitHub – Metaculus/forecasting-tools).  
   • A separate repository, “metaculus-tournament-export,” shows how users can bulk-export private data after pasting their personal API token into a .env file (GitHub – obrhubr/metaculus-tournament-export).  
   These examples prove that no structural change to the Metaculus back-end is blocking programmatic access; the barrier is credential-based.

3. Precedent for using personal or staff-issued tokens  
   • Several GitHub examples (“working-with-API.R” and “metaculus-rs”) include instructions for setting the environment variable METACULUS_TOKEN, supporting the inference that the platform’s normal policy is to allow authenticated researchers to download question objects as long as they possess a valid token.

Implications for each deliverable in the original query
------------------------------------------------------
1. Historical community-prediction time series  
   – Still unavailable from public sources.  
   – The timeline JSON is almost certainly present behind the authenticated endpoint and could be accessed instantly once a token with permission is supplied.

2. Main arguments for the question  
   – Discussion-tab threads, LessWrong cross-posts, EA-Forum articles or Discord debates have not surfaced publicly, again pointing to a visibility setting that hides ancillary content along with the question stem.

3. Major forecast shifts since 1 Jan 2026  
   – Impossible to compute without the time series. Even a coarse approximation (e.g., comparing only “now” versus “then” snapshots) cannot be produced because no snapshots exist.

4. Likely catalysts before 14 Feb 2026  
   – Any catalyst analysis would be speculation absent knowledge of the topic, historical shifts, or commentary. The responsible approach is to refrain from guessing.

Remaining information gaps
• Title, topic domain, resolution criteria, close date, status  
• Entire numeric time series: community median, confidence band, number of forecasters, timestamped history  
• Content of all discussion posts (arguments, cited evidence)  
• Quantitative identification of “major shifts,” including date, magnitude and direction  
• Mapping from past shifts to exogenous events, plus forward-looking catalyst list

Recommended next steps (non-public)
-----------------------------------
1. Authenticated API probe  
   Log in to Metaculus, open developer console and run:  
   fetch("https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/41089/")  
   – Status 200 returns the JSON, which embeds a “timeline” URL for the full time series.  
   – Status 403 indicates a private question; user must be on the access list.  
   – Status 404 means deleted or never published.

2. Use community tooling to capture the data once authorised  
   • forecasting-tools:  `pip install forecasting-tools` then  

     from forecasting_tools.metaculus import Metaculus  
     m = Metaculus(token="YOUR_TOKEN")  
     q = m.get_question(41089, include_timeline=True)  

   • metaculus-tournament-export: configure .env with METACULUS_TOKEN and run the script to dump CSV.

3. Contact Metaculus staff  
   Email contact@metaculus.com or post in the official Discord “#data-requests” channel; staff routinely grant temporary research access or will confirm whether the question is deleted.

4. Approach the question author  
   If #41089 is a private community question, the author can manually add your username to the access list.

Feasibility of further open-web searching
-----------------------------------------
Two full rounds of multi-variant queries plus the present follow-up produced no trace of the question. The pattern strongly indicates that additional public searches would waste time: the data are not merely “hard to find”; they are invisible. Therefore the research strategy must pivot from public scraping to authenticated retrieval or staff engagement.

Conclusion
----------
Based on all publicly available evidence—including the fact that sophisticated API wrappers succeed only with a valid token—it is impossible to deliver the requested historical time series, argument summaries, shift analysis or catalyst forecast for Metaculus question #41089 without first obtaining authorised access to the underlying question object. Until such access is granted, every item in the original query remains an information gap.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
