    "description": "Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41089\n- Original question title: Will the United States experience negative GDP growth during Q1, Q2, or Q3 2026?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-01: 27.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> This question will resolve as **Yes** if the [Bureau of Economic Analysis](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product) reports that the United States has experienced negative GDP growth during Q1, Q2, or Q3 of 2026, according to the BEA's [third estimate](https://www.bea.gov/news/blog/2015-07-13/why-does-bea-revise-gdp-estimates) for each quarter.\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> If the BEA changes its release schedule and does not release a third estimate for a given quarter before 2027, this question will resolve based upon the latest estimate released in calendar year 2026.\n\nOriginal background: \n> The United States has recently [experienced mixed](https://www.bea.gov/data/gdp/gross-domestic-product) GDP growth. During 2024, GDP growth ranged from  +0.8% up to +3.6% each quarter. During 2025, Q1 dropped substantially to -0.6% growth, while Q2 recovered to +3.8%.\n> \n> The Bureau of Economic Analysis currently releases [3 successive estimates](https://www.bea.gov/news/blog/2015-07-13/why-does-bea-revise-gdp-estimates) for each quarter, with the final estimate released several months after the given quarter.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41089,\"question_id\":40794,\"last_cp\":0.27}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41089) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-14 03:03:32 is higher than 27.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 27.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-14 03:03:32, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.",
