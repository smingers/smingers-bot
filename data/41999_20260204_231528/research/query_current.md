Analysis:
To judge whether the Metaculus community prediction will climb above 27 % by 14 Feb 2026, I want to understand how professional and popular narratives about the 2026 U.S. economic outlook are evolving right now (4 Feb 2026).  The community prediction is likely to react to:

1. Fresh hard data – first‐look (“advance”) Q4-2025 GDP release (published 29 Jan 2026) and January 2026 employment, inflation and PMI numbers that have appeared or will appear before 14 Feb.
2. Forward-looking forecasts – new projections from the Federal Reserve, Congressional Budget Office, IMF, major banks, and survey aggregators (Bloomberg, WSJ, Philly Fed).  Upward- or downward-revisions for 2026 Q1-Q3 growth, or talk of an outright recession, can quickly move the Metaculus median.
3. Financial-market signals – yield-curve inversion persistence, credit-spreads, and market-implied recession probabilities that commentators might cite.
4. Policy developments – any unexpected Fed stance change at the 29 Jan FOMC meeting, early hints from the President’s FY-2027 budget, or large fiscal packages being negotiated in Congress.
5. Sentiment pieces – business-cycle articles in major outlets framing “soft landing,” “stall-speed,” or “impending downturn,” which tend to influence forecasters’ priors.

I therefore need very recent coverage that incorporates the Q4-25 GDP advance estimate, new private-sector outlooks published around end-January / early-February 2026, and any emergent consensus (or dispute) about a 2026 slowdown.  The Google web search will pick up think-tank notes and bank research summaries that reach the open web; Google News will surface mainstream media and wire-service articles; and AskNews will retrieve paywalled or niche-economics pieces citing fresh forecasts.  Together these should give the “inside view” necessary to anticipate whether Metaculus users will push the probability above 27 % in the next ten days.
