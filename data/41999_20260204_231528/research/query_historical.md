Analysis:
To judge whether the Metaculus community prediction will rise above 27 % by 2026-02-14, I need (a) a baseline of recent Metaculus forecast movements on the target question, (b) near-term macroeconomic news or data releases scheduled before 14 Feb that could shift sentiment (e.g., January jobs report, CPI, Fed communications), and (c) economists’ published recession/GDP outlooks specifically referencing early- to mid-2026. Historical context on how similar probability questions have reacted to such data will also help. Key sources therefore include: the Metaculus question page (for time-series data and comment threads), mainstream coverage or research notes on U.S. recession odds in 2026, and the latest news about U.S. GDP expectations.
