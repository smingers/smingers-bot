The report attributes this growth to economic trends, including a projected US real GDP increase of 2.8% in 2024, slowing to 1.8% in 2025 due to tighter financial conditions and tariffs that raise costs for retailers. Inflation is expected to decline from 2.9% in 2024 to 2.3% by 2029, offering some relief, but consumers will continue to prioritize essentials. Demographic shifts are also a headwind, with the share of Americans aged 65 and over rising from 18.3% in 2024 to 20.3% in 2029, while unemployment is projected to rise to 4.2% in 2025, potentially reducing discretionary spending.

Despite a fertility rate of 1.6 children per woman\u2014slightly above Belgium\u2019s 1.47\u2014the U.S. remains below the replacement level of 2.1. Historically, population growth was sustained by a positive net migration, but this trend has reversed. The U.S. Census Bureau reported a 2025 population growth rate of just 0.5% (1.8 million new residents), the lowest since 2020\u20132021, following a 1% increase (3.2 million) in 2023\u20132024. This sharp slowdown is attributed to a dramatic drop in immigration, which fell from 2.7 million to 1.3 million between July 2024 and June 2025. The Brookings Institution estimates a net negative migration in 2025, ranging from -295,000 to -10,000. The decline is linked to Donald Trump\u2019s return to the White House, with policies emphasizing 'Make America Great Again' and stricter immigration enforcement. Over 230,000 individuals were deported in 2025, but the primary driver is reduced attraction for foreign workers and increased emigration. The U.S. Census Bureau has revised its population peak projection from 2081 to 2056, and further adjustments are possible. Economic consequences are anticipated, with a potential decline in GDP of up to 0.3% due to reduced workforce and consumer base. The era of mass immigration is considered over, with long-term demographic and economic implications.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 03:35 PM\nSource:[7sur7](https://www.7sur7.be/monde/la-politique-de-donald-trump-risque-daccelerer-le-declin-demographique-des-etats-unis~a4bc3a1fd/)\n\n**UPB Forecasts Italian GDP Growth of 0.7% in 2026 and 2027 Driven by PNRR and Domestic Demand**\nAccording to the February 2026 conjunctural note from the Italian Parliament Budget Office (UPB), Italy's GDP is projected to grow by 0.5% in 2025 when adjusted for fewer working days compared to 2024, and is expected to accelerate to 0.7% in both 2026 and 2027, driven by domestic demand and the implementation of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (PNRR). The global economic outlook remains uncertain due to geopolitical tensions, affecting energy prices, trade flows, and market expectations. Investors are increasing exposure to safe-haven assets like gold and silver, whose prices have risen for over two years. While the U.S. economy shows solid growth of about 2%, and China achieved a 5% GDP target with strong exports despite trade restrictions, Eurozone production remains subdued and uneven, with stronger performance in domestic-demand-driven economies and weaker results in export-oriented ones. The IMF forecasts global growth slightly above 3% for 2026\u20132027, but Eurozone growth would not exceed 1.5%. Global trade is expected to slow sharply from 4.1% in 2025 to 2.6% in 2026, negatively impacting export-dependent economies. The UPB revised its 2026 forecast upward due to less adverse international conditions and lower consumer prices, while the 2027 forecast was slightly adjusted downward. Risks remain skewed to the downside, linked to global conditions, financial market sentiment, and climate change. Employment is expected to expand moderately, with unemployment stabilizing around 6%. Wage growth remains moderate, leaving a significant gap in real wages compared to the pre-pandemic period. Inflation in Italy is projected to remain contained at 1.5% in 2025, below the Eurozone average. Household consumption is growing gradually, supported by a high savings rate of 11.4% in Q3 2025\u2014about four percentage points higher than pre-pandemic levels\u2014reflecting cautious consumer behavior. Business and household expectations remain stable, and investment remains relatively high at around 23% of GDP.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 12:41 PM\nSource:[La Repubblica](https://finanza.repubblica.it/News/2026/02/04/lupb_vede_pil_in_crescita_dello_0_7percento_nel_2026_e_2027-59/)\n\n**Upb Raises Italy's 2026 GDP Forecast to 0.7% Amid Domestic Demand and Pnrr Momentum**\nThe Italian Parliamentary Budget Office (Upb) has revised upward its GDP growth forecasts for Italy, projecting a 0.5% increase in 2025\u2014driven by a 0.3% acceleration in the fourth quarter\u2014and a strengthened 0.7% growth in 2026, supported by domestic demand and the implementation of the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (Pnrr). The 2027 forecast remains at 0.7%, with only a slight adjustment. These upward revisions stem from less adverse international conditions for external demand and lower consumer prices. However, risks remain tilted to the downside, primarily due to global geopolitical uncertainty, financial market volatility, and climate change. The global economy shows uneven performance: the U.S. is projected to grow by 2% in 2025, China is expected to achieve 5% GDP growth with strong exports despite trade restrictions, while the euro area is growing at a moderate and uneven pace, with domestic-demand-driven economies outperforming export-dependent ones. The Upb notes that the euro area's growth is expected to slow from 4.1% in 2025 to 2.6% in 2026, which could negatively affect export-oriented economies like Italy. On labor markets, employment is expected to expand at a moderate pace, with unemployment stabilizing around 6%. Wage growth remains moderate, leaving a significant real-terms pay gap compared to the pre-pandemic period. Despite low inflation in Italy (1.5% in 2025), which is below the euro area average, households remain cautious in spending, with savings rates reaching 11.4% in Q3 2025\u2014about four percentage points higher than pre-pandemic levels.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 12:19 PM\nSource:[Milano Finanza](https://www.milanofinanza.it/news/pil-upb-rivede-al-rialzo-le-stime-per-il-2026-allo-0-7-202602041304359025)\n\n**Gil do Vigor Condemns Economists' Failed Predictions on Lula's Government: 'Pathetic' - Revista F\u00f3rum**\nEconomist and former Big Brother Brazil contestant Gil do Vigor criticized financial market economists on social media for repeatedly making inaccurate negative predictions about the economic policies of President Lula's government (PT), calling it 'pathetic' to compare the austerity-driven fiscal measures of former President Jair Bolsonaro\u2014now imprisoned for an attempted coup\u2014to Lula's economic management. Gil argued that the previous government's cuts, largely in education, were not legitimate fiscal balance mechanisms. A comprehensive analysis revealed that the financial market's economic forecasts in Brazil were wrong 95% of the time between 2021 and 2024, with major indicators such as GDP, inflation, the Ibovespa, the Selic rate, and the dollar consistently overestimated. In 2023, GDP grew by 2.9% instead of the projected 0.78%, and inflation (IPCA) ended at 4.62% versus a forecast of 5.36%. The overall accuracy rate of these forecasts was only 5%, with the Ibovespa's 2022 performance being the sole accurate prediction. President of the PT, Gleisi Hoffmann, echoed these concerns on X (formerly Twitter), stating that the financial market lacks legitimacy as an economic critic due to its repeated errors. She noted that economists who failed in their forecasts are now criticizing Lula\u2019s fiscal and monetary policies. The Bank of America\u2019s 'LatAm Fund Manager Survey' and the Central Bank\u2019s Focus Bulletin\u2014used to guide monetary policy\u2014were found to rely on 100 conservative economists whose predictions were frequently inaccurate. Despite initial conservative projections, Brazil's 2024 economic performance exceeded expectations: GDP growth rose from a forecast of 1.59% to a final estimate of 3.49%, the public debt-to-GDP ratio ended at 62.80% (down from a projected 64.25%), and the primary result improved from a projected deficit of 0.8% to a surplus of 0.5%, within the fiscal framework\u2019s target. The government's success was attributed to increased public investment and industrial revaluation.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 08:07 PM\nSource:[Revista F\u00f3rum](https://revistaforum.com.br/economia/gil-do-vigor-detona-previsoes-furadas-de-economistas-sobre-o-governo-lula-patetico/)\n\n**Inflation Target of 3% Unlikely to Be Achieved in 2026, Analysts Predict**\nAccording to a consensus of 41 private national and international economic analysis groups surveyed by Banco de M\u00e9xico (Banxico), the inflation target of 3% will not be achieved in 2026 or 2027. Analysts predict two rate cuts by the end of 2026, bringing the reference interest rate down to 6.50%. Banxico aims to return to the target inflation level by the third quarter of 2026 and maintain it stable for the following 12 months. The upcoming monetary policy announcement on Thursday, 2026, will include updates on inflation forecasts for both general and core inflation. The consensus forecast for general inflation rose from 3.88% to 3.95% for 2026 and from 3.70% to 3.73% for 2027. Core inflation, excluding energy and fresh food prices, increased to 4.11% from 3.90% in the previous survey, while remaining unchanged at 3.75% for 2027. The forecast for the interbank funding rate remains at 6.50% for both 2026 and 2027. Economic expectations for 2026 are slightly more favorable, with GDP growth projected at 1.30% (up from 1.15%), but revised downward for 2027 (1.80%, down from 1.85%) and 2028 (1.80%, down from 1.86%). The long-term average growth forecast for the next 10 years is 1.80%. Analysts cited ongoing challenges in governance\u2014such as public insecurity and corruption\u2014as key obstacles, along with external conditions. The percentage of analysts expecting a deterioration in business climate over the next six months rose from 15% to 20%, while those expecting it to remain unchanged fell from 64% to 55%, and only 20% believe it will improve.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 06:38 PM\nSource:[El Universal](https://www.eluniversal.com.mx/cartera/meta-de-inflacion-sera-inalcanzable-en-2026-preven-analistas-ven-2-recortes-a-tasa-de-interes-este-ano-segun-encuesta-de-banxico/)\n\n**Transilvania Bank Prognosis : Economic growth of 1.67% of GDP in 2026 based on five pillars**\nBanca Transilvania forecasts Romania's economic growth at 1.67% of GDP in 2026, driven by five structural pillars: (I) long-term public and EU-funded investments, particularly through the Recovery and Resilience Facility (RRF), supporting infrastructure, energy transition, digitization, and innovation; (II) gradual industrial recovery fueled by improving external conditions and easing domestic cost pressures; (III) sustained strength in the ICT sector, which contributes to productivity and export growth; (IV) moderate stabilization of consumption due to declining inflation and gradual real income recovery, though consumption will not return to pre-2022 levels; and (V) a slightly improved external balance, with lower import growth and stronger exports reducing the negative impact of net trade. The Central Bank is expected to maintain a restrictive monetary policy, with the first rate cut likely in the second half of 2026, gradually lowering the key interest rate to 5.75% from 6.50%. Inflation (IPC) is projected to drop from nearly 10% at the end of 2025 to 4.3% by the end of 2026, with a more visible decline expected in the second half of the year. The leu/euro exchange rate is forecast to depreciate slightly to 5.17 by end-2026, from 5.10 at end-2025, with risks of further depreciation from political uncertainty, persistent inflation, or fiscal slippage, and potential support from large EU fund inflows or stronger foreign sector performance. Unemployment is projected at 6% in 2026, up from 5.9% in 2025, due to planned public sector staff cuts and hiring freezes, though private sector job creation is expected to offset this trend. Youth unemployment remains a key vulnerability. The general government budget deficit is expected to narrow to 6.5% of GDP in 2026 from 8.4% in 2025, attributed to the full-year impact of the 2025/2026 consolidation package (wage and pension freezes, higher indirect taxes, spending limits). However, public debt is projected to rise to 61.8% of GDP in 2026, up from 59.7% in 2025, due to persistent deficits and financing needs. According to Ioan Nistor, head-economist at Transilvania Bank, '2026 is estimated to be the year when Romania\u2019s growth model, based on investments, will become more visible, with the potential to improve both medium-term productivity and economic resilience.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 05:15 PM\nSource:[ACTmedia News](http://actmedia.eu/daily/transilvania-bank-prognosis-economic-growth-of-1.67-of-gdp-in-2026-based-on-five-pillars/117920)\n\n**Moderate Growth Forecast for Friuli Venezia Giulia: 0.5% GDP Increase Expected in 2026 and 2027**\nThe Friuli Venezia Giulia (Fvg) economy is projected to grow moderately in 2026 and 2027, with GDP increasing by 0.5% each year, following a 0.4% rise in 2025 and a 1.0% increase in 2024. These growth rates are below pre-pandemic levels (1.7% in 2017, 1.3% in 2018, 1.1% in 2019) and below those of the Northeast Italy (+0.8% in 2026, +0.7% in 2027) and the Euro Area (+1.3% in 2026, +1.4% in 2027). The regional performance in 2026 is expected to be constrained by less favorable foreign trade dynamics due to global uncertainty, a stronger euro, and ongoing geopolitical tensions. Household consumption is forecast to grow by 0.8% in both 2026 and 2027, though a high savings propensity persists. Gross fixed investments may slow to +1.0% in 2026 and decline by -1.4% in 2027, reflecting a contraction in the construction sector and the exhaustion of funds linked to the National Recovery and Resilience Plan (Pnrr). Exports are expected to grow modestly by +1.8% in 2026 and accelerate to +3.5% in 2027, supported by a recovery in the German economy and improved U.S. economic cycles. Imports are projected to fall by -0.8% in 2026 and rise by +1.1% in 2027. Employment units are expected to grow by 0.5% in both 2026 and 2027, after near-stability in 2025 (-0.1%). The employment rate is forecast to rise from 69.6% in 2025 to 70.3% in 2026 and 71.0% in 2027, compared to 66.6% in 2019. The unemployment rate is expected to remain stable at 4.6% in 2026 and decline to 4.3% in 2027. Industrial value added is projected to grow by 0.6% in 2026 and 0.8% in 2027, while construction will see a slight decline of -0.1% in 2026 and a significant contraction of -4.7% in 2027. The services sector, after stagnation in 2025 (0.0%), is expected to resume growth with +0.6% in 2026 and +0.7% in 2027. According to Luigino Pozzo, President of Confindustria Udine, 'the Italian economy has faced strong pressures due to geopolitical instability, but in 2025 it held up, with positive results also for Fvg. 2026 will be challenging, but we have many encouraging signals that the ongoing recovery may mark the beginning of a favorable period. The government's stability policy is a strength, but we need stronger, more durable measures to support growth: greater investments in innovation and concrete structural tax reductions on labor'.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 12:10 PM\nSource:[ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/friuliveneziagiulia/notizie/2026/02/03/crescita-moderata-per-il-fvg-nel-2026-il-pil-aumentera-dello-05_0ae430dc-72d4-47a3-ba21-a12a4d8c05fc.html)\n\n**U.S. Economy Grows in 2026, Latin America Faces High Interest Rates and Uneven Recovery**\nThe U.S. economy is projected to grow by 2.2% in 2026, according to Coface economists Marcos Carias and Patricia Krause, driven by strong consumption from high-income households, a heated stock market, and robust investment in AI and infrastructure. Consumption is highly concentrated among the top 20% of earners, who account for 50% to 60% of total spending, benefiting from asset appreciation. Inflation remains above the Federal Reserve's 2% target at 2.7%, with expectations of rising to near 3% in the coming months. Despite elevated tariffs, their impact has been absorbed by U.S. firms, pressuring margins, and the Fed has kept interest rates stable, with market projections indicating up to two rate cuts in 2026, contingent on inflation. In Latin America, economic growth is forecast at 2.3% in 2026, similar to 2025, but with significant country-level disparities. The region faces persistent high interest rates, trade pressures from U.S. tariffs on steel, aluminum, and a 10% base tariff on most Latin American countries, alongside uncertainty over the U.S.-Mexico trade agreement. Despite these challenges, exports have shown resilience due to market diversification. In Brazil, inflation ended 2025 within target range, and Coface projects the first interest rate cuts starting in March 2026, with the Selic rate expected to end the year at 12.25%. GDP growth is forecast at 1.9% in 2026, reflecting ongoing constraints from high rates on consumption, credit, and investment. Argentina is projected to grow by 3.4% in 2026, above the regional average, driven by disinflation (from 284% in April 2024 to 31.5% by end-2025) and improved household consumption, supported by a more favorable business environment. Patricia Krause concluded that while growth is expected, risks remain high due to elevated interest rates, trade uncertainty, and uneven recovery, requiring careful credit and liquidity management, especially in finance-sensitive economies.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[Portal Contabeis](https://www.contabeis.com.br/artigos/74946/economia-eua-cresce-em-2026-america-latina-enfrenta-juros-altos/)\n\n**Economic Forecast Slower Due To Lower Immigration, New Data Confirms**\nNew U.S. Census Bureau population estimates for the period from June 30, 2024, to July 1, 2025, confirm slower population growth, driven primarily by reduced net foreign immigration. This trend suggests future economic growth will be slower, as population growth is a key component of economic expansion. Dr. Bill Conerly notes that while natural population increase (births minus deaths) has been low, most fluctuations in total population stem from net migration. Immigration has declined significantly since the Biden administration\u2019s peak, with projections indicating near-zero net migration under new border enforcement policies. Although immigrants are often lower-skilled and earn lower wages, they complement high-skilled workers\u2014such as in construction or plumbing\u2014where their labor increases overall productivity. Despite this, a decline in immigration reduces the labor supply, particularly in sectors reliant on low-skilled workers like agriculture, food processing, construction, restaurants, and hotels. Labor productivity is expected to grow at about 2% annually, slightly above the long-term average, partly due to early AI integration. With near-zero population growth and 2% productivity growth, inflation-adjusted GDP is projected to grow by slightly over 2% in 2026 and 2027\u2014slower than past decades and less than what could be achieved with higher immigration. While not recessionary, this slower growth implies reduced optimism in business planning, especially for industries serving low-wage consumers. The economy can remain healthy without high immigration, but its size and structure will differ.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 04:31 PM\nSource:[TalkMarkets](https://talkmarkets.com/content/economic-forecast-slower-due-to-lower-immigration-new-data-confirms?post=554279)\n\n**Economic Forecast 2026: Growth Will Defy Slowdown Fears**\nThe economic forecast for 2026 indicates sustained growth despite widespread concerns about a slowdown. The U.S. economy demonstrated strong performance in the third quarter of 2025, with inflation-adjusted GDP growth reaching 4.3%, well above the 2.2% average since 2000. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's preliminary estimate for fourth-quarter GDP growth is 5.1%, though this is not an official forecast. Although layoff announcements were high in 2025\u2014exceeding pandemic-era levels\u2014December filings for unemployment insurance were very low, indicating a current 'layoff drought.' Job growth remains constrained by stagnant domestic working-age population growth, with net immigration declining sharply under the Trump administration, likely resulting in near-zero net immigration in 2025. The unemployment rate rose to 4.4% in December, up 0.3 percentage points over the past year, but this figure may be skewed due to declining response rates in telephone surveys, particularly among immigrants. Labor productivity has trended at about 2% annually, with early AI-driven gains in programming and customer service, though aggregate productivity gains remain modest. On the demand side, consumers continue to spend, with low-income workers receiving pay raises exceeding inflation\u2014larger than those for higher-income groups\u2014over the past six years. Business investment in equipment and intellectual property has increased, despite reduced construction activity, while government spending and net exports have also grown. Federal Reserve policy remains nearly neutral, with no indication of further rate cuts due to persistent inflation. Tariffs are not yet affecting domestic prices but are expected to have a minor negative impact on manufacturing by increasing input costs. Overall, the economy is expected to grow moderately in 2026, with business plans based on 2025 averages likely to remain viable. The article advises organizations to prepare contingency plans for both downturns and unexpected growth, noting that while pessimism sells more, long-term data shows optimism is more accurate.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 16, 2026 12:00 PM\nSource:[TalkMarkets](https://talkmarkets.com/content/economics--politics/economic-forecast-2026-growth-will-defy-slowdown-fears?post=550590)\n\n**U.S. Jobs Rise by 50,000, Unemployment at 4.4%: NY Stock Market Rises**\nIn December 2025, U.S. non-farm jobs increased by 50,000, falling short of the projected 73,000, while the unemployment rate held steady at 4.4%, down from 4.5% in November. Despite the weaker-than-expected job growth, the decline in unemployment was viewed positively, contributing to a broad rally in the New York Stock Exchange. Economic analysts attribute the sluggish hiring to uncertainty caused by former President Trump\u2019s unpredictable tariff policies, persistent high inflation, and the rapid expansion of AI adoption. Retail lost 25,000 jobs, and manufacturing and construction also saw declines, suggesting a weaker-than-usual holiday hiring season. The sharp drop in immigration under Trump\u2019s immigration restrictions has reduced the need for job creation to maintain stable unemployment levels, suggesting that the 50,000 job increase may not signal a severe downturn. However, job growth slowed significantly after April 2025, with monthly gains dropping from an average of 110,000 in Q1 to just 10,000 from June to August, and rebounding only slightly to 22,000 in November. Annual job growth for 2025 totaled 584,000, the lowest since the pandemic, marking the weakest year for job creation since 2020. Despite this, the U.S. economy grew strongly in Q3 2025, expanding at a 4.3% rate\u2014the highest in two years\u2014driven by robust consumer spending. The Atlanta Fed forecasts 2.7% growth for Q4 2025, still solid. While the Federal Reserve previously cut rates three times in 2024 to stimulate the economy, the recent decline in unemployment and continued strong growth have reduced expectations for further rate cuts in early 2026. Capital Economics stated that the labor market is 'not as bad as it seems,' and the Fed is unlikely to rush into additional rate cuts. Inflation remains elevated, with consumer prices rising 2.7% year-on-year in November, above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. According to Shana Orchik, CEO of Banlion Capital Management, 'While the employment data is negative for those hoping for rate cuts, we\u2019re also reassured by the economy\u2019s resilience.'\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: January 09, 2026 08:44 PM\nSource:[YTN](https://www.ytn.co.kr/_ln/0104_202601100504017660)\n\n**U.S. Q3 Growth Surpasses Expectations; New Report Signals Economic Optimism for 2026**\nThe U.S. economy in the third quarter of 2025 exceeded expectations, with the annualized GDP growth rate reaching 4.3%, significantly higher than the projected 2.5% and the highest quarterly increase in two years, according to a report released by the U.S. Department of Commerce. President Trump, in a post on Truth Social, attributed the strong growth to his economic policies, stating it signals substantial job creation with high wages and will contribute significantly to GDP growth within a year. He criticized the current market reaction to positive news, noting that strong economic data now often leads to flat or declining stock markets due to expectations of immediate interest rate hikes to curb 'potential' inflation. Trump emphasized that sound policies\u2014not strong markets\u2014prevent inflation, and urged the next Federal Reserve Chair to cut rates during good market conditions rather than destabilize them. Current Fed Chair Jerome Powell\u2019s term ends in May 2026. Support for Trump\u2019s economic performance comes from political figures and economists, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, who said he would be 'shocked' if economic prosperity hadn't arrived by July 2026. Navy Federal Credit Union Chief Economist Heather Long told AFP that consumer resilience shown in the data signals positive outlooks for 2026, especially if mass layoffs are avoided. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent predicted accelerated economic growth early in 2026, with inflation stabilizing and declining in the first half of the year, and real wages rising. Earlier Bloomberg surveys showed a median GDP growth forecast of 3.2%\u20133.3% for Q3, which proved overly conservative. A follow-up survey of 84 economists from December 12\u201317 projected a median 2026 GDP growth of 2% (up from 1.9%) and a slight downward revision of inflation expectations from 2.9% to 2.8%. Interest rate expectations remained unchanged: the rate ceiling is expected to fall to 3.25% by end-2026, down from the current 3.75%, indicating a gradual policy easing. JPMorgan analysts forecast the S&P 500 could reach 7,500 points by end-2026, with two 25-basis-point rate cuts in 2026 expected to drive an 18% rise, continuing a second consecutive year of double-digit gains.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 24, 2025 11:35 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/12/24/n14661889.htm)\n\n**U.S. Economy Surges with 4.3% Q3 Growth Amid Concerns Over Uneven Foundation**\nThe United States experienced strong economic growth in the third quarter of 2025, with a 4.3% annualized GDP increase, according to a delayed report released by the U.S. Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA). This marked a significant acceleration from the previous quarter's 3.8% growth and surpassed analysts' expectations of around 3.2% growth. The BEA uses annualized figures to project yearly trends based on quarterly data, and this rise represented a 1.1% increase from the second quarter, driven primarily by an 'acceleration in consumption.' Investment slightly declined during the period. The data, described as preliminary, were released nearly two months late due to the government shutdown from October 1 to November 12, which halted statistical agency operations. Despite the positive headline, financial markets reacted negatively, with Wall Street expected to open in the red. Analysts noted that the strong GDP figure gives the Federal Reserve (Fed) more reason to maintain its current monetary policy stance, undermining market expectations of a rate cut on January 28, 2026, which had been anticipated to stimulate growth and corporate profits. The U.S. economy has shown volatile quarterly swings: a surprise contraction of -0.6% in early 2025 due to a surge in imports ahead of anticipated tariffs under former President Donald Trump, followed by a rebound in the second quarter fueled by reduced imports and sustained consumption. Looking ahead, Fed officials project 2025 GDP growth at 1.7% compared to 2024, with year-over-year growth at 2.8% by the end of 2024\u2014before Trump's return to the White House. The U.S. administration attributes the growth to its 'pro-growth' policies, including tariffs, tax cuts, and deregulation, and highlights upcoming tax credits for households in 2026. Pantheon Macroeconomics forecasts these credits will have a 'moderate' impact on growth, as consumer confidence remains low, suggesting households may save much of the benefit. Economists warn the growth is uneven, heavily reliant on artificial intelligence (AI) investments and data center construction, while traditional sectors lag. Paul Gruenwald, economist at S&P, stated, 'The foundation of growth is narrow,' adding, 'The big question for next year is whether this narrow base will hold. Generally, the thinner the foundation, the more likely it is to erode.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 23, 2025 02:08 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/88VK9KE)\n\n**U.S. Economy Forecasts Mild 2026 Growth Amid Persistent Job Market Weakness and Stagnant Inflation**\nAccording to a new survey by the National Association for Business Economics (NABE), the U.S. economy is projected to grow slightly in 2026, with a forecasted growth rate of 2.0%, up from 1.8% in October and 1.3% in June. This growth is expected to be supported by increased consumer spending and corporate investment, though new Trump administration tariffs could reduce growth by more than 0.25 percentage points. Inflation is projected to ease to 2.9% by the end of 2025 (down from 3.0% in October) and further to 2.6% in 2026, with economists attributing much of this trend to tariff impacts. Labor market growth is expected to continue slowing, with the unemployment rate projected to rise to 4.5% by early 2026 and remain at that level through year-end. The Federal Reserve is anticipated to cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points in December 2025 and an additional 0.5 percentage points in 2026, bringing policy rates closer to neutral. Despite strong economic indicators\u2014such as a 3.8% annualized growth rate in Q2 2025, the fastest since Q3 2023, and an Atlanta Fed\u2019s upward revision of Q3 real GDP to 4.2%\u2014economists warn of persistent risks. Former PIMCO co-founder Bill Gross expects further rate cuts due to ongoing market volatility and economic pressure. JP Morgan CEO Jamie Dimon and Moody\u2019s Senior Economist Mark Zandi both caution that recession risks remain high, with Zandi describing the risk as 'uncomfortably high.' Additionally, Treasury Secretary Scott Bessenet noted that the 43-day government shutdown caused a 1.5% GDP hit. U.S. Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick projected the possibility of 6% GDP growth under Trump\u2019s administration, citing manufacturing and construction booms and tariff-driven capital investment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 09:45 PM\nSource:[Benzinga Korea](https://www.benzinga.com/content/49028971/2026)\n\n**Economists Predict Stronger U.S. Growth and Persistent Inflation in 2026**\nEconomists surveyed by the National Association for Business Economics (NABE) in their year-end forecast, conducted from November 3 to 11, predict a U.S. economic growth of 2% in 2026, up from 1.8% in the previous October survey and significantly higher than the 1.3% projected in June. The forecast cites increased personal spending and business investment as key growth drivers, partially offset by a projected 0.25 percentage point or more drag from new Trump-era import tariffs. The panel identified 'tariff impacts' as the top negative risk to U.S. economic outlook, citing both high probability and significant potential impact. Stricter immigration enforcement is also seen as a growth dampener, while stronger productivity is viewed as the most likely factor to push growth above expectations. Inflation is expected to end 2026 at 2.9%, slightly below the 3% forecast in October, and decline only slightly to 2.6% in 2027, with tariffs responsible for between 0.25 and nearly 0.75 percentage points of that figure. Employment growth is forecast at around 64,000 jobs per month\u2014modest by historical standards but faster than expected for the end of 2025. The unemployment rate is projected to rise to 4.5% in early 2026 and remain there through the year. Given persistent inflation and only a slight further increase in unemployment, the Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates by 0.25 percentage points in December 2025, followed by a further 0.5 percentage point reduction in 2026, moving closer to a neutral policy rate.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 24, 2025 01:53 PM\nSource:[Terra](https://www.terra.com.br/economia/economistas-preveem-crescimento-mais-forte-nos-eua-e-inflacao-persistente-em-2026,ff91356d53b1887babba2c41a1d2b88cyz728c06.html)\n\n**NABE Economists Revise U.S. GDP Growth Forecast for 2025 to 1.8%**\nAccording to a National Association for Business Economics (NABE) survey conducted between September 17 and 25, 2025, U.S. economists have revised their 2025 GDP growth forecast upward to 1.8%, up from 1.3% in June. The 2026 GDP growth forecast remains at 1.8%. The survey of 40 economists also indicates that consumer price inflation (PCE index) is expected to rise by 3% in 2025 (down from 3.1% previously) and 2.5% in 2026 (up from 2.3%). Despite weaker consumption and global trade growth, business investment is projected to offset these declines, maintaining economic growth near the long-term trend. However, slow job growth, elevated unemployment, and higher inflation are seen as negative factors. Over 60% of respondents believe new import tariffs introduced under former President Donald Trump continue to hinder economic growth, potentially reducing GDP by up to 0.5 percentage points, with negative impacts on trade and higher consumer prices. No respondent believes tariffs boost GDP. Unemployment is forecast to rise to 4.5% in 2025 (down from a previous 4.7%) and is expected to reach 4.3% in August 2025. Job creation is projected at an average of 29,000 per month through the end of 2025, gradually recovering to about 75,000 in 2026 (down from a June forecast of 97,000). Economists still expect the Federal Reserve to lower interest rates, though at a slower pace than previously anticipated, with only one rate cut expected in 2025.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 11:50 AM\nSource:[Interfax.ru](https://www.interfax.ru/business/1052351)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
