The labor market is identified as the primary uncertainty/risk factor for 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve historical community prediction time series and main arguments for Metaculus question 41089; identify major shifts since January 1 2026 and likely upcoming catalysts before February 14 2026\nThe third sweep of open-web sources again produced zero evidence that Metaculus question #41089 has ever been publicly visible. None of the URLs, code snippets or privacy-policy fragments returned in the latest result set mentions the numeric token \u201c41089,\u201d its putative title, or any forecast data. The findings from this round therefore corroborate the earlier conclusion that the object is currently inaccessible to the unauthenticated web.\n\nWhat the new results do contribute is confirmation that the practical roadblock is almost certainly an access-control flag\u2014\u201cprivate,\u201d \u201cdeleted,\u201d or \u201cunpublished\u201d\u2014rather than a search-engine indexing failure:\n\n1. Absence of public or cached artefacts  \n   \u2022 A Google query aimed at guidelines for private Metaculus questions produced no usable content (\u201cNo usable content extracted\u201d), meaning Metaculus does not expose documentation that would accidentally list private IDs.  \n   \u2022 No Wayback Machine hits surfaced, which rules out the possibility that #41089 was once public and merely became hard to discover through ordinary search.\n\n2. Positive evidence that the API will return data if the question exists and the caller is authorised  \n   \u2022 The open-source \u201cforecasting-tools\u201d Python package maintained by Metaculus itself demonstrates that the REST endpoint GET /api2/questions/{id}/ continues to work for authorised users and that historical timelines are retrievable via GET /api2/questions/{id}/timeline/ once the initial JSON is acquired (GitHub \u2013 Metaculus/forecasting-tools).  \n   \u2022 A separate repository, \u201cmetaculus-tournament-export,\u201d shows how users can bulk-export private data after pasting their personal API token into a .env file (GitHub \u2013 obrhubr/metaculus-tournament-export).  \n   These examples prove that no structural change to the Metaculus back-end is blocking programmatic access; the barrier is credential-based.\n\n3. Precedent for using personal or staff-issued tokens  \n   \u2022 Several GitHub examples (\u201cworking-with-API.R\u201d and \u201cmetaculus-rs\u201d) include instructions for setting the environment variable METACULUS_TOKEN, supporting the inference that the platform\u2019s normal policy is to allow authenticated researchers to download question objects as long as they possess a valid token.\n\nImplications for each deliverable in the original query\n------------------------------------------------------\n1. Historical community-prediction time series  \n   \u2013 Still unavailable from public sources.  \n   \u2013 The timeline JSON is almost certainly present behind the authenticated endpoint and could be accessed instantly once a token with permission is supplied.\n\n2. Main arguments for the question  \n   \u2013 Discussion-tab threads, LessWrong cross-posts, EA-Forum articles or Discord debates have not surfaced publicly, again pointing to a visibility setting that hides ancillary content along with the question stem.\n\n3. Major forecast shifts since 1 Jan 2026  \n   \u2013 Impossible to compute without the time series. Even a coarse approximation (e.g., comparing only \u201cnow\u201d versus \u201cthen\u201d snapshots) cannot be produced because no snapshots exist.\n\n4. Likely catalysts before 14 Feb 2026  \n   \u2013 Any catalyst analysis would be speculation absent knowledge of the topic, historical shifts, or commentary. The responsible approach is to refrain from guessing.\n\nRemaining information gaps\n\u2022 Title, topic domain, resolution criteria, close date, status  \n\u2022 Entire numeric time series: community median, confidence band, number of forecasters, timestamped history  \n\u2022 Content of all discussion posts (arguments, cited evidence)  \n\u2022 Quantitative identification of \u201cmajor shifts,\u201d including date, magnitude and direction  \n\u2022 Mapping from past shifts to exogenous events, plus forward-looking catalyst list\n\nRecommended next steps (non-public)\n-----------------------------------\n1. Authenticated API probe  \n   Log in to Metaculus, open developer console and run:  \n   fetch(\"https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/41089/\")  \n   \u2013 Status 200 returns the JSON, which embeds a \u201ctimeline\u201d URL for the full time series.  \n   \u2013 Status 403 indicates a private question; user must be on the access list.  \n   \u2013 Status 404 means deleted or never published.\n\n2. Use community tooling to capture the data once authorised  \n   \u2022 forecasting-tools:  `pip install forecasting-tools` then  \n\n     from forecasting_tools.metaculus import Metaculus  \n     m = Metaculus(token=\"YOUR_TOKEN\")  \n     q = m.get_question(41089, include_timeline=True)  \n\n   \u2022 metaculus-tournament-export: configure .env with METACULUS_TOKEN and run the script to dump CSV.\n\n3. Contact Metaculus staff  \n   Email contact@metaculus.com or post in the official Discord \u201c#data-requests\u201d channel; staff routinely grant temporary research access or will confirm whether the question is deleted.\n\n4. Approach the question author  \n   If #41089 is a private community question, the author can manually add your username to the access list.\n\nFeasibility of further open-web searching\n-----------------------------------------\nTwo full rounds of multi-variant queries plus the present follow-up produced no trace of the question. The pattern strongly indicates that additional public searches would waste time: the data are not merely \u201chard to find\u201d; they are invisible. Therefore the research strategy must pivot from public scraping to authenticated retrieval or staff engagement.\n\nConclusion\n----------\nBased on all publicly available evidence\u2014including the fact that sophisticated API wrappers succeed only with a valid token\u2014it is impossible to deliver the requested historical time series, argument summaries, shift analysis or catalyst forecast for Metaculus question #41089 without first obtaining authorised access to the underlying question object. Until such access is granted, every item in the original query remains an information gap.</Agent_report>\n"
