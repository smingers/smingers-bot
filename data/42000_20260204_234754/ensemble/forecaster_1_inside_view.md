Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Outside View Materials (Pre-Feb 4):**
- **Fox News (Jan 29)**: Detailed coverage of Klobuchar's gubernatorial announcement, Walz's fraud scandal, ICE shootings. Factual reporting with expert opinion from Amy Koch (Republican strategist). High reliability for facts, though Koch's political analysis is partisan-informed.
- **NBC News (Jan 29)**: Mainstream coverage of announcement with context on state issues. Factual, reliable.
- **NPR (Jan 29)**: Focus on ICE enforcement context. Tom Homan's statements are factual; Clay Masters' analysis about voter attention spans is expert opinion but speculative.
- **Valley News Live (Feb 3)**: Reports on precinct caucuses. Factual event coverage identifying Klobuchar as "frontrunner."
- **Red Lake Nation News (date unclear)**: Coverage of Klobuchar's ICE statements. Limited sourcing information.

**AskNews Articles (Jan 22 - Feb 4):**
- **Multiple sources (Jan 22)**: Reports of Klobuchar filing campaign paperwork. Consistent across ABC, KTTC, Brainerd Dispatch. Factual, reliable.
- **Star Tribune (Jan 30, Feb 2)**: Analysis of Klobuchar's candidacy strength, precinct caucuses. Former Gov. Arne Carlson's praise is expert opinion. Reports of "uncommitted" votes in Minneapolis precincts are factual but represent specific progressive neighborhoods.
- **KSTP/SurveyUSA Poll (Jan 27-30)**: Klobuchar leads Jensen 49-35%, double-digit lead. **STRONG EVIDENCE** - scientific polling with methodology. Larry Jacobs (political analyst) opinion that immigration issue "incinerated" fraud concerns is expert analysis.
- **CBS News (Feb 3)**: Reports thousands attended caucuses, strong turnout. Factual event coverage.
- **Newsweek (Feb 3)**: Poll analysis, betting markets show 89% Democratic chance. Combines polling data (strong) with prediction markets (moderate).
- **Multiple sources (Feb 4)**: Reports on synthetic DNA bill co-sponsored by Klobuchar and Cotton. Factual but irrelevant to search interest prediction.
- **Le Huffington Post (Feb 4)**: Testimony of Aliya Rahman about ICE detention. Klobuchar praised her testimony. Factual event but limited national reach (French publication covering US news).
- **La Nacion (Feb 4)**: Spanish-language coverage of Klobuchar candidacy. Factual biographical information.

**Key Factual Timeline:**
- Jan 22: Filed campaign paperwork
- Jan 29: Formal announcement
- Feb 1: Google Trends value = 15
- Feb 3: Precinct caucuses (major state political event)
- Feb 4: Current Google Trends value = 9
- Feb 5-12: Prediction window

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE:**
1. **Rapid decay pattern (15→9 in 3 days)**: The Google Trends value dropped 40% from Feb 1 to Feb 4. This demonstrates active decay from the announcement spike. With Feb 5 being day 7 post-announcement and Feb 12 being day 14, we're firmly in the decay phase. **This strongly suggests continued decline or stabilization near baseline.**

2. **No scheduled events Feb 5-12**: Agent report explicitly found no confirmed TV appearances, rallies, or major announcements. Without catalysts, search interest typically decays. **This strongly supports "Doesn't change" or "Decreases".**

3. **Precinct caucuses on Feb 3**: This was a significant state political event that likely generated search interest on Feb 3-4. However, this event is BEFORE our Feb 5 starting point, meaning any spike from caucuses will already be reflected in the Feb 5 baseline. **Neutral to slightly negative for our window.**

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**
1. **State-level race, not national**: Gubernatorial races generate less sustained national search interest than presidential or high-profile Senate races. The poll showing Klobuchar with strong leads suggests the race may not be competitive enough to generate sustained interest. **Supports lower volatility, favoring "Doesn't change".**

2. **Baseline stabilization**: Current value (9) is very close to 90-day mean (8.9). This suggests return to equilibrium. Standard deviation of 16.9 indicates historical volatility, but much of that was likely from the 2020 presidential run and other major events. **Supports "Doesn't change".**

3. **"Uncommitted" votes in Minneapolis progressive precincts**: Reports show 30/50 and 70/89 voters choosing "uncommitted" over Klobuchar in specific Minneapolis neighborhoods. This suggests potential progressive dissatisfaction, but these are hyper-specific precincts not representative of broader interest. **Weak negative signal.**

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**
1. **Synthetic DNA bill (Feb 4)**: Klobuchar co-sponsored legislation, but this is routine Senate work unlikely to generate significant search interest compared to her gubernatorial campaign. **Minimal impact.**

2. **Aliya Rahman testimony (Feb 4)**: Klobuchar praised ICE detainee's testimony. While potentially newsworthy in Minnesota, this is not a Klobuchar-centric story. **Minimal impact.**

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 8 days (Feb 5 to Feb 12, 2026)

**Current trajectory:** 
- We're measuring two points: Feb 5 (day 7 post-announcement) vs Feb 12 (day 14 post-announcement)
- Both dates are in the post-spike decay phase
- Current value (9) suggests Feb 5 will likely be 8-10 range

**If timeframe were halved (4 days, Feb 5-9):**
- Shorter window = less time for decay or unexpected events
- Would increase "Doesn't change" probability to ~60%
- Would decrease "Decreases" to ~25%
- Would decrease "Increases" to ~15%

**If timeframe were doubled (16 days, Feb 5-21):**
- Longer window = more opportunities for new events or complete baseline stabilization
- Would decrease "Doesn't change" to ~40%
- Would increase "Decreases" to ~35% (more time for decay)
- Would increase "Increases" to ~25% (more opportunities for unexpected events)

**Key insight:** The 8-day window is long enough for decay to continue but short enough that we're unlikely to see major new catalysts unless something unexpected occurs.

## (d) Justification

**Starting from outside view base rates:**
- Increases: 18%
- Doesn't change: 51%
- Decreases: 31%

**Factors warranting adjustment:**

1. **Precinct caucuses timing (STRONG)**: The Feb 3 caucuses were a major state political event that would normally generate search interest. However, this event occurs BEFORE our Feb 5 starting point. Any spike from caucuses will be captured in the Feb 5 baseline value, not as movement within our window. This is a critical timing consideration that the outside view didn't fully account for. **This shifts probability away from "Increases" and toward "Doesn't change" or "Decreases".**

2. **Rapid decay already observed (STRONG)**: The 15→9 drop in just 3 days (40% decline) demonstrates aggressive mean reversion. This is faster than typical political announcement decay, suggesting the market has already absorbed the news. By Feb 5, we'll be at a stabilized baseline. **This shifts probability from "Decreases" toward "Doesn't change"** - the rapid decay means less room for further decline.

3. **No events scheduled (STRONG)**: Agent report confirms no scheduled events. This removes the primary mechanism for increases. **Shifts probability from "Increases" toward other categories.**

4. **Poll showing non-competitive race (MODERATE)**: The 14-point lead (49-35%) suggests the race may lack drama to sustain interest. Non-competitive races generate less ongoing coverage. **Slight shift from "Increases" toward "Doesn't change".**

**Revised assessment:**

The critical realization is that by Feb 5, we'll already be at a post-caucus, post-announcement baseline (likely 8-10 range). The question becomes: Will this baseline hold steady or continue declining slightly over the next week?

**Against "Increases" (reducing from 18%):**
- Caucuses already happened (before our window)
- No scheduled events
- Non-competitive race polling
- Adjust to: 12%

**For "Doesn't change" (increasing from 51%):**
- Already at baseline (9 ≈ 8.9 mean)
- Rapid decay suggests equilibrium reached
- Low volatility expected without events
- 8-day window not long enough for major unexpected developments
- Adjust to: 58%

**For "Decreases" (adjusting from 31%):**
- Some continued decay possible (9→6-7 range)
- But rapid decay already occurred, suggesting most adjustment complete
- Limited room to fall from near-baseline
- Adjust to: 30%

## Probability Calibration

**Base rate anchoring check:** My outside view had "Doesn't change" at 51%, and I'm adjusting to 58%. This is a modest 7-point increase, justified by the specific timing of the precinct caucuses (before our window) and the observed rapid decay suggesting equilibrium has been reached.

**Confidence calibration:** The 58% for "Doesn't change" reflects moderate confidence, not certainty. This is appropriate given:
- Politics can generate unexpected news (scandals, gaffes, viral moments)
- Google Trends can be volatile
- We're dealing with a state-level race where national interest is limited

**Blind spot consideration:** The most likely scenario to make this forecast wrong would be:
1. Unexpected viral moment or controversy (12% allocated to "Increases")
2. Major new development in Walz fraud scandal implicating Klobuchar
3. ICE-related incident generating renewed Minnesota coverage
4. Late-breaking campaign event not yet scheduled

However, these remain relatively low probability within an 8-day window for a state-level race.

**90% vs 99% consideration:** My 58% for "Doesn't change" represents approximately 1.4:1 odds. If I were 70% confident, that would be 2.3:1 odds - this would require much stronger evidence that the baseline will hold. If I were 45% confident, that would be near 1:1 odds - this would suggest I have no real insight. The 58% reflects genuine moderate confidence based on the evidence.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Predict if Google Trends value for "Amy Klobuchar" on Feb 12 will be within 3 points (no change), >3 points higher (increase), or >3 points lower (decrease) compared to Feb 5.

2. **Base rate alignment:** Outside view: 51% no change, 31% decrease, 18% increase. Final: 58% no change, 30% decrease, 12% increase. Modest shift justified by timing of caucuses and observed rapid decay.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = "Doesn't change" (already at baseline, no events); Least likely = "Increases" (no catalysts, caucuses already passed). This aligns with justification.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Rapid decay 15→9 in 3 days suggests equilibrium reached (STRONG)
   - No scheduled events Feb 5-12 per agent report (STRONG)
   - Precinct caucuses Feb 3 before prediction window (STRONG)
   - Current value 9 ≈ 90-day mean 8.9 (MODERATE)
   - Poll shows non-competitive race (MODERATE)

5. **Blind spot:** Unexpected viral moment, scandal, or ICE-related incident could generate spike. Allocated 12% to "Increases" to account for political unpredictability. If this occurs, "Increases" would be correct and my 58% "no change" would look overconfident.

6. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs, all between 0-100.
