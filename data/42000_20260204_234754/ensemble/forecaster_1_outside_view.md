Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Government Documents (Feb 4, 2026):**
- Two GovInfo sources listing Senate committee assignments
- High reliability; purely factual administrative records
- Show Klobuchar on Agriculture, Commerce, Joint Economic, and Joint Library committees
- No predictive value for search interest

**News Articles (Jan 29, 2026):**
- Citizens' Voice/AP, KSAT, CNN, Click on Detroit all report Klobuchar's gubernatorial announcement on Jan 29, 2026
- High-quality mainstream sources with consistent factual reporting
- Key facts: She's the 4th sitting senator running for governor in 2026; announced after Gov. Walz dropped out amid child care funding scandal
- Expert opinion from Matt Dallek (GWU political historian) on Senate dysfunction is credible but relates to general trends, not specific search patterns
- These are 6-day-old announcements as of Feb 4, 2026

**CNN Fast Facts (Updated Feb 18, 2019, with Jan 29, 2026 addition):**
- Biographical reference document
- Confirms Jan 29, 2026 gubernatorial launch as most recent major event

**Agent Report:**
- Comprehensive search for scheduled events Feb 5-12
- Finds NO confirmed TV appearances, rallies, or major announcements
- Notes Senate Judiciary hearing on Feb 4 (outside target window)
- Identifies possible but unscheduled events: campaign rally, late Sunday show booking, investigation developments
- Conclusion: "expectations for a nationally galvanising Klobuchar moment between 5 and 12 February 2026 should remain low"

**Google Trends Data:**
- Current value (Feb 4): 9
- 90-day mean: 8.9, std dev: 16.9
- Recent 7-day average: 27.9 (reflecting post-announcement spike)
- Base rate: 43% of 12-day windows show ≤3 point change; 57% show >3 point change

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Post-announcement decay for political candidacy launches:**
   - Relevant: Klobuchar announced Jan 29; we're forecasting Feb 5-12 (7-14 days post-announcement)
   - Pattern: Initial spike followed by decay unless sustained by new events
   - Suitability: HIGH - directly applicable

2. **Generic Google Trends behavior for politicians:**
   - Politicians typically spike around major events, then return to baseline
   - Baseline for Klobuchar: ~9 (current value matches 90-day mean of 8.9)
   - Suitability: MEDIUM - provides context but less specific

3. **Senator-to-governor campaign interest patterns:**
   - Limited historical data; relatively rare occurrence
   - State-level races generate less national interest than federal
   - Suitability: LOW - too few comparable cases

**Selected reference class:** Post-announcement decay for political candidacy launches

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 8 days (Feb 5-12, 2026)

**Timeline context:**
- Jan 29: Announcement (spike likely occurred)
- Feb 1: Question written, current value = 15
- Feb 4: Today, current value = 9 (already declining from 15)
- Feb 5: Start of prediction window
- Feb 12: End of prediction window

**Historical pattern analysis:**
- The 7-day average of 27.9 suggests values were elevated in late Jan/early Feb post-announcement
- Current value of 9 is back near baseline (90-day mean: 8.9)
- The decline from 15 (Feb 1) to 9 (Feb 4) shows rapid normalization
- Agent report confirms no scheduled events for Feb 5-12

**Key observation:** We're measuring Feb 5 vs Feb 12, both AFTER the announcement spike has already occurred and begun decaying. The question is whether interest will continue declining, stabilize, or unexpectedly increase.

## (d) Justification

The announcement spike has already occurred (Jan 29) and is decaying. By Feb 5, we'll be 7 days post-announcement; by Feb 12, 14 days post-announcement. Without new catalysts:

**Factors favoring "Doesn't change" (±3 points):**
- Values already near baseline (9 vs 8.9 mean)
- Low volatility expected in absence of events
- Base rate shows 43% of periods have ≤3 point changes

**Factors favoring "Decreases" (>3 point drop):**
- Natural decay pattern after announcement spikes
- No scheduled events to sustain interest
- Minnesota gubernatorial race is state-level, not national news
- Agent report explicitly states low expectations for galvanizing moments

**Factors favoring "Increases" (>3 point rise):**
- Unexpected events (unscheduled rally, breaking news, investigation development)
- Late Sunday show booking
- However, agent found no evidence of such planning

The critical insight: We're comparing two points (Feb 5 and Feb 12) both in the post-spike decay phase. The value on Feb 5 will likely be similar to current (8-10 range), and Feb 12 will depend on whether decay continues or stabilizes at baseline.

Given the 90-day mean of 8.9 and std dev of 16.9, plus the absence of scheduled events, the most likely scenario is values hovering near baseline with minor fluctuations.

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring to base rates:**
- 43% historical rate for ≤3 point change provides a floor
- But this includes periods WITH events; our period has none scheduled
- Should adjust upward for "Doesn't change"

**Probability distribution considerations:**
- The announcement spike is behind us (already decaying from 15→9)
- Feb 5 value likely 8-10; Feb 12 value depends on decay trajectory
- Three scenarios:
  1. Stabilizes at baseline: 8-10 on both dates = "Doesn't change"
  2. Continues gradual decay: 9→6 = "Decreases" 
  3. Unexpected event causes rise: 9→13+ = "Increases"

**Upset rate consideration:**
- Politics can generate unexpected news (scandals, gaffes, viral moments)
- But Klobuchar is experienced, and Minnesota race is low-profile nationally
- Estimate 15-20% chance of unexpected event generating >3 point swing

**Calibration:**
- "Doesn't change": Should be plurality given stabilization near baseline
- "Decreases": Significant probability given decay pattern, but limited room to fall (already at 9)
- "Increases": Low but non-trivial given political unpredictability

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 18%
Doesn't change: 51%
Decreases: 31%
