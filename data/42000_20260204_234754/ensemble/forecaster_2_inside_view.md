Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Fox News (Jan 29, 2026):** Detailed coverage of Klobuchar's gubernatorial announcement. High-quality national source. Key facts: Klobuchar announced Jan 29; Walz dropped out amid fraud scandal; immigration enforcement issues prominent. Opinion elements clearly attributed to RGA spokesperson and strategist Amy Koch.

**NBC News (Jan 29, 2026):** Mainstream national outlet confirming same announcement date and key facts. Factual reporting with minimal opinion content. Corroborates Fox reporting.

**NPR (Jan 29, 2026):** Public radio coverage of announcement. Adds context about Tom Homan's visit and ICE drawdown plans. Factual with expert commentary from Clay Masters (MPR reporter) on political dynamics.

**Valley News Live (Feb 3, 2026):** Local coverage of precinct caucuses held Feb 3. Factual reporting identifying Klobuchar as DFL frontrunner. Timely and relevant to prediction window.

**Red Lake Nation News (Feb 2, 2026):** Coverage of Klobuchar's immigration stance. Factual account of her "ICE out" statements. Local perspective.

**AskNews Articles (Feb 4, 2026):** Multiple sources confirming Klobuchar's continued prominence:
- KBZN (Feb 4): Comprehensive recap of her entry into race
- Huffington Post (Feb 4): ICE testimony hearing where Klobuchar praised witness
- Investing.com/Reuters (Feb 4): Synthetic DNA bill co-sponsored by Klobuchar
- La Nacion (Feb 4): Spanish-language coverage of candidacy
- Yahoo/Minnesota sources (Feb 4): Caucus night coverage showing "uncommitted" votes in progressive precincts
- Newsweek (Feb 3): Poll showing Klobuchar with 14-point lead
- Star Tribune (Feb 2-3, Jan 30): Multiple articles on caucuses and her candidacy strength
- CBS Minnesota (Feb 3): Caucus coverage mentioning ICE concerns
- Earlier articles (Jan 22): Filing paperwork, preliminary steps

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Launch spike already occurred (Jan 29):** Multiple independent sources confirm Klobuchar announced Jan 29, 2026. This is 7 days before the measurement window starts (Feb 5). Google Trends typically shows peaks on announcement day/next day, then decay. The current value of 15 (as of Feb 1) is already elevated above the 90-day mean of 8.9. **This strongly suggests the measurement window will capture post-peak decay, favoring "Decreases."**

2. **No major scheduled events Feb 5-12:** Agent report and news scan show no major Klobuchar appearances, debates, or announcements scheduled. Precinct caucuses occurred Feb 3 (before window). No primary debates scheduled yet (primary is August). **Absence of catalysts favors "Doesn't change" or "Decreases."**

**Moderate Evidence:**
3. **Caucus results showing progressive resistance (Feb 3-4):** Multiple sources report significant "uncommitted" votes in Minneapolis progressive precincts despite Klobuchar being sole major DFL candidate. However, this is local/niche news unlikely to drive national search interest. Moderate relevance.

4. **Ongoing ICE/immigration controversy:** Multiple articles mention ICE issues, but the acute crisis (fatal shootings) occurred in January. By Feb 5-12, this is becoming background noise rather than breaking news. Moderate but declining relevance.

5. **Synthetic DNA bill (Feb 4):** Klobuchar co-sponsored legislation, but this is routine Senate business unlikely to drive significant search interest. Weak to moderate evidence of continued baseline activity.

**Weak Evidence:**
6. **Poll showing 14-point lead (Feb 3):** News but not dramatic enough to drive sustained search interest. Confirms frontrunner status but doesn't create new momentum.

7. **"Melania" documentary audience reaction:** Anecdotal mention of audience hostility to Klobuchar's screen appearance. Irrelevant to search trends.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction window:** Feb 5-12 (8 days). Current date is Feb 4.

The critical insight is **temporal positioning relative to the news cycle:**
- Major announcement occurred Jan 29 (7 days before window starts)
- Google Trends typically peaks within 24-48 hours of major news
- Current value (Feb 1) of 15 is already elevated
- By Feb 5, we're 7 days post-announcement

**If timeframe were halved (4 days, Feb 5-8):** Would increase probability of "Doesn't change" since less time for decay. Might see 40% no change, 35% decrease, 25% increase.

**If timeframe were doubled (16 days, Feb 5-20):** Would strongly increase probability of "Decreases" as more time passes without new catalysts. Might see 15% increase, 25% no change, 60% decrease.

The 8-day window is long enough for post-announcement decay but short enough that baseline noise could keep it stable.

**(d) Justification:**

**Base rate:** 29% Increase, 41% No change, 30% Decrease

**Key adjustments:**

1. **Post-announcement decay pattern (Strong, -15% from No change, +10% to Decrease, +5% to Increase):** The launch spike occurred Jan 29. Current value of 15 (Feb 1) is already 68% above the 90-day mean of 8.9. Historical patterns show Google Trends interest decays after announcement peaks unless sustained by new events. With no major events scheduled Feb 5-12, natural decay is likely. However, some residual elevated interest may persist, preventing a dramatic drop.

2. **Absence of catalysts (Moderate, -5% from Increase, +5% to No change):** No scheduled debates, major speeches, or breaking news expected. This reduces probability of increases and slightly favors stability.

3. **Measurement window positioning (Moderate, -5% from No change, +5% to Decrease):** Starting measurement 7 days post-announcement means we're likely past the peak but potentially in a decay phase. The Feb 5 value will be a critical anchor.

4. **Background political activity (Weak, +2% to Increase):** Ongoing Senate activity (DNA bill) and continued news coverage provide minimal sustained interest.

**Net adjustments:**
- Increase: 29% + 5% + 2% - 5% = 31%
- No change: 41% - 15% + 5% - 5% = 26%
- Decrease: 30% + 10% + 5% = 45%

However, there's significant uncertainty about whether Feb 5 value will be elevated or already declining. The resolution criteria compare Feb 12 to Feb 5, not to current levels. If Feb 5 is still elevated (say, 12-15), then decay to 9-12 by Feb 12 would trigger "Decreases." If Feb 5 has already declined to 8-10, then stability around that level would trigger "Doesn't change."

**Blind spot consideration:** The biggest uncertainty is the Feb 5 starting value. If it's already declined significantly from the Feb 1 value of 15, then the window might capture stability rather than continued decay. This uncertainty warrants spreading probability more evenly between "Decrease" and "No change."

**Probability Calibration:**

Given the strong evidence for post-announcement decay but uncertainty about the starting point (Feb 5 value), I'll adjust to:

- **Decrease: 42%** (most likely due to natural decay from announcement peak)
- **No change: 35%** (plausible if Feb 5 value has already stabilized)
- **Increase: 23%** (requires unexpected news or sustained interest, less likely but possible)

This represents a moderate shift from the base rate, justified by the clear temporal pattern of being post-announcement but tempered by uncertainty about exact positioning in the decay curve.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Google Trends value for "Amy Klobuchar" on Feb 12 be >3 points higher (Increase), within ±3 points (No change), or >3 points lower (Decrease) than Feb 5?

2. **Base rate:** 29% Increase, 41% No change, 30% Decrease. My prediction shifts toward Decrease due to post-announcement decay pattern.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = Decrease (42%); Least likely = Increase (23%). Makes sense given Jan 29 announcement and lack of Feb 5-12 catalysts.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Jan 29 announcement = 7 days before window (validates decay hypothesis)
   - Current Feb 1 value of 15 elevated above 8.9 mean (confirms spike occurred)
   - No major events scheduled Feb 5-12 (reduces increase probability)
   - Caucus on Feb 3 before window starts (no catalyst in measurement period)
   - 8-day window allows time for decay but introduces measurement uncertainty

5. **Blind spot:** If Feb 5 value has already declined to near-baseline (8-10 range), then "No change" becomes more likely than "Decrease." Alternatively, unexpected breaking news (scandal, major endorsement, Trump tweet) could drive "Increase." This warrants not being overconfident in Decrease.

6. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, are between 0-100, no % signs.
