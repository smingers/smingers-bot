Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Government Documents (Feb 4, 2026):**
- Two GovInfo documents listing Klobuchar's committee assignments
- High reliability, purely factual administrative records
- No predictive value for search trends; routine procedural documents

**News Articles (Jan 29, 2026):**
- Multiple AP-sourced articles (Citizens' Voice, KSAT, ClickOnDetroit) reporting Klobuchar's gubernatorial announcement
- CNN Fast Facts article updated with Jan 29 announcement
- High reliability, factual reporting of a major political development
- Key fact: Klobuchar announced her Minnesota governor campaign on January 29, 2026
- Context: She's the 4th sitting senator running for governor in 2026; Gov. Walz dropped out amid scandal
- Expert opinion from Matt Dallek (GWU political historian) explains broader trend but doesn't predict search interest

**Agent Report (Feb 4, 2026):**
- Comprehensive search for scheduled events Feb 5-12, 2026
- Findings: No confirmed major announcements, TV appearances, or investigation milestones
- Notes routine Senate Judiciary activities on Feb 4-5 (outside target window or low-visibility)
- Identifies polling showing Klobuchar leads but characterizes as "reactive analyses, not scheduled announcements"
- Assessment: "expectations for a nationally galvanising Klobuchar moment between 5 and 12 February 2026 should remain low"

**Google Trends Data:**
- Current value (Feb 1): 15 (per question background)
- Current value (Feb 4): 9 (per data provided)
- 90-day mean: 8.9, std dev: 16.9
- Recent 7-day average: 27.9 (vs prior 7 days: 23.9)
- Base rate: 43% of 12-day windows show ≤3 point change; 57% show >3 point change

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Post-major-announcement decay pattern**: Politicians typically see search spikes immediately after major announcements (Jan 29), followed by gradual decline unless new catalysts emerge
   - Suitability: HIGH - Klobuchar's Jan 29 announcement explains the recent elevated values (27.9 avg last 7 days)

2. **Senator gubernatorial campaigns generally**: Search interest patterns for sitting senators running for governor
   - Suitability: MEDIUM - Relevant but limited data on comparable cases

3. **Minnesota political figures**: Historical search patterns for Minnesota politicians
   - Suitability: MEDIUM - Geographic specificity useful but doesn't account for national vs. local interest dynamics

4. **12-day Google Trends windows for political figures**: The empirical base rate from the data
   - Suitability: HIGH - Directly applicable, though doesn't account for specific context

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: Post-major-announcement decay pattern combined with empirical 12-day window base rates.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: Feb 5-12, 2026 (8 days total)
- Question asks about change from Feb 5 value to Feb 12 value
- Today is Feb 4, so Feb 5 is tomorrow and Feb 12 is 8 days away

**Timeline Context:**
- Jan 29: Major announcement (gubernatorial campaign launch) - 7 days before Feb 5
- Feb 1: Value was 15 (per question background)
- Feb 4: Value is 9 (per Google Trends data) - showing decline from 15
- Recent 7-day average: 27.9 suggests the spike occurred around Jan 29-Feb 2

**Historical Pattern:**
- The data shows recent trend as "increasing" with last 7 days avg (27.9) vs prior 7 days (23.9)
- However, the current value of 9 (Feb 4) is well below the recent 7-day average, suggesting we're already in the decay phase
- 90-day mean is 8.9, very close to current value of 9

## (d) Justification

The critical insight is timing: Klobuchar's gubernatorial announcement occurred Jan 29, creating a predictable spike in search interest that peaked around Jan 29-Feb 2 (explaining the 27.9 recent average). By Feb 4, the value has already declined to 9, very close to the 90-day baseline of 8.9.

The Feb 5-12 window begins **after** the announcement-driven spike has largely dissipated. The agent report confirms no scheduled catalysts for the target period. Typical post-announcement patterns show:
1. Immediate spike (days 0-3)
2. Rapid decay (days 4-7) ← We're here now
3. Return to baseline (days 8-14) ← Target window falls here

Given:
- Feb 5 value will likely be close to current 9 (near baseline of 8.9)
- No scheduled events Feb 5-12 to drive new interest
- Natural decay pattern suggests continued low/stable values
- Baseline of 8.9 suggests equilibrium around 8-10

The question requires >3 point change to resolve as "Increases" or "Decreases". With values likely hovering near 8-10 throughout the period, staying within 3 points is most probable.

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring to Base Rates:**
- Empirical data: 43% "Doesn't change" (≤3 points), 57% changes >3 points
- However, this 57% includes periods with scheduled events, scandals, or other catalysts
- Current context has no known catalysts, suggesting lower than 57% chance of >3 point movement

**Distribution Considerations:**
- The 90-day std dev of 16.9 is high, but driven by occasional spikes (like the Jan 29 announcement)
- Between spikes, values tend to cluster near the mean (8.9)
- We're in a post-spike, pre-catalyst period

**Upset Rate Adjustment:**
- Political news is inherently unpredictable (scandals, breaking news, Trump administration actions)
- Agent report notes potential for "unannounced" events (late rally booking, investigation developments)
- Minnesota-specific news (ICE incidents, fraud investigations) could generate secondary coverage
- However, even unexpected events during Feb 5-12 would need to be sufficiently major to move values >3 points from baseline

**Probability Reasoning:**
- Strong expectation: Values remain 8-11 range (near baseline), supporting "Doesn't change"
- Moderate probability: Continued decay below 6 or unexpected catalyst pushing above 12
- Lower probability: Major unexpected event causing sharp movement in either direction

Given we're in a post-announcement decay phase with no scheduled catalysts, I weight "Doesn't change" higher than the 43% base rate, while maintaining meaningful probability for unexpected developments.

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 18%
Doesn't change: 61%
Decreases: 21%
