Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
- Using the fixed US Google Trends URL (2026-01-13 to 2026-02-12), compare the daily value for “amy klobuchar” on 2026-02-05 vs 2026-02-12.  
- “Doesn’t change” = within ±3; “Increases” = +4 or more; “Decreases” = −4 or more.

(a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality/date; facts vs opinion)

- Fox News (Jan 29, 2026) — Klobuchar launches MN governor bid; heavy emphasis on fraud scandal + ICE crackdown context.  
  Quality: mixed (political framing), but the core fact of candidacy launch is corroborated elsewhere. Primarily facts; some loaded language/opinion in narrative.

- NBC News (Jan 29, 2026) — Straight report on her entering governor’s race; context of shootings/ICE, fraud investigation, field dynamics.  
  Quality: high for factual timeline. Mainly facts; limited interpretation.

- NPR (Jan 29, 2026) — Focus on ICE “surge,” Tom Homan involvement, press conference timing; connects environment to politics.  
  Quality: high; mostly facts plus clearly attributed analysis.

- Valley News Live (Feb 3, 2026) — MN caucuses begin Feb 3 with gubernatorial straw polls; Klobuchar listed as DFL frontrunner.  
  Quality: decent local reporting. Mostly facts; minimal opinion.

- Red Lake Nation News (date unclear / truncated) — Mentions “ICE out of Minnesota” line; suggests it as early test of her run.  
  Quality: uncertain due to incomplete citation/date; treat as weak support/background.

AskNews items (Feb 2–4, 2026):
- Reuters write-up syndicated via Investing.com / U.S. News (Feb 4) — Cotton + Klobuchar introduce synthetic DNA screening bill (biosecurity).  
  Quality: very high (Reuters). This is a *fresh, discrete* national-news hook likely to generate short-lived searches around Feb 4–5.

- Yahoo (Feb 4) — “Thousands of Minnesota Democrats turn out on caucus night”; some “uncommitted” protest votes; critiques from activists.  
  Quality: generally solid (likely local reporting syndicated). Mix of facts (turnout, straw poll results in examples) and opinion (quoted activists).

- CBS News (Feb 3) and Star Tribune explainer (Feb 2) — caucus/ICE/protest context; Klobuchar as main DFL candidate.  
  Quality: high. Mostly factual.

- Newsweek (Feb 3) — poll + horse-race framing; cites KSTP/SurveyUSA; mentions markets like Kalshi.  
  Quality: mixed; polling claim plausibly real but Newsweek framing can be sensational. Treat the *existence of polling coverage* as moderately relevant to searches.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted vs resolution criteria)

Key question is directional change from Feb 5 to Feb 12 (threshold ±3). Evidence that affects whether Feb 5 starts “elevated” and then fades, or whether new spikes appear near Feb 12:

Strong evidence
- Post-announcement attention decay pattern: Jan 29 campaign launch produced a spike that already appears to be decaying toward baseline (outside-view notes Feb 4 value near baseline). This structural pattern strongly favors “no big move” *unless* Feb 5 is temporarily re-elevated. (Strong because historically robust for politicians absent fresh events.)

Moderate evidence
- Fresh Feb 3–4 news cycle: MN caucuses (Feb 3) + multiple articles about her candidacy (Feb 4) + Reuters bill (Feb 4) are plausible to keep searches modestly elevated into Feb 5, then fade by Feb 12. Mechanism: short-lived news-driven searches. This pushes probability toward “Decreases” (higher starting point on Feb 5, lower by Feb 12). (Moderate: clear mechanism, but magnitude uncertain.)
- No identified scheduled “Feb 10–12” catalyst: the provided collection does not show a clear, timed event late in the window that would raise Feb 12 above Feb 5 by >3. This reduces “Increases.” (Moderate: absence-of-evidence is weaker, but still informative for a short horizon.)

Weak evidence
- Activist dissatisfaction (“uncommitted” caucus votes) could generate some local chatter; unclear if it moves national Google searches materially. (Weak.)
- Ongoing ICE controversy could flare unexpectedly; unpredictable. (Weak-to-moderate as a blind-spot risk, but not a directional forecast by itself.)

Net directional implication:
- Compared with the outside view, I see slightly higher odds that Feb 5 is a bit “propped up” by Feb 3–4 coverage and then mean-reverts by Feb 12 → more “Decreases.”
- “Increases” requires a new, later-in-window headline; not impossible, but less supported by current info.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Forecast window: from tomorrow (Feb 5) to 8 days later (Feb 12). Very short horizon.
- If timeframe were halved (~4 days, Feb 5→Feb 9): less time for decay; “Doesn’t change” would rise, “Decreases” would fall somewhat.
- If timeframe were doubled (~16 days, Feb 5→~Feb 21): more time for attention to drift back toward baseline; “Decreases” would rise further unless new events intervene.

(d) Justification (updating the outside view base rates)
Outside view probabilities were: Increases 18 / Doesn’t change 61 / Decreases 21.

Why adjust?
- The outside view assumed the big Jan 29 spike had mostly dissipated and that Feb 5 would likely start near baseline. But the inside-view news flow shows *additional* nationally syndicated Klobuchar hooks right before the window (Feb 3 caucus coverage; Feb 4 Reuters biosecurity bill; multiple Feb 4 “enters governor’s race” recaps). That cluster increases the chance Feb 5 prints slightly higher than where Feb 12 ends up.
- Still, none of the sources indicate a likely *late-window* headline that would systematically elevate Feb 12 above Feb 5 by >3, so “Increases” should not rise.

So I shift some mass from “Doesn’t change” to “Decreases,” while leaving “Increases” roughly similar/slightly lower.

Probability calibration

- Increases: modestly lower than outside view because no obvious Feb 10–12 trigger is identified; requires an unexpected event.
- Doesn’t change: still the modal outcome because many political figures oscillate within a narrow band absent major breaks, and the threshold is ±3 (not tiny).
- Decreases: meaningfully higher than outside view due to the plausible “Feb 5 elevated by fresh coverage, Feb 12 back nearer baseline” pattern.

Checklist:
1) Criteria/options: Compare Feb 12 vs Feb 5 on fixed-date Trends URL; within ±3 = no change; +4 = increase; −4 = decrease.
2) Outside-view base rate used: [18, 61, 21].
3) Consistency: Most likely = Doesn’t change; least likely = Increases; yes—fits “no late catalyst” + mild decay risk.
4) Key evidence (≤20 words each):
   - Feb 3 caucus + Feb 4 Reuters bill create short-lived search bump near Feb 5.
   - Post-announcement attention typically decays without new events.
   - No clear scheduled Feb 10–12 Klobuchar event in provided info.
5) Blind spot: A major ICE confrontation/scandal or viral national clip involving Klobuchar near Feb 11–12 → “Increases.”
6) Technicalities: probabilities 0–100 integers, sum to 100.

Probabilities: [16, 55, 29]
