Analysis  

(a) Source analysis (chronological order; all 2026 unless noted)  
1. Fox News (Jan 29) – Factual report of Klobuchar gubernatorial launch; high–reliability straight news.  
2. NBC News (Jan 29) – Same event; high-quality national outlet.  
3. NPR (Jan 29) – Focus on ICE context; high-quality, factual.  
4. Valley News Live (Feb 3) – Local TV station previewing caucuses; moderate reliability, but descriptive.  
5. Star Tribune, CBS, Yahoo, Newsweek et al. (Feb 2-4) – Minnesota caucus turnout, polling, GOP attacks; all mainstream outlets, mostly factual.  
6. Reuters / U.S. News / Investing (Feb 4) – Bill on synthetic DNA co-sponsored by Klobuchar; high reliability.  
7. HuffPost French video (Feb 4) – Congressional testimony; primary-source video plus Klobuchar quote; reliable.  
8. The New Republic (Feb 3) – Movie review mentioning audience booing Klobuchar; anecdotal, weak relevance.  

Opinions appear (e.g., GOP characterisations, analyst quotes) but carry little predictive value for Google-search volume, so they are down-weighted.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Historical Google-Trends data supplied by platform: in comparable 7-12-day windows, value changes >3 points 57 % of the time; post-announcement decay common.  
Moderate evidence  
• No scheduled national TV debate, hearing, or rally for Klobuchar 5-12 Feb (agent scan, calendars).  
• Caucus night (3 Feb) and launch week produced a spike that is already tapering (typical half-life ≈4-5 days).  
• Continuing but lower-salience news hits (DNA bill, ICE testimony) could keep a trickle of coverage.  
Weak evidence  
• Unpredictable scandals/viral clips could appear (down-side or up-side).  
• Documentary review, partisan memes – anecdotal only.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution window: 7 days (Thu 5 Feb → Thu 12 Feb).  
If the window were halved (5 days), decay would be slightly less, nudging “Doesn’t change” up a few points.  
If doubled (14 days), further decay or a fresh event becomes likelier; probability mass would shift from “Doesn’t change” toward both “Decrease” (more) and “Increase” (some).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
1. Post-spike mean reversion: launch + caucuses have already peaked; search interest usually falls by ≥40 % within a week for comparable U.S-senator announcements.  
2. Lack of scheduled catalyst: no debate, no national TV appearance, no filing deadline inside the window.  
3. Continuing but lower-octane drip of stories (DNA bill, ICE hearings) should keep some floor under searches, limiting a collapse but unlikely to raise them.  
4. Historical window stats anchor “No change” near 43 %. Given points 1-3, tilt of remaining mass toward “Decrease” is warranted but must leave room for surprise bumps.  
Blind-spot: an unforeseen viral confrontation (e.g., Klobuchar vs. Tom Cotton on Senate floor) broadcast 7-8 Feb could push interest up >3 points; this possibility caps my “Decrease” confidence.

Probability calibration  
Base-rate (outside view) Incr 22 / No 43 / Decr 35  
Inside-view adjustments  –2       -8    +10  
Final distribution    Increases 20 / Doesn’t change 35 / Decreases 45  
Spread kept moderate (entropy high) to reflect Google-Trends volatility and low resolution threshold.

Checklist (abridged)  
1. Options: compare 12 Feb value to 5 Feb; >+3 → Increase; within ±3 → No change; <-3 → Decrease. ✔  
2. Outside view used 22/43/35. ✔  
3. Most likely = Decrease; least likely = Increase – consistent with decay story. ✔  
4. Key evidence: a) historical 57 % change rate, b) announcement spike already one week old, c) no scheduled events 5-12 Feb, d) minor ongoing news hits, e) Google-Trends half-life data. ✔  
5. Blind-spot: unexpected viral clash or scandal boosting searches. ✔  
6. Probabilities sum to 100. ✔  

Probabilities: [20, 35, 45]
