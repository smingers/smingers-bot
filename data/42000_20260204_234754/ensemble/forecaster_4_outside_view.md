Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Senate calendars and committee‐assignment PDFs (govinfo.gov, dated 04 Feb 2026). Purely factual rosters; no forward-looking content; high documentary reliability but almost zero relevance to short-term Google-search behaviour.  
2. Associated Press / Citizens’ Voice & KSAT articles (29 Jan 2026) on Klobuchar’s gubernatorial bid. Credible national wire reporting; factual element = launch date 29 Jan; opinions limited to quoted politicians. Establishes that a news spike already occurred.  
3. AP repeat on WDIV (same story, 29 Jan 2026) and CNN “Fast Facts” page (updated to include 29 Jan event). Same information value.  
4. Agent report (cut-off 04 Feb 2026). Synthesises public calendars, TV-booking grids, court dockets. No planned high-salience Klobuchar events for 05-12 Feb. Quality: medium; essentially an open-source scan.  
5. Google-Trends data scrape supplied by questioner. Empirical, directly germane. 90-day mean 8.9, sd 16.9; last 30-day point at 15; base-rate calculation that in past 90 days 43 % of 12-day windows ended ≤3 pts from start.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
i. All Google-Trends eight- to twelve-day windows for mid-profile U.S. senators (e.g., Durbin, Cornyn, Murray) over multiple years.  
ii. All Google-Trends eight- to twelve-day windows for any political figure following a discrete announcement peak (campaign launch, book release).  
iii. Generic “all terms” short windows in Google-Trends.

Class i captures the same scale of public interest and typical media cadence, without relying on campaign-launch idiosyncrasies that belong to an inside view. It is therefore selected for the outside-view baseline.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Time from today (04 Feb) to first measurement (05 Feb) = 1 day; window length to outcome (12 Feb) = 8 days. Empirically, eight-to-twelve-day deltas for mid-profile senators are modest:  
• Change > 3 pts occurred 57 % of the time in the 90-day sample supplied.  
• Direction was roughly even: 29 % up, 28 % down; 43 % stayed within ±3.  
Seasonal effects: none (February baseline in U.S. politics is typically quiet outside State-of-the-Union week, which already passed on 27 Jan).  

(d) Justification  
• The gubernatorial-launch spike is inside-view information and, per task, withheld from the baseline.  
• No systematic directional drift exists in the generic reference class; increases and decreases are nearly symmetrical.  
• Given 57 % historical odds of a > 3-point move and the near-even split of directions, the naïve outside-view probabilities centre on ≈29 % Increase, ≈28 % Decrease, ≈43 % No change.  
• Sampling error: ±5 pp expected on a 90-day base; to stay conservative, slightly widen the middle bucket.

Outside view calibration:

1. Anchor to historical frequencies (43 / 29 / 28).  
2. Adjust for small-sample uncertainty by shrinking toward an uninformative 1/3-1/3-1/3 prior with a weight of 20 % (standard extremising-reversal step for limited data).  
   Resulting mix = 0.8 × [0.29, 0.43, 0.28] + 0.2 × [0.33, 0.33, 0.33]  
   = [0.292, 0.41, 0.298].  
3. Round to nearest 1 %.

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 29%  
Doesn't change: 41%  
Decreases: 30%
