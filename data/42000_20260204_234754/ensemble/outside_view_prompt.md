You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “amy klobuchar” change between 2026-02-05 and 2026-02-12 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “amy klobuchar” at the time of writing this question (Feb 1, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 15; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=amy%20klobuchar&date=2026-01-02%202026-02-01).

The options are: ['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves “Doesn't change” if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=amy%20klobuchar&date=2026-01-13%202026-02-12](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=amy%20klobuchar&date=2026-01-13%202026-02-12) for 2026-02-12 is within 3 of the value at 2026-02-05. It resolves “Increases” if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves “Decreases” if the value is more than 3 lower.

# Article Summary: "Escape from Washington? Senators look to start new chapters as governors"

**Source:** Wilkes-Barre Citizens' Voice (Associated Press)  
**Date:** January 29, 2026  
**Author:** Maya Sweedler

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Amy Klobuchar** (Democrat, Minnesota) announced her gubernatorial campaign on Thursday (late January 2026), becoming the **fourth sitting senator** to seek their state's governorship in 2026
- This is the **most senators running for governor in recent history**, according to an AP analysis of congressional retirements
- The other three senators running for governor are:
  - Michael Bennet (Democrat, Colorado)
  - Marsha Blackburn (Republican, Tennessee)
  - Tommy Tuberville (Republican, Alabama)
- **Eleven senators** have announced their intent to retire next year (2027), including nine in the final year of their term
- This cycle would have the **highest Senate turnover in more than a decade**
- The last time more than a dozen senators left in one year was after the 113th Congress, when **13 senators** retired, resigned, or died
- Since 1913 (when direct election of senators began), **22 senators** have served as governors after leaving the Senate
- Of those 22, **seven moved directly** from the U.S. Senate to the governor's mansion
- Most recently, **Mike Braun of Indiana** won his state's governor's race in 2024 while serving as a senator

## Named Source Opinions:

**Tommy Tuberville (Senator, Alabama):**
- "Because I think I can do more good in that seat than I can in this one"
- Doesn't think there's a common denominator among senators running for governor
- "I think I can do more in the short term than I can in the long term up here"
- As governor, "you're CEO of the state, and your vote counts more," while in the Senate, "you're one of 100"

**Michael Bennet (Senator, Colorado):**
- There's no way to address problems like affordability from the Senate
- "Donald Trump's Washington, D.C. will never be responsive to those challenges. He's literally hanging gold on the walls of the Oval Office"
- Trump has "declared war" on Colorado
- "It's very important to have people who understand those national fights and who won't cower in the face of that"

**Matt Dallek (Political historian, George Washington University):**
- "The push factor is the Senate in particular has become a more noxious place for lawmakers, because all the downsides to serving in public office and in the Senate are no longer mitigated in a significant way by the upsides of passing legislation"
- "Being governor, aside from the obvious fact that you're chief executive as opposed to one of 100, is increasingly alluring. At the state level, a lot more can get done"
- "It's in the states — these so-called labs of democracy — where governance is possible"

## Context:

The article frames this trend as reflecting a shift in political ambition away from Washington, with the Senate becoming "increasingly stagnant and dysfunctional" while governorships offer "the ability to govern, build a record and shape a national profile."

# Summary of Article: "Klobuchar will run for Minnesota governor after Walz ends bid"

**Key Facts:**

- **Date of announcement:** January 29, 2026 (Thursday) - Sen. Amy Klobuchar announced she is running for governor of Minnesota
- **Context:** Gov. Tim Walz (2024 Democratic VP nominee) abandoned his campaign for a third term this month amid criticism over mismanagement of taxpayer funding for child care programs
- **Klobuchar's electoral record:** 
  - Currently in her fourth Senate term
  - Won 2024 reelection by nearly 16 percentage points
  - Received 135,000 more votes than Democratic presidential nominee Kamala Harris in 2024
  - Harris outpaced Trump by fewer than 5 percentage points in Minnesota
- **Political risk:** Low-risk move for Klobuchar - if she loses, she keeps her Senate seat and won't be up for reelection until 2030
- **Senate vacancy procedure:** If she wins, either she or Walz will appoint someone to fill the vacancy, depending on timing of her resignation. A special election would later be held.

**Campaign Issues Identified:**

- Trump's immigration crackdown in Minnesota
- Federal officers killing two Minnesotans (Renee Good shot three times and killed by ICE officer in early January; ICU nurse Alex Pretti fatally shot by federal officers on Saturday)
- Assassination of a state legislative leader (within past year)
- School shooting that killed multiple children (within past year)
- Federal investigation into Minnesota's child care programs and its Somali community
- Trump administration conducting multiple investigations of state officials, including Walz

**Republican Opposition:**

Klobuchar is the fourth sitting senator to announce plans to run for governor in 2026 (others in Alabama, Colorado, and Tennessee). Multiple Minnesota Republicans are campaigning:
- Mike Lindell (My Pillow founder/CEO, 2020 election denier close to Trump)
- State House Speaker Lisa Demuth
- Dr. Scott Jensen (former state senator, party's 2022 gubernatorial candidate)
- State Rep. Kristin Robbins

**Republican response:** Demuth stated Klobuchar "simply cannot deliver the change that our state needs, and would be nothing more than a third term of Tim Walz"

**Background Information:**

- Klobuchar is a former local prosecutor who positions herself as a moderate
- Ran for president in 2020 as a moderate, outlasted several better-funded candidates
- Announced in 2021 she had been treated for breast cancer; announced in 2024 she was cancer-free but undergoing another round of radiation

This is a major political development that could significantly impact search interest in Amy Klobuchar during the timeframe in question.

# Article Summary: Escape from Washington? Senators look to start new chapters as governors

2. **Other senators running for governor in 2026:**
   - Colorado Democrat Michael Bennet
   - Tennessee Republican Marsha Blackburn
   - Alabama Republican Tommy Tuberville

3. **Historical context:** Four sitting senators seeking governorships in the same cycle is the most in recent history, according to an Associated Press analysis of congressional retirements.

4. **Senate turnover numbers:**

   - 9 of those are in the final year of their term
   - This represents the highest Senate turnover in more than a decade
   - The last time more than a dozen senators left in one year was after the 113th Congress, when 13 senators retired, resigned, or died (partly due to President Barack Obama appointing senators to his administration)

5. **Historical data on senators becoming governors:** Since direct election of senators began in 1913, 22 senators have served as governors after leaving the Senate, with 7 moving directly from the U.S. Senate to the governor's mansion.

## Opinions from Named Sources:

- **Senator Tommy Tuberville (Alabama Republican):** "Because I think I can do more good in that seat than I can in this one." He also stated that as governor, "you're CEO of the state, and your vote counts more," while in the Senate, "you're one of 100."

He noted Trump has "declared war" on Colorado and emphasized the importance of having "people who understand those national fights and who won't cower in the face of that."

- **Matt Dallek (political historian at George Washington University):** Described both "push and pull factors" - the Senate has become "a more noxious place for lawmakers" where downsides are no longer mitigated by upsides of passing legislation. He stated that governorships are "increasingly alluring" because "at the state level, a lot more can get done" and "it's in the states — these so-called labs of democracy — where governance is possible."

Query: Check if any planned major announcement, TV appearance, or investigation expected for Amy Klobuchar between Feb 5-12 2026. Highlight anything that would elevate national coverage.
Based on all open-source material located to date, there is still no evidence of a fresh, calendar-certain event that would automatically propel Senator Amy Klobuchar to new national prominence in the 5–12 February 2026 window.

1.  Planned announcements  
    •  The only on-record announcement remains her 29 January 2026 declaration that she is running for Minnesota governor, which continues to drive follow-up reporting and polling but is already public (Newsweek, 31 Jan 2026). No campaign advisories, fundraising invitations, or DFL calendars retrieved since then list a second-phase “kick-off” rally, policy rollout, or endorsement reveal scheduled for 5–12 Feb.  
    •  Standard campaign practice suggests a live rally usually follows 2–3 weeks after a launch video, so one could fall into the target week, yet nothing is posted in public feeds as of 4 Feb 2026.

2.  National-TV bookings  
    •  Klobuchar last appeared on NBC’s “Meet the Press” on 25 Jan 2026 (NBC News transcript archive, 1 Feb 2026). Episode rundowns released for “Meet the Press” (NBC), “Face the Nation” (CBS), “This Week” (ABC) and “State of the Union” (CNN) for 2 Feb and 9 Feb do not mention her. Most Sunday-show guest lists are finalised by the preceding Friday; none of the networks’ media-relations sites or commercial TV-listing services show her booked for 9 Feb.  
    •  No press releases or promotional tweets from late-night, prime-time cable, or streaming political programs flag an upcoming Klobuchar segment during 5–12 Feb.

3.  Investigations or legal developments  
    •  Existing federal probes—the Feeding Our Future fraud case and the DOJ civil-rights investigation into ICE’s shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti—continue, but none list Klobuchar as a subject or witness and no procedural deadlines fall in the 5–12 Feb span (Newsweek; YouGov polling write-up).  
    •  Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Federal Courts has a 4 Feb hearing titled “Fighting Fraud in Minnesota and Beyond” (Senate committee schedule, 4 Feb 2026). Although the topic overlaps with Minnesota’s pandemic-nutrition scandal, the session occurs one day before the target window and the panel is chaired by Sen. Whitehouse, not Klobuchar. Her participation would be as a non-chair member; such appearances rarely generate front-page coverage unless a major revelation surfaces.  
    •  No new ethics complaints or FEC filings naming Klobuchar post-launch were located.

4.  Routine Senate activity  
    •  The full Judiciary Committee holds a business meeting on 5 Feb (10:15 a.m.) to mark up child-exploitation legislation (Senate committee schedule, 5 Feb 2026). Klobuchar, as a senior Democrat on the committee, is likely to attend, but these closed-press mark-ups seldom attract national airtime unless a bill sparks controversy.

5.  Campaign-trail context that could sustain—but not spike—coverage  
    •  Early DFL caucus preference ballots show overwhelming rank-and-file support (Rochester Post-Bulletin, 4 Feb 2026).  
    •  A KSTP/SurveyUSA poll released 31 Jan gives Klobuchar double-digit leads over all GOP challengers (Newsweek, 31 Jan 2026), ensuring continued horse-race stories but not tied to any new event.  
    •  Immigration remains a live backdrop: a YouGov/Economist poll fielded 30 Jan–2 Feb finds national majorities critical of ICE tactics and shows Klobuchar’s net favourability at 0 (YouGov, 3 Feb 2026). Reporters may use those data during the week, yet they are reactive analyses, not scheduled announcements.

6.  Net assessment for 5–12 February 2026  
    •  No planned major announcement, nationally broadcast television appearance, or investigative milestone involving Klobuchar is confirmed for that period.  
    •  The most plausible “elevators” of coverage would be:  
        –  An unannounced first large-scale campaign rally if the campaign chooses that week;  
        –  A late booking on a Sunday show for 9 Feb should immigration funding or DHS appropriations negotiations reach a flash-point;  
        –  Unexpected revelations at the 4 Feb Senate fraud hearing or new indictments in the Feeding Our Future case, either of which could generate follow-on stories during 5–12 Feb.  None of these are presently scheduled.

Remaining information gaps & recommended monitoring  
    1.  Re-check network guest advisories on 7–8 Feb for last-minute Sunday-show additions.  
    2.  Watch Klobuchar’s official Senate and campaign social-media feeds daily for rally or town-hall notices.  
    3.  Track U.S. Attorney press releases in Minnesota for any charging documents tied to the fraud probe, as they tend to drop mid-week.  
    4.  Review Senate Judiciary press releases on 6 Feb for any follow-up statements stemming from the 4 Feb subcommittee hearing.

With the information presently available, expectations for a nationally galvanising Klobuchar moment between 5 and 12 February 2026 should remain low.</Agent_report>

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
