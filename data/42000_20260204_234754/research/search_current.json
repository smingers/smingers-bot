This occurred before two U.S. citizens were killed by federal agents in Minneapolis.\n\n4. **Shooting Deaths**: Two U.S. citizens, Renee Macklin Good and Alex Pretti, were killed by federal agents in Minneapolis. These deaths have brought significant awareness to how President Trump's immigration policies are being enforced.\n\n5. **Republican Response**: Chris Madel, a Republican running for governor, ended his gubernatorial campaign, calling what's happening in the Twin Cities and across the state \"an unmitigated disaster.\"\n\n6. **Tom Homan's Involvement**: Border czar Tom Homan arrived in Minnesota this week after a phone call between President Trump and Governor Walz. He replaced Gregory Bovino (Border Patrol) who had been the face of the federal surge. Homan held a press conference in Minneapolis on January 29, 2026.\n\n7. **Drawdown Plans**: Homan stated that staff from CBP and ICE are working on a drawdown plan, dependent on cooperation from Minnesota officials and remaining targets. However, the article notes there is \"no real evidence on the streets of de-escalation.\"\n\n8. **Ongoing ICE Activity**: As recently as the day before the article (January 28, 2026), ICE agents allegedly attempted to enter the Ecuadorian consulate without a warrant, according to Democratic state Senator Doron Clark.\n\n9. **Minneapolis Mayor's Response**: Mayor Jacob Frey responded to Homan's press conference, maintaining his position that \"Operation Metro Surge must end\" (referring to the ramped-up ICE presence in Minnesota since early December).\n\n10. **Maine Connection**: Maine has also seen increased ICE enforcement. Republican U.S. Senator Susan Collins reported that DHS told her enhanced operations there have ended.\n\n11. **Political Impact**: The article suggests the ICE presence \"seems to be helping Democrats\" and that \"political arguments over ICE's presence here in Minnesota and the death of two U.S. citizens at the hands of federal agents is not helping\" Republicans.\n\n12. **Trump's Focus**: President Trump held a rally in suburban Des Moines, Iowa earlier in the week (before January 29), spending the majority of his speech talking about the economy, attempting to shift focus away from ICE enforcement issues ahead of midterm elections.\n\n## Analysis from Named Sources:\n\n- **Clay Masters (Minnesota Public Radio reporter)**: Notes that voters have short attention spans despite the current high awareness of the killings. Observes that Democrats \"really haven't had a lot of power to do anything about ICE's presence in the state other than, you know, condemn it publicly.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://spectrumlocalnews.com/tx/south-texas-el-paso/morning-briefing/2026/02/02/morning-briefing-texas-feb--3\">\n# Summary of Article: Morning Briefing Texas Feb. 3\n\n**Publication:** Spectrum Local News  \n**Date:** February 3, 2026\n\n## Key Content Relevant to Amy Klobuchar:\n\nNone.

Amy Klobuchar enters governors race in Minnesota**\nU.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar announced her candidacy for Governor of Minnesota on February 4, 2026, following Governor Tim Walz\u2019s decision to step down from seeking a third term. Her entry into the race comes amid political upheaval, heightened tensions, and a series of violent incidents, including the fatal shootings of Renee Good and Alex Pretti by federal agents in Minneapolis, which sparked protests and scrutiny of immigration enforcement. Klobuchar, a four-term senator first elected in 2006 and former Hennepin County attorney, has criticized federal immigration operations, calling ICE\u2019s actions 'making us less safe' and 'deeply troubling.' She cited recent tragedies\u2014including a mass shooting at a Minneapolis-area church and the assassination of former state House Speaker Melissa Hortman and her husband\u2014as reasons for her campaign. Klobuchar pledged to combat fraud in state programs, particularly the Feeding Our Future child care and nonprofit scandal, vowing to hold 'the people who steal taxpayer money go to jail' and to overhaul state systems. She enters the race as the dominant Democratic contender, with no major rivals announced, and would become Minnesota\u2019s first female governor if elected. Her Senate departure would allow the sitting governor to appoint a temporary replacement until a special election. The Republican primary is competitive, featuring candidates including Scott Jensen, Mike Lindell, Lisa Demuth, Kristin Robbins, and Kendall Qualls, despite Minnesota not having elected a Republican governor in nearly two decades. The race is expected to be highly contested amid statewide instability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 10:56 PM\nSource:[kbzn.com](https://www.kbzn.com/2026/01/30/sen-amy-klobuchar-enters-governors-race-in-minnesota/)\n\n**Heartbreaking Testimony of Minneapolis Resident Detained by ICE**\nAliya Rahman, a Bangladeshi-American resident of south Minneapolis and an autistic individual with a traumatic brain injury, testified before U.S. lawmakers on February 3, 2026, at a Democratic-organized forum about her traumatic detention by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents on January 13, 2026. While en route to a specialized medical center, she was stopped in a traffic jam caused by ICE operations. Rahman described being shouted at with a threat to 'break your damn window' and having her passenger-side window shattered, with glass flying into her face. She claims she identified herself as disabled, but was ignored and forcibly removed from her vehicle using a knife to cut her seatbelt. She was then pinned to the ground, not informed of her arrest, and not asked for identification or told of any offense. In a detention center, she reported seeing chained Black and brown individuals referred to as 'bodies'\u2014a term she said instilled fear of not surviving. She was denied her cane, refused medical care and legal access, and was left in an interrogation room until she lost consciousness. A fellow detainee called for an ambulance. Rahman woke up in a hospital with injuries from the assault. She emphasized that 'I do not deserve less humane treatment than anyone else, citizen or not,' and criticized the lack of rules and accountability for law enforcement actions. Senator Amy Klobuchar praised her courage, stating her testimony highlights the fear felt by many Minnesotans and why ICE should leave the state. The testimony comes amid heightened tensions over ICE practices, including recent deadly shootings in Minneapolis and a congressional budget standoff, with Democrats demanding reforms such as body cameras, bans on face concealment, and judicial warrants for arrests.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 08:51 PM\nSource:[Le Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/international/video/autiste-et-handicapee-cette-americaine-raconte-sa-detention-par-l-ice-devant-les-elus-du-congres_260037.html)\n\n**US lawmakers introduce bill to screen sales of potentially dangerous synthetic DNA By Reuters**\nTwo U.S. senators, Republican Tom Cotton and Democrat Amy Klobuchar, introduced a bill on February 4, 2026, aimed at regulating the sale of synthetic DNA sequences that could be used to create bioweapons. The bill mandates the U.S. Department of Commerce, in coordination with other federal agencies, to develop a list of potentially dangerous genetic sequences and require laboratories conducting gene synthesis to screen customers and orders to prevent misuse. According to Klobuchar, the bill addresses safety risks in biotechnology, noting that while access to genetic material enables medical research, gene therapies, and crop development, the absence of safety standards could allow misuse, including bioweapon creation. Cotton emphasized that American biotech innovations must not fall into the hands of bad actors or be hindered by outdated policies. The legislation also seeks to consolidate fragmented biosecurity regulations across federal agencies to keep pace with rapid technological advancements. This follows prior legislative attention, including a 2025 House committee letter to the FBI and national intelligence regarding GenScript Biotechnology\u2019s ties to China, and a bipartisan proposal to require export licenses for gene sequence data sent to China.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 10:14 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/us-lawmakers-introduce-bill-to-screen-sales-of-potentially-dangerous-synthetic-dna-4483968)\n\n**Amy Klobuchar Announces Candidacy for Minnesota Governor to Succeed Tim Walz**\nAmy Klobuchar, a 19-year veteran Democratic U.S. Senator from Minnesota, announced her candidacy for governor of Minnesota, seeking to succeed outgoing Governor Tim Walz. Klobuchar, who graduated magna cum laude from Yale Law School and served as Hennepin County Attorney from 1999 to 2006, became Minnesota\u2019s first female U.S. Senator in 2007. She is currently serving her term until 2031 and would suspend it if elected governor. In her announcement on X (formerly Twitter), she emphasized the need for courage, resilience, and faith in one another, stating, 'Today I announce my candidacy for governor.' Her platform highlights infrastructure, economic development, and bipartisan legislation\u2014she is recognized as the Senate member who introduced the most bipartisan bills between 2021 and 2023. According to a CBS News analysis, Klobuchar is a strong Democratic contender in a state where Republicans aim to win a governorship for the first time since 2006. She consistently ranks as Minnesota\u2019s top vote-getter across elections, receiving approximately 135,000 more votes than Kamala Harris in 2024. The general election is scheduled for November 3, 2026, with the primary on August 11, 2026, following Walz\u2019s decision not to seek re-election amid a social program fraud investigation.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 08:00 AM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/estados-unidos/adios-tim-walz-quien-es-amy-klobuchar-la-candidata-a-gobernadora-que-quiere-reemplazarlo-en-nid04022026/)\n\n**Thousands of Minnesota Democrats turn out on caucus night**\nOn February 3, 2026, tens of thousands of Minnesota Democrats participated in precinct caucuses, signaling a strong grassroots mobilization driven by opposition to the Trump administration, local Republican allies, and the recent deployment of 3,000 federal immigration agents. In south Minneapolis, particularly in Ward 10\u2014a left-leaning area\u2014many attendees voted 'uncommitted' in a straw poll for governor, despite Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar being the sole major DFL candidate after Gov. Tim Walz withdrew from the race. In the Whittier neighborhood precinct, 30 of 50 voters chose 'uncommitted,' seven backed Klobuchar, and the rest voted for non-candidate options. In the Wedge neighborhood, 70 out of 89 voters selected 'uncommitted' and 19 supported Klobuchar. Meghan Casey, a precinct chair, criticized Klobuchar for her past role as Hennepin County Attorney, citing her 'tough-on-crime' record and lack of 'atonement for past harms,' calling her a 'centrist' unsuitable for the current progressive DFL base. Klobuchar, who has served in the U.S. Senate for 19 years and supported bipartisan judicial confirmations and Trump\u2019s 2025 inauguration, faces challenges in connecting with younger, more diverse, and urban DFL voters. Attendees also heard two-minute campaign pitches from Attorney General Keith Ellison and Rep. Aisha Gomez. Ellison urged caucus-goers to endorse him 'one last time' to continue defending Minnesotans against the Trump administration, stating, 'We cannot let (Trump) tell the rest of the country, 'I made Minnesota bow, and I'll make you bow too.'' The precinct caucuses also passed resolutions to abolish U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), defund the Department of Homeland Security, and ensure access to gender-affirming care. Suburban turnout was strong, with over 1,000 attendees at the Eagan DFL caucus.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 05:32 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/thousands-minnesota-democrats-turn-caucus-053228349.html)\n\n**US Lawmakers Introduce Bill to Screen Sales of Potentially Dangerous Synthetic DNA**\nTwo U.S. senators, Republican Tom Cotton and Democrat Amy Klobuchar, introduced a bill on February 4, 2026, aimed at regulating the sale of synthetic DNA sequences that could be used to create bioweapons.

Synthetic genes, which are lab-created nucleic acid sequences used in medical research, gene therapies, and agriculture, have become increasingly accessible due to advancements in artificial intelligence and benchtop synthesis machines. Klobuchar emphasized that while access to genetic material enables vital scientific progress, the absence of safety standards risks misuse for bioweapon development. Cotton stressed that American biotechnology innovation must be protected from falling into the hands of bad actors or being hindered by outdated regulations. The legislation also seeks to consolidate fragmented biosecurity rules across federal agencies, streamline oversight, and address safety gaps in response to rapidly evolving technology.

Klobuchar leads former state Senator Scott Jensen by 14 points (49% to 35%), with other Republicans trailing further behind. The race has shifted significantly due to heightened immigration enforcement under the Trump administration, which deployed 3,000 border patrol agents to Minnesota amid a $250 million to $1 billion fraud scandal involving the nonprofit Feeding Our Future. The scandal, which involved fraudulent claims for child nutrition programs and led to dozens of indictments\u2014including members of the Somali community\u2014damaged Governor Tim Walz\u2019s reputation, prompting him to forgo a third term. Republicans initially had momentum, but the federal immigration crackdown, including fatal shootings of two U.S. citizens by federal agents and controversial tactics like using a 5-year-old as bait, has sparked backlash, shifting focus from fraud to immigration. Political analyst Larry Jacobs stated the issue has 'incinerated' fraud as a top concern, transforming the race from leaning Democratic to 'almost a lock' for Democrats. Klobuchar, who has represented Minnesota in the Senate for nearly two decades, launched her campaign on January 29, 2026, emphasizing resilience and accountability. Republican candidates, including MMA fighter Brad Kohler and Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, criticized Klobuchar as a career politician disconnected from voters\u2019 needs. GOP Chair Alex Plecash accused her of endorsing Walz\u2019s record of educational decline, tax hikes, and unchecked fraud. Despite these attacks, forecasters rate the race as Likely Democratic (Cook Political Report, Sabato\u2019s Crystal Ball), and Kalshi\u2019s betting odds give Democrats an 89% chance of victory. The primary is scheduled for August 11, 2026, with the general election on November 3.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 04:05 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/republicans-chances-of-beating-amy-klobuchar-to-flip-minnesota-poll-11458932)\n\n**Beneath the Stifling Boredom of Melania**\nThe article reviews the documentary 'Melania,' directed and co-produced by Brett Ratner and featuring First Lady Melania Trump, released on February 3, 2026. The film captures Melania Trump in the 20 days leading up to her husband Donald J. Trump\u2019s second inauguration. Despite widespread rumors of poor ticket sales\u2014evidenced by unsold seat maps and GOP clubs struggling to distribute purchased tickets\u2014the film earned over $7 million in its opening weekend, an unusually strong result for a documentary. The author attended a matinee screening in a New Jersey suburban multiplex, describing the audience as predominantly older, ideologically loyal Trump supporters who applauded when Donald Trump appeared on screen and reacted with hostility to political figures like Senator Amy Klobuchar. The author characterizes the film as 'punishingly dull' and 'occasionally absurd,' suggesting it appeals more to partisan audiences than to general viewers. The article notes the irony of a film directed by Brett Ratner, who was exiled from Hollywood in 2017 over sexual assault allegations he denies, being marketed as a major release despite its controversial pedigree.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 11:33 AM\nSource:[The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/article/205808/beneath-stifling-boredom-melania-documentary-review)\n\n**ICE raids, protests at top of mind ahead of Minnesota party caucuses**\nThe mid-term election season in Minnesota began with party caucuses on Tuesday, 2026, amid heightened concerns over U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) raids and protests. Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, and businessman Kendall Qualls are the top GOP candidates in straw polls ahead of the caucuses. GOP Party Chair Alex Plechash expressed concern about anti-ICE protests, while Republicans emphasized voter fraud as a key motivator for turnout. The DFL, meanwhile, is worried that fear of ICE could suppress participation, prompting the party to deploy 6,500 trained constitutional volunteers, attorneys, a legal hotline, translators, and security at caucus sites. DFL Chair Richard Carlbom stated, 'I'm very angry that Donald Trump is making it so that people are afraid to leave their homes and they cannot participate,' adding that some fear 'they could be disappeared by ICE agents.' The DFL governor\u2019s race features Sen. Amy Klobuchar and one little-known challenger, Christopher Seymore, while the GOP race includes 13 candidates, with analysts noting that strong performance in the straw poll can lead to endorsements, funding, and campaign momentum.

These caucuses allow party members to select delegates for upcoming conventions, influence party platforms, and express views on key issues. The Republican Party is facing a competitive gubernatorial race with at least 12 candidates, including Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, MyPillow CEO Mike Lindell, businessman Kendall Qualls, state Rep.

Amy Klobuchar as its sole major declared candidate for governor. In addition to the governor\u2019s race, all 201 legislative seats, the offices of secretary of state, attorney general, and state auditor will be contested in November. DFL participants must reside in the precinct, identify with DFL principles, and not be active members of another political party. The caucuses are taking place amid heightened scrutiny of federal immigration enforcement, government program fraud, and Gov. Walz\u2019s withdrawal from the 2024 presidential race.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 09:00 PM\nSource:[Star Tribune](https://www.startribune.com/mn-precinct-caucus-dfl-gop-election/601573223)\n\n**Why Sen. Klobuchar is seen as a formidable governor candidate**\nU.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar has entered the race for Minnesota governor, positioning herself as a strong candidate due to her broad appeal across party lines, particularly among Republican voters. With no major opposition within the DFL party, she is seen as a likely nominee following Governor Tim Walz's decision not to seek a third term. Former Republican Governor Arne Carlson praised her as a 'game-changer,' comparing her to legendary athlete Kirby Puckett. However, Republican candidates, including Minnesota House Speaker Lisa Demuth, have criticized Klobuchar for her long-standing support of Walz and her perceived inaction on fraud scandals in Minnesota\u2019s welfare programs. Demuth released a new ad on January 29, 2026, highlighting Klobuchar\u2019s comment during Walz\u2019s 2024 vice presidential campaign: 'We love a dad in plaid.' Despite this, polling data consistently shows strong approval of Klobuchar\u2019s performance in the U.S. Senate, with voters citing her ability to pass legislation in a divided Congress and work across party lines.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 12:00 PM\nSource:[Star Tribune](https://www.startribune.com/why-democrats-see-amy-klobuchar-as-such-a-formidable-candidate-for-governor/601559650)\n\n**Senator Klobuchar taking first step in running for Governor - Fox21Online**\nSenator Amy Klobuchar has filed with the Minnesota Campaign Finance Board on January 22, 2026, to form a campaign committee for a potential run for Minnesota Governor, marking the first formal step toward a gubernatorial campaign. Although this filing does not officially confirm her candidacy, it is widely interpreted as an initial move in her campaign strategy. Klobuchar, 65, was first elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006 and previously served as Hennepin County Attorney. She has won all four of her statewide general elections with at least 56% of the vote. Her potential run follows Minnesota Governor Tim Walz\u2019s announcement on September 22, 2025, that he would not seek reelection due to insufficient energy to campaign, which triggered immediate speculation about Klobuchar\u2019s interest in the office.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 10:58 PM\nSource:[Fox21Online](https://www.fox21online.com/2026/01/22/senator-klobuchar-taking-first-step-in-running-for-governor/)\n\n**Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar files paperwork to run for Minnesota governor, inching closer to announcement**\nDemocratic U.S. Senator Amy Klobuchar filed paperwork on January 22, 2026, to establish a campaign committee for a potential run for Minnesota governor, signaling she is nearing an official announcement. A source close to the senator stated the filing is a preliminary step required for any candidate considering a run, and that Klobuchar will announce her plans in the coming days. Klobuchar, widely regarded as the most popular Democrat in Minnesota, could help avoid a contentious primary to succeed Governor Tim Walz, who suspended his reelection campaign amid federal pressure due to a welfare fraud investigation. Walz cited his inability to fully focus on a campaign while defending Minnesota against allegations, which stem from a federal agent's fatal shooting of Renee Good and threats by President Donald Trump to invoke the Insurrection Act. The Justice Department has opened investigations into Walz and Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey over alleged obstruction of federal law enforcement, with Frey calling the probe 'deeply concerning' and Walz labeling it 'political theater.' Klobuchar, who won reelection to the Senate in 2024 and is considered a potential 2028 presidential candidate, is also seen as a likely frontrunner for the Democratic nomination if she runs. One county party chair said she would likely secure the nomination, while another questioned the strategic sense of her run given her potential role as Senate Majority Leader if Democrats regain control of the Senate. Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison confirmed he would not run for governor.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 09:56 PM\nSource:[ABC News](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/democratic-sen-amy-klobuchar-files-paperwork-run-minnesota/story?id=129466492)\n\n**Sen. Amy Klobuchar prepares to run for Minnesota governor**\nSenator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota has filed paperwork to form a campaign committee for a potential run for governor, marking a preliminary step toward a possible bid. This move comes after Governor Tim Walz dropped his reelection campaign amid a federal investigation into a widespread welfare fraud scandal, intensified by the Trump administration's aggressive immigration crackdown in Minnesota. The state has become a political flashpoint following the January 7 shooting of Renee Good, a 37-year-old mother of three, which prompted Klobuchar to call for a thorough, impartial investigation into the incident. Klobuchar, 65, has long been a popular figure in Minnesota, winning four Senate races with decisive margins, including a 16-point victory in 2024. She is not expected to resign her Senate seat immediately, joining Republican Sens. Marsha Blackburn and Tommy Tuberville in running for governor while serving in the Senate. If elected in November 2026, she could resign and allow Walz to appoint her successor or choose her own replacement after taking office in January 2027. If she loses, she could return to the Senate. Her potential candidacy would likely clear the Democratic field, while Republican candidates remain uncertain. The political landscape is further complicated by a $10 billion freeze on social service and childcare funding in Minnesota and four other Democratic-led states, along with the deployment of 2,000 federal immigration agents. The fraud scandal involves over 90 charged individuals, many of Somali descent, and has sparked national debate. Minnesota\u2019s unique blend of deep-blue liberalism and deep-red conservatism, coupled with a declining split-ticket voting trend, makes it a pivotal battleground. Klobuchar has positioned herself as a pragmatic, moderate candidate capable of winning in both red and purple districts, a strategy that defined her 2020 presidential bid. She remains undecided but has expressed deep affection for her state and her Senate role. According to a Minnesota Star Tribune analysis, only 12 counties in 2024 saw split-ticket voting, down from 57 in 2012, signaling a shift toward partisan polarization. In the 2024 general election, Klobuchar received 1,792,441 votes\u2014135,462 more than Kamala Harris and 273,409 more than Trump.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 07:56 PM\nSource:[ABC17NEWS](https://abc17news.com/politics/national-politics/cnn-us-politics/2026/01/22/sen-amy-klobuchar-prepares-to-run-for-minnesota-governor/)\n\n**Reports: Sen.

The filing is described as a necessary preliminary step for any candidate considering a campaign. The source confirmed that Klobuchar will announce her intentions in the coming days. This move follows Gov. Tim Walz's withdrawal from the 2026 race and comes shortly after Attorney General Keith Ellison ruled out a gubernatorial bid. The field includes more than a dozen Republicans, such as Mike Lindell, Lisa Demuth, Kristin Robbins, Peggy Bennett, Chris Madel, Kendall Qualls, and Scott Jensen, as well as one third-party candidate, Mike Newcome of the Forward Independence Party. Candidates have until June 2026 to file, with the primary scheduled for August 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 07:04 PM\nSource:[Brainerd Dispatch](https://www.brainerddispatch.com/news/minnesota/sen-amy-klobuchar-filing-paperwork-to-run-for-minnesota-governor-source-says)\n\n**Sen.

Walz met with Klobuchar on January 4, 2026, before announcing his withdrawal the next day, according to multiple sources familiar with the meeting. The potential move comes amid speculation about Klobuchar\u2019s political future after Walz\u2019s exit from the race.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 05, 2026 03:29 PM\nSource:[The Brunswick News](https://thebrunswicknews.com/news/national_news/sen-amy-klobuchar-may-run-for-minnesota-gover/article_1167d631-f8ed-5ffb-ac59-6f3d7a5d2039.html)\n\n**MAGA Roasts Dem Senator for Accidentally 'Dunking on Biden' as Trump Dig Backfires**\nSenator Amy Klobuchar (D-MN) posted a graph on X (formerly Twitter) showing a 32% increase in average household energy arrears, from $597 in 2022 to $789 in 2025, to argue that energy prices rose 11% under Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. The graph, sourced from The Century Foundation, was used to urge that 'American families deserve better.' However, MAGA supporters and conservative pundits, including Scott Jennings of CNN, criticized her for inadvertently highlighting a trend that began during Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, with a community note on her post clarifying that Biden was president from January 20, 2021, to January 20, 2025, and that the chart reflects past-due balances, not electricity costs directly. Despite this, the same report noted that residential electricity prices rose 10.5% between January and August 2025\u2014among the fastest increases in a decade\u2014driven by high interest rates, expensive natural gas, and surging demand from data centers. The broader context reveals that rising arrears are part of a deeper cost-of-living crisis, a concern increasingly attributed to the Trump administration by conservative voters, according to recent polls.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 01:36 PM\nSource:[Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/maga-roasts-dem-senator-for-accidentally-dunking-on-biden-as-trump-dig-backfires/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
