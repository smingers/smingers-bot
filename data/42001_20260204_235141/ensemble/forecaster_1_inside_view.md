Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Yahoo Finance (Jan 13, 2026)**: Reports Omar's financial disclosure showed assets of $6M-$30M tied to husband's businesses (ESTCRU LLC winery and Rose Lake Capital VC firm), up from ~$15K-$51K previously. **Factual**: Disclosure figures are verifiable public records. **Opinion**: Omar calling allegations "ridiculous" and "categorically false." Quality: HIGH for financial data. Date: Recent, within disclosure cycle.

**KATV/The National Desk (Jan 27, 2026)**: Provides context on congressional disclosure rules and comparative wealth analysis (Pelosi's trajectory). **Factual**: Disclosure ranges, congressional salary ($174K), DOJ/House investigations confirmed. **Opinion**: Brennan Center's commentary on conflicts of interest. Quality: HIGH for procedural context. Date: Recent.

**Newsweek (date unclear, likely late Jan 2026)**: Comprehensive summary of wealth increase, fraud scandal context, and political attacks. **Factual**: Disclosure figures, MEALS Act history, fraud convictions. **Opinion**: NLPC's Kamenar calling situation "strange," MAGA commentators' accusations. Quality: MODERATE - mixes facts with partisan commentary. Expert opinions are from advocacy groups, not neutral analysts.

**Fox News (Jan 26, 2026)**: Emphasizes dramatic asset valuation changes with visual chart. **Factual**: Specific disclosure comparisons. **Opinion**: Trump's $44M claim and DOJ investigation call. Quality: MODERATE - reliable for factual data but conservative-leaning framing. Date: Recent.

**Quiver Quantitative (Jan 29, 2026)**: Reports Q4 2025 fundraising ($1.1M) and estimates net worth at $18.1M. **Factual**: FEC filing data. **Opinion/Estimate**: Net worth calculation is proprietary estimate with disclaimer about potential inaccuracy. Quality: MODERATE - transparent methodology but acknowledges limitations.

**AskNews Articles (Feb 2-4, 2026)**: Multiple sources covering Trump's escalating attacks (ISIS insinuation, deportation calls, fraud accusations), OMAR Act introduction, and fact-checking articles. **Factual**: Trump's Truth Social posts, Comer's subpoena plans, OMAR Act introduction, Snopes fact-check findings. **Opinion**: Trump's characterizations, partisan framings. Quality: MIXED - ranges from HIGH (Snopes, established outlets) to PARTISAN (Breitbart, Western Journal). Dates: Very recent (within 48 hours of question opening).

**Key Pattern**: The news cycle shows distinct phases:
- Mid-Jan: Initial disclosure revelations
- Late Jan (25-29): Peak coverage around town hall incident
- Early Feb (2-4): Political escalation (Trump attacks, OMAR Act) and fact-checking

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Google Trends historical pattern (Agent Report)**: Shows 80% of 12-day windows have >3 point changes, establishing "Doesn't change" base rate at ~20%. Multiple spike-decay cycles documented with clear news catalysts. This is structural evidence about search behavior volatility.

2. **Current trajectory data**: Value crashed from 100 (Jan 29) to 9 (Feb 4) - a 91-point decline in 6 days. 7-day averages show 54.1 → 20.0 decline. This represents strong downward momentum with clear causal mechanism (post-scandal decay).

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Recent news catalysts (Feb 2-4)**: Trump's ISIS insinuation post (Feb 3), OMAR Act introduction (Feb 2), Breitbart/Western Journal coverage (Feb 2) represent fresh developments. However, these are political attacks rather than new factual revelations about finances. Could generate 4-8 point search interest bump but unlikely to match Jan 29 peak.

2. **Floor effect consideration**: Current value of 9 is 58% below 90-day mean (21.5) and near historical lows. Limited downside room (can't go below 0), but also suggests stabilization possibility in 5-12 range.

3. **Scheduled events**: Possible FEC Q4 filing release (Feb 6-8) and Milwaukee speech (Feb 8). FEC filings rarely drive Google Trends unless shocking; speech is regional. Weak catalysts for "Increases."

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Ongoing investigations**: DOJ and House investigations are background factors but no resolution timeline announced. Unlikely to drive daily search interest unless new development surfaces.

2. **OMAR Act**: Legislative introduction (Feb 2) is symbolic but bills rarely drive sustained search interest without floor votes or passage.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 10 days (Feb 5-14)
**Current position**: 6 days post-peak, in rapid decay phase

**If timeframe halved to 5 days (Feb 5-9)**: Would increase "Decreases" probability to ~65% as insufficient time for mean reversion or new catalysts. "Doesn't change" would drop to ~15%.

**If timeframe doubled to 20 days (Feb 5-24)**: Would increase "Increases" probability to ~35% as more time for scheduled events (FEC filing, potential Comer subpoena) to materialize. "Decreases" would drop to ~40% as mean reversion becomes more likely over longer period.

**Critical dates within window**:
- Feb 6-8: Possible FEC Q4 filing release
- Feb 8: Milwaukee speech
- Feb 10-14: No known scheduled events

The 10-day window is long enough for a catalyst to emerge but short enough that current downward momentum matters significantly.

## (d) Justification

**Base rate starting point**: 
- Doesn't change: 20% (from 80% historical >3 point change rate)
- Increases vs Decreases: Should split remaining 80%

**Factors shifting toward "Decreases" (from 40% base to 50-55%)**:
1. **Strong downward momentum**: 91-point drop in 6 days represents extreme decay velocity. Post-visual-scandal patterns typically show continued decline for 7-14 days.
2. **News cycle moved on**: Latest coverage (Feb 2-4) is political attacks and fact-checking, not new financial revelations. These generate less search interest than scandal discovery.
3. **Below-mean current value**: At 9, already 58% below 90-day mean, suggesting decay phase is advanced.

**Factors shifting toward "Increases" (from 40% base to 25-30%)**:
1. **Recent fresh catalysts**: Trump's ISIS post (Feb 3), OMAR Act (Feb 2) are within 48 hours. Could drive 4-8 point bump if amplified.
2. **Possible FEC filing**: If released Feb 6-8 and contains new information, could spark brief interest spike.
3. **Mean reversion possibility**: Value of 9 is unusually low; historical volatility (std dev 26.3) suggests rebounds occur.

**Factors affecting "Doesn't change" (maintaining ~20-25% base)**:
1. **Floor effect**: From such low base (9), stabilization in 6-12 range is plausible, keeping within ±3 points.
2. **Historical base rate**: 20% of windows show ≤3 point change, though current momentum suggests this window is not typical.

**Critical uncertainty**: Whether Feb 2-4 news represents a minor bounce (9→15→9 pattern) or sustained new interest (9→20+ pattern). The fact that current value is 9 (per question background, Feb 1 value was 18, suggesting already declining from that mini-spike) indicates the former.

**Calibration decision**: 
- The strong downward momentum and advanced decay phase justify shifting significantly toward "Decreases"
- Recent catalysts are weaker than Jan 25-29 drivers, limiting "Increases" potential
- Floor effects and base rate support maintaining "Doesn't change" near 20%

However, I'm concerned about **overconfidence in "Decreases"** given:
1. Current value already very low (limited downside)
2. Recent news activity could sustain interest in 8-15 range
3. 10-day window allows time for unexpected catalyst

Adjusting for these uncertainties:

Probability calibration:

**Initial distribution based on outside view**:
- Decreases: 40% (half of 80% base for change)
- Doesn't change: 20% (base rate)
- Increases: 40% (half of 80% base for change)

**After inside view adjustments**:

**Decreases**: Shift from 40% → 48%
- Strong momentum justifies +8% shift
- But constrained by floor effects and advanced decay

**Doesn't change**: Shift from 20% → 27%
- Floor effects and stabilization possibility justify +7% shift
- Current value of 9 could easily stay in 6-12 range over 10 days

**Increases**: Shift from 40% → 25%
- Recent catalysts are weaker than previous spikes, justify -15% shift
- Possible FEC filing prevents dropping below 25%

**Final calibration check**: 
- 48% Decreases reflects strong but not overwhelming confidence given floor effects
- 27% Doesn't change is above base rate due to low starting value
- 25% Increases accounts for fresh catalysts and mean reversion possibility

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Question asks if Google Trends value for "ilhan omar net worth" on Feb 14 will be >3 points different from Feb 5 value (±3 = no change). Current value ~9, in post-peak decay.

2. **Base rate**: 80% historical change rate (>3 points), 20% no change. Final prediction maintains this 80/20 split between change/no-change categories while allocating change probability based on momentum.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = Decreases (48%); Least likely = Increases (25%). Makes sense given strong downward momentum from peak but floor effects limiting further decline.

4. **Key evidence**: (1) 91-point drop in 6 days = extreme decay velocity; (2) Current value 9 vs mean 21.5 = already below average; (3) Recent catalysts (Trump posts, OMAR Act) weaker than Jan scandal drivers; (4) 80% base rate for >3 point change; (5) Floor effect at value ~9 limits downside.

5. **Blind spot**: If Comer issues surprise subpoena Feb 6-10 or FEC filing contains shocking new information, could drive 10-20 point spike, making "Increases" correct. This would occur if I'm underestimating catalyst potential. Alternatively, if value stabilizes at 8-11 throughout window, "Doesn't change" would win.

6. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.
