Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:

**New York Post (Jan 26, 2026)**: Reports DOJ and Congressional investigations into Omar's net worth, citing Trump's claims of $44M wealth and Comer's subpoena plans. Factual elements include specific financial disclosure figures (Rose Lake Capital: $42.44 in 2022 vs up to $25M in 2024 disclosures). Quality: Mainstream outlet but known conservative lean. Trump's $44M claim is opinion/speculation; Comer's investigation statement is factual.

**Yahoo Finance (Jan 13, 2026)**: Provides detailed financial disclosure comparison showing ESTCRU LLC jumped from $15K-$50K to $1M-$5M, and Rose Lake Capital from $1-$1K to $5M-$25M between 2023-2024 filings. Quality: High for financial data. Omar's denial is her opinion; the disclosure figures are factual.

**Fox News (Jan 26, 2026)**: Similar financial data as Yahoo, emphasizing the dramatic increase. Quality: Mainstream but conservative-leaning. Trump's investigation announcement is factual; his $44M claim is speculative.

**Snopes (Feb 1, 2026)**: Debunks false claim about Omar's attacker being on her payroll. Notes NYT reported previous DOJ investigation "stalled for lack of evidence." Quality: High for fact-checking. Relevant for understanding the Jan 27 liquid-throwing incident that drove peak search interest.

**KMPH (Jan 27, 2026)**: Reports Trump and Emmer statements about investigations. Quality: Regional outlet reporting national story. Includes Omar's response that investigations "have found nothing."

**The National Desk (Feb 4, 2026)**: Provides context on congressional wealth disclosure rules and compares to Pelosi's wealth trajectory. Quality: Good for procedural context.

**Agent Report**: Identifies five distinct Google Trends spikes with associated news drivers:
- Jan 13 (index ~12): Yahoo Finance explainer
- Jan 17 (index ~28): Comer subpoena announcement
- Jan 25-26 (index ~55): Fox News articles on wealth increase
- Jan 28-29 (index 100): Town hall liquid-throwing incident
- Feb 4 (index ~22): Fact-check cluster

Quality: Excellent synthesis of spike patterns and news correlation.

**Google Trends Data**: Shows current value of 9 (as of Feb 4), 90-day mean of 21.5, recent declining trend (last 7 days avg: 20.0 vs prior 7 days: 54.1). Critical finding: In 80% of 12-day windows, value changed by >3 points.

(b) Reference Class Analysis:

**Reference Class 1: Post-peak decay patterns for political scandal searches**
Suitability: HIGH. The Jan 29 peak (100) was driven by a dramatic visual event (liquid-throwing). Such peaks typically show rapid decay as novelty fades. Current value (9) is 91% below peak, suggesting strong momentum downward.

**Reference Class 2: Recurring political investigation stories**
Suitability: MEDIUM. Financial investigation stories can have multiple waves, but the agent report shows each spike required a distinct news catalyst. No major catalysts are scheduled Feb 5-14 except possible FEC filing (Feb 6-8) and Milwaukee speech (Feb 8).

**Reference Class 3: General Google Trends volatility for political figures**
Suitability: MEDIUM. The 90-day data shows high volatility (std dev 26.3, mean 21.5), but recent trend is strongly downward.

**Most suitable: Reference Class 1** - Post-peak decay pattern, given we're 6 days past the dramatic peak and value has already crashed to 9.

(c) Timeframe Analysis:

**Prediction window**: Feb 5-14 (10 days)
**Baseline comparison**: Feb 5 value vs Feb 14 value
**Current trajectory**: Value dropped from 100 (Jan 29) to 9 (Feb 4) - an 91-point decline in 6 days

Historical patterns from agent report:
- After Jan 13 spike (12), value decayed before Jan 17 catalyst
- After Jan 17 spike (28), value decayed before Jan 25-26 catalyst
- Current Feb 4 mini-spike (22, then 9) appears to be final decay phase

The Google Trends data shows 80% of 12-day windows have >3 point changes, meaning "Doesn't change" is historically rare (20% base rate).

(d) Justification:

The question asks about change between Feb 5 and Feb 14. Current value is 9 (Feb 4), having crashed from the Jan 29 peak of 100. The 7-day average shows rapid decline (54.1 → 20.0).

**Factors favoring "Decreases":**
1. Strong downward momentum: 91-point drop in 6 days
2. No major scheduled news events likely to drive searches
3. Post-scandal decay pattern typical after visual/dramatic events
4. Current value (9) already below 90-day mean (21.5)
5. News cycle has moved on; latest stories (Feb 1-4) are fact-checks/debunking

**Factors favoring "Doesn't change":**
1. Value already very low (9), limited room to fall further
2. Historical base rate: 20% of 12-day windows show ≤3 point change
3. If value hovers 6-12 range, could stay within ±3 points

**Factors favoring "Increases":**
1. Possible FEC filing release (Feb 6-8) could spark brief interest
2. Milwaukee speech (Feb 8) might generate local coverage
3. Potential surprise subpoena from Comer
4. Historical volatility (std dev 26.3) allows for rebounds

However, FEC filings rarely drive Google Trends spikes unless they contain shocking revelations. The Milwaukee speech is regional and unlikely to create national search interest. Subpoenas are uncertain timing.

The most likely scenario is continued decay toward baseline, but from such a low starting point (9), the value could stabilize in the 5-12 range, making "Doesn't change" plausible if Feb 5 and Feb 14 both fall in that narrow band.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate data is critical: 80% of 12-day windows show >3 point changes. This heavily weights against "Doesn't change."

Between "Increases" and "Decreases": The current value of 9 is already 58% below the 90-day mean of 21.5. While there's room to fall to 0-5, there's also mean reversion possibility. However, the recent 7-day trend is strongly downward.

Considering:
- Strong downward momentum favors "Decreases"
- Very low current value (9) means limited downside but also risk of stabilization
- 80% historical rate of >3 point change
- Minimal scheduled catalysts for "Increases"
- Possible minor catalysts (FEC filing, speech) could cause 4-8 point bump

Probability distribution reasoning:
- "Doesn't change" should be near its 20% base rate, perhaps slightly lower given strong momentum
- "Decreases" is most likely given trajectory, but constrained by floor effects
- "Increases" is possible but requires unexpected catalyst or mean reversion

Adjusting for floor effects (value already at 9, can't go much lower) and the specific 10-day window, I estimate:
- Decreases: 55% (continued decay, but limited by floor)
- Doesn't change: 23% (stabilization in 6-12 range)
- Increases: 22% (minor catalyst or mean reversion)

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 22%
Doesn't change: 23%
Decreases: 55%
