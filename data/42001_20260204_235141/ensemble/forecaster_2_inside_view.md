Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles:**
1. **Yahoo Finance (Jan 13, 2026)**: Factual core reports Omar's 2024 disclosure showing assets of $6-30M (via husband's businesses), up from negative net worth in 2019. Omar's denial statements quoted. Mainstream financial outlet, high reliability for disclosed facts. Opinion elements: political framing around Trump's attacks.

2. **KATV/National Desk (Jan 27, 2026)**: Factual summary of disclosure ranges, DOJ/House investigation confirmation, no criminal findings announced. Includes Pelosi comparison for context. Moderate-high reliability; mostly descriptive.

3. **Newsweek (date unclear, likely late Jan 2026)**: Comprehensive factual breakdown of asset valuations, fraud scandal context (Feeding Our Future), congressional wealth comparisons. Multiple named sources (Omar, Paul Kamenar from NLPC). Moderate reliability; mixes facts with partisan commentary.

4. **Quiver Quantitative (Jan 29, 2026)**: Reports Q4 2025 fundraising ($1.1M) and estimates net worth at $18.1M. Important caveat: their estimates may be "inaccurate or incomplete." Moderate reliability for fundraising data (from FEC), lower for net worth estimate.

5. **Fox News (Jan 26, 2026)**: Factual data on asset bracket jumps; Trump's investigation call quoted. Partisan framing but core disclosure facts verifiable. Moderate reliability for facts.

6. **TND/WCIV (Jan 27, 2026)**: Repeats same disclosure data, emphasizes investigation is about compliance not wrongdoing. Moderate reliability.

**AskNews Articles:**
- **Multiple Elon Musk wealth articles (Feb 4, 2026)**: Irrelevant to Omar; noise in search results.
- **Trump-Omar ISIS suggestion (Feb 3, 2026)**: Trump posted baseless ISIS link claim. Relevant as new attack vector but no evidentiary substance. Shows ongoing Trump focus on Omar.
- **Trump deportation/fraud claims (Feb 2-3, 2026)**: Trump called Omar "scammer," demanded jail/deportation, cited Minnesota fraud. Escalating rhetoric but no new factual developments.
- **OMAR Act introduction (Feb 2, 2026)**: Republicans introduced bill targeting campaign payments to family members, explicitly named after Omar. New legislative development creating news hook.
- **Snopes fact-check (Jan 23, 2026)**: Clarifies $30M is household not individual wealth; Omar's personal net worth is -$82K to $65K. High reliability for debunking.
- **Earlier articles (Sept-Dec 2025)**: Document initial disclosure story emergence and Omar's denials.

**Key Factual Timeline:**
- Late 2025: Initial reports of wealth increase emerge
- Jan 13-27, 2026: Major media coverage wave
- Jan 29, 2026: Q4 fundraising disclosure
- Feb 2-3, 2026: Trump escalates attacks; OMAR Act introduced
- Feb 4, 2026: Question opened

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **News cycle already peaked**: Multiple independent sources confirm the major disclosure story broke in mid-to-late January 2026. The Google Trends data shows spikes on Jan 13, 17, and 26-29. By Feb 4, the baseline value is 18—well below peak. The story is 2+ weeks old with no major new revelations since Jan 29.
- **Post-spike decay pattern**: Historical Trends data shows consistent pattern: every major spike (values 50-100) is followed by multi-day decay back to baseline (10-25 range). This is structural to how news cycles work.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **OMAR Act introduction (Feb 2)**: New legislative hook could generate secondary search interest, but it's a procedural story (bill introduction) not a scandal revelation. Named after Omar but not directly about her net worth—tangential relevance.
- **Trump's escalating attacks (Feb 2-3)**: Trump posted multiple times calling for investigation/deportation. However, these are repetitions of earlier claims, not new information. Trump's base already knows his position; unlikely to drive significant new general-public searches.
- **No scheduled events in Feb 5-14 window**: No hearings, votes, or major scheduled developments mentioned in any source. The DOJ/House investigations are ongoing but slow-moving (no announcements expected).

**Weak Evidence:**
- **General political volatility**: Omar remains in news but not specifically about net worth—immigration enforcement, ISIS accusations are different topics.
- **Fundraising disclosure (Jan 29)**: Already 6 days old by Feb 5; didn't create a search spike comparable to the wealth story.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 9 days (Feb 5-14, 2026)

The question asks whether the value on Feb 14 differs from Feb 5 by more than 3 points. Current context (Feb 4):
- Value is 18 (down from peaks of 50-100 in late January)
- Story is in decay phase, ~2 weeks post-peak
- No major catalysts scheduled

**If timeframe halved (4-5 days)**: Would increase "doesn't change" probability—less time for new developments, decay continues but slower.

**If timeframe doubled (18 days)**: Would increase "change" probability—more time for unexpected events (hearing announcements, new disclosures, Trump actions). Direction would still favor "decreases" given decay trajectory.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view base rates:**
- Doesn't change: 25%
- Increases: 32%
- Decreases: 43%

**Adjustments based on inside view:**

1. **Decrease probability should increase** (43% → 55%):
   - Strong evidence of post-spike decay pattern (all major spikes in Jan followed by multi-day declines)
   - Story is 2+ weeks old with no major new factual developments since Jan 29
   - Current value (18) is already near historical baseline (90-day mean 21.5)
   - OMAR Act and Trump attacks are secondary stories, not primary net-worth revelations

2. **Increase probability should decrease** (32% → 20%):
   - No scheduled catalysts in the Feb 5-14 window
   - For an increase >3 points (from ~18 to >21), would need either: (a) completely new scandal/revelation, or (b) major hearing/event announcement
   - OMAR Act introduction is procedural, not sensational
   - Trump attacks are repetitive, not novel

3. **Doesn't change probability adjustment** (25% → 25%):
   - The ±3 point threshold is relatively narrow given historical volatility (st.dev 26.3)
   - However, when values are near baseline (15-25 range), day-to-day fluctuations are smaller
   - Keep at 25% as the narrow band partially offsets the lower absolute volatility at baseline levels

**Calibration check:**
- 55% decrease reflects strong structural decay pattern plus lack of catalysts
- 20% increase accounts for low-probability upset scenarios (unexpected hearing, new disclosure leak, major Trump action)
- 25% no-change reflects the ±3 buffer zone and baseline stability

## Probability Calibration

The outside view established a 43% baseline for decreases based on historical spike-decay patterns. The inside view strengthens this significantly:

1. **Temporal positioning**: We're 2+ weeks post-peak, in the tail of the decay curve. Historical data shows this phase has >60% probability of continued decline.

2. **News catalyst gap**: No major scheduled events. The OMAR Act and Trump posts are moderate-intensity developments, not blockbusters. They might slow the decay but unlikely to reverse it.

3. **Baseline proximity**: At value 18, we're near the 90-day mean (21.5). Further large declines are less likely, but small declines (to 12-15 range, seen multiple times in Jan-Feb) remain probable.

4. **Increase scenarios**: Would require either (a) unexpected major revelation (DOJ announcement, new disclosure leak)—estimated at 10% probability, or (b) viral social media moment around existing story—estimated at 10% probability. Combined ~20% seems appropriate.

5. **Doesn't change scenarios**: Requires value staying 15-21 range for 9 days. Given historical volatility, this is plausible but not dominant. 25% reflects the stabilization tendency near baseline.

**Blind spot consideration**: The biggest risk is an unexpected DOJ or House Oversight announcement (subpoena, hearing date, preliminary finding). This could spike searches immediately. However, such announcements typically leak or get scheduled in advance—no signals in current reporting. If this occurred, I'd expect my forecast to look overly confident in "decrease."

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Google Trends value for "ilhan omar net worth" on Feb 14 differ from Feb 5 by more than 3 points (increase/no change/decrease)?

2. **Base rate**: Doesn't change 25%, Increases 32%, Decreases 43%. My final prediction increases the decrease probability based on strong post-spike decay evidence and lack of catalysts.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = Decreases (55%); Least likely = Increases (20%). This aligns with 2-week-old story in decay phase with no major new developments scheduled.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - All Jan spikes followed by multi-day declines (strong factual pattern)
   - Story broke Jan 13-27; now Feb 4 (temporal decay)
   - No hearings/major events scheduled Feb 5-14 (absence of catalysts)
   - Current value 18 near 90-day baseline 21.5 (baseline proximity)
   - OMAR Act/Trump posts are secondary stories (moderate relevance)

5. **Blind spot**: Unexpected DOJ/House announcement of hearing or subpoena would spike searches. If this occurs, my "decrease" confidence was too high. Estimated probability of such surprise: ~15%.

6. **Technical check**: Probabilities sum to 100, all between 0-100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [20, 25, 55]
