Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**New York Post (Jan 26, 2026):** Mainstream tabloid reporting Trump's announcement of DOJ/Congressional investigations. Contains factual financial disclosure data (Rose Lake Capital valued up to $25M in 2024 vs $42.44 in 2022) alongside political claims. Quality: Moderate - factual data verifiable, but partisan framing. Date: Recent, within the spike period.

**Yahoo Finance (Jan 13, 2026):** Financial news outlet providing detailed disclosure analysis. Reports specific valuation ranges from May 2025 filing. Quality: High for factual financial data. Date: Early in the controversy cycle.

**Fox News (Jan 26, 2026):** Conservative outlet emphasizing wealth increase narrative with chart visualization. Provides specific asset valuations and ranges. Quality: Moderate - accurate on disclosure data, partisan editorial slant. Date: Peak of media attention.

**Snopes (Feb 1, 2026):** Fact-checking outlet debunking false claims about the Jan 27 town hall attacker. Quality: High for verification work. Date: Post-peak, addressing misinformation. Key fact: Previous DOJ investigation "stalled for lack of evidence."

**KMPH (Jan 27, 2026):** Local TV affiliate reporting on Trump statements and Congressional scrutiny. Quality: Moderate - aggregates other reporting. Date: Day of town hall incident.

**The National Desk (Feb 4, 2026):** Fact-check piece providing context on congressional wealth reporting. Quality: High for methodological explanation of disclosure brackets. Date: Most recent, during decline phase.

**Agent Report:** Comprehensive timeline mapping Google Trends spikes to news events. Identifies five discrete bursts with specific index values and drivers. Quality: High analytical value, synthesizes multiple sources. Identifies forward-looking events (FEC filing Feb 6-8, Milwaukee event Feb 8).

**Google Trends Data:** Quantitative baseline showing current value of 9, 90-day mean of 21.5, recent declining trend (20.0 vs 54.1 seven-day averages). Critical finding: Only 20% of 12-day windows show changes ≤3 points.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Political scandal Google Trends patterns**
- Characteristics: Sharp spikes following breaking news, rapid decay unless sustained by new developments
- Suitability: High - Omar story follows classic scandal-driven search pattern
- Historical pattern: 80% of comparable windows show >3 point changes

**Reference Class 2: Congressional ethics investigation search patterns**
- Characteristics: Initial spike, sustained elevated interest during active investigation phases, renewed spikes at key milestones
- Suitability: Moderate - depends on whether new investigative developments emerge
- Pattern: Episodic rather than linear

**Reference Class 3: "Net worth" searches for public figures**
- Characteristics: Baseline interest with spikes during controversies, gradual return to baseline
- Suitability: High - directly applicable to search term structure
- Pattern: Mean reversion after news cycles conclude

**Most suitable: Reference Class 1** - The specific search term "ilhan omar net worth" is driven by scandal/controversy news cycles rather than sustained investigative interest.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window:** Feb 5-14, 2026 (10 days)
**Current position:** Feb 4, 2026 - 8 days after peak (Jan 29: index=100), 5 days after fact-check wave (Feb 1-4)

**Historical pattern over similar periods:**
- Jan 29-Feb 4 (6 days): Declined from 100 to 9 (91-point drop)
- Post-spike decay rate: ~15 points/day average
- Current value (9) is 58% below 90-day mean (21.5)
- Recent 7-day average (20.0) vs prior 7-day (54.1) = 63% decline

**Key observation:** The Google Trends data shows that in 80% of 12-day windows, values changed by >3 points. Given current value of 9 and baseline mean of 21.5, the question is whether we'll see:
- Further decline (to ~6 or below)
- Stabilization around current low (6-12 range)
- Rebound toward mean (15-25 range)
- New spike from catalyzing event (>30)

## (d) Justification

**Factors favoring "Decreases" (further decline):**
1. Strong downward momentum: 91-point drop over 6 days
2. News cycle exhaustion: Fact-checking wave (Feb 1-4) typically signals end of scandal peak
3. Current value (9) already well below mean, suggesting overcorrection possible
4. No scheduled high-profile events Feb 5-7
5. Historical decay pattern: Scandal-driven searches typically overshoot baseline before stabilizing

**Factors favoring "Doesn't change" (±3 points, range 6-12):**
1. Statistical rarity: Only 20% of 12-day windows show ≤3 point changes
2. Current value near potential floor: Already 58% below mean
3. Baseline interest exists independent of scandal

**Factors favoring "Increases" (rebound >12):**
1. FEC year-end report (Feb 6-8): Could trigger renewed interest if disclosures reveal new information
2. Milwaukee keynote speech (Feb 8): Local media coverage could spike regional searches
3. Potential Oversight Committee action: Comer indicated subpoenas possible "at any time"
4. Mean reversion tendency: Current value 12.5 points below 90-day mean
5. Historical pattern: 80% of windows show >3 point changes, and current position is at extreme low

**Critical assessment:**
The question asks about Feb 14 value relative to Feb 5 value. We're currently at 9 (Feb 4). If Feb 5 stabilizes around 8-10, then:
- "Decreases" requires Feb 14 < 5 (further 40%+ decline from already-low base)
- "Doesn't change" requires Feb 14 in 5-13 range
- "Increases" requires Feb 14 > 13

The most significant factor is the FEC filing window (Feb 6-8) and potential committee action. These are the only near-term catalysts that could reverse the downward trend. However, the filing is routine and may not contain newsworthy information. The 80% base rate of >3 point changes suggests volatility is the norm, but the direction matters.

Given the extreme current low (9 vs 21.5 mean), mathematical mean reversion suggests upward pressure. However, the recent decay momentum is strong, and absent a new catalyst, continued decline to a true baseline (5-7 range) is plausible before any rebound.

Outside view calibration:

**Base rate tethering:**
- 80% of 12-day windows show >3 point change (either direction)
- 20% show ≤3 point change
- This establishes "Doesn't change" baseline probability at ~20%

**Directional considerations:**
Given current extreme low position (9 vs mean 21.5):
- Pure mean reversion logic favors "Increases"
- Recent momentum (91-point decline) favors continued "Decreases"
- Statistical volatility (80% change rate) disfavors stability

**Catalyst assessment:**
- FEC filing (Feb 6-8): 40% probability of generating newsworthy content that increases searches
- Milwaukee event (Feb 8): 25% probability of sufficient coverage to move needle
- Committee action (Feb 5-14): 20% probability of subpoena/hearing announcement
- Combined probability of ANY catalyst: ~60-65%

**Adjustment for extreme current value:**
At index=9, we're at ~42% of mean. Further decline to 5-6 represents limited downside (33-44% additional drop), while rebound to 15-20 represents 67-122% upside. The asymmetry favors "Increases" over "Decreases."

**Domain-specific upset rate:**
Political scandal searches show high volatility but tend toward mean reversion unless sustained by ongoing developments. The fact-check wave (Feb 1-4) typically marks cycle end, but scheduled events create rebound potential.

**Probability distribution reasoning:**
- "Doesn't change" (6-12 range on Feb 14): 20% base rate holds
- "Increases" (>12 on Feb 14): 60% - combines catalyst probability with mean reversion
- "Decreases" (<6 on Feb 14): 20% - continued momentum despite limited downside room

**Calibration check:**
These probabilities reflect:
- 60% chance of at least one newsworthy event Feb 6-14
- 20% chance of perfect stability (statistically rare)
- 20% chance of continued decay to true baseline despite being near floor

Outside View Prediction:

Increases: 58%
Doesn't change: 22%
Decreases: 20%
