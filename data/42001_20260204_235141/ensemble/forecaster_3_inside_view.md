Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Between 2026-02-05 and 2026-02-14 (US Google Trends, fixed 2026-01-15 to 2026-02-14), compare the timeline values: **“Doesn’t change”** if Feb14 is within ±3 of Feb5; **“Increases”** if >+3; **“Decreases”** if <-3.

(a) Source analysis (summary, quality, date)

- Yahoo Finance (Jan 13, 2026): Summarizes claims Omar’s net worth rose due to spouse-linked assets in disclosure ranges; includes Omar denial. **Quality: fairly high** for disclosure mechanics; some political context. **Date: early** in the controversy.
- Fox News (Jan 26, 2026): Emphasizes “eye-popping jump,” uses disclosure brackets/midpoints; includes Trump calls for investigation. **Quality: moderate** (factual disclosure ranges likely correct; partisan framing). **Date: near peak attention.**
- Newsweek (recent, per summary): Similar disclosure-range story; includes context that no evidence ties Omar to fraud. **Quality: moderate-high** (mixed commentary, but generally editorially restrained vs partisan outlets). **Date: during attention cycle.**
- KATV / The National Desk fact-check style piece (Jan 27, 2026): Explains disclosure bracket system; notes DOJ/House GOP investigative efforts; no criminal findings. **Quality: moderate-high** (informational explainer). **Date: late-Jan.**
- Snopes (Jan 23, 2026): Adds context: “$6–$30M” is household/spouse-linked ranges, not necessarily Omar personal net worth; highlights how the claim is commonly misrepresented. **Quality: high** (methodological and careful). **Date: late-Jan.**
- QuiverQuant (Jan 29, 2026): Fundraising update; includes estimated net worth model. **Quality: moderate** (model-based estimates; disclaimer that data may be inaccurate/incomplete). **Date: late-Jan.**
- The Independent (Feb 3, 2026): Reports Trump escalating attacks (ISIS insinuation), notes no evidence. **Quality: high** for the fact of Trump posting/feud; political content. **Date: very recent (key for early-Feb attention).**
- Breitbart / Western Journal / FreeRepublic reposts (Feb 2, 2026 and earlier): Claims about fraud, deportation, “OMAR Act,” etc. **Quality: low-moderate** (often partisan, may contain factual hooks like “bill introduced,” but high spin and selective sourcing). **Date: very recent.**
- CelebrityNetWorth (Jan 27, 2026): Repackages disclosure narrative with sensational framing. **Quality: low-moderate** (entertainment-finance hybrid; can be directionally right but not rigorous). **Date: late-Jan.**
- AskNews items on Musk net worth: **Not relevant** to “ilhan omar net worth” except as generic “net worth” noise; should not move this specific query much.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted for what moves Feb14 vs Feb5)

Strong evidence
- **Post-spike decay is typical** for scandal-driven “net worth” searches; once the main disclosure story is digested, interest usually falls toward a low floor unless *new* developments occur.
- **Resolution hinges on Feb14 level (not max)**: for “Increases,” a *late-window* catalyst (roughly Feb11–Feb14) is disproportionately important; early-Feb attention that fades by Feb14 won’t help “Increases.”

Moderate evidence
- **Fresh early-Feb salvos** (Independent Feb3; partisan pieces Feb2 about “OMAR Act” and Trump posts) raise the odds that Feb5 isn’t at the absolute floor (i.e., Feb5 could be modestly elevated). That mechanically makes “Decreases” easier (more room to drop by >3) and makes “Increases” harder (needs a later surge that persists to Feb14).
- **Institutional action uncertainty** (DOJ/House GOP “investigative efforts,” talk of subpoenas): could create a renewed bump, but timing is unclear; also many such steps don’t happen on predictable schedules.

Weak evidence
- Routine fundraising/FEC-related coverage (QuiverQuant) is unlikely to drive a sustained query-specific increase through Feb14 unless packaged as a new scandal angle.
- Generic “net worth” news (e.g., Musk) unlikely to affect this specific search.

Net: the evidence mix favors either (i) continued fade, or (ii) flat-ish low levels, with “Increases” requiring a well-timed late catalyst.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Forecast window: **10 days** (Feb 5 → Feb 14).
- If halved (~5 days): I’d raise “Doesn’t change,” because short windows at low levels often stay within ±3 unless a major breaking story hits.
- If doubled (~20 days): I’d raise “Increases” modestly (more time for a subpoena/hearing/viral moment) but also raise “Decreases” if we expect eventual return to near-zero; direction would depend on whether investigations generate concrete steps.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustments vs outside-view base rates)

Outside view base rates provided: Increases 58 / Doesn’t change 22 / Decreases 20.

Key inside-view corrections:
1) **Asymmetric timing requirement**: “Increases” is not “any spike occurs,” it’s **Feb14 > Feb5 + 3**. With the story already hot in late-Jan and still getting fresh attention Feb2–3, **Feb5 may start somewhat elevated**, meaning increases require *another* late push that remains visible on Feb14.
2) **Likely low-floor behavior** for a niche query: absent fresh developments, “ilhan omar net worth” can drift down toward very low single digits. That makes “Decreases” more plausible than the outside-view suggested, and also makes “Doesn’t change” more plausible if both days sit near the floor.
3) **Catalyst risk remains** (subpoena/bill traction/viral Trump-Omar clash), but for “Increases” it needs to occur late enough to lift Feb14 specifically.

So I shift probability mass away from “Increases” toward “Decreases” and “Doesn’t change.”

Probability calibration

- I treat “Doesn’t change” as higher than the 22% outside-view because once a term hits low single digits, day-to-day values can cluster and stay within ±3.
- I treat “Decreases” as the modal outcome because (i) the controversy appears past peak, (ii) Feb5 may still reflect residual attention from Feb2–3 coverage, and (iii) without a late catalyst, decay to a lower floor by Feb14 is common.
- I keep a meaningful “Increases” tail for an unpredictable late-breaking event (subpoena/hearing/viral clip), but discount it because it must persist into Feb14.

Checklist:
1. Criteria: Compare Feb14 vs Feb5; ±3 = no change; >+3 increase; <-3 decrease (fixed Jan15–Feb14 scale).
2. Outside view base rate: [58, 22, 20].
3. Consistency: Most likely = Decreases; least likely = Increases; matches “post-peak decay + late-catalyst requirement.”
4. Key evidence: (i) scandal search decay, (ii) Feb14-level criterion, (iii) fresh Feb2–3 attention may elevate Feb5, (iv) low-floor clustering.
5. Blind spot: A major official action or viral moment on/near Feb13–14 could lift Feb14 and flip to “Increases.”
6. Probabilities sum to 100; all 0–100.

Probabilities: [27, 30, 43]
