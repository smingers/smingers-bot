Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological, all 2026 unless noted)

1. Yahoo Finance (13 Jan) – Factual recap of Omar’s disclosure brackets, quotes her denial; mid-quality, low opinion content.  
2. Fox News (26 Jan) – Highlights wealth jump, quotes Trump; reliable on forms’ bracket numbers, partisan framing.  
3. KATV / The National Desk (27 Jan) – Local-TV explainer; repeats bracket figures, cites DOJ & House inquiries; moderate quality.  
4. Newsweek (27 Jan) – Balanced piece; gives context, quotes multiple experts; good quality.  
5. QuiverQuant (29 Jan) – Data-driven but uses estimates; medium reliability.  
6. Snopes (23 Jan) – Fact-check of $30 M claim; high reliability on filings vs rumours.  
7. Recent Trump social-media posts (2 & 3 Feb) – Primary sources for fresh attacks; factual that the posts exist, content is opinion.  
8. Legislation story “OMAR Act” (2 Feb) – AP-syndicated style; factual that bill was introduced.  
9. Independent, Breitbart, Western Journal (2–3 Feb) – Report Trump rhetoric; factual that rhetoric occurred, partisan framing.  
10. Multiple foreign-language reports on Elon Musk (4 Feb) – Unrelated to Omar; noise for query.  
Google Trends current value: 18 on 1 Feb (fixed 15 Jan–1 Feb window).

(b) Evidence weighting relative to resolution rule (difference >3 between 5 Feb & 14 Feb)

Strong  
• Historic base rate: in past 90 days only ~20 % of 9-12-day windows stay within ±3 (internal calc).  
• Empirical decay pattern: term spiked (~100 on 26 Jan) then fell to 18 by 1 Feb – clear downward momentum.

Moderate  
• Fresh catalysts (Trump posts 2-3 Feb, OMAR Act 2 Feb) could rekindle attention but so far produced only mid-level 18 reading.  
• Ongoing House/DOJ talk: may produce subpoena headlines but timing uncertain within next 10 days.

Weak  
• Possibility of entirely new revelation or viral TikTok boosting searches.  
• Foreign-language Musk stories – unlikely to affect this query.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Window: 9 days (5 Feb–14 Feb). If the window were halved to 4-5 days the “no-change” chance would rise slightly because less time for drift; if doubled to 18-20 days “change” would be even more likely as decay or a fresh spike almost certain.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
1. Downward trend: from peak (~100) to 18 in five days suggests further fade; Google-search half-life for minor scandals ≈3-4 days.  
2. Value 18 still well above probable long-run baseline (<10) so room to fall >3 by 14 Feb.  
3. Catalysts: Trump may continue posting, but he already posted on 2 & 3 Feb with only modest 18 index; odds of another ≥4-point net rise within the 9-day window lower than continued decay.  
4. Volatility baseline already shows 80 % of similar windows move >3; thus “doesn’t change” capped near 20 % unless compelling stability evidence (none).  
5. Directionality bias therefore tilts to “Decrease.”

Probability calibration
Start from outside view (36 / 20 / 44).  
Shift 6 pts from “Increase” to “Decrease” because: pronounced decay, catalysts so far weak, 9-day window ample.  
Add 2 pts to “Doesn’t change” for residual uncertainty (possible plateau around mid-teens).  
Final probabilities: Increases 28, Doesn’t change 22, Decreases 50.

Checklist (abridged)
1. Options: compare GT index on 14 Feb to 5 Feb; >+3 = Increase, −>3 = Decrease, else No-change.  
2. Base rate used: 36/20/44 (see above).  
3. Consistency: Most likely = Decrease; Least = No-change? (actually Increase slightly likelier than No-change). Makes sense.  
4. Key evidence: a) Past 90-day volatility (only 20 % stable); b) Post-spike decay from 100→18; c) Catalysts already spent; d) Fixed-scale window means small absolute change matters.  
5. Blind-spot: Surprise subpoena/raid or viral video reignites term >3 pts upward on 12-13 Feb; would raise “Increase.”  
6. Probabilities sum to 100, within bounds.

Probabilities: [28, 22, 50]
