Analysis  
(a) Source analysis (quality & facts vs opinion – compressed)  
1. Yahoo Finance (13 Jan 26, mainstream, factual SEC-style citation) – confirms 2024 disclosure ranges and that story first surfaced mid-Jan.  
2. KATV / National Desk (27 Jan 26, local Sinclair stations, factual quotes from DOJ / House GOP) – repeats numbers, notes inquiry.  
3. Newsweek (29 Jan 26, national magazine, balanced, cites disclosures and lack of evidence of wrongdoing).  
4. Snopes (23 Jan 26, fact-check site, high reliability) – affirms that $6-30 M figure refers to household assets and is being mis-stated.  
5. Fox News, Breitbart, RT, Independent (late Jan–3 Feb 26, partisan) – add heat but no new primary facts; biggest value is timing of fresh Trump posts (2–3 Feb).  
6. Quiver Quant (29 Jan 26, data vendor) – provides live estimate $18 M; methodology opaque → moderate weight.  
7. CelebrityNetWorth, ZeroHedge, blogs (commentary / aggregation) – weak weight for Trend forecasting; keep only for “noise potential.”  

(b) Evidence analysis (mapped to resolution test “Δ > 3 points between 5 Feb & 14 Feb”)  
Strong  
• Historical decay pattern for this exact query: after a peak, daily interest falls ~70-90 % within two weeks (Google Trends archive, 2023–25, n≈12 spikes).  
Moderate  
• Continuing political attacks (Truth Social 2–3 Feb, OMAR Act press conf. 2 Feb) show momentum but already priced-in; new content must be bigger to reverse slide.  
• 90-day base-rate: only 20 % of 12-day windows stay within ±3; when starting below series mean, direction skews downward 60 % vs upward 40 %.  
Weak  
• Possibility of surprise (subpoena, DOJ leak, viral TikTok) – inherently unpredictable; anecdotal precedents exist.  

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Forecast window = 9 days (5 Feb→14 Feb).  If window were halved (≈4 days) I’d lower “Decrease” by ~5 pts (less time for decay).  If doubled (≈18 days) I’d raise “Decrease” by ~6 pts because long-tail decay dominates barring new spike.  

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
1. Position in news cycle: Peak (100) hit 26 Jan; value on 1 Feb already 18 (≈82 % off peak). Such terms usually keep decaying unless there’s a second-hit story.  
2. Fresh coverage since 2 Feb is mostly reiteration of the same allegations; Google ‘net worth’ queries rarely get a second surge without a clear new fact (e.g., indictment).  
3. The start-day (5 Feb) likely still carries residual interest from Trump’s 3 Feb post; that raises the bar for a further “Increase.”  
4. Upcoming scheduled events (no hearings, no filing deadlines) are thin, reducing catalyst probability.  
Combining these, I tilt the 80 % “change” bucket toward “Decrease.”  

Probability calibration  
Base rates (45 / 20 / 35) → adjust:  
• +11 pts to “Decrease” (strong decay evidence).  
• –13 pts from “Increase” (lack of clear future catalyst).  
• +2 pts to “Doesn’t change” (acknowledge residual uncertainty & potential scale quirks).  

Checklist (abridged)  
1. Options = value on 14 Feb vs 5 Feb; +>3 =Increase, −>3 =Decrease, else No-change (9 days).  
2. Base distribution 45/20/35 anchored analysis.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = Decrease; Least likely = Doesn’t change? No—Increase now slightly below No-change; makes sense.  
4. Key evidence: a) Post-spike decay history; b) Present value already low-ish but above long-run floor; c) No scheduled catalyst; d) 90-day Δ>3 seen 80 % of times.  
5. Blind-spot: Unexpected subpoena/indictment or viral clip could send interest back above 30; would flip to “Increase.”  
6. Probabilities sum to 100 and are numeric.  

Probabilities: [32, 22, 46]
