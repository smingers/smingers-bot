The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “ilhan omar net worth” change between 2026-02-05 and 2026-02-14 according to Google Trends?

The options are:
['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “ilhan omar net worth” at the time of writing this question (Feb 1, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 18; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=ilhan%20omar%20net%20worth&date=2026-01-02%202026-02-01).

Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-04 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model equipped with capable web crawlers and designed to generate lengthy, detailed responses. As such, you may use a longer query with detailed instructions. It is possible to ask multiple questions.
Nonetheless, you are advised to keep your query to at most four sentences.

For Google Trends:
If the question is about Google Trends data for a specific search term, use this source to retrieve actual historical data and base rate statistics. Your query should be the search term itself (e.g., "hospital" or "luigi mangione"). This will return 90-day historical data with computed statistics about typical volatility, which is critical for establishing base rates.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () **on the same line as and after** the query. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for Agent. Add a Google Trends query if the question involves Google Trends data.
