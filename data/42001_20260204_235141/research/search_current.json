Ilhan Omar's 2024 financial disclosure:** Reported assets valued between $6 million and $30 million, with interests connected to a winery and a venture capital firm listed as primary sources of wealth.\n\n2. **Rep. Omar's 2023 financial disclosure:** Reported assets valued between roughly $40,000 and $250,000.\n\n3. **Congressional base salary:** Members of the U.S. House and Senate earn $174,000 per year, a figure that hasn't changed in more than a decade.\n\n4. **Financial disclosure reporting system:** Under the Ethics in Government Act, members of Congress report assets within preset value brackets rather than exact dollar figures, which can result in wide ranges (e.g., someone with just over $5 million and someone with nearly $25 million can report the same range).\n\n## Current Investigation Status:\n\n- The Department of Justice and House Republicans have confirmed new investigative efforts related to Omar's finances.\n- The focus is on whether disclosures comply with ethics and reporting rules.\n- **No criminal findings have been announced.**\n\n## Comparative Context (Named Source):\n\n**Former Speaker Nancy Pelosi's finances:**\n- When entering Congress in 1987: held between $610,000 and $785,000 in stocks (with husband)\n- According to Open Secrets analyses: made at least $130 million in stock profits over the decades\n- According to Quiver Quantitative estimates: total net worth roughly $281 million (not from official disclosure filings)\n- Has not faced a formal DOJ investigation tied to her finances despite years of public debate\n\n## Expert/Institutional Opinion:\n\n**Brennan Center for Justice:** Members of Congress often have access to nonpublic information that can move markets and have the power to shape policy affecting industries in which they may hold financial interests.\n\n## Article's Conclusion:\n\nThe central issue with Rep. Omar is currently transparency and compliance, not proven wrongdoing. The reported asset ranges are allowed under current law, but the size and speed of the increase have prompted investigation and reignited broader conversation about congressional financial disclosure clarity.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.newsweek.com/ilhan-omar-net-worth-scrutiny-11284678\">\n# Summary of Newsweek Article: \"Ilhan Omar's net worth under scrutiny\"\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Net Worth Figures:**\n   - Omar's net worth jumped to between $6 million and $30 million in 2024, according to House of Representatives filings\n   - For 2022 and 2023, her net worth was listed as below $250,000\n   - She had relatively modest personal wealth for several years, with debts including student loans and credit cards\n\n2. **Source of Wealth Increase:**\n   - The wealth shift in 2024 largely came from businesses tied to Omar's husband, Tim Mynett (married in 2020)\n   - e St Cru LLC (California winery): valued between $1 million and $5 million; Omar's income from it: $5,000-$15,000\n   - Rose Lake Capital (venture capital firm): valued between $5 million and $25 million; Omar's income from it: $0\n   - Both companies saw a big jump in worth after settlements were reached in lawsuits around alleged fraud\n\n3. **Context on Congressional Wealth:**\n   - Roughly half of those serving in Congress are millionaires\n   - Senator Rick Scott (R-FL): worth around $300 million\n   - Mark Warner (D-VA): worth around $214 million\n   - If Omar were worth $30 million, she would not be the wealthiest person in Congress\n\n4. **Fraud Scandal Context:**\n   - Omar sponsored the MEALS Act 2020, which led to a federally funded nutrition program\n   - Fraudsters in Minnesota exploited the program for around $250 million through Feeding Our Future\n   - More than 60 people have been convicted of fraud; more than 90 have been charged\n   - Safari restaurant co-owner convicted in March; Omar was seen on video distributing food there\n   - No evidence has emerged connecting Omar's finances to the fraud schemes\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n1. **Representative Ilhan Omar (February statement to Business Insider):**\n   - Called claims she is worth millions \"categorically false\"\n   - Stated: \"I am a working mom with student loan debt...I am not a millionaire\"\n   - Attributed claims to \"a coordinated right-wing disinformation campaign\"\n\n2. **Paul Kamenar (counsel to National Legal and Policy Center, to The New York Post):**\n   - \"There's a lot of strange things going on.

According to Forbes, the combined valuation of SpaceX and xAI reached $1.25 trillion, increasing Musk's estimated net worth to $852 billion (approximately 124.5 trillion KRW). Prior to the merger, Musk held approximately 42% of SpaceX and 49% of xAI; post-merger, he is estimated to own 43% of the new entity, valued at $542 billion. This makes SpaceX Musk\u2019s most valuable asset, surpassing his Tesla holdings, which include 12% of Tesla shares ($178 billion) and stock options worth about $124 billion. Musk\u2019s wealth has risen sharply since late 2025, driven by SpaceX\u2019s anticipated IPO and market valuation growth. Additionally, a 2025 Tesla shareholder vote approved a potential $1 trillion stock grant based on future performance, though this has not yet been reflected in current asset values.

This marked a further escalation in Trump's ongoing attacks against Representative Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, who was born in Somalia and became the first Somali-American elected to Congress in 2018. Trump has repeatedly called for Omar\u2019s deportation, mocked her hijab, and made xenophobic remarks about Somali-Americans, including labeling them 'garbage' and accusing them of widespread fraud. There is no evidence linking Omar to ISIS. Her office has not commented, but she has previously condemned Trump\u2019s rhetoric as 'hateful' and said it has led to death threats. Tensions have intensified since immigration enforcement operations targeted the Somali-American community in Minnesota. Omar has advocated for the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), accusing officers of law violations. She and her family fled Somalia during the civil war and sought asylum in the U.S. in 1995, eventually settling in Minnesota. In a recent incident, she was sprayed with vinegar during a press conference while denouncing aggressive immigration enforcement, which she attributed to Trump\u2019s obsession with her.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 10:04 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-ilhan-omar-isis-feud-b2913331.html)\n\n**Elon Musk Leads World\u2019s 10 Richest Fortunes in February 2026**\nElon Musk remained the world's richest person in February 2026, according to Forbes' real-time ranking, with a net worth of US$ 775 billion as of February 1. In just one month, Musk increased his fortune by US$ 48 billion, widening the gap with his closest rival, Larry Page (co-founder of Google), whose wealth stands at US$ 277 billion. Musk's rise is primarily driven by the performance of xAI Holdings, his artificial intelligence and social media company, which raised US$ 20 billion in private funding at a US$ 250 billion valuation in early February. Musk\u2019s 49% stake in xAI is now valued at US$ 122 billion, contributing significantly to his total wealth. This marks a continuation of his record-breaking growth: he surpassed US$ 500 billion in October 2025, US$ 600 billion on December 15, and US$ 700 billion on December 19, despite Tesla\u2019s 61% drop in final 2025 profits.

He accompanied the video with a sarcastic message directed at Democratic Congresswoman Ilhan Omar, questioning what she had done to protect her 'corrupt homeland,' a reference to Somalia, her country of birth before immigrating to the United States. Trump has repeatedly targeted Omar, a Somali-American representative from Minnesota, with criticism over her origins and political views. He previously called for her imprisonment or deportation to Somalia, which he labeled one of the worst countries in the world, and claimed she should return to help 'make Somalia great again.' Trump also demanded an immediate investigation into Omar, alleging she amassed over $30 million in wealth\u2014impossible, he claimed, through a political salary alone\u2014and accused her of financial and political crimes. In response, Omar dismissed Trump\u2019s attacks as rooted in negative media narratives and described him as obsessed with her, saying he resorts to xenophobia when his administration faces setbacks.

Trump criticized Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as either 'the most CORRUPT government official in history' or 'the most INCOMPETENT,' stating even individuals with low IQs should have recognized the fraud. The claim is tied to a House Oversight Committee investigation into Omar and Mynett\u2019s finances, with reports indicating their net worth ranged from $6 million to $30 million by the end of 2024. Rep. James Comer (R-KY) announced plans to subpoena Mynett.

The bill mandates full disclosure of any campaign-related payments made to family members and seeks to end the practice of labeling such payments as 'campaign work.' According to Tiffany, 'Public office should never be used to pad a family's bank account,' criticizing long-standing ethical lapses across party lines. The legislation specifically cites Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota as a prime example, noting she paid nearly $2.8 million to her husband\u2019s political consulting firm during the 2019\u20132020 election cycle\u2014accounting for nearly 70% of her disbursements in the third quarter, surpassing the total amount all congressional candidates combined paid their relatives in 2012.

The claims are supported by an anonymous letter from state workers published by the Minneapolis Star-Tribune, detailing years of ignored warnings about systemic fraud, repeated attempts to escalate concerns, and retaliation against whistleblowers, including accusations of racism. Randy Anderson, a peer recovery trainer, stated he reported suspicions as early as 2022 but received no response until media coverage. The letter emphasized that warnings were dismissed, and whistleblowers faced threats. Trump also previously alleged Omar committed immigration fraud by marrying her brother\u2014a claim she denies\u2014and questioned her wealth, claiming she is worth over $44 million despite arriving in the U.S. with nothing. The article was published on February 2, 2026, by The Western Journal.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 01:45 PM\nSource:[The Western Journal](https://www.westernjournal.com/trump-says-scammer-ilhan-omar-jail-sent-back-somalia/)\n\n**Months After Claiming She Was Barely A Thousandaire, Ilhan Omar's 2025**\nOn February 10, 2025, U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar publicly debunked a viral conspiracy theory claiming she had a net worth of $83 million after eight years in Congress. In a direct Twitter reply to a self-described 'MAGA mom,' Omar stated her salary was $174,000 before taxes, she owned no home or stocks, and she was still paying off student debt\u2014asserting her net worth was in the 'thousands,' not millions. This portrayal aligned with her 2023 financial disclosure, which showed no real estate, minimal retirement savings, and total personal assets in the five-figure range, with her household net worth near zero when combined with her husband Tim Mynett\u2019s credit card debt. However, in a new financial disclosure released in late 2025, Tim Mynett\u2019s assets surged: his stake in Rose Lake Capital increased from $1,000 to a range of $5\u2013$25 million, and his stake in eStCru rose to $1\u2013$5 million. This elevated the couple\u2019s household net worth to a minimum of $6 million and potentially up to $30 million. The valuation increase followed the settlement of lawsuits against Rose Lake Capital and a reported $60 billion in assets under management, though the company generated no taxable income in 2024, indicating the wealth is largely paper-based. This shift raises questions about the consistency of Omar\u2019s public critique of wealth conspiracy theories. In contrast, her colleague Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s 2025 disclosure reported a maximum of $66,000 in assets and $50,000 in liabilities, resulting in a net worth of approximately $16,000. Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s partner, Riley Roberts, was listed as her 'spouse' at the 2021 Met Gala, sparking scrutiny over whether his finances should be included in her disclosures, though current rules allow such exceptions for charity event tickets.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 07:35 PM\nSource:[Celebrity Net Worth](https://www.celebritynetworth.com/articles/entertainment-articles/months-after-claiming-she-was-barely-a-thousandaire-ilhan-omars-2025-financial-disclosure-just-reveald-a-massive-marital-fortune/)\n\n**Fact Check Team: Omar's finances sparks broader debate on congressional wealth**\nRep. Ilhan Omar's 2024 financial disclosure, filed with the U.S. Clerk of the House, reports assets valued between $6 million and $30 million\u2014up sharply from her 2023 filing, which listed assets between $40,000 and $250,000. The increase is attributed to interests in a winery and a venture capital firm. Under the Ethics in Government Act, members of Congress report assets in preset value brackets rather than exact figures, which can result in wide ranges even for precise holdings. The $174,000 annual base salary for members of Congress has not changed in over a decade, fueling debate over how lawmakers accumulate wealth while in office. This is not the first time such concerns have arisen: former Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s net worth has been estimated at $281 million by Quiver Quantitative, based on stock profits exceeding $130 million over decades, though no formal investigation has been launched. Broader concerns about access to nonpublic information and potential conflicts of interest persist, with past examples including Rep. Spencer Bachus profiting from a pre-briefing market move in 2008, Sen. Dianne Feinstein selling stocks before the COVID-19 crash in 2020, and Rep. Rob Bresnahan selling hospital bonds shortly after voting on related legislation in 2025. Currently, investigations by the Department of Justice and House Republicans are focused on whether Omar\u2019s disclosures comply with ethics rules, not on proven wrongdoing. The controversy has reignited debate over the transparency and adequacy of Congress\u2019s financial disclosure system.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 02:35 AM\nSource:[WCIV](https://abcnews4.com/news/nation-world/fact-check-team-omars-finances-sparks-broader-debate-on-congressional-wealth-ethics-financial-disclosures)\n\n**Trump's claim that Ilhan Omar is worth $30M requires context**\nU.S. President Donald Trump claimed on Truth Social on January 22, 2026, that Rep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., is 'worth over $30 Million Dollars,' calling for an investigation into her finances. This claim stems from a broader pattern of online rumors circulating since late 2025, including on X, Facebook, and conservative outlets like the New York Post and Daily Mail, which alleged a sudden net worth increase from negative to $30 million since Omar took office in 2019. However, Snopes analyzed Omar\u2019s financial disclosures and found that the $6 million to $30 million figure reflects estimated valuations of businesses co-owned by her husband, Timothy Mynett, a political consultant and entrepreneur, not Omar\u2019s individual wealth. Her 2019 financial disclosure showed a single asset\u2014$1,001 to $15,000 in a retirement account\u2014and liabilities of $15,001 to $50,000 in student loans. Her 2024 disclosure, filed May 14, 2025, listed $1,001 to $15,000 in congressional savings account interest, three retirement accounts totaling $17,003 to $80,000, and partnership income from two businesses: eSt Cru Wines ($1M\u2013$5M) and Rose Lake Capital ($5M\u2013$25M). Omar\u2019s individual net worth, based on her disclosures, ranges from approximately -$82,000 to $65,000, while her household net worth is estimated between $6 million and $30 million. Omar\u2019s office called the claim 'inaccurate' and a 'right-wing smear campaign,' emphasizing that her and her husband\u2019s actual income was minimal. In a TikTok video posted September 3, 2025, Omar joked about wishing for millions to pay off student loans. Snopes concluded that while the numbers are not entirely fabricated, they require context and were misrepresented, and thus did not rate the claim due to lack of clarity on whether it referred to individual or household wealth.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 23, 2026 11:56 PM\nSource:[Snopes](https://www.snopes.com//news/2026/01/23/ilhan-omar-30-million/)\n\n**Ilhan Omar&#x27;s New Filing Reveals Net Worth Skyrocketed By 3,500 Percent In One Year**\nMinnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar's 2024 financial disclosure form reveals her household's net worth increased by up to 3,500 percent, potentially reaching $30 million, despite her congressional salary of less than $175,000. The surge is attributed primarily to her husband, Tim Mynett, a political consultant turned venture capitalist, and his company Rose Lake Capital LLC. In the 2023 filing, Omar reported the firm\u2019s value at less than $1,000; in 2024, she listed it between $5 million and $25 million. However, the company reportedly earned no income in the last year, raising concerns among financial experts and political opponents about the justification for such a dramatic valuation. The disclosure has reignited scrutiny over Mynett\u2019s business ties and the source of the wealth increase. According to the filing, the rise in net worth is also linked to another business owned by Mynett. The article was published on December 26, 2025, by Donald J. Trump.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 26, 2025 11:41 PM\nSource:[Donald J. Trump](https://freerepublic.com/focus/f-chat/4359116/posts)\n\n**Dem Rep. Ilhan Omar's Net Worth Soars To As Much As $30 Million While Preaching Anti-Capitalism**\nThe article reports that U.S. Representative Ilhan Omar, who has repeatedly criticized capitalism, has a net worth that has risen sharply in 2024.  According to the Washington Free Beacon, Omar and her husband, former political consultant Tim\u202fMynett, ended 2024 with an estimated net worth between $6\u202fmillion and $30\u202fmillion, a rise of at least 3,500\u202fpercent from the previous year.  The wealth is largely tied to Mynett\u2019s ownership stake in two companies \u2013 the California\u2011based winery eStCru\u202fLLC and the venture\u2011capital firm Rose\u202fLake\u202fCapital \u2013 whose combined stake was worth no more than $51,000 at the end of 2023 and grew to the $6\u201330\u202fmillion range by the end of 2024.  The article cites Omar\u2019s own statements, including her 2021 remark that \u2018America does not suffer from scarcity. We suffer from greed,\u2019 and her 2024 comment to Business Insider that she is a \u2018working mom with student loan debt\u2019 and not a millionaire.  The piece frames these facts as contradictory to Omar\u2019s anti\u2011capitalist rhetoric and labels her and other progressive lawmakers as \u2018socialist puppets\u2019 who benefit from capitalism while advocating its dismantlement.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 01:49 PM\nSource:[Zero Hedge](https://www.zerohedge.com/political/dem-rep-ilhan-omars-net-worth-soars-much-30-million-while-preaching-anti-capitalism?commentId=86b181fb-8e2c-4b4b-975e-c67fd1fa5b84)\n\n**The Blogs: Ilhan Omar Amassed $30 Million While Preaching Against the Wealthy**\nRepresentative Ilhan Omar, who has long positioned herself as a voice for the working class, disclosed a net worth between $6\u202fmillion and $30\u202fmillion in 2024, a rise of at least 3,500\u202f% from the previous year. The increase is attributed to her husband Tim\u202fMynett\u2019s stakes in a California winery, eStCru\u202fLLC, and a venture\u2011capital firm, Rose Lake Capital. In 2023, Mynett\u2019s interests were valued at no more than $51\u202f000 and $1\u202f000 respectively, with bank balances of $700 and $42. By 2024, the winery\u2019s value had surged to millions after a $780\u202f000 lawsuit settlement, and Rose Lake\u2019s stake had ballooned to $25\u202fmillion while the firm now claims to manage $60\u202fbillion. Omar\u2019s public statements\u2014such as saying it was \u2018categorically false\u2019 that she was worth millions and urging followers to \u2018check her public financial statements\u2019\u2014contrast sharply with the disclosed wealth. The timing of the financial gains coincides with Omar\u2019s leadership of a U.S.\u2013Africa working group and her calls for billions in U.S. funding for African development, raising questions about potential influence. The article cites court filings, financial disclosures, and campaign contributions to support its claims.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 10, 2025 03:44 AM\nSource:[The Times of Israel](https://blogs.timesofisrael.com/ilhan-omar-amassed-30-million-while-preaching-against-the-wealthy/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
