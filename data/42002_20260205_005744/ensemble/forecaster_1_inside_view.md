Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical/Background Sources:**

1. **Inside Political Law (Nov 10, 2023)** - High quality legal analysis describing Monaco memo that *strengthened* PIN requirements. Establishes baseline that current policy is robust and formalized. Factual, with clear documentation of policy requirements.

2. **Bloomberg Law (May 19, 2025)** - High credibility mainstream source. **Factual content**: DOJ official confirms policies "under review" with "no final decisions." Blanche proposed reorganization in March 2025. **Opinion**: DOJ official's stated rationale about "equal responsibility" vs centralization.

3. **Lawfare Podcast (date unclear, post-May 2025)** - High quality, features **John Keller (former PIN Chief, identifiable expert)**. Confirms consultation requirements exist and mentions Washington Post reporting on proposed changes. **Expert opinion**: Keller provides context on PIN's historical role.

**Recent News (Feb 2026):**

4. **AskNews Articles (Feb 3-4, 2026)** - Multiple sources covering DOJ turmoil:
   - **Minnesota prosecutors exodus**: 14 attorneys quit over immigration enforcement/civil rights issues
   - **Julie Le incident**: DOJ lawyer removed after expressing exhaustion in court
   - **Epstein files**: DOJ mobilizing 400 attorneys for document review
   - **No mention of PIN policy change** in any recent articles

5. **ABC News/CNN/NYT (Jan-Feb 2026)** - Coverage of Eric Adams case dismissal and mass resignations from Public Integrity Section. **Factual**: At least 6-7 PIN prosecutors resigned. **Key fact**: No official policy change announced, just operational chaos.

**Critical Gap**: No sources from Sep 2025-Feb 2026 document an *official* policy change removing PIN consultation requirements. The leaked draft mentioned in outside view has not materialized into official policy.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Against change by Feb 15**: 4.5 months since alleged leaked draft (Sep 2025) with zero verified official announcements. Resolution criteria require "official DOJ policy announcement, memorandum, or revision to internal guidelines." The absence of such documentation despite significant time passage is strong negative evidence.
- **Systemic chaos**: Multiple independent sources (ABC, CNN, Bloomberg, NYT) confirm PIN resignations and operational turmoil, but none report official policy removal. This suggests implementation difficulties even if intent exists.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **May 2025 "under review" status**: Single reliable source (Bloomberg) with DOJ official confirmation. However, 9 months later with no resolution suggests either abandonment or bureaucratic obstacles.
- **Organizational pressure**: Blanche memo proposing PIN reorganization shows intent, but intent ≠ implementation.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Political context**: Democratic lawmakers potentially facing charges creates pressure for change, but this is speculative regarding actual policy implementation.
- **Recent news focus**: Feb 2026 articles focus on immigration enforcement, Epstein files, personnel issues—not PIN policy reform. Suggests this isn't currently a priority.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: 10 days (Feb 5-15, 2026)
**Underlying Question Window**: 9 months remaining (until Nov 4, 2026)

**Current Situation**: 
- Community at 47% on Feb 1, 2026
- Question: Will it be >47% on Feb 15?
- This requires net upward movement in 10 days

**Timeframe Considerations**:

If window was **5 days**: Probability would decrease to ~40-42%. Very unlikely for major policy announcement in such short window without pre-scheduling.

If window was **20 days**: Probability would increase to ~48-50%. More time for potential news or leaks, though still unlikely without visible catalysts.

**Key Temporal Factor**: The 4.5-month silence since September 2025 is highly significant. If official policy change was imminent, we'd expect:
- Advance signaling to affected offices
- Media preparation/leaks
- Congressional notification (given reporting requirements)
- None of these are evident in recent coverage

## (d) Justification

**Factors Supporting Movement Above 47%:**
- Underlying probability of policy change remains substantial (9 months left)
- Trump administration has demonstrated willingness to disrupt DOJ norms
- Some forecasters may update upward on general DOJ chaos as proxy for policy change

**Factors Supporting Stability or Downward Movement:**
- **Most compelling**: 4.5 months of silence since leaked draft strongly suggests either (a) proposal shelved, or (b) significant implementation obstacles
- **Resolution criteria strictness**: Requires official documentation, not informal practice changes
- **Recent news priorities**: Feb 2026 coverage focuses on immigration, Epstein files—not PIN reform
- **Operational chaos**: PIN resignations may have *delayed* rather than accelerated formal policy changes
- **Information efficient market**: 47% already reflects substantial change probability; further upward movement requires new positive information
- **10-day window**: Too short for major policy rollout without pre-announcement

**Critical Insight**: The meta-question asks about community prediction movement, not underlying event probability. Even if underlying probability remains ~45-50%, the *direction of near-term movement* depends on information flow. The absence of new positive information in 4.5 months, combined with recent news focusing elsewhere, suggests slight downward pressure or stability.

**Metaculus Community Behavior**: Communities tend toward:
- Stability absent major news
- Slight mean-reversion after speculative peaks
- The September leak may have created a temporary elevation that has since stabilized

## Probability Calibration

**Base Rate (from outside view)**: 46%

**Inside View Adjustments**:

1. **Recent news silence** (-2%): Feb 2026 articles show DOJ focused on immigration/Epstein, not PIN reform. Suggests deprioritization.

2. **4.5-month implementation gap** (-2%): Strong negative signal. Official policy changes don't take this long without obstacles or abandonment.

3. **Operational chaos as double-edged sword** (neutral): While chaos might enable rapid changes, PIN resignations may have created bureaucratic obstacles to formal policy revision.

4. **10-day window mechanics** (+1%): Small probability of unexpected news or leak, though no catalysts visible.

5. **Community dynamics** (+1%): Some noise-driven upward movement possible, though equally likely downward.

**Net Adjustment**: -2%

**Calibrated Prediction**: 44%

**Reasoning**: The community prediction will likely remain stable or drift slightly lower. The current 47% already incorporates the leaked draft information from September 2025. The 4.5-month silence since then, combined with recent news focusing on other DOJ priorities, suggests the policy change has either stalled or been deprioritized. Without visible catalysts for upward movement in the 10-day window, slight downward pressure or stability is most likely.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Metaculus community prediction for "DOJ removes PIN consultation requirement before Nov 4, 2026" be >47% on Feb 15, 2026? (Currently 47% on Feb 1)

2. **Base rate alignment**: Outside view of 46% based on policy change timelines and Metaculus behavior. Inside view adjusts to 44% based on recent information silence.

3. **Consistency check**: "44 out of 100 times, the community prediction rises above 47% in the next 10 days." This aligns with slight downward/stability bias given information vacuum.

4. **Key evidence pieces**:
   - 4.5 months since leaked draft with no official policy change (strong negative)
   - Feb 2026 news focuses on immigration/Epstein, not PIN reform (moderate negative)
   - Resolution requires official documentation, not informal changes (moderate negative)
   - 47% already reflects substantial change probability (moderate, suggests limited upside)
   - 10-day window offers limited time for major developments (weak negative)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Surprise DOJ announcement in next 10 days removing PIN requirements. This could push community prediction to 65-75%. However, lack of advance signaling makes this unlikely (~10% probability).

6. **Status quo**: Current situation is 47% prediction with no recent major news. Status quo outcome is stability (45-49% range). Given information vacuum, slight bias toward status quo is appropriate.

Probability: 44%
