Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Primary Sources (High Quality):**
1. **Bloomberg Law (May 19, 2025):** Named DOJ official confirms PIN consultation requirements "under review" with "no final decisions made." Factual reporting from reliable trade publication. Key fact: review ongoing, no implementation.

2. **Washington Post/Lawfare (May 2025):** Reports DOJ considering removal of PIN consultation requirements. Multiple career officials quoted. Factual basis established by named sources (John Keller, former PIN Chief).

3. **ABC News/CNN (Feb 2026):** Reports mass resignations from DOJ/PIN over Eric Adams case dismissal. At least 6-7 senior prosecutors resigned. Named sources include Danielle Sassoon, John Keller, Kevin Driscoll. High-quality factual reporting with documented resignations.

4. **NYT Interactive (Nov 17, 2025):** Reports 200+ career attorneys fired/resigned from DOJ. Includes specific numbers and named sources. Documents institutional chaos but doesn't directly address PIN policy change.

**Secondary Context:**
5. **Inside Political Law (Nov 10, 2023):** Documents that Monaco memo *strengthened* PIN requirements in late 2023. Establishes baseline that current administration would need to reverse.

6. **Recent AskNews articles (Feb 2-4, 2026):** Document ongoing DOJ chaos - Minnesota prosecutors resigning, Epstein files mishandling, general institutional stress. Relevant context but no direct evidence of PIN policy change.

**Key Factual Finding:** As of Feb 5, 2026, there is NO public announcement of PIN consultation requirement removal. The requirement remains formally in place despite being "under review" since May 2025.

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence Against Policy Change by Feb 15:**
- Zero credible reports of actual policy implementation (despite 9 months of "review")
- Mass resignations from PIN suggest internal resistance, not smooth policy rollout
- DOJ currently in organizational chaos (200+ attorneys gone, multiple scandals)
- Historical precedent: major DOJ manual changes require months of formal process

**Moderate Evidence:**
- May 2025 reports established serious consideration of the change (directional signal)
- Blanche/Bove leadership shown willing to override career officials (Adams case)
- But: Adams case shows they're using *informal* pressure, not formal policy changes

**Weak Evidence:**
- General Trump administration hostility to PIN (contextual but not predictive of specific timing)
- No recent (post-Jan 2026) news specifically about PIN consultation rule

**Critical Insight:** The question asks about Metaculus community prediction on Feb 15, NOT whether the policy actually changes. The community prediction currently sits at exactly 47.00% as of Feb 1.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction Window:** 10 days (Feb 5 → Feb 15, 2026)

**Underlying Question Window:** 9 months remaining (until Nov 4, 2026 resolution)

**Key Dynamics:**
- With 9 months left and NO policy change yet, the base rate for "will happen" should be declining
- However, the Metaculus community is currently perfectly balanced at 47%
- In 10 days, absent major news, typical Metaculus volatility is ±3-5 percentage points

**If timeframe halved (5 days):** Prediction would shift toward 50% (less time for news, pure random walk)

**If timeframe doubled (20 days):** Slightly higher probability of >47% (more time for either decisive news or gradual upward drift if forecasters become more pessimistic about the policy change)

**(d) Justification:**

**Starting from outside view base rate of 51%:**

**Factors pushing HIGHER (toward >47%):**
1. **Negative momentum for underlying resolution:** 9 months passed with no action suggests policy change less likely. If forecasters update downward on the base question, they might push it below 47%, but we're asking if it goes ABOVE 47%.
2. **Recent chaos at DOJ:** The Feb 2026 news cycle shows DOJ in disarray. This could cut both ways, but forecasters seeing institutional chaos might slightly increase estimates that Trump admin will push through controversial changes without normal process.
3. **Metaculus behavioral tendency:** When predictions sit near 50%, there's weak evidence of upward drift as forecasters hedge toward "something will happen" (≈+2pp over 10 days).

**Factors pushing LOWER (toward staying at/below 47%):**
1. **Status quo inertia:** No news in 10 days = likely stays near 47%
2. **Tie probability:** Small chance (≈2%) it ends exactly at 47.00%

**Net Assessment:**
The underlying question (will policy change by Nov 2026) is looking LESS likely as time passes without action. However, the meta-question asks if the community prediction rises above 47%. The recent DOJ chaos and institutional breakdown could paradoxically make forecasters think "anything can happen" and nudge predictions up slightly. But the dominant factor is simply random walk around the current equilibrium.

**Calibration:**
- Pure random walk from 47%: 50% chance of being above
- Minus tie probability: -1%
- Plus weak upward drift tendency: +2%
- Plus small chance of major news (policy announced or definitively shelved): +2%
- **Net: 53%**

Probability calibration:

Starting from outside view of 51%, inside view analysis suggests slightly higher probability:
- The underlying policy change looks increasingly unlikely (9 months, no action)
- But recent DOJ chaos (Feb 2026 resignations, institutional breakdown) could make forecasters more uncertain
- Metaculus users seeing "DOJ in turmoil" might nudge predictions up as they become less confident in predicting DOJ behavior
- 10-day window is short enough that major news is unlikely but long enough for gradual drift
- Adjusting to 53% to reflect weak evidence that chaos → slight upward pressure on uncertainty

Checklist:
1. **Paraphrase:** Will Metaculus community prediction for "DOJ removes PIN consultation requirement by Nov 2026" be >47% on Feb 15, 2026? (Currently at 47% on Feb 1)
2. **Base rate:** 51% from outside view (symmetric random walk with small adjustments)
3. **Consistency:** "53 out of 100 times, the community prediction rises above 47.00% in the next 10 days" - reasonable given current equilibrium and slight upward bias
4. **Key evidence:** (1) No policy change in 9 months despite "review", (2) DOJ institutional chaos Feb 2026, (3) Metaculus historical ±4pp volatility over 10 days, (4) Weak upward drift near 50%, (5) Very low probability of major news
5. **Blind spot:** Surprise DOJ announcement in next 10 days (low probability but would push prediction to 70%+); alternatively, definitive statement policy won't change (would push to 30%-)
6. **Status quo:** Prediction staying near 47% is most likely; question is whether random drift goes up or down

Probability: 53%
