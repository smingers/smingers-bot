Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Justice Manual Section 9-85.000 (DOJ Official Document, Feb 2015/Updated Jan 2020)**
- **Quality**: Primary source, official DOJ policy documentation
- **Key Facts**: Establishes clear requirements that PIN approval is mandatory for charging decisions involving Members of Congress for conduct related to public office. This is the baseline policy that would need to be officially rescinded.
- **Assessment**: Highly reliable, factual documentation of existing policy requirements.

**Bloomberg Law Article (May 19, 2025)**
- **Quality**: Reputable legal news source with named DOJ official confirmation
- **Key Facts**: DOJ official confirms provisions are "under review" with "no final decisions made" as of May 19, 2025. Deputy AG Blanche's March memo proposed reassigning most PIN personnel to US attorney's offices.
- **Assessment**: Credible reporting of ongoing policy review. Factual reporting with proper attribution. The "under review" status is confirmed but not yet implemented.

**Lawfare Daily Podcast with John Keller**
- **Quality**: Expert opinion from former Chief of PIN
- **Key Facts**: Explains the rationale and mechanics of PIN consultation requirements. References "proposed changes" being considered.
- **Assessment**: High-quality expert analysis but provides context rather than new factual developments about implementation.

**Agent Report**
- **Quality**: Synthesis of multiple sources with specific dates
- **Key Facts**: 
  - Nov 15, 2023: Monaco memo actually *reinforced* PIN requirements
  - May 19, 2025: Bloomberg confirms "under review" status
  - Sep 22, 2025: NOTUS reports leaked draft showing "consultation requirement is suspended"
  - No verifiable updates after Sep 22, 2025
- **Assessment**: The September 2025 leak of a draft showing suspension is significant but unverified in my other sources. The agent notes this is a "de jure suspension" per leaked draft but lacks official confirmation. Critical gap: no documentary proof of final implementation or reversal after Sep 22, 2025.

**Critical Observation**: As of Feb 5, 2026, we are ~3.5 months past the alleged September suspension leak, but no official DOJ announcement, Federal Register notice, or Justice Manual update has been located. The original question requires "official" rescission - not leaked drafts or informal practice changes.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **DOJ internal policy changes under new administrations (2017-2025)**
   - Suitability: Moderate. DOJ policy changes can happen quickly but typically require formal documentation.
   - Pattern: Major policy shifts usually announced via memoranda or Justice Manual updates within 6-12 months of proposal.

2. **Metaculus community prediction movements on political/legal questions**
   - Suitability: High for this meta-question. We're predicting whether the community prediction will rise above 47%.
   - Pattern: Community predictions tend to move significantly when:
     - New concrete evidence emerges (official announcements, leaks, court filings)
     - Deadlines approach
     - Status quo becomes clearer

3. **Metaculus predictions on questions with ~9-month resolution windows**
   - Suitability: High. The target question resolves Nov 4, 2026 (9 months from now).
   - Pattern: With substantial time remaining, predictions tend to be moderately volatile and responsive to news.

**Selected Reference Class**: Metaculus community prediction behavior on political/administrative questions with medium-term horizons (6-12 months).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 10 days (from Feb 5 to Feb 15, 2026)

**Key Temporal Facts:**
- Current community prediction: 47.00% (as of Feb 1, 2026)
- Target date for this question: Feb 15, 2026 (10 days away)
- Original question resolution: Nov 4, 2026 (9 months away)
- Last documented development: Sep 22, 2025 leaked draft (4.5 months ago)

**Analysis of 10-day prediction window:**
- Very short timeframe for significant policy developments
- However, sufficient time for:
  - News articles about developments in January/early February 2026
  - Forecasters to react to any new information
  - Small to moderate shifts in community prediction (typically 2-10 pp in 10 days absent major news)

**Historical Pattern from Sources:**
- May 2025: Policy "under review" 
- Sep 2025: Leaked draft shows "suspended"
- Oct 2025 - Feb 2026: Information gap (no verified updates)

The 4.5-month silence since the September leak is notable. This could mean:
1. The policy change was quietly implemented (would support higher prediction)
2. The policy change stalled or was reversed (would support lower prediction)
3. The policy change is still pending (status quo, prediction stays near 47%)

## (d) Justification

**Factors Supporting Prediction ABOVE 47%:**
1. **Momentum from September leak**: The NOTUS report of suspended consultation requirements, if accurate, suggests the policy change was at least drafted
2. **Political alignment**: Trump administration has shown willingness to reshape DOJ procedures
3. **Time remaining**: 9 months until resolution gives ample time for official implementation
4. **Recent context**: Democratic lawmakers' detention facility incident (May 2025) provides political motivation

**Factors Supporting Prediction BELOW or AT 47%:**
1. **No official confirmation**: The original question requires "official" rescission - leaked drafts don't count
2. **4.5-month information gap**: No verified developments since September leak suggests possible stalling
3. **Resolution criteria strictness**: Must be formal DOJ policy announcement, not informal practice change
4. **Current equilibrium**: Community already at 47%, suggesting forecasters have priced in the leaked draft but remain uncertain about official implementation

**Critical Insight**: The question asks whether the community prediction will be HIGHER than 47% on Feb 15. The current prediction is exactly 47.00% as of Feb 1. This means we need to predict whether new information in the next 10 days will push the community prediction up (even slightly) or keep it stable/push it down.

**Information Environment**: The 4.5-month gap since the September leak without official confirmation is a significant data point. If the policy had been officially rescinded, we would expect:
- DOJ press release or memo
- Justice Manual update
- Media coverage of the official change

The absence of these suggests either:
1. The change is proceeding quietly (less likely given political sensitivity)
2. The change has stalled or been abandoned
3. Implementation is delayed but still planned

Given the short 10-day window and lack of recent developments, the most likely scenario is that the community prediction will remain relatively stable or drift slightly. Small movements (±2-5 pp) are typical in short windows without major news.

Outside view calibration:

**Tethering to Available Data:**
- Current prediction: 47.00% (Feb 1)
- Historical pattern: No major developments in 4.5 months
- Timeframe: Only 10 days for prediction to move

**Probability Considerations:**
- For prediction to rise above 47%: Requires either new positive information OR natural drift upward from existing uncertainty
- Base rate for 10-day movements: In absence of major news, Metaculus predictions typically show ±3-5 pp volatility
- The exact 47.00% figure suggests this may be a rounded/stable equilibrium point

**Calibration Logic:**
Given:
1. No recent positive developments to push prediction higher
2. 4.5-month information gap suggests possible stalling
3. Short 10-day window limits probability of major news
4. Community already aware of September leak (priced in at 47%)
5. Strict resolution criteria requiring official action

The probability that the community prediction rises above 47% in the next 10 days is relatively low. However, there's some chance of:
- Minor upward drift from optimistic forecasters
- Late-breaking news about DOJ actions
- Forecasters updating based on the long silence (could go either way)

**Statistical reasoning**: If we assume the prediction has roughly symmetric uncertainty of ±5 pp over 10 days, and current position is 47%, then probability of being >47% would be approximately 45-50% (slightly below 50% due to slight downward bias from lack of confirming news).

However, the 4.5-month silence and lack of official confirmation creates a slight negative information signal, pushing probability below 50%.
