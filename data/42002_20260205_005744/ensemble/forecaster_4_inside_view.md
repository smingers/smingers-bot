Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological order, key facts vs. opinion, source quality)

1. InsidePoliticalLaw (11 Nov 2023, law-firm alert) – fact: Monaco memo tightened and formalised PIN consultation/approval. Opinion: authors say PIN now “heavily involved”; high quality for policy text, but dated.
2. Bloomberg Law (19 May 2025) – fact: unnamed DOJ official says PIN approval rules “under review” with goal of decentralising power; no decision yet. Moderate-high quality mainstream legal outlet, single anonymous source.
3. ABC/CNN cluster (Feb 2025-26) – fact: multiple senior prosecutors resigned after politically charged interventions; opinion: reflects turmoil and political interference. Good for gauging institutional strain, weak for predicting formal rule changes.
4. Other news items (NY Times, Politico, etc., 2025-26) – fact: widespread staff exodus, proposed shrinking of PIN; mostly well-sourced reporting; imply momentum to weaken the section, but none report a formal rescission.
5. Lawfare podcast (Apr 2025) – fact: former PIN chief explains current consultation requirement. High expert credibility, but only background.
6. No article post-05 Feb 2026 announces an official DOJ revocation. Only a September 2025 “leaked draft” (NOTUS, second-hand reference) suggests temporary suspension—unconfirmed and not official. Overall, evidence for imminent, public, *official* removal over the next ten days is weak.

(b) Evidence analysis (weights with respect to “CP > 47 % on 15 Feb”)

• Strong evidence
  – None that a definitive policy announcement is scheduled before 15 Feb.  
  – Metaculus short-horizon behaviour: historical pattern—community medians move ≤±2 pp over 10 days in the absence of clear news (structural, difficult to change).

• Moderate evidence
  – 2025 reporting of ongoing review → keeps some forecasters alert to upside risk; can cause small bullish bias.
  – Continuing DOJ turbulence in 2026 → narrative that “removal still plausible” may attract new bullish forecasts.

• Weak evidence
  – Unconfirmed September 2025 leak of draft language; anecdotal, already baked into current 47 % median.
  – Recent ICE-related scandals (unrelated to PIN rule); likely noise for target question.

Net weight: inertia & equal-counts-as-No favour ≤47 %; moderate upside catalysts exist but without fresh trigger.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Time until timestamp: 10 days.  Typical Metaculus 10-day σ ≈1.5 pp.  If the window were doubled (20 days) I would widen jump-risk and raise Yes probability by ~4 pp.  If halved (5 days) I would cut it by ~3 pp.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside view (sticky random walk): 46 % chance of finishing >47 %.  
Inside view tweaks:
 +1 pp: persistent narrative of eventual PIN rollback keeps mild upward pressure as forecasters trickle in.
 -4 pp: equality (47.00%) resolves No; non-trivial 15 % chance CP stays exactly the same; downward drift bias as time elapses without action.
Net inside view ≈43 %.

Probability calibration
“Roughly 43 times in 100, the community prediction would be higher than 47 % on 15 Feb 2026.”

Checklist:
1. Title paraphrase: Will Metaculus median for “DOJ drops PIN consultation rule” exceed 47 % on 15 Feb 2026?  
2. Base rate stated (46 %).  
3. Consistency check: 43/100 outcomes → CP > 47 %.  Matches rationale.  
4. Key evidence:  
   a) No scheduled DOJ announcement (strong).  
   b) Metaculus ten-day volatility low (strong).  
   c) Equality counts as No (structural).  
   d) 2025 review news keeps upside risk (moderate).  
5. Blind-spot: Surprise leak or official memo between 5–15 Feb revoking rule could spike CP >55 %.  
6. Status-quo bias checked; leaned slightly toward No.

Probability: 43%
