Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. InsidePoliticalLaw (Nov-2023).  Reputable law-firm blog summarising official Monaco memo that strengthened PIN consultation.  Factual, well sourced.  
2. Bloomberg Law (May-2025).  Professional legal outlet quoting an on-record DOJ official that the rule was “under review”.  Reliable single source, moderate weight.  
3. ABC News / CNN cluster (Feb-2025) & NYT magazine (Nov-2025).  Main-stream news describing mass resignations over perceived political interference.  Factual on staffing turmoil; opinions quoted from named participants.  
4. Lawfare podcast (May-2025).  Interview with former PIN chief John Keller; expert opinion that rule still in force.  
5. AskNews article set (Feb-2026).  Fresh reports on over-worked DOJ lawyers, continued departures, and proposal to shrink or re-organise PIN.  All mainstream (Indian Express, Independent, U.S. News, E&E News, Yahoo).  Factual for staffing data; speculative on future policy.  
6. Metaculus datapoint: community prediction sits at 47 % as of 1 Feb 2026.  Primary quantitative fact.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Metaculus time-series: with ≤10 days left, median absolute move 2–3 pp; symmetric noise (structural, hard to change).  
Moderate evidence  
• 2025 Bloomberg report that elimination of PIN approval is under active consideration.  
• 2025–26 staff exodus and political pressure weakening PIN (logical but indirect link to increased chance of rescission).  
Weak evidence  
• Rumours (NOTUS leak Sep-2025) of draft language already suspending the rule.  
• Day-to-day DOJ turmoil stories not mentioning PIN explicitly.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Prediction horizon: 10 days (5 Feb → 15 Feb 2026).  
If horizon were halved to 5 days, volatility falls ~30 %, probability of crossing drops ~3 pp.  
If doubled to 20 days, volatility rises ~25 %, probability rises ~4 pp, mainly on greater chance of a leak or memo.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base: historical crossing rate for US-policy questions that start within ±1 pp of the cut-line and have ≤14 days remaining ≈ 45 %.  
Adjustments:  
+3 pp Because the current value is displayed as exactly 47 %; any tiny upward tick resolves Yes, whereas a tie resolves No—slight mathematical edge to upward side.  
+2 pp Recent coverage shows PIN haemorrhaging staff and leadership, marginally increasing plausibility of rescission news (though probability in 10-day window remains low, ~1–2 %).  
+2 pp Metaculus drift in old policy questions shows mild mean-reversion toward 50 % rather than away from it.  
−1 pp Long-standing absence of concrete policy change; forecasters may slowly discount probability, giving mild downward drift.  
Net inside-view: 45 % + 3 + 2 + 2 − 1 ≈ 51 %.

Probability calibration  
I model the community prediction on 15 Feb as Normal(μ = 0.470, σ = 0.022).  P(X > 0.470) ≈ 50.0 %.  
Shift μ upward by 0.002 from the adjustments above → P ≈ 51.8 %.  Round to nearest integer: 52 %.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Will Metaculus crowd forecast for ending PIN-consultation exceed 47 % on 15 Feb 2026?  
2. Base rate: 45 % threshold-crossing in final 14 days for similar US-policy questions.  
3. Consistency: “About 52 out of 100 times, the crowd forecast ends above 47 % ten days later.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   – Current value exactly on cut-line (tiny positive drift suffices).  
   – Historical 10-day volatility 2–3 pp, symmetric.  
   – Active DOJ review of rule (Bloomberg Law).  
   – Ongoing weakening of PIN through resignations (news Feb-2026).  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden leak that DOJ already rescinded rule (or announces intent) could spike forecast to 60–70 %, making 52 % far too low.  
6. Status-quo bias checked: no scheduled DOJ event; volatility historically small; hence probability kept close to 50 %.

Probability: 52%
