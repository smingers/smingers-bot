You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 47.00% on 2026-02-15 for the Metaculus question "Will the DOJ officially remove the requirement for U.S. attorneys to consult with the Public Integrity Section before prosecuting lawmakers before November 4, 2026?"?

Question background:
Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. 

--------------------------------

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/38209
- Original question title: Will the DOJ officially remove the requirement for U.S. attorneys to consult with the Public Integrity Section before prosecuting lawmakers before November 4, 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-01: 47.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before November 4, 2026 ET, the U.S. Department of Justice officially rescinds, removes, or otherwise eliminates the current requirement that U.S. attorneys must consult with or seek approval from the Public Integrity Section (PIN) before initiating prosecutions of federal, state, or local lawmakers.
> 
> This question will resolve based on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) or an official DOJ policy announcement, memorandum, or revision to internal guidelines (such as updates to the Justice Manual) explicitly stating that this consultation requirement has been removed.

Original fine print: 
> * The question refers to federal policy applying nationwide. If the DOJ removes this requirement only in part or for specific districts but maintains it elsewhere, the question will *not* resolve based on this alone.
> * A shift in informal practice or failure to enforce the consultation requirement will not suffice. There must be an official policy change.
> * The removal must be in effect before the deadline. A policy being proposed or announced but not implemented will not count.
> * If a court blocks the removal of the Public Integrity Section policy, this question will still resolve as **Yes** if the revocation is enacted in defiance of said court order.
> * This question concerns only the requirement for U.S. attorneys to consult with PIN before initiating prosecutions of lawmakers. If other DOJ rules get changed, such as the current requirement to consult with PIN before taking nonpublic investigative steps, this would not in itself be sufficient to resolve the question.

Original background: 
> In May 2025, a Justice Department spokesman confirmed that the Trump Justice Department was considering removing the longstanding requirement that U.S. attorneys consult with the [Public Integrity Section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Integrity_Section) (PIN) before prosecuting lawmakers ([<u>The Washington Post</u>](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/17/trump-justice-department-prosecutions/)). PIN, established post-Watergate, was designed to prevent politically motivated prosecutions by ensuring oversight from a centralized non-partisan unit. Under current DOJ policy, PIN attorneys must be consulted on investigative steps, and any charges against members of Congress require their approval.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/38209) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-15 02:18:55 is higher than 47.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 47.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-15 02:18:55, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

# Summary of Lawfare Daily Podcast on Public Integrity Section

## Key Information Relevant to the Question

### About the Public Integrity Section (PIN)
- **Established**: 1976 in the wake of the Watergate scandal
- **Purpose**: Dedicated office within DOJ to handle investigations and prosecutions of public officials at all levels of government
- **Staffing**: Staffed with career officials intended to be insulated from political influence and pressure
- **Jurisdiction**: Nationwide jurisdiction for matters involving abuses of public trust by government officials and election crimes

### Current Consultation Requirements
According to John Keller (former Chief of the Public Integrity Section, now partner at Walden, Macht, Haran, & Williams):

- **For election crimes**: Any matter involving election crime requires consultation with PIN to ensure consistency and subject matter expertise
- **For congressional investigations**: Any U.S. attorney's office or Main Justice component investigating a member of Congress for a criminal violation must:
  - Consult with PIN
  - Get PIN approval to take certain steps, issue certain legal process, file charges, or enter into plea agreements
- **Rationale**: These requirements ensure consistency nationwide and provide subject matter expertise in nuanced areas, including constitutional issues like the speech or debate clause

### Proposed Changes
- **Recent reporting**: According to a Washington Post article over the weekend (prior to the podcast recording), the Justice Department is considering changes to consultation requirements with the Public Integrity Section
- **Context**: Keller discussed "proposed changes to the Public Integrity Section that could hamper the Justice Department's ability to investigate and prosecute corruption matters in a fair and impartial matter"

**Note**: The podcast transcript appears to be incomplete at the point where detailed discussion of the specific proposed changes would likely have occurred.

### Source Reliability
- **Primary source**: John Keller, former Chief of the Public Integrity Section at DOJ, now in private practice - highly reliable source with direct expertise
- **Host**: James Pearce, Lawfare Legal Fellow, who also worked at PIN for a couple of years

# Summary of Bloomberg Law Article (May 19, 2025)

## Key Facts and Developments:

**Policy Under Review:**
- The Justice Department is reviewing policies that currently require prosecutors to obtain approval from the Public Integrity Section (PIN) before charging federal lawmakers with crimes
- A DOJ official confirmed that provisions in several sections of the department's manual are "under review" with "no final decisions have been made"

**Rationale for Review:**
- According to the DOJ official, the review aims "to ensure that equal responsibility is held in the field" at US attorney's offices "as opposed to centralizing all authority" in PIN
- The DOJ is looking to move more resources and decisionmaking outside of Washington

**Background on PIN:**
- PIN's career attorneys work through multiple political administrations and specialize in public corruption cases against elected officials
- Current policy requires federal prosecutors to consult with PIN during investigations and obtain their approval before bringing charges against members of Congress

**Related Organizational Changes:**
- In late March, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche circulated a memo proposing DOJ reorganization, including reassigning most PIN personnel to US attorney's offices
- The memo proposed "maintaining a core team of supervisory attorneys to administer relevant provisions of the Justice Manual"

**Recent PIN Leadership Changes:**
- Corey Amundson, who headed PIN since 2019, resigned in January rather than move to a new sanctuary cities enforcement initiative
- Multiple senior officials quit after being ordered to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams

**Political Context:**
- Several Democratic lawmakers face possible criminal charges for conduct at a New Jersey immigration detention facility earlier in May
- Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for trespassing after protesting at the facility
- DHS accused Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman of "storming" the detention facility

**Blanche's Prior Statements:**
- During Senate confirmation, Blanche demurred when asked by Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.) if he would abide by PIN's consultation requirements
- Blanche responded in writing that he "will familiarize myself with all memoranda and policies governing the Deputy Attorney General and will comply with their requirements"

## Source Attribution:
- The Washington Post first reported on the DOJ considering these policy changes

<Agent_report>
Query: Give a weekly table of community prediction for Metaculus question 38209 through 2026-02-05, flagging jumps over 5 pp. Also list and source all 2024-2026 DOJ statements, leaks, or media reports about ending the PIN consultation rule, noting dates and status. Conclude with present policy status.
This follow-up review revisits both segments of the user’s request in light of the newest material that could be located on the open web.

------------------------------------------------------------------
A.  Weekly Metaculus-community probability history for Question #38209
------------------------------------------------------------------
• What was sought A table of the crowd forecast every calendar week through 5 Feb 2026, with any week-over-week swing ≥ 5 percentage-points (pp) highlighted.

• What the new search found No additional trace of a machine-readable time-series, an export utility, or even a cached scrape for Q #38209 surfaced. The terms “Metaculus GraphQL question 38209” and variants produced only unrelated job boards and generic GitHub pages (search result 1). A focused attempt to locate a “history” page via Google’s in-URL search (site:metaculus.com "history" "38209") also returned zero hits.

• Outcome The gap identified earlier remains: without the underlying datapoints, no week-by-week table (and therefore no flagging of ≥ 5 pp jumps) can be produced from publicly available sources. The only practical ways to fill the gap would be:
  1. Log in to Metaculus and manually hover-record each point on the interactive chart—impractical for 100+ weeks;
  2. Obtain authorised access to Metaculus’ internal GraphQL endpoint;
  3. Locate a third-party archival scrape that has not yet appeared in any search results.

• Additional information still needed A raw probability series or an authorised API endpoint for Metaculus question #38209.

------------------------------------------------------------------
B.  2024-2026 DOJ communications, leaks, or press reports on ending the Public Integrity Section (PIN) “consultation” rule
------------------------------------------------------------------
The fresh search retrieved three primary, citable pieces of evidence:

1. 15 Nov 2023 – Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco memorandum that actually increased consultation requirements for investigations involving Members of Congress (Ballard Spahr client alert summarising the memo). Status: rule reinforced, not ended. (Ballard Spahr, 15 Nov 2023)

2. 19 May 2025 – Bloomberg Law story: DOJ officials confirm that provisions in the Justice Manual mandating PIN approval are “under review” and that “no final decisions have been made.” (Bloomberg Law, 19 May 2025)

3. 22 Sep 2025 – NOTUS report citing an internal Justice Manual draft: “The consultation requirement is suspended while revisions are ongoing.” (NOTUS, 22 Sep 2025)

These are fully sourced inside the current result set.  Other elements mentioned in the earlier draft (CNN 14 Feb 2025, AP/NBC 12 Mar 2025, PBS October 2025, House Judiciary 21 Jan 2026) still look plausible but cannot be re-verified because they are not present in the latest search returns.  They should therefore be treated as unconfirmed until fresh URLs can be captured.

Chronology (only items verifiable from current search results are footnoted)
• 15 Nov 2023 – Monaco memo tightens PIN oversight (reinforces rule) [Ballard Spahr].
• 19 May 2025 – DOJ spokesperson tells Bloomberg Law the Department is “reviewing” whether to end mandatory PIN approval; no decision yet [Bloomberg Law].
• 22 Sep 2025 – NOTUS publishes leaked draft of Justice Manual: language now says “consultation requirement is suspended” (de jure suspension) [NOTUS].
• No subsequent 2026 press release, Federal Register notice, or Justice Manual revision could be located that reinstates, abolishes, or otherwise amends the suspension.

Current policy status (as of 5 Feb 2026)
• De jure Justice Manual language shown in the 22 Sep 2025 leak (“suspended while revisions are ongoing”) is the most recent verifiable text.
• De facto Press coverage (NOTUS piece, Bloomberg Law interviews) and anecdotal reports indicate that U.S. Attorney’s Offices are proceeding without seeking PIN sign-off.
• Official certainty Absent a public DOJ directive dated after 22 Sep 2025, the policy is best characterised as “formally suspended, final disposition pending.”

------------------------------------------------------------------
C.  Remaining information gaps
------------------------------------------------------------------
1.  Metaculus probability time-series remains unavailable—critical for Part A.
2.  Documentary proof (press release, Justice Manual update, or legislative record) later than 22 Sep 2025 that either finalises or reverses the suspension.
3.  Independent confirmation of the CNN, AP, NBC, and PBS items cited earlier but not present in the current result set.

The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
