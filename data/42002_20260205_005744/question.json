    "description": "Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/38209\n- Original question title: Will the DOJ officially remove the requirement for U.S. attorneys to consult with the Public Integrity Section before prosecuting lawmakers before November 4, 2026?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-01: 47.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before November 4, 2026 ET, the U.S. Department of Justice officially rescinds, removes, or otherwise eliminates the current requirement that U.S. attorneys must consult with or seek approval from the Public Integrity Section (PIN) before initiating prosecutions of federal, state, or local lawmakers.\n> \n> This question will resolve based on [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) or an official DOJ policy announcement, memorandum, or revision to internal guidelines (such as updates to the Justice Manual) explicitly stating that this consultation requirement has been removed.\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> * The question refers to federal policy applying nationwide. If the DOJ removes this requirement only in part or for specific districts but maintains it elsewhere, the question will *not* resolve based on this alone.\n> * A shift in informal practice or failure to enforce the consultation requirement will not suffice. There must be an official policy change.\n> * The removal must be in effect before the deadline. A policy being proposed or announced but not implemented will not count.\n> * If a court blocks the removal of the Public Integrity Section policy, this question will still resolve as **Yes** if the revocation is enacted in defiance of said court order.\n> * This question concerns only the requirement for U.S. attorneys to consult with PIN before initiating prosecutions of lawmakers. If other DOJ rules get changed, such as the current requirement to consult with PIN before taking nonpublic investigative steps, this would not in itself be sufficient to resolve the question.\n\nOriginal background: \n> In May 2025, a Justice Department spokesman confirmed that the Trump Justice Department was considering removing the longstanding requirement that U.S. attorneys consult with the [Public Integrity Section](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_Integrity_Section) (PIN) before prosecuting lawmakers ([<u>The Washington Post</u>](https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/17/trump-justice-department-prosecutions/)). PIN, established post-Watergate, was designed to prevent politically motivated prosecutions by ensuring oversight from a centralized non-partisan unit. Under current DOJ policy, PIN attorneys must be consulted on investigative steps, and any charges against members of Congress require their approval.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":38209,\"question_id\":37484,\"last_cp\":0.47}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/38209) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-15 02:18:55 is higher than 47.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 47.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-15 02:18:55, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.",
