Analysis:
The community forecast sits exactly at 47 %.  Movements over the next ten days will hinge almost entirely on whether there is fresh, credible evidence that Attorney-General Andrew Bailey’s DOJ is actively moving—formally or informally—toward rescinding the Public Integrity Section (PIN) consultation rule.  Any of the following could bump probability upward:
• A published draft revision to the Justice Manual or to 9-85.210 that strikes the language about mandatory PIN consultation.  
• Leak or confirmation of an internal memorandum circulating among U.S. attorneys that waives the requirement, even if implementation awaits a comment period.  
• Statements from senior DOJ officials, the White House Counsel’s Office, or members of the House Judiciary Committee indicating imminent policy change.  
Conversely, stories showing that the rule is likely to stay in place (e.g., because of Senate pressure after last month’s corruption indictment controversy) would push the number down or keep it flat.  
Therefore the most relevant news items are: 1) any DOJ policy documents issued or leaked since January 2026, 2) congressional oversight hearings or letters about the rule, 3) investigative reporting on friction between Main Justice leadership and the PIN career staff, and 4) legal-analysis pieces noting timelines for Justice Manual updates.  Recent coverage (late Jan 2026) of the Aguirre bribery case, in which PIN reportedly insisted on retaining approval authority, is particularly germane—it could either signal an entrenched status quo (bearish) or provoke a political backlash that accelerates repeal (bullish).
