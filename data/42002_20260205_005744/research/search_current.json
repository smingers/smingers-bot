PIN will be heavily involved in all congressional investigations in either consultative or supervisory role\n2. The guidance may signal DOJ anticipates additional investigations involving Congress\n3. Third parties (e.g., tech/communications companies) storing congressional data should be aware of these requirements\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This article describes DOJ guidance that *strengthens* and formalizes PIN consultation requirements as of November 2023, which is relevant context for understanding the baseline policy that the original Metaculus question asks about potentially being removed.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://news.bloomberglaw.com/us-law-week/doj-mulls-changes-to-approval-process-in-public-corruption-cases\">\n# Article Summary: DOJ Mulls Changes to Approval Process in Public Corruption Cases\n\n**Source:** Bloomberg Law  \n**Date:** May 19, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**Policy Under Review:**\n- The Justice Department is reviewing policies that currently require prosecutors to obtain approval from the Public Integrity Section (PIN) before charging federal lawmakers with crimes\n- A DOJ official confirmed that provisions in several sections of the department's manual are \"under review\" with \"no final decisions have been made\"\n- The Washington Post first reported on the consideration to eliminate the requirement for federal prosecutors to obtain PIN approval before charging members of Congress and to no longer require consultation with PIN career lawyers during investigations\n\n**Stated Rationale:**\n- According to the DOJ official, the review aims \"to ensure that equal responsibility is held in the field\" at US attorney's offices \"as opposed to centralizing all authority\" in PIN\n- The policy change consideration is part of a broader effort to move more resources and decisionmaking outside of Washington\n\n**Organizational Context:**\n- In late March, Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche circulated a memo proposing DOJ reorganization, including reassigning most PIN personnel to US attorney's offices while \"maintaining a core team of supervisory attorneys to administer relevant provisions of the Justice Manual\"\n- PIN has undergone significant changes in early 2025: Corey Amundson (section head since 2019) resigned in January, and multiple senior officials quit after being ordered to drop corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams\n\n**Political Context:**\n- Several Democratic lawmakers face possible criminal charges for conduct at a New Jersey immigration detention facility\n- Newark Mayor Ras Baraka was arrested for trespassing after protesting at the facility\n- Department of Homeland Security accused Democratic Reps. Rob Menendez and Bonnie Watson Coleman of \"storming\" the detention facility\n- During Senate confirmation, Blanche declined to commit to abiding by PIN consultation requirements when asked by Sen. Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), responding only that he would \"familiarize myself with all memoranda and policies\" and \"comply with their requirements\"\n\n**Analysis (from article):**\n- Changes could \"cut the section's career attorneys out of the process in high-profile criminal cases against elected officials\"\n- Such changes could \"remove or weaken a guard against political influence in these cases\"\n- PIN attorneys work through multiple political administrations and specialize in public corruption cases\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/lawfare-daily--the-public-integrity-section--threats--and-criminal-contempt-with-john-keller\">\n# Summary of Lawfare Daily Podcast: The Public Integrity Section, Threats, and Criminal Contempt\n\n**Source:** Lawfare podcast transcript featuring John Keller (former Chief of the Public Integrity Section at DOJ, now partner at Walden, Macht, Haran, & Williams) interviewed by James Pearce (Lawfare Legal Fellow)\n\n## Key Facts and Context:\n\n**Background on Public Integrity Section (PIN):**\n- Established in 1976 in the wake of the Watergate scandal\n- Office of investigators and prosecutors based in Washington, D.C. with nationwide jurisdiction\n- Mandate includes handling abuses of public trust by government officials and all election crimes cases (campaign finance offenses, ballot fraud, etc.)\n- Attorney General is required to report to Congress annually on the Section's activities\n- Staffed with career officials designed to be insulated from political influence and pressure\n\n**PIN's Two Primary Functions:**\n1. Directly investigate and prosecute cases independently or in cooperation with U.S. Attorney's offices or other DOJ sections\n2. Consult and advise (and in some cases approve) matters handled by other DOJ offices\n\n**Current Consultation Requirements:**\n- Any matter involving election crime requires consultation with PIN\n- Any investigation of a member of Congress for criminal violations requires:\n  - Consultation with PIN\n  - PIN approval to take certain steps, issue legal process, file charges, or enter plea agreements\n- Purpose: ensure consistency nationwide and provide subject matter expertise on nuanced areas including constitutional clauses like the speech or debate clause\n\n**Recent Developments Discussed:**\n- Washington Post article over the weekend reported the Justice Department is considering changes to consultation requirements with the Public Integrity Section\n- The podcast also discussed potential prosecution of former FBI Director Jim Comey related to an Instagram post featuring seashells spelling \"8647\" (interpreted as \"get rid of the 47th President Donald Trump\")\n\n**Opinion from John Keller (named source, former PIN Chief):**\nRegarding the Comey matter, Keller stated: \"The fact that you have the former head of the FBI with law enforcement experience and some knowledge of the law certainly, and you have him doing it publicly and not trying to mask himself or anonymize himself in any way, suggest that his contemplation or understanding of 86 was not in terms of violence.\"\n\n**Note:** The transcript appears to be cut off mid-sentence when discussing the speech or debate clause.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/new-yorks-top-federal-prosecutor-steps-amid-tension/story?id=118796725\">\n# Summary of Article: NY's Top Federal Prosecutor, Several DOJ Officials Resign Over Mayor Eric Adams' Case\n\n**Key Facts and Events:**\n\n- **At least six top DOJ officials resigned** after refusing to sign onto the dismissal of NYC Mayor Eric Adams' criminal corruption case, according to sources.\n\n- **Three supervisory officials within DOJ's Public Integrity Section (PIN)** resigned, joining former acting US attorney for Manhattan Danielle Sassoon and two other career leaders from PIN.\n\n- **Danielle Sassoon resigned Thursday** after the DOJ moved to drop the federal bribery case against Adams.

We offered nothing and the department asked nothing of us.\"\n\n**Case Details:**\n\n- **Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove** directed Sassoon to dismiss the charges in a Monday memo.\n\n- **Sassoon's office had proposed a superseding indictment** that would add an obstruction conspiracy charge, alleging Adams destroyed evidence and instructed others to provide false information to the FBI.\n\n- **To date, no motion to dismiss has been filed with the court**.\n\n**Additional Developments:**\n\n- **John Keller (acting head of PIN) and Kevin Driscoll (senior criminal division official)** resigned when informed the case would be reassigned to PIN in Washington, D.C.\n\n- **Bove responded to Sassoon's resignation** with a letter accusing her of \"insubordination and apparent misconduct,\" stating she \"lost sight of the oath\" by suggesting she retained discretion to interpret the Constitution inconsistently with administration policies.\n\n- **Bove disputed the quid pro quo allegations** as \"false\" and claimed Sassoon had previously acknowledged this in writing.\n\n- **Assistant US attorneys on the case were placed on off-duty administrative leave** pending investigations.\n\n**Sourcing Note:** All information comes from ABC News citing unnamed sources and obtained letters/documents.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2025/11/16/magazine/trump-justice-department-staff-attorneys.html\">\n# Summary of \"It's a Culture Now of Fear': A Year of Chaos Inside the Justice Department\"\n\n**Source:** New York Times  \n**Date:** November 17, 2025  \n**Authors:** Emily Bazelon and Rachel Poser\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- **Personnel Changes:** More than 200 career attorneys have been fired, and thousands more have resigned from the Justice Department during Trump's second term. The DOJ claims many have been replaced.\n\n- **Jan. 6 Pardons:** On his first day in office, President Trump pardoned or commuted sentences of nearly 1,600 rioters who stormed the Capitol on January 6, 2021, including more than 200 defendants convicted of assaulting law enforcement officers.\n\n- **Leadership Appointments:** Trump appointed Emil Bove (one of his personal defense attorneys) as temporary No. 2, and nominated Todd Blanche (another personal lawyer) for the permanent position. Ed Martin, a Trump ally who had never worked as a prosecutor, was appointed interim U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia.\n\n- **Targeted Firings:** 15 attorneys in the Capitol Siege Section (which prosecuted Jan. 6 defendants) were fired. More than a dozen prosecutors who worked under special counsel Jack Smith on criminal investigations of Trump were also fired, with leadership stating they could not be trusted to \"faithfully implement\" the president's agenda.\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\nThe article features direct quotes from more than 60 attorneys interviewed (many anonymously), including:\n\n- **Ryan Crosswell (Public Integrity Section):** Initially relieved by Blanche and Bove appointments due to their prosecutorial backgrounds, but later found \"things were 10 times worse than I thought they would be.\"\n\n- **Gregory Rosen (Chief, Capitol Siege Section):** Described the pardon implementation as a \"blitzkrieg\" and stated he was \"the angriest I've ever been\" when 15 employees were fired from his section.\n\n- **Mike Romano (Jan. 6 prosecutor):** Called the pardons \"incredibly demoralizing\" and described the justification as \"a lie,\" noting strong evidence existed against every prosecuted person.\n\n## Official Responses:\n\n- **DOJ Spokeswoman:** Called the story \"a useless collection of recycled, debunked hearsay from disgruntled former employees\" and accused it of bias.\n\n- **White House Spokeswoman (Abigail Jackson):** Dismissed the complaints as coming from \"anti-Trump government workers\" and \"D.C. bureaucrats.\"\n\n## General Themes Described:\n\nAttorneys reported being asked to:\n- Drop cases for political reasons\n- Find evidence for flimsy investigations\n- Take positions in court without legitimate basis\n- Abandon investigations of terrorist plots, corruption, and white-collar fraud\n\nThe article characterizes the period as creating a \"culture of fear\" and representing \"turmoil and controversy unlike any in the history of the Justice Department.\"\n\n**Note:** The article excerpt appears to be cut off mid-sentence.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/14/politics/eric-adams-justice-department-tick-tock\">\n# Summary of CNN Article: \"How Trump's DOJ sparked a crisis and mass resignations over the Eric Adams case\"\n\n**Date:** February 14, 2025  \n**Authors:** Kara Scannell, Evan Perez, Hannah Rabinowitz, Jeremy Herb\n\n## Key Facts and Events:\n\n### Mass Resignations\n- **Seven prosecutors** resigned over 36 hours from the Southern District of New York (SDNY) and the DOJ's Public Integrity Section rather than carry out orders to dismiss corruption charges against NYC Mayor Eric Adams\n- Resignations included:\n  - Danielle Sassoon, Trump-appointed acting US Attorney for SDNY (clerked for Justice Scalia)\n  - Hagan Scotten, Assistant US Attorney (clerked for Chief Justice Roberts)\n  - Kevin Driscoll, top career criminal division prosecutor overseeing Public Integrity Section\n  - John Keller, acting head of Public Integrity Section\n  - Three additional Public Integrity prosecutors who resigned during a video call with Bove\n\n### DOJ Leadership Actions\n- Acting Deputy Attorney General Emil Bove led a Friday meeting with the Public Integrity Section demanding they choose one career lawyer to file dismissal of Adams charges\n- Bove didn't explicitly threaten firing, but the wave of resignations \"made clear the stakes\"\n- Late Friday, Bove along with prosecutors Ed Sullivan and Antoinette Bacon filed the dismissal\n\n### Prosecutorial Concerns\n- Prosecutors characterized the dismissal order as a \"quid pro quo\"\n- Bove's Monday order cited Adams' role as mayor helping the Trump administration combat illegal immigration as partial justification for dismissal\n- In her resignation letter, Sassoon wrote that Adams' attorneys \"repeatedly urged what amounted to a quid pro quo, indicating that Adams would be in a position to assist with the Department's enforcement priorities only if the indictment were dismissed\"\n\n### Official DOJ Position\n- DOJ Chief of Staff Chad Mizelle stated in a Friday memo: \"The decision to dismiss the indictment of Eric Adams is yet another indication that this DOJ will return to its core function of prosecuting dangerous criminals, not pursuing politically motivated witch hunts\"\n- Mizelle added: \"The fact that those who indicted and prosecuted the case refused to follow a direct command is further proof of the disordered and ulterior motives of the prosecutors.

During a hearing on February 4, 2026, before Judge Jerry Blackwell in St. Paul, Minnesota, Le stated, 'The system sucks. This job sucks. I wish you could hold me in contempt so that I could get 24 hours of sleep,' according to NBC News and FOX9. She was representing the DOJ in a case involving five detainees unlawfully arrested, with multiple missed deadlines for their release. Le reported handling 88 habeas corpus petitions in less than a month and described systemic failures, including needing 10 emails and threats of walking out to correct release conditions. She also admitted feeling undertrained and overburdened, calling the process 'like pulling teeth.' The incident follows a broader trend of DOJ lawyers resigning due to stress and ethical disagreements with ICE enforcement practices, including a January 2026 resignation of at least six federal prosecutors over the handling of the Jonathan Ross shooting and the death of Renee Good. Judge Blackwell expressed frustration that individuals with no criminal records were being detained despite court orders for immediate release. Le has since been removed from the cases.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 06:31 PM\nSource:[The Indian Express](https://indianexpress.com/article/world/us-news/this-job-sucks-doj-lawyer-asks-judge-to-hold-her-in-contempt-10514159/)\n\n**DOJ removes ICE lawyer who told Minnesota judge 'this job sucks'**\nJulie Le, a Department of Homeland Security attorney assigned to the U.S. Attorney's office in Minnesota, was removed from her role after telling federal Judge Jerry R. Blackwell during a hearing that 'this job sucks' and expressing she was 'overwhelmed' by the volume of legal challenges stemming from the Trump administration\u2019s Operation Metro Surge, a mass deportation effort. Le, who has been listed as counsel in over 80 immigration cases since the start of the Trump administration, said it was 'like pulling teeth' to get the Department of Homeland Security and Justice Department to comply with court orders. The judge had convened the hearing to investigate why Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) repeatedly failed to release immigrants wrongfully detained, as mandated by court rulings. Le reportedly told the judge, 'I wish you would just hold me in contempt of court so I can get 24 hours of sleep.' The Justice Department denied allegations of noncompliance, blaming judges for 'overwhelming' the system and asserting that the administration is 'complying with court orders and fully enforcing federal immigration law' after four years of 'de facto amnesty' under President Biden. The incident reflects broader discontent among government attorneys, with at least five Trump-appointed U.S. Attorneys resigning due to political interference, and roughly 5,500 Justice Department attorneys and employees either fired, forced out, or offered buyouts since 2025. In Minnesota, at least eight career prosecutors are leaving amid tensions over the administration\u2019s anti-immigration agenda, including Joseph Thompson, a former Trump appointee, who reportedly objected to the refusal to investigate the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an ICE officer, and was reportedly pressured to pursue a criminal case against her widow. The episode underscores growing institutional strain within the DOJ over political interference and ethical dilemmas in enforcement priorities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 06:13 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/doj-ice-lawyer-judge-minnesota-contempt-b2914033.html)\n\n**US Justice Department Removes Lawyer Who Told Judge in Immigration Case 'This Job Sucks'**\nThe U.S. Justice Department removed attorney Julie Le from her assignment with the U.S. Attorney's Office for the District of Minnesota after she told federal Judge Jerry Blackwell during a hearing on February 4, 2026, 'this job sucks' and criticized the government's failure to comply with court orders in immigration cases. Le, an attorney with the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), had been detailed to the U.S. Attorney's Office to help manage hundreds of lawsuits stemming from 'Operation Metro Surge'\u2014a Trump-era immigration enforcement initiative. During the hearing, Le stated she had worked days and nights without proper training, struggled to ensure U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) complied with court orders, and expressed exhaustion, saying, 'Sometime I wish you would just hold me in contempt, Your Honor, so that I can have a full 24 hours of sleep.' She also disclosed she is not white and that her family is at risk of detention, stating she shared the same concerns as the affected communities. The Justice Department said the Trump administration was complying with court orders and blamed 'rogue judges' for high caseloads. A source confirmed Le\u2019s assignment was cut short, though it was unclear whether she returned to DHS; DHS and Le did not respond to requests for comment. Six prosecutors, including senior officials, had resigned earlier in February 2026 in protest over the administration\u2019s handling of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good by an immigration agent.

ENRD, which began 2025 with around 400 attorneys, has lost hundreds of years of institutional expertise, including over 260 years of legal experience among the 11 senior officials interviewed. The division\u2019s enforcement sections\u2014particularly the Environmental Enforcement Section (which lost about 54, or half, of its lawyers) and the Environmental Crimes Section (which lost 13, or 35%)\u2014have been hardest hit, leading to a near-total halt in enforcement cases. Decisions now require approval from interim leader Adam Gustafson or political appointees. Civil penalties dropped from $1.88 billion in the final year of the Biden administration to just $15.1 million in the first 11 months of Trump\u2019s second term. Former ENRD leaders, including John Cruden and Todd Kim, criticized the 'brain drain' and its impact on environmental protection and government accountability, noting that ENRD\u2019s work has historically provided returns many times its budget. The Environmental Defense Section has also suffered, with at least half of its 60 attorneys leaving, including those who defended key climate rules. Court filings now cite 'limited availability of staffing resources' as a reason for delays. Despite a USA Jobs posting for 25 new litigators across five sections, ENRD has seen a drastic decline in applications, partly due to the elimination of telework and strict in-office mandates (8.5 hours daily, five days a week). Former staff say the work environment has become hostile, with diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives dismantled\u2014four lawyers, including former Office of Environmental Justice head Cynthia Ferguson, were placed on administrative leave. Current and former employees report that the perception of ENRD as a credible, mission-driven workplace has been severely damaged, with recent law graduates like Dan Khieninson stating they now see 'not a snowball's chance in hell' of pursuing federal environmental law under this administration. ENRD declined to comment, not refuting the departure numbers or working conditions described.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 06:55 PM\nSource:[E&E News](https://www.eenews.net/articles/staff-exodus-case-gridlock-doj-environment-division-under-trump-2-0/)\n\n**Pam Bondi Hit by Fresh Humiliation as Minnesota Prosecutors Quit in Droves**\nPam Bondi's Department of Justice (DOJ) is experiencing a significant exodus of prosecutors in Minnesota, with 14 attorneys leaving the U.S. Attorney's Office since January 2026\u2014eight of them recently\u2014due to objections over the Trump administration's immigration enforcement policies. The departures were prompted by the DOJ's refusal to open a civil rights investigation into the killings of two U.S. citizens, Renee Nicole Good and Alex Pretti, who were fatally shot by immigration agents in January. Prosecutors raised concerns about the administration's efforts to block state and local investigations into the killings, pressure to rush charges against defendants accused of assaulting federal officers without thorough probes, and the need to assess whether agents' conduct contributed to the incidents. A retiring attorney described the situation as 'the ultimate example of selective prosecution.' The criminal division now has fewer than 20 attorneys, down from at least 50 in prior years, forcing the DOJ to transfer in less experienced lawyers from other states. This shift may result in prosecutors focusing only on simpler cases. Meanwhile, the office is overwhelmed by hundreds of wrongful detention lawsuits from immigrants held under a mandatory detention policy, despite over 1,600 court rulings invalidating the rule. In a televised interview with Fox News, Bondi accused the departing prosecutors of abandoning law enforcement, claiming they 'wanted the taxpayers to pay for them to go on vacation' and asserting she had 'fired them all!'\u2014a statement not confirmed by official sources.

Blanche admitted the Department of Justice (DOJ) would not meet the deadline and acknowledged significant errors, including the failure to redact the names of dozens of victims\u2014many of whom were minors or had not publicly come forward\u2014along with the release of nude images of victims. He stated that 'mistakes were made' and that the DOJ had been working for 60 days on a document stack equivalent in height to two Eiffel Towers. Blanche claimed that once victims or their lawyers reported issues, the materials were immediately removed. When asked about potential prosecutions, Blanche stated, 'It isn't a crime to party with Mr. Epstein,' emphasizing that while misconduct will be investigated if evidence exists, mere association or communication with Epstein is not illegal. He also insisted that all videos had been released and did not contain improper sexual acts involving victims. Laura Ingraham challenged this, noting that some photos appeared to depict serious misconduct, to which Blanche replied, 'Unfortunately, photos can't speak,' underscoring the need for witnesses and evidence. The DOJ has been criticized for its handling of the redactions, with Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD) accusing the department of not communicating with victims\u2014claims Blanche dismissed as 'a lie.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 03:03 AM\nSource:[Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/crime/deputy-ag-tells-fox-news-it-isnt-a-crime-to-party-with-mr-epstein/)\n\n**Justice Dept says it removed Epstein files that may reveal victim details**\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced on February 3, 2026, that it had removed several thousand documents and 'media' from public access after discovering they may have inadvertently included victim-identifying information from the Jeffrey Epstein-related files released starting Friday, February 1, 2026. The DOJ attributed the errors to 'technical or human error,' with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche stating the affected materials represented approximately '0.001 percent of all the materials' and that the department immediately rectifies concerns raised by victims or their lawyers. US Attorney Jay Clayton confirmed that nearly all flagged documents were pulled down and that redacted versions are reposted 'ideally within 24 to 36 hours.' A section of the DOJ\u2019s Epstein files website was nonfunctional on February 3, 2026, prompting a request for comment. In a New York federal court, defense attorneys for the Alexander brothers\u2014charged in a sex trafficking case\u2014requested a mistrial, arguing that unredacted documents exposing their names had 'destroyed the possibility of a fair trial' and branded them with a 'most toxic association.' Judge Valerie E. Caproni tentatively denied the motion but expressed skepticism, asking, 'Government, really?' Assistant US Attorney Elizabeth Espinosa acknowledged at least one document mentioning the brothers should have been redacted and confirmed it had been removed. She also noted that remaining documents to be released are primarily related to civil litigation and may require judicial approval for public disclosure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 02:02 AM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/world-news/justice-dept-says-it-removed-epstein-files-that-may-reveal-victim-details-126020300085_1.html)\n\n**La Fiscal\u00eda de la Naci\u00f3n Se Definir\u00e1 Entre Tom\u00e1s G\u00e1lvez y Patricia Benavides**\nFollowing the removal of Delia Espinoza from her position as Attorney General of Peru, the Supreme Council of Prosecutors must select a new Attorney General for a three-year term. Espinoza was suspended by the National Justice Council (JNJ) from September 19, 2025, to March 19, 2026, due to alleged misconduct related to her refusal to transfer her duties to Patricia Benavides in June 2025. After her suspension ended, she resumed her role as Supreme Prosecutor and retook office as Attorney General. However, the full Congress later disqualified her from public office for 10 years due to allegedly approving a regulation that violated provisions of Law 32130, which assigns preliminary investigations to the National Police. Her disqualification expires in 2035, but she cannot reclaim the Attorney General position, as her term (2024\u20132027) has already ended. The JNJ formally removed Espinoza, a decision widely viewed as politically motivated despite being framed as administrative. The removal process is now under review, with a reconsideration possible as early as February 2026 or as late as February 2027, depending on the JNJ's pace. Simultaneously, Supreme Prosecutor Pablo S\u00e1nchez, who was five months from retirement, was abruptly removed by the JNJ, a move also seen as politically driven. The Supreme Council of Prosecutors now consists of interim Attorney General Tom\u00e1s G\u00e1lvez, Supreme Prosecutor Decana Zoraida \u00c1valos, Patricia Benavides, Luis Arce, and Juan Carlos Villena. With Espinoza\u2019s removal finalized, the Council will elect the new Attorney General by simple majority (three votes). While G\u00e1lvez is the most likely candidate, Benavides, Arce, and Villena are also vying for the role. Benavides seeks to restore her reputation after being removed in December 2023 for interfering in her sister\u2019s judicial case and reinstated in June 2025. Arce, a former Superior Court President and JNE member, is known for supporting unproven claims of electoral fraud in 2021 and was later reinstated by the judiciary. Sources suggest \u00c1valos and Villena may support G\u00e1lvez, but political pressures from parties controlling the Executive and Legislative branches may influence the outcome. The selection process reflects deeper political dynamics within Peru\u2019s justice system.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 06:40 PM\nSource:[LaRepublica.pe](https://larepublica.pe/politica/2026/02/02/la-fiscalia-de-la-nacion-se-definira-entre-tomas-galvez-y-patricia-benavides-hnews-86348)\n\n**Benue killings: Suspects plead not guilty to terrorism charges**\nNine suspects accused of involvement in the deadly Yelwata attack in Benue State, Nigeria, pleaded not guilty to a 57-count amended charge bordering on terrorism before the Federal High Court in Abuja on February 2, 2026. The charges, filed on January 20, 2026, stem from an alleged planning meeting between May and June 2025 in Nasarawa State to attack the Yelwata community, which resulted in approximately 150 deaths, house burnings, and grievous bodily harm on June 13, 2025. The prosecution, led by Attorney-General of the Federation Lateef Fagbemi (SAN) and Director of Public Prosecution Rotimi Oyedepo (SAN), withdrew the charge against the sixth defendant, Yakubu Mamman, and the earlier eight-count charge (FHC/ABJ/CR/471/2025). The court, presided over by Justice Joyce Abdul-Malik, ordered the amended charge read aloud with the aid of an interpreter and accepted the defendants' pleas of not guilty. The prosecution invoked Section 273 of the Administration of Criminal Justice Act, requesting an accelerated hearing and remand in custody. A bail application was made by Ibrahim Angulu but was directed to be filed formally. The prosecution announced plans to call eight witnesses. The trial is scheduled to commence on February 26 and 27, 2026, and the defendants were ordered remanded at the Kuje Correctional Centre pending trial.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 02:20 PM\nSource:[Punch Newspapers](https://punchng.com/?p=2052729)\n\n**\u2018I will not be intimidated\u2019: Jack Smith defends Trump investigations before House panel \u2022 Daily Montanan**\nOn January 24, 2026, former Justice Department Special Counsel Jack Smith testified before the U.S. House Judiciary Committee, defending his investigations into former President Donald Trump. Republicans, led by Chairman Jim Jordan, accused Smith of conducting a partisan probe targeting Trump ahead of the 2024 election, with Jordan claiming 'It was always about politics.' Trump, in a post on Truth Social during the hearing, suggested he would seek to prosecute Smith, prompting Smith to assert he would not be intimidated. Smith emphasized that his decisions were based solely on 'the facts and the law,' not political affiliation, stating, 'I made my decisions without regard to President Trump\u2019s political association... President Trump was charged because the evidence established that he willfully broke the law.' Smith led two federal prosecutions against Trump: one for conspiring to overturn the 2020 election results in D.C. federal court, and another for mishandling classified documents in Florida federal court. Both cases were dropped after Trump\u2019s 2024 election victory, in accordance with Justice Department policy prohibiting the prosecution of a sitting president. Democrats on the committee, including Vermont\u2019s Becca Balint and Maryland\u2019s Jamie Raskin, praised Smith\u2019s integrity, with Raskin affirming that Smith 'followed every applicable law, ethics rule and DOJ regulation.' Smith defended the collection of congressional phone records\u2014limited to metadata like call duration and time\u2014as necessary to investigate Trump\u2019s pressure campaign on lawmakers to object to the certification of the 2020 election results. He noted that if the president had been a Democrat, records from Democratic members would have been sought. Republicans criticized the secrecy of the record requests and the selective targeting of Republican records, but Smith maintained the process was lawful and nonpartisan. Democrats reiterated that Smith\u2019s work exemplified public service and set a standard for future legal and governmental professionals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 08:19 AM\nSource:[dailymontanan.com](https://dailymontanan.com/2026/01/23/repub/i-will-not-be-intimidated-jack-smith-defends-trump-investigations-before-house-panel/)\n\n**DOJ Now Seeks to Enlist 400 Attorneys to Epstein Docs**\nThe U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is mobilizing approximately 400 attorneys from its criminal and national security divisions, as well as U.S. attorneys\u2019 offices in Florida and New York, to review 5.2 million previously unreviewed pages of documents tied to Jeffrey Epstein, following the passage of the Epstein Files Transparency Act in November 2025. This effort, running from January 5 to January 23, 2026, builds on an initial team of nearly 200 lawyers and includes incentives such as telework and compensatory time. The DOJ missed the December 19, 2025, deadline for public release, citing the need to protect victim privacy and vet sensitive material. The expanded review follows the discovery of over a million additional documents in late December 2025, significantly increasing the volume beyond earlier estimates of 100,000 to 130,000 pages. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche emphasized an 'all-hands-on-deck' approach, with volunteers expected to review about 1,000 documents per day, dedicating three to five hours daily. The effort has raised concerns among current and former DOJ officials, as national security and criminal prosecutors are being diverted from ongoing immigration enforcement priorities. The review process has drawn scrutiny over redactions, including one involving a photo potentially linked to President Trump, which Blanche clarified was removed due to victim concerns, not political motives. Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer criticized the DOJ for delayed transparency, suggesting leaders were not fully forthcoming from the outset. The scale of the review surpasses prior large-scale declassification efforts, such as those related to the assassinations of JFK, RFK, and MLK, and highlights logistical challenges in complying with congressional mandates without additional staffing or funding. Bipartisan lawmakers have expressed frustration over missed deadlines and are threatening oversight, though the transparency law lacks explicit penalties.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: January 03, 2026 07:45 AM\nSource:[FrankNez Media](https://franknezmedia.com/doj-now-seeks-to-enlist-400-attorneys-to-epstein-docs/?utm_source=rss&#038;utm_medium=rss&#038;utm_campaign=doj-now-seeks-to-enlist-400-attorneys-to-epstein-docs)\n\n**U.S. Democracy Threat Index: $10,000 in Forecasting Prizes  --  LessWrong**\nA federal judge found probable cause that the Trump administration willfully defied a court order regarding deportation flights to El Salvador, intensifying a contempt probe that now seeks whistleblower and DOJ testimony on who authorized the flights and how the government responded. This case, along with related issues involving contempt referrals, DOJ follow-through, and the treatment of individuals sent to foreign prisons, is included in Metaculus's U.S. Democracy Threat Index\u2014a forecasting initiative developed with Bright Line Watch, a nonpartisan group of political scientists from Dartmouth and other institutions. The index tracks 39 observable indicators across six areas: electoral integrity, political rights, civil liberties, rule of law, institutional checks and balances, and information integrity. Each question forecasts whether a specific event will occur within a two-year window, with historical data backfilled for 2021\u20132024 to establish base rates. Current forecasting periods are 2025\u201326 and 2027\u201328. The index value is the average probability across all 39 questions, where higher values indicate greater predicted threat to democratic institutions and lower values indicate greater resilience. The index dynamically updates as new information emerges and forecasts are revised, offering real-time signal on institutional health. A $10,000 prize pool has been introduced to incentivize accurate predictions: $7,500 will be awarded based on forecast accuracy from December 12, 2025 onward, and $2,500 will be awarded based on periodic snapshots aligned with Bright Line Watch\u2019s surveys of political scientists and the American public. The first snapshot is scheduled for January 1, 2026, requiring forecasts to be submitted before that date.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 12, 2025 07:43 PM\nSource:[Maya Farber Brodsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Lmwhzi3cRdSEg6ZDe/u-s-democracy-threat-index-usd10-000-in-forecasting-prizes)\n\n**Judge Orders DOJ to Release Grand Jury Materials to Comey\u2019s Lawyers in 'Unusual' Case**\nOn November 17, 2025, U.S. federal judge William Fitzpatrick ordered the Department of Justice to disclose all grand jury materials related to the September indictment of former FBI Director James Comey. The judge cited serious errors and misconduct by the prosecution team led by acting U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan in Virginia\u2019s Eastern District, which he said threatened the integrity of the case. In a 24-page opinion, Fitzpatrick stated that the government\u2019s actions may have violated court orders and Comey\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights, and that these actions could constitute a reasonable basis to question whether the government\u2019s conduct was intentional or reckless. He concluded that due to events during the grand jury proceedings, there may be grounds to dismiss the charges. The ruling follows an earlier order requiring prosecutors to provide Comey\u2019s defense team with substantial investigative materials, which the defense argued had left them at a disadvantage due to lack of access to FBI leak investigation data. Comey, who has pleaded not guilty to lying to Congress in 2020, claims the prosecution is retaliatory and politically motivated under former President Trump\u2019s directive. Judge Fitzpatrick expressed personal concerns during a November 5 hearing, calling the case\u2019s procedure 'highly unusual' and suggesting the DOJ may have pursued a 'prosecute first, investigate later' approach. The indictment was brought by Lindsey Halligan, a former White House aide and Trump lawyer, who was recently appointed U.S. Attorney for Virginia. The case gained political attention after Trump publicly called for action against Comey and others on social media days before the indictment. The DOJ defended Trump\u2019s posts in court filings, arguing they reflected 'lawful prosecutorial motives' and not grounds for dismissal. The Department of Justice urged the court to reject the defense\u2019s claims, asserting that the record shows the prosecution was not solely aimed at punishing First Amendment rights. The judge\u2019s decision marks a significant development in a case widely seen as politically charged.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 08:57 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/gb/25/11/17/n14637808.htm)\n\n**Judge Orders DOJ to Release Grand Jury Materials to Comey's Lawyers Amid Procedural Concerns**\nOn November 17, 2025, U.S. federal judge William Fitzpatrick ordered the Department of Justice to disclose all grand jury materials related to the indictment of former FBI Director James Comey to his defense attorneys. In a 24-page opinion, the judge cited improper conduct by the Office of the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of Virginia, led by Acting U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan, which he said threatened the integrity of the prosecution and potentially violated Comey\u2019s Fourth Amendment rights. The judge stated that the government\u2019s actions\u2014possibly including a failure to comply with court orders\u2014could constitute grounds for dismissing the case, noting that 'there may be basis to question whether the government\u2019s conduct was intentional or reckless.' The disclosure order covers all grand jury materials from the September 2025 indictment. This follows a prior order in October requiring prosecutors to provide extensive investigative materials to the defense, as Comey\u2019s lawyers argued they were at a disadvantage due to lack of access to FBI leak investigation data. Comey, who denies charges of lying to Congress in 2020, claims the prosecution is retaliatory under former President Trump\u2019s direction. Judge Fitzpatrick expressed personal concern during a November 5 hearing, calling the case's procedural history 'highly unusual' and suggesting the DOJ may have pursued a 'prosecute first, investigate later' approach. The indictment was brought by Halligan, who recently became U.S. Attorney for Virginia. Days before the indictment, Trump posted on social media urging action against Comey and others. The DOJ defended the posts as reflecting 'lawful prosecutorial motivation,' not retaliation, and urged the court to reject the defense\u2019s claims. The case is tied to broader scrutiny of the 'Russia probe' and federal charges related to the FBI\u2019s handling of the matter.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 08:57 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/11/17/n14637808.htm)\n\n**DOJ must turn over materials to Comey due to possible 'missteps'**\nU.S. Magistrate Judge William Fitzpatrick ruled that prosecutors must turn over all materials to former FBI Director James Comey due to potential 'profound investigative missteps' during grand jury proceedings, which may have undermined the integrity of the indictment. Fitzpatrick emphasized that Comey's defense made a 'particularized and factually based' showing\u2014rare in criminal cases\u2014justifying the disclosure. The judge expressed concern that an FBI agent, aware of possible attorney-client privilege violations involving Comey\u2019s longtime associate Daniel Richman, still proceeded to testify before the grand jury. The order, issued on November 17, 2025, cited possible Fourth Amendment violations, exposure to privileged communications, and irregularities in the grand jury presentation. The ruling prioritized Comey\u2019s due-process rights over traditional grand jury secrecy. Comey, who pleaded not guilty to false-statement and obstruction charges tied to his 2020 congressional testimony, faces trial on January 5, 2026. Separately, U.S. District Judge Cameron Currie questioned the legality of interim U.S. Attorney Lindsey Halligan\u2019s rushed appointment, noting she had no prior prosecutorial experience and that a portion of her grand jury presentation\u2014between 4:28 p.m. and 6:30 p.m. on September 25\u2014was never transcribed. Currie questioned how Attorney General Pam Bondi could claim to have reviewed Halligan\u2019s full appearances if key materials were missing. Government lawyers argue the issues are clerical and urge the court to uphold the indictments. Both Comey and New York Attorney General Letitia James are seeking dismissal with prejudice, asserting the case was rushed by an unlawfully appointed prosecutor over internal objections. Currie expects to rule on Halligan\u2019s disqualification before Thanksgiving.

Smith, who resigned from the Department of Justice in January before President Trump's return to office, led two federal prosecutions against Trump\u2014on classified documents and election interference\u2014both of which were dropped after Trump's inauguration, in line with DOJ policy against prosecuting sitting presidents. A separate court ruling by U.S. District Judge Aileen Cannon declared Smith's appointment as special counsel unlawful. Smith stated that political considerations had no role in his prosecutorial decisions, recalling his time as chief of the Justice Department's Public Integrity Section and noting bipartisan service across administrations. His comments come amid growing political pressure: House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jim Jordan (R-OH) has demanded Smith testify by October 28, citing 'politically motivated investigations' and referencing an 'alarming document' found by FBI Director Kash Patel. The document allegedly shows that Smith's 'Arctic Frost' team subpoenaed phone records of eight Republican senators and one congressman in 2023, stored in a 'lockbox' within a secure FBI vault. Sen. Cynthia Lummis (R-WY), one of the affected lawmakers, called the revelation 'so dark that it shocks the conscience.' The U.S. Office of Special Counsel opened an investigation in August into whether Smith violated the Hatch Act. Smith's attorneys at Covington & Burling have dismissed the allegations as 'imaginary and unfounded,' asserting that all decisions were based on law and evidence. Smith also criticized recent DOJ actions under the Trump administration, including the dismissal of corruption charges against New York Mayor Eric Adams, calling it 'unprecedented' and stating, 'Nothing like it has ever happened that I've ever heard of.' The White House responded by asserting that the Trump administration 'will continue to deliver the truth to the American people while restoring integrity and accountability to our justice system.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 12:32 AM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2025/10/15/jack-smith-breaks-silence-in-london-as-gop-demands-testimony-on-trump-investigations/)\n\n**Trump officials shut down bribery probe of border czar Tom Homan**\nTom Homan, a former private citizen who was being considered for a top immigration role in the incoming Trump administration, was recorded in September\u202f2024 accepting a bag of $50,000 in cash from undercover FBI agents posing as businessmen. The Justice Department launched a bribery probe in the final months of the Biden administration, but the Trump administration shut it down in 2025, citing a lack of credible evidence and calling the investigation a 'political investigation.' White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson said the probe was 'blatantly political' and that Homan had not been involved in any contract award decisions. The case stemmed from an unrelated counter\u2011intelligence probe in which agents met a government\u2011contracting executive who offered $1\u202fmillion to Homan in exchange for a contract. The Public Integrity Section, which had been reduced from about 30 prosecutors to fewer than five, was involved in November\u202f2024. Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche and FBI Director Kash Patel said the review found no credible evidence of wrongdoing. Legal experts noted that the Supreme Court\u2019s 2016 decision on former Virginia governor Robert F. McDonnell raised the bar for prosecuting public officials, making it harder to bring charges against Homan. Jonathan Kravis, a former Public Integrity prosecutor, said the $50,000 recording should trigger a robust investigation to determine whether Homan would deliver on promises once in office. The DOJ has proposed permanently shrinking the Public Integrity Section, giving U.S. attorneys more authority over prosecutions of lawmakers and officials.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 07:47 PM\nSource:[The Detroit News](https://eu.detroitnews.com/story/news/nation/2025/09/21/trump-officials-shut-down-bribery-probe-of-border-czar-tom-homan/86281976007/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
