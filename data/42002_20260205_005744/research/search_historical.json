Consult with PIN\n  - Get PIN approval to take certain steps, issue certain legal process, file charges, or enter into plea agreements\n- **Rationale**: These requirements ensure consistency nationwide and provide subject matter expertise in nuanced areas, including constitutional issues like the speech or debate clause\n\n### Proposed Changes\n- **Recent reporting**: According to a Washington Post article over the weekend (prior to the podcast recording), the Justice Department is considering changes to consultation requirements with the Public Integrity Section\n- **Context**: Keller discussed \"proposed changes to the Public Integrity Section that could hamper the Justice Department's ability to investigate and prosecute corruption matters in a fair and impartial matter\"\n\n**Note**: The podcast transcript appears to be incomplete at the point where detailed discussion of the specific proposed changes would likely have occurred.\n\n### Source Reliability\n- **Primary source**: John Keller, former Chief of the Public Integrity Section at DOJ, now in private practice - highly reliable source with direct expertise\n- **Host**: James Pearce, Lawfare Legal Fellow, who also worked at PIN for a couple of years\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.justice.gov/jm/jm-9-85000-protection-government-integrity\">\n# Summary of DOJ Justice Manual Section 9-85.000 -

Obtain approval from PIN before bringing charges against members of Congress\n  2.

Conclude with present policy status.\nThis follow-up review revisits both segments of the user\u2019s request in light of the newest material that could be located on the open web.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nA.  Weekly Metaculus-community probability history for Question #38209\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 What was sought\u2003A table of the crowd forecast every calendar week through 5 Feb 2026, with any week-over-week swing \u2265 5 percentage-points (pp) highlighted.\n\n\u2022 What the new search found\u2003No additional trace of a machine-readable time-series, an export utility, or even a cached scrape for Q #38209 surfaced. The terms \u201cMetaculus GraphQL question 38209\u201d and variants produced only unrelated job boards and generic GitHub pages (search result 1). A focused attempt to locate a \u201chistory\u201d page via Google\u2019s in-URL search (site:metaculus.com \"history\" \"38209\") also returned zero hits.\n\n\u2022 Outcome\u2003The gap identified earlier remains: without the underlying datapoints, no week-by-week table (and therefore no flagging of \u2265 5 pp jumps) can be produced from publicly available sources. The only practical ways to fill the gap would be:\n  1. Log in to Metaculus and manually hover-record each point on the interactive chart\u2014impractical for 100+ weeks;\n  2. Obtain authorised access to Metaculus\u2019 internal GraphQL endpoint;\n  3. Locate a third-party archival scrape that has not yet appeared in any search results.\n\n\u2022 Additional information still needed\u2003A raw probability series or an authorised API endpoint for Metaculus question #38209.\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nB.  2024-2026 DOJ communications, leaks, or press reports on ending the Public Integrity Section (PIN) \u201cconsultation\u201d rule\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe fresh search retrieved three primary, citable pieces of evidence:\n\n1. 15 Nov 2023 \u2013 Deputy Attorney General Lisa Monaco memorandum that actually increased consultation requirements for investigations involving Members of Congress (Ballard Spahr client alert summarising the memo). Status: rule reinforced, not ended. (Ballard Spahr, 15 Nov 2023)\n\n2. 19 May 2025 \u2013 Bloomberg Law story: DOJ officials confirm that provisions in the Justice Manual mandating PIN approval are \u201cunder review\u201d and that \u201cno final decisions have been made.\u201d (Bloomberg Law, 19 May 2025)\n\n3. 22 Sep 2025 \u2013 NOTUS report citing an internal Justice Manual draft: \u201cThe consultation requirement is suspended while revisions are ongoing.\u201d (NOTUS, 22 Sep 2025)\n\nThese are fully sourced inside the current result set.  Other elements mentioned in the earlier draft (CNN 14 Feb 2025, AP/NBC 12 Mar 2025, PBS October 2025, House Judiciary 21 Jan 2026) still look plausible but cannot be re-verified because they are not present in the latest search returns.  They should therefore be treated as unconfirmed until fresh URLs can be captured.\n\nChronology (only items verifiable from current search results are footnoted)\n\u2022 15 Nov 2023 \u2013 Monaco memo tightens PIN oversight (reinforces rule) [Ballard Spahr].\n\u2022 19 May 2025 \u2013 DOJ spokesperson tells Bloomberg Law the Department is \u201creviewing\u201d whether to end mandatory PIN approval; no decision yet [Bloomberg Law].\n\u2022 22 Sep 2025 \u2013 NOTUS publishes leaked draft of Justice Manual: language now says \u201cconsultation requirement is suspended\u201d (de jure suspension) [NOTUS].\n\u2022 No subsequent 2026 press release, Federal Register notice, or Justice Manual revision could be located that reinstates, abolishes, or otherwise amends the suspension.\n\nCurrent policy status (as of 5 Feb 2026)\n\u2022 De jure\u2003Justice Manual language shown in the 22 Sep 2025 leak (\u201csuspended while revisions are ongoing\u201d) is the most recent verifiable text.\n\u2022 De facto\u2003Press coverage (NOTUS piece, Bloomberg Law interviews) and anecdotal reports indicate that U.S. Attorney\u2019s Offices are proceeding without seeking PIN sign-off.\n\u2022 Official certainty\u2003Absent a public DOJ directive dated after 22 Sep 2025, the policy is best characterised as \u201cformally suspended, final disposition pending.\u201d\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nC.  Remaining information gaps\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n1.  Metaculus probability time-series remains unavailable\u2014critical for Part A.\n2.  Documentary proof (press release, Justice Manual update, or legislative record) later than 22 Sep 2025 that either finalises or reverses the suspension.\n3.
