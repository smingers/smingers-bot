## Analysis of 2-Year Treasury Yield Forecast for February 12, 2026

### (a) Source Analysis

**High-Quality Financial Data Sources:**

1. **FRED/YCharts Data (Feb 4, 2026)**: Most recent official data showing 3.57% on Feb 4. This is the gold standard - direct from Department of Treasury via FRED API. Factual, no opinions.

2. **Hexun.com (Feb 4, 2026, 11:17 PM)**: Reports 2-year yield fell 0.82 basis points to 3.5614% at close of Feb 4 trading. Chinese financial news aggregator citing market data. Factual reporting, aligns closely with FRED data.

3. **MoneyDJ (Feb 3, 2026)**: Reports 2-year yield at 3.568% on Feb 3, down less than 1 basis point. Taiwan-based financial news. Factual market data.

**Economic Context Sources:**

4. **ISM Manufacturing Data (Feb 3, 2026)**: Multiple sources report January 2026 ISM Manufacturing PMI at 52.6, significantly exceeding expectations of 48.4. This is strong evidence of economic resilience, which typically supports higher yields. Factual data from official source (ISM).

5. **Schwab Outlook (2026)**: **Opinion piece** by Kathy Jones and Collin Martin projecting Fed funds rate at 3.0-3.5% over next year, with 10-year yields potentially not falling below 3.75%. Expert opinion but dated to broader 2026 outlook, not specific to Feb 12.

6. **J.P. Morgan Predictions**: **Speculative opinion** suggesting "realistic surprise" of sub-3% yields across curve. Explicitly labeled as low-probability scenario (1-in-3 chance). Weak evidence for near-term forecast.

7. **Kevin Warsh Fed Chair Speculation**: Multiple sources (InstaForex, Economic Times) discuss market reaction to potential Warsh appointment as Fed Chair, described as "hawkish." This is **speculative** - Warsh is nominated but not confirmed, and his actual policy stance is uncertain. Moderate evidence for upward yield pressure.

**Recent Market Dynamics:**

8. **October 2025 Government Shutdown**: Historical context showing yields rose during shutdown (2-year at 3.574% on Oct 3). Yields subsequently declined through late 2025/early 2026. Past event, limited predictive value for Feb 12.

9. **Treasury Refunding Announcement (Feb 4, 2026)**: U.S. Treasury offering $125 billion in securities, with auctions Feb 10-12. The 30-year auction on Feb 12 could create volatility. **Factual and highly relevant** - supply dynamics matter.

### (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Current level stability at 3.56-3.57%** (multiple independent sources confirm Feb 2-4 clustering): Suggests strong near-term anchor
- **ISM Manufacturing surprise (52.6 vs 48.4 expected)**: Reduces recession fears, typically supports higher yields. However, impact may already be priced in by Feb 4 data
- **Treasury auction schedule (Feb 10-12)**: Direct structural factor that could create volatility on resolution date

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Warsh nomination speculation**: Markets pricing in more hawkish Fed stance, but timing/confirmation uncertain
- **Recent downtrend stabilization**: 50bp decline from Oct to Feb suggests market found equilibrium around 3.55-3.60%
- **Fed policy pause**: No FOMC meeting until late February, reduces likelihood of major policy surprises

**Weak Evidence:**
- **J.P. Morgan "surprise" predictions**: Explicitly low-probability scenarios
- **Broad 2026 outlooks**: Too long-term for 7-day forecast
- **Past government shutdown effects**: Different context, limited relevance

### (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe: 7 days (Feb 5-12, 2026)**

This is an extremely short forecast window. Key considerations:

- **If halved to 3-4 days**: Would narrow distribution significantly. Recent 3-day stability at 3.57% suggests very tight range (3.55-3.60%) would be appropriate. Confidence in status quo would increase.

- **If doubled to 14 days**: Would widen distribution considerably. More time for economic data releases (employment, inflation), Fed speaker commentary, and auction digestion. Would expand 10th-90th range from ~25bp to ~40bp.

**Critical timing factor**: The Feb 12 resolution date coincides with the 30-year Treasury auction. Auction results and market digestion could create intraday volatility, though 2-year yields typically show less auction sensitivity than longer maturities.

### (d) Justification and Distribution Calibration

**Compelling factors shifting from outside view:**

1. **Auction timing (Feb 12)**: Creates potential for elevated volatility on resolution date itself. However, 2-year yields are less sensitive to long-end supply than 10-year or 30-year yields.

2. **Recent stability plateau**: Three consecutive days at 3.57% is stronger evidence of near-term anchor than typical. Suggests market consensus around current levels.

3. **ISM data already digested**: The strong manufacturing data was released Feb 3, and yields by Feb 4 show it's been absorbed. No major data releases scheduled before Feb 12 that would rival ISM's importance.

4. **Warsh speculation**: Provides modest upward bias, but effect likely already reflected in current levels.

**Distribution reasoning:**

- **Central tendency (40th-60th)**: Should cluster tightly around 3.55-3.59% given recent stability
- **Modest moves (20th-40th, 60th-80th)**: Account for normal daily volatility and auction effects: 3.50-3.55% and 3.59-3.65%
- **Tail scenarios (10th, 90th)**: 
  - 10th percentile (~3.45%): Would require unexpected risk-off event or very weak data
  - 90th percentile (~3.72%): Would require hawkish Fed surprise or inflation shock

**Adjustment from outside view**: My outside view had 10th-90th range of 3.47-3.70% (23bp spread). Given:
- Stronger recent stability than initially assessed
- ISM data already priced in
- No major scheduled catalysts before Feb 12

I'm tightening the distribution slightly, with 10th-90th range of 3.48-3.70% (22bp spread), centered at 3.57%.

### Forecasting Checklist

1. **Target variable**: 2-year constant maturity Treasury yield on Feb 12, 2026, in percent units

2. **Outside view base rate**: 3.55-3.58% central range based on recent 2-week stability pattern

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 3.57%; mean ≈ 3.58%. This aligns with current market levels and recent stability - sensible.

4. **Key evidence pieces**:
   - Feb 2-4 clustering at 3.57% (factual, high quality)
   - ISM Manufacturing at 52.6 already digested (factual, moderate impact)
   - Treasury auction on Feb 12 (factual, creates volatility risk)
   - Warsh hawkish speculation (speculative, modest upward bias)
   - No major data releases before Feb 12 (factual, supports stability)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Unexpected geopolitical crisis or financial stress event (e.g., banking sector issue) could trigger flight-to-quality, pushing yields down 15-25bp. This would make my forecast look too high. Conversely, surprise hawkish Fed communication could push yields up 10-15bp.

### Final Calibration

Given the 7-day window, recent stability, and limited scheduled catalysts, I'm anchoring to current levels with moderate tails:

- Strong central clustering around 3.57%
- Asymmetric slight upward bias from Warsh speculation
- Wider downside tail for risk-off scenarios
- Upper tail accounts for hawkish surprises and auction volatility
