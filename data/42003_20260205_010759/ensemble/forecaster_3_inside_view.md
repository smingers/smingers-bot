## (a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; fact vs opinion)

1) **U.S. Treasury “Daily Treasury Yield Curve Rates” (methodology page; references Feb 4, 2026)**
- **What it is (fact):** Explains how CMT yields (including 2-year) are constructed from indicative bid-side quotes around ~3:30pm ET using a spline.
- **Quality:** Very high (official methodology), but **not a forecast** and not a direct quote for Feb 12.
- **Use:** Confirms what DGS2 measures and why it can differ slightly from an on-the-run 2-year note quote.

2) **Schwab fixed income outlook (Dec 2025)**
- **What it is (opinion):** Macro view: expects further Fed cuts over “next year,” curve steepening; short rates drift down as labor weakens.
- **Quality:** Medium-high (reputable shop), but it’s a **broad horizon** view; weak for a 1-week forecast.
- **Use:** Establishes a medium-term downward bias risk for 2-year yields if markets reprice toward more cuts.

3) **J.P. Morgan “realistic surprise predictions for 2026” (date not shown here; refers to 2y=3.53 on 2026-01-29)**
- **What it is (opinion with scenario):** Assigns ~1/3 probability to a “flat sub-3% out to 10y” surprise scenario requiring multiple policy actions.
- **Quality:** High as a scenario note, but explicitly **not base case**; also not near-term timing.
- **Use:** Helps define a **left-tail** (lower-yield) scenario, but unlikely to fully play out within 7 days.

4) **CNBC (Jan 9, 2026)**
- **What it is (fact + some commentary):** Provides contemporaneous yields (2y ~3.53) and links moves to jobs data / rate-cut pricing.
- **Quality:** Medium-high for market color and point-in-time quotes; not a direct input for Feb 12, but consistent with the “mid-3.5s” regime.

5) **AskNews / market-yield wrap articles (Feb 2–Feb 4, 2026)**
- **Hexun (Feb 4):** **Fact**: 2y ~3.5614% at NY close. Quality medium (secondary reporting), but consistent with others.
- **MoneyDJ (Feb 3):** **Fact**: 2y ~3.568%. Adds **opinion** from BMO’s Ian Lyngen about range-bound February. Quality medium-high.
- **Economic Times / other syndications (Feb 2–Feb 3):** **Facts**: strong ISM manufacturing surprise; 2y around 3.57%; discussion of Fed leadership uncertainty. Quality mixed (often syndicated), but the **data direction** matches multiple sources.
- **Irish Independent (Jan 23):** **Fact**: short yields rose as cut expectations pushed back. Quality medium.
- **Investing.com (Feb 4) refunding announcement:** **Fact**: auction schedule (Feb 10–12) and Treasury financing/bill-supply guidance; buyback intentions. Quality medium-high (newswire style).
- **Use:** Best “inside view” inputs: current level (≈3.56–3.57) + near-term catalysts (data surprises, auctions, shutdown-related data delays).

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

### Strong evidence (larger shifts)
1) **Multiple independent sources put the 2-year yield ~3.56–3.57 on Feb 3–4** (Hexun, MoneyDJ, broader market reporting).  
**Implication:** Anchor distribution near **3.56–3.58** going into Feb 12.

2) **Strong ISM Manufacturing surprise (52.6 vs ~48 expected) cited across sources** with immediate yield back-up/rate-cut repricing.  
**Implication:** Mild **upside** pressure vs a purely “stable/range-bound” base rate.

### Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
3) **Treasury refunding auctions Feb 10–12 + cash/bill-supply guidance** (Investing.com).  
**Mechanism:** Auctions mostly affect term premium/long-end more than 2-year, but can move rates via risk sentiment and dealer balance sheet around supply.  
**Implication:** Slightly **wider** near-term distribution (more two-sided volatility) rather than a big level shift.

4) **BMO (Lyngen) “range-bound in February” framing** (MoneyDJ).  
**Implication:** Supports **no large trend move** over a week absent a new shock.

### Weak evidence (small adjustments)
5) **Fed chair speculation / “hawkish vs dovish” narratives** in syndicated pieces.  
**Implication:** Raises uncertainty a bit, but unclear timing/mechanism for a discrete repricing exactly by Feb 12.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Forecast horizon:** From **2026-02-05 to 2026-02-12** (about **7 calendar days / ~5 trading days**).
- **If halved (~3–4 days):** I’d tighten the interval and stick even closer to 3.56–3.58 (less time for repricing).
- **If doubled (~2 weeks):** I’d widen meaningfully; there’d be more room for macro data, Fed communication, or risk-off/risk-on swings to move the 2-year by **25–40 bps**.

---

## (d) Justification (how I adjust the outside view)
**Outside-view baseline provided** (centered ~3.57 with a fairly tight weekly range).

**Adjustments:**
- **Slight upward tilt** to the central tendency because the latest notable macro surprise (ISM) pushed markets toward **fewer/ later cuts**, which typically lifts the 2-year.
- **Slightly wider dispersion** than the tightest “quiet week” assumption because the Feb 10–12 auction cycle and shutdown-related data timing issues can create noisier trading, even if they don’t change the fundamental 2-year anchor.

Net: keep the distribution centered in the **mid–high 3.5s**, with modestly fatter tails than the most tranquil weeks.

## Quick checklist (abbreviated)
1) **Target:** DGS2 value (percent) for **2026-02-12**.  
2) **Outside view used:** Prior base distribution centered ~**3.57**.  
3) **Consistency:** Implied median ≈ **3.58–3.59**, mean ≈ **3.59** — consistent with “mid-3.5s, mild upside risk.”  
4) **Top evidence (<=20 words each):**
   - Current 2y ≈ **3.56–3.57** on Feb 3–4 across multiple sources.
   - **ISM manufacturing upside surprise** reduced near-term cut expectations.
   - **Range-bound** expectation from BMO; no clear imminent Fed decision in-window.
   - **Refunding auctions** may widen short-term volatility slightly.
5) **Blind spot:** A sudden risk-off shock or unexpectedly weak delayed labor data could drop 2y **20–40 bps** quickly.
