“FRED series DGS2 closing value (percent) for Thursday 12 February 2026.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Source analysis (facts vs. opinions, quality, date)

1. Hexun/Stock Channel 05 Feb 2026 – factual intraday closes: 2-yr 3.561 %, 10-yr 4.278 %. Chinese newswire, same-day quote, high quality for level check; no opinions used.

2. MoneyDJ 03 Feb 2026 – factual closes: 2-yr 3.568 %, 10-yr 4.265 %. Includes strategist comment “range-bound in February” (opinion, moderate weight).

3. CNBC 09 Jan 2026 – factual snapshot 2-yr 3.532 %. Strategist remarks on labour softness (opinion, weak for one-week horizon).

4. Schwab 2026 Fixed-Income Outlook (Dec 2025) – forward-looking view that 2-yr drifts lower with future Fed cuts. Longer-term opinion, moderate quality.

5. J.P. Morgan “Realistic Surprise 2026” (Dec 2025) – scenario of sub-3 % flat curve, labelled 1-in-3 surprise. Long-term, speculative; weak for one-week horizon.

6. U.S. Treasury methodology page – authoritative description of how DGS2 is built; confirms comparability of market quotes to eventual FRED print.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong
• Present level ≈ 3.56 % confirmed by two independent real-time wires (Hexun, MoneyDJ).  
• One-week historical volatility of the 2-yr in 2025-26 regime ≈ 7–10 bp; four-year history shows < 25 bp moves in 95 % of weeks.

Moderate  
• Near-term macro calendar light (no FOMC until March); delayed payrolls could move front end ±10-15 bp.  
• Auctions 10–12 Feb usually nudge yields only a few bp.

Weak  
• Medium-term outlook pieces (Schwab, J.P. Morgan) imply lower yields but on multi-month horizon.  
• Headlines about Fed chair nomination/PMI strength already in price.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon = 7 calendar days (5 trading days). Halving horizon (≈ 2 trading days) would shrink 80 % interval to about ±10 bp; doubling (≈ 14 days) would widen it to about ±25 bp around the median.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate: persistence at current level with σ ≈ 10 bp per week → median 3.56 %, 80 % range 3.41–3.71 %.

Inside-view tweaks:  
• Payroll report could surprise; given recent upside in PMI and hawkish tone, balance of risks a shade higher.  
• Treasury refunding supply also leans mild upward.  
Shift distribution +2 bp and fatten tails slightly.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Forecasting checklist  
1. Variable aligned? Yes—DGS2 close, 12 Feb 2026, percent.  
2. Outside-view base 3.56 % preserved, only +2 bp shift.  
3. Implied median ≈ 3.56 %; mean ≈ 3.57 % – consistent with rationale.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Current DGS2 ≈ 3.56 %.  
   • One-week σ ≈ 10 bp, historic tail < 25 bp.  
   • No Fed meeting before 12 Feb.  
   • Possible payroll surprise/auction pressure bias upward a few bp.  
5. Blind-spot: Huge payroll miss + recession panic could drive 2-yr below 3.30 % quickly (down-side risk).
