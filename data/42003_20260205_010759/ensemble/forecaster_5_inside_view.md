FORECASTING CHECKLIST  
1. Target variable: FRED series DGS2 daily close (percent), reading dated 2026-02-12.  
2. Outside-view base rate (2010-2025, when DGS2 between 3 %–4 %): 1-week mean change 0 bp, σ ≈ 8 bp.  
3. Consistency check: implied median = 3.59 %; mean ≈ 3.59 %. Matches rationale of small, slightly upward drift.  
4. Key evidence (20 words each):  
   • Current level 3.56 % (Feb 4 quotes); low volatility week ahead.  
   • CPI release Feb 10 historically moves 2-yr ~±10-15 bp.  
   • Up-beat ISM & Warsh nomination nudging yields higher last three days (+6 bp).  
   • Fed on hold; futures imply <5 bp policy change risk before Feb 12.  
   • Option-implied 1-week σ ≈ 10 bp, matching historical 18 bp (5-day).  
5. Blind-spot: major geopolitical shock pushing investors to safety would drive yield under 3.2 % (downside).

----------------------------------------------------------
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)  
1. Hexun 2026-02-04: factual EOD Treasury quotes (2-yr 3.561 %). Reliable; mirrors Bloomberg data.  
2. Investing.com 2026-02-04: Treasury refunding details. Factual, official press release; neutral on yields.  
3. MoneyDJ 2026-02-03: CNBC quote recap (2-yr 3.568 %). Reliable facts, some strategist opinion (“range-bound”).  
4. CNBC 2026-01-09: December payrolls, yields 3.532 %. Timely history.  
5. Schwab outlook 2025-12-23: forecast of gradual Fed cuts; quality buy-side research, moderate relevance.  
6. J.P. Morgan “realistic surprise” 2025-12: scenario of sub-3 % flat curve (1-in-3 prob.). Forward-looking, but speculative.  
7. Other October 2025 CNBC pieces: older level data; now background only.  
Overall only #1–3 supply fresh hard numbers; #5–6 supply structured but speculative opinions.

(b) Evidence weighing  
Strong: #1 and #3 independent, agreeing on current 3.56 % level; Fed schedule—no meeting—structural.  
Moderate: CPI on 10 Feb has proven historical ±15 bp influence; auction schedule (#2) adds supply pressure.  
Weak: JPM surprise scenario (<3 %)—long horizon, conditional; Schwab long-term steepening.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time until print: 5 trading days. Halving (2-3 days) would tighten σ to ≈ 6 bp; doubling (10 days) widens to ≈ 25 bp and would encompass FOMC minutes and PPI, increasing uncertainty modestly.

(d) Justification / inside‐view adjustment  
Base: 3.56 % with σ 10 bp.  
Upward forces (ISM beat, supply, hawkish Warsh chatter) add ≈ +3 bp to mean.  
Downward forces (possibility of soft CPI, safe-haven flows) roughly symmetric but seem slightly less probable short-term.  
Resulting μ ≈ 3.59 %, σ kept at 10 bp but inflate tails 20 % for unknowns → 90 % range about ±23 bp.
