Analysis:
The value of the two-year Treasury yield on 12 Feb 2026 will mainly be driven by:
• How investors update their expectations for the timing and size of the first Fed rate cuts after the 31 Jan FOMC meeting.  
• Incoming U.S. macro data between now and 12 Feb (January CPI due 13 Feb, January jobs data just released on 6 Feb, ISM, consumer inflation expectations, etc.).  
• Supply factors such as this week’s 3-, 10- and 30-year auctions and the 2-year auction scheduled for 24 Feb (guides demand cues).  
• Global risk sentiment and liquidity (e.g., equity sell-offs or safe-haven bids).  
To get an inside view I need very recent articles/data releases that discuss movement in the 2-year yield since 29 Jan (last FRED datum = 3.53 %), traders’ positioning, and fresh Fed commentary. That information is most likely found in financial press, wire services, and the H.15/FRED updates for the days 30 Jan–5 Feb as well as previews for the CPI release.
