Analysis:
This question asks for the daily 2-year Treasury constant-maturity yield that the Federal Reserve will publish for 12 February 2026.  Although the ultimate value will depend on market conditions on that specific business day (and on how the Treasury’s curve-fitting procedure converts observed yields into the constant-maturity series), the best outside-view information comes from:
• Recent behaviour of the 2-year yield (level, trend, and volatility) in the weeks leading up to 5 February 2026.  
• How quickly the yield has moved after recent FOMC meetings and major macro releases (jobs report on 2 Feb 2026, CPI release on 10 Feb 2026, etc.).  
• Typical day-to-day standard deviation for the DGS2 series (≈6–10 bp over the last quarter).  
Collecting those data will let us build a simple statistical distribution centred on the latest available value (3.53 % on 29 Jan) and widened based on recent volatility and any fundamental news scheduled before 12 Feb.
