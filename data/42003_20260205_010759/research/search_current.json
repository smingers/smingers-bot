Morgan\n\n## Key Relevant Information for the Question\n\n**Prediction #1: The U.S. Treasury yield curve is flat out to the 10-year maturity point at a sub-3% yield**\n\nThis is the most relevant prediction to the question about 2-year Treasury yields on 2026-02-12.\n\n### Specific Details:\n- J.P. Morgan assigns at least a 1-in-3 probability to this scenario (their threshold for \"realistic surprise\" predictions)\n- Currently (as of article publication), the 2-year yield remains inverted to the fed funds rate\n- For this scenario to materialize, the following combination must occur:\n  - The Fed cuts rates to near neutral (2.5%\u20133%) as inflation continues to normalize\n  - The Fed begins expanding its balance sheet in the next year by buying U.S. Treasury bills\n  - The Treasury Department limits long-end supply and increases bill funding\n  - Motivation: administration's goal of improving housing affordability through lower mortgage rates\n\n### Context from 2025 Review:\n- The article notes that in 2025, the yield curve steepened\n- The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield now trades modestly above the fed funds rate\n- The 2s10s curve is sloping upwards by more than 60 bps\n- Background data mentioned: As of 2026-01-29, the 2-year yield was at 3.53%\n\n## Other Predictions (Less Directly Relevant):\n- Gold reaching $5,000/ounce\n- U.S. dollar (DXY) reaching new cycle high\n- U.S. high yield spreads reaching record lows\n- Emerging market sovereign bonds with negative spreads to Treasuries tripling in size\n\n**Note:** These are described as \"realistic surprise predictions\" with at least 1-in-3 probability, not base case forecasts from J.P. Morgan.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/03/us-treasury-yields-government-shut-down-reaches-third-day-.html\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Treasury yields rise even after the release of weaker-than-expected U.S. services data\"\n\n**Source:** CNBC  \n**Date:** October 03, 2025  \n**Authors:** Sean Conlon, Sawdah Bhaimiya\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Treasury Yields (as of article date -

This issuance is expected to raise $34.8 billion in new cash from private investors. The securities include a $58 billion 3-year note maturing February 15, 2029, a $42 billion 10-year note maturing February 15, 2036, and a $25 billion 30-year bond maturing February 15, 2056. Auctions will be held on February 10 (3-year), February 11 (10-year), and February 12 (30-year), all on a yield basis and settling on February 17, 2026. The Treasury plans to maintain current auction sizes for nominal coupon and Floating Rate Notes (FRNs) for the next several quarters, and TIPS auction sizes will remain unchanged through the February to April 2026 quarter. Bill issuance will remain near current levels into mid-March, with incremental reductions ahead of the April 15 tax deadline, leading to a projected $250\u2013300 billion net decline in total bill supply by early May. The Treasury General Account is estimated to peak at $1,025 billion (\u00b1$50 billion) by late April before declining in May, assuming a $850 billion cash balance at the end of March. Additionally, the Treasury plans to purchase up to $38 billion in off-the-run securities for liquidity support and up to $75 billion in the 1-month to 2-year range for cash management. On January 14, the Treasury issued a notice of proposed rulemaking to expand direct buyback access to additional counterparties based on auction participation; the comment period closes on February 13, 2026. The Treasury also plans to transition buyback operations to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York\u2019s FedTrade Plus platform, conducting a small-value test buyback to support the transition.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 03:04 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-treasury-to-offer-125-billion-in-securities-for-february-refunding-93CH-4485377)\n\n**Treasury and Finance Ministry Issues 2 Billion Euro Bond**\nThe Ministry of Treasury and Finance announced the issuance of a 2 billion euro, 8-year maturity bond. The issuance, conducted under the country's external financing program for the year, was entrusted to Deutsche Bank, HSBC, JP Morgan, and Societe Generale on February 3, 2026, and concluded the same day with a final amount of 2 billion euros. The funds were credited to the Ministry\u2019s accounts on February 10, 2026. The bond, maturing on March 10, 2034, carried a coupon rate of 5.15% and a yield of 5.2%, with approximately 6.5 billion euros in demand received. The yield, at around 'MS+242' basis points, marked the lowest spread in the last 15 years for euro-denominated issuances. This issuance extended the euro yield curve beyond the previous longest maturity (August 2031) by approximately 2.5 years. Demand came from around 180 investors, with 56% of the bond allocated to investors in the United Kingdom, 24% to other European countries, 9% to the United States, 6% to the Middle East, 4% to Turkey, and 1% to other countries. The final allocation was predominantly foreign investors. This issuance brought total international capital market financing for 2026 to approximately 5.9 billion US dollars.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 09:44 AM\nSource:[Star.com.tr](https://www.star.com.tr/ekonomi/hazine-ve-maliye-bakanligindan-2-milyar-avroluk-tahvil-ihraci-haber-1995117/)\n\n**U.S. Treasury Yields Consolidate Amid Wait for Key Signals - MoneyDJ Financial News**\nOn February 3, 2026, U.S. Treasury yields showed a consolidating trend in New York bond markets. According to CNBC quotes, the 2-year Treasury yield declined by less than 1 basis point to 3.568%, the 10-year yield dropped over 1 basis point to 4.265%, and the 30-year yield fell by more than 1 basis point to 4.896%. Bond prices and yields move inversely. The U.S. Institute for Supply Management (ISM) reported that the January 2026 ISM Manufacturing PMI rose to 52.6, significantly exceeding the market expectation of 48.4 and returning to the expansion zone above 50 for the first time in 11 months, signaling a notable rebound in U.S. manufacturing sentiment. BMO Capital Markets' U.S. interest rate strategist Ian Lyngen stated in a recent report that investors are awaiting the next key signal, and the U.S. bond market may remain range-bound in February until clearer direction emerges. Additionally, the January non-farm employment report, originally scheduled for release on February 6, was delayed due to the partial U.S. government shutdown, adding short-term uncertainty to the market.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 11:16 PM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=1c3361d8-4266-42a1-b21f-9f8bf8240d97)\n\n**MinHacienda Places $900 Billion in Short-Term Securities at 12.683% Rate Amid High Inflation Expectations**\nThe Ministry of Finance and Public Credit (MinHacienda) successfully placed $900.000 billion in short-term government securities (TCOs) with a maturity date of January 26, 2027, in a new auction. The auction received bids totaling $2.6 trillion in nominal value, representing 2.9 times the amount offered, and a cut-off rate of 12.683% for the one-year reference. This strong demand indicates continued investor confidence in Colombia's short-term public debt. However, the high interest rate reflects investors' demand for a significant premium to compensate for inflationary risks and fiscal tightness. Analysts anticipate inflation will be 30 basis points above December 2025 levels, and the central bank's recent 100 basis point increase in the policy rate underscores its cautious stance to bring inflation back to target. Despite the high demand, the elevated rate shows that financing remains costly for the government. The TCO program is part of the national strategy to develop the domestic capital market by introducing liquid reference points in the short end of the yield curve.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 10:02 PM\nSource:[Diario La Rep\u00fablica](https://www.larepublica.co/economia/minhacienda-coloco-900-000-millonesen-titulos-de-corto-plazo-y-a-una-tasa-de-12-6-4318783)\n\n**US Treasury & Euro bond yields rises while US stock market is down today - here's what investors need to know**\nOn February 3, 2026, rising US and European bond yields pressured global financial markets, with the US 10-year Treasury yield reaching 4.29%, its highest level since August 2024, according to a Finimize report. This increase weighed on growth stocks, particularly technology shares, contributing to a decline in the Nasdaq. The rise in yields reduced the present value of future earnings, making high-growth equities less attractive, as explained by Finimize. Investor sentiment shifted toward value-oriented assets less sensitive to interest rate changes. Company-specific disappointments further pressured the market: Gartner's shares fell after reporting weak adjusted earnings and a downbeat 2026 outlook, while PayPal declined due to missed revenue guidance and results. In the euro zone, government bond yields rose, with Germany\u2019s 10-year yield increasing by 2.6 basis points to 2.89%, per Devdiscourse. This movement was influenced by US Treasuries and speculation surrounding Kevin Warsh\u2019s potential appointment as Federal Reserve chair. Warsh\u2019s advocacy for rate cuts and balance sheet reduction could lead to a steeper yield curve and wider long-end swap spreads, according to Commerzbank\u2019s Christoph Rieger. Additional euro zone factors included tighter corporate credit access and lower-than-expected inflation in France. Despite a slight rise in US consumer confidence to 48.8 from 47.2, it remained below the 50 threshold for the sixth consecutive month, signaling ongoing household caution. These developments underscore bond markets' central role in shaping equity performance and investor sentiment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 08:40 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/us-treasury-euro-bond-yields-rises-while-us-stock-market-is-down-today-heres-what-investors-need-to-know/articleshow/127894254.cms)\n\n**US 10-Year Yield Approaches 5-Month High | Forex News 2026.02.03 (en)**\nThe yield on the 10-year US Treasury note rose above 4.29%, approaching the five-month high of 4.3% recorded on January 20, 2026. This increase followed new data from the Institute for Supply Management (ISM) showing an unexpected recovery in the US manufacturing sector. The rise in yields is also attributed to investor shifts away from Treasury securities due to renewed strength in the precious metals market, prompting major exchanges to raise margin requirements for open positions. Market participants are closely assessing the potential monetary policy direction under incoming Federal Reserve Chairman Kevin Warsh, who is viewed as an inflation hawk. Warsh previously opposed expanding the Federal Reserve\u2019s balance sheet during the global financial crisis, contributing to a widening of the US yield curve earlier in February 2026. Fixed-income investors are now evaluating how Warsh might influence the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) this year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 03:59 PM\nSource:[InstaForex](https://www.instaforex.com/forex-news/2885287)\n\n**Stronger-Than-Expected Economic Data Boosts Optimism, Weighs on U.S. Treasuries as Yields Rise 4BP**\nU.S. January ISM Manufacturing Index rose to 52.6, exceeding expectations of 48.5 and marking the first expansionary reading in nearly a year, according to data released on February 2, 2026. The increase, driven by strong growth in new orders and production\u2014both reaching their fastest pace in nearly four years\u2014signaled robust economic momentum. As a result, U.S. Treasury bonds weakened, with yields rising 4 basis points (BP) across the curve. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield reached 4.28%, and the 2-year yield stood at 3.57% by the close of the New York session. FWDBONDS Chief Economist Chris Rupkey attributed the surge in business confidence to the fading impact of the federal government shutdown and potential import tariffs. The Federal Reserve, in its recent statement, removed the 'downside risks to employment' warning, signaling improved economic prospects and suggesting that further rate cuts may be delayed. Despite the positive data, ISM Chairman Susan Spence cautioned that seasonal factors\u2014such as post-holiday inventory rebuilding\u2014and preemptive procurement due to anticipated tariffs could be influencing the results. Market participants expect the U.S. Treasury to maintain its current debt issuance plan, with the next quarterly refinancing auction set at $125 billion, a figure unchanged since May 2024\u2014the longest uninterrupted period since the mid-2010s. Although Treasury Secretary Bessent previously hinted at favoring longer-term bond issuance, high yields have reduced the appeal of this strategy. Market debate centers on whether the Treasury will delay increasing medium- and long-term issuance until 2027 or even reduce the issuance of the longest-dated bonds to mitigate upward yield pressure. The platform, Xinhua Finance (China Financial Information Network), emphasizes that its content does not constitute investment advice.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 01:25 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202602033639559290.html)\n\n**Is the U.S. Treasury a true safe-haven amid volatile stock markets and shifting Fed leadership? With 10-year yields at 4.27%, how safe are Treasurys?**\nOn February 2, 2026, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields surged to 4.275%, while the 30-year yield reached 4.903%, driven by a sharp rise in the ISM Manufacturing PMI to 52.6\u2014well above the expected 48.4\u2014marking the first expansion in over 26 months. This data signaled a faster-than-expected rebound in U.S. industrial activity, reducing expectations for near-term Federal Reserve rate cuts. Concurrently, President Trump\u2019s nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve Chair intensified market concerns, as Warsh is known for his 'hawkish' stance on the Fed\u2019s $6.6 trillion balance sheet and has historically opposed aggressive monetary expansion. Markets now anticipate a 'bear steepening' of the yield curve, where long-term yields rise faster than short-term ones, reflecting expectations of tighter financial conditions and prolonged inflation risks. Despite the U.S. Treasury\u2019s traditional status as a safe-haven asset, yields are rising\u2014not falling\u2014indicating that investors are reacting to strong economic data and policy uncertainty rather than risk aversion. Short-term yields (e.g., 2-year at 3.567%) remain elevated, while long-term yields are sensitive to fiscal policy, inflation pressures (e.g., 0.7% monthly producer price increase in December), and balance sheet runoff expectations. The market is pricing in two conflicting scenarios: eventual rate cuts if growth slows, and sustained high rates due to balance sheet discipline. Investors are now closely monitoring upcoming labor data\u2014JOLTS job openings and ADP employment report\u2014to assess whether economic momentum will persist. While Treasurys remain default-free, their price volatility has increased, making them safer than equities but more volatile than in past cycles.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 06:28 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/is-the-u-s-treasury-a-true-safe-haven-amid-volatile-stock-markets-and-shifting-fed-leadership-with-10-year-yields-at-4-27-how-safe-are-treasurys/articleshow/127866980.cms)\n\n**Govt bond yields surge to one-year high, rupee rebounds on RBI support**\nGovernment bond yields in India surged to a one-year high of 6.77% on February 2, 2026, following the Union Budget announcement of gross borrowing at Rs 17.2 trillion for FY27\u2014higher than the market\u2019s expected range of Rs 16\u201316.5 trillion. The 10-year benchmark bond yield rose by seven basis points, driven by concerns over elevated borrowing supply, with Nomura projecting weekly gross supply at Rs 37,000 crore, up from Rs 31,000 crore, assuming 47 auctions. State borrowing is expected at Rs 12.75 trillion, though risks point to a higher figure due to slower central consolidation. Despite soft inflation and an easing bias in interest rates, bond market participants expect yields to remain elevated between 6.60% and 7.00%, with limited room for decline without explicit central bank support. The Indian rupee rebounded by 0.5%, settling at 91.52 per dollar, its strongest single-day gain since December 19, 2025, supported by Reserve Bank of India (RBI) dollar sales and mid-tenor buy/sell swaps to manage volatility. The RBI\u2019s intervention helped cushion rupee liquidity and prevent spillover stress into the foreign exchange market. Market participants now await the upcoming Monetary Policy Committee meeting for further cues. Government securities worth Rs 5.5 trillion are set to mature in FY27, and the RBI\u2019s estimated Rs 1 trillion in government securities may enable bond switches to mitigate liquidity drain. The government plans to issue Rs 1.3 trillion in Treasury bills.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 01:31 PM\nSource:[Business Standard](https://www.business-standard.com/markets/news/govt-bond-yields-surge-to-one-year-high-rupee-rebounds-on-rbi-support-126020201164_1.html)\n\n**Positive US economic data pushes back rate-cut expectations**\nPositive US economic data, including strong job market performance and robust consumer spending, has led traders to expect that the Federal Reserve will delay interest-rate cuts until later in 2026. Short-maturity Treasury yields, which reflect market expectations for Fed rate changes, rose significantly: the two-year note increased by more than 3 basis points to 3.62%, the highest level since December 10. In contrast, thirty-year Treasury yields remained largely unchanged and were near their starting level for the year. These shifts indicate growing market confidence in sustained economic strength, reducing near-term expectations for rate cuts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 23, 2026 05:30 AM\nSource:[Irish Independent](https://www.independent.ie/business/world/positive-us-economic-data-pushes-back-rate-cut-expectations/a1352944635.html)\n\n**Market Premium For 10-Year Yield Holds Near Fair Value Estimate**\nThe market premium for the US 10-year Treasury yield remains near a fair value estimate, according to three models analyzed by CapitalSpectator.com. As of January 14, 2026, the 10-year yield was trading approximately 22 basis points above fair value in December 2025, the lowest level in three years. This reflects a continued shift from the elevated market premium seen during 2022\u20132024, signaling a reversal of the sharp rise in the premium. Historically, the yield\u2019s valuation cycle tends to revert toward zero (neutral), suggesting that the current slight premium implies a neutral stance on maturity risk for bond market strategies. In contrast, a higher allocation to maturity risk was recommended in late 2023 when the market premium peaked above 120 basis points. Since then, the 10-year yield has declined and the bond market has rallied. While future cycles are not guaranteed, the recurrence of this pattern\u2014described as 'rhyming'\u2014makes betting against it a high-risk assumption.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 06:45 PM\nSource:[The Capital Spectator](https://www.capitalspectator.com/market-premium-for-10-year-yield-holds-near-fair-value-estimate/)\n\n**Market Premium for 10-Year Yield Holds Near Fair Value Estimate | Investing.com UK**\nThe market premium for the US 10-year Treasury yield remains near fair value, according to CapitalSpectator.com's average of three models, with the current estimate showing the yield trading approximately 22 basis points above fair value in December 2025\u2014close to the lowest level in three years.

US treasury 10-year yield nears 2025 high relative to two-year | Stock Market News**\nThe 10-year US Treasury yield reached a nine-month high relative to the two-year yield, briefly exceeding it by more than 72 basis points on January 6, 2026, marking the first time since April 2025. This yield-curve steepening reflects market expectations of further Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts in 2026, driven by anticipated economic softening and a resurgence in corporate bond issuance. The two-year yield stood at approximately 3.47%, while the 10-year yield was around 4.18%. Gregory Faranello of AmeriVet Securities noted the yield spread could widen to a full percentage point this year, the widest since 2021, as long-term yields remain pressured higher by corporate debt sales. The market-implied expectation for a quarter-point cut by mid-2026 and another by year-end remained stable, though Fed Governor Stephen Miran stated more than a full percentage point of cuts are needed. Meanwhile, other Fed officials have advocated pausing cuts due to persistent inflation above the 2% target and accommodative financial conditions. A low probability of a rate cut on January 28, the next scheduled Fed decision, was assigned by traders. Additional factors included soft demand in a 10-year Japanese government bond auction, which lifted yields in Japan, and a rally in European government bond markets due to benign German regional inflation data.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 06, 2026 05:20 PM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/market/bonds/key-milestone-us-treasury-10-year-yield-nears-2025-high-relative-to-twoyear-11767719053583.html)\n\n**US bond market faces a more challenging road ahead in 2026**\nUS bond investors are expected to face a more challenging environment in 2026 after a stellar performance in 2025, driven by a 75 basis point cumulative Federal Reserve rate cut, a resilient economy, and strong corporate earnings. These factors boosted bond prices and kept credit risks low, resulting in broad bond indices posting over 7% total returns in 2025 \u2014 the best performance since 2020. The Morningstar US Core Bond Total Return Index gained more than 7%, while investment-grade bonds delivered nearly 8% returns, supported by credit spreads near multi-decade lows (around 80 basis points). However, expectations for 2026 are more muted: traders are pricing in only about 60 basis points of rate cuts, slower than in 2025. Fiscal stimulus measures, including potential tax and spending initiatives, could support growth and keep longer-term yields elevated. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell by over 40 basis points in 2025 to around 4.1%, but major banks forecast they will end 2026 at or slightly above current levels. A divergence may emerge, with shorter-maturity yields declining further while longer-term yields could rise due to stronger growth or higher government debt, pressuring long-duration bond returns. Asset managers are becoming cautious on duration, favoring shorter-dated securities. Credit spreads may widen in 2026 due to increased corporate borrowing, especially from large tech firms, potentially reducing returns for investment-grade and high-yield bonds. While some analysts expect a stronger bond rally if inflation eases and growth slows, requiring aggressive Fed cuts, the overall outlook points to steadier, harder-earned returns compared to the exceptional gains of 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 31, 2025 05:06 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/us-stocks/news/us-bond-market-faces-a-more-challenging-road-ahead-in-2026/articleshow/126264115.cms)\n\n**10-Year Treasury ETF (511260) Sees Over 1 Billion Yuan Net Inflows in 20 Days, Capitalizing on Bond Market Trading Opportunities**\nThe 10-year Treasury ETF (511260) has seen net inflows exceeding 1 billion yuan over the past 20 days, positioning investors to capture short-term trading opportunities in the bond market. According to Xiangcai Securities, the Chinese bond market is expected to remain in a volatile state in 2025. Although the U.S. Federal Reserve\u2019s 2025 rate cuts have narrowed the U.S.-China interest rate differential, China\u2019s monetary policy remains focused on domestic conditions, with interest rates already at historically low levels and limited room for further declines. The domestic economic fundamentals are unlikely to improve significantly in the short term, leading to a forecast that the 10-year Treasury yield will remain in a range of 1.5% to 2% in 2026. With the 1-year deposit rate around 1%, further rate cuts are constrained, while increased government bond supply and earlier issuance are expected to alleviate the 'asset shortage' situation. As a result, a sustained bull market in bonds in 2026 is unlikely, prompting a strategic shift from 'buy and hold' to tactical trading to exploit short-term market disruptions. The 10-year Treasury ETF (511260) tracks the SSE 10-year Treasury Index, selecting government bonds with 7 to 10 years remaining maturity listed on the Shanghai Stock Exchange, maintaining a constant duration. Since its inception, the ETF has consistently achieved new net asset value highs, with strong historical performance: a 4.17% return over the past year, 14.04% over three years, 23.39% over five years, and a cumulative return of 35.77% since launch. Notably, the ETF has posted positive annual returns across all seven full calendar years since its 2017 inception, making it a potential tool for long-term asset allocation. Risk disclosures state that historical performance is not indicative of future results, and investors should review fund documents to understand risk profiles and suitability. The ETF\u2019s performance data from 2017 to 2025H1 shows mixed results relative to its benchmark, with returns ranging from -1.55% to 9.02% and benchmark returns from -1.01% to 8.09%.

The immediate trigger was rising credit risks at regional banks and the government shutdown, which delayed economic data releases. This marks the second wave of risk-off sentiment since October, following a prior surge driven by trade tensions. Market expectations indicate the Federal Reserve will cut rates by 25 basis points on October 29, 2025, with further easing likely over the next year; the terminal rate is now expected to fall below 3%, with multiple additional cuts possible before 2026. The 'anchor' role of U.S. Treasuries has reemerged, contrasting sharply with the bond market sell-off in April caused by Trump-era tariffs. Morgan Stanley and Bloomberg strategists note that 4% has become a critical yield threshold, suggesting the market may enter a prolonged phase of yields below 4%. Morgan Chase anticipates further downward pressure on bond yields, while AmeriVet Securities warns that worsening credit conditions could drive the 10-year yield even lower. Investors are closely watching the upcoming CPI data, with expectations of a flat core CPI and a headline inflation rate of 3.1%, above the Fed\u2019s 2% target\u2014potentially constraining yields in the short term. This rally resembles the risk-off surge following the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank collapse and contrasts with the April tariff-driven correction. The U.S. government shutdown continues, delaying multiple economic reports, and the Fed is scheduled to meet on October 28\u201329, 2025.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 19, 2025 11:51 PM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8nb77uysMcY)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
