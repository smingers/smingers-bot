The page references data as of **Wednesday, February 4, 2026**.\n\n### Treasury Par Yield Curve Rates (Constant Maturity Treasury rates - CMTs):\n\n1. **Methodology**: Yields are interpolated by the Treasury from the daily par yield curve using a monotone convex spline method\n2. **Data Source**: Based on closing market bid prices obtained by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York at or near 3:30 PM each trading day\n3. **Important Note**: These are indicative, bid-side market price quotations (not actual transactions)\n4. **Maturities Covered**: Fixed maturities at 1, 1.5, 2, 3, 4, and 6 months and 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 10, 20, and 30 years\n5. **Negative Yields Policy**: The derived par yield curve for Treasury nominal CMT series will be floored at zero, even if input prices correspond to negative yields\n\n### Contact Information:\n- For questions about these statistics: Office of Debt Management at debt.management@do.treas.gov\n- For other Public Debt information: (202) 504-3550\n\n### Additional Context:\nThe article also provides historical information about various Treasury rate series and explains methodologies for Treasury Bills, Real Yield Curves (TIPS), and other rate calculations.\n\n**Disclaimer**: The web content extraction appears to be incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence at the end.

Series existence and coverage  \n   \u2022 The official FRED series page for DGS2 shows the series running from 1 June 1976 through at least 3 February 2026 (fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS2) \u2013 well beyond the dates the user needs.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, the data definitely exist inside FRED for every business day in the requested period.\n\n2.  Mechanism to obtain the full block of data  \n   \u2022 The FRED API \u201cseries/observations\u201d endpoint allows an observation_start and observation_end to be specified in one call (fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/).  \n   \u2022 An example that exactly matches the needed window appears in the search results:  \n     https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=DGS2&observation_start=2025-10-01&observation_end=2026-02-29&file_type=csv&api_key=YOURKEY.  \n     Supplying a free FRED API key will return a CSV file that already contains the two required columns (date, value) for all business days in the range.\n\n3.  Evidence that the numeric values for late January / early February 2026 sit in the mid-3\u00bd percent area  \n   \u2022 Isolated quotes: 3.575 % on 28 Jan 2026 and 3.576 % on 2 Feb 2026 were captured in a CNBC price table (CNBC snippet, result list item 2).  \n   \u2022 ALFRED shows 3.52 % on 30 Jan 2026 and 3.57 % on 3 Feb 2026 (fred.stlouisfed.org/alfred).  \n   \u2022 Morningstar\u2019s \u201cData Talk\u201d cites 3.558 % for 4 Feb 2026.  \n   These scattered points confirm the series\u2019 level but account for only a handful of the roughly 108 business days in the period.\n\n4.  Nothing in the search results provides the complete daily table.  \n   \u2022 The HTML table visible on the FRED site in the search snippet is an excerpt from 1976 entries and does not include 2025-26 rows.  \n   \u2022 No other result reproduces the full 2025-10-01 to 2026-02-29 slice.\n\n5.  API documentation and version confirm feasibility  \n   \u2022 A St. Louis Fed blog post announcing \u201cFRED API Version 2\u201d (research.stlouisfed.org, 4 Nov 2025) reiterates that bulk downloads are supported.  \n   \u2022 The API Quick Guide in the FRED documentation shows the same parameters required for the user\u2019s call.\n\nHow far we can go right now\n\n\u2013 Because the search results do not include the CSV itself, we cannot paste the requested 100-plus daily rows into the answer, nor can we calculate statistics (high, low, mean, start-to-end change) that would make a credible narrative summary.  \n\u2013 We can, however, state with confidence that the data exist and can be retrieved in one step once anyone (you or the end-user) authenticates to the FRED API or uses the \u201cDownload \u00bb Custom\u201d button on the DGS2 series page.\n\nRemaining information gap\n\n1.  The actual list of observations for every business day between 1 Oct 2025 and 29 Feb 2026 (approximately 108 rows).  \n2.  Derived descriptive statistics that depend on the full set:  \n   \u2022 Highest yield in the window (exact date and value)  \n   \u2022 Lowest yield in the window  \n   \u2022 Average yield over the window  \n   \u2022 Net change from first to last observation  \n   \u2022 Any notable intra-period swings\n\nWithout the full dataset these cannot be computed accurately.\n\nRecommended next step (actionable)\n\nA.  Acquire the data (takes <30 seconds once a key is in hand)  \n   1. Create or log in to a free FRED account and request an API key (instructions in the \u201cQuickstart Guide\u201d at frb.readthedocs.org).  \n   2. Run the call:  \n      https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?  \n        series_id=DGS2&observation_start=2025-10-01&observation_end=2026-02-29&file_type=csv&api_key=YOURKEY  \n      \u2013 The returned CSV will look like:  \n\n        date,value  \n        2025-10-01,4.06  \n        2025-10-02,4.05  \n        \u2026  \n        2026-02-03,3.57  \n\n   3. If an API key is not convenient, visit the FRED DGS2 page, click \u201cDownload Data\u201d, choose \u201cCustom\u201d, enter the same start and end dates, and download the CSV manually.\n\nB.  Produce the deliverables  \n   \u2022 Paste the content of the CSV (minus the header) into the answer.  \n   \u2022 Compute simple statistics (max, min, mean, first-last difference) in a spreadsheet or with a few lines of code.  \n   \u2022 Write a 3-4 sentence synopsis, e.g.:  \n     \u201cDuring the period the 2-year Treasury yield began around 4.06 % (1 Oct 2025), traded as high as 4.18 % on 11 Oct 2025, slipped steadily through November and December, and finished at 3.57 % on 3 Feb 2026, roughly a 50 bp decline. The average yield over the span was 3.79 %, with the low of 3.49 % recorded on 24 Jan 2026.\u201d\n\nOnce those steps are done the user\u2019s request is fully met.\n\nConclusion\n\n\u2022 All tooling and documentation needed to satisfy the request are identified and linked.  \n\u2022 The substantive content (complete daily observations) has not yet been fetched; until that is done the \u201crecent levels\u201d narrative cannot be finalised with numeric precision.  \n\u2022 No further web search is likely to uncover the full CSV; direct retrieval from FRED is both faster and more reliable than hunting for a secondary site.  \n\nNo additional searches are required\u2014the path to the missing information is now entirely procedural.\n\nVerification checklist  \n1. Analysis section formatted correctly \u2013 yes.  \n2. No \u201c</Agent_report>\n"
