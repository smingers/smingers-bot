Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Web Articles (January 28-30, 2026):**
- WBRC.com, AP News, ABC7, Click2Houston, KHOU: All mainstream news outlets reporting Charles Victor Thompson's execution on January 28-29, 2026. These are factual reports with consistent details: Thompson, 55, was executed by lethal injection at 6:50 PM CST in Huntsville, Texas, for the 1998 murders of Glenda Dennise Hayslip and Darren Keith Cain. He was the first U.S. execution of 2026.
- Death Penalty Information Center: Authoritative database confirming execution date as January 28, 2026 (note: some sources say January 29 due to reporting timing, but execution occurred evening of January 28).
- Quality: High. These are verifiable facts from reputable sources. Opinions from victims' families and prosecutors are clearly attributed but don't affect core facts.

**AskNews Articles (February 2-5, 2026):**
- Multiple articles about unrelated people named "Charles Thompson" or "Victor Thompson":
  - Charles R. Schwab (stock trading, February 4)
  - Victor Ekpong Thompson (Nigerian fraud case, February 2-4)
  - Travis Thompson (Bicycle Therapeutics CFO appointment, February 3)
  - Victor from Star Academy France (reality TV, February 2)
  - Charles Nelson (New Era Energy appointment, February 2)
  - Charles Dayot (French mayor investigation, February 2-3)
- **Critical Finding:** Only ONE article directly mentions Charles Victor Thompson: TMZ (January 29) and Newsweek (January 29) covering his execution, plus several Spanish/German language sources from January 29.
- **Key Observation:** After January 29, there are ZERO new articles about Charles Victor Thompson in the AskNews feed. All subsequent articles with similar names are different people.

**Google Trends Data Provided:**
- Current value (Feb 1, 2026): 6
- Question states verification will use data from 2026-01-13 to 2026-02-12
- Resolution compares Feb 5 value to Feb 12 value (±3 point threshold)

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Execution finality**: Multiple independent sources confirm Thompson was executed on January 28-29, 2026. This is an irreversible event with no possibility of reversal or new legal proceedings. (Causal: execution = end of story)
2. **Media cycle complete**: AskNews search from Feb 2-5 shows ZERO articles about Charles Victor Thompson, only unrelated people with similar names. This demonstrates the news cycle has moved on entirely.
3. **Typical execution news decay pattern**: Historical pattern shows execution news spikes on day-of/day-after, then rapidly decays to baseline within 7-14 days. We are now 7-8 days post-execution.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **No scheduled catalysts**: No documentaries, appeals, or related events are scheduled (per outside view analysis noting case is closed).
2. **Current low baseline**: Value of 6 on Feb 1 is already near the 90-day mean of 2.2, suggesting decay is nearly complete.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Random fluctuation at low values**: Google Trends values at 0-10 can fluctuate due to noise, but typically stay within small ranges.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction Window:** February 5 to February 12, 2026 (7 days)
- This is 8-15 days post-execution
- Historical pattern shows most decay occurs in first 7 days; by day 8-15, values stabilize near baseline

**If timeframe halved (3.5 days):** Would still expect "Doesn't change" as we're already in the stable baseline period. Shorter window = less chance of any movement.

**If timeframe doubled (14 days):** Would still expect "Doesn't change" but slightly higher chance of minor fluctuation (e.g., value dropping from 2 to 0 or rising to 4-5 due to random noise). Still within ±3 threshold.

**(d) Justification:**

The outside view established a 93% probability for "Doesn't change" based on:
- 90% base rate of ±3 point changes in 7-day windows
- Being 8 days post-event in decay phase
- Current value (2-6 range) near baseline

**Current information strongly reinforces this view:**

1. **Zero new media coverage**: The AskNews search definitively shows no articles about Charles Victor Thompson after January 29. This is strong evidence the news cycle is complete.

2. **Case closure is absolute**: Unlike ongoing trials or appeals that could generate new interest, an execution is final. There is no mechanism for renewed interest unless an entirely unexpected event occurs (e.g., new documentary announcement, which would typically be pre-promoted and isn't mentioned anywhere).

3. **Name confusion in search results**: The fact that searches for "Thompson" or "Victor" now return unrelated people suggests even residual search interest has dissipated.

4. **Timeline alignment**: We're exactly in the expected 7-14 day post-spike stabilization window where values should remain near baseline.

**Adjustment to outside view:**
The current evidence is even stronger than the base rate suggests because:
- We have direct confirmation of zero media activity (not just absence of evidence, but evidence of absence)
- The finality of execution removes any possibility of new legal developments
- We're past the typical news cycle duration

However, I should be cautious about overconfidence:
- Google Trends at low values (0-10) can have measurement noise
- A single unexpected article or social media event could cause a small spike
- The ±3 threshold is relatively narrow when current value is 2-6

**Calibration:**
"Increases" (value >8 on Feb 12, if current is ~5): Would require unexpected new coverage. Given zero articles in past week and case finality, this is very unlikely. Estimate: 3-5%

"Decreases" (value <-1 from Feb 5): Technically impossible since values can't be negative. If we interpret this as dropping to 0-1 (more than 3 points below a Feb 5 value of 5), this is possible but unlikely given recent stability. Estimate: 5-7%

"Doesn't change" (within ±3): This encompasses values from 0 to ~8 on Feb 12. Given current range of 2-6 and no catalysts, this is highly probable. Estimate: 88-92%

Probability calibration:

Starting from outside view: Increases 5%, Doesn't change 93%, Decreases 2%

**Adjustments based on current information:**
- Zero new articles is strong confirmatory evidence for stability → increase "Doesn't change" confidence slightly
- Case finality removes upside risk → decrease "Increases" slightly  
- Low baseline value creates floor effect (can't go much lower) → increase "Decreases" slightly to account for measurement noise

**Blind spot consideration:**
The main blind spot would be an unexpected media event (new documentary announcement, viral social media post, related crime). However, such events typically have advance indicators (production announcements, marketing), which are absent. The probability of a truly unexpected viral event is low (<5%).

Another consideration: Google Trends measurement noise at low values. The ±3 threshold might be breached simply due to rounding or sampling variation, not actual search volume changes. This creates some uncertainty but doesn't favor any particular direction.

**Final calibration:**
Given the strong confirmatory evidence and low probability of surprises, I'm adjusting to:
- Increases: 4% (down from 5% due to zero new coverage)
- Doesn't change: 91% (down from 93% to account for measurement noise risk)
- Decreases: 5% (up from 2% to account for possible drop to 0-1 range due to noise)

Checklist:
1. Options: Increase (>3 points higher on Feb 12 vs Feb 5), No change (±3 points), Decrease (>3 points lower). Timeline: Feb 5-12.
2. Base rate: 93% no change, 5% increase, 2% decrease. Current analysis confirms this strongly.
3. Consistency: Most likely = Doesn't change (91%); Least likely = Increases (4%). Makes sense given execution finality and zero new coverage.
4. Key evidence: (1) Zero articles about CVT after Jan 29, (2) Execution finality = no new developments possible, (3) 8 days post-event in stable baseline period, (4) Current value 2-6 near historical mean 2.2.
5. Blind spot: Unexpected viral social media event or documentary announcement could spike interest, but no indicators of this. Would shift ~5% from "Doesn't change" to "Increases."
6. Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100.

Probabilities: [4, 91, 5]
