Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:

**Web Articles (All dated January 27-30, 2026):**
- FOX 4 News, NBC News, USA Today, Click2Houston, Houston Public Media, Texas DOJ: All reputable mainstream news sources providing factual coverage of Thompson's execution on January 28-29, 2026. These sources consistently report the same facts: Thompson was executed for the 1998 murders of Dennise Hayslip and Darren Cain. The execution occurred and was the first U.S. execution of 2026.
- Key factual information: Thompson was executed on January 28, 2026, at approximately 6:50 PM CT. This was a high-profile case due to his escape in 2005 and Netflix documentary coverage.
- Opinions present (from victims' families, prosecutors) but core facts are verifiable and consistent across sources.

**Agent Report (dated through February 5, 2026):**
- Comprehensive legal and media analysis confirming Thompson's execution on January 28, 2026
- Key finding: "As of February 2026 there are no active or pending legal proceedings in any court, and media coverage has shifted from real-time updates to historical retrospectives"
- Conclusion: "the matter of Charles Victor Thompson is closed from both judicial and news perspectives"
- Quality: Thorough, well-cited, distinguishes facts from speculation

**Google Trends Data:**
- Shows massive spike on January 29, 2026 (value: 100) - the day after execution
- Rapid decay: Jan 30 (26), Jan 31 (7), Feb 1 (6), Feb 2 (3), Feb 3 (2), Feb 4 (1), Feb 5 (2)
- Current value on Feb 5: 2
- 90-day base rate: 90% of 7-day windows show change ≤3 points

(b) Reference Class Analysis:

**Possible Reference Classes:**
1. **Google Trends for executed death row inmates**: Most relevant. Execution news creates immediate spike followed by rapid decay to baseline within 5-10 days.
2. **Google Trends for one-time news events (non-recurring)**: Suitable. Shows similar pattern of spike and decay.
3. **General Google Trends volatility for low-volume search terms**: Less suitable but informative about noise at low values.

**Selected Reference Class:** Executed death row inmates' Google Trends patterns. This is most directly applicable as Thompson's case fits this exactly. The pattern shows:
- Massive spike on execution date/day after
- Rapid exponential decay over 7-14 days
- Return to baseline (near-zero) within 2 weeks
- Minimal chance of secondary spikes unless new developments occur

(c) Timeframe Analysis:

**Prediction Window:** February 5, 2026 to February 12, 2026 (7 days)
**Current Status (Feb 5):** Value is 2, already 8 days post-execution
**Historical Pattern from Data:**
- Jan 29 (peak): 100
- Jan 30: 26 (74-point drop)
- Jan 31: 7 (19-point drop)
- Feb 1: 6 (1-point drop)
- Feb 2: 3 (3-point drop)
- Feb 3: 2 (1-point drop)
- Feb 4: 1 (1-point drop)
- Feb 5: 2 (1-point increase)

The decay curve has already flattened significantly. We're now in the "noise floor" range (0-3) where values fluctuate minimally around baseline.

**Key Observation:** The Agent report confirms no new legal proceedings, documentaries, or media events are scheduled. The case is definitively closed.

(d) Justification:

Thompson's execution on January 28, 2026, created a predictable Google Trends spike that peaked on January 29 (value: 100). By February 5, the value has already decayed to 2, which is consistent with the 90-day mean of 2.2. 

The question asks about change between Feb 5 (current value: 2) and Feb 12 (7 days later). Given:

1. **No catalysts for renewed interest:** The execution is complete, all legal proceedings are closed, and no new media events are scheduled
2. **Typical decay pattern:** One-time news events return to baseline within 2 weeks; we're already 8 days post-event
3. **Noise floor reached:** At value 2, we're at the historical baseline where random fluctuations are minimal
4. **Base rate data:** 90% of 7-day windows show changes ≤3 points
5. **Recent stability:** Feb 1-5 shows values hovering between 1-6, with the trend settling toward baseline

The most likely scenario is the value remains at or very close to 2 (within ±3 points), qualifying as "Doesn't change." A decrease below -1 (to negative values, which is impossible) or an increase above 5 would both require unexpected new developments, which the Agent report indicates are not forthcoming.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate shows 90% probability of change ≤3 points in 7-day windows. However, this base rate includes all periods, including the spike period. For periods already at baseline (like our current situation), stability is even more likely.

Given:
- We're 8 days post-event (well into decay phase)
- Current value (2) equals long-term mean (2.2)
- No scheduled catalysts
- Recent 5-day trend shows values between 1-6

The probability distribution should heavily favor "Doesn't change" (within ±3 of current value 2, meaning range 0-5 on Feb 12).

"Increases" (>5 on Feb 12) would require: unexpected news coverage, documentary release, or related event. Probability: ~5%

"Decreases" (<-1, effectively 0 since negative impossible) is technically impossible, but values could drop to 0-1. However, this still falls within the ±3 range of "Doesn't change." True decrease (value dropping more than 3 points below 2, to <-1) is impossible. Probability: ~2%

"Doesn't change" (value 0-5 on Feb 12): ~93%

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 5%
Doesn't change: 93%
Decreases: 2%
