## (a) Source Analysis

**News Articles (FOX 4, NBC News, USA Today, KPRC, Houston Public Media):**
All sources are reputable mainstream media outlets covering the Charles Victor Thompson execution story. The key factual consensus across all sources:
- Thompson was executed on January 28, 2026 (some sources say January 29 due to time zone differences, but execution occurred evening of January 28)
- He was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m. CT
- This was the first U.S. execution of 2026
- He was convicted of killing his ex-girlfriend Dennise Hayslip and her boyfriend Darren Cain in 1998
- He had a notable 2005 jail escape

These are high-quality, contemporaneous sources documenting a completed event. The opinions expressed (from victims' families, prosecutors) are clearly attributed and don't affect the factual timeline.

**Texas Department of Criminal Justice Summary:**
Official government record providing basic facts about Thompson's case. High reliability for factual information.

**Agent Report:**
Comprehensive synthesis dated February 5, 2026, confirming that Thompson's execution occurred on January 28, 2026, and that "as of February 2026 there are no active or pending legal proceedings." The report notes media coverage has "shifted from real-time updates to historical retrospectives" and "tapers off to historical summaries by early February." This is crucial: the agent report explicitly states there are no new developments in February 2026.

**Google Trends Data:**
Shows actual search interest data with a massive spike on January 29 (value: 100) following the execution on January 28. The trend shows:
- Peak: January 29 (100)
- January 30: 26
- January 31: 7
- February 1: 6
- February 2: 3
- February 3: 2
- February 4: 1
- February 5: 2

This represents a classic "news event decay" pattern where interest spikes dramatically during a major event then rapidly declines.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Search interest for executed death row inmates (7-day post-execution windows):** This is highly relevant. Execution stories typically generate a brief spike in media coverage on the execution date, followed by rapid decay as the story becomes "old news." There are no ongoing legal proceedings, trials, or appeals to sustain interest.

2. **Search interest decay patterns following major criminal justice news events:** Broader but applicable. Shows similar rapid decline patterns after the precipitating event concludes.

3. **General Google Trends behavior for individuals after a major life event concludes:** Very broad but captures the fundamental dynamic.

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** #1 - Search interest for executed death row inmates in the week following execution. This is the most specific and relevant class. The execution has already occurred (January 28/29), and we're now 7-8 days past the event. The question asks about February 5-12, which is 8-15 days post-execution.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 7 days (February 5 to February 12, 2026)

**Current Position in Timeline:**
- Execution: January 28, 2026 (8 days ago from February 5)
- Peak interest: January 29, 2026 (value: 100)
- Current value (Feb 5): 2

**Historical Pattern from Google Trends Data:**
Looking at 7-day windows in the 90-day dataset:
- 90% of 7-day periods show change ≤3 points ("Doesn't change")
- 7% show increases >3 points
- 2% show decreases >3 points

**Specific Recent Trajectory:**
The decay from the execution spike follows a clear exponential decline:
- Day of execution (Jan 28): 39
- Peak (Jan 29): 100
- Jan 30: 26 (74% decline)
- Jan 31: 7 (73% decline)
- Feb 1: 6 (14% decline)
- Feb 2: 3 (50% decline)
- Feb 3: 2 (33% decline)
- Feb 4: 1 (50% decline)
- Feb 5: 2 (100% increase but from very low base)

The value has essentially returned to baseline (pre-execution levels were 0-1). By February 5, we're at value 2, which is near the 90-day mean of 2.2.

## (d) Justification

**Key Factors:**

1. **Event Completion:** The execution occurred January 28, 2026. This was a terminal event - there are no future court dates, appeals, or legal proceedings. The agent report explicitly confirms "no active or pending legal proceedings" and media coverage has shifted to "historical retrospectives."

2. **Natural News Cycle Decay:** We're now 8 days past the execution. The Google Trends data shows interest has already decayed from 100 (Jan 29) to 2 (Feb 5). This represents a 98% decline and return to baseline.

3. **No Catalysts for Renewed Interest:** The agent report found no scheduled documentaries, follow-up investigations, or other media events in February 2026. The only mention of Thompson in popular culture was a 2018 Netflix episode, not anything new.

4. **Baseline Stability:** Looking at the pre-execution period (Jan 1-27), values were consistently 0-4, with most days at 0. The current value of 2 is consistent with this baseline. The 90-day mean is 2.2.

5. **Statistical Base Rate:** In 90% of 7-day windows over the past 90 days, the change was ≤3 points. Given we're starting at value 2 (near baseline) with no catalysts, the statistical expectation strongly favors "Doesn't change."

6. **Verification Date Consideration:** The question will resolve based on the value on February 12, which is 15 days post-execution - well into the "forgotten news" phase.

Outside view calibration:

**Calibration Considerations:**

1. **Base Rate Anchoring:** The Google Trends data provides a strong empirical base rate: 90% of 7-day windows show ≤3 point changes. However, this includes the execution spike period. Looking specifically at baseline periods (when values are 0-4), stability is even higher.

2. **Current State:** Starting value on Feb 5 is 2. For "Doesn't change" to resolve true, the Feb 12 value must be within [−1, 5] range (2±3).

3. **Asymmetric Risk Assessment:**
   - **Increase >3 (to 6+):** Would require a new catalyst. Agent report found none. The execution story is "old news." Very low probability.
   - **Decrease >3 (to negative):** Impossible since Google Trends minimum is 0. To decrease by >3 from 2, we'd need a value of <−1, which cannot occur. However, a decrease from 2 to 0 would be a 2-point change, still within "Doesn't change" range.
   - **Stays within ±3:** Highly likely given baseline stability and absence of catalysts.

4. **Potential Upsets:** Could there be an unexpected event? Possibilities:
   - Documentary release announcement: Not mentioned in agent report
   - Anniversary coverage: No relevant anniversary in Feb 5-12 window
   - Related crime/legal development: No indication
   - Viral social media moment: Possible but unlikely 2 weeks after execution

5. **Distribution Tethering:** The 90/7/2 split from the base rate analysis provides a reasonable starting point, but needs adjustment for context:
   - We're in a post-event decay phase at baseline
   - The 7% increase rate likely includes the execution spike itself
   - Excluding the spike period, baseline stability is higher than 90%

6. **Confidence Level:** Given the clear post-event decay pattern, absence of catalysts, and return to baseline, I should express high confidence in "Doesn't change" but maintain small probabilities for alternatives to account for unknown unknowns.

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 3%
Doesn't change: 94%
Decreases: 3%
