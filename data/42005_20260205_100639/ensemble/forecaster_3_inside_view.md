Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Between 2026-02-05 and 2026-02-12 on the specified US Google Trends timeline, resolve **Increases** if Feb12 > Feb5 +3; **Decreases** if Feb12 < Feb5 −3; else **Doesn’t change**.

(a) Source analysis (what each source says + quality)
- WBRC (AP republish), ABC7, AP News, KPRC, KHOU clip (Jan 28–29, 2026): All describe Charles Victor Thompson’s Texas execution (first US execution of 2026), his crimes, legal history, and 2005 escape. High-quality for the fact of a short-lived news spike; limited direct relevance to Feb 5–12 except as evidence the main attention catalyst already occurred.
- Death Penalty Information Center (tabular list): Reliable factual listing that confirms the execution and date; reinforces “event is over” and likely decay.
- AskNews items: Mostly unrelated “Charles”/“Thompson” stories (Charles Schwab, Bicycle Therapeutics’ Travis Thompson, Nigeria fraud case Victor Thompson, etc.). These are noise and unlikely to materially move searches for the exact string “charles victor thompson.” The only somewhat adjacent item is the general “executions” context, but it doesn’t name him.
- Provided Google Trends context + observed recent values (Jan 29 peak, then rapid drop to ~1–2 by Feb 4–5): This is the most decision-relevant “instrument reading.” While Trends is sampled/normalized and can jitter, the fixed start/end URL largely reduces rescaling drift.

Factual vs opinion: The execution date/time, identity, and “first execution of 2026” framing are factual claims consistently reported. Quotes from family/prosecutors are opinions/emotions and don’t forecast future search behavior except indirectly via media amplification (which has already passed).

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence
- Clear post-event decay in Google Trends: peak around execution date, then collapse to ~baseline by Feb 1–5. This pattern is highly predictive that the next week stays low absent a new catalyst.
- Structural “status quo”: execution completed; no ongoing trial/appeals scheduled in-window. Completed events typically stop generating name-specific searches quickly.

Moderate evidence
- Continued but diminishing media republication/retrospectives (late Jan pieces, archive clip): suggests a tail, but that tail is already largely priced into current low readings.
- Low-level baseline/jitter possibility: when volumes are tiny, small absolute changes can appear as +4 or more on the 0–100 index; this raises the chance of an “Increases” outcome modestly even without major news.

Weak evidence
- Other “Thompson/Charles” news: unlikely to map onto this exact query; minimal expected spillover to the full-name search term.

Net: evidence strongly favors “Doesn’t change,” with a small residual risk of a random low-volume blip upward; “Decreases” is mechanically constrained by the floor (0) and the likely low starting point.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Horizon: 7 days (from today 2026-02-05 to 2026-02-12).
- If halved (~3–4 days): even less time for a fresh catalyst; “Doesn’t change” would be slightly higher.
- If doubled (~14 days): more opportunity for a documentary mention, social-media resurfacing, or sampling jitter; “Increases” would rise modestly (and “Doesn’t change” fall).

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside view)
Outside view base rates provided: Increases 3 / Doesn’t change 94 / Decreases 3.

Adjustments:
- I reduce **Decreases** materially versus the outside view because (i) the series is already near the floor, and (ii) the resolution requires a drop of >3 points; with a likely Feb5 value around 0–3 on a fixed-range chart, a >3 drop is often mathematically impossible. Decreases is still not literally impossible (e.g., if Feb5 ends up being ~5–7 due to normalization/sampling, then Feb12 could be ~1–3), but it’s quite unlikely.
- I increase **Increases** slightly versus outside view, not because I expect new substantive news, but because low-volume Google Trends can occasionally show small “blips” that clear the +3 threshold (e.g., 1→5 or 2→6) without a major national headline—especially for recently-newsworthy names.
- The remainder goes to **Doesn’t change**, still the dominant outcome given the completed-event decay and lack of identified upcoming triggers specific to Thompson.

Probability calibration
- A ±10 shift test: If I moved “Doesn’t change” from ~95 to ~85, I’d be implicitly claiming a ~15% chance of a >3-point move in a dead-news, near-floor series over one week—this feels too high. If I moved it to ~99, I’d be underweighting known Trends jitter at low volumes. So mid-90s seems right.
- Primary blind spot: an unexpected high-visibility follow-up (e.g., viral clip about his escape, renewed debate piece calling him “first execution of 2026,” or a streaming/documentary tie-in) could cause a name-specific spike and yield “Increases.”

Checklist:
1. Options/criteria: Compare Feb12 vs Feb5 on the given URL; >+3=Increases, within ±3=Doesn’t change, <−3=Decreases.
2. Outside-view base rates: [3, 94, 3].
3. Consistency: Most likely=Doesn’t change; least likely=Decreases; yes, aligns with near-floor dynamics.
4. Key evidence: (i) Execution spike already decayed to ~1–2; (ii) no ongoing proceedings/catalysts; (iii) fixed-date Trends reduces rescaling; (iv) low-volume jitter can create occasional +4 blips.
5. Blind spot: viral or documentary/major article revisit could spike searches → more “Increases.”
6. Technicalities: probabilities 0–100, sum to 100.

Probabilities: [4, 95, 1]
