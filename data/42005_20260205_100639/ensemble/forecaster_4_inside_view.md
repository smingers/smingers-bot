Analysis
(a) Source analysis (abridged – grouped where content is substantially identical)

1. Associated Press, ABC7, WBRC, APNews, TMZ, Newsweek, El Confidencial, Europa Press, 20 Minuten, Expressen  
   • Date: 28–29 Jan 2026  
   • Content: factual reports of Thompson’s 29 Jan execution, background, final appeals.  
   • Quality: high (mainstream, primary-day reporting). Facts, scant opinion.

2. Click2Houston (KPRC), KHOU, Houston Public Media  
   • Date: 27–29 Jan 2026  
   • Local pre-execution and archival pieces (escape interview). High-quality local news, factual.

3. Death Penalty Information Center list  
   • Date: 2026 (table updated 29 Jan)  
   • Official execution record, high reliability, purely factual.

4. Asknews harvest (Feb 2-4 2026) – dozens of unrelated “Thompson/Charles” items (stocks, mayor, bicycle therapeutics, EFCC fraud case, real-estate sales, etc.)  
   • Most do NOT concern “charles victor thompson” specifically and therefore have minimal relevance. Quality varies (financial wires, blogs). Factual but low salience.

5. Google Trends snapshot (link supplied in question)  
   • Date range: 13 Jan–1 Feb (value series shown). Hard data, strongest evidence for baseline.

(b) Evidence analysis (mapped to weighting rubric)

Strong evidence  
• Google Trends 90-day statistics: week-to-week change ≤3 occurs 90% of the time.  
• Structural decay pattern after one-off crime/ execution spikes – well-documented in prior cases.

Moderate evidence  
• Current value on 5 Feb is 1-2 (near floor), limiting downside and requiring fresh news for >+3 jump.  
• News cycle has ended; no scheduled legal or media events for Thompson.  
• Upcoming 10 Feb Florida execution may re-mention him as “first executed in 2026”, offering a small uptick pathway.

Weak evidence  
• Possible viral social-media clip of his famous 2005 escape; no sign yet.  
• Miscellaneous articles about other men named “Thompson” could incidentally raise the term but unlikely to focus on full name “charles victor thompson”.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Window: 7 days (5 Feb→12 Feb). If window were halved to 3.5 days, inertia / lack of news would push “Doesn’t change” even higher. If doubled to 14 days (to 19 Feb), risk of a later documentary segment or anniversary piece would raise “Increase” a bit and “Decrease” slightly (re-scaling issues).

(d) Justification & inside-view shift  
Start from outside-view 7 / 92 / 1 (Increase / No change / Decrease).  
Adjustments:  
+1 pp to Increase for potential brief mention during the 10 Feb Florida execution coverage.  
+1 pp to Decrease because Feb 5 value could still be 4–5 if Google reconsolidates the late-Jan spike tomorrow morning (rare, but observed in low-volume series).  
Resulting re-allocation – 2 pp taken from “Doesn’t change”. No other factors strong enough to overturn reference-class.

Probability calibration
Increases: 8  
Doesn’t change: 90  
Decreases: 2  

Checklist (abridged)
1. Option paraphrase: Compare Google Trends US value for “charles victor thompson” on 5 Feb vs 12 Feb; >+3=Increase, |≤3|=No change, <−3=Decrease.  
2. Outside base: 7 / 92 / 1.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = No change, least = Decrease – matches rationale.  
4. Key evidence: (a) 90-day stats 90 % stable; (b) post-execution decline to value≈2; (c) no scheduled Thompson news; (d) possible Florida-execution echo on 10 Feb.  
5. Blind-spot: Viral TikTok/YouTube clip of his 2005 jailbreak reaches mainstream press, pushing value >10. Would move “Increase” to ≥30 %.  
6. Numbers sum to 100 and between 0–100.

Probabilities: [8, 90, 2]
