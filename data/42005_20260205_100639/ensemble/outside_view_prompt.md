You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “charles victor thompson” change between 2026-02-05 and 2026-02-12 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “charles victor thompson” at the time of writing this question (Feb 1, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 6; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=charles%20victor%20thompson&date=2026-01-02%202026-02-01).

<Agent_report>
Query: Status of Charles Victor Thompson legal proceedings or media events Feb 2026
All publicly-available sources indicate that Charles Victor Thompson’s long-running criminal case concluded with his execution on the evening of Wednesday, 28 January 2026, at the Texas Department of Criminal Justice Huntsville Unit. No further court action, clemency request, or parole-related proceeding is possible because the death sentence has now been carried out; consequently, there is no active litigation involving Thompson in February 2026. Media coverage in early February consists solely of retrospective reporting on the execution rather than any new legal developments.

Key points, arranged chronologically and thematically, are set out below.

1. Background of the case  
• Crime: Thompson fatally shot his ex-girlfriend Glenda Dennise Hayslip (39) and her new boyfriend Darren Keith Cain (30) in the pre-dawn hours of 30 April 1998 after an earlier argument at Hayslip’s Tomball, Texas apartment (Houston Public Media, 29 Jan 2026; CBS News, 29 Jan 2026).  
• Initial conviction and sentence: He was tried for capital murder, convicted in 1999 and sentenced to death.  
• 2001 resentencing order: The Texas Court of Criminal Appeals (TCCA) vacated the original death sentence after finding a Sixth Amendment violation—prosecutors had used a covert jail informant (World Socialist Web Site, 30 Jan 2026).  
• 2005 punishment retrial: A new Harris County jury again imposed the death penalty on 28 October 2005.  
• 2005 escape: One week later Thompson escaped from the Harris County Jail, disguised himself with a homemade ID badge, and remained at large three days before capture in Shreveport, Louisiana (Houston Public Media, 29 Jan 2026; Fox News, 29 Jan 2026).

2. Appellate and clemency activity leading up to the execution  
• Federal and state habeas petitions challenging, among other issues, ineffective counsel and medical-causation testimony were litigated for two decades; all were ultimately denied.  
• Final state habeas filing: On 22 January 2026 Thompson submitted a successive state application raising five claims, including confrontation-clause and ineffective-assistance arguments. The TCCA dismissed it on abuse-of-the-writ grounds on 26 January 2026 (Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty, 29 Jan 2026).  
• Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles: On Monday, 26 January 2026, the Board voted against clemency or a reprieve (Houston Public Media, 29 Jan 2026; ABC7 Los Angeles, 29 Jan 2026).  
• U.S. Supreme Court: A certiorari petition and motion for stay focused on the inability to cross-examine the medical examiner regarding whether Hayslip died from the gunshot or alleged subsequent medical malpractice. At approximately 5:00 p.m. CST on 28 January, the Court denied both requests without opinion, eliminating the final legal barrier (CBS News, 29 Jan 2026).

3. Execution details  
• Date/time: 28 January 2026; lethal injection of pentobarbital commenced shortly after 6:28 p.m.; Thompson was pronounced dead at 6:50 p.m. CST (Houston Public Media, 29 Jan 2026).  
• Age: 55 years.  
• Witness statements: Thompson’s final words asked the victims’ families for forgiveness and stressed that “there are no winners in this situation; it creates more victims” (Fox News, 29 Jan 2026). Dennis Cain, father of Darren Cain, said afterward, “He’s in hell,” signalling closure for the family (CBS News, 29 Jan 2026). Harris County District Attorney Sean Teare, who witnessed the injection, called it “justice a long time coming” (Houston Public Media, 29 Jan 2026).  
• National context: Thompson became the first person executed in the United States in 2026; Texas historically leads in executions, though Florida surpassed it in 2025 (ABC7 Los Angeles, 29 Jan 2026).

4. Media coverage after execution (late January–February 2026)  
• Nationwide wire stories from the Associated Press were republished by outlets such as Cleveland.com (29 Jan 2026), WALB (29 Jan 2026) and 29News (29 Jan 2026).  
• Analytic pieces appeared on advocacy sites such as the World Socialist Web Site (30 Jan 2026), critiquing Texas capital punishment trends.  
• Advocacy group statements: The Texas Coalition to Abolish the Death Penalty issued a press release on 29 January lamenting the state’s first execution of the year (TCADP, 29 Jan 2026).  
• Popular-culture note: Some stories reminded readers that Thompson had been profiled in a 2018 episode of Netflix’s “I Am a Killer” (AOL, 29 Jan 2026).  
A review of mainstream, regional, and criminal-justice-focused news outlets through 5 February 2026 reveals no follow-up hearings, lawsuits, documentaries, or other media events featuring new information on Thompson. Coverage tapers off to historical summaries by early February. Thus, the only “media events” in February are a continuation of January’s syndicated reports, not fresh developments.

5. Current status of legal proceedings as of February 2026  
• Capital case: Closed. Judgment of death executed; appellate and habeas avenues extinguished.  
• Civil matters: The only known civil suit related to the case—Hayslip’s family’s 1999–2002 malpractice action against a treating physician—ended in 2002 with a defense verdict (ABC7 Los Angeles, 29 Jan 2026). No open civil claims are referenced in 2026 reporting.  
• Parole or probation: Not applicable after execution.

6. Outstanding information gaps  
The available reports answer virtually all aspects of Thompson’s procedural history up to his death. Nevertheless, two minor gaps remain:  
a) Whether Thompson’s body was claimed by family, donated, or buried at state expense (not addressed in retrieved sources).  
b) Whether any documentary filmmakers or podcasts have scheduled post-execution releases examining the case (the January articles only mention his 2018 Netflix appearance). These questions are outside the narrow legal-proceedings scope but could interest researchers tracking cultural impact.

7. Conclusion  
• Thompson’s legal odyssey—initial conviction, resentencing, escape, and decades of appeals—ended definitively with his execution on 28 January 2026.  
• As of February 2026 there are no active or pending legal proceedings in any court, and media coverage has shifted from real-time updates to historical retrospectives.  
• Unless new investigative or entertainment projects arise in the future, the matter of Charles Victor Thompson is closed from both judicial and news perspectives.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
