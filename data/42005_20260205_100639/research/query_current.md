Analysis:
The key to anticipating Google Trends movement is whether something newsworthy about Charles Victor Thompson is likely to occur between Feb 5 and Feb 12 2026. Thompson is a Texas death-row prisoner convicted of a 1998 double murder who briefly escaped custody in 2005. Search interest could spike if there is:
• a scheduled execution date or a stay
• a court ruling on appeals or clemency
• major media coverage (documentary, podcast episode, anniversary story)
• any new escape-related revelation or viral social-media content

Therefore we need very current reporting, official court or Texas Department of Criminal Justice notices, and any announcements from major outlets. Queries should capture “execution,” “appeal,” “parole,” and general “latest news” around his name.
