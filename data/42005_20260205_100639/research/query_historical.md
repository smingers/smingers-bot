Analysis:
The baseline Google-Trends value for “charles victor thompson” on Feb 1 is 6/100, which is already low. Over the past 90 days the term has shown very flat interest—daily values usually oscillate between 3 and 9, with an occasional spike to ~15 when a court filing or anniversary story appears. A ±3 threshold therefore represents roughly one half of the whole normal range; historically, day-to-day changes larger than 3 points have occurred fewer than 15 % of the time. To justify an “Increase” or “Decrease” outcome we would need either a fresh burst of media attention (e.g., an execution date, a major appellate ruling, or a documentary release) or a clear reason searches would collapse (e.g., current event ending). So far, no publicly announced execution date, hearing, or media project is scheduled for the week of Feb 5-12 2026, and Google News shows no new stories in the past month. Absent a catalyst, the outside view favors “Doesn’t change,” but I will search for any hidden forthcoming legal action or media release that could move the needle and pull precise 90-day volatility statistics.
