According to the Uyo Zonal Directorate of the EFCC, Thompson deceived victims\u2014including Tammy Jensen, Peter Jensen, Kenneth Blad, and other unsuspecting investors\u2014by falsely claiming he would facilitate investments in mineral resource mining and deep seaport development projects. One count specified that between April 2024 and December 2024, Thompson fraudulently obtained $213,350 under false pretences, violating the Advance Fee Fraud and Other Related Offences Act, 2006. Thompson pleaded not guilty to all charges. Prosecution counsel Joshua Abolarin urged the court to remand him in a correctional facility and set a trial date. Defence counsel Savn Daniel applied for bail, which the prosecution opposed. Justice Maureen Adaobi adjourned the case to March 19, 2026, for a ruling on the bail application and trial commencement. Pending the decision, Thompson was ordered remanded at the EFCC detention facility in Uyo. The EFCC stated the arraignment underscores its commitment to combating cross-border financial crimes and protecting Nigeria\u2019s financial integrity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 07:39 AM\nSource:[Nairaland](https://www.nairaland.com/8611839/efcc-arraigns-thompson-allegedly-swindling)\n\n**Mont-de-Marsan Mayor Charles Dayot Investigated for Conflict of Interest in Municipal Property Sale**\nThe mayor of Mont-de-Marsan, Charles Dayot, is under investigation for suspected illegal conflict of interest in connection with the sale of two floors of a municipal building located above the central post office on Place du G\u00e9n\u00e9ral-Leclerc. The transaction, initially valued at approximately \u20ac360,000, was first approved in March 2024 with an offer of \u20ac350,000 from FDMC, a company owned by entrepreneur M.C.*. The sale was later renegotiated to \u20ac330,000 in August 2024 due to asbestos removal costs, and the acquiring entity changed to MOCHO, a company jointly owned by M.C.* and A.M.*, a local real estate developer. Crucially, Charles Dayot is associated with A.M.* through a dormant SCI (civil real estate company), and he participated in the June 25, 2025, municipal vote approving the final sale without disclosing these ties. The prosecutor's office in Pau has opened an investigation, assigning it to either the Pau police or the Bayonne judicial police, to determine whether Dayot violated impartiality laws. The investigation also focuses on the sudden appearance of A.M.*\u2019s name in the final deliberation, absent from earlier documents, raising questions about potential concealment. Dayot denies any wrongdoing, claiming his SCI is inactive and merely used for a past property acquisition, and asserts no intent to hide information. A.M.* also denies any conflict of interest, calling the allegations an artificial construction meant to fuel controversy. This case marks the third legal proceeding against Dayot, following a prior investigation into his driving while suspended and a separate harassment complaint from a former aide. Dayot, who has served as mayor since 2017, announced his candidacy for re-election in the March 2026 municipal elections.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 04:00 PM\nSource:[France Bleu](https://www.francebleu.fr/nouvelle-aquitaine/landes-40/mont-de-marsan/mont-de-marsan-le-parquet-saisi-pour-une-troisieme-affaire-visant-le-maire-charles-dayot-9376333)\n\n**Monday's Insider Activity: Top Buys and Sells Revealed for Feb 3 By Investing.com**\nOn February 3, 2026, insider trading activity revealed notable purchases and sales across U.S. stocks.

The transaction, initially approved in March 2024 with an offer of \u20ac350,000 from FDMC (owned by entrepreneur M.C.*), was later renegotiated in August 2024 to \u20ac330,000 due to asbestos removal costs. The buyer changed to MOCHO, a company owned by M.C.* and A.M.*, a local property developer. On June 25, 2025, the municipal council approved the final sale, but Charles Dayot participated in the vote without disclosing his business ties to A.M., with whom he is associated through a dormant SCI (civil real estate company). The prosecutor in Pau, Rodolphe Jarry, confirmed the opening of an investigation, to be handled by either the Pau police or the Bayonne judicial police. The case centers on whether Dayot violated his duty of impartiality by voting on a deal involving a business associate. Additionally, the name of A.M. only appeared in the final deliberation, raising questions about possible concealment. The investigation was triggered by a report from the Landes prefecture, which questioned the transparency of the June 2025 vote. Dayot claims his SCI is inactive, with no bank account, activity, or loans, and that the company was only used to acquire a property over ten years ago. He denies any intent to conceal A.M.'s involvement, stating the dossier was unanimously approved and reviewed by commissions where associates were clearly identified. A.M. denies any conflict of interest, calling the allegations an artificial construction to fuel controversy. This case is the third judicial proceeding against Dayot, following prior investigations into his driving with a suspended license (2022\u20132025) and a harassment complaint from a former collaborator. Dayot, who has served as mayor since 2017, announced his candidacy for re-election in March 2026.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 11:00 AM\nSource:[France Bleu](https://www.francebleu.fr/infos/faits-divers-justice/mont-de-marsan-le-parquet-saisi-pour-une-troisieme-affaire-visant-le-maire-charles-dayot-9376333)\n\n**Charles Victor Thompson Becomes First U.S. Inmate to Be Executed in 2026**\nCharles Victor Thompson, a 55-year-old man from Texas, became the first person executed in the United States in 2026, dying by lethal injection at 6:50 PM Central Time on Wednesday at the Texas State Penitentiary in Huntsville, about 70 miles north of Houston, according to the Associated Press. Thompson was convicted of capital murder in 1999 for the April 1998 double murder of his ex-girlfriend, Glenda Dennise Hayslip, and her boyfriend, Darren Keith Cain, in a Houston apartment. His original death sentence was overturned, but he was retried in 2005, convicted again, and sentenced to death. In November 2005, Thompson escaped from the Harris County Jail in Houston, evading capture for three days before being arrested in Shreveport, Louisiana, after attempting to receive wire transfers to flee to Canada. The Texas Board of Pardons and Paroles denied his request to commute his sentence on Monday, and the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his final appeal just before execution. Prior to his death, Thompson expressed regret, stating, 'there were no winners in this situation.' He was featured in one episode of Netflix\u2019s 'I Am a Killer' in 2018 and joked with prison staff in an October 2025 interview with the Houston Press.

The crime involved the murder of his ex-girlfriend, Dennise Hayslip, and her new partner, Darren Cain, during a violent confrontation in Houston. Thompson, who had been on death row for over two decades, returned to the apartment armed after a prior police intervention, shot Cain fatally, and severely injured Hayslip, who later died from her wounds. He fled the scene, evaded capture for hours, and surrendered the next day. In 1999, he was sentenced to death; his defense claimed intoxication and obsession, while prosecutors portrayed him as manipulative and violent. Thompson gained further notoriety in 2005 for escaping during a court hearing by impersonating a prison official, traveling hundreds of miles on a freight train before being arrested. While incarcerated, he maintained a website and social media presence from Europe, raising funds and promoting his claim that the killing was a 'passionate act' and an act of self-defense\u2014positions rejected by courts and victims' families.

In his final statement, Thompson expressed remorse, saying, 'There are no winners in this situation,' and urged forgiveness, love, and faith in Jesus. He was pronounced dead 22 minutes after the lethal injection. Texas has carried out the most executions in U.S. history, though Florida led in 2025 with 19 executions.

Prior to execution, the U.S. Supreme Court rejected his final appeal. His attorneys argued that his former girlfriend died not from gunshot wounds but from complications due to a failed intubation that caused severe brain damage from oxygen deprivation. Her family had sued one of the treating physicians for medical negligence, but a jury ruled in the doctor\u2019s favor in 2002. Thompson was retried and sentenced to death again in November 2005. Earlier, he had briefly escaped from Harris County Jail in Houston by walking out through an unsecured front door, using a homemade ID to pass guards; he was captured in Louisiana while attempting to arrange funds to flee to Canada.

Interest in the U.S. has also hit a one-year low, reflecting declining public engagement with digital assets. The decline is attributed to factors including former U.S. President Donald Trump's large-scale tariff policies and the collapse of retail investor confidence, particularly after the Trump family's meme coin scandal, which saw its value drop by over 90%. The cryptocurrency market experienced a flash crash in October, with leveraged liquidations reaching nearly $20 billion and some altcoins losing up to 99% in a single day. Bitcoin fell from over $125,000 in November to around $80,000 before stabilizing between $80,000 and $90,000. The Fear & Greed Index hit a yearly low of 10 in November, indicating 'extreme fear' among investors. As of December 26, 2025, the index reached 20, signaling 'extreme fear' for two consecutive weeks. Despite this, market sentiment has shown slight improvement compared to previous months. While some analysts, including Charles Hoskinson, founder of Cardano, and institutions like Standard Chartered and Bernstein, predict Bitcoin could reach $250,000 by 2026 due to supply constraints and growing institutional demand, others, like Jan3 founder Samson Mow, argue 2025 marks the start of a bear market, with a strong bull run possibly beginning by 2035.
