Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**C-SPAN clips (dates unclear)**: Two references to Omar town hall events, but content extraction failed - only boilerplate text visible. Cannot verify details. **Quality: UNUSABLE**

**Omar's House Press Release (Feb 4, 2026)**: Primary source documenting Omar's floor speech calling to abolish ICE and impeach DHS Secretary Noem. References two fatal ICE shootings (Renee Good, Alex Pretti). **Quality: HIGH - Official source, factual for Omar's positions**

**NPR (Feb 2, 2023)**: Historical article about Omar's 2023 removal from Foreign Affairs Committee. **Quality: HIGH but IRRELEVANT - 3 years old, outside forecast window**

**Times of India videos (dates unclear)**: Two articles with mismatched headlines/content. One shows Trump questioning if Omar attack was staged; content extraction appears corrupted with unrelated cricket content. **Quality: LOW - Cannot verify factual claims**

**AskNews Articles (Jan-Feb 2026)**: Multiple high-quality sources documenting:
- **Jan 27-28, 2026 Attack**: Anthony Kazmierczak, 55, sprayed Omar with apple cider vinegar/water at Minneapolis town hall. He faces federal assault charges. Multiple sources (CBS, NBC, The Hill, Independent) confirm details. **Quality: STRONG**
- **Feb 3-4, 2026 Court Proceedings**: Judge ordered Kazmierczak detained. **Quality: STRONG**
- **Trump's Response (Feb 2-3, 2026)**: Trump claimed attack was staged, suggested Omar linked to ISIS, called for deportation. Multiple sources confirm. **Quality: STRONG for factual claims about what Trump said**
- **Omar's ICE Criticism (Feb 3-4, 2026)**: Omar called Minneapolis "occupied" by ICE, demanded Noem's resignation. Multiple sources confirm. **Quality: STRONG**
- **Milwaukee Event (Feb 8, 2026)**: Wisconsin Muslim Journal reports Omar scheduled as keynote at unity event. **Quality: MODERATE - Community publication, but specific date within forecast window**

**Irrelevant Articles**: Multiple articles about Egyptian actor "Essam Omar" and unrelated topics. These do not pertain to Rep. Ilhan Omar.

**Opinion vs Fact Separation**:
- FACTS: Attack occurred Jan 27; Kazmierczak charged; Trump made specific statements; Milwaukee event Feb 8
- OPINIONS: Characterizations like "hateful rhetoric," "terrorist," "staged" - these are attributed opinions, not established facts

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE:**
1. **Jan 27 attack is 9-18 days old by forecast window (Feb 5-14)**: Multiple independent sources confirm attack date. Historical Google Trends patterns show exponential decay after political events, with most interest dissipating within 7-10 days. By Feb 5, the attack is 9 days old; by Feb 14, it's 18 days old. This strongly suggests baseline interest will be declining or stable-low throughout the period.

2. **Current baseline already low (value=7 on Feb 1)**: The question states Feb 1 value is 7 compared to last 30 days. This indicates the attack spike has already substantially decayed by 5 days post-event. This is strong evidence that further decay is likely unless new catalysts emerge.

3. **Milwaukee event Feb 8 is regional, not national**: While confirmed, this is a faith community gathering in Milwaukee, not a nationally televised event. Historical patterns show local events rarely move national Google Trends significantly unless they generate viral moments or national media coverage.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**
1. **Trump continues attacking Omar publicly**: Feb 2-3 statements documented. Trump's attacks on Omar have historically generated search interest, but the pattern shows diminishing returns - his attacks are frequent enough that they're no longer novel catalysts unless exceptionally inflammatory.

2. **House in session Feb 5-13**: Provides platform for floor speeches/viral moments, but Omar giving speeches is routine. No specific high-profile events (committee hearings, votes on Omar-related matters) are documented for this period.

3. **Kazmierczak detention hearing occurred Feb 3**: Further legal proceedings possible but not scheduled within forecast window based on available information.

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**
1. **Ongoing investigations (DOJ, House Oversight)**: Multiple sources mention investigations into Omar's finances, but no hearings or announcements are scheduled for Feb 5-14 window. Speculative.

2. **Threat statistics (58% increase in 2025)**: Contextual background but doesn't predict specific Feb 5-14 dynamics.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 9 days (Feb 5 to Feb 14, 2026)
**Key date**: Feb 8 Milwaukee event (day 4 of 9)

**If timeframe halved (4-5 days)**:
- Would increase probability of "doesn't change" - less time for decay or new catalysts
- Milwaukee event would be proportionally more significant (occurring mid-window)
- Prediction: 60% doesn't change, 20% increases, 20% decreases

**If timeframe doubled (18 days)**:
- Would increase probability of "decreases" - more time for natural decay from Jan 27 attack
- Would increase probability of unexpected catalysts occurring
- Prediction: 40% doesn't change, 25% increases, 35% decreases

**Current 9-day window assessment**:
- Long enough for continued decay from Jan 27 attack (will be 18 days old by Feb 14)
- Short enough that absence of major new catalysts makes stability likely
- Milwaukee event is only confirmed catalyst, occurring mid-window

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Adjustment Factors:**

**Factors supporting "Doesn't Change" (52% → 58%)**:
1. The ±3 threshold is relatively wide - provides buffer against small fluctuations
2. Feb 1 baseline of 7 is already low, suggesting limited downside unless interest drops to 3-4 range
3. 9-day window is short enough that absent major news, values tend to stabilize
4. Milwaukee event may generate modest uptick that offsets decay, keeping within ±3 range

**Factors supporting "Decreases" (25% → 30%)**:
1. Jan 27 attack will be 18 days old by Feb 14 - well past typical news cycle (7-10 days)
2. Feb 1 value of 7 suggests we're already on decay trajectory from attack spike
3. No major scheduled catalysts beyond regional Milwaukee event
4. If Feb 5 baseline has already declined to 5-6, further decay to 2-3 by Feb 14 would qualify as "decreases"

**Factors supporting "Increases" (23% → 12%)**:
1. Requires Feb 14 value >3 points above Feb 5 value
2. Milwaukee event unlikely to generate +3 point national spike
3. Trump attacks are frequent but showing diminishing returns as catalysts
4. No scheduled investigations/hearings in window
5. Would require unexpected major catalyst (new security incident, major Trump statement, charges filed, viral moment)

**Key Adjustment**: I'm reducing "Increases" probability significantly because:
- The attack is now old news (9-18 days during window)
- Milwaukee event is regional, not national
- No other concrete catalysts scheduled
- Baseline already low at 7, suggesting decay trajectory

I'm moderately increasing "Decreases" because the natural decay from a 9-18 day old event is more likely than a new spike, and increasing "Doesn't Change" because the ±3 threshold provides substantial buffer.

## Probability Calibration

**90% confidence interval**: The Feb 14 value will be between 4-10
**70% confidence interval**: The Feb 14 value will be between 5-9

**Reasoning**:
- If Feb 5 baseline is ~6-8 (extrapolating from Feb 1=7), then Feb 14 in range 4-10 represents either stability, modest decay, or modest increase
- The ±3 threshold means Feb 14 needs to be outside 3-11 range (if Feb 5=7) to register as change
- Most likely: Feb 14 lands in 4-9 range, qualifying as "doesn't change" or "decreases"

**Blind spots**:
1. **Trump makes major inflammatory statement Feb 5-14**: Could spike interest +5-10 points. Probability ~15-20%
2. **New security incident or threat**: Low probability (~5%) but high impact
3. **Viral social media moment from Milwaukee event**: Low probability (~8%) but possible
4. **Charging decision/new legal development for Kazmierczak**: Moderate probability (~15%) but unclear if it would move national interest significantly
5. **Feb 5 baseline is different than expected**: If Feb 5 value has already dropped to 4-5, then stability at 4-5 through Feb 14 would register as "doesn't change" rather than "decreases"

**Confidence assessment**: 
- I'm moderately confident in "doesn't change" (58%) - the wide ±3 threshold and short window support stability
- I'm less confident than outside view suggested for "increases" (12% vs 23%) because concrete catalysts are lacking
- I'm more confident in "decreases" (30% vs 25%) because natural decay trajectory is evident

The most likely scenario to make this forecast wrong: Trump makes a major inflammatory statement about Omar (e.g., announces DOJ charges, makes deportation threat at rally, links her to terrorism in prime-time interview) during Feb 5-14 window, spiking interest above Feb 5 baseline by >3 points.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Google Trends value for "ilhan omar" on Feb 14 be >3 higher, within ±3, or >3 lower than Feb 5 value?

2. **Base rate**: Outside view: 52% doesn't change, 23% increases, 25% decreases. Final prediction shifts toward stability and decay, away from increases, based on concrete evidence of aging news cycle and lack of scheduled major catalysts.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = "doesn't change" (58%); Least likely = "increases" (12%). This aligns with evidence that Jan 27 attack is old news, Milwaukee event is regional, and no major catalysts scheduled.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Jan 27 attack will be 18 days old by Feb 14 (strong decay signal)
   - Feb 1 baseline already low at 7 (decay trajectory evident)
   - Milwaukee event Feb 8 is regional, not national catalyst
   - No scheduled investigations/hearings in forecast window
   - ±3 threshold provides buffer for stability

5. **Blind spot**: Trump makes major inflammatory statement during Feb 5-14, spiking interest. This would favor "increases" outcome. Probability ~15-20%, which I've incorporated by maintaining 12% on "increases" rather than going lower.

6. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [12, 58, 30]
