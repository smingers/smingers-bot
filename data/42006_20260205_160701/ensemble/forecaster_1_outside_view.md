Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Al Jazeera (Jan 28, 2026)**: Comprehensive article documenting the Jan 28 town hall attack on Omar, Trump's anti-Somali rhetoric, and ICE operations in Minnesota. High-quality international news source. Key facts: Omar sprayed with liquid during town hall; Trump mentioned her within an hour of attack; two Minneapolis residents killed by ICE agents (Renee Good Jan 7, Alex Pretti recently). Facts are well-sourced and dated, though some characterizations ("racist language") represent editorial framing.

**Omar's House Press Release (Feb 4, 2026)**: Official communication from Rep. Omar calling to abolish ICE and impeach DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. Primary source, highly reliable for Omar's stated positions. Confirms two fatal ICE shootings in Minneapolis (Renee Good, Alex Pretti, both 37).

**ABC News (multiple references)**: Reports on town hall attack, FBI investigation, Capitol Police threat statistics (14,938 concerning statements in 2025 vs 9,474 in 2024). Trump's accusation that Omar staged the attack is quoted directly. High-quality mainstream source with factual incident details; opinions clearly attributed to named sources.

**Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder (Jan 21, 2026)**: Announcement of Jan 27 town hall (the one where attack occurred). Local newspaper, factual event listing, no analysis.

**Wisconsin Muslim Journal (Feb 3, 2026)**: Reports Omar scheduled as keynote speaker at Milwaukee unity event on Sunday (Feb 8, 2026 based on dating). Community publication, factual event details. This falls within our forecast window (Feb 5-14).

**Agent Report**: Synthesizes House schedule, Minnesota events, and ongoing investigations. Identifies key catalysts: (1) House in session Feb 5-13; (2) potential charging decisions for Kazmierczak; (3) Milwaukee event Feb 8; (4) ongoing DOJ/House investigations into Omar's finances; (5) potential impeachment articles against Noem. Quality appears good with specific citations, though some speculation about "what could happen."

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Politicians after security incidents**
- Following attacks or threats, politicians typically see immediate spike in search interest, followed by rapid decay unless new developments emerge
- Suitability: HIGH - Omar just experienced attack on Jan 28, we're now Feb 5

**Reference Class 2: Controversial congressional members during active investigations**
- Members under investigation see elevated baseline interest with spikes during hearings/announcements
- Suitability: MODERATE - Omar faces dual investigations (DOJ, House Oversight) but no specific events scheduled in our window

**Reference Class 3: Politicians with scheduled public appearances**
- Public events generate moderate local/national interest depending on controversy level
- Suitability: HIGH - Omar has Milwaukee keynote Feb 8 during forecast period

**Reference Class 4: Google Trends behavior for political figures during "normal" weeks**
- Most politicians show relatively stable or declining interest absent specific news catalysts
- Suitability: MODERATE - baseline for comparison

**Most suitable: Combination of Reference Classes 1 and 3** - Recent attack victim with scheduled public appearance during forecast window.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: Feb 5 to Feb 14 (9 days)
**Current baseline**: Value of 7 on Feb 1 (compared to prior 30 days)

**Key temporal factors**:
1. **Decay from Jan 28 attack**: Attack occurred 8 days before Feb 5. Typical news cycle suggests most attention dissipates within 3-5 days unless sustained by new developments.
2. **Milwaukee event Feb 8**: Falls on day 4 of our 9-day window - potential catalyst for mid-period spike
3. **House session Feb 5-13**: Omar in Washington, potential for floor speeches/viral moments
4. **Investigation timeline**: No specific hearings/announcements scheduled in window based on available info

**Historical pattern consideration**: The question states current value is 7 (as of Feb 1). This is already relatively low, suggesting the Jan 28 attack spike has largely decayed. For the value to "increase" by more than 3 points (threshold for "Increases" outcome), we'd need Feb 14 value >10. For "decrease" we'd need Feb 14 value <4.

## (d) Justification

**Factors favoring stability or decrease**:
- Jan 28 attack is now 17 days old by Feb 14; news cycles typically complete within 7-10 days
- Current value of 7 (Feb 1) suggests spike already decayed from attack
- No major scheduled events beyond Milwaukee speech (which is regional, not national)
- House floor activity is routine; Omar giving speeches is not novel
- Investigations are ongoing but no specific hearings/charges announced for Feb 5-14 window

**Factors favoring increase**:
- Milwaukee keynote Feb 8 could generate coverage, especially given recent attack
- House session provides platform for viral moments (impeachment articles, DHS debates)
- Trump continues attacking Omar publicly - any new Trump statement could spike interest
- Charging decision for Kazmierczak could break during window
- Capitol Police/FBI updates on investigation possible

**Critical assessment**:
The baseline of 7 on Feb 1 is crucial context. This represents interest already 8 days post-attack. Google Trends interest typically peaks 0-2 days after major events then decays exponentially. By Feb 5 (start of forecast), we're 8 days post-attack; by Feb 14 (end), we're 17 days out. Without a NEW major catalyst, natural decay suggests interest will remain stable-to-declining.

The Milwaukee event Feb 8 is the most concrete scheduled catalyst, but it's a regional faith community gathering, not a national media event. It's unlikely to move national search interest significantly unless something newsworthy occurs at the event itself.

House floor activity is unpredictable but Omar giving speeches is routine. The agent report speculates about various possibilities (impeachment articles, subpoenas) but provides no evidence these will actually occur in the Feb 5-14 window.

**Resolution mechanism**: The question measures the value on Feb 14 vs Feb 5 using the fixed URL. The "doesn't change" threshold is ±3 points, which is relatively wide tolerance.

Outside view calibration:

## (a) True probability calibration
I must predict actual outcomes, not hedge. The question asks whether interest increases, stays same (±3), or decreases by >3 points between Feb 5 and Feb 14.

## (b) Previously established distributions
Google Trends data for political figures typically shows:
- High volatility around major events (±20-50 points)
- Rapid decay post-event (exponential, not linear)
- Relatively stable baselines during "normal" periods
- Small random fluctuations (±2-5 points) are common even without news

## (c) Probability significance
- 90% = 9:1 odds = very confident
- 70% = 7:3 odds = moderately confident  
- 50% = even odds = maximum uncertainty

Given the ±3 threshold for "doesn't change," small fluctuations could easily push into "increases" or "decreases" territory.

## (d) Rate of upsets in this domain

Political Google Trends are moderately predictable for scheduled events but highly unpredictable for:
- Unexpected Trump statements/tweets
- Breaking investigation news
- Viral social media moments
- Security incidents

Omar is specifically high-variance due to:
- Trump's obsessive focus on her (documented pattern)
- Ongoing multiple investigations
- Recent security incident
- Controversial positions generating strong reactions

Historical upset rate for "politician Google Trends during normal weeks" is moderate (20-30%) because unexpected news breaks regularly in politics.

**Base rate reasoning**:
- Without new major catalyst: 60-70% chance of stability or slight decline
- With scheduled minor event (Milwaukee): 10-20% chance of modest increase
- With unexpected major event (Trump attack, charges filed, viral moment): 15-25% chance

**Key uncertainty**: The Feb 5 baseline value is unknown to us (we only know Feb 1 = 7). If Feb 5 has already declined to 5-6, then even stability would register as "doesn't change." If Feb 5 spiked to 9-10 due to events Feb 1-5, then decay to 7 by Feb 14 would register as "decreases."

**Most likely scenario**: Interest remains in 4-10 range throughout period, with Feb 14 landing within ±3 of Feb 5 value, qualifying as "doesn't change."

**Second most likely**: Continued decay from attack, with Feb 14 value >3 points below Feb 5, qualifying as "decreases."

**Least likely**: New major catalyst drives Feb 14 value >3 points above Feb 5, qualifying as "increases."

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 23%
Doesn't change: 52%
Decreases: 25%
