Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles:**
1. **C-SPAN clips (dates unclear)** - Technical issues with extraction; confirms town hall occurred and assault incident but lacks substantive detail. Low utility.

2. **Rep. Omar press release (Feb 4, 2026)** - Primary source, 1 day old. Factual for her House floor speech calling to abolish ICE, referencing two fatal shootings by ICE agents in Minneapolis (Renee Good, Alex Pretti). Highly partisan framing but reliable for event occurrence.

3. **NPR (Feb 2, 2023)** - 3 years old, irrelevant to forecast period. Historical context only.

4. **Times of India videos (dates unclear)** - Poor extraction quality; headlines reference Trump-Omar conflict and "$9BN Minnesota scandal" but body text is corrupted/mismatched. Unreliable.

**AskNews Articles (higher quality, recent):**

5. **CBS News (Feb 4, 2026)** - 1 day old. Strong factual reporting: Anthony Kazmierczak ordered detained after Jan 27 assault (sprayed Omar with apple cider vinegar/water). Key fact: associate reported he once said "Somebody should kill that b****" about Omar. Includes 58% increase in Congressional threats (2024-2025). High reliability.

6. **Gateway Pundit (Feb 4, 2026)** - 1 day old. Reports Omar's "ICE occupation" speech. Right-wing outlet with editorial slant, but speech content appears factual (verifiable via other sources).

7. **The Independent (Feb 3, 2026)** - 2 days old. Reports Trump Truth Social post suggesting Omar linked to ISIS (baseless claim per article). Mainstream outlet, good reliability for documenting Trump's rhetoric escalation.

8. **The Hill (Feb 3, 2026)** - 2 days old. Reports judge denied Kazmierczak's release; includes his criminal history and pro-Trump social media. Trump claimed attack was "staged" without evidence. High reliability.

9. **NBC News (Feb 3, 2026)** - 2 days old. Confirms Kazmierczak detention on federal assault charge. Mainstream source, high reliability.

10. **Real Clear Politics (Feb 3, 2026)** - 2 days old. Transcribes Omar's "occupation" speech. Reliable for primary-source content.

11. **Yahoo/social media (Feb 2, 2026)** - 3 days old. Documents social media backlash to Trump's "staged" claim. Useful for gauging online discourse momentum.

12. **Breitbart (Feb 2, 2026)** - 3 days old. Right-wing outlet reporting Trump calling Omar "scammer," demanding jail/deportation over alleged MN fraud. Editorial but documents Trump's rhetoric.

13. **Deseret News (Jan 28, 2026)** - 8 days old. Comprehensive attack coverage plus context on ICE tensions, threats data (15,000 in 2025). High reliability.

14. **Fox News/Independent (Jan 19, 2026)** - 17 days old. Tomi Lahren calls Omar "poster child for closing border." Documents conservative media attacks. Pre-forecast period but shows sustained negative coverage.

15. **TheBlaze (Dec 16, 2025)** - 51 days old. Liz Wheeler predicts Omar deportation in 2026; cites border czar Tom Homan investigating. Speculative but shows investigation claims circulating.

**Non-Omar articles about "Omar" (Egyptian actor Essam Omar):** Multiple Arabic-language articles (Jan 7-24, 2026) about TV series "Champion of the World." These could create noise in Google Trends if searches don't distinguish "Ilhan Omar" vs generic "Omar," but unlikely to significantly affect U.S.-focused "ilhan omar" topic searches.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence for INCREASE:**

1. **Assault incident (Jan 27) + ongoing legal proceedings** - Multiple independent sources confirm. Kazmierczak's detention hearing was Feb 3; federal charges are active. This creates sustained news cycle. However, the assault itself is 9 days before Feb 5 baseline, so already partially reflected in the Feb 1 value of 7.

2. **Trump rhetoric escalation (Feb 2-3)** - Multiple sources document Trump's "staged" claim, ISIS insinuation, deportation calls. Trump's attacks historically drive search interest in his targets. This is 2-3 days before Feb 5, very recent.

3. **Congressional threats data (58% increase 2024-2025)** - Establishes broader context of political violence but doesn't directly predict Feb 5-14 spike.

**Moderate Evidence for INCREASE:**

4. **Omar's Feb 4 House speech** - Just 1 day before Feb 5. Called to abolish ICE, impeach Noem. Likely to generate news coverage Feb 5-7. Single reliable source (her office), but high-profile action.

5. **Milwaukee keynote (Feb 8)** - Wisconsin Muslim Journal reports Omar speaking Feb 8. Public appearance could generate local/regional coverage, but unlikely to drive major national search interest unless incident occurs.

6. **Investigation claims** - Multiple sources (TheBlaze, Breitbart) reference House Oversight investigation into Omar/Mynett finances and border czar Homan investigating immigration fraud. If subpoenas/charges emerge Feb 5-14, major spike. But timing uncertain; these are speculative.

**Moderate Evidence for DECREASE:**

7. **Time decay from Jan 27 assault** - The assault was 9 days before Feb 5. News cycles typically peak 1-3 days post-event. By Feb 5, media attention likely declining unless new developments. The Feb 1 value of 7 (relative to 30-day window) suggests the spike may have already passed.

8. **Scaling effect** - The verification URL uses Jan 15-Feb 14 window. If the Jan 27 assault created the peak (value 100), then Feb 5 and Feb 14 are both measured relative to that peak. Without another comparable event, both dates likely show lower values, potentially similar to each other.

**Weak Evidence:**

9. **Social media "slams"** - Yahoo article documents Twitter backlash to Trump, but social media discourse doesn't reliably predict search volume changes.

10. **Essam Omar TV series** - Arabic-language content unlikely to significantly affect U.S. Google Trends for "ilhan omar" topic.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeframe:** 9 days (Feb 5 → Feb 14)

**Key dates within window:**
- Feb 5-6: Immediate aftermath of Feb 4 House speech
- Feb 8: Milwaukee keynote appearance
- Feb 10-14: Unknown; depends on whether new developments emerge

**If timeframe halved (4-5 days):**
Would increase probability of "Doesn't change" because less time for new catalyst events. The Feb 4 speech effect would dominate, likely causing modest increase.

**If timeframe doubled (18 days):**
Would increase probability of "Increases" or "Decreases" (away from center) because more time for:
- Investigation/subpoena announcements
- Additional Trump attacks
- Another public incident
- Or conversely, complete news cycle exhaustion

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view base rates:**
- Increases: 32%
- Doesn't change: 36%
- Decreases: 32%

**Key factors shifting probabilities:**

1. **Very recent high-profile speech (Feb 4)** - Omar's House floor speech calling to abolish ICE and impeach Noem occurred just 1 day before the Feb 5 baseline. This is virtually certain to generate news coverage Feb 5-7, which would drive search interest up from the Feb 5 value. Historical pattern: controversial Omar statements reliably generate 2-3 day news cycles.

2. **Trump attack timing (Feb 2-3)** - Trump's "staged" claim and ISIS insinuation are 2-3 days before Feb 5. These attacks typically drive search spikes among both supporters (seeking to amplify) and opponents (seeking to rebut). However, much of this effect may already be captured in the Feb 5 baseline value.

3. **Assault legal proceedings ongoing** - Kazmierczak's detention (Feb 3) keeps the story alive, but the assault itself (Jan 27) is 9+ days old by Feb 5. The news value is declining unless new revelations emerge (e.g., additional charges, trial date, victim impact statements).

4. **Scheduled event (Feb 8)** - Milwaukee appearance is public and scheduled, but keynote speeches rarely drive major search interest unless disrupted or controversial statements made.

5. **Investigation uncertainty** - Multiple sources mention investigations (fraud, immigration), but no confirmed timeline for announcements in Feb 5-14 window. This is a wildcard that could cause major spike but cannot be reliably predicted.

**Critical insight:** The Feb 5 baseline value of 7 is measured against a 30-day window (Jan 2-Feb 1) that includes the Jan 27 assault spike. This means Feb 5 is already showing relatively low interest compared to recent peak. The question is whether Feb 5-14 contains events that push interest higher than Feb 5, not whether Feb 14 is higher than the Jan 27 peak.

**Directional assessment:**
- The Feb 4 speech is a strong near-term catalyst for increase from Feb 5 baseline
- Trump's Feb 2-3 attacks may have already peaked in search interest by Feb 5
- No major scheduled events Feb 9-14 are known
- Time decay from Jan 27 assault works against sustained high interest

**Magnitude assessment:**
- For "Increases": Need Feb 14 value >3 points above Feb 5
- For "Decreases": Need Feb 14 value >3 points below Feb 5
- The Feb 4 speech likely causes 2-3 day bump (Feb 5-7), but by Feb 14 (10 days later), interest may have declined back to or below Feb 5 level

**Scaling consideration:**
The Jan 15-Feb 14 window means the scale is fixed. If Feb 5-7 sees a mini-spike from the speech (say, reaching value 15-20), that doesn't change the scale (still anchored to Jan 27 peak at 100). So Feb 5 stays at 7, and Feb 14 could be 10-12 (increase) or 4-5 (decrease after speech bump fades).

## Probability Calibration

**Increases (Feb 14 > Feb 5 + 3):**
The Feb 4 speech is a strong catalyst for Feb 5-7 bump. If that bump is sustained or if Milwaukee event (Feb 8) generates additional interest, Feb 14 could be higher than Feb 5. However, 10 days is a long time for interest to remain elevated without new catalysts. Investigations could break but timing uncertain.

Base rate: 32% → Adjust to **40%** (modest increase due to very recent speech)

**Doesn't change (Feb 14 within ±3 of Feb 5):**
This requires Feb 14 to be 4-10 (if Feb 5 = 7). Possible if:
- Speech causes brief 2-3 day bump that fades by Feb 14
- No major new developments Feb 9-14
- Interest returns to baseline low level

However, the 9-day gap makes exact stability less likely than movement. Base rate: 36% → Adjust to **30%** (slightly less likely due to recent volatility)

**Decreases (Feb 14 < Feb 5 - 3):**
This requires Feb 14 to be <4. Possible if:
- Speech bump is very brief (only Feb 5-6)
- By Feb 14, interest has fully decayed from Jan 27 assault
- No new catalysts emerge
- Scaling effect: if another figure has a major story Feb 10-14, relative attention to Omar declines

Base rate: 32% → Adjust to **30%** (slightly less likely because Feb 4 speech provides near-term support)

**Sanity check:** 40% + 30% + 30% = 100% ✓

The probabilities reflect:
- Recent speech (Feb 4) tilts toward short-term increase
- Long tail (Feb 14) allows for decay back to low baseline
- High uncertainty about Feb 9-14 events (investigations, additional Trump attacks, etc.)

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Google Trends value for "ilhan omar" on Feb 14 be >3 higher, within ±3, or >3 lower than Feb 5 value? Window: Jan 15-Feb 14, 2026.

2. **Base rate:** Started at 32%/36%/32% for Increase/Stable/Decrease based on reference class of mid-tier House members.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = Increases (40%); Least likely = Doesn't change and Decreases (tied at 30%). Makes sense given very recent Feb 4 speech provides near-term catalyst, but long tail to Feb 14 allows decay.

4. **Top evidence:**
   - Feb 4 House speech (1 day before baseline) - factually confirmed, high-profile
   - Trump Feb 2-3 attacks - multiple sources confirm, historically drives search interest
   - Jan 27 assault 9 days old by Feb 5 - decay effect likely
   - No known major catalysts Feb 9-14 - increases uncertainty
   - Milwaukee Feb 8 event - confirmed but low expected impact

5. **Blind spot:** Investigation announcement or new incident Feb 9-14 could cause major spike I'm underweighting. Conversely, if another political figure dominates news Feb 10-14, Omar interest could collapse below my estimate. Given high political volatility, should maintain relatively balanced probabilities rather than strong confidence in any single outcome.

6. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs. ✓
