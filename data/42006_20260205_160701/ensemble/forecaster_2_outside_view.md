Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Al Jazeera (Jan 28, 2026):** High-quality international news source. Provides detailed factual account of the town hall attack on Omar on January 28, including identification of suspect Anthony Kazmierczak, 55. Documents Trump's pattern of statements against Omar and Somali community, ICE operations in Minnesota resulting in two civilian deaths, and political context. Facts clearly separated from characterizations.

**Rep. Omar's Official Site (Feb 4, 2026):** Primary source - Omar's own House floor speech calling to abolish ICE and impeach DHS Secretary Kristi Noem. Factual regarding the two fatal shootings (Renee Good and Alex Pretti) but represents Omar's political perspective and demands.

**ABC News (dates unclear, appears late Jan/early Feb 2026):** Reputable mainstream source. Reports FBI takeover of investigation, preliminary finding that liquid was non-toxic, threat statistics (14,938 concerning statements in 2025 vs 9,474 in 2024 - 58% increase). Includes Trump's accusation that Omar staged the attack (opinion without evidence) and Omar's statement attributing threats to Trump's rhetoric (opinion).

**Minnesota Spokesman-Recorder (Jan 21, 2026):** Local community newspaper. Announces town hall for January 27, 2026 (the event where the attack occurred). Purely factual event announcement.

**Wisconsin Muslim Journal (Feb 3, 2026):** Community publication. Reports Omar scheduled as keynote speaker at Faith, Unity and Community Gathering in Milwaukee on Sunday (Feb 8, 2026 based on dating). This is a confirmed public event within our forecast window. Includes context about Trump's statements and recent incidents but the core fact is the scheduled appearance.

**Agent Report:** Synthesizes House schedule information indicating Omar will likely be in Washington for votes Feb 5-13, mentions ongoing investigations (House Oversight Committee probe into finances, DOJ investigation confirmed by Trump Jan 26), notes potential for floor debates on DHS/immigration issues, and identifies Saturday Feb 7 potential protest in Minneapolis. Quality appears good with specific citations, though some information is speculative about what "could" happen.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Google Trends patterns for Congress members during controversy periods:** When a member of Congress is involved in a physical attack or major security incident, search interest typically spikes immediately then decays rapidly over 7-14 days unless new developments occur.

2. **Google Trends for Ilhan Omar specifically during Trump administration conflicts:** Historical pattern shows Omar's search interest spikes when Trump directly attacks her or when she's involved in major controversies, but baseline interest is relatively low (current value of 7 on Jan 30-day scale).

3. **Google Trends behavior over 10-day windows for political figures:** Short-term trends for politicians tend to be event-driven. Without major new events, interest typically declines from a spike.

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** Omar-specific patterns during controversy periods, as she has established search behavior patterns and we have context about her baseline (value of 7 as of Feb 1).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 10 days (Feb 5 to Feb 14, 2026)

**Key Temporal Factors:**

- **Starting point (Feb 5):** One week after the town hall attack (Jan 28). Initial spike in search interest would have occurred Jan 28-30.
- **Decay pattern:** Typical news cycle decay suggests interest declining from the attack unless new catalysts emerge.
- **Known events in window:**
  - Feb 8: Omar keynote speech in Milwaukee (confirmed)
  - Feb 5-13: House in session (likely floor appearances)
  - Potential: Charging decision on Kazmierczak, protest appearances, floor debates

**Historical Pattern:** The attack occurred Jan 28. By Feb 1 (when baseline measurement was taken), Omar's value was 7 on the 30-day scale. This suggests interest had already declined significantly from the immediate spike. The question asks about Feb 5 vs Feb 14 - both dates are after the initial event, in the decay phase.

## (d) Justification

**Baseline Scenario (No Change):** If no major new events occur, we'd expect continued gradual decay from the Jan 28 attack. The Feb 5 starting point is already 8 days post-attack, and Feb 14 is 17 days post-attack. Natural news cycle decay would suggest declining interest.

**Increase Scenarios:**
1. **Milwaukee speech (Feb 8):** Confirmed event but keynote speeches at community gatherings rarely drive national search interest unless something dramatic occurs
2. **House floor activity:** Omar's impeachment threat against Noem and ICE abolition calls could generate coverage if she files articles or speaks prominently
3. **Investigation developments:** DOJ or House Oversight developments could spike interest
4. **Charging decision:** Federal charges against Kazmierczak would be newsworthy
5. **New Trump attacks:** Trump's pattern of attacking Omar could drive another cycle

**Decrease Scenarios:**
1. **Natural decay:** 17 days post-attack with no major new catalysts
2. **Other news competing:** Immigration debates may focus on other figures
3. **Recess approaching:** House activity winds down toward Presidents' Day recess (starts Feb 16)

**Critical Assessment:** The agent report identifies multiple potential catalysts, but most are speculative ("could," "potential," "possibility"). The only confirmed event is the Feb 8 Milwaukee speech, which is unlikely to drive major national search interest. The House being in session increases probability of floor moments, but doesn't guarantee viral coverage. The investigations are ongoing but no specific developments are scheduled.

The comparison is Feb 5 vs Feb 14 values on the locked-date URL. Both dates are in the post-attack decay phase. The question is whether intervening events will cause Feb 14 to be more than 3 points different from Feb 5.

## Outside View Calibration

**Key Considerations:**

1. **Baseline expectation:** Without new major events, continued decay from Jan 28 attack suggests Feb 14 < Feb 5 (Decrease)

2. **Event probability:** While multiple potential catalysts exist, most are uncertain. The Milwaukee speech is confirmed but unlikely to drive major search interest. House floor activity is likely but impact uncertain.

3. **Threshold analysis:** The question requires >3 point change. On Google Trends' 0-100 scale, a 3-point change is relatively small but not trivial. Given Omar's low baseline (7 on 30-day scale), she operates at low absolute search volumes, making percentage changes potentially volatile.

4. **Historical upset rate:** Political Google Trends can be volatile with unexpected events. However, the specific 10-day window and >3 point threshold creates a narrow band for "Doesn't change."

5. **Probability anchoring:** 
   - Strong expectation of decrease from natural decay
   - Moderate probability of catalyzing event causing increase
   - Narrow probability of landing exactly in the ±3 point band

6. **Calibration consideration:** The "Doesn't change" option (within ±3 points) is a narrow target. Most outcomes will fall outside this band given the timeframe and ongoing dynamics.

**Distribution reasoning:**
- Natural decay favors Decrease
- Multiple potential catalysts (though uncertain) favor Increase  
- The ±3 point band for "Doesn't change" is relatively narrow
- Given uncertainty and multiple possible developments, substantial probability to both Increase and Decrease
- Slight edge to Decrease given natural decay and speculative nature of most increase catalysts

Increases: 38%
Doesn't change: 18%
Decreases: 44%
