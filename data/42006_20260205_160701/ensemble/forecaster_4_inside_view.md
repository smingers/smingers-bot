Analysis
(a) Source analysis – facts vs. opinion, quality, date (all 2026 unless noted)
1. CBS / NBC / The Hill (3 & 4 Feb): hard-news, multi-source confirmation of the 27 Jan vinegar assault and court hearings.  --» Facts: Omar attacked, assailant detained, follow-up hearings scheduled.  
2. Omar.house.gov & RealClearPolitics video (3–4 Feb): primary speech text from Omar advocating abolition of ICE. --» Facts: speech occurred; Opinions: rhetorical framing (“occupation”).  
3. The Independent, Yahoo, Breitbart, Gateway Pundit (2–4 Feb): partisan pieces amplifying or attacking Omar/Trump feud.  Quality: mixed; still evidence of continuing media cycle.  
4. C-SPAN listings (late Jan): confirm public town-hall events. Facts minimal.  
5. “Unity” event notice (Wisconsin Muslim Journal, 3 Feb): reliable local outlet; says Omar will keynote Milwaukee rally on Sun 8 Feb.  
6. All other items (Essam/Ilia Topuria, Times of India cricket mis-scrapes): unrelated to “Ilhan Omar”; ignored.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence  
• Historical Google Trends patterns: after a highly-publicised incident (assault 27 Jan) interest typically decays steeply for 1–3 weeks.  
Moderate evidence  
• Ongoing legal coverage (detention hearings, Trump commentary) keeps Omar in national headlines but at lower intensity than the assault itself.  
• Scheduled 8 Feb rally offers a one-day bump potential.  
Weak evidence  
• Partisan op-eds and social-media exchanges—may move niche audiences only.  
• Possible new, unforeseen controversy.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Resolution compares Thu 5 Feb vs Sat 14 Feb (9 days). If the window were halved (≈ 5 days) decay signal weaker, “No change” probability would rise ~+5 pts. If doubled (≈ 18 days) further drift to baseline makes “Decreases” likelier (+5 pts).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside view base: Inc 24 | No 36 | Dec 40  
Current factors:  
• Value on 1 Feb was 7 on a 0-100 scale already anchored by the 27 Jan peak; current reading on 5 Feb is plausibly 4-6.  
• From that low base, a –3 drop (e.g., 5→2) is still feasible; a +3 rise (5→8) requires ~60 % surge—needs a mid-level news spike (possible but less common).  
• Media follow-ups (court rulings, Trump posts, 8 Feb rally) could add brief attention; however none obviously match the original attack’s salience.  
Therefore I nudge weight from “Decrease” to “No change” (decay could stall near floor) and shave a few points from “Increase”. Blind-spot: a fresh, viral confrontation (e.g., another physical threat or major ICE raid) could send searches >+3 quickly.

Probability calibration
Final subjective distribution:
Increases – 20  
Doesn’t change – 45  
Decreases – 35  
(Sums to 100; odds ratios 1 : 2.25 : 1.75)

Checklist (abridged)
1. Options = search value on 14 Feb vs 5 Feb; >+3 → Inc, –3 → Dec, else No change.  
2. Base rate 24|36|40 → adjusted to 20|45|35.  
3. Most likely = No change; least likely = Increase ✔ coherent.  
4. Key evidence: post-spike decay trend; low 7-point reading 1 Feb; court-hearing media drip; 8 Feb rally; ±3 threshold on low baseline.  
5. Blind spot: unexpected high-salience incident (> national headline) during week.  
6. Probabilities sum to 100, no % sign.

Probabilities: [20, 45, 35]
