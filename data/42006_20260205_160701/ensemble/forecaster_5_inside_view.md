Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most relevant first)
1. CBS News (4 Feb 26) – Straight news on vinegar-spray attacker’s detention.  High factual reliability, video + court docs, minimal opinion.  
2. The Hill & NBC News (3 Feb 26) – Independent, mainstream outlets repeating the same court-hearing facts.  Reinforces 1.  
3. Rep. Omar press-release (4 Feb 26) – Primary source for her House-floor speech attacking ICE; partisan but factually reliable about what she said and when.  
4. Independent, Yahoo, Gateway Pundit, Breitbart (2-3 Feb 26) – Opinion-heavy outlets amplifying Trump/Omar feud.  Useful only to gauge volume of partisan chatter; factual component = Trump posts.  
5. Deseret News (28 Jan 26) + C-SPAN clip headers – Original reports of the 27 Jan assault.  Now >1 week old but establishes the spike trigger.  
6. Misc. Arabic/Spanish pieces about “Essam/Ilia Omar” – Name coincidence; not about the congresswoman.  Noise for U.S. Google searches; ignored.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence  
• Historic nine-day Google-Trends dataset 2024-25: |Δ|>3 occurs 44 % of windows; baseline 56 % “no change”.  
• Assault-story ageing curve: Google score already down to 7 by 1 Feb (Trend data).  Past spikes for Omar show half-life ≈2-3 days, reaching background (≈2-3) within 10 days.  

Moderate evidence  
• Fresh news (court rulings 3-4 Feb, Omar ICE speech 4 Feb) extends media tail but is much smaller than original assault.  
• Upcoming public events (Wisconsin keynote 8 Feb) may create local, low-level coverage.  

Weak evidence  
• Possibility of new, unforeseen confrontation or Trump post before 14 Feb.  
• Social-media claims that the attack was “staged” could flare again but are speculative.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Forecast window = 9 days.  If halved (4-5 days) the reversion dynamic would dominate even more → slightly higher “decrease”.  If doubled (18 days) fresh news could accumulate, raising both tail probabilities.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Start value on 5 Feb is almost certainly single-digit (Google Trends chart shows 7 on 1 Feb and decaying).  The dominant structural pattern for Omar: steep spike then exponential decay to baseline ≈2-3.  That decay is likely to finish by ~9 Feb and then flatten.  
Mechanism to push score >+3 (≥11) would need a second-order shock on par with an assault—none is scheduled.  Court updates are continuation stories and historically add ≤2 points.  Therefore I shave 7 pp from the outside-view 22 % “Increase”.  
Conversely, a fall of >3 (e.g., from 6 to ≤2) is plausible because baseline is so low.  I add 5 pp to “Decrease”.  Residual redistributed to “No change”.

Probability calibration
Increases: 15  
Doesn’t change: 52  
Decreases: 33  
Sum = 100.  A ±10 pp swing would move “Decrease” from plausible underdog to favourite; given one-week horizon and possibility of surprise, I keep the middle category narrowly on top.

Checklist
1. Options: compare 5 Feb vs 14 Feb Google US scores; +>3 → Increase, −>3 → Decrease, else No change.  
2. Base rates: 22/53/25.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = No change; least likely = Increase.  Matches rationale.  
4. Key evidence: (i) score already 7 on 1 Feb, (ii) typical post-spike half-life 2-3 days, (iii) only minor follow-up news, (iv) historic 56 % stability windows.  
5. Blind-spot: fresh dramatic event (e.g., new attack or DHS action) before 14 Feb would kick “Increase” above 11.  
6. Probabilities sum to 100, within 0-100.

Probabilities: [15, 52, 33]
