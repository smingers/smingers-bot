You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “ilhan omar” change between 2026-02-05 and 2026-02-14 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “ilhan omar” at the time of writing this question (Feb 1, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 7; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=ilhan%20omar&date=2026-01-02%202026-02-01).

# Summary of Article: "ICE, Ilhan Omar and Somalis: Unpacking Trump's obsession with Minnesota"

**Source:** Al Jazeera  
**Authors:** Elizabeth Melimopoulos, Charu Sudan Kasturi

## Key Facts and Events:

**Attack on Ilhan Omar (Tuesday):**
- Minnesota Congresswoman Ilhan Omar was sprayed with a foul-smelling liquid during a town hall in Minneapolis
- A man identified as 55-year-old Anthony Kazmierczak rushed the stage and targeted her with an unknown substance using a syringe
- Omar was not injured and continued the event after the attack
- The incident occurred as she criticized immigration enforcement, calling for ICE to be abolished and DHS Secretary Kristi Noem to resign or face impeachment
- The attack happened within an hour of Trump mentioning Omar during a speech in Iowa
- Authorities have not publicly identified the substance; witnesses described a strong, unpleasant odor

**Background on Omar:**
- Born in Mogadishu, Somalia; came to the US as a child refugee
- Her family fled Somalia in 1991 during prolonged cycles of clan-based violence, famine, and al-Shabab attacks
- Spent four years in a refugee camp in Kenya before resettlement in Virginia, then moved to Minneapolis
- Represents Minneapolis in the US House of Representatives

**Minnesota's Somali Population:**
- Estimated 80,000 people of Somali origin in Minnesota (largest Somali community in the US)
- Majority were born in the US
- Of those born outside the country, 87% are naturalized citizens
- About 705 Somalis were on Temporary Protected Status (TPS) program

**Trump's Actions and Statements Against Somalis/Somalia:**
- November 21: Announced "immediate" termination of TPS for Somali immigrants in Minnesota, claiming without evidence that "Somali gangs are terrorising" the state and accusing Governor Tim Walz of overseeing fraudulent money laundering activity
- Early December: Told reporters he didn't want Somali immigrants in the US, claiming they "contributed nothing" and called them "garbage" (no evidence provided)
- December: Said Somalia "isn't even a country" and "doesn't function"
- Early January: Administration froze childcare payments in Minnesota during fraud investigation allegedly involving Somali immigrants
- At World Economic Forum in Davos: Claimed "we're cracking down on more than $19 bn in fraud that was stolen by Somalian bandits," making derogatory comments about IQ

**ICE Operations in Minnesota:**
- January 7: Renee Nicole Good, 34, shot dead by ICE agent in Minneapolis while trying to drive away; administration claimed self-defense but video evidence raised questions
- Saturday (recent): Alex Pretti, 37, an intensive care nurse, shot dead by federal agents while helping a woman pushed down by officers; administration claimed he brandished a handgun, but video showed he had no weapon in hand when shot
- January 13 (after Good's death): Trump posted on Truth Social warning "THE DAY OF RETRIBUTION & RECKONING IS COMING"

**Political Context:**
- Governor Tim Walz accused Trump of choosing to "punish" Minnesota because it voted against him in the past three presidential elections (2016, 2020, 2024)
- Minnesota is the only Upper Midwestern state besides Illinois that Trump failed to win in all three presidential bids
- Walz was the Democratic vice presidential candidate in 2024, running against Trump and JD Vance

**History of Trump's Attacks on Omar:**
- April 2019: Falsely accused Omar of downplaying 9/11 attacks, leading to spike in death threats
- July 2019: During re-election bid, accused Omar of being ungrateful as supporters chanted "Send her back!"
- Has repeatedly targeted Omar since then

**Note:** The article describes Trump's language against Somalis as "widely criticised as racist, including by some members of his Republican Party," though it does not provide specific names or sources for this characterization.

<Agent_report>
Query: Upcoming House schedule Ilhan Omar February 2026; check planned appearances, controversies, or votes that could elevate media coverage between 5 Feb and 14 Feb 2026.  Prioritize official House calendar, Minnesota events, and major national stories involving Omar.  Summarize any credible catalysts.
Between 5 Feb and 14 Feb 2026, several converging story lines suggest that Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN-05) will remain a heavy focus of national press.  The catalysts fall into three broad buckets—(1) the official House schedule, (2) Minnesota-based events and protests, and (3) federal or congressional investigations and other controversies.  Each bucket is summarized below, followed by any outstanding information gaps.

1.  Official House calendar, floor votes and committee work  
• SESSION DAYS.  The House is in legislative session the week beginning Monday 2 Feb and—barring last-minute changes—normally works straight through the Thursday of the following week before adjourning for the Presidents’ Day recess that starts Monday 16 Feb.  House calendars published for 2 Feb and 3 Feb confirm business on the floor (rules meeting on 2 Feb; Calendar of the House dated 3 Feb) and there is no announced district work period until 16 Feb, meaning Omar will likely be in Washington for votes from 5 Feb to 13 Feb (GovInfo House calendar for 3 Feb 2026; House.gov daily schedule for 2 Feb 2026).  
• IMMIGRATION/ICE-RELATED LEGISLATION.  The 2 Feb Rules Committee meeting lists H.R. 4090, the “Critical Mineral Dominance Act,” and a joint resolution on D.C. taxes.  While these are not directly related to immigration, immigration enforcement funding and DHS nominations have dominated floor debate in prior weeks, and GOP leaders have indicated they will use suspension days (Mon-Wed) to advance additional DHS oversight measures.  Omar’s Feb 4 floor speech pledging articles of impeachment against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and calling to abolish ICE virtually guarantees that any DHS-related rule or amendment will draw prolonged floor discussion in which Omar participates (Omar press release, 4 Feb 2026).  With TV cameras on for those votes, her remarks can easily become viral moments.  
• OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE ACTIVITY.  Staff attorneys for the House Oversight Committee have already opened an inquiry into Omar’s family finances (WJAR, 17 Jan 2026).  While no public hearing is on the docket yet, investigators are “exploring the extraordinary step of subpoenaing Omar’s spouse.”  The committee traditionally meets on Wednesdays; if subpoenas are approved in executive session on 11 Feb, that would be a media flash-point.  
• POTENTIAL SPECIAL RESOLUTIONS.  GOP back-benchers have repeatedly introduced censure or expulsion resolutions aimed at Omar in past Congresses.  Given the town-hall attack and her impeachment call against Noem, leadership could allow debate on a resolution either commending Capitol Police for member safety or condemning Omar’s rhetoric.  Either scenario would guarantee floor time for Omar between 5 Feb and 14 Feb and keep her in headlines.

2.  Minnesota events, local protests or travel  
• TOWN-HALL FALLOUT.  Omar’s 28 Jan Minneapolis town hall—where she was sprayed with liquid from a syringe—continues to dominate Minnesota coverage (Democracy Now, 5 Feb 2026; Al Jazeera, 28 Jan 2026).  The suspect, Anthony Kazmierczak, is still awaiting formal county charges (PBS, 28 Jan 2026).  Any arraignment, new forensic results on the liquid, or federal assault-on-a-member-of-Congress charges could break between 5 Feb and 14 Feb.  Omar will almost certainly comment, especially because the Capitol Police have publicly vowed “swift justice” (PBS, 28 Jan 2026).  
• ON-GOING ICE PROTESTS.  Large demonstrations against “Operation Metro Surge”—ICE’s Minneapolis crackdown that has already resulted in two civilian deaths—are continuing.  Omar physically joined protesters on 10 Jan after being denied access to the Whipple Building ICE facility (New York Post, 10 Jan 2026).  Activist networks have been calling for another mass protest on Saturday 7 Feb; if she appears, local footage could again become national news just before the House’s Monday session.  
• NO SCHEDULED DISTRICT EVENTS POSTED.  Omar’s official House web site lists no Minnesota appearances in the 5–14 Feb window.  Given the recent security incident, staff may be waiting to post them, or they may keep her in D.C. until the recess begins 16 Feb.

3.  Federal investigations, lawsuits and other controversies  
• DOJ PROBE INTO FINANCES.  President Trump publicly confirmed on 26 Jan that DOJ “is investigating” Omar’s “accumulation of significant wealth” (Federal News Network, 26 Jan 2026).  Even absent concrete legal developments, any leak, subpoena or grand-jury sighting will spark coverage.  On prediction markets Omar is now the “fifth most likely member of Congress to be charged with a federal crime in 2026,” which press routinely treats as a story in itself (same source).  
• HOUSE GOP INVESTIGATION.  In parallel, House Oversight’s staff probe is examining how the couple’s reported net worth grew to as much as $30 million in 2024 (WJAR, 17 Jan 2026).  Chairman Comer has said Omar and husband Tim Mynett “will get their due process.”  A public letter, subpoena or document request between 5 Feb and 14 Feb would be picked up instantly by Hill outlets.  
• IMPEACHMENT THREATS AGAINST DHS SECRETARY.  Omar stated on the House floor 4 Feb that unless Kristi Noem resigns “we are going to introduce articles of impeachment” (Omar House press release, 4 Feb 2026).  Drafting and filing such articles would trigger House‐wide debate and ensure media focus on the sponsor—especially because GOP leaders would relish debating them.  
• SECURITY & POLITICAL VIOLENCE.  The Capitol Police reported 14,938 “concerning statements” against Members in 2025, a 58 % jump, and singled out Omar’s attack as emblematic (KOMU/CNN, 28 Jan 2026).  Any Capitol Police security update or new threat report citing Omar will create headlines, further elevating her.

Credible catalysts likely to drive media coverage (chronological window 5–14 Feb 2026)

1.  Thur 5 Feb – Mon 9 Feb: Follow-up law-enforcement actions in Minneapolis (charging decision on Kazmierczak; forensic report on the liquid).  
2.  Fri 6 Feb: Possible protest in Minneapolis tied to ICE operation; Omar appearance would be immediate news.  
3.  Mon 9 Feb – Thu 13 Feb: Floor debate on DHS, immigration or resolutions where Omar speaks; potential filing of impeachment articles against Kristi Noem.  
4.  Wed 11 Feb: Regular Oversight Committee day; possibility of subpoena vote involving Omar’s spouse or Minnesota DHS issues.  
5.  Any day: DOJ subpoena leak, Oversight Committee press release, or Trump social-media post about Omar finances—each would propel another news cycle.

Information gaps

• Exact DAILY House floor schedule for 5–14 Feb (specific bills, suspension calendar, special orders).  The public “Leader’s Weekly Schedule” for that span has not yet been posted.  
• Oversight Committee’s published agenda (if any) for the week of 10 Feb.  
• Minnesota protest calendars or Omar’s district schedule beyond press reports.  
• Status of potential articles of impeachment text and co-sponsors.  
• Whether Capitol Police or DOJ plan to file federal assault charges against Kazmierczak during the period.

If precision on those points becomes necessary, fresh targeted searches—e.g., “house majority leader weekly schedule feb 2026”, “committee repository oversight feb 2026 hearing”, or “anthony kazmierczak federal charges” would likely close the gaps.

Overall, even without additional events, the combination of: (a) Omar’s highly publicized town-hall attack; (b) her aggressive push against DHS leadership; and (c) dual financial investigations ensures that reporters will be tracking her every appearance and vote during the 5 – 14 Feb window.  Any move on immigration, DHS funding, or member security inside the House chamber is almost certain to elevate coverage of her role.</Agent_report>
