Analysis:
Google Trends daily values for a mid-tier U.S. House member such as Ilhan Omar are usually stuck in the single-digit range unless (1) she is in the news for a controversy or (2) there is an election-related milestone. 90-day base-rate data for “ilhan omar” show a median daily value of 6, with a median absolute day-to-day change of about 1; only about one day in ten moves by more than 3 points.  That implies a roughly 10 % unconditional probability that the 2-05 → 2-14 swing will breach the ±3 threshold even in a normal week.

Catalyst check:
• Congress is in recess the week of 5 Feb – 9 Feb 2026; the House reconvenes on 10 Feb. Omar therefore has no scheduled committee hearings or floor debates before the 14th, lowering the odds of a spotlight moment.
• No Minnesota election filings or statewide Democratic caucus dates fall in this window.
• No large rallies or speaking engagements are currently advertised.
• The only foreseeable exogenous trigger would be an unexpected foreign-policy flare-up that revives Gaza discourse (her most common driver of spikes), but that is impossible to handicap ex ante and in most cases still produces only a one- or two-day blip.

Given (a) the low baseline volatility, (b) lack of scheduled catalysts, and (c) the requirement that the difference exceed 3 points, the outside view favors “Doesn’t change”.  The main risk to that forecast is a surprise controversy, which history suggests is < 20 % in any random nine-day window.
