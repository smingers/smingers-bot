The fighter, known as 'El Matador,' shared videos on social media showing his return to training alongside Javi Climent, with Omar Montes present, signaling the start of his preparation for a highly anticipated bout against current interim lightweight champion Justin Gaethje. Topuria had previously stepped away from the spotlight in late 2025 after being involved in a legal process with his ex-partner, Giorgina Uzcategui. He confirmed his return window will be between April and June 2026, pending decisions from Dana White and UFC leadership. The potential fight is set to headline a historic event at the White House on June 14, 2026, commemorating the 250th anniversary of the United States and the 80th birthday of former President Donald Trump. A victory would allow Topuria to defend titles in both featherweight and lightweight divisions, and potentially pursue a move to welterweight to challenge Islam Makhachev, aiming to become the first triple champion in UFC history.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 01:58 PM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/edicion/20260205/ilia-topuria-anuncia-regreso-ufc-meses-despues-paron-temas-personales-campeon-vuelta/1003744118284_16.html)\n\n**Man who sprayed apple cider vinegar on Rep. Ilhan Omar ordered to remain in custody**\nAnthony Kazmierczak, 55, was ordered by a federal judge to remain in custody pending further court proceedings after being accused of assaulting Representative Ilhan Omar during a town hall in Minneapolis on January 27, 2026. During the incident, Kazmierczak charged toward Omar and sprayed her with a liquid later identified as apple cider vinegar and water; she was not injured. He was tackled and arrested, and Omar continued speaking and taking questions for nearly 30 minutes afterward. Kazmierczak faces federal assault charges and state charges of making threats of violence and assault. According to a federal complaint, a close associate reported that Kazmierczak once said, 'Somebody should kill that b****' about Omar. In a WCCO interview, Omar stated she is 'really OK' and emphasized, 'What happened to me is not OK, but they picked the wrong person. I am not one to be intimidated.' Omar, a Democrat, had called for the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement and the resignation of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem during the event. U.S. Capitol Police reported a 58% increase in threats against members of Congress, their families, and staff between 2024 and 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 01:35 PM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/anthony-kazmierczak-ilhan-omar-assault-ordered-to-remain-in-custody/)\n\n**Ilhan Omar Calls ICE a 'Rogue, Unlawful Paramilitary Force' Occupying Minneapolis (VIDEO) | The Gateway Pundit | by Mike LaChance**\nRepresentative Ilhan Omar stated in a public address that Minneapolis is under 'occupation' by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), describing ICE as a 'rogue, unlawful paramilitary force.' She cited multiple claims to support her assertion, including students fearing school, people avoiding hospitals due to the presence of federal agents, restaurant closures from transportation disruptions, and residents hiding others out of fear of returning home. Omar referenced two constituents shot by federal agents, noting their president discredited the footage and called for accountability for Stephen Miller, whom she blames for the 'terror' in Minneapolis and other cities. She also called for Kristi Noem's removal.

This marked a further escalation in Trump's ongoing attacks against Representative Ilhan Omar, a Democrat from Minnesota, who was born in Somalia and became the first Somali-American elected to Congress in 2018. Trump has repeatedly called for Omar\u2019s deportation, mocked her hijab, and made xenophobic remarks about Somali-Americans, including labeling them 'garbage' and accusing them of widespread fraud. There is no evidence linking Omar to ISIS. Her office has not commented, but she has previously condemned Trump\u2019s rhetoric as 'hateful' and said it has led to death threats. Tensions have intensified since immigration enforcement operations targeted the Somali-American community in Minnesota. Omar has advocated for the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), accusing officers of law violations. She and her family fled Somalia during the civil war and sought asylum in the U.S. in 1995, eventually settling in Minnesota. In a recent incident, she was sprayed with vinegar during a press conference while denouncing aggressive immigration enforcement, which she attributed to Trump\u2019s obsession with her.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 10:04 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-ilhan-omar-isis-feud-b2913331.html)\n\n**Judge declines to release man accused of spraying vinegar on Omar at town hall**\nAnthony Kazmierczak, 55, accused of spraying Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) with a vinegar-and-water mixture during a town hall in her district on January 27, 2026, was denied release by U.S. District Judge David T. Schultz in Minneapolis on February 3, 2026. The incident occurred as Kazmierczak advanced toward Omar at a lectern, shouting, 'She's not resigning,' and 'You're splitting Minnesotans apart,' before being subdued by two security officers. A criminal complaint revealed Kazmierczak had previously made threats against Omar, including allegedly stating 'somebody should kill' her years earlier. Court records show he has a history of arrests, including a 1989 felony conviction for motor vehicle theft and multiple DUI charges. Social media posts indicate support for conservative causes and Donald Trump, with Kazmierczak referring to Democrats as 'angry and liars' and criticizing former President Biden. While Democrats and several GOP lawmakers condemned the attack, Trump claimed it was staged without evidence. House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) stated he had no evidence of a conspiracy, noting he contacted Omar following the incident. Omar later posted on X that she was unharmed and resilient, saying, 'I'm a survivor, so this small agitator isn't going to intimidate me from doing my work. I don't let bullies win.

She reported that some residents are housing others out of fear of returning home, and referenced two constituents shot by federal agents, whose deaths were dismissed by the president. Omar called for immediate resignation of Governor Kristi Noem and accountability for Stephen Miller, whom she identified as the 'architect of the terror' in Minneapolis and other cities. She emphasized that Democrats are prepared to impeach Noem if she does not resign and the president does not fire her, and reiterated the demand to remove ICE from cities and dismantle what she described as an unlawful federal presence.

The suspect, 55-year-old Anthony Kazmierczak, was arrested and charged with third-degree assault by the Minneapolis Police Department. In response, Donald Trump claimed, 'She probably had herself sprayed, knowing her,' despite admitting he had not seen the video of the incident. He also labeled her a 'fraud.' Omar responded on X (formerly Twitter), accusing Trump of 'deflecting from your failures with lies and conspiracy theories about me.' Social media users widely condemned Trump\u2019s remarks, with many calling his statement 'dangerous,' 'incomprehensible,' and part of a pattern of spreading misinformation. Reactions included 'Is he joking?', 'This is how misinformation spreads,' and 'Minimizing and waiving off an attack on a minority.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 11:53 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/social-media-slams-donald-trump-073059795.html)\n\n**Rising: February 2, 2026**\nOn February 2, 2026, The Hill published a roundup of political and cultural developments under the RISING headline.

Robby Soave reported that former CNN journalist Don Lemon was arrested and charged for participating in a protest at a church in St. Paul, Minnesota, related to anti-ICE activism, sparking debate over free speech. President Donald Trump threatened to sue Michael Wolff, alleging conspiracy with Jeffrey Epstein to damage Trump\u2019s political career. Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned that any U.S. military attack on Iran would trigger a 'regional war' in the Middle East.

In Texas, Democrat Taylor Rehmet won a surprise runoff victory in a district that President Trump had won by 17 points in 2024, signaling potential midterm implications.

Trump criticized Minnesota Governor Tim Walz as either 'the most CORRUPT government official in history' or 'the most INCOMPETENT,' stating even individuals with low IQs should have recognized the fraud. The claim is tied to a House Oversight Committee investigation into Omar and Mynett\u2019s finances, with reports indicating their net worth ranged from $6 million to $30 million by the end of 2024. Rep. James Comer (R-KY) announced plans to subpoena Mynett.

Ilhan Omar attacked, sprayed with unknown substance at town hall meeting**\nRep. Ilhan Omar, D-Minn., was attacked and sprayed with an unknown substance during a town hall meeting on January 28, 2026, shortly after she called for Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem to resign or be impeached. The incident occurred amid heightened political tensions following a fatal shooting by an ICE agent in Minneapolis and ongoing investigations into government services fraud involving Somali immigrants and others in Minnesota. Omar, who was born in Somalia and became a U.S. citizen in 2000, was confronted by Anthony Kazmierczak, 55, who was arrested on charges of third-degree assault. Security guards subdued the man, and Omar continued her speech, stating, 'Don't let them have the show,' in defiance of the disruption. The attack drew bipartisan condemnation from lawmakers across party lines, who denounced political violence. President Donald Trump, however, dismissed the incident, telling ABC News he 'doesn't think about her' and suggesting she 'probably had herself sprayed, knowing her.' The event is part of a broader trend: U.S. Capitol Police reported nearly 15,000 potential threats against lawmakers, family members, or the Capitol in 2025\u2014a 57% increase from 2024\u2019s 9,474 threats, with numbers rising from 7,501 in 2022 and 8,008 in 2023.

The surge in search volume was driven by widespread public engagement with the episode\u2019s plot developments and extensive praise for Essam Omar\u2019s performance, which is considered one of his most prominent dramatic roles.

Lahren declared Omar 'the perfect poster child for why we need a closed border,' claiming she represents 'people from third-world countries who have no respect for this country, no respect for our laws and those who enforce them.' Lahren further accused Democrats of favoring undocumented immigrants by supporting their access to driver's licenses while opposing such rights for ICE agents, whom she labeled 'a**holes.' The clip also prompted backlash from far-right figures: Laura Loomer demanded Omar be deported, Senator Mike Lee expressed outrage, and Elon Musk suggested she be tried for treason. Former Congressman George Santos called Omar 'the enemy within' and claimed she prioritizes Somalis in Minnesota over the United States. Omar has long been a target of conservative criticism, notably after her June 2025 remarks denouncing ICE operations in Los Angeles as resembling a dictatorship. Tensions escalated in Minnesota following the fatal shooting of 37-year-old mother Renee Nicole Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis. President Donald Trump deployed 3,000 ICE agents to the state, prompting mass protests, with Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey demanding they 'get the f*** out.' Trump threatened to invoke the Insurrection Act, and Governor Tim Walz placed the National Guard on standby. The Department of Justice launched an investigation into Frey and Walz for allegedly obstructing federal law enforcement, which Frey dismissed as 'ridiculous' and described as a 'siege' on his city.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 19, 2026 01:03 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/ilhan-omar-tomi-lahren-fox-news-b2903185.html)\n\n**Essam Omar Tops Trends with New Action-Comedy Series 'Champion of the World'**\nActor Essam Omar has topped social media trends following the announcement of his new series 'Batal al-Alam' (Champion of the World), set to premiere this month, blending action and comedy.

Ilhan Omar (D-Minn.) will be denaturalized and deported by the Trump administration in 2026. Wheeler cites two main grounds for this prediction: first, that Omar married her brother, Elmi, in a civil ceremony after previously being married in a religious ceremony to Hirsi, a claim she presents as 'pretty airtight evidence' based on a Daily Mail article; second, that Omar\u2019s father, who claimed asylum in the U.S. due to persecution under Somalia\u2019s communist Marxist regime, was actually a member of that regime and worked in propaganda, making the asylum claim potentially fraudulent. Wheeler asserts that if Omar\u2019s naturalization was based on a lie, her citizenship should be revoked. She further notes that border czar Tom Homan has confirmed Omar is under investigation for immigration fraud, stating he is 'running it down this week.' Wheeler concludes by jokingly urging Homan to 'make my 2026 prediction come true.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 16, 2025 05:00 PM\nSource:[TheBlaze](https://www.theblaze.com/shows/the-liz-wheeler-show/prediction-ilhan-omar-will-be-deported-in-2026)\n\n**'You Will Respect Our President!' Ilhan Omar Defended Trump Hard When an EU Diplomat Ripped Him**\nAccording to Rep. Anna Paulina Luna (R-FL), Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN) defended former President Donald Trump during a April 2025 meeting with European Union officials, specifically confronting a Belgian diplomat who criticized Trump's perceived lack of respect for the EU. Luna recounted on the PBD Podcast that Omar, staring down the diplomat, declared, 'You might not like what our president is doing, and you might not agree with our foreign policy. But when we're here, you will respect our president!' Luna said the moment 'blew me away' and praised Omar for presenting a 'united front' against a foreign 'jerk from Belgium.' This defense stands in stark contrast to Omar\u2019s prior public statements: earlier in October 2025, she labeled Trump an 'embarrassing, racist, corrupt liar,' and in March 2025, she denounced MAGA supporters as 'racist and xenophobic.' Trump, in turn, had previously called Omar a 'disgraceful person' in response to her reaction to conservative influencer Charlie Kirk\u2019s shooting. The incident was reported by Mediaite on October 26, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 26, 2025 06:19 PM\nSource:[Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/you-will-respect-our-president-ilhan-omar-defended-trump-hard-when-a-european-diplomat-trashed-him-gop-congresswoman-claims/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
