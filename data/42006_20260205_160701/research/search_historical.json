This event falls within the forecast period (February 5-14, 2026) and could potentially drive increased Google search interest in \"ilhan omar\" during that timeframe.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Upcoming House schedule Ilhan Omar February 2026; check planned appearances, controversies, or votes that could elevate media coverage between 5 Feb and 14 Feb 2026.  Prioritize official House calendar, Minnesota events, and major national stories involving Omar.  Summarize any credible catalysts.\nBetween 5 Feb and 14 Feb 2026, several converging story lines suggest that Rep. Ilhan Omar (D-MN-05) will remain a heavy focus of national press.  The catalysts fall into three broad buckets\u2014(1) the official House schedule, (2) Minnesota-based events and protests, and (3) federal or congressional investigations and other controversies.  Each bucket is summarized below, followed by any outstanding information gaps.\n\n1.  Official House calendar, floor votes and committee work  \n\u2022 SESSION DAYS.  The House is in legislative session the week beginning Monday 2 Feb and\u2014barring last-minute changes\u2014normally works straight through the Thursday of the following week before adjourning for the Presidents\u2019 Day recess that starts Monday 16 Feb.  House calendars published for 2 Feb and 3 Feb confirm business on the floor (rules meeting on 2 Feb; Calendar of the House dated 3 Feb) and there is no announced district work period until 16 Feb, meaning Omar will likely be in Washington for votes from 5 Feb to 13 Feb (GovInfo House calendar for 3 Feb 2026; House.gov daily schedule for 2 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 IMMIGRATION/ICE-RELATED LEGISLATION.  The 2 Feb Rules Committee meeting lists H.R. 4090, the \u201cCritical Mineral Dominance Act,\u201d and a joint resolution on D.C. taxes.  While these are not directly related to immigration, immigration enforcement funding and DHS nominations have dominated floor debate in prior weeks, and GOP leaders have indicated they will use suspension days (Mon-Wed) to advance additional DHS oversight measures.  Omar\u2019s Feb 4 floor speech pledging articles of impeachment against DHS Secretary Kristi Noem and calling to abolish ICE virtually guarantees that any DHS-related rule or amendment will draw prolonged floor discussion in which Omar participates (Omar press release, 4 Feb 2026).  With TV cameras on for those votes, her remarks can easily become viral moments.  \n\u2022 OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE ACTIVITY.  Staff attorneys for the House Oversight Committee have already opened an inquiry into Omar\u2019s family finances (WJAR, 17 Jan 2026).  While no public hearing is on the docket yet, investigators are \u201cexploring the extraordinary step of subpoenaing Omar\u2019s spouse.\u201d  The committee traditionally meets on Wednesdays; if subpoenas are approved in executive session on 11 Feb, that would be a media flash-point.  \n\u2022 POTENTIAL SPECIAL RESOLUTIONS.  GOP back-benchers have repeatedly introduced censure or expulsion resolutions aimed at Omar in past Congresses.  Given the town-hall attack and her impeachment call against Noem, leadership could allow debate on a resolution either commending Capitol Police for member safety or condemning Omar\u2019s rhetoric.  Either scenario would guarantee floor time for Omar between 5 Feb and 14 Feb and keep her in headlines.\n\n2.  Minnesota events, local protests or travel  \n\u2022 TOWN-HALL FALLOUT.  Omar\u2019s 28 Jan Minneapolis town hall\u2014where she was sprayed with liquid from a syringe\u2014continues to dominate Minnesota coverage (Democracy Now, 5 Feb 2026; Al Jazeera, 28 Jan 2026).  The suspect, Anthony Kazmierczak, is still awaiting formal county charges (PBS, 28 Jan 2026).  Any arraignment, new forensic results on the liquid, or federal assault-on-a-member-of-Congress charges could break between 5 Feb and 14 Feb.  Omar will almost certainly comment, especially because the Capitol Police have publicly vowed \u201cswift justice\u201d (PBS, 28 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 ON-GOING ICE PROTESTS.  Large demonstrations against \u201cOperation Metro Surge\u201d\u2014ICE\u2019s Minneapolis crackdown that has already resulted in two civilian deaths\u2014are continuing.  Omar physically joined protesters on 10 Jan after being denied access to the Whipple Building ICE facility (New York Post, 10 Jan 2026).  Activist networks have been calling for another mass protest on Saturday 7 Feb; if she appears, local footage could again become national news just before the House\u2019s Monday session.  \n\u2022 NO SCHEDULED DISTRICT EVENTS POSTED.  Omar\u2019s official House web site lists no Minnesota appearances in the 5\u201314 Feb window.  Given the recent security incident, staff may be waiting to post them, or they may keep her in D.C. until the recess begins 16 Feb.\n\n3.  Federal investigations, lawsuits and other controversies  \n\u2022 DOJ PROBE INTO FINANCES.  President Trump publicly confirmed on 26 Jan that DOJ \u201cis investigating\u201d Omar\u2019s \u201caccumulation of significant wealth\u201d (Federal News Network, 26 Jan 2026).  Even absent concrete legal developments, any leak, subpoena or grand-jury sighting will spark coverage.  On prediction markets Omar is now the \u201cfifth most likely member of Congress to be charged with a federal crime in 2026,\u201d which press routinely treats as a story in itself (same source).  \n\u2022 HOUSE GOP INVESTIGATION.  In parallel, House Oversight\u2019s staff probe is examining how the couple\u2019s reported net worth grew to as much as $30 million in 2024 (WJAR, 17 Jan 2026).  Chairman Comer has said Omar and husband Tim Mynett \u201cwill get their due process.\u201d  A public letter, subpoena or document request between 5 Feb and 14 Feb would be picked up instantly by Hill outlets.  \n\u2022 IMPEACHMENT THREATS AGAINST DHS SECRETARY.  Omar stated on the House floor 4 Feb that unless Kristi Noem resigns \u201cwe are going to introduce articles of impeachment\u201d (Omar House press release, 4 Feb 2026).  Drafting and filing such articles would trigger House\u2010wide debate and ensure media focus on the sponsor\u2014especially because GOP leaders would relish debating them.  \n\u2022 SECURITY & POLITICAL VIOLENCE.  The Capitol Police reported 14,938 \u201cconcerning statements\u201d against Members in 2025, a 58 % jump, and singled out Omar\u2019s attack as emblematic (KOMU/CNN, 28 Jan 2026).  Any Capitol Police security update or new threat report citing Omar will create headlines, further elevating her.\n\nCredible catalysts likely to drive media coverage (chronological window 5\u201314 Feb 2026)\n\n1.  Thur 5 Feb \u2013 Mon 9 Feb: Follow-up law-enforcement actions in Minneapolis (charging decision on Kazmierczak; forensic report on the liquid).  \n2.  Fri 6 Feb: Possible protest in Minneapolis tied to ICE operation; Omar appearance would be immediate news.  \n3.  Mon 9 Feb \u2013 Thu 13 Feb: Floor debate on DHS, immigration or resolutions where Omar speaks; potential filing of impeachment articles against Kristi Noem.  \n4.  Wed 11 Feb: Regular Oversight Committee day; possibility of subpoena vote involving Omar\u2019s spouse or Minnesota DHS issues.  \n5.  Any day: DOJ subpoena leak, Oversight Committee press release, or Trump social-media post about Omar finances\u2014each would propel another news cycle.\n\nInformation gaps\n\n\u2022 Exact DAILY House floor schedule for 5\u201314 Feb (specific bills, suspension calendar, special orders).  The public \u201cLeader\u2019s Weekly Schedule\u201d for that span has not yet been posted.  \n\u2022 Oversight Committee\u2019s published agenda (if any) for the week of 10 Feb.  \n\u2022 Minnesota protest calendars or Omar\u2019s district schedule beyond press reports.  \n\u2022 Status of potential articles of impeachment text and co-sponsors.  \n\u2022 Whether Capitol Police or DOJ plan to file federal assault charges against Kazmierczak during the period.\n\nIf precision on those points becomes necessary, fresh targeted searches\u2014e.g., \u201chouse majority leader weekly schedule feb 2026\u201d, \u201ccommittee repository oversight feb 2026 hearing\u201d, or \u201canthony kazmierczak federal charges\u201d would likely close the gaps.\n\nOverall, even without additional events, the combination of: (a) Omar\u2019s highly publicized town-hall attack; (b) her aggressive push against DHS leadership; and (c) dual financial investigations ensures that reporters will be tracking her every appearance and vote during the 5 \u2013 14 Feb window.  Any move on immigration, DHS funding, or member security inside the House chamber is almost certain to elevate coverage of her role.</Agent_report>\n\n<GoogleTrendsData term=\"ilhan omar\">\nError retrieving data: 429 Client Error: unknown for url: https://trends.google.com/trends/api/widgetdata/multiline?req=%7B%22time%22%3A+%222025-11-07+2026-02-05%22%2C+%22resolution%22%3A+%22DAY%22%2C+%22locale%22%3A+%22en-US%22%2C+%22comparisonItem%22%3A+%5B%7B%22geo%22%3A+%7B%22country%22%3A+%22US%22%7D%2C+%22complexKeywordsRestriction%22%3A+%7B%22keyword%22%3A+%5B%7B%22type%22%3A+%22BROAD%22%2C+%22value%22%3A+%22ilhan+omar%22%7D%5D%7D%7D%5D%2C+%22requestOptions%22%3A+%7B%22property%22%3A+%22%22%2C+%22backend%22%3A+%22IZG%22%2C+%22category%22%3A+0%7D%2C+%22userConfig%22%3A+%7B%22userType%22%3A+%22USER_TYPE_EMBED_OVER_QUOTA%22%7D%7D&token=ABnFJDYAAAAAaYYRt2Qhc4WFJjBBWtPfABt_bYy_1RhJ&hl=en&tz=360\n</GoogleTrendsData>\n"
