## Forecast Analysis: Overnight Unsecured AMERIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate on 2026-02-12

### 1. Target Variable Paraphrase
AMERIBOR overnight rate (%) on Feb 12, 2026, published by FRED.

### 2. Source Analysis

**Historical Context Sources:**

**FOMC Statement (Jan 28, 2026):** Federal Reserve maintained fed funds target at 3.50-3.75%. High quality, official source. **Factual**: Rate held steady. **Opinion**: Two members dissented preferring cuts. This is highly relevant - EFFR stability anchors AMERIBOR.

**FRED Data (through Feb 4, 2026):** Shows AMERIBOR at 3.65076% on Feb 4. Highest quality (official data), most recent available, directly relevant.

**Federal Reserve H.15 Report:** EFFR stable at 3.64% (Jan 28-Feb 3). Official data, highest reliability, critical anchor point.

**Term-30 AMERIBOR (Jan 29-Feb 4):** Ranged 3.73605-3.74643%. Official FRED data, suggests forward expectations for overnight rate to remain elevated.

**AskNews Articles:**

Most articles discuss **other** benchmark rates (Euribor, UK rates, India rates, Brazil DI rates) - not directly relevant to US AMERIBOR. These are **weak evidence** at best, showing global central bank trends but with no causal link to AMERIBOR.

**Key exception - Bank of England (Feb 5, 2026):** Held rate at 3.75% with close vote. This is contemporaneous but affects UK markets, not US overnight rates. **Irrelevant** for AMERIBOR prediction.

**American Banker article (Jan 2025):** Discusses AFX acquisition. **Factual**: AMERIBOR is credit-sensitive, appeals to regional banks. **No rate predictions**. Provides context on AMERIBOR's nature but no forecasting value.

**Critical Gap:** No news articles specifically discuss AMERIBOR movements or expectations for Feb 2026. This suggests market stability/lack of newsworthy volatility.

### 3. Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **EFFR stability at 3.64%** (Jan 28-Feb 3): Official Fed data showing anchor rate unchanged. AMERIBOR tracks EFFR closely with small spread. This is the strongest anchor.
- **Recent AMERIBOR trend**: 3.67332% (Jan 29) → 3.65076% (Feb 4) = -2.26 bps over 4 business days, converging toward EFFR. Direct, recent data.
- **No policy changes scheduled**: Next FOMC meeting not until March. Structural factor ensuring stability.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Term-30 AMERIBOR at ~3.74%**: Forward curve suggests market expects overnight rate in 3.65-3.75% range. Indirect indicator but logical.
- **Historical AMERIBOR-EFFR spread**: Typically 1-5 bps during normal periods. Current 1 bp spread is at lower end, suggesting either stability or slight mean reversion upward.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Global rate trends**: Other countries' benchmark movements have no direct causal link to US overnight unsecured lending rates.
- **AFX acquisition news**: Structural change but no impact on near-term rate levels.

### 4. Timeframe Analysis

**Forecast Horizon:** 7 calendar days (Feb 5-12), approximately 5 business days.

**If halved to 3.5 days:** Distribution would tighten significantly. Overnight rates exhibit very low volatility over 2-3 business days absent shocks. 80% CI might compress to 5-8 bps.

**If doubled to 14 days:** Slightly wider distribution to account for potential end-of-month liquidity effects, quarter-end positioning, or unexpected economic data. However, still no policy meetings, so widening would be modest. 80% CI might expand to 15-20 bps.

**Current 7-day forecast:** Intermediate volatility. Sufficient time for small technical adjustments but insufficient for structural changes absent policy shifts.

### 5. Justification and Base Rate Adjustment

**Outside View Base Rate:** 3.60-3.70% with center at 3.65%

**Key Adjustment Factors:**

1. **EFFR Anchor (Strong):** With EFFR locked at 3.64% and no policy changes, AMERIBOR has a gravitational center. The current 1 bp spread is narrow historically.

2. **Recent Convergence Trend (Moderate):** The -2.26 bp move over 4 days suggests gradual compression toward EFFR. Extrapolating linearly (risky but informative): another 5 business days might see additional 2-3 bp decline, putting AMERIBOR at 3.62-3.63%.

3. **Credit-Sensitive Nature (Moderate):** AMERIBOR reflects unsecured interbank lending risk. During calm periods, spread narrows. Current market shows no stress signals. However, AMERIBOR rarely trades *below* EFFR for extended periods - this provides a soft floor.

4. **Forward Curve Signal (Moderate):** Term-30 at 3.74% is ~9 bps above current overnight. This suggests either (a) market expects slight upward drift in overnight rate, or (b) term premium. Given stable policy, likely reflects normal term structure rather than expected overnight rate increase.

**Distribution Calibration:**

- **Central tendency:** 3.63-3.65% (continuing gradual convergence toward EFFR)
- **Downside:** Limited by EFFR floor at 3.64%. AMERIBOR rarely trades below EFFR. Absolute floor ~3.60% (4 bps below EFFR) represents extreme compression.
- **Upside:** Mean reversion in spread could push back to 3.68-3.70%. Unexpected liquidity tightness could widen spread to 3.72-3.75%.
- **Tail risks:** 
  - **Left tail:** Unexpected Fed technical adjustment or extreme liquidity abundance: 3.55-3.60%
  - **Right tail:** Bank stress or liquidity squeeze: 3.75-3.80%

**Confidence Assessment:** High confidence in 3.60-3.70% range (90%+ probability). The stable policy environment, recent data, and short timeframe all support low volatility. However, maintaining humility about unknown unknowns (technical market factors, unexpected liquidity events).

### Forecasting Checklist

1. ✓ **Target**: AMERIBOR overnight % on Feb 12, 2026
2. ✓ **Base rate**: 3.60-3.70%, centered at 3.65%
3. **Consistency**: Implied median = 3.64%; mean ≈ 3.645%. Makes sense given recent convergence trend toward EFFR (3.64%) with slight upward skew from credit premium.
4. **Key Evidence**:
   - EFFR stable at 3.64% with no policy changes scheduled
   - AMERIBOR at 3.65% on Feb 4, down from 3.67% on Jan 29
   - Term-30 AMERIBOR at 3.74% suggesting range-bound expectations
   - Historical 1-5 bp spread over EFFR during normal periods
   - Current 1 bp spread at lower end of historical range
5. **Blind spot**: Unexpected liquidity shock in regional banking sector (AMERIBOR's core market) could widen spread dramatically, pushing outcome to 3.75-3.85%. This would make forecast look too narrow. Direction: **UP**.

### Final Calibration

Given:
- Strong anchor at EFFR (3.64%)
- Recent downward drift suggesting continuation
- Credit premium preventing sustained trading below EFFR
- Short timeframe limiting volatility
- No policy catalysts

I'm setting a distribution that:
- Centers slightly below current 3.65% (at 3.64%) reflecting convergence
- Maintains modest right skew (credit-sensitive nature)
- Keeps 80% interval at ~10 bps (reasonable for 5 business days)
- Allows tail risk for unexpected events
