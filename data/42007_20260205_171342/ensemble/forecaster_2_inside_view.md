## 1. Target Variable Paraphrase
Overnight Unsecured AMERIBOR rate (%) on February 12, 2026, seven days ahead.

## 2. Source Analysis

**Primary Data Sources:**
- **FRED AMERIBOR series (through 2026-02-04)**: High-quality primary data showing most recent value of 3.67332% on 2026-01-29. Factual, authoritative. Published 1 day before analysis date.
- **Federal Reserve FOMC Statement (2026-01-28)**: Factual policy announcement. Fed held rates at 3.50-3.75% range. High quality, directly relevant. 8 days old.
- **Agent report on AMERIBOR/EFFR relationship**: States AMERIBOR at 3.65076% on 2026-02-04, typically trades 1-2 bp above EFFR (3.64%). Factual observation with clear methodology.

**Contextual Sources:**
- **Chatham Financial article on AMERIBOR swaps**: Background on market development; no rate forecasts. Moderate quality, undated.
- **FRED categories page**: Confirms daily updates through 2026-02-04. Factual metadata only.

**News Articles (from AskNews):**
- **Bank of England rate decision (2026-02-05)**: UK-specific; not directly relevant to US money markets. Weak relevance.
- **Indian/Brazilian/European rate discussions**: Regional interest rate movements; no direct bearing on AMERIBOR. Weak relevance.
- **No articles specifically about AMERIBOR or US money market conditions in February 2026**.

**Key Factual Observations:**
1. Last AMERIBOR print: 3.67332% (Jan 29) or 3.65076% (Feb 4) - slight discrepancy in sources but both in 3.65-3.67% range
2. EFFR locked at 3.64% since July 2025
3. Fed held rates at January 28 meeting with no change signaled for near term
4. Historical spread: AMERIBOR trades 1-2 bp above EFFR
5. No FOMC meeting or major economic releases scheduled before Feb 12

## 3. Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Fed policy stability**: FOMC explicitly held rates on Jan 28, with minutes indicating careful assessment of data before future changes. No meeting before Feb 12. This anchors the effective fed funds rate, which in turn anchors AMERIBOR. (Multiple reliable sources confirming stable policy environment)
- **AMERIBOR-EFFR spread stability**: Historical pattern shows AMERIBOR consistently 1-2 bp above EFFR with low volatility. EFFR at 3.64% provides strong anchor. (Structural relationship with demonstrated stability)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Recent AMERIBOR levels**: Values between 3.65-3.67% in late January/early February establish current baseline. (Direct observation from primary source)
- **No scheduled catalysts**: Absence of policy meetings or major data releases in 7-day window reduces probability of large moves. (Institutional calendar factor)

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Global rate movements**: Various central banks adjusting rates, but these don't have direct mechanical links to overnight US unsecured interbank rates in a 7-day window. (Indirect, speculative connections)

## 4. Timeframe Analysis

**Current Timeframe: 7 days (5 business days)**

Historical volatility analysis:
- Standard 5-day move: ~2-3 basis points
- Typical daily moves: ±1-3 bp
- Rare extreme moves: 5-6 bp (funding stress events)

**If timeframe halved (3.5 days):**
- Would narrow distribution further (~1.5-2 bp standard deviation)
- Higher confidence in mean-reversion to current level
- Range: approximately 3.64-3.68%

**If timeframe doubled (14 days):**
- Would widen distribution (~4-5 bp standard deviation)
- Greater chance of capturing a data release or policy signal
- Increased tail risk from unexpected funding conditions
- Range: approximately 3.60-3.72%

## 5. Justification for Prediction Adjustment

**Base Rate Anchor: 3.66%** (midpoint of recent 3.65-3.67% range)

**Factors Supporting Narrow Distribution:**
1. **Policy stability**: Fed on hold with no near-term meeting
2. **Structural relationship**: AMERIBOR mechanically tied to EFFR via arbitrage
3. **Low historical volatility**: 5-day moves rarely exceed ±5 bp absent shocks
4. **No catalysts identified**: Clean calendar for next 7 days

**Factors Supporting Slight Widening vs. Outside View:**
1. **End-of-month effects**: Feb 12 is mid-month, but some reserve management dynamics possible
2. **Liquidity variations**: Daily funding needs can cause 2-3 bp intraday swings
3. **Unknown unknowns**: Geopolitical events, bank-specific issues could emerge

**Distribution Calibration:**
- Mean: 3.66% (current level)
- Standard deviation: ~0.025% (2.5 bp) - slightly wider than pure statistical history to account for uncertainty
- 90% confidence interval: approximately 3.62-3.70% (±4 bp, representing ~1.6 standard deviations)

The outside view suggested ±5 bp for 90% interval. Current evidence supports a marginally tighter distribution (±4 bp) given:
- Very recent data points (within 6 days)
- Clear policy anchor
- No identified near-term catalysts

However, I maintain some caution against over-precision given:
- Potential for unexpected funding stress
- Reserve management dynamics
- Measurement timing (could catch day with slight technical deviation)

## 6. Consistency Check
Implied median ≈ 3.66%; mean ≈ 3.66%; this aligns with continuation of current stable regime with AMERIBOR tracking just above the 3.64% EFFR.

## 7. Key Evidence Summary
1. **Fed held rates Jan 28**: No policy change expected before Feb 12
2. **AMERIBOR at 3.65-3.67%**: Recent prints establish current baseline
3. **EFFR stable at 3.64%**: Provides structural anchor via arbitrage
4. **Low historical volatility**: 5-day moves typically ±2-3 bp
5. **No scheduled catalysts**: Clean calendar reduces shock probability

## 8. Blind-Spot Scenario
**Most likely miss**: Unexpected funding stress event (bank-specific issue, technical factor in repo markets, or surprise policy signal) causes 10+ bp spike. This would push outcome UPWARD to 3.75-3.80% range. Probability: ~5%.

Alternative miss: Unexpectedly dovish Fed communication or funding surplus drives AMERIBOR below EFFR temporarily. This would push outcome DOWNWARD to 3.60-3.62%. Probability: ~3%.

## Final Forecast

Given the strong anchoring from stable Fed policy, the mechanical relationship to EFFR, and absence of near-term catalysts, I forecast a tight distribution centered on current levels with modest tails for unexpected developments.
