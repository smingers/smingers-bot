Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Source 1: FRED Release Calendar (2026)**
- **Type**: Schedule listing from official Federal Reserve database
- **Quality**: High - official source
- **Date**: Shows January 2026 releases
- **Key Facts**: Confirms AMERIBOR publishes daily on business days; no actual rate values provided
- **Assessment**: Reliable for understanding data publication schedule but contains no predictive information

**Source 2: FRED AMBOR30T Series (February 2026)**
- **Type**: Historical data for 30-day term AMERIBOR
- **Quality**: High - official FRED data
- **Date**: Most recent data through 2026-02-04
- **Key Facts**: Term-30 rates ranged 3.73605% to 3.74643% in late January/early February 2026
- **Assessment**: While this is a different instrument (30-day forward vs overnight), it provides context on recent AMERIBOR levels. The Term-30 rate uses overnight AMERIBOR as an input, suggesting overnight rates in the high 3.6% to low 3.7% range during this period.

**Source 3: Federal Reserve H.15 Report (February 2026)**
- **Type**: Official Federal Reserve interest rate data
- **Quality**: Highest - primary source
- **Date**: January 28 - February 3, 2026
- **Key Facts**: Effective Federal Funds Rate stable at 3.64% throughout the period; broader rate environment shows short-term Treasury bills at 3.60-3.72%
- **Assessment**: Provides crucial context on the broader interest rate environment. AMERIBOR typically trades close to EFFR with a small credit spread.

**Source 4: American Banker Article on ICE Acquisition**
- **Type**: News article
- **Quality**: Medium-high - reputable financial publication
- **Date**: January 8, 2025 (over one year old)
- **Key Facts**: ICE acquired AFX (operator of AMERIBOR); AMERIBOR is credit-sensitive and reflects actual overnight borrowing costs
- **Expert Opinion**: Industry experts view AMERIBOR as better suited for regional/community banks than SOFR
- **Assessment**: Provides institutional context but no predictive value for February 2026 rates

**Source 5: Investopedia LIBOR Article**
- **Type**: Educational reference
- **Quality**: Medium - general financial education
- **Date**: Not recent
- **Key Facts**: Background on benchmark rates; LIBOR phased out, replaced by SOFR
- **Assessment**: Not directly relevant to AMERIBOR prediction; provides general context only

**Agent Report: AMERIBOR vs EFFR Analysis**
- **Type**: Technical analysis methodology
- **Quality**: High - describes proper analytical approach
- **Date**: Current (references data through February 4, 2026)
- **Key Facts**: Confirms latest AMERIBOR at 3.65076% (Feb 4) and EFFR at 3.64% (Feb 3); notes AMERIBOR typically runs a few basis points above EFFR; describes both as moving closely together
- **Assessment**: Most relevant source for prediction; provides recent actual values and relationship dynamics

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **7-day forward AMERIBOR predictions during stable monetary policy periods**
   - Suitability: HIGH
   - Rationale: We're predicting 7 business days ahead (Feb 5 to Feb 12) during what appears to be a stable rate environment (EFFR constant at 3.64% from Jan 28-Feb 3)
   - Historical pattern: During stable periods, overnight rates show minimal day-to-day volatility

2. **AMERIBOR movements relative to EFFR**
   - Suitability: HIGH
   - Rationale: AMERIBOR tracks EFFR closely with a credit spread; EFFR is stable, suggesting AMERIBOR should remain stable
   - Historical pattern: Typical spread of a few basis points above EFFR

3. **Short-term interbank rate volatility in Q1 2026**
   - Suitability: MEDIUM
   - Rationale: Provides seasonal context but less specific
   - Historical pattern: Q1 typically shows moderate volatility around tax dates and quarter-end, but mid-February is usually calm

**Selected Reference Class**: 7-day forward predictions during stable monetary policy, combined with AMERIBOR-EFFR relationship analysis

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 7 calendar days (5 business days) from February 5 to February 12, 2026

**Recent Historical Pattern (last 180 days per Agent Report)**:
- Latest AMERIBOR: 3.65076% (Feb 4, 2026)
- Previous value from question: 3.67332% (Jan 29, 2026)
- EFFR: Stable at 3.64% (Jan 28-Feb 3, 2026)
- Term-30 AMERIBOR: 3.73605-3.74643% (Jan 29-Feb 4)

**Key Observations**:
1. AMERIBOR declined from 3.67332% (Jan 29) to 3.65076% (Feb 4) - a drop of ~2.3 basis points over 4 business days
2. EFFR remained perfectly stable at 3.64% throughout this period
3. AMERIBOR currently trading ~1 basis point above EFFR (very tight spread)
4. No indication of monetary policy changes in the 7-day forecast window
5. Mid-February typically lacks major financial market disruptions (no quarter-end, tax deadline, or FOMC meeting pressures)

## (d) Justification

The outside view prediction should center around the most recent observed value of 3.65076% with modest dispersion to account for:

**Factors Supporting Stability**:
- EFFR has been rock-solid at 3.64% for over a week
- No scheduled FOMC meetings or policy changes in the forecast window
- Mid-February is typically a quiet period for money markets
- The recent trend shows slight decline (from 3.67% to 3.65%), suggesting if anything a mild downward bias

**Factors Supporting Modest Volatility**:
- AMERIBOR is credit-sensitive and can respond to bank-specific funding pressures
- Daily fluctuations of ±5-10 basis points are not uncommon even in stable periods
- The spread to EFFR (currently ~1bp) can widen to 5-10bp under modest stress
- Unknown unknowns: bank liquidity events, technical factors in the AFX marketplace

**Baseline Expectation**: 
Given the 7-day horizon and stable backdrop, the most likely outcome is AMERIBOR remaining in a tight range around 3.65%, with the distribution centered slightly below current levels (continuing the recent mild downtrend) but with tail risks allowing for moves to 3.55-3.75%.

Outside view calibration:

The key calibration considerations:

1. **Central Tendency**: The most recent value (3.65076%) should anchor the distribution, but the slight downtrend from 3.67% to 3.65% suggests a median around 3.64-3.65%.

2. **90/10 Range Width**: For a 7-day forecast of an overnight rate during stable conditions:
   - Historical daily volatility in stable periods: ~2-5 basis points
   - Over 7 days, cumulative uncertainty increases but remains bounded by policy stability
   - Reasonable 90/10 range: approximately 15-20 basis points wide

3. **Distribution Shape**: Should be roughly symmetric around the median, with slightly fatter tails to account for unexpected liquidity events

4. **Bounds Check**: 
   - Lower bound provided: 3.112254%
   - Upper bound provided: 4.224105%
   - My prediction should stay well within these bounds given the stable environment
   - 10th percentile around 3.55% (10bp below current)
   - 90th percentile around 3.73% (8bp above current)

5. **Upset Rate**: In stable monetary policy periods, major upsets (>20bp moves) in overnight rates occur less than 5% of the time over 7-day windows. However, I should maintain reasonable tail width.
