Source analysis (key facts vs. opinions, date, quality)

1. FOMC statement (28 Jan 2026, federalreserve.gov)  
   • Fact: target fed-funds range held at 3.50 – 3.75 percent.  
   • High-quality, primary source. No opinions used.

2. FRED AMERIBOR series page (captured 04 Feb 2026, fred.stlouisfed.org)  
   • Fact: latest overnight AMERIBOR print 3.65076 percent on 2026-02-04; daily updates confirmed.  
   • High quality, direct data.

3. FRED AMERIBOR Term-30 series (data through 04 Feb 2026)  
   • Fact: 3.74 – 3.75 percent.  
   • High quality. Used only as a forward-looking cross-check.

4. H.15 Selected Interest Rates (03 Feb 2026, Federal Reserve)  
   • Fact: effective fed-funds rate 3.64 percent, stable for weeks.  
   • High quality.

5. American Banker (Jan 2025) & Chatham swap article (2024)  
   • Historical background on AMERIBOR; no short-run rate insight.  
   • Quality acceptable but only weak relevance.

6. Global rate-change news (Bank of England, RBI, Euribor, etc.)  
   • Facts about other jurisdictions; negligible causal link to U.S. overnight funding.  
   • Treated as weak evidence.

Evidence weighting

• Strong: 1, 2, 4 (direct, independent, recent).  
• Moderate: 3 (indirect market expectation).  
• Weak: 5-6 (background or foreign).

Timeframe analysis

• Forecast horizon: 7 calendar days (≈5 business days).  
• If horizon were halved, variance falls ~√½ → about 30 % tighter.  
• If doubled to two weeks, add month-end risk (Feb 28) so tails widen ~40 %.

Justification & inside-view adjustments

Baseline (outside view)  
• Overnight AMERIBOR follows EFFR plus a credit spread of roughly 3–5 bp.  
• EFFR has been pinned near 3.64 % since Sep 2025 whenever the FOMC is on hold.  
• Day-to-day AMERIBOR volatility in non-quarter-end weeks averages ±4 bp (80 % band).

Inside-view tweaks  
1. Mild downward drift observed (3.673 % on 29 Jan → 3.651 % on 4 Feb). Extend linear drift five trading days ≈ −0.01 % ⇒ center 3.64 %. (Moderate evidence)  
2. No scheduled FOMC, Treasury settlements, or quarter-end through 12 Feb. Reduces risk of large liquidity spikes. (Strong)  
3. Term-30 sitting ~9 bp above spot implies market not pricing either a sharp drop or pop; keeps tails reasonably symmetric. (Moderate)  
4. Residual probability of idiosyncratic funding tension (reg-change, cyber, bank-specific). Historically once a year we see a 15–25 bp one-day jump; assign ~5 % weight. (Weak-to-moderate)

Net result  
• Median anchored at 3.66 %.  
• σ (daily) ≈ 0.02 %; five-day σ ≈ 0.05 %.  
• Add fat-tail premium → widen 90/10 band to ±0.11 %.

Forecasting checklist

1. Target: Overnight Unsecured AMERIBOR rate (%) fixing for 12 Feb 2026.  
2. Base rate: current 3.65 %.  
3. Consistency: median 3.66; mean ~3.66; aligns with rationale.  
4. Top evidence:  
   • EFFR locked at 3.64 %.  
   • Latest AMERIBOR 3.651 % (04 Feb).  
   • No FOMC until March; liquidity calendar benign.  
   • Term-30 at 3.74 % suggests stability.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden counter-party risk scare (e.g., midsize-bank headlines) would push AMERIBOR > 3.85 %.
