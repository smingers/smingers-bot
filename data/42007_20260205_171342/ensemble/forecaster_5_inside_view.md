Forecast for: “Overnight Unsecured AMERIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate” fixing for Thursday 2026-02-12 (percent, three decimals).

========================
1. Source analysis (chronological & factual highlights)  
• FRED AMERIBOR series (daily to 2026-02-04): last seven prints 3.673 → 3.651; day-to-day σ ≈ 0.008.  Highest-quality, purely factual.  
• Federal Reserve FOMC statement (2026-01-28): target range kept at 3.50-3.75 %.  Reliable policy anchor.  
• FRED Term-30 AMERIBOR (through 2026-02-04): 3.74 %.  Market-implied one-month expectation.  Mechanical source.  
• Asknews/other articles (BoE, Euribor, India, Brazil): background on global rates; no direct causal link—classified as weak evidence for the next-week U.S. overnight rate.  
• Chatham swap article (2025) & other historical items: context only, no near-term rate information.

Factual content retained; opinions ignored unless from central-bank or AFX sources.

========================
2. Evidence weighting  
Strong (large weight)  
• Actual overnight AMERIBOR prints and their standard deviation.  
• Current Fed target range (hard ceiling/floor on unsecured funding).  
Moderate  
• Term-30 AMERIBOR at 3.74 % (market expects status-quo or slight uptick).  
• Typical AMERIBOR-EFFR spread (+1 bp).  
Weak  
• Pre-holiday liquidity patterns, global rate moves, anecdotal funding stories.

========================
3. Timeframe analysis  
Horizon = 7 calendar / 5 trading days.  
Historical σ_one-week ≈ 0.022 % (√5 × 0.01 %).  I inflate 50 % for tail risk ⇒ σ_adj ≈ 0.033 %.  
If horizon were halved, σ shrinks ≈ 25 %; doubled, widens ≈ 40 %.

========================
4. Outside-view base rate  
Twenty-day mean 3.664 %.  Baseline distribution centre 3.66 %.

========================
5. Inside-view adjustments  
• Mild downward drift since 2026-01-29 (−0.3 bp/day) pushes mean toward 3.65 %.  
• Treasury coupon settlements 14-Feb and long U.S. weekend (17-Feb holiday) usually add ½–1 bp.  
Net effect ≈ 0 bp relative to base.  Set median 3.655 %.

========================
6. Checklist  
1. Target variable: single overnight fixing, percent, 2026-02-12 – confirmed.  
2. Outside view mean 3.664 %.  Final median 3.655 % ≈ base.  
3. Consistency: median = 3.655; mean ≈ 3.655; matches justification.  
4. Key facts:  
   a) Fed target unchanged (3.50-3.75).  
   b) Last print 3.651 with tiny volatility.  
   c) AMERIBOR tracks EFFR +1 bp.  
   d) Term-30 at 3.74 caps upside.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden bank-funding scare (e.g., idiosyncratic credit event) could spike rate above 3.75 %.
