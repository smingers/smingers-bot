# Summary of Article

**Note:** This article appears to be about AMERIBOR Term-30 (a 30-day forward-looking rate), not the overnight AMERIBOR rate that is the subject of the forecasting question. However, it may provide some contextual information about recent AMERIBOR trends.

## Key Facts and Data:

**AMERIBOR Term-30 Recent Values:**
- 2026-02-04: 3.74559%
- 2026-02-03: 3.74643%
- 2026-02-02: 3.73902%
- 2026-01-30: 3.74600%
- 2026-01-29: 3.73605%

## Methodology Information:

- **AMERIBOR Term-30 Index** is a forward-looking interest rate designed to capture wholesale funding costs for American financial institutions over a thirty-day period
- It is calculated using overnight AMERIBOR as well as a broad dataset of real-world primary issuances of wholesale commercial deposits and commercial paper of U.S.-domiciled financial institutions
- The underlying overnight AMERIBOR is based on overnight unsecured loans transacted on the American Financial Exchange (AFX)
- Units: Percent, Not Seasonally Adjusted
- Frequency: Daily

**Important caveat:** The values shown are for the Term-30 derivative rate, not the overnight AMERIBOR rate specified in the forecasting question, though the Term-30 rate is calculated using overnight AMERIBOR as an input.

# Summary of Article: "Index provider ICE buys AFX and its Ameribor rate"

**Source:** American Banker  
**Date:** January 08, 2025

## Key Facts:

1. **Acquisition Details:**
   - Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) acquired the American Financial Exchange (AFX), which operates the Ameribor interest rate
   - Terms of the deal were not disclosed
   - ICE stated the acquisition is not expected to materially impact its 2025 financial results or capital distribution plans

2. **AFX/Ameribor Background:**
   - AFX was founded in 2015 by futures markets pioneer Richard Sandor
   - Ameribor is based on a marketplace AFX developed for U.S. banks to borrow from each other
   - According to AFX's website, the rates reflect "actual overnight borrowing costs of America's banks"
   - AFX has more than 240 banks and nonbank members
   - The Ameribor rate reflects funding costs for more than 1,000 U.S. banks and financial institutions, representing a quarter of the country's banking sector assets

3. **Market Context:**
   - Ameribor has gained traction among regional and community banks
   - These banks have argued that SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) is better suited for megabanks than smaller institutions
   - SOFR rapidly became the new U.S. standard to replace LIBOR after LIBOR was phased out due to a rate-rigging scandal
   - Unlike SOFR, Ameribor is "credit-sensitive" (rises or falls depending on lending conditions)
   - Bloomberg's competing BSBY rate was shut down in November 2023

## Named Source Opinions:

- **Carsten Kengeter, CEO at 7 RIDGE (previous owner of AFX):** Called the acquisition an "extraordinary opportunity for AFX" to expand Ameribor's reach and expressed confidence that "ICE's leadership will amplify AFX's success"

- **Christopher Edmonds, President of ICE's fixed income and data services division:** Called AFX a "natural fit to ICE," noting that ICE already offers mortgage technology services to regional and community banks

# Summary of Article: "LIBOR: What Was the London Interbank Offered Rate, and How Was It Used?"

**Source:** Investopedia

## Key Facts and Information:

### What LIBOR Was:
- LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) was a benchmark interest rate for short-term loans between major global banks
- Operated from 1986 to the 2000s as a globally accepted key benchmark for the cost of borrowing between banks
- Was calculated and published daily by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)

### Phase-Out Timeline:
- **Completely phased out:** June 30, 2023, and then completely in 2024
- **Partial phase-out:** One-week and two-month USD LIBORs stopped publishing on Dec. 31, 2021
- **Replacement:** Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)

### How LIBOR Worked:
- Based on five currencies: U.S. dollar, euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc
- Served seven different maturities: overnight/spot next, one week, and one, two, three, six, and 12 months
- This resulted in 35 different LIBORs calculated and reported each business day
- Most commonly quoted rate was the three-month U.S. dollar rate
- Published around 11:55 a.m. London time by the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA)

### Calculation Methodology:
- ICE asked major global banks how much they would charge other banks for short-term loans
- Used a trimmed average (removed highest and lowest figures, then calculated average from remaining numbers)
- In April 2018, IBA introduced the "Waterfall Methodology" with three levels:
  1. Volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of eligible transactions
  2. Transaction-derived data submissions
  3. Expert judgment based on wholesale funding market rates

### Reason for Discontinuation:
- Subject to manipulation, scandal, and methodological critique
- Major banks allegedly colluded to manipulate LIBORs by submitting artificially low rates

### Alternatives Mentioned:
- SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) - the official replacement
- Other regional rates: EURIBOR (Europe), TIBOR (Japan), SHIBOR (China), MIBOR (India)

## Relevance to Forecasting Question:

This article provides background on LIBOR, which is **not** the same as AMERIBOR. However, it establishes context about benchmark interbank lending rates. The key distinction is that AMERIBOR is based on the American Financial Exchange and continues to operate, while LIBOR was phased out and replaced by SOFR in 2023. The article does not contain specific information about AMERIBOR or predictions for its future values.

<Agent_report>
Query: Download FRED series AMERIBOR last 180 days and summarize daily mean, median, st-dev, and relationship to EFFR
The original request boils down to four concrete tasks for the most-recent 180 calendar days:

1. Pull the daily “Overnight Unsecured AMERIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate” (FRED series ID AMERIBOR).
2. Pull the daily “Effective Federal Funds Rate” (FRED series ID EFFR).
3. Compute mean, median and sample standard deviation of each series over that window.
4. Quantify the relationship between the two series (the standard first pass is the Pearson daily-return correlation and/or the simple level spread).

What the new search results confirm

• Data location and freshness  
  – The canonical AMERIBOR page on FRED shows observations through 4 Feb 2026 (value = 3.65076 percent) [fred.stlouisfed.org, AMERIBOR page].  
  – While the EFFR series page did not surface directly in the new snippets, it is still available on FRED; secondary mirrors such as YCharts list the latest print as 3.64 percent for 3 Feb 2026, implying FRED’s database has posted data at least that far [YCharts EFFR snapshot].

• Download mechanisms  
  – Every FRED series page features a “Download → CSV → Last 180 days” option that returns a two-column file (DATE, VALUE).  
  – For scripted workflows, the FRED API endpoint /fred/series/observations can be called with observation_start and observation_end parameters. The St. Louis Fed has migrated to API Version 2; an API key (free) is now required [Board of Governors notice on new FRED API, 4 Nov 2025].

• Calendar coverage  
  – Both series are published daily but with slight lags: EFFR is released one U.S. business day after the effective date; AMERIBOR is generally same-day mid-afternoon. Using a window that ends “yesterday” avoids nulls.

• Conceptual relationship  
  – AMERIBOR is a credit-sensitive, unsecured inter-bank rate; EFFR is the secured policy target. Industry commentary notes the two move closely together, with AMERIBOR typically a few basis points above EFFR during normal periods and diverging more in stress events (see discussion in Western Asset blog, 10 May 2021, and Traders Magazine white paper summary, 11 Sep 2024).

Concrete procedure to satisfy the request

1. Determine the 180-day window.  
   If today is 5 Feb 2026, set start = 10 Aug 2025 and end = 4 Feb 2026 (leaving one-day buffer for the EFFR lag).

2. Retrieve the data.  Two equivalent paths:  

   Manual (no coding):  
     • Navigate to https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/AMERIBOR → Download → CSV → Last 180 days; save as AMERIBOR_180d.csv.  
     • Navigate to https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EFFR → Download → CSV → Last 180 days; save as EFFR_180d.csv.

   Scripted (Python, R, etc.):  
     • Call  
       https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=AMERIBOR&observation_start=2025-08-10&observation_end=2026-02-04&api_key=YOURKEY&file_type=json  
       and the analogous call for EFFR.  
     • Parse the JSON into a data-frame.

3. Align the series on a common calendar (drop days missing in either series).

   Example in Python/pandas:

   ```python
   import pandas as pd
   ameribor = pd.read_csv('AMERIBOR_180d.csv', parse_dates=['DATE']).set_index('DATE')
   effr     = pd.read_csv('EFFR_180d.csv'    , parse_dates=['DATE']).set_index('DATE')

   df = ameribor.join(effr, lsuffix='_ameribor', rsuffix='_effr').dropna()
   ```

4. Compute descriptive statistics.

   ```python
   stats = df.agg(['mean', 'median', 'std']).T        # std() = sample st-dev
   ```

   The resulting table will list mean, median and σ for each rate.

5. Measure the relationship.

   ```python
   corr   = df['VALUE_ameribor'].corr(df['VALUE_effr'])      # Pearson r
   df['spread'] = df['VALUE_ameribor'] - df['VALUE_effr']
   avg_spread = df['spread'].mean()
   ```

   Reporting both the correlation coefficient and the average spread (in basis points) provides a clear picture of co-movement and relative level.

Deliverables to hand back to the stakeholder

• Two CSV files containing the raw 180-day histories.  
• A short table such as:

```
Series      Mean (%)   Median (%)   Std-dev (bp)
AMERIBOR      x.xxx       x.xxx        xx.x
EFFR          x.xxx       x.xxx        xx.x
```

• Relationship metrics:  Pearson r = 0.xxxx, average AMERIBOR–EFFR spread = y.y bp.

(Values x.xxx, y.y are placeholders until the code is run.)

Remaining information gaps

1. Numeric results.  The search results do not include the row-by-row observations, so the statistics cannot be filled in here; one must execute the download and calculation locally.  
2. Exact EFFR end-date.  FRED usually posts yesterday’s figure at 9:00 a.m. ET; if an observation is missing for the intended end-date, either shorten the window by a day or rerun the code after the release time.  
3. Choice of relationship metric.  If the user needs something beyond simple correlation/spread—e.g., regression beta, vector autoregression, or stress-period correlations—additional econometric work will be required.

Assessment

All critical source data are publicly accessible on FRED and can be exported in a few clicks or a single API call; the methodology to compute the requested statistics is straightforward. No additional web searching is required unless the user decides they need pre-written code libraries or academic papers discussing AMERIBOR–EFFR dynamics. As things stand, executing the five-step workflow above will fully satisfy the original query.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
