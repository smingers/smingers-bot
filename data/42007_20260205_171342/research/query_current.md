Analysis:
The overnight unsecured AMERIBOR rate normally tracks very closely (within a few basis-points spread) the effective federal funds rate and therefore moves primarily when the Fed changes its target range or when quarter-/month-end balance-sheet pressures surface.  Since the FOMC left its target range unchanged at its 28-29 Jan 2026 meeting and the next decision is not until 18 Mar 2026, policy-driven moves should be minimal between now and the 12 Feb observation date.  The last published AMERIBOR print on FRED (29 Jan 2026) was 3.67332 %.  To refine a forecast we therefore need:  
• Daily AMERIBOR fixes from 30 Jan through at least 4 Feb to see the immediate post-FOMC drift.  
• Press or analyst commentary on short-term funding conditions (e.g., Treasury settlement dates, T-bill supply, reserve balance changes) that could push the rate temporarily higher or lower.  
• Any news on banking system liquidity (e.g., usage of the Bank Term Funding Program successor, RRP take-up) that might affect unsecured borrowing costs.  
Recent articles from financial wires or AFX releases should give the freshest daily prints and any qualitative colour on funding-market tone needed for an inside view of where AMERIBOR is likely to be on 12 Feb 2026.
