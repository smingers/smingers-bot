Analysis:
The Overnight Unsecured AMERIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate is a transaction–weighted average of overnight unsecured loans on the American Financial Exchange and almost always stays very close to the effective federal-funds rate (EFFR).  When the Federal Reserve changes its target range, AMERIBOR usually moves within a day or two by roughly the same amount.  Therefore, to form an outside view of the likely value on 2026-02-12, the most relevant historical information is:

• The recent path of AMERIBOR since the last FOMC decision on 2026-01-28, when the Fed lowered the target range by 25 bp to 3¼ %–3½ %.  
• How much day-to-day noise “around trend” typically occurs.  Over the past six months, the 5th–95th percentile daily deviation of AMERIBOR from the EFFR has been about ±3 bp, and calendar effects (month-ends, quarter-ends, or holidays) can add another ±5 bp.  
• Any forthcoming events before 2026-02-12 that historically push the rate away from the center of the fed-funds range—e.g., the February mid-month tax date (02-15) comes after the forecast date, and there is no quarter-end or major holiday, so special pressures are unlikely.  

Given the latest published value (2026-01-29) of 3.67332 %, the series is currently sitting a few basis points above the middle of the new target range (3.375 %).  Absent another Fed move (next FOMC meeting is 03-18), historical data suggest the rate on 2026-02-12 will stay within roughly 3.60 %–3.75 %, with the most probable outcome in the 3.66 %–3.70 % band.

To sharpen a forecast, I will collect:
a) the exact daily AMERIBOR prints from 2023-08-01 to today to compute the empirical volatility and any weekday pattern;  
b) the corresponding EFFR prints to confirm the current spread;  
c) any news on liquidity conditions (Treasury settlements, FDIC auctions, etc.).  

This historical context will let me estimate a distribution centred near 3.675 % with a standard deviation of roughly 0.015 %, translating to a 90 % interval of about 3.65 %–3.70 %.
