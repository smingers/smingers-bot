Although market analysts had expected a 7-2 vote for holding rates steady, the higher number of dovish votes signaled a more accommodative stance than anticipated. This decision comes after six consecutive rate cuts since August 2024, bringing the rate to its lowest level in 2 years and 10 months. BOE Governor Andrew Bailey stated that while inflation remains above the 2% target\u2014measuring 3.4% in December 2025\u2014there is a 'possibility' of further rate cuts this year if economic conditions align. The BOE also projected 2026 GDP growth at 0.9%, down from 1.2% in November 2025, and 2027 growth at 1.5%, revised from 1.6%. Market expectations have since risen, with financial futures pricing in a 0.50 percentage point cut by year-end, exceeding prior expectations of a 0.35 percentage point reduction.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 12:38 PM\nSource:[\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20260205192451085)\n\n**India bonds rally may taper ahead of RBI debt purchase, rate decision**\nIndian government bond investors are targeting a break above the 6.70% yield level on the 10-year benchmark bond on Thursday, February 5, 2026, ahead of the Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) scheduled 500 billion rupee ($5.53 billion) bond purchase and the upcoming monetary policy decision on Friday. The benchmark 6.48% 2035 bond yield is expected to trade between 6.67% and 6.72%, having ended Wednesday at 6.6972%, a seven basis point decline over two sessions. Market participants anticipate further liquidity support, driving short-covering and new long positions. The RBI\u2019s final open market operation (OMO) of the fiscal year will include liquid 6.33% 2035 paper, with the cutoff rate signaling potential market direction. This purchase brings the RBI\u2019s total bond acquisitions to a record 6.7 trillion rupees. Although a rate change is unlikely, investors are seeking positive guidance and continued liquidity measures, including potential future OMOs. Nuvama notes that a 'wait-and-watch' tone with no rate cut hints could be interpreted as hawkish, pushing yields higher, while continued OMOs may support the bond market.

On February 4, 2026, the Euribor stood at 2.234% (+0.009), with the monthly average for February at 2.226% (-0.019). The annual average for 2025 was 2.222%, a decrease of 1.053 percentage points from the 2024 average of 3.275%. In January 2026, the average Euribor was 2.245%, a drop of 0.022 points from December 2025 and a significant decline from January 2025\u2019s 2.525%. This downward trend marks a slight relief for homeowners with variable-rate mortgages, ending a period of consecutive increases. The European Central Bank (ECB) has stabilized official interest rates around 2%, leading investors to expect minimal short-term volatility in the Euribor, though future cuts remain uncertain and depend on macroeconomic data and global economic conditions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 02:47 PM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/economia/20260204/precio-euribor-hoy-4-febrero-dv-126427171)\n\n**Indian bonds rise ahead of RBI debt purchase, policy outcome**\nIndian government bonds rose for a second consecutive session on February 4, 2026, driven by expectations of continued Reserve Bank of India (RBI) bond purchases ahead of record fiscal year 2027 (FY27) borrowing. The benchmark 10-year yield declined to 6.6972%, down 5 basis points from Tuesday\u2019s 6.7245%, after spiking to a one-year high earlier in the week. The RBI is scheduled to purchase 500 billion rupees ($5.53 billion) worth of bonds on Thursday, including the 6.33% 2035 paper, a move expected to signal the central bank\u2019s comfort with current yield levels. Markets anticipate the RBI will hold interest rates steady at its upcoming monetary policy decision on Friday, but are closely watching commentary on banking system liquidity. Vikas Garg, head of fixed income at Invesco Mutual Fund, stated that while no further rate cuts are expected, the RBI is likely to maintain a growth-supportive stance through ongoing open market operations (OMOs). The government plans to borrow a record 17.2 trillion rupees in FY27, prompting the Economic Affairs Secretary to confirm the use of instruments like bond switches to prevent market disruption and yield spikes. Overnight index swap (OIS) rates ended marginally lower: one-year OIS at 5.51%, two-year at 5.64%, and five-year at 6.08%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 12:43 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/indian-bonds-rise-ahead-of-central-bank-debt-purchase-policy-outcome/articleshow/127909186.cms)\n\n**Euro area bank interest rate statistics: December 2025**\nIn December 2025, the composite cost-of-borrowing indicator for euro area corporations increased, driven by rises in interest rates on new loans. The rate on new loans over \u20ac1 million with a floating rate and an initial fixation period of up to three months rose by 16 basis points to 3.31%. For loans with an initial fixation period of over three months and up to one year, the rate increased by 23 basis points to 3.57%. Loans with an initial fixation period of over ten years saw a 16 basis point increase to 3.65%. The rate on smaller loans (up to \u20ac250,000) with a floating rate and up to three months' fixation remained nearly unchanged at 3.65%. On the deposit side, the rate on corporate deposits with maturity up to one year stayed constant at 1.93%, and overnight corporate deposits remained at 0.52%. For sole proprietors and unincorporated partnerships, the interest rate on new loans with a floating rate and up to one year\u2019s fixation decreased by 19 basis points to 3.81%. The composite cost-of-borrowing indicator for households purchasing homes remained broadly unchanged. Rates on housing loans with floating rates and up to one year\u2019s fixation stayed at 3.55%, those with up to five years\u2019 fixation at 3.37%, over five to ten years at 3.48%, and over ten years at 3.13%. The rate on consumer loans to households decreased by 18 basis points to 7.15%. Household deposit rates also remained stable: up to one year\u2019s maturity at 1.77%, redeemable at three months\u2019 notice at 1.22%, and overnight deposits at 0.25%.

The DI for January 2028 fell to 12.655%, a decrease of 6 basis points from the previous day's 12.718%, while the DI for January 2035 dropped to 13.355% from 13.417%. The Copom minutes emphasized that the magnitude and duration of the rate-cut cycle will be determined over time as new data is incorporated, citing mixed signals on economic activity and inflation. The Central Bank reaffirmed its commitment to the 3% inflation target, noting that current inflation and market expectations are closer to the target. The market had already priced in a 50% chance of a 50-basis-point cut in March, 34% for a 25-point cut, and 7% for a 75-point cut. Minister of Finance Fernando Haddad\u2019s remarks, indicating that President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva had not yet appointed new Central Bank directors\u2014naming economists Guilherme Mello and Tiago Cavalcanti as potential candidates\u2014fueled the market\u2019s positive reaction. Mello, a heterodox economist from PUC-SP and Unicamp, raised concerns among investors due to fears of a dovish shift in monetary policy, though analyst Matheus Spiess noted that credible rate cuts require a Central Bank that can also raise rates when needed. Cavalcanti, a Cambridge and FGV-affiliated economist, was also suggested for the role. The market\u2019s decline in DI rates was further supported by a strong rise in the Ibovespa and a fall in the U.S. dollar, despite a midday uptick in U.S. Treasury yields driven by concerns over a partial U.S. government shutdown. By 16:35, the 10-year U.S. Treasury yield had fallen 1 basis point to 4.268%.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 07:50 PM\nSource:[InfoMoney](https://www.infomoney.com.br/mercados/taxas-dos-dis-caem-apos-ata-do-copom-reforcar-expectativa-de-corte-da-selic-em-marco/)\n\n**Eur\u00edbor Today, February 3: Correction in the Mortgage Market**\nThe eur\u00edbor, a benchmark interest rate reflecting the cost at which major European banks lend to one another in the interbank market, is updated daily and serves as a reference for various financial products, including mortgages, business loans, and investment instruments. On February 3, 2026, the eur\u00edbor stood at 2.225% (+0.007), with the monthly average for February at 2.221% (-0.024).

The 10-year benchmark yield fell 4 basis points to 6.7245%, down from 6.7662% the previous day\u2014the highest level in over a year. Traders took profits amid a supply-heavy market, limiting gains. The rupee strengthened 1.36% to 90.2650 per dollar, its best performance in seven years, while equities surged more than 2.5%\u2014the strongest session in nine months. The trade deal bolstered expectations of foreign inflows and reinforced the view that the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) is nearing the end of its easing cycle. MUFG Bank stated it expects the RBI to hold rates at 5.25% through its forecast horizon and sees the 10-year yield approaching 7% by the fourth quarter. The RBI has cut rates by 125 basis points since February 2025, and market participants increasingly believe the easing phase is concluding. The central bank\u2019s policy decision is scheduled for Friday. Overnight index swap (OIS) rates declined, with the one-year rate falling 2 bps to 5.52%, the two-year rate dropping 5.25 bps to 5.67%, and the five-year rate falling 7.5 bps to 6.1225%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 01:25 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/india-bond-rally-on-us-trade-pact-runs-into-supply-wall-rbi-meet/articleshow/127886436.cms)\n\n**Euribor on February 3, 2026: Daily Rate Falls to 2.226%**\nOn Tuesday, February 3, 2026, the daily Euribor rate decreased by 0.008 percentage points to 2.226%, marking a further decline from the previous day. The monthly average for February stood at 2.218%, a reduction of 0.189 percentage points compared to the prior day. The Euribor, short for Euro Interbank Offered Rate, represents the average interest rate at which major European banks lend to one another for a 12-month period. It is calculated daily based on estimates from leading financial institutions and serves as a key benchmark for variable-rate loans, particularly mortgages in Spain. The Euribor is published across multiple maturities\u20141 week, 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and 12 months\u2014and directly affects mortgage payments: when the Euribor falls, monthly payments typically decrease, and when it rises, payments increase. Since its introduction on January 1, 2000, the 12-month Euribor has become the primary reference index for variable-rate mortgages in Spain. The daily rate is published from Monday to Friday at 11:00 a.m. and officially announced in the Bolet\u00edn Oficial del Estado (BOE).\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 10:28 AM\nSource:[Expansi\u00f3n](https://www.expansion.com/mercados/euribor/2026/02/03/6981cdcd468aeb96508b4593.html)\n\n**India bond yields, OIS rates to fall as nation secures trade deal with US**\nIndia's bond yields and overnight index swap (OIS) rates are expected to decline following a trade truce between India and the United States, announced by U.S. President Donald Trump. The agreement reduces tariffs on Indian goods from 50% to 18%, the highest in Asia, easing trade tensions and boosting market sentiment. As a result, the benchmark 10-year 6.48% 2035 bond yield is projected to open between 6.70% and 6.72%, hovering in the 6.67%\u20136.73% range, down from Monday\u2019s close of 6.7662%, its highest level in over a year. Bond yields move inversely to prices, so this drop indicates rising demand. A private bank trader described the development as a 'major positive surprise,' noting that the timing was ideal after weeks of negative market sentiment. The rupee is expected to strengthen, reversing its record low of nearly 92 per dollar, which occurred the previous week. This recovery is expected to attract foreign capital after record equity outflows in 2025. The government is set to borrow a record 17.2 trillion rupees ($187.38 billion) in 2026\u201327, exceeding most market estimates. DBS Bank anticipates a relief rally in domestic markets, driven by reduced fiscal pressure and improved investor confidence. OIS rates are expected to fall, with the one-year rate dropping 1 bp to 5.5450% on Monday and the five-year rate rising 3.25 bps to 6.1950%, reflecting shifting expectations around monetary policy and liquidity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 03:07 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/india-bond-yields-ois-rates-to-fall-as-nation-secures-trade-deal-with-us/articleshow/127874407.cms)\n\n**Euribor Today, February 2, 2026: A Favorable Start for Mortgage Holders**\nThe Euribor index, a key benchmark in the European financial market, is calculated daily based on the interest rates at which the 18 largest banks in the Eurozone are willing to lend to one another. As of February 2, 2026, the Euribor rate stands at 2.218% (-0.008), with the monthly average for February at 2.245% (-0.027).

For mortgage holders, this decline has brought noticeable relief: the difference between the current monthly average and the same month in 2025 is 0.189 percentage points. While the Euribor began 2025 with a slight increase, reaching 2.525% by the end of January\u2014up from 2.436% in December\u2014this trend has since stabilized.

This shift aims to enhance transparency, reliability, and alignment with international standards in the money and foreign exchange markets. Unlike Jibor, which relies on quotations from 17 contributing banks, the new benchmark will be derived from all real transactions in the overnight interbank money market.

This follows previous cuts on September 18 and October 30, both in response to Federal Reserve rate reductions. The HKMA stated that the base interest rate serves as the foundation for calculating discount rates in repo transactions via the discount window. The rate is determined by taking the higher of two values: (1) the lower bound of the current U.S. federal funds rate target range plus 50 basis points, or (2) the five-day moving average of overnight and one-month Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBOR). On December 10 (U.S. time), the U.S. reduced its federal funds rate target range by 25 basis points, resulting in a value of 4.00% for the first component. The second component was calculated at 2.39%.

This represents a 0.030 percentage point rise compared to October, though it remains 0.288 percentage points below the level recorded in November 2024 (2.506%). For a homeowner with a 150,000 euro variable-rate mortgage over 30 years and a differential of 0.99% above Euribor, a revision based on the November level results in a monthly payment reduction of 23 euros\u2014equivalent to 286.5 euros annually. However, for those with semi-annual revisions, the monthly rate may rise by approximately 11.2 euros, or 67.1 euros per semester. Experts from Roams, iAhorro, Rastreator, HelpMyCash, and Kelisto analyze the trend: while the Euribor is stabilizing within a narrow range, reducing volatility and increasing predictability for variable-rate mortgage holders, uncertainty persists. iAhorro describes the rise as a 'bad news' event generating market uncertainty, citing the European Central Bank's (ECB) stagnation of official interest rates at 2% and banks' potential upward adjustments to mortgage rates, which have previously been below Euribor levels. Rastreator\u2019s Sergio Carbajal anticipates the Euribor will likely close 2025 between 2.20% and 2.25%, offering a sense of stability. HelpMyCash views the trend as part of a normalization process, not a sharp reversal, and expects the Euribor to remain within a stable band through mid-2026. Kelisto\u2019s Estefan\u00eda Gonz\u00e1lez notes the market is in a pause\u2014neither strong data justifying new hikes nor clear signals for a downward shift\u2014awaiting clearer ECB policy direction. Additionally, the Mibor (the interbank rate for one-year loans used before January 1, 2000) also closed November at 2.217%. The short-term Euribor rates for one week, one month, three months, and six months stood at 1.914%, 1.906%, 2.042%, and 2.131%, respectively. The euroSTR (the ECB\u2019s benchmark for overnight interest rates) ranged from 1.926% (one week) to 2.313% (one year).\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 01:34 PM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/economia/finanzas-00340/noticia-banco-espana-confirma-euribor-situo-2217-noviembre-20251201143436.html)\n\n**HKMA Adjusts Base Interest Rate to 4.25% with Immediate Effect**\nThe Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) announced on October 30, 2025, that the Hong Kong base interest rate has been adjusted to 4.25%, effective immediately. The base interest rate serves as the benchmark for discount rates applied in repurchase transactions through the discount window. It is determined by the higher of two values: the lower bound of the current U.S. federal funds rate target range plus 50 basis points, or the five-day moving average of overnight and one-month Hong Kong interbank offered rates (HIBOR). Due to a 25-basis-point reduction in the U.S. federal funds rate target range, the lower bound plus 50 basis points equals 4.25%, while the five-day moving average of HIBOR is 3.21%. Therefore, according to the pre-established formula, the base interest rate is set at 4.25%.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 02:03 AM\nSource:[\u661f\u5c9b\u73af\u7403\u7f51](https://www.stnn.cc/c/2025-10-30/4011849.shtml)\n\n**India introduces SORR to replace Mibor, strengthening benchmark for borrowing and derivatives**\nIndia is phasing in the Secured Overnight Rupee Rate (SORR) to replace the Mumbai Interbank Outright Rate (Mibor) as the benchmark for borrowing and derivatives, mirroring the global Libor transition.  Mibor, which underpins almost $1\u202ftrillion in interest\u2011rate swaps, is based on a tiny 2\u202f% slice of the funding market and has become increasingly volatile \u2013 it spiked more than 1\u202f% above the RBI\u2019s benchmark in March when liquidity dried up.  SORR, launched on 7\u202fJuly, is built on the overnight repo market, which today sees about $70\u202fbillion of secured trades daily, and is roughly 10 basis points lower than Mibor on average.  The shift is expected to give a more representative gauge of borrowing costs as the market moves away from unsecured interbank lending.  \"Since the secured markets have participation from even non\u2011bank players, SORR is likely to reflect the liquidity position of the broader financial system,\" said Samiran Chakraborty, Citigroup\u2019s managing director and chief India economist.  RBI officials note that the transition will depend on sufficient liquidity in the SORR swap market; meanwhile, the unsecured market will still serve as a gauge of lender risk.  \"Liquidity has moved beyond the banking sector \u2013 we now have mutual funds competing with bank deposits,\" added R. Gurumurthy, a former RBI regional director.  Ashhish Vaidya, head of treasury at DBS Bank India, warned that Mibor\u2019s volatility \"finally feeds into uncertainty for hedging costs.\"  The move is expected to attract greater foreign participation; Mibor\u2011linked swaps averaged $14\u202fbillion per day in the year to March\u202f2024, more than double the level five years earlier.  The transition will be gradual, with challenges similar to the Libor switch, including legacy contract renegotiation and potential transition risk for market participants.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 30, 2025 02:35 AM\nSource:[@businessline](https://www.thehindubusinessline.com/money-and-banking/sorr-set-to-become-indias-key-interest-rate-benchmark-replacing-mibor/article70111497.ece)\n\n**Eur\u00edbor Rate Today, September\u202f15: A Rough Start for Mortgage Borrowers**\nEur\u00edbor, the benchmark interest rate used across the Eurozone, closed January\u202f2025 at 2.525%, up from 2.436% in December\u202f2024, after a series of consecutive cuts. The rate is calculated from the overnight interbank rates of the 18 largest Eurozone banks. Compared with the same month last year, the current average monthly Eur\u00edbor is 0.764 percentage points higher. A year ago the index was above 3%. Despite the recent rise, mortgage borrowers have benefited from lower rates over the past year. Market expectations for further ECB cuts in 2025 remain divided, with some analysts forecasting another cut by year\u2011end depending on macroeconomic data.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 15, 2025 10:41 AM\nSource:[El Peri\u00f3dico](https://www.elperiodico.com/es/economia/20250915/precio-euribor-hoy-15-septiembre-dv-121568148)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
