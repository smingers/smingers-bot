This article is purely a release schedule and does not contain substantive information about actual AMERIBOR values, trends, or forecasts that would be directly useful for predicting the February 12, 2026 value.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/AMBOR30T\">\n# Summary of Article\n\n**Note:** This article appears to be about AMERIBOR Term-30 (a 30-day forward-looking rate), not the overnight AMERIBOR rate that is the subject of the forecasting question. However, it may provide some contextual information about recent AMERIBOR trends.\n\n## Key Facts and Data:\n\n**AMERIBOR Term-30 Recent Values:**\n- 2026-02-04: 3.74559%\n- 2026-02-03: 3.74643%\n- 2026-02-02: 3.73902%\n- 2026-01-30: 3.74600%\n- 2026-01-29: 3.73605%\n\n## Methodology Information:\n\n- **AMERIBOR Term-30 Index** is a forward-looking interest rate designed to capture wholesale funding costs for American financial institutions over a thirty-day period\n- It is calculated using overnight AMERIBOR as well as a broad dataset of real-world primary issuances of wholesale commercial deposits and commercial paper of U.S.-domiciled financial institutions\n- The underlying overnight AMERIBOR is based on overnight unsecured loans transacted on the American Financial Exchange (AFX)\n- Units: Percent, Not Seasonally Adjusted\n- Frequency: Daily\n\n**Important caveat:** The values shown are for the Term-30 derivative rate, not the overnight AMERIBOR rate specified in the forecasting question, though the Term-30 rate is calculated using overnight AMERIBOR as an input.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h15/\">\n# Summary of Federal Reserve H.15 Selected Interest Rates Article\n\n## Key Facts and Data Points:\n\n**Document Type:** Federal Reserve Board's H.15 Selected Interest Rates (Daily) report\n\n**Date Range Covered:** January 28, 2026 through February 3, 2026\n\n**Relevant Interest Rates (as of February 3, 2026):**\n- Federal funds (effective): 3.64%\n- Bank prime loan: 6.75%\n- Discount window primary credit: 3.75%\n- Commercial paper rates (nonfinancial): ranging from 3.62% to 3.64% for various maturities\n- Treasury bills (secondary market):\n  - 4-week: 3.63%\n  - 3-month: 3.60%\n  - 6-month: 3.53%\n  - 1-year: 3.36%\n- Treasury constant maturities (nominal):\n  - 1-month: 3.72%\n  - 3-month: 3.69%\n  - 10-year: 4.28%\n  - 30-year: 4.90%\n\n**Notable Context:**\n- The Federal Reserve's effective federal funds rate remained stable at 3.64% throughout the entire period shown (January 28 - February 3, 2026)\n- All rates shown are yields in percent per annum\n- The document notes a partnership between the Federal Reserve's Data Download Program (DDP) and FRED for accessing interactive charts\n\n**Note:** This article does not contain specific information about AMERIBOR rates. It provides context on the broader interest rate environment during late January and early February 2026, which may be relevant for understanding the interest rate landscape during the period leading up to the forecast date of February 12, 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.americanbanker.com/news/index-provider-ice-buys-afx-and-its-ameribor-rate\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Index provider ICE buys AFX and its Ameribor rate\"\n\n**Source:** American Banker  \n**Date:** January 08, 2025\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n1. **Acquisition Details:**\n   - Intercontinental Exchange (ICE) acquired the American Financial Exchange (AFX), which operates the Ameribor interest rate\n   - Terms of the deal were not disclosed\n   - ICE stated the acquisition is not expected to materially impact its 2025 financial results or capital distribution plans\n\n2. **AFX/Ameribor Background:**\n   - AFX was founded in 2015 by futures markets pioneer Richard Sandor\n   - Ameribor is based on a marketplace AFX developed for U.S. banks to borrow from each other\n   - According to AFX's website, the rates reflect \"actual overnight borrowing costs of America's banks\"\n   - AFX has more than 240 banks and nonbank members\n   - The Ameribor rate reflects funding costs for more than 1,000 U.S. banks and financial institutions, representing a quarter of the country's banking sector assets\n\n3. **Market Context:**\n   - Ameribor has gained traction among regional and community banks\n   - These banks have argued that SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) is better suited for megabanks than smaller institutions\n   - SOFR rapidly became the new U.S. standard to replace LIBOR after LIBOR was phased out due to a rate-rigging scandal\n   - Unlike SOFR, Ameribor is \"credit-sensitive\" (rises or falls depending on lending conditions)\n   - Bloomberg's competing BSBY rate was shut down in November 2023\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n- **Carsten Kengeter, CEO at 7 RIDGE (previous owner of AFX):** Called the acquisition an \"extraordinary opportunity for AFX\" to expand Ameribor's reach and expressed confidence that \"ICE's leadership will amplify AFX's success\"\n\n- **Christopher Edmonds, President of ICE's fixed income and data services division:** Called AFX a \"natural fit to ICE,\" noting that ICE already offers mortgage technology services to regional and community banks\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/l/libor.asp\">\n# Summary of Article: \"LIBOR: What Was the London Interbank Offered Rate, and How Was It Used?\"\n\n**Source:** Investopedia\n\n## Key Facts and Information:\n\n### What LIBOR Was:\n- LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate) was a benchmark interest rate for short-term loans between major global banks\n- Operated from 1986 to the 2000s as a globally accepted key benchmark for the cost of borrowing between banks\n- Was calculated and published daily by the Intercontinental Exchange (ICE)\n\n### Phase-Out Timeline:\n- **Completely phased out:** June 30, 2023, and then completely in 2024\n- **Partial phase-out:** One-week and two-month USD LIBORs stopped publishing on Dec. 31, 2021\n- **Replacement:** Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR)\n\n### How LIBOR Worked:\n- Based on five currencies: U.S. dollar, euro, British pound, Japanese yen, and Swiss franc\n- Served seven different maturities: overnight/spot next, one week, and one, two, three, six, and 12 months\n- This resulted in 35 different LIBORs calculated and reported each business day\n- Most commonly quoted rate was the three-month U.S. dollar rate\n- Published around 11:55 a.m. London time by the ICE Benchmark Administration (IBA)\n\n### Calculation Methodology:\n- ICE asked major global banks how much they would charge other banks for short-term loans\n- Used a trimmed average (removed highest and lowest figures, then calculated average from remaining numbers)\n- In April 2018, IBA introduced the \"Waterfall Methodology\" with three levels:\n  1. Volume-weighted average price (VWAP) of eligible transactions\n  2. Transaction-derived data submissions\n  3. Expert judgment based on wholesale funding market rates\n\n### Reason for Discontinuation:\n- Subject to manipulation, scandal, and methodological critique\n- Major banks allegedly colluded to manipulate LIBORs by submitting artificially low rates\n\n### Alternatives Mentioned:\n- SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) - the official replacement\n- Other regional rates: EURIBOR (Europe), TIBOR (Japan), SHIBOR (China), MIBOR (India)\n\n## Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\nThis article provides background on LIBOR, which is **not** the same as AMERIBOR. However, it establishes context about benchmark interbank lending rates. The key distinction is that AMERIBOR is based on the American Financial Exchange and continues to operate, while LIBOR was phased out and replaced by SOFR in 2023. The article does not contain specific information about AMERIBOR or predictions for its future values.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Download FRED series AMERIBOR last 180 days and summarize daily mean, median, st-dev, and relationship to EFFR\nThe original request boils down to four concrete tasks for the most-recent 180 calendar days:\n\n1. Pull the daily \u201cOvernight Unsecured AMERIBOR Benchmark Interest Rate\u201d (FRED series ID AMERIBOR).\n2. Pull the daily \u201cEffective Federal Funds Rate\u201d (FRED series ID EFFR).\n3. Compute mean, median and sample standard deviation of each series over that window.\n4. Quantify the relationship between the two series (the standard first pass is the Pearson daily-return correlation and/or the simple level spread).\n\nWhat the new search results confirm\n\n\u2022 Data location and freshness  \n  \u2013 The canonical AMERIBOR page on FRED shows observations through 4 Feb 2026 (value = 3.65076 percent) [fred.stlouisfed.org, AMERIBOR page].  \n  \u2013 While the EFFR series page did not surface directly in the new snippets, it is still available on FRED; secondary mirrors such as YCharts list the latest print as 3.64 percent for 3 Feb 2026, implying FRED\u2019s database has posted data at least that far [YCharts EFFR snapshot].\n\n\u2022 Download mechanisms  \n  \u2013 Every FRED series page features a \u201cDownload \u2192 CSV \u2192 Last 180 days\u201d option that returns a two-column file (DATE, VALUE).  \n  \u2013 For scripted workflows, the FRED API endpoint /fred/series/observations can be called with observation_start and observation_end parameters. The St. Louis Fed has migrated to API Version 2; an API key (free) is now required [Board of Governors notice on new FRED API, 4 Nov 2025].\n\n\u2022 Calendar coverage  \n  \u2013 Both series are published daily but with slight lags: EFFR is released one U.S. business day after the effective date; AMERIBOR is generally same-day mid-afternoon. Using a window that ends \u201cyesterday\u201d avoids nulls.\n\n\u2022 Conceptual relationship  \n  \u2013 AMERIBOR is a credit-sensitive, unsecured inter-bank rate; EFFR is the secured policy target. Industry commentary notes the two move closely together, with AMERIBOR typically a few basis points above EFFR during normal periods and diverging more in stress events (see discussion in Western Asset blog, 10 May 2021, and Traders Magazine white paper summary, 11 Sep 2024).\n\nConcrete procedure to satisfy the request\n\n1. Determine the 180-day window.  \n   If today is 5 Feb 2026, set start = 10 Aug 2025 and end = 4 Feb 2026 (leaving one-day buffer for the EFFR lag).\n\n2. Retrieve the data.  Two equivalent paths:  \n\n   Manual (no coding):  \n     \u2022 Navigate to https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/AMERIBOR \u2192 Download \u2192 CSV \u2192 Last 180 days; save as AMERIBOR_180d.csv.  \n     \u2022 Navigate to https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/EFFR \u2192 Download \u2192 CSV \u2192 Last 180 days; save as EFFR_180d.csv.\n\n   Scripted (Python, R, etc.):  \n     \u2022 Call  \n       https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=AMERIBOR&observation_start=2025-08-10&observation_end=2026-02-04&api_key=YOURKEY&file_type=json  \n       and the analogous call for EFFR.  \n     \u2022 Parse the JSON into a data-frame.\n\n3. Align the series on a common calendar (drop days missing in either series).\n\n   Example in Python/pandas:\n\n   ```python\n   import pandas as pd\n   ameribor = pd.read_csv('AMERIBOR_180d.csv', parse_dates=['DATE']).set_index('DATE')\n   effr     = pd.read_csv('EFFR_180d.csv'    , parse_dates=['DATE']).set_index('DATE')\n\n   df = ameribor.join(effr, lsuffix='_ameribor', rsuffix='_effr').dropna()\n   ```\n\n4. Compute descriptive statistics.\n\n   ```python\n   stats = df.agg(['mean', 'median', 'std']).T        # std() = sample st-dev\n   ```\n\n   The resulting table will list mean, median and \u03c3 for each rate.\n\n5. Measure the relationship.\n\n   ```python\n   corr   = df['VALUE_ameribor'].corr(df['VALUE_effr'])      # Pearson r\n   df['spread'] = df['VALUE_ameribor'] - df['VALUE_effr']\n   avg_spread = df['spread'].mean()\n   ```\n\n   Reporting both the correlation coefficient and the average spread (in basis points) provides a clear picture of co-movement and relative level.\n\nDeliverables to hand back to the stakeholder\n\n\u2022 Two CSV files containing the raw 180-day histories.  \n\u2022 A short table such as:\n\n```\nSeries      Mean (%)   Median (%)   Std-dev (bp)\nAMERIBOR      x.xxx       x.xxx        xx.x\nEFFR          x.xxx       x.xxx        xx.x\n```\n\n\u2022 Relationship metrics:  Pearson r = 0.xxxx, average AMERIBOR\u2013EFFR spread = y.y bp.\n\n(Values x.xxx, y.y are placeholders until the code is run.)\n\nRemaining information gaps\n\n1. Numeric results.  The search results do not include the row-by-row observations, so the statistics cannot be filled in here; one must execute the download and calculation locally.  \n2. Exact EFFR end-date.  FRED usually posts yesterday\u2019s figure at 9:00 a.m. ET; if an observation is missing for the intended end-date, either shorten the window by a day or rerun the code after the release time.  \n3. Choice of relationship metric.  If the user needs something beyond simple correlation/spread\u2014e.g., regression beta, vector autoregression, or stress-period correlations\u2014additional econometric work will be required.\n\nAssessment\n\nAll critical source data are publicly accessible on FRED and can be exported in a few clicks or a single API call; the methodology to compute the requested statistics is straightforward. No additional web searching is required unless the user decides they need pre-written code libraries or academic papers discussing AMERIBOR\u2013EFFR dynamics. As things stand, executing the five-step workflow above will fully satisfy the original query.</Agent_report>\n"
