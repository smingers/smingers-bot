## (a) Source analysis (quality, date, and what is fact vs opinion)

### Web summaries provided
1) **Tickernerd (HAL forecast)** (recent; secondary aggregation)  
- **Quality:** Medium. Mostly an **aggregator** of analyst ratings/targets and some company bullet points.  
- **Facts:** “Strong Buy” style consensus; median target around **$35**; lists firm-by-firm targets.  
- **Opinions:** The “strong buy” framing is interpretive; price targets are expert opinions but **not short-horizon** (typically 12-month).

2) **Stockscan (forecast + technicals)** (recent; model-driven site)  
- **Quality:** Medium-low to medium. “Forecast” is **model output** with unclear edge; technical indicator compilation is factual but not strongly predictive alone.  
- **Facts:** Technicals show many “buy” moving averages; RSI ~60 (neutral).  
- **Opinions/Modeling:** 30-day “average target” slightly **below** current price (bearish tilt). This is not an identifiable expert call—more like a derived estimate.

3) **Public.com (bull/bear narrative)** (recent; retail-facing synthesis)  
- **Quality:** Medium-low. Reads like a **pro/con explainer**.  
- **Facts:** Mentions expected FCF magnitude, revenue/EBITDA expectations.  
- **Opinions:** The framing (“bullish/bearish”) is editorial; useful mainly for mapping plausible narratives.

4) **Simplywall.st valuation check (Jan 22, 2026)**  
- **Quality:** Medium. DCF outputs can be highly assumption-sensitive.  
- **Facts:** Recent returns; P/E context.  
- **Opinions/Modeling:** “Heavily undervalued” vs DCF is **model-dependent**; not a near-term signal.

5) **MarketBeat earnings call highlights (Jan 21, 2026)**  
- **Quality:** Medium-high as a structured recap of management commentary/guidance.  
- **Facts:** Q4 results, segment/geography trends, and **Q1 2026 guidance** (notably sequential declines).  
- **Opinions:** Management outlook language (e.g., “rebalancing year”) is informed but still guidance/interpretation.

6) **Yahoo Finance (Dec 12, 2025) conference call announcement**  
- **Quality:** High but largely **non-informative** for direction now (event already occurred Jan 21).

### Asknews article set (critical filtering: many are NOT our HAL)
- Multiple articles titled about **“HAL share price plummets…”** are about **Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (India)**, *not* Halliburton. **Irrelevant** to NYSE:HAL and should be excluded.
- “Hal (HAL.AS)” is **HAL Trust (Amsterdam)**, not Halliburton. **Irrelevant**.
- “Halberd (HALB)” is a microcap, not Halliburton. **Irrelevant**.
- **Barchart.com (Feb 4, 2026) analyst estimates & ratings**:  
  - **Quality:** Medium. It compiles analyst consensus and recent performance; generally coherent.  
  - **Facts:** YTD outperformance; Q4 beat; consensus ratings/targets.  
  - **Opinions:** “Moderate Buy” and targets are expert opinions but long-horizon.
- **GuruFocus (Jan 21, 2026)** and **FactSet survey via Anue (Jan 21, 2026)**:  
  - **Quality:** Medium. Useful for **consensus targets and ratings**; again, not short-horizon.
- **Nasdaq/Zacks (Dec 22, 2025)**:  
  - **Quality:** Medium. The Zacks Rank is a systematic signal but not transparent enough to treat as strong.  
  - **Facts:** Estimate revisions; forward P/E comparisons.  
  - **Opinions:** Zacks rank implication is model-based.

Net: after removing ticker-confusions, the **relevant** evidence is mostly: (i) post-earnings positioning, (ii) guidance implying softer Q1 sequentially, (iii) consensus targets slightly above spot, (iv) technical/momentum mixed-to-positive.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

### Strong evidence
- **None** that cleanly determines an 8-day direction. No major HAL-specific catalyst scheduled inside the window (from provided context).

### Moderate evidence (pushes probability modestly)
1) **Recent momentum / trend** (Simplywall: +18% 30-day; Barchart: strong YTD):  
   - Mechanism: short-term momentum can persist over weeks.  
   - **Moderate bullish** for Feb 13 > Feb 5.

2) **Analyst consensus targets clustered slightly above current** (Tickernerd/Barchart/FactSet-style summaries):  
   - Mechanism: supportive sentiment/positioning, but targets are ~12-month.  
   - **Slight bullish** (weak-to-moderate for a 6-session horizon).

3) **Management guidance implies sequential softness in Q1 2026** (MarketBeat highlights):  
   - Mechanism: reinforces “2026 rebalancing” and near-term margin/revenue decline narrative.  
   - **Moderate bearish** (could cap near-term upside; encourages consolidation).

### Weak evidence (small nudges)
- **Technical indicator bundles** (Stockscan “Strong Buy” technicals): supportive but noisy. **Slight bullish**.
- **Valuation DCF “undervalued”** (Simplywall): too long-horizon. **Very weak bullish**.
- **Short-term model forecast slightly negative** (Stockscan 30-day average target below spot): unclear methodology edge. **Weak bearish**.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- Timeframe is **Feb 5 close → Feb 13 close** (~**6 trading days**).
- In such a short horizon, **macro prints** (e.g., CPI on/near Feb 13 per your outside-view notes) and oil-related weekly data can dominate day-to-day moves, but direction is still close to a coin flip.
- **If halved** (≈3 trading days): I’d move closer to **50/50** (less time for drift/momentum to manifest).
- **If doubled** (≈12 trading days): I’d lean a bit more toward fundamentals/sentiment and momentum, likely **slightly higher** than my 8-day probability (more time for trend continuation), unless oil macro turns risk-off.

## (d) Justification: moving from outside view (58%) to inside view
**Outside view base rate provided: 58%.** I treat that as a momentum-tilted coin flip.

**Inside-view adjustments:**
- **Downward adjustment (−3 to −5 pts):** Management’s **Q1 sequential decline guidance** and “rebalancing year / commodity prices unlikely to rise near term absent geopolitics” language is a plausible near-term ceiling on enthusiasm. In a short window after a strong run, this can produce **consolidation or small pullbacks** rather than continued climb.
- **Upward adjustment (+1 to +2 pts):** Technical posture and still-positive Street consensus (targets modestly above, ratings mostly Buy/Hold) reduce odds of a sharp unexplained dump over just ~6 sessions.

Net: about **−3 pts** from 58% feels appropriate.

So my inside-view probability is **~55%** that Feb 13 close > Feb 5 close.

Probability calibration:
- Outside view: **58%**
- Inside view shifts:
  - Q1 softness / “rebalancing” narrative: **−4%**
  - Supportive technicals + consensus not negative: **+1%**
- **Inside view forecast: 55%**

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: “Will NYSE:HAL’s **Feb 13, 2026** close be **above** its **Feb 5, 2026** close (Yahoo Finance closes)?”
2) Outside view base rate: **58% Yes**.
3) Consistency: “**55** out of 100 times, HAL closes higher on 2026-02-13 than on 2026-02-05.”
4) Key evidence:
   - Strong recent momentum/returns into early Feb (moderate bullish).
   - Management guides for sequential Q1 declines and frames 2026 as rebalancing (moderate bearish).
   - Consensus targets/ratings modestly supportive but long-horizon (slight bullish).
   - Many Asknews “HAL” articles are ticker-confusions (excluded).
5) Blind spot: A **large oil price move or CPI shock** in this short window could dominate and overwhelm stock-specific drift.
6) Status quo: In ~6 sessions, “small move either way” is typical → keep probability near 50, only modestly tilted up.

Probability: 55%
