Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)

1. Barchart.com 4-Feb-26 “Halliburton Company Stock: Analyst Estimates & Ratings”
   • Facts: YTD +19.9 %, Q4-25 beat, average 12-m PT $35.7, rating distribution.  
   • Opinion: Stifel analyst raises PT to $35 (mildly bullish).  
   • Quality: Reputable data aggregator, dated two days ago – good factual reliability, medium short-term relevance (12-month horizon).

2. Stockscan 3-Feb-26 forecast page  
   • Facts: Current price $33.67; 30-day avg PT $32.90 (-2.3 %); technical dashboard 11 Buy / 2 Sell signals.  
   • Opinion: “Overall negative next 30 days.”  
   • Quality: Model is opaque; useful as sentiment snapshot. Short-term PT lends some relevance.

3. Tickernerd 1-Feb-26 article  
   • Facts: Price $34.34; analyst median PT $35; Venezuela restart news.  
   • Opinion: “Strong Buy.”  
   • Quality: Mostly aggregated data; lightly promotional; limited incremental value.

4. SimplyWallSt 22-Jan-26 valuation note  
   • Facts: Q4 flat, FY profit down, P/E 21.9x.  
   • Opinion: DCF says “undervalued.”  
   • Quality: Automated model; distant from 8-day horizon.

5. MarketBeat short-interest/insider report 23-Jan-26 (in outside-view packet)  
   • Facts: Short interest +23 % m/m; insider sales $11 m.  
   • Opinion: “Moderate Buy.”  
   • Quality: Factual data sound; signals are weakly predictive over one week.

6. GuruFocus 21-Jan-26 price-move note  
   • Facts: PT consensus $32.55; rating 2.1 (Outperform).  
   • Quality: Factual but 12-m orientation.

No HAL-specific scheduled catalysts fall inside 6 trading-day window (earnings already passed).  Geopolitical / macro prints (EIA 7-Feb & 11-Feb, CPI 13-Feb) are sector-wide, directionally uncertain.

(b) Evidence weighting

• Weak-to-moderate upward evidence  
  – Technical dashboard “Strong Buy” (Stockscan): moderate.  
  – Recent upward momentum (HAL +20 % YTD versus S&P +1 %): weak (could invite mean-reversion).

• Weak-to-moderate downward evidence  
  – 30-day fundamental model implies -2 % drift: moderate.  
  – Short interest jump & insider selling: weak-moderate.  
  – Recent out-performance elevates chance of profit-taking: weak.

No strong evidence in either direction.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in 6 trading days (5 – 13 Feb 26).  If horizon were halved (3 days) randomness dominates → probability moves closer to 50 %.  If doubled (12 days) macro prints & oil trend gain weight; slight drift advantage would creep probability a point or two higher.

(d) Justification and adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (large-cap single stock, one-week horizon) ≈ 52 % that the close is higher.  
Adjustments:  
– Mean-reversion after strong run and mildly bearish 30-day forecast: −3 pp  
– Technical “buy” signals and ongoing buybacks: +2 pp  
– Higher short interest / insider selling: −1 pp  

Net inside-view probability ≈ 50 % (rounded 49 %).

Probability calibration
I estimate that 49 % of the time HAL’s 13-Feb-26 close will exceed its 5-Feb-26 close. Directional edge is essentially a coin-flip once small, offsetting signals are weighed.

Checklist:
1. Will HAL close higher on 13-Feb than on 5-Feb? 6-trading-day window.  
2. Base rate 52 %.  
3. “In 49 of 100 trials HAL ends higher after a week.” – consistent.  
4. Key evidence: a) 30-day model -2 % drift; b) technical dashboard “Strong Buy”; c) short interest +23 %; d) recent +20 % YTD rally.  
5. Blind spot: Sudden crude-oil spike on Mideast escalation lifts oil-services 10 % → would make my call too low.  
6. Status quo: Absent catalyst, drift tiny; probability pulled toward 50 %.

Probability: 49 %
