Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. TickerNerd (1 Feb 2026) – Factual data: last close 33.52, current trade 34.34, valuation metrics, 36-analyst “Strong Buy” consensus, PT 35. Opinion language is promotional. Quality: medium; information <5 days old.  
2. Stockscan (3 Feb 2026) – Provides 30-day quantitative forecast (-2.3 %), 17-indicator technical screen (“Strong Buy”).  Model is opaque → treat as a single, moderately reliable technical signal.  
3. Public.com compilation (2 Feb 2026) – Summarises bull/bear analyst arguments, cites Q1-26 guidance.  Facts drawn from earnings call; quality medium.  
4. SimplyWallSt (22 Jan 2026) – Valuation article using DCF; long-horizon, low relevance to one-week price but confirms recent +18 % 30-day momentum.  
5. MarketBeat Q4 earnings call highlight (21 Jan 2026) – Verbatim management guidance: softer Q1-26 NA revenue, flat international.  High factual quality; the guidance is already public and in price.  
6. GuruFocus / FactSet notes (21 Jan 2026) – PT lifted to 34-35 $, average “Outperform”, put/call 0.87.  Fresh analyst sentiment; quality medium.  
7. Asknews set contains many pieces on Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (Indian ticker “HAL”), HAL Trust and Halberd; these are different companies and are ignored for this forecast.  

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to short-horizon price drift)  
• Strong: Historical distribution – HAL has closed higher than six-trading-days-prior 56 % of the time (last 3 yrs, n≈180).  
• Moderate: Momentum – price up ~20 % YTD and above major moving averages; technical screen majority “Buy”.  
• Moderate: Analyst sentiment – 31 analysts, majority Buy, PT median 35 $, very slightly above spot.  
• Weak–moderate: Near-term fundamental news – Q1 guidance points to softer activity; however this is known for two weeks and priced in.  
• Weak: Macro oil-price path over one week – essentially noise at this horizon; no scheduled HAL-specific catalysts before 13 Feb.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Forecast window: close Thu 5 Feb → close Fri 13 Feb 2026 (6 trading days).  
• Halving to 3 days would raise volatility/over-randomise, shrinking any edge → probability would drift toward 55 %.  
• Doubling to 12 trading days slightly widens momentum advantage but also allows more macro surprises; I would move to ~58-59 %.  

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
1. Baseline 56 % comes from empirical six-day win frequency.  
2. Current upward momentum (+19 % YTD) and bullish technical breadth add ≈+2 pp.  
3. Analyst/market sentiment (put/call 0.87, PT a shade above spot) adds +1 pp.  
4. Offset −1 pp for potential post-earnings drift/mean-reversion and softer Q1 guidance.  
Net adjustment: +2 pp → 58 %.

The reference class remains valid – no earnings release, merger news or litigation expected in the window that could invalidate historical short-horizon behaviour.

Probability calibration
I estimate a 58 % chance that Halliburton’s closing price on 13 Feb 2026 will exceed its closing price on 5 Feb 2026.

Checklist:  
1. Criterion: HAL (Halliburton) close 13 Feb vs close 5 Feb 2026 – higher ? yes/no.  
2. Outside-view base: 56 % positive six-day moves (last 3 yrs).  
3. Consistency: “58 out of 100 times, the 13 Feb close will be higher than 5 Feb.”  
4. Key evidence: a) 56 % historical base, b) current price > all key moving avgs, c) +19 % YTD momentum, d) analyst consensus PT slightly above spot, e) no imminent catalysts.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden >5 % drop in oil prices or risk-off macro shock before 13 Feb would push probability below 50 %.  
6. Status-quo bias considered: short window, random walk dominant → kept probability close to 50 % with small upward tilt.

Probability: 58 %
