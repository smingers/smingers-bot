</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide HAL daily close prices for the past 365 trading days up to 2026-02-04, compute distribution of 8-day percentage moves, summarize mean, median, 25th and 75th percentiles; list any company events, macro or industry events (earnings releases, conference presentations, OPEC meetings, EIA reports) scheduled between 2026-02-05 and 2026-02-13 that historically impact oilfield services stocks.
The available search results let us firm-up most of the qualitative (calendar) portion of the original request, but they are still insufficient for the quantitative (price-series) work.

1. 365 trading-day close-price vector (5 Feb 2025 – 4 Feb 2026)
• Only a small slice of daily closes is presently available.  FinancialContent shows the most recent 45 trading days (2 Dec 2025 – 4 Feb 2026) with valid NYSE closes such as 34.34 on 4-Feb-2026 and 29.60 on 2-Jan-2026 (FinancialContent list).  
• Macrotrends confirms the 4-Feb-2026 close (34.34) and offers long-term annual averages but not the required daily granularity (Macrotrends page).
• Neither source provides the remaining ~320 trading days back to 5-Feb-2025.  The Stooq directory structure (Free Market Data page; MSSQLTips walk-through cited earlier) and the Alpha Vantage API documentation (Alpha Vantage) both indicate that a full, no-cost CSV can be downloaded, but the actual HAL time-series file has not yet been pulled.

Without the full close-price vector:
 • The 8-day percentage-move series (~357 observations) cannot be calculated.  
 • Consequently the mean, median, 25th and 75th percentile statistics that the user asked for remain outstanding.

2. Event calendar: 5 Feb 2026 – 13 Feb 2026
Items that historically move oil-service equities are now documented:

Company / industry conferences
• SPE Hydraulic Fracturing Technology Conference – final day 5-Feb-2026; Halliburton is an exhibitor (Halliburton event page).
• Kuwait Oil & Gas Show (KOGS) – final day 5-Feb-2026; Halliburton listed as exhibitor (carried forward from prior rounds).

Macro / commodity data releases
• Baker Hughes North-America rig count – weekly prints due Friday 6-Feb (already out) and Friday 13-Feb-2026 at 13:00 ET (Investing.com economic calendar; Pipe Exchange running table).
• EIA Weekly Petroleum Status Report – Wednesday 11-Feb-2026 (EIA calendar).
• U.S. Employment Situation (January 2026) – Friday 11-Feb-2026 (BLS calendar referenced earlier).
• U.S. CPI (January 2026) – Friday 13-Feb-2026 (Investing.com calendar).
• No OPEC+ ministerial or Monthly Oil Market Report falls in the window (current OPEC schedule checked previously).

Unresolved calendar item
• February-2026 IEA Oil Market Report: the exact publication day (usually mid-month) is still unverified.

Company-specific investor events
• Halliburton’s Q4-2025 earnings call took place 21-Jan-2026 (RTTNews), so no earnings or sell-side conference for HAL is scheduled within 5–13 Feb.

3. Remaining information gaps
Quantitative:
 • Full daily close series (5-Feb-2025 → 4-Feb-2026).
 • Computation of 8-day %-move distribution and its summary statistics.

Qualitative:
 • Confirm the exact release date of the IEA February-2026 Oil Market Report.
 • Quick refresh of Halliburton IR/event pages to catch any newly-added presentation inside the window (low probability but prudent).

4. Recommended next research actions
A. Retrieve HAL daily closes  
 Option 1 – Stooq: download d_us_txt.zip, extract hal.us.txt and filter the specified date range.  
 Option 2 – Alpha Vantage: call TIME_SERIES_DAILY_ADJUSTED with outputsize=full and datatype=csv, then slice the same dates.

B. Calculate 8-day percentage moves and descriptive statistics using Python/Excel.

C. Search for the exact date of the IEA February-2026 Oil Market Report.

Until those additional data pulls are executed, the answer cannot provide the numeric distribution requested by the original query.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
