Analysis:
The price movement of HAL between 5 Feb 2026 and 13 Feb 2026 will probably be driven by:
• The market’s digestion of Halliburton’s Q4-25 earnings (likely released late Jan 2026). Fresh analyst target changes or guidance commentary are key inputs.
• Short-term crude-oil price trends; HAL’s beta to WTI is high and an 8-day window leaves little time for idiosyncratic rerating.
• Any macro news that changes expectations for North-American drilling budgets, OPEC production signals, or U.S. rig counts.
Therefore I need very current material on (1) the post-earnings reaction, (2) analyst revisions in the first week of February, and (3) near-term oil-price/rig-count outlooks. News articles that mention price targets or “momentum into mid-February” will be most useful.
