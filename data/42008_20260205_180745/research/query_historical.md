Analysis:
To judge whether HAL will be higher on 2026-02-13 than on 2026-02-05 I mainly need:  
• Recent price momentum (especially the few weeks surrounding the question date).  
• Any fresh fundamental news (earnings, guidance, analyst upgrades/downgrades, oil-price moves, geopolitical/OPEC developments) scheduled or already released that could plausibly move the stock in the next eight days.  
• Historical 5-10 trading-day return distribution for HAL and its correlation with crude prices to get a base-rate probabilistic view.  
Gathering those items requires: (1) a quick scan of web pages with historical Yahoo charts/numbers, (2) up-to-the-minute news flow and analyst commentary, and (3) a deeper agent-level pull of structured price history and macro schedule for quantitative context.
