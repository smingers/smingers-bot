Broad-based selling in financials, autos, and IT stocks drove the decline. The India VIX declined 0.7% to 12.17. Rupak De, Senior Technical Analyst at LKP Securities, noted that the Nifty closed in the red for three consecutive sessions and remained below its 50-day moving average, indicating near-term pressure, but held above its 20-day exponential moving average, suggesting a narrow trading range. He identified the 25,480\u201325,500 band as a key support zone and 25,875 as a resistance level, expecting range-bound movement until RBI policy cues emerge. Rajesh Bhosale, Technical Analyst at Angel One, stated that the Nifty is in a consolidation phase after a sharp 1200-point rally on Tuesday, remains above all key moving averages, and has a positive RSI above 50, indicating a still-positive broader trend. He emphasized that any dip should be viewed as a buying opportunity if key supports hold, with 25,500 as a crucial support and 25,250 as a strong support near the 200DEMA and 61.8% retracement level. Resistance is seen at 25,750\u201325,850, followed by the psychological 26,000 mark. On the BSE, PB Fintech (Rs 518 crore), HDFC Bank (Rs 383 crore), Kotak Mahindra Bank (Rs 298 crore), RIL (Rs 225 crore), ICICI Bank (Rs 182 crore), Hindustan Copper (Rs 166 crore), and HAL (Rs 162 crore) were the most active stocks by value.

At 10:45 AM, HAL shares were trading at \u20b93,978, down 5.66%. The drop comes after Morgan Stanley, a brokerage firm, revised its rating and target price downward for the defense sector stock.

This follows a previous 8% intra-day drop on February 4, 2026, after media reports claimed HAL was excluded from India\u2019s 5th-generation fighter jet project, marking the first time the company would not be involved in a major defense project. The company confirmed it had not received official information from DRDO and could not comment. Morgan Stanley downgraded HAL\u2019s rating from 'Equal Weight' to 'Underweight' and reduced its target price by 34.11% to \u20b93,355, citing increased private-sector competition, rising global defense spending, and HAL\u2019s reduced pace in fulfilling contracts due to over-reliance on imports. The brokerage also cut its EPS estimates for FY2027 by 2% and FY2028 by 5%. Despite the sell-off, 21 out of 25 analysts still maintain a 'Buy' rating, two have 'Hold', and two have 'Sell'. Over the past year, HAL shares surged 69.60% from a 12-month low of \u20b93,045.95 on March 3, 2025, to a 12-month high of \u20b95,166.00 on May 16, 2025.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 04:03 AM\nSource:[hindi.moneycontrol.com](https://hindi.moneycontrol.com/news/markets/hindustan-aeronautics-hal-share-price-slips-2nd-day-in-a-row-what-should-investors-do-morgan-stanley-cuts-target-price-2361943.html)\n\n**Hindustan Aeronautics shares downgraded by Morgan Stanley with a 34% price target cut - CNBC TV18**\nMorgan Stanley downgraded Hindustan Aeronautics Ltd. (HAL) shares to 'under-weight' from 'equal-weight' and cut its price target by 34%, from \u20b95,092 to \u20b93,355, implying a further 20% downside from Wednesday's closing price of \u20b94,213.9. The downgrade follows concerns over rising private-sector competition, persistent execution risks due to high import dependence, and slower project delivery. Morgan Stanley revised its EPS estimates for FY2027 down by 2% and for FY2028 by 5%. HAL's stock fell 6% on Wednesday, wiping out \u20b918,000 crore in market capitalization, after reports indicated HAL is no longer in the race to build India\u2019s fifth-generation stealth fighter jet and the Advanced Medium Combat Aircraft (AMCA). Despite the downgrade, 21 out of 25 analysts still maintain a 'buy' rating on HAL, with two each holding 'hold' and 'sell' recommendations. HAL\u2019s shares have risen 11% over the past 12 months, and the company has outperformed the Nifty by 4% year-to-date, though its consensus P/E multiple has declined 15% over the last 12 months.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 03:16 AM\nSource:[cnbctv18.com](https://www.cnbctv18.com/market/hindustan-aeronautics-hal-share-price-downgrade-target-cut-morgan-stanley-downside-order-impact-19842685.htm)\n\n**Nifty Outlook: Market Strength Continues Amid IT Sell-Off and Sectoral Divergence**\nThe Indian stock market ended Wednesday on a strong note, closing at a three-week high with the Nifty index trading above 25,750. The market opened weak due to selling pressure in IT stocks, with Nifty dropping to an intraday low of 25,563. However, strong buying at lower levels led to a sharp recovery, and the Nifty closed 48 points higher at 25,776. The IT sector faced a major downturn, with Infosys, TCS, HCLTech, and others falling over 7%, and the Nifty IT index dropping nearly 5% due to concerns over Anthropic AI tools. Infosys saw an 8% drop, and TCS's market cap fell below \u20b911 lakh crore. Five IT stocks in the Nifty 50 erased nearly \u20b92 lakh crore in market cap in the first half. HAL shares dropped 6% after a report claimed the company was out of the stealth fighter jet race, its worst fall since February 3, 2025, with market cap down \u20b918,000 crore since then. Excluding IT and healthcare, all other sectors closed in green, with consumer durables, oil & gas, and metals leading. Midcap and smallcap indices rose 0.63% and 1.27% respectively. Experts from Motilal Oswal, HDFC Securities, SBI Securities, and LKP Securities believe the market remains bullish, with key resistance levels at 26,000\u201326,350 and support at 25,600\u201325,550. The Nifty has closed above its 50-day DEMA (around 25,647), indicating a strong bullish trend. The banking sector showed consolidation after a recent rally, with a breakout above 60,000 in the Nifty Bank index signaling strength. Experts recommend a 'buy on dips' strategy as long as the index remains above short-term moving averages.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 02:11 PM\nSource:[hindi.moneycontrol.com](https://hindi.moneycontrol.com/news/markets/nifty-outlook-at-three-week-high-what-to-expect-on-5-february-key-levels-support-resistance-expert-view-2361525.html)\n\n**HAL Share Plunge: Company Excluded from India\u2019s Next-Gen Fighter Jet Project**\nHindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) experienced a sharp decline in its share price, falling 8% and becoming the worst-performing stock of the day on February 4, 2026. The company was excluded from the selection process for India\u2019s next-generation fighter jet project, which was awarded to L&T and three other private firms. This decision triggered heavy selling pressure on HAL shares, with the stock trading at \u20b94,237 as of 12:15 PM on the National Stock Exchange, down 5.36% from the previous close. The intraday low reached \u20b94,097.60 during the session, reflecting significant market reaction to the loss of a major defense contract.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 06:58 AM\nSource:[hindi.moneycontrol.com](https://hindi.moneycontrol.com/news/markets/hal-shares-fall-company-out-from-indias-stealth-fighter-jet-project-hal-shares-drop-by-8-percent-2361016.html)\n\n**HAL share price slides 8%: Why is the PSU defence stock falling? Explained | Stock Market News**\nHindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) shares fell 8% to \u20b94,100.15 on February 4, 2026, after the company was not shortlisted for India's Advanced Multirole Combat Aircraft (AMCA) programme, a major setback for the state-owned defence PSU. The stock opened at \u20b94,220, down from the previous close of \u20b94,470, and hit a daily low of \u20b94,100.15. HAL, long regarded as India's primary fighter aircraft manufacturer, was widely expected to lead the AMCA project following Defence Minister Rajnath Singh\u2019s approval of the industry partnership model. However, the seven bidders\u2014including Tata Advanced Systems, Adani Defence, L&T-BEL consortium, Goodluck India-BrahMos Aerospace, and Bharat Forge-BEML-Data Patterns\u2014underwent evaluation by a committee of DRDO officials and a panel chaired by Defence Secretary Rajesh Kumar Singh. Under the competitive framework, shortlisted firms must demonstrate capability to establish serial production facilities and complete development, prototyping, flight testing, and certification within eight years. The exclusion threatens HAL\u2019s access to a significant, long-term revenue stream. Despite the drop, HAL has delivered 731% returns over five years. The stock has declined 7.23% in six months and 4.27% year-to-date, though it remains in a long-term uptrend. Technical analyst Hitesh Tailor noted the stock is in a sideways consolidation between \u20b94,000 and \u20b94,500, with key support at the 100-week EMA near \u20b94,100 and resistance at the 50-week EMA (\u20b94,450\u2013\u20b94,550).
