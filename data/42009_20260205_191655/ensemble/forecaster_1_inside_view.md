## (a) Source Analysis

**High-Quality News Sources (Jan 31 - Feb 5, 2026):**

The Athletic, New York Times, CNBC, BBC, CNN, NBC News, ESPN, AP, ABC News - all published between Jan 31 - Feb 5, 2026. These are tier-1 news organizations providing factual reporting on:
- DOJ release of 3+ million Epstein files on Jan 30-31, 2026
- Steve Tisch's name appearing 400+ times in emails from 2013
- Email content showing Epstein connecting Tisch with women
- Tisch's statement (Jan 31): "brief association," discussed "adult women," never visited island, "deeply regret"
- NFL Commissioner Goodell's statement (Feb 3): "Absolutely we will look at all the facts"

**Key Factual Timeline:**
- Jan 30-31: Files released, immediate media coverage
- Jan 31: Tisch issues statement
- Feb 2-3: NFL announces investigation at Super Bowl press conference
- Feb 5: Current date (question opens)

**Critical Agent Report Finding:** NO scheduled public appearances, press conferences, or events for Steve Tisch between Feb 5-13. This is strong evidence against new catalysts.

**Google Trends Historical Data:** 
- Jan 31: Value = 100 (peak)
- Feb 1: Value = 26
- Feb 5: Value = 5 (stated in question background)
- Historical base rate: 92% of 8-day windows show ≤3 point changes

**International Coverage (Feb 3-4):** Spanish-language sources (Aristegui, BioBioChile, AFP) and Swedish (Aftonbladet) confirm story has international reach but are reporting same facts, not new developments.

**Non-Tisch Epstein Coverage:** BBC article (Feb 3) comprehensively covers other names in files (Musk, Gates, Trump, Branson, Mandelson) but notably does NOT mention Tisch, suggesting his story may be receding from headline focus.

**Opinion vs. Fact:** Most sources are factual reporting. One opinion piece from The Athletic (Ian O'Connor) calls for Tisch to be fined/suspended, but this is clearly labeled commentary, not news development.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence for "Doesn't Change":**
1. **No scheduled catalysts (Feb 5-13):** Agent report confirms zero public appearances or events. Without new information, Google Trends typically stabilize. This is structural evidence.
2. **Story age:** 5 days old as of Feb 5. News cycle analysis shows scandal stories without new developments typically complete their decay curve within 3-7 days.
3. **Current stabilization pattern:** Value held at 5 for Feb 4-5 (per question background stating "current value...is 26" on Feb 1, but verification URL would show Feb 5 value). The slowing decay suggests approaching baseline.
4. **Historical base rate:** 92% of 8-day windows show ≤3 point changes - very strong statistical pattern.

**Moderate Evidence for "Decreases":**
1. **Distance from baseline:** Current value of 5 vs. typical baseline of 0-2 means a 3-5 point drop would return to normal, triggering "Decreases" (>3 point drop).
2. **Typical decay pattern:** Scandal-driven spikes almost always return to baseline unless sustained by new developments.
3. **Super Bowl distraction:** Feb 9 is Super Bowl LIX. Media attention will shift away from Tisch (whose team isn't playing) to the game.

**Weak Evidence for "Increases":**
1. **NFL investigation ongoing:** Could produce new statements, but no indication of imminent developments.
2. **Congressional Democrats claim only "half" of files released:** Could trigger second release, but no timeline indicated.
3. **Unexpected leaks:** Always possible but unpredictable and low probability in 8-day window.

**Evidence Against "Increases":**
1. **Tisch not in Super Bowl spotlight:** Giants didn't make playoffs. Unlike if he were involved in the game, there's no natural news hook.
2. **Other Epstein names dominating:** BBC's comprehensive Feb 3 article on Epstein files doesn't mention Tisch, suggesting media focus has shifted to bigger names (Trump, Musk, Gates).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 8 days (Feb 5 to Feb 13, 2026)

**Current position:** Feb 5, value = 5 (down from 100 on Jan 31)

**If timeframe were 4 days (halved):**
- Higher confidence in "Doesn't change" (85%)
- Lower chance of "Decreases" (10%) - less time to drift back to baseline
- Lower chance of "Increases" (5%) - less time for unexpected developments

**If timeframe were 16 days (doubled):**
- Lower confidence in "Doesn't change" (60%)
- Higher chance of "Decreases" (30%) - more time to return to baseline 0-2
- Higher chance of "Increases" (10%) - more time for NFL investigation updates or new file releases

**Key dates in window:**
- Feb 9: Super Bowl LIX (media distraction from Tisch)
- Feb 13: Resolution date
- No known Tisch-related events scheduled

## (d) Justification

**Outside view base rate: 92% "Doesn't change"**

**Factors supporting base rate maintenance:**

1. **Structural factor - No catalysts:** The agent report's finding of zero scheduled appearances is decisive. Google Trends movements require news triggers. Without them, values stabilize.

2. **News cycle completion:** The story is 5 days old with comprehensive coverage already published. The "information cascade" phase is complete. All major outlets have reported the basic facts. Absent new revelations, there's no reason for renewed search interest.

3. **Current value positioning:** At 5, we're in a zone where both "Doesn't change" (staying 2-8) and "Decreases" (dropping to 0-2) are plausible. However, the stabilization at 5 for multiple days suggests we may have found a new equilibrium slightly above baseline, possibly due to ongoing NFL investigation awareness.

**Factors warranting modest downward adjustment from 92% base rate:**

1. **Elevated baseline risk:** Being at 5 instead of 0-2 means we're closer to triggering "Decreases" (drop >3 to reach 0-2) than "Increases" (rise >3 to reach 8+). The asymmetry favors decrease.

2. **Super Bowl effect:** Feb 9 will dominate sports news. This could accelerate return to baseline as Tisch becomes less newsworthy.

3. **Decay momentum:** While slowing, the value did drop 14 points (19→5) in the most recent 2-day period, suggesting decay isn't fully arrested.

**Factors warranting modest upward adjustment for "Increases":**

1. **NFL investigation:** While no timeline is public, the NFL could issue statements or leaks could emerge about their findings. This is the primary upside risk.

2. **Congressional pressure:** Democrats claiming only "half" of files released could trigger renewed media coverage if second release is announced.

However, these factors are speculative and low-probability within an 8-day window.

**Probability Calibration:**

Starting from 92% base rate for "Doesn't change":

**Adjustment for "Decreases":** +10 percentage points
- Rationale: Current value of 5 is only 3 points from triggering "Decreases" threshold if it drops to 1 or 0. The natural decay pattern and Super Bowl distraction make this moderately likely.

**Adjustment for "Increases":** +3 percentage points  
- Rationale: NFL investigation is active, but no scheduled developments. Very low probability of spike >8 (from 5) without major new revelations.

**Final adjustment for "Doesn't change":** -13 percentage points (to balance)

This yields: Decreases 18%, Doesn't change 74%, Increases 8%

However, I need to reconsider the resolution mechanics more carefully:

**Critical insight:** The question states value on Feb 5 is the baseline for comparison. If the value on Feb 5 is 5, then:
- "Doesn't change" = Feb 13 value is 2-8 (within ±3 of 5)
- "Increases" = Feb 13 value is 9+ (more than 3 above 5)
- "Decreases" = Feb 13 value is 0-1 (more than 3 below 5)

**Recalibration:**

Given the value has stabilized at 5 for Feb 4-5, the most likely scenario is it remains in the 3-7 range through Feb 13, which would all resolve as "Doesn't change."

For "Decreases" to occur, it must drop to 0-1 (baseline). This is possible but requires complete return to pre-scandal baseline.

For "Increases" to occur, it must rise to 9+. This requires significant new developments.

**Revised assessment:**

The ±3 threshold is actually quite generous. It allows the value to range from 2-8 while still counting as "no change." Given:
- Stabilization at 5
- No scheduled catalysts
- Natural tendency toward baseline but slow decay rate
- 8-day window

The most likely outcome is the value stays in the 3-6 range, all of which resolve as "Doesn't change."

**Blind spots:**
1. **Unexpected NFL investigation leak:** Could spike interest suddenly
2. **Second DOJ file release announced:** Would restart news cycle
3. **Tisch makes unexpected public statement:** Could reignite coverage
4. **Another high-profile figure's Epstein connection revealed:** Could create "Epstein fatigue" and suppress Tisch searches OR could reignite interest in all connected individuals

These are all low-probability but non-zero events.

## Probability Calibration

**Base rate:** 92% "Doesn't change" from historical patterns

**Adjustments:**

The generous ±3 threshold works in favor of "Doesn't change." From a value of 5:
- Dropping to 2 = "Doesn't change" (still within range)
- Dropping to 1 = "Decreases" (4-point drop)
- Rising to 8 = "Doesn't change" (still within range)  
- Rising to 9 = "Increases" (4-point rise)

Given stabilization pattern and lack of catalysts, staying in 2-8 range is highly probable.

**Risk of "Decreases":** The value could return to baseline 0-1, but the stabilization at 5 suggests this decay has slowed. Estimate 12% chance of dropping to 0-1.

**Risk of "Increases":** Requires new developments to push from 5 to 9+. Very low probability without scheduled events. Estimate 5% chance.

**"Doesn't change" probability:** 83% (1.00 - 0.12 - 0.05)

**Final calibration check:**
- 83% = 4.9:1 odds favoring "Doesn't change" - feels right given strong structural factors (no catalysts, stabilization, generous threshold)
- 12% = 1:7.3 odds against "Decreases" - reasonable given some decay momentum remains
- 5% = 1:19 odds against "Increases" - appropriate for low-probability scenario requiring unexpected developments

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Google Trends value for "steve tisch" on Feb 13 be within ±3 of Feb 5 value (5), more than 3 higher, or more than 3 lower?

2. **Base rate:** 92% "Doesn't change" from historical 8-day windows

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = Doesn't change (value stays 2-8); Least likely = Increases (requires unexpected news); Makes sense given stabilization and no catalysts

4. **Key evidence:**
   - No scheduled Tisch appearances Feb 5-13 (agent report)
   - Value stabilized at 5 after initial spike decay
   - ±3 threshold is generous (allows 2-8 range)
   - Story is 5 days old with no new developments scheduled
   - Super Bowl Feb 9 will distract media attention

5. **Blind spot:** Unexpected NFL investigation leak or second DOJ file release announcement would make forecast look silly. Would shift 15-20 points from "Doesn't change" to "Increases."

6. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs, all between 0-100

Probabilities: [5, 83, 12]
