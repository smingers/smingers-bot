Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**The Guardian (Feb 2, 2026):** High-quality mainstream news source reporting on NFL investigation into Steve Tisch's connection to Jeffrey Epstein. Key facts: Tisch's name appears 400+ times in DOJ-released emails from 2013, NFL announced investigation on Feb 2. Commissioner Goodell stated they will "look at all the facts." This is factual reporting with direct quotes from official sources.

**WSLS/AP (Feb 2, 2026):** Wire service coverage from Goodell's Super Bowl week press conference. Confirms NFL will investigate Tisch, with similar quotes. Factual reporting from credible source at official NFL event.

**BBC Sport (Feb 4, 2026):** Comprehensive international coverage one day before forecasting period begins. Reports NFL is "deliberating whether to conduct a formal investigation." High-quality factual reporting with direct statements from involved parties.

**CNBC (Jan 31, 2026):** Financial news outlet reporting on initial DOJ file release. First major coverage naming Tisch, published Jan 31. Includes Tisch's denial statement. Factual reporting from credible source.

**The Guardian - Takeaways (Feb 2, 2026):** Summary article noting Tisch mentioned "several hundred times" in files. Factual compilation from primary source documents.

**CNN (Feb 3, 2026):** Major news network coverage specifically highlighting Tisch as "a new face in the documents." Confirms NFL will investigate. High-quality factual reporting.

**Agent Report:** Confirms NO scheduled appearances for Tisch between Feb 5-13. This is crucial - no press conferences, NFL events, or public appearances planned during the forecast window. The report methodology appears thorough, checking multiple sources.

**Google Trends Data:** Shows dramatic spike on Jan 31 (value: 100) when files were released, followed by rapid decline to 5 by Feb 5. Historical base rate: 92% of 8-day windows show ≤3 point changes.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **Celebrity scandal news cycles:** Typically show sharp initial spike followed by rapid decay unless new developments occur
2. **NFL owner controversies:** Historical patterns show sustained interest during investigation phases
3. **Epstein-related search patterns:** Previous file releases show intense but brief spikes
4. **Generic Google Trends 8-day windows for this topic:** 92% show ≤3 point changes

**Most suitable reference class:** The Google Trends historical base rate for this specific topic is most relevant. The 92% "no change" rate across 8-day windows provides the strongest empirical foundation. However, this must be adjusted for:
- The current elevated baseline (5 on Feb 5 vs. typical 0-2)
- Recent major news event (Jan 31 file release)
- Typical news decay patterns

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 8 days (Feb 5-13, 2026)

**Current situation (Feb 5):** 
- Value is 5, down from peak of 100 on Jan 31
- Story broke Jan 31, major coverage Jan 31-Feb 4
- We are now 5 days post-initial revelation
- No new scheduled developments in forecast window

**Historical patterns:**
- Baseline for "steve tisch" is typically 0-2
- Recent 7-day average before scandal: 0.0
- Last 7 days (scandal period): 27.6
- Current trajectory: Declining sharply (100→24→19→19→5→5)

**Key observation:** The value has already declined 95% from peak and appears to be stabilizing near baseline levels.

## (d) Justification

The outside view strongly suggests "Doesn't change" for several reasons:

1. **News cycle completion:** The Epstein files story broke Jan 31, received intensive coverage through Feb 4, and is now 5+ days old with no new developments scheduled.

2. **No catalysts in forecast window:** The agent report confirms zero scheduled appearances, press conferences, or events involving Tisch between Feb 5-13. The NFL investigation announcement has already occurred (Feb 2).

3. **Typical decay pattern observed:** The value dropped from 100 to 5 in 5 days, suggesting the initial shock has dissipated. Further decline to 0-2 (baseline) would only be a 3-5 point drop.

4. **Historical base rate:** 92% of 8-day windows show ≤3 point changes for this topic.

5. **Super Bowl timing:** While it's Super Bowl week, Tisch is not involved in the game (Giants didn't make playoffs), and the NFL has already made its statement about investigating.

The question is whether the value will:
- **Increase >3 points:** Would require new revelations or developments (none scheduled)
- **Decrease >3 points:** Would require dropping from 5 to below 2 (possible as it returns to baseline)
- **Stay within ±3:** Most likely given stabilization pattern and lack of catalysts

Outside View Calibration:

The base rate of 92% for "no change" is compelling but requires adjustment:

1. **Current position relative to baseline:** At 5, we're only 3-5 points above the typical baseline of 0-2. A return to baseline would trigger "Decreases" resolution.

2. **Decay trajectory:** The sharp decline pattern (100→24→19→5) suggests continued decay is likely, but the rate of decline is slowing (19→5 over 2 days = 7 points/day, now appears stable at 5).

3. **Weekend effect:** The forecast window includes Feb 8-9 (weekend), when news cycles typically slow, reducing chances of new spikes.

4. **Probability of new developments:** Very low given no scheduled events, but non-zero (unexpected leaks, statements, or NFL investigation updates could occur).

5. **Upsets in this domain:** News-driven Google Trends can be volatile, but without catalysts, sustained changes are rare. The domain shows high stability once initial shock dissipates.

**Calibration considerations:**
- The value staying at 5 for Feb 4-5 suggests possible stabilization
- Dropping to 2 (baseline) = 3-point decrease = still "Doesn't change"
- Dropping to 1 or 0 = 4-5 point decrease = "Decreases"
- Any new news could spike it, but probability is low

Given the stabilization at 5, the most likely scenario is continued stability or gradual return toward baseline. The question's ±3 threshold is generous, allowing movement from 5 to anywhere between 2-8 to count as "no change."

Outside View Prediction:

Increases: 8%
Doesn't change: 74%
Decreases: 18%
