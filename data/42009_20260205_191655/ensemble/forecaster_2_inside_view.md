Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary News Articles (Jan 31 - Feb 5, 2026):**

1. **The Athletic (Jan 30/31)**: Original investigative piece revealing Epstein-Tisch emails from 2013. High-quality journalism with direct document evidence. FACTUAL: Email exchanges, dates, specific quotes. OPINION: Characterizations like "scouting reports" (editorial framing).

2. **CNBC, BBC, CNN (Jan 31 - Feb 3)**: Major outlets confirming the story with consistent facts about the DOJ document release (3M+ pages on Jan 30/31) and Tisch's statement. All FACTUAL on core details; minimal opinion beyond attributed quotes.

3. **NBC News (Feb 5)**: Most recent article noting NFL Commissioner Goodell's statement that league will "look at all the facts." FACTUAL: Goodell's commitment to review. OPINION: Speculation about potential consequences.

4. **AskNews Articles (Feb 2-3, 2026)**: Multiple international outlets (Spanish, Swedish sources) confirming NFL investigation announcement on Feb 3. FACTUAL: Goodell press conference, investigation announcement. High consistency across sources strengthens credibility.

5. **ESPN, Yahoo Sports, AP (Feb 2-3)**: Wire services and sports outlets with consistent timeline. FACTUAL: Tisch appeared 440+ times in documents, emails from 2013, NFL will investigate.

**Key Factual Timeline:**
- Jan 30/31: DOJ releases Epstein files
- Jan 31: Initial media reports, Tisch statement issued
- Feb 3: NFL Commissioner announces investigation at Super Bowl press conference
- Feb 5: Question opens; current Google Trends value = 5

**Quality Assessment:** Sources are highly credible (major news outlets, consistent facts across independent reporting). The only expert opinions are from Tisch (self-serving denial) and Goodell (procedural commitment to investigate). No independent expert analysis predicting future search interest.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE for "Doesn't change":**
1. **Historical base rate (92%)**: Over 82 rolling 8-day windows in past 90 days, 92% showed |Δ| ≤ 3. This is structural evidence about typical search behavior for this topic.
2. **Decay pattern already established**: Value dropped from 100 (Jan 31) → 26 (Feb 1) → 5 (Feb 5). This 95% decay over 5 days follows typical scandal-spike patterns where interest collapses rapidly after initial revelation.
3. **No scheduled catalysts**: Agent report confirms no press conferences, hearings, or Giants events during Feb 5-13 window. NFL investigation is procedural and slow-moving.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE for "Doesn't change":**
1. **Super Bowl timing**: The NFL's biggest event (Feb 9, 2026) will dominate sports news cycle, likely drowning out secondary stories about team owners.
2. **Story completeness**: All major facts were revealed Jan 30-31. Subsequent coverage (Feb 1-5) added no new revelations, only reactions. Without fresh information, media interest typically fades.

**WEAK EVIDENCE for "Increases":**
1. **NFL investigation announcement (Feb 3)**: Could theoretically reignite interest, but the announcement itself was 2 days ago and hasn't reversed the decay trend (value still at 5 on Feb 5).
2. **Potential for leaks/developments**: NFL investigations can produce news, but typically unfold over weeks/months, not days.

**WEAK EVIDENCE for "Decreases":**
1. **Already at low baseline (5)**: Further significant drops (to ≤1) are possible but rare in historical data, as search interest tends to stabilize at low levels rather than collapse to zero.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window:** 8 days (Feb 5-13, 2026)

**If halved to 4 days (Feb 5-9):**
- Would slightly increase "Doesn't change" probability to ~92%, as shorter windows have less time for random fluctuations or unexpected news.
- Super Bowl (Feb 9) would dominate the shorter window even more completely.

**If doubled to 16 days (Feb 5-21):**
- Would moderately decrease "Doesn't change" to ~80-85%, as longer windows allow more opportunity for:
  - NFL investigation developments
  - Secondary news cycles
  - Random volatility in low-volume search terms
- "Increases" might rise to 12-15% over 16 days.

The 8-day window sits in a "goldilocks" zone: long enough that something could theoretically happen, but short enough that the historical stability dominates.

## (d) Justification for Adjusting Outside View

**Outside view base rate:** Increases 10%, Doesn't change 88%, Decreases 2%

**Key factors to consider:**

1. **Timing of spike relative to forecast window**: The scandal broke Jan 30-31, creating the search spike. By Feb 5 (when forecast opens), we're already 5-6 days post-revelation and the value has collapsed 95%. Historical patterns show scandal-driven spikes decay rapidly and rarely re-spike without new catalysts within days.

2. **Super Bowl effect (Feb 9)**: This is a massive media event that will dominate sports coverage Feb 7-10. Even if Tisch-related news emerged, it would struggle for oxygen. This is a structural factor favoring stability.

3. **NFL investigation mechanics**: Goodell's Feb 3 announcement commits to a review, but NFL investigations are bureaucratic processes taking weeks/months. The investigation itself is unlikely to produce newsworthy developments within 8 days.

4. **Current value (5) near historical floor**: At value=5, the term is already at ~5th percentile of its 90-day range. Further collapse (to ≤1) would require near-total abandonment of search interest, which is rare. The floor effect provides a natural brake on "Decreases."

5. **Absence of scheduled catalysts**: No press conferences, congressional hearings, Giants games, or other predictable events during Feb 5-13 that could drive renewed interest.

**Adjustment reasoning:**
- The 88% base rate for "Doesn't change" feels well-calibrated. The current circumstances (post-spike decay, Super Bowl timing, no catalysts) reinforce rather than contradict the historical pattern.
- I'll make a **small downward adjustment** to "Increases" (10% → 8%) because the Super Bowl provides an additional structural barrier to renewed interest that wasn't fully captured in the base rate.
- I'll make a **small upward adjustment** to "Doesn't change" (88% → 90%) to reflect the confluence of favorable factors.
- "Decreases" stays at 2%, acknowledging the floor effect prevents confident prediction of further collapse.

## Probability Calibration

**Base rate:** Increases 10%, Doesn't change 88%, Decreases 2%

**Inside view adjustments:**
- Super Bowl effect: -2pp from Increases, +2pp to Doesn't change
- Post-spike decay pattern: Already reflected in base rate
- Floor effect at value=5: Maintains 2% for Decreases
- No new catalysts: Reinforces base rate, no adjustment needed

**Calibrated probabilities:**
- Increases: 8%
- Doesn't change: 90%
- Decreases: 2%

**Confidence check:** 
- 90% for "Doesn't change" implies 9:1 odds. Given the 92% historical base rate, strong decay pattern, Super Bowl timing, and absence of catalysts, this feels appropriately confident without being extreme.
- 8% for "Increases" (12.5:1 against) acknowledges that unexpected news can emerge, but assigns low probability given the structural barriers.
- 2% for "Decreases" (49:1 against) reflects that while theoretically possible from value=5, historical data shows this is very rare.

**Blind spots:**
1. **Unexpected news leak**: If new Epstein documents or witness testimony specifically about Tisch emerges Feb 6-12, search interest could spike. However, the DOJ dump was comprehensive and subsequent days produced no new revelations.
2. **Political/social media amplification**: A viral social media campaign or political figure highlighting Tisch could drive searches. Low probability but not zero.
3. **Measurement noise**: Google Trends values at low levels (5) can be noisy. A value of 8 might register as 5 or 7 depending on scaling. This noise works both ways but is captured in the ±3 threshold.

Given these blind spots, I maintain 90% confidence in "Doesn't change" rather than pushing higher.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Google Trends value for "steve tisch" on Feb 13 be within ±3 of Feb 5 value (currently 5), or increase >3, or decrease >3?

2. **Base rate**: Increases 10%, Doesn't change 88%, Decreases 2% from historical 8-day windows.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = Doesn't change (90%); Least likely = Decreases (2%). Makes sense: post-spike decay + Super Bowl + no catalysts strongly favor stability.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - 92% historical base rate for no change over 8 days (STRONG)
   - Value already decayed 95% from Jan 31 spike to Feb 5 (STRONG)
   - Super Bowl Feb 9 will dominate news cycle (MODERATE)
   - No scheduled Tisch-related events Feb 5-13 (STRONG)
   - NFL investigation procedural, slow-moving (MODERATE)

5. **Blind spot**: Unexpected document leak or viral social media campaign could spike interest. If this occurs, forecast would look overly confident in stability. However, probability remains low given comprehensive Jan 30 release.

6. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [8, 90, 2]
