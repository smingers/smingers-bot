Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**The Guardian (Feb 2, 2026)**: High-quality mainstream news source reporting on NFL's announcement to investigate Tisch-Epstein connections. Key facts: 400+ mentions in DOJ emails from 2013, NFL Commissioner Goodell confirming investigation, Tisch's public statement. This is factual reporting of verifiable events.

**WSLS/Associated Press (Feb 2, 2026)**: Credible wire service reporting Goodell's Super Bowl week press conference. Confirms NFL will investigate Tisch. Factual coverage of official statements.

**BBC Sport (Feb 4, 2026)**: Reputable international outlet providing comprehensive coverage of Epstein files release. Details specific email exchanges and NFL's deliberation on formal investigation. Factual reporting with direct quotes.

**CNBC (Jan 31, 2026)**: Major financial news outlet reporting the initial DOJ document release on Jan 31. First public disclosure of Tisch's name in files. Includes Tisch's official statement. Factual reporting of document release.

**The Guardian (Feb 2, 2026) - "10 key takeaways"**: Summary article aggregating major revelations from the files. Mentions Tisch "several hundred times" but article appears cut off.

**CNN (Feb 3, 2026)**: Major news network analyzing boldface names in files. Provides specific email excerpts and NFL's Monday statement about investigating. Factual reporting with context.

**Agent Report (Feb 5, 2026)**: Systematic search for scheduled appearances. Finds NO confirmed public appearances, media availabilities, or events for Tisch between Feb 5-13. Notes only unscheduled possibility of NFL investigation. This is highly relevant negative information.

**Google Trends Data**: Objective quantitative data showing massive spike on Jan 31 (value=100, the peak), declining to 5 by Feb 4-5. 90-day base rate shows 92% of 8-day windows have changes ≤3 points.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **Google Trends for scandal-related searches after peak news day**: Most relevant. The Jan 31 spike (100) represents the initial revelation. By Feb 5, interest has declined to 5. Question asks about Feb 5-13 period.
2. **Celebrity/executive scandal news cycles**: Typically peak immediately upon revelation, then decay rapidly unless new developments occur.
3. **NFL owner controversies during off-season**: Interest tends to be episodic, tied to specific news events or league actions.

**Most suitable reference class**: Google Trends behavior for scandal-related searches after peak revelation, specifically examining decay patterns when no new catalyzing events occur.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 8 days (Feb 5-13, 2026)

**Key timeline observations:**
- Jan 31: Document release, search interest peaks at 100
- Feb 1-3: Sustained elevated interest (19-24 range) as media coverage proliferates
- Feb 4-5: Sharp decline to 5 (a 74-79% drop from Feb 1-3 levels)
- Feb 5 is the START of our prediction window

**Historical pattern from Google Trends data:**
- Base rate: 92% of 8-day windows show changes ≤3 points ("Doesn't change")
- 8% show increases >3 points
- 0% show decreases >3 points
- However, this base rate includes mostly low-activity periods (90-day mean: 2.2)

**Current context differs from base rate:**
- We're starting from value=5 on Feb 5
- This is elevated compared to the 90-day mean of 2.2
- But dramatically lower than the Jan 31-Feb 3 peak period
- The scandal news broke Jan 31; by Feb 5 we're already 5 days into the news cycle

## (d) Justification

The outside view strongly suggests "Doesn't change" based on several factors:

1. **News cycle decay pattern**: The Epstein files story broke Jan 31 with peak interest (100). By Feb 5, interest has already declined 95% to value=5. This represents a typical scandal news cycle where initial revelation drives searches, followed by rapid decay without new developments.

2. **Absence of catalyzing events**: The Agent Report found NO scheduled appearances, press conferences, or NFL hearings for Tisch during Feb 5-13. The NFL stated it will investigate but provided no timeline. Without new news, search interest typically continues declining or stabilizes at low levels.

3. **Base rate evidence**: In 92% of historical 8-day windows, values changed by ≤3 points. Starting from 5, this means the range 2-8 is most likely.

4. **Super Bowl timing**: While Super Bowl week (Feb 2-9) generates massive NFL media attention, Tisch is not participating in media events. The scandal coverage peaked during Goodell's Feb 2 press conference; no follow-up NFL action is scheduled.

5. **Decay trajectory**: The decline from 100→24→19→19→5 over Jan 31-Feb 5 shows exponential decay. Absent new stimulus, continued decay to ~2-3 range (the 90-day baseline) or stabilization at 4-6 range is most likely.

**Potential increase scenarios (lower probability):**
- NFL announces formal investigation/hearing during Feb 5-13
- New Epstein documents released mentioning Tisch
- Tisch makes unexpected public statement
- Giants organization news involving Tisch

The Agent Report explicitly found none of these scheduled.

**Potential decrease scenarios (moderate probability):**
- Continued natural decay from 5 toward baseline ~2
- This would require dropping to ≤1 (decrease >3 points from 5)
- Given the value is already near baseline, further large drops are possible but represent reaching floor

Outside view calibration:

## (a) True probability vs hedging
I must assess the genuine likelihood of each outcome, not hedge toward 33-33-33. The data strongly points toward stability or continued minor decline.

## (b) Previously established distributions
The Google Trends base rate provides clear guidance: 92% of 8-day windows show changes ≤3 points. However, this base rate was calculated during mostly low-activity periods. Our current situation (starting at 5, just after a major spike) may behave differently.

## (c) Probability significance
- 92% = 11.5:1 odds for "Doesn't change" under base rate
- However, we're in an unusual post-spike decay period
- The question is whether value stays in range 2-8, drops to ≤1, or rises to ≥9

## (d) Rate of unexpected outcomes
In scandal news cycles, unexpected developments (new revelations, surprise statements, regulatory action) occur perhaps 10-20% of the time in a given week. However, the Agent Report's finding of zero scheduled events substantially reduces this probability for our specific timeframe.

**Key calibration considerations:**

1. **"Doesn't change" (2-8 range)**: The value starting at 5 makes this range very plausible. Even continued decay to 2-3 would qualify. The base rate of 92% seems too high given post-spike context, but 70-80% seems reasonable.

2. **"Decreases" (≤1)**: Requires dropping to 1 or 0. Given we're at 5 and the baseline is ~2.2, dropping to 0-1 is possible but would require complete exhaustion of residual interest. Perhaps 15-25% probability.

3. **"Increases" (≥9)**: Requires nearly doubling from 5 to 9+. This would need a new catalyst (unscheduled NFL announcement, new documents, unexpected statement). The Agent Report found no scheduled events. Historical base rate shows 8% of windows have increases >3, but most of those were from baseline ~2 to modest spikes, not re-acceleration after a major spike. Perhaps 5-10% probability.

**Final calibration**: 
- Doesn't change: 73%
- Decreases: 22%
- Increases: 5%

This reflects high confidence in stability/modest decline, moderate possibility of decay to floor, and low but non-negligible chance of unexpected catalyst.

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 5%
Doesn't change: 73%
Decreases: 22%
