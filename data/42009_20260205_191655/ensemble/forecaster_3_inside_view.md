Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria / options (paraphrase)
- Compare Google Trends US “steve tisch” value on 2026-02-05 vs 2026-02-13 (fixed URL window 2026-01-14 to 2026-02-13).  
- “Doesn’t change” if Feb 13 is within ±3 of Feb 5; “Increases” if > +3; “Decreases” if < −3.

(a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality/date)

High-quality, primary-news reporting on Epstein-files/Tisch:
- The Athletic (Jan 31, 2026): Investigative-style reporting with specific email excerpts; high credibility; clear factual claims + Tisch statement. Likely a key driver of the initial spike.
- CNBC (Jan 31, 2026): Mainstream outlet summarizing DOJ release and notable names; reliable for “what was released” and quoting statements (factual).
- CNN (Feb 3, 2026): Secondary analysis but still high-quality; highlights Tisch as a “new face” + includes NFL “will look into it” angle. Good for “continuing coverage”.
- NBC News (Feb 5, 2026): “Key takeaways” framing; reliable outlet; tends to sustain attention for a day but less likely to create a *new* Tisch-specific spike unless new revelations are reported.

Sports-wire / broad pickup (amplification, not new facts):
- AP / AP pickup (Feb 2, 2026): Very reliable for Goodell/NFL statements; this is the “official confirmation” that can extend the story a bit.
- ESPN (Feb 2, 2026), People.com (Feb 2-3, 2026), Yahoo Sports (Feb 2, 2026), AFP syndication (Feb 3, 2026), various international reprints: Generally factual re-reporting of the same elements (440+ mentions; 2013 emails; NFL review; Tisch statement). These broaden reach, but mostly don’t add new catalysts after Feb 2-3.
- Heavy / For The Win (Feb 3, 2026): More commentary/angle-driven. Useful mainly as evidence of “the topic is still circulating,” but lower signal for predicting a *renewed* spike.

Lower-tier / niche sources:
- Tufts Daily (Feb 2026): Student paper; may have limited direct national reach, but indicates ongoing “second-wave analysis” and institutional monitoring. Moderate credibility, smaller audience.
- Entertainment/toy sites (Feb 1-2, 2026) mentioning Steve Tisch as producer of Masters of the Universe: likely weak driver; could add a small background trickle of searches but usually dwarfed by scandal-related attention.

Key factual vs opinion separation:
- Factual: DOJ files released; emails exist; Goodell said NFL will look/review; Tisch issued statement denying wrongdoing and island visit.
- Opinion/speculation: calls to force sale/resignation; conjecture about penalties/timeline; “may face” sanctions. These can fuel clicks but don’t guarantee a Trends jump unless tied to a concrete event.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to the resolution)

Strong evidence
1) “Big initial revelation already happened” (Jan 31) and is now in the follow-on phase. Multiple top-tier sources show the peak catalyst has passed. This strongly favors either stabilization near a low level or continued decay rather than a renewed rise.
2) NFL/Goodell confirmation occurred Feb 2-3 and is widely syndicated. This is a real mechanism for keeping the term alive, but it already likely contributed to Feb 2-5 residual attention—i.e., it’s not clearly a *new* Feb 6-13 catalyst.

Moderate evidence
3) “More Epstein files expected / only partial release” narrative (NBC/CNN/others). This moderately increases the chance of an additional Tisch-specific headline within the window, which is the main route to “Increases” (Feb13 ≥ Feb5 + 4).
4) Super Bowl media ecosystem (context: Goodell comments during Super Bowl week). This can keep peripheral scandals circulating, but attention typically shifts quickly once the game ends—mixed effect.

Weak evidence
5) Masters of the Universe producer-credit mentions: weak and likely too small to move the index by >3 in a scandal-dominated period.

Implications for options:
- Doesn’t change (within ±3): supported by post-spike decay + absence of a clearly scheduled “next big Tisch moment.”
- Decreases (≤ −4): plausible if residual attention fully burns off by Feb 13 and the series returns to near-floor (0–1).
- Increases (≥ +4): needs a fresh, Tisch-forward headline (new tranche implicating him more, Giants/NFL action, or a viral moment). Possible but not the modal outcome.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Window length: 8 days (from Feb 5 to Feb 13).
- If halved (~4 days): fewer opportunities for new revelations; I’d shift probability toward “Doesn’t change.”
- If doubled (~16 days): more time for either (i) complete decay to floor (raising “Decreases”) or (ii) a second-wave revelation (raising “Increases”); “Doesn’t change” would fall.

(d) Justification: updating the outside view to an inside view

Outside view baseline (given): [Increases 5, Doesn’t change 73, Decreases 22].

Why adjust:
- Compared with a generic low-variance 8-day window, we are in an “aftershock” period of a major national story. That makes the reference class (“mostly quiet periods”) less analogous.
- However, the available reporting suggests the *major* new information entered on Jan 31, then the “NFL will look into it” extension on Feb 2-3. By Feb 5 (today), we are likely already seeing the residual tail.

Net directional adjustments:
- Slightly higher “Increases” than 5: because “more files expected” creates a non-trivial chance of another Tisch-specific mini-cycle before Feb 13.
- Slightly lower “Doesn’t change” than 73: because post-spike tails at low values (like ~5) can be jumpy (noise + small headlines) and because continued decay to 0–1 is plausible by day 8.
- Slightly higher “Decreases” than 22 (or roughly similar): because the natural drift from ~5 toward a baseline around ~2 (or even 0–1) is still the status-quo path if no new headlines occur after Super Bowl week.

Probability calibration
- My inside-view modal path remains “no major new Tisch-specific development; interest drifts down modestly but often stays within ±3.”
- Main uncertainty/blind spot is whether another tranche / investigative follow-up drops within Feb 6-12 that explicitly features Tisch (would push “Increases”).

Checklist:
1) Criteria/options: Compare Feb 13 vs Feb 5 on fixed Trends URL; ±3=No change; >+3 increase; <-3 decrease.
2) Outside view base rate used: [5, 73, 22].
3) Consistency: Most likely=Doesn’t change; least likely=Increases; aligns with “post-peak decay but some chance of new tranche.”
4) Key evidence (most significant):
   - Peak story broke Jan 31; now in tail phase (multiple major outlets).
   - NFL/Goodell “will look into it” already public Feb 2-3 (AP/ESPN/CNN).
   - “More files expected/partial release” raises chance of new mini-spike (NBC/CNN framing).
   - No clearly identified scheduled decisive event by Feb 13; absent that, decay dominates.
5) Blind spot: A fresh DOJ tranche or NFL/Giants action (sanction/resignation/sale pressure) landing Feb 6-12 could push Feb13 ≥ Feb5+4.
6) Technicalities: probabilities 0–100, sum to 100, ordered correctly.
