Analysis
(a) Source analysis  
1. Google Trends pull (5 Feb 2026). Hard data on daily U.S. “steve tisch” interest; value today ≈ 5 on the 0-100 scale, peak 31 Jan = 100. Highest-quality, objective, time-stamped.  
2. Cluster of mainstream reports (NY Times, CNN, CNBC, BBC, ABC, ESPN, AP, NBC, etc., 31 Jan-5 Feb). All cover the 30 Jan DOJ document dump linking Steve Tisch to Jeffrey Epstein and the NFL’s promise to “look into” the matter. Factual overlap high; little forward-looking content. Reputable outlets.  
3. AskNews batch (3-5 Feb). Mostly rewrites of the above plus Super Bowl-week press-conference quotes. No scheduled hearings, no further leaks announced. Moderate-quality but consistent.  
4. Entertainment item (Masters of the Universe toy reveal, 1-2 Feb). Minor publicity, unlikely to move searches.  

Opinion vs. fact: we rely only on reported events (document release, NFL statement, toy-line PR). Predictions or speculation by columnists are ignored.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Google Trends history: in the last 90 days 92 % of 8-day windows changed ≤3 points. (Weight: strong)  
• Scale lock (14 Jan-13 Feb) fixes 31 Jan as 100, making a second large spike harder. (strong)  

Moderate evidence  
• News burst already peaked 31 Jan-3 Feb; no fresh catalysts scheduled 5-13 Feb. Search attention normally decays after first wave. (moderate)  
• Super Bowl (9 Feb) keeps NFL in headlines but Giants are not playing; Tisch unlikely to be centre-stage. (moderate)  

Weak evidence  
• Possible surprise (league discipline, new tranche of documents) could reignite coverage. (weak)  
• Google rounding at low values can produce 0-point days, permitting a >3-point drop. (weak)

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window: 8 days (05 Feb–13 Feb 2026).  
If cut to 4 days, “Decrease” probability falls (less time for decay), “Increase” roughly unchanged.  
If doubled to 16 days, both tails rise; extra time increases chance of a new story or further fade.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Starting from the outside view 7 / 86 / 7 (Inc / No ch / Dec):

1. Down-drift momentum: after similar spikes, interest often slips from mid-single digits to 0-2 within a week. Adds ~+8 pp to “Decrease”, −8 pp to “Doesn’t change”.  
2. Lack of scheduled trigger: makes a fresh rise less likely than in the unconditional base. Shifts −1 pp from “Increase” to “Doesn’t change”.  
3. Super Bowl media availability: tiny chance Goodell is pressed again, bumping searches. Returns +4 pp to “Increase”, −2 pp each from “No change” and “Decrease”.  
4. Surprise factor (new leaks, NFL sanctions): assign small residual likelihood to another spike. +2 pp to “Increase”, −2 pp to “Doesn’t change”.

Net adjustment leads to:

Probability calibration
Increases .......... 10  
Doesn't change ..... 75  
Decreases .......... 15  

These sum to 100.

Checklist  
1. Options paraphrase: Compare 13 Feb Google Trends value with 5 Feb. >+3 → Increases; −3 < → Decreases; otherwise No change.  
2. Base rate: 7/86/7.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = Doesn’t change; least likely = Increase or Decrease? Decrease slightly more likely than Increase. Coherent.  
4. Key evidence: a) 90-day 92 % stability; b) post-spike decay pattern; c) no new events scheduled; d) Super Bowl may prompt brief mentions; e) scale-lock limits upside.  
5. Blind spot: NFL unexpectedly suspends Tisch this week, triggering another media wave and search spike. Would favour “Increase.”  
6. Probabilities numeric, sum 100.

Probabilities: [10, 75, 15]
