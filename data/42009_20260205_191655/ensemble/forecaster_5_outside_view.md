Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. GoogleTrendsData (5 Feb 2026 snapshot).  
   • Facts: Provides daily U.S. “interest over time” values for “steve tisch” over the last 30 and 90 days; the current value for 5 Feb 2026 is 5 on a 0-100 scale. Also gives frequency with which 8-day windows registered changes of >3 points (base-rate table).  
   • Quality: Direct quantitative data pulled from Google Trends, time-stamped today; objective and highly relevant. No opinions.  

2. News articles from Guardian, WSLS/AP, BBC, CNBC, CNN (31 Jan – 4 Feb 2026).  
   • Facts: All report on the 31 Jan document dump linking Steve Tisch to Jeffrey Epstein; NFL says it “will look into” the matter. No article projects any specific dated event between 5 Feb and 13 Feb.  
   • Opinions: Mostly journalistic framing; no expert forecasts about Google-search traffic.  
   • Quality: Reputable outlets with clear publication dates preceding the forecast window; credibility high for establishing past media attention but limited predictive value for search behaviour after 5 Feb.  

3. Agent_report (5 Feb 2026).  
   • Facts: Searches media schedules and finds no announced Tisch appearances, press conferences or scheduled NFL hearings during 5-13 Feb. Lists remaining information gaps.  
   • Quality: Derived from a systematic scan; some residual uncertainty, but useful for assessing likelihood of fresh news spikes.  

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. All Google-Trends 8-day windows for “steve tisch” (last 90 days).  
2. 8-day windows immediately *after* a one-day spike ≥100 for mid-tier public figures.  
3. 8-day windows for NFL owners’ names in the absence of scheduled events.  

Class 1 is data-rich, directly tied to the term, and already summarised (n≈80 windows). Class 2 would have higher variance but we lack systematic numbers. Class 3 is broader but idiosyncratic.  
→ Select Class 1 as the main outside-view baseline.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window length: 8 days (05 Feb–13 Feb 2026).  
Base-rate behaviour for “steve tisch”:  
• 92 % of past 8-day windows showed a net change ≤3 points (“Doesn’t change”).  
• 8 % showed an increase >3 points (none showed a decrease >3 points).  
The current value (5) sits well below the recent peak (31 Jan =100) but is still above the pre-spike floor (0-2). Over the 90-day sample, values clustered at 0-2 with occasional spikes; once a spike subsides, values tend to revert and stay flat. The historical chance of moving from a mid-single-digit value to ≤1 is non-zero but not observed in the small 90-day sample; Google’s integer rounding at low values makes downward moves rarer than upward moves, hence the 0 % empirical rate for “Decrease”.  

(d) Justification  
• Base data give ~9-to-1 odds in favour of “Doesn’t change” relative to “Increases”, with “Decreases” extremely rare.  
• All major media coverage of the Epstein files occurred 31 Jan – 4 Feb. No fresh hearings, press events, or scheduled revelations are documented for the 8-day forecast window, reducing the likelihood of another surge that would lift the 13 Feb value above 8 (5+3).  
• Because the scale is locked to 14 Jan–13 Feb in the resolution URL, the 100-point peak on 31 Jan is fixed. That leaves little headroom for additional large rises; a new flurry of searches would have to match or exceed earlier intensity merely to nudge the 13 Feb value above 8.  
• Downward movement requires the 13 Feb value to be 1 or 0. Historically, once interest has subsided to the 3-6 range it often oscillates by 1–2 points, so a fall of >3 points is possible but less common than a flat reading.  
• Expert/market expectation: None available; no betting or prediction-market quotes.  
Hence, the outside view is strongly concentrated on “Doesn’t change,” with a modest tail on “Increases” and a smaller tail on “Decreases.”

Outside view calibration:
• Begin with empirical frequencies: 8 % Increase, 0 % Decrease, 92 % No change.  
• Add a minimal probability mass to the never-yet-observed “Decrease” option to reflect uncertainty (Lindy correction, avoid zero). Reallocate proportionally from the other two.  
• Adjust slightly downward on “Increase” because a second spike within the same 30-day range is statistically rarer: deduct ~1 pp from “Increase,” assign it to “Doesn’t change.”  
Resulting calibrated probabilities: approximately 7 % Increase, 86 % Doesn’t change, 7 % Decrease.

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 7%  
Doesn't change: 86%  
Decreases: 7%
