You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “steve tisch” change between 2026-02-05 and 2026-02-13 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “steve tisch” at the time of writing this question (Feb 1, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 26; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=steve%20tisch&date=2026-01-02%202026-02-01).

`{"format":"trends_interest_change_magnitude","info":{"topic":"steve tisch","trend_start":"2026-02-05","trend_end":"2026-02-13","verification_url":"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=steve%20tisch&date=2026-01-14%202026-02-13"}}`

The options are: ['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves “Doesn't change” if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=steve%20tisch&date=2026-01-14%202026-02-13](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=steve%20tisch&date=2026-01-14%202026-02-13) for 2026-02-13 is within 3 of the value at 2026-02-05. It resolves “Increases” if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves “Decreases” if the value is more than 3 lower.

3. **No Criminal Charges**: Tisch has never been charged with any crime connected to the investigation into Epstein.

4. **Email Timeline**: The emails in question were sent in 2013.

5. **Email Content**: Messages show Epstein arranging for Tisch to meet various women, including:
   - May 2013: Epstein offering to connect Tisch with a Russian woman; Tisch replied asking "Is she fun?"
   - June 2013: Tisch asking about a woman from Tahiti, including whether she was a "working girl" (Epstein replied "Never")
   - Follow-up email about a Ukrainian woman with discussion of "age difference" and keeping her from returning to Ukraine

6. **Tisch's Age and Background**: Tisch is 76 years old, won an Academy Award in 1994 for producing Forrest Gump, and is chairman and executive vice president of the Giants. His involvement with the team began in 1991 when his father, Preston Tisch, bought 50% of the Giants from the Mara family.

8. **Epstein's Death**: Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in August 2019, a month after being indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.

## Official Statements:

**NFL Statement (Monday):**
"The league is aware of the reports and Steve's response. Our office will look into the matter to understand the facts."

**Steve Tisch Statement (Friday):**
"We had a brief association where we exchanged emails about adult women, and in addition, we discussed movies, philanthropy and investments. I did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island. As we all know now, he was a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with."

**NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell (Monday, Super Bowl week press conference):**
"We are going to look at all the facts. We are going to look at the context of those and try to understand that, we will look at how that falls under the policy. But let's get the facts first."

## Relevant Policy Information:

**NFL Personal Conduct Policy:** The NFL could punish Tisch under this policy even without evidence of criminal wrongdoing. The policy states: "Everyone who is part of the league must refrain from 'conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in' the NFL. It is not enough simply to avoid being found guilty of a crime in a court of law."

**Precedent**: In 2023, former Washington Commanders owner Daniel Snyder was fined $60 million after the league found he sexually harassed a team employee and oversaw executives who withheld revenue from other clubs.

This represents significant negative news coverage that could drive search interest in Steve Tisch during the forecasting window (February 5-13, 2026).

</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Are any significant NFL, entertainment, or philanthropic appearances scheduled for Steve Tisch between 5 and 13 February 2026? Focus on Super Bowl week media schedules, award-season press releases, and Giants organisational news.
A review of Super Bowl-week coverage (The Guardian 2 Feb 2026; Yahoo Sports 3 Feb 2026; New York Post 2 Feb 2026), all major national wire services (USA TODAY, ABC News, NBC Sports, PBS News) and industry publications (Sports Business Journal 5 Feb 2026) shows the NFL conversation around Steve Tisch from 31 January through 5 February 2026 to be dominated by the release of more than three million pages of Jeffrey Epstein files. 
•  Between 31 Jan and 5 Feb the league and Commissioner Roger Goodell repeatedly stated that “we’ll look at the facts” before deciding whether to open a formal investigation of Tisch’s emails with Epstein, but no timetable, hearing date or media availability involving Tisch himself was announced (Guardian 2 Feb 2026; Yahoo 3 Feb 2026; NY Post 2 Feb 2026; USA TODAY 2 Feb 2026).  
•  Goodell’s annual Super Bowl week news conference took place on Monday 2 Feb; Tisch was not on the podium and no appearance by him was listed in the daily pool schedule for Radio Row or for NFL owner availabilities published by the league’s communications office. The coverage contains no reference to a planned Tisch media stop later in the week.  
•  The only Tisch-related NFL item dated inside the query window (5-13 Feb) is Sports Business Journal’s 5 Feb summary of the e-mail controversy; again it references no forthcoming appearance, only that the league “could” discipline him (SBJ 5 Feb 2026).  

Entertainment-industry sources likewise show no public commitments for Tisch in the 5-13 February window.  
•  Academy-Awards releases of 22 Jan 2026 from The Hollywood Reporter and Deadline list 2026 Oscar nominees; Tisch is not attached to any nominated picture, nor is he mentioned as a planned presenter or campaign participant.  
•  Trade coverage of Tisch’s John Madden biopic (slated for later in 2026) notes the project but does not list press events or junkets in early February (USA TODAY 2 Feb 2026).  

Philanthropy-related searches turn up no gala invitations, fundraising dinners or board meetings involving Tisch for 5-13 Feb. The only philanthropic context appearing in coverage is a reference in Tisch’s own statement that his e-mail exchanges with Epstein also “discussed… philanthropy” (Guardian 2 Feb 2026), but no event is tied to that remark.  

Giants organisational news:  
•  The Giants’ hiring of head coach John Harbaugh was announced 17 Jan 2026 with a written quote from Tisch (Chattanooga Times Free Press 17 Jan 2026). There is no follow-up press conference scheduled for 5-13 Feb; by Super Bowl week the introductory availability had already occurred.  
•  No other Giants press releases dated 5-13 Feb mention Tisch.  

Conclusion:  
Based on all publicly available reporting up to and including 5 February 2026, there are NO confirmed or announced significant NFL, entertainment or philanthropic appearances for Steve Tisch between 5 and 13 February 2026. Coverage in that span is limited to secondary reporting on the Epstein e-mail revelations and the possibility—still unscheduled—of an NFL investigation.  

Remaining information gaps:  
•  The NFL’s daily credentialed-media schedule for 6-10 Feb (often circulated only to accredited outlets) is not publicly archived; theoretically, a closed-door owners’ session could still be added.  
•  The Giants’ internal calendar and local New York beat reports for charitable work are not captured in national outlets.  
•  Entertainment guild (PGA/DGA) event guest lists for the weekend of 8-9 Feb have not yet been published online.  

Absent those embargoed or unpublished documents, the current public record indicates that Steve Tisch has no scheduled appearances of note during the requested period.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
