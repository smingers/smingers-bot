Analysis:
The key to anticipating a Google-Trends jump is identifying whether Steve Tisch is likely to appear in prominent headlines, broadcasts, or social-media conversations during the next eight days. Relevant triggers include:
• NFL events (e.g., Super Bowl LX media week, Hall-of-Fame announcements, ownership meetings, or any New York Giants developments).  
• Entertainment events (Tisch is an Oscar-winning producer; award nominations, film releases, or industry deals could surface).  
• Personal/legal news (philanthropy, lawsuits, health issues, political donations, etc.).  

Therefore, searches should look for (a) scheduled or rumored NFL or film-industry events tied to Tisch, and (b) any fresh or breaking stories in mainstream news that might continue to snowball through Feb 13.
