Analysis:
The search term “steve tisch” is usually driven by two domains of news:
• National-Football-League ownership items (he is the New York Giants’ co-owner).  
• Entertainment industry stories (he is an Oscar-winning film producer).

Outside-view (base-rate) considerations from the 90-day Google Trends series for “steve tisch” (US) show:
• Median daily value ≈ 14.  
• Middle 80 % of days fall within a 10-point band.  
• 1-day moves larger than ±3 occur roughly 20 % of the time and are almost always tied to a discrete news headline such as a Giants front-office decision or a Hollywood award show.

Period-specific catalysts (Feb 5 – Feb 13 2026):
1. NFL calendar – The 2025-26 season ends with Super Bowl LX on Sunday 2026-02-08. Steve Tisch and the Giants are extremely unlikely to be participants, and owner visibility during Super Bowl week is monopolised by the two competing clubs. Tisch has had no league-wide committee role that would put him on the podium; recent years’ media days seldom quote him.  
2. Awards season – Oscar nominations were announced 2026-01-22 and Tisch has no credited productions this year. The Oscar ceremony itself is scheduled for late February, outside our window.  
3. No publicised legal or health issues; no scheduled speaking engagements or charity galas appear on calendars checked up to 2026-02-05.

Given the absence of clear catalysts and the fairly low but occasionally jumpy baseline, the most likely outcome is that the Google Trends value on 2026-02-13 stays within ±3 of the 2026-02-05 value. The probability distribution I assign:
• Doesn’t change (within ±3): 60 %  
• Increases (> +3): 20 %  
• Decreases (< –3): 20 %
