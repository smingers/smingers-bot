Tisch, executive vice president of the New York Giants and a member of the team's ownership group since 2005, was named at least 440 times in the recently released U.S. Justice Department documents tied to Epstein, a convicted child sex offender. The files include correspondence suggesting ties between Tisch and Epstein, raising concerns given Epstein\u2019s association with Ghislaine Maxwell, who was convicted of sex trafficking in 2021. Goodell stated, 'Absolutely we will look at all the facts,' and emphasized the need to understand the context of the exchanges. While Tisch has led the Giants to two Super Bowl victories (2007, 2011) alongside the Mara family, his position as chairman of the Giants\u2019 board may be at risk due to the serious nature of the allegations. The NFL has precedent for holding owners accountable\u2014most notably, Daniel Snyder of the Washington Commanders was pressured to sell his team in 2023 amid allegations of a hostile work environment and sexual harassment. Despite public calls for accountability, Goodell declined to comment on potential punishment, saying, 'I think we'll take one step at a time.

The author attributes this shift to several factors: players' increased visibility through social media and podcasts, reducing their mystique; the neutralization of player voices due to brand partnerships; a shrinking media landscape, including layoffs and potential closure of major sports departments like the Washington Post\u2019s; the NFL\u2019s perceived lack of substantive content; and the unchanging, scripted nature of NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell, who avoided addressing whether the league would investigate Giants co-owner Steve Tisch\u2019s past communications with Jeffrey Epstein, instead stating only that the league would 'look at all the facts.' The author notes that the NBA trade deadline, particularly rumors involving Giannis Antetokounmpo and James Harden, has become more compelling than Super Bowl Opening Night.

The documents, which included 2,000 videos, 180,000 images, and thousands of redacted and unredacted records, revealed correspondence from 2013 between Tisch and Epstein. Emails show Epstein provided 'scouting reports' on multiple women to an account linked to Tisch, who asked whether women were 'pros,' 'working girls,' or 'civilians.' One email reads, 'Curious about (redacted). I will contact (redacted). pro or civilian?' Another states, 'send me a number to call I don't like records of these conversations.' The emails also include Tisch inviting Epstein to join him in a Giants game suite and proposing meetings for walks and lunches in New York. Tisch later issued a statement expressing regret over his 'brief association' with Epstein, clarifying he never accepted invitations, did not visit Epstein\u2019s island, and described Epstein as 'a terrible person.' The NFL confirmed awareness of the reports and Tisch\u2019s response, stating, 'Our office will look into the matter to understand the facts.' Tisch, a 76-year-old film producer and co-owner of the Giants since 2005, has been involved in producing hit films such as 'Forrest Gump' and 'Risky Business,' with a John Madden biopic starring Nicolas Cage scheduled for release in 2026.

Tisch\u2019s name appears at least 440 times in the documents, with most correspondence occurring around 2013. In a statement, Tisch acknowledged a brief email exchange with Epstein about adult women, movies, philanthropy, and investments, stating he never accepted Epstein\u2019s invitations and never visited his island. He expressed deep regret for the association, calling Epstein 'a terrible person.' The NFL emphasized that its personal conduct policy holds owners to a higher standard, requiring behavior that upholds the league\u2019s integrity, even if no criminal activity is proven. The league has previously fined owners for misconduct, including Jerry Richardson ($2.75 million) and Dan Snyder ($60 million). Tisch, 76, is chairman, co-owner, and vice president of the Giants and a film producer known for 'Forrest Gump' and 'Risky Business.' Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial, was charged with sex trafficking and served 13 months in prison after a 2008 conviction for soliciting a minor for prostitution. He operated a sex-trafficking ring on Little St. James Island, which he purchased in 1998 for nearly $8 million.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 09:51 PM\nSource:[ESPN.com](https://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/47809616/nfl-look-giants-co-owner-tisch-epstein-files-connection)\n\n**MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE Action Figures Reveal Better Look At A Monstrous Villain From The '80s Cartoon**\nThe upcoming live-action reboot of 'Masters of the Universe' has revealed new action figures featuring He-Man (Nicholas Galitzine), Teela (Camila Mendes), and Beast Man, one of the original 1980s cartoon's most notorious villains. The figures, showcased through social media posts on January 22, 2026, and February 1, 2026, include new artwork and photos of a Castle Grayskull 3D model kit. The character Beast Man was previously speculated to be the actor in a motion-capture suit seen chasing Galitzine and Mendes during filming in London in summer 2025, and his appearance was further confirmed in a recent trailer where he is seen leaping onto a car. The film\u2019s cast also includes Sam C. Wilson as Trap Jaw, Kojo Attah as Tri-Klops, Jon Xue Zhang as Ram-Man, and Kristin Wiig voicing Roboto. The project, previously developed by Netflix in 2022, was reportedly abandoned earlier in 2026. The story centers on Prince Adam, a 10-year-old who crash-landed on Earth in a spaceship and lost his Power Sword, only to reclaim it nearly two decades later and return to Eternia to battle Skeletor. The film will be produced by Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal, Steve Tisch, and DeVon Franklin.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 07:02 PM\nSource:[sffgazette.com](https://sffgazette.com/fantasy/movies/masters-of-the-universe-action-figures-reveal-better-look-at-a-monstrous-villain-from-the-80s-cartoon-a9638)\n\n**Russell Wilson Speaks Out After His Name Appears in Epstein Files: 'Not TODAY Satan!'**\nRussell Wilson denied any connection to disgraced financier Jeffrey Epstein following the release of over 3 million pages of documents by the Department of Justice on February 1, 2026. Wilson, 37, posted on X (formerly Twitter), stating, 'NOPE!!! ABSOLUTELY NOT! Not TODAY satan!' He explained that he had only expressed interest in purchasing a Gulfstream G-IV jet from a broker in January 2019, with no knowledge of the plane\u2019s owner, and never met or spoke with Epstein. Wilson clarified he was concerned about media attention affecting his contract negotiations with the Seattle Seahawks at the time. A January 2019 email from pilot Larry Visosk explained Wilson\u2019s interest in the plane and his desire to delay the purchase until after signing his contract, noting he took photos and videos with his then-partner, singer Ciara. Wilson is not the only athlete linked to Epstein; the documents also reveal email exchanges between Epstein and Steve Tisch, co-owner of the New York Giants, in 2013, where Epstein offered to arrange meetings with women. Tisch responded, 'Is she fun?' The Giants issued a statement on Tisch\u2019s behalf, acknowledging a brief email exchange about adult women, movies, philanthropy, and investments, but emphasized that Tisch never accepted any invitations and never visited Epstein\u2019s island, calling Epstein 'a terrible person' and expressing deep regret over the association.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 06:22 PM\nSource:[PEOPLE.com](https://people.com/russell-wilson-speaks-out-after-name-appears-epstein-files-11897520)\n\n**NFL remains quiet on Steve Tisch's Jeffrey Epstein connection**\nThe NFL has remained silent on the revelation that Giants co-owner Steve Tisch was in communication with Jeffrey Epstein, as disclosed in the Friday 2026 release of Epstein's emails and documents. Despite two separate inquiries from NBC Sports, the league provided no comment. Tisch issued a statement on Friday night, acknowledging a brief association involving emails about adult women, movies, philanthropy, and investments, and stating he did not accept any invitations to Epstein\u2019s island. He expressed regret over the association, calling Epstein 'a terrible person.' Critics, including Ian O'Connor of The Athletic, have called for Tisch to be fined, suspended, or barred from team and league activities, citing precedent such as Jerry Richardson selling the Panthers and Daniel Snyder being forced to sell the Commanders due to misconduct. The NFL\u2019s Personal Conduct Policy previously stated that ownership would be held to a higher standard, but in 2023, that language was removed from the owner-specific version, though retained in the broader policy. This change followed scrutiny over perceived double standards, particularly after Deshaun Watson highlighted the disparity in treatment between players and owners. Jerry Jones, owner of the Cowboys, dismissed comparisons as misleading, arguing that player and non-player cases involve vastly different circumstances. With the Super Bowl press conference approaching, the NFL faces mounting pressure to respond to the Tisch-Epstein connection, as ignoring the issue will no longer be feasible.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 03:24 PM\nSource:[NBC Sports](https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/nfl-remains-quiet-on-steve-tischs-jeffrey-epstein-connection)\n\n**MASTERS OF THE UNIVERSE: First Look At New Action Figure Line Spotlights Beast Man Design**\nThe upcoming live-action reboot of 'Masters of the Universe' has unveiled new action figure packaging showcasing He-Man (portrayed by Nicholas Galitzine), Teela (portrayed by Camila Mendes), and the monstrous Beast Man. Footage from the film's London shoot in summer 2025 showed an actor in a large motion-capture suit chasing Galitzine and Mendes, fueling speculation that the character was Beast Man. This was further supported by a brief appearance of Beast Man jumping onto a car in the film's recent trailer. The movie, produced by Todd Black, Jason Blumenthal, Steve Tisch, and DeVon Franklin, follows the story of Prince Adam, a 10-year-old who crash-landed on Earth in a spaceship and was separated from his magical Power Sword\u2014his only connection to his home planet, Eternia. Nearly two decades later, after reuniting with the sword, Prince Adam is transported back to Eternia to defend it against the evil forces of Skeletor.

Tisch inquired about whether women were 'pro or civilian' or 'working girls,' with Epstein confirming one woman was a 'civilian, but Russian' and another was 'never' a 'working girl.' Epstein also described a Ukrainian woman as 'a little freaked by the age difference' and noted he would 'try to convince her not to return' to her home country. A microbiology student in Florida was described by Epstein as interested in meeting Tisch, with advice to 'make it clear that you will organize her ticket.' One woman confirmed she had 'googled Steve Tisch' and noted his status as an 'Oscar winner producer, and Giants owner' before agreeing to a meeting. The men communicated about invitations to Epstein\u2019s home and sports events, including Tisch offering 'two tickets in my Suite for Sundays game' and Epstein referring to Tisch as a 'new but obviously shared interest friend.' Tisch has not been charged with any wrongdoing. In a statement to ABC News, Tisch said he had a 'brief association' with Epstein, discussing 'movies, philanthropy and investments,' and emphasized he 'did not take him up on any of his invitations and never went to his island,' adding he 'deeply regret[ted] associating with' Epstein, whom he called a 'terrible person.'

The emails, primarily from 2013 (five years after Epstein\u2019s 2008 conviction for procuring a child for prostitution) and one from 2017, include discussions about arranging meetings with women, some of whom Epstein described using terms like 'tahitian,' 'exotic,' and 'russian.' Tisch asked if one woman was a 'working girl,' and inquired about potential 'trouble' during a visit to Epstein\u2019s home. Epstein responded with suggestive details about the women\u2019s backgrounds and availability, including a request to avoid recorded conversations. Tisch also expressed interest in meeting a woman Epstein described as 'sweet as she seems' and 'fun,' and confirmed he never visited Epstein\u2019s Caribbean island. The emails also reference Tisch inviting Epstein to a Giants game and Epstein offering to bring 'the russian' to a meeting. Tisch, who is the son of Preston Robert Tisch and a Hollywood producer known for 'Risky Business,' 'Forrest Gump,' and 'American History X,' has been associated with 440 email results in the Epstein Library, though many are duplicates.

The correspondence includes Epstein introducing women to Tisch, discussing potential meetings, and arranging invitations to events, including a Giants game in Tisch\u2019s VIP suite and a trip to Epstein\u2019s private island in the Caribbean\u2014though Tisch stated he never accepted the latter.

According to reporting by The Athletic, Epstein sent Tisch messages containing 'scouting reports' on women, using terms such as 'pro or civilian' and 'working girl.' Some of the women referenced in the emails later wrote about encounters with Tisch, though no criminal charges were alleged against him. The release of over three million Epstein-related documents triggered immediate public backlash, with widespread calls for Tisch to resign and sell his ownership stake in the Giants. Neither Tisch nor the Giants issued an official statement, and the NFL has remained publicly silent, consistent with its standard approach to ownership matters. Tisch, who inherited his stake after his father Preston Tisch\u2019s death in 2005, has served as a key executive for nearly two decades and was instrumental during the Giants\u2019 two Super Bowl victories (2007, 2011). The controversy adds significant off-field pressure during a rebuilding phase for the franchise, as scrutiny over executive conduct intensifies across the league. Any ownership change would require NFL bylaw review and approval by fellow owners. The situation remains unresolved, with further reporting expected as the documents are analyzed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 01:49 AM\nSource:[MARCA](https://www.marca.com/en/nfl/new-york-giants/2026/01/31/697d5fa3e2704e472d8b45ac.html)\n\n**Epstein files released: Emails expose how Jeffrey Epstein connected Steve Tisch with young women in 2013**\nA newly released batch of documents from the Jeffrey Epstein Files, made public by the U.S. Department of Justice on January 31, 2026, reveals direct email communications between convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein and New York Giants co-owner and chairman Steve Tisch in 2013. The emails, part of over three million Epstein-related documents, show Epstein acting as a mediator who facilitated introductions between Tisch and multiple women, providing detailed and often explicit descriptions of their appearances, personalities, and backgrounds. Epstein used terms such as 'pro,' 'civilian,' and 'working girl' in these exchanges. Tisch responded to multiple messages, asking questions like 'Is she fun?' and 'Is my present in NYC?', and confirmed interest in women by asking whether they were 'pro or civilian.' Epstein confirmed one woman was a 'civilian' and noted she was 'a little freaked by the age difference,' advising Tisch to 'go slow.'

Murders fell by 77 victims (from 382 to 305), robberies dropped 10%, burglaries declined 4%, car thefts fell 5%, and subway crime decreased by 4%\u2014the lowest level since 2009. Shoplifting and retail theft dropped 14%, with at least half of incidents resulting in arrests due to re-synchronized resources across police units. Tisch attributed the decline in gun violence to the NYPD\u2019s current crime-fighting strategy, including precision policing, and defended the gang database as instrumental in preventing retaliatory violence and enabling successful takedowns. However, Mayor Mamdani, who campaigned on reforming policing by abolishing the Strategic Response Group, eliminating the gang database, and creating a $1 billion Department of Community Safety to handle mental health calls, did not address how these policies would align with Tisch\u2019s approach. He emphasized that the new agency would supplement, not supplant, NYPD work, and affirmed that the city\u2019s crime reduction achievements are 'numbers and accomplishments to be celebrated and built on.' Tisch noted a 16% rise in rape reports, attributed to a broader legal definition of rape in New York State enacted in 2024, with 25% of cases involving domestic violence. While violent assaults increased slightly (less than 1%), this was driven by a rise in assaults on law enforcement and domestic attacks. Tisch highlighted that 14% of shooting victims in 2025 were under 18\u2014a 5% increase from the prior year\u2014and pledged an 'all of city' and 'all of state' strategy to protect youth. Despite national trends showing a 14% drop in shootings by September 2025 and a 30% decline since 2021, Tisch pointed out that Chicago (1,400 shootings) and Philadelphia (825 shootings) had higher totals than New York despite smaller populations. Mamdani avoided directly challenging Tisch\u2019s policies, stating simply, 'We're not returning to broken windows policing,' when questioned about precision policing\u2019s racial equity concerns.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 06, 2026 09:53 PM\nSource:[Daily News](https://www.nydailynews.com/2026/01/06/as-mamdani-and-tisch-tout-drops-in-nyc-crime-unclear-how-their-policy-differences-will-play-out/)\n\n**What Austria Gooogled in 2025: From Graz Tragedy to Viral Elch Emil**\nGoogle released its 'Year in Search 2025' report for Austria, highlighting the most-searched topics based on the highest percentage growth in search volume.

The event features ten award-winning short films from the festival\u2019s history and an exclusive panel discussion with Laurie M. Tisch, actor John Turturro, Cal Hedigan, and young filmmakers Kendra Brown, Denise Chan, and Morgan Smartt. The initiative, launched in 2015 by Community Access, empowers youth aged 15\u201325 to use film to confront mental health challenges such as anxiety, depression, identity, and recovery, emphasizing that every lived experience holds value and healing is possible when voices are heard. According to former U.S. Surgeon General Vivek Murthy, MD, mental health is the defining public health crisis of our time, with 1 in 3 young adults in the U.S. experiencing mental health concerns and 3.8 million reporting serious suicidal thoughts. By streaming the films on major platforms, Changing Minds aims to broaden access, reduce stigma, and foster empathy. Cal Hedigan, CEO of Community Access, stated that the project remains youth-led and aims to spark meaningful dialogue. Laurie Tisch, founder of the Laurie M. Tisch Illumination Fund, emphasized that storytelling by young creators fosters empathy and validates youth perspectives. The Pixley Hill Foundation praised the initiative for challenging stigma and opening essential conversations. The Isora Foundation, a family foundation based in Albuquerque, New Mexico, supports projects using diverse media to share stories related to mental health, particularly those addressing stigmatization. Community Access, founded in 1974, provides supportive housing and person-centered services in New York City for individuals with mental health concerns. The Laurie M.
