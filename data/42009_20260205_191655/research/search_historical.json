His involvement with the team began in 1991 when his father, Preston Tisch, bought 50% of the Giants from the Mara family.\n\n7. **Document Release**: The documents were disclosed under the Epstein Files Transparency Act.\n\n8. **Epstein's Death**: Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in August 2019, a month after being indicted on federal sex trafficking charges.\n\n## Official Statements:\n\n**NFL Statement (Monday):**\n\"The league is aware of the reports and Steve's response.

We are going to look at the context of those and try to understand that, we will look at how that falls under the policy. But let's get the facts first.\"\n\n## Relevant Policy Information:\n\n**NFL Personal Conduct Policy:** The NFL could punish Tisch under this policy even without evidence of criminal wrongdoing. The policy states: \"Everyone who is part of the league must refrain from 'conduct detrimental to the integrity of and public confidence in' the NFL. It is not enough simply to avoid being found guilty of a crime in a court of law.\"\n\n**Precedent**: In 2023, former Washington Commanders owner Daniel Snyder was fined $60 million after the league found he sexually harassed a team employee and oversaw executives who withheld revenue from other clubs.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.wsls.com/sports/2026/02/02/nfl-commissioner-roger-goodell-says-expanding-the-regular-season-to-18-games-is-not-a-given/\">\n# Summary of Article\n\n**Source:** WSLS  \n**Date:** February 2, 2026  \n**Author:** Rob Maaddi, Associated Press\n\n## Key Facts and Statements:\n\n### Main Topic - 18-Game NFL Season:\n- NFL Commissioner Roger Goodell stated at his annual state of the NFL news conference (Monday, Feb. 2, 2026, in San Jose, Calif.) that expanding the regular season to 18 games is \"not a given\"\n- Goodell said there have been \"no formal discussions\" and \"very little, if any, informal conversations\" about the 18-game season\n- This contradicts statements made by Patriots owner Robert Kraft last Tuesday (Jan. 27, 2026), who made it seem 18 games was inevitable\n- Kraft stated: \"Every team will go to 18 (regular-season games) and two (preseason games) and eliminate one of the preseason games\"\n- The current CBA between the NFL and NFLPA expires in 2030\n- The NFL added a 17th game in 2021 in the most recent CBA\n- Seattle Seahawks receiver Cooper Kupp suggested Monday night that owners would have to give up \"a bigger piece of the financial pie\" for an 18th game to happen\n\n### Steve Tisch Investigation:\n- **The NFL will investigate New York Giants co-owner Steve Tisch and his association with Jeffrey Epstein**\n- Tisch's name appeared \"more than 400 times in files released by the U.S. Justice Department regarding Epstein\"\n- Goodell stated: \"Absolutely we will look at all the facts.

The article specifically names **Steve Tisch** as a prominent figure in newly released Epstein files, with potentially controversial email exchanges and an NFL investigation being considered. This represents significant negative news coverage that could drive search interest in Steve Tisch during the forecasting window (February 5-13, 2026).\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/31/epstein-files-trump-howard-lutnick-steve-tisch.html\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Epstein files: Trump, Howard Lutnick, Steve Tisch among prominent names that appear in latest Justice Department release\"\n\n**Source:** CNBC  \n**Date:** January 31, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- The Justice Department released more than 3 million pages of documents, over 2,000 videos, and 180,000 images related to Jeffrey Epstein on Friday (January 31, 2026)\n- This was a continuation of disclosures under the Epstein Files Transparency Act, following an initial release in December\n- Congressional Democrats claim Friday's release represents only about half of the collected files\n- The FBI began investigating Epstein in July 2006, with agents expecting an indictment by May 2007\n\n## Information Specifically About Steve Tisch:\n\n- Steve Tisch is identified as the co-owner of the New York Giants football team\n- Tisch exchanged emails with Epstein several times in 2013, some of which referenced women\n- In one exchange, Tisch asked Epstein about a woman he had lunch with, describing her as a \"very sweet girl\"\n- In another email, Tisch asked Epstein, \"Is there somebody in NY you want me to meet?\"\n- The emails included language that appeared to characterize women, with phrases like \"Working girl?\" and \"pro or civilian?\"\n- Epstein wrote to Tisch: \"I am happy to have you as a new but obviosly shared interest friend\"\n\n**Statement from Steve Tisch (via emailed statement):**\n- Said he had a \"brief association\" with Epstein where they emailed about \"adult women\" and other topics\n- Stated he never took Epstein up on invitations or visited his island\n- Called Epstein \"a terrible person and someone I deeply regret associating with\"\n\n## Other Prominent Names Mentioned:\n\n- Casey Wasserman (head of LA Olympics organizing committee) - emails with Ghislaine Maxwell from 2003\n- Miroslav Lajcak (Slovakia national security adviser) - resigned following disclosure of Epstein contact\n- Various Trump-related references and documents\n\n## Background on Epstein Case:\n\n- Epstein killed himself in a New York jail cell in August 2019, one month after federal sex trafficking indictment\n- Alexander Acosta (Trump's first labor secretary) signed off on a 2007-2008 deal allowing Epstein to avoid federal prosecution, resulting in an 18-month jail sentence on state charges\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/02/new-jeffrey-epstein-files-key-takeaways\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Newly released Jeffrey Epstein files: 10 key takeaways so far\"\n\n**Source:** The Guardian  \n**Date:** February 02, 2026  \n**Author:** Anna Betts\n\n## Key Facts and Findings:\n\n**Document Release:**\n- Approximately 3 million files related to Jeffrey Epstein were released on Friday (presumed January 31 or February 1, 2026)\n- Release follows legislation passed in November by US lawmakers mandating disclosure of all Epstein-related documents\n\n**Epstein's Potential Cooperation:**\n- Less than two weeks before Epstein died in jail in 2019, his attorneys met with Manhattan federal prosecutors on July 29, 2019\n- They discussed \"in very general terms\" the possibility of case resolution and Epstein's potential cooperation\n- Defense counsel did not make a specific proposal or indicate what cooperation might entail\n\n**Trump-Related Tips:**\n- FBI compiled a summary of more than a dozen tips received involving Trump and Epstein\n- Document includes unsubstantiated claims of sexual abuse\n- No corroborating evidence or indication that tips were verified\n- Trump has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing\n- Justice Department statement (Friday): documents \"may include fake or falsely submitted images, documents or videos\" and called claims against Trump \"unfounded and false\"\n\n**Other Named Individuals:**\n- **Elon Musk:** Emails show cordial exchanges with Epstein; plans made in 2012 and 2013 for Musk to visit Epstein's private island (trips did not occur due to logistical issues)\n- **Howard Lutnick** (US Secretary of Commerce): Files show he arranged to visit Epstein's island in 2012\n- **Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor:** Emails suggest he invited Epstein to Buckingham Palace following Epstein's release from house arrest in 2010; documents show Epstein offered to arrange dinner with a Russian woman\n- **Richard Branson:** 2013 email to Epstein stating \"would love to see you.

Focus on Super Bowl week media schedules, award-season press releases, and Giants organisational news.\nA review of Super Bowl-week coverage (The Guardian 2 Feb 2026; Yahoo Sports 3 Feb 2026; New York Post 2 Feb 2026), all major national wire services (USA TODAY, ABC News, NBC Sports, PBS News) and industry publications (Sports Business Journal 5 Feb 2026) shows the NFL conversation around Steve Tisch from 31 January through 5 February 2026 to be dominated by the release of more than three million pages of Jeffrey Epstein files. \n\u2022  Between 31 Jan and 5 Feb the league and Commissioner Roger Goodell repeatedly stated that \u201cwe\u2019ll look at the facts\u201d before deciding whether to open a formal investigation of Tisch\u2019s emails with Epstein, but no timetable, hearing date or media availability involving Tisch himself was announced (Guardian 2 Feb 2026; Yahoo 3 Feb 2026; NY Post 2 Feb 2026; USA TODAY 2 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022  Goodell\u2019s annual Super Bowl week news conference took place on Monday 2 Feb; Tisch was not on the podium and no appearance by him was listed in the daily pool schedule for Radio Row or for NFL owner availabilities published by the league\u2019s communications office. The coverage contains no reference to a planned Tisch media stop later in the week.  \n\u2022  The only Tisch-related NFL item dated inside the query window (5-13 Feb) is Sports Business Journal\u2019s 5 Feb summary of the e-mail controversy; again it references no forthcoming appearance, only that the league \u201ccould\u201d discipline him (SBJ 5 Feb 2026).  \n\nEntertainment-industry sources likewise show no public commitments for Tisch in the 5-13 February window.  \n\u2022  Academy-Awards releases of 22 Jan 2026 from The Hollywood Reporter and Deadline list 2026 Oscar nominees; Tisch is not attached to any nominated picture, nor is he mentioned as a planned presenter or campaign participant.  \n\u2022  Trade coverage of Tisch\u2019s John Madden biopic (slated for later in 2026) notes the project but does not list press events or junkets in early February (USA TODAY 2 Feb 2026).  \n\nPhilanthropy-related searches turn up no gala invitations, fundraising dinners or board meetings involving Tisch for 5-13 Feb. The only philanthropic context appearing in coverage is a reference in Tisch\u2019s own statement that his e-mail exchanges with Epstein also \u201cdiscussed\u2026 philanthropy\u201d (Guardian 2 Feb 2026), but no event is tied to that remark.  \n\nGiants organisational news:  \n\u2022  The Giants\u2019 hiring of head coach John Harbaugh was announced 17 Jan 2026 with a written quote from Tisch (Chattanooga Times Free Press 17 Jan 2026). There is no follow-up press conference scheduled for 5-13 Feb; by Super Bowl week the introductory availability had already occurred.  \n\u2022  No other Giants press releases dated 5-13 Feb mention Tisch.  \n\nConclusion:  \nBased on all publicly available reporting up to and including 5 February 2026, there are NO confirmed or announced significant NFL, entertainment or philanthropic appearances for Steve Tisch between 5 and 13 February 2026. Coverage in that span is limited to secondary reporting on the Epstein e-mail revelations and the possibility\u2014still unscheduled\u2014of an NFL investigation.  \n\nRemaining information gaps:  \n\u2022  The NFL\u2019s daily credentialed-media schedule for 6-10 Feb (often circulated only to accredited outlets) is not publicly archived; theoretically, a closed-door owners\u2019 session could still be added.  \n\u2022  The Giants\u2019 internal calendar and local New York beat reports for charitable work are not captured in national outlets.  \n\u2022  Entertainment guild (PGA/DGA) event guest lists for the weekend of 8-9 Feb have not yet been published online.  \n\nAbsent those embargoed or unpublished documents, the current public record indicates that Steve Tisch has no scheduled appearances of note during the requested period.</Agent_report>\n\n<GoogleTrendsData term=\"steve tisch\">\nGoogle Trends US data for \"steve tisch\" (last 90 days):\n\nCurrent value: 5\n90-day mean: 2.2\n90-day std dev: 11.2\n\nBASE RATE ANALYSIS (using 8-day windows to match question timeframe):\n- In 92% of 8-day windows, the value changed by \u22643 points (\"Doesn't change\")\n- In 8% of 8-day windows, the value INCREASED by >3 points\n- In 0% of 8-day windows, the value DECREASED by >3 points\n\nRecent trend: increasing (last 7 days avg: 27.6 vs prior 7 days: 0.0)\n\nDAILY VALUES (last 30 days):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-07,0\n2026-01-08,0\n2026-01-09,0\n2026-01-10,0\n2026-01-11,0\n2026-01-12,0\n2026-01-13,0\n2026-01-14,1\n2026-01-15,2\n2026-01-16,1\n2026-01-17,1\n2026-01-18,0\n2026-01-19,0\n2026-01-20,0\n2026-01-21,1\n2026-01-22,0\n2026-01-23,0\n2026-01-24,0\n2026-01-25,0\n2026-01-26,0\n2026-01-27,0\n2026-01-28,0\n2026-01-29,0\n2026-01-30,21\n2026-01-31,100\n2026-02-01,24\n2026-02-02,19\n2026-02-03,19\n2026-02-04,5\n2026-02-05,5\n\nNote: Google Trends values are relative (0-100 scale), not absolute search volumes.\n</GoogleTrendsData>\n"
