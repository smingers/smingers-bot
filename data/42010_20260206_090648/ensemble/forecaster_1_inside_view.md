**Euronews Article (February 2, 2026):**
- Discusses Novo Nordisk/Ozempic as potential Danish leverage
- Experts conclude Denmark has limited leverage via pharmaceutical restrictions
- Relevance: Low for sovereignty question, more about negotiating dynamics

**AskNews Articles Summary:**
- **Poll (February 4, 2026):** 76% of Greenlanders reject becoming part of US; only 8% support
- **Multiple articles confirm:** Greenland PM Nielsen warns Trump "still wants to control" but sovereignty remains red line
- **Key pattern:** All parties (Greenland, Denmark, NATO allies) consistently reject sovereignty transfer while discussing military/security cooperation
- **Trump statements:** Claimed negotiations begun and "pretty well agreed to" but details remain vague
- **Manifold Markets:** 18% probability for US sovereignty by end of 2026

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (against prediction increase):**
1. **Universal rejection of sovereignty transfer** - Multiple independent sources (Greenland PM, Danish PM, Danish FM, EU leaders) all explicitly state sovereignty is non-negotiable. This is structural/institutional resistance.
2. **Trump's rhetorical shift** - From sovereignty claims to "military access" and "framework deal" language. Even Trump's own statements have moderated from acquisition to cooperation.
3. **15-day stability period** - Prediction has held at 10.00% since January 22 news cycle, suggesting forecaster consensus post-information processing.

**Moderate Evidence (against increase):**
1. **Poll data** - 76% of Greenlanders oppose US integration; only 8% support. This creates political impossibility for sovereignty transfer.
2. **Legal obstacles** - Constitutional ban on land sales in Greenland; expert legal opinion that sovereign bases would violate international law.
3. **NATO dynamics** - Framework discussions explicitly about security cooperation, not sovereignty. NATO spokeswoman confirms sovereignty "did not come up" in Trump-Rutte talks.

**Weak Evidence (for potential increase):**
1. **Trump unpredictability** - Could make dramatic statement in 8-day window
2. **Manifold Markets** - Shows 18% for 2026, suggesting some crowd wisdom sees higher probability
3. **Vague "framework" claims** - Could be reinterpreted or expanded in news cycle

**Critical Distinction:** All recent developments involve military access/cooperation, NOT formal sovereignty transfer. The resolution criteria requires "formal sovereignty over any part of Greenland" - a much higher bar than military base agreements.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 8 days (February 6-14, 2026)

**Current Status:** Community prediction at exactly 10.00% as of February 1, has remained stable for 5+ days

**If timeframe halved (4 days):** Would predict ~20-22% chance of exceeding 10.00% - less time for news emergence, stronger status quo bias

**If timeframe doubled (16 days):** Would predict ~35-40% chance - more opportunity for Trump statement or news development, but also more time for prediction to drift or stabilize further

**Key consideration:** The underlying question resolves end of 2026 (11 months away). The 10.00% prediction already seems generous given universal rejection of sovereignty transfer and distinction between military access (negotiable) vs. sovereignty (non-negotiable).

## (d) Justification

**Base rate from outside view:** 27%

**Factors supporting lower probability:**

1. **Structural impossibility:** The resolution criteria requires "formal sovereignty" - either US statute declaring 1%+ of Greenland under US sovereignty, OR binding agreement granting sovereignty. Every identifiable source (Greenland PM, Danish PM, Danish FM, EU leaders) explicitly rejects this. This is not negotiating posture - it's constitutional/legal reality.

2. **Information already processed:** The major news events (Jan 7 escalation, Jan 22 framework announcement) occurred 30 and 15 days ago respectively. Metaculus forecasters are sophisticated and have had time to digest. The 10.00% represents post-spike equilibrium.

3. **Semantic distinction matters:** Trump's "framework" involves military cooperation, not sovereignty. The BBC article explicitly notes diplomatic sources said "no agreement for American control or ownership." Forecasters understand this distinction.

4. **Poll data reinforces impossibility:** 76% Greenlandic opposition creates political impossibility for sovereignty transfer, even if legal mechanisms existed.

5. **8-day window is short:** For prediction to rise meaningfully requires new dramatic news specifically about sovereignty (not just military access), which has low probability given current trajectory toward security cooperation framework.

**Factors supporting higher probability:**

1. **Threshold effect:** Prediction only needs to exceed 10.00% (even 10.01% counts). Small upticks are easier than large moves.

2. **Trump factor:** Unpredictable statements possible, though recent pattern shows moderation not escalation.

3. **Metaculus dynamics:** Community predictions can show volatility even near resolution dates if dramatic news emerges.

**Calibration:** The outside view 27% seems too high given:
- The strong structural evidence against sovereignty transfer
- The clear distinction between military access (being negotiated) and sovereignty (universally rejected)
- The 15-day stability period suggesting forecaster consensus
- The sophisticated nature of Metaculus forecasters who understand the semantic distinction

The main scenario for prediction increase is Trump making a dramatic sovereignty claim that temporarily spikes the prediction before reality reasserts. But even Trump's recent statements have moderated toward cooperation frameworks rather than acquisition.

## Probability Calibration

Given the strong evidence that:
1. All parties reject sovereignty transfer (vs. military cooperation)
2. Forecasters have had 15 days to process this distinction
3. The 10.00% prediction represents informed equilibrium
4. 8-day window is relatively short for major developments

I calibrate downward from the 27% outside view to approximately **18-20%**.

This reflects:
- ~15% chance of Trump making dramatic sovereignty statement that temporarily moves prediction
- ~3-5% chance of other news/leaks that increase probability
- Low probability of random drift given current stability

The prediction being exactly at 10.00% threshold suggests forecasters have deliberately positioned there, expecting stability rather than movement.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Metaculus community prediction for "US gains formal sovereignty over part of Greenland in 2026" exceed 10.00% on February 14, 2026?

2. **Base rate alignment:** Outside view was 27%, calibrated down to 18% based on strong structural evidence against sovereignty transfer and forecaster sophistication.

3. **Consistency check:** "18 out of 100 times, the community prediction rises above 10.00% by February 14." This aligns with low probability of dramatic sovereignty news in 8-day window given current trajectory toward military cooperation (not sovereignty) frameworks.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - All parties (Greenland, Denmark, EU) explicitly reject sovereignty transfer while discussing military cooperation
   - 15-day stability at 10.00% suggests forecaster consensus post-information processing
   - Trump's rhetoric shifted from acquisition to cooperation "framework"
   - Poll shows 76% Greenlandic opposition, creating political impossibility
   - Resolution requires formal sovereignty, not military access agreements

5. **Blind spot:** Trump makes unexpected dramatic statement claiming sovereignty progress or leaked documents suggest actual sovereignty negotiations (not just military access), causing temporary prediction spike before reality reasserts.

6. **Status quo:** Current 10.00% prediction has been stable for 15 days through multiple news cycles. Low volatility regime suggests status quo (prediction stays ≤10.00%) is most likely outcome.

Probability: 18%
