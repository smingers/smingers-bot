Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / resolution alignment  
This question resolves **Yes** iff the **Metaculus community prediction (CP)** for “US gains formal sovereignty over ≥1% of Greenland during 2026” is **strictly > 10.00%** at **2026-02-14 22:27:56**; otherwise **No** (≤10.00%). It’s about the *crowd’s probability*, not the underlying geopolitical event.

2) (a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; facts vs opinion)

**BBC (Jan 22, 2026) – “framework of a future deal”**  
- Facts: Trump claims a “framework”; Denmark/Greenland reiterate sovereignty is a red line; NATO SG Rutte says he didn’t discuss Danish sovereignty; unnamed officials float “sovereign base areas” concept; US already has broad basing rights under 1951 agreement.  
- Quality: High (major outlet; multiple attributable quotes).  
- Interpretation risk: “Framework” is vague; the sovereign-bases idea is attributed to anonymous officials (weaker).

**BBC (Jan 22, 2026) – tariffs walked back, negotiations continue**  
- Facts: Trump cancels threatened tariffs; says he won’t use force; diplomatic sources say no agreement for US control/ownership; Denmark/Greenland state sovereignty non-negotiable.  
- Quality: High.  
- Key point: signals *de-escalation* from coercive tools (force/tariffs), which tends to reduce perceived chance of sovereignty transfer.

**Brookings (Jan 15, 2026) – analysis of Trump stepping back from force threats**  
- Facts: contextual timeline; notes market/NATO/EU constraints; historical background (Truman offer, 1951 agreement).  
- Opinion: interpretive claim that opposition + markets constrained Trump.  
- Quality: High for context; it’s think-tank analysis (not definitive).

**Verfassungsblog (Feb 4, 2026) – legal opinion against “sovereign bases”**  
- Facts: references 1951 agreement, self-determination principles, Chagos advisory opinion; argues threats of force would taint any transfer.  
- Opinion: strong normative conclusion (“should be ruled out”).  
- Quality: Medium-High as expert legal commentary; still advocacy/argument.

**Al Jazeera/PolitiFact (Jan 23, 2026) – fact-checking Trump’s history claims**  
- Facts: US never held sovereignty; Denmark’s sovereignty recognized; US voted for UN status change; mentions market dip.  
- Quality: Medium-High; mostly about historical correctness, not forward probability.

**Euronews (Feb 2, 2026) – Ozempic leverage**  
- Facts: Denmark pharma export stats; experts argue Denmark has limited leverage via drug supply.  
- Quality: Medium; useful but indirect to sovereignty likelihood.

**AskNews: Polls (Copenhagen Post / The Hill / Newsmax, Feb 2–4, 2026)**  
- Facts: ~610-person poll; ~76% oppose becoming part of US; ~8% support; ~54% worried about US military deployment; MoE ~±4%.  
- Quality: Moderate (credible poll details via Copenhagen Post; secondary reporting elsewhere).  
- Relevance: indicates very low popular consent in Greenland—important because any “binding agreement” path is politically harder without local buy-in.

**AskNews: ANI (Feb 4, 2026) – Trump says negotiations started and “pretty well agreed”**  
- Facts: attributes quote to Trump; mentions Canada opening consulate in Nuuk.  
- Quality: Medium-Low (ANI can be noisy; and it’s a single-actor claim).  
- Relevance: could cause short-term CP uptick due to headline impact, despite lack of substantiation.

**AskNews: France24 / Irish Independent / others (Feb 2–3, 2026) – Greenland PM rejects US control**  
- Facts: Greenland leadership reiterates “not for sale,” sovereignty red lines, psychological stress; talks ongoing.  
- Quality: Medium-High (France24 etc.).  
- Relevance: reinforces resistance; likely downward pressure on CP.

**AskNews: Nikkei Asia (Jan 14, 2026) – Polymarket odds ~18%**  
- Facts: claims >$5m wagered; odds 18%.  
- Quality: Medium; market odds are real signals but can be hype-prone and not always aligned with Metaculus culture.  
- Relevance: a “market > Metaculus CP” gap can pull some forecasters upward, but Metaculus often remains more base-rate anchored.

3) (b) Evidence analysis with weighting (what moves CP by Feb 14?)

Structural / strong evidence (pushes CP down or keeps it flat):
- **Repeated, explicit Denmark + Greenland “sovereignty is a red line / not for sale”** (BBC; multiple outlets). This is a *hard constraint* on the “binding agreement granting sovereignty” pathway. **Strong (downward).**
- **Greenland public opinion strongly opposed (≈76% against)**, making democratic legitimacy for any sovereignty transfer extremely unlikely in 2026. **Moderate-Strong (downward).**
- **Trump publicly walks back force, cancels tariff threats** (BBC/Brookings). Reduces coercive leverage that could have made a sovereignty concession more plausible. **Moderate (downward).**

Moderate / mixed evidence (can create volatility around 10%):
- **“Framework of a future deal” headline + talk of sovereign bases** (BBC; anonymous officials). Even if not sovereignty, it’s easy to misread as sovereignty-adjacent, potentially lifting CP. **Moderate (upward on sentiment; but ambiguous).**
- **Polymarket ~18%** may attract “why is Metaculus only 10%?” updates. **Moderate (upward), but platform-to-platform translation is unreliable.**

Weak evidence (small, noisy effects):
- Russian/foreign commentary (Medvedev/EADaily), speculative/propagandistic takes. **Weak.**
- Legal blog argument (Verfassungsblog) likely aligns with Metaculus skepticism but rarely causes large CP moves alone. **Weak-Moderate (downward).**
- Canada/France opening consulates signals international support for Greenland sovereignty—symbolic but not directly determinative. **Weak (downward).**

Net effect on the *Metaculus CP by Feb 14*:  
Most new, concrete information since Feb 1 (polling + repeated red lines + de-escalation) plausibly nudges CP **below** 10 rather than above. The main upward force is *headline volatility* around “framework / pretty well agreed,” but that has been repeatedly paired with explicit denials of sovereignty concession.

4) (c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left: **8 days** (Feb 6 → Feb 14).  
- Metaculus CPs are often “sticky” absent a sharp new development. The threshold is knife-edge: **must be strictly >10.00**, not “about 10.”  
- If timeframe were **halved (4 days)**: even less time for new forecasts/news to move the median; I’d shift slightly toward “No” (lower chance CP rises).  
- If timeframe were **doubled (16 days)**: more chance of another negotiation headline, leak, or Trump escalation causing a temporary spike; I’d raise the “Yes” chance somewhat.

5) (d) Justification: updating the outside view (35%) to an inside view
Outside view base rate you provided: **35%** chance CP >10% on Feb 14.

Inside-view adjustments:
- **Downward adjustment**: Since Feb 1, the information flow is more “Greenland/Denmark reject sovereignty; Greenlanders oppose; force/tariffs walked back” than “binding sovereignty deal imminent.” That makes it more likely Metaculus drifts to **9–10** than **10–12**. (–6 to –10 pts)
- **Upward adjustment (smaller)**: Trump “pretty well agreed” / “framework” headlines + Polymarket 18% can create a short-lived perception bump. (+1 to +3 pts)
- Status quo pull: CP is exactly at the cutoff; even “no change” yields **No**. That asymmetry slightly reduces the “Yes” probability unless we expect upward drift.

Net: 35% → about **27%**.

Probability calibration:
I estimate a **27%** chance that the Metaculus community prediction is **strictly greater than 10.00%** at the target timestamp on 2026-02-14.

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: Will Metaculus CP for “US gains ≥1% Greenland sovereignty in 2026” be >10.00% at 2026-02-14 22:27:56?  
2) Outside view base rate: 35%.  
3) Consistency: 27 out of 100 times, the CP ends up >10.00% at that timestamp.  
4) Key evidence (most significant):
   - Denmark + Greenland repeatedly: sovereignty not negotiable (multiple major outlets).  
   - Greenland poll: ~76% oppose joining US; weak local consent.  
   - Trump de-escalated (no force; tariffs canceled) reducing coercion pathway.  
   - Counterweight: “framework/pretty well agreed” headlines + Polymarket ~18% can lift sentiment.  
5) Blind spot: A credible leak/announcement of a draft treaty wording implying “sovereign base areas” could spike CP above 10 quickly.  
6) Status quo: CP at 10.00%; absent a catalyst, stickiness + cutoff asymmetry favors “No.”

Probability: 27%
