Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (condensed)
1. BBC (22 Jan, 06 Feb follow-ups). Reputable outlet; gives direct quotes from Trump, Danish & NATO officials. Mostly factual – good quality.  
2. Brookings (15 Jan). Think-tank commentary by William Galston; reliable but opinion-heavy. Moderate quality.  
3. Verfassungsblog (04 Feb). Peer-reviewed legal scholars; high expertise but normative argument. High quality for “legal difficulty” evidence.  
4. Polls reported by NewsMax / The Hill / Copenhagen Post (02-04 Feb). Same 610-respondent survey; credible methodology, margin ±4 pp. Good quality.  
5. Manifold / Polymarket odds (Jan-Feb). Crowd estimates with incentives; useful as “what other crowds think”. Medium quality.  
6. EADaily, Storm.mg, other partisan pieces. Poor-to-mixed reliability, many unverifiable claims. Used only to gauge noise level, not facts.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence  
• Denmark & Greenland leaders (multiple mainstream sources) repeat that sovereignty is a “red line” – structural, hard to change.  
• Recent poll: 76 % of Greenlanders reject joining the US – reinforces political barrier.  
• Legal scholarship: any detachment would breach self-determination norms; extremely high legal/institutional friction.

Moderate evidence  
• Trump claims a “framework deal” is forming (BBC, Guardian). Raises salience but details absent.  
• Prediction markets (Polymarket 18 %) show some outsiders find the scenario plausible. May attract a few optimistic Metaculus forecasters.

Weak evidence  
• Russian and Chinese commentary predicting inevitable annexation (EADaily et al.). Low credibility, mostly rhetoric.  
• Media speculation on Cyprus-style sovereign bases – still short of “formal sovereignty” threshold in target question.

Weights on Metaculus CP (>10 %)  
Downward drivers (strong): legal-political impossibility narrative, unified Greenlandic/Danish rejection, poll data, fading tariff/threat headlines.  
Upward drivers (moderate): Trump’s ongoing rhetoric keeps the story in the news; outside platforms price ~18 % could pull some forecasters up; 10 % is a sticky round number—any small bullish shift moves CP above the trigger.

Net: evidence tilts slightly toward CP drifting ≤10 %.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Days until cut-off: 8.5.  
• Typical 1-week volatility for a Metaculus geo binary near 10 % is roughly ±2 pp (median-weighted method dampens swings).  
• Halving the window (4 days) would harden the status-quo call; I’d drop probability ~5 pp. Doubling (17 days) gives more room for attention spikes; I’d raise probability ~7 pp.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base (derived earlier from ~200 similar Metaculus snapshots) put P(CP > 10 %) at 44 %.  
Adjustments:  
– – 8 pp: Strong legal/political barriers surfaced clearly since late Jan; likely to push some forecasters lower.  
– – 4 pp: Lack of any concrete “deal” details in the past ten days reduces momentum.  
+ 5 pp: Cross-platform crowds (Manifold 19 %) and renewed Trump sound-bites could entice a few bullish newcomers.  
Net inside-view = 44 % − 8 − 4 + 5 ≈ 37 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that in 37 out of 100 similar Metaculus questions starting at exactly 10 % with eight days left and no fresh pro-event evidence, the community prediction would end up above 10 % at the deadline.”  Uncertainty ±7 pp (one-sigma).  I would update quickly if (i) a leaked draft treaty surfaces (~+10 pp) or (ii) major media move on to other stories (~−6 pp).

Checklist:
1. Title paraphrase: “Will Metaculus median for ‘US gains Greenland sovereignty in 2026’ exceed 10 % on 14 Feb 2026?”  
2. Base rate stated (44 %).  
3. Consistency line given above.  
4. Key evidence: a) unified Danish/Greenland rejection; b) 76 % poll against annexation; c) no concrete treaty text; d) Manifold odds 18 %; e) 8-day horizon/CP stickiness.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden leak of a signed memorandum giving the US a sovereign enclave, triggering a CP jump above 15 %.  
6. Status-quo bias considered; slight nudge toward ≤10 % retained.

Probability: 37%
