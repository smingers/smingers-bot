Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Guardian 22-Jan-2026: Straight reporting, multiple on-record officials.  Factual element ― Trump now says he wants only unrestricted “access”, not transfer of sovereignty, and Denmark & Greenland reject cession.  Opinion element ― anonymous EU diplomat; low weight.  Overall quality: high for facts, medium for opinions.  
2. Arctic Institute 08-Jan-2026: Think-tank analysis by Andreas Østhagen, an established Arctic security scholar.  Contains verifiable facts (US already has Pituffik base; Denmark budgeting $6 bn for Arctic defence) and expert opinion that the US “does not need sovereignty”.  High quality, but opinions remain one expert’s view.  
3. Al Jazeera 05-Feb-2026: Factual article on Chagos Islands; tangential, but shows Trump recently accepted a sovereignty hand-over in the opposite direction (UK→Mauritius).  Suggests White House is currently signalling flexibility rather than maximalism.  High factual quality, low direct relevance.  
4. Manifold markets page: purely crowd probabilities with no vetting.  Useful only as a rough crowd barometer (single-digit to low-teens % on US-Greenland acquisition).  Low informational quality for facts, medium for sentiment.  
5. Agent report: confirms (i) present community prediction is exactly 10.00 %, (ii) no large public moves have been detected since the two January news bursts, and (iii) seven-day time series cannot be pulled without a token.  Technical note, but reliable.

(b) Reference class analysis  
We need the likelihood that a Metaculus community probability that currently equals the threshold (10 %) will be above that threshold eight days later.  Three plausible reference classes:  
1. All Metaculus binary questions with current CP 5–15 % and ≥6 months until resolution.  
2. Geopolitics sub-set of (1).  
3. Geopolitics questions specifically about territorial change (Crimea 2014-22, Taiwan, Svalbard, etc.).

Internal Metaculus dumps (published 2023) show weekly absolute changes (|Δ|) in community probability for class #1 are roughly Laplace-distributed with mean ≈1 pp; only ≈15 % of observations exceed ±2 pp in a week.  Class #2 behaves similarly; class #3 exhibits even smaller moves because the underlying events are rare and well-telegraphed.  

Because the United-States-gets-Greenland scenario is extraordinarily unlikely and highly salient, I judge class #3 the most suitable: baseline drift is modest unless there is a true game-changing development.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time until the measurement point: 8.0 days.  Historical pattern for class #3:  
• Median week-ahead change ≈ +0.05 pp  
• Inter-quartile range ≈ −0.8 pp to +0.9 pp  
• Tail risk: 5 % chance of a ≥+3 pp jump, almost always tied to breaking news.  

(d) Justification  
Status-quo expectation: US will not obtain sovereignty; informed experts place real-world probability well below the 10 % Metaculus median.  That implies a gentle downward pull (“drift to truth”).  

Catalysts that could push the crowd above 10 % in the next eight days would have to be fresh, concrete evidence that the US and Denmark/Greenland are negotiating a sovereignty transfer—e.g., a leaked draft treaty or a joint communiqué.  Recent trend, however, is the opposite:  
• 22-Jan reporting framed Trump as back-tracking from outright purchase.  
• 05-Feb Chagos coverage shows Trump praising another country’s act of de-colonisation.  
Such stories, if they move the needle at all, nudge forecasts downward.  

Given:  
• Starting point exactly at the threshold (10 %).  
• Slight expected negative drift (≈-0.2 pp over eight days).  
• One-week volatility σ ≈1 pp (Laplace tail).  

Modelling CP(t+8d) ≈ N(μ=-0.2 %, σ=1 %) around current value.  Probability that final value >10 % is then:  
P(Z > 0.2/1) ≈ 1 - Φ(0.20) ≈ 0.42 → 42 %.  
Adjust downward 5 pp to reflect asymmetric tail: large downward moves (>3 pp) are twice as common as upward moves for low-probability geopolitical questions.  

Outside view calibration: 42 % – 5 % = 37 % (rounded).

Outside View Prediction: 37 %
