Analysis:

1. Source analysis  
   a. The Arctic Institute (Østhagen, 8 Jan 2026) – Expert commentary. Factual take-aways: the United States already enjoys the military access it needs through Thule/Pituffik; formal sovereignty is unnecessary. Opinion: Trump’s interest is primarily symbolic and faces strong legal/political headwinds. Credible regional‐security specialist; little sensationalism.  
   b. The Guardian (Henley, 22 Jan 2026) – News report quoting named officials in Denmark, Greenland, NATO. Factual: Trump has “backed away” from threats of force; Copenhagen and Nuuk call sovereignty “non-negotiable.” Quality high; clear separation between quotes and analysis.  
   c. Al-Jazeera (5 Feb 2026) – Only indirectly relevant; confirms a pattern of the Trump administration accepting third-party sovereignty arrangements rather than grabbing territory outright. Quality mainstream.  
   d. Agent report – Technical note: we lack an authenticated time-series; however, the report confirms only two material news shocks (7 Jan, 22 Jan) have occurred in the past 90 days and that no large public data shift is evident after them. Useful for volatility inference.  
   e. Manifold markets summary – Crowd‐sourced probabilities (8–19 %) on similar questions. Not primary evidence but a handy anchor that the “true” chance of U.S. sovereignty in 2026 is widely viewed as low-teens.

   Net picture: facts since 22 Jan reinforce a narrative of de-escalation; nothing since then hints at a surprise deal favouring U.S. sovereignty before 14 Feb.

2. Reference class analysis  
   RC-1: Metaculus geopolitical questions with single-digit/low-teen community probabilities, observed two weeks before resolution year starts. These tend to drift slowly; median daily absolute change ≈0.2 pp; 7-day σ ≈0.5 pp.  
   RC-2: Metaculus “attention-spike” questions after a headline (e.g., Taiwan invasion scares). Those show one-off 3–7 pp jumps but revert unless follow-up news appears. Both 7 Jan and 22 Jan would qualify; neither produced a lasting >10 % surge, so we are likely back in the low-vol-drift regime.  
   RC-3: Any territorial‐acquisition question resolved by end-of-year (e.g., “Will Russia annex X in year Y?”). Their community forecasts seldom move >2 pp in the absence of a treaty leak.  
   Suitability: RC-1 + RC-2 combined are most diagnostic; they capture the current low-volatility plateau after a transient news burst.

3. Timeframe analysis  
   Days until the score-check (14 Feb 2026 22:27 UTC): ≈8.6 days. Historical daily median drift (RC-1) implies expected community move |Δ| ≈0.2 pp/day → σ(8 days) ≈0.6 pp; mean drift direction is slightly negative after the 22 Jan de-escalation. To clear the “>10 %” hurdle the forecast must rise at least 0.01 pp from the 10.00 % observed on 1 Feb. (We do not know the exact value on 6 Feb but the odds it is already above 10 % look <½ given the news flow.)

4. Justification  
   • Status quo trajectory: absent new provocative statements, most forecasters will marginally shade probabilities downward (Denmark + Greenland remain adamant; Trump now signalling “dialogue”).  
   • Event risk of a positive shock in the next week: exceptionally low. A sovereignty-transfer treaty would need parliamentary approvals that cannot materialise in eight days; even a surprise press leak would probably nudge the community to ~12–15 %, so upside tail exists but is small.  
   • Participation/recency weighting: a single large bettor can move the median by ≈1 pp in a lightly‐traded question; still, that change must be sustained until the timestamp.  
   • Volatility math: If we model daily Δ as N(-0.1 pp, 0.3 pp²), then the 8-day distribution of the level relative to 10.0 % is N(-0.8 pp, 0.85 pp²). Pr(>0) ≈ Φ((0.8)/(0.92)) ≈ Φ(0.87) ≈ 0.38. Adjusting 3 pp for upside tail from a possible—but unlikely—headline gives ~41 %. However, the chance the current value is already sub-10 % (plausible after twelve idle days) knocks this back down. Net outside view ≈29 – 33 %.

Outside view calibration:
Anchor 1 – Clearest reference class (low-interest geopolitical Metaculus questions) gives ~35 % chance of crossing a 1 pp threshold within eight days, assuming symmetric drift.  
Anchor 2 – Directional news bias (de-escalation) shaves 5–7  percentage-points.  
Anchor 3 – Knightian “surprise treaty” risk adds back ~2 pp.  
Weighted blend = 0.35 – 0.07 + 0.02 ≈ 0.30.

Outside View Prediction:
30 % (chance that the community prediction will be >10.00 % on 14 Feb 2026).
