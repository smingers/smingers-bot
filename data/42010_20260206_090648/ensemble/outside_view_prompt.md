You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 10.00% on 2026-02-14 for the Metaculus question "Will the United States gain formal sovereignty over any part of Greenland during 2026?"?

Question background:
Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. 

--------------------------------

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41502
- Original question title: Will the United States gain formal sovereignty over any part of Greenland during 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-01: 10.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as Yes if, before 2027, at least one of the following occur:
> 
> 1. The United States controls Greenland and any part of Greenland comes under formal sovereignty of the United States, defined as the US government enacting a statute that declares 1% or more of the land area of Greenland to under the sovereignty of the United States.&#x20;
> 2. A binding agreement which grants the United States sovereignty over 1% or more of the land area of Greenland, even if implementation is pending, is formally agreed upon by the U.S government and either the Government of Denmark and/or the Government of Greenland.

Original background: 
> [White House says using US military is ‘always an option’ for seizing Greenland](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/06/trump-greenland-control-us-military):
> 
> > In January 2026, the White House stated that using the US military to acquire Greenland was “always an option,” prompting strong pushback from Denmark, Greenland, and European leaders. Greenland’s government has repeatedly stated that it does not wish to become part of the United States.
> 
> > “President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it’s vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region. The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41502) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-14 22:27:56 is higher than 10.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 10.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-14 22:27:56, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

# Summary of "Trump & Greenland: Is There Logic in the Chaos?"

**Source:** The Arctic Institute - Center for Circumpolar Security Studies  
**Date:** January 8, 2026  
**Author:** Andreas Østhagen

## Key Facts and Analysis:

### Economic/Resource Motivations:
- Greenland has large proven resources and several active mines extracting minerals
- Trump is reportedly driven by desire for economic gain through giving American companies special access to deals
- **Rumor:** An Australian geologist made Trump aware of Greenland's resource potential in 2019
- **Author's assessment:** The US does not need sovereignty over Greenland to access resources; companies (not "the US") extract resources
- Alaska also has great untapped mineral potential

### Possible Concessions (Author's Speculation):
- Denmark/Greenland might release more areas for mining, potentially in conflict with Greenlandic interests
- American companies could be prioritized in cooperation with Greenlandic ones
- **Author notes:** This would violate competition rules and Greenland's right to self-determination

### Strategic/Military Context:
- Russia's strategic nuclear weapons are mostly located on the Kola Peninsula (near Norway), not near Greenland
- US already has Pituffik military base in northwest Greenland where US Space Force monitors potential Russian threats
- Russian naval vessels sail in the Barents Sea, not around Greenland
- Chinese ships mainly sail to/from Russia and outside Alaska, not around Greenland
- Chinese investment projects in Greenland have been put on hold for security reasons

### Existing Danish Commitments:
- Copenhagen has promised to invest **over $6 billion USD** in defense capabilities in Greenland
- Denmark will purchase more F-35 fighter jets and P-8 surveillance aircraft from the United States
- **Author's assessment:** This will "probably not be enough"

### Additional Possible Concessions (Author's Speculation):
- A new Danish and/or American base might need to be built on Greenland
- A symbolic defense agreement where the US officially becomes responsible for Greenland's defense
- Denmark sending frigates and fighter jets to Alaska for exercises

### Trump's Geopolitical Framework:
- Trump referenced the **Monroe Doctrine** (1823) at a January 4 press conference
- Author interprets this as "19th century great power politics" where the most powerful nation controls its immediate vicinity
- Author compares this to Russia wanting control over Estonia, Ukraine, Moldova and China over Vietnam, Mongolia, Taiwan
- Trump met Putin in Alaska in **August 2025**, discussing economic cooperation projects in the Arctic

### Author's Concerns:
- This approach represents a "zero-sum game" mindset that contrasts with modern international norms
- Bad news for Denmark if this becomes US guideline
- Could set precedent for other territorial claims (e.g., Russia over Svalbard)

**Note:** This article is an opinion/analysis piece by a named expert. The author's assessments about what concessions "might" be needed and speculation about Trump's motivations should be treated as expert opinion rather than confirmed facts.

# Summary of Guardian Article: "Greenland says red lines must be respected as Trump says US will have 'total' access to island"

**Date:** January 22, 2026  
**Source:** The Guardian  
**Author:** Jon Henley

## Key Facts and Developments:

### Greenland's Position:
- **Jens-Frederik Nielsen** (Greenland's Prime Minister) stated that Greenland's sovereignty is non-negotiable
- Nielsen emphasized "red lines" including territorial integrity, international law, and sovereignty must be respected
- He stated: "If Greenlanders had to choose, we choose the Kingdom of Denmark, we choose the EU, we choose Nato"
- Nielsen clarified that "Nobody other than Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark have the mandate to make deals or agreements about Greenland"

### Trump Administration Claims:
- Trump claimed an agreement with NATO would give the US "total access" to Greenland with "no end, no time limit"
- Trump described this as the "framework of a future deal"
- **JD Vance** (US Vice President) said negotiations with NATO were "going fine" and stated Greenland matters because "our entire missile defence relies on security in the Arctic"
- Trump backed away from his threat to use tariffs and ruled out the use of force (as of Wednesday, day before this article)

### Denmark's Stance:
- **Mette Frederiksen** (Danish Prime Minister) emphasized Denmark's sovereignty "cannot be discussed, it cannot be changed"
- She stated NATO states backed having a "permanent presence" in the Arctic, including around Greenland
- Frederiksen said Denmark wishes to continue dialogue "provided this is done with respect for our territorial integrity"

### NATO's Role:
- **Mark Rutte** (NATO Secretary General) said he had a "very good discussion" with Trump about bolstering Arctic security
- Rutte told Reuters that NATO senior commanders would "work out what is necessary" and hoped this could be done "early in 2026"
- One workstream is to "ensure that the Chinese and the Russians will not gain access to the Greenland economy [or] militarily to Greenland"
- **Gen Alexus Grynkewich** (NATO's top military commander in Europe) said no planning has started but they're "ready"

### European Reaction:
- **Kaja Kallas** (EU foreign policy chief) said transatlantic relations "have definitely taken a big blow over the last week"
- **Friedrich Merz** (German Chancellor) welcomed Trump's change of heart, expressing gratitude that Trump "distanced himself from his original plans to take over Greenland"
- **Emmanuel Macron** said Europe needed to "remain extremely vigilant"
- **Teresa Ribera** (European Commission executive vice-president) warned: "Silence is too ambiguous, too dangerous"
- An unnamed European diplomat stated: "EU firmness and unity have contributed to get him to change his position"

### Background Context:
- Trump had threatened to impose a 10% tariff on imports from Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland unless they dropped objections to his Greenland plans
- EU had considered retaliatory action including tariffs on €93 billion (£80 billion) of US imports
- The US already has a military base on Greenland and a bilateral agreement with Denmark allowing expansion of its presence

### Less Reliable/Unnamed Sources:
- An unnamed European diplomat attributed Trump's position change to "EU firmness and unity," "internal political pressure in the US, and market reaction"

# Summary of Article: "Trump tempers criticism of UK's Chagos Islands deal after talk with Starmer"

**Key Facts:**

1. **Trump's Position Shift**: US President Donald Trump appears to have endorsed the UK's deal to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, after previously calling it a "great stupidity" last month.

2. **The Deal Details**: Under an agreement from May (last year), the UK and Mauritius announced that full sovereignty of the Chagos archipelago (more than 60 islands) would transfer to Mauritius, in exchange for guarantees that the US military base on Diego Garcia could continue operating for the next 99 years.

3. **Trump-Starmer Talks**: Trump held talks with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday and stated Starmer had made the "best deal he could make."

4. **US Military Assurances**: Trump warned in a Truth Social post that the US would retain the right to "militarily secure and reinforce" the US presence on Diego Garcia if threatened.

5. **Official Statement**: The British government stated that "the leaders agreed their governments would continue working closely to guarantee the future operation of the base and speak again soon."

**Historical Context Provided:**

- The Chagos Islands have been under British control since 1814
- In the 1960s and 1970s, Britain forcibly evicted nearly 2,000 locals to make way for the US military base
- The base played a pivotal role in US military operations in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan
- In 2008, the US acknowledged the base had been used for covert rendition flights of "terrorism" suspects

**Relevance to Greenland Question**: While this article discusses a different territorial sovereignty issue (Chagos Islands, not Greenland), it provides context on Trump's recent approach to territorial sovereignty negotiations involving US military interests.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Fetch time series of community prediction for Metaculus question 41502 over last 3 months, list significant daily changes with dates, correlate with major Greenland-US sovereignty news, and give current community prediction and number of forecasters.
The fresh search round reconfirms the core finding from the prior memo: virtually all machine-readable data needed to satisfy the four deliverables for Metaculus question 41502 remain behind an authenticated wall.

1. Where the 90-day time series ought to live  
   • The Ergo and forecasting-tools Python wrappers both expose the attribute question.prediction_timeseries, so Metaculus clearly stores a JSON array of dated community predictions.  
   • Nothing in the open-source code points to a public, token-free REST path.  All wrapper examples load an environment variable called METACULUS_TOKEN before they can access either the “timeseries” or “community_prediction” fields (GitHub – Metaculus/forecasting-tools).  
   • No Google result revealed a URL such as /api2/questions/41502/timeseries, nor did we locate a GraphQL endpoint.  Hence, the historic series is effectively private unless an authenticated call is made.

2. Current snapshot (community probability + number of forecasters)  
   • The canonical endpoint /api2/questions/{id} does include community_prediction and num_forecasters in other questions that are publicly scraped, but no anonymously accessible JSON for id 41502 surfaced in search, so the current values remain unknown.  
   • Again, the absence of a token appears to be the blocking factor.

3. Greenland–U.S. sovereignty news in the last three months  
   Two genuinely sovereignty-related news spikes stand out and are the only ones located in global coverage:  
     – 7 Jan 2026: White House press secretary says “acquiring Greenland … nothing off the table, including force.” (multiple mainstream outlets, summarised in earlier memo).  
     – 22 Jan 2026: President Trump in Davos claims a “framework of a future deal” giving the U.S. “all the military access we want” to Greenland; Denmark immediately reiterates that sovereignty is non-negotiable (BBC, 22 Jan 2026; Military.com, 22 Jan 2026; FactCheck.org, 22 Jan 2026).  
   No other sovereignty-specific headlines dated February or March 2026 were returned.

4. Ability to list “significant daily changes”  
   • Because the historic prediction series is still inaccessible, we cannot compute day-over-day deltas or identify >5 percentage-point moves.  
   • Therefore we cannot test whether either the 7 Jan or 22 Jan news bursts coincided with sharp forecast changes.

5. Technical status confirmed  
   • All third-party code examples (Ergo, forecasting-tools) explicitly require METACULUS_TOKEN.  
   • No public endpoint for prediction_timeseries is discoverable.  
   • Manual scraping via the browser is theoretically possible—one could open the interactive chart on Metaculus while logged in and copy the underlying JSON from DevTools—but that still presupposes an authenticated session.

Remaining information gaps  
A. Authenticated pull of prediction_timeseries for question 41502 covering at least the last 90 days.  
B. One snapshot pull of /api2/questions/41502 to obtain current community_prediction and num_forecasters.  
C. Once A is fulfilled, apply a delta filter (e.g., absolute daily change ≥ 5 pp) and list the dates.  
D. Line up those dates with the two known news spikes (7 Jan 2026 and 22 Jan 2026) to provide the requested correlation analysis.

Conclusion  
All four deliverables—(i) 90-day series, (ii) significant daily-change log, (iii) correlation with sovereignty news, (iv) current probability & forecaster count—remain blocked by the same two data gaps (A and B).  The only viable next step is an authenticated API request or a manual export performed while logged in.  Without that, no further progress can be made from open-web sources alone.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
