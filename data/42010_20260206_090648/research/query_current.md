Analysis:
The current community prediction sits exactly at 10 %.  For it to rise above 10 % by 14 Feb we need evidence—political statements, bills in Congress, leaks of negotiations, or Danish/Greenlandic reactions—that would plausibly increase the probability that the U.S. could obtain formal sovereignty over ≥1 % of Greenland during 2026.  
Key signals to look for in the news now:
• Any U.S. legislative activity (e.g., a draft bill, hearings, budget line-items) aimed at purchasing or annexing territory in Greenland.  
• High-level diplomatic meetings or leaked drafts of a “binding agreement” between Washington and Copenhagen/Nuuk.  
• Statements from Danish, Greenlandic, or U.S. officials hinting at a softening (or hardening) of positions since the 1 Feb Guardian article.  
• Military deployments or Pentagon planning documents that suggest imminent action.  
• Reactions from NATO or EU that could influence the feasibility of sovereignty transfer.  
Fresh reporting on any of these could nudge Metaculus forecasters above the current 10 % threshold, so the searches should focus on developments from 1 Feb 2026 onward.
