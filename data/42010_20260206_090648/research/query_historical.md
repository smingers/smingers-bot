Analysis:
This forecast hinges almost entirely on the short-term behavior of the Metaculus community prediction for question 41502.  To judge whether the median-weighted crowd estimate is likely to drift above 10 % in the next eight days, the most useful historical context will be:  
• The recent time-series of that community prediction (especially the past 1–3 months) to gauge momentum and volatility.  
• Comments or news events that have triggered past jumps—for example the early-January White House statement.  
• Very recent and upcoming news about possible U.S. efforts to acquire Greenland that could spark another swing.  
Economic data are irrelevant here.
