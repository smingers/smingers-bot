Certainly I would hope for 2026, I hope even early in 2026\"\n- UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper mentioned setting up an \"Arctic Sentry\" similar to NATO's Baltic Sentry mission\n- Trump has mentioned threats from Chinese and Russian vessels around Greenland (though Denmark says there is no threat \"today\")\n\n**Trump's Stated Rationale:**\n\n- Trump says Greenland is essential for his plan to build a Golden Dome defense system against missile attacks from Russia and China\n- The island has vast, largely untapped reserves of rare earth minerals crucial for technologies including mobile phones and electric vehicles\n- Trump stated US control \"puts everybody in a really good position, especially as it pertains to security and to minerals\"\n\n**Constitutional/Legal Obstacles:**\n\n- There is a constitutional ban on the sale of land in Greenland\n- The Guant\u00e1namo Bay model (permanent lease agreement since 1903) was mentioned as a potential option\n\n**Greenland's Concerns:**\n\n- Greenland's Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt stated his government had not asked him to negotiate on their behalf but to convey \"the red lines directly to President Trump\"\n- There is concern in Greenland that negotiations on their future were being conducted in their absence\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://verfassungsblog.de/why-us-sovereign-bases-in-greenland-would-violate-international-law/\">\n## Summary of Article: \"Why US Sovereign Bases in Greenland Would Violate International Law\"\n\n**Source:** Verfassungsblog, February 04, 2026  \n**Authors:** Markus Gehring, Nasia Hadjigeorgiou\n\n### Key Facts and Developments:\n\n1. **Framework Deal Report:** The New York Times reported that President Trump and NATO have reached the framework of a deal that would grant the US sovereign bases over territories of Greenland.\n\n2. **Comparison to Cyprus Model:** Officials present at negotiations compared the proposed bases to the British Sovereign Base Areas (SBAs) in Cyprus.\n\n3. **Historical Context:** Denmark's title to Greenland has been expressly recognized by the United States in the 1951 Defense of Greenland Agreement and its 2004 update.\n\n4. **Greenlandic Self-Determination:** Greenlanders are constitutionally recognized as a \"people\" with a right to self-determination, including a lawful pathway to independence by referendum and subsequent negotiation.\n\n### Legal Arguments Against Sovereign Bases:\n\n**Consent and Self-Determination:**\n- The authors argue that any consent for sovereign bases must come from Greenlanders themselves, not Denmark or NATO\n- They cite the ICJ's Chagos Archipelago Advisory Opinion, which states that detachment of part of a non-self-governing territory must be based on the \"free and genuine will of the people\" of the concerned territory\n- The authors argue that Trump's threats to use force violate Article 2(4) of the UN Charter (a ius cogens norm), making any transfer of sovereignty null and void\n\n**Cyprus SBAs Comparison:**\n- The Treaty of Establishment 1960 created the UK's SBAs in Cyprus with significant restrictions on sovereignty\n- The authors argue these bases are \"arguably illegal\" and of \"doubtful international legality\" because they contravene principles from the Chagos case\n- They note that contemporary practice for military bases no longer grants enclave sovereignty but only defined functional military rights\n- Trump's vision is described as \"SBAs plus\" that would allow not just military but also commercial development\n\n**Indigenous Rights:**\n- The UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous People requires Free, Prior and Informed Consent for large-scale, high-impact measures affecting indigenous lands\n- Such consent must be supported by prior environmental and social impact assessments and equitable benefit-sharing\n- The International Law Association's 2020 Guidelines affirm duties of sustainable resource management with regard for indigenous rights\n\n**Environmental and Climate Obligations:**\n- The ICJ's 2025 Climate Advisory Opinion confirmed that environmental treaties, customary no-harm rule, and human rights obligations operate cumulatively\n- A sovereignty enclave would impede Denmark/Greenland's ability to carry out due-diligence controls and impact assessments\n- US law does not treat sovereign bases like Guantanamo as US territory, meaning neither US domestic nor international law would fully apply\n\n### Expert Opinion:\nThe authors conclude that establishing US sovereign enclaves in Greenland would constitute \"multiple breaches of international law\" including violations of the UN Charter, ius cogens norms, the right of self-determination, indigenous peoples' rights, and environmental/human rights duties. They recommend it \"should be ruled out.\"\n\n**Note:** This is an opinion piece by legal scholars arguing against the legality of the proposed arrangement, not a neutral news report.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-follows-president-trump-decision-to-step-back-from-threatening-to-use-force-in-greenland/\">\n# Summary of Brookings Article on Trump's Greenland Policy\n\n**Key Facts and Timeline:**\n\n- **Date of article:** January 15, 2026\n- **Current situation:** President Trump withdrew his threat to use military force to acquire Greenland during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland\n- **Greenland details:** Large, ice-covered island with approximately 56,000 people; part of the Kingdom of Denmark\n- **Trump's initial approach:** Announced intentions to annex Greenland either by purchasing it from Denmark or taking it militarily\n\n**Reasons for Trump's Reversal (per article analysis):**\n\n1. **NATO implications:** Denmark is a NATO member; an attack on Greenland would constitute an attack by one NATO member on another, effectively ending the alliance\n2. **Economic pressure:** Prospect of economic countermeasures by EU countries with significant trade ties to the U.S.\n3. **Market reactions:** Stock market took \"a big fall\" due to fear of economic chaos from Trump's threats\n4. **Pattern noted:** Similar to Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcement last spring, adverse market reaction caused him to back down\n\n**Historical Context Provided:**\n\n- **1944:** President Harry Truman secretly offered Denmark $100 million for Greenland (Congress never knew); Denmark declined\n- **1951:** \"Defense of Greenland Agreement\" negotiated, giving the U.S. essentially carte blanche regarding military presence in Greenland\n- **WWII and Cold War:** U.S. had up to 50 military installations in Greenland; now reduced to one air force base\n- **1915-1917:** U.S. successfully purchased Danish West Indies (now U.S. Virgin Islands) for $25 million in gold coins, with Secretary of State Lansing threatening occupation to pressure Denmark\n\n**Current Status and Future Possibilities:**\n\n- Military force declared off the table \"at least for now\"\n- Trump's remaining options: forget the issue, announce security enhancements in Greenland, or continue attempting to purchase the island\n- Denmark has repeatedly stated Greenland is not for sale\n- A U.S.-European Union trade deal is due to be signed soon\n\n**European Response:**\n\n- European leaders insist Greenland's sovereignty is crucial to any deal\n- Discussion of deploying the \"bazooka option\" - the EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument, which could restrict American products from EU countries (never previously deployed)\n- Article suggests Europe is moving to shield itself from Trump administration unpredictability\n\n**Author's Analysis:**\nWilliam A. Galston (author) suggests that Trump may not be as unconstrained in foreign policy as some believe - coordinated opposition backed by sliding markets appears to constrain him. The article questions whether this episode marks \"the beginning of the end for NATO and the stable global trading order.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cgezx40r7d7o\">\n# Summary of BBC Article on Trump's Greenland Discussions (January 22, 2026)\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**Trump's Announcement:**\n- Trump announced on Truth Social that the US has formed \"the framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland and, in fact, the entire Arctic Region\"\n- He stated Secretary of State Marco Rubio and Special Envoy Steve Witkoff would \"report directly\" to him as negotiations continue\n- Trump backed off threats to impose tariffs on European allies (including Denmark) that had opposed his Greenland acquisition plans\n\n**Tariff Threats Withdrawn:**\n- Trump had threatened 10% tariffs on goods from UK, Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, Netherlands, and Finland starting February 1st (increasing to 25% by June 1st) until a Greenland deal was reached\n- These tariffs were cancelled following the meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte\n\n**Nature of Potential Deal:**\n- Trump suggested the deal could involve mineral rights and Greenland's strategic location\n- He described it as \"the ultimate long-term deal\" that \"puts everybody in a really good position, especially as it pertains to security and to minerals\"\n- According to US media reports, the plan could allow the US to build more military bases on Greenland\n- The New York Times reported a template might be similar to British sovereign bases in Cyprus (which remained under UK sovereignty after Cyprus independence in 1960)\n\n**Official Statements:**\n\n*NATO:*\n- NATO spokeswoman Allison Hart: \"Negotiations between Denmark, Greenland, and the United States will go forward aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold - economically or militarily - in Greenland\"\n- NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte told Fox News the \"issue [of Danish sovereignty] did not come up anymore in my conversations tonight with the president\"\n\n*Denmark:*\n- Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen: \"Now, let's sit down and find out how we can address the American security concerns in the Arctic while respecting the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark\"\n- Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen (January 23rd): Denmark could negotiate on \"everything political; security, investments, economy.

It would not be a very smart move for them to do this.\"\n- If Novo Nordisk disappears from the market temporarily and Eli Lilly's tablet comes out: \"that would be a major, major loss for Novo\"\n- Notes that restrictions would trigger FDA shortage designation, allowing compounding pharmacies to make unapproved versions\n\n**Prashant Yadav** (senior fellow for global health, Council on Foreign Relations):\n- US tariffs would have limited effectiveness because Novo Nordisk already has fill-and-finish operations in North Carolina\n- Danish export restrictions would have limited impact because these drugs are not essential medications like antibiotics or cancer medicines\n- The US has \"large dependency\" on Danish obesity drugs due to market share split\n\n## Context:\n\nThe article discusses Denmark's pharmaceutical leverage (or lack thereof) as Denmark begins talks with the United States over a potential Greenland deal. It examines whether Denmark's dominant weight loss drug exports could provide negotiating power, with experts concluding that such leverage would be limited due to US manufacturing presence, competition from Eli Lilly, and legal loopholes allowing drug compounding during shortages.\n</Summary>\n\n<Asknews_articles>\nQuery: Will the community prediction be higher than 10.00% on 2026-02-14 for the Metaculus question \"Will the United States gain formal sovereignty over any part of Greenland during 2026?\"?\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Medvedev Warns Europe: Greenland Issue Is Just the Beginning of Sovereignty Loss**\nDmitry Medvedev, Deputy Chairman of the Russian Security Council, warned that Europe will have to pay for its energy shift away from Russian sources by surrendering parts of its sovereignty, with the situation over Greenland being just the beginning. Speaking in his Max channel, Medvedev stated that Europe's move away from Russian energy has led to 'critical dependence on American gas,' forcing it to comply with U.S. demands regardless of who is in power in Washington. He emphasized that the cost will be the remaining sovereignty of EU members. Medvedev referenced former U.S. President Donald Trump's repeated declarations about acquiring Greenland, including proposals to buy the island during his first term and assertions in March 2025 that it could be annexed. Greenland is an autonomous territory within Denmark, and under a 1951 U.S.-Denmark agreement, the U.S. is responsible for defending the island under NATO commitments. EADaily noted that in late January 2026, Trump announced negotiations on Greenland's future and expressed confidence in reaching a beneficial deal for both the U.S. and Europe.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 08:02 AM\nSource:[EADaily](https://eadaily.com/ru/news/2026/02/06/medvedev-pripugnul-liderov-evropy-grenlandiya-tolko-nachalo)\n\n**Poll: 76% of Greenlanders Reject Becoming Part of the US**\nA poll conducted from January 18 to 28, 2026, among 610 adults in Greenland, revealed that 76% of respondents reject the idea of Greenland becoming part of the United States, while 16% said they do not know. Survey expert Sune Steffen Hansen, who conducted the poll, stated that the results show Greenlanders clearly reject U.S. acquisition and are generally satisfied with their current status. The survey also found that 54% of Greenlanders are 'worried' or 'very worried' about the possibility of the U.S. deploying military forces to take control, while 40% are not worried. The poll has a margin of error of \u00b14 percentage points. This comes amid repeated assertions by former U.S. President Donald Trump since 2019 that the U.S. should acquire Greenland for strategic, national security, and resource access reasons, citing advantages in the Arctic over China and Russia. Both Greenlandic and Danish leaders have firmly rejected the idea, calling it absurd and emphasizing that Greenlanders have the right to determine their own future. The U.S. already holds military rights in Greenland under a 1951 treaty, with consent from Denmark and Greenland, and has a military presence on the island.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 11:00 PM\nSource:[NewsMax](https://www.newsmax.com/world/globaltalk/greenland-poll-artic/2026/02/04/id/1244909/)\n\n**76 percent in Greenland oppose becoming part of US: Survey**\nA poll conducted from January 16 to January 28, 2026, among 610 adults in Greenland, found that 76% of respondents oppose the idea of Greenland becoming part of the United States, while only 8% support it and 16% are unsure. The survey, published by the Copenhagen Post and reported by The Hill, was released amid heightened tensions following President Donald Trump's public statements advocating for the U.S. to acquire Greenland for national security reasons, including countering Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic. Sune Steffen Hansen, the survey's lead researcher, stated that Greenlanders are 'quite satisfied' with their current status. The poll also revealed that only 10% of Greenlanders have a 'mainly' or 'very' positive view of the U.S. welfare system, including health care, elder care, and education. Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory, operates a Nordic-style welfare system funded largely by Denmark, which has pledged an additional 1.6 billion Danish crowns ($253 million) for health care and infrastructure through 2029. Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen expressed skepticism that the U.S. would fund such a system, stating, 'You haven't introduced a Scandinavian welfare system in your own country.' Trump initially refused to rule out military force to seize Greenland but later backtracked at the World Economic Forum in Davos, announcing a 'framework of a future deal' with NATO on security and mineral rights and walking back proposed tariffs on European allies. Despite this reversal, 54% of Greenlanders reported being worried or very worried about potential U.S. military deployment. Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen acknowledged ongoing pressure, stating, 'We are under pressure, serious pressure... as Greenland leaders, we have to deal with people who are afraid and scared,' while affirming that Greenland has 'red lines' it cannot cross but remains open to negotiation. The margin of error for the poll is approximately 4.0 percentage points.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 09:47 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5723278-greenland-us-territory-poll/)\n\n**The Greenland Crisis: The Future of Transatlantic Relations in Question**\nIn February 2026, a geopolitical crisis emerged over U.S. President Donald Trump's public declaration of interest in acquiring Greenland, including the possibility of using military force, citing national security concerns. This move constituted the first time the U.S. posed a direct security threat to a NATO ally, prompting Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to invoke Article 5 of the NATO treaty, stating that an attack on Denmark is an attack on all NATO members. In response, eight NATO nations\u2014Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, and Finland\u2014conducted Operation Arctic Endurance in Greenland to counter the perceived threat, leading Trump to threaten tariffs on these countries. The crisis was resolved on February 21, 2026, when Trump announced a framework agreement with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. The agreement preserved Denmark\u2019s sovereignty and the principle of self-determination, meeting two of Denmark\u2019s red lines. Despite U.S. gains in Arctic influence, the crisis revealed structural weaknesses in transatlantic relations. Analyst Chen Wei-hsia argues that the U.S. withdrawal from its role as a provider of public goods\u2014such as security and a rules-based order\u2014has undermined the predictability of the international system. According to realist theory, European nations now face a strategic dilemma: either seek new alliances to rebalance power or maintain reliance on U.S. hegemony. Recent diplomatic actions\u2014such as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s visit to Beijing, French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s China visit, and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s return to China after eight years\u2014suggest a shift toward strategic autonomy. Carney, speaking at the World Economic Forum, advocated for 'realism based on values'\u2014a middle path where middle powers form flexible coalitions based on issue-specific cooperation rather than rigid blocs. This approach aligns with China\u2019s call for multilateralism and the Global South\u2019s aspirations, offering a potential model for future international relations. The crisis underscores the fragility of the postwar liberal order and the urgent need for middle powers to act collectively to preserve stability.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 09:20 PM\nSource:[\u98a8\u50b3\u5a92](https://www.storm.mg/article/11100069)\n\n**Anita Anand to formally open Canadian Consulate in Greenland**\nCanadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand announced her upcoming visit to Nuuk, Greenland, to formally open the Canadian consulate there on February 4, 2026. During her trip, she will meet with Danish and Greenlandic counterparts to reaffirm principles of state sovereignty, territorial integrity, and cooperation among Arctic states, including the Nordic Five. Anand emphasized Canada\u2019s investment of over 80 billion dollars in national defence and security, including Arctic security, stating, 'We will build Canada strong.' The move follows France\u2019s January decision to open a consulate in Nuuk, a strategic step signaling deeper engagement with the territory, which is part of the Kingdom of Denmark. Currently, only Iceland and the United States maintain diplomatic consulates in Nuuk, though several other nations have honorary consuls. The development comes amid heightened international interest in Greenland, particularly after U.S. President Donald Trump claimed on February 4, 2026, that negotiations over Greenland had begun and were close to agreement, calling it a 'very important deal' for national security. According to ANI, Trump stated, 'We have started a negotiation, and I think it's pretty well agreed to... I think we're going to make a deal there.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 01:44 PM\nSource:[Asian News International (ANI)](https://www.aninews.in/news/world/others/anita-anand-to-formally-open-canadian-consulate-in-greenland20260204191117/)\n\n**Inuit Voices in Greenland: Challenging Global Claims Amid Rising Tensions and NATO Deployment**\nIn Nuuk, the capital of Greenland, the cold is not the only thing cutting the air\u2014tensions between local Inuit communities and global powers have turned the island into a geopolitical chessboard. Local artist Mike Fredriksen questions the logic of Denmark\u2019s continued possession of Greenland, asking, 'Why does Denmark want to keep Greenland if Danes don\u2019t want to live here?' He also dismisses Donald Trump\u2019s interest in the island as 'ridiculous,' noting that no American is willing to settle in its extreme conditions. For the 85% of Greenland\u2019s population of Inuit descent, sovereignty remains a distant discussion in distant offices, while they live on the land daily. Meanwhile, a Colombian family visiting from Bogot\u00e1, accustomed to 15\u00b0C winters, expressed astonishment at local resilience\u2014children playing in -8\u00b0C temperatures and communities thriving with modern amenities like cinemas and universities despite the harsh Arctic environment. The human experience contrasts with the growing military presence: a NATO operation excluding the U.S., involving troops from Norway, France, the UK, and the Netherlands, set to last through 2026, aimed at protecting Greenland\u2019s autonomy and securing natural resources exposed by climate change. The operation underscores the island\u2019s strategic importance amid rising global ambitions over Arctic territory.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 08:50 AM\nSource:[Cadena 3 Argentina](https://www.cadena3.com/noticia/cadena-3-en-groenlandia/para-que-quieren-la-isla-si-no-vienen-a-vivir-aqui-el-reclamo-inuit_515781)\n\n**Get the Facts: What makes Greenland so valuable \u2014 and why President Trump is interested**\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed ongoing interest in gaining control of Greenland since 2019, with renewed attention in early 2026. At the 2026 NATO conference in Davos, Trump claimed the U.S. would soon take over Greenland, citing its strategic location between the U.S., Europe, and Russia as critical for national security. He also stated that Greenland is 'essential for the Golden Dome missile shield,' according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The U.S. currently maintains the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland under a 1951 Defense of Greenland agreement with NATO, and since 2020, it has been operated by the U.S. Space Force. Greenland, part of the Kingdom of Denmark but self-governing, has a population of 57,000\u201488% of whom are Greenlandic\u2014and covers 836,300 square miles, larger than Texas, California, Montana, New Mexico, and Arizona combined. Despite its sparse population and icy terrain, Greenland is rich in natural resources including lithium, gold, zinc, diamonds, oil, and gas. A 2025 poll found that 85% of Greenlanders oppose joining the U.S., while a majority support independence. The Danish and Greenlandic governments strongly oppose any shift in sovereignty. In response to opposition, Trump canceled new tariffs on eight European nations scheduled for February 1, 2026. A proposed compromise discussed among NATO members involves Denmark and the alliance working with the U.S. to build additional U.S. military bases on Greenland. The White House claims such a deal would achieve U.S. strategic goals at minimal long-term cost.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 08:05 PM\nSource:[ketv.com](https://www.ketv.com/article/greenland-trump-explainer/70097863)\n\n**Trump\u2019s Greenland Proposal Sparks Political Firestorm: Sovereignty, Strategy, and Strategic Resources at Stake**\nGreenland is experiencing heightened political tension following renewed remarks by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who expressed interest in purchasing the island, reigniting long-standing fears among its population about sovereignty and identity. The island, the world\u2019s largest, has become a focal point in U.S. national security strategy, challenging Denmark\u2019s historical sovereignty. Indigenous Inuit communities, whose political parties broadly support independence from Denmark, now view Trump\u2019s proposal as a more immediate threat than Danish governance. A Greenlandic woman expressed concern over the future of her children, stating, 'We hope our children\u2019s future is in the Greenland we know today.' Danish national J. Kildsen protested alone outside the U.S. consulate for days, declaring, 'We will resist and respond\u2014we will not be taken by force.' While widespread opposition exists, some Greenlanders, like construction worker J\u00f8rgen Poulsen, support the U.S. proposal, arguing Denmark has neglected the island for decades and that U.S. protection would ensure security and cultural relevance. Greenland\u2019s geographic location in North America, proximity to New York (closer than Copenhagen), and strategic military value\u2014particularly as a potential site for the U.S. 'Golden Dome' missile defense system\u2014amplify its importance. Melting ice is opening new shipping routes, increasing geopolitical competition. Greenland is rich in strategic minerals including uranium, iron, zinc, graphite, and rare earth elements critical for advanced technologies like missiles, fighter jets, smartphones, electric vehicles, wind turbines, and semiconductors. These resources place Greenland at the center of a new global 'game' driven by AI, biotechnology, and quantum computing, explaining Trump\u2019s strategic interest in securing energy, supply chains, and denying rivals access.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 01:01 PM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2026/2/3/%d8%b9%d8%a7%d8%b5%d9%81%d8%a9-%d8%aa%d8%b1%d9%85%d8%a8-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%b3%d9%8a%d8%a7%d8%b3%d9%8a%d8%a9-%d8%aa%d8%b6%d8%b9-%d8%ba%d8%b1%d9%8a%d9%86%d9%84%d8%a7%d9%86%d8%af-%d8%b9%d9%84%d9%89)\n\n**Gov. Gen.

Speaking on February 3, 2026, Simon emphasized that decisions about Greenland\u2019s future must be made by its people, not by foreign leaders such as former U.S. President Donald Trump, who had previously threatened to buy or take control of the island. Simon, a respected advocate for northern Indigenous communities, described Greenlanders as 'relatives who live in faraway lands,' referencing her childhood memories of hearing Greenlandic songs via her grandmother\u2019s shortwave radio. Greenlandic Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt echoed the stance, stating 'Greenland is not for sale,' and noted that while diplomatic talks have improved, tensions remain. Simon highlighted the importance of preserving Indigenous connections across the Arctic amid rising geopolitical competition, especially as global demand grows for rare earths, critical minerals, and new Arctic shipping routes. She called for renewed international cooperation in the region, noting that the Arctic has historically been a low-tension zone, though this is now challenged by Russia\u2019s absence from the Arctic Council since 2022. Canada and France are both establishing consulates in Nuuk, Greenland, a symbolic gesture of support for the island\u2019s 57,000 Inuit residents.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 12:44 PM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.thestar.com/politics/federal/gov-gen-mary-simon-is-elbows-up-for-greenland-ahead-of-arctic-visit/article_c849c964-3736-4aca-ae72-46fb581181ff.html)\n\n**'We all live with constant uncertainty': Donald Trump still wants to take over Greenland, prime minister warns**\nGreenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen warned on February 3, 2026, that despite Donald Trump's public withdrawal from threats of military force, the United States continues to pursue control over Greenland, driven by strategic concerns related to Russia and China. Trump had previously intensified calls for U.S. acquisition of the Arctic island at the start of 2026, prompting concern among European NATO allies who reaffirmed Denmark's sovereignty over Greenland and warned of potential alliance fractures. Although Trump claimed to have secured 'total U.S. access to Greenland' through a NATO agreement, details remain undisclosed. Nielsen stated in a speech to Greenland\u2019s parliament in Nuuk\u2014delivered via translator\u2014that the U.S. view of Greenland has not changed: it remains aimed at tying the island to American governance. He emphasized that Greenland seeks 'paths to ownership and control' and condemned the resulting 'constant uncertainty' affecting the population, noting 'some of our compatriots have severe sleep problems, children feel the worry and anxiety of adults,' and calling the situation 'completely unacceptable.' A recent survey on Greenlanders' mental health was launched amid this pressure. Diplomatic talks involving senior officials from the U.S., Denmark, and Greenland began the previous week to address American security concerns in the Arctic while respecting Denmark\u2019s 'red lines.' Nielsen previously stated that if forced to choose, Greenlanders would opt for Denmark. The debate also intersects with Inuit cultural values, as Greenlandic law reflects collective land stewardship\u2014people may own homes but not the land beneath them\u2014contrasting with Western notions of private land ownership.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 05:35 AM\nSource:[Irish Independent](https://www.independent.ie/world-news/north-america/we-all-live-with-constant-uncertainty-donald-trump-still-wants-to-take-over-greenland-prime-minister-warns/a1010500736.html)\n\n**Greenland's Premier Rejects U.S. Overtures: 'Greenland Is Our Children's Heritage'**\nPremier of Greenland, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, stated unequivocally that Greenland is 'the heritage of our children, and cannot be bought or sold,' rejecting U.S. interest in gaining control over the territory. He emphasized that the United States continues to seek ways to assume ownership and governance of Greenland, citing recent attempts to transfer control to the military, which were rejected but whose underlying intent remains unchanged. Nielsen condemned the idea as 'completely unacceptable' and reaffirmed Greenland\u2019s sovereignty as part of the Kingdom of Denmark within NATO. He expressed concern over the psychological impact on Greenlanders, noting that some citizens suffer from sleep issues and children experience anxiety typically seen in adults. He warned that if international rules\u2014especially state borders and national sovereignty\u2014are not respected, great powers risk dividing the world, undermining freedom and self-determination. The comments follow statements by former U.S. President Donald Trump in January 2026, who said the U.S. would 'have everything we want' and was engaged in 'interesting talks' about acquiring Greenland, though he denied plans to use military force. Trump previously argued that U.S. control would prevent Russian and Chinese influence. NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte echoed these concerns in January 2026, stating that China has become de facto an Arctic power due to its extensive activities, despite not being a geographical Arctic state. He noted that seven Arctic nations are NATO members, and since 2025, NATO has increased its engagement in the Arctic region at the request of seven Arctic-bordering allies.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 07:49 PM\nSource:[gazetapl](https://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/swiat/7,198075,32573289,premier-grenlandii-nie-ma-zludzen-co-do-planow-usa-szukaja.html)\n\n**Canadian and Danish Prime Ministers Support Greenland's Sovereignty**\nCanadian Prime Minister Mark Carney and Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen affirmed in a phone conversation that only the residents of Greenland and Denmark have the right to decide Greenland's future. According to a press release from the Canadian government, both leaders reiterated their commitment to the principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity, emphasizing that Greenland's fate must be determined exclusively by its own people and the Danish population. They also discussed strengthening security in the Arctic, both within and beyond NATO, with Carney highlighting prospects for deeper cooperation with Baltic and Nordic states. Meanwhile, U.S. President Donald Trump announced on January 31, 2026, that negotiations regarding Greenland's future had begun, expressing confidence in a favorable outcome for both the U.S. and Europe. Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to annex Greenland, having previously proposed purchasing it during his first term and asserting in March 2025 his belief in the possibility of its annexation. Currently, Greenland holds autonomous status within the Kingdom of Denmark. In 1951, the U.S. and Denmark signed a defense treaty under NATO, obligating the U.S. to defend Greenland from potential attacks.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 06:52 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0438\u0434\u0443\u0441](https://www.ridus.ru/premer-ministry-kanady-i-danii-podderzhali-suverenitet-grenlandii-782808.html)\n\n**Greenland's President Warns Trump 'Still Wants to Link Us to the U.S. and Control Us From There'**\nJens-Frederik Nielsen, President of the autonomous territory of Greenland, warned on February 2, 2026, that Donald Trump continues to seek control over Greenland, despite rejecting a hypothetical military invasion. Nielsen stated that Trump expressed his desire to control Greenland as early as 2019 and has reiterated it multiple times in the past year. He emphasized that although a military operation has been ruled out, Trump's vision remains unchanged: to link Greenland to the United States and control it from there. Nielsen described Trump's threats as 'unacceptable' and said they have caused 'great insecurity' among Greenlanders. He affirmed that Greenland is part of the Kingdom of Denmark and is developing under its Autonomy Statute, stressing that 'Greenland cannot be bought or sold.' Nielsen, who won elections in 2025 and leads a moderate independence bloc representing three-quarters of the Greenlandic Parliament, highlighted that Greenland is not alone and is protected by international allies. He noted that the issue extends beyond Greenland, affecting the future of NATO, Western security, and global democracy. Trump\u2019s renewed interest in Greenland\u2014citing national security reasons\u2014has triggered a crisis within NATO and with several European countries, prompting threats of tariffs against nations deploying troops to the Arctic island. After meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump claimed to have reached a preliminary agreement satisfying his demands. High-level talks involving U.S., Danish, and Greenlandic officials are ongoing, with Copenhagen and Nuuk both affirming that Greenland\u2019s sovereignty and territorial integrity are not up for negotiation. Nielsen stated that dialogue has begun and that the Greenlandic government (Naalakkersuisut) will work toward concrete outcomes while strengthening cooperation with Western nations, Denmark, and the European Union. Greenland, with a population of under 57,000 across 2.2 million square kilometers (80% permanently ice-covered), has held an Autonomy Statute since 2009, granting it the right to self-determination.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 05:23 PM\nSource:[El Financiero](https://www.elfinanciero.com.mx/mundo/2026/02/02/lider-de-groenlandia-advierte-que-trump-aun-quiere-vincularnos-a-eu-y-controlarnos-desde-alli/)\n\n**Trump still seeks to control Greenland, PM warns**\nGreenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen warned in a speech to the island's parliament in Nuuk on February 2, 2026, that former U.S. President Donald Trump continues to pursue ways to gain control over Greenland, despite having ruled out military force. Nielsen stated that the U.S. still seeks 'paths to ownership and control' over the Arctic island, describing the ongoing pressure as unacceptable and damaging to Greenlanders' mental health. He cited widespread anxiety, sleep problems, and children absorbing adult stress, noting that 'we all live with constant uncertainty about what may happen tomorrow.' The U.S. had previously intensified calls for control citing national security concerns related to Russia and China, prompting concern among European NATO allies about the potential fracture of the alliance.

The agreement, promoted by Donald Trump, allows the U.S. to control designated land for military infrastructure and enhanced Arctic surveillance in response to growing geopolitical influence from China and Russia. The only current U.S. installation in Greenland is the Pituffik Space Base, though the U.S. previously maintained up to 17 bases during the Cold War. The proposed arrangement draws inspiration from the status of British military bases in Cyprus, which operate under sovereign jurisdiction. While the U.S. seeks to deploy components of the future Golden Dome antiballistic system\u2014comprising sensors and platforms for missile detection and interception\u2014Dinamarca and Greenland remain cautious, with Copenhagen rejecting any cession of sovereignty. Greenland\u2019s Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, stated, 'But we cannot negotiate our sovereignty.' In Nuuk, public reaction was skeptical, with residents calling Trump\u2019s promises 'lies' and expressing distrust in Washington. Greenland\u2019s deputy MP Aaja Chemnitz emphasized that the NATO cannot make agreements on Greenland without involving local authorities. Greenland\u2019s estimated 1.5 million tons of rare earth minerals attract investment, but harsh climate and ice limit exploitation.

Trump had threatened to impose new tariffs on these nations for opposing U.S. control over Greenland, with a 10% tariff set to take effect on February 1, 2026, potentially rising to 25% by June 1, 2026. The countries emphasized that their military deployment to Greenland, alongside Slovenia, as part of the Danish-led Arctic Endurance exercise under NATO, is not a threat but a measure to strengthen Arctic security. In a joint statement, they affirmed their commitment to sovereignty and territorial integrity, stating that Trump\u2019s intimidation tactics harm transatlantic relations and risk triggering a dangerous downward spiral.

The piece outlines a 21st-century model of 'geo-osmosis'\u2014a non-traditional, soft territorial expansion through functional penetration via infrastructure investment, contractors, legal gray zones, and strategic dependency. In this scenario, the U.S. government channels $1 billion in 'strategic development' funds through allied NGOs, consulting firms, and disaster response teams, targeting isolated communities in Greenland. These efforts, while appearing humanitarian, create economic dependency and shift political allegiance. Over time, U.S. influence reshapes governance: Danish supply lines are disrupted, local officials are courted, media is influenced, and a pro-American 'Sovereignty Future Caucus' emerges. By 2027, Greenland is in a 'sovereignty twilight'\u2014formally part of Denmark but functionally dependent on the U.S. The U.S. avoids a referendum, instead leveraging a 'temporary autonomy' declaration and a letter from pro-American officials to justify deploying military forces. The U.S. then negotiates a free association agreement, assuming full defense and security, and declares Greenland a 'special economic zone.' Denmark and the EU condemn the move, but lack the leverage to act. The piece concludes that the scenario exemplifies a new era of sovereignty where control is achieved not through force but through systemic dependency, with long-term implications for international law and the erosion of self-determination. The article explicitly states this is speculative fiction intended to provoke reflection and prevent such outcomes.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 17, 2026 04:01 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8pz5V6pgEFu)\n\n**Greenland as the 51st U.S. State: How It Will Happen**\nThe Greenland crisis of 2026 has exposed the shift in U.S. foreign policy, transforming Greenland from a NATO ally into a 'strategic asset.' According to EADaily, citing Pravda.Ru, the U.S. has abandoned diplomatic norms in favor of the MAGA ideology espoused by Steve Miller and Donald Trump, asserting that international law is for the weak and that power is determined by military strength. The article claims that the U.S. is pursuing a plan to annex Greenland, using national security and the 'Golden Dome' missile defense project as justification. The European response, including Operation 'Arctic Resilience,' is dismissed as ineffective\u201440 soldiers across two million square kilometers is portrayed as symbolic, not strategic. The article argues that any real escalation would lead to the rapid neutralization of allied forces by superior U.S. technology, with European special forces evacuated as 'victims of harsh conditions.' It warns that economic pressure\u2014freezing Danish assets and imposing financial collapse\u2014would force Greenland into a U.S.-led referendum, offering each of its 56,000 residents $3\u20135 million to accept U.S. partnership. The article concludes that the U.S. no longer negotiates but takes by force, marking the end of the alliance era, where sovereignty now depends solely on military capability.

The scenario, intended to prevent a catastrophic outcome, envisions the U.S. establishing de facto control over Greenland by 2028 through economic and political influence rather than military force. Shapiro describes this process as 'geo-osmosis'\u2014a 'new form of 21st-century imperialism'\u2014where sovereignty is achieved without violence. The U.S. would launch the 'Northern Strategic Reallocation Initiative' in May 2026, allocating $10 billion to modernize Greenland\u2019s infrastructure and exploit its natural resources. Projects would be carried out by private consortia in exchange for binding local agreements, creating functional dependence on Washington while Greenland formally remains part of Denmark. Although most Greenlanders oppose U.S. annexation, some local politicians may agree due to frustration with Danish paternalism and budget constraints. By October 2027, Greenland\u2019s parliament could declare a temporary autonomy and a 'transitional sovereignty period.' The U.S. would then open military-civilian coordination centers in Nuuk and three other cities, followed by a proposal for a Compact of Free Association (COFA), similar to agreements with Pacific island nations. Denmark would protest, recalling its ambassador to Washington, and the EU would condemn the U.S. for violating international law, though it would take no action beyond monitoring. China and Russia may view the U.S. actions as a precedent. Trump previously expressed interest in purchasing Greenland during his first term, an offer rejected by both Denmark and Greenland, with the latter stating, 'Greenland is not for sale.' After his return to office, Trump reiterated that the U.S. should own Greenland, claiming it is 'surrounded' by Russian and Chinese fleets.

Miller publicly questioned Denmark\u2019s sovereignty over Greenland and asserted that 'Greenland should be part of the United States,' escalating tensions. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who had previously attempted quiet diplomacy, was reportedly 'visibly frazzled' by the remarks. European leaders, including French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot and EU President Ursula von der Leyen, expressed strong opposition to any forcible takeover, with Barrot stating, 'Greenland is not for sale, nor is it for the taking,' and referencing the 1803 Louisiana Purchase as a historical analogy. The European Union, while not united on a response, has pursued diplomatic avenues: offering potential economic incentives, proposing enhanced NATO military presence in Greenland to counter Chinese and Russian influence, and discussing Greenland\u2019s mineral resources as a bargaining chip. One idea under consideration is altering Greenland\u2019s legal status to allow U.S. operational access without formal ownership. Denmark\u2019s Defense Ministry has warned that any invasion would be met with immediate resistance. Despite the lack of evidence of an imminent invasion, European officials are working behind the scenes to avoid confrontation through negotiation, balancing the need for U.S. cooperation on Ukraine with the imperative to defend sovereignty. The North Atlantic Council met in Brussels to discuss options, and diplomatic efforts continue, including high-level talks between U.S. lawmakers and Danish officials.

The statement, issued collectively by party leaders, declared, 'We do not want to become American, nor Danish. We simply want to remain Greenlanders.'

Miller asserted that the U.S. has a 'formal position' that Greenland should become part of the United States, questioning Denmark's right to control the Arctic island and claiming that Greenland's status as a Danish territory lacks a solid legal basis. He emphasized that the U.S., as the dominant power in NATO, must secure the Arctic region for NATO's interests, thereby justifying Greenland's inclusion in the U.S. When asked if military force might be used, Miller said, 'Nobody is going to fight militarily against the U.S. for the future of Greenland.' This statement followed Trump's renewed call for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, citing national security concerns and the presence of Russian and Chinese vessels in the region. In response, leaders from six European nations\u2014Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the UK\u2014issued a joint declaration affirming Greenland's sovereignty, stating, 'Greenland belongs to its people,' and emphasizing that only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning them. The Danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, warned that a U.S. annexation would end the NATO alliance. Greenland's Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, condemned Trump\u2019s 'fantasies of annexation' as 'completely unacceptable.' Greenland has been under Danish control since the 18th century, gained self-rule in 1979, and retains Danish oversight of foreign and security policy. The island is rich in rare earth minerals critical for advanced technologies.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 06, 2026 08:00 PM\nSource:[euronews](http://pt.euronews.com/2026/01/06/stephen-miller-diz-que-ninguem-lutaria-contra-os-eua-pelo-futuro-da-gronelandia)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
