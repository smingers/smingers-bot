It does not contain traditional news reporting, facts, or expert opinions, but rather reflects crowd-sourced probability estimates from market participants.\n\n## Key Information:\n\n**Primary Market Displayed:**\n- Question: \"Will Greenland be a sovereign state before 2040?\"\n- Current probability: 13% chance (Note: The display shows \"13 \u1e40130\u1e402602040 31% chance\" which appears to contain formatting/display issues, but indicates a probability in the 13-31% range)\n\n**Resolution Criteria for the Primary Market:**\n- Resolves YES if Greenland joins the UN as a sovereign state\n- Resolves YES if Greenland is self-declared sovereign with >90% international recognition\n- Resolves as percentage if Greenland is self-declared sovereign with <90% international recognition\n\n**Related Markets Listed (with probability estimates):**\n- US acquires part of Greenland in 2026: 19% chance\n- Greenland becomes independent from Denmark before 2030: 20% chance\n- US acquires or gains sovereignty over any part of Greenland by March 31, 2026: 8% chance\n- Greenland becomes EU member before 2040: 41% chance\n- Greenland leaves Kingdom of Denmark before 2032: 25% chance\n- Greenland becomes part of US by end of Trump's term: 5% chance\n- USA acquires Greenland by Dec. 31 2026: 11% chance\n- If Greenland Polymarket resolves YES, will Greenland be the 51st state by 2030: 12% chance\n\nThese probabilities represent market participants' aggregated beliefs about various Greenland-related outcomes, but do not constitute expert analysis or factual reporting.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.thearcticinstitute.org/trump-greenland-logic-chaos/\">\n# Summary of \"Trump & Greenland: Is There Logic in the Chaos?\"\n\n**Source:** The Arctic Institute - Center for Circumpolar Security Studies  \n**Date:** January 8, 2026  \n**Author:** Andreas \u00d8sthagen\n\n## Key Facts and Analysis:\n\n### Economic/Resource Motivations:\n- Greenland has large proven resources and several active mines extracting minerals\n- Trump is reportedly driven by desire for economic gain through giving American companies special access to deals\n- **Rumor:** An Australian geologist made Trump aware of Greenland's resource potential in 2019\n- **Author's assessment:** The US does not need sovereignty over Greenland to access resources; companies (not \"the US\") extract resources\n- Alaska also has great untapped mineral potential\n\n### Possible Concessions (Author's Speculation):\n- Denmark/Greenland might release more areas for mining, potentially in conflict with Greenlandic interests\n- American companies could be prioritized in cooperation with Greenlandic ones\n- **Author notes:** This would violate competition rules and Greenland's right to self-determination\n\n### Strategic/Military Context:\n- Russia's strategic nuclear weapons are mostly located on the Kola Peninsula (near Norway), not near Greenland\n- US already has Pituffik military base in northwest Greenland where US Space Force monitors potential Russian threats\n- Russian naval vessels sail in the Barents Sea, not around Greenland\n- Chinese ships mainly sail to/from Russia and outside Alaska, not around Greenland\n- Chinese investment projects in Greenland have been put on hold for security reasons\n\n### Existing Danish Commitments:\n- Copenhagen has promised to invest **over $6 billion USD** in defense capabilities in Greenland\n- Denmark will purchase more F-35 fighter jets and P-8 surveillance aircraft from the United States\n- **Author's assessment:** This will \"probably not be enough\"\n\n### Additional Possible Concessions (Author's Speculation):\n- A new Danish and/or American base might need to be built on Greenland\n- A symbolic defense agreement where the US officially becomes responsible for Greenland's defense\n- Denmark sending frigates and fighter jets to Alaska for exercises\n\n### Trump's Geopolitical Framework:\n- Trump referenced the **Monroe Doctrine** (1823) at a January 4 press conference\n- Author interprets this as \"19th century great power politics\" where the most powerful nation controls its immediate vicinity\n- Author compares this to Russia wanting control over Estonia, Ukraine, Moldova and China over Vietnam, Mongolia, Taiwan\n- Trump met Putin in Alaska in **August 2025**, discussing economic cooperation projects in the Arctic\n\n### Author's Concerns:\n- This approach represents a \"zero-sum game\" mindset that contrasts with modern international norms\n- Bad news for Denmark if this becomes US guideline\n- Could set precedent for other territorial claims (e.g., Russia over Svalbard)\n\n**Note:** This article is an opinion/analysis piece by a named expert. The author's assessments about what concessions \"might\" be needed and speculation about Trump's motivations should be treated as expert opinion rather than confirmed facts.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/22/denmark-pm-calls-for-constructive-greenland-negotiation-with-trump\">\n# Summary of Guardian Article: \"Greenland says red lines must be respected as Trump says US will have 'total' access to island\"\n\n**Date:** January 22, 2026  \n**Source:** The Guardian  \n**Author:** Jon Henley\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n### Greenland's Position:\n- **Jens-Frederik Nielsen** (Greenland's Prime Minister) stated that Greenland's sovereignty is non-negotiable\n- Nielsen emphasized \"red lines\" including territorial integrity, international law, and sovereignty must be respected\n- He stated: \"If Greenlanders had to choose, we choose the Kingdom of Denmark, we choose the EU, we choose Nato\"\n- Nielsen clarified that \"Nobody other than Greenland and the Kingdom of Denmark have the mandate to make deals or agreements about Greenland\"\n\n### Trump Administration Claims:\n- Trump claimed an agreement with NATO would give the US \"total access\" to Greenland with \"no end, no time limit\"\n- Trump described this as the \"framework of a future deal\"\n- **JD Vance** (US Vice President) said negotiations with NATO were \"going fine\" and stated Greenland matters because \"our entire missile defence relies on security in the Arctic\"\n- Trump backed away from his threat to use tariffs and ruled out the use of force (as of Wednesday, day before this article)\n\n### Denmark's Stance:\n- **Mette Frederiksen** (Danish Prime Minister) emphasized Denmark's sovereignty \"cannot be discussed, it cannot be changed\"\n- She stated NATO states backed having a \"permanent presence\" in the Arctic, including around Greenland\n- Frederiksen said Denmark wishes to continue dialogue \"provided this is done with respect for our territorial integrity\"\n\n### NATO's Role:\n- **Mark Rutte** (NATO Secretary General) said he had a \"very good discussion\" with Trump about bolstering Arctic security\n- Rutte told Reuters that NATO senior commanders would \"work out what is necessary\" and hoped this could be done \"early in 2026\"\n- One workstream is to \"ensure that the Chinese and the Russians will not gain access to the Greenland economy [or] militarily to Greenland\"\n- **Gen Alexus Grynkewich** (NATO's top military commander in Europe) said no planning has started but they're \"ready\"\n\n### European Reaction:\n- **Kaja Kallas** (EU foreign policy chief) said transatlantic relations \"have definitely taken a big blow over the last week\"\n- **Friedrich Merz** (German Chancellor) welcomed Trump's change of heart, expressing gratitude that Trump \"distanced himself from his original plans to take over Greenland\"\n- **Emmanuel Macron** said Europe needed to \"remain extremely vigilant\"\n- **Teresa Ribera** (European Commission executive vice-president) warned: \"Silence is too ambiguous, too dangerous\"\n- An unnamed European diplomat stated: \"EU firmness and unity have contributed to get him to change his position\"\n\n### Background Context:\n- Trump had threatened to impose a 10% tariff on imports from Denmark, France, Germany, Sweden, the UK, the Netherlands and Finland unless they dropped objections to his Greenland plans\n- EU had considered retaliatory action including tariffs on \u20ac93 billion (\u00a380 billion) of US imports\n- The US already has a military base on Greenland and a bilateral agreement with Denmark allowing expansion of its presence\n\n### Less Reliable/Unnamed Sources:\n- An unnamed European diplomat attributed Trump's position change to \"EU firmness and unity,\" \"internal political pressure in the US, and market reaction\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/5/trump-tempers-criticism-of-uks-chagos-islands-deal-after-talk-with-starmer\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Trump tempers criticism of UK's Chagos Islands deal after talk with Starmer\"\n\n**Key Facts:**\n\n1. **Trump's Position Shift**: US President Donald Trump appears to have endorsed the UK's deal to hand over sovereignty of the Chagos Islands to Mauritius, after previously calling it a \"great stupidity\" last month.\n\n2. **The Deal Details**: Under an agreement from May (last year), the UK and Mauritius announced that full sovereignty of the Chagos archipelago (more than 60 islands) would transfer to Mauritius, in exchange for guarantees that the US military base on Diego Garcia could continue operating for the next 99 years.\n\n3. **Trump-Starmer Talks**: Trump held talks with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer on Thursday and stated Starmer had made the \"best deal he could make.\"\n\n4. **US Military Assurances**: Trump warned in a Truth Social post that the US would retain the right to \"militarily secure and reinforce\" the US presence on Diego Garcia if threatened.\n\n5. **Official Statement**: The British government stated that \"the leaders agreed their governments would continue working closely to guarantee the future operation of the base and speak again soon.\"\n\n**Historical Context Provided:**\n\n- The Chagos Islands have been under British control since 1814\n- In the 1960s and 1970s, Britain forcibly evicted nearly 2,000 locals to make way for the US military base\n- The base played a pivotal role in US military operations in Vietnam, Iraq, and Afghanistan\n- In 2008, the US acknowledged the base had been used for covert rendition flights of \"terrorism\" suspects\n\n**Relevance to Greenland Question**: While this article discusses a different territorial sovereignty issue (Chagos Islands, not Greenland), it provides context on Trump's recent approach to territorial sovereignty negotiations involving US military interests.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Fetch time series of community prediction for Metaculus question 41502 over last 3 months, list significant daily changes with dates, correlate with major Greenland-US sovereignty news, and give current community prediction and number of forecasters.\nThe fresh search round reconfirms the core finding from the prior memo: virtually all machine-readable data needed to satisfy the four deliverables for Metaculus question 41502 remain behind an authenticated wall.\n\n1. Where the 90-day time series ought to live  \n   \u2022 The Ergo and forecasting-tools Python wrappers both expose the attribute question.prediction_timeseries, so Metaculus clearly stores a JSON array of dated community predictions.  \n   \u2022 Nothing in the open-source code points to a public, token-free REST path.  All wrapper examples load an environment variable called METACULUS_TOKEN before they can access either the \u201ctimeseries\u201d or \u201ccommunity_prediction\u201d fields (GitHub \u2013 Metaculus/forecasting-tools).  \n   \u2022 No Google result revealed a URL such as /api2/questions/41502/timeseries, nor did we locate a GraphQL endpoint.  Hence, the historic series is effectively private unless an authenticated call is made.\n\n2. Current snapshot (community probability + number of forecasters)  \n   \u2022 The canonical endpoint /api2/questions/{id} does include community_prediction and num_forecasters in other questions that are publicly scraped, but no anonymously accessible JSON for id 41502 surfaced in search, so the current values remain unknown.  \n   \u2022 Again, the absence of a token appears to be the blocking factor.\n\n3. Greenland\u2013U.S. sovereignty news in the last three months  \n   Two genuinely sovereignty-related news spikes stand out and are the only ones located in global coverage:  \n     \u2013 7 Jan 2026: White House press secretary says \u201cacquiring Greenland \u2026 nothing off the table, including force.\u201d (multiple mainstream outlets, summarised in earlier memo).  \n     \u2013 22 Jan 2026: President Trump in Davos claims a \u201cframework of a future deal\u201d giving the U.S. \u201call the military access we want\u201d to Greenland; Denmark immediately reiterates that sovereignty is non-negotiable (BBC, 22 Jan 2026; Military.com, 22 Jan 2026; FactCheck.org, 22 Jan 2026).  \n   No other sovereignty-specific headlines dated February or March 2026 were returned.\n\n4. Ability to list \u201csignificant daily changes\u201d  \n   \u2022 Because the historic prediction series is still inaccessible, we cannot compute day-over-day deltas or identify >5 percentage-point moves.  \n   \u2022 Therefore we cannot test whether either the 7 Jan or 22 Jan news bursts coincided with sharp forecast changes.\n\n5. Technical status confirmed  \n   \u2022 All third-party code examples (Ergo, forecasting-tools) explicitly require METACULUS_TOKEN.  \n   \u2022 No public endpoint for prediction_timeseries is discoverable.  \n   \u2022 Manual scraping via the browser is theoretically possible\u2014one could open the interactive chart on Metaculus while logged in and copy the underlying JSON from DevTools\u2014but that still presupposes an authenticated session.\n\nRemaining information gaps  \nA. Authenticated pull of prediction_timeseries for question 41502 covering at least the last 90 days.  \nB. One snapshot pull of /api2/questions/41502 to obtain current community_prediction and num_forecasters.  \nC. Once A is fulfilled, apply a delta filter (e.g., absolute daily change \u2265 5 pp) and list the dates.  \nD. Line up those dates with the two known news spikes (7 Jan 2026 and 22 Jan 2026) to provide the requested correlation analysis.\n\nConclusion  \nAll four deliverables\u2014(i) 90-day series, (ii) significant daily-change log, (iii) correlation with sovereignty news, (iv) current probability & forecaster count\u2014remain blocked by the same two data gaps (A and B).  The only viable next step is an authenticated API request or a manual export performed while logged in.  Without that, no further progress can be made from open-web sources alone.</Agent_report>\n"
