## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE:**

1. **Consecutive 5-day decline of -10.72% (Multiple sources: GuruFocus, Agent Report)**
   - Establishes severe oversold condition entering baseline date
   - Historical mean reversion: 55-60% probability of bounce after such declines
   - Causal mechanism: Technical support levels activate buying interest
   - **Direction**: Bullish for 6-day window

2. **Technical oversold indicators (Parameter, Benzinga, Agent Report)**
   - RSI in low 30s (oversold territory)
   - Trading at/near 200-day MA support ($168)
   - 19% below 52-week high
   - **Direction**: Bullish (mean reversion setup)

3. **Memory supply constraints affecting production (80.lv, GuruFocus, NVDA official statement)**
   - First GPU launch delay in 30 years
   - RTX 50 production cuts
   - Official NVDA acknowledgment: "memory supply is constrained"
   - **Direction**: Bearish (structural constraint, not quickly resolved)

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**

4. **After-hours positive response to Alphabet capex (Barchart, Anue)**
   - NVDA rose 1.5-2% after-hours on Feb 4-5 following GOOG's $175-185B capex announcement
   - Logical causal link: Higher capex → more GPU purchases
   - **Direction**: Bullish (sector tailwind)

5. **Regulatory uncertainty on H200 exports (Parameter, Anue, Stockpulse)**
   - Commerce approval granted but NVDA hasn't accepted terms
   - Ongoing negotiations with no clear timeline
   - **Direction**: Neutral to slightly bearish (overhang until resolved)

6. **Macro catalysts within window (Agent Report)**
   - Jan employment report: Feb 11
   - Jan CPI: Feb 13
   - Historical pattern: Economic data can drive 2-3% single-day moves in tech
   - **Direction**: Uncertain (50/50 positive vs negative surprise)

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

7. **Jensen Huang dismissing AI replacement concerns (Stockpulse)**
   - CEO statement counters Anthropic narrative
   - But single statement vs market-wide concern
   - **Direction**: Mildly bullish (sentiment stabilization)

8. **Analyst price targets $240-275 (Benzinga, Motley Fool)**
   - Long-term targets, not specific to 6-day window
   - **Direction**: Mildly bullish (institutional confidence)

9. **China H200 orders (Parameter)**
   - 400,000+ chips ordered, 2M+ total demand
   - But shipment timing uncertain, regulatory approval pending
   - **Direction**: Mildly bullish (demand validation)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 6 trading days (Feb 6 → Feb 14, 2026)

**If Halved (3 trading days, Feb 6 → Feb 10)**:
- Probability would decrease to ~48%
- Rationale: Less time for mean reversion bounce to materialize; Feb 11 jobs report excluded; momentum effects dominate shorter windows
- Strong 5-day decline creates inertia that takes time to reverse

**If Doubled (12 trading days, Feb 6 → Feb 24)**:
- Probability would increase to ~58%
- Rationale: More time for oversold bounce; includes both macro catalysts (jobs + CPI); approaches Feb 25 earnings (pre-earnings drift often bullish); mean reversion has higher probability over longer periods

**Key Temporal Factors**:
- **Days 1-3 (Feb 6-10)**: Technical bounce potential vs momentum continuation
- **Day 4 (Feb 11)**: Jobs report binary event
- **Day 5 (Feb 13)**: CPI report binary event  
- **Day 6 (Feb 14)**: Resolution; any late-week positioning effects

The 6-day window is long enough for technical bounce but short enough that macro surprises could dominate. Two major data releases increase variance.

## (d) Justification

**Integration with Outside View (52% base rate)**:

**Factors Supporting Upward Adjustment (+8-10%)**:
1. **Severe oversold condition**: -10.72% in 5 days is extreme; historical mean reversion after such declines is 55-60%, already embedded in base rate but deserves emphasis
2. **After-hours recovery signal**: +1.5-2% bounces on Feb 4-5 evenings show buying interest at these levels
3. **Technical support**: 200-day MA at $168, current price $171.88-$177.74 range; support levels often hold
4. **Alphabet capex catalyst**: $175-185B spending announcement directly benefits NVDA's core business
5. **Short-term analyst models**: AI models targeting $196-199 by Feb 28 implies ~2-3% gain over 6 days

**Factors Supporting Downward Adjustment (-5-7%)**:
1. **Production constraints**: Memory shortage is structural, not quickly resolved; first GPU delay in 30 years signals serious issue
2. **Sector rotation**: Feb 2 market data shows NVDA declining even as S&P 500 rallied; large-cap tech out of favor
3. **Regulatory overhang**: H200 export uncertainty creates ceiling on upside until resolved
4. **Macro uncertainty**: Two major data releases (jobs, CPI) with 50/50 directional probability
5. **No company-specific positive catalyst**: No earnings, no product launch, no major partnership announcement in window

**Net Adjustment**: +3-5% from 52% base rate

**Critical Consideration**: The question requires Feb 14 close > Feb 6 close. Given:
- Starting from deeply oversold position (strongest factor)
- Two macro events that could go either way (adds uncertainty)
- Positive after-hours signals showing demand at current levels
- But structural production issues and sector weakness

The evidence suggests slightly better than coin-flip odds due to mean reversion, but not high confidence given macro risks.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from 52% outside view base rate:

**Upward adjustments**:
- Oversold bounce potential: +3%
- After-hours buying signals: +2%
- Technical support levels: +1%
- Alphabet capex positive: +1%

**Downward adjustments**:
- Production constraint overhang: -2%
- Sector rotation headwinds: -1%
- Macro event uncertainty: -1%

**Net calibration**: 52% + 7% - 4% = **55%**

**Confidence check**: 
- 55% implies 11:9 odds in favor of upward move
- This reflects: slightly better than coin flip due to oversold bounce, but acknowledging significant uncertainty from macro events and structural constraints
- Not confident enough for 60%+ (would need clearer positive catalyst)
- Not pessimistic enough for <50% (oversold condition too severe to ignore)

**Sensitivity analysis**:
- If jobs/CPI both positive: probability jumps to 70-75%
- If jobs/CPI both negative: probability drops to 35-40%
- If H200 approval announced: adds +5-7%
- If further production issues emerge: subtracts -5-7%

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will NVDA's closing price on Feb 14, 2026 exceed its closing price on Feb 6, 2026? (6 trading days)

2. **Base rate alignment**: 52% base rate from mean reversion after sharp declines; final 55% stays close with modest upward adjustment for oversold technicals

3. **Consistency**: "55 out of 100 times, NVDA closes higher on Feb 14 than Feb 6" - Yes, this reflects slight edge for bounce but acknowledges high uncertainty

4. **Key evidence**:
   - -10.72% decline in prior 5 days creates oversold bounce setup (STRONG, bullish)
   - RSI low 30s, trading at 200-day MA support (STRONG, bullish)
   - Memory supply constraints causing production delays (STRONG, bearish)
   - After-hours +1.5-2% bounces show buying interest (MODERATE, bullish)
   - Two macro events (jobs, CPI) with uncertain outcomes (MODERATE, neutral)

5. **Blind spot**: Macro data surprises worse than expected (both jobs and CPI disappoint) + continuation of sector rotation out of large-cap tech. This would make 55% look overconfident; actual probability might be 35-40% in that scenario.

6. **Status quo**: Current price ~$172-178 range. Given recent volatility (-10.72% in 5 days, capable of 3-5% single-day moves), 6-day window has moderate volatility. Slight nudge toward mean reversion (55%) vs pure status quo (50%) is justified by oversold technicals.

Probability: 55%
