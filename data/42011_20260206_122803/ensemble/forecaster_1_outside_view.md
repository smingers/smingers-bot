## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **All 5-trading-day periods for NVDA (2015-present)**
   - Most comprehensive but includes varying market regimes
   - Agent report notes data exists but hasn't been fully processed
   - Would capture full distribution of 5-day returns

2. **5-day periods following significant drawdowns (>5% decline in prior 5 days)**
   - Highly relevant: NVDA just experienced -10.72% in prior 5 days
   - Captures mean-reversion vs. momentum-continuation dynamics
   - More specific to current technical condition

3. **5-day periods in weeks without major company-specific catalysts**
   - Relevant: No NVDA earnings in Feb 6-14 window
   - Would isolate market/sector effects from idiosyncratic events
   - However, macro catalysts (jobs, CPI) still present

4. **5-day periods during high volatility regimes**
   - Recent 5-day swing of -10.72% indicates elevated volatility
   - Current VIX environment matters (not provided in sources)

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: **5-day periods following significant drawdowns (>5% in prior 5 days)** combined with **periods without company-specific earnings catalysts**

This captures:
- Current oversold technical condition
- Absence of NVDA-specific binary events
- Still allows for macro sensitivity (jobs/CPI data)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 6 trading days (Feb 6 → Feb 14, 2026; assuming ~8 calendar days with weekend)

**Key Temporal Factors:**

1. **Starting Condition (Feb 6, 2026)**:
   - NVDA just experienced -10.72% decline over prior 5 days
   - Closed at $187.88 on Feb 5
   - Trading 19% below 52-week high
   - Technical oversold condition

2. **Catalysts Within Window**:
   - Feb 11: January employment report (rescheduled due to government shutdown)
   - Feb 13: January CPI data
   - Potential H200 export license news (timing uncertain)
   - Feb 14: Resolution date (market close)

3. **Historical Context**:
   - Agent report shows short-term AI model targets $196-199 for Feb 28 (~5% above Feb 5 close)
   - This implies analysts expect modest recovery over ~3-week period
   - Pro-rating: ~5% over 15 trading days ≈ 0.33% per day
   - Over 6 trading days: ~2% expected gain

4. **Volatility Pattern**:
   - Recent history shows NVDA capable of large single-day moves (5% intraday on Feb 4)
   - Sector rotation out of large-cap tech creates headwinds
   - But oversold conditions often produce reflexive bounces

## (d) Justification

**Integration of Factors:**

**Bearish Factors:**
1. Strong negative momentum: -10.72% in 5 days immediately preceding baseline
2. Sector headwinds: AI replacement fears, tech rotation
3. Macro uncertainty: Jobs and CPI data could disappoint
4. YTD performance: -7.84% through Feb 5 shows sustained weakness
5. No positive company-specific catalyst scheduled

**Bullish Factors:**
1. Oversold condition: 19% below 52-week high, trading well below historical P/E
2. Analyst targets imply recovery: Short-term models at $196-199 vs $187.88 close
3. Mean reversion tendency after sharp declines
4. Strong fundamental backdrop: 52% consensus revenue growth for FY2027
5. Positive AI infrastructure spending signals (Alphabet capex)
6. Jensen Huang dismissing AI replacement concerns

**Probabilistic Assessment:**

For a 6-day window starting from a significantly oversold position:
- **Base case (no major news)**: Slight mean reversion would favor upward drift
- **Macro data scenarios**: 
  - Positive jobs/CPI (40% probability) → likely +3-5% move
  - Neutral (30% probability) → likely +1-2% move  
  - Negative (30% probability) → likely -2-4% move
- **H200 license approval** (20% probability in window) → +2-3% boost
- **Continued sector weakness** → could override technical bounce

**Historical Pattern**: Following sharp 5-day declines, tech stocks often exhibit:
- 55-60% probability of positive return over next 5 days (mean reversion)
- But distribution is wide with fat tails

**Critical Consideration**: The question asks if Feb 14 close > Feb 6 close. Given:
- Starting from oversold condition
- 6 trading days allows time for bounce
- Two macro catalysts that could go either way
- Analyst models implying modest near-term recovery
- But strong recent downward momentum

The probability should be slightly above 50% due to oversold bounce potential, but tempered by macro uncertainty and lack of company-specific positive catalyst.

## Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring Points:**
1. Agent report's AI model implies ~2% gain over 6 days (from $187.88 toward $196-199 by Feb 28)
2. Random walk baseline: 50% for any directional move
3. Mean reversion after -10.72% decline: historically 55-60% probability of bounce
4. Macro event risk: Could add ±10 percentage points depending on outcomes

**Calibration Considerations:**
- The -10.72% prior decline is substantial and creates technical support for bounce
- However, the Feb 4 Anthropic news shows sector-wide AI concerns persist
- Two major macro events (Feb 11, Feb 13) create significant uncertainty
- No NVDA-specific positive catalyst to drive conviction

**Probability Reasoning:**
- Start with mean reversion baseline: 57%
- Adjust down for macro uncertainty: -5%
- Adjust up for analyst short-term targets: +3%
- Adjust down for sector headwinds: -3%
- Net: ~52%

This reflects:
- Slightly better than coin flip due to oversold bounce potential
- But not confident (>60%) due to macro risks and sector weakness
- Acknowledges significant uncertainty in 6-day window

Outside View Prediction:
52%
