## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **NVDA 5-day returns (all periods since 2015)**
   - Suitability: HIGH - Direct historical precedent
   - Issue: Full distribution not yet calculated in agent report
   - Available data: Recent 5-day return (Jan 29-Feb 5) = -10.72%

2. **NVDA 6-trading-day returns (Feb 6-14 = ~6 trading days)**
   - Suitability: VERY HIGH - Exact timeframe match
   - Issue: Requires historical data extraction

3. **NVDA returns during non-earnings periods**
   - Suitability: HIGH - No earnings catalyst during Feb 6-14
   - Characteristic: Lower volatility than earnings periods

4. **Tech sector 5-day returns during macro uncertainty**
   - Suitability: MEDIUM - Broader but less specific
   - Context: Current rotation out of mega-cap tech

5. **NVDA returns following sharp 5-day declines (-10%+)**
   - Suitability: HIGH - Mean reversion analysis
   - Context: Stock down 10.72% in prior 5 days, oversold

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 6 trading days (Feb 6 close → Feb 14 close)

**Historical Pattern Considerations:**

1. **Volatility Context:**
   - NVDA has experienced high volatility recently (-10.72% in 5 days)
   - Stock is 19% below 52-week high, suggesting oversold conditions
   - YTD performance: -7.84% through Feb 5

2. **Typical 5-6 Day Behavior:**
   - Without full distribution data, I must rely on general knowledge
   - High-beta stocks like NVDA typically show:
     - Mean 5-day return near 0% (slight positive drift)
     - Wide distribution (±5-10% moves common)
     - Slight positive skew in bull markets

3. **Current Market Phase:**
   - Sector rotation OUT of mega-cap tech (early Feb 2026)
   - Multiple negative catalysts just occurred (Feb 2, Feb 4)
   - Technical oversold condition suggests bounce potential

4. **Catalysts in Window:**
   - Feb 11: Employment report (macro risk)
   - Feb 13: CPI data (inflation risk)
   - Potential: H200 license approval (positive)
   - No earnings or product launches scheduled

## (d) Justification

**Baseline Probability Reasoning:**

The question asks whether NVDA will close higher on Feb 14 than Feb 6. This is essentially a coin flip with modifications:

**Base Rate (50%):** In the absence of information, stock prices follow a random walk with slight positive drift.

**Adjustment Factors:**

*Negative Factors (suggesting <50%):*
1. **Recent momentum strongly negative:** -10.72% in prior 5 days, -7.84% YTD
2. **Sector rotation underway:** Multiple sources document tech sell-off in early Feb
3. **Multiple negative catalysts just hit:** OpenAI deal stall (Feb 2), Anthropic fears (Feb 4)
4. **Macro uncertainty:** Two major data releases (employment, CPI) in window could trigger further volatility
5. **Short timeframe:** Only 6 trading days limits recovery potential

*Positive Factors (suggesting >50%):*
1. **Oversold technical condition:** 19% below 52-week high, -10.72% in 5 days suggests mean reversion potential
2. **No negative earnings catalyst:** Earnings not until Feb 25 (after window)
3. **Analyst targets highly bullish:** Mean PT $262.79 vs ~$188 current = +40% upside suggests Street sees value
4. **Short-term AI model targets:** $196-199 by Feb 28 implies ~+5% from Feb 5 close
5. **Positive structural drivers:** Alphabet capex doubling, strong AI infrastructure demand
6. **CEO confidence:** Jensen Huang dismissed AI replacement fears as "illogical"

**Net Assessment:**

The stock has experienced severe technical damage entering Feb 6, with multiple negative catalysts fresh in investors' minds. However, the magnitude of the recent decline (-10.72% in 5 days) is extreme even for NVDA and suggests some oversold bounce is probable.

The 6-day window includes two macro risk events that could extend the sell-off, but also provides time for technical stabilization. The absence of company-specific negative catalysts (no earnings, no product delays) in the window is supportive.

Given:
- Recent extreme weakness creates mean reversion setup
- But momentum is clearly negative entering the period
- Macro risks present but not NVDA-specific
- Analyst targets suggest near-term upside to ~$196-199 range

The probability should be slightly below 50% due to negative momentum, but not dramatically so given oversold conditions and lack of company-specific catalysts.

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring to Available Data:**

1. **Agent report short-term target:** $196-199 by Feb 28 vs $187.88 on Feb 5 = +4.3% to +5.9% over ~3 weeks
   - This suggests modest positive expectation over a longer window than ours
   - Our window (Feb 6-14) is only 6 days vs 23 days to Feb 28
   - Pro-rata: ~1-2% expected gain over 6 days if linear

2. **Recent 5-day performance:** -10.72% (Jan 29-Feb 5)
   - This is an extreme move suggesting exhaustion
   - Mean reversion would favor positive next period

3. **Historical context (general knowledge):**
   - After -10% weekly moves, stocks often show mean reversion
   - But momentum can persist for 1-2 more periods before reversal

4. **Macro calendar risk:**
   - Two major data releases in window increase volatility
   - Could break either direction

**Calibration Logic:**

- Pure random walk: 50%
- Recent momentum penalty: -8% (strong negative trend)
- Oversold bounce premium: +5% (technical reversal setup)
- Analyst confidence premium: +2% (targets suggest upside)
- Macro uncertainty penalty: -3% (employment/CPI risk)

**Net adjustment:** 50% - 8% + 5% + 2% - 3% = 46%

This suggests slightly bearish odds, reflecting that while oversold conditions exist, the negative momentum and macro risks slightly outweigh the bounce potential over such a short 6-day window.

**Confidence Check:**
- 46% implies 46:54 odds (roughly 5:6 against)
- This feels appropriate: more likely to stay weak than bounce strongly
- But close enough to 50% to reflect genuine uncertainty
- Not extreme enough (e.g., 30% or 70%) to suggest high conviction either way
