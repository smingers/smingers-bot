Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, newest first – all February 2026 unless noted)

1. 80.lv (6 Feb) – reports Nvidia will NOT debut new RTX GPUs in 2026, citing memory-supply constraints.  Factual content is the delay; opinion is limited.  Source quality: specialist blog citing The Information and Tom’s Hardware → moderately reliable.

2. GuruFocus / Stockpulse cluster (5 Feb) – quotes closing prices ($171.88) and notes five-day 10 % slide, stalled H200 export deal, CEO commentary.  Mostly factual market data, medium quality.

3. Parameter (5 Feb) – detailed story on H200 export negotiation; provides price ($177.74) and technical levels.  Factual items (license terms, price) are moderate quality (secondary to Reuters).

4. Reuters (4 Feb) – confirms U.S. KYC conditions on H200 sale, Nvidia resistance; price $174.19.  High quality, single authoritative source.

5. CNBC (1 Feb) – market recap; notes NVDA –3 % on rumor its $100 bn OpenAI investment may stall.  High quality for price move; causal attribution speculative.

6. Motley Fool (31 Jan & 8 Jan) – analyst-target pieces ($352 bull, $140 bear, order-book $500 bn).  Opinion-heavy, but factual data on revenue and analyst targets; lower weight.

7. Misc. analyst-target articles (Pintu, Benzinga, NASDAQ, Blockonomi, GuruFocus Nov–Dec 2025).  Older, mostly price-target opinion – weak short-horizon value.

Factual consensus across high-quality sources:  
• Close on 5 Feb ≈ $172; trading just above 200-day SMA $168.  
• Five-day draw-down ≈ –10 %.  
• No earnings until 25 Feb (> forecast window).  
• H200 China export still unresolved; negative headline overhang.  
• Memory shortage delaying gaming GPUs (new on 6 Feb).

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong  
• Historical base rate: large-cap equities show ~53 % one-week upside frequency (structural drift).  
Moderate  
• Near-term negative fundamental news flow (export delays, product postponement) – likely suppress upside for a few days.  
• Recent technical momentum strongly down (–10 % in 5 days); short-term trend inertia often persists several sessions.  
• RSI low-30s & support at 200-day MA – oversold rebounds common.  
Weak  
• Analyst 12-month price targets (250–350) – horizon mismatch.  
• Options “whale” data (puts concentrated 140–180) – ambiguous.  

Net qualitative balance: modestly more short-term headwinds than tailwinds, but bounce potential prevents a decisive lean.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon = 6 trading days (close 6 Feb → close 13 Feb*).  
If horizon halved (3 days) – trend / momentum dominates → probability drops a couple points.  
If doubled (12 days) – more mean-reversion time and possible export headline resolution → probability rises a few points.

(d) Justification of inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view anchor (54 %) reflects mild positive drift.  
Inside view deducts 6 percentage points:  
• –3 pp for confirmed negative news flow (export/license, GPU delay).  
• –2 pp for short-term downward momentum / recent selling pressure.  
• –1 pp for sector-specific weakness (tech selling, AI spend worries).  
Add back +2 pp for technical oversold condition / support at 200-day.  
Net shift –4 pp → 50 %.  I nudge one extra point lower to reflect asymmetric headline risk (regulatory decision could hit during the week), arriving at 49 %.

Probability calibration
My best estimate: Nvidia closes higher on 14 Feb than 6 Feb 49 % of the time; lower/flat 51 %.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will NVDA close higher on 14 Feb 2026 than on 6 Feb 2026 (≈6 trading-day span)?”  
2. Base rate 54 % (equity weekly upside).  
3. 49 out of 100 times the 14 Feb close beats 6 Feb close – plausible given news-flow.  
4. Key evidence: a) –10 % five-day slide (momentum), b) unresolved H200 export deal, c) GPU-delay report (6 Feb), d) oversold/near 200-day support, e) no earnings until after window.  
5. Blind spot – Surprise positive headline (full China export approval) could spark >8 % rally; would push actual probability well above 50 %.  
6. Status-quo tilt – because movement is noisy, stay close to 50 %.

Probability: 49%
