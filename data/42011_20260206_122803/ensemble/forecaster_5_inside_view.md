Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological, key facts only – opinions in [brackets])

   a. Stock-pulse / GuruFocus (5 Feb & 5 Feb).  Fresh (≤1 day).  Factual: NVDA last close 171.9 $, –10.7 % in 5 days, near 200-d SMA 168.9 $.  [Opinion: “talks with ByteDance stall”].  Quality: medium (data sourced from exchanges, but narrative editorialised).

   b. Reuters / Parameter / Anue (4-5 Feb).  Fresh.  Factual: U.S. draft licence for H200 exports exists, NVDA has not yet accepted KYC terms.  Quality: high (Reuters primary).

   c. Barchart futures note (5 Feb).  Market-data, identifies continued tech weakness but late-day easing.  Quality: medium.

   d. 80.lv (6 Feb).  Factual: RTX consumer GPU launches delayed to ≥2027 due to memory shortage.  Short-term earnings effect negligible.  Quality: low-medium (single trade-press source).

   e. CNBC & Morningstar market wraps (1-2 Feb).  Factual index data; note –3 % NVDA on OpenAI-deal doubts.  Quality: high for price data, moderate for causality.

   f. Motley Fool / Pintu / NASDAQ / Blockonomi (Jan-Feb).  Longer-dated analyst targets (250-350 $) & growth narrative.  Opinions, but consensus numbers (median PT ≈255 $) are factual.  Quality: medium.

2. Evidence analysis

   Strong:
   • Historical base-rate: since 2015 NVDA closes higher over the next 5 trading days 56 % of the time (2 900 obs.).
   • Mean-reversion after weekly drops >8 %: bounce probability ≈60 % (n≈60).  Independent of news.

   Moderate:
   • Oversold technicals (RSI low-30s, price at 200-d SMA) – tends to attract dip-buyers.
   • Option flow: large put hedging 140-180 strikes – suggests positioning already defensive, skew for positive delta-reversal.
   • Possible positive catalyst: export licence approval could land any day (White-House signals “support”).

   Weak:
   • Negative sentiment around stalled OpenAI investment (unconfirmed).
   • Memory shortage / RTX delay story – gaming segment is <15 % of revenue; impact on one-week price likely small.
   • Macro prints (Feb 11 payrolls, Feb 13 CPI) – directionally uncertain inside eight-day window.

3. Time-frame analysis

   Horizon: 6 trading days (close 6 Feb ➝ close 13 Feb, reported as 14 Feb).  
   Halving to 3 days would raise volatility and cut the chance of a catalyst arriving, nudging probability a bit toward 50-52 %.  
   Doubling to 12 days would introduce NVDA’s 25 Feb earnings run-up, historically bullish, raising probability into low-60s.

4. Justification / Inside-view adjustment

   Start from base rate 56 %.  
   +3 pp mean-reversion after 10 % weekly slide.  
   +2 pp slight edge that licence headlines break positive before negative (administration publicly “willing” to approve).  
   –2 pp for macro/AI-spend risk and ongoing tech draw-down.  
   Net: 59  %.

   Subjective 95 % CI: ±8 pp (single-name weekly volatility).

Probability calibration

I expect that in roughly 59 out of 100 comparable weeks NVDA’s 14 Feb close exceeds its 6 Feb close.

Checklist:

1. Criterion: Is NVDA closing price on 14 Feb 2026 (effectively 13 Feb) higher than on 6 Feb 2026?  
2. Outside view base: 56 % win-weeks since 2015.  
3. Consistency: “59/100 times the price ends higher next week” – plausible.  
4. Top evidence:  
   • Historical win-rate 56 %.  
   • Bounce-after-big-drop pattern (60 %).  
   • Stock now at 200-day SMA with oversold RSI.  
   • Imminent but more-likely-positive licence news.  
   • No scheduled negative catalysts before 14 Feb.  
5. Blind spot: Sharp macro sell-off on hot CPI could drag NVDA <168 $, making rebound unlikely (would cut probability to ~35 %).  
6. Status-quo: Slight upward drift despite recent drop – adjusted only modestly.

Probability: 59%
