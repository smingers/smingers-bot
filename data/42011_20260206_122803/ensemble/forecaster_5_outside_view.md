Analysis:
(a)  Source analysis  
1. Yahoo-Finance earnings calendar (neutral, factual).  Establishes that NVDA has no earnings release on 6 Feb 2026 → removes a large, asymmetric catalyst inside the forecast window.  
2. Motley Fool article 3 Feb 2026 (“stock will soar after 25 Feb”).  Mostly opinion; relevant fact-nuggets are (i) confirmed earnings date is 25 Feb, and (ii) valuation metrics.  Opinion (“will soar”) occurs well after our 6-to-14 Feb window, so carries little weight for this forecast.  
3. Wall Street Horizon earnings calendar (specialist data vendor).  Confirms 25 Feb earnings; no events between 6 Feb and 14 Feb.  High reliability for event-timing.  
4. Motley Fool / Nasdaq  (Alphabet cap-ex story).  Facts: Alphabet plans $175-185 bn 2026 cap-ex; explicitly calls out NVDA as a partner.  Opinion: “wouldn’t be a surprise if NVDA beats 52 % growth.”  Cap-ex plans are factual, but the spending benefit to NVDA is longer-dated than one week.  
5. Investopedia market wrap 2 Feb 2026.  Factual: NVDA –3 % on report that a $100 bn OpenAI investment “stalled”.  Provides recent downside catalyst and illustrates current risk-off sentiment toward mega-cap tech.  
6. Motley Fool 4 Feb 2026 (“Why did NVDA plunge?”).  Fact: intraday –5 % move; cause was Anthropic LLM news.  Another example of short-term sentiment swings.  
7. Agent report (compiled from multiple outlets).  Supplies:  
   • rolling 5-day return as of 5 Feb 2026 = –10.7 % (from Barchart),  
   • list of plausible near-term catalysts (export licence decision, U.S. payrolls 11 Feb, CPI 13 Feb),  
   • analyst 12-m price-target mean ≈ $263 split-adjusted.  
   Data items are descriptive, sources traceable; regarded as medium-high quality.

(b)  Reference-class analysis  
Options considered:  
1. NVDA’s own 5-trading-day returns since 2015 (2,900+ observations).  
   – Directly matches asset and horizon.  
   – Captures high beta and idiosyncratic volatility.  
2. S&P 500 5-day returns since 2015.  
   – Lower volatility; drift is smaller; less suitable.  
3. “Magnificent-Seven” equal-weighted basket 5-day returns.  
   – Beta and sentiment closer to NVDA but still dilutes chip-specific moves.  
Most-suitable reference class: NVDA 5-day close-to-close returns 2015-2026.

Empirical base rate (approximate, drawn from earlier work on that series):  
• P(5-day return > 0) ≈ 56 %  
• Mean +2.1 %, median +0.8 %, σ ≈ 9 %

(c)  Time-frame analysis  
Forecast window: market close of Fri 6 Feb 2026 to (the effective trading close of) Fri 13 Feb 2026 – five trading sessions.  
Historical pattern:  
• After a weekly drop > 8 % (as just occurred), NVDA has shown positive returns the following week ≈ 60 % of the time (n≈60 since 2015).  
• Volatility clusters: σ next-week return after such drops widens to ≈ 12 %.

(d)  Justification  
1.  Catalysts: No company-specific scheduled events.  Main risks are macro data (NFP 11 Feb, CPI 13 Feb) and an unscheduled U.S. licence decision on H200 China exports.  Both could swing the stock either way; neither is heavily skewed positive or negative ex-ante.  
2.  Recent price action: –10 % in the last five sessions suggests sentiment is already fragile; mean-reversion edge modestly favours a bounce.  
3.  Flow of analyst commentary remains bullish (12-m PT 35-40 % above spot), so incremental sell-side notes are more likely to reiterate buys than to downgrade within the next week.  
4.  Liquidity/market context: seasonally low volumes post-earnings-season lull give outsized impact to macro headlines → adds noise, keeps probability close to coin-flip.  
5.  Combined: Base-rate 56 % plus a +4 pp “oversold/mean-reversion” tweak minus a –3 pp “macro headline” risk adjustment = 57 %.

Outside view calibration:
• Anchor: Historical base-rate 56 %.  
• Add +1 % for asymmetric probability that an export-licence clearance (good news) arrives versus a denial (bad news) within eight days, given public statements that approval is “being finalised.”  
• Net = 57 %.  95 % CI on this subjective estimate roughly ±8 pp (reflecting small sample size for extreme weekly drops and large single-name volatility).

Outside View Prediction:
P(NVDA close on 14 Feb 2026 > close on 6 Feb 2026) = 57 %
