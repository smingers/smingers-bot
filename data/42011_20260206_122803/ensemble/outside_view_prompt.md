# Summary of Yahoo Finance Earnings Calendar Article

## Key Information:

**Article Content:**
This is an earnings calendar listing companies scheduled to report earnings on Friday, February 6 (year appears to be 2026 based on the context).

**Relevant Facts:**
- The calendar shows 25+ companies scheduled to report earnings on February 6, 2026
- NVDA (NVIDIA Corporation) is **not listed** among the companies reporting earnings on this date
- Companies listed include major corporations like Toyota Motor Corporation, Philip Morris International, Biogen Inc., and others
- Earnings announcements are scheduled for "BMO" (Before Market Open) and "AMC" (After Market Close)

**Relevance to the Forecasting Question:**
- February 6, 2026 is the baseline date for the NVDA price comparison in the question
- This calendar confirms that NVDA is not reporting earnings on February 6, 2026
- The absence of NVDA earnings on this specific date means that any price movement between February 6 and February 14, 2026 would not be directly influenced by NVDA's own earnings announcement on the baseline date

**Note:** This article provides limited direct information about NVDA's stock price movements, but confirms the absence of a major catalyst (earnings report) on the baseline comparison date.

# Summary of Article: "Alphabet Just Delivered Great News for Nvidia Stock Investors"

**Source:** Nasdaq (The Motley Fool)

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Alphabet's Q4 Performance:** Alphabet delivered solid fourth-quarter results, beating estimates on both revenue and earnings.

- Despite talk of big tech companies challenging Nvidia with their own chips (like Alphabet's TPUs), hyperscalers remain "largely dependent on Nvidia hardware"
- Combined with Meta Platforms' announcement to nearly double its capex (mentioned last week), these investments show "the AI boom is not only alive but accelerating"
- The author suggests it "wouldn't be a surprise" to see Nvidia beat the 52% revenue growth consensus based on the capex forecasts from Alphabet and Meta
- Notes that "Nvidia is likely to receive a significant portion" of Alphabet's capex spend

## Market Context:
- The AI trade has come under pressure in recent weeks
- Software stocks are "plunging on fears of disruption from AI, which is bringing down chip stocks like Nvidia"

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide NVDA historical 5-day price change distribution since 2015, identify catalysts between 6-Feb-2026 and 14-Feb-2026, and summarize analyst expectations
Below is an integrated status report that directly addresses the three parts of the original request, using only the facts contained in the latest search set.

1. 5-day price-change distribution from 2015-to-date  
   • Data availability is now confirmed.  Split-adjusted daily closes for NVDA can be pulled back to 1 Jan 2000 from either Barchart (free login required) or EODData (CSV download, 22 Jan 1999 forward) (Barchart Price-History page; EODData NVDA page).  
   • However, the raw files have not yet been downloaded, so the complete 2015-2026 rolling 5-session return series has still not been calculated.  The only quantified slice in hand remains the Dec-2024 → 5 Feb 2026 window that was produced in the prior research round.  
   • What can be said now?  Barchart’s “Performance” widget shows that the most recent 5-session change (29 Jan → 5 Feb 2026) is -10.72 % (Barchart Performance page), illustrating the type of output that will populate the eventual distribution.  That said, until the full 2015-2026 data are processed, summary statistics (mean, median, SD, skew, kurtosis, histogram) cannot be delivered.  
   • Information gap: execution of a one-time download (e.g., Barchart Daily, 1 Jan 2015 → 5 Feb 2026), followed by a simple spreadsheet formula: “5-day % = (Closeₜ / Closeₜ₋₅) − 1.”  A pivot table or Python describe() call will then generate the requested distribution.

2. Catalysts that may move NVDA between 6 Feb 2026 and 14 Feb 2026  
   a. H200 export-licence decision.  Multiple outlets (Financial Times as relayed by EconomicTimes, Meyka; TheNews.com.pk) report that U.S. State-Department national-security reviewers are still holding up licences that would let Nvidia ship H200 AI chips to China.  Jensen Huang stated “the licence is being finalised” last week.  Resolution could drop at any time and would be material to data-centre revenue (EconomicTimes article; Meyka blog; TheNews.com.pk, all dated 3-4 Feb 2026).  
   b. January U.S. employment report (rescheduled).  Because the three-day Federal shutdown pushed the Bureau of Labor Statistics calendar back, non-farm payrolls will now be released on 11 Feb 2026—squarely inside the 6-14 Feb window (CNBC live-blog 3 Feb 2026).  Chip shares have been trading as high-beta macro proxies; a surprise here could swing NVDA.  
   c. Macro data: January CPI is due 13 Feb 2026 (standard BLS schedule, although not cited in the captured pages) and is typically the single most-watched inflation print.  
   d. Post-earnings model revisions.  The recent tech pull-back has already produced heavy sell-side traffic—e.g., AMD’s miss on 3 Feb sparked sector downgrades (CNBC 3 Feb 2026).  Street updates to NVDA targets are therefore likely in the same 6-14 Feb horizon once preview models lock in new macro assumptions.  Nothing in the current batch shows an NVDA-specific note, but the timing risk is real.  
   e. Technical oversold condition.  NVDA closed 19 % below its 52-week high on 5 Feb and is trading more than 10 % below the five-day high (Barchart Performance).  A reflex-bounce catalyst exists if macro news turns benign.  
   f. Cisco AI Summit keynote follow-through.  Nvidia’s 4 Feb appearance at Cisco’s AI Summit (TradingView events list) may spawn additional partner announcements in the following week.  
   g. SEC filings.  Nvidia historically files its Form 10-K around 25-26 Feb (Last10K shows 26 Feb 2025).  Therefore no scheduled 10-K falls in the 6-14 Feb window; only an early filing would hit, and none is hinted at in current SEC-feed pages (StockTitan listing as of 30 Jan 2026).  

3. Current analyst expectations  
   • Finbold (2 Feb 2026) aggregates the most recent Wall-Street notes on TipRanks and shows:  
     – Mean 12-to-18-month price target = $262.79 (post-split),  
     – Short-term (28 Feb 2026) AI-model target ≈ $196–199, i.e., ~5 % above the 5 Feb close of $187.88 (Finbold article).  
   • CNN Markets simply flags that NVDA “is trading near the top of its 52-week range” with a $4.18 tn market cap but gives no target numbers (CNN snapshot cited in earlier round).  
   • No fresh sell-side reports dated 6 Feb 2026 or later were captured, so prior consensus EPS and detailed house-by-house targets (Bernstein $270, Goldman $280, Wolfe $250, Morgan Stanley $245, Evercore $260—documented in the previous memo) remain the latest explicit figures.  
   • Sentiment backdrop: sector rotation out of large-cap tech is visible—NVDA down 7.84 % YTD through 5 Feb, Nasdaq down 1.51 % on 3 Feb (CNBC 2-3 Feb 2026 live blogs).  Yet analyst targets still imply >35 % upside to 12-month fair value, suggesting the Street views the sell-off as tactical, not fundamental.

4. Outstanding information needs  
   • Quantitative: download the daily close file and finish the 5-day-return distribution requested.  Until done, the distribution table and histogram remain blank.  
   • Catalyst verification: actively monitor the Federal Register for a Commerce- or State-Department notice on H200 licences; watch EDGAR for any unexpected 8-K between 6-14 Feb.  
   • Street research: run a fresh news-wire scan (e.g., FactSet headlines 7-11 Feb) for NVDA-specific estimate or PT changes after the 4 Feb Cisco event and before the 11 Feb payroll data.

If those gaps are closed—primarily the data download and any late-breaking H200 licence ruling—the original query can be fully satisfied.</Agent_report>
