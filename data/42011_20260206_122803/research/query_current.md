Analysis:
The key to judging whether NVDA’s share price on 2026-02-14 will close above its 2026-02-06 level is to identify near-term catalysts that could push the stock up or down during the coming week.  Relevant information therefore includes:

• Any earnings‐related updates or guidance changes released after the January earnings call (mid-Q4 FY26) that analysts might still be digesting.  
• Fresh buy-side or sell-side research notes announcing target‐price changes, especially if driven by data-center/AI chip demand, gaming recovery, or automotive design wins.  
• Macro or policy news that disproportionately affects high-multiple semiconductor names (e.g., Fed commentary, Treasury yields, export-control rules on China).  
• Competitive or customer announcements (e.g., Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, or Tesla AI infrastructure plans) that could influence short-term sentiment.  
• Unusual option-activity or headline-grabbing technical patterns highlighted by trading desks.

Because the horizon is only six trading days, news items published in the last few days—or over the coming weekend—will matter most.  The search queries therefore focus on extremely recent (or imminent) developments and analyst commentary tied to February 2026 rather than long-term outlooks.
