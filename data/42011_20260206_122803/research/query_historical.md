Analysis:
To judge whether NVDA will be higher on 2026-02-14 than on 2026-02-06, I want (a) the company-specific catalysts expected in the next week—especially the exact February-2026 earnings date or other scheduled events; (b) any breaking news that could move the price (AI chip demand, export restrictions, large customer deals, etc.); and (c) a base-rate view of how NVDA typically moves over a five- to six-trading-day window, including the size and frequency of such moves in recent years. These pieces of context will help quantify both directional bias and volatility.
