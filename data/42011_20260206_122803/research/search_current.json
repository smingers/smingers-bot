The stock price stood at USD 171.88, with a current market capitalization of USD 4.2 trillion and a supply of 24.3 billion shares. Over the past month, Nvidia has declined by -6.97%. The 200-day simple moving average is at USD 168.87, while the 52-week high and low are USD 212.19 (recorded on October 29, 2025) and USD 86.62 (April 7, 2025), respectively. CEO Jensen Huang dismissed concerns about AI replacing traditional software as 'illogical' during a keynote at a major AI conference.

The U.S. Commerce Department approved ByteDance\u2019s license request approximately two weeks prior, but Nvidia has not accepted the proposed Know-Your-Customer (KYC) requirements and other conditions. China granted preliminary approval to ByteDance, Tencent, Alibaba, and AI startup Deepseek to import H200 chips, though final regulatory terms remain pending. The January 15 Commerce Department regulations mandate third-party testing, customer screening, remote user lists for countries of concern (e.g., Iran, Cuba, Venezuela), and a 25% U.S. government fee. Nvidia stated, 'We aren\u2019t able to accept or reject license conditions on our own. Although KYC is important, KYC is not the issue. For American industry to make any sales, the conditions need to be commercially practical, else the market will continue to move to foreign alternatives.' The stock is trading below key resistance levels at $182\u2013$184 and near critical support at the 200-day moving average ($168). Technical indicators show weakening momentum, with the Relative Strength Index in the low 30s, nearing oversold territory. Trading volume has been moderate, suggesting corrective selling rather than panic. Market expectations are for NVDA to trade between $170 and $185 until export clarity emerges, with potential for a breakout above $185 only on positive approval news or broader AI sector strength. A close below $168 would signal further technical deterioration. One source suggested some chips may ship to China before Trump\u2019s planned April meeting with Chinese President Xi Jinping, as the Commerce Department typically consults multiple agencies before finalizing licenses.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 04:30 PM\nSource:[Parameter](https://parameter.io/nvidia-nvda-stock-slides-as-trump-administration-sets-h200-export-conditions/)\n\n**Tech Cracks Again as Sellers Press the Advantage**\nE-mini S&P and E-mini NQ futures opened lower, driven by continued selling pressure in technology stocks.

The U.S. government reportedly signaled approval for export licenses about two weeks prior, but NVIDIA has not yet accepted the current draft terms. NVIDIA, which acts as an intermediary between the U.S. government and potential customers, stated it cannot unilaterally accept or reject licensing conditions. A company spokesperson emphasized that while KYC is important, the core issue is whether the terms are commercially viable\u2014otherwise, the market may shift toward foreign alternatives. NVIDIA is also negotiating broader export terms for H200 chips to Chinese firms. The U.S. Department of Commerce has not responded to requests for comment. Sources indicate that once national security concerns are addressed, the U.S. is expected to approve both NVIDIA\u2019s H200 sales and AMD\u2019s similar chip exports to China, as President Trump has expressed support for such transactions. On February 4, 2026, NVIDIA (NVDA-US) closed down 3.41% at $174.19 per share, but its after-hours stock price rose over 2% following Alphabet\u2019s announcement that its 2026 capital expenditure target would be $175 billion to $185 billion\u2014well above analyst expectations.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 10:54 PM\nSource:[Anue\u9245\u4ea8](https://news.cnyes.com/news/id/6332853)\n\n**Up Over 1,200% Since 2023, Is It Too Late to Buy Nvidia Stock? | The Motley Fool**\nNvidia (NVDA) stock has risen over 1,200% from January 1, 2023, to January 30, 2026, turning a $10,000 investment into more than $130,000. Despite concerns about a market bubble, Nvidia's stock has continued to perform strongly, driven by massive spending by AI hyperscalers on data center infrastructure. Nvidia's GPUs are the dominant computing units for AI training and inference, fueling the company's revenue and net income growth since 2023. Wall Street analysts project 63% revenue growth for fiscal year 2026 and 52% for fiscal year 2027. Nvidia anticipates global data center spending will reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion by 2030, up from $600 billion in 2025, representing a 42% growth rate. The article argues that while a 1,200% return is unlikely again, a doubling or tripling of the stock price between now and 2030 remains possible due to sustained AI investment. The author, having previously missed the initial rise, bought shares in April 2025 during a market pullback and views Nvidia as a 'no-brainer buy' despite the stock's prior gains.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 06:06 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/02/04/up-over-1200-since-2023-is-it-too-late-to-buy-nvid/)\n\n**This Is What Whales Are Betting On NVIDIA**\nFinancial institutions have made a notable bullish move on NVIDIA (NASDAQ: NVDA), with 60 unusual options trades identified in a recent analysis.

Microsoft (MSFT) fell -2.87% to USD 411.21, with a market cap of USD 3.2 trillion and a P/E ratio of 25.92; despite strong top-line results, cloud growth slowed and capital expenditures for AI infrastructure rose, leading to a muted market reaction and mixed institutional activity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 09:52 AM\nSource:[Stockpulse](https://api2.stockpulse.de/newstex/760511851)\n\n**NVIDIA (NVDA) Stock: Dips, But China\u2019s Massive H200 Chip Orders Signal Strong Demand**\nNVIDIA (NVDA) stock closed at $185.61 on February 3, 2026, a decline of 2.89%, but pre-market trading showed a slight rebound to $186.66, a 0.57% gain. Despite the stock dip, strong demand for the H200 chip was confirmed by Chinese tech giants ByteDance, Alibaba, and Tencent, which collectively ordered over 400,000 H200 chips to expand their AI infrastructure. This marks a significant shift in China\u2019s approach to U.S. semiconductor technology, allowing the import of advanced chips despite prior restrictions. The H200 chip offers approximately six times the performance of the prior H20 model and is central to China\u2019s strategy to scale AI capabilities. Reports indicate that demand for the H200 exceeds two million units, reflecting long-term investment in high-performance computing. Although shipment timelines remain uncertain due to regulatory fluctuations in China, the scale of orders signals sustained and robust demand. NVIDIA remains a dominant force in AI and data center computing, with its accelerated computing platforms critical for global AI workloads across gaming, cloud, and automotive sectors. The H200\u2019s role in enhancing computational power strengthens NVIDIA\u2019s competitive edge and positions the company to capture a growing share of the global AI market.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 08:45 PM\nSource:[Parameter](https://parameter.io/nvidia-nvda-stock-dips-but-chinas-massive-h200-chip-orders-signal-strong-demand/)\n\n**Bullish Momentum Drives NVDA Stock Toward $200, Flag Formation Forms**\nNvidia (NVDA) stock continues its upward momentum, approaching the $200 target, despite a significant compression in its earnings multiple from over 150x in 2023 to the mid-40x range by February 2026. The stock has maintained strong price performance, with weekly chart patterns showing higher highs and higher lows since early 2024, indicating a firm bullish trend. On the daily chart, a tightening flag formation has emerged, characterized by pullbacks respecting an ascending support line, suggesting a consolidation phase ahead of a potential breakout. A short, downward-sloping resistance line has capped recent gains, but persistent demand at this level signals strong underlying interest. Momentum indicators, including RSI, remain neutral to positive, avoiding overbought conditions and supporting further price expansion. Analysts and traders, such as @Mr_Derivatives, predict a breakout above resistance could trigger a move to $200, followed by potential all-time highs. The $200 level is viewed as a key psychological target, with a clear path to $210 and beyond if the trend holds, according to the analysis published by CoinCentral on February 3, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 12:15 PM\nSource:[CoinCentral](https://coincentral.com/bullish-momentum-drives-nvda-stock-toward-200-flag-formation-forms/)\n\n**How the stock market's big turnaround on Monday put the S&P 500 back in record territory**\nThe S&P 500 closed at 6,976.44 on Monday, February 2, 2026, just shy of a record high, marking a rebound after a three-session losing streak and snapping a period of market weakness. The index gained 0.5%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 1.1% and the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.6%. Despite declines in major AI stocks like Nvidia (NVDA), Microsoft (MSFT), and Meta (META), a 'rotation trade' was evident, with small-cap stocks leading the rally\u2014specifically, the Russell 2000 Index gained 1%. This outperformance occurred despite a rise in the 10-year Treasury yield to 4.28% (up from ~4% in late October), which typically pressures smaller, debt-heavy companies. A key catalyst was a strong jump in the Institute for Supply Management\u2019s manufacturing index to 52.6% in January, the highest since June 2022, signaling economic resilience. Stabilizing gold and silver prices\u2014after a 31% plunge in silver on Friday\u2014also contributed to market optimism. Market strategists, including Angelo Kourkafas of Edward Jones and Mark Hackett of Nationwide, cited 'buy the dip' behavior, technical strength (S&P 500 above its 50-day moving average of 6,864.80), and declining short interest in ETFs like SPY and QQQ as signs of market confidence. Hackett noted that shorting the market has become less appealing due to aggressive buying on any weakness. The rally reflects broader resilience in U.S. equities, particularly among cyclical and small-cap segments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 10:32 PM\nSource:[Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20260202186/how-the-stock-markets-big-turnaround-on-monday-put-the-sp-500-back-in-record-territory)\n\n**5 Things to Know Before the Stock Market Opens**\nStock futures are pointing to a lower open for major indexes, with the S&P 500 and Nasdaq futures down 0.5% and 0.8% respectively, while Dow Jones futures slipped 0.1%, driven by renewed concerns over AI spending and a report suggesting Nvidia's $100 billion investment plan in OpenAI may be in jeopardy. Nvidia (NVDA) shares declined 1.5% amid reports that CEO Jensen Huang questioned the deal's finalization and criticized OpenAI's 'lack of discipline' amid rising competition. The Walt Disney Company (DIS) beat earnings expectations with $24.98 billion in revenue and $1.63 in adjusted EPS, surpassing analyst consensus; streaming revenue grew 11% year-over-year, and its Experiences segment reported a record $10 billion in revenue. However, Disney shares fell 2% in premarket trading after reports emerged that CEO Bob Iger plans to step down before his 2026 contract ends, with Josh D'Amaro seen as a likely successor. Palantir (PLTR) is set to report results after the market close, with shares up 2% premarket despite a 30% drop from its 2025 peak, as analysts remain split with four 'buy' and five 'hold' ratings. Oracle (ORCL) plans to raise $45\u201350 billion through debt and equity, including up to $20 billion in new shares, to fund its AI infrastructure expansion, particularly to support its $300 billion OpenAI deal; Oracle shares rose 4% in premarket trading. Crude oil futures dropped over 4% to $62.25 per barrel after President Donald Trump signaled ongoing Iran negotiations, easing supply fears. Gold futures gained 0.2% to $4,755 per ounce, recovering from Friday\u2019s sell-off, while Bitcoin rebounded to $78,000 from a low of $74,500, its lowest since April 2025.

The updated rules introduced third-party testing and supply certification, requiring Nvidia to confirm domestic supply levels before exporting, with laboratory reviews verifying AI performance thresholds to determine shipment timing. This structured approach reduced uncertainty while preserving oversight. Meanwhile, China signaled that H200 imports would be permitted only under 'necessary use' circumstances, allowing advanced research but tightly controlling demand. Chinese AI firms, including major cloud operators, have expressed interest in hundreds of thousands of H200 units, far exceeding current supply, with production timelines pointing to increased availability by 2026. Beijing emphasized alignment with national priorities, reinforcing long-term domestic semiconductor development goals. Nvidia is preparing initial H200 batches for early 2026 delivery, with some modules potentially shipped before the Lunar New Year. The global AI race intensifies as both the U.S. and China shape export and domestic policies, with synchronized regulatory clearance expected to define the next phase of market dynamics.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 11:45 PM\nSource:[Parameter](https://parameter.io/nvidia-nvda-stock-slightly-surge-as-u-s-eases-export-rules-while-china-weighs-necessary-use-approval-for-h200-chips/)\n\n**NVDA Sees 38.9% Annual Gain Despite Year-End Decline**\nOn the final trading day of 2025, NVIDIA (NVDA) saw a 0.6% decline in its share price, closing at $186.50. Despite this year-end drop, the company's stock rose approximately 38.9% over the full year, though this performance was significantly lower than its 171% gain in 2024. NVIDIA maintained its position as the most valuable company in the U.S. stock market, with a market capitalization of $4.53 trillion\u2014surpassing Apple (AAPL), which had a valuation of approximately $4 trillion. During 2025, NVDA's intraday high reached $212.19, while its low was $86.62.

Wall Street analysts project a mean price target of $255.56, implying a 41.2% upside potential, based on 45 short-term estimates with a standard deviation of $42.76. The most optimistic target is $352.00 (a 94.5% surge), while the lowest is $140.00 (a 22.7% decline). The standard deviation indicates moderate dispersion among analyst views. Despite widespread skepticism about the reliability of price targets\u2014due to potential business incentives skewing optimism\u2014analysts show strong consensus in revising earnings estimates upward: 10 of 11 estimates increased over the past 30 days, raising the Zacks Consensus Estimate by 2.7%. This trend correlates with positive near-term stock performance, according to empirical research. NVDA holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), placing it in the top 5% of over 4,000 ranked stocks based on earnings estimate factors. The report cautions against relying solely on price targets, noting they often mislead investors, but acknowledges that consensus direction, especially when supported by earnings revisions and strong ranking, can be a useful signal. The article also promotes a proprietary list of five high-potential stocks, including NVDA, as 'favorites' to gain over 100% in the near term, citing past recommendations with returns of +171%, +209%, and +232%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 22, 2025 02:55 PM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/wall-street-analysts-think-nvidia-nvda-could-surge-412-read-placing-bet)\n\n**Nvidia (NVDA) Stock: Why Bernstein Sees 50% Gains After November Selloff**\nNvidia (NVDA) stock closed at $180 on Thursday, posting a 1.37% daily gain and a year-to-date increase of over 30%. Despite a 13% decline in November driven by concerns over AI sector valuations and competition from Alphabet, Bernstein upgraded NVDA to 'Strong Buy' with a $272 price target, implying 50% upside potential. The firm cited resolution of key investor concerns\u2014such as working capital management, revenue circularity, accounts receivable, and depreciation lifetime\u2014as 'broadly valid and useful' in its analysis. Wall Street remains overwhelmingly bullish: 61 of 66 analysts rate NVDA as Buy, with a consensus target of $254, representing 41% upside. Major banks including Bank of America, Citigroup, and Phillip Securities also issued Buy ratings. CEO Jensen Huang set an ambitious $500 billion annual revenue target for 2026, supported by the complete sell-out of the Blackwell chip line. Strong enterprise demand for next-generation GPUs continues, with robust orders across data center infrastructure buildouts. Despite China\u2019s AI chip restrictions, trading volume remained stable, and demand from other markets offset concerns. Mizuho\u2019s Vijay Rakesh maintained an Outperform rating with a $245 target, noting the Blackwell shortage reflects healthy market conditions. Price targets from top firms cluster between $245 and $272, all indicating double-digit gains from the November 28 closing price. The November selloff may present a strategic entry point ahead of year-end positioning.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 01:30 PM\nSource:[Blockonomi](https://blockonomi.com/nvidia-nvda-stock-why-bernstein-sees-50-gains-after-november-selloff/)\n\n**Nvidia's Earnings Report Will Be Out on Wednesday, Nov. 19 - How to Play NVDA Stock**\nNvidia Inc. (NVDA) is scheduled to release its earnings and free cash flow results for the quarter ending October after the market close on Wednesday, November 19, 2025. NVDA stock closed at $190.17 on Friday, November 14, 2025, down from a recent peak of $206.88 on November 3, but up from a low of $188.15 on November 7. Analysts project revenue of $207.56 billion for the year ending January 2026 and $290.11 billion for the year ending January 2027. Using a 39% free cash flow (FCF) margin, a $230 price target is estimated, based on an average next-12-month (NTM) forecast of $269.5 billion. A higher revenue forecast of $290.11 billion leads to a price target of $268.05, depending on margin assumptions. If Q3 FCF exceeds 29%, a higher price target may be justified. To play the upcoming earnings release, one strategy is to sell short out-of-the-money (OTM) put options. A $170 put expiring December 12, 2025, previously sold for $4.60, has since declined to a midpoint premium of $3.30, yielding a 1.94% return over 27 days. A new trade involves selling the December 19, 2025, $181.00 put for a $7.20 premium, yielding 3.978% with a strike 4.82% below the closing price. The breakeven point is $173.80, and the net cost of acquiring 100 shares is $17,380 after receiving $720 in premium. This strategy can be repeated monthly, with a potential 3-month return of 12% (equivalent to a $212.99 price target), allowing investors to set a lower buy-in point while earning income.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 16, 2025 02:13 PM\nSource:[Barchart.com](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/36149219/nvidia-s-earnings-report-will-be-out-on-wednesday-nov-19-how-to-play-nvda-stock)\n\n**NVIDIA (NVDA) Valuation Could Surge Beyond $8.5 Trillion, Analysts Predict**\nFollowing NVIDIA (NVDA) surpassing a $5 trillion market capitalization, analysts predict further significant growth.
