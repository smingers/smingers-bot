However, since earnings are released **after market close**, this would not directly impact trading during the period being forecasted.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/alphabet-just-delivered-great-news-nvidia-stock-investors\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Alphabet Just Delivered Great News for Nvidia Stock Investors\"\n\n**Source:** Nasdaq (The Motley Fool)\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Alphabet's Q4 Performance:** Alphabet delivered solid fourth-quarter results, beating estimates on both revenue and earnings.\n\n2. **Capital Expenditure Plans:** Alphabet announced plans to spend $175 billion-$185 billion in capex in 2026, which is **double what it spent in 2025**.\n\n3. **Gemini Enterprise Sales:** Alphabet sold 8 million paid seats for Gemini Enterprise just four months after its launch.\n\n4. **Nvidia Revenue Consensus:** Wall Street consensus for Nvidia's fiscal 2027 (which just began) projects revenue growth of **52%**.\n\n5. **NVDA Last Close Price (as of question creation 2026-02-01):** $191.13\n\n6. **Recent Stock Performance:** Alphabet stock had doubled in the last six months prior to the earnings report, but declined after the announcement despite beating estimates.\n\n## Key Opinions and Analysis:\n\n**From Named/Reliable Sources:**\n- Alphabet management stated the capex will \"support frontier model development by Google Deep Mind\" and improvements in core businesses like advertising\n- Management specifically called out Nvidia as a key partner and said Alphabet would be among the first to get access to Nvidia's new Vera Rubin GPU platform\n- Alphabet defended the AI boom, stating they are \"seeing our AI investments and infrastructure drive revenue and growth across the board\"\n\n**From Article Author (The Motley Fool/Jeremy Bowman):**\n- Despite talk of big tech companies challenging Nvidia with their own chips (like Alphabet's TPUs), hyperscalers remain \"largely dependent on Nvidia hardware\"\n- Combined with Meta Platforms' announcement to nearly double its capex (mentioned last week), these investments show \"the AI boom is not only alive but accelerating\"\n- The author suggests it \"wouldn't be a surprise\" to see Nvidia beat the 52% revenue growth consensus based on the capex forecasts from Alphabet and Meta\n- Notes that \"Nvidia is likely to receive a significant portion\" of Alphabet's capex spend\n\n## Market Context:\n- The AI trade has come under pressure in recent weeks\n- Software stocks are \"plunging on fears of disruption from AI, which is bringing down chip stocks like Nvidia\"\n\n**Disclosure:** Author Jeremy Bowman has positions in Amazon, Meta Platforms, and Nvidia.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.investopedia.com/dow-jones-today-02022026-11897235\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Markets News, Feb. 2, 2026: Stock Indexes End Sharply Higher to Begin February\"\n\n**Date:** February 06, 2026  \n**Source:** Investopedia\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n### General Market Performance (Monday, February 2, 2026):\n- Dow Jones Industrial Average: +515 points (+1.1%)\n- S&P 500: +0.5% (just missed a new closing record)\n- Nasdaq: +0.6%\n\n### NVDA-Specific Information:\n- **Nvidia (NVDA) shares declined nearly 3%** on Monday, February 2, 2026\n- **Reason for decline:** The Wall Street Journal reported (citing people familiar with the matter) that Nvidia's plan to invest up to $100 billion in ChatGPT maker OpenAI had stalled\n- Nvidia is described as \"the world's most valuable company\"\n\n### Other Market Context:\n- Previous Friday (January 30): All three indexes finished lower after news that President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh to succeed Jerome Powell as Federal Reserve Chair\n- January performance: Dow and S&P 500 finished higher for the month; Nasdaq slightly lower\n\n### Magnificent Seven Performance:\n- Mixed performance overall\n- Apple (AAPL): +4% (best performer of the group)\n- Alphabet (GOOGL): +1.6%\n- Amazon (AMZN): +1.5%\n- Nvidia (NVDA): -3%\n\n### Other Notable Market Movements:\n- West Texas Intermediate crude: -4.5% to $62.20/barrel\n- Gold futures: -0.8% to around $4,700/ounce\n- Bitcoin: trading around $78,100\n- 10-year Treasury yield: 4.28%\n\n**Note:** The article date is listed as February 06, 2026, but the content describes market activity from Monday, February 2, 2026.

Split-adjusted daily closes for NVDA can be pulled back to 1 Jan 2000 from either Barchart (free login required) or EODData (CSV download, 22 Jan 1999 forward) (Barchart Price-History page; EODData NVDA page).  \n   \u2022 However, the raw files have not yet been downloaded, so the complete 2015-2026 rolling 5-session return series has still not been calculated.  The only quantified slice in hand remains the Dec-2024 \u2192 5 Feb 2026 window that was produced in the prior research round.  \n   \u2022 What can be said now?  Barchart\u2019s \u201cPerformance\u201d widget shows that the most recent 5-session change (29 Jan \u2192 5 Feb 2026) is -10.72 % (Barchart Performance page), illustrating the type of output that will populate the eventual distribution.  That said, until the full 2015-2026 data are processed, summary statistics (mean, median, SD, skew, kurtosis, histogram) cannot be delivered.  \n   \u2022 Information gap: execution of a one-time download (e.g., Barchart Daily, 1 Jan 2015 \u2192 5 Feb 2026), followed by a simple spreadsheet formula: \u201c5-day % = (Close\u209c / Close\u209c\u208b\u2085) \u2212 1.\u201d  A pivot table or Python describe() call will then generate the requested distribution.\n\n2. Catalysts that may move NVDA between 6 Feb 2026 and 14 Feb 2026  \n   a. H200 export-licence decision.  Multiple outlets (Financial Times as relayed by EconomicTimes, Meyka; TheNews.com.pk) report that U.S. State-Department national-security reviewers are still holding up licences that would let Nvidia ship H200 AI chips to China.  Jensen Huang stated \u201cthe licence is being finalised\u201d last week.  Resolution could drop at any time and would be material to data-centre revenue (EconomicTimes article; Meyka blog; TheNews.com.pk, all dated 3-4 Feb 2026).  \n   b. January U.S. employment report (rescheduled).  Because the three-day Federal shutdown pushed the Bureau of Labor Statistics calendar back, non-farm payrolls will now be released on 11 Feb 2026\u2014squarely inside the 6-14 Feb window (CNBC live-blog 3 Feb 2026).  Chip shares have been trading as high-beta macro proxies; a surprise here could swing NVDA.  \n   c. Macro data: January CPI is due 13 Feb 2026 (standard BLS schedule, although not cited in the captured pages) and is typically the single most-watched inflation print.  \n   d. Post-earnings model revisions.  The recent tech pull-back has already produced heavy sell-side traffic\u2014e.g., AMD\u2019s miss on 3 Feb sparked sector downgrades (CNBC 3 Feb 2026).  Street updates to NVDA targets are therefore likely in the same 6-14 Feb horizon once preview models lock in new macro assumptions.  Nothing in the current batch shows an NVDA-specific note, but the timing risk is real.  \n   e. Technical oversold condition.  NVDA closed 19 % below its 52-week high on 5 Feb and is trading more than 10 % below the five-day high (Barchart Performance).  A reflex-bounce catalyst exists if macro news turns benign.  \n   f. Cisco AI Summit keynote follow-through.  Nvidia\u2019s 4 Feb appearance at Cisco\u2019s AI Summit (TradingView events list) may spawn additional partner announcements in the following week.  \n   g. SEC filings.  Nvidia historically files its Form 10-K around 25-26 Feb (Last10K shows 26 Feb 2025).  Therefore no scheduled 10-K falls in the 6-14 Feb window; only an early filing would hit, and none is hinted at in current SEC-feed pages (StockTitan listing as of 30 Jan 2026).  \n\n3. Current analyst expectations  \n   \u2022 Finbold (2 Feb 2026) aggregates the most recent Wall-Street notes on TipRanks and shows:  \n     \u2013 Mean 12-to-18-month price target = $262.79 (post-split),  \n     \u2013 Short-term (28 Feb 2026) AI-model target \u2248 $196\u2013199, i.e., ~5 % above the 5 Feb close of $187.88 (Finbold article).  \n   \u2022 CNN Markets simply flags that NVDA \u201cis trading near the top of its 52-week range\u201d with a $4.18 tn market cap but gives no target numbers (CNN snapshot cited in earlier round).  \n   \u2022 No fresh sell-side reports dated 6 Feb 2026 or later were captured, so prior consensus EPS and detailed house-by-house targets (Bernstein $270, Goldman $280, Wolfe $250, Morgan Stanley $245, Evercore $260\u2014documented in the previous memo) remain the latest explicit figures.  \n   \u2022 Sentiment backdrop: sector rotation out of large-cap tech is visible\u2014NVDA down 7.84 % YTD through 5 Feb, Nasdaq down 1.51 % on 3 Feb (CNBC 2-3 Feb 2026 live blogs).  Yet analyst targets still imply >35 % upside to 12-month fair value, suggesting the Street views the sell-off as tactical, not fundamental.\n\n4. Outstanding information needs  \n   \u2022 Quantitative: download the daily close file and finish the 5-day-return distribution requested.  Until done, the distribution table and histogram remain blank.  \n   \u2022 Catalyst verification: actively monitor the Federal Register for a Commerce- or State-Department notice on H200 licences; watch EDGAR for any unexpected 8-K between 6-14 Feb.  \n   \u2022 Street research: run a fresh news-wire scan (e.g., FactSet headlines 7-11 Feb) for NVDA-specific estimate or PT changes after the 4 Feb Cisco event and before the 11 Feb payroll data.\n\nIf those gaps are closed\u2014primarily the data download and any late-breaking H200 licence ruling\u2014the original query can be fully satisfied.</Agent_report>\n"
