  - Polymarket probabilities: 21% chance before 2027; Kalshi: 13% before May 1, 2026
  - Trump threatened tariffs on 7-8 European nations, then backed down
  - Denmark and Greenland consistently reject sovereignty transfer
  - Historical context: U.S. tried to purchase Greenland at least 3 times (1867, 1910, 1946) - all failed
  - Current U.S. military access under 1951 treaty is extensive

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE pointing toward CP staying at or below 25%:**

1. **No formal offer has been made** (ABC News source with unnamed official): "the U.S. goal to buy the island was never communicated to Copenhagen -- which the source said had never received an offer of any kind"
   - This is the most critical fact: As of late January 2026, no formal purchase offer exists
   - Resolution criteria requires U.S. to make "formal proposal of monetary or any other consideration" for sovereignty transfer
   - Multiple independent sources confirm negotiations focus on alternatives (mineral rights, base sovereignty, security arrangements)

2. **Diplomatic pivot away from purchase** (BBC, FactCheck.org, Brookings - multiple independent sources):
   - January 22 "framework" announcement explicitly about mineral rights and security, NOT sovereignty transfer
   - Trump ruled out military force (which might have precipitated an ultimatum-style offer)
   - Danish PM: "can negotiate on everything" except sovereignty
   - Pattern suggests both sides pursuing arrangements that avoid formal purchase offer

3. **Expert consensus** (FactCheck.org - identified experts Bolton, Daalder, Olesen; ABC News - expert McPartland):
   - Multiple experts state formal ownership unnecessary for U.S. strategic goals
   - Existing 1951 treaty provides extensive access
   - No security problems require ownership

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**

4. **Historical failure pattern** (multiple AskNews sources):
   - U.S. attempted purchase 3 times (1867, 1910, 1946) - all failed
   - Denmark consistently refused even when offered significant sums
   - Pattern suggests formal offer, if made, would be immediately rejected

5. **Recent trajectory** (Brookings, BBC):
   - Trump backed down from military threats after market reaction
   - Tariff threats withdrawn
   - Suggests de-escalation trend

**WEAK EVIDENCE pointing toward CP rising above 25%:**

6. **Rubio tasked with developing proposal** (NBC News, January 14):
   - Rubio directed to develop proposal "in coming weeks"
   - However, this was mid-January; we're now in early February with no reported progress
   - ABC News source says no offer was ever communicated

7. **Trump's unpredictability**:
   - Could make surprise announcement
   - However, recent pattern shows market/diplomatic pressure constrains him

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 9 days (February 6 to February 15, 2026)

**Original question timeframe:** 107 days (January 12 to May 1, 2026); 84 days remain

**Analysis:**
- 9 days is very short for major diplomatic developments
- If timeframe were halved (4-5 days): Would increase confidence CP stays ≤25% (even less time for news catalyst)
- If timeframe were doubled (18 days): Would slightly decrease confidence CP stays ≤25% (more time for unexpected developments, though still unlikely)

**Critical insight:** The meta-question asks about CP on February 15, not whether actual offer will be made by May 1. However:
- If no significant news emerges in next 9 days suggesting formal offer is imminent, CP likely stays stable or declines
- Current CP of exactly 25.00% (as of February 1) suggests community has already priced in recent developments
- For CP to rise above 25%, need positive news catalyst in next 9 days

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Adjustment:**

My outside view base rate was 43%, assuming roughly even odds with slight negative bias due to recent diplomatic pivot.

**Current evidence significantly shifts this downward:**

1. **Most critical factor:** ABC News source explicitly states "no offer of any kind" has been made to Copenhagen. This is direct evidence that as of late January, the mechanism required for resolution (formal offer) has not occurred despite weeks of negotiations.

2. **Diplomatic consensus on alternatives:** Multiple independent sources (BBC, FactCheck.org, Brookings) confirm negotiations focus on arrangements SHORT of sovereignty transfer (mineral rights, base sovereignty, security agreements). This represents a clear pivot away from the purchase offer scenario.

3. **Expert consensus:** Multiple identified experts across sources agree formal ownership is unnecessary and existing arrangements sufficient. This reduces likelihood Trump administration will pursue formal purchase offer.

4. **Time pressure argument weakens:** If Rubio was tasked in mid-January to develop proposal "in coming weeks," and we're now in early February with no reported offer, this suggests either (a) proposal development stalled, or (b) focus shifted to alternatives.

5. **Recent de-escalation pattern:** Trump's withdrawal of military force threats and tariffs (late January) suggests trend away from confrontational purchase offer toward cooperative security arrangements.

**Why this renders reference class less analogous:**
- My outside view assumed roughly equal probability of CP rising vs. staying/falling
- However, the strong evidence that (a) no offer has been made despite weeks of opportunity, (b) diplomatic focus has shifted to alternatives, and (c) expert consensus suggests offer unnecessary, means the current situation is NOT analogous to "uncertain Trump statement that might materialize"
- This is more analogous to "Trump statement that has been diplomatically defused through alternative arrangements"

**Metaculus community likely reasoning:**
- Community is sophisticated enough to distinguish between (1) Trump's interest in Greenland, (2) negotiations on security/minerals, and (3) formal purchase offer
- Current CP of 25% likely reflects: ~75% chance no formal offer made by May 1, ~25% chance formal offer made
- For CP to rise above 25% in next 9 days, need news suggesting formal offer more likely
- Absent such news, CP likely stable or declining

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view of 43%, adjusting for:

**Strong downward factors:**
- No formal offer made despite weeks of opportunity (-15%)
- Diplomatic pivot to alternatives well-established (-10%)
- Expert consensus offer unnecessary (-5%)
- Recent de-escalation pattern (-5%)

**Mild upward factors:**
- Trump unpredictability (+3%)
- Exact threshold positioning (25.00%) creates slight upward bias (+2%)
- Short timeframe limits major decline (+2%)

**Adjusted probability:** 43% - 35% + 7% = **15%**

This represents: 15% chance CP rises above 25.00% by February 15, 2026

**Calibration check:** Does 15% feel right?
- 15% = roughly 1 in 7 odds
- This means: "In 7 similar situations where strong evidence points toward diplomatic alternatives rather than formal purchase offer, and where no offer has been made despite opportunity, the Metaculus community prediction would rise above current level in about 1 of those 7 cases within a 9-day window"
- This seems appropriately calibrated given Trump's unpredictability as the main upside risk

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Metaculus community prediction for "US offers to purchase Greenland before May 1, 2026" exceed 25% on February 15, 2026? (9-day window)

2. **Base rate:** Started at 43% (roughly even odds with slight negative bias). Strong evidence of diplomatic pivot to alternatives and no formal offer despite opportunity justifies substantial downward adjustment to 15%.

3. **Consistency:** "15 out of 100 times, the Metaculus CP rises above 25.00% by February 15." This aligns with my assessment that strong evidence points away from formal offer, but Trump's unpredictability creates meaningful upside risk.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - ABC News: No formal offer has been made to Copenhagen (verified, direct source statement)
   - Multiple sources: Diplomatic framework focuses on alternatives to purchase (BBC, FactCheck.org, Brookings - verified)
   - Expert consensus: Formal ownership unnecessary for U.S. goals (Bolton, Daalder, Olesen, McPartland - identified experts)
   - Recent pattern: Trump backed down from threats, withdrew tariffs (BBC, Brookings - verified)

5. **Blind spot:** Trump makes surprise announcement of formal purchase offer in next 9 days, perhaps framing it as "take it or leave it" despite knowing Denmark will reject. This could spike CP above 25% even if offer is DOA. Probability: ~10-15% this occurs.

6. **Status quo:** Current CP at exactly 25.00% suggests stability. Absent major news catalyst, inertia favors CP remaining at or near current level. However, if any news emerges, more likely to be negative (further confirmation of alternative arrangements) than positive (formal offer announcement). Slight nudge toward status quo appropriate.

Probability: 15%
