Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Polymarket Article:**
- **Type:** Resolution criteria for a prediction market
- **Quality:** High for understanding market mechanics, but addresses a different question (actual acquisition vs. offer to purchase)
- **Key Facts:** Market trading volume of $7.6M suggests significant interest; resolution criteria are clearly defined but don't directly inform our question
- **Limitations:** Different timeframe (through end of 2026 vs. before May 1, 2026) and different threshold (actual acquisition vs. offer)

**NBC News (January 14, 2026):**
- **Type:** News reporting with named and unnamed sources
- **Quality:** High-quality mainstream source with specific attributions
- **Key Facts:** 
  - Estimated purchase price: $500-700 billion
  - Senior White House Official confirmed Rubio directed to develop proposal "in coming weeks" (high priority)
  - 85% of Greenlanders reject becoming part of U.S.
  - Scheduled meeting between Rubio/Vance and Danish/Greenland officials
- **Expert Opinion:** Ian Lesser (German Marshall Fund) suggests force prospects "still very small"
- **Assessment:** This is a PAST event (January 14 is before today's date of February 6, 2026), so these are historical facts, not predictions

**BBC Article (January 22, 2026):**
- **Type:** News reporting on Trump announcement
- **Quality:** High-quality international source
- **Key Facts (PAST events as of Feb 6):**
  - Trump announced "framework of a future deal" on Truth Social
  - Deal described as potentially involving **mineral rights** rather than ownership
  - Diplomatic sources told CBS "no agreement for American control or ownership"
  - Danish PM: can negotiate on "everything political; security, investments, economy. But we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty"
- **Critical Distinction:** The "framework" appears to be about mineral rights/security arrangements, NOT a purchase of sovereignty
- **Assessment:** This significantly undermines the likelihood of an actual purchase offer

**Fortune Article (January 21, 2026):**
- **Type:** News analysis of Trump's Davos speech
- **Quality:** High-quality business publication
- **Key Facts (PAST events):**
  - Trump explicitly ruled out military force
  - Framed Greenland as strategic/security interest rather than economic
  - Denmark has committed additional multibillion-kroner programs for Arctic defense
- **Assessment:** Trump's rhetoric focuses on security arrangements, not outright purchase

**Agent Report:**
- **Type:** Technical investigation into Metaculus data availability
- **Quality:** Thorough but ultimately unsuccessful in retrieving historical prediction data
- **Key Finding:** Cannot access historical community prediction values or comments for question 41514 without API authentication
- **Limitation:** We cannot see how the community prediction has evolved from its current 25% baseline

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Historical U.S. territorial purchase attempts (Alaska, Louisiana Purchase, Virgin Islands):**
   - Suitability: Low - These occurred in vastly different geopolitical contexts; modern sovereignty norms make this nearly obsolete
   
2. **Trump's previous Greenland purchase discussion (2019):**
   - Suitability: Medium-High - Most directly relevant
   - In 2019: Trump floated idea → Denmark rejected → no formal offer was made
   - Pattern: Rhetorical interest → diplomatic rejection → de-escalation to security arrangements

3. **Metaculus community predictions on geopolitical questions involving Trump:**
   - Suitability: Medium - Would be ideal but we lack access to historical data
   
4. **Recent Trump administration territorial/sovereignty proposals (Panama Canal, Canada annexation):**
   - Suitability: High - Contemporary reference class
   - Pattern: Bold rhetorical claims → no formal offers → focus shifts to other issues
   - These remain rhetorical rather than formal diplomatic proposals

**Selected Reference Class:** Trump administration's recent pattern of territorial rhetoric (2025-2026), combined with the specific 2019 Greenland precedent.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 9 days (February 6 to February 15, 2026)

**Critical Timeline:**
- January 12, 2026: Question's "after" date begins
- January 14, 2026: NBC reports Rubio directed to develop proposal "in coming weeks"
- January 21-22, 2026: Trump announces "framework" focused on mineral rights/security, NOT sovereignty purchase
- February 1, 2026: Current community prediction at 25%
- February 6, 2026: Today
- February 15, 2026: Target date for this meta-question
- May 1, 2026: Deadline for underlying question

**Key Observation:** We are now ~23 days past the NBC report about developing a proposal "in coming weeks." The January 22 announcement of a "framework" appears to have been that proposal, but it focused on mineral rights/security arrangements rather than a sovereignty purchase.

## (d) Justification

**Factors Suggesting Community Prediction Will Rise Above 25%:**
1. Time pressure: Only 84 days remain until May 1 deadline
2. NBC's January 14 report explicitly stated developing a purchase proposal was "high priority"
3. Some forecasters may interpret the "framework" announcement as a precursor to a formal offer
4. Trump's unpredictability could lead to a formal offer even after pivoting to security arrangements

**Factors Suggesting Community Prediction Will Stay at or Below 25%:**
1. **Critical:** The January 22 "framework" announcement specifically focused on mineral rights and security, with diplomatic sources explicitly stating "no agreement for American control or ownership"
2. Denmark's consistent position: willing to negotiate security/economics but NOT sovereignty
3. The 2019 precedent: Trump's Greenland interest never materialized into a formal offer
4. The resolution criteria require a "formal proposal" that would transfer "sovereignty of greater than 50% of land area" - the current trajectory points toward security/mineral arrangements that fall short of this
5. Only 9 days for news to move the prediction significantly
6. Current prediction already at 25% suggests the community has priced in moderate probability

**Most Likely Scenario:** The community prediction will remain stable or decline slightly because:
- The most significant development (January 22 framework announcement) has already occurred and pointed AWAY from sovereignty purchase
- No new major developments in the past 15 days
- Sophisticated forecasters likely recognize the distinction between mineral rights/security deals vs. sovereignty transfer

Outside view calibration:

The current community prediction of 25% appears well-calibrated given:
1. The question asks whether the CP will be HIGHER than 25% on Feb 15
2. We need the CP to move UP from its current position
3. The most recent major development (Jan 22) suggested a pivot away from purchase toward security arrangements
4. Only 9 days remain for significant news to emerge
5. Even if some forecasters update upward on time pressure, others will likely update downward on the "framework" news if they haven't already

The base rate for Metaculus community predictions moving >0% in a 9-day window on geopolitical questions is relatively low absent major news. Given that the major news we have (Jan 22 framework) points against a purchase offer, I estimate:

- Probability of significant positive news in next 9 days: ~15%
- Probability CP rises above 25% even without major news (drift/time pressure): ~20%
- Probability CP stays at or below 25%: ~65%

Accounting for uncertainty and the possibility of unexpected developments (Trump announcement, leak of formal proposal, etc.), I calibrate toward:

Outside View Prediction:
34%
