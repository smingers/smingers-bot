Analysis:
### 1) Resolution-criteria paraphrase (guarding against bait-and-switch)
This meta-question resolves **Yes** if the **Metaculus community prediction (CP)** for “US offers to purchase Greenland” is **strictly > 25.00%** at **2026-02-15 08:04:34**; otherwise **No**.

We are **not** forecasting whether the US will offer; we are forecasting whether the **CP** will be **above** a fixed threshold on a specific timestamp.

## (a) Source analysis (facts vs opinions; quality; date)
**BBC (Jan 22, 2026)** – High-quality mainstream reporting.  
- *Facts:* Trump claimed a “framework of a future deal”; Rutte said sovereignty wasn’t discussed; Denmark/Greenland leaders reiterate sovereignty is a red line; NYT-sourced idea involves limited sovereignty over base areas (not purchase of >50% of Greenland).  
- *Relevance:* Suggests discussion is drifting toward **security/basing arrangements**, not a sovereign purchase offer.

**FactCheck.org (Jan 22, 2026)** – High-quality explainer; strong on treaty/legal context.  
- *Facts:* 1951 defense agreement already provides broad US access; experts argue “ownership” not needed.  
- *Relevance:* Increases plausibility that a *non-purchase* arrangement satisfies US goals → tends to **lower** probability of a formal purchase offer (and therefore may lower CP).

**Brookings (Jan 15, 2026)** – Think tank commentary/analysis; author opinion plus historical facts.  
- *Facts:* Truman made a secret offer in 1944/46-era; strong constraints (NATO, markets) can rein in Trump.  
- *Opinion:* Interprets market backlash/European unity as constraining Trump.  
- *Relevance:* Moderately negative for “formal offer soon” narrative.

**ABC News (late Jan / early Feb 2026)** – High-quality; includes sources familiar with discussions.  
- *Facts:* Danish FM says “fundamental disagreements”; working group to explore “common way forward”; importantly, a source says the US goal to buy was **never communicated to Copenhagen** and Denmark has **received no offer**.  
- *Relevance:* This is close to the resolution criteria and points away from “offer imminent,” likely pushing CP **down**.

**AskNews: Greenland poll (Feb 4–5, 2026; The Hill/others)** – Secondary reporting of a poll; likely credible methodology but still one poll.  
- *Facts:* ~76% oppose joining US; concerns about invasion.  
- *Relevance:* Makes Denmark/Greenland acceptance less likely; can reduce forecaster belief that a formal offer will be made (though an offer could be made even if rejected).

**AskNews: prediction market summary (Jan 19 / Feb 3, 2026)** – Mixed-quality commentary; markets are informative but questions differ.  
- *Facts:* Polymarket/Kalshi implied probabilities for “acquire Greenland” are relatively low.  
- *Limitation:* Market question often about **acquisition**, not “formal offer to purchase sovereignty >50%,” so it’s only indirectly relevant. Still, it reflects broad skepticism.

**Other AskNews historical pieces (Feb 6; Jan 7–23)** – Mostly background/history; limited direct incremental signal for CP movement by Feb 15.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
### Strong evidence (bigger shifts)
1) **ABC: “no offer communicated to Copenhagen / no offer of any kind” (as of late Jan/early Feb)**  
   - Directly bears on whether a formal offer is underway.  
   - Likely depresses near-term “offer soon” expectations → tends to pull CP **below** 25.

2) **Structural feasibility: Denmark + Greenland repeatedly state sovereignty is non-negotiable; existing 1951 agreement already gives US broad access** (BBC + FactCheck with identifiable officials/experts)  
   - Creates a strong alternative pathway (bases/security/minerals) that doesn’t require a sovereignty purchase offer.  
   - Tends to lower “offer” probability, hence CP.

### Moderate evidence
3) **“Framework of a future deal” signals active talks** (BBC; Trump statements)  
   - Ambiguous: could be misread as purchase momentum by some forecasters (upward pressure), but details reported point away from sovereignty purchase (downward pressure). Net: slight-to-moderate **down** for “purchase offer” but some volatility risk.

4) **Time decay toward May 1 deadline with no offer yet**  
   - Rationally, absent new pro-offer evidence, probability should drift **down** as the window shrinks.

### Weak evidence
5) **Greenland public opinion poll**  
   - Suggests rejection, but doesn’t prevent the US from *making* an offer; still, it can affect political incentives and forecaster sentiment.

6) **Prediction markets on acquisition**  
   - Directionally informative about skepticism, but mismatched instrument.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time until CP snapshot:** ~9 days (from 2026-02-06 to 2026-02-15).
- **How this changes if timeframe is halved (~4–5 days):** less time for any “surprise headline” or forecast churn; CP more likely to remain at/near 25 or drift slightly downward → **lower** chance of ending >25.
- **If doubled (~18 days):** more time for either (i) additional clarifying “not a purchase” reporting (downward drift) or (ii) a leak/announcement of an actual offer draft (upward jump). Given current evidence trend is clarifying away from purchase, I’d still expect **net downward**, but with slightly higher tail risk of a jump.

---

## (d) Justification (updating from outside view to inside view)
### Start from an anchor
Because the current CP is exactly **25.00%**, a naïve “random-walk” view would start near **50%** for “ends above vs at/below” (since any small movement could flip it). But that ignores directional pressure.

### Directional pressures over the next 9 days
- **Downward drift is more likely than upward drift** because:
  - ABC’s sourced claim that **no offer has been communicated** is a crisp, near-term negative signal.
  - The prominent “framework” reporting is increasingly interpreted as **security/basing/minerals**, not **purchase of sovereignty >50%** (the bar in the resolution criteria).
  - With time passing and no formal offer emerging publicly, forecasters often mark probabilities down.

### Upward risk exists but seems smaller
- Trump could create a **single-headline shock** (“we offered X for Greenland”), or a leak could suggest an offer memo is ready. That could push CP above 25 quickly. But we lack fresh signs pointing that way *between Feb 1 and Feb 6*; recent incremental info leans the other direction.

### Net inside-view adjustment
Relative to the outside-view 34% you provided, the **newest incremental evidence** in the packet (notably ABC’s “no offer communicated” + polling) is slightly more **downward** than upward for CP, so I move modestly toward **No**.

Probability calibration
- I estimate **~38%** that the Metaculus CP will be **>25.00%** on 2026-02-15.
- Interpretation: CP is more likely to be **25.00% or lower** than to tick upward, due to mild-but-real negative drift plus recent reporting suggesting no offer is in motion.

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: Will Metaculus CP for “US offers to buy Greenland” be **>25%** at **Feb 15, 2026 08:04:34**?
2) Outside view base rate used: Your outside-view “Yes” ~34%; my anchor also considered “at-threshold implies ~50% absent drift.”
3) Consistency: **38/100 times**, CP ends **above 25%** at the snapshot.
4) Key evidence (most important):
   - ABC source: Denmark received **no offer** / not communicated.
   - Reporting points to **security/basing/minerals** alternatives vs sovereignty purchase.
   - **Time decay** with no new pro-offer developments → drift down.
   - Denmark/Greenland “sovereignty red line” reduces plausibility of formal purchase offer.
5) Blind spot: A sudden Trump/public leak of a **formal purchase offer** could rapidly push CP well above 25%.
6) Status quo: With short horizon, CP tends to be sticky; absent big news, slight downward drift more plausible than upward.

Probability: 38%
