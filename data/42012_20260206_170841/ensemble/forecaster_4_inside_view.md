Analysis:  

(a) Source analysis (chronological, 2026 dates)  
1. BBC (22 Jan) – straight-news, high credibility. Reports Trump touting only a vague “framework”, Denmark/Greenland reiterate sovereignty is non-negotiable. (Strong factual, minimal opinion).  
2. FactCheck.org (22 Jan) – reputable non-partisan fact check. Shows existing 1951 treaty already gives the U.S. almost everything it wants; experts dismiss “must own to defend” claim.  
3. Brookings (15 Jan) – think-tank op-ed. Explains markets & EU push-back forced Trump to drop military threat. Useful as expert interpretation (moderate evid.).  
4. ABC News (~1 Feb) – mainstream. Quotes Danish FM after White-House meeting: “fundamental disagreements” remain, no offer received, working group to meet “within weeks”.  
5. Opinion Danmark poll (5 Feb) – identifiable methodology, 600 respondents. 76 % of Greenlanders oppose U.S. annexation. Solid single-source data (moderate evid.).  
6. AskNews bundle – other press items repeat the above themes; no article after 5 Feb claims a formal offer is imminent.  
All sources post-date the last community-prediction snapshot (1 Feb), so anything truly new should already have circulated among forecasters by now.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong-weight (pushes probability DOWN)  
• Multiple independent, reliable sources (BBC, ABC, Danish officials) say no formal offer has even been tabled; Denmark’s “sovereignty red line” reiterated.  
• Historical pattern: US attempts (1867, 1910, 1946, 2019) never succeeded; probability of an offer typically erodes as time passes without documents.  
• Structural: a qualifying offer would instantly provoke NATO/legal turmoil—high institutional friction.

Moderate-weight (UP)  
• Trump repeatedly states he “needs” Greenland and claims a draft is being prepared; anonymous NBC/Fox sourcing speaks of proposals “in coming weeks”.  
• Prediction and gambling markets still price a non-negligible chance (≈20 – 30 % for purchase by 2027).

Weak-weight (mostly DOWN)  
• Recent Greenland poll shows overwhelming local opposition, but that affects Danish politics more than U.S. decision-making.  
• Short-term base-rate: over nine days, Metaculus medians usually drift slowly; without fresh pro-offer news the default drift is slightly downward.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Question resolves in 9 days (15 Feb).  
• If the horizon were halved to 4–5 days I would shave 2 pp off the “>25 %” chance (fewer news cycles).  
• If doubled to 18 days I would add 4 pp (extra opportunity for a leak or dramatic tweet to bump the median).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view anchor (neutral volatility around a threshold) = 50 %.  
– 7 pp: expected slight downward drift with no qualifying developments (status-quo pull).  
– 5 pp: sticky median—“= 25 %” counts as failure for our side of inequality.  
+ 2 pp: tail risk of a sensational Trump post or credible leak in the coming week.  
Net → 40 %.  
Cross-check with historic Metaculus volatility (typ. 2–4 ppt/week for political questions) supports this.

Probability calibration  
“I expect that in roughly 40 of 100 comparable nine-day windows, the community prediction would end up strictly above 25 %.”  
My 90 % confidence range for the 15 Feb community prediction is 20 % – 29 %.

Checklist:  
1. Will CP of Q41514 exceed 25 % at 08:04 UTC on 15 Feb 2026?  
2. Base rate (neutral) 50 %.  
3. Consistency: 40/100 times threshold is exceeded – plausible.  
4. Key evidence: a) No formal offer acknowledged; b) sovereignty “red line” repeated; c) 1951 treaty already suffices; d) nine-day horizon limits upside.  
5. Blind spot: leaked draft offer emerges on 13–14 Feb, spike in forecasts pushes CP to ~28 %.  
6. Status-quo outcome is “≤ 25 %”; inertia favours that.

Probability: 40%
