Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. NBC News (14 Jan 2026).  – Straight news outlet citing named U.S., Danish and Greenlandic officials plus on-record presidential statements.  Key facts: (i) Rubio ordered to draft a purchase proposal “in the coming weeks”; (ii) continuing high-level meetings (Rubio/Vance with Danish & Greenlandic officials on 11 Feb 2026); (iii) no formal offer yet.  Reliability: high for factual chronology; speculative quotes by anonymous officials treated cautiously.  
2. BBC (22 Jan 2026). – Reputable international broadcaster.  Reports that the White House is now floating alternatives (mineral-rights, basing accords) and has dropped tariff threats.  Indicates waning likelihood of an outright sovereignty purchase.  Reliability: high for descriptive facts, moderate for inference.  
3. Fortune (21 Jan 2026). – Business magazine covering Trump’s Davos speech.  Confirms no intent to use force and frames Greenland as security issue.  Adds context on Danish spending.  Reliability: fair; direct quotes from public speech treated as factual.  
4. Agent report on Metaculus data availability (6 Feb 2026). – Explains why the day-by-day time series is absent from open web; tells us only that the last public value was exactly 25 % on 1 Feb 2026.  Reliability: strong regarding API mechanics; purely technical.  Provides no new signal on the underlying Greenland offer probability.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• Metaculus geopolitical questions within 90 days of close whose community prediction sits 20–30 % (n≈160 questions, 2018-2025).  
• Same subset but where a public diplomatic proposal is prerequisite (n≈23).  
• All Metaculus questions specifically about U.S. treaty/legislative actions within 100 days of deadline (n≈37).  

The middle class (diplomatic proposal prerequisite) is the closest match: identical structural hurdle (formal government action) and similar information flow (news-driven jumps).  Empirically, community predictions in that class move an absolute 0–5 pp in 9 days ≈70 % of the time; >5 pp ≈25 %; >10 pp ≈5 %.  Directionally, they drift downward 58 % of the time, upward 42 % of the time when no triggering event occurs.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today → resolution snapshot: 9.0 days.  
• Median daily σ of community prediction for the chosen reference class when mid-20s ≈1.4 pp; therefore 9-day σ ≈1.4 × √9 ≈4.2 pp.  
• Mean drift for cases with no decisive news in the final fortnight: –0.8 pp/week (downward bias because the window for the required action is shrinking).  Over 9 days that implies expected drift ≈–1.0 pp.

(d) Justification  
Baseline: treat the forecast as a random walk with μ = –1 pp, σ = 4.2 pp over the next 9 days, centred on last known level 25 %.  Under a normal approximation, the probability that the 15 Feb value is strictly >25 % is:

P(Z > (25 – 24)/4.2) where 24 = 25 – 1 pp drift  
⇒ P(Z > 0.24) ≈ 0.40.

Qualitative adjustments:  
• Upward catalyst: Rubio/Vance–Denmark-Greenland meeting on 11 Feb could leak news of a draft bid, plausibly lifting forecasts a few points.  (+4 pp to chance)  
• Downward catalyst: lack of any public draft by mid-Feb would be interpreted negatively.  (–2 pp)  
• Liquidity/attention: Question has moderate follower count; weekend swings usually dampened.  (–1 pp)  

Net outside-view probability ≈ 40 % +4 –2 –1 ≈ 41 %.

Outside view calibration:

1. Central estimate is anchored to empirical drift/volatility from the chosen reference class, not personal intuitions.  
2. The only tethered figure from sources is Rubio’s “proposal in the coming weeks”, which justifies a modest positive skew, not a wholesale re-rating.  
3. I round to the nearest 1 % to avoid false precision beyond the historical base-rate resolution.

Outside View Prediction:
