You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 25.00% on 2026-02-15 for the Metaculus question "Before May 1, 2026, will the United States offer to purchase Greenland from Denmark?"?

Question background:
Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency.

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41514
- Original question title: Before May 1, 2026, will the United States offer to purchase Greenland from Denmark?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-01: 25.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question resolves as **Yes** if, after January 12, 2026 and before May 1, 2026, the government of either Denmark or the United States (according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions)) publicly announces or acknowledges that the US has made an offer to purchase Greenland from Denmark.&#x20;

Original fine print: 
> An "offer" is defined as a formal proposal of monetary or any other consideration (including trades) by the US that, if accepted by Denmark, would lead to Denmark transferring [sovereignty](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sovereignty) of greater than 50% of the land area of Greenland to the US.&#x20;
> 
> Note that anything other than a purchase of sovereignty (for example a purchase of mineral rights or military base rights) does not count.&#x20;
> 
> Statements such as "Greenland is not for sale" do not count; the US must make a formal offer as described above.&#x20;

> 
> > Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers during a classified briefing on Capitol Hill earlier this week that the U.S. is seeking to purchase Greenland, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to ABC News.
> 
> > Rubio told reporters after a briefing Wednesday that buying the territory has always been President Donald Trump's intent all along.

> > "Well, that's always been the president's intent from the very beginning. He said it very early on. I mean, this is not new. He talked about it in his first term, and he's not the first U.S. president that has examined or looked at how could we acquire Greenland? There's an interest there," Rubio told reporters.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41514) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-15 08:04:34 is higher than 25.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 25.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-15 08:04:34, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

<Summary source="https://polymarket.com/event/will-the-us-acquire-any-part-of-greenland-in-2026">
## Summary of Polymarket Article

**Source:** Polymarket (prediction market platform)

**Market Question:** Will the US acquire part of Greenland in 2026?

**Key Facts:**

1. **Trading Volume:** $7,587,335 (as of article date)

2. **Resolution Date:** December 31, 2026, 11:59 PM ET

**Resolution Criteria:**

The market resolves "Yes" if the United States acquires control of any land territory that is part of Greenland by the deadline. Three types of acquisition qualify:

1. **Transfer of Sovereignty:** A binding agreement or legal instrument that brings a defined area of Greenland under formal U.S. sovereignty (e.g., as a U.S. state, territory, or possession), even if the effective date is after the market deadline.

2. **Acquisition of Primary or Exclusive Jurisdiction or Control:** A binding agreement establishing a defined area where the U.S. has primary or exclusive jurisdiction, such that Danish and Greenlandic legal authority does not apply except by U.S. permission, even if effective date is after deadline.

3. **Use of Force:** If the U.S. acquires primary or exclusive jurisdiction through force.

**What Does NOT Qualify:**
- Non-binding statements, negotiations, proposals, frameworks, or MOUs
- Basing rights, access agreements, SOFA-type arrangements, COFA-type arrangements, commercial concessions, or leases
- Any U.S. jurisdiction in Greenland that existed at market creation

**Examples of Qualifying Events:**
- A treaty or legislation making any portion of Greenland a U.S. territory or possession
- A Guantánamo-style arrangement establishing exclusive U.S. jurisdiction over a defined zone

**Resolution Sources:** Official information from U.S., Danish, and Greenlandic governments; consensus of credible reporting may also be used.

**Note:** This article does not contain opinions, statistics, or forecasts—it is purely the resolution criteria for a Polymarket prediction market. The market asks a different question than the Metaculus question (actual acquisition vs. offer to purchase), with a different timeframe (through end of 2026 vs. before May 1, 2026).

# Summary of NBC News Article: "Buying Greenland could cost as much as $700 billion"

**Date:** January 14, 2026

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Estimated Purchase Price:** $500 billion to $700 billion, according to three people familiar with the cost estimate generated by scholars and former U.S. officials
- This represents more than half the Defense Department's annual budget
- Greenland is an 800,000-square-mile island
- Greenland has approximately 57,000 residents
- Greenland has 27,000 miles of coastline
- **Public Opinion:** An independent poll from last year showed about 85% of Greenlanders reject becoming part of the U.S.
- The U.S. currently has a small military footprint at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland

## Official Statements and Named Sources:

- **Senior White House Official:** Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been directed to come up with a proposal in the coming weeks to purchase Greenland, describing it as a "high priority" for Trump

- **President Trump (Sunday statement to reporters):** "I'd love to make a deal with them. It's easier. But one way or the other, we're going to have Greenland."

- **Greenland Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt (Tuesday arrival in Washington):** "Greenland does not want to be owned by, governed by or part of the United States. We choose the Greenland we know today — as part of the Kingdom of Denmark."

- **Greenland Minister for Business and Mineral Resources Naaja Nathanielsen (Tuesday news conference in London):** Stated messages from the U.S. are causing concern for Greenlanders who are having trouble sleeping, describing it as "a massive pressure that we are under." Added "we have no intentions of becoming American."

- **Secretary of State Marco Rubio:** Confirmed that buying Greenland has always been Trump's intent, noting Trump discussed it in his first term and isn't the first U.S. president to examine acquiring Greenland

- **Ian Lesser (German Marshall Fund of the United States fellow):** Said prospects of using force are "still very small" and "unnecessary," warning it would create tensions within NATO and potentially end the alliance

## Key Developments:

- **Scheduled Meeting:** Rubio and Vice President JD Vance are scheduled to meet Wednesday with officials from Denmark and Greenland
- This follows lower-level discussions last week between Danish/Greenland officials and the White House National Security Council
- Trump appointed Louisiana Gov. Jeff Landry as a special envoy to Greenland in December
- **Congressional Response:** A bipartisan duo of senators introduced legislation Tuesday to prohibit the Defense Department from using funds to assert control over sovereign territory of a NATO member state without authorization

## Alternative Options Mentioned:

- **Compact of Free Association:** An agreement including U.S. financial assistance in exchange for security presence (similar to agreements with Marshall Islands, Micronesia, and Palau)
- Expanding military and security capabilities under current agreement

## Unnamed Source Opinion:

- A U.S. official familiar with the issue questioned the need for invasion: "Why invade the cow when they'll sell you the milk at relatively good prices?"

## Context:

- Greenland is a semi-autonomous territory of Denmark
- The U.S. in 1916 bought Caribbean islands from Denmark and acknowledged Danish interests in Greenland
- Trump's interest stems partly from concerns that if Greenland seeks independence, it could fall into hands of adversaries like Russia or China
- There is "a growing sense of inevitability in Europe and the U.S." that Trump will gain some ground in his Greenland aspirations

## Key Facts and Developments

**Trump's Announcement:**
- President Trump announced on Truth Social that the US has formed "the framework of a future deal" regarding Greenland and the Arctic Region
- Trump backed off his threat to impose tariffs on European allies (including Denmark, UK, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, Netherlands, and Finland) that had opposed his Greenland acquisition plans
- The threatened tariffs were scheduled to be 10% starting February 1, increasing to 25% from June 1

**Nature of Potential Deal:**
- Trump told reporters the possible deal could involve **mineral rights** rather than outright ownership
- He described it as "the ultimate long-term deal" focused on "security and minerals"
- According to US media reports, the plan could allow the US to build more military bases on Greenland
- Officials suggested a potential template similar to **British sovereign bases in Cyprus** (which remained under UK sovereignty after Cyprus independence in 1960)

**No Ownership Agreement:**
- Diplomatic sources told CBS (BBC's US partner) that **there was no agreement for American control or ownership** of Greenland
- NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte said the "issue [of Danish sovereignty] did not come up anymore" in his conversations with Trump
- Trump had previously dismissed leasing, saying "you defend ownership. You don't defend leases"

**Danish Position:**
- Danish Foreign Minister Lars Løkke Rasmussen: "Now, let's sit down and find out how we can address the American security concerns in the Arctic while respecting the red lines of the Kingdom of Denmark"
- Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen (Thursday): Denmark can negotiate on "everything political; security, investments, economy. But we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty"

**Greenlandic Response:**
- Greenlandic lawmaker Aaja Chenmitz questioned NATO's involvement: "NATO in no case has the right to negotiate on anything without us, Greenland. Nothing about us without us"

**NATO Statement:**
- NATO spokeswoman: "Negotiations between Denmark, Greenland, and the United States will go forward aimed at ensuring that Russia and China never gain a foothold - economically or militarily - in Greenland"

**Current US Military Presence:**
- The US already has more than 100 military personnel permanently stationed at Pituffik base in northwestern Greenland
- Under existing agreements, the US can bring as many troops as it wants to Greenland

**Trump's Davos Remarks:**
- Trump ruled out using military force to acquire Greenland: "I don't have to use force. I don't want to use force. I won't use force"
- He urged world leaders to allow US control, saying: "You can say yes and we will be very appreciative. Or you can say no and we will remember"

# Summary of Fortune Article: Trump's Davos Address on Greenland

**Key Facts and Statements:**

1. **Trump's Davos Speech (Wednesday):** President Trump addressed the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, making Greenland acquisition a central topic of his remarks.

2. **Military Force Clarification:** Trump explicitly stated he would NOT use military force to acquire Greenland:
   - "We probably won't get anything unless I decide to use excessive strength and force … but I won't do that. I don't want to use force. I won't use force."
   - This clarified previous ambiguity, as senior administration officials had earlier told reporters the U.S. military was "always an option."

3. **Historical Claims:** Trump provided his interpretation of WWII history:
   - Said Denmark fell to Nazi Germany "after just six hours of fighting"
   - Claimed U.S. forces "saved Greenland" during WWII
   - Called the U.S. decision to return Greenland to Denmark after WWII "stupid"
   - Asked "how ungrateful are they now?"

4. **Strategic Rationale:** Trump framed Greenland primarily as a national security interest rather than economic:
   - Described it as a "strategic bulwark between the U.S., Russia, and China"
   - Dismissed mineral wealth (including rare earths) as secondary to strategic defense
   - Claimed "American presidents have sought to purchase Greenland for nearly two centuries"

5. **Historical Context (Article's Fact-Check):** The article notes that while President Truman offered Denmark $100 million in gold in 1946 to buy Greenland, there has NOT been a continuous line of U.S. presidents "for nearly two centuries" formally trying to purchase the island.

6. **Denmark Defense Spending Criticism:** Trump criticized Denmark's defense commitments:
   - Claimed Denmark promised more than $200 million for Greenland's defense but "spent less than 1% of that amount"
   - Said "There's no sign of Denmark there"

7. **Denmark Defense Spending (Article's Context):** 
   - A Danish telecom and policy consultancy analysis confirms that by mid-2024, only about 1% of roughly $224 million pledged had been spent
   - However, Denmark has since committed additional multibillion-kroner programs (low billions of dollars) in 2024 and 2025 for Arctic vessels, drones, satellites, and personnel

8. **Danish Military Presence:** The article notes Denmark maintains significant presence in Greenland:
   - Operates Joint Arctic Command based in Nuuk (Greenland's capital)
   - Maintains patrol vessels, air surveillance, and military personnel in and around Greenland
   - Danish naval patrols and inspection vessels routinely operate in Greenlandic waters

**International Reactions:**

- Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has repeatedly rejected selling Greenland
- European leaders (Paris to London) issued reminders that territorial claims cannot be negotiated under pressure
- U.S. Congress members from both parties distanced themselves from Trump's rhetoric, emphasizing respect for self-determination and international law
- Concern over Trump's position is expected to continue despite the military force clarification

Query: Retrieve time-series of community prediction values and recent comments for Metaculus question 41514; list date-value pairs back to 2025-12-15, highlight any jumps over 30 % and attach corresponding comment excerpts.
The additional search round did not surface any material that changes the substantive conclusion reached earlier: the specific, day-by-day community–prediction history and the comment feed for Metaculus question 41514 remain absent from publicly indexed webpages.

1.  Evidence examined in this round  
    •  Two Effective Altruism Forum posts describe bulk analyses of Metaculus data and share links to GitHub/Colab notebooks that programmatically download question histories through the Metaculus API [EA Forum, 24 Mar 2023; EA Forum, 1 May 2023]. However, their shared datasets are aggregates covering thousands of questions; none contains raw history files or comment logs for the individual question ID 41514.  
    •  A news article in The Decoder summarises a Metaculus forecast on weak AGI [The Decoder, 26 Mar 2023]. The write-up cites the headline number “January 2026” but, again, provides no underlying JSON or CSV export and no question ID reference.  
    •  A generic Google result on “metaculus 41514 json history” returned no usable content.  
    •  No hit exposes the /history or /comments endpoints for ID 41514, either as a cache, screen-scrape, or static embed.

2.  What the search results do confirm  
    •  Metaculus does maintain an authenticated API that can deliver question-level histories; the EA Forum posts mention their notebooks calling “/questions/{id}/” with “include=history”, corroborating the endpoint’s existence.  
    •  Researchers outside Metaculus regularly use that endpoint after authenticating, which explains why internal tools see the data although the public web does not display it.  
    •  The public HTML interface for a Metaculus question never includes the full time series in the page source; only the current point estimate is rendered client-side. Therefore search engines cannot index the history.

3.  Gaps that still block fulfilment of the original brief  
    a.  The actual sequence of date–value pairs for question 41514 from 2025-12-15 to the present.  
    b.  The line-by-line comment log (text + timestamp) for the same question.  
    c.  Any metadata needed to verify whether the requested window lies inside the question’s open period (open date, close date, resolution status).  
    d.  Without (a) we cannot algorithmically flag ≥30-percentage-point jumps, and without (b) we cannot attach contemporaneous comment excerpts.

4.  Why another round of open-web searching is unlikely to help  
    •  The domain metaculus.com deliberately serves historical data only through authenticated JSON; no version of the public site has ever shown a scrollable or downloadable history table.  
    •  Caches (Google WebCache, Wayback Machine) only hold the rendered HTML at single points in time, not the underlying API payload.  
    •  Third-party mirrors that periodically snapshot the API (e.g., EA or academic projects) publish derived statistics, not the raw per-question history dumps. The two EA Forum projects linked above explicitly omit raw question histories to avoid bulk-data hosting costs.

5.  Viable paths to obtain the missing information  
    •  Direct API pull: acquire an account (free) on Metaculus, obtain the session cookie or API token, and query  
      – GET https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/41514/?include=history  
      – GET https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/41514/comments  
      The JSON returned will contain (i) arrays of “community_prediction” values keyed by ISO-date strings and (ii) a list of recent comments with author, creation time and markdown body.  
    •  Contact Metaculus staff or the question author to request an export if API access is impractical.  
    •  As a last resort, locate a collaborator who already maintains a private archive of all question histories and can share the slice for ID 41514.

6.  Assessment with respect to the user’s specification  
    Until one of the above retrieval methods is executed, it is impossible to generate the deliverables the user asked for:  
    •  “Retrieve time-series … back to 2025-12-15”: not available.  
    •  “Highlight any jumps over 30 %”: cannot compute.  
    •  “Attach corresponding comment excerpts”: source comments unavailable.  

In short, all publicly discoverable evidence—including this latest search—indicates that the requested data are sequestered behind Metaculus’ authenticated API and are not present on the open web. Additional unauthenticated Google searches are therefore unlikely to close the information gap; what is required is direct, credentialed API access or a privately shared data dump.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
