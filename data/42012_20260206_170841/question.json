    "description": "Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41514\n- Original question title: Before May 1, 2026, will the United States offer to purchase Greenland from Denmark?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-01: 25.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> This question resolves as **Yes** if, after January 12, 2026 and before May 1, 2026, the government of either Denmark or the United States (according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions)) publicly announces or acknowledges that the US has made an offer to purchase Greenland from Denmark.&#x20;\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> An \"offer\" is defined as a formal proposal of monetary or any other consideration (including trades) by the US that, if accepted by Denmark, would lead to Denmark transferring [sovereignty](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sovereignty) of greater than 50% of the land area of Greenland to the US.&#x20;\n> \n> Note that anything other than a purchase of sovereignty (for example a purchase of mineral rights or military base rights) does not count.&#x20;\n> \n> Statements such as \"Greenland is not for sale\" do not count; the US must make a formal offer as described above.&#x20;\n\nOriginal background: \n> ABC News: [Rubio says Trump wants to buy Greenland while White House dangles military option](https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/rubio-trump-buy-greenland-trump-push-military-option/story?id=128994685)\n> \n> > Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers during a classified briefing on Capitol Hill earlier this week that the U.S. is seeking to purchase Greenland, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to ABC News.\n> \n> > Rubio told reporters after a briefing Wednesday that buying the territory has always been President Donald Trump's intent all along.\n> \n> > \"Well, that's always been the president's intent from the very beginning. He said it very early on. I mean, this is not new. He talked about it in his first term, and he's not the first U.S. president that has examined or looked at how could we acquire Greenland? There's an interest there,\" Rubio told reporters.\n> \n> See also CNN: [The US has tried to acquire Greenland before \u2013 and failed](https://www.cnn.com/2026/01/07/politics/us-greenland-trump-denmark-history-hnk)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41514,\"question_id\":41258,\"last_cp\":0.25}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41514) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-15 08:04:34 is higher than 25.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 25.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-15 08:04:34, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.",
