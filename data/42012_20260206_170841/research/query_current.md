Analysis:
The Metaculus community prediction stands exactly at the 25 % threshold.  Movements of just a few percentage points are common on Metaculus when fresh headlines break, so the key is whether any credible hints of a renewed U.S. bid, diplomatic push, congressional action, or Danish reaction emerge between now (2026-02-06) and 2026-02-15.  Relevant information would include:  
• Public statements by White House, State Department, Pentagon or leading candidates about Greenland acquisition.  
• Leaked briefing notes, draft legislation, or budget items allocating funds for a purchase.  
• Danish or Greenlandic government comments signalling talks or rejecting fresh overtures.  
• Articles in major outlets (AP, Reuters, Politico, DR.dk, KNR, Berlingske) discussing renewed negotiations or an imminent offer.  
Even rumors of “serious discussion” often push Metaculus probabilities a few points.  Conversely, authoritative denials could nudge the figure down.  The three queries below aim to capture breaking coverage of such developments since January 2026.
