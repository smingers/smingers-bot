Analysis:
The forecasting hinge is whether the Metaculus community prediction for a very specific question creeps above 25 % during the next nine days.  
Useful historical context therefore includes:
• How the community prediction for that exact Metaculus question has been moving over time (trend, volatility, reactions to news).  
• Any very recent news (Feb 1–Feb 6 2026) that could plausibly bump the probability upward—e.g., fresh US-Danish diplomatic statements, congressional discussions, or leaked policy documents about buying Greenland.  
• Commentary or analysis pieces that connect such news to the likelihood of an offer.  
External macro-economic indicators are irrelevant here, so no FRED query is needed.
