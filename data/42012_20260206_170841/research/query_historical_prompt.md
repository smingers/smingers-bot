Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41514
- Original question title: Before May 1, 2026, will the United States offer to purchase Greenland from Denmark?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-01: 25.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question resolves as **Yes** if, after January 12, 2026 and before May 1, 2026, the government of either Denmark or the United States (according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions)) publicly announces or acknowledges that the US has made an offer to purchase Greenland from Denmark.&#x20;

Original fine print: 
> An "offer" is defined as a formal proposal of monetary or any other consideration (including trades) by the US that, if accepted by Denmark, would lead to Denmark transferring [sovereignty](https://www.britannica.com/topic/sovereignty) of greater than 50% of the land area of Greenland to the US.&#x20;
> 
> Note that anything other than a purchase of sovereignty (for example a purchase of mineral rights or military base rights) does not count.&#x20;
> 
> Statements such as "Greenland is not for sale" do not count; the US must make a formal offer as described above.&#x20;

> 
> > Secretary of State Marco Rubio told lawmakers during a classified briefing on Capitol Hill earlier this week that the U.S. is seeking to purchase Greenland, sources familiar with the matter confirmed to ABC News.
> 
> > Rubio told reporters after a briefing Wednesday that buying the territory has always been President Donald Trump's intent all along.
> 
> > "Well, that's always been the president's intent from the very beginning. He said it very early on. I mean, this is not new. He talked about it in his first term, and he's not the first U.S. president that has examined or looked at how could we acquire Greenland? There's an interest there," Rubio told reporters.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41514) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-15 08:04:34 is higher than 25.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 25.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-15 08:04:34, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-06. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-06 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write a series of search queries that will be used by your assistant to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether you wish to utilize google, google news or the agent to retrieve information.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model equipped with capable web crawlers and designed to generate lengthy, detailed responses. As such, you may use a longer query with detailed instructions. It is possible to ask multiple questions.
Nonetheless, you are advised to keep your query to at most four sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic indicators, financial data, interest rates, employment, GDP, inflation, trade statistics, or any quantitative economic metric, use FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) to retrieve official historical data. Your query should describe the economic indicator (e.g., "US unemployment rate" or "consumer price index") or use a known FRED series ID directly (e.g., "UNRATE" or "CPIAUCSL"). This returns historical data with computed statistics for establishing base rates.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () **on the same line as and after** the query. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for Agent. Add a FRED query if the question involves economic/financial data.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant historical context needed to generate an outside view.}

Search queries:
1. [Query details] (Google)
2. [Query details] (Google News)
3. [Query details] (Agent)
4. [economic indicator query] (FRED) -- only if question involves economic/financial data
