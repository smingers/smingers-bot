You can't defend it on a lease...legally\"\n\n**Facts (per article):**\n- The U.S. currently has a 1951 defense agreement granting broad military access to Greenland\n- The U.S. maintains Pituffik Space Base (formerly Thule Air Base) with about 130 active-duty servicemembers as of September\n- Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen (January 14): \"Under the 1951 defense agreement, the U.S. can always ask for increasing its presence in Greenland\"\n- Danish MEP Stine Bosse: The existing agreement allows \"the U.S. to deploy all the military forces they want\"\n\n### Expert Opinions on Ownership Necessity\n- **Mikkel Runge Olesen** (Danish Institute for International Studies, to NYT): \"The U.S. has such a free hand in Greenland that it can pretty much do what it wants\"\n- **John Bolton** (former Trump national security adviser, CNN, January 21): Called the ownership claim \"crazy talk,\" noting the U.S. defends Japan, South Korea, and European countries without owning them\n- **Ivo Daalder** (former U.S. ambassador to NATO under Obama, to WSJ): \"Merely suggesting that the U.S. can only be secure if it owns Greenland raises fundamental questions about its willingness to defend countries that it doesn't own\"\n- The U.S. has at least 128 military bases in 51 countries (2024 Congressional Research Service report)\n\n### White House Response\n- The White House provided a statement (no direct answer on whether the framework extends existing agreement): \"If this deal goes through...the United States will be achieving all of its strategic goals with respect to Greenland, at very little cost, forever\"\n- **NYT reporting (January 22, anonymous officials):** One negotiation point is giving the U.S. sovereignty over its military bases in Greenland\n\n### Additional Context\n- Greenland has approximately 56,000 residents\n- Renewed U.S. interest in Arctic due to \"great power competition\" and increased Russian military presence over past 10-15 years (Congressional Research Service, July report)\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-follows-president-trump-decision-to-step-back-from-threatening-to-use-force-in-greenland/\">\n# Summary of Brookings Article on Trump's Greenland Pursuit\n\n**Author:** William A. Galston  \n**Date:** January 15, 2026  \n**Source:** Brookings Institution\n\n## Key Facts and Timeline:\n\n- **Trump's Recent Actions:** Following a military operation in Venezuela against Nicolas Maduro, President Trump turned attention to Greenland, announcing intentions to either purchase it from Denmark or take it militarily.\n\n- **Trump's Retreat:** Trump took the military option off the table during a speech at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland this week. Hours after the Davos speech, he also withdrew threats of imposing tariffs on eight EU countries.\n\n- **Market Impact:** Stock market experienced a \"big fall\" in reaction to Trump's earlier threats, which likely influenced his decision to back down. The article notes this mirrors a previous pattern where adverse market reaction to his \"Liberation Day\" tariff pronouncement also caused Trump to reconsider.\n\n## Historical Context:\n\n- **1944 Truman Attempt:** President Harry Truman secretly offered Denmark $100 million for Greenland (Congress was unaware). Denmark declined and instead negotiated the 1951 \"Defense of Greenland Agreement,\" giving the U.S. essentially carte blanche for military presence.\n\n- **U.S. Military Presence:** During WWII and Cold War, the U.S. had up to fifty military installations in Greenland. Today, only one American air force base remains.\n\n- **1916 Danish West Indies Purchase:** The U.S. successfully purchased what became the U.S. Virgin Islands from Denmark for $25 million in gold coins, completed March 31, 1917. Secretary of State Lansing pressured Denmark by threatening occupation.\n\n## Current Situation Details:\n\n- **Greenland's Population:** Approximately 56,000 people\n- **NATO Implications:** An attack on Greenland would constitute a NATO member attacking another NATO member, effectively ending the alliance.\n- **\"Framework\" Claim:** Trump claimed to have achieved a \"framework\" for a deal, though exact contents remain elusive. Appears to include some sanctions on Russia and definitions regarding sovereignty for American military bases.\n- **European Position:** European leaders insist Greenland's sovereignty is crucial to any deal. Denmark has repeatedly stated Greenland is not for sale.\n\n## Factors Behind Trump's Retreat (According to Article):\n\n1. Threat of economic countermeasures by EU countries with significant U.S. trade ties\n2. Stock market reactions\n3. Coordinated opposition backed by sliding markets\n\n## Future Possibilities and Considerations:\n\n- **Trump's Options:** Continue attempting to purchase (despite Denmark's refusals), announce security enhancements in Greenland, or drop the issue entirely.\n\n- **European \"Bazooka Option\":** The EU's Anti-Coercion Instrument could restrict American products from EU countries. It has never been deployed but European leaders are discussing it in response to Trump's Greenland overreach.\n\n- **Upcoming Trade Deal:** A United States-European Union trade deal is due to be signed soon.\n\n## Analysis/Opinions (Author's perspective):\n\n- The article suggests that arguments claiming Trump is \"uniquely unconstrained in conducting American foreign policy might be slightly wide of the mark,\" noting that coordinated opposition backed by sliding markets appears to constrain him.\n\n- The author questions whether this episode marks \"the beginning of the end for NATO and the stable global trading order.\"\n\n- Galston suggests that if the episode deepens European unity and enables the continent to act with greater purpose, \"it may be Europe, not President Trump, that has the last laugh.\"\n\n- Notes that for Denmark and Greenland, the idea of \"selling\" citizens is \"an absolute non-starter.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86vvjxe9z7o\">\n# Summary of BBC Article: \"What we know about Trump's 'framework of a future deal' over Greenland\"\n\n**Date:** January 22, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**Trump's Announcement:**\n- President Trump announced on Truth Social that there is a \"framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland\" following talks at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland\n- The announcement came after a meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte\n- Trump did not provide specific details but said talks would continue\n\n**Positions of Key Parties:**\n- **NATO's Mark Rutte:** Said he did not discuss Danish sovereignty over Greenland in his meeting with Trump\n- **Danish PM Mette Frederiksen:** Stated Danes could negotiate on everything \"but we cannot negotiate on our sovereignty\"\n- **Greenland's PM Jens-Frederik Nielsen:** Echoed that sovereignty is \"a red line\" and significantly stated he did not know the details of the deal being discussed\n\n## Potential Deal Options (According to Sources):\n\n**Cyprus Model (per New York Times citing anonymous officials):**\n- One idea involves Denmark ceding sovereignty over small areas of Greenland where the US would build military bases\n- Similar to UK sovereignty over two bases in Cyprus since 1960\n\n**Arctic Security Enhancement:**\n- NATO allies have committed to boost security in the Arctic\n- Rutte stated the framework deal will require this contribution, hoping for implementation \"early in 2026\"\n- UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper mentioned setting up an \"Arctic Sentry\" similar to NATO's Baltic Sentry mission\n\n**Existing Arrangements:**\n- Under a 1951 agreement with Denmark, the US can send unlimited troops to Greenland\n- US already has 100+ military personnel at Pituffik base in northwestern Greenland\n- Discussions may center on renegotiating this 1951 agreement\n\n**Constitutional Challenges:**\n- Greenland has a constitutional ban on the sale of land\n- Article mentions Guant\u00e1namo Bay as a potential model (permanent lease agreement since 1903)\n\n## Trump's Stated Rationale:\n- Claims Greenland is essential for his planned \"Golden Dome\" defense system against missile attacks from Russia and China\n- Mentions threats from Chinese and Russian vessels around the island (though Denmark says there is no threat \"today\")\n- Notes the island has vast, largely untapped reserves of rare earth minerals crucial for technologies including mobile phones and electric vehicles\n- Trump stated US control \"puts everybody in a really good position, especially as it pertains to security and to minerals\"\n\n## Greenland's Concerns:\n- Foreign Minister Vivian Motzfeldt stated his government asked him to convey \"the red lines directly to President Trump,\" not to negotiate on their behalf\n- Concern expressed that negotiations about Greenland's future were being conducted in their absence\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/liveblog/2026/1/14/live-trump-says-control-of-greenland-vital-ahead-of-white-house-meeting\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Trump updates: Danish FM says Denmark, US still 'differ' over Greenland\"\n\n**Disclaimer**: The extracted content appears incomplete, showing primarily navigation elements and minimal article content.

The treaty explicitly included a clause in which the U.S. agreed not to oppose Denmark's political and economic interests in Greenland, effectively renouncing any claim to the territory. This agreement was driven by strategic concerns during World War I, particularly fears that Germany might seize Greenland. Although U.S. Secretary of State Robert Lansing attempted to include Greenland in the 1917 treaty, it was ultimately excluded due to practical and diplomatic considerations. The U.S. later established military bases in Greenland during World War II to prevent Nazi occupation, and in 1951 signed a defense agreement with Denmark, which led to the construction of military installations, including the unimplemented Project Iceworm. Greenland gradually gained autonomy, becoming a self-governing region within the Danish Realm in 2009. In early 2026, Donald Trump revived the idea of acquiring Greenland, citing Denmark's inability to defend it and the region's vast mineral resources such as rare earth elements, copper, and nickel. This renewed interest sparked speculation about purchase, occupation, or pressure tactics, though no concrete agreement has materialized. The article concludes by questioning how long this issue will remain on the international agenda.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 09:36 AM\nSource:[La Br\u00fajula Verde](https://www.labrujulaverde.com/2026/02/en-1917-estados-unidos-compro-las-islas-virgenes-a-dinamarca-y-el-tratado-incluia-la-no-reclamacion-de-groenlandia)\n\n**76% of Greenlanders Oppose U.S. Annexation, Survey Shows**\nA survey conducted by Opinion Danmark and published on February 5, 2026, reveals that 76% of Greenlanders believe that joining the United States would be unfavorable. Only 8% viewed U.S. acquisition positively, while 17% had no opinion. The survey, conducted in mid-January 2026, followed public statements by U.S. President Donald Trump, who reiterated his desire for the U.S. to gain control of Greenland during the World Economic Forum in Davos, stating he would not use force. The survey also found that 65% of respondents preferred closer cooperation with the European Union over the U.S., with only 5% supporting closer ties with the United States. Additionally, 54% of respondents expressed being very or somewhat concerned about the possibility of a U.S. military invasion, while 40% said they were not worried. The survey, conducted via phone and online with 600 participants, noted that public opinion polls in Greenland are rare due to high costs and logistical challenges in reaching residents scattered across remote settlements. According to analyst Sune Steffen Hansen, the renewed debate on Greenland\u2019s future likely only further discouraged Greenlanders from supporting U.S. integration.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 11:48 PM\nSource:[Bankier.pl](https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/Grenlandia-nie-chce-do-USA-76-proc-mieszkancow-przeciw-9079934.html)\n\n**Media Learned When Trump First Considered Controlling Greenland**\nAccording to Time, Donald Trump began considering the idea of acquiring Greenland during a conversation with his long-time acquaintance, Ronald Lauder, who highlighted Denmark's economic difficulties and suggested the U.S. could leverage the situation to pursue a deal. The magazine notes that despite critics dismissing the proposal as provocative, Trump treated it seriously. The idea of purchasing Greenland has historical precedents in the United States: in the 19th century, Secretary of State William Seward deemed it politically and economically justified, and in 1949, President Harry Truman offered Denmark $100 million in gold and oil rights to Alaska in exchange for Greenland.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 04:33 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20260205/tramp-2072554660.html)\n\n**Poll: 76% of Greenlanders Reject Becoming Part of the US**\nA poll conducted from January 18 to 28, 2026, among 610 adults in Greenland, revealed that 76% of respondents reject the idea of Greenland becoming part of the United States, while 16% said they do not know. Survey expert Sune Steffen Hansen, who conducted the poll, stated that the results show Greenlanders clearly reject U.S. acquisition and are generally satisfied with their current status. The survey also found that 54% of Greenlanders are 'worried' or 'very worried' about the possibility of the U.S. deploying military forces to take control, while 40% are not worried. The poll has a margin of error of \u00b14 percentage points. This comes amid repeated assertions by former U.S. President Donald Trump since 2019 that the U.S. should acquire Greenland for strategic, national security, and resource access reasons, citing advantages in the Arctic over China and Russia. Both Greenlandic and Danish leaders have firmly rejected the idea, calling it absurd and emphasizing that Greenlanders have the right to determine their own future. The U.S. already holds military rights in Greenland under a 1951 treaty, with consent from Denmark and Greenland, and has a military presence on the island.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 11:00 PM\nSource:[NewsMax](https://www.newsmax.com/world/globaltalk/greenland-poll-artic/2026/02/04/id/1244909/)\n\n**76 percent in Greenland oppose becoming part of US: Survey**\nA poll conducted from January 16 to January 28, 2026, among 610 adults in Greenland, found that 76% of respondents oppose the idea of Greenland becoming part of the United States, while only 8% support it and 16% are unsure. The survey, published by the Copenhagen Post and reported by The Hill, was released amid heightened tensions following President Donald Trump's public statements advocating for the U.S. to acquire Greenland for national security reasons, including countering Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic. Sune Steffen Hansen, the survey's lead researcher, stated that Greenlanders are 'quite satisfied' with their current status. The poll also revealed that only 10% of Greenlanders have a 'mainly' or 'very' positive view of the U.S. welfare system, including health care, elder care, and education. Greenland, a self-governing Danish territory, operates a Nordic-style welfare system funded largely by Denmark, which has pledged an additional 1.6 billion Danish crowns ($253 million) for health care and infrastructure through 2029. Danish Foreign Minister Lars L\u00f8kke Rasmussen expressed skepticism that the U.S. would fund such a system, stating, 'You haven't introduced a Scandinavian welfare system in your own country.' Trump initially refused to rule out military force to seize Greenland but later backtracked at the World Economic Forum in Davos, announcing a 'framework of a future deal' with NATO on security and mineral rights and walking back proposed tariffs on European allies. Despite this reversal, 54% of Greenlanders reported being worried or very worried about potential U.S. military deployment. Greenlandic Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen acknowledged ongoing pressure, stating, 'We are under pressure, serious pressure... as Greenland leaders, we have to deal with people who are afraid and scared,' while affirming that Greenland has 'red lines' it cannot cross but remains open to negotiation. The margin of error for the poll is approximately 4.0 percentage points.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 09:47 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/policy/international/5723278-greenland-us-territory-poll/)\n\n**The Greenland Crisis: The Future of Transatlantic Relations in Question**\nIn February 2026, a geopolitical crisis emerged over U.S. President Donald Trump's public declaration of interest in acquiring Greenland, including the possibility of using military force, citing national security concerns. This move constituted the first time the U.S. posed a direct security threat to a NATO ally, prompting Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen to invoke Article 5 of the NATO treaty, stating that an attack on Denmark is an attack on all NATO members. In response, eight NATO nations\u2014Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the UK, the Netherlands, and Finland\u2014conducted Operation Arctic Endurance in Greenland to counter the perceived threat, leading Trump to threaten tariffs on these countries. The crisis was resolved on February 21, 2026, when Trump announced a framework agreement with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. The agreement preserved Denmark\u2019s sovereignty and the principle of self-determination, meeting two of Denmark\u2019s red lines. Despite U.S. gains in Arctic influence, the crisis revealed structural weaknesses in transatlantic relations. Analyst Chen Wei-hsia argues that the U.S. withdrawal from its role as a provider of public goods\u2014such as security and a rules-based order\u2014has undermined the predictability of the international system. According to realist theory, European nations now face a strategic dilemma: either seek new alliances to rebalance power or maintain reliance on U.S. hegemony. Recent diplomatic actions\u2014such as Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney\u2019s visit to Beijing, French President Emmanuel Macron\u2019s China visit, and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer\u2019s return to China after eight years\u2014suggest a shift toward strategic autonomy. Carney, speaking at the World Economic Forum, advocated for 'realism based on values'\u2014a middle path where middle powers form flexible coalitions based on issue-specific cooperation rather than rigid blocs. This approach aligns with China\u2019s call for multilateralism and the Global South\u2019s aspirations, offering a potential model for future international relations. The crisis underscores the fragility of the postwar liberal order and the urgent need for middle powers to act collectively to preserve stability.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 09:20 PM\nSource:[\u98a8\u50b3\u5a92](https://www.storm.mg/article/11100069)\n\n**Get the Facts: What makes Greenland so valuable -- and why President Trump is interested**\nGreenland has gained significant global attention due to President Donald Trump's repeated statements since 2019 expressing interest in acquiring the Danish territory, with claims intensifying during the 2026 NATO conference in Davos, Switzerland. Trump cited Greenland's strategic location between the U.S., Europe, and Russia as critical for national security, stating that 'Russian and Chinese ships' are present in the region and emphasizing its importance for the 'Golden Dome missile shield,' according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. Greenland, part of the Kingdom of Denmark but self-governing, is 836,300 square miles\u2014larger than Texas, California, Montana, New Mexico, and Arizona combined\u2014and has a population of 57,000, 88% of whom are Greenlandic. Despite its sparse population, Greenland is rich in natural resources, including oil, gas, diamonds, lithium, gold, and zinc, though ice coverage and high extraction costs limit development. The U.S. currently maintains only one military base in Greenland\u2014Pituffik Space Base\u2014operated by the U.S. Space Force since 2020, under a 1951 agreement. Greenland lacks its own full military and relies on Denmark\u2019s defense system. The Greenlandic and Danish governments oppose any transfer of sovereignty. A 2025 poll found 85% of Greenlanders oppose joining the U.S., while a slight majority support independence. The U.S. has pursued Greenland at least four times since 1867, including during William H. Seward\u2019s tenure after the Alaska purchase. Russian President Vladimir Putin dismissed the acquisition attempt as 'doesn't concern us at all.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 08:05 PM\nSource:[Pittsburgh's Action News 4](https://www.wtae.com/article/greenland-trump-explainer/70097863)\n\n**Get the Facts: What makes Greenland so valuable \u2014 and why President Trump is interested**\nPresident Donald Trump has expressed ongoing interest in gaining control of Greenland since 2019, with renewed attention in early 2026. At the 2026 NATO conference in Davos, Trump claimed the U.S. would soon take over Greenland, citing its strategic location between the U.S., Europe, and Russia as critical for national security. He also stated that Greenland is 'essential for the Golden Dome missile shield,' according to U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent. The U.S. currently maintains the Pituffik Space Base in Greenland under a 1951 Defense of Greenland agreement with NATO, and since 2020, it has been operated by the U.S. Space Force.

A 2025 poll found that 85% of Greenlanders oppose joining the U.S., while a majority support independence. The Danish and Greenlandic governments strongly oppose any shift in sovereignty. In response to opposition, Trump canceled new tariffs on eight European nations scheduled for February 1, 2026. A proposed compromise discussed among NATO members involves Denmark and the alliance working with the U.S. to build additional U.S. military bases on Greenland. The White House claims such a deal would achieve U.S. strategic goals at minimal long-term cost.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 08:05 PM\nSource:[ketv.com](https://www.ketv.com/article/greenland-trump-explainer/70097863)\n\n**'Will the U.S. Buy Greenland?' The Million-Dollar Betting Business on Trump's Decisions and the Role of His Son**\nA new betting business centered on U.S. political decisions has emerged on two American platforms: Polymarket and Kalshi. Donald Trump Jr. serves as an advisor for both platforms and is overseeing the launch of a third. The most prominent bet asks whether 'The United States will purchase part of Greenland by 2026?', with implied probabilities at 21%, offering nearly fivefold returns for successful bets. The total financial volume on this question reached seven million dollars. Another major bet predicts that the next country to be bombed by the U.S. will be Somalia (85% of bets, lower payout) or Syria (6% of bets, potential return over tenfold if correct).\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 12:15 PM\nSource:[Corriere della Sera](https://www.corriere.it/economia/finanza/26_febbraio_03/gli-usa-acquisteranno-la-groenlandia-il-business-milionario-delle-scommesse-sulle-decisioni-di-trump-e-il-ruolo-del-figlio-b8e4b550-3d71-477b-b2be-9833fb6d4xlk.shtml)\n\n**Before Trump, the U.S. Already Tried to Buy Greenland**\nBefore Donald Trump's recent interest, the United States had previously sought to purchase Greenland from Denmark. The earliest attempts date back to the 19th century, shortly after the U.S. acquired Alaska from Russia. Then-Secretary of State William H. Seward proposed buying Greenland from Denmark, but the deal failed. The interest resurfaced after World War II, when President Harry Truman offered $100 million in gold for the island. According to National Archives documents, U.S. advisors valued Greenland\u2019s strategic geographic position for defending against potential Soviet strategic bombers over the Arctic Circle. The offer was again rejected by Denmark, which retains control over the territory. According to sources cited by NBC News, the Trump administration reportedly considered paying $700 billion for Greenland in a new round of negotiations. Trump had expressed interest during his first term in 2019 and intensified efforts after returning to the White House in January 2025. However, both the Danish and Greenlandic governments affirm that Greenland\u2019s sovereignty is not up for discussion, though they remain open to dialogue on Arctic security. On January 23, 2026, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen agreed with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte that the alliance must strengthen Arctic security against threats from Russia and China. Reuters reported that Rutte and Trump also agreed during the World Economic Forum in Davos to hold new talks among the U.S., Denmark, and Greenland to update the 1951 agreement governing U.S. military presence and access on the island.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 23, 2026 08:03 PM\nSource:[R7 Not\u00edcias](https://noticias.r7.com/internacional/antes-de-trump-eua-ja-tentaram-comprar-a-groenlandia-23012026/)\n\n**Greenland: The Danish Central Bank Prepared for an Arctic Monetary Conflict**\nOn the Polymarket prediction platform, traders have assessed the probability of the United States acquiring Greenland by 2026 to range between 1 in 4 and 1 in 3. The Danish Central Bank, responsible for financial stability, views the issue not primarily as an economic matter but as one with broader implications, though the specific nature of these implications is not detailed in the provided text.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 21, 2026 06:00 AM\nSource:[LesEchos.fr](https://www.lesechos.fr/finance-marches/marches-financiers/groenland-la-banque-du-danemark-prete-a-faire-face-a-une-guerre-monetaire-arctique-2210881)\n\n**Prediction Markets Not Too Confident President Trump Will Acquire Greenland**\nPresident Donald Trump has escalated tensions by threatening tariffs on seven NATO ally countries\u2014Denmark, the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Norway, the Netherlands, and Finland\u2014unless a deal to acquire Greenland is reached, despite Greenland\u2019s autonomy and exclusion from the list. If no agreement is made, a 10% tariff on goods from these nations would begin on February 1, 2026, rising to 25% by June 1, 2026. The European Union labeled the threats as blackmail, and the UK called them 'totally wrong.' While the U.S. has a history of territorial acquisition and strategic interest in Greenland due to rising threats from China and Russia, analysts argue Trump\u2019s aggressive tactics may undermine diplomatic objectives. France and Germany have threatened retaliation, and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer warned of a damaging trade war. Prediction markets reflect skepticism: Polymarket gives Trump a 21% chance of acquiring Greenland before 2027, while Kalshi estimates 13% before May 1, 2026, 28% before 2027, and 41% before January 20, 2029. A Quinnipiac poll conducted on January 14, 2026, showed limited public support for the acquisition, reinforcing perceptions of Trump\u2019s unpredictability and tendency to reverse course when faced with strong opposition.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 19, 2026 02:56 PM\nSource:[Crowdfund Insider](https://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2026/01/257548-prediction-markets-not-too-confident-president-trump-will-acquire-greenland/)\n\n**Trump\u2019s Greenland threats show Europe must prepare for Nato\u2019s end**\nDonald Trump's repeated threats to acquire Greenland, as reported in an interview with the Financial Times on January 18, 2026, are portrayed not as a mere distraction but as a personal priority driven by a desire for political and national glory. The article argues that Trump's stated justifications\u2014such as the need for a US missile defense system ('Golden Dome') and mining concessions\u2014are secondary to his real motive: expanding U.S. territory by 840,000 square miles through coercion of a close ally, Denmark. The article notes that existing U.S.-Denmark treaties already provide early warning systems in northern Greenland, and Denmark has offered to upgrade them, rendering the defense rationale weak. Similarly, mining concessions are not a core issue. The author, Anatol Lieven, contends that if Denmark is forced to sell Greenland under military pressure and NATO allies fail to respond decisively, Europe will suffer a profound humiliation. Alternatively, a strong response\u2014such as deploying visible military forces to Greenland to signal readiness to fight\u2014could deter U.S. aggression by forcing U.S. military and political leaders to reconsider the cost of killing NATO allies. The article frames this situation as a warning to Europe: if NATO cannot stand up to a U.S. president acting unilaterally, the alliance\u2019s credibility is at risk.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 18, 2026 04:00 PM\nSource:[unherd.com](https://unherd.com/newsroom/trumps-greenland-threats-show-europe-must-prepare-for-natos-end/)\n\n**Trump's Greenland Ultimatum: 10% Tariff on Non-Compliant Nations Starting February 1, 2026**\nFormer U.S. President Donald Trump, in a post on Truth Social, claimed that the United States has subsidized Denmark and other countries for decades without receiving compensation, and now demands that Denmark repay this 'debt' by allowing the U.S. to purchase Greenland. Trump warned that China and Russia are interested in Greenland, and that Denmark cannot protect it alone. He asserted that the U.S., under his leadership, is the only nation capable of securing the region, citing national security concerns. Trump announced that starting February 1, 2026, a 10% customs duty would be imposed on all goods sent from Denmark, Norway, Sweden, France, Germany, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, and Finland to the U.S., increasing to 25% by June 1, 2026, until a full purchase agreement is reached. He claimed the U.S. has pursued this acquisition for over 150 years, with many presidents attempting it, but Denmark consistently refused. Trump emphasized that modern defense systems, including the 'Golden Dome,' require Greenland\u2019s inclusion to function at maximum efficiency, and that the U.S. remains open to negotiations despite the decades of protection provided to these nations. The post was published on January 17, 2026, by CNN T\u00fcrk.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 17, 2026 04:39 PM\nSource:[CNN T\u00fcrk](https://www.cnnturk.com/dunya/son-dakika-trumptan-gronland-tehdidi-plani-desteklemeyen-ulkelere-yuzde-10-vergi-2385957)\n\n**Would Buying Greenland Be a Good Business Deal for the U.S.? Trump\u2019s Revived Proposal Sparks Geopolitical Tensions**\nDonald Trump has revived his proposal to purchase Greenland from Denmark, citing a valuation of $700 billion based on the island's strategic location, vast reserves of rare earth elements (estimated at 36\u201342 million tons of oxides), uranium, oil, and natural gas, and newly accessible Arctic maritime routes due to melting ice. The U.S. argues the acquisition is vital for national security and reducing dependence on China, which dominates the global rare earth market. However, Denmark and Greenland's Inuit population strongly reject the offer, viewing it as a threat to sovereignty. A 2025 survey showed 85% of Greenlanders oppose annexation, with Inuit leaders like Aqqaluk Lynge warning that U.S. influence would 'annihilate our people' and clash with their communal, non-privatized land values. In response, Europe has intensified military cooperation through NATO exercises involving France, Germany, Sweden, and Norway, while Canada and France have opened consulates in Nuuk. Denmark reaffirms that sovereignty is non-negotiable, and Greenland seeks greater autonomy through sustainable sectors like fishing, tourism, and renewable energy. Trump remains defiant, asserting he will 'get it one way or another,' and has linked Greenland to his 'Golden Dome' missile defense system. Despite U.S. diplomatic outreach led by Marco Rubio and JD Vance, progress remains limited. The historical legacy of Danish colonialism, including forced assimilation and sterilizations, continues to shape Greenland\u2019s political identity. While Trump sees the purchase as a strategic investment akin to past U.S. acquisitions like Alaska and Louisiana, Greenland\u2019s future remains contested between climate-driven geopolitical competition and Indigenous self-determination.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 16, 2026 09:52 AM\nSource:[Periodista digital](https://www.periodistadigital.com/economia/20260116/seria-buen-negocio-eeuu-comprar-groenlandia-propone-trump-noticia-689405172473/)\n\n**The Three Times the United States Tried to Buy Greenland**\nU.S. President Donald Trump reiterated on January 14, 2026, his intention to acquire Greenland from Denmark 'one way or another,' a proposal that has historical precedent. This is not the first time the United States has shown interest in Greenland, the world\u2019s largest island, which is approximately 84% covered by ice. The interest stems from strategic and resource-related motivations. The first recorded attempt dates to 1867\u20131868, shortly after the U.S. purchase of Alaska from Russia, when Secretary of State William Seward considered acquiring Greenland due to its natural resources, including coal, though no formal offer was made. The second attempt occurred in 1910 under President William Howard Taft, when a land-exchange proposal was made, but was rejected by Denmark. The third and most concrete effort came in 1946, when President Harry Truman offered $100 million to Denmark for Greenland, citing its strategic military value during World War II, particularly its role as a refueling station for transatlantic flights. Denmark rejected the offer, but the U.S. retained military access, including the continued presence at Pituffik Space Base, the northernmost U.S. Department of Defense installation. In 2025, Trump revived the idea, which he had previously raised in 2019, amid broader geopolitical tensions including threats toward Venezuela and concerns over reducing dependence on China. Greenland, while autonomous with its own parliament and government, remains under Danish control for foreign and defense policy. On January 13, 2026, Greenland\u2019s major political parties issued a joint statement titled 'We are united as a people,' firmly rejecting Trump\u2019s proposal. The U.S. interest in Greenland is driven by its strategic location between Europe and North America, critical for missile defense systems, and its rich mineral resources, which align with U.S. efforts to diversify supply chains away from China.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 12:29 AM\nSource:[El Destape](https://www.eldestapeweb.com/internacionales/estados-unidos/las-tres-veces-que-estados-unidos-intento-comprar-groenlandia-2026113205151)\n\n**Why Europe\u2019s best bet is negotiation as US eyes Greenland**\nIn January 2026, the United States' renewed interest in acquiring Greenland, highlighted by Stephen Miller, a senior aide to President Donald Trump, sparked alarm across Europe. Miller publicly questioned Denmark\u2019s sovereignty over Greenland and asserted that 'Greenland should be part of the United States,' escalating tensions. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who had previously attempted quiet diplomacy, was reportedly 'visibly frazzled' by the remarks. European leaders, including French Foreign Minister Jean-No\u00ebl Barrot and EU President Ursula von der Leyen, expressed strong opposition to any forcible takeover, with Barrot stating, 'Greenland is not for sale, nor is it for the taking,' and referencing the 1803 Louisiana Purchase as a historical analogy. The European Union, while not united on a response, has pursued diplomatic avenues: offering potential economic incentives, proposing enhanced NATO military presence in Greenland to counter Chinese and Russian influence, and discussing Greenland\u2019s mineral resources as a bargaining chip. One idea under consideration is altering Greenland\u2019s legal status to allow U.S. operational access without formal ownership. Denmark\u2019s Defense Ministry has warned that any invasion would be met with immediate resistance. Despite the lack of evidence of an imminent invasion, European officials are working behind the scenes to avoid confrontation through negotiation, balancing the need for U.S. cooperation on Ukraine with the imperative to defend sovereignty. The North Atlantic Council met in Brussels to discuss options, and diplomatic efforts continue, including high-level talks between U.S. lawmakers and Danish officials. The core European consensus is that negotiation is the best path forward to prevent a damaging political rupture.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 11, 2026 06:00 PM\nSource:[midwesttimes.com.au](https://www.midwesttimes.com.au/news/world/donald-trumps-greenland-ambitions-rattle-europe-as-leaders-push-for-diplomacy-c-21273693)\n\n**U.S. to Consult Denmark on Potential Purchase of Greenland**\nThe White House spokesperson, Levitt, announced on January 7, 2026, that President Trump and the national security team are actively discussing the possibility of purchasing Greenland, an autonomous territory of Denmark. The U.S. and Danish governments plan to hold consultations on the issue around the following week. Levitt explained that the U.S. has long maintained that containing Russian and Chinese influence in the Arctic aligns with American national interests, making the purchase a topic of discussion. She noted that the idea is not new\u2014U.S. presidents in the 1800s, including Andrew Johnson after the Alaska purchase, had previously pursued the acquisition. After World War II, President Truman offered $100 million (equivalent to over $2 billion today) for Greenland, but the offer was rejected. The U.S. government has not ruled out the use of military force, with Levitt stating that 'all options are on the table' to serve national interests. U.S. Secretary of State Rubio confirmed on January 7 that high-level talks with Denmark are scheduled for the coming week and emphasized that 'any U.S. president has the option to take military action if Greenland is seen as a threat to national security.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 08, 2026 06:26 AM\nSource:[Nikkei Chinese](https://cn.nikkei.com/politicsaeconomy/politicsasociety/60995-2026-01-08-14-09-04.html)\n\n**U.S. Has Tried to Buy Greenland Before \u2014 and Failed**\nThe article details the long-standing U.S. interest in acquiring Greenland, tracing it back to the 19th century. In 1867, after purchasing Alaska from Russia, Secretary of State William H. Seward proposed buying Greenland and Iceland from Denmark, citing strategic and economic advantages, including rich mineral resources and a vast coastline ideal for fishing and trade. Though no formal offer was made, the idea persisted. In 1910, U.S. Ambassador Maurice Francis Egan suggested trading Mindanao (then a U.S. territory) for Greenland and the Danish West Indies, but the proposal was shelved due to World War I. During the Cold War, in 1946, President Harry Truman offered Denmark $100 million in gold for Greenland, emphasizing its strategic importance for U.S. national security and the ability to launch aerial counteroffensives in the Arctic. Denmark rejected the offer, but allowed the U.S. to maintain military bases, including the Thule Air Base (now Pituffik Space Base), which remains operational. In 1979, Greenland gained autonomy from Denmark. Under Donald Trump, the interest resurged: in 2019, Trump first publicly expressed interest in buying Greenland, calling it a 'great real estate deal.' After winning the 2024 election, he revived the proposal, and in a January 2025 press conference at Mar-a-Lago, he hinted at military intervention, stating, 'I think we\u2019re going to get it. One way or another, we\u2019re going to get it.' The White House, through spokesperson Karoline Leavitt, confirmed that acquiring Greenland remains a national security priority and that the use of U.S. military forces is a potential option. Greenland\u2019s government and Denmark have consistently rejected the idea, affirming that Greenland is not for sale.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 07, 2026 02:36 PM\nSource:[CNN Espa\u00f1ol](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2026/01/07/eeuu/estados-unidos-adquirir-groenlandia-fracasado-trax)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
