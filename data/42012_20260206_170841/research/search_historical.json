Three types of acquisition qualify:\n\n1. **Transfer of Sovereignty:** A binding agreement or legal instrument that brings a defined area of Greenland under formal U.S. sovereignty (e.g., as a U.S. state, territory, or possession), even if the effective date is after the market deadline.\n\n2. **Acquisition of Primary or Exclusive Jurisdiction or Control:** A binding agreement establishing a defined area where the U.S. has primary or exclusive jurisdiction, such that Danish and Greenlandic legal authority does not apply except by U.S. permission, even if effective date is after deadline.\n\n3. **Use of Force:** If the U.S. acquires primary or exclusive jurisdiction through force.\n\n**What Does NOT Qualify:**\n- Non-binding statements, negotiations, proposals, frameworks, or MOUs\n- Basing rights, access agreements, SOFA-type arrangements, COFA-type arrangements, commercial concessions, or leases\n- Any U.S. jurisdiction in Greenland that existed at market creation\n\n**Examples of Qualifying Events:**\n- A treaty or legislation making any portion of Greenland a U.S. territory or possession\n- A Guant\u00e1namo-style arrangement establishing exclusive U.S. jurisdiction over a defined zone\n\n**Resolution Sources:** Official information from U.S., Danish, and Greenlandic governments; consensus of credible reporting may also be used.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This article does not contain opinions, statistics, or forecasts\u2014it is purely the resolution criteria for a Polymarket prediction market. The market asks a different question than the Metaculus question (actual acquisition vs. offer to purchase), with a different timeframe (through end of 2026 vs. before May 1, 2026).\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/buying-greenland-cost-much-700-billion-rcna253921\">\n# Summary of NBC News Article: \"Buying Greenland could cost as much as $700 billion\"\n\n**Date:** January 14, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- **Estimated Purchase Price:** $500 billion to $700 billion, according to three people familiar with the cost estimate generated by scholars and former U.S. officials\n- This represents more than half the Defense Department's annual budget\n- Greenland is an 800,000-square-mile island\n- Greenland has approximately 57,000 residents\n- Greenland has 27,000 miles of coastline\n- **Public Opinion:** An independent poll from last year showed about 85% of Greenlanders reject becoming part of the U.S.\n- The U.S. currently has a small military footprint at Pituffik Space Base in Greenland\n\n## Official Statements and Named Sources:\n\n- **Senior White House Official:** Secretary of State Marco Rubio has been directed to come up with a proposal in the coming weeks to purchase Greenland, describing it as a \"high priority\" for Trump\n\n- **President Trump (Sunday statement to reporters):** \"I'd love to make a deal with them.

I don't want to use force. I won't use force.\"\n   - This clarified previous ambiguity, as senior administration officials had earlier told reporters the U.S. military was \"always an option.\"\n\n3. **Historical Claims:** Trump provided his interpretation of WWII history:\n   - Said Denmark fell to Nazi Germany \"after just six hours of fighting\"\n   - Claimed U.S. forces \"saved Greenland\" during WWII\n   - Called the U.S. decision to return Greenland to Denmark after WWII \"stupid\"\n   - Asked \"how ungrateful are they now?\"\n\n4. **Strategic Rationale:** Trump framed Greenland primarily as a national security interest rather than economic:\n   - Described it as a \"strategic bulwark between the U.S., Russia, and China\"\n   - Dismissed mineral wealth (including rare earths) as secondary to strategic defense\n   - Claimed \"American presidents have sought to purchase Greenland for nearly two centuries\"\n\n5. **Historical Context (Article's Fact-Check):** The article notes that while President Truman offered Denmark $100 million in gold in 1946 to buy Greenland, there has NOT been a continuous line of U.S. presidents \"for nearly two centuries\" formally trying to purchase the island.\n\n6. **Denmark Defense Spending Criticism:** Trump criticized Denmark's defense commitments:\n   - Claimed Denmark promised more than $200 million for Greenland's defense but \"spent less than 1% of that amount\"\n   - Said \"There's no sign of Denmark there\"\n\n7. **Denmark Defense Spending (Article's Context):** \n   - A Danish telecom and policy consultancy analysis confirms that by mid-2024, only about 1% of roughly $224 million pledged had been spent\n   - However, Denmark has since committed additional multibillion-kroner programs (low billions of dollars) in 2024 and 2025 for Arctic vessels, drones, satellites, and personnel\n\n8. **Danish Military Presence:** The article notes Denmark maintains significant presence in Greenland:\n   - Operates Joint Arctic Command based in Nuuk (Greenland's capital)\n   - Maintains patrol vessels, air surveillance, and military personnel in and around Greenland\n   - Danish naval patrols and inspection vessels routinely operate in Greenlandic waters\n\n**International Reactions:**\n\n- Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has repeatedly rejected selling Greenland\n- European leaders (Paris to London) issued reminders that territorial claims cannot be negotiated under pressure\n- U.S. Congress members from both parties distanced themselves from Trump's rhetoric, emphasizing respect for self-determination and international law\n- Concern over Trump's position is expected to continue despite the military force clarification\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve time-series of community prediction values and recent comments for Metaculus question 41514; list date-value pairs back to 2025-12-15, highlight any jumps over 30 % and attach corresponding comment excerpts.\nThe additional search round did not surface any material that changes the substantive conclusion reached earlier: the specific, day-by-day community\u2013prediction history and the comment feed for Metaculus question 41514 remain absent from publicly indexed webpages.\n\n1.  Evidence examined in this round  \n    \u2022  Two Effective Altruism Forum posts describe bulk analyses of Metaculus data and share links to GitHub/Colab notebooks that programmatically download question histories through the Metaculus API [EA Forum, 24 Mar 2023; EA Forum, 1 May 2023]. However, their shared datasets are aggregates covering thousands of questions; none contains raw history files or comment logs for the individual question ID 41514.  \n    \u2022  A news article in The Decoder summarises a Metaculus forecast on weak AGI [The Decoder, 26 Mar 2023]. The write-up cites the headline number \u201cJanuary 2026\u201d but, again, provides no underlying JSON or CSV export and no question ID reference.  \n    \u2022  A generic Google result on \u201cmetaculus 41514 json history\u201d returned no usable content.  \n    \u2022  No hit exposes the /history or /comments endpoints for ID 41514, either as a cache, screen-scrape, or static embed.\n\n2.  What the search results do confirm  \n    \u2022  Metaculus does maintain an authenticated API that can deliver question-level histories; the EA Forum posts mention their notebooks calling \u201c/questions/{id}/\u201d with \u201cinclude=history\u201d, corroborating the endpoint\u2019s existence.  \n    \u2022  Researchers outside Metaculus regularly use that endpoint after authenticating, which explains why internal tools see the data although the public web does not display it.  \n    \u2022  The public HTML interface for a Metaculus question never includes the full time series in the page source; only the current point estimate is rendered client-side. Therefore search engines cannot index the history.\n\n3.  Gaps that still block fulfilment of the original brief  \n    a.  The actual sequence of date\u2013value pairs for question 41514 from 2025-12-15 to the present.  \n    b.  The line-by-line comment log (text\u2009+\u2009timestamp) for the same question.  \n    c.  Any metadata needed to verify whether the requested window lies inside the question\u2019s open period (open date, close date, resolution status).  \n    d.  Without (a) we cannot algorithmically flag \u226530-percentage-point jumps, and without (b) we cannot attach contemporaneous comment excerpts.\n\n4.  Why another round of open-web searching is unlikely to help  \n    \u2022  The domain metaculus.com deliberately serves historical data only through authenticated JSON; no version of the public site has ever shown a scrollable or downloadable history table.  \n    \u2022  Caches (Google WebCache, Wayback Machine) only hold the rendered HTML at single points in time, not the underlying API payload.  \n    \u2022  Third-party mirrors that periodically snapshot the API (e.g., EA or academic projects) publish derived statistics, not the raw per-question history dumps. The two EA Forum projects linked above explicitly omit raw question histories to avoid bulk-data hosting costs.\n\n5.  Viable paths to obtain the missing information  \n    \u2022  Direct API pull: acquire an account (free) on Metaculus, obtain the session cookie or API token, and query  \n      \u2013 GET https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/41514/?include=history  \n      \u2013 GET https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/41514/comments  \n      The JSON returned will contain (i) arrays of \u201ccommunity_prediction\u201d values keyed by ISO-date strings and (ii) a list of recent comments with author, creation time and markdown body.  \n    \u2022  Contact Metaculus staff or the question author to request an export if API access is impractical.  \n    \u2022  As a last resort, locate a collaborator who already maintains a private archive of all question histories and can share the slice for ID 41514.\n\n6.  Assessment with respect to the user\u2019s specification  \n    Until one of the above retrieval methods is executed, it is impossible to generate the deliverables the user asked for:  \n    \u2022  \u201cRetrieve time-series \u2026 back to 2025-12-15\u201d: not available.  \n    \u2022  \u201cHighlight any jumps over 30 %\u201d: cannot compute.  \n    \u2022  \u201cAttach corresponding comment excerpts\u201d: source comments unavailable.  \n\nIn short, all publicly discoverable evidence\u2014including this latest search\u2014indicates that the requested data are sequestered behind Metaculus\u2019 authenticated API and are not present on the open web. Additional unauthenticated Google searches are therefore unlikely to close the information gap; what is required is direct, credentialed API access or a privately shared data dump.</Agent_report>\n"
