Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / resolution alignment  
Question asks: Is TRMB’s closing price on 2026-02-14 (effectively the last trading close before/at that date—likely 2026-02-13 if markets are closed on the 14th) greater than TRMB’s closing price on 2026-02-07 (pulled from Yahoo Finance)?

2) (a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; facts vs opinions)
- Robinhood TRMB quote page (2026-02-07; market data snapshot)  
  - Facts: intraday price (~$66.67), range, volume vs avg, market cap, P/E, analyst rating summary.  
  - Quality: Medium-high for real-time-ish market data; analyst “% positive” is a coarse aggregation without methodology detail.
- CNN markets TRMB page (undated snapshot but includes current move; mentions close $66.15, after-hours +$0.85)  
  - Facts: last close, after-hours move, basic fundamentals.  
  - Quality: Medium; generally reliable for quote data, but thin on catalysts.
- TradingView analyst summary (aggregated)  
  - Facts: compiled targets/ratings, next-quarter estimates, last EPS surprise.  
  - Opinions: analyst targets/ratings are opinions; not short-horizon calibrated.  
  - Quality: Medium-high as an aggregation, but 12-month targets are weak for a 1-week question.
- Motley Fool (Jan 3, 2026) opinion piece  
  - Facts: business mix, ARR/FCF commentary (partly sourced), peer multiple comparisons.  
  - Opinions: “undervalued by 30%,” market cap scenarios.  
  - Quality: Medium; useful for long-run narrative, weak for next-week direction.
- Barchart (Feb 5, 2026) analyst estimates/ratings aggregation  
  - Facts: performance stats, Q3 results & guidance info, rating distribution, price targets, named bank action (Barclays PT).  
  - Opinions: ratings/targets.  
  - Quality: High for accurately reflecting Street stance; still not a near-term predictor by itself.
- Stock Titan (Dec 5, 2025) buyback authorization  
  - Facts: $1B buyback authorization; structure and no expiration; prior program replaced.  
  - Quality: High for the corporate action факт; near-term impact depends on execution timing (unknown).
- AskNews/Stockpulse “TRMB trades…” (Feb 4–6, 2026) automated market wrap items  
  - Facts: recent percentage moves, volumes, moving averages; mentions institutional block selling as a driver (Feb 5 item).  
  - Quality: Medium. Price/volume likely right; causal attribution (“Swiss bank sold a block”) may be less verifiable and reads like narrative.
- Defense World (Feb 4, 2026) on Rep. McClain Delaney sale + insider selling summary  
  - Facts: reported sale ranges, mentions insider selling totals, buyback reference, institutional holders.  
  - Quality: Medium; transactional facts likely derived from disclosures, but the interpretive weight is usually overstated for tiny trades.
- GuruFocus (Jan 16/20/29; Feb 3) automated “stock down X%” + target vs GF Value  
  - Facts: day move, price levels, analyst target range, “GF Value” model output.  
  - Opinions/models: GF Value is a proprietary valuation estimate; not validated for 1-week horizon.  
  - Quality: Medium; fine for context, weak for timing.
- Benzinga (Dec 16, 2025) analyst upgrade mention  
  - Facts: KeyBanc upgrade to Overweight and PT $99 (as of Dec 2025).  
  - Quality: Medium-high for reporting the action; again, long-horizon.
- Nasdaq/Zacks (Nov 17, 2025) Zacks Rank narrative  
  - Facts: estimates revision direction at that time; Zacks rank.  
  - Quality: Medium; stale for Feb 2026 and still not a 1-week edge.

3) (b) Evidence analysis using the weighing system
Strong evidence
- None that cleanly determines sign over a 1-week window. (Earnings is likely the dominant driver, but we don’t have the actual Feb 10 print/guidance yet—so it’s a known upcoming volatility event rather than directional evidence.)

Moderate evidence (directional, but not decisive)
- Strongly positive Street stance (Barchart/TradingView: “Strong Buy,” high 12-month PT far above spot). This modestly raises odds of “good-enough earnings/guidance” or a relief rally from depressed levels, but it’s not tightly linked to next week’s sign. (+)
- Oversold/negative momentum context: TRMB has fallen sharply since month-end (~-18% to -20% per Stockpulse items; also below 200-day MA). This cuts both ways: mean reversion potential (+) but also “falling knife” risk (–). Net slight (+) in very short horizons when no fresh bad news appears.
- After-hours pop noted by CNN (+$0.85) following a +3.39% day: suggests some near-term bid/relief demand into the window. (+ small)

Weak evidence
- Small political sale (Defense World) and general insider selling: mostly noise at this scale for a 1-week sign forecast. (slight –)
- Buyback authorization: supportive in principle, but timing/pace unknown; weak near-term. (+ small)
- Automated narratives about “Swiss bank block sale” as the cause of a down day: even if true, it’s backward-looking and not necessarily predictive. (neutral)

4) (c) Timeframe analysis
- Time until resolution: ~1 week; effectively ~5 trading sessions from Feb 7 close to the last close before/at Feb 14.  
- If timeframe were halved (~2–3 trading days): less time for any mean reversion; outcome becomes closer to a coin flip driven by very short-term flows—probability would drift closer to ~50%.  
- If timeframe were doubled (~10 trading days): more time for post-catalyst drift/mean reversion; given the depressed price vs longer-run narratives, I’d expect a slightly higher “up” probability than in 1 week (but still far from certain), maybe +1 to +3 pts vs the 1-week forecast.

5) (d) Justification: shifting from the outside view (49%)
Outside view base rate was 49% (near 50/50 due to an earnings-volatility week and mixed signals).

Inside-view adjustments:
- Slight upward pull from (i) strong analyst consensus/targets (not predictive alone, but suggests sentiment/positioning not uniformly bearish), (ii) sharp recent drawdown creating “relief rally / mean reversion” potential, and (iii) some evidence of near-term rebound (CNN after-hours gain; Robinhood intraday near highs).  Net: +2 to +4 points.
- Slight downward pull from persistent negative momentum and reports of large-holder selling/insider selling headlines that can keep a lid on rebounds. Net: -1 to -2 points.

Net adjustment from 49%: about +3 points.

Probability calibration
- Outside view (given): 49% “Yes”.
- Inside view adjustment: +3% (oversold/relief-rally odds modestly outweigh ongoing-downtrend odds).
- Final inside-view forecast: 52% “Yes”.

Checklist:
1. Criteria check: Compare Yahoo Finance close on/for 2026-02-14 (likely last trading close before that date) vs 2026-02-07 close; Yes if later close is higher.  
2. Outside view base rate: 49%.  
3. Consistency: 52 out of 100 times, TRMB’s close at resolution is higher than its 2026-02-07 close.  
4. Key evidence (most important):
   - Sharp recent selloff/price below long MAs → modest mean-reversion odds.
   - Aggregated analyst stance strongly positive (Barchart/TradingView) → modest support for “not-bad” outcomes.
   - Some near-term rebound signs (CNN after-hours; Robinhood near intraday high).  
5. Blind spot: A large negative earnings/guidance shock (or macro risk-off) could drive a decisive drop, overwhelming mean reversion.  
6. Status quo: For a 1-week window, price direction is close to random; stay near 50% with only a small tilt.

Probability: 52%
