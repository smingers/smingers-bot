Analysis:

(a) Source analysis 
1. Robinhood quote page (7 Feb 26) – factual real-time price ($66.67), volume, 52-w range.  Good quality but purely descriptive.  No opinions. 
2. CNN Markets page (7 Feb 26) – factual last close ($66.15), after-hours tick, basic financials.  Reliable quote feed; no forward opinion. 
3. TradingView analyst summary (early Feb 26) – aggregates 12-mo targets ($98) and “Strong Buy” rating.  Opinions from identified sell-side houses; long-horizon, so modest weight. 
4. Motley Fool op-ed (3 Jan 26) – bullish valuation case.  Clear opinion; author is experienced but not a short-term forecaster. 
5. Barchart analyst-estimates article (5 Feb 26) – factual recap of Q3 beat, guidance raise, Barclays $101 target.  Opinions from analysts; medium quality. 
6. StockTitan (5 Dec 25) – board authorised $1 bn buyback.  Factual SEC-level disclosure; structurally supportive. 
7. AskNews flow (3-6 Feb 26) – minute-by-minute quote reports: TRMB slid to $63-64 on 4 Feb, bounced to $64–66 by 6 Feb.  Machine-generated, factual. 
8. DefenseWorld (4 Feb 26) – congresswoman sale; insider-sale compilation.  Factual filings, but motive/impact speculative. 
9. GuruFocus cluster (16 Jan–3 Feb 26) – automated alerts on price drops and analyst PTs.  Data accurate; narrative auto-generated. 
All other snippets concern unrelated tickers – ignored.

(b) Evidence analysis 
Strong evidence (direction-neutral, variance-raising) 
• Earnings report scheduled 10 Feb 26 (4th-qtr FY 25).  Earnings events historically move TRMB ±5-8 % in a day; last three out of four were positive surprises (+2 ½ % same-day pop last quarter). 

Moderate evidence (slight upward tilt) 
• $1 bn open-ended buyback (5 Dec 25) still unused; creates structural bid. 
• Stock is –20 % YTD and –13 % vs. 52-wk, trading far below 200-DMA; mean-reversion tendency after sharp sell-offs one month pre-earnings. 
• Analyst consensus overwhelmingly “Buy”; 12-mo targets imply ~45 % upside.  While long-horizon, they signal broadly positive expectations for the report. 

Moderate negative evidence 
• Insider and small political sales in January-February; not large dollar size but lean negative. 
• P/E 43 > peer median; any earnings miss could punish price sharply. 

Weak evidence 
• Retail-oriented bullish op-eds (Motley Fool). 
• Slight uptick in short interest back in Sep 25 (dated). 

Net evidence weight: small upward tilt, large increase in variance.

(c) Timeframe analysis 
Prediction horizon = 5 trading days (Mon 9 Feb – Fri 13 Feb).  If horizon were halved (to 2-3 days, pre-earnings) I would drop probability to 51 % (drift only).  If doubled to two weeks I would nudge to 55 % (more time for post-earnings drift and buyback execution).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment 
Outside-view base rate for a single S&P 500 constituent finishing a week higher than it started ≈ 53 %.  Adjustments:
+1 %  Oversold bounce potential (recent –17 % YTD, mean-reversion). 
+1 %  Ongoing $1 bn buy-back provides asymmetric support. 
–1 %  Elevated valuation + risk of earnings disappointment. 
Net shift: +1 %.  Outside-view 53 % → inside-view 54 %.

Probability calibration

I expect that in roughly 54 out of 100 comparable weeks TRMB’s close on Fri 13 Feb 26 will exceed the Fri 6 Feb 26 close.  Given ±7 % one-week historical volatility, a ±10 % change in assigned probability would require clear guidance leaks or a broad market shock, neither presently evident.

Checklist:
1. Event: “Will TRMB close higher on 14 Feb 26 than on 7 Feb 26?” (effectively Fri-to-Fri).  ✔
2. Outside base 53 %; inside view anchored. ✔
3. “54 out of 100 times, price ends higher.” ✔
4. Key evidence: (i) earnings catalyst, (ii) $1 bn buyback, (iii) recent sharp sell-off, (iv) positive surprise history, (v) high P/E risk. ✔
5. Blind-spot: major market sell-off or earnings miss causing >8 % drop; would swing probability well below 50 %. 
6. Status-quo: drift slightly up; I remain close to coin-flip, mild bias up. ✔

Probability: 54%
