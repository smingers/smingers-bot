Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. MarketBeat “Trimble Expected to Announce Earnings …” (Jan 31). Well-known market-data site.  Factual items: last close ($67.88), scheduled earnings date (10 Feb 2026), analyst consensus, insider sales, buy-back authorization.  Contains opinions (“Moderate Buy”) that come from identifiable analysts; those are expert opinions but still forward-looking.  
2. Simply Wall St historical performance page. Automated data feed from S&P Global.  Purely historical ratios and growth rates; minimal opinion (“high-quality earnings”).  
3. Yahoo Finance/Zacks preview (3 Feb). Established quantitative service.  Facts: consensus EPS $0.96, revenue estimate $950 M.  Opinion: the Zacks ESP model explanation is generic.  
4. Barchart/FinancialContent analyst aggregate (5 Feb). Facts: price targets, consensus rating statistics.  Opinions are aggregated from analysts.  
5. Motley Fool articles (1 Feb & 3 Jan). Retail-oriented site; heavy opinion (“under-appreciated AI powerhouse”, “could be worth $25 B”).  Factual nuggets: ARR mix, insider/institutional purchases.  Opinion weight discounted.  
6. Agent report. Assembles (i) price history availability, (ii) schedule of earnings on 10 Feb, (iii) news flow scarcity.  High factual quality; points out that five-day-return statistics still need calculation.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• TRMB’s own history of five-trading-day returns since 2014 (≈3 000 observations).  
• All S&P 500 constituents’ five-day returns (tens of thousands of observations).  
• Broad-market “weekly” close-to-close behaviour (e.g., S&P 500 since 1950).  

Suitability: the question is about one specific share over exactly five trading days.  TRMB’s own distribution is therefore the tightest and avoids cross-company differences in beta, sector shocks, etc.  I select “TRMB five-trading-day returns since 2014” as the primary reference class.

A quick back-of-the-envelope: in U.S. equities the probability that a random five-trading-day return is positive is roughly 54-57%.  TRMB’s beta is 1.6 (MarketBeat) which increases volatility but not the sign balance; companies of similar beta usually cluster around 52-55% positive weeks.  Without having the spreadsheet result, I adopt 53% as the best point estimate for TRMB’s historical positive-five-day frequency.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Baseline date: Fri 7 Feb 2026.  Outcome date: Fri 14 Feb 2026.  Trading days in between: 10th-14th Feb (five sessions).  So we are forecasting a five-trading-day move.  In TRMB’s 12-year history, nothing unusual happens in most such intervals; the base-rate odds of a gain ≈ 53%.  Weekly volatility (σ of 5-day returns) for mid-cap tech-industrial names with β≈1.6 runs ≈ 8-9%; the expected price change is therefore small relative to that σ, justifying a probability modestly above 50/50.

(d) Justification  
• Base rate from reference class: 53%.  
• We deliberately hold off on any “inside-view” adjustment (e.g., the 10 Feb earnings catalyst) because this exercise is to create an outside-view baseline.  
• No dividend or split in the window, so status-quo drift is the sole driver.  
• Market as a whole shows no strong seasonal bias in mid-February.

Hence the outside-view (base-rate) probability that TRMB’s close on 14 Feb 2026 exceeds that of 7 Feb 2026 is about 53%.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: TRMB five-day historical positive frequency ≈ 53%.  
Cross-check: generic S&P500 weekly positive rate ≈ 56% → within a few points.  
Given the unavoidable ±2 pp estimation error from not yet running the exact computation, I round to the nearest percent: 53%.

Outside View Prediction:
Probability TRMB closes higher on 14 Feb 2026 than on 7 Feb 2026: 53 %
