# Article Summary: "This Industrial Stock Could Be Worth $25 Billion"

**Source:** The Motley Fool  
**Date:** January 03, 2026  
**Author:** Lee Samaha

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Current Business Composition:** Software, services, and recurring revenue now account for almost 80% of Trimble's revenue
- **Stock Performance:** TRMB was up 3.50% (as of article publication)
- **Current Valuation:** The article suggests Trimble is undervalued by as much as 30%

  - 2025: Adjusted figure of approximately $750 million (adjusted to exclude a $277 million one-time cash tax payment relating to asset sale)

<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve TRMB daily closing prices 2014-02-07 to 2026-02-06, compute probability of positive five-trading-day return, mean and stdev; list any scheduled TRMB events (earnings, ex-dividend, conference) between 2026-02-07 and 2026-02-14; summarize key Trimble news items from 1 Jan 2026-6 Feb 2026.
The request has three distinct parts.  The material now located in the search results lets us finish two of them (scheduled events and news summary) but still leaves one quantitative step unfinished (the five-day-return statistics).  Details are below.

A.  Five-trading-day-return statistics  
•  Data coverage.  Two free sites – StockAnalysis and Macrotrends – each offer a one-click CSV download of Trimble’s complete split-adjusted daily close series, including the most-recent session of 6 Feb 2026 (close = 66.15 USD) and every session back well before 7 Feb 2014 (StockAnalysis “Trimble Stock Price History”, Google result; Macrotrends page, Google result).  That span supplies all 3 030 calendar dates and roughly 3 025 overlapping five-day windows needed for the calculation requested.

•  What has not yet been produced.  No publicly available page lists:
  – the rolling five-day return R5(t) = Close(t)/Close(t-5) − 1 for the entire 14-year window;  
  – the proportion of those R5 values that are > 0;  
  – the mean and sample standard deviation of all R5 values.  

  Those figures must therefore be computed locally (e.g., in Python/pandas or a spreadsheet) after downloading one of the CSVs or by pulling the same dates through the yfinance API.  Until that mechanical step is executed, the numerical answer remains an information gap.

B.  Scheduled Trimble events during 7 Feb 2026 – 14 Feb 2026  
•  Earnings release & webcast: Trimble will announce its Q4 2025 and full-year 2025 results on Tuesday, 10 February 2026 at 08:00 a.m. ET and host the corresponding conference call and webcast the same morning (Yahoo Finance press release dated 27 Jan 2026 and TradingView earnings calendar, Google result).  
•  Dividend/ex-dividend: Trimble does not pay a dividend; Macrotrends shows no dividend history and Yahoo Finance lists “Dividend = N/A”, so no ex-dividend date exists in the week.  
•  Industry or investor conferences: The Trimble Investor Relations “Events & Presentations” calendar is blank for that week, and the next major user event (Insight 2026) is not until September (Insight.trimble.com, Google result).  
Conclusion: the only scheduled corporate event in the requested window is the Q4/FY-25 earnings release and webcast on 10 Feb 2026.

C.  Key Trimble news items between 1 Jan 2026 and 6 Feb 2026  
The news flow specific to Trimble Inc. is limited; the items below are the only company-related stories retrieved in the period.

1. 27 Jan 2026 – “Trimble to Report Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2025 Financial Results on February 10, 2026” (corporate press release carried by Yahoo Finance and multiple wire services).  Announces the timing of the earnings release and webcast.  
2. 5 Jan 2026 – Yahoo Finance feature “Analysts give Trimble a Strong-Buy rating, average price target $96.09”, recapping sell-side sentiment after the Q3 call.  
3. Insider-trading Form 4 filings reported by Finviz (Google result):  
   • 15 Jan 2026 – CFO Phillip Sawarynski exercised 7 085 options at $79.76 and retained the shares.  
   • 13 Jan 2026 – CEO Robert G. Painter sold 7 500 shares at $80.88.  
   These filings generated brief automated wire notes (e.g., MarketBeat).  
4. Throughout January several automated reminders (MarketBeat, Longbridge, SahmCapital) reiterated the 10 Feb earnings date but introduced no new corporate information.

No press releases were found on acquisitions, divestitures, major contract wins, product launches or regulatory matters during 1 Jan – 6 Feb 2026.  The remaining articles returned by Google News that contain the word “Trimble” refer either to a photographer’s by-line (Syracuse.com piece of 23 Jan 2026) or to high-school sports teams named “Trimble Tech”, none of which relate to Trimble Inc. operations (Google News results).

Remaining information gap  
The single outstanding requirement is the actual computation of the five-trading-day-return probability, mean and standard deviation.  All raw prices needed are freely downloadable (see Part A), but the arithmetic still must be run in a local tool.  Once those three statistics are calculated, every element of the original query will be fully answered.

No further web searching is likely to provide those pre-calculated statistics; performing the calculation is the only path to completion.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.

Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and data.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occuring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
