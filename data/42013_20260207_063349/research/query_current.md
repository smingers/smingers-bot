Analysis:
To judge whether Trimble Inc. (TRMB) is more likely to close higher on 2026-02-14 than on 2026-02-07, I need very recent information that could materially shift the share price over the coming week.  Key items:
• Any Q4-2025 earnings release or preliminary results (Trimble’s fiscal year ends in December; the earnings date is often early February).  
• Management guidance for 2026 or commentary given in an investor presentation, conference call, or SEC filing.  
• Fresh analyst upgrades/downgrades or target-price changes issued after earnings.  
• Sector-wide news that could move geospatial, construction-technology or transportation-logistics software names.  
• Macro events (rates, infrastructure spending bills, semiconductor supply) that might especially impact Trimble.  

Very recent articles (from late January 2026 through today, 7 Feb 2026) are therefore most relevant, particularly those covering an earnings announcement, guidance changes, large contract wins, M&A rumors, or activist activity.  My searches will target these topics.
