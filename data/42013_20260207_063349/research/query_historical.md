Analysis:
To gauge whether TRMB will rise over the coming week I first want a base-rate view: how often Trimble’s share price finishes a week higher than the previous week and what the typical one-week return/volatility look like. Next I need to know if any firm-specific catalysts (earnings release, guidance, M&A, ex-dividend, product announcements) are scheduled between 7 Feb 2026 and 14 Feb 2026, because these can skew the distribution. Finally, I should scan the most recent news flow for material developments that could move the stock. The queries below are designed to collect (1) the date of the next earnings release, (2) very recent news headlines, and (3) historical price data plus a calculation of weekly-return statistics and a brief event/news summary.
