Wall Street analysts project a mean price target of $98.11, implying a 26.5% upside potential, based on nine short-term estimates with a standard deviation of $2.76\u2014indicating relatively high consensus. The lowest target is $93.00 (19.9% upside), and the most optimistic is $102.00 (31.5% upside). While price targets are often criticized for being overly optimistic due to business incentives and lack of predictive accuracy, the clustering of estimates suggests analyst agreement. More substantively, earnings estimate revisions are positive: the Zacks Consensus Estimate for the current year has risen 5.2% over the past month, with six upward revisions and no downward ones. TRMB holds a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy), placing it in the top 5% of over 4,000 ranked stocks based on earnings momentum. This rank, backed by empirical research, is a more reliable indicator of near-term upside than price targets alone. Despite skepticism toward analyst price targets, the convergence of strong earnings revisions and a top-tier Zacks Rank supports the view that TRMB may have significant upside potential.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 02:55 PM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/does-trimble-trmb-have-potential-rally-265-wall-street-analysts-expect)\n\n**Price Over Earnings Overview: Trimble**\nTrimble Inc. (NASDAQ: TRMB) closed the current market session at $78.72, reflecting a 0.87% increase. Over the past month, the stock declined by 1.16%, but it rose 28.15% over the past year. The company's price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is lower than the industry average of 73.27 for the Electronic Equipment, Instruments & Components sector. A lower P/E may indicate either that investors expect limited future growth or that the stock is undervalued relative to its peers. However, the P/E ratio alone is insufficient for investment decisions; it should be used alongside other financial metrics and qualitative analysis, as factors such as industry trends and business cycles also influence stock performance. According to Benzinga News, the P/E ratio is a useful but limited tool for assessing market performance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 09:05 PM\nSource:[Benzinga News](https://www.benzinga.com/insights/news/25/10/48239241/price-over-earnings-overview-trimble)\n\n**TRMB\u2019s short interest surges to 6.34 million shares \u2013 Knox Daily**\nTrimble Inc.
