Billionaire Israel Englander's Millennium Management hedge fund acquired more than 250,000 shares (according to most recent 13F filing)\n\n## Company Context:\n\n- Trimble originally started as a hardware company providing geospatial positioning tools for construction\n- The company has transitioned to software as its primary business\n- Trimble's geospatial positioning and site mapping software is now critical in high-tech sectors including:\n  - Autonomous vehicles\n  - Defense\n  - Robotics\n\n## Opinion (from article author):\n\nThe author characterizes TRMB as an \"underappreciated AI powerhouse\" and a \"hidden gem\" in the AI sector, suggesting it presents \"an excellent opportunity\" to buy the recent dip.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/03/this-industrial-stock-could-be-worth-25-billion/\">\n# Article Summary: \"This Industrial Stock Could Be Worth $25 Billion\"\n\n**Source:** The Motley Fool  \n**Date:** January 03, 2026  \n**Author:** Lee Samaha\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- **Current Business Composition:** Software, services, and recurring revenue now account for almost 80% of Trimble's revenue\n- **Stock Performance:** TRMB was up 3.50% (as of article publication)\n- **Current Valuation:** The article suggests Trimble is undervalued by as much as 30%\n\n## Financial Projections:\n\n- **Annualized Recurring Revenue (ARR):** Management expects ARR to grow at a low double-digit to mid-teens annual rate through 2027\n- **Free Cash Flow (FCF) Projections:**\n  - 2025: Adjusted figure of approximately $750 million (adjusted to exclude a $277 million one-time cash tax payment relating to asset sale)\n  - 2027: Wall Street analyst consensus projects $1 billion\n  - This represents a 15% annual growth rate\n\n## Valuation Metrics:\n\n- **Current FCF Multiple:** Trimble trades at 25.3 times FCF in 2025 (based on adjusted FCF)\n- **Peer Comparison:** The article notes Trimble trades at the low end compared to peers like Bentley Systems (BSY) and Autodesk (ADSK)\n- **Valuation Scenarios:**\n  -

The material now located in the search results lets us finish two of them (scheduled events and news summary) but still leaves one quantitative step unfinished (the five-day-return statistics).  Details are below.\n\nA.  Five-trading-day-return statistics  \n\u2022  Data coverage.  Two free sites \u2013 StockAnalysis and Macrotrends \u2013 each offer a one-click CSV download of Trimble\u2019s complete split-adjusted daily close series, including the most-recent session of 6 Feb 2026 (close = 66.15 USD) and every session back well before 7 Feb 2014 (StockAnalysis \u201cTrimble Stock Price History\u201d, Google result; Macrotrends page, Google result).  That span supplies all 3 030 calendar dates and roughly 3 025 overlapping five-day windows needed for the calculation requested.\n\n\u2022  What has not yet been produced.  No publicly available page lists:\n  \u2013 the rolling five-day return R5(t) = Close(t)/Close(t-5) \u2212 1 for the entire 14-year window;  \n  \u2013 the proportion of those R5 values that are > 0;  \n  \u2013 the mean and sample standard deviation of all R5 values.  \n\n  Those figures must therefore be computed locally (e.g., in Python/pandas or a spreadsheet) after downloading one of the CSVs or by pulling the same dates through the yfinance API.  Until that mechanical step is executed, the numerical answer remains an information gap.\n\nB.  Scheduled Trimble events during 7 Feb 2026 \u2013 14 Feb 2026  \n\u2022  Earnings release & webcast: Trimble will announce its Q4 2025 and full-year 2025 results on Tuesday, 10 February 2026 at 08:00 a.m. ET and host the corresponding conference call and webcast the same morning (Yahoo Finance press release dated 27 Jan 2026 and TradingView earnings calendar, Google result).  \n\u2022  Dividend/ex-dividend: Trimble does not pay a dividend; Macrotrends shows no dividend history and Yahoo Finance lists \u201cDividend = N/A\u201d, so no ex-dividend date exists in the week.  \n\u2022  Industry or investor conferences: The Trimble Investor Relations \u201cEvents & Presentations\u201d calendar is blank for that week, and the next major user event (Insight 2026) is not until September (Insight.trimble.com, Google result).  \nConclusion: the only scheduled corporate event in the requested window is the Q4/FY-25 earnings release and webcast on 10 Feb 2026.\n\nC.  Key Trimble news items between 1 Jan 2026 and 6 Feb 2026  \nThe news flow specific to Trimble Inc. is limited; the items below are the only company-related stories retrieved in the period.\n\n1. 27 Jan 2026 \u2013 \u201cTrimble to Report Fourth Quarter and Full Year 2025 Financial Results on February 10, 2026\u201d (corporate press release carried by Yahoo Finance and multiple wire services).  Announces the timing of the earnings release and webcast.  \n2. 5 Jan 2026 \u2013 Yahoo Finance feature \u201cAnalysts give Trimble a Strong-Buy rating, average price target $96.09\u201d, recapping sell-side sentiment after the Q3 call.  \n3. Insider-trading Form 4 filings reported by Finviz (Google result):  \n   \u2022 15 Jan 2026 \u2013 CFO Phillip Sawarynski exercised 7 085 options at $79.76 and retained the shares.  \n   \u2022 13 Jan 2026 \u2013 CEO Robert G. Painter sold 7 500 shares at $80.88.  \n   These filings generated brief automated wire notes (e.g., MarketBeat).  \n4. Throughout January several automated reminders (MarketBeat, Longbridge, SahmCapital) reiterated the 10 Feb earnings date but introduced no new corporate information.\n\nNo press releases were found on acquisitions, divestitures, major contract wins, product launches or regulatory matters during 1 Jan \u2013 6 Feb 2026.  The remaining articles returned by Google News that contain the word \u201cTrimble\u201d refer either to a photographer\u2019s by-line (Syracuse.com piece of 23 Jan 2026) or to high-school sports teams named \u201cTrimble Tech\u201d, none of which relate to Trimble Inc. operations (Google News results).\n\nRemaining information gap  \nThe single outstanding requirement is the actual computation of the five-trading-day-return probability, mean and standard deviation.  All raw prices needed are freely downloadable (see Part A), but the arithmetic still must be run in a local tool.  Once those three statistics are calculated, every element of the original query will be fully answered.\n\nNo further web searching is likely to provide those pre-calculated statistics; performing the calculation is the only path to completion.</Agent_report>\n"
