Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, newest first)

1. Metaculus target question page (implicit in the prompt, dated 2026-02-01).  
   – Factual: Community prediction (CP) = 82 %. Direct, authoritative.  
   – Quality: Primary source. No opinion.

2. Asknews article set (all dated 2026-02-07 ± 2 days).  
   – All cricket/football/darts pieces, unrelated to Nathan Young or the Cup. Contain no data that can move the CP.  
   – Quality: Recognisable news outlets; irrelevant to resolution.

3. “Agent report” (inside outside-view block).  
   – Factual: There is no public time-series for Q41508; Metaculus API needs auth.  
   – Opinion: The data exist but are not open.  
   – Quality: Plausible but secondary.

Bottom line: We have a single high-quality datum (CP = 82 % on 1 Feb) and no fresh news capable of altering it; all other articles are noise.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighed)

Strong evidence
• Current CP = 82 % exactly; threshold is “> 82 %”. (structural, primary)

Moderate evidence
• 7-day movements of high-probability Metaculus binaries are typically ≤ ±3 pp, often zero. (historical platform behaviour)  
• In previous Cups (2024-25), “Community vs. benchmark” questions opened high (≈80 – 85 %) and tended to drift slightly downward during the first fortnight as Nathan Young posts his first forecasts. (analogous history)

Weak evidence
• Possible upcoming publicity spikes once the Cup leaderboard is published (speculative).  
• Unknown sequencing of Nathan’s first bulk edits (could push CP either way).

Net pull: moderate-to-strong tilt towards “No”.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time to resolution: 7.3 days. If the horizon were halved (≈3.5 days) I would drop the Yes-probability ~3 pp (less time to move); if doubled (≈15 days) I would raise it ~6 pp (more opportunity for an uptick).

(d) Justification of inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (sticky-forecast heuristic): 39 % (see prompt).  
Adjustments:

-1 pp  Strict “>” inequality and rounding—exact 82 % counts as No.  
-2 pp  Historical slight downward drift after opening optimism.  
0 pp   No meaningful Cup news released since 1 Feb (neutral).  
Total shift: -3 pp ⇒ 36 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that in 36 out of 100 comparable weeks the displayed community prediction for Q41508 ends up strictly above 82 %; in the other 64 it is 82 % or lower.

Checklist:
1. Restated: On 14 Feb 2026 16:20 UTC, is CP(Q41508) > 82 %?  
2. Base rate = 39 %. Final = 36 %; roots intact.  
3. “36 out of 100 times, CP finishes above 82 %.” ✔  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Current CP exactly at threshold.  
   • Metaculus short-term stickiness.  
   • Down-drift in previous Cups’ early weeks.  
   • Strict inequality penalises status-quo.  
5. Blind-spot: A Nathan blunder (-20 pp leaderboard hit) widely publicised in next few days could spike CP to 85 %+.  
6. Status-quo bias acknowledged; timeframe short, volatility low.

Probability: 36%
