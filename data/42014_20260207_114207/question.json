    "description": "Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41508\n- Original question title: Will the Community beat Nathan Young in the Metaculus Cup Spring 2026?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-01: 82.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> This question will resolve as **Yes** if, at the conclusion of the Metaculus Cup Spring 2026, the Community Prediction has a greater Total Score than Nathan Young in the tournament leaderboard.\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> This question will resolve only after all other Metaculus Cup Spring 2026 questions have resolved and will not be included in the scoring used to determine whether the Community Prediction outperformed Nathan Young.\n\nOriginal background: \n> The Metaculus Cup Spring 2026 launched with a base prize pool of \\$5,000. According to the [tournament announcement](https://www.metaculus.com/notebooks/41477/spring-2026-cup-announcement/), an additional \\$2,500 will be added to the prize pool if the Community Prediction outperforms Nathan Young, a designated benchmark forecaster, over the course of the tournament.\n> \n> Specifically, the announcement states that:\n> \n> > \u201cNew this season: the Community Prediction will go head-to-head against Nathan Young\u2026 Beat Nathan and an additional \\$2,500 gets added to the forecasting prize pool.\u201d\n> \n> The same announcement also describes Nathan as follows:\n> \n> > Nathan is the Director of [Goodheart Labs](https://goodheartlabs.com/), where he builds epistemic tools including the world's first AI-written community note on X. He works as a geopolitical forecaster with the Swift Centre, covering topics from elections to healthcare innovation. He previously served as Head of Forecasting at Zeitgeist, a crypto prediction market integrating futarchy governance, and has moderated for both Metaculus and Manifold Markets.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41508,\"question_id\":41255,\"last_cp\":0.82}}`",
