Analysis:
The target is the Metaculus community-wide probability that the Community Prediction will beat Nathan Young in the Spring 2026 Cup. On 1 Feb 2026 the crowd sat exactly at 82 %. To judge whether it will tick above 82 % by 14 Feb we want near-term signals that could shift sentiment:

1. Tournament leaderboard updates since 1 Feb, especially any new batch of question resolutions that change Nathan Young’s relative score versus the Community.
2. Blog posts or Metaculus forum discussions interpreting those updates.
3. Public commentary by Nathan Young (e.g., on X/Twitter or Goodheart Labs blog) that might influence forecasters’ expectations of his future performance.
4. Announcements from Metaculus staff about methodology tweaks or prize-pool incentives that could encourage more aggressive community forecasting.
5. Any data on current forecasting accuracy comparisons in similar past cups (for base-rate adjustment).

Recent news articles or posts covering the above will help estimate whether most forecasters are likely to nudge the probability upward (perhaps because Nathan is currently trailing) or downward (if he is catching up).
