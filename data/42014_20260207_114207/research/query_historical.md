Analysis:
The key to judging whether the community prediction will be above 82 % on 2026-02-14 is understanding how these tournament-style “Community vs Benchmark” questions have behaved in the past.  Useful context includes:  
• How often (and by how much) the community prediction has moved during the final week of earlier Metaculus Cup seasons.  
• Whether the community generally outperforms (or under-performs) a named benchmark such as Nathan Young in previous tournaments (Autumn 2025, Spring 2025, Autumn 2024, etc.).  
• Any publicly available leaderboard snapshots or blog posts that mention Nathan Young’s track record relative to the community.  
• Recent discussion threads that might signal new information affecting either Nathan’s or the community’s score and thereby shift the probability in the last week.

To surface this background I want:
1. A standard Google search aimed at finding historical Metaculus Cup pages, archived leaderboards, or notebooks comparing community vs Nathan Young.  
2. A Google News search for recent coverage, interviews, or press releases that might hint at changes in Nathan Young’s participation or forecasting volume (which could sway sentiment).  
3. An “agent” query instructing the crawler to pull the full time-series of community predictions for question #41508 and for analogous questions in previous seasons, plus any official statements about rule changes that would alter scoring dynamics.

Search queries:
1. Metaculus Cup community vs Nathan Young (Google)
2. Nathan Young Metaculus Cup interview (Google News)
3. Provide historical time-series of community prediction for Metaculus question 41508 and past Cup seasons; include any Metaculus notebooks comparing community performance to Nathan Young. (Agent)
