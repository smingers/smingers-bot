Gemini highlights the 'IPL factor,' noting that players like Shimron Hetmyer and Jason Holder have extensive experience playing in Kolkata, which gives them an edge on a pitch expected to slow down in the afternoon. The AI also emphasizes West Indies\u2019 batting depth, with Shai Hope anchoring the innings and power hitters in the middle and lower order, projecting a score range of 175\u2013190. Spinners Gudakesh Motie and Akeal Hosein are expected to play a key role as the pitch deteriorates. ChatGPT confirms West Indies\u2019 superior T20 firepower and tournament experience, particularly on Indian conditions, as decisive factors. However, both models acknowledge Scotland\u2019s potential to disrupt the game: they hold a 1\u20130 head-to-head advantage from their 2022 World Cup upset, and opener George Munsey is close to becoming Scotland\u2019s leading T20I run-scorer. A 3:00 PM start may encourage batting first, and early wickets or a strong top-order performance could tighten the contest. Despite the odds favoring West Indies, Scotland\u2019s freedom from pressure and past success make them a challenging opponent, especially if the Windies falter early. The prediction is based on AI analysis of team form, historical data, and recent performances, and is not a guarantee of the match outcome.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2026 05:30 AM\nSource:[The Financial Express](https://www.financialexpress.com/sports/cricket/west-indies-vs-scotland-t20-world-cup-2026-prediction-ai-doesnt-rule-out-a-scottish-surprise/4134405/)\n\n**'India's going to be hard to beat': Men in Blue backed to successfully defend T20 World Cup by Australian pace legends**\nThe Indian men's cricket team, led by Suryakumar Yadav, is widely regarded as the favourite to win the 2026 ICC T20 World Cup, having been the most dominant team in the format since their 2024 victory. They are co-hosts of the tournament alongside Sri Lanka and enter as defending champions. Under Yadav\u2019s leadership since July 2024, India has won 33 of 41 matches, including a clean sweep in the Asia Cup and a 4-1 series win over New Zealand. A major boost came from Pakistan\u2019s boycott of their Group A match in Colombo on 15 February 2026, resulting in a walkover for India. Australian pace legends Glenn McGrath, Damien Fleming, and Jason Gillespie, speaking on The Fast Bowling Cartel podcast, all named India as a top contender. McGrath stated, 'India's going to be hard to beat,' while Gillespie predicted India, South Africa, England, and Sri Lanka in the semi-finals, with South Africa as the eventual winner. Fleming picked India, South Africa, England, and Australia, though he expressed uncertainty. The tournament begins on 7 February 2026, with matches including India vs. USA and Pakistan vs. Netherlands.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 07, 2026 01:41 AM\nSource:[Firstpost](https://www.firstpost.com/firstcricket/india-t20-world-cup-2026-prediction-mcgrath-gillespie-fleming-13977147.html)\n\n**Nasser Hussain's T20 World Cup predictions: Winners, surprise packages, players to watch and how will England do?**\nOn the Sky Sports Cricket Podcast, former England captain Nasser Hussain made predictions for the 2026 Men's T20 World Cup, which ran from February 7 to March 8 and was broadcast live on Sky Sports. Hussain named India as his top pick, citing their status as defending champions, home advantage, strong six-hitting ability, and bowling depth. He predicted India would be joined in the semi-finals by England, South Africa, and Afghanistan. Afghanistan, under coach Jonathan Trott\u2019s final tournament, were praised for their high-quality hitters, balanced bowling with seam, swing, and spin options, and experience from franchise leagues. Other teams in contention included Australia, Pakistan, Sri Lanka, West Indies, Nepal, Netherlands, and Scotland. Hussain highlighted Nepal\u2019s passionate fan base and growing support, noting their potential to advance if they beat Scotland and Italy. He praised England\u2019s strong batting lineup with Phil Salt and Jos Buttler opening, Harry Brook in the middle order, and Tom Banton\u2019s development, while noting concerns over new-ball selection. Sam Curran\u2019s return and Adil Rashid\u2019s reliability were seen as positives. For individual awards, Hussain predicted Abhishek Sharma (India) as the leading run-scorer due to his form and power-hitting, and Jasprit Bumrah (India) as the top wicket-taker for his death-over effectiveness. He also noted Quinton de Kock\u2019s return to form for South Africa and Pakistan captain Salman Ali Agha\u2019s strong performance at No. 3, supported by coach Mike Hesson\u2019s calming influence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 05:27 PM\nSource:[SkySports](https://www.skysports.com/cricket/news/12080/13504168/nasser-hussains-t20-world-cup-predictions-winners-surprise-packages-players-to-watch-and-how-will-england-do)\n\n**Preview of Round 22 of the Eredivisie: PSV's Title Lead, Key Matchups, and Predictions**\nThe 22nd round of the Eredivisie features several key matchups with implications for standings and team form. PSV has extended their lead to 17 points, making the title nearly certain, while the battle for European spots intensifies. N.E.C. remains the most attacking team in the league, with the highest goal tally after PSV, and is predicted to score in both halves against Heracles, who are recovering from a losing streak. In a match between Vitesse and VVV-Venlo, Vitesse's strong home form and VVV's poor away record, including eight consecutive losses, suggest a strong first-half performance by Vitesse, with a clean sheet in the first half expected. In a low-scoring clash between Twente and Herenven, both teams have poor finishing records but strong defenses, leading to a prediction of more goals in the second half due to fatigue and defensive errors. Fortuna Sittard faces Sparta Rotterdam, who are in excellent form, and despite Fortuna's poor defensive record, they are expected to score at least one goal. In a match between Utrecht and Feyenoord, both teams have weak defenses and strong attacks, leading to a prediction of both teams scoring with a total over 2.5 goals. In the central fixture of the round, Ajax and AZ face off in a North Holland derby, with AZ having won the last 10 meetings, including a 6-0 victory. Despite Ajax's desire to recover, AZ's defensive focus and recent form suggest a tight game with both teams scoring but fewer than 4.5 total goals. In Deventer, Go Ahead Eagles, motivated by a recent cup defeat, are expected to beat Telstar, who are winless in 15 games. In the final match, PSV are heavily favored to beat Groningen, who are without key defenders due to yellow card accumulation and in poor form. PSV is predicted to win, potentially securing the title as early as April 4, 2026, if they win all remaining games. All predictions are based on team form, injuries, and historical trends, with disclaimers that outcomes are uncertain and bets should be placed responsibly.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 03:28 PM\nSource:[Sports.ru](https://www.sports.ru/football/blogs/3382680.html)\n\n**India vs USA T20 World Cup 2026: Check predicted XI, weather, pitch report and more**\nIndia will begin its T20 World Cup 2026 title defense against the USA on February 7, 2026, at Wankhede Stadium in Mumbai.

India's batting lineup features Abhishek Sharma, Tilak Varma, Rinku Singh, and finishers Shivam Dube. The Wankhede pitch is expected to favor batsmen, being flat with good bounce and carry, as demonstrated in the last men's T20I on February 2, 2025, where India defeated England by 150 runs. Weather on match day is forecast to be clear with a temperature of 32\u00b0C, wind speed of 13 km/h, and zero probability of precipitation or thunderstorms.

Multiple experts from the Test Match Special (TMS) team predict India as the favorite to win, citing home advantage, strong form, and familiarity with local conditions. Former England bowlers Steven Finn, Alex Hartley, Tymal Mills, and Daniel Norcross all favor India, with Hartley noting no team has ever won a men's T20 World Cup on home soil. BBC\u2019s Henry Moeran acknowledges India\u2019s confidence but warns of potential home pressure and widespread IPL experience among global players. Others like Prakash Wakankar highlight South Africa\u2019s recent Test Championship win and Australia\u2019s potential, while Aatif Nawaz and Matthew Henry emphasize India\u2019s dominance despite concerns over injuries like Josh Hazlewood\u2019s absence. For leading run-scorer, Abhishek Sharma is the top pick across multiple analysts due to his explosive strike rate, home conditions, and debut tournament opportunity, with Travis Head, Aiden Markram, and Suryakumar Yadav also mentioned. Key batters to watch include Dewald Brevis, Finn Allen, Tom Banton, and Wayne Madsen (a long shot). For leading wicket-taker, Jasprit Bumrah is heavily favored for his death-over mastery and past final performance, followed by Kuldeep Yadav, Nathan Ellis, and Abrar Ahmed. Notable bowlers to watch include Usman Tariq (Pakistan), Azmatullah Omarzai (Afghanistan), Noor Ahmad (Afghanistan), Anrich Nortje (South Africa), Chakravarthy, and Saim Ayub (Pakistan), with Keshav Maharaj highlighted for his form and experience.

He identified England, New Zealand, South Africa, and India as the likely semifinalists, citing England's strong recent form, including a 3-0 series sweep over Sri Lanka. Gavaskar emphasized India's superiority in preparation, contrasting it with Australia\u2019s lack of focus post-Ashes, and noted that India has won eight consecutive T20I series since their 2024 World Cup victory, including series wins against Australia (2-1), South Africa (3-1), and New Zealand (4-1). India also defeated South Africa by 30 runs in a warm-up match. The tournament begins on February 7, 2026, with India facing the USA in Mumbai. Gavaskar stated, 'In my opinion, these teams will be the semifinalists - India, New Zealand, England, and South Africa.

The 15-member squad, announced on January 30, 2026, includes key players such as Monank Patel (captain), Saurabh Netravalkar, Andries Gous, Harmeet Singh, and Saiteja Mukkamalla, who is ranked 25th in the world among batters. The probable playing XI, based on training camps and warm-up matches, features Andries Gous (wicketkeeper), Monank Patel (captain), Shehan Jayasuriya, Milind Kumar, Shayan Jahangir, Shubham Ranjane, Harmeet Singh, Shadley Van Schalkwyk, Jessy Singh, Saurabh Netravalkar, and Ali Khan. The USA\u2019s group fixtures are: February 7 vs India (Mumbai), February 10 vs Pakistan (Colombo), February 13 vs Netherlands (Chennai), and February 15 vs Namibia (Chennai). While the team is expected to challenge the Netherlands and Namibia for third place, qualifying for the Super 8s over top-tier teams like India or Pakistan would require a major upset, given the favorable conditions for those sides. The USA\u2019s 2024 success, including winning the North America T20 Cup and sweeping Oman 3-0, demonstrates their growing strength and potential to cause further upsets.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 01:13 PM\nSource:[theweek.in](https://www.theweek.in/news/sports/2026/02/04/usa-t20-world-cup-2026-team-preview-squad-fixtures-probable-xi-key-players-tournament-prediction.html)\n\n**From winner to leading wicket scorer: Glenn McGrath's bold set of predictions for the T20 World Cup 2026**\nAustralian pace legend Glenn McGrath has made bold predictions for the T20 World Cup 2026 on The Fast Bowling Cartel YouTube channel. He predicts Afghanistan's Rashid Khan will be the leading wicket-taker, citing his 187 T20I wickets in 111 matches, a career economy rate of 6.02, and a bowling average of 13.59. McGrath highlights Rashid\u2019s 2 five-wicket hauls and 9 four-wicket hauls, expecting him to reach 200 T20I wickets during the tournament. For the highest run-scorer, McGrath backs India\u2019s Abhishek Sharma, the current World No. 1 ranked T20I batter, who has a career strike rate of 194.74 and 1,297 runs in 38 innings, including 2 centuries and 8 fifties. McGrath points to Sharma\u2019s 'Player of the Tournament' performance in the 2025 Asia Cup (314 runs) and a recent 249.31 strike rate against New Zealand as evidence of his dominance. McGrath forecasts an India vs South Africa final, predicting India will defend their 2024 title, citing their balanced attack with world-class spin and Jasprit Bumrah\u2019s pace, as well as their advantage playing in subcontinental conditions due to the tournament being hosted by India and Sri Lanka.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 04:14 AM\nSource:[Yardbarker](https://www.yardbarker.com/cricket/articles/from_winner_to_leading_wicket_scorer_glenn_mcgraths_bold_set_of_predictions_for_the_t20_world_cup_2026/s1_17756_43423838)\n\n**High School National Championship in 'Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel' Crowned @\u30a4\u30b0\u30cb\u2606'S as Japan's Best**\nKONAMI held the first-ever 'High School National Championship' for 'Yu-Gi-Oh! Master Duel' on February 1, 2026, featuring 209 teams of high school students from across Japan. The tournament used a double-elimination format with a reset-free Grand Final, and each player could register two decks. The card pool and limit rules were based on the December 2025 'Duelist Cup,' excluding the 'Yami' theme from the 'The Apical Predators' pack and allowing unrestricted use of cards like 'M\u2200LICE' White Rabbit' and 'Dark Temptation'\u2014making 'M\u2200LICE' decks stronger than in the current meta. The final match was contested between @\u30a4\u30b0\u30cb\u2606'S (Ichott and Cheese) and Uchumaguki (Sebek and Nia). @\u30a4\u30b0\u30cb\u2606'S won the championship after a hard-fought battle, defeating Uchumaguki in the Grand Final. Ichott and Cheese, both first-year high school students with about 1.5 years of Master Duel experience, demonstrated exceptional strategic depth, adaptability, and teamwork. Their victory was attributed to mental resilience, especially after losing their first match, and strong deck-building that accounted for the unique tournament environment. They used a mixed 'Demonsmith' and 'Dragon Tail' deck and a 'Tiarament' deck for surprise attacks. The winning team expressed joy and surprise at their victory, citing their passion for Master Duel and strong practice routines. The event also featured insights from commentator Tatsuku, who praised the tournament's team dynamics, the boldness of choosing weaker decks against strong ones, and the importance of personal deck preference.

The championship highlighted the rising talent among young players and set a strong foundation for future events.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 12:00 PM\nSource:[4Gamer](https://www.4gamer.net/games/585/G058543/20260203028/)\n\n**World Cup 2026 predicted as winners, dark horse and England's fate mapped - The Mirror**\nThe Mirror's chief football writers have made predictions for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, the first to feature 48 nations and hosted by the United States, Canada, and Mexico, with the tournament set to take place in summer for the first time since 2018. The top four seeds\u2014Argentina, Spain, France, and England\u2014are seen as the strongest contenders, with Argentina favored to win due to Lionel Messi\u2019s likely final World Cup campaign, a strong squad, and manager Lionel Scaloni\u2019s proven track record. Spain is highlighted for its technical excellence and possession-based style, with Lamine Yamal emerging as a potential star. England is viewed as an outsider in the final four, despite having a talented squad featuring Harry Kane, Declan Rice, Jude Bellingham, and Bukayo Saka, but concerns remain over defensive stability and the physical demands of traveling across three countries and enduring extreme heat. Ecuador is named as a dark horse, with a strong midfield led by Moises Caicedo, potentially advancing deep into the knockout stages. France remains a threat due to Kylian Mbapp\u00e9 and Michael Olise, while Senegal and the USA are also seen as potential surprise performers. The writers caution that the grueling schedule, heat, and travel may reduce on-field quality, with dead-ball situations and substitutions expected to play a larger role. The article notes that only Italy and Brazil have won back-to-back World Cups, and Argentina, having won in 2022, has a realistic chance to repeat. The piece concludes with the prediction that the tournament will be physically taxing, potentially affecting performance, but England\u2019s squad depth could give them an edge if they survive the extended knockout stages.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 10:00 AM\nSource:[Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/sport/football/news/world-cup-2026-predicted-winner-36656145)\n\n**Former cricketer predicts once runners-up to beat India in T20 World Cup 2026 final**\nFormer Australian pacer Jason Gillespie predicts that South Africa, the 2024 T20 World Cup runners-up, will defeat defending champions India in the 2026 T20 World Cup final, which will be held in India and Sri Lanka starting February 7, 2026.

The platform poses questions such as 'Will Thailand experience a military coup before September\u202f2025?' and 'Will Israel strike the Iranian army again before September\u202f2025?' Experts estimate probabilities rather than simple yes/no answers. For example, Metaculus users correctly predicted the Russian invasion of Ukraine two weeks in advance and assigned a 90\u202f% probability to the U.S. v. Wade case roughly two months before it occurred. When the competition began in June, participants expected AI to outperform humans by 40\u202f% on average, but the Mantic AI system achieved over 80\u202f% accuracy. Prediction experts update their forecasts based on policy changes, allowing them to anticipate how virtual political interventions might affect future outcomes. Broad geopolitical forecasting remains extremely difficult, often requiring days and tens of thousands of dollars for a single question. The Rand Corporation estimates that human experts would need months to produce initial forecasts for all questions and to update them regularly. AI excels in data-rich, well-structured domains like weather or quantitative finance, but for geopolitics it must handle many interrelated factors. Large language models use the same complex information as human forecasters and can simulate human judgment, improving over time by predicting many questions, observing performance, and updating methods on a larger scale than humans can. Machines also have an unfair advantage in the competition: participants earn points not only for accuracy but also for coverage, the number of questions answered, and the frequency of updates. Even less accurate AI can rank highly by continuously updating estimates in response to emerging news\u2014a feat impossible for humans. This unfair advantage helps AI overcome the remaining challenge of producing high\u2011quality predictions for all questions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 11:47 AM\nSource:[elnabaa.net](https://www.elnabaa.net/1136072/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%81%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A4-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84)\n\n**AI Beats Humans In Predicting Future At International Competition**\nA British AI startup, Mantic AI, co\u2011founded by a former Google DeepMind researcher, finished eighth in the Metaculus Cup, an international forecasting competition that asked participants to predict the likelihood of 60 events over the summer. The competition included high\u2011profile events such as the public spat between US President Donald Trump and Elon Musk and Kemi Badenoch\u2019s removal from the Conservative Party leadership. Mantic AI\u2019s performance surpassed 80\u202f% of the average score of the top human forecasters, a significant improvement over the 40\u202f% predicted by participants before the contest. Metaculus chief executive Deger Turan called the result 'impressive', while professional forecaster Ben Shindel admitted, 'It's certainly a weird feeling to be outdone by several bots at this point. We've really come a long way here compared with a year ago when the best bot was at something like rank 30.' Co\u2011founder Toby Shevlane noted that the system\u2019s predictions were more original than most human entrants, arguing that \u201cyou could say our system's predictions were more original than most human entrants, because people often cluster around the community average predictions.\u201d Mantic AI uses a mix of machine\u2011learning models from OpenAI, Google and DeepSeek to assign tasks based on each model\u2019s strengths. Experts suggest that AI\u2019s growing predictive accuracy could signal progress toward Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), with a Google DeepMind paper forecasting AGI as early as 2030.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 20, 2025 12:34 PM\nSource:[NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/science/ai-beats-humans-in-predicting-future-at-international-competition-9312972)\n\n**AI Is Learning to Predict the Future -- And Beating Humans at It**\nMetaculus runs a quarterly forecasting cup in which participants predict geopolitical events for a prize pot of about $5,000.
