  "context": "<Summary query=\"Metaculus Cup community vs Nathan Young\">No usable content extracted from any URL.</Summary>\n<Summary query=\"Nathan Young Metaculus Cup interview\">No URLs returned from Google.</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide historical time-series of community prediction for Metaculus question 41508 and past Cup seasons; include any Metaculus notebooks comparing community performance to Nathan Young.\nThe newest round of crawling still fails to surface the three concrete deliverables that the original request asked for, but it does add a few important clues about where the data probably lives and how it can be accessed.\n\n1. Community-prediction time-series for Metaculus question 41508  \n   \u2022 None of the results exposes a CSV/JSON, screenshot, blog post or other public file that already contains the historical forecast curve for Q 41508.  \n   \u2022 However, multiple Metaculus-maintained GitHub repositories now appear in the results and they all reference the same authenticated REST endpoint, /api2/questions/{id}/timeline/.  \n     \u2013 The \u201cmetac-bot-template\u201d repo shows the call sequence a bot uses to fetch a question object and then \u201ctimeline\u201d data before writing a forecast (GitHub \u2013 Metaculus/metac-bot-template).  \n     \u2013 The \u201cforecasting-tools\u201d package (GitHub \u2013 Metaculus/forecasting-tools) wraps the same endpoint and even contains an example notebook (README.ipynb) that calls get_question_timeline and converts the JSON to Pandas.  \n   \u2022 These listings confirm that the timeline is accessible\u2014just not publicly indexed\u2014once a valid Metaculus token is supplied. What is still missing is the actual dump for question 41508; the user (or someone with an account) will have to execute the API call or use the notebook.\n\n2. Archived leaderboards for past Metaculus Cup seasons  \n   \u2022 None of the new hits contains historical Cup standings or season-aggregate files.  \n   \u2022 There are no URLs showing \u201c/api2/cups\u201d, \u201c/api2/tournaments\u201d, \u201ccup_results\u201d, \u201cleaderboard.csv\u201d, etc.  \n   \u2022 The open-source Metaculus web code base (GitHub \u2013 Metaculus/metaculus) does provide Django models named \u201cTournament\u201d, \u201cCup\u201d, and \u201cSeason\u201d, suggesting that the production site serves that information by JSON just like questions and timelines, but the exact endpoint names are not documented in the public code or the docs returned.  \n   \u2022 Bottom line: The data almost certainly exists in the Metaculus database, but no public snapshot or API example is discoverable in open search results; an authenticated scrape (or a request to Metaculus staff) is still required to retrieve past Cup results.\n\n3. Public notebooks comparing Nathan Young\u2019s forecasts to the community  \n   \u2022 No new evidence appeared. None of the GitHub repositories, including the official Metaculus repos, contain an .ipynb file authored by or mentioning Nathan Young.  \n   \u2022 Searches still do not reveal LessWrong, EA Forum, or personal-site posts that link to such notebooks.  \n   \u2022 Therefore either (a) the notebooks do not exist, (b) they are private, or (c) they live under a non-obvious repository/filename that generic keyword search has not detected.\n\nWhat the new results do provide  \n\u2022 Open-source code that proves the timeline endpoint exists and shows exactly how to call it, lowering the effort needed to self-extract the Q 41508 history (Metaculus/forecasting-tools; Metaculus/metac-bot-template).  \n\u2022 Confirmation from the site code (Metaculus/metaculus) that \u201cCup\u201d and \u201cSeason\u201d are first-class objects in the backend; that indicates that a parallel, undocumented API probably exists for Cup leaderboards even though no examples are indexed.  \n\nRemaining information gaps  \n\u2022 A file (CSV, JSON, or image) that actually contains the historical community forecast for question 41508.  \n\u2022 Any machine-readable archive of one or more completed Cup seasons\u2014scores, rank tables, or even a screenshot.  \n\u2022 Any publicly accessible analysis notebook that benchmarks Nathan Young versus the Metaculus community.\n\nRecommended next actions  \nBecause open web search appears exhausted, only targeted, authenticated steps are likely to close the gaps:\n\nA. Log in to Metaculus (or create a free account), obtain the session token (METACULUS_TOKEN), and run:  \n   https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/41508/timeline/  \n   Save the returned JSON, flatten to CSV if needed, and plot the time-series.\n\nB. While still logged in, visit the current Cup leaderboard page in a browser, open the Network tab, and look for calls whose paths start with /api2/. Copy those URLs and replay them with different season query strings (e.g., season=2024-spring) until the historical payload appears.\n\nC. Use the code examples in the \u201cforecasting-tools\u201d or \u201cmetac-bot-template\u201d repos to automate steps A and B; both repos already handle authentication tokens and JSON parsing.\n\nD. Run focused GitHub searches for \u201capi2/questions\u201d + \u201cipynb\u201d OR \u201ccup leaderboard\u201d + \u201cipynb\u201d restricted to filetype:ipynb. Add author filters \u201cuser:nathanpsyoung\u201d or \u201cin:file Nathan Young\u201d to locate any unpublished notebooks.\n\nE. If these programmatic avenues still fail, the only remaining route is to email Metaculus support (support@metaculus.com) or Nathan Young directly and request the private exports.\n\nUntil at least one of these targeted, credential-based steps is carried out, the deliverables requested in the original query cannot be satisfied from publicly indexed material alone.</Agent_report>\n"
