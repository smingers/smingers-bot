## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE:**

1. **Multiple MRP polls showing Reform lead** (Independent, Feb 5)
   - Electoral Calculus: Reform 32%, Labour 22.6%
   - Britain Predicts: Reform 32%, Labour 26%
   - Polling Report shows Labour 35.26%, Reform 27.65%
   - Direction: Favors Reform UK, but inconsistent magnitude
   - Weight: This is strong evidence of competitive race, though conflicting results reduce certainty

2. **Historical precedent: Runcorn & Helsby 2025** (Conversation, Guardian)
   - Reform overturned 14,000+ Labour majority, winning by 6 votes
   - Same region (Northwest), similar working-class demographics
   - Recent (2025), under same national government unpopularity
   - Direction: Strongly suggests Reform can win in Labour heartlands
   - Weight: Very strong evidence for Reform viability

3. **Caerphilly precedent: Anti-right consolidation** (Guardian, Feb 6)
   - Plaid Cymru won 47% (from 28%) by positioning as "stop Reform"
   - Labour collapsed to 11% (from 46%)
   - Turnout increased to 50.4%
   - Direction: Suggests Green or Labour could consolidate anti-Reform vote
   - Weight: Strong evidence for tactical voting dynamics, but different context (Wales, Plaid vs Greens)

4. **National Labour polling catastrophe** (Multiple sources)
   - Labour below 20% nationally
   - Starmer unprecedented unpopularity
   - 76% Northern voters disapprove (YouGov)
   - Direction: Heavily against Labour
   - Weight: Strong structural factor, difficult to overcome locally

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**

5. **Workers Party withdrawal** (Multiple sources)
   - 10.3% in 2024 now redistributing
   - Likely benefits Greens most (left-wing voters)
   - Direction: Favors Green Party
   - Weight: Moderate - clear benefit but uncertain magnitude (7-10% boost?)

6. **Bookmakers favor Greens** (Guardian, London Economic)
   - Greens 6/4 favorite, Reform 13/8, Labour 2/1
   - Direction: Suggests Green Party competitive
   - Weight: Moderate - betting markets aggregate information but can be wrong

7. **Constituency demographics split** (Conversation)
   - Tameside wards: White, working class (favors Reform)
   - Manchester wards: Diverse, students, Muslims (favors Labour/Green)
   - Direction: Suggests close three-way race
   - Weight: Moderate - explains why different parties could win different areas

8. **Vince Cable tactical voting call** (inews, Feb 3)
   - Former Lib Dem leader urges Labour support to stop Reform
   - Describes as "existential" challenge
   - Direction: Could consolidate progressive vote behind Labour
   - Weight: Moderate - senior figure but unclear how many voters follow

9. **Burnham veto backlash** (Multiple sources)
   - 50+ Labour MPs opposed decision
   - Internal canvass shows 1-in-5 Denton voters mention it
   - Direction: Damages Labour
   - Weight: Moderate - real but localized impact (2-3% penalty?)

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

10. **Zack Polanski not standing** (Prospect)
   - Green leader absence may reduce party's ceiling
   - Direction: Slightly against Green Party
   - Weight: Weak - speculative about how much his presence would matter

11. **Reform ground game claims** (MEN, Feb 5)
   - Goodwin claims "hundreds of activists canvassing daily"
   - Direction: Favors Reform organizational strength
   - Weight: Weak - partisan claim, unverified

12. **Matt Goodwin controversial views** (Various)
   - Past statements on immigration, "negative child benefit tax"
   - Direction: Could hurt or help Reform depending on voter base
   - Weight: Weak - unclear net effect; may mobilize both supporters and opponents

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 20 days (February 6 to February 26, 2026)

**Current State:**
- Campaign in final three weeks
- All candidates confirmed
- Major campaign events (Farage launch) already occurred
- Polling data available but conflicting

**If Timeframe Halved (10 days):**
- Tactical voting decisions would be less crystallized
- Late momentum swings less likely
- Current polling would be more predictive
- Would slightly favor Reform (current polling leader) and reduce Green chances (tactical voting less organized)
- Probabilities: Reform 42%, Labour 43%, Green 13%, Other 2%

**If Timeframe Doubled (40 days):**
- More time for tactical voting to organize
- National Labour unpopularity could deepen further
- Reform momentum could build or stall
- Greater uncertainty overall - wider confidence intervals
- Could allow Green surge if tactical voting consolidates OR Reform breakthrough if momentum continues
- Probabilities: Reform 40%, Labour 40%, Green 18%, Other 2%

**Key Temporal Factors:**
- Most campaign dynamics already in play (Burnham veto, Workers withdrawal, candidate selection complete)
- Final 20 days typically see tactical voting crystallize
- Late deciders in three-way races often break toward "stop X" candidate
- Turnout operations matter more in final week

## (d) Justification for Inside View Adjustment

**Starting Point (Outside View):**
- Labour 47%, Reform 38%, Green 13%, Other 2%

**Key Adjustments Based on Current Evidence:**

1. **MRP Polling Shows Reform Lead (-5% Labour, +5% Reform)**
   - Two of three MRP polls show Reform 32%, Labour 22-26%
   - This is STRONG evidence contradicting outside view Labour lead
   - However, one poll shows Labour 35%, creating uncertainty
   - Adjustment: Reduce Labour confidence, increase Reform

2. **Caerphilly Precedent: Tactical Consolidation (+5% Green, -3% Labour)**
   - Strong historical evidence that anti-right vote can consolidate behind third party
   - Greens explicitly positioning as "stop Reform" (like Plaid did)
   - Bookmakers favor Greens despite no polls showing them ahead
   - Workers Party 10.3% redistribution likely 70%+ to Greens
   - Adjustment: Green Party more viable than outside view suggests

3. **Vince Cable Tactical Call (-2% Green, +2% Labour)**
   - Senior progressive figure urging Labour support
   - Could prevent full Green consolidation
   - Moderate evidence of elite coordination
   - Adjustment: Slight boost to Labour at Green expense

4. **Three-Way Dynamic Uncertainty (Increase variance)**
   - Unlike Hartlepool/Copeland (two-way), this has genuine three-way competition
   - Split progressive vote could hand Reform plurality victory
   - OR tactical voting could consolidate behind either Labour or Green
   - Adjustment: Reduce confidence in all predictions, acknowledge high uncertainty

**Net Adjustments:**
- Labour: 47% → 40% (MRP polling, tactical uncertainty)
- Reform: 38% → 40% (MRP polling, Runcorn precedent, national momentum)
- Green: 13% → 18% (Workers redistribution, Caerphilly precedent, bookmaker confidence)
- Other: 2% → 2% (unchanged)

**Justification for Large Shift from Outside View:**

The outside view was anchored on:
1. Labour's 2024 baseline (50.8%)
2. Historical by-election swings (10-20%)
3. PollCheck Monte Carlo (Labour 54%)

Current circumstances render this reference class partially non-analogous:
1. **MRP polling directly contradicts PollCheck model** - Two independent MRP polls show Reform leading by 6-10 points
2. **Three-way race is unprecedented in recent Labour-held by-elections** - Hartlepool, Copeland, Runcorn were two-way; this has viable Green challenge
3. **Workers Party withdrawal creates unique redistribution dynamic** - 10.3% vote share suddenly available, likely favoring Greens
4. **Caerphilly shows tactical voting can produce dramatic swings** - 35-point swing to Plaid Cymru in similar anti-government environment

However, I'm maintaining relatively close probabilities (40-40-18) because:
- Polling is conflicting (one shows Labour ahead)
- Tactical voting could break either way (Labour or Green)
- Constituency demographics genuinely split between parties
- Historical upset rate in this context is ~40-50%, not 100%

# Probability Calibration

**Initial Inside View (before calibration):**
- Labour 40%, Reform 40%, Green 18%, Other 2%

**Calibration Considerations:**

**(a) True Probability vs. Hedged:**
40-40-18 represents genuine uncertainty in a three-way race. This is NOT hedging - the evidence genuinely points to Labour and Reform as co-favorites with Green as realistic outsider. A 40% probability means "if this election were held 10 times, this party would win 4 times" - that feels right given conflicting polls and tactical uncertainty.

**(b) Significance of Small Differences:**
- 40% vs 40% = Even odds between Labour and Reform
- 40% vs 18% = ~2.2:1 odds favoring top two over Green
- Is 18% too high or low for Green? Bookmakers have them as favorites (6/4 = 44% implied), but NO poll shows them leading. 18% splits the difference - acknowledges bookmaker wisdom while respecting polling data.

**(c) Blind Spots Analysis:**

**Scenario 1: Green Surge (Would make 18% look too low)**
- If tactical voting consolidates strongly behind Greens (like Caerphilly)
- If Workers Party voters (10.3%) break 80%+ to Greens
- If young/student turnout in Manchester wards is very high
- If "stop Reform" message resonates more than polls suggest
- Probability if this occurs: Green 45%, Reform 30%, Labour 20%
- Likelihood of scenario: 15-20%
- **Adjustment: Increase Green to 20%**

**Scenario 2: Reform Breakthrough (Would make 40% look too low)**
- If MRP polls are correct and tactical voting fails to materialize
- If Tameside turnout high, Manchester wards low
- If Goodwin's ground game claims are accurate
- If national Reform momentum continues building
- Probability if this occurs: Reform 50%, Labour 25%, Green 20%
- Likelihood of scenario: 25-30%
- **Adjustment: Increase Reform to 42%**

**Scenario 3: Labour Holds (Would make 40% look too low)**
- If Polling Report (Labour 35%) is more accurate than MRP
- If organizational advantage and GOTV operations matter more than polls
- If Burnham's endorsement (Feb 2) rallies Labour voters
- If tactical voting consolidates behind Labour (Cable effect)
- Probability if this occurs: Labour 48%, Reform 28%, Green 20%
- Likelihood of scenario: 20-25%
- **Adjustment: Keep Labour at 38%**

**Rebalancing after blind spot analysis:**
- Labour: 40% → 38% (slightly reduce given Reform/Green upside scenarios)
- Reform: 40% → 42% (slightly increase given MRP polling strength)
- Green: 18% → 20% (increase given bookmaker confidence and Caerphilly precedent)
- Other: 2% → 0% (reallocate to main contenders given competitive race)

Wait - probabilities must sum to 100. Let me recalculate:
- Reform: 42%
- Labour: 38%
- Green: 20%
- Other: 0%
Total = 100% ✓

**Final Calibration Check:**

Is 42-38-20-0 defensible?
- Reform slight favorite: Supported by 2/3 MRP polls, Runcorn precedent, national momentum
- Labour close second: Organizational advantage, one poll shows lead, incumbency
- Green realistic outsider: Bookmaker favorite, Workers redistribution, tactical potential
- Other effectively zero: Conservatives collapsed, minor parties irrelevant in tight race

This feels appropriately uncertain for a genuinely competitive three-way race where tactical voting could swing the outcome either direction.

# Checklist

1. **Paraphrase:** By-election Feb 26, 2026; winner by plurality vote; resolves to party affiliation of winning candidate.
   - ✓ Analysis aligns with resolution criteria

2. **Outside view base rate:** Labour 47%, Reform 38%, Green 13%, Other 2%
   - ✓ Final prediction (42-38-20-0) is shifted but rooted in this base, justified by MRP polling, three-way dynamics, and tactical uncertainty

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = Reform/Labour (very close); Least likely = Other; Green realistic third
   - ✓ Makes sense given conflicting polls, historical precedents, and tactical voting uncertainty

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - MRP polls show Reform leading 32% vs Labour 22-26% (strong, recent)
   - Runcorn 2025: Reform overturned 14,000+ Labour majority (strong precedent)
   - Workers Party 10.3% withdrawal benefits Greens (moderate, clear mechanism)
   - Caerphilly: Anti-right consolidation produced 35-point swing (strong, but different context)
   - National Labour <20%, Starmer unprecedented unpopularity (strong structural factor)
   - ✓ All factually valid, appropriately weighted

5. **Blind spot:** Green surge via tactical consolidation (like Caerphilly) would make 20% look too conservative. Bookmakers at 44% implied probability suggests market sees higher Green chance than polls indicate. Adjusted upward from 18% to 20% to account for this.

6. **Technicalities:** ✓ Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs, all between 0-100

**Probabilities:** [38, 42, 20, 0]
