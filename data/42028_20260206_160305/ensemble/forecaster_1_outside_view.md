- Burnham candidacy blocked by NEC

**Expert Opinions to Weight:**

- PollCheck modeling: Labour slight favorite but highly uncertain
- Multiple sources: Tactical voting could be decisive

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Recent Labour-held by-elections under unpopular Labour governments**
   - Copeland 2017 (lost to Con, 6.7% swing)
   - Hartlepool 2021 (lost to Con, 16% swing)
   - Runcorn & Helsby 2025 (lost to Reform by 6 votes, overturning 14,000+ majority)
   - Suitability: HIGH - most directly relevant, shows Labour vulnerability in traditional seats

2. **Safe-seat by-elections with governing party collapse**
   - Tamworth 2023 (23.9% swing to Labour from Con)
   - Mid-Bedfordshire 2023 (20.5% swing to Labour from Con)
   - Suitability: MEDIUM - shows large swings possible but direction reversed

3. **Three-way marginal by-elections**
   - Various local council by-elections with split opposition
   - Suitability: MEDIUM-LOW - less data, different dynamics

4. **Manchester/Greater Manchester elections specifically**
   - Andy Burnham mayoral wins (68,000 majority)
   - All 5 Manchester constituencies Labour-held
   - Suitability: LOW for this specific case - national anti-Labour mood overrides local loyalty

**Chosen Reference Class: Recent Labour-held by-elections under unpopular Labour governments (#1)**

This is most suitable because:
- Directly comparable political dynamics (governing party unpopularity)
- Same party defending
- Recent enough to reflect modern volatility
- Runcorn & Helsby 2025 is particularly relevant (same region, similar demographics, Reform challenger)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 20 days (Feb 6 to Feb 26, 2026)

**Historical Patterns Over Similar Periods:**
- By-election campaigns typically 4-6 weeks; this is in final 3 weeks
- Late momentum can shift 5-10 points in final weeks (e.g., Lib Dem surges in 2023)
- However, current polling already reflects most campaign dynamics
- MRP polls typically stabilize in final 2-3 weeks

**Key Temporal Factors:**
1. Workers Party withdrawal already factored into current environment
2. Burnham veto controversy occurred weeks ago - already priced in
3. Goodwin's controversial statements now public - damage/benefit already occurring
4. National Labour polling has been consistently dire for months - unlikely to suddenly recover
5. Tactical voting decisions typically crystallize in final 10 days

## (d) Justification for Outside View

**Integrating Key Factors:**

1. **Base Rate (2024 result):** Labour 50.8%, Reform 14.1%, Green 13.2%, Workers 10.3%

2. **National Swing:** Labour down ~14-16 points nationally since 2024; this should apply to baseline

3. **Workers Party Redistribution:** 10.3% to allocate
   - Agent report suggests 70% to Green, 15% Labour, 15% Reform
   - This would add: Green +7.2%, Labour +1.5%, Reform +1.5%

4. **Historical Precedent Adjustment:**
   - Runcorn & Helsby (2025): Labour lost 14,000+ majority to Reform
   - Hartlepool (2021): 16% swing against Labour
   - Average "upset" swing in unpopular government by-elections: 10-20%

5. **Local Factors:**
   - Burnham veto: Depresses Labour by ~2-3% (1-in-5 voters in some wards)
   - Constituency split: Tameside wards favor Reform; Manchester wards favor Green/Labour
   - Tactical voting: Could consolidate anti-Reform vote behind either Labour or Green

6. **Polling Evidence:**
   - MRP polls show Reform leading (32% vs Labour 22-26%)
   - One poll shows Labour holding (35% vs Reform 28%)
   - PollCheck Monte Carlo: Labour 54%, Reform 38%, Green 8%
   - Significant uncertainty in all models

7. **Three-Way Dynamic:**
   - Unlike Hartlepool/Copeland (two-way), this has viable Green challenge
   - Split opposition to Labour could paradoxically help Labour win plurality
   - But split left-of-center vote could hand victory to Reform

**Synthesis:**

Starting from 2024 baseline and applying:
- National swing (-15% Labour)
- Workers redistribution (+7% Green, +1.5% Labour, +1.5% Reform)
- Burnham penalty (-2% Labour)
- Tactical consolidation uncertainty (±5% between Labour/Green)

**Rough calculation:**
- Labour: 50.8 - 15 + 1.5 - 2 = 35.3% (but high uncertainty)
- Reform: 14.1 + 1.5 + (national surge) = ~28-32%
- Green: 13.2 + 7.2 = 20.4%

This suggests Labour narrow plurality most likely, but Reform has genuine chance, and Green could surge if tactical voting consolidates left.

Outside view calibration:

## Calibration Considerations

**(a) True Probability vs. Hedged Prediction:**
I must avoid both overconfidence and excessive hedging. The evidence genuinely points to a competitive three-way race with Labour as narrow favorite but substantial Reform and non-trivial Green chances.

**(b) Previously Established Distributions:**
- PollCheck Monte Carlo: Labour 54%, Reform 38%, Green 8%
- This provides a useful anchor, though it may underweight Green tactical voting potential
- Historical by-election upsets suggest 30-40% chance of incumbent loss in current climate

**(c) Significance of Small Probability Differences:**
- 54% vs 38% represents roughly 3:2 odds for Labour vs Reform
- Given uncertainty in tactical voting and turnout, this seems appropriate
- Green at 8% may be too low given Workers Party redistribution and tactical potential

**(d) Rate of Upsets in This Domain:**
Recent by-elections show:
- Runcorn & Helsby 2025: Complete upset (Labour lost)
- Hartlepool 2021: Complete upset (Labour lost)
- Tamworth/Mid-Beds 2023: Upsets (but against Conservatives)
- Upset rate in unpopular-government by-elections: ~40-50%

However, "upset" here is ambiguous - is Reform winning an "upset" given current national polls show them leading? Perhaps Labour holding is actually the "upset" scenario.

**Adjustments to PollCheck baseline:**

1. **Green Party underestimated:** Workers Party 10.3% redistribution likely benefits Greens more than 8% final share suggests. Tactical anti-Reform voting among progressive voters could consolidate behind Greens in Manchester wards. Adjust Green up to 12-15%.

2. **Labour-Reform toss-up:** MRP polls show Reform leading; PollCheck shows Labour leading. True probability likely closer to 50-50 between these two. Both have genuine paths to victory.

3. **Conservative/Other collapse:** Conservatives at 7.9% in 2024 will likely drop to 3-5% given national collapse. Lib Dems, minor parties collectively 2-3%.

4. **Uncertainty bands:** Given conflicting polls and unprecedented national environment, confidence intervals are wide. Any outcome between Labour 30-40%, Reform 25-35%, Green 15-25% seems plausible.

**Final Calibration:**

Weighing all evidence:
- Labour has organizational advantage and baseline plurality, but faces catastrophic national environment
- Reform has momentum and national polls, but faces tactical voting and constituency demographics
- Green has Workers Party transfers and tactical potential, but starts from third
- "Other" (Conservative + minor parties) extremely unlikely given dynamics

My calibrated probabilities should reflect:
- Labour slight favorite but not dominant (45-50%)
- Reform strong challenger (35-40%)
- Green realistic outsider (10-15%)
- Other minimal (1-2%)

Outside View Prediction:

Labour Party: 47%
Reform UK: 38%
Green Party: 13%
Other: 2%
