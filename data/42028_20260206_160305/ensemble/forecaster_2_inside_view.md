## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE:**

1. **Multiple MRP polls showing tight three-way race** (Independent, Feb 5): Three independent models all show Labour vulnerability, though they disagree on who leads. Electoral Calculus and Britain Predicts favor Reform; Polling Report favors Labour. This is structural evidence of genuine competitiveness.

2. **Caerphilly precedent** (Guardian, Feb 6): Labour dropped from 46% to 11% in similar circumstances (unpopular government, safe seat, left-alternative available). Direct historical parallel with clear causal mechanism: anti-right vote consolidated behind Plaid once Labour seen as non-viable.

3. **Bookmaker consensus** (multiple sources, Jan 26-Feb 6): Professional betting markets favor Greens, then Reform, then Labour. Bookmakers aggregate diverse information sources and have financial incentives for accuracy. This represents strong market intelligence.

4. **Workers Party withdrawal** (confirmed multiple sources): Galloway's 10% 2024 vote share now available for redistribution, likely favoring Greens over Labour given ideological proximity and anti-Starmer sentiment.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**

1. **Reform's ground game** (Manchester Evening News, Feb 5): Farage/Goodwin report "hundreds of activists canvassing daily" vs "minimal Labour and Green activity." If accurate, suggests Reform organizational advantage. However, partisan source (Reform candidate) reduces reliability.

2. **Vince Cable tactical voting appeal** (Feb 3): Former major party leader publicly urging LibDems to vote Labour suggests establishment concern about Reform threat. Cable's credibility adds weight, but LibDems only won 3.8% in 2024 (limited impact).

3. **National polling collapse** (multiple sources): Labour below 20% nationally, Starmer 76% disapproval in North. Creates hostile environment for Labour defense but doesn't directly predict local outcome.

4. **Burnham endorsement of Stogia** (Feb 2): Popular mayor backing Labour candidate could shore up support, but his initial blocking may have already damaged enthusiasm. Mixed signal.

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

1. **Anecdotal canvassing reports**: Various vox pops showing voter frustration with Labour, but these are cherry-picked and not representative samples.

2. **Candidate quality speculation**: Claims about Goodwin's recognizability or Spencer's local ties. Candidate effects typically small in UK by-elections dominated by national issues.

3. **Social media momentum**: Green Party claiming "people power" advantage. Unmeasurable and historically unreliable predictor.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 20 days until Feb 26, 2026 election.

**If halved to 10 days**: Would increase confidence in current polling/betting snapshot, as less time for late swings. Historical UK by-election data shows most movement occurs 2-4 weeks out; final week typically sees 1-2 point shifts maximum. Would increase weight on current bookmaker odds (Greens favored).

**If doubled to 40 days**: Would reduce confidence significantly. More time for:
- New scandals/revelations about candidates
- National political events affecting mood
- Tactical voting coordination to crystallize
- Campaign spending effects to materialize
Would warrant staying closer to outside view base rates given uncertainty.

**Current 20-day window**: Middle ground. Enough time for tactical voting messaging to spread (Cable appeal, Labour's "stop Reform" push) but not enough for major structural shifts. Bookmaker odds and MRP polls represent best current information but shouldn't be treated as definitive.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view baseline**: 60% Labour, 25% Reform, 13% Green, 2% Other

**Key factors warranting adjustment:**

1. **Bookmaker consensus contradicts outside view** (STRONG): Professional markets favor Greens (6/4), not Labour. This is a 3-4 sigma departure from historical safe-seat defense rates. Bookmakers have been remarkably accurate in recent UK by-elections (correctly predicted Runcorn upset, Caerphilly).

2. **Caerphilly mechanism directly applicable** (STRONG): The precedent shows that once Labour is seen as non-viable in a three-way race, anti-Reform voters consolidate rapidly behind the strongest alternative. Multiple sources (Guardian, Labour MPs, Cable) suggest this dynamic is already emerging with Greens positioned as Reform-stopper.

3. **Three-way polling split** (STRONG): Unlike typical Labour-held by-elections where Labour leads clearly, all three MRP models show margins within 3-10 points. This structural uncertainty justifies moving away from confident Labour win toward genuine three-way toss-up.

4. **Workers Party withdrawal** (MODERATE): 10% vote share now in play. Given WPB's left-populist positioning and Galloway's anti-Starmer stance, these voters likely split 60-70% Green, 20-30% Reform, <10% Labour. This adds ~6-7 points to Green potential.

5. **Tactical voting coordination** (MODERATE): Cable's public appeal and Labour MPs' private briefings suggest establishment recognizing need to consolidate anti-Reform vote. However, unclear whether this favors Labour or Greens. Guardian analysis suggests Greens better positioned as Reform-stopper given Labour's national toxicity.

**Why current circumstances differ from reference class:**

The outside view reference class (safe Labour seats with >20 point majorities) assumes:
- Clear Labour organizational advantage
- No serious left-wing alternative
- Binary Labour-vs-challenger dynamic

Gorton & Denton violates all three:
- Labour organization weakened by Burnham controversy
- Greens present credible left alternative (local councillor, Workers Party endorsement)
- True three-way race creates coordination problem

**Magnitude of adjustment:**

Given STRONG evidence from multiple independent sources (bookmakers, MRP polls, Caerphilly precedent, WPB withdrawal), I justify moving Labour from 60% to ~35% (25-point drop). This is a large shift but supported by:
- Bookmaker odds implying ~30-35% Labour chance
- MRP polls showing Labour trailing in 2/3 models
- Caerphilly showing 35-point Labour drop is possible in weeks

Split the remaining probability:
- **Greens**: Bookmaker favorite + tactical anti-Reform positioning + WPB votes → 40%
- **Reform**: Strong in 2/3 MRP polls + ground game + national momentum → 23%
- **Other**: Minimal (Conservatives 200/1 odds) → 2%

# Probability Calibration

**Initial outside view**: Labour 60%, Reform 25%, Green 13%, Other 2%

**Calibration considerations:**

1. **90% vs 99% distinction**: My initial outside view put Labour at 60%, which is only 3:2 odds—barely favored. This already reflected substantial uncertainty. Moving to 35% (roughly 2:1 against) represents recognizing that multiple strong signals point away from Labour.

2. **Confidence check on Green 40%**: This makes Greens slight favorites (3:2 odds). Is this justified?
   - YES: Bookmakers explicitly favor Greens
   - YES: Caerphilly shows left-alternative can surge 19 points in weeks
   - YES: WPB withdrawal adds ~7 points to Green potential
   - CAUTION: No constituency poll confirms Green lead; all evidence is indirect

3. **Reform at 23%**: Down from outside view 25% despite leading in 2/3 MRP polls. Why?
   - Bookmakers rank Reform second, not first
   - Tactical voting coordination specifically targets Reform
   - Caerphilly precedent shows Reform can be squeezed when left consolidates
   - However, Reform has strongest ground game and national momentum
   - 23% reflects genuine chance but not favorite status

4. **Blind spots**:
   - **Most likely surprise**: Labour wins with ~40% via late tactical consolidation. Cable appeal + Burnham endorsement + "stop Reform" messaging could work. If I'm wrong, it's because I over-weighted bookmaker odds and under-weighted Labour's institutional advantages.
   - **Second surprise**: Reform wins with ~35% via split left vote. If Green/Labour split evenly (25-25), Reform wins with plurality. This is the Caerphilly-in-reverse scenario.

5. **Probability sum check**: 35 + 23 + 40 + 2 = 100 ✓

**Final calibration**: Given strong but not definitive evidence, I'm treating this as a genuine three-way race with Greens marginally favored. The 40-35-23 split reflects:
- Greens: Bookmaker favorite + tactical positioning + WPB boost
- Labour: Institutional advantages + Burnham endorsement + still viable
- Reform: Strong polls + ground game but facing tactical squeeze
- Other: Negligible

# Checklist

1. **Paraphrase**: Winner of Feb 26, 2026 by-election in Gorton & Denton among Labour, Reform, Green, or Other parties.

2. **Base rate**: Outside view 60% Labour, 25% Reform, 13% Green, 2% Other. Final prediction shifts significantly based on strong current evidence (bookmakers, MRP polls, Caerphilly precedent).

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = Green (40%), Labour (35%); Least likely = Other (2%). Makes sense given bookmaker consensus, three-way polling, and tactical voting dynamics creating genuine uncertainty.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Bookmakers favor Greens 6/4, Reform 13/8, Labour 2/1 (strong market signal)
   - Caerphilly precedent: Labour dropped 35 points when left consolidated behind alternative (strong historical parallel)
   - Workers Party 10% withdrawal benefits Greens (moderate structural factor)
   - Multiple MRP polls show tight three-way race within 10 points (strong polling evidence)
   - Vince Cable tactical voting appeal signals establishment concern (moderate elite opinion)

5. **Blind spot**: Labour wins via late tactical consolidation around "stop Reform" message, leveraging institutional advantages and Burnham's endorsement. Would make my 35% look too low. Alternatively, Reform wins via perfect left-vote split (25-25), making my 23% too low.

6. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % symbols.

**Probabilities**: [35, 23, 40, 2]
