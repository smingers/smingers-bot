Analysis:

1) Resolution / options (paraphrase)
This resolves to the party that wins the Gorton & Denton Westminster by-election held 26 Feb 2026 (FPTP). Options: Labour, Reform UK, Green, or any other party.

2) (a) Source analysis (facts vs opinions; quality; date)

- WhoCanIVoteFor (voter info page; accessed Feb 6, 2026)
  - Quality: Medium (administrative info; not analysis).
  - Facts: election date; by-election due to resignation; FPTP; many candidates.
  - No meaningful opinion/predictive content.

- BBC (Feb 3, 2026) “Communist League reveals…”
  - Quality: High for factual candidate/nomination info.
  - Facts: 11 candidates; Communist League candidate; triggered by Gwynne resignation.
  - No predictive content.

- Sky News (Feb 5, 2026) candidate list
  - Quality: High for the candidate slate.
  - Facts: confirms 11 candidates and major-party names (Labour Stogia, Reform Goodwin, Green Spencer, etc.).
  - No polling/prediction.

- The Guardian (Feb 6, 2026) comment piece (Will Hayward)
  - Quality: Medium (commentary, but cites concrete Caerphilly numbers).
  - Facts: Caerphilly by-election result dynamics; spending; turnout stats.
  - Opinion: bookies “Greens favoured”; narrative that Labour may repeat mistakes; tactical-vote dynamics. Treat as suggestive, not dispositive.

- The Independent (Feb 5, 2026) “Could Labour lose… here’s what polls say”
  - Quality: High for summarizing polling and context (but still secondary reporting).
  - Facts: 2024 result (Lab 50.8 / Reform 14.1 / Green 13.2); turnout; candidates; several MRP/predictive-model estimates.
  - Opinion: unnamed Labour MPs speculating Greens benefit from tactical voting (weak-to-moderate due to anonymity and incentives).

- The Conversation (Jan 30, 2026) academic analysis (Louise Thompson)
  - Quality: High (domain-informed, generally careful).
  - Facts: constituency composition/history; national-attitude poll datapoint; Runcorn precedent; by-election framing.
  - Opinion: mechanism risk—Labour “squeezed”; Reform path via left split; tactical anti-Reform voters may stick with Labour.

- Manchester Evening News (Feb 1–5, 2026; multiple live/campaign pieces)
  - Quality: Medium-high on local event reporting; low on inference.
  - Facts: Farage appearances; Reform campaign launch/office; messaging; claims about ground operation; controversy references.
  - Opinion/claims: Reform asserting Labour/Green are inactive and that campaign is going well—partisan, treat cautiously.

- Al Jazeera (Feb 4, 2026) reported-from-the-ground piece
  - Quality: Medium-high (credible outlet, but based on small-N interviews).
  - Facts: race is multi-party; Burnham blocked; quotes from local voters across perspectives.
  - Opinion: “tight contest” based on reporting impressions (weak-to-moderate).

- inews (Feb 3, 2026) Vince Cable tactical-voting call
  - Quality: Medium-high for the fact Cable said it; low for forecasting accuracy.
  - Facts: explicit attempt to push progressive tactical voting toward Labour (anti-Reform coordination signal).
  - Opinion: Cable’s “duty” argument is normative; but the existence of coordination attempts is relevant.

- Prospect (Feb 4, 2026) “Polanski missed opportunity”
  - Quality: Medium (political analysis/opinion).
  - Facts: notes Greens didn’t run their leader; frames implications.
  - Opinion-heavy; useful mainly as hypothesis about candidate salience.

- The London Economic (Jan 26 / Feb 2, 2026) bookies + Burnham endorsement coverage
  - Quality: Medium (aggregates odds; partisan-ish tone at times).
  - Facts: bookies pricing Greens as early favourites; Burnham publicly backing Labour candidate.
  - Opinion: odds interpretation; “odds-on” narratives—use cautiously but markets can be informative.

- The Express (Feb 4, 2026) “Your Party” chaos
  - Quality: Low-medium (tabloid; but the key fact—no candidate—can be true).
  - Facts (if accurate): Corbyn’s party not standing; Sultana backing Greens. Treat as tentative unless confirmed elsewhere; still directionally plausible given final candidate list lacks “Your Party”.

3) (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence
- Candidate slate locked (Sky/BBC): Greens, Labour, Reform all stand serious candidates; no obvious single “unity” challenger. (Structural: fixed until election.)
- National context of Labour severe unpopularity (given in background + consistent across reporting). (Structural-ish over 20 days; hard to reverse quickly.)
- FPTP fragmentation: winner can emerge with ~30–40% if opposition splits; this structurally benefits the most unified bloc/most energized turnout.

Moderate evidence
- Model/polling snapshots (Independent): multiple MRPs show Reform ahead; one shows Labour ahead. Methodologies differ; but direction suggests true win-prob near coin-flip between Labour/Reform, with Greens as outsider.
- Reform intensity/leader visits (MEN): Farage + campaign office + “referendum on Starmer” framing plausibly raises salience/turnout among Reform-inclined voters.
- Tactical-voting signals (inews/Cable; Labour messaging; Burnham endorsement): attempts to consolidate anti-Reform vote behind Labour could squeeze Greens and raise Labour’s win probability.

Weak evidence
- Bookmaker “Greens favourites” (Guardian/London Economic): informative but can reflect thin markets, hedging, and narrative trades; still a weak-to-moderate signal Greens are more live than raw polls imply.
- Anecdotal voter interviews (Al Jazeera) and partisan claims about opponent ground-game (MEN): directionally useful, not quantifiable.
- Commentary analogies to Caerphilly (Guardian): relevant as a cautionary tale, but Plaid-vs-Green and Wales-vs-GM differences limit transferability.

Key “Yes” pathways (by party)
- Reform wins if: Labour vote collapses further + Green takes enough progressive vote to deny Labour + Reform turnout high (and/or low-ID/low-turnout environment hurts Labour/Green more).
- Labour wins if: anti-Reform tactical voting coalesces behind Labour (including some LibDem/Green leaners) + Burnham endorsement mends fences + Reform ceiling in diverse Manchester wards holds.
- Green wins if: progressive tactical vote shifts decisively to Green as “best anti-Reform vehicle” AND Labour collapses; requires a coordination breakthrough not yet evidenced by polls.

4) (c) Timeframe analysis
Time left: 20 days (Feb 6 → Feb 26, 2026).
- If timeframe halved (10 days left): less time for coordination shifts; I’d slightly increase weight on current momentum/ground game (modest uptick Reform; modest downtick Green as “late tactical surge” needs time/signals).
- If timeframe doubled (40 days left): more time for tactical-vote campaigns, endorsements, and local scandals to reshape coordination; I’d slightly increase uncertainty and lift Green’s upset chances (coordination can flip late), while reducing confidence in Reform’s current edge.

5) (d) Justification (inside-view adjustments from outside-view base rates)

Outside-view base rates provided:
Labour 47, Reform 41, Green 11, Other 1.

Inside-view adjustments:
- Reform up (moderate): Multiple MRPs/forecasts in Independent place Reform ahead; Farage/Goodwin high-intensity campaign suggests higher motivation and turnout. In a low-turnout by-election, that often matters more than in a general election.
- Labour down (moderate): Burnham blocked remains a demobilizing/resentment factor; Labour’s “only we can stop Reform” message may or may not land given government unpopularity. Burnham endorsement helps, but it’s not the same as him being the candidate.
- Green slightly up (small-to-moderate): bookies pricing + left fragmentation + absence of some far-left candidacy (implied by final list; and reported Sultana backing) marginally improves the Green “coordination” story. But the hard constraint is: no polling cited has Greens leading, and Labour is explicitly running a tactical squeeze campaign—so Green remains an outsider, not co-favourite.
- Other stays ~1: many minor candidates exist, but no evidence any can win under FPTP here.

Net: move from “Labour slight favourite” to “Reform slight favourite,” with Green a meaningful but still secondary upset path.

Probability calibration
- I’m avoiding overconfidence because: (i) three-way tactical dynamics are genuinely hard to model, (ii) seat demographics are mixed (“Frankenstein” constituency), and (iii) available numbers are MRPs/models not robust constituency polling.
- ±10% sensitivity: A 10-point swing between Labour and Reform is very plausible if tactical voting clarifies late (either direction). Green could also jump if a credible tactical-voting signal emerges (e.g., major progressive org endorsements), but absent that I keep Green’s win chance in the low teens.
- Main blind spot: differential impact of voter ID / turnout composition. If it disproportionately depresses Labour/Green-heavy groups (young, low-propensity, some minority voters), Reform’s win probability could be materially higher than I’m assigning.

Checklist:
1) Resolves to winning party of the 26 Feb 2026 by-election in Gorton & Denton (FPTP).
2) Outside view used: [47, 41, 11, 1].
3) Consistency: Most likely = Reform/Labour (near coin-flip); least likely = Other. Yes.
4) Top evidence: (i) MRPs show Reform often ahead; (ii) Farage/ground game may boost Reform turnout; (iii) Labour tactical squeeze + Burnham endorsement; (iv) Greens not leading in polls but viable via coordination; (v) fragmented field under FPTP.
5) Blind spot: late tactical-vote coordination (or turnout/ID effects) could sharply flip Labour↔Reform or enable a Green upset.
6) Probabilities sum to 100; all between 0 and 100.

Probabilities: [42, 45, 12, 1]
