Analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------
(a) SOURCE ANALYSIS  (ordered by publication date)

1. 26 Jan – London Economic (bookmaker odds)  
 • Facts: early odds (Greens 6/4, Reform 13/8, Lab 2/1).  
 • Opinions: market‐driven commentary, no polling.  
 • Quality: medium; betting markets thin but aggregate many judgements.

2. 26 Jan – LabourList (NEC blocks Burnham)  
 • Facts: NEC ruling, MP reactions.  
 • Opinions: factional framing.  
 • Quality: high on factual decision, low on spin.

3. 30 Jan – The Conversation (seat profile)  
 • Facts: 2024 result, demographic split, prior by-election swings.  
 • Opinions: academic interpretation of split-vote danger.  
 • Quality: high for descriptive data, moderate for opinions.

4. 1–5 Feb – Manchester Evening News, Sky, ITV (candidate list, campaign launches)  
 • Facts: 11 confirmed candidates, campaign activity.  
 • Quality: high for candidate data; anecdotal canvass colour = low.

5. 02 Feb – Al Jazeera (vox-pops)  
 • Facts: reiterates candidate list, local grievances.  
 • Quality: moderate; interviews anecdotal.

6. 03 Feb – BBC (Communist League candidate)  
 • Facts only; negligible electoral impact.

7. 03 Feb – iNews (Vince Cable tactical-vote call)  
 • Facts: senior LD urging vote Labour.  
 • Quality: high; statement on record.

8. 04–06 Feb – Independent (poll round-up, Starmer/Rayner piece) & Guardian (Caerphilly lessons)  
 • Facts: three MRPs (Reform 32/Lab 23; Reform 32/Lab 26; Lab 35/Reform 28).  
 • Opinions: interpretation of tactical-vote prospects.  
 • Quality: MRPs are modelled not polled; treat as moderate evidence.

9. 05 Feb – London Economic/Metro (Burnham endorses Stogia; Green op-ed)  
 • Facts: Burnham now active for Labour; Workers Party stood down.  
 • Quality: high for endorsement fact; low for partisan rhetoric.

(b) EVIDENCE WEIGHTING

Strong  
• Governing party by-election penalty: historically ~10–15 pt swing against.  
• 2024 arithmetic: opposition combined vote (46 %) > Labour majority, proving path for upset.  
• Fragmented three-way contest under FPTP regularly produces winners in low-30 % range.

Moderate  
• Three separate MRPs show close race, 2 give Reform narrow lead.  
• Bookmakers initially priced Greens favourite, signalling genuine uncertainty.  
• Burnham blocked (reduces Labour enthusiasm) but now campaigns for party (partial mitigation).  
• LibDem elder call for tactical voting to Labour; Workers Party not standing (helps Greens).

Weak  
• Launch-rally crowd sizes, social-media buzz, individual vox-pops.  
• Speculation about last-minute scandals.

(c) TIMEFRAME ANALYSIS

Days to poll: 20.  If campaign period were halved (10 days) I would raise inertia-favouring Labour (+3 pts).  Doubled (40 days) gives challengers more time to consolidate, cutting Labour (-4 pts).

(d) JUSTIFICATION OF SHIFTS FROM OUTSIDE VIEW

Outside view (6 Feb a.m.) 58 / 30 / 10 / 2.

Adjustments:

1. MRPs + bookmaker odds indicate Labour no longer clear front-runner (-10 Lab, +5 Reform, +4 Green).  
2. Tactical-voting signals (Cable, WPB absence) tilt a slice of progressive vote back to Labour ( +4 Lab, -3 Green).  
3. Burnham visible on Labour stump dampens “snub” narrative (+3 Lab).  
4. Reform’s high-profile Goodwin candidacy and intensive ground game (+3 Reform).  
Net result: Labour down modestly, Reform up, Greens up slightly.

Blind-spot: rapid late-campaign coordination around “Stop Reform” could swing decisive tactical votes to Greens instead of Labour (e.g., major progressive endorsement, compelling local poll).  Would mainly hurt Labour, lift Greens.

Probability calibration
----------------------------------------------------------------
Labour still single most likely; however combined chance of non-Labour win ≈55 %.  Spread assigns material but smaller probability to Greens than Reform because: (a) no poll yet places Greens first; (b) they must leapfrog both parties.

Final probabilities (sum = 100):

Labour Party – 45  
Reform UK – 35  
Green Party – 18  
Other – 2

Checklist (abridged)
1. Options: party of winning candidate in 26 Feb 2026 Gorton & Denton by-election.  
2. Base rate 58/30/10/2 → updated as above.  
3. Most likely = Labour; least likely = Other.  Consistent.  
4. Key evidence: governing-party by-election swing; 2024 vote math; three MRPs; bookmaker odds; Burnham endorsement.  
5. Blind spot: late “Stop Reform” push coalesces around Greens.  
6. Probs 0-100, sum 100.

Probabilities: [45, 35, 18, 2]
