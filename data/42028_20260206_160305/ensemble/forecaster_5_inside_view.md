Analysis
A. Source analysis (abbreviated – date / type / quality)
1. Sky (5 Feb) – straight candidate list, high factual, no opinion.  
2. BBC (3 Feb) – Communist League candidate, high factual, irrelevant to winner (weak evidence).  
3. Manchester Evening News bundle (2-5 Feb) – on-the-ground campaign reports; generally factual quotes, moderate quality; clear Reform ground-game evidence but mostly anecdotal.  
4. Independent (5 Feb) – three MRP seat-polls; good methodology notes, high quality for numbers, commentary from unnamed MPs = opinion.  
5. Guardian (6 Feb) – Will Hayward column comparing Caerphilly; facts about past result solid, forward-looking part opinion.  
6. The Conversation (30 Jan) – academic explainer with 2024 figures, moderate quality; opinions clearly labelled.  
7. Al Jazeera (4 Feb) – vox-pop + context, factual but anecdotal, weak predictive value.  
8. London Economic (26 Jan) – early bookmakers’ odds; odds are market opinion, moderate signal.  
9. iNews (3 Feb) – Vince Cable call for tactical voting; factual about statement, opinion re effect.  
10. Express/Prospect/Yahoo/Telegraph/ITV – minor candidate or party-mechanics pieces, factual, very weak on outcome.

B. Evidence weighting
Strong
• 2024 result: Labour 50.8 %, 13 413 maj (structural, official).  
• National polling: Labour government <20 % approval, repeated by multiple pollsters.  
Moderate
• Three independent MRPs (Reform 32/Lab 23; Reform 32/Lab 26; Lab 35/Reform 28).  
• Previous by-election (Runcorn & Helsby 2025) – Reform overturned larger Labour majority.  
• Reported Reform field force (hundreds canvassing daily) from two local media outlets.  
• Workers Party and Your Party standing aside – leaves Greens as only left alternative.
Weak
• Bookmakers making Greens favourite (odds move easily on small stakes).  
• Anecdotal street interviews; Guardian columnist’s four “lessons”.  
• Early row about Labour Airbnb spend in Caerphilly (specific but not clearly causal here).

C. Timeframe
20 days to the vote.  UK by-elections seldom see >5-point late swings once nominations close.  If the horizon were halved (10 days), uncertainty would shrink slightly (±2 pp changes).  If doubled (40 days), greater scope for scandals or polls to crystallise; Labour risk would rise another 3-5 pp.

D. From outside- to inside-view (base: 48 / 21 / 18 / 13)
1. Seat-specific MRPs collectively show Reform edging Labour by ~4 pp on average → −6 pp Labour, +6 pp Reform.  
2. Reform organisational effort and momentum (+ previous upset) → +4 pp Reform.  
3. Goodwin is polarising; large Muslim & student bloc likely to mobilise tactically against Reform → +3 pp Labour, +2 pp Greens, −5 pp Reform.  
4. Visible progressive tactical-vote campaign (Burnham endorsement, Vince Cable plea, left parties standing down) helps the strongest anti-Reform horse, still unclear which: split effect +3 pp Labour, +3 pp Greens.  
5. “Other” parties polling ≤5 % combined; historical precedent shows they almost never win in three-way races → −7 pp Other re-allocated proportionally to main three.

Inside-view probability calibration
Labour Party…………………38  
Reform UK……………………31  
Green Party…………………25  
Other……………………………6

Checklist (abridged)
1. Options = party whose candidate tops poll on 26 Feb 2026.  
2. Outside view = 48/21/18/13.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = Labour; least = Other – plausible.  
4. Key evidence: a) 2024 13 k majority; b) MRPs show close Reform lead; c) Labour polling collapse; d) Workers/Your Party absence boosts Greens; e) Reform’s ground game.  
5. Blind-spot: late, high-profile endorsement (e.g., Corbyn tours seat for Greens) flips tactical vote solidly to Greens → would make Greens >40 %.  
6. Probabilities sum to 100, within bounds.

Probabilities: [38, 31, 25, 6]
