    "description": "Following the [2024 United Kingdom general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_general_election), Labour Party leader Keir Starmer became Prime Minister. During his tenure, he has faced [dramatic declines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_next_United_Kingdom_general_election) in both party and personal polling, reaching unprecedented levels of personal unpopularity and seeing the Labour Party fall below 20% support.\n\nAs Starmer's popularity has declined, speculation has emerged that he may face a challenge for the Labour leadership and be ousted as Prime Minister. Mayor of Greater Manchester [Andy Burnham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Burnham) has often been considered one of the top contenders to challenge Starmer, being strongly approved of by Manchester residents and one of the very few British politicians with a positive national approval rating.\n\nDue to not holding a seat in the House of Commons, Andy Burnham would need to win a by-election before he could become Prime Minister. On January 22, 2026, and following months of speculation, Andrew Gwynne, Labour MP for Gorton and Denton [announced his resignation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c14rrez0mr4o). Though he cited ill health, it is generally thought that he resigned to allow Andy Burnham to run.\n\nAlthough Burnham was widely considered the strongest Labour candidate for the seat, the Starmer-aligned National Executive Committee [blocked his Labour candidacy](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czr4e7ep468o), throwing the race into significant contention.\n\nThe election follows substantial Labour losses in recent by-elections, including to Reform in the [2025 Runcorn and Helsby by-election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Runcorn_and_Helsby_by-election) and to Plaid Cymru in the Senedd [2025 Caerphilly by-election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Caerphilly_by-election). Despite Gorton and Denton being traditionally considered a safe Labour seat, both Reform UK and the Green Party are considered [serious](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-greens-gorton-denton-byelection-b2908838.html) [contenders](https://theconversation.com/gorton-and-denton-byelection-labour-won-comfortably-in-2024-but-reform-could-benefit-from-a-split-vote-on-the-left-274672).\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41951,\"question_id\":41690}}`",
