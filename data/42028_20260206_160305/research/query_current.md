Analysis:
To gauge which party is most likely to win the 2026 Gorton and Denton by-election we need up-to-the-minute information on 1) the official list of candidates now that nominations have closed, 2) any constituency-level polling or betting odds, 3) reportage of the local campaign including visits, endorsements, controversies, and tactical-voting calls, and 4) broader commentary on how recent Labour losses and Reform/Green momentum could translate to this specific seat. Articles published after Andrew Gwynne’s 22 Jan resignation (especially in the last few days) are the most relevant.
