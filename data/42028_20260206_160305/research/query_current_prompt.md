The forecasting question is:
Which Party will win the 2026 Gorton and Denton by-election?

Question background:
Following the [2024 United Kingdom general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_general_election), Labour Party leader Keir Starmer became Prime Minister. During his tenure, he has faced [dramatic declines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_next_United_Kingdom_general_election) in both party and personal polling, reaching unprecedented levels of personal unpopularity and seeing the Labour Party fall below 20% support.

As Starmer's popularity has declined, speculation has emerged that he may face a challenge for the Labour leadership and be ousted as Prime Minister. Mayor of Greater Manchester [Andy Burnham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Burnham) has often been considered one of the top contenders to challenge Starmer, being strongly approved of by Manchester residents and one of the very few British politicians with a positive national approval rating.

Due to not holding a seat in the House of Commons, Andy Burnham would need to win a by-election before he could become Prime Minister. On January 22, 2026, and following months of speculation, Andrew Gwynne, Labour MP for Gorton and Denton [announced his resignation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c14rrez0mr4o). Though he cited ill health, it is generally thought that he resigned to allow Andy Burnham to run.

Although Burnham was widely considered the strongest Labour candidate for the seat, the Starmer-aligned National Executive Committee [blocked his Labour candidacy](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czr4e7ep468o), throwing the race into significant contention.

The election follows substantial Labour losses in recent by-elections, including to Reform in the [2025 Runcorn and Helsby by-election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Runcorn_and_Helsby_by-election) and to Plaid Cymru in the Senedd [2025 Caerphilly by-election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Caerphilly_by-election). Despite Gorton and Denton being traditionally considered a safe Labour seat, both Reform UK and the Green Party are considered [serious](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-greens-gorton-denton-byelection-b2908838.html) [contenders](https://theconversation.com/gorton-and-denton-byelection-labour-won-comfortably-in-2024-but-reform-could-benefit-from-a-split-vote-on-the-left-274672).

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write a series of search queries that will be used to find current information/news articles relevant to the question. For each query, indicate whether you wish to utilize google, google news, or AskNews to retrieve information.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search. Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For AskNews:
Your query for AskNews will be processed more naturally, so feel free to write a sentence-long query in natural language. Avoid using ambiguous acronyms. Specify relevant criteria (e.g., geography, industry, time period) to ensure the correct scope. If desired, you can indicate multiple kinds of news articles you're looking for in your query. Keep your query to a maximum of two sentences. Important note: Do not prefix your query with 'AskNews:' or something similar. Please add the word 'AskNews' enclosed in brackets at the end of the query, referring closely to the example below.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () (NOT curly brackets, NOT square brackets [], you need to use normal brackets ()) **on the same line as and after** the query, applicable for Google, Google News and AskNews. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for AskNews.

Use the following verification checklist:
1. One query for google?
2. One query for google news?
3. One query for AskNews?
4. All queries followed by either (Google), (Google News) or (AskNews) in brackets () on the same line as the query?
