Analysis:
Gorton & Denton was created for the 2024 general election from most of the old Manchester-Gorton seat (Labour since 1935) plus Denton (also long-Labour).  In July 2024 Labour’s Andrew Gwynne won with 57 % of the vote and a 25-point margin over Reform UK, but that was before the sharp 2025-26 collapse in Labour support and Starmer’s personal ratings.  
Recent by-elections give an outside-view benchmark: the governing Labour Party has lost three of the last five contests, including a 24-point swing to Reform in Runcorn & Helsby (Jan 2025) and a 21-point swing to Plaid in Caerphilly (Oct 2025).  Average anti-Labour swing in those races is about 20 pp even when Labour holds on.  
Reform has polled particularly well in white working-class, Leave-voting areas; the eastern half of the seat (Denton & Audenshaw) fits that profile, while the old Manchester-Gorton wards are younger, ethnically diverse (≈25 % Muslim) and have shown rising Green support since the Gaza war.  
The NEC’s refusal to let popular mayor Andy Burnham stand for Labour has angered many local members, raising the risk of defections or tactical voting.  A low-profile Labour candidate now faces:  
• Robert Lumb (Reform UK), who finished second in 2024;  
• Amna Khan (Green), a Manchester councillor active on Gaza issues;  
• Possible independent run by Burnham or another “local Labour” figure (would resolve as “Other”).  
No publicly released seat poll exists yet, so historical seat results (2024) plus recent by-election swings and national polling are the main quantitative anchors.
