The forecasting question is:
Which Party will win the 2026 Gorton and Denton by-election?

The options are:
['Labour Party', 'Reform UK', 'Green Party', 'Other']

Question background:
Following the [2024 United Kingdom general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_general_election), Labour Party leader Keir Starmer became Prime Minister. During his tenure, he has faced [dramatic declines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_for_the_next_United_Kingdom_general_election) in both party and personal polling, reaching unprecedented levels of personal unpopularity and seeing the Labour Party fall below 20% support.

As Starmer's popularity has declined, speculation has emerged that he may face a challenge for the Labour leadership and be ousted as Prime Minister. Mayor of Greater Manchester [Andy Burnham](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andy_Burnham) has often been considered one of the top contenders to challenge Starmer, being strongly approved of by Manchester residents and one of the very few British politicians with a positive national approval rating.

Due to not holding a seat in the House of Commons, Andy Burnham would need to win a by-election before he could become Prime Minister. On January 22, 2026, and following months of speculation, Andrew Gwynne, Labour MP for Gorton and Denton [announced his resignation](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c14rrez0mr4o). Though he cited ill health, it is generally thought that he resigned to allow Andy Burnham to run.

Although Burnham was widely considered the strongest Labour candidate for the seat, the Starmer-aligned National Executive Committee [blocked his Labour candidacy](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/czr4e7ep468o), throwing the race into significant contention.

The election follows substantial Labour losses in recent by-elections, including to Reform in the [2025 Runcorn and Helsby by-election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Runcorn_and_Helsby_by-election) and to Plaid Cymru in the Senedd [2025 Caerphilly by-election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_Caerphilly_by-election). Despite Gorton and Denton being traditionally considered a safe Labour seat, both Reform UK and the Green Party are considered [serious](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/labour-greens-gorton-denton-byelection-b2908838.html) [contenders](https://theconversation.com/gorton-and-denton-byelection-labour-won-comfortably-in-2024-but-reform-could-benefit-from-a-split-vote-on-the-left-274672).

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-06. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-06 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model equipped with capable web crawlers and designed to generate lengthy, detailed responses. As such, you may use a longer query with detailed instructions. It is possible to ask multiple questions.
Nonetheless, you are advised to keep your query to at most four sentences.
If you are also including a Google Trends query, do not ask the agent to search for Google Trends data, trend statistics, or historical search interest values — that data is being retrieved separately. Instead, direct the agent to focus on news events, scheduled catalysts, and contextual factors.

For Google Trends:
If the question is about Google Trends data for a specific search term, use this source to retrieve actual historical data and base rate statistics. Your query should be the search term itself (e.g., "hospital" or "luigi mangione"). This will return 90-day historical data with computed statistics about typical volatility, which is critical for establishing base rates.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic indicators, financial data, interest rates, employment, GDP, inflation, trade statistics, or any quantitative economic metric, use FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) to retrieve official historical data. Your query should describe the economic indicator (e.g., "US unemployment rate" or "consumer price index") or use a known FRED series ID directly (e.g., "UNRATE" or "CPIAUCSL"). This returns historical data with computed statistics for establishing base rates.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () **on the same line as and after** the query. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for Agent. Add a Google Trends query if the question involves Google Trends data. Add a FRED query if the question involves economic/financial data.
