Manchester Evening News**\nOn February 5, 2026, Nigel Farage and Matt Goodwin officially launched Reform UK's campaign in Gorton and Denton, opening a local party office ahead of the by-election on February 26, triggered by Andrew Gwynne\u2019s resignation. Goodwin, Reform UK\u2019s candidate, emphasized that the campaign focuses on local issues such as Labour neglect, cost of living, high business rates, VAT, energy bills, anti-social behaviour, and knife crime, arguing that national narratives about race and immigration misrepresent the real concerns of voters. He cited conversations with residents across Burnage, Gorton, and Longsight, noting that people from minority backgrounds share concerns about integration, uncontrolled immigration, and economic hardship. Goodwin criticized Labour for complacency and contempt, referencing a leaked WhatsApp group where former MP Gwynne and councillors mocked vulnerable voters and pensioners. Farage responded to a Guardian journalist\u2019s question about a canvasser who joined Reform to 'stop people taking over the country' by affirming that Reform UK includes Muslim, Christian, and Jewish supporters and has diverse donors and candidates. He stressed that the by-election is a national statement against Prime Minister Keir Starmer, whom he called the most unpopular PM in living memory. Goodwin highlighted Reform UK\u2019s strong ground game, with hundreds of activists canvassing daily, contrasting it with minimal Labour and Green activity. He called for a mature national conversation on integration and belonging, referencing Ed Husain\u2019s findings on segregated Muslim communities, while reaffirming that the campaign is fundamentally about local priorities\u2014such as failing infrastructure, rising rents, and struggling small businesses\u2014rather than divisive identity politics. Both leaders rejected media framing of the race as a cultural conflict, insisting the campaign unites people across backgrounds who care about economic fairness, community safety, and accountability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 10:08 PM\nSource:[Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/every-word-said-nigel-farage-33373013)\n\n**'We're not racists, we've not got two heads... we just want change'  - Manchester Evening News**\nReform UK officially launched its campaign in the Gorton and Denton constituency on February 5, 2026, amid cold, rainy weather. The event took place at an industrial building in Denton, described as resembling a warehouse, with a large Union Flag and Reform slogans displayed. Party leader Nigel Farage and candidate Matt Goodwin attended, cutting a blue ribbon to mark the launch. Supporters, including local resident Zack Dale, 18, and attendees like Hayley Atkins, 75, and Martin Sykes, 65, expressed support for Reform\u2019s platform, emphasizing a desire for change, tougher crime policies, and concerns over immigration, cost of living, and housing. Dale reported facing abuse for his activism, while Sykes stated, 'We're not racists, we've not got two heads, we just want change.' Farage declared that winning the by-election would be 'the final nail in the coffin for Keir Starmer,' and both leaders praised the turnout and dedication of supporters. Despite optimism, Reform acknowledged the race remains highly contested, with three weeks until polling day on February 26.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 08:19 PM\nSource:[Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/were-not-racists-weve-not-33372482)\n\n**LIVE: Nigel Farage back in Greater Manchester amid Gorton and Denton by-election**\nNigel Farage is campaigning in Greater Manchester ahead of the Gorton and Denton by-election, supporting Reform UK candidate Matt Goodwin. Farage visited the constituency on February 2, 2026, and returned on February 5, 2026, to further the campaign. Goodwin, a GB News presenter and former university academic, was officially announced as Reform UK\u2019s candidate on January 27, 2026, during a press conference in the constituency. He described the by-election as a 'referendum on Keir Starmer' and emphasized he is 'not a career politician,' citing his history of delivering pizzas in the area 30 years ago while studying at the University of Salford. The Labour Party rejected Andy Burnham\u2019s bid to stand in the constituency, and a total of eleven candidates are running for the seat.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 01:57 PM\nSource:[Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/live-nigel-farage-gorton-denton-33369103)\n\n**Who is standing in the Gorton and Denton by-election?**\nA by-election is scheduled for 26 February 2026 in the Gorton and Denton constituency in Greater Manchester, triggered by the resignation of former MP Andrew Gwynne on medical grounds. The article confirms that the election will feature a full list of candidates, though no specific names are provided in the text. The event is part of the ongoing political developments in the UK, with live updates available through Sky News.

This move, which shocked many given her past condemnation of Tories as 'scum,' marked a pivotal moment in Starmer\u2019s political vulnerability, forcing him into a humiliating U-turn and damaging his reputation for integrity. The article draws parallels to past political knife-wielding figures like Michael Heseltine, Michael Gove, and Rishi Sunak, who destabilized leaders but did not ultimately claim the crown. Rayner, who resigned less than six months prior over a personal tax error involving stamp duty on her Brighton flat, had remained largely silent on the backbenches, avoiding direct criticism of the government. However, her strategic Commons vote signaled a clear intent to position herself as a potential successor to Starmer. With Andy Burnham out of contention and Wes Streeting seen as too right-leaning and closely associated with Mandelson, Rayner is now viewed as a strong contender. The article questions whether her intervention was a calculated move at the perfect moment or an overreach that could backfire, especially as Labour faces low approval ratings, a weak personal standing for Starmer, and a crucial by-election in Gorton and Denton looming on February 26, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 07:02 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/angela-rayner-keir-starmer-mandelson-morgan-mcsweeney-b2914060.html)\n\n**Could Labour lose Gorton and Denton? Here's what the polls say**\nThe upcoming by-election in Gorton and Denton, Greater Manchester, scheduled for 26 February 2026, is poised to be one of Labour's most significant challenges yet. Labour, defending a seat it has held since 1979 with a 13,413 majority in 2024 (50.8% of the vote), faces a tightening race against Reform and the Greens. Polling data reveals a shift in momentum: Electoral Calculus and Britain Predicts place Reform ahead of Labour (32% vs. 22.6% and 32% vs. 26%, respectively), while Polling Report predicts Labour holding with 35.26% to Reform\u2019s 27.65%. The Greens, though not leading in current polls, are expected to benefit from tactical voting, especially given Labour\u2019s declining national popularity and a 16.4-point drop in vote share from 2019 (67.2% to 50.8%). In 2024, Reform gained 14.1% (up 9.2 points) and the Greens 13.2% (up 10.7 points), with turnout dropping from 61.7% to 46.8%. Labour\u2019s candidate is Manchester city councillor Angeliki Stogia; Reform has selected GB News presenter Matt Goodwin; and the Greens have nominated plumber and local councillor Hannah Spencer. The constituency, restructured as Gorton and Denton in 2024 from Denton and Reddish, has been represented by two Labour MPs\u2014Andrew Bennett and Andrew Gwynne\u2014since 1983. The current polling indicates Labour\u2019s struggle to maintain dominance amid rising support for Reform and a growing Green presence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 03:27 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/gorton-denton-by-election-polls-labour-reform-greens-b2913017.html)\n\n**Jeremy Corbyn's new party in chaos as civil war with Zarah Sultana explodes**\nJeremy Corbyn's new left-wing party, Your Party, has descended into further chaos following a public rift with MP Zarah Sultana. The conflict intensified after Your Party failed to select a candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election on February 26, 2026. In an official statement, the party said: 'After consultation with local members, we do not believe that a Your Party candidacy would serve our collective goals in this by-election.' In response, Sultana stated she would support the Green candidate, asserting that this decision was made solely because Your Party had no candidate. The breakdown in relations follows earlier expectations that Corbyn and Sultana would co-lead the party, marking a significant escalation in internal discord.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 11:57 AM\nSource:[EXPRESS](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/2166634/jeremy-corbyns-new-party-chaos)\n\n**Gorton and Denton by-election candidates confirmed with 11 in the race - full list - Manchester Evening News**\nThe Gorton and Denton by-election in the Manchester and Tameside constituency will be held on Thursday, February 26, 2026, following the resignation of MP Andrew Gwynne on January 22, 2026.

The seat, long considered a Labour stronghold, is now contested by 11 candidates, including representatives from the Conservative Party, Liberal Democrats, Green Party, Reform UK, Libertarian Party, Social Democratic Party, Rejoin EU Party, Communist League, and the Official Monster Raving Loony Party. The contest intensified after the Labour Party leadership blocked Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham\u2019s candidacy, instead selecting Angeliki Stogia, a local councillor, as the official candidate. While some residents, like Khaled Osman, remain supportive of Labour for its refugee and asylum policies, others, such as Colin Hensey, criticize the party for deteriorating local services, citing long waits for doctor appointments and rising reliance on A&E. The Green Party positions itself as a progressive alternative, accusing Labour of abandoning its original values. Reform UK campaigns as an anti-establishment force, emphasizing tough stances on immigration and crime, with supporter Carl Morris stating, 'Labour's done nothing for this town.' Al Jazeera reporter Sonia Gallego noted that every vote will be crucial in a tightly contested race, reflecting a broader struggle over who will channel local frustrations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 10:48 AM\nSource:[Al Jazeera Online](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/4/gorton-and-denton-by-election-tests-labours-grip-on-heartland-voters)\n\n**Zack Polanski's missed opportunity**\nThe upcoming parliamentary byelection in the Greater Manchester constituency of Gorton and Denton is notable not for what is happening, but for what is not: the absence of Zack Polanski, leader of the Green Party, as the party\u2019s candidate. Instead, the Greens are fielding 34-year-old Hannah Spencer, a plumber and Trafford council leader. Polanski\u2019s absence is significant given the constituency\u2019s young, ethnically diverse electorate, which could be fertile ground for the Greens. At the last election, Labour won half the vote, with Reform UK and the Greens closely competing for second place. Polanski\u2019s candidacy could have disrupted Labour\u2019s narrative of a two-horse race and potentially made him a national political figure, akin to Nigel Farage. His decision not to run may stem from underestimating the importance of parliamentary representation for national influence or a belief he could not win. The absence benefits Labour, potentially securing a victory that would bolster Keir Starmer\u2019s position and delay Polanski\u2019s rise as a left-wing populist. A Green victory without Polanski would still boost the party but leave its leader outside Parliament, raising questions about future runs. A Reform UK win could be existential for the Conservative Party, potentially triggering further defections by breaking through into metropolitan areas. Conversely, a Reform loss would reinforce the perception of a 'glass ceiling' limiting Reform outside white working-class constituencies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 10:23 AM\nSource:[Prospect Magazine](https://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/politics/the-insider/72313/zack-polanskis-missed-opportunity-gorton-and-denton-byelection)\n\n**Operation stop Farage: New tactical voting plan for Starmer's critical by-election**\nSir Vince Cable, former Liberal Democrat leader, has urged progressive voters in the Gorton and Denton by-election\u2014scheduled for 26 February 2026\u2014to support Labour tactically to prevent the Reform Party from winning, marking a significant departure from the party\u2019s usual stance. According to Cable, the Liberal Democrats are not expected to win the seat, and with Reform Party gaining national momentum, he described the challenge as 'existential.' He emphasized that progressive voters have a 'duty' to act politically responsibly, noting that while the Lib Dems have historically benefited from tactical voting, they must now support Labour as the main force opposing Reform. Polling and bookmakers indicate a three-way race between Labour, Reform, and the Green Party, with Labour having secured over 50% of the vote in the 2024 general election in this constituency. Cable acknowledged the political risk of aligning with an unpopular Labour government but argued that the rise of the extreme right is the dominant issue of the age. A Liberal Democrat spokesman stated that Cable is entitled to his view but affirmed the party\u2019s commitment to standing its own candidate and campaigning for every vote. Reform\u2019s candidate, Matt Goodwin, warned that a Labour defeat could force Prime Minister Keir Starmer to resign.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 06:00 AM\nSource:[inews.co.uk](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/operation-stop-farage-tactical-voting-starmer-by-election-4208679)\n\n**Reform criticises Tory candidate who fundraised for pro-migrant charity**\nCharlotte Cadden, the Conservative Party's candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election, is at the center of a political controversy due to her fundraising efforts for the LGBT Foundation, a Manchester-based charity.

The decision to exclude Burnham, made by the Labour Party, has intensified Labour's campaign to position itself as the only force capable of preventing Reform UK from winning the constituency. Burnham campaigned alongside Stogia and Labour deputy leader Lucy Powell, emphasizing unity and partnership as core values. In a post on X, Powell stated that Burnham was clear: 'we are united against the division of Reform' and urged voters to support Labour to keep Reform out of Manchester. Labour North West shared a video of Burnham and Stogia knocking on doors. However, the exclusion of Burnham may have benefited Reform and the Greens, especially after the Workers Party stood down, allowing the Greens' candidate, Hannah Spencer, to become the odds-on favorite.

Labour\u2019s Andy Burnham was blocked from standing by the Party\u2019s National Executive Committee (NEC) under a rule preventing mayors from triggering costly by-elections. Cadden emphasized key issues including local schools, the NHS, and policing, stating her campaign aims to remove mobile phones from schools and abolish the carbon tax. She also claimed that 'social justice theories' have infiltrated public services, threatening the safety of women and girls.

The by-election, scheduled for February 26, 2026, was triggered by the resignation of MP Andrew Gwynne, who cited medical advice urging him not to return to work as an MP and requested privacy for recovery. Gwynne\u2019s resignation followed his involvement in the 'Trigger Me Timbers' WhatsApp scandal, which was reported nearly a year earlier. Former Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham sought to stand but was blocked by the Labour Party\u2019s ten-member National Executive Committee (NEC), which enforced a rule preventing mayors from triggering costly by-elections. The Green Party, Liberal Democrats, and Reform Party have already confirmed their candidates for the constituency.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 11:35 AM\nSource:[Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/live-labour-gorton-denton-candidate-33338138)\n\n**Confirmed list of Gorton and Denton by-election candidates so far**\nA by-election for the Gorton and Denton constituency in Manchester is scheduled for Thursday, 26 February 2026, following the retirement of former Labour MP Andrew Gwynne on medical grounds. Gwynne, who won the seat in the July 2024 general election with 50.8% of the vote and a majority of over 13,000, was suspended from the Labour Party in 2025 after reports of offensive WhatsApp messages. Candidates have until 5pm on Friday, 30 January 2026, to declare their intention to run. The confirmed candidates are: Matt Goodwin (Reform UK), who described the by-election as a 'referendum on Keir Starmer' and emphasized his non-establishment stance; Sebastian Moore (Social Democratic Party), the SDP North West Chair, who pledged to improve housing and community cohesion; Jackie Pearcey (Liberal Democrats), a local campaigner and regional Lib Dems president, who criticized both Labour and Reform UK and highlighted issues like the cost of living and NHS reform; and Hannah Spencer (Green Party), a Trafford Councillor and former mayoral candidate, who pledged to focus on ending 'Britain's enabling of Israel's genocide' and criticized Reform UK as extreme and financially backed. In the 2024 general election, Reform UK received 14.1%, the Green Party 13.2%, and the Liberal Democrats 3.8% of the vote in the constituency.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 01:45 PM\nSource:[ITV Hub](https://www.itv.com/news/granada/2026-01-30/confirmed-list-of-gorton-and-denton-by-election-candidates-so-far)\n\n**Reform's choice in Gorton and Denton tells you everything you need to know**\nThe by-election in Gorton and Denton, a former safe Labour seat in Greater Manchester, reflects broader political shifts in the UK. The Green Party positions itself as the leading contender, citing growing public support and a movement for real change, with bold plans to reduce bills, rebuild public services, and improve lives. In contrast, Labour is portrayed as ineffective and distracted, focusing on minor issues like a leaflet typo rather than addressing voters' concerns. The Green Party also frames Reform UK as a divisive force funded by fossil fuel interests, linked to Russia, and aligned with Trump and Viktor Orb\u00e1n. The selection of Matthew Goodwin as Reform\u2019s candidate intensifies this narrative, with the Green Party condemning him as a dangerous extremist who promotes racial division, denies British identity to immigrants, and glorifies violence against asylum seekers. Despite Reform\u2019s financial advantages and online misinformation campaigns, the Green Party emphasizes 'people power'\u2014a grassroots movement of diverse, passionate supporters\u2014arguing this will defeat hate-driven politics. The outcome is seen as pivotal: a Green victory would signal a shift toward unity and hope, while a Reform win would represent a dangerous embrace of division and extremism.

A hustings event will take place on Saturday, January 31, 2026, with the winner set to contest the February 26, 2026, by-election. Other confirmed candidates include Matt Goodwin (Reform), Shahbaz Sarwar (Workers Party), and Melissa Poulton (Greens). The by-election was triggered by Andrew Gwynne's resignation on January 22, 2026, following the 'Trigger Me Timbers' WhatsApp group scandal, and the Labour National Executive Committee blocked Andy Burnham\u2019s candidacy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 04:27 PM\nSource:[Manchester Evening News](https://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/greater-manchester-news/labour-down-last-two-candidates-33320105)\n\n**LIVE: Lee Anderson Unveils Gorton and Denton By-Election Candidate**\nReform Party leader Lee Anderson announced the party's candidate for the Gorton and Denton by-election on January 27, 2026, during a live event in the constituency.

Starmer emphasized that Burnham\u2019s focus should remain on his mayoral duties, stating that an unnecessary mayoral election would divert money and personnel from higher-priority contests. Burnham expressed disappointment, criticized the premature media leak of the decision, and accused the party of undervaluing long-serving members, saying, 'You would think that over 30 years of service would count for something but sadly not.' Over 50 Labour MPs reportedly signed a letter opposing the decision, with figures like Clive Lewis calling it a 'serious political and democratic error' and urging expansion of democratic choice. Conor Naismith argued that the principle of local decision-making should prevail. In contrast, MPs David Taylor and Phil Brickell urged unity and a focus on winning the by-election and tackling the cost of living. Union voices were divided: Unison\u2019s Andrea Egan and TSSA criticized the decision as undemocratic and politically motivated, with TSSA alleging 'factional reasons' behind the blocking, while Usdaw accepted the NEC\u2019s decision, praising Burnham\u2019s record and calling for party unity. The Labour Party maintained that the decision was in the party\u2019s best interest to avoid disproportionate resource use and to safeguard Greater Manchester\u2019s Labour control.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 04:14 PM\nSource:[labourlist.org](https://labourlist.org/2026/01/keir-starmer-andy-burnham-nec-ruling/)\n\n**Bookies make Green Party surprise FAVOURITES to win Gorton and Denton by-election**\nBookmakers have named the Green Party as the early favourites to win the Gorton and Denton by-election in January 2026, with odds of 6/4 offered by Coral, Ladbrokes, and StarSports. Reform Party is second favourite at 13/8, while Labour is third at 2/1 despite Andrew Gwynne previously holding the seat. The Labour Party's internal turmoil, including Andy Burnham being blocked by the NEC from running, has created a vacuum in the left-wing vote. The Conservatives are heavily unfavoured at 200/1, and George Galloway\u2019s Workers Party of Britain is listed at 33/1. Green Party leader Zack Polanski expressed optimism about the odds, stating the party is best positioned to counter Reform\u2019s challenge, emphasizing the need to understand local voter behaviour. Odds are subject to change based on confirmed candidates. The race is expected to be highly competitive due to a fragmented left vote and potential high-profile Reform candidates like Zia Yusuf (unconfirmed) or Simon Danczuk.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 12:14 AM\nSource:[The London Economic](https://www.thelondoneconomic.com/politics/betting-odds-gorton-and-denton-by-election-2026-green-party-reform-402667/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
