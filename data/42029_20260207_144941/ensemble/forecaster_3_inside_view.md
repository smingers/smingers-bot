Highest **daily “High” price** for **silver futures (SI=F) on Yahoo Finance** during **April 1–30, 2026**, in **USD per troy ounce**.

## (a) Source analysis (facts vs opinions; quality; date)

### BullionVault infographic (AI forecasts for April 2026; plus user averages) — *mixed/low-to-moderate quality for forecasting*
- **Facts:** Reports BullionVault-user *average* prices for Dec 2025 ($64.34), Jan 2026 ($92.13), Feb 2026 ($84.74*).
- **Opinions/forecasts:** AI model ranges for **April 2026** centered around **$47–$57**.
- **Assessment:** These AI ranges appear **incoherent with current realized price regime** (silver recently ~$70–$120). Useful as a sentiment datapoint (models expecting reversion), but I weight the AI forecast levels **lightly**.

### Yahoo Finance (Jan 27, 2026) “startling forecasts” — *moderate quality for narrative + some facts*
- **Facts:** Mentions extreme turnover in SLV; performance stats; China export licensing framing.
- **Opinions:** Notes warnings by identifiable market figures (Kolanovic, Brandt) but via journalistic summary.
- **Assessment:** Good for **documenting speculative conditions** and potential policy driver (China export controls), but the “meme” framing is partly interpretive.

### GoldSilver.com “predictions 2026” — *low-to-moderate quality; promotional bias*
- **Facts:** Claims about deficits, inventories, solar share (hard to verify from the excerpt alone).
- **Opinions:** A named analyst (“Alan Hibbard”) suggests **$175+** possible.
- **Assessment:** Directionally plausible drivers, but **very bullish** and from a dealer ecosystem; I treat the price target as **weak evidence**.

### Business Insider (Jan 28, 2026) Kolanovic/Brandt bearish — *moderate quality*
- **Facts:** Documents who said what; contextualizes historical analog (2011-like blow-off).
- **Opinions:** Kolanovic: “almost guaranteed” ~50% drop within a year; Brandt warnings.
- **Assessment:** Useful as **credible caution** on post-blowoff dynamics, but timing (“within a year”) is not directly about **April** highs.

### Economic Times on drop (late Jan/early Feb 2026) — *moderate quality for market color; some named quotes*
- **Facts:** Notes sharp declines; mentions dollar strength; geopolitical easing; margin/positioning effects.
- **Opinions:** Named analysts comment on industrial demand fading at high prices (e.g., substitution attempts).
- **Assessment:** I weight **the mechanism (demand destruction/substitution at high prices)** as meaningful, though exact magnitudes are uncertain.

### Yahoo Finance (Feb 4, 2026) rebound / “buy the dip” — *low-to-moderate quality*
- **Facts:** Rebound occurred; gold around $4,900; silver bouncing.
- **Opinions:** “Analysts bullish” but largely **unnamed**.
- **Assessment:** Confirms **whipsaw volatility**, but limited attributable insight.

### AP futures table (Feb 6, 2026) — *high quality for market-implied levels*
- **Facts:** Settlement prices across maturities; Feb 2026 silver settled about **$76.735**; forward prices rise into the 80s in later maturities.
- **Assessment:** A strong anchor for **where the futures curve is pricing** (market consensus baseline).

### AskNews items (Feb 3–6, 2026; Reuters-like market reports + local business press)
- **Facts (moderate-to-high):** Multiple reports of silver swinging from ~$70s to ~$90s and even prints above $100 on some sessions; mentions margin hikes/forced liquidation dynamics; identifies support/resistance levels (some are local-market technical commentary).
- **Assessment:** Best used to characterize **current volatility regime** and **post-crash reflex rallies**; exact “high” values vary by contract/venue, so I don’t overfit to any single print.

## (b) Evidence / factor weighting (using your scheme)

### Strong evidence (large shifts)
1. **Current regime = extreme volatility + leverage/margin dynamics** (multiple independent reports: big down days and sharp rebounds).  
   *Implication:* April’s **maximum daily high** has meaningful upside tail even if the month averages lower.
2. **Futures curve anchor (AP)** around mid/high $70s nearby, rising into $80s further out.  
   *Implication:* Market baseline for spring is **not** a return to $40–$50; also not pricing sustained $110+.

### Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
1. **Post-blowoff correction analogs and credible bearish voices (Kolanovic/Brandt)**.  
   *Implication:* Caps the probability of **retesting January ATH** quickly; raises odds April high is under ~$115–$120.
2. **Industrial demand sensitivity / substitution talk at very high prices** (Economic Times named quote).  
   *Implication:* Makes a fast return to $120+ harder unless it’s mostly speculative/financial demand.

### Weak evidence (small shifts)
1. **Dealer/marketing-site super-bull targets (e.g., $175+)**.  
2. **AI model point forecasts at $47–$57** (BullionVault infographic).  
   *Implication:* These are informative as “reversion narratives exist,” but inconsistent with present conditions; I don’t let them drive the distribution.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time left:** From **Feb 7, 2026** to **Apr 30, 2026** is ~**82 days**.
- Because the question is the **highest daily high in April**, the outcome depends on (i) the general level by April and (ii) the chance of at least one **spike day**.

**If timeframe were halved (to March 2026 instead of April):** less time for stabilization and new catalysts; I’d shift the distribution **slightly lower** (especially P60–P90).  
**If timeframe were doubled (to June 2026):** more time for macro catalysts (policy/geopolitics) and for a renewed speculative cycle; I’d widen tails and shift **P80–P90 somewhat higher**, while also allowing a bit more downside if the unwind persists.

## (d) Justification: updating from the outside view base rate to an inside-view forecast

### Outside view baseline (given)
You provided an outside-view distribution centered on **April highs in the high-$80s**, with a **P90 around $107**.

### Why I shift the distribution (net: slightly higher and wider upper tail)
1. **This is a “maximum-in-month” question in a fat-tailed volatility regime.**  
   Even if the market “should” be ~$75–$90, the probability of at least one outsized rally day in a 20-trading-day month is non-trivial.
2. **Market baseline remains elevated (AP futures curve near ~$77 nearby).**  
   That reduces the plausibility of the April *maximum* being only in the $50s unless another liquidation wave hits.
3. **But the January blow-off and subsequent crash plausibly suppress a fast retest of $121+.**  
   Deleveraging, higher margins, and “burned” speculative participants tend to dampen repeat spikes—though not eliminate them.

**Net effect:** I keep the center near the **mid/high $80s**, but I make:
- the **lower tail** a bit lower (another liquidation to the $60s could still happen), and
- the **upper tail** a bit higher than the original outside view (because “max-of-month” + current whipsaw makes a $105–$120 print plausible).

## Quick checklist (quality control)
1. **Criteria match:** Highest Yahoo SI=F **daily High** during **April 2026**, USD/oz.  
2. **Outside view acknowledged:** Prior baseline P10–P90 ≈ **$63–$107**.  
3. **Consistency:** Implied median ≈ geometric mean of P40/P60 = sqrt(80×92) ≈ **$86**; implied mean slightly higher (~$90–$95) due to right-skew. Reasonable vs futures baseline ~$77 and volatility.  
4. **Top evidence (3–5 items):**
   - AP futures curve anchors spring levels around **upper $70s/low $80s**.
   - Multiple independent reports of **huge daily swings** (crash + sharp rebounds).
   - Credible warnings (Kolanovic/Brandt) consistent with **post-blowoff hangover**.
   - Evidence of **demand resistance/substitution** at very high prices.
5. **Blind spot:** A renewed geopolitical/monetary shock plus thin liquidity could trigger another squeeze and make **$125+** in April more likely than I’m pricing (pushes outcome **up**).
