--------------------------------------------------------------------
2. EVIDENCE WEIGHTING

Strong   – Exchange settlement data show current level mid-70s (A, C)  
   – Historical pattern: post-parabolic silver tops (1980, 2011) did not retake high inside 3 mo.  
Moderate   – Margin hikes & forced deleveraging (B, F) depress near-term upside.  
   – Named bearish experts (D) expecting large retracement.  
   – Structural deficit / industrial demand narrative (A, E) supports rebounds.  
Weak   – AI/retail forecasts clustering 40-70 (background) – methodology opaque.  
   – Sponsored mining-company pieces (E).

Net: Strong evidence caps probability of a new record in April but moderate evidence keeps fat upside tail.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
3. TIMEFRAME ANALYSIS

Forecast horizon: ~83 days until April ends.  
Halved (≈6 weeks): little time for positioning to reset – lowers upside tail.  
Doubled (≈23 weeks): mine supply/ Fed cuts / geopolitics could re-ignite squeeze – raises upside tail.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
4. JUSTIFICATION / OUTSIDE→INSIDE VIEW

Outside-view base rate (post-blow-off commodity):  
• Median “highest-in-third-month” ≈ 65-80 % of prior peak.  
  With January peak 121 → base-rate median ≈ 85–95.

Adjustments  
+ Ongoing macro tension & supply deficit keep FOMO alive.  
– Recent 40 % drawdown, high margins, waning retail leverage likely inhibit full re-spike.  
– Term structure (C) tops out below 85 through July, signalling professional caution.

Resulting distribution centred just below 100 with fat right tail but meaningful chance of further wash-out.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
5. FORECASTING CHECKLIST (abbrev.)

• Implied median ≈ 92; mean ≈ 97 – consistent with fat-right-tailed, high-vol market.  
• Key evidence: (1) Current price ~75, (2) prior ATH 121 only 1 ½ mo earlier, (3) 1980/2011 analogues show lower-high pattern, (4) elevated margins/position clean-up, (5) still-bullish macro narrative.  
• Blind-spot: Sudden geopolitical shock (e.g. major Gulf escalation) reignites safe-haven rush – could push April high well above 140.
