Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. JM Bullion 1-year price chronology (dated Feb 2026).  Factual daily price points; reputable bullion dealer; minimal forward-looking opinion.  
2. SilverPrice.org long-term history (undated but stops ≈ 2020).  Purely backward-looking; useful for structural context; no actionable forecasts.  
3. USAGOLD note (6 Feb 2026).  Provides current spot ($76-77), CME margin data, and a 40 % draw-down figure.  Mostly factual but coloured by a pro-bullion sales angle.  
4. IG “Commodities outlook 2026” (23 Dec 2025).  Mid-term investment bank–style note; contains specific supply-deficit numbers, technical targets $72/$88; moderate quality.  
5. Kitco headline (19 Dec 2025).  Merely sentiment poll headline; low evidentiary value.  
6. Economic Times piece (30 Jan 2026).  Current prices and AI-gold forecast; silver comments ancillary; still useful for confirming Jan-29 peak at $121.78.  
7. Agent report (7 Feb 2026).  Synthesises multiple primary feeds (Yahoo Finance, TradingEconomics, CFTC, CME).  Gives coherent blow-off-top narrative and quotes specific intraday highs/lows; high analytic value though second-hand.

Across the set, the hard data points (daily highs, CME margin hikes) are strong; most explicit forward opinions come from IG and USAGOLD and should be down-weighted.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates:  
1. Post-spike behaviour of silver after prior parabolic tops (1980, 2011).  
2. Post-spike behaviour for other thin-market industrial precious metals (palladium 2020, rhodium 2019).  
3. Ordinary 3-month rolling-window silver volatility since 1970.  

Class 1 is chosen.  In both 1980 and 2011 silver lost 30-60 % within six weeks and did not revisit the peak for years.  Maxima recorded 60-90 days after the top averaged 55 % of the blow-off price.  Applying that ratio to the Jan-29-2026 high of $121.6 gives an outside-view central estimate around $67.  However, current macro background (structural deficit, $75 spot even after liquidation) argues today’s floor is higher relative to history, so I up-shift the reference class by one standard deviation (~15 %).  Adjusted base level ≈ $77.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until the last April trading day: 83.  Silver’s 30-day realised volatility (Feb 7) ≈ 60 % annualised, triple its long-term mean (≈ 20 %).  In previous spikes, realised vol decayed by roughly 50 % every two months.  If similar, March/April vol would settle near 30-35 % ann.  A random-walk with σ ≈ 30 % annualised over 3 months implies a ±15 % 1-σ band for the period high relative to its starting point.

(d) Justification  
Baseline: spot $76.5 (Feb 7 settle).  
Short-term drift: neutral to modestly positive because (i) deficit narrative intact, (ii) Fed still signalling accommodative stance, (iii) Chinese inventory lows.  
Headwinds: lingering speculative overhang, elevated margin, potential Fed hawkish appointment.  
Implied distribution: Center on $85–90 (10 % above spot), fat right tail for another momentum burst (10 % chance of >$120), moderate left tail back to $60 if wash-out resumes.  Outcomes much below $50 look remote (<3 %) given cost-curve and 5-year deficit.

Outside view calibration:

1. Treat log-returns.  Mean expected log-return to April ≈ +0.10; σ of max-over-period ≈ 0.25.  Back-transform gives a log-normal-like skew.  
2. Cross-check with IG technical targets: next resistance $88; stretch $110.  Those line up with my 60th and 80th percentiles respectively.  
3. Tail sanity: probability of printing a new all-time high (> $121.6) set at 10 %.  Probability of < $60 set at 10 %.  Those anchor the 10th and 90th markers roughly two multiplicative σ’s from the centre.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 60  
Percentile 20: 68  
Percentile 40: 78  
Percentile 60: 90  
Percentile 80: 110  
Percentile 90: 130
