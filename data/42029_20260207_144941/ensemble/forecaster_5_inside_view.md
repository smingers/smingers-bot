Forecast target (paraphrased): “Highest daily price shown for the COMEX silver front-month contract (ticker SI=F on Yahoo Finance) during the calendar month of April 2026, expressed in US dollars per troy ounce.”

================================================================
A. Source analysis (condensed: factual items vs. opinion, quality, date)

1. Yahoo Finance / AP “BC-Gold-Silver” (6 Feb 2026) – Timely futures settlement data (strong factual); no forward opinion.  
2. Economic Times, Mint, Hankyung etc. (4–6 Feb 2026) – Spot/futures prints and margin-hike details (factual, good); scattered broker quotes on support/resistance (opinions, moderate quality).  
3. Business Insider w/ Kolanovic & Brandt (28 Jan 2026) – Verifiable experts giving explicit bearish forecast (opinion, moderate–strong).  
4. Yahoo Finance “Analysts lay startling forecasts” (27 Jan 2026) – Mixed facts on volumes plus opinions; author not an industry analyst (lower weight).  
5. Economic Times “price falling 9.3 %” (early-Feb 2026) – Hard price prints, plus Kunal Shah (well-known Indian commodities strategist) on fading industrial demand (moderate weight).  
6. BullionVault AI-forecast composite (late-Jan 2026) – Retrodictive models; methodological opacity, serves as sentiment gauge only (weak).  
7. GoldSilver.com piece with Alan Hibbard (Jan 2026) – Promotional dealer site; very bullish figure of 175 $ (opinion, weak credibility).  
8. January-29 record-high reports (RIA, AVN, APA) – Hard data of the 121.6 $ top (strong factual).  
9. Historical analogues (1980, 2011 blow-offs) – Primary data from USGS and LBMA charts (strong factual).

================================================================
B. Evidence weighting

Strong evidence  
• January blow-off top at 121.6 $ followed by >35 % crash within ten days (multi-source confirmation) – historical pattern suggests mean reversion.  
• Silver’s history after prior parabolic tops (1980, 2011) – three-month highs ended 55–90 % of the peak.  
• CME/MCX margin increases and open-interest collapse – structural brake on fresh leveraged spikes.

Moderate evidence  
• Kolanovic & Brandt see 50 % draw-down in one year – pushes distribution left.  
• Persistent physical deficit, record industrial demand (Silver Institute, quoted across articles) – supports upside tail.  
• Fed expected to cut rates through 2026, geopolitical tension background – bullish macro bias.  

Weak evidence  
• Dealer articles touting 175 $ targets, AI-model averages in the 40–60 $ range.  
• Short-term rebounds of 10–12 % in early February – high-frequency noise relative to April high.

================================================================
C. Timeframe analysis

Time until first trading day of April 2026: 53 days; until month-end: 83 days.  
At the realised 100 % annualised volatility seen since January, a 2-month one-sigma band is roughly ±40 %.  
Halving the horizon to mid-March would tighten tails (less chance of another squeeze); doubling to end-June would broaden both tails and slightly raise the median (more time for either capitulation or new mania).

================================================================
D. Justification / inside-view adjustment

Base-rate (outside view): After previous blow-offs the maximum three months later has been 70 % of the spike on median. 0.70 × 121.6 $ ≈ 85 $.  

Inside-view pushes:  
+ Physical deficit, lower real rates, geopolitics → +10 $ on modal zone.  
– Fresh leverage capped by margin hikes, exhausted retail squeeze, industrial demand balking above 90 $ → −5 $ on modal zone.  
Net modal (≈ 55 th pct) around 90 $.  
Tail shape:  
• 15 % chance of taking out the January high via another squeeze (rare but possible) → right-tail to 130–140 $.  
• 10 % chance of cascading deleveraging & strong dollar sending prices below 60 $.  

Resulting subjective distribution (checked for monotonicity and plausible mean ≈ 95 $):

P10 ≈ 55 $  
P20 ≈ 65 $  
P40 ≈ 78 $  
P60 ≈ 92 $  
P80 ≈ 115 $  
P90 ≈ 135 $

================================================================
E. Quick forecasting checklist

1. Target variable restated – done above.  
2. Base rate = 0.7 × blow-off top ≈ 85 $.  
3. Consistency: median ≈ 85–90 $, mean ≈ 95 $; matches narrative and volatility maths.  
4. Key evidence (≤ 20 words each):  
   – Jan-29 ATH 121.6 $ then 40 % crash.  
   – Historical post-spike patterns (1980, 2011).  
   – CME margin hikes, OI down 25 %.  
   – Record industrial demand yet price-sensitive Chinese PV cutbacks.  
5. Blind-spot: Major geopolitical shock (e.g., Taiwan crisis) triggers flight-to-safety squeeze above 150 $ – would make forecast too low.
