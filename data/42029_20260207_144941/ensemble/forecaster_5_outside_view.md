Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. JM Bullion 1-year price chronology (Apr 2024-Feb 2025, factual) – good primary data; modest editorial bias.  
2. SilverPrice.org long-term history (up to ~2020, factual) – reliable for big-picture base rates but dated for current cycle.  
3. USAGOLD note dated 6 Feb 2026 (spot $76.4, CME margin hikes) – timely, specific, cites CME figures; opinion that weakness is “transitory” is author’s view.  
4. IG commodities outlook, 23 Dec 2025 – synthesises bank research; credible for structural-deficit narrative and technical targets.  
5. Kitco headline on retail sentiment, 19 Dec 2025 – sentiment indicator only; low weight.  
6. Economic Times piece, 30 Jan 2026 – gives contemporaneous spot/high data; AI gold call is speculative, but hard numbers (silver touched $121.78) are factual.  
7. Agent report (compiled from Yahoo Finance, TradingEconomics, CME data) – summarises Jan spike and Feb draw-down; dates and magnitudes cross-check with Yahoo Finance; good context.  

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• Silver blow-off tops followed by 40 %+ corrections (Jan 1980, Apr 2011).  
• Other small-market commodities after parabolic spikes (nickel 2022).  
• Ordinary month-to-month silver volatility episodes (most years).  
Best fit: “blow-off + 40 % correction” class: it captures identical shock mechanics (margin hikes, leverage purge) and the same 2-to-4-month cooling window we are forecasting.

Empirical pattern from that class (n≈4 episodes across metals):  
– Highest price three months later is typically 55 %–90 % of the peak.  
– Chance of a new high within three months ≈15 %.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today → 1 Apr 2026 = 53 days; whole target month ends 30 Apr 2026 = 83 days.  
At 80 %–100 % annualised volatility (post-spike regime), two-month σ ≈ 0.32 in log terms (≈ ±38 % price moves one-σ). The question asks for the single highest daily price in April, so tail events matter more than the average path.

(d) Justification of outside-view baseline  
Current (7 Feb) close ≈ $76.  
Base-rate “cooling” suggests April max = 0.7 × January peak ≈ $85.  
Structural bulls (deficit, Fed cuts, geopolitical risk) push that up; persistent high margin and leverage overhang pull it down.  
Blend: set modal zone around $90 with fat tails:  
– Left tail: policy surprise + USD strength could retest $60.  
– Right tail: another short squeeze or severe geopolitical shock could briefly take price back to $120 +; probability small but non-zero.

Outside view calibration:

I fit a log-normal meant to reproduce:  
• Median ≈ $84  
• 10 % quantile ≈ $60 (-21 % from spot)  
• 90 % quantile ≈ $130 (+71 % from spot; slightly above prior ATH, matching ~15 % odds of new high)  

Checked monotonic increase and plausibility against historic upsets (silver frequently overshoots; 2011 & 1980 episodes show 10-15 % chance of new-high retest in this window).

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 60  
Percentile 20: 70  
Percentile 40: 80  
Percentile 60: 92  
Percentile 80: 110  
Percentile 90: 130
