    "description": "After opening 2025 at \\$30 per troy ounce, silver went on a bull run in 2025, with the white metal gaining more than 279% at its highest point. Prior to October 9, 2025, silver's all-time high had been \\$49.95, set forty-five years prior, on January 17, 1980. At the end of 2025, [experts continued to be optimistic for the future of silver](https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/precious-metals-investing/silver-investing/silver-forecast/). Indeed, silver continued its rally into 2026, gaining 70% in January alone and setting a new all-time high price of \\$121.62 on January 29, 2026. The price then dropped significantly, however, and silver closed January 2026 at \\$78.29.\n\n[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/silver-price-volatility-what-to-know-and-how-to-invest-152825562.html) summaries the recent volatility:\n\n> Analysts say silver's recent highs can be chalked up to several key macroeconomic factors, including a shift away from dollar-based assets, geopolitical tensions, and overall economic uncertainty.\n\n> \u201cIt\u2019s not about silver, it\u2019s about broader economic and political conditions,\u201d said Jeffrey Christian, an expert on precious metals markets and managing partner of CPM Group, in a presentation. Christian said economists are increasingly concerned about weakening labor conditions, persistent inflation, and the negative impacts of tariffs and trade restrictions, not only in the U.S. but also in the broader global economy.\n\n> Silver also sets itself apart from other precious metals because of its diverse applications. It\u2019s not only a hedge against macroeconomic tensions, but it\u2019s also a key component of virtually every piece of technology, including solar panels, smartphones, TVs, semiconductors, AI data centers, and more. This growing industrial demand for silver, however, has also led to a global supply shortage.\n\n> Despite its volatility, silver prices are forecast to increase this year \u201cdue to the physical supply constraints, robust demand for industrial purposes, and the rising interest of investors owing to economic uncertainty,\u201d said Peter Reagan, financial market strategist of precious metals IRA company Birch Gold Group.\n\n> \u201cSilver has historically been more volatile than gold,\u201d Reagan said. \"Gold is perceived to be stable, and silver has the potential to offer higher returns but with higher risk due to its industrial demand.\"\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41953,\"question_id\":41692}}`",
