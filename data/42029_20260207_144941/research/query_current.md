Analysis:
Silver has just experienced an historic spike – from $30 at the start of 2025 to an intraday all-time high of $121.62 on 29 Jan 2026 – followed by a sharp 36 % pull-back to $78.29 at January’s close.  The forecasting task is to estimate the single highest daily price that will print on Yahoo Finance during April 2026.

Key drivers I need fresh reporting on:
1. Macro policy path between now and April – especially Fed rate-cut expectations, U.S. inflation prints, recession odds, dollar trajectory and safe-haven flows.
2. Physical supply-demand balance – updated data on mine output (Mexico, Peru, China), secondary supply, and confirmed industrial orders (solar build-outs, EVs, AI data-centres).
3. Investor positioning – CFTC Commitment-of-Traders, ETF inflows/outflows, and any evidence of renewed retail squeeze attempts similar to 2021’s “Silver Squeeze”.
4. Geopolitical risk – escalation in the Red Sea, Ukraine, Taiwan or Middle-East that could spark another flight from fiat assets.
5. Options/futures term structure – reports of large April/May call activity or exchange-for-physical stress that could force prices higher.

The most relevant current information will therefore be:
• February 2026 analyst notes and bank outlooks that revise silver price targets for Q2-2026.  
• Newswire coverage of February-March industrial demand figures and any mine disruptions.  
• Interviews with major bullion traders or CME data pointing to option-driven price ceilings/floors.  
• February 2026 CPI/Fed commentary, since these will strongly influence precious-metal bids well into April.
