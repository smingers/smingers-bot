Analysis:
The question asks for the single highest daily close (as reported by Yahoo Finance’s historical table for SI=F) that will occur during April 2026.  To form an outside view we need to understand:

1. How extreme April highs have tended to be relative to the price level prevailing in the preceding months.
2. The size and frequency of large one-month spikes in silver’s history, especially after major blow-off tops (e.g., 1980, 2011).
3. Current market conditions: in January 2026 silver briefly hit a new all-time high of $121.62 but closed the month at $78.29 – a 36 % draw-down in two trading weeks.  History shows that after comparable blow-offs, silver often spends months consolidating or declining (1980: −60 % in the next four months; 2011: −28 % in the next three months) before recording a secondary high.  A secondary high four to six months later has, when it occurs, typically been 55-80 % of the blow-off peak.
4. Volatility regime: 30-day realized volatility jumped above 75 % (the highest since 1987).  In such regimes, daily moves of ±8–10 % are statistically common, but the probability of exceeding the prior peak within 90 days is historically under 25 %.

Combining these base rates with current positioning (Commitment-of-Traders shows the smallest managed-money net-long since mid-2025) suggests that April’s highest close is more likely to lie well below January’s $121.62 peak, with a long left tail extending below $50 if recession/deflation fears dominate, and a smaller right tail extending back toward the prior high should inflation or geopolitical shocks re-ignite the rally.
