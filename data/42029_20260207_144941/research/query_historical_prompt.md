Forecasting Question:
What will be the highest price of silver per troy ounce in April 2026?

Question background:
After opening 2025 at \$30 per troy ounce, silver went on a bull run in 2025, with the white metal gaining more than 279% at its highest point. Prior to October 9, 2025, silver's all-time high had been \$49.95, set forty-five years prior, on January 17, 1980. At the end of 2025, [experts continued to be optimistic for the future of silver](https://investingnews.com/daily/resource-investing/precious-metals-investing/silver-investing/silver-forecast/). Indeed, silver continued its rally into 2026, gaining 70% in January alone and setting a new all-time high price of \$121.62 on January 29, 2026. The price then dropped significantly, however, and silver closed January 2026 at \$78.29.

[Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/personal-finance/investing/article/silver-price-volatility-what-to-know-and-how-to-invest-152825562.html) summaries the recent volatility:

> Analysts say silver's recent highs can be chalked up to several key macroeconomic factors, including a shift away from dollar-based assets, geopolitical tensions, and overall economic uncertainty.

> “It’s not about silver, it’s about broader economic and political conditions,” said Jeffrey Christian, an expert on precious metals markets and managing partner of CPM Group, in a presentation. Christian said economists are increasingly concerned about weakening labor conditions, persistent inflation, and the negative impacts of tariffs and trade restrictions, not only in the U.S. but also in the broader global economy.

> Silver also sets itself apart from other precious metals because of its diverse applications. It’s not only a hedge against macroeconomic tensions, but it’s also a key component of virtually every piece of technology, including solar panels, smartphones, TVs, semiconductors, AI data centers, and more. This growing industrial demand for silver, however, has also led to a global supply shortage.

> Despite its volatility, silver prices are forecast to increase this year “due to the physical supply constraints, robust demand for industrial purposes, and the rising interest of investors owing to economic uncertainty,” said Peter Reagan, financial market strategist of precious metals IRA company Birch Gold Group.

> “Silver has historically been more volatile than gold,” Reagan said. "Gold is perceived to be stable, and silver has the potential to offer higher returns but with higher risk due to its industrial demand."

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-07. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-07 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

The lower bound is 40.0 and the upper bound is 140.0.
Both bounds are OPEN: outcomes can fall below the lower bound or above the upper bound. Your percentile estimates may extend beyond this range if well-supported by evidence.
Zero point: 0.0 (logarithmic scale - think in terms of ratios/multipliers rather than absolute differences).

Note that this is a numeric question, with expected answer format as a discrete CDF (not required for this answer).

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model equipped with capable web crawlers and designed to generate lengthy, detailed responses. As such, you may use a longer query with detailed instructions. It is possible to ask multiple questions.
Nonetheless, you are advised to keep your query to at most three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic indicators, financial data, interest rates, employment, GDP, inflation, trade statistics, or any quantitative economic metric, use FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) to retrieve official historical data. Your query should describe the economic indicator (e.g., "US unemployment rate" or "consumer price index") or use a known FRED series ID directly (e.g., "UNRATE" or "CPIAUCSL"). This returns historical data with computed statistics for establishing base rates.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () **on the same line as and after** the query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for Agent. Add a FRED query if the question involves economic/financial data.
