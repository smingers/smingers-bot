The estimated trading volume was 190,619 contracts, with Thursday\u2019s volume at 261,279 and open interest at 407,179, down 6,692 from the prior day.

Although silver's price rally in January 2026 saw a rise of approximately 70%, leading to profit-taking and outflows from silver ETFs, a notable recovery is already underway. The all-time high above $121 per troy ounce remains out of reach for now. Global economic outlooks are positive: the World Bank raised its 2026 growth forecast to 2.6%, with 2025 and 2027 projected at 2.7% each, driven by industrial recovery and stabilization in emerging markets. Investment in infrastructure and future technologies is increasing. Discovery Silver Corp. holds the promising Cordero project in Mexico, with over 300 million ounces of silver reserves, and has recently begun gold production, with gold sales rising 56% in Q3 2025 compared to Q2. Endeavour Silver Corp., another major producer in Mexico, Chile, and Peru, reported an 88% year-on-year increase in silver-equivalent production in Q3 2025 and raised capital through convertible bonds.

This decline was more pronounced than the drop in gold prices, which fell 7.8% from a high of $5,318.40 per troy ounce on March 29 to $4,905.00 on the same day. Silver\u2019s higher volatility compared to gold is attributed to its smaller market size and strong correlation with macroeconomic factors, which have historically led to sharp corrections from peaks. The surge in silver prices triggered a record one-day trading volume of $39.4 billion for the iShares Silver Trust (SLV), a major silver ETF, on March 26. Analysts point to a wave of forced liquidations among speculative investors who had leveraged positions in silver derivatives, leading to margin calls and cascading sell-offs. Chinese investors, who had driven up prices through speculative inflows\u2014including individual investors and large equity funds\u2014rapidly shifted to selling as the rally stalled. Market analysts, including Bloomberg, suggest further declines are possible, with a key support level at $70 per troy ounce and a potential drop to $60 if risk-aversion intensifies across asset markets. No clear rebound signal has emerged after the sharp fall.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 08:36 AM\nSource:[\uc778\ud130\ub137\ub274\uc2a4 \ud55c\uacbd\ub2f7\ucef4](https://www.hankyung.com/article/2026020698331)\n\n**Platinum Price Falls 33% Below Historical High**\nThe price of platinum has fallen to 33% below its all-time high, according to trading data from Friday, February 6, 2026. As of 10:18 MSK, the April platinum futures price dropped 5.77% from the previous close, settling at $1,951.10 per troy ounce. This marks a 33% decline from the historical peak of $2,915 reached on January 26, 2026. The lowest intraday price during the session was $1,806, the lowest since December 16, 2025.

Should investors buy this dip?**\nOn February 6, 2026, MCX silver futures for March 2026 dropped 6% to Rs 2,29,187 per kg, while gold futures for April 2026 delivery declined 2% to Rs 1,49,396 per 10 grams, driven by a global tech selloff and a stronger U.S. dollar. This marked the second consecutive day of losses, following a 4.5% margin hike on February 5 and an additional 2.5% on silver and 2% on gold today, raising total margins to 7% for silver and 3% for gold. The increased margin requirements likely triggered profit booking and forced unwinding, contributing to volatility. Internationally, spot gold rose 0.4% to $4,790.80 per ounce but remained down 1.4% for the week; spot silver fell 10% intraday, hitting a 1.5-month low below $65. Experts, including Manoj Kumar Jain of Prithvi Finmart, warned of continued volatility due to the U.S.-Iran nuclear deal talks, U.S. partial government shutdown, and geopolitical tensions. Gold support is seen at $4,770\u2013$4,640 and resistance at $4,955\u2013$5,050 per troy ounce; silver support at $71.20\u2013$64.00 and resistance at $84.40\u2013$88.80. On MCX, gold support is at Rs 1,50,500\u20131,47,700 and resistance at Rs 1,54,200\u20131,55,800; silver support at Rs 2,25,000\u20132,12,000 and resistance at Rs 2,54,000\u20132,64,000. Jain advised investors to avoid the market until stability returns.

MCX silver March futures dropped sharply by 6%. Internationally, U.S. gold futures for April delivery declined nearly 2% to $4,806.50 per troy ounce, driven by a stronger dollar. The decline was further fueled by easing geopolitical tensions and reduced investor appetite. However, expectations of future U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts remain a key supportive factor for gold, according to market experts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 03:42 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/market/commodities/gold-price-today-rate-climbs-on-mcx-on-value-buying-silver-rate-in-focus-experts-highlight-key-levels-to-watch-11770348346901.html)\n\n**Silver Crashes Further: Is This the Moment the Panic Turns?**\nSilver prices experienced a dramatic crash on Friday, February 4, 2026, falling nearly 30% in a single day after a 146% surge in the year-to-date. Following a brief recovery, prices dropped again on Thursday, with the spot price falling by up to 16% and settling around 79 US dollars per troy ounce, a 10.5% decline from the previous close. Futures in New York also declined sharply. Analysts attribute the volatility not to physical demand but to a dangerous mix of speculation, high leverage, and options-driven trading. Large positions had built up over weeks, and a portion remains unsettled, making any reversal highly risky. The situation is exacerbated by rising margin requirements after the sell-off, forcing leveraged traders to either inject more capital or close positions\u2014potentially triggering a chain reaction of stop-loss orders. Silver is reacting more violently than gold, which fell only about 1% to roughly 4,911 US dollars per ounce, due to lower liquidity in the London market. The price swings have drawn comparisons to meme stocks, though silver has real industrial applications in solar energy and electronics. This creates a dangerous disconnect: strong fundamentals coexist with extreme short-term market panic. The article raises concern that the market may be nearing a tipping point of panic. \nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 07:45 AM\nSource:[wallstreet-online.de](https://www.wallstreet-online.de/nachricht/20458901-edelmetall-silber-crasht-weiter-moment-panik-kippt)\n\n**Sharp Decline in Gold and Silver Prices Amid Widespread Sell-Off**\nGold and silver prices plummeted sharply on Thursday amid a broad-based sell-off in the market, driven by a rise in the U.S. dollar to its highest level in nearly two weeks and signs of decreasing trade tensions between the United States and China.

This surge was driven by escalating global geopolitical and economic tensions. The U.S. gold futures contract for April delivery rose 1.8% to $5,036.80 per ounce, signaling continued upward momentum. Silver surged 2.1% to $89.88 per ounce, following a record high of $121.64 earlier in the week.

The recovery followed a sharp decline: gold had dropped from a peak of Rs 1,83,493 per 10 grams on 30 January 2026 to Rs 1,50,890 on 2 February 2026, a fall of Rs 32,603, while silver fell from a lifetime high of Rs 4,20,048 to Rs 2,84,800, a drop of Rs 1,35,248. The rebound was driven by a weaker US dollar, value buying, and short covering. Analyst Manav Modi of Motilal Oswal Financial Services Ltd noted that investor interest has returned after a nearly 15% correction in three trading days. In India, MCX April 2026 gold futures rose 3.83% to Rs 1,59,700, and silver jumped 6.26% to Rs 2,84,800. Strong physical demand in Shenzhen ahead of the Lunar New Year, coupled with tightened gold investment rules by Chinese state banks, influenced the market. Global sentiment improved due to reports of a potential India-EU trade deal and comments from US President Donald Trump on reducing tariffs with India, though official confirmation is pending.

On Thursday, the exchange price of silver reached a record high of $49.965, surpassing the previous peak of $49.82 set in April 2011. Khalin stated that while a short-term technical correction is possible, the fundamental outlook remains strong due to a significant physical deficit in silver and minimal supply response. He noted that approximately 80% of silver supply comes as a byproduct of mining other metals or through secondary recycling. Since the beginning of the year, silver prices have increased by over 63%, rising from $29.242 per ounce on December 31 of the previous year to the current level.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 06:30 AM\nSource:[\u041f\u0420\u0410\u0419\u041c](https://1prime.ru/20251011/serebro-863404365.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
