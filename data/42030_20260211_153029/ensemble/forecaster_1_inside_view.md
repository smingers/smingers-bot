Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

**China.org.cn/Xinhua (Feb 10, 2026)**: Official Chinese state news reporting Copernicus data. Factual: January 2026 was 5th warmest globally (12.95°C), 0.28°C cooler than January 2025; SST averaged 20.68°C (4th highest for January), 0.29°C below January 2024 record. Expert opinion from Samantha Burgess (Copernicus) on climate extremes. High-quality source, very recent (1 day old). Critical for establishing current SST baseline.

**Climate.copernicus.eu (Jan 2026 data)**: Primary climate monitoring source using ERA5 dataset. Factual: January 2026 SST was 20.68°C globally; **"A large region of the subtropical and northeast North Atlantic had the warmest SSTs on record for the time of year"** (January). This is crucial - parts of North Atlantic already set January records. High-quality, authoritative source, published Feb 2026.

**Nature article (Feb 4, 2026)**: Peer-reviewed research on Atlantic SST-Arctic sea ice relationships. No direct information about current North Atlantic SST records or Feb-Apr 2026 forecasts. Establishes Caribbean Sea and Gulf Stream as key regions for SST variability. Medium relevance - provides context but no predictive information.

**Weather.com (Jan 21, 2026)**: U.S. temperature/precipitation outlook for Feb-Apr 2026. Discusses weak La Niña transitioning to ENSO-neutral. No information on North Atlantic SSTs. Low relevance to question.

**NOAA/Weather.gov (Summer 2025)**: Retrospective on summer 2025 showing above-normal Atlantic SSTs. Confirms 2025 had elevated SSTs but is dated (summer 2025, 6+ months old). Low relevance for Feb-Apr 2026 prediction.

**Severe-weather.eu (Jan 9, 2026)**: Discusses La Niña collapse and transition to El Niño by Fall 2026. Factual: La Niña peaked late Fall 2025, weakening since then; westerly wind burst forecast mid-January; subsurface warm pool developing. Expert analysis from meteorologist Andrej Flis. Medium-high quality for ENSO context, dated Jan 9 (33 days old).

**AskNews articles (multiple sources, Feb 10, 2026)**: Consistent reporting across multiple international outlets (Xinhua, Copernicus, RFI, etc.) confirming:
- January 2026 was 5th warmest globally
- **North Atlantic (including Norwegian Sea) recorded record-high SSTs for January**
- Global SST was 20.68°C (4th highest for January)
- Arctic sea ice 6% below average (3rd lowest)

**Critical finding**: Multiple sources confirm parts of North Atlantic already set January 2026 records. The question asks about Feb-Apr, so January records don't count, but this indicates the region is at record-warm levels entering the forecast period.

**Daily Sabah (Jan 12, 2026)**: Reports 2025 ocean heat content was highest on record (9th consecutive year). North-West Pacific exceeded average by 3°C; North Atlantic and Mediterranean up to 1.5°C above average in 2025. Establishes 2025 baseline. Medium quality, dated.

**Xinhua/North Sea report (Jan 7, 2026)**: North Sea (not North Atlantic proper) reached record 11.6°C average in 2025. Relevant for regional context but North Sea is distinct from broader North Atlantic. Medium relevance.

**RFI (Jan 7, 2026)**: North Sea warmest on record in 2025 (11.6°C). Baltic Sea second-warmest. 55-day marine heatwave at Kiel. Confirms 2025 was exceptional but focuses on North Sea specifically. Medium relevance.

**Korean news (Oct 18, 2025)**: North Pacific (not North Atlantic) had hottest summer on record July-Sept 2024. Discusses IMO shipping regulations and Chinese pollution reduction as warming factors. Low direct relevance to North Atlantic Feb-Apr 2026.

**Polish/German sources (Sept-Oct 2025)**: Report spring 2024 global SST reached record 21°C; Baltic/North Sea warming faster than global average. Dated (4-5 months old), provides historical context. Low relevance for Feb-Apr 2026 prediction.

(b) Evidence analysis:

**Strong evidence:**
1. **Multiple sources confirm North Atlantic set January 2026 records**: Copernicus official report states "A large region of the subtropical and northeast North Atlantic had the warmest SSTs on record for the time of year" (January). This is independently confirmed by multiple news outlets citing the same Copernicus data. This means the North Atlantic is entering February at record-warm levels for the season.

2. **La Niña weakening/transitioning**: Severe-weather.eu (Jan 9) and multiple sources confirm La Niña peaked in late Fall 2025 and is weakening. Westerly wind burst occurred mid-January. ENSO-neutral expected by late March/April. This removes a suppressing factor on Atlantic SSTs.

**Moderate evidence:**
1. **January 2026 cooler than January 2025 globally**: Global SST was 0.29°C below January 2024 record, suggesting some cooling from 2024-2025 peaks. However, this is global data - the North Atlantic specifically set January records, indicating regional divergence.

2. **Seasonal trajectory**: February-April is late winter/early spring. Historical patterns show this isn't peak SST season (that's August-September), but the question only requires beating the same-day record from any previous year, not setting an absolute annual peak.

3. **Persistent aerosol forcing**: Background warming from reduced shipping SO₂ emissions continues (+0.13 W m⁻²), providing ongoing forcing.

**Weak evidence:**
1. **Polar vortex disruption forecast**: Severe-weather.eu predicted cold air outbreaks for February, but this is atmospheric, not oceanic, and forecasts from 33 days ago have limited reliability.

2. **Arctic sea ice below average**: 6% below average suggests overall warmth in northern latitudes, but indirect connection to North Atlantic SST records.

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Prediction timeframe**: 79 days remaining (Feb 11 - Apr 30, 2026)

**If timeframe were halved (40 days, ending ~March 22)**:
- Probability would decrease to ~8-10%. La Niña still dominant, less time for transition effects, shorter window for marine heatwave development.

**If timeframe were doubled (158 days, ending ~July 18)**:
- Probability would increase significantly to ~40-50%. This would include May-July when North Atlantic SSTs naturally rise seasonally, La Niña would be fully transitioned to neutral or El Niño, and summer marine heatwaves become more likely.

The 79-day window is moderately favorable - long enough to capture La Niña transition effects and early spring warming, but not long enough to reach peak SST season.

(d) Justification:

**Critical update from sources**: The outside view analysis (11%) was based on the assumption that 2026 was running 0.2-0.3°C below 2025 levels. However, **the Copernicus report directly contradicts this for the North Atlantic specifically**: "A large region of the subtropical and northeast North Atlantic had the warmest SSTs on record for the time of year" in January 2026.

This is a major factor that renders the reference class analysis partially invalid. The outside view was calibrated on global SST patterns and the assumption of a deficit, but the North Atlantic region has already set January records.

**Key factors shifting prediction upward:**

1. **North Atlantic already at record levels**: If January 2026 set records for that month, the region is starting February at historically elevated levels. The question asks if *any day* Feb-Apr will beat the same-day record - this is now much more plausible since the baseline is already record-warm.

2. **La Niña weakening removes suppression**: The transition from La Niña to neutral (expected by late March/April) will reduce the cooling influence on Atlantic SSTs. This timing aligns well with the late portion of the forecast window.

3. **Regional vs. global divergence**: Global SSTs being 4th-warmest for January doesn't preclude regional records. The North Atlantic is behaving differently than global averages, showing stronger warming.

4. **Marine heatwave potential**: The 2025 sources document multiple marine heatwaves in the North Atlantic. With the region already at record warmth and La Niña weakening, conditions favor heatwave development.

**Factors limiting upward revision:**

1. **January records don't count**: The question period starts Feb 1, so January's records are irrelevant. However, they establish that the region is primed for continued record-breaking.

2. **Seasonal trajectory still matters**: Even with record January warmth, February-April is not peak season. But the question only requires beating same-day records from any year, not absolute peaks.

3. **Weather variability**: Short-term atmospheric patterns (cold air outbreaks, cloud cover, wind patterns) can temporarily suppress SSTs even in a warm regime.

**Calibration logic:**

The outside view of 11% was based on:
- 0.2-0.3°C deficit (now known to be false for North Atlantic)
- La Niña suppression (weakening)
- Unfavorable seasonality (still true but less important)

The new information suggests:
- North Atlantic at record warmth entering February
- La Niña transitioning out during forecast period
- 79 days is sufficient time for at least one day to exceed previous same-day records

Given that January already set records and La Niña is weakening, the probability that at least one day in Feb-Apr will beat its same-day record should be substantially higher than 11%.

However, tempering factors:
- Only need one day to qualify, but also only have 79 days
- Weather variability could produce cold snaps
- Seasonal trajectory still not optimal

Probability calibration:

Starting from outside view of 11%, the critical new information (North Atlantic already at January records) is strong evidence that substantially increases the probability. The region is demonstrably warmer than the outside view assumed.

Considering:
- **Strong evidence** (North Atlantic January records + La Niña weakening) suggests 2-3x increase from base rate
- **Moderate evidence** (seasonal factors, regional divergence) supports additional increase
- **Weak evidence** (atmospheric variability) provides minor downward pressure

Revised estimate: 11% × 2.5 = 27.5%, then adjusting for:
- High confidence in January record data (+5%)
- Uncertainty in La Niña transition timing (-3%)
- Weather variability risk (-2%)

Final calibration: ~28%

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will North Atlantic daily mean SST exceed the same-day record from any previous year on any day between Feb 1 and Apr 30, 2026? (79 days remaining)

2. **Base rate check**: Outside view was 11% based on La Niña + seasonal factors + assumed deficit. Current circumstances differ significantly: North Atlantic already set January 2026 records, indicating region is warmer than outside view assumed. This justifies substantial upward revision.

3. **Consistency check**: "28 out of 100 times, at least one day in Feb-Apr 2026 sees North Atlantic SST exceed its same-day historical record." This aligns with: region already at record warmth, La Niña weakening, 79-day window providing multiple opportunities, but seasonal factors and weather variability creating uncertainty.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - North Atlantic set January 2026 records per Copernicus (verified, strong)
   - La Niña weakening, ENSO-neutral by late March (verified, moderate-strong)
   - 79 days provides multiple opportunities for at least one record day (logical)
   - Seasonal trajectory not optimal for rapid warming (verified, moderate)
   - Weather variability can suppress SSTs temporarily (general principle, weak)

5. **Blind-spot**: La Niña persists longer than forecast and/or a strong polar vortex collapse brings sustained cold air masses over the North Atlantic in February-March, suppressing SSTs below record levels despite the warm January start. This could drop probability to ~15%.

6. **Status quo**: Current status quo is North Atlantic at record January warmth. If this simply continues (no major cooling or warming), we'd expect at least some days in Feb-Apr to exceed their same-day records given the elevated baseline. This supports a probability above 25%.

Probability: 28%
