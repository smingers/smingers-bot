Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

**ClimateReanalyzer Technical Documentation** (climatereanalyzer.org): This is the primary data source for the question resolution. It's a technical documentation page from the Climate Change Institute at University of Maine, describing NOAA OISST v2.1 data. The key caveat is that "any apparent record high or low values in OISST should be considered with caution and evaluated against other datasets." This is a high-quality, authoritative source for the actual data that will determine the question outcome. Date: Undated technical documentation (current as of question opening).

**Copernicus Article on Shipping Emissions** (2024): Published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics, this is a peer-reviewed scientific study. It provides factual data on the 80% reduction in shipping SO₂ emissions from 2020 IMO regulations and quantifies the warming effect at +0.13 W m⁻² globally. The authors' interpretation that this "may help explain part of the rapid jump in global temperatures" is expert opinion backed by modeling. High-quality source. Date: 2024 (before question period).

**NPR Article** (August 14, 2024): News article featuring multiple named climate scientists (Andrew Dessler, Stephen Smith, Andrew Gettelman, Gregory Kopp). Factual information includes the 15-month streak of record ocean temperatures starting April 2023. Expert opinions are clearly attributed. The scientists identify climate change + El Niño as primary causes, with shipping regulations as a possible contributor. Medium-high quality for understanding context. Date: August 2024 (before question period).

**Copernicus Surface Air Temperature Report** (August 2025): Official climate monitoring report from Copernicus using ERA5 dataset. Provides factual temperature data showing August 2025 was third-warmest on record (0.22°C cooler than 2023/2024 records). This is surface air temperature, not sea surface temperature, but indicates the global cooling trend from peak 2023-2024 levels. High-quality source. Date: August 2025 (5 months before question period).

**Mercator Ocean Mid-Year Highlights 2025**: Analyzes North Atlantic SST data through June 2025. Provides methodology for marine heatwave tracking but lacks specific numerical values for 2025 SSTs in the text excerpt. Medium quality due to incomplete information. Date: Mid-2025 (7-8 months before question period).

**NOAA Arctic Report** (October 10, 2025): Focuses on Arctic Ocean SSTs, not North Atlantic specifically. Key fact: "August 2025 mean Arctic Ocean SST was the second warmest on record, exceeded only by August 2007." This suggests a cooling from 2023-2024 peaks in Arctic waters. Date: October 2025 (4 months before question period).

**Severe Weather Europe** (January 23, 2026): Weather forecasting article predicting polar vortex collapse and cold air outbreaks for February 2026. This is a forecast, not historical data. The predicted cold air masses over North America and Europe could suppress North Atlantic SSTs. Medium quality for understanding atmospheric context. Date: January 23, 2026 (19 days before question opening).

**NOAA Winter Outlook 2025-26** (November 20, 2025): Official seasonal forecast indicating La Niña conditions continuing through winter 2025-26, with transition to ENSO-neutral most likely January-March 2026. La Niña typically suppresses North Atlantic SSTs. High-quality source for ENSO context. Date: November 2025 (3 months before question period).

**Agent Report**: Synthesizes Climate Reanalyzer data showing Jan-Feb 2026 SSTs running 0.2-0.3°C below corresponding 2025 dates, though still well above pre-2023 levels. Attributes the cooling to La Niña transition from El Niño. The report notes 2026 values remain near-record but below 2025's extraordinary levels. This is a synthesis of multiple sources with reasonable expert interpretation. The key factual claim is that every day in Jan-Feb 2026 has been cooler than the same day in 2025.

(b) Reference class analysis:

**Reference Class 1: Daily SST records in the North Atlantic (2020-2026 period)**
This narrow class focuses on the post-IMO regulation period when the aerosol forcing changed dramatically. From the sources, 2023 and 2024 set numerous daily records, with 2025 continuing this trend. However, 2026 has started cooler than 2025. Suitability: High - directly relevant to the question's mechanism.

**Reference Class 2: Year-over-year daily SST records in any year**
Historically, daily SST records are broken relatively frequently during warming trends, but require specific conditions (El Niño, reduced aerosols, marine heatwaves). The question asks if 2026 will beat records set primarily in 2023-2025. Suitability: Medium - too broad without considering recent exceptional conditions.

**Reference Class 3: SST behavior during La Niña to ENSO-neutral transitions (Feb-April)**
La Niña typically suppresses North Atlantic SSTs. The transition to neutral (expected by April 2026) might allow some warming, but the question period ends May 1. Historical La Niña winters show cooler patterns. Suitability: High - captures the ENSO dynamics relevant to the forecast period.

**Most suitable reference class**: The post-2020 daily SST record-setting behavior during different ENSO phases, specifically focusing on whether late winter/early spring can produce records when starting from a La Niña-suppressed baseline.

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Prediction timeframe**: February 11, 2026 to April 30, 2026 (79 days remaining)

**Historical patterns over similar periods**:
- The question asks about Feb-April, which is late winter/early spring in the Northern Hemisphere
- From the Agent Report: 2025's local winter peak was around February 15 at ~21.0°C
- North Atlantic SSTs typically peak in late summer (August-September), not in late winter/spring
- The seasonal trajectory from February to April is generally flat to slightly rising, but not a period of rapid warming
- 2023 and 2024 set records across multiple months, including spring months
- However, 2026 has started 0.2-0.3°C below 2025 levels and would need to overcome this deficit plus add additional warming to set new records

**Key temporal factors**:
- Only 79 days remain for a record to occur
- La Niña is expected to persist through at least February, possibly into March
- Transition to ENSO-neutral expected by April, but this is late in the question period
- Polar vortex disruption forecast for February could bring cold air masses that suppress SSTs
- The seasonal trajectory is not favorable for rapid warming in this period

(d) Justification:

The outside view suggests a low probability of a new daily North Atlantic SST record before May 2026, based on several converging factors:

**Baseline deficit**: Every day in January and early February 2026 has been 0.2-0.3°C cooler than the corresponding 2025 dates. While still historically warm (well above pre-2023 levels), this represents a significant gap to overcome.

**ENSO dynamics**: The transition from El Niño (which boosted 2025 SSTs) to La Niña (which suppresses Atlantic SSTs) is the primary driver of the 2026 cooling. La Niña is forecast to persist through most of the question period, with ENSO-neutral conditions not expected until late March or April. This timing is unfavorable for a late-period surge.

**Seasonal trajectory**: February-April is not a period of rapid SST increase in the North Atlantic. The seasonal cycle shows relatively flat temperatures through late winter, with warming accelerating only in late spring/summer. To set a record, 2026 would need to not only close the 0.2-0.3°C gap but exceed 2025's peak values during a seasonally unfavorable period.

**Atmospheric conditions**: The forecasted polar vortex collapse and associated cold air outbreaks in February could further suppress North Atlantic SSTs, at least temporarily.

**Positive factors**: The persistent aerosol forcing from reduced shipping emissions (+0.13 W m⁻²) continues to provide background warming. The mixed-layer shallowing trend increases sensitivity to radiative forcing. If La Niña weakens rapidly and transitions to neutral by late March, there could be some rebound.

**Historical precedent**: 2023 and 2024 set numerous daily records across multiple seasons, showing that the post-2020 regime can produce exceptional values. However, those years had more favorable ENSO conditions. The question is whether 2026 can overcome its La Niña handicap in just 79 days.

Outside view calibration:

The key tethering point from the sources is the Agent Report's finding that 2026 is running 0.2-0.3°C below 2025 levels. To set a new daily record, 2026 would need to:
1. Close this gap (requiring ~0.2-0.3°C warming relative to current trajectory)
2. Exceed 2025's peak values by at least 0.01°C (requiring additional warming)
3. Do this within 79 days during a seasonally unfavorable period with La Niña conditions

The probability of this occurring seems low. Historical patterns show that:
- La Niña conditions typically persist for several months
- Late winter/early spring is not a period of rapid North Atlantic SST increase
- The 0.2-0.3°C deficit is substantial given the short timeframe

However, the probability is not negligible because:
- The aerosol forcing continues to provide background warming
- Marine heatwaves can develop rapidly under certain conditions
- 2026 SSTs remain historically elevated (second-highest on record for many days)
- Weather variability could produce a brief warm spike

Considering the rate of upsets in climate forecasting: Climate patterns generally follow predictable seasonal and ENSO-driven cycles, but marine heatwaves and atmospheric blocking patterns can produce surprises. The 2023 North Atlantic heatwave was partially unexpected in its magnitude. However, the combination of La Niña, unfavorable seasonality, and the existing deficit makes an upset less likely here than in other climate domains.

A rough calibration:
- If this were August-September (peak SST season): ~30-40% chance
- If ENSO were neutral or El Niño: ~25-35% chance  
- Given La Niña + late winter/spring timing + existing deficit: ~8-15% range

The lower end (~8%) accounts for La Niña persistence and seasonal factors. The upper end (~15%) allows for rapid La Niña weakening, an unexpected marine heatwave, or atmospheric blocking that produces anomalous warming.
