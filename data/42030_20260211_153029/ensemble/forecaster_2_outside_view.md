Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

**ClimateReanalyzer.org (Technical documentation)**: This is the primary data source for the question resolution. It's a highly credible academic source from the University of Maine's Climate Change Institute. The page explains that data comes from NOAA OISST v2.1 with a 1-2 day lag. Critically, it warns that "any apparent record high or low values in OISST should be considered with caution and evaluated against other datasets." This is pure technical documentation with no opinions, dated as current infrastructure.

**Grosvenor et al., Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (2024)**: Peer-reviewed scientific study quantifying the warming effect of reduced shipping sulfur emissions. Key factual finding: ~0.13 W m⁻² global aerosol forcing from the 2020 IMO regulation, with predictions of 0.04 K global warming and 0.15 K Arctic warming averaged over 2020-2049. This is high-quality scientific evidence with expert consensus, published before the forecast period.

**NPR Article (August 2024)**: News article featuring multiple named climate scientists. Key facts: oceans were in record territory for 15 months starting April 2023. Expert Andrew Dessler (Texas A&M) identifies climate change and El Niño as primary causes, with some additional warming unexplained. Andrew Gettelman notes cleaner shipping fuel "could be contributing." Gregory Kopp rules out solar activity. Mix of facts and expert opinions from credible sources.

**Copernicus Climate (August 2025)**: Official EU climate monitoring service. Reports August 2025 was third-warmest August on record, 0.22°C cooler than record Augusts of 2023 and 2024. This is factual observational data from a highly credible source, dated August 2025 (past event from our 2026-02-11 perspective).

**Mercator Ocean International (Mid-year 2025)**: Ocean monitoring service analyzing Jan-Jun 2025 North Atlantic SST. Provides methodology for marine heatwave detection. This is factual monitoring data from a credible oceanographic institution, covering first half of 2025.

**NOAA Arctic Report Card (October 2025)**: Official NOAA report by Tracey Nakamura. **Critical fact**: "August 2025 mean Arctic Ocean SST was the second warmest on record, exceeded only by August 2007." Also notes Kara Sea had warmest August on record. This is highly credible observational data but focuses on Arctic, not specifically North Atlantic. Dated October 2025 (past).

**Severe Weather Europe (January 2026)**: Weather forecasting site reporting on polar vortex collapse and stratospheric warming event for February 2026. Predicts cold air release across North America and Europe. This is a forecast/prediction, not observational data. The site has forecasting expertise but this represents opinion about future weather patterns.

**NOAA Weather Forecast Offices (November 2025, Winter Outlook)**: Official NOAA seasonal outlooks for winter 2025-26. Reports La Niña conditions continuing with 51% chance through Dec-Feb 2025-26, transitioning to ENSO-neutral by Jan-Mar 2026 (61% chance). This is official meteorological forecast data from the authoritative U.S. weather agency.

**Agent Report**: Synthesizes Climate Reanalyzer data showing Jan-Feb 2026 running 0.2-0.3°C cooler than same period in 2025, but still warmer than all pre-2023 years. Attributes the cooling to ENSO transition from El Niño (2025) to La Niña (2026). Notes aerosol forcing from 2020 shipping regulations remains constant. This analysis integrates multiple sources and provides specific temperature comparisons, though exact daily values aren't fully tabulated.

(b) Reference class analysis:

**Reference Class 1: Daily North Atlantic SST records in recent years (2020-2025)**
- 2023 set numerous daily records throughout the year
- 2024 matched or slightly exceeded many 2023 records
- 2025 set new records in early months
- Suitability: HIGH - Most directly relevant, captures the recent unprecedented warming regime

**Reference Class 2: Daily SST records during La Niña vs El Niño years**
- La Niña typically suppresses North Atlantic SST relative to El Niño
- Historical La Niña winters show cooler patterns
- 2026 is transitioning from La Niña to neutral
- Suitability: MEDIUM-HIGH - Relevant for understanding ENSO influence, but recent years show unprecedented baseline warming that may override typical ENSO patterns

**Reference Class 3: Spring (Feb-Apr) SST record-setting frequency**
- Need to examine whether spring months typically set records vs summer/fall
- Historical data shows summer months more prone to records
- Suitability: MEDIUM - Seasonal patterns matter, but limited data on spring record frequency in recent extreme years

**Most suitable reference class**: Recent years (2023-2025) daily North Atlantic SST patterns, particularly comparing ENSO states, as this captures both the unprecedented warming regime and the relevant ENSO dynamics.

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Prediction timeframe**: February 11, 2026 to April 30, 2026 = approximately 78 days (2.5 months)

**Historical patterns**:
- The question asks if ANY day from Feb 1 - Apr 30, 2026 will exceed the same calendar day's record from any previous year
- Agent report confirms: Jan-Feb 2026 has been running 0.2-0.3°C below corresponding days in 2025
- 2025 set records throughout its early months, exceeding 2023-2024
- North Atlantic SST typically shows seasonal patterns with spring warming
- The question background states "North Atlantic Sea Surface Temperatures have started out high in 2026, but have so far been lower than during 2025"

**Key temporal factors**:
- La Niña is expected to weaken toward neutral by April 2026 (per NOAA outlook)
- Polar vortex disruption in February could affect atmospheric patterns
- Spring warming typically accelerates in March-April
- Only 78 days remain for a record to occur

(d) Justification:

The forecasting question asks whether any single day between Feb 1-Apr 30, 2026 will set a new daily record for North Atlantic SST compared to the same calendar day in all previous years.

**Factors favoring "No" (no new record)**:
1. **Current trajectory**: Every day in Jan-Feb 2026 has been 0.2-0.3°C cooler than the corresponding 2025 day, which itself set records
2. **ENSO state**: La Niña conditions suppress North Atlantic SST relative to the El Niño conditions that boosted 2025. La Niña is forecast to persist through at least February, only transitioning to neutral by March-April
3. **Magnitude of deficit**: A 0.2-0.3°C deficit is substantial - it would require an unusual rapid warming surge to overcome this gap in just 2.5 months
4. **Seasonal timing**: Spring months (Feb-Apr) are not typically when maximum SST anomalies occur; summer months show stronger warming
5. **Polar vortex disruption**: The forecast stratospheric warming event could bring cooler atmospheric conditions to the North Atlantic region in February

**Factors favoring "Yes" (new record set)**:
1. **Persistent aerosol forcing**: The +0.13 W m⁻² forcing from reduced shipping emissions continues to warm the North Atlantic
2. **High baseline**: Despite being cooler than 2025, Jan-Feb 2026 remains ~0.4°C warmer than all pre-2023 years, showing the elevated baseline
3. **ENSO transition**: As La Niña weakens toward neutral in March-April, some of its suppressive effect may diminish
4. **Natural variability**: Short-term weather patterns or ocean dynamics could produce brief warming spikes
5. **78 days of opportunity**: With 78 days remaining, there are many chances for at least one day to exceed its historical record
6. **Precedent**: 2023, 2024, and 2025 all set numerous daily records, showing the recent regime is capable of repeated record-breaking

**Critical assessment**:
The question requires beating the same-calendar-day record, not just any record. Since 2025 set records on most days in Feb-Apr 2025, the 2026 values would need to exceed those specific 2025 values. The consistent 0.2-0.3°C deficit observed through early February suggests this is unlikely unless there's a dramatic shift in conditions. The ENSO transition provides some hope for March-April, but La Niña's suppressive effect will likely persist through most of the forecast period.

Outside view calibration:

Looking at the evidence:
- **Rough figure to tether to**: The agent report and question background both confirm 2026 is running 0.2-0.3°C below 2025 for corresponding days. This is a substantial and consistent deficit.
- **Base rate consideration**: In the 2023-2025 period, each year set numerous daily records. However, 2026 represents a different ENSO regime (La Niña vs the El Niño/neutral conditions of 2023-2025).
- **Probability calibration**: 
  - If 2026 were tracking equal to or above 2025, probability would be ~70-80% (high likelihood of at least one day setting a record)
  - With the consistent 0.2-0.3°C deficit, we need to estimate the chance of a sufficient warming surge
  - La Niña weakening in March-April provides ~20-30% of the forecast period with potentially more favorable conditions
  - Natural variability could produce brief spikes, but overcoming a 0.2-0.3°C systematic deficit is challenging

**Domain upset rate**: Climate and ocean temperature forecasting at 2-3 month lead times has moderate uncertainty. Unexpected events (volcanic eruptions, sudden circulation changes) can occur but are rare. The ENSO forecast itself has ~60-70% confidence.

**Probability reasoning**:
- Chance that La Niña weakening allows significant warming: ~25%
- Chance that natural variability produces a record-breaking spike despite La Niña: ~10%
- Chance of unexpected forcing or circulation change: ~5%
- Combined probability considering 78 days of opportunities: ~18-22%

This is not a 5% "very unlikely" scenario because of the elevated baseline and ENSO transition, but it's also not a 35%+ scenario given the consistent deficit and La Niña persistence through most of the period.
