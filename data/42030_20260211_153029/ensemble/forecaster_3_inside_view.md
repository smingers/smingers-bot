Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Resolves **Yes** if **any day from Feb 1, 2026 to Apr 30, 2026** has the **North Atlantic daily mean SST** (ClimateReanalyzer / NOAA OISST) **higher than that calendar day’s value in all other years**.

2) (a) Source analysis (quality + what is factual vs opinion)
- Copernicus / C3S “Surface air temperature for Jan 2026” (2026-02-10; primary institutional climate monitor; high quality).  
  *Facts:* Jan 2026 global SST (60S–60N) 20.68°C (4th highest Jan); weak La Niña; “large region” of subtropical/NE North Atlantic warmest for time of year (regional, not necessarily basin-mean).  
  *Opinions:* minimal; mostly descriptive.
- Xinhua via China.org.cn (2026-02-10; secondary reporting of Copernicus; medium quality but anchored to C3S).  
  *Facts:* repeats C3S rankings and anomalies.
- AskNews cluster (Yahoo/SRF/N-tv/ZEIT/euronews/Poder360 etc., 2026-02-10; mostly syndicated summaries of C3S; medium quality, redundant).  
  *Facts:* consistent with C3S; mentions record-high SSTs in parts of North Atlantic (e.g., Norwegian Sea).
- Daily Sabah on ocean heat content (2026-01-12; secondary reporting of a study; medium quality).  
  *Facts:* 2025 record ocean heat content; North Atlantic up to ~1.5°C above average in places (regional).  
  *Opinion:* framing about “hotspots,” but underlying claim plausibly grounded in published analyses.
- German BSH / Xinhua + RFI (2026-01-07; medium-to-high for regional seas).  
  *Facts:* North Sea 2025 record warmth; supports “background Atlantic-adjacent warmth,” but not directly basin-wide North Atlantic mean.
- Severe Weather Europe (2026-01-09; forecasting blog; mixed quality).  
  *Claims/opinion:* La Niña breakdown, possible El Niño later 2026; not directly informative for Feb–Apr North Atlantic basin mean SST.
- Weather.com seasonal outlook (2026-01-21; media interpretation of outlooks; low direct relevance).  
  *Facts/opinion:* US land temperature outlook; weak linkage to basin SST.
- Nature paper (2026-02-04; high quality research, but not directly predictive).  
  *Facts:* Atlantic SST anomalies matter for Arctic SIE; no direct Feb–Apr 2026 SST forecast.

Key “meta” fact from the platform prompt: **As of today (Feb 11), the criteria “have not yet been satisfied,”** implying **no daily record occurred Feb 1–Feb 10**. This is highly decision-relevant.

3) (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence (large shift potential)
- **Non-occurrence so far:** The question explicitly states criteria have not been satisfied as of Feb 11 → **first 10 eligible days already failed**. This meaningfully reduces the remaining chance vs an ex-ante Feb–Apr window.
- **ENSO state:** Multiple sources (Copernicus; general meteorological consensus) indicate **weak La Niña / transition toward neutral**. La Niña is typically less conducive than El Niño for extreme Atlantic basin-mean warmth (not deterministic, but a real base-rate drag).

Moderate evidence
- **Jan 2026 global SST is high but not record-level (4th for January)** (Copernicus). This supports “still warm,” but suggests we are not in the most extreme global surface regime (vs 2024/2025).
- **Copernicus notes record-warm *regions* in the North Atlantic for time of year** (Norwegian Sea / subtropical-NE Atlantic). This slightly increases the chance of a basin-mean daily record later, but regional records do not strongly imply basin-mean records.

Weak evidence
- **Longer-run ocean heat content records / shipping aerosol changes**: important for the elevated baseline, but they do not tightly determine whether **Feb–Apr 2026** exceeds **the already-extreme 2025 daily calendar-day records**.
- Media/seasonal outlook pieces focused on land temperatures (low direct mapping to basin mean SST record events).

4) (c) Timeframe analysis
- Eligible window: **Feb 1–Apr 30, 2026** (90 days total).  
- Remaining from today (Feb 11): **~79 days**.
How probability would change with different horizons:
- If the remaining horizon were **halved** (~40 days), chance of at least one record would fall materially (fewer “draws,” and less time for a regime shift), likely by several percentage points.
- If **doubled** (hypothetically extending into summer), probability would rise substantially because late spring/summer tends to allow larger sustained anomalies and more scope for marine heatwave development.

5) (d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside view)
Outside-view base rate given: **19%**.

Adjustments:
- Downward: **No record in the first 10 eligible days** is concrete and directly tied to resolution. If we think of “record occurrence” as clustered/regime-driven rather than independent daily trials, missing early February is informative that 2026 is not (yet) in a record-breaking basin-mean regime. (Moderate downward shift.)
- Downward: **La Niña/near-neutral** vs the record-favorable background of 2023–2025 reduces the likelihood of surpassing the very high 2025 calendar-day benchmarks. (Small-to-moderate downward shift.)
- Upward: **North Atlantic has notable record-warm regional pockets** even in Jan 2026 (Copernicus), and the long-run warming baseline remains high. This preserves a non-trivial tail risk of a short-lived basin-wide spike or a rapid onset marine heatwave in March–April. (Small upward shift.)

Net: modest reduction from 19%, not a collapse to near-zero, because (i) baseline warmth remains elevated and (ii) there is still ~79 days for a basin-wide anomaly event.

Probability calibration
- Status quo continuation (2026 running below 2025’s daily values): strongly points to **No**.
- Main “Yes” pathway: a **basin-scale** (not merely regional) late-winter/early-spring marine heatwave / atmospheric pattern yielding unusually weak winds + high insolation + warm advection, sufficient to exceed 2025’s calendar-day maxima for at least one day.
- My inside-view probability (balancing the already-failed Feb 1–10 period and La Niña drag against the still-high baseline): **16%**.

Checklist:
1. Criteria check: Yes if any day Feb 1–Apr 30, 2026 beats the same calendar day’s North Atlantic daily mean SST in all years.
2. Outside view base rate: 19%.
3. Consistency line: 16 out of 100 times, at least one day Feb 1–Apr 30, 2026 sets a new daily calendar-day North Atlantic SST record.
4. Key evidence (most significant):
   - Criteria not yet satisfied by Feb 11 → Feb 1–10 produced no record.
   - Weak La Niña/transition to neutral (Copernicus) generally dampens Atlantic record odds vs El Niño-boosted periods.
   - Jan 2026 global SST high but not record (4th), suggesting less extreme surface regime than 2024/2025.
   - Record-warm *regional* North Atlantic pockets (Copernicus) keep tail risk alive.
5. Blind spot: A rapid, basin-wide marine heatwave emergence in March–April (wind/cloud anomalies) could make “Yes” much more likely (would push me upward toward ~25–35%).
6. Status quo outcome: Most likely outcome is continued slightly-below-2025 daily values → No.

Probability: 16%
