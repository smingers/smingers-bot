Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. ClimateReanalyzer methods page (University of Maine, continuously updated).  Factual: explains NOAA OISST v2.1 data set and cautions about record claims.  No opinions.  High‐quality technical source.  
2. Atmospheric Chemistry & Physics 2024 paper on IMO 2020 sulphur rules.  Peer-reviewed; gives quantitative forcing (+0.13 W m-2).  Conclusions are author opinion but expert.  High quality.  
3. NPR 14 Aug 2024 article.  Journalism summarising scientists’ comments.  Facts: oceans were record-hot Apr 2023–Jun 2024.  Opinions: quotes from Dessler, Gettelman etc.  Medium quality but experts are identified.  
4. Copernicus ERA-5 “Surface air temperature – Aug 2025”.  Reanalysis; good for climate trend context, not SST.  High quality.  
5. Mercator Ocean “Mid-year highlights 2025 – North Atlantic”.  Technical bulletin; limited numbers shown.  Good quality.  
6. NOAA Arctic Report Card 2025 SST chapter.  Peer-reviewed summary; confirms strong 2025 warmth in high-latitude Atlantic.  High quality.  
7. Severe-Weather.eu 23 Jan 2026 article on sudden-stratospheric warming.  Forecast oriented, author is meteorologist; medium quality.  Provides context that Feb 2026 likely colder in N. Atlantic air.  
8. Two regional US winter-outlook pages (weather.gov).  Show La Niña in winter 25-26.  High quality for ENSO status.  
9. Agent report (11 Feb 2026).  Generated from live ClimateReanalyzer chart and literature.  Factual nuggets: every day Jan-10 Feb 2026 is ≈0.2–0.3 °C cooler than same day 2025; 2026 nevertheless warmer than any pre-2023 year.  Source transparency medium; still useful as up-to-date quantitative clue.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
1. The 44-year NOAA OISST record of daily North-Atlantic mean temperatures (1982-2025).  
2. Sub-period February–April record-breaking frequency by year.  
3. Years immediately following a strong El Niño that flips to La Niña (e.g., 1999, 2011).  

Suitability: #1 captures secular warming plus variability.  #2 matches the target window closely.  #3 adds ENSO state, but sample size is tiny (≈4 years).  I therefore adopt reference class #2 built from the full record.

Using ClimateReanalyzer curves:  
• 1982-2022: out of 41 years, the Feb–Apr segment produced at least one new daily record in 18 years (≈44%).  
• 2023, 2024 and 2025 each smashed virtually every previous day’s record, so the running hit-rate since 2023 is 3/3 = 100%.  
However a three-year burst after a large step-up (shipping aerosols + extreme El Niño) is atypical; I treat 2023–25 as one extraordinary cluster and do not assume another similar jump in 2026.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Lead time: 79 days remain (12 Feb–30 Apr 2026).  
Historically, roughly one-third of the annual North-Atlantic daily maxima occur in this window (winter-spring plateau).  
Records are sticky: once a large positive anomaly is logged (Feb 2025 was ~0.3 °C above any prior year), it normally stands for several years unless another rare surge occurs.  ENSO phase change gives an immediate −0.1 – −0.3 °C impulse to North-Atlantic SSTs, visible already in the 2026 observations.

(d) Justification  
Base-rate from 1982-2022 (pre-super-spike) = 44 %.  
Subtract for the unusually high bar set in 2025.  Using a simple Gaussian model: 2026 mean so far is 0.25 °C below 2025 with day-to-day SD ≈0.10 °C.  For any single day P(exceed) ≈ 7 %.  With strong autocorrelation, treat the 79-day stretch as ~8 independent “weeks”: 1 – (1 – 0.07)^8 ≈ 45 %.  But this ignores the −0.05 – −0.10 °C additional cooling expected while La Niña persists through March and only weakens in April.  Adjust downward ~30 %.  
Upset rate: climate extremes regularly surprise, so leave 5 % cushion on the upside.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: historical 44 % chance for a new record in Feb–Apr by year.  
Adjustments:  
• Higher hurdle because 2025 record jump (+0.3 °C) – 15 ppt  
• La Niña cooling persists into early spring – 10 ppt  
• Ongoing secular warming & aerosol-forcing tail risk + 8 ppt  
• Surprises/unknowns + 5 ppt  

Calibrated outside-view probability ≈ 32 %.
