Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Copernicus January-2026 bulletin (multiple news pick-ups, 10 Feb 2026).  Reanalysis data, high quality, no forecast.  Factual: global SST fourth-highest January, North Atlantic contained record-warm pockets but mean still 0.29 °C below Jan-2024.  
2. China.org.cn/Xinhua note (10 Feb 2026).  Same Copernicus numbers, reliable wire service.  Adds comment that Jan-2026 SST was 0.29 °C below 2024 record – useful factual datum.  
3. Severe-weather.eu blog (9 Jan 2026).  Medium quality.  Shows La Niña already weakening; transition to neutral expected late spring.  Provides ENSO context; partly speculative but directionally consistent with NOAA weekly ENSO update (not separately listed here).  
4. Nature paper (4 Feb 2026).  Peer-reviewed science but historic teleconnection study; no direct bearing on next 79 days.  Ignored for probability.  
5. Weather.com U.S. land forecast (21 Jan 2026).  Indirect evidence: implies hemispheric circulation warm-leaning Feb-Apr; weak link → treated as weak evidence.  
6. 2025-era articles on ocean heat content / North Sea records.  Provide structural context that North Atlantic has been on record-breaking path for several years.  Good quality, but dated (up to Oct 2025).  Help set the warming trend baseline.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Long-term warming trend of North-Atlantic SST (+≈0.04 °C yr⁻¹, multiple Copernicus/BSH/CMEMS reports).  
Moderate evidence  
• ENSO state: weak La Niña currently suppressing Atlantic SST by ≈0.2–0.3 °C (Copernicus Jan values + Severe-weather.eu discussion).  
• Seasonality: in every year 2016-2025 North-Atlantic warmed 0.25–0.45 °C between mid-Feb and early-Apr (ClimateReanalyzer archives) – historical pattern with predictive value.  
• Transition toward ENSO-neutral by April may remove some of the current headwind (ECMWF & ENSO outlooks – single reliable source each).  
Weak evidence  
• Regional cold snaps over Europe/US – limited influence on basin-wide SST.  
• Teleconnection research paper – not timescale-relevant.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Days to resolution: 79.  This window covers the climatological spring-rise phase when past records were set (late-Mar to mid-Apr).  
If the window were halved (≈40 days), probability would fall ~15 pp because most historic peaks arrive after mid-March.  
If doubled (to 160 days), probability would rise ~20 pp because the June-July spike is usually higher than spring even in cool years.

(d) Justification & inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (recent-decade 2016-2025): 70 %.  
Adjustments:  
– Current anomaly: Jan-2026 mean North-Atlantic SST 0.29 °C below Jan-2024 and ≈0.25 °C below Feb-2025 (strong head-wind).  Historical spring climb would have to erase this deficit and add a margin.  −15 pp.  
+ Background warming between 2025 and 2026 (≈0.04 °C) plus continuing aerosol-reduction forcing shrinks the deficit slightly.  +5 pp.  
– Weak La Niña still active through at least March; composite suggests 0.1–0.2 °C suppression versus neutral.  −5 pp.  
+ Rapid La Niña decay expected by April could allow unusually strong late-March warming pulse (moderate evidence). +3 pp.  
Net: 70 % –15 % +5 % –5 % +3 % = 58 %.

Status-quo (no big surprises) therefore implies a bit better than even-money chance, but lower than the 65 % outside view.

Probability calibration
I expect that in roughly 58 out of 100 years with today’s starting conditions and the current climate trend, the North-Atlantic daily SST would set a new record on at least one day between 1 Feb and 30 Apr.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: “Between 1 Feb and 30 Apr 2026, will any North-Atlantic daily-mean SST exceed the same calendar-day value from all previous years?”  
2. Outside-view base rate: 70 %.  
3. Consistency line: 58/100 times the record would be broken.  
4. Key evidence (each ≤20 words):  
   • Jan-2026 SST 0.29 °C below 2024 record (Copernicus).  
   • Spring climb historically adds 0.3–0.4 °C Feb-Apr.  
   • Weak La Niña currently suppresses Atlantic, forecast to fade by April.  
   • Structural 0.04 °C yr⁻¹ warming persists, plus lower-aerosol forcing.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden March marine heat-wave pushing SST up 0.6 °C in three weeks (as in 2023) would make 58 % look too low.  
6. Status-quo bias check: Starting below last year argues for slightly favouring ‘No’; kept probability just under 60 %.

Probability: 58%
