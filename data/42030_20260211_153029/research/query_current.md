Analysis:
The key to forecasting whether a new daily record will be set before May 2026 is (1) the current trajectory of North Atlantic SST anomalies in early-to-mid February 2026, (2) comparisons with the 2024–2025 record-holding values for the same calendar days, and (3) expert outlooks (e.g., NOAA, Copernicus, UK Met Office) for March–April 2026 that consider lingering El Niño warmth, shipping-aerosol effects, and possible volcanic forcing. Therefore, the most relevant articles or datasets are those giving up-to-date charts of daily SSTs, commentaries on whether 2026 has run below 2025 so far, and short-term forecasts or climate-model guidance for the coming 2-3 months.
