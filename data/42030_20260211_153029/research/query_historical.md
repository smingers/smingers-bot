Analysis:
To gauge whether a new daily record is likely before May 2026, I need (a) the level and trajectory of North Atlantic SSTs in early 2026, (b) the magnitude and timing of the 2025 and 2023–24 records to know what threshold must be surpassed, and (c) expert commentary on drivers such as lingering El Niño conditions, reduced shipping aerosols, and North Atlantic Oscillation variability. Relevant historical context therefore includes ClimateReanalyzer daily‐SST plots, climate-science articles reviewing the 2023–25 heat events, and news or blog updates discussing January–February 2026 SST anomalies.
