winter\n- Currently experiencing a weak La Ni\u00f1a pattern\n- Expected to transition to ENSO-neutral conditions soon\n- La Ni\u00f1a typically means warmer-than-average winters across the southern tier and cooler-than-average across the northern tier, but this pattern may not hold for the rest of winter due to the transition\n\n**Temperature Outlook (February-April 2026):**\n- **February:** Large swath of the country expected to see warmer-than-average temperatures; Northern Plains, Pacific Northwest, and northern New England will see slightly cooler-than-average temperatures; warm-up expected in later part of February\n- **March:** Similar temperature pattern to February, with cooler-than-average temperatures in northern parts of Northern Plains and Pacific Northwest\n- **April:** Entire East will experience warmer-than-average temperatures; warmest relative to average weather expected across Southwest and Southern Plains\n\n**Precipitation Outlook:**\n- Wetter-than-average conditions likely across northern U.S.\n- Drier-than-average conditions more likely across southern U.S.\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This article focuses on U.S. land temperature and precipitation forecasts

Climate Outlook across the eastern Carolinas\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Temperature Outlook:**\n- 40-50% chance that summer 2025 temperatures in the Carolinas will be among the warmest one-third of previously observed summer seasons\n- Spring 2025 (March-May) temperatures were unusually warm, with most local stations placing in the top 5 warmest spring seasons on record\n- Locally observed average summer temperatures over the past five years ranged from 0.7\u00b0F below normal (Florence, SC in 2023) to 1.2\u00b0F above normal (Wilmington, NC in 2022)\n- Each 1\u00b0F increase in average temperature roughly equals a 6% increase in energy costs\n\n**Global Context:**\n- 2023 and 2024 were the two warmest years in the modern record (since 1850)\n- 2025 may rank among the warmest observed years\n\n**Sea Surface Temperatures:**\n- Sea surface temperatures are above normal across most of the Atlantic Ocean, including the Gulf and Caribbean\n- Unusually warm sea surface temperatures along the Southeast coast were used as inputs to the forecast\n- Earlier negative temperature anomalies across the Atlantic's \"main development region\" (between African coast and Caribbean) have modified over the past month, with temperatures approaching normal\n\n**Hurricane Season Outlook:**\n- NOAA's official forecast: 13-19 named storms, 6-10 hurricanes, and 3-5 major hurricanes\n- These ranges are slightly above long-term averages (14 named storms, 7 hurricanes, 3 major hurricanes)\n- Warmer ocean water can enhance evaporation and allow tropical cyclones to produce heavier rainfall rates\n\n**ENSO Status:**\n- El Ni\u00f1o Southern Oscillation (ENSO) is in neutral phase as of April 2025\n- Neutral conditions expected to continue through summer months\n-

Begins: How a Major Pacific Flip will Reshape the 2026 Weather Patterns\"\n\n**Source:** Severe Weather Europe  \n**Date:** January 9, 2026  \n**Author:** Andrej Flis\n\n## Key Facts and Observations:\n\n**Current La Ni\u00f1a Status:**\n- La Ni\u00f1a has begun to break down rapidly across the tropical Pacific Ocean\n- Cold anomalies are weakening from the west\n- The La Ni\u00f1a event grew since late summer 2025, reaching a peak in late Fall 2025\n- The event is already starting to weaken, earlier than normal for such events\n- The atmospheric influence of La Ni\u00f1a is forecast to persist through early Spring 2026 over North America and Europe\n\n**Mechanism of Breakdown:**\n- A westerly wind burst in the western Pacific is dissipating the cold anomalies\n- ECMWF forecasts show westerly anomalies over the west-central ENSO regions in recent days\n- A \"proper Westerly Wind Burst\" is forecast for the second half of January 2026 across the western and central tropical Pacific\n- This is described as \"one of the strongest westerly wind bursts seen in recent years\"\n- The driver is a broad low-pressure area over the western Pacific forecast for mid-month\n\n**Ocean Temperature Changes:**\n- Latest 15-day ocean temperature change shows a warming trend in the western and central ENSO regions\n- ENSO region 4 (west) analysis shows La Ni\u00f1a cooling peaked in late November 2025, but the temperature anomaly has started to rise back rapidly since then\n- A large warm pool exists at 100-250 m (300-800 ft) depth in the western Pacific subsurface\n- This subsurface warm pool is expanding and eroding the La Ni\u00f1a below the surface\n- A strong subsurface warm pool is described as \"the first clear sign of an impending El Ni\u00f1o event\"\n\n**Future Forecast:**\n- A transition into a new El Ni\u00f1o event is forecast by Fall 2026\n- This would completely alter weather patterns for the 2026/2027 Winter season\n\n**Note:** The

daily record high before May 2026?\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**January 2026 Ranked Among Top 5 Warmest on Record but Was Exceptionally Cold in Europe**\nJanuary 2026 ranked among the top 5 warmest Januarys in global history, with an average global temperature 1.47\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\u20140.51\u00b0C higher than the 1991\u20132020 average, though 0.28\u00b0C below the record high set in January 2025. Despite this global warming trend, Europe experienced its coldest January since 2010, attributed to a disrupted polar jet stream that allowed Arctic air to flow into temperate latitudes. This phenomenon illustrates how global warming can intensify extreme weather, including cold waves. Temperature anomalies had diverse global impacts: widespread wildfires occurred in Australia, Chile, and Patagonia; severe rains and floods affected Mozambique; sea surface temperatures reached the fourth-highest level ever recorded, with record warming in the Norwegian Sea and parts of the Atlantic. In Ukraine, temperature anomalies were uneven: northern and eastern regions\u2014including Chernihiv, Kharkiv, Sumy, and Kyiv\u2014experienced temperatures 7.9\u20139\u00b0C below the 1991\u20132020 climate norm, while Lviv and Uzhhorod saw warming. Climatologists explained that Ukraine\u2019s position on the western edge of the cold air mass and the protective effect of the Carpathians contributed to milder conditions in the west. Arctic sea ice extent reached its third-lowest level in recorded history. Scientists warn that global temperatures may remain persistently above the 1.5\u00b0C threshold set by the Paris Climate Agreement in the coming years.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 05:20 PM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/ukraine/events/globalnaya-temperatura-v-yanvare-prevysila-normu-evropa-perezhila-samuyu-holodnuyu-zimu-50582747.html)\n\n**January 2026: Global Heat Record Amid Europe\u2019s Coldest January Since 2010**\nThe January 2026 global average temperature was 12.95\u00b0C, making it the 5th warmest January on record, behind 2025, 2024, 2020, and 2016, according to the Copernicus Climate Change Service. This marked a 1.47\u00b0C increase above the pre-industrial baseline (1850\u20131900).

The cold snap was driven by an unusually wavy polar jet stream, which allowed Arctic air to push into mid-latitudes, affecting North America, Europe, and Siberia. In Lapland, temperatures dropped below -30\u00b0C; Lappeenranta, Finland, recorded -31.5\u00b0C, its coldest night of winter. Norway saw temperatures over 10\u00b0C below normal, making it the 15th coldest January since 1901. Estonia faced its coldest January in 25 years, and Latvia recorded its strongest cold wave since February 2012. In Siberia and Russia, temperatures reached approximately -40\u00b0C. The U.S. saw extreme cold in the central and eastern regions, especially toward the end of the month, while the western U.S. and western Canada experienced warmer conditions. Globally, the 12-month period from February 2025 to January 2026 was 0.57\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 average and 1.45\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\u20140.19\u00b0C below the 2024 record anomaly of 0.76\u00b0C. Europe\u2019s 12-month average was 0.82\u00b0C above 1991\u20132020 but 0.85\u00b0C below its peak 12-month average (February 2024\u2013January 2025).

This marked the fifth-warmest January since record-keeping began, with the warmest January previously recorded in 2025. Despite extreme cold in parts of the Northern Hemisphere\u2014including a record-cold January in Europe, where temperatures averaged -2.34\u00b0C (1.63\u00b0C below average) and severe snowstorms in the U.S.\u2014the Southern Hemisphere experienced extreme heat, with wildfires in Australia and Chile and flooding in southern Africa. The global temperature anomaly was balanced by record-high sea surface temperatures (20.68\u00b0C, the fourth-highest on record for January), particularly in the North Atlantic, including the Norwegian Sea. Arctic sea ice extent was 6% below average, the third-lowest January value on record. In Western, Southern, and Eastern Europe, rainfall exceeded normal levels, causing floods and significant damage in Italy, the western Balkans, and the UK. Samantha Burgess of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts stated that January 2026 demonstrated how climate systems can produce simultaneous cold extremes and heatwaves, underscoring the need for adaptation to increasing climate risks. Copernicus data are derived from computer analyses integrating billions of satellite, ship, aircraft, and ground-based weather station measurements.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 02:02 AM\nSource:[inFranken.de](https://www.infranken.de/ueberregional/newsticker-national/wissenschaft/weltweit-fuenftwaermster-januar-der-geschichte-art-6320281)\n\n**World oceans reach record heat for 9th year in row**\nThe world's oceans reached a record heat content level in 2025, the ninth consecutive year of warming, according to an international study led by Lijing Cheng of the Chinese Academy of Sciences. Ocean heat content (OHC) in the upper 2,000 meters increased by 23 quadrillion megajoules compared to 2024, marking the highest level since records began in 1958. The study, published in 'Advances in Atmospheric Sciences' and based on three observational databases, shows that the rate of ocean heat accumulation has intensified since 1990, with an average increase of 0.14 watts per square meter per decade from 1960 to 2025, rising to 0.32 watts per square meter per decade from 2005 to 2025. While 2025 was the third warmest year on record for global sea surface temperatures\u20140.49\u00b0C above the 1981\u20132010 average\u2014regional anomalies were more pronounced: the North-West Pacific exceeded its long-term average by over 3\u00b0C, and the North Atlantic and Mediterranean were up to 1.5\u00b0C above average. The weakening of El Ni\u00f1o in 2025 contributed to the divergence between surface and deep-ocean temperature trends, with OHC being a more reliable indicator of long-term climate change due to its reduced sensitivity to short-term surface phenomena. The study links rising ocean heat to extreme weather events, including flash floods in Texas, South and South-East Asia, and West Africa, as well as heat domes in Europe with temperatures reaching 48\u00b0C (118.4\u00b0F) and widespread wildfires. The North Sea recorded its highest average surface temperature of 11.6\u00b0C in the BSH data series (since 1969), 0.9\u00b0C above the 1997\u20132021 average, while the Baltic Sea reached 9.7\u00b0C, 1.1\u00b0C above its long-term average, making 2025 the second warmest year on record for the region. The study identifies the North Atlantic and Mediterranean as climate change hotspots experiencing salinization, oxygen deficiency, and acidification, indicating a profound ecosystem destabilization.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 12, 2026 09:50 AM\nSource:[Daily Sabah](https://www.dailysabah.com/life/environment/world-oceans-reach-record-heat-for-9th-year-in-row)\n\n**North Sea Average Sea Surface Temperature Reaches Record High in 2025**\nAccording to a report released by the German Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency on January 7, 2026, the average sea surface temperature in the North Sea reached 11.6 degrees Celsius in 2025, marking the highest recorded value since 1969. The report states that this temperature was 0.9 degrees Celsius above the long-term average (1997\u20132021). All months in 2025 saw significantly higher sea surface temperatures than their historical averages, with June and December setting new records. The agency's president, Helge Hegerwald, stated that even if global greenhouse gas emissions were to stop immediately, sea levels are expected to continue rising for centuries, posing significant risks to coastal regions. He emphasized the need for strengthened climate governance to buy time for better adaptation and to protect coastal communities and infrastructure.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 07, 2026 10:12 PM\nSource:[\u65b0\u534e\u7f51](http://www.xinhuanet.com/20260107/1834903dd3b648e0985c659fb694f64d/c.html)\n\n**2025 warmest year on record in North Sea according to German maritime agency**\nGermany's Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) reported that the North Sea recorded its warmest year on record in 2025, with an average surface temperature of 11.6\u00b0C\u2014the highest since records began in 1969. The Baltic Sea followed closely, averaging 9.7\u00b0C, 1.1\u00b0C above its 1997\u20132021 mean and the second-highest since 1990. Seasonally, spring averaged 8.7\u00b0C (0.9\u00b0C above normal), the hottest since 1997, while summer reached 15.7\u00b0C\u2014surpassing 2003 and 2014 to become the warmest on record since 1969, with regional anomalies exceeding 2\u00b0C. A 55-day marine heatwave at Kiel Lighthouse (late March to May) was the longest on record since 1989, driven by reduced cloud cover, increased solar heating, and inflows of warm Atlantic water. These trends align with the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which notes oceans have absorbed over 90% of excess atmospheric heat since 1970, with warming rates more than doubling since 1993\u2014from 3\u20134 Zetajoules (ZJ) per year pre-1993 to over 6 ZJ annually thereafter. One ZJ equals the energy from 239 million Hiroshima bombs or global power consumption for a year. Marine heatwaves have doubled in frequency since 1982 and intensified globally. UNESCO\u2019s 2024 State of the Ocean report confirms ocean warming has doubled over two decades, contributing to a 2% deoxygenation since the 1960s, 30% acidification since pre-industrial times, and 40% of recent sea-level rise from thermal expansion. Warming threatens North Sea biodiversity, disrupting plankton, fish migration, and oxygen levels, creating 'dead zones' and stressing cold-adapted species; zooplankton collapses from 2018\u20132022 indicate future risks. Species shifts may benefit some sharks or oysters but risk invasive species and ecosystem imbalance. The Baltic Sea, warming nearly 2\u00b0C since 1990, faces heightened risks of seabed hypoxia. Coastal communities anticipate stronger storms and erosion due to sea-level rise and intensified weather patterns.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 07, 2026 01:21 PM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/en/environment/20260107-2025-warmest-year-on-record-in-north-sea-according-to-german-maritime-agency)\n\n**North Pacific Boiling This Summer: Climate Change Beyond Models \u2013 Mystery Behind Record Heat**\nThe North Pacific Ocean experienced its hottest summer on record from July to September 2024, according to the BBC, with sea surface temperatures surpassing previous highs. Data from the European Union\u2019s Copernicus climate monitoring program shows that the North Pacific sea surface temperature was 0.25\u00b0C higher than the previous record set in 2022. Despite climate change contributing to rising ocean temperatures, the 2024 August temperature was exceptionally high\u2014according to the Berkeley Earth Group\u2019s climate model, the likelihood of such a temperature occurring in any given year is less than 1%. While some suggest weaker winds contributed to the warming, the BBC notes this alone cannot explain the rapid increase. Several hypotheses have emerged: the International Maritime Organization\u2019s (IMO) 2020 regulation reducing sulfur content in ship fuel from 3.5% to 0.5% may have diminished sulfur aerosols that previously reflected sunlight and cooled the ocean, thereby exposing Earth\u2019s warming directly. Additionally, China\u2019s air pollution reduction efforts have decreased fine particulate matter (PM), which historically helped suppress sea surface warming, potentially unintentionally contributing to ocean heating. The BBC reports that the warming has already triggered record-breaking heatwaves in Japan and South Korea and powerful hurricanes in the U.S., and could affect weather in Europe and the UK this winter. Amanda Maycock, a climate science professor at the University of Leeds, warned that warm conditions in the North Pacific could influence North Atlantic and European weather, possibly bringing intense cold in early winter.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 10:18 AM\nSource:[\uc5f0\ud569\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.yna.co.kr/view/AKR20251018043000009)\n\n**New Report: Heatwaves and Rising Sea Levels**\nIn spring 2024, the average sea surface temperature reached a record high of 21\u00b0C, confirming the accelerating pace of global warming, according to data from the Copernicus Marine Service. The ocean heat content is increasing at a rate of 0.14 W/m\u00b2 per decade, with the north-eastern Atlantic warming more than twice as fast as the global average\u2014up by 0.27\u00b0C per decade. As reported by the Polish Press Agency, these processes are driving a steady rise in sea levels, fueled by both glacial melting and thermal expansion of seawater, representing one of the most serious challenges associated with climate change.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: October 03, 2025 12:23 PM\nSource:[tech.wp.pl](https://tech.wp.pl/nowy-raport-fale-upalow-i-wzrost-poziomu-morz,7206877588167552a)\n\n**Oceans Continue to Heat Up, Setting New Records in 2024**\nGlobal sea surface temperatures reached a record high of 21\u00b0C in spring 2024, according to data from 1982 onward. The Copernicus Marine Service reported that marine heatwaves in 2023 and 2024 were particularly intense and prolonged, affecting large portions of the oceans\u2014over 300 days in parts of the Atlantic in 2023 alone. Since the 1960s, ocean warming has accelerated, indicating a dangerous imbalance in Earth\u2019s systems due to climate change. The Baltic Sea is warming more than three times faster than the global average over a 30-year period, while the North Sea is warming at twice the global rate. In summer 2025, sea temperatures in the southwestern Baltic Sea, including German waters, were up to 1.5\u00b0C above the 1997\u20132021 average. Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research emphasized that ocean warming drives increased evaporation, leading to more extreme rainfall and flooding on land, and contributes to rising sea levels, exacerbating coastal flooding. The Copernicus Marine Service, part of the EU\u2019s Copernicus Earth observation program and funded by the European Commission, conducts ocean analyses and forecasts.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:40 AM\nSource:[Proplanta](https://www.proplanta.de/agrar-nachrichten/umwelt/ozeane-heizen-sich-weiter-auf_article1759290046.html)\n\n**The Exhausted Sea**\nThe article reports that climate change is rapidly altering European seas, with record\u2011warm summers in the North Sea and the Mediterranean, expanding marine heatwaves, and significant ice loss in the Arctic.  In summer\u202f2025 the North Sea\u2019s mean surface temperature reached 15.7\u202f\u00b0C, about 3\u202f\u00b0C above the long\u2011term average, and the BSH recorded a 55\u2011day marine heatwave at the Kiel lighthouse station \u2013 the longest since measurements began in 1969.  The Mediterranean averaged 26.9\u202f\u00b0C in July\u202f2025, the highest on record, and the Copernicus Marine Service noted that 65\u202f% of the basin\u2019s surface was affected by the strongest heatwave ever observed in July.  A meta\u2011analysis by Geomar\u2011Helmholtz\u2011Kiel found that a warming of only a few tenths of a degree can push seagrass beds, fish stocks and coastal habitats into high\u2011risk zones.  The article cites a 0.8\u202f\u00b0C additional warming scenario that could reduce fish stocks by 30\u201340\u202f%, threatening fisheries in Italy, Greece and Spain.  It also warns that the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) may weaken enough to reach a tipping point within two decades, with potential costs of several trillion euros by 2100, according to the Max\u2011Planck\u2011Gesellschaft.  Arctic sea\u2011ice volume has dropped by roughly 75\u202f% since the 1980s, and the recent winter showed an unusually low ice extent, signalling a rapid system shift.  The piece concludes that Europe must intensify marine\u2011heat\u2011wave early\u2011warning systems, adaptive fisheries management and nature\u2011based coastal protection, but stresses that without substantial emission cuts these measures will lag behind reality.  Key quotes include BSH\u2011referent Dagmar Kieke saying \u2018Wir sehen einen Zusammenhang mit einer ausgepr\u00e4gten marinen Hitzewelle vor Norwegen in diesem Sommer, die sich bis in die Nordsee hinein auswirkte\u2019 and Geomar scientist Abed El Rahman Hassoun warning \u2018Ohne deutlich mehr Erfolge beim Klimaschutz werden die Risiken so gro\u00df, dass sich die \u00d6kosysteme kaum anpassen k\u00f6nnen \u2013 jedes Zehntelgrad weniger z\u00e4hlt\u2019.
