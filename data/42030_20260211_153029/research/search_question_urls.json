It does not contain forecasts, opinions, or analysis relevant to predicting future sea surface temperature records.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/24/13681/2024/\">\n# Summary of \"Warming effects of reduced sulfur emissions from shipping\"\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Emissions and Regulations:**\n- The 2020 IMO regulation reduced sulfur content in shipping fuel, cutting sulfur emissions over global open oceans by approximately 80%\n- Ships emit around 10-13 Tg yr\u207b\u00b9 of sulfur dioxide (SO\u2082), accounting for about 14% of global SO\u2082 emissions from all sectors\n- Global shipping SO\u2082 emissions fell from 10.1 Tg SO\u2082 (14% of anthropogenic emissions) in 2015 to 2.1 Tg (4%) in 2020\n- The regulation reduced maximum fuel sulfur content from 3.5% to 0.5% of fuel mass outside special emission control areas\n\n**Climate Forcing and Temperature Impacts:**\n- Global aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) from reduced shipping emissions: 0.13 W m\u207b\u00b2 (with interannual standard deviation of 0.016)\n- This forcing is equivalent to an additional ~50% on top of the net positive forcing from the reduction in all anthropogenic aerosols from the late-20th century to the pre-2020 era\n- Based on comparison to Smith et al. (2021), which estimates 1990-2020 aerosol ERF of 0.25 W m\u207b\u00b2\n- Global mean sulfate aerosol column burden reduction: 0.14 mg m\u207b\u00b2, corresponding to 4.6% decrease\n\n**Predicted Warming (from HadGEM3-GC3.1-LL climate model ensembles, 2020-2049):**\n- Global mean warming: 0.04 K averaged over 2020-2049 period\n- Arctic warming: 0.15 K Arctic-wide mean\n- Atlantic sector of the Arctic: 0.3 K (representing >10% increase in total anthropogenic warming since pre-industrial times)\n- Statistically significant warming predicted in 2030s and 2040s in: tropical eastern Indian Ocean to western Pacific Ocean region, around the Mediterranean, eastern North America, and Atlantic Ocean north of 60\u00b0N\n\n**Regional Sulfate Burden Reductions:**\n- Strongest reductions in large coastal region of Southeast Asia, followed by Mediterranean and Arabian Peninsula\n- Large reductions over eastern tropical Atlantic, Europe and north Africa, tropical Indian Ocean, and West Pacific\n\n## Study Methodology:\n\n- Used HadGEM3-GC3.1-LL climate model with 12-member ensembles\n- Two scenarios compared: SHIP20 (with 2020 emission reductions) vs SHIP100 (counterfactual with 2015 emission levels maintained)\n- Simulations run from 2015-2049\n- ERF estimated from 9-year global atmosphere-only UKESM1 simulations (2015-2023) nudged to ERA-Interim analysis data\n\n## Key Interpretations from Authors:\n\nThe authors state: \"the impact of shipping emission reductions either will have already committed us to warming above the 1.5 K Paris target or will represent an important contribution that may help explain part of the rapid jump in global temperatures over the last 12 months\" (note: this refers to the 12 months prior to publication)\n\nThe simulations are \"not clear on whether the global impact is yet to emerge or has already emerged because the present-day impact is masked by variability\"\n\nThe warming pattern shows features resembling La Ni\u00f1a, with warming in tropical eastern Indian Ocean to western Pacific and cooling in central to eastern Pacific, associated with strengthening of Walker circulation.\n\n**Note:** The article content appears to have been cut off mid-sentence at the end of the extraction.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/14/nx-s1-5051849/hot-oceans-climate-science\">\n# Summary of NPR Article: \"The oceans are weirdly hot. Scientists are trying to figure out why\"\n\n**Date:** August 14, 2024  \n**Author:** Rebecca Hersher\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- Worldwide average ocean temperatures were in record-breaking territory for 15 months straight starting from April 2023\n- Ocean water near Florida was so warm it was threatening coral reefs as of August 2024\n- New international shipping regulations went into effect in 2020, requiring ships to use cleaner fuel with less sulfur pollution\n- The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption occurred in 2022 off the coast of Tonga\n- The sun's energy output varies by about 0.1% over its 11-year solar cycle, causing Earth's global temperatures to change by a little less than 0.1 degree Celsius\n\n## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):\n\n**Andrew Dessler (climate scientist, Texas A&M):**\n- Identified climate change and El Ni\u00f1o as the two primary causes of ocean warming\n- Noted that oceans are even warmer than expected from these two trends alone\n- Was \"very skeptical\" of the volcanic warming effect theory\n- Suspects \"internal variability\" (natural climate weirdness) may account for some of the extra warming\n- States: \"The next few months will tell us if we've really broken the climate\"\n\n**Stephen Smith (air pollution and climate change expert, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory):**\n- Confirmed that cleaner shipping fuel \"saves lives\" by reducing harmful air pollution\n- Noted that sulfur pollution helps clouds form, and these clouds reflect sunlight\n\n**Andrew Gettelman (climate scientist, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory):**\n- Co-authored a forthcoming study finding that without reflective ship track clouds, more of the sun's energy reaches the ocean surface\n- States this \"could be contributing to the warm temperatures we've seen in the last couple years\"\n- Notes \"We're going to see the planet warm in fits and starts\"\n- Mentions there was a period in the 2010s when Earth didn't warm very much\n- States: \"I think people are starting to get a little worried that we are warming at the high end of what [climate models predicted]\"\n\n**Gregory Kopp (solar physicist, University of Colorado, Boulder):**\n- Definitively states: \"The sun isn't causing the recent record-breaking sea-surface temperatures\"\n- Explains the ocean is too large to immediately respond to solar cycle changes\n\n## Theories Examined:\n\n1. **Climate change and El Ni\u00f1o** (confirmed contributors)\n2. **Cleaner shipping fuel** (likely contributor) - Reduced sulfur pollution means fewer reflective clouds, allowing more solar heat to reach oceans\n3. **Hunga Tonga volcanic eruption** (ruled out as significant contributor) - Despite releasing water vapor (a greenhouse gas), it changed total atmospheric water very little\n4. **Solar activity** (ruled out) - Ocean too large to respond on short solar-cycle timescales\n5. **Natural variability/\"weirdness\"** (possible contributor) - Normal year-to-year temperature fluctuations\n\n## Key Concern:\n\nScientists are monitoring whether oceans cool off in coming months. If they don't, this would suggest Earth is heating up at the high end of climate model predictions.\n</QuestionSource>\n"
