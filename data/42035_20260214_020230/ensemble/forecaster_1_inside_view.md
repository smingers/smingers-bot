## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**

1. **Historical baseline (multiple sources confirm):** 2014 first-round abstention 38.7%, representing pre-COVID "normal." 2020 was 55.3%, but COVID-specific factors (39% of abstentionists) account for ~16-18 points of the increase. **Direction:** Suggests reversion toward 40-45% range, not full return to 38.7% due to structural factors.

2. **Expert consensus range (Interior Ministry, CEVIPOF via outside view):** Projections 40-50%, with Interior Ministry 40-43%, CEVIPOF 46-49%. **Direction:** Strongly supports 42-48% central range.

3. **Structural disaffection persistence (Bréchon analysis, multiple sources):** 61% of 2020 abstentionists cited non-COVID reasons. 2024 political crisis (dissolution, hung parliament) has worsened climate. **Direction:** Upward pressure vs 2014 baseline, supports 42-48% vs simple reversion to 38-40%.

**Moderate Evidence:**

4. **Urban-rural divide (Kraus/IFOP, multiple local examples):** Large cities consistently show 10-20 points higher abstention than small communes. Marseille 67% (2020), Loire-Atlantique cities >70% vs rural areas 40-50%. **Direction:** National average will reflect this mix, but doesn't independently predict direction.

5. **Destin Commun survey (Feb 3, 2026 article):** 60% of French already resolved to vote. **Direction:** Suggests 40% potential abstention floor, but survey timing (early) and methodology unknown limit reliability.

6. **Municipal council confidence (Actu.fr Feb 12):** 58% French confidence in municipal councils. **Direction:** Modest downward pressure on abstention vs other elections, but doesn't override structural trends.

**Weak Evidence:**

7. **Local candidate anecdotes (Marseille, Évry):** Mixed signals - some enthusiasm (Amrani), some concern (Beaudet, Monier). **Direction:** Neutral, too localized and contradictory.

8. **Procedural reforms (uniform proportional list, PLM changes):** CEVIPOF estimates -1 point participation effect, but uncertain. **Direction:** Slight upward pressure on abstention, but minimal.

9. **Competitive races (Paris, Lyon):** May drive local interest but no evidence of national spillover. **Direction:** Neutral to slight downward pressure, highly uncertain.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 30 days (Feb 13 to March 15, 2026)

**Current trajectory:** No national polls yet available. Expert projections made months ago (Interior Ministry working note, CEVIPOF scenarios). Local indicators mixed. 30 days is sufficient for:
- National polling to emerge (IFOP/Ipsos promised "late February")
- Campaign mobilization effects
- Weather/events to impact turnout

**If timeframe halved (15 days):** Would increase uncertainty significantly - less time for mobilization, higher risk of status quo (recent local trends) dominating. Might widen distribution by 2-3 points on tails.

**If timeframe doubled (60 days):** Would allow clearer trend identification through polling, potentially narrowing distribution by 1-2 points as uncertainty resolves.

**Historical pattern:** Municipal elections see late crystallization. 30 days is typical for campaigns to intensify. Not expecting major structural shifts, but mobilization effects could move outcome 2-4 points in either direction.

## (d) Justification

**Outside view established:** 10th: 39.5%, 20th: 41.5%, 40th: 44%, 60th: 46.5%, 80th: 48.5%, 90th: 51%

**Key adjustments from current evidence:**

1. **Expert consensus alignment (Strong):** Interior Ministry (40-43%) and CEVIPOF (46-49%) bracket suggests my outside view 40th-80th range (44-48.5%) is well-calibrated. No major shift needed.

2. **Structural persistence confirmation (Strong):** Multiple sources confirm 2024 political crisis has worsened climate. Bréchon's 61% non-COVID abstentionists, Kerrouche's paradox observation, and lack of any positive mobilization signals support staying above 2014's 38.7%. Justifies maintaining 42-48% central range vs optimistic 38-40% reversion.

3. **Urban concentration risk (Moderate):** Marseille (67%), Loire-Atlantique cities (>70%), Évry (72.89%) show extreme urban abstention persists. With continued urbanization, national average could skew higher. Supports maintaining right-skew with 90th at 51% vs tightening to 49%.

4. **Destin Commun 60% resolved to vote (Moderate):** If accurate, suggests 40% abstention floor, which aligns with optimistic Interior Ministry projection. Supports 10th percentile at 39.5% (not lower).

5. **No polling data yet (Weak but important):** Absence of national polls 30 days out increases uncertainty. Justifies maintaining wide 10th-90th spread (39.5-51% = 11.5 points) vs narrowing to 8-9 points.

**Shifts from outside view:**
- **10th percentile:** 39.5% → **40%** (Destin Commun floor + expert minimum)
- **20th-40th:** Maintain 41.5-44% (aligns with Interior Ministry optimistic)
- **60th:** 46.5% → **47%** (CEVIPOF central + structural factors)
- **80th-90th:** 48.5-51% → **49-52%** (urban risk + uncertainty + right-skew)

Distribution calibration:

**Central tendency:** The evidence strongly supports a 43-47% central range, representing:
- Significant reversion from 2020's COVID-driven 55.3%
- But elevated above 2014's 38.7% due to structural deterioration
- Alignment with expert consensus (40-50%)

**Right-skew justification:** 
- Structural factors (political disaffection, urbanization) create higher risk of unexpectedly high abstention
- No strong countervailing mobilization signals
- Uncertainty from lack of polling data
- Historical precedent: 2020 showed upside surprise potential

**Tail calibration:**
- **10th (40%):** Requires strong mobilization, competitive races driving turnout, favorable weather, minimal reform confusion. Possible but optimistic given current climate.
- **90th (52%):** Requires continued disaffection, poor weather, reform confusion, potential late political crisis. Within historical range (2020 was 55.3%) but unlikely absent major shock.

**Distribution shape:**
- 10th-40th: 8-point spread (40-48%) captures optimistic to central scenarios
- 40th-60th: 4-point spread (44-47%) tight clustering around most likely
- 60th-90th: 5-point spread (47-52%) wider to reflect right-skew risk

**Sensitivity check:**
- Shifting all percentiles +2 points (42-54% range) would imply structural factors fully persist from 2020 - not supported by COVID removal
- Shifting all percentiles -2 points (38-50% range) would imply full reversion to pre-2020 - contradicts expert consensus and structural evidence
- Current calibration balances these extremes appropriately

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** National abstention rate (% of registered voters not voting) in first round, March 15, 2026, per Interior Ministry.

2. **Outside view base rate:** 10th: 39.5%, 20th: 41.5%, 40th: 44%, 60th: 46.5%, 80th: 48.5%, 90th: 51%. My final prediction shifts slightly higher (40-52% vs 39.5-51%) based on structural factor confirmation and expert consensus alignment.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median ≈46%, mean ≈46.5%. This makes sense: significantly above 2014 (38.7%), well below 2020 (55.3%), aligned with expert projections (40-50%), reflects structural deterioration without COVID shock.

4. **Key evidence pieces:**
   - 2014 baseline 38.7%, 2020 COVID-adjusted suggests 45-47% structural level (VERIFIED: multiple sources)
   - Expert consensus 40-50% with Interior Ministry 40-43%, CEVIPOF 46-49% (VERIFIED: outside view agent report)
   - 61% of 2020 abstentionists cited non-COVID factors; 2024 crisis worsened climate (VERIFIED: Bréchon analysis, multiple sources)
   - Urban areas show 10-20 points higher abstention; continued urbanization (VERIFIED: Kraus/IFOP, local data)
   - No national polling yet 30 days out increases uncertainty (VERIFIED: multiple sources note absence)

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** A major political event in final 2 weeks (government collapse, major scandal, terrorism) could spike abstention to 54-56%, making my 90th (52%) look too conservative. Would push outcome UP.

6. **Status quo outcome:** 2020's 55.3% is not status quo due to COVID. True status quo is pre-COVID trend (38.7% in 2014 + structural increase). My prediction (median 46%) represents modest increase from that baseline, appropriate given 30-day timeframe and structural factors.
