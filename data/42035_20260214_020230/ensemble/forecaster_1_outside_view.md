Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles:**

1. **Le Monde (30 Jan 2026)** - Paris mayoral race article. Factual data on LFI's electoral performance (2022 presidential: 30% in Paris; 2024 parliamentary: 4/18 constituencies). Opinion from Chikirou on strategy. Recent and reliable for Paris-specific context but no national abstention data.

2. **Fondapol (2014)** - Historical abstention data from 1959-2014. Provides crucial baseline: average first-round abstention 26.5% (1959-2014). Factual, authoritative source (major French political foundation), but dated before recent trends.

3. **The Conversation (6 July 2020)** - Academic analysis by Pierre Bréchon (named expert). Key facts: 2020 first round 55.3% abstention (+18.8 points vs 2014); 39% of abstentionists cited COVID as primary reason; 61% cited other structural factors. High-quality academic source with clear attribution.

4. **Sciences Po CEVIPOF** - Research methodology description, no abstention data. Describes infrastructure for measuring attitudes during COVID but not directly relevant to forecasting.

5. **Le Monde Décodeurs (15 March 2020)** - Real-time 2020 results reporting. Factual: 55.36% abstention confirmed by Interior Ministry. Expert opinion from Frédéric Dabi (IFOP) on "double abstention" phenomenon. Reliable primary source.

6. **Pokaa (15 Sept 2025)** - Local Strasbourg poll (614 voters, commissioned by candidate). Low reliability for national trends; small sample, commissioned by interested party, 6 months before election.

7. **Le HuffPost (mid-Jan 2026)** - Compilation of local polls across France. No national abstention projections. Useful for understanding that municipal elections follow local logic, but no quantitative national data.

8. **Le Parisien (4 Feb 2026)** - Évry-Courcouronnes local analysis. Factual: 72.89% local abstention in 2020 vs 53.5% national. Opinions from local candidates (Monier, Amrani, Beaudet) expressing concern about abstention. Recent but purely local focus.

**Agent Report:**

Comprehensive historical data compilation:
- **Factual Interior Ministry data (1977-2020):** 1977: 21.6%, 1983: 21.7%, 1989: 30.9%, 1995: 30.6%, 2001: 33.7%, 2008: 33.5%, 2014: 38.7%, 2020: 55.3%
- **Expert projections for 2026:** Interior Ministry working note (40-43%), CEVIPOF scenario (46-49%), minority view (≈50%)
- **Reform impacts:** Uniform proportional list estimated at -1 point participation effect; PLM reform effects uncertain
- **Critical gap:** No national polls published yet as of mid-February 2026

The agent report provides the most comprehensive factual foundation, citing official sources and distinguishing clearly between data and expert speculation.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **All French municipal elections 1977-2020** - Broadest class, captures long-term trends but includes very different political eras and voting systems.

2. **Post-2000 municipal elections (2001, 2008, 2014, 2020)** - More recent period with similar political fragmentation and declining civic participation. Shows steady increase from 33.7% (2001) to 38.7% (2014).

3. **Pre-COVID trend (2001-2014)** - Excludes the 2020 anomaly. Shows gradual increase: 33.7% → 33.5% → 38.7%, suggesting a baseline around 38-42% for "normal" conditions.

4. **2020 adjusted for COVID effect** - If 39% of 2020's 55.3% abstention was COVID-driven, removing that effect suggests ≈45-47% baseline for 2020 under normal circumstances.

**Most suitable reference class:** Post-2000 elections (2001-2014), excluding the COVID-anomalous 2020, while acknowledging structural factors that persisted from 2020. This captures:
- Modern political fragmentation
- Declining local attachment
- Urbanization effects
- Recent institutional context

However, we must adjust upward from the 2014 baseline (38.7%) because:
- Structural disaffection factors identified in 2020 (61% of abstentionists) remain
- 2024 political crisis (dissolution, hung parliament) has worsened political climate
- New procedural changes may have small negative effects

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 30 days (from Feb 13 to March 15, 2026)

**Historical pattern over similar periods:**
- Municipal elections historically see late crystallization of interest
- No national polls yet available (IFOP/Ipsos promised "late February")
- Local candidates report mixed signals: some enthusiasm (Amrani in Évry), some concern (Beaudet, Monier)
- 30 days is too short for major structural shifts but sufficient for campaign mobilization effects

**Trend analysis (1977-2020):**
- Long-term upward trend in abstention: from ≈22% (1977-1983) to ≈34% (2001-2008) to 38.7% (2014)
- Average increase per cycle (6 years): ≈1.5-2 percentage points
- 2020 was a 16.6-point jump (55.3% vs 38.7%), but 39% was COVID-specific
- Structural component of 2020 increase: ≈10 points attributable to non-COVID factors

## (d) Justification

**Base rate from pre-COVID trend:** The 2014 first-round abstention was 38.7%. The long-term trend (2001-2014) showed gradual increases of 1-2 points per cycle.

**Adjustments for 2026:**

*Upward pressures (higher abstention):*
1. **Structural disaffection:** Bréchon's analysis shows 61% of 2020 abstentionists cited non-COVID reasons (political disgust, indifference). The 2024 political crisis (dissolution, hung parliament, government instability) has likely worsened this.
2. **Continued demographic trends:** Younger cohorts (born 1960s+) participate less; urbanization continues (higher abstention in large cities).
3. **Procedural changes:** CEVIPOF estimates uniform proportional list reform could reduce participation by ≈1 point; PLM double-ballot may confuse some voters.
4. **Expert consensus:** Most projections range 40-50%, with Interior Ministry (40-43%), CEVIPOF (46-49%), and minority views (≈50%).

*Downward pressures (lower abstention):*
1. **No COVID factor:** Removes the single largest driver of 2020's extreme result.
2. **Competitive races:** Open contests in Paris, Lyon, and other major cities may drive interest.
3. **Local mobilization:** Some candidates report door-to-door enthusiasm (Amrani).

**Synthesis:** 
The most likely outcome is a partial reversion toward pre-COVID levels, but not a complete return to 2014. The structural factors that drove non-COVID abstention in 2020 (political disaffection, generational change) have intensified with the 2024 crisis. A reasonable central estimate would be 42-47%, representing:
- Reversion from 2020's 55.3%
- But elevated above 2014's 38.7% due to structural deterioration
- Consistent with expert projections (40-50% range)

**Uncertainty factors:**
- No national polls yet available
- Unknown mobilization effects in final month
- Unclear impact of new voting procedures
- Potential for late-breaking political events

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring to established distributions:**
- Historical range (1977-2020): 21.6% to 55.3%
- "Normal" range (2001-2014): 33.5% to 38.7%
- Expert projections for 2026: 40% to 50%

**Distribution shape considerations:**
The distribution should be:
1. **Centered around 44-46%** - midpoint between optimistic reversion (40-43%) and pessimistic structural persistence (46-50%)
2. **Right-skewed** - higher risk of unexpectedly high abstention than unexpectedly low, given:
   - Structural factors persist
   - Political climate remains poor
   - Reform effects uncertain
3. **Wide tails** - significant uncertainty due to:
   - No national polling data yet
   - 30 days allows for mobilization surprises
   - Unknown effects of new procedures

**Tail calibration:**
- **10th percentile (optimistic):** Strong mobilization, competitive races drive turnout, minimal reform impact → 39-40%
- **90th percentile (pessimistic):** Continued disaffection, poor weather, reform confusion, political crisis → 50-52%

**Historical upset rate:** Municipal elections have shown surprises (2020's jump), but typically within predictable ranges except for exogenous shocks. The 2014→2020 jump was unprecedented. Absent COVID-level disruption, expect outcomes within expert-projected ranges.

**Percentile spacing:**
- 10th-40th: Gradual increase (optimistic to central-low scenarios)
- 40th-60th: Tight clustering around most likely outcome (44-46%)
- 60th-90th: Wider spacing to account for right-skew risk

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 39.5
Percentile 20: 41.5
Percentile 40: 44.0
Percentile 60: 46.5
Percentile 80: 48.5
Percentile 90: 51.0
