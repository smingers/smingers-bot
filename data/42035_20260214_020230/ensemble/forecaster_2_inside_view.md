Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical/Official Sources:**
1. **Fondapol chart (1959-2014)**: Primary source showing historical abstention rates. High quality, factual data from Interior Ministry records.
2. **INSEE series (2014, 2020)**: Official government statistics. 2014 first round: 36.45% abstention; 2020 first round: 55.3% abstention. Highest quality factual data.
3. **Multiple 2020 sources** (Le Monde, The Conversation): Confirm 55.3% first-round abstention with expert analysis attributing ~39% of abstentionists to COVID fears (IFOP/Ipsos surveys). Factual figures are reliable; expert opinions are from identifiable sources (Frédéric Dabi/IFOP, Pascal Perrineau).

**Recent News Articles (2026):**
1. **IFOP poll analysis (Feb 9, 2026)** - Frédéric Dabi interview: Expert opinion on Paris race uncertainty and potential for "differential mobilization." Notes tension between political disillusionment and respect for local officials. Moderate quality - expert opinion but Paris-specific.

2. **DNA/Lalsace (Jan 24, 2026)** - Éric Kerrouche (Sciences Po Cevipof): Notes paradox of rising abstention despite mayor popularity. Expert opinion, factual on trend but no specific 2026 prediction.

3. **Actu.fr (Feb 12, 2026)**: Reports 2020 abstention (55.3% first round, 58% second round) and notes 2014 baseline (60% participation = 40% abstention). Cites "Destin commun" study showing 60% of citizens resolved to vote in 2026. Mixed quality - factual on history, weak evidence on 2026 intent.

4. **Regional articles** (Ouest France, Ladepeche, etc.): Report local 2020 rates varying from 29.55% (Luxe-Sumberraute) to 77% (Marseille neighborhoods). Factual but highly variable by locality.

5. **CNEWS (Feb 1, 2026)**: Reports 2020 participation 44.66% first round (= 55.34% abstention), 41.86% second round. Confirms historical context. Factual.

6. **LaProvence (Feb 2, 2026)** - François Kraus (IFOP): Expert opinion that large cities consistently show higher abstention than small communes. Cites 2014 data showing 41% abstention in Aix vs. 16% in small communes. Strong evidence of structural pattern.

7. **Marseille-specific (Feb 5, 2026)**: Reports 67% Marseille abstention in 2020 vs. 58% national average. Some neighborhoods 80%+. Anecdotal evidence of continued disillusionment but also determination to vote. Weak evidence for national prediction.

**Key Factual Findings:**
- 2020: 55.3% abstention (COVID-affected)
- 2014: 36.45% abstention (last "normal" election)
- Historical trend: 27.2% (1989) → 38.7% (2014), generally rising except 2008
- Urban-rural gap: Large cities show 10-25pp higher abstention
- Expert consensus: 2020 was anomalous; question is whether return to 38-42% range or structural shift upward

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Historical trend line (1989-2014)**: Multiple official sources confirm steady rise from ~27% to ~39%, approximately +1pp per 6-year cycle. This establishes baseline expectation around 40-42% for 2026 absent other factors.
2. **COVID impact quantification**: IFOP/Ipsos surveys (identifiable expert sources) attribute ~39% of 2020 abstentionists specifically to coronavirus fears, suggesting ~6pp of the 15pp spike was virus-specific and should disappear.
3. **Urban concentration effect**: François Kraus (IFOP) confirms structural pattern of higher abstention in large cities. With new PLM system potentially increasing engagement in Paris/Lyon/Marseille, could marginally reduce national rate.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Post-2020 political climate**: 2022 legislative (52% abstention) and 2024 snap elections (55% abstention) show sustained high disengagement above pre-COVID levels, suggesting +3-5pp structural increase beyond trend.
2. **New electoral system**: Uniform proportional lists now apply to all communes. Could marginally increase participation in small communes (previously panachage) but effect size uncertain. Estimated ±1pp.
3. **"Destin commun" study**: 60% resolved to vote suggests 40% abstention, but this is stated intent 1+ months out, historically unreliable (±5pp from actual).

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Mayor popularity paradox**: Kerrouche notes mayors remain popular despite rising abstention. Suggests popularity doesn't translate to turnout. Anecdotal, no predictive power.
2. **Campaign intensity**: Paris race described as "open" and "uncertain" might drive local turnout, but Paris represents <5% of national electorate.
3. **Regional anecdotes**: Varied local reports (63% abstention in some communes, 29% in others in 2020) show high variance but limited national predictive value.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Time to resolution**: 31 days (March 15, 2026 first round)

**If timeframe halved (15 days)**: Minimal change. Municipal elections show little late-campaign volatility historically. Most turnout is determined by structural factors (local attachment, political efficacy) rather than last-minute events. Perhaps tighten distribution by ~1pp.

**If timeframe doubled (60 days)**: Slightly wider distribution to account for potential macro shocks (security incident, major scandal, economic crisis). Historical precedent shows such events can move turnout ±2-3pp. Would widen 10th/90th by ~2pp each direction.

**Current assessment**: One month is sufficient for campaign dynamics to be largely set. Weather on election day and final week news could cause ±1-2pp variation but unlikely to fundamentally shift the range.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view baseline**: 43% (μ), σ ≈ 4pp, yielding 10th: 37%, 90th: 52%

**Adjustments based on current evidence:**

1. **Downward pressure (-1 to -2pp)**: 
   - New PLM voting system may increase engagement in major cities, which historically show highest abstention
   - "Destin commun" study showing 60% intent to vote (though with high uncertainty)
   - Absence of COVID health crisis removes the single largest 2020 driver

2. **Upward pressure (+1 to +2pp)**:
   - Sustained high abstention in 2022-2024 national elections suggests structural shift
   - Political climate described as "terrible" since 2024 dissolution
   - Expert consensus (Dabi, Kerrouche) notes continued political disillusionment
   - However, local elections historically more resilient to national malaise

3. **Net assessment**: The evidence suggests a modest downward shift of ~1-2pp from the outside view baseline. The removal of COVID fears is the strongest factor, partially offset by general political disengagement. The new electoral system provides minor downward pressure.

**Revised central tendency**: 41-42% (vs. 43% outside view)

**Uncertainty considerations**:
- Lower bound: Very unlikely to drop below 35% given sustained structural factors and 2014 baseline of 36.45%. Even best-case scenarios (high engagement, good weather, compelling local races) wouldn't push below mid-30s.
- Upper bound: Could reach 50%+ if political disillusionment from 2024 fully carries over, but multiple experts suggest local elections remain more participatory. 2020's 55% required extraordinary circumstances unlikely to repeat.

## Distribution Calibration

**Central tendency reasoning**: 
- 2014 baseline: 36.45%
- Trend extrapolation: +1pp per cycle → ~40%
- Post-2020 structural increase: +2-3pp → 42-43%
- COVID removal: -1pp → 41-42%
- New system/local resilience: -1pp → 40-41%

**Target median**: 41%

**Distribution shape**: 
- Slightly right-skewed to account for risk of sustained high abstention
- Wider upper tail than lower tail (easier to imagine 50% than 32%)
- 80% confidence interval roughly 38-46% (8pp range)

**Percentile calibration**:
- **10th percentile (37%)**: Optimistic scenario - strong local engagement, new system works, weather favorable, compelling races. Just above 2014 level.
- **20th percentile (39%)**: Mild improvement over trend, some benefit from COVID removal
- **40th percentile (40.5%)**: Slightly below median, near trend-line expectation
- **60th percentile (42%)**: Slightly above median, incorporates some structural disengagement
- **80th percentile (45%)**: Pessimistic scenario - political malaise carries over strongly, low engagement
- **90th percentile (49%)**: Very pessimistic - approaching but not reaching 2020 levels, would require significant negative shock

**Sensitivity check**: Shifting percentiles by ±10% relative value:
- 10th at 33% seems too optimistic (would require unprecedented reversal)
- 10th at 41% seems too pessimistic (overlaps with median)
- 90th at 44% seems too confident (insufficient tail risk)
- 90th at 54% seems too pessimistic (would require COVID-level event)
- Current calibration feels appropriate

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: National abstention rate (% of registered voters not voting) in first round, March 15, 2026, per Interior Ministry.

2. **Base rate**: Outside view: 43% median, 10th: 37%, 90th: 52%. My forecast shifts down ~2pp due to COVID removal and new system, maintaining similar spread.

3. **Consistency**: Implied median = 41%; mean ≈ 41.5%. This aligns with trend extrapolation plus modest structural increase minus COVID effect. Reasonable.

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - 2014 baseline 36.45%; 2020 COVID-affected 55.3% (factual, official)
   - IFOP survey: ~39% of 2020 abstentionists cited COVID (expert, quantified)
   - 2022-2024 elections show sustained 52-55% abstention (factual, suggests structural shift)
   - Historical trend +1pp/cycle from 27% (1989) to 39% (2014) (factual, official)
   - New PLM system may increase urban engagement (moderate evidence, expert opinion)

5. **Blind spot**: Unexpected macro shock (terrorist attack, major scandal, extreme weather) in final week could push abstention to 48-52%, making my 90th percentile (49%) look too confident. Would push outcome UP.

6. **Status quo**: 2014 level (36.45%) represents last "normal" election. Given 6-year trend and structural factors, expecting exact reversion seems unlikely. Modest upward shift to 40-42% respects both historical momentum and partial COVID normalization.

7. **Technicalities**: Values strictly increasing, in % units, within bounds [25, 55]. ✓
