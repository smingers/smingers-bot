Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Web Articles:**

1. **Le Monde (30 Jan 2026)** - Recent article on Paris mayoral race. Factual data on LFI's electoral performance (2022 presidential: 30% in Paris; 2024 parliamentary: 4/18 constituencies). High quality source, but focused on Paris-specific politics rather than national abstention.

2. **Fondapol (2014)** - Historical data compilation showing average first-round abstention 1959-2014 was 26.5%. High quality for historical context but dated; pre-COVID baseline.

3. **The Conversation (6 July 2020)** - Academic analysis by Pierre Bréchon. Key facts: 2020 first round had 55.3% abstention (+18.8 points vs 2014). Critical finding: only 39% of abstentionists cited COVID as primary reason, suggesting structural factors. High quality, expert opinion from named political scientist.

4. **CEVIPOF (June 2020)** - Describes research methodology during COVID but contains no abstention data. Limited relevance.

5. **Le Monde Décodeurs (15 March 2020)** - Factual reporting: 55.36% abstention in 2020 first round vs 36.45% in 2014. Expert quotes from Frédéric Dabi (IFOP) and Martial Foucault (Sciences Po) on unprecedented nature. High quality, contemporaneous reporting.

6. **Pokaa (15 Sept 2025)** - Local Strasbourg poll (614 voters). Commissioned by candidate's own movement, small sample, 6 months before election. Low reliability for national trends.

7. **Le HuffPost (13 Jan 2026)** - Compilation of local polls but contains no abstention rate information. Limited relevance.

8. **Le Parisien (4 Feb 2026)** - Local reporting on Évry-Courcouronnes concerns about repeating 72.89% abstention. Contains anecdotal evidence and candidate opinions but no national data. Mixed opinions from Farida Amrani (optimistic) vs Stéphane Beaudet (concerned). Recent but local focus.

**Agent Report:**

Comprehensive compilation of Interior Ministry data showing first-round abstention rates:
- 1977: 21.6%
- 1983: 21.7%
- 1989: 30.9%
- 1995: 30.6%
- 2001: 33.7%
- 2008: 33.5%
- 2014: 38.7%
- 2020: 55.3%

Expert scenarios for 2026:
- "Return-to-normal": 40-43%
- CEVIPOF "persistent malaise": 46-49%
- "COVID scar" minority view: ~50%

Critical note: No national polls published yet as of mid-February 2026. High quality synthesis but acknowledges information gaps.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **All French municipal elections 1977-2020 (excluding 2020)**: Average ~32%, but shows clear upward trend from 21.6% (1977) to 38.7% (2014). Most suitable for long-term structural trends.

2. **Recent pre-COVID municipal elections (2001-2014)**: Range 33.5-38.7%, average ~35.3%. Captures modern political disaffection but misses potential post-2020 shifts.

3. **2020 election adjusted for COVID effect**: If 39% of 55.3% abstention was COVID-driven, structural abstention was ~44%. Highly speculative calculation.

4. **Post-dissolution political climate (2024-2026)**: No direct comparables exist. The 2024 parliamentary dissolution created unprecedented political fragmentation.

**Most suitable reference class**: Recent pre-COVID elections (2001-2014) with adjustments for structural deterioration. The 2020 election is too anomalous to use directly, but the finding that 61% of abstentionists cited non-COVID reasons suggests structural factors have worsened beyond the 2014 baseline.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction timeframe**: 30 days from today (13 Feb 2026) to first round (15 March 2026).

**Historical patterns over similar periods:**
- Municipal elections show relatively stable abstention patterns compared to other election types
- The 2014→2020 jump of +16.8 points was unprecedented and COVID-driven
- Pre-COVID trend showed gradual increase: +5.2 points from 2001 to 2014 (13 years) = ~0.4 points/year
- If trend continued from 2014 baseline: 38.7% + (6 years × 0.4) = ~41% expected for 2026 absent COVID

**Key factors for 2026:**
1. **Time elapsed since COVID**: 6 years should allow return toward normal
2. **Political climate**: Post-2024 dissolution described as "terrible" in question background
3. **Procedural changes**: New uniform proportional list system may slightly depress turnout in small communes (CEVIPOF estimate: -1 point)
4. **Structural disaffection**: Bréchon's finding that 61% of 2020 abstentionists cited non-COVID reasons suggests deeper malaise

**(d) Justification:**

The outside view prediction must balance several factors:

**Downward pressure (toward lower abstention):**
- Removal of COVID fear factor
- Return to normal campaign conditions
- Traditional municipal elections have strong local engagement

**Upward pressure (toward higher abstention):**
- Structural trend: abstention increased from 21.6% (1977) to 38.7% (2014)
- Post-2024 political crisis and dissolution creating disaffection
- Bréchon's evidence that structural factors (not just COVID) drove much of 2020's abstention
- Expert consensus ranges from 40-50%, all above 2014 baseline
- Procedural reforms may create minor confusion/discouragement

**Central estimate reasoning:**
The expert scenarios provide useful anchors:
- "Return-to-normal": 40-43% (optimistic)
- "Persistent malaise": 46-49% (pessimistic)
- Minority "COVID scar": ~50%

Given that:
1. COVID is gone but structural factors remain
2. Political climate is described as "terrible"
3. No national polls yet contradict expert ranges
4. 2014 baseline was 38.7%, and structural trend suggests ~41% absent any crisis

A reasonable central estimate would be **43-46%**, splitting between optimistic return-to-normal and persistent malaise scenarios.

Outside view calibration:

**(a) Distribution considerations:**

I need to predict a true probability distribution that captures genuine uncertainty. The expert ranges (40-50%) provide a reasonable starting framework, but I must account for:
- Possibility of better-than-expected return to pre-COVID levels
- Possibility of worse-than-expected persistent disaffection
- Unknown unknowns in a volatile political environment

**(b) Previously established distributions:**

The historical data shows:
- Pre-2020 range: 21.6% to 38.7% (17.1 point spread over 43 years)
- Recent stable period (2001-2014): 33.5% to 38.7% (5.2 point spread)
- 2020 anomaly: 55.3%

Expert projections cluster 40-50%, suggesting this is the most likely range.

**(c) Tail value considerations:**

**Lower tail (10th percentile):** Could abstention return close to 2014 levels? Possible if:
- Political engagement surprisingly high
- Local issues dominate over national malaise
- New procedures don't confuse voters
Reasonable floor: ~38% (approaching 2014 level)

**Upper tail (90th percentile):** Could abstention remain very high? Possible if:
- Political crisis deepens
- "COVID scar" persists behaviorally
- Procedural confusion significant
Reasonable ceiling: ~52% (well below 2020 but showing persistent elevation)

**(d) Rate of upsets:**

Municipal elections have been relatively predictable except for 2020's COVID shock. However:
- The 2024 dissolution was itself an upset
- Political volatility is high
- No modern precedent for current situation

This suggests moderately wide intervals are appropriate, but not as wide as for completely unprecedented events.

**Calibration:**
- 10th percentile: Optimistic scenario where return-to-normal largely succeeds: 39%
- 20th percentile: Mild return-to-normal: 41%
- 40th percentile: Lower end of expert consensus: 43%
- 60th percentile: Upper end of return-to-normal, lower persistent malaise: 45%
- 80th percentile: Mid-range persistent malaise: 48%
- 90th percentile: High persistent malaise with some behavioral scarring: 51%

This distribution:
- Centers on 43-45% (between expert scenarios)
- Allows for better outcomes (down to 39%)
- Allows for worse outcomes (up to 51%)
- Maintains strictly increasing values
- Reflects genuine uncertainty without being artificially smooth
