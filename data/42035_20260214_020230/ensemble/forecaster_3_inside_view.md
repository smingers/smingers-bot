Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; date)
- ICI / France Bleu (Feb 9, 2026) – interview with Frédéric Dabi (IFOP): expert commentary that turnout could go either way (weariness/disgust vs attachment to local officials); notes unprecedented Paris rules and possible “differential mobilization.” High-quality identifiable expert; Paris-focused; no national turnout estimate.
- DNA.fr & L’Alsace.fr (Jan 24, 2026) – paywalled local press, cites Sciences Po/CEVIPOF researcher Éric Kerrouche on the paradox of collapsing participation despite proximity/popu­larity of mayors; provides historical abstention numbers (1989, 2020). Medium quality (quote likely accurate), but incomplete article limits usefulness; no quantified 2026 forecast.
- Actu.fr (Feb 12, 2026) – “three challenges: parity, abstention, disinformation,” mentions Russian-linked interference efforts and government countermeasures; reiterates 2020 as COVID-skewed and uses 2014 as benchmark; states 58% confidence in municipal councils. Medium quality generalist synthesis; relevant mechanism (trust/disinfo), but not quantified.
- France Bleu Marseille (Feb 5, 2026) – local reporting: very high abstention pockets in Marseille in 2020; anecdotal street interviews show persistent disillusionment in northern districts. Good local texture, but anecdotal; not nationally representative.
- CentrePresseAveyron / LaDépeche (Feb 3, 2026) – retrospective on 2020 + cites a 2025 “Destin commun” study that ~60% say they are already determined to vote in 2026. Medium quality; the “determined to vote” statistic is relevant but is intention/attitude, not a validated national turnout forecast.
- LaProvence.com (Feb 2, 2026) – IFOP (François Kraus) observation that big-city turnout is structurally lower than small communes, with 2014 examples. Medium-high quality (named IFOP source); mechanism is credible and persistent.
- Ouest-France (Feb 13, 2026) – one department (Maine-et-Loire): many outgoing mayors not running again. High-quality local reporting; relevance is ambiguous (more competition may mobilize, or loss of trusted incumbent may demobilize).
- LaDépeche (Feb 13, 2026) – procedural explanation of list system / thresholds / fusions in Tarn. High quality for rules; implies more uniform party-list logic in small communes (potentially less “personal” politics).
- CNEWS (Feb 12, 2026) – candidacy deadlines explainer; mostly procedural. Adequate for dates; low analytical value.
- 20minutes (Feb 12, 2026) – ski resort discount for voters; anecdotal anti-abstention effort. Low evidentiary value nationally.
- Franceinfo “results template” commune pages (Nov 2025) – historical local turnout snippets; accurate but purely historical and local.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence (large shifts)
1) Outside-view structural trend (pre-2020 rising abstention culminating ~38.7% in 2014) + strong persistence of “big cities abstain more” (IFOP/Kraus). These are stable, structural regularities.
2) Removal of the acute COVID shock from 2020 (a one-off factor). This strongly pushes abstention down versus 55.3%.

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
3) Procedural reform: proportional list system now uniform across communes + Paris/Lyon/Marseille governance-rule changes. Likely to (i) reduce the “personalized/panachage” feel in small communes (downward turnout pressure), while (ii) increasing perceived stakes/competitiveness in some big cities (upward turnout pressure). Net effect uncertain; I weight slightly toward higher abstention nationally because small communes are numerous and previously had comparatively higher participation.
4) Post-2024 political malaise + fragmentation (as referenced by Dabi and in multiple articles). Plausible upward pressure on abstention, but hard to quantify.
5) Disinformation/interference risk (actu.fr) as a trust-dampener: plausible modest upward pressure; countermeasures exist, so not extreme.

Weak evidence (small shifts)
6) Anecdotal neighborhood disillusionment in Marseille; “reward to vote” initiatives; local mayor non-candidacies. These can matter locally but are noisy at the national level.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time until first round: ~30 days (from Feb 13 to Mar 15, 2026). Resolution is ~33 days away (by Mar 18).
- If the timeframe were halved (two weeks to go): I’d expect more concrete inputs (final lists, first national turnout/interest polling, intensity of campaigns), likely narrowing uncertainty (tighter 10–90) and possibly shifting mean modestly based on measured salience.
- If the timeframe were doubled (~60 days): I’d widen uncertainty (more time for shocks: scandals, security events, major institutional crisis) and place slightly more weight on outside-view baselines.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustments from the outside view)
Outside view base-rate distribution given: (10/20/40/60/80/90) = 39 / 41 / 43 / 45 / 48 / 51.

Key inside-view considerations relative to that base rate:
- Downward vs outside view (lower abstention): 2020’s COVID-specific fear factor is absent; several sources imply municipal offices still enjoy comparatively higher trust (actu.fr cites 58% confidence in municipal councils), and Dabi explicitly notes continued “affection” for local officials.
- Upward vs outside view (higher abstention): (i) procedural uniform list voting in all communes may reduce the “local/personal” voting link in small communes that traditionally anchor turnout; (ii) continuing national political fatigue/distrust post-dissolution; (iii) disinformation environment is more salient than in 2014/2020 and could marginally depress participation.

Net: I make only a small adjustment versus the outside view—keeping the center near ~44–45% but widening the upper tail a bit (52%) because the risk scenario (persistent malaise + procedural alienation + low-salience campaign) is plausible and would not require a COVID-like shock.

Distribution calibration
- (a) If the “current trend continued” (pre-2020 upward drift + some post-2024 disgust): abstention plausibly lands mid-40s.
- (b) I’m aiming for a true distribution: center in mid-40s; meaningful tails for (i) a genuine reversion near 2014 (high-30s) and (ii) a stubbornly high outcome above 50 without a pandemic.
- (c) Tail choice: I set 10th at 38 (a bit below outside-view 39) to allow a stronger-than-expected “municipal reversion,” and 90th at 52 (a bit above outside-view 51) to reflect compounded-demobilization risk.
- (d) Sensitivity: shifting all percentiles +10 points (to ~48–62) would implicitly assume something like a new major shock or extreme institutional crisis—unsupported today. Shifting -10 (to ~28–42) would assume a broad enthusiasm wave returning to early-2000s levels—also not supported.

Checklist:
1) Target variable: National abstention rate (%) of registered voters in the 1st round of French municipal elections on Mar 15, 2026 (Interior Ministry figure).
2) Outside view base rate distribution: P10 39, P20 41, P40 43, P60 45, P80 48, P90 51.
3) Consistency check: Implied median ≈ 44.3; mean ≈ 44.7; consistent with “mid-40s” central expectation.
4) Most significant evidence (≤20 words each):
   - 2014 abstention ~38.7% and long-run upward trend is structurally persistent.
   - 2020’s 55% abstention was COVID-skewed; that shock is absent in 2026.
   - Uniform list voting may reduce small-commune personalization; big-city abstention structurally high (IFOP).
   - Post-2024 political fatigue and disinformation could modestly depress participation.
5) Blind spot: A sudden nationwide “municipalization” of politics (high-salience local issues) could drop abstention into high-30s.
6) Status quo outcome: “mid-40s abstention” is the slow-changing continuation from 2014 adjusted for post-2020 context.
7) Technicalities: Percentiles strictly increasing; units in % abstaining; within/open bounds (25–55) with tails not extreme.
