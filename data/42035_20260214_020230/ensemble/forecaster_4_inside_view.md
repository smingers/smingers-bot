Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological order, most relevant to abstention)

1. Fondapol “Les chiffres de l’abstention depuis 1959” (undated compilation, last data-point 2020). Factual, Interior-Ministry numbers.  High quality.  Gives the long series 1977–2020.

2. CNEWS 1 Feb 2026 “Quels étaient les taux de participation en 2020 ?”  Repeats the official 2020 figures (participation 44.66 %, i.e. abstention 55.34 %).  Reliable, but purely historical.

3. DNA / L’Alsace 24 Jan 2026 “Pourquoi le taux d’abstention ne cesse de grimper”.  Lists the historic national abstention for 1989 (27.2 %) → 2020 (55.3 %).  Expert quoted (Sciences-Po’s Éric Kerrouche) says structural disaffection continues.  Moderate quality (regional daily, cites Interior-Ministry data).

4. IFOP interview 9 Feb 2026.  Pollster Frédéric Dabi notes “double scenario” but no hard number.  Opinion from identifiable expert.  Suggests turnout could rise where mayors are liked.  Weak-to-moderate evidence.

5. Actu.fr 12 Feb 2026 “Abstention, parité, désinformation : enjeux majeurs”.  States that a 2025 Destin commun survey found 60 % of people “resolved to vote” in 2026.  Single poll, methodology not detailed.  Moderate evidence downward on abstention.

6. France Bleu 5 Feb 2026 on Marseille.  Quotes 2020 local abstention 67 %, interviews voters expressing disillusion.  Anecdotal, weak evidence for continued high abstention in large cities.

7. Legislation changes (Décret 2025-848; parity law; uniform list system).  Official texts, strong factual evidence that electoral supply may be harder in small communes.

8. Miscellaneous local articles (Ouest-France, La Dépêche, ski-resort incentive, etc.).  Anecdotal, negligible national impact.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong:
• Long-run upward trend 1977→2014 (+17 pts in 7 cycles).  
• Structural disaffection since 2014 documented by multiple academic sources.

Moderate:
• 2025 survey showing 60 % self-declared intention to vote (would imply abstention ≈ 40 %).  
• Parity + uniform-list rules may depress candidate supply in <1 000-inh. communes → higher abstention.  
• Post-2024 political malaise widely reported.

Weak:
• Ski-pass incentive, isolated mayoral races, weather speculation, anecdotal quotes.

Net: moderate upward pressure (disaffection + institutional change) balanced by moderate downward pressure (no Covid, stated intention to vote).  Strong evidence anchors in mid-40s.

(c) Timeframe
Days to first round: 30.  If the horizon were halved (15 d), only late-breaking scandals/weather could still move turnout → I’d widen the 80–90th tail by +1 pt.  If doubled (60 d), more campaign dynamics could matter; I’d widen both tails by +2 pts.

(d) Justification & adjustments
Outside-view centre (trend-extrapolated 1977–2014): 44 %.  
Upward adjustments (+2 pts total):
  • Continued structural rise since 2014 (+1 pt).  
  • New parity/list rules reduce competitiveness in small communes (+1 pt).  
Downward adjustments (-1 pt total):
  • No pandemic, some re-mobilisation signs (survey, popularity of mayors).  
Net inside-view median ≈ 45 %.  Uncertainty retained: a 1-in-10 chance Covid-level shock or major abstention wave (maintain 56 % at P90); a 1-in-10 chance of unexpected mobilisation (37 % at P10).

Distribution calibration
I model a mildly right-skewed distribution (beta-like) centred 45 %, σ ≈ 5 pts.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: national abstention rate (%) in first round, 15 Mar 2026, Interior-Ministry figure.
2. Base-rate distribution: 10 37.5 / 20 39.5 / 40 42.5 / 60 45.5 / 80 49.5 / 90 56.0
3. Consistency: median≈45 %, mean≈45 %; aligns with “slightly above 2014, far below 2020”.
4. Key evidence: (i) historic upward trend, (ii) parity/list rule change, (iii) 2025 survey 60 % intend to vote, (iv) no-Covid context, (v) continued political distrust post-2024.
5. Blind-spot: major terror attack or violent unrest just before 15 Mar lowering turnout nationwide → pushes abstention well above 50 %.
6. Status-quo (trend) outcome ≈ 44 %; my median 45 % only modestly above.
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units %, within open bounds.
