Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Fondapol data sheet “Les chiffres de l’abstention depuis 1959” (2014). Factual: official Interior-ministry abstention figures 1959-2014. High quality; numbers are primary-source reproductions. Opinion section can be ignored.  
2. Le Monde “Municipales : 55,36 % d’abstention …” (15 Mar 2020). Factual: final 2020 first-round abstention 55.3 %. Contains expert interviews (IFOP, Sciences-Po) explaining Covid effect; keep the figure, treat comments as informed opinion.  
3. The Conversation – Bréchon (6 Jul 2020). Factual: repeats 55.3 % / 58.4 %; cites Ipsos/IFOP surveys on motives (≈ 39 % Covid). Good methodological transparency; expert author.  
4. CEVIPOF Covid-attitudes project note (2020). Describes survey panel; no turnout data. Low direct relevance; ignore for quantification.  
5. Local / campaign articles (Le Monde 30 Jan 2026; Pokaa Sep 2025; HuffPost Feb 2026; Le Parisien 4 Feb 2026). Only offer anecdotal or city-level material; not used for national baseline.  
6. Agent report (collates Interior-ministry series 1977-2020 and reviews expert expectations 2026). The historical figures echo Fondapol/Interior-ministry bulletins, so regarded as accurate. The quoted forward-looking ranges (40-50 %) are informed but still opinion – note but do not anchor on them.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
i) All French municipal first-round abstention rates 1959-2020 (10 elections).   
ii) Same, but post-1977 decentralisation (1977-2014, 7 elections).  
iii) Post-1990 modern era excluding the Covid shock (1995-2014, 4 elections).  
iv) All nationwide local elections since 1995 (departmental, regional, municipal) to enlarge sample.

Class iii is chosen: a) it matches contemporary sociological conditions (party fragmentation, EU membership, stable electoral law pre-2020); b) it excludes the Covid outlier yet captures the secular upward drift. Class iii data: 1995 30.6 %, 2001 33.7 %, 2008 33.5 %, 2014 38.7 %. Mean = 34.1 %; linear trend ≈ +1 pp every six years.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until outcome: 31.  In past cycles the bulk of turnout variation was driven by structural rather than short-term events; late campaign shocks (e.g., 2014 Sarkozy tapes, 2008 financial headlines) moved first-round participation by <1 pp. Therefore the outside view should treat the remaining month as noise relative to multi-year forces.

(d) Justification  
• Long-term drift: from 30-34 % (1995-2008) to 38.7 % (2014) implies a pre-Covid slope of +0.9 pp per cycle. Extrapolating to 2020 would have suggested ~40 %.  
• Covid added about +15 pp of “extra” abstention. Survey evidence (Ipsos/IFOP 2020) attributes roughly two-fifths of abstentionists directly to virus fears; therefore ≈ 6 pp (40 % × 15 pp) of the 2020 spike could persist for structural reasons, ≈ 9 pp should disappear with the health situation normalised.  
• Other elections since 2020 (2022 legislative 52 % abstention, 2024 snap parliamentary 55 %) indicate continuing disengagement above 2017 levels; translating to municipals, add perhaps +3 pp relative to the pre-Covid trend.  
Putting pieces together:  
Baseline extrapolation for 2026 = 40 % (trend) +3 % (general malaise) = 43 %.  
Uncertainty drivers: turnout in very small communes under the new list system (possible –1 pp); PLM double ballot uncertainty (±1 pp); macro-level shock risk (e.g., new scandal, security incident) historically ~±3 pp.  Combining yields a σ ≈ 4 pp.  

Outside view calibration:
I translate the normal-ish uncertainty (μ = 43 %, σ ≈ 4 pp) into percentiles, then widen the 10th/90th a bit to respect fat-tail surprises observed in 2020 and in 2002 presidential first round (unexpected record abstention).  I also cap the lower tail because the series has never gone below 30 % since 1989.

Percentiles (strictly increasing):  
• 10th ≈ 37 % (one and a half σ below μ, plus extra cushion)  
• 20th ≈ 40 %  
• 40th ≈ 42 %  
• 60th ≈ 44 %  
• 80th ≈ 47 %  
• 90th ≈ 52 % (two-plus σ above μ, fat-tail allowance but well short of the 2020 extreme)

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 37
Percentile 20: 40
Percentile 40: 42
Percentile 60: 44
Percentile 80: 47
Percentile 90: 52
