Analysis:
a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)
1. Actu.fr (12 Feb 2026) – overview piece naming abstention, parity, disinformation as “major challenges”. Facts: 2020 abstention 55 %; 2014 participation 60 %. Opinion: high 2026 abstention would show distrust. Recent, reputable regional outlet; numbers taken from Interior Ministry – reliable.
2. France Bleu Marseille (5 Feb 2026) – reportage on very high 2020 abstention in Marseille (67 % city-wide, up to 88  % in some districts) and current voter disillusion. Mainly anecdotal quotations; weak evidence but highlights urban demobilisation risk. Good local radio, but small sample.
3. Ouest-France (13 Feb 2026) – 63 of 183 Maine-et-Loire mayors not running again; suggests local detachment and list-building difficulties. Largest regional daily, factual.
4. IFOP interview (9 Feb 2026) – pollster Frédéric Dabi stresses “real uncertainty”, cites weariness vs affection for mayors; no hard turnout numbers. Identifiable expert, moderate weight.
5. DNA/L’Alsace (24 Jan 2026) – long-term series 1989-2020 shows monotonically rising abstention (27 %→55 %). Strong historical evidence, reputable dailies.
6. CNEWS (1 Feb 2026) – recalls 44.66 % participation (55.34 % abstention) in 2020 and >60 % participation pre-Covid. Numbers from Interior Ministry – accurate.
7. Boulevard Voltaire (25 Jan 2026) – opinion column calling 2020 results “illegitimate”. Low factual value, ideological bias – discounted.
8. Fondapol chart 1959-2014 (web archive) – official abstention series, high quality.
9. Destin commun survey (2025, quoted by several outlets) – 60 % of respondents said they “intend to vote” in 2026. Single source, self-report bias acknowledged.

b) Evidence weighting
Strong:
• Interior-Ministry historical series (1959-2014, 2020) – establishes long-run upward trend (+17 pp in 43 y)  
• Structural driver: rising political distrust documented by CEVIPOF/IFOP for a decade

Moderate:
• Mayoral list reforms (gender-parity lists for <1 000 inh.; uniform PR) – likely dampens mobilisation in small communes (Ouest-France)  
• Post-2024 political climate described as “weariness/disgust with politics” (IFOP, Actu.fr)

Weak:
• Anecdotal reports of ski-pass incentives or local civic campaigns  
• Urban campaign excitement in Paris/other big cities possibly boosting participation  

c) Timeframe analysis
Resolution in 31 days. Municipal turnout normally changes <1 pp during the final month unless a major exogenous shock (e.g., 2020 Covid). If the time window were halved to 15 days I would barely adjust; if doubled to 62 days I would widen the 10th–90th range by ~1 pp each side for additional shock risk.

d) Justification / inside-view adjustments
Base-rate (outside view) median 43–44 % abstention (derived from 1977-2014 linear trend, ignoring Covid spike).  
Upward adjustments (+):
• Persistent structural disaffection and post-dissolution malaise (+1.5 pp)  
• New list/parity rules likely reduce small-town personalisation (+0.5 pp)  
• Long-term trend already upward (+0.3 pp beyond linear fit)  
Downward adjustments (–):
• Absence of Covid exceptional deterrent (–1.0 pp)  
Net shift ≈ +1.3 pp → new central estimate ~45.5–46 %.  
Uncertainty: still sizeable tail risk of 50 %+ if late scandal/apathy wave, or 38 % if surprise mobilisation. Retain fat-tailed distribution.

Distribution calibration
10th: 35 %  – low-end scenario: strong local mobilisation, reform effects benign, urban turnout rebounds  
20th: 39 %  – similar to 2014, implies genuine remobilisation  
40th: 44 %  – base-rate absent new demobilisers  
60th: 47 %  – central inside-view median (~46 %) rounded upward  
80th: 51 %  – Covid-hangover/structural distrust persists strongly  
90th: 54 %  – near-repeat of 2020 outside pandemic (extreme apathy or major security scare)

Checklist:
1. Target variable: national abstention (% of registered voters) first round, 15 Mar 2026.  
2. Outside-view distribution stated; final forecast anchored and modestly shifted up.  
3. Implied median ≈46 %; mean ≈46 %; coherent with justification.  
4. Key evidence: upward historical trend; Covid-free environment; new list/parity rules; post-2024 political distrust; self-reported 60 % voter intention.  
5. Blind-spot: Late national crisis (terror, health) cutting turnout 10 pp – would push abstention above my 90th.  
6. Status-quo (Covid 2020) = 55 %. Forecast nudged toward but well below this extreme.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, same units, within open bounds.
