Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Le Monde (30 Jan 2026) – Paris-specific race; no national turnout data. Recent, high journalistic credibility, but content irrelevant for abstention.  
2. Fondapol data sheet (2014) – Gives Interior-Ministry abstention figures 1959-2014. Methodologically sound (official data), but somewhat dated. Purely factual.  
3. The Conversation (Bréchon, Jul 2020) – Academic article explaining 2020 spike; cites Ipsos/IFOP surveys. Good scholarly quality; contains both facts (55.3 % abstention, survey numbers) and interpretation (structure vs. Covid).  
4. CEVIPOF project note (Jun 2020) – Describes a multi-country Covid attitude panel; no direct turnout numbers. High academic quality; irrelevant for our variable.  
5. Le Monde “Les Décodeurs” (15 Mar 2020) – Same 55.3 % figure, historical comparisons, expert quotes. Reliable newspaper, factual numbers taken from Interior Ministry; expert opinions (Dabi, Foucault) are informed but dated to the Covid shock.  
6. Pokaa (15 Sep 2025) – Local Strasbourg poll; no turnout content.  
7. Le HuffPost map (Jan 2026) – Collates local polls; repeats procedural calendar. No turnout content.  
8. Le Parisien (4 Feb 2026) – Focus on one suburb’s high 2020 abstention and voter-registration issues; anecdotal evidence only.  
9. Agent report – Consolidates Interior-Ministry first-round abstention 1977-2020 (21.6 % → 55.3 %), lists expert ranges for 2026 (40-50 %), and describes reform effects. It explicitly names primary sources, so I treat the historical numbers as factual; the quoted expert ranges are opinions from identifiable academics or officials.

Conclusion: For an outside view only items 2, 3, 5 and the historical figures in 9 are directly useful; the rest add little signal.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
1. All French municipal first-round abstention rates 1959-2020.  
2. Post-1977 municipal first-round abstention (start of Fifth-Republic “modern” series) – 8 elections.  
3. First-round abstention in all French elections (presidential, legislative, regional, European).  

Option 2 is best: same election type, unchanged two-round structure, covers the period in which abstention moved from ~22 % to ~39 % before the pandemic. Option 1 adds very old values when the electorate and local-government system were different; option 3 mixes elections with very different salience.

Data in the chosen reference class (Interior Ministry, first round):  
1977 21.6, 1983 21.7, 1989 30.9, 1995 30.6, 2001 33.7, 2008 33.5, 2014 38.7, 2020 55.3 %.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Time until resolution: 31 days.  In the seven elections between 1977-2014, the abstention rate changed by |Δ|=1-9 pp between cycles six years apart, median ≈3 pp.  Campaign-period shocks inside the last month have historically been small (≤1 pp) except for 2020 when the Covid epidemic broke days before the vote.  Therefore an outside view can ignore intra-month volatility and focus on the slowly moving six-year trend.

(d) Justification  
Step 1 – Trend extrapolation without the Covid outlier.  1977-2014 shows a linear increase of ≈0.46 pp per year (17 pp over 37 years).  Extending this 12 years to 2026 yields an “expected” abstention ≈38.7 + (0.46 × 12) ≈ 44 %.  

Step 2 – Historical volatility.  The standard deviation of election-to-election changes 1977-2014 is 3.1 pp; two six-year intervals (2014→2026) introduce σ ≈ √2 × 3.1 ≈ 4.4 pp around the trend.  

Step 3 – Tail adjustments for unknown unknowns.  Possible structural disaffection or an unforeseen late shock could keep abstention close to the Covid-era 50+ % (upper tail) or conversely renewed mobilisation could pull it back toward mid-30s (lower tail).  To reflect that I widen the 10th/90th bounds roughly ±9 pp from the mean instead of ±5.6 pp implied by a pure normal fit.

Outside view calibration:
Anchor distribution: mean 44 %, treated as approximately normal but fattened tails.  
10th/90th chosen so that 80 % probability mass lies between 35 % and 51 %, matching the broad expert corridor (40-50 %) yet leaving room for surprises.  Intermediate percentiles are placed linearly in probability space and checked for monotonicity.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 35  
Percentile 20: 38  
Percentile 40: 42  
Percentile 60: 45  
Percentile 80: 48  
Percentile 90: 51
