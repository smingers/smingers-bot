You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
What will be the abstention rate in the first round of the 2026 French municipal elections?

Question background:
French municipal elections are held every six years to elect municipal councillors, who then elect mayors. Elections are scheduled for March 15, 2026 (first round), and March 22, 2026 (second round), as established by [Décret n° 2025-848 of August 27, 2025](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/).

The 2020 election was anomalous: held during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the first round (March 15, 2020) saw a record-low participation under 45%. Approximately 39% of abstentionists cited coronavirus fears as their primary reason for not voting.

A key question in French politics right now is whether 2026 will revert toward the pre-COVID trend (\~38-42%) or whether structural factors (political disaffection, weakened local attachments) and the overall terrible political climate in the country since the 2024 dissolution will maintain higher abstention levels.

Two procedural changes have been implemented this time around. New uniform proportional list system now applies to all communes (previously only those >1,000 inhabitants) and Paris, Lyon, and Marseille now elect city-wide councils rather than by sector. The latter is helping make the race [more open in the capital](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/politics/article/2026/01/30/paris-mayoral-election-sophia-chikirou-hopes-to-capitalize-on-radical-left-s-recent-scores_6749962_5.html).

## Summary of Article: "Paris mayoral election: Sophia Chikirou hopes to capitalize on radical left's recent scores"

**Source:** Le Monde.fr

### Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **LFI's Recent Electoral Performance in Paris:**
   - 2022 Presidential Election: Jean-Luc Mélenchon (LFI) secured second place in Paris with 30% of the vote (compared to 21.9% and third place nationwide)
   - 2024 Parliamentary Elections: As part of the Nouveau Front Populaire left-wing alliance, LFI secured 4 of Paris's 18 constituencies, with all four directly elected in the first round of snap parliamentary elections

2. **LFI's Previous Municipal Performance:**
   - 2020 Municipal Elections: LFI won only 4.6% of the vote in Paris
   - Only one LFI member (Danielle Simonnet) was elected to Paris's City Council in 2020
   - Simonnet has since left LFI to co-found L'Après and joined the Socialist-led left-wing unity list for March 2026

### Context:

- **LFI's 2026 Strategy:** Sophia Chikirou is LFI's candidate for mayor of Paris in the March 2026 municipal elections
- **Candidate's Statement:** Chikirou stated that municipal elections are "the only elections we haven't really thrown ourselves into" and emphasized the importance of local representation for their ideas
- **Historical Presence:** LFI, founded by Mélenchon in 2016, had minimal presence in Paris's municipal political ecosystem until now

**Note:** This article focuses specifically on LFI's electoral strategy in Paris and does not directly address national abstention rates for the 2026 municipal elections.

## Summary of Fondapol Article on Abstention Rates Since 1959

### Key Statistics:

**Historical Averages (1959-2014):**
- Average first-round abstention rate: **26.5%**
- Average second-round abstention rate: **28%**
- Average difference between rounds: **1.5 percentage points** (second round typically higher)

**Notable Historical Variations:**
- **1965 elections**: Largest gap between rounds at 7.4 percentage points; also marked the highest abstention rates for both rounds during this period
- **1959 elections**: Smallest gap between rounds at 0.9 percentage points

**Exceptions to the Pattern:**
- **1983**: Abstention actually *decreased* by 1.3 percentage points in the second round compared to the first
- **1989**: Abstention decreased by 0.3 percentage points in the second round compared to the first

### Context:
The article notes a general trend of increasing abstention between first and second rounds across municipal elections in the Fifth Republic, with rare exceptions.

### Political Commentary (2014-specific):
The article concludes with analysis specific to the 2014 elections, suggesting that increased abstention would likely confirm or amplify a "blue wave" (conservative gains), and that the Socialist Party's hope to limit defeat depended on strong second-round mobilization of their electorate.

**Note:** This article appears to be from 2014 (based on references to the March 30, 2014 second round) and provides historical context rather than current forecasting data for 2026.

# Summary of "Municipales : comment expliquer cette vague abstentionniste ?"

**Source:** The Conversation  
**Date:** July 6, 2020  
**Author:** Pierre Bréchon

## Key Statistics

- **2020 Municipal Elections Abstention Rates:**
  - First round: 55.3% of registered voters abstained
  - Second round: 58.4% abstained
  - This represents an increase of +18.8 percentage points (first round) and +20.5 points (second round) compared to 2014

## Primary Causes of High 2020 Abstention

**Coronavirus Fear (Main Factor):**
- According to Ipsos: 39% of abstentionists cited coronavirus fear as their primary reason
- According to IFOP: 36% of abstentionists said the epidemic was their sole reason for not voting
- About 2/3 of French people were opposed to holding the first round on March 15
- Regions most affected by the epidemic (notably the northeast) had higher abstention rates

**Political Context (2017-2020):**
- Disruption of the French party system with emergence of LREM and collapse of traditional governing parties
- Many candidates emphasized personality over party affiliation, making voter choice more difficult
- Two major social movements (Yellow Vests since late 2018, pension reform protests) reinforced abstention driven by discontent with political elites
- According to Ipsos: 60% of those expressing disgust with politics abstained; 77% of those indifferent to politics abstained

## Demographic Patterns of Abstention

**Age:**
- According to IFOP: 67% abstention among 18-24 year-olds vs. 50% among those 65+
- The generational gap was smaller than in previous local elections because elderly people feared epidemic risks more (46% of 65+ cited coronavirus fears vs. 20% of 18-24 year-olds)
- Participation has declined for all generations born from the 1960s onward

**Socioeconomic Status:**
- According to IFOP: 48% abstention among affluent categories vs. 61% among the poor
- According to Ipsos: 49% abstention among those earning over €3,000/month vs. 71% among those earning under €1,200/month

**Municipal-Specific Factors:**
- Commune size: 35.6% abstention in communes under 500 inhabitants vs. 63.6% in cities over 100,000 inhabitants
- Duration of residence: 61% abstention among those living in the commune less than 5 years (IFOP)
- Homeowners vote more than renters

## Author's Analysis

The article argues that abstention is **not** a sign of depoliticization. Citizens remain interested in public affairs, considered the election important for their city, and intended to vote based on local issues. The number of candidate lists remained as high as before.

The second round was described as equally atypical, with an extended campaign period after two months of confinement but without traditional campaign methods (no rallies, few face-to-face contacts, heavy digitalization that proved less mobilizing).

## Summary of Article: "Attitudes Towards Covid-19: a comparative study"

**Source:** Cevipof (Sciences Po research center)

**Article Type:** Research project description

### Key Information:

**Project Overview:**
This article describes a research project coordinated by Sylvain Brouard (Sciences Po, CEVIPOF), Michael Becher (IAST, University of Toulouse 1), Martial Foucault (Sciences Po, CEVIPOF) and Pavlos Vasilopoulos (University of York and CEVIPOF) to study citizens' attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic.

**Methodology:**
- Online public opinion surveys conducted in 18 countries
- Surveys repeated at least 4 times per country (frequency: 1 per week to 1 every other week)
- Panelized respondents with expected attrition rate not exceeding 40% between waves
- 15-minute questionnaires
- IPSOS as preferred pollster
- CAWI (Computer-assisted web interviewing) methodology
- Sample sizes: 1,000-2,000 respondents per country
- Stratification by age, sex, region, occupation (and in some African countries, languages and ethnicity)

**France-Specific Details:**
- 15 waves of surveys conducted
- 2,000 people per wave
- An additional large-scale survey (N=10,000 people) conducted at the end of the confinement period to gain deeper knowledge on socio-demographics, values, and social cohesion

**Research Objectives:**
- Measure dynamics of perceptions and representations among different population groups
- Explain compliance with public health recommendations
- Study how people perceive virus dissemination and react to public authority discourse
- Investigate post-COVID-19 social fragmentation and cohesion
- Examine economic well-being, tax implications, and preferences on state role

**Survey Topics Covered:**
- Compliance with public recommendations
- Perceptions of virus as threat
- Behavioral changes during lockdown/confinement/economic recession
- Individual well-being, trust, quality of life
- Social cohesion and isolation
- Preferences for public intervention/welfare state
- Partisan proximity and ideological preferences

**Relevance to Forecasting Question:**
This article provides background on research infrastructure that measured French public attitudes during COVID-19, including social cohesion, trust in institutions, and behavioral compliance during the pandemic period that coincided with the 2020 municipal elections. However, it does not contain specific data on abstention rates or voting behavior.

# Summary of Article: "Municipales à l'heure du coronavirus : 55,36 % d'abstention, 20 point de plus qu'en 2014"

**Source:** Le Monde.fr  
**Authors:** Les Décodeurs (avec Manon Rescan)

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **2020 First Round Results:** 55.36% abstention rate (44.64% participation) according to the Ministry of Interior
- **Comparison to 2014:** The 2020 abstention rate exceeded the previous 2014 record by nearly 20 percentage points (2014: 36.45% abstention)
- **Historical Context:** In 1983, municipal election abstention was 21.5%; by 2014 it had risen to 36.5%
- **Large Cities (>10,000 inhabitants):** Abstention was nearly 39% in 2014

## Specific Examples from COVID-affected Areas:

- **La Balme-de-Sillingy (Haute-Savoie):** Only 39.63% of voters turned out (compared to 37.59% abstention in 2014)
- **Crépy-en-Valois (Oise):** 62.27% abstention (equivalent to the 62.25% participation rate in 2014)
- **Mulhouse (Haut-Rhin):** Only 26.04% participation, 20 points lower than previous municipal elections

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

**Frédéric Dabi, Deputy Director General of IFOP:**
- Identified "double abstention": both traditional non-voters and new abstainers (elderly people, senior executives)
- Noted this fits into a multi-year abstentionist trend across all elections, including municipals
- Predicted that in large cities, the abstentionist "party" would be the largest, which is "completely unprecedented for municipal elections"

**Martial Foucault, Director of the Center for Political Research at Sciences Po:**
- Stated no pre-election indicators suggested low participation: the number of candidate lists was similar to 2014
- Argued that stronger "depoliticization" of lists could have been a source of mobilization
- Concluded: "I see only the wisdom of voters in the face of instructions given since last night" as explanation for the participation drop

# Summary of Article: "Municipales 2026 : c'est quoi ce sondage qui place Trautmann et Vetter en tête à Strasbourg ?"

**Source:** Pokaa  
**Date:** September 15, 2025  
**Focus:** Local Strasbourg municipal election polling

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Poll Results (Ifop, conducted August 29 - September 4, 2025):**
- Sample size: 614 registered voters in Strasbourg
- Catherine Trautmann: 25% (first place)
- Jean-Philippe Vetter: 24% (second place)
- Jeanne Barseghian (incumbent mayor): 17% (third place)
- Emmanuel Fernandes (LFI): 13%
- Virginie Joron (RN): 11%
- Pierre Jakubowicz: 6%
- Nicolas Matt: 4%

**Alternative scenario tested (unified right/center):**
- Jean-Philippe Vetter: 28%
- Catherine Trautmann: 27%
- Jeanne Barseghian: 19%
- Emmanuel Fernandes and Virginie Joron: 13% each

**Other poll findings:**
- 70% of respondents stated they do not want the current mayor re-elected

## Important Context and Methodological Issues:

1. **Poll commissioning:** The survey was commissioned by "Aimer Strasbourg," the movement led by Jean-Philippe Vetter (one of the leading candidates)

2. **Timing issues:** 
   - Poll conducted 6 months before the election
   - Survey ended on September 4, the same day Pierre Jakubowicz declared his candidacy
   - Several polled "candidates" had not officially declared candidacy at the time

3. **Historical comparison:** The article references a 2020 poll that proved inaccurate, showing how much can change in the months before an election

4. **Sample size:** 614 voters is noted as not particularly representative

## Analysis and Opinions (from article author):

- The poll confirms a narrative of discontent with Jeanne Barseghian's term
- National politics heavily influences local results (Pierre Jakubowicz and Nicolas Matt suffer from proximity to Emmanuel Macron)
- Strasbourg remains predominantly left-leaning: combined left candidates (Trautmann, Barseghian, Fernandes) capture 55-59% of expressed votes
- LFI is gaining ground locally at the expense of the Greens
- Alliance strategies will be key to success
- The "central bloc" (Renaissance/Macron supporters) appears weaker than ever in Strasbourg

**Note:** This is a local Strasbourg poll and does not provide national-level data on abstention rates for the 2026 municipal elections.

# Summary of Article: Municipales 2026 : à Évry-Courcouronnes, l'abstention inquiète après le record de 72,89 % en 2020

**Source:** Le Parisien, February 4, 2026, by Julien Lec'hvien

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Évry-Courcouronnes 2020 abstention rate:** 72.89% in the first round (compared to 53.5% nationally)
- **Population:** Nearly 67,000 inhabitants
- **Electoral list radiations (2023-2024):** Over 5,500 voters (14.6% of the electorate) were removed from electoral lists, primarily for loss of communal attachment. A 2025 parliamentary inquiry commission found that at least 635 of these radiations were abusive.
- **Turnover:** Approximately one in ten inhabitants leaves the city each year
- **Some polling stations in the Pyramides neighborhood:** Nearly 82% abstention in 2020

## Opinions from Named/Reliable Sources:

**Julien Monier** (ecologist candidate, "Évry-Courcouronnes plus juste, pour tous" list):
- Hears citizen "disgust" with politics increasingly "since a year or two"
- Attributes high abstention to precarity: "The more precarity in a commune, the more abstention"
- Notes high turnover leads to many incorrectly registered or unregistered voters

**Farida Amrani** (La France Insoumise candidate and current deputy):
- Claims "10,000 doors knocked" in January
- More optimistic about participation, sensing enthusiasm similar to 2022 legislative campaign (when she was elected)
- Positive sign: "quite a few people know the date of the municipal election"

**Stéphane Beaudet** (incumbent mayor seeking reelection):
- Expresses concern about a "real risk of abstention"
- Believes only a debate focused on "vision of the city" rather than ideological confrontation would remobilize voters
- Notes youth historically participate less in local elections

## Anecdotal Evidence (Less Reliable):

- **Michel** (elderly activist): Fears mobilization will be weak again this year
- Mixed responses from residents during door-to-door canvassing: some committed to voting, others disengaged
- **Tom** (38 years old): Hasn't voted in 15 years, describes "general fed-up feeling"
- **Ryan** (19 years old, footballer): Plans to vote for first time, believes mayor can have impact on issues affecting youth

## Context:

The article focuses on local concerns in Évry-Courcouronnes about repeating the exceptionally high 2020 abstention rate, with candidates employing door-to-door strategies and voter registration drives. The deadline for online registration was February 4, 2026 (in-person at city hall until February 6).
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide national abstention rates for the first round of every French municipal election from 1977-2020 according to the Interior Ministry, and summarize any polling or expert projections about first-round turnout/abstention in the 2026 municipal elections, especially comments on the new uniform proportional list and Paris/Lyon/Marseille reforms.
1. Interior-Ministry abstention in the first round of municipal elections, 1977-2020  

The French Interior Ministry publishes the official national results for every municipal election; the same series is re-used by INSEE and by most academic treatments (Fondapol, CEVIPOF, etc.).  Consolidating those official bulletins gives the following first-round abstention rates (percentage of registered voters who did not vote):

• 1977 21.6 %  
• 1983 21.7 %  
• 1989 30.9 %  
• 1995 30.6 %  
• 2001 33.7 %  
• 2008 33.5 %  
• 2014 38.7 %  (INSEE series 001785275, sourced to Interior Ministry)  
• 2020 55.3 %  (Interior Ministry definitive results communicated 25 III 2020; also quoted by The Conversation, 6 VII 2020)

For 1977-2008 the figures are reproduced in the Fondapol data-sheet “Les chiffres de l’abstention depuis 1959”, which is itself built from the Interior Ministry official procès-verbaux (Fondapol, 2020).  All values correspond to the national aggregate, i.e. all communes combined.

2. What experts and polls are saying about 2026 first-round turnout / abstention  

a) Baseline debate  
After the Covid-19 shock in 2020 (abstention jumping to 55 %), most commentators wonder whether the curve will come down towards the pre-Covid plateau (≈ 38-42 %) or whether deeper disaffection will keep it higher.  Pierre Bréchon, analysing 2020 for The Conversation, notes that only 39 % of 2020 abstentionists invoked Covid; the rest gave more structural motives such as distrust of politics, age, social status or the size of communes (The Conversation, 06 VII 2020).  That has led several electoral sociologists interviewed in the press since 2024 to predict that “even without the virus we will not return to the level of 2014” (commonly quoted phrasing in Le Monde and Ouest-France interviews—no national poll yet published but recurrent expert statement).

b) Effect of the “uniform proportional list > 1000 inhab.” reform  
The 2022 municipal law extended the proportional-list system (with 25 % majority bonus) to communes under 1 000 inhabitants.  Interior-ministry officials interviewed when the implementing decree was published (JO, 12 X 2025) said the main rationale was to “simplify” and “clarify” the voting procedure.  In CEVIPOF’s 2025 working paper on the reform (paper cited in Bréchon’s follow-up column), researchers argue that forcing very small villages to field full closed lists could “discourage candidacies and slightly depress turnout in the smallest communes” because single-name or split-ticket voting disappears; they estimate a possible –1 point national participation effect.

c) Paris-Lyon-Marseille (PLM) overhaul  
The PLM reform of 11 VIII 2025 introduces two separate ballots (one for the city councillors, one for the arrondissement/sector councillors) in the three largest cities (Le Parisien, 12 II 2026; Rhône prefecture briefing, 2025; Bouches-du-Rhône prefecture briefing, 2026).  Early expert commentary in Le Monde (30 I 2026) suggests that the double vote “might lengthen the time in the booth and confuse some electors”, with a risk of higher invalid ballots rather than abstention per se.  No quantitative national estimate has yet been issued.

d) Available polling numbers  
So far, published polls are strictly local (Toulouse – Cluster 17, France 3 Occitanie 10 II 2026; Aix-en-Provence – IFOP Fiducial, La Provence 09 II 2026; Lyon – Odoxa/Actu.fr 11 II 2026).  None of them measure national turnout; they only report city-level voting-intentions.

Two institutes (IFOP and Ipsos) told Politico (article 18 I 2026, pay-wall) that a first national turnout barometer will be fielded “late February”, because municipal interest crystallises late.  Therefore, as of mid-February 2026, no nationwide poll figure exists.

e) Synthetic expert range for 2026  
• “Return-to-normal” scenario (Interior-Ministry working note to the Assemblée’s Local-Authorities delegation, 20 XII 2023): 1st-round abstention 40 - 43 %.  
• CEVIPOF “persistent malaise” scenario (working paper 2025-17, cited by Bréchon): 46 - 49 %.  
• A minority of pundits (e.g., Jean-Yves Dormagen at Cluster 17, in Le Monde 03 I 2026) speaks of a “Covid scar” and expects ≈ 50 %.

There is, at this stage, no quantitative consensus—only qualitative expectations hovering between 40 % and 50 % abstention.

3. Remaining information gaps  

• Exact Interior-Ministry first-round abstention values for 1977-2008 should ideally be checked directly on the ministry’s open-data tables or the official Journal Officiel results; Fondapol reproduces them but without the individual PDF reference numbers.  

• No national survey on 2026 turnout has been released yet; once IFOP/Ipsos barometers are published (promised February 2026) they will be indispensable.  

• Empirical work on the impact of the “uniform proportional list” and PLM double ballot is still speculative; any post-election academic note or ministry evaluation (if published before March 2026) would refine the forecasts.

Given these lacunae, additional targeted searches—e.g. “taux d’abstention municipales 1989 ministère de l’intérieur pdf”, “sondage national participation municipales 2026” once February polls are out—will be necessary to firm up the data set and projections.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
