Disagreement Analysis:

**Disagreement 1: Central estimate (median) of abstention rate**
- Forecasters 1, 3, 4, 5 cluster around a median of 45-46%, while Forecaster 2 centers much lower at ~41%.
- Forecaster 2 argues that removing the COVID effect and accounting for the new proportional list system (which may increase urban engagement) brings abstention back closer to the 2014 level (~38.7%) with only modest structural increase. The other four forecasters believe structural disaffection post-2024 dissolution, long-term trend, and new electoral rules (reducing small-commune personalization) push the median firmly into the mid-40s.
- This is the most impactful disagreement, representing a ~4-5 percentage point gap in the central estimate.

**Disagreement 2: Right tail / extreme abstention risk**
- Forecaster 4 places P90 at 56% (well above the 55% open upper bound center), while Forecasters 1 and 3 place P90 at 52%, Forecaster 5 at 54%, and Forecaster 2 at only 49%.
- This reflects different assessments of tail risk from potential late-breaking shocks (terrorism, political crisis, extreme weather). Forecaster 4 explicitly models a fat right tail; Forecaster 2 considers a near-repeat of 2020 levels very unlikely absent a pandemic.
- This affects the upper uncertainty band by ~7 percentage points.

**Disagreement 3: Impact of new electoral rules (uniform proportional list system)**
- Forecaster 2 believes the new PLM city-wide system and proportional lists may *increase* urban engagement (downward pressure on abstention). Forecasters 1, 3, 4, and 5 believe the uniform list system will *reduce* small-commune personalization and thus *increase* abstention in rural/small areas, with net upward pressure.
- This is a factual/empirical question about how electoral system changes affect turnout, and it contributes ~1-2 percentage points of disagreement.

Root Causes:

1. **Central estimate gap (Forecaster 2 vs. others)**: Different weighting of the same evidence. All forecasters acknowledge the 2014 baseline and post-2024 political climate, but Forecaster 2 weights the COVID removal and potential mobilization effects more heavily, while others weight structural disaffection and trend continuation more heavily. Partially factual — resolvable by finding recent polling on voter intention or expert projections specific to 2026 municipals.

2. **Right tail risk**: Different subjective assessments of tail event probability. This is largely judgment-based, though finding any specific threat assessments or historical precedent for non-pandemic shocks affecting French municipal turnout could help.

3. **Impact of new electoral rules**: Factual disagreement about the direction of effect of the uniform proportional list system on turnout. This could be partially resolved by finding expert analysis or comparative evidence from other countries/elections that switched to proportional list systems.
