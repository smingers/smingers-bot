Resolution of Disagreements:

**Disagreement 1 (Central estimate - Forecaster 2 at ~41% vs. others at ~45-46%):** The research did not find any specific polling institute projections for the national abstention rate in 2026. The Huffington Post article mentions the question of whether 2026 will revert to pre-COVID trends (38-42%) or stay higher, but doesn't resolve it. The Odoxa poll from December 2025 discusses anti-LFI/anti-RN dynamics but doesn't directly address turnout levels. The evidence on youth abstention (72% in 2020 among 18-34) and persistent structural disaffection supports the higher-abstention camp, but the absence of COVID as a deterrent supports some reversion. The research is inconclusive on this central disagreement, though the weight of evidence (persistent disaffection, post-2024 political climate, youth disengagement) leans modestly toward the higher estimates.

**Disagreement 2 (Right tail risk):** No specific evidence was found on imminent threats or shocks that would push abstention toward 55%+. Forecaster 4's P90 of 56% seems excessive given no pandemic-like event is on the horizon. The research modestly supports trimming the right tail.

**Disagreement 3 (Impact of new electoral rules):** The research confirms that the uniform proportional list system now applies to all communes, eliminating "panachage" in small communes (<1,000 inhabitants). The AMF article details how this removes the personalized candidate selection that historically drove high participation in small rural communes. A Polish study cited by the agent found PR can increase turnout by 3-4pp, but that's in a different context. The French reform specifically removes the personal connection voters had with individual candidates in small communes, which likely reduces turnout there. This supports the majority view (Forecasters 1, 3, 4, 5) that the reform has net upward pressure on abstention, though the effect is likely modest (1-2pp). The new PLM system in Paris/Lyon/Marseille could increase engagement in those cities, partially offsetting this. Net effect: slight upward pressure on abstention, supporting the majority.

Updated Analysis:

The research did not produce definitive polling data or expert projections that would clearly resolve the central disagreement. However, the balance of evidence modestly favors the higher-abstention camp (Forecasters 1, 3, 4, 5) over Forecaster 2's lower estimate:

1. The new electoral rules (elimination of panachage in small communes) are confirmed and likely reduce small-commune turnout, supporting ~1pp upward pressure on abstention.
2. Youth disengagement remains severe (72% abstention among 18-34 in 2020), and articles suggest this is a persistent structural problem.
3. The post-2024 political climate is characterized by polarization and disaffection.
4. No COVID-like shock exists, which should bring abstention well below 2020's 55%.

The weighted average currently has a median around 44-45%, which seems reasonable. However, Forecaster 2's lower estimates are pulling the distribution down somewhat. The evidence modestly supports the majority view of a median around 44-46%.

I'll adjust slightly upward from the weighted average, particularly in the lower percentiles where Forecaster 2's influence is strongest, while trimming Forecaster 4's extreme P90 of 56% which seems unsupported.

The implied median should be around 45%, reflecting: 2014 baseline (~38.7%) + structural trend (~+3-4pp) + new electoral rules (~+1pp) + post-2024 climate (~+1-2pp) - no COVID (~-0pp since we're comparing to trend, not 2020).
