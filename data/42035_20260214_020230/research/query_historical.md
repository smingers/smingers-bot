Analysis:
To build an outside view I first need a long time-series of abstention (or turnout) at French municipal elections so I can see the pre-COVID trend, the 2020 anomaly, and earlier peaks/troughs. Interior-ministry figures or INSEE tables are the standard sources, so a French-language Google query aimed at “abstention premier tour municipales 2020 2014 2008” should surface them quickly.

Next I need near-term information on whether journalists, pollsters or academics have produced turnout forecasts for 2026, or at least have reported on surveys of voting intention/interest. This is time-sensitive, so a Google News query targeting “abstention municipales 2026 sondage” is appropriate.

Finally, it would be useful to aggregate both the historic series and any new projections. An Agent query can explicitly ask for the full historical table (1977-2020) and any 2026 polling or expert commentary that discusses the likely effect of the new uniform proportional list system and the Paris/Lyon/Marseille reforms on participation.

Search queries:
1. abstention premier tour municipales 2020 2014 (Google)
2. abstention municipales 2026 sondage (Google News)
3. Provide national abstention rates for the first round of every French municipal election from 1977-2020 according to the Interior Ministry, and summarize any polling or expert projections about first-round turnout/abstention in the 2026 municipal elections, especially comments on the new uniform proportional list and Paris/Lyon/Marseille reforms.
