As of February 13, 2026, one month before the first round, 63 outgoing mayors in Maine-et-Loire have decided not to run for re-election, representing about one-third of the total. Among those choosing to run again are Christophe B\u00e9chu in Angers, Gilles Bourdouleix in Cholet, Jackie Goulet-Claisse in Saumur, Genevi\u00e8ve Coquereau in Segr\u00e9, Philippe Chalopin in Baug\u00e9-en-Anjou, and Gilles Talluau in Varennes-sur-Loire. Reasons for not seeking re-election include personal priorities such as family or professional life\u2014e.g., Didier Huchon in S\u00e8vremoine and Franck Aubin in Beaupr\u00e9au-en-Mauges\u2014having completed multiple mandates, as with Jean-Paul Olivar\u00e8s in Saint-L\u00e9ger-sous-Cholet, or age, as in the case of Marie-Madeleine Monnier in Chalonnes. Lists must be submitted to the prefecture by February 26, 2026, at 6 p.m. The information is based on a survey by Ouest-France.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 11:13 AM\nSource:[Ouest France](https://www.ouest-france.fr/elections/municipales/municipales-2026-a-quatre-semaines-du-premier-tour-votre-maire-a-t-il-decide-de-se-representer-en-maine-et-loire-dfb7aef8-082f-11f1-9c0a-f496d01f0cae)\n\n**How the First Round of the 2026 Municipal Elections in Tarn Will Be Decided: Direct Election, 10% Threshold, and Fusion Opportunities**\nIn the 2026 municipal elections in Tarn, France, a candidate who secures over 50% of the valid votes in a commune is directly elected mayor, and their list wins a majority of seats on the municipal council\u2014typically half\u2014while the remaining seats are distributed proportionally. This outcome is guaranteed in communes with only one or two candidates, particularly those with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, where the panachage rule no longer applies. If no candidate reaches 50%, the election proceeds to a second round, but only lists that receive at least 10% of the valid votes qualify. This can result in triangular, quadrangular, or even quinquangular second rounds. Additionally, lists that secured at least 5% of the votes in the first round are eligible to merge with other lists during the inter-round negotiation period, a strategic opportunity that also entitles them to a reimbursement of campaign expenses.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 09:01 AM\nSource:[Ladepeche.fr](https://www.ladepeche.fr/2026/02/13/municipales-2026-dans-le-tarn-election-directe-qualification-au-2nd-tour-opportunite-de-fusion-comment-va-se-decider-le-1er-tour-des-elections-13217587.php)\n\n**Far-Right Visibility Grows in Tarn Ahead of 2026 Municipal Elections, But Conquest of Mayors Remains Uncertain**\nThe far right has never been as visible in the Tarn department ahead of the 2026 municipal elections, with the Rassemblement National (RN) fielding mayoral candidates in major towns such as Albi (Fr\u00e9d\u00e9ric Cabrolier), Castres (Florian Azema), Graulhet (Julien Bacou), and Carmaux (Gweenael Andrieu). The far-right's influence extends to rural communes through figures like Denis Rouquette in Lescure-d'Albigeois and Alain Dauzats in R\u00e9almont, both linked to Reconqu\u00eate or the RN. A symbolic shift is seen in Bernard Carayon, the long-serving mayor of Lavaur, who has joined the UDR, aligning with the RN and signaling a broader political realignment. Graulhet stands out as the most promising site for a potential RN breakthrough due to social fractures, economic hardship, high abstention, and a strong RN base\u2014evidenced by Julien Bacou\u2019s 25.60% in the 2020 second round and near-victory in the 2024 legislative elections. However, in larger towns like Albi, Castres, and Carmaux, the RN faces entrenched political structures and stronger local opposition, with past second-round scores below 11% and Castres\u2019 2024 first-round result at 7.65%. Julien Bacou argues that consistent performance in cantonal elections (17 out of 23 second rounds) makes it 'logical' to have elected officials. Yet, local voters in the rural Tarn prioritize stability, continuity, and known figures over radical change, especially when selecting municipal leaders. While the far right has gained visibility and a militant base, its radical rhetoric risks alienating broader electorates. The most plausible outcome is steady electoral progress without a major breakthrough. The article concludes that while far-right momentum is real, local political dynamics and voter caution remain decisive.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 07:01 AM\nSource:[Ladepeche.fr](https://www.ladepeche.fr/2026/02/13/decryptage-municipales-2026-dans-le-tarn-il-serait-logique-davoir-des-elus-comment-lextreme-droite-avance-ses-pions-13220177.php)\n\n**Debout les urnes: Anti-capitalist candidates, a 'gripped system', and climate change dominate 2026 French municipal elections**\nThe article from Midi Libre provides a daily update on the 2026 French municipal elections, titled 'Debout les urnes'. The Left Alternative officially launched its candidacy in Millau, with 49-year-old teacher Dalila Belaid Artis as the lead candidate on a 35-member list promoting an 'assumed anti-capitalist' platform. The group advocates participatory democracy and the citizen-initiated referendum (RIC), opposes hospital closures in Millau and Saint-Affrique, and criticizes local management practices such as those related to the Cyclamen dossier. Four public meetings are scheduled in Millau from February 21 to March 11, and no voting instructions will be issued for the second round if the list loses. In Loupian, Mayor Alain Vidal, 75, earns approximately \u20ac1,000 net monthly\u201460% of his entitled fees\u2014supported by agricultural work and a \u20ac1,200 role in the local intercommunal authority, emphasizing that the position is not about financial gain. In Uz\u00e8s, 75-year-old podiatrist Jacques Caunan, retired, challenges 84-year-old incumbent Jean-Luc Chapon, accusing the system of being 'gripped' and the center-right majority of lacking dialogue. Caunan's apolitical list focuses on urban cleanliness (environmental brigade, composters), security (surveillance, citizen participation), and joining the regional natural park. He pledges only one term and exclusive dedication to Uz\u00e8s, aiming for renewal after over 40 years of Chapon\u2019s leadership. A Shift Project survey of 2025\u20132026 reveals that 87% of 9 out of 10 mayors and local officials are concerned about climate change, with 69% prioritizing it in their next mandate. Over 99% report experiencing climate impacts (heatwaves, floods, droughts), especially in southern and south-western regions. The survey identifies lack of resources (59%) and daily emergencies (57%) as key obstacles, with officials calling for a 'single window' to streamline access to funding and regulatory guidance.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 06:01 AM\nSource:[midilibre.fr](https://www.midilibre.fr/2026/02/13/municipales-2026-debout-les-urnes-anticapitalistes-assumes-systeme-grippe-et-changement-climatique-13221440.php)\n\n**Municipal 2026: Parity, Abstention, and Disinformation as Major Election Challenges**\nThe 2026 French municipal elections, scheduled for March 15 and 22, face three major challenges beyond political debates: gender parity, rising abstention, and disinformation. Despite a national female representation of 41.5% among over 505,000 municipal councilors, this drops to 37.6% in towns with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, and only 17.5% of mayors are women. A new law mandates gender parity in candidate lists regardless of commune size, a significant shift for campaign teams struggling to comply. Although women's representation rose by 2.3 percentage points in 2020, studies by the Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts indicate they are less likely to be re-elected, raising questions about whether parity will translate into real influence. Abstention remains a growing concern: while 2020's record-high abstention (55.3% in the first round) was skewed by the pandemic-related lockdown, historical data from 2014 (60% participation) offers a better benchmark. A high abstention rate in 2026 would signal deepening distrust in institutions, despite 58% of French citizens still expressing confidence in municipal councils. Additionally, disinformation poses a serious threat, with foreign interference\u2014particularly from a Russian-linked network since February 2024\u2014targeting the French information space through fake websites, AI-generated content, and efforts to discredit candidates, media, and the electoral process. In response, the French government established a 'network for coordination and protection of elections,' uniting Viginum and Arcom, publishing campaign guides, and releasing weekly reports on interference. The 2026 municipal elections are thus seen as a critical rehearsal for the upcoming presidential election.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 08:04 PM\nSource:[actu.fr](https://actu.fr/politique/elections-municipales/municipales-2026-abstention-parite-desinformation-les-trois-autres-enjeux-majeurs-du-scrutin_63827567.html)\n\n**Shifts in Campaign Plans and Intercommunal Power Struggles Mark 2026 Municipal Elections in Deux-S\u00e8vres**\nThe 2026 French municipal elections are intensifying in the Deux-S\u00e8vres region, with less than a month until the first round on March 15, 2026. Thierry P\u00e9trault, the main opponent of incumbent ecologist mayor St\u00e9phane Baudry of Saint-Maixent, has made the sale of the historic Canclaux barracks\u2014a former royal abbey converted into a military barracks until 2010 and now an emblematic site in the city center\u2014a central part of his campaign. P\u00e9trault argues the city lacks the financial capacity to maintain it and that selling it to a real estate investor would bring two million euros into municipal coffers, with only the cloister and chapter house remaining under public ownership. Meanwhile, incumbent mayor Gilles Pichon, representing Horizons, criticized the 2026 budget as lacking coherence and visibility, echoing a strong statement from the Association des maires de France. In Thouarsais, Sylvain Sintive, who initially announced he would not run, reversed course and declared his candidacy for a fourth term, though he pledged to serve only two years to enable a smooth transition. In Loretz-d'Argenton, two members of the outgoing mayor Pierre Sauv\u00eatre\u2019s list\u2014Catherine Sal\u00e8s and J\u00e9r\u00f4me Mureau\u2014left to join a competing list led by Alain Gourdon. In Parthenay, the mayoral race has broader implications for the intercommunal authority, with incumbent Jean-Michel Prieur, who also leads Parthenay-G\u00e2tine, seeking to retain both roles. His opponent, B\u00e9atrice Largeau, argues that a mayor of a central city should not automatically hold the presidency of an intercommunal entity, calling it a 'second election' and highlighting the interdependence between urban and rural areas. In L'Absie, a commune of 1,056 residents, two lists are running\u2014Anne-Marie Poitou and Emmanuelle Chauvin\u2014following a history of political competition, including a 2020 election with three lists and 45 candidates. The closure of the local college in 2024 may fuel debate. In Niort, the left-wing list includes nine candidates formally affiliated with political parties: two Ecologists, two from France Insoumise, two from the Socialist Party, two from the Communist Party, and one from G\u00e9n\u00e9ration.s, with the list explicitly claiming its political identity and party ties.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 06:52 PM\nSource:[lanouvellerepublique.fr](https://www.lanouvellerepublique.fr/niort/changement-de-plan-presidence-d-intercommunalite-les-echos-de-campagne-des-municipales-2026-dans-les-deux-sevres-1770922324)\n\n**If You Vote in the Municipal Elections, This Ski Resort Offers You a 50% Discount**\nIn preparation for the French municipal elections on March 15 and 22, 2026, the ski resort Les Gets-Morzine launched a campaign called 'Tous skitoyens' to combat voter abstention.

In urban centers like N\u00eemes, abstention approached 70%. The second round had a turnout of 34.67%, significantly lower than the 52.36% in 2014, with a 58% abstention rate. Regional President Carole Delga criticized the process, calling it 'a great mess' and suggesting to retain results for already-elected officials while rescheduling the remaining rounds. Despite the disruptions, the elections proceeded, leaving a lasting impression of instability.

What Remains of 2020 for the March Elections?**\nThe 2020 French municipal elections were unprecedented due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the first round held on March 15, 2020, and the second round delayed to June 28, 2020\u201415 weeks later\u2014due to nationwide lockdowns starting March 17.

This trend is illustrated by the 2014 municipal election data: Aix-en-Provence recorded a 41.01% abstention rate in the second round, Avignon 34.6%, while smaller communes like Saint-Savournin had only 28.35% abstention and Reillanne just 16.21%. These figures contrast with the national average abstention rate of 36.3%.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 06:41 AM\nSource:[LaProvence.com](https://www.laprovence.com/article/elections/13677965917366/municipales-2026-face-a-l-abstention-pourquoi-les-grandes-villes-sont-en-premiere-ligne?id=13677965917366)\n\n**Municipal 2026: What Were the Voter Turnout Rates in 2020?**\nThe 2020 French municipal elections saw a significant decline in voter turnout, with a national participation rate of 44.66% in the first round\u2014down nearly 19 percentage points from 2014\u2014and 41.86% in the second round, a drop of about 20 points compared to 2014. This decline is attributed to the challenging context of the Covid-19 pandemic during the election period. Prior to 2020, turnout in 2014 and 2008 had remained relatively high, both exceeding 60%, reflecting the historically strong voter engagement in municipal elections, which are among the most participated-in French elections alongside presidential ones. The upcoming 2026 municipal elections are scheduled for March 15 and 22, with voter turnout expected to be closely monitored as abstention continues to rise in France.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 06:17 AM\nSource:[CNEWS](https://www.cnews.fr/france/2026-02-01/municipales-2026-quels-etaient-les-taux-de-participation-en-2020-1808712)\n\n**Municipal Elections of 2020: High Abstention and Questionable Legitimacy in France**\nThe 2020 French municipal elections, held during the Covid-19 pandemic, were marked by historically high abstention rates, with 55% turnout in the first round and 60% in the second\u201440 points higher than the 1983 municipal elections and 20 points above 2014. This unprecedented drop in voter participation, attributed to lockdowns and public fear, led to a significant shift in power toward left-wing, green-leaning candidates in major cities such as Bordeaux, Marseille, Lyon, Strasbourg, and Besan\u00e7on. In Bordeaux, Pierre Hurmic won with 46% of the vote against 44% for his conservative rival, despite 68% abstention. In Marseille, the leftist list led by Rubirola won with only 35% turnout and 38% of the vote, later ceding the mayoralty to Beno\u00eet Payan\u2014a figure not elected by the public and described by Le Monde as a 'pur product of the old system' and the move labeled a 'trick' due to lack of transparency. In smaller cities like Roubaix (77.25% abstention) and Vitry-sur-Seine (77.39% abstention), elected mayors represented less than 13% and 11% of registered voters, respectively. The article argues that these results, with 57% of cities over 100,000 inhabitants under left-wing control, were illegitimate and unrepresentative, and warns that the 'atypical' nature of elections under exceptional circumstances has enabled political manipulation. The piece concludes by urging voters in the 2026 elections to vote en masse against the left and Macronism to restore democratic legitimacy.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 10:30 AM\nSource:[Boulevard Voltaire](https://www.bvoltaire.fr/municipales-ces-chiffres-dil-y-a-6-ans-a-bien-avoir-en-tete-en-votant-en-mars/)\n\n**2026 Municipal Elections in Landes: A Guide to the Key Steps Before Voting**\nIn the Landes department of France, the process for the 2026 municipal elections is outlined, with the mandatory submission of candidacies required for all lists.
