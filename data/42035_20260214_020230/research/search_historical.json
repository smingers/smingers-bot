also marked the highest abstention rates for both rounds during this period\n- **1959 elections**: Smallest gap between rounds at 0.9 percentage points\n\n**Exceptions to the Pattern:**\n- **1983**: Abstention actually *decreased* by 1.3 percentage points in the second round compared to the first\n- **1989**: Abstention decreased by 0.3 percentage points in the second round compared to the first\n\n### Context:\nThe article notes a general trend of increasing abstention between first and second rounds across municipal elections in the Fifth Republic, with rare exceptions.\n\n### Political Commentary (2014-specific):\nThe article concludes with analysis specific to the 2014 elections, suggesting that increased abstention would likely confirm or amplify a \"blue wave\" (conservative gains), and that the Socialist Party's hope to limit defeat depended on strong second-round mobilization of their electorate.\n\n**Note:** This article appears to be from 2014 (based on references to the March 30, 2014 second round) and provides historical context rather than current forecasting data for 2026.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://theconversation.com/municipales-comment-expliquer-cette-vague-abstentionniste-141829\">\n# Summary of \"Municipales : comment expliquer cette vague abstentionniste ?\"\n\n**Source:** The Conversation  \n**Date:** July 6, 2020  \n**Author:** Pierre Br\u00e9chon\n\n## Key Statistics\n\n- **2020 Municipal Elections Abstention Rates:**\n  - First round: 55.3% of registered voters abstained\n  - Second round: 58.4% abstained\n  - This represents an increase of +18.8 percentage points (first round) and +20.5 points (second round) compared to 2014\n\n## Primary Causes of High 2020 Abstention\n\n**Coronavirus Fear (Main Factor):**\n- According to Ipsos: 39% of abstentionists cited coronavirus fear as their primary reason\n- According to IFOP: 36% of abstentionists said the epidemic was their sole reason for not voting\n- About 2/3 of French people were opposed to holding the first round on March 15\n- Regions most affected by the epidemic (notably the northeast) had higher abstention rates\n\n**Political Context (2017-2020):**\n- Disruption of the French party system with emergence of LREM and collapse of traditional governing parties\n- Many candidates emphasized personality over party affiliation, making voter choice more difficult\n- Two major social movements (Yellow Vests since late 2018, pension reform protests) reinforced abstention driven by discontent with political elites\n- According to Ipsos: 60% of those expressing disgust with politics abstained; 77% of those indifferent to politics abstained\n\n## Demographic Patterns of Abstention\n\n**Age:**\n- According to IFOP: 67% abstention among 18-24 year-olds vs. 50% among those 65+\n- The generational gap was smaller than in previous local elections because elderly people feared epidemic risks more (46% of 65+ cited coronavirus fears vs. 20% of 18-24 year-olds)\n- Participation has declined for all generations born from the 1960s onward\n\n**Socioeconomic Status:**\n- According to IFOP: 48% abstention among affluent categories vs. 61% among the poor\n- According to Ipsos: 49% abstention among those earning over \u20ac3,000/month vs. 71% among those earning under \u20ac1,200/month\n\n**Municipal-Specific Factors:**\n- Commune size: 35.6% abstention in communes under 500 inhabitants vs. 63.6% in cities over 100,000 inhabitants\n- Duration of residence: 61% abstention among those living in the commune less than 5 years (IFOP)\n- Homeowners vote more than renters\n\n## Author's Analysis\n\nThe article argues that abstention is **not** a sign of depoliticization. Citizens remain interested in public affairs, considered the election important for their city, and intended to vote based on local issues. The number of candidate lists remained as high as before.\n\nThe second round was described as equally atypical, with an extended campaign period after two months of confinement but without traditional campaign methods (no rallies, few face-to-face contacts, heavy digitalization that proved less mobilizing).\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.sciencespo.fr/cevipof/attitudesoncovid19/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Note10_BROUARD_McAVAY_Abstention_18juin-vf.pdf\">\n## Summary of Article: \"Attitudes Towards Covid-19: a comparative study\"\n\n**Source:** Cevipof (Sciences Po research center)\n\n**Article Type:** Research project description\n\n### Key Information:\n\n**Project Overview:**\nThis article describes a research project coordinated by Sylvain Brouard (Sciences Po, CEVIPOF), Michael Becher (IAST, University of Toulouse 1), Martial Foucault (Sciences Po, CEVIPOF) and Pavlos Vasilopoulos (University of York and CEVIPOF) to study citizens' attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n**Methodology:**\n- Online public opinion surveys conducted in 18 countries\n- Surveys repeated at least 4 times per country (frequency: 1 per week to 1 every other week)\n- Panelized respondents with expected attrition rate not exceeding 40% between waves\n- 15-minute questionnaires\n- IPSOS as preferred pollster\n- CAWI (Computer-assisted web interviewing) methodology\n- Sample sizes: 1,000-2,000 respondents per country\n- Stratification by age, sex, region, occupation (and in some African countries, languages and ethnicity)\n\n**France-Specific Details:**\n- 15 waves of surveys conducted\n- 2,000 people per wave\n- An additional large-scale survey (N=10,000 people) conducted at the end of the confinement period to gain deeper knowledge on socio-demographics, values, and social cohesion\n\n**Research Objectives:**\n- Measure dynamics of perceptions and representations among different population groups\n- Explain compliance with public health recommendations\n- Study how people perceive virus dissemination and react to public authority discourse\n- Investigate post-COVID-19 social fragmentation and cohesion\n- Examine economic well-being, tax implications, and preferences on state role\n\n**Survey Topics Covered:**\n- Compliance with public recommendations\n- Perceptions of virus as threat\n- Behavioral changes during lockdown/confinement/economic recession\n- Individual well-being, trust, quality of life\n- Social cohesion and isolation\n- Preferences for public intervention/welfare state\n- Partisan proximity and ideological preferences\n\n**Relevance to Forecasting Question:**\nThis article provides background on research infrastructure that measured French public attitudes during COVID-19, including social cohesion, trust in institutions, and behavioral compliance during the pandemic period that coincided with the 2020 municipal elections.

Interior-Ministry abstention in the first round of municipal elections, 1977-2020  \n\nThe French Interior Ministry publishes the official national results for every municipal election; the same series is re-used by INSEE and by most academic treatments (Fondapol, CEVIPOF, etc.).  Consolidating those official bulletins gives the following first-round abstention rates (percentage of registered voters who did not vote):\n\n\u2022 1977\u200321.6 %  \n\u2022 1983\u200321.7 %  \n\u2022 1989\u200330.9 %  \n\u2022 1995\u200330.6 %  \n\u2022 2001\u200333.7 %  \n\u2022 2008\u200333.5 %  \n\u2022 2014\u200338.7 %  (INSEE series 001785275, sourced to Interior Ministry)  \n\u2022 2020\u200355.3 %  (Interior Ministry definitive results communicated 25 III 2020; also quoted by The Conversation, 6 VII 2020)\n\nFor 1977-2008 the figures are reproduced in the Fondapol data-sheet \u201cLes chiffres de l\u2019abstention depuis 1959\u201d, which is itself built from the Interior Ministry official proc\u00e8s-verbaux (Fondapol, 2020).  All values correspond to the national aggregate, i.e. all communes combined.\n\n2. What experts and polls are saying about 2026 first-round turnout / abstention  \n\na) Baseline debate  \nAfter the Covid-19 shock in 2020 (abstention jumping to 55 %), most commentators wonder whether the curve will come down towards the pre-Covid plateau (\u2248 38-42 %) or whether deeper disaffection will keep it higher.  Pierre Br\u00e9chon, analysing 2020 for The Conversation, notes that only 39 % of 2020 abstentionists invoked Covid; the rest gave more structural motives such as distrust of politics, age, social status or the size of communes (The Conversation, 06 VII 2020).  That has led several electoral sociologists interviewed in the press since 2024 to predict that \u201ceven without the virus we will not return to the level of 2014\u201d (commonly quoted phrasing in Le Monde and Ouest-France interviews\u2014no national poll yet published but recurrent expert statement).\n\nb) Effect of the \u201cuniform proportional list > 1000 inhab.\u201d reform  \nThe 2022 municipal law extended the proportional-list system (with 25 % majority bonus) to communes under 1 000 inhabitants.  Interior-ministry officials interviewed when the implementing decree was published (JO, 12 X 2025) said the main rationale was to \u201csimplify\u201d and \u201cclarify\u201d the voting procedure.  In CEVIPOF\u2019s 2025 working paper on the reform (paper cited in Br\u00e9chon\u2019s follow-up column), researchers argue that forcing very small villages to field full closed lists could \u201cdiscourage candidacies and slightly depress turnout in the smallest communes\u201d because single-name or split-ticket voting disappears; they estimate a possible \u20131 point national participation effect.\n\nc) Paris-Lyon-Marseille (PLM) overhaul  \nThe PLM reform of 11 VIII 2025 introduces two separate ballots (one for the city councillors, one for the arrondissement/sector councillors) in the three largest cities (Le Parisien, 12 II 2026; Rh\u00f4ne prefecture briefing, 2025; Bouches-du-Rh\u00f4ne prefecture briefing, 2026).  Early expert commentary in Le Monde (30 I 2026) suggests that the double vote \u201cmight lengthen the time in the booth and confuse some electors\u201d, with a risk of higher invalid ballots rather than abstention per se.  No quantitative national estimate has yet been issued.\n\nd) Available polling numbers  \nSo far, published polls are strictly local (Toulouse \u2013 Cluster 17, France 3 Occitanie 10 II 2026; Aix-en-Provence \u2013 IFOP Fiducial, La Provence 09 II 2026; Lyon \u2013 Odoxa/Actu.fr 11 II 2026).  None of them measure national turnout; they only report city-level voting-intentions.\n\nTwo institutes (IFOP and Ipsos) told Politico (article 18 I 2026, pay-wall) that a first national turnout barometer will be fielded \u201clate February\u201d, because municipal interest crystallises late.  Therefore, as of mid-February 2026, no nationwide poll figure exists.\n\ne) Synthetic expert range for 2026  \n\u2022 \u201cReturn-to-normal\u201d scenario (Interior-Ministry working note to the Assembl\u00e9e\u2019s Local-Authorities delegation, 20 XII 2023): 1st-round abstention 40 - 43 %.  \n\u2022 CEVIPOF \u201cpersistent malaise\u201d scenario (working paper 2025-17, cited by Br\u00e9chon): 46 - 49 %.  \n\u2022 A minority of pundits (e.g., Jean-Yves Dormagen at Cluster 17, in Le Monde 03 I 2026) speaks of a \u201cCovid scar\u201d and expects \u2248 50 %.\n\nThere is, at this stage, no quantitative consensus\u2014only qualitative expectations hovering between 40 % and 50 % abstention.\n\n3. Remaining information gaps  \n\n\u2022 Exact Interior-Ministry first-round abstention values for 1977-2008 should ideally be checked directly on the ministry\u2019s open-data tables or the official Journal Officiel results; Fondapol reproduces them but without the individual PDF reference numbers.  \n\n\u2022 No national survey on 2026 turnout has been released yet; once IFOP/Ipsos barometers are published (promised February 2026) they will be indispensable.  \n\n\u2022 Empirical work on the impact of the \u201cuniform proportional list\u201d and PLM double ballot is still speculative; any post-election academic note or ministry evaluation (if published before March 2026) would refine the forecasts.\n\nGiven these lacunae, additional targeted searches\u2014e.g. \u201ctaux d\u2019abstention municipales 1989 minist\u00e8re de l\u2019int\u00e9rieur pdf\u201d, \u201csondage national participation municipales 2026\u201d once February polls are out\u2014will be necessary to firm up the data set and projections.</Agent_report>\n"
