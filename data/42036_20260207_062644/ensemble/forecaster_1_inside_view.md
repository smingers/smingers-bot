### 3. Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE:**

1. **Mechanical Certainty of Inter-Meeting Period:**
   - Last FOMC meeting: January 28, 2026 (set rate at 3.5-3.75%)
   - Next FOMC meeting: March 17-18, 2026
   - **February 28, 2026 falls between these meetings**
   - Historical pattern: Fed only changes rates at scheduled FOMC meetings
   - Emergency inter-meeting changes: Extremely rare (~1-2% of periods, only during acute crises)

2. **Multiple Independent Sources Confirming January Decision:**
   - CNBC, Fox Business, CBS News, Alpha-Forex all confirm 3.5-3.75% range
   - No contradictory information found
   - FRED data shows effective rate at 3.64%, consistent with 3.5-3.75% range

3. **Absence of Crisis Indicators:**
   - Fed characterizes economy as "on firm footing"
   - GDP growth strong (4.4% Q3, tracking 5.4% Q4)
   - Unemployment stable at 4.4%
   - No financial market stress
   - ISM Manufacturing at 52.6 (expansion territory)

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**

1. **Fed Official Guidance Against Near-Term Cuts:**
   - Powell: No March cuts expected (per Alpha-Forex)
   - Jefferson: Rates "in neutral range," higher bar for cuts
   - Market pricing: 82% probability of hold at March meeting

2. **Inflation Still Above Target:**
   - Core PCE at 3% (vs 2% target)
   - Provides rationale against emergency cuts
   - But also argues against emergency hikes

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

1. **Political Uncertainty:**
   - Warsh nomination creates uncertainty
   - DOJ investigation of Powell (per CBS)
   - However: These don't affect February 28 outcome (before next meeting)

2. **Market Expectations for Year-End:**
   - CME FedWatch shows modal outcome at 3.0-3.25% by November
   - Irrelevant for February 28 prediction (too far out)

### 4. Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 21 days from today (February 7 → February 28, 2026)

**Critical Insight:** This is fundamentally NOT a question about Fed policy direction, but about whether an emergency inter-meeting rate change will occur.

**If Timeframe Halved (10-11 days):** No material change - still between FOMC meetings
**If Timeframe Doubled (42 days):** Would extend past March 17-18 FOMC meeting, dramatically changing the analysis. Would need to forecast March meeting outcome (18% probability of cut per CME FedWatch).

### 5. Justification and Distribution Calibration

**Base Rate Establishment:**
- Emergency inter-meeting rate changes since 1994: ~4 events in ~250 inter-meeting periods = **1.6% base rate**
- All occurred during acute crises: 9/11 (2001), Financial Crisis (2008), COVID (March 2020), possibly one other

**Current Situation Assessment:**
- **No crisis present:** Economy strong, markets stable, no systemic risks identified
- **Fed guidance stable:** Officials signal patience, no urgency
- **Institutional inertia:** Fed values predictability, avoids surprising markets

**Probability Distribution:**
- **Status Quo (3.75%):** 98.5%
- **Emergency Cut to 3.50%:** 1.0% (would require sudden severe crisis)
- **Emergency Cut to 3.25%:** 0.4% (would require catastrophic crisis)
- **Emergency Hike to 4.00%:** 0.1% (would require inflation shock + crisis response)

**Distribution Construction Logic:**

Given 98.5% probability mass at 3.75%, the challenge is representing this extreme concentration while maintaining percentile ordering:

- **P10-P60:** Should cluster tightly around 3.75%
- **P80-P90:** Should allow minimal tail risk for emergency cuts
- Must avoid artificial smoothing that misrepresents the true probability mass

**Calibration Approach:**
- P10-P40: Very tight around 3.75% (reflecting 70%+ cumulative probability)
- P60: At 3.75% (reflecting modal outcome)
- P80: Slight allowance for measurement uncertainty or data reporting issues
- P90: Small tail risk for emergency cut scenario

### Forecasting Checklist

**1. Target Variable:** Upper bound of Fed Funds Target Range on Feb 28, 2026 (percent).
✓ Analysis focuses precisely on this, not on policy direction or year-end forecasts.

**2. Outside View Base Rate:** 1.6% for emergency inter-meeting changes; 98.4% for status quo.
✓ Final prediction heavily weighted to status quo (3.75%), with minimal tail risk.

**3. Consistency Check:**
- Implied median = 3.75%
- Implied mean ≈ 3.745% (accounting for small downside tail)
- **Makes sense:** Overwhelming probability at 3.75%, tiny downside tail from emergency cut scenarios.

**4. Three Most Significant Evidence Pieces:**
1. **February 28 falls between FOMC meetings (Jan 28 & Mar 17-18)** - Factually verified via multiple sources
2. **January 28 FOMC set rate at 3.5-3.75%** - Confirmed by CNBC, Fox Business, CBS, Alpha-Forex
3. **No crisis indicators present; Fed officials signal patience** - Jefferson statement, Powell guidance, economic data

**5. Blind-Spot Statement:**
**Most likely scenario to make forecast wrong:** Sudden financial crisis (bank failure, geopolitical shock, market crash) in next 21 days triggers emergency FOMC meeting and rate cut. This would push outcome DOWN to 3.50% or 3.25%. Probability: ~1.5%.

### Final Distribution Reasoning

The extreme concentration of probability at 3.75% creates a challenge: how to represent 98.5% probability at a single value across six percentiles while maintaining strict ordering?

**Strategy:**
- Use minimal spreads (0.01-0.02%) for P10-P60 to reflect concentration
- P80: Slight widening to acknowledge data/measurement uncertainty
- P90: Meaningful tail allowance for black swan emergency cut

**Verification:**
- Does P40 < P60? Yes (3.745 < 3.75)
- Does distribution reflect 98.5% at 3.75%? Approximately - most percentiles at/near 3.75%
- Are tails appropriately sized? Yes - minimal downside tail, virtually no upside tail
