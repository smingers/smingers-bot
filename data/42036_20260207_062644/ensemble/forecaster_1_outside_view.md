  - Cumulative probability for upper bound ≤3.25% by November: ~66%
  - Probability for upper bound ≥3.50% by November: ~34%

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Fed rate paths during normalization cycles (2004-2006, 2015-2019)**
   - Suitability: Medium - these were hiking cycles, not cutting cycles
   - Pattern: Gradual 25bp moves at predictable intervals

2. **Fed rate paths during easing cycles with inflation concerns (1995, 2019)**
   - Suitability: High - "mid-cycle adjustments" with soft landings
   - Pattern: 2-3 cuts totaling 75bp, then pause
   - 1995: Cut from 6% to 5.25% over 7 months, then held
   - 2019: Cut from 2.5% to 1.75% over 4 months, then held

3. **Post-hiking-cycle normalization (current situation)**
   - Suitability: Very High - most directly applicable
   - Current context: Fed peaked at 5.5%, cut 1.75pp to 3.75%, now pausing
   - Pattern suggests: Gradual descent toward neutral rate (estimated 2.5-3.5%)

**Chosen Reference Class:** Post-hiking-cycle normalization with inflation still above target, similar to 2019 but with higher starting point.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 21 days from today (February 7 to February 28, 2026)

**FOMC Meeting Schedule:**
- Last meeting: January 28, 2026 (10 days ago) - held at 3.5-3.75%
- Next meeting: March 17-18, 2026 (38-39 days from today)
- **Critical insight: February 28, 2026 falls BETWEEN FOMC meetings**

This means the rate on February 28, 2026 will be whatever was set at the January 28, 2026 meeting, which we know was 3.5-3.75% (upper bound = 3.75%).

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**
- The Fed only changes rates at scheduled FOMC meetings (8 per year)
- Emergency inter-meeting rate changes are extremely rare (last occurred March 2020 during COVID crisis)
- January 2026 meeting resulted in a hold decision
- Market expects 82% probability of another hold at March meeting

## (d) Justification

**Key Reasoning:**

1. **Mechanical Certainty:** The upper bound of the Federal Funds Target Range on February 28, 2026 will almost certainly be 3.75%, because:
   - This was set at the January 28, 2026 meeting (confirmed by multiple sources)
   - February 28 falls before the next scheduled FOMC meeting (March 17-18)
   - The Fed does not change rates between scheduled meetings except in extreme emergencies

2. **Emergency Change Risk Assessment:**
   - Historical frequency: ~0.1% of inter-meeting periods see emergency changes
   - Last occurrence: March 2020 (COVID crisis)
   - Current conditions: Economy described as "on firm footing," no crisis indicators
   - Powell stated policy is "not on a preset course" but gave no indication of urgency

3. **Tail Risk Scenarios:**
   - **Upside (rate increase):** Virtually impossible - would require major inflation shock AND emergency meeting, probability <0.01%
   - **Downside (rate decrease):** Would require severe economic/financial crisis AND emergency meeting, probability ~0.1-0.5%
   - **Status quo:** Probability ~99.5%

4. **Market Validation:**
   - CME FedWatch shows 82% hold probability for March meeting
   - No pricing for inter-meeting moves in fed funds futures
   - 2-year Treasury yield stable at 3.46%, consistent with gradual easing path

Outside view calibration:

Given the mechanical nature of this question (date falls between FOMC meetings), this is fundamentally a question about whether an emergency FOMC meeting will occur in the next 21 days.

**Base Rate for Emergency Meetings:**
- Since 1994 (modern FOMC framework): ~4 emergency inter-meeting rate changes in ~250 inter-meeting periods = 1.6% base rate
- Most occurred during acute crises (9/11, 2008 financial crisis, March 2020 COVID)

**Current Situation Adjustment:**
- No crisis indicators present
- Fed explicitly stated economy is "on firm footing"
- Inflation still above target argues against emergency cuts
- Political pressure exists but Fed maintains independence

**Distribution Construction:**
- Central case (99%): Upper bound remains at 3.75%
- Emergency cut scenario (0.9%): Upper bound drops to 3.50% or 3.25%
- Emergency hike scenario (0.1%): Upper bound rises to 4.00%

The distribution should be extremely concentrated around 3.75% with minimal tail risk.

**Percentile Calibration Logic:**
- P10-P80: Should all be at or very near 3.75% (the overwhelmingly likely outcome)
- P90: Should allow for small probability of emergency cut to 3.50%
- Must maintain strict ordering while reflecting the concentrated probability mass

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.70
Percentile 20: 3.73
Percentile 40: 3.75
Percentile 60: 3.75
Percentile 80: 3.75
Percentile 90: 3.76
