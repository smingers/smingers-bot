## COMPREHENSIVE FORECAST ANALYSIS

### 1. FORECASTING CHECKLIST

**Target Variable:** Upper bound of Federal Funds Target Range on February 28, 2026 (in percent)

**Outside View Base Rate:** Current upper bound is 3.75% (as of January 28, 2026 FOMC decision). With no scheduled FOMC meeting between now (Feb 7) and Feb 28, the rate should remain unchanged absent emergency action.

**Consistency Check:** Implied median = 3.75%; mean = 3.74%; This makes sense given the 21-day window with no scheduled meeting and stable economic conditions.

**Three Most Significant Evidence Pieces:**
1. No FOMC meeting scheduled between Feb 7-28, 2026 (next meeting March 17-18)
2. Current rate confirmed at 3.5-3.75% range (upper bound 3.75%) per January 28, 2026 FOMC statement
3. Economic conditions stable: "solid pace" growth, inflation "somewhat elevated" but not crisis-level, labor market "cool but stable"

**Blind-spot Scenario:** Unforeseen financial crisis or geopolitical shock requiring emergency inter-meeting rate cut (would push outcome DOWN to 3.50% or lower).

## (b) EVIDENCE ANALYSIS

### STRONG EVIDENCE (Large confidence in base case)

1. **No FOMC Meeting Until March 17-18, 2026**
   - Multiple sources confirm next meeting date
   - Fed does not change rates between meetings except in emergencies
   - Historical pattern: Inter-meeting changes <1% of time in stable conditions
   - **Impact:** 95%+ probability rate remains 3.75%

2. **Current Economic Stability**
   - GDP growth strong (4.4% Q3, 5.4% Q4 tracking per CNBC)
   - Unemployment stable at 4.4%
   - Inflation elevated (2.9% PCE) but not accelerating
   - Labor market "cool but stable" per multiple sources
   - **Impact:** No crisis conditions requiring emergency action

3. **Explicit Fed Guidance**
   - Powell: policy is "appropriate" (Jan 28)
   - Jefferson: rates "broadly in the range of neutral" (Feb 6)
   - Statement removed language about labor market risks
   - **Impact:** Fed comfortable with current stance; no urgency to move

4. **Market Expectations Alignment**
   - CME FedWatch: 82% probability of hold at March meeting
   - 90% probability of pause per Alpha-Forex (Feb 7)
   - Futures markets price "at most two cuts in 2026"
   - **Impact:** Market consensus = no February change

### MODERATE EVIDENCE

1. **Dissenting Votes at January Meeting**
   - Miran and Waller voted for 25bp cut
   - Shows some internal Fed desire for easing
   - **Impact:** Minimal - dissents are common, majority rules, and no meeting scheduled anyway

2. **Inflation Above Target**
   - PCE at 2.9% vs 2% target
   - Core inflation 3% per BlackRock
   - **Impact:** Supports holding pattern, argues against emergency cuts

### WEAK EVIDENCE

1. **Political Pressure/Leadership Transition**
   - Powell's term ends May 2026
   - Warsh nominated as successor
   - Trump previously called for lower rates
   - **Impact:** Very minimal - Fed maintains independence, and no meeting scheduled

2. **International Monetary Policy Divergence**
   - ECB held at 2.15% (Feb 5)
   - RBA raised to 3.85% (Feb 3)
   - **Impact:** Minimal - Fed focuses on US conditions

## (c) TIMEFRAME ANALYSIS

**Prediction Timeframe:** 21 days (February 7 to February 28, 2026)

**Critical Structural Factor:** The resolution date falls in a "dead zone" between FOMC meetings. The January 28 meeting just concluded; the next meeting is March 17-18.

**If Timeframe Halved (10-11 days to ~Feb 17-18):**
- Outcome identical: still no FOMC meeting
- Probability of emergency action even lower (less time for crisis to develop)
- Confidence in 3.75% would increase to 98%+

**If Timeframe Doubled (42 days to ~March 20):**
- Would include March 17-18 FOMC meeting
- Probability distribution would widen significantly
- 3.50% (one 25bp cut) would become modal outcome (~40-50% probability)
- 3.25% (two cuts) would have 10-15% probability
- 3.75% (hold) would drop to 30-40% probability
- Distribution would be genuinely uncertain

**Key Insight:** The 21-day window is uniquely constraining. It's long enough that we can't predict to the hour, but short enough that institutional constraints (no meeting) dominate all other factors.

## (d) JUSTIFICATION & CALIBRATION

### Base Rate Justification

**Starting Point:** Current upper bound = 3.75%

**Primary Mechanism:** Federal Reserve changes the federal funds target range only at scheduled FOMC meetings (8 per year) or in extraordinary emergencies. With no meeting scheduled between Feb 7-28, the rate remains constant unless an emergency occurs.

**Emergency Action Probability Assessment:**

Historical frequency of inter-meeting actions:
- 1990-2020: ~5 emergency actions in 30 years = ~0.5% per month
- These occurred during: 9/11 (2001), Financial Crisis (2008), COVID-19 (March 2020)
- Current conditions: No crisis indicators in any source

**Probability Estimate for Emergency Cut:**
- Base historical rate: 0.5% per month
- Current stable conditions: Divide by factor of 3-5
- **Final estimate: 0.1-0.2% probability of emergency action in 21 days**

### Distribution Construction

**Central Case (97-98% probability):** Rate remains 3.75%

**Downside Tail (2-3% probability):** Emergency cut occurs
- Most likely: 25bp cut to 3.50% (1.5% probability)
- Possible: 50bp cut to 3.25% (0.5% probability)
- Extreme: Larger cut to 3.00% or below (0.2% probability)

**Upside Tail:** Effectively zero - no scenario for emergency rate increase

### Percentile Calibration Strategy

Given the extreme concentration around 3.75%, I need to balance:
1. Reflecting the overwhelming base case (3.75%)
2. Acknowledging genuine uncertainty about tail risks
3. Avoiding artificial smoothing that misrepresents the true discrete distribution

**Approach:**
- Percentiles 20-90: All at 3.75% (reflects 70% probability mass)
- Percentile 10: Slightly lower to capture downside tail risk
- This creates realistic asymmetry (downside risk exists, upside doesn't)

**Comparison to Outside View:**
My initial outside view had percentiles 20-90 all at 3.75%, with 10th at 3.50%. Upon deeper analysis:
- The 3.50% at 10th percentile implies ~10% chance of emergency cut
- Historical data + current conditions suggest <2% chance
- **Adjustment:** 10th percentile should be closer to 3.75%, perhaps 3.65-3.70%

**Final Calibration Logic:**
- 10th percentile = 3.65%: Captures extreme downside (emergency 25bp cut), but reflects its low probability
- 20th-90th percentiles = 3.75%: Reflects overwhelming base case
- This creates a distribution with 80% mass at exactly 3.75%, ~18% at 3.75±0.05%, and ~2% in deeper tails

### Verification Against Evidence

**Does this distribution match the evidence?**
- ✓ Reflects no scheduled meeting (strongest evidence)
- ✓ Reflects stable economic conditions (strong evidence)
- ✓ Reflects Fed guidance of comfort with current stance (strong evidence)
- ✓ Matches market expectations (strong evidence)
- ✓ Allows for tail risk without overstating it (appropriate uncertainty)

**Blind Spot Check:**
My forecast looks silly if: Major financial crisis or geopolitical shock in next 21 days → emergency Fed cut
- Direction: Would push outcome DOWN to 3.50% or lower
- Mitigation: 10th percentile at 3.65% provides some cushion
- Assessment: This is the right tail risk to worry about, and I've allocated appropriate (small) probability
