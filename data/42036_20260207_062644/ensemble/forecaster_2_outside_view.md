## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Post-peak Fed easing cycles (1980-present)**: Historical Fed rate-cutting campaigns
   - Suitability: Moderate - each cycle has unique characteristics
   
2. **Recent Fed policy path (2022-2026)**: The current tightening-then-easing cycle
   - Suitability: High - most relevant recent context
   
3. **Market-implied probabilities from Fed futures**: CME FedWatch Tool predictions
   - Suitability: Very High - directly applicable, incorporates all available information

**Selected Reference Class:** Market-implied probabilities from Fed futures (CME FedWatch), supplemented by the current Fed policy trajectory (2022-2026).

Rationale: Fed futures markets aggregate expert opinion, economic data, and Fed communications. They represent the most informed real-time forecast available. The current cycle provides essential context: Fed raised rates from near-zero to 5.25-5.5% (2022-2023), held for extended period, then began cutting in late 2025 (total 1.75 pp cuts to reach current 3.5-3.75%).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 21 days (February 7 to February 28, 2026)

**Key Consideration:** No scheduled FOMC meeting between now and February 28, 2026. The next meeting is March 17-18, 2026.

**Implication:** The rate on February 28, 2026 will almost certainly be whatever rate is currently in effect (3.75%, the upper bound), unless there's an emergency inter-meeting cut (extremely rare and only occurs during crises).

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**
- Emergency inter-meeting cuts are exceptionally rare (last occurred March 2020 during COVID-19 pandemic onset)
- Between scheduled meetings, the Fed funds rate remains constant
- Current economic conditions (per sources): "economy on firm footing," "growing at a solid pace," no crisis indicators

**Critical Insight:** The question asks for the rate on February 28, 2026, NOT after the March meeting. This is a 21-day window with no scheduled meeting.

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Assessment:**
The current upper bound is 3.75% (effective since the January 2026 FOMC meeting). With no FOMC meeting scheduled between February 7 and February 28, 2026, the rate will remain at 3.75% unless:

1. **Emergency inter-meeting cut occurs** (probability < 1%): Would require severe economic crisis
2. **Current rate continues** (probability > 99%): Standard scenario

**Supporting Evidence:**
- All sources confirm economy is stable ("firm footing," "solid pace")
- Inflation remains above target but not accelerating dangerously
- Labor market "cool but stable"
- No crisis signals in any reporting
- Fed explicitly stated policy is "not on a preset course" and will be "meeting-by-meeting"
- Market expectations (CME FedWatch) show 82% probability of no change at March meeting

**Key Uncertainty Factors:**
- Unforeseen economic shock (geopolitical, financial crisis, etc.)
- Extreme data surprises in next 3 weeks
- These are tail risks, not base case scenarios

The overwhelming probability is that February 28, 2026 will see the same 3.75% upper bound that exists today.

Outside view calibration:

The question resolution date (February 28, 2026) falls between FOMC meetings, with the next meeting scheduled for March 17-18, 2026. This creates an extremely high-confidence scenario: absent an emergency inter-meeting action, the rate remains unchanged.

**Distribution Considerations:**

1. **Central tendency:** Should be tightly clustered around 3.75%
2. **Downside risk:** Small probability of emergency cut to 3.50% (one 25bp cut)
3. **Upside risk:** Virtually zero probability of increase (contradicts all Fed guidance)
4. **Extreme tails:** Emergency cuts larger than 25bp would require unprecedented crisis

**Historical Context for Inter-meeting Actions:**
- Occur less than 1% of the time in stable economic conditions
- Recent example: March 2020 (COVID crisis) - two emergency cuts totaling 150bp
- Before that: 2008 financial crisis

**Calibration Strategy:**
- Place 80% probability mass at exactly 3.75%
- Allow 15% probability for one emergency cut to 3.50%
- Allow 4% for larger emergency action (multiple cuts)
- Allow 1% for unexpected scenarios

**Percentile Mapping:**
Given the discrete nature of Fed rate changes (25bp increments) and the overwhelming likelihood of no change:
- 10th-80th percentiles: Should all be at or very near 3.75%
- 90th percentile: Slight allowance for tail risk, but still close to current rate

The distribution should be extremely narrow, reflecting the near-certainty that no FOMC meeting = no rate change.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.50
Percentile 20: 3.75
Percentile 40: 3.75
Percentile 60: 3.75
Percentile 80: 3.75
Percentile 90: 3.75
