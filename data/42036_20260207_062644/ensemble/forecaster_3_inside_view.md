### 1) Target / resolution criterion (paraphrase)
Upper bound (percent) of the **FOMC federal funds target range** in effect on **February 28, 2026** (per Fed Implementation Note / FRED DFEDTARU).

---

## (a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; what’s fact vs opinion)

1) **CNBC (Jan 28, 2026)**  
- **Facts:** FOMC **held** target range at **3.50%–3.75%** (upper bound **3.75%**); 10–2 vote; markets expect no move until at least June (per article).  
- **Opinion:** Market-path commentary (“at most two cuts in 2026”).  
- **Quality/date:** High quality, timely, and directly about the target range.

2) **Fed statement coverage / reprints (e.g., UDN, Xinhua/China Daily summaries, Jan 28–29, 2026)**  
- **Facts:** Reproduce/echo the official decision: target range **3.50%–3.75%**.  
- **Opinion:** Minimal; mostly descriptive.  
- **Quality/date:** High for the core fact (the decision); secondary sources but consistent.

3) **Yahoo Finance (Feb 6, 2026) — Jefferson remarks**  
- **Facts:** Jefferson says policy is broadly near **neutral**; “higher bar for cuts”; data-dependent.  
- **Opinion/interpretation:** His assessment of the stance and outlook.  
- **Quality/date:** High; identifiable policymaker; relevant for inter-meeting action likelihood.

4) **YCharts (updated Feb 6, 2026) & Fed H.15 (Feb 5, 2026)**  
- **Facts:** Effective fed funds rate around **3.64%** (consistent day-to-day).  
- **Limits:** This is **effective**, not the target-range upper bound, but it corroborates that the target regime is stable.  
- **Quality/date:** High for the effective rate, indirect for the question.

5) **BlackRock iShares outlook (Dec 15, 2025)**  
- **Facts:** States then-current range **3.50%–3.75%**; cites SEP dispersion.  
- **Opinion:** Their 2026 outlook (pause early 2026; 1–2 cuts after new chair).  
- **Quality/date:** Reputable institution but **not** an official forecast; dated and promotional—moderate weight.

6) **NerdWallet (Feb 3, 2026)**  
- **Facts:** Fed paused at Jan meeting; mortgage-rate commentary. Mentions political developments (Warsh nomination).  
- **Opinion:** “Flat rates” expectations.  
- **Quality/date:** Useful context but not decisive for a Feb 28 target-range value.

7) **Fox Business (Jan 2026)**  
- **Issue:** Appears internally inconsistent on the actual target range (mentions **4.25–4.50** while others/official decision indicate **3.50–3.75**).  
- **Quality/date:** Because of apparent factual inconsistency, I give it **low weight** on the numeric level.

## (b) Evidence analysis with weighting (what matters for Feb 28 specifically)

### Strong evidence (large weight)
1) **Structural/time-to-resolution + FOMC calendar logic:**  
- Today is **Feb 7, 2026**; resolution is **Feb 28, 2026** (~21 days).  
- **No scheduled FOMC meeting** occurs between Jan 28 decision and Feb 28; next is mid-March.  
- Therefore, absent an **emergency inter-meeting action**, the upper bound stays **3.75%**.  
This is the single strongest driver.

2) **Official/near-official confirmation of current setting:**  
- Multiple high-quality sources agree the current target range is **3.50%–3.75%**.

### Moderate evidence (medium weight)
3) **Fed communications tilt against urgent cuts:**  
- Jefferson: higher bar for cuts, policy near neutral. This reduces already-low odds of an emergency cut.

4) **Macro backdrop not crisis-like:**  
- Inflation somewhat elevated (~2.7–3%); unemployment ~4.4%; growth not collapsing.  
This makes emergency action less likely.

### Weak evidence (small adjustments)
5) **Market commentary on later-2026 cuts / chair transition politics:**  
- Potentially relevant to March+ meetings, but weakly relevant to **Feb 28** unless it triggers a shock.

**Net implication:** The distribution for Feb 28 is extremely concentrated at **3.75%**, with small tail risk for an emergency move.

---

## (c) Timeframe analysis (and sensitivity)
- **Time until outcome:** ~**21 days**.
- **If halved (~10 days):** even closer to mechanical certainty of no change; tails shrink further.
- **If doubled (~42 days):** would likely cross the **March** meeting window; then odds of a cut would rise materially and the median could drift down toward **3.50%** (depending on data).

---

## (d) Justification (updating the outside view)
### Outside view baseline
In periods **between scheduled FOMC meetings**, the target range almost always remains unchanged; inter-meeting moves are rare and typically crisis-driven (e.g., 2008, March 2020).

### Inside view adjustments from current information
- Current target upper bound is clearly **3.75%** (multi-source agreement).
- Fed rhetoric (Jefferson) suggests **no urgency** to cut.
- No evidence of an imminent financial crisis in the supplied context.

### Tail risks (why not 100%)
- A sudden systemic event (financial accident, geopolitical shock, severe data discontinuity) could trigger an **inter-meeting cut**.  
- An inter-meeting **hike** is even less likely but not impossible under an extreme inflation/expectations shock.

Given those tails look comfortably **<10%**, the **10th–90th percentiles** should all sit very near **3.75%**.

## Quick forecast checklist (abridged)
1) **Target variable:** Upper bound of fed funds target range on **Feb 28, 2026** (percent).  
2) **Outside view base rate:** Between-meeting periods → overwhelming probability of **no change**.  
3) **Consistency:** Implied median ≈ **3.7505**; mean ≈ **3.7505**; consistent with “almost surely unchanged.”  
4) **Key evidence:** (i) No scheduled meeting before Feb 28, (ii) Jan 28 range = 3.50–3.75, (iii) Jefferson: higher bar for cuts / near neutral, (iv) macro not crisis-like.  
5) **Blind spot:** Sudden shock forcing an **emergency cut** (would push outcome **down**).
