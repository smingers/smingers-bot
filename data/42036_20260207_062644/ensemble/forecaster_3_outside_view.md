Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (quality, date, fact vs opinion)
- **Federal Reserve “Fed explained” (undated educational page; accessed as provided)**  
  - **What it says (facts):** Describes *mechanics* of easing via target range and administered rates (IORB/ON RRP).  
  - **Usefulness:** Background only; **no forward-looking rate information**.

- **FederalReserveHistory essay (Wheelock; written as of July 2022)**  
  - **What it says (facts):** Historical evolution of the fed funds rate as an operating target; post-2008 ample reserves framework; IORB central to implementation.  
  - **Usefulness:** Good context; **no current-cycle forecast content**.

- **Bankrate (Jan 28, 2026)**  
  - **Facts:** Current target range **3.50–3.75%**; peak **5.25–5.50%**; cumulative cuts **1.75 pp** from peak; January 2026 meeting held steady.  
  - **Opinions:** Narrative about balancing inflation vs labor market momentum.  
  - **Quality:** Secondary journalism; the *current range level* is the key factual input and is consistent with other sources.

- **USA TODAY live story (Jan 28, 2026)**  
  - **Facts:** Fed held steady at Jan meeting; reports CME FedWatch end-2026 modal range around **3.00–3.25%**.  
  - **Opinions:** “Most forecasters believe…” and similar summary statements.  
  - **Quality:** Generally fine as a snapshot of consensus; not as clean as direct market data.

- **Business Insider (Jan 28, 2026)**  
  - **Facts:** Fed held steady; next scheduled meeting **Mar 17–18, 2026**; statement wording change noted.  
  - **Opinions (attributed):** Goldman/others suggesting “normalization” cuts.  
  - **Quality:** Useful for meeting schedule + qualitative tone; still journalism.

- **CBS News (Jan 27, 2026)**  
  - **Facts:** Current range **3.50–3.75%**; expectation of hold (FactSet poll); mentions three consecutive cuts in late 2025.  
  - **Opinions (attributed):** Quotes from Bankrate/LendingTree/RSM etc.  
  - **Quality:** Good for confirming status quo and that “hold” was consensus going into January.

- **Agent report (reconstructed FedWatch probabilities as of Feb 7, 2026; based on Investing.com snapshots Feb 2 & Feb 5)**  
  - **Facts (if reconstruction is accurate):** Market-implied probabilities for **March 18**: ~**82% hold** at **3.50–3.75**, ~**18%** for a 25 bp cut to **3.25–3.50**; later meetings show gradual easing.  
  - **Quality/limitations:** Indirect (Investing.com snapshots rather than CME’s own page) but **corroborated by two snapshots** and a quiet Feb 6 session. This is the *most decision-relevant* “near-term” quantitative evidence provided.

**Bottom line from sources:** As of Feb 7, 2026 the effective *status quo* upper bound is **3.75%**, the next scheduled opportunity to change it is **mid-March**, and markets strongly expect no change at that March meeting—implying very low perceived odds of an intermeeting surprise before Feb 28.

### (b) Reference class analysis
Possible reference classes for “upper bound on a date ~3 weeks ahead with no scheduled FOMC meeting before that date”:

1. **Intermeeting target changes in the modern era (roughly 1994–2026)**  
   - Pros: Directly relevant because Feb 28 is *between* scheduled meetings.  
   - Cons: Intermeeting moves cluster in crises (2001, 2008, 2020), so a simple average can overstate risk in normal times.

2. **All 3–4 week windows during easing cycles when the Fed is cutting gradually**  
   - Pros: Captures current regime (post-peak cuts; “meeting-by-meeting”).  
   - Cons: Still, changes almost always occur *at meetings*.

**Most suitable:** (1) Intermeeting change frequency, *conditioned* on “no obvious acute crisis signal.” This maps cleanly onto whether the upper bound changes at all by Feb 28.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Today:** Feb 7, 2026  
- **Outcome date:** Feb 28, 2026  
- **Horizon:** **21 days**.
- **Meeting calendar:** Next scheduled FOMC meeting is **Mar 17–18, 2026**, so **no scheduled meeting** before resolution.

Historically, absent crisis conditions, the Fed almost never changes the target range between meetings. Intermeeting moves have occurred, but they are rare and typically associated with major shocks (financial crisis, pandemic, acute market dysfunction).

---

### (d) Justification (outside view)
**Status quo / default path:** Upper bound remains **3.75%** through Feb 28 because there is no scheduled meeting.

**What would cause a lower outcome (cut before Feb 28)?**
- Sudden sharp deterioration in financial conditions (liquidity/credit event), or
- Abrupt collapse in labor-market or inflation data *plus* strong signaling from Fed officials (though blackout limits that), or
- Exogenous shock prompting an emergency FOMC action.

Given: (i) January decision to hold, (ii) blackout limits new communication, and (iii) market-implied odds heavily weight “no change” even *by March*, the outside-view likelihood of an intermeeting cut in the next 21 days looks **very small**.

**What would cause a higher outcome (hike before Feb 28)?**
- A sudden inflation re-acceleration scare or severe credibility shock.  
This seems even less likely than an emergency cut given the cycle has already moved down from peak and the near-term market pricing does not point that way.

**Therefore:** The distribution should be extremely concentrated at **3.75%**, with small tail risk to **3.50%** (emergency -25 bp) and a very small tail to **4.00%** (emergency +25 bp).

Outside view calibration:

- **Tether to an established distribution:** The agent-reconstructed FedWatch shows **~82%** probability of *no change even by Mar 18* (i.e., after an actual meeting). If markets think March has only ~18% chance of a cut, then the chance of a cut **before** Feb 28 (without a meeting) should be **materially lower**—i.e., mostly confined to “emergency” scenarios.
- **Upset rate / unknown unknowns:** Intermeeting actions happen, but are rare and clustered; I’m pricing a **low single-digit percent** chance of any intermeeting move over a 3-week horizon, with cuts much more likely than hikes.
- **Resulting shape:** A near-point-mass at **3.75**. (Note: because the true outcome is effectively discrete in 25 bp steps, many percentiles would mathematically coincide at 3.75; I use tiny “epsilon” spacing below purely to satisfy the “strictly increasing percentile values” formatting rule.)

Outside View Prediction (upper bound, %):
Percentile 10: 3.749  
Percentile 20: 3.750  
Percentile 40: 3.7505  
Percentile 60: 3.751  
Percentile 80: 3.7515  
Percentile 90: 3.752
