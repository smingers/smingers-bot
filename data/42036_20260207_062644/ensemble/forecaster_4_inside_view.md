Forecast target (paraphrased in 17 words)  
“Upper bound of the Fed funds target range, expressed in percent, in force on 28 February 2026.”

==================================================
(a) Source analysis  (focus on the best-quality, decision-relevant items)

1. FOMC Policy Statement 28 Jan 2026 (CNBC, China Daily, Fed minutes excerpts).  
   – Fact: target range held at 3.50–3.75 %. Vote 10-2. Next scheduled meeting 17-18 Mar.  
   – Quality: Primary-source document, contemporaneous, high reliability. (Facts > opinions).

2. CME FedWatch probabilities (as reported 2 & 5 Feb 2026).  
   – Fact: Market prices assign ≈82-86 % chance of “no change” at the March meeting; ≈18 % chance of a 25 bp cut; ≈0 % of a hike.  
   – Quality: Derived from liquid Fed-funds futures; very reliable forward-looking measure.

3. Vice-Chair Jefferson speech 6 Feb 2026 (Yahoo Finance).  
   – Fact: Says current stance “broadly neutral”, “higher bar for cuts”, no hint of urgency.  
   – Quality: Senior policymaker; statements factual about his view but still opinion.

4. Effective funds rate data 30 Jan–5 Feb 2026 (Fed H.15).  
   – Fact: EFFR flat at 3.64 %, squarely within the 3.50–3.75 % band.  
   – Quality: Official data, confirms operations are normal.

5. BlackRock 2026 outlook (Dec 2025).  
   – Opinion: Expects pause, maybe two cuts later in 2026 after new chair.  
   – Quality: Large asset-manager, but dated (before Jan meeting); moderate weight.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong evidence  
• Institutional calendar: no FOMC meeting before 28 Feb (structural, hard to change).  
• Modern-era history: inter-meeting target moves are exceedingly rare outside acute crises (7 instances in 30 years).  
• Current market pricing: <1 in 10 chance of any move even by the *next* meeting.

Moderate evidence  
• Jefferson & Daly speeches: tone cautious but not alarmist → lowers odds of emergency move a bit more.  
• Macro data: GDP solid, unemployment 4.4 %, CPI ~2.7-3 % → no obvious crisis trigger.

Weak evidence  
• Media speculation (Investing.com, BlackRock) about “cuts later in 2026”.  
• Political noise around Powell succession.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon to resolution: 21 days.  
If horizon were halved (10 days): emergency-move probability shrinks further; distribution even tighter.  
If doubled (42 days, covering the March meeting): tail to 3.50 % would rise markedly (~20-25 %).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base-rate: With no scheduled meeting, precedent gives ~2 % chance of any inter-meeting change over three weeks.  
Inside-view factors (solid macro data, neutral Fed rhetoric, calm markets) do not resemble past emergency-cut episodes (9-11, GFC, Covid).  
Markets corroborate (≈0 % hike, low-single-digit cut probability pre-Feb 28).  
Hence keep base rate small; allocate 5 % to a surprise 25 bp cut (upper bound 3.50 %), 1 % to a surprise 25 bp hike (upper bound 4.00 %); 94 % probability status quo 3.75 %.

==================================================
Quick forecasting checklist  
1. Resolution variable aligned?  Yes – upper bound %, 28 Feb 2026.  
2. Outside-view base: 98 % “no change”. Retained ~94 % after inside-view cross-check.  
3. Consistency check: implied mean 3.75 × 0.94 + 3.50 × 0.05 + 4.00 × 0.01 = 3.742 %.  Makes sense.  
4. Key evidence: (i) No meeting before 28 Feb, (ii) Jan hold at 3.75 %, (iii) FedWatch < 1 % for inter-meeting move, (iv) calm macro, (v) Fed officials signal patience.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden systemic shock (large bank failure) forcing an emergency cut—would push outcome down to 3.50 % or lower.
