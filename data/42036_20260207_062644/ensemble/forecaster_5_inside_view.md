-------------------- ANALYSIS --------------------

1. Target variable (≤ 20 words)  
Upper bound (%) of the FOMC’s federal-funds target range that is in force on 28 February 2026, per Fed Implementation Note.

2. Outside-view base rate  
• 1994-2025: 9 unscheduled (“inter-meeting”) changes ≈ 0.3 per year ⇒ ≈ 1 % chance in any random 21-day window.  
• Therefore the modal outcome is “no change”.

3. Consistency check  
Implied median ≈ 3.75 %; mean ≈ 3.74 %.  Matches logic that the range almost certainly stays where it is now.

4. Key pieces of evidence (≤ 20 words each)  
a) 28 Jan 2026 FOMC held at 3.50–3.75 % (upper = 3.75 %).  
b) Next regular meeting is mid-March, i.e., after the 28 Feb resolution date.  
c) CME FedWatch: ≈ 82 % probability of “no move” at March meeting; ≤ 18 % for a 25-bp cut.  
d) Inter-meeting actions since 1994 occur only in acute crises; none apparent now.  
e) Fed officials (Jefferson, Daly) say policy “broadly neutral,” “higher bar for cuts”.

5. Blind-spot scenario  
Systemic shock (e.g., major bank failure) before 28 Feb forces an emergency 50-bp cut – pushes outcome down to 3.25 %.

--------------------------------------------------  

(a) Source analysis  
• FOMC Statement & Implementation Note (Jan 28 2026) – primary document; factual, highest quality.  
• CNBC, CBS, China Daily, etc. (Jan 27-29 2026) – mainstream media; agree on 3.50-3.75 % range.  
• Fox Business piece quoting 4.25-4.50 % clearly a reporting error (cross-checked with Fed source).  
• CME FedWatch screen-shots (Feb 6-7 2026) – market-implied probabilities; reliable, timely.  
• Y-Charts/Fed H.15 – shows effective rate 3.64 %, confirming current stance; factual.  
• Yahoo Finance (Jefferson speech, Feb 6 2026) – direct quotes from Vice-Chair; moderate evidence.  
All other AskNews items are about foreign central banks or unrelated markets → low/no relevance.

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong: Official FOMC release; schedule of next meeting; historic rarity of inter-meeting moves.  
Moderate: Market pricing via CME, Jefferson remarks, stability of economic data (payrolls, CPI).  
Weak: Opinion columns predicting eventual 2026 cuts; political noise around Fed leadership.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Time to resolution: 21 days.  Halving it (10 days) would cut already-tiny inter-meeting probability roughly in half again; doubling it (42 days) would raise tail risk modestly and slide the 20th percentile a bit lower (≈ 3.60 → 3.55).

(d) Justification – impact vs. base rate  
• Status-quo (3.75 %) gets 89 % weight – aligns with base rate + calming macro backdrop + market odds.  
• Single 25-bp emergency cut (upper = 3.50 %) gets 9 % – covers ordinary recession scare or political shock.  
• 50-bp cut (3.25 %) and 25-bp hike (4.00 %) share the remaining 2 % – capture extreme downside/upside tails.  
Smoothed around the Fed’s 25-bp grid to create strictly increasing percentiles yields the six numbers above.

The distribution is intentionally wide enough (90/10 span ≈ 0.46 percentage-points) to respect unknown-unknowns while keeping the mean anchored to overwhelmingly likely “no change” conditions.
