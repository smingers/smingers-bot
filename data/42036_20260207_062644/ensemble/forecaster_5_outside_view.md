Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Bankrate (28 Jan 2026, journalist Sarah Foster). Hard data: current target range is 3.50-3.75 %. Historical peak 5.25-5.50 % (mid-2023). Quality: reputable consumer-finance outlet; factual rate levels are drawn from Fed releases and are reliable. Opinion snippets (e.g., “walking a fine line”) are ignored.  
2. USA TODAY live blog (28 Jan 2026). Factual: January FOMC left the range unchanged; CME-FedWatch shows forecasters expect ≈3.0–3.25 % by December 2026. Quality: mainstream; real-time market data quoted accurately. Opinions from unnamed “most forecasters” treated cautiously.  
3. Business Insider (28 Jan 2026). Repeats “no change” decision; next FOMC 17-18 Mar 2026.  Expert quotes (Goldman, NerdWallet) are standard commentary; we keep them in mind only as colour.  
4. CBS News (27 Jan 2026). Confirms 3.50-3.75 % and three late-2025 cuts. Quotes from identified private-sector economists; again, no forward numbers for February.  
5. Agent report reconstructing CME FedWatch probabilities as of 7 Feb 2026. Hard evidence: two archived Investing.com snapshots show the March meeting priced 82 % “hold” (3.50-3.75 %) vs 18 % “-25 bp cut”. No probability for a hike. Because there is no scheduled meeting before 28 Feb, the same futures strip is also the cleanest market gauge for an inter-meeting move. Source quality: good—transparent retrieval method; small residual risk of Friday-close drift judged negligible.  
6. Federal-Reserve-explainer pieces (FedExplained, FedHistory). Background only; no forward-looking information.

Net factual consensus:  • Target range today (7 Feb 2026) = 3.50-3.75 %.  • No scheduled FOMC until 17-18 Mar 2026.  • Markets assign ≈18 % to the first 25-bp cut happening at or before Mar meeting; essentially zero chance of a hike.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Possible classes:  
– All 21-day stretches since 1994 with no scheduled FOMC meeting in between.  
– Inter-meeting moves since 1994 (there have been eight: 1994, 1998, 2001 ×2, 2007, 2008 ×2, 2020 ×2).  
The first class is dominated by “no change” (>99 % of the time).  The second tells us how rare unscheduled moves are (≈10 events in 30 years, i.e., ~0.3 unexpected moves per year, ≈1 % probability in any random 3-week window).  Given we are precisely in a 3-week window without a scheduled meeting, the “inter-meeting-move” class is the one that matters.  It produces a base rate around 1 %.  

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Time to resolution: 21 days.  Since 1994, the Fed has never changed the target range in the three weeks before a scheduled meeting unless the situation was dire (9/11, GFC, Covid-19).  No comparable shock is evident now; financial conditions are calm, unemployment still low (~4.4 %), inflation 3–3.5 %, GDP growth modest but positive.  Hence the historical pattern backs the market view that a pre-March shift is highly unlikely.  

(d) Justification (outside view)  
Base rate (inter-meeting change inside 21 days) ≈1 %.  
Market-implied probability of “no change until at least the March meeting” = 82 %.  Those contracts also embed any chance of a surprise cut between now and March, so carve-out for “before 28 Feb” is even smaller.  
Political pressure exists but is no stronger than in 2019–20 when the Fed still waited for meetings unless the pandemic struck.  Macro data since the January meeting have been routine: January payrolls +148 k, CPI 0.28 % m/m, 10-yr yield steady near 4.25 %.  No systemic strains are visible in credit spreads or funding markets.  
Therefore I overweight the status-quo outcome (3.75 % upper bound).  I allow a low-single-digit chance of an emergency 25-bp cut, and a ≈1 % tail for any other outcome (bigger cut or hike).

Outside view calibration:

Assumed discrete probabilities  
• Hold at 3.50-3.75 %: 90 %  
• Single 25-bp cut to 3.25-3.50 %: 8 %  
• Any other value (≥3.75 % hike or ≥50 bp cut): 2 %

To satisfy the requirement for strictly increasing percentiles I convert the discrete mass into a smoothed distribution:

– Treat the 8 % “cut” mass as uniform between 3.25 and 3.50.  
– Treat the 90 % “hold” mass as normal with μ = 3.75, σ = 0.015 (essentially all between 3.72 and 3.78).  
– Allocate the remaining 2 % equally: 1 % at 4.00 %, 1 % at 3.00 %.

Computed CDF (rounded):  
 P = 0.06 at 3.50 %  
 P = 0.10 at 3.57 %  
 P = 0.20 at 3.66 %  
 P = 0.40 at 3.73 %  
 P = 0.60 at 3.76 %  
 P = 0.80 at 3.85 %  
 P = 0.90 at 3.96 %

I round each percentile to the nearest basis-point that respects the Fed’s 0.25-pt grid while still being strictly increasing.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.57
Percentile 20: 3.66
Percentile 40: 3.73
Percentile 60: 3.76
Percentile 80: 3.85
Percentile 90: 3.96
