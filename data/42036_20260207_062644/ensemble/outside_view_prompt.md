You are currently analyzing a numeric forecasting question to generate a final, inside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
What will be the upper bound of the Federal Funds Target Range on February 28, 2026?

Question background:
The Federal Funds Target Range is the primary tool used by the Federal Reserve to influence economic conditions in the United States. This question tracks the upper bound of that range as of Feb 28, 2026.

`{"format":"bot_tournament_question","info":{"hash_id":"01174c2854746b5a","sheet_id":65.3}}`

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves to the value of the upper bound of the target range for the federal funds rate as set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), effective on February 28, 2026. The primary source for resolution is the Federal Reserve Board's official 'Implementation Note' or 'Policy Statement' issued following the most recent FOMC meeting prior to or on February 28, 2026. If the Federal Reserve specifies a single target rate rather than a range, that single rate will serve as the resolution value. Resolves based on data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) series 'DFEDTARU' (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFEDTARU)

## Summary of Article

**Disclaimer**: The extracted content appears to be incomplete and primarily consists of a flowchart or diagram description rather than a full article with substantive information.

### Key Content:

**Topic**: The article describes the Federal Open Market Committee's (FOMC) mechanism for implementing accommodative monetary policy (easing).

**Process Description**:
The content outlines the transmission mechanism when the FOMC decides to ease policy:

1. **FOMC Action**: Sets a target range for the federal funds rate and decides to make policy more accommodative
2. **Fed Instructions**: 
   - Instructs the Open Market Desk to reduce the overnight reverse repurchase agreement (ON RRP) offering rate
   - Reduces the interest on reserve balances (IORB) rate
3. **Market Participant Response**:
   - Desk counterparties compare market rates with the Fed's offering rate to decide where to invest cash
   - Banks compare market rates with the Fed's IORB rate to decide where to invest cash
4. **Market Effect**: The comparison of the Fed's administered rates with market rates encourages market rates to move down
5. **Economic Impact**: Lower rates in the economy lead to increased borrowing opportunities for households and businesses, which influences employment, inflation, and output

**Note**: This appears to be an educational/explanatory graphic or diagram from the Federal Reserve website describing monetary policy transmission mechanisms. It does not contain specific forecasts, statistics, dates, or opinions relevant to predicting the federal funds rate target range on February 28, 2026.

## Summary of Article: "Federal Funds Rate"

**Source:** Federalreservehistory  
**Author:** David C. Wheelock  
**Date:** Written as of July 2022

### Key Facts and Historical Information:

**Historical Development:**
- The Federal Reserve began operations in November 1914 and developed a telegraphic network enabling overnight lending of "federal funds" (funds on deposit at Federal Reserve Banks)
- First federal funds loans occurred between New York City banks in summer 1921
- Federal funds trading volume grew from rarely exceeding $20 million daily in 1921 to $40-80 million by 1925, and after 1925 ranged upward from $100 million, reaching $250 million at times
- By 1925, banks outside New York City were lending federal funds locally; lending between banks in different Fed Districts was common by end of 1920s

**Evolution as Policy Tool:**
- During the 1920s, the Fed was learning to use policy tools but did not specifically target the federal funds rate, though the rate reflected the impact of Fed actions on the money market
- During the Great Depression and WWII, federal funds trading was thin with rates usually close to zero
- Trading revived after WWII and rose over time
- By the 1960s, the Fed actively monitored the federal funds rate to gauge money market conditions
- By the 1970s, the FOMC was setting explicit targets for the federal funds rate as part of monetary policy conduct

**Current Framework (as of July 2022):**
- The FOMC conducts monetary policy by setting a target range for the federal funds rate
- Following the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession, the Fed made large-scale asset purchases that greatly increased reserves in the banking system
- Since then, reserves have remained ample, and **the interest rate paid on reserve balances (rather than open-market operations) is now the Fed's main tool for implementing monetary policy**
- The Fed adjusts the interest rate on reserve balances up or down to ensure the federal funds rate stays within the FOMC's target range

### Relevance to Forecasting Question:
This article provides historical context on how the federal funds rate operates and how the Fed implements its target range, but contains no forward-looking projections or data relevant to forecasting the upper bound on February 28, 2026.

# Summary of Article: "Federal Funds Rate History: 1980 Through The Present"

**Source:** Bankrate  
**Date:** January 28, 2026  
**Author:** Sarah Foster

## Key Facts and Statistics:

### Current Federal Funds Rate (as of January 2026):
- **The federal funds rate is currently in a target range of 3.5-3.75%** (as of January 2026 meeting)
- The Fed did not lower interest rates at their January 2026 meeting
- Policymakers have reduced borrowing costs by **1.75 percentage points** since the peak
- The peak rate was **5.25-5.5%**, reached more than two years ago (approximately mid-2023)

### Historical Context Provided:
- Before the Great Recession, the effective federal funds rate averaged **6.38%**
- **1980s:** Fed funds rate reached its highest ever at **19-20%** (December 5, 1980) to combat inflation of 14.6%
- The effective fed funds rate averaged **9.97%** during the 1980s decade
- Interest rates haven't exceeded 10% since November 1984
- **1990s:** Rates peaked at **6.5%** (May 2000) and reached a low of **3%** (September 1992)
- **2000s:** Rates were cut to **1%** after the dot-com bust and 9/11, then hiked to **5.25%** between 2004-2006, before being slashed to near-zero during the 2008 financial crisis
- **2010s:** Rates remained at rock-bottom until 2015, with gradual increases thereafter

### Article Context:
The article describes the current cycle as the Fed "walking a fine line: balancing stubborn inflation against a labor market that's beginning to lose momentum." Current consumer borrowing costs remain higher than at any point in the decade leading up to the pandemic.

**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off at the end, so the complete historical account through the 2010s may be incomplete in the extracted content.

Query: CME FedWatch February 7 2026 probabilities for Fed funds
Objective  
Reconstruct, as precisely as publicly available evidence allows, the CME Group FedWatch Tool’s implied probabilities for the federal-funds target range as of Saturday 7 February 2026 (i.e., after the U.S. market close on Friday 6 February).

1. What hard evidence exists for that week?  
• Investing.com’s Fed Rate Monitor tool – which scrapes the same 30-Day Fed-Funds-futures strip that powers CME FedWatch – was captured by the Wayback Machine for Thursday 5 February 2026.  The snapshot is still live on the Nigerian sub-domain and shows full probability tables for the six scheduled FOMC meetings then listed on CME FedWatch (Mar 18, Apr 29, Jun 17, Jul 29, Sep 23, Nov 11 2026).  For the next (March) meeting it reports:  
 – 3.25–3.50 % range (-25 bp cut): 17.7 %  
 – 3.50–3.75 % range (no change): 82.3 %  
 All other outcomes: 0 %  
 (Investing.com Nigeria, 05 Feb 2026).  

• The same 17.7 %/82.3 % split is found in a French-language Investing.com snapshot dated Monday 2 February 2026, corroborating that the 5 Feb data are not a one-off (Investing.com France, 02 Feb 2026).  

• A FinancialContent wire story of 2 Feb quotes a “48 % chance of a cut in March”.  Because no other source repeats that figure, and because two independent Investing.com captures agree on 17.7 %, the 48 % number is likely a mis-statement or refers to a later meeting month.  

• No image, PDF or HTML capture of CME’s own FedWatch page for 6 or 7 Feb could be located; CME’s JavaScript delivery defeats most web crawlers.  Likewise, Bloomberg’s WIRP <GO> and Refinitiv’s probability screens sit behind paywalls and do not surface in open-web search.

2. Did anything happen on Friday 6 February that would have moved the strip?  
Friday brought no tier-one U.S. data releases, no Fed speeches (the FOMC was in its pre-meeting blackout), and only routine Treasury financing announcements.  A scan of major financial-press headlines for 6 Feb finds no rate-sensitive surprises.  The U.S. 2-yr note yield finished the day at 3.46 %, barely 2 bp lower than on 5 Feb (Investing.com end-of-day data), confirming a quiet rate session.

Because 7 February 2026 was a Saturday, CME Fed-Funds futures did not trade; the last observable probabilities are the Friday close.  Given:  
(a) the near-identical Investing.com readings on 2 Feb and 5 Feb, and  
(b) the absence of market-moving news on 6 Feb,  

the best-supported inference is that the 5 Feb probabilities also held through the 6 Feb close and therefore describe the market as of 7 Feb.

3. Reconstructed FedWatch probabilities for 7 February 2026  

FOMC meeting 18 March 2026  
• Target 3.25–3.50 % (-25 bp): ≈ 18 %  
• Target 3.50–3.75 % (unchanged): ≈ 82 %  
• Any other outcome:      ≈ 0 %  
(based directly on Investing.com Nigeria snapshot, 05 Feb 2026).

For later-dated meetings CME FedWatch in early February 2026 still showed only two or three adjacent 25-bp “buckets”.  The 5 Feb Investing.com table provides those exact numbers:

 Apr 29 2026  
 • Cut to 3.00–3.25 %: 3.4 %  
 • Cut to 3.25–3.50 %: 30.2 %  
 • Hold at 3.50–3.75 %: 66.4 %

 Jun 17 2026  
 • 2.75–3.00 %: 1.9 %  
 • 3.00–3.25 %: 18.5 %  
 • 3.25–3.50 %: 50.6 %  
 • 3.50–3.75 %: 29.0 %

 Jul 29 2026  
 • 2.50–2.75 %: 0.7 %  
 • 2.75–3.00 %: 8.2 %  
 • 3.00–3.25 %: 30.6 %  
 • 3.25–3.50 %: 42.5 %  
 • 3.50–3.75 %: 18.1 %

 Sep 23 2026  
 • 2.25–2.50 %: 0.3 %  
 • 2.50–2.75 %: 4.1 %  
 • 2.75–3.00 %: 18.3 %  
 • 3.00–3.25 %: 35.9 %  
 • 3.25–3.50 %: 31.5 %  
 • 3.50–3.75 %: 9.9 %

 Nov 11 2026  
 • 2.00–2.25 %: 0.1 %  
 • 2.25–2.50 %: 1.2 %  
 • 2.50–2.75 %: 7.3 %  
 • 2.75–3.00 %: 22.3 %  
 • 3.00–3.25 %: 34.9 %  
 • 3.25–3.50 %: 26.5 %  
 • 3.50–3.75 %: 7.7 %  
(all from Investing.com Nigeria, 05 Feb 2026).

Those numbers almost certainly remained within a rounding error on 6 Feb, as no Fed-funds futures contracts for those expiries posted meaningful price changes that day (checked via CME settlement tables).

4. Remaining information gaps  
• A time-stamped CME FedWatch PDF or screen-grab for 7 Feb 2026 would remove the small residual uncertainty tied to the quiet 6 Feb trading session.  
• Bloomberg WIRP or Refinitiv Eikon historical exports could provide tick-by-tick validation, but are subscription-only.  
• The outlier “48 %” probability quoted by FinancialContent on 2 Feb 2026 is still unexplained and could merit a search of that outlet’s correction log.

5. How much confidence can investors place in the reconstruction?  
High.  Two independent Investing.com snapshots bracketing the week (2 Feb and 5 Feb) agree to the tenth of a percentage point.  Market conditions on 6 Feb were docile, and 7 Feb was a non-trading day.  For the March FOMC meeting, therefore, an 82 %/18 % “hold vs. one-cut” split is almost certainly the same figure CME FedWatch would have displayed on 7 February 2026.

The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
