Analysis:
The question will resolve to whatever upper‐bound value the FOMC most recently announced before (or on) 28 Feb 2026.  
Therefore the key pieces of information to locate are:

• The Implementation Note / Policy Statement released after the late-January 2026 FOMC meeting (the last regularly-scheduled meeting before 28 Feb 2026).  
• Any unscheduled (inter-meeting) FOMC decisions between that meeting and 28 Feb 2026.  
• Confirmation of the corresponding value in the St. Louis Fed’s DFEDTARU series.

Current press coverage, Fed releases and market commentary dated February 2026 will provide that information.  I will focus my searches on (a) the official Fed site and (b) major financial news outlets reporting on the January 27-28 2026 decision and any subsequent surprise moves.
