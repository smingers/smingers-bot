This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves to the value of the upper bound of the target range for the federal funds rate as set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), effective on February 28, 2026. The primary source for resolution is the Federal Reserve Board's official 'Implementation Note' or 'Policy Statement' issued following the most recent FOMC meeting prior to or on February 28, 2026. If the Federal Reserve specifies a single target rate rather than a range, that single rate will serve as the resolution value. Resolves based on data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) series 'DFEDTARU' (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFEDTARU)

Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-07 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

The lower bound is 0.0 and the upper bound is 7.0.
Both bounds are OPEN: outcomes can fall below the lower bound or above the upper bound. Your percentile estimates may extend beyond this range if well-supported by evidence.

For google/google news:
Your query for google and google news are processed by classical search engines, so please phrase the queries in a way optimal for keyword optimized search (i.e., the phrase you search is likely to appear on desired web pages). Avoid writing overly specific queries. Limit to six words.

For AskNews:
Your query for AskNews will be processed more naturally, so feel free to write a sentence-long query in natural language. Avoid using ambiguous acronyms. Specify relevant criteria (e.g., geography, industry, time period) to ensure the correct scope. If desired, you can indicate multiple kinds of news articles you're looking for in your query. Keep your query to a maximum of two sentences. Important note: Do not prefix your query with 'AskNews:' or something similar. Please add the word 'AskNews' enclosed in brackets at the end of the query, referring closely to the example below.

You should format your answer exactly as below, always formatting the source in brackets () (NOT curly brackets, NOT squared brackets [], you need to use normal brackets ()) **on the same line as and after** the query, applicable for Google, Google News and AskNews. Do not wrap your query in quotes. Be sure to include two queries for Google/Google News and one for AskNews.

Use the following verification checklist:
1. One query for google?
2. One query for google news?
3. One query for AskNews?
4. All queries followed by either (Google), (Google News) or (AskNews) in brackets () on the same line as the query?
