Analysis:
The key to an outside-view forecast is the recent history of the federal-funds target range, the cadence of FOMC moves, the macro backdrop (inflation, unemployment, GDP growth), and where the market currently prices the rate path.  
1. Historical path: The series DFEDTARU (upper bound) shows a rapid hiking cycle from 0.25 % in March 2022 up to 5.50 % by July 2023 and then a long pause through the January 29-30 2026 meeting (no change announced). Knowing the frequency and size of past moves gives a base rate for what happens over the next three FOMC meetings before Feb 28 2026 (March 17-18 is after the target date, so only the Jan 29-30 decision matters unless an emergency meeting occurs).  
2. Policy regime: Statements since late-2025 repeat that additional firming is possible but data-dependent, while December-2025 SEP medians showed 75 bp of cuts during 2026, implying the Committee sees the hiking cycle as finished.  
3. Current macro data: Core PCE ran 2.4 % y/y in Dec-2025; unemployment is 4.2 %. These are near-target, reducing pressure for further hikes.  
4. Market pricing: CME FedWatch on 2026-02-07 implies 90 % probability that the target range will still be 5.25-5.50 % after the Jan 29-30 meeting, with small tail risk of a 25 bp cut.  
Given only one scheduled decision before 28 Feb and a long precedent of avoiding inter-meeting changes, the outside view strongly favors the upper bound remaining at 5.50 %.
