The next key rate decision is scheduled for Friday, February 13, 2026, with expectations that the regulator may continue its gradual easing cycle by 1%. This decision is likely influenced by persistently high household inflation expectations and ongoing geopolitical tensions. The euro rose 1% against the US dollar in January, reaching 1.2080\u2014its highest level in 4.5 years\u2014driven by risks of another US government shutdown. Dollar pressure eased after the January 28 Federal Reserve meeting, where the Fed maintained the federal funds rate at 3.5\u20133.75%, and Chair Jerome Powell signaled no expectation of rate cuts in March. With 90% probability, the market now expects a pause in the rate-cutting cycle. Additional support for the dollar came from the ISM Manufacturing Index, which rose to 52.6 (above 50 indicates expansion), the highest since September 2022, signaling sustainable growth in the world\u2019s largest economy despite persistent inflation risks. In contrast, inflationary pressure in Europe is declining: the Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices (HICP, YoY) fell to 1.7% in January 2026 (down 0.2 percentage points), below the target of 2%. The European Central Bank held its rate steady at 2.15% on February 5, 2026, as expected, maintaining its current monetary policy stance.

The USD Index is rising toward the start of a potential downtrend in the 99.00\u201399.40 range, supported by positive U.S. labor market and business activity reports in early February. However, the index remains below the weekly high of 97.90, which is seen as a key reversal point that could trigger a short-term downward momentum. Competing currencies and assets, including gold, the Dow Jones, and EUR/USD, are approaching critical levels that may prompt favorable trading opportunities. U.S. economic fundamentals\u2014strong GDP growth, positive consumer sentiment, and inflation data\u2014have fostered a risk-friendly market environment. A pullback in gold, the euro, and the Dow Jones near their weekly lows is expected to create favorable conditions for a short-term USD sell-off from the 97.90 level. Additionally, speculation about former President Donald Trump\u2019s calls for a weaker dollar to boost the U.S. economy may drive liquidity out of the dollar, fueling gains in its competitors. The Dow Jones is maintaining a short-term uptrend near 48,400, with a key target range of 48,400\u201348,600. The Federal Reserve is considered likely to stimulate the economy through rate cuts and renewed bond-buying programs, which historically strengthen rival assets. This dynamic supports a bullish outlook for EUR/USD, with a potential reversal from the 1.1775\u20131.1790 range and a continuation of the medium-term uptrend starting from 1.1580.

Speaking at the Brookings Institution in Washington, D.C., Jefferson said the current policy stance is well-positioned to balance the Fed\u2019s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability. He noted that the labor market is 'roughly in balance,' with a low-hire, low-fire environment persisting, and projected the unemployment rate to remain steady at 4.4%. Jefferson raised his GDP growth forecast to 2.2% for 2026, aligning with 2025\u2019s growth rate. He cited a stall in inflation\u2019s decline due to tariffs, estimating core inflation (PCE index) ended 2025 at 3%, but expressed cautious optimism, expecting inflation to resume its decline once tariffs are fully absorbed and services prices continue to fall. He also highlighted that productivity growth could further reduce inflation. In contrast, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, in a LinkedIn post on the same day, expressed concerns about labor market fragility, noting a disconnect between business optimism and worker anxiety. She warned that the current low-hire, low-fire environment could shift rapidly to one with more layoffs, calling the situation 'precarious' given inflation remains above the Fed\u2019s 2% target.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 05:38 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

This marks the fourth Falcon 9 upper-stage incident in 19 months, including a July 11, 2024, liquid oxygen leak during a Starlink launch, a September 28, 2024, off-nominal deorbit burn during Crew-9\u2019s ISS mission, and a Feb. 1, 2025, deorbit failure that caused a fiery reentry on Feb. 19. The U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) mandated investigations after the July and September incidents, each taking approximately two weeks, with Falcon 9 returning to flight on July 25 and Oct. 11, respectively. Based on this precedent, a return-to-flight date of around Feb. 16, 2025, is projected\u2014five days after Crew-12\u2019s original target of Feb. 11, and five days later than the fast-tracked Feb. 15 date. The Crew-12 mission, scheduled to launch the ISS crew, was accelerated to avoid a prolonged three-person crew stint since Jan. 15. Despite the recent anomalies, Falcon 9 has flown over 240 missions in this period, with only four upper-stage issues and two first-stage landing failures\u2014both of which still delivered payloads successfully. SpaceX may reduce grounding time due to lessons learned, but the final timeline remains uncertain. The Feb. 1 anomaly did not trigger an FAA investigation, as all flight events were within licensed activities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 03:00 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/4-upper-stage-issues-19-150000589.html)\n\n**RBI marginally raises inflation projection on higher precious metals prices | Mint**\nThe Reserve Bank of India (RBI) marginally increased its inflation projection for the current fiscal year to 2.1% and revised upward the CPI-based inflation forecasts for the first and second quarters of 2026-27 to 4.0% and 4.2%, respectively. This revision was primarily driven by higher prices of precious metals, which contributed 60\u201370 basis points to the upward adjustment. Headline CPI inflation remained low at 0.7% in November 2025 and 1.3% in December 2025. Food group inflation continued in deflation, while fuel group inflation remained moderate. Core inflation (CPI excluding food and fuel) stayed stable at 2.6% in December 2025, excluding gold. RBI Governor Sanjay Malhotra stated that despite the upward revision, the outlook remains benign and near the inflation target. He cited strong kharif production, ample buffer stocks, favorable rabi sowing, and adequate reservoir levels as supporting food supply stability. Core inflation is expected to remain range-bound, barring volatility from precious metals. Geopolitical uncertainty, energy price volatility, and adverse weather events pose upside risks. The RBI will release the full-year 2026-27 CPI inflation projection in its April 2026 policy statement, following the upcoming release of the new CPI series (base 2024=100) on February 12, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 06:42 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/focus/rbi-marginally-raises-inflation-projection-on-higher-precious-metals-prices-11770360036940.html)\n\n**Polymarket Bitcoin Forecast for February Deteriorates Amid Market Fear and Outflows**\nBitcoin dipped below $72,000 during the Asian session on Thursday, its lowest level in nearly 16 months. As selling pressure intensifies, Polymarket trader sentiment has turned markedly bearish in the near term, despite long-term optimism. The February 2026 contract shows a 74% probability that Bitcoin will trade around $70,000 by expiration (a 65% increase from earlier), making it the most actively traded scenario. Expectations for higher prices have sharply declined: $85,000 (29%, down 61%), $90,000 (12%), and $95,000 (7%). Negative scenarios show increased likelihood: $65,000 (39%, down 13%), $60,000 (19%), and below $55,000 (9%). The expected February range is $65,000\u2013$85,000, with $70,000 seen as the most probable level. The 2026 annual contract remains bullish but cautious: 55% chance of reaching $100,000 (down 29%), 42% for $110,000 (down 29%), and $65,000 in 2026 now has an 83% probability (up 24%, with over $1M in volume). Upper targets are now weak: $130,000 (20%), $140,000 (15%), $250,000 (5%). Key bearish drivers include rising geopolitical tensions, the U.S. government shutdown\u2019s data gaps, a new Federal Reserve chair with a hawkish stance, and a heavy technical picture. Open interest dropped to a nine-month low, with over $5.4 billion in liquidations since late January. Spot Bitcoin ETFs saw net outflows: $817M (Jan 29), $509M (Jan 30), $272M (Feb 3), with only Feb 2 showing a $561M inflow. Total ETF assets fell from over $128B in mid-January to $97B. The Fear & Greed Index dropped to 12\u2014its lowest since November 2025\u2014indicating extreme fear. Gold surged above $5,000 per ounce, signaling a large capital shift to safe-haven assets. Polymarket data reflects a market focused on $70,000 as a near-term floor, with near-term upside expectations largely extinguished, though long-term optimism remains, albeit weakened.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 02:25 PM\nSource:[BeInCrypto - Russia](https://ru.beincrypto.com/polymarket-ceny-bitcoin-70k-fevral/)\n\n**Navigating Employment Resilience and the 'Final Mile' of Inflation**\nThe beginning of 2026 has introduced a cautious narrative across New York\u2019s financial markets, following a strong end to the previous year driven by optimism over interest rate cuts that pushed indices to historic highs. February 2026 is now seen as a 'reality check' for fund managers. The Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy for the first half of 2026 will be determined by two key data releases: the nonfarm payroll report and the Consumer Price Index (CPI). The February 6 payroll report is expected to show the unemployment rate rising to 4.5% from 4.4% in December, with analysts watching hourly wage growth\u2014above 4% year-over-year could signal persistent inflationary pressures despite a cooling labor market. A job creation figure below 100,000 could trigger recession concerns. The CPI report on February 11 is expected to show inflation at 2.7%, though the 'last mile' from 3% to the Fed\u2019s 2% target remains challenging. Persistent services inflation and geopolitical factors such as tariffs and supply chain shifts are complicating disinflation. A CPI result above 2.9% could trigger sharp market volatility, especially in tech and growth stocks. In response, the author emphasizes risk management over speculation, advocating for disciplined portfolio management based on fundamentals, technical levels, and preparedness for both a soft landing (unemployment at 4.5%, inflation at 2.7%) and a stalled inflation scenario. The message is clear: discipline and patience in February may yield rewards in spring.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 06:28 AM\nSource:[Investing.com Espa\u00f1ol](https://es.investing.com/analysis/navegando-entre-la-resiliencia-del-empleo-y-la-ultima-milla-de-la-inflacion-200480952)\n\n**Azerbaijani Central Bank decreases refinancing rate**\nThe Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) reduced the refinancing rate by 0.25 percentage points to 6.5% on February 4, 2026, as part of a broader adjustment to the interest rate corridor, lowering the lower limit to 5.5% and raising the upper limit to 7.5%. This decision followed a review of inflation trends, global economic conditions, and domestic macroeconomic developments. Annual inflation in December 2025 stood at 5.2%, within the target range of 4\u00b12%, with a downward trend observed over the previous two months. Core inflation was 4.8% in December 2025, indicating inflationary pressures are close to target. External factors, including a $423 million net purchase of foreign currency by exchange offices in 2025 and a 2.6 percentage point decline in dollarization of resident deposits to 28%, contributed to exchange rate stability. CBA foreign exchange reserves rose by 5.1% in 2025 to $11.5 billion, supported by a positive foreign trade balance of $0.7 billion and a preliminary surplus of $6.9 billion excluding gold imports. The current account is projected to remain in surplus in 2026 and 2027 under the baseline scenario. Monetary policy actions, including one-week deposit auctions, have helped maintain interest rates within the corridor, with the AZIR index falling from 6.73% in December 2025 to 6.7% in January 2026. The cumulative 0.5 percentage point rate cut in July and December 2025 led to declines in government security yields and new deposit and loan rates. Inflation forecasts for 2026 and 2027 were revised downward to 5.5% and 4%, respectively. Risks remain elevated due to global geopolitical tensions, economic fragmentation, and commodity market volatility, particularly the transmission of import prices to domestic inflation. Domestic risks include unanticipated cost pressures. The next policy decision is scheduled for April 2, 2026, and the current decision takes effect on February 5, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 09:36 AM\nSource:[Trend News Agency](https://www.trend.az/business/4149375.html)\n\n**Inflation at critical juncture: First three months decisive**\nEconomist Mustafa A\u015fk\u0131n evaluated the latest inflation data released in Turkey, noting that the monthly inflation rate reached 4.8%, exceeding expectations and signaling significant ongoing risks.

This decision is part of a gradual easing cycle, as inflation remains within the target range of 4\u00b12%. The central bank adjusted the interest rate corridor, setting the lower limit at 5.5% and the upper limit at 7.5%, signaling its intent to maintain sufficient liquidity. The move reflects the central bank's assessment that inflationary pressures are diminishing, supported by a recent decline in inflation rates, core inflation nearing the target, stable foreign exchange conditions, and increasing foreign exchange reserves. Officials noted that inflation risks remain relatively unchanged, with external price transmission and domestic cost factors continuing as key concerns. The bank reiterated its commitment to a data-driven approach and stated it remains ready to adjust policy if actual or projected inflation diverges from its baseline forecast.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 07:08 AM\nSource:[InstaForex](https://www.instaforex.com/forex-news/2885747)\n\n**Central Bank of Azerbaijan Unexpectedly Lowers Key Interest Rate to 6.5%**\nThe Central Bank of Azerbaijan unexpectedly reduced its key interest rate to 6.5% from 6.75% during a meeting on February 4, 2026. The lower bound of the interest rate corridor was lowered to 5.5% from 5.75%, and the upper bound to 7.5% from 7.75%. The decision took effect on February 5, 2026. The central bank stated that the move was based on inflation forecasts, which remained within the target range of 4% \u00b1 2 percentage points, as well as global economic activity, conditions on international financial markets, domestic macroeconomic trends, and the transmission of monetary policy to financial markets and the real economy. Analysts from ING Group had previously expected the rate to remain unchanged. In 2025, the central bank held 8 rate-setting meetings, maintaining the rate on 6 occasions and reducing it by 25 basis points twice, including a reduction from 7% to 6.75% in December 2025.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 06:22 AM\nSource:[Interfax.ru](https://www.interfax.ru/business/1070964)\n\n**February Mortgage Outlook: At Least Mortgage Rates Are Calm - NerdWallet**\nMortgage interest rates are expected to remain stable in February 2026 due to a resilient U.S. economy and the Federal Reserve\u2019s decision to pause rate cuts. The Fed maintained the federal funds rate at its Jan. 27\u201328 meeting, removing language about rising employment risks\u2014a sign of confidence in the labor market despite inflation still above the 2% target. Average 30-year mortgage rates have hovered just over 6% for several months. The Fed\u2019s wait-and-see stance supports the expectation of flat rates. However, political developments may introduce volatility: President Trump nominated Kevin Warsh, a former Fed governor and critic of the Fed\u2019s rate-cutting hesitancy, to lead the central bank. Warsh\u2019s confirmation faces opposition, particularly from Sen. Thom Tillis (R-N.C.), who opposes any nominee until the ongoing criminal investigation into current Fed Chair Jerome Powell is resolved. The nomination cannot take effect until May, but market uncertainty around the process could ripple into mortgage rates. Freddie Mac\u2019s January survey reported an average rate of 6.1%, consistent with forecasts. Fannie Mae and the Mortgage Bankers Association both revised their outlooks to flat rates through 2026. While rates dipped significantly on Jan. 8 after Trump\u2019s announcement of a $200 billion mortgage-backed securities purchase\u2014driving rates to their lowest in over three years\u2014this was a one-time event. Overall, experts predict little movement in February, with rates likely to stay within the current narrow range.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 05:43 PM\nSource:[NerdWallet](https://www.nerdwallet.com/mortgages/news/mortgage-outlook-february-2026)\n\n**Copom Minutes Confirm Signal for Potential Interest Rate Cuts in March**\nThe Central Bank's Copom minutes confirmed a signal that a rate-cutting cycle may begin in March, though no decision has been made on the magnitude or duration of the cuts. The Selic rate was held at 15% for the fifth consecutive meeting. The Central Bank stated that the decision to signal a potential easing was based on a broad set of data, including recent inflation trends and clearer transmission of monetary policy, despite lags in its effects. While the Bank signaled a future relaxation of monetary policy, it emphasized that a restrictive stance will continue until inflation is securely converging to its target. Market expectations anticipate the first cut in March, reducing the Selic to 14.5% annually, with projections of 12.25% by the end of 2026. The inflation target is set at 3%, with a tolerance range of 1.5% to 4.5%, established under the continuous target regime since early 2025. Despite inflation remaining above the upper tolerance limit for six consecutive months until June of the previous year, the Bank has maintained its focus on future projections rather than recent price changes, given the six- to 18-month lag in monetary policy effects. The Copom's horizon now extends to the third quarter of 2027. Current market forecasts project inflation at 3.99% in 2026, 3.80% in 2027, and 3.5% in 2028 and 2029\u2014above the 3% central target. The Central Bank reiterated that rates will remain high until both inflation deceleration and anchoring of market expectations are consolidated, citing persistent price pressures, particularly linked to labor market dynamics. The minutes state: 'The Committee assesses that the cautious conduct of monetary policy has contributed to disinflationary gains and reaffirms its firm commitment to the Central Bank's mandate of bringing inflation to target.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 12:03 PM\nSource:[Brasil 247](https://www.brasil247.com/economia/ata-do-copom-confirma-sinalizacao-sobre-corte-de-juros-em-marco)\n\n**ATFX: RBA Raises Rates by 25 Basis Points, AUD Surges Amid Policy Divergence**\nOn February 3, 2026, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) announced a 25 basis point interest rate hike, raising the benchmark rate from 3.6% to 3.85%, marking its first increase since November 2023 and the first central bank to raise rates in 2026. The RBA cited stronger-than-expected private demand, greater capacity constraints, and a slightly tight labor market as reasons for the hike. Despite global trends of rate cuts by the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank, Australia\u2019s inflation remains unstable with upward pressure, prompting expectations of additional hikes by 2026. In response, AUDUSD surged from 0.6964 to 0.7025 within 30 minutes\u2014a 61-basis-point gain\u2014driven by the divergence in monetary policy. The RBA\u2019s 3.85% rate now exceeds the Fed\u2019s 3.75% upper limit, enhancing capital inflow appeal. Unlike Japan, where\u52a0\u606f (rate hikes) have not reversed yen depreciation due to persistently low absolute rates (0.75%), Australia\u2019s relatively high rate strengthens its currency. Australia\u2019s economic independence from the U.S. and eurozone, due to strong trade ties with Asia and reduced exposure to U.S. policies like those under Trump, allows for policy divergence. Inflation data shows core CPI rising from 2.8% in June 2025 to 3.3% by December 2025, exceeding the 2\u20133% target range. AUDUSD formed a strong bullish candle, recovering from Friday\u2019s losses. The pair is near the medium-term resistance at 0.7093, with support from the lower trendline of a medium-term uptrend. The long-term trend remains bullish, with the upper channel breached since January 26, signaling accelerated momentum.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 10:54 AM\nSource:[\u548c\u8baf\u5916\u6c47](http://forex.hexun.com/2026-02-03/223378695.html)\n\n**PSX gains ground on easing geopolitical risks**\nThe Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX) closed higher on February 2, 2026, with the KSE-100 index gaining 883.35 points, or 0.48%, to settle at 185,057.83, driven by easing geopolitical tensions and selective buying. The index fluctuated between an intra-day high of 185,612 and a low of 182,792, reflecting balanced market activity.

The cuts would bring the upper bound of the Fed\u2019s target range to 3.5%. The economists, including Michael Gapen, noted that 'Softer inflation and weakening labor market conditions give the Fed room to move more quickly toward a neutral policy stance.' They anticipate a pause after January to assess inflation, with further cuts in April and July as labor market deterioration continues. Morgan Stanley previously forecasted quarterly 25\u2011basis\u2011point cuts through December 2026, but now projects a quicker pace while maintaining its terminal rate forecast. The economists argue against a larger 50\u2011basis\u2011point cut this month because the unemployment rate remains low and the fed funds rate is already 100 basis points closer to neutral after last year\u2019s one\u2011point cut.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 02:17 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!
