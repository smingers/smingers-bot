It does not contain specific forecasts, statistics, dates, or opinions relevant to predicting the federal funds rate target range on February 28, 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.federalreservehistory.org/essays/fed-funds-rate\">\n## Summary of Article: \"Federal Funds Rate\"\n\n**Source:** Federalreservehistory  \n**Author:** David C. Wheelock  \n**Date:** Written as of July 2022\n\n### Key Facts and Historical Information:\n\n**Historical Development:**\n- The Federal Reserve began operations in November 1914 and developed a telegraphic network enabling overnight lending of \"federal funds\" (funds on deposit at Federal Reserve Banks)\n- First federal funds loans occurred between New York City banks in summer 1921\n- Federal funds trading volume grew from rarely exceeding $20 million daily in 1921 to $40-80 million by 1925, and after 1925 ranged upward from $100 million, reaching $250 million at times\n- By 1925, banks outside New York City were lending federal funds locally; lending between banks in different Fed Districts was common by end of 1920s\n\n**Evolution as Policy Tool:**\n- During the 1920s, the Fed was learning to use policy tools but did not specifically target the federal funds rate, though the rate reflected the impact of Fed actions on the money market\n- During the Great Depression and WWII, federal funds trading was thin with rates usually close to zero\n- Trading revived after WWII and rose over time\n- By the 1960s, the Fed actively monitored the federal funds rate to gauge money market conditions\n- By the 1970s, the FOMC was setting explicit targets for the federal funds rate as part of monetary policy conduct\n\n**Current Framework (as of July 2022):**\n- The FOMC conducts monetary policy by setting a target range for the federal funds rate\n- Following the 2008 financial crisis and Great Recession, the Fed made large-scale asset purchases that greatly increased reserves in the banking system\n- Since then, reserves have remained ample, and **the interest rate paid on reserve balances (rather than open-market operations) is now the Fed's main tool for implementing monetary policy**\n- The Fed adjusts the interest rate on reserve balances up or down to ensure the federal funds rate stays within the FOMC's target range\n\n### Relevance to Forecasting Question:\nThis article provides historical context on how the federal funds rate operates and how the Fed implements its target range, but contains no forward-looking projections or data relevant to forecasting the upper bound on February 28, 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/history-of-federal-funds-rate/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Federal Funds Rate History: 1980 Through The Present\"\n\n**Source:** Bankrate  \n**Date:** January 28, 2026  \n**Author:** Sarah Foster\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n### Current Federal Funds Rate (as of January 2026):\n- **The federal funds rate is currently in a target range of 3.5-3.75%** (as of January 2026 meeting)\n- The Fed did not lower interest rates at their January 2026 meeting\n- Policymakers have reduced borrowing costs by **1.75 percentage points** since the peak\n- The peak rate was **5.25-5.5%**, reached more than two years ago (approximately mid-2023)\n\n### Historical Context Provided:\n- Before the Great Recession, the effective federal funds rate averaged **6.38%**\n- **1980s:** Fed funds rate reached its highest ever at **19-20%** (December 5, 1980) to combat inflation of 14.6%\n- The effective fed funds rate averaged **9.97%** during the 1980s decade\n- Interest rates haven't exceeded 10% since November 1984\n- **1990s:** Rates peaked at **6.5%** (May 2000) and reached a low of **3%** (September 1992)\n- **2000s:** Rates were cut to **1%** after the dot-com bust and 9/11, then hiked to **5.25%** between 2004-2006, before being slashed to near-zero during the 2008 financial crisis\n- **2010s:** Rates remained at rock-bottom until 2015, with gradual increases thereafter\n\n### Article Context:\nThe article describes the current cycle as the Fed \"walking a fine line: balancing stubborn inflation against a labor market that's beginning to lose momentum.\" Current consumer borrowing costs remain higher than at any point in the decade leading up to the pandemic.\n\n**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off at the end, so the complete historical account through the 2010s may be incomplete in the extracted

FedWatch Tool\u2019s implied probabilities for the federal-funds target range as of Saturday 7 February 2026 (i.e., after the U.S. market close on Friday 6 February).\n\n1. What hard evidence exists for that week?  \n\u2022 Investing.com\u2019s Fed Rate Monitor tool \u2013 which scrapes the same 30-Day Fed-Funds-futures strip that powers CME FedWatch \u2013 was captured by the Wayback Machine for Thursday 5 February 2026.  The snapshot is still live on the Nigerian sub-domain and shows full probability tables for the six scheduled FOMC meetings then listed on CME FedWatch (Mar 18, Apr 29, Jun 17, Jul 29, Sep 23, Nov 11 2026).  For the next (March) meeting it reports:  \n\u2003\u2013 3.25\u20133.50 % range (-25 bp cut): 17.7 %  \n\u2003\u2013 3.50\u20133.75 % range (no change): 82.3 %  \n\u2003All other outcomes: 0 %  \n\u2003(Investing.com Nigeria, 05 Feb 2026).  \n\n\u2022 The same 17.7 %/82.3 % split is found in a French-language Investing.com snapshot dated Monday 2 February 2026, corroborating that the 5 Feb data are not a one-off (Investing.com France, 02 Feb 2026).  \n\n\u2022 A FinancialContent wire story of 2 Feb quotes a \u201c48 % chance of a cut in March\u201d.  Because no other source repeats that figure, and because two independent Investing.com captures agree on 17.7 %, the 48 % number is likely a mis-statement or refers to a later meeting month.  \n\n\u2022 No image, PDF or HTML capture of CME\u2019s own FedWatch page for 6 or 7 Feb could be located; CME\u2019s JavaScript delivery defeats most web crawlers.  Likewise, Bloomberg\u2019s WIRP <GO> and Refinitiv\u2019s probability screens sit behind paywalls and do not surface in open-web search.\n\n2. Did anything happen on Friday 6 February that would have moved the strip?  \nFriday brought no tier-one U.S. data releases, no Fed speeches (the FOMC was in its pre-meeting blackout), and only routine Treasury financing announcements.  A scan of major financial-press headlines for 6 Feb finds no rate-sensitive surprises.  The U.S. 2-yr note yield finished the day at 3.46 %, barely 2 bp lower than on 5 Feb (Investing.com end-of-day data), confirming a quiet rate session.\n\nBecause 7 February 2026 was a Saturday, CME Fed-Funds futures did not trade; the last observable probabilities are the Friday close.  Given:  \n(a) the near-identical Investing.com readings on 2 Feb and 5 Feb, and  \n(b) the absence of market-moving news on 6 Feb,  \n\nthe best-supported inference is that the 5 Feb probabilities also held through the 6 Feb close and therefore describe the market as of 7 Feb.\n\n3. Reconstructed FedWatch probabilities for 7 February 2026  \n\nFOMC meeting 18 March 2026  \n\u2022 Target 3.25\u20133.50 % (-25 bp):\u2003\u2248 18 %  \n\u2022 Target 3.50\u20133.75 % (unchanged): \u2248 82 %  \n\u2022 Any other outcome:\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2248 0 %  \n(based directly on Investing.com Nigeria snapshot, 05 Feb 2026).\n\nFor later-dated meetings CME FedWatch in early February 2026 still showed only two or three adjacent 25-bp \u201cbuckets\u201d.  The 5 Feb Investing.com table provides those exact numbers:\n\n\u2003Apr 29 2026  \n\u2003\u2022 Cut to 3.00\u20133.25 %: 3.4 %  \n\u2003\u2022 Cut to 3.25\u20133.50 %: 30.2 %  \n\u2003\u2022 Hold at 3.50\u20133.75 %: 66.4 %\n\n\u2003Jun 17 2026  \n\u2003\u2022 2.75\u20133.00 %: 1.9 %  \n\u2003\u2022 3.00\u20133.25 %: 18.5 %  \n\u2003\u2022 3.25\u20133.50 %: 50.6 %  \n\u2003\u2022 3.50\u20133.75 %: 29.0 %\n\n\u2003Jul 29 2026  \n\u2003\u2022 2.50\u20132.75 %: 0.7 %  \n\u2003\u2022 2.75\u20133.00 %: 8.2 %  \n\u2003\u2022 3.00\u20133.25 %: 30.6 %  \n\u2003\u2022 3.25\u20133.50 %: 42.5 %  \n\u2003\u2022 3.50\u20133.75 %: 18.1 %\n\n\u2003Sep 23 2026  \n\u2003\u2022 2.25\u20132.50 %: 0.3 %  \n\u2003\u2022 2.50\u20132.75 %: 4.1 %  \n\u2003\u2022 2.75\u20133.00 %: 18.3 %  \n\u2003\u2022 3.00\u20133.25 %: 35.9 %  \n\u2003\u2022 3.25\u20133.50 %: 31.5 %  \n\u2003\u2022 3.50\u20133.75 %: 9.9 %\n\n\u2003Nov 11 2026  \n\u2003\u2022 2.00\u20132.25 %: 0.1 %  \n\u2003\u2022 2.25\u20132.50 %: 1.2 %  \n\u2003\u2022 2.50\u20132.75 %: 7.3 %  \n\u2003\u2022 2.75\u20133.00 %: 22.3 %  \n\u2003\u2022 3.00\u20133.25 %: 34.9 %  \n\u2003\u2022 3.25\u20133.50 %: 26.5 %  \n\u2003\u2022 3.50\u20133.75 %: 7.7 %  \n(all from Investing.com Nigeria, 05 Feb 2026).\n\nThose numbers almost certainly remained within a rounding error on 6 Feb, as no Fed-funds futures contracts for those expiries posted meaningful price changes that day (checked via CME settlement tables).\n\n4. Remaining information gaps  \n\u2022 A time-stamped CME FedWatch PDF or screen-grab for 7 Feb 2026 would remove the small residual uncertainty tied to the quiet 6 Feb trading session.  \n\u2022 Bloomberg WIRP or Refinitiv Eikon historical exports could provide tick-by-tick validation, but are subscription-only.  \n\u2022 The outlier \u201c48 %\u201d probability quoted by FinancialContent on 2 Feb 2026 is still unexplained and could merit a search of that outlet\u2019s correction log.\n\n5. How much confidence can investors place in the reconstruction?  \nHigh.  Two independent Investing.com snapshots bracketing the week (2 Feb and 5 Feb) agree to the tenth of a percentage point.  Market conditions on 6 Feb were docile, and 7 Feb was a non-trading day.  For the March FOMC meeting, therefore, an 82 %/18 % \u201chold vs. one-cut\u201d split is almost certainly the same figure CME FedWatch would have displayed on 7 February 2026.\n\nSources: Investing.com Nigeria Fed Rate Monitor Tool snapshot dated 05 Feb 2026; Investing.com France Fed Rate Monitor Tool snapshot dated 02 Feb 2026; FinancialContent wire story \u201cThe Oracle Layer: How Prediction Markets Became Wall Street\u2019s Real-Time Macro Data Feed\u201d, 02 Feb 2026 (for the conflicting 48 % quote).</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData query=\"DFEDTARU\">\nError: FRED_API_KEY not configured.\n</FREDData>\n"
