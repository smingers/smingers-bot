### International Context (Low relevance):
- Dominican Republic, Portugal, Mexico, China, Taiwan, Japan, Argentina prices
- **Weight**: NEGLIGIBLE - Different markets with different pricing mechanisms

## (b) Evidence Analysis

### Strong Evidence:
1. **EIA weekly data showing upward trend**: From $2.907 (Jan 12) to $2.995 (Feb 2) = +$0.088 in three weeks. First week of February already at $2.995.
2. **Winter Storm Fern disruption**: Documented refinery slowdowns and demand spike of 900,000 bpd. Direct causal mechanism for price increases.
3. **Crude oil price increase**: $4/barrel increase from month ago, driven by geopolitical tensions. Historical correlation between crude and retail gasoline is very strong.

### Moderate Evidence:
1. **AAA/GasBuddy convergence**: Multiple independent sources showing national average $2.87-$2.88 in early February, consistent with EIA weekly data.
2. **Supply tightness**: Inventories below five-year average, West Coast summer-blend transition beginning.
3. **EIA STEO forecast**: Annual 2026 average "just over $2.90" suggests February should be near this level.

### Weak Evidence:
1. **Regional variation**: Some states declining (Ohio), others rising (Florida, California). Net effect unclear.
2. **Long-term structural trends**: EV adoption, efficiency improvements - irrelevant for one-month forecast.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Days until resolution**: 22 days (February 1-28, 2026)
- We have 1 week of data (Feb 2 = $2.995)
- Need 3 more weeks to complete the monthly average

**If timeframe halved** (11 days): Would rely more heavily on the Feb 2 reading ($2.995) with less opportunity for mean reversion. Confidence interval would narrow slightly.

**If timeframe doubled** (44 days, into March): Would incorporate March data, which historically sees spring price increases. Would shift distribution upward by ~$0.10-0.15 and widen uncertainty.

**Seasonal pattern**: February typically sees +$0.05 median vs January, but 2026 January averaged $2.936 (from outside view), suggesting February baseline around $2.95-3.00.

## (d) Justification and Distribution Calibration

### Checklist Item 2: Outside View Base Rate
- Six-month moving average (Aug 2025-Jan 2026): μ = 3.16, σ = 0.13
- February historical (2016-2025): μ = 2.71, σ = 0.54
- January 2026 actual: $2.936/gal

### Integration of Inside View:

**Anchoring on January 2026**: $2.936/gal provides the most relevant starting point, as February prices typically track within ±$0.10 of January.

**Key Adjustments**:

1. **Upward pressure from Winter Storm Fern** (+$0.03-0.06):
   - Refinery disruptions documented
   - Demand spike of 900k bpd
   - Early February weekly reading already at $2.995

2. **Crude oil price increase** (+$0.02-0.04):
   - $4/barrel increase translates to ~$0.03-0.05 at pump with typical lag
   - Geopolitical risk premium embedded

3. **First week data point** (strong signal):
   - Feb 2 reading of $2.995 is 6% into the month
   - If this holds for week, contributes heavily to monthly average
   - Suggests monthly average floor of ~$2.95

4. **Remaining uncertainty**:
   - Three weeks of data still to come
   - Weather could moderate (downward pressure)
   - Crude could retreat (downward pressure)
   - Or conditions could worsen (upward pressure)

**Scenario Analysis**:

- **Baseline scenario** (60% probability): Storm effects moderate, prices stabilize around $2.95-3.00. Monthly average: $2.96-3.00
- **Upside scenario** (20% probability): Continued cold, refinery issues persist, crude stays elevated. Monthly average: $3.00-3.10
- **Downside scenario** (20% probability): Quick weather recovery, demand normalizes, crude retreats. Monthly average: $2.90-2.96

### Checklist Item 3: Consistency Check
"Implied median = $2.98; mean = $2.99; this aligns with EIA weekly data ($2.995 on Feb 2) and accounts for storm disruption while allowing for some mean reversion."

### Checklist Item 4: Most Significant Evidence
1. **EIA Feb 2 weekly reading of $2.995** - factually valid, official source
2. **Winter Storm Fern causing 900k bpd demand spike and refinery slowdowns** - documented by EIA and AAA
3. **Crude oil up $4/barrel month-over-month to $62** - confirmed across multiple sources
4. **January 2026 monthly average of $2.936** - official EIA data, strong anchor
5. **Historical February pattern: typically +$0.05 vs January** - based on decade of data

### Checklist Item 5: Blind-spot Statement
**Most likely scenario to make forecast look silly**: 
"Major refinery fire or geopolitical shock (Iran conflict escalation) in mid-February pushes prices sharply upward to $3.20+, similar to 2022 Ukraine invasion effect."
This would push outcome **upward** beyond my 90th percentile.

Alternatively: "Storm effects were overstated, weather moderates quickly, crude collapses on peace talks, prices fall to $2.85 monthly average."
This would push outcome **downward** below my 10th percentile.

## Final Distribution Calibration

**Central tendency**: Given Feb 2 reading of $2.995 and storm disruption, I anchor the median at $2.98, slightly above January's $2.936.

**Uncertainty band**: 
- Historic one-month forecast error ≈ $0.15
- Current volatility from storm and crude movements suggests σ ≈ $0.12
- 80% confidence interval: ±$0.15 around median = [$2.83, $3.13]
- 90% interval: ±$0.20 = [$2.78, $3.18]

**Distribution shape**: Slightly right-skewed due to asymmetric upside risks (refinery disruptions, geopolitical shocks) vs. limited downside (prices already near recent lows).

**Percentile assignments**:
- P10: $2.80 (storm quickly resolves, prices drift down)
- P20: $2.87 (moderate weather recovery)
- P40: $2.94 (slight downward drift from Feb 2 level)
- P60: $3.01 (storm effects persist moderately)
- P80: $3.08 (continued disruption, crude stays elevated)
- P90: $3.16 (major supply disruption or geopolitical shock)

These bounds respect the platform's open range (1.5-7.5) while concentrating probability where evidence suggests most likely outcomes.
