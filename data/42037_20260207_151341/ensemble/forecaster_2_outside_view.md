Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**LendingTree (Jan 21, 2026):**

- 2025 monthly averages: December lowest at $2.89, September/April highest at $3.17
- Contains EIA forecast: 2026 annual average of $2.92/gal
- Quality: High - uses official EIA data; date is very recent (17 days before forecast period)
- Key fact: First time below $3.00 since May 2021 occurred in December 2025

**AFDC Energy (Oct 1-15, 2025):**
- Reports $3.14/gal for October 2025
- Quality: Moderate - official government source but 4 months old
- Less relevant given more recent data available

**EIA All Grades Data (Release: Feb 3, 2026):**
- Shows "All Grades" not "Regular" - different series than resolution criteria
- January 2026: $2.936/gal
- December 2025: $3.024/gal
- Quality: High but wrong data series - provides directional context only

**Hydrocarbon Engineering (Jan 14, 2026):**
- Reports EIA STEO forecast: 2026 annual average "just over $2.90/gal"
- Context: Lower crude oil prices expected (Brent $56/bbl vs 2025 levels)
- Quality: High - direct reporting of official EIA forecast
- Expert opinion: EIA institutional forecast

**Rigzone Diesel Article (Jan 28, 2026):**
- Focuses on diesel, not gasoline
- Quality: Not directly relevant to regular gasoline

**EIA Natural Gas Article (Feb 5, 2026):**
- About natural gas markets during winter storm
- Quality: Not directly relevant, though indicates energy market volatility in late January

**Agent Report:**
- Provides weekly January 2026 data: Jan 19 = $2.806, Jan 26 = $2.853
- Historical February averages 2016-2025: Mean = $2.71, StDev = $0.54
- Quality: Excellent - synthesizes official EIA data with statistical analysis
- Trend: Post-2021 plateau higher than pre-pandemic, but 2023-2025 shows gradual decline from 2022 peak

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **Last 10 Februaries (2016-2025):** Mean $2.71, SD $0.54 - includes both low-price era (2016-2020) and post-pandemic spike
2. **Recent Februaries (2023-2025):** $3.52, $3.39, $3.21, $3.12 - shows clear downward trend from 2022 peak
3. **Recent monthly data (Q4 2025 - Jan 2026):** Oct $3.19, Nov $3.18, Dec $3.02, Jan ~$2.83 (based on weekly averages)

**Most suitable:** Recent monthly trend (Q4 2025 - Jan 2026) combined with recent February pattern (2023-2025 decline). The 10-year February average includes pre-pandemic prices that are structurally different from current market conditions. The recent 3-4 month trend shows continued decline and is most relevant.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** February 2026 starts in 0 days (today is Feb 7) and the month completes in 21 days.

**Historical February patterns:**
- February typically shows slight increase from January in recent years (2023-2025 Februaries averaged +$0.09 vs their preceding Januaries)
- However, 2025 showed February $3.12 vs January $3.20 (decline of $0.08)
- Seasonal pattern: Winter months can show volatility due to heating demand and refinery maintenance

**Current trajectory:**
- January 2026 weekly data: $2.806 (Jan 19) → $2.853 (Jan 26)
- This suggests January monthly average around $2.83-2.85
- Current trend shows stabilization/slight uptick in late January

## (d) Justification

The outside view should center on **$2.85-2.95 range** based on:

1. **Recent momentum:** January 2026 weekly data ($2.81-2.85) establishes a baseline significantly below recent years
2. **EIA institutional forecast:** $2.92/gal annual average for 2026 provides expert anchor
3. **Seasonal adjustment:** February historically runs slightly higher than January, but 2025 broke this pattern
4. **Structural factors:** Lower crude oil prices expected to persist (Brent $56/bbl forecast)
5. **Downward trend continuation:** Clear decline from Dec 2025 ($3.02) → Jan 2026 (~$2.83)

**Key uncertainties:**
- Winter Storm Fern impact in late January may affect early February prices
- Refinery maintenance season could create temporary supply constraints
- Geopolitical risks (not mentioned in sources but always present)
- Weather volatility affecting demand

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring points:**
- January 2026 baseline: ~$2.83 (from weekly data)
- EIA 2026 annual forecast: $2.92
- Recent February trend: 2025 = $3.12, 2024 = $3.21, 2023 = $3.39

**Distribution considerations:**

The 10-year February standard deviation of $0.54 is inflated by the 2022 spike ($3.52). Recent volatility is lower. However, given:
- Only 21 days until month end
- Strong recent downward trend
- Structural shift to lower prices
- But potential for weather/refinery disruptions

I'll construct a distribution with:
- Central tendency: $2.85-2.95 (reflecting slight increase from January baseline toward EIA annual forecast)
- Moderate spread: Acknowledging that we're early in the month with incomplete data
- Asymmetric risk: Slightly higher upside risk (supply disruptions, weather) than downside (continued decline)
- 90/10 range: approximately $2.60-3.20 (wider than recent monthly volatility to account for unknowns)

**Calibration check:**
- P10 ($2.65): Represents continued sharp decline - unlikely but possible if oversupply persists
- P50 ($2.90): Aligns with EIA annual forecast and modest increase from January
- P90 ($3.15): Captures risk of supply disruption or weather impact, but below 2025 February level
