### 1) Target / resolution criteria (paraphrase)
**EIA “U.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices” monthly average for February 2026, in USD per gallon.**

---

## (a) Source analysis (what each says, quality, date)

1) **EIA weekly U.S. regular retail gasoline prices table** (EIA; updated Feb 3, 2026; includes week ending **Feb 2: $2.995/gal**, plus January weeks)  
- **Factual:** Official weekly retail price observations for the same concept family as the resolving series (EIA retail prices).  
- **Quality:** **Very high** (primary source; directly tied to resolution).  
- **Use:** Anchor for “where February is starting” and near-term momentum.

2) **AAA / local-news rewrites of AAA snapshots (Florida, Idaho, Alabama, Patch, etc.)** (Feb 2–6, 2026)  
- **Factual:** These report **AAA/GasBuddy-type national averages around ~$2.87–$2.90** in early Feb.  
- **Opinion:** Some commentary about geopolitical tensions, supply tightness, winter storms.  
- **Quality:** **Moderate**—AAA/GasBuddy are reputable, but (i) not the resolving dataset, and (ii) the national number differs systematically from EIA’s weekly series at times.

3) **GasBuddy outlook snippets quoted in articles** (late Jan–early Feb 2026)  
- **Factual:** Claims like “2026 annual average ~$2.97” (GasBuddy) and narratives about being below $3 and rising later in Feb.  
- **Quality:** **Moderate**—methodology is plausible, but it’s not the resolution source; good for seasonal direction.

4) **MoneyDJ article summarizing EIA/IEA outlook** (Feb 3, 2026)  
- **Factual (as reported):** Mentions **EIA expecting Brent ~ $55 in Q1 2026** and an oversupplied 2026 market (IEA).  
- **Quality:** **Moderate**—secondary reporting, but points to a clear macro driver (crude price level).

5) **Stacker/kearneyhub piece claiming national average $3.46** (Feb 2, 2026)  
- **Factuality concerns:** Conflicts sharply with EIA weekly (~$3.00) and multiple AAA/GasBuddy reports (~$2.85–$2.90).  
- **Quality:** **Low** for this question; I treat it as likely mismatched geography/series/timing or a data extraction issue.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

### Strong evidence (can move forecast meaningfully)
- **EIA weekly series entering February at ~$2.995 (Feb 2)** and rising from mid-January (~$2.907 on Jan 12 to ~$2.995 on Feb 2).  
  *Mechanism:* the monthly average for Feb will be dominated by Feb weekly readings; starting point is already ~3.00.

### Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
- **Seasonality / transition dynamics:** Many years see prices firm into late Feb/early spring (even if crude is range-bound) due to refinery maintenance, early blend transitions in some regions, and demand normalization as winter storms pass.  
- **Crude oil around low-to-mid $60s WTI in early Feb articles** (and Brent forecast lower): suggests **no 2022-style spike**, but does not preclude a modest late-month rise of 5–20 cents at retail.

### Weak evidence (small adjustments)
- **Local anecdotes** (e.g., specific state spikes/dips; winter storm disruptions): real, but often regional and noisy for a national monthly mean.  
- **Geopolitical-tension commentary** without a quantified, sustained crude shock: upside risk, but weak unless it translates into observable crude/refined price jumps.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Today:** 2026-02-07.  
- **Remaining time in target month:** ~**21 days**.  
- Because the month is already underway, the final February monthly average will be heavily constrained by:  
  - the **already-known early-Feb level (~$3.00 in EIA weekly)**, and  
  - whatever happens in the next ~3 EIA weekly observations.

**If the remaining time were halved (~10 days left):** I’d narrow the range and pull the median closer to ~$3.00 (less time for shocks).  
**If doubled (hypothetically two months of exposure):** I’d widen the range and re-center closer to the broader 2026 annual expectations (~$2.9–$3.0), because reversion/seasonal patterns would matter more.

## (d) Justification (updating the outside view)

**Outside-view base rate provided:** median around **$2.90** with a 10–90 of roughly **$2.65–$3.15**.

**Key update:** the *inside view* now has an important fact: **EIA week of Feb 2 is $2.995/gal**, and late January was already trending upward. That alone makes a February *monthly* average below ~2.85 less likely unless there is a meaningful mid/late-month drop.

However, macro context (EIA/IEA oversupply narrative; crude not extreme) argues against a large sustained surge. So I shift the distribution **up modestly** (center near ~$3.02) and keep a **moderately wide** interval to respect refinery/outage/weather/geopolitical tail risks.

**Trend-continued scenario (status quo):** If weekly values hover around **$2.98–$3.08** for the rest of the month, the monthly average likely lands near **$3.00–$3.05**.

## Quick checklist (sanity + calibration)
1) **Target:** EIA monthly avg regular all formulations, **Feb 2026**, **$/gal**.  
2) **Outside view anchor:** median **~$2.90** (from prompt).  
3) **Consistency:** implied median ~**$3.02**; implied mean ~**$3.03** (slightly right-skew). Plausible given early-Feb ~3.00 and upside tail risks.  
4) **Top evidence (<=20 words each):**  
   - EIA weekly Feb 2: **$2.995/gal** (already near $3).  
   - Late-Jan to early-Feb EIA weekly **uptrend**.  
   - Crude ~$60–$65 and oversupply outlook limits extreme spikes.  
   - Seasonal late-winter firmness/refinery factors add mild upside risk.  
5) **Blind spot scenario:** a sudden crude drop + rapid retail pass-through (or demand collapse) could push February average **materially below $2.90**.
