Target variable (paraphrased in 20 words)  
“EIA-reported U.S. monthly average retail price, regular gasoline, February 2026, dollars per gallon.”

--------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Source analysis  (chronological, most-relevant first)

1. EIA weekly table, released 3 Feb 2026 – FACTS: 29 Dec 25 = 2.940, 5 Jan = 2.925, 12 Jan = 2.907, 19 Jan = 2.933, 26 Jan = 2.980, 2 Feb = 2.995.  Highest-quality primary data; no opinion content.

2. AAA / GasBuddy national snapshots (numerous local articles, 2-6 Feb 2026) – FACTS: give national average 2.87-2.90 $/gal, confirm slight week-on-week rise.  Reliable but secondary; minor methodology differences vs EIA.  OPINION: analysts expect modest further increases (Patrick De Haan, AAA spokespeople).

3. Lake Okeechobee News (2 Feb 26) – FACTS: national 2.870 $/gal; Florida 2.91.  Opinion: prices “may keep climbing” – moderate credibility (AAA).

4. Idaho AAA note (2 Feb) – FACTS: WTI ~62 $/bbl (+4 $ m/m).  Opinion: cold weather & demand could lift prices – moderate evidence.

5. EIA January Short-Term Energy Outlook press pick-ups (mid-Jan 26) – FACTS: STEO projects 2026 U.S. annual average gasoline 2.9 $/gal and Brent ~55 $/bbl.  High-quality forecast but broad, not month-specific.

6. MoneyDJ and OilPrice stories (late Jan–early Feb) – FACTS: national average 2.83-2.87; diesel down; note global oversupply forecast.  Opinions: long-term downward pressure from EVs, surplus crude – weak to moderate for one-month horizon.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong evidence  
• EIA weekly series shows level and recent +9 ¢ rise in three weeks.  
• February is historically a “winter-low” month that seldom deviates >30 ¢ from January barring shocks (structural pattern).

Moderate evidence  
• AAA/GasBuddy corroborate a high-2 $ national average with slight upward momentum.  
• WTI at 62 $ (vs EIA 55 $ annual forecast) supports marginally higher pump prices than STEO baseline.  
• Weather-related refinery hiccups noted by AAA could keep prices firm a few more weeks.

Weak evidence  
• Forward-looking claims of big price drops driven by EV penetration (structural but long-term).  
• Local anecdotal sub-2 $ stations (idiosyncratic tax/competition effects, little impact on national monthly mean).

(c) Timeframe analysis  

Days until last price that counts: ~21.  Each new EIA weekly print (Feb 9, 16, 23) carries roughly 25 % weight in the final monthly mean.  If the horizon were halved (10 days), volatility risk would fall; if doubled (40 days), refinery-turnaround/summer-blend risks would enlarge the upper tail.

(d) Justification – from outside-view to inside-view

Outside-view base rate: mean February price last five years = 3.15 $/gal, median 3.10, σ ≈ 0.25.  BUT January 2026 came in far below recent years (~2.93), reflecting lower crude and ample supply.  Therefore base-rate anchor = January 2026 figure (2.93).

Adjustments  
+0.05 – Seasonal tendency Feb > Jan by about five-to-eight cents in 4 of past 5 years.  
+0.03 – WTI now 62 $ versus mid-50s assumption in STEO; adds a few cents to pumps if sustained.  
+0.01 – Cold-weather refinery constraints already evident (late-Jan uptick).  
−0.02 – Structural oversupply narrative and muted demand keep a lid on explosive upside.

Centre of distribution = 2.93 + 0.07 ≈ 3.00 $/gal.

Spread  
Historical σ ≈ 0.25.  With only three weeks left, shrink σ by one-third ⇒ 0.17.  Add tail room for a surprise refinery outage or crude slide (+/-0.30).  Results in a 10-to-90 range roughly 2.65–3.35.

Forecasting checklist (abbrev.)

1. Variable aligned?  Yes – EIA monthly regular gasoline, Feb 2026, $/gal.  
2. Base rate used?  Jan 2026 = 2.93 $/gal.  
3. Consistency line: median = 3.05, mean ≈ 3.06 – fits rationale (slightly above January).  
4. Key evidence:  
   a) EIA weekly 2 Feb = 2.995.  
   b) Four-year pattern Feb > Jan by ~0.06.  
   c) WTI at 62 $, above STEO baseline.  
   d) AAA/GasBuddy confirm national avg ~2.88-2.90 early Feb with upward drift.  
   e) No major refinery outages announced (caps upside).  
5. Blind-spot: Gulf Coast refinery fire next week pushing wholesale up 40 ¢ – would move outcome above 3.40 $/gal.
