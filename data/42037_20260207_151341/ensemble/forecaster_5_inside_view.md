FORECASTING CHECKLIST (condensed)
1. Target variable: EIA “U.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Price – Monthly” for February 2026, in dollars per gallon.
2. Outside-view base rate (10 previous Februaries 2016-25): mean 2.71 $/gal, st.dev 0.54 $/gal.
3. Internal consistency: median ≈ 3.05, mean ≈ 3.04 – both coherent with evidence and tails.
4. Top evidence
   • Latest EIA weekly price (Mon 2 Feb 2026) 2.995 $/gal – hard data, up 6 ¢ in three weeks.  
   • January-2026 monthly average will be ≈ 2.94 $/gal (4–5 Monday mean).  
   • AAA / GasBuddy national averages sit 2.87–2.90 and have been flat the last fortnight.  
   • EIA STEO (Jan-14) projects “just over 2.90 $/gal” annual 2026 average.  
   • No major crude-oil or refinery disruption on horizon; Brent stabilised near 55–62 $/bbl.
5. Blind-spot: Sudden refinery fire or Middle-East escalation adding >10 $/bbl to crude in mid-Feb (would push outcome above my 90th, toward 3.40+).

-------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Source analysis (abridged)

1. EIA weekly table (release 03 Feb 26).  Primary, official, factual.  Latest weekly regular-grade price 2.995 $/gal.  Strong.
2. EIA monthly table (through Jan 26).  Gives January mean ≈ 2.94 $/gal.  Strong.
3. AAA / GasBuddy pieces (Feb 2-6).  Nationwide averages 2.87-2.90, slight week-on-week rise.  Good quality, consistent, but different methodology – Moderate.
4. MoneyDJ & KESQ summaries quote GasBuddy analyst Patrick De Haan.  Expert commentary; notes mild upside risk on West Coast, otherwise stable.  Moderate.
5. LakeOkeechobee News, Idaho AAA, Alabama local media.  Early-Feb state snapshots.  Corroborate national figures; anecdotal – Weak to Moderate.
6. CME promotional page, historical 1990s table.  No relevant forward info – Ignored.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong:
• EIA weekly 2.995 and upward short-run trend (+9 ¢ since mid-Jan).  
• Historical Jan→Feb mean change +4 ¢; Feb variance typically ±10–15 ¢.

Moderate:
• AAA / GasBuddy national 2.87-2.90, flat; suggests EIA may plateau near 3.00 rather than surge.  
• EIA STEO “just over 2.90” annual outlook implies no large spikes expected.

Weak:
• Local reports of weather-related refinery hiccups; so far transitory.  
• Speculative geopolitical chatter.

Net: evidence leans to a February average a few cents above three dollars, with symmetric moderate uncertainty and a fatter upper tail for shock risk.

(c) Timeframe analysis

We are 21 days from the last Monday observation (Feb 24).  Roughly 60 % of the data points that will make up the monthly mean are still unknown.  Halving this window (to Feb 14) would cut uncertainty by ~35 %; doubling (predicting March instead) would widen st.dev. by ~20 ¢.

(d) Justification / adjustment

Base-rate centre 2.71 $/gal → add
+0.23 to reach January-26 actual 2.94  
+0.06 for observed early-Feb uptick  
Net base centre ≈ 3.03 $/gal.

One-month realised volatility last decade ≈ 12 ¢; I double this to 24 ¢ (2 σ) to cover tail shocks, then fatten the upper tail slightly because upside spikes are more abrupt than plunges.
