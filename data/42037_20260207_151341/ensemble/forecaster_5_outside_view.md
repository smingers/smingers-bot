Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. LendingTree article (21 Jan 2026) – cites AAA/EIA data showing the national average gasoline price at $2.84 on 15 Jan 2026 and gives 2025 monthly highs/lows.  Factual; author is a finance reporter, data are from government/AAA.  Timely (three weeks old).  
2. AFDC price snapshot (Oct 2025) – historical only; regular gasoline $3.14.  Lower relevance because it is four months old.  
3. EIA monthly price table (release 3 Feb 2026) – primary source.  Gives January-2026 “All grades” = $2.936 and the regular-grade series through December 2025.  Highest quality, most recent official data.  
4. Hydrocarbon Engineering summary of EIA January-2026 STEO (14 Jan 2026) – expert forecast: 2026 annual average “just over $2.90”.  Source quotes EIA, which is the same agency that will publish the resolving number; high credibility.  
5. Rigzone diesel article (28 Jan 2026) – mostly diesel; only indirectly relevant.  
6. EIA Today-in-Energy natural-gas article (5 Feb 2026) – shows severe cold snap but pertains to gas (methane) not gasoline; only minor indirect relevance.  
7. Agent report – pulls the weekly regular-grade series: 19 Jan $2.806, 26 Jan $2.853; lists the last ten February averages (2016-25) and computes mean $2.71, σ ≈ 0.54.  Uses the exact series that will resolve the question; solid factual content, produced 7 Feb 2026.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• Same-series February averages 2016-25 (10 data pts) – captures month-specific seasonality.  
• Same-series full-year averages 2016-25 (10 data pts) – broader but dilutes seasonality.  
• All-grades series or CPI motor-fuel index – not identical to resolving series.  
Chosen class: February-only regular-grade averages 2016-25 (mean 2.71, σ 0.54).  It matches month and product, giving a clean baseline.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today: 7 Feb 2026.  The month is 24 days from completion; the EIA February average will be the mean of the five weekly quotes that fall wholly or partly in February (typically four or five Mondays).  Two of those observations (3 Feb and 10 Feb) are already known internally to EIA but not yet released; three to four weeks of price evolution remain.

Price behaviour from Jan→Feb: in 7 of the last 10 years, February averaged 3–6 ¢/gal higher than January; in the other three it was lower by 2–5 ¢.  The mean Jan→Feb change over 2016-25 is +4 ¢.

(d) Justification for outside-view baseline  
• Latest published weekly price (26 Jan) is $2.853.  
• January 2026 monthly average for regular grade (unpublished but inferred from the four Mondays likely around $2.85–2.87).  
• Adding the historical +4 ¢ seasonal bump gives a mechanical February point estimate ≈ $2.90.  
• EIA STEO annual outlook (“just over $2.90”) is consistent with that figure.  
• Crude prices are projected to stay soft (Brent in the mid-50s $/bbl) and refinery utilization is normal; no hurricane or geopolitical disruption is evident.  The big energy story now is natural-gas tightness due to Winter Storm Fern, which should exert little direct pressure on gasoline.  
Hence an outside-view centre of gravity at about $2.90/gal looks well-anchored.

Outside view calibration:

Distribution shape – gasoline has occasionally shown 30-40 ¢ month-to-month swings when crude spiked (e.g., Mar-Apr 2022), but with crude in a narrow band the one-month volatility is closer to ±10–15 ¢ (one σ).  To allow for tail-risk shocks (Middle-East escalation, major refinery outage) I widen the 80 % interval to roughly ±25 ¢ and the 90 % interval to roughly –40 ¢ / +45 ¢ from the centre.

Anchor: median ≈ $2.93 (slightly above the mechanical 2.90 because the first Monday of February often carries a bit of January’s lower price).  
One-sigma ≈ 0.12 → 68 % band 2.81-3.05.  
Two-sigma ≈ 0.24 → 95 % band 2.69-3.17.  
I fatten the upper tail slightly because price spikes are more violent than drops (prices seldom fall below $2 in today’s tax/regulation environment).
