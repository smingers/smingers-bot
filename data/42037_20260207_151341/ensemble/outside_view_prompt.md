**Source Information:**
- Publication: Hydrocarbon Engineering
- Date: January 14, 2026
- Author: Ellie Brosnan

## Key Facts and Statistics Relevant to the Question:

### Retail Gasoline Prices:
- **2026 forecast:** US gasoline prices will average **just over US$2.90/gallon** for the full year
- **2027 forecast:** Prices expected to remain mostly flat at an annual average of just over US$2.90/gallon
- **Comparison:** This represents a decrease of nearly US$0.20/gallon from 2025 levels

### Supporting Context (Crude Oil Prices):
- **Brent crude oil:** Expected to average US$56/bbl in 2026 (19% less than 2025) and US$54/bbl in 2027
- **West Texas Intermediate (WTI):** Expected to average US$52/bbl in 2026 and US$50/bbl in 2027, down from US$65/bbl in 2025
- Lower gasoline prices in 2026-2027 largely reflect the forecast of lower crude oil prices

### Oil Supply/Demand Dynamics:
- Global oil production expected to exceed global oil demand in 2026, causing oil inventories to rise
- Global liquid fuels production expected to increase by 1.4 million bpd in 2026
- US crude oil production expected to decrease by less than 1% in 2026 after reaching a record 13.6 million bpd in 2025

**Note:** This article provides an annual average forecast for 2026 (just over $2.90/gallon) but does not provide month-specific forecasts for February 2026.

## Summary of Article: Record Natural Gas Stock Withdrawals During Week Ending January 30, 2026

**Source:** U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)  
**Date:** February 05, 2026

### Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Record withdrawal:** Working natural gas stocks fell 360 billion cubic feet (Bcf) in the Lower 48 states for the week ending January 30, 2026—the largest weekly net withdrawal in the history of the Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report.

2. **Comparison to average:** The withdrawal exceeded the five-year average for the same week by 89% (170 Bcf).

3. **Current stock levels:** Working gas stocks are now 1.1% below the five-year average for this time of year.

4. **Increased heating demand:** Natural gas consumption in residential and commercial sectors January 23–26 averaged 29% higher, or 13.9 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) more than the five-year average for those days (according to Bloomberg L.P.).

5. **Price impacts:** The U.S. benchmark natural gas spot price at the Henry Hub rose to $9.03 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) on January 28, which was:
   - $4.05/MMBtu higher than the week-earlier price
   - $5.60/MMBtu higher than the year-earlier price

### Contributing Factors:

- **Winter Storm Fern:** A massive winter storm brought extreme cold, heavy snow, and ice across a large portion of the Lower 48 states from New Mexico to New England (according to NOAA).

- **Production curtailments:** Extreme cold reduced natural gas production due to equipment freeze-offs and shut-ins. Temperatures along the U.S. Gulf Coast averaged below freezing on January 25, contributing to the largest shut-in reported during the week.

### Relevance to Forecasting Question:

While this article focuses on natural gas rather than gasoline prices, natural gas prices can have indirect effects on gasoline prices through energy market dynamics and production costs. The severe weather event in late January 2026 and its impact on energy markets provides context for the energy situation leading into February 2026.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve EIA weekly regular gasoline prices January 2026 and historical February averages; compute mean, stdev for last 10 Februaries; summarise trend
The Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes two closely-related data sets that answer the question:

1. Weekly U.S. regular gasoline retail price – series PET.EMM_EPMR_PTE_NUS_DPG, released every Monday in the “Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update”.
2. Monthly U.S. regular gasoline retail price – the same series, but aggregated to monthly frequency and published on the “U.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices” page.

A. Weekly observations for January 2026  
The most recent “Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update” (release date 3 Feb 2026) lists the national average for regular gasoline for the last two Mondays in January 2026:  
• 19 Jan 2026: $2.806 /gal  
• 26 Jan 2026: $2.853 /gal  (Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update, 3 Feb 2026)  

Those values come directly from the weekly PET.EMM_EPMR_PTE_NUS_DPG series. Data for the first two Mondays in January (5 Jan and 12 Jan 2026) are not shown in the excerpted table and would have to be pulled from the full weekly file; thus the January set is presently incomplete.

B. Historical February averages  
The monthly table for the same series provides national February averages back to 1990. The last ten February values available today are (EIA monthly table, release 3 Feb 2026):

Feb-2016  $1.764  
Feb-2017  $2.304  
Feb-2018  $2.587  
Feb-2019  $2.309  
Feb-2020  $2.442  
Feb-2021  $2.501  
Feb-2022  $3.517  
Feb-2023  $3.389  
Feb-2024  $3.212  
Feb-2025  $3.121  

(The February-2026 monthly average is not yet published because the month is still in progress.)

C. Mean and standard deviation, last 10 Februaries (2016-2025)  
• Mean = (Σ values) / 10  = $2.71 per gallon  
• Population standard deviation = √[(Σ (x–mean)²)/10] ≈ $0.54 per gallon  
(If a sample standard deviation is preferred, divide by 9 instead of 10; that yields ≈ $0.57.)

D. Trend analysis  
• 2016-2020: February prices hovered in the mid-$1.75–$2.60 range, rising slowly from the post-2014 oil-price crash.  
• 2021: A step-up to $2.50 as demand recovered from the pandemic and crude prices firmed.  
• 2022: A sharp jump to $3.52 – the highest February on record – driven by the post-COVID demand surge and the crude-oil price shock following the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  
• 2023-2025: Gradual retreat, but February prices remain above every pre-2021 February. The 2025 average of $3.12 is still about $0.60 higher than the 2016-2020 band, illustrating a new, higher post-pandemic plateau.  
• Forward look: EIA’s January-2026 Short-Term Energy Outlook projects a full-year 2026 average regular gasoline price of about $2.92 /gal, implying that February-2026 may continue to track slightly below recent Februarys but well above the pre-2021 era (Rigzone summary of January-2026 STEO).

E. Remaining information gaps  
1. The first two weekly observations for January 2026 (5 Jan and 12 Jan) are missing from the material provided. Retrieving them would allow calculation of a complete January weekly average.  
2. The February-2026 monthly average will not be available until EIA publishes the February update in early March 2026.  
3. If regional detail is desired, the Update table also contains the five PADD averages, but they were not requested.

If the missing January weeks are needed now, the full weekly CSV (PET.EMM_EPMR_PTE_NUS_DPG, weekly frequency) can be queried directly from the EIA site or via FRED once an API key is configured.

No additional searches are required to satisfy the original query beyond obtaining those two missing January-2026 points, should they be needed.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet/language models (for agent reports), so it is advisable to exercise healthy skepticism at your discretion.


Your analysis should have the following components, refering the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

You are free to include other components to deepen the analysis, at your discretion.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile location values can disproportionately reshape the slope and overall distribution of the extrapolated CDF, esepcially near the tails.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

It might be a good idea to set a wide 90/10 confidence intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

For your final outside view prediction, please keep in mind the following:
- Please notice the units requested (e.g. whether you represent a number as 1,000,000 or 1m).
- Never use scientific notation.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing.**
- Percentile 10 = low value (only 10% of outcomes fall below this)
- Percentile 90 = high value (90% of outcomes fall below this)
- Each percentile value must be GREATER than the previous one
