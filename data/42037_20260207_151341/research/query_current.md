Analysis:
The outcome will be the February 2026 monthly average that the EIA publishes around 10 March.  With the month just starting (today is 7 Feb), the best “inside-view” evidence comes from:

• EIA’s weekly “U.S. Regular All Formulations” retail price series – the 5 Feb 2026 value (first Monday of the month) is already available and will anchor about one quarter of the eventual monthly average.  
• Daily AAA national average, which provides near-real-time retail pricing and is often cited by media and analysts for intra-month movements.  
• Market commentary/analyst notes published in the past week that discuss near-term drivers (West Texas Intermediate trading at ~$78, refinery utilization after January maintenance, continuing Red Sea shipping disruptions, the mid-winter demand lull, etc.) and give price projections for the rest of February.  
• Any newly released EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO – next issue due 11 Feb) or investment-bank notes that update their February gasoline price assumptions.

Relevant articles/data will therefore be those that:
1. Quote the latest EIA weekly price (5 Feb) or AAA daily average (6–7 Feb).  
2. Discuss expected price trajectory for the remainder of February—e.g., whether refinery restarts will push prices down, or whether higher crude and stronger demand will lift them.  
3. Provide analyst point-estimates or ranges for the February monthly average, which can be compared to recent historical February averages ($3.42 in 2025, $3.38 in 2024, etc.).
