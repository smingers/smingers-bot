According to the Diario Oficial de la Federaci\u00f3n (DOF), the Secretar\u00eda de Hacienda y Cr\u00e9dito P\u00fablico (SHCP) has decided not to provide fiscal support for IEPS on these fuels. The elimination of the stimulus for Magna gasoline and diesel took effect on April 12, 2025, while Premium gasoline has not received such support since the second week of October 2023. The IEPS (a tax on production and sale of goods like gasoline, alcohol, beer, and tobacco) is an indirect tax: consumers pay it through the price, and businesses report it to the SAT. The IEPS amounts are: 6.70 pesos per liter for gasoline with octane rating below 91 (Magna), 5.65 pesos per liter for gasoline with octane rating 91 or higher (Premium), and 7.36 pesos per liter for diesel (100% tax rate). As of February 6, 2026, the national average price for Magna gasoline is 23.58 pesos per liter, a slight decrease from the previous week; Premium gasoline averages 25.73 pesos per liter; and diesel averages 26.39 pesos per liter. The cheapest gasoline is found in Reynosa, Tamaulipas (17.98 pesos per liter), the cheapest Premium in Piedras Negras, Coahuila (19.00 pesos per liter), and the cheapest diesel in Hermosillo, Sonora (17.66 pesos per liter). The fiscal stimulus policy, which adjusts weekly based on exchange rates, international reference prices, and logistics costs, is currently inactive.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 02:22 PM\nSource:[Milenio.com](https://www.milenio.com/negocios/gasolina-magna-sin-estimulo-precio-minimo-es-de-17-98-por-litro)\n\n**Here's how much Ohio gas prices declined from last week**\nOhio's average gas price declined to $2.69 per gallon on Monday, February 6, 2026, down from $2.88 per gallon the previous week, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). The state's average price has risen about 15 cents since last month. Over the past year, Ohio gas prices have ranged from a low of $2.53 on December 22, 2025, to a high of $3.41 on August 25, 2025.

This adjustment follows an increase in international crude oil prices, driven by two consecutive weeks of declining U.S. commercial crude oil inventories. The 7-day moving average of international crude oil prices as of February 5, 2026, reached 67.10 USD per barrel, up 0.62 USD from the previous week. The exchange rate of the New Taiwan Dollar to the U.S. Dollar was 31.596 NTD per USD, a depreciation of 0.177 NTD from the prior week. Without considering the Asian neighboring countries' lowest prices and stability measures, the projected retail price increase would have been +0.6 NTD for gasoline and +0.2 NTD for diesel. However, due to CNYC\u2019s stability measures, the actual forecast is a gasoline price decrease of 0.1\u20130.3 NTD and a diesel price increase of 0.1\u20130.3 NTD. The estimated reference retail prices for next week are: 92-octane gasoline at 27.1\u201327.3 NTD per liter, 95-octane gasoline at 28.6\u201328.8 NTD per liter, 98-octane gasoline at 30.6\u201330.8 NTD per liter, and super diesel at 26.4\u201326.7 NTD per liter.

According to the Fundaci\u00f3n Colsecor's Monthly Price Report, the average price of gasoline was $1,668 per liter in interior localities and $1,611 in the Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA), reflecting a 3.5% price gap, with higher prices outside the metropolitan area. In December, gasoline prices rose by 7.4% in the interior and 7.6% in CABA\u2014substantially above inflation. The annual cumulative increase reached 41.8% in the interior and 45.4% in CABA, with gasoline becoming 15% more expensive in real terms (in dollars) in the interior and 30% more expensive in CABA since the December 2023 devaluation. Diesel also saw strong increases, with a 41.8% rise in the interior and 42.7% in CABA annually, and a 13% increase in dollars in the interior and 24% in CABA since the devaluation. The government also announced new price updates for biofuels via Resolutions 24/2026 and 25/2026: biodiesel was set at $1,842,796 per tonne, while minimum acquisition prices for sugarcane-based bioethanol and maize-based bioethanol were fixed at $1,000,868 and $917,323 per liter, respectively, for February 2026.

The article explains that gas prices fluctuate due to factors such as crude oil costs, supply and demand, seasonal blends, and regional taxes and infrastructure. The lowest average prices were found in the South and Midwest, with Texas leading at $1.91 per gallon at Fresh by Brookshires and Sam's Club in Longview. Other low-cost states include Louisiana ($1.79), Missouri ($1.96), Iowa ($1.97), Kansas ($1.98), Oklahoma ($1.95), and Ohio ($1.99). In contrast, states like Hawaii ($3.59), California ($3.29), and Washington ($2.69) have the highest prices, driven by high taxes, isolation, and environmentally mandated fuel blends. The article notes that seasonal shifts, such as the use of winter-blend gasoline in colder months, can lower prices, while geopolitical and economic events\u2014like the 2022 oil crisis\u2014can cause spikes, with national averages reaching $4.93 per gallon in June 2022.

U.S. gasoline demand reached 8.757 million barrels per day in the week ending January 23, marking the highest level in five weeks. The top 10 highest-priced markets include Hawaii ($4.41), California ($4.26), Washington State ($3.88), Alaska ($3.44), Nevada ($3.40), Oregon ($3.40), Washington D.C. ($3.10), Pennsylvania ($3.01), Maryland ($2.99), and Vermont ($2.98). The lowest 10 markets are Oklahoma ($2.40), Arkansas ($2.43), Mississippi ($2.44), Louisiana ($2.46), Kansas ($2.47), Missouri ($2.49), Texas ($2.49), Tennessee ($2.52), Alabama ($2.52), and North Dakota ($2.52). According to GasBuddy, the national average dropped 0.9 cents to $2.83 per gallon on February 2, up 3.9 cents from one month ago, and down 21.3 cents from the same time last year. GasBuddy's data covers over 150,000 gas stations and is compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports. Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy's petroleum analyst, stated that oil prices have surged to multi-month highs amid geopolitical tensions, a weakening dollar, and supply concerns, yet the national average has remained relatively stable. He noted that rising prices in the western U.S. are driven by the upcoming summer fuel transition and expected refinery shutdowns in California in April, with more states likely to see price increases in the coming weeks. GasBuddy's 2026 Fuel Price Outlook predicts the national average gasoline price will fall below $3.00 per gallon for the first time since the pandemic, reaching $2.97 per gallon\u201413 cents lower than the 2025 average of $3.10. This reflects a long-term trend due to slowing oil demand growth, driven by rising electric vehicle adoption and improved energy efficiency. Despite supply disruptions, oil prices are constrained by structural demand shifts. The U.S. domestic oil production increase, highlighted by the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association, is a key factor in keeping prices low. This domestic supply acts as a buffer against global shocks. The IEA forecasts global oil supply will exceed demand by at least 3.8 million barrels per day in 2026, potentially the largest surplus in history. The EIA predicts Brent crude could fall to $55 per barrel in Q1 2026 and remain low, with a projected surplus of 2.2 million barrels per day for the year.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 11:02 PM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=d7840520-0a51-47e7-bf54-266636316518)\n\n**Pain at the pump: Gas prices increase across the board in February survey**\nGas prices in Bellingham, Whatcom County, and Washington increased in February compared to January, according to The Bellingham Herald's survey.

According to Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, oil prices rose due to geopolitical tensions, a weakening U.S. dollar, and supply concerns, yet the national average saw minimal change. Over half of U.S. states experienced declining prices, particularly Indiana and Ohio, while prices are rising across much of the West Coast as the transition to summer gasoline begins, with another refinery shutdown in California expected in April.

Check Today's Magna and Premium Prices in Mexico**\nOn Tuesday, February 3, 2026, fuel prices in Mexico remained a key concern for drivers. According to official data from the Comisi\u00f3n Nacional de Energ\u00eda (CNE), the national average price for regular gasoline (Magna) was $23.42 pesos per liter, while premium gasoline (Premium) averaged $27.12 pesos per liter in Nuevo Le\u00f3n\u2014the highest price for Premium in the country. The City of Mexico recorded the lowest national price for Magna at $23.42 pesos per liter. The report, published by TV Azteca, provides updated fuel pricing to help motorists plan expenses and optimize refueling decisions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 01:13 PM\nSource:[TV Azteca](https://www.tvazteca.com/aztecanoticias/precio-gasolina-hoy-3-febrero-2026-cdmx-mexico/)\n\n**China to Raise Gasoline and Diesel Prices on February 3, 2026: Final Pre-Holiday Discount Window Opens**\nOn February 3, 2026, China's national gasoline and diesel prices were adjusted upward, effective at 24:00 on February 3, meaning all fuel purchased before midnight on February 3 would be at the previous lower rate. The adjustment amounted to a 190 yuan per ton increase, translating to a 0.14\u20130.16 yuan per liter rise for 92-octane gasoline, 0.15\u20130.17 yuan per liter for 95-octane gasoline, and 0.16\u20130.18 yuan per liter for 0\u53f7 diesel, marking the largest single increase since the start of the year. The cumulative increase for 92-octane gasoline since January 20, 2026, reached over 395 yuan per ton. Nationwide, the national average price for 92-octane gasoline rose to nearly 6.9 yuan per liter. For average car owners, filling a 50-liter tank would cost an additional 7\u20138 yuan per fill, with monthly commuting costs increasing by about 50 yuan. For ride-hailing and truck drivers, the added cost is significant\u2014drivers could face an extra 3.36 yuan per day and 100 yuan per month after this adjustment, with truck drivers losing 360 yuan per month over 10 trips. The increase is attributed to a short-term surge in international crude oil prices due to geopolitical tensions (e.g., U.S.-Iran conflict), strong winter demand, and OPEC+'s decision to pause production increases. Domestic pricing follows a 10-day average of Brent, Dubai, and Oman crude prices, locking in the rise early in the cycle. Additional factors include rising freight costs and minor currency depreciation. The next price review is set for February 24, 2026, after the Lunar New Year, with no interim changes. Analysts predict a likely price decrease due to lower post-holiday demand and reduced heating needs. Experts advise against fuel stockpiling due to risks of degradation and fire hazards. Practical tips include refueling before 3 PM on February 3 to avoid crowds, using discounts at Sinopec and CNPC stations (up to 0.2 yuan per liter), and filling up in oil-producing regions like Xinjiang or Shaanxi where prices are as low as 6.6 yuan per liter. For commercial drivers, optimizing routes and joining fuel station membership programs can further reduce costs. Warning: Avoid unlicensed small stations (poor fuel quality), late-night queues (high idle fuel consumption), and prolonged idling. The price hike is unlikely to affect consumer goods prices, as logistics are well-prepared and the cost impact on transport is less than 0.5%. Looking ahead, 2026 is expected to see stable oil prices due to ample supply and weakening demand, with long-term trends favoring stability. The best strategy for drivers is to adopt fuel-efficient habits\u2014maintain steady speeds, avoid unnecessary electronics, and keep vehicles well-maintained\u2014to save hundreds annually. The key takeaway: act before the February 3, 24:00 deadline to lock in lower prices and minimize financial impact.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 02:13 AM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_7857201856_1d45362c0019020276.html)\n\n**Roanoke gas down 3.1 cents per gallon in the last week**\nAverage gasoline prices in Roanoke, Virginia, decreased by 3.1 cents per gallon in the past week, reaching $2.74 per gallon as of Monday, February 2, 2026, according to GasBuddy\u2019s survey of 155 stations. Prices are 8.9 cents higher than a month ago and 18.7 cents lower than a year ago. The national average gasoline price fell 0.9 cents per gallon over the same period, averaging $2.83 per gallon, and is up 3.9 cents from a month ago but down 21.3 cents from a year ago.

GasBuddy's dataset covers over 150,000 gas stations and is compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports. GasBuddy's '2026 Fuel Price Outlook' report forecasts that the U.S. annual average gasoline price will fall below $3.00 per gallon for the first time since the pandemic, with a predicted average of $2.97 per gallon in 2026\u201413 cents lower than the 2025 average of $3.10. The U.S. Department of Energy reports that the average unleaded gasoline price in 2020 was $2.17 per gallon. The American Automobile Association (AAA) reported last week's national average at $2.85 per gallon, up 6 cents from the previous week, down 5 cents from one month ago, and down 28 cents from the same time last year. AAA notes that this period typically sees the lowest gasoline demand, with demand expected to rise from late February to early March as temperatures warm. The top 10 most expensive U.S. markets for gasoline are: Hawaii ($4.41), California ($4.20), Washington State ($3.82), Alaska ($3.47), Nevada ($3.36), Oregon ($3.34), Washington D.C. ($3.09), Pennsylvania ($3.02), Vermont ($2.98), and Illinois ($2.98). The top 10 least expensive markets are: Oklahoma ($2.38), Arkansas ($2.42), Mississippi ($2.44), Kansas ($2.45), Texas ($2.45), Louisiana ($2.46), Tennessee ($2.48), Missouri ($2.48), Wisconsin ($2.51), and Alabama ($2.51). Despite a relatively stable U.S. economy, global growth is slowing, manufacturing remains weak, and structural shifts from energy transition are underway. Rising electric vehicle adoption and improved energy efficiency are flattening oil demand growth. This suggests that even with supply disruptions, oil prices are unlikely to surge significantly unless there is a large-scale, sustained supply shock. Thus, low oil prices are seen as a medium-term trend driven by demand-side structural changes. The Connecticut Association of Energy Marketers notes that increased domestic U.S. crude production is a key factor in keeping prices low. This domestic supply stability provides a crucial buffer against international geopolitical risks, reducing consumer exposure to global conflicts compared to past decades. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts global crude supply in 2026 will exceed demand by at least 3.8 million barrels per day, potentially the largest oversupply in history. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts a drop in Brent crude prices to $55 per barrel in the first quarter of 2026, with prices expected to remain at that low level throughout the year, and a projected annual supply surplus of 2.2 million barrels per day.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 12:09 AM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=a97d16fd-3fa3-4514-902f-1a074994e89a)\n\n**National Gas Prices Fall Again To Multi-Year Lows | OilPrice.com**\nThe national average price of gasoline in the United States has fallen to $2.79 per gallon, the lowest level since 2021, a 4-cent drop from the previous week. Prices vary significantly by state, with Oklahoma at $2.366 per gallon and California at $4.469 per gallon. Diesel prices have declined even more sharply, averaging $3.671 per gallon, down 5.1 cents week-over-week. According to GasBuddy's Patrick De Haan, gas prices continued to drop in most states, though some 'price-cycling' states experienced temporary spikes to restore margins. With the national average at multi-year lows, prices are expected to remain relatively low into the new year, barring major disruptions. Global oil markets are experiencing volatility due to conflicting forces: geopolitical tensions (Russia sanctions, Middle East instability) pushing prices up, and concerns over economic slowdown and oversupply (weaker Chinese demand, OPEC+ returning barrels) pulling them down. Investors are also anticipating U.S. interest rate cuts, which could boost demand. Brent crude for February delivery traded at $62.79 per barrel, down 1.51%, while WTI crude for January delivery fell 1.53% to $59.12 per barrel. UBS commodities analyst Giovanni Staunovo noted that oil prices remain range-bound due to ongoing Ukraine-Russia peace negotiations and limited onshore inventory builds, with energy agencies expected to release a report likely to include upward revisions to demand forecasts, driven by stronger U.S. oil demand growth.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 08, 2025 08:30 PM\nSource:[OilPrice.com](https://oilprice.com/Latest-Energy-News/World-News/National-Gas-Prices-Fall-Again-To-Multi-Year-Lows.html)\n\n**National Gas Prices Sink Below $3/Gallon For First Time Since 2021**\nThe national average price of gasoline in the United States dropped below $3 per gallon for the first time since May 2021, reaching $2.83 per gallon as of December 3, 2025, according to GasBuddy. This represents a 6.9-cent decrease from one month prior and a 5.4-cent drop compared to the same period a year earlier. Prices vary significantly by state, with Oklahoma reporting a low of $2.409 per gallon and California at a high of $4.560 per gallon. A handful of gas stations are offering fuel under $2 per gallon. Diesel prices also declined, with the national average at $3.72 per gallon, down 5.5 cents from one week prior. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, noted that nearly every state saw falling gas prices leading into Thanksgiving, with the national average dipping below $3 for several consecutive days, reaching a low of $2.95 per gallon over the weekend. Oil prices remain low: Brent crude for February delivery traded at $63.07 per barrel, up 1.07% on the day but nearly $2 lower than a month ago, while WTI crude rose 1.1% to $59.19 per barrel. U.S. energy inventories show mixed trends: crude oil inventories rose by 2.8 million barrels but remain 4% below the seasonal average; gasoline inventories increased by 2.5 million barrels but are 3% below the five-year average; distillate inventories rose by 1.1 million barrels but are 5% below the seasonal average. Despite the drop in fuel prices, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts a continued upward trend in electricity and natural gas prices through at least 2026, with residential electricity prices projected to rise 5.8% between August 2024 and August 2025, and moderate increases expected in 2025 and 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 03, 2025 06:56 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, described the decline as 'remarkable' in both speed and breadth, noting that every state has seen relief at the pump over the past week. Several dozen gas stations in Oklahoma, Colorado, and Texas are already selling fuel for $1.99 per gallon or less. The price drop is driven by easing crude oil prices, increased supply from OPEC+, record U.S. oil production, and strong refinery output, which have boosted gasoline inventories despite typical winter demand declines. De Haan projected that the national average could remain below $3 per gallon for more than four weeks and potentially through the winter, with prices expected to begin their usual rise in mid-February. He also noted that the outlook for favorable fuel prices in 2026 is improving.

Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, stated, 'We haven't seen the national average fall this low in over four years, and the speed and breadth of the decline are remarkable.' The price drop is attributed to easing crude oil costs, strong refinery utilization rates, rising gasoline inventories, and reduced seasonal demand. GasBuddy also reported dozens of stations in Oklahoma, Colorado, and Texas selling gasoline for $1.99 per gallon or less. De Haan projected that the national average may spend more time below $3 per gallon than above it over the next four weeks, potentially continuing into winter before prices begin their typical rise in mid-February. Looking ahead, he noted that 'the outlook for another friendly year for motorists is strengthening' as the country approaches 2026.

However, in a significant development, as many as 28 states\u2014primarily in the Midwest and Gulf Coast\u2014have sustained average gasoline prices below $3.00 per gallon, with Oklahoma recording the lowest average at $2.43 per gallon, the lowest since February 2021. This decline is attributed to lower crude oil prices, which have dropped by about 17% year to date, with U.S. benchmark WTI Crude futures falling below $60 per barrel. Additionally, the completion of autumn refinery maintenance, the use of cheaper winter fuel blends, and weaker-than-expected seasonal demand despite a record 81.8 million Americans expected to travel over Thanksgiving (with 73 million driving\u2014nearly 90% of travelers and 1.3 million more than last year) have contributed to the downward trend. AAA noted that despite the holiday travel surge, overall demand remains low, helping keep prices stable. GasBuddy\u2019s Patrick De Haan predicted further price declines due to global oversupply and ongoing peace talks in Ukraine.

Peace talks in Ukraine and rising OPEC output are also expected to keep prices low. Patrick De Haan of GasBuddy projected that more stations in low-cost states like Texas and Mississippi could soon follow, with further declines anticipated before the typical spring rebound in 2026.
