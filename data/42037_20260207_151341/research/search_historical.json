While both fuel types can be correlated due to shared factors (crude oil costs, refining capacity, regional distribution), this article does not provide direct information about regular gasoline prices for February 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=67124\">\n## Summary of Article: Record Natural Gas Stock Withdrawals During Week Ending January 30, 2026\n\n**Source:** U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA)  \n**Date:** February 05, 2026\n\n### Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Record withdrawal:** Working natural gas stocks fell 360 billion cubic feet (Bcf) in the Lower 48 states for the week ending January 30, 2026\u2014the largest weekly net withdrawal in the history of the Weekly Natural Gas Storage Report.\n\n2. **Comparison to average:** The withdrawal exceeded the five-year average for the same week by 89% (170 Bcf).\n\n3. **Current stock levels:** Working gas stocks are now 1.1% below the five-year average for this time of year.\n\n4. **Increased heating demand:** Natural gas consumption in residential and commercial sectors January 23\u201326 averaged 29% higher, or 13.9 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d) more than the five-year average for those days (according to Bloomberg L.P.).\n\n5. **Price impacts:** The U.S. benchmark natural gas spot price at the Henry Hub rose to $9.03 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) on January 28, which was:\n   - $4.05/MMBtu higher than the week-earlier price\n   - $5.60/MMBtu higher than the year-earlier price\n\n### Contributing Factors:\n\n- **Winter Storm Fern:** A massive winter storm brought extreme cold, heavy snow, and ice across a large portion of the Lower 48 states from New Mexico to New England (according to NOAA).\n\n- **Production curtailments:** Extreme cold reduced natural gas production due to equipment freeze-offs and shut-ins. Temperatures along the U.S. Gulf Coast averaged below freezing on January 25, contributing to the largest shut-in reported during the week.\n\n### Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\nWhile this article focuses on natural gas rather than gasoline prices, natural gas prices can have indirect effects on gasoline prices through energy market dynamics and production costs. The severe weather event in late January 2026 and its impact on energy markets provides context for the energy situation leading into February 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve EIA weekly regular gasoline prices January 2026 and historical February averages; compute mean, stdev for last 10 Februaries; summarise trend\nThe Energy Information Administration (EIA) publishes two closely-related data sets that answer the question:\n\n1. Weekly U.S. regular gasoline retail price \u2013 series PET.EMM_EPMR_PTE_NUS_DPG, released every Monday in the \u201cGasoline and Diesel Fuel Update\u201d.\n2. Monthly U.S. regular gasoline retail price \u2013 the same series, but aggregated to monthly frequency and published on the \u201cU.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices\u201d page.\n\nA. Weekly observations for January 2026  \nThe most recent \u201cGasoline and Diesel Fuel Update\u201d (release date 3 Feb 2026) lists the national average for regular gasoline for the last two Mondays in January 2026:  \n\u2022 19 Jan 2026: $2.806 /gal  \n\u2022 26 Jan 2026: $2.853 /gal  (Gasoline and Diesel Fuel Update, 3 Feb 2026)  \n\nThose values come directly from the weekly PET.EMM_EPMR_PTE_NUS_DPG series. Data for the first two Mondays in January (5 Jan and 12 Jan 2026) are not shown in the excerpted table and would have to be pulled from the full weekly file; thus the January set is presently incomplete.\n\nB. Historical February averages  \nThe monthly table for the same series provides national February averages back to 1990. The last ten February values available today are (EIA monthly table, release 3 Feb 2026):\n\nFeb-2016  $1.764  \nFeb-2017  $2.304  \nFeb-2018  $2.587  \nFeb-2019  $2.309  \nFeb-2020  $2.442  \nFeb-2021  $2.501  \nFeb-2022  $3.517  \nFeb-2023  $3.389  \nFeb-2024  $3.212  \nFeb-2025  $3.121  \n\n(The February-2026 monthly average is not yet published because the month is still in progress.)\n\nC. Mean and standard deviation, last 10 Februaries (2016-2025)  \n\u2022 Mean = (\u03a3 values) / 10  = $2.71 per gallon  \n\u2022 Population standard deviation = \u221a[(\u03a3 (x\u2013mean)\u00b2)/10] \u2248 $0.54 per gallon  \n(If a sample standard deviation is preferred, divide by 9 instead of 10; that yields \u2248 $0.57.)\n\nD. Trend analysis  \n\u2022 2016-2020: February prices hovered in the mid-$1.75\u2013$2.60 range, rising slowly from the post-2014 oil-price crash.  \n\u2022 2021: A step-up to $2.50 as demand recovered from the pandemic and crude prices firmed.  \n\u2022 2022: A sharp jump to $3.52 \u2013 the highest February on record \u2013 driven by the post-COVID demand surge and the crude-oil price shock following the Russia-Ukraine conflict.  \n\u2022 2023-2025: Gradual retreat, but February prices remain above every pre-2021 February. The 2025 average of $3.12 is still about $0.60 higher than the 2016-2020 band, illustrating a new, higher post-pandemic plateau.  \n\u2022 Forward look: EIA\u2019s January-2026 Short-Term Energy Outlook projects a full-year 2026 average regular gasoline price of about $2.92 /gal, implying that February-2026 may continue to track slightly below recent Februarys but well above the pre-2021 era (Rigzone summary of January-2026 STEO).\n\nE. Remaining information gaps  \n1. The first two weekly observations for January 2026 (5 Jan and 12 Jan) are missing from the material provided. Retrieving them would allow calculation of a complete January weekly average.  \n2. The February-2026 monthly average will not be available until EIA publishes the February update in early March 2026.  \n3. If regional detail is desired, the Update table also contains the five PADD averages, but they were not requested.\n\nIf the missing January weeks are needed now, the full weekly CSV (PET.EMM_EPMR_PTE_NUS_DPG, weekly frequency) can be queried directly from the EIA site or via FRED once an API key is configured.\n\nNo additional searches are required to satisfy the original query beyond obtaining those two missing January-2026 points, should they be needed.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData query=\"EMM_EPMP_PTE_NUS_DPG monthly gasoline\">\nError: FRED_API_KEY not configured.\n</FREDData>\n"
