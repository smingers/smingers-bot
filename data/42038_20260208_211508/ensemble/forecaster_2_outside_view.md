## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Month-to-month changes in Ifo Index (all periods)**: Too broad, includes structural breaks and different economic regimes

2. **Recent stabilization period (Aug 2025 - Jan 2026)**: 6-month window showing range 87.60-88.80, mean ≈88.0. Highly relevant but small sample.

3. **Post-pandemic recovery period (2023-2026)**: Captures recent economic dynamics including energy crisis aftermath, inflation normalization. Range approximately 84.9-92.9.

4. **Year-over-year February comparisons**: Feb 2024 (85.90), Feb 2025 (85.30). Shows February-specific patterns.

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: Combination of recent 6-month trend (showing stabilization around 87-88 range) contextualized by the broader 2023-2026 recovery period. This captures both short-term momentum and realistic bounds.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 15 days from now (February 8 to February 23, 2026 release date)

**Historical Patterns:**
- Recent 6-month trend: Relatively stable, ranging 87.60-88.80
- Month-to-month changes: YCharts notes average monthly change magnitude is historically ~1.1 points
- January to February historical: Feb 2024 (85.90) vs Jan 2024 (85.60) = +0.30; Feb 2025 (85.30) vs Jan 2025 (85.40) = -0.10
- Current position: Jan 2026 at 87.60, unchanged from December, suggesting consolidation

**Seasonal Considerations**: The index is seasonally adjusted, reducing but not eliminating seasonal effects.

## (d) Justification

The February 2026 Ifo Business Climate Index will be measured during a period of:

1. **Recent Stabilization**: The index has plateaued at 87.60 for two consecutive months (Dec 2025-Jan 2026) after declining from peaks around 88.80 in August 2025.

2. **Macro Context**: Expert forecasts (BNP Paribas) project gradual German recovery in 2026 supported by fiscal stimulus, but with Q1 likely still showing modest growth. This suggests business sentiment should remain stable-to-slightly-improving rather than dramatically changing.

3. **Status Quo Baseline**: With January at 87.60 and no dramatic economic shocks reported in early February 2026, the most likely outcome is continuation near current levels (87-88 range).

4. **Historical Volatility**: Recent period (2023-2026) shows the index can range from 84.9 to 92.9, but month-to-month moves are typically modest (1-2 points).

5. **Directional Factors**:
   - Positive: Fiscal stimulus rolling out, manufacturing sector improving
   - Negative: Services sector weakness, trade tensions with China/US
   - Neutral: Stabilized inflation, gradual recovery expectations

The balance of evidence suggests February 2026 will likely fall in the 86-89 range, centered around 87.5-88.0, representing continuation of the recent stabilization with slight upside bias from improving fundamentals.

Outside view calibration:

My baseline prediction centers on the recent 87.60 level with modest variation:

- **Central tendency (40th-60th percentiles)**: Should capture the most likely range of 87.0-88.5, reflecting either slight decline, stability, or modest improvement from January's 87.60.

- **10th percentile**: Must account for downside risk (renewed pessimism, negative shock). Recent low was 84.90 (Dec 2024). A significant deterioration could push to 85-86 range, but going below 85 would require substantial negative news. Set at 85.5 to allow for meaningful downside while respecting recent floor.

- **90th percentile**: Must account for upside surprise (stronger-than-expected recovery signals, fiscal optimism). Recent 6-month peak was 88.80. A strong positive surprise could reach 89-90 range. Historical peak in recent period was 92.90 (April 2023), but reaching that would require dramatic improvement. Set at 89.5 to allow meaningful upside while respecting that dramatic jumps are rare month-to-month.

- **Distribution shape**: Slight positive skew reflecting expert views of gradual recovery, but bounded by recent trading range reality.

- **Tail risks**: The 10-90 range of 85.5-89.5 (4-point spread) is reasonable given historical monthly volatility averages ~1.1 points but can occasionally be larger during transitions.
