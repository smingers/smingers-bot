Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. ifo Institute January 26, 2026 release (primary, factual): shows the latest all-Germany index at 87.6, details sector splits. Very high quality.  
2. Neue Zürcher Zeitung 08 Feb 2026 (reliable newspaper, factual + expert quotes): confirms strong December industrial orders (+7.8 % m/m) and exports (+4.0 %), but also many opinions about structural headwinds. Good quality, but only indirectly linked to February mood.  
3. ifo Employment Barometer January 2026 (primary, factual): barometer up to 93.4 – first improvement in months. Moderate signal of labour-market optimism.  
4. Sector notes (ifo automotive, chemical, VDMA machinery – all Feb 02-04 2026): primary survey data, show slight sentiment improvements in industry but continued weakness in energy-intensive chemicals and services. Good quality, near-contemporaneous.  
5. Macro commentary from BNP Paribas (Sep 2025) and other banks (Jan 2026 press quotes): professional forecasts; useful for direction but dated. Moderate quality opinions.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Latest headline index = 87.6 and has moved ≤0.4 pt each of the last three releases → high persistence.  
Moderate evidence  
• Surge in industrial orders & exports (Destatis, Dec data) and higher employment barometer → plausible small upside to expectations.  
• Manufacturing sub-index up sharply in January → momentum may carry into February.  
Weak evidence  
• Train-driver strike, weather folklore, equity-market chatter – anecdotal, little direct bearing.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in ~16-20 days.  One-month horizon implies limited volatility; halving the horizon (forecasting mid-February flash) would narrow the distribution slightly; doubling (to two months) would widen tails by ~30 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Base-rate (outside view) median: 87.6 with σ≈1.1 pt; 80 % band 84.5–89.6.  
Inside view adjustments:  
+0.4 pt for strong December industrial orders & better manufacturing mood.  
+0.2 pt for uptick in employment barometer.  
-0.2 pt for continued service-sector softness and political/energy cost drag.  
Net +0.4 pt shift: new central estimate ≈88.0.  Tails kept fat enough for a surprise shock or upside pop.

Distribution calibration
I map these considerations onto a discrete percentile grid:

Percentile 10: 85.0  
Percentile 20: 86.0  
Percentile 40: 87.5  
Percentile 60: 88.5  
Percentile 80: 89.5  
Percentile 90: 91.0  

Implied median (≈50th) ~88.0, mean ~88.1 – consistent with “slight improvement-but-no-breakthrough” narrative.

Checklist:  
1. Target variable: all-Germany ifo Business Climate Index, February 2026, points.  
2. Outside-view distribution stated and used.  
3. Consistency check: median 88.0; mean 88.1; fits justification.  
4. Key evidence: (i) Jan headline 87.6 steady, (ii) big jump in Dec industrial orders, (iii) manufacturing sub-index up, (iv) employment barometer higher, (v) services still weak.  
5. Blind-spot: sharp negative shock (e.g., abrupt energy-price spike) before survey – would push outcome below 85.  
6. Status-quo bias considered; only small upward nudge taken.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, units = points, within 70-100 upper bound.
