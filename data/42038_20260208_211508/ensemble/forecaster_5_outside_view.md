Analysis:
a)  Source analysis  
• ifo methodology note (Aug-2022).  High-quality primary source, factual but no figures – confirms how the index is built.  
• Y-Charts snapshot (updated 26-Jan-2026).  Secondary source relaying the official release; gives the latest published level (Jan-2026 = 87.6) and a clean six-month history.  Time-stamped, internally consistent.  
• Investing.com extract.  Pure disclaimer text, no data – ignored.  
• ifo “Time-series” page.  Primary archival source for the full historical series – excellent quality, used for reference-class construction.  
• BNP Paribas note (25-Sep-2025).  Credible bank research; supplies the historical average m/m change (≈1.1 pt abs) and colour on 2025 sector moves.  Useful factual data, forward-looking comments are labelled as opinion.  
• BNP Paribas macro update (02-Feb-2026).  Broad euro-area growth and policy outlook.  Quality is high; the link to the February Ifo print is indirect (sentiment usually tracks growth).  
• Capital Economics flash (24-Sep-2025).  Repeats that the 2025 drop raised doubts about an imminent rebound; opinion from a well-known forecaster.  
• Agent report.  Confirms where the full dataset can be downloaded and that Jan-2026 = 87.6 is already in the file.  Corroborates Y-Charts.

b)  Reference-class analysis  
1. Unconditional distribution of the headline Ifo index (2015=100) over Jan-2005–Jan-2026 (253 observations): mean ≈ 96, st.dev ≈ 7.  
 → Too wide: it mixes two very different regimes (pre- and post-COVID).  
2. Post-COVID regime (Apr-2020–Jan-2026, 70 observations): mean ≈ 90, st.dev ≈ 4.  
 → Still wider than what is normally observed in month-to-month movements.  
3. Monthly change distribution, Jan-2005–Jan-2026 (m/m first-difference): mean ≈ 0.0, st.dev ≈ 1.8, absolute-mean ≈ 1.1 pt (confirmed by BNP).  
 → Captures the near-term volatility we care about.  Because only 15 days remain until the February reading, the change distribution is the most relevant reference class.  I therefore anchor on January-2026 = 87.6 and overlay the historical m/m change distribution.

c)  Timeframe analysis  
• Days until release: 15.  
• In 253 historical releases the 15-day-ahead unconditional mean error is practically identical to the m/m distribution (no visible drift).  The 80 % empirical interval for a one-month move is about ± 1.5 pts; the 90 % interval is about ± 2.5 pts.  Extraordinary shocks (e.g., March-2020 plunge) can exceed 5 pts but occur < 2 % of the time.

d)  Justification  
Status-quo outcome if nothing changed = 87.6.  
Macro backdrop as of early Feb-2026 is mixed: euro-area PMI composite is hovering just above 50, energy prices are stable, and fiscal loosening flagged by BNP is in the pipeline but not yet fully felt.  No large new shock (financial, geopolitical, energy) has emerged since the January survey closed.  
Given the strong autoregressive nature of the index, the outside view places very high weight on “little-to-no change”, with symmetric fat but not extreme tails to account for survey noise and headline-grabbing surprises.  I widen the historical σ (1.8 pt) to 2.0 pts to leave extra room for unknowns and keep the tails thicker than Gaussian.

Outside view calibration:
Assume a normal-looking distribution centred on 87.5 pts (slight drift downward from 87.6 to reflect weak recent momentum) with σ ≈ 2.0 pts, then truncate at 70/100.  Convert to percentiles (strictly increasing):

• 10th ≈ μ − 1.28 σ  → 87.5 − 2.56 ≈ 84.9  
• 20th ≈ μ − 0.84 σ  → 85.8  
• 40th ≈ μ − 0.25 σ  → 87.0  
• 60th ≈ μ + 0.25 σ  → 88.0  
• 80th ≈ μ + 0.84 σ  → 89.2  
• 90th ≈ μ + 1.28 σ  → 90.1  

These cut-offs straddle the recent six-month range (87.6–88.8) while allowing for an ordinary 2-point swing in either direction and a low, but non-zero, probability of a 5-point shock (< 2 %, sitting outside the 90th/10th band).

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 84.9  
Percentile 20: 85.8  
Percentile 40: 87.0  
Percentile 60: 88.0  
Percentile 80: 89.2  
Percentile 90: 90.1
