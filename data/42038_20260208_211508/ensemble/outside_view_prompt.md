IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-08. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-08 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

The lower bound is 70.0 and the upper bound is 100.0.
The lower bound is OPEN (outcome can be below 70.0), but the upper bound is CLOSED (outcome cannot exceed 100.0). Your lower percentiles may extend below the lower bound if evidence supports it.

## Summary of Article: "ifo Business Climate Index for Germany"

**Date:** August 03, 2022  
**Source:** ifo Institute

### Key Methodological Facts:

1. **Survey Basis:**
   - Based on approximately 9,000 monthly survey responses
   - Covers firms in: manufacturing, service sector, construction, wholesaling, and retailing
   - Firms assess current business situation ("good", "satisfactorily", or "poor") and six-month expectations ("more favourable", "unchanged", or "more unfavourable")

2. **Calculation Method:**
   - Balance value for current situation = percentage of "good" responses minus percentage of "poor" responses
   - Balance value for expectations = percentage of "more favourable" minus "more unfavourable" responses
   - "Satisfactory" and "unchanged" responses are considered neutral and don't affect calculations
   - Business Climate Index = mean of the situation balance and expectations balance
   - Balance values can range from -100 to +100

3. **Index Conversion:**
   - To calculate index values: balances are increased by 200 and normalized to the average of a base year (currently 2015)

4. **Seasonal Adjustment:**
   - Uses X-13 ARIMA-SEATS procedure (developed by U.S. Bureau of the Census)
   - Complies with international standards
   - Time series with significant trading-day effects are additionally adjusted for working-day effects

5. **Indicator Status:**
   - Described as "a widely observed early indicator for economic development in Germany"
   - "A much considered indicator for the economic evolution in Germany"

### Note:
This article is primarily a methodological description of how the ifo Business Climate Index is calculated and does not contain recent index values, forecasts, or projections for February 2026. It provides background information on the indicator's construction rather than current economic data or expert opinions about future values.

## Key Facts and Information:

1. **September 2025 Index Movement:** The German Ifo Business Climate Index (BCI) fell in September 2025.

2. **Contrast with Other Indicators:** This decline contrasts with a significant improvement in the Composite PMI during the same period.

3. **Economic Recovery Outlook:** 
   - The fall in the Ifo BCI raises doubts about whether the German economy is "finally turning a corner"

<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve monthly Ifo Business Climate Index values for Germany from January 2005 through January 2026 and calculate mean, median, and 10th–90th percentiles.
The goal remains unchanged: assemble the complete monthly, seasonally-adjusted headline Ifo Business Climate Index for Germany covering January 2005 through January 2026 (253 observations) and then compute mean, median and the 10th–90th percentile band for that window.

1. Relevance of the new search results  
   • All three pages returned in the latest round (Tutorialspoint article on SQL AND/OR, SQL in the Wild blog post on “catch-all” queries, W3Schools note on SQL ANY/ALL) deal exclusively with SQL syntax and query optimisation and contain no macro-economic data whatsoever (Tutorialspoint; SQL in the Wild; W3Schools).  
   • Consequently, they do not add to our knowledge of where or how to obtain the Ifo series, nor do they alter the statistical task. They can be ignored for the purposes of the present data collection.

2. Current evidence on data availability (recap of earlier verified sources)  
   • Primary source—ifo Institute “Zeitreihen” repository: the Excel workbook gsk-d-2601.xlsx (naming convention: gsk-d-YYMM.xlsx) delivers the Business Climate Index with 2015 = 100, seasonally adjusted, from January 1991 up to and including January 2026. The landing page explicitly lists this file among the freely downloadable series and permits research use.  
   • Secondary source—FRED: series ID BSCICP03DEM665S provides the identical headline index. A key-less CSV call via https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=BSCICP03DEM665S normally returns all released observations. If FRED lags by one release, the single missing value (Jan 2026 = 87.6, confirmed below) can be appended manually.  
   • Independent confirmation of the January 2026 observation: YCharts table “Germany Ifo Business Climate Index (I:GIBCI)” lists 87.6 for the period “January 31 2026”, with a last-updated stamp of 26 Jan 2026 04:31 EST, demonstrating that the ifo Institute has already disseminated that data point.

3. What is already secured  
   • Public, no-cost access to the full monthly vector (1991-present) is guaranteed by at least one of the above paths.  
   • Licensing terms allow statistical processing and publication of derived statistics.  
   • The number of rows required (Jan 2005–Jan 2026) is fully covered by the existing files.

4. Computational steps once the file is downloaded  
   • Sub-select the 253-row slice from 2005-01 through 2026-01.  
   • Mean: in Excel use AVERAGE(range) or, in R/Python, mean(x).  
   • Median: MEDIAN(range) or median(x).  
   • 10th and 90th percentiles: PERCENTILE.EXC(range,0.10) and PERCENTILE.EXC(range,0.90) in Excel; in R quantile(x, c(0.10,0.90), type = 6); in Python numpy.quantile(x,[0.10,0.90], method="linear").  
   • Round or report with the precision customary for the index (one decimal).

5. Remaining information gap  
   • Neither the newly supplied SQL pages nor the earlier search snippets display the actual numeric observations in-line. The sole action still outstanding is the mechanical download of either the Excel or the FRED CSV file and the execution of four elementary descriptive-statistics commands. Until that step is performed locally, the numeric answers (mean, median, percentile values) cannot be quoted.

6. Need for further web searching?  
   • No. The primary and secondary download routes are already known and verified; the January 2026 value is confirmed; and licensing is clear. Additional searching would not change the task, only the hands-on retrieval will. Therefore the research phase can be considered complete.

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
