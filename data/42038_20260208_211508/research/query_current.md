Analysis:
To set a baseline and build a forward-looking view, I need (a) the latest published value (January 2026) from the Ifo Institute, (b) any economist surveys or bank research that give a February expectation, and (c) macro commentary (German PMI readings, order books, energy price developments, ECB policy) that could influence sentiment between the January and February survey periods. News articles or notes published after the January release (29 Jan 2026) up to today (8 Feb 2026) are most relevant because they will discuss initial market expectations for the February print.
