Analysis:
To judge the likely level of the Ifo Business Climate Index in February 2026 I need an outside-view sense of its normal range, recent trend, volatility and macro context. The most useful background is:  
• Full monthly history of the index (especially the last two business cycles and the most recent 12–18 months).  
• Recent releases and commentary (e.g., January 2026 reading, market forecasts for February, economists’ explanations).  
• Any macroeconomic forecasts or leading-indicator composites that correlate with the Ifo index.  
Therefore I will look for: (1) historical data series from the Ifo site or statistical databases; (2) news and analyst pieces published in the last few days with expectations for the upcoming February figure; (3) a machine-curated table of the entire time series for quick descriptive statistics; and (4) comparable series in FRED that can supply long-run context.
