However, recent data from the Federal Statistical Office shows a 7.8% month-on-month increase in industrial orders in December 2025, surpassing all expectations. Exports also rose 4.0% more than anticipated, despite U.S. tariffs and weak demand in China. Analysts interpret this as a potential 'strong impetus' to lift Germany's industry from stagnation, with Michael Holstein of DZ Bank calling it 'the beginning of a self-sustaining recovery.' The European Central Bank\u2019s 2 percentage point rate cut between summer 2024 and summer 2025 and the federal government\u2019s billion-euro infrastructure and defense spending program are seen as key drivers. However, structural challenges remain: high labor and energy costs, excessive bureaucracy, and high taxes continue to depress business and consumer sentiment. The Ifo Business Climate Index stagnated in January after two consecutive declines, and J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer of Commerzbank warns that 'defense contracts alone won't create a recovery.' A letter from Christoph Ahlhaus, head of the Federation of Medium-Sized Enterprises, reveals deep frustration: 64% of companies doubt Chancellor Merz\u2019s promised economic turnaround, and 79% see no genuine government effort. Political fragmentation and broken reform promises reduce the effectiveness of public spending, with the RWI Leibniz Institute estimating that each euro of government expenditure boosts GDP by less than one euro. Without fundamental reforms, the stimulus may only produce a 'weak fire.' Demographic trends further threaten growth: the aging population will outpace net migration, causing labor shortages. The Council of Economic Experts projects Germany\u2019s long-term growth rate will fall from 0.4% to 0.1% by 2030, risking prolonged stagnation. The article questions whether stock markets will anticipate this or follow Paul Samuelson\u2019s observation that they often mispredict economic turning points.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 04:48 PM\nSource:[Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung](https://www.nzz.ch/wirtschaft/mehr-auftraege-mehr-exporte-die-konjunkturdaten-in-deutschland-bessern-sich-kommt-jetzt-der-aufschwung-ld.1924019)\n\n**Economic Forecast: Key Events Across Europe on February 9, 2026**\nThe economic forecast for Monday, February 9, 2026, includes several key events across Europe.

A well-known rule states: 'If February is dry and cold, heat will come soon in March,' suggesting a rapid temperature rise. While the German Weather Service (DWD) confirms that such rules cannot reliably predict weather, they may contain a kernel of truth based on long-term observations. Data from the weather portal donnerwetter.de indicates that if the first week of February is sunnier than average, there is a 70% probability of more frost days in February and March. High-pressure systems at the beginning of February often bring clear skies and prolonged sunny conditions, but this can lead to stronger nighttime cooling, causing temperatures to drop significantly. Another rule from January 31, 'If it freezes on Vigilius, cold will come in March,' aligns with historical weather data, showing a 65% chance of increased frost days in March when January ends cold. These traditions are rooted in agricultural practices and religious customs, with Candlemas historically marking the end of the Christmas season and the return to work after winter. The article notes that while some rules are based on folklore, others have statistical support from long-term meteorological records.

It highlights that the US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates 1\u20132 times, while the European Central Bank (ECB) will likely hold rates steady, and the Bank of Japan may begin monetary normalization, potentially leading to yen appreciation. These divergences are expected to narrow interest rate differentials, particularly impacting USD/JPY, which could range from 146\u2013148 by Q4 2026. The Australian dollar (AUD) is projected to strengthen due to robust global demand for commodities like iron ore and copper, along with a pro-cyclical growth environment. EUR/USD may rise due to Germany\u2019s fiscal stimulus, though French political instability and a widening French-German bond spread (86 basis points) pose risks. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is forecast to decline to the mid-90s by year-end, pressured by Fed rate cuts and reduced safe-haven appeal. Market sentiment, support/resistance levels, and geopolitical tensions are identified as critical factors influencing currency movements. Traders are advised to monitor central bank announcements, economic indicators, and yield curve shifts to capitalize on opportunities in a volatile environment.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 12:00 PM\nSource:[TradersDNA](https://www.tradersdna.com/forex-updates-news/)\n\n**Farmers' Calendar Predicts Snowstorm Heading for Germany in February**\nAccording to the predictions of the 100-year-old Farmers' Calendar, Germany is expected to face not only 'very severe cold' but also a snowstorm in February 2026.

The index entered a sideways correction phase in June 2025 after a notable rally, maintaining support above 23,500 points despite short-term downward pressure. A strong market sentiment was confirmed during the year-end recovery, enabling the DAX to reach a new all-time high of 25,507 points before losing momentum. In the previous week, trading remained near the previous year's high, with the closing price still within reach. This could lead to a further easing of tension at the start of the new week, potentially trending toward the previous week's high. Expected daily range for Monday: 24,560 to 25,010. Key resistance levels: 24,771; 25,098 (previous week's high); 25,507. Key support levels: 24,272 (previous week's low); 23,476. For Tuesday, if the recovery continues, focus may shift to the 25,000 mark; otherwise, targets could fall to 24,000. Expected daily range: 24,690 to 25,070 or 24,410 to 24,780. For the full week, the DAX remained within the trading range formed since June, briefly breaking out but returning to the 50-day moving average. The battle for the previous year's high is expected to continue, with a clear directional impulse needed to determine the next move. Expected weekly range: 24,150 to 25,180. For the following week, the market's ability to stabilize above 24,500 points will depend on developments in the prior week; if correction pressure increases, the index could target the 23,500 range.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 07, 2026 02:21 PM\nSource:[Investing.com Deutsch](https://de.investing.com/analysis/dax-chartanalyse--prognosen-fur-die-neue-woche-07-in-2026-200505934)\n\n**TecDAX Falls Into Negative Territory Amid Mixed Performance in German Tech Stocks**\nOn Friday, February 6, 2026, the TecDAX declined slightly, closing at 3,621.39 points, a decrease of -0.18% compared to the previous day's closing level of 3,628.05 points.

The increase was driven by improved business expectations, which rose by 2.8 points, while the current situation was assessed 2.5 points more negatively than in December 2025. Ifo expert Anita W\u00f6lfl stated that demand from the Eurozone is acting as a 'supporting force' for the industry. Export expectations surged from -8 to +8.7 points, with internal EU trade identified as the main driver behind this improvement. Companies in the German auto sector also reported a significant improvement in their competitive position within the EU, rising 13.9 points to +15.4 in net terms. However, outside Europe, the competitive outlook deteriorated sharply, falling 13.9 points to -31.3, with W\u00f6lfl noting increasing competitiveness challenges from China and the United States.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 01:38 PM\nSource:[heise online](https://www.heise.de/news/Autoindustrie-Europaeische-Nachfrage-macht-Hoffnung-11165336.html)\n\n**Stable Orders Lift Spirits in Germany's Machine and Plant Engineering Sector**\nThe German machine and plant engineering sector, which experienced three difficult years, is showing signs of recovery, according to the VDMA trade association. In 2025, after years of declines, real (price-adjusted) orders remained flat compared to the previous year, driven primarily by a 7% increase in orders from the Eurozone. In contrast, domestic orders fell by 1%, and non-Eurozone international orders dropped by 2%, partly due to U.S. tariff policies under President Trump. Positive sentiment is growing, especially in key customer industries like automotive, where the Ifo Business Climate Index rose slightly in January due to improved business expectations. The Ifo expert Anita W\u00f6lfl notes that intra-European trade is now the main driver of growth. Although German automakers have lost competitiveness in markets like China and increasingly in the U.S., the machine and plant engineering industry is becoming more optimistic. VDMA Chief Economist Johannes Gernandt states that signs of a bottoming out are strengthening, particularly due to a 3% real increase in orders in the fourth quarter of 2025, driven by international demand, especially from non-Eurozone countries. This upward trend is expected to boost production in 2026, with the VDMA forecasting a real 1% production increase\u2014reversing a 5% decline projected for 2025. The mood has significantly improved: in January, nearly 30% of 962 surveyed companies rated the current situation as good or very good, up from 23% in October. Conversely, only 24% rated the situation as bad or very bad, down from 33%. Looking ahead, about 57% of companies expect nominal revenue growth (including price increases), 29% anticipate stagnation, and less than 15% foresee a decline. Despite this optimism, Gernandt cautions that political support and reforms are needed to sustain the recovery and enhance competitiveness in Germany and Europe.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 11:29 AM\nSource:[webnachrichten.de](https://www.webnachrichten.de/wirtschaft/stabile-auftraege-hellen-stimmung-im-maschinenbau-auf-zr-94153705.html)\n\n**Overview: Economic Trends, Central Banks, and Politics \u2013 February 4, 2026**\nThe Ifo Institute reported a slight improvement in the business climate of Germany's automotive industry in January, rising to -19.6 points from -19.8 in December, though this improvement masked a split: while the European market is thriving, competitiveness in China and the U.S. is declining. In China, a private services sector indicator, the RatingDog China General Services Purchasing Managers Index, rose from 52.0 in December to 52.3 in January, marking the highest level in three months and indicating growth above the 50 threshold. This growth was driven by stronger new business activity, with order inflows accelerating for the first time in three months. Kevin Warsh, a potential Federal Reserve appointee, is expected to push the Fed toward a more rule-based approach, emphasizing price stability and reducing bond purchases, which could increase long-term interest rates and strengthen the U.S. dollar, according to Jeffrey Roach of LPL Financial. Meanwhile, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a funding bill to end a partial government shutdown, with 217 votes in favor and 214 against, and will now begin ten-day negotiations on immigration reform. The bill would fund a major portion of the government through September 30, 2026, pending President Donald Trump\u2019s signature.

However, this modest improvement masks a stark division: while the European market remains strong, competitiveness in China and the United States has sharply declined. Although companies rated their current situation worse than in December, pessimism about future prospects has eased. Ifo industry expert Anita W\u00f6lfl noted that demand from the Eurozone continues to serve as a stabilizing force for the German auto sector. Export expectations surged from -8.0 in December to +8.7 in January, driven by strong intra-European trade. The competitiveness index for the EU rose from 1.5 points in October to +15.4 points in January. In contrast, competitiveness outside Europe plummeted to -31.3 points, down from -17.4 in October. W\u00f6lfl emphasized that Germany\u2019s automotive industry has lost competitiveness in overseas markets since 2024, with the decline particularly pronounced in China and increasingly evident in the U.S. Official trade data support this downward trend in the two largest global markets.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 06:05 AM\nSource:[finanzen.net](https://www.finanzen.net/nachricht/aktien/ifo-geschaeftsklima-in-der-autoindustrie-geringfuegig-verbessert-15460927)\n\n**IHK Konjunkturgespr\u00e4ch 2026: Osthessen Wirtschaft in struktureller Rezession, aber vorsichtiger Optimismus f\u00fcr Deutschland**\nThe IHK Fulda's 7th Konjunkturgespr\u00e4ch and Economic Outlook for 2026 revealed that the regional economy in Osthessen remains in a structurally weak, recessionary state. The current business climate is rated as satisfactory by 59.3% of companies (up from 58.4% in October), with 23.6% reporting a poor situation and 17.1% a good one. Future expectations remain negative: 27.3% anticipate a worse business climate (down from 28.0% in October), while only 8.3% expect improvement (down from 19.2%). A stable outlook is expected by 64.4% (up from 52.8%). The Business Climate Index stands at 87.0 points (down from 89.2 in October), remaining below the 100-point threshold for the fourth consecutive year, signaling persistent economic stagnation. In industry, the index dropped to 79.3 points due to pessimistic outlooks, while the trade sector remains at 91.8 points\u2014both in negative territory. Employment plans show a net decline: 22.9% of firms expect job cuts versus 10.2% planning hiring. In industry, 34.1% expect fewer employees and 12.2% more. Among export-oriented firms, 55.9% expect stable exports, 23.5% growth, and 20.6% decline. The top risks cited are deteriorating economic policy conditions (66.1%), declining domestic demand (62.8%), rising labor costs (58.7%), higher energy and raw material prices (47.1%), and skilled labor shortages (37.2%). Regional banks (Sparkasse Fulda and VR Bank Fulda) foresee a largely sideways trend in 2026, with increased risk management discussions. Prof. Dr. Tobias Knedlik of Hochschule Fulda noted global economic conditions remain stable, projected German growth at around 1%, and emphasized the importance of AI use in education for regional future resilience.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 05:48 PM\nSource:[Osthessen News](https://osthessen-news.de/n11788149/flaute-halt-an-diese-erkenntnisse-bringt-das-ihk-konjunkturgesprach.html)\n\n**Ifo: Business Climate in German Chemical Industry Slightly Improved**\nThe business climate in Germany's energy-intensive chemical industry slightly improved at the start of 2026, according to the Ifo Institute. The business climate index rose to -23.5 points in January from -24.6 points in December. While current conditions worsened, expectations improved: 'The chemical industry is looking slightly less pessimistic about the future, but ongoing business remains weak,' said Ifo industry expert Anna Wolf. Demand stabilized slightly compared to the crisis atmosphere at the end of 2025, and for the first time in months, the order backlog increased. The order book now covers 1.8 months of production, up from 1.4 months in October. Despite this positive signal, companies still rate the overall order backlog at -47.1 points, indicating a very low level. Capacity utilization stood at 72.7%, significantly below the 10-year average of 80.9%. Companies plan to reduce production and further cut staff in the coming months, citing ongoing price pressure and uncertainties in international trade due to potential tariffs. The Ifo Institute reported these findings based on a survey of executives.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 08:21 AM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/ifo-geschaeftsklima-in-der-chemie-industrie-leicht-aufgehellt-ce7e5bdddc8ef526)\n\n**Germany's business climate index stable in January**\nGermany's Ifo Business Climate Index remained stable at 87.6 points in January 2026, unchanged from December 2025, according to the Ifo Institute for Economic Research. The index, based on a survey of approximately 9,000 companies, fell short of market expectations for a rise to 88.3 points. While the overall index was flat, the Ifo Expectations Index declined slightly to 89.5 points from 89.7, and the Current Situation Index edged up to 85.7 points. The Ifo Institute stated that assessments of the current economic situation improved modestly, but expectations were revised downward. 'The German economy is starting the new year with little momentum,' the institute said. Manufacturing showed a significant improvement, with businesses reporting more favorable conditions and less negative outlooks. Construction also saw stronger sentiment due to better current conditions. In trade, the business climate improved as firms rated their situation more positively and expectations became less negative. Conversely, the service sector experienced a decline in business sentiment, with companies reporting a slightly worse current situation and increased pessimism about the future.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 12:02 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/en/economy/germanys-business-climate-index-stable-in-january/3811066)\n\n**Ifo: Business Climate Index in Germany Stagnates at Start of Year**\nThe Ifo Business Climate Index in Germany remained stagnant at 87.6 points in January 2026, failing to meet the average economist expectation of 88.2 points as reported by Bloomberg. While current economic conditions saw a slight improvement, future expectations declined slightly. Ifo Institute President Clemens Fuest stated, 'The German economy begins the new year without momentum.' The Ifo Institute surveys approximately 9,000 companies monthly and considers the index the most important indicator of economic trends in Germany. Senior economist at Commerzbank, J\u00f6rg Kremmer, noted that after two consecutive declines, a recovery in the Ifo index was expected, but its failure to materialize is 'disappointing.' He attributed the lack of recovery to widespread disappointment among firms over the absence of major structural reforms, adding that 'the economy is likely to recover slowly this year.' The German Central Bank forecasts only modest growth in the first quarter, and economists anticipate a 1% GDP growth in 2026, primarily driven by large-scale government spending on infrastructure and defense. However, high U.S. tariffs remain a restraining factor for German industry.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 10:53 AM\nSource:[\u0633\u0643\u0627\u064a \u0646\u064a\u0648\u0632 \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/business/1848699-%D8%A7%D9%95%D9%8A%D9%81%D9%88-%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%88%D8%AF-%D9%85%D9%88%D9%94%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AE-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%94%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85)\n\n**German Business Confidence Falls to Seven-Month Low in December**\nThe sentiment of German business leaders deteriorated in December, falling to its lowest level in seven months, signaling concern to the government whose economic recovery policies have failed to reassure. The Ifo business climate index dropped to 87.6 points in December, a 0.4-point decline from November, which had shown a temporary rebound. Expectations for the next six months weakened significantly, while current conditions remained unchanged. Clemens F\u00fcst, president of Ifo, stated that 'the year ends without any momentum for recovery' for Germany's economy, which experienced two consecutive years of recession in 2023 and 2024 and is expected to nearly stagnate in 2025. Pessimism increased across all sectors, including manufacturing, which faces a fourth consecutive year of decline, and services and trade. Jens-Oliver Niklasch, economist at LBBW, noted that 'the signals coming from Berlin likely play an important role\u2014the government's policies are not delivering on promises and sometimes lag behind reality.' Business circles, especially the industrial lobby, remain dissatisfied with the coalition government led by Friedrich Merz, which began in May. The government has prioritized public infrastructure and defense investments, relaxed debt constraints, and introduced tax and social reforms. Berlin is also awaiting EU approval for a 2026 electricity price reduction benefiting energy-intensive industries. These measures are expected to boost economic activity. Niklasch added that 'most forecasts for 2026 anticipate a recovery, slightly improved by a positive calendar effect.' The German Federal Bank will release a new 2026 economic forecast on Friday, projecting a rebound of 0.7%, compared to 0.9% by the IMF and around 1% by German institutions.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 17, 2025 01:23 PM\nSource:[Boursorama](https://www.boursorama.com/actualite-economique/actualites/le-moral-des-entrepreneurs-allemands-baisse-en-decembre-au-plus-bas-depuis-sept-mois-036459062ae062b9f000f80018aa07dd)\n\n**Germany's Business Confidence Deteriorates by Year-End, Marking a Disappointing Close to 2025**\nThe Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich released the results of its December 2025 German Business Survey, which included responses from approximately 9,000 companies. The Ifo Business Climate Index fell to 87.6 points in December, down from 88.0 points in November, marking the second consecutive monthly decline after a six-month upward trend that had been interrupted in September and resumed in October. The decline was driven by a significant deterioration in business expectations, with the Ifo Expectations Index dropping from 91.6 to 90.5 points, while the Current Assessment Index rose slightly from 85.3 to 85.6 points. Manufacturing sector expectations worsened, with companies reporting declining new orders and plans to reduce production. Construction sector confidence remained low. Retailers expressed dissatisfaction with holiday sales, and outlooks for the first half of 2026 were described as pessimistic. Ifo President Clemens Fuest stated that expectations had 'significantly deteriorated,' noting that businesses are becoming increasingly pessimistic about the first half of 2026, while current conditions remain unchanged. LBBW Bank Economist Jens-Oliver Niklasch described the economic outlook as still 'gloomy' heading into year-end, attributing the renewed drop in confidence to political signals from Berlin, stating that 'politicians are not delivering on promises and sometimes act detached from reality.' Hauck Aufhauser Lampe Privatbank Chief Economist Alexander Kr\u00fcger criticized the lack of a real economic policy, saying that hopes are now tied solely to government spending plans, and warned that without real investment, the impact would be temporary, likening the mood to 'a barley soup instead of a holiday feast.' ING Global Macro Research Head and Germany Chief Economist Carsten Brzeski noted that the Ifo Business Climate Index reached its lowest level since May 2025, stating that '2025 ended with a disappointing Ifo index, just as it began.' He emphasized that after years of denial, policymakers have finally acknowledged the end of good economic times, but doubts remain over structural reforms and creative budgeting. Despite a temporary boost from the U-turn in fiscal stimulus and the new coalition agreement, a new national depression period began in the second half of the year. Brzeski added that only two quarters since late 2022 had seen genuine economic growth, but he noted there is sufficient evidence that Germany's economy will overcome stagnation in 2026.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: December 17, 2025 11:27 AM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/ekonomi/alman-is-dunyasinin-ekonomiye-guveni-yil-sonunda-kotulesti/3773645)\n\n**German IFO Business Climate Index Rises to 88.4 in October, Surpassing Expectations**\nAccording to the IFO Institute, Germany's business climate index rose to 88.4 in October 2025 from 87.7 in September, exceeding the forecast of 88. The current assessment index declined slightly from 85.7 to 85.3, while the expectations index increased from 89.7 to 91.6, reaching its highest level since February 2022. IFO President Clemens Fuest stated that businesses remain hopeful about economic recovery next year but hold a slightly negative view of current operating conditions. In manufacturing, satisfaction with current operations remains low, though expectations have improved. The service sector showed a rebound in sentiment, driven by better assessments of current conditions and reduced pessimism about the future. Retail sector confidence strengthened as expectations became less pessimistic, despite a slightly negative view of current conditions. Meanwhile, construction sector sentiment declined slightly, with the index showing a small drop.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 12:49 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The increase was driven by improved expectations for the coming months, although the current business situation was assessed slightly worse. Ifo President Clemens Fuest stated that German businesses continue to hope for an economic recovery in the coming year. Meanwhile, the S&P Global Purchasing Managers' Index for the private sector rose by 1.8 points to 53.8, marking the fifth consecutive month above the 50-point growth threshold\u2014its highest level in nearly two and a half years. Despite this positive trend, the Bundesbank and Reuters-forecasted economists expect stagnation in GDP growth for the third quarter (July\u2013September 2025), following a 0.3% contraction in the second quarter. Fuest recently warned of a potential economic downturn, calling the situation 'dramatic,' and urged the federal government to present a comprehensive reform package by early 2026, exceeding the scope of the current coalition agreement.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 09:19 AM\nSource:[Handelsblatt](https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/konjunktur/konjunktur-ifo-geschaeftsklima-hellt-sich-auf/100168467.html)\n\n**German Business Sentiment Dips Unexpectedly**\nAccording to the Ifo Institute, the German business climate index fell to 87.7 points in September from 88.9 in August, contrary to expectations of a slight rise. The decline reflects lower satisfaction with current business conditions and more pessimistic expectations, especially in manufacturing, services, transport, logistics, and retail. The index dropped to its lowest level since February in the services sector. New orders fell again, and the optimism seen in investment\u2011goods manufacturers the previous month has faded. In wholesale the index fell, while in retail it rose, and in construction the index rebounded after a prior decline. Overall, firms are less optimistic about the near\u2011term outlook.
