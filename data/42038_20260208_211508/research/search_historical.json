It provides background information on the indicator's construction rather than current economic data or expert opinions about future values.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://ycharts.com/indicators/germany_ifo_business_climate_index\">\n# Summary of Article on Germany Ifo Business Climate Index\n\n## Key Statistics and Facts:\n\n**Current Index Level (January 2026):**\n- **87.60 points** (seasonally adjusted, Index 2015=100)\n- Unchanged from December 2025 (87.60)\n- Up 2.58% from January 2025 (85.40)\n\n**Key Release Information:**\n- Last Updated: January 26, 2026, 04:31 EST\n- **Next Release: February 23, 2026, 04:30 EST** (which will report the February 2026 figure)\n- Frequency: Monthly\n- Source: CESifo Group\n- Average Growth Rate: -0.03%\n\n## Historical Data Context:\n\n**Recent Trend (Last 6 months):**\n- January 2026: 87.60\n- December 2025: 87.60\n- November 2025: 88.00\n- October 2025: 88.40\n- September 2025: 87.70\n- August 2025: 88.80\n\n**Year-over-Year Comparison:**\n- January 2025: 85.40\n- February 2025: 85.30\n- January 2024: 85.60\n- February 2024: 85.90\n\n**Historical Range (from data provided):**\n- Recent peak: 92.90 (April 2023)\n- Recent low: 84.90 (December 2024)\n\n## Related German Economic Indicators (as of article date):\n- Germany Real GDP YoY: 0.30%\n- Germany Unemployment Rate: 6.60%\n- ZEW Indicator of Economic Sentiment for Germany: 59.60\n\n---\n\n*Note: This article provides historical data and the current January 2026 value.

Relevance of the new search results  \n   \u2022 All three pages returned in the latest round (Tutorialspoint article on SQL AND/OR, SQL in the Wild blog post on \u201ccatch-all\u201d queries, W3Schools note on SQL ANY/ALL) deal exclusively with SQL syntax and query optimisation and contain no macro-economic data whatsoever (Tutorialspoint; SQL in the Wild; W3Schools).  \n   \u2022 Consequently, they do not add to our knowledge of where or how to obtain the Ifo series, nor do they alter the statistical task. They can be ignored for the purposes of the present data collection.\n\n2. Current evidence on data availability (recap of earlier verified sources)  \n   \u2022 Primary source\u2014ifo Institute \u201cZeitreihen\u201d repository: the Excel workbook gsk-d-2601.xlsx (naming convention: gsk-d-YYMM.xlsx) delivers the Business Climate Index with 2015 = 100, seasonally adjusted, from January 1991 up to and including January 2026. The landing page explicitly lists this file among the freely downloadable series and permits research use.  \n   \u2022 Secondary source\u2014FRED: series ID BSCICP03DEM665S provides the identical headline index. A key-less CSV call via https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=BSCICP03DEM665S normally returns all released observations. If FRED lags by one release, the single missing value (Jan 2026 = 87.6, confirmed below) can be appended manually.  \n   \u2022 Independent confirmation of the January 2026 observation: YCharts table \u201cGermany Ifo Business Climate Index (I:GIBCI)\u201d lists 87.6 for the period \u201cJanuary 31 2026\u201d, with a last-updated stamp of 26 Jan 2026 04:31 EST, demonstrating that the ifo Institute has already disseminated that data point.\n\n3. What is already secured  \n   \u2022 Public, no-cost access to the full monthly vector (1991-present) is guaranteed by at least one of the above paths.  \n   \u2022 Licensing terms allow statistical processing and publication of derived statistics.  \n   \u2022 The number of rows required (Jan 2005\u2013Jan 2026) is fully covered by the existing files.\n\n4. Computational steps once the file is downloaded  \n   \u2022 Sub-select the 253-row slice from 2005-01 through 2026-01.  \n   \u2022 Mean: in Excel use AVERAGE(range) or, in R/Python, mean(x).  \n   \u2022 Median: MEDIAN(range) or median(x).  \n   \u2022 10th and 90th percentiles: PERCENTILE.EXC(range,0.10) and PERCENTILE.EXC(range,0.90) in Excel; in R quantile(x, c(0.10,0.90), type = 6); in Python numpy.quantile(x,[0.10,0.90], method=\"linear\").  \n   \u2022 Round or report with the precision customary for the index (one decimal).\n\n5. Remaining information gap  \n   \u2022 Neither the newly supplied SQL pages nor the earlier search snippets display the actual numeric observations in-line. The sole action still outstanding is the mechanical download of either the Excel or the FRED CSV file and the execution of four elementary descriptive-statistics commands. Until that step is performed locally, the numeric answers (mean, median, percentile values) cannot be quoted.\n\n6. Need for further web searching?  \n   \u2022 No. The primary and secondary download routes are already known and verified; the January 2026 value is confirmed; and licensing is clear. Additional searching would not change the task, only the hands-on retrieval will. Therefore the research phase can be considered complete.\n\nUse the following verification checklist at the end of your response  \n1. Correct formatting for analysis (Analysis: [your analysis])?  \n2. Correct formatting for search queries (</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData query=\"Business Climate Indicator Germany\">\nError: FRED_API_KEY not configured.\n</FREDData>\n"
