Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**FRED Data (DFEDTARU)**: Primary authoritative source showing the current upper bound at 3.75% as of February 8, 2026. This is the official resolution source. Quality: Highest reliability.

**BlackRock (December 2025)**: Karen Veraa-Perry forecasts Fed will pause early 2026, then cut 1-2 times after new Fed Chair takes seat (Powell's term expires May 15, 2026), targeting 3.00-3.25% by end of forecast period. This is an expert opinion from a major asset manager. Quality: High, but represents one institutional view.

**Goldman Sachs**: Forecasts terminal rate of 3.00-3.25%, with cuts expected in March and June 2026. Jan Hatzius (Chief Economist) notes downside risks appear more significant than upside inflation risks. Quality: High credibility expert opinion.

**Investopedia (February 9, 2026)**: Provides current Fed officials' views:
- **Jerome Powell**: Says current rate may be "loosely neutral" or "somewhat restrictive," Fed is "well-positioned to watch"
- **Alberto Musalem** (St. Louis Fed): Believes 3.5-3.75% "is neutral," would be "unadvisable to lower into accommodative territory"
- **Raphael Bostic** (Atlanta Fed): Neutral is "one or two rate cuts away," penciled in zero cuts for 2026
- **Chris Waller**: Dissented to cut, believes rates "should be closer to neutral" (3%)

Quality: Excellent - direct quotes from named FOMC participants as of today's date.

**Agent Report**: Comprehensive history showing:
- Peak of 5.50% in July 2023
- Current 3.75% reached December 10, 2025
- January 28, 2026 meeting: Held at 3.75% with 2 dissenters favoring cuts
- December guidance: "One additional cut by middle of next year" baseline
- January statement: Upgraded labor market language (hawkish tilt), removed "downside risks to employment"

Quality: Excellent synthesis of official Fed communications.

**Trading Economics & Kiplinger**: Provide current rate confirmation but no forward-looking analysis of value.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Fed rate changes over 2-month periods during easing cycles**
- Suitability: Moderate. We're 51 days from resolution (Feb 9 to Mar 31). However, the Fed typically moves at scheduled meetings, and there's only one scheduled meeting before March 31 (March 18-19, 2026).

**Reference Class 2: Fed policy during "near-neutral" periods with data-dependent stance**
- Suitability: High. Current situation matches: Fed believes it's near neutral, has shifted to cautious/data-dependent mode, and recent statements show increased hawkishness (upgraded growth/employment language, removed downside employment risks).

**Reference Class 3: Fed behavior following dissents and divided votes**
- Suitability: Moderate-High. December's 9-3 vote was most divided since 2019. January had 2 dissenters favoring cuts. Historical pattern: Fed tends to pause after divided votes to build consensus.

**Best Reference Class**: Fed policy during "near-neutral" periods with data-dependent stance, as this captures the current regime most accurately.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeframe**: 51 days (February 9 to March 31, 2026)

**Scheduled FOMC Meeting**: March 18-19, 2026 (12 days before resolution date)

**Historical patterns over similar 2-month periods**:
- During 2022-2023 tightening: Fed moved 25-75 bps per meeting
- During 2024-2025 easing: Fed moved 0-50 bps per meeting
- During pause periods (2023 H2, 2024 H1, 2025 H1): Zero movement for 3-6 consecutive meetings
- Recent pattern (Sep-Dec 2025): Three consecutive 25 bp cuts
- Most recent pattern (Jan 2026): Pause with hawkish statement revisions

**Key observation**: The January 2026 statement marked a clear shift toward patience. The removal of "downside risks to employment" language and upgrade of growth assessment suggests the bar for March cuts has risen significantly.

## (d) Justification

**Base case (highest probability): 3.75% - No change**

The convergence of evidence strongly supports a hold at the March meeting:

1. **Fed guidance**: December's "one additional cut by middle of next year" and January's hawkish statement revisions indicate March is too soon
2. **Official views**: Multiple Fed officials (Musalem, Bostic) believe current rate is at or near neutral
3. **Institutional forecasts**: Both BlackRock and Goldman Sachs expect pause early 2026, with cuts later (Goldman specifically forecasts March cut but their analysis predates the hawkish January statement)
4. **Recent pattern**: Fed just paused in January after three consecutive cuts, with upgraded economic assessment
5. **Political transition**: New Fed Chair expected after May 15; Committee may prefer stability during transition

**Secondary scenario: 3.50% - One 25 bp cut**

This requires:
- Significant labor market deterioration in next 5 weeks
- Inflation data showing clear progress toward 2%
- Fed pivoting from January's hawkish tone

Probability: Lower but non-trivial (~20-25%), given:
- Goldman Sachs forecast (though pre-January statement)
- Two January dissenters favoring cuts (Waller, Miran)
- Historical precedent of Fed surprising markets

**Tail scenarios**:

*Higher (4.00%+)*: Would require emergency inter-meeting hike or 50+ bp March hike. Extremely unlikely given:
- Powell explicitly dismissed prospect of hikes in December
- No inflation crisis warranting emergency action
- Fed's gradual approach

Probability: <5%

*Lower (3.25% or below)*: Would require 50 bp cut or multiple moves. Extremely unlikely given:
- January's hawkish statement
- Fed's "one cut by mid-year" guidance
- No crisis conditions

Probability: <5%

Outside view calibration:

The distribution should reflect:

1. **Modal outcome at 3.75%**: Strong consensus from recent Fed communications
2. **Asymmetric but bounded tails**: 
   - Upside limited by Fed's explicit dismissal of hikes and lack of inflation crisis
   - Downside limited by January's hawkish pivot and "near neutral" consensus
3. **Secondary mass at 3.50%**: Acknowledging non-trivial probability of one cut
4. **Wide 10th-90th range**: Accounting for unknown unknowns (economic shocks, geopolitical events, data surprises)

Historical upset rate in Fed forecasting: Markets frequently misjudge Fed timing by 1-2 meetings, but rarely miss direction over 2-month horizons when Fed has clearly signaled stance. January's statement was a clear signal for patience.

The 10th percentile should capture pessimistic scenarios (multiple cuts due to crisis), while 90th percentile should capture hawkish surprises (one hike or extended hold with future hikes priced in). However, given the 51-day timeframe and single scheduled meeting, the realistic range is narrower than longer-term forecasts.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.25
Percentile 20: 3.50
Percentile 40: 3.75
Percentile 60: 3.75
Percentile 80: 3.75
Percentile 90: 4.00
