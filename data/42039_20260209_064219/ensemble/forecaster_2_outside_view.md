## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Fed pause periods followed by resumption of cuts (2023-2024):**
   - June-July 2023: Paused at 5.50%, then one more hike
   - January-August 2025: Paused at 4.50% for 5 meetings, then resumed cuts
   - **Suitability:** Moderate - shows Fed can pause for extended periods

2. **Final stages of easing cycles:**
   - 2019: Cut from 2.50% to 1.75% over 3 meetings, then stopped
   - 2024-2025: Cut from 5.50% to 3.75% (175 bps), now pausing
   - **Suitability:** High - we appear to be in final stage approaching neutral

3. **Fed behavior near estimated neutral rate:**
   - Current median neutral estimate: 3.0%
   - Current rate: 3.75%
   - Historical pattern: Fed moves cautiously when near neutral
   - **Suitability:** Very High - most relevant to current situation

**Selected Reference Class:** Fed behavior near neutral rate with divided Committee and uncertain inflation trajectory.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 51 days (February 9 to March 31, 2026)

**Scheduled FOMC Meetings Before March 31:**
- March 18-19, 2026 (only one meeting in timeframe)

**Historical Patterns:**
- Since 2022, Fed has never changed rates by more than 50 bps at a single meeting during easing
- Recent pattern: 25 bp increments
- January 2026 showed hawkish shift with upgraded economic assessment
- Dot plot projects only ONE cut for all of 2026

**Key Considerations:**
1. Only one FOMC meeting opportunity (March 18-19)
2. January statement removed "downside risks to employment"
3. Inflation still at 3%, above 2% target
4. Fed officials divided: some see current rate as neutral (Musalem), others see room for 1-2 cuts (Bostic, Waller)
5. Powell emphasized data-dependence and "wait and see"

## (d) Justification

The outside view strongly suggests the upper bound will remain at **3.75%** on March 31, 2026, with small probability of movement.

**Base case (3.75% - no change): ~70% probability**
- January meeting showed hawkish tilt with upgraded economic language
- Only 51 days and one meeting before resolution date
- Fed officials emphasizing patience and data-dependence
- Dot plot shows only one cut for entire 2026
- Current rate (3.75%) is only 75 bps above median neutral estimate (3.0%)
- Recent pattern: Fed paused for 5 months (Jan-Aug 2025) before resuming cuts

**Cut to 3.50%: ~25% probability**
- Goldman Sachs forecasts March cut
- Two Fed governors (Waller, Miran) dissented in favor of cutting in January
- If labor market data weakens significantly in February
- Core inflation showing progress toward 2% target

**Cut to 3.25% (two cuts): ~3% probability**
- Would require 50bp cut or two meetings, neither realistic
- Fed hasn't done 50bp cut during this easing cycle except the initial September 2024 cut

**Increase to 4.00%: ~2% probability**
- Inflation reaccelerates significantly
- Historically unprecedented to reverse course this quickly
- No Fed official has suggested hikes

Outside view calibration:

The distribution should be heavily concentrated around 3.75% (status quo), with:
- Modest left tail (lower rates) reflecting possibility of March cut
- Very thin right tail (higher rates) reflecting low but non-zero probability of hawkish surprise
- The 10th-90th percentile range should be narrow (3.50% to 4.00%) given only one meeting and recent hawkish signals
- However, must account for unknown unknowns (economic shocks, financial instability, geopolitical events)

The key calibration challenge: balancing the strong signal for "hold" from January meeting against Goldman Sachs' credible forecast of March cut and the two dissenting governors who wanted to cut in January.

Given historical Fed behavior near neutral, the modal outcome is clearly 3.75%, but I should assign meaningful probability (~25%) to one 25bp cut given expert forecasts and dissenting votes.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.50
Percentile 20: 3.50
Percentile 40: 3.75
Percentile 60: 3.75
Percentile 80: 3.75
Percentile 90: 4.00
