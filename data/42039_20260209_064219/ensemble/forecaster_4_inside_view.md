Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)
1. TradingEconomics page (updated Feb 2026) – Factual: current target 3.50-3.75 %. High quality, official data mirror; no forward view.  
2. CME FedWatch live probabilities (captured 8 Feb 2026) – Market-implied: 19.9 % chance of a 25 bp cut in March, 80.1 % no change. 51.1 % odds of at least one 25 bp cut by June. Transparent methodology, strong signal.  
3. Silver/commodities article (8 Feb 2026, 证券时报) – Quotes San Francisco Fed President Daly: “one or two more cuts may be needed” (identifiable insider). Also cites current CME probabilities. Moderate evidence, some editorial noise.  
4. J.P. Morgan note (29 Jan 2026) – House view: no cut until summer 2026, at most one cut in 2026. Reputable sell-side research.  
5. December 2025 Fed dot-plot (Bondsavvy summary) – Official projections: median shows 0–2 cuts in 2026; one outlier at 2.00–2.25 %. Historical but still the only collective FOMC forecast.  
6. Fed Implementation Notes & FRED DFEDTARU series – Definitive factual record of the current 3.75 % upper bound.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence  
• Institutional structure: only one scheduled FOMC meeting (17-18 Mar 2026) lies between today and 31 Mar 2026; inter-meeting moves are exceedingly rare (1/160 windows since 2001).  
• CME FedWatch probabilities (derived from traded Fed-funds futures) overwhelmingly favour “no change”.  
Moderate evidence  
• Recent inflation 2.7 % y/y and cooling labour market give doves some ammunition; two public FOMC participants (Daly, Miran) advocate further easing.  
• Dot-plot & major bank research (JP Morgan, HSBC) point to at most one 25 bp cut in 2026.  
Weak evidence  
• Metals-price article speculation; macro-market sentiment pieces.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in 51 days.  If the horizon were halved (≈25 days), an inter-meeting move would become virtually impossible → probability mass would shift another ~3 % from “cut” to “no change”.  If doubled (≈100 days with two meetings), cut probability would rise dramatically (>40 %) because June becomes actionable.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
Start with outside-view distribution (10 % chance ≤3.25 %, 65 % 3.75 %, 25 % 3.50 %/hike tail).  
Adjustments:  
+ Market-implied odds (80 % hold, 20 % cut) – strong, pushes weight from 3.50 % to 3.75 %.  
+ Only one meeting left; historical base-rate for action in a single-meeting window 35 %, but current easing cycle already delivered three cuts last year and recent data have stabilised → lowers cut odds further.  
+ Visible intra-FOMC dissent & improving inflation keep a non--trivial chance of −25 bp.  
+ Upside tail (hike) requires an inflation shock in Feb or early-Mar; none is signalled, hence trimmed to 3 %.  
Resulting discrete probabilities: Hold 75 %, Cut 22 %, Hike 3 %.  To satisfy the “strictly increasing percentile” rule we smooth the mass ±0.10 pp around the discrete points.

Distribution calibration
I treat the 22 % cut probability as a uniform 3.35–3.60 % band (centre 3.50 %); 75 % hold as 3.70–3.80 % band (centre 3.75 %); 3 % hike as 3.90–4.10 % band (centre 4.00 %).  Mapping cumulative probabilities yields:

10th %ile ≈ 3.35  
20th %ile ≈ 3.50  
40th %ile ≈ 3.70  
60th %ile ≈ 3.75  
80th %ile ≈ 3.88  
90th %ile ≈ 4.05

Checklist:
1. Variable = upper bound of Fed-funds target range (%) on 31 Mar 2026.  
2. Base-rate distribution stated above.  
3. Implied median 3.75 %; mean 3.71 % – consistent with 75 % “hold”.  
4. Key evidence: a) CME futures 80 % no-change; b) One meeting left; c) Recent CPI 2.7 %; d) Fed dot-plot max 2 cuts in 2026; e) Jan-2026 FOMC 10-2 vote to hold.  
5. Blind-spot: February CPI >0.6 % m/m jolts core inflation higher → emergency hike (pushes outcome up).  
6. Status-quo bias checked – still dominant 75 %.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, units = percent.
