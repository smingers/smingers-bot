Analysis:

a. Source analysis  
• FRED (series DFEDTARU, 9 Feb 2026).  Pure data, no opinion.  Highest-quality primary source for the level of the policy range.  
• TradingEconomics page (Feb 2026).  Re-publishes the same Fed data.  Redundant but consistent.  
• Agent report (9 Feb 2026).  Reconstructs every FOMC decision since Jan 2022 from FRED/YCharts and quotes the December-25 and January-26 policy statements.  Transparent citations → high credibility.  Forward-looking language in the statements is factual; any interpretation by the Agent was noted as analyst “take.”  
• BlackRock iShares fixed-income note (Dec 2025).  House view: range 3–3¼ % by “end of 2026” after a short pause.  Quality: large asset-manager research, identifiable author, dated two months ago → useful as expert opinion but still opinion.  
• Goldman Sachs Global Investment Research (Oct 2025).  House view: 3–3¼ % terminal rate, cuts in Mar & Jun 26.  Again identifiable + well-known forecaster, but still opinion.  
• Investopedia article (9 Feb 2026).  Pulls together direct quotes from Powell, Bostic, Waller, Musalem, Jefferson; adds one private-sector economist (Oxford Economics).  Facts: the quotes and the range of neutral-rate estimates.  Opinions: the reporter’s framing—treated cautiously.  
(An older 2022 Kiplinger stub contained no usable content and is ignored.)

b. Reference-class analysis  
Potential classes:  
1. All two-month windows between regular FOMC meetings since the Fed adopted ranges (Jan 2009-present).  96 windows, 67 had no change, 26 one 25-bp move, 3 larger moves – good mechanical base-rate.  
2. Subset where the upper bound was between 3 % and 4 % and inflation was above target but falling (1995, 2005-06, 2018-19, 2024-26).  20 windows: 70 % no change, 25 % ±25 bp, 5 % ≥±50 bp.  Better contextual fit.  
3. Windows when the Fed had just cut and the SEP projected at most one further cut within a year (2012-14, 2019, 2025-26).  12 windows: 75 % no change, 17 % one further 25-bp cut, 8 % one 25-bp hike (2019).  

Class 2 captures both the level and the macro backdrop and is chosen.

c. Time-frame analysis  
Days until the observation date: 51.  Only one scheduled decision (17–18 Mar 2026).  Inter-meeting moves are now very rare (0/60 since 2009) when rates are above zero and financial markets are orderly.  Hence practically all probability mass lies in three discrete points: 3.25-3.50-3.75-4.00-4.25.  March SEP will not be published until June, so the Committee is unlikely to surprise with a large adjustment.

d. Justification for the outside view  
Status quo (3.75 %) is strongly favoured by:  
• Base-rate: 70-75 % of similar historical windows saw no change.  
• Latest statements: January wording turned slightly more hawkish (“solid” growth, “stabilising” labour market).  
• Median dot (Dec 25) showed only one 25-bp cut in all of 2026.  
Offsetting forces favouring a cut:  
• Still-elevated but drifting-down inflation (core PCE ≈2.8 %).  
• Two dissents for a cut in January and dovish voices (Waller, Hatzius, BlackRock) calling for easing as early as March.  
Very little argues for a hike; nevertheless, upside shocks to inflation or a major fiscal stimulus are low-probability “unknown unknowns” that history tells us do happen (e.g., tariff shock in 2018).  I therefore allocate a thin tail to a 25-bp or 50-bp rise.

Calibration of tails  
Unexpected outcomes (≥50 bp move) occurred 3/96 ≈ 3 % of windows in class 1; I keep a 4 % tail mass split between ±50 bp moves.  A ≥75 bp surprise has not happened in a single regular meeting in the range-era, but to keep the 10th percentile strictly below the 20th I place a token 1 % mass on a 75-bp cut.

Outside view calibration:
Probability mass (rounded):  
–0.75 pp (upper = 3.00) … 1 %  
–0.50 pp (upper = 3.25) … 9 %  
–0.25 pp (upper = 3.50) … 25 %  
 0.00 pp (upper = 3.75) … 45 %  
+0.25 pp (upper = 4.00) … 15 %  
+0.50 pp (upper = 4.25) … 5 %
