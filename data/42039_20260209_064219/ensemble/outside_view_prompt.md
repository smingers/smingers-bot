The forecasting question is:
What will be the upper bound of the Federal Funds Target Range on March 31, 2026?

Question background:
The Federal Funds Target Range is the primary tool used by the Federal Reserve to influence economic conditions in the United States. This question tracks the upper bound of that range as of March 31, 2026.

`{"format":"bot_tournament_question","info":{"hash_id":"037be701c5e6a1c6","sheet_id":65.2}}`

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves to the value of the upper bound of the target range for the federal funds rate as set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), effective on March 31, 2026. The primary source for resolution is the Federal Reserve Board's official 'Implementation Note' or 'Policy Statement' issued following the most recent FOMC meeting prior to or on March 31, 2026. If the Federal Reserve specifies a single target rate rather than a range, that single rate will serve as the resolution value. Resolves based on data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) series 'DFEDTARU' (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFEDTARU)

# Summary of "The Fed's Big 2026 Debate: What's a Normal Level for Rates?"

**Source:** Investopedia, February 09, 2026

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Current Federal Funds Rate:** Between 3.5% to 3.75% (as of the article date)
2. **Recent Rate Cut History:** Six rate cuts occurred in 2024 and 2025, with three cuts in the previous year alone
3. **Historical Context:** 
   - Fed slashed rates to near-zero during COVID
   - Later hiked rates above 5% when inflation spiked
4. **Current Inflation:** Closer to 3% (compared to Fed's 2% target)

## Fed Officials' Estimates of the Neutral Rate:

- **Current median forecast:** 3.0%
- **Pre-pandemic (end of 2019) median forecast:** 2.5%
- **Range of current forecasts among Fed officials:** 2.6% to 3.9%

## Named Source Opinions:

**Jerome Powell (Current Fed Chair):**
- "It's hard to look at the incoming data and say that policy's significantly restrictive at this time. It may be sort of loosely neutral, or it may be somewhat restrictive; it's in the eye of the beholder. And of course, no one knows with any precision."
- Fed is "well-positioned here to watch how the economy forms" and "let the data speak to us"
- Current rate is "within the range of plausible estimates" of neutral

**Alberto Musalem (St. Louis Fed President):**
- Believes the current 3.5% to 3.75% setting "is neutral" and appropriate
- "With inflation above target and the risks to the outlook evenly balanced, I believe it would be unadvisable to lower the rate into accommodative territory at this time"
- Would support cutting "if further signs of labor market weakness emerge"

**Raphael Bostic (Atlanta Fed President):**
- Believes neutral is "perhaps one or two rate cuts away"
- Did not pencil in any rate cuts for 2026
- "I think we have so much momentum in the economy that we need to keep our policy rate in a mildly restrictive stance"
- "This is a time to be patient"

**Chris Waller (Fed Governor):**
- Voted in the minority to cut rates in the most recent meeting
- Believes Fed policy is "still restricting economic activity" and rates "should be closer to neutral"
- Pointed to median neutral estimate of 3%, below current 3.5% to 3.75%
- "I favored reducing the policy rate to strengthen the labor market and guard against a deterioration that would be harder to address once it has begun"

**Philip Jefferson (Fed Vice Chair):**
- On AI's impact: "There is still much to learn. I counsel exercising humility about the challenges in predicting AI's effects on employment and inflation"

**Michael Pearce (Chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics):**
- "The Fed always moves more cautiously when rates are close to a neutral setting"

## Additional Context:

- **Political Note:** President Donald Trump's nominee for Fed chair, Kevin Warsh, is expected to join the central bank
- **Complicating Factors:** Persistent inflation, shifting global supply chains (from post-COVID shifts or tariffs), and uncertain effects from artificial intelligence are making neutral rate estimates difficult

Over the full period the upper bound moved from 0.25 % to a peak of 5.50 % (Jul 2023) and has since declined by 1.75 percentage points to 3.75 %.

2.  Forward guidance in the latest two statements

December 2025 meeting (decision released 10 Dec 2025)

• Action & vote: third consecutive 25 bp cut to 3.50 %-3.75 % by a 9-3 vote, showing the most internal division since 2019 (CNBC; Chase).  
• Statement language: added reference to “the extent and timing of additional adjustments,” replacing the earlier phrase that simply anticipated “additional adjustments.” Analysts interpreted the tweak as raising the bar for further cuts and signalling a slower pace (CNBC).  
• Balance-sheet: the Fed announced renewed Treasury-bill purchases of USD 40 bn beginning two days after the meeting, aimed at keeping reserves “ample” (CNBC).  
• Powell’s press conference:  
  – Characterised the decision as a “close call” and said policy is now “within a broad range of estimates of neutral,” allowing the Committee to “wait and see how the economy evolves.”  
  – Emphasised that the main risk has shifted toward weakness in the labour market, while inflation—still above 2 %—is expected to ease as tariff effects fade (Chase).  
  – Dismissed the prospect of rate hikes; instead the baseline was an extended pause with maybe “one additional cut by the middle of next year” if the data weaken (Chase).  
• Dots/projections: the Summary of Economic Projections showed only one additional 2026 cut, consistent with a shallow easing path (Chase).

Bottom line: December’s statement and remarks framed the December cut as “insurance,” indicated the Fed believes it is near neutral, and signalled that any further easing would be gradual and data-dependent.

January 2026 meeting (decision released 28 Jan 2026)

• Action & vote: the Committee paused, keeping the range at 3.50 %-3.75 %. Governors Waller and Miran dissented in favour of another cut (Nuveen; Fed press release 28 Jan 2026).  
• Statement changes:  
  – Upgraded its description of the labour market, noting the unemployment rate “has shown some signs of stabilization” and removed explicit reference to “downside risks to employment,” a hawkish tilt (Nuveen).  
  – Described recent economic growth as “solid” (previously “moderate”), signalling more confidence in activity (Nuveen).  
• Chair Powell’s message: reiterated that the Fed is “well-positioned to determine the extent and timing of additional adjustments,” and stressed that the inflation trajectory will dictate future moves—“if inflation declines later this year, that would be something that tells us that we can loosen policy” (Nuveen).  
• Dot plot (unchanged from December): still projects only one 25 bp cut in 2026 (Nuveen).  

Bottom line: The January statement reinforced a watch-and-wait stance, but with slightly more upbeat language on growth and employment, implying the hurdle for near-term easing has risen. Future cuts remain possible but will require clearer progress on inflation.

3.  Information sufficiency / remaining gaps

• The DFEDTARU levels for each regular meeting through 28 Jan 2026 are fully covered by the YCharts series (which reproduces FRED data).  
• There were no unscheduled inter-meeting target-range changes in the period, so the meeting list is exhaustive.  
• The qualitative guidance from both the December 2025 and January 2026 statements and press conferences has been captured from multiple public sources (CNBC, Chase, Nuveen, Federal Reserve).  
No additional data appear necessary to satisfy the original query. If finer detail were needed—such as exact red-line changes in the official statements or the December “dot plot” table—one could consult the official statement PDFs on federalreserve.gov, but those nuances do not alter the summary above.

The analysis therefore fully addresses the requested history, meeting-by-meeting changes, and the forward-guidance narrative entering 2026.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
