Analysis:
The rate that will apply on March 31 2026 will be the one decided at the FOMC meeting scheduled for mid-March 2026 (the last meeting before that date).  Therefore, the most useful information right now is:
• Pricing of March-2026 Fed-funds futures and CME FedWatch probabilities.  
• Sell-side and research notes (banks, think-tanks) revising forecasts after the latest January 2026 FOMC decision and after recent inflation/payrolls data.  
• Statements or speeches from FOMC voters between the January and March meetings that hint at “higher for longer” versus rate-cut timing.  
• Media coverage synthesising the above (e.g. WSJ, Bloomberg, FT, Reuters).  
Finding these sources will require searches that combine the date (March 2026), the specific policy instrument (federal-funds upper bound), and words like “forecast”, “expectations”, or “FOMC”.  Because much of the freshest material is in financial-news wires, Google News is appropriate for headline scanning, while a general Google search can surface CME pages, bank PDFs, and FRED data.  AskNews can be used to pull together the latest consensus commentary in natural-language form.
