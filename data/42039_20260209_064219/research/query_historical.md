Analysis:
To build an outside view I first need a precise snapshot of where the FOMC has the target range today (upper-bound), how often and by how much it has moved over the last two years, and what the Fed’s own Summary of Economic Projections (SEP) and market pricing imply for the rest of 2026. Historical context that matters most:  
• Sequence of target-range upper bounds during the 2022-2026 tightening cycle (magnitude and spacing of moves).  
• Instances since 1994 when the Fed was still adjusting rates this close to a presidential election year to gauge whether a “pause” or further cuts are typical.  
• Current commentary and reporting on the January 28-29 2026 FOMC meeting (the most recent completed meeting) and expectations for the March 17-18 2026 meeting (the last meeting before Mar 31).  
• Market-implied terminal-rate distributions (euro-dollar / SOFR futures, OIS) and economists’ consensus forecasts for end-Q1 2026.  
These items will help bound plausible outcomes between, say, 3 % and 6½ %, and identify tail risks beyond that range.
