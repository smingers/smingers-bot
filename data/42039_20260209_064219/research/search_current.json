Morgan Stanley's global market strategy team, led by analyst Jason Hunter, stated that gold, silver, and copper are entering a 'consolidation phase' but not the end of the bull market. Hunter emphasized that the current adjustment is a necessary pause in a long-term uptrend, with key differentiation expected: while gold may see 'buy-high, sell-low' patterns, basic metals like copper are underpinned by strong fundamentals from global manufacturing cycles and are expected to rebound before gold in the second quarter. U.S. Treasury Secretary Bessent stated that the Federal Reserve is unlikely to rapidly shrink its balance sheet, even under the leadership of nominee Powell, noting that decisions could take up to a year, and that the Fed may remain in 'ample reserves' policy. San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly indicated that one or two more rate cuts may be needed due to weak labor markets, with inflation still above the 2% target but expected to slow by mid-year. The CME FedWatch Tool shows a 19.9% probability of a 25-basis-point rate cut by March, 80.1% chance of no change, and a 51.1% probability of cumulative 25-basis-point cuts by June. Meanwhile, industrial silicon futures hit a recent low of 8,500 yuan/ton on February 6, down 3.95% weekly, driven by weak demand and macro sentiment. Downstream demand remains weak: polysilicon output is expected to drop to around 80,000 tons in February, organic silicon capacity is adjusting, and aluminum alloy plant\u5f00\u5de5 rates are declining. Inventory data shows a slight build-up in total stock (1.0064 million tons), with upstream inventories falling and downstream inventories rising. Analysts from CITIC Securities, Yidu Futures, and Guotai Junan suggest that industrial silicon prices may remain range-bound due to weak fundamentals and seasonal holiday effects, advising traders to reduce or avoid positions during the Lunar New Year break.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 11:58 PM\nSource:[\u8bc1\u5238\u65f6\u62a5\u7f51_\u8bc1\u5238\u65f6\u62a5\u65d7\u4e0b\u8d44\u8baf\u5e73\u53f0_\u80a1\u7968_\u57fa\u91d1_\u671f\u8d27_\u503a\u5238_\u7406\u8d22_\u8d22\u7ecf_\u884c\u60c5_\u6570\u636e_\u80a1\u5427_\u535a\u5ba2_\u8bba\u575b](https://stcn.com/article/detail/3634615.html)\n\n**Haryana targets 22% cut in average air quality index by year end under CAQM plan | Gurgaon News - The Times of India**\nHaryana has submitted its annual action plan to the Commission for Air Quality Management (CAQM) with a target to reduce the state's average Air Quality Index (AQI) by 21.5% by the end of 2026, aiming to bring it down from 138 in 2024 to 120. The plan includes long-term targets to reduce annual average PM2.5 to 58 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 and PM10 to 106 \u00b5g/m\u00b3 by 2030. For Gurgaon, the plan outlines specific measures: dust control on 294 roads by 2026, with a monthly target of 50 km of road coverage; expansion of city bus services from 150 to 1,000 buses, with 100 buses to be added in March 2026 and another 100 in October 2026; and the development of 20 electric vehicle (EV) charging points, with 10 to be installed by June 2026 and the remaining 10 by September 2026. Haryana currently operates 29 continuous ambient air quality monitoring stations (CAAQMS), with a target of 41 by March 31, 2026, leaving a gap of 12. Gurgaon has 18 mechanical road sweeping machines against an assessed need of 42, and 4,910 manual sweepers against a requirement of 5,426. The plan also addresses 2,204 construction sites across NCR, including Gurgaon, for dust mitigation.

Despite broad market weakness, there was a surge in 52-week highs on both the NYSE and S&P 500, suggesting the pullback may be a cyclical correction rather than the start of a bear market. Sector analysis reveals a concerning divergence: defensive sectors like energy (XLE), consumer staples (XLP), and healthcare (XLV) are outperforming, while growth-oriented sectors\u2014technology (XLK) and consumer discretionary (XLY)\u2014have underperformed since the start of Q4 2025. The energy-to-tech ratio (XLE/XLK) is showing signs of a potential breakout from a rounding bottom, which, if confirmed by breaking above the March 2025 high, could signal a structural shift favoring energy over tech\u2014a potential warning for equities. Similarly, the consumer staples-to-discretionary ratio (XLP/XLY) has turned upward, indicating a shift from 'wants' to 'needs' in consumer behavior, a bearish signal for growth. In bonds, the TIP/IEF ratio has formed a symmetrical triangle, and a breakout above the upper trendline would suggest rising inflation expectations, complicating the Federal Reserve\u2019s path to rate cuts.

Despite a three-year economic program, inflation has only been reduced to the low 30s, and the likelihood of reaching the target by year-end is now nearly impossible. The Central Bank is set to release its first 2026 Inflation Report next week, with some economists predicting the target will remain at 16%, while others expect it to rise to 19%. Recent preliminary data from the Web-T\u00fcfe platform shows a projected inflation rate of 2.89% for February, with final data expected on February 25. Rising food prices, continued increases in fuel prices tied to global oil markets, and heightened consumer expectations ahead of Ramadan suggest inflation will not decline. If February\u2019s monthly inflation exceeds last year\u2019s 2.27%, annual inflation will resume its upward trend. With January\u2019s inflation at 2.46%, the risk of sustained upward pressure remains into March. Even if inflation eventually declines in summer months, the current trajectory makes a single-digit inflation target for 2026 highly unlikely. While some economists argue that maintaining the 16% target preserves credibility and avoids undermining policy legitimacy, others believe revising the target to 19% is necessary to restore market confidence and allow for a March interest rate cut. However, many experts stress that even with a 19% target, interest rates may need to rise, not fall, due to persistent inflationary pressures. Market expectations currently project inflation around 24% by the end of 2026, with a likely early election in late 2027 and a new election-driven economic policy cycle expected to follow. Given that inflation has not fallen to single digits despite three years of program implementation, and that the burden has disproportionately fallen on low- and fixed-income groups, the outlook for achieving single-digit inflation in the near or medium term is bleak.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 06:52 AM\nSource:[Son Dakika](https://www.sondakika.com/haber/haber-enflasyon-hedeflerinde-belirsizlik-19548934/)\n\n**Turkey's Inflation Target at Single Digits Now Unlikely: Analysts Warn of Reversal**\nTurkey's goal of reducing inflation to single digits remains uncertain, as economic analysts continue debating the future of inflation and interest rate policies ahead of the Central Bank's upcoming 2026 Inflation Report. Despite a three-year economic program, inflation has only been brought down to the 30s, and recent data has heightened pessimism, with a growing risk that annual inflation may resume its upward trend. Preliminary February data from the Web-T\u00fcfe platform indicates a projected monthly inflation rate of 2.89%, with final figures expected on February 25. Persistent food price increases, ongoing fuel price hikes tied to global oil prices, and heightened consumer expectations ahead of Ramadan are reinforcing this trend. If February's inflation exceeds the 2.27% recorded in the same month last year, annual inflation will likely reverse its decline and begin rising again. Given that monthly inflation reached 2.46% in March 2025, the upward trend could persist into March. A rebound in annual inflation may only reverse in the summer months. While some economists believe the Central Bank will maintain its 16% inflation target, others expect it to revise the target upward to 19%. Even if the target remains unchanged, achieving it would likely require interest rate hikes rather than cuts, making a March rate reduction impossible. A target revision to 19% could allow for a rate cut in March. However, some analysts argue that maintaining the 16% target would undermine credibility, transparency, and public trust, especially if it leads to criticism that the Bank prioritized pension and salary policies over inflation control. Market expectations currently point to around 24% inflation by the end of 2026, with a likely early election in late 2027 and new election-driven economic policies expected to follow. Thus, the likelihood of inflation reaching single digits in the near or medium term is virtually nonexistent. The failure to achieve the 2025 single-digit target, despite a three-year program, underscores the program's shortcomings. During this period, poverty has increased, and the burden has disproportionately fallen on low- and fixed-income groups. The continued inability to reduce inflation signals that the same economic hardships will persist.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 06:41 AM\nSource:[Haberler](https://www.haberler.com/guncel/enflasyon-rakamlari-ve-merkez-bankasi-nin-hedefi-tartismalari-19548918-haberi/)\n\n**March and April Inflation Data Critical for Turkey\u2019s 2026 Target**\nTurkey began 2026 with high inflation, recording a 4.8% inflation rate in January\u2014above the 3.5% threshold considered problematic by economic analysts. This figure reflects persistent non-normalized pricing behavior, influenced by factors such as minimum wage increases, exchange rates, global commodity prices, and other structural elements. The Central Bank\u2019s interim target for the end of 2026 has an upper band of 19%, and although January\u2019s data slightly reduced the likelihood of exceeding this target, policymakers must work intensively to meet it. The inflation figures for March and April are therefore critical, as historically these months have averaged around 0.95% inflation. To stay on track, these months must deliver figures close to historical averages. The Central Bank\u2019s inflation calculation methodology was updated in line with international standards, increasing the weight of services and reducing that of basic goods\u2014this shift is expected to raise annual inflation by one percentage point compared to 2025, complicating policy implementation. To achieve disinflation, effective communication and strong policy actions are essential to convince the public and firms that inflation will decline. Meanwhile, the manufacturing sector showed mixed signals in January: while input costs rose and prices increased at the fastest pace in 21 months, production rose in five of ten sectors, with four exceeding the 50 threshold indicating economic vitality. Notably, textiles\u2014once a struggling sector\u2014recorded production growth for the first time in 31 months, while chemicals, plastics, and rubber industries led the recovery. These developments suggest that the worst may be behind the manufacturing sector.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 04:11 AM\nSource:[Sabah](https://www.sabah.com.tr/yazarlar/nurullah-gur/2026/02/08/mart-nisan-enflasyon-icin-kritik)\n\n**PT Approves Resolution Criticizing Central Bank and Advocating Inflation Target Revision**\nThe National Directory of the Workers' Party (PT) approved a resolution on Friday, February 6, 2026, calling for a reduction in Brazil's Selic interest rate, currently at 15% per year, and a revision of the inflation target set at 3% for 2026 with a tolerance range of 1.5 percentage points. The PT stated that the current interest rate is 'restrictive and incompatible' with the country's economic development needs. The party argues that the current monetary policy, led by the Central Bank (BC), has become an obstacle to the 'project elected at the ballot box.' Despite criticizing the BC's conduct, the party acknowledges that Gabriel Gal\u00edpolo, the Central Bank president, was appointed by President Luiz In\u00e1cio Lula da Silva in 2024 and remains a trusted figure, with Lula stating, 'I believe and trust in the work Gal\u00edpolo is doing.' In January, the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) maintained the Selic rate at 15% but signaled a potential start to rate cuts in March. The PT advocates aligning inflation control with economic growth, job creation, public investment, and expanded social policies. In 2025, the IPCA inflation rate ended at 4.26%, below the target ceiling but above the central target of 3%. Market economists revised their 2026 inflation forecast from 4% to 3.99%. The resolution also reviews the PT's governance and reaffirms social priorities for 2026, including ending the 6x1 work schedule, introducing zero fares on public transport, and regulating app-based work. Politically, the party reaffirms support for multilateralism and criticizes the use of parliamentary amendments to capture public budgets, which it claims distorts presidentialism and enables political extortion against the Executive.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 07, 2026 07:18 PM\nSource:[Valor Econ\u00f4mico](https://valor.globo.com/politica/noticia/2026/02/07/pt-aprova-resoluo-com-crticas-ao-bc-e-defesa-da-reviso-da-meta-de-inflao.ghtml)\n\n**La Jornada: Publishes Audit Calendar for Sheinbaum's First Year of Government**\nThe Federal Audit Office (ASF) published the 2025 Annual Audit Program in the Official Journal of the Federation, outlining 2,476 audits to be conducted during the first year of President Claudia Sheinbaum Pardo's administration.

The PBO estimates an additional $33.5 billion in annual defence spending will be required between now and 2035 to meet the 3.5% benchmark, with a further 1.5% allocated to defence infrastructure, totaling 5% of GDP. This projection assumes Canada will meet its prior pledge of reaching 2% of GDP on defence by March 2026, which Prime Minister Mark Carney fulfilled with a $9 billion injection. However, the PBO notes a significant lack of transparency: the 2025 federal budget did not include detailed, year-by-year defence spending projections, unlike previous budgets, and the Department of National Defence (DND) declined to provide a spending path. DND instead referenced estimates of $150 billion for military spending and $60 billion for infrastructure by 2035, subject to change. These figures differ from earlier government estimates of $100 billion for military and $50 billion for infrastructure spending. The PBO criticized the government's lack of published supporting data, stating that 'despite indicating in Budget 2025 that accelerating investments will 'put Canada on a pathway' to meet the NATO five per cent commitment by 2035, the government has not published supporting projection details.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 04:27 PM\nSource:[CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/nato-defence-spending-canada-budget-deficit-9.7075474)\n\n**Inflation at critical juncture: First three months decisive**\nEconomist Mustafa A\u015fk\u0131n evaluated the latest inflation data released in Turkey, noting that the monthly inflation rate reached 4.8%, exceeding expectations and signaling significant ongoing risks. He highlighted that while the annual inflation showed a slight decline due to base effects, the monthly trend remains problematic. A\u015fk\u0131n pointed to price increases in taxes, fees, government-set prices, and certain agricultural products as key drivers of inflation. He also noted that T\u00dc\u0130K's revised calculation methodology led to a 0.1 percentage point lower inflation figure, providing a minor advantage. A\u015fk\u0131n warned that inflation could remain high in January, February, and March, with Ramadan's arrival in late February potentially driving food prices up and affecting March inflation. He emphasized that the first three months of the year could consume 30-35% of the Central Bank's inflation target range\u2014between 16% (midpoint) and 19% (upper bound)\u2014posing a serious warning sign.

This change follows strong returns from domestic and foreign equities and foreign bonds, which have increased surplus funds to 540 billion yen\u2014reaching the target. The current 1% cap on supplementary benefits, based on accumulated surplus funds, will be removed to allow greater payouts to members. The MHLW presented the revision proposal at the Small and Medium-Sized Enterprise Retirement Pension Mutual Aid Subcommittee of the Labour Policy Council on February 4, 2026. The supplementary retirement benefit is paid on top of the basic pension when investment gains are realized, with the amount determined by projected annual profits. The MHLW also plans to review the current 1% projected rate of return by the end of fiscal year 2027, as Japanese government bond yields have risen above this rate. The system had 3.57 million members and assets totaling 5.5 trillion yen as of March 2025. If surplus funds fall below the target again, the previous 1% cap will be reinstated. The 2026 supplementary benefit payout rate will be announced in March.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 07:00 AM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOUA042E30U6A200C2000000/)\n\n**Forex Analysis & Reviews: 04.02.2026 - EUR/USD. On the Cusp of the 17 Figure**\nOn February 4, 2026, the EUR/USD pair tested the 1.17 figure amid a broader strengthening of the US dollar, declining nearly 300 pips over several days\u2014from near 1.21 a week earlier to a low of 1.1783. The dollar's strength is driven by reduced 'dovish' expectations for Federal Reserve rate cuts, as indicated by the CME FedWatch Tool: only an 8% chance of a rate cut in March, nearly 80% chance of holding rates steady in April, and a 50/50 split for a June cut. This shift is influenced by resilient US inflation\u2014particularly in services\u2014and a strong labor market with steady wage growth and no sharp rise in unemployment. The ISM Manufacturing Index unexpectedly surged to 52.6 (the highest since August 2022), exceeding the forecast of 48.5, with new orders at 57.1 and production at 55.9. However, the employment sub-index remained in contraction at 48.1, and the Prices Paid component showed persistent input cost pressures. These data supported a Fed 'wait-and-see' stance, boosting dollar bulls. The upcoming ISM Services Index release (forecast 53.6, but could exceed 54.4) may further strengthen the dollar if it shows positive momentum. Geopolitical uncertainty persists over Iran, with US envoy Steven Witkoff and Jared Kushner set to meet Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, though Iran refuses to allow export of enriched uranium, creating a standoff. The US government shutdown is expected to end this week, following Senate approval of a funding package, with House approval likely today or Wednesday. Technically, EUR/USD is below all Ichimoku lines and between the middle and lower Bollinger Bands, indicating a bearish bias. The first target is 1.1750 (lower Bollinger Band on H4, middle on D1), with the primary target at 1.1700 (top of the Kumo cloud on daily chart).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 02:51 AM\nSource:[InstaForex](https://www.instaforex.com/forex_analysis/437169)\n\n**BC Says Size and Duration of Interest Rate Cuts Will Depend on Data and Restrictive Policy**\nThe Central Bank (BC) of Brazil decided to maintain the Selic interest rate at 15% per year, signaling the start of a monetary easing cycle in March 2026. According to the Central Bank's minutes, this decision aligns with the current economic environment, marked by mixed signals about the pace of economic slowdown and its impact on inflation, making clear trends difficult to identify. The Bank reaffirmed its commitment to the 3% inflation target. All members of the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) emphasized the need to keep interest rates at restrictive levels until both inflation reduction and anchoring of market expectations for consumer prices are consolidated. The Bank cited persistent inflationary pressures, particularly from the still-strong labor market, where real wages continue to rise above productivity growth. The decision to signal a rate cut in March was based on improved inflation dynamics and clearer transmission of monetary policy to the economy, despite lags. While market expectations have improved and are closer to the target, long-term projections remain above the center of the target range. The Focus report showed the IPCA forecast for 2026 dropping from 4.16% to 4.00%, while 2027 remained at 3.80% and 2028 at 3.50%. Copom maintained its inflation risk assessment as balanced but noted a slight reduction in uncertainties for shorter-term horizons. The external environment remains uncertain, though recent conditions suggest some easing, with commodity prices contained and financial conditions favorable. Geopolitical tensions are still being monitored.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 08:13 AM\nSource:[terra.com.br](https://www.terra.com.br/economia/bc-diz-que-tamanho-e-duracao-do-ciclo-de-corte-de-juros-dependera-de-dados-e-prega-politica-restritiva,5b081443d5c36defbe4b7a0dd296c58822jpbegb.html)\n\n**What is the federal funds rate?**\nThe federal funds rate is the interest rate set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which influences borrowing costs and investment returns across the U.S. financial system. On December 18, 2024, the Federal Reserve lowered the federal funds rate by 25 basis points, setting the target range at 4.25% to 4.50%, marking the third rate cut of 2024. The effective federal funds rate, the volume-weighted median of overnight interbank lending rates, was 4.50% as of December 18, 2024. The FOMC, composed of the Fed\u2019s Board of Governors and five regional Federal Reserve Bank presidents, meets at least eight times annually to adjust the rate based on economic conditions. The rate is used to manage inflation and economic growth: lowering it stimulates borrowing and spending, while raising it curbs inflation by increasing borrowing costs. The federal funds rate affects the prime rate, credit card interest, mortgage rates, savings account yields, Treasury yields, corporate bond rates, and stock market performance. Fed Chair Jerome Powell described the December 2024 rate cut as 'the best decision' to achieve maximum employment and price stability, and emphasized cautious rate cuts in 2025. The next FOMC meeting is scheduled for January 28\u201329, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 12:04 AM\nSource:[Business Insider](https://www.businessinsider.com/personal-finance/investing/what-is-the-federal-funds-rate)\n\n**NY Bonds: U.S. Long-Term Bond Market Trades Range-Bound as FOMC Minutes Highlight Cautious Stance on Further Rate Cuts**\nThe U.S. long-term bond market showed a range-bound trading session on December 30, 2025, following the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes from the December 2025 meeting. The minutes revealed a detailed discussion among Fed officials regarding current economic risks, with some policymakers expressing caution about further rate cuts despite overall support for lowering rates. While most participants supported rate cuts, several emphasized that the progress toward the 2% inflation target has stalled, suggesting that the federal funds rate target range should remain unchanged for a period after any cut. Some participants also argued that rate cuts could be appropriate as a preemptive strategy to support labor market stability amid weakening job creation. Market expectations continue to reflect approximately two rate cuts in 2026. The yield curve showed a steepening trend, with the 2-year to 10-year spread at 67.80 basis points and the 2-year to 30-year spread at 136.10 basis points. The 10-year yield opened near 4.108%, dipped to around 4.102%, rose to 4.140%, and closed near 4.116%. The 2-year yield ended at 3.44% (down 1 basis point), the 10-year yield at 4.12% (up 1 basis point), and the 30-year yield at 4.80% (unchanged). According to CME's FedWatch tool, the probability of the federal funds rate target range being set at 3.50\u20133.75% at the January 2026 FOMC meeting was approximately 85%, and the probability of it being 3.25\u20133.50% or lower at the March 2026 meeting was about 52%.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: December 30, 2025 11:20 PM\nSource:[\u8ca1\u7d4c\u65b0\u805e](https://www.zaikei.co.jp/article/20251231/838453.html)\n\n**LDO 2026 Relator Indicates Government May Use Fiscal Target Floor for Contingency in 2026**\nThe vote on the 2026 Fiscal Guidelines Law (LDO), scheduled for Wednesday afternoon (December 3, 2025), coincides with the Tribunal de Contas da Uni\u00e3o (TCU) resuming its discussion on whether the federal government should pursue the central target of the fiscal goal in 2026. The rapporteur of the 2026 LDO, Deputy Gerv\u00e1sio Maia (PSB-PB), indicated on Tuesday (December 2) that the final text will likely include the possibility for the government to use the floor of the fiscal target\u2014estimated at around R$ 34 billion\u2014for budgetary contingency. This would allow the Executive to adopt the lower bound of the fiscal target (the 'piso') as a reference point for spending cuts. The Ministry of Finance has been negotiating with Congress leadership to include this provision in the LDO. The fiscal target is structured in three bands: upper, central, and lower. The central target for 2026, as submitted by the government, is a zero deficit, consistent with recent years. The TCU previously ruled in September that using the lower band for contingency is irregular and that the central target (zero deficit) must be pursued. However, after a government appeal, the TCU allowed the use of the lower band for 2025, leaving the 2026 situation unresolved. TCU President Minister Vital do R\u00eago reiterated that the government must aim for the central target, emphasizing that 'the commitment is with the center' and that failure to do so could undermine the fiscal framework. He also stressed the importance of the 'empo\u00e7amento'\u2014unspent budgeted funds\u2014for determining whether the central target is met, stating that the government must execute its budget to reach the center of the target.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 10:01 PM\nSource:[globo.com](https://g1.globo.com/economia/noticia/2025/12/02/relator-da-ldo-indica-que-governo-podera-usar-piso-da-meta-fiscal-para-contingenciamento-em-2026.ghtml)\n\n**BC Cannot Pursue Upper Band of Inflation Target, Says Gal\u00edpolo**\nGabriel Gal\u00edpolo, President of the Central Bank (BC), stated during a Senate Economic Affairs Committee (CAE) hearing on November 30, 2025, that the institution should not target the upper bound of the inflation target range\u20144.5%\u2014but rather the central target of 3%.

She noted that recent data show labor\u2011market vulnerability has risen sharply and that, even after removing tariff effects, inflation remains close to the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Bowman warned that the Fed is at serious risk of falling behind in addressing labor\u2011market deterioration and that if the situation persists, policy may need to be adjusted more quickly and at larger scale. The Fed\u2019s most recent policy meeting lowered the federal\u2011funds target range by 25 basis points to 4.00%\u20114.25%. Bowman and most colleagues voted for the 25\u2011basis\u2011point cut, while new board member Stephen M. Milei had pushed for a 50\u2011basis\u2011point cut. Bowman also said she prefers a smaller balance\u2011sheet, keeping reserves near scarce levels, and that the Fed should maintain a short\u2011term Treasury\u2011only balance\u2011sheet with flexibility to shift to longer\u2011dated bonds if needed. She expressed interest in raising the standing repo facility (SRF) floor rate above the upper bound of the federal\u2011funds target range to keep the tool as a last\u2011resort liquidity buffer.

In September, the Fed cut the federal\u2011funds target range by 25 basis points to 4.00\u20114.25%, a move that matched market expectations. The research team keeps its earlier forecast that the Fed will make only two additional 25\u2011basis\u2011point cuts before the end of 2026 \u2013 one in December 2025 and another in March 2026 \u2013 bringing the range to 3.5\u20113.75%.

However, if the labor market weakens further, especially with rising unemployment\u2011benefit claims, the Fed might consider a third 25\u2011basis\u2011point cut in October 2025 or larger cuts next year.

The cuts would bring the upper bound of the Fed\u2019s target range to 3.5%. The economists, including Michael Gapen, noted that 'Softer inflation and weakening labor market conditions give the Fed room to move more quickly toward a neutral policy stance.' They anticipate a pause after January to assess inflation, with further cuts in April and July as labor market deterioration continues. Morgan Stanley previously forecasted quarterly 25\u2011basis\u2011point cuts through December 2026, but now projects a quicker pace while maintaining its terminal rate forecast. The economists argue against a larger 50\u2011basis\u2011point cut this month because the unemployment rate remains low and the fed funds rate is already 100 basis points closer to neutral after last year\u2019s one\u2011point cut.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 02:17 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

Economists were almost evenly split on whether a second cut would occur in October or December. Investors are pricing in three cuts this year, as shown by federal\u2011funds futures. Nearly 90% of respondents expect the Fed to issue a post\u2011meeting statement that places greater emphasis on labor\u2011market risks, with the new statement scheduled for September 17 and a press conference by Chair Jerome Powell 30 minutes later. James Knightley, chief international economist at ING, noted that the balance of risks is shifting toward employment: 'The balance of risks surrounding the Fed's dual mandate of price stability and maximum employment are swinging toward one, whereby the jobs market is the bigger concern.' The FOMC had described the labor market as 'solid' after July, but recent data\u2014unemployment at 4.3% in August and a revision of average monthly job growth through March down by roughly half\u2014challenge that view. Powell hinted at a rate cut in his August Jackson Hole speech, citing a 'shifting balance of risks' that could warrant action to prevent rising unemployment. By June 2026, respondents project the upper bound of the federal\u2011funds target range at 3.5%, a full percentage point below the current level. While most see upside risks to both unemployment and inflation, only two of 42 respondents predict a recession in the next 12 months. The survey also suggests that the FOMC may face dissent on the anticipated quarter\u2011point cut, with Governors Michelle Bowman and Christopher Waller likely to vote in favor of a half\u2011point reduction.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 12, 2025 10:43 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!
