Forward guidance in the latest two statements\n\nDecember 2025 meeting (decision released 10 Dec 2025)\n\n\u2022 Action & vote: third consecutive 25 bp cut to 3.50 %-3.75 % by a 9-3 vote, showing the most internal division since 2019 (CNBC; Chase).  \n\u2022 Statement language: added reference to \u201cthe extent and timing of additional adjustments,\u201d replacing the earlier phrase that simply anticipated \u201cadditional adjustments.\u201d Analysts interpreted the tweak as raising the bar for further cuts and signalling a slower pace (CNBC).  \n\u2022 Balance-sheet: the Fed announced renewed Treasury-bill purchases of USD 40 bn beginning two days after the meeting, aimed at keeping reserves \u201cample\u201d (CNBC).  \n\u2022 Powell\u2019s press conference:  \n  \u2013 Characterised the decision as a \u201cclose call\u201d and said policy is now \u201cwithin a broad range of estimates of neutral,\u201d allowing the Committee to \u201cwait and see how the economy evolves.\u201d  \n  \u2013 Emphasised that the main risk has shifted toward weakness in the labour market, while inflation\u2014still above 2 %\u2014is expected to ease as tariff effects fade (Chase).  \n  \u2013 Dismissed the prospect of rate hikes; instead the baseline was an extended pause with maybe \u201cone additional cut by the middle of next year\u201d if the data weaken (Chase).  \n\u2022 Dots/projections: the Summary of Economic Projections showed only one additional 2026 cut, consistent with a shallow easing path (Chase).\n\nBottom line: December\u2019s statement and remarks framed the December cut as \u201cinsurance,\u201d indicated the Fed believes it is near neutral, and signalled that any further easing would be gradual and data-dependent.\n\nJanuary 2026 meeting (decision released 28 Jan 2026)\n\n\u2022 Action & vote: the Committee paused, keeping the range at 3.50 %-3.75 %. Governors Waller and Miran dissented in favour of another cut (Nuveen; Fed press release 28 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 Statement changes:  \n  \u2013 Upgraded its description of the labour market, noting the unemployment rate \u201chas shown some signs of stabilization\u201d and removed explicit reference to \u201cdownside risks to employment,\u201d a hawkish tilt (Nuveen).  \n  \u2013 Described recent economic growth as \u201csolid\u201d (previously \u201cmoderate\u201d), signalling more confidence in activity (Nuveen).  \n\u2022 Chair Powell\u2019s message: reiterated that the Fed is \u201cwell-positioned to determine the extent and timing of additional adjustments,\u201d and stressed that the inflation trajectory will dictate future moves\u2014\u201cif inflation declines later this year, that would be something that tells us that we can loosen policy\u201d (Nuveen).  \n\u2022 Dot plot (unchanged from December): still projects only one 25 bp cut in 2026 (Nuveen).  \n\nBottom line: The January statement reinforced a watch-and-wait stance, but with slightly more upbeat language on growth and employment, implying the hurdle for near-term easing has risen. Future cuts remain possible but will require clearer progress on inflation.\n\n3.  Information sufficiency / remaining gaps\n\n\u2022 The DFEDTARU levels for each regular meeting through 28 Jan 2026 are fully covered by the YCharts series (which reproduces FRED data).  \n\u2022 There were no unscheduled inter-meeting target-range changes in the period, so the meeting list is exhaustive.  \n\u2022 The qualitative guidance from both the December 2025 and January 2026 statements and press conferences has been captured from multiple public sources (CNBC, Chase, Nuveen, Federal Reserve).  \nNo additional data appear necessary to satisfy the original query. If finer detail were needed\u2014such as exact red-line changes in the official statements or the December \u201cdot plot\u201d table\u2014one could consult the official statement PDFs on federalreserve.gov, but those nuances do not alter the summary above.\n\nThe analysis therefore fully addresses the requested history, meeting-by-meeting changes, and the forward-guidance narrative entering 2026.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"DFEDTARU\" query=\"DFEDTARU\">\nFRED Economic Data: Federal Funds Target Range - Upper Limit\nSeries ID: DFEDTARU\nUnits: Percent\nFrequency: Daily, 7-Day\nLatest observation: 3.75 (2026-02-08)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=4.29, min=3.75, max=4.50\n- 5-year: mean=3.47, min=0.25, max=5.50\n- 10-year: mean=2.37, min=0.25, max=5.50\n- All-time: mean=1.49, min=0.25, max=5.50 (since 2008-12-16)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: +0.00 (+0.0%)\n- 3-month change: -0.25 (-6.2%)\n- 6-month change: -0.75 (-16.7%)\n- Year-over-year: 3.75 vs 4.50 (-16.7%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily, 7-Day):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-28,3.75\n2026-01-29,3.75\n2026-01-30,3.75\n2026-01-31,3.75\n2026-02-01,3.75\n2026-02-02,3.75\n2026-02-03,3.75\n2026-02-04,3.75\n2026-02-05,3.75\n2026-02-06,3.75\n2026-02-07,3.75\n2026-02-08,3.75\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
