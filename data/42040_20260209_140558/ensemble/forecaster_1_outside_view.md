## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**
1. **Two-month forward predictions from current level**: Most relevant given we're forecasting March 2026 from Jan 2026 baseline
2. **Monthly changes in the index (2005-2026)**: Captures typical volatility
3. **Post-2020 recovery period (2021-2026)**: Reflects recent structural conditions
4. **Full historical range (1991-2026)**: Too broad, includes reunification effects and different economic regimes

**Selected Reference Class:** Two-month forward changes from similar economic conditions (stagnant/low-growth periods), supplemented by recent monthly volatility patterns.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 2 months (from Jan 2026 to March 2026)

**Recent Monthly Changes (last 6 months):**
- Aug→Sep 2025: -1.3 points
- Sep→Oct 2025: +0.7 points
- Oct→Nov 2025: -0.3 points
- Nov→Dec 2025: -0.5 points
- Dec→Jan 2026: 0.0 points

**Two-month changes (recent examples):**
- Jun→Aug 2025: +0.6 points
- Jul→Sep 2025: -0.9 points
- Aug→Oct 2025: -0.6 points
- Sep→Nov 2025: +0.4 points
- Oct→Dec 2025: -0.8 points
- Nov→Jan 2026: -0.5 points

**Pattern Observations:**
- Recent volatility: ±0.5 to 1.3 points per month
- Two-month changes typically: -1.5 to +1.5 points
- Current level (87.6) is 9.1 points below long-term average (96.71)
- Persistent weakness since mid-2025, hovering 87-89 range

## (d) Justification

The German economy shows "little momentum" per ifo's own assessment. The index has been range-bound between 87.5-89.0 for the past 6 months, suggesting structural headwinds rather than cyclical fluctuation. 

**Factors supporting stability/modest decline:**
- Persistent weakness across most sectors (services deteriorating, manufacturing/trade/construction improving but from very low bases)
- Market expectations consistently above actual (88.1-88.2 vs 87.6), suggesting analysts expect improvement that hasn't materialized
- Two-month horizon is relatively short for major structural shifts

**Factors supporting potential improvement:**
- Manufacturing showing sharp improvement in sentiment
- Trade sector rising sharply
- Mean reversion tendency toward long-term average (96.71) over longer horizons

**Factors supporting potential decline:**
- Services sector deteriorating (key for German economy)
- Capacity utilization falling (77.5% vs 83.2% average)
- Geopolitical/trade tensions mentioned in sources
- Trading Economics model forecasts Q1 2026 at 86.0 (below current)

Given the short timeframe and recent range-bound behavior, I expect March 2026 to remain close to current levels with moderate probability of small moves in either direction.

## Outside View Calibration

**Base Rate:** Jan 2026 = 87.6

**Two-month volatility:** Historical two-month changes suggest ±2 points captures ~80% of outcomes in stable periods, ±3 points captures ~90%.

**Distribution considerations:**
- Median should be near current level (87.6) or slightly lower given persistent weakness
- 10th percentile: significant deterioration scenario (services collapse, external shocks) → ~84.5
- 90th percentile: unexpected improvement (policy stimulus, sentiment shift) → ~90.5
- Must account for unknown unknowns in 6-week period
- Trading Economics forecast (86.0) suggests downside bias

**Calibration checks:**
- Range 84.5-90.5 = 6 points, reasonable for 80% confidence over 2 months
- Allows for 10% probability of moves >3 points in either direction
- Centered slightly below current level reflecting weak momentum
