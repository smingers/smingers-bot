Analysis:
**Target / resolution (paraphrase, <30 words):** Forecast the **Germany Ifo Business Climate Index (points, 2015=100)** for **March 2026**, using the value published by the **Ifo Institute** in its March 2026 release.

### (a) Source analysis (what each says, quality, and what’s fact vs opinion)
1. **Ifo Institute – Jan 26, 2026 release / survey-results pages (official)**  
   - **Facts:** Jan 2026 headline **87.6**; current situation **85.7**; expectations **89.5**; qualitative sector notes (manufacturing up, services down, etc.).  
   - **Opinion (identifiable):** Clemens Fuest: “starting the new year with little momentum.” Wohlrabe: “no clear signs of an upward trend for Q1 2026.”  
   - **Quality/date:** Highest; primary publisher; very relevant.

2. **TradingEconomics (data aggregator, Jan 2026 shown; model forecast)**  
   - **Facts:** Confirms Jan 2026 **87.6**, long-run average ~96.7, historical min/max.  
   - **Opinion/model:** “End of Q1 2026 ~86.0” (econometric/analyst blend; not fully transparent).  
   - **Quality/date:** Good for history/current; forecast is **moderate** reliability.

3. **Reuters-carry / media summaries (e.g., wtvbam; n-tv writeup of Jan ifo; Globalbankingandfinance)**  
   - **Facts:** Repeat Jan 2026 **87.6**, consensus miss, and component moves; mention fiscal package context and tariff uncertainty.  
   - **Opinion (identifiable):** Brzeski (ING), Krämer (Commerzbank), Palmas (CapEco) interpreting drivers and outlook.  
   - **Quality/date:** Medium-high; factual parts credible; useful for framing “inside view” drivers.

4. **AskNews: Sentix investor confidence (Feb 2026 survey, Feb 5–7)**  
   - **Facts:** Eurozone Sentix rose sharply; Germany sub-index improved (~10 points), CEO says recovery phase may have begun.  
   - **Opinion (identifiable):** Sentix CEO Hübner optimistic framing.  
   - **Quality/date:** Moderate; not the same population as ifo (investors vs firms), but timely and directionally informative.

5. **AskNews: NZZ article on orders/exports (Feb 8, 2026)**  
   - **Facts:** Reports **Dec 2025 industrial orders +7.8% m/m** and **exports +4.0%** (as cited from Destatis), plus narrative on fiscal impulse and structural constraints.  
   - **Opinion (identifiable):** DZ Bank / Commerzbank quotes on whether it’s self-sustaining.  
   - **Quality/date:** High-quality journalism; “hard data” is relevant but may not pass through quickly to ifo sentiment.

6. **AskNews: VDMA/machine-building & auto-industry pieces (Feb 4, 2026; AFP/heise/webnachrichten)**  
   - **Facts:** Eurozone demand improving; VDMA expects production +1% in 2026; auto export expectations improved in January.  
   - **Opinion (identifiable):** VDMA economist and ifo sector expert commentary.  
   - **Quality/date:** Moderate; sectoral but plausible mechanism for mild ifo improvement.

7. **AskNews: Handelsblatt on VC climate crash; Sputnik/Eurostat-bankruptcies framing**  
   - **Facts:** VC sentiment drop (narrow sector); bankruptcies up (Eurostat index) and unemployment higher.  
   - **Quality/date:** Handelsblatt high but narrow; Sputnik is **low-trust/agenda risk**—I treat it as weak-to-moderate unless corroborated elsewhere.

### (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
**Strong evidence**
- **Official ifo level Jan 2026 = 87.6 with flat momentum (Dec=Jan)** (primary source). This anchors March strongly near high-80s absent a shock.  
- **Sector breadth in official release:** manufacturing improving but services deteriorating; this “tug-of-war” historically produces small net moves (often ±0.5-ish monthly).

**Moderate evidence**
- **Hard data bounce (orders/exports in Dec)** + **Sentix Feb optimism**: consistent directional signal that Q1 may be “less bad” than late 2025, supporting a *modest* uptick risk by March.  
- **VDMA/auto export expectations:** consistent with manufacturing stabilization; could lift ifo expectations component.

**Weak evidence**
- **Tail narratives:** tariff threats, structural competitiveness decline, bankruptcies/unemployment—real issues, but translating into *March* headline level in a 6–8 week window is uncertain; more useful for downside tail than central shift.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time left:** From **2026-02-09** to March 2026 ifo release (late March) is ~**6–7 weeks**; resolution by **2026-04-01**.  
- **If timeframe halved (~3 weeks):** I would hug the latest known value more tightly (distribution narrows around ~87.6–88.0).  
- **If timeframe doubled (~3 months):** fiscal news / global trade shocks could propagate more; I’d widen tails and allow a clearer drift either toward ~86 or ~90+.

### (d) Justification (how inside view shifts outside view)
**Outside view baseline (given):**  
P10 85.5 / P20 86.3 / P40 87.2 / P60 88.0 / P80 89.2 / P90 90.5.

**Status quo / trend-continue outcome:** Flat at **~87.6** (Dec–Jan unchanged), with small oscillations typical. That alone argues for a median near **87.7–88.0**.

**Adjustments from new information (net effect: small upward nudge + slightly wider upside tail):**
- The **Sentix jump (Feb)** plus **strong Dec orders/exports** are the most notable “green shoots” since the Jan ifo survey. While not determinative, they raise the probability that March ifo edges up (especially via expectations) rather than drifts down to 86.  
- Counterweight: multiple credible voices (ifo/Wohlrabe; Commerzbank/ING) still emphasize **no momentum, uncertainty, slow recovery**, limiting how far March can plausibly rise.

So I shift the center **slightly upward** versus the TradingEconomics Q1=86 narrative, but keep the distribution broad and still consistent with “hesitant recovery.”

Distribution calibration
- I keep the middle close to outside view (high-80s), but:
  - **Lift 60th/80th/90th modestly** (more upside possibility if sentiment follows improving “hard” data and investor mood).
  - **Leave downside meaningful** (services drag / tariff uncertainty can still pull it back toward mid-86s).

Checklist:
1. **Variable & criteria:** March 2026 **Ifo Business Climate Index (points)** as published by Ifo after the March survey.  
2. **Outside view distribution:** (85.5, 86.3, 87.2, 88.0, 89.2, 90.5) at (10,20,40,60,80,90).  
3. **Consistency check:** Implied median ≈ **87.9**; mean ≈ **88.2**; consistent with “flat-to-slightly-up” with modest upside risk.  
4. **Top evidence (each <20 words):**
   - Jan ifo **87.6** and **Dec=Jan flat**: strong anchor.  
   - Services weak offsets manufacturing improvement (ifo sector detail).  
   - **Sentix Feb** jump: optimism rising, may lift expectations.  
   - **Dec orders/exports** surprise: supports modest Q1 stabilization narrative.  
5. **Blind spot:** A sudden, large tariff escalation or financial shock could push March sharply **down** (<85).  
6. **Status quo:** Most likely is “near 87–88”; I keep distribution centered there.  
7. **Technicalities:** Percentiles strictly increasing; units in points; below 100 upper bound.
