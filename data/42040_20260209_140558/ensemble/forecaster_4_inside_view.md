Analysis:
a) Source analysis (chronological, newest first)
1. Sentix Investor Confidence release (Feb 2026, Uzmanpara/CNN Türk). Facts: Germany sub-index up ~10 pts to –6.9, expectations +5.8 pts. Expert quote (Hübner). Quality: independent forward-looking survey, moderate reliability.
2. TradingEconomics page (updated late-Jan 2026). Facts: Jan Ifo = 87.6, model forecast Mar = 86.0. Quality: secondary data vendor; methodology opaque → moderate.
3. Ifo Institute release (26 Jan 2026). Facts: Jan headline 87.6, components, sector details. Primary, high quality.
4. Reuters/Wtvbam/N-tv etc. (26 Jan 2026). Facts reproduced from Ifo. Opinions from bank economists. Quality: secondary, reliable for numbers, moderate for commentary.
5. NZZ & VDMA pieces (4–8 Feb 2026). Facts: Dec industrial orders +7.8 %, machine-building orders flat in ’25, production expected +1 % in ’26. Opinions by economists. Quality: sector-specific, moderate.
6. Other AskNews articles (retail, bankruptcies, FX notes). Contain mostly opinion or tangential data (weak linkage to index). Quality: weak for this forecast.

b) Evidence analysis
Strong:
• The actual latest observation (Jan 2026 = 87.6) – primary source.
Moderate:
• TradingEconomics model (86.0 for Mar) – single model.
• Sentix confidence jump in Feb – independent survey, historically correlated but noisy.
• Dec industrial orders/exports surprise on upside – official data, indirect link.
Weak:
• Articles on bankruptcies, retail woes, FX moves – anecdotal/indirect.

c) Timeframe analysis
Time until target publication ≈ 7 weeks. With such a short horizon, typical monthly swings are 0–2 pts (occasionally 3–4 if shocks hit). Halving the horizon (3.5 weeks) would tighten the distribution ~15 %; doubling (14 weeks) would widen it ~25 %.

d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view median (post-2015) was 92 with wide tails.
Current facts: level already 87.6 and has been drifting down since Oct; no major fiscal, monetary or energy shock expected before March; TE model leans slightly lower; however, leading sentiment (Sentix) improved sharply and industrial data show green shoots.
Net effect: keep most mass near status-quo, modest upward bias versus TE but still well below outside-view center. Compress tails given short horizon but allow 10 % chance of ≥4 pt positive surprise if optimism spreads, and 10 % chance of renewed dip from geopolitical shock/U.S. tariff flare-up.

Distribution calibration
Percentile 10: 82.0   (requires ~-6 pt from Jan – sizeable negative shock)
Percentile 20: 84.5
Percentile 40: 86.5
Percentile 60: 88.5   (slight uptick from Jan = most likely)
Percentile 80: 91.5
Percentile 90: 94.0   (strong rebound scenario, but still below long-run mean)

Checklist:
1. Target: headline Ifo Business Climate Index, March 2026 release, points.
2. Outside-view distribution: median 92, 10–90 range 82-99 (see earlier).
3. Consistency: implied mean ≈ 88; aligns with “slight-improvement” narrative.
4. Key evidence: (i) Jan reading 87.6, (ii) Sentix Feb jump, (iii) TE forecast 86, (iv) industrial orders +7.8 %, (v) structural headwinds commentaries.
5. Blind-spot: Sudden EU-U.S. tariff deal collapse triggers confidence plunge (would push index <80).
6. Status quo bias checked – central estimate only +0.9 pt vs Jan.
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, within 65–100 bound, units correct.
