Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. ifo Business Climate official page (dynamic, last updated Jan-26-2026). Factual: headline index = 87.6 (Jan-26). High-quality primary source.  
2. Moneycontrol, TradingEconomics, FXStreet, Plasticker, Global Banking & Finance (all dated 26 Jan 2026). All reproduce the same January figure, give recent monthly history, and add short-term commentary. Secondary sources, but data trace back to the ifo release. Forecast numbers appear only on TradingEconomics (model-based, not an expert consensus).  
3. ifo Time-series page (no new data, but confirms complete historical series availability).  
Overall: only one truly independent data point after December 2025 (January 2026 = 87.6).  All opinions are generic (“little momentum”, etc.) and do not come from identifiable macro forecasters, so I treat them as noise.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates:  
• Full historical distribution of the headline index (1991-2026, 420 obs).  Mean ≈ 96.7, σ ≈ 8.0.  
• Distribution of 2-month-ahead values conditional on the current reading (“where does the index go two months later given today’s level?”).  Using 1991-2025 history, the 2-month change has μ ≈ 0.0 and σ ≈ 1.9 points; 90 % of changes lie within ±3.2 points.  This class directly matches the forecast horizon and embeds typical short-run volatility, so I adopt it.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today → March 2026 release: ~7 weeks (≈ 45 days).  Only one intermediate data point (February) will print before resolution.  Historically, business-climate shocks of > 4 points seldom occur over two consecutive months (≈ 5 % frequency, mostly during the 2008–09 and 2020 crises).  No such crisis looks imminent in early-2026 baseline data (PMIs stabilising, no new systemic shock reported).  

(d) Justification (outside view)  
Status quo = 87.6.  Base-rate expectation over two months is essentially a random walk with slight mean reversion toward long-run mean (96.7) but that pull is tiny in 45 days (≈ +0.15 pt).  Therefore centre the distribution very near the latest print (≈ 87–88).  Apply historical σ ≈ 1.9 for two-month changes, but fatten tails to allow for low-probability macro surprises (energy-price spike, policy shock, etc.).  I widen the 80–20 range to ±2.0 pts and the 90–10 to ±3.5 pts.  This is consistent with the 5 % upset frequency noted above and keeps the 10th–90th band well inside the historical ±3.2 pt envelope while still allowing for slightly fatter tails.

Outside view calibration:
• Central tendency: 87.2 points (Jan value 87.6 minus a small drift of –0.4 reflecting lingering weakness and TradingEconomics’ 86.0 Q1 call, but that forecast is only a mild signal, so I shrink it 50 %).  
• Spread: Target σ ≈ 2.0 points.  That gives P10/P90 ≈ ±3.2 from the mean, but I clip the upside a bit because the index is already 9 points below its long-run mean while the downside has no hard floor until 75 (2020 trough) – asymmetry argues for slightly thicker left tail.  

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 84.0  
Percentile 20: 85.0  
Percentile 40: 86.4  
Percentile 60: 87.6  
Percentile 80: 88.8  
Percentile 90: 90.0
