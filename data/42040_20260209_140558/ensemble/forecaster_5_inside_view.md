Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. ifo Institute (Jan-26 release, primary) – factual 87.6 reading; highest quality.  
2. TradingEconomics (Feb-26, secondary) – repeats 87.6 and models 86 for Mar-26; methodology opaque but historically reasonable → moderate weight.  
3. Sentix investor-confidence (survey 5-7 Feb 26) – shows clear February up-turn for Germany (-6.9 vs -16.8 prior); good pedigree, independent → moderate–to-strong evidence of improving mood.  
4. Destatis industrial orders (Dec 25 +7.8 % m/m) & export surge – hard data pointing to rebound; strong evidence.  
5. VDMA, Ifo sector notes (early Feb 26) – confirm firmer order books in machinery/auto; moderate evidence.  
6. Reports on rising insolvencies, weak services, lost competitiveness – factual but structural, slow-moving; moderate negative evidence.  
7. Venture-capital climate plunge – niche, anecdotal; weak weight.

(b) Evidence analysis (strength tags)  
+ Industrial orders & exports accelerating (strong)  
+ Sentix leap in Feb expectations (moderate/strong)  
+ Auto & machinery sentiment edging higher (moderate)  
– Services downturn and high bankruptcy trend (moderate)  
– TradingEconomics model still predicts 86 (moderate)  
Overall net tilt: modestly positive relative to January.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days to resolution ≈ 50 (two ifo survey rounds).  Cutting horizon to 25 d would roughly halve expected σ from 2.1 → 1.5 pts; doubling to 100 d would raise σ to ≈3 pts and allow broader macro surprises.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside view (AR(1) history, Jan=87.6) produced μ≈88.9 with σ≈2.1.  
Current evidence suggests the risk of an uptick is a bit higher than of a further slide, yet structural drags cap upside. I:  
• Reduce downside tail slightly (bankruptcy/structural drag keeps 10th around 82).  
• Leave most mass between 85-92, centre the median at 88.5 (half-point above my earlier 88.0).  
• Fat-ten tails for geopolitical/event risk: 10th–90th span 12 pts.  

Distribution calibration
Percentiles (pts):  
10th  = 82.0 – significant negative shock (new tariffs, energy spike).  
20th  = 84.5 – mild further softening/stagnation.  
40th  = 87.0 – February flat, March tiny dip.  
60th  = 89.5 – small rebound on better orders/expectations.  
80th  = 92.0 – clear sentiment improvement on stronger Q1 data.  
90th  = 94.0 – sharp but historically plausible two-month surge (+6.4).

Checklist:  
1. Target = ifo Business Climate Index, March 2026, points.  
2. Base rate used: Jan reading + historical two-month dynamics (μ = 88.9, σ = 2.1).  
3. Implied median ≈ 88.5, mean ≈ 88.7 – consistent with justification.  
4. Key evidence: (i) Jan 87.6 baseline, (ii) industrial orders +7.8 %, (iii) Sentix jump, (iv) services weakness, (v) TE model 86.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden energy-price collapse & policy breakthrough -> index >95. (pushes up).  
6. Status-quo (no change) = 87.6; my distribution leans slightly above it.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, within open 65–100 bounds, correct units.
