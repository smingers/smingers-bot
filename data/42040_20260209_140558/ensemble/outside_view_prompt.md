  - Current situation: remained unchanged
  - Expectations: companies more pessimistic about first half of 2026

- **Survey questions:** Firms assess current business situation ("good", "satisfactorily", or "poor") and expectations for next six months ("more favourable", "unchanged", or "more unfavourable")
- **Calculation:** Balance values are calculated as differences between positive and negative responses, then averaged. Index values are increased by 200 and normalized to base year 2015
- **Range:** Index can fluctuate between -100 and +100
- **Seasonal adjustment:** Uses X-13 ARIMA-SEATS procedure

## Note:
The article appears to be a general information page about the ifo Business Climate Index with some recent data points embedded. The date attribution (August 03, 2022) seems inconsistent with the data presented (which references late 2025/early 2026), suggesting this may be a dynamically updated page or there may be extraction issues with the content.

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide monthly Ifo Business Climate Index for Germany 2005-2026 with summary statistics
The search results confirm that complete, machine-readable time-series for the Germany ifo Business Climate Index exist and can be downloaded free of charge from the ifo Institute itself, as well as from several commercial data re-publishers.  

1. Where the full monthly data are stored  
   • “ifo Time-series | ifo Institute” (ifo Institute) – official Excel workbooks that include the headline Business Climate Index (2015 = 100, seasonally adjusted) back to 1991. This is the primary, authoritative source and is openly accessible once the workbook is downloaded.  
   • YCharts (ycharts.com) – provides the same series (ID: I:GIBCI) in CSV form and explicitly shows the download link. The snippet lists observations for 2022-2026, but YCharts normally mirrors the entire history supplied by the ifo Institute.  
   • TradingEconomics / TradingView / Investing.com – offer interactive charts and short extracts but do not expose an easy “download all” function. They are useful for cross-checking individual observations, but not ideal for compiling 252 monthly numbers.

2. Information already obtained  
   • Monthly values from Jan-2023 to Jan-2026 are visible in the YCharts excerpt (source: YCharts).  
   • The headline January 2026 reading (87.6) and long-run extrema (high 109.8 in Jan-1991, low 75.0 in Apr-2020) have been confirmed by TradingEconomics (source: TradingEconomics).

3. What is still missing to fulfil the user request  
   • The complete set of monthly observations for Jan-2005 – Jan-2026 (inclusive). We currently hold only a 37-month slice.  
   • Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum) calculated on those 253 observations.

4. Recommended next step to close the gap  
   • Download the official workbook from the ifo Institute portal. The file name changes each month, but it is always located at a stable base URL:
     https://www.ifo.de/en/ifo-time-series  →  “Germany: Index (2015 = 100, seasonally adjusted): Business Climate”.  
     Once opened, copy or export the sheet that contains the “Business Climate Index” column; filter the rows from 2005-01 to 2026-01.  
   • Alternatively, click “Download Source File” on YCharts (I:GIBCI) to obtain a CSV that already carries the correct time stamp format.

5. Computation of the requested summary statistics  
   After importing the 2005-01…2026-01 data into any spreadsheet or statistical package:  
     – Mean = AVERAGE(range)  
     – Median = MEDIAN(range)  
     – Standard deviation = STDEV.P(range) or STDEV.S(range)  
     – Minimum = MIN(range)  
     – Maximum = MAX(range)  

6. Validation / cross-checks  
   • Spot-check a few months (e.g., Apr-2020 = 75.0, Jan-2008 = 107.5, Jan-2018 = 102.3) against the TradingEconomics chart to ensure the series has not been shifted or re-based.  
   • Confirm that the index label in the Excel sheet is “ifo Geschäftsklima Deutschland, saisonbereinigt, 2015=100”.  

Conclusion:  
All pieces needed to deliver the complete answer are available, but the bulk of the monthly observations (2005-2021) still have to be downloaded and appended. Once that is done, the list of 253 monthly values plus the five requested summary statistics can be produced exactly as the user specified.

Remaining information gap: the raw monthly numbers for 2005-2021.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
