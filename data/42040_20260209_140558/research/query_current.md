Analysis:
To estimate the March 2026 Ifo Business Climate Index, I first need the most recent actual readings (Dec 2025/Jan 2026) plus any forward-looking commentary from the Ifo Institute or market economists. Equally important are fresh macro reports (PMIs, orders, energy prices, ECB policy) that analysts cite when projecting German business sentiment for the next two months. Therefore, I will search for: 1) the latest index press releases and data tables; 2) news articles featuring economists’ forecasts or interview quotes on where the index is headed in early 2026; 3) in-depth outlook pieces (banks, research houses) explicitly mentioning expected levels for February–March 2026.
