The Expectations Index climbed from 10 to 15.8 points, while the Current Situation Index improved from -13 to -6.8 points, indicating a sustained recovery trend. Sentix emphasized that the data signals a recovery phase in the regional economy, with Germany playing a key role. Germany\u2019s Investor Confidence Index rose approximately 10 points to -6.9, the highest since July 2025, and its Current Situation Index improved from -36 to -27.5. Sentix CEO Manfred H\u00fcbner described the February data as a 'ray of hope' for the Eurozone, stating that a growth phase may have begun, with investors becoming more optimistic about Germany. He noted that the recession in Germany appears to be nearing an end, and low gas storage levels are no longer seen as a major risk factor. Germany recorded 0.3% growth in the final quarter of last year and 0.2% in 2025; government spending on infrastructure and defense is expected to drive growth, with forecasts predicting approximately 1% GDP growth in 2026. The survey was conducted between February 5\u20137, 2026, with participation from 1,091 investors.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 12:13 PM\nSource:[Uzmanpara.com](https://uzmanpara.milliyet.com.tr/uzmanpara/euro-bolgesi-yatirimci-guveni-7-ayin-zirvesinde-7535298)\n\n**Eurozone Investor Confidence Reaches 7-Month High**\nAccording to Sentix data, the Eurozone General Investor Confidence Index rose from -1.8 points in January to 4.2 points in February, a 6-point increase that surpassed the market's expected 1.8-point rise and marked the highest level since July 2025. This improvement reflects growing optimism about the regional economy. The Expectations Index, which measures investors' outlook for the next six months, increased from 10 points in January to 15.8 points in February, indicating a more positive economic outlook. The Current Conditions Index also showed recovery, rising from -13 points in January to -6.8 points in February, signaling improving economic circumstances. Sentix emphasized that Germany\u2019s economy is playing a leading role in this recovery. Germany\u2019s Investor Confidence Index rose nearly 10 points to -6.9, the highest level since July 2025, while the Current Conditions Index improved from -36 to -27.5. Sentix CEO Manfred H\u00fcbner stated that the recovery process in the Eurozone has begun, with investors becoming notably more optimistic about Germany. Concerns over recession are diminishing, with energy supply risks, particularly low gas storage levels, no longer seen as major threats. In 2025, Germany\u2019s economy grew by 0.2%, and in the final quarter of the previous year, it grew by 0.3%. For 2026, expectations are for economic growth of approximately 1%, supported by government investments in infrastructure and defense.

The indicator combines assessments of current business conditions and expectations for the next six months. KfW Chief Economist Dirk Schumacher described the downturn as 'not only surprising but also remarkably strong.' Despite the pessimistic sentiment, the fourth quarter was the second strongest of the year in terms of investment volume, with \u20ac2 billion invested in German startups. Overall, \u20ac7.2 billion was invested in German startups during 2025.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 11:44 AM\nSource:[Handelsblatt](https://www.handelsblatt.com/finanzen/maerkte/investoren-stimmung-bei-wagniskapitalinvestoren-bricht-ein/100197548.html)\n\n**Euro Rises to One-Week High Against US Dollar**\nThe euro strengthened against the US dollar, reaching a one-week high at 1.1826, according to a market analysis published on February 9, 2026, by wallstreet:online. The analysis suggests that after a correction from its September 2025 yearly high, the EUR/USD pair found support near the 100-day moving average and stabilized after the 200-day moving average held at the 1.16 level. A firm weekly close above 1.18 is expected to drive further gains into the coming week. The projected daily range for Monday is 1.1770 to 1.1890, with key resistance levels at 1.1830, 1.1833 (previous week\u2019s high), and 1.1918. Key support levels include 1.1608, 1.1572 (previous week\u2019s low), and 1.1494. For Tuesday, the range is projected as 1.1800 to 1.1900 or alternatively 1.1740 to 1.1850, depending on market reaction. The weekly forecast suggests a potential breakout above the 200-day moving average, with a possible target near 1.22 if the price sustains above the previous year\u2019s high. The projected weekly range is 1.1730 to 1.1980. For the following week, a stabilization above the 20-day moving average could enable stronger recovery, while resistance at 1.19 may prolong trading range. The projected weekly range is 1.1810 to 1.2090 or 1.1640 to 1.1820.

Analysts, including Yaroslav Kabakov, Director of Strategy at investment firm Finam, attribute this surge to the loss of the Russian market following EU sanctions against Russia. The impact was most severe on energy-intensive sectors such as metallurgy and pulp and paper industries, where insolvency and bankruptcy rates in certain segments rose by up to 200%. Concurrently, unemployment in Germany rose from 5.1% of the working-age population in January 2022 to 6.3% by January 2026. Germany, once a major trading partner of Russia and heavily reliant on Russian gas, severed access to Russian energy after the Nord Stream pipelines were destroyed in autumn 2022, forcing a shift to significantly more expensive American energy sources. Russian officials have claimed that the West has failed to acknowledge the ineffectiveness of sanctions, while Western experts have repeatedly questioned their efficacy.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 07:55 AM\nSource:[Sputnik \u041b\u0438\u0442\u0432\u0430](https://lt.sputniknews.ru/20260209/antirossiyskie-sanktsii-es-priveli-k-rostu-bankrotstv-kompaniy-v-germanii-40524060.html)\n\n**More Orders, More Exports \u2013 Is This the Spark for Germany\u2019s Economic Revival?**\nDespite a 24% rise in the German stock market since early 2025, the real GDP grew only 0.2% in the previous year, leading analysts to revise growth forecasts downward. However, recent data from the Federal Statistical Office shows a 7.8% month-on-month increase in industrial orders in December 2025, surpassing all expectations. Exports also rose 4.0% more than anticipated, despite U.S. tariffs and weak demand in China. Analysts interpret this as a potential 'strong impetus' to lift Germany's industry from stagnation, with Michael Holstein of DZ Bank calling it 'the beginning of a self-sustaining recovery.' The European Central Bank\u2019s 2 percentage point rate cut between summer 2024 and summer 2025 and the federal government\u2019s billion-euro infrastructure and defense spending program are seen as key drivers. However, structural challenges remain: high labor and energy costs, excessive bureaucracy, and high taxes continue to depress business and consumer sentiment. The Ifo Business Climate Index stagnated in January after two consecutive declines, and J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer of Commerzbank warns that 'defense contracts alone won't create a recovery.' A letter from Christoph Ahlhaus, head of the Federation of Medium-Sized Enterprises, reveals deep frustration: 64% of companies doubt Chancellor Merz\u2019s promised economic turnaround, and 79% see no genuine government effort. Political fragmentation and broken reform promises reduce the effectiveness of public spending, with the RWI Leibniz Institute estimating that each euro of government expenditure boosts GDP by less than one euro. Without fundamental reforms, the stimulus may only produce a 'weak fire.' Demographic trends further threaten growth: the aging population will outpace net migration, causing labor shortages. The Council of Economic Experts projects Germany\u2019s long-term growth rate will fall from 0.4% to 0.1% by 2030, risking prolonged stagnation. The article questions whether stock markets will anticipate this or follow Paul Samuelson\u2019s observation that they often mispredict economic turning points.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 04:48 PM\nSource:[Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung](https://www.nzz.ch/wirtschaft/mehr-auftraege-mehr-exporte-die-konjunkturdaten-in-deutschland-bessern-sich-kommt-jetzt-der-aufschwung-ld.1924019)\n\n**'If February is dry and cold...' - Farmers' Rules May Forecast 2026 Weather Reality**\nAccording to traditional German farmers' almanacs, weather patterns in February can predict conditions for the coming months, with Candlemas (February 2) holding particular significance. A well-known rule states: 'If February is dry and cold, heat will come soon in March,' suggesting a rapid temperature rise. While the German Weather Service (DWD) confirms that such rules cannot reliably predict weather, they may contain a kernel of truth based on long-term observations. Data from the weather portal donnerwetter.de indicates that if the first week of February is sunnier than average, there is a 70% probability of more frost days in February and March. High-pressure systems at the beginning of February often bring clear skies and prolonged sunny conditions, but this can lead to stronger nighttime cooling, causing temperatures to drop significantly. Another rule from January 31, 'If it freezes on Vigilius, cold will come in March,' aligns with historical weather data, showing a 65% chance of increased frost days in March when January ends cold. These traditions are rooted in agricultural practices and religious customs, with Candlemas historically marking the end of the Christmas season and the return to work after winter. The article notes that while some rules are based on folklore, others have statistical support from long-term meteorological records.

It highlights that the US Federal Reserve is expected to cut interest rates 1\u20132 times, while the European Central Bank (ECB) will likely hold rates steady, and the Bank of Japan may begin monetary normalization, potentially leading to yen appreciation. These divergences are expected to narrow interest rate differentials, particularly impacting USD/JPY, which could range from 146\u2013148 by Q4 2026. The Australian dollar (AUD) is projected to strengthen due to robust global demand for commodities like iron ore and copper, along with a pro-cyclical growth environment. EUR/USD may rise due to Germany\u2019s fiscal stimulus, though French political instability and a widening French-German bond spread (86 basis points) pose risks. The US Dollar Index (DXY) is forecast to decline to the mid-90s by year-end, pressured by Fed rate cuts and reduced safe-haven appeal. Market sentiment, support/resistance levels, and geopolitical tensions are identified as critical factors influencing currency movements. Traders are advised to monitor central bank announcements, economic indicators, and yield curve shifts to capitalize on opportunities in a volatile environment.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 12:00 PM\nSource:[TradersDNA](https://www.tradersdna.com/forex-updates-news/)\n\n**Automotive Industry: European Demand Offers Hope Amid Ongoing Challenges**\nThe German automotive industry shows slightly improved outlooks, according to the Ifo Business Climate Index for January 2026, which rose by 0.2 points to -19.6. The increase was driven by improved business expectations, which rose by 2.8 points, while the current situation was assessed 2.5 points more negatively than in December 2025. Ifo expert Anita W\u00f6lfl stated that demand from the Eurozone is acting as a 'supporting force' for the industry. Export expectations surged from -8 to +8.7 points, with internal EU trade identified as the main driver behind this improvement. Companies in the German auto sector also reported a significant improvement in their competitive position within the EU, rising 13.9 points to +15.4 in net terms. However, outside Europe, the competitive outlook deteriorated sharply, falling 13.9 points to -31.3, with W\u00f6lfl noting increasing competitiveness challenges from China and the United States.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 01:38 PM\nSource:[heise online](https://www.heise.de/news/Autoindustrie-Europaeische-Nachfrage-macht-Hoffnung-11165336.html)\n\n**Stable Orders Lift Spirits in Germany's Machine and Plant Engineering Sector**\nThe German machine and plant engineering sector, which experienced three difficult years, is showing signs of recovery, according to the VDMA trade association. In 2025, after years of declines, real (price-adjusted) orders remained flat compared to the previous year, driven primarily by a 7% increase in orders from the Eurozone. In contrast, domestic orders fell by 1%, and non-Eurozone international orders dropped by 2%, partly due to U.S. tariff policies under President Trump. Positive sentiment is growing, especially in key customer industries like automotive, where the Ifo Business Climate Index rose slightly in January due to improved business expectations. The Ifo expert Anita W\u00f6lfl notes that intra-European trade is now the main driver of growth. Although German automakers have lost competitiveness in markets like China and increasingly in the U.S., the machine and plant engineering industry is becoming more optimistic. VDMA Chief Economist Johannes Gernandt states that signs of a bottoming out are strengthening, particularly due to a 3% real increase in orders in the fourth quarter of 2025, driven by international demand, especially from non-Eurozone countries. This upward trend is expected to boost production in 2026, with the VDMA forecasting a real 1% production increase\u2014reversing a 5% decline projected for 2025. The mood has significantly improved: in January, nearly 30% of 962 surveyed companies rated the current situation as good or very good, up from 23% in October. Conversely, only 24% rated the situation as bad or very bad, down from 33%. Looking ahead, about 57% of companies expect nominal revenue growth (including price increases), 29% anticipate stagnation, and less than 15% foresee a decline. Despite this optimism, Gernandt cautions that political support and reforms are needed to sustain the recovery and enhance competitiveness in Germany and Europe.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 11:29 AM\nSource:[webnachrichten.de](https://www.webnachrichten.de/wirtschaft/stabile-auftraege-hellen-stimmung-im-maschinenbau-auf-zr-94153705.html)\n\n**Survey: German Auto Industry Companies Expect Higher Exports**\nThe mood in German automotive companies has slightly improved, according to the Ifo Institute's business sentiment index, which rose from a seasonally adjusted -19.8 points in December to -19.6 points in January.

Ifo industry expert Anita W\u00f6lfl stated that demand from the Eurozone continues to act as a supporting force for the German auto industry. Companies assessed their competitiveness in EU markets as significantly better, but rated their position on non-European markets as markedly worse. W\u00f6lfl explained that German automakers have lost competitiveness outside Europe since 2024, particularly compared to China, with a growing disadvantage also observed relative to the United States, based on official trade data.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 07:32 AM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/962T8CU)\n\n**Ifo: European Market Boosts Hope for Germany's Auto Industry**\nThe business climate in Germany's automotive industry improved slightly in January, with the sector's index rising by 0.2 points to -19.6, according to the Ifo Institute.

While companies rated their current business situation worse, their outlook for the coming months became less pessimistic. Ifo industry expert Anita W\u00f6lfl noted that demand from the Eurozone continues to act as a supporting force for the German auto industry. Export expectations improved significantly, increasing from -8.0 points in December to +8.7 points in January. W\u00f6lfl attributed this to the driving role of intra-European trade, based on official order data. The industry's competitive position within the EU improved sharply, with the balance rising from 1.5 points in October to 15.4 points in January. However, their competitive position outside Europe deteriorated further, with the balance falling to -31.3 points from -17.4 points in October.

The current business climate is rated as satisfactory by 59.3% of companies (up from 58.4% in October), with 23.6% reporting a poor situation and 17.1% a good one. Future expectations remain negative: 27.3% anticipate a worse business climate (down from 28.0% in October), while only 8.3% expect improvement (down from 19.2%). A stable outlook is expected by 64.4% (up from 52.8%). The Business Climate Index stands at 87.0 points (down from 89.2 in October), remaining below the 100-point threshold for the fourth consecutive year, signaling persistent economic stagnation. In industry, the index dropped to 79.3 points due to pessimistic outlooks, while the trade sector remains at 91.8 points\u2014both in negative territory. Employment plans show a net decline: 22.9% of firms expect job cuts versus 10.2% planning hiring. In industry, 34.1% expect fewer employees and 12.2% more. Among export-oriented firms, 55.9% expect stable exports, 23.5% growth, and 20.6% decline. The top risks cited are deteriorating economic policy conditions (66.1%), declining domestic demand (62.8%), rising labor costs (58.7%), higher energy and raw material prices (47.1%), and skilled labor shortages (37.2%). Regional banks (Sparkasse Fulda and VR Bank Fulda) foresee a largely sideways trend in 2026, with increased risk management discussions. Prof. Dr. Tobias Knedlik of Hochschule Fulda noted global economic conditions remain stable, projected German growth at around 1%, and emphasized the importance of AI use in education for regional future resilience.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 05:48 PM\nSource:[Osthessen News](https://osthessen-news.de/n11788149/flaute-halt-an-diese-erkenntnisse-bringt-das-ihk-konjunkturgesprach.html)\n\n**After a Modest Recovery: Will Consumer Spending Return in 2026?**\nThe German retail sector is undergoing a transformation, with online commerce driving a modest recovery. According to the German Retail Association (HDE), e-commerce revenues rose by 3% in 2025 (price-adjusted) and are projected to grow by 3.5% in 2026. However, a third of this growth is attributed to Asian platforms like Shein and Temu, which face criticism for low product quality, weak oversight, and unfair competition. HDE President Alexander von Preen urges stricter regulation, including the possibility of shutting down non-compliant platforms. Artificial intelligence is also reshaping consumer behavior, with tools like ChatGPT being used for product advice and price comparisons, raising questions about the future of traditional online shopping. Meanwhile, the physical retail sector continues to shrink: the number of retail stores in Germany dropped from 372,000 in 2015 to around 300,000. While chains like Action and Decathlon are expanding, others like Kodi and Depot have closed stores. According to the IFH K\u00f6ln, only 64% of retail sales in core categories (clothing, electronics, home, daily goods) now occur in physical stores. The decline reflects a shift toward non-traditional services\u2014such as repairs, events, courses, and service bookings\u2014indicating that physical stores are losing relevance as pure sales points. IFH CEO Boris Hedde warns that declining store numbers no longer reflect consumer needs, contributing to a growing preference for online shopping. Despite this, consumer sentiment has slightly improved at the start of 2026, driven by rising income expectations and easing inflation fears, according to the HDE Consumer Barometer and NIQ\u2019s Consumer Sentiment Index. The NIM expert Rolf B\u00fcrkl notes that the minimum wage increase likely played a role. Still, optimism among retailers remains limited: 49% of businesses expect worse sales in 2026 compared to 2025, while only 23% anticipate improvement. The HDE forecasts a total retail turnover of approximately 697 billion euros for 2026\u2014just a 0.5% real-terms increase from 2025.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 01:00 PM\nSource:[DIE WELT](https://www.welt.de/newsticker/dpa_nt/infoline_nt/wirtschaft_nt/article69809c76f0e62064809e2199/nach-zartem-aufschwung-kommt-die-kauflaune-2026-zurueck.html)\n\n**Ifo Index Stagnates: 'Economy Without Momentum' Amid U.S. Tariff Threats and Fiscal Hopes**\nThe Ifo Business Climate Index remained unchanged at 87.6 points in January 2026, indicating that German business sentiment stayed subdued despite slight improvements in industrial confidence. While the industrial sector showed signs of recovery, the services sector deteriorated, with tourism and retail experiencing a notable decline in optimism. Ifo President Clemens Fuest stated that the German economy started the year 'without momentum,' and the index failed to meet expectations after two consecutive declines. The lack of positive impulses from foreign trade and lingering uncertainty due to U.S. tariff threats\u2014now seen as geopolitical tools\u2014have dampened confidence. Analysts, including Deka\u2019s Andreas Scheuerle, noted that although a sharp downturn was avoided after the U.S. withdrew its tariff threats, lasting damage remains. The hope for economic revival now rests on federal government reforms and planned large-scale public investments in infrastructure and defense. The Bundesbank forecasts only moderate growth from January to March 2026, with economists projecting around 1% GDP growth for 2026. Both the German Sparkassen and the ZVEI industry association expect 2026 to bring modest growth\u2014around 1% for the economy and 2% for the electrical and digital industry\u2014though officials warn that this growth is fragile and driven by temporary public spending rather than structural reforms. The DSGV\u2019s Ulrich Reuter emphasized that political action is needed to address domestic competitiveness issues, reduce bureaucracy, and accelerate approval processes, while society must also abandon complacency.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 03:24 PM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/wirtschaft/Wirtschaft-ohne-Schwung-US-Zolldrohungen-zeigen-Wirkung-id30286442.html)\n\n**'Zero Result at the Start of the Year': German Economy Begins Year Weakly**\nThe Ifo Business Climate Index for Germany stagnated at 87.6 points in January 2026, failing to rebound after two consecutive declines, according to the Ifo Institute in Munich. Economists had expected an increase to 88.2 points, but the index remained unchanged. While companies assessed their current situation slightly less pessimistically, their outlook for the future worsened. Ifo President Clemens Fuest stated, 'The German economy is starting the year without momentum.' The industrial sector showed slight improvement, but the services sector deteriorated, with tourism experiencing a notable decline. The construction and retail sectors saw minor gains. Ifo's Klaus Wohlrabe emphasized that the services sector prevented an overall improvement in business sentiment. Deka analyst Andreas Scheuerle noted that while the economic downturn was avoided after the U.S. withdrew its tariff threat, lasting uncertainty remains, driven increasingly by geopolitical motives rather than purely economic ones. He stressed that reforms promised by the federal government are now seen as essential and more likely. Jens-Oliver Niklasch of Landesbank Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg described the situation as a 'zero result at the start of the year' and warned of further potential disappointments in upcoming economic data. Commerzbank Chief Economist J\u00f6rg Kr\u00e4mer called the lack of recovery a disappointment, attributing it to ongoing disappointment over the absence of comprehensive reforms. The Bundesbank forecasts only cautious growth from January to March 2026, with stronger momentum expected later in the year due to potential fiscal loosening. Economists project around 1% growth in 2026, driven by increased public spending on infrastructure and defense, though U.S. tariffs and declining international competitiveness continue to hinder German industry.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 11:13 AM\nSource:[Frankfurter Rundschau](https://www.fr.de/wirtschaft/nullnummer-zum-jahresauftakt-deutsche-wirtschaft-startet-schwach-ins-neue-jahr-94139884.html)\n\n**Ifo: Business Climate Index in Germany Stagnates at Start of Year**\nThe Ifo Business Climate Index in Germany remained stagnant at 87.6 points in January 2026, failing to meet the average economist expectation of 88.2 points as reported by Bloomberg. While current economic conditions saw a slight improvement, future expectations declined slightly. Ifo Institute President Clemens Fuest stated, 'The German economy begins the new year without momentum.' The Ifo Institute surveys approximately 9,000 companies monthly and considers the index the most important indicator of economic trends in Germany. Senior economist at Commerzbank, J\u00f6rg Kremmer, noted that after two consecutive declines, a recovery in the Ifo index was expected, but its failure to materialize is 'disappointing.' He attributed the lack of recovery to widespread disappointment among firms over the absence of major structural reforms, adding that 'the economy is likely to recover slowly this year.' The German Central Bank forecasts only modest growth in the first quarter, and economists anticipate a 1% GDP growth in 2026, primarily driven by large-scale government spending on infrastructure and defense. However, high U.S. tariffs remain a restraining factor for German industry.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 10:53 AM\nSource:[\u0633\u0643\u0627\u064a \u0646\u064a\u0648\u0632 \u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.skynewsarabia.com/business/1848699-%D8%A7%D9%95%D9%8A%D9%81%D9%88-%D8%B1%D9%83%D9%88%D8%AF-%D9%85%D9%88%D9%94%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%85%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AE-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%94%D8%B9%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%84-%D8%A7%D9%94%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D8%A8%D8%AF%D8%A7%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%85)\n\n**Ifo Index Stagnates \u2013 'German Economy Starts the Year Without Momentum'**\nThe Ifo Business Climate Index remained unchanged at 87.6 points in January 2026, according to the Ifo Institute in Munich, contrary to economists' expectations of a rise to 88.2 points. The index, based on a survey of approximately 9,000 business leaders, indicates that while companies are slightly less pessimistic about their current situation, their outlook has become marginally less favorable. Ifo President Clemens Fuest stated that 'the German economy is starting the new year without momentum.' The Bundesbank notes that the economy entered the year with low dynamism and is expected to grow only moderately from January to March. However, fiscal policy easing later in the year is projected to provide a boost, driven by increased government spending on infrastructure and defense. Economists forecast around 1% economic growth for 2026, though this progress is being hindered by U.S. tariffs and a weakening international competitive position in German industry.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 09:23 AM\nSource:[onvista.de](https://www.onvista.de/news/2026/01-26-ifo-index-stagniert-wirtschaft-startet-ohne-schwung-ins-neue-jahr-0-20-26472460)\n\n**German Business Confidence Falls to Seven-Month Low in December**\nThe sentiment of German business leaders deteriorated in December, falling to its lowest level in seven months, signaling concern to the government whose economic recovery policies have failed to reassure. The Ifo business climate index dropped to 87.6 points in December, a 0.4-point decline from November, which had shown a temporary rebound. Expectations for the next six months weakened significantly, while current conditions remained unchanged. Clemens F\u00fcst, president of Ifo, stated that 'the year ends without any momentum for recovery' for Germany's economy, which experienced two consecutive years of recession in 2023 and 2024 and is expected to nearly stagnate in 2025. Pessimism increased across all sectors, including manufacturing, which faces a fourth consecutive year of decline, and services and trade. Jens-Oliver Niklasch, economist at LBBW, noted that 'the signals coming from Berlin likely play an important role\u2014the government's policies are not delivering on promises and sometimes lag behind reality.' Business circles, especially the industrial lobby, remain dissatisfied with the coalition government led by Friedrich Merz, which began in May. The government has prioritized public infrastructure and defense investments, relaxed debt constraints, and introduced tax and social reforms. Berlin is also awaiting EU approval for a 2026 electricity price reduction benefiting energy-intensive industries. These measures are expected to boost economic activity. Niklasch added that 'most forecasts for 2026 anticipate a recovery, slightly improved by a positive calendar effect.' The German Federal Bank will release a new 2026 economic forecast on Friday, projecting a rebound of 0.7%, compared to 0.9% by the IMF and around 1% by German institutions.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 17, 2025 01:23 PM\nSource:[Boursorama](https://www.boursorama.com/actualite-economique/actualites/le-moral-des-entrepreneurs-allemands-baisse-en-decembre-au-plus-bas-depuis-sept-mois-036459062ae062b9f000f80018aa07dd)\n\n**Germany's Business Confidence Deteriorates by Year-End, Marking a Disappointing Close to 2025**\nThe Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich released the results of its December 2025 German Business Survey, which included responses from approximately 9,000 companies. The Ifo Business Climate Index fell to 87.6 points in December, down from 88.0 points in November, marking the second consecutive monthly decline after a six-month upward trend that had been interrupted in September and resumed in October. The decline was driven by a significant deterioration in business expectations, with the Ifo Expectations Index dropping from 91.6 to 90.5 points, while the Current Assessment Index rose slightly from 85.3 to 85.6 points. Manufacturing sector expectations worsened, with companies reporting declining new orders and plans to reduce production. Construction sector confidence remained low. Retailers expressed dissatisfaction with holiday sales, and outlooks for the first half of 2026 were described as pessimistic. Ifo President Clemens Fuest stated that expectations had 'significantly deteriorated,' noting that businesses are becoming increasingly pessimistic about the first half of 2026, while current conditions remain unchanged. LBBW Bank Economist Jens-Oliver Niklasch described the economic outlook as still 'gloomy' heading into year-end, attributing the renewed drop in confidence to political signals from Berlin, stating that 'politicians are not delivering on promises and sometimes act detached from reality.' Hauck Aufhauser Lampe Privatbank Chief Economist Alexander Kr\u00fcger criticized the lack of a real economic policy, saying that hopes are now tied solely to government spending plans, and warned that without real investment, the impact would be temporary, likening the mood to 'a barley soup instead of a holiday feast.' ING Global Macro Research Head and Germany Chief Economist Carsten Brzeski noted that the Ifo Business Climate Index reached its lowest level since May 2025, stating that '2025 ended with a disappointing Ifo index, just as it began.' He emphasized that after years of denial, policymakers have finally acknowledged the end of good economic times, but doubts remain over structural reforms and creative budgeting. Despite a temporary boost from the U-turn in fiscal stimulus and the new coalition agreement, a new national depression period began in the second half of the year. Brzeski added that only two quarters since late 2022 had seen genuine economic growth, but he noted there is sufficient evidence that Germany's economy will overcome stagnation in 2026.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: December 17, 2025 11:27 AM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/tr/ekonomi/alman-is-dunyasinin-ekonomiye-guveni-yil-sonunda-kotulesti/3773645)\n\n**Expectations for German Suppliers Turn Positive for the First Time Since March 2022**\nThe seasonally adjusted ifo business climate index for German suppliers improved in November, rising by 2.5 points to -7.7\u2014the best level in over two years. This marks a continuation of the moderate recovery seen in recent months, though the index remains well below the normal economic range. The current assessment improved by 2.7 points to -15.9, yet the sentiment remains negative, with only 14% of suppliers reporting a 'good' business situation. Structural challenges continue to shape the operating environment. Notably, expectations rose by 2.3 points from -1.4 to +0.9\u2014the first time since March 2022 that the expectation component entered positive territory. Despite this positive signal, outlooks for the first half of 2026 suggest no fundamental recovery, with expectations of continued poor conditions. The structural reform needs remain significant, driven by weak order intake in key customer industries, insufficient announcements on industrial electricity prices, and rising wage-related costs. The index is calculated by the Arbeitsgemeinschaft Zulieferindustrie (ArGeZ) in collaboration with the Ifo Institute, based on surveys of approximately 600 companies across sectors including foundries, aluminum, plastics, steel and metal processing, non-ferrous metals, rubber, and technical textiles. The data, available for download at www.argez.de, reflects the interests of around 9,000 medium-sized suppliers representing about one million employees and \u20ac244 billion in annual revenue. The index is published by the ArGeZ, supported by major industry associations.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 08:20 AM\nSource:[pressebox.de](https://www.pressebox.de/pressemitteilung/bdg-bundesverband-der-deutschen-giesserei-industrie-duesseldorf/erwartungen-erstmals-wieder-mit-positivem-saldo/boxid/1276053)\n\n**Ifo Business Climate Index Improves in October Amid Economic Uncertainty**\nThe Ifo Business Climate Index in Germany rose to 88.4 points in October, up from 87.7 in September, surpassing the Reuters-poll forecast of 88.0. The increase was driven by improved expectations for the coming months, although the current business situation was assessed slightly worse. Ifo President Clemens Fuest stated that German businesses continue to hope for an economic recovery in the coming year. Meanwhile, the S&P Global Purchasing Managers' Index for the private sector rose by 1.8 points to 53.8, marking the fifth consecutive month above the 50-point growth threshold\u2014its highest level in nearly two and a half years. Despite this positive trend, the Bundesbank and Reuters-forecasted economists expect stagnation in GDP growth for the third quarter (July\u2013September 2025), following a 0.3% contraction in the second quarter. Fuest recently warned of a potential economic downturn, calling the situation 'dramatic,' and urged the federal government to present a comprehensive reform package by early 2026, exceeding the scope of the current coalition agreement.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 09:19 AM\nSource:[Handelsblatt](https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/konjunktur/konjunktur-ifo-geschaeftsklima-hellt-sich-auf/100168467.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
