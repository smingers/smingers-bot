Index values are increased by 200 and normalized to base year 2015\n- **Range:** Index can fluctuate between -100 and +100\n- **Seasonal adjustment:** Uses X-13 ARIMA-SEATS procedure\n\n## Note:\nThe article appears to be a general information page about the ifo Business Climate Index with some recent data points embedded. The date attribution (August 03, 2022) seems inconsistent with the data presented (which references late 2025/early 2026), suggesting this may be a dynamically updated page or there may be extraction issues with the content.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.moneycontrol.com/economic-calendar/germany-ifo-business-climate/100\">\n# Summary of Article on Germany's Ifo Business Climate Index\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**January 2026 Data:**\n- The Ifo Business Climate Index remained unchanged at **87.6 points** in January 2026\n- This was below market expectations of 88.1\n- The index is near its lowest level since May 2025\n- Current situation assessment: 85.7 (up from 85.6 in December)\n- Expectations component: 89.5 (down from 89.7 in December)\n\n**Sectoral Breakdown (January 2026):**\n- Services: -2.6 (deteriorated from -2.1)\n- Manufacturing: -12.2 (improved from -14.6)\n- Trade: -21.1 (improved from -24.6)\n- Construction: -14.2 (improved from -14.9)\n\n**Historical Range:**\n- Highest: 109.8 points\n- Lowest: 75 points\n- Period covered: 1991-2026\n- Index base: 2015=100, seasonally adjusted\n\n**Recent Historical Data (Monthly readings):**\n- December 2025: 87.6 (consensus was 88.2)\n- November 2025: 88.1 (consensus was 88.5)\n- October 2025: 88.4 (consensus was 88.0)\n- September 2025: 87.7 (consensus was 89.3)\n- August 2025: 89.0 (consensus was 88.6)\n- July 2025: 88.6 (consensus was 89.0)\n- June 2025: 88.4 (consensus was 88.2)\n- May 2025: 87.5 (consensus was 87.4)\n- April 2025: 86.9 (consensus was 85.2)\n\n**Interpretation (from article):**\nThe unchanged reading suggests \"Europe's largest economy is starting the year with little momentum.\"\n\n---\n\n*Note: The article primarily contains data tables and does not include named expert opinions or forecasts for future periods, including March 2026.*\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/germany/business-confidence\">\n# Summary of Germany Ifo Business Climate Index Article\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**January 2026 Data:**\n- Ifo Business Climate Index: 87.6 points (unchanged from previous month)\n- This represents near the lowest level since May 2025\n- Market expectations were 88.1 points (actual came in below expectations)\n- Current situation assessment: 85.7 (up from 85.6)\n- Expectations component: 89.5 (down from 89.7)\n\n**Sectoral Breakdown:**\n- Services: -2.6 (deteriorated from -2.1)\n- Manufacturing: -12.2 (improved from -14.6)\n- Trade: -21.1 (improved from -24.6)\n- Construction: -14.2 (improved from -14.9)\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Long-term average (1991-2026): 96.71 points\n- All-time high: 109.80 points (January 1991)\n- Record low: 75.00 points (April 2020)\n\n## Forecasts/Projections:\n\n**From Trading Economics global macro models and analyst expectations:**\n- End of Q1 2026 forecast: 86.00 points\n- 2027 projection: trend around 91.00 points\n- 2028 projection: trend around 95.00 points\n\n## Qualitative Assessment:\nThe article characterizes the January 2026 reading as suggesting \"Europe's largest economy is starting the year with little momentum.\"\n\n---\n*Note: The forecasts cited are attributed to \"Trading Economics global macro models and analysts expectations\" but no specific named analysts or institutions are identified beyond Trading Economics itself.*\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.ifo.de/en/ifo-time-series\">\n## Summary of Article\n\n**Source:** ifo Institute - ifo Time-series page\n\n**Article Type:** Data repository description\n\n**Key Information:**\n\nThis page describes the ifo Institute's business survey data offerings rather than providing current index values or forecasts.

Where the full monthly data are stored  \n   \u2022 \u201cifo Time-series | ifo Institute\u201d (ifo Institute) \u2013 official Excel workbooks that include the headline Business Climate Index (2015 = 100, seasonally adjusted) back to 1991. This is the primary, authoritative source and is openly accessible once the workbook is downloaded.  \n   \u2022 YCharts (ycharts.com) \u2013 provides the same series (ID: I:GIBCI) in CSV form and explicitly shows the download link. The snippet lists observations for 2022-2026, but YCharts normally mirrors the entire history supplied by the ifo Institute.  \n   \u2022 TradingEconomics / TradingView / Investing.com \u2013 offer interactive charts and short extracts but do not expose an easy \u201cdownload all\u201d function. They are useful for cross-checking individual observations, but not ideal for compiling 252 monthly numbers.\n\n2. Information already obtained  \n   \u2022 Monthly values from Jan-2023 to Jan-2026 are visible in the YCharts excerpt (source: YCharts).  \n   \u2022 The headline January 2026 reading (87.6) and long-run extrema (high 109.8 in Jan-1991, low 75.0 in Apr-2020) have been confirmed by TradingEconomics (source: TradingEconomics).\n\n3. What is still missing to fulfil the user request  \n   \u2022 The complete set of monthly observations for Jan-2005 \u2013 Jan-2026 (inclusive). We currently hold only a 37-month slice.  \n   \u2022 Summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum) calculated on those 253 observations.\n\n4. Recommended next step to close the gap  \n   \u2022 Download the official workbook from the ifo Institute portal. The file name changes each month, but it is always located at a stable base URL:\n     https://www.ifo.de/en/ifo-time-series  \u2192  \u201cGermany: Index (2015 = 100, seasonally adjusted): Business Climate\u201d.  \n     Once opened, copy or export the sheet that contains the \u201cBusiness Climate Index\u201d column; filter the rows from 2005-01 to 2026-01.  \n   \u2022 Alternatively, click \u201cDownload Source File\u201d on YCharts (I:GIBCI) to obtain a CSV that already carries the correct time stamp format.\n\n5. Computation of the requested summary statistics  \n   After importing the 2005-01\u20262026-01 data into any spreadsheet or statistical package:  \n     \u2013 Mean = AVERAGE(range)  \n     \u2013 Median = MEDIAN(range)  \n     \u2013 Standard deviation = STDEV.P(range) or STDEV.S(range)  \n     \u2013 Minimum = MIN(range)  \n     \u2013 Maximum = MAX(range)  \n\n6. Validation / cross-checks  \n   \u2022 Spot-check a few months (e.g., Apr-2020 = 75.0, Jan-2008 = 107.5, Jan-2018 = 102.3) against the TradingEconomics chart to ensure the series has not been shifted or re-based.  \n   \u2022 Confirm that the index label in the Excel sheet is \u201cifo Gesch\u00e4ftsklima Deutschland, saisonbereinigt, 2015=100\u201d.  \n\nConclusion:  \nAll pieces needed to deliver the complete answer are available, but the bulk of the monthly observations (2005-2021) still have to be downloaded and appended. Once that is done, the list of 253 monthly values plus the five requested summary statistics can be produced exactly as the user specified.\n\nRemaining information gap: the raw monthly numbers for 2005-2021.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData query=\"Germany Ifo Business Climate Index\">\nNo matching FRED series found for \"Germany Ifo Business Climate Index\".\n</FREDData>\n"
