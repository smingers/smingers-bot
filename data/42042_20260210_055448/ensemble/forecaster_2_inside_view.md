Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Data Sources:**
1. **BLS/FRED data (Jan 2026)**: December 2025 U-3 = 4.4%. Highest quality, official government statistics. This is factual, not opinion.

2. **Trading Economics (Feb 2026)**: Reports Dec-2025 U-3 = 4.4%, forecasts Q1-2026 end at 4.50%. Model-based forecast from aggregator; moderate quality for directional guidance.

**Expert Forecasts:**
3. **KPMG Economic Compass (Jan 2026)**: Forecasts unemployment "should stabilize in the 4.5% range in 2026." Named expert source (KPMG economists), moderate-strong quality.

4. **JPMorgan (Dec 10, 2025)**: Michael Feroli (Chief U.S. Economist) forecasts peak unemployment at 4.5% in "early 2026." Strong quality - named expert with clear institutional backing.

5. **Indeed Hiring Lab (Nov 20, 2025)**: Three scenarios for end-2026: upside 4.1%, consensus (mid-range, ~4.4% implied), downside 4.8%. Named experts (Allison Shrivastava et al.), methodology disclosed (Blue Chip GDP-based). Strong quality.

6. **RSM US (2026 outlook)**: Joe Brusuelas (Chief Economist) baseline 4.5% unemployment with risk of moving higher; optimistic 4.3%, adverse 5.0%+. Strong quality - named expert.

7. **Goldman Sachs (Feb 9, 2026)**: Forecasts Jan-2026 unemployment unchanged at 4.4%, possibly rounding to 4.3%. Very recent, named institution, strong quality.

**News Articles (Feb 9-10, 2026):**
8. **Multiple sources on Jan-2026 jobs report**: Expected Jan payrolls +44k-70k, unemployment steady at 4.4%. Consensus forecast aggregation, moderate quality for near-term baseline.

9. **Kevin Hassett/NEC (Feb 9, 2026)**: States lower job growth expected but "not economic weakness" due to productivity gains. Opinion from administration official; directional signal but politically colored.

**Key Factual Evidence:**
- Dec-2025 U-3 = 4.4% (confirmed, high quality)
- Nov-2025 U-3 = 4.5% (revised from 4.6%)
- Initial claims ~200k-236k range (low by historical standards, indicating "low-fire" environment)
- Payroll growth slowed to ~50k/month average in 2025
- Benchmark revision expected: ~900k jobs overcounted in 2024-2025 period

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Multiple independent expert forecasts converge on 4.3-4.6% range for Q1-2026**: JPMorgan (4.5% early-2026), KPMG (4.5% range), RSM baseline (4.5%), Indeed consensus (~4.4%), Goldman (4.4% for Jan). This tight clustering from diverse, credible sources is strong evidence for stability near current levels.

2. **"Low-hire, low-fire" labor market characterization**: Confirmed across JPMorgan, Goldman Sachs, news reports. Initial claims remain subdued (200k-236k), indicating minimal layoff pressure. This structural pattern supports mean-reversion around 4.4%.

3. **Current level anchoring**: Dec-2025 = 4.4%, with Jan-2026 consensus also 4.4%. Two-month horizon from Jan→March means strong autocorrelation; absent shock, rate should stay close.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Payroll growth weakness (~50k/month)**: Suggests labor demand cooling but not collapsing. Historically, this pace is consistent with 0.0 to +0.2pp drift in unemployment over 2 months, not sharp increases.

2. **Immigration restrictions reducing labor supply**: Multiple sources cite this as dampening labor force growth, which arithmetically lowers the "breakeven" job growth needed to hold unemployment steady (from 50k to 15k/month per JPMorgan). This could prevent unemployment from rising despite weak hiring.

3. **Recession probability ~30-33%**: RSM and JPMorgan cite this for full-year 2026, but timing likely later than Q1. Moderate downside risk, not imminent.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **AI productivity gains**: Hassett and others cite this, but impact on March unemployment is speculative and indirect.

2. **Fiscal stimulus expectations**: Mentioned by KPMG/RSM but timing and magnitude uncertain; unlikely to materially affect March reading.

3. **Consumer sentiment weakness**: Noted but indirect link to March U-3.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction horizon**: ~50 days from Feb 10, 2026 to April 3, 2026 BLS release (covering March survey week ~mid-March). This is a **very short timeframe** - essentially 1.5 months.

**If timeframe halved (to ~3 weeks, Feb-2026 reading)**: Would predict even tighter distribution around 4.4%, likely 4.3-4.5% for 80% interval. Extremely high autocorrelation over one month.

**If timeframe doubled (to ~3 months, May-2026 reading)**: Would widen distribution to 4.2-4.7% for 80% interval, incorporating greater uncertainty about recession timing, policy impacts, and seasonal employment patterns (spring hiring).

The short timeframe strongly favors status quo (4.4%) with modest variance.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view baseline**: Centered at 4.4%, 80% interval 4.2-4.6%, 10th-90th range 4.1-4.9%.

**Adjustments based on current evidence:**

1. **Tighten upper tail slightly (90th: 4.9%→4.8%)**: Expert consensus shows no credible forecast above 4.8% for Q1-2026. RSM's "adverse scenario" is 5.0%+ but assigned only 30% probability for full-year, not Q1. The outside view's 4.9% 90th percentile was conservative; current evidence suggests 4.8% is more realistic for a high-side surprise.

2. **Maintain lower tail at 4.1% (10th percentile)**: RSM optimistic scenario (4.3%) and Indeed upside (4.1%) bracket this. Goldman noted potential for 4.3% rounding from 4.38%. Lower tail remains plausible if labor force contracts or hiring accelerates modestly.

3. **Slightly increase probability mass at 4.4-4.5%**: The overwhelming expert consensus (JPMorgan, KPMG, Goldman, consensus forecasts) points to stability in this range. The "low-hire, low-fire" characterization and subdued claims data support minimal movement from Dec-2025's 4.4%.

4. **Maintain central tendency**: No evidence of structural break or shock that would justify large deviation from 4.4%. Immigration restrictions and weak hiring are offset by reduced labor force growth (lower breakeven employment).

**Key insight**: Current circumstances are **highly analogous** to the reference class (late-cycle, non-recession plateaus). The tight expert consensus and short timeframe justify only minor adjustments from the outside view, primarily tightening the upper tail.

## Distribution Calibration

**Central tendency**: 4.4% remains the modal outcome. Jan-2026 expected at 4.4%, March is 2 months later with no major shocks anticipated.

**Lower tail (10th-20th percentiles)**: Set at 4.1-4.2%. Requires either:
- Labor force contraction (immigration effects)
- Modest hiring acceleration (fiscal stimulus, uncertainty resolution)
- Statistical rounding from 4.38% to 4.3%

Probability ~20% based on RSM optimistic scenario weight and Indeed upside case.

**Central range (40th-60th percentiles)**: 4.3-4.5%. This captures:
- Status quo continuation (4.4%)
- Slight drift up to 4.5% (JPMorgan, KPMG baseline)
- Slight drift down to 4.3% (Goldman rounding scenario)

Probability ~40% for this range.

**Upper tail (80th-90th percentiles)**: 4.6-4.8%. Requires:
- Payroll growth remaining weak (~50k/month) with labor force growth resuming
- Early signs of recession (30% full-year probability, front-loaded risk)
- Benchmark revisions revealing weaker underlying trend

Probability ~20% based on RSM baseline "risk of moving higher" and Indeed downside scenario.

**Extreme tail (>4.8%)**: Very low probability (<10%). Would require recession onset in Q1, which experts assign <15% probability. No current evidence of financial shock or mass layoffs.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Seasonally adjusted U-3 unemployment rate (%) for March 2026, from BLS series LNS14000000, released by May 1, 2026.
   ✓ Analysis aligns with this exact target.

2. **Base rate**: Outside view centered at 4.4%, 80% interval 4.2-4.6%, 10th-90th 4.1-4.9%.
   ✓ Final prediction maintains this structure with minor upper-tail tightening based on expert consensus.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 4.4%; mean ≈ 4.42%. This aligns with "low-hire, low-fire" stability near current level with slight upside skew from recession risk.

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - Dec-2025 U-3 = 4.4% (factual, high quality)
   - Expert consensus (JPMorgan, KPMG, Goldman, RSM) clusters 4.3-4.5% for Q1-2026 (strong)
   - "Low-hire, low-fire" environment with subdued claims (strong)
   - Immigration restrictions lowering breakeven employment (moderate)
   - 30% recession probability for 2026, timing uncertain (moderate)
   ✓ All verified from named sources; forecast hinges on credible evidence.

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Sudden financial shock (e.g., credit event, tariff escalation triggering corporate distress) in Feb-March causing mass layoffs. This would push unemployment **up** sharply, potentially to 4.8-5.2%. Probability <10% but would make forecast look overly optimistic.

6. **Status quo**: Current 4.4% is very recent (Dec-2025). Short timeframe (50 days) and low volatility environment favor minimal change. Prediction appropriately centers on 4.4% with modest variance.

7. **Technicalities**: 
   ✓ Percentiles strictly increasing
   ✓ Units in % as requested
   ✓ Values within 0.0-10.0 bounds (closed lower, open upper)
