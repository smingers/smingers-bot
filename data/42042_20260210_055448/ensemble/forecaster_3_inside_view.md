Analysis:
**1) Target / resolution criteria (paraphrase)**  
Forecast the **seasonally adjusted U-3 unemployment rate (%) for March 2026** as it appears on BLS series **LNS14000000**, posted before **May 1, 2026**.

## (a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; date)
- **BLS / FRED (implied via summaries; primary series LNS14000000):**  
  *Fact:* Latest cited reading is **4.4% (Dec 2025)** and **4.5% (Nov 2025)**. This is the definitive measurement concept for resolution. *Quality:* Very high (primary). *Date:* Through Dec 2025; March 2026 is future.

- **EconomicGreenfield (Jan 9, 2026):**  
  *Fact:* Snapshot charts show U-3 **4.4%** (and U-6 8.4%) as of early Jan access. *Opinion/forecast:* none. *Quality:* Medium for interpretation, but cites reliable data. *Date:* Jan 2026.

- **Trading Economics (updated Feb 2026):**  
  *Fact:* Repeats Dec 2025 at **4.4%**.  
  *Model-based forecast:* **end of Q1 2026 = 4.50%**. *Quality:* Medium (useful anchor; not transparent like a full forecast memo). *Date:* Feb 2026.

- **KPMG “Two Faces…” (Jan 2026):**  
  *Forecast/opinion (named institution):* unemployment **stabilizes in the 4.5% range in 2026**. Provides mechanisms (tariffs/immigration uncertainty, AI hiring freezes, etc.). *Quality:* High as an identifiable institutional forecast; still broad (annual). *Date:* Jan 2026.

- **RSM outlook (2026 outlook):**  
  *Forecast distribution:* baseline **~4.5%**, optimistic **~4.3%**, adverse **≥5%** (with probabilities attached in the summary). *Quality:* High (named chief economist; scenario framing is useful). *Date:* 2026 outlook (recent).

- **JPMorgan (Dec 10, 2025):**  
  *Forecast (named chief US economist):* **peak ~4.5% in early 2026**, then improvement later. *Quality:* High. *Date:* Dec 2025.

- **Indeed Hiring Lab (Nov 20, 2025):**  
  *Scenario range for end-2026:* **4.1% to 4.8%** (year-end, not March). *Quality:* Medium-high (structured scenarios; but farther horizon than target month). *Date:* Nov 2025.

- **AskNews items (Feb 9–10, 2026; Investopedia, Bloomberg-style writeups, TheStreet, etc.):**  
  *Facts:* Market consensus for the **upcoming Jan jobs report** is ~**4.4%** unemployment; discussion of **large benchmark payroll revisions**; JOLTS openings down (~6.5m); claims around ~200k; layoff announcements elevated.  
  *Quality:* Medium for the factual “consensus expectations” and reported indicators; weaker for interpretive claims. *Date:* Very recent (Feb 2026).  
  *Important:* Payroll benchmark revisions are repeatedly noted as large, but **they do not directly revise U-3** (household survey), so they’re more of a *signal* than a mechanical driver.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
**Strong evidence (meaningful pull on forecast)**
1. **Near-term professional clustering around 4.4–4.5 for early 2026 (JPMorgan peak 4.5 early 2026; TE Q1 4.5; KPMG stabilizes ~4.5; RSM baseline 4.5).**  
   Multiple identifiable forecasters point to a similar early-2026 level ⇒ supports a center near **4.5** rather than drifting back to 4.2 quickly.

2. **Status quo / inertia:** U-3 is **4.4% as of Dec 2025**, and consensus expects **Jan 2026 ~4.4%**. With only ~2 months to March reference month, large moves are historically uncommon without a shock.

**Moderate evidence (nudges distribution / tails)**
1. **Leading indicators show “low-hire, low-fire” but weakening demand:** falling job openings, slower payroll gains, longer job searches in narrative coverage. This supports a **slight upward drift risk** into March (e.g., 4.5–4.7), though not a rapid spike absent a recessionary break.
2. **Layoff announcements & “revision” narrative:** While payroll benchmark revisions don’t change U-3, the broader picture suggests labor demand may be softer than previously believed, increasing upside risk modestly.

**Weak evidence (small adjustments only)**
1. **Consumer expectations / sentiment surveys** (NY Fed expectations): mixed and noisy; weak mapping to the exact March U-3 print.
2. **Weekly claims fluctuations** around 200k: informative but volatile; currently consistent with stability, not a sharp deterioration.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time until outcome month (March 2026):** ~7 weeks from today (Feb 10) to the March reference month; the data will be published in early April.  
- **If timeframe were halved (forecasting Feb 2026 instead of March):** I’d tighten around **4.4–4.5** with thinner tails.  
- **If timeframe were doubled (forecasting May/June 2026):** I’d widen and tilt slightly higher because slow-hiring regimes can drift up over quarters if growth is “uncomfortably slow.”

## (d) Justification (inside-view adjustment vs outside view)
**Outside view base rate** had a center around **4.4–4.5** with 90th about **4.7**. Since that was built largely on Dec 2025 level and typical short-horizon volatility, I only adjust modestly.

**Why shift slightly upward / widen the upper tail?**
- The freshest reporting (Feb 2026) stresses **weak hiring**, **low openings**, and the risk that labor market softness is more real than previously measured (even if U-3 isn’t revised mechanically).  
- Several credible forecasters already place early-2026 around **4.5%** (not 4.3%).  
- However, **claims remain low** and “low-fire” dynamics reduce the probability of a sudden jump by March.

**Net effect:** keep the median near **4.5**, keep lower tail similar, but raise the upper tail a touch (to 4.8 at the 90th) to reflect a non-trivial risk of further softening by March.

Distribution calibration
- **Status quo / trend-continues outcome:** ~**4.4–4.5** (flat to slight uptick).  
- **Central estimate (median-ish):** **4.5**.  
- **Downside (lower unemployment) path:** participation falls / labor supply tightens further + hiring stabilizes ⇒ **~4.1–4.3**.  
- **Upside (higher unemployment) path:** layoffs broaden beyond pockets + hiring remains very weak ⇒ **~4.7–4.8** by March.  
- I am *not* forecasting recession-level deterioration by March; that would require a clear, abrupt shock not yet evidenced in claims/U-3.

Checklist:
1. **Target variable:** March 2026 SA U-3 unemployment rate (%) on BLS LNS14000000 before May 1, 2026.  
2. **Outside view distribution:** P10 4.1, P20 4.2, P40 4.4, P60 4.5, P80 4.6, P90 4.7.  
3. **Consistency check:** implied median ≈ 4.45–4.50; mean ≈ 4.52. Plausible given status quo 4.4 and expert anchors ~4.5.  
4. **Key evidence (most important):**
   - Dec 2025 U-3 = **4.4%** (BLS/primary).  
   - Multiple credible forecasts put early/Q1 2026 around **4.5%** (JPMorgan/TE/KPMG/RSM).  
   - Leading indicators: openings down, hiring weak; but claims still low (stability with mild deterioration risk).  
5. **Blind spot:** a sudden negative shock (financial accident/policy shock) causing layoffs to surge—would push outcome **up** (≥4.9).  
6. **Status quo:** favors **4.4–4.5**; I keep distribution centered there.  
7. **Technicalities:** percentiles strictly increasing; units are %; values within 0–10.
