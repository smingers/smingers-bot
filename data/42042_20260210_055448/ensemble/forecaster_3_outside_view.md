Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; date; fact vs opinion)

1. **BLS time series page (LNS14000000) & embedded historical extract (as of Feb 10, 2026)**  
   - **What it is:** Primary measurement source and the *resolution source* for the question.  
   - **Quality:** Highest (official CPS unemployment rate).  
   - **What’s factual:** The monthly U-3 history through **Dec 2025** (and the noted recent level in the mid-4s).  
   - **What’s not here:** No March 2026 value yet (future).

2. **FRED (UNRATE), latest obs Dec 2025 = 4.4%**  
   - **What it is:** A republished series (typically sourced from BLS) with convenient summary stats.  
   - **Quality:** Very high for recent values; minor caveat is it’s not the official resolution page (but should match).  
   - **What’s factual:** Recent monthly values and summary statistics (e.g., 1-year range 4.0–4.5).

3. **Agent_report (compiled summary of recent trend + mentions of private forecasts)**  
   - **What it is:** Secondary synthesis; useful for quick triangulation, but depends on cited outlets.  
   - **Quality:** Medium—good as a pointer, but any specific claims should ideally be checked in primary sources.  
   - **What’s factual vs opinion:** The reported Dec 2025=4.4 is factual; statements about “consensus for Jan 2026” and ranges for March are partly factual (if sourced) but not directly verifiable here; interpretation (“most forecasters see flat”) is opinion/synthesis.

4. **JPMorgan outlook (Dec 10, 2025; Michael Feroli)**  
   - **What it is:** Named economist forecast and narrative about 2026 labor conditions.  
   - **Quality:** High (major bank, identifiable forecaster), though still an opinion/forecast.  
   - **Key forecast opinion:** Unemployment **peaks around 4.5% in early 2026**.

5. **Trading Economics (updated Feb 2026)**  
   - **What it is:** Aggregated/model-based projections (“global macro models and analysts expectations”).  
   - **Quality:** Medium—useful as a market-ish reference, but methodology is opaque and can lag.  
   - **Key forecast opinion:** **End of Q1 2026: 4.50%**.

6. **Nomura Connects outlook (Jan 2026)**  
   - **What it is:** Named shop forecast.  
   - **Quality:** High/medium (identifiable institution; still opinion).  
   - **Key forecast opinion:** Unemployment **declines to 4.0% by end-2026** (directionally relevant; less specific for March).

7. **Newsweek article (state-level changes; quotes from various experts)**  
   - **What it is:** Media summary of BLS-related facts plus commentary.  
   - **Quality:** Medium for facts (if accurately reported), lower for inference.  
   - **What’s factual:** December national rate cited around **4.4%**; “weakest year for job growth since 2020” (context).  
   - **What’s opinion:** Zandi/Zaccarelli/Long interpretations about 2026 weakness and “yellow lights.”

8. **FM Magazine (Asia outlook) & CNBC BOJ article**  
   - **What they are:** Mostly irrelevant to the specific U-3 March 2026 point estimate; at best indirect macro background.  
   - **Quality for this question:** Low relevance.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view candidates)

1. **Short-horizon (1–3 month) changes in U-3 conditional on current level (~4–5%)**  
   - **Why suitable:** March 2026 is very near-term; unemployment is typically persistent month-to-month outside recessions.  
   - **Limitation:** Tail risk (rapid deterioration) is not well captured by “normal times” persistence.

2. **“Late-cycle drift up” episodes when U-3 is in the mid-4s and hiring slows (e.g., 2006–07 style plateau)**  
   - **Why suitable:** Current context shows gradual increases and “low-hire, low-fire.”  
   - **Limitation:** Those episodes can transition into recessionary accelerations, but timing is uncertain.

3. **Unconditional historical distribution of U-3 (postwar average 5.7%)**  
   - **Why less suitable:** Too broad; ignores strong persistence and today’s starting point.

**Chosen reference class:** **(1) Short-horizon conditional persistence**, augmented with (2) for asymmetric upside tail risk (a sharper rise can happen, though rarely within 1–2 months unless recession shock).

---

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Target month:** **March 2026** (value to be reported in early April 2026).  
- **From “today” (Feb 10, 2026):** ~7 weeks until March data month ends; ~8 weeks until first publication.  
- **Historical pattern at this horizon:**  
  - In “normal” conditions, monthly U-3 changes are commonly **0.0 to ±0.1 pp**, sometimes ±0.2 pp.  
  - Larger 2–3 month moves (≥ +0.5 pp) tend to cluster around recessions or sudden shocks—*low probability, but not negligible*.

---

### (d) Justification (outside view baseline)

- **Starting point/base rate:** Most recent confirmed level is **4.4% (Dec 2025)**, after a gradual rise through 2025. The 1-year range in FRED is **4.0–4.5**, suggesting we are already near the top of the recent range but not in obviously recessionary territory.
- **Near-term persistence dominates:** With only ~1–2 months from now to the March reference month, the outside view expects **modest movement** rather than a regime change.
- **Central tendency:** Multiple forecasting-oriented sources cluster around **~4.5% for early/Q1 2026** (JPM peak 4.5 early 2026; Trading Economics end-Q1 4.5). That aligns with a midpoint around **4.4–4.6** for March.
- **Tail risks (why the interval should be wide):**
  - **Upside (higher unemployment):** If weak hiring shifts into layoffs, unemployment can jump faster than typical month-to-month persistence would suggest (historically seen near recessions).  
  - **Downside (lower unemployment):** A mild re-tightening is possible if labor force growth slows or hiring stabilizes; however, given we’re not coming from an elevated unemployment level, big declines over 1–2 months are also uncommon.

Overall outside-view stance: **March 2026 is most likely in the mid-4s, centered near 4.5, with modest probability of moving into the low-5s if conditions deteriorate quickly.**

---

Outside view calibration:

- I’m anchoring to a **near-term persistence distribution** (month-to-month changes usually small) but **inflating the upper tail** to reflect the empirical fact that unemployment can move nonlinearly at turning points.  
- Because macro surprises (policy shocks, confidence shifts, rapid layoff cascades, measurement noise) occur often enough, I’m keeping the **10–90 interval wide** for a two-month-ahead macro indicator, rather than overfitting to “it’ll be 4.4 forever.”
