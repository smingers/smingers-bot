Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological & highly-weighted first)
1. BLS series LNS14000000 (last published month Dec-2025 = 4.4%).  Primary, factual, very high quality.  Gives starting point and month-to-month volatility history.  
2. Upcoming January 2026 consensus previews (Dow Jones/WSJ, Goldman, Bloomberg, etc.) all cite 4.4% expected, with a ±0.1 pp band.  These are identifiable expert forecasts; moderate quality because the data are not yet released.  
3. JPMorgan outlook (10 Dec 2025, Michael Feroli) – baseline 4.5 % peak in “early 2026”.  Large bank, clear methodology, moderate-strong evidence.  
4. TradingEconomics model update (Feb 2026).  End-Q1 projection 4.50 %.  Methodology opaque, moderate evidence.  
5. KPMG Economic Compass (Jan 2026) – 4.5 % “stabilisation” in 2026.  Big-Four firm, but mostly opinion; moderate evidence.  
6. RSM US outlook (Jan 2026) – baseline 4.5 %, upside 4.3 %, downside ≥5 %.  Identifiable economists; moderate evidence.  
7. High-frequency indicators: initial claims (≈200 k), JOLTS openings (6.5 m, lowest since 2020) and announced layoffs (worst January since 2009).  Facts from DoL & Challenger; strong evidence that hiring momentum is weak, firing still subdued.  
8. Articles on impending 900 k downward payroll revision.  Factual for payrolls, but revisions do NOT change the household unemployment rate; weak evidence for March UE directly, though it signals softness.

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong:  • Historical month-to-month persistence of U-3 when centred near 4–5 % (usually ±0.1 pp).  
          • Multiple independent institutional forecasts clustering at 4.4–4.6 %.  
Moderate: • Leading indicators (claims ↑ slightly, JOLTS ↓, layoffs ↑) pointing to gradual deterioration → bias to small uptick.  
          • Structural labour-supply squeeze (immigration curbs, retirements) lowering breakeven jobs → caps sharp rise.  
Weak:     • Speculation that large benchmark revision will damage confidence (may influence later months, not March).  
          • Consumer sentiment gyrations.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Target observation is the March-2026 CPS survey week (about seven weeks from today) with first release 3 Apr 2026.  If the horizon were halved (March → mid-Feb rate) I would tighten the distribution by ~20 %.  If doubled (looking to May 2026) I would widen the 80–90th tail by ~0.3 pp because recession odds accumulate.

(d) Justification / adjustments to outside view  
Base-rate (history, persistence) median ≈4.45 %.  
Inside news: leading indicators are softening, and three large forecasters explicitly see 4.5 % in Q1.  Claims are still low, so a spike above 5 % by March would require a very abrupt layoff wave – possible but low-probability.  Therefore:  
• Shift entire distribution up about 0.05–0.10 pp relative to base.  
• Thicken the upper tail (give 10 % chance ≥5.4 %).  
• Leave lower tail almost unchanged; only a 10 % chance of ≤4.1 %, as a quick bounce would need a participation drop or hiring burst that current data do not hint at.

Distribution calibration
Mean ≈4.63 %, median (50th pct ≈ midway of 40th & 60th) ≈4.5–4.6 %.  Matches narrative that March flirts with 4½.  Spread (90–10) = 1.3 pp, wide enough for surprise recession shock.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: seasonally-adjusted U-3 unemployment rate (%) for March 2026 published by BLS.  
2. Outside-view distribution stated and used.  
3. Implied median ≈4.55 %, mean ≈4.63 % – coherent with justification.  
4. Key evidence: a) Dec 2025 level 4.4 %; b) persistence of month-to-month moves; c) consensus institutional forecasts ≈4.5 %; d) soft JOLTS/layoff signals; e) still-low claims.  
5. Blind spot: sudden credit shock triggering mass layoffs in March → outcome >5.5 % (pushes forecast up).  
6. Status-quo pull considered; distribution centred near current level.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, within 0–10 % bounds.
