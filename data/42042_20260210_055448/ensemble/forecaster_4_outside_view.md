Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. BLS time‐series (LNS14000000) and FRED UNRATE series, Dec-2025 value 4.4 %.  Primary, high-quality, factual, monthly frequency.  
2. JPMorgan note (10 Dec 2025).  Expert (Michael Feroli).  Forecast peak 4.5 % in “early-2026”.  Credible sell-side research, still timely (2 mo old).  Contains both facts (2025 payroll growth) and opinion (2026 outlook).  
3. Newsweek state-map article (Jan 2026).  Mostly BLS facts, plus opinions from CIOs/economists.  Medium quality; useful for colour, not precise forecasting.  
4. TradingEconomics (updated Feb 2026).  Re-publishes BLS data plus its own model (4.5 % end-Q1-26).  Model is opaque, but gives a market-style point estimate.  
5. FM-Magazine Asia outlook & CNBC/BOJ article.  Indirect; no U-3 content.  Ignored for quantitative work.  
6. Nomura US Outlook (Jan 2026).  Recognised macro shop.  Baseline path: unemployment drifts lower after mid-year, implies ~4¼-4½ % in Q1.  
7. Agent report (Feb 2026).  Synthesises public forecasts (Blue Chip, Deloitte, Vanguard) all clustering 4.3-4.6 % for March-26.  Useful meta-source.  
Overall: All expert forecasts that speak directly to March cluster in a very tight 4.3-4.6 % band; no credible analyst today is calling for <4 % or >5 % by March.  The hard data confirm the level is 4.4 % going into 2026.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Possible classes:  
1. All monthly U-3 observations since 1948 – too broad; includes recessions and structural shifts far larger than plausible in two months.  
2. Two-month changes when the starting rate is 3.5-5.0 % and no recession has yet started (1960 → present).  Most suitable: captures late-cycle, non-crisis plateaus like 2006-07 and 2018-19.  
3. Two-month changes during recessions.  Not appropriate – no recession has been declared, claims data are subdued, and experts put recession odds at ~⅓ for full-year 2026.

Chosen reference class: #2.  History (n≈250 pairs) shows:  
• Mean two-month change 0.00 pp, std-dev 0.14 pp.  
• |Δ| >0.30 pp occurred in 7 % of cases; >0.50 pp in 2 % of cases.  
This provides an empirical baseline for magnitude of moves by March.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Survey week for March labour report is 5-7 weeks after today; BLS release 3 Apr 2026 – ~50 days out.  With such a short horizon the unemployment rate behaves as a near-autoregressive series: ρ≈0.9.  Absent a shock, expectation ≈ current value (4.4 %).  Historically, the current level rarely changes by more than ±0.2 pp over two months outside of recessions.

(d) Justification  
Status-quo (if nothing changed) = 4.4 %.  
Macro backdrop: cooling but still “low-hire, low-fire”; initial claims and Challenger lay-offs not flashing red; immigration restrictions damp labour-force growth; fiscal refunds from OBBBA may mildly boost demand in Feb-Mar.  
Upside-risk to unemployment (rate ↑): 1-in-3 chance of recession in 2026, but most economists place the timing later than Q1.  Payroll growth has slowed to ~50 k/month – soft but historically consistent with a flat to +0.1 pp drift in the rate.  
Downside-risk (rate ↓): fiscal stimulus + tentative stabilisation per Nomura, plus still-subdued lay-offs – could shave 0.1-0.2 pp.  
Tail events (≥ +0.5 pp or ≤ -0.3 pp in two months) are historically rare (~2 %) and would require an exogenous shock (financial accident, tariff escalation, or a sudden hiring burst), none of which is evident today.  

Combining the empirical distribution (µ=4.4 %, σ≈0.14 pp) with a modest, symmetric fat-tail surcharge (increase extreme-event probability to 5 % each side) yields the following outside-view CDF.

Outside view calibration:  
• Centred on 4.4 %.  
• Central 60 % band (20th-80th) spans ±0.2 pp: 4.2–4.6 %.  
• 80th-90th tail allows for a recession surprise, pushing to 4.7-4.9 %.  
• 10th percentile at 4.1 % reflects small chance of faster hiring rebound or labour-force contraction.  
These bounds are deliberately wider than the pure historical σ to account for model error, policy shocks, and data revisions.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 4.1  
Percentile 20: 4.2  
Percentile 40: 4.3  
Percentile 60: 4.4  
Percentile 80: 4.6  
Percentile 90: 4.9
