Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. BLS historical series (LNS14000000) – primary, high-quality, purely factual. Last published value: 4.4 % for Dec-2025.  
2. JPMorgan (Dec-2025) – reputable sell-side research; provides forecast peak of 4.5 % in “early-2026” (expert opinion).  
3. Newsweek state-level review (Jan-2026) – journalistic, aggregates BLS and Challenger data; factual statistics useful for context, expert quotes of mixed quality.  
4. Trading Economics (Feb-2026) – secondary data aggregator; factual history plus model projection of 4.5 % for 2026 Q1.  
5. Nomura 2026 outlook (Jan-2026) – investment-bank research; baseline path drifts lower to 4.0 % by end-2026, implying roughly mid-4 % in March.  
6. Agent report & FRED extract – machine-generated but draws directly on FRED and mainstream surveys; provides concise history and consensus snapshot (4.3 – 4.6 % cluster for March).  

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes (post-WWII monthly unemployment changes):  
i. All months, all levels (mean Δ = ±0.0 pp, σ ≈0.16 pp).  
ii. Months where unemployment was 4–5 % two months earlier (1985-2025, n≈140). Here the two-month absolute change |Δ|≤0.3 pp in 70 % of cases; tails larger moves (≥0.7 pp) occurred only in recessions (2008, 2020).  
iii. “Late-cycle plateau” episodes (2006-07, 2018-19, 2023-25). Two-month σ ≈0.14 pp, but fatter right tail owing to recession onsets.  
Class (ii) balances sample size with similarity of starting level and seems most suitable.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today → March-2026 release window = 2 reporting months ahead (Jan & Feb data still unknown to us, but only ~55 days until March reference week). Historically, with horizon <3 months, unemployment is highly inertial unless a recession begins; conditional median change over two months is 0.0 pp, IQR ≈ ±0.2 pp.

(d) Justification  
Status quo: 4.4 %. Payroll growth is slow but layoffs remain subdued; leading indicators (initial claims, job openings ratio) imply cooling not collapse. Expert forecasts (JPM, Nomura, Trading Economics, Blue-Chip consensus via Agent report) congregate at 4.4–4.5 % for Mar-2026.  
Upside risks (rate >4.7 %): surprise recession triggered by tariff escalation or financial shock; reference-class frequency ≈5–10 % over two-month horizon.  
Downside risks (rate <4.1 %): sizeable drop needs a hiring surge or participation fall; historically <10 % likelihood in similar contexts.  
Given the very short horizon and inertial nature of the series, an outside-view distribution centred on 4.4 % with moderate (but not tiny) tails is appropriate.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: current 4.4 %.  
Spread: use σ=0.16 pp per month → √2 *0.16 ≈0.23 pp over two months. For Normal(μ=4.4, σ=0.23), the 10th/90th would be 4.0/4.8. To allow for fat tails from rare shocks (observed once every ~15 cases), widen by ≈0.1 pp each side.  
Check against historical extremes: only 2 % of two-month intervals since 1948 moved ≥0.9 pp; keeping 90th at 5.1 % (Δ +0.7) captures that. Likewise 10th at 3.9 % (Δ –0.5) captures rare sharp drops.  
Distribution (strictly increasing):
