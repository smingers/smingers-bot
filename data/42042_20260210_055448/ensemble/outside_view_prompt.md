# Summary of JPMorgan Article: "Will the job market improve in 2026?"

**Date:** December 10, 2025

## Key Facts and Statistics:

### 2025 Labor Market Performance:
- **Monthly payroll growth in 2025:** Average of 50,000 jobs
- **June-August 2025:** Decreased to 29,000 jobs per month
- **Unemployment rate increase:** Rose 30 basis points from January to October 2025
- **Job openings:** Continue to fall

### Trade and Tariff Impact:
- **Static tariff rates:** Increased to 16.5%, up 14 percentage points from previous year
- **Static annual tax equivalent:** Over $500 billion on $3.1 trillion of imported goods
- **Actual tariff collections (as of October):** Annualized pace of $390 billion (reflecting delays and shifting buyer behavior)

### Immigration and Labor Supply:
- **Breakeven employment:** Could decrease from 50,000 to 15,000 per month due to reduced migrant labor supply
- Stricter immigration policies and increased deportations have been more aggressive than anticipated
- Reduced migrant labor supply has not lifted participation in the remainder of the population

### Positive Indicators in 2025:
- **Wage growth:** Remained a full percentage point higher than pre-pandemic rates
- **Labor force participation:** Remained steady for workers aged 16-64 (who comprise 93% of workforce)
- **Average hourly earnings growth:** Accelerated in the second half of 2025, despite rising unemployment

## 2026 Predictions from Named Source:

**Michael Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at J.P. Morgan:**

### Labor Market Forecast:
- **First half of 2026:** "Uncomfortably slow growth" expected
- **Unemployment peak:** 4.5% in early 2026
- **Quits rate:** Lower than pre-COVID levels, indicating decreased worker confidence in finding new roles
- **Job openings to unemployed ratio:** Low, reflecting weak sentiment

### Broader Economic Forecast:
- **GDP for 2026:** Expected to stay steady at 1.8%
- **Inflation for 2026:** Expected at 2.7%
- **Recession risk:** One-in-three chance in 2026
- **Labor market trajectory:** Slowdown expected to "reverse course later in the year"

### Factors Driving Slowdown:
1. **Population changes:** Decreased labor supply from increased deportations, aging population, and significant decrease in visa issuance for workers and students
2. **AI/Technology investment:** Has gone towards equipment, software, and data centers rather than job creation; productivity benefits not yet realized; jobs with more AI exposure have seen slower job growth, especially among younger workers

### Potential Upside:
- Technology adoption may deliver benefits: "Usually, it takes several years for general purpose technologies like AI to boost productivity. A quicker realization of efficiency gains could lead to stronger GDP growth than expected."

## Context on Business Sentiment:
- Business uncertainty driven by quickly changing trade policies and tariffs
- "Businesses are hesitant to make sweeping changes to either grow or shrink their payrolls when they're unsure what the next six months might hold"
- Layoff and hiring rates have been low

Query: Provide latest US U-3 unemployment rates through Jan 2026, discuss recent trend and summarize any professional forecasts for March 2026 unemployment; include historical comparisons with late-cycle periods such as 2006-08 and 2018-20.
Latest available U-3 readings (seasonally adjusted)
• Dec-2025 (most recent official release): 4.4 % (FRED series UNRATE).  
• The January-2026 Employment Situation report has been delayed to 11 Feb 2026; the FactSet/Dow Jones consensus is that the rate will remain at 4.4 % (Morningstar, 5 Feb 2026; Investopedia, 10 Feb 2026).  
• Monthly path in 2025: 4.0 % (Jan), 4.2 % (Feb–Apr), 4.3 % (May), 4.1 % (Jun), 4.3 % (Jul–Aug), 4.4 % (Sep), 4.5 % (Nov), 4.4 % (Dec) (FRED).

Recent trend
1. Plateau at a mid-4 % level:   The jobless rate drifted up 0.3 pp over the last twelve months (Dec-24 4.1 % → Dec-25 4.4 %). The rise was gradual, reflecting a “low-hire, low-fire” environment in which employers slowed recruiting but have not resorted to large layoffs (Indeed Hiring Lab, Nov-2025).
2. Broad deceleration in labor demand: job openings are at their lowest since 2020, and payroll growth averaged only ~60 k/month in Q4-2025 (Investopedia, 10 Feb 2026).  
3. Nonetheless, unemployment remains low by historical standards (post-war average 5.7 %).

Professional forecasts for March-2026 (to be reported 3 Apr 2026)
Explicit March-2026 point forecasts are scarce, but several institutions provide quarterly or 2026-average projections that bracket where the rate is likely to stand in March:

• Blue Chip/Indeed Hiring Lab “consensus scenario” for end-2026: 4.4 % (range 4.1–4.8 %) (Indeed Hiring Lab, Nov-2025). With no recession assumed, their path implies the rate hugging the mid-4 % area through mid-year, including March.

• Deloitte Economics baseline: 4.5 % for CY-2026 (Deloitte Q4-2025 forecast). Their quarterly path shows the rate moving only a tenth above current levels early in the year and stabilising—again consistent with ~4.5 % in March.

• Vanguard (via Investopedia interview, 10 Feb 2026): projects a 2026 decline to 4.2 % as AI-related investment revives hiring. Translating that to a time-profile, Vanguard expects slippage below today’s 4.4 % as early as Q2; March would therefore straddle 4.3-4.4 %.

• FactSet consensus for Jan-2026 (4.4 %) plus commentary from PNC and Nationwide that “little change” is expected in coming months (Morningstar, 5 Feb 2026) suggests that most private forecasters see the unemployment rate remaining flat into the spring.

Synthesising the above, the professional range for March-2026 is 4.3 %–4.6 %, with the weight of opinion clustered around 4.4-4.5 %.

Historical late-cycle comparisons

1. 2006-08 (pre-Great Recession):
   • Unemployment averaged 4.6 % in 2006, edged up to 5.0 % by April-2008 and then climbed rapidly to 7.3 % by December-2008.  
   • Current conditions resemble the early stage of that episode—rate hovering in the mid-4 % zone for a year—before the spike. So far, however, today’s rise is much tamer (only +0.3 pp y/y) and is not accompanied by surging initial claims or mass layoffs.

2. 2018-20 (pre-pandemic):
   • Unemployment stood at 3.8 % in 2018 and reached a 50-year low of 3.5 % in late-2019/Feb-2020.  
   • Compared with that period, today’s 4.4 % signifies a labour market that has already loosened by roughly 0.9 pp, reflecting slower hiring, tighter immigration policy and higher tariffs (Morningstar; Deloitte).

3. Other labour-slack indicators:
   • Underemployment (people working part-time for economic reasons) spiked after 2008 but, unlike then, has fallen back in line with unemployment post-COVID, suggesting less hidden slack today (Cleveland Fed Commentary, 2022).  
   • The diffusion index of payroll growth (50.8 in Dec-2025; Morningstar) is barely above the 50 cutoff, versus the broad-based strength seen in 2019.

Key drivers shaping the 2026 outlook
• Immigration policy: restrictions are holding down labour-force growth and keeping the unemployment rate from rising faster (Morningstar; Deloitte).  
• Tariffs: higher input costs and uncertainty have curbed hiring plans, but they also tamp labour supply, creating offsetting effects (Investopedia, 10 Feb 2026; Deloitte).  
• AI investment cycle: forecasters diverge on whether AI will spur a hiring rebound (Vanguard) or, in a downside scenario, trigger a capex pull-back and higher unemployment later in 2027 (Deloitte).  
• Fiscal policy: 2026 tax cuts (“One Big, Beautiful Bill”) could boost demand and payrolls (Investopedia/Vanguard).

Take-aways
• Latest confirmed U-3 = 4.4 % (Dec-25). January-26 is expected to match that figure; forecasts for March-26 cluster around 4.4-4.5 %.  
• The labour market has cooled from the exceptionally tight 2018-19 conditions but is far from recessionary levels.  
• Compared with the 2006-07 late-cycle plateau, the current drift appears milder and less synchronized with rapid job-loss indicators, yet vigilance is warranted as policy shocks (tariffs, AI investment swings, immigration) create two-sided risks.

Remaining information gaps
1. The actual January-2026 unemployment rate will only be known on 11 Feb 2026; without it we cannot confirm whether the consensus was accurate.  
2. There are no publicly available, high-frequency forecasts specifically for March-2026 from the Fed or CBO; only annual/quarterly averages are published.  
3. A precise historical data table for 2006-08 and 2018-20 monthly unemployment would sharpen the quantitative comparison.

If deeper precision is required, new queries aimed at “Blue Chip March 2026 unemployment survey”, “CBO January 2026 economic projection unemployment path”, or pulling full historical monthly UNRATE data for 2006-08 and 2018-20 from FRED would close those gaps.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
