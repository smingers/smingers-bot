Analysis:
The value we need will be published by the BLS in early April 2026, but the best way to form an outside view today (10 Feb 2026) is to look at:  
• The trajectory of the monthly U-3 rate over the past two years, especially the most recent data (Dec-23 → Jan-26).  
• Macro expectations and leading indicators (payroll growth, JOLTS, ISM employment indexes, initial claims, recession probability estimates).  
• Consensus forecasts in the financial press and research notes released after the January 2026 Employment Situation report.  
Historical context—particularly how the unemployment rate behaved during prior late-cycle slowdowns—will help in anchoring prediction distributions (e.g., 2006-08, 2019-20 pre-COVID).  
Therefore, I want:  
1) A broad Google search to pull BLS tables, FRED charts and analyst blogs summarizing the recent trend.  
2) A Google News search to surface fresh commentary and forecasts published since the latest jobs report.  
3) An Agent search that explicitly asks for the latest monthly figures, the 3-, 6- and 12-month changes, and any reputable forecasts for March 2026, plus historical analogues.  
4) A FRED query for the UNRATE series to quickly download the full historical time series and compute average moves in the two months following January over past decades.
