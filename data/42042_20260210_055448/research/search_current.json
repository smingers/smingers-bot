Forecasts for End of 2026:\nIndeed Hiring Lab constructed three scenarios for the unemployment rate at the end of 2026, based on Wolters Kluwer's Blue Chip GDP growth forecasts (November 2025):\n\n1. **Consensus Scenario:** \n   - Based on Blue Chip consensus forecast of 1.8% real GDP growth (average of 45 economist forecasts)\n   - Estimated unemployment rate: **Not explicitly stated in extracted text, but implied to be mid-range**\n\n2. **Upside Scenario:**\n   - Based on average of top 10 GDP forecasts: 2.5% growth\n   - Estimated unemployment rate: **4.1%**\n\n3. **Downside Scenario:**\n

Context:\n- The report notes that \"both the current unemployment rate and level of job postings are within this range and close to the consensus scenario\"\n- This indicates that as of November 2025, the unemployment rate was already near the consensus forecast level\n\n### Labor Market Characterization:\n- The consensus scenario suggests continuation of the current \"low-hire, low-fire\" labor market\n- The upside scenario would indicate \"a labor market taking a turn for the better\"\n- The downside scenario assumes \"uncertainty persists and consumer sentiment remains weak\"\n\n### Supporting Economic Context:\n- Job openings estimated to range from 6.8 million to 7.4 million at end of 2026\n- The report states unemployment is \"likely to rise, but not alarmingly so\"\n- Labor demand cooled throughout 2025, leading to \"slower wage growth, declining labor force participation, and longer job searches for unemployed workers\"\n\n**Note:** The article appears to be truncated

Interest Rate Cut Probability Could Shift Dramatically**\nThe U.S. January nonfarm employment report, scheduled for release on Wednesday, February 11, 2026, at 21:30 Beijing time, is drawing significant market attention. While the expected net addition of 70,000 jobs is a key focus, the primary concern lies in a potential major downward revision of past employment data\u2014estimated at approximately 900,000 jobs\u2014covering the 12 months ending March 2025. This revision, based on more complete data, could indicate that the U.S. labor market was weaker than previously reported. Key leading indicators point to weakening labor conditions: JOLTS job openings fell to 6.54 million, the lowest since the pandemic, and initial jobless claims rose to a near-five-month high, signaling a possible shift from low layoffs to moderate layoffs without corresponding hiring increases. Despite expectations of a 'smooth' report\u2014modest job growth, stable unemployment (U3 rate expected at 4.4%), and gradual wage growth\u2014market participants are assessing the risk of a negative reaction if the revision exceeds 100,000 jobs. This could trigger a reassessment of Federal Reserve rate-cut timing, with current market pricing suggesting a 16.7% probability of a rate cut in March. If the data is weak or the revision is large, and if the upcoming CPI report shows cooling inflation, the probability could rise above 33%. Technical analysis of the USD/JPY pair suggests that a strong report could push the pair toward resistance at 157.50, while a weak report or significant downward revision could cause a drop to support levels around 154.00, including the 100-day EMA (154.36) and the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement zone.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 03:56 AM\nSource:[\u548c\u8baf\u5916\u6c47](http://forex.hexun.com/2026-02-10/223442410.html)\n\n**U.S. Consumer Expected Inflation Rate Drops to 3.1% in January 2026 \u2013 Lowest in Six Months**\nThe U.S. consumer expected inflation rate for January 2026 dropped to 3.1%, a 0.3 percentage point decrease from the previous month's 3.4%, marking the lowest level in six months since July 2025, according to the New York Federal Reserve's monthly consumer expectations survey. While short-term inflation expectations eased, medium- and long-term expectations remained stable at 3.0% for both 3-year and 5-year horizons\u2014still above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2.0% target. Employment outlook showed slight improvement, with the average probability of finding a new job within three months rising to 45.6% from 43.1% the prior month. However, the share of respondents expecting higher unemployment in one year increased, indicating lingering medium-term uncertainty. On financial conditions, expectations for future income rose, but expectations for actual income levels dipped slightly, and more consumers anticipate greater difficulty accessing credit. Overall, consumers expressed more pessimistic views on current and future financial health. Housing market expectations also declined slightly, with the projected home price increase over the next year falling to 2.9% from 3.0%. The New York Fed noted that while concerns about inflation and employment have eased, financial well-being remains a source of anxiety. This mixed sentiment presents a complex environment for monetary policy, with Fed Chair Jerome Powell highlighting a persistent gap between consumer survey data and strong consumer spending trends. The decline in short-term inflation expectations is seen as a potentially positive signal for the Federal Reserve, which maintained interest rates at 3.5\u20133.75% in January after lowering them by 75 basis points in 2025 to counter economic slowdown while controlling inflation. At the January FOMC meeting, rates were held steady, though some committee members favored further cuts. Fed officials continue to assess the labor market as a 'low hiring, low firing' environment, with some policymakers arguing that short-term credit costs should be eased to prevent deeper labor market strain.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 03:51 AM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20260210_0003509716)\n\n**How Much Has the U.S. Labor Market Slowed? Watch the Wednesday Nonfarm Report, It\u2019s Crucial**\nThe upcoming U.S. January nonfarm employment report, scheduled for release on Wednesday, is of critical importance in assessing the extent to which the American labor market has slowed. Originally set for February 6, 2026, the report was delayed due to a partial government shutdown. According to the Bloomberg median forecast, January nonfarm employment is expected to rise by 69,000 jobs, with the unemployment rate held steady at 4.4%, slightly below the 4.5% four-year high reached in November 2025. Analysts anticipate the report will reinforce the prevailing picture of a weak labor market. In addition to standard monthly employment and unemployment figures, the report will include significant revisions to prior data: the initial estimate had shown a downward revision of 911,000 jobs over the year ending March 2025, marking a record adjustment. This revision reflects a more severe slowdown in hiring than previously thought. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) conducts annual benchmark revisions using the Quarterly Census of Employment and Wages (QCEW), which is based on state unemployment insurance records and covers most U.S. jobs. The revisions will adjust the 2025 March employment level and re-evaluate job changes throughout 2025, incorporating updated models for business openings and closures and new seasonal adjustments. Economists previously described the labor market as operating in a 'low hiring, low layoffs' environment in 2025, but the revised data may indicate hiring has slowed even further. This could shift the Federal Reserve\u2019s perspective: Chair Jerome Powell has noted signs of stabilization, suggesting job growth may have been overstated, but the economy remains robust enough to justify maintaining current interest rates. In contrast, Fed Governor Christopher Waller argued that the revisions likely indicate nearly zero job growth in 2025, stating, 'Zero. Nothing. Not at all. This is not a healthy labor market.' Recent data supports this view: U.S. companies announced the highest January layoffs since the Great Recession, and JOLTS job openings fell to their lowest level since 2020. Importantly, the revisions do not affect the unemployment rate, which is based on household surveys, while nonfarm employment data comes from business surveys. Due to the prolonged government shutdown in 2025, the usual update to population estimates in the household survey was delayed by one month. The trend of large revisions in employment data has been growing in recent years, attributed by some economists to post-pandemic economic dynamics. The issue has become highly politicized, contributing to former President Trump\u2019s dismissal of the previous BLS director, whom he accused of politically manipulating data. Trump again criticized BLS for issuing 'extremely inaccurate data' when appointing a new director. Economists widely reject this claim, emphasizing that revisions are inevitable as more data becomes available and are essential for balancing speed and accuracy, ensuring data comparability over time. 'Revisions can cause confusion, fuel conspiracy theories, and even lead to dismissals. But if they are transparent, predictable, and well-documented, they should actually increase trust in official statistics.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 11:20 PM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8qcaMlsaCU5)\n\n**What To Expect From Wednesday's Report On The Job Market**\nThe U.S. job market is expected to show modest growth in January, with employers likely adding 55,000 jobs\u2014up from 50,000 in December\u2014according to a survey of economists by Dow Jones Newswires and The Wall Street Journal. Job gains are forecast to be concentrated in healthcare, while hiring remains constrained in other sectors. The unemployment rate is expected to remain steady at 4.4%, a historically low level. However, the report may reveal a grim revision: the final revision of the January data, incorporating a quarterly survey delayed by a government shutdown, is likely to show significantly fewer jobs added between March 2024 and March 2025 than initially reported\u2014potentially erasing most of the job growth previously recorded. This downward revision follows a preliminary report in September that found nearly a million fewer jobs created than originally estimated. Contributing factors include Trump\u2019s fluctuating tariffs, which have created business uncertainty; an immigration crackdown that has reduced the labor supply; and the increasing adoption of AI, which some companies are using to shrink workforces. Federal Reserve officials are growing concerned about a potential rise in unemployment as job openings in December fell to their lowest level since 2020, a key leading indicator of future hiring trends.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 09:14 PM\nSource:[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/what-to-expect-from-wednesday-s-report-on-the-job-market-11902860)\n\n**Goldman Sachs unveils jobs forecast ahead of unemployment report this week**\nGoldman Sachs has released a jobs forecast ahead of the February 11, 2026, Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) unemployment report, warning of persistent weakness in the U.S. labor market. The bank forecasts that the January unemployment rate will remain unchanged at 4.4%, with a slim possibility of rounding down to 4.3% from December\u2019s unrounded 4.38%. Despite three Federal Reserve rate cuts in September, October, and December 2025 aimed at stimulating hiring, job growth has slowed, with Goldman Sachs projecting only 44,000 jobs created\u2014well below the consensus forecast of 70,000. Key indicators include a rise in layoffs, with 1.2 million reported in 2025 (the 7th worst year since 1989), January layoffs being the worst since 2009, and a year-over-year decline of 966,000 job openings to 6.5 million in December. Wage growth has also slowed, with median wage growth falling to 3.7% in December from 4.2% in 2024, and real average weekly earnings growth dropping to 1.07% from 1.75%. Goldman Sachs also warns of a negative annual benchmark revision of 750,000 to 900,000 jobs between April 2024 and March 2025, and a methodological update to the birth-death model that may increase month-to-month volatility in payroll data. The Fed\u2019s dual mandate\u2014low unemployment and low inflation\u2014remains in tension, as the 5.75% rate hike from 2022 to 2024 successfully reduced inflation but raised unemployment from 3.4% to 4.4%. With unemployment near 12-month highs and the Fed holding rates steady in January, a continued 4.4% unemployment rate would pressure the Fed to cut rates at the March meeting, while a drop to 4.3% or lower would signal improvement for workers but reduce the likelihood of further cuts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 05:07 PM\nSource:[TheStreet](https://www.thestreet.com/employment/goldman-sachs-unveils-jobs-forecast-ahead-of-unemployment-report-this-week)\n\n**Unemployment Slightly Rises: 'Typical Phenomenon for This Period'**\nAccording to estimates from the Ministry of Labour and Social Policy (MRPiPS), the registered unemployment rate in Poland at the end of January 2026 ranged from 3.8% in the Greater Poland Voivodeship to 9.9% in the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship. This represents a 0.6 percentage point increase in Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, a 0.4 percentage point rise in six voivodeships, a 0.3 percentage point rise in seven voivodeships, and a 0.2 percentage point rise in two voivodeships. The estimated national registered unemployment rate was 6.0% in January 2026, an increase of 0.3 percentage points from December 2025. The Ministry noted that a similar rise in January had occurred in 2023, 2024, and 2025. MRPiPS estimated that 934,800 people were registered as unemployed at employment offices at the end of January 2026, which is 47,000 more than in December 2025. The Ministry emphasized that the increase in unemployment during January is a typical seasonal phenomenon, driven by seasonal employment patterns and the expiration of year-end contracts. It also highlighted that the growth rate of unemployment in January 2026 was lower than in the same month in 2023, 2024, and 2025.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 05:02 PM\nSource:[TVP Info](https://www.tvp.info/91497666/bezrobocie-w-polsce-raport-mrips-ile-osob-bez-pracy-zmiany-na-rynku-pracy)\n\n**Hassett: Expect Lower Job Growth, But It\u2019s Not Economic Weakness**\nKevin Hassett, Director of the National Economic Council (NEC), urged Americans to expect lower monthly job growth in the coming months, emphasizing that this trend is not a sign of economic weakness.

He stated, 'Do not panic if you see a sequence of lower numbers than you are used to,' noting that these figures are consistent with the current high GDP growth. According to Hassett, the labor force participation threshold\u2014jobs needed to keep unemployment stable\u2014is now 'significantly lower' than under the Biden administration, due to productivity 'soaring.'

A total of 934,800 people were registered as unemployed in January, 47,000 more than in December. The rise is attributed to seasonal factors, including the expiration of year-end employment contracts. Regional disparities were noted, with the lowest unemployment rate at 3.8% in Greater Poland Voivodeship and the highest at 9.9% in Warmia-Masuria Voivodeship. The increase in unemployment was less pronounced than in the same month during 2023\u20132025. Meanwhile, job offers submitted to employment offices rose by 22.4% to 25,400 in January. According to Eurostat methodology, the unemployment rate in Poland stood at 3.2% in December 2025, matching Malta and ranking second lowest in the EU, behind the Czech Republic (3.1%).

The unemployment rate varied regionally, ranging from 3.8% in Greater Poland Voivodeship to 9.9% in Warmia-Masuria Voivodeship, with increases of 0.6 percentage points in Warmia-Masuria, 0.4 points in six voivodeships, 0.3 points in seven, and 0.2 points in two. The ministry noted that the January increase is a typical seasonal trend, driven by the expiration of year-end contracts and seasonal employment patterns. However, the growth rate in January 2026 was lower than in the same month during 2023\u20132025. Meanwhile, job offers submitted to employment offices rose by 22.4% to 25,400 in January 2026 compared to December 2025. According to Eurostat methodology, the unemployment rate in Poland was 3.2% in December 2025, stable and among the lowest in the EU\u2014tied with Malta and behind only the Czech Republic (3.1%). The EU average was 5.9%. The ministry projected continued economic growth in 2026, expecting a gradual reversal of the seasonal unemployment rise due to increased activity in construction, services, and recruitment by firms.

Inflation pressures in January are expected to have slightly eased, with consumer prices projected to rise 0.3% month-on-month and 2.5% year-on-year (down from 2.7% in December), while core inflation is forecast to rise 0.4% monthly and remain unchanged at 2.6% annually. These figures, along with producer price data, will be released on Friday at 14:30. The delayed January jobs report is expected on Wednesday at 14:30, with economists forecasting a 60,000 increase in non-farm payrolls (up from 50,000 in December), a stable unemployment rate at 4.4%, and a 0.3% monthly rise in hourly wages. Additional U.S. data includes retail sales (up 0.3% month-on-month, excluding autos: +0.4%) and import prices, all due Tuesday at 14:30. In the Eurozone, preliminary data shows GDP grew by 0.3% in the fourth quarter of 2025, slightly above the expected 0.2%, with Eurostat set to confirm the figure on Friday at 11:00. Markets are assessing whether the labor market is cooling and inflation is moderating, key factors influencing the Federal Reserve's future rate decisions.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 06:03 AM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/konjunktur-im-blick-us-arbeitsmarkt-und-verbraucherpreise-im-fokus-ce7e5adeda80ff23)\n\n**U.S. Weekly Unemployment Claims Rise Slightly to 200,000, Below Forecasts Amid Labor Market Stability**\nThe number of new weekly unemployment claims in the United States increased by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 200,000 for the week ending January 17, 2026, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. This figure was below the expected 210,000 forecast by Reuters economists. The modest rise occurred amid persistent data volatility due to seasonal adjustments around year-end and early-year holidays. Despite this noise, the broader labor market picture remains stable. The labor market continues to reflect a 'low hiring, low firing' environment, with employers hesitant to expand staff or lay off workers. Economists attribute this dynamic to uncertainty surrounding Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive trade and immigration policies, which have dampened both labor demand and supply. Additionally, strong investment in artificial intelligence is prompting companies to reassess staffing needs, further limiting hiring plans. Firms are prioritizing productivity gains over workforce expansion, contributing to slower employment growth. The data covers the period during which the government surveyed employers for non-agricultural payroll data in the January employment report. Payrolls increased by 50,000 jobs in December, in line with the average monthly gain projected through 2025. Upcoming revisions to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) benchmark may reveal a softer trend, with preliminary estimates suggesting approximately 911,000 fewer jobs created over the 12 months ending March 2025 than previously reported. This discrepancy is linked to the BLS birth-death model, which estimates job gains and losses from business openings and closures. Starting in January 2026, the BLS will update the model monthly with more current sample data, potentially leading to downward revisions in reported employment levels. Continuing claims, which track individuals receiving unemployment benefits beyond the initial week, fell by 26,000 to 1.849 million for the week ending January 10. Part of this decline likely reflects claimants exhausting benefits, typically capped at 26 weeks in most states. Surveys suggest many laid-off workers are struggling to find new employment, indicating weaker underlying labor demand. The four-week moving average of initial claims decreased by 3,750 to 201,500, underscoring relative labor market stability. Federal policy outlook remains cautious, with expectations that the Federal Reserve will hold interest rates steady in its upcoming meeting, balancing persistent inflation against signs of softening job growth. Uncertainty over who Trump will nominate as the next Fed chair is affecting markets, following renewed criticism of Jerome Powell for not cutting rates more aggressively. Powell has warned that the labor market may be weaker than it appears, suggesting recent job gains could be revised downward. Major companies including UPS, General Motors, Amazon, and Verizon have recently announced job cuts, highlighting ongoing challenges for workers despite low initial claims.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 02:51 PM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/it/notizie/2026/01/22/le-sussidi-di-disoccupazione-settimanali-negli-stati-uniti-aumentano-di-1-000-fino-a-200-000-sotto-le-previsioni/)\n\n**U.S. Initial Unemployment Claims Rise Slightly to 200,000, Below Projections Amid Signs of Labor Market Stability**\nThe number of new initial claims for U.S. unemployment benefits rose slightly by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 200,000 in the week ending January 17, 2026, according to the U.S. Department of Labor. This figure remained below the Reuters-predicted 210,000, indicating continued labor market stability despite ongoing volatility due to seasonal adjustments around the year-end and new year. Economists describe the labor market as characterized by 'low hiring, low firing,' with employers cautious about both hiring and layoffs. This trend is attributed partly to uncertainty over former President Donald Trump\u2019s aggressive trade and immigration policies, which have dampened both labor supply and demand. Additionally, major investments in artificial intelligence are prompting companies to reassess staffing needs, favoring productivity gains over workforce expansion. Job growth remains slow. The December payroll report showed a gain of 50,000 jobs, consistent with average monthly increases up to 2025. Upcoming benchmark revisions from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) may reveal weaker job growth, with preliminary estimates suggesting around 911,000 fewer jobs created over the 12 months ending March 2025 than previously reported, due to flaws in the BLS's birth-death model. Starting in January, the BLS will update its model with more frequent monthly data, potentially leading to lower reported employment levels. Continuing claims, which reflect the number of individuals receiving benefits beyond the initial week, fell by 26,000 to 1.849 million in the week ending January 10, 2026\u2014partly due to benefit exhaustion in most states, which limits benefits to 26 weeks. A four-week moving average of initial claims fell by 3,750 to 201,500, reinforcing the overall stability of the labor market. The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady at its upcoming meeting, balancing persistent inflation against signs of slowing job growth. Uncertainty over Trump\u2019s potential appointment of a new Fed chair has added market pressure, especially after renewed criticism of Jerome Powell for not cutting rates more aggressively. Powell has warned that the labor market may be weaker than it appears and that recent job gains could be revised downward. Recent job cuts by major companies including UPS, General Motors, Amazon, and Verizon underscore ongoing challenges for workers despite low headline unemployment figures.\nOriginal language: da\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 02:51 PM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/da/nyheder/2026/01/22/usas-ugentlige-arbejdsloshedsunderstottelse-stiger-med-1-000-til-200-000-hvilket-er-under-prognoserne/)\n\n**U.S. Unemployment Claims Rise Modestly, GDP Growth for Third Quarter Upwardly Revised**\nThe U.S. labor market remains in a 'few hires, few layoffs' state despite volatility in weekly unemployment claims due to seasonal adjustments around the year-end and New Year. Weekly initial unemployment claims rose by 1,000 to a seasonally adjusted 200,000 for the week ending January 17, 2026, below the Reuters-predicted 210,000. The U.S. economy is experiencing jobless growth, with strong GDP growth in the third quarter revised upward to an annualized 4.4%, up from the initial estimate of 4.3%. This growth was driven by increased consumer and corporate investments in artificial intelligence, higher exports, and a reduced trade deficit. Consumer spending, which accounts for over two-thirds of U.S. economic activity, rose 3.5% in the third quarter. However, job creation remains weak, with non-farm payroll jobs increasing by 50,000 in December, aligning with the 2025 monthly average. The Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) will revise its employment data in the next month, revealing that approximately 911,000 fewer jobs were created between March 2024 and March 2025 than previously reported, attributed to the 'birth-death' model. The BLS will update this model starting with the January report to include monthly real-time survey data. Continuing claims, a measure of joblessness persistence, fell by 26,000 to 1.849 million for the week ending January 10, though this decline may reflect seasonal adjustment issues and exhaustion of benefit eligibility (typically 26 weeks in most states). The Federal Reserve is expected to hold interest rates steady next week. Inflation rose in the third quarter, with the domestic gross purchases price index increasing at a 3.4% annual rate\u2014the fastest since Q1 2023\u2014while the core personal consumption expenditures index (excluding food and energy) rose 2.9%, a key Fed target. Economists note a K-shaped recovery, with higher-income households and large firms benefiting from stock market gains and high real estate prices, while low- and middle-income households and small businesses struggle due to inflation and tighter immigration policies. Stock markets opened higher, the dollar declined against a basket of currencies, and U.S. Treasury yields were mostly lower.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 01:36 PM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/us-arbeitslosenantraege-steigen-moderat-bip-wachstum-fuer-das-dritte-quartal-nach-oben-revidiert-ce7e58d3d98cf22d)\n\n**US job growth slows, unemployment rate eases**\nUS job growth slowed more than expected in December 2025, with non-farm payrolls increasing by 50,000 jobs\u2014down from a revised 56,000 in November\u2014according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). This fell short of the Reuters-poll forecast of 60,000 jobs. The unemployment rate dipped to 4.4%, down from 4.5% in November (revised from 4.6%), supporting expectations that the Federal Reserve would hold interest rates steady in January 2026. The labour market remains in a 'no hire, no fire' mode, indicating a jobless expansion. Economic growth and productivity surged in Q3 2025, partly due to rising AI investment. However, job growth momentum weakened starting in 2024, with the BLS revising down total job creation for the 12 months through March 2025 by about 911,000 due to overcounting in the birth-death model. The BLS will release a full benchmark revision in February 2026 and plans to update the model by incorporating current monthly data starting January 2026. The unemployment rate is derived from the household survey, and annual population control adjustments\u2014normally released with the January report\u2014will be delayed. Economists note that low labour supply has constrained the unemployment rate, estimating that 50,000 to 120,000 jobs per month are needed to match working-age population growth. The Federal Reserve cut its benchmark rate by 0.25 percentage points to 3.50%-3.75% in December 2025 but signaled a pause on further cuts, citing structural challenges in the labour market driven by tariffs and AI investment. These factors suggest the current job market issues are more structural than cyclical, reducing the effectiveness of interest rate cuts to stimulate hiring.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 09, 2026 02:37 PM\nSource:[The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/business/economy/us-job-growth-slows-in-december-unemployment-rate-eases-to-4-4)\n\n**U.S. Productivity Surge in Q3 Signals Jobless Growth; Unemployment Claims Rise Slightly**\nU.S. labor market data released on Thursday showed a significant productivity surge in the third quarter, the strongest since 2023, with non-agricultural productivity growing at an annualized rate of 4.9%, up from 4.1% in the second quarter. This increase, driven in part by advancements in artificial intelligence, contributed to a decline in unit labor costs by 1.9% and supports the concept of 'jobless growth,' where economic output rises without proportional job creation. Despite robust GDP growth of 4.3% in Q3, initial jobless claims rose by 8,000 to 208,000 (seasonally adjusted), slightly below the Reuters forecast of 210,000. The labor market remains tight, with the job-to-unemployed ratio falling to 0.91 in November\u2014the lowest since March 2021. Meanwhile, announced layoffs by U.S. companies in 2025 rose 58% to a five-year high of 1.206 million, primarily due to cost-cutting and technology-driven restructuring, especially in the tech sector. New job openings dropped 34% to 507,647\u2014the lowest since 2010\u2014indicating prolonged unemployment for many. The number of people continuing to receive unemployment benefits rose by 56,000 to 1.914 million in the week ending December 27. The Federal Reserve has room for potential rate cuts due to strong productivity, which has helped moderate inflationary pressures. Additionally, the trade deficit shrank 39% to $29.4 billion in October\u2014the lowest since June 2009\u2014due to reduced imports, largely driven by tariffs under former President Donald Trump. The goods trade deficit fell 24.5% to $59.1 billion, the lowest since March 2016. The Atlanta Fed raised its Q4 GDP forecast from 2.7% to 5.4%. Economists, including Christopher Rupkey of FWDBONDS, noted that while economic prospects for 2026 are the strongest in history, American workers are being left behind as firms maintain low labor costs by avoiding hiring.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 08, 2026 07:19 PM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/us-arbeitslosenmeldungen-steigen-leicht-an-produktivitaetsschub-im-dritten-quartal-ce7e59ddde8bf324)\n\n**U.S. Initial Unemployment Claims Drop 13,000 to 224,000, Signaling Low Layoffs Amid Economic Slowdown Concerns**\nInitial unemployment claims in the United States fell by 13,000 to 224,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis for the week ending December 13, 2025, reversing a sharp increase from the prior week and signaling sustained low layoffs. The figure slightly exceeded consensus expectations of 225,000, reinforcing the resilience of the labor market despite broader economic slowdown concerns heading into 2026. The decline follows a spike to 236,000 the previous week\u2014the largest weekly increase since March 2020\u2014though the drop is largely attributed to seasonal distortions during the December holiday period rather than a genuine weakening in hiring behavior. The four-week moving average rose slightly to 217,500 but remains historically low and well below the 300,000 threshold typically associated with significant labor market stress. Continued claims, which measure workers already receiving benefits, increased by 67,000 to 1.897 million for the week ending December 6, suggesting some job seekers are taking longer to find new employment\u2014likely reflecting softer hiring conditions rather than widespread layoffs. The U.S. Department of Labor also reported that non-farm payrolls grew by only 64,000 in November, underscoring that while layoffs remain contained, job creation has sharply decelerated. The data has immediate implications for Federal Reserve policy expectations: weaker labor market indicators support continued rate cuts in 2026, as persistent low layoffs and slowing hiring may justify an accommodative stance without reigniting inflation. Markets reacted subtly, with the U.S. dollar index dipping slightly to 98.30, signaling traders view the data as favorable for a dovish Fed path through early 2026. Additionally, November\u2019s Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 2.7% year-on-year\u2014below the 3.1% forecast\u2014with core inflation falling to 2.6%, further boosting investor optimism about accelerated rate cuts. The upcoming December employment report, expected in early January, will determine whether the apparent slowdown in November was temporary or indicative of a deeper trend.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: December 18, 2025 02:26 PM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/pt/noticias/2025/12/18/os-beneficios-iniciais-de-desemprego-nos-eua-caem-13-000-chegando-a-224-000-sinalizando-baixas-demissoes/)\n\n**U.S. Initial Jobless Claims Surge by 44,000, Marking Largest Increase in 4.5 Years**\nThe number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits surged by 44,000 in the week ending December 6, 2025, marking the largest increase in 4.5 years, according to data released by the U.S. Department of Labor on Thursday, December 11. The figure rose to 236,000, compared to 192,000 in the prior week\u2014previously the lowest in three years. Economists caution that seasonal fluctuations during the winter holiday period can distort weekly data. The four-week moving average, however, remained stable at 217,000, indicating continued overall labor market resilience. The spike followed a sharp decline in the previous week, highlighting volatility. Major companies including Amazon and Pepsi have announced layoffs, with October seeing the highest job cuts since early 2023. Analysts suggest the labor market is in a 'no-hire, no-fire' state after adjusting for seasonality. Unadjusted data showed a nearly 115,000 increase\u2014the largest since March 2020. California, Illinois, New York, and Texas were the primary contributors to the rise. The November employment report, delayed by a 43-day government shutdown, will be released the following Tuesday and will include October\u2019s nonfarm payroll data. However, due to the shutdown, household survey data\u2014used to calculate the unemployment rate\u2014could not be collected, so the October unemployment rate will not be available. Economists attribute the labor market stagnation to weak labor supply, reduced immigration, lower import tariffs, and AI-driven job displacement. \nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 11, 2025 09:37 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/12/11/n14653724.htm)\n\n**U.S. Weekly Unemployment Claims Rise Amid Seasonal Adjustments**\nThe number of new weekly unemployment claims in the United States rose to 236,000 for the week ending December 6, 2025, according to the U.S. Department of Labor, a 44,000 increase from the previous week. Economists surveyed by Reuters had expected 220,000 claims. The rise is likely due to seasonal adjustments rather than a true deterioration in labor market conditions. The prior week's figure had dropped to its lowest level in three years, partly due to data adjustment challenges during the Thanksgiving holiday. Despite this, economists continue to describe the labor market as being in a 'no-hiring, no-layoff' state, even as major companies like Amazon announce job cuts. The Federal Reserve lowered its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points on Wednesday, bringing it to a range of 3.50% to 3.75%, but signaled a pause in further cuts pending clearer signals on labor market trends and inflation, which remains 'relatively high.' The Fed has cut rates three times this year. Chair Jerome Powell told reporters that the labor market 'appears to face significant downside risks,' noting that non-agricultural employment estimates remain overstated. In September, the Bureau of Labor Statistics revised its estimate of jobs added over the 12 months ending in March downward by approximately 911,000, or an average of 76,000 fewer jobs per month. The final revision of the employment benchmark will be released in February alongside the January employment report. The November employment report, delayed by a 43-day government shutdown, is scheduled for release next Tuesday and will include October employment data. However, the unemployment rate for October will not be available due to the inability to collect household survey data during the shutdown. Labor market slowdowns are attributed by economists to declining immigration levels, tariffs on imports, and the growing use of artificial intelligence reducing labor demand. Weekly continuing claims, a sign of employment stability, fell by 99,000 to 1.838 million after seasonal adjustment for the week ending November 29. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rate rose to 4.4% in September from 4.3% in August. The Federal Reserve's new economic projections estimate the unemployment rate at 4.5% for 2025, with a slight decline to 4.4% in 2026, unchanged from September forecasts.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 11, 2025 03:01 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062d\u064a\u0641\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0642 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0648\u0633\u0637](https://aawsat.com/node/5218418)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
