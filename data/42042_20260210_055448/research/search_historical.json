A quicker realization of efficiency gains could lead to stronger GDP growth than expected.\"\n\n## Context on Business Sentiment:\n- Business uncertainty driven by quickly changing trade policies and tariffs\n- \"Businesses are hesitant to make sweeping changes to either grow or shrink their payrolls when they're unsure what the next six months might hold\"\n- Layoff and hiring rates have been low\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.newsweek.com/map-shows-where-unemployment-is-rising-and-falling-in-the-us-11431300\">\n## Summary of Article: \"Map shows where unemployment is rising and falling in the US\"\n\n**Source:** Newsweek\n\n### Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **December 2025 State-Level Changes (Preliminary BLS Data):**\n   - Unemployment fell in 8 states month-over-month\n   - Increased in 21 states\n   - Remained flat in 22 states\n\n2. **National Unemployment Rate:**\n   - December 2025: 4.4%\n   - November 2025 (revised): 4.5%\n   - December 2024: 4.0% (implied by \"0.4 percent higher than last January\")\n\n3. **Job Growth:**\n   - December 2025: 50,000 jobs added\n   - November 2025: 56,000 jobs added\n   - Consensus expectation for December: 60,000\n   - 2025 was the weakest year for job growth since 2020\n   - No month in 2025 saw more than 168,000 jobs added (which was the average monthly increase in 2024)\n\n4. **State-Specific Rates (December 2025):**\n   - Lowest: Hawaii and South Dakota at 2.2% each (Hawaii improved 0.8 points year-over-year)\n   - Highest: Washington D.C. at 6.7% (up 1.4 points year-over-year)\n   - California: 5.5%\n   - New Jersey: 5.4%\n   - Largest year-over-year increases: Delaware (+1.6 points), D.C.

Plateau at a mid-4 % level:   The jobless rate drifted up 0.3 pp over the last twelve months (Dec-24 4.1 % \u2192 Dec-25 4.4 %). The rise was gradual, reflecting a \u201clow-hire, low-fire\u201d environment in which employers slowed recruiting but have not resorted to large layoffs (Indeed Hiring Lab, Nov-2025).\n2. Broad deceleration in labor demand: job openings are at their lowest since 2020, and payroll growth averaged only ~60 k/month in Q4-2025 (Investopedia, 10 Feb 2026).  \n3. Nonetheless, unemployment remains low by historical standards (post-war average 5.7 %).\n\nProfessional forecasts for March-2026 (to be reported 3 Apr 2026)\nExplicit March-2026 point forecasts are scarce, but several institutions provide quarterly or 2026-average projections that bracket where the rate is likely to stand in March:\n\n\u2022 Blue Chip/Indeed Hiring Lab \u201cconsensus scenario\u201d for end-2026: 4.4 % (range 4.1\u20134.8 %) (Indeed Hiring Lab, Nov-2025). With no recession assumed, their path implies the rate hugging the mid-4 % area through mid-year, including March.\n\n\u2022 Deloitte Economics baseline: 4.5 % for CY-2026 (Deloitte Q4-2025 forecast). Their quarterly path shows the rate moving only a tenth above current levels early in the year and stabilising\u2014again consistent with ~4.5 % in March.\n\n\u2022 Vanguard (via Investopedia interview, 10 Feb 2026): projects a 2026 decline to 4.2 % as AI-related investment revives hiring. Translating that to a time-profile, Vanguard expects slippage below today\u2019s 4.4 % as early as Q2; March would therefore straddle 4.3-4.4 %.\n\n\u2022 FactSet consensus for Jan-2026 (4.4 %) plus commentary from PNC and Nationwide that \u201clittle change\u201d is expected in coming months (Morningstar, 5 Feb 2026) suggests that most private forecasters see the unemployment rate remaining flat into the spring.\n\nSynthesising the above, the professional range for March-2026 is 4.3 %\u20134.6 %, with the weight of opinion clustered around 4.4-4.5 %.\n\nHistorical late-cycle comparisons\n\n1. 2006-08 (pre-Great Recession):\n   \u2022 Unemployment averaged 4.6 % in 2006, edged up to 5.0 % by April-2008 and then climbed rapidly to 7.3 % by December-2008.  \n   \u2022 Current conditions resemble the early stage of that episode\u2014rate hovering in the mid-4 % zone for a year\u2014before the spike. So far, however, today\u2019s rise is much tamer (only +0.3 pp y/y) and is not accompanied by surging initial claims or mass layoffs.\n\n2. 2018-20 (pre-pandemic):\n   \u2022 Unemployment stood at 3.8 % in 2018 and reached a 50-year low of 3.5 % in late-2019/Feb-2020.  \n   \u2022 Compared with that period, today\u2019s 4.4 % signifies a labour market that has already loosened by roughly 0.9 pp, reflecting slower hiring, tighter immigration policy and higher tariffs (Morningstar; Deloitte).\n\n3. Other labour-slack indicators:\n   \u2022 Underemployment (people working part-time for economic reasons) spiked after 2008 but, unlike then, has fallen back in line with unemployment post-COVID, suggesting less hidden slack today (Cleveland Fed Commentary, 2022).  \n   \u2022 The diffusion index of payroll growth (50.8 in Dec-2025; Morningstar) is barely above the 50 cutoff, versus the broad-based strength seen in 2019.\n\nKey drivers shaping the 2026 outlook\n\u2022 Immigration policy: restrictions are holding down labour-force growth and keeping the unemployment rate from rising faster (Morningstar; Deloitte).  \n\u2022 Tariffs: higher input costs and uncertainty have curbed hiring plans, but they also tamp labour supply, creating offsetting effects (Investopedia, 10 Feb 2026; Deloitte).  \n\u2022 AI investment cycle: forecasters diverge on whether AI will spur a hiring rebound (Vanguard) or, in a downside scenario, trigger a capex pull-back and higher unemployment later in 2027 (Deloitte).  \n\u2022 Fiscal policy: 2026 tax cuts (\u201cOne Big, Beautiful Bill\u201d) could boost demand and payrolls (Investopedia/Vanguard).\n\nTake-aways\n\u2022 Latest confirmed U-3 = 4.4 % (Dec-25). January-26 is expected to match that figure; forecasts for March-26 cluster around 4.4-4.5 %.  \n\u2022 The labour market has cooled from the exceptionally tight 2018-19 conditions but is far from recessionary levels.  \n\u2022 Compared with the 2006-07 late-cycle plateau, the current drift appears milder and less synchronized with rapid job-loss indicators, yet vigilance is warranted as policy shocks (tariffs, AI investment swings, immigration) create two-sided risks.\n\nRemaining information gaps\n1. The actual January-2026 unemployment rate will only be known on 11 Feb 2026; without it we cannot confirm whether the consensus was accurate.  \n2. There are no publicly available, high-frequency forecasts specifically for March-2026 from the Fed or CBO; only annual/quarterly averages are published.  \n3. A precise historical data table for 2006-08 and 2018-20 monthly unemployment would sharpen the quantitative comparison.\n\nIf deeper precision is required, new queries aimed at \u201cBlue Chip March 2026 unemployment survey\u201d, \u201cCBO January 2026 economic projection unemployment path\u201d, or pulling full historical monthly UNRATE data for 2006-08 and 2018-20 from FRED would close those gaps.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"UNRATE\" query=\"UNRATE\">\nFRED Economic Data: Unemployment Rate\nSeries ID: UNRATE\nUnits: Percent\nFrequency: Monthly\nLatest observation: 4.40 (2025-12-01)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=4.25, min=4.00, max=4.50\n- 5-year: mean=4.18, min=3.40, max=6.40\n- 10-year: mean=4.58, min=3.40, max=14.80\n- All-time: mean=5.67, min=2.50, max=14.80 (since 1948-01-01)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: -0.10 (-2.2%)\n- 3-month change: +0.00 (+0.0%)\n- 6-month change: +0.30 (+7.3%)\n- Year-over-year: 4.40 vs 4.10 (+7.3%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Monthly):\nDate,Value\n2024-12-01,4.10\n2025-01-01,4.00\n2025-02-01,4.20\n2025-03-01,4.20\n2025-04-01,4.20\n2025-05-01,4.30\n2025-06-01,4.10\n2025-07-01,4.30\n2025-08-01,4.30\n2025-09-01,4.40\n2025-11-01,4.50\n2025-12-01,4.40\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
