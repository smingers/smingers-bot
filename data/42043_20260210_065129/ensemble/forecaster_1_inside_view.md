## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Current price stabilization**: Multiple independent sources (EIA, AAA, GasBuddy) confirm national average at $2.84-2.90/gal as of early February 2026. This represents stabilization after 6-month decline.
2. **Seasonal pattern confirmation**: Patrick De Haan (GasBuddy) explicitly states seasonal factors driving spring increases, with West Coast transitioning to summer-grade gasoline. Historical patterns show March typically 2-5% above January.
3. **Futures market signal**: March 2026 RBOB futures at $1.9855/gal wholesale implies retail around $2.65-2.75/gal, but this is for wholesale delivery, not retail monthly average.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **EIA Q1 2026 forecast**: $2.85/gal for entire Q1 (Jan-Mar average). Since January was $2.81, this implies February-March averaging $2.87-2.89 to reach Q1 average.
2. **Recent momentum shift**: After 6 months of declines, prices have stabilized/slightly increased in early February (+3-5 cents in most regions week-over-week).
3. **Supply-demand dynamics**: EIA notes decreasing refinery capacity (West Coast closures) creating upward pressure on margins, partially offset by declining demand.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Venezuela oil production**: Multiple sources mention potential impact, but De Haan explicitly states this won't affect 2026 prices materially.
2. **OPEC+ production pause**: Extended through March 2026, but global oversupply projected by IEA (3.8M bpd surplus).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** March 2026 is 3-5 weeks away (mid-February to end of March). The question asks for the monthly average, which will be published by EIA in late April 2026.

**If timeframe halved (2-3 weeks to mid-March):** Would increase confidence in current price levels ($2.85-2.95 range) as less time for seasonal factors to accumulate. Would narrow distribution slightly.

**If timeframe doubled (6-10 weeks to late April):** Would need to account for full spring refinery maintenance season and potential early summer demand. Would widen distribution toward upside ($3.00-3.20 range more likely) and increase uncertainty.

**Current timeframe implications:** March captures transition period between winter lows and spring maintenance season. Sufficient time for seasonal uplift but not full summer peak effects.

## (d) Justification

**Key shifts from outside view:**

1. **Current price level higher than January baseline**: Outside view used January $2.81 as starting point, but current prices (Feb 9) are already $2.84-2.90. This is strong evidence that the seasonal uplift is already beginning, suggesting March will be higher still.

2. **EIA Q1 forecast constraint**: EIA's $2.85/gal Q1 average, combined with January actual of $2.81, mathematically implies February-March must average around $2.87-2.89 to achieve this. Since we're already at $2.90 in early February, March likely needs to be $2.88-2.95 to balance.

3. **Seasonal momentum confirmed**: Multiple sources document week-over-week increases in early February, with De Haan explicitly citing seasonal factors and summer-blend transition. This validates the seasonal uplift assumption.

4. **Futures market calibration**: March RBOB at $1.9855 wholesale translates to approximately $2.65-2.75 retail, but this is the contract settlement price, not the monthly average. Retail prices typically run higher and show more volatility.

**Distribution shifts justified:**
- Upward shift of central tendency from outside view ($2.90-2.95) to $2.92-2.98 based on current prices already at $2.90
- Slightly narrower distribution due to proximity to target month reducing uncertainty
- Maintained upside tail risk for refinery disruptions or demand surprises

## Distribution Calibration

**Current state (Feb 9):** $2.90/gal national average

**March trajectory:**
- Base case: Continued modest seasonal increase of 2-3 cents, reaching $2.92-2.95
- Optimistic (for consumers): Momentum stalls, prices hold at $2.88-2.90
- Pessimistic: Seasonal factors accelerate, refinery issues push toward $3.05-3.15

**Calibration factors:**
1. **Anchoring to current price**: With March 3-5 weeks away and prices at $2.90, significant deviation seems unlikely absent major shock
2. **EIA constraint**: Q1 average of $2.85 with Jan at $2.81 implies Feb-Mar around $2.87-2.89, but current Feb prices suggest this may be slightly low
3. **GasBuddy May peak**: $3.12 forecast suggests gradual climb through spring, implying March in $2.95-3.05 range
4. **Historical volatility**: Monthly changes typically ±$0.10-0.15, with tail events ±$0.20-0.30

**Distribution construction:**
- P10: $2.75 - Represents unexpected demand weakness or supply surge
- P20: $2.82 - Prices stabilize near current levels with minimal seasonal lift
- P40: $2.90 - Modest increase from current $2.90, reaching $2.92-2.93
- P60: $2.98 - Typical seasonal pattern with 3-5% increase from January
- P80: $3.08 - Stronger seasonal factors or minor supply disruption
- P90: $3.20 - Refinery outage, geopolitical event, or early summer demand surge

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: US national average retail price for regular gasoline in March 2026 (monthly average), in USD/gallon, per EIA data.

2. **Outside view base rate**: P10: 2.70, P50: 2.94, P90: 3.25. My inside view shifts slightly upward (P50: 2.94→2.94) due to current prices already at $2.90, but maintains similar range width.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = $2.94; mean ≈ $2.96. This aligns with EIA annual forecast ($2.92), GasBuddy forecast ($2.97), and represents modest seasonal increase from current $2.90 level.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - Current national average at $2.90 (Feb 9) from multiple sources (AAA, GasBuddy)
   - EIA Q1 2026 forecast of $2.85/gal average implies March near $2.88-2.95
   - Seasonal spring pattern confirmed by expert De Haan; week-over-week increases documented
   - GasBuddy May peak forecast of $3.12 suggests gradual March-May climb
   - March RBOB futures at $1.99/gal wholesale (implies retail $2.65-2.80, but monthly average typically higher)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Major refinery outage on Gulf Coast or California during March maintenance season could spike prices to $3.30-3.50 (upward). Alternatively, unexpected demand collapse or OPEC production surge could push toward $2.60-2.70 (downward). Refinery risk seems more probable given West Coast capacity constraints mentioned by EIA.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Current price of $2.90 represents reasonable status quo. Given 3-5 week timeframe and documented seasonal patterns, modest movement to $2.92-2.98 seems most likely. Volatility is moderate (not high) given stable crude markets and no major geopolitical shocks currently.

7. **Technicalities**: All values in USD/gallon, strictly increasing, within bounds (1.5-7.5). Values align with resolution criteria (EIA monthly average for March 2026).
