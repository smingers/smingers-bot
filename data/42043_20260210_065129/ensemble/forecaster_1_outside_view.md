## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **March prices in recent years (2020-2025):**
   - Suitable because captures seasonal patterns and recent market conditions
   - March typically falls in spring refinery maintenance period before summer blend switch
   - Recent data: March 2025 = $3.10/gal

2. **Monthly prices during declining price environments:**
   - Moderately suitable - captures momentum effects
   - Current trend shows 6-month decline of 10.1%

3. **Prices 2 months after January readings:**
   - Most suitable - directly comparable timeframe
   - January 2026 = $2.81; need to estimate typical Jan-to-March change

**Selected Reference Class:** January-to-March price changes in recent years, adjusted for current market conditions.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** March 2026 is approximately 1.5 months away (mid-February to mid-March average).

**Historical January-to-March Patterns:**
- Jan 2025 ($3.08) → Mar 2025 ($3.10): +$0.02 (+0.6%)
- Jan 2024 → Mar 2024: Seasonal uptick typical as refineries prepare for summer blend
- Jan 2023 → Mar 2023: Similar seasonal pattern

**Current Context:**
- Strong downward momentum: -$0.36 over last 6 months (-10.1%)
- January 2026 at $2.81, already below both GasBuddy ($2.97) and EIA ($2.92) annual forecasts
- Seasonal factors: March typically sees modest increases due to refinery maintenance reducing supply before summer driving season

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Calculation:**
Starting from January 2026 at $2.81/gal, I need to account for:

1. **Seasonal uplift:** March typically runs $0.05-0.15 higher than January due to spring refinery maintenance and anticipation of summer blend switch. GasBuddy forecasts May peak at $3.12, suggesting gradual spring increase.

2. **Momentum vs. Seasonality:** Current strong downward trend (-10.1% over 6 months) conflicts with typical seasonal spring increase. However, prices appear to be stabilizing around $2.80-2.85 range.

3. **Expert Forecasts Convergence:** 
   - GasBuddy: $2.97 annual average with May peak at $3.12
   - EIA: $2.92 annual average
   - Both suggest March should be in the $2.85-3.05 range (below May peak, above December low)

4. **Futures Market:** April 2026 RBOB at $2.20/gal wholesale suggests retail around $2.85-3.00/gal (adding typical $0.65-0.80 markup).

5. **Historical Volatility:** Gasoline prices show significant month-to-month volatility. Standard deviation over past year is approximately $0.15-0.20.

**Central Estimate:** $2.90-2.95/gal, representing modest seasonal increase from January's $2.81 while remaining consistent with annual forecasts.

## Outside View Calibration

**Distribution Considerations:**

1. **Tethering to established forecasts:** Both major forecasters (GasBuddy, EIA) project annual averages of $2.92-2.97, with March falling in spring shoulder season.

2. **Tail risks:**
   - Downside: Continued momentum could push toward $2.70-2.75 if demand remains weak
   - Upside: Geopolitical shock, refinery outage, or early summer demand could push toward $3.20-3.30
   - Historical upset rate: Approximately 15-20% of months see unexpected moves >$0.20

3. **Range width:** Given recent 6-month range of $2.81-3.17 ($0.36 spread) and typical monthly volatility, 10th-90th percentile should span approximately $0.50-0.60.

4. **Asymmetry:** Slight upside bias due to seasonal factors and stabilization after recent declines.
