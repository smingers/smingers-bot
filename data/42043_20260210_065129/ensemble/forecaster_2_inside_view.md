Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**High-Quality Government/Official Sources:**
1. **EIA STEO (January 2025)** - Factual, authoritative. Projects Q1 2026 at $2.85/gal, annual 2026 at $2.92/gal. Published before current date, so these are forecasts not observations.
2. **EIA historical data** - Gold standard for actual historical prices. Shows 2025 average was $3.10/gal.
3. **AAA daily tracking (Feb 9, 2026)** - Current national average $2.90/gal. Highly reliable real-time data.

**Industry Expert Analysis:**
4. **Patrick De Haan (GasBuddy)** - Identifiable expert with strong track record. Multiple articles quote him projecting 2026 average of $2.97/gal, with seasonal rise expected starting March. Notes spring demand increase and summer-blend gasoline transition (more expensive) typically occurs in April in Northeast.
5. **RBOB futures (Feb 9, 2026)** - March 2026 contract at $1.9855/gal wholesale. This translates to roughly $2.80-3.00 retail after typical markups.

**Current Price Data (Feb 9, 2026):**
6. Multiple sources confirm national average is $2.89-2.90/gal currently, up slightly from $2.74 in early January but down $0.23-0.28 YoY.
7. Regional variation significant: Oklahoma $2.32, California $4.48.

**Key Factual Observations:**
- January 2026 ended at approximately $2.81/gal (FRED data)
- Current price (Feb 9) is $2.90/gal
- Prices have risen 9 cents in past month (late Jan to early Feb)
- Historical pattern: March typically 5-10% higher than January due to seasonal demand

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **EIA official forecast**: Q1 2026 = $2.85/gal (March is in Q1). This is a direct, authoritative projection from the primary government source. However, this was published in January before the recent uptick.
2. **Current trajectory**: Prices rose from $2.74 (Jan 5) to $2.90 (Feb 9) = +16 cents in 5 weeks. If this continues linearly through March, we'd reach ~$3.05 by mid-March.
3. **Seasonal pattern**: Multiple experts (De Haan, AAA) confirm spring demand increase and summer-blend transition create upward pressure starting late February/March.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **RBOB futures**: March contract at $1.9855/gal wholesale suggests retail around $2.85-3.00 range, accounting for typical $0.85-1.00 markup.
2. **Supply fundamentals**: EIA projects global oversupply in 2026 (3.8M bpd surplus per IEA), crude oil at $55/bbl. This supports lower prices structurally but doesn't override seasonal factors.
3. **Refinery dynamics**: West Coast refinery closures (Phillips 66 LA) create regional upward pressure, but national impact is modest.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. Geopolitical stability (Venezuela, Middle East) remains uncertain but no imminent disruptions indicated.
2. Weather patterns (warmer winter) reduced heating oil demand but minimal direct gasoline impact.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Time to resolution**: 49 days until March 2026 begins; the question asks for the monthly average for all of March.

**Current position**: We are 19 days into February. Historical data shows:
- January 2026: ~$2.81/gal (month average)
- Early February 2026: $2.90/gal (current)
- Trend: +9 cents over ~5 weeks = +1.8 cents/week

**Seasonal dynamics**: March historically runs 5-10% above January due to:
- Rising driving demand as weather warms
- Refineries transitioning to summer-blend (April in Northeast, earlier in some regions)
- Spring break travel

**If timeframe halved (March 1-15 only)**: Would likely show lower prices, as the summer-blend transition typically accelerates mid-to-late March. Early March often still reflects winter pricing.

**If timeframe doubled (Feb-April average)**: Would show higher average, as April typically peaks higher than March due to full summer-blend implementation.

## (d) Justification

**Base rate adjustment rationale:**

The outside view centered on $2.90 with 10th/90th percentiles of $2.20-4.00 based on historical March prices adjusted for structural drift. Current circumstances warrant moderate upward adjustment:

1. **Current level already at base rate**: At $2.90 today (Feb 9), we're already at the outside view median. With 3 weeks until March and historical seasonal rise of 5-10%, the central tendency should shift upward to $3.00-3.10.

2. **Strong seasonal pattern**: The spring demand increase is a highly reliable, recurring phenomenon. Every expert source confirms this. March 2026 is unlikely to be an exception given:
   - Normal weather patterns (no extreme cold/heat disrupting demand)
   - Stable economic conditions (no recession)
   - Typical refinery operations

3. **EIA forecast alignment**: EIA's Q1 projection of $2.85/gal was made in January when prices were $2.74. The actual trajectory has been slightly higher (+16 cents vs. +11 cents projected). This suggests March could land at $2.95-3.05 rather than $2.85.

4. **Futures market signal**: RBOB March futures at $1.9855 wholesale translate to ~$2.90-3.00 retail, supporting a central estimate around $3.00.

5. **Limited downside risk**: With crude oil structurally oversupplied and no major geopolitical disruptions imminent, catastrophic price spikes (>$4.00) are unlikely. However, the seasonal floor is also firm—prices rarely decline in March.

**Why this isn't a dramatic shift**: The outside view already incorporated seasonality through the historical March distribution. Current evidence confirms we're tracking the typical seasonal pattern, not deviating from it. The adjustment from $2.90 to $3.00-3.05 median reflects:
- Starting point already at previous median
- Confirmed seasonal momentum
- Expert consensus alignment

## Distribution Calibration

**Central tendency**: Given current price of $2.90 and 3 weeks of expected seasonal rise at ~2 cents/week, March average should center around $2.95-3.05. I'll use $3.00 as median.

**Downside scenarios (10th-40th percentiles)**:
- 10th percentile ($2.50): Requires unexpected demand collapse or major supply surge. Possible but unlikely given stable fundamentals. This is 17% below current price—historically rare for a 3-week forward period.
- 20th percentile ($2.70): Modest demand weakness or accelerated supply. Represents prices staying flat or declining slightly from current levels.
- 40th percentile ($2.90): Status quo—prices remain at current level through March, no seasonal rise materializes.

**Upside scenarios (60th-90th percentiles)**:
- 60th percentile ($3.10): Normal seasonal rise continues, summer-blend transition begins earlier than typical.
- 80th percentile ($3.35): Stronger demand, refinery issues, or modest supply disruption. Still within historical March range.
- 90th percentile ($3.70): Significant supply disruption (refinery outage, geopolitical shock) or demand surge. Approaches but doesn't exceed 2022 levels.

**Tail considerations**: 
- Lower bound ($1.50): Extremely unlikely. Would require complete demand collapse—no historical precedent for 45% drop in 3 weeks.
- Upper bound ($7.50): Also extremely unlikely. Even 2022 peak was $4.24. Would require multiple simultaneous catastrophic supply disruptions.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: US national monthly average retail price for regular gasoline in March 2026, measured in $/gallon by EIA.

2. **Base rate**: Outside view centered on $2.90 (10th: $2.20, 90th: $4.00). Current price already at $2.90; seasonal patterns warrant modest upward shift to $3.00 median.

3. **Consistency**: Implied median = $3.00; mean ≈ $3.05. This aligns with current price + seasonal rise + expert forecasts + futures market.

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - Current national average $2.90/gal (Feb 9), up 16¢ from early January
   - EIA Q1 2026 forecast $2.85/gal; actual trajectory running slightly higher
   - Seasonal spring demand rise confirmed by multiple experts (De Haan, AAA)
   - RBOB March futures $1.9855/gal wholesale → ~$2.90-3.00 retail
   - Historical pattern: March averages 5-10% above January

5. **Blind spot**: Unexpected refinery outage or geopolitical shock (Iran/Middle East) could spike prices to $3.50-4.00+. Conversely, sudden demand collapse (recession) could drop to $2.60-2.70.

6. **Status quo**: Current price $2.90. Given 3-week timeframe and strong seasonal pattern, modest rise to $3.00-3.10 is more likely than flat. Volatility is moderate—not a crisis period.

7. **Technicalities**: Values strictly increasing, units in USD/gallon, all within bounds [1.5, 7.5].
