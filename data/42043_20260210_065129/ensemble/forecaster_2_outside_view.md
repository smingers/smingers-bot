## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **March prices in recent years (2020-2025):** Captures seasonal patterns and recent market conditions
2. **Prices 1-2 months after January readings:** Shows typical January-to-March movement
3. **All monthly prices in declining market phases:** Broader historical context

**Most suitable: March prices in recent stable/declining years (2023-2025) with adjustment for current trajectory**

Historical March values (from typical seasonal patterns):
- March typically sees increases from winter lows due to refinery maintenance and summer blend switchover
- However, 2026 shows unusual weakness with January already at $2.81

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** March 2026 is approximately 3-7 weeks away (mid-February to end of March)

**Historical January-to-March patterns:**
- Seasonal tendency: Prices typically rise 10-20 cents from January to March due to:
  - Refinery maintenance season
  - Switch to summer gasoline blends (begins in some regions)
  - Demand pickup as weather improves

**Current context (January 2026 = $2.81):**
- Strong downward momentum: -$0.36 from April 2025 to January 2026
- Year-over-year decline: -8.7%
- GasBuddy expects spring peak in May (~$3.12), suggesting March would be transitional

**Typical January-March movement:**
Looking at seasonal patterns, March is usually 5-15 cents higher than January, but 2026's weak fundamentals may dampen this.

## (d) Justification

**Base rate from current data:**
- January 2026: $2.81/gal (actual)
- Seasonal adjustment: +$0.05 to +$0.15 typical for Jan-Mar
- Expected range without shocks: $2.86-$2.96

**Expert forecasts alignment:**
- GasBuddy annual average: $2.97, with May peak at $3.12
- EIA annual average: $2.92
- March should be below May peak but above winter lows
- Interpolating between January ($2.81) and May ($3.12): March likely $2.90-$3.00

**Market signals:**
- RBOB April futures at $2.20/gal suggest wholesale prices remain weak
- Retail typically runs $0.60-$0.80 above wholesale
- This supports $2.80-$3.00 range

**Risk factors:**
- Geopolitical shocks (Middle East, Russia-Ukraine)
- Unexpected refinery outages
- Weather disruptions
- Stronger than expected demand

**Synthesis:**
Central tendency around $2.90-$2.95, with seasonal increase from January's $2.81 but remaining well below 2025 levels. The strong downward trend and weak fundamentals argue against a sharp spring rally, but normal seasonal patterns suggest some increase.

## Outside View Calibration

**Anchoring considerations:**
- January 2026 actual: $2.81
- Historical volatility: Monthly changes rarely exceed $0.30 in stable periods
- Expert consensus: Annual average $2.92-$2.97 suggests March in similar range
- Seasonal pattern: March typically 5-15 cents above January

**Distribution shape:**
- Central mass: $2.85-$3.00 (70% probability)
- Lower tail: Continued decline possible if demand weakens or crude crashes
- Upper tail: Geopolitical shock or supply disruption could spike prices

**Tail risk assessment:**
- 10th percentile: Account for continued decline or demand shock → $2.70
- 90th percentile: Account for geopolitical event or supply shock → $3.15

**Calibration checks:**
- Range width: $0.45 (10th to 90th) represents ~16% variation, reasonable for 6-week forecast
- Asymmetry: Slight upward skew due to geopolitical tail risks
- Historical upset rate: Major price shocks occur ~10-15% of the time in monthly data
