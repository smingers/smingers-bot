Analysis:
**1) Target / resolution criteria (paraphrase)**  
Forecast the **EIA “U.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices” monthly average for March 2026**, in **USD per gallon**.

## (a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; date; fact vs opinion)
- **EIA STEO-based reporting (Rigzone, Jan 22, 2026)**: High-quality secondary reporting of **EIA’s identifiable forecast**. Key factual inputs: **2026 annual avg $2.92** and **Q1 2026 avg $2.85**. Good anchor; not March-specific.
- **EIA Today in Energy (Jan 22, 2025)**: High-quality but **older** discussion of drivers (crude, refinery capacity, margins). Useful structurally, but dated for March 2026.
- **IndexBox blog (Jan 2025 STEO-based, about production)**: Indirect and dated. Relevant only insofar as it supports “ample supply” narratives; weak for a one-month retail forecast.
- **EIA Winter fuels outlook article (Dec 15, 2025)**: Reliable EIA context, but mainly about heating fuels; only indirectly related via weather/economic demand conditions.
- **AskNews: many local/consumer pieces (Patch, CBS Detroit, WBMA, etc., Feb 8–9, 2026)**: Mostly **factual snapshots** (AAA/GasBuddy averages around **$2.84–$2.90** nationally). Good “nowcast” for early-Feb; limited forward-looking content.
- **AskNews: GasBuddy analyst quotes (KVAL, NorthJersey, Automotive-fleet, Jan–Feb 2026)**: Industry expert (Patrick De Haan). Forward-looking statements like “seasonal rise late Feb/early March,” and possibility of national average **exceeding $3** for part of spring. This is **expert opinion**, but from a named, track-recorded source.
- **AskNews: AP futures settlement (Feb 9, 2026)**: High-quality factual market data: **WTI Mar 2026 ~$64.36/bbl** and **RBOB Mar 2026 ~$1.9855/gal**. This is a strong, timely signal for wholesale conditions, though retail pass-through is imperfect and taxed/regulated.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
**Strong evidence**
- **Current observed retail level**: Multiple independent sources (AAA/GasBuddy in several articles) put early-Feb national average around **$2.84–$2.90**. That strongly constrains March unless there’s a sharp move.
- **Seasonality**: Historically robust: late-winter lows then rising into spring (maintenance, demand pick-up, early summer-blend effects).

**Moderate evidence**
- **EIA STEO Q1 2026 avg ~$2.85** (published mid-Jan): A coherent model-based forecast, but (i) not March-specific, (ii) can miss turning points, and (iii) conditions may have drifted since mid-January.
- **Futures (WTI/RBOB)**: Informative about upstream/wholesale price pressure; suggests **no acute tightness** (i.e., not screaming $3.50+ retail), but retail margins/taxes/regionals can still lift prices.

**Weak evidence**
- **Broad “oversupply / weak demand / EV transition” narratives**: Directionally plausible but not decisive for a single month 3–7 weeks ahead.
- **Non-gasoline macro articles (e.g., silver, COLA explainer)**: Essentially irrelevant.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Today:** 2026-02-10.  
- **Forecast month:** March 2026 (monthly average), so we’re **~3 to ~7 weeks** ahead of most March prices being realized; resolution by late April.
- If the horizon were **halved** (forecasting late Feb instead of March), I’d narrow uncertainty and pull the distribution slightly **down** (less seasonal ramp).  
- If **doubled** (forecasting April/May), I’d widen the upper tail and shift central estimates **up** (stronger seasonal rise risk).

## (d) Justification (inside view vs outside view)
**Outside-view baseline (given):** centered around ~$2.90–$2.96 with moderate upside tail.

**Key inside-view adjustments:**
1. **“Nowcast anchor” is already near $2.90 in early Feb.** For March monthly average to land near $2.85 would require either a sustained drop soon or that early-Feb readings are temporarily high. Possible, but the preponderance of seasonal patterns argues against a big decline into March.
2. **Seasonal ramp late Feb → March** is repeatedly flagged by GasBuddy commentary and is consistent with historical maintenance/blend transition dynamics. This pushes the **median modestly upward** versus the outside view.
3. **Futures (WTI ~$64, RBOB ~$1.99)** imply a relatively contained wholesale environment—so I’m not moving the whole distribution sharply upward. Instead, I modestly raise the center while keeping a meaningful (but not huge) upside tail for outages/geopolitics.

Net: **small upward shift in central quantiles** (relative to outside view), **raise the lower quantiles** (because current prices are already near $2.90), and **widen/raise the upper tail** a bit to respect disruption risk during maintenance season.

Distribution calibration
- **Trend-continued outcome:** If prices hover near ~$2.90 and climb modestly with seasonality, March average around **$2.95–$3.05**.
- **Low scenario (pulls 10th–20th down):** crude dips sharply / demand stays unusually weak / margins compress → March average closer to **high-$2.70s to mid-$2.80s**.
- **High scenario (pushes 80th–90th up):** refinery outage(s), sharper spring blend cost jump, geopolitical shock lifting crude → **low-$3.10s to low-$3.30s**.

Checklist:
1) **Variable:** EIA monthly average *U.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices* for **March 2026**, **USD/gal**.  
2) **Outside view distribution:** P10 2.70, P20 2.80, P40 2.90, P60 2.96, P80 3.05, P90 3.15.  
3) **Consistency:** Implied median ≈ (2.93+3.01)/2 = **2.97**; mean ≈ **2.99**; consistent with early-Feb ~$2.9 and mild seasonal rise.  
4) **Top evidence (3–5):**
   - Early-Feb national retail averages around **$2.84–$2.90** (AAA/GasBuddy repeated across sources).  
   - **Seasonal rise** expected late Feb/early March (GasBuddy + historical pattern).  
   - **EIA STEO** indicates low overall 2026 pricing (Q1 avg ~$2.85; annual ~$2.92).  
   - **WTI/RBOB futures** indicate no extreme wholesale tightness (WTI ~$64; RBOB ~$1.99 on Feb 9).  
5) **Blind spot:** A sudden major geopolitical supply shock or major multi-refinery outage could push March average **materially higher** (>$3.30).  
6) **Status quo:** “Near $2.90 with gradual spring lift” remains the modal path.  
7) **Technicalities:** Percentiles strictly increasing; units USD/gal; within plausible bounds.
