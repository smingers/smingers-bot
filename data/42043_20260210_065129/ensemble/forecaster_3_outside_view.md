Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; facts vs opinions)

1. **EIA historical table (All Formulations, annual averages; release 2/3/2026)**
   - **Facts:** Annual averages: 2025 = **$3.097**, 2024 = $3.304, 2023 = $3.519, 2022 = $3.951, etc. Shows multi-year decline since 2022.
   - **Quality:** Very high (official EIA).  
   - **Limitations:** Annual averages only; the question resolves on **March 2026 monthly average**, so this is indirect evidence.

2. **FRED page for GASREGCOVW (weekly conventional regular)**
   - **Facts:** Mostly methodological metadata; no actual prices/forecast in the provided excerpt.
   - **Quality:** High as a metadata reference, but **not directly helpful** for March 2026 monthly average.

3. **EIA conventional gasoline retail sales table (different series; older; through 2010 shown)**
   - **Facts:** Historical annual averages, but different concept (“conventional gasoline… by all sellers”), and stale for our horizon.
   - **Quality:** EIA is high quality, but **series mismatch + outdated** → low usefulness here.

4. **GasBuddy 2026 forecast articles (Rigzone 1/14/2026; plus local-news rewrites)**
   - **Facts:** Reported current averages around **$2.84** (Jan 2026 snapshot). States forecasted **2026 annual average $2.97**, **May highest $3.12**, **December $2.83**.
   - **Opinions/interpretation:** Commentary from identifiable expert (Patrick De Haan) about drivers (refining capacity, supply chains, seasonal spring peak “low $3.20s”).
   - **Quality:** Medium. GasBuddy is a credible industry forecaster for retail prices, but these are **model-based forecasts** and the reprints may simplify. Still useful as an “expert baseline”.

5. **Agent report (compiled; includes FRED GASREGM, one RBOB futures point, STEO Jan-2026 summary)**
   - **Facts included:**  
     - FRED **GASREGM** shows **Jan 2026 = $2.81** (but this is **monthly end-of-period**, not monthly average).  
     - One cited **RBOB Apr-2026** futures quote around **$2.20/gal** (wholesale gasoline, not retail).  
     - STEO Jan-2026 projection: **2026 avg retail regular $2.92**.
   - **Quality:** Mixed. Useful aggregation, but some elements are incomplete (futures strip missing) and there’s a **concept mismatch** (wholesale futures vs retail; end-of-period vs monthly average). Still, STEO is an EIA product and typically high quality (even if only summarized here).

**Bottom line from sources:** Multiple semi-independent “institutional” baselines cluster around **$2.92–$2.97 for 2026 annual average**, with current early-2026 retail near **$2.8–$2.9** and an expectation of **spring uplift** into/through May.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view)

Plausible reference classes:
1. **Recent-year March monthly averages for U.S. regular all-formulations retail gasoline (e.g., 2015–2025).**
   - **Pros:** Directly matches month/seasonality and series definition.
   - **Cons:** Regime changes (2020 demand shock; 2022 supply shock) widen variance.

2. **“March relative to annual average” seasonal pattern, applied to an annual-average anchor (e.g., 2026 annual average forecast).**
   - **Pros:** Captures stable seasonality; robust even when level shifts.
   - **Cons:** Seasonality can vary depending on crude/refining shocks.

3. **Near-term extrapolation from current level (Jan/Feb 2026) plus typical Jan→Mar increase.**
   - **Pros:** Short horizon; relevant.
   - **Cons:** Needs a reliable current “monthly average” measure (we mostly have end-of-period / point-in-time).

**Most suitable outside-view approach:** (2) anchored by (1). I’ll treat March as typically modestly above the winter baseline and often near (or slightly above) the annual average, then anchor level using the consensus 2026 annual-average forecasts (~$2.92–$2.97).

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Today:** 2026-02-10  
- **Target:** **March 2026 monthly average**  
- **Time left:** ~3–7 weeks until March is complete (and ~7–11 weeks until EIA publishes the monthly figure, but publication lag doesn’t affect the actual March average).

Seasonally, U.S. gasoline prices often begin rising from winter into spring due to:
- refinery maintenance,
- transition toward summer blends,
- rising demand heading into driving season.

So, relative to January levels around the high-$2s, March typically trends higher, but usually not as high as late spring/early summer peaks.

### (d) Justification (outside view synthesis)

**Level anchor (annual-average):**
- EIA STEO (Jan-2026) implies **2026 avg ≈ $2.92**.
- GasBuddy implies **2026 avg ≈ $2.97**, with **May ≈ $3.12** and **Dec ≈ $2.83**.

**Seasonal placement:**
- If May is forecast around $3.12, March should usually sit meaningfully below May but above mid-winter lows. A rough seasonal step could put March about **$0.05–$0.20 below May**, suggesting something like **$2.90–$3.07** as a central band.

**Status quo if “nothing changes”:**
- With early-2026 retail around ~$2.8–$2.9 and the annual-average forecasts below $3, the status quo trajectory implies **March near $3.0** rather than mid-$3s.

**Uncertainty / “unknown unknowns”:**
- Gasoline prices can jump quickly on crude shocks, refinery outages, or geopolitical escalations, even in a short window; likewise can drop on demand scares/recession signals.
- That said, the horizon is short and we’re not in hurricane season, so extremely high tails (e.g., >$4.5) are possible but low probability in March absent a major shock.

So my outside-view center is around **$3.00/gal**, with a deliberately **wide** 10–90 interval to respect volatility.

---

Outside view calibration:

- I’m targeting a distribution that’s **not overly narrow** for a commodity-linked retail price even at a ~1–2 month horizon.
- I tether the center to the **institutional consensus annual average (~$2.92–$2.97)** and add a **spring seasonal uplift** from winter.
- I keep the upper tail meaningfully open (to reflect occasional sharp spikes), but not so wide that it implies frequent crisis-level prices within weeks.
