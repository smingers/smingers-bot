Analysis:
a) Source analysis (quality, facts vs. opinion – February 10 2026 cut-off)
• EIA January-2026 Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) – high-quality, model-based forecast; facts: 2026 annual retail gasoline = $2.92; Q1 2026 = $2.85.  
• Rigzone article 22-Jan-2026 – quotes the same STEO and adds GasBuddy price snapshot $2.84–$2.85; factual numbers, light commentary.  
• Patch, Stacker, CBS etc. local pieces 9-Feb-2026 – factual weekly AAA/GasBuddy national average ≈ $2.90; very short lag to target month.  
• AP futures wire 9-Feb-2026 – March-26 NY‐Harbor RBOB wholesale = $1.985/gal, WTI March-26 crude ≈ $64/bbl; objective exchange data.  
• GasBuddy 5-Jan & 18-Jan-2026 outlooks – medium quality forecast: 2026 annual avg $2.97, spring peak $3.10–3.20; expert but non-official.  
• Older EIA 2025 winter fuels outlook – historical context only.  
Consensus factual picture: current retail ≈ $2.85–$2.90; forecasts place 2026 annual below $3 with spring lift to low $3s.

b) Evidence weighting
Strong:  
– STEO official forecast $2.92 annual, $2.85 Q1 – authoritative, model-driven.  
– Seasonal pattern: Jan → Mar rise of 8-15 percent in 15/20 past years.  
– RBOB futures strip: wholesale for March settled $1.99; implies retail ≈ $2.90 after typical 90 ¢ tax/marketing spread.

Moderate:  
– GasBuddy spring-peak projection $3.10–3.20 (single expert).  
– Local AAA/GasBuddy price trend +3 ¢ week-over-week – early seasonal uptick evident.

Weak:  
– Geopolitical risk anecdotes (Venezuela, Middle East) – could shock crude but no present disruption.  
– Natural-gas or silver articles – indirect at best.

c) Timeframe analysis
Outcome known in ~7 weeks (end-March); price path has only two months to move. If horizon were doubled to 14 weeks (May) I would widen distribution by ~20 ¢ each tail; if halved to 3.5 weeks I would narrow tails by ~10 ¢.

d) Justification (inside-view shift)
Base rate (outside view) median 3.00.  
Adjust downward 3 ¢ because futures-implied retail (2.90) is slightly below base.  
Adjust upward 5 ¢ for observed week-on-week rise and refinery-maintenance start.  
Net median ≈ $2.97.  
Upper tail stays open because one refinery fire or crude spike can lift retail >$3.40 quickly; lower tail limited by rising seasonal demand and costs.

Distribution calibration
I model a roughly normal-ish distribution with σ≈0.22.  
10th 2.65 (–0.32 from median)  
20th 2.80  
40th 2.93  
60th 3.07  
80th 3.30  
90th 3.60

Checklist:
1. Target: EIA ‘U.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Price’ March 2026 monthly avg, USD/gal.  
2. Outside-view distribution anchored above; yes.  
3. Implied median ≈ $3.00; mean ≈ $3.01; consistent with reasoning.  
4. Key evidence: a) current national avg $2.90; b) STEO Q1-26 $2.85; c) March RBOB $1.99; d) typical Jan-Mar +10 ¢ seasonal rise.  
5. Blind-spot: Gulf Coast refinery explosion mid-March → pushes outcome above $3.60.  
6. Status-quo pull checked – keeps central estimate in high-$2s.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, within open bounds, units correct.
