Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. EIA STEO (Jan-13-26, Rigzone summary). Authoritative, government model.  Gives $2.92 annual-26, Q1-26 $2.85.  Pure forecast, no opinion.  
2. Weekly AAA/GasBuddy releases (Patch, Stacker, KVAL, WBMA, CBS-Detroit – all 9 Feb 26).  Real-time pump-price observations (~$2.90 national).  High factual value, minor editorial colour.  
3. RBOB futures settlement, AP “BC-OILS” (9 Feb 26).  Exchange data: Mar-26 RBOB $1.9855 / gal wholesale.  Top-tier market signal.  
4. GasBuddy 2026 Fuel Price Outlook (Jan-26 news citations).  Reputable private forecast, methodology public.  Gives 2026 avg $2.97, spring peak low-$3.20’s.  
5. EIA Today-in-Energy (Jan-22-25) & refinery-closure notes.  Explains structural capacity loss on West Coast—moderate, credible.  
No other sources materially alter near-term fundamentals.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Current national retail price $2.90 (AAA, GasBuddy, 9 Feb 26).  
• Historical Jan→Mar average rise +$0.22 (1990-2025 EIA data).  
Moderate evidence  
• Mar-26 RBOB futures imply retail ≈$2.80-2.90 after taxes/margins.  
• EIA Q1-26 retail forecast $2.85; GasBuddy spring peak ≈$3.20.  
Weak evidence  
• Headlines about Venezuela, OPEC+ uncertainty—effects unlikely inside 7-week window.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
49 days until March ends.  Halving window (24 days) would increase volatility and widen tails slightly; doubling window (98 days) would add hurricane season risk and fatten the upper tail.

(d) Justification / inside-view shifts  
Baseline (outside view) μ = $3.03, σ = $0.27.  
Updates:  
+ Current price already $2.90, up $0.09 from January; typical additional Feb→Mar climb ≈$0.10-$0.15.  
– Wholesale RBOB at <$2.00 points to softer retail margin than assumed in baseline.  
Net: nudge median down ≈$0.03 to $3.00.  Variance unchanged; trim extreme upside due to ample supply and lack of geopolitical shock premia.

Distribution calibration
Assume normal core with μ = $3.00, σ = $0.27, then slight tail compression on high side.  
Percentiles (rounded):  
10th 2.50  (≈ −1.9 σ)  
20th 2.65  (≈ −1.3 σ)  
40th 2.85  (≈ −0.6 σ)  
60th 3.00  (≈ +0.0 σ)  
80th 3.20  (≈ +0.7 σ)  
90th 3.45  (≈ +1.7 σ)

Checklist:
1. Target: EIA monthly average US regular gasoline price, March 2026, USD/gal.  
2. Outside view stated above.  
3. Implied median = 3.00, mean ≈ 3.01 – coherent with evidence.  
4. Key evidence: a) $2.90 current national avg; b) historical +$0.22 Jan→Mar; c) RBOB Mar-26 $1.99; d) EIA Q1-26 forecast $2.85.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden Gulf Coast refinery outage >1 Mb/d in March → pushes price >$3.50.  
6. Status quo tilt already incorporated (median only +$0.10 over current).  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units USD/gal; within open bounds.
