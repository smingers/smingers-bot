# Summary of GasBuddy 2026 USA Gasoline Price Forecast

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Annual Forecasts:**
- **2026 annual average U.S. gasoline price**: $2.97 per gallon (fourth consecutive annual decline, lowest since 2020)
- **2025 annual average**: $3.102 per gallon
- **Average household spending on gasoline in 2026**: $2,083 (lowest since 2021's $1,979)

**Monthly Forecasts for 2026:**
- **Highest month**: May at $3.12 per gallon
- **Lowest month**: December at $2.83 per gallon

- AAA average: $2.840 per gallon

## Named Source Opinions:

**Patrick De Haan, Head of Petroleum Analysis at GasBuddy:**
- Attributes the decline to "unwinding of post-pandemic market distortions, expanding global refining capacity, and more stable supply chains"
- Expects "traditional seasonal pattern" in 2026 with spring peak in "low $3.20 range" driven by summer gasoline switch and refinery maintenance
- Notes 2026 spring peak forecast to be lower than 2025, "signaling a softening market"
- Projects prices to decline steadily after June
- States "If the market avoids major surprises, sustained averages below $3 per gallon could become commonplace in the year ahead"
- Characterized 2025 as "a year of rare stability"

## Relevant Context:
The forecast does not provide a specific projection for **March 2026**, which is the month in question. The article only specifies May (highest at $3.12) and December (lowest at $2.83) as specific monthly forecasts.

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide historical monthly U.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices series, current RBOB gasoline futures curve through April 2026, and key points from the February 2026 EIA STEO gasoline price outlook.
Below is what can be assembled from the material returned so far, followed by the information that is still missing and what additional searches would be required.

1. Historical monthly U.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices  
   •  The FRED series GASREGM (“US Regular All Formulations Gas Price, Dollars / Gallon, monthly end-of-period”) provides the complete history back to September 1990.  
      – Latest value (Jan-2026): $2.81 / gal, down 8.7 % year-on-year (FRED series GASREGM).  
      – Selected recent values (end-of-period):  
        • Apr-2025 $3.17  • Jul-2025 $3.12  • Oct-2025 $3.06  • Dec-2025 $2.89  • Jan-2026 $2.81 (FRED GASREGM).  
      – Long-run statistics: all-time mean $2.26 / gal; historical minimum $0.92 / gal (Feb-1999); maximum $4.93 / gal (Jun-2022) (FRED GASREGM).  
   •  These data satisfy the “historical monthly price series” part of the query.

2. Current RBOB gasoline futures curve through April 2026  
   •  We have one point on the curve – the April 2026 NYMEX contract trading at $2.2024 / gal as of 1:41 a.m. EST (CNBC quote for @RB.2, expiring 31-Mar-2026).  
   •  However, no prices were returned for the intervening delivery months (Mar-2026, Feb-2026, …, prompt months in 2025-2024).  The CME Group landing page that was captured only describes contract specs and does not list the strip (CME Group RBOB page).  Consequently the complete curve cannot yet be plotted or tabulated from the material at hand.

3. Key points from the February 2026 EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) gasoline price outlook  
   •  The EIA has not yet released the February 2026 STEO – the agency website states “Next release date  February 10 2026” (EIA STEO petroleum products page, release dated 13-Jan-2026).  
   •  The most recent outlook available is the January 2026 STEO (released 13-Jan-2026).  Key gasoline take-aways from that report:  
      – EIA projects average U.S. retail regular gasoline price at $2.92 / gal for 2026, down 6 % (-$0.18) from 2025’s $3.10 / gal average (EIA STEO Jan-2026).  
      – Prices edge up to $2.95 / gal in 2027 as crude prices firm slightly and West Coast refinery capacity tightens (EIA STEO Jan-2026).  
      – 2026 decline driven mainly by lower crude oil prices, partially offset by a rebound in refining margins as domestic inventories tighten and West Coast capacity falls (EIA STEO Jan-2026).  
      – EIA expects gasoline prices to fall in every PADD in 2026, then rise again in all regions in 2027, with the West Coast showing the largest 2027 increase (EIA STEO Jan-2026).  
   •  Because the February 2026 edition is not yet posted, none of its “key points” can be summarized at this time.

Remaining information gaps
A. Full RBOB futures strip (all monthly contracts from the prompt month through April 2026).  
B. February 2026 STEO gasoline outlook (the report releases later today).  Access to the PDF or data browser after publication will be required.

Recommended follow-up searches (different from those already executed)
1. rbob futures settlement prices curve (Google) – should pull up CME or ICE pages that list daily settlements for each contract month.  
2. site:eia.gov february 2026 steo gasoline (Google) – once the report is live, this will locate the specific February publication for the gasoline section.

Until the two items above are obtained, the answer is necessarily partial.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
