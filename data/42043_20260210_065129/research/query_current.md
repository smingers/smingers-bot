Analysis:
To project the March 2026 U.S. retail gasoline average, the most useful near-term information will include:  
• The February 2026 EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) that contains monthly retail gasoline forecasts.  
• Current national average pump prices from AAA and the EIA weekly survey to anchor the February baseline.  
• RBOB gasoline futures for March/April 2026, which reflect market expectations for wholesale prices during the period when refiners switch to costlier summer blends.  
• News on crude oil supply (OPEC+ output policy, Middle-East/Russia disruptions), U.S. refinery maintenance/outages, and gasoline inventory levels, because these factors drive short-run price moves heading into spring.  
• Analyst commentary or bank research notes published in the last few days that explicitly mention March 2026 gasoline price outlooks.
