Analysis:
To generate an outside view, I want (1) a long history of the exact EIA series that will settle the question, (2) very recent news articles or analyses discussing the outlook for spring-2026 gasoline prices, and (3) a deeper synthesis of historical data, futures curves, and the latest EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) to anchor probabilistic estimates. The FRED database hosts a monthly version of the same EIA series, which is ideal for quickly calculating long-run means, medians, seasonality, and variance.
