The Commodity Weather Group projected above-average temperatures in the Midwest and South through February 20. Prices also declined due to negative carryover from Friday, when Baker Hughes reported that active U.S. natural gas drilling rigs rose to 130\u2014matching a 2.5-year high\u2014indicating higher near-term production. This follows a spike in prices to a 3-year high on January 28, caused by Arctic cold weather that disrupted production, froze gas wells, and increased heating demand, resulting in approximately 50 billion cubic feet (15% of total U.S. production) going offline. As of Monday, U.S. (lower-48) dry gas production was 113.4 bcf/day (+2.2% y/y), and demand was 104.0 bcf/day (+3.3% y/y). Estimated LNG net flows to U.S. export terminals were 19.2 bcf/day (+4.9% w/w). The EIA revised its 2026 U.S. dry gas production forecast downward to 107.4 bcf/day from 109.11 bcf/day. Despite near-record production levels, inventories remained tight: the EIA reported a record -360 bcf draw for the week ended January 30, above the 5-year average of -190 bcf, with inventories up +2.8% y/y and -1.1% below the 5-year seasonal average. European gas storage was 37% full as of February 7, compared to the 5-year seasonal average of 54%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 08:15 PM\nSource:[Barchart.com](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/113688/nat-gas-prices-tumble-as-us-weather-forecasts-warm)\n\n**BC-OILS**\nThe article presents futures trading data for key energy commodities on the New York Mercantile Exchange, including Light Sweet Crude Oil, Heating Oil, NY Harbor RBOB Gas, and Natural Gas.

This marks a 30.4-cent increase compared to a month ago and a 17.7-cent decrease from a year ago. The national average gasoline price rose 1.2 cents to $2.84 per gallon, up 5.4 cents from one month prior and 24.9 cents lower than the same period last year. Diesel prices rose 2.9 cents to $3.614 per gallon nationally. In Eugene, the price range spanned from $2.69/g (lowest) to $3.69/g (highest), a difference of 100.0 cents per gallon; statewide, prices ranged from $2.69/g to $4.19/g, a $1.50 difference. Historical data shows Eugene\u2019s average price was $3.31/g on February 9, 2024, and $3.53/g on February 9, 2025. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, attributed the recent rise to seasonal shifts, particularly California\u2019s transition to summer-grade gasoline, with West Coast states leading the increases. He noted that despite a slight drop in oil prices due to reduced geopolitical risk, seasonal pressures are expected to spread eastward, potentially pushing the national average above $3.00 per gallon for part of the spring.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 06:31 PM\nSource:[KVAL](https://kval.com/news/local/eugene-gas-prices-jump-169-cents-in-a-week-now-averaging-335-a-gallon)\n\n**NJ gas prices are creeping up again. How high will they go?**\nNew Jersey gas prices are expected to rise gradually, with forecasts predicting prices could reach just over $3.00 per gallon by late spring, according to GasBuddy.com data from early January. On February 9, 2026, prices ranged from $2.73 at a Wawa in Hackensack to $2.74 at a QuickChek on Route 17. AAA defines any price above $3.00 as a 'pain point,' and a poll estimates a 10 to 30 cent increase by late spring. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.com, attributes the rise to increasing spring demand and the upcoming switch to more expensive summer-blend gasoline, which typically occurs in April in the Northeast. He predicts prices may dip below $3.00 by July 4. Despite short-term increases, prices are expected to remain lower than in previous years due to slow demand, steady production, and ample inventories. Mark Schieldrop of AAA Northeast noted that cold weather has suppressed driving, contributing to lower demand. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects global oil production will exceed demand through 2027, with Brent crude expected to fall from $68 to $56 in 2026 and $54 in 2027. OPEC+ has paused production through March 2026, which could push prices up if extended. U.S. military involvement in Venezuela may eventually lower oil prices due to increased output, but De Haan cautions this effect won't be felt before 2026 due to infrastructure gaps. Meanwhile, concerns over Middle East instability and U.S.-Iran talks continue to influence global oil markets. The EIA forecasts daily oil production will rise by 1.4 million barrels in 2026 and an additional 500,000 in 2027.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 05:22 PM\nSource:[North Jersey](https://eu.northjersey.com/story/news/business/2026/02/09/nj-gas-prices-how-high-will-they-go-aaa-gas-prices/88589231007/)\n\n**Gas Prices Climb Again in Birmingham - Here's How They Compare Statewide and Nationally**\nGas prices in Birmingham rose 5.6 cents per gallon over the past week, reaching an average of $2.50, according to GasBuddy's survey of 550 stations in the metro area.

GasBuddy's dataset covers over 150,000 gas stations and is compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports. GasBuddy's '2026 Fuel Price Outlook' report forecasts that the U.S. annual average gasoline price will fall below $3.00 per gallon for the first time since the pandemic, with a predicted average of $2.97 per gallon in 2026\u201413 cents lower than the 2025 average of $3.10. The U.S. Department of Energy reports that the average unleaded gasoline price in 2020 was $2.17 per gallon. The American Automobile Association (AAA) reported last week's national average at $2.85 per gallon, up 6 cents from the previous week, down 5 cents from one month ago, and down 28 cents from the same time last year. AAA notes that this period typically sees the lowest gasoline demand, with demand expected to rise from late February to early March as temperatures warm. The top 10 most expensive U.S. markets for gasoline are: Hawaii ($4.41), California ($4.20), Washington State ($3.82), Alaska ($3.47), Nevada ($3.36), Oregon ($3.34), Washington D.C. ($3.09), Pennsylvania ($3.02), Vermont ($2.98), and Illinois ($2.98). The top 10 least expensive markets are: Oklahoma ($2.38), Arkansas ($2.42), Mississippi ($2.44), Kansas ($2.45), Texas ($2.45), Louisiana ($2.46), Tennessee ($2.48), Missouri ($2.48), Wisconsin ($2.51), and Alabama ($2.51). Despite a relatively stable U.S. economy, global growth is slowing, manufacturing remains weak, and structural shifts from energy transition are underway. Rising electric vehicle adoption and improved energy efficiency are flattening oil demand growth. This suggests that even with supply disruptions, oil prices are unlikely to surge significantly unless there is a large-scale, sustained supply shock. Thus, low oil prices are seen as a medium-term trend driven by demand-side structural changes. The Connecticut Association of Energy Marketers notes that increased domestic U.S. crude production is a key factor in keeping prices low. This domestic supply stability provides a crucial buffer against international geopolitical risks, reducing consumer exposure to global conflicts compared to past decades. The International Energy Agency (IEA) predicts global crude supply in 2026 will exceed demand by at least 3.8 million barrels per day, potentially the largest oversupply in history. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts a drop in Brent crude prices to $55 per barrel in the first quarter of 2026, with prices expected to remain at that low level throughout the year, and a projected annual supply surplus of 2.2 million barrels per day.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 12:09 AM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=a97d16fd-3fa3-4514-902f-1a074994e89a)\n\n**January Fuel Update: Will Prices Continue to Decrease?**\nAs of January 12, 2026, the national average gasoline price in the U.S. was $2.74 per gallon, down 17.0 cents from a month ago and 28.9 cents lower than the same time a year prior. This follows six consecutive weekly declines driven by seasonal trends, according to Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. The national average had fallen to $2.74 by January 5, 2026, down 21.2 cents from a month earlier and 29.2 cents from a year ago. Regional prices showed declines across all areas: East Coast ($2.74), Midwest ($2.60), Gulf Coast ($2.38), Rocky Mountain ($2.42), and West Coast ($3.65). Despite recent headlines about Venezuela\u2019s oil situation, De Haan stated that any impact on U.S. gasoline prices would likely take years to materialize, and for now, prices remain seasonally low. He noted that while some 'price-cycling' states saw temporary increases, most states experienced further declines. The 2026 projected fuel outlook anticipates a national average of $2.97, with prices expected to bottom out in the coming weeks before beginning a seasonal rise toward March. De Haan emphasized that even under optimistic scenarios, new oil supply from Venezuela would have limited near-term impact on U.S. pump prices.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 18, 2026 02:42 AM\nSource:[automotive-fleet.com](https://www.automotive-fleet.com/10252782/january-fuel-update-2026-projects-lowest-numbers-since-the-pandemic)\n\n**Gas Prices Hit 5-Year Low, Averaging $2.81 as Demand Drops**\nThe national average price for regular gasoline has dropped to $2.819 per gallon, the lowest level since March 2021, according to data from AAA and the Energy Information Administration (EIA). This decline follows a drop from $2.833 the prior week and $2.952 one month earlier, driven by stable crude oil supply and reduced demand, with U.S. gasoline demand falling from 8.56 million barrels per day to 8.17 million barrels per day. Crude oil prices remained stable, with WTI settling at $55.99 per barrel. The decrease in fuel costs presents opportunities for small businesses in transportation, logistics, and delivery services, potentially improving profit margins and enabling competitive pricing. However, the EIA notes shifting consumer habits, and industry analysts warn businesses to remain agile due to potential future volatility. Regional disparities are significant: Oklahoma averages $2.25 per gallon, while California reaches $4.23. Electric vehicle (EV) charging rates remain consistent at 38 cents per kilowatt-hour. AAA recommends using tools like the TripTik Travel planner to monitor fuel and charging prices. Despite current benefits, risks remain from geopolitical factors like Venezuela\u2019s oil output, which could trigger market instability, underscoring the need for flexible budgeting and strategic planning.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 16, 2026 03:11 PM\nSource:[Small Business Trends](https://smallbiztrends.com/gas-prices-hit-5-year-low-averaging-2-81-as-demand-drops/)\n\n**Gas Prices Hit 5-Year Low in U.S., Drivers to Save $11 Billion in 2026**\nIn early 2026, gasoline prices across the United States continued to decline, reaching their lowest levels since March 2021. According to AAA data, the national average gasoline price was $2.807 per gallon on January 9, 2026\u2014down 26 cents from the same period in 2025 and the lowest since 2021. California\u2019s average price was $4.224 per gallon, the lowest in a year, while 11 states had averages below $2.50, including Texas at $2.42 and Colorado at $2.401. GasBuddy reported even lower prices, with 0.6% of stations in the U.S. offering gasoline below $2.00 on January 8, and some stations in Colorado Springs selling it for as low as $1.73. Texas Governor Greg Abbott highlighted prices as low as $1.77 at Costco and Sam\u2019s Club. Analyst Patrick De Haan attributed the drop to increased global oil supply, particularly from Venezuela, despite political uncertainty. The U.S. Energy Department forecasted 2026 oil prices at $51 per barrel, down from $65 in 2025 and $77 in 2024. GasBuddy predicted a 2026 national average of $2.97, with prices peaking at $3.20 in summer before falling to $2.83 by December. This trend is expected to reduce total U.S. gasoline spending by $11 billion in 2026, with average household spending dropping to $2,083 from $2,144 in 2025 and $2,716 in 2022. The decline is projected to boost disposable income and consumer spending, according to Morgan Stanley research.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 10, 2026 03:36 AM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/26/1/10/n14672915.htm)\n\n**Gas Prices Hit Near 5-Year Low in U.S., Drivers to Save $11 Billion in 2026**\nAccording to The Epoch Times, U.S. gasoline prices reached their lowest levels in nearly five years at the start of 2026, with the national average falling to $2.807 per gallon\u2014down over 26 cents from the same period in 2025 and the lowest since March 2021.

This follows a trend that saw prices fall below $2.90 in December 2025 for the first time in four years. AAA attributes the decline to stable crude oil prices and strong global oil supply, with OPEC+ not planning production increases in the first quarter of 2026 due to lower demand. Prices were 25 cents lower than a year ago and 13 cents lower than a month prior. Oklahoma remains the cheapest state at $2.25 per gallon, the only state with an average under $2.35. Hawaii is the most expensive at $4.42 per gallon, nearly double Oklahoma\u2019s rate. GasBuddy.com projects the 2026 national average will be $2.97, 13 cents below 2025\u2019s $3.10 average. Patrick De Haan, Head of Petroleum Analysis at GasBuddy, stated that sustained declines are driven by tighter monetary policy, new refining capacity, and a shift from energy market chaos, adding that 'the wind is clearly behind drivers' backs' and that averages below $3 per gallon could become common in 2026 if no major disruptions occur.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 09, 2026 08:42 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/us/money/gas-prices-five-year-low-2026-b2897824.html)\n\n**Seasonal Factors Drive U.S. Retail Gas Prices to Near 5-Year Low**\nAccording to GasBuddy, the average U.S. retail gasoline price fell by 1.2 cents to $2.74 per gallon on January 5, 2026, down 21.2 cents from one month prior and 29.2 cents from the same period last year. This marks the sixth consecutive week of decline, driven primarily by seasonal factors. Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy\u2019s petroleum analyst, expects prices to bottom out in the coming weeks and begin rising again in March due to seasonal trends. GasBuddy\u2019s 2026 Fuel Price Outlook projects the national average gasoline price will fall below $3.00 per gallon for the first time since the pandemic, reaching $2.97 per gallon in 2026\u201413 cents lower than the 2025 average of $3.10. The report notes that while overall prices are declining, volatility may still occur due to seasonal demand, refinery maintenance, hurricane season, and ongoing geopolitical risks, such as recent U.S. military actions against Venezuela. However, De Haan emphasizes that Venezuela\u2019s current situation will not significantly impact U.S. gas prices in the short term, as improvements in output are slow and will not override the seasonal upward trend that typically begins in spring. Despite a relatively stable U.S. economy, global growth is slowing, manufacturing remains weak, and energy transition is driving structural shifts. Rising electric vehicle adoption and improved energy efficiency are flattening oil demand growth, limiting upward price pressure even during supply disruptions. Domestic U.S. crude production is a key factor suppressing prices, providing a buffer against international shocks. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts a global oil supply surplus of at least 3.8 million barrels per day in 2026\u2014the largest in history\u2014while the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts Brent crude could fall to $55 per barrel in Q1 2026 and remain low, with a projected surplus of 2.2 million barrels per day.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 06, 2026 11:23 PM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=fa5b90a5-0b27-42f8-9346-36a72507906e)\n\n**A jolly treat: Idahoans can enjoy lower gas prices, as average gallon of gas rings in under $3**\nFor the third consecutive week, the national average price of gasoline has declined, reaching its lowest level since March 12, 2021, according to Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy. The current national average is under $3 per gallon, resulting in weekly savings of nearly $400 million compared to the same period last year. Gas prices are lower in a majority of U.S. states, and the downward trend is expected to continue into late 2025, driven by refineries completing maintenance and increasing fuel output to near summer highs, along with additional oil production from OPEC that has pressured crude prices lower.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 15, 2025 10:27 PM\nSource:[KREM 2 Spokane](https://www.krem.com/article/traffic/gas-prices/gas-prices-lowest-price-since-start-of-covid-in-2021/277-bf2d7de9-d50f-49ee-9f0e-01eefd20f67d)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
