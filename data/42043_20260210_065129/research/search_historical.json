Historical monthly U.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices  \n   \u2022  The FRED series GASREGM (\u201cUS Regular All Formulations Gas Price, Dollars / Gallon, monthly end-of-period\u201d) provides the complete history back to September 1990.  \n      \u2013 Latest value (Jan-2026): $2.81 / gal, down 8.7 % year-on-year (FRED series GASREGM).  \n      \u2013 Selected recent values (end-of-period):  \n        \u2022 Apr-2025 $3.17  \u2022 Jul-2025 $3.12  \u2022 Oct-2025 $3.06  \u2022 Dec-2025 $2.89  \u2022 Jan-2026 $2.81 (FRED GASREGM).  \n      \u2013 Long-run statistics: all-time mean $2.26 / gal; historical minimum $0.92 / gal (Feb-1999); maximum $4.93 / gal (Jun-2022) (FRED GASREGM).  \n   \u2022  These data satisfy the \u201chistorical monthly price series\u201d part of the query.\n\n2. Current RBOB gasoline futures curve through April 2026  \n   \u2022  We have one point on the curve \u2013 the April 2026 NYMEX contract trading at $2.2024 / gal as of 1:41 a.m. EST (CNBC quote for @RB.2, expiring 31-Mar-2026).  \n   \u2022  However, no prices were returned for the intervening delivery months (Mar-2026, Feb-2026, \u2026, prompt months in 2025-2024).  The CME Group landing page that was captured only describes contract specs and does not list the strip (CME Group RBOB page).  Consequently the complete curve cannot yet be plotted or tabulated from the material at hand.\n\n3. Key points from the February 2026 EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) gasoline price outlook  \n   \u2022  The EIA has not yet released the February 2026 STEO \u2013 the agency website states \u201cNext release date  February 10 2026\u201d (EIA STEO petroleum products page, release dated 13-Jan-2026).  \n   \u2022  The most recent outlook available is the January 2026 STEO (released 13-Jan-2026).  Key gasoline take-aways from that report:  \n      \u2013 EIA projects average U.S. retail regular gasoline price at $2.92 / gal for 2026, down 6 % (-$0.18) from 2025\u2019s $3.10 / gal average (EIA STEO Jan-2026).  \n      \u2013 Prices edge up to $2.95 / gal in 2027 as crude prices firm slightly and West Coast refinery capacity tightens (EIA STEO Jan-2026).  \n      \u2013 2026 decline driven mainly by lower crude oil prices, partially offset by a rebound in refining margins as domestic inventories tighten and West Coast capacity falls (EIA STEO Jan-2026).  \n      \u2013 EIA expects gasoline prices to fall in every PADD in 2026, then rise again in all regions in 2027, with the West Coast showing the largest 2027 increase (EIA STEO Jan-2026).  \n   \u2022  Because the February 2026 edition is not yet posted, none of its \u201ckey points\u201d can be summarized at this time.\n\nRemaining information gaps\nA. Full RBOB futures strip (all monthly contracts from the prompt month through April 2026).  \nB. February 2026 STEO gasoline outlook (the report releases later today).  Access to the PDF or data browser after publication will be required.\n\nRecommended follow-up searches (different from those already executed)\n1. rbob futures settlement prices curve (Google) \u2013 should pull up CME or ICE pages that list daily settlements for each contract month.  \n2. site:eia.gov february 2026 steo gasoline (Google) \u2013 once the report is live, this will locate the specific February publication for the gasoline section.\n\nUntil the two items above are obtained, the answer is necessarily partial.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"GASREGM\" query=\"GASREGM\">\nFRED Economic Data: US Regular All Formulations Gas Price\nSeries ID: GASREGM\nUnits: Dollars per Gallon\nFrequency: Monthly, End of Period\nLatest observation: 2.81 (2026-01-01)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=3.08, min=2.81, max=3.17\n- 5-year: mean=3.38, min=2.50, max=4.93\n- 10-year: mean=2.90, min=1.76, max=4.93\n- All-time: mean=2.26, min=0.92, max=4.93 (since 1990-09-01)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: -0.08 (-2.9%)\n- 3-month change: -0.25 (-8.2%)\n- 6-month change: -0.32 (-10.1%)\n- Year-over-year: 2.81 vs 3.08 (-8.7%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Monthly, End of Period):\nDate,Value\n2025-02-01,3.12\n2025-03-01,3.10\n2025-04-01,3.17\n2025-05-01,3.15\n2025-06-01,3.15\n2025-07-01,3.12\n2025-08-01,3.13\n2025-09-01,3.17\n2025-10-01,3.06\n2025-11-01,3.05\n2025-12-01,2.89\n2026-01-01,2.81\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
