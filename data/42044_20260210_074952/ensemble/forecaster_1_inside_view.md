Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical Sources (Pre-Feb 10, 2026):**

1. **Reed Smith legal analysis (Dec 17, 2025)**: High-quality law firm source documenting multiple confirmed OSA penalties: £20,000 file-sharing fine (Dec 17), £1M+ AVS Group fines (Dec 4), £50,000 Itai Tech (Nov 20), £20,000 4chan (Oct 13). All with specific dates and amounts. **Factual record, not opinion.**

2. **Passle/Katten (Nov 20, 2025)**: Legal analysis confirming £50,000 4chan fine as "second confirmed financial penalty under OSA." Provides detailed enforcement timeline. **Factual with expert legal interpretation.**

3. **Engadget (Oct 14, 2025)**: Technology news reporting £20,000 4chan fine as "first fine under OSA." Quote from Tech Secretary Liz Kendall (identifiable expert). **Factual reporting with official statement.**

4. **The Register (Oct 13, 2025)**: Detailed reporting on £20,000 4chan fine plus daily penalties. Includes quote from Suzanne Cater (Ofcom Director of Enforcement - identifiable expert). **Factual with official source.**

5. **Lexology (Dec 12, 2025)**: Legal analysis of £1M AVS fine, described as "largest penalty to date under OSA." Discusses Ofcom's 2026 enforcement priorities. **Factual with forward-looking expert analysis.**

**Current/Future-Looking Sources:**

6. **The Big Issue (Feb 10, 2026)**: Opinion piece on online safety for women. Notes Ofcom guidance is "voluntary" and enforcement "relies heavily on platform cooperation." **Opinion-heavy, limited factual enforcement data.**

7. **Mirror (Jan 8, 2026)**: Reports Ofcom advancing investigation into pro-suicide forum, working toward "provisional decision" with potential fines up to £18M or 10% revenue. Final decision expected "by end of first quarter 2026" (i.e., by March 31). **Factual reporting on ongoing investigation.**

8. **Yahoo/BBC (Nov 25, 2025)**: Reports Ofcom issued "only two fines under OSA since 2023 implementation." Notes 4chan refusing to pay £20,000. **Factual but appears to undercount penalties compared to Reed Smith source.**

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE:**
- **Multiple confirmed penalties published Oct-Dec 2025**: Reed Smith documents at least 4 separate enforcement decisions with monetary penalties totaling ~£1.1M+ (4chan £20k, 4chan £50k, AVS £1.05M, file-sharing £20k, Itai Tech £50k). Multiple independent legal sources confirm this pattern.
- **Established enforcement cadence**: 3-5 penalties over 3 months (Oct-Dec 2025) = ~1-1.7 penalties/month during active phase.
- **Official forward guidance**: Mirror article (Jan 2026) reports specific ongoing investigation with provisional decision expected "by end of Q1 2026" (March 31) - this falls within the Feb 10-May 1 window.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**
- **Investigation pipeline**: Reed Smith notes "92 services" under investigation as of Dec 4, 2025, with "three providers fined." Large pipeline suggests multiple opportunities for additional penalties.
- **Regulatory momentum**: Lexology reports Ofcom's 2026 priorities include enforcement focus on top 100 adult sites and major platforms (Meta, TikTok, etc.).
- **Institutional commitment**: Multiple quotes from Tech Secretary Kendall and Ofcom officials emphasizing enforcement intent.

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**
- **"Further fines imminent" statement**: While suggestive, lacks specific timeline.
- **Voluntary guidance concerns**: Big Issue article notes some measures remain voluntary, but this doesn't prevent mandatory enforcement actions.

**CRITICAL FACT**: The Mirror article (Jan 8, 2026) specifically states a provisional decision on a major investigation is expected "by end of first quarter 2026" (March 31). This is a concrete, dated expectation that falls squarely within the Feb 10-May 1 resolution window.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: February 10 - May 1, 2026 = 80 days (2.7 months)

**Historical rate**: ~1-1.7 penalties published per month during Oct-Dec 2025 active enforcement phase.

**If timeframe halved (40 days/1.35 months)**: Probability would decrease to ~75-80%, as shorter window reduces opportunities for publication, though Mirror article's Q1 2026 expectation would still likely fall within window.

**If timeframe doubled (160 days/5.4 months)**: Probability would increase to ~95-97%, as longer window provides multiple opportunities and would capture any Q2 2026 penalties.

**Key temporal factor**: Mirror article's "end of Q1 2026" (March 31) provisional decision expectation is highly relevant - this is 49 days into the 80-day resolution window.

## (d) Justification

**Base rate from outside view**: 87% (based on 1 penalty/month rate over 2.7 months)

**Factors supporting upward adjustment:**
1. **Specific dated expectation**: Mirror article reports provisional decision expected by March 31, 2026 - this is not speculative but based on Ofcom's stated timeline for an active investigation. This is within the resolution window.
2. **Confirmed enforcement pattern**: Multiple independent sources document sustained enforcement activity (4-5 penalties over 3 months).
3. **Large investigation pipeline**: 92 services under investigation provides multiple pathways to publication.
4. **Question only requires ONE penalty**: Not asking about multiple penalties or specific targets.

**Factors supporting downward adjustment:**
1. **Provisional vs. final decisions**: Mirror article mentions "provisional decision" - there may be additional time before final confirmation decision is published.
2. **Legal challenges**: 4chan lawsuit and potential other challenges could slow some actions.
3. **Seasonal effects**: Jan-Feb often slower for regulatory activity.

**Calibration reasoning**: The Mirror article's specific timeline (provisional decision by March 31) is strong evidence that at least one enforcement action will reach publication stage within the window. However, "provisional decision" may not constitute final "published enforcement decision" per resolution criteria. Reed Smith source shows some cases had both provisional and confirmation decisions published separately.

The historical pattern of 1-1.7 penalties/month over 2.7 months, combined with specific forward guidance about Q1 2026 decision, supports high confidence. However, uncertainty about whether provisional decisions count, and potential for delays, warrants slight downward adjustment from outside view.

**Inside view calibration**: 85%

This represents slight downward adjustment from 87% outside view, accounting for:
- Uncertainty about provisional vs. final decision publication timing
- Potential for delays in specific cases
- Conservative approach given legal/political pressures mentioned in sources

However, confidence remains high because:
- Only need ONE publication over 2.7 months
- Specific Q1 2026 decision timeline reported
- Established enforcement pattern with large pipeline
- Multiple independent pathways to resolution

Probability calibration:

Starting from 87% outside view base rate, I adjust to 85% inside view based on:
- (+) Strong evidence of specific Q1 2026 provisional decision expected (Mirror, Jan 2026)
- (+) Large investigation pipeline (92 services) provides multiple opportunities
- (+) Established 1-1.7 penalty/month publication rate
- (-) Uncertainty whether "provisional" decisions count as published enforcement decisions
- (-) Potential delays from legal challenges and seasonal factors
- (=) Question requires only ONE publication over 2.7 months, which is highly achievable

The 85% probability reflects high confidence while acknowledging realistic uncertainties about timing and publication procedures.

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Ofcom publish at least one OSA enforcement decision stating a monetary penalty amount between Feb 10 and May 1, 2026? ✓

2. **Base rate**: Outside view established 87% based on 1 penalty/month historical rate over 2.7 months. Final prediction (85%) remains anchored to this base rate with minor adjustment for procedural uncertainties. ✓

3. **Consistency check**: "85 out of 100 times, Ofcom publishes at least one enforcement decision with a stated monetary penalty between Feb 10 and May 1, 2026." This aligns with established enforcement pattern (1-1.7/month), large investigation pipeline, and specific Q1 2026 decision timeline. ✓

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - Mirror (Jan 2026): Provisional decision expected by March 31, 2026 on major investigation ✓
   - Reed Smith (Dec 2025): 4-5 penalties published Oct-Dec 2025, establishing ~1.5/month rate ✓
   - Reed Smith (Dec 2025): 92 services under investigation as of Dec 4, 2025 ✓

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: All ongoing investigations face unexpected delays due to legal challenges (4chan lawsuit precedent) or political pressure, AND provisional decisions don't count as "published enforcement decisions" per resolution criteria, AND Q1 2026 timeline slips to Q2. This could drop probability to ~60-65%.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Status quo is continued enforcement activity at established pace. Given low volatility in regulatory processes and 2.7-month window, slight nudge toward status quo is appropriate. Current 85% already reflects this conservative positioning relative to 87% base rate.

Probability: 85%
