Analysis:
1. Source analysis  
• Passle (20 Nov 2025), JD Supra (12 Dec 2025), Engadget/The Register (Oct 2025) – all describe monetary-penalty decisions that Ofcom published in 2025.  High-quality secondary sources, but those decisions precede the question-opening date so are useful only for establishing base rates.  
• The Mirror (8 Jan 2026) – quotes an Ofcom notice that it is “working toward a provisional decision” on a pro-suicide forum and that “a final decision is expected by the end of Q1 2026.”  Single, named mainstream UK source; moderate–strong relevance.  
• 20 Minutos (8 Feb 2026) – reports a formal Ofcom investigation into X for non-consensual sexual images; no timetable for decision.  Recent, but only indicates pipeline.  Weak evidence for a decision before May 1.  
• Other AskNews items (Big Issue, JD Supra on OFSI etc.) concern adjacent policy areas, not Ofcom OSA enforcement; low relevance.

2. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Historical pattern: Between Oct 2025 – Dec 2025 Ofcom published at least four OSA decisions with stated fines (4chan, Im.ge, AVS, file-sharing service).  Shows capability and willingness; structural factor hard to change.  
Moderate evidence  
• Mirror (Jan 2026): final decision on suicide forum “expected by end Q1 2026”; would likely carry a financial penalty if breaches confirmed.  
• Ofcom press statements (late 2025) that it will “prioritise enforcement in 2026” and has 90+ open investigations.  
Weak evidence  
• Fresh investigation into X (Feb 2026) – decision timing unknown; could slip past May 1.  
• Political pressure / “name and shame” rhetoric – may or may not accelerate publications.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Window left: ~80 days (10 Feb – 1 May 2026).  If the rate of published monetary-penalty decisions averages 0.5–1.0 per month (observed late 2025), expected count in 80 days = 1–2.  Halving the window to 40 days would drop P(≥1) ~20 pp; doubling to 160 days would raise P(≥1) ~15 pp.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (late-2025 cadence) → 78 %.  
Inside-view upward nudges:  
• Concrete case whose own timetable (“end Q1 2026”) falls within window (+7 pp).  
• Ofcom has already drafted several provisional decisions that normally convert to published fines within 2–3 months (+3 pp).  
Downward nudges:  
• Publication slippage risk (Easter recess, legal appeals, need for Ofcom Board sign-off) (–6 pp).  
• Small sample / burstiness makes Poisson assumption optimistic (–3 pp).

Net inside-view probability ≈ 79 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that in 79 out of 100 similar 80-day windows, Ofcom would publish at least one Online Safety Act enforcement decision that specifies a fine.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Between 10 Feb 2026 and 1 May 2026, will Ofcom publicly post an Online Safety Act enforcement decision stating a monetary penalty?  
2. Outside-view base rate used: 78 %.  
3. Consistency line: “79 out of 100 times, a qualifying decision is published.”  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
   – Four OSA fine decisions published Oct–Dec 2025 (~1/month).  
   – Ofcom notice: suicide forum final decision due by end Q1 2026.  
   – 90+ open investigations; Ofcom pledges “priority enforcement in 2026.”  
   – No fines yet in 2026, so timing slippage is possible.  
5. Blind-spot: unforeseen legal injunction or judicial review freezes all OSA publications until after May 1.  
6. Status-quo: continuing cadence of ~monthly fine publications supports “Yes.”

Probability: 79%
