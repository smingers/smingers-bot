Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Guardian, 4-Dec-2025 – Hard-news report, lists a £1 m + £50 k fine on AVS Group. Very reliable mainstream source; facts are drawn from Ofcom’s own publication.  
2. GOV.UK explainer, undated but maintained 2024-25 – Primary government source explaining powers; contains no enforcement outcomes, only background. High factual reliability, but of limited relevance to frequencies.  
3. Passle blog, 20-Nov-2025 – Legal-practice note on the 4chan decision (£50 k fine). Cites and links to the Ofcom “Confirmation Decision”. Reasonably reliable because it is based on the primary document, though it is a secondary commentary site.  
4. Engadget, 14-Oct-2025 – Tech-news article on the first 4chan fine (£20 k + £100/day). Reasonably reliable; cross-checks with Ofcom press release.  
5. Passle blog, 11-Dec-2025 – Legal commentary on the AVS £1 m fine. Same assessment as (3).  
6. Techbuzz.ai, undated 2025 – Lesser-known tech site repeating the 4chan fine. Lower editorial standards; adds speculation. Treat as low-quality except for facts that match Ofcom release.  
7. Agent report (compilation up to Feb-2026) – Collates every known Ofcom enforcement since 2020 with legal basis, amount and date; also quotes Ofcom policy statements. Provides useful structured chronology but is itself a derivative summary so could contain omissions. Cross-checks with items 1-5 show no obvious errors; treat as medium reliability for counts and timing, low for forward-looking commentary.

All factual claims used below appear in at least one high-quality primary or well-corroborated secondary source. Opinions are ignored except when explicitly attributed to Ofcom officials.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Potential reference classes:  
1. Ofcom enforcement decisions under the Online Safety Act (OSA) since the Act’s powers became live (Jan-2024). Count: 3 monetary decisions (4chan Oct-25, 4chan Nov-25, AVS Dec-25) over ~4.0 months.  
2. All Ofcom digital-safety monetary sanctions (OSA + Video-Sharing-Platform regime) since 2020. Count: 6 decisions over ~49 months ⇒ 0.12 per month.  
3. First-year enforcement of other UK regulators given new sanction powers (e.g., ICO under GDPR in 2018: 4 monetary penalties within first 9 months ⇒ 0.44 per month).  

Reference class 1 is the closest match (same regulator, same statute, same sanction type). It uses an immediate run-rate of 0.75 monetary decisions per month. Class 2 blends in a period before the Act existed and understates today’s tempo; class 3 involves different regulators and regimes. I therefore adopt Reference class 1.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days remaining until 1-May-2026 resolution: 80 days (≈ 2.6 months).  
If the 0.75-per-month base-rate persisted, expected number λ ≈ 0.75 × 2.6 ≈ 2.0 monetary decisions between now and the deadline.

Under a Poisson assumption, P(≥1 decision) = 1 − e^(−λ) = 1 − e^(−2.0) ≈ 0.865.  

Historical pattern: three fines arrived in close succession once the first OSA codes became enforceable (March-2025). No fine has been published in the last ~9 weeks (since 11-Dec-2025), but Ofcom statements in those December publications said “further fines are imminent” and “investigations into 20 more services” are live. That lull is short relative to sample size and does not yet signal a slowdown.

(d) Justification for outside view  
• The phase-in of OSA duties is still underway; Part 5 (pornography) is already fully live and has generated two monetary penalties. Illegal-content duties for all user-to-user services entered force in March-2025 and Ofcom opened >90 investigations. Therefore the universe of potential targets is expanding, not contracting.  
• Ofcom’s policy papers stress deterrence and progressive escalation: first information requests, then daily default penalties, then final monetary sanctions. The pipeline suggests a continuing stream of cases reaching the “decision” stage.  
• Legal challenges (e.g., 4chan in US court) could delay some cases, but Ofcom has demonstrated willingness to proceed and publish despite litigation.  
• A complete absence of further decisions for 2½ months would be historically unprecedented since fines began (0 decisions over 2.5 months vs 3 over previous 2). That would require either (i) every current investigation settling without a published penalty, or (ii) Ofcom choosing to hold decisions until after 1-May. Both scenarios seem possible but collectively unlikely.  
• Upset frequency: regulators occasionally pause enforcement during election purdah or when guidance is under legal review. The UK has no scheduled general election before 1-May-2026, and the Act has withstood initial judicial scrutiny. I assign a ~15 % chance that no additional monetary decision is published in the narrow window because of administrative delay, litigation, or strategic clustering of announcements.

Outside view calibration:
Base Poisson-derived probability: 86.5 %.  
Down-adjust 4 pp for possibility of an administrative “quiet period” or bunching just after 1-May-2026.  
Down-adjust a further 4 pp for model uncertainty (small sample size, potential over-dispersion).  

Outside View Prediction:
78.5 %
