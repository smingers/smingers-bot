Analysis:
1. Source analysis
   a. Lexology 12-Dec-2025: legal briefing; cites Ofcom £1 m AVS fine and states enforcement will be “prioritised in 2026”.  High credibility (law-firm, dated, links to Ofcom documents).  Factual.
   b. Mirror 08-Jan-2026: mainstream UK newspaper; quotes Ofcom notice that final decision on suicide forum is expected “by end Q1 2026” and sets out potential fines.  Moderate/high quality; mixes facts (Ofcom timeline, court sentence) with opinion from bereaved families.
   c. 20 Minutos 08-Feb-2026: Spanish paper; reports Ofcom has opened investigation into X over deep-fake CSAM.  Recent, factual but only at investigation stage.  Moderate reliability.
   d. JD Supra 20-Nov- & 04-Dec-2025 plus Passle 20-Nov-2025: law-firm analyses describing three separate fines already published (£20 k, £50 k, £1 m).  High credibility; reinforce Ofcom’s track-record.
   e. Register 13-Oct- & 25-Nov-2025: tech news; first fine and criticism of Ofcom leniency.  Good factual record, moderate reliability.
   f. Big Issue 10-Feb-2026 and other non-UK items: commentary on online harms; tangential, little bearing on fines.

2. Evidence analysis
   Strong evidence (shifts +):
     • Ofcom has already published three monetary penalties within 50 days in late-2025, documented by multiple independent legal and news sources.
     • Ofcom notice (Mirror) explicitly signals a further decision targeted for before 31-Mar-2026.
     • Structural factor: regulator empowered to impose fines of up to 10 % global revenue and has publicly budgeted £92 m for on-line-safety work in FY 25/26.
   Moderate evidence (+):
     • Ofcom states 20+ additional services under investigation; 92 opened since March 2025.
     • 2026 enforcement priority flagged in several legal briefings.
   Weak / counter evidence (−):
     • No fines published in the 68 days since 04-Dec-2025 (possible bottleneck).
     • Ongoing litigation by 4chan shows decisions can be delayed or contested.

3. Timeframe analysis
   • 81 days remain until 01-May-2026.
   • If window were halved (≈40 days) I would lower probability to ~63 % (less time for a decision to mature).
   • If doubled to 160 days I would raise it to ~87 % (ample time for pipeline cases).

4. Justification / inside-view shift
   Outside-view base rate (from Poisson extrapolation of recent OSA cadence) = 71 %.
   Adjustments:
     +8 pp  Mirror article gives explicit timetable for a Q1 decision.
     +4 pp  Multiple statements that 2026 enforcement is a priority, many live cases.
     –5 pp  Two-month lull and litigation/appeal risk could push decisions past May.
   Net inside-view ≈ 78 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that 78 times out of 100, at least one new Ofcom enforcement decision with a stated fine will be published between now (10 Feb 2026) and 1 May 2026.”

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Between 10 Feb – 1 May 2026 will Ofcom publish an Online Safety Act enforcement decision that names a monetary penalty?  
2. Base rate used: 71 %.  
3. Consistency line above.  
4. Key evidence: (i) Three fines already published; (ii) Ofcom Q1 deadline on suicide forum; (iii) 20+ open investigations; (iv) two-month lull; (v) litigation risk.  
5. Blind-spot: Government pause/order for strategic review stalls all new decisions until post-May; would drop probability <30 %.  
6. Status-quo: No new fines since Dec; nudged estimate 5 pp downward to account for inertia.

Probability: 78%
