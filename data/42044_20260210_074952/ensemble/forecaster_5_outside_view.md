Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  

1. Guardian, 4 Dec 2025 – Factual news report; quotes Ofcom, gives hard numbers (£1 m + £50 k).  Reputable national paper, high credibility.  
2. GOV.UK “Online Safety Act explainer” – Primary government source, policy not enforcement; high credibility, no monetary-penalty data.  
3. Passle post, 20 Nov 2025 – Law-firm commentary on 4chan decision; reproduces figures from Ofcom confirmation decision (£50 k).  Credible as secondary legal analysis; minor risk of error.  
4. Engadget, 14 Oct 2025 – Tech-news site; reports first 4chan fine (£20 k + £100/day).  Generally reliable for straightforward news, moderate credibility.  
5. Passle post, 11 Dec 2025 – Law-firm review of AVS £1 m fine; again based on Ofcom publication, good credibility.  
6. Techbuzz.ai item, undated but c. Oct 2025 – Small tech blog repeating 4chan story; lower editorial standards, adds speculation; use for cross-check only.  
7. Agent report (compiled Feb 2026) – Synthetic but cites primary Ofcom documents and mainstream/legal commentary; useful consolidation but treat with caution.

Across these sources the only hard facts we need are:  
• Three monetary penalties under the Online Safety Act have already been published:  
  – 14 Oct 2025  4chan £20 k (+ daily)  
  – 20 Nov 2025  4chan £50 k (confirmation decision)  
  – 04 Dec 2025  AVS Group £1 m (+£50 k)

All appeared on Ofcom’s Enforcement page, so they would have resolved the forecasting question—had it already been open.

(b) Reference-class analysis  

Possible classes:  
1. All Ofcom monetary-penalty decisions under any statute (Communications Act, Broadcasting, VSP, OSA) since 2010.  Pros: large N.  Cons: includes mature regimes with slower cadence; may under-state frequency in the current startup phase.  
2. Monetary-penalty decisions under new regulatory regimes during their first two years (e.g., Ofcom VSP regime 2020-22, ICO GDPR 2018-19, CMA “Senior Accounting Officer” 2010-11).  Pros: captures early-stage enforcement burst.  Cons: cross-agency heterogeneity.  
3. The Online Safety Act monetary-penalty decisions to date (Oct–Dec 2025).  Pros: exact match of legal framework.  Cons: only three data points; risk of over-fitting a short spike.

Suitability: Class 3 is legally identical and temporally closest; we therefore take it as the baseline but sanity-check with Class 1 (long-run Ofcom average).

(c) Timeframe analysis  

Time until resolution: 1 May 2026 − 10 Feb 2026 = 81 days (~11.5 weeks).  

Observed pattern:  
• 3 OSA fines were published in the 52 days 14 Oct–4 Dec 2025 (0.058/day).  
• Zero additional fines have been published in the 68 days 4 Dec 2025–10 Feb 2026 (0/day).  
Thus, in the last 120 days the rate is 3/120 ≈ 0.025/day.  

For mature Ofcom regimes (Communications Act broadcasting fines) the long-run average is ~4–6 monetary decisions per year, or 0.012/day.  

(d) Justification  

• Regulatory phase: The Act’s codes became enforceable only in March 2025; Ofcom stated in December that the AVS penalty was a “warning shot” and that 20+ further investigations were open.  Early enforcement phases of other regimes (e.g., VSP 2024-25, ICO GDPR 2018-19) show clustering of initial fines followed by further but less frenetic activity.  
• Pipeline: Official statements (Guardian, Passle, Ofcom quotes) indicate numerous live investigations, several already escalated.  Hence at least one decision is likely to mature within the next quarter.  
• Capacity constraint: Ofcom online-safety budget for 2025/26 is £92 m (Agent report), suggesting resources to publish further decisions.  
• Event dispersion risk: Litigation (4chan in US courts) could delay some cases, and Ofcom may bunch publications for strategic effect (e.g., before parliamentary hearings).  There is a non-trivial chance that no case lands exactly within the narrow 81-day window.

Outside view calibration:

Baseline using recent OSA rate (3 fines /119 days): expected λ = 0.025 × 81 ≈ 2.0 fines.  Poisson P(at least 1) = 1 − e^(−2.0) ≈ 86.5 %.  

Adjustments:  
– Regression to longer-run Ofcom monetary-decision rate (0.012/day) would give P ≈ 62 %.  (Down-15 pp)  
– Early-regime enforcement tends to overshoot long-run average (+5 pp).  
– Pipeline signals (20+ cases under way) (+5 pp).  
– Short window timing/ litigation risk (−10 pp).

Net outside-view probability ≈ 86.5 % − 15 % + 5 % + 5 % − 10 % ≈ 71 %.

Historical “upset” rate: across regulatory forecasts a surprise non-event occurs perhaps 25 % of the time in windows <3 months.  Keeping us a little conservative.

Outside View Prediction: 71 %.
