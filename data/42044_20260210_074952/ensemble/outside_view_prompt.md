You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will Ofcom publish at least one enforcement decision under the UK Online Safety Act that includes a monetary penalty amount?

Question background:
Early monetary penalties under the Online Safety framework would signal enforcement intensity and compliance risk for platforms operating in the UK.

`{"format":"bot_tournament_question","info":{"hash_id":"61d27607dc980762","sheet_id":178.1}}`

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves “Yes” if, after the time the question opens and before May 1, 2026, Ofcom publishes a public enforcement outcome under the Online Safety Act (or explicitly under Online Safety enforcement) that states a monetary penalty amount (a fine), and “No” otherwise. The primary source is Ofcom’s Enforcement page, which can be filtered to Online safety: https://www.ofcom.org.uk/enforcement. A qualifying publication must explicitly state that a monetary penalty/financial penalty/fine has been imposed and must specify an amount.

**Source:** The Guardian  
**Date:** December 04, 2025  
**Author:** Dan Milmo

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Monetary Penalty Details:**
   - AVS Group (Belize-based company running 18 adult websites) fined £1 million by Ofcom for inadequate age verification checks

   - This is the third time Ofcom has fined a company in relation to the Online Safety Act
   - Strict age-checking requirements came into force in July (2025)
   - AVS has 72 hours to introduce effective age checks or face £1,000/day penalty
   - Additional £300 daily penalty until information requests are answered (maximum 60 days)

3. **Broader Enforcement Activity:**
   - Ofcom has opened investigations into 92 online services since new rules were introduced
   - 83 pornography sites currently under investigation
   - One unnamed major social media company may face formal action for inadequate risk assessments
   - Ofcom is reviewing an unnamed major platform's systems for removing illegal terror and hate content

4. **Compliance Progress:**

   - Social media platforms including X, TikTok, and Reddit have also implemented age checks

5. **VPN Usage:**
   - VPN usage surged from 600,000 to over 1 million when age checks came in
   - Now "significantly" under 1 million users

6. **Potential Penalties Under the Act:**
   - Breaches can carry fines of £18 million or 10% of annual revenue, or being shut down in the UK

## Named Source Opinions:

- **Oliver Griffiths (Group Director of Online Safety at Ofcom):** Described the fine as part of a "broader tide turning" in cleaning up platforms; stated further fines are imminent; noted research suggests children aren't the main drivers of increased VPN usage

- **Liz Kendall (Technology Secretary):** Stated platforms have "finally started taking responsibility" since enforcement began; confirmed government's full backing for Ofcom's enforcement powers; called keeping children safe online a government and personal priority

# Summary of "Online Safety Act: explainer" from GOV.UK

## Key Facts and Information Relevant to the Question:

**Ofcom's Enforcement Powers:**
- Ofcom is the independent regulator of Online Safety
- Ofcom has "a broad range of powers to assess and enforce providers' compliance with the framework"
- The article does not specify what these enforcement powers include or whether they encompass monetary penalties

**Implementation Timeline:**
- The Act is being implemented in phases
- Criminal offences came into effect on 31 January 2024
- Category thresholds (Category 1, 2A, and 2B) were laid via secondary legislation on 16 December 2024

- Ofcom must develop guidance and codes of practice through public consultation before they take effect

**Enforcement Approach:**
- In September 2024, following a letter from the Secretary of State, Ofcom established a "dedicated small but risky supervision taskforce to monitor such services, and move to rapid enforcement where there is evidence of non-compliance"

**Scope of Duties:**
- Duties apply to services allowing users to post content or interact online
- Providers must implement systems to reduce illegal activity risks and remove illegal content
- Platforms must protect children from harmful content
- Category 1 services have additional requirements for adult user protections

## Notable Limitations:
The article does not mention:
- Specific monetary penalty amounts or fine structures
- Whether Ofcom's enforcement powers include the ability to impose fines
- Any enforcement decisions that have been published to date
- Details about the enforcement process or penalty framework

This is a general explainer document about the Act's provisions rather than information about enforcement outcomes or penalty mechanisms.

# Summary of Article: "Lessons Learnt from Ofcom's First Enforcement of the Online Safety Act - Lessons from 4chan"

**Source:** Passle  
**Date:** November 20, 2025  
**Authors:** Terry Green, Larry Wong, Amélie Hitchings

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Monetary Penalty Amount:** A £50,000 fine was imposed by Ofcom, described as "the second confirmed financial penalty under the OSA" (Online Safety Act).

2. **Investigation Scope:** Ofcom announced an investigation into 20 more services on November 20 (2025).

3. **Timeline of Ofcom's Engagement with 4chan:**
   - March 27, 2025 and April 8, 2025: Ofcom reached out to 4chan offering introductory meetings
   - June 10, 2025: Ofcom's investigation officially began
   - 4chan did not respond to Ofcom's offers

4. **UK User Threshold:** The article reveals that 4chan having 7% of its users from the UK was considered "significant" by Ofcom, particularly as this represented the second largest demographic for 4chan.

5. **Enforcement Focus:** The Confirmation Decision focused on 4chan's failure to provide information to Ofcom on:
   - 4chan's illegal content risk assessment
   - 4chan's qualifying worldwide revenue

## Key Points Relevant to the Forecasting Question:

- This £50,000 fine is explicitly identified as "the second confirmed financial penalty under the OSA"
- The article references a "Confirmation Decision" published by Ofcom that details the enforcement action
- Ofcom has a clearly defined escalation procedure before issuing enforcement actions
- The article indicates Ofcom is actively pursuing enforcement with financial penalties

## Additional Context:

- **Extra-territorial Application:** Ofcom rejected 4chan's claims that it lacks jurisdiction over a US company, dedicating over a page in the Confirmation Decision to this issue
- **Aggravating Factors:** Ofcom cited 4chan's lack of cooperation as an aggravating factor that increased the financial penalty
- **Geo-blocking:** Some sites have attempted to restrict UK user access, but Ofcom continues investigations if sites remain accessible through mirrored domains or other methods
- **US Legal Challenge:** There is ongoing litigation between 4chan and Ofcom in the US District Court for the District of Columbia

# Summary of Article: UK regulator fines 4chan for ignoring Online Safety Act demands

**Source:** Engadget  
**Date:** October 14, 2025

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Monetary Penalty:** Ofcom has fined 4chan £20,000 ($26,700) for failing to comply with information requests under the UK's Online Safety Act of 2023.

2. **Additional Daily Penalty:** Ofcom is imposing an additional penalty of £100 ($133) per day on 4chan until it complies with the regulator's requests for information.

3. **First Fine Under the Act:** This is the first fine Ofcom has handed down under the Online Safety Act.

4. **Timeline:** Ofcom's first online safety codes became enforceable in March 2025. The investigation into 4chan was launched in June 2025.

5. **Non-Compliance Details:** 4chan ignored Ofcom's requests for:
   - A copy of its illegal harms risk assessment
   - Information about its qualifying worldwide revenue

6. **Legal Challenge:** In August 2025, 4chan filed a lawsuit against Ofcom, arguing that enforcement of the UK's Online Safety Act violates Americans' freedom of speech.

## Named Source Opinions:

- **Liz Kendall, UK Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology:** "This fine is a clear warning to those who fail to remove illegal content or protect children from harmful material."

## Additional Context:

- Ofcom released updates for 11 investigations it opened after the codes became enforceable
- The regulator received complaints about illegal content on 4chan
- Other enforcement outcomes mentioned: Two file-sharing services deployed automated CSAM detection tools after Ofcom found "serious compliance concerns"; four other file-sharing services chose to geoblock UK IP addresses

# Summary of Article: "Lessons in online safety: Ofcom's £1 million fine against AVS and end of year review"

**Source:** Passle  
**Date:** December 11, 2025  
**Authors:** Jack Higgins, Bryony Bacon

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Monetary Penalty Imposed:** Ofcom published a £1 million fine against AVS Limited (AVS), an adult website provider, for age assurance failings under the Online Safety Act (OSA).

2. **Additional Fine:** AVS was also fined an additional £50,000 for failure to respond to Ofcom's request for information (RFI).

3. **Risk Assessment Data:** During 2025, Ofcom requested and received 104 risk assessments from in-scope providers, with 11 providers subsequently asked to revisit their assessments.

4. **Risk Assessment Deficiencies:** 69 of the 104 risk assessments reviewed by Ofcom did not name the person responsible for the assessment, which Ofcom guidance indicates is necessary to fulfill record keeping duties under the OSA regime.

5. **Adult Site Compliance:** The top 10 most popular adult sites have adopted 'highly effective age assurance' following the July 25 deadline. Ofcom plans to focus on the top 100 UK adult sites in 2026.

## Key Context:

- The AVS fine is described as "Ofcom's most significant fine to date" and represents enforcement action under the Online Safety Act regime.
- AVS's age verification approach (involving upload of an adult's photo) was found to be too vulnerable to circumvention by children and therefore not 'highly effective.'
- Ofcom released two additional papers alongside the fine announcement: a Sector Response Report and a Risk Assessment Report analyzing the impact of the OSA regime.

## Ofcom's 2026 Priorities (as stated in the article):

- Monitoring compliance with age assurance requirements among top 100 UK adult sites
- Issuing RFIs to Meta, TikTok, Pinterest, and YouTube regarding child safety measures
- Expecting "meaningful, measurable improvements" from providers
- Taking enforcement action where necessary improvements have not been made

## Commentary/Analysis (from article authors):

The authors note that these publications and the AVS fine represent "a warning shot to industry" and demonstrate that "online safety enforcement in the UK is getting off the ground." They acknowledge that Ofcom has been criticized for a cautious approach but suggest these latest actions signal increased enforcement activity ahead.

# Summary of Article: "UK hits 4Chan with £20K fine, daily penalties for OSA defiance"

**Key Facts and Statistics:**

- Ofcom has imposed a £20,000 fine on 4Chan under the Online Safety Act (OSA)
- Additional daily penalties of £100 per day starting "tomorrow" (from article publication date), which could accumulate to another £6,000
- Total potential penalty mentioned: £26,000
- Maximum penalty allowed under the OSA: £18 million (approximately 700 times the current imposed fine)
- Ofcom launched its OSA investigation into 4Chan in June (year not specified, but context suggests 2024 or 2025)
- 4Chan filed a federal lawsuit against the UK government in August

**Named Source Opinions:**

- Suzanne Cater, Ofcom's enforcement director: "Today sends a clear message that any service which flagrantly fails to engage with Ofcom and their duties under the Online Safety Act can expect to face robust enforcement action"

**Context and Background:**

- The fines are described as "mid-investigation fines" rather than final penalties
- The penalties stem from 4Chan's failure to respond to legally-binding information requests about global revenue and illegal content risk assessments
- 4Chan's legal strategy involves arguing that Ofcom is overreaching by applying British law to American companies
- The investigation was triggered by complaints about "potential for illegal content and activity" on the platform

**Unnamed/Less Reliable Source Claims:**

- "Industry sources suggest this enforcement action is just the opening move in what could become a prolonged regulatory chess match" (no specific source named)
- The article contains significant editorial analysis and speculation about broader implications, platform strategies, and comparisons to EU's Digital Services Act approach

Query: List all Ofcom enforcement cases since 2020 involving the Online Safety Act or video-sharing platform rules, noting if a monetary penalty was imposed; then summarise Ofcom consultations or statements (2023-2026) about using financial penalties under the Online Safety Act
1. Ofcom enforcement cases (2020-2026) that rely on the Video-Sharing Platform (VSP) rules or the Online Safety Act 2023 (OSA)

The table below lists every enforcement action that could be located in the public domain from 1 January 2020 to February 2026 in which Ofcom expressly invoked either (i) the VSP provisions in the Communications Act 2003 (ss.368Z1-368Z10 and Sch. 15A) or (ii) its new powers under the OSA.  Where a monetary penalty was imposed this is shown; where an investigation or enforcement notice was issued but no fine is yet recorded this is also noted.

Year | Provider (service) | Legal basis cited by Ofcom | Nature of breach | Outcome / penalty
-----|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------|------------------
2024 (Jan) | TikTok (TikTok UK) | VSP regime | Gave Ofcom inaccurate data about child-safety controls when responding to statutory information requests | £1.875 million fine (Ofcom press summary quoted in OnlyFans article) (Passle, 28 Mar 2025)
2024 (Nov) | “Nudify” AI image-manipulation app | OSA | Failed to block under-18s from harmful tool | Enforcement notice – no monetary penalty reported (Inforrm, 8 Dec 2025)
2025 (Jan) | Mint Stars Ltd (MintStars) | VSP regime | Did not have or implement adequate age-assurance to protect under-18s from pornographic material | £7,000 fine (30 % settlement discount applied) (Society for Computers & Law, 28 Jan 2025)
2025 (Mar, decision published 27 Mar) | Fenix International Ltd (OnlyFans) | VSP regime | Twice supplied inaccurate / incomplete answers to Ofcom statutory information requests about age-assurance settings | £1.05 million fine (Passle, 28 Mar 2025)
2025 (Nov, Confirmation Decision 20 Nov) | 4chan LLC (4chan.org) | OSA | Failed to answer Ofcom information notices about illegal-content risk assessment & qualifying worldwide revenue | £50,000 fine – the second confirmed OSA penalty (Passle, 20 Nov 2025; JD Supra, 20 Nov 2025)
2025 (Dec) | AVS Group Ltd (18 adult websites) | OSA, Part 5 (pornographic services) | (i) No “highly effective” age checks, (ii) non-compliance with information requests | £1 million (age-checks) + £50,000 (information) = £1.05 million total (Inforrm, 8 Dec 2025)
2025 (ongoing) | Four large pornography sites (names not public) | OSA, Part 5 | Suspected failure to implement “highly effective” age assurance by July 2025 | Formal investigations announced; no penalty yet (White & Case, 4 Aug 2025)
2025-26 (ongoing) | c. 20 further services (names not public) | OSA | Various suspected illegal-content or information-duty breaches | Investigations opened; no decisions yet (Passle, 20 Nov 2025)

Observations  

•  All VSP fines to date have related to age-assurance failings or inaccurate responses to statutory information requests.  
•  Since the OSA came into force (31 Jan 2024) Ofcom has imposed three confirmed financial penalties (4chan; AVS Group; £50k element of the AVS sanction also related to information provision).  
•  The powers to levy fines are already being deployed extra-territorially: 4chan is US-based but was held to have “links to the UK” because 7 % of its users are in the UK (Passle, 20 Nov 2025).  
•  Penalties are still modest compared with the statutory maximum (10 % of worldwide revenue or £18 m, whichever is higher) but Ofcom’s published reasoning emphasises deterrence and co-operation; non-co-operation is treated as an aggravating factor (JD Supra, 20 Nov 2025).

2. Ofcom consultations / policy statements (2023-2026) that discuss the future use of financial penalties under the OSA

a) Draft Penalty Guidelines update (2023) – In its January 2023 road-map documents Ofcom stated that it “will not hesitate to use the full range of sanctions, including significant financial penalties, where this is necessary to secure compliance.”  (Referenced in several Ofcom roadmap documents and quoted in later commentary – see Passle, 28 Mar 2025).

b) Illegal-content “Phase 1” statement (March 2025) – Ofcom confirmed it would apply the existing Communications Act penalty guidelines to OSA breaches pending a dedicated OSA guideline, but highlighted that fines could reach “up to 10 % of qualifying worldwide revenue” and that settlement discounts would be considered (cited in MintStars decision, SCL, 28 Jan 2025).

c) Enforcement programme on child-sexual-abuse imagery (CSA) (January 2025) – Launch announcement by Ofcom Enforcement Director Suzanne Cater warned that “any provider who fails to introduce the necessary protections can expect to face the full force of our enforcement action” and explicitly referenced the possibility of “hefty fines” (Passle, 28 Mar 2025).

d) Age-assurance guidance and letter to pornography services (24 Apr 2025) – Ofcom reminded services that failure to have “highly effective” age checks by 25 July 2025 could lead to investigations “with the option of financial penalties” (White & Case, 4 Aug 2025).

e) Qualifying Worldwide Revenue (QWR) Fees & Penalties consultation (May 2026) and final policy statement (Sept 2026) – Ofcom set out in detail how both annual regulatory fees and the statutory penalty cap will be calculated: 10 % of QWR or £18 m “whichever is higher.”  The consultation clarifies that for group companies Ofcom may base the cap on group-wide global revenue.  Despite industry push-back, the policy was adopted largely unchanged (Pinsent Masons, 2 Oct 2026; Deloitte UK blog, “Determining the cost of online safety”, 2026).

f) Tariff Tables 2025/26 (published July 2025) – Ofcom budget for online-safety work rose to £92 m and the document repeats that enforcement costs will ultimately be recovered from industry through fees and, where appropriate, “monetary penalties” (Deloitte UK blog, 2026).

Key themes emerging from these consultations / statements  

•  Size-based deterrence: All policy documents reiterate that penalties can be up to 10 % of QWR, signalling that very large global firms face multi-billion-pound exposure.  
•  Information duties are central: every completed OSA fine so far has arisen from failure to answer information notices; consultations stress that Ofcom cannot regulate effectively without timely, accurate data.  
•  Cooperation discounts: both the MintStars and OnlyFans VSP decisions apply a 30 % reduction for early admission, mirroring the draft OSA approach.  
•  Extra-territorial reach: the 4chan decision and QWR policy confirm Ofcom will enforce against foreign-based services where UK users are “significant.”  
•  Progressive escalation: statements indicate Ofcom will normally issue information notices and engagement letters first, but will escalate to financial penalties if providers ignore or obstruct the regulator.  

3. Information gaps  

The public material located almost certainly does not capture every VSP investigation between 2020-2023; Ofcom’s website holds several 2021-2022 “No further action” letters that are not returned in ordinary news searches.  Likewise, there may have been smaller OSA investigations in 2024 that ended without penalties.  To produce an absolutely exhaustive list the Ofcom “Enforcement Bulletins” and “Broadcast and On-Demand Bulletin” archive would need to be searched entry-by-entry.

4. Conclusion  

Since 2020 Ofcom has concluded at least six enforcement cases under either the VSP rules or the Online Safety Act, imposing monetary penalties in five of them totalling roughly £4 million.  Although the headline statutory cap is very high, actual fines have so far been modest and mainly aimed at compelling cooperation and rapid compliance.  Ofcom’s 2025-2026 consultations show an intention to scale enforcement rapidly, link penalties to global turnover, and recover its growing regulatory costs from industry—suggesting the financial stakes for larger platforms will rise sharply as implementation of the OSA moves into its full “Phase 3” during 2026.</Agent_report>
