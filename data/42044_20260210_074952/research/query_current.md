Analysis:
The key uncertainty is whether, between now (10 Feb 2026) and 1 May 2026, Ofcom will issue any public enforcement outcome under the UK Online Safety Act that explicitly lists a monetary penalty. To judge likelihood we need: 
• Evidence of any fines already issued (none are widely known, but must confirm).  
• Signals about Ofcom’s enforcement timetable—e.g., statements that the regulator plans to start formal enforcement or has opened investigations likely to culminate in fines soon.  
• Commentary from legal, tech-policy, or financial press about early test cases and potential targets (large platforms, porn sites, encrypted-messaging services, etc.).  
Therefore, searches should focus on: Ofcom’s enforcement page updates, policy announcements, press releases, and news articles since Royal Assent (Oct 2023) discussing impending or actual fines under the Act.
