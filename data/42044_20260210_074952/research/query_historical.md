Analysis:
Our goal is to understand how quickly and how often Ofcom has imposed monetary penalties after receiving new statutory powers, and whether any enforcement actions under the Online Safety Act have already occurred. Useful historical context includes:  
• The Online Safety Act timeline (Royal Assent in 2023, staged commencement orders, consultations).  
• Ofcom’s history of issuing fines in other regimes (broadcasting, telecoms, video-sharing platform rules) to gauge typical lag from new power to first fine.  
• Any Ofcom press releases or enforcement pages mentioning “Online Safety” plus “financial penalty” or “monetary penalty.”  
• Recent news coverage on expected enforcement intensity and potential early fines.  
These pieces will inform the outside view of whether a published enforcement decision with a stated amount is likely before 1 May 2026.
