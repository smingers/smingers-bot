This systemic issue is part of a long-standing pattern of technological misuse, with online abuse, non-consensual intimate images, and technology-facilitated violence against women and girls (TFVAWG) having been critically examined for over a decade. Despite widespread acknowledgment of legal and regulatory gaps, reform has been slow and incremental. The UK\u2019s Data Use and Access Act 2025 introduces a new offence recognizing AI-generated abuse as equally harmful, but its delayed implementation\u2014despite the government\u2019s commitment to halve violence against women and girls\u2014raises concerns about urgency. Ofcom\u2019s guidance on VAWG, while improved, remains voluntary, and enforcement relies heavily on platform cooperation, raising questions about agility in responding to rapidly evolving technologies like generative AI. The current regulatory approach, which intervenes primarily after crises, risks normalizing harm. The authors argue for a shift toward preventive regulation, urging Ofcom to use its existing powers proactively. They propose establishing an independent observatory on TFVAWG to provide centralized oversight, real-time evidence, and clearer reporting pathways for victims. Without such systemic, pre-emptive action, online safety will continue to be reactive, with women and girls bearing the cost of technological progress. The article concludes by questioning whether the UK can break the cycle of reactive regulation and act before abuse becomes visible and politically unavoidable.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 04:00 AM\nSource:[The Big Issue](https://www.bigissue.com/opinion/why-the-internet-needs-to-be-safer-for-women/)\n\n**UK Announces Updated Framework for Financial Sanctions Enforcement**\nOn 29 January 2026, the UK Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) published its response to a public consultation on proposed changes to its enforcement framework for financial sanctions, following a cross-government review in 2025. OFSI confirmed it will implement all five key proposals to strengthen enforcement, increase transparency, and enhance deterrence. The updated Enforcement and Monetary Penalties guidance will take effect in February 2026, with the exception of the proposed doubling of the maximum statutory penalty\u2014from \u00a31 million or half the breach value to \u00a32 million or the full breach value\u2014which requires parliamentary approval. Key measures include: (1) a new case assessment matrix introducing a 30% voluntary disclosure and cooperation discount (down from 50% for serious cases), with discretion retained by OFSI; (2) a Settlement Scheme offering up to 20% discount if a resolution is reached within 30 business days, without requiring admission of breach; (3) an Early Account Scheme (EAS) allowing up to 20% discount for early, comprehensive disclosure and engagement; (4) a streamlined process for information, reporting, and licensing offences with fixed penalties of \u00a35,000 or \u00a310,000 and a 15-business day representations window; and (5) increased focus on prioritizing cases with the greatest deterrent or compliance impact. The framework allows for a potential combined discount of up to 70% if all criteria are met. OFSI reported 240 active cases as of April 2025, up from 172 in April 2023. On 26 January 2026, OFSI announced an \u00a3160,000 fine against a UK financial institution for 24 violations of Russia sanctions, including failures in screening systems and PEP escalation, reduced by 50% due to prompt voluntary disclosure and cooperation. Companies are advised to review record-keeping, develop crisis management plans, and prepare for increased enforcement scrutiny.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 08:14 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/uk-announces-updated-framework-for-5601981/)\n\n**OFSI To Introduce New Enforcement Framework**\nOn 29 January 2026, the UK's Office of Financial Sanctions Implementation (OFSI) published its consultation response detailing major reforms to its financial sanctions enforcement framework. The changes, stemming from a 2024 cross-government review, include doubling the statutory maximum civil penalty to the greater of \u00a32 million or 100% of the breach value\u2014requiring future legislative approval. OFSI will implement non-legislative changes in February 2026 via updated guidance, including a new case assessment matrix to enhance transparency in penalty determination. A revised voluntary disclosure and co-operation discount of up to 30% will apply across all severity levels, replacing the previous tiered system. A formal settlement scheme will now consider cases involving historical circumvention on a case-by-case basis, following public feedback. The Early Account Scheme (EAS) will allow up to a 20% penalty reduction for early, comprehensive disclosures. For information, reporting, and licensing offences, fixed penalties of \u00a35,000 (standard) or \u00a310,000 (aggravated) will be introduced, with a shortened 15-business-day representation period. OFSI will also retain discretion to issue warnings, public disclosures, or take no action for minor technical breaches to avoid over-penalisation. Together, the Voluntary Disclosure, EAS, and settlement discounts could reduce penalties by up to 70% of the baseline. However, OFSI will continue publishing all enforcement actions, including low-value penalties, and businesses remain exposed to parallel civil or criminal proceedings. The reforms aim to strengthen deterrence, encourage early co-operation, and increase accountability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 04:13 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/ofsi-to-introduce-new-enforcement-4981573/)\n\n**Calls to train garda\u00ed to identify sex-for-rent offers**\nA coalition of civil society organisations in Ireland, including Akidwa, Aontas na Mac L\u00e9inn in \u00c9irinn, the Irish Council for International Students, the National Women's Council, Rape Crisis Ireland, and Threshold, has submitted legislation to criminalise 'sex for rent' practices. The proposed law introduces two offences: offering accommodation in exchange for sexual activity and advertising such arrangements. Penalties include fines of up to \u20ac5,000, with the criminalisation based solely on the offer or advertisement\u2014no proof of actual sexual activity is required. The legislation applies to both formal rentals and informal 'rent-a-room' arrangements, covering online, text, print, radio, and television advertisements. The coalition describes the bill as a 'significant and long-overdue step' but stresses that effective implementation requires additional measures: access to legal and trauma-informed support for victims, inclusion of sex-for-rent exploitation in Ireland\u2019s domestic, sexual and gender-based violence (DSGBV) strategy, dedicated garda\u00ed training focused on victim-centred responses, stronger protections for informal renters, and enforcement of online platforms through proactive moderation, clear reporting mechanisms, and swift removal of exploitative content under the Online Safety Commissioner\u2019s authority. The push follows an Irish Examiner investigation in December 2021 that uncovered online sex-for-rent advertisements.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 03:46 PM\nSource:[Irish Examiner](https://www.irishexaminer.com/news/arid-41790452.html)\n\n**Minister of Social Solidarity Demands Strict Penalties for Non-Compliant Internet Companies to Protect Children**\nDr. Mayssa Merzi, Minister of Social Solidarity, called for stringent penalties in the new law being prepared by the Egyptian Parliament to protect children from online risks. She proposed imposing fines of 2% to 4% of global revenues on internet companies that fail to enforce age verification for users. The fines would be directed toward a special fund supporting education and health in Egypt, with the penalties being mandatory. The minister emphasized that countries use three main tools to enforce age verification: having a legal representative for negotiation, requiring platforms to remove harmful or inappropriate content (citing that one platform removed 2.9 million inappropriate videos in 2025), and mandating parental control tools. She stressed that legal responsibility lies with the platform, not the parent, and that platforms must provide data and submit reports within state-determined timeframes. She also advocated for legislation prohibiting underage registration, establishing regulatory frameworks for data handling, and combating misleading advertisements on social media. She cited examples of individuals appearing in multiple videos with conflicting personas\u2014such as depressed or frustrated\u2014to highlight the psychological risks. The minister emphasized the need for risk assessments to identify hotspots of harmful online behavior and noted that 16 individuals at the Al-Idmam Center for addiction treatment are suffering from digital addiction and gambling. She described the issue as a national and security priority, stressing that children are innocent victims of monetized content and advertising. She praised the TV series 'Lega Wala Qalb Bajad' and noted that President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has prioritized digital safety for five years. Egypt, she stated, was a pioneer in this area, having initiated the discussion at the National Council for Women over five years ago. She referenced international models, including the UK\u2019s robust online safety law, and noted Egypt ranks 22nd globally in online safety readiness, with the capacity to implement strong measures. She warned that children\u2019s attention spans have dropped to just 8 seconds, and 6 out of 10 internet-using children become socially isolated, calling for urgent action to shape the digital future.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 02:09 PM\nSource:[\u0645\u0635\u0631\u0627\u0648\u064a.\u0643\u0648\u0645](https://www.masrawy.com/news/news_egypt/details/2026/2/9/2940030/%D9%88%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B6%D8%A7%D9%85%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B7%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8-%D8%A8%D8%B9%D9%82%D9%88%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AF%D8%B9%D8%A9-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A5%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%B1%D9%86%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AE%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%AF-%D8%B3%D9%86-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%AF%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%86)\n\n**Minister of Social Solidarity: Online Risks Threaten National Security**\nDr. Maya Morsi, Minister of Social Solidarity, stated during a parliamentary hearing on February 9, 2026, that online risks pose a national security threat, emphasizing that Egypt has been proactive in addressing digital safety for children for over five years. Speaking before the Information and Communications Technology Committee of the Egyptian Parliament, she highlighted that the country has taken early action through the National Council for Women and stressed the need for a safe digital environment. She noted that some countries hold both companies and national authorities legally responsible for child safety online, and cited the UK\u2019s robust internet safety law as a global benchmark. Morsi reported that children\u2019s attention span has dropped to just 8 seconds, and 6 out of 10 children using the internet have become emotionally distant from their families. She proposed a legal framework to regulate social media use by minors, including mandatory age verification via AI, a minimum age of 14 for digital identity comprehension, and strict penalties\u20142% to 4% of global revenues\u2014for non-compliant platforms. These fines would fund a dedicated national fund for education and health. She also called for mandatory reporting by platforms, parental control tools, and the removal of harmful content, citing that one platform deleted 2.9 million inappropriate videos in 2025. Morsi emphasized that platform liability, not parental responsibility, should be enforced, and warned that digital addiction and gambling are already affecting 16 individuals at the Al-3ezma Center for Addiction Treatment. She concluded by asserting that protecting children online is a national and security priority, requiring urgent legislative action and public awareness.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 01:29 PM\nSource:[\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645](https://gate.ahram.org.eg/News/5527003.aspx)\n\n**UK Teams Up with Microsoft to Detect Deepfakes Online**\nThe United Kingdom has announced a partnership with Microsoft to develop a system for detecting deepfakes circulating online, aiming to combat harmful and deceptive AI-generated content. This initiative follows the UK's criminalization of non-consensual intimate image creation, with the goal of establishing consistent detection standards and evaluating detection tools. The system will help identify deepfakes used for sexual abuse, fraud, and identity theft, while also enabling government and law enforcement to identify gaps in current detection capabilities. The effort is part of broader regulatory actions, including a formal investigation launched by Ofcom, the UK's independent regulatory body, against X (formerly Twitter) under the Online Safety Act for allegedly generating and sharing non-consensual sexual images of women and minors using Grok. Ofcom stated that reports of such misuse have been 'deeply concerning' and emphasized that platforms must protect UK citizens from illegal content. Under the Online Safety Act, Ofcom's process involves gathering and analyzing evidence to determine violations, potentially leading to provisional decisions involving financial penalties or service disruptions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 05:00 PM\nSource:[20 minutos](https://www.20minutos.es/tecnologia/inteligencia-artificial/gran-bretana-trabajara-microsoft-detectar-deepfakes-circulan-internet_6930824_0.html)\n\n**Draft Law on Social Media Restrictions for Children Under 15 to be Submitted to Turkish Parliament**\nA draft law proposing restrictions on social media use for children under 15 is expected to be submitted to the Turkish Grand National Assembly (TBMM) soon. The TBMM Research Services Presidency conducted a study highlighting the rapid rise in the use of video-sharing and social media platforms, emphasizing their significant impact on daily life, public discourse, and fundamental rights. The study noted that misleading content, hate speech, incitement to violence, and material harmful to child development have accelerated the need for regulatory action. It examined EU-level regulations, particularly the revised Audiovisual Media Services Directive (2018), which now includes online video-sharing services and mandates protective measures such as age verification, parental controls, prohibition of commercial use of children's personal data, content transparency requirements, reporting and complaint mechanisms, clear terms of service, compliance with EU advertising rules, and media literacy initiatives. The Digital Services Act (DSA), effective from February 17, 2024, applies to major digital platforms and imposes fines up to 6% of global turnover for non-compliance, with additional penalties of up to 1% for false or incomplete information and periodic fines of up to 5% of daily average revenue. The study also detailed enforcement actions in several European countries: Germany's Federal Network Agency can impose daily fines of up to 5% of daily global revenue and restrict platform access for serious violations; the UK's OFCOM can impose fines of up to 10% of annual turnover or \u00a318 million, and even block access to platforms; France's ARCOM can suspend services, issue public notices, and impose fines up to 20 million euros or 6% of global turnover for hate content; Italy's AGCOM can issue emergency content removal orders and fines from 30,000 to 600,000 euros; and Spain's CNMC enforces regulations based on the EU directive with fines up to 1% of annual turnover. In the Netherlands, media content is regulated by the Media Authority, while consumer and market oversight of social media falls under the Consumer and Markets Authority.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 08:11 AM\nSource:[Son Dakika](https://www.sondakika.com/haber/haber-cocuklar-icin-sosyal-medya-duzenlemeleri-19549128/)\n\n**Turkey\u2019s Parliamentary Review of European Digital Oversight Models for Child Protection on Social Media**\nThe Turkish Grand National Assembly (TBMM) has been studying strict digital oversight models across Europe to inform legislation on social media use by children under 15.

The EU\u2019s Digital Services Act (DSA), effective from February 17, 2024, mandates that online platforms\u2014including social media, video-sharing services, app stores, and search engines\u2014comply with transparency, content moderation, and user safety rules. Violations may result in administrative fines of up to 6% of the previous year\u2019s global turnover, with additional daily penalties of up to 5% of daily average revenue for ongoing non-compliance. Germany imposes fines up to 5% of daily global revenue for non-compliance with Federal Network Agency orders, and can restrict platform access in severe cases. The UK\u2019s Ofcom can impose fines of up to 10% of annual global revenue or \u00a318 million, and may block access via ISPs for persistent violations. France\u2019s ARCOM can issue fines up to 6% of global turnover or \u20ac20 million for hate speech, and can order service suspensions or DNS-level blocking. Italy\u2019s AGCOM has emergency content removal powers and can impose fines up to \u20ac600,000 or 1% of annual turnover. Spain\u2019s CNMC enforces EU directives through national law, and the Netherlands uses a dual system with the Media Authority overseeing content and the Consumer and Markets Authority handling social media.

These include safeguarding the public from incitement to violence, hate, racism, or terrorism; protecting children\u2019s physical, mental, and moral development through age verification and parental controls; preventing commercial exploitation of children\u2019s data; requiring transparency in content labeling; ensuring accessible reporting and complaint channels; providing clear terms of service; complying with EU advertising rules; and promoting media literacy. The EU's Digital Services Act (DSA), effective from February 17, 2024, was also analyzed, covering platforms such as app stores, search engines, marketplaces, social media, and video-sharing services. Under the DSA, violations may result in administrative fines up to 6% of the platform\u2019s previous fiscal year\u2019s global turnover, 1% for providing false or incomplete information, and periodic fines up to 5% of daily average or global turnover. In Germany, the Federal Network Agency can impose daily penalties up to 5% of daily global revenue for non-compliance, with fines up to 300,000 euros for severe violations, including access restrictions. The UK\u2019s Ofcom can impose fines up to 10% of annual turnover or \u00a318 million, and may block access to platforms. France\u2019s ARCOM can suspend services, issue public statements, and impose fines up to 20 million euros or 6% of global turnover for hate content. Italy\u2019s AGCOM can issue rapid takedown orders and fines up to 600,000 euros or 1% of annual turnover. Spain\u2019s CNMC enforces regulations under the 2018 EU directive, adapted via the 2022 Audiovisual Communication Act. In the Netherlands, the Media Authority oversees video content, while the Consumer and Markets Authority regulates social media. The study underscores the EU and member states\u2019 coordinated, stringent approach to digital platform accountability.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 08:00 AM\nSource:[Haberler](https://www.haberler.com/politika/meclis-avrupa-ulkelerinin-sosyal-medya-19549087-haberi/)\n\n**Ofcom issue update on investigation into sick forum as suicide substance seller is jailed - The Mirror**\nOfcom is advancing its investigation into a pro-suicide forum under the Online Safety Act, following concerns over its role in promoting a lethal substance linked to at least 133 UK deaths, with victims predominantly in their early 20s and the youngest known victim aged 13. The US-based forum, which was the subject of Ofcom's first enforcement action under the Act starting in April 2025, implemented a geo-block to restrict UK access but included instructions on how UK users could bypass it. Ofcom has issued a notice stating it is working toward a provisional decision on breaches of the Act, and if concerns are not resolved, it may seek a court order to disrupt the site\u2019s operations. Potential penalties include fines of up to \u00a318 million or 10% of qualifying worldwide revenue, whichever is greater. A final decision is expected by the end of the first quarter of 2026, after which the provider will have the opportunity to respond. In October 2025, bereaved families and a survivor urged the UK government to hold a public inquiry, claiming the state was too slow to act. A report by the Molly Rose Foundation revealed that three government departments had received dozens of warnings from coroners about the risks posed by the forum and the substance. Meanwhile, Miles Cross, who sold the substance via the forum using a QR code and bank account, was sentenced to 14 years in prison in January 2026. He was found guilty of selling the chemical to vulnerable individuals, with two deaths linked to his sales. His Honour Judge Rhys Rowlands described the case as 'rare and extremely serious' and emphasized the need for deterrence. The Mirror has chosen not to name the forum or the substance to avoid amplifying their reach.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 08, 2026 09:49 AM\nSource:[Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/ofcom-issue-update-investigation-sick-36511828)\n\n**Lessons in online safety: Ofcom's \u00a31 million fine against AVS and end of year review**\nOfcom imposed a \u00a31 million fine on AVS Limited, the largest penalty to date under the UK's Online Safety Act (OSA), due to ineffective age assurance measures. The company\u2019s method\u2014requiring users to upload an adult photo\u2014was deemed easily circumventable by children. An additional \u00a350,000 fine was levied for failure to respond to an Ofcom information request. Concurrently, Ofcom released two key reports: the Sector Response Report, which highlights widespread adoption of 'highly effective' age assurance by top 10 adult websites post-25 July 2024 deadline, and the Risk Assessment Report, which identifies deficiencies in 104 risk assessments received in 2025, including inadequate justification of risk levels, insufficient mitigation plans, and lack of updates for new AI integrations. Ofcom will prioritize enforcement in 2026, focusing on the top 100 UK adult sites, requesting updated risk assessments, and scrutinizing child safety measures from Meta, TikTok, Pinterest, and YouTube. The regulator is also addressing concerns about over-moderation restricting access to non-harmful content and persistent illegal hate speech and terrorist content, launching a detailed review of one platform\u2019s moderation systems with potential expansion in 2026. Additionally, Ofcom continues its focus on protecting women and girls online, with a progress report planned for May 2027. The actions signal Ofcom\u2019s increasing enforcement posture, warning industry players of expectations for 'meaningful, measurable improvements' in 2026, despite challenges in balancing regulation with major platform accountability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 12, 2025 07:06 PM\nSource:[Lexology](https://www.lexology.com/library/detail.aspx?g=6d6ff02f-c454-45e4-9611-df625a4dda7f)\n\n**Ofcom vows to 'name and shame' over online sexism**\nOfcom has published new guidelines aimed at making the internet safer for women and girls, vowing to 'name and shame' online platforms that fail to comply, though the measures are non-binding recommendations rather than legally enforceable rules. The regulator acknowledges that current reporting processes for online abuse are 'soul destroying' and aims to improve them by enabling users to report multiple abusive accounts at once. Ofcom boss Dame Melanie Dawes described the initiative as 'lots of small steps' that collectively enhance online safety. Critics, including Andrea Simon of the End Violence Against Women Coalition, argue that without a legally enforced mandatory code of practice, tech platforms will not take the issue seriously enough. Influencers like Demi Brown and Sahra-Aisha Muhammad-Jones shared personal experiences of online abuse, emphasizing that women should not have to 'become resilient' to survive online spaces. Former secretary of state Baroness Nicky Morgan expressed disappointment that the guidance lacks legal force, noting that 'some just won't care' and will continue allowing harmful content. The UK government's Technology Secretary Liz Kendall asserted that tech firms have the technical tools to block misogyny. However, Ofcom has only issued two fines under the Online Safety Act since its 2023 implementation, with 4Chan refusing to pay its \u00a320,000 penalty and launching legal action in the US. Concerns persist over Ofcom's limited enforcement power and its balancing act between online safety and freedom of speech, especially amid pressure from US officials. Campaigners like the Molly Rose Foundation and former cyclist Chris Boardman argue that existing laws are insufficient, citing cases such as racist abuse against Lioness Jess Carter and death threats to tennis player Katie Boulter. Boardman called for using AI and algorithms\u2014currently used to drive engagement\u2014to proactively prevent abuse rather than reacting after it occurs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 11:53 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/ofcom-vows-name-shame-over-115301541.html)\n\n**Lessons Learnt from Ofcom's First Enforcement of the Online Safety Act**\nOfcom has issued its first confirmed financial penalty under the UK's Online Safety Act (OSA), targeting the US-based platform 4chan, with a \u00a350,000 fine for failing to provide required information, including its illegal content risk assessment and qualifying worldwide revenue. The Confirmation Decision outlines Ofcom's procedural rigor, emphasizing its authority to enforce the OSA extraterritorially, even over companies without a physical presence in the UK. Ofcom asserts that 4chan\u2019s 7% UK user base constitutes a 'significant number of UK users,' satisfying the statutory 'links to the UK' test. The decision also rebuts 4chan\u2019s claim that the OSA violates US First Amendment rights, stating such rights do not bind foreign regulators. Ofcom highlights that lack of cooperation is an aggravating factor in penalty determination, while prior breaches may lead to harsher penalties. The decision warns that geo-blocking is not a foolproof defense, as mirrored domains or circumvention tools like VPNs may still allow UK access. Key lessons for online platforms include engaging proactively with Ofcom, avoiding non-cooperation, recognizing that overseas status does not exempt them from enforcement, and understanding that Ofcom\u2019s processes are predictable and escalating. This enforcement marks the beginning of Ofcom\u2019s broader enforcement strategy under the OSA.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 06:37 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/lessons-learnt-from-ofcom-s-first-8708811/)\n\n**Lessons Learnt from Ofcom's First Enforcement of the Online Safety Act - Lessons from 4chan**\nOfcom has issued its first confirmed financial penalty under the UK's Online Safety Act (OSA), targeting the US-based platform 4chan for failing to provide required information, including its illegal content risk assessment and qualifying worldwide revenue. The penalty, part of a broader enforcement action, follows a detailed investigation that began on 10 June 2025, with Ofcom offering two introductory meetings in March and April 2025 that 4chan did not respond to. Ofcom confirmed its jurisdiction over 4chan despite its lack of physical presence in the UK, citing that the platform has a 'significant number of UK users'\u20147% of its user base\u2014sufficient to establish 'links to the UK' under the OSA. Ofcom rejected 4chan\u2019s argument that the OSA infringes on US First Amendment rights, stating that the First Amendment binds only the US government and not foreign regulators. The decision highlights that lack of cooperation is an aggravating factor in penalty determination, while prior breaches and non-compliance gains are considered for future enforcement. Ofcom also warned that restricting UK access via geo-blocking is not a foolproof defense, as mirrored domains or circumvention tools like VPNs may still allow UK access. Platforms are advised to proactively engage with Ofcom to demonstrate cooperation and potentially reduce penalties. This enforcement sets a precedent for future actions, particularly against overseas platforms, signaling Ofcom\u2019s intent to enforce the OSA extra-territorially and with procedural transparency.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[The National Law Review - A Free To Use Nationwide Database of Legal Publications](https://natlawreview.com/article/lessons-learnt-ofcoms-first-enforcement-online-safety-act-lessons-4chan)\n\n**Ofcom fines 4chan \u00a320K for Online Safety Act failings**\nOfcom, the UK's Online Safety Act regulator, has fined 4chan \u00a320,000 ($26,680) for failing to protect children from harmful content and for not complying with information requests related to two matters. The fine could increase by up to \u00a36,000\u2014\u00a3100 per day for up to 60 days\u2014if 4chan continues to ignore its obligations. The company can stop further penalties by providing its illegal content risk assessments and qualifying worldwide revenue data to Ofcom. This enforcement action follows an investigation that began on June 10, 2024, and includes a request for documents made on April 14, 2024, which 4chan has not yet fulfilled. The maximum penalties under the Online Safety Act are \u00a318 million ($24 million) or 10% of an organization's qualifying worldwide revenue, whichever is greater. Ofcom also announced provisional decisions to take action against file-sharing service Im.ge and pornography provider AVS Group Ltd for failing to respond to information requests\u2014Im.ge over its duty to prevent child sexual abuse material (CSAM), and AVS Group over age-check mechanisms. Both have the right to appeal before final decisions are made. Another porn provider, Youngtek Solutions Ltd, is under an expanded investigation for similar failures. Tech Secretary Liz Kendall stated the Online Safety Act is 'a lifeline' and emphasized that platforms must protect users from illegal content like self-harm or suicide encouragement. Since March 17, 2025, Ofcom has opened 21 investigations and launched five enforcement programs. Some platforms, including Krakenfiles, Nippydrive, Nippyshare, and Nippyspace, avoided further action by geo-blocking UK users, leading Ofcom to close those cases. The regulator will continue monitoring them and may reopen investigations if necessary. A suicide forum has also implemented UK IP geo-blocking, and Ofcom will monitor its compliance. The UK government does not plan to ban VPNs due to their legitimate uses, but will act if platforms promote them to children to bypass safety measures. Ofcom is proposing mandatory use of hash-matching technology\u2014automatically identifying and removing known illegal content like CSAM by comparing digital fingerprints\u2014to improve enforcement. This technology was adopted by 1Fichier.com and Gofile.io after initial compliance concerns, allowing them to avoid further penalties. Suzanne Cater, Ofcom\u2019s director of enforcement, said the actions send a clear message: non-compliance will lead to robust enforcement, while some services are improving safety measures in response to regulatory pressure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 11:10 AM\nSource:[TheRegister.com](https://www.theregister.com/2025/10/13/4chan_ofcom_fine/)\n\n**Britain's Landmark Action Against 4chan Over Online Safety Violations | Technology**\nBritain's media regulator, Ofcom, imposed a \u00a320,000 fine on 4chan, a U.S.-based internet forum, for failing to comply with requests to assess risks of illegal content under the UK's new Online Safety Act. This marks the first enforcement action under the regime, which aims to protect children and vulnerable users from harmful online content. Technology Minister Liz Kendall endorsed the move, affirming the government's commitment to combating illegal content and safeguarding minors. In response, 4chan and another forum site, Kiwi Farms, have sued Ofcom in the U.S., arguing that the enforcement violates U.S. free speech rights. Ofcom has warned of escalating fines and potential restrictions on internet access if platforms do not comply, underscoring the growing international tension over cross-border online safety regulation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 09:52 AM\nSource:[Devdiscourse](https://www.devdiscourse.com/article/technology/3661592-britains-landmark-action-against-4chan-over-online-safety-violations)\n\n**Charities warn Ofcom too soft on Online Safety Act violators**\nCharities have warned that Ofcom\u2019s enforcement of the Online Safety Act (OSA) is too lenient, citing opaque processes and a lack of robust penalties for non\u2011compliant platforms.  CEO Andy\u202fBurrows of the Molly\u202fRose\u202fFoundation said, 'I do not get the impression that the companies are quaking in their boots at Ofcom's enforcement approach,' and noted that some enforcement actions are under supervision, making it unclear whether they will be 'sufficiently industrious.'  Baroness\u202fKidron of the 5Rights\u202fFoundation echoed this view, adding that Ofcom must truly test its regulatory powers or it will fail to provide ministers with evidence needed for amendments.  She also criticised the regulator\u2019s approach to age\u2011assurance, arguing that privacy\u2011preserving mechanisms are essential and that Ofcom should act swiftly to maintain public trust.  The article reports that Ofcom has begun investigating 47 websites and apps suspected of non\u2011compliance and has already launched investigations into 69 sites and apps, with a focus on age\u2011verification and safe\u2011harbor provisions.  It also highlights a six\u2011fold increase in \u201ccom groups\u201d (teen\u2011boy cyber\u2011criminal networks) between 2022 and 2024, a trend that the Molly\u202fRose\u202fFoundation finds particularly alarming.  Ofcom\u2019s spokesperson stated that the majority of the top 100 adult sites in the UK now deploy age checks, covering nearly two\u2011thirds of daily visits, and that the regulator is pursuing swift enforcement actions.  Overall, the piece presents stakeholder concerns and factual updates on Ofcom\u2019s enforcement activities without overt bias.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 10:00 AM\nSource:[TheRegister.com](https://www.theregister.com/2025/09/19/ofcom_osa_enforcement/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
