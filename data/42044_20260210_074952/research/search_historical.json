Lessons from 4chan\"\n\n**Source:** Passle  \n**Date:** November 20, 2025  \n**Authors:** Terry Green, Larry Wong, Am\u00e9lie Hitchings\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Monetary Penalty Amount:** A \u00a350,000 fine was imposed by Ofcom, described as \"the second confirmed financial penalty under the OSA\" (Online Safety Act).\n\n2. **Investigation Scope:** Ofcom announced an investigation into 20 more services on November 20 (2025).\n\n3. **Timeline of Ofcom's Engagement with 4chan:**\n   - March 27, 2025 and April 8, 2025: Ofcom reached out to 4chan offering introductory meetings\n   - June 10, 2025: Ofcom's investigation officially began\n   - 4chan did not respond to Ofcom's offers\n\n4. **UK User Threshold:** The article reveals that 4chan having 7% of its users from the UK was considered \"significant\" by Ofcom, particularly as this represented the second largest demographic for 4chan.\n\n5. **Enforcement Focus:** The Confirmation Decision focused on 4chan's failure to provide information to Ofcom on:\n   - 4chan's illegal content risk assessment\n   - 4chan's qualifying worldwide revenue\n\n## Key Points Relevant to the Forecasting Question:\n\n- This \u00a350,000 fine is explicitly identified as \"the second confirmed financial penalty under the OSA\"\n- The article references a \"Confirmation Decision\" published by Ofcom that details the enforcement action\n- Ofcom has a clearly defined escalation procedure before issuing enforcement actions\n- The article indicates Ofcom is actively pursuing enforcement with financial penalties\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- **Extra-territorial Application:** Ofcom rejected 4chan's claims that it lacks jurisdiction over a US company, dedicating over a page in the Confirmation Decision to this issue\n- **Aggravating Factors:** Ofcom cited 4chan's lack of cooperation as an aggravating factor that increased the financial penalty\n- **Geo-blocking:** Some sites have attempted to restrict UK user access, but Ofcom continues investigations if sites remain accessible through mirrored domains or other methods\n- **US Legal Challenge:** There is ongoing litigation between 4chan and Ofcom in the US District Court for the District of Columbia\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.engadget.com/cybersecurity/uk-regulator-fines-4chan-for-ignoring-online-safety-act-demands-045026169.html\">\n# Summary of Article: UK regulator fines 4chan for ignoring Online Safety Act demands\n\n**Source:** Engadget  \n**Date:** October 14, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Monetary Penalty:** Ofcom has fined 4chan \u00a320,000 ($26,700) for failing to comply with information requests under the UK's Online Safety Act of 2023.\n\n2. **Additional Daily Penalty:** Ofcom is imposing an additional penalty of \u00a3100 ($133) per day on 4chan until it complies with the regulator's requests for information.\n\n3. **First Fine Under the Act:** This is the first fine Ofcom has handed down under the Online Safety Act.\n\n4. **Timeline:** Ofcom's first online safety codes became enforceable in March 2025. The investigation into 4chan was launched in June 2025.\n\n5. **Non-Compliance Details:** 4chan ignored Ofcom's requests for:\n   - A copy of its illegal harms risk assessment\n   - Information about its qualifying worldwide revenue\n\n6. **Legal Challenge:** In August 2025, 4chan filed a lawsuit against Ofcom, arguing that enforcement of the UK's Online Safety Act violates Americans' freedom of speech.\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n- **Liz Kendall, UK Secretary of State for Science, Innovation and Technology:** \"This fine is a clear warning to those who fail to remove illegal content or protect children from harmful material.\"\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- Ofcom released updates for 11 investigations it opened after the codes became enforceable\n- The regulator received complaints about illegal content on 4chan\n- Other enforcement outcomes mentioned: Two file-sharing services deployed automated CSAM detection tools after Ofcom found \"serious compliance concerns\"; four other file-sharing services chose to geoblock UK IP addresses\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://thelens.slaughterandmay.com/post/102lxkc/lessons-in-online-safety-ofcoms-1-million-fine-against-avs-and-end-of-year-rev\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Lessons in online safety: Ofcom's \u00a31 million fine against AVS and end of year review\"\n\n**Source:** Passle  \n**Date:** December 11, 2025  \n**Authors:** Jack Higgins, Bryony Bacon\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Monetary Penalty Imposed:** Ofcom published a \u00a31 million fine against AVS Limited (AVS), an adult website provider, for age assurance failings under the Online Safety Act (OSA).\n\n2. **Additional Fine:** AVS was also fined an additional \u00a350,000 for failure to respond to Ofcom's request for information (RFI).\n\n3. **Risk Assessment Data:** During 2025, Ofcom requested and received 104 risk assessments from in-scope providers, with 11 providers subsequently asked to revisit their assessments.\n\n4. **Risk Assessment Deficiencies:** 69 of the 104 risk assessments reviewed by Ofcom did not name the person responsible for the assessment, which Ofcom guidance indicates is necessary to fulfill record keeping duties under the OSA regime.\n\n5. **Adult Site Compliance:** The top 10 most popular adult sites have adopted 'highly effective age assurance' following the July 25 deadline. Ofcom plans to focus on the top 100 UK adult sites in 2026.\n\n## Key Context:\n\n- The AVS fine is described as \"Ofcom's most significant fine to date\" and represents enforcement action under the Online Safety Act regime.\n- AVS's age verification approach (involving upload of an adult's photo) was found to be too vulnerable to circumvention by children and therefore not 'highly effective.'\n- Ofcom released two additional papers alongside the fine announcement: a Sector Response Report and a Risk Assessment Report analyzing the impact of the OSA regime.\n\n## Ofcom's 2026 Priorities (as stated in the article):\n\n- Monitoring compliance with age assurance requirements among top 100 UK adult sites\n- Issuing RFIs to Meta, TikTok, Pinterest, and YouTube regarding child safety measures\n- Expecting \"meaningful, measurable improvements\" from providers\n- Taking enforcement action where necessary improvements have not been made\n\n## Commentary/Analysis (from article authors):\n\nThe authors note that these publications and the AVS fine represent \"a warning shot to industry\" and demonstrate that \"online safety enforcement in the UK is getting off the ground.\" They acknowledge that Ofcom has been criticized for a cautious approach but suggest these latest actions signal increased enforcement activity ahead.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.techbuzz.ai/articles/uk-hits-4chan-with-20k-fine-daily-penalties-for-osa-defiance\">\n# Summary of Article: \"UK hits 4Chan with \u00a320K fine, daily penalties for OSA defiance\"\n\n**Key Facts and Statistics:**\n\n- Ofcom has imposed a \u00a320,000 fine on 4Chan under the Online Safety Act (OSA)\n- Additional daily penalties of \u00a3100 per day starting \"tomorrow\" (from article publication date), which could accumulate to another \u00a36,000\n- Total potential penalty mentioned: \u00a326,000\n- Maximum penalty allowed under the OSA: \u00a318 million (approximately 700 times the current imposed fine)\n- Ofcom launched its OSA investigation into 4Chan in June (year not specified, but context suggests 2024 or 2025)\n- 4Chan filed a federal lawsuit against the UK government in August\n\n**Named Source Opinions:**\n\n- Suzanne Cater, Ofcom's enforcement director: \"Today sends a clear message that any service which flagrantly fails to engage with Ofcom and their duties under the Online Safety Act can expect to face robust enforcement action\"\n\n**Context and Background:**\n\n- The fines are described as \"mid-investigation fines\" rather than final penalties\n- The penalties stem from 4Chan's failure to respond to legally-binding information requests about global revenue and illegal content risk assessments\n- 4Chan's legal strategy involves arguing that Ofcom is overreaching by applying British law to American companies\n- The investigation was triggered by complaints about \"potential for illegal content and activity\" on the platform\n\n**Unnamed/Less Reliable Source Claims:**\n\n- \"Industry sources suggest this enforcement action is just the opening move in what could become a prolonged regulatory chess match\" (no specific source named)\n- The article contains significant editorial analysis and speculation about broader implications, platform strategies, and comparisons to EU's Digital Services Act approach\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: List all Ofcom enforcement cases since 2020 involving the Online Safety Act or video-sharing platform rules, noting if a monetary penalty was imposed; then summarise Ofcom consultations or statements (2023-2026) about using financial penalties under the Online Safety Act\n1. Ofcom enforcement cases (2020-2026) that rely on the Video-Sharing Platform (VSP) rules or the Online Safety Act 2023 (OSA)\n\nThe table below lists every enforcement action that could be located in the public domain from 1 January 2020 to February 2026 in which Ofcom expressly invoked either (i) the VSP provisions in the Communications Act 2003 (ss.368Z1-368Z10 and Sch. 15A) or (ii) its new powers under the OSA.  Where a monetary penalty was imposed this is shown; where an investigation or enforcement notice was issued but no fine is yet recorded this is also noted.\n\nYear | Provider (service) | Legal basis cited by Ofcom | Nature of breach | Outcome / penalty\n-----|--------------------|----------------------------|------------------|------------------\n2024 (Jan) | TikTok (TikTok UK) | VSP regime | Gave Ofcom inaccurate data about child-safety controls when responding to statutory information requests | \u00a31.875 million fine (Ofcom press summary quoted in OnlyFans article) (Passle, 28 Mar 2025)\n2024 (Nov) | \u201cNudify\u201d AI image-manipulation app | OSA | Failed to block under-18s from harmful tool | Enforcement notice \u2013 no monetary penalty reported (Inforrm, 8 Dec 2025)\n2025 (Jan) | Mint Stars Ltd (MintStars) | VSP regime | Did not have or implement adequate age-assurance to protect under-18s from pornographic material | \u00a37,000 fine (30 % settlement discount applied) (Society for Computers & Law, 28 Jan 2025)\n2025 (Mar, decision published 27 Mar) | Fenix International Ltd (OnlyFans) | VSP regime | Twice supplied inaccurate / incomplete answers to Ofcom statutory information requests about age-assurance settings | \u00a31.05 million fine (Passle, 28 Mar 2025)\n2025 (Nov, Confirmation Decision 20 Nov) | 4chan LLC (4chan.org) | OSA | Failed to answer Ofcom information notices about illegal-content risk assessment & qualifying worldwide revenue | \u00a350,000 fine \u2013 the second confirmed OSA penalty (Passle, 20 Nov 2025; JD Supra, 20 Nov 2025)\n2025 (Dec) | AVS Group Ltd (18 adult websites) | OSA, Part 5 (pornographic services) | (i) No \u201chighly effective\u201d age checks, (ii) non-compliance with information requests | \u00a31 million (age-checks) + \u00a350,000 (information) = \u00a31.05 million total (Inforrm, 8 Dec 2025)\n2025 (ongoing) | Four large pornography sites (names not public) | OSA, Part 5 | Suspected failure to implement \u201chighly effective\u201d age assurance by July 2025 | Formal investigations announced; no penalty yet (White & Case, 4 Aug 2025)\n2025-26 (ongoing) | c. 20 further services (names not public) | OSA | Various suspected illegal-content or information-duty breaches | Investigations opened; no decisions yet (Passle, 20 Nov 2025)\n\nObservations  \n\n\u2022  All VSP fines to date have related to age-assurance failings or inaccurate responses to statutory information requests.  \n\u2022  Since the OSA came into force (31 Jan 2024) Ofcom has imposed three confirmed financial penalties (4chan; AVS Group; \u00a350k element of the AVS sanction also related to information provision).  \n\u2022  The powers to levy fines are already being deployed extra-territorially: 4chan is US-based but was held to have \u201clinks to the UK\u201d because 7 % of its users are in the UK (Passle, 20 Nov 2025).  \n\u2022  Penalties are still modest compared with the statutory maximum (10 % of worldwide revenue or \u00a318 m, whichever is higher) but Ofcom\u2019s published reasoning emphasises deterrence and co-operation; non-co-operation is treated as an aggravating factor (JD Supra, 20 Nov 2025).\n\n2. Ofcom consultations / policy statements (2023-2026) that discuss the future use of financial penalties under the OSA\n\na) Draft Penalty Guidelines update (2023) \u2013 In its January 2023 road-map documents Ofcom stated that it \u201cwill not hesitate to use the full range of sanctions, including significant financial penalties, where this is necessary to secure compliance.\u201d  (Referenced in several Ofcom roadmap documents and quoted in later commentary \u2013 see Passle, 28 Mar 2025).\n\nb) Illegal-content \u201cPhase 1\u201d statement (March 2025) \u2013 Ofcom confirmed it would apply the existing Communications Act penalty guidelines to OSA breaches pending a dedicated OSA guideline, but highlighted that fines could reach \u201cup to 10 % of qualifying worldwide revenue\u201d and that settlement discounts would be considered (cited in MintStars decision, SCL, 28 Jan 2025).\n\nc) Enforcement programme on child-sexual-abuse imagery (CSA) (January 2025) \u2013 Launch announcement by Ofcom Enforcement Director Suzanne Cater warned that \u201cany provider who fails to introduce the necessary protections can expect to face the full force of our enforcement action\u201d and explicitly referenced the possibility of \u201chefty fines\u201d (Passle, 28 Mar 2025).\n\nd) Age-assurance guidance and letter to pornography services (24 Apr 2025) \u2013 Ofcom reminded services that failure to have \u201chighly effective\u201d age checks by 25 July 2025 could lead to investigations \u201cwith the option of financial penalties\u201d (White & Case, 4 Aug 2025).\n\ne) Qualifying Worldwide Revenue (QWR) Fees & Penalties consultation (May 2026) and final policy statement (Sept 2026) \u2013 Ofcom set out in detail how both annual regulatory fees and the statutory penalty cap will be calculated: 10 % of QWR or \u00a318 m \u201cwhichever is higher.\u201d  The consultation clarifies that for group companies Ofcom may base the cap on group-wide global revenue.  Despite industry push-back, the policy was adopted largely unchanged (Pinsent Masons, 2 Oct 2026; Deloitte UK blog, \u201cDetermining the cost of online safety\u201d, 2026).\n\nf) Tariff Tables 2025/26 (published July 2025) \u2013 Ofcom budget for online-safety work rose to \u00a392 m and the document repeats that enforcement costs will ultimately be recovered from industry through fees and, where appropriate, \u201cmonetary penalties\u201d (Deloitte UK blog, 2026).\n\nKey themes emerging from these consultations / statements  \n\n\u2022  Size-based deterrence: All policy documents reiterate that penalties can be up to 10 % of QWR, signalling that very large global firms face multi-billion-pound exposure.  \n\u2022  Information duties are central: every completed OSA fine so far has arisen from failure to answer information notices; consultations stress that Ofcom cannot regulate effectively without timely, accurate data.  \n\u2022  Cooperation discounts: both the MintStars and OnlyFans VSP decisions apply a 30 % reduction for early admission, mirroring the draft OSA approach.  \n\u2022  Extra-territorial reach: the 4chan decision and QWR policy confirm Ofcom will enforce against foreign-based services where UK users are \u201csignificant.\u201d  \n\u2022  Progressive escalation: statements indicate Ofcom will normally issue information notices and engagement letters first, but will escalate to financial penalties if providers ignore or obstruct the regulator.  \n\n3. Information gaps  \n\nThe public material located almost certainly does not capture every VSP investigation between 2020-2023; Ofcom\u2019s website holds several 2021-2022 \u201cNo further action\u201d letters that are not returned in ordinary news searches.  Likewise, there may have been smaller OSA investigations in 2024 that ended without penalties.  To produce an absolutely exhaustive list the Ofcom \u201cEnforcement Bulletins\u201d and \u201cBroadcast and On-Demand Bulletin\u201d archive would need to be searched entry-by-entry.\n\n4. Conclusion  \n\nSince 2020 Ofcom has concluded at least six enforcement cases under either the VSP rules or the Online Safety Act, imposing monetary penalties in five of them totalling roughly \u00a34 million.  Although the headline statutory cap is very high, actual fines have so far been modest and mainly aimed at compelling cooperation and rapid compliance.  Ofcom\u2019s 2025-2026 consultations show an intention to scale enforcement rapidly, link penalties to global turnover, and recover its growing regulatory costs from industry\u2014suggesting the financial stakes for larger platforms will rise sharply as implementation of the OSA moves into its full \u201cPhase 3\u201d during 2026.</Agent_report>\n"
