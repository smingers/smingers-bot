Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary WHO/Official Sources:**

1. **Contagion Live (Feb 10, 2026)** - Published today. Reports WHO 2025 World Malaria Report documents 47 countries + 1 territory as malaria-free, with Egypt, Georgia, Suriname, and Timor-Leste as most recently certified. Medical news outlet citing official WHO report. **FACTUAL, HIGH QUALITY**.

2. **Egyptian Streets (Feb 9, 2026)** - Reports Egypt's Deputy Minister Amr Kandil won Nelson Mandela Health Award 2026, confirming Egypt was first African country to eliminate malaria. **FACTUAL confirmation of Egypt's certification status, HIGH QUALITY**.

3. **Cabo Verde/UN News (Feb 9, 2026)** - Reports Cabo Verde experienced malaria re-emergence after WHO certification but has had zero cases since December 2025. This confirms Cabo Verde was previously certified but faced challenges. **FACTUAL, MODERATE QUALITY** (shows certification doesn't guarantee permanent elimination).

4. **Suriname article (Oct 2, 2025)** - Reports Suriname declared malaria-free by PAHO/WHO in June 2025, first Amazon country to achieve this. Minister warns status remains vulnerable. **FACTUAL, HIGH QUALITY** - confirms Suriname's 2025 certification.

5. **WHO Report articles (Dec 4-5, 2025)** - Multiple sources report WHO 2025 World Malaria Report states 47 countries + 1 territory certified, with Cabo Verde and Egypt (2024), Georgia, Suriname, and Timor-Leste (2025). **FACTUAL, HIGH QUALITY** - consistent across multiple independent sources.

**Key Factual Findings:**
- As of December 2025: 47 countries + 1 territory certified
- 2025 certifications: Georgia (early 2025), Suriname (June 2025), Timor-Leste (2025)
- 2024 certifications: Egypt, Cabo Verde
- No sources mention any countries currently in final certification stages for early 2026

**Critical Gap:** None of the current news articles (Feb 2026 or late 2025) mention Bhutan, Malaysia, or Turkey being in imminent certification process. The outside view analysis referenced Bhutan as "on track...soon" from a December 2025 report, but this is not corroborated in the current news search.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Historical certification rate**: 1.55/year over 2015-2025 (17 certifications/11 years) - multiple WHO sources confirm this pattern. For 2.7-month window: ~0.35 expected certifications.
- **Q1 certification pattern**: 29% of historical certifications occurred Jan-March, confirmed by specific examples (Georgia Feb 2025, Cabo Verde Jan 2024, Azerbaijan/Tajikistan Mar 2023, El Salvador Feb 2021).

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Pipeline candidates from outside view**: Bhutan described as "on track...soon" in December 2025 report, Malaysia with 7 years zero cases, Turkey with submitted request. However, **CRITICAL LIMITATION**: These are not mentioned in any February 2026 news sources, suggesting no imminent announcement.

**Weak Evidence:**
- No current news (as of Feb 10, 2026) mentions any country in final certification stages
- No TAG-MEC meeting announcements for Q1 2026
- No WHO press releases about pending certifications

**Evidence Weight Adjustment:** The absence of any current news about pending certifications is significant negative evidence. If Bhutan, Malaysia, or Turkey were truly "soon" to be certified (as of Dec 2025), we would expect to see preparatory news, TAG-MEC meeting announcements, or country-level statements by February 2026.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window:** February 10 - May 1, 2026 = 80 days = 2.7 months = 22% of year

**If halved (1.35 months to ~March 10):** Probability would decrease to ~25-30%, as there's less time for TAG-MEC to meet and WHO to process certification.

**If doubled (5.4 months to ~July 15):** Probability would increase to ~50-55%, as this covers typical TAG-MEC meeting cycles and allows for mid-year certifications.

**Critical timing factors:**
- TAG-MEC typically meets once annually
- Certification decisions can take months after TAG-MEC recommendation
- 80 days is relatively short for bureaucratic processes
- However, Q1 certifications do occur (29% historical rate)

## (d) Justification

**Starting point:** Outside view base rate of 67% based on:
- 35% from annual rate (1.55/year × 0.22 year)
- +32% from pipeline candidates and Q1 patterns

**Major downward adjustments needed:**

1. **Absence of current news (-25%)**: No February 2026 sources mention pending certifications. If certification were imminent (within 80 days), we would expect:
   - TAG-MEC meeting announcements
   - Country-level press releases
   - WHO preliminary statements
   The complete absence of such news suggests no certification is in final stages.

2. **"Soon" language ambiguity (-10%)**: The December 2025 "on track...soon" language for Bhutan could mean 3-6 months or longer. "Soon" in WHO terminology often means "within the year," not necessarily Q1.

3. **Cabo Verde re-emergence concern (-5%)**: The news that Cabo Verde (certified 2024) experienced malaria re-emergence shows WHO may be more cautious about certifications, potentially slowing the process.

**Minor upward adjustment:**
4. **Q1 historical pattern (+5%)**: 29% of certifications occur Jan-March, slightly supporting possibility.

**Adjusted calculation:**
67% - 25% (no current news) - 10% (timing ambiguity) - 5% (increased caution) + 5% (Q1 pattern) = 32%

However, this still seems high given the complete absence of any news about pending certifications. The base rate should be weighted more heavily when specific evidence is lacking.

**Further calibration:** In 11 years, there were 3 years with zero certifications (27% of years). For a 2.7-month window with no supporting current news, the probability should be closer to the base rate without pipeline adjustments.

Pure base rate: 1.55/year × 0.22 year = 0.34 expected certifications ≈ 25-30% probability

## Probability Calibration

Starting from pure base rate of ~27% (accounting for Poisson distribution of rare events), with:
- Slight upward adjustment for Q1 pattern: +5%
- Slight downward adjustment for absence of current news: -5%
- Net adjustment: 0%

The absence of any February 2026 news about pending certifications is the most significant factor. While the outside view identified pipeline candidates, the lack of current corroboration suggests certifications are not imminent within the 80-day window.

**Final calibrated probability: 27%**

This reflects:
- Base rate expectation of ~0.34 certifications in 2.7 months
- Uncertainty about TAG-MEC timing
- Absence of supporting current evidence
- Historical pattern that some years have zero certifications

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will WHO certify at least one country/territory as malaria-free with certification year "2026" between Feb 10 - May 1, 2026 (80 days)?

2. **Base rate**: Outside view established 67% based on pipeline candidates. However, current news analysis reveals no supporting evidence for imminent certifications, warranting significant downward revision to ~27% (pure base rate).

3. **Consistency**: "27 out of 100 times, WHO certifies at least one country with year '2026' before May 1, 2026." This aligns with base rate of 1.55/year × 0.22 year ≈ 0.34 expected certifications, accounting for discrete probability.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Historical rate: 1.55 certifications/year (STRONG, FACTUAL)
   - Q1 pattern: 29% of certifications occur Jan-March (MODERATE, FACTUAL)
   - No current news of pending certifications as of Feb 10, 2026 (STRONG NEGATIVE)
   - Cabo Verde re-emergence suggests increased WHO caution (WEAK)
   - 80-day window is short for bureaucratic processes (MODERATE)

5. **Blind spot**: Bhutan, Malaysia, or Turkey could have quietly completed certification processes in January 2026, with announcement pending. TAG-MEC could have met in January without public announcement. This would increase probability to 50-60%.

6. **Status quo**: Current status quo is 47 countries + 1 territory certified. No certifications in first 40 days of 2026 (Jan 1 - Feb 10) suggests continued status quo is likely. 80 days is relatively short; world changes slowly. Status quo supports lower probability.

Probability: 27%
