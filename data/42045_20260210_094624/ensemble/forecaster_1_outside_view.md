Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis:**

1. **Contagion Live (Feb 10, 2026)** - This is today's date, making this a current source. It states the WHO 2025 World Malaria Report recognizes 47 countries and one territory as malaria-free, with Egypt, Georgia, Suriname, and Timor-Leste as the most recently certified. This is a medical news outlet reporting on an official WHO report. The factual content (certification numbers and countries) is reliable as it directly references WHO data.

2. **WIPO Blog (undated, references Jan 21, 2025)** - Reports Georgia's certification on January 21, 2025. Provides background on certification requirements (three consecutive years without indigenous transmission). As an IP-focused organization discussing health innovation, this is a credible secondary source for factual certification information.

3. **Statista (April 24, 2025)** - Reports 45 countries + 1 territory certified as of January 2025, with Georgia as the latest in 2025, Egypt and Cape Verde in 2024. Statista is a reliable data aggregator. The slight discrepancy with the Contagion Live figure (45 vs 47) is explained by timing - Statista's data is from January 2025, while Contagion Live references the full 2025 report (likely including Suriname and Timor-Leste certified later in 2025).

4. **Africa Renewal (April 30, 2025)** - Reports 44 countries + 1 territory as of October 2024 when Egypt was certified. UN publication, highly credible for factual WHO certification data.

5. **Agent Report** - Provides comprehensive historical data showing 17 certifications from 2015-2025 (11 years), averaging 1.55 certifications per year. Identifies Bhutan and Malaysia as countries "on track" for certification, with Bhutan having sustained zero indigenous cases for three consecutive years and Malaysia for seven years. Notes Georgia and Turkey submitted certification requests. The agent's methodology is transparent and data is cross-referenced with WHO sources.

**Key Facts Established:**
- As of Feb 10, 2026: 47 countries + 1 territory certified
- Recent 2025 certifications: Georgia (Jan/Feb), Timor-Leste (July), Suriname (July)
- Historical rate: 1.55 certifications/year (2015-2025)
- Pipeline candidates: Bhutan (described as "on track...soon"), Malaysia (7 years zero cases), possibly Turkey

(b) **Reference Class Analysis:**

**Reference Class 1: Annual WHO malaria-free certifications (2015-2025)**
- 17 certifications over 11 years = 1.55/year average
- Distribution: Some years had 0 (2017, 2020, 2022), some had 2-3 (2016, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2023, 2024, 2025)
- Suitability: HIGH - This is the most direct reference class, measuring exactly what we're forecasting

**Reference Class 2: Certifications in partial years (Jan-Apr timeframe)**
- Looking at timing: Several certifications occurred in Q1-Q2 (El Salvador Feb 2021, Cabo Verde Jan 2024, Azerbaijan/Tajikistan Mar 2023, Georgia Feb 2025)
- Suitability: MODERATE - Relevant for timing but smaller sample size

**Reference Class 3: Countries in certification pipeline**
- Agent report identifies Bhutan as "on track...soon" with required 3 years complete
- Malaysia has 7 years of zero cases (well beyond the 3-year requirement)
- Turkey submitted request per 2024 report
- Suitability: HIGH - These are concrete candidates that could certify in our timeframe

**Selected Reference Class:** Combination of annual certification rate (1.55/year) and specific pipeline candidates (Bhutan, Malaysia, Turkey)

(c) **Timeframe Analysis:**

- **Prediction window:** February 10, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = 80 days = 2.7 months = 22% of a year
- **Historical patterns for similar periods:**
  - In 2025: Georgia certified in Jan/Feb (early year)
  - In 2024: Cabo Verde certified in January (early year)
  - In 2023: Azerbaijan/Tajikistan certified in March (Q1)
  - In 2021: El Salvador certified in February (Q1)
  
**Early-year certification pattern:** 5 of 17 certifications (29%) occurred in Jan-March period, suggesting WHO does issue certifications in Q1.

- **Relevant timing factors:**
  - TAG-MEC typically meets once annually
  - WHO Director-General makes decisions same or following calendar year
  - World Malaria Report 2025 (released Dec 2025) identified Bhutan as "on track...soon"
  - This language suggests imminent certification, possibly Q1 2026

(d) **Justification:**

The question asks whether at least one additional country will be certified with certification year "2026" before May 1, 2026.

**Supporting factors for YES:**
1. Historical base rate: 1.55 certifications/year means ~0.35 certifications expected in a 2.7-month period (22% of year)
2. Pipeline candidates exist: Bhutan explicitly described as "on track...soon" in Dec 2025 report, suggesting imminent certification
3. Malaysia has exceeded requirements by 4+ years (7 years zero cases vs. 3 required)
4. Turkey submitted certification request per 2024 report
5. Early-year certifications are common: 29% of historical certifications occurred Jan-March
6. WHO 2025 report language ("soon") typically precedes certification within months
7. Three years had 2+ certifications, showing capacity for multiple decisions per year

**Factors for NO:**
1. Some years had zero certifications (2017, 2020, 2022)
2. Certification process is rigorous and can face delays
3. Only 2.7 months in prediction window
4. No explicit announcement of pending certification decision
5. TAG-MEC meeting schedule unknown for early 2026

**Critical consideration:** The phrase "on track...soon" for Bhutan in the December 2025 report is a strong signal. WHO typically doesn't use such language unless certification is imminent. Combined with the historical pattern of Q1 certifications and the existence of multiple qualified candidates, the probability of at least one certification before May 1 is substantial.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate of 1.55 certifications/year translates to roughly 35% probability for our 2.7-month window if certifications were evenly distributed. However, several factors adjust this:

**Upward adjustments:**
- Specific pipeline candidate (Bhutan) with "soon" language: +20-25%
- Historical Q1 certification pattern (29% of certifications): +10%
- Multiple candidates (Malaysia, Turkey) providing redundancy: +10%

**Downward adjustments:**
- Uncertainty about TAG-MEC meeting timing: -5%
- Some years had zero certifications (risk of administrative delays): -5%

Starting from 35% base rate:
35% + 25% (Bhutan signal) + 10% (Q1 pattern) + 10% (multiple candidates) - 5% (timing uncertainty) - 5% (delay risk) = 70%

However, I should be cautious about overconfidence. The "soon" language is strong but not a guarantee. Historical upset rate in WHO certifications appears low (process is methodical), but timing can slip.

Calibrating to account for remaining uncertainty about exact TAG-MEC schedule and potential administrative delays, while heavily weighting the "on track...soon" signal for Bhutan:

Outside View Prediction:
