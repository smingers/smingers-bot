Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary WHO-related sources:**
1. **Contagion Live (Feb 10, 2026)** - Reports 47 countries + 1 territory certified, with Egypt, Georgia, Suriname, and Timor-Leste as most recent additions documented in WHO 2025 World Malaria Report. High quality, factual, current date matches question opening.

2. **Egyptian Streets (Feb 9, 2026)** - Announces Egypt's deputy health minister won Nelson Mandela Health Award 2026, noting Egypt became "first African country to eliminate malaria." Factual regarding Egypt's certification but doesn't specify timing. Moderate quality.

3. **Multiple sources (Dec 4-5, 2025)** - WHO World Malaria Report 2025 coverage confirming: "47 countries and one territory have been certified malaria-free" with Cabo Verde and Egypt in 2024, Georgia, Suriname, and Timor-Leste in 2025. High quality, consistent across multiple outlets.

4. **Statista (Apr 24, 2025)** - Confirms Georgia as latest certification in 2025, with 45 countries + 1 territory total as of January 2025. Good quality baseline.

5. **Suriname article (Oct 2, 2025)** - Confirms Suriname received certification in June 2025 from PAHO/WHO. Minister warns status remains vulnerable. High quality, specific timing.

6. **Cabo Verde article (Feb 9, 2026)** - Notes Cabo Verde had "recent re-emergence of cases after receiving WHO's eradication certification" but reports zero cases since December. This indicates Cabo Verde was certified in 2024 but experienced setback. Moderate quality.

**Key factual findings:**
- As of Feb 10, 2026: 47 countries + 1 territory certified
- 2024 certifications: Egypt (Oct), Cabo Verde
- 2025 certifications: Georgia (Jan), Suriname (June), Timor-Leste
- No announcements of 2026 certifications yet
- No specific mentions of countries in active certification pipeline for early 2026

**Expert opinions identified:**
- WHO Director-General Tedros (multiple sources): Emphasizes challenges (drug resistance, funding cuts) but maintains "malaria-free world remains achievable with leadership and investment." This is cautiously optimistic but doesn't predict specific 2026 certifications.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence (against near-term certification):**
- Multiple independent sources confirm the current count is 47+1 as of Feb 10, 2026, with no 2026 certifications announced yet
- The 3-year consecutive zero-case requirement means any 2026 certification would need countries that achieved elimination by early 2023
- Historical pattern shows certifications cluster in Jan-Mar or mid-year, but we're already at Feb 10 with none announced

**Moderate evidence (mixed signals):**
- Outside view analysis noted Bhutan and Malaysia as potential pipeline candidates, but no current sources mention imminent certifications for these countries
- Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam noted as "nearing elimination" in Greater Mekong Subregion, but "nearing" doesn't indicate 2026 timeline
- Cabo Verde's re-emergence of cases (though now zero since December) suggests even certified countries face challenges

**Weak evidence:**
- General statements about "progress" and new tools don't translate to specific certification timelines
- No TAG-MEC meeting announcements or certification applications mentioned in current sources

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 80 days (Feb 10 - May 1, 2026)

**If halved to 40 days (mid-March):** Probability would drop significantly to ~15-20%. TAG-MEC typically needs time to review applications, and no applications are publicly mentioned. A 40-day window would require a certification already in final approval stages.

**If doubled to 160 days (mid-July):** Probability would increase to ~55-60%, as this would capture the typical mid-year certification cluster and allow time for TAG-MEC meetings that may already be scheduled.

**Critical timing consideration:** We're already 10 days into 2026 with no announcements. Historically, when Jan-Mar certifications occur, they're often announced in January or early February. The silence so far is a negative signal.

## (d) Justification

**Factors supporting lower probability than 37% base rate:**

1. **Temporal disadvantage:** We're 1/8th through the resolution window with no announcements. Historical pattern shows early-year certifications typically announced by now.

2. **No pipeline visibility:** Unlike the outside view's mention of Bhutan/Malaysia as potential candidates, current sources provide zero indication of countries in active certification process for 2026.

3. **Recent certification cluster exhaustion:** Five certifications in 2024-2025 (Egypt, Cabo Verde, Georgia, Suriname, Timor-Leste) may have cleared the immediate pipeline of ready candidates.

4. **Process requirements:** The 3-year requirement plus government application plus TAG-MEC review means countries certifiable in early 2026 would need to have completed their zero-case period by early 2023 and already be in the application process.

**Factors supporting higher probability:**

1. **Historical precedent:** 5 of last 7 years had early-year certifications, suggesting institutional momentum.

2. **TAG-MEC schedule:** If a meeting is scheduled for late February or March (not mentioned in sources but possible), certifications could still occur before May 1.

3. **Reporting lag:** Certification might occur but not be immediately reflected on the WHO webpage.

**Net assessment:** The lack of any current indication of pending certifications, combined with being 10 days into the window with no announcements, justifies a downward adjustment from the 37% base rate. However, the strong historical pattern of early-year certifications prevents dropping too low.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view base rate: 37%

**Adjustments:**
- Down 10 percentage points: No current evidence of pending certifications, already 10 days into window with silence
- Down 5 percentage points: Recent cluster (2024-2025) likely cleared immediate pipeline
- Up 3 percentage points: Reporting lags and unannounced TAG-MEC meetings remain possible

**Final calibration: 25%**

This reflects that while the historical pattern supports early-year certifications, the complete absence of current indicators and the temporal disadvantage make it more likely than not that no certification will occur before May 1, 2026.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will WHO's malaria-free certification page show at least one new country/territory with 2026 certification year before May 1, 2026? (80-day window)

2. **Base rate:** 37% from outside view (5 of 11 recent years had Jan-Apr certifications). My 25% prediction represents a 12-point downward adjustment justified by lack of current pipeline evidence and temporal disadvantage.

3. **Consistency:** "25 out of 100 times, at least one country receives WHO malaria-free certification and it's published on the WHO page before May 1, 2026." This aligns with my assessment that historical patterns support possibility but current evidence suggests lower likelihood.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - 47+1 countries certified as of Feb 10, 2026; no 2026 certifications announced yet (factual, verified across multiple sources)
   - Five certifications occurred in 2024-2025, potentially clearing immediate pipeline (factual, verified)
   - No current sources mention countries in active certification process for early 2026 (absence of evidence, verified by source review)
   - Historical pattern: 5 of last 7 years had early certifications, but we're already 10 days in (factual pattern, verified)

5. **Blind spot:** A TAG-MEC meeting scheduled for late February or early March with one or more countries already in final review stages would make my forecast look too pessimistic. This could occur if the certification process is further along than public sources indicate. This scenario might warrant 35-40% instead.

6. **Status quo:** Status quo is "no 2026 certifications yet." Given low volatility in certification timing and the 10-day silence, a slight nudge toward status quo (no certification) is appropriate, supporting my 25% rather than staying at 37%.

Probability: 25%
