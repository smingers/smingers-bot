Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis:**

**Source 1: Contagion Live (Feb 10, 2026)** - This is today's date, making it the most current source. It reports that the WHO 2025 World Malaria Report recognizes 47 countries and one territory as malaria-free, with Egypt, Georgia, Suriname, and Timor-Leste as the most recently certified. This is a medical news outlet; the factual claims about WHO certifications are verifiable against WHO sources. Quality: Medium-high for factual reporting.

**Source 2: WIPO Blog (date unclear, references Georgia's Jan 21, 2025 certification)** - Discusses Georgia's certification and broader malaria trends. The blog format suggests this is opinion/analysis mixed with facts. The Georgia certification date (Jan 21, 2025) is factual. Quality: Medium for facts, lower for predictive claims.

**Source 3: Statista (Apr 24, 2025)** - Reports 45 countries + 1 territory certified as of January 2025, with Georgia as the latest. This is a data aggregation site with good reputation for accuracy. Quality: High for factual data.

**Source 4: Africa Renewal UN (Apr 30, 2025)** - Reports Egypt certified in October 2024, bringing global total to 44 countries + 1 territory. This is an official UN publication. Quality: High for factual reporting.

**Source 5: Agent Report** - Provides comprehensive historical data showing 17 certifications from 2015-2025 (11 years), averaging 1.55 per year. Lists specific dates and identifies Bhutan and Malaysia as countries "on track" for certification. The agent notes Georgia and Turkey submitted requests, and Bhutan is described as "on track...soon" in the 2025 World Malaria Report. Quality: High for historical aggregation, though some dates are inferred.

**Reconciling the sources:** The progression is clear:
- As of Jan 2025: 45 countries + 1 territory (Statista)
- Georgia certified: Early 2025 (bringing total to 46+1)
- Suriname and Timor-Leste certified: Mid-2025 (bringing total to 47+1, per Feb 2026 Contagion article)

(b) **Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **Annual WHO malaria-free certifications (2015-2025):** 17 certifications over 11 years = 1.55/year average
2. **Recent certifications (2023-2025):** 7 certifications over 3 years = 2.33/year
3. **Certifications within first 4 months of calendar year:** Need to examine historical timing
4. **Countries in the certification pipeline:** Bhutan and Malaysia explicitly mentioned as "on track"

**Suitability evaluation:**
- Reference class #1 provides the longest baseline but may underweight recent acceleration
- Reference class #2 captures recent momentum (2023: 3 certifications, 2024: 2, 2025: 3 through July)
- Reference class #4 is most specific to the question but depends on WHO's opaque decision timeline

**Most suitable:** A combination of #1 (base rate) and #4 (specific pipeline information).

(c) **Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction window:** February 10, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = 80 days = 2.7 months

**Historical timing patterns from Agent Report:**
- 2015: 1 (Sep)
- 2016: 2 (Jul, Sep)
- 2017: 0
- 2018: 2 (Feb, Jun)
- 2019: 2 (May, May)
- 2020: 0
- 2021: 2 (Feb, Jun)
- 2022: 0
- 2023: 3 (Mar, Mar, Jun)
- 2024: 2 (Jan, Dec)
- 2025: 3 (Feb, Jul, Jul)

**Certifications in Jan-Apr period historically:**
- 2018: 1 (Feb)
- 2021: 1 (Feb)
- 2023: 2 (Mar)
- 2024: 1 (Jan)
- 2025: 1 (Feb)

In the last 8 years, there were 6 certifications during Jan-Apr, or 0.75 per year during this period.

**Key insight:** The question asks specifically about certifications with year "2026" on the WHO page. Since we're only 80 days into 2026, we need the probability of at least one certification in the first ~4 months of the year.

(d) **Justification:**

**Factors supporting a Yes outcome:**
1. **Pipeline candidates:** The 2025 World Malaria Report explicitly states Bhutan is "on track to achieving malaria-free certification soon" with three consecutive years of zero cases. Malaysia has seven consecutive years of zero cases.
2. **Recent acceleration:** 2023-2025 saw higher certification rates (2.33/year) than the long-term average (1.55/year)
3. **Historical Jan-Apr pattern:** 6 certifications in Jan-Apr over the past 8 years suggests ~0.75 probability for this period
4. **TAG-MEC cycle:** The Agent Report notes TAG-MEC meets annually, and countries that submitted in 2024 (Georgia, Turkey per the 2024 report) would likely receive decisions in 2025-2026

**Factors against a Yes outcome:**
1. **Already certified in 2025:** Georgia, Suriname, and Timor-Leste were certified in 2025, potentially reducing the immediate pipeline
2. **Bureaucratic timing:** WHO certification requires extensive review; even "on track" countries may face delays
3. **Short window:** Only 80 days for a process that typically takes months after dossier submission
4. **No confirmed 2026 certifications yet:** As of Feb 10, 2026, no 2026 certifications have been announced

**Critical consideration:** The question resolves based on what appears on the WHO page with certification year "2026". Bhutan appears to be the strongest candidate given the explicit "on track...soon" language in the Dec 2025 report.

Outside view calibration:

**Base rate anchoring:** 
- Historical Jan-Apr certification rate: 6 out of 8 years = 75%
- But this is for "any certification in Jan-Apr," not specifically year-labeled certifications

**Pipeline-specific adjustment:**
- Bhutan is explicitly described as ready for certification "soon" as of Dec 2025
- Malaysia has 7 years of zero cases but no explicit "soon" language
- The timing from "on track soon" (Dec 2025) to actual certification could easily span into early 2026

**Uncertainty factors:**
- WHO's internal timeline is opaque
- "Soon" is vague and could mean Q1 2026 or later in the year
- The 80-day window captures only ~22% of 2026

**Calibration reasoning:**
Given that Bhutan is explicitly on track with the language suggesting imminent certification, and historical patterns show certifications do occur in Jan-Apr (~75% of years), but considering the short 80-day window and bureaucratic uncertainties, I estimate:

- Probability Bhutan gets certified with "2026" label by May 1: ~45%
- Probability Malaysia or another country gets certified: ~15%
- Overlap/both: ~5%
- At least one: ~55%

However, the "soon" language in a December 2025 report for Bhutan, combined with the historical pattern of Feb/Mar certifications (2021, 2023, 2025), suggests the probability should be somewhat higher.
