Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / resolution alignment
This resolves **Yes** if **between Feb 10, 2026 and before May 1, 2026**, the WHO “Countries and territories certified malaria-free by WHO” page is updated to show **at least one new entry with certification year “2026”** that was not on the page at question open.

(a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; date)
- WHO certification process page (WHO; undated/standing guidance): Describes formal criteria (≥3 consecutive years zero indigenous cases; strong surveillance; certification on government request; TAG-MEC advisory). High credibility for process; no timing signals.
- WHO malaria elimination page (WHO; background; as of Jan 2025 counts): General status and governance (TAG-MEC). High credibility, but not about imminent 2026 certifications.
- WHO news release “New tools saved…” (who.int; Dec 4, 2025): Summarizes World Malaria Report 2025 context; mentions certified totals and recent certifications (Cabo Verde/Egypt 2024; Georgia/Suriname/Timor-Leste 2025 per some pick-ups). High credibility; still implies latest certifications were in 2025.
- Contagion Live (Feb 10, 2026): Reports that WHO recognizes 47 countries and one territory as malaria-free; “most recently certified” Egypt, Georgia, Suriname, Timor-Leste (as documented in World Malaria Report 2025). Medium-high as secondary reporting; importantly, it does **not** indicate any **2026** certification already occurred.
- Statista infographic (Apr 24, 2025): Aggregates WHO certification history; says Georgia latest in 2025; Egypt & Cabo Verde in 2024. Medium-high for compilation; not a primary source.
- ISID blog (Apr 25, 2025) and Vax-Before-Travel (Apr 28, 2025): General malaria burden + counts; no pipeline/timing. Medium/medium-low relevance.
- AskNews: Cabo Verde health-plan piece (Feb 9, 2026): Mentions Cabo Verde had malaria eradication certification but had re-emergence; relevant as general fragility, not directly about new 2026 certifications. Medium; local-language reporting.
- AskNews: Multiple outlets repeating World Malaria Report themes (Dec 2025) + Egypt award articles (Feb 8–9, 2026): Reinforce that Egypt’s malaria-free certification is an already-accomplished milestone; no forward-looking 2026 candidate named. Medium relevance.

Bottom line from sources: We have strong confirmation of the *process* and that the *most recent certifications cited in widely circulated reporting are 2024–2025*, with **no explicit indication** that WHO has already certified anyone in **2026**, nor clear reporting of a government request currently at the “imminent decision” stage.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution criteria)
Strong evidence
- Structural/timing constraint: WHO certification requires (i) ≥3 years zero indigenous transmission, (ii) a government request, (iii) WHO/TAG-MEC review, then publication/update. This multi-step process makes “within 80 days” non-trivial unless dossiers are already essentially complete. (WHO process page)
- Current status implied by multiple sources: Recent certifications are still being referred to as 2024–2025 (no mention of a 2026 certification as of Feb 10, 2026). This is not definitive, but it is a strong “nothing has happened yet” signal at question open. (WHO/secondary reporting)

Moderate evidence
- Historical clustering: Certifications sometimes occur in early-year months (Jan–Mar shows up in multiple years in the outside-view history). This supports non-zero chance of a Q1/Q2 update. (Outside-view timing pattern; Statista/compiled histories)
- Event-driven communications: WHO and partners often message around milestones (e.g., World Malaria Day, late April). This could increase odds of an update before May 1 if a certification is ready. (General comms pattern; indirect)

Weak evidence
- Cabo Verde “re-emergence” mention: suggests certification can be followed by flare-ups, but does not predict *new* certifications before May 1. (AskNews Cabo Verde)
- General “countries nearing elimination” statements in media: plausible but too non-specific to forecast a 2026 certification within this narrow window.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time remaining: ~80 days (Feb 10 → May 1, 2026).
- If the timeframe were halved (~40 days): I’d drop materially because only already-finalized dossiers would make it—probability would fall by ~10–15 points.
- If doubled (~160 days, into mid-July 2026): I’d raise meaningfully because you’d capture more of the year’s typical certification cadence—probability would rise by ~15–25 points.

(d) Justification (inside view vs outside view)
Outside view base rate was 58%, largely driven by (i) historical early-year certifications and (ii) presumed pipeline candidates.
Inside view adjustments:
- Downward: As of Feb 10, 2026, credible summaries still characterize the “most recently certified” as 2024–2025 countries, with **no concrete named candidate** reported as “submitted dossier / under review / decision imminent” for 2026 *and* no hint that WHO has already made a 2026 determination that just awaits webpage update. Given the bureaucratic nature of certification and the short window, the absence of “imminent decision” signals is meaningful.
- Slight upward offset: Certifications are sometimes announced early in the year, and April communications (World Malaria Day) could plausibly be used to publish an update—*if* a dossier is ready.

Net: I move the probability **down from 58% to the low-40s**, mainly because the window ends before likely major moments like the World Health Assembly in May, and because I lack specific pipeline-confirmation that a 2026 certification is queued for publication in Feb–Apr.

Probability calibration
- Status quo if nothing changes: WHO page remains with latest certification year = 2025; no “2026” entry appears before May 1 → No.
- Key “Yes” path: at least one country has already met criteria, has requested certification, is reviewed/approved, and WHO updates the page with year “2026” by late April.
- Key “No” paths: (i) approvals happen after May 1; (ii) reviews slip; (iii) approvals occur but page update lags beyond May 1; (iv) no country requests/clears certification in this window.

Inside-view probability: I judge “at least one 2026-labeled certification posted by May 1” as **somewhat less likely than not**, but far from rare.

Checklist:
1. Criteria/time window check: Need WHO page to show ≥1 *new* entry with certification year “2026” between Feb 10 and before May 1, 2026.
2. Outside view base rate: 58%.
3. Consistency line: “42 out of 100 times, WHO’s certified-malaria-free page gains a new ‘2026’ entry before May 1, 2026.”
4. Top evidence (3–5):
   - Multi-step certification process + short (80-day) window (WHO).
   - As of Feb 10, reporting still frames latest certifications as 2024–2025; no 2026 mention yet.
   - Historical early-year certifications occur, but not reliably every year.
   - Potential comms hook (late April) could accelerate publication if a decision is ready.
5. Blind spot: A near-complete dossier (e.g., a small country/territory) could be approved and posted quietly in March/April with little prior media signal—this would push probability upward.
6. Status quo nudge: With no explicit imminent candidate in current reporting, lean toward “No” within this narrow window.

Probability: 42%
