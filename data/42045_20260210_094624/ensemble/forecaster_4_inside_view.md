Analysis:
1. Source analysis  
a. Contagion Live (10 Feb 2026).  Secondary journalism summarising WHO 2025 World Malaria Report.  Factual data: 47 countries + 1 territory certified; latest = Egypt, Georgia, Suriname, Timor-Leste.  No 2026 certifications yet.  Reliable enough for counts; not primary for timing.  
b. WHO certification-process page (undated, maintained 2025).  Primary source on criteria & governance; establishes structural lead-time (≥3 yrs zero transmission; government request; TAG-MEC review).  
c. Statista infographic (24 Apr 2025).  Tertiary; corroborates 45 + 1 tally and recent dates.  
d. ISID World Malaria Day blog (25 Apr 2025).  NGO blog; confirms Timor-Leste & Saudi Arabia hit zero indigenous-case mark but not yet certified – useful pipeline clue, moderate quality.  
e. AskNews sweep (Feb 8-10 2026).  No article announces an imminent certification; Cabo Verde piece even notes vigilance after earlier certification.  Absence of “pre-announcement” signals is weak negative evidence.

2. Evidence analysis (relative to Yes before 1 May 2026)  
Strong evidence  
– Historical pattern: 3 of the last 11 years (27 %) saw a certification announced between 10 Feb and 30 Apr.  
– Institutional cadence: TAG-MEC has repeatedly met in February (2018, 2021, 2023, 2025) and certifications often follow immediately, implying a structural window now.

Moderate evidence  
– Pipeline countries: Saudi Arabia (zero cases ≥2023), Belize, perhaps Lao PDR or Vietnam, are publicly described as near-elimination; any one could already have dossiers at WHO.  
– No 2026 certifications yet, so the first addition of the calendar year could plausibly occur early (as in 2018, 2021, 2025).

Weak evidence  
– No leaks or local-press hints (which preceded Georgia 2025) detected as of 10 Feb 2026.  
– Budget/focus concerns and WHO workload could delay decisions, but effect size on elimination-stage files is uncertain.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window = 80 days (~0.22 y).  Halving (40 days) would cut probability roughly in half because decisions usually cluster near TAG meetings; doubling (160 days) would raise probability markedly (to around 45-50 %) as another seasonal meeting would be included.

4. Justification and adjustment from outside view  
Outside-view base rate (Poisson using 1.55 certs/yr) gave P≈25 %.  
Upward pressures: predictable February TAG meeting; several plausible applicants already at zero cases.  
Downward pressures: four certifications just occurred in 2024-25, potentially thinning the near-term queue; complete lack of early-Feb rumours; WHO bandwidth issues.  
Net: slight downward revision to 22 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that in 22 out of 100 comparable cases the WHO webpage will show at least one new “2026” certification before 1 May 2026.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Between 10 Feb and 1 May 2026, will the WHO page list any country/territory with certification year 2026?”  
2. Base rate = 25 %.  
3. Consistency – “22/100 times, Yes happens.” ✔  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each)  
   – TAG-MEC often meets in February → quick announcements.  
   – 27 % historical Yes in same window.  
   – Saudi Arabia & Belize reportedly fulfil zero-case criterion.  
   – No 2026 certifications or media hints as of today.  
5. Blind-spot – Quiet fast-track of one small Pacific island already qualified could appear without press leaks, lifting actual probability.  
6. Status-quo – Doing nothing usually means page unchanged (No).

Probability: 22%
