Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Contagion Live, 10 Feb 2026 – trade‐press recap of the 2025 WHO World Malaria Report.  Factual information: 47 countries/1 territory certified to date; most recent additions are Egypt, Georgia, Suriname, Timor-Leste.  No obvious opinion other than a general warning about resistance.  Quality: good for factual tally but still secondary to the WHO register.  
2. WIPO blog, undated excerpt posted 2025 – notes Georgia’s Jan 2025 certification and provides historical anecdotes.  Useful for month of certification; otherwise mostly commentary.  Secondary quality.  
3. Statista infographic, 24 Apr 2025 – draws from WHO data to list certifications up to Georgia (2025).  Good for cross-checking counts and months; secondary source.  
4. AfricaRenewal article, 30 Apr 2025 – confirms Egypt’s Oct 2024 certification and total to that point (44 + 1).  Also contains regional burden data (opinionated narrative).  Moderate quality.  
5. Contagion Live duplicate (same as #1).  
6. Agent report – compiled list of every WHO certification 2015-2025 with months, and gives average annual rate (1.55).  Provides WHO pipeline hints (Bhutan, Malaysia) but flags that these are not tied to firm decision dates.  Well sourced but still a secondary synthesis; some month stamps are inferred (*).  Overall the best compact quantitative base-rate dataset but requires healthy scepticism for the starred dates.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Possible reference classes:  
1. Annual frequency of WHO malaria-free certifications (2015-2025) – 17 certifications in 11 years → 1.55 certifications/year.  
2. Probability that at least one certification occurs in the first four months of any year (Jan-Apr) – happened in 5 of the last 11 years (2018, 2021, 2023, 2024, 2025) → 45%.  
3. Poisson process assumption using the average annual rate and a 0.225-year window (80 days/365) → λ ≈ 1.55 × 0.225 ≈ 0.35; P(≥1) = 1 – e^(–0.35) ≈ 30%.  

Suitability: #2 directly matches the event definition (a certification posted by 1 May) and implicitly captures WHO’s internal calendar (TAG-MEC often meets late Jan/Feb or Jul). I adopt reference class #2 but will keep #3 as a cross-check.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time until resolution: 80 days (~2.6 months).  
Historical pattern: Since the modern certification procedure was introduced (post-2015), roughly one-third (6/17) of all certifications have been announced in Jan-Mar. Five of the last seven calendar years have seen at least one certification by 1 May. Therefore early-year certifications are not rare but also far from guaranteed.  

(d) Justification / outside-view synthesis  
• Baseline probability from reference class #2 = 45%.  
• Check against Poisson approximation (#3) = 30% (lower because it spreads decisions uniformly, which empirical data contradict).  
• Historical “upset” rate (years with zero early-year certifications even though some certifications happened later) = 4/7 in certification-active years, indicating moderate volatility.  
• Certification decisions require a dossier and TAG-MEC/Director-General sign-off; that process can slip but, when approvals come, they often cluster in Jan-Mar or Jul. Hence the uniform-time assumption in the Poisson model is too conservative; 45% is the better anchor.  
• Because the outside view deliberately ignores any 2026 pipeline intelligence, I refrain from adjusting for reports that Bhutan or Malaysia may be close; that belongs in the inside view.  
• I apply a modest shrinkage toward long-run uncertainty (mean of 45% and 30% ≈ 37%) to reflect data limitations (some month stamps inferred, only 11-year window).  

Outside view calibration:  
Anchor = 45%  
Down-adjust 8 percentage points for uncertainty in month dating, small-N noise, and the possibility that TAG-MEC meets later in 2026 → 37%.  
Round only to the nearest tenth of a percent for clarity.
