Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Contagion Live, 10 Feb 2026 – Secondary but factual write-up of WHO 2025 World Malaria Report; confirms 47 countries + 1 territory certified, latest being Egypt, Georgia, Suriname, Timor-Leste. High-quality, dated today.  
2. WHO “Countries and territories certified malaria-free” page (baseline list captured at question open) – Primary, definitive for resolution.  
3. Statista infographic, 24 Apr 2025 – Good secondary source for historic counts; no forward claims.  
4. ISID World Malaria Day 2025 article, 25 Apr 2025 – Lists 45 + 1 certifications, notes Timor-Leste & Saudi Arabia with 3 yrs zero cases (but not yet certified). Moderate quality.  
5. WHO/PAHO press release, Jun 2025 – Primary confirmation of Suriname certification. High quality.  
6. AskNews clipping within Contagion Live piece – Quotes WHO that Cambodia, Lao PDR and Viet Nam are “nearing elimination”. Single secondary mention; forward-looking; moderate quality.  
No other AskNews articles provide new pipeline information.

Factual content is separated above; opinions (e.g., “progress dramatic”) are noted but not used.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Historical pattern: in 2015-2025 WHO certified ≥1 country in this exact 10 Feb-1 May window 3 out of 11 years (27 %).  
• WHO rule: 3 consecutive years zero indigenous cases is mandatory – structural, slow-moving.  

Moderate evidence  
• Recent cadence: 5 certifications in 2024-2025 (above long-run mean 1.55/yr) shows active WHO machinery and a stocked pipeline.  
• Statement that Cambodia, Lao PDR, Viet Nam are “nearing elimination” suggests at least one dossier may already be with TAG-MEC.  

Weak evidence  
• Timor-Leste & Saudi Arabia had 3 yrs zero cases by 2025 but only Timor-Leste went on to certification – demonstrates passage from “eligible” to “certified” is uncertain.  
• No public TAG-MEC meeting dates for early 2026 have been released.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time until resolution: 81 days ≈ 0.22 yr.  
If the window were doubled to six months, probability would roughly double (to the low-50 % range) because June/July announcements are common. If halved to 40 days, chance would drop to ~15 %.  

(d) Justification / Inside-view adjustments  
Outside-view base rate (Poisson & empirical) = 26 %.  
Adjustments:  
–1 pp  Back-to-back heavy certification years may have thinned the queue.  
+2 pp  Evidence of at least three GMS countries at “nearing elimination” stage implies some dossiers likely mature.  
–2 pp  Very short 81-day window; announcements require DG sign-off & media package.  
Net adjustment: −1 pp → 25 %.

Status-quo outcome if nothing changes: “No” (no new certification) because list currently stands at 47 + 1 with none dated 2026.

Probability calibration
I expect that in 25 out of 100 comparable 81-day windows the WHO will add at least one country/territory with certification year 2026 to its malaria-free list.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – Between now and 1 May 2026, will WHO’s certified-malaria-free web list gain any entry dated 2026?  
2. Outside-view base rate stated 26 %; final built from it.  
3. Consistency line above.  
4. Key evidence (≤20 w each):  
   • 27 % historical success rate in identical calendar window.  
   • Five certifications 2024-25 show active pipeline.  
   • WHO note: Cambodia, Laos, Vietnam “nearing elimination”.  
   • 81-day window—process logistics limit approvals.  
5. Blind-spot: Saudi Arabia quietly completed dossier; TAG-MEC meets in March and certifies two Gulf states, pushing actual probability far higher.  
6. Status-quo outcome is “No”, nudging forecast slightly toward lower probabilities.

Probability: 25%
