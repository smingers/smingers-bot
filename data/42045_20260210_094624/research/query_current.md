Analysis:
The key is whether WHO has already (between the question open date and today, 10 Feb 2026) announced that a new country/territory has been certified malaria-free—or whether such an announcement may still occur before 1 May 2026. So we need the very latest WHO press releases, regional health-ministry statements, and global-health journalism about (a) any 2026 certification already granted, or (b) candidate countries on the verge of receiving certification. Useful terms include “WHO”, “malaria-free”, “certified”, “2026”, plus names of likely contenders (Belize, Malaysia, Bhutan, Timor-Leste, Azerbaijan, Tajikistan, etc.). The most authoritative confirmation would be a WHO “certification malaria-free” press release; however, signals could also come from news outlets reporting on an imminent WHO decision. Therefore queries should capture both definite certifications and near-term prospects.
