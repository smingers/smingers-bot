Analysis:
To judge the odds of a new certification before 1 May 2026 we need the historical tempo of WHO malaria-free announcements (how many per year and in which months) and which countries are presently in the certification “pipeline.”  Useful context includes: 1) the list of countries already certified and announcement dates (e.g., Cabo Verde 2024, China 2021, El Salvador–Algeria 2021, etc.); 2) WHO statements or national press releases that a country has applied for, or is close to completing, certification (Belize, Bhutan, Timor-Leste, Malaysia, etc.); 3) recent news in 2025-26 hinting at imminent approvals.  Searches should therefore target the WHO malaria-free page, WHO Global Malaria Programme press releases, and current-year news articles about candidate countries.
