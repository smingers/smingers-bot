According to Deputy Minister of Communities and Territories Development Sergey Derkach, Order No. 1728, published on January 29, 2026, and effective three months after publication, allows drivers with valid certificates to expand their license categories or undergo training through shortened programs. The order is part of Ukraine\u2019s European integration commitments and supports the extension of the 'transport visa-free regime' with the EU. Previously issued certificates remain valid and can be converted to indefinite validity. The order mandates public photo/video documentation of training sessions, exams, and accreditation committee proceedings, with all decisions and protocols made publicly available. Training center certificates are now indefinite, eliminating the need for repeated renewal. Approved training formats include distance, dual, and blended learning, with updated curricula reflecting modern tachographs, vehicle load regulations, and safety standards. Currently, over 60,000 professional drivers in Ukraine hold valid competency certificates and are registered in the national registry, with training conducted by 30 accredited centers. Earlier, in July 2024, the government simplified booking procedures for transport companies. As of April 1, 2025, bookings are restricted to enterprises with official confirmation of critical status under new rules, and all bookings are conducted electronically via the Diya online portal. On August 13, 2025, the Cabinet of Ministers approved amendments to the conscription booking order, granting deferments from mobilization to employees of critical infrastructure enterprises in frontline areas. In November 2025, President Volodymyr Zelenskyy signed Law No. 4630-IX regulating labor relations during martial law. In January 2026, Ukraine updated the criteria for designating enterprises as critical.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 07:21 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u0412](https://biz.nv.ua/sviy-biznes/svidetelstva-uchebnyh-centrov-dlya-voditeley-stanovyatsya-bessrochnymi-novye-pravila-ukrainy-50582498.html)\n\n**Cabo Verde and United Nations Sign Annual Health Plan Focusing on Maternal, Child, and Reproductive Health**\nCabo Verde and the United Nations signed an annual work plan focused on advancing maternal, infant, and adolescent health, addressing female genital mutilation (FGM), sustaining vaccination campaigns, promoting nutrition, mental health, and eliminating mother-to-child transmission of HIV and syphilis. Health Minister Jorge Figueiredo highlighted UNICEF\u2019s critical role in enabling free access to high-cost vaccines through international support, especially amid financial constraints faced by global agencies. He emphasized that malaria remains a priority despite Cabo Verde\u2019s recent re-emergence of cases after receiving WHO\u2019s eradication certification, noting zero cases since December and preparing for the rainy season starting in July. Figueiredo acknowledged that FGM is increasingly recognized as a public health issue due to cultural ties with Africa, ongoing community outreach, and efforts to identify and register cases with mandatory staff training to detect early signs. The annual plan was signed by Cabo Verde\u2019s Ministry of Health, UNICEF, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), and the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA). UNICEF\u2019s representative in Cabo Verde, David Matern, stated the partnership will strengthen sexual and reproductive health with humanized care, improve obstetric and neonatal quality, and accelerate certification of elimination of vertical transmission of HIV, syphilis, and hepatitis B.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 08:16 PM\nSource:[Not\u00edcias ao Minuto](https://www.noticiasaominuto.com/mundo/2936299/cabo-verde-e-nacoes-unidas-assinam-plano-anual-para-a-saude)\n\n**From Food Safety to Healthcare: A Comprehensive System to Enhance National Health Security**\nEgypt has achieved significant progress in food safety, public health, and environmental sustainability, according to a comprehensive system highlighted by the United Nations Food Systems Coordination Centre. In 2025, Egypt conducted 12,800 inspection campaigns, analyzed 168,000 food samples, and achieved a 99.4% resolution rate for food safety complaints. The country seized 3,100 tons of illegal meat and 185.9 tons of prohibited pesticides, while performing 262,900 tests for tuberculosis and brucellosis in livestock. Over 2,900 veterinary medical caravans treated 1.7 million animals. Egypt became the first country to reach the 'golden level' in the global effort to eliminate Hepatitis C and achieved the regional target for Hepatitis B, reducing prevalence below 1% among children and adults aged five and above. The national food safety authority gained ISO 9001:2015 certification and began full responsibility for food safety oversight in January 2026. A nationwide surveillance system monitors 55 infectious diseases across all hospitals, and over 95% of children are vaccinated against 10 diseases. The country also launched 66.4 million health visits under the Presidential Initiative for Women\u2019s Health and screened 1.8 million students for Hepatitis C. Additional initiatives include screening 20.6 million citizens for chronic diseases since 2021, 3.7 million pregnant women since 2020, 4.6 million young adults since 2023, and 15.8 million people for cancer since 2023. The 'City of Vaccines and Biotechnology' received a gold license as a strategic project for biopharmaceutical production.

The award, granted by the World Health Organization (WHO) Executive Board, recognizes Kandil's over 25 years of contributions to public health in Egypt and the wider region. He is set to receive the prize in May 2026 during the 79th World Health Assembly, in the presence of the WHO director general and a representative of the Nelson Mandela Foundation. The award, established in 2019 to mark Nelson Mandela's centenary, honors individuals with measurable, long-term impacts on community health. Under Kandil's leadership, Egypt achieved WHO certification for elimination of polio, measles, rubella, trachoma, and malaria\u2014making it the first African country to eliminate malaria. He also led efforts to control hepatitis B among children, a regional first in the Eastern Mediterranean. Additional achievements include improvements in infection control and antimicrobial resistance programs, international accreditation of five hospitals, expansion of digital systems for vaccinations, birth and death registration, disease surveillance, and quarantine services, accreditation of 129 primary health care units, and implementation of state-funded treatment programs in 100 health facilities. The WHO Executive Board selects recipients based on leadership, long-term impact, and efforts to expand access to care and reduce health inequalities. Past winners include public health leaders behind major disease, maternal, and community health initiatives, reflecting Mandela\u2019s legacy of social justice and the right to health.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 01:19 PM\nSource:[Egyptian Streets](https://egyptianstreets.com/2026/02/09/egypts-amr-kandil-awarded-nelson-mandela-health-award-2026/)\n\n**Global Cholera Vaccine Supply Rebounds, Enabling Restart of Preventive Vaccination in Three Countries**\nUNICEF, Gavi Vaccine Alliance, and the World Health Organization (WHO) announced on February 4, 2026, that global supply of oral cholera vaccine (OCV) has recovered to a level sufficient to restart mass preventive vaccination campaigns, which had been suspended since 2022 due to a surge in global cholera cases and resulting stock shortages. Mozambique will be the first country to resume mass vaccination amid ongoing cholera outbreaks and the lingering effects of floods that displaced over 700,000 people and damaged water and sanitation infrastructure. UNICEF Executive Director Catherine Russell stated that the renewed vaccine supply enables a more effective response to large-scale cholera emergencies, emphasizing that preventive vaccination helps protect children and curb transmission, but must be combined with access to safe water and basic sanitation. The allocation of vaccines to three countries\u2014Mozambique and two others\u2014follows distribution criteria established by the Global Task Force on Cholera Control (GTFCC), a partnership of over 50 organizations ensuring equitable, transparent, and systematic delivery. While single-dose vaccination remains standard in outbreak response, two-dose regimens are considered on a case-by-case basis. Cholera, transmitted via contaminated water or food, causes severe diarrhea and dehydration, and can be fatal without prompt treatment, particularly in conflict-affected and impoverished regions. In 2025, WHO reported over 600,000 cholera or acute watery diarrhea cases across 33 countries and approximately 7,600 deaths, though actual figures are likely higher due to underreporting. Although case numbers declined after 2021, mortality rates continued to rise. UNICEF stressed that vaccination is only one component of a comprehensive strategy, which must also include sustained investment in clean water, sanitation, hygiene promotion, disease surveillance, rapid treatment, and community engagement to prevent outbreaks and reduce long-term deaths.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 07:10 AM\nSource:[\u30d7\u30ec\u30b9\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u30fb\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30b9\u30ea\u30ea\u30fc\u30b9\u914d\u4fe1\u30b7\u30a7\u30a2No.1\uff5cPR TIMES](https://prtimes.jp/main/html/rd/p/000002651.000005176.html)\n\n**Six Years After Covid-19, WHO Assesses Global Pandemic Preparedness**\nSix years after declaring the COVID-19 outbreak a public health emergency of international concern, the World Health Organization (WHO) has assessed global pandemic preparedness as marked by significant but uneven progress. While the WHO acknowledges concrete advancements\u2014including the adoption of the WHO Pandemic Agreement in May 2025, the establishment of the Pandemic Fund which has disbursed over US$1.2 billion in grants and catalyzed US$11 billion in additional funding for 67 projects across 98 countries, and the expansion of initiatives like the Epidemic Intelligence from Open Sources (EIOS) platform using AI to support over 110 countries\u2014these gains remain fragile. The WHO highlights that progress is uneven across nations and warns that declining global health financing in favor of defense and security threatens these gains. Key achievements include the BioHub, now supported by 30 countries and territories for sharing biological samples, and expanded vaccine, diagnostic, and treatment production through centers in Cape Town, South Africa, and Seoul, South Korea. The WHO also signed eight new agreements under the Influenza Pandemic Preparedness Framework in 2025, securing access to antivirals, diagnostics, syringes, and over 900 million vaccine doses. Despite improved responses to recent Ebola and Marburg outbreaks, the WHO stresses that no country can face a pandemic alone, and continuous investment, international solidarity, and sustained action are essential to maintain and strengthen global health security. The 158th session of the Executive Board was described as a decisive moment for global accountability and collaboration.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 07:06 AM\nSource:[UN News](https://news.un.org/pt/story/2026/02/1852309)\n\n**Norovirus and Influenza Outbreaks Trigger Emergency Alert: Health Authorities Urge Prevention Measures**\nThe Korea Disease Control and Prevention Agency (KDCA) has issued an emergency alert due to the spread of norovirus and influenza, urging the public to follow preventive measures ahead of the Lunar New Year holiday. Norovirus cases reached 709 in the 5th week of 2025 (January 25\u201331), with 45.1% of patients being children aged 0\u20136. B-type influenza is circulating earlier than usual, with a physician visit rate of 47.5 per 1,000 outpatient visits. The KDCA recommends influenza vaccination for high-risk groups including those aged 65 and older, pregnant women, and children aged 6 months to 13 years, with free vaccinations available in cities like Seongnam. Travelers are advised to check health advisories for 24 designated high-risk countries and submit health declarations via Q-CODE or health questionnaires upon return. For foodborne and waterborne diseases, strict hygiene practices such as washing hands for 30 seconds with soap and cooking food at 85\u00b0C for over a minute are essential. Symptoms like diarrhea or vomiting require immediate medical attention and reporting if multiple cases occur. Mosquito-borne diseases, including dengue fever (over 5 million cases reported globally in 2024), Zika virus (92 countries with low-level reports), and malaria (282 million cases, 610,000 deaths), are also a concern. Travelers should wear long sleeves, use insect repellent, and avoid mosquito bites. Free rapid dengue testing is available at national quarantine stations upon entry. The KDCA emphasized continuous surveillance and public awareness campaigns during the holiday, urging citizens to strictly follow personal hygiene practices.

The campaign will involve 87 supervisors and 516 health teams conducting door-to-door visits to administer preventive medication to approximately 6.44 lakh people. According to Chief Medical Officer Dr Arun Kumar Tiwari, five years of continuous campaigns have helped most of the district\u2019s 21 blocks achieve filariasis-free status, with only Bahadurpur and Urua showing high rates of microfilariae in recent surveys. The campaign will be initiated by local public representatives in Gram Panchayats, who will self-administer the medication. Additional CMO and Vector Borne Disease Nodal Officer Dr Rajesh Singh reported 1,590 elephantiasis and 283 hydrocele patients registered in the district. The state government is implementing a 5-pillar strategy: universal drug administration, disease management, vector control, inter-departmental coordination, and digital innovation.

The MBU, which includes updating fingerprints and iris scans, is mandatory for children aged 5 to 15, as these biometric markers are not collected for children under five due to immaturity. Failure to complete MBU may lead to difficulties in accessing government schemes and registering for competitive and university examinations. UIDAI made MBU free for children aged 7 to 15 for a one-year period starting October, and extended the free service to children aged 5\u20137 and 15\u201317. The initiative, launched in September 2025, was supported by the Unified District Information System for Education Plus (UDISE+) app, enabling real-time tracking of MBU status in schools. Through a mission-mode campaign, 83,000 school camps were conducted in just five months. UIDAI's CEO wrote to chief secretaries of all states and union territories to request cooperation in organizing these camps. The campaign will continue until all schools are covered.

Additionally, 129 primary healthcare units were accredited, and state-funded treatment was implemented in 100 health facilities.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 11:19 AM\nSource:[\u0642\u0646\u0627\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a\u0629](https://www.alarabiya.net/arab-and-world/egypt/2026/02/08/%D9%85%D8%B5%D8%B1-%D8%AA%D8%AD%D8%B5%D8%AF-%D8%AC%D8%A7%D8%A6%D8%B2%D8%A9-%D9%86%D9%8A%D9%84%D8%B3%D9%88%D9%86-%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AF%D9%8A%D9%84%D8%A7-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B9%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%84%D8%AA%D8%B9%D8%B2%D9%8A%D8%B2-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B5%D8%AD%D8%A9-2026)\n\n**Artemisinin Resistance Threatens Global Malaria Control Progress**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) released the 'World Malaria Report 2025', highlighting mixed progress in global malaria control. While WHO-recommended tools are being integrated into national health systems\u201424 countries have adopted the malaria vaccine since its 2021 approval, and seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) now covers 54 million children across 20 countries\u2014global malaria cases and deaths rose in 2024: 282 million cases (up 9 million from 2023) and 610,000 deaths (up 12,000). The report emphasizes that drug resistance, particularly to artemisinin-based combination therapies (ACTs), is a major threat. The prevalence of pfhrp2 gene deletions compromises rapid diagnostic test reliability, and resistance to pyrethroid insecticides has been confirmed in 48 countries, with multi-resistant Anopheles mosquitoes now present in nine African nations. Climate change, conflict, and weak health systems further hinder control efforts. Despite these challenges, the report notes that 170 million cases and 1 million deaths were averted in 2024, with 47 countries and one territory, including China, certified malaria-free. The Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) has seen dramatic declines in malaria incidence\u2014Cambodia (-99.5%), Laos (-99.1%), and Vietnam (-97.4%)\u2014though Myanmar remains a hotspot. Funding remains inadequate: global malaria spending reached $3.9 billion in 2024, less than half the 2025 target set by the Global Technical Strategy (GTS). The report calls for strengthened international cooperation, increased investment, and political commitment. Innovative tools like dual-component insecticide-treated nets and new vaccines are expanding, with models predicting that sustained investment could save 5.7 million children by 2045. WHO Director-General Tedros stated, 'New preventive tools give us hope, but we face major challenges.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 09, 2025 05:59 AM\nSource:[\u79d1\u5b66\u7f51](https://news.sciencenet.cn/htmlnews/2025/12/556742.shtm)\n\n**WHO Warns Malaria Progress at Risk From Drug Resistance \u2013 Famagusta Gazette**\nThe World Health Organization (WHO) warned on December 5, 2025, that progress in combating malaria is at risk due to rising drug resistance. In 2024, new tools such as dual-ingredient bed nets and malaria vaccines prevented approximately 170 million cases, saving an estimated one million lives. Since the first malaria vaccine was approved in 2021, 24 countries have integrated it into routine immunization programs. Seasonal chemoprevention expanded to 20 countries, reaching 54 million children in 2024\u2014up from 200,000 in 2012. Forty-seven countries and one territory were certified malaria-free, with Cabo Verde and Egypt achieving certification in 2024 and Georgia, Suriname, and Timor-Leste in 2025. Despite these gains, malaria caused an estimated 282 million cases and 610,000 deaths in 2024\u2014nine million more cases than in 2023. Approximately 95% of deaths occurred in Africa, primarily among children under five. Drug resistance has been confirmed or suspected in at least eight African countries, with declining efficacy observed in artemisinin-based therapies. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated, 'Increasing numbers of cases and deaths, the growing threat of drug resistance, and the impact of funding cuts all threaten to roll back the progress we have made.' He emphasized that with strong leadership and targeted investment, 'the vision of a malaria-free world remains achievable.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 05, 2025 02:15 PM\nSource:[famagusta-gazette.com](https://famagusta-gazette.com/who-warns-malaria-progress-at-risk-from-drug-resistance/)\n\n**New Tools and Vaccines Avert Millions of Malaria Cases but Major Threats Persist | Health**\nSince the World Health Organization (WHO) approved the world's first malaria vaccines in 2021, 24 countries have integrated them into routine immunization programs. In 2024, expanded use of advanced prevention tools\u2014including dual-ingredient insecticide-treated nets and seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC)\u2014helped avert an estimated 170 million malaria cases and 1 million deaths, according to the latest World Malaria Report. SMC reached 54 million children in 2024, up from 200,000 in 2012. Forty-seven countries and one territory have been certified malaria-free, with Cabo Verde and Egypt achieving this status in 2024, and Georgia, Suriname, and Timor-Leste expected to follow in 2025. Despite these gains, 282 million malaria cases and 610,000 deaths were reported globally in 2024\u20149 million more cases than in 2023\u2014with 95% of deaths occurring in the WHO African Region. Key threats include growing artemisinin resistance in at least eight African countries, climate-driven changes in mosquito habitats, conflict disrupting health services, and insufficient funding: global malaria financing reached $3.9 billion in 2024, far below the $9.3 billion 2025 target. The development of Ganaplacide-Lumefantrine, the first non-artemisinin combination therapy, marks a critical advance in combating drug resistance. WHO is urging renewed political commitment through initiatives like the Yaound\u00e9 Declaration and the Big Push.

However, increasing drug resistance is threatening global progress toward eliminating malaria. WHO-recommended tools are being increasingly integrated into broader health systems: since the 2021 approval of the first global malaria vaccine, 24 countries have incorporated it into routine immunization programs. Seasonal malaria chemoprevention has expanded to 20 countries, covering 54 million children in 2024\u2014up from about 200,000 in 2012. While 49 countries and territories have received WHO certification for malaria elimination, global estimates show 282 million malaria cases and 610,000 deaths in 2024\u2014900,000 more cases than the previous year\u2014with 95% of deaths occurring in WHO's African Region, mostly among children under five. Evidence of partial resistance to artemisinin derivatives, the current cornerstone of malaria treatment after the failure of chloroquine and sulfadoxine-pyrimethamine, has been confirmed or suspected in at least eight African countries, with reduced efficacy also observed in partner drugs. The report highlights additional threats, including biological risks such as the spread of insecticide-resistant Anopheles mosquitoes to African nations, which complicates urban malaria control. WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated, 'New malaria prevention tools bring new hope, but we still face serious challenges: rising case and death numbers, intensifying drug resistance, and funding cuts\u2014all threatening the progress made over the past 20 years.'

The WHO attributes this increase to growing drug resistance, reduced funding, and the impacts of climate change and conflict. In a statement, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus emphasized that while challenges remain, the vision of a malaria-free world is still achievable through leadership from affected countries and targeted investments. Africa remains the hardest-hit region, accounting for 94% of cases and 95% of deaths, with 75% of fatalities occurring among children under five. Five countries\u2014Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Uganda\u2014accounted for over half of global cases. Despite setbacks, progress has been made: 24 countries have introduced malaria vaccines into routine immunization since 2021, and seasonal malaria chemoprevention now reaches 54 million children in 20 countries, up from 200,000 in 2012. As of 2024\u20132025, 47 countries and one territory have been certified malaria-free, including Cape Verde, Egypt, Georgia, Suriname, and Timor-Leste. Daniel Ngamije, WHO\u2019s malaria coordinator, warned that underfunding poses a significant risk of a massive and uncontrollable resurgence. Global malaria mortality stands at 13.8 deaths per 100,000 people\u2014more than three times the 2030 target of 4.5 per 100,000. However, new tools offer hope: Novartis reported positive data in November 2024 for GanLum (ganaplacide/lumefantrine), a non-artemisinin-based treatment, marking 'the beginning of a new chapter' in the fight against malaria, according to Martin Fitchet of Medicines for Malaria Venture (MMV).\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 12:18 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/873F39E)\n\n**New tools saved a million lives from malaria last year but progress under threat as drug resistance rises**\nAccording to the World Health Organization's (WHO) 2025 World Malaria Report, new malaria prevention tools\u2014including dual-ingredient insecticide-treated nets and WHO-recommended vaccines\u2014helped prevent an estimated 170 million cases and 1 million deaths in 2024. Since the WHO approved the first malaria vaccines in 2021, 24 countries have integrated them into routine immunization programs. Seasonal malaria chemoprevention expanded to 20 countries, reaching 54 million children in 2024, up from 0.2 million in 2012. As of 2025, 47 countries and one territory have been certified malaria-free, including Cabo Verde, Egypt (2024), and Georgia, Suriname, and Timor-Leste (2025). Despite these gains, 282 million malaria cases and 610,000 deaths were reported in 2024\u2014about 9 million more cases than in 2023\u2014with 95% of deaths occurring in the WHO African Region, primarily among children under 5. Antimalarial drug resistance, particularly to artemisinin derivatives, is rising, with confirmed or suspected resistance in at least 8 African countries and declining efficacy of artemisinin combination therapies. Additionally, 48 countries report pyrethroid resistance in mosquitoes, and Anopheles stephensi, resistant to common insecticides, has spread to 9 African nations. Malaria diagnostic reliability is compromised by pfhrp2 gene deletions in parasites, and extreme weather events are altering transmission patterns. Conflict and instability disrupt health services, while global funding has plateaued at $3.9 billion in 2024\u2014less than half the $9.3 billion 2025 target. Official Development Assistance (ODA) cuts have disrupted surveillance, delayed surveys, and risked stock-outs. Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, WHO Director-General, emphasized that while progress is under threat, the goal of a malaria-free world remains achievable with sustained leadership and investment. Dr. Martin Fitchet of Medicines for Malaria Venture highlighted the development of Ganaplacide-Lumefantrine, the first non-artemisinin combination therapy, as a breakthrough in combating resistance.

The certification was presented to Andr\u00e9 Misiekaba, Minister of Health, Welfare, and Labour, during a ceremony in Washington, D.C., attended by Albert Ramdin, Secretary-General of the Organization of American States (OAS). Misiekaba reflected on decades of effort to control malaria, recalling that in 2002 Suriname had the highest number of cases on the continent and that he himself had been severely ill, nearly dying from the disease. He credited the success to improved access to diagnosis and treatment, as well as broad societal engagement. However, he warned that the country\u2019s malaria-free status remains vulnerable due to open borders and intensive migration, particularly through small-scale mining activities. He emphasized that only a coordinated transnational approach across the Amazon region can ensure the long-term sustainability of this achievement.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 03:00 AM\nSource:[www.starnieuws.com](https://www.starnieuws.com/index.php/welcome/index/nieuwsitem/88502)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
