World Malaria Report 2024 (issued 4 Dec 2024) \u2013 chapter on progress towards elimination  \n   \u2022 \u201cGeorgia and Turkey have submitted their request for malaria-free certification.\u201d (Beatmalaria summary of the report, 4 Dec 2024).  \n   \u2022 The report does not state an exact date but, by convention, the Technical Advisory Group on Malaria Elimination and Certification (TAG-MEC) meets once a year and the WHO Director-General normally takes a decision within the same or the following calendar year.  The wording therefore implies that a verdict was expected in 2025.  (Beatmalaria, citing World Malaria Report 2024).  \n\n2.  World Malaria Report 2025 (released 4 Dec 2025) \u2013 elimination chapter  \n   \u2022 Confirms that Bhutan \u201cis on track to achieving malaria-free certification soon, having sustained zero indigenous cases for the third consecutive year,\u201d and that \u201cMalaysia continues to report zero indigenous human cases for the seventh consecutive year.\u201d  (APLMA press release drawing on the report, 4 Dec 2025).  \n   \u2022 Although this again gives no formal deadline, WHO rules require at least three years of zero cases followed by a dossier review; the phrasing \u201con track\u2026soon\u201d signals that Bhutan\u2019s dossier will go to TAG-MEC in 2026, with a Director-General decision likely the same year.  \n\n3.  No WHO press release or statement dated 2024-2026 was found that:  \n   \u2022 names Belize (already certified 21 Jun 2023) or Timor-Leste (certified 24 Jul 2025) as \u201cawaiting\u201d certification; or  \n   \u2022 gives a calendar quarter or month when TAG-MEC or the Director-General is due to rule on Bhutan or Malaysia.  \n\nConclusion for Objective 1:  \n\u2022 WHO pipeline information for 2024-2026 is confined to two annual flagship reports that mention Georgia, Turkey, Bhutan and Malaysia in qualitative terms only.  \n\u2022 No WHO communication in the period gives a specific decision timetable for Belize, Bhutan, Timor-Leste or Malaysia.  \n\u2022 Additional targeted checking of the TAG-MEC meeting reports and of WHO\u2019s \u201cPreparing for certification\u201d country dossiers would be required to find firmer dates for Bhutan and Malaysia \u2013 these were not returned in the current results set.\n\nObjective 2 \u2013 Every malaria-free certification since 2015, month of WHO announcement, and calculation of the average yearly frequency (2015-2025 inclusive)  \n\nThe WHO \u201cCountries and territories certified malaria-free\u201d register (last updated 15 Jul 2025) plus individual WHO news releases yield the list below.  Months are taken from the dateline of each WHO news release (or, where not yet retrieved, from secondary sources noted with *).  \n\n2015  \n\u2022 Maldives \u2013 17 Sep 2015*  \n\n2016  \n\u2022 Kyrgyzstan \u2013 8 Jul 2016 (WHO news release)  \n\u2022 Sri Lanka \u2013 5 Sep 2016 (WHO news release)  \n\n2017  \n\u2022 none  \n\n2018  \n\u2022 Uzbekistan \u2013 14 Feb 2018 (WHO news release)  \n\u2022 Paraguay \u2013 11 Jun 2018 (WHO news release)  \n\n2019  \n\u2022 Algeria \u2013 22 May 2019 (WHO news release)  \n\u2022 Argentina \u2013 22 May 2019 (same release as Algeria)  \n\n2020  \n\u2022 none  \n\n2021  \n\u2022 El Salvador \u2013 25 Feb 2021 (WHO news release)  \n\u2022 China \u2013 30 Jun 2021 (WHO news release)  \n\n2022  \n\u2022 none  \n\n2023  \n\u2022 Azerbaijan \u2013 29 Mar 2023* (WHO Europe news release)  \n\u2022 Tajikistan \u2013 29 Mar 2023* (same release as Azerbaijan)  \n\u2022 Belize \u2013 21 Jun 2023 (WHO news release)  \n\n2024  \n\u2022 Cabo Verde \u2013 12 Jan 2024* (WHO AFRO news release cited in The Conversation, 2 Feb 2024)  \n\u2022 Egypt \u2013 12 Dec 2024* (date inferred from WHO EMRO newsroom timeline)  \n\n2025  \n\u2022 Georgia \u2013 6 Feb 2025* (press reports quoting WHO announcement)  \n\u2022 Timor-Leste \u2013 24 Jul 2025 (WHO news release)  \n\u2022 Suriname \u2013 15 Jul 2025* (first appearance in WHO global register updated that day)  \n\nTotal certifications 2015-2025 = 17 across 11 calendar years.  \nAverage yearly frequency = 17 \u00f7 11 = 1.55 certifications per year.  \n\nObjective 3 \u2013 Remaining information gaps  \n\n1.  Precise WHO press-release dates for Maldives 2015, Azerbaijan 2023, Tajikistan 2023, Cabo Verde 2024, Egypt 2024, Georgia 2025 and Suriname 2025 were inferred from secondary sources (*) and should be verified against the original WHO newsroom pages.  \n2.  No WHO source retrieved here provides an explicit decision timetable for pending dossiers (Bhutan, Malaysia).  TAG-MEC meeting reports for 2024-2026 and the 2026 World Malaria Report should be reviewed when available.  \n3.  It is unclear whether Turkey, mentioned in the 2024 report as having submitted its dossier, received certification in late 2025 or early 2026; that outcome is not captured in the current register.  \n\nThe core quantitative answer \u2013 17 certifications since 2015, averaging 1.55 per year \u2013 is therefore solid, but month-level dating for seven of those certifications and forward-looking decision dates for Bhutan and Malaysia remain to be documented directly from WHO sources.</Agent_report>\n"
