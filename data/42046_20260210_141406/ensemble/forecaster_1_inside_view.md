Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Official EU Sources (Highest Quality):**
- **Digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu (Code contents page)**: Published July 10, 2025. States the Code was "published" and "endorsed by the Commission and the AI Board." No mention of revision plans. Factual, authoritative source.
- **Digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu (Drawing-up page)**: Describes the multi-stakeholder drafting process. No mention of future revisions. Factual.

**Legal/Professional Commentary (High Quality):**
- **Kluwer Copyright Blog**: Discusses second and third drafts, noting third draft was "set to be the last draft" with final version expected May 2, 2025. Published before final version. Factual reporting.
- **IAPP (May 2025)**: Reports Commission received "final version" of Code. Quotes MEPs expressing concerns about last-minute changes. Mix of factual reporting and expert opinions from identifiable sources (Benifei, Virkkunen).
- **Jonesday (August 2025)**: Reports Code published July 10, 2025, expected endorsement August 2, 2025. Factual legal analysis.
- **JD Supra/Pillsbury**: Discusses potential delays in AI Act enforcement, mentions "recent delay of the GPAI Code until August." Factual but notes delays "yet to be confirmed publicly."
- **Crowell & Moring (July 2025)**: Describes "final version" published July 11, 2025. Emphasizes voluntary nature. Factual legal analysis.

**AskNews Articles (Recent, February 2026):**
- **Multiple sources (Feb 9-10, 2026)**: All focus on EU Commission's antitrust action against Meta regarding WhatsApp AI access. No mention of GPAI Code revisions. These are current but unrelated to the question.
- **Lexology (Jan 19, 2026)**: Reports Commission proposed delaying certain AI Act obligations, mentions "draft Code of Practice on transparency of AI-generated content" with "further drafts expected in March 2026." **Critical distinction**: This refers to a *different* code of practice (transparency/Article 50), not the GPAI code (Articles 53/55).
- **Mondaq/Lexology (Sept-Oct 2025)**: Multiple articles describing the published GPAI Code as "final version." Factual legal analysis.

**Key Factual Finding**: The January 2026 Lexology article mentions a "draft Code of Practice on transparency" with drafts expected in March 2026, but this is explicitly about Article 50 (transparency of AI-generated content), NOT the GPAI Code of Practice (Articles 53/55). This is a separate code entirely.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence Against Revision:**
1. **Multiple independent sources confirm finalization**: Digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu, Jonesday, Crowell & Moring, IAPP all independently confirm the Code was published as "final version" in July 2025. This is the highest quality evidence.
2. **Structural timeline**: The Code went through extensive drafting (Nov 2024-March 2025), followed by finalization (July 2025) and endorsement (August 2025). This represents a completed regulatory cycle.
3. **Two-year review cycle**: Multiple sources reference biennial reviews, pointing to mid-2027 for updates. This is standard EU practice and represents institutional momentum against near-term revision.

**Moderate Evidence Against Revision:**
1. **Implementation phase activity**: All post-July 2025 activity focuses on implementation (signatories, complementary guidance, specific consultations). No signals of revision planning.
2. **Recent finalization**: Only 7 months have passed since publication (as of Feb 2026). EU regulatory processes typically require 12-24 months between major versions.

**Weak Evidence (Neutral/Ambiguous):**
1. **Separate transparency code**: The January 2026 mention of "draft Code of Practice" drafts in March 2026 refers to a different code (Article 50), not the GPAI Code. This could cause confusion but is not evidence for GPAI Code revision.
2. **Stakeholder concerns**: Some MEPs and industry groups expressed concerns about the final Code, but no evidence these concerns triggered revision processes.

**No Evidence Supporting Revision:**
- Zero sources mention plans, announcements, or consultations for a revised GPAI Code draft
- No evidence of implementation problems requiring urgent revision
- No Commission statements suggesting revision

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: February 10, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = 80 days (2.7 months)

**If timeframe were halved (40 days, to ~March 22, 2026)**: Probability would drop to ~2%. The EU's deliberative process makes any revision in 40 days nearly impossible.

**If timeframe were doubled (160 days, to ~July 19, 2026)**: Probability might increase to ~8-10%. A 5.3-month window would allow for emergency consultations if critical issues emerged, though still unlikely given the two-year review cycle.

**Current timeframe assessment**: 80 days is extremely short for EU regulatory processes. Even if the Commission decided today to revise the Code, producing a new draft would require:
- Internal deliberation (2-4 weeks)
- Stakeholder consultation announcement (1-2 weeks)
- Consultation period (typically 4-8 weeks minimum)
- Draft preparation (2-4 weeks)

This totals 9-18 weeks minimum, making the 11.4-week window very tight even in an accelerated scenario.

## (d) Justification

**Factors maintaining low outside view base rate (4%):**

1. **Institutional inertia** (Strong): The EU's regulatory process is deliberately slow and consultative. The GPAI Code underwent 8 months of drafting with ~1000 stakeholders. Repeating this process within 2.7 months contradicts institutional norms.

2. **Recent finalization** (Strong): Only 7 months post-publication. EU codes typically have 18-36 month gaps between major versions. The Code is still in early implementation phase.

3. **Explicit review timeline** (Strong): Multiple sources reference two-year review cycles, pointing to mid-2027. This represents stated institutional commitment.

4. **No triggering events** (Strong): Zero evidence of implementation problems, legal challenges, or stakeholder pressure sufficient to trigger emergency revision. Current news focuses on unrelated antitrust issues.

**Factors that could increase probability:**
- None identified in sources. The only "draft code" mentioned for March 2026 is a different code (Article 50 transparency), not the GPAI Code.

**Conclusion**: Current circumstances are entirely consistent with the reference class (EU codes of practice post-finalization). No factors justify shifting from the outside view base rate. If anything, the complete absence of any revision signals in sources suggests the base rate might be slightly high.

## Probability Calibration

**Outside view base rate**: 4%

**Inside view adjustments**:
- **No positive signals**: Zero sources mention GPAI Code revision plans
- **Confusion factor**: The January 2026 mention of "draft code" for March 2026 refers to a different code, but could cause confusion in monitoring
- **Timeframe constraint**: 80 days is extremely short for EU processes
- **Implementation focus**: All activity since July 2025 has been implementation-focused

**Calibration reasoning**:
- At 4%: This represents 1:24 odds. Out of 25 similar situations (EU codes 7 months post-finalization, with 80-day windows), we'd expect revision in ~1 case.
- At 2%: This represents 1:49 odds. More conservative but perhaps too low given general regulatory uncertainty.
- At 6%: This represents 1:15.7 odds. Allows more room for unexpected developments but seems high given complete absence of signals.

The evidence is overwhelmingly against revision. The only argument for maintaining 4% is general epistemic humility about regulatory processes. However, the complete absence of any revision signals, combined with the very short timeframe, suggests even 4% may be generous.

**Final calibration**: 3%

This represents 1:32.3 odds, acknowledging:
- Extremely strong evidence against revision
- Very short timeframe
- No identified triggering events
- But maintaining small probability for unknown unknowns in complex regulatory environment

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will the EU AI Office publish a new/revised draft of the GPAI Code of Practice between Feb 10, 2026 and May 1, 2026? (80-day window)
   - ✓ Aligned with resolution criteria requiring "draft document explicitly labeled as draft or consultation draft of revised/new version"

2. **Outside view base rate**: 4% (based on EU code revision patterns, two-year review cycles, recent finalization)
   - ✓ Final prediction (3%) is rooted in this base rate with slight downward adjustment based on evidence

3. **Consistency check**: "3 out of 100 times, the EU AI Office publishes a revised GPAI Code draft within 80 days of Feb 10, 2026."
   - ✓ This aligns with the extremely low probability of rapid EU regulatory revision absent triggering events

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - Code published as "final version" July 2025 (7 months ago) - multiple authoritative sources confirm
   - Two-year review cycle referenced in multiple sources, pointing to mid-2027 for updates
   - Zero sources mention revision plans, announcements, or consultations for GPAI Code
   - ✓ All three are factually valid and from high-quality sources

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: The EU Commission identifies a critical legal or technical flaw in the Code requiring urgent revision, and accelerates the process dramatically. This could increase probability to ~10-15%, but would require both (a) discovery of critical flaw and (b) unprecedented process acceleration.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Status quo is no revision. Given 7 months since finalization, implementation phase focus, and stated two-year review cycle, status quo strongly favors "No" outcome. Low volatility situation.

Probability: 3%
