Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

**Official EU sources (high quality, factual):**
- Digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu (Drawing-up page): Describes the initial drafting process that led to the Code of Practice. Factual account of the multi-stakeholder process. Does not mention plans for revised drafts.
- Digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu (Third draft announcement): Published information about the third draft in March 2025, stating it was "the last drafting round" with the final Code expected in May 2025. High-quality factual source.
- Code-of-practice.ai: States this is the "final version" dated 10/07/2025 (July 10, 2025). While unofficial, it references official PDF documents from the AI Office.

**Legal/professional commentary (medium-high quality):**
- Jonesday (August 2025): Reports the Code was published July 10, 2025, expected to be endorsed by Member States. Factual reporting from a reputable law firm.
- Taylorwessing (April 2025): Reports third draft status with final version expected May 2025. Reputable legal source, factual.
- Inside Privacy (December 2025): Discusses copyright consultation "in line with the GPAI Code of Practice" and mentions reviews "at least every two years—in line with updates to the GPAI Code of Practice." This is the only source suggesting potential future updates, but it's describing a consultation process, not announcing a new draft.
- Wired-gov.net (July 2025): Reports "final version" with sign-up deadline August 1, 2025. Factual reporting.

**Agent report (comprehensive research):**
The agent provides a detailed chronology:
- First draft: November 15, 2024
- Second draft: December 19, 2024
- Third draft: March 11, 2025
- Final version: July 10, 2025
- Vademecum (procedural, not substantive): September 18, 2025

Key finding: The agent notes a "two-year review clause" suggesting updates expected mid-2027, and mentions the copyright-protocol consultation (Dec 2025-Jan 2026) will be "reviewed regularly, at least every two years, in line with updates to the Code of Practice." However, as of February 2026, "no new draft or revision has been published or formally announced."

(b) Reference class analysis:

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **EU regulatory codes of practice generally**: The EU typically develops codes through extensive consultation, publishes a final version, then reviews on a multi-year cycle (often 2-3 years). Revisions within the first year after finalization are rare unless significant issues emerge.

2. **AI Act implementation documents specifically**: The AI Act is new (2024), so there's limited history. However, the pattern shows: extensive drafting (3 drafts over 5 months), finalization, then implementation focus rather than immediate revision.

3. **Similar EU digital policy frameworks**: GDPR codes of conduct, DSA/DMA implementation—these typically have long gaps (1-2+ years) between initial publication and substantive revisions.

**Most suitable reference class**: AI Act implementation documents and EU codes of practice generally. These show that after a final version is published following extensive consultation, there's typically a period of implementation and monitoring before revisions are considered. The two-year review cycle mentioned in sources suggests 2027 as the expected timeframe for updates.

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Prediction timeframe**: February 10, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = approximately 2.5 months (80 days)

**Historical pattern from sources:**
- July 10, 2025: Final Code published
- August 1, 2025: Signatory deadline
- September 18, 2025: Vademecum (procedural only, not a new draft)
- December 2025-January 2026: Copyright protocol consultation (complementary, not a Code revision)
- February 10, 2026: Question opens (7 months post-finalization)
- May 1, 2026: Question closes (10 months post-finalization)

The pattern shows no substantive revisions in the 7 months since finalization. The only activity has been implementation-focused (signatories, complementary guidance, specific consultations on technical protocols).

(d) Justification:

The evidence strongly suggests a revised draft is unlikely in the forecast period:

1. **Recent finalization**: The Code was only finalized July 2025, after an extensive 8-month drafting process (Nov 2024-July 2025) involving ~1000 stakeholders. This represents significant investment in getting it right.

2. **Implementation phase**: The period since July 2025 has focused on implementation—getting signatories, publishing complementary guidance, conducting specific technical consultations. This is typical post-finalization behavior.

3. **Stated review cycle**: Multiple sources reference a "two-year review" cycle, pointing to mid-2027 for updates. This is standard EU practice.

4. **No signals of problems**: There's no evidence in any source of significant issues, stakeholder complaints, or Commission statements suggesting the need for near-term revision.

5. **Consultation timing**: The December 2025 copyright-protocol consultation is complementary to the Code, not a revision of it. It closes January 2026, and even if it triggered Code changes, the process would likely extend beyond May 2026.

6. **Agent finding**: Explicitly states "as of February 2026, no new draft or revision has been published or formally announced."

The only scenario favoring a "Yes" outcome would be if unexpected implementation problems emerged requiring urgent revision. However, there's no evidence of this, and even if problems arose, the EU's deliberative process makes a full revised draft within 2.5 months unlikely.

Outside view calibration:

(a) **True probability vs. hedging**: I need to assess the genuine likelihood, not hedge. The evidence is quite clear that no revision is planned or underway.

(b) **Rough figures from sources**: The two-year review cycle (mid-2027) is the only concrete timeframe mentioned. No source suggests activity in the forecast window.

(c) **Probability precision**: 
- 5% = 1:19 odds (very unlikely but possible)
- 2% = 1:49 odds (highly unlikely)
- 10% = 1:9 odds (unlikely but not rare)

(d) **Rate of unexpected outcomes**: EU regulatory processes are generally predictable and slow-moving. Unexpected rapid revisions are rare but not impossible if:
- Major legal challenges emerge
- Significant technical issues are discovered
- Political pressure forces acceleration

However, even in these cases, the EU typically takes months to produce revised drafts through proper consultation. The 2.5-month window is very short for EU processes.

Given:
- Clear two-year review cycle pointing to 2027
- No evidence of problems or planned revisions
- Only 7 months since finalization (very recent)
- EU's deliberative, slow-moving process
- 2.5-month forecast window

But allowing for:
- Small possibility of urgent technical/legal issues emerging
- Potential for accelerated process if critical need identified
- Uncertainty in complex regulatory environments
