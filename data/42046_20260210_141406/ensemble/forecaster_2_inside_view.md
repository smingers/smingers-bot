Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

**Web Articles:**
1. **Kluwer Copyright Blog** (undated, discusses third draft): Factual summary of three drafts released through March 2025, with final version expected May 2, 2025. Working Groups opinion that third draft lacked clarity. High reliability for factual timeline; opinions from named stakeholder groups (Working Groups) are credible but represent advocacy positions.

2. **EU Commission official page** (accessed showing July 10, 2025 publication): Factual confirmation that final Code was published July 10, 2025, endorsed by Commission and AI Board. No mention of future revisions. Highest reliability - primary source.

3. **IAPP article** (undated, discusses "final version received"): Factual account of final Code delivery, development process, and stakeholder reactions. Named sources include Commission VP Virkkunen (supportive), MEP Benifei (critical of last-minute changes), and industry representatives. High reliability; mix of official statements and stakeholder opinions.

4. **Jones Day** (July 2025): Factual legal analysis of published Code structure and timeline. States Code expected to be endorsed "in coming weeks" after July 10. High reliability for factual content; standard law firm commentary.

5. **JD Supra/Pillsbury** (undated, discusses "recent delay"): Reports May 2025 speculation about potential enforcement delays and "simplification efforts." Notes delays "yet to be confirmed publicly." Moderate reliability - discusses unconfirmed rumors alongside factual AI Act timeline.

6. **Crowell & Moring** (July 17, 2025): Factual analysis of final Code published July 11, 2025. Emphasizes voluntary nature and lack of legal certainty. High reliability for factual content.

**AskNews Articles (all February 2026):**
Multiple articles about EU Commission's antitrust action against Meta regarding WhatsApp AI assistant access. None mention GPAI Code revisions. These are entirely about competition enforcement, not Code revision. High factual reliability but irrelevant to the question.

One relevant article: **Lexology (January 19, 2026)**: States "draft Code of Practice on transparency of AI-generated content was released on 17 December 2025, with further drafts expected in March 2026 and a final version by May or June 2026." This refers to a **different** Code (Article 50 transparency), not the GPAI Code (Articles 53/55). High reliability but addresses wrong subject.

**Critical finding:** No source mentions plans for a revised GPAI Code draft. The January 2026 Lexology article confirms a separate transparency Code is in development, but this is explicitly tied to Article 50, not the GPAI Code.

(b) Evidence analysis:

**Strong evidence against revision:**
- Primary EU source confirms final Code published July 10, 2025, with no mention of revision plans (highest reliability)
- Multiple independent legal sources (Jones Day, Crowell & Moring, IAPP) treat July 2025 publication as "final version" with no discussion of imminent revisions
- Code itself contains "at least every two years" review clause, suggesting mid-2027 earliest for formal revision
- Standard EU consultation timelines (4-6 months) exceed remaining 80 days to resolution

**Moderate evidence against revision:**
- Historical pattern: EU codes rarely revised within first 12 months (reference class shows 12.5% base rate, adjusted to 1.4% for 2.6-month window)
- Commission currently focused on implementation (signatory enrollment, complementary guidance) rather than reopening drafting

**Weak evidence:**
- Stakeholder criticism (MEPs, civil society) about last-minute changes could theoretically trigger rapid revision, but no concrete indication this is occurring
- Potential "simplification" efforts mentioned in May 2025 rumors, but these were about enforcement delays, not Code revision

**No positive evidence:** Zero sources suggest a revised GPAI Code draft is planned or underway.

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Prediction window:** 80 days (February 10 - May 1, 2026)

**If halved (40 days):** Would strengthen "No" prediction to ~1-2%, as even emergency EU processes rarely complete in 40 days.

**If doubled (160 days/~5 months):** Would increase slightly to ~5-7%, as this approaches the minimum viable timeline for EU consultation processes, though still well below the two-year review schedule.

The very short timeframe is a critical constraint. EU processes are institutionally slow: even fast-tracked consultations require public notice, stakeholder input periods (typically 4-8 weeks minimum), drafting, and publication. No consultation has been announced.

(d) Justification:

**Status quo outcome:** No revised draft published. The Commission just completed a multi-year, multi-stakeholder process culminating in July 2025 publication. Current focus is on implementation, not revision.

**Factors supporting outside view (3% base rate):**

1. **Institutional inertia:** EU just invested ~9 months (September 2024 - July 2025) in three draft iterations. Standard practice is to allow implementation period before revision.

2. **Explicit review schedule:** Code contains biennial review clause, signaling no revision before mid-2027.

3. **Process requirements:** EU transparency requirements mandate public consultation periods incompatible with 80-day window.

4. **Current priorities:** Commission focused on enforcement (Meta antitrust case), complementary guidance, and separate Article 50 transparency Code - not GPAI Code revision.

**Could factors justify large shift from 3% base rate?**

Theoretically, a major AI incident or political crisis could trigger emergency revision. However:
- No such trigger event has occurred or is reported
- Even emergency EU processes take 3-4 months minimum
- No consultation announcement, which would be mandatory first step

**Conclusion:** Current circumstances strongly reinforce the outside view. The 80-day window is too short for standard EU processes, no revision consultation has been announced, and institutional focus is elsewhere. The 3% base rate already accounts for low-probability shocks; current evidence suggests even this may be generous.

Probability calibration:

The outside view established a 3% baseline for a revised draft within the first 12 months, adjusted to ~1.4% for the specific 2.6-month window, then rounded to 3% to account for unexpected shocks.

Current information provides no positive evidence for revision and substantial negative evidence:
- Zero sources mention revision plans
- All sources treat July 2025 publication as final/stable
- Institutional focus is on implementation and separate codes
- Timeline constraints are severe (80 days vs. 4-6 month minimum process)

However, I must account for:
- Possibility of unpublicized internal discussions
- Potential for emergency procedures in response to unforeseen events
- Inherent uncertainty in predicting bureaucratic decisions

The evidence strongly supports staying at or below the 3% outside view baseline. Given the complete absence of any positive indicators and the severe timeline constraints, I'm inclined to adjust slightly downward to 2%, but this risks overconfidence. The 3% baseline already incorporates shock scenarios, and current evidence doesn't justify going lower - it simply confirms the baseline reasoning.

**Final calibration:** 3% (maintaining outside view baseline, as current evidence reinforces rather than contradicts it)

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will EU AI Office publish a new/revised GPAI Code draft between Feb 10-May 1, 2026 (80 days)? Must be official draft on EU page, clearly labeled as revised version.

2. **Base rate:** 3% from outside view (EU codes rarely revised within first year; adjusted for short timeframe and shock probability).

3. **Consistency:** "3 out of 100 times, the AI Office publishes a revised GPAI Code draft within 80 days of this forecast." This aligns with rare emergency revisions in EU regulatory history.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Final Code published July 2025; all sources treat as stable (strong negative)
   - No consultation announced; EU processes require 4-6 months minimum (strong negative)
   - Code contains biennial review clause suggesting mid-2027 revision (moderate negative)
   - Commission focused on implementation and separate Article 50 Code (moderate negative)
   - Zero sources mention revision plans (strong negative)

5. **Blind spot:** A major AI safety incident or political crisis could trigger emergency revision procedures I'm not aware of, potentially compressing timelines through extraordinary measures. This might raise probability to 8-10%.

6. **Status quo:** Strong status quo bias toward "No" - Commission just completed major process, standard practice is implementation before revision, no triggers for change evident.

Probability: 3%
