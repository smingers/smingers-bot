Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

**Official EU Commission sources (highest quality):**
- Digital-strategy.ec.europa.eu articles (multiple): These are primary sources describing the official drafting process. They confirm three consultation drafts were released (November 2024, December 19 2024, and March 11 2025), with the final Code published July 10, 2025. The sources note the process was "iterative" but describe the July 2025 publication as the "final version."

- Code-of-practice.ai (July 10, 2025): Unofficial but references official PDF. Explicitly states this is the "final version" dated 10/07/2025.

**Legal/professional commentary (high quality, factual):**
- Jonesday.com (August 2025): Reports July 10, 2025 publication of the Code, expected endorsement by August 2, 2025. Factual reporting of timeline and structure.

- Taylorwessing.com (April 29, 2025): Reports third draft expected in "final form in May" 2025. This was accurate - the final version came July 2025.

- Wired-gov.net (July 25, 2025): Describes "final version" with sign-up deadline August 1, 2025. No mention of future drafts.

- InsidePrivacy.com (December 18, 2025): Discusses copyright consultation "in line with the GPAI Code of Practice" and mentions solutions will be "reviewed regularly—at least every two years—in line with updates to the GPAI Code of Practice." This suggests future updates are contemplated but provides no specific timeline or announcement of a revised draft.

**Agent report (comprehensive):**
The agent report provides a detailed chronology confirming:
- Three consultation drafts: November 15, 2024; December 19, 2024; March 11, 2025
- Final version: July 10, 2025
- Only subsequent document: September 18, 2025 "Vademecum" (procedural, not a substantive draft)
- Two-year review clause mentioned but no new draft announced as of February 2026
- Copyright-protocol consultation (December 2025-January 2026) is about implementation details, not a Code revision

**Key factual findings:**
1. The final Code was published July 10, 2025
2. A two-year review cycle is mentioned in sources, suggesting updates around mid-2027
3. As of February 10, 2026, no revised draft has been announced or published
4. The copyright consultation (closed January 2026) concerns implementation protocols, not a Code revision

(b) Reference class analysis:

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **EU regulatory codes of practice post-finalization**: How often does the EU publish revised drafts of finalized codes within the first year? This is highly relevant but limited historical data exists for AI-specific codes.

2. **EU AI Act implementation documents**: The AI Act is new (2024), so there's limited precedent for revision cycles of its implementing documents.

3. **EU digital policy iterative processes**: The Commission has a pattern of iterative consultation (GDPR guidelines, DSA/DMA codes), but these typically involve guidance documents rather than revised drafts of codes after finalization.

4. **Stated review cycles in EU documents**: The sources mention a "two-year review" cycle and "regular updates," suggesting the Commission plans updates but on a longer timeframe than the question's window.

**Most suitable reference class:** The stated two-year review cycle combined with the Commission's typical practice of not immediately revising finalized codes. The question asks about a revised draft by May 1, 2026 - only 10 months after the July 2025 final publication.

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Prediction timeframe:** 80 days (February 10 to May 1, 2026)

**Historical pattern:**
- The drafting process took 9 months (September 2024 kick-off to July 2025 final)
- Three consultation drafts were released over 8 months
- After the final version (July 10, 2025), only procedural documents have been published
- The two-year review clause suggests mid-2027 for substantive updates
- As of today (February 10, 2026), 7 months have passed since finalization with no revised draft announced

**Relevant considerations:**
- The copyright consultation (December 2025-January 2026) just closed, but this concerns implementation protocols, not Code revision
- No official announcement or indication of a revised draft in the works
- The Commission typically requires substantial time for multi-stakeholder consultation before publishing drafts
- 80 days is a very short window for developing, consulting on, and publishing a revised draft

(d) Justification:

The outside view strongly suggests a low probability of a revised draft by May 1, 2026:

1. **Timing**: Only 7 months have passed since the final Code was published, well short of the stated two-year review cycle.

2. **No signals**: None of the sources (including the most recent from December 2025) mention an upcoming revised draft. The Agent report explicitly states "As of February 2026, no new draft or revision has been published or formally announced."

3. **Process requirements**: The Commission's multi-stakeholder process requires months of preparation, consultation, and drafting. The original process took 9 months from kick-off to final publication. Even a revision would likely require 3-6 months minimum.

4. **Recent activity focus**: The Commission's recent activity (copyright protocol consultation, sandbox implementation) focuses on implementing the existing Code, not revising it.

5. **Institutional practice**: EU institutions typically don't rapidly revise finalized regulatory documents unless there's a critical need or legal requirement. The Code appears to be functioning as intended.

6. **Base rate**: For newly finalized EU regulatory codes, revision within the first year is uncommon absent major implementation problems or legal challenges.

Outside view calibration:

(a) True probability consideration: I need to account for the possibility of unexpected developments (urgent policy needs, technological changes, political pressure) that could trigger an early revision, but these seem unlikely given the lack of any signals.

(b) Rough figures from sources: The two-year review cycle suggests ~0% probability of a revision in the first 10 months. No source suggests an imminent revision.

(c) Probability precision: The difference between 5% and 1% is significant. Given the complete absence of signals and the short timeframe, this should be in the low single digits.

(d) Rate of upsets: In EU regulatory processes, unexpected accelerations are rare but not impossible. However, multi-stakeholder consultation processes have institutional inertia that makes rapid changes difficult. I estimate perhaps a 2-5% chance of unexpected developments forcing an early revision.

**Calibration factors pushing probability down:**
- No announcement or indication of work on a revised draft
- Only 80 days remaining
- Two-year review cycle suggests 2027
- Recent focus on implementation, not revision

**Calibration factors pushing probability up:**
- The Code is new and untested; implementation issues could emerge
- Political pressure from industry or Member States could accelerate changes
- The question only requires a "draft" to be published, not a final revision
- Small possibility of a technical correction or clarification draft

Given the overwhelming evidence against a revision in this timeframe and the lack of any positive signals, but accounting for a small possibility of unexpected developments:
