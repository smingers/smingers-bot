Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
This resolves “Yes” if an official European Commission/EU AI Office webpage (notably the AI Office “Drawing-up a General-Purpose AI Code of Practice” page) publishes a new/revised *draft* of the GPAI Code of Practice after 2026-02-10 and before 2026-05-01, with the draft text accessible.

(a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; date)
Primary/official EU sources (highest weight)
- European Commission policy page / “Contents code GPAI” (digital-strategy.europa.eu; published July 10, 2025): Confirms the GPAI Code of Practice was published (final) and focuses on signatories and implementation (Taskforce). No mention of a near-term revised draft. High quality; but as of 2025-07-10 it’s backward-looking.
- (Implicitly referenced) “Drawing-up a General-Purpose AI Code of Practice” policy page (the resolution’s primary source): Not provided as an excerpt in the packet, but per outside-view research it has not announced/published a revised draft as of today (2026-02-10). Highest quality if it updates.

Legal / professional analyses (secondary; mostly descriptive; moderate weight)
- Kluwer Copyright Blog (date not shown in excerpt; describes 2024-2025 drafting): Notes multiple drafts (2nd/3rd) and that the “third draft is set to be the last draft,” with final expected May 2025 (later became July 2025). Good factual recap, but not a forward-looking signal for a 2026 revised draft.
- IAPP article (2025; “Commission receives final version”): Confirms final version delivery, political reactions, and endorsement steps; does not suggest reopening drafts. Medium-high quality trade press.
- Jones Day (Aug 2025): Client alert summarizing the July 10, 2025 publication; no forward signal of revised drafts. High quality as legal memo; still not predictive.
- JD Supra / Pillsbury memo (2025): Mentions potential delays/simplification rumors around enforcement; explicitly says not publicly confirmed. This is about AI Act timing, not a GPAI code redraft. Moderate quality; partly speculative on delays.
- Crowell & Moring (July 2025): Descriptive of final code; emphasizes voluntary nature; no mention of new drafts. High quality as legal memo.
- Multiple Lexology / Mondaq / Times of Malta explainers (Sep 2025–Jan 2026): Summarize that the Code exists, is voluntary, and is subject to periodic review (often “every two years”). The Lexology “Winter AI wrap” (Jan 19, 2026) is notable: it explicitly says *another* “draft Code of Practice on transparency of AI-generated content” had further drafts expected in March 2026—however that is a different code (Article 50), not the GPAI code. Moderate quality; helpful context but easy to misapply.

AskNews articles (Feb 9–10, 2026) (low relevance to GPAI code revision)
- A cluster of articles on the Commission’s antitrust action vs Meta over WhatsApp excluding third-party AI assistants: timely and likely accurate on competition enforcement, but not about revising the GPAI Code of Practice. Low direct relevance to the resolution criteria.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted factors tied to resolution)
Strong evidence (pushes toward “No” / low probability)
- Institutional/structural timing: The GPAI Code of Practice was finalized/published July 2025 and described as subject to review on a ~two-year cycle. That cadence strongly implies no revised *draft* in the 2026-02 to 2026-05 window. (Structural; hard to change quickly.)
- Absence of official signals: None of the official Commission materials provided (nor the secondary summaries) indicate an active process to publish a revised GPAI draft in early 2026. (Negative evidence, but consistent across multiple sources.)

Moderate evidence (slightly ambiguous; small upward pull at most)
- Broader “simplification/delay” discourse around AI Act implementation (JD Supra / Lexology wrap): If the Commission truly moved to “simplify” obligations, it could (in principle) motivate an updated GPAI code. But these items either (i) are unconfirmed, or (ii) do not specifically target the GPAI code text, and (iii) would still require process time. (Indirect causal link.)

Weak evidence (minimal impact)
- Competition enforcement intensity in AI-adjacent markets (Meta/WhatsApp case): Shows the Commission is active in AI, but does not imply reopening a voluntary GPAI compliance code. (Speculative connection.)

Net: The evidentiary balance remains decisively against a revised GPAI draft being published in the next ~80 days.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time remaining: 80 days (from 2026-02-10 to 2026-05-01).
- If timeframe were halved (~40 days): Probability would drop further because even a “quick” consultation-style draft release would likely require visible pre-steps (announcement, call for feedback, etc.).
- If timeframe were doubled (~160 days): Probability would rise somewhat, mainly because there’d be enough time for the Commission/AI Office to react to implementation friction and still publish a “revised draft” (even without finalizing it). But within 80 days, the window is tight.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment vs outside-view base rate)
Outside-view base rate (given): 3%.

Status quo if nothing changes: The Commission continues implementing and operationalizing the existing July 2025 GPAI Code (Taskforce, guidance, templates), with substantive revision deferred to the stated biennial review rhythm—so “No.”

Paths to “Yes” within the window (what would have to happen)
- The AI Office decides that early implementation experience (Aug 2025–Feb 2026) revealed enough ambiguity or burden that a revised draft must be issued immediately (e.g., clarifying systemic-risk reporting, documentation, or copyright measures).
- A political/legislative “omnibus simplification” package explicitly triggers a need to realign the voluntary code quickly, prompting publication of a revised draft.
- A narrow technical revision is issued as a “revised draft” (e.g., correcting commitments, annexes, or documentation forms) rather than waiting for a full review.

Why these do not (yet) outweigh the base rate
- No direct, dated, official forward guidance indicates an imminent “revised draft” of the GPAI code.
- The Commission already has other code-of-practice workstreams (e.g., AI content transparency) with known draft cycles into March 2026; this may absorb bandwidth rather than accelerate GPAI redrafting.
- Given the EU process style, a “new draft version” typically comes with visible preparatory steps; none are in the provided materials as of opening day.

Therefore I make only a very small adjustment (if any) from 3%: the only upward pressure is the general “simplification/delay” chatter and the general possibility of a narrow corrective draft. But the short window and lack of signals dominate.

Probability calibration
- Outside view: 3%
- Inside-view nudges:
  - +0.5% for the (non-zero) chance of a narrow corrective/clarificatory “revised draft” being posted without a long process (especially if the AI Office wants to quickly clarify interpretation issues for signatories).
  - -0.5% for the 80-day constraint and lack of any explicit “forthcoming revised draft” indicators in official channels as of today.
Net inside view: stays at 3%.

Checklist:
1) Criteria/time window check: Revised/new *draft* GPAI code published on official EU AI Office/Commission page after 2026-02-10 and before 2026-05-01.
2) Outside view base rate used: 3%.
3) Consistency line: 3 out of 100 times, the AI Office publishes a revised/new draft of the GPAI code in this 80-day window.
4) Key evidence (3–5):
   - GPAI Code published July 10, 2025; described as final; review cycle ~every two years.
   - No official mention of an imminent revised GPAI draft in provided EU materials.
   - Other EU AI “codes of practice” (content transparency) have draft activity in March 2026, suggesting GPAI revision is not the current draft priority.
   - 80-day window is very short for EU multi-stakeholder redrafting absent an announced trigger.
5) Blind spot: A politically driven “AI Act simplification” package could force quick publication of a revised GPAI draft as a signaling move; that would push probability up materially (perhaps into the 10–20% range).
6) Status quo outcome: No revised draft; implementation proceeds under the July 2025 code until a later scheduled review.

Probability: 3%
