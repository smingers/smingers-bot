Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis

1) **European Commission policy page: “Drawing-up a General-Purpose AI Code of Practice” (official EC / AI Office page; undated but describes 2024–2025 process)**
- **What it says (facts):** The Code was developed via an *iterative drafting process* with ~1000 stakeholders, with several drafting rounds “until the publication of the Code.” Notes parallel workstreams (e.g., training data summary template).
- **What it implies (interpretation):** Emphasizes iteration *pre-publication*; does not indicate an *ongoing* near-term revision cycle after the Code’s publication.
- **Quality:** Very high (primary source). Limited forward-looking signal about revised drafts.

2) **EC library page: “Third Draft of the General-Purpose AI Code of Practice published…” (official EC; March 2025)**
- **What it says (facts):** Third draft published; described as “the last drafting round,” with final Code expected in May 2025 after feedback (deadline March 30, 2025). Mentions second draft (Dec 19, 2024).
- **Quality:** Very high (primary source). Strong evidence that the drafting cadence was designed to end in spring/summer 2025.

3) **Jones Day alert (July/Aug 2025; secondary legal commentary)**
- **What it says (facts as reported):** EC published the GPAI Code of Practice on July 10, 2025; mentions complementary guidance and training-data summary template; endorsement expected around early Aug 2025.
- **Quality:** Medium (reputable law firm, but not primary). Useful corroboration of timeline; weak on predicting new drafts.

4) **code-of-practice.ai (unofficial convenience site)**
- **What it says (facts):** Claims to present the final version dated 10/07/2025; urges readers to refer to official PDFs.
- **Quality:** Low-to-medium (explicitly unofficial). Confirms existence/structure but should not be used for official-status inference.

5) **InsidePrivacy (Dec 18, 2025; legal blog)**
- **What it says (facts as reported):** Commission launched a Dec 2025–Jan 2026 consultation on machine-readable “reservation of rights” protocols; notes outputs reviewed “at least every two years” in line with Code updates.
- **Quality:** Medium (secondary, but specific and plausibly sourced). Important because it suggests *future* updates, but not necessarily within the next ~80 days.

6) **Taylor Wessing (Apr 29, 2025; legal commentary)**
- **What it says (facts as reported):** Third draft stage; final expected May 2025; lobbying; rumors of simplification.
- **Quality:** Medium. Mostly confirms the 2025 drafting arc; not strong evidence about 2026 revision drafts.

7) **Wired-gov.net (July 2025; news summary site)**
- **What it says (facts as reported):** Final version released; sign-up deadline; signatories listed Aug 1, 2025; enforcement focus on signatories.
- **Quality:** Medium-low (not the canonical source). Corroborative only.

8) **Agent report (compiled chronology through Feb 2026; mixed sourcing, some unverifiable links)**
- **What it says (facts/claims):** Lists draft versions (1st/2nd/3rd) and final July 10, 2025; mentions minor corrigenda/vademecum; emphasizes “two-year review” language and no new draft announced as of Feb 2026.
- **Quality:** Mixed. The high-level conclusion (no announced revised draft as of Feb 2026; update cadence ~2 years) fits other sources. But some specific early-draft URLs/dates look weakly evidenced; I treat those details cautiously.

**Net from sources:** Strong evidence the Code was finalized in mid-2025, with a *review/update* concept on a multi-year cadence; no primary-source indication of a revised draft scheduled for Feb–Apr 2026.

### (b) Reference class analysis

Plausible reference classes:

1) **EU “code of practice” instruments tied to major digital regulation** (e.g., DSA Codes of Conduct/Practice, Commission guidelines/codes that are co-regulatory or quasi-voluntary).
- **Suitability:** High. These tend to have: (i) intense drafting/consultation, (ii) a “final” release, (iii) infrequent substantial revisions (often yearly-plus), plus occasional corrigenda/FAQs.

2) **EU Commission guidance documents / Q&As for newly applicable rules**
- **Suitability:** Medium. These are updated more frequently than codes, but the question is specifically about a *revised draft of the Code*, not ancillary guidance.

3) **Technical protocol consultations leading to updates**
- **Suitability:** Medium-low for this question. Even if the Commission updates an associated list/standard, it may not reopen the Code itself as a “revised draft” within the short window.

**Most suitable reference class:** (1) EU regulatory codes of practice that have a “final” state and periodic review. Those instruments rarely re-enter “draft” status within a couple of months unless there is a major error, political reset, or implementation crisis.

---

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Forecast window:** From **2026-02-10** to **2026-05-01** = ~**80 days** (~2.6 months).
- **Process timing constraints (outside view):** Publishing a *revised/new draft* generally requires (i) internal decision to revise, (ii) drafting, (iii) often a consultation wrapper and translation/legal checks. Even “fast” EU consultation cycles commonly run several weeks, then take additional time to synthesize feedback.
- **Historical pattern suggested by the sources:** Drafting rounds occurred over months (late 2024 → March 2025) with a planned finalization (mid-2025). That cadence suggests revisions are not routine on a sub-quarterly basis.

Given only ~80 days, the base-rate expectation is that **no revised draft** will be published unless something exceptional is already in motion.

### (d) Justification (outside view)

**Status quo if nothing changes:** No revised draft is published; the July 2025 Code stands, supplemented by guidance/templates and separate consultations.

**What would drive “Yes” within 80 days (outside view pathways):**
- A significant implementation problem emerges (e.g., major ambiguity, backlash, or enforcement/practical infeasibility) prompting the AI Office to reopen the Code text.
- A political decision to “simplify” or recalibrate GPAI obligations in a way that the Code must reflect quickly.
- The Dec 2025–Jan 2026 copyright-protocol consultation results are incorporated into a revised Code draft rapidly (as opposed to a separate list/guidance document). This is plausible in principle, but the sources more strongly suggest the output is a **list of solutions** reviewed over time, not necessarily an immediate Code rewrite.

**What drives “No”:**
- Institutional inertia plus the presence of alternative instruments (guidelines, templates, lists of protocols) that can be updated without reopening the Code.
- The “at least every two years” review cadence, pointing toward 2027-ish rather than spring 2026.
- Short time remaining: even if internal work began, public posting of an explicitly labeled “revised/new draft” by May 1 is a tight schedule.

**Outside-view takeaway:** In similar EU governance tools, *post-final* revised drafts within a ~3-month window are uncommon. The most likely near-term publications are clarifications, FAQs, protocol lists, or guidance—often not labeled as a revised Code “draft.”

Outside view calibration:

- **Anchor/base rate:** For a “final” EU code of practice to be reissued as an explicitly labeled *revised draft* within ~1 quarter: I’d place a rough base rate around **~10%** (order-of-magnitude: “unlikely but not crazy”).
- **Adjustments from evidence:** Sources lean against imminent revision (finalized mid-2025; multi-year review language; no announcement as of Feb 2026) → push downward modestly.
- **Upset factor:** EU tech regulation sometimes generates rapid political/industry pushback; unexpected “mini-reopens” can happen. Keep a non-trivial tail risk.

Net calibrated outside-view probability lands in the low teens.

Outside View Prediction:
**11.8%**
