Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most relevant first)

1. European Commission “Drawing-up a General-Purpose AI Code of Practice” page (primary, last updated July 2025).  
   Fact: says third draft was the final draft and the Code was published 10 Jul 2025; reviews will take place “at least every two years.”  
   Quality: very strong, official.  Mostly factual, almost no opinion.

2. Kluwer Copyright Blog, 15 Mar 2025.  
   Fact: describes second and third drafts; third draft called the “last draft”, feedback closed 30 Mar 2025.  
   Opinion: authors think clarity still lacking.  
   Quality: good legal commentary; facts corroborated elsewhere.

3. Jones Day client alert, 11 Jul 2025.  
   Fact: confirms publication of the final Code; endorsement expected 02 Aug 2025; contains timetable for related guidance.  
   Quality: reputable law-firm secondary source.

4. Crowell & Moring alert, 17 Jul 2025.  
   Fact: again confirms final Code release, voluntary nature, no mention of further drafts.  
   Quality: good secondary source.

5. Lexology Winter AI wrap, 19 Jan 2026.  
   Fact: notes Commission consultation on copyright “reservation of rights” protocols (Dec 2025 – Jan 2026) and separate transparency-of-AI-content code expected Mar-Jun 2026.  No hint of reopening GPAI Code.  
   Quality: medium; aggregation of several primary notices.

6. AskNews and other Feb 2026 antitrust articles about Meta/WhatsApp.  
   Fact: Commission pursuing interim competition measures against Meta.  
   Relevance: tangential; shows the AI Office/Commission are busy but gives no evidence of a new GPAI code draft.  
   Quality: decent journalism but low relevance to resolution criteria.

No source after July 2025 reports any plan, leaked text, or consultation for a “revised/new draft” of the GPAI Code of Practice.  All recent Commission communications deal with guidance, templates or entirely separate codes (e.g., Article 50 transparency code).

(b) Evidence analysis (using weighting rubric)

Strong evidence (against “Yes”):
• Final Code formally published 10 Jul 2025 and labelled “final”; Commission page and multiple independent legal briefings concur.  
• Code’s own text: review cycle of “at least every two years,” implying next substantive iteration ≈ 2027, well after 1 May 2026.

Moderate evidence (some room for “Yes”):
• Commission can act quickly when under political pressure (e.g., Digital Services Act codes, antitrust interim measures).  If the Dec 2025 copyright consultation produced game-changing feedback, an emergency patch could be issued, though nothing has been announced.  
• Full enforcement (fines) for GPAI systemic-risk models starts 2 Aug 2026; Commission might want last-minute tweaks before that date.  80-day window is still tight.

Weak evidence (minimal impact):
• Press speculation about “simplification” of GPAI rules in May 2025 that never materialised.  
• Current Meta antitrust battle shows Commission reactivity but is unrelated to GPAI Code text.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time until resolution: ~80 days.  Typical EU code drafting + translation + inter-service consultation seldom concludes in <90 days once publicly visible.  If the window were doubled to 160 days, my probability would rise modestly (to ~15 %).  If halved to 40 days, I’d drop it to ~5 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view update  
Outside-view base rate for a fresh draft within a quarter of the window: 11.8 %.  
Updates downward: strong structural signal (biennial review clause), absence of any preparatory announcement, and procedural lead-times → –5 pp.  
Updates upward: possibility that copyright-protocol consultation results are folded into the Code before fines bite → +2 pp.  
Net inside-view probability: 11.8 % – 5 % + 2 % ≈ 9 %.

Probability calibration  
“I expect that in roughly 9 out of 100 similar 80-day periods, the AI Office would publish a revised draft of the GPAI Code of Practice.”

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “By 1 May 2026 will the EU AI Office post a new draft labelled as such of the GPAI Code?” ✔  
2. Base rate stated (11.8 %). ✔  
3. Consistency line – see calibration line above. ✔  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each)  
   • Final Code published 10 Jul 2025, labelled “final”.  
   • Code text: next review at least every two years.  
   • No Commission notice of new draft as of 10 Feb 2026.  
   • EU drafting cycles rarely complete <3 months.  
5. Blind-spot – emergency political deal forces rapid “patch” draft in March 2026. Could raise probability to ~30 %.  
6. Status-quo outcome is “No”; short horizon favours status-quo. ✔

Probability: 9%
