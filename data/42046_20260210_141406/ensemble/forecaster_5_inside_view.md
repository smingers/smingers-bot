Analysis:
1. Source analysis (chronological, most relevant first)
   • EU digital-strategy policy page (primary, last updated 10 Jul 2025).  Fact: “final” Code of Practice published; three chapters; voluntary.  No reference to further drafts.  High quality.  
   • Kluwer Copyright Blog, 14 Apr 2025.  Fact: second & third drafts, consultation closed 30 Mar 2025; third draft described as the “last” draft.  Commentary notes remaining gaps.  Secondary but reputable.  
   • Jones Day client alert, 10 Jul 2025.  Confirms publication of final Code; details structure and coming adequacy decision 2 Aug 2025.  No hint of re-opening.  Secondary, professional.  
   • AI Office Q&A (annex to Code, 10 Jul 2025).  States: “The Code will be reviewed at least every two years.”  Primary, authoritative.  
   • Lexology “Winter AI wrap”, 19 Jan 2026.  Mentions new Article 50 transparency code drafts for Mar 2026, but nothing about revising the GPAI Code of Practice.  Secondary, legal trade press.  
   • All AskNews hits 9-10 Feb 2026 concern Meta/WhatsApp antitrust; irrelevant to GPAI Code.  No signal.  

   Opinion separation: only the Kluwer and Lexology pieces express views (“still lacks clarity”, “window for simplification”); none of those opinions claim a revision is imminent.

2. Evidence analysis (relative weight)
   Strong evidence (- toward “No”)
     – Official EU text and Q&A label July 2025 Code “final” and set a two-year review cycle.  
     – No Commission/AI Office consultation notice, press release, or draft timetable since July 2025.  
     – Historic pattern for EU digital Codes of Practice: 1st revision ≥2 years after initial adoption (disinformation, cloud switching, etc.).  

   Moderate evidence (+/- tiny)
     – Legal blogs note unresolved issues and industry push-back, which could motivate tweaks, but do not report concrete steps.  
     – AI Act obligations bite 2 Aug 2026; Commission might want stability, not new drafts, in the run-up to enforcement.  

   Weak evidence (+ toward “Yes”)
     – Generic statement that the Code “will be reviewed every two years” leaves logical room for an earlier partial update—purely theoretical.  

   Net effect: evidence overwhelmingly supports the status-quo “No”.

3. Timeframe analysis
   Time left until deadline: 80 days (~11 weeks).  A fresh draft would first require (i) mandate, (ii) multistakeholder working group, (iii) drafting, (iv) publication.  None of these steps have started publicly.  
   If the window were doubled (to 160 days) probability would rise only marginally (to perhaps 4 %).  If halved (~40 days) probability would drop close to 1 %.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment
   Starting outside-view base rate (Codes revised within 12 mo of final): 2.3 %.  
   • +0.2 pp for potential political pressure from big model providers & looming enforcement (moderate evidence).  
   • –0.3 pp for lack of any preparatory signal in past seven months (strong evidence).  
   • +0.3 pp “unknown-unknown” cushion against over-confidence.  
   Final inside view ≈ 2.5 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that 2–3 times out of 100 the AI Office will publish a new draft of the GPAI Code before 1 May 2026.”  
Rounded point estimate: 2 %.

Checklist:
1. Title paraphrase: “Between 10 Feb 2026 and 1 May 2026, will the EU AI Office publish a clearly-labelled new draft of the GPAI Code?”  
2. Base rate used: 2.3 % (no Code revised within 1 yr historically).  
3. Consistency line: “2 out of 100 times, a revised GPAI Code draft appears by 1 May 2026.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   – Official July 2025 text marked “final”; review cycle ≥2 yrs.  
   – Zero Commission consultations/press releases on a revision.  
   – Historical Codes revised only after ≥30 months.  
   – Only 80 days remain.  
5. Blind-spot: A behind-the-scenes political deal forces rapid amendment (e.g., systemic-risk chapter) and a draft appears in April 2026.  Would push probability toward 25 %.  
6. Status-quo outcome is “No”; short timeframe favours inertia.

Probability: 2%
