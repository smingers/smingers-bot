Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. EU “Drawing-up a General-Purpose AI Code of Practice” page (Commission, undated but updated through mid-2025).  Factual, primary.  Describes the initial multistakeholder drafting process, confirms that three virtual drafting rounds preceded publication.  No mention of post-July-2025 revision plans.  Very high reliability.  
2. “Third Draft of the General-Purpose AI Code of Practice published …” (Commission news item, 11 Mar 2025).  Primary.  Announces the 3rd draft and says it is the “last drafting round” with a final code expected in May 2025.  High reliability, no opinion.  
3. Jones Day client alert, 10 Jul 2025.  Secondary but professionally vetted.  States that the Commission published the final Code on that date; discusses complementary guidance.  Does not signal further drafts.  Moderately high reliability (law-firm brief).  
4. Code-of-Practice.ai mirror site (unofficial, July 2025).  Useful for document text but not authoritative for procedural status; lower weight.  
5. Covington “Inside Privacy” post, 18 Dec 2025.  Secondary.  Announces consultations on copyright protocols, notes that the list will be “reviewed regularly—at least every two years—in line with updates to the GPAI Code”.  Indicates that updates are expected but on a two-year cadence, not immediately.  Reasonably reliable.  
6. Taylor Wessing blog, 29 Apr 2025.  Secondary, pre-final.  Confirms third draft status; no forecast of later revisions.  Moderate reliability.  
7. Wired-Gov newsletter, 25 Jul 2025.  Secondary.  Confirms “final version” language, sign-up deadline.  Moderate reliability.  
8. Agent report: collates above plus practitioner commentary; reconstructs dates for drafts 1–3, final, and minor corrigenda.  Provides historical sequence and notes the two-year review clause.  Some inference, but factual backbone matches primary sources.

Across the corpus there is no record of any revised/new draft after 10 Jul 2025, and the only official indication of future change is the built-in “review every two years”.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
1. EU voluntary “codes of practice/conduct” in the digital sphere (Disinformation Code 2018→revised 2022; Online Advertising Code 2011→revised 2018; Cloud Switching Code 2017→revised 2020).  Typical interval between final adoption and first formal revision: 30-60 months.  
2. EU soft-law guidance documents under new tech legislation (NIS-2, DSA, DMA): draft → final, then corrigenda/FAQs within 1 year but no new full draft.  
Class 1 captures the same “Code of Practice” instrument and Commission stewardship.  I take it as the main reference class.

Observed base rate: 3 codes, 0 instances of a completely new draft within the first 12 months after a final version; first revision always >2 years.  Base-rate probability ≈0-5 % for a revision inside 12 months.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time remaining until question closes: 80 days (10 Feb→1 May 2026).  The final Code has been in force for 7 months.  Historically (reference class) the Commission has never launched a new draft inside such a narrow post-final window; preparatory stakeholder scoping alone usually takes ≥3 months before a text appears.

(d) Justification  
Status quo if nothing changes = “No” (no revised draft).  
To flip to “Yes”, the AI Office would have to: (1) decide that a revision is urgent before the AI Act’s GPAI obligations bite on 2 Aug 2026; (2) reopen a multistakeholder drafting process; (3) publish a text labelled “draft”.  Signals that could foreshadow this—press releases, consultation notices—do not exist in the public record up to today.  The only active file (copyright-protocol list) is bounded and will result in a “list of agreed solutions”, not a code rewrite.  

Expert expectation: legal commentaries consistently speak of the Code being “final” and of a two-year review cycle, implying next full draft in 2027 at the earliest.

Outside view calibration:

Baseline (reference class) chance of a revised draft within 12 months of final: 3 %.  
Adjustments:  
• Only 80 days left (≈22 % of the 12-month window) → down-weight by ≈4× → 0.8 %.  
• High political salience of frontier AI could raise likelihood slightly; say +0.4 pp.  
• Unknown unknowns / upset factor in EU policy (~1 % additive to guard against over-confidence).  

0.8 % + 0.4 % + 1 % ≈ 2.2 %.  Round to two decimals for clarity: 2.0–2.5 % feels plausible.  I adopt 2.3 %.

Outside View Prediction:
2.3 %
