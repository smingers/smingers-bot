Analysis:
The key is to monitor whether, after 10 Feb 2026, the EU AI Office (or another official European Commission channel) posts a new file or webpage explicitly labelled as a “draft” or “consultation draft” of the General-Purpose AI Code of Practice. Useful signals include press releases, “Have your say” consultations, and policy news updates. Therefore, searches should combine terms like “AI Office”, “general-purpose AI”, “code of practice”, “draft”, “revised”, “update”, and the 2026 timeframe.
