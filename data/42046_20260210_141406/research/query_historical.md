Analysis:
To judge the likelihood of another draft, I first need a timeline of everything the Commission has already released. Key pieces of context:  
• Date and content of the first GPAI Code of Practice draft (to see how recently it appeared and whether the Commission labelled it “draft 1,” “version 1.0,” etc.).  
• Evidence of any earlier iterations or updates—European Commission press releases, AI Office blogposts, stakeholder consultation pages, or PDF filenames that include version numbers.  
• Statements from Commission officials or consultation documents hinting at forthcoming “revised” or “second” drafts.  
Knowing how often the EU typically iterates on comparable documents (e.g., the EU Cloud Code of Conduct) could also help, but the key is identifying any past pattern of releasing successive drafts in short order. Therefore the most relevant historical context is the publication history of the GPAI code of practice itself and any official EU communications about future revisions.
