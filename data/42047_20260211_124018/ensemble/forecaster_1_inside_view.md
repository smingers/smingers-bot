## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Multiple independent forecasts converging on $2.90-$3.00 annual average:** EIA ($2.91), GasBuddy ($2.97) - both authoritative sources with clear methodologies
2. **GasBuddy specific monthly forecast: May 2026 at $3.12/gal** - Direct, identified expert forecast for month immediately after April, suggesting April in $3.00-$3.15 range
3. **Structural supply/demand fundamentals:** EIA projects global production exceeding demand through 2027, creating downward pressure on prices
4. **Current actual price trajectory:** January 2026 actual $2.809/gal → Early February $2.90/gal, establishing baseline

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Seasonal pattern for April:** Historical Jan→Apr increase typically $0.20-$0.35 (excluding anomalies), driven by summer-blend transition
2. **Expert commentary on spring dynamics:** De Haan specifically notes April summer-blend switch in Northeast and spring prices potentially pushing above $3.00
3. **Downward revision in forecasts:** EIA revised 2026 forecast from $3.07 (May 2025) to $2.91 (Feb 2026), indicating improving supply conditions
4. **Current crude oil environment:** Brent at $67/bbl in January, forecast $58/bbl annual average - lower than 2024-2025 levels

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Iran geopolitical tensions:** Mentioned in STEO but not quantified; could push prices up but speculative
2. **California refinery shutdown in April:** Mentioned by De Haan but regional impact, not national
3. **Weather impacts:** Winter Storm Fern affected natural gas, but gasoline impact unclear

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 79 days (February 11 to April 30, 2026) - approximately 2.5 months

**Current Position:** 
- January 2026: $2.809/gal (actual)
- Early February 2026: ~$2.90/gal (trending up)
- April 2026: Target month (49 days from now to April 1, 79 days to April 30)

**If Timeframe Halved (40 days - mid-March):**
- Would predict mid-point of current trend: $2.95-$3.00/gal
- Less time for seasonal summer-blend transition to fully impact prices
- Reduced uncertainty, narrower distribution

**If Timeframe Doubled (160 days - mid-July):**
- Would predict post-spring peak decline: $2.85-$2.95/gal based on GasBuddy forecast of $2.83 after June
- Greater uncertainty due to summer driving season volatility
- Wider distribution to account for geopolitical and supply disruptions

**April-Specific Dynamics:**
- April is transition month: refineries switch to summer-blend gasoline (more expensive)
- Historically shows moderate increases from January baseline
- GasBuddy forecasts May at $3.12, suggesting April likely $3.00-$3.10 as buildup month

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Anchoring:**
- Historical April mean (2014-2025): $2.901/gal, median $2.798/gal
- Recent Aprils (2023-2025): $3.171-$3.611/gal, mean $3.462/gal
- **Current environment more similar to 2015-2021 period ($2.11-$2.86 range) than 2022-2024 spike period**

**Key Factors Shifting Prediction:**

1. **GasBuddy May 2026 forecast of $3.12/gal (Strong Evidence):** This is the most direct piece of evidence. If May is $3.12 (the peak month), April should be slightly lower as the buildup month. Historical pattern shows April typically 2-5 cents below May peak. **This suggests April range of $3.05-$3.12.**

2. **Current trajectory from $2.809 (Jan) to $2.90 (early Feb) (Strong Evidence):** Already showing $0.09 increase in first 10 days of February. Extrapolating this momentum: $2.90 + typical seasonal increase of $0.15-$0.25 = **$3.05-$3.15 for April.**

3. **Expert commentary on spring dynamics (Moderate Evidence):** De Haan specifically states "potentially pushing the national average above $3.00 per gallon for part of the spring" and notes April summer-blend transition. **This supports April in $3.00-$3.15 range.**

4. **EIA annual forecast of $2.91/gal (Strong Evidence):** If annual average is $2.91, and spring months (April-May) are typically above average, April should be $3.00-$3.15 to balance against lower winter/fall months.

**Reconciling Evidence:**
- GasBuddy May forecast ($3.12) + April as buildup month = **$3.05-$3.12**
- Current price ($2.90) + seasonal increase ($0.15-$0.25) = **$3.05-$3.15**
- EIA annual average ($2.91) + spring premium = **$3.00-$3.10**
- Expert commentary = **Above $3.00 in spring**

**Central Estimate: $3.05-$3.10/gal**

**Uncertainty Considerations:**
- 2.5 months allows for supply disruptions (Iran, refineries)
- Historical April std dev of $0.663 suggests wide potential range
- But current fundamentals (excess supply, lower crude) limit upside
- Downside limited by seasonal transition costs and current upward momentum

**Distribution Reasoning:**
- **Median (50th percentile): $3.08** - midpoint of $3.05-$3.10 central estimate
- **10th percentile: $2.75** - scenario where demand collapses, geopolitical tensions ease dramatically, or production surges. Below current February price but possible if trend reverses.
- **90th percentile: $3.45** - scenario where Iran tensions escalate, refinery disruptions occur, or demand spikes. Below 2024 April ($3.61) but above GasBuddy's "low $3.20s" spring peak estimate.
- **Interquartile range (20th-80th): $2.90-$3.25** - captures realistic range around central estimate

Distribution calibration:

**Starting Point:** Outside view suggested 10th: $2.65, median: $3.025, 90th: $3.40

**Adjustments Based on Inside View:**

1. **Upward shift in central tendency:** GasBuddy's specific May forecast of $3.12 and expert commentary about spring prices above $3.00 provide strong evidence that April will be in $3.05-$3.12 range, not $2.95-$3.10 as outside view suggested.

2. **Narrowing of distribution:** The convergence of multiple independent forecasts (EIA $2.91 annual, GasBuddy $2.97 annual, May $3.12) and clear current trajectory reduces uncertainty compared to purely historical reference class.

3. **Lower bound adjustment:** Current price already at $2.90 and trending up with 79 days to go. Unlikely to drop below $2.70 absent major shock. Raise 10th percentile from $2.65 to $2.75.

4. **Upper bound adjustment:** Current fundamentals (excess supply, lower crude at $58/bbl forecast) and lack of major disruption signals suggest 90th percentile around $3.45 is appropriate, slightly above GasBuddy's "low $3.20s" spring peak to account for tail risk.

**Final Distribution:**
- Centers around $3.08 (between current $2.90 and May forecast $3.12)
- 10th-90th range of $2.75-$3.45 ($0.70 spread) captures realistic uncertainty
- Interquartile range $2.90-$3.25 reflects high-probability outcomes
- Consistent with all major forecasts and current trajectory

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** US national average retail price for regular gasoline in April 2026 (monthly average), in USD/gallon, per EIA data.

2. **Outside view base rate:** Historical April mean $2.90, median $2.80, with 10th-90th range of $2.65-$3.40. **My final prediction shifts upward (median $3.08 vs $3.03) based on strong convergent evidence from GasBuddy May forecast ($3.12), current trajectory ($2.90 and rising), and expert commentary about spring prices above $3.00.**

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = $3.08; mean ≈ $3.07; this aligns with GasBuddy's May forecast of $3.12 (April as buildup month), current upward trajectory from $2.90, and EIA annual average of $2.91 (spring months above average).

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - GasBuddy forecasts May 2026 at $3.12/gal (April should be $3.05-$3.12 as buildup)
   - Current price $2.90 in early February, up from $2.809 in January, showing upward momentum
   - Expert De Haan states spring prices will push above $3.00 with April summer-blend transition
   - EIA annual forecast $2.91/gal requires spring months above average
   - Historical Jan→Apr seasonal increase typically $0.20-$0.35

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Major geopolitical escalation (Iran conflict intensifies) or significant refinery disruptions could push prices to $3.60-$3.80 range, making my 90th percentile of $3.45 look too conservative. Alternatively, sudden demand collapse or OPEC production surge could drop prices to $2.50-$2.60, making my 10th percentile of $2.75 too high. **Most likely miss: Upward, if spring demand exceeds expectations.**

6. **Status quo outcome:** Current price is $2.90 and rising. If nothing changed, April would be around $2.90-$2.95. However, seasonal transition to summer-blend and historical patterns strongly suggest increase to $3.05-$3.15. **My prediction appropriately reflects expected seasonal change, not pure status quo.**

7. **Technicalities:** Values strictly increasing: 2.75 < 2.90 < 3.00 < 3.08 < 3.25 < 3.45. Units in USD/gallon as requested. All values within bounds (1.5-7.5, open).
