## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **April gasoline prices (2014-2025):** Most directly relevant - same month, accounts for seasonal patterns
   - April values: 2014: $3.661, 2015: $2.469, 2016: $2.113, 2017: $2.417, 2018: $2.757, 2019: $2.798, 2020: $1.841, 2021: $2.858, 2022: $4.109, 2023: $3.603, 2024: $3.611, 2025: $3.171
   - Mean: $2.901, Median: $2.798, Std Dev: $0.663

2. **Recent monthly prices (2024-2026):** Captures current price environment
   - Range: $2.809 (Jan 2026) to $3.611 (Apr 2024)
   - Trend: Generally declining from 2024 levels

3. **Q2 monthly prices historically:** Broader seasonal context
   - April-June typically show slight increases due to summer driving season demand

**Selected Reference Class:** April historical prices (2014-2025) with heavy weighting toward recent years (2023-2026), as they better reflect current market conditions and crude oil price environment.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 79 days from today (Feb 11, 2026) to April 30, 2026 (when April average is finalized)

**Current Position:** 
- January 2026 actual: $2.809/gal
- Early February 2026: ~$2.90/gal (trending up from January)
- Time to April: ~2.5 months

**Historical Patterns (Jan→Apr changes):**
- 2014: +$0.348, 2015: +$0.353, 2016: +$0.164, 2017: +$0.068, 2018: +$0.202
- 2019: +$0.550, 2020: -$0.707 (COVID), 2021: +$0.524, 2022: +$0.794, 2023: +$0.264
- 2024: +$0.536, 2025: +$0.095

Excluding 2020 (COVID anomaly) and 2022 (Ukraine war spike), typical Jan→Apr increase: $0.20-$0.35

**Seasonal Pattern:** April typically sees moderate increases from January due to:
- Refinery maintenance transitions
- Summer blend requirements
- Anticipation of summer driving demand

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate from Historical Aprils:**
- Recent April prices (2023-2025): $3.171-$3.611, mean ~$3.46
- Full historical Aprils (2014-2025): mean $2.901, median $2.798

**Current Market Context:**
- January 2026 actual: $2.809/gal (lowest January since 2021)
- Early February trending: ~$2.90/gal
- EIA 2026 annual forecast: $2.91/gal (down from May 2025 forecast of $3.07/gal)
- Crude oil: Brent at $67/bbl in Jan 2026, forecast $58/bbl annual average
- EIA expects production to exceed demand, pushing prices down

**Directional Indicators:**
- Current prices significantly below 2023-2024 levels
- Downward revision in EIA forecasts (from $3.07 to $2.91 annual)
- Lower crude oil price environment
- Typical Jan→Apr seasonal increase: $0.20-$0.35

**Expected April 2026 Range:**
Starting from January 2026 actual of $2.809:
- Minimal seasonal increase scenario: $2.809 + $0.10 = $2.91
- Moderate seasonal increase: $2.809 + $0.25 = $3.06
- Strong seasonal increase: $2.809 + $0.40 = $3.21

Given EIA's $2.91 annual forecast and May 2025 STEO's Q2 2026 forecast of $3.16 (likely revised downward in Feb 2026 STEO), central estimate should be $2.95-$3.10 range.

Outside view calibration:

**Distribution Anchoring:**
- Historical April standard deviation: $0.663
- Recent price environment is more stable and lower than historical mean
- Current trajectory from $2.809 (Jan) suggests April in $2.90-$3.15 range most likely

**Tail Considerations:**
- **Lower tail (10th percentile):** Unexpected demand destruction, geopolitical de-escalation, production surge. Historical minimum April was $1.841 (2020 COVID), but absent similar shock, unlikely below $2.60
- **Upper tail (90th percentile):** Supply disruptions (Iran tensions mentioned in STEO), refinery issues, unexpected demand. Historical maximum April was $4.109 (2022), but current fundamentals don't support above $3.40

**Uncertainty Factors:**
- 2.5 months remaining allows for significant events
- Iran tensions noted in STEO could escalate
- Refinery maintenance disruptions possible
- Weather impacts on supply/demand
- Historical April prices show high variance ($0.663 std dev)

**Calibration Strategy:**
- Center distribution around $3.00-$3.05 (between current ~$2.90 and seasonal increase)
- 10th-90th percentile span of ~$0.70-$0.80 to capture realistic uncertainty
- Avoid overconfidence given 2.5-month horizon and historical volatility
