Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**High-Quality, Factual Sources:**

1. **EIA STEO (Feb 10, 2026)**: Official U.S. government forecast projecting 2026 annual average gasoline at $2.91/gal, Brent crude at $58/bbl. Most authoritative source for resolution criteria. Factual projection based on supply/demand modeling.

2. **EIA Weekly Data (Feb 9, 2026)**: Current national average $2.902/gal, up $0.03 from prior week. Official government data, highly reliable, shows current pricing level.

3. **GasBuddy 2026 Forecast (Jan 14, 2026)**: Patrick De Haan (identifiable expert) projects 2026 annual average $2.97/gal, with May peak at $3.12/gal. Methodology includes analysis of 150,000+ stations. Credible industry source.

4. **CBS News/GasBuddy (Jan 6, 2026)**: Same expert (De Haan) forecasts spring prices around $3.20/gal, declining to $2.83 after June. Consistent with later GasBuddy report.

5. **AAA Weekly Data (Feb 9-10, 2026)**: Multiple articles confirm national average $2.89-$2.90/gal, Connecticut $2.89/gal. Reliable tracking data.

**Moderate-Quality Sources:**

6. **Regional Price Reports (Feb 2026)**: Eugene, OR jumped 16.9¢ to $3.35/gal; Riverside County, CA rose to $4.26/gal. Shows West Coast transition to summer-blend gasoline beginning, consistent with De Haan's analysis. Regional but factual.

7. **NJ Gas Analysis (Feb 9, 2026)**: De Haan quoted predicting NJ prices "just over $3.00" by late spring. April switch to summer-blend in Northeast cited. Consistent expert opinion.

8. **Historical Context (Dec 2025)**: National average fell to $2.85/gal in December, lowest since 2020. Establishes recent baseline.

**Low-Relevance Sources:**
- Brazilian gasoline article (2019): Irrelevant geography and timeframe
- UK energy bills: Not applicable to U.S. gasoline

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **EIA official forecast ($2.91 annual average)**: Government agency using comprehensive supply/demand modeling. However, annual averages mask monthly variation; April typically runs above annual mean due to spring demand and summer-blend transition.
- **Current price level ($2.90/gal as of Feb 9)**: Multiple independent sources (EIA, AAA, GasBuddy) confirm. Establishes baseline 50 days before April.
- **Seasonal pattern (summer-blend transition)**: Multiple expert sources (De Haan, EIA) cite April as transition month to more expensive summer gasoline in Northeast/Midwest. Historical data shows April typically +$0.35 above January.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **West Coast price increases already occurring**: Eugene +16.9¢ in one week; California refineries switching early. Suggests seasonal upswing beginning on schedule. However, West Coast ≠ national average.
- **Crude oil supply/demand fundamentals**: EIA projects global supply exceeding demand through 2027, Brent falling from $67 (Jan) to $58 (annual avg). Bearish for prices but countered by seasonal refinery dynamics.
- **GasBuddy spring peak forecast ($3.12-$3.20)**: Expert opinion with clear methodology, but represents peak (likely May) not April average.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Geopolitical risk mentions**: Iran tensions cited but oil prices actually fell recently. Speculative, no concrete impact.
- **Demand weakness**: Some sources note soft demand, but insufficient data to quantify April impact.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeline**: 48 days until April 1; ~75 days until April monthly average is known (early May resolution).

**Current trajectory**: 
- Jan 2026 monthly: $2.809/gal
- Feb 9 weekly: $2.902/gal
- Increase of $0.09 over ~5 weeks = $0.018/week

If this rate continued: April average ≈ $2.90 + (7 weeks × $0.018) = $3.03/gal

**Historical pattern**: Median Jan→Apr increase is $0.35, but 2026 started lower ($2.81 vs historical April baseline). The $0.09 rise already observed represents ~26% of typical seasonal increase.

**If timeframe halved (to mid-March)**: Would predict lower value (~$2.95-$3.00) as full seasonal peak not yet reached.

**If timeframe doubled (to June)**: Would predict decline back toward $2.85-$2.90 as summer-blend transition completes and demand softens post-Memorial Day, consistent with GasBuddy forecast.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view baseline**: 50th percentile at $3.05, based on historical April median ($2.78) plus typical seasonal lift, adjusted for current macro conditions.

**Factors supporting this baseline:**
1. **Summer-blend transition timing**: April is precisely when Northeast/Midwest refineries switch to more expensive summer gasoline. This is structural and predictable.
2. **Current starting point**: At $2.90 in early February, a rise to $3.05-$3.15 by April represents a modest $0.15-$0.25 increase over 8 weeks—well within historical norms.
3. **Expert consensus**: GasBuddy's May peak of $3.12 and spring range of $3.20 implies April likely in $3.00-$3.15 range.

**Factors suggesting slightly lower than outside view:**
1. **Bearish crude fundamentals**: EIA projects oversupply, Brent falling to $58. Current $67 Brent suggests downward pressure.
2. **2026 annual average ($2.91) below historical April levels**: If full-year average is $2.91, April (typically above-average month) likely ranges $2.95-$3.15, not $3.20+.
3. **Weak demand signals**: Multiple sources note soft consumption, though not quantified.

**Factors suggesting slightly higher:**
1. **Refinery dynamics**: California refinery shutdown planned for April could tighten supply.
2. **Current momentum**: Already rising in February, consistent with seasonal pattern beginning.

**Net assessment**: Current factors do NOT render reference class non-analogous. The 2014-2025 April reference class remains valid—no structural breaks, similar supply/demand dynamics. However, the 2026 macro backdrop (oversupply, lower crude) suggests centering slightly below the historical median April value.

## Distribution Calibration

**Anchoring logic:**
- **Median (50th)**: $3.05/gal—represents current price ($2.90) + modest seasonal lift ($0.15), aligned with EIA annual forecast and expert spring predictions.
- **40th percentile**: $2.92/gal—scenario where seasonal lift is minimal (weak demand, rapid crude decline).
- **60th percentile**: $3.18/gal—scenario where seasonal lift is strong (typical refinery tightness, steady demand).
- **20th percentile**: $2.70/gal—requires significant demand shock or crude collapse to $45-50/bbl. Low probability but possible.
- **80th percentile**: $3.50/gal—requires supply disruption (major refinery outage, geopolitical shock). Historical 75th percentile was $3.60.
- **10th/90th percentiles**: $2.45/$3.85—extreme tails for black swan events (recession/war). Wider than outside view to account for 75-day uncertainty window.

**Distribution shape**: Slightly right-skewed (supply shocks easier than demand collapses in this timeframe), but relatively symmetric around $3.05 median.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: U.S. national average retail price for regular gasoline ($/gal) for the calendar month of April 2026, per EIA monthly series.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 50th at $3.05, 10th at $2.40, 90th at $3.80. My inside view shifts median slightly upward to $3.05 (from outside $3.05—actually aligned), narrows 10th to $2.45 (from $2.40) and widens 90th to $3.85 (from $3.80) based on current price momentum and expert forecasts.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = $3.05; approximate mean = $3.08 (slightly right-skewed). This aligns with EIA annual forecast ($2.91) being below April (above-average month), expert spring peak predictions ($3.12-$3.20), and current trajectory from $2.90.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - Current national average $2.90/gal (EIA/AAA, Feb 9) establishes baseline
   - EIA annual forecast $2.91/gal with bearish crude outlook ($58 Brent)
   - Expert consensus (De Haan/GasBuddy) on spring peak $3.12-$3.20 in May
   - April summer-blend transition adds $0.10-$0.20 seasonal premium
   - Historical April median $2.78 + $0.35 seasonal lift = $3.13 baseline

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Major Middle East supply disruption (Iran conflict escalation, Saudi production cut) could spike crude to $85-90/bbl, pushing April gasoline to $3.80-$4.20. This would make my 90th percentile ($3.85) look conservative. Alternatively, sudden U.S. recession could crash demand, pushing prices to $2.30-$2.50 (10th percentile too high).

6. **Status quo outcome**: Current price $2.90/gal. Given 75-day window and typical seasonal volatility (+$0.20-$0.40 in spring), status quo anchor is weak. However, if crude markets remain stable and demand soft, prices could plateau near $2.95-$3.05 rather than spike to $3.20+. My median $3.05 represents modest status quo + seasonal adjustment.

7. **Technicalities**: All percentiles strictly increasing, units in USD/gal as requested, values within 1.5-7.5 bounds (well within—my range is 2.45-3.85).
