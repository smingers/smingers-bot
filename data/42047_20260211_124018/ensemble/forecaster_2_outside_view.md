Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**EIA Historical Data (LeafHandler)**: Official annual averages from the authoritative source. Shows 2025 at $3.097/gal, declining from 2022 peak of $3.951/gal. High quality, current through Feb 10, 2026.

**EIA Weekly Gasoline Update (Feb 10, 2026)**: Most recent weekly data showing Feb 9, 2026 at $2.902/gal, up from $2.867 the prior week. This is current, factual data from the resolution source. Critical baseline.

**EIA STEO (Feb 10, 2026)**: Official forecast projecting 2026 annual average at $2.91/gal. States Brent crude averaged $67/barrel in Jan 2026 but expects annual average of $58/barrel for 2026 due to supply exceeding demand. This is expert opinion from the authoritative agency.

**Rigzone Article (May 2025)**: Historical document reporting May 2025 STEO forecast of $3.16/gal for Q2 2026 (which includes April). However, this is outdated - the Feb 2026 STEO supersedes it with lower projections.

**Agent Report**: Provides complete monthly historical data Jan 2014-Jan 2026. Shows Jan 2026 at $2.809/gal. Notes that April 2026 specific forecast from Feb 2026 STEO is not captured in snippets but annual average is $2.91/gal.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: April prices in recent years (2014-2025)**
From agent report data, April values: 2014: $3.661, 2015: $2.469, 2016: $2.113, 2017: $2.417, 2018: $2.757, 2019: $2.798, 2020: $1.841, 2021: $2.858, 2022: $4.109, 2023: $3.603, 2024: $3.611, 2025: $3.171
Mean: ~$2.95, Std dev: ~$0.65, Range: $1.841-$4.109

**Reference Class 2: Monthly prices in 2025-2026 trend**
2025: Dec $2.894, 2026: Jan $2.809, Feb (week of 2/9) $2.902
Shows recent stabilization around $2.80-$2.90 range

**Reference Class 3: Seasonal patterns within year**
Historically, April tends to be higher than January (spring driving season begins, refineries switch to summer blends). Typical Jan-to-April increase: $0.20-$0.40/gal

**Best choice**: Combination of Reference Classes 2 and 3 - use current 2026 trend as baseline, adjust for typical seasonal pattern.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

Prediction timeframe: ~2.5 months from Feb 11, 2026 to April 2026 (mid-month)

**Current baseline**: Feb 9, 2026 = $2.902/gal, Jan 2026 = $2.809/gal

**Seasonal pattern analysis**:
- Jan→Apr changes historically: 2015: +$0.35, 2016: +$0.16, 2017: +$0.07, 2018: +$0.20, 2019: +$0.55, 2020: -$0.71 (COVID), 2021: +$0.52, 2022: +$0.79, 2023: +$0.26, 2024: +$0.54, 2025: +$0.10
- Excluding 2020 COVID anomaly, median increase: ~$0.26/gal
- Recent years (2023-2025) show smaller increases: $0.26, $0.54, $0.10

**EIA forecast context**: Annual 2026 average of $2.91/gal suggests April should be near or slightly above this (spring typically above annual average).

## (d) Justification

Starting from current Feb 2026 price of ~$2.90/gal, I expect April 2026 to be modestly higher due to:

1. **Seasonal factors**: Spring driving season and summer blend switchover typically add $0.10-$0.30/gal from Feb to April
2. **EIA forecast anchor**: $2.91/gal annual average suggests April in $2.85-$3.15 range
3. **Recent trend**: Prices have stabilized in low $2.80s-$2.90s after declining from 2025 levels
4. **Crude oil outlook**: EIA expects oversupply to keep prices moderate, limiting upside
5. **Historical volatility**: April prices have ranged $1.84-$4.11 over past 12 years, but recent stability suggests tighter range

Central estimate: ~$3.05/gal (current $2.90 + typical seasonal increase of $0.15)

Outside View Calibration:

The distribution should reflect:
- Strong central tendency around $2.90-$3.10 based on current prices and seasonal patterns
- Moderate upside risk (geopolitical events, refinery issues, demand surge): tail to ~$3.50
- Moderate downside risk (recession, oversupply shock): tail to ~$2.50
- Historical April standard deviation of ~$0.65 suggests 80% interval of roughly ±$0.50 from median
- Recent years show less volatility than 2020-2022 period, justifying somewhat tighter distribution
- Unknown unknowns (major geopolitical events, supply disruptions) warrant 10th-90th percentile span of ~$0.80
