Analysis:
**1) Target variable / resolution (paraphrase)**  
Forecast the **EIA “U.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices” monthly average** for **April 2026**, in **USD per gallon**.

## (a) Source analysis (quality, date, and what is fact vs opinion)

1) **EIA Weekly retail price datapoint (via Patch/AAA/EIA references; Feb 9-10, 2026 reporting)**  
- **What it says (fact):** National average regular gasoline is about **$2.90/gal** in early Feb 2026 (multiple local-news summaries citing AAA/EIA; consistent with the cited number $2.902).  
- **Quality/date:** Near-real-time and highly relevant, but note these are **weekly** snapshots (not the monthly April value). Still excellent as a starting level.

2) **EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), Feb 10, 2026**  
- **What it says (fact + forecast):**  
  - Forecast **2026 annual average retail gasoline: $2.91/gal** (forecast/opinion by EIA with model-based methodology).  
  - Forecast **Brent 2026 average: $58/bbl**, with rationale that **global supply exceeds demand** and inventories rise (forecast).  
- **Quality/date:** Very high credibility and directly tied to energy fundamentals; however it is **annual average**, not April specifically.

3) **GasBuddy 2026 forecast (Rigzone Jan 14, 2026; also echoed in CBS Jan 6, 2026)**  
- **What it says (forecast/opinion by identifiable expert org):**  
  - **2026 average ~$2.97/gal**.  
  - Seasonal pattern: **spring peak** into low **$3.20s**, with **May ~$3.12** and **December ~$2.83** (Rigzone summary).  
- **Quality/date:** Good, market-facing forecaster with granular station data. Still **an opinion/forecast**, and month-specific numbers are not the resolving EIA series—but directionally very useful for seasonal shape.

4) **AskNews local/regional pieces (Patch, North Jersey, KVAL, etc.; Feb 3–10, 2026)**  
- **What they say (mix of fact + expert quotes):**  
  - Facts: current prices around high-$2s nationally; some regional spikes (West Coast) due to **summer-grade transition** and refinery maintenance.  
  - Opinions: Patrick De Haan (GasBuddy) suggests national average could move **above $3** for part of spring; mentions potential April refinery shutdowns in California affecting West Coast.  
- **Quality/date:** Timely; mostly secondary reporting. Useful for **near-term direction** and risks, less for precise April national monthly mean.

5) **Natural gas articles (Naturalgasintel, CP24; Feb 10 and late Jan 2026)**  
- **Relevance:** Mostly **indirect**. Weather-driven natural gas volatility can correlate with energy complex sentiment, but it’s not a strong direct driver of **retail gasoline** by April.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

**Strong evidence**
- **Seasonality:** Gasoline typically rises from winter into spring due to refinery maintenance and the switch to summer blends (structural, recurring). This is a robust pattern and directly relevant to April.
- **Current price level as anchor:** Early Feb 2026 national average around **$2.90/gal** is a concrete starting point.

**Moderate evidence**
- **EIA STEO 2026 annual average $2.91/gal** and crude oil downshift narrative (oversupply): credible and constrains the upside for sustained high prices, but April can sit above the annual mean.
- **GasBuddy month profile (May highest ~$3.12):** provides a plausible seasonal curve; April likely a bit below May, all else equal.

**Weak evidence**
- **Natural gas storage/weather stories:** may affect energy sentiment and some operating costs, but weak linkage to April national retail gasoline.
- **Regional refinery events (e.g., California maintenance):** real but the national monthly average impact is typically diluted unless disruptions are unusually large.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- Today: **2026-02-11**. April 2026 monthly average is ~**7–11 weeks** away (depending on whether you think of early/late April purchasing, but the outcome is the full-month average).
- If the timeframe were **halved** (forecasting March instead of April), I’d pull the distribution **down** a bit (less time for seasonal ramp; more like high-$2.90s).
- If the timeframe were **doubled** (forecasting into early summer), I’d push the distribution **up** modestly (greater chance of hitting the spring/early-summer seasonal high).

## (d) Justification: updating from outside view to inside view
**Outside-view base rate distribution (given):**  
P10 2.65, P20 2.80, P40 2.95, P60 3.10, P80 3.25, P90 3.45.

**Key inside-view adjustments**
1) **Anchor to observed Feb level (~$2.90)** plus typical spring ramp: With ~2 months to April, a **+$0.05 to +$0.20** move from early Feb to April is plausible, putting the center near **$3.00–$3.10**. This supports keeping the median near ~$3.03–$3.08.
2) **Constrain the upside a bit using EIA’s oversupply/oil-downshift outlook:** EIA’s **$2.91 annual average** and expected crude decline argues against a large national spike absent a shock. This slightly reduces probability mass above, say, **$3.50+** versus more volatile years.
3) **But keep tails wide:** Geopolitics (Iran/Middle East), surprise refinery outages, or a sharper-than-expected seasonal squeeze could still produce an April print well above $3.50. Conversely, macro slowdown + crude sliding faster could push April closer to the mid/high $2.60s.

Net: I **nudge the lower tail down slightly** (because the overall 2026 regime looks cheaper than the full 2014–2025 April reference class) and **leave/edge up the upper tail a bit** for shock risk, while keeping the center close to the outside view.

Distribution calibration:
- **Status quo / trend-continuation scenario:** Feb around $2.90, drifting upward into April to roughly **$3.03–$3.10**.
- **My inside-view center:** April 2026 most likely around **$3.05/gal** (slightly above annual mean, slightly below May peak idea).
- I’m widening the 10–90 range modestly to reflect “unknown unknowns,” but keeping it consistent with a relatively low-price 2026 baseline.

Checklist:
1) **Resolution check:** Monthly **EIA U.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices** for **April 2026**, **USD/gal** — aligned.  
2) **Outside view base rate:** (2.65, 2.80, 2.95, 3.10, 3.25, 3.45) — used as baseline.  
3) **Consistency:** Implied median ≈ (P40+P60)/2 = **3.03**; mean ≈ **~3.07**; consistent with Feb ~$2.90 plus seasonal lift and EIA/GasBuddy context.  
4) **Top evidence (<=20 words each):**
   - Early Feb 2026 national average ~**$2.90/gal** (current level anchor).
   - Seasonal spring/summer blend transition typically lifts prices into April/May.
   - EIA STEO: **2026 avg $2.91**; expects crude down via global oversupply.
   - GasBuddy: spring peak low $3.20s; **May ~$3.12** implies April slightly lower.  
5) **Blind spot:** A major geopolitical supply shock or widespread refinery outages could push April **much higher** than forecast.  
6) **Status quo outcome:** Continued moderate crude + normal seasonality → April near low **$3s**.  
7) **Technicalities:** Percentiles strictly increasing; units USD/gal; tails reasonably wide.
