Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. EIA weekly retail gasoline price update (9 Feb 2026, $2.902/gal). Primary data; authoritative; factual.  
2. EIA February-26 Short-Term Energy Outlook (released 10 Feb 2026). Forecast annual 2026 regular gasoline $2.91/gal; Brent $58. Authoritative; model-based outlook.  
3. GasBuddy 2026 outlook (14 Jan 2026, Patrick De Haan). Forecast spring peak $3.20-3.25, May high $3.12. Reliable private forecaster; methodology public; partly opinion.  
4. CBS News / MoneyWatch piece (6 Jan 2026) summarising GasBuddy numbers; journalistic secondary source.  
5. Patch / AAA state stories (9-10 Feb 2026) – current averages CT $2.89, US $2.90; factual spot data.  
6. KESQ / GasBuddy story (3 Feb 2026) – describes refinery shutdowns, transition to summer blends; factual + expert commentary.  
7. Naturalgasintel, CP24 pieces – natural-gas market, largely irrelevant; ignored.  
All of the above are recent (Jan-Feb 2026) and come from known organisations; factual numbers separated from forward-looking opinion quotes.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Present national average is $2.90/gal (EIA weekly 9 Feb 26) – direct measurement.  
• April has historically run ~20-45 ¢ above February in non-shock years (EIA monthly history 2014-25).  

Moderate evidence  
• EIA STEO annual 2026 average forecast $2.91 → implies only small seasonal lift in Q2.  
• GasBuddy spring-peak forecast $3.20-3.25, echoed by CBS, KESQ – independent private forecaster.  
• Seasonal switch to summer-grade gasoline & refinery maintenance begins in March, tends to tighten supply.  

Weak evidence  
• Natural-gas outlook (indirect).  
• Speculation about major geopolitical shocks beyond current baseline.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome window opens in seven weeks and spans all of April (≈ 50 days). If the horizon were halved (price known in late March), the seasonal uplift would be smaller → distribution would shift ~-10-15 ¢. If doubled (through August), larger summer volatility & hurricane risk would widen tails by ~10 ¢ each side.

(d) Justification / adjustments from outside view  
Outside-view median (April 2014-25) = $2.83 with 10-90 range $2.10-4.35.  
Adjust upward because:  
• Current level already $2.90 and rising week-on-week (moderate evidence).  
• Typical Feb→Apr uplift ≈ +0.30 $/gal (strong historical evidence).  
Counter-adjust downward because:  
• Brent expected to ease through spring (moderate evidence, EIA STEO).  
• Surplus global crude capacity & record U.S. output (moderate).  
Net: push central 40-60 band to $3.00-3.20 (slightly below outside view centre of $3.25) while keeping fat tails for shocks (refinery fire, Mideast escalation, or oil collapse).

Distribution calibration
10th percentile chosen where Feb price falls on unexpected crude drop (WTI <$50) and seasonal uplift muted.  
90th percentile reflects scenario of crude >$90 or major Gulf Coast refinery outage during RVP switch.

Checklist:
1. Target: EIA monthly average retail price, regular gasoline, April 2026, USD/gal.  
2. Outside-view base: median 2.95, 10-90 range 2.10-4.35.  
3. Consistency: implied median 3.10; mean ≈ 3.17; consistent with evidence.  
4. Key facts: (i) current avg $2.90; (ii) Feb→Apr uplift ≈ $0.30; (iii) EIA 2026 annual $2.91; (iv) GasBuddy spring peak $3.20.  
5. Blind-spot: Strait of Hormuz closure in March → crude spikes above $100 → April >$4.50 (upside).  
6. Status-quo: if nothing changed, April ≈ $2.90; slight nudge toward this preserved in distribution.  
7. Technicalities: increasing percentiles, correct units, within open bounds.
