Analysis:
(a) Source analysis
1. EIA annual-average gasoline prices (release 10-Feb-2026).  Primary data from the agency that will ultimately resolve the question; purely factual, high quality, but annual rather than monthly.
2. EIA Gasoline & Diesel Fuel Update (weekly data to 9-Feb-2026).  The most up-to-date nationwide price ( $2.902 / gal ).  Factual, high quality; weekly values are noisier than monthly but indicate the near-term trend.
3. AFDC navigation page.  Contains no data—ignored.
4. FRED methodology note for the weekly gasoline series.  Explains collection method, no numbers—ignored for price level.
5. MoneyWeek article on UK household energy bills (May 2023).  Not relevant to U.S. retail gasoline—ignored.
6. Rigzone article (14-May-2025) summarising the May-2025 EIA STEO.  Gives an older EIA projection of $3.16 / gal for 2026 Q2.  Useful as a dated expert forecast but superseded by newer STEO.
7. EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (10-Feb-2026).  Latest official forecast: 2026 annual average $2.91 / gal, Brent crude $58 / bbl.  High quality, most relevant expert opinion.
8. Agent report: full monthly history Jan-2014 – Jan-2026 from the same EIA series that will resolve the question.  Factual, indispensable baseline.

(b) Reference class analysis
Candidate reference classes:
• April average price in the last 12 years (2014-2025) – closest calendar match, captures typical spring seasonality after the switch to summer blends and refinery maintenance.
• All monthly prices 2014-2025 – larger sample but mixes seasons and dulls the regular Jan-to-Apr upswing.
• April prices 1994-2025 (32 obs.) – longer history, but structural breaks (tax changes, inflation, EV share) make 1990s data less comparable in real terms.

I choose the first class – April 2014-2025 – as the best compromise between relevance and sample size.

(c) Timeframe analysis
• Today → first day of April 2026: ≈ 50 days; → full-month average known: ≈ 80 days.
• In the reference class the mean Jan → Apr change is +$0.35/gal (std ≈ $0.20) excluding the COVID shock in 2020.
• Jan-2026 monthly price is $2.809; the 9-Feb-2026 weekly figure is $2.902, suggesting roughly one-third of the typical seasonal rise has already occurred.

(d) Justification
Baseline level: $2.809 (Jan) + $0.35 (seasonal median) ≈ $3.16.
Adjustment for macro backdrop:
• Latest STEO points to a softer crude market than the 2022-24 period (Brent forecast $58/bbl vs $67 in Jan-2026).  That argues for a modest downward tilt relative to the historical mean seasonal lift.
• Current inventory builds and continued high U.S. crude production make a sharp spike (>$4) improbable absent a supply shock.
• Conversely, outright price collapses (<$2.3) have required dramatic demand contractions (e.g., Apr-2020 COVID), which are not evident.

Hence a symmetric but slightly lower-than-historical centre of gravity around $3.05–$3.20, with fat but not extreme tails for geopolitical shocks or recession.

Outside view calibration:
Historical April distribution (2014-2025): min $1.84, 25th $2.44, median $2.78, 75th $3.60, max $4.11.  
Unexpected outcomes (Ukraine war, COVID) pushed the value outside the 75th/25th range twice in 12 years ⇒ ≈ 17 % tail frequency.  I therefore allow generous tails beyond the inter-quartile range.

I anchor the 50th percentile at $3.05, then widen to ±0.6 $ at the 10th/90th to cover low-probability supply shocks or a sudden demand slump, ensuring strictly increasing percentiles.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 2.40  
Percentile 20: 2.65  
Percentile 40: 2.90  
Percentile 60: 3.15  
Percentile 80: 3.45  
Percentile 90: 3.80
