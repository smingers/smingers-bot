Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. EIA weekly Gasoline & Diesel Fuel Update (9 Feb 2026): official government data, national average $2.90 / gal. High-quality, factual, very recent.  
2. EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (10 Feb 2026): official forecast; annual 2026 gasoline average $2.91, Brent $58. High-quality, but monthly granularity lacking.  
3. GasBuddy 2026 Fuel Price Outlook (14 Jan 2026): independent analyst with good track record; projects spring peak low-$3.20s, May highest at $3.12; April implied ≈$3.05-$3.15. Moderate quality.  
4. AAA/Patch & Stacker local-price articles (9-10 Feb 2026): aggregated AAA data echo national $2.89-$2.90. Factual but add little beyond EIA update.  
5. MoneyDJ, KESQ, KVAL stories (3-9 Feb 2026): note winter-storm-related uptick and West-Coast refinery maintenance. Corroborate seasonal upward pressure.  
6. Naturalgasintel, CP24 pieces: natural-gas-focused; relevance only through general energy context → weak weight.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• EIA weekly national average $2.90 (direct measurement).  
• Historical Feb→Apr seasonal lift of ≈$0.25-$0.35/gal (30-year data, persistent pattern).  
Moderate evidence  
• GasBuddy forecast spring peak ≈$3.20; implies April near $3.10.  
• EIA STEO annual 2026 forecast $2.91, signalling no structural price spike.  
• Reports of refinery maintenance / summer-blend transition on West Coast pushing prices up regionally.  
Weak evidence  
• Indirect natural-gas stories, anecdotal Connecticut/Oregon price moves, geopolitical speculation.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome known in 80 days.  Two months is long enough for crude swings or refinery outages but short for structural shifts.  If the window were halved (40 days), uncertainty—mainly crude volatility—would drop ~20 %; if doubled (160 days), I would widen tails by ~15 cents.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
Base-rate distribution (μ = $3.10, σ = $0.30) already centres near likely April figure.  Latest data ($2.90) sits slightly below that mean; adding typical +$0.28 seasonal bump gives $3.18.  Counter-weights:  
• Brent forward curve is backward-dated; EIA expects inventories to rise → softens crude by spring.  
• Annual STEO average $2.91 suggests April shouldn’t stray far above $3.20.  
• No current large supply disruption; OPEC+ cuts only through March.  
Net effect: shift median down 5 cents to $3.05, keep spread similar, fatten right tail a bit for refinery/outage risk (+California maintenance), and left tail for demand shock or crude slide.

Distribution calibration
10th percentile: $2.55  – Requires crude <$50 or demand shock; unlikely but within historic two-month drops.  
20th percentile: $2.75  – Mild crude softness, minimal seasonal lift.  
40th percentile: $2.95  – Continuation of current $2.90 with half-strength seasonality.  
60th percentile (median ≈$3.05): Typical seasonality, crude ~mid-$60s.  
80th percentile: $3.35  – Strong spring run-up, Brent >$75, refinery hiccups.  
90th percentile: $3.65  – Significant outage or geopolitical spike but shy of 2022 record.

Checklist:
1. Target: EIA monthly average U.S. regular gasoline price for April 2026, USD/gal.  
2. Outside-view distribution referenced and adjusted, not abandoned.  
3. Implied mean ≈$3.10; median $3.05 – consistent with rationale.  
4. Key evidence: a) current $2.90; b) +$0.28 typical Feb→Apr lift; c) STEO annual $2.91; d) GasBuddy spring peak $3.20; e) West-Coast refinery maintenance.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden Middle-East escalation pushing Brent >$90 → outcome >$3.80 (upside).  
6. Status quo ($2.90) nudged upward modestly, matching historical pattern.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units in USD/gal; within open bounds 1.5–7.5.
