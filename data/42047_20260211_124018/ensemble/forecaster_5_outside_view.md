Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. EIA “LeafHandler” monthly series (release 10 Feb 2026). Hard data, no opinion. Covers Jan-2014 – Jan-2026; this is the same series the question will use for resolution, so it is the highest-quality factual source.  
2. EIA Gasoline & Diesel Fuel Update, 9 Feb 2026. Weekly retail prices by PADD. Official EIA data; timely, reliable.  
3. EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) dated 10 Feb 2026. Official forecast; good expert opinion, but gives only annual averages in the public summary.  
4. Rigzone article, 14 May 2025, summarising the May-2025 STEO. Journalistic secondary source; still EIA-based, but six-to-nine months old. Useful as an historical benchmark, lower weight today.  
5. Methodology pages or non-U.S./non-gasoline articles (AFDC index, FRED methodology, MoneyWeek). Contain no numbers that help forecast April-2026 gasoline prices; ignored for quantitative work.  
Overall, the forecast should rely primarily on EIA historical monthly series for the outside view, with the most recent weekly data used only to gauge where we are inside the historical distribution.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• All April monthly averages 1994-2025 (32 years).  
• All April monthly averages 2014-2025 (12 recent years, post-shale, pre-COVID & post-COVID).  
• All Q2 monthly averages (Apr+May+Jun) 2014-2025.  
Because U.S. gasoline pricing structure changed markedly after the shale boom (2010s) and again after COVID, the 2014-2025 April-only set best balances sample size with structural relevance. That class has a mean of $2.95 / gal and a standard deviation of ≈ $0.56; min $1.84 (2020) and max $4.11 (2022).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today is 11 Feb 2026; the April-2026 average will cover 1 Apr–30 Apr and be published in mid-May—roughly 80 days out.  In the monthly series, a two-month window typically sees changes of ±$0.10–$0.60, skewed upward heading into spring because of refinery maintenance and the switchover to summer gasoline.  Excluding the pandemic collapse of 2020, Feb→Apr has averaged a +$0.30 lift in the past decade.

(d) Justification for outside-view centre  
• Most recent weekly national price (2 .902 $/gal) is slightly below the 2014-2025 April mean.  
• Adding the historical +$0.30 seasonal uplift gives ≈ $3.20.  
• The February-2026 STEO expects the full-year 2026 average at $2.91—a bit below 2025’s $3.10—implying that EIA is not forecasting an extraordinary spring spike. Taken together, a modal value a little above $3.00 appears reasonable.  
• Geopolitical risk (e.g., Middle-East supply shock) remains a live tail but is already partially priced into crude at $67/bbl in January and falling futures curves. That warrants a moderately long right tail but not the extreme 2022 experience as the central case.

Outside view calibration:

Starting distribution: normal with μ = $3.10, σ = $0.30, then fatten tails for low-probability shocks (pandemic-like collapse or war-driven spike).  Historical “surprise” events (2008, 2020, 2022) suggest ≈ 10 % probability of being ≥ $0.50 above or below the normal-based 90 % band.  I therefore widen the 10th/90th percentiles by an extra $0.15 each.

Checks:  
• 10th at $2.60 still above the series all-time minimum ($1.03) but captures a large demand or crude-price drop.  
• 90th at $3.60 is well below the 2022 wartime peak ($4.11) but reflects the lower crude forecasts and ample U.S. production in 2026.  
• Percentiles are strictly increasing.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 2.60  
Percentile 20: 2.80  
Percentile 40: 3.00  
Percentile 60: 3.15  
Percentile 80: 3.35  
Percentile 90: 3.60
