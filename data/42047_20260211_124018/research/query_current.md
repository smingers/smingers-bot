Analysis:
To pin down an April-2026 national gasoline average, I need the newest hard data and expert outlooks that matter over the next two months: (1) EIA’s February 2026 Short-Term Energy Outlook, which usually contains a monthly retail gasoline forecast; (2) current RBOB futures and analyst commentary on how crude prices, refinery turnarounds, summer-blend regulations, and geopolitical risks (OPEC+, Russia, Middle East) could push prices up or down; (3) nationwide pump-price tracking from AAA or GasBuddy and their spring projections. News pieces or reports published in the past few days will illuminate how markets interpret oil supply-demand balances heading into the driving season and therefore where April’s average might settle.
