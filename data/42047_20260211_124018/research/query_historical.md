Analysis:
The key to forming a reasonable prior for April 2026 gasoline prices is (1) understanding the long-run historical distribution of EIA monthly “U.S. Regular All Formulations Retail Gasoline Prices,” (2) seeing where the latest actual data (through Jan 2026) sits in that distribution, and (3) reviewing near-term outlooks from EIA’s February 2026 Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) and other forecasters.  Therefore, I want:
• A long time-series table or chart of EIA monthly prices (to compute means, medians, and variance).  
• Recent news or analysis discussing expectations for spring-summer 2026 gasoline prices, crude supply, refining margins, and policy changes.  
• The February 2026 STEO, which typically gives a monthly forecast, plus any other analyst projections for April 2026.  
• Supplementary FRED data (the monthly GASREGC1 series is essentially the same EIA series) to allow quick summary statistics.
