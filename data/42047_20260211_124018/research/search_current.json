This remains notably lower than the $3.09 per gallon recorded a year earlier, indicating a year-over-year decline for drivers statewide. Nationally, regular gasoline prices have also seen modest increases, with the U.S. average rising into the high-$2 range, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) data. The national average is slightly higher than a week prior but still below year-ago levels, reflecting a trend consistent with Connecticut's pricing pattern.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 03:55 PM\nSource:[Patch](https://patch.com/connecticut/newmilford/connecticut-gas-prices-tick-slightly-while-new-milford-drivers-find-local)\n\n**Wilton Gas Prices Slightly Above State Average as Connecticut Costs Remain Lower Than Year Ago**\nGas prices in Connecticut have slightly increased over the past week, with the statewide average reaching approximately $2.90 per gallon as of February 10, 2026, up from $2.89 the previous week and nearly unchanged from a month prior. Wilton motorists are paying slightly above the state average but still below the $3.09 per gallon seen at the same time last year, indicating year-over-year relief for drivers. According to the EIA, the national average for regular gasoline is near the high-$2 range\u2014slightly lower than Connecticut\u2019s current average but also down from the same period last year.

In the same period, ethanol prices reached R$ 3.59 per liter in the city, R$ 3.69 per liter statewide, and R$ 2.86 per liter in S\u00e3o Paulo city, R$ 2.820 in the state, and R$ 2.970 nationally. The highest gasoline prices were recorded at a station in Jardim Europa, where a R$ 0.20 increase occurred before Easter. The station manager could not confirm whether another price adjustment would be made. The station\u2019s strategy to attract customers includes offering free showers to those who refuel above ten liters. According to Jos\u00e9 Alberto Paiva Gouveia, president of the S\u00e3o Paulo State Retail Petroleum Derivatives Trade Union, gasoline price increases are determined by Petrobras based on international oil prices and the dollar exchange rate, with the cost flowing through the supply chain to retailers, who decide whether to pass the increase to consumers. Regarding ethanol, the price increase was described as atypical by the unionist, as prices usually fall during harvest season, but producers raised them instead. Ivelise Rasera Bragato Calcidoni, researcher at Cepea (Center for Advanced Studies in Applied Economics) at USP, explained that rainfall hindered sugarcane harvesting and milling, reducing supply. She added that distribution companies were active during the Easter holiday period due to high demand, and the combination of reduced supply and elevated demand contributed to the price rise. The increase in fuel prices was the main driver of the April pre-inflation index, according to IBGE (Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics). The IPCA-15 (National Consumer Price Index-15) for April reached 0.72%, up from 0.54% in March and the highest April reading since 2015, when it was 1.07%. Transport prices rose 1.31%, mainly due to fuel prices, which increased by 3% on average, with gasoline up 3.22% and ethanol up 2.74%. Diesel rose 1.06%. In March, transport prices had risen 0.59%. The second-largest impact came from food and beverages, which rose 0.92%, down from 1.28% in March.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 01:45 PM\nSource:[Agora S\u00e3o Paulo](https://agora.folha.uol.com.br/grana/2019/04/litro-da-gasolina-passa-de-r-5-na-capital.shtml)\n\n**Monroe Gas Prices Little Changed This Week, Below Year-Ago Levels With Mixed Station Costs**\nAccording to AAA's weekly fuel price survey, the average regular-grade gasoline price in Connecticut is $2.89 per gallon, a marginal increase from $2.88 the previous week and consistent with the level seen one month earlier. This is significantly lower than the $3.09 per gallon average observed in the same period a year ago, indicating that drivers are paying less today than they did in February 2025. Nationally, the average price for a gallon of regular gasoline is $2.90, showing a similar pattern of slight weekly and monthly increases but a clear year-over-year decline. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) confirms that retail gasoline prices have risen modestly in recent weeks across the U.S. and Connecticut but remain below levels from the prior year, reflecting broader market trends influenced by crude oil costs, seasonal demand, and distribution dynamics.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 07:43 PM\nSource:[Patch](https://patch.com/connecticut/monroe/monroe-gas-prices-little-changed-week-below-year-ago-levels-mixed-station-costs)\n\n**How gas prices have changed in the U.S. in the last week Feb. 9, 2026**\nAccording to data compiled by CheapInsurance.com using AAA statistics, U.S. gas prices as of February 9, 2026, averaged $2.90 per gallon, an increase of $0.03 (+0.9%) over the past week and a decrease of $0.23 (-7.5%) compared to the same time last year. The historical peak for gasoline was $5.02 on June 14, 2022.

This marks a 30.4-cent increase compared to a month ago and a 17.7-cent decrease from a year ago. The national average gasoline price rose 1.2 cents to $2.84 per gallon, up 5.4 cents from one month prior and 24.9 cents lower than the same period last year. Diesel prices rose 2.9 cents to $3.614 per gallon nationally. In Eugene, the price range spanned from $2.69/g (lowest) to $3.69/g (highest), a difference of 100.0 cents per gallon; statewide, prices ranged from $2.69/g to $4.19/g, a $1.50 difference. Historical data shows Eugene\u2019s average price was $3.31/g on February 9, 2024, and $3.53/g on February 9, 2025. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, attributed the recent rise to seasonal shifts, particularly California\u2019s transition to summer-grade gasoline, with West Coast states leading the increases. He noted that despite a slight drop in oil prices due to reduced geopolitical risk, seasonal pressures are expected to spread eastward, potentially pushing the national average above $3.00 per gallon for part of the spring.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 06:31 PM\nSource:[KVAL](https://kval.com/news/local/eugene-gas-prices-jump-169-cents-in-a-week-now-averaging-335-a-gallon)\n\n**NJ gas prices are creeping up again. How high will they go?**\nNew Jersey gas prices are expected to rise gradually, with forecasts predicting prices could reach just over $3.00 per gallon by late spring, according to GasBuddy.com data from early January. On February 9, 2026, prices ranged from $2.73 at a Wawa in Hackensack to $2.74 at a QuickChek on Route 17. AAA defines any price above $3.00 as a 'pain point,' and a poll estimates a 10 to 30 cent increase by late spring. Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy.com, attributes the rise to increasing spring demand and the upcoming switch to more expensive summer-blend gasoline, which typically occurs in April in the Northeast. He predicts prices may dip below $3.00 by July 4. Despite short-term increases, prices are expected to remain lower than in previous years due to slow demand, steady production, and ample inventories. Mark Schieldrop of AAA Northeast noted that cold weather has suppressed driving, contributing to lower demand. The Energy Information Administration (EIA) projects global oil production will exceed demand through 2027, with Brent crude expected to fall from $68 to $56 in 2026 and $54 in 2027. OPEC+ has paused production through March 2026, which could push prices up if extended. U.S. military involvement in Venezuela may eventually lower oil prices due to increased output, but De Haan cautions this effect won't be felt before 2026 due to infrastructure gaps. Meanwhile, concerns over Middle East instability and U.S.-Iran talks continue to influence global oil markets. The EIA forecasts daily oil production will rise by 1.4 million barrels in 2026 and an additional 500,000 in 2027.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 05:22 PM\nSource:[North Jersey](https://eu.northjersey.com/story/news/business/2026/02/09/nj-gas-prices-how-high-will-they-go-aaa-gas-prices/88589231007/)\n\n**Winter Storm Disrupts Supply, Driving U.S. Retail Gas Prices Up \u2013 MoneyDJ Financial News**\nA winter storm sweeping across much of the United States caused supply disruptions, pushing the national average price of regular unleaded gasoline to $2.87 per gallon, up 2.4 cents from the previous week, $0.49 higher than one month prior, and $0.246 lower than the same period last year. U.S. gasoline demand reached 8.757 million barrels per day in the week ending January 23, marking the highest level in five weeks. The top 10 highest-priced markets include Hawaii ($4.41), California ($4.26), Washington State ($3.88), Alaska ($3.44), Nevada ($3.40), Oregon ($3.40), Washington D.C. ($3.10), Pennsylvania ($3.01), Maryland ($2.99), and Vermont ($2.98). The lowest 10 markets are Oklahoma ($2.40), Arkansas ($2.43), Mississippi ($2.44), Louisiana ($2.46), Kansas ($2.47), Missouri ($2.49), Texas ($2.49), Tennessee ($2.52), Alabama ($2.52), and North Dakota ($2.52). According to GasBuddy, the national average dropped 0.9 cents to $2.83 per gallon on February 2, up 3.9 cents from one month ago, and down 21.3 cents from the same time last year. GasBuddy's data covers over 150,000 gas stations and is compiled from more than 11 million weekly price reports. Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy's petroleum analyst, stated that oil prices have surged to multi-month highs amid geopolitical tensions, a weakening dollar, and supply concerns, yet the national average has remained relatively stable. He noted that rising prices in the western U.S. are driven by the upcoming summer fuel transition and expected refinery shutdowns in California in April, with more states likely to see price increases in the coming weeks. GasBuddy's 2026 Fuel Price Outlook predicts the national average gasoline price will fall below $3.00 per gallon for the first time since the pandemic, reaching $2.97 per gallon\u201413 cents lower than the 2025 average of $3.10. This reflects a long-term trend due to slowing oil demand growth, driven by rising electric vehicle adoption and improved energy efficiency. Despite supply disruptions, oil prices are constrained by structural demand shifts. The U.S. domestic oil production increase, highlighted by the Connecticut Energy Marketers Association, is a key factor in keeping prices low. This domestic supply acts as a buffer against global shocks. The IEA forecasts global oil supply will exceed demand by at least 3.8 million barrels per day in 2026, potentially the largest surplus in history. The EIA predicts Brent crude could fall to $55 per barrel in Q1 2026 and remain low, with a projected surplus of 2.2 million barrels per day for the year.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 11:02 PM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=d7840520-0a51-47e7-bf54-266636316518)\n\n**Average Riverside County Gas Price Records Largest Increase Since Nov. 5**\nThe average price of a gallon of self-serve regular gasoline in Riverside County, California, increased by 3.6 cents to $4.262 on February 3, 2026, marking its largest rise since November 5, 2023.

The price is now 12 cents higher than one week ago and 11.3 cents higher than one month ago, though it remains 12.9 cents lower than one year ago. Since peaking at $6.373 on October 5, 2022, the price has dropped $2.111. Nationally, the average gasoline price rose 0.8 cents to $2.883, remaining 0.5 cents below last week\u2019s level, 6.3 cents above last month, and 21.5 cents below the same time last year. The national average has fallen $2.133 since reaching $5.016 on June 14, 2022. According to Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, oil prices rose due to geopolitical tensions, a weakening U.S. dollar, and supply concerns, yet the national average saw minimal change. Over half of U.S. states experienced declining prices, particularly Indiana and Ohio, while prices are rising across much of the West Coast as the transition to summer gasoline begins, with another refinery shutdown in California expected in April.

The national average for regular gasoline fell to approximately $2.85 per gallon on Monday, remaining below $3.00 since December 2, and rose slightly to about $2.86 on Tuesday. Consumers heading to the roads before the Christmas holidays are expected to see moderate prices. Prices vary significantly by state: Hawaii had the highest average at about $4.44 per gallon, followed by California at $4.30 and Washington at $3.92. In contrast, Oklahoma had the lowest average at approximately $2.30 per gallon, with Arkansas and Iowa both near $2.42. Nationally, regular gasoline has dropped more than 18 cents compared to the same period last year and 21 cents from a month prior. AAA states this December marks the cheapest gasoline prices since 2020, when the COVID-19 pandemic disrupted the economy. The decline is attributed to strong supply and relatively moderate crude oil prices, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) staying below $60 per barrel for most of December. The price drop is welcome amid ongoing inflation and elevated costs for groceries and holiday gifts, especially under the continued impact of President Donald Trump\u2019s tariffs on foreign imports. Government data showed consumer prices rose 2.7% year-over-year in November, though inflation remains well above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. Economists cautioned that the November data may be distorted due to delays and the 43-day federal government shutdown.

The decline is attributed to strong fuel supply and relatively stable crude oil prices, with West Texas Intermediate (WTI) staying below $60 per barrel for most of December. State-level variations persist: Hawaii had the highest average at $4.44 per gallon, followed by California at $4.30 and Washington at $3.92. Oklahoma recorded the lowest average at $2.30, with Arkansas and Iowa at nearly $2.42. Despite this relief at the pump, inflation remains a concern, with consumer prices rising 2.7% year-over-year in November\u2014still above the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target. The Conference Board reported a decline in consumer confidence to its lowest level since April 2025, reflecting ongoing public frustration over the high cost of living and economic uncertainty. AAA attributes the lower prices to sustained supply and moderate crude oil costs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 23, 2025 05:54 PM\nSource:[PBS.org](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/u-s-drivers-are-seeing-lower-gas-prices-this-holiday-season-according-to-aaa)\n\n**US drivers are seeing lower gas prices this holiday season**\nThis holiday season, U.S. drivers are experiencing lower gas prices, with the national average for unleaded gasoline falling to about $2.85 per gallon on December 2, 2025, and remaining below $3.00 since then. As of December 23, 2025, the average had slightly increased to $2.86 per gallon. According to AAA, this marks the cheapest December for gas prices since 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic. Prices are more than 18 cents lower than at the same time last year and 21 cents lower than a month prior. Regional variations persist: Hawaii had the highest average at $4.44 per gallon, followed by California ($4.30) and Washington ($3.92), while Oklahoma had the lowest at $2.30, with Arkansas and Iowa at nearly $2.42. Strong crude oil supply and West Texas Intermediate prices staying below $60 per barrel for most of December contributed to the decline. This relief comes amid ongoing inflation concerns, with consumer prices rising 2.7% year-over-year in November, though the Federal Reserve\u2019s 2% target remains unmet. Economists cautioned that November\u2019s data may be distorted by the 43-day federal government shutdown. Consumer confidence, as measured by the Conference Board, fell to its lowest level since April 2025, reflecting continued public frustration over the high cost of living and job market uncertainty.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 23, 2025 04:55 PM\nSource:[WSLS](https://www.wsls.com/business/2025/12/23/us-drivers-are-seeing-lower-gas-prices-this-holiday-season/)\n\n**Lundberg survey shows gas prices continuing to fall nationwide**\nAccording to a new Lundberg survey, the national average price for regular gasoline dropped nine cents over the past two weeks to $2.99 per gallon, marking a nearly 17-cent decline over recent months. This is the lowest price since April 2021 and 13 cents cheaper than the same time last year. While the decline provides relief to drivers, analysts note that demand remains weak, and sustained lower prices\u2014lasting at least a month\u2014would be needed to return fuel consumption to normal levels. Wholesale prices continue to fall, allowing retailers room to reduce prices further, with experts predicting the national average could drop another nickel soon. However, oil prices remain volatile due to supply concerns linked to Russia, Venezuela, and a reduction in U.S. drilling rigs, which could cause prices to rise again.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 22, 2025 06:10 PM\nSource:[KYMA](https://kyma.com/dsw-living/consumer/2025/12/22/lundberg-survey-shows-gas-prices-continuing-to-fall-nationwide/)\n\n**Gas prices: Falling costs at the pumps heading into Autumn**\nThe Washington Examiner reports that regular gasoline prices in the United States have remained steady and affordable in 2025.

During the summer, prices fluctuated between $3.13 and $3.20 per gallon, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration noted that this summer\u2019s prices were the lowest for a summer season since 2021. The gap between 2024 and 2025 prices has narrowed, with most states staying below the $3 per gallon threshold.
