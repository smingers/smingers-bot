(source: EIA LeafHandler page for EMM_EPMR_PTE_NUS_DPG \u2013 Release 10-Feb-2026)\n\nStatus of item A \u2013 April 2026 forecast\n\u2022 The February-2026 STEO landing page confirms the report release (10-Feb-2026) and states that the regular-grade gasoline price is forecast to average $2.91 / gal for all of 2026. (source: EIA STEO home page, search result)\n\n\u2022 However, the detailed monthly value for April 2026 is contained only in STEO Table 2 (available in the report PDF and the companion Excel file \u201cfeb26_base.xlsx\u201d). That cell does not appear in any of the snippets returned in the current search results, and therefore the precise April-2026 figure remains unknown.\n\nRemaining information gap\nThe only missing element needed to finish the answer is the single number: \u201cRegular gasoline retail price, April 2026\u201d as forecast in the February-2026 STEO. All other requested data are now in hand.\n\nRecommended next retrieval step\nThe figure can be captured quickly from either of the two public files that accompany every STEO release:\n\n1. Open the PDF version of the Feb-2026 STEO and scroll to Table 2: \u201cU.S. Energy Prices\u201d.  \n2. Alternatively, download the Excel workbook (usually named \u201cfeb26_base.xlsx\u201d), navigate to the tab \u201c2tab\u201d, and read the value at the intersection of row 2026 and column Apr in the series \u201cMotor Gasoline, Regular\u201d.\n\nEither path will yield the definitive EIA forecast required for part A.\n\nIn short, historical prices are complete; only the April-2026 STEO forecast value still needs to be extracted from the source table. Once that number is recorded, the original query will be fully answered.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData query=\"GASREGC1\">\nNo matching FRED series found for \"GASREGC1\".\n</FREDData>\n"
