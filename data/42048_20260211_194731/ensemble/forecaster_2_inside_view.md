Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

**ECDC/ERVISS sources:**
- ECDC COVID-19 testing data page: High quality official source. States the old testing dataset was discontinued Dec 1, 2023, with ERVISS GitHub data as replacement. Factual, no opinions. Highly relevant for understanding data transition.
- ERVISS dashboard article (Jan 16, 2026): High quality official source. Describes the surveillance system but contains no numerical data. Factual description only. Low direct relevance.

**UK surveillance reports (Weeks 2-4, 2026):**
- Three UKHSA reports covering early January 2026: High quality official sources. Show SARS-CoV-2 positivity in England at 1.6-1.8% (hospital settings), described as "baseline levels" and "stable." These are factual measurements from identifiable official sources. Moderate relevance as UK data may proxy for broader European trends, though not EU/EEA specific.

**UK surveillance report (Week 41, 2025):**
- UKHSA report from October 2025: High quality official source. Shows much higher positivity (12.9% hospital, 8.8% community) during autumn 2025. Factual data. Demonstrates that positivity was elevated in autumn but has since declined substantially by January 2026.

**AskNews articles:**
- Multiple measles-focused articles (Feb 11, 2026): High quality sources (ECDC, WHO, UNICEF officials). These discuss measles surveillance and vaccine hesitancy but contain no SARS-CoV-2 test positivity data. Not relevant to the forecasting question.
- Greek EODY report (Dec 11, 2025): Official source. States "SARS-CoV-2 cases remain stable" with 104 hospital admissions and positivity "unchanged." Factual from identifiable source. Moderate relevance for late 2025 EU context.
- Italian RespiVirNet report (Nov 24-30, 2025): Official surveillance source. Reports SARS-CoV-2 positivity at 4.0% among tested samples. Factual data from identifiable source. Moderate relevance for late 2025 EU trends.
- ECDC influenza alerts (Nov 2025): High quality official sources. Focus on early influenza season but note low SARS-CoV-2 activity. Expert opinion from Edoardo Colzani (ECDC) emphasizes influenza urgency, not COVID. Weak relevance for COVID trends.
- Greek EODY report (Sept 22-28, 2025): Official source. Reports increased SARS-CoV-2 positivity with co-circulation of variants (LP.8.1, NB.1.8.1, XFG). Factual. Shows autumn 2025 had some activity but no evidence of increased severity.
- French wastewater surveillance article (Sept 29, 2025): Official sources (Anses, Santé publique France). Discusses expansion of surveillance but provides no current positivity data. Low relevance.

(b) Evidence analysis:

**Strong evidence:**
- UK surveillance data (Jan 2026) consistently shows SARS-CoV-2 positivity at baseline/stable levels (1.6-1.8%), with week-over-week changes minimal. Multiple weekly reports from identifiable official source confirm flat trajectory entering the forecast window.
- Historical outside view analysis identifies 40% base rate for 4-week increases during Feb-Apr window, but notes this occurred only during strong variant waves (Alpha 2021, BA.2 2022).

**Moderate evidence:**
- Greek EODY report (Dec 2025) confirms stable SARS-CoV-2 activity in EU/EEA member state, supporting broader European pattern of low activity.
- Italian surveillance (Nov 2025) shows 4.0% positivity, which while higher than UK January levels, represents moderate rather than high activity.
- Absence of any news/surveillance reports mentioning new immune-escape variants or concerning SARS-CoV-2 trends in EU/EEA for early 2026.

**Weak evidence:**
- Autumn 2025 showed some elevation in activity (UK Oct data at 12.9%), but this has clearly declined by January 2026, suggesting the autumn wave has passed.
- Influenza is the dominant respiratory virus concern in late 2025/early 2026 per ECDC alerts, not SARS-CoV-2.

(c) Timeframe analysis:

The forecast window is approximately 11 weeks (from current week 2026-07 through week 2026-17, ending May 1, 2026). This spans the traditional late-winter/early-spring respiratory virus season.

If timeframe were halved (5-6 weeks): Would decrease probability further, as there would be less time for a new variant to emerge and drive sustained increases. Current flat trajectory would dominate.

If timeframe were doubled (22 weeks, extending into summer): Would increase probability moderately, as longer timeframe increases chance of variant emergence, though summer typically sees lower respiratory virus activity.

(d) Justification:

The outside view established a 40% base rate for 4-week consecutive increases during Feb-Apr windows, calibrated down to 31% given current low activity signals.

**Current factors warranting downward adjustment:**
1. **Flat current trajectory**: UK data shows essentially flat positivity (1.6% → 1.7% → 1.8%) with minimal week-over-week changes. For a 4-week strictly increasing run to occur, we need sustained momentum, not noise-level fluctuations.
2. **No variant signals**: Unlike the 2021-2022 springs that produced 4-week runs (driven by Alpha and BA.2), there are no reports of new immune-escape variants gaining traction in EU/EEA in early 2026.
3. **Post-wave timing**: The autumn 2025 wave has clearly subsided (UK positivity dropped from 12.9% in October to 1.8% in January). Post-wave periods typically show flat or declining trends.
4. **Influenza dominance**: ECDC's focus on early influenza season suggests SARS-CoV-2 is not the primary respiratory concern, consistent with low activity.

**Factors preventing extreme downward adjustment:**
1. **Sufficient time window**: 11 weeks provides adequate opportunity for unexpected variant emergence or seasonal uptick.
2. **Measurement sensitivity**: Strictly increasing criteria can be triggered by relatively small absolute changes if they occur consecutively.
3. **Historical precedent**: Two of five comparable seasons did produce the pattern, showing it's not extremely rare.

The current evidence suggests 2026 resembles the quiet 2023-2025 springs (no 4-week runs) rather than the active 2021-2022 springs. However, the 11-week window and possibility of surprise developments prevent assigning very low probability.

Probability calibration:

Starting from 31% outside view, I adjust downward based on:
- Strong evidence of flat current trajectory (-7 pp)
- Moderate evidence of no variant concerns (-4 pp)
- Moderate evidence from multiple EU sources showing stable/low activity (-3 pp)

This yields approximately 17%. However, I add back:
- Small allowance for measurement noise potentially creating a run (+2 pp)
- Uncertainty about undetected variant emergence (+2 pp)

Final calibrated probability: 21%

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will EU/EEA SARS-CoV-2 test positivity show four consecutive weeks of strict increases in ECDC data before May 1, 2026 (11 weeks)?

2. **Base rate**: Outside view established 31% based on 40% historical seasonal frequency, adjusted for current low activity.

3. **Consistency**: "21 out of 100 times, the ECDC weekly series shows four consecutive strictly increasing weeks before May 1, 2026." This aligns with my assessment that current conditions resemble quiet springs (60% of historical cases) rather than active ones, with slight upward allowance for uncertainty.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - UK surveillance shows flat SARS-CoV-2 positivity at 1.6-1.8% in January 2026 (strong, factual)
   - No new immune-escape variants reported in EU/EEA surveillance (moderate, absence of evidence)
   - Greek/Italian surveillance confirms stable/low EU activity in late 2025 (moderate, factual)
   - Historical runs occurred only during strong variant waves (strong, factual pattern)
   - 11-week window provides time for unexpected developments (moderate, structural)

5. **Blind-spot**: A new immune-escape variant emerges in February 2026 and rapidly spreads across EU/EEA, similar to how BA.2 drove the spring 2022 wave. This could push probability to 50-60%.

6. **Status quo**: Current trajectory is flat/stable at low levels. Maintaining this status quo through May 1 would result in NO resolution. Given low volatility in recent weeks and absence of variant signals, a modest nudge toward status quo (no resolution) is warranted, supporting the 21% figure.

Probability: 21%
