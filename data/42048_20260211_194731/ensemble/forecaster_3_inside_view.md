Analysis:
1) Resolution-criteria paraphrase: From Feb 11, 2026 through Apr 30, 2026, does the EU/EEA series in ECDC’s ERVISS CSV contain any 4-week run where each week’s test-positivity is strictly higher than the prior week?

(a) Source analysis (what we learned; quality/date):
- ECDC “COVID-19 testing data” page (ECDC; undated/maintained page; high reliability): Establishes the older testing dataset ended in 2023 and that the relevant weekly series is now provided via ERVISS/GitHub. This is structural context, not trend evidence.
- ECDC ERVISS dashboard description (ECDC; 16 Jan 2026; high reliability): Confirms ERVISS is the integrated respiratory virus surveillance framework. Provides no EU/EEA SARS‑CoV‑2 positivity trajectory.
- UKHSA National flu & COVID-19 surveillance reports (UK gov; weeks 3–4 2026, published mid/late Jan 2026; high reliability for England): SARS‑CoV‑2 positivity is low and described as “baseline” and largely stable, with only slight week-to-week upticks (e.g., ~1.6%→1.7% or 1.7%→1.8% depending on stream). Useful as a weak proxy for broader NW Europe, but not the EU/EEA aggregate required for resolution.
- AskNews/Euronews & other articles (Feb 2026) focus on measles vaccine hesitancy (reliable outlets, but irrelevant to SARS‑CoV‑2 positivity time series). Minimal forecasting value for this question.
- Other 2025 articles on early influenza season and variant XFG (mixed outlets summarizing ECDC/WHO statements; moderately reliable): Suggest respiratory-virus pressure and some SARS‑CoV‑2 variant monitoring, but do not provide EU/EEA SARS‑CoV‑2 positivity momentum into Feb–Apr 2026.

Bottom line: none of the sources provide direct EU/EEA ERVISS positivity values or a current multi-week upward trend; the only near-term quantitative signal (UK) suggests “stable/baseline,” which slightly disfavors a sustained 4-week monotone increase soon.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to criteria):
Strong evidence:
- None directly bearing on the strict 4-week-increasing run in the EU/EEA ERVISS CSV (no direct series values, no computed streaks).

Moderate evidence:
- UKHSA Jan 2026: low/baseline positivity with small increases but no clear acceleration narrative. This modestly reduces the likelihood that EU/EEA is entering a strong upswing right now (proxy only).
- Seasonal/structural pattern (historical, not in provided sources but consistent with endemic-era behavior): late-winter to spring often trends flat-to-down after winter peaks, though spring waves sometimes occur.

Weak evidence:
- Influenza-early-season reporting and general “respiratory viruses earlier” commentary: could correlate with changes in health-seeking/testing and co-circulation, but direction for SARS‑CoV‑2 positivity is ambiguous.
- Variant “under monitoring” mention (XFG): without evidence of growth in positivity, it’s speculative for this specific streak criterion.

(c) Timeframe analysis:
- Window length: ~79 days (~11 reporting weeks) from Feb 11, 2026 to May 1, 2026.
- If halved (~5–6 weeks): probability would drop materially because you need a near-immediate upward run; fewer opportunities for a 4-increase streak.
- If doubled (~22 weeks): probability would rise substantially because you’d span more of spring/early summer, increasing chances of at least one upward acceleration episode.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from the 42% outside view):
Outside view baseline was 42%, largely from “waves happen; 11 weeks is enough time for an early-wave acceleration that often includes 4 consecutive weekly increases.”

Inside-view updates:
- The best near-term indicator we have (UK, mid-Jan) characterizes SARS‑CoV‑2 as baseline/stable with only slight increases. Given we’re now in mid-Feb, that leans slightly toward “no strong ongoing EU/EEA upswing,” reducing the chance of a clean 4-week strictly-increasing run before May.
- The resolution condition is strict (must be “>” each week). Even if underlying transmission rises, small plateaus/revisions can break the streak—especially in an EU/EEA aggregate series that may be smoothed and influenced by changing testing composition.
- Counterpoint: with ~11 weeks available, a late-Feb/March-to-April rise (whether epidemiologic or reporting-composition-driven) could still generate at least one 4-increase streak. So I’m only making a modest downward adjustment, not a large one.

Probability calibration:
- Status quo (no major new variant-driven wave; endemic/baseline): EU/EEA positivity likely flat-to-down or noisy → streak less likely.
- Upside scenario (spring wave or consistent testing-composition shift): could easily produce one monotone 4-week rise.
- Net: modestly below the 42% base rate.

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: Before May 1, 2026, does EU/EEA ERVISS positivity show any 4 consecutive week-over-week strict increases?
2) Outside view base rate: 42%.
3) Consistency check: 39 out of 100 times, the EU/EEA ERVISS series contains at least one 4-week strictly-increasing run in this window.
4) Key evidence:
   - No direct EU/EEA ERVISS trend data provided; must rely on proxies/seasonality.
   - UKHSA Jan 2026: SARS‑CoV‑2 positivity low and described as stable/baseline.
   - Strict “>” each week makes streak harder than “general increase,” especially with potential plateaus/revisions.
   - 11-week window still gives multiple chances for a spring uptick to create a run.
5) Blind spot: If EU/EEA is already at/near a trough in Feb and a spring wave begins promptly, a clean 4-week rise becomes much more likely (would push probability upward, perhaps to ~55–65%).
6) Status quo outcome: endemic stability implies “No” slightly favored; nudge toward No.

Probability: 39%
