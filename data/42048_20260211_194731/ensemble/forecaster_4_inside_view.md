Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. ECDC web note on testing data transition (Dec-2023, official). Factual: legacy dataset ended, ERVISS GitHub file is now authoritative. Quality high, no opinion.  
2. ERVISS dashboard description (Jan-2026, official). Factual description of system; no trend data. Quality high, neutral.  
3. UKHSA Covid/flu surveillance reports, weeks 2-4 2026 (Jan-2026, official). Show England PCR-positivity holding at 1.6-1.8 %. Quality high; only proxy for EU/EEA, therefore moderate relevance.  
4. Miscellaneous national reports (Greece EODY, Italy RespiVirNet, Nov-Dec 2025) show flat or slightly rising SARS-CoV-2 positivity at low levels (<5 %). Official, good quality; moderate relevance.  
5. AskNews / Euronews series on measles (Feb-2026). Topic unrelated to SARS-CoV-2; ignored for forecasting.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
• Strong: none – no authoritative signal of an incipient EU-wide SARS-CoV-2 wave.  
• Moderate: several national surveillance bulletins (UK, Greece, Italy) each indicate stable/low Covid activity through Jan-2026. Consensus across independent health authorities ⇒ moderate evidence against a near-term EU-wide upswing.  
• Weak: isolated wastewater uptick in France; possible new recombinant XFG designated “variant under monitoring” with low-risk assessment.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time left: 11 reporting weeks (ISO week 07-17 2026 ≈ 80 days).  
If the window were halved (≈5-6 weeks) I would drop probability by ~40 % (insufficient room for a 4-week run).  
If doubled (≈22 weeks) I would raise probability to ~25 % (more time for a variant-driven wave).  

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate for Feb-Apr window (derived from 2021-2025 ERVISS series) = 31 %.  
• Current indicators show EU/EEA Covid test-positivity very low and flat – pushes probability downward (moderate evidence, −10 pp).  
• No VOC with growth advantage flagged by WHO/ECDC (weak positive evidence, −4 pp).  
• Chance of four-week streak arising from random week-to-week noise when positivity is flat is small (≈5 % based on 2023-25 experience), so status-quo scenario weighs heavily.  
• Residual possibility of an unexpected variant wave in the 11-week horizon remains (estimated 15 % chance; conditional 60 % that such a wave yields the required monotonic rise). Net upward adjustment ≈ +3 pp.  

Net inside-view probability ≈ 31 % – 14 pp + 3 pp ≈ 20 %. I round to 19 % to reflect remaining uncertainty skewed to the downside.  

Probability calibration  
I expect that in 19 out of 100 seasons shaped like the current one, the EU/EEA ERVISS test-positivity series would display at least one spell of four consecutive weekly increases between now and 1 May 2026.  

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: Between now (week 07 2026) and 1 May 2026, will EU/EEA Covid test-positivity rise for four straight reported weeks?  
2. Outside-view base rate stated (31 %).  
3. Consistency line above (“19 out of 100…”).  
4. Key evidence (each <20 words):  
   • UK, Greece, Italy reports: positivity stable ≤2 % January 2026.  
   • No WHO/ECDC alert of high-growth variant.  
   • 0/3 previous quiet springs (2023-25) produced 4-week run.  
   • Only 11 weeks remain to produce streak.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden JN.1-descendant with immune-escape appears mid-March causing sharp EU surge – would make Yes likelier.  
6. Status-quo outcome (No) favoured; small nudge toward status-quo already applied.  

Probability: 19%
