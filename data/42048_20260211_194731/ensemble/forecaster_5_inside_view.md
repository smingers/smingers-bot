Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
1. ECDC web-page on COVID-19 testing (Dec 2023) – official, high quality, explains migration of test-positivity reporting to the ERVISS GitHub file. Factual, no current numbers.  
2. ECDC ERVISS dashboard description (Jan 2026) – official, very recent, confirms that weekly EU/EEA SARS-CoV-2 test-positivity series is still being published. Purely descriptive.  
3. Three UKHSA surveillance reports (Jan 2026) – reliable, give week-on-week UK positivity (flat/slightly down), suggesting wider European activity is low. UK is only a proxy.  
4. A set of Euronews/other reports (Nov 2025–Feb 2026) – focus on measles or early influenza season; indirectly show that COVID-19 is no longer headline news, implying no current surge. Mostly background, weak relevance.  
5. Greek, Italian national surveillance notes (Sep–Dec 2025) – official national data; all indicate SARS-CoV-2 positivity either flat or falling as of late 2025. Modest relevance.  
Overall, no source points to a February 2026 uptick in EU/EEA SARS-CoV-2 positivity. All quantitative data available (UK, Greece, Italy) show plateau or decline.

b) Evidence analysis (relative to a four-week monotonic rise before 1 May 2026)  
Strong evidence (against):  
• Historical seasonality 2021-2025 – every year test-positivity fell Feb-Apr; never produced the required 4-week streak. (Structural, multi-year)  
Moderate evidence (against):  
• Current national surveillance (UK week 3 positivity 1.7% vs 1.8% prior; Greece flat; Italy 4.0% → 2.7%) show declining or stable values.  
Moderate evidence (for): none.  
Weak evidence (for): possibility of new variant (XFG is VUM) – no growth signal yet.  
Net: evidence moderately reinforces the “no” side.

c) Time-frame analysis  
Time remaining: 11 reporting weeks (week 6 through week 16 inclusive) until the last dataset published before 1 May. A 4-week ascending run must start by week 13 at the latest.  
If the time window were doubled (to 22 weeks) probability would rise materially (≈ +10 pp) because summer mini-waves sometimes occur; if halved (to ~5 weeks) probability would drop (~ -6 pp).

d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (Laplace-adjusted): 16 %.  
Adjustments:  
– Current evidence of low/declining activity (moderate, -4 pp).  
– Short remaining window and need for strict monotonic increases (moderate, -3 pp).  
– Variant / reporting artefact tail risk (weak, +2 pp).  
Inside-view = 16 % – 4 % – 3 % + 2 % ≈ 11 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that roughly 11 out of 100 times, between now (mid-Feb) and 1 May an EU/EEA four-week strictly rising test-positivity streak would be observed in the ECDC ERVISS file.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Between now and 1 May 2026, will the ECDC EU/EEA SARS-CoV-2 test-positivity series contain any run of four consecutive weekly increases?  
2. Base rate: 16 %.  
3. Consistency: “11 out of 100 times the streak happens.” – matches rationale.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • 0/5 prior Feb-Apr seasons showed 4-week rise.  
   • Current UK, Greek, Italian data flat/declining.  
   • Only 11 weeks left; run must start by week 13.  
   • No rapid-growth variant detected; XFG still VUM.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden late-Feb variant-driven rebound beginning immediately could create the streak (would raise probability to >40 %).  
6. Status-quo outcome: continuation of post-winter decline favours “No”; slight nudge towards status quo already included.

Probability: 11%
