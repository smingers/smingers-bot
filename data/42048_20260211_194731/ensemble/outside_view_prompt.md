You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the ECDC weekly SARS-CoV-2 test positivity series show four consecutive week-over-week increases for the EU/EEA, before May 1, 2026?

Question background:
This forecasts whether European SARS-CoV-2 test positivity exhibits a sustained multi-week rise, which can signal accelerating transmission and pressure on health systems.

`{"format":"bot_tournament_question","info":{"hash_id":"f9ef3133013ffe25","sheet_id":189.1}}`

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves Yes if, after the time the question opens and before May 1, 2026, the EU/EEA weekly SARS-CoV-2 test positivity values in the ECDC/ERVISS weekly dataset contain at least one run of four consecutive reporting weeks where each week’s positivity is strictly greater than the immediately prior week’s positivity. The primary source is the ECDC/ERVISS weekly data CSV “SARITestsDetectionsPositivity.csv” (EU-ECDC GitHub), which must be used to evaluate week labels and positivity values: [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EU-ECDC/Respiratory\_viruses\_weekly\_data/refs/heads/main/data/SARITestsDetectionsPositivity.csv](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EU-ECDC/Respiratory_viruses_weekly_data/refs/heads/main/data/SARITestsDetectionsPositivity.csv).

## Summary of Article

**Source:** European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)  
**Date:** February 16, 2021

### Key Information:

**Main Topic:** This document describes ECDC's mapping of detection and characterization capability and capacity for SARS-CoV-2 variants across the EU/EEA region.

**Context:**
- This represents the fifth laboratory capacity survey conducted by ECDC since the COVID-19 pandemic began in December 2019
- The document is a suggested citation for ECDC's work on variant detection capabilities

**Relevant References:**
- The article mentions that ECDC provides surveillance information on COVID-19, including the European Respiratory Virus Surveillance Summary (ERVISS) and variants of concern
- ERVISS is specifically noted as part of ECDC's surveillance infrastructure for the COVID-19 pandemic

### Relevance to Forecasting Question:

This article establishes that ERVISS has been part of ECDC's surveillance system since at least early 2021, providing context for the data source referenced in the forecasting question. However, the article does not contain any specific statistics, test positivity data, or trends that would directly inform predictions about future test positivity patterns.

**Note:** This is a brief administrative/citation document rather than a detailed report with data or analysis. It primarily serves to document ECDC's surveillance capabilities rather than present findings.

## Summary of Article

**Source:** European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)  
**Date:** November 17, 2023  
**Status:** Archived content

### Key Facts:

1. **Dataset Description:** The ECDC provided a downloadable data file containing information about:
   - Volume of COVID-19 sequencing
   - Number and percentage distribution of variants of concern (VOC) by week and country
   - Data organized in long format (each row = country, variant, and week)

2. **Data Sources:** The dataset was based on:
   - GISAID EpiCoV database (https://www.gisaid.org/)
   - TESSy (The European Surveillance System) - submitted as either case-based or aggregate data

3. **Historical Coverage:** Data available from Week 40, 2020 onwards

4. **Dataset Discontinuation:** 
   - ECDC ceased updating this variant dataset on December 1, 2023
   - Final week of data included was Week 47, 2023

5. **Current Data Availability:** Weekly data linked to ERVISS is available on GitHub

### Relevance to Forecasting Question:

**Disclaimer:** This article describes a **discontinued dataset** about SARS-CoV-2 **variants**, not the test positivity data referenced in the forecasting question. The article mentions that weekly data linked to ERVISS is available on GitHub, but this specific archived page was about variant surveillance data that stopped being updated in December 2023. The forecasting question requires the "SARITestsDetectionsPositivity.csv" file for test positivity rates, which appears to be a different dataset within the ERVISS system.

# Summary of Article: "Flu cases surging in California as officials warn of powerful virus strain"

**Source:** Los Angeles Times  
**Date:** January 15, 2026  
**Author:** Karen Garcia

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **California-specific data:**
   - Flu test positivity rates have been rising in recent weeks, though still relatively low compared to last year's flu season
   - High rate of positive flu cases in Central California and Bay Area
   - Moderate rate around Sacramento and Southern California
   - Low rate in northern rural areas
   - Los Angeles County: Between end of 2025 and start of 2026, there were 162 flu-related hospitalizations and 18 ICU admissions

2. **National (U.S.) data:**
   - This flu season has led to the highest number of cases in the U.S. in more than 30 years
   - CDC estimates: At least 15 million infections, 180,000 hospitalizations, and 7,400 deaths since late fall
   - At least two pediatric deaths (confirmed to have occurred in California)

3. **Virus strain information:**
   - New influenza A strain: H3N2 subclade K
   - Strain emerged toward the end of summer, after flu vaccine formula was already determined
   - Believed to have mutated to "more likely evade" immunity from current vaccine
   - Has caused severe flu seasons in Australia, Japan, United Kingdom, and other parts of Europe and Asia

## Named Expert Opinions:

- **Dr. Elizabeth Hudson** (Kaiser Permanente regional physician chief of infectious diseases): Flu started rising by mid-December; hoping to see plateauing in next few weeks; most cases treated without hospitalization, but older/higher-risk patients being admitted
- **Dr. Erica Pan** (state public health officer): Current seasonal flu vaccines remain effective at reducing severe illness and hospitalization
- **Dr. Michelle Barron** (UCHealth): Flu shot lessens odds of severe case, keeps people out of hospital, shortens illness duration
- **Dr. Neha Nanda** (Keck Medicine of USC): Seeing early upward trend in positive influenza cases compared to previous years, though not quite on par with last year
- **Dr. Sam Torbati** (Cedars-Sinai Medical Center): Saw surge in flu-related patients around second week of December; doesn't recall "seeing this many patients becoming this ill"

## Relevance to Forecasting Question:

**This article is NOT directly relevant** to the forecasting question, as it discusses **influenza (flu)** cases and test positivity, not SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) test positivity in the EU/EEA region. The article focuses on California and U.S. flu data, not European COVID-19 data.

<Agent_report>
Query: Download ECDC SARSITestsDetectionsPositivity.csv then compute all four-week strictly increasing streaks for EU/EEA; report dates and most recent occurrence
Objective recap  
The forecasters want to know whether the EU/EEA-level SARS-CoV-2 test-positivity series produced weekly by the ECDC/ERVISS has ever – or will in the future – display a run (“streak”) of four consecutive weeks in which the reported EU/EEA positivity value is strictly larger than the week immediately before.  
Your immediate task was narrower: using the historical data now available in the official CSV
 https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EU-ECDC/Respiratory_viruses_weekly_data/refs/heads/main/data/SARITestsDetectionsPositivity.csv  
identify every such four-week strictly increasing streak in the EU/EEA column, list the start-and-end ISO-week labels for each streak, and highlight the most recent time a streak of that length occurred.

What the search turned up  
1. The GitHub “raw” URL above – referenced in the tournament resolution criteria – is the authoritative machine-readable file. It was not mirrored at any of the sites returned by Google or Google-News, but the link is openly accessible (no paywall or sign-in) and routinely updated each Thursday afternoon by ECDC.  
2. No secondary source (news article, blog post, dashboard) published a pre-calculated list of positivity streaks; therefore, the streaks must be computed directly from the CSV.  
3. None of the search results provide even an excerpt of the EU/EEA weekly positivity numbers, so the actual numerical values and week labels are still missing from our working notes.

Why the information is still incomplete  
Because the CSV has not yet been downloaded and parsed in this research thread, we still lack:  
• the full ordered list of ISO week labels used by ECDC (e.g. “2024-W45”) for EU/EEA;  
• the corresponding numeric positivity values (percentage of sentinel tests positive for SARS-CoV-2);  
• the derived streak table showing every four-week strictly increasing run.  
Without those three items we cannot satisfy the original request or inform forecasters on how recently the last qualifying streak occurred.

Exact data needed next  
A single pull of the file plus a ~10-line pandas script (or equivalent spreadsheet steps) will supply everything:

python pseudo-code
------------------
import pandas as pd, numpy as np
url = ".../SARITestsDetectionsPositivity.csv"
df  = pd.read_csv(url)

eu = df[df['country_code']=='EU/EEA']    # filter row
eu = eu.sort_values('year_week')         # make sure weeks in order

eu['up']      = eu['percent_pos'].diff()>0               # True if week-over-week increase
eu['streakID']= (~eu['up']).cumsum()                     # assign streak id
eu['streakLen']=eu.groupby('streakID').cumcount()+1      # length within streak
four_up = eu[(eu['up']) & (eu['streakLen']>=4)]          # rows that finish 4-wk run
# collapse each streak to start / end
out = four_up.groupby('streakID').agg(start=('year_week','first'),
                                      end=('year_week','last'))
--------------------------------------

That will yield the complete list and, by taking the max(end), the most recent four-week strictly rising episode.

Conclusion & next steps  
All evidence points to the CSV itself as the only source that can answer the query; no public web page has the streak calculations pre-done. Therefore:

• Remaining gap: the CSV has not yet been processed.  
• Action needed: run the quick extraction script (or spreadsheet equivalent) against the live file, then paste the resulting streak table.  
• Once that is done, we will know (a) whether any four-week streaks have ever happened, (b) exactly when, and (c) the date of the most recent occurrence – the critical datum for the tournament forecast baseline.

No further open-web searching is likely to substitute for actually reading the CSV, so no additional Google queries are proposed at this point.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
