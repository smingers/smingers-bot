Analysis:
The forecast hinges on whether the ECDC/ERVISS dataset will shortly show a four-week streak of rising SARS-CoV-2 test positivity in the EU/EEA. To judge likelihood, I need:  
• The most recent values in the “SARITestsDetectionsPositivity.csv” file (often discussed on GitHub or mirrored in ECDC technical reports).  
• News or commentary indicating recent upward trends in Europe’s COVID test positivity, especially early-2026 surveillance notes.  
• Expert or public-health commentary on drivers of current EU/EEA transmission that could sustain multiple weeks of growth.

Hence queries target: (1) the raw dataset update, (2) press or specialist coverage of the weekly ECDC respiratory virus bulletin, and (3) broader news analysis of current EU/EEA positivity increases.
