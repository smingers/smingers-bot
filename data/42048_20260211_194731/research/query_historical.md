Analysis:
To judge the likelihood of another four-week positivity streak, I first need historical evidence of how often such streaks have happened in the ECDC/ERVISS data, when they tended to occur (e.g., winter waves), and whether the current 2025-26 season is already trending upward. Therefore the most relevant information is:  
1) The structure and content of the “SARITestsDetectionsPositivity.csv” file and any analyses already performed on that series.  
2) News or recent commentary indicating whether EU/EEA test positivity has been rising in early 2026.  
3) A quick quantitative scan (via Agent) of the dataset to count past four-week runs and report the most recent one.
