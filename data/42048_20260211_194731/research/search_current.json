She stressed that achieving at least 95% two-dose vaccination coverage is essential to protect vulnerable populations, including infants too young for vaccination and those with medical contraindications. Measles is one of the most contagious viruses known, with each case potentially infecting up to 18 others\u201412 times more transmissible than influenza. It can cause long-term immune damage, increasing susceptibility to other infections and death. WHO warns there is no specific treatment for measles, and recovery typically takes two weeks.

Six European countries\u2014Armenia, Austria, Azerbaijan, Spain, the UK, and Uzbekistan\u2014lost their measles-free status in 2024 due to sustained transmission for over a year, according to WHO.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 11, 2026 01:19 PM\nSource:[Euronews Espa\u00f1ol](https://es.euronews.com/salud/2026/02/11/sarampion-expertos-alertan-de-que-las-dudas-vacunales-avivan-su-expansion-en-europa)\n\n**Measles in Europe: Cases Decline in 2025, but Alert Remains High**\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported a decline in measles cases across the EU/EEA region in 2025 compared to 2024, with 7,655 infections and 8 deaths recorded in France, Romania, and the Netherlands. Despite this decrease, the numbers remain double those of 2023. The highly contagious airborne virus disproportionately affects unvaccinated individuals, with 8 out of 10 infected persons having not received the vaccine. ECDC's Sabrina Bacci emphasized the urgency of action ahead of the seasonal peak in late winter and early spring, stating: 'We have a highly effective and safe vaccine. Individual vaccination protects those who cannot be vaccinated by reducing transmission, making it not only self-protection but also solidarity.' The ECDC stresses that a 95% two-dose vaccination coverage is essential to halt transmission and protect vulnerable populations, with the ultimate goal of eliminating measles through collective, informed prevention.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 11, 2026 08:56 AM\nSource:[MeteoWeb](https://www.meteoweb.eu/2026/02/morbillo-in-europa-contagi-in-calo-nel-2025-ma-lallerta-resta-alta/1001895279/)\n\n**UE Reports Over 7,600 Measles Cases in 2025; Portugal Records 21 Cases Amid High Vaccination Coverage**\nIn 2025, the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) reported 7,655 confirmed cases of measles across 30 European Union (EU) and European Economic Area (EEA) countries, with eight deaths recorded\u2014four in France, three in Romania, and one in the Netherlands. Portugal reported 21 confirmed cases, with approximately half occurring in March. The country maintained high vaccination coverage, with 99% receiving the first dose and 96% receiving the second dose\u2014levels consistent over recent years. Romania reported the highest number of cases (4,198), followed by France (877), the Netherlands (534), Italy (529), and Spain (426), while Malta, Iceland, and Liechtenstein reported no confirmed cases. Preliminary data show a significant decline in cases compared to 2024, though numbers remain double those of 2023. Of all cases, 40.1% (3,072) were in children under five, and 34.9% (2,674) were in individuals aged 15 or older. Of the confirmed infections, 79.9% (5,764) occurred in unvaccinated individuals\u2014about eight in ten\u2014while 10.3% (743) had received one dose and 7.9% (571) were fully vaccinated with two or more doses. The ECDC emphasized that at least 95% of eligible individuals should be vaccinated with two doses to prevent outbreaks and protect vulnerable groups such as infants and those with medical contraindications. The ECDC noted that Europe should lead globally in eliminating measles, citing an effective and safe vaccine, strong surveillance systems, and available resources. The disease, caused by a virus, presents with fever, cough, conjunctivitis, runny nose, and a red rash, and spreads via respiratory droplets. While often mild, it can lead to severe complications or death in some cases. The ECDC urged all individuals to check their measles vaccination status, especially as infection rates typically peak in late winter and early spring.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 09:11 PM\nSource:[SAPO](https://sapo.pt/artigo/ue-com-mais-de-sete-mil-casos-de-sarampo-em-portugal-foram-21-com-dgs-a-salientar-cobertura-vacinal-elevada-698a4dd5dedd7e970e351434)\n\n**EODY: 104 new Covid-19 admissions and 7 new deaths in the last week - ProtoThema English**\nAccording to the EODY epidemiological report for December 1\u20137, 2025, influenza activity is increasing in the community, with community flu positivity above the epidemic threshold, indicating the start of seasonal flu. Over the past two months, 45 positive flu samples were detected from 1,377 tested, all of type A. Two new severe influenza cases required ICU hospitalization, with no new deaths from laboratory-confirmed flu; one additional severe ICU case was retrospectively reported from the previous week. SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) cases remain stable: positivity rates across all tests are unchanged, with 104 new hospital admissions (down from 131 the prior week), no new intubations, and seven new deaths reported. Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) cases per 1,000 visits remain low and show a slight decrease. Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) positivity remains low with only sporadic cases detected in both community and hospital networks. The ECDC assesses the risk of A(H3) K subclade as moderate for the general population and high for high-risk groups. Vaccination is recommended as the best preventive measure, and high-risk individuals are urged to seek medical care promptly if flu-like symptoms appear for timely antiviral treatment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 11, 2025 04:24 PM\nSource:[protothemanews.com](https://en.protothema.gr/2025/12/11/eody-104-new-covid-19-admissions-and-7-new-deaths-in-the-last-week/)\n\n**RespiVirNet Surveillance: Rise in Acute Respiratory Infections Amid Revised Case Definition**\nThe RespiVirNet surveillance report for the week of November 24\u201330, 2025, indicates a rise in acute respiratory infections (ARI) in the community, with an incidence rate of 10.4 cases per 1,000 individuals, up from 8.96 in the previous week. Approximately 585,000 new cases were estimated, bringing the total since surveillance began to about 3.3 million. The highest incidence was observed in children aged 0\u20134 years, at 33 cases per 1,000 individuals. Incidence intensity remains low across most regions, with baseline levels in Liguria, Molise, Trento province, and Umbria. The report notes that the shift from monitoring Influenza-Like Illnesses (ILI) to Acute Respiratory Infections (ARI) complicates comparisons with prior seasons, as the new definition is broader and aligns with the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). Among respiratory viruses, the highest positivity rates were recorded for influenza (423 positive cases: 421 type A, 2 type B), SARS-CoV-2 (83 cases, 4.0%), Rhinovirus (275 cases, 13.2%), Respiratory Syncytial Virus (51 cases, 2%), Parainfluenza viruses (69 cases, 3.3%), Adenovirus (56 cases, 2.7%), other human coronaviruses (37 cases, 2.7%), Bocavirus (16 cases, 0.8%), and Metapneumovirus (6 cases, 0.3%). No samples tested positive for non-subtypable influenza A, which may suggest the absence of seasonal influenza strains or possible avian influenza circulation. The new ARI definition, now used in the RespiVirNet surveillance system starting in the 2025\u20132026 season, expands monitoring to include a wider range of respiratory pathogens beyond influenza, improving consistency with European standards.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: December 05, 2025 10:32 AM\nSource:[cronacamilano.it](https://cronacamilano.it/salute-benessere/93220-respivirnet-ultima-settimana-373mila-casi-di-sindromi-simil-influenzali.html)\n\n**Respiratory viruses start circulating surprisingly early this year**\nRespiratory viruses, particularly influenza, are circulating earlier than usual in European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) countries, with detections three to four weeks ahead of the two most recent seasons, according to the European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC). The emerging A(H3N2) subclade K (formerly J.2.4.1) is driving the surge, now detected globally and accounting for a third of all A(H3N2) sequences in GISAID between May and November 2025, and nearly half in the EU/EEA. This strain has not been dominant in recent seasons, potentially leading to lower population immunity. ECDC warns that low vaccine uptake could result in a more severe influenza season, increasing pressure on healthcare systems. Edoardo Colzani, Head of Section Respiratory Viruses at ECDC, emphasizes: 'We are seeing influenza detections increasing much earlier than usual this year, and that means time is critical. If you are eligible for vaccination, please don't wait.' Test positivity is highest in children aged 5\u201314, consistent with early seasonal activity. The ECDC estimates that influenza causes up to 50 million symptomatic cases and 15,000\u201370,000 deaths annually in Europe, with children being primary transmitters. While most infections are self-limiting, individuals at higher risk\u2014including those over 65, people with chronic conditions, immunocompromised individuals, pregnant people, and those in long-term care facilities\u2014are at moderate to high risk of severe disease, hospitalization, and death. The A(H3N2) subclade K vaccine is still expected to provide protection against severe outcomes. Additionally, a new coronavirus variant, XFG\u2014a recombination of LF.7 and LP.8.1.2\u2014has been identified in Hungary and classified as a 'variant under monitoring' (VUM) by WHO and ECDC, with a currently low risk assessment. Symptoms like sore throat and hoarseness are not specific to XFG and cannot reliably distinguish it from other respiratory infections. The ECDC estimates the overall risk to the general population as moderate, but high for vulnerable groups.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 21, 2025 11:20 AM\nSource:[Portfolio.hu](https://www.portfolio.hu/en/economy/20251121/respiratory-viruses-start-circulating-surprisingly-early-this-year-801184)\n\n**ECDC urges immediate uptake of flu vaccination**\nThe European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) has issued an urgent call for immediate influenza vaccination across EU/EEA countries due to an unusually early rise in flu cases. According to a threat assessment released on November 20, 2025, influenza activity is emerging three to four weeks earlier than in the previous two seasons, primarily driven by a newly emerged influenza A(H3N2) subclade known as subclade K. Edoardo Colzani, Head of Respiratory Viruses at the ECDC, emphasized the urgency, stating, 'We are seeing influenza detections increasing much earlier than usual this year, and that means time is critical.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 08:25 PM\nSource:[EU Reporter](https://www.eureporter.co/health/2025/11/20/ecdc-urges-immediate-uptake-of-flu-vaccination/)\n\n**Influenza Cases on the Rise: ECDC Warns of Early, Potentially Severe Season, Urges Immediate Vaccination**\nInfluenza cases in the European Union/European Economic Area (EU/EEA) are rising earlier than usual, with an advance of 3 to 4 weeks compared to the two most recent seasons. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC) warns that Europe may face a more severe flu season than in the past, especially if vaccination coverage remains low. The increase is driven by a newly emerged influenza strain, the K subclade of influenza A(H3N2). Edoardo Colzani, ECDC's respiratory viruses lead, emphasized that due to the early surge, timely vaccination is critical: 'If you are eligible for vaccination, do not delay. Getting vaccinated now is one of the most effective ways to protect yourself and those around you from severe illness this winter.' The ECDC recommends that healthcare and long-term care facilities strengthen infection prevention and control plans, encourage mask use during peak respiratory virus circulation, and promote rapid antiviral treatment for high-risk patients. Additionally, antiviral prophylaxis should be considered during outbreaks in closed settings, and countries should launch clear, targeted communication campaigns on vaccination, hand hygiene, and respiratory etiquette to reduce community transmission.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: November 20, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[La Sentinella del Canavese](https://lasentinella.gelocal.it/salute/2025/11/20/news/influenza_casi_in_aumento_vaccini-424993808/)\n\n**Two serious cases of influenza in ICU, no deaths from coronavirus in the last week - The EODY report - ProtoThema English**\nAccording to the HHS respiratory infections report for the week of 22\u201328 September 2025, no deaths from coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) were recorded. However, two new severe cases of influenza were reported, both resulting in ICU hospitalization, with no new deaths from laboratory-confirmed influenza. The number of flu-like illness (ILI) cases per 1,000 visits remained low with a slight weekly increase. Severe Acute Respiratory Infection (SARI) cases per 1,000 visits also remained low, with a small rise during the week. SARS-CoV-2 positivity increased compared to the previous week, with one new intubation recorded and no new deaths. The report notes the co-circulation of LP.8.1, NB.1.8.1, and XFG variants (under monitoring by ECDC and WHO/EURO), with XFG showing a gradual trend toward predominance; no evidence of increased severity was found. Municipal wastewater viral load was at moderate levels nationally, with a rise from the prior week and variation across cities. Community influenza positivity remained below the 10% epidemic threshold, and secondary healthcare positivity stayed very low. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) activity remained at very low levels in both community and hospital settings, with only sporadic positive cases detected.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 02, 2025 03:11 PM\nSource:[protothemanews.com](https://en.protothema.gr/2025/10/02/two-serious-cases-of-influenza-in-icu-no-deaths-from-coronavirus-in-the-last-week-the-eody-report/)\n\n**Post\u2011COVID Wastewater Surveillance Could Expand to Other Viruses in France**\nFrance\u2019s wastewater monitoring, which has tracked SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 for four years, is now being expanded to other respiratory viruses such as influenza and bronchiolitis, announced Anses and Sant\u00e9 publique France. Since September\u202f2021, samples from 54 treatment plants across the country\u2014including Nice and Cap Sici\u00e9\u2014are collected weekly and sent to four laboratories that test for the virus. The data complement hospital and emergency department records and have already recorded seven peaks of circulation, as the agencies note: 'sept pics de circulation du virus ont \u00e9t\u00e9 enregistr\u00e9s en France'.  Christophe\u202fCordevant explains that an increase in SARS\u2011CoV\u20112 detection in wastewater can precede a rise in emergency consultations by several days, allowing authorities to anticipate epidemic waves and mobilise resources: 'augmentation de la d\u00e9tection du virus du Covid\u201119 dans les eaux us\u00e9es peut pr\u00e9c\u00e9der de plusieurs jours l'augmentation des consultations aux urgences pour Covid'.  The success of the system has led to plans to extend surveillance to other pathogens, including influenza, bronchiolitis, and the measles virus using a new sensitive method.  The project will help France implement the EU directive on wastewater surveillance and integrate indicators at the European level via the ECDC.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 04:22 PM\nSource:[Nice-Matin](https://www.nicematin.com/sante/apres-le-covid-la-surveillance-des-eaux-usees-pourrait-etre-etendue-a-d-autres-virus-en-france-10649638)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
