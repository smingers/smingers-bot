However, the article does not contain any specific statistics, test positivity data, or trends that would directly inform predictions about future test positivity patterns.\n\n**Note:** This is a brief administrative/citation document rather than a detailed report with data or analysis. It primarily serves to document ECDC's surveillance capabilities rather than present findings.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data/data-virus-variants-covid-19-eueea\">\n## Summary of Article\n\n**Source:** European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control (ECDC)  \n**Date:** November 17, 2023  \n**Status:** Archived content\n\n### Key Facts:\n\n1. **Dataset Description:** The ECDC provided a downloadable data file containing information about:\n   - Volume of COVID-19 sequencing\n   - Number and percentage distribution of variants of concern (VOC) by week and country\n   - Data organized in long format (each row = country, variant, and week)\n\n2. **Data Sources:** The dataset was based on:\n   - GISAID EpiCoV database (https://www.gisaid.org/)\n   - TESSy (The European Surveillance System) - submitted as either case-based or aggregate data\n\n3. **Historical Coverage:** Data available from Week 40, 2020 onwards\n\n4. **Dataset Discontinuation:** \n   - ECDC ceased updating this variant dataset on December 1, 2023\n   - Final week of data included was Week 47, 2023\n\n5. **Current Data Availability:** Weekly data linked to ERVISS is available on GitHub\n\n### Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\n**Disclaimer:** This article describes a **discontinued dataset** about SARS-CoV-2 **variants**, not the test positivity data referenced in the forecasting question. The article mentions that weekly data linked to ERVISS is available on GitHub, but this specific archived page was about variant surveillance data that stopped being updated in December 2023. The forecasting question requires the \"SARITestsDetectionsPositivity.csv\" file for test positivity rates, which appears to be a different dataset within the ERVISS system.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://atlas.ecdc.europa.eu/\">\n# Summary of Article\n\n**Disclaimer**: The extracted content appears to be primarily navigation elements and interface text from the ECDC Surveillance Atlas of Infectious Diseases website, rather than substantive article content with data, analysis, or expert opinions.\n\n## Key Observations:\n\n**Content Type**: This appears to be a web interface/dashboard page rather than a traditional article. The extracted text consists mainly of:\n- Menu options and navigation elements\n- Data export functionality descriptions (CSV file options, screenshot capture)\n- Interface controls (time period selectors, region filters, indicator selections)\n- Attribution to \"Instant Atlas\u2122\" mapping/visualization software\n\n**Relevant Information**: \n- The page is hosted at Atlas.ecdc.europa.eu, which is the ECDC's surveillance data platform\n- It offers functionality to:\n  - Filter data by time periods\n  - Select specific regions\n  - Export data in CSV format\n  - View indicators and distributions\n\n**Missing Content**: The extraction does not contain:\n- Any actual COVID-19/SARS-CoV-2 test positivity data\n- Statistics or trends\n- Expert opinions or analysis\n- Specific information about current or historical test positivity rates\n- Any substantive content that would help forecast the question at hand\n\n**Note**: To obtain useful information for the forecasting question, the actual data CSV file from the GitHub repository mentioned in the resolution criteria would need to be accessed directly, rather than this web interface page.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-025-03412-x\">\n# Summary of Article: \"COVID-19 is spreading again \u2014 how serious is it and what are the symptoms?\"\n\n**Source:** Nature  \n**Date:** November 04, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Global case increase:** SARS-CoV-2 infections have been rising in the past month. Global cases increased by more than 19,000 last month compared with the previous month, according to data from the World Health Organization (WHO) COVID-19 dashboard.\n\n## Note:\nThe extracted content appears to be incomplete - the article title suggests it should contain information about the seriousness of the spread and symptoms, but the provided text cuts off after the opening paragraph and transitions into what appears to be job listings/advertisements.

The article focuses on California and U.S. flu data, not European COVID-19 data.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Download ECDC SARSITestsDetectionsPositivity.csv then compute all four-week strictly increasing streaks for EU/EEA; report dates and most recent occurrence\nObjective recap  \nThe forecasters want to know whether the EU/EEA-level SARS-CoV-2 test-positivity series produced weekly by the ECDC/ERVISS has ever \u2013 or will in the future \u2013 display a run (\u201cstreak\u201d) of four consecutive weeks in which the reported EU/EEA positivity value is strictly larger than the week immediately before.  \nYour immediate task was narrower: using the historical data now available in the official CSV\n\u2003https://raw.githubusercontent.com/EU-ECDC/Respiratory_viruses_weekly_data/refs/heads/main/data/SARITestsDetectionsPositivity.csv  \nidentify every such four-week strictly increasing streak in the EU/EEA column, list the start-and-end ISO-week labels for each streak, and highlight the most recent time a streak of that length occurred.\n\nWhat the search turned up  \n1. The GitHub \u201craw\u201d URL above \u2013 referenced in the tournament resolution criteria \u2013 is the authoritative machine-readable file. It was not mirrored at any of the sites returned by Google or Google-News, but the link is openly accessible (no paywall or sign-in) and routinely updated each Thursday afternoon by ECDC.  \n2. No secondary source (news article, blog post, dashboard) published a pre-calculated list of positivity streaks; therefore, the streaks must be computed directly from the CSV.  \n3. None of the search results provide even an excerpt of the EU/EEA weekly positivity numbers, so the actual numerical values and week labels are still missing from our working notes.\n\nWhy the information is still incomplete  \nBecause the CSV has not yet been downloaded and parsed in this research thread, we still lack:  \n\u2022 the full ordered list of ISO week labels used by ECDC (e.g. \u201c2024-W45\u201d) for EU/EEA;  \n\u2022 the corresponding numeric positivity values (percentage of sentinel tests positive for SARS-CoV-2);  \n\u2022 the derived streak table showing every four-week strictly increasing run.  \nWithout those three items we cannot satisfy the original request or inform forecasters on how recently the last qualifying streak occurred.\n\nExact data needed next  \nA single pull of the file plus a ~10-line pandas script (or equivalent spreadsheet steps) will supply everything:\n\npython pseudo-code\n------------------\nimport pandas as pd, numpy as np\nurl = \".../SARITestsDetectionsPositivity.csv\"\ndf  = pd.read_csv(url)\n\neu = df[df['country_code']=='EU/EEA']    # filter row\neu = eu.sort_values('year_week')         # make sure weeks in order\n\neu['up']      = eu['percent_pos'].diff()>0               # True if week-over-week increase\neu['streakID']= (~eu['up']).cumsum()                     # assign streak id\neu['streakLen']=eu.groupby('streakID').cumcount()+1      # length within streak\nfour_up = eu[(eu['up']) & (eu['streakLen']>=4)]          # rows that finish 4-wk run\n# collapse each streak to start / end\nout = four_up.groupby('streakID').agg(start=('year_week','first'),\n                                      end=('year_week','last'))\n--------------------------------------\n\nThat will yield the complete list and, by taking the max(end), the most recent four-week strictly rising episode.\n\nConclusion & next steps  \nAll evidence points to the CSV itself as the only source that can answer the query; no public web page has the streak calculations pre-done. Therefore:\n\n\u2022 Remaining gap: the CSV has not yet been processed.  \n\u2022 Action needed: run the quick extraction script (or spreadsheet equivalent) against the live file, then paste the resulting streak table.  \n\u2022 Once that is done, we will know (a) whether any four-week streaks have ever happened, (b) exactly when, and (c) the date of the most recent occurrence \u2013 the critical datum for the tournament forecast baseline.\n\nNo further open-web searching is likely to substitute for actually reading the CSV, so no additional Google queries are proposed at this point.</Agent_report>\n"
