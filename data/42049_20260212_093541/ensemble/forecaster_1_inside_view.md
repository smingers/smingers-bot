Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**CDC Official Data (Feb 6, 2026)**: Primary resolution source. Reports 733 confirmed U.S. cases as of Feb 5, 2026. Highest quality - this is the exact source used for resolution. Factual data with clear methodology.

**North Carolina DPH (Feb 10, 2026)**: State-level data showing 18 NC cases since December 2025. High quality primary source but limited geographic scope. Factual case counts with vaccination status breakdown.

**UCLA Health (Feb 9, 2026)**: Dr. Sanchi Malhotra (named expert, UCLA professor) provides expert opinion on transmission dynamics. Cites 733 cases for 2026, consistent with CDC. Factual case counts; expert opinion on epidemiology is credible.

**USA Today (Feb 10, 2026)**: Reports "more than 500 cases" nationally but later clarifies South Carolina specifically has 546 cases. Dr. Mehmet Oz (CMS administrator, named source) urges vaccination. Factual case counts; Oz's statement is expert opinion supporting vaccination.

**ABC News (Feb 11, 2026)**: Reports 733 cases, cites Dr. Demetre Daskalakis (former CDC official, named expert) on low vaccination rates. Factual CDC data; expert opinion on outbreak drivers.

**AskNews Articles (Feb 11-12, 2026)**: Multiple sources reporting 733 cases nationally as of Feb 5-11. The New Republic reports "over 800 additional cases" by Feb 11 (citing Center for Outbreak Response Innovation, not CDC). U.S. News reports "over 800 cases across 23 states by February 11." Medical Xpress confirms 733 CDC cases. **Critical discrepancy**: Some sources cite 733 (CDC official), others cite 800+ (possibly different counting methodology or timing). I weight CDC official data most heavily.

**Mexico outbreak data**: 9,074 cases in Mexico since Jan 2025, 28 deaths. Relevant for cross-border transmission risk but doesn't directly inform U.S. count.

**Key factual evidence**:
- CDC official: 733 cases as of Feb 5, 2026 (36 days into year)
- 92% outbreak-associated (662 from 2025 outbreaks, 9 from new 2026 outbreaks)
- South Carolina: 546-605 cases (largest single outbreak)
- 20 states reporting cases
- 2025 total: 2,276 cases (30-year high)
- Vaccination coverage: 92.5% (below 95% herd immunity threshold)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence (large shifts warranted)**:
1. **Current trajectory significantly exceeds 2025**: 733 cases in 36 days = 20.4 cases/day vs. 2025's 6.2 cases/day average. Multiple independent sources (CDC, state health departments, news outlets) confirm this. This is a 3.3× acceleration.
   - *Direction*: Strongly upward from 2025 base rate

2. **Sustained community transmission**: 92% outbreak-associated with 662 cases from continuing 2025 outbreaks. CDC data shows this isn't isolated importations but sustained chains. Historical pattern: when outbreaks become this entrenched, they take months to control.
   - *Direction*: Upward, suggests continued growth

3. **Vaccination coverage below herd immunity threshold**: 92.5% vs. 95% required. Multiple expert sources (UCLA, CDC) confirm this structural vulnerability. This is a difficult-to-change institutional factor.
   - *Direction*: Upward, enables continued transmission

**Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)**:
1. **South Carolina outbreak still growing**: 546-605 cases by Feb 5-10, described as "largest in recent memory" with "hundreds infected in latest outbreak." Single state but represents 75-80% of national count. Growth pattern suggests not yet peaked.
   - *Direction*: Upward for near-term (next 2-3 weeks)

2. **Seasonal timing**: Entering traditional measles peak season (March-May). Historical pattern shows spring amplification. However, this is indirect - modern outbreaks don't always follow seasonal patterns strictly.
   - *Direction*: Moderate upward

3. **Public health response intensifying**: Quarantines, contact tracing, vaccination campaigns mentioned across sources. However, effectiveness uncertain given scale.
   - *Direction*: Moderate downward (control measures)

**Weak evidence**:
1. **Expert warnings about elimination status**: PAHO meeting in April to assess. This is about classification, not directly predictive of case counts.
2. **Mexico outbreak**: 9,074 cases, but cross-border transmission risk is speculative for this timeframe.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: Feb 12 to Apr 24, 2026 = 71 days (10.1 weeks)

**Current trend continuation**: 
- 733 cases + (71 days × 20.4 cases/day) = 2,181 cases

**If timeframe halved (35 days to ~Mar 19)**:
- Less time for outbreak control measures to work
- Still in peak season
- Would predict: 733 + (35 × 18) = ~1,363 cases
- Higher daily rate maintained due to momentum

**If timeframe doubled (142 days to ~Jul 7)**:
- More time for control measures and outbreak burnout
- Past peak season into summer
- Would predict: 733 + (142 × 12) = ~2,436 cases
- Lower daily rate as outbreaks controlled

The 71-day timeframe is long enough for some outbreak control but short enough that current momentum matters significantly.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view established**: 10th: 1,100 | 50th: ~2,000 | 90th: 3,200

**Key factors warranting adjustment**:

1. **More recent data point (Feb 5 vs. Jan 30)**: The outside view used 588 cases on Jan 30. We now have 733 cases on Feb 5 - that's 145 additional cases in 6 days (24.2 cases/day). This is even higher than the 20.4/day average calculated over 36 days. This suggests acceleration, not deceleration.
   - *Impact*: Shift median upward ~10%

2. **South Carolina outbreak trajectory**: The outside view acknowledged SC as major driver, but recent sources (Feb 10) show it's still growing actively ("hundreds infected in latest outbreak"). With 546-605 cases already and no peak visible, this single outbreak could add 400-800 more cases by April 24.
   - *Impact*: Shift median upward ~5-10%

3. **Outbreak control evidence**: The outside view noted "public health response intensifying" but actual evidence of effectiveness is limited. No sources show declining case rates or successful containment. The 92% outbreak-association rate is unchanged.
   - *Impact*: Less downward pressure than outside view assumed; shift median upward ~5%

4. **Seasonal peak timing**: We're entering March-May peak season. The outside view acknowledged this but may have underweighted it. Historical measles outbreaks show 2-3× amplification during peak months.
   - *Impact*: Moderate upward shift, especially for upper percentiles

**Counterbalancing factors**:
- No evidence of new major outbreaks beyond the 2 reported (only 9 cases)
- Media attention may drive vaccination uptake
- Outbreak burnout will eventually occur

**Net assessment**: Current evidence suggests the outside view was slightly conservative. The acceleration from 588 (Jan 30) to 733 (Feb 5) indicates momentum is stronger than the outside view's moderate scenario assumed. However, the upper tail (3,200) already accounts for continued acceleration, so I'll shift the distribution upward but keep wide tails.

## Distribution Calibration

**Recalibrated thinking**:

**Lower tail (10th percentile)**: For this to occur, the outbreak would need to peak immediately and decline rapidly. Given 145 cases in 6 days (Feb 5-10 implied), this seems unlikely. Even aggressive control would take 2-3 weeks to show effect. Minimum plausible: 733 + (71 × 8) = 1,301. Set 10th at **1,300**.

**20th percentile**: Outbreak peaks by early March, rate drops to ~12/day average. 733 + (71 × 12) = 1,585. Set at **1,600**.

**40th percentile**: Outbreak peaks mid-March, rate averages ~15/day. 733 + (71 × 15) = 1,798. Set at **1,850**.

**60th percentile (median)**: Current rate continues for 3-4 weeks then moderates. Average ~18/day. 733 + (71 × 18) = 2,011. Set at **2,100**.

**80th percentile**: Rate continues at 20-22/day through March, slow decline in April. 733 + (71 × 22) = 2,295. Set at **2,400**.

**90th percentile**: Acceleration continues, new outbreaks emerge, seasonal peak amplifies. Rate increases to 25-30/day. 733 + (71 × 28) = 2,721. Additional outbreak scenarios could push to 3,000+. Set at **3,000**.

**Consistency check**: Median ~2,100 implies ~19.3 cases/day average over 71 days, which is slightly below current 20.4/day but accounts for some control measures. Mean would be ~2,100-2,200 given right skew. This aligns with "current momentum with gradual moderation" scenario.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: CDC-reported cumulative confirmed U.S. measles cases for 2026 as of April 24, 2026 (units: cases). ✓ Analysis focused on this exact metric.

2. **Base rate**: Outside view: 10th: 1,100 | 50th: ~2,000 | 90th: 3,200. Inside view shifted upward ~5-10% based on stronger recent momentum (733 on Feb 5 vs. 588 on Jan 30). ✓ Rooted in base rate with justified adjustments.

3. **Consistency**: Implied median = 2,100; mean ≈ 2,150. This represents 19.3 cases/day average, slightly below current 20.4/day, reflecting expected moderation from control measures. ✓ Reasonable given evidence.

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - 733 cases as of Feb 5 (CDC official data) - factually verified ✓
   - 145 cases added in 6 days (Jan 30 to Feb 5) = 24.2/day acceleration - calculated from CDC data ✓
   - SC outbreak 546-605 cases, still growing actively - multiple sources confirm ✓
   - 92% outbreak-associated, 662 from 2025 chains - CDC data ✓
   - Vaccination 92.5% < 95% threshold - CDC/expert consensus ✓

5. **Blind spot**: Aggressive federal/state intervention (emergency vaccination campaigns, school closures) could rapidly suppress transmission, making my forecast look too high. This would push outcome DOWN to 1,200-1,500 range.

6. **Status quo**: Current rate is 20.4 cases/day. Status quo continuation = 2,181 by Apr 24. My median (2,100) is slightly below this, reflecting modest control measures. Given high momentum and 71-day timeframe, this seems appropriate - not too aggressive on control assumptions.

7. **Technicalities**: Values strictly increasing ✓. Units in cases ✓. All values between bounds (588-10,000) ✓. 10th-90th range (1,300-3,000) is 2.3× spread, appropriately wide for uncertainty.
