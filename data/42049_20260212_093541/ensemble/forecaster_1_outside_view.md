Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**CDC Measles Cases and Outbreaks (Feb 6, 2026)**: Primary authoritative source. Reports 733 confirmed U.S. cases as of Feb 5, 2026. This is the official resolution source for the question. High quality, most recent data. Factual reporting of case counts and outbreak statistics.

**NBC News (Feb 6, 2026)**: News article citing CDC data. Reports >700 cases in 2026, consistent with CDC. Notes South Carolina as epicenter with >500 in quarantine. Quality secondary source aggregating CDC data with journalistic context.

**CDC Global Measles Outbreaks (Feb 11, 2026)**: Provides global context showing measles activity rising worldwide. Factual data on international outbreaks. Relevant for understanding import risk but doesn't provide U.S. 2026 numbers.

**South Carolina DPH (Feb 10, 2026)**: State-level data reporting 933 cases in SC outbreak centered in Spartanburg County as of Feb 10, 2026. High-quality primary source for state data. This is a subset of national count and represents the largest single outbreak.

**Stanford Medicine Expert Opinion (Jan 28, 2026)**: Dr. Sruti Nadimpalli provides expert context on transmission dynamics and vaccine requirements. Notes 2,255 cases in 2025 (slight discrepancy with CDC's 2,276, likely timing of data). Expert opinion on epidemiology is credible; case counts are factual citations.

**Asheville Citizen Times Opinion (Feb 11, 2026)**: Dr. Bindu Mayi (immunology professor) cites 2,242 cases in 2025 (another slight variant, likely preliminary data). Provides cost estimates ($60,000/case) and herd immunity thresholds (95%). Expert opinion piece with factual CDC citations.

**Multnomah County (Feb 9, 2026)**: Local health advisory noting cases in Oregon/SW Washington but no specific counts. Low information value for national forecasting.

**Agent Report**: Comprehensive compilation of CDC historical data (2010-2025) and early 2026 reports. Notes first documented 2026 count was 588 cases on Jan 30, 2026. High-quality synthesis of multiple sources with clear methodology.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Year-over-year continuation of 2025 outbreak trajectory**: 2025 had 2,276 cases total. We're at 733 cases by Feb 5 (36 days into year). This represents 32% of 2025's total in just 10% of the year.

2. **Historical high-incidence years (2014, 2019)**: 2014 had 667 cases (Disney outbreak), 2019 had 1,282 cases (NY outbreak). These represent years when large outbreaks occurred but were eventually controlled.

3. **Post-elimination era patterns (2000-2025)**: Median ~120 cases/year with periodic spikes. However, 2025 represented a regime shift with 49 outbreaks and near-loss of elimination status.

4. **Continuation of active multi-state outbreaks**: SC outbreak (933 cases state-level by Feb 10) is still growing. 662 of 733 national cases (90%) are continuations from 2025 outbreaks.

**Most suitable reference class**: The continuation of 2025's outbreak dynamics, adjusted for the specific trajectory of the SC outbreak and seasonal patterns. This is unprecedented territory - the U.S. hasn't seen sustained transmission at this scale since elimination in 2000.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: Feb 12 to Apr 24, 2026 = 71 days (approximately 2.4 months)

**Current trajectory**: 
- 733 cases as of Feb 5 (36 days into year) = 20.4 cases/day average
- If this rate continued: 733 + (71 days × 20.4) = ~2,181 cases by Apr 24

**Historical seasonal patterns**:
- Measles typically peaks in late winter/spring (March-May)
- We're entering the traditional high-transmission season
- School exposure sites facilitate spread

**Outbreak dynamics**:
- SC outbreak: 933 cases state-level by Feb 10, still growing with "hundreds infected in latest outbreak"
- 92% of cases are outbreak-associated, suggesting sustained community transmission
- Two new 2026 outbreaks (only 9 cases so far) could expand

**Comparison to 2025 trajectory**:
- If 2026 follows 2025's pattern proportionally: 2,276 cases over 365 days = 6.2 cases/day average
- Current rate (20.4/day) is 3.3× higher than 2025's average
- This suggests either: (a) front-loaded outbreak activity, or (b) acceleration beyond 2025 levels

## (d) Justification

The outside view prediction must account for several factors:

**Upward pressures:**
1. Current daily rate (20.4 cases/day) is exceptionally high
2. SC outbreak shows no signs of peaking (933 state cases, still growing)
3. Entering peak transmission season (March-May)
4. 662 cases from continuing 2025 outbreaks suggest sustained chains
5. Vaccination coverage at 92.5% (below 95% herd immunity threshold)
6. Global measles activity high, increasing import risk

**Downward pressures:**
1. Public health response intensifying (quarantines, contact tracing)
2. Outbreaks eventually burn out as susceptible populations depleted
3. Media attention may drive vaccination uptake
4. Historical pattern: even large outbreaks (2019) were contained below 1,300 annually

**Base rate scenarios:**
- **Optimistic**: Outbreak peaks soon, rate drops to 2025 average (6.2/day) → 733 + (71 × 6.2) = ~1,173 cases
- **Moderate**: Rate gradually declines from 20.4 to 10/day average → 733 + (71 × 15) = ~1,798 cases
- **Pessimistic**: Current rate continues or accelerates → 733 + (71 × 25) = ~2,508 cases

The SC outbreak alone (933 cases state-level) represents a significant portion of the national count. If it continues growing at recent rates (~15-20 cases/day state-level based on growth from late Jan to Feb 10), it could add 500-1,000 more cases by April.

Outside view calibration:

## (a) Distribution Considerations

I'm predicting a continuous count over 71 days with high current momentum but uncertain trajectory. The true distribution should reflect:
- High probability mass around continuation of current trends (1,500-2,500 range)
- Meaningful probability of control measures working (lower tail 1,000-1,500)
- Non-trivial probability of acceleration or new outbreaks (upper tail 2,500-4,000)
- Very low but non-zero probability of extreme outcomes in either direction

## (b) Anchoring to Established Patterns

Historical outbreaks show S-curved growth: rapid initial expansion, peak, then decline. The question is where we are on that curve. Given 92% outbreak-association and sustained transmission, we're likely still in expansion or early plateau phase.

2019 (1,282 total) and 2025 (2,276 total) provide bounds. Current trajectory suggests 2026 could exceed both if not controlled.

## (c) Tail Calibration

**Lower tail (10th percentile)**: Aggressive control measures work, SC outbreak peaks immediately, rate drops sharply. Historical minimum would be if rate dropped to 2020-2023 levels (~5/day) → 733 + (71 × 5) = 1,088. Set 10th at 1,100 to account for some continued growth.

**Upper tail (90th percentile)**: SC outbreak continues growing, new outbreaks emerge, seasonal peak amplifies transmission. If rate increases to 30/day → 733 + (71 × 30) = 2,863. Additional outbreaks could push higher. Set 90th at 3,200 to account for compound outbreak scenarios.

## (d) Historical Upset Rate

Post-elimination measles has shown high variance with periodic large outbreaks (2014, 2019, 2025). The current situation is unprecedented in scale for the elimination era. Risk of upsets is HIGH - either rapid control (positive upset) or acceleration beyond projections (negative upset). This warrants wide intervals.
