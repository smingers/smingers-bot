Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**CDC Primary Sources (Feb 5-6, 2026):**
- CDC Measles Cases and Outbreaks page: **733 cases as of Feb 5, 2026**. Highest quality, primary surveillance data. 92% outbreak-associated (671 cases), with 662 from 2025-origin outbreaks and 9 from new 2026 outbreaks. Reports 20 jurisdictions affected. This is the gold standard source.
- Historical CDC data: 2025 had 2,276 cases (30-year high); 2024 had 285 cases.

**State-Level Sources:**
- North Carolina DPH (Feb 10, 2026): 18 cases in NC since December 2025, with detailed weekly breakdown showing declining trend (peak 5 cases week of Jan 10, down to 1-2 cases recently).
- South Carolina outbreak data (multiple sources): **546-605 cases reported in SC alone in 2026**, part of larger outbreak starting fall 2025 with 920+ total cases. This is the epicenter.

**News Aggregation (Feb 9-12, 2026):**
- UCLA Health, USA Today, ABC News, Medical Xpress all cite the CDC's 733 figure as of Feb 5-6.
- USA Today reports 23 people hospitalized in 2026 (vs 11% hospitalization rate in 2025).
- Multiple sources confirm 20 states affected: AZ, CA, FL, GA, ID, KY, MN, NE, NC, ND, OH, OK, OR, PA, SC, SD, UT, VA, WA, WI.

**Expert Opinions (Identifiable):**
- Dr. Sanchi Malhotra (UCLA): Attributes increase to declined vaccination rates (92.5% vs 95% needed for herd immunity), global circulation, high contagiousness.
- Dr. Mehmet Oz (CMS Administrator): Urged vaccination on CNN Feb 8.
- Dr. Demetre Daskalakis (former CDC): "Our defenses are down" in communities with low vaccination.

**International Context:**
- Mexico: 9,074 confirmed cases since Jan 2025, 28 deaths as of Feb 12, 2026. Seven states are "red zones."
- PAHO issued epidemiological alert for Americas (Feb 11, 2026).
- U.S. faces April 2026 PAHO review for potential loss of elimination status if 12-month continuous transmission confirmed.

**AskNews Articles (Jan-Feb 2026):**
- Multiple sources report **over 800 cases by Feb 11, 2026** across 23 states (New Republic, U.S. News).
- Center for Outbreak Response Innovation cited "over 800 additional cases" in first 1.5 months of 2026.
- South Carolina remains epicenter with 600+ cases.
- 93% of 2026 cases are unvaccinated.

**Critical discrepancy:** CDC official count shows 733 as of Feb 5, but multiple news sources cite "over 800" by Feb 11. This suggests rapid acceleration (70+ cases in 6 days) or reporting lag.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Current baseline of 733-800+ cases by early February** (CDC primary + multiple independent confirmations). This is factual, not opinion.
2. **South Carolina outbreak continuation**: 546-605 cases in SC alone in 2026, part of ongoing outbreak. Multiple independent sources (state DPH, CDC, news). Structural factor: outbreak started Oct 2025, still active.
3. **Vaccination coverage below herd immunity threshold**: 92.5% vs 95% needed (CDC data). Multiple experts cite this. Structural factor difficult to change quickly.
4. **Geographic spread to 20-23 states**: Confirmed by CDC and multiple sources. Indicates multiple active transmission chains.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Weekly case trends**: NC data shows declining trend in one state (5 cases/week peak → 1-2 cases/week). Suggests some outbreaks may be waning.
2. **Hospitalization rate change**: 23% in 2026 vs 11% in 2025 (USA Today). Small sample, but suggests possible severity/detection changes.
3. **International pressure**: Mexico's 9,074 cases creates importation risk. PAHO alert signals regional concern.
4. **Two new 2026-origin outbreaks reported** (CDC): Only 9 cases so far, but potential for growth.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **PAHO April deadline**: Creates political/surveillance pressure but doesn't mechanistically change transmission.
2. **Expert predictions of "losing elimination status"**: Speculative, though informed.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window:** 78 days (Feb 12 → Apr 24, 2026) = approximately 11 weeks = 5-6 measles generations (12-14 day generation time).

**If halved (39 days to ~Mar 23):** Would expect ~900-1,100 cases. Most growth from SC outbreak continuation plus existing chains. Less time for new outbreaks to seed and grow.

**If doubled (156 days to ~Jul 19):** Would expect 1,800-3,000+ cases. Sufficient time for 2-3 new large outbreaks to emerge and mature, plus full spring transmission season.

**Key temporal factors:**
- SC outbreak has been active 4+ months; historical outbreaks typically peak at 2-3 months then decline over 4-6 months with intervention.
- Spring season (March-April) historically sees moderate measles transmission.
- 11 weeks allows time for 1-2 new outbreaks to seed and reach 100-300 cases if seeded early.

## (d) Justification for Adjusting Outside View

**Outside view baseline:** 10th: 800, Median: 1,100-1,150, 90th: 2,000

**Key adjustments needed:**

1. **Higher starting point than outside view assumed**: Outside view used 733 as of Feb 5, but evidence suggests 800+ by Feb 11. This 6-day acceleration (70+ cases) extrapolates to ~800 cases over 78 days if sustained, but more likely reflects reporting catch-up. **Modest upward shift (+50-100 cases across distribution).**

2. **SC outbreak trajectory**: With 546-605 cases already in 2026 and outbreak ongoing since Oct 2025, historical patterns suggest another 100-200 cases plausible before control (4-6 month outbreak duration typical). NC data shows declining trend, suggesting some outbreaks waning. **Confirms outside view SC estimate of +120 median.**

3. **Geographic spread to 20-23 states**: More widespread than typical, but most states report <20 cases. Suggests multiple small chains rather than new large outbreaks. **Confirms outside view estimate of +60 for smaller continuations.**

4. **Two new 2026 outbreaks (9 cases)**: Early stage. Could grow to 50-150 cases each by April if in undervaccinated communities. **Confirms outside view +70 median estimate.**

5. **Risk of new large outbreak**: 
   - Structural factors favor: 92.5% vaccination (vs 95% needed), 286,000 unvaccinated kindergarteners, high international circulation (Mexico 9,074 cases).
   - Structural factors against: Heightened surveillance, PAHO scrutiny, public health mobilization, media attention.
   - Historical base rate: ~20% chance of new large outbreak in any 10-week period during surge years.
   - **Maintain 20% probability of new outbreak >300 cases.**

6. **Reporting dynamics**: CDC updates weekly; final April 30 report captures cases through April 24. Minimal lag risk.

**Net adjustment:** Outside view distribution remains appropriate. The 800+ figure by Feb 11 suggests we're tracking toward the middle-to-upper range of the outside view rather than lower range. The evidence confirms rather than contradicts the outside view assumptions.

## Distribution Calibration

**Starting point:** 800-850 cases as of Feb 12 (accounting for recent acceleration).

**Scenario modeling:**

**Pessimistic (10th percentile - 850):**
- SC outbreak stops quickly (+50 cases)
- All other chains extinguish rapidly (+20 cases)
- No new outbreaks
- Total: 850 + 70 = 920
- Round to: **900**

**Lower-middle (20th percentile - 1,000):**
- SC adds 80 cases
- Other states add 40 cases
- New outbreaks add 30 cases
- Total: 850 + 150 = 1,000

**Median scenario (40th-60th percentiles - 1,100-1,250):**
- SC adds 120-150 cases
- Other states add 60-80 cases
- Two 2026 outbreaks grow to 70-100 cases
- Small probability (15%) of new outbreak starting adds expected 45 cases
- Total: 850 + 295-375 = 1,145-1,225
- 40th: **1,100**
- 60th: **1,250**

**Upper-middle (80th percentile - 1,600):**
- SC adds 200 cases
- Other states add 120 cases
- Two 2026 outbreaks reach 150 cases
- One new moderate outbreak (200 cases) seeds in March
- Total: 850 + 670 = 1,520
- Round to: **1,600**

**Pessimistic tail (90th percentile - 2,200):**
- SC adds 250 cases
- Multiple state chains persist (+150)
- One large new outbreak (500+ cases) seeds early February in undervaccinated community
- Total: 850 + 900 = 1,750-2,200
- Given 10% probability of this scenario: **2,200**

**Tail considerations:** 
- Upper bound of 10,000 is implausible in 11 weeks (would require multiple simultaneous 2019-scale outbreaks).
- Lower bound of 588 is impossible (already at 800+).
- My 90th percentile of 2,200 reflects ~3x current level, which would require one major new outbreak plus continuation of all existing chains.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** CDC-reported cumulative confirmed U.S. measles cases for 2026 as of April 24, 2026 (units: cases). ✓

2. **Outside view base rate:** 10th: 800, Median: 1,100-1,150, 90th: 2,000. My final prediction maintains this structure with minor adjustments for higher current baseline. ✓

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 1,175; mean ≈ 1,300. This aligns with "current 800-850 cases + 350-450 additional over 11 weeks" from ongoing outbreaks and moderate new seeding risk. ✓

4. **Key evidence pieces:**
   - 733-800+ cases confirmed by Feb 5-11 (CDC + multiple sources) - FACTUAL ✓
   - SC outbreak 546-605 cases, ongoing since Oct 2025 (state DPH, CDC) - FACTUAL ✓
   - 20-23 states affected, 92% outbreak-associated (CDC) - FACTUAL ✓
   - Vaccination 92.5% vs 95% needed (CDC) - FACTUAL ✓
   - Two new 2026 outbreaks, 9 cases (CDC) - FACTUAL ✓

5. **Blind-spot:** One large outbreak seeding in early February in highly undervaccinated community (e.g., religious community, detention center) that goes undetected for 2-3 weeks could generate 500-800 cases by April, pushing total to 2,000-2,500. This would push outcome UP. Probability ~10-15%.

6. **Status quo:** Current trajectory suggests steady accumulation at ~100-150 cases/month from existing outbreaks. This supports median of 1,100-1,250. Volatility is moderate (not low, not extreme).

7. **Technicalities:** All percentiles strictly increasing ✓. Units in cases ✓. Values above lower bound of 588 ✓. Values well below upper bound of 10,000 ✓.
