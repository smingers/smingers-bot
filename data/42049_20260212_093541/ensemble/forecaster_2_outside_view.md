Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

- This is a state-level count, not national
- Critical data point: SC outbreak is largest contributor to 2026 national total
- High quality official state data

**Stanford Medicine Expert (Jan 28, 2026):**
- Dr. Nadimpalli (identified expert) provides context on contagiousness and vaccination thresholds
- Factual: 95% vaccination needed for herd immunity, current rates below this
- Expert opinion valuable for understanding trajectory

**Asheville Citizen Times Opinion (Feb 11, 2026):**
- Dr. Bindu Mayi (immunology professor) cites 2,242 cases in 2025 (slight discrepancy with CDC's 2,276)
- Opinion piece but from credible expert
- Economic cost data ($60k per case) is contextual

**Agent Report:**
- Comprehensive historical data 2010-2025
- Confirms 733 cases as of Feb 5, 2026
- Notes first 2026 report was ~588 cases on Jan 30, 2026
- High quality synthesis

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Year-to-date accumulation patterns (same calendar period):**
   - 2025: Started with major outbreaks, reached 2,276 total
   - 2019: Reached 1,282 total (previous modern high)
   - Most relevant: How do cases accumulate from early February through late April?

2. **Outbreak continuation dynamics:**
   - 662 of 733 current cases are from 2025 outbreaks
   - SC outbreak (933 state cases) is still growing
   - Historical: Large outbreaks can persist 6-12 months

3. **Post-elimination era patterns (2000-2025):**
   - Median: ~120 cases/year
   - Range: 13 (2020) to 2,276 (2025)
   - Shows high variability, outbreak-driven

**Most suitable reference class:** Year-to-date accumulation during active outbreak periods, specifically 2019 and 2025, adjusted for current outbreak size and trajectory.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** Feb 12, 2026 to April 24, 2026 = 71 days (approximately 10 weeks)

**Current status (Feb 5, 2026):** 733 cases (36 days into year)

**Historical accumulation patterns:**

- **2025 trajectory:** If 2025 reached 2,276 total, and assuming relatively even distribution, that's ~190 cases/month or ~6.2 cases/day average. However, outbreaks are clustered, not uniform.

- **2019 comparison:** 1,282 cases over full year, but heavily front-loaded due to NY outbreak

- **Current rate:** 733 cases in 36 days = 20.4 cases/day average so far in 2026

**Key factors for next 71 days:**

1. **SC outbreak trajectory:** Currently 933 state cases, still active with 500+ in quarantine. If this continues at current pace, could add 300-600 more cases nationally.

2. **Seasonal patterns:** Measles typically peaks in late winter/spring (March-May), so we're entering peak transmission season.

3. **Outbreak control efforts:** Public health response may slow transmission, but 95% vaccination threshold not met in affected communities.

4. **Carryover from 2025 outbreaks:** 662 cases already from continuing outbreaks suggests sustained transmission.

## (d) Justification

**Base rate calculation:**
- Current: 733 cases (36 days)
- Remaining period: 71 days
- If current rate continues: 733 + (20.4 × 71) = 733 + 1,448 = 2,181 cases

**Adjustment factors:**

*Upward pressures:*
- SC outbreak still growing (933 state cases, likely 600+ nationally)
- Entering peak measles season (March-April)
- Multiple active outbreak sites (20 jurisdictions)
- Vaccination rates below herd immunity threshold (92.5% vs 95% needed)
- High proportion outbreak-associated (92%) suggests sustained transmission chains

*Downward pressures:*
- Public health interventions intensifying
- Media attention may increase vaccination/awareness
- Some 2025 outbreaks may burn out
- Quarantine measures in SC (500+ people)

**Realistic scenarios:**

- **Low scenario:** Aggressive control measures work, outbreaks plateau. Growth rate halves to ~10 cases/day. Total: 733 + (10 × 71) = 1,443 cases

- **Medium scenario:** Current trajectory continues with modest deceleration. ~15 cases/day average. Total: 733 + (15 × 71) = 1,798 cases

- **High scenario:** SC outbreak continues growing, additional outbreaks emerge, seasonal peak effect. ~25 cases/day. Total: 733 + (25 × 71) = 2,508 cases

- **Very high scenario:** Multiple large outbreaks, loss of elimination status. ~30+ cases/day. Total: 2,800+ cases

Outside view calibration:

The distribution should reflect:
1. **High uncertainty:** We're only 36 days into the year with major active outbreaks
2. **Right-skewed distribution:** Outbreak dynamics can produce sudden acceleration
3. **Historical precedent:** 2025 reached 2,276; 2019 reached 1,282
4. **Current momentum:** 20.4 cases/day is high and entering peak season
5. **Tail risks:** Loss of elimination status could mean 3,000+ cases

The 10th percentile should capture scenarios where control measures work exceptionally well. The 90th percentile should capture scenarios where multiple outbreaks spiral and seasonal effects compound.

Given current trajectory (733 cases in 36 days), the median should be around 1,700-2,000 cases, with substantial probability mass extending to 2,500+.
