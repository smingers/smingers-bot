Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (summary, quality, date)

1. **CDC “Measles Cases and Outbreaks” (updated Feb 6, 2026; data as of Feb 5, 2026)**  
   - **What it provides (factual):** Official national surveillance totals and outbreak association: **733 confirmed U.S. cases in 2026 as of Feb 5**, 92% outbreak-associated, and most (662) linked to outbreaks that began in 2025. Also provides final totals for 2024 (285) and 2025 (2,276) and vaccination-coverage context.  
   - **Quality:** Highest-quality source for the resolution criterion (this is the resolution source).  
   - **Usefulness:** Directly anchors that 2026 is already a very high-incidence year early on.

2. **NBC News tracker (Feb 6, 2026)**  
   - **What it provides:** Journalistic summary of CDC counts and outbreak narrative (e.g., “one of the three worst years since 2000,” “first full week: 279 new cases”).  
   - **Quality:** Medium; generally credible but secondary reporting.  
   - **Usefulness:** Helpful for *pace* language, but numbers should be treated as derivative of CDC and potentially simplified.

3. **CDC “Global Measles Outbreaks” (Feb 11, 2026)**  
   - **What it provides:** Global context (measles outbreaks in every region; large international burdens).  
   - **Quality:** High for global context; not directly quantifying U.S. trajectory to April.  
   - **Usefulness:** Supports the plausibility of continued importations and multiple seeding events.

4. **South Carolina DPH outbreak page (as of Feb 10, 2026)**  
   - **What it provides (factual):** **933 measles cases in SC outbreak** (state-level reporting) and evidence of sustained community transmission (exposure sites).  
   - **Quality:** High for that state’s reporting; may differ in definition/timing from CDC’s national confirmed count.  
   - **Usefulness:** Signals that a single large outbreak can drive national totals and may still be expanding.

5. **Stanford Medicine expert explainer (Jan 28, 2026)**  
   - **What it provides:** Expert interpretation (named infectious disease physician) on contagiousness, herd-immunity threshold, and elimination-status risk.  
   - **Quality:** Medium-high for qualitative epidemiologic plausibility; not a numeric forecast.  
   - **Usefulness:** Supports the idea that if low-coverage pockets persist, transmission can sustain.

6. **Asheville Citizen Times opinion (Feb 11, 2026)**  
   - **What it provides:** Mix of factual CDC references (2025 total) and opinionated framing (endemic risk).  
   - **Quality:** Medium; opinion piece though author is identifiable.  
   - **Usefulness:** Limited for quantification; some context on herd immunity and costs.

7. **Multnomah County local advisory (Feb 9, 2026)**  
   - **What it provides:** Local situational awareness (cases in Oregon/SW Washington; none in Multnomah specifically).  
   - **Quality:** High for local info; no national counts.  
   - **Usefulness:** Weak for national totals but consistent with multi-region activity.

8. **Agent report (compiled Feb 12, 2026)**  
   - **What it provides:** A convenient historical annual series (2010–2025) and repeats CDC’s early-2026 figure (733 as of Feb 5). Also includes media-derived statements about outbreak sizes and earliest 2026 postings.  
   - **Quality:** Mixed—annual CDC series is likely reliable; media-derived outbreak-size claims are less certain.  
   - **Usefulness:** Good for constructing a reference class (annual totals) and recognizing heavy-tail behavior (rare very large years).

### (b) Reference class analysis (candidate classes + choice)

**Candidate reference classes:**
1. **All U.S. measles annual totals post-elimination (e.g., 2010–2025).**  
   - *Pros:* Clean, consistent CDC series; shows baseline low incidence with occasional spikes.  
   - *Cons:* We need **cumulative by late April**, not year-end totals; also 2026 already appears structurally different from the typical post-2000 regime.

2. **“Spike years” / major outbreak years** (e.g., 2014, 2019, 2025).  
   - *Pros:* Better matched to a year already showing very high early counts and outbreak-dominated transmission.  
   - *Cons:* Small sample; outbreak timing differs by year.

3. **“Early-year-to-late-April growth” in spike years** (fraction of annual cases accrued by late April).  
   - *Pros:* Conceptually best for an April checkpoint.  
   - *Cons:* We don’t have an explicit CDC intra-year curve in the provided materials, so we must approximate.

**Most suitable for an outside view:** a **hybrid**: use **spike-year behavior** (heavy tail; outbreak-driven) combined with a generic **seasonality assumption** that measles often concentrates in late winter/spring, while acknowledging that a continuing 2025-origin outbreak can shift timing.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Forecast target date:** cumulative confirmed cases **as of April 24, 2026**, using the CDC update reflecting reports as of **April 30, 2026**.  
- **Time remaining from “today” (Feb 12, 2026):** about **10–11 weeks** until April 24 (and ~11 weeks to April 30 reporting cutoff).  
- **Pattern considerations:**  
  - Measles in temperate regions often has strong winter–spring activity; therefore, **a large share of annual cases can accrue by late April** in outbreak years.  
  - However, outbreak containment efforts (vaccination campaigns, exclusion/quarantine, depletion of susceptibles) can produce **rapid deceleration** after an explosive phase—introducing wide uncertainty over the next ~11 weeks.

---

### (d) Justification (outside view)

**Outside view baseline from history:**  
- Most post-2010 years are low (tens to low hundreds), but the distribution is **fat-tailed**: 667 (2014), ~1,282 (2019), and 2,276 (2025). This implies that once a major outbreak takes hold, totals can scale into the thousands.

**Applying that to an April checkpoint:**  
- In a major outbreak year, late-April cumulative totals plausibly land anywhere from “a bit above current levels” (if strong deceleration) to “several thousand” (if ongoing multi-state propagation and additional seeding events).  
- The presence of multiple jurisdictions already reporting cases and the strong outbreak-association suggests that near-term counts are mostly driven by **outbreak trajectory** (growth vs. taper), which is highly variable.

**Fermi-style growth framing (for April 24):**  
- Starting point is already in the high hundreds by early February (733 as of Feb 5 per CDC). Over ~11 weeks, incremental cases could range from:
  - **Low growth:** +200 to +500 (rapid containment)  
  - **Moderate growth:** +800 to +1,500  
  - **High growth:** +2,000 to +4,000 (continued exponential-ish spread across under-immunized pockets)  
- This yields a wide plausible range roughly **~900 to ~5,000+** by late April, with a meaningful (though not dominant) upper tail if the situation deteriorates.

Given the domain’s history of **rare but very large outliers** and the difficulty of outbreak containment once multiple communities are involved, I set a **wide 10th–90th interval** and a right-skewed distribution.

---

Outside view calibration:

- I’m targeting a distribution that reflects (1) heavy-tailed outbreak risk and (2) the fact that we are forecasting a **near-term cumulative** (late April), not a full-year total.  
- Upset/unknown-unknown rate is material: a single superspreading setting or a new low-coverage community ignition can add hundreds quickly; conversely, aggressive response can flatten incidence sharply.  
- Therefore I avoid over-tightening around a single trajectory and keep an expansive upper tail.
