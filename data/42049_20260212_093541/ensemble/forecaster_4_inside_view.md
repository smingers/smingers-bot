Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, key facts vs. opinion)

1. CDC “Measles Cases and Outbreaks” update 6 Feb 2026 (data to 5 Feb) – gold-standard surveillance; reports 733 confirmed U.S. cases in 2026 so far, 92 % outbreak-associated, 20 jurisdictions involved. Pure fact, strongest quality.

2. USA Today graphic 10 Feb 2026 – secondary report that mirrors CDC figures and supplies state-level detail (South Carolina 546 cases). Factual numbers traceable to state DoH / CDC; explanatory text partly journalistic opinion. Quality: moderate–high.

3. UCLA Health explainer 9 Feb 2026 – repeats CDC 733 figure, adds expert commentary (Dr Sanchi Malhotra) on drivers (declining coverage, importations). Facts sound; opinions from named infectious-disease specialist (reliable).

4. NC DHHS outbreak page 10 Feb 2026 – North-Carolina-only data (18 cases). Primary state source; factual.

5. U.S. News & World Report 11 Feb 2026 – pulls together multi-state counts (> 800 cases, 23 states) and quotes federal/state officials. Numbers traceable to different cut-off than CDC (later in week); still factual but mixing preliminary counts. Quality: moderate.

6. PAHO epidemiological alert 11 Feb 2026 – Regional organisation urging heightened surveillance. Factual statement of alert; no U.S. numbers. Quality: strong for policy signal.

7. Assorted Jan 2026 articles (The Hill, National Post, AP etc.) – give early-January national count of 416, context on loss-of-elimination status. Facts ultimately sourced to CDC; quality: moderate, slightly dated.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative weight)

Strong evidence  
• CDC showing 733 confirmed cases by 5 Feb (highest first-five-weeks count on record).  
• Historical pattern: large outbreak years (2014, 2019, 2025) produce heavy-tailed distributions with thousands of cases.  
• Structural driver: national kindergarten MMR coverage 92.5 % (< 95 % herd threshold) – difficult to change by April.

Moderate evidence  
• State-level reports (SC ≥ 546 cases) demonstrating sustained transmission pockets.  
• PAHO & experts warning of possible loss of elimination status ⇒ political pressure for aggressive control (may curb growth).  
• Early-2026 weekly average ≈ 147 new CDC-confirmed cases/week – shows momentum but could taper.

Weak evidence  
• Media speculation about RFK Jr. “fueling” hesitancy – anecdotal link to case numbers.  
• Unverified estimates of “under-counting” from opinion columns.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days to target: 72 days (~10.3 weeks) until 24 Apr (11 weeks to the CDC 30 Apr reporting cut-off).  
If time were halved (5 weeks): little room for large acceleration; forecast would shift downward roughly 15-20 %.  
If doubled (21 weeks): tail risk of > 8 000 cases would grow and distribution would shift upward.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view base (post-2000 spike years) produced median ≈ 2 100 cases by late April.  
Inside view updates:  
+ Strong early 2026 count (733) = already >30 % of 2025 full-year total reached in just 5 weeks.  
+ Multiple large, still-growing outbreaks (SC, UT, AZ).  
– Intensifying emergency vaccination campaigns (SC, TX border states) and heightened media attention historically slow growth within 1–2 generation times.  
Net: raise entire distribution slightly, keep heavy right tail for uncontrolled-spread scenario, but leave a sizeable probability mass for moderation.

Distribution calibration
I model four discrete scenarios:  
1) Rapid control (+880 cases) 25 %  
2) Plateau (+1 617) 35 %  
3) Continued growth (+2 420) 25 %  
4) Re-acceleration (+6 600) 15 %  

Blending these gives the following percentile curve (strictly increasing):

Percentile 10: 1 200 cases  
Percentile 20: 1 500 cases  
Percentile 40: 2 000 cases  
Percentile 60: 2 500 cases  
Percentile 80: 3 500 cases  
Percentile 90: 6 000 cases  

Checklist:
1. Target variable: CDC-reported cumulative confirmed U.S. measles cases in 2026 as of 24 Apr 2026 (integer cases).  
2. Base-rate distribution stated above.  
3. Implied median ≈ 2 500; mean ≈ 3 150 – consistent with justification and heavy-tail risk.  
4. Key evidence: a) 733 cases by 5 Feb, b) 92.5 % MMR coverage, c) SC 546-case outbreak, d) 2025 precedent of 2 276 cases, e) PAHO alert prompting control.  
5. Blind-spot: Undetected large urban outbreak seeded now that explodes in March, pushing cases > 10 000 (would raise outcome).  
6. Status quo weekly growth argument already central to scenarios.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units = cases; within open bounds.
