Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
• CDC measles page (6 Feb 2026 update).  Factual, primary surveillance data. 733 confirmed U.S. cases in 2026 so far; 92 % outbreak–associated, 662 of them spill-over from 2025 clusters. Highest-quality source; data are one week old.  
• NBC News (6 Feb 2026).  Journalistic summary of the CDC numbers plus quotes from state officials. Factual counts mirror CDC; commentary (“already one of the three worst years”) is opinion. Useful for qualitative colour, not for numbers beyond CDC.  
• CDC Global Outbreaks page (11 Feb 2026).  Gives worldwide context; confirms large international activity. Good for assessing importation risk; no new U.S. numbers.  
• SC DPH outbreak page (10 Feb 2026).  State surveillance—933 cases in one South-Carolina-centred outbreak, majority occurring in 2026. High-quality, narrowly focused. Indicates that the national CDC count of 733 as of 5 Feb almost certainly contains ≥ 600 SC cases and is therefore still rising.  
• Stanford Medicine Q&A (28 Jan 2026).  Expert infectious-disease clinician summarises 2025 CDC data and explains transmission dynamics. Opinions are expert-level; no 2026 numbers beyond CDC.  
• Asheville Citizen-Times op-ed (11 Feb 2026).  Cites CDC 2025 total, provides cost estimates. Opinion piece; factual numbers are reliable because lifted from CDC, but commentary is advocacy.  
• Multnomah County advisory (9 Feb 2026).  Local alert; confirms Pacific-Northwest seeding but gives no counts. Low numerical utility; signals geographic spread.  
• Agent report (12 Feb 2026).  Collates the same CDC figures and historical yearly totals 2010-2025. Numbers match CDC publications; date-stamped. Helpful for long-range reference class.

b) Reference-class analysis  
Options considered:  
1. Full-year U.S. measles totals 2010-2025.  
2. Only large-surge years since elimination (2014, 2019, 2025).  
3. Within-year growth curves for recent large outbreaks (data sparse).  
Because the forecast horizon is short (10 weeks) and we already sit at 733 cases, the best baseline is “large-surge years” (#2) but normalised to partial-year progress. In 2019 roughly 60 % of the 1 282 cases were reported during January–April; in 2025 ~25 % of the 2 276 total were logged by 30 Apr (back-calculating from CDC weekly tables). That yields a crude multiplier of 1.4–4.0 from early-February level to late-April level. Using the lower half of that range (1.2–2.0) seems more realistic because today we are already deep into one very large, slowly declining SC outbreak.

c) Time-frame analysis  
Days until the CDC cut-off (noon Thu 30 Apr 2026) ≈ 78; roughly 11 weekly CDC updates remain. Historically, once an outbreak is recognised, aggressive ring-vaccination and post-exposure prophylaxis damp growth within 3-6 generations (one generation ≈ 10-14 days). The SC outbreak began Oct 2025 and has slowed but not yet stopped, suggesting another 100–200 cases plausible before April. Most other 2025 clusters have burned out. The risk window for new import-seeded outbreaks exists—international incidence is high, vaccination gaps persist—but generating >500 extra US cases before late April would require at least one large, early-February import into an undervaccinated community that goes initially undetected. Historical odds of that in any random 10-week block are low but non-trivial (~15–20 % per expert commentaries and 2014/2019 precedents).

d) Justification  
Base-rate outside view: multiply the current 733 cases by the 1.4 median of the “large-surge” reference multipliers ⇒ ≈ 1 020 cases by 24 Apr.  
Inside adjustments:  
• South-Carolina continuation: +120 median (range 50–200).  
• Known smaller continuations (AZ-UT border etc.): +60 median (range 20–120).  
• Two nascent 2026 outbreaks: +70 median (range 10–200).  
• Chance of a brand-new sizeable outbreak (>300 cases): 20 % probability; expected contribution 0.2 × 400 ≈ 80.  
Summing medians → 733 + 330 ≈ 1 060. Add variance to reflect the long tail created by the “new large outbreak” scenario.

Outside view calibration:
I anchor the distribution so that:  
• 10 % chance cumulative stays ≤ 800 (SC dies out quickly, no big new events).  
• 50 % (median) ≈ 1 100–1 150.  
• 90 % chance cumulative ≤ 2 000 (would require one more 2019-scale event starting now).  
For tail behaviour I lean on the empirical fact that only one of the past 26 years exceeded 2 300 full-year cases (2025). Since we are only forecasting through April, exceeding 2 000 by that date already implies an unprecedented acceleration; I give that only 10 % weight. I distribute intermediate percentiles smoothly, keeping them strictly increasing and somewhat wider than a log-normal with σ ≈ 0.35 to respect unknown-unknowns.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 800  
Percentile 20: 900  
Percentile 40: 1 050  
Percentile 60: 1 200  
Percentile 80: 1 500  
Percentile 90: 2 000
