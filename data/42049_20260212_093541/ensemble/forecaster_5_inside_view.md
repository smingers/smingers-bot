Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. CDC Measles Cases & Outbreaks page, update dated 6 Feb 2026 – weekly, official surveillance; highest-quality factual count (733 cases YTD).  
2. ABC News (9 Feb 2026) / USA Today graphics (10 Feb) – secondary reports quoting the CDC; good but derivative.  
3. U.S. News & World Report, Medical Xpress, NC state bulletin – reliable state or national health journalism giving state-level tallies (e.g., South Carolina 546 cases, NC 18).  Moderate quality, temporally current.  
4. The Hill & National Post (23 Jan 2026) – earlier wire pieces; confirm upward trajectory and note 416 CDC-confirmed cases three weeks earlier.  Historical context only.  
5. PAHO alert report (11 Feb 2026) – authoritative multilateral source, gives qualitative risk of continued spread.  
Only numbers originating with CDC/state health departments are treated as hard data; expert opinions quoted (Drs Malhotra, Daskalakis, Chin-Hong) are weighted if they address transmission dynamics or vaccination coverage.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• CDC count of 733 on 5 Feb; prior CDC counts show steep (≈ +75 % per month) January growth.  
• State health-dept figures (SC 546 cases) independently match the national CDC figure’s composition.  
Moderate evidence  
• Expert consensus that outbreaks are continuations of 2025 chains and that vaccination coverage (92.5 %) is sub-herd-immunity.  
• 2019 & 2025 analogues: in both years, CDC total between early Feb and late Apr grew 40–85 %.  
Weak evidence  
• News speculation that U.S. will exceed 2025 totals – plausible but early; no new large outbreaks documented yet.  
• International pressure (Mexican outbreak) – importation risk acknowledged but not yet quantified for Feb-Apr window.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Forecast window: 72 days (to 24 Apr 2026).  Halving (36 days) would leave insufficient time for secondary community spread, lowering median ~10 %.  Doubling (144 days) would reopen summer-camp season and importations, raising median ~25 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
• Starting point 733 confirmed cases.  
• In closest reference years (2019, 2025) case counts by late Apr equalled 1.8× and 1.4× their early-Feb level.  Mid-point multiplier ≈ 1.6.  
• Current SC epicentre shows first signs of slowing (school closures, ring vaccination) yet still adds ~50 cases/week.  Expect gradual taper but >300 new SC cases likely by late Apr.  
• Two small brand-new 2026 outbreaks total only nine cases – suggests limited fresh seeding so far; risk remains for one further sizeable cluster, especially in low-coverage Mid-West counties.  
• Vaccination coverage continues to erode and PAHO scrutiny may provoke intensified control after March.  
Net: expect +500-900 additional confirmed cases nationwide before 24 Apr, placing the most likely cumulative total around 1 300–1 600, but retain a fat right tail for a runaway second outbreak (5-10 % chance ≥3 000).

Distribution calibration
The inside-view distribution is centred slightly above the outside-view mode and widened for tail risk.

Percentile 10  ≈ 900 (SC outbreak contained quickly, few new clusters)  
Percentile 20  ≈ 1 050 (growth only +40 %)  
Percentile 40  ≈ 1 300 (reference-class midpoint)  
Percentile 60  ≈ 1 600 (growth +120 %)  
Percentile 80  ≈ 2 200 (one new 500-case outbreak plus continuation)  
Percentile 90  ≈ 3 000 (multiple failures of containment, ≥2 parallel outbreaks)

Checklist:
1. Target variable: CDC-reported cumulative U.S. measles cases in 2026 as of 24 Apr 2026, integer count.  
2. Outside-view base: median ~1 350; tails 900–3 000.  
3. Implied median ≈ 1 450; mean ≈ 1 650; matches justification of +50-85 % growth.  
4. Key evidence: a) CDC 733 cases 5 Feb; b) SC 546 state data; c) 2019/2025 growth patterns; d) vaccination coverage 92.5 %; e) only two new 2026 outbreaks so far.  
5. Blind-spot: explosive urban outbreak seeded by Spring-Break traveller adds >1 500 cases in March (would push outcome far right).  
6. Status-quo: continuation of existing chains already implies further growth; no nudge to a flat scenario warranted.  
7. Percentiles monotone, units = cases, within open bounds.
