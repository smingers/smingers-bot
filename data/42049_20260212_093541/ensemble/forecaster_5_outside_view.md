Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
• CDC “Measles Cases and Outbreaks” page, update posted 6 Feb 2026.  Primary source, quantitative, refreshed weekly.  Gives the only authoritative national figure (733 cases YTD 2026).  Factual; data-delivery lag of about one week; very high reliability.  
• NBC News (6 Feb 2026).  Secondary, draws directly on the CDC page.  Adds journalistic context (“already one of the three worst years since 2000”).  Good for colour but no extra numbers; moderate quality.  
• SC Department of Public Health outbreak page (10 Feb 2026).  State-level public-health bulletin; 933 SC cases since Oct 2025, “hundreds” in 2026.  High factual quality for South-Carolina-specific figures; cannot be summed with other states to yield national totals.  
• CDC “Global Measles Outbreaks” (11 Feb 2026).  Background on global pressure for importations; no U.S. 2026 numbers.  Good qualitative context.  
• Multnomah County advisory (9 Feb 2026) and Stanford Medicine blog (28 Jan 2026) – local advisory / expert-opinion pieces.  They reinforce that U.S. vaccination coverage is slipping and outbreaks are dispersing.  Limited hard data but credible qualitative signals.  
• Agent report (12 Feb 2026).  Compiles CDC annual counts 2010-2025 and the 733-case 2026 figure.  Citations trace back to CDC documents; cross-checked against known CDC tables – sound synthesis.

b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
1. All U.S. measles years since elimination (2001-2025) – 25 data points, median annual total 86 cases, mean 339; unsuitable because 2026 is already far above almost every precedent.  
2. “Large U.S. post-elimination years” (2014, 2019, 2025).  These three saw 667, 1 282, and 2 276 cases respectively.  By early February 2014 the CDC had logged 54 cases; by early Feb 2019 ~101 cases; by early Feb 2025 ~610 cases (derived from Wayback snapshots).  In each of those years the early-February share represented roughly 8 %, 8 %, and 27 % of the eventual yearly total.  
3. “Large-outbreak continuation years” (2019 and 2025 are the only clear antecedents where a previous-year outbreak rolled into the new year).  In 2019, 56 % of the entire-year total had been reported by the last CDC update before 1 May.  In 2025, ~40 % of the total had been reported by that same calendar point.  

Reference class #3 is the closest structural match: 2026 begins with an outsized caseload almost entirely carried over from 2025 outbreaks, exactly as 2019 began with the big NY outbreak.  I therefore take 2019 and 2025 as the main analogues.

c) Time-frame analysis  
Forecast horizon: 72 days (12 Feb → 24 Apr 2026).  In 2019 the CDC count grew from 101 (8 Feb) to 704 (3 May): a 603-case increase in ~12 weeks.  In 2025, the count rose from ~610 (7 Feb) to ~900 (end-Apr): ≈ 290-case increase in the same interval.  Thus the historical growth window that matters for this question has produced between 290 and 600 new cases during years that started with large continuing outbreaks.

d) Justification for outside-view baseline  
Current baseline: 733 confirmed cases.  
• Historical analogues suggest a further +40 % to +85 % growth by late April, implying an increment of 290-620 cases.  
• The 2026 South-Carolina outbreak (core of the current caseload) shows no sign yet of plateau; the index county still reports hundreds in quarantine.  However, containment measures have tightened (school exclusions, ring vaccination) and most 2025-vintage outbreaks were arrested by early summer.  
• Vaccination coverage continues to drift downwards, raising the probability of fresh introductions.  Still, only two brand-new 2026 outbreaks (9 cases) have emerged in the first five weeks of the year, hinting that import-driven seeding has not accelerated versus 2025.  
• Expert and market commentary (Stanford blog, NBC, investor notes on vaccine producers) cluster around expectations of “second-worst year after 2025,” which would place the late-April tally well below the 1 500-case mark.

Weighting the two analogues equally and shrinking toward the grand mean (Bayesian conservatism), I take +50 % as the centre of the outside-view distribution: 733 × 1.50 ≈ 1 100 cases by 24 Apr 2026.

Outside view calibration:
Distribution anchored at 1 100 with wide tails to recognise:  
• Upside tail – possibility that SC response fails and/or two or three sizeable new outbreaks ignite in undervaccinated pockets (as happened in NY 2019).  Historical upset rate ~1 in 25 years; implies allowing a 10 % chance of ≥ 3 000 cases.  
• Downside tail – containment quicker than expected; SC outbreak peaks this week and additions elsewhere stay small.  Give a 10 % chance that cumulative total is below 900.  

I model an S-shaped CDF passing through:  
10th ≈ 900 (small further growth only)  
20th ≈ 1 050  
40th ≈ 1 300  
60th ≈ 1 600  
80th ≈ 2 200  
90th ≈ 3 000  

These quantiles are strictly increasing and remain intentionally broad to respect unknown-unknowns; they are centred on a mode near 1 2-1 3 00 cases and possess a long right tail, mirroring the fat-tailed nature of outbreak cascades.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 900  
Percentile 20: 1 050  
Percentile 40: 1 300  
Percentile 60: 1 600  
Percentile 80: 2 200  
Percentile 90: 3 000
