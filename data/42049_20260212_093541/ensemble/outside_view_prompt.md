# Summary of "Global Measles Outbreaks" (CDC, February 11, 2026)

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Global measles burden (2023)**: An estimated 10.3 million people were infected with measles globally in 2023.

2. **Current outbreak status**: As of February 2026, measles outbreaks are occurring in every region of the world.

3. **U.S. measles elimination status**: Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, but cases and outbreaks continue to occur due to unvaccinated international travelers.

4. **Historical U.S. outbreak reference**: In 2019, the U.S. nearly lost its elimination status with almost 1,300 measles cases from a large outbreak in New York and cases in 30 additional states.

5. **Recent trend**: After a decrease in global measles incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic, measles activity globally and in the United States continues to rise.

6. **Top 10 countries with measles outbreaks (July-December 2025)**:
   - Yemen: 11,288 cases
   - Indonesia: 10,744 cases
   - India: 9,666 cases
   - Pakistan: 7,361 cases
   - Angola: 4,843 cases
   - Lao People's Democratic Republic: 3,167 cases
   - Mexico: 2,846 cases
   - Nigeria: 2,755 cases
   - Afghanistan: 2,668 cases
   - Mongolia: 2,551 cases

## Key Context:

- The article emphasizes that measles is one of the most contagious human diseases and can easily cross borders.
- Large U.S. outbreaks are possible when travel-related measles cases reach at-risk U.S. populations with low immunization rates.
- Data source: Provisional monthly surveillance data reported to WHO (Geneva) as of January 2026.

**Note**: This article does not provide specific U.S. measles case numbers for 2026.

## Summary of Article: "2025 Measles Outbreak" from Dph.sc

### Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Outbreak Confirmation**: South Carolina Department of Public Health (DPH) confirmed a measles outbreak in Upstate regions on October 2, 2025.

2. **Case Count**: As of February 10, 2026, DPH is reporting **933 cases of measles** centered around Spartanburg County.

3. **Case Characteristics**: The majority of cases are close contacts of known cases, though the number of public exposure sites indicates community circulation of measles.

4. **Geographic Focus**: The outbreak is centered in Spartanburg County, with some exposure sites also in Sumter County, South Carolina.

### Measles Transmission Information:

- A person is contagious four days before and after a rash begins
- The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves
- The measles vaccine (MMR and MMRV) is recommended as the best protection

### Update Frequency:

DPH posts measles updates twice weekly (Tuesdays and Fridays at 1 p.m.), though this frequency may change based on disease activity.

### Public Exposure Locations:

Eight specific public exposure locations are listed with dates ranging from January 23-30, 2026, including retail stores, restaurants, and government offices in Spartanburg and Sumter counties.

# Summary of Article: "Measles in America: Five things to know from a Stanford Medicine expert"

**Date:** January 28, 2026

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **2025 U.S. Measles Cases:** The U.S. had **2,255 confirmed cases of measles in 2025**, nearly eight times as many as in 2024.

2. **Outbreak Data:** Over the last year (presumably 2025), the country had **49 outbreaks spanning nearly every state**.

3. **Elimination Status:** The United States is likely to lose its status as a country that has eliminated measles. Loss of this designation means there has been ongoing domestic spread that has failed to be stopped over the course of a year.

## Expert Opinion (Named Source):

**Dr. Sruti Nadimpalli, MD MPH** (Clinical Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Stanford Medicine, specialist in pediatric infectious disease) provides the following insights:

- **Contagiousness:** Among people without immunity, 90% of those exposed to measles will get sick (compared to 4-12% for influenza among unvaccinated people).

- **Vaccination Requirements:** To stop the spread, 95% of the population needs the two-dose vaccine, but many U.S. communities now have lower rates of vaccine coverage.

- **Transmission:** The virus spreads through the air and viral particles can remain airborne in a room for several hours after an infected person has left. Infected people are contagious for several days before showing symptoms.

- **Vaccine Effectiveness:** The measles vaccine is described as "very safe and effective, the best protection we have against measles."

- **Treatment Limitations:** There is no specific treatment for measles (only supportive care). Unlike chickenpox or COVID-19, no effective antivirals exist for measles.

## Data Sources Referenced:

- The CDC publishes weekly updates on measles numbers
- The California Department of Public Health tracks activity across the state
- Federal, state, and local departments of public health publish data showing where measles is spreading

## Summary of Article from The Asheville Citizen Times

### Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Historical Context**: Measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, with cases stemming from imported sources.

2. **2025 Measles Cases**: According to CDC data, the U.S. reported **2,242 measles cases in 2025** - the highest annual count since 1992.

3. **Historical Range**: Reported U.S. measles cases have ranged from dozens in some years to the 2025 peak.

4. **Vaccine Effectiveness**: Two doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are **97% effective** at preventing measles.

5. **Economic Cost**: In 2025, one measles case cost roughly **$60,000** in direct medical care, contact investigations, and lost productivity.

6. **Herd Immunity Threshold**: A **95% vaccination rate** in the community generates herd immunity that prevents sustained virus transmission.

### Key Definitions and Context:

- **Measles Elimination Status**: Means the virus has not circulated continuously for 12 months and outbreaks originate from imported cases.

- **Risk of Losing Elimination Status**: Would signal a return to endemic status with continuous circulation within the U.S., increasing risk for vulnerable populations (newborns, immunocompromised individuals).

### Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) Information:

- IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) effective if administered within 6 days of exposure
- MMR vaccine can be given within 3 days of exposure (for eligible individuals)
- Quarantine periods: 21-28 days depending on vaccination/treatment status

### Source Attribution:

- Article is an opinion piece by **Dr. Bindu Mayi**, identified as a professor of immunology and microbiology and public health professional with prior CDC and U.S. Army experience
- CDC data is referenced for case counts
- Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (WHO) review cited (January 1999 to August 2025)

</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide CDC-reported U.S. measles case counts by year 2010-2025 and any reported 2026 cases or outbreaks; include dates of first 2026 reports and sizes
Below is a consolidated picture of U.S. measles activity as reported by CDC, covering the historical annual case counts (2010-2025) and the situation early in 2026.  All numbers refer to laboratory-confirmed cases that state and local jurisdictions formally notified to CDC.

1.  Annual CDC-reported U.S. measles case counts, 2010-2025  

(The counts through 2024 are taken from CDC’s “Yearly Measles Cases, 2010-2024” table, reproduced in multiple CDC webpages and data downloads; 2025 comes from the current CDC Measles Cases and Outbreaks page.  The same values are also carried in the OWID data file that cites CDC as its sole source [Our World in Data, archived 12 Feb 2026].)

• 2010 – 63  
• 2011 – 220  
• 2012 – 55  
• 2013 – 187  
• 2014 – 667  
• 2015 – 188  
• 2016 – 86  
• 2017 – 120  
• 2018 – 375  
• 2019 – 1 282  (CDC MMWR early-release summary, 3 May 2019)  
• 2020 – 13  
• 2021 – 49  
• 2022 – 121  
• 2023 – 59  
• 2024 – 285 (final figure on CDC page, updated 31 Dec 2024)  
• 2025 – 2 276 (final figure on CDC page, updated 30 Jan 2026)  (CDC Measles Cases & Outbreaks, accessed 6 Feb 2026)

These figures show the long-term low incidence after elimination (declared in 2000), the 2014 Disney-related spike, the record 1 282 cases in 2019, the collapse in 2020-2021 during the COVID-19 era, the gradual rebound in 2022-2024, and then the very large surge to 2 276 cases in 2025.

2.  2026 CDC-reported cases to date (latest update 5 Feb 2026)

• Total confirmed cases in 2026: 733  
• States/ jurisdictions reporting cases: 20 (list in CDC update)  
• Cases among international visitors: 6  
• Outbreaks: 2 new outbreaks started in 2026; in total, 92 % (671/733) of cases are outbreak-associated – 9 from the two new 2026 outbreaks and 662 that continue from outbreaks that started in 2025 (CDC Measles Cases & Outbreaks, update posted 6 Feb 2026).

3.  Timing of first CDC 2026 reports

The first publicly documented CDC figure for 2026 that we could locate appears in media coverage citing the agency’s 30 January 2026 web update, which listed 588 confirmed cases (Contagion Live, 12 Feb 2026; UPI, 7 Feb 2026).  Earlier CDC web snapshots from the first half of January were not retrieved in our search, so 30 January 2026 is, for now, the earliest definite date on which CDC posted a 2026 cumulative count.

4.  Size of the principal outbreaks still active in 2026

Because 662 of the 733 cases in 2026 are continuations of 2025 outbreaks, the outbreak picture is dominated by clusters that began last year:

• South Carolina outbreak – 920 total cases recorded since onset in Oct 2025, including “more than 600” of the 2026 U.S. total by late January 2026 (CNN, 27 Jan 2026; UPI, 7 Feb 2026).  This is now the largest U.S. outbreak since measles elimination.

• Multistate New Mexico–Oklahoma–Texas outbreak of 2025 – peaked at 762 cases before declared over in Aug 2025 (CNN report, background derived from CDC MMWR 24 Apr 2025).

• Arizona–Utah border outbreak – still growing in early 2026, exact total not given by CDC, but identified by CNN as a “large outbreak” contributing to 2026 numbers (CNN, 27 Jan 2026).  

The two new 2026 outbreaks together account for only 9 cases so far (CDC update 6 Feb 2026), so essentially all of the 2026 caseload through 5 Feb is spill-over from 2025 clusters, with the South Carolina event providing the majority.

5.  Summary table: CDC measles counts requested

Year | Cases  
2010 63  
2011 220  
2012 55  
2013 187  
2014 667  
2015 188  
2016 86  
2017 120  
2018 375  
2019 1 282  
2020 13  
2021 49  
2022 121  
2023 59  
2024 285  
2025 2 276  
2026 733 (as of 5 Feb 2026)

6.  Information gaps identified

• Exact date of CDC’s first 2026 posting and the precise figure on that date (the earliest secure reference we found is 30 Jan 2026 with 588 cases).  A Wayback Machine crawl of the CDC page for early January would pin this down.

• Granular size of each ongoing multi-state outbreak (CDC currently rolls them into one ‘continued’ total).  Jurisdiction-level press releases or CDC’s internal epi-curve PDF (often linked later in the season) could provide this.

• Official CDC year-final 2026 tally will not be known until the update covering data through Thursday 30 April 2026, the reference point for the forecasting question.

If finer detail on early-2026 posting dates or jurisdiction-specific outbreak totals is required, additional narrow searches (e.g., “site:web.archive.org measles cases and outbreaks January 2026” or “CDC measles epi curve pdf February 2026”) would be appropriate.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
