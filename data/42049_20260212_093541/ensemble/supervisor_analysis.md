Disagreement Analysis:

**Disagreement 1: Current case count and recent growth rate (as of mid-February 2026)**
The forecasters all anchor on the CDC's 733 cases as of Feb 5, but they diverge significantly on what has happened in the ~9 days since then. Forecaster 2 estimates "800+" by Feb 11, while forecasters 1 and 4 seem to assume a higher current trajectory (implying ~850-900+ by mid-Feb). This matters because the starting point for the 10-week projection window significantly shifts the entire distribution. Forecaster 2's median (~1,175) vs. forecaster 4's median (~2,500) is partly driven by different assumptions about the current weekly accrual rate.

**Disagreement 2: Expected daily/weekly case accrual rate going forward**
This is the largest source of disagreement. Forecasters 2 and 5 assume the rate will decelerate significantly (to ~5-12 cases/day on average), yielding medians of ~1,175 and ~1,450 respectively. Forecasters 1, 3, and 4 assume the rate stays closer to 15-20+ cases/day, yielding medians of ~2,000-2,500. The key factual question is whether the South Carolina outbreak is decelerating, plateauing, or still accelerating, and whether new outbreaks have seeded in other states.

**Disagreement 3: Right tail risk (probability of explosive new outbreaks)**
Forecaster 4 has a very fat right tail (P90 = 6,000), while forecasters 1, 3, and 5 cap their P90 at 3,000-3,800, and forecaster 2 at 2,200. This reflects different assessments of the probability that one or more large new outbreaks ignite in under-vaccinated communities during the spring travel season. Forecaster 4 assigns ~15% probability to a "re-acceleration" scenario adding 6,600+ cases.

Root Causes:

1. **Current case count**: Different factual beliefs — verifiable by checking the most recent CDC update or state-level data. The forecasters are working with data that's ~9 days old and extrapolating differently.

2. **Daily accrual rate trajectory**: Mix of different factual beliefs (what is the current SC outbreak trajectory? Are new outbreaks emerging?) and different weighting of evidence (how much weight to give containment efforts vs. structural vulnerability from low vaccination). The factual component — current outbreak status in SC, UT, AZ, and any new outbreaks — is verifiable.

3. **Right tail risk**: Primarily different subjective weighting/judgment about how likely explosive new outbreaks are. Partially factual — depends on current importation pressure, vaccination coverage trends, and whether new clusters have been detected.
