Resolution of Disagreements:

**Disagreement 1 (Current case count):** RESOLVED. The research clearly shows that as of February 13, 2026, the CDC reports 910 cumulative U.S. measles cases, and South Carolina alone has reached 950 cases (note: SC state count includes cases not yet confirmed/reported to CDC). This is significantly higher than the 733 cases as of Feb 5. The rate from Feb 5 to Feb 13 was approximately (910-733)/8 = 22.1 cases/day nationally reported to CDC. This supports the higher-trajectory forecasters (1, 3, 4) over the lower ones (2, 5).

**Disagreement 2 (Daily accrual rate):** PARTIALLY RESOLVED. The ~22 cases/day rate from Feb 5-13 confirms the outbreak is NOT decelerating yet. South Carolina went from ~605 to 950 cases in roughly 8-10 days (~35-43 new SC cases/day). Additionally, a NEW significant outbreak at Ave Maria University in Florida has grown to 54 cases, and outbreaks have been reported at multiple other universities (Clemson, Anderson, UW-Madison, UF). This is critical new information — the outbreak is spreading to new institutional settings (colleges), which was the "new large outbreak" scenario. This supports the higher forecasters and undermines forecaster 2's and 5's assumption of rapid deceleration.

**Disagreement 3 (Right tail risk):** PARTIALLY RESOLVED. The emergence of multiple university outbreaks increases the probability of the higher scenarios. College campuses with exemption-claiming students represent exactly the kind of under-vaccinated communities that can sustain large outbreaks. However, the university outbreaks may also be more containable (semester ends, students can be isolated). The evidence moderately supports a fatter right tail than forecasters 2 and 5 assumed.

Updated Analysis:

Key updated facts:
- 910 CDC-confirmed cases as of ~Feb 13 (just 6 weeks into 2026)
- SC outbreak at 950 cases and still growing (~13+ new cases/day in SC alone)
- Ave Maria University outbreak: 54 cases (new, significant)
- Multiple other university outbreaks emerging
- Current national rate: ~22 cases/day

From Feb 13 to Apr 24 is approximately 70 days. At various daily rates:
- 15/day (significant deceleration): 910 + 1,050 = 1,960
- 20/day (slight deceleration): 910 + 1,400 = 2,310
- 25/day (current rate maintained): 910 + 1,750 = 2,660
- 35/day (acceleration from new outbreaks): 910 + 2,450 = 3,360

Given that the SC outbreak is still growing rapidly, new university outbreaks are emerging, and spring travel season hasn't even begun, I expect the rate to remain elevated. Some deceleration is likely as SC exhausts susceptibles and vaccination campaigns ramp up, but the university outbreaks represent fresh fuel. A median around 2,200-2,400 seems well-supported.

Forecaster 2 and 5 are clearly too low given the updated data. Forecaster 4's median of 2,500 may be slightly high but is within reason. Forecaster 1 and 3 are well-calibrated. I'll center my distribution between forecasters 1/3 and 4, with a moderately fat right tail reflecting the university outbreak risk.
