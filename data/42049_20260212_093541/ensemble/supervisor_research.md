Here is a summary of the key information from the article:

The article reports that measles cases in the U.S. have officially surpassed 900 as of February 13, 2026, with the CDC confirming infections in at least 24 states. The largest outbreak is in South Carolina, with 616 cases currently. Most of the cases are in unvaccinated or under-vaccinated people, particularly children and adolescents. 

The article notes that measles was officially eliminated from the U.S. in 2000, but if widespread transmission continues for 12 months, the U.S. may lose its measles elimination status. Public health leaders are strongly urging vaccination with the MMR vaccine to reduce spread, protect vulnerable populations, and curb outbreaks. Most people vaccinated with MMR and MMRV will be protected for life.

The key symptoms of measles include high fever, cough, runny nose, red watery eyes, and tiny white spots that may appear inside the mouth 2-3 days after symptoms begin.

Summary of the article:

The article describes a measles outbreak that occurred in Armenia from February to July 2023. The key points are:

1. Facts and statistics:
   - A total of 287 confirmed measles cases were reported during the outbreak.
   - 130 (45%) of the cases were in children under 5 years old.
   - 215 (75%) of the cases were in unvaccinated individuals.
   - 70% of the 183 cases with known exposure locations were infected in healthcare facilities.
   - 15 healthcare workers were infected, and only 1 had received a single dose of a measles-containing vaccine.

Query: What is the most recent CDC-reported cumulative number of confirmed U.S. measles cases for 2026, and what is the current weekly rate of new case additions? Also, what is the current status of the South Carolina measles outbreak — is it growing, plateauing, or declining? Are there any new large outbreaks reported in other states as of February 2026?
Based on the comprehensive search results, here's a detailed analysis of the current U.S. measles situation in 2026:

Cumulative Case Numbers and Outbreak Status:
As of February 2026, the United States is experiencing a significant measles outbreak that threatens its elimination status. According to the CDC and multiple sources:

1. Cumulative Cases in 2026:
- By early 2026, over 900 measles cases have already been reported
- This makes 2026 one of the three worst years for measles infections since 2000
- In the first full week of 2026, 279 new cases were reported

2. 2025 Context:
- 2025 was the worst year for measles in over three decades
- 2,144 confirmed cases were reported across 45 states
- 49 outbreaks occurred (compared to 16 in 2024)
- 88% of cases (1,884 of 2,144) were outbreak-associated
- Three deaths were confirmed, including two unvaccinated children

Current Outbreak Dynamics:
1. South Carolina Outbreak:
- Currently the disease epicenter
- Over 500 people in quarantine
- Hundreds of infections reported
- Represents 85% of the 171 cases reported to CDC in early 2026

2. Geographic Spread:
- Active outbreaks along the Utah-Arizona border
- Continued transmission in multiple states
- Hot spots identified in West Texas, southern New Mexico, parts of Mississippi, and the rural Southeast

Vaccination and Risk Factors:
1. Vaccination Rates:
- Overall MMR vaccine uptake estimated at 64%
- National vaccination coverage around 92.5% (down from 95.2% in 2019)
- Nearly 300,000 kindergarteners lack protection
- 93% of 2025 infections were in unvaccinated (93%) or under-vaccinated (3%) individuals

Elimination Status:
- The U.S. is at risk of losing its measles elimination status
- Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) will review the status in an April 13 meeting
- Continuous transmission for 12 months could result in losing elimination status
- Canada already lost its elimination status in November 2025

Key Observations:
- Measles remains highly contagious, with up to 9 out of 10 unvaccinated people contracting the virus upon exposure
- Importation from international travelers continues to be a significant risk factor
- Pockets of low vaccination rates create vulnerable communities

Implications:
- Increased public health resource strain
- Higher risk for vulnerable populations
- Potential long-term health complications from measles infections
- Estimated cost of nearly $60,000 per measles case from a public health perspective

Recommendations:
- Boost vaccination campaigns
- Target communities with low immunization rates
- Improve public education about vaccine safety
- Enhance surveillance and outbreak response mechanisms

While the exact cumulative number for April 24, 2026, cannot be definitively predicted from these sources, the trend suggests a continued high number of cases, potentially exceeding 2,000 by that date.

Limitations:
- Data represents reported cases
- Potential underreporting in some communities
- Rapidly evolving situation

This analysis provides a comprehensive overview of the current U.S. measles situation based on the most recent available information from multiple authoritative sources.</Agent_report>

<Summary source="https://www.nytimes.com/2026/02/13/well/measles-florida-ave-maria-university.html">
Summary of the article:

The article discusses a measles outbreak at Ave Maria University in Florida, where more than 40 people have fallen ill. This outbreak is the largest on a college campus in recent history and has raised concerns among university leaders and public health experts that measles may present a growing threat to college students who are not vaccinated.

The article notes that measles has already disrupted several other college campuses across the country this year, with outbreaks reported at Clemson University, Anderson University, the University of Wisconsin-Madison, and the University of Florida. Most colleges require students to provide proof of vaccination against measles, but many allow students to claim religious or personal exemptions. There is no national data on vaccination rates among college students, but universities have noticed an uptick in personal exemptions in recent years.

The article states that before the measles vaccine was introduced in the 1960s, getting sick in adulthood was rare, as nearly all children got measles before they turned 15. However, the situation has changed, and colleges are now preparing for the possibility of measles outbreaks on their campuses, something that would have been considered very unlikely just a few years ago.
