Analysis:
To project the CDC-reported cumulative measles total by 24 Apr 2026 I first need the current 2026 year-to-date count and details about any ongoing outbreaks. Relevant information will be on the CDC measles “Cases and Outbreaks” page, state health‐department alerts, and recent news stories describing January–February 2026 clusters, importations, or multi-state transmission. I should look for: 1) the latest CDC update (usually weekly), 2) reports of sizeable outbreaks in schools, airports, or communities with low MMR coverage, 3) any changes in vaccination policy or travel advisories that could alter case trajectories. These items will give an inside-view baseline and indicate the growth rate in early 2026.
