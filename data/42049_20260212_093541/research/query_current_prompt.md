IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-12. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-12 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

The lower bound is 588 and the upper bound is 10000.
Both bounds are OPEN: outcomes can fall below the lower bound or above the upper bound. Your percentile estimates may extend beyond this range if well-supported by evidence.
