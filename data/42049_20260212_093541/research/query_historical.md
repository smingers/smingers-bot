Analysis:
To build an outside-view baseline I need:  
• The CDC’s year-to-date measles case counts for 2024 and 2025 (to gauge the current upward trend).  
• Historical annual totals, especially the outbreak years 2014, 2019, and the low-incidence years 2020-2023, to understand typical ranges and fat-tail risk.  
• The pace of case accumulation during the first four months of each year, because the question resolves on 24 Apr 2026.  
• News coverage identifying any 2026 outbreaks already reported (location, size, vaccination gaps) to update the prior.
