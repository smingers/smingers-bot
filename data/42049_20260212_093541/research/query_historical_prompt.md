You are currently doing research for historical information on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
What will be the CDC-reported cumulative number of confirmed U.S. measles cases in 2026, as of April 24, 2026?

Question background:
A point estimate of cumulative measles cases is more informative than coarse bins for planning (e.g., hospital preparedness, vaccine procurement, and risk assessment).

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves as the number of CDC-reported cumulative number of confirmed U.S. measles cases in 2026, as of April 24, 2026. It resolves using the CDC “Measles Cases and Outbreaks” page at [https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html](https://www.cdc.gov/measles/data-research/index.html). Record the cumulative number of confirmed U.S. measles cases for 2026 shown on the CDC page for the final update reflecting reports as of Thursday, April 30, 2026. The resolved value is the integer number of cases (units: cases).

Additional fine-print:


Units for answer: Measle cases

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-12. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-12 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

The lower bound is 588 and the upper bound is 10000.
Both bounds are OPEN: outcomes can fall below the lower bound or above the upper bound. Your percentile estimates may extend beyond this range if well-supported by evidence.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic or financial data, add a FRED query. Use a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate") or a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE"). Returns historical data with computed statistics.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one Agent query.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant historical context needed to generate an outside view.}

Search queries:
1. your query here (Google)
2. your query here (Google News)
3. your query here (Agent)
4. economic indicator query (FRED) -- only if question involves economic/financial data
