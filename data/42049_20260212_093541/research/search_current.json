The national measles strategy has been effective, with 9,074 confirmed cases between 2025 and 2026\u2014equating to a rate of 6.7 cases per 100,000 people in a population of 133 million. The majority of cases\u201490%\u2014occurred in unvaccinated individuals, underscoring the critical role of immunization. The first outbreak began in Chihuahua in February 2025, accounting for 49% of national cases, with a peak of 500 infections in a single day and over 4,000 cumulative cases. A campaign administering 1.8 million vaccines successfully contained the outbreak, leaving only isolated cases. Twenty-four of Mexico\u2019s 32 federal entities have fewer than 100 cumulative cases, indicating localized outbreaks. Kershenobich emphasized that measles is highly contagious\u2014each infected person can transmit the virus to up to 18 others\u2014and the virus can remain active in the environment for up to two hours. He warned that without widespread vaccination, millions could be infected.

Here Are the States With Current Outbreaks.**\nThe United States is experiencing a significant resurgence of measles, with over 800 confirmed cases across 23 states by February 11, 2026\u2014far surpassing the 120 cases reported at the same time in 2025, which led to a total of over 2,200 cases for the year, the highest since 1991. The largest outbreak is in South Carolina, accounting for more than 600 cases, while ongoing outbreaks in Utah (77 cases) and Arizona (43 cases) also contribute significantly. Other affected states include Washington (19), Florida (18), North Carolina (17), California (17), and several with 10 or fewer cases: Idaho, South Dakota, Pennsylvania, Oregon, Kentucky, Virginia, Ohio, Texas, and Wisconsin. The outbreaks threaten the country\u2019s measles elimination status. Declining vaccination rates, particularly a drop in MMR vaccine coverage from 95.2% in 2019\u20132020 to 92.5% in 2024\u20132025, are the primary drivers. This decline is linked to increased vaccination exemptions and mixed messaging from Health and Human Services Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who emphasizes personal choice over public health mandates. In contrast, Dr. Mehmet Oz, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services, urged Americans to get vaccinated, stating on CNN\u2019s 'State of the Union': 'We have a solution for our problem... measles is one you should get your vaccine for.' The CDC confirms the MMR vaccine is highly effective and long-lasting. About 85% of cases in 2026 have occurred in individuals aged 19 and younger, most unvaccinated. Measles is extremely contagious: if one person has it, up to 90% of unvaccinated people nearby will become infected.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2026 11:21 AM\nSource:[U.S. News & World Report](https://www.usnews.com/news/best-states/articles/2026-02-11/see-the-states-reporting-measles-cases-in-2026)\n\n**Northern California reports first measles outbreak since 2020. What to know**\nNorthern California reported its first confirmed measles outbreak since 2020, with 17 cases identified as of February 10, 2026, according to the California Department of Public Health. This marks a rise from 15 cases in 2024 and four in 2023. Nationally, the U.S. has confirmed 733 measles cases in 2026, with 93% of infected individuals unvaccinated. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reports that measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, meaning sustained transmission had ceased for over a year. However, rising global cases, declining vaccination rates, public health funding cuts, and misinformation are contributing to a resurgence. Dr. Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at UCSF, warns that the U.S. may lose its elimination status by the end of 2025, predicting more cases, hospitalizations, and deaths if current trends continue. California\u2019s strict vaccine requirements\u2014enforced after a 2014 Disneyland-linked outbreak\u2014have helped maintain high immunization rates (96.2% of kindergarten students vaccinated), above the 95% threshold needed to prevent transmission. Nevertheless, Chin-Hong cautions against complacency as rates have gradually declined. Measles is highly contagious, spreading via airborne particles for up to two hours, and infects 90% of unvaccinated individuals exposed. Symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, mouth spots, and a red rash. Complications range from ear infections and diarrhea to pneumonia, encephalitis, blindness, and death. The CDC recommends two doses of the MMR vaccine\u2014first between 12\u201315 months and second at 4\u20136 years\u2014for 97% effectiveness. The vaccine is described as 'one of the best vaccines we have ever had' by Chin-Hong.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2026 02:14 AM\nSource:[ArcaMax](https://www.arcamax.com/healthandspirit/health/healthtips/s-4008381)\n\n**Measles cases rising in your state? We break down the data.**\nMeasles cases are rising across the United States, with at least six confirmed cases reported in Virginia in 2026. The outbreak, which began in South Carolina last fall, has resulted in 920 infections as of February 5, 2026, including 546 cases in 2026 alone, making it the largest measles outbreak in the state since records began. Nationally, 20 states have reported cases: Arizona, California, Florida, Georgia, Idaho, Kentucky, Minnesota, Nebraska, North Carolina, North Dakota, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, South Dakota, Utah, Virginia, Washington, and Wisconsin. The U.S. is on track to surpass the 2,276 infections recorded in 2025\u2014the highest since 1991\u2014and may lose its measles elimination status achieved in 2000. Measles is highly contagious, capable of lingering in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves a room. According to the CDC, about one in five unvaccinated individuals infected with measles require hospitalization, and three in every 1,000 children may die. As of February 2026, no deaths have been reported, but hospitalization rates have increased from 11% in 2025 to 23% in 2026. Vaccination exemptions in U.S. schools reached a record 3.6% in the 2024\u20132025 school year, with 47 states allowing religious or personal belief exemptions. Dr. Mehmet Oz, Administrator of the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, urged the public on CNN\u2019s 'State of the Union' to get vaccinated, stating, 'Take the vaccine, please. We have a solution for our problem.' Symptoms of measles include high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, a rash appearing three to five days after initial symptoms, and Koplik\u2019s spots\u2014tiny white spots inside the mouth\u2014within two to three days of symptom onset. The rash may spread from the head to the rest of the body, and fever can spike above 104\u00b0F.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 07:19 PM\nSource:[USA Today](https://www.usatoday.com/story/graphics/2026/02/10/measles-cases-outbreak-grows-us-2026/88604607007/)\n\n**Mexico on the Brink: Measles Outbreak Approaches 8,500 Cases and Threatens National Health Status**\nM\u00e9xico is facing its most severe measles outbreak in decades, with 8,459 confirmed cases since February 2025 and 27 deaths reported, according to consolidated data from February 2026. The outbreak has prompted the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) to issue a clear warning: if transmission is not interrupted in the coming weeks, Mexico risks losing its official status as a measles-free country. The situation is national but uneven, with Jalisco reporting 1,245 cases in 2026\u2014nearly 60% of the year\u2019s total\u2014while Chihuahua leads the cumulative count with over 4,400 cases since the outbreak began. The most vulnerable group is children aged one to four, who are both at high risk and serve as key vectors for spreading the virus to adults. Experts emphasize that herd immunity requires at least 95% vaccination coverage, but low and uneven vaccination rates across regions\u2014despite over 11.8 million doses administered\u2014have left populations susceptible. In response, states like Jalisco and Nuevo Le\u00f3n are considering reintroducing mask-wearing in crowded indoor spaces as a temporary barrier. PAHO has set a deadline of April 2026 to assess whether measles transmission has become endemic (continuous for 12 months), which would mark a major public health setback. Currently, Mexico accounts for 71% of all measles cases in the Americas, raising regional concerns. The upcoming PAHO meeting in April will determine whether Mexico loses its measles-free status\u2014a designation with significant implications for public health surveillance, tourism, and international credibility. The crisis is not isolated: the U.S. CDC has reported a sharp rise in cases, and Spain saw a jump from 14 cases in 2023 to 229 in 2024, with projections nearing 400 in 2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 04:08 PM\nSource:[Xataka](https://www.xataka.com/medicina-y-salud/mexico-cuerda-floja-brote-sarampion-roza-8-500-casos-pone-jaque-estatus-sanitario-pais)\n\n**Map shows where measles is spreading fastest in 2026**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 416 new measles cases in 14 states since the start of 2026, with nearly all linked to outbreaks that began in 2025. In 2025, the CDC confirmed 2,255 measles cases across 44 states\u2014the highest number since 1991\u2014and nearly 50 separate outbreaks. The largest ongoing outbreak is in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, which has become the worst in the U.S. New cases have also emerged in states bordering South Carolina and several western states. Measles, one of the most contagious viruses, spreads easily through respiratory droplets and can 'spread like a forest fire' in areas with low vaccination rates. The U.S. officially declared measles eliminated in 2000, but the 2025 outbreak\u2014originating in West Texas\u2014has led health experts to warn the country may lose that status. International health authorities plan to meet in April to assess the situation. Measles can be prevented with vaccination, requiring a 95% community immunity threshold; however, the national vaccination rate is currently 92.5%, with many communities falling significantly below that level.

This marks a significant increase from the previous year, when the U.S. recorded 2,255 cases\u2014a 34-year high and over 600% higher than the prior year. The country is approaching a critical deadline: in April, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) committee will assess whether measles has been continuously transmitted in the same chain for 12 months, a key criterion for determining if the U.S. has lost its measles elimination status. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is coordinating with all 50 states to compile genomic sequencing data in preparation for the meeting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 23, 2026 06:53 PM\nSource:[National Post](https://nationalpost.com/news/measles-cases-surging-across-the-u-s-spreading-to-five-more-states)\n\n**Measles Outbreak in the U.S. Worsens: South Carolina Reports Over 600 Cases Amid National Crisis**\nThe measles outbreak in the United States is intensifying, with South Carolina reporting over 600 confirmed cases as of January 20, 2026. Since the outbreak began last autumn, the state has recorded 646 cumulative infections, including cases in elementary schools, high schools, and two universities. Most infected individuals have not been vaccinated. The U.S. has reported over 2,200 cases in 2025, with three deaths, including two young children, and cases continue to rise in 2026. The U.S. is experiencing its worst measles outbreak in over 30 years, threatening its status as a country free of endemic measles since 2000. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed additional cases in eight other states. U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his vaccine skepticism, has been accused of fueling vaccine fear and exacerbating the public health crisis. Mexico is also seeing a surge in cases, and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) will reassess the measles situation in both the U.S. and Mexico in April. Canada reported over 5,000 cases in 2025 and lost its measles-free status in November 2025 after 27 years. Measles causes fever, respiratory symptoms, and rash, and can lead to severe complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis, resulting in long-term disability or death.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 21, 2026 01:49 AM\nSource:[Central News Agency](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/202601210038.aspx)\n\n**Why the US measles review matters as experts warn of wider risk**\nThe United States is under review by international health authorities for potentially losing its measles elimination status, following a significant outbreak that began in West Texas in January 2025. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed 2,144 measles cases across 44 states in 2025\u2014the highest number since 1991\u2014and nearly 50 separate outbreaks. The outbreak originated in Gaines County, Texas, where 762 people were confirmed ill, two children died, and 182 additional cases in children went unconfirmed in March 2025, suggesting a possible undercount of 44%. The virus spread to Utah, Arizona, South Carolina, New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio, Montana, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Mexico, with Mexico reporting 6,000 cases and 21 deaths since February 2025. Genetic sequencing has confirmed the same measles strain across these regions, including in Canada. According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), which will make the final decision at a meeting on April 13, 2026, a country loses elimination status if a single chain of measles transmission persists uninterrupted for 12 months. Despite the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stating there is no evidence of such a chain, experts like Dr. Andrew Pavia and behavioral scientist Noel Brewer believe the case for continuous transmission is strong and predict the U.S. will lose its elimination status. Experts emphasize that the current national vaccination rate of 92.5% is below the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity, and that barriers such as parental vaccine waivers, health care access issues, disinformation, and defunded public health efforts have contributed to the crisis. Dr. Jonathan Temte noted the situation reflects a failure to prioritize a safe and effective vaccine. The CDC\u2019s data remains among the best globally, but reduced investment in public health has weakened contact tracing, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars per case. Experts warn that measles, one of the most contagious viruses (infecting 9 out of 10 unvaccinated people), has found fertile ground in schools, day cares, churches, hospitals, and detention centers. With over 800 cases reported across Utah, Arizona, and South Carolina since late summer 2025 and no end in sight, the future of measles in the U.S. remains uncertain. As Brewer stated, '2025 was the year of measles,' and the trajectory for 2026 is unknown.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 09:22 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/measles-elimination-status-outbreak-states-b2904274.html)\n\n**United States May Lose Measles Elimination Status Amid Widespread Outbreaks**\nThe United States may lose its status as a measles-free country, according to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), which will decide in April 2026 whether the U.S. has sustained endemic transmission of measles for at least 12 consecutive months. The decision follows a major measles outbreak that began in West Texas in January 2025, resulting in 762 confirmed cases and two child deaths, with an estimated 182 unconfirmed cases in Gaines County alone\u2014suggesting a possible 44% underreporting. The outbreak has spread to Utah, Arizona, South Carolina, New Mexico, and Mexico, where over 6,000 cases and 21 deaths have been reported. Genetic sequencing confirms the same measles strain across these regions, including in Canada. Despite the U.S. national vaccination rate being 92.5%\u2014below the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity\u2014many communities fall significantly below this level. Experts, including Dr. Jonathan Temte and Dr. Andrew Pavia, believe the U.S. is likely to lose its elimination status due to sustained transmission, citing weak public health infrastructure, underfunding, and declining vaccine confidence, particularly under the Trump administration. The CDC reported 2,144 measles cases across 44 states in 2024\u2014the highest since 1991. PAHO\u2019s criteria consider cross-border transmission, but experts argue the current standard is outdated. The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services maintains that vaccines are safe and effective, and CDC officials are actively responding to outbreaks. However, contact tracing remains costly and challenging, especially in underserved communities. The situation has prompted widespread concern: '2025 was the year of measles,' said behavioral scientist Noel Brewer, who predicts uncertainty for 2026. Mexico is also under review for its elimination status, with its outbreak linked to Texas.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 06:55 PM\nSource:[AP](https://apnews.com/article/estados-unidos-mexico-brote-sarampion-9a99f60727cb1dd76a3375c5b71336d9)\n\n**At Least 171 Measles Cases Confirmed in Nine U.S. States in Early 2026**\nAt least 171 confirmed cases of measles have been reported across nine U.S. states\u2014Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, and Virginia\u2014in the first weeks of 2026, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The outbreak primarily affects unvaccinated children and is spreading in regions where vaccination coverage has declined in recent years. This surge threatens the U.S. status as a country free from endemic transmission, a designation achieved in 2000. The largest sustained outbreak is in South Carolina, particularly in Spartanburg County, while Utah has reported over 200 cumulative infections since June 2025, with 147 cases in the southwestern region. The current situation represents the highest number of cases in over three decades, surpassing 100 cases in just two weeks. The CDC notes that 2025 saw the highest measles count in 33 years, with 2,242 cases reported across more than 40 states and at least 50 confirmed outbreaks. The 2026 surge is linked to a strain detected in Texas in 2025, as confirmed by public health officials, including David Heaton of the Southwest Utah Department of Public Health, who stated, 'our outbreak corresponds to the same strain detected in Texas in 2025, which demonstrates the connectivity of current hotspots.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 04:29 PM\nSource:[LaPatilla.com](https://lapatilla.com/2026/01/15/al-menos-171-casos-de-sarampion-confirmados-en-nueve-estados-de-eeuu-en-2026/)\n\n**Measles Outbreak in the U.S. Surges to 171 Cases in Nine States in Early 2026, Threatening Elimination Status**\nAt least 171 cases of measles have been confirmed across nine U.S. states\u2014Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, and Virginia\u2014in the first weeks of 2026, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The outbreak, primarily affecting unvaccinated children, marks the highest number of cases in over three decades. The largest sustained outbreak is in South Carolina, particularly in Spartanburg County, while Utah has reported over 200 cumulative infections since June 2025, with 147 cases in the southwest region. The CDC notes that 90% of 2025 cases were linked to outbreaks, with 2,242 cases reported nationwide\u2014the highest in 33 years. In 2024, only 16 outbreaks were recorded, and in 2023, just four. The current 2026 trend already exceeds 100 cases in two weeks. The virus is linked to the same strain detected in Texas in 2025, as confirmed by David Heaton of the Southwest Utah Department of Public Health. The CDC reports that 95% of confirmed cases involved unvaccinated or undetermined individuals; only 2% had one dose of the MMR vaccine, and 2% had the full two-dose series. The majority of cases are in children under 19. The national MMR vaccination rate for kindergarten students dropped to 92.5% in the 2024\u20132025 school year, down from 92.7% the previous year and 95.2% pre-pandemic. The CDC warns that sustained transmission for 12 consecutive months could lead to the U.S. losing its 2000 WHO-recognized status of measles elimination. The agency emphasizes the need for two doses of the MMR vaccine\u2014first between 12\u201315 months and second between 4\u20136 years\u2014for 97% effectiveness. Health authorities have intensified surveillance, mandatory reporting, contact tracing, quarantine protocols, and vaccination campaigns in affected areas. The CDC stresses that measles is one of the most contagious viruses, capable of infecting 9 out of 10 susceptible individuals exposed. Experts warn that vaccination rates below 95% risk sustained outbreaks, even in high-resource countries. The current situation is being closely monitored, with federal and state cooperation deemed essential to prevent sustained transmission.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 01:14 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/estados-unidos/2026/01/15/al-menos-171-casos-de-sarampion-confirmados-en-nueve-estados-de-eeuu-en-las-primeras-semanas-del-ano/)\n\n**U.S. measles cases hit a 30-year high in 2025, CDC data shows - National | Globalnews.ca**\nThe United States recorded 2,144 confirmed measles cases in 2025, marking the highest number since 1992 and a 652% increase from the 285 cases reported in 2024. According to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 93% of infections occurred among unvaccinated individuals, with 43% of cases involving people aged five to 19 and 26% under five years old. Three U.S. deaths were attributed to measles in 2025. Of the 2,144 cases, 2,119 were reported by 45 U.S. jurisdictions, and 25 involved international visitors. Hospitalization occurred in 11% of cases (240 individuals), including 105 children under five. There were 49 outbreaks in 2025, with 88% of cases (1,884 out of 2,144) linked to these outbreaks. In early 2026, three confirmed cases were reported in the first six days. The U.S. could lose its measles elimination status\u2014officially achieved in 2000\u2014by the end of January 2026 if sustained local transmission continues. Canada lost its measles-free status in November 2025 due to an outbreak lasting over a year, and can only regain it after interrupting transmission of the outbreak strain for at least 12 months.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 08, 2026 08:30 PM\nSource:[Global News](https://globalnews.ca/news/11605006/us-measles-cases-30-year-high-2025-cdc/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
