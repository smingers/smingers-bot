February 6, 2026):**\n- First full week of 2026: 279 new cases reported\n- Total cases in 2026 so far: More than 700 cases\n- 2026 is already one of the three worst years for measles infections in the U.S. since 2000\n\n**2025 Data:**\n- Total confirmed cases in 2025: 2,276 cases (highest since 1991, representing a 34-year high)\n- Number of outbreaks in 2025: 49 outbreaks\n- Deaths in 2025: 3 people died (including two young girls)\n- Major outbreaks began in West Texas in February 2025, and along the Utah-Arizona border in October 2025\n\n**Current Outbreak Information:**\n- South Carolina is the current disease epicenter (as of January 27, 2026)\n- More than 500 people in quarantine in South Carolina\n- Hundreds infected in the latest South Carolina outbreak\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Measles was designated as \"eliminated\" in the U.S. in 2000 (meaning no longer constantly circulating)\n- The U.S. is in danger of losing this elimination status following continuous spread\n- 2024 had 16 outbreaks (compared to 49 in 2025)\n- Measles vaccine was introduced in 1963\n\n**General Information:**\n- Article notes that childhood vaccination rates have been declining\n- The article is tracking CDC data on the \"Measles Cases and Outbreaks\" page\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cdc.gov/global-measles-vaccination/data-research/global-measles-outbreaks/index.html\">\n# Summary of \"Global Measles Outbreaks\" (CDC, February 11, 2026)\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Global measles burden (2023)**: An estimated 10.3 million people were infected with measles globally in 2023.\n\n2. **Current outbreak status**: As of February 2026, measles outbreaks are occurring in every region of the world.\n\n3. **U.S. measles elimination status**: Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, but cases and outbreaks continue to occur due to unvaccinated international travelers.\n\n4. **Historical U.S. outbreak reference**: In 2019, the U.S. nearly lost its elimination status with almost 1,300 measles cases from a large outbreak in New York and cases in 30 additional states.\n\n5. **Recent trend**: After a decrease in global measles incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic, measles activity globally and in the United States continues to rise.\n\n6. **Top 10 countries with measles outbreaks (July-December 2025)**:\n   - Yemen: 11,288 cases\n   - Indonesia: 10,744 cases\n   - India: 9,666 cases\n   - Pakistan: 7,361 cases\n   - Angola: 4,843 cases\n   - Lao People's Democratic Republic: 3,167 cases\n   - Mexico: 2,846 cases\n   - Nigeria: 2,755 cases\n   - Afghanistan: 2,668 cases\n   - Mongolia: 2,551 cases\n\n## Key Context:\n\n- The article emphasizes that measles is one of the most contagious human diseases and can easily cross borders.\n- Large U.S. outbreaks are possible when travel-related measles cases reach at-risk U.S. populations with low immunization rates.\n- Data source: Provisional monthly surveillance data reported to WHO (Geneva) as of January 2026.\n\n**Note**: This article does not provide specific U.S. measles case numbers for 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://dph.sc.gov/diseases-conditions/infectious-diseases/measles-rubeola/2025-measles-outbreak\">\n## Summary of Article: \"2025 Measles Outbreak\" from Dph.sc\n\n### Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Outbreak Confirmation**: South Carolina Department of Public Health (DPH) confirmed a measles outbreak in Upstate regions on October 2, 2025.\n\n2. **Case Count**: As of February 10, 2026, DPH is reporting **933 cases of measles** centered around Spartanburg County.\n\n3. **Case Characteristics**: The majority of cases are close contacts of known cases, though the number of public exposure sites indicates community circulation of measles.\n\n4. **Geographic Focus**: The outbreak is centered in Spartanburg County, with some exposure sites also in Sumter County, South Carolina.\n\n### Measles Transmission Information:\n\n- A person is contagious four days before and after a rash begins\n- The virus can linger in the air for up to two hours after an infected person leaves\n- The measles vaccine (MMR and MMRV) is recommended as the best protection\n\n### Update Frequency:\n\nDPH posts measles updates twice weekly (Tuesdays and Fridays at 1 p.m.), though this frequency may change based on disease activity.\n\n### Public Exposure Locations:\n\nEight specific public exposure locations are listed with dates ranging from January 23-30, 2026, including retail stores, restaurants, and government offices in Spartanburg and Sumter counties.\n\n---\n\n**Note**: This article reports on a **state-level outbreak in South Carolina only**, not national U.S. measles case counts. The 933 cases reported are specific to South Carolina's outbreak and would represent only a portion of any national CDC count.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://med.stanford.edu/news/insights/2026/01/measles-in-america--five-things-to-know-from-a-stanford-medicine.html\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Measles in America: Five things to know from a Stanford Medicine expert\"\n\n**Date:** January 28, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **2025 U.S. Measles Cases:** The U.S. had **2,255 confirmed cases of measles in 2025**, nearly eight times as many as in 2024.\n\n2. **Outbreak Data:** Over the last year (presumably 2025), the country had **49 outbreaks spanning nearly every state**.\n\n3. **Elimination Status:** The United States is likely to lose its status as a country that has eliminated measles. Loss of this designation means there has been ongoing domestic spread that has failed to be stopped over the course of a year.\n\n## Expert Opinion (Named Source):\n\n**Dr. Sruti Nadimpalli, MD MPH** (Clinical Associate Professor of Pediatrics, Stanford Medicine, specialist in pediatric infectious disease) provides the following insights:\n\n- **Contagiousness:** Among people without immunity, 90% of those exposed to measles will get sick (compared to 4-12% for influenza among unvaccinated people).\n\n- **Vaccination Requirements:** To stop the spread, 95% of the population needs the two-dose vaccine, but many U.S. communities now have lower rates of vaccine coverage.\n\n- **Transmission:** The virus spreads through the air and viral particles can remain airborne in a room for several hours after an infected person has left. Infected people are contagious for several days before showing symptoms.\n\n- **Vaccine Effectiveness:** The measles vaccine is described as \"very safe and effective, the best protection we have against measles.\"\n\n- **Treatment Limitations:** There is no specific treatment for measles (only supportive care). Unlike chickenpox or COVID-19, no effective antivirals exist for measles.\n\n## Data Sources Referenced:\n\n- The CDC publishes weekly updates on measles numbers\n- The California Department of Public Health tracks activity across the state\n- Federal, state, and local departments of public health publish data showing where measles is spreading\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.citizen-times.com/story/opinion/2026/02/11/opinion-measles-was-once-eliminated-in-us-now-its-becoming-endemic/88283819007/\">\n## Summary of Article from The Asheville Citizen Times\n\n### Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Historical Context**: Measles was declared eliminated from the United States in 2000, with cases stemming from imported sources.\n\n2. **2025 Measles Cases**: According to CDC data, the U.S. reported **2,242 measles cases in 2025** - the highest annual count since 1992.\n\n3. **Historical Range**: Reported U.S. measles cases have ranged from dozens in some years to the 2025 peak.\n\n4. **Vaccine Effectiveness**: Two doses of MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine are **97% effective** at preventing measles.\n\n5. **Economic Cost**: In 2025, one measles case cost roughly **$60,000** in direct medical care, contact investigations, and lost productivity.\n\n6. **Herd Immunity Threshold**: A **95% vaccination rate** in the community generates herd immunity that prevents sustained virus transmission.\n\n### Key Definitions and Context:\n\n- **Measles Elimination Status**: Means the virus has not circulated continuously for 12 months and outbreaks originate from imported cases.\n\n- **Risk of Losing Elimination Status**: Would signal a return to endemic status with continuous circulation within the U.S., increasing risk for vulnerable populations (newborns, immunocompromised individuals).\n\n### Post-Exposure Prophylaxis (PEP) Information:\n\n- IVIG (intravenous immunoglobulin) effective if administered within 6 days of exposure\n- MMR vaccine can be given within 3 days of exposure (for eligible individuals)\n- Quarantine periods: 21-28 days depending on vaccination/treatment status\n\n### Source Attribution:\n\n- Article is an opinion piece by **Dr. Bindu Mayi**, identified as a professor of immunology and microbiology and public health professional with prior CDC and U.S. Army experience\n- CDC data is referenced for case counts\n- Global Advisory Committee on Vaccine Safety (WHO) review cited (January 1999 to August 2025)\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://multco.us/news/new-measles-cases-oregon\">\n# Summary of Article: \"New Measles Cases in Oregon\"\n\n**Source:** Multnomah County  \n**Date:** February 09, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Geographic scope:** As of February 2026, measles cases have been found in Oregon and southwest Washington\n2. **Multnomah County status:** No known measles cases in Multnomah County specifically as of this date\n3. **Specific case numbers:** The article does not provide specific numbers of confirmed cases\n\n## Key Information Relevant to Forecasting:\n\n- This represents an active measles outbreak situation in the Pacific Northwest region as of early February 2026\n- Health officials are \"closely watching the situation\" and warning people who may have been exposed\n- The article notes that \"measles spreads quickly\" and \"it's possible it could spread to our county [Multnomah County]\"\n- The article references that \"cases have also been found in other parts of the United States\" (no specific numbers or locations provided)\n\n## Limitations:\n\nThis is a local public health advisory that does not provide:\n- Specific case counts for Oregon, Washington, or the broader U.S.\n- CDC-level national data\n- Cumulative national totals for 2026\n\nThe article is primarily educational/advisory in nature, warning residents about measles symptoms, transmission, and vaccination recommendations rather than providing detailed epidemiological data.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide CDC-reported U.S. measles case counts by year 2010-2025 and any reported 2026 cases or outbreaks; include dates of first 2026 reports and sizes\nBelow is a consolidated picture of U.S. measles activity as reported by CDC, covering the historical annual case counts (2010-2025) and the situation early in 2026.

Timing of first CDC 2026 reports\n\nThe first publicly documented CDC figure for 2026 that we could locate appears in media coverage citing the agency\u2019s 30 January 2026 web update, which listed 588 confirmed cases (Contagion Live, 12 Feb 2026; UPI, 7 Feb 2026).  Earlier CDC web snapshots from the first half of January were not retrieved in our search, so 30 January 2026 is, for now, the earliest definite date on which CDC posted a 2026 cumulative count.\n\n4.  Size of the principal outbreaks still active in 2026\n\nBecause 662 of the 733 cases in 2026 are continuations of 2025 outbreaks, the outbreak picture is dominated by clusters that began last year:\n\n\u2022 South Carolina outbreak \u2013 920 total cases recorded since onset in Oct 2025, including \u201cmore than 600\u201d of the 2026 U.S. total by late January 2026 (CNN, 27 Jan 2026; UPI, 7 Feb 2026).  This is now the largest U.S. outbreak since measles elimination.\n\n\u2022 Multistate New Mexico\u2013Oklahoma\u2013Texas outbreak of 2025 \u2013 peaked at 762 cases before declared over in Aug 2025 (CNN report, background derived from CDC MMWR 24 Apr 2025).\n\n\u2022 Arizona\u2013Utah border outbreak \u2013 still growing in early 2026, exact total not given by CDC, but identified by CNN as a \u201clarge outbreak\u201d contributing to 2026 numbers (CNN, 27 Jan 2026).  \n\nThe two new 2026 outbreaks together account for only 9 cases so far (CDC update 6 Feb 2026), so essentially all of the 2026 caseload through 5 Feb is spill-over from 2025 clusters, with the South Carolina event providing the majority.\n\n5.  Summary table: CDC measles counts requested\n\nYear | Cases  \n2010 63  \n2011 220  \n2012 55  \n2013 187  \n2014 667  \n2015 188  \n2016 86  \n2017 120  \n2018 375  \n2019 1 282  \n2020 13  \n2021 49  \n2022 121  \n2023 59  \n2024 285  \n2025 2 276  \n2026 733 (as of 5 Feb 2026)\n\n6.  Information gaps identified\n\n\u2022 Exact date of CDC\u2019s first 2026 posting and the precise figure on that date (the earliest secure reference we found is 30 Jan 2026 with 588 cases).  A Wayback Machine crawl of the CDC page for early January would pin this down.\n\n\u2022 Granular size of each ongoing multi-state outbreak (CDC currently rolls them into one \u2018continued\u2019 total).  Jurisdiction-level press releases or CDC\u2019s internal epi-curve PDF (often linked later in the season) could provide this.\n\n\u2022 Official CDC year-final 2026 tally will not be known until the update covering data through Thursday 30 April 2026, the reference point for the forecasting question.\n\nIf finer detail on early-2026 posting dates or jurisdiction-specific outbreak totals is required, additional narrow searches (e.g., \u201csite:web.archive.org measles cases and outbreaks January 2026\u201d or \u201cCDC measles epi curve pdf February 2026\u201d) would be appropriate.</Agent_report>\n"
