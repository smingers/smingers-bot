Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Yahoo Finance/PitchBook (Feb 12, 2026):**
Factual content: Gail Slater stepping down as DOJ antitrust chief; Omeed Assefi named acting chief; DOJ approved Alphabet's $32B Wiz acquisition in late 2025; conflicts over HPE-Juniper merger. Expert opinion from Matt Adler (Baker Botts): leadership transitions lead to fewer decisive actions and fewer deal blocks. High-quality, current source. Key fact: No DOJ merger challenges against Big Tech mentioned.

**DOJ Document (corrupted extraction):**
Unusable - extraction failed completely.

**FTC Merger Review (Oct 2018):**
Background on FTC/DOJ shared jurisdiction. Lists Microsoft/Activision case (FTC matter, not DOJ). Dated source, primarily procedural information. Not directly relevant to DOJ merger challenges.

**White & Case (Jan 15, 2026):**
Discusses AI regulation and FTC actions. Commissioner Ferguson's statement warns against premature AI regulation. Mentions FTC investigations of cloud providers (Alphabet, Amazon, Microsoft) and AI partnerships. No DOJ merger challenges mentioned. High-quality legal analysis but FTC-focused.

**PYMNTS/Reuters (date unclear, references Feb 10, 2026 deadline):**
EU review of Google-Wiz deal; U.S. regulators cleared it in late 2025. This confirms no DOJ challenge to the Wiz acquisition. Moderate quality, factual reporting.

**Goodwin Law (Q1 2025 review):**
Critical source: Documents DOJ filed suit Jan 30, 2025 to block HPE/Juniper merger. However, neither HPE nor Juniper is among the five specified Big Tech firms (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft). IBM/HashiCorp cleared by FTC. Google/Wiz announced but not challenged. High-quality legal analysis.

**AskNews Articles:**

1. **Federal court vacates FTC HSR rules (Feb 13, 2026):** Procedural ruling affecting merger filing requirements. No direct impact on DOJ challenges. High quality, factual.

2. **Slater resignation articles (Feb 13, 2026, multiple sources):** Confirm Slater resigned/fired Feb 12-13, 2026. Omeed Assefi now acting chief. Conflicts over HPE-Juniper (not Big Tech). Allegations of lobbying influence. High-quality reporting from multiple sources. Key fact: Leadership vacuum during the prediction window.

3. **Meta/YouTube trial (Feb 13, 2026):** Product liability case, not merger-related. Not relevant.

4. **Netflix-WBD merger review (Feb 13, 2026):** Slater was reviewing this deal. Neither Netflix nor WBD is among the five Big Tech firms. Moderate quality.

5. **Business groups letter (Feb 13, 2026):** Urges Trump to maintain "muscular antitrust." References ongoing cases (Live Nation, Visa, Apple, Google) but these are monopolization cases, not merger challenges. Moderate quality advocacy piece.

6. **Trump 2.0 enforcement review (Jan 26, 2026):** Comprehensive legal analysis. Notes DOJ challenged HPE-Juniper (not Big Tech), settled controversially. DOJ issued second request on Netflix-WBD merger. No Big Tech merger challenges mentioned. High-quality legal source.

7. **FTC HSR threshold increase (Jan 22, 2026):** Procedural update, not directly relevant.

8. **2026 Big Tech preview (Jan 22, 2026):** Reviews ongoing monopolization cases (Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple, Microsoft) but no merger challenges mentioned. High-quality legal analysis.

9. **State antitrust enforcement (Jan 9, 2026):** Discusses state-level activity. Notes states challenging DOJ's HPE-Juniper settlement. Not directly relevant to DOJ Big Tech merger challenges.

10. **Meta monopoly ruling (Dec 17, 2025):** Court ruled Meta doesn't maintain illegal monopoly. Discusses past acquisitions (Instagram, WhatsApp) but no current merger challenges. High-quality analysis.

11. **State AGs intervene in HPE-Juniper (Oct 14-15, 2025):** 13 states challenging DOJ settlement. Not Big Tech firms. Factual reporting, high quality.

12. **Q2 2025 antitrust update (Oct 20, 2025):** Reviews HPE-Juniper challenge and settlement. Discusses AI "acquihire" deals. Google's $2.4B Windsurf deal mentioned but not as formal merger challenge. High-quality legal analysis.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Zero DOJ merger challenges against the five Big Tech firms in recent history:** Multiple independent sources (agent report, legal analyses, DOJ database search) confirm no DOJ civil merger complaints filed against Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, or Microsoft in the past 15+ years that went to litigation. This is the strongest structural evidence.
- **Leadership vacuum at DOJ Antitrust Division:** Multiple reliable sources confirm Slater's departure Feb 12-13, 2026, with Assefi as acting chief. Expert opinion (Matt Adler) states transitions lead to "fewer decisive actions, fewer blocks." This directly impacts the 75-day prediction window.
- **Jurisdictional pattern:** FTC handles most Big Tech mergers (confirmed by multiple legal sources). DOJ focused on monopolization cases (Google, Apple) not merger challenges.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Short timeframe (75 days):** Only 2.5 months for a merger to be announced, reviewed, and challenged. Typical timeline is 6-12 months minimum. This temporal constraint significantly limits probability.
- **Google-Wiz cleared in late 2025:** DOJ approved Alphabet's largest-ever acquisition ($32B) without challenge. Demonstrates current enforcement posture toward Big Tech mergers.
- **Netflix-WBD under review:** DOJ issued second request, but neither firm is among the five specified. Shows DOJ merger activity exists but not targeting the specified companies.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Political pressure allegations:** Multiple sources report lobbying influence on HPE-Juniper settlement, but this involved non-Big Tech firms and doesn't directly predict future Big Tech merger challenges.
- **Business groups urging enforcement:** Advocacy letter requesting continued antitrust enforcement is aspirational, not predictive of actual DOJ actions.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window:** February 15, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = 75 days

**If halved (37-38 days):** Probability of any challenge would drop to near-zero. Insufficient time for even an already-announced merger to be reviewed and challenged.

**If doubled (150 days/5 months):** Probability would increase modestly, perhaps to 15-20% for one challenge. Five months allows time for a merger announcement and initial review, though still compressed compared to typical timelines.

**Current timeframe impact:** The 75-day window is critically constraining. For a DOJ challenge to occur, one of the five Big Tech firms would need to:
1. Announce a significant acquisition (or have one already under confidential review)
2. Have DOJ (not FTC) receive jurisdictional clearance
3. Complete initial HSR review
4. Have DOJ determine challenge is warranted
5. File complaint in district court

All within 75 days. This is structurally very difficult.

## (d) Justification

**Factors maintaining low base rate:**

1. **Zero historical precedent:** The 15+ year base rate of zero DOJ merger challenges against these five firms is the dominant factor. This isn't a small sample size issue—it reflects structural jurisdictional division and enforcement priorities.

2. **Leadership transition:** Slater's departure on Feb 12-13, 2026 leaves Assefi as acting chief for the entire prediction window. Expert opinion confirms transitions reduce decisive enforcement actions. This reinforces the low base rate rather than shifting it.

3. **Recent enforcement pattern:** DOJ approved Google-Wiz ($32B) in late 2025 without challenge, the largest Google acquisition ever. This demonstrates current posture toward Big Tech mergers is permissive.

4. **Timeframe constraint:** 75 days is structurally insufficient for the typical merger review and challenge process. This is a hard constraint, not a soft one.

**Factors that could shift prediction upward (but don't):**

1. **Ongoing reviews:** Netflix-WBD under DOJ review, but neither is a specified Big Tech firm. No evidence of similar reviews for the five target companies.

2. **Political pressure:** Business groups urging enforcement, but this is advocacy without concrete action or announced mergers to target.

3. **Trump administration rhetoric:** Maintains Big Tech scrutiny, but has focused on monopolization cases, not merger challenges.

**Conclusion:** Current circumstances do not materially differ from the reference class. The base rate of zero remains highly applicable. The leadership vacuum and short timeframe actually reinforce the low probability rather than challenging it.

## Distribution Calibration

**Modal outcome:** 0 lawsuits (85-90% probability)

**Reasoning for non-zero tail:**
- 10-15% chance of 1 lawsuit accounts for:
  - Possible confidential merger under review
  - Unexpected rapid announcement and challenge
  - Political intervention accelerating enforcement
  
- <5% chance of 2+ lawsuits would require multiple Big Tech mergers challenged within 75 days, which is virtually impossible given historical patterns and timeframe

**Calibration considerations:**

1. **Lower bound (10th percentile):** Should be 0. Very high confidence that outcome won't be negative or unexpectedly low.

2. **Median (50th percentile):** Should be 0. More likely than not that no challenges occur.

3. **Upper bound (90th percentile):** Should be 1, possibly 2 to account for unknown unknowns. Setting at 2 provides buffer for unexpected events while remaining grounded in structural constraints.

4. **Distribution shape:** Heavy concentration at 0, with small probability mass at 1, and minimal mass at 2+. This reflects a Poisson-like distribution with very low lambda (λ ≈ 0.1-0.15).

**Testing ±10% shifts:**
- If I shifted 90th percentile from 1 to 2: Would account for possibility of two surprise mergers, but this seems overly cautious given 75-day window.
- If I shifted 80th percentile from 0 to 1: Would imply 20% chance of at least one challenge, which seems reasonable given uncertainties.
- If I shifted 60th percentile from 0 to 1: Would imply 40% chance of at least one challenge, which seems too high given base rate and timeframe.

**Final calibration:**
- 10th-60th percentiles: 0 (reflecting high probability of zero challenges)
- 70th-80th percentiles: Transition point where 1 challenge becomes possible
- 90th percentile: 1 or 2 to account for tail risk

Given the evidence, I'll set:
- 10-60th: 0 (high confidence in modal outcome)
- 80th: 1 (acknowledging ~20% chance of one challenge)
- 90th: 2 (conservative tail accounting for multiple surprises)

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** Number of DOJ civil antitrust merger complaints filed in U.S. District Court against Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, or Microsoft (or subsidiaries) between Feb 15, 2026 and May 1, 2026. Units: lawsuits. Window: 75 days.

2. **Base rate alignment:** Outside view established 10th-80th percentile at 0, 90th at 1. My inside view maintains this distribution with slight adjustment to 90th percentile to 2 for additional tail risk. Strong alignment maintained.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 0; mean ≈ 0.15-0.25. This makes sense: most likely outcome is zero, with small probability of one or two challenges pulling mean slightly above zero.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - Zero DOJ merger challenges against these five firms in 15+ years (verified across multiple sources)
   - Slater resigned Feb 12-13, 2026; acting chief during entire window (verified, multiple sources)
   - 75-day timeframe insufficient for typical merger review process (structural constraint)
   - Google-Wiz ($32B) approved late 2025 without challenge (verified, multiple sources)
   - FTC, not DOJ, handles most Big Tech mergers (verified, legal analyses)

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** A major Big Tech acquisition is already under confidential DOJ review and will be challenged in March-April 2026. This would push outcome UP to 1. Probability: ~10-15%.

6. **Status quo outcome:** Status quo is zero DOJ merger challenges against these firms. Given low volatility in enforcement patterns and leadership vacuum, status quo strongly favored. No adjustment needed.

7. **Technicalities:** Values strictly increasing: 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 2. Units: lawsuits (matches question). Range: within bounds (-0.5 to 10.5+). ✓
