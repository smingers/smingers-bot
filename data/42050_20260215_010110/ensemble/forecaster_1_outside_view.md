Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical Context Sources:**

1. **Microsoft Antitrust Case (1998)** - Investopedia and DOJ findings: Historical background on the 1998 monopolization case. Not relevant to merger challenges or current Big Tech enforcement. High quality but dated.

2. **FTC v. Microsoft/Activision** - Harvard Law Review (Jan 2024): Detailed analysis of the FTC's (not DOJ's) attempt to block Microsoft's $68.7B Activision acquisition. The case was ultimately approved in July 2023. High-quality legal analysis but involves FTC, not DOJ. This does NOT count toward the question.

3. **HPE-Juniper Merger** - Jacobin (Aug 2025): Reports that DOJ initially filed to block HPE's $14B acquisition of Juniper in January 2025, then reversed course after lobbying. Neither HPE nor Juniper is a Big Tech company per the question's definition. Opinion-heavy source but contains factual timeline.

4. **Trump 2.0 Antitrust Review** - Faegre Drinker (date unclear, references events through April 2025): Legal analysis noting Chair Ferguson's April 2025 statement about continuing lawsuits against large tech companies. However, no specific merger challenges mentioned. High-quality legal source.

5. **DOJ v. Visa** - Reason Foundation (Oct 2025): Discusses September 2024 DOJ monopolization lawsuit against Visa. This is NOT a merger challenge and Visa is NOT one of the five Big Tech firms. Opinion piece from libertarian think tank.

6. **DOJ v. Google (Ad Tech)** - NYT/Court ruling (April 2025): Details the January 2023 DOJ monopolization case against Google's ad tech practices. This is NOT a merger challenge. High-quality primary source.

7. **Google Ad Tech Lawsuit** - The Guardian (Jan 2023): Reports the filing of the ad tech monopolization case. Not a merger challenge.

8. **DOJ Case Filings Database** - Partial alphabetical listing mentioning U.S. v. Activision Blizzard, but this was an FTC matter, not DOJ.

**Agent Report:**

Comprehensive search of DOJ records from 2023-present finding ZERO DOJ civil merger complaints filed against any of the five Big Tech firms (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft). The report correctly distinguishes between:
- FTC actions (Amazon, Meta, Microsoft/Activision)
- DOJ monopolization cases (Google Search, Google Ad Tech, Apple)
- Merger challenges (none found)

The agent notes that platform merger oversight has primarily been FTC jurisdiction, not DOJ. High-quality systematic analysis.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **DOJ merger challenges against Big Tech (2010-2026)**: Most relevant but extremely sparse data. The last clear DOJ merger challenge against these firms was Google/ITA Software (2011), which ended in consent decree without litigation.

2. **All DOJ merger challenges (recent years)**: Broader but includes many non-tech sectors. DOJ files 20-40 merger challenges annually across all industries, but Big Tech represents a tiny fraction.

3. **FTC + DOJ Big Tech merger enforcement**: More data points but mixes two agencies. FTC has been more active (Microsoft/Activision, Amazon/iRobot, Meta/Within). However, the question specifically asks about DOJ only.

4. **Big Tech antitrust enforcement broadly**: Includes monopolization cases, which are far more common than merger challenges. This would overestimate merger-specific activity.

**Selected Reference Class:** DOJ merger challenges against Big Tech firms (2010-2026), supplemented by understanding of jurisdictional division between FTC and DOJ.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window:** February 15, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = 75 days (2.5 months)

**Historical Pattern:**
- 2010-2023: Zero DOJ merger complaints filed against the five Big Tech firms that went to litigation
- 2023-Feb 2026: Zero DOJ merger complaints filed (per agent report)
- FTC has been the primary agency for Big Tech mergers (Activision, iRobot, Within)
- DOJ has focused on monopolization cases (Google Search 2020, Google Ad Tech 2023, Apple 2024)

**Structural Factors:**
- Jurisdictional clearance: FTC typically gets Big Tech mergers
- Trump Administration (Jan 2025-present): Gail Slater stated Big Tech remains a priority but prefers case-by-case approach
- Short timeframe: 2.5 months is very brief for a merger to be announced, reviewed, and challenged
- Typical timeline: Major merger announcement → HSR review (30+ days) → investigation → complaint filing takes 6-12 months minimum

## (d) Justification

The outside view strongly suggests the answer will be 0 or very close to 0:

1. **Base rate is extremely low**: Zero DOJ merger complaints against these five firms in the past 15+ years that resulted in litigation.

2. **Jurisdictional pattern**: FTC, not DOJ, handles most Big Tech merger reviews. This institutional division makes DOJ action inherently less likely.

3. **Short timeframe**: 75 days is insufficient for a major acquisition to be announced and challenged unless a deal is already in advanced stages (none publicly known as of Feb 15, 2026).

4. **Current enforcement posture**: While Trump Administration maintains Big Tech scrutiny, the focus has been on existing monopolization cases rather than new merger challenges.

5. **Required conditions for non-zero outcome**: Would need (a) a Big Tech firm to announce a significant acquisition, (b) DOJ rather than FTC to get clearance, (c) DOJ to determine challenge is warranted, and (d) all this to occur within 75 days.

The most likely outcome is 0. A value of 1 is possible but would require an unusual confluence of events. Values of 2+ are extremely unlikely given the timeframe and historical patterns.

## Outside View Calibration

**Distribution Considerations:**

1. **Modal outcome**: 0 lawsuits (>80% probability based on base rate and timeframe)

2. **Tail risk**: Small but non-zero chance of 1 lawsuit if:
   - A Big Tech acquisition is already under confidential review
   - Political pressure accelerates enforcement
   - An unexpected deal is announced and fast-tracked

3. **Upper bound reasoning**: 
   - 2 lawsuits would require two separate Big Tech mergers to be challenged within 75 days
   - 3+ lawsuits is virtually impossible given historical patterns and timeframe
   - Even in the most aggressive enforcement period (Biden Administration 2021-2024), DOJ filed zero merger complaints against these five firms

4. **Calibration to historical distributions**: 
   - Poisson distribution with λ ≈ 0.05-0.1 (reflecting very low base rate)
   - Heavy concentration at 0, small probability mass at 1, negligible beyond that

5. **Accounting for uncertainty**:
   - Unknown unknowns: Confidential merger negotiations, political interventions
   - But 75-day window severely constrains possibilities
   - 10th percentile should be 0 (high confidence in lower bound)
   - 90th percentile should be 1 or possibly 2 (allowing for one surprise event, maybe two)
