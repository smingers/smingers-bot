Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological highlights, facts ≠ opinion)

1. Yahoo Finance (12 Feb 2026, Rosie Bradbury) – Factual: DOJ antitrust chief Gail Slater forced out; acting chief Omeed Assefi named. Experts (Baker Botts’ Matt Adler) predict fewer merger challenges during leadership transition. Good quality/recent → relevant.
2. National Law Review (13 Feb 2026) – Factual: HSR “long-form” rules vacated; if stay lapses, filings become simpler. Reliable legal trade press → slightly lowers near-term frictions for deals. Moderate relevance.
3. Multiple 13 Feb 2026 pieces (Yahoo, Fox Business, NY Post, etc.) – All agree Slater exit stemmed from internal conflict and signals uncertain policy direction. Quality varies but facts (date, resignation, acting chief) corroborated by several outlets → strong evidence of organisational disruption.
4. JD Supra (26 Jan 2026) – Quarterly practitioner memo: Trump-era DOJ more settlement-oriented, criticised for political influence, but still pursuing some big cases (Live Nation). Reliable synthesis; relevant trend signal.
5. Goodwin Law Q1 2025 update – Shows Google/Wiz cleared, HPE/Juniper challenge did NOT involve Big Tech. Confirms rarity of DOJ Big Tech merger suits. High quality but older.
6. DOJ case-filings database (implicit) – No Big Tech merger complaints since at least 2021. Primary data → strongest baseline evidence.

(b) Evidence analysis (strength tags)
• Structural: DOJ historically files ≈0 Big Tech merger suits per year (Strong).  
• Leadership vacuum & transition slow action (Strong – multiple independent reports).  
• Trump-era tilt toward settlements/clearances (Moderate).  
• Simpler HSR form may slightly raise filing volume but cuts review time, reducing likelihood of late-stage lawsuit before 1 May 2026 (Weak-Moderate).  
• Possibility of surprise mega-deal (Weak – purely speculative, no rumoured transactions).

(c) Timeframe analysis
Window = 75 days (≈0.21 yr). If halved (38 days) my mean would drop ~40%; if doubled (150 days) mean would roughly double but still <0.4 because base rate is near-zero.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift
Outside-view Poisson λ≈0.18 (80-90 % chance of 0 in 75 d) from historic data.  
Inside-view adjusts λ downward to ≈0.15 because  
1. Acting leadership + turmoil lowers appetite for new litigation.  
2. No public Big Tech deals currently in second-request stage.  
3. Political pressure for “muscular” enforcement is present but diffused and likely to focus on existing conduct cases.  
These factors render the reference class still appropriate; only modest downward tweak.

Distribution calibration
Mean ≈0.15, Var≈0.15 (slightly over-dispersed). Converted to percentiles (strictly increasing by using fractional counts):

Percentile 10: 0.00  
Percentile 20: 0.01  
Percentile 40: 0.05  
Percentile 60: 0.20  
Percentile 80: 0.80  
Percentile 90: 1.40  

Checklist:
1. Target variable: # of new DOJ civil merger-blocking lawsuits vs Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft filed 15 Feb–1 May 2026.  
2. Outside-view base: λ≈0.18 (mostly 0; occasional 1).  
3. Consistency check: implied median ≈0; mean ≈0.15; aligns with reasoning.  
4. Key evidence: (i) zero historical suits, (ii) leadership void, (iii) lower Trump enforcement, (iv) no known pending Big Tech deals, (v) 75-day window.  
5. Blind-spot: A secret, near-closing Big Tech acquisition (e.g., Amazon-DoorDash) already deep in review – would push outcome to 1–2.  
6. Status-quo outcome is 0; forecast remains close but allows 15 % mass on ≥1.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, within unit bounds (lawsuits), no scientific notation.
