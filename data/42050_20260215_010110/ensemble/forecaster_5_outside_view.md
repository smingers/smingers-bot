Analysis:
a)  Source analysis  
1. Investopedia & DOJ-Microsoft findings (1998–2000) – Reliable primary/historical material, shows the DOJ uses Section 2 conduct cases against Big Tech but not merger challenges.  Factual, no bearing on 2026 window except to establish a long-run base rate close to zero.  
2. Harvard Law Review note on FTC v. Microsoft/Activision (2024) – Scholarly, but concerns an FTC vertical-merger suit, not DOJ.  Confirms that, even for very large tech mergers, the FTC rather than DOJ has usually taken jurisdiction.  
3. Jacobin (2025) – Opinionated magazine piece about an HPE-Juniper matter (not Big Tech); factual core: DOJ sometimes files a complaint and later settles.  Illustrates that the Antitrust Division does litigate mergers, but almost never against the five target firms.  
4. Faegre-Drinker client memo (Apr 2025) – Specialist antitrust bar source; reliable for inside-baseball agency practice.  Notes that (i) the 2023 Merger Guidelines remain in force and (ii) new AAG Gail Slater “intends to continue lawsuits against large tech companies,” yet it lists no DOJ Big-Tech merger cases.  Indicates rhetoric > action so far.  
5. Reason Foundation (Oct 2025) & NY Times (Apr 2025) – Describe current DOJ conduct suits (Visa; Google ads).  Again underscore that recent Big-Tech-related DOJ activity has been conduct, not merger.  
6. DOJ Antitrust Case-Filings index (Aug 2023 snapshot) – Primary source.  A search through the live database shows zero Section 7 merger complaints naming Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta or Microsoft after 2012.  
7. Agent report (today) – Consolidates a PACER/database sweep through 2026-02-15: still zero qualifying complaints.  Methodology transparent and replicable.  

Quality gradient: Primary dockets/database > major newspapers/legal trade memos > think-tank/advocacy magazines.  All sources agree on the key fact: no DOJ Big-Tech merger complaints in the last decade and none pending today.

b)  Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
i) DOJ Section 7 merger complaints against any firm (≈ 20–30 per year 2015-2024; mean ≈ 0.06 per day).  
ii) …against Fortune-50 firms (≈ 1 per year).  
iii) …against the five Big-Tech firms (0 in 15 years).  
Because the forecasting target is exactly class (iii), that is the most diagnostic reference class; its observed base rate is 0 ⁄ 15 years = 0 per year.  The broader classes illustrate that while the Antitrust Division sues fairly often, jurisdictional splits (FTC vs DOJ) plus Big-Tech deal scarcity make the event extremely rare.

c)  Time-frame analysis  
Resolution window: 15 Feb 2026 → 01 May 2026 = 75 days (≈ 0.205 years).  
Historical pattern: even in peak years the DOJ averaged < 0.1 merger complaints per day across the entire economy; against Big Tech, 0 total over 15 years.  The expected count in any random 75-day slice is therefore far below one.  Moreover, no sizeable Big-Tech acquisitions are publicly under HSR review today, making a brand-new suit before 01 May 2026 unlikely.

d)  Justification for baseline  
1. Base-rate: 0 complaints in 15 years ⇒ expected λ ≈ 0.000 ? per year; in a 0.205-year window the Poisson mean is effectively 0.00 – 0.02.  
2. Inside tweaks:  
   • Political rhetoric from AAG Slater suggests some appetite, but the DOJ will need a qualifying merger to appear, be reviewed, and reach litigation stage—all within 75 days.  None is on the public calendar.  
   • FTC retains first-call jurisdiction over most platform deals; inter-agency reallocation this late in the review pipeline is rare.  
   • Unknown-unknown tail: a surprise “killer acquisition” (e.g., Apple announces a $50 bn AR-headset rival tomorrow) could provoke an immediate filing.  Historically, only ~5 % of HSR-reportable deals jump straight to court that quickly, so tail risk is low but non-zero.

Outside view calibration:
I model the count as a zero-inflated Poisson.  
• 80 % mass on exactly 0 (status-quo, no major Big-Tech deal).  
• 17 % on exactly 1 (one surprise deal rapidly litigated).  
• 3 % on 2 + (extreme tail: multiple blockbuster acquisitions or a DOJ “sweep” theory suit naming two deals).  
Mapping cumulative probabilities to strictly increasing percentiles yields the following staircase (using fractional cut-points between integers):

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 0  
Percentile 20: 0.001  
Percentile 40: 0.10  
Percentile 60: 0.30  
Percentile 80: 1  
Percentile 90: 2
