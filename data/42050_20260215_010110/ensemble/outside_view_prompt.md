# Summary of Article: Microsoft Antitrust Case: Understanding the 1998 Charges and Impact

## Key Facts and Timeline:
- **May 18, 1998**: The U.S. Department of Justice and attorneys general from 20 states filed antitrust charges against Microsoft
- The case centered on whether Microsoft's bundling of additional programs (particularly Internet Explorer browser) into its Windows operating system constituted monopolistic actions
- The lawsuit followed "browser wars" that led to Netscape's collapse after Microsoft began giving away its browser software for free

## Legal Proceedings and Outcome:
- **Initial Ruling**: Judge Thomas Penfield Jackson ruled that Microsoft violated parts of the Sherman Antitrust Act (established in 1890)
- Jackson initially ordered Microsoft to split into two separate entities ("baby Bills") - one for the operating system and one for software
- **Appeal**: Microsoft appealed the decision, citing judicial bias
- The appeals court overturned Jackson's breakup order
- **Settlement**: The DOJ abandoned the breakup requirement; Microsoft agreed to share computing interfaces with other companies and remained intact

## Background Context:
- Federal authorities became concerned about Microsoft's market presence in the early 1990s
- The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) initially investigated but closed its case before the DOJ picked it up
- The government accused Microsoft of making it difficult for consumers to install competing software and uninstall Internet Explorer

## Post-Case Impact:
- Microsoft's market share eroded after the case due to competition
- The article notes ongoing debate about whether antitrust cases against "non-coercive monopolies" are necessary or if free market competition can address such situations without government intervention

**Note**: This article is historical background about a 1998 case and does not contain information about current or future DOJ merger challenges against Big Tech firms.

# Summary of Article: U.S. V. Microsoft: Court's Findings Of Fact

**Article Type:** Historical legal document (Court findings from a 1998-1999 antitrust case)

**Key Facts:**

1. **Case Details:** This is a civil antitrust action against Microsoft Corporation alleging violations of the Sherman Act, §§ 1 and 2, and various state statutes. The case was tried between October 19, 1998, and June 24, 1999 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (Civil Action No. 98-1233).

2. **Microsoft Background:** Microsoft Corporation is organized under Washington State law with headquarters in Redmond, Washington. The company has focused primarily on developing and licensing software.

3. **Product History:** 
   - 1981: Released MS-DOS (Microsoft Disk Operating System)
   - 1985: Began shipping Windows (initially a graphical user interface shell on top of MS-DOS)
   - 1995: Introduced Windows 95
   - June 1998: Released Windows 98

4. **Market Position:** Microsoft is described as "the leading supplier of operating systems for PCs" and "transacts business in all fifty of the United States and in most countries around the world."

5. **Business Model:** Microsoft licenses software directly to consumers, but the largest part of MS-DOS and Windows sales consists of licensing to PC manufacturers (OEMs) like IBM and Compaq, who pre-install Windows before selling to consumers.

**Relevance to Forecasting Question:**

This article describes a **historical** antitrust case against Microsoft from 1998-1999. It does not contain information about new civil antitrust merger challenges filed by the DOJ against Big Tech firms, nor does it relate to merger or acquisition blocking efforts. This was a monopolization case, not a merger challenge. The article provides no information relevant to forecasting future DOJ merger challenges before May 1, 2026.

# Summary of "FTC v. Microsoft Corp." - Harvard Law Review

**Article Metadata:**
- Source: Harvard Law Review
- Date: January 10, 2024
- Author: hlr

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Merger Details:**
   - In January 2022, Microsoft announced its intent to acquire Activision Blizzard for $68.7 billion
   - This was described as "the largest merger in tech history"
   - Activision produces games including Call of Duty, Candy Crush, Overwatch, and World of Warcraft

2. **Timeline of Legal Action:**
   - December 2022: FTC filed an administrative complaint to block the merger
   - June 2023: FTC filed a complaint in the Northern District of California seeking a temporary restraining order and preliminary injunction
   - The court granted the temporary restraining order initially
   - The court then denied the FTC's motion for a preliminary injunction, dissolved the restraining order, and dismissed the case
   - July 13, 2023: FTC moved for an injunction pending appeal
   - July 14, 2023: Ninth Circuit denied the motion
   - July 16, 2023: Microsoft and Sony signed a ten-year deal to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation consoles
   - July 20, 2023: FTC withdrew its administrative challenge
   - September 26, 2023: FTC returned the matter to adjudication

3. **Legal Basis:**
   - The FTC alleged the merger violated section 7 of the Clayton Act and section 5 of the FTC Act
   - The complaint alleged Microsoft would prevent Activision's content from being played on rival devices and services

4. **Court's Findings:**
   - The court found the merged firm would have the ability to foreclose Call of Duty games but would not have the incentive to do so
   - The court rejected the FTC's foreclosure theory based on Microsoft's commitments to its board and competitors, internal communications, and the importance of cross-platform play to Call of Duty's success
   - The court rejected the FTC's expert testimony that Microsoft would find it profitable to withhold Call of Duty

## Context on Antitrust Enforcement Trends:

- The article notes that despite increased merger volume over the last forty years, antitrust enforcement has been in decline
- In 2018, the DOJ challenged a vertical merger between AT&T and Time Warner Cable and lost
- In 2020, the FTC and DOJ issued new vertical merger guidelines, but the FTC withdrew them in 2021

## Analysis/Opinions (from article author):

The article argues that the FTC's case revealed "defective translation of facts into legal liability" and that the FTC failed to recognize key market trends, particularly the growth of mobile gaming and the status of AAA games in the market.

**Note:** This case involved the FTC, not the DOJ, challenging a merger. The article discusses it as an example of recent antitrust enforcement trends but does not represent a DOJ civil antitrust merger challenge.

# Summary of Article: "The Big Tech Lobby Has the DOJ in a Stranglehold"

**Source:** Jacobin

## Key Facts and Events:

1. **HPE-Juniper Merger Details:**
   - Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) pursued a $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks
   - The DOJ initially filed a lawsuit to block this merger
   - The lawsuit was filed in January (year not specified in article, but context suggests 2025)
   - The case was weeks away from trial when the DOJ reversed course
   - The merger was ultimately approved with a consent decree instead

2. **Market Competition Concerns:**
   - HPE and Juniper Networks are described as "head-to-head competitors in the market of Wi-Fi systems"
   - The initial DOJ complaint cited anticompetitive concerns
   - According to the lawsuit, the merger would increase Wi-Fi costs that would be passed to consumers

3. **Lobbying Campaign:**
   - HPE conducted a lobbying campaign after the initial lawsuit was filed
   - HPE paid $1 million each to Arthur Schwartz (confidant of Don Trump Jr. and VP J.D. Vance) and Mike Davis (described as "MAGA antitrust whisperer")
   - HPE also paid Will Levi, a partner at Sidley Austin who served as chief of staff to the Attorney General during Trump's first term
   - This lobbying circumvented traditional disclosure requirements

4. **DOJ Internal Actions:**
   - Chad Mizelle (AG Pam Bondi's chief of staff) overruled antitrust chief Gail Slater
   - Mizelle fired two of Slater's top deputies who disagreed with his decision
   - The article describes this as exposing "major rifts within the GOP coalition"

5. **Legal Disclosure:**
   - The lobbying came to light due to the Tunney Act (a 1974 anti-corruption law)
   - Legal services disclosures were submitted last week (relative to article publication)
   - First reported by the Capitol Forum
   - The consent decree could potentially be rejected by a district court judge as a Tunney Act violation

6. **National Security Claim:**
   - Trump officials told Axios that "intelligence authorities intervened to rubber-stamp the deal because of national security reasons"
   - This claim never appeared in DOJ or HPE legal briefs

## Context on Broader DOJ Actions:
- The article mentions ongoing Biden-era lawsuits against Apple, Visa, and Ticketmaster that are threatened by this corruption culture

**Note:** This article is from Jacobin, which has a left-leaning editorial perspective. The article uses charged language ("corporate coup attempt," "graft," "pay-to-play corruption") that reflects opinion rather than neutral reporting.

# Summary of Article: "A Review of Early Antitrust Enforcement Under Trump 2.0"

**Source:** Faegre Drinker Biddle & Reath LLP

## Key Facts and Developments:

### FTC Leadership Changes
- President Trump removed two Democratic FTC commissioners (Bedoya and Slaughter) early in his second term
- The removed commissioners filed a lawsuit in U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, arguing commissioners can only be removed "for cause" under the 1935 Supreme Court precedent *Humphrey's Executor v. United States*
- Former FTC Chair Lina Khan (appointed by Biden) vacated her position at the beginning of Trump's second term
- Andrew Ferguson is the new FTC Chair, and Melissa Holyoak is another Republican commissioner
- The FTC can continue to operate with only two commissioners without requiring a quorum

### Merger Guidelines (2023)
- In December 2023, the FTC and DOJ released joint Merger Guidelines describing how agencies review mergers and acquisitions
- These guidelines represented "the most significant change to the guidelines in 30 years"
- **On February 18, 2025**, Chair Ferguson released a statement confirming that "the FTC's and DOJ's joint 2023 Merger Guidelines are in effect and are the framework for this agency's merger-review analysis"
- Ferguson emphasized "we should prize stability and disfavor wholesale rescission"
- Omeed Assefi (then-acting assistant attorney general for the Antitrust Division at DOJ) issued a similar memorandum to DOJ Antitrust Division staff on the same day
- Gail Slater, the new assistant attorney general for the DOJ Antitrust Division, echoed similar sentiments in her confirmation hearing

### Enforcement Priorities and Outlook
- **At the American Bar Association Antitrust Section's annual Spring Meeting**, Jordan S. Andrew (deputy assistant director of the FTC's Mergers I Division) stated the FTC will continue to focus on "rollups" — serial, nonreportable transactions that collectively result in significant acquisitions of market share
- Panel speakers at the Spring Meeting suggested enforcement overall might decrease, but industries and companies in "White House crosshairs" are likely to receive special scrutiny
- Panelists suggested there will likely be more direct discussions between agencies and the administration about enforcement targets and litigation decisions
- **In early April 2025**, at an event hosted by the Capitol Forum, Chair Ferguson stated his intention to continue lawsuits against large tech companies

### Other Enforcement Actions
- Robinson-Patman Act (RPA) lawsuits against Southern Glazer and Pepsi were filed in the last months of the Biden administration (first RPA enforcement actions since 2000)
- Commissioners Ferguson and Holyoak dissented from these cases
- As of the article's publication date, the FTC has not indicated it intends to drop these RPA lawsuits
- Judge Slaughter from the Central District of California denied Southern Glazer's motion to dismiss

### Noncompete Rule
- The FTC previously attempted to institute a rule banning most noncompete agreements nationwide
- Judge Ada Brown in the Northern District of Texas issued an August 20, 2024 order enjoining the rule from going into effect nationwide
- On March 7, 2025, the FTC filed motions to stay appeals of this rule, citing changes in the new administration and the agency's desire to reconsider the rule

## Relevance to Forecasting Question:
The article indicates that Chair Ferguson stated his intention to **continue lawsuits against large tech companies** (statement made in early April 2025 at a Capitol Forum event). However, the article does not provide specific information about new civil antitrust merger challenges filed by the DOJ against Big Tech firms, nor does it mention any specific merger challenges in progress or planned.

# Summary of "DOJ v. Visa could prove an important battleground for tech antitrust"

**Key Facts and Timeline:**

- The DOJ filed a lawsuit against Visa in **September 2024**, alleging the company monopolized the market for debit card payments, violating Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act.

- The court **rejected Visa's motion to dismiss in June** (presumably June 2025, based on article date of October 31, 2025).

- Fact discovery is not yet underway, and no trial date has been announced as of the article's publication.

- The Trump administration has continued the case initiated under the Biden administration.

**Market Statistics:**

- Visa earns approximately **$7 billion in revenue** from fees charged to consumers, banks, and merchants on its network.

- In the "general-purpose debit market," Visa processes about **60% of transactions**, with Mastercard in second place at about **25%**.

- On a $60 purchase, issuer fees and network fees average **24 cents and 14 cents**, respectively.

**Allegations:**

- The DOJ alleges Visa maintained its dominant position through exclusionary contracts and partnerships with firms like Apple and PayPal.

- The complaint cites internal Visa documents calling Apple Pay an "existential threat" when first launched; Visa subsequently partnered with Apple to enable the app to use its debit network.

- The DOJ speculates these partners would otherwise have been direct competitors to Visa.

**Remedies Sought:**

- The DOJ stops short of asking for breakups but seeks to enjoin and ban the firm from contracting practices it alleges to be illegal.

**Relevance to Big Tech Antitrust:**

- The author argues this case shares important characteristics with Big Tech antitrust cases (Google, Meta, Amazon, Apple) because Visa operates as a two-sided platform connecting different consumer groups.

- The article discusses how the case may help decide open questions about antitrust enforcement in complex multi-sided platform markets with rapid innovation.

**Note:** This article is an opinion/analysis piece from the Reason Foundation (a libertarian think tank) rather than straight news reporting. The author's perspective appears skeptical of aggressive antitrust enforcement.

**Relevance to Forecasting Question:** This case involves Visa, not one of the five Big Tech companies specified in the question (Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, Microsoft). However, it does not involve a merger challenge—it's a monopolization case. Therefore, this article does not directly contribute to the count for the forecasting question.

# Summary of Court Ruling on DOJ v. Google LLC

**Key Facts:**

1. **Case Details:**
   - Case filed: January 24, 2023
   - Case number: 1:23-cv-108 (LMB/JFA)
   - Court: United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia, Alexandria Division
   - Ruling date: April 17, 2025

2. **Parties:**
   - Plaintiffs: United States Department of Justice and 17 states (California, Colorado, Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Virginia, Arizona, Illinois, Michigan, Minnesota, Nebraska, New Hampshire, North Carolina, Washington, and West Virginia)
   - Defendant: Google LLC

3. **Nature of Case:**
   - This is an **antitrust action**, NOT a merger challenge
   - The case concerns Google's alleged monopolization of digital advertising technology markets
   - Claims brought under Section 2 of the Sherman Act (monopolization) and Sections 1 and 2 (tying)

4. **Court's Findings:**
   - Google violated Section 2 of the Sherman Act "by willfully acquiring and maintaining monopoly power" in:
     - The open-web display publisher ad server market
     - The open-web display ad exchange market
   - Google unlawfully tied its publisher ad server (DFP) and ad exchange (AdX) in violation of Sections 1 and 2 of the Sherman Act
   - Plaintiffs failed to prove a relevant market for open-web display advertiser ad networks

5. **Procedural Notes:**
   - Three-week bench trial was held
   - Google's damages claim (Count V) was dismissed as moot after Google tendered $2,289,751.00
   - Jury trial demand was struck; case proceeded as bench trial
   - Court will set a briefing schedule to determine appropriate remedies

**Important Note:** This case does NOT appear to be a merger challenge. It concerns monopolization of existing markets through Google's conduct in digital advertising technology, not a challenge to block or enjoin a proposed merger or acquisition. Therefore, this case would NOT count toward the resolution criteria for the forecasting question.

# Summary of Article: "Justice department alleges Google tried to 'eliminate' ad market rivals in lawsuit"

**Source:** The Guardian  
**Date:** January 25, 2023

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Lawsuit Details:** The US Department of Justice and eight states filed a lawsuit against Alphabet's Google on Tuesday (January 24, 2023) in federal court in Alexandria, Virginia, alleging the company abused its dominance of the digital advertising business.

2. **States Involved:** Eight states joined the lawsuit: California, Virginia, Connecticut, Colorado, New Jersey, New York, Rhode Island, and Tennessee.

3. **DOJ's Request:** The Department asked the court to compel Google to divest its Google Ad Manager suite, including its ad exchange AdX.

4. **Google's Market Position:**
   - Google held nearly 29% of the US digital advertising market in 2022 (according to Insider Intelligence)
   - Meta held nearly 20% (second place)
   - Amazon held more than 11% (third place)
   - Digital ads account for about 80% of Google's revenue

5. **Historical Context:** This is the second federal antitrust complaint filed against Google. The first DOJ lawsuit filed in 2020 focuses on Google's monopoly in search and is scheduled to go to trial in September (2023).

6. **Market Impact:** Google shares were down 1.3% on the news.

7. **Specific Acquisition Mentioned:** The suit references Google's 2008 acquisition of DoubleClick, a dominant ad server.

## Opinions from Named/Reliable Sources:

- **Attorney General Merrick Garland:** Stated that "for 15 years, Google has pursued a course of anti-competitive conduct" and that "Google has engaged in exclusionary conduct" that has "severely weakened", if not destroyed, competition in the ad tech industry.

- **Dina Srinivasan (Yale University fellow and adtech expert):** Called the lawsuit "huge" because it aligns the entire nation in a bipartisan legal offensive against Google. She described the current online ad market as "broken and totally inefficient" and called the 30-50% intermediary take "an insane inefficiency" and "a massive tax on the free internet and consumers at large."

- **Alphabet Inc (Google's parent company):** Said in a statement that the suit "doubles down on a flawed argument that would slow innovation, raise advertising fees, and make it harder for thousands of small businesses and publishers to grow."

## Additional Context:

- The lawsuit alleges Google controls three key aspects: technology used by major website publishers, the leading tool used by advertisers, and the largest ad exchange matching publishers and advertisers.
- Market trends: Insider Intelligence estimates both Google and Meta's market share will decline, while rivals like Amazon and TikTok are expected to see gains.
- International context: The EU launched an antitrust investigation into Google's digital ad dominance in 2021, and British and European regulators are investigating an agreement between Google and Meta.

**Note:** This lawsuit concerns Google's advertising business practices, not a merger challenge, so it does not directly count toward the forecasting question about DOJ civil antitrust merger challenges.

</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: , Amazon, Apple, Meta (Facebook), or Microsoft, including filing dates and courts.
Objective.  The forecasting question asks how many civil antitrust merger complaints the Antitrust Division of the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) will file in federal district court against any of the five “Big Tech” companies — Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, or Microsoft — from question-open through 30 April 2026.  To establish a baseline we searched the DOJ Antitrust Case-Filings database as well as contemporaneous press and legal commentary for any merger-challenge complaints already on file or announced since the beginning of 2023 (roughly when the forecasting tournament’s questions opened).

1. Results of the document search  
   • Apple.  On 21 March 2024 the DOJ and 16 states filed United States et al. v. Apple Inc. in the District of New Jersey (No. 2:24-cv-04055) (Justice.gov, March 21 2024).  The complaint is a monopolisation (Sherman Act § 2) case; it does not challenge a merger or acquisition.  
   • Amazon.  The only recent federal competition suit is the FTC/state complaint filed 26 September 2023 in W.D. Washington (FTC press release, Sept 26 2023).  It is an FTC monopolisation action, not a DOJ merger case.  
   • Meta (Facebook).  The pending federal case over Instagram and WhatsApp is FTC v. Meta, brought by the FTC, not the DOJ, and it attacks consummated acquisitions rather than a new prospective merger (BBC, Apr 14 2025; The Verge, Apr 11 2025).  
   • Microsoft.  No post-2023 DOJ civil complaint seeks to block a Microsoft deal.  (The FTC handled the high-profile Activision-Blizzard matter, and the 1998 DOJ action against Microsoft was a conduct case, not a merger.)  
   • Alphabet/Google.  The DOJ’s 2020 search-monopoly and 2023 ad-tech suits are Sherman-Act conduct cases, not merger challenges; the last time DOJ tried to block a Google acquisition was the 2011 investigation of ITA Software, which ended in a consent decree, not litigation.

   None of the documents located in the DOJ case-filings index that list any of the five firms since 1 January 2023 is titled “Complaint—Merger” or describes relief “to enjoin the acquisition of …”.

2. Cross-check against secondary commentary  
   2024–2025 year-in-review memoranda by Goodwin Procter (Insights, “Antitrust & Competition Technology Year in Review 2024”) and Arnold & Porter (“Antitrust Agency Insights Q1-2025”) catalogue every significant DOJ merger action during those periods; none involves the five Big-Tech companies.  Both memoranda note that large-platform matters have, to date, been pursued either by the FTC (Amazon, Meta, Microsoft/Activision) or by the DOJ as conduct, not merger, cases (Google Search, Google Ad-Tech, Apple iPhone).  This corroborates the database finding that the DOJ has not filed a civil merger-blocking complaint against any of the five firms since at least the beginning of 2023.

3. Conclusion to date  
   • Number of qualifying DOJ civil merger complaints filed against Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, or Microsoft after the question opened and up to mid-June 2026: 0.  
   • Therefore the current observed value for the forecast target is zero.

4. Remaining information gaps  
   • Although the database and secondary materials strongly indicate there have been no qualifying cases, the DOJ’s public “Antitrust Case Filings” pages can lag by days or weeks.  A final verification run immediately before close-of-question (30 April 2026) will still be required.  
   • HSR-review activity that ends in a negotiated abandonment or a consent decree without the filing of a federal-court complaint does not meet the resolution criteria; however, monitoring such investigations (e.g., Microsoft/Inflection AI, Amazon/iRobot) may provide early warning of any future complaint.  Press releases from the Antitrust Division and PACER docket alerts for the five companies’ names combined with “United States of America” should therefore be watched.

5. Assessment going forward  
   • The Trump Administration’s enforcement leadership (Assistant AG Gail Slater) has publicly stated that “Big Tech” remains a priority but that the Division prefers case-by-case enforcement over sector-specific rule-making (Nixon Peabody alert, May 5 2025).  That stance leaves open the possibility of merger complaints should any of the five firms announce significant acquisitions that could be framed as entrenching dominance.  
   • At the same time, most platform-merger oversight in recent years has been handled by the FTC rather than DOJ; unless jurisdictional allocation between the agencies changes, the DOJ is statistically less likely than the FTC to bring such a suit.

In sum, based on all publicly available sources reviewed, no DOJ civil merger-blocking lawsuit has been filed against Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, or Microsoft since the question’s start date, and no such action is currently pending.  The live count for the forecasting question is therefore zero.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
