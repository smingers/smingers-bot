Disagreement Analysis:

The forecasters are remarkably aligned on the core prediction: the most likely outcome is 0 DOJ civil antitrust merger challenges against Big Tech firms in this 75-day window. However, there are meaningful disagreements in the tails and in how they express uncertainty:

1. **Probability mass assigned to ≥1 filing (tail risk sizing)**: Forecaster 1 and 5 both place P90 at 2.0, while forecaster 2 places P90 at 1.5 and forecaster 3 places P90 at 1.0. More importantly, forecasters 4 and 5 spread probability mass across the P40-P80 range (e.g., P60 of 0.2 and 0.4 respectively), while forecasters 1, 2, and 3 keep P60 at essentially 0. This reflects different estimates of the probability of at least one filing: forecasters 1-3 estimate roughly 5-10%, while forecasters 4-5 estimate 15-20%.

2. **Whether any Big Tech merger is currently in the DOJ pipeline or could emerge quickly enough**: All forecasters note no publicly known Big Tech deals under DOJ review, but they differ on how likely a "surprise" scenario is. Forecaster 5 specifically cites the ATT/T-Mobile precedent (DOJ sued 17 days after deal announcement) as evidence that rapid filing is possible, pushing their tail estimates higher. Forecasters 1-3 treat the empty pipeline as more definitively constraining.

3. **Impact of DOJ leadership transition on filing probability**: All note Gail Slater's resignation around Feb 12-13, 2026, but they weight it differently. Forecasters 1 and 2 treat the leadership vacuum as a strong additional reason to push probability toward zero. Forecasters 4 and 5 acknowledge it but give it less weight, noting that career staff could still file if a deal warranted it.

Root Causes:

1. **Tail risk sizing (P(≥1))**: This is primarily a **different weighting of the same evidence**. All forecasters see the same empty pipeline and short window but assign different probabilities to surprise scenarios. Partially factual — whether any Big Tech M&A deals are currently rumored or under quiet review could resolve this.

2. **Pipeline status**: This is a **verifiable factual question**. If there are any pending or rumored Big Tech acquisitions that could trigger DOJ review, it would materially affect the forecast. The disagreement stems from different assumptions about what might be happening behind closed doors.

3. **Leadership transition impact**: This is partly **factual** (what is the current status of DOJ Antitrust Division leadership as of Feb 15, 2026?) and partly **judgment-based** (how much does acting leadership reduce filing probability?).
