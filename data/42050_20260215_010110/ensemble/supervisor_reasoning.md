Resolution of Disagreements:

1. **Pipeline status (factual, resolved)**: The targeted research confirms that as of February 15, 2026, **zero** DOJ merger complaints have been filed against any of the five Big Tech firms. The agent report found only two potentially reviewable 2026 acquisitions: Apple's $2B acquisition of Q.ai (announced Feb 5, 2026) and Microsoft's acquisition of Osmos (announced Jan 6, 2026, undisclosed terms). Neither Amazon, Meta, nor Alphabet have announced significant acquisitions in early 2026. This supports the more conservative forecasters (1-3) who treated the empty pipeline as strongly constraining. The Apple/Q.ai deal is the only clearly HSR-reportable transaction, but at $2B it is relatively small and there's no indication of DOJ concern.

2. **DOJ leadership transition (factual, resolved)**: Research confirms Gail Slater resigned/was forced out on Feb 12-13, 2026. Omeed Assefi is acting head. Additionally, the head of civil litigation also departed the same week, leaving the division with "few senior leaders." This is even more disruptive than some forecasters assumed — not just a leadership vacuum but a broader exodus of senior staff. This strongly supports forecasters 1-2 who weighted the leadership vacuum heavily as reducing filing probability.

3. **Regulatory environment (factual, resolved)**: Multiple sources confirm the Trump DOJ is more merger-friendly. The HPE-Juniper case was settled (not blocked) after political interference overruled the Antitrust Division. Lobbyists successfully influenced DOJ decisions. The "America First Antitrust" doctrine views corporate scale as a national security asset. This further reduces the probability of a Big Tech merger challenge.

4. **Tail risk sizing (partially resolved)**: The surprise scenario (a major Big Tech deal already under quiet review) is now less likely given the agent report found no significant pending deals. The Apple/Q.ai deal at $2B is the only candidate, but it's small relative to the companies involved and unlikely to trigger a challenge. The PwC report suggests Big Tech firms are focused on capex for AI infrastructure rather than M&A, further reducing the pipeline of potential challenge targets.

Updated Analysis:

The research strongly supports the view that the probability of any DOJ merger challenge against Big Tech in this 75-day window is very low — likely in the 3-8% range rather than the 15-20% range suggested by forecasters 4-5. Key factors:

- Zero current filings, zero historical precedent
- Leadership vacuum is even worse than initially assessed (multiple senior departures)
- Only one small ($2B) Big Tech acquisition in the pipeline (Apple/Q.ai)
- Merger-friendly political environment with documented political interference favoring deal approval
- Big Tech focused on capex, not M&A
- 75-day window is very short

The weighted average currently has P80 around 0.9 and P90 around 0.95, which seems reasonable but perhaps slightly too high given the research findings. The research supports pulling the distribution slightly toward the more conservative forecasters (1-3). I'll adjust the upper percentiles down modestly.
