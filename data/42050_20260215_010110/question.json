It serves as a metric for the intensity of antitrust enforcement in the digital sector.\r\n\r\n`{\"format\":\"bot_tournament_question\",\"info\":{\"hash_id\":\"5e78c219fb889935\",\"sheet_id\":54.1}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves to the total number of unique civil lawsuits filed by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) Antitrust Division in a U.S. District Court to block or enjoin a merger or acquisition where the acquiring or target firm is one of the following 'Big Tech' entities: Alphabet Inc., Amazon.com Inc., Apple Inc., Meta Platforms Inc., or Microsoft Corp. (including their majority-owned subsidiaries). To be counted, the filing date of the initial complaint must be after this question opens and before May 1, 2026. The primary source for resolution is the DOJ Antitrust Case Filings database (https://www.justice.gov/atr/antitrust-case-filings).",
    "fine_print": "A single lawsuit challenging a single transaction counts as one, even if multiple 'Big Tech' firms are named as defendants. Amended complaints in existing cases filed before this question opens do not count. If the DOJ files a 'Proposed Final Judgment' or 'Consent Decree' simultaneously with a complaint to settle a challenge, it still counts as a filed challenge. If the DOJ website is not updated by the resolution date, credible news reports may be used to confirm the filing date and parties involved. If no such lawsuits are filed, the question resolves to 0.",
