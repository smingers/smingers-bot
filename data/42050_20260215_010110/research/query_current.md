Analysis:
The question focuses on whether, in the ~2½-month window from 15 Feb 2026 to 1 May 2026, the DOJ Antitrust Division will sue in U.S. District Court to block mergers involving Alphabet, Amazon, Apple, Meta, or Microsoft.  To gauge that likelihood we need current information on:
• Any sizeable or controversial acquisitions these firms have announced that are still awaiting U.S. antitrust clearance.  
• Signs the DOJ is conducting a “second request,” in-depth investigation, or is preparing litigation on such deals.  
• Broader DOJ enforcement signals (policy speeches, leaks to press).  
Therefore we should look for late-2025/early-2026 press coverage on pending tech mergers, DOJ probes, and merger-challenge rumors.
