IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-15. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-15 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

The lower bound is -0.5 and the upper bound is 10.5.
The lower bound is CLOSED (outcome cannot be below -0.5), but the upper bound is OPEN (outcome can exceed 10.5). Your upper percentiles may extend beyond the upper bound if evidence supports it.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic or financial data, add a FRED query. Use a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate") or a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE"). Returns historical data with computed statistics.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one Agent query.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant historical context needed to generate an outside view.}

Search queries:
1. your query here (Google)
2. your query here (Google News)
3. your query here (Agent)
4. economic indicator query (FRED) -- only if question involves economic/financial data
