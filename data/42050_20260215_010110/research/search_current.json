The rule, which became effective on February 10, 2025, required merging parties to submit significantly more documents and information to the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice. The court ruled the new rules were 'arbitrary and capricious' under the Administrative Procedure Act and exceeded the FTC's statutory authority because the agency failed to demonstrate that the additional data was 'necessary and appropriate' for assessing whether a proposed acquisition would violate antitrust laws. The court\u2019s order is stayed for seven days to allow the FTC to seek emergency relief from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, which may extend the stay until the case is resolved on the merits. If the order takes effect, the new HSR rules will be nullified, and merging parties will revert to using the prior, simpler HSR form. This change affects only the volume of information required in filings\u2014not which transactions must be reported under the HSR Act.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 08:26 PM\nSource:[The National Law Review - A Free To Use Nationwide Database of Legal Publications](https://natlawreview.com/article/federal-court-vacates-ftcs-new-hsr-rules)\n\n**DOJ's Antitrust Chief Resigns Amid Accusations of Corruption Among Top Officials**\nGail Slater, Assistant Attorney General of the Justice Department's (DOJ) Antitrust Division, resigned on February 13, 2026, amid escalating conflicts with Attorney General Pam Bondi and allegations of corruption among top DOJ officials. Her resignation followed disagreements over the enforcement of antitrust policy, particularly regarding the $14 billion merger between Hewlett Packard (H.P.) and Juniper Networks\u2014two of the largest providers of enterprise-grade wireless networking solutions in the U.S. Although Slater was not yet confirmed by the Senate at the time, she played a key role in the DOJ\u2019s decision to sue to block the merger. Acting Assistant Attorney General Omeed Assefi warned the merger would lead Americans to 'pay more for less' from wireless technology providers. Slater reportedly told Bondi that intelligence agencies had no national security concerns, but CIA Director John Ratcliffe later revealed he had raised such concerns and felt excluded from the decision-making process. This discrepancy led Bondi to believe Slater had misled her, prompting the DOJ to drop the lawsuit in June 2025 and fire Slater\u2019s top deputy, Roger Alford, and William Rinner, head of merger enforcement. Alford, despite being fired, launched a public campaign against lobbyists, accusing them of influencing DOJ officials and undermining 'genuine MAGA reformers' like Slater. In speeches and testimony before the House Judiciary Subcommittee, Alford alleged that Chad Mizelle, Bondi\u2019s chief of staff, and Associate Attorney General Stanley Woodward 'perverted justice' and acted inconsistently with the rule of law. He cited lobbyist Trey Gowdy\u2019s golf meeting with President Donald Trump as evidence of political interference, noting Trump\u2019s subsequent pardon of Tim Leiweke\u2014former CEO of Oak View Group and Gowdy\u2019s client\u2014after Leiweke was indicted by the DOJ\u2019s Antitrust Division. Alford also pointed to Trump\u2019s involvement in the Netflix-Warner Bros. Discovery (WBD) merger, where Trump, influenced by rival bidder Paramount Skydance (owned by Trump supporter Larry Ellison), initially threatened to block the deal before reversing course. Despite her commitment to her 'America First Antitrust Policy' inspired by New Right intellectuals Oren Cass and Sohrab Ahmari, Slater ultimately resigned after being offered the choice between resignation and termination. Bondi publicly thanked Slater for her service, while Mizelle urged DOJ staff to 'put aside personal agendas' to serve the President\u2019s priorities. Mike Davis, a Washington-based lawyer accused by Alford of influencing Mizelle, called Slater\u2019s departure 'good riddance.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 04:23 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/dojs-antitrust-chief-resigns-amid-162324134.html)\n\n**In Landmark Social Media Trial, Big Tech Faces the Big Tobacco Playbook | Analysis**\nA landmark civil trial in Los Angeles is testing whether tech giants Meta (parent of Instagram) and YouTube deliberately designed their platforms to addict young users, causing mental health harm such as anxiety, depression, and body dysmorphia. The case, brought by a 20-year-old California woman known as Kaley G.M., uses a legal strategy modeled on the 1990s Big Tobacco lawsuits, arguing that companies knowingly exploited psychological vulnerabilities in youth. Plaintiff's attorney Mark Lanier compared Instagram and YouTube to 'digital casinos' and claimed they built 'traps' to keep users hooked, citing internal company documents showing executives prioritized growth over safety\u2014such as a 2018 Meta memo stating, 'If we want to win big with teens, we must bring them in as tweens.' Meta and YouTube deny causation, with Meta's lawyer Paul Schmidt presenting evidence that the plaintiff faced severe trauma before using social media, including abuse and early therapy. YouTube\u2019s lawyer Luis Li argued the platform is for entertainment, like Netflix, and that the plaintiff used YouTube for only about a minute per day on Shorts\u2014features alleged to be addictive. The trial is the first of nine scheduled in California state court and challenges the scope of Section 230 of the Communications Decency Act, which protects platforms from liability for user content but may not shield them from claims about harmful product design. Meanwhile, New Mexico\u2019s attorney general Ra\u00fal Torrez has launched a separate trial alleging Meta failed to protect minors from sexual exploitation, using undercover investigations to document solicitations. Torrez asserts that Section 230 does not protect companies from liability for deceptive safety claims or dangerous design choices. Legal experts like Kate Klonick of St. John's University note that a jury verdict could set a precedent for future cases, potentially reshaping tech accountability. Meta\u2019s CEO Mark Zuckerberg is expected to testify on February 18, 2026, while the outcome may influence global regulation and public trust in Big Tech. The case is being watched as a pivotal moment in the 'reckoning' of Big Tech, with parallels to historical accountability cases against tobacco and pharmaceutical industries.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 02:00 PM\nSource:[TheWrap](https://www.thewrap.com/media-platforms/journalism/meta-youtube-social-media-trial/)\n\n**Gail Slater, Ousted DOJ Antitrust Chief, Was Reviewing Netflix-Warner Bros.

In a post on X, Slater expressed 'great sadness and abiding hope' about leaving the position, calling it 'the honor of a lifetime' and thanking the staff of the Antitrust Division. She has a background in tech and media law, and her tenure was marked by scrutiny over the Trump administration\u2019s approach to antitrust enforcement and high-profile mergers. Notably, she was reviewing Netflix\u2019s proposed acquisition of Warner Bros. Discovery at the time of her departure. President Donald Trump had previously stated he would personally oversee the merger review, and the DOJ confirmed Slater\u2019s resignation while the White House remained silent on the matter.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 01:37 PM\nSource:[breitbart.com](https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2026/02/12/gail-slater-ousted-doj-antitrust-chief-was-reviewing-netflix-warner-bros-merger/)\n\n**Exclusive | Business groups urge Trump to double down on 'muscular antitrust...**\nA coalition of prominent business groups, including Y Combinator, News Media Alliance, Beeper, DuckDuckGo, the National Grocers Association, and over two dozen small business and regional food industry trade groups, has urged President Trump to strengthen his 'muscular antitrust policy' to lower prices for Americans. The call came after Justice Department antitrust chief Gail Slater resigned on February 13, 2026, following internal clashes with agency leadership over high-profile antitrust enforcement, including cases against Live Nation/Ticketmaster, Visa, Apple, and Google. The letter, obtained by The New York Post, argues that market consolidation and abuse of power have inflated prices across sectors: tech platforms impose coercive terms on sellers and advertisers; dominant grocery retailers block smaller rivals and charge high prices; monopolistic agriculture farms undermine independent farmers; and healthcare consolidation has driven up premiums, out-of-pocket costs, and drug prices. The groups emphasized that antitrust enforcement is not about punishing success but ensuring open markets and fair competition. Notable conservative signatories included Joel Thayer (Digital Progress Institute), Aiden Buzzetti (The Bull Moose Project), and Rachel Bovard (Conservative Partnership Institute). The letter urged the administration to advance strong enforcement in 2026, particularly in sectors affecting everyday essentials. Slater\u2019s departure, confirmed by sources as a White House decision, followed her opposition to settling the Hewlett Packard-Juniper Networks deal and her resistance to a lenient remedy in the Google search case. Omeed Assefi will serve as acting antitrust chief. While some sources claim Slater was sidelined due to conflicts with Attorney General Pam Bondi, others suggest she lost influence through repeated clashes. The DOJ is also preparing to appeal a judge\u2019s decision in the Google case, reflecting ongoing tension between populist conservatives favoring aggressive enforcement and traditional Republicans advocating a more deal-friendly approach.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 11:00 AM\nSource:[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2026/02/13/business/business-groups-urge-trump-to-double-down-on-muscular-antitrust-policy-to-bring-down-prices/)\n\n**The EU's Bold Bet on One Market: A Risky New Era of Economic Integration**\nThe European Union is accelerating toward the creation of an 'One Market'\u2014a fully integrated economic ecosystem\u2014following the informal summit in Bilzen, Belgium, where leaders, including President of the European Council Ant\u00f3nio Costa, emphasized the need to overcome national barriers in strategic sectors such as finance, energy, and telecommunications. The shift from the 1992 single market model to a unified continental framework by 2026\u20132027 aims to eliminate regulatory fragmentation and foster economic cohesion. Former Italian Prime Ministers Mario Draghi and Enrico Letta pushed for rapid normative simplification and proposed the creation of European Commission-managed capital funds to directly invest in strategic industries, transforming the EU from a regulator into an active economic player. The EU is also considering revising antitrust rules to allow large-scale mergers and acquisitions to compete with U.S. and Chinese tech giants. France, led by President Emmanuel Macron, demands tangible progress by June 2026 on capital market union to mobilize private savings for green and technological transitions, threatening to use enhanced cooperation if consensus fails. Germany remains opposed to joint debt issuance, deepening the divide between Paris and Berlin. Energy pricing remains a critical challenge, with EU industrial competitiveness undermined by high energy costs despite the Emissions Trading System (ETS) reducing emissions by 39% over 20 years. A proposed 28th European corporate legal framework aims to enable companies to operate with a unified European legal identity, streamlining cross-border business.

Her departure comes amid internal turmoil, with reports of White House-aligned lobbyists interfering in enforcement cases and weakening antitrust actions. Slater, appointed by President Trump in 2025, left just as her division was approaching a critical phase in a major antitrust case against Live Nation Entertainment, which seeks to force the company to divest its Ticketmaster ticketing division. The case, initiated under the Biden administration in May 2024, alleges that Live Nation created an illegal monopoly through exclusive venue contracts and retaliated against competitors. According to Semafor, Live Nation executives and lobbyists bypassed Slater to negotiate directly with senior DOJ officials, effectively sidelining the antitrust division. In another case, a real estate brokerage merger was approved despite Slater\u2019s opposition, raising concerns of a 'pay-for-play' system. Additionally, her team\u2019s attempt to block Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2019s $14 billion acquisition of Juniper Networks was overruled after direct lobbying by Trump-connected figures. Two of her deputies were dismissed for refusing to accept a settlement on grounds of insubordination. Similar concerns emerged in the Warner Bros. Discovery merger battle, where Netflix offered an $83 billion deal and Paramount Skydance, backed by Trump ally Larry Ellison, proposed a $108 billion hostile takeover.

Slater, who had been confirmed by the Senate with bipartisan support (78-19), announced her departure on X, expressing 'great sadness and abiding hope' and calling her service an 'honor of a lifetime.' Multiple sources indicated she was perceived as too lax on affordability issues, particularly in the DOJ's slow-moving investigation into meatpacking cartels\u2014prompted by Trump\u2019s November 2025 accusation that 'foreign-owned meat packing cartels' were inflating beef prices. A major point of contention was her opposition to a DOJ settlement blocking the Hewlett Packard Enterprise\u2013Juniper Networks merger, which Attorney General Pam Bondi and national security officials overruled, fracturing leadership relations and leading to the ouster of two of Slater\u2019s deputies. Additional internal disputes included her unauthorized social media announcement of her chief of staff\u2019s departure and her travel to Paris despite leadership objections. While Slater publicly emphasized that housing, transportation, and food costs were 'at front of mind' and that her division was working to lower costs for families, sources described her as unwilling to coordinate with leadership and insufficiently committed to Trump\u2019s goals of 'economic prosperity and affordability.' Her allies, including former No. 2 Roger Alford, defended her as committed to Trump\u2019s populist message and resisting 'MAGA-in-name-only' lobbyists. However, her engagement with Robert Barnes, a prominent anti-Trump lawyer, and her reliance on Luther Lowe\u2014a former Democratic lobbyist who donated $150,000 to Democrats\u2014raised further concerns. The antitrust division, now led by acting chief Omeed Aseffi, oversees high-profile cases involving Google, Apple, and Meta, and reviews major corporate mergers. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Senator Amy Klobuchar both expressed regret over her departure, with Klobuchar calling it a 'major loss' and noting Slater\u2019s role in securing a landmark victory against Google.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 01:53 AM\nSource:[Fox Business](https://www.foxbusiness.com/politics/inside-trumps-removal-doj-antitrust-chief-gail-slater)\n\n**One year into Trump 2.0, enforcement agenda of U.S. antitrust agencies continues to evolve**\nOne year into the second Trump administration (Trump 2.0), the U.S. antitrust enforcement landscape has evolved significantly under Republican leadership at the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and Department of Justice Antitrust Division (DOJ). The agencies have adopted a more favorable stance toward mergers, embracing both structural (e.g., divestitures) and behavioral remedies, a shift from the Biden administration\u2019s tendency to block deals. In March 2025, the FTC challenged the $627 million GTCR-Surmodics merger but lost in court, reinforcing the agencies\u2019 preference for settlements. The FTC also set aside two Biden-era consent agreements, citing insufficient antitrust allegations. DOJ merger decisions have faced scrutiny, with allegations of political influence, including in a June 2025 settlement and the July 2025 dismissal of a $570 million merger complaint, prompting bipartisan criticism and a Tunney Act proceeding with potential evidentiary hearings. HSR Act enforcement remains strict, with new filing requirements in place and the DOJ creating a 'Comply with Care' task force to address noncompliance, including a $1.1 million penalty and a $650 million potential penalty in a case involving private equity firms. State-level premerger notification laws have expanded, with Washington and Colorado enacting 'mini HSR Acts' based on the UAPNA model, and New York proposing broader legislation. The FTC and DOJ have used antitrust laws to target perceived conservative viewpoint censorship and DEI initiatives, launching inquiries into tech platforms and advertising collusion, and creating a Joint Labor Task Force to investigate DEI metrics. The FTC also challenged the Clean Truck Partnership (CTP), a climate initiative, calling it anti-competitive, and secured commitments to end it. Deregulation efforts have intensified, with the DOJ launching an Anticompetitive Regulations Task Force and the FTC identifying over 125 regulations deemed anticompetitive. The FTC withdrew the Biden-era noncompete rule, opting for case-by-case enforcement, while issuing warning letters and settling with a pet cremation service. A new DOJ Whistleblower Rewards Program offers up to 30% of criminal fines to informants. DOJ secured its first jury conviction in a criminal wage-fixing case involving home health care nurses. President Trump pardoned a CEO indicted for bid-rigging in university arena projects. In AI, the administration issued an Executive Order to preempt state AI laws and establish a national framework, with the FTC monitoring competition in AI inputs and labor markets, while Commissioner Meador warned of 'acqui-hires' undermining innovation. DOJ is also preparing for trial in its monopolization case against Live Nation and Ticketmaster in March 2026, and has issued a second request on the Netflix-WBD merger. The FTC continues its 6(b) study on pharmacy benefit managers, with a final report pending. The agencies are expected to maintain focus on AI, entertainment, health care, and agriculture sectors.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 07:59 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/one-year-into-trump-2-0-enforcement-8374297/)\n\n**Antitrust M&A Enforcement Update: FTC Kicks Off 2026 by Increasing HSR Thresholds and Blocking a Medical Device Merger**\nThe Federal Trade Commission (FTC) announced the 2026 annual adjustment to the Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) Antitrust Improvements Act thresholds, increasing the size-of-transaction threshold from $126.4 million to $133.9 million. This adjustment applies to transactions consummated on or after 30 days following the FTC's publication in the Federal Register. Under the new thresholds, transactions involving voting securities, non-corporate interests, or assets valued at or above the revised threshold must be reported to the FTC and the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ), unless an exemption applies. Parties must file HSR premerger notifications, pay the applicable filing fee, and wait for the 30-day waiting period to expire or be terminated before closing. Failure to file may result in monetary penalties. The revised filing fees are tied to transaction value. On January 12, 2026, a federal district court granted the FTC\u2019s request to temporarily block Edwards Lifesciences Corp.'s proposed acquisition of JenaValve Technology, Inc., a medical device merger the FTC had challenged in August 2025. The FTC argued the deal would reduce competition, hinder innovation and quality, and potentially raise prices for transcatheter aortic valve replacement devices in the U.S. The parties ultimately abandoned the transaction.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 07:27 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/antitrust-m-a-enforcement-update-ftc-7004005/)\n\n**2026 Antitrust Year in Preview: Big Tech**\nThe 2026 antitrust preview for Big Tech highlights intensified regulatory scrutiny of digital technology firms in the U.S., Europe, and the UK. In the U.S., the Trump administration's DOJ pursued aggressive remedies in the Google search distribution case, including structural divestitures and data-sharing mandates, but a court rejected major requests, citing Google\u2019s lawful innovation and investment. The court upheld limited restrictions on contracts and required Google to share certain data with rivals, extending the remedy to qualified generative AI firms due to the evolving competitive landscape. In the Meta case, the FTC lost its long-running challenge to the WhatsApp and Instagram acquisitions, as the court found that Meta lacked monopoly power at trial due to rapid market changes, including competition from TikTok and YouTube. The FTC and several states sued Amazon in April 2025, alleging price manipulation via the 'Nessie' algorithm and preferential treatment of its own products. The DOJ advanced a broad antitrust probe into Microsoft\u2019s cloud, AI, and software businesses, while a suit against Apple over cross-platform restrictions survived a motion to dismiss. The Trump administration also signaled interest in using antitrust laws to address alleged ideological bias in tech platforms, with the FTC and DOJ launching inquiries into 'Tech Censorship' and issuing Executive Orders targeting 'woke' AI. State and federal enforcers remain in conflict, exemplified by a state challenge to the DOJ\u2019s HPE/Juniper merger settlement, which was reached without state consent. In Europe, the European Commission (EC) fined Google \u20ac2.95 billion in September 2025 for favoring its own adtech services and opened formal investigations into Google\u2019s use of publisher content for AI Overviews and YouTube content for AI training. The EC also initiated two market investigations into cloud computing under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), assessing whether Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure should be designated as gatekeepers. The EC revoked Meta\u2019s Facebook Marketplace designation under the DMA and imposed first-ever fines under the DMA: \u20ac500 million on Apple for breaching anti-steering rules and \u20ac200 million on Meta for failing to offer privacy-preserving alternatives. In the UK, the Digital Markets, Competition, and Consumers (DMCC) Act took effect in 2025, and the CMA designated Google, Apple, and Google again for mobile platforms under Strategic Market Status (SMS), with conduct requirements under review. European authorities continue to deploy both traditional antitrust tools and new digital regulations, signaling sustained enforcement momentum.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 04:18 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/2026-antitrust-year-in-preview-big-tech-5925037/)\n\n**On The Continuing Relevance Of State Antitrust Enforcement In The US**\nState antitrust enforcement in the United States has rebounded since its low point in 2021 and 2022, with states filing five single-state actions and joining federal agencies in nine additional matters by 2025. This marks a recovery from 2021 (four actions) and 2022 (six actions), though activity remains below the 2019 peak of 14 actions. The National Association of Attorneys General (NAAG) maintains a dedicated website tracking state antitrust enforcement, highlighting the states' long-standing role in protecting consumers. State enforcement spans traditional areas such as monopolization, merger reviews, bid-rigging, price manipulation, pay-for-delay, and anti-poaching agreements, with recent cases targeting ESG-related business practices, including coal investments, clean air compliance in truck manufacturing, and proxy advisory recommendations. States often focus on local issues\u2014such as regional healthcare provider consolidations or public construction bid-rigging\u2014while joining federal agencies on national matters like airline mergers, tech sector monopolization, and large health insurer combinations. A notable example is the 45-state, four-territory lawsuit against 36 pharmaceutical companies over generic dermatological drug pricing, which has survived summary judgment. Two key developments have elevated state antitrust activity: the adoption of the Uniform Antitrust Pre-Merger Notification Act (UAPNA) by Colorado (effective August 6, 2025) and Washington (effective July 27, 2025), which grants states timely access to Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) premerger filings, and California\u2019s passage of a groundbreaking law (effective January 1, 2026) that prohibits the use of 'common pricing algorithms'\u2014defined as any technology using competitor data to influence prices\u2014across sectors. The law\u2019s vagueness remains unresolved, particularly regarding whether public data alone triggers liability. Federal precedent, such as the DOJ\u2019s settlement with RealPage, Inc., indicates that using non-public competitor data violates antitrust rules, but the use of public data via shared software remains legally uncertain, as affirmed in the Ninth Circuit\u2019s Gibson v. Cendyn Group, LLC ruling. The states continue to expand their antitrust capacity, with growing staffing in antitrust divisions. Practitioners are advised to consider state enforcement risks, especially in regionally impactful transactions or those involving AI-driven pricing. The UAPNA and California\u2019s law signal a sustained and evolving state role in antitrust enforcement, demonstrating that state involvement remains robust and increasingly proactive.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 09, 2026 05:13 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/on-the-continuing-relevance-of-state-7867809/)\n\n**Missed timing undermines Big Tech competition**\nA US federal judge ruled in late November 2024 that Meta does not maintain an illegal monopoly in social media, citing the rise of competitors like TikTok, YouTube, and Snapchat as evidence of competitive markets. The decision, however, has been criticized for relying on current market conditions to assess past mergers\u2014specifically Meta\u2019s 2012 acquisition of Instagram and 2014 purchase of WhatsApp\u2014when both were clear competitive threats. Internal Meta documents revealed the company viewed Instagram as an existential threat and sought to copy, acquire, or neutralize rivals. The court\u2019s reasoning, which downplayed Meta\u2019s earlier dominance by emphasizing TikTok\u2019s success, is flawed because ByteDance, TikTok\u2019s parent company, spent heavily on user acquisition, including buying ads on Facebook and Instagram, undermining claims of organic competition. Legal scholars argue that antitrust enforcement in dynamic markets like tech must shift from reactive litigation to preventive action. The same issue arose in the Google antitrust trial, where AI chatbots were cited as a market disruptor, softening proposed remedies. Historically, the Microsoft case of the 1990s succeeded not by restoring competition in operating systems but by preventing monopolistic extensions into browsers and apps. The article emphasizes that early intervention\u2014blocking mergers before they occur\u2014is more effective than challenging consummated deals, which are nearly impossible to unwind. While the FTC and DOJ under President Joe Biden began strengthening preventive tools, the shift under Donald Trump\u2019s second administration has reversed course, with reduced scrutiny of AI mergers and a revived narrative that tech firms are national security assets. The European Union and UK also possess preventive powers, and early investigations\u2014such as those into Nvidia-Arm and Visa-Plaid\u2014have already led to deal withdrawals. However, the global push to attract AI investment has weakened enforcement, creating a collective-action problem. The Meta ruling, though seemingly minor, underscores a systemic failure: antitrust authorities must act early to prevent monopolies, not after they are entrenched. According to Madhavi Singh, Deputy Director of the Thurman Arnold Project and a fellow at Yale Law School, regulators now have stronger guidelines and digital market understanding but lack the political will to act decisively.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 17, 2025 06:01 PM\nSource:[Bangkok Post](https://www.bangkokpost.com/opinion/opinion/3158795/missed-timing-undermines-big-tech-competition)\n\n**13 State Attorneys General File Motion To Intervene In Federal Review Of DOJ's Settlement Allowing $14 Billion Merger**\nOn October 14, 2025, 13 state attorneys general\u2014including those from California, New York, Massachusetts, and Illinois\u2014filed a motion to intervene in the Tunney Act review of the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) consent decree allowing the $14 billion merger between Hewlett Packard Enterprise (HPE) and Juniper Networks. The DOJ initially sued to block the merger on January 30, 2025, alleging it would reduce competition in the enterprise-grade wireless local-area-network (WLAN) market, leading to higher prices and less innovation. The merger was settled on June 28, 2025, just days before trial, with HPE agreeing to divest its 'Instant On' WLAN business and license Juniper\u2019s key software to competitors. The settlement sparked controversy due to public reports of lobbying efforts to influence the Trump administration and the firing of two Antitrust Division attorneys. The 13 states argue the process lacked transparency, that political influence may have tainted the review, and that the settlement\u2019s terms are 'facially inadequate' and fail to address the harms alleged in the complaint. They are requesting a full evidentiary hearing under the Tunney Act, which allows interested parties to intervene and requires the court to determine whether a consent decree is in the public interest. Historically, such hearings are rare\u2014only one has occurred since 1974, in the 2019 CVS-Aetna merger case. The states\u2019 intervention signals a growing willingness of state AGs to challenge federal antitrust approvals, urging merging parties to prepare for potential delays, maintain thorough records of competitive analysis and remedial design, identify high-risk jurisdictions, engage in preemptive outreach to state AGs, and consult experienced antitrust counsel.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 12:12 PM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/13-state-attorneys-general-file-motion-to-intervene-in-federal-review-of-doj-s-settlement-allowing--ce7d5ddfd989f020)\n\n**Antitrust & Competition Technology Update Q2 2025**\nThe second quarter of 2025 marked a transformative period in global antitrust and competition enforcement, particularly in technology, AI, and digital markets. In the United States, the Trump administration's Department of Justice (DOJ) and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) demonstrated a recalibrated approach to mergers, with notable cases including Salesforce's $8 billion acquisition of Informatica and the DOJ's $14 billion challenge to HPE's acquisition of Juniper Networks. The HPE/Juniper settlement, which required divestiture of HPE\u2019s Instant On WLAN business and a licensing obligation from Juniper, was unusual in its remedy structure and raised concerns about political influence, especially amid reports of lobbying and dismissals of senior DOJ officials. Meanwhile, the surge of AI-focused 'acquihire' deals\u2014such as Google\u2019s attempted $2.4 billion acquisition of Windsurf talent and technologies without corporate control\u2014highlighted how leading firms are circumventing Hart-Scott-Rodino (HSR) filing requirements. Despite their non-reportable status, agencies are now actively investigating these transactions for anticompetitive intent, with former DOJ head Jonathan Kanter advocating for 'substance over form' scrutiny. On the litigation front, a landmark April 17, 2025, ruling by U.S. District Judge Leonie Brinkema found Google violated the Sherman Act in both adtech and search markets, marking a significant escalation in judicial willingness to impose structural remedies. This follows earlier defeats in the search and app store cases, collectively signaling a regulatory environment increasingly open to breaking up Google\u2019s digital empire. In Europe, the European Commission intensified enforcement under the Digital Markets Act (DMA), imposing \u20ac500 million on Apple and \u20ac200 million on Meta for gatekeeper violations. Apple was penalized for restricting app developers\u2019 ability to steer users to alternative channels, while Meta faced fines for its 'pay or consent' model that failed to offer a meaningful non-personalized advertising alternative. The Commission also launched its first labor market cartel case against Delivery Hero and Glovo, fining them \u20ac329 million for no-poach agreements, information sharing, and market allocation\u2014marking the first EU sanction for anticompetitive labor practices and a warning against minority stake investments enabling collusion. The Commission also initiated a sweeping review of its merger guidelines, seeking public input until September 2025, with a focus on innovation, ecosystem effects, 'killer acquisitions,' and the potential for an 'innovation defence'\u2014reflecting a shift toward forward-looking, dynamic competition analysis in fast-moving sectors like AI and digital platforms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 07:25 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/antitrust-competition-technology-update-1413761/)\n\n**WATCH: California seeks investigation into big tech merger**\nCalifornia Attorney General Rob Bonta announced on October 15, 2025, that he is joining 12 other Democratic state attorneys general in intervening in the $14 billion merger between Hewlett-Packard (HPE) and Juniper Networks. Bonta criticized the U.S. Department of Justice\u2019s (DOJ) settlement of the merger, alleging it resulted from backroom deals lacking transparency and failing to address anti-competitive concerns raised in the DOJ\u2019s original antitrust complaint. He claimed that officials from the Trump administration pressured the DOJ to approve the settlement despite objections from antitrust attorneys, who were allegedly fired for opposing the deal. Bonta emphasized that antitrust enforcement exists to protect consumers and ensure fair markets, not to benefit politically connected companies. The multi-state intervention seeks access to merger records, participation in court hearings, and a pause on the merger until proceedings conclude. Court documents filed in the U.S. District Court of Northern California allege that well-connected lobbyists influenced the settlement and that claims of anticompetitive behavior were downplayed. Bonta stated that this action is part of a broader pushback against what he describes as politically motivated actions by the Trump administration, including the indictment of New York AG Letitia James and the targeting of broadcast networks leading to Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s temporary removal. The DOJ defended its decision, asserting it was based solely on the merits of the transaction. HPE did not respond to requests for comment. The intervention motion was filed by attorneys general from Colorado, Connecticut, Hawaii, Illinois, Massachusetts, Minnesota, North Carolina, New York, Oregon, Washington, Wisconsin, and the District of Columbia.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 09:10 PM\nSource:[Laurel Leader-Call](https://www.leader-call.com/news/national/watch-california-seeks-investigation-into-big-tech-merger/article_dd18e32e-8f97-53d8-96dd-1b0eb989721f.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
