## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Fed rate paths 2-3 months after pause in cutting cycle**: Most relevant given we're 2.5 months from resolution and Fed just paused cuts
2. **Historical Fed behavior in election/transition years**: Less relevant as question is about April 2026
3. **Rate paths during "soft landing" scenarios**: Moderately relevant given current economic conditions
4. **Market-implied probabilities for near-term Fed decisions**: Highly relevant as direct market prediction

**Most Suitable**: Combination of (1) Fed rate paths after cutting pause and (4) market-implied probabilities, given the short 2.5-month timeframe.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 77 days (February 13 to April 30, 2026)

**FOMC Meetings Before Resolution**:
- March 18, 2026 (confirmed)
- Possibly one more meeting in April (typical schedule would be late April, but April 30 is the resolution date)

**Historical Pattern Analysis**:
- Fed typically moves in 25bp increments
- Current rate held at January 28, 2026 meeting after three consecutive cuts
- Market expects no change until at least June (per CNBC)
- CME FedWatch shows 73.4% probability of no change by April 29

**Recent Rate Path**:
- September 2024: 5.00% → December 2024: 4.50% → September 2025: 4.25% → October 2025: 4.00% → December 2025: 3.75% → January 2026: 3.75% (held)

The Fed cut 125bp over 15 months, then paused. Historical precedent suggests pauses after cutting cycles often last multiple meetings.

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate from Market Data**: CME FedWatch probabilities (February 12, 2026) provide the most direct prediction:
- 73.4% at 3.75% (no change)
- 25.2% at 3.50% (one cut)
- 1.4% at 3.25% (two cuts)

**Expert Forecasts Diverge**:
- Goldman Sachs (late 2025): Predicted cuts in March and June, terminal rate 3.25%
- J.P. Morgan (February 4, 2026): No cuts in 2026, hold at 3.75%

The J.P. Morgan forecast is more recent and aligns better with market expectations and the Fed's January hold decision.

**Economic Context**:
- GDP growth strong (4.4% Q3, 5.4% Q4 tracking)
- Inflation "somewhat elevated" at ~3% vs 2% target
- Labor market stabilizing but not deteriorating
- Two FOMC members dissented for cuts, suggesting committee not unanimous on holding

**Key Factors for April 30**:
1. Only 1-2 FOMC meetings before resolution
2. Market strongly prices no change (73.4%)
3. Recent expert consensus shifting toward holding pattern
4. Economic data not showing deterioration requiring cuts
5. Fed typically moves cautiously and signals changes in advance

**Probability Assessment**:
- Most likely outcome: 3.75% (status quo) - ~70%
- Second most likely: 3.50% (one 25bp cut) - ~25%
- Lower probability: 3.25% (two cuts) or 4.00% (one hike) - ~5% combined

The short timeframe, recent pause, strong economic data, and market pricing all support a high probability of no change, with a meaningful but smaller probability of one cut.

Outside view calibration:

The market-implied probabilities from CME FedWatch provide a strong anchor, showing 73.4% for 3.75%, 25.2% for 3.50%, and 1.4% for 3.25%. However, I need to account for:

1. **Tail risks**: While markets show <2% probability of outcomes outside 3.25%-3.75%, historical Fed behavior includes occasional surprises. The two dissenting votes for cuts suggest internal debate.

2. **Expert disagreement**: Goldman Sachs predicted cuts while J.P. Morgan predicts holds. This uncertainty should widen the distribution slightly.

3. **Time decay**: With 77 days remaining, new economic data (2 employment reports, 2 inflation reports) could shift Fed thinking.

4. **Historical upset rate**: Fed decisions are generally well-telegraphed, but surprises occur ~5-10% of the time when economic conditions shift rapidly.

5. **Range considerations**: 
   - Downside (lower rates): Two cuts to 3.25% is possible but unlikely (~5-10%)
   - Further downside to 3.00%: Very unlikely but not impossible in crisis scenario (~1-2%)
   - Upside (higher rates): One hike to 4.00% is mentioned by J.P. Morgan for 2027 but very unlikely by April 2026 (~1-2%)
   - Further upside to 4.25%+: Extremely unlikely (~<1%)

Given the strong status quo bias, recent pause, and market pricing, I'll construct a distribution heavily weighted toward 3.75% but with meaningful probability mass at 3.50% and small tail probabilities:

- 10th percentile: Should capture downside tail, including possibility of two cuts
- 20th percentile: One cut scenario begins here
- 40th percentile: Still in one-cut territory but approaching status quo
- 60th percentile: Firmly in status quo territory
- 80th percentile: Status quo remains most likely
- 90th percentile: Should capture small upside tail risk

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.25
Percentile 20: 3.50
Percentile 40: 3.75
Percentile 60: 3.75
Percentile 80: 3.75
Percentile 90: 4.00
