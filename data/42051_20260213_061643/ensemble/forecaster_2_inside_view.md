Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**High-Quality, Factual Sources:**
- **Capital.com (Feb 12, 2026)**: Reports current Fed funds rate at 3.5-3.75% (upper bound 3.75%) as of January 2026. Fed's December 2025 projections indicated one 25bp cut for 2026, targeting 3.1-3.4% year-end (upper bound 3.4%). Consensus forecasts converge on 3-3.5% neutral range. **Quality: Good** - cites official Fed projections and consensus.

- **CNBC Fed Survey (Jan 27, 2026)**: Survey of economists forecasts only two more quarter-point cuts in 2026, with Fed funds settling around 3% through 2027. GDP forecast 2.4% for 2026, CPI 2.7% by year-end. Recession probability 23%. **Quality: Excellent** - systematic survey with named experts (Bostjancic, Sinai, Swonk, Gordon).

- **J.P. Morgan Research (Feb 4, 2026)**: Chief U.S. Economist Michael Feroli states JPM no longer expects Fed cuts in 2026; projects rate staying at 3.5-3.75% through 2026, with potential 25bp hike in Q3 2027. Rationale: economy at equilibrium, rates not restrictive. **Quality: Excellent** - named expert with clear methodology.

- **CME FedWatch (Feb 12, 2026)**: Market-implied probabilities show 73% no change, 25% one cut, 1% two cuts by late April 2026. **Quality: Excellent** - objective market pricing data.

**Moderate-Quality Sources:**
- **Economic Times (Feb 12, 2026)**: Reports Fed held rates at 3.50-3.75% in January 2026, noting FOMC split between doves (Harker, Goolsbee, Daly) concerned about labor softening and hawks (Waller, Cook, Schmid) worried about inflation. December 2025 projections showed one 25bp cut expected. **Quality: Good** - factual reporting with named officials.

**Lower-Relevance Sources:**
- Articles about Turkey, Australia, mortgage rates, and other central banks provide context but limited direct relevance to U.S. Fed decision by April 30, 2026.

**Key Facts vs. Opinions:**
- **Fact**: Current upper bound is 3.75% (multiple sources confirm)
- **Fact**: Fed paused in January 2026 after three cuts in 2025
- **Fact**: December 2025 Fed projections indicated one more 25bp cut for 2026
- **Opinion (Expert)**: JPM's Feroli expects no cuts in 2026 (diverges from Fed's own projection)
- **Opinion (Consensus)**: Most forecasters expect 1-2 cuts bringing rate to ~3% by year-end

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Fed's own December 2025 projection** (one 25bp cut for 2026 → 3.4% upper bound year-end): This is the FOMC's median forecast, though not binding. However, April 30 is only 4 months into 2026, well before year-end. **Impact: Moderate downward pressure, but timing suggests status quo more likely by April.**

2. **Market pricing (CME FedWatch)**: 73% probability of no change by late April, 25% one cut. This reflects collective wisdom of traders with money at stake. **Impact: Strong evidence for status quo (3.75%) as modal outcome.**

3. **Recent Fed pause (January 2026)**: After three consecutive cuts, Fed held steady, signaling caution. Historical pattern: post-pause, next move occurs at second or third meeting ~40% of time. With March 18 and April 29-30 meetings remaining, probability of cut by April 30 is moderate but not dominant. **Impact: Supports 70-75% status quo probability.**

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **JPM forecast (no cuts in 2026)**: High-quality source but represents one institution's view against consensus. Rationale (economy at equilibrium, rates not restrictive) is plausible but contested. **Impact: Slight upward pressure on status quo probability.**

2. **FOMC internal split**: Documented division between doves and hawks suggests no clear consensus for immediate action. **Impact: Reinforces status quo bias.**

3. **Inflation still elevated**: Core PCE ~2.4-2.7%, above 2% target. Labor market stable but not weakening sharply. **Impact: Reduces urgency for cuts.**

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Consensus forecasts for year-end 2026**: While useful for long-term view, April 30 is too early in the year for most projected cuts to materialize.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeframe**: 77 days from Feb 13, 2026 to April 30, 2026.

**FOMC meetings in window**: 
- March 18, 2026 (34 days away)
- April 29-30, 2026 (76-77 days away)

**If timeframe halved (38 days, ~March 18 only)**: Would increase status quo probability to ~85-90%, as Fed typically doesn't cut immediately after a pause. Single meeting reduces opportunity for action.

**If timeframe doubled (154 days, ~August 2026)**: Would significantly increase cut probability to 60-70%, as this spans 4 FOMC meetings and aligns better with Fed's year-end projection of one cut. More time allows data-dependent Fed to respond to evolving conditions.

**Key insight**: April 30 is early in 2026. Even if Fed cuts once in 2026 (per its projection), timing could be May-December. Market pricing (25% one cut by late April) reflects this timing uncertainty.

## (d) Justification for Inside View Adjustment

**Starting point (Outside view)**: 70% no change, 28% one cut, 2% other outcomes.

**Adjustments based on current evidence**:

1. **Fed's own projection (one cut in 2026) + timing**: While Fed projects one cut, April 30 is very early. Historically, when Fed projects annual cuts, they're distributed across the year. Given January pause, March cut seems unlikely (too soon). April cut possible but not probable. **Adjustment: Minimal - outside view already captures this via market pricing.**

2. **JPM's no-cuts forecast vs. consensus**: Creates uncertainty but doesn't override market pricing which already reflects diverse views. **Adjustment: Slight increase in status quo probability from 70% to 72%.**

3. **FOMC split and inflation above target**: Reinforces caution, making immediate action less likely. **Adjustment: Increase status quo to 74%.**

4. **Strong labor market + solid growth**: Reduces urgency for easing. **Adjustment: Final status quo at 75%.**

**Tail risks**:
- **Upside (hike)**: Very unlikely (2-3%) but non-zero if tariff-driven inflation spike or financial instability occurs
- **Downside (two cuts)**: Extremely unlikely (<1%) by April 30 given recent pause and timing

**Final distribution logic**:
- 75% probability upper bound stays at 3.75%
- 23% probability of one 25bp cut → 3.50%
- 1% probability of two cuts → 3.25%
- 1% probability of hike → 4.00%

## Distribution Calibration

**Modal outcome**: 3.75% (status quo) - 75% probability

**Percentile mapping**:
- 10th percentile: Must capture downside tail. With 24% cumulative probability of cuts, 10th percentile falls in the "one cut" scenario → 3.50%
- 20th percentile: Still in "one cut" range → 3.52%
- 40th percentile: Approaching modal outcome → 3.70%
- 60th percentile: Within modal outcome → 3.75%
- 80th percentile: Still modal outcome (75% mass) → 3.75%
- 90th percentile: Beginning to capture upside tail → 3.85%

**Refinement**: The 75% mass at 3.75% is very concentrated. To create strictly increasing percentiles while respecting this concentration:
- Spread the modal outcome slightly (3.70-3.80 range)
- Ensure lower percentiles capture the 23% "one cut" probability
- Ensure upper percentiles capture the 2% "hike" probability

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Upper bound of Federal Funds Target Range on April 30, 2026, in percent. Currently 3.75%.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 70% no change (3.75%), 28% one cut (3.50%), 2% other. My inside view shifts this to 75%/23%/2%, a modest adjustment justified by Fed's recent pause and timing considerations.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 3.75%; mean = 3.73%. This makes sense - heavily weighted toward status quo with small downside tail.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - CME FedWatch: 73% no change by late April (factual, market-based)
   - Fed paused in January 2026 after three cuts (factual, signals caution)
   - Fed's December projection: one cut in 2026, but timing uncertain (factual projection)
   - JPM forecast: no cuts in 2026 (expert opinion, contrarian to consensus)
   - Inflation 2.4-2.7%, above 2% target (factual, reduces cut urgency)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Unexpected financial market stress or sharp labor market deterioration in March 2026 could force emergency cut(s), pushing outcome down to 3.25-3.50%. Conversely, tariff-driven inflation spike could trigger hike to 4.00%.

6. **Status quo outcome**: 3.75% is current rate. Given 77-day timeframe and Fed's cautious stance, status quo is highly likely. My 75% probability reflects appropriate conservatism.

7. **Technicalities**: Values in percent, strictly increasing, within 0-7% bounds.
