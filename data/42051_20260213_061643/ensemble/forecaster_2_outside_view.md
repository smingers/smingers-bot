**CNBC Article (Jeff Cox, January 28, 2026):**
- **Quality:** Major financial news outlet, detailed coverage
- **Date:** January 28, 2026
- **Key Facts:** Fed held at 3.5-3.75% after three consecutive cuts. Strong GDP growth (Q3: 4.4%, Q4 tracking: 5.4%). Inflation "somewhat elevated" near 3%. Two dissents (Miran and Waller) favored cuts. **Market expectation: wait until at least June for next move**. Futures price at most two cuts in 2026.

**Goldman Sachs Research:**
- **Quality:** Top-tier investment bank research, named expert (Jan Hatzius, chief economist)
- **Date:** Appears to be from late 2025 (references September data, December meeting as future)
- **Key Facts (Opinion):** Forecast terminal rate of 3.0-3.25% (upper bound 3.25%). Expected cuts in March and June 2026 after January pause. Downside risk (further cuts) seen as greater than upside risk.

**J.P. Morgan Research (Michael Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist):**
- **Quality:** Top-tier investment bank research, named expert

- **Key Facts (Opinion):** **Forecasts NO rate cuts in 2026**, holding at 3.5-3.75% through year-end. Projects rate HIKE in Q3 2027. Rationale: economy in equilibrium, rates not restrictive. Only cuts if labor market weakens materially or inflation falls significantly.

**Agent Report (CME FedWatch & Historical Analysis):**
- **Quality:** Synthesis of market data and historical patterns
- **Date:** February 12, 2026
- **Key Facts:** CME FedWatch for April 29, 2026 meeting: 73.4% probability of 3.75%, 25.2% probability of 3.50%, 1.4% probability of 3.25%. Historical analysis shows post-peak >5% periods varied widely (9-43 months, median 13 months).

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **All Fed rate changes since 1990:** Too broad - includes multiple different economic regimes and policy approaches.

2. **Post-peak cutting cycles (5 cycles since 1990):** Relevant but varied widely. Current cycle peaked at 5.50% in July 2023, dropped to 5.00% by September 2024 (12 months above 5%), now at 3.75% (February 2026).

3. **Recent Fed pauses during cutting cycles (2019, 2024-2026):** Most relevant. The current situation involves:
   - Three consecutive 25bp cuts (Sept-Dec 2025)
   - A pause at January 2026 meeting
   - Strong economic growth but elevated inflation
   - Question is whether Fed resumes cuts or holds

4. **Fed policy 2.5 months from current meeting:** **Most suitable reference class**. We need to forecast April 30, 2026, which is 77 days away. There are two scheduled FOMC meetings before then: March 18, 2026 and potentially one in late April (though FOMC typically meets 8 times per year, so April meeting uncertain).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 77 days (February 13 to April 30, 2026)

**Scheduled FOMC Meetings:**
- March 18, 2026 (34 days away)
- Next regular meeting likely May or June 2026

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**
- Since December 10, 2025 (64 days ago), rate has been stable at 3.75%
- January 28, 2026 meeting resulted in hold decision
- Fed typically moves in 25bp increments when adjusting
- Recent history: Fed cut 25bp at three consecutive meetings before pausing

**Short-term stability factors:**
- Strong GDP growth (4.4%-5.4%)
- Inflation still elevated near 3% (above 2% target)
- Labor market stabilizing
- Market expectations: no move until June at earliest

## (d) Justification

The outside view prediction must account for:

1. **Status Quo Baseline (3.75%):** Very strong. The Fed just held in January 2026, and only 77 days remain until resolution. Market probabilities show 73.4% chance of no change by April 29 meeting.

2. **Divergent Expert Opinions:**
   - Goldman Sachs (late 2025): Expected cuts in March and June, terminal rate 3.25%
   - J.P. Morgan (Feb 2026): No cuts in 2026, hold at 3.75% all year
   - Market consensus: Wait until June for any move

3. **Economic Context:**
   - Strong growth argues against urgent need for cuts
   - Elevated inflation argues against cuts
   - Stabilizing labor market is neutral
   - Two FOMC dissents favored MORE cuts (not fewer), suggesting some dovish pressure

4. **Possible Outcomes by April 30:**
   - **Most likely (70-75%):** Hold at 3.75% - only one meeting (March 18) before resolution, strong economy, elevated inflation
   - **Second most likely (20-25%):** One 25bp cut to 3.50% at March meeting - if data weakens or inflation drops
   - **Low probability (3-5%):** Two 25bp cuts to 3.25% - would require March cut plus emergency inter-meeting cut or surprise April meeting
   - **Very low probability (<2%):** Rate increase - contradicts all current guidance
   - **Very low probability (<1%):** More than two cuts - extremely unlikely in 77 days

5. **Historical Upset Rate:**
   - Fed policy is generally predictable in near-term
   - Major surprises (like emergency cuts) are rare but possible
   - Recent dissents show internal disagreement, adding uncertainty

Outside view calibration:

The distribution should be centered heavily on 3.75% (current rate) with:
- Modest probability mass at 3.50% (one cut scenario)
- Small probability at 3.25% (two cuts scenario)
- Minimal probability at higher rates (increases very unlikely given recent cutting cycle)
- Tiny tail probability at lower rates (more than two cuts in 77 days extremely rare)

The 10th percentile should capture downside scenarios (unexpected weakness requiring aggressive cuts), while the 90th percentile should capture upside scenarios (unexpected strength or inflation requiring hold or even increase).

Given:
- 73.4% market probability of 3.75%
- 25.2% market probability of 3.50%
- 1.4% market probability of 3.25%
- Strong economic data supporting hold
- Only one certain FOMC meeting before resolution

Conservative percentile estimates:
- 10th percentile: 3.25% (captures scenario of two cuts or unexpected weakness)
- 20th percentile: 3.50% (captures one-cut scenario)
- 40th percentile: 3.75% (modal outcome - hold)
- 60th percentile: 3.75% (modal outcome continues to dominate)
- 80th percentile: 3.75% (still modal, but beginning to account for small upside risk)
- 90th percentile: 4.00% (captures tail scenario of rate increase or reversal of recent cut)

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.25
Percentile 20: 3.50
Percentile 40: 3.75
Percentile 60: 3.75
Percentile 80: 3.75
Percentile 90: 4.00
