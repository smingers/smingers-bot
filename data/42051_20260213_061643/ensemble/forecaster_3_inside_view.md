Analysis:

**1) Target variable / resolution criteria (paraphrase)**  
Forecast the **upper bound (%) of the FOMC federal funds target range effective on April 30, 2026**, as shown in the Fed’s implementation note / FRED series **DFEDTARU** (most recent FOMC meeting prior to or on Apr 30).

## (a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; date)

- **FRED (DFEDTARU)** (primary data; highest quality; current through Feb 2026):  
  *Fact:* Upper bound is currently **3.75%** (target range **3.50–3.75**), unchanged since Dec 2025 and held at the Jan 28, 2026 meeting.

- **CME Group pages (fed funds futures product pages)** (high quality as market-infrastructure info, but these pages are promotional/educational; no specific forecast numbers in the provided summaries):  
  *Fact:* Fed funds futures reflect market pricing.  
  *Limitation:* The supplied CME summaries themselves don’t include explicit April 2026 probabilities.

- **Capital.com rate forecast article (Feb 12, 2026)** (secondary/retail analysis; moderate quality; dated):  
  *Facts reported:* Current rate 3.50–3.75; Fed paused Jan 2026.  
  *Opinion/interpretation:* Fed SEP suggests limited easing in 2026; “neutral” ~3–3.5.

- **CNBC Fed Survey (Jan 27, 2026)** (major outlet summarizing a survey; moderate-high quality; dated):  
  *Fact (survey result):* Respondents expect **~2 cuts in 2026 total**, rate ~3% in 2026.  
  *Note:* Survey is not binding; useful as “expert consensus” snapshot.

- **J.P. Morgan research summary (Feb 4, 2026)** (identifiable top-tier house view; high quality; current):  
  *Opinion (Feroli):* **No cuts in 2026**, hold at **3.50–3.75** all year; possible hike in 2027.  
  *Conditional:* Cuts only if labor weakens or inflation drops materially.

- **Investing.com (RU) market wrap (Feb 12, 2026)** (market commentary; moderate quality, but cites concrete labor/inferred FedWatch shifts):  
  *Fact:* January jobs/wages surprise strong; implied odds of near-term cuts fell (March cut probability dropped sharply).  
  *Implication:* Nudges toward “hold” at March/April.

- **Economic Times summary (Feb 12, 2026)** (secondary summary of Fed debate; moderate quality):  
  *Fact-like:* Fed held at Jan meeting; committee split; Dec 2025 SEP median ~one cut in 2026.  
  *Opinion:* Highlights uncertainty and internal factions.

- **Yahoo Finance (Feb 12, 2026) on NY Fed bill purchases** (reputable; moderate-high quality):  
  *Fact:* Elevated bill purchases for reserve management until mid-April; described as *technical*, not stimulus.  
  *Relevance:* Indirect; mainly suggests Fed wants smooth rate control, not a signal of imminent easing.

- **Forbes mortgage rates (Feb 11, 2026)** (retail finance; moderate quality):  
  *Fact:* Mortgage rates drifting down; reiterates Fed is paused and future depends on inflation/economy.  
  *Relevance:* Weak for the policy rate itself.

(Other AskNews items about Turkey/Brazil/Australia are not relevant to the Fed funds upper bound.)

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

**Strong evidence (moves forecast meaningfully):**
1. **Status quo + institutional cadence:** Current upper bound **3.75%** and next key decisions are at **Mar 18** and **Apr 28–29** meetings (structural; Fed typically moves in 25 bp steps).  
2. **Market repricing after strong labor/wages (Feb 12 commentary):** Near-term cut odds **fell sharply** after strong jobs/wages—directly relevant to March/April decisions.  
3. **High-quality “house view” (JPM):** A major bank’s baseline is **no cuts in 2026**, reinforcing the “hold through April” scenario.

**Moderate evidence:**
4. **CNBC survey / consensus:** Experts cluster around limited additional easing (often 1–2 cuts in 2026), consistent with *some* chance of a cut by/after April but not a strong signal that it *must* happen by Apr 30.  
5. **Fed internal division (Economic Times summary):** Supports uncertainty/wider tails, but doesn’t strongly point to a cut *by April*.

**Weak evidence (small tweaks):**
6. **NY Fed reserve-management purchases:** mostly technical; could marginally reduce odds of funding-stress surprises, but not a clear directional signal for the target range.  
7. **Mortgage-rate drift:** noisy and downstream of Treasury yields/term premia.

## (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Time left:** Feb 13 → Apr 30, 2026 is **~76 days**.  
- **Meetings before resolution:** **Mar 17–18** and **Apr 28–29** (April meeting is especially pivotal because it is immediately before Apr 30).  
- **If timeframe were halved (~38 days):** only the March meeting would matter; probability mass would concentrate even more on **3.75%**.  
- **If timeframe were doubled (~152 days):** you’d include June/July meetings; probability of **3.50% or lower** would rise substantially.

## (d) Justification (inside-view adjustment vs outside view)

**Outside-view base distribution (given):**  
P10 3.25; P20 3.50; P40 3.75; P60 3.75; P80 3.75; P90 4.00.

**Key inside-view updates since that base:**
- The **January labor + wages surprise** and associated **drop in near-term cut probabilities** pushes probability mass **upward (toward holding at 3.75)** for both March and April meetings.  
- **J.P. Morgan’s “no cuts in 2026”** is a high-signal expert forecast that aligns with the “hold through April” story.  
- Counterweight: the **Fed is not hiking now** and the recent trend was easing in 2025; there remains a meaningful (but reduced) path to **one cut by April** if inflation cools quickly or activity softens between now and late April.

Net effect: compared with the outside view, I **nudge the center upward (more weight on 3.75)**, **slightly reduce** the one-cut-by-April likelihood, and **widen the upper tail** a bit to reflect small-but-real risk of a hawkish surprise (sticky inflation / policy credibility) at the April meeting.

Distribution calibration

- **Status quo / trend-continued outcome:** Hold at **3.75%** through April remains the modal outcome.  
- **Main “downside” (lower rates) path:** one 25 bp cut by Apr 29 → upper bound **3.50%**.  
- **Lower tail (more easing):** two cuts (March + April) → **3.25%** (unlikely but plausible if data deteriorates abruptly).  
- **Upper tail:** hike to **4.00%** by April (low probability) or even **4.25%** in a more extreme inflation re-acceleration / credibility shock scenario (very low, but I keep some tail width as instructed).

Checklist:
1) **Variable:** Upper bound of Fed funds target range (%) effective **Apr 30, 2026** per Implementation Note / **FRED DFEDTARU**.  
2) **Outside view base:** (3.25, 3.50, 3.75, 3.75, 3.75, 4.00).  
3) **Consistency:** Implied median ≈ **3.75**; mean ≈ **3.65–3.75** (centered near hold). Seems aligned.  
4) **Top evidence (3–5):**  
   - Current upper bound **3.75**; two meetings (Mar, Apr) before resolution.  
   - Strong jobs/wages surprise reduced near-term cut odds.  
   - JPM house view: **no cuts in 2026** baseline.  
   - Expert surveys/SEP imply limited easing, but not necessarily by April.  
5) **Blind spot:** A sudden growth scare/financial accident prompting rapid easing (would push outcome **down** to 3.50 or 3.25).  
6) **Status quo pull:** With ~2.5 months and no current crisis, “no change” is a strong default.  
7) **Technicalities:** Percentiles strictly increasing; units in percent.
