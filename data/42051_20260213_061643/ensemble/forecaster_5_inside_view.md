Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, all dated 11-13 Feb 2026 unless noted)

1. Investing.com Russia note (12 Feb): cites CME FedWatch probabilities after strong Jan NFP (only 5 % chance of a March cut, 22 % chance by April).  Data come from CME and BLS; high factual quality, clearly dated.

2. J.P. Morgan research note (4 Feb): Michael Feroli now projects NO cuts in 2026.  JP Morgan’s economics desk has a respectable track-record; single expert view → moderate weight.

3. CNBC Fed Survey (27 Jan): 30 economists/strategists; median view = two 25 bp cuts in 2026, none before H2.  Consensus snapshot; useful as aggregated expert opinion.

4. Capital.com roundup (12 Feb): summarises December 2025 SEP (one more 25 bp cut by end-26) and private forecasts converging on 3-3¼ %.  News-aggregator quality; factual parts reliable, opinion parts low weight.

5. FedWatch (implicit via CME futures strip): market prices imply ≈ 75 % probability the target range is still 3.50-3.75 % after the 29 Apr meeting.  Market-implied data → strong evidence.

6. FRED DFEDTARU series: current upper bound = 3.75 % (fact).

7. AskNews and other articles about Turkey, Australia, mortgages, etc. – macro-contextual but not directly bearing on the U.S. Fed’s April decision; ignored for forecasting.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong
• CME Fed-funds futures strip / FedWatch probabilities (market, real money).
• Current target range (3.50-3.75 %) and schedule: only one regular FOMC (17-18 Mar) before 30 Apr.

Moderate
• J.P. Morgan “no cuts in 2026”.
• CNBC survey: two cuts in 2026 but later.
• December 2025 SEP: one cut in 2026.

Weak
• Generic mortgage-rate articles, global central-bank moves.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days to resolution: 77.  Halving (≈ 5½ weeks): almost all uncertainty would resolve because the 18 Mar decision would be known, so forecast would collapse toward 100 % in whichever bin the Fed chose.  Doubling (≈ 5 months): three FOMC meetings → probability of at least one move rises sharply and the distribution would widen.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base (derived from five post-pause episodes since 1994): 60 % chance of a 25 bp cut at the very next meeting, 40 % hold.

Current inside information strongly favours “hold”:

• FedWatch now prices only 25 % combined probability of ≤ 3.50 % by end-April (strong evidence).  
• Latest data surprise on the hot side (NFP, wage growth), lowering likelihood of an imminent cut.  
• J.P. Morgan, SEP, CNBC consensus all point to at most one cut in 2026 and not necessarily in March (moderate evidence).  
• Structural constraint: with the unemployment rate still 4.3 % and core PCE 2.6-2.8 %, the Fed can wait (strong causal logic).

We therefore shift 30 percentage-points of probability mass from “cut” to “hold”, modestly thicken both tails (small hike or surprise double-cut) for shocks.

Final discrete probability grid (used to derive percentiles)
• 3.00 % upper bound………… 0.5 %
• 3.25 % …………………………… 3 %
• 3.50 % …………………………… 18.5 %
• 3.75 % …………………………… 70 %
• 4.00 % …………………………… 7 %
• 4.25 % …………………………… 1 %

Linear interpolation between grid points → percentiles:

Checklist:
1. Target = upper bound of Fed-funds target range effective 30 Apr 2026, percent. ✔  
2. Outside-view distribution stated, inside-view anchored to it. ✔  
3. Implied median ≈ 3.69 %, mean ≈ 3.69 % – matches rationale (modal = 3.75 %). ✔  
4. Key evidence: FedWatch probabilities; strong Jan jobs/wages; JP Morgan no-cut call; SEP one-cut; only one FOMC before deadline. ✔  
5. Blind-spot: severe financial shock (e.g., major bank failure) forcing a 50 bp emergency cut → pushes outcome down to 3.25 % or below.  
6. Status-quo bias acknowledged; distribution still gives 22 % weight to cuts, 8 % to hikes.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, correct units, within open bounds. ✔
