This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves to the value of the upper bound of the target range for the federal funds rate as set by the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), effective on April 30, 2026. The primary source for resolution is the Federal Reserve Board's official 'Implementation Note' or 'Policy Statement' issued following the most recent FOMC meeting prior to or on April 30, 2026. If the Federal Reserve specifies a single target rate rather than a range, that single rate will serve as the resolution value. Resolves based on data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis (FRED) series 'DFEDTARU' (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFEDTARU)

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-13. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-13 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

The lower bound is 0 and the upper bound is 7.
Both bounds are OPEN: outcomes can fall below the lower bound or above the upper bound. Your percentile estimates may extend beyond this range if well-supported by evidence.
