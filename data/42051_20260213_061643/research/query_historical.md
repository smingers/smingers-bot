Analysis:
We need an outside-view baseline for where the Federal Funds Target Range typically stands two years after the last tightening cycle peak. Useful context includes: 1) historical paths of the upper bound around past disinflation episodes (e.g., 2000-2003, 2007-2009, 2019-2020, 2022-2024), 2) the Fed’s own forward guidance—SEP “dot plots” and policymaker speeches—showing expected 2025-26 rates, and 3) market-implied expectations (Fed funds futures, OIS) for April 2026. Key data are the Fed’s official statements and the FRED series DFEDTARU. Recent news coverage of FOMC meetings and analysts’ rate forecasts will also help. These elements let us judge how far and how fast the Fed is likely to ease from the current 5.50 % upper bound prior to 30 Apr 2026.
