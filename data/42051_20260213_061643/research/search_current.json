The inflation forecast range for the end of 2027 remains unchanged at 6%-12%. The intermediate targets were not altered: 16% for 2026 and 9% for 2027, with the 2028 target set at 8%. During a briefing at the TCMB headquarters in Istanbul Financial Center, Deputy Governors Hatice Karahan, Osman Cevdet Ak\u00e7ay, Fatma \u00d6zkul, and Gazi \u0130shak Kara attended. Karahan emphasized a data-driven approach to the interest rate reduction process, stating that the threshold for increasing the step size in the short term is considered too high. He noted that adjusting the step size and using messaging is a more appropriate way to conduct monetary policy, and clarified that no specific real interest rate target is being pursued. Karahan highlighted that there has been a clear slowdown in rent inflation and stressed the need to observe inflation data from March and April 2026 before the inflation outlook becomes clearer. Regarding the exchange rate, \u00d6zkul stated, 'We do not foresee any change in the current exchange rate regime, and we have no exchange rate target.' On the impact of gold's wealth effect, Karahan said, 'There has been a wealth effect of up to $200 billion since last year.'\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 04:10 AM\nSource:[Sabah](https://www.sabah.com.tr/ekonomi/merkez-tahmin-araligini-yukseltti-7523066)\n\n**Australia's Central Bank Continues Rate Hikes as AUD Rally Shows No Signs of Stopping**\nThe Australian dollar has continued its upward momentum, breaking above the downward trend line resistance of 0.6630, which had been in place since February 2021. After a prolonged decline that saw the currency fall to around 0.59 in April 2025, it took nine months to break through the resistance, triggering accelerated gains. By the week ending February 3, 2026, speculative positions in the Australian dollar among hedge funds and other large traders increased by 43%, reaching 57,115 contracts\u2014the highest level since late 2017, according to the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission. This surge in positioning reflects growing market confidence in the AUD, driven by its relatively high yield and expectations that the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will maintain elevated interest rates for an extended period. The market now fully prices in a rate hike in June. The RBA raised its key interest rate by 25 basis points to 3.85% on the previous Tuesday, becoming the first major economy to hike rates in 2026. The nine-member monetary policy committee unanimously voted to tighten policy, citing persistent domestic inflation pressures. The RBA\u2019s quarterly Monetary Policy Statement revised upward inflation, GDP growth, and employment forecasts for 2026, with the trimmed mean inflation measure expected to remain above the 2%-3% target range and not return to the midpoint until late 2027. RBA Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser delivered hawkish remarks, stating that inflation pressures remain and the central bank would act without hesitation to ensure price stability, reinforcing expectations of another rate hike later in the year. As of the writing, the AUD reached a three-year high of 0.7120. Short-term targets are set at 0.7280, with medium-term potential to test 0.76\u20130.77.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 01:16 AM\nSource:[AAStocks.com](http://www.aastocks.com/tc/stocks/news/comment.aspx)\n\n**New York Fed's Remache says elevated Fed bond buying to continue until mid-April**\nAccording to Julie Remache, deputy system open market account manager and head of market and portfolio analysis at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, the Fed is expected to continue elevated Treasury bill and short-term government bond purchases at around $40 billion per month until mid-April 2026. These reserve management purchases, initiated in December 2025, aim to rebuild financial system reserves and manage liquidity ahead of the annual tax filing deadline. As of February 12, 2026, the Fed\u2019s System Open Market Account (SOMA) holdings total $6.2 trillion. Remache stated that purchases will likely 'remain around elevated levels until mid-April' and that after that date, buying will be 'reduced substantially.' Post-mid-April purchase volumes will depend on reserve supply and demand, market conditions, and future outlooks. She emphasized 'notable uncertainty' about how demand for Fed liabilities will evolve and how that may affect the appropriate level of reserve supply. The Fed maintains that these purchases are technical and distinct from stimulus-driven asset buying during crises. The goal is to preserve control over the interest rate target range while allowing normal money market volatility. The Fed previously reduced its balance sheet from 2022 to late 2025 to absorb excess liquidity from the pandemic era.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 09:57 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The year-end target of 16% remained unchanged. The revision reflects the bank's acknowledgment of rising inflation pressures, particularly from the January shock increase and expected price adjustments in February. Market focus has shifted from the previous upper limit of 19% to the new upper bound of 21%, indicating heightened expectations. Key factors cited by TCMB Governor Fatih Karahan include a potential decline in service inflation, which has historically been a persistent driver of inflation in Turkey. He emphasized that demand support for disinflation has weakened slightly, retail sales (excluding gold) remain relatively strong, and food inflation is expected to be limited to January and February. Ramadan-related price increases are anticipated to repeat this year, but the worst of food inflation is expected to be behind. March and April data will be critical for clearer inflation visibility, with the possibility of inflation levels aligning with 2025 November-December trends by March. A significant focus is on rental inflation, which the Governor stated has begun a downward trend, with expectations of it falling to the 30% range by year-end. This would be a crucial step toward structural disinflation in services, which influence overall production and service costs and shape inflation expectations. Energy prices are expected to decline globally, influenced by U.S. election dynamics, with projections of $61 in 2026 and $56 in 2027, supported by continued state subsidies. The new T\u00dc\u0130K calculation method will raise the T\u00dcFE by approximately 1 percentage point, making disinflation appear statistically more challenging. The shift in pricing behavior in the education sector, now more stable, also contributes to the outlook. The TCMB's dual-band upward revision is framed as a cautious, transparent approach to risk management, avoiding over-optimism. The message is clear: 'The road is long, but the steering wheel is in our hands.' While markets remain skeptical\u2014questioning whether the road is truly straight\u2014the bank maintains that patience, resolve, and caution will guide continued interest rate cuts. If rental inflation falls to 30%, services inflation stabilizes, and goods inflation holds between 15-17%, inflation could reach 22-23% by the end of 2026, potentially allowing rates to drop to 30%. The 2027 target of 9% remains highly ambitious, especially given political calendar constraints and the difficulty of achieving rapid disinflation. Nonetheless, the market response has been positive, with banks leading a stock market rally driven by foreign inflows and confidence in the bank's risk-aware policy framework. The central message: 'The manager who manages risk, not the one who ignores it, wins.'\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 11:54 AM\nSource:[HABERTURK.COM](https://www.haberturk.com/ozel-icerikler/abdurrahman-yildirim-1018/3861264-kirada-kirilma-vurgusuyla-faizde-indirime-devam)\n\n**Thinking of early retirement in 2026? First, find your real financial independence target**\nThe article outlines a strategic approach to determining a realistic Financial Independence (FI) target for early retirement in 2026, emphasizing the need for precise calculations amid inflation, market volatility, and changing tax rules. It begins by urging readers to assess their actual annual expenses\u2014such as housing, groceries, utilities, insurance, education, health, and lifestyle costs\u2014excluding short-term EMIs. For example, if current annual expenses are Rs 18 lakh, inflation at 6% over 10 years raises this to approximately Rs 32 lakh. Using the 25x rule (based on the 4% withdrawal rule for sustainable retirement income), a retirement expense of Rs 30 lakh requires a corpus of Rs 7.5 crore. However, due to higher healthcare inflation and market volatility in India, a more conservative 30x rule (3\u20133.5% annual withdrawal) is recommended. Subtracting existing investments\u2014such as equity, mutual funds, PPF, EPF, and NPS\u2014from the target reveals the savings gap; for instance, a Rs 2.5 crore investment leaves a Rs 5 crore gap. The article advises stress-testing scenarios with lower returns, early retirement drawdowns, and major expenses like children\u2019s education or elderly care. It clarifies that primary residences are not counted unless rented or downsized, and while EPF and NPS are included in the corpus, their withdrawal restrictions and tax implications must be factored in. The goal is not just financial math but aligning the FI number with one\u2019s desired lifestyle and risk tolerance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 08:38 AM\nSource:[MoneyControl](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/thinking-of-early-retirement-in-2026-first-find-your-real-financial-independence-target-13825322.html)\n\n**Central Bank Releases First 2026 Inflation Report: Annual Inflation Target Confirmed**\nTurkey's Central Bank (TCMB), led by President Fatih Karahan, released its first 2026 'Inflation Report' on February 12, 2026. The report reaffirmed the 2026 annual inflation target at 16%, with a forecast range of 13% to 19%. Karahan emphasized the importance of maintaining tight monetary policy to sustain positive inflation effects, stating that all monetary policy tools will continue to be used. He highlighted signs of breaking inertia in services like rent, which could be pivotal in the de-escalation process. Demand composition is supporting disinflation, and the balance is being maintained under tight monetary policy. Industrial production remained flat in the last quarter, and the services sector sustained its horizontal trend. Unemployment rates improved in the fourth quarter. The current account deficit indicator showed a slight upward shift compared to the previous report period but remained negative in the last quarter; a moderate increase is projected for 2026. Consumer inflation decreased by 2.2 percentage points to 30.7% in January, though food inflation remained volatile. January saw a significant rise in food prices due to adverse weather, pushing inflation toward the upper band, with effects expected to partially persist into February. Rent inflation showed a downward trend, and service inflation in 2025 was largely driven by rent and education. Under various scenarios, rent inflation is projected to range between 30% and 36% by year-end. The bank noted the importance of using 12-month inflation instead of 24-month inflation for education price adjustments. Karahan stressed that the disinflation process must remain aligned with targets, and tight monetary policy will be pursued with resolve. To maintain operational flexibility in Turkish Lira liquidity management, the bank will continue supporting the AP\u0130 portfolio through gradual purchases. Karahan confirmed that interest rate decisions have significantly influenced deposit and credit pricing, and additional steps have been taken to align credit growth with the disinflation process and strengthen monetary transmission. TL deposit shares remained near historical averages at approximately 59%.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 08:09 AM\nSource:[Cumhuriyet](https://www.cumhuriyet.com.tr/ekonomi/merkez-bankasi-yilin-ilk-raporunu-acikladi-yil-sonu-enflasyon-hedefi-belli-oldu-2478173)\n\n**S&P 500 Focus on Thursday, February 12: Pause Before U.S. Inflation Data**\nOn February 12, 2026, the S&P 500 futures rose 0.27% to 6,963 points, above the lower boundary of the base target range of 6,950, with potential for further gains toward the upper target of 7,050. The Nasdaq 100 gained 0.24%, and the Dow Jones rose 0.34%. The previous day, the S&P 500 futures declined 0.10% to 6,943 points, the Nasdaq 100 rose 0.10% to 25,195 points, and the Dow Jones dropped 0.25% to 50,120 points. The weakest performers were banks and software companies: JPMorgan (JPM) fell 2.34%, Citigroup (C) dropped 3.90%, Wells Fargo (WFC) declined 3.22%, and Bank of America (BAC) fell 2.78%. The primary cause was the strong U.S. nonfarm payrolls report for January, which showed 130,000 new jobs\u2014more than double the forecast of 66,000 and the highest since June 2025. The unemployment rate unexpectedly dropped from 4.4% to 4.3%, the best since August 2025, while hourly wages accelerated from 0.1% to 0.4% month-over-month, the highest since October 2025. Revised 2025 data revealed 181,000 jobs were undercounted, while 2024 data showed 911,000 jobs were overcounted. As a result, the probability of a Federal Reserve rate cut in March fell from 20.1% to 5.4%, and the chance of easing in April dropped from 42.6% to 22.0%. The yield on 10-year U.S. Treasuries rose from 4.12% to 4.20%. A second factor affecting banks was a Morgan Stanley report highlighting $1.5 trillion in risks to the U.S. credit market due to AI-driven software development. Software companies represent 16% of corporate credit in the U.S., with 50% having credit ratings of B- or lower; AI tools could reduce demand, increasing default risks. Consequently, Microsoft (MSFT) dropped 2.15%, Alphabet (GOOG) fell 2.29%, Salesforce (CRM) declined 4.37%, and ServiceNow (NOW) dropped 5.54%. In contrast, semiconductor, energy, and industrial stocks led gains: Micron (MU) surged 9.94% after denying HBM4 chip supply rumors, Exxon Mobil (XOM) rose 2.6%, and Caterpillar (CAT) gained 4.39%. Cyclical companies benefit from a strong economy. Today\u2019s focus shifts to Friday\u2019s inflation data. If inflation slows, the market could see a favorable combination: strong labor growth and cooling prices. No major corporate earnings are scheduled today except Coinbase (COIN), whose report may signal crypto market recovery prospects for 2026. However, market sentiment remains cautious: SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) saw $3.6 billion in weekly sales on Tuesday, up from $1.27 billion the previous week, and after a $10.3 billion outflow two weeks prior, buying has not resumed. There is still no strong basis for expecting a significant market rally.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 06:22 AM\nSource:[Investing.com \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f](https://ru.investing.com/analysis/article-200328974)\n\n**US Stocks Today | Fed policymakers split on next step as inflation remains sticky and labor risks emerge**\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve held its policy rates steady at the January 2026 meeting, maintaining the federal funds rate target range at 3.50% to 3.75%, citing a resilient labor market and inflation still above the 2% target. This decision exposed a growing divide within the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), with 'doves' and 'centrists' like Philadelphia Fed President Patrick Harker, Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly, New York Fed President John Williams, and Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari expressing concern over potential labor market softening and economic slowdown due to restrictive monetary policy. In contrast, 'hawks' such as Fed Governor Christopher Waller, Cleveland Fed President Lisa Cook, Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, St. Louis Fed President Alberto Musalem, Richmond Fed President Thomas Barkin, and Atlanta Fed President Raphael Bostic (non-voting, retiring in February 2026) emphasized the need for continued vigilance, warning that premature rate cuts could reignite inflation.

Previous reports had set targets of 24% for 2025, 16% for 2026, and 9% for 2027. However, by November, the 2025 forecast range had risen to 31-33%, and the actual year-end inflation reached 30.89%. The 2026 central target of 16% is already seen by markets as overly optimistic, with expectations placed at 23-24%. Given the strong January data, there is a risk of shifting the annual trajectory upward, potentially prompting a revision in the Inflation Report. The current context already reflects an upwardly revised baseline, making a new upward adjustment highly sensitive in communication. The Central Bank faces two options: either raise the upper band of the forecast range or reinforce its messaging about 'temporary deviation'. The Bank\u2019s stance in its first interest rate decision\u2014'We will not relax until we see a persistent decline in inflation'\u2014has already signaled a firm commitment, which, while slightly lifting short-term market expectations, strengthens medium-term policy credibility. Although technical conditions support a revision, the psychological timing makes an immediate update unlikely at the first meeting. The Bank is expected to maintain its current targets while emphasizing risks and upside deviations more forcefully. A significant shift is more likely after reviewing February and March data. In summary, January\u2019s data is not alarming but serves as a warning. A revision is possible, but not expected at the first meeting. The key question remains: will February and March data push the door open?\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 04:03 AM\nSource:[Sabah](https://www.sabah.com.tr/yazarlar/ozlemdoganer/2026/02/12/ilk-toplantida-revizyon-gelecek-mi)\n\n**Mortgage Rates Today: February 11, 2026 - Rates Fall For 4th Straight Day**\nOn February 11, 2026, mortgage rates fell for the fourth consecutive day, according to Forbes Advisor. The average rate on a 30-year fixed mortgage dropped to 6.05%, down from 6.23% the previous week, with an APR of 6.08%. For a $100,000 loan, monthly principal and interest payments are approximately $603, totaling $117,624 in interest over the loan\u2019s life. The 15-year fixed mortgage rate also declined to 5.23% (from 5.41%), with a monthly payment of $803 and $44,906 in total interest. The 30-year jumbo mortgage rate decreased to 6.51% (from 6.60%), resulting in $633 monthly payments and $128,018 in total interest. This downward trend follows three Federal Reserve rate cuts in late 2025, which lowered the federal funds rate to a 3.50%\u20133.75% target range. At its January 28, 2026, FOMC meeting, the Fed held rates steady, pausing further cuts as it assessed economic data. Future rate movements depend on inflation, economic strength, and bond market yields. Factors influencing individual mortgage rates include credit score (670+ preferred), debt-to-income ratio (below 43%), loan-to-value ratio (20% down to avoid PMI), loan term (shorter terms offer lower rates), and property type (primary residence rates are lower). Borrowers can lower rates by comparing lenders, improving credit, increasing down payments, or purchasing discount points. While rates may dip further if inflation eases or the economy weakens, a return to 3% is unlikely in the near term.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2026 01:28 PM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-02-11-26/)\n\n**Stocks Flat After Fed Keeps Rates Steady**\nOn January 30, 2026, U.S. stock markets were flat following the Federal Reserve's decision to hold interest rates steady at its January meeting. The Federal Open Market Committee maintained the federal-funds rate target range at 3.5% to 3.75%, ending a series of three consecutive quarter-point rate cuts. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average traded near breakeven, while the Nasdaq Composite rose 0.2%. Prior to the announcement, the Dow and S&P 500 had been slightly down, but the Nasdaq was already up 0.2%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 07:11 AM\nSource:[Barrons](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-012826/card/stocks-flat-after-fed-keeps-rates-steady-yuFH6A8eSEi8Yw1LP8m5)\n\n**NY Bonds: U.S. Long-Term Bond Market Trades Range-Bound as FOMC Minutes Highlight Cautious Stance on Further Rate Cuts**\nThe U.S. long-term bond market showed a range-bound trading session on December 30, 2025, following the release of the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting minutes from the December 2025 meeting. The minutes revealed a detailed discussion among Fed officials regarding current economic risks, with some policymakers expressing caution about further rate cuts despite overall support for lowering rates. While most participants supported rate cuts, several emphasized that the progress toward the 2% inflation target has stalled, suggesting that the federal funds rate target range should remain unchanged for a period after any cut. Some participants also argued that rate cuts could be appropriate as a preemptive strategy to support labor market stability amid weakening job creation. Market expectations continue to reflect approximately two rate cuts in 2026. The yield curve showed a steepening trend, with the 2-year to 10-year spread at 67.80 basis points and the 2-year to 30-year spread at 136.10 basis points. The 10-year yield opened near 4.108%, dipped to around 4.102%, rose to 4.140%, and closed near 4.116%. The 2-year yield ended at 3.44% (down 1 basis point), the 10-year yield at 4.12% (up 1 basis point), and the 30-year yield at 4.80% (unchanged). According to CME's FedWatch tool, the probability of the federal funds rate target range being set at 3.50\u20133.75% at the January 2026 FOMC meeting was approximately 85%, and the probability of it being 3.25\u20133.50% or lower at the March 2026 meeting was about 52%.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: December 30, 2025 11:20 PM\nSource:[\u8ca1\u7d4c\u65b0\u805e](https://www.zaikei.co.jp/article/20251231/838453.html)\n\n**Fed's 'Three Consecutive Cuts' in 2025: What Lies Ahead for Interest Rates in 2026?**\nOn December 11, 2025, the Federal Reserve announced its third consecutive 25-basis-point rate cut of the year, lowering the federal funds rate target range to 3.50%-3.75%. The decision was met with internal division, as 3 out of 12 voting members opposed the move\u2014the first such occurrence since September 2019. The dissenters included Chicago Fed President Austan Goolsbee and Kansas City Fed President Jeffrey Schmid, while Fed Governor Stephen Moore called for a 50-basis-point cut. CNBC noted the 9-3 vote reflected ongoing tension between hawkish and dovish factions within the Fed. Fed Chair Jerome Powell stated that inflation remains 'at a high level' due to tariffs, emphasized the need for inflation to fall below 2%, and confirmed that monetary policy is not on a predetermined path, currently operating near the upper end of the neutral rate range. Financial markets reacted positively: the S&P 500 rose 0.77%, the Nasdaq gained 0.48%, and the Dow Jones increased over 1%. U.S. Treasury yields declined\u201410-year yields dropped over 4 basis points, and 2-year yields fell over 8 basis points. The U.S. dollar index dropped to 98.6455, with EUR, JPY, GBP, and AUD all appreciating against the dollar. The move aligned with market expectations, as CME FedWatch indicated a 87.6% probability of a 25-basis-point cut. Looking ahead, Accenture\u2019s global managing director Amir Bagherpour forecasts one to two additional cuts in 2026. Morgan Stanley predicts cuts through January 2026, followed by two more in April and July, bringing the target range to 3.00%-3.25%. Notably, Chair Powell\u2019s term ends in May 2026. On November 30, 2025, President Trump stated he had chosen his successor, with White House National Economic Council Director Kevin Hassett seen as the top candidate, pending Senate confirmation. The 'Super Central Bank Week' begins, with the ECB, BoJ, BoC, and SNB set to announce decisions. Japan\u2019s central bank is expected to raise rates by 25 basis points, though a dovish tone is likely. Bank of Japan Governor Kazuo Ueda cited reduced uncertainty around U.S. economic outlook and tariffs. On December 8, the 10-year JGB yield rose to 1.965%, the highest since June 2007, reflecting strong expectations for further tightening. The ECB has held rates at 2% for three meetings, believing inflation is at its 2% target. ECB Chief Economist Philip Lane estimated a 40%-50% chance of a rate cut by June 2026 if inflation risks shift downward. Markets expect the BoC and RBA to hold rates steady, while the SNB is expected to maintain a zero rate and avoid negative rates. In China, the Political Bureau of the CPC Central Committee, meeting on December 8, 2025, reaffirmed plans to implement more proactive fiscal policy and moderately accommodative monetary policy in 2026, emphasizing countercyclical and cross-cycle adjustments. Analysts such as Yang Chang of Zhongtai Securities and Xiong Yuan of Guosheng Securities predict continued expansionary fiscal policy, potential cuts in 2026 (1-2 rate cuts of 10-20 bps, and 1-2 reserve requirement cuts of 50-100 bps), and increased use of targeted tools to support 'five major areas'\u2014tech finance, green finance, inclusive finance, pension finance, and digital finance. Macquarie Securities forecasts a slight expansion in broad fiscal deficit and enhanced precision in monetary policy, with a focus on lowering real borrowing costs and stimulating private sector demand.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 10, 2025 11:57 PM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/roll/2025-12-11/doc-inhakmnn9863773.shtml)\n\n**BC Cannot Pursue Upper Band of Inflation Target, Says Gal\u00edpolo**\nGabriel Gal\u00edpolo, President of the Central Bank (BC), stated during a Senate Economic Affairs Committee (CAE) hearing on November 30, 2025, that the institution should not target the upper bound of the inflation target range\u20144.5%\u2014but rather the central target of 3%. He emphasized that the 4.5% upper limit was established as a buffer to absorb inflation fluctuations, not as the actual policy goal. Gal\u00edpolo acknowledged that, according to the Focus economic projections, the Central Bank will fail to meet the 3% inflation target throughout his entire mandate, which ends on January 31, 2028. Projections indicate inflation will be 4.18% by the end of 2026, 3.80% by the end of 2027, and 3.50% by the end of 2028\u2014each above the 3% central target.

The speaker explains that the Central Bank provided a forecast range of 16% to 26% for 2025 inflation, with 21% as the target, but advised evaluators to use the upper bound due to high uncertainty. The minimum wage adjustment was calculated by adding a 4% 'welfare premium' to the upper bound (26%), resulting in a 30% increase. The speaker asserts that this method was consistent and transparent, and now predicts the same scenario will be repeated in the current year, stating, 'I expect the same scenario this year.' The analysis is based on the Central Bank\u2019s forecast, the role of the government as a mediator, and the involvement of labor and employer representatives in the decision-making process.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: November 09, 2025 08:00 AM\nSource:[\u0130nternethaber](https://www.internethaber.com/cok-net-bir-tahmin-dedi-ilk-kez-duyurdu-gecen-seneki-asgari-ucreti-bilmisti-foto-galerisi-2418777.htm)\n\n**Easy-Money Policy Accelerates as the Fed Freezes QT and Lowers the Target Interest Rate**\nThe Federal Reserve's Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) reduced the target policy interest rate by 25 basis points to an upper bound of 4.0% on October 30, 2025, marking the fifth rate cut since September 2024, totaling a 150 basis point reduction over 13 months. The Fed also announced it will end quantitative tightening (QT) effective December 1, 2025, by halting the reduction of its balance sheet and replacing maturing assets to maintain current levels. The Fed will increase its holdings of Treasury securities while reducing mortgage-backed securities. Despite official inflation data showing core PCE inflation at 2.9% and core CPI at 3%\u2014well above the Fed\u2019s stated 2% target\u2014Chairman Jerome Powell claimed that inflation excluding tariffs is 'not so far from our 2 percent goal,' though no methodology or data were provided to support this new 'ex-tariff' measure. Powell cited a stagnant job market, with 'job creation... pretty close to zero,' and a declining labor supply due to falling labor-force participation and reduced immigration, as reasons for easing policy. The article argues that the Fed has effectively abandoned its 2% inflation target, shifting focus to economic stimulus and demand support, and warns that this policy could lead to renewed asset bubbles and malinvestment, with past 150-basis-point rate cuts without hikes historically preceding recessions (2001, 2008, 2020).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 08:00 AM\nSource:[Mises Institute](https://mises.org/mises-wire/easy-money-policy-accelerates-fed-freezes-qt-and-lowers-target-interest-rate)\n\n**Federal Reserve Announces Another Rate Cut, Powell Says December Further Cut Not Guaranteed**\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve announced on October 29, 2025, a 25-basis-point reduction in the federal funds rate target range to 3.75%\u20134.00%, marking the fifth consecutive rate cut since September 2024. The Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) stated that economic activity has been expanding at a moderate pace, with slowing job growth, a slight rise in unemployment, and inflation remaining elevated despite some increase since the beginning of the year. The decision to cut rates was based on a shift in risk balance. Chairman Jerome Powell emphasized that further rate cuts at the December meeting are not guaranteed, noting that the ongoing federal government shutdown continues to pressure economic activity, though these effects are expected to reverse after the shutdown ends. The shutdown delayed the release of key economic data, but pre-shutdown data suggested stronger-than-expected economic growth. Powell stressed that the Fed faces a delicate balance between controlling inflation and achieving full employment, with no clearly safe policy path. Of the 12 FOMC members, 10 voted to cut rates by 25 basis points, one (Stephen Miller) favored a 50-basis-point cut, and one (Jeffrey Schmid) voted to hold rates steady. Analysts suggest that while inflation remains above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, employment has become the primary focus. Morgan Stanley predicts the Fed will continue cutting rates through January 2026, with two additional cuts in April and July 2026, bringing the target range down to 3.00%\u20133.25%. Franklin Templeton Investment, however, expects inflation concerns to limit the pace of cuts, with the final target range potentially ending above 3.5%.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[news.cn](http://www.news.cn/world/20251030/a81c1454c601480db1d772b318c531c4/c.html)\n\n**Fed Vice Chair Bowman Calls for Decisive Rate Cuts to Protect Labor Market**\nU.S. Federal Reserve Vice Chair Michelle Bowman said on Friday that the Fed must act decisively and early to cut rates to guard against worsening labor\u2011market conditions. She noted that recent data show labor\u2011market vulnerability has risen sharply and that, even after removing tariff effects, inflation remains close to the Fed\u2019s 2% target. Bowman warned that the Fed is at serious risk of falling behind in addressing labor\u2011market deterioration and that if the situation persists, policy may need to be adjusted more quickly and at larger scale. The Fed\u2019s most recent policy meeting lowered the federal\u2011funds target range by 25 basis points to 4.00%\u20114.25%. Bowman and most colleagues voted for the 25\u2011basis\u2011point cut, while new board member Stephen M. Milei had pushed for a 50\u2011basis\u2011point cut. Bowman also said she prefers a smaller balance\u2011sheet, keeping reserves near scarce levels, and that the Fed should maintain a short\u2011term Treasury\u2011only balance\u2011sheet with flexibility to shift to longer\u2011dated bonds if needed. She expressed interest in raising the standing repo facility (SRF) floor rate above the upper bound of the federal\u2011funds target range to keep the tool as a last\u2011resort liquidity buffer. She said, 'I prefer to set the SRF floor rate above the upper bound of the federal\u2011funds target range to emphasize that the SRF is a last\u2011resort tool, not a routine source of financing.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: September 26, 2025 07:27 PM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202509273525137543.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
