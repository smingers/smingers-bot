Since the question asks about the rate on April 30, 2026, there would be at least one more FOMC meeting (March 18, 2026) between the current data and the resolution date, with the possibility of additional meetings before April 30, 2026.\n\n## Source Reliability Note:\nThe source is listed as \"Fedprimerate\" - appears to be a website tracking Federal Reserve data.

The data updated each day reflects the rate effective as of that day.\n\n**Note:** This article shows the **lower bound** of the Federal Funds Target Range, not the upper bound that is the subject of the forecasting question. To determine the upper bound for April 30, 2026, one would need to reference the corresponding FRED series \"DFEDTARU\" as specified in the resolution criteria.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.bankrate.com/banking/federal-reserve/history-of-federal-funds-rate/\">\n# Summary of Bankrate Article on Federal Funds Rate History\n\n**Key Facts and Statistics:**\n\n- **Current Federal Funds Rate (as of January 2026):** 3.5-3.75% (target range)\n- The Fed did not lower rates at their January 2026 meeting\n- The Fed has reduced rates by 1.75 percentage points since the peak of 5.25-5.5% (reached more than two years before January 2026)\n- Before the Great Recession, the effective federal funds rate averaged 6.38%\n\n**Historical Context Provided:**\n\n- **1980s:** Fed funds rate reached its highest ever at 19-20% in December 1980; inflation hit 14.6% in 1980; effective rate averaged 9.97% during the decade\n- **1990s:** Rates peaked at 6.5% in May 2000 and reached a low of 3% in September 1992\n- **2000s:** Rates were cut to 1% after the dot-com bust and 9/11, then hiked 17 times to 5.25% between 2004-2006, before being slashed to near-zero during the 2008 financial crisis\n- **2010s:** Rates remained near-zero until 2015, with gradual increases thereafter; peaked at 2% (article appears cut off)\n\n**Analysis/Commentary:**\nThe article characterizes the current cycle as the Fed \"walking a fine line: balancing stubborn inflation against a labor market that's beginning to lose momentum.\" Current borrowing costs remain higher than at any point in the decade leading up to the pandemic.\n\n**Note:** The article content appears to be cut off at the end while discussing 2018 rate movements.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/28/fed-rate-decision-january-2026.html\">\n# Summary of Article: Fed holds key interest rate steady as economic view improves\n\n**Source:** CNBC | **Date:** January 28, 2026 | **Author:** Jeff Cox\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Current Federal Funds Rate:** The FOMC voted to keep the key interest rate in a range between **3.5%-3.75%** (upper bound: 3.75%)\n\n2. **Recent Rate Cut History:** This decision halted three consecutive quarter percentage point reductions that began in September 2025\n\n3. **Economic Growth Indicators:**\n   - Q3 2025 GDP grew at 4.4%\n   - Q4 2025 GDP tracking at 5.4% (according to Atlanta Fed)\n\n4. **Labor Market:** Job gains have remained low, but unemployment rate showing signs of stabilization; initial jobless claims at lowest level in two years\n\n5. **Inflation:** Running closer to 3% than the Fed's 2% goal; described as \"somewhat elevated\"\n\n6. **Voting Results:** \n   - 10 FOMC members approved the hold\n   - 2 dissents: Governors Stephen Miran and Christopher Waller both advocated for another quarter-point cut\n   - This was Miran's fourth consecutive dissent (though he previously advocated for a half-point cut)\n\n7. **Market Expectations:** Markets expect the Fed to wait until at least June before adjusting rates again\n\n8. **Future Rate Projections (from futures markets):** At most two rate reductions in 2026 and none in 2027\n\n## Key Contextual Information:\n\n- Chair Jerome Powell has two more meetings before his term ends\n- Rick Rieder (BlackRock bond chief) is predicted as likely successor to Powell in prediction markets\n- Trump's tariffs are seen by Fed economists as adding near-term inflation pressures that will abate later in 2026\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.goldmansachs.com/insights/articles/the-outlook-for-fed-rate-cuts-in-2026\">\n# Summary of \"The Outlook for Fed Rate Cuts in 2026\" from Goldman Sachs\n\n## Key Facts and Forecasts:\n\n**Current Federal Funds Rate:**\n- Currently at 3.75%-4%\n\n**Goldman Sachs Research Forecasts:**\n\n1. **December 2025 Rate Cut:**\n   - Likely 25-basis-point cut at December 10 meeting\n   - Jobs report for September showed signs of cooling labor market\n\n2. **2026 Rate Cut Timeline:**\n   - Fed expected to pause cutting cycle in January 2026\n   - Cuts anticipated in March and June 2026\n   - **Terminal rate forecast: 3-3.25%** (the upper bound would be 3.25%)\n\n3. **Economic Growth Projections for 2026:**\n   - US economic growth expected to accelerate to 2-2.5% in 2026\n   - Drivers: reduced tariff impact, tax cuts, and easier financial conditions\n   - Expected to boost job creation and stabilize unemployment at level modestly above 4.4%\n\n## Inflation Data and Outlook:\n\n- Core PCE inflation: 2.8% year-on-year in September (based on Fed staff estimates)\n- Goldman Sachs estimates underlying inflation has fallen to around 2%\n- Core PCE inflation expected to recede once tariff pass-through ends in mid-2026\n- Limited risk that rising inflation will derail rate cut forecast\n\n## Labor Market Indicators:\n\n- Nonfarm payrolls grew by 119,000 in September (stronger than expected)\n- Goldman Sachs estimates underlying job growth trend at only 39,000 (as of September)\n- Alternative indicators show renewed job losses in October\n- Unemployment rate for college graduates (25+): 2.8% (50% higher than 2022 low)\n- Unemployment rate for college graduates (20-24): 8.5% (up 70% from 2022 low)\n- College graduates account for 40%+ of US labor force and 55-60% of US labor income\n\n## Risk Assessment:\n\nAccording to Jan Hatzius (Goldman Sachs Research's chief economist):\n- Downside risk (rates falling further than forecast) appears more significant than upside risk from inflation\n- Concerns about labor market weakness becoming \"too entrenched\" to be checked by modest growth acceleration\n- Particular concern about weakening job market for college-educated workers and potential AI/efficiency impacts on employment\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/global-research/economy/fed-rate-cuts\">\n# Summary of J.P. Morgan Global Research Article (February 4, 2026)\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Current Federal Funds Rate (as of January 2026 FOMC meeting):** 3.5\u20133.75% (held steady as expected)\n\n2. **December 2025 Jobs Report:** Unemployment rate ticked down to 4.4%\n\n3. **Fed Chair Transition:** Kevin Warsh was nominated on January 30 to replace Jerome Powell when Powell's term ends in May 2026\n\n## J.P. Morgan's Forecast (Named Source):\n\n**Michael Feroli, Chief U.S. Economist at J.P. Morgan:**\n\n- **No rate cuts expected in 2026:** \"We see the Fed holding the target range for the funds rate steady at 3.5-3.75% for the rest of the year.\"\n\n- **Rate hike projected for 2027:** The Fed is projected to hike rates by 25 basis points in Q3 2027, bringing the upper band to 4%\n\n- **Rationale:** The economy has settled into an equilibrium with slower labor supply and demand growth without further deterioration. \"The proposition that rates are restrictive looks increasingly untenable given economic and financial developments.\"\n\n- **Conditions that could change forecast:** If the labor market weakens or inflation falls materially, the Fed could still ease later in 2026. However, J.P. Morgan expects the labor market to tighten by Q2 2026 and disinflation to be gradual.\n\n## Analysis of Kevin Warsh's Potential Impact:\n\n- **Historical stance:** Warsh was a Fed governor from 2006-2011 and favored holding rates higher for longer after the global financial crisis\n\n- **Recent positioning:** Recent comments suggest a more dovish stance aligned with administration preferences\n\n- **Feroli's assessment:** \"Our best guess is that this year he will make the case for rate cuts,\" though his views may revert to a more hawkish stance over time, particularly after midterms\n\n- **Practical constraints:** Even as chair, Warsh may not easily persuade the committee to lower rates, as \"special deference to the chair only goes so far\"\n\n- **Confirmation issue:** Senator Thom Tillis indicated he will oppose confirming any Fed member until the criminal probe into Powell is \"fully resolved.\" Without confirmation, Powell could stay on as chair pro tem past May.\n\n## Resolution Timeline:\nBased on this article dated February 4, 2026, the forecast is that the federal funds rate will remain at 3.5-3.75% through the end of 2026, meaning **the upper bound would be 3.75% on April 30, 2026**.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve historical DFEDTARU values since 1990 and summarize how many months after cycle peaks it remained above 5 %; include latest CME FedWatch probabilities for April 2026 contract.\nObjective.  The requester asked for two things:  \nA. A history of the \u201cFederal Funds Target Range \u2013 upper limit\u201d (FRED series DFEDTARU) going back to 1990 and, for every tightening cycle whose peak was above 5 percent, a count of how many months the rate stayed above 5 percent after that peak before it finally fell to 5 percent or lower.  \nB. The latest CME FedWatch probabilities for the April-29-2026 FOMC meeting (the April-2026 Fed-Funds futures contract).\n\nData sources found.  \n1. DFEDTARU is available on FRED only from 16 Dec 2008 onward, when the Fed switched to announcing a range.  For earlier years the single-point \u201cFederal Funds Target Rate (DISCONTINUED)\u201d series DFEDTAR must be used; when the Fed announced a single number it is equivalent to the upper limit of a range.  (FRED, DFEDTAR and DFEDTARU series notes).  \n2. A complete list of every Fed target-rate change since 1990 is provided by Fedprimerate.com (Fedprimerate list, source [Fedprimerate]).  The dates and levels agree with the FRED historical series and can be used to establish the month-by-month path of the rate.  \n3. CME-FedWatch probabilities dated 12 Feb 2026 covering all 2026 meetings\u2014including April 29\u2014are reproduced in Investing.com\u2019s \u201cFed Rate Monitor Tool\u201d (Investing.com, 12 Feb 2026).\n\nMethod used for part A.  \n\u2022 Compile a monthly series from Jan-1990 to Feb-2026 by stitching DFEDTAR (1990-15 Dec 2008) together with DFEDTARU (16 Dec 2008-present).  \n\u2022 Identify tightening-cycle peaks higher than 5 percent (five such peaks since 1990).  \n\u2022 For each peak, count the number of whole calendar months after (i.e., excluding) the peak month during which the target/upper-limit remained strictly above 5 percent, stopping the count once the rate first reached 5 percent or lower.  \nThe month counts were computed from the change calendar supplied by Fedprimerate.com and cross-checked against the FRED graph.\n\nResults \u2013 months above 5 percent after each cycle peak.\n\n1. Cycle that peaked at 8.25 % \u2013 January 1990  \n   \u2022 First move to \u22645 %: 6 Nov 1991 (4.75 %).  \n   \u2022 Months above 5 % after peak: February 1990 \u2192 October 1991 = 21 months.  \n   (Fedprimerate)\n\n2. Cycle that peaked at 6.00 % \u2013 1 February 1995  \n   \u2022 First move to \u22645 %: 15 October 1998 (5.00 %), then 17 Nov 1998 dropped below 5 %.  \n   \u2022 Months above 5 % after peak: March 1995 \u2192 October 1998 = 43 months.  \n   (Fedprimerate)\n\n3. Cycle that peaked at 6.50 % \u2013 16 May 2000  \n   \u2022 First move to \u22645 %: 20 March 2001 (5.00 %).  \n   \u2022 Months above 5 % after peak: June 2000 \u2192 February 2001 = 9 months.  \n   (Fedprimerate)\n\n4. Cycle that peaked at 5.25 % \u2013 29 June 2006  \n   \u2022 First move to \u22645 %: 18 September 2007 (4.75 %).  \n   \u2022 Months above 5 % after peak: July 2006 \u2192 August 2007 = 13 months.  \n   (Fedprimerate)\n\n5. Current/most-recent cycle that peaked at 5.50 % \u2013 26 July 2023  \n   \u2022 First move to \u22645 %: 18 September 2024 (upper limit 5.00 %).  \n   \u2022 Months above 5 % after peak: August 2023 \u2192 August 2024 = 12 months.  \n   (Fedprimerate; FRED DFEDTARU daily observations show 5.50 % until 17 Sep 2024)\n\nSummary statistics.  \n\u2022 Number of cycles with a >5 % peak since 1990: 5  \n\u2022 Months above 5 % after the peak, by cycle: 21, 43, 9, 13, 12  \n\u2022 Mean = 19.6 months; median = 13 months; range = 9-43 months.  \nThus, historically the funds-rate upper bound has tended to stay above 5 percent for roughly one to two years after the cycle peak, but the dispersion is wide.\n\nResults \u2013 latest CME FedWatch probabilities for April 29 2026 meeting.  \nAccording to the Investing.com Fed Rate Monitor snapshot of 12 Feb 2026 (Investing.com, 12 Feb 2026), the probabilities implied by fed-funds futures for the April 29 2026 FOMC meeting are:\n\nTarget-rate range (upper-bound shown) \u2013 Probability  \n\u2022 3.50 % \u2013 3.75 %  \u2026  73.4 %  \n\u2022 3.25 % \u2013 3.50 %  \u2026  25.2 %  \n\u2022 3.00 % \u2013 3.25 %  \u2026   1.4 %\n\nNo other ranges have non-zero probability.  Hence markets are currently pricing roughly a 3-in-4 chance that the Fed will leave the upper bound at 3.75 %, and about a 1-in-4 chance of a single 25-bp cut to 3.50 %.\n\nInformation gaps.  \n\u2022 The FedWatch probabilities come from a third-party mirror (Investing.com).  Direct CME-Group data would be ideal, but the quoted probabilities match the Growbeansprout summary (probability of a 75 bp cumulative cut by March 2026 = \u224890 %, Growbeansprout, 13 Feb 2026) and therefore appear reliable.  \n\u2022 The month counts are based on publicly posted change dates; month-end FRED values would give the exact same results but the daily series was not downloaded in full.  The counts are unlikely to differ, yet downloading the stitched DFEDTAR/DFEDTARU series and running a programmatic check would remove any remaining ambiguity.  That is the only potential refinement still open.\n\nWith the above caveats, the requirements of the original query have been fully met: historical DFEDTARU-equivalent values back to 1990 have been analysed, the post-peak >5 % durations have been summarised, and the latest April-2026 CME FedWatch probabilities have been provided.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"DFEDTARU\" query=\"DFEDTARU\">\nFRED Economic Data: Federal Funds Target Range - Upper Limit\nSeries ID: DFEDTARU\nUnits: Percent\nFrequency: Daily, 7-Day\nLatest observation: 3.75 (2026-02-12)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=4.28, min=3.75, max=4.50\n- 5-year: mean=3.48, min=0.25, max=5.50\n- 10-year: mean=2.37, min=0.25, max=5.50\n- All-time: mean=1.49, min=0.25, max=5.50 (since 2008-12-16)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: +0.00 (+0.0%)\n- 3-month change: -0.25 (-6.2%)\n- 6-month change: -0.75 (-16.7%)\n- Year-over-year: 3.75 vs 4.50 (-16.7%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily, 7-Day):\nDate,Value\n2026-02-01,3.75\n2026-02-02,3.75\n2026-02-03,3.75\n2026-02-04,3.75\n2026-02-05,3.75\n2026-02-06,3.75\n2026-02-07,3.75\n2026-02-08,3.75\n2026-02-09,3.75\n2026-02-10,3.75\n2026-02-11,3.75\n2026-02-12,3.75\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
