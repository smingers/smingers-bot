## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Month-to-month price changes in jet fuel (Gulf Coast, recent years)**
   - Suitability: High - directly comparable timeframe and product
   - From FRED data: Recent 1-month changes range from -$0.19 to +$0.27
   - Historical volatility: 30% annualized (~8.7% monthly)

2. **Q1 seasonal patterns in jet fuel pricing**
   - Suitability: Medium-high - captures seasonal effects
   - Q1 typically sees lower demand (post-holiday travel), but also refinery maintenance season
   - Historical Q1 months (2015-2025) show mixed patterns

3. **Forecasts vs. actual outcomes for 1-month forward jet fuel prices**
   - Suitability: High - directly tests forecast accuracy
   - Would need historical forecast data vs. actuals to quantify
   - Agent report suggests current forward curve/forecasts cluster $2.07-$2.20

4. **Probability of 18%+ price increase within 1 month in jet fuel markets**
   - Suitability: Very high - directly addresses the question
   - Need to calculate: ($2.50 - $2.12) / $2.12 = 17.9% increase needed
   - From historical data, such moves are rare but not unprecedented

**Selected Reference Class:** Month-to-month price movements in Gulf Coast jet fuel, specifically examining the frequency of 18%+ increases.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 
- Current date: February 13, 2026
- Target period: March 2026 (entire month average)
- Effective timeframe: ~2-6 weeks (mid-February through end of March)

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**

From Agent Report monthly data (2015-2026):
- Examining month-over-month changes where price increased ≥18%:
  - Feb 2022 → Mar 2022: $2.54 → $3.20 (+26%)
  - Mar 2022 → Apr 2022: $3.20 → $5.07 (+58%)
  - Apr 2020 → May 2020: $0.67 → $0.62 (decrease)
  - Looking at all 132 month-to-month transitions in the dataset

From FRED weekly data (recent 3 months):
- Largest weekly increase: Nov 21 → Nov 28: $2.34 → $2.07 (decrease)
- Week of Jan 9: $1.87 → Week of Jan 16: $2.02 (+8%)
- Week of Jan 16: $2.02 → Week of Jan 23: $2.10 (+4%)
- Week of Jan 23: $2.10 → Week of Jan 30: $2.18 (+3.8%)
- Recent volatility shows moves of $0.08-$0.15 per week

**Key Observations:**
1. Current price ($2.12 as of Feb 6) needs to reach $2.50+ average for March
2. If March started immediately, would need sustained prices above $2.50 for entire month
3. Since we're mid-February, early March prices will partially determine the average
4. Recent trend shows prices in $1.87-$2.34 range over past 3 months
5. Major price spikes (>18% in one month) occurred during:
   - COVID recovery (2020-2021)
   - Russia-Ukraine war onset (Feb-Apr 2022)
   - Supply disruptions

## (d) Justification

**Factors Supporting Lower Probability (<30%):**

1. **Current Market Consensus:** All forward-looking indicators (EIA STEO, CME futures, TradingEconomics, Argus) cluster at $2.07-$2.20 for Q1-2026, significantly below $2.50

2. **Recent Price Trajectory:** Current spot price ($2.12-$2.165) is 17.9% below the $2.50 threshold. The recent 3-month trend shows prices declining from $2.34 peak to current levels.

3. **Structural Factors:** Deloitte analysis indicates refining margins under pressure, with 50% decline from 2022 peaks. Brent crude forecast at $50-60/bbl suggests moderate crude input costs.

4. **Time Constraint:** With only ~2 weeks until March begins, any price increase must be both rapid and sustained throughout the month to achieve a >$2.50 average.

5. **Historical Rarity:** Examining the monthly data, 18%+ month-over-month increases are rare outside of major supply shocks (Ukraine war, COVID recovery). No such shock is currently evident.

**Factors Supporting Higher Probability (>10%):**

1. **Historical Volatility:** 30% annualized volatility means large moves are possible. The $1.87-$2.34 range over past 3 months shows $0.47 swing capability.

2. **Refinery Disruptions:** Alaska Air article mentioned "ongoing refinery disruptions" in Q3 2025. Similar disruptions could tighten supply.

3. **Strong Crack Spreads:** OilPrice.com article cites EIA and Rystad forecasting higher crack spreads in 2026, which could support higher jet fuel prices relative to crude.

4. **Seasonal Factors:** Late winter/early spring can see refinery maintenance, potentially tightening supply.

5. **Geopolitical Risk:** Oil markets remain subject to geopolitical shocks (Middle East tensions, production cuts, etc.)

6. **Recent Uptick:** Price increased from $1.87 (Jan 9) to $2.18 (Jan 30), showing upward momentum before recent pullback.

**Base Rate Calculation:**

From historical monthly data (2015-2026, 132 months):
- Months where price >$2.50: Apr-Aug 2022 (5 months), plus scattered months in 2018-2019, 2023
- Approximately 15-20 months out of 132 exceeded $2.50
- Base rate: ~11-15% of months

However, this doesn't account for:
- Starting position ($2.12 vs. historical distribution)
- Forward curve information (currently pointing lower)
- Conditional probability given current price level

**Conditional Analysis:**

Given current price of $2.12, need 17.9% increase. Examining historical data:
- Months with 15-20% increases: Very rare outside 2020-2022 period
- In stable periods (2015-2019, 2023-2026), such increases essentially never occurred
- In volatile periods (2020-2022), occurred ~5-10% of the time

Current market conditions appear more similar to stable period (2023-2026) than volatile period (2020-2022).

Outside view calibration:

**Calibration Factors:**

1. **Market Consensus Anchor:** Four independent sources (EIA, CME, TradingEconomics, Argus) all forecast $2.07-$2.20 for March 2026. These are sophisticated forecasters with access to supply/demand models. Their consensus should carry significant weight.

2. **Required Move Size:** 17.9% increase needed. In the 2023-2026 "stable" period, no single month showed such an increase. Even in 2015-2019, such moves were absent.

3. **Tail Risk Premium:** While the base case strongly suggests <$2.50, oil markets have fat tails. Geopolitical events, refinery accidents, or weather disruptions could cause rapid price spikes. Historical data shows ~2-3% of months saw unexpected large moves.

4. **Time Decay:** We're already mid-February. If prices remain near $2.12 for the next 2 weeks, March would need to average ~$2.55+ to achieve a monthly average >$2.50. This compounds the difficulty.

5. **Asymmetric Information:** Forward curves and professional forecasts incorporate more information than historical patterns alone. The CME futures market (though thinly traded) settling at $2.07 suggests sophisticated traders see low probability of $2.50+.

6. **Recent Trend:** The decline from $2.34 (late November) to $2.12 (early February) suggests downward momentum, not upward.

**Probability Estimation:**

- Base case (market consensus correct): ~85-90% probability → Price stays $2.07-$2.20
- Moderate upside scenario (refinery issues, stronger demand): ~7-10% probability → Price reaches $2.30-$2.45
- Tail scenario (major supply disruption): ~2-5% probability → Price exceeds $2.50

The question asks specifically for >$2.50, which falls entirely in the tail scenario.

**Calibration Against Historical Upset Rate:**

In commodity markets, 1-month forward forecasts are typically accurate within ±10-15%. A miss of 17.9%+ would be a significant upset. Historical analysis suggests such upsets occur ~2-3% of the time in stable market conditions, rising to ~8-10% in volatile conditions.

Current conditions (stable crude prices, no apparent supply shocks, declining recent trend) suggest we're in a stable regime.

**Final Calibration:**

Given:
- Strong consensus at $2.07-$2.20 (well below threshold)
- 17.9% increase required
- Stable market conditions
- Historical rarity of such moves in current regime
- Downward recent momentum
- Only 2 weeks until March begins

But acknowledging:
- Oil markets have fat tails
- Refinery disruptions possible
- Geopolitical risks exist
- Historical volatility allows for large moves

My calibrated probability accounts for the very low base case but includes appropriate tail risk premium for unexpected supply disruptions or geopolitical events.
