## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Month-to-month price changes (1-month forward):**
   - Suitability: High - we're forecasting March 2026 from mid-February 2026 baseline
   - Historical pattern: FRED data shows typical monthly volatility of ~5-15%
   - Current: $2.12/gal (Feb 6), need to reach >$2.50/gal (+18% increase)

2. **Q1 seasonal patterns:**
   - Suitability: Moderate - March is end of Q1, typically lower demand period
   - Historical: Q1 months generally show stable-to-declining prices vs Q4
   - Pattern: No strong seasonal spike in March historically

3. **Forward curve accuracy:**
   - Suitability: High - multiple forward indicators available
   - Current signals: All point to $2.05-$2.20/gal range for March 2026
   - Historical accuracy: Futures/forecasts typically within 10-15% of realized prices

4. **Threshold exceedance rate (>$2.50/gal):**
   - Suitability: Highest - directly relevant to binary question
   - Historical frequency: From FRED monthly data (2015-2026):
     - Months >$2.50: 21 out of 133 months (15.8%)
     - Concentrated in 2022-2023 (Ukraine war period)
     - Since Jan 2024: 0 out of 25 months exceeded $2.50

**Selected Reference Class:** Month-to-month price movements from current baseline, combined with forward curve indicators and threshold exceedance patterns.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 
- Today: February 13, 2026
- Target month: March 2026 (starts in 15 days)
- Resolution: Monthly average for March 2026

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**

From FRED monthly data (last 24 months):
- Feb 2024: $2.32 → Mar 2024: $2.40 (+3.4%)
- Feb 2025: $2.04 → Mar 2025: $2.11 (+3.4%)
- Current Feb 2026: ~$2.12 (partial month)

**Recent volatility (past 3 months):**
- November 2025: $2.18/gal
- December 2025: $1.92/gal (-11.9%)
- January 2026: $2.02/gal (+5.2%)
- Early February 2026: $2.12/gal (+5.0%)

**To reach >$2.50/gal threshold:**
- Required increase from current $2.12: +18%
- Largest 1-month increase in past 24 months: +11.1% (Jan 2026)
- Standard deviation of monthly changes (2024-2025): ~8%
- A +18% move would be >2 standard deviations

## (d) Justification

**Baseline Assessment:**
Current spot price is $2.12/gal (Feb 6, 2026), approximately $0.38 below the $2.50 threshold. This represents an 18% gap that would need to close within the next 2-3 weeks for the March monthly average to exceed $2.50.

**Forward Indicators Consensus:**
All available forward-looking indicators point to March 2026 prices in the $2.05-$2.20 range:
- EIA STEO Q1-2026: ~$2.10/gal
- CME futures (Mar-26): $2.07/gal
- TradingEconomics: ~$2.15/gal
- Argus base case: $2.10-$2.20/gal

These represent a consensus view from official forecasters, market participants, and industry analysts. None suggest prices approaching $2.50.

**Structural Factors:**
Positive pressure (supporting higher prices):
- EIA and Rystad forecast higher crack spreads in 2026 vs 2025
- Tight refining capacity and supply constraints
- Steady distillate demand

Negative pressure (limiting price increases):
- Brent crude forecasted at $50-60/bbl (relatively low)
- Refining margins already stabilized after 50% decline from 2022 peak
- No immediate supply shocks evident
- Recent trend shows prices declining from Nov 2025 peak of $2.34

**Historical Context:**
- Since January 2024 (25 months), Gulf Coast jet fuel has not exceeded $2.50/gal in any month
- Last time >$2.50: December 2023 and earlier (during post-Ukraine war elevated pricing)
- Current price environment appears structurally lower than 2022-2023 period
- Threshold exceedance rate historically: 15.8% overall, but 0% in recent 25 months

**Required Scenario for YES:**
For March 2026 average to exceed $2.50, we would need:
1. An immediate price spike of 18%+ that sustains through March, OR
2. A gradual climb starting now reaching ~$2.60+ by mid-March to pull monthly average above $2.50

Neither scenario is supported by:
- Current forward curves
- Expert forecasts
- Structural supply/demand balance
- Recent price momentum (sideways-to-down since Nov 2025 peak)
- Absence of visible catalysts for major disruption

**Potential Upset Scenarios:**
- Major refinery outage in Gulf Coast
- Geopolitical shock affecting crude supply
- Unexpected demand surge
- Severe weather disrupting production/distribution

However, even during recent volatility (Jan 2026), the maximum observed was $2.27/gal—still well below $2.50.

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring to Available Data:**
- Current price: $2.12/gal
- Gap to threshold: $0.38 (18% increase needed)
- Forward curve consensus: $2.07-$2.20/gal range
- Historical threshold exceedance: 0% in past 25 months

**Probability Calibration:**

The question requires the March 2026 monthly average to exceed $2.50/gal. Given:

1. **Base rate consideration:** In the current price regime (2024-present), 0 out of 25 months exceeded $2.50. This suggests a low base rate of 0-5% in current market conditions.

2. **Forward indicators:** All four independent forward-looking sources (EIA, CME, TradingEconomics, Argus) point to $2.05-$2.20, implying market consensus sees <5% probability of reaching $2.50.

3. **Statistical requirement:** An 18% increase from current levels would be a >2-sigma event based on recent volatility patterns. In a normal distribution, events >2 sigma occur ~2.5% of the time.

4. **Time constraint:** With only 15 days until March begins, there's limited time for a sustained price movement to pull the monthly average above $2.50. Even if prices spiked to $2.50 on March 1, they'd need to average significantly higher throughout the month.

5. **Upset potential:** While refinery disruptions or geopolitical shocks could cause spikes, the recent maximum (Jan 2026) was $2.27—still $0.23 below threshold. A shock would need to be more severe than recent volatility.

**Calibrated Assessment:**
- Scenario probability for reaching >$2.50: 3-5%
- This reflects: very low base rate in current regime, consensus forecasts well below threshold, statistical improbability of required move, limited time for sustained increase
- Not 0-1% because: tail risks exist (refinery outages, geopolitical shocks), energy markets can be volatile
- Not 10%+ because: no current indicators support this, would require unprecedented move in current regime
