Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Resolves **Yes** if the EIA-reported **monthly average** of “U.S. Gulf Coast Jet Fuel Spot Price FOB” for **March 2026** is **strictly > $2.500/gal**; otherwise **No**.

(a) Source analysis (quality, date, what’s factual vs opinion)

- **YCharts (Feb 11, 2026 update; data as of Feb 9, 2026)**  
  High-quality *aggregator* of EIA series. Factual: spot price about **$2.165/gal** and recent range roughly **$1.82–$2.28** in Jan 2026. No forecast offered.

- **EIA series page (definition/resolution source)**  
  Highest reliability for settlement (official data). Mostly definitional / data access; no forward-looking content.

- **FRED series description (DJFUELUSGULF)**  
  High reliability (EIA via FRED). Mostly metadata/series access; not itself a forecast.

- **Aviationweek (2026 outlook; date not explicitly given here but clearly recent)**  
  Trade publication; generally solid. Contains identifiable institutional view (IATA-related commentary). Factual claim/forecast: **jet fuel ~$88/bbl in 2026** and crude around **$62/bbl** (forecast). This is a forecast/opinion but from identifiable industry bodies.

- **NASDAQ/IEA-demand-forecast article (Feb 12, 2026)**  
  Medium-high quality as a market news summary. Factual: **WTI fell to ~$62.66** and IEA projects a **large 2026 supply surplus (~3.7 mb/d)**; notes **OPEC+ meeting March 1**. Some geopolitical discussion is interpretive; core numbers are attributable.

- **NJ.com Venezuela piece (Jan 31, 2026)**  
  Regional outlet but with attributable figures and a bank forecast (JP Morgan). Key relevant factual claim: near-term **plentiful refined product supply through 2026**, and Venezuela production recovery is **slow**. Some narrative/color is opinion.

- **Gasoline-focused articles (Investopedia Feb 12; WDAM Feb 13; etc.)**  
  Generally reliable for retail gasoline context but **indirect** for Gulf Coast jet fuel wholesale. Mostly descriptive; limited predictive value for the specific threshold.

- **SAF market articles (Fastmarkets Oct 2025; Resourcewise Jan 2026)**  
  Credible sector context, but only indirectly linked to conventional jet fuel spot pricing in March 2026. Mostly qualitative; weak direct relevance.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence (pushes toward NO)
1) **Current spot level ~ $2.165/gal (Feb 9)** is far below $2.50; needs ~**+15%** sustained in March for the *monthly average* to clear $2.50. (YCharts/EIA-derived)  
2) **IEA expects a record 2026 oil supply surplus** and crude is currently ~low-$60s (NASDAQ/IEA). This is a strong macro headwind against a sharp, sustained jet fuel price jump absent a shock.

Moderate evidence (mostly toward NO; some tail-risk to YES)
3) **Industry forecast jet fuel ~$88/bbl for 2026** (Aviationweek/IATA context). Converting: $88/bbl ÷ 42 ≈ **$2.10/gal**, which is well below $2.50. (Moderate because it’s annual/average and not Gulf Coast-specific.)  
4) **OPEC+ March 1 meeting** creates event risk; could tighten supply and lift crude, but the market backdrop is surplus (NASDAQ/IEA). Net: small upward tail risk, not a central case.

Weak evidence (small adjustments either way)
5) SAF/feedstock constraints and widening crack-spread narratives could support distillate margins, but the linkage to **March 2026 Gulf Coast jet fuel average** exceeding $2.50 is indirect and timing is uncertain (Fastmarkets/Resourcewise).

Net effect: Evidence strongly supports **No**, with **tail-risk Yes** mainly from an acute geopolitical disruption or major Gulf Coast refining outage.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Today is **Feb 13, 2026**. The target month **March 2026** begins in ~**2 weeks** and spans **31 days**. Resolution occurs when EIA posts the **March monthly average** (by May 1, 2026).
- If the timeframe were **halved** (e.g., forecasting only the first half of March), the chance of a brief spike above $2.50 would be **higher** than for the *monthly average* criterion.  
- If the timeframe were **doubled** (e.g., “by end of April”), probability would rise modestly because more time allows shocks/outages to occur and persist—but the question is specifically March average, which is harder to move with a short-lived spike.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside view)
Outside view base rate given: **4%**.

Status quo: prices around **$2.10–$2.20/gal** with crude ~**$60–$65/bbl** and a macro narrative of 2026 surplus. Under “nothing major changes,” March averages near current levels and does **not** reach $2.50.

What would need to happen for YES:
- A sustained move to roughly **$2.55–$2.70/gal** for much of March (because early/late March days below $2.50 would drag the average down), likely driven by:
  - A sharp crude rally (e.g., Strait of Hormuz / Iran escalation), and/or
  - A significant Gulf Coast refining disruption tightening jet/diesel supply.

Inside-view update: Compared with the outside view, current news shows **some geopolitical tension** (U.S.–Iran rhetoric, carrier deployment talk) and an **OPEC+ decision point** on March 1—both increase tail risk slightly. However, the **market reaction is currently bearish** (crude slumping on IEA surplus), which argues that traders are not pricing a near-term spike as the central path.

So I move slightly upward from 4% to reflect nonzero event risk, but keep it low because the required jump is large and must persist for a monthly average.

Probability calibration
- Outside view: **4%**
- Adjustments:
  - +2 pts for near-term event risk (OPEC+ meeting; elevated Iran/Venezuela tensions) that could plausibly lift crude and jet cracks quickly.
  - -1 pt because the dominant macro signal (IEA surplus + current crude selloff) implies the market is leaning the other way and large sustained spikes are less likely.
- Inside view probability: **5%**

Checklist:
1) Criteria: March 2026 EIA monthly average Gulf Coast jet fuel spot price FOB > $2.500/gal → Yes, else No.  
2) Outside view base rate: 4%.  
3) Consistency check: “In 5 out of 100 worlds, March 2026 monthly average is > $2.50/gal.” Plausible given tail risks.  
4) Key evidence (most important):
   - Current spot about $2.165/gal, well below $2.50 (EIA-derived/YCharts).
   - IEA projects large 2026 oil surplus; crude around low-$60s (NASDAQ/IEA).
   - Aviationweek/IATA-type forecast implies ~ $2.10/gal jet fuel (barrel-to-gallon conversion).
   - March 1 OPEC+ decision/geopolitical shocks are the main plausible upside catalyst (event risk).
5) Blind spot: A major Gulf Coast refinery outage or sudden Middle East supply disruption that persists through most of March could push the monthly average above $2.50; that would materially raise probability (perhaps into the 15–25% range).  
6) Status quo outcome: Stable-to-modestly seasonal movement around ~$2.1–$2.3 suggests “No” is the default.

Probability: 5%
