Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Y-Charts (11 Feb 26): Reprints EIA daily jet-fuel spot price; shows US GC at $2.165 / gal. Good factual, very current, no opinion.  
2. FRED series page (continually updated): Same EIA data, confirms present price level, nothing forward-looking; very reliable facts.  
3. AviationWeek outlook (Jan 26): IATA forecast of 2026 jet-fuel at $88 / bbl (≈$2.10 / gal) and crude at $62 / bbl. Identifiable experts; moderate-quality forward view.  
4. NASDAQ newswire (12 Feb 26): WTI down to $62.7 / bbl after IEA report showing 3.7 Mb/d 2026 surplus. Reliable price quotation; IEA is strong factual/forecast source.  
5. GasBuddy / EIA gasoline pieces (Jan–Feb 26): Give context of broad US fuels staying low; analysts (De Haan) expect only seasonal rise into spring.   Credible but indirect.  
6. Historical monthly averages 2015-Jan 26 (collated from FRED): Show $2.50-plus months 23/132 (17.4 %); March 2/11 (18.2 %). Pure facts.  
7. Forward indicators (STEO Feb 26 Q1 forecast ≈$2.10; CME March-26 futures ≈$2.07). Exchange data = strong factual forward evidence.  
8. Geopolitics articles (Iran, Venezuela, refinery issues in CA/RU/CL): Mostly opinionated narrative, weak linkage to Gulf-Coast jet fuel within next 6-7 weeks.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Present spot price $2.16 well below $2.50 (Y-Charts, FRED)  
• CME futures and EIA STEO both center near $2.1 for Mar-26  

Moderate evidence  
• IEA surplus forecast and WTI <$65 suggest subdued crude baseline  
• AviationWeek/IATA expect only –2 % jet fuel yr/yr, indicating no big spike  

Weak evidence  
• Headlines on US–Iran tensions or refinery closures outside Gulf Coast  
• Seasonal spring uptick commentary (GasBuddy)—small, noisy effect

(c) Timeframe analysis  
47 days until first March trade, 78 days until full monthly average known.  
If the horizon were halved (≈24 days), probability drops a couple of points: too little time for a 15 %+ sustained jump.  
If doubled (≈94 days), probability rises modestly (to ~14 %) because hurricane season etc. could intrude.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Base rate (2015-25) for “month > $2.50” = 17-18 %.  
To beat $2.50 from today’s $2.16 requires a ≈+$0.35 (+16 %) rise starting within two weeks and lasting most of March.  
• Spot/futures/agency forecasts cluster $2.05–2.15 ⇒ status-quo points well below threshold (strong evidence ↓).  
• Crack spread could widen, but refinery margins are already historically fat; IEA shows surplus, dampening crude side (moderate evidence ↓).  
• Only plausible rocket-fuel scenario is sudden Gulf-wide supply shock or domestic refinery outage—low base chance inside next 6-7 weeks (weak evidence, small ↑).  

Net effect: adjust downward from 18.9 % to about 11 %.  This leaves room for low-probability geopolitical or refinery shocks but respects hard market data pointing lower.

Probability calibration
I expect that about 11 out of 100 times a month that starts with jet fuel at $2.15 / gal and forward curve near $2.10 would nonetheless average above $2.50 because of an unforeseen, persistent shock in the next seven weeks.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will March 2026 average US Gulf Coast jet fuel exceed $2.50 / gal?”  
2. Outside-view base rate stated: 18.9 %.  
3. Consistency line – “11 out of 100 times, March 2026 would settle > $2.50.”  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each)  
   • Current spot $2.16 well below threshold.  
   • CME Mar-26 futures ~$2.07.  
   • EIA STEO Q1-26 forecast $2.10.  
   • IEA sees record 2026 crude surplus; WTI $62.  
   • Only 17 % of months since 2015 exceeded $2.50.  
5. Blind-spot – Surprise Gulf Coast refinery fire plus Iran war lifts jet fuel >$3 for weeks.  Would raise odds dramatically.  
6. Status-quo outcome (≤$2.50) favoured; nudged slightly further toward No given short horizon and soft market.

Probability: 11%
