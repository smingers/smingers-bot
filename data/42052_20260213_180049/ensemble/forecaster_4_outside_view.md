Analysis:

(a)  Source analysis  

1. EIA historical daily table (1990-1994).  
   • Factual: actual spot prices three decades ago.  
   • Opinion: none.  
   • Quality/Relevance: High quality but low relevance—the market structure and nominal price level have changed markedly since the early 1990s.  

2. YCharts page (updated 11 Feb 2026).  
   • Factual: daily spot quotes through 9 Feb 2026 (latest  $2.165 / gal).  
   • Opinion: none.  
   • Quality: Data is an automated pull from EIA; time-stamped and reliable. Highly relevant.  

3. TradingEconomics blurb (updated Feb 2026).  
   • Factual: February 2026 value $2.165 / gal; long-term high/low.  
   • Opinion: none.  
   • Quality: Mirrors Federal Reserve/EIA data; acceptable.  

4. FRED “series description” page.  
   • Factual: explains the EIA data series.  
   • Opinion: none.  
   • Quality: Authoritative but purely metadata.  

5. OilPrice.com article (15 Jan 2026).  
   • Factual: 2025/26 equity returns, EIA & Rystad comments on refining margins.  
   • Opinion: author’s narrative about stock performance.  
   • Quality: Trade press; the EIA quote is verifiable, the narrative is less central to the price forecast.  Useful for macro backdrop.  

6. FlightGlobal article (Sep 2025).  
   • Factual: Alaska Air’s Q3-2025 jet-fuel cost guidance $2.50-2.55 / gal.  
   • Opinion: airline’s explanations.  
   • Quality: Good primary source (airline disclosure) but seven months old and West-Coast specific, not Gulf Coast; limited relevance.  

7. Deloitte “2026 Oil & Gas Outlook” (late-2025).  
   • Factual: crack-spread ranges, tariff changes.  
   • Opinion: Deloitte’s interpretation of margin pressure.  
   • Quality: Reputable consultant; useful context but still five months old and not a direct price forecast.  

8. Agent report (13 Feb 2026).  
   • Factual: Reconstructed monthly averages 2015-Jan 2026; public forecasts (EIA STEO Q1-26 $≈2.10, CME Mar-26 future $≈2.07).  
   • Opinion: analyst commentary about “comfortably below $2.50.”  
   • Quality: Transparent methodology; highly relevant for historical-frequency work.  

9. FREDData weekly series extract (latest 6 Feb 2026: $2.12).  
   • Factual series data.  
   • Opinion: none.  
   • Quality: Primary data.  

(b)  Reference class analysis  

Possible reference classes:  
1. All months since 2015 (nominal prices, same series).  
2. All March months since 2015 (seasonally matched).  
3. Months in which the preceding February average was ≤ $2.50.  
4. Full 1990-2026 history (but regime changes, inflation, taxes complicate comparability).

Suitability comparison:  
• #1 offers 133 recent observations spanning multiple oil-price regimes and today’s dollar, so large enough for statistics.  
• #2 controls seasonality (jet fuel demand softens in spring) but only 11 observations—small sample.  
• #3 directly conditions on the current setup (February running below the threshold); sample still nine observations but highly pertinent.  
• #4 adds volume but mixes two very different price-level regimes (≤$1/gal common before 2000).  Less relevant to today’s dollar.

Chosen class: Combine #1 for broad base rate and #3 for conditional adjustment.

(c)  Time-frame analysis  

Time until the outcome month starts: 17 days.  
Time until the full-month average is fixed: 48 days.  
Historical 1-month percentage changes (2015-2025) for the series show a median absolute move of ≈ 6 %; the 90th percentile ≈ 18 %.  To get from 2.12 to a March average > 2.50 requires a +18 %-20 % lift sustained for the whole month—close to the extreme tail of the one-month distribution, and it has usually taken a geopolitical shock (e.g., Russia-Ukraine spring 2022) to do so.

(d)  Justification  

Base rate (2015-Jan 2026): 23 of 133 months > $2.50 ⇒ 17.3 %.  
Seasonal-match base rate (March only): 2 of 11 ⇒ 18.2 %.  

Conditional on February ≤ $2.50 (our current situation): 0 of 9 Marches cleared the bar ⇒ empirical 0 %, but with a small sample; add Laplace smoothing (1 / (9 + 2)) ⇒ 9 %.  

Put differently, when prices enter March below the line, history shows they have not crossed it the very next month in the modern (post-2014) era.

Market-based signals (although more “inside” information, still useful as an anchor for price level): STEO midpoint $2.10, CME swap $2.07.  Both stand ~17% below the trigger; neither embeds a large-shock premium.

Expert/market “upsets” rate: Oil products do experience surprises (COVID crash, Ukraine spike). Over 2015-2025, the event-driven “upset” years (2020 downside, 2022 upside) represent roughly 2 of 11 years => ≈18 % annual upset frequency.  Given only six weeks to go, the window for such a shock is much narrower than a full year; scale that to ~2.5 % (6 weeks ÷ 52 weeks × 18 %).

Combining:  
• 9 % conditional base rate  
• + ~3 % allowance for a late geopolitical/refinery upset that history has not yet captured in our limited February-to-March sample  
Gives ≈ 12 % outside-view probability.

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor: conditional historical frequency ≈ 9 %.  
• Add modest tail risk premium for unforeseen shocks → +3 %.  
• Check against “rule of rounded odds” (forecast well inside 5-95 % but not trivial).  
Therefore a calibrated outside-view probability of 12 % feels neither overconfident nor hedged.

Outside View Prediction: 12 %
