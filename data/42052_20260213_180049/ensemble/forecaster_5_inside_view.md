Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Y-Charts (11 Feb 2026). Raw EIA spot prices; reliable, factual, up-to-date.  
2. IEA Monthly Oil Report (covered in NASDAQ 12 Feb 2026 story). Credible inter-governmental forecaster; gives 3.7 mb/d surplus in 2026; factual outlook.  
3. CME Gulf-Coast jet fuel swap strip (Mar-2026 last trade 12 Feb 2026 at 207 ¢/gal; data from ICE reports). Market-based, high quality.  
4. AviationWeek (Dec 2025). IATA forecast of 2026 jet fuel $88 /bbl (≈ $2.10 /gal); expert opinion but two-month old.  
5. GasBuddy / EIA gasoline stories (Jan–Feb 2026). Show weak refined-product demand and crude ≈ $60-65; factual but secondary for jet fuel.  
6. AskNews geopolitics pieces (US–Iran tension, Venezuela seizure). Well-sourced journalism; increase tail-risk but mainly opinion on escalation likelihood.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
• Strong evidence (downward pressure)  
 – CME forward price 2.07 $/gal, 16 % below trigger.  
 – IEA supply-surplus forecast; multiple independent reports.  
• Moderate evidence (downward)  
 – Current spot 2.16 $/gal after two months <2.25.  
 – IATA $88 /bbl forecast (≈2.10 $/gal).  
• Weak–moderate evidence (upward)  
 – Heightened Gulf/Middle-East tension could spike crude; causal link real but probability unclear.  
 – U.S. refinery accident season (spring turnarounds) occasionally tightens jet fuel cracks.  

Net: strong & moderate evidence argue against breach; upward factors provide a fat-tail only.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today → first day of measurement: 16 days; full outcome known 77 days.  
If horizon were halved (8 days lead-time) probability would fall ~1 pp (less time for a spike).  
If doubled (32 days lead-time) probability would rise ~2 pp (more time for a shock).

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view base (conditional historic) = 1 %.  
Add 5 % for low but non-trivial chance of a >16 % intra-month spike from geopolitics/refinery outage (reference: Feb 2022 jump).  
Subtract 1 % because forward curve, inventories, and expert consensus are firmly bearish relative to 2022.  
Inside-view probability = ≈ 7 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that about 7 out of 100 comparable Marches that start with spot near $2.15 and a soft crude market would finish with a monthly average above $2.50.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will March 2026 USGC jet-fuel monthly average exceed $2.50/gal?  
2. Base rate stated: 8 % (historic 1 % + tail adjustment).  
3. Consistency: “7 times out of 100, the price tops $2.50.”  
4. Key evidence (20 words each)  
  a) Mar-26 futures at $2.07, far below trigger.  
  b) Current spot $2.16, needs +16 % sustained jump.  
  c) IEA projects 3.7 mb/d 2026 surplus, crude $62/bbl.  
  d) No historical case since 2015 of sub-$2.25 month preceding a >$2.50 month.  
  e) US–Iran tensions could spark supply shock.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden Strait-of-Hormuz closure driving crude +40 % and jet cracks +20 % in March. Would raise probability to ~35 %.  
6. Status-quo outcome (price remains $2.00-2.30) is “No”; nudged forecast slightly toward that.

Probability: 7%
