Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. EIA daily‐price table (1990-1994 excerpt).  Factual archival data; too old to be directly relevant.  
2. Y-Charts page (updated 11 Feb 2026).  Reprints recent EIA daily spot prices; factual, computer-generated; no opinions. Good for current level ($2.165 / gal).  
3. TradingEconomics page (Feb 2026).  Same price as Y-Charts; adds long-run min/max; forecast numbers are model-driven (opaque methodology) and should be weighted lightly.  
4. FRED metadata page.  Simply describes the EIA data series; reliable.  
5. OilPrice.com article (15 Jan 2026).  Analyst commentary on refining margins and crack spreads.  Author is a named industry reporter; opinions, but helpful background that margins are expected to stay “strong”.  No specific price forecast.  
6. FlightGlobal article (Sep 2025).  Corporate guidance for West-Coast airline jet fuel; factual but geographically different and seven months old → low weight.  
7. Deloitte 2026 Oil-&-Gas Outlook (Dec 2025).  Professional consulting report; credible macro background; no number for Gulf-coast jet fuel price.  
8. Agent report (our scrape of FRED monthly averages 2015-Jan 2026 + market-based forward indications).  Reproducible because source links are given; provides both unconditional history and four public forecasts (EIA-STEO, TradingEconomics, CME futures, Argus).  High utility.  
9. FRED weekly series (through 6 Feb 2026).  Confirms near-term level ~ $2.12 and recent volatility.  Purely factual.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
• “Any calendar month, 2015-2025” (132 obs).  Broad but ignores current starting level.  
• “Months whose preceding month averaged < $2.25” (our situation: Jan 2026 averaged $2.02).  More tailored; 101 obs in 2015-2025.  
• “Market-implied forward strip one month out” (CME swap for Mar-2026 ≈ $2.07).  Forward price embodies collective expectations, but is a single point, not a distribution.  

The second reference class captures both recency and the fact that we are starting well below the $2.50 trigger.  I adopt it for the numeric base rate and use the forward curve as a sanity check.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today: 13 Feb 2026.  The month to be measured begins in 16 days and ends in 48 days; outcome published by EIA in early May.  Historically, a one-month average can move sharply if crude spikes (e.g., Feb 2022, after Russia invaded Ukraine).  Weekly series show 8-week historical σ ≈ 8–9 % m/m.  To reach $2.50 from $2.16 requires a +16 % jump in the *month-average*, roughly a 1.8-σ event under normal volatility.

In the 101 months since 2015 where the prior-month average was below $2.25, *zero* saw the next month exceed $2.50; the largest jump was June→July 2023 (+7 %).  Extending back to 2000 adds a small number of 2007-08 cases but still yields a conditional frequency below ~2 %.

(d) Justification  
Base rate (reference class #2): <1 chance in 100 historically.  
Market data: All four publicly visible forecasts for 2026-Mar cluster at $2.05–$2.20, well under the threshold.  
Upset frequency: 2022 showed that geopolitical shocks can lift prices ≥40 % in a single month, so “black-swan” spikes are not impossible.  Crude oil today is $65/bbl, inventories are comfortable, and no major outage is underway—but Middle-East tensions or an unexpected refinery accident could occur.  I assign roughly a 6 % tail risk for such a jump in the next seven weeks.  

Blending:  
• Historical conditional base ≈ 1 %  
• Tail-event adjustment +6 %  
• Model/market consensus (implicitly <5 %) helps keep the estimate from drifting high.  

Weighted average → about an 7–8 % outside-view probability.

Outside view calibration:

1.  Anchor on conditional historical frequency ~1 %.  
2.  Recognise fat-tail behaviour (Ukraine 2022) and add 5–7 percentage points.  
3.  Keep total below 10 % because both futures strip and expert publications point decisively below $2.50.  
4.  Experts/markets are rarely off by >$0.40 in a one-month horizon; historical upset rate at that scale is well under 1 in 10.  

Final outside-view probability = 8 % (equivalent to odds of 12:1 against).

Outside View Prediction:
8%
