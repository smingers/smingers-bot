# Summary of Article: "Energy Stocks Flip the Script in Early 2026"

**Source:** OilPrice.com  
**Author:** George Doolittle  
**Date:** January 15, 2026

## Key Facts and Statistics:

### 2025 Market Performance:
- S&P 500 returned 16.4% in 2025 (third consecutive year of double-digit gains)
- Energy sector returned 7.9% in 2025, underperforming the broader market
- Oil refiners were the top-performing energy industry in 2025:
  - Valero Energy (VLO): +37.0%
  - Marathon Petroleum (MPC): +19.2%
  - Phillips 66 (PSX): +17.5%
  - Average return of "Big Three" refiners: 24.6%

### Oil Price Forecasts:
- Brent crude forecasted at $50-$60/barrel (range-bound, lower prices expected)

## Relevant Information for Jet Fuel Pricing:

### Crack Spreads and Refining Margins (2026 Outlook):
- **U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA):** Forecasts that both gasoline and diesel crack spreads will be higher on average in 2026 compared to 2025 levels
- **Rystad Energy:** Expects "very high" diesel crack spreads in Europe and the U.S. to persist through most of 2026
- Refining margins expected to remain above historical averages despite potential crude oil supply surplus
- Strong refining margins supported by high refinery utilization rates and ongoing supply constraints

### Factors Supporting Strong Refining Margins:
- Tight global refining capacity
- Lagging new refinery build-outs
- Steady demand for distillates (diesel, **jet fuel**)
- Structural imbalances in refining capacity versus product demand
- Europe faces acute diesel supply risks, suggesting continued strong margins for U.S. Gulf Coast refiners exporting to the region

### Supply Constraints:
- Planned U.S. West Coast refinery closures (Valero's Benicia refinery in April 2026 and Phillips 66's Los Angeles-area refinery)

## Analysis Context:
The article attributes strong refiner performance to tight refining capacity, steady demand for distillates (which includes jet fuel), and structural supply constraints. The EIA forecast of higher crack spreads in 2026 compared to 2025, combined with "very high" diesel crack spreads expected through most of 2026, suggests upward pressure on refined product prices including jet fuel.

# Summary of Article: Alaska Air tempers Q3 earnings expectations amid rising West Coast fuel costs

**Source:** Flight Global  
**Date:** September 15, 2025  
**Author:** Howard Hardee

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Alaska Air's Q3 2025 Fuel Price Expectations:**
   - Alaska Air now expects average jet fuel prices of **$2.50-$2.55 per gallon** during Q3 2025 (July-September period)
   - This is higher than their previous expectation of **$2.45 per gallon**

2. **Reason for Higher Fuel Costs:**
   - Rising fuel costs attributed to "ongoing refinery disruptions"
   - Alaska Air notes it faces the highest fuel costs among US airlines due to its geographic location in Seattle and focus on West Coast hubs

3. **Financial Impact:**
   - The company now expects to hit the low end of its previously forecast $1-$1.40 earnings per share for Q3 2025

4. **Other Operational Issues:**
   - Weather and air traffic control issues led to increased costs
   - An IT outage on July 20 halted flights for approximately 3 hours

5. **Revenue Performance:**
   - Third-quarter unit revenue is on track with prior guidance of flat-to-low-single-digit growth compared with Q3 2024
   - Yields turned positive year-over-year in August 2025, driven by premium-cabin strength and double-digit rebound in corporate revenue

## Named Source Opinion:

- **Andrew Levy, CEO of Avelo Airlines:** Stated that high fuel prices on the West Coast (along with competitive pressure and unfriendly business environment in California) contributed to Avelo's decision to pull out of its Burbank base

**Note:** This article focuses on Q3 2025 (July-September) fuel prices and does not provide direct information about March 2026 fuel prices.

2.  Publicly available forecasts / forward indications for March 2026

•  EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) – February-2026 edition.  
  The STEO’s “Spot petroleum product prices” table gives a quarterly forecast for the Gulf Coast jet fuel spot price. For 2026-Q1 the midpoint of the forecast band is $2.10 / gal, implying a March-2026 expectation very close to that figure (EIA STEO, 10-Feb-2026 release).  

•  TradingEconomics model-based forecast.  
  TradingEconomics shows an observed value of $2.165 / gal for February-2026 and projects the price to remain “around $2.15” during 1H-2026 (TradingEconomics, accessed 12-Feb-2026).  

•  CME Gulf Coast Jet Fuel (Platts) calendar-swap futures.  
  The March-2026 contract (ticker: QH26) last settled at $2.07 / gal on 9-Feb-2026, according to the free delayed quotes page (CME Group).  
  The thin liquidity of contracts that far forward means the futures price should be interpreted as an indicative forward curve point rather than a consensus forecast.  

•  Argus Consulting long-range balance.  
  In its December-2025 “Viewpoint: US jet fuel output seen rising with demand” Argus cites the EIA STEO price path and states that “spot Gulf Coast jet is expected to average about $2.10-$2.20 / gal in 1Q-2026 under our base case” (Argus-media, 31-Dec-2025).  

3.  What these numbers say about the $2.50 threshold

All four publicly-available forward indicators cluster roughly $0.30-$0.45 below the $2.50 trigger:

•  EIA STEO (Q1-26 midpoint) …………… ≈ $2.10  
•  TradingEconomics baseline …………… ≈ $2.15  
•  CME Mar-26 futures settle …………… ≈ $2.07  
•  Argus base-case narrative …………… $2.10-$2.20  

None of the sources currently points to an average price above $2.50 / gal for March 2026, although the 90-day historical volatility of spot Gulf Coast jet fuel (~30 %) means that a $0.35 upward move would not be unprecedented.

4.  Remaining information gaps

•  Official monthly STEO price tables stop at the quarterly level; a daily-to-monthly interpolation for March-2026 is not yet published.  
•  CME forward strip prices beyond about 12 months trade extremely thinly; real-time quotes require either a data vendor or CME login and may differ from the delayed mark used above.  
•  Proprietary forecasts (e.g., S&P Global, Wood Mackenzie, Rystad) are not publicly available. Access to those could add additional reference points but would require a subscription.

Overall, the freely available data place the current market-implied expectation for March-2026 Gulf Coast jet fuel at roughly $2.05-$2.20 / gal—comfortably below the $2.50 criterion that would trigger a “YES” resolution for the prediction question.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
