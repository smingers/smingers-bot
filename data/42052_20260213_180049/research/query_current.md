Analysis:
We need to judge whether the monthly average spot price for U.S. Gulf Coast kerosene-type jet fuel will exceed $2.50 / gal in March 2026. Useful information includes: (1) the current (February 2026) Gulf Coast jet price level and its recent trend, (2) EIA/STEO or other analyst forecasts for Q1 2026 jet or distillate prices, (3) expectations for crude oil supply/demand, refining margins, and jet cracks on the Gulf Coast, and (4) any near-term market disruptions (Middle-East tensions, refinery outages, seasonal travel demand) that could push March prices higher or lower. News or reports from EIA, IEA, major banks, refiners, and airlines published in the last few weeks will be most relevant.
