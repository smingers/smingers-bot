Analysis:
To judge whether the March-2026 Gulf Coast jet-fuel average will top $2.50/gal, I first need the long-term history of that specific EIA series—monthly or daily values—to see how often it has been above/below $2.50, recent momentum since mid-2025, and how it reacts to crude-oil movements and seasonal demand. I also want any forward-looking commentary: refinery margins, supply disruptions, or airline/energy analysts’ price forecasts for 2026. Therefore I’ll search for (1) the EIA data page or a trustworthy compiled history, (2) recent news or analyst notes discussing the 2025-26 jet-fuel outlook, and (3) a deeper multi-part query asking for both historical monthly averages and cited forecasts. Because it is an energy‐price time series, a FRED pull of the same series will add an easily downloadable historical dataset.
