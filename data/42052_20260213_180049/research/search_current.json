Outlook\n\n**Source:** Fastmarkets  \n**Date:** October 27, 2025  \n**Author:** Melissa Cousin\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n### Policy Targets and Mandates:\n- **EU RED III**: Raises renewable energy target to 42.5% of gross final energy consumption by 2030\n- **UK RTFO**: Mandates at least 14.6% of fuels used in road transport and non-road mobile machinery be renewable by 2025\n- **EU ReFuel EU Aviation Regulation**: Minimum 2% SAF at EU airports starting 2025, rising to 70% by 2050\n- **UK SAF Mandate**: 2% SAF requirement starting 2025, rising to 22% by 2040\n- **RED III cap**: Conventional biofuels from food/feed crops capped at 7% of each Member State's transport energy\n\n### Production and Supply:\n- **UK domestic biomass-based diesel production**: Surged to 950,000 tons in 2024\n- **UK biomass-based diesel supply**: Remains steady between 1.5 and 2 million tons\n- **eSAF projects in Europe**: As of mid-2025, 41 large-scale eSAF projects under development with total potential capacity of 2.8 million tons per year\n- **EU biomass-based diesel supply**: Peaks around 2024 then slightly declines due to falling demand for conventional diesel\n\n### Trade Measures:\n- **Anti-dumping duties**: EU and UK have imposed duties on biodiesel and renewable diesel imports (FAME and HVO) from China, US, Canada, Argentina, and Indonesia\n- **UK duty rates**: As high as 54.64% for non-cooperating Chinese exporters and up to 33.4% for Argentinian biodiesel\n- **SAF treatment**: EU excludes SAF from China within anti-dumping provisional duties but includes SAF from US, Canada, Argentina, and Indonesia\n\n## Key Observations:\n\n### Market Dynamics:\n- SAF consumption in Western Europe consistently exceeds production from 2020 to 2030, highlighting a growing supply gap\n- Some UK facilities are suspending operations due to market volatility\n- Investment uncertainty is a recurring theme due to evolving policy landscape and shifting regulatory definitions\n- Supply of waste and residue-based feedstocks (like used cooking oil) is inherently limited, with fierce competition across sectors\n\n### Challenges Identified:\n- Limited feedstock availability\n- Double counting issues\n- Enforcement gaps\n- High costs for advanced fuels\n- Concerns about fraud and traceability, particularly for imported feedstocks\n- Challenges in verifying origin and

2026 is expected to rise **steadily rather than exponentially**\n- Airlines are prioritizing supply security and compliance over aggressive volume targets\n- Airline commitments are described as \"irreversible\" once made publicly due to reputational risks\n\n### Policy Landscape:\n- Policy support is described as \"supportive but fragmented\"\n- **Incentives matter more than mandates in the short term** for project advancement\n- Policy uncertainty is causing developers to delay final investment decisions until clearer guidance emerges on post-2025 support structures\n- Regional divergence is widening, with some markets accelerating adoption while others remain in \"wait-and-see mode\"\n- Long-term frameworks mentioned: ICAO's CORSIA framework and national SAF blending ambitions\n\n### Feedstock Constraints:\n- **Feedstock availability is identified as \"the most significant limiting factor for SAF scale-up\"**\n- SAF is constrained by competition for low-carbon feedstocks, not just technology\n- Key challenges include:\n  - Intensifying competition with renewable diesel and biofuels\n  - Increasing scrutiny on feedstock sustainability and traceability\n  - Limited near-term scalability for advanced pathways\n- 2026 will likely see producers favor incremental capacity expansions and flexible production strategies rather than large single

The price freeze at \u20b996.7 per litre began in May 2022, when oil prices rose to $110 per barrel, and persisted for over 21 months, deviating from the government's 2017 dynamic pricing policy that mandated daily fuel price adjustments based on global crude prices. The minimal reduction in petrol prices was not due to lower oil costs but rather a \u20b92 per litre excise duty cut in mid-March 2024, which lowered the price to \u20b994.7 per litre; it later rose slightly to \u20b994.8. Experts, including Rohit Azad from Jawaharlal Nehru University, argue that oil marketing companies (OMCs) consistently pass on oil price increases to consumers but delay or omit passing on benefits from falling oil prices, calling the system 'based on convenience.' The Ministry of Petroleum and Natural Gas maintains that fuel pricing is solely the responsibility of OMCs, with no government involvement. Notably, despite a \u20b92 per litre excise duty hike in April 2025, it was not passed on to consumers, according to Minister of State Suresh Gopi.

Although prices were nearly ten cents lower just weeks prior, they are rising due to the Clean Air Act requiring refiners to switch to a more expensive and harder-to-produce 'summer blend' of gasoline, which also faces increasing demand. According to Donald Redman of AAA, the Gulf South region\u2014including Mississippi\u2014will likely remain the cheapest area for gas, with only a potential increase of up to 25 cents, possibly not exceeding January or February 2026 prices. Gas prices are down 20 cents from this time last year.

The IEA lowered its 2026 oil demand growth forecast to 850,000 barrels per day, a reduction of 80,000 bpd from its prior estimate, citing geopolitical tensions, extreme cold in North America, and delayed output from Kazakhstan. Meanwhile, OPEC+ projected a 400,000 bpd drop in crude demand for the second quarter of 2026, with average demand expected at 42.20 million bpd, down from 42.60 million bpd in the first quarter. Eight OPEC+ member nations are set to meet on March 1 to decide output levels, following a pause on production hikes for Q1 2026. Saudi Arabia\u2019s crude exports to China are expected to reach a multi-year high in March due to Aramco\u2019s price cuts. Geopolitical tensions remain elevated: U.S.-Iran talks in Muscat ended inconclusively, with President Trump threatening to deploy a second aircraft carrier to the Persian Gulf and considering seizing Iranian oil tankers. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu urged Trump to include Iran\u2019s missile program and support for Houthi and Hezbollah in negotiations. Trump referenced the 'Midnight Hammer' military operation in June 2025, when the U.S. attacked three Iranian nuclear facilities. The Pentagon is preparing a second carrier deployment. Experts believe a diplomatic resolution is likely, given both sides\u2019 reluctance to escalate militarily. In Europe, the Russia-Ukraine war persists without a ceasefire, with territorial concessions remaining the key obstacle despite multiple rounds of U.S.-Ukraine, U.S.-Russia, and tripartite talks in Abu Dhabi. Ukraine\u2019s President Zelenskyy claims Russia is blocking further negotiations. In the U.S., the nonfarm payrolls report indicated a strong job market, reducing expectations for an imminent Federal Reserve interest rate cut. Jobless claims fell by 5,000 to 227,000 for the week ending February 7.

California remains the only state with prices consistently above $4, alongside Hawaii ($4.396) and Washington ($4.068), while the national average was $2.937. Republican State Senator Suzette Martinez Valladares warned that California is nearing economic collapse due to rising fuel costs and declining refineries. The California Energy Commission (CEC) attributes high prices to the state\u2019s independent fuel system, which requires special anti-pollution additives, strict environmental regulations, and high taxes. Only 25% of California\u2019s crude oil is produced locally, with 75% imported, and the state\u2019s oil production has dropped from 398,000 barrels per day in 1985 to just 123,900 barrels in 2023\u2014a 67.8% decline. Professor Michael Mische of the University of Southern California\u2019s Marshall School of Business warned that the closure of two major refineries could create a daily gasoline shortfall of 6.6 to 13.1 million gallons, potentially increasing prices by 75% by 2026. Mische also noted that over the past 30 years, California\u2019s gasoline tax increased by 253%, vehicle registrations rose 38%, population grew 24%, but refinery count fell by 56% and in-state oil production dropped by 63%. He proposed 10 solutions to lower prices, with over eight related to relaxing state environmental and tax policies.

According to GasBuddy, California had the largest weekly price increase among all states. In Los Angeles, prices reached $4.554 per gallon, the highest in over two months. Only Hawaii ($4.396) and Washington ($4.068) had higher prices than California, while the national average was $2.937. The high prices are attributed to California\u2019s independent fuel system, which requires special anti-pollution additives, strict environmental regulations, and high taxes. California now produces only 2.5%\u20132.7% of U.S. oil, down from 398,000 barrels per day in 1985 to 123,900 in 2023\u2014a 67.8% decline. The state\u2019s refining capacity has also dropped significantly, with 56% fewer refineries and only 23.7% of demand met by domestic production. Professor Michael Mische from USC\u2019s Marshall School of Business warned in a 2025 study that the closure of two major refineries could cause a daily gasoline shortfall of 6.6 million to 13.1 million gallons, potentially driving prices up by 75% by 2026. Mische emphasized that high prices and shortages are largely self-inflicted due to a 253% increase in gasoline taxes over 30 years, despite only a 38% rise in vehicles and 24% in population. He proposed 10 solutions, over 8 of which involve relaxing state environmental and tax policies. U.S. President Trump announced plans to reduce California\u2019s gas prices by 40% by potentially limiting state fuel taxes, stating that California raises taxes when national prices drop, unlike other states. He claimed prices could fall to $2.50 per gallon.

This follows a dip to $2.78 per gallon four weeks prior\u2014the cheapest level in over four years\u2014and marks the 11th consecutive week that the national average has remained below $3 per gallon, the first sustained stretch under that threshold since May 2021. This contrasts sharply with summer 2022, when prices briefly exceeded $5 per gallon. According to AAA\u2019s state-by-state data, the cheapest gas prices are in Oklahoma, Arkansas, Kansas, and Mississippi, where averages are in the mid-$2 range. In contrast, drivers in California, Hawaii, and Washington pay over $4 per gallon, with Oregon, Nevada, and Alaska also among the most expensive states. The price gap\u2014up to $2 per gallon between Oklahoma and California\u2014is driven by differences in state gasoline taxes, with taxes accounting for more than 17% of the average price in late 2025. Additionally, California\u2019s higher prices stem from its requirement for a unique, cleaner-burning fuel blend produced by few refineries and its high state gasoline tax.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 03:56 PM\nSource:[Investopedia](https://www.investopedia.com/gas-has-stayed-near-a-4-year-low-for-weeks-here-s-where-prices-are-cheapest-11905132)\n\n**Exchange Records Rise in Gasoline and Diesel Prices in Russia**\nOn February 12, 2026, the Saint Petersburg International Commodity Exchange (SPICE) reported a continued rise in prices for petroleum products, marking the fourth consecutive session of price increases.

The promotion, available only to members of Circle K's Inner Circle rewards program, requires enrollment via the Circle K app, website, or by texting 25020. The discount applies from midnight to 11:59 p.m. on February 12. This offer comes amid persistently high gas prices across the state, with average prices in Southern California ranging from $4.36 to $4.58 per gallon and in the Bay Area from $4.85 to $4.96. In the Los Angeles-Long Beach metro area, the average price was $4.55 as of February 11, 2026. Additional pressure on fuel supply is expected due to the planned closure of Phillips 66\u2019s Wilmington refinery and Valero\u2019s idling of its Benicia refinery, which could lead to over 200 layoffs in March.

Will gas prices increase?**\nThe article discusses the implications of the U.S. seizure of Venezuelan oil assets under Operation Resolve, which removed Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and placed control of Venezuelan oil exports under U.S. oversight. Although the move has generated significant media attention, it is unlikely to cause immediate price increases for New Jersey consumers in 2026. Venezuelan oil production remains low at approximately 900,000 barrels per day\u2014less than a quarter of its 1998 peak of 3.7 million barrels per day\u2014and refineries operate at under 25% capacity. Despite this, the U.S. has seen benefits: increased exports of gasoline (800,000 barrels per day in 2024) and diesel (1.29 million barrels per day in 2024), which have helped U.S. refiners thrive. The U.S. Gulf Coast discount for heavy sour Venezuelan crude widened from $6 to $8 or more per barrel post-seizure, benefiting refineries like PBF Energy, which can process such crude and gain over 9% in cash flow per dollar of discount widening. PBF operates refineries in New Jersey (Paulsboro), Delaware, and Louisiana, including a former joint venture with Venezuela. While Venezuela\u2019s historical role as a major supplier of asphalt and roofing flux to New Jersey has ended over a decade ago, the current situation is more theatrical than economically impactful in the short term. JP Morgan forecasts that production could rise by 300,000\u2013500,000 barrels per day by late 2027, with full recovery possible by 2030. The article concludes that abundant, albeit unreliable, supply is expected through 2026 and into 2027, with gasoline, diesel, and jet fuel remaining plentiful. However, immediate energy concerns stem from a severe cold snap expected in the next 10\u201314 days, driving natural gas prices up over 80% and diesel prices up more than 30 cents per gallon in January 2026, with potential disruptions to heating oil and kerosene supplies through Ground Hog Day.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 01:00 PM\nSource:[NJ.com](https://www.nj.com/business/2026/01/what-venezuela-oil-uproar-means-for-nj-consumers-will-gas-prices-increase.html)\n\n**Fuel Prices: No Major Changes Expected for the Coming Days**\nAccording to Enap's weekly fuel price report, there are no significant changes in fuel prices for the upcoming days in Chile, except for kerosene. The price of 93-octane gasoline remains unchanged at $0 per liter, 97-octane gasoline at $0 per liter, diesel at $0 per liter, and vehicle-use LPG at $0 per liter. Enap clarifies that its report does not set or regulate fuel prices in the Chilean market; instead, final consumer prices are determined autonomously by distribution companies. Enap's pricing estimates are based on import values from the U.S. Gulf Coast market, along with costs related to maritime transportation to Chile and the application of the Fuel Price Stabilization Mechanism and the Petroleum Price Stabilization Fund.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 08:37 PM\nSource:[LA TERCERA](https://www.latercera.com/servicios/noticia/sube-o-baja-la-bencina-revisa-el-precio-del-combustible-para-los-proximos-dias-22/)\n\n**January Fuel Update: Seven-Week Price Decline Comes to a Halt**\nThe national average gasoline price in the U.S. rose to $2.76 per gallon as of January 19, 2026, ending a seven-week decline. According to Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, the increase followed a rise in oil prices, which climbed back near $60 per barrel after dipping into the mid-$50s. The national average is down 8.6 cents from a month ago and 32.3 cents lower than a year ago. All U.S. regions saw price increases this week, with the East Coast at $2.76, Midwest at $2.65, Gulf Coast at $2.40, Rocky Mountain at $2.49, and West Coast at $3.66. While most states experienced modest increases, some 'price-cycling' states saw notable jumps. De Haan noted that the situation in Venezuela has drawn attention but is unlikely to impact U.S. prices in the near term, as meaningful supply increases would take years. He expects prices to bottom out in the coming weeks before beginning a seasonal rise toward March. The 2026 projected fuel outlook estimates a national average of $2.97, with the first week of January down 2.1 cents after heavy Christmas travel. AAA data from January 19 shows Oklahoma with the lowest average at $2.34, followed by Kansas and Arkansas at $2.43, and Texas at $2.45.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 24, 2026 04:39 PM\nSource:[automotive-fleet.com](https://www.automotive-fleet.com/10252782/january-fuel-update-2026-projects-lowest-numbers-since-the-pandemic)\n\n**Important fuel price drop: check fuel costs for the coming days**\nEnap has released its weekly fuel price report, indicating a decrease in gasoline prices and an increase in kerosene for the upcoming days. Starting Thursday, January 22, 2026, 93-octane gasoline will drop by $24.3 per liter, 97-octane gasoline will also decrease by $24.3 per liter, kerosene will rise by $9.3 per liter, diesel will fall by $18.1 per liter, and vehicle-use LPG will remain unchanged. Enap clarifies that its report does not set or regulate fuel prices in Chile; final consumer prices are determined autonomously by distribution companies. The estimates are based on import values from a reference market (the U.S. Gulf Coast), maritime transport costs to Chile, and the operation of the Fuel Price Stabilization Mechanism and the Petroleum Price Stabilization Fund.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 21, 2026 08:50 PM\nSource:[LA TERCERA](https://www.latercera.com/servicios/noticia/importante-baja-de-la-bencina-revisa-el-precio-del-combustible-para-los-proximos-dias-2/)\n\n**Oil Prices Fall 2% on Expectations of Increased Supply: NYMEX Crude Drops Amid Record Surplus Forecasts**\nAccording to data from the U.S. Department of Energy, the national average retail gasoline price in the United States fell to $2.796 per gallon on January 5, 2026, the lowest level since March 2021. This represents a 1.5-cent weekly decline and a 25.1-cent drop compared to the same period in the previous year. Regional averages also declined across the board, with the West Coast at $3.708 per gallon (down 2.3 cents weekly, 8.5 cents year-over-year), and the Gulf Coast at $2.372 per gallon (down 1.8 cents weekly, 28.3 cents year-over-year). GasBuddy data, which tracks over 150,000 U.S. gas stations through more than 11 million weekly reports, shows the national average dropped to $2.74 per gallon on January 5, down 1.2 cents weekly and 29.2 cents year-over-year. Patrick De Haan, GasBuddy\u2019s petroleum analyst, stated that gasoline prices have declined for six consecutive weeks, driven by seasonal factors, and expects prices to bottom out in the coming weeks before rising in March. GasBuddy\u2019s 2026 Fuel Price Outlook projects the national average gasoline price will fall below $3.00 per gallon for the first time since the pandemic, forecasting an annual average of $2.97 per gallon\u201413 cents lower than the 2025 average of $3.10. The report notes that despite a general downward trend, volatility will persist due to seasonal demand, refinery maintenance, hurricane season, and ongoing geopolitical risks, including U.S. military actions against Venezuela. However, De Haan emphasized that Venezuela\u2019s oil output improvements will not significantly affect U.S. gas prices in the short term, as seasonal trends will still drive prices upward in spring. Structural shifts\u2014such as rising electric vehicle adoption and improved energy efficiency\u2014are moderating global oil demand growth, limiting upward price pressure even amid supply disruptions. The Connecticut Association of Energy Marketers cited increased domestic U.S. crude production as a key factor in suppressing prices, providing a buffer against global volatility. The International Energy Agency (IEA) forecasts a global crude supply surplus of at least 3.8 million barrels per day in 2026\u2014the largest on record\u2014while the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) predicts Brent crude could fall to $55 per barrel in Q1 2026 and remain low throughout the year, with a supply surplus of 2.2 million barrels per day.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 07, 2026 10:16 PM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/news/newsviewer.aspx?a=583fc425-798a-4601-a074-f77014e77739)\n\n**This Gulf country sets fuel prices for first quarter of 2026**\nKuwait has announced it will maintain fixed fuel prices for the first quarter of 2026, with premium petrol priced at 85 fils per litre, regular petrol at 105 fils, and diesel and kerosene each set at 115 fils per litre. Ultra (98-octane) petrol will be priced at 200 fils per litre, according to a senior oil source cited by Al Anba. The state committee responsible for reviewing subsidy mechanisms confirmed these prices will remain unchanged from January 1 to March 31, 2026. This policy contrasts with the broader trend across the Gulf, where most countries have liberalized fuel pricing, allowing prices to fluctuate with global oil markets and typically reviewing them monthly. The announcement was published on December 28, 2025, by GULF NEWS.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 28, 2025 04:38 PM\nSource:[GULF NEWS](https://gulfnews.com/business/energy/kuwait-sets-fuel-prices-for-first-quarter-of-2026-1.500392620)\n\n**Fuel Prices This Week: Check if Gasoline and Other Fuels Rise or Fall**\nEnap reported stability in fuel prices for the week of October 16, 2025, with only one change: a $20 per liter decrease in kerosene prices since October 16. The Empresa Nacional del Petr\u00f3leo (Enap) released its weekly price report, stating that all other fuels maintained their previous values. Enap clarified that it only provides reference prices based on import costs and technical factors, and does not regulate or set final consumer prices\u2014those are determined independently by fuel distributors. The pricing methodology considers international fuel prices from a deep and nearby market, primarily the U.S. Gulf Coast, along with maritime transport costs and other import and storage expenses. The report also notes that the Mecanismo de Estabilizaci\u00f3n de Precios de los Combustibles (MEPCO) and the Fondo de Estabilizaci\u00f3n de Precios del Petr\u00f3leo (FEPP) are used to mitigate international price fluctuations and prevent abrupt local increases. The kerosene price drop occurs during a period when household energy consumption typically declines after winter, though kerosene remains a key fuel for heating and domestic use in various regions. While overall fuel prices remain stable, the kerosene reduction offers a modest relief to consumers still reliant on this energy source.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 02:11 PM\nSource:[El Mostrador](https://www.elmostrador.cl/datos-utiles/2025/10/17/precio-de-la-bencina-esta-semana-revisa-si-sube-o-baja-el-precio-de-los-combustibles/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
