The EIA forecast of higher crack spreads in 2026 compared to 2025, combined with \"very high\" diesel crack spreads expected through most of 2026, suggests upward pressure on refined product prices including jet fuel.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.flightglobal.com/strategy/alaska-air-tempers-q3-earnings-expectations-amid-rising-west-coast-fuel-costs/164509.article\">\n# Summary of Article: Alaska Air tempers Q3 earnings expectations amid rising West Coast fuel costs\n\n**Source:** Flight Global  \n**Date:** September 15, 2025  \n**Author:** Howard Hardee\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Alaska Air's Q3 2025 Fuel Price Expectations:**\n   - Alaska Air now expects average jet fuel prices of **$2.50-$2.55 per gallon** during Q3 2025 (July-September period)\n   - This is higher than their previous expectation of **$2.45 per gallon**\n\n2. **Reason for Higher Fuel Costs:**\n   - Rising fuel costs attributed to \"ongoing refinery disruptions\"\n   - Alaska Air notes it faces the highest fuel costs among US airlines due to its geographic location in Seattle and focus on West Coast hubs\n\n3. **Financial Impact:**\n   - The company now expects to hit the low end of its previously forecast $1-$1.40 earnings per share for Q3 2025\n\n4. **Other Operational Issues:**\n   - Weather and air traffic control issues led to increased costs\n   - An IT outage on July 20 halted flights for approximately 3 hours\n\n5. **Revenue Performance:**\n   - Third-quarter unit revenue is on track with prior guidance of flat-to-low-single-digit growth compared with Q3 2024\n   - Yields turned positive year-over-year in August 2025, driven by premium-cabin strength and double-digit rebound in corporate revenue\n\n## Named Source Opinion:\n\n- **Andrew Levy, CEO of Avelo Airlines:** Stated that high fuel prices on the West Coast (along with competitive pressure and unfriendly business environment in California) contributed to Avelo's decision to pull out of its Burbank base\n\n**Note:** This article focuses on Q3 2025 (July-September) fuel prices and does not provide direct information about March 2026 fuel prices.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.deloitte.com/us/en/insights/industry/oil-and-gas/oil-and-gas-industry-outlook.html\">\n# Summary of \"2026 Oil and Gas Industry Outlook\" from Deloitte Insights\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics Relevant to Jet Fuel Pricing:\n\n**Refining Margins and Downstream Sector:**\n- US Gulf Coast refining margins fell over 50% between August 2022 and August 2025\n- US Gulf Coast crack spreads have stabilized between $12/bbl and $18/bbl (as of the article's publication)\n- D4 Renewable Identification Number (RIN) prices declined 38% between August 2022 and August 2025, but showed a 58% year-to-date rise\n- The downstream sector has faced profitability challenges\n\n**Tariff Impacts on Costs:**\n- US administration imposed 10% to 25% tariffs on non-USMCA-compliant crude feedstocks (as of October 2025)\n- Section 232 steel and aluminum duties raised to 50%\n- Tariffs on components and key input materials (steel, aluminum, copper) could increase material and service costs across the value chain by 4% to 40%\n- 2% to 5% increase in costs due to import tariffs on key materials could squeeze sector margins\n- The O&G industry relies on internationally sourced equipment worth nearly $10 billion in 2024\n\n**Industry Context:**\n- Oil and gas companies displayed \"remarkable resilience\" in 2025, though at the expense of slower production growth and tighter margins\n- Shale productivity gains are flattening, with new well oil production per rig increasing less than 2% between June 2024 to June 2025\n- The sector faces ongoing challenges including low oil prices, supply chain pressures, and a weak macro environment\n\n**LNG and Energy Policy:**\n- US LNG exports could rise by 25% in 2025 and 7% in 2026\n- Global LNG demand is projected to grow 60% by 2040\n\n**Policy Developments:**\n- Policy actions include proposed relaxation of Corporate Average Fuel Efficiency standards and sunsetting of EV incentives, which could support petroleum demand\n- Extended 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit supports renewable diesel and Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF) growth\n\n## Source Reliability:\nThis is a named, reliable source: Deloitte Insights, a major professional services firm providing industry analysis.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide monthly averages for U.S. Gulf Coast Kerosene-Type Jet Fuel spot price since 2015 and list any publicly available forecasts or forward curves indicating expected price levels for March 2026.\n1.

Publicly available forecasts / forward indications for March 2026\n\n\u2022  EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO) \u2013 February-2026 edition.  \n  The STEO\u2019s \u201cSpot petroleum product prices\u201d table gives a quarterly forecast for the Gulf Coast jet fuel spot price. For 2026-Q1 the midpoint of the forecast band is $2.10 / gal, implying a March-2026 expectation very close to that figure (EIA STEO, 10-Feb-2026 release).  \n\n\u2022  TradingEconomics model-based forecast.  \n  TradingEconomics shows an observed value of $2.165 / gal for February-2026 and projects the price to remain \u201caround $2.15\u201d during 1H-2026 (TradingEconomics, accessed 12-Feb-2026).  \n\n\u2022  CME Gulf Coast Jet Fuel (Platts) calendar-swap futures.  \n  The March-2026 contract (ticker: QH26) last settled at $2.07 / gal on 9-Feb-2026, according to the free delayed quotes page (CME Group).  \n  The thin liquidity of contracts that far forward means the futures price should be interpreted as an indicative forward curve point rather than a consensus forecast.  \n\n\u2022  Argus Consulting long-range balance.  \n  In its December-2025 \u201cViewpoint: US jet fuel output seen rising with demand\u201d Argus cites the EIA STEO price path and states that \u201cspot Gulf Coast jet is expected to average about $2.10-$2.20 / gal in 1Q-2026 under our base case\u201d (Argus-media, 31-Dec-2025).  \n\n3.  What these numbers say about the $2.50 threshold\n\nAll four publicly-available forward indicators cluster roughly $0.30-$0.45 below the $2.50 trigger:\n\n\u2022  EIA STEO (Q1-26 midpoint) \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u2248 $2.10  \n\u2022  TradingEconomics baseline \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u2248 $2.15  \n\u2022  CME Mar-26 futures settle \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 \u2248 $2.07  \n\u2022  Argus base-case narrative \u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026\u2026 $2.10-$2.20  \n\nNone of the sources currently points to an average price above $2.50 / gal for March 2026, although the 90-day historical volatility of spot Gulf Coast jet fuel (~30 %) means that a $0.35 upward move would not be unprecedented.\n\n4.  Remaining information gaps\n\n\u2022  Official monthly STEO price tables stop at the quarterly level; a daily-to-monthly interpolation for March-2026 is not yet published.  \n\u2022  CME forward strip prices beyond about 12 months trade extremely thinly; real-time quotes require either a data vendor or CME login and may differ from the delayed mark used above.  \n\u2022  Proprietary forecasts (e.g., S&P Global, Wood Mackenzie, Rystad) are not publicly available. Access to those could add additional reference points but would require a subscription.\n\nOverall, the freely available data place the current market-implied expectation for March-2026 Gulf Coast jet fuel at roughly $2.05-$2.20 / gal\u2014comfortably below the $2.50 criterion that would trigger a \u201cYES\u201d resolution for the prediction question.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"WJFUELUSGULF\" query=\"Kerosene-Type Jet Fuel, U.S. Gulf Coast\">\nFRED Economic Data: Kerosene-Type Jet Fuel Prices: U.S. Gulf Coast\nSeries ID: WJFUELUSGULF\nUnits: Dollars per Gallon\nFrequency: Weekly, Ending Friday\nLatest observation: 2.12 (2026-02-06)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=2.09, min=1.87, max=2.34\n- 5-year: mean=2.49, min=1.57, max=4.63\n- 10-year: mean=2.03, min=0.46, max=4.63\n- All-time: mean=1.55, min=0.29, max=4.63 (since 1990-04-06)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: +0.21 (+11.1%)\n- 3-month change: -0.16 (-7.2%)\n- 6-month change: +0.10 (+5.0%)\n- Year-over-year: 2.12 vs 2.31 (-8.1%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Weekly, Ending Friday):\nDate,Value\n2025-11-21,2.34\n2025-11-28,2.07\n2025-12-05,2.06\n2025-12-12,1.99\n2025-12-19,1.88\n2025-12-26,1.95\n2026-01-02,1.91\n2026-01-09,1.87\n2026-01-16,2.02\n2026-01-23,2.10\n2026-01-30,2.18\n2026-02-06,2.12\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
