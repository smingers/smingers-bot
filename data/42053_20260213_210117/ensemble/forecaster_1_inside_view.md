(b) Evidence analysis:

**Strong evidence:**
- Current trajectory: 910 cases (Feb 12) → 988 cases (Feb 13) = 78 cases in 1 day, suggesting acceleration. Multiple independent sources (CDC, NBC, CBS) confirm case counts. At current weekly rate of 150-175 cases/week sustained over 10 weeks, mathematical projection yields 2,410-2,660 cases by April 24.
- South Carolina outbreak momentum: Grew from 605 (Jan 20) → 789 (Jan 27) → 847 (Jan 31) = 242 cases in 11 days, showing no plateau. This is the largest outbreak, and its continued acceleration despite 4+ months of public health response indicates containment difficulty.
- Outbreak connectivity: Genetic sequencing confirms same Texas strain across multiple states (Utah, Arizona, South Carolina, New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio) and internationally (Mexico, Canada). This demonstrates sustained transmission chains rather than isolated incidents.
- Seasonal timing: Currently in peak measles season (late winter/spring) with spring break travel ahead (March-April), historically associated with increased transmission.

**Moderate evidence:**
- Vaccination gaps: 92.5% kindergarten coverage vs 95% needed for herd immunity, leaving ~286,000 susceptible kindergartners. This provides fuel for continued transmission, though impact depends on geographic distribution.
- Multi-state spread: 24 states reporting cases (up from 9 in early January), indicating geographic expansion. However, most cases concentrated in South Carolina.
- Expert consensus: Multiple identifiable experts (Dr. Daskalakis, Dr. Pavia, Dr. Brewer, Dr. Moss) predict continued growth and elimination status loss. While opinions, these are from credible epidemiologists.
- Historical precedent: 2025 Texas outbreak lasted 7 months (Feb-Aug), demonstrating that large outbreaks can sustain themselves. However, each outbreak has unique characteristics.

**Weak evidence:**
- Mexico outbreak context (9,351 cases, 28 deaths): While showing regional measles activity, cross-border transmission impact on U.S. case counts is unclear and likely limited given most U.S. cases are outbreak-linked domestically.
- Florida university outbreak (~60 cases): Single institution outbreak, relatively small contribution to national total.

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Prediction timeframe**: Feb 13, 2026 to April 24, 2026 = 70 days (10 weeks)

**Current status**: 988 cases as of Feb 13, 2026
**Target**: 2,000 cases (need 1,012 additional cases)
**Required rate**: ~101 cases/week or ~14.5 cases/day

**If timeframe halved (5 weeks to March 20)**:
- Need 1,012 cases in 5 weeks = 202 cases/week
- Current rate is 150-175 cases/week
- Probability would drop significantly to ~30-35%, as rate would need to accelerate substantially

**If timeframe doubled (20 weeks to July 3)**:
- Need 1,012 cases in 20 weeks = 51 cases/week
- Well below current rate
- Probability would approach ~95-98%, as even with significant containment success, this rate would likely be maintained

The 10-week timeframe is in the "sweet spot" where current rates, if sustained, would comfortably exceed the target, but significant public health intervention could potentially prevent it.

(d) Justification:

The outside view established 78% probability based on 910 cases as of Feb 12. New information shows:

1. **Acceleration beyond projection**: 988 cases by Feb 13 means 78 cases added in one day, suggesting the rate may be higher than the 150-175 cases/week estimate. This is ~546 cases/week if sustained (clearly an outlier day, but indicates volatility).

2. **Mathematical certainty at current rates**: With 988 cases and 70 days remaining, maintaining even the low end of 150 cases/week yields 988 + 1,500 = 2,488 cases. The required rate is only 101 cases/week, meaning transmission could slow by 33% and still reach 2,000.

3. **South Carolina outbreak shows no containment**: Despite 4+ months of public health response, the outbreak accelerated in late January (58 cases in 3 days). This suggests interventions have been insufficient to break transmission chains.

4. **Structural factors favor continued transmission**: 
   - 93% of cases unvaccinated/unknown status
   - 85% of cases under age 20 (school/daycare settings)
   - 90% outbreak-associated (not isolated importations)
   - Peak transmission season with spring travel ahead
   - Genetic evidence of sustained chains across multiple states

5. **Expert consensus**: Multiple credible epidemiologists predict continued growth, with some stating elimination is "already lost."

**Shift from outside view**: The new data (988 vs 910 cases, showing acceleration) and confirmation of outbreak momentum justify maintaining or slightly increasing the 78% estimate. However, I must also consider:

- **Possible mean reversion**: The 78-case single-day jump may be reporting artifact (batch reporting) rather than true acceleration
- **Intervention potential**: 70 days is sufficient time for enhanced vaccination campaigns to show effect
- **Community saturation**: South Carolina outbreak may plateau as susceptible population depletes

**Calibration**: The mathematical projection strongly supports >2,000 cases. For this NOT to occur would require:
- Transmission rate to drop below 101 cases/week (33% reduction from current)
- This would need major containment success across multiple states simultaneously
- Or South Carolina outbreak to suddenly stop (unlikely given 4-month trajectory)

The evidence supports a probability in the 75-85% range. Given the acceleration shown in latest data and the comfortable margin (need only 101 cases/week vs current 150-175), I calibrate toward the higher end.

Probability calibration:

Starting from 78% outside view, I consider:
- Positive factors: Acceleration to 988 cases, South Carolina momentum, mathematical margin of safety (+3-5%)
- Negative factors: Possible reporting artifacts, intervention potential, 70-day window for change (-1-2%)

Net adjustment: +2-3% → 80-81%

At 80%, I'm saying in 80 out of 100 similar scenarios, the U.S. would reach 2,000 cases by April 24. This feels calibrated given:
- Strong mathematical basis (requires only 67% of current rate)
- Demonstrated outbreak momentum over 4+ months
- Peak transmission season
- But acknowledging real possibility of intervention success or natural plateau

A 90% prediction would imply near-certainty, requiring essentially no chance of 33% transmission reduction. This seems overconfident given public health mobilization.

A 70% prediction would imply significant doubt about maintaining current rates, which seems too conservative given structural factors and momentum.

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will CDC report ≥2,000 cumulative U.S. measles cases for 2026 by April 24, 2026? Currently at 988 cases (Feb 13), need 1,012 more in 70 days.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 78% based on current trajectory of 150-175 cases/week sustained over 10 weeks, yielding 2,400-2,660 cases. My final prediction of 80% is rooted to this base rate with minor upward adjustment for acceleration evidence.

3. **Consistency check**: "80 out of 100 times, CDC reports ≥2,000 cumulative U.S. measles cases by April 24, 2026." This aligns with strong mathematical projection requiring only 67% of current transmission rate, while acknowledging meaningful intervention possibility.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - Current pace: 988 cases by Feb 13; need only 101/week vs current 150-175/week (strong mathematical margin)
   - South Carolina outbreak: 847 cases, accelerating through January despite 4-month response (demonstrates containment difficulty)
   - Peak season timing: Late winter/spring optimal for measles transmission, spring break travel ahead (seasonal amplification factor)
   - Multi-state genetic linkage: Same Texas strain across 10+ states indicates sustained chains, not isolated events

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Major public health mobilization (emergency vaccination campaigns, school closures, enhanced contact tracing) successfully breaks transmission chains in South Carolina and other hotspots within 2-3 weeks. South Carolina outbreak plateaus at ~900 cases, other states contain spread, weekly rate drops to 60-80 cases/week. This would yield ~1,600-1,800 total cases by April 24. Probability of this scenario: ~15-20%, which is captured in my 80% (not 90-95%) forecast.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Status quo is continued transmission at current rates (150-175 cases/week), which would yield ~2,500 cases by April 24. The world changes slowly, and measles outbreaks once established tend to persist for months (2019, 2025 Texas examples). Volatility is moderate - transmission could slow with interventions but structural factors (low vaccination, peak season, established chains) favor continuation. Status quo strongly supports Yes outcome, reinforcing 80% estimate.

Probability: 80%
