Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

**CDC Measles Cases and Outbreaks (Feb 13, 2026)**: Primary authoritative source. Reports 910 confirmed cases as of Feb 12, 2026. This is the official resolution source for the question. Highly reliable, factual data. Shows 90% of cases are outbreak-associated, with 760 cases from outbreaks starting in 2025.

**ABC News (measles cases surpass 900)**: Reputable news source reporting the same 910 cases figure, confirming CDC data. Provides state-level breakdown (24 states) and vaccination status (94% unvaccinated/unknown). Factual reporting with expert quotes from Dr. Anna Kathryn Rye Burch (pediatric infectious diseases physician).

**CNN Article (Jan 27, 2026)**: Reports South Carolina outbreak at 789 cases as of Jan 27. Notes outbreak added 600+ cases in 2026 alone. Includes expert opinion from Dr. Ralph Abraham (CDC Deputy Director) suggesting loss of elimination status is "not really significant" - this is opinion, not fact. The case counts are factual.

**NPR Article (Jan 31, 2026)**: Reports 847 South Carolina cases by Jan 31, showing rapid growth (58 new cases in 3 days). Includes expert opinions from multiple epidemiologists. Dr. Demetre Daskalakis states "elimination is already lost" - expert opinion. Dr. William Moss warns of continued growth - predictive opinion. Case counts are factual.

**CDC Global Measles Outbreaks (Feb 11, 2026)**: Provides global context showing measles activity rising worldwide. Factual data on international outbreaks. Less directly relevant to US case projections.

**Agent Report**: Comprehensive compilation of historical data (2010-2025) showing annual case counts. Key facts: 2019 had 1,274 cases (previous high since 2000); 2025 had 2,280 cases (highest in 33 years); 2024 had only 285 cases. The report calculates current pace at ~150-175 cases/week. This analysis appears sound based on available data.

(b) Reference class analysis:

**Reference Class 1: 2025 trajectory (same year pattern)**
- 2025 reached ~900 cases in late May (approximately 5 months into the year)
- 2026 reached 910 cases by Feb 12 (1.5 months into the year)
- Suitability: Moderate. Different outbreak dynamics; 2026 is accelerating faster due to carryover from 2025 outbreaks

**Reference Class 2: Large outbreak years (2019, 2014)**
- 2019: 1,274 cases total (largest since 2000)
- 2014: 667 cases total
- Suitability: Limited. These were contained within single years without multi-year outbreak chains

**Reference Class 3: Multi-year outbreak progression (2025-2026 continuation)**
- Most suitable reference class
- 2025 outbreaks (Texas, South Carolina) began mid-year and continued into 2026
- 760 of 2026's 910 cases (as of Feb 12) are from 2025-origin outbreaks
- South Carolina outbreak grew from ~200 cases (Dec 2025) to 847 cases (Jan 31, 2026)
- This represents ongoing transmission chains rather than new independent outbreaks

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Prediction timeframe**: Feb 13, 2026 to April 24, 2026 = 70 days (10 weeks)

**Current status**: 910 cases as of Feb 12, 2026
**Target**: 2,000 cases (need 1,090 additional cases)
**Required rate**: ~156 cases/week or ~22 cases/day

**Historical patterns over similar periods**:

From Jan 1 - Feb 12, 2026 (43 days):
- 910 cases accumulated
- Average: ~21 cases/day or ~147 cases/week
- This closely matches the required rate

From late Jan to late Jan (South Carolina outbreak acceleration):
- Jan 27: 789 SC cases
- Jan 31: 847 SC cases (58 cases in 4 days = 14.5 cases/day from SC alone)

Weekly patterns from Agent Report:
- Current weekly average: 150-175 cases/week nationally
- This rate, if sustained, would yield: 910 + (10 weeks × 162.5 avg) = 2,535 cases by April 24

**Seasonal factors**: 
- Measles transmission typically peaks in late winter/early spring
- Spring break travel (March-April) could accelerate spread
- We are currently in the optimal transmission season

(d) Justification:

The outside view strongly suggests reaching 2,000 cases is probable:

1. **Current trajectory**: At 910 cases by Feb 12, the pace is ~21 cases/day. Maintaining this rate for 70 more days would yield 910 + (70 × 21) = 2,380 cases.

2. **Outbreak momentum**: 90% of cases are outbreak-associated, with the South Carolina outbreak still actively growing (789→847 cases in 4 days in late January). The outbreak shows no signs of plateauing.

3. **Multi-state spread**: Cases linked to South Carolina have appeared in North Carolina, Washington, and other states, indicating geographic expansion rather than containment.

4. **Vaccination gaps**: With 92.5% kindergarten vaccination (below 95% herd immunity threshold) and 286,000 susceptible kindergartners, there's substantial fuel for continued transmission.

5. **Historical precedent**: 2025 demonstrated that large outbreaks can sustain themselves for months (Texas outbreak: Feb-Aug 2025, 760+ cases).

6. **Seasonal timing**: We're in peak measles season (late winter/spring), with spring break travel ahead.

**Counterarguments**:
- Public health interventions (quarantines, catch-up vaccination) could slow transmission
- Possible saturation in heavily affected communities
- CDC and state health departments are actively responding with resources

However, the South Carolina outbreak's continued acceleration through January 2026 despite interventions suggests containment efforts have been insufficient. The fact that 760 of current cases stem from 2025 outbreaks indicates these chains have proven difficult to break.

Outside view calibration:

The mathematical projection is straightforward: current rate of ~150-165 cases/week sustained for 10 weeks would easily exceed 2,000 cases (yielding 2,400-2,560 cases).

Key calibration factors:

1. **Tethering to rough figures**: The Agent Report's calculation of 150-175 cases/week is well-supported. At the low end (150/week), we get 910 + 1,500 = 2,410 cases. At the high end (175/week), we get 910 + 1,750 = 2,660 cases.

2. **Rate of unexpected outcomes**: Measles outbreaks can be unpredictable, but once established in under-vaccinated communities, they tend to persist. The 2019 outbreak sustained itself for months. The Texas 2025 outbreak lasted 7 months. Current South Carolina outbreak has been growing for 4+ months with no plateau visible.

3. **Probability anchoring**: 
   - If transmission continues at current rate: ~95% probability of reaching 2,000
   - If transmission slows by 25% due to interventions: still ~75% probability
   - If transmission slows by 50% (major containment success): ~40% probability
   - If transmission accelerates (spring travel, new outbreaks): ~99% probability

4. **Expert opinions**: Dr. Daskalakis stated elimination is "already lost," suggesting continued high transmission. Dr. Moss predicted continued growth. Dr. Burch expected numbers to "continue to grow over the next several months."

5. **Base rate consideration**: Since 2000, the US has exceeded 1,000 cases only twice (2014: 667; 2019: 1,274). However, 2025's 2,280 cases and 2026's unprecedented early pace represent a regime change, not normal variation.

The most likely scenario is that transmission continues at roughly the current rate (perhaps with slight deceleration as some communities reach higher immunity). A 25% slowdown would still yield ~2,100 cases. Major containment success seems unlikely given the 4-month failure to contain South Carolina and the multi-state spread.

Calibrating for uncertainty and possible containment efforts, but recognizing the strong momentum and seasonal factors, I assess the probability at approximately 78%.
