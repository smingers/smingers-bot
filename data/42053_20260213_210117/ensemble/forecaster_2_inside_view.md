Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary CDC Sources:**
1. **CDC "Measles Cases and Outbreaks" page (Feb 11, 2026)**: Authoritative primary source. Pure factual data on global outbreaks, no U.S. 2026 counts. High quality.

2. **CDC data via multiple news outlets (Feb 12-13, 2026)**: Multiple sources (NBC News, WHAM1180, iHeart) independently report 988 cases as of Feb 13, 2026. This is factual CDC data, not opinion. High quality, current.

**Secondary News Sources:**
3. **ASTHO article (Jan 21, 2026)**: Reports 2,144 cases in 2025 (factual CDC data). Mentions upcoming PAHO meeting April 13, 2026 to review elimination status. Expert opinions from public health officials. High quality.

4. **CBS News (Feb 13, 2026)**: Reports "over 1,000 confirmed cases in 2026" and Florida university outbreak (~60 cases). Includes expert quotes from Dr. Ralph Abraham (CDC) and Dr. Marty Makary (FDA). Factual case counts with identified expert opinions. High quality.

5. **Multiple Korean/Chinese news sources (Feb 13, 2026)**: Report 896 cases as of Feb 12, 2026. Note discrepancy with other sources reporting 988 on Feb 13. These cite CDC but may have timing differences. Moderate quality due to translation and slight inconsistency.

6. **Mexico outbreak data (Feb 13, 2026)**: MARCA reports 9,351 cumulative cases in Mexico (2025-2026 combined). Relevant for cross-border transmission risk. Factual government data. Moderate quality for U.S. prediction.

7. **South Carolina outbreak specifics**: Multiple sources confirm 605-847 cases in South Carolina alone, with rapid growth (58 cases in 3 days reported). This is the epicenter. Strong evidence.

**Key Factual Consensus:**
- 988 cases confirmed in U.S. as of Feb 13, 2026 (most reliable figure)
- South Carolina has 605-847 cases (largest outbreak)
- 93-95% of cases are unvaccinated
- 2025 had 2,144-2,280 cases (sources vary slightly)
- Vaccination rate dropped to 92.5% (below 95% herd immunity threshold)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Current case count trajectory**: 988 cases by Feb 13 is unprecedented. In 2025 (highest recent year), only ~500 cases by April 24. Multiple independent sources confirm this. This represents a ~2x acceleration.

2. **South Carolina outbreak size and growth rate**: 605-847 cases with documented 58-case increase in 3 days. Multiple sources (NBC, CBS, state health dept) confirm ongoing community transmission. This single outbreak could theoretically reach 1,500+ cases alone if unchecked.

3. **Vaccination coverage below herd immunity**: 92.5% coverage vs. 95% needed. This is structural and won't change in 71 days. Creates sustained transmission conditions.

4. **Geographic spread**: 24 states affected (per multiple sources), indicating multiple simultaneous outbreak chains, not just one containable cluster.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Mexico cross-border transmission**: 9,351 cases in Mexico with ongoing transmission. Geographic proximity to Texas/Arizona outbreaks. Logical causal link but indirect.

2. **Historical growth patterns**: 2019 had 695 cases by April 26 (55% of annual total). 2025 had ~500 by April 24 (22% of annual total). Current year already exceeds both, suggesting different dynamics.

3. **Policy environment**: RFK Jr. as HHS Secretary mentioned in multiple sources as contributing to vaccine hesitancy. However, policy changes take time to affect vaccination rates.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **University outbreaks**: Florida university has ~60 cases. Suggests potential for institutional clusters but limited scale impact.

2. **Seasonal factors**: Measles typically peaks in spring. We're entering peak season, which could accelerate transmission.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeframe**: 71 days (Feb 13 to April 24, 2026) = ~10 weeks

**Current trajectory**: 988 cases by Feb 13 means we need +1,012 cases to reach 2,000.
- Required average: ~144 cases/week
- Recent observed rate: ~150-175 cases/week (based on "279 new cases in first full week of 2026" from NBC)

**If timeframe halved (35 days to ~March 19)**: Would need ~290 cases/week to reach 2,000. This is nearly double the current rate. Probability would drop to ~15-20%.

**If timeframe doubled (142 days to ~July 6)**: Would need ~72 cases/week. Even with significant containment efforts, this seems highly likely given current momentum. Probability would increase to ~75-85%.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view base rate**: 36% (adjusted from 3.6% base for unprecedented early count)

**Factors warranting upward adjustment:**

1. **Trajectory is steeper than assumed in outside view**: The outside view calculated ~109 cases/week needed. Current observed rate is 150-175/week, which is 37-60% higher than required. This alone suggests the target is more likely than the outside view estimated.

2. **South Carolina outbreak shows no signs of plateauing**: With 58 cases added in 3 days (mid-February), the largest outbreak is still in exponential phase. Historical U.S. outbreaks typically plateau after 4-6 months when susceptible pool depletes. This outbreak began in October 2025, so plateau might not occur until March-April.

3. **Multiple simultaneous outbreak chains**: 24 states affected means containment would need to succeed in multiple locations simultaneously. This is structurally harder than containing a single outbreak.

4. **Below herd immunity threshold**: At 92.5% vaccination, sustained transmission is mathematically expected. This wasn't true in most historical reference years.

**Factors warranting downward adjustment:**

1. **Public health response intensification**: Once cases become visible crisis, resources mobilize. However, this typically takes 2-4 weeks to show effect in case counts.

2. **Susceptible pool depletion**: With 988 cases already, some high-risk communities may be approaching local saturation. However, 24-state spread suggests many untapped pockets remain.

3. **Surveillance artifact risk**: Some "confirmed" cases might be downgraded upon further review. However, CDC confirmation process is typically rigorous.

**Net assessment**: Current evidence suggests the 36% outside view was too conservative. The observed weekly rate (150-175) significantly exceeds the required rate (144), and structural factors (low vaccination, multiple chains, peak season ahead) support continuation. The main uncertainty is whether public health interventions can rapidly bend the curve downward.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from 36% outside view:

**Upward adjustments:**
- Current weekly rate exceeds required rate by 40%: +15 percentage points
- South Carolina outbreak still accelerating: +8 percentage points  
- Multiple simultaneous chains harder to contain: +5 percentage points
- Entering peak transmission season: +3 percentage points

**Downward adjustments:**
- Possible public health response effect by April: -5 percentage points
- Some susceptible pool depletion in affected areas: -3 percentage points

**Net adjustment**: +23 percentage points

**Calibrated prediction**: 36% + 23% = 59%

However, checking this against the "59 out of 100 times" test: This feels slightly high given that it requires sustaining current rates for 10 weeks without significant intervention success. Tempering to account for uncertainty in outbreak dynamics and potential rapid containment in some chains.

**Final calibrated prediction**: 54%

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will U.S. measles cases reach ≥2,000 by April 24, 2026 (71 days from now) per CDC data?
   - ✓ Analysis aligns with resolution criteria and timeframe

2. **Base rate**: 36% from outside view
   - ✓ Final prediction (54%) is rooted in this base with explicit justification for +18pp shift

3. **Consistency**: "54 out of 100 times, U.S. measles cases reach 2,000 by April 24, 2026."
   - ✓ This seems reasonable given current trajectory of 150-175 cases/week vs. 144 needed, with 10 weeks remaining

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - 988 cases by Feb 13 vs. historical ~200-300 at this point (STRONG, factual, CDC-confirmed)
   - Weekly rate 150-175 cases exceeds 144 needed (STRONG, derived from multiple sources)
   - South Carolina +58 cases in 3 days shows acceleration (STRONG, state health dept data)
   - 24 states affected = multiple outbreak chains (STRONG, CDC data)
   - 92.5% vaccination below 95% herd immunity (STRONG, CDC surveillance data)
   - ✓ All pieces are factually grounded in CDC or state health department data

5. **Blind spot**: Rapid, coordinated public health intervention across multiple states successfully contains outbreaks by early March, causing weekly rate to drop to <100. This could occur if federal emergency declaration triggers massive vaccination campaigns. Would lower probability to ~30-35%.

6. **Status quo**: Current trend is 150-175 cases/week. If this simply continues unchanged, we reach 2,000 by late March (6 weeks). The world changes slowly, but disease outbreaks can have rapid inflection points (either acceleration or containment). Given 71-day timeframe is relatively short and current momentum is strong, status quo favors "Yes" outcome. No adjustment needed.
