Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**CDC Measles Cases and Outbreaks (February 13, 2026):**
Primary authoritative source. Reports 910 confirmed cases as of February 12, 2026. High quality, official government data. Notes that 90% of cases are outbreak-associated, with 760 cases from outbreaks starting in 2025 (particularly South Carolina). Data is preliminary and subject to change.

**ABC News (date unclear, reporting on 900+ cases):**
Secondary news source citing CDC data. Reports 910 cases across 24 states, with 94% unvaccinated or unknown status. Mentions South Carolina outbreak with 933 cases as of their reporting date. Moderate quality, relies on CDC data.

**CNN (January 27, 2026):**
Secondary news source. Reports South Carolina outbreak at 789 cases as of January 27, 2026, with 600+ cases added in 2026 alone. Notes national total of 416 cases as of "Thursday before South Carolina's latest numbers" (likely late January). Expert opinion from Dr. Abraham (CDC) is notable but represents administrative perspective rather than epidemiological forecast.

**NPR (January 31, 2026):**
Secondary news source. Reports South Carolina outbreak at 847 cases as of January 31, 2026. Provides expert opinions from multiple epidemiologists. Dr. Daskalakis (former CDC official) states elimination is "already lost." Dr. Moss warns of continued growth. High-quality journalism with named expert sources.

**CDC Global Measles Outbreaks (February 11, 2026):**
Provides global context. Notes measles activity rising globally and in the U.S. after pandemic decrease. References 2019 near-loss of elimination status with ~1,300 cases. Relevant for understanding international travel risk factors.

**Agent Report:**
Comprehensive compilation of historical data (2010-2025) and outbreak narratives. Key facts: 2019 had 1,274 cases; 2024 had 285 cases; 2025 had 2,280 cases (highest since 1992); 2026 has 910 cases through February 12. Notes current weekly average of 150-175 cases/week. High quality synthesis with proper source attribution.

**Key Factual Information vs. Opinions:**
- **Facts:** 910 cases as of Feb 12, 2026; 2,280 cases in 2025; South Carolina outbreak is largest contributor; 90% of cases outbreak-associated; 760 cases from 2025-origin outbreaks continuing into 2026
- **Expert Opinions:** Dr. Daskalakis believes elimination already lost; Dr. Abraham downplays significance of elimination status; various experts predict continued growth

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **2025 trajectory (same outbreak continuation):** Most relevant because 2026 cases are predominantly (760/910 = 83%) from outbreaks that started in 2025, particularly South Carolina. However, 2025 reached only ~900 cases by late May, whereas 2026 already has 910 by mid-February.

2. **2019 outbreak year (1,274 total cases):** Relevant as the last major outbreak year before 2025. However, 2019 had different dynamics (New York Orthodox Jewish communities) and didn't have the same multi-state, multi-outbreak pattern.

3. **Post-elimination years (2000-2023 average ~180 cases/year):** Not suitable - 2025-2026 represents a fundamental break from this pattern.

4. **Weekly case rate extrapolation:** Agent report suggests 150-175 cases/week currently. This is the most direct reference class for near-term forecasting.

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** Weekly case rate extrapolation combined with understanding of 2025 outbreak continuation dynamics.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** February 13, 2026 to April 24, 2026 = 70 days (10 weeks)

**Current Status:** 910 cases as of February 12, 2026
**Target:** 2,000 cases
**Gap:** 1,090 additional cases needed
**Required weekly average:** 1,090 ÷ 10 weeks = 109 cases/week

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**

From Agent Report and sources:
- Current weekly average: 150-175 cases/week (since early January 2026)
- South Carolina outbreak added 600+ cases in January 2026 alone (CNN)
- South Carolina grew from 789 (Jan 27) to 847 (Jan 31) = 58 cases in 4 days = ~100 cases/week from SC alone
- 2025 reached ~900 cases only in late May, but 2026 reached 910 by mid-February (2.5 months ahead)

**Trajectory Comparison:**
- If 150 cases/week continues: 910 + (150 × 10) = 2,410 cases by April 24
- If 175 cases/week continues: 910 + (175 × 10) = 2,660 cases by April 24
- If rate drops to 109 cases/week (minimum needed): exactly 2,000 cases

## (d) Justification

**Factors Supporting High Probability (>2,000 cases):**

1. **Current momentum:** 910 cases in 43 days = 21.2 cases/day average. Extrapolating: 910 + (21.2 × 70) = 2,394 cases by April 24.

2. **Outbreak continuation:** 760 of current 910 cases stem from 2025-origin outbreaks still active. South Carolina outbreak shows no signs of plateauing (grew 58 cases in 4 days late January).

3. **Seasonal factors:** Winter/spring transmission typically peaks; spring break travel (March-April) could amplify spread.

4. **Multiple active foci:** 24 jurisdictions reporting cases; 5 new 2026 outbreaks beyond the 2025 carryovers.

5. **Vaccination gaps:** 92.5% kindergarten coverage (below 95% herd immunity threshold); 94% of 2026 cases unvaccinated/unknown status.

6. **Unprecedented trajectory:** 2026 is 2.5 months ahead of 2025's record pace.

**Factors Against (Might Not Reach 2,000):**

1. **Containment efforts:** Federal aid ($1.4M to South Carolina); heightened public health response; school quarantines.

2. **Susceptible pool depletion:** After 2,280 cases in 2025, some under-vaccinated communities may have fewer susceptibles remaining.

3. **Outbreak maturation:** South Carolina outbreak began October 2025; might naturally plateau after 4-5 months.

4. **Required deceleration:** Current 150-175 cases/week must drop to only 109 cases/week average - a 30-40% reduction.

**Critical Uncertainty:** Will South Carolina outbreak plateau or continue exponential growth? If it plateaus soon, reaching 2,000 becomes uncertain. If it continues current trajectory, 2,000 is virtually certain.

## Outside View Calibration

**Anchoring to Data:**
- Current rate: 21.2 cases/day
- Days remaining: 70
- Simple extrapolation: 910 + 1,484 = 2,394 cases (394 above threshold)

**Conservative Adjustment:**
Assume some deceleration due to containment efforts. If rate drops 25% to ~16 cases/day:
910 + (16 × 70) = 2,030 cases (still above threshold)

**Aggressive Deceleration Scenario:**
If rate drops 40% to ~13 cases/day:
910 + (13 × 70) = 1,820 cases (below threshold)

**Historical Upset Rate:**
In measles outbreak forecasting, public health interventions can significantly alter trajectories. However, the 2025 experience shows that despite awareness and resources, cases still reached 2,280. The current multi-state, multi-outbreak nature makes complete containment unlikely within 10 weeks.

**Probability Assessment:**
- Very likely scenario (70%): Rate stays 15-21 cases/day → 1,960-2,384 cases
- Moderate scenario (20%): Rate drops to 13-15 cases/day → 1,820-1,960 cases  
- Low scenario (10%): Dramatic containment, rate drops below 13 cases/day → <1,820 cases

The question asks for ≥2,000 cases. Given current momentum, multiple active outbreaks, seasonal factors, and the difficulty of rapid containment, the probability of reaching 2,000 is high but not certain. The main risk is faster-than-expected containment of South Carolina outbreak combined with no major new outbreak emergence.
