Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / resolution alignment  
Question resolves **Yes** if the CDC “Measles Cases and Outbreaks” page shows **≥2,000 cumulative confirmed U.S. measles cases for 2026** as of the CDC update reflecting reports **through April 24, 2026**.

(a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality/date; facts vs opinions)
- **CDC – Global Measles Outbreaks (Feb 11, 2026)**: High-quality official context that global measles is elevated and widespread; provides a mechanism (importations into undervaccinated pockets). Not direct U.S. counts. Mostly factual.
- **ASTHO blog (Jan 21, 2026)**: Credible public health organization summarizing CDC-style stats and elimination-status context. Reports **~2,144 U.S. cases in 2025** and outbreak/coverage details. Mostly factual; some interpretive framing.
- **NBC News data/graphics (Feb 13, 2026)**: Reputable outlet aggregating CDC/state data; reports **>900 U.S. cases so far in 2026** and rapid early-week growth. Factual counts likely accurate but secondary; interpretation is journalistic.
- **iHeart/WHAM repost (Feb 13, 2026)**: Secondary media citing CDC/state officials; reports **988 confirmed 2026 cases** and detailed South Carolina outbreak contribution. Useful but not primary; treat counts as plausible but defer to CDC for final resolution.
- **CBS News (Feb 13, 2026)**: Secondary reporting; mentions **over 1,000** tracked (likely from a tracker) and a Florida university cluster. Good for corroborating broad direction, less for exact CDC-number precision.
- **The Hill / National Post (Jan 23, 2026)**: Secondary reporting; emphasizes that most cases are outbreak-linked and that PAHO review is upcoming. Helpful for “continued transmission” narrative; not primary for counts.
- **Independent / ArcaMax / New Republic / foreign-language wire pieces (Feb 10–13, 2026)**: Mostly repackaged reporting plus opinionated political attributions. Use mainly for cross-confirmation that counts are high and geographically broad; discount politicized causal claims.
- **Mexico outbreak articles (Feb 10–13, 2026)**: Relevant only indirectly (importation/region-wide transmission pressure). Generally factual but not decisive for the U.S. threshold by Apr 24.

Bottom line on sources: For the forecast, the key “hard” evidence is the **current CDC-reported (or CDC-attributed) 2026 cumulative case count around ~900–1,000 by Feb 12–13**, plus outbreak concentration in South Carolina and spread across ~20+ states. Everything else is context or mechanism.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence (large weight):
- **Level already near ~900–1,000 by Feb 12–13 (CDC-attributed across multiple outlets)**: Starting point is extremely high for mid-February. This alone makes ≥2,000 by Apr 24 plausible with modest continuation.
- **Ongoing large outbreak(s), especially South Carolina contributing the majority** (multiple sources): A large, still-growing epicenter is a strong driver of near-term additions.
- **Structural vulnerability: kindergarten MMR coverage ~92.5% vs ~95% herd threshold** (repeated across sources): Hard-to-change short-run; supports continued outbreak risk.

Moderate evidence (moderate weight):
- **Momentum / implied incidence rates** (e.g., hundreds in a week early Jan; dozens in days in SC): Trend evidence supports a continued elevated run rate, though it can regress with interventions.
- **Geographic breadth (≈23–24 states)**: Reduces the chance that “one outbreak ends” stops national growth; increases probability of additional sparks.
- **Seasonality & travel (late winter/spring, spring break)**: Logical amplifier, but uncertain magnitude.

Weak evidence (small weight):
- **Claims about specific political figures causing the outbreak**: Could matter indirectly via vaccination sentiment, but highly confounded and not needed to predict the April threshold.
- **Mexico/Canada elimination-status news**: Useful context, but U.S. crossing 2,000 by Apr 24 depends more on U.S. outbreak trajectories than formal status.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time remaining: **~70 days (~10 weeks)** from Feb 13 to Apr 24, 2026.
- Mechanical requirement: If current 2026 cumulative is ~**988**, then reaching 2,000 needs **+1,012 cases** in ~10 weeks ⇒ **~101/week** (or ~14–15/day).
- If timeframe were halved (~5 weeks): threshold becomes much harder; the forecast would drop substantially because it would require ~200/week from mid-Feb to late March.  
- If timeframe were doubled (~20 weeks): threshold becomes much easier; forecast would rise meaningfully because even strong deceleration could still accumulate ≥2,000 by early summer.

(d) Justification: updating the outside view (73%) to an inside view
Outside-view base rate (given): **73%**.

Key inside-view update: the “starting line” is already extremely high by mid-February (near 1,000). To *miss* 2,000 by Apr 24, the U.S. would need a fairly sharp and sustained deceleration to <~100/week nationally over the next 10 weeks. That is possible (aggressive containment + outbreak burnout in SC + few new outbreaks), but current reporting suggests:
- the main outbreak has been adding cases quickly and remains active,
- spread is multi-state (not a single contained cluster),
- structural vaccination gaps are not quickly fixable in 10 weeks.

So I move upward from 73%. I do not go to ~95% because measles outbreaks can bend down quickly with targeted vaccination/quarantine, and one dominant epicenter might plateau sooner than linear extrapolation assumes.

Probability calibration:
- Status quo / trend-continues scenario: If the next 10 weeks average even ~140/week, we clear 2,000 comfortably. (This is only modestly above the minimum ~101/week.)
- “Containment succeeds” scenario (main path to NO): SC outbreak sharply plateaus in late Feb/early Mar; secondary outbreaks stay small; national run-rate drops below ~90–100/week for most of the window.
- “Acceleration” scenario: spring travel + new undervaccinated clusters produce additional large outbreaks; then ≥2,000 becomes very likely and could be exceeded well before Apr 24.

Net: I update **up** to reflect (i) the high current cumulative and (ii) the relatively low required weekly incidence to reach 2,000, while retaining meaningful mass on rapid-decay outcomes.

Checklist:
1. Criteria check: CDC cumulative confirmed U.S. measles cases for **2026** as of **Apr 24, 2026** ≥ **2,000** ⇒ Yes.  
2. Outside view base rate: **73%**.  
3. Consistency line: **81 out of 100 times**, CDC cumulative 2026 cases by Apr 24 are **≥2,000**.  
4. Most significant evidence (≤20 words each):
   - ~900–1,000 cases already by Feb 12–13, leaving only ~1,000 needed in ~10 weeks.
   - Large ongoing SC outbreak contributing most cases; reports show continued rapid additions.
   - National MMR coverage ~92.5% (below herd threshold) + multi-state spread increases persistence/new sparks.
   - Required pace to reach threshold (~101/week) is not high given recent observed momentum.
5. Blind spot (most likely to make me look silly): A fast SC plateau plus aggressive vaccination/quarantine drives national incidence <90/week for 10 straight weeks.  
6. Status quo outcome: With current elevated outbreak conditions, the “do nothing new” trajectory points to **Yes**, so avoid over-weighting sudden containment.

Probability: 81%
