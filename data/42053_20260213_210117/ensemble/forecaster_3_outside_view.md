Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (summary, quality, and what’s fact vs opinion)

1) **CDC “Measles Cases and Outbreaks” page (Feb 13, 2026 update; data as of Feb 12, 2026)**  
- **Key facts used:** 2026 YTD confirmed cases = **910**; **90%** outbreak-associated; **760** of the 2026 cases are from outbreaks that **started in 2025**; 2025 full-year total **2,280**; kindergarten MMR coverage down to **92.5%** (2024–25).  
- **Quality:** Highest. Primary source for the resolution metric; updated weekly on a defined cadence.  
- **Opinions vs facts:** Mostly factual surveillance reporting; any interpretive statements about “risk” are secondary, but the numeric counts and breakdowns are the main anchor.

2) **ABC News summary (date not explicitly shown here; references CDC)**  
- **Key facts used:** Repeats CDC’s ~910 count and vaccination-status breakdown; notes locations/outbreak mentions.  
- **Quality:** Medium-high as a secondary reporter; likely accurate on the top-line numbers because it’s paraphrasing CDC.  
- **Opinions vs facts:** Some framing about implications; treat those as commentary, but the case count and vaccine-status proportions are factual as cited to CDC.

3) **CDC FastStats measles page (older data context, mainly 2019-era stats)**  
- **Key facts used:** Historical baseline (e.g., 2019 ~1,275).  
- **Quality:** High for what it covers, but **not directly informative** about 2026 dynamics or the April 24 threshold.  
- **Opinions vs facts:** Purely descriptive statistics.

4) **CNN article (Jan 27, 2026) on South Carolina outbreak**  
- **Key facts used:** Size/scale claims about the South Carolina outbreak; mentions linkages to other states; federal response.  
- **Quality:** Medium-high; reputable outlet, but outbreak totals can vary by date/definition and should be reconciled to CDC where possible. Still useful for situational awareness.  
- **Opinions vs facts:** Contains quoted opinions from identified individuals (e.g., CDC official, clinicians). Those opinions are not used as numeric anchors, but they help characterize plausibility of continued transmission.

5) **CDC “Global Measles Outbreaks” page (Feb 11, 2026)**  
- **Key facts used:** Global outbreaks widespread; measles importation risk; global incidence context.  
- **Quality:** High; but mostly **contextual** rather than directly predictive of the U.S. April 24 count.  
- **Opinions vs facts:** Primarily factual summaries.

6) **NPR article (Jan 31, 2026) on elimination status**  
- **Key facts used:** Narrative about continued transmission; expert quotes; mentions outbreak growth/trajectory.  
- **Quality:** Medium-high; good journalism with named experts, but not the resolution source.  
- **Opinions vs facts:** Uses identifiable expert opinions (e.g., former CDC official); those opinions inform risk directionally, not as hard quantitative inputs.

7) **Agent_report (compiled historical annual totals; notes on outbreak drivers; claims about 2025 timing)**  
- **Key facts used:** Long-run annual case totals; qualitative comparison.  
- **Quality:** Mixed. Helpful synthesis, but parts rely on **secondary compilations (e.g., Statista)** and some timing claims (e.g., “2025 reached ~900 cases only in late May”) that should be treated cautiously unless verified.  
- **Opinions vs facts:** Mostly descriptive; any “on pace” conclusions are analytic judgments, not official.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view candidates)

Because the threshold is **as-of April 24** (not full-year), good reference classes are those that connect **early-year cumulative** to later spring cumulative.

**Reference class 1: U.S. measles annual totals in the post-elimination era (2000–2024), ignoring 2025–2026 exceptional years.**  
- Suitability: Limited. Base rate of “≥2,000 by late April” would be ~0% historically, but this ignores that we’re already in an exceptional regime (2025: 2,280 full-year; 2026 already 910 by Feb 12).

**Reference class 2: High-incidence modern U.S. measles years (e.g., 2014, 2019, 2025).**  
- Suitability: Better. Still small N, but it captures the “big outbreak year” tail behavior. In these years, totals can exceed 1,000, and spring is often the peak transmission period.

**Reference class 3 (most suitable): “Years/episodes where the U.S. has already accumulated ~900 confirmed cases by mid-February.”**  
- Suitability: Conceptually best because it conditions on a powerful leading indicator (early cumulative).  
- Limitation: Essentially **N≈1** in modern U.S. history, so we must broaden with analogous outbreaks (large outbreaks that continue into spring) and general epidemic behavior: outbreaks often slow after interventions, but measles also has strong seasonality into spring and can propagate in under-immunized pockets.

Given the question and available data, I’ll use **Reference class 2** as the “true outside view,” while using the **910-by-mid-Feb fact** as a conditioning datapoint (still outside-view-ish because it’s a simple leading indicator rather than detailed mechanistic modeling).

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Forecast window:** From **today (Feb 13, 2026)** to **Apr 24, 2026** is ~**10 weeks** (~70 days).  
- **Arithmetic requirement:** Starting at **910** (as of Feb 12), reaching **2,000** requires **+1,090 cases** over ~10 weeks, i.e. roughly **109 cases/week** on average.  
- **Historical pattern over similar periods:** Measles transmission in temperate climates commonly **peaks in late winter/spring**. So Feb→Apr is not a “naturally declining” season; it’s plausibly a high-transmission period unless intensive control measures sharply reduce spread.

---

### (d) Justification (integrating outside-view factors)

1) **The base-rate world (pre-2025) would say “almost certainly not.”**  
For roughly 2010–2024, annual totals were typically in the dozens to hundreds, with only rare years above ~600 and only 2019 above ~1,000. On that long-run view, “≥2,000 by late April” is an extreme tail event.

2) **But the relevant regime has changed: 2025 demonstrated 2,000+ annual cases is achievable in current conditions.**  
CDC reports **2,280 in 2025**, far beyond prior decades. That materially raises the prior probability that 2026 could also be a very high year (persistence/clustering of rare events).

3) **Conditioning on 2026 already being at 910 by Feb 12 makes the 2,000-by-Apr-24 threshold “reachable with ordinary high-outbreak-weekly incidence.”**  
Needing ~109/week for 10 weeks is demanding but not absurd given that outbreaks can generate triple-digit weekly incidence nationally. Importantly, the CDC notes that most 2026 cases so far are outbreak-associated and many are tied to outbreaks that began in 2025—suggesting ongoing chains rather than isolated importations.

4) **Key outside-view uncertainty: outbreak decay vs continued propagation.**  
Large measles outbreaks can slow sharply once (i) susceptible clusters are partly saturated and/or (ii) aggressive vaccination/quarantine measures bite. If that happens quickly nationwide, weekly incidence could fall below the ~109/week needed. Conversely, if transmission continues through spring in multiple under-immunized networks (and/or new outbreaks seed), the threshold is likely to be crossed.

Overall, the outside view—anchored on (i) existence of a 2025 mega-year and (ii) exceptionally high early-2026 cumulative count—leans **more likely than not** toward reaching 2,000 by Apr 24, but not near-certainty because outbreak trajectories can bend downward fast once interventions intensify.

Outside view calibration:

- **Tether to a concrete figure:** The cleanest tether is: **910 cases by Feb 12**; need **+1,090** by Apr 24 (~10 weeks) ⇒ **~109/week**.  
- **Upset rate / surprise potential:** Infectious-disease outbreak trajectories have **high variance** and are sensitive to interventions and behavior changes. Even when early counts are high, it’s common to see nonlinear slowdowns. This argues against pushing to 90–95% unless we have strong evidence that incidence is still accelerating (which would be more “inside view”).  
- **Markets/expert consensus:** None provided directly (no prediction markets cited). Expert quotes generally suggest concern/continued growth, but translating that into a near-certain ≥2,000-by-April outcome would be overconfident.

Net: I calibrate to a probability in the high-70s/low-80s—i.e., favored, but with substantial mass on “contained enough to fall short.”

Outside View Prediction:
**79.2%**
