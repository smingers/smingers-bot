Analysis:

1. Source analysis (abbrev.)

• CDC “Measles Cases and Outbreaks” weekly table, update posted 13 Feb 2026 (data through 12 Feb).  
  – Factual: 2026 YTD = 910 cases, 90 % linked to outbreaks begun 2025, 2025 total = 2 280.  
  – Highest-quality primary source; supplies the metric used for resolution.

• NBC News 13 Feb 2026 data graphic.  
  – Mirrors CDC count (“> 900”), gives weekly increments (279 cases in first full week).  
  – Good secondary; no new numbers beyond CDC.

• iHeart / WMT & CBS pieces 13 Feb 2026.  
  – Quote CDC figure 988 cases and list 24 affected states; detail South-Carolina 847-case cluster.  
  – Useful colour; numbers consistent with CDC daily press note (slightly ahead of weekly table).

• ASTHO blog 21 Jan 2026 & Global News 8 Jan 2026.  
  – Retrospective 2025 totals (2 144–2 280) and vaccination coverage 92.5 %.  
  – Solid institutional sources; information is factual and dated.

• WHO/PAHO & other articles on loss of elimination status.  
  – Support the inference that outbreaks are prolonged and multi-state.  
  – Opinions from named experts; moderate evidential weight.

Overall: all numeric counts trace back to CDC surveillance; non-CDC pieces mainly descriptive.

2. Evidence analysis (strength tags)

Strong  
S1. CDC confirms 910–988 measles cases by 12–13 Feb 2026.  
S2. 2025 produced 2 200 + U.S. cases despite intensive response, showing that present conditions can sustain large numbers.

Moderate  
M1. South-Carolina outbreak (≈ 850 cases) still adding > 15 cases/day (state DoH).  
M2. National MMR coverage 92.5 % – structurally below 95 % herd-immunity threshold and falling.  
M3. Seasonality: measles transmission historically peaks late-winter/early-spring in temperate U.S.

Weak  
W1. Possible surge-dampening from emergency vaccination drives announced but not yet quantified.  
W2. Media speculation about behavioural change following RFK Jr. criticism; impact unclear.

3. Timeframe analysis

• Days to resolution count (13 Feb → 24 Apr): 71 days ≈ 10 weeks.  
• Need ≈ 1 000 additional cases (2 000 – ~ 990) ⇒ ≥ 100 per week.  
• Average so far in 2026 ≈ 150/week.  

If the horizon were halved (5 weeks) the target would demand 200/wk and probability would drop about 20 pts. If doubled (20 weeks) the event would be almost certain (> 95 %) because only 50/week would be required.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment

Base outside view (pre-adjustment): 79 %.

Shifters upward  
+4 %  Current weekly incidence (≈ 150) already exceeds the 100/wk required.  
+3 %  Spring seasonality (M3) historically sustains or amplifies measles spread through April.  
+2 %  Vaccination gap (M2) is a slow-moving structural factor; unlikely to mend in 10 weeks.

Shifters downward  
–2 %  Some outbreaks may soon crest; CDC & states have begun ring-vaccination and school-exclusion orders.  
–1 %  Reporting lag: early-year counts slightly inflated by back-reporting of late-2025 onsets.

Net adjustment: +6 % ⇒ 85 %.

5. Stake analysis for Yes vs No

Yes path: status-quo weekly incidence ≥ 100 continues; South-Carolina cluster unresolved; at least one new state-level outbreak (Utah/Florida campuses) adds > 200 cases.  
No path: rapid containment of SC hotspot, no large secondary seeding, weekly incidence falls below 50 by mid-March.

Probability calibration

“About 85 out of 100 times that the U.S. begins mid-February with ~1 000 confirmed measles cases, it will cross 2 000 by 24 April under present response intensity.”

Checklist:

1. Paraphrase – “Will CDC cumulative U.S. measles cases in 2026 reach ≥ 2 000 by 24 Apr 2026?”  
2. Outside view base rate: 79 %.  
3. Consistency line above.  
4. Key evidence (≤ 20 words each):  
   – 988 cases already by 13 Feb (CDC).  
   – Need only 100/week vs current 150/week.  
   – 2025 managed 2 280 despite controls.  
   – Vaccination coverage 92.5 %, under herd-immunity threshold.  
   – Measles season peaks Feb-Apr.  
5. Blind-spot: SC outbreak burns out in two weeks due to emergency coverage; national weekly count plunges to < 40. Could drop probability by ~25 pts.  
6. Status-quo: continuation of current trend favours Yes; short horizon limits policy reversal impact.

Probability: 85%
