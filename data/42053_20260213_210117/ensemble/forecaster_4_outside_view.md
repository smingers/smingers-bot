Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. CDC “Measles Cases and Outbreaks” page (data as of 12 Feb 2026).  
 • Highest-quality primary surveillance data; updated weekly; purely factual case counts, no opinion.  
2. ABC News piece (12 Feb 2026).  
 • Secondary reporting that accurately echoes CDC numbers; includes some expert quotes (infectious-disease physicians). Facts (jurisdictions, vaccination status) agree with CDC; opinions confined to quoted experts.  
3. CNN article (27 Jan 2026).  
 • Timely, generally reliable national outlet. Factual elements (size of South Carolina outbreak, federal assistance) cite official state or federal spokespeople; quoted opinions from CDC officials and physicians are identified experts.  
4. NPR article (31 Jan 2026).  
 • Reputable public-radio journalism. Factual statistics sourced to state health depts./CDC; contains expert commentary from Johns Hopkins, CDC leadership.  
5. CDC “Global Measles Outbreaks” note (11 Feb 2026).  
 • Authoritative but provides only background context on international importations; no U.S. 2026 counts.  
6. Agent report (LLM-generated synthesis).  
 • Useful collation of historical CDC data (2010-2023) and timeline narrative. Numbers for 2010-2023 trace back to archived CDC/MMWR tables and match publicly available figures; nevertheless treated with slightly more caution than the direct CDC page.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. All U.S. measles years since elimination (2000-2025). 26 observations; none exceeded 2 000 cases by 24 Apr.  
2. High-incidence elimination-era years (2014, 2019, 2025). Gives a sample of three “big years.” Among them 0/3 hit 2 000 by 24 Apr.  
3. Years that began with ≥400 cases by 31 Jan (only 2025 and 2026). 1/1 known observation (2025) still failed to cross 2 000 by 24 Apr.  

Because the event we are forecasting is extreme, the “high-incidence elimination-era years” (class 2) is the most informative realistic baseline—big but not unprecedented seasons.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today ➝ 24 Apr 2026 = 71 days ≈ 10 weeks.  
Historical pace in big years:  
 – 2019: 695 cases by 26 Apr (≈ 55 % of eventual 1 274).  
 – 2025: ~500 cases by 24 Apr (≈ 22 % of eventual 2 280).  
Current year: 910 cases already by 12 Feb—no prior year had reached even 500 this early. To reach 2 000 by 24 Apr requires +1 090 cases, i.e., an average ≈ 109 per week.  

(d) Justification  
Base rate: 0/26 years ⇒ Laplace-adjusted 1/28 ≈ 3.6 % for “≥2 000 by 24 Apr.”

Conditioning on an unprecedented early-year total:  
• Observed January–early-February growth in 2026 ≈ 150–175 cases/week (CNN, ABC, CDC weekly increases).  
• Maintaining even a reduced 120/week would clear the threshold; a halving to 75/week would not.  
• Containment realities: The dominant South Carolina chain shows signs of ongoing school transmission; federal response is modest; vaccine uptake in core communities is still below herd-immunity level. Rapid shutdown in the next few weeks therefore seems uncertain but not impossible (historically some U.S. clusters have plateaued once ~80-90 % of the susceptible pocket was infected).  

Combining: start with 3–4 % base; multiply by a factor of roughly 10–12 to account for the very rare condition “already 900+ cases by mid-Feb” (reflecting that only in such a situation could the target be physically attainable). That yields an outside-view probability in the high 30 % range before looking at any finer-grain outbreak or policy details.

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor: 0/26 raw base ⇒ 3.6 %.  
• Adjustment for unprecedented early count: +22 log-odds points (≈ × 12 on odds), taking us to ~38 %.  
• Upset frequency: Public-health surprises (e.g., 2019 outbreak) occur about once per decade; we temper by shaving 2 percentage points for general uncertainty in real-time surveillance (potential later downgrades of suspected cases).
