Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, abridged)

1. CDC “Measles Cases and Outbreaks” page, update posted 13 Feb 2026 – primary surveillance; shows 988 cumulative U.S. 2026 cases. Very high-quality, factual, no opinion.
2. NBC News data graphic, 13 Feb 2026 – re-states CDC numbers, adds weekly totals and state break-downs; reputable national outlet, minor commentary clearly separable.
3. iHeart / NewsRadio article, 13 Feb 2026 – matches CDC 988-case figure; details South Carolina (847 cases, +58 in 3 days). Local radio site, factual data attributed to SC DPH & CDC.
4. CBS News, 13 Feb 2026 – confirms “over 1 000” 2026 cases and Florida university cluster (~60 cases). National TV news; credible.
5. ASTHO blog, 21 Jan 2026 – gives final 2025 total (2 144) and outlines falling kindergarten MMR coverage (92.5 %). Trade association; data traceable to CDC.
6. The Hill, 23 Jan 2026 – 416 2026 cases at that date, 2 255 in 2025; mainstream political news site referencing CDC.
7. WHO/CDC global-outbreak page, 11 Feb 2026 – global context; high quality, factual.

All other AskNews items repeat the same CDC counts or offer local colour. Factual material is highly concordant across sources; opinions largely limited to expert warnings about elimination status.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighed)

Strong evidence
• CDC surveillance already lists 988 cases on 13 Feb 2026 (confirmed, nationwide).  
• Weekly incidence: 279 new cases in first full week of 2026 (NBC/CDC) – establishes current pace.  
• Historical precedent: 2025 added >1 300 cases after mid-February, ending at 2 144 (ASTHO/CDC).  
• Structural driver: national kindergarten MMR coverage 92.5 % (ASTHO) – durable, hard to change in 10 weeks.

Moderate evidence
• South Carolina outbreak still accelerating (+58 in 3 days – iHeart).  
• Multiple new state clusters (Florida, Utah, California) suggest wider seeding (CBS, The Hill).  
• Intensified containment – quarantines, emergency vaccination clinics (various state press releases) – logical but impact uncertain in short horizon.

Weak evidence
• Speculation that “depletion of susceptibles” will soon slow SC outbreak – anecdotal, no data.  
• Political commentary linking policy changes to case counts – irrelevant to 10-week horizon.

(c) Time-frame analysis

Time to resolution: 70 days (≈10 weeks).  
Need ≥1 012 additional cases (≥101/week).  
Status-quo weekly pace (~275) would breach 2 000 in 4 weeks; halving the period (35 days) still allows ~960 expected new cases at current pace – already near the threshold. If period were doubled (140 days) probability would rise further toward certainty unless extraordinary control succeeds.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Start from outside-view base rate: 54 %.

Upward adjustments
+10 pp Current caseload very high (988) and weekly incidence 2.7× the minimum needed.  
+8 pp Evidence of multiple independent state outbreaks with school-age concentration, historically hard to contain quickly.  
+4 pp Spring-break travel and PAHO-review deadline (mid-April) will occur before resolution, raising importations and delaying relaxation of control measures.

Downward adjustments
-6 pp Aggressive public-health response now fully mobilised; SC schools closed, vaccine clinics expanding – could cut Rₑ < 1 within weeks.  
-3 pp Possible reporting lag/re-classification (a few per-cent of suspected cases historically dropped).

Net inside-view shift: +13 pp → 67 %.

Regression toward uncertainty (2/3 weight on 67 %, 1/3 on outside 54 %) to temper over-fitting: 0.67×67 % + 0.33×54 % ≈ 63 %.

Rounded to nearest whole number not ending in 0 or 5 to avoid false precision cues: 64 %.

Probability calibration

I expect that about 64 out of 100 times, the CDC cumulative measles count for 2026 will reach or exceed 2 000 by 24 Apr 2026.

Checklist:

1. Restatement – “By 24 Apr 2026 will CDC show ≥2 000 confirmed U.S. measles cases accumulated during 2026?”  
2. Outside-view base: 54 %.  
3. Consistency – “64/100 times the count hits 2 000.”  
4. Key evidence (20 wds max each)  
   • 988 cases already recorded by 13 Feb.  
   • 279 new cases in first 2026 week.  
   • 2025 added >1 300 cases post-mid-Feb.  
   • National MMR coverage 92.5 %.  
   • SC outbreak still >50 new cases every 3 days.  
5. Blind-spot – Swift containment in SC and no large secondary clusters cuts weekly cases <60; probability would drop below 40 %.  
6. Status-quo – Current growth unchanged → threshold crossed well before deadline; slight reversion to mean already applied.

Probability: 64%
