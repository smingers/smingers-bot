Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. CDC “Measles Cases and Outbreaks” page, update of 13 Feb 2026 (data through 12 Feb 2026). Primary surveillance source; 910 confirmed U.S. 2026 cases, 5 new 2026 outbreaks, 90 % outbreak-associated. Highest-quality, near-real-time, no evident bias.  
2. ABC News story (13 Feb 2026). Re-states the CDC numbers and lists the 24 affected jurisdictions. Adds contextual quotations; factual data all traceable to CDC, opinion content easily separable. Medium-quality popular press.  
3. CNN article (27 Jan 2026). Details the South Carolina outbreak (789 cases), quotes named CDC and state officials. Good on-the-ground facts, still secondary.  
4. NPR article (31 Jan 2026). Describes risk to U.S. elimination status; gives 847 South Carolina cases and several interstate links. Quotes infectious-disease experts. Reliable journalism; facts consistent with CDC.  
5. CDC “Global measles outbreaks” page (11 Feb 2026). Background on global epidemiology; high-quality but not specific to U.S. 2026 forecast window.  
6. CDC FastStats measles page (archived 2019 data). Historical baseline; authoritative.  
7. Agent_report (13 Feb 2026). Collates yearly U.S. totals 2010-2025 from CDC and reproduces 2026 cumulative of 910. Synthesises outbreak narratives. Because it is a compilation, figures must be cross-checked (they match CDC numbers); still useful.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
1. All U.S. measles years since elimination (2000-2023). 0/24 years exceeded 2 000 cases by any date—base-rate for threshold ≈0 %.  Not ideal because present conditions (large ongoing outbreaks, lowered coverage) are unprecedented relative to most of the series.  
2. High-outbreak modern years (2014, 2019, 2024, 2025). 1/4 years (2025) ultimately exceeded 2 000, but not by April. Gives 25 % base-rate.  
3. Years that began with ≥500 cases by mid-February (only 2026 fits; 2025 had roughly 300). Lacks sample size.  
Given the uniqueness of the current surge, the most informative baseline is class 2, then adjusted by the extraordinary early-year pace (see inside-view later). I therefore adopt class 2 (recent high-outbreak years) as the outside-view anchor, base-rate ≈ 25 %.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Today → resolution date: 13 Feb → 24 Apr 2026 = 70 days, ~10 weeks.  
Historical growth patterns:  
• 2025 added ~1 000 cases between 1 Mar and 31 May (≈11 weeks) while West Texas outbreak was expanding.  
• 2019 added ~900 cases during its fastest 10-week stretch (March-May).  
Thus, adding ≥1 090 cases in 10 weeks is not unheard-of and has occurred once (2025) and nearly occurred once (2019) under less favourable initial conditions.

(d) Justification for the outside-view probability  
Status quo baseline: 910 cases already booked. To reach 2 000 by 24 Apr we need ≥1 090 additional cases, i.e. ≥77 per week. The current observed average since 1 Jan is ≈150-170 per week (CDC weekly increments). Even a 50 % slowdown would clear the threshold.  
Factors favouring continued high incidence (Yes-drivers):  
• South Carolina chain still growing; household- and school-level R effective appears >1 per CNN/NPR coverage.  
• Spill-over to at least five other states; susceptible pockets exist (MMR kindergarten coverage 92.5 %).  
• Spring-break travel (mid-March–early April) historically seeds new clusters.  
Factors favouring sharp slowdown (No-drivers):  
• Intensified containment: CDC plus $1.4 million federal aid, quarantines in 20+ schools.  
• Possible depletion of susceptibles in the hardest-hit communities after 2025-26 transmission.  
• Heightened media attention could spur catch-up vaccination.  
Upset frequency: In modern U.S. data 2014-2023, public-health interventions usually capped annual totals below 700. Outliers 2019 and 2025 show that once large unvaccinated pockets are involved, control can fail. Roughly 2 out of the last 10 years produced a major upside surprise; I incorporate that 20 % “surprise” rate as a sanity check against overconfidence.

Outside view calibration:
Anchor: 25 % (reference class 2).  
Adjust up because:  
• Unprecedented early-year caseload: +25 pp.  
• Current weekly incidence already double what is needed: +15 pp.  
Adjust down because:  
• Uncertain effect of aggressive containment and quarantines: -8 pp.  
• Chance of data revision / delayed confirmation reducing counted cases before 24 Apr: -2 pp.  
Net outside-view probability ≈25 + 25 + 15 - 8 - 2 = 55 %.  
I then widen for tail risk (both up and down) using the historical “surprise” frequency, regressing 10 % toward 50 %: (55 × 0.8) + 50 × 0.2 = 54 %.  
Finally round to the nearest whole percent but not to a multiple of five: 54 %.

Outside View Prediction:
54 %
