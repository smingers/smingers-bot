You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the CDC-reported cumulative number of confirmed U.S. measles cases in 2026, as of April 24, 2026, be at least 2,000?

Question background:
A very high measles case count would indicate a major outbreak year with implications for vaccination campaigns, public health capacity, and travel/education policy.

## Key Statistics for 2024 (for comparison):

- **Total confirmed measles cases in 2024: 285**
  - 269 cases from 32 jurisdictions
  - 16 cases among international visitors
- **Outbreaks in 2024:** 16 outbreaks
- **Outbreak-associated cases:** 69% (198 of 285 cases)
- **Hospitalization rate:** 40% (114 of 285 cases)

## Vaccination Coverage Data:

- MMR vaccination coverage among U.S. kindergartners has **decreased from 95.2% (2019-2020 school year) to 92.5% (2024-2025 school year)**
- This leaves approximately **286,000 kindergartners at risk** during the 2024-2025 school year
- Community immunity (herd immunity) requires >95% vaccination coverage

## Vaccine Effectiveness:

- Two doses of MMR vaccine: 97% effective at preventing measles
- One dose: 93% effective
- Breakthrough infections occur in approximately 10% of all measles infections

## Important Notes:

- The article states that "2025–2026 case counts are preliminary and subject to change"
- CDC only reports confirmed cases (not probable cases)
- Data is updated weekly reflecting confirmed cases notified to CDC as of noon on Thursdays
- Measles was eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 (no endemic transmission)

## Historical Context:

- 2023: 59 cases
- 2022: 121 cases
- 2021: 49 cases
- 2020: 13 cases
- 2019: 1,274 cases

**Relevance to forecasting question:** As of February 12, 2026, there were 910 confirmed cases. The question asks about the cumulative count as of April 24, 2026, requiring at least 2,000 cases for a "Yes" resolution. This would require an additional 1,090+ cases in approximately 10 weeks.

  - 94% are unvaccinated or have unknown vaccination status
  - 2% received one MMR dose
  - 3% received two MMR doses
  - Only 6 cases were from international visitors

- **Demographics:** Majority of cases occur among patients under 19 years old

- **Hospitalization rate:** About 3% of all measles patients have been hospitalized

- **Vaccine effectiveness:** One MMR dose is 93% effective; two doses are 97% effective against measles

- **Vaccination rates (kindergartners):**
  - 2024-2025 school year: 92.5%
  - 2023-2024 school year: 92.7%
  - 2019-2020 school year: 95.2%

**Notable Outbreaks:**

- **South Carolina outbreak:** Began last year, with 933 cases confirmed as of Tuesday, mostly centered around Spartanburg County

# Summary of CNN Article on South Carolina Measles Outbreak

**Date:** January 27, 2026

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **South Carolina outbreak size:** 789 cases reported as of Tuesday (January 27, 2026)
   - This is the largest outbreak since measles was declared eliminated in the US in 2000
   - Surpasses previous record of 762 cases in Texas outbreak (ended August 2025)

   - No deaths reported in South Carolina
   - Two children died during the Texas outbreak

3. **Quarantines and exposures:**
   - 557 people in quarantine in South Carolina
   - Exposures at 23 schools total (3 additional reported Tuesday, plus 20 existing)

4. **National measles data:**
   - US reported more than 2,200 confirmed measles cases in 2025 (significantly more than any year since 2000)
   - Average of about 180 measles cases per year since elimination (pre-2025)
   - CDC reported 416 confirmed measles cases in US so far in 2026 (as of Thursday before South Carolina's latest numbers)
   - At least 14 states have reported confirmed cases in 2026
   - Another large outbreak continues along Arizona-Utah border
   - Cases in North Carolina, Washington, and California linked to South Carolina outbreak

5. **Vaccination status:**
   - Of 789 South Carolina cases, more than 700 were not vaccinated or had not received two MMR doses
   - Vast majority of cases are among children, nearly all not fully vaccinated
   - Spartanburg County (outbreak epicenter): 90% of students had required immunizations in 2024-25 school year (among lowest in state)
   - Some schools in Spartanburg County report much lower rates

6. **Federal response:**
   - US Department of Health and Human Services providing $1.4 million in requested aid to South Carolina
   - CDC working with state health officials on investigation and coordination

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

- **Dr. Anna Kathryn Rye Burch** (pediatric infectious diseases physician, Prisma Health, South Carolina): Expressed heartbreak over outbreak, attributed it to declining vaccine enthusiasm

- **Dr. Ralph Abraham** (CDC Principal Deputy Director, former Louisiana surgeon general): 
  - Argued ongoing measles transmission from Texas outbreak has not been proved

  - Noted "We have these communities that choose to be unvaccinated. That's their personal freedom"
  - Stated "vaccination remains the most effective way to prevent measles"
  - Said CDC is willing to listen to alternatives "for treatment and prevention"

- **Dr. Linda Bell** (State Epidemiologist, South Carolina): Encouraged vaccination to stop outbreak and protect communities

- **Public health experts** (unnamed): Say 95% vaccination rate typically needed to keep measles from spreading due to virus being highly contagious

## Context:

- Measles declared eliminated in US in 2000 (no continuous transmission for more than a year at a time)
- Pan American Health Organization could revoke elimination status when it meets in April 2026
- HHS Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr. is described as "a longtime vaccine skeptic" who has focused on unconventional treatments including vitamin A, a steroid, and an antibiotic

# Summary of "Global Measles Outbreaks" (CDC, February 11, 2026)

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Global measles burden (2023)**: An estimated 10.3 million people were infected with measles globally in 2023.

2. **Current global situation**: As of February 2026, measles outbreaks are occurring in every region of the world.

3. **U.S. measles elimination status**: Measles was declared eliminated in the United States in 2000, but cases and outbreaks continue due to unvaccinated international travelers.

4. **Historical U.S. outbreak reference**: In 2019, the U.S. nearly lost its elimination status with almost 1,300 measles cases from a large outbreak in New York plus cases in 30 additional states.

5. **Recent trend**: After a decrease in global measles incidence during the COVID-19 pandemic, measles activity globally and in the United States continues to rise.

6. **Top 10 countries with measles outbreaks (July-December 2025)**:
   - Yemen: 11,288 cases
   - Indonesia: 10,744 cases
   - India: 9,666 cases
   - Pakistan: 7,361 cases

# Summary of NPR Article: "The U.S. will likely lose its measles elimination status. Here's what that means"

**Date:** January 31, 2026  
**Author:** Maria Godoy

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **South Carolina Outbreak:**
   - 847 confirmed cases since October (first case reported)
   - 58 new cases reported on Friday (since Tuesday)
   - Outbreak grew in just 16 weeks, faster than the Texas outbreak which took 7 months
   - Vast majority of cases are in unvaccinated children and teens
   - About two dozen schools under quarantine
   - Cases also reported at Clemson University and Anderson University

2. **Spread Beyond South Carolina:**
   - North Carolina has confirmed several cases linked to the South Carolina outbreak
   - Washington state (Snohomish County): 6 measles cases in unvaccinated children linked to a family visiting from South Carolina

3. **U.S. Measles Elimination Status:**
   - The U.S. clock for potential loss of elimination status started in January 2025 with the Texas outbreak
   - Elimination status requires going a year without continuous chain of transmission
   - PAHO (Pan American Health Organization) plans to review U.S. measles elimination status this spring
   - The U.S. maintained elimination status for 25 years (since 2000)

4. **Vaccination Rates:**
   - Spartanburg County, S.C.: 90% schoolwide vaccination rate for required immunizations
   - Nationwide: 92.5% of kindergartners received measles vaccine in 2024-2025 school year
   - Ideal vaccination rate to prevent outbreaks: 95% or more

5. **Measles Characteristics:**
   - Two doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective at providing lifelong immunity
   - One infected person can sicken up to 18 other unvaccinated people on average
   - Contagious from 4 days before rash appears until 4 days after
   - Infectious particles can linger in air for up to 2 hours

6. **Economic Impact:**
   - Average cost per measles case: $43,000
   - Outbreaks of 50+ cases can cost well over $1 million total

## Named Expert Opinions:

- **Dr. Linda Bell (South Carolina state epidemiologist):** Expressed concern about the rapid trajectory of the outbreak and uncertainty about the final case count

- **Dr. Demetre Daskalakis (infectious disease specialist, former CDC official):** "We do not have the capability to actually control measles... So I'm going to say that elimination is already lost." He attributes the resurgence to misinformation undermining vaccine trust.

- **Dr. Ralph Abraham (CDC principal deputy director):** When asked if losing elimination status was significant, said "Not really." Stated it wouldn't impact how the administration tackles measles. Emphasized "religious freedom, health freedom, personal freedom" and respecting communities that "choose to go a somewhat of a different route."

- **Caitlin Rivers (epidemiologist, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health):** Views potential loss of elimination status as "really a comment on the state of the public health system" and evidence of "the cycle of panic and neglect."

- **Dr. William Moss (International Vaccine Access Center, Johns Hopkins):** Warned that rising cases will lead to more hospitalizations, deaths, and greater toll on the public health system. Also noted that fighting measles diverts resources from other public health priorities.

- **Dr. Anna-Kathryn Burch (pediatric infectious disease specialist, Prisma Health, Columbia, S.C.):** Expressed heartbreak over the outbreak and predicted numbers will continue to grow over the next several months.

## Context:

- The article notes the Trump administration has "taken multiple steps to undermine overall confidence in vaccines"
- Experts attribute outbreaks to communities choosing not to vaccinate
- Measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 by PAHO, but the virus is still endemic in many parts of the world with cases brought in from abroad annually
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide CDC-reported U.S. measles case totals for each year 2010-2025. Also list the 2026 cumulative total as of 13 Feb 2026 and summarize major outbreaks contributing to 2024-2026 figures.
Below is a consolidated year-by-year list of confirmed U.S. measles cases reported by CDC (or CDC-derived tables) together with the most recent 2026 cumulative figure and a narrative of the principal outbreaks that produced the high totals in 2024-2026.

A. CDC-reported U.S. measles case totals, 2010-2026  
(Totals for 2010-2023 come from CDC yearly summaries that are reproduced in the Statista “New cases of measles in the U.S. 1985-2026” data set; 2024-2026 come directly from the current CDC Measles Cases and Outbreaks page.)

Year | Confirmed cases
---- | ---------------
2010 | 63 (Statista, citing CDC)  
2011 | 220 (Statista, citing CDC)  
2012 | 55 (Statista, citing CDC)  
2013 | 187 (Statista, citing CDC)  
2014 | 667 (Statista, citing CDC)  
2015 | 188 (Statista, citing CDC)  
2016 | 86 (Statista, citing CDC)  
2017 | 120 (Statista, citing CDC)  
2018 | 372 (Statista, citing CDC)  
2019 | 1,274 (ASM article quoting CDC & Statista)  
2020 | 13 (Statista, citing CDC)  
2021 | 49 (Statista, citing CDC)  
2022 | 121 (Statista, citing CDC)  
2023 | 59 (CDC page – 4 outbreaks, 59 cases)  
2024 | 285 (CDC page, updated 31 Dec 2024)  
2025 | 2,280 (CDC page, full-year total)  
2026 | 910 (as of 12 Feb 2026, CDC page)

Thus, between 2010 and 2023 the annual case count exceeded 1,000 only once (2019). The jump to 2,280 cases in 2025 represents the highest single-year total since 1992 and dwarfs every year since elimination was declared in 2000.

B. 2026 cumulative total as of 13 Feb 2026  
The CDC “Measles Cases and Outbreaks” update dated 13 Feb 2026 shows 910 confirmed U.S. cases reported in 2026 to date (CDC page, accessed 13 Feb 2026).

C. Major outbreaks that drove the 2024-2026 numbers

1. Calendar year 2024 (285 cases; 16 outbreaks)  
• Size/character: 69 % of cases (198) were outbreak-associated (CDC page).  
• Philadelphia children’s-hospital cluster (January 2024) – sparked by an unvaccinated child returning from overseas; the infection spread in a day-care centre before quarantine was in place (ASM article).  
• Additional small multi-state clusters occurred, but all remained under 50 cases each; no single state exceeded 60 cases.  
• Outcome: although higher than 2023, the total remained far below 2019 and elimination status was maintained.

2. Calendar year 2025 (2,280 cases; 49 outbreaks) – the breakout year  
• West Texas megacluster (February–August 2025): more than 760 confirmed infections and two pediatric deaths; accounted for one-third of the national total (CBS News, 5 Jan 2026).  
• South Carolina outbreak (October–December 2025): >200 confirmed cases, hundreds of student quarantines (Reuters summary in Contagion Live, 13 Feb 2026; ABC News, 23 Dec 2025).  
• Utah-Arizona border outbreak (autumn 2025): multistate chain tied to declining vaccination in polygamous communities; dozens of linked exposure sites (Contagion Live).  
• Numerous smaller outbreaks (≥3 related cases) in 45 jurisdictions; 89 % of all 2025 cases were tied to outbreaks (CDC page).  
• Vaccination status: 92-93 % of 2025 patients were unvaccinated or had unknown status (Contagion Live; CDC).  
• Public-health impact: three U.S. deaths; first time regional elimination status for the Americas was judged lost by PAHO (ASTHO blog, 21 Jan 2026).

3. Calendar year 2026 to date (910 cases through 12 Feb; 5 new 2026 outbreaks, plus spill-over from 2025 chains)  
• Continuing South Carolina transmission: outbreak that began in Oct 2025 grew to 847 confirmed infections by late January 2026 and remains the epicentre (ABC News, 31 Jan 2026; NBC News tracker). Roughly 90 % of 2026 national cases are outbreak-associated, and 760 of those cases belong to outbreaks that technically started in 2025 (CDC page).  
• Maine (February 2026): first state case since 2019 – travel-related adult; illustrates geographic spread beyond the Southeast (Maine DHHS, 6 Feb 2026).  
• Other active jurisdictions include Utah, Arizona, Kentucky, and Minnesota, each reporting school or community exposure events (CDC list of 24 jurisdictions; Contagion Live).  
• Vaccination status remains similar: about 90 % of 2026 cases are in unvaccinated/unknown-status persons (CDC).

D. How these data inform the forecasting question (≥2,000 U.S. cases by 24 Apr 2026?)

Current pace: 910 confirmed cases have accrued in the first 43 calendar days of 2026 (through 12 Feb). 2025 reached ~900 cases only in late May of that year; the 2026 curve is therefore ≈2½ months ahead of last year’s record trajectory. If the current weekly average (~150–175 cases/week since early January, per NBC News weekly tracker) persists or accelerates as winter/spring transmission continues, the cumulative total could exceed 2,000 before mid-April.

However, two uncertainties could slow growth:
• Containment of the South Carolina outbreak – if effective quarantine and catch-up vaccination halt spread, the largest contributing chain could plateau.  
• Possible saturation of susceptible individuals in key under-vaccinated pockets after intense transmission last year.

Conversely, spring break and Easter travel, plus evidence of ongoing household and community exposures in Utah and the Southeast, create upside risk.

E. Remaining information gaps and suggested next searches

1. Source confirmation for the 2010-2022 annual figures. They are widely quoted, but a direct citation from archived CDC web pages or MMWR annual summaries would strengthen provenance beyond the Statista secondary compilation.

2. Up-to-the-minute 2026 figures. The CDC page is updated weekly (Thursday). Close to the 24 Apr deadline, forecasters will need the exact CDC count posted for that day.

3. Detailed epidemic curves for South Carolina, Texas 2025, and Utah/Arizona to allow modelling of prospective incident cases.

Given those gaps, one additional round of searching could target:
• Google: CDC measles annual cases archive 2010 site:cdc.gov  
• Google News: South Carolina measles outbreak February 2026 update  
• Google: MMWR measles United States 2012 update  
• Google: Utah measles wastewater February 2026  
(No further queries are executed here; listed only for completeness.)

In summary, CDC-reported measles cases were relatively modest from 2010-2023, surged to 285 in 2024, exploded to 2,280 in 2025 due chiefly to West Texas and South Carolina outbreaks, and have already reached 910 by 13 Feb 2026 with South Carolina still driving transmission. Unless containment sharply improves, the country is on pace to surpass 2,000 cases well before 24 Apr 2026.</Agent_report>
