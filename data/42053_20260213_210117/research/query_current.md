Analysis:
The threshold of 2,000 U.S. measles cases by 24 Apr 2026 is far above any annual total seen since endemic measles was eliminated in 2000 (the 2019 spike reached 1,282). To judge whether 2026 might reach that level, I need: 1) the CDC’s year-to-date count for 2026; 2) the weekly or bi-weekly growth rate so far this year; 3) reports of large, multi-state outbreaks, especially in under-immunised communities; 4) indications that international importations are rising or that vaccine-exemption laws have loosened; and 5) expert or CDC commentary on expected trajectory for the remainder of the spring. Current news and CDC updates are therefore essential.
