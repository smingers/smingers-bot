Analysis:
To form an outside view I need to know how large U.S. measles outbreaks have been historically, how often annual totals have ever approached 2,000, and what the trajectory usually looks like by late April. Key context therefore includes: (a) CDC-reported annual measles case totals for at least the past 15 years; (b) year-to-date tallies early in the calendar year for recent outbreaks (e.g., 2014, 2019, 2024-2026); and (c) current 2026 reports in news sources describing where and how rapidly cases are accumulating. These data will indicate how unprecedented a 2,000-case total would be and whether 2026 is currently tracking toward that magnitude.
