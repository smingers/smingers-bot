South Carolina is the epicenter, with 847 cases concentrated in Spartanburg County, including a 58-case increase in three days, indicating rapid community transmission. The South Carolina Department of Public Health warned that the number of public exposure sites shows measles is actively circulating, increasing infection risks for those not immune. Of the infected, 93% were unvaccinated or had unknown vaccination status; 85% were 19 years old or younger, with 27% aged 5 or younger. Declining MMR vaccination rates are cited as the cause: coverage among U.S. kindergartners dropped from 95.2% in 2019\u201320 to 92.5% in 2024\u201325, leaving approximately 286,000 children vulnerable. Measles is highly contagious, capable of infecting up to 18 others in an unvaccinated population, and can remain airborne for up to two hours. Symptoms begin like a cold\u2014cough, runny nose, red eyes\u2014before a rash appears, and individuals are contagious four days before the rash develops. Complications include pneumonia and rare neurological disorders. Public health officials stress that two doses of the MMR vaccine are 97% effective at preventing measles.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 06:56 PM\nSource:[AM 600 WMT -  NewsRadio](https://600wmtradio.iheart.com/content/2026-02-13-measles-cases-in-us-approach-1000-as-infections-spread-across-24-states/)\n\n**Measles cases at university in Florida soar to nearly 60 amid growing outbreaks nationwide**\nMeasles cases in the United States have surged, with at least 21 states reporting confirmed cases as outbreaks continue to spread nationwide. At Ave Maria University in Florida, cases have risen to nearly 60, including an unvaccinated sophomore who described initial symptoms resembling a head cold, followed by a rash, sore throat, and cough. Dr. Raul Enad, a local clinician, treated both a vaccinated student and a vaccinated professor who contracted the virus after contact with an infected individual; he emphasized that vaccination likely prevented more severe illness. The university stated that the health and safety of its campus community remain a top priority. The U.S. now faces the risk of losing its measles-elimination status for the first time in over 20 years. According to CDC principal deputy director Ralph Abraham, porous international borders and unvaccinated communities contribute to the resurgence. CBS News has tracked over 1,000 confirmed cases in 2026\u2014approximately half the number recorded in all of 2025. Three years ago, there were only two cases at this time of year. South Carolina has the largest outbreak, with over 900 cases since September. The CDC recommends the first MMR vaccine dose between 12 and 15 months of age. FDA Commissioner Dr. Marty Makary stressed the importance of the measles vaccine, calling it a core essential vaccine.

If the trend continues, this year could surpass last year\u2019s total of 2,274 cases, the highest in 33 years. Cases have been reported in 23 of 50 states, with South Carolina (605 cases), Utah (77), and Florida (68) being the hardest hit. California reported its first case in six years. The majority of patients are children and adolescents under 20: 57% are aged 5\u201319, and 28% are under 5. Notably, 95% of infected individuals had never received a measles vaccine. Measles is highly contagious, with over 90% of susceptible individuals becoming infected after exposure. The U.S. achieved measles elimination status in 2000 through widespread vaccination, but the MMR vaccination rate among kindergartners dropped from 95.2% in 2019\u20132020 to 92.5% over the past five years\u2014below the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity. The CDC warns that sustained transmission for over a year could result in the U.S. losing its measles elimination status. Some experts attribute the decline in vaccination rates to vaccine skepticism promoted during the Donald Trump administration, including the appointment of vaccine skeptic Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services, which led to reduced pediatric vaccine recommendations and the defunding of pediatric advocacy groups critical of anti-vaccine policies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 05:36 AM\nSource:[\uacbd\ud5a5\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.khan.co.kr/en/article/202602131421037)\n\n**Measles Outbreak Surges in the U.S., With Nearly 900 Cases Reported This Year**\nIn the United States, measles cases have surged significantly this year, with 896 confirmed infections reported nationwide from the beginning of the year to February 12, 2026\u2014429 more than the average for the same period over the past decade. If this trend continues, the number could surpass last year\u2019s total of 2,274 cases, the highest in 33 years.

Notably, 95% of infected individuals had never received a measles vaccine. Measles is a highly contagious respiratory illness spread through the air; unvaccinated individuals have over a 90% chance of infection upon exposure, but it is preventable through vaccination. The U.S. had achieved measles elimination status in 2000 due to widespread vaccination, but declining vaccination rates have led to a resurgence. The MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine coverage among kindergarten students dropped from 95.2% in the 2019\u20132020 school year to 92.5% in five years, below the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity. The CDC warns that if outbreaks persist for over a year, the U.S. could lose its measles-free status. Some critics attribute the worsening situation to vaccine skepticism promoted during the Trump administration, including the appointment of anti-vaccine figure Robert F. Kennedy Jr. as Secretary of Health and Human Services, the reduction of recommended childhood vaccine doses, and the termination of funding for the American Academy of Pediatrics, a vocal advocate for vaccination. Additionally, the FDA recently rejected Moderna\u2019s mRNA flu vaccine application, citing concerns amid broader skepticism toward vaccines under the Trump administration.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 04:44 AM\nSource:[\uacbd\ud5a5\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.khan.co.kr/article/202602131344001)\n\n**Measles Outbreak in the U.S. Surges Amid Declining Vaccine Confidence**\nThe United States is experiencing a significant rise in measles cases, with 896 confirmed infections reported from January to February 12, 2026\u2014429 more than the average for the same period over the past 10 years. The outbreak is widespread, affecting 23 of 50 states, with South Carolina reporting the highest number at 605 cases, followed by Utah (77) and Florida (68).

The CDC warns that sustained measles outbreaks could cause the U.S. to lose its measles-free status. The rise in vaccine skepticism, particularly during the Trump administration, is cited as a contributing factor. Trump appointed Robert F. Kennedy Jr., a prominent vaccine skeptic, as Secretary of Health and Human Services, leading to reduced vaccine recommendations and funding cuts to pediatric medical associations critical of anti-vaccine policies.

In 2026, more cases were reported in the first month than in a typical full year, raising alarm among public health officials. A major outbreak in West Texas accounted for at least one-third of all 2025 cases, with multiple states reporting linked cases; although the Texas outbreak was declared over in mid-August 2025, new outbreaks continue to grow, including the largest in decades in South Carolina, which began in October 2025. Measles, a highly contagious airborne disease, primarily affects unvaccinated individuals under age 20. Symptoms include fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, and a red rash. Complications include pneumonia in about 1 in 20 cases and encephalitis in some, with up to 3 in 1,000 children dying from respiratory or neurological complications. The MMR vaccine is highly effective\u201493% effective with one dose and 97% with two doses\u2014recommended at 12\u201315 months and 4\u20136 years.

Vaccination rates vary widely by state, and the United States has fallen below the 95% target needed to maintain herd immunity. The CDC warns that if an outbreak persists for a year or more, the U.S. could lose its measles elimination status, which was officially recognized in 2000.

The country has a cumulative incidence rate of 6.7 measles cases per 100,000 inhabitants. President Claudia Sheinbaum stated that Mexico has 28 million measles vaccines available, declaring they are 'sufficient, and there will even be some left over.'

California reports first since 2020**\nEight measles cases in Shasta County, Northern California, have been classified as an outbreak by state health officials, marking the first such outbreak in the state since 2020. A total of 17 measles cases have been reported statewide, including in Los Angeles, Orange, San Bernardino, Riverside, and Shasta counties. All eight cases in Shasta County are linked and involve individuals who were either unvaccinated or had an unknown vaccination history. Two infected individuals visited Disneyland on January 22 and January 28 while infectious. The California Department of Public Health is urging residents to ensure their measles vaccinations are up to date, citing a national surge in cases. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines an outbreak as a sudden, unexpected increase in cases within a defined area or time period, while an epidemic is more widespread and a pandemic spans multiple continents. Measles, a highly contagious virus that spreads through the air, can cause serious complications such as pneumonia, encephalitis, blindness, and death, especially in children under five. Although measles was declared eliminated in the U.S. in 2000, the country is now experiencing its highest case numbers in over 30 years, driven by low vaccination rates and global outbreaks. South Carolina has reported over 920 cases, one of the largest outbreaks in decades. Experts like Dr. Peter Chin-Hong warn that the U.S. may lose its elimination status by 2025 or 2026 if sustained local transmission continues for more than 12 months without external introduction. The CDC recommends two doses of the MMR vaccine\u2014first between 12 to 15 months and the second between 4 to 6 years\u2014for 97% effectiveness. The vaccine is considered one of the most effective ever developed. Symptoms include high fever, cough, runny nose, watery eyes, white spots inside the mouth, and a red rash that spreads from the face to the body, appearing 7 to 14 days after exposure. The CDC emphasizes that measles is not merely a mild rash and fever but a serious disease. Anyone not protected by vaccination is at risk.

By February 11, 2026, over 800 additional cases had been confirmed in 23 states within just one and a half months, according to the Center for Outbreak Response Innovation. South Carolina experienced the most severe outbreak with at least 605 confirmed cases, while Texas, which had the highest burden in 2025, already reported two cases in early 2026. The rising case numbers threaten to jeopardize the U.S.'s measles elimination status, as reported by U.S. News and World Report.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2026 10:40 PM\nSource:[The New Republic](https://newrepublic.com/post/206496/robert-f-kennedy-jr-anti-vaccine-measles-mexico)\n\n**Mexico on the Brink: Measles Outbreak Approaches 8,500 Cases and Threatens National Health Status**\nM\u00e9xico is facing its most severe measles outbreak in decades, with 8,459 confirmed cases since February 2025 and 27 deaths reported, according to consolidated data from February 2026. The outbreak has prompted the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) to issue a clear warning: if transmission is not interrupted in the coming weeks, Mexico risks losing its official status as a measles-free country. The situation is national but uneven, with Jalisco reporting 1,245 cases in 2026\u2014nearly 60% of the year\u2019s total\u2014while Chihuahua leads the cumulative count with over 4,400 cases since the outbreak began. The most vulnerable group is children aged one to four, who are both at high risk and serve as key vectors for spreading the virus to adults. Experts emphasize that herd immunity requires at least 95% vaccination coverage, but low and uneven vaccination rates across regions\u2014despite over 11.8 million doses administered\u2014have left populations susceptible. In response, states like Jalisco and Nuevo Le\u00f3n are considering reintroducing mask-wearing in crowded indoor spaces as a temporary barrier. PAHO has set a deadline of April 2026 to assess whether measles transmission has become endemic (continuous for 12 months), which would mark a major public health setback. Currently, Mexico accounts for 71% of all measles cases in the Americas, raising regional concerns. The upcoming PAHO meeting in April will determine whether Mexico loses its measles-free status\u2014a designation with significant implications for public health surveillance, tourism, and international credibility. The crisis is not isolated: the U.S. CDC has reported a sharp rise in cases, and Spain saw a jump from 14 cases in 2023 to 229 in 2024, with projections nearing 400 in 2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 04:08 PM\nSource:[Xataka](https://www.xataka.com/medicina-y-salud/mexico-cuerda-floja-brote-sarampion-roza-8-500-casos-pone-jaque-estatus-sanitario-pais)\n\n**Map shows where measles is spreading fastest in 2026**\nThe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) reported 416 new measles cases in 14 states since the start of 2026, with nearly all linked to outbreaks that began in 2025. In 2025, the CDC confirmed 2,255 measles cases across 44 states\u2014the highest number since 1991\u2014and nearly 50 separate outbreaks. The largest ongoing outbreak is in Spartanburg County, South Carolina, which has become the worst in the U.S. New cases have also emerged in states bordering South Carolina and several western states. Measles, one of the most contagious viruses, spreads easily through respiratory droplets and can 'spread like a forest fire' in areas with low vaccination rates. The U.S. officially declared measles eliminated in 2000, but the 2025 outbreak\u2014originating in West Texas\u2014has led health experts to warn the country may lose that status. International health authorities plan to meet in April to assess the situation. Measles can be prevented with vaccination, requiring a 95% community immunity threshold; however, the national vaccination rate is currently 92.5%, with many communities falling significantly below that level.

This marks a significant increase from the previous year, when the U.S. recorded 2,255 cases\u2014a 34-year high and over 600% higher than the prior year. The country is approaching a critical deadline: in April, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) committee will assess whether measles has been continuously transmitted in the same chain for 12 months, a key criterion for determining if the U.S. has lost its measles elimination status. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) is coordinating with all 50 states to compile genomic sequencing data in preparation for the meeting.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 23, 2026 06:53 PM\nSource:[National Post](https://nationalpost.com/news/measles-cases-surging-across-the-u-s-spreading-to-five-more-states)\n\n**Measles Outbreak in the U.S. Worsens: South Carolina Reports Over 600 Cases Amid National Crisis**\nThe measles outbreak in the United States is intensifying, with South Carolina reporting over 600 confirmed cases as of January 20, 2026. Since the outbreak began last autumn, the state has recorded 646 cumulative infections, including cases in elementary schools, high schools, and two universities. Most infected individuals have not been vaccinated. The U.S. has reported over 2,200 cases in 2025, with three deaths, including two young children, and cases continue to rise in 2026. The U.S. is experiencing its worst measles outbreak in over 30 years, threatening its status as a country free of endemic measles since 2000. The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed additional cases in eight other states. U.S. Health Secretary Robert F. Kennedy Jr., known for his vaccine skepticism, has been accused of fueling vaccine fear and exacerbating the public health crisis. Mexico is also seeing a surge in cases, and the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) will reassess the measles situation in both the U.S. and Mexico in April. Canada reported over 5,000 cases in 2025 and lost its measles-free status in November 2025 after 27 years. Measles causes fever, respiratory symptoms, and rash, and can lead to severe complications such as pneumonia and encephalitis, resulting in long-term disability or death.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 21, 2026 01:49 AM\nSource:[Central News Agency](https://www.cna.com.tw/news/aopl/202601210038.aspx)\n\n**Why the US measles review matters as experts warn of wider risk**\nThe United States is under review by international health authorities for potentially losing its measles elimination status, following a significant outbreak that began in West Texas in January 2025. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) confirmed 2,144 measles cases across 44 states in 2025\u2014the highest number since 1991\u2014and nearly 50 separate outbreaks. The outbreak originated in Gaines County, Texas, where 762 people were confirmed ill, two children died, and 182 additional cases in children went unconfirmed in March 2025, suggesting a possible undercount of 44%. The virus spread to Utah, Arizona, South Carolina, New Mexico, Kansas, Ohio, Montana, North Dakota, Wisconsin, and Mexico, with Mexico reporting 6,000 cases and 21 deaths since February 2025. Genetic sequencing has confirmed the same measles strain across these regions, including in Canada. According to the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), which will make the final decision at a meeting on April 13, 2026, a country loses elimination status if a single chain of measles transmission persists uninterrupted for 12 months. Despite the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services stating there is no evidence of such a chain, experts like Dr. Andrew Pavia and behavioral scientist Noel Brewer believe the case for continuous transmission is strong and predict the U.S. will lose its elimination status. Experts emphasize that the current national vaccination rate of 92.5% is below the 95% threshold needed for herd immunity, and that barriers such as parental vaccine waivers, health care access issues, disinformation, and defunded public health efforts have contributed to the crisis. Dr. Jonathan Temte noted the situation reflects a failure to prioritize a safe and effective vaccine. The CDC\u2019s data remains among the best globally, but reduced investment in public health has weakened contact tracing, which can cost tens of thousands of dollars per case. Experts warn that measles, one of the most contagious viruses (infecting 9 out of 10 unvaccinated people), has found fertile ground in schools, day cares, churches, hospitals, and detention centers. With over 800 cases reported across Utah, Arizona, and South Carolina since late summer 2025 and no end in sight, the future of measles in the U.S. remains uncertain. As Brewer stated, '2025 was the year of measles,' and the trajectory for 2026 is unknown.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 09:22 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/health/measles-elimination-status-outbreak-states-b2904274.html)\n\n**At Least 171 Measles Cases Confirmed in Nine U.S. States in Early 2026**\nAt least 171 confirmed cases of measles have been reported across nine U.S. states\u2014Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, and Virginia\u2014in the first weeks of 2026, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The outbreak primarily affects unvaccinated children and is spreading in regions where vaccination coverage has declined in recent years. This surge threatens the U.S. status as a country free from endemic transmission, a designation achieved in 2000. The largest sustained outbreak is in South Carolina, particularly in Spartanburg County, while Utah has reported over 200 cumulative infections since June 2025, with 147 cases in the southwestern region. The current situation represents the highest number of cases in over three decades, surpassing 100 cases in just two weeks. The CDC notes that 2025 saw the highest measles count in 33 years, with 2,242 cases reported across more than 40 states and at least 50 confirmed outbreaks. The 2026 surge is linked to a strain detected in Texas in 2025, as confirmed by public health officials, including David Heaton of the Southwest Utah Department of Public Health, who stated, 'our outbreak corresponds to the same strain detected in Texas in 2025, which demonstrates the connectivity of current hotspots.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 04:29 PM\nSource:[LaPatilla.com](https://lapatilla.com/2026/01/15/al-menos-171-casos-de-sarampion-confirmados-en-nueve-estados-de-eeuu-en-2026/)\n\n**Measles Outbreak in the U.S. Surges to 171 Cases in Nine States in Early 2026, Threatening Elimination Status**\nAt least 171 cases of measles have been confirmed across nine U.S. states\u2014Arizona, Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, South Carolina, Utah, and Virginia\u2014in the first weeks of 2026, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The outbreak, primarily affecting unvaccinated children, marks the highest number of cases in over three decades. The largest sustained outbreak is in South Carolina, particularly in Spartanburg County, while Utah has reported over 200 cumulative infections since June 2025, with 147 cases in the southwest region. The CDC notes that 90% of 2025 cases were linked to outbreaks, with 2,242 cases reported nationwide\u2014the highest in 33 years. In 2024, only 16 outbreaks were recorded, and in 2023, just four. The current 2026 trend already exceeds 100 cases in two weeks. The virus is linked to the same strain detected in Texas in 2025, as confirmed by David Heaton of the Southwest Utah Department of Public Health. The CDC reports that 95% of confirmed cases involved unvaccinated or undetermined individuals; only 2% had one dose of the MMR vaccine, and 2% had the full two-dose series. The majority of cases are in children under 19. The national MMR vaccination rate for kindergarten students dropped to 92.5% in the 2024\u20132025 school year, down from 92.7% the previous year and 95.2% pre-pandemic. The CDC warns that sustained transmission for 12 consecutive months could lead to the U.S. losing its 2000 WHO-recognized status of measles elimination. The agency emphasizes the need for two doses of the MMR vaccine\u2014first between 12\u201315 months and second between 4\u20136 years\u2014for 97% effectiveness. Health authorities have intensified surveillance, mandatory reporting, contact tracing, quarantine protocols, and vaccination campaigns in affected areas. The CDC stresses that measles is one of the most contagious viruses, capable of infecting 9 out of 10 susceptible individuals exposed. Experts warn that vaccination rates below 95% risk sustained outbreaks, even in high-resource countries. The current situation is being closely monitored, with federal and state cooperation deemed essential to prevent sustained transmission.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 01:14 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/estados-unidos/2026/01/15/al-menos-171-casos-de-sarampion-confirmados-en-nueve-estados-de-eeuu-en-las-primeras-semanas-del-ano/)\n\n**U.S. measles cases hit a 30-year high in 2025, CDC data shows - National | Globalnews.ca**\nThe United States recorded 2,144 confirmed measles cases in 2025, marking the highest number since 1992 and a 652% increase from the 285 cases reported in 2024.
