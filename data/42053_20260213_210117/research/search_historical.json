Here's what that means\"\n\n**Date:** January 31, 2026  \n**Author:** Maria Godoy\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **South Carolina Outbreak:**\n   - 847 confirmed cases since October (first case reported)\n   - 58 new cases reported on Friday (since Tuesday)\n   - Outbreak grew in just 16 weeks, faster than the Texas outbreak which took 7 months\n   - Vast majority of cases are in unvaccinated children and teens\n   - About two dozen schools under quarantine\n   - Cases also reported at Clemson University and Anderson University\n\n2. **Spread Beyond South Carolina:**\n   - North Carolina has confirmed several cases linked to the South Carolina outbreak\n   - Washington state (Snohomish County): 6 measles cases in unvaccinated children linked to a family visiting from South Carolina\n\n3. **U.S. Measles Elimination Status:**\n   - The U.S. clock for potential loss of elimination status started in January 2025 with the Texas outbreak\n   - Elimination status requires going a year without continuous chain of transmission\n   - PAHO (Pan American Health Organization) plans to review U.S. measles elimination status this spring\n   - The U.S. maintained elimination status for 25 years (since 2000)\n\n4. **Vaccination Rates:**\n   - Spartanburg County, S.C.: 90% schoolwide vaccination rate for required immunizations\n   - Nationwide: 92.5% of kindergartners received measles vaccine in 2024-2025 school year\n   - Ideal vaccination rate to prevent outbreaks: 95% or more\n\n5. **Measles Characteristics:**\n   - Two doses of MMR vaccine are 97% effective at providing lifelong immunity\n   - One infected person can sicken up to 18 other unvaccinated people on average\n   - Contagious from 4 days before rash appears until 4 days after\n   - Infectious particles can linger in air for up to 2 hours\n\n6. **Economic Impact:**\n   - Average cost per measles case: $43,000\n   - Outbreaks of 50+ cases can cost well over $1 million total\n\n## Named Expert Opinions:\n\n- **Dr. Linda Bell (South Carolina state epidemiologist):** Expressed concern about the rapid trajectory of the outbreak and uncertainty about the final case count\n\n- **Dr. Demetre Daskalakis (infectious disease specialist, former CDC official):** \"We do not have the capability to actually control measles... So I'm going to say that elimination is already lost.\" He attributes the resurgence to misinformation undermining vaccine trust.\n\n- **Dr. Ralph Abraham (CDC principal deputy director):** When asked if losing elimination status was significant, said \"Not really.\" Stated it wouldn't impact how the administration tackles measles. Emphasized \"religious freedom, health freedom, personal freedom\" and respecting communities that \"choose to go a somewhat of a different route.\"\n\n- **Caitlin Rivers (epidemiologist, Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health):** Views potential loss of elimination status as \"really a comment on the state of the public health system\" and evidence of \"the cycle of panic and neglect.\"\n\n- **Dr. William Moss (International Vaccine Access Center, Johns Hopkins):** Warned that rising cases will lead to more hospitalizations, deaths, and greater toll on the public health system. Also noted that fighting measles diverts resources from other public health priorities.\n\n- **Dr. Anna-Kathryn Burch (pediatric infectious disease specialist, Prisma Health, Columbia, S.C.):** Expressed heartbreak over the outbreak and predicted numbers will continue to grow over the next several months.\n\n## Context:\n\n- The article notes the Trump administration has \"taken multiple steps to undermine overall confidence in vaccines\"\n- Experts attribute outbreaks to communities choosing not to vaccinate\n- Measles was declared eliminated from the U.S. in 2000 by PAHO, but the virus is still endemic in many parts of the world with cases brought in from abroad annually\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide CDC-reported U.S. measles case totals for each year 2010-2025. Also list the 2026 cumulative total as of 13 Feb 2026 and summarize major outbreaks contributing to 2024-2026 figures.\nBelow is a consolidated year-by-year list of confirmed U.S. measles cases reported by CDC (or CDC-derived tables) together with the most recent 2026 cumulative figure and a narrative of the principal outbreaks that produced the high totals in 2024-2026.\n\nA. CDC-reported U.S. measles case totals, 2010-2026  \n(Totals for 2010-2023 come from CDC yearly summaries that are reproduced in the Statista \u201cNew cases of measles in the U.S. 1985-2026\u201d data set; 2024-2026 come directly from the current CDC Measles Cases and Outbreaks page.)\n\nYear | Confirmed cases\n---- | ---------------\n2010 | 63 (Statista, citing CDC)  \n2011 | 220 (Statista, citing CDC)  \n2012 | 55 (Statista, citing CDC)  \n2013 | 187 (Statista, citing CDC)  \n2014 | 667 (Statista, citing CDC)  \n2015 | 188 (Statista, citing CDC)  \n2016 | 86 (Statista, citing CDC)  \n2017 | 120 (Statista, citing CDC)  \n2018 | 372 (Statista, citing CDC)  \n2019 | 1,274 (ASM article quoting CDC & Statista)  \n2020 | 13 (Statista, citing CDC)  \n2021 | 49 (Statista, citing CDC)  \n2022 | 121 (Statista, citing CDC)  \n2023 | 59 (CDC page \u2013 4 outbreaks, 59 cases)  \n2024 | 285 (CDC page, updated 31 Dec 2024)  \n2025 | 2,280 (CDC page, full-year total)  \n2026 | 910 (as of 12 Feb 2026, CDC page)\n\nThus, between 2010 and 2023 the annual case count exceeded 1,000 only once (2019). The jump to 2,280 cases in 2025 represents the highest single-year total since 1992 and dwarfs every year since elimination was declared in 2000.\n\nB. 2026 cumulative total as of 13 Feb 2026  \nThe CDC \u201cMeasles Cases and Outbreaks\u201d update dated 13 Feb 2026 shows 910 confirmed U.S. cases reported in 2026 to date (CDC page, accessed 13 Feb 2026).\n\nC. Major outbreaks that drove the 2024-2026 numbers\n\n1. Calendar year 2024 (285 cases; 16 outbreaks)  \n\u2022 Size/character: 69 % of cases (198) were outbreak-associated (CDC page).  \n\u2022 Philadelphia children\u2019s-hospital cluster (January 2024) \u2013 sparked by an unvaccinated child returning from overseas; the infection spread in a day-care centre before quarantine was in place (ASM article).  \n\u2022 Additional small multi-state clusters occurred, but all remained under 50 cases each; no single state exceeded 60 cases.  \n\u2022 Outcome: although higher than 2023, the total remained far below 2019 and elimination status was maintained.\n\n2. Calendar year 2025 (2,280 cases; 49 outbreaks) \u2013 the breakout year  \n\u2022 West Texas megacluster (February\u2013August 2025): more than 760 confirmed infections and two pediatric deaths; accounted for one-third of the national total (CBS News, 5 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 South Carolina outbreak (October\u2013December 2025): >200 confirmed cases, hundreds of student quarantines (Reuters summary in Contagion Live, 13 Feb 2026; ABC News, 23 Dec 2025).  \n\u2022 Utah-Arizona border outbreak (autumn 2025): multistate chain tied to declining vaccination in polygamous communities; dozens of linked exposure sites (Contagion Live).  \n\u2022 Numerous smaller outbreaks (\u22653 related cases) in 45 jurisdictions; 89 % of all 2025 cases were tied to outbreaks (CDC page).  \n\u2022 Vaccination status: 92-93 % of 2025 patients were unvaccinated or had unknown status (Contagion Live; CDC).  \n\u2022 Public-health impact: three U.S. deaths; first time regional elimination status for the Americas was judged lost by PAHO (ASTHO blog, 21 Jan 2026).\n\n3. Calendar year 2026 to date (910 cases through 12 Feb; 5 new 2026 outbreaks, plus spill-over from 2025 chains)  \n\u2022 Continuing South Carolina transmission: outbreak that began in Oct 2025 grew to 847 confirmed infections by late January 2026 and remains the epicentre (ABC News, 31 Jan 2026; NBC News tracker). Roughly 90 % of 2026 national cases are outbreak-associated, and 760 of those cases belong to outbreaks that technically started in 2025 (CDC page).  \n\u2022 Maine (February 2026): first state case since 2019 \u2013 travel-related adult; illustrates geographic spread beyond the Southeast (Maine DHHS, 6 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 Other active jurisdictions include Utah, Arizona, Kentucky, and Minnesota, each reporting school or community exposure events (CDC list of 24 jurisdictions; Contagion Live).  \n\u2022 Vaccination status remains similar: about 90 % of 2026 cases are in unvaccinated/unknown-status persons (CDC).\n\nD. How these data inform the forecasting question (\u22652,000 U.S. cases by 24 Apr 2026?)\n\nCurrent pace: 910 confirmed cases have accrued in the first 43 calendar days of 2026 (through 12 Feb). 2025 reached ~900 cases only in late May of that year; the 2026 curve is therefore \u22482\u00bd months ahead of last year\u2019s record trajectory. If the current weekly average (~150\u2013175 cases/week since early January, per NBC News weekly tracker) persists or accelerates as winter/spring transmission continues, the cumulative total could exceed 2,000 before mid-April.\n\nHowever, two uncertainties could slow growth:\n\u2022 Containment of the South Carolina outbreak \u2013 if effective quarantine and catch-up vaccination halt spread, the largest contributing chain could plateau.  \n\u2022 Possible saturation of susceptible individuals in key under-vaccinated pockets after intense transmission last year.\n\nConversely, spring break and Easter travel, plus evidence of ongoing household and community exposures in Utah and the Southeast, create upside risk.\n\nE. Remaining information gaps and suggested next searches\n\n1. Source confirmation for the 2010-2022 annual figures. They are widely quoted, but a direct citation from archived CDC web pages or MMWR annual summaries would strengthen provenance beyond the Statista secondary compilation.\n\n2. Up-to-the-minute 2026 figures. The CDC page is updated weekly (Thursday). Close to the 24 Apr deadline, forecasters will need the exact CDC count posted for that day.\n\n3. Detailed epidemic curves for South Carolina, Texas 2025, and Utah/Arizona to allow modelling of prospective incident cases.\n\nGiven those gaps, one additional round of searching could target:\n\u2022 Google: CDC measles annual cases archive 2010 site:cdc.gov  \n\u2022 Google News: South Carolina measles outbreak February 2026 update  \n\u2022 Google: MMWR measles United States 2012 update  \n\u2022 Google: Utah measles wastewater February 2026  \n(No further queries are executed here; listed only for completeness.)\n\nIn summary, CDC-reported measles cases were relatively modest from 2010-2023, surged to 285 in 2024, exploded to 2,280 in 2025 due chiefly to West Texas and South Carolina outbreaks, and have already reached 910 by 13 Feb 2026 with South Carolina still driving transmission. Unless containment sharply improves, the country is on pace to surpass 2,000 cases well before 24 Apr 2026.</Agent_report>\n"
