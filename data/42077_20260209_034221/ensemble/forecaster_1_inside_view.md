Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**BBC article (Feb 8, 2026) - Gorton and Denton by-election:**
High-quality source documenting campaign activity. Factual: by-election on Feb 26, 2026; Matt Goodwin is Reform candidate. No direct information on MP count but confirms Reform's active campaigning.

**Brookings article (Dec 17, 2025):**
Reputable think tank analysis. Factual: Reform topped polls for over a year; Greens now polling ~15%. Opinion from institutional source: describes UK politics as "highly volatile and fragmented." Provides context but predates recent defections.

**Guardian article (Feb 4, 2026) - Electoral reform:**
Quality journalism by George Monbiot. Factual: 2024 election results (Reform 14.3% vote, 5 seats); analysis suggesting Reform could win 48% of seats on 27% vote. Opinion (columnist): warns of Reform's potential path to power through FPTP system. Relevant for understanding Reform's strategic position but not directly about MP count.

**Guardian article (Jan 18, 2026) - Jenrick defection:**
Quality journalism by John Harris. Factual: Jenrick defected Jan 18; Farage set May 7 deadline for defections. Opinion (columnist): argues Reform and Conservatives share same worldview, predicting possible "reunion." Critical quote from Farage: Reform "not a rescue charity for every panicky Tory MP."

**BBC article (Jan 18, 2026) - Farage statement:**
High-quality source. Factual: "Around 20 former Conservative MPs" joined Reform; May 7 cutoff confirmed; Jenrick brings ministerial experience. Direct quotes from Farage establishing strict conditions for defectors. States "well-known Labour figure" would defect next week.

**BBC article (Jan 26, 2026) - Braverman defection:**
High-quality source. Factual: Braverman defected Jan 26, bringing total to 8 MPs; third sitting Tory MP in 11 days; "around 20 former Tory MPs" joined since general election. Direct quote from Farage: had been talking to Braverman for "just over a year." Conservative spokesman: "always a matter of when, not if" she would defect.

**AskNews articles (Feb 8-9, 2026):**
- **Reform shadow cabinet announcement (Feb 8):** Factual: Farage announcing shadow cabinet plans; Reform has "only seven sitting MPs" (contradicts question background of 8 - likely timing issue or error). Jenrick expected as shadow chancellor.
- **Nigel Farage PM campaign (Feb 8):** Factual: Farage launching PM campaign; Reform has 8 MPs including 4 former Tories; candidate selection starts after May 7.
- **Morgan McSweeney resignation (Feb 8):** Factual: Starmer's chief of staff resigned over Mandelson appointment. Relevant for understanding Labour's crisis creating opportunity for Reform.
- **Gorton and Denton analysis (Jan 30):** Academic source from University of Manchester. Factual: Reform now has 8 MPs; byelection Feb 26. Expert opinion: Reform could benefit from split left-wing vote.
- **Local elections postponement (Jan 22):** Factual: 30 local elections cancelled/postponed; Farage launching judicial review. Relevant for understanding Reform's May 7 strategy.

**Key discrepancy:** Some sources say 7 MPs, others 8. Question background states 8 as of late January 2026, which aligns with Braverman defection (Jan 26) being the most recent.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- **May 7 deadline is firm** (BBC, multiple sources): Farage explicitly stated no defections after May 7. This is a hard constraint. Multiple independent confirmations.
- **Current count is 8 MPs** (question background, BBC Jan 26, multiple AskNews): Confirmed by multiple sources post-Braverman defection.
- **Strict defection criteria** (BBC Jan 18, Guardian Jan 18): Farage's direct quotes establishing high bar for defectors. This limits potential defections.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **January surge pattern** (BBC, Guardian): 3 sitting MPs defected in 11 days (Jan 16-26). Demonstrates clustering behavior but occurred before prediction window.
- **"Around 20 former Conservative MPs" joined** (BBC Jan 18, Jan 26): These are former MPs, not sitting MPs, so don't count toward resolution but indicate Reform's appeal.
- **Identified potential defectors** (Guardian Jan 15): Brandon Lewis, Katie Lam, Nick Timothy, Mark Francois, others mentioned. However, Nick Timothy accepted shadow role, reducing likelihood.
- **Labour crisis** (AskNews Feb 8): McSweeney resignation, Mandelson scandal. Creates political opportunity but doesn't directly cause Conservative defections.
- **Negative sentiment from Reform supporters** (Queen Mary analysis): 17% view defections negatively. Moderate constraint on further defections.

**Weak evidence:**
- **Polling plateau** (GB News, Brookings): Reform may have "hit ceiling" but polling doesn't directly predict defections.
- **By-election on Feb 26** (multiple sources): Could create momentum but unlikely to produce new MPs before May 7 (by-elections take time to trigger and hold).
- **"Well-known Labour figure" defection** (BBC Jan 18): Mentioned for "next week" after Jan 18. If this was Baroness Hoey, she's in Lords, not Commons, so wouldn't count.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 88 days (Feb 9 to May 7, 2026) - approximately 3 months.

**If halved to 44 days (mid-March):** Would expect fewer defections as deadline pressure less acute. Conservative MPs might wait to see May local election results before deciding. Prediction would shift down by 1-2 MPs.

**If doubled to 176 days (early August):** Additional time would allow for more defections and potential by-election wins. However, Farage's stated May 7 cutoff suggests strategic reasons for deadline (local elections, candidate selection). Without this deadline, prediction would shift up by 2-4 MPs as more fence-sitters could be persuaded.

**Key temporal factors:**
- January saw explosive 3-MP defection period, but this was 2+ weeks before prediction window starts
- 88 days provides sufficient time for 2-5 more defections given historical patterns
- Deadline urgency increases as May 7 approaches, potentially triggering late wave
- But Farage's strict criteria and negative Reform supporter sentiment create counterpressure

## (d) Justification

**Starting point:** 8 MPs (confirmed by question background and multiple sources as of late Jan 2026).

**Factors supporting additional defections (moderate-strong evidence):**
1. **May 7 deadline creates urgency:** Farage explicitly stated defectors after this date have "little value." This creates now-or-never pressure for Conservative MPs considering switch.
2. **Identified potential defectors:** Brandon Lewis described as "obvious next defector" (Guardian); Mark Francois, Sir John Hayes, Esther McVey praised Farage in January.
3. **January clustering pattern:** 3 MPs defected in 11 days, suggesting when one goes, others follow quickly.
4. **Conservative Party crisis:** Kemi Badenoch's leadership struggling; party described as "out of touch" by defectors.
5. **Labour government unpopularity:** Creates political opportunity for opposition party to attract defectors.

**Factors limiting additional defections (moderate-strong evidence):**
1. **Farage's strict conditions:** Must publicly admit Conservatives "broke the country" - high reputational cost.
2. **Negative Reform supporter reaction:** 17% view defections negatively; risk of appearing as "Tory 2.0."
3. **Most motivated defectors already jumped:** January surge likely captured those most eager to switch.
4. **Nick Timothy accepted shadow justice role:** Reduces one identified potential defector.
5. **Career risk:** Defecting MPs face uncertain electoral prospects; Reform's 5 original MPs won in specific circumstances.

**Distribution shift from outside view:**

Outside view suggested 10th percentile: 8, median: 10-11, 90th percentile: 15.

**Adjustments based on inside view:**
- **Lower bound (10th percentile):** Should remain at 8 (status quo). Possible no further defections if Farage's strict criteria and brand concerns dominate. Strong evidence for this floor.
- **Median (50th-60th percentile):** Shift slightly up from outside view's 10-11 to 10-12. The May 7 deadline is firm (strong evidence) and creates urgency. Identified potential defectors (moderate evidence) suggest 2-4 more likely. January clustering pattern (moderate evidence) supports this.
- **Upper bound (90th percentile):** Reduce from outside view's 15 to 13-14. Farage's strict criteria (strong evidence) and negative supporter sentiment (moderate evidence) limit upside. The January surge likely captured the low-hanging fruit. Exceeding 13-14 would require a second major wave, which seems unlikely given stated selectivity.

**Key insight:** The May 7 deadline is a hard constraint with strong evidence. The question is how many of the identified potential defectors will actually jump. Given Farage's strict criteria and the January surge already capturing motivated defectors, expect modest additional growth rather than explosive wave.

## Distribution Calibration

**Status quo:** 8 MPs (current count)

**If current trend continued:** The January trend showed 3 defections in 11 days. If this rate continued for 88 days, we'd expect ~24 additional defections, bringing total to 32 MPs. This is clearly unrealistic given Farage's stated selectivity, limited pool of potential defectors, and negative sentiment from existing supporters.

**More realistic trend:** The September 2025 - January 2026 period showed 5 defections over 4 months (~1.25/month). Applying this to 3 months suggests 3-4 additional defections, bringing total to 11-12 MPs. This aligns better with evidence.

**Calibration considerations:**
- **Lower tail (10th-20th percentile):** Should capture scenario where defection momentum stalls completely or only 1 more MP switches. Given identified potential defectors and deadline urgency, completely stalling seems unlikely but possible. Set 10th at 8 (status quo), 20th at 9.
- **Middle range (40th-60th percentile):** Most likely outcome is 2-4 additional defections from identified potential switchers (Brandon Lewis, possibly 1-2 others from Francois/Hayes/McVey group). Set 40th at 10, 60th at 11.
- **Upper tail (80th-90th percentile):** Optimistic scenario with 5-6 more defections would require either a second clustering wave or most identified potential defectors switching. Given Farage's selectivity and brand concerns, this seems less likely but possible if Conservative crisis deepens. Set 80th at 12, 90th at 14.

**Testing ±10% shifts:**
- If 60th percentile shifted from 11 to 10 (down): Would suggest even more conservative view that only 2 additional defections likely. Seems too pessimistic given identified potential defectors and deadline urgency.
- If 60th percentile shifted from 11 to 12 (up): Would suggest 4 additional defections as median outcome. Possible but seems slightly optimistic given Farage's strict criteria.
- If 90th percentile shifted from 14 to 15-16: Would suggest possibility of 7-8 more defections. Seems too optimistic given evidence of brand concerns and limited remaining pool.
- If 10th percentile shifted from 8 to 9: Would eliminate possibility of zero additional defections. Given uncertainty and Farage's strict criteria, maintaining 8 as floor seems prudent.

**Final calibration:** The distribution should be slightly right-skewed (more upside than downside from status quo) given deadline urgency and identified potential defectors, but bounded by Farage's selectivity. Median around 10-11 MPs (2-3 additional defections) seems most consistent with evidence.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** Number of Reform UK MPs in House of Commons on May 7, 2026. Currently 8 MPs. Resolution in 88 days.

2. **Outside view base rate:** 10th: 8, median: 10-11, 90th: 15. My final prediction maintains similar floor (8) but reduces upper tail (14 vs 15) due to strong evidence of Farage's selectivity and brand concerns.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 10.5; mean ≈ 10.8. This suggests 2-3 additional defections from current 8, which aligns with identified potential defectors (Brandon Lewis, possibly 1-2 from Francois/Hayes/McVey group) and Farage's strict criteria limiting larger waves.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence:**
   - May 7 deadline is firm and creates urgency (strong evidence, multiple sources)
   - Farage's strict defection criteria limit pool (strong evidence, direct quotes)
   - 2-3 identified potential defectors remain (moderate evidence, Guardian reporting)
   - January surge captured most motivated switchers (moderate evidence, timing analysis)
   - Negative sentiment from 17% of Reform supporters constrains upside (moderate evidence, academic source)

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** A major Conservative Party crisis (e.g., Badenoch resignation, major scandal) in March-April could trigger a second defection wave of 5-8 MPs, making my 90th percentile (14) look too conservative. This would push outcome UP significantly. Alternatively, if Reform performs poorly in early local elections or a major Reform scandal emerges, defection momentum could completely stall, making even my 10th percentile (8) look optimistic and pushing outcome DOWN.

6. **Status quo outcome:** Current count is 8 MPs. Given 88-day timeframe and identified potential defectors, complete stasis seems unlikely. However, the world changes slowly - most Conservative MPs will choose to stay with their party despite its struggles. My distribution appropriately weights status quo (8) as 10th percentile while allowing for modest growth.

7. **Technicalities:** Values are strictly increasing (8 < 9 < 10 < 11 < 12 < 14), units are MPs as requested, all values fall within stated bounds (-0.5 to 30.5+).
