Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles (from Outside View):**
1. **BBC (8 Feb 2026)** - High quality. Reports Gorton & Denton by-election on 26 Feb with Reform candidate Matt Goodwin. Factual on electoral law violation investigation. No direct MP count information.

2. **Brookings (17 Dec 2025)** - Credible think tank. Provides polling context (Reform topped polls for >1 year, Starmer's low approval). Opinion-heavy on political volatility; factual on historical trends.

3. **Guardian Monbiot (4 Feb 2026)** - Quality outlet, opinion columnist. Factual: 2024 election gave Reform 5 seats on 14.3% vote. Analysis of electoral system is expert opinion but speculative on future outcomes.

4. **Guardian Harris (18 Jan 2026)** - Quality outlet. Confirms Farage's 7 May deadline and "no more defections after" statement. Factual on Jenrick defection timing. Opinion on ideological convergence.

5. **BBC (18 Jan 2026)** - High quality. Confirms "around 20 former Conservative MPs" joined Reform, 7 May cutoff, Jenrick's ministerial experience. Quotes from Farage, Tice, Nandy are factual. "Well-known Labour figure" claim is unverified rumor.

6. **BBC (26 Jan 2026)** - High quality. Confirms Braverman defection brings total to 8 MPs. Lists 4 sitting MPs defected (including Jenrick, Rosindell, Braverman) plus ~20 former MPs. Factual timeline and quotes.

**AskNews Articles:**
1. **AOL (8 Feb 2026)** - Reports shadow cabinet announcement for 9 Feb. Jenrick likely shadow chancellor. Notes Reform has "seven sitting MPs" (appears outdated vs BBC's 8). Moderate quality.

2. **The Age (8 Feb 2026)** - Quality outlet. Reports McSweeney resignation over Mandelson appointment. Relevant for Labour instability context but no direct Reform MP information.

3. **Metro (7 Feb 2026)** - Reports Goodwin's controversial tax proposal. Moderate quality; relevant for by-election context only.

4. **Mirror (7 Feb 2026)** - Labour candidate Stogia's comments on by-election. Low direct relevance to MP count.

5. **WalesOnline (7 Feb 2026)** - Reports Reform's first Anglesey council seat, Dan Thomas as Welsh leader, two former Tory MSs joined. Factual but about Senedd, not Westminster MPs.

6. **Multiple sources on local elections postponement** - EXPRESS, taz.de, ITV (Dec 2025-Jan 2026). Factual: up to 63 councils may delay May 2026 elections. Relevant for political context but doesn't affect Westminster MP count directly.

7. **Breitbart (14 Jan 2026)** - Reports 1M+ petition for general election. Lower quality source; relevant for political instability context.

8. **Yahoo/Reform London rally (12 Jan 2026)** - Reports Tice predicting council wins in London. Moderate quality; shows Reform ambition but no MP count data.

**Key Factual Consensus:**
- Current count: 8 MPs (BBC 26 Jan 2026 - most recent, authoritative)
- Deadline: 7 May 2026 confirmed by multiple sources (Farage statement)
- Pool: ~20 former Tory MPs already joined; "around 20" more potentially sympathetic
- Recent defections: Jenrick (16 Jan), Rosindell (18 Jan), Braverman (26 Jan)
- Time remaining: 88 days (9 Feb to 7 May)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **8 MPs confirmed as of 26 Jan 2026** (BBC, multiple independent sources) - establishes baseline
- **7 May 2026 hard deadline** (Farage public statement, BBC, Guardian) - creates urgency but also cutoff
- **3 defections in 11 days (16-26 Jan)** - demonstrates recent acceleration

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **"Around 20" former MPs already joined** (BBC) - shows large pool already depleted
- **Farage's "not a rescue charity" rhetoric** (BBC, Guardian) - suggests selectivity, may slow defections
- **Political instability (McSweeney resignation, Mandelson scandal)** - creates environment for defections but indirect
- **Gorton & Denton by-election 26 Feb** - if Reform wins, could trigger more defections; if loses, could deter

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Polling showing Reform leading** (Brookings, multiple) - doesn't directly predict defections
- **Local election postponements** - removes some political pressure but unclear impact on MPs
- **Shadow cabinet formation 9 Feb** - may attract defectors with promise of roles, but speculative

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**88 days remaining (9 Feb to 7 May 2026)**

The 7 May deadline creates a hard cutoff. Historical pattern shows:
- July 2024 to mid-Jan 2026 (~6 months): 5→8 MPs = 3 defections
- 16-26 Jan 2026 (11 days): 3 defections (acceleration)

**If timeframe halved (44 days):** Would expect 1-2 additional defections maximum, as the deadline pressure would be less intense.

**If timeframe doubled (176 days):** Without the hard deadline, might see 4-6 more defections as MPs wait to see polling trends, but the 7 May cutoff eliminates this scenario.

The deadline creates a "now or never" dynamic. MPs considering defection must decide within 88 days or lose the opportunity. This could accelerate decisions but also means the pool is finite and shrinking.

## (d) Justification for Inside View Adjustment

**Factors shifting prediction UPWARD from outside view:**

1. **Recent acceleration** (Strong): 3 defections in 11 days vs. 3 in prior 6 months suggests momentum. If this rate continued, we'd see ~24 more defections by 7 May (clearly unsustainable, but indicates increased willingness).

2. **Deadline pressure** (Moderate): The 7 May cutoff creates urgency. MPs who might have waited are forced to decide now. Historical precedent: Brexit Party saw clustering of defections before key dates.

3. **High-profile defectors** (Moderate): Braverman and Jenrick are former cabinet ministers. Their moves may legitimize defection for others and provide "cover" for more junior MPs.

**Factors shifting prediction DOWNWARD from outside view:**

1. **Pool depletion** (Strong): If ~20 former MPs already joined and only ~20-25 sitting MPs are considered sympathetic, the remaining pool is small (perhaps 5-10 realistic candidates).

2. **Farage's selectivity** (Moderate): "Not a rescue charity" rhetoric suggests vetting. Not all who want to defect will be accepted.

3. **Electoral risk** (Moderate): MPs defecting lose incumbency advantage and face uncertain re-selection. The Gorton & Denton by-election (26 Feb) is a test case - if Reform loses badly, it may deter further defections.

4. **Diminishing returns** (Weak): Media attention on defections is declining. Later defectors get less publicity benefit.

**Net Assessment:**
The recent acceleration (3 in 11 days) is striking but likely unsustainable - it probably represents a one-time cluster of MPs who were already decided. The hard deadline and high-profile defectors support 2-4 more defections. However, pool depletion and selectivity constrain the upside. 

The outside view suggested 8-11 as central (0-3 more defections). Current evidence supports the upper end of this range or slightly higher. The acceleration suggests 2-4 more is more likely than 0-1, but >6 more (reaching 14+) would require nearly all remaining sympathetic MPs to defect, which seems unlikely given Farage's selectivity and electoral risks.

## Distribution Calibration

**Current baseline: 8 MPs**

**Downside scenarios (7 or below):**
- One MP dies, resigns for health/scandal, or is disqualified before 7 May
- Probability: ~5-8% for a single loss over 88 days
- Two losses would be highly unusual: <2%
- **10th percentile: 8** (status quo, no net change)

**Central scenarios (9-11):**
- 1-3 additional defections is most likely
- The 11-day acceleration suggests at least 1-2 more are imminent
- Pool of ~5-10 realistic remaining candidates
- Farage's selectivity means not all will be accepted
- **20th-60th percentiles: 9-11**

**Upside scenarios (12-14):**
- 4-6 additional defections would require:
  - Gorton & Denton by-election win (26 Feb) creating momentum
  - Multiple MPs defecting as a coordinated group
  - Farage relaxing selectivity criteria
- Plausible but requires multiple favorable conditions
- **80th percentile: 13**

**Extreme upside (15+):**
- Would require 7+ additional defections
- Nearly impossible given pool size and Farage's stated selectivity
- Would need a major political shock (e.g., Starmer resignation triggering early election)
- **90th percentile: 15**

**Extreme downside (7 or below):**
- Requires net losses (deaths/resignations exceeding defections)
- Very unlikely over 88 days
- **10th percentile: 8** (already at floor given base rate of defections)

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** Number of Reform UK MPs in House of Commons on 7 May 2026 (88 days from now).

2. **Outside view base rate:** 10th: 7, 20th: 8, 40th: 9, 60th: 11, 80th: 13, 90th: 15. My prediction is anchored to this with slight upward shift due to recent acceleration.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median ≈10, mean ≈10.5. This suggests 2 additional defections from current 8, consistent with recent momentum but acknowledging pool constraints.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - 8 MPs confirmed as of 26 Jan (BBC - factual, high quality)
   - 3 defections in 11 days mid-Jan showing acceleration (BBC - factual)
   - 7 May hard deadline creating urgency (Farage statement - factual)
   - Pool of ~5-10 realistic remaining candidates (inferred from "around 20" already joined)
   - Farage's selectivity rhetoric may constrain acceptances (BBC quote - factual)

5. **Blind-spot:** A major political shock (e.g., Starmer forced to call snap election before May, or Reform wins Gorton & Denton decisively) could trigger a cascade of 5-8 more defections, pushing outcome to 13-16. This would make my forecast look too conservative (outcome HIGHER).

6. **Status quo:** Current 8 MPs. Given 88-day timeframe and recent acceleration, expecting zero additional defections seems too conservative. However, volatility is high - a single by-election result could shift momentum significantly. Slight upward nudge from status quo is warranted.

7. **Technicalities:** Values strictly increasing, units are "MPs" (whole numbers), range 8-15 is within bounds (-0.5 to 30.5).
