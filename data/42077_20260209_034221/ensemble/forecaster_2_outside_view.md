Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Queen Mary University article (Feb 6, 2026):**
Academic analysis by Matthew Barnfield examining polling data on Reform UK defections. High-quality source with specific YouGov polling data. Key facts: 17% of Reform supporters became more negative about defections (highest of any party), while ~20% of Conservative voters became more favorable. The article provides expert opinion on strategic implications but is primarily analytical rather than predictive of specific MP counts.

**AOL article (Jan 19, 2026):**
News report on Jenrick/Rosindell defections. States Reform had 7 MPs as of Jan 19, 2026 (before Braverman's defection). Confirms May elections as implicit deadline. Factual reporting of events and statements, though quotes from Farage about "replacing Conservatives" are political rhetoric rather than expert analysis.

**Guardian article (Jan 15, 2026):**
Comprehensive overview by Kiran Stacey listing 18 current or former parliamentarians who joined Reform. Critical fact: Farage's explicit deadline of May elections for accepting defectors. Lists potential future defectors including Braverman (who did defect Jan 26), Brandon Lewis, and others. High-quality journalism distinguishing between sitting MPs and former MPs.

**GB News article (Jan 20, 2026):**
Focuses on Scottish polling showing Reform dropped 3 points in constituency voting. Contains expert opinions from James Crouch (Opinium) stating Reform "appears to have hit its ceiling across the UK." Relevant for understanding momentum but doesn't directly address Westminster MP defections.

**BBC article (Jan 18, 2026):**
Reports ~20 former Conservative MPs joined Reform, with Farage's May 7 cutoff explicitly confirmed. States a "well-known Labour figure" would defect "next week" (likely late January 2026). High-quality source confirming the deadline and Farage's conditions for defectors.

**Agent report:**
Comprehensive historical list of UKIP/Brexit Party/Reform defections since 2010. Documents 5 sitting Conservative MPs who defected to Reform (Anderson, Kruger, Jenrick, Rosindell, Braverman) plus numerous former MPs. Lists several Conservative MPs who made positive statements about Farage in January 2026, including Sir John Hayes, Mark Francois, and Esther McVey. Well-sourced with specific dates and citations.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Historical UKIP/Brexit Party defections (2014-2019)**
Only 2 Conservative MPs defected to UKIP (Carswell, Reckless) over several years. No sitting Conservative MPs defected to Brexit Party in 2019. This suggests defections are rare events.
*Suitability: Moderate* - different political contexts, but shows baseline rarity of defections.

**Reference Class 2: Reform UK defections 2024-2026**
5 MPs won seats in July 2024 election. 3 defections occurred between Jan 16-26, 2026 (Jenrick, Rosindell, Braverman), bringing total to 8 as of late January 2026. This is the most relevant recent pattern.
*Suitability: High* - directly applicable timeframe and political context.

**Reference Class 3: Party defection waves historically**
When parties experience defection waves, they typically cluster in short periods then stop. The SDP received ~30 Labour defections in 1981-82, then few after. 
*Suitability: Moderate* - shows defections cluster but different magnitude/context.

**Selected Reference Class:** Reform UK defections 2024-2026, as it's most directly applicable.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** ~88 days (Feb 9 to May 7, 2026)

**Historical pattern (Jan 16-26, 2026):** 3 defections in 10 days, from 5 to 8 MPs.

**Key constraints:**
- Farage's explicit May 7 deadline for accepting defectors
- Current count: 8 MPs as of late Jan 2026
- Time remaining: ~2.5 months
- Agent report identifies several Conservative MPs who praised Farage or hinted at defection in January 2026: Sir John Hayes, Mark Francois, Esther McVey, Brandon Lewis

**Patterns:**
- Defections clustered in mid-late January 2026
- BBC mentioned a "Labour figure" would defect "next week" from Jan 18 (likely late January)
- Polling shows Reform "hit its ceiling" and 17% of Reform supporters turned more negative on defections
- Farage set conditions: defectors must admit Conservatives "broke the country" and bring value

## (d) Justification

Starting from 8 MPs as of late January 2026, I need to estimate additional defections by May 7, 2026.

**Factors suggesting few additional defections (8-10 range):**
- Polling shows Reform hit its ceiling and defections damaged brand with existing supporters
- Farage publicly stated Reform is "not a rescue charity" and set high bars for defectors
- Only 2 UKIP defections occurred historically despite years of opportunity
- Conservative MPs may wait to see local election results rather than defect beforehand
- The rapid cluster of 3 defections in 10 days may have exhausted immediate prospects

**Factors suggesting moderate additional defections (10-12 range):**
- Agent report identifies 4-5 Conservative MPs who made positive statements about Farage/Reform in January
- BBC reported a Labour defector coming (though unclear if this materialized)
- Brandon Lewis described as "obvious potential next defector"
- ~20% of Conservative voters became more favorable to Reform after defections
- May 7 deadline creates urgency for MPs considering defection

**Factors suggesting higher defections (12+ range):**
- Guardian reported 18 total parliamentarians joined, suggesting broader interest
- Multiple Conservative MPs named as potential defectors beyond those who already switched
- If local election polling shows Reform strength, could trigger last-minute defections before deadline

**Base rate calculation:**
- 3 defections in 10 days (Jan 16-26) = 0.3 per day
- 88 days remaining would suggest ~26 additional defections (clearly unrealistic)
- More realistic: defections cluster, then taper
- Likely pattern: 2-4 more defections over next 2.5 months

**Most likely outcome:** 10-11 MPs (2-3 additional defections from the current 8)

## Outside view calibration:

The distribution should be:
- **Centered around 10-11 MPs** (current 8 + 2-3 more defections)
- **Lower bound constrained by 8** (current count, could theoretically drop if MPs leave party, but highly unlikely)
- **Upper tail extending to 14-16** to account for surprise defection wave before deadline
- **10th percentile around 8-9** (minimal or no additional defections)
- **90th percentile around 13-14** (significant additional defections, but not a massive wave)

The key uncertainty is whether the January cluster was the main wave or if more MPs are waiting. The explicit May 7 deadline, combined with identified potential defectors, suggests 2-4 more defections are plausible. However, negative polling trends and Farage's public statements setting high bars suggest the party is being selective.

I'll set a distribution that:
- Assigns meaningful probability to status quo (8-9)
- Centers on modest growth (10-11)
- Allows for moderate surprise (12-14)
- Keeps extreme outcomes (15+) in the tail

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 8
Percentile 20: 9
Percentile 40: 10
Percentile 60: 11
Percentile 80: 12
Percentile 90: 13
