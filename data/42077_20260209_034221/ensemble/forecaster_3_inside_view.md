Analysis:
**1) Target variable / resolution criteria**
This resolves to the **integer count of sitting UK House of Commons MPs who are members of Reform UK on 7 May 2026 (MPs)**.

## (a) Source analysis (facts vs opinions; quality/date)
- **BBC (Feb 8, 2026) – Gorton & Denton by-election leaflet/imprint investigation**
  - **Facts:** By-election on **Feb 26, 2026**; Reform candidate **Matt Goodwin**; police investigating missing imprint; printer accepts responsibility.
  - **Opinion/claims:** Reform MP says “nothing wrong” / printer error.
  - **Quality:** High for event facts; doesn’t directly forecast MP totals but is relevant for **seat-gain risk** (campaign disruption).

- **Brookings (Dec 17, 2025) – “Back to the future? British politics in 2026”**
  - **Facts/claims with cited polling:** Starmer approval very low (Ipsos); Labour support down ~14; Reform has topped polls for over a year; Greens ~15%.
  - **Quality:** High-ish (reputable think tank) but still **macro** and not directly about MP defections; useful for “volatile system” context.

- **Guardian (Feb 4, 2026, Monbiot column)**
  - **Facts referenced:** 2024 vote/seat disproportionality; cites “analysis” about Reform translating votes to seats.
  - **Opinion:** Strongly argumentative; predictions about systemic collapse; bookies thinking Greens win Gorton & Denton (unclear sourcing).
  - **Quality:** Mixed; treat as **commentary** with a few checkable background facts.

- **Guardian (Jan 18, 2026, John Harris column)**
  - **Facts:** Farage’s **May 7 cutoff** for defections.
  - **Opinion:** “Reform and Tories same family,” speculation about “reconstitution.”
  - **Quality:** Mixed; cutoff detail aligns with other reporting, but most is interpretation.

- **BBC (Jan 18, 2026) – Farage: “not a rescue charity”; May 7 cutoff; mentions ~20 former Tory MPs joined**
  - **Facts:** Cutoff date; Farage conditions for defectors; “well-known Labour figure” to defect “next week” (forward-looking claim, not confirmed here).
  - **Quality:** High for what Farage said + cutoff; the “Labour figure” line is **unverified until it happens**.

- **BBC (Jan 26, 2026) – Braverman defection**
  - **Facts:** Braverman defected; total **8 MPs** as of late Jan 2026; confirms earlier Jenrick/Rosindell moves.
  - **Quality:** High and directly relevant.

- **AskNews/AOL (Feb 8, 2026) – Reform “shadow cabinet” plan**
  - **Facts:** Farage positioning party as credible opposition; mentions current MP count (some reports say 7—likely written before Braverman or using outdated figure).
  - **Opinion:** Political messaging from Farage; criticism from Conservatives.
  - **Quality:** Medium; useful for intent/strategy, but be cautious on counts.

- **AskNews/The Sun (Feb 8, 2026) – Farage campaign launch**
  - **Facts:** Similar narrative; mentions 8 MPs; “bookmakers’ favourite” claim.
  - **Quality:** Low-medium (tabloid); use mainly for **broad confirmation** of strategy, not fine-grained forecasting.

- **AskNews/Metro (Feb 7, 2026) – Goodwin childlessness tax controversy**
  - **Facts:** Shows controversial prior writings being surfaced.
  - **Quality:** Medium; relevant to by-election win probability (candidate drag).

- **AskNews/Mirror (Feb 7, 2026) – Labour candidate attack on Reform**
  - **Facts:** Standard campaigning; not predictive.
  - **Quality:** Low for forecasting (partisan framing).

- **AskNews/University of Manchester explainer (Jan 30, 2026)**
  - **Facts/analysis:** Notes complexity of Gorton & Denton; suggests Reform could benefit from left-split; references YouGov-style sentiment about Starmer in the North; mentions recent Runcorn & Helsby narrow loss for Labour (context).
  - **Quality:** Medium-high for contextual political analysis; still not a hard forecast.

- **AskNews/ITV (Dec 19, 2025) + Express/taz pieces on postponed locals and Reform legal action**
  - **Facts:** Some local elections postponed; Reform pursuing legal challenge; Electoral Commission criticism cited.
  - **Quality:** ITV relatively strong; Express/taz more variable. Indirect relevance (may affect momentum/defection incentives), but MPs count impact is second-order.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
**Strong evidence (large shifts)**
1. **Current baseline is anchored at 8 MPs** (BBC Jan 26). This heavily constrains downside in a short window.
2. **May 7 “defection acceptance” cutoff is repeatedly reported** (BBC Jan 18; echoed elsewhere). Structural timing pressure: if MPs want to switch *and be counted by May 7*, they must act soon.

**Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)**
1. **A live by-election on Feb 26, 2026** (BBC Feb 8) creates a real pathway to **+1 MP** independent of defections.
2. **Highly volatile national environment** (Brookings; broader reporting of Labour turmoil) plausibly increases defection rate vs historical UKIP-era baselines.
3. **Signals of further recruitment/positioning** (AOL/Sun shadow cabinet moves) suggest Reform is actively trying to look “government-ready,” which can marginally increase MP willingness to cross.

**Weak evidence (small shifts)**
1. Leaflet/imprint investigation + Goodwin controversy (BBC/Metro) could hurt Reform in the by-election, but effects are uncertain and can be offset by national swing.
2. Commentary pieces (Guardian columns) are mostly narrative, not decision-relevant quantified evidence.
3. Claims like “well-known Labour figure will defect next week” (BBC Jan 18) remain **speculative until verified**; I give it limited weight.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time left:** From **Feb 9, 2026 to May 7, 2026 ≈ 87 days (~3 months)**.
- If the timeframe were **halved (~6 weeks)**: fewer opportunities—likely **0–1 defections** and just the by-election; distribution would shift down about **~1 MP** at the median.
- If the timeframe were **doubled (~6 months)**: more parliamentary shocks/by-elections + more time for coordinated defection waves; upper tail would widen materially (more 15+ outcomes).

## (d) Justification: updating the outside view to an inside view
**Outside view base rate (given):** centered on **10–11 MPs** by May 7, with 90th ≈ 13.

**Why I shift upward (but not explosively):**
1. **By-election is a concrete seat-gain channel** that the outside view may underweight. Even with meaningful uncertainty, it adds a **discrete +1** possibility before May 7.
2. **Defections already demonstrated in a tight cluster (mid/late Jan)**, suggesting the process is “unfrozen.” With an explicit deadline, I expect at least **some** additional movement, but:
3. **Counterweight:** Farage’s “not a rescue charity” posture + reputational risks (base voters disliking too many Tory imports; candidate controversies) plausibly limits a mass wave within 87 days.

**Net effect:** modest upward adjustment to the center and a wider upper tail versus the outside view, while keeping **8 MPs** a meaningful low-end outcome (status quo persistence is common).

Distribution calibration
- **Status quo if nothing changes:** **8 MPs**.
- **Trend-continued scenario:** a couple more defections plus a plausible by-election gain → often **11–13 MPs**.
- **Main “No growth” path:** by-election loss + zero further defections (or one defection offset by a resignation/discipline event) → **8–9 MPs**.
- **Main “higher growth” path:** 4–6 additional defectors (especially late April “deadline effects”) + by-election win → **14–16 MPs**.
- **Tail risk up:** a coordinated mini-wave (e.g., leadership crisis in Conservatives) could push beyond this, but I keep that mostly above my 90th given time constraints and selectiveness.

Checklist:
1. **Paraphrase:** Number of Reform UK MPs sitting in Commons **on 7 May 2026**, measured in **MPs**.
2. **Outside view distribution (given):** P10 8, P20 9, P40 10, P60 11, P80 12, P90 13.
3. **Consistency check:** Implied median ≈ between P40/P60 → ~11.5; mean ≈ ~12. This fits “8 now + (2–4 defections) + (by-election chance)”.
4. **Top evidence (3–5):**
   - BBC Jan 26: Reform currently **8 MPs** (hard anchor).
   - BBC Jan 18 + others: **May 7 cutoff** creates deadline pressure.
   - BBC Feb 8: **Feb 26 by-election** offers discrete +1 MP route.
   - Brookings: unusually **volatile** party system; Reform strong in polls (context for defections).
   - Campaign/legal controversies around by-election candidate (BBC/Metro) slightly reduce seat-gain odds.
5. **Blind spot:** A sudden **large coordinated defection wave** (or formal Tory-Reform accommodation) before May 7 would push outcome **up** well beyond my 90th.
6. **Status quo nudge:** I keep **P10 at 8** to respect inertia and the real possibility of no further growth.
7. **Technicalities:** Percentiles strictly increasing; units = MPs; values within bounds (upper tail not constrained by 30.5).
