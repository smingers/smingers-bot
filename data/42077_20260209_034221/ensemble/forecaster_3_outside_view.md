Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; facts vs opinions)

1) **QMUL (Barnfield), Feb 6 2026**
- **What it is:** Academic commentary using **YouGov polling** on perceptions of Reform vs Conservatives after defections.
- **Key factual inputs:** Reported polling deltas (e.g., perceived difference between Reform/Conservatives down ~10 points since Sept; **17% of Reform supporters more negative** after defections; **>20% of Conservatives more favourable**).
- **Opinions/interpretation:** “Tory party 2.0” brand risk; defections may help among Conservatives but risk alienating anti-establishment Reform supporters/nonvoters.
- **Quality:** High for *framing incentives* and *directional effects* (poll-backed); weaker for predicting specific MP counts.

2) **AOL report, Jan 19 2026 (quotes from Jenrick/Bull/Farage)**
- **Key facts:** Confirms recent defectors and an MP count claim (“Reform now has seven MPs” as of Jan 19).
- **Opinions:** Rally rhetoric about replacing Conservatives.
- **Quality:** Medium—secondary outlet but mostly direct quotes. Useful for confirming *momentum and stated deadline salience*.

3) **The Guardian explainer, Jan 15 2026**
- **Key facts:** Names some defectors and “possible next defectors”; reiterates Farage **cutoff after May elections**.
- **Opinions:** Narrative about benefits/risks; “Conservatives 2.0” framing.
- **Quality:** High for UK political reporting and names; “may follow” list is inherently speculative.

4) **GB News, Jan 20 2026**
- **Key facts:** Scottish polling snippet; commentary that Reform may have “hit its ceiling” (attributed to Opinium associate director).
- **Relevance to MP count:** Indirect—could affect the *incentive* for MPs to jump if Reform looks capped.
- **Quality:** Mixed; the polling excerpt is usable, but the story is not primarily about Westminster defections.

5) **BBC News, Jan 18 2026**
- **Key facts:** Confirms Farage’s **May 7 cutoff** and sets conditions (“not a rescue charity…”). Mentions Reform expecting a “well-known Labour figure” to defect soon.
- **Quality:** High—BBC is strong for verifiable statements and party positioning. The “Labour figure next week” is a *claim*; still relevant as an indicator of intent.

6) **Agent report (compiled list of historic and current switches; Jan 2026 Tory comments)**
- **Key facts synthesized:** Historic examples (Carswell/Reckless to UKIP), and recent Reform switches; also lists Tory MPs praising Farage or hinting at switching (e.g., Hayes/Francois/McVey mentioned as “possible”).
- **Quality:** Medium. It’s a secondary synthesis and may contain omissions; still useful for identifying a **reference class** and the *type* of MPs publicly flirting with defection.

**Bottom line from sources:** We have (i) a clear, credible May 7 cutoff; (ii) evidence that defections can improve Reform’s standing among Conservatives but risk brand dilution; (iii) reporting that more switches are plausible but not necessarily a “big wave” imminently (BBC); and (iv) lists of “possible defectors” (speculative).

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view candidates)

We want a base-rate estimate of **additional MPs switching to a smaller/right-populist party over ~3 months**, given an existing small parliamentary foothold.

Possible reference classes:

1) **UKIP 2014–2015 defections (Carswell, Reckless)**
- **Similarity:** Right-populist challenger; Conservative-origin MPs switching.
- **Difference:** UKIP had strong European-election momentum but faced by-elections and different electoral incentives.
- **Usefulness:** Good anchor that such defections can happen but often remain **small-number** events.

2) **Change UK / Independent Group (2019)**
- **Similarity:** Mid-parliament switching; a “new-ish” party trying to snowball via MPs.
- **Difference:** Cross-pressured ideological coalition; quickly unstable; not a clean analogue to Reform’s right-bloc consolidation.
- **Usefulness:** Good for *upper-tail possibility* (can reach ~10+ MPs briefly), but instability/collapse differs.

3) **SDP formation (1981)**
- **Similarity:** High-profile defections in a short window.
- **Difference:** Much larger realignment moment; different party system era; not “small party climbing from 5 MPs.”
- **Usefulness:** Mostly for a **fat-tail** argument (waves are possible), but probably overstates typical outcomes.

**Chosen reference class (most suitable):**
- A hybrid of (1) and (2): **mid-parliament defections to a challenger party** in the modern media era, where the modal outcome is **a handful of switches**, with occasional but rarer surges into low double digits.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Today:** Feb 9, 2026  
- **Target date:** May 7, 2026  
- **Time left:** ~87 days (~3 months)

Over 3 months, large changes in MP party labels usually require:
- a **triggering event** (leadership crisis, polling shock, scandal, by-election shock),
- a **credible destination party** (career/reelection logic),
- and **coordination** (MPs moving in clusters).

Absent a major shock, the typical pattern is: **initial burst** after a headline defection, then **slowing** as remaining MPs wait, bargain, or decide it’s too risky.

Also, **May 7 is explicitly a cutoff**, which can pull forward decisions into this window (increasing near-term switching versus a window with no deadline).

---

### (d) Justification (outside view)

**Status quo:** Reform currently has **8 MPs** (given in the question background). Without further defections, the answer is 8.

**Forces pushing the number higher (Yes-more-defectors path):**
- A hard, public **deadline** can accelerate decisions.
- Some Conservatives may see Reform as a safer long-run home if they believe Reform will replace the Conservatives (rhetoric noted in AOL/BBC).
- Reported polling reactions among Conservatives in the QMUL/YouGov summary suggest defections can make Reform look **more viable** to Conservative voters, which may reduce perceived electoral risk for Tory MPs contemplating a switch.

**Forces keeping the number near current levels (No-big-wave path):**
- Farage’s “not a rescue charity” stance (BBC) implies **screening**, limiting volume.
- Brand dilution risks (QMUL) suggest Reform may become cautious about taking too many ex-Tories quickly, or some Reform supporters may react negatively—both can reduce momentum.
- Reporting suggests senior Conservatives expect **some** further defections but **not a big wave imminently** (BBC paraphrase).

**Outside-view central tendency:** In comparable modern UK episodes, sitting-MP defections to a challenger party typically add **a few** MPs over a few months, not dozens—unless there is a major party-system rupture.

So, starting from **8 MPs**, an outside-view expectation is something like **+1 to +4** net MPs by May 7, with an outside chance of a larger cluster.

Outside view calibration:

- I’m aiming for a **true uncertainty distribution** with **fat tails** (political coordination cascades happen).
- Key uncertainty drivers that justify width:
  - whether there is a **news shock** (polling collapse, leadership challenge, scandal),
  - whether Reform **actively recruits** MPs for credibility vs resists to protect brand,
  - whether any current Reform MPs **leave/are suspended** (low probability but nonzero).
- Given only ~3 months, the *most likely* outcomes cluster near 8–12, but a plausible (low-probability) surge could reach the mid-teens.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 7  
Percentile 20: 8  
Percentile 40: 9  
Percentile 60: 10  
Percentile 80: 12  
Percentile 90: 16
