Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (key, dated ≤ 9 Feb 2026)

1. BBC, 18 Jan 2026 – factual: Reform now on 8 MPs, Farage sets 7 May cut-off, warns against “lifeboat” defectors; quality: high, first-hand quotes.
2. BBC, 26 Jan 2026 – factual: Suella Braverman becomes eighth MP; lists c.20 ex-Tory ex-MP joiners; quality: high.
3. Guardian, 18 Jan 2026 – mostly opinion; confirms Jenrick defection and May cut-off; quality: solid reporting, analysis is commentary.
4. AOL / Sun, 8 Feb 2026 – factual: shadow-cabinet launch planned; still 8 MPs; opinions on electoral strategy; quality: mid.
5. Brookings, 17 Dec 2025 – polling context: Reform “topped polls for over a year”; quality: reputable think-tank but not MP-specific.
6. QMUL/YouGov (cited via BBC & Guardian) – polling that Tory defections increase Conservative voters’ favourability toward Reform but alienate 17 % of existing Reform backers; quality: single, methodologically transparent survey.
7. Local by-election coverage (BBC 8 Feb 2026 & Manchester Univ 30 Jan 2026) – factual: Gorton & Denton vote on 26 Feb; Labour majority 13 k in 2024; competitive three-/four-way; quality: good.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong
• Structural: only three months remain until the publicly declared 7 May deadline – hard stop.
• Historical: UKIP 2014-15 & Change-UK 2019 show mid-parliament defections rarely exceed low double digits.

Moderate
• Multiple reliable reports of 4 sitting Tory defections in 11 days ⇒ momentum.
• Credible polling (YouGov) that defections make further switches palatable to Tory MPs.

Weak
• Rumours of “well-known Labour” figure; speculative lists of possible defectors.
• Possibility of by-elections other than Gorton & Denton.

(c) Timeframe analysis

Time left: c. 87 days. Halving (6 weeks) would sharply reduce defecting window and cut expected extra MPs ~40 %. Doubling (6 months) would reopen the game for summer waves and raise mean by maybe +3.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment

Status quo = 8 MPs.

Upside drivers
• Fresh Tory turmoil and Starmer scandals keep Reform polling first; makes defection electorally rational.
• A public deadline incentivises “now-or-never” action; cluster behaviour common (reference: SDP 1981, Change-UK 2019).

Downside / brakes
• Farage signals gate-keeping (“not a rescue charity”), screening out some hopefuls.
• Brand-dilution fears: YouGov finds 17 % of Reform supporters more negative after Tory influx.
• Only one certain electoral opportunity (Gorton & Denton) before 7 May, and Reform is at best competitive, not favourite.

Quantitative sketch
Expected new Tory/other defections: mean = 2.5 (range 0-7).
Chance Reform wins Gorton&Denton: ~30 % => +0.3 seat expectation.
Attrition risk (health/scandal/whip withdrawn): 0-1, mean -0.1.

8 + 2.5 + 0.3 - 0.1 ≈ 10.7 ⇒ set median 11, mean ≈ 11.2. Fat-tail allowance for a late surge (co-ordinated group of 8-10 MPs).

Distribution calibration

Percentile 10: 8 MPs  
Percentile 20: 9 MPs  
Percentile 40: 10 MPs  
Percentile 60: 11 MPs  
Percentile 80: 13 MPs  
Percentile 90: 16 MPs

Checklist:

1. Target variable paraphrase – “Number of House-of-Commons MPs sitting for Reform UK on 7 May 2026”.
2. Outside-view base: modal 8-12, tails 7/16.
3. Consistency – implied median = 11, mean ≈ 11.2; justifiable vs reasoning.
4. Key evidence (i) 8 MP baseline; (ii) May-7 deadline; (iii) four Tory switches in 11 days; (iv) gate-keeping rhetoric; (v) Gorton&Denton by-election odds.
5. Blind-spot – sudden Conservative collapse triggering >15 coordinated defections (pushes outcome up).
6. Status-quo anchor considered (8 MPs).
7. Percentiles increasing, within bounds (-0.5, 30.5), units = MPs.
