Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
1. Queen Mary Univ. piece (6 Feb 2026).  Academic author, credible; mainly survey data on how voters react to Tory defections.  Factual polling numbers are solid; comments about brand dilution are informed opinion.  No hard facts about additional MPs.  
2. AOL story (19 Jan 2026).  Straight newswire; confirms Jenrick and Rosindell defections and quotes Jenrick on “decide soon”.  Good factual chronology.  
3. Guardian explainer (15 Jan 2026).  Quality broadsheet; inventories current and potential defectors.  Facts about who is in / who might join are reliable; speculation on future names is opinion.  
4. GB News (20 Jan 2026).  Mixed-quality outlet; here it focuses on Scottish polling and Curtice seat model.  Little directly relevant; quality adequate for factual numbers, weaker for commentary.  
5. BBC (18 Jan 2026).  High-quality.  Confirms Farage’s 7 May cut-off and that “around 20” ex-Tory parliamentarians have moved.  Factual quotes from Farage are reliable; “well-known Labour figure” rumour is unverified.  
6. Agent report (compiled 26 Jan 2026).  Secondary synthesis of press coverage; useful list of names and historical defections.  Treat as reasonably accurate where it cites mainstream outlets.

b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates:  
• Mid-parliament defections to minor UK parties (e.g., UKIP 2010-15) – two defections over six months.  
• Cross-party moves in the 1997-2001 parliament (several but still <10).  
• Current parliament (2024-26) already shows 5→8 Reform MPs in seven months.  
Because the same personalities and incentives (right-wing Tory MPs under threat, charismatic Farage) are unique to this cycle, the best reference class is “defections to Reform UK in this parliament to date”.

c) Time-frame analysis  
Today → resolution: 88 days (≈3 months).  Historical data: in the past seven months Reform averaged one new MP every ≈30 days.  Applying that crude rate would suggest ~3 more by 7 May.  However, hazard likely decays: the most willing MPs have already jumped, and Farage’s public deadline removes the final 3-week tail (after 7 May).  

d) Justification for outside view  
Base rate: Mini-parties seldom exceed two defections in a whole parliament.  Nonetheless Reform already has 8, showing we are in a fat-tail environment.  
Down-side forces:  • Death/ill-health or disqualification by-elections (~2-3 per 12 months nationally).  For 8 MPs over 3 months, probability ≈5-7 % that Reform net total falls by 1.  
Upside forces:  • Remaining pool of ~25 right-wing Tory MPs named by press as sympathetic.  • Public deadline and “last chance” dynamic.  • Polls show plateauing support, which may deter moderates.  
Expert/market sentiment: commentariat now talks about “a handful more” rather than a flood.  
Putting these together the outside view mean is “a couple more”, modal value 10-11, with wide tails for 7 on the low side and 15 on the high side.

Outside view calibration:
• Distribution anchored at current 8.  
• Down-tail: one unexpected loss or resignation → 7 (≈10th pct).  Falling to 6 or below would require two simultaneous negative shocks (<5 %).  
• Central mass: 0–3 additional defections (8-11).  
• Upper-tail: coordination cascade could bring 4-7 extra (12-15).  More than 15 would need >8 further MPs in <3 months, historically unprecedented but not impossible; assign <<10 % beyond 15.  
CDF is mapped accordingly.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 7  
Percentile 20: 8  
Percentile 40: 9  
Percentile 60: 11  
Percentile 80: 13  
Percentile 90: 15
