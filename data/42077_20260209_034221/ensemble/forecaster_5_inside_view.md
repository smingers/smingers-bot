Analysis:
a) Source analysis (chronological key items, 2026 unless noted)
1. BBC 18 Jan – reports Jenrick defection, quotes Farage’s “no more defections after 7 May”. High factual reliability, contemporaneous.
2. Guardian 18 Jan – commentary on defections; factual list of MPs already moved, all sourced; opinions are columnist’s.
3. BBC 26 Jan – factual confirmation Suella Braverman defected; Reform now 8 MPs. High quality.
4. BBC 8 Feb – Gorton & Denton by-election leaflet story; only relevant because it confirms 26 Feb poll date. Factual, neutral.
5. Brookings 17 Dec 25 – polling trends (Reform leading for “over a year”). Academic analysis; still recent enough.
6. AOL / Sun 8 Feb – Farage to unveil shadow cabinet; repeats current MP count (8) and acceptance-deadline. Wire-style report, factual.
7. Express / other partisan outlets – quote Reform claims of 268 k members, poll leads; useful only where figures corroborated elsewhere (moderate reliability).

b) Evidence analysis
Strong
• Stated cut-off: Farage says no new MPs accepted after 7 May (BBC 18 Jan) – structural constraint.
• Current count = 8 confirmed by multiple independent outlets.

Moderate
• Conservative turmoil & precedent of three defections in 11 days suggest some further MPs may cross (pattern, but uncertain size).
• Gorton & Denton by-election 26 Feb could add one seat (polling volatile, four-way race).
• Historical: mid-Parliament parties rarely lose MPs within three months unless scandal (base rate low).

Weak
• Partisan claims that “around 20 MPs are thinking of jumping ship” – unattributed or speculative.
• Bookmaker chatter about Greens winning Gorton & Denton – single data point, no polling methodology published.

c) Timeframe analysis
Resolution in 88 days.  If the window were halved (44 days) I would lower the upper tail (fewer defections can materialise) by ≈0.5 MP; if doubled (176 days) I would raise the 80th–90th percentiles by ≈1 MP because more time for shocks and extra by-elections.

d) Justification / inside-view shift
Base-rate centred on status-quo 8 MPs with modest right-skew (outside view median = 9, p90 = 13).
Adjustments:
+ Conservative instability (moderate): +0.8 MP expected defections.
+ Single plausible by-election win (weak-to-moderate): +0.25 MP.
– Possibility of a resignation/whip withdrawal (weak): –0.1 MP.
Net +0.95 ≈ +1 MP versus status quo.  This nudges the median to 9, keeps long right tail for unlikely 4 + defections, and a thin left tail for one MP loss.

Distribution calibration
Mean ≈ 9.8, median ≈ 9.  Outside view percentiles shifted upward by about one seat on 40th–90th lines to reflect added evidence.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: number of Reform UK MPs in House of Commons on 7 May 2026 (integer).
2. Outside view shown; final distribution rooted in it.
3. Consistency: implied median = 9, mean ≈ 9.8; matches reasoning.
4. Key evidence: a) Reform now 8 MPs. b) Farage cut-off 7 May. c) Recent burst of 3 Tory defections. d) Gorton & Denton by-election scheduled 26 Feb.
5. Blind-spot: Sudden mass Conservative collapse leading to 6-10 extra defections in March-April (would push outcome up).
6. Status-quo bias checked – 10 th percentile still 7 MPs.
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, within bounds.
