Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Queen Mary University article (6 Feb 2026) – peer-reviewed academic blogpost.  Factual polling figures and expert commentary by political scientist Matthew Barnfield.  High quality for attitudes but gives no hard count of MPs.  
2. AOL report (19 Jan 2026) – mainstream newswire syndication.  Factual on dates of Jenrick & Rosindell defections, contains direct quotes.  Reliable for “what happened”; speculative when quoting politicians on hopes.  
3. Guardian explainer (15 Jan 2026) – respected newspaper, lists confirmed and rumoured defectors.  Clear line between facts (who has moved) and opinion (risk of “Tory party 2.0”).  
4. GB News piece (20 Jan 2026) – partisan-leaning outlet; facts on Scottish polling look credible but are tangential to Westminster head-count.  Opinions from commentators are coloured by outlet’s stance.  
5. BBC report (18 Jan 2026) – broadcaster of record.  Provides Farage’s explicit “no more defectors after 7 May” rule and gives approximate total of “around 20” former Tory MPs now in Reform.  High factual reliability.  
6. Agent report (compiled 9 Feb 2026) – secondary synthesis of media coverage since 2010.  Useful chronology of previous right-wing defections, but not an original source; treat as convenience summary.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates  
i. Minor/insurgent UK parties’ Westminster seat totals between general elections since 1945 (e.g., SDP, UKIP, Change UK, GB Party).  
ii. Right-populist parties’ MP counts in UK since 2010 (UKIP & Brexit Party).  
iii. All House-of-Commons mid-term defections 1979-2026 (number joining a single party in a six-month window).  

Option ii matches ideology, parliamentary context and recent era, so I adopt it.  The class has a narrow historic range: UKIP peaked at 2 MPs (2014-15); Brexit Party at 0.  Reform UK already sits at 8, well outside historical precedent, suggesting tail risks of large further jumps are modest.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days to resolution: 88.  Historically, most defections in a Parliament occur in clusters immediately after a high-profile first mover; the current burst (Jan 2026) mirrors that.  Further defectors usually dwindle after 2-3 months.  By-elections inside 88 days are few; only if a Conservative MP dies/resigns very soon could a 7 May by-election coincide with locals.

(d) Justification for outside view  
Status quo: 8 MPs.  
Pathways to decrease:  
• Triggered recall petition or resignation (low-probability in <3 months).  
• Whip withdrawn from a Reform MP or personal scandal (non-zero but rare).  

Pathways to increase:  
• Additional Conservative (or very occasionally Labour) defections before 7 May.  The Guardian long-list of “possibles” is <10 names, but Farage’s public coolness plus activists’ backlash (17 % of Reform supporters turned more negative) will deter some.  I estimate a 50 % chance of 0–1 more defectors, 35 % chance of 2–3, and 15 % of 4 +.  
• By-election wins.  Only plausible if a vacancy is announced almost immediately; base rate for seats turning over to a new minor party in a by-election within three months is <5 %.  Treated as a tail risk worth roughly +0.2 MP in expectation.

Outside view calibration:

Base-rate mean from reference class = 1.3 MPs; we are in an outlier situation (already 8).  Therefore I centre the prior on the current figure and allow a modest right-skew for extra defections, with thin left tail for shock losses.  Historical surprise rate for mid-term parliamentary head-counts (~10 % of cases exceed conventional wisdom) informs a wider 90 –10 band of six seats.  Distribution anchored so each percentile is strictly increasing.

Outside View Prediction:  
Percentile 10: 7  
Percentile 20: 8  
Percentile 40: 9  
Percentile 60: 10  
Percentile 80: 11  
Percentile 90: 13
