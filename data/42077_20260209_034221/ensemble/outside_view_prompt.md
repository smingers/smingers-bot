The forecasting question is:
How many MPs will Reform UK have on May 7, 2026?

Question background:
Reform UK is a British political party founded in 2018 as the Brexit Party, renamed in January 2021. The party is led by Nigel Farage, who serves as MP for Clacton.

At the July 2024 general election, Reform UK won 5 seats. Since then, several Conservative MPs have defected:

* Robert Jenrick (Newark) - January 16, 2026
* Andrew Rosindell (Romford) - January 18, 2026
* Suella Braverman (Fareham and Waterlooville) - January 26, 2026

As of late January 2026, Reform UK has 8 MPs in the House of Commons. The party has publicly stated that May 7, 2026 (the date of the upcoming local elections) is the cutoff date for accepting defecting MPs and councillors.

# Summary of Article: "Reform has been warned that defecting Tories will damage its brand – and the first evidence is in"

**Source:** Queen Mary University of London  
**Date:** February 06, 2026  
**Author:** Matthew Barnfield, Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Politics and International Relations

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Polling Data on Party Differentiation (YouGov):**
- The proportion of people who see Reform and the Conservatives as different has fallen by 10 percentage points since September

**Polling Data on Voter Opinions Post-Defections:**
- 63% of Labour voters, 67% of Liberal Democrat voters, and 64% of Green voters had negative views of Reform before defections and haven't changed their opinions
- Among Conservative voters, approximately half (compared to the above percentages) maintain unchanged negative opinions of Reform
- Almost a quarter (≈25%) of Conservative voters say they were already positive about Reform and remain so, compared to around 5% for supporters of other parties
- Over a fifth (>20%) of Conservative voters now have a more favorable view of Reform as a result of the defections
- Negligible numbers of other parties' supporters have become more favorable toward Reform
- **17% of Reform supporters say the defections have made them more negative about the party** – the highest figure for any party's supporters

## Key Analysis and Opinions:

**From Matthew Barnfield (named academic source):**
- There is debate about whether Conservative defectors benefit or harm Reform UK
- Risk that Reform is tying its image to the unpopular Conservative government
- Danger of becoming "Tory party 2.0"
- Reform is unlikely to win over Labour, Liberal Democrat, or Green voters (the "left bloc")
- Reform and Conservatives form the "right bloc" – voters rarely move between blocs, only within them
- Reform has done especially well at attracting people who did not vote at all in 2024
- Risk that voters who didn't vote in 2024 may disengage again if Reform looks too much like part of the traditional party system

**Strategic implications identified:**
- If Reform is to push past its recent polling plateau, it will mostly likely be by winning over more Conservative voters
- The defections help Reform appear more viable and improve Conservative voters' opinions
- However, the defections risk turning off existing Reform supporters and potential voters who were attracted to Reform as an alternative to the mainstream

# Summary of Guardian Article: "Tory defectors: who has already joined Reform UK and who may follow?"

**Date:** January 15, 2026  
**Author:** Kiran Stacey

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Total defectors:** With Robert Jenrick's defection, 18 current or former parliamentarians have joined Reform UK from the Conservatives.

- **Farage's deadline:** Nigel Farage stated he would accept no further defectors from the Tories after the May elections, arguing that by then his party's strength would be so clear that additional defectors would have little value to add.

## Current Reform UK MPs (mentioned in article):

1. **Lee Anderson** (Ashfield) - First ever Reform MP, defected in 2024 from Conservatives after having whip removed
2. **Nadine Dorries** - Former culture secretary, defected in September (note: article doesn't specify if she's currently an MP)
3. **Danny Kruger** (East Wiltshire) - Defected, described as giving the party "intellectual heft," put in charge of costing policies
4. **Nadhim Zahawi** - Former Conservative chancellor, defected "earlier this week" (relative to January 15, 2026)

## Potential Future Defectors Discussed:

- **Jacob Rees-Mogg** (former business secretary) - Lost his seat in 2024 election, so not currently an MP. Quoted as saying he doesn't see joining Reform as advancing Conservative-Reform unity.
- **Brandon Lewis** (former Northern Ireland secretary) - Described as "obvious potential next defector"
- **Suella Braverman** (former home secretary) - Her husband joined Reform then left after party criticized her
- **Nusrat Ghani (Lam)** (Conservative MP for Weald of Kent) - Close ally of Jenrick, seen as potential defector
- **Nick Timothy** (Conservative MP for West Suffolk) - Ally of Jenrick, but "chances of defection plummeted" when he accepted shadow justice portfolio

## Context:

The article characterizes the defections as bringing both benefits and risks to Reform UK, with some figures bringing ministerial experience or intellectual credibility, while others (like Zahawi with his tax affairs baggage) risk depicting Reform as "the Conservatives 2.0."

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

**George Buchan (GB Insight):**
- Scottish elections will be "a more serious test for Reform's appeal than what has gone so far"
- Scottish politics diverges from UK trends
- Scotland leans left overall, and figures like Nigel Farage have historically underperformed compared to 'One Nation' leaders

**James Crouch (Associate Director at Opinium):**
- Reform "appears to have hit its ceiling across the UK"
- In Scotland, Reform required taking votes from "surprising different parties" to reach their poll numbers
- Various parties across the political spectrum are benefiting from a downturn in Reform vote share

**John Swinney (SNP):**
- Nigel Farage is "a long-term opponent of the Scottish Parliament and devolution"
- Farage "holds the Scottish Parliament in total contempt"
- Warning: "if Nigel Farage becomes the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom, I think the Scottish Parliament's days are numbered"

## Additional Context:

- The article notes Reform had nine consecutive polls showing growth in Scotland before this decline
- The poll found majority of supporters of all parties (except Conservatives) would back whoever was best placed to defeat Reform
- Timeline reference: "just over 100 days until the Holyrood elections" from the article date

**Note:** This article focuses primarily on Scottish polling and the Holyrood elections rather than Westminster MPs. It does not provide specific information about the number of Reform UK MPs in the House of Commons or potential future defections to the party.

<Agent_report>
Query: List of MPs who defected to UKIP, Brexit Party or Reform UK since 2010 and any public statements since Jan 2026 by Conservative MPs praising Farage or hinting at defection
Below is an integrated answer to both parts of the query, built only from the material in the search results cited after every item.

A. Conservative-origin MPs who have defected to UKIP, the Brexit Party or Reform UK since 2010  

1. Defections to UKIP  
   • Douglas Carswell – MP for Clacton; left the Conservatives and triggered a by-election won for UKIP in Aug 2014 (Guardian, 26 Mar 2017).  
   • Mark Reckless – MP for Rochester & Strood; followed Carswell and defected at the opening of the 2014 Tory conference, also fighting and winning a by-election for UKIP (Prospect, undated article quoted in results).  

2. Defections to the Brexit Party (2019)  
   No sitting Conservative MP crossed directly to the Brexit Party while still in Parliament, but two former Tory MPs who had left Parliament did so:  
   • Ann Widdecombe – ex Conservative MP (1997-2010); joined the Brexit Party to stand in the 2019 European elections (Telegraph, 26 Jan 2026 list).  
   • Mark Reckless – after losing his Commons seat in 2015 he later joined Farage’s Brexit Party in 2019 and led it in Wales (Telegraph, 26 Jan 2026 list).

3. Defections to Reform UK (2024-26) – sitting MPs  
   • Lee Anderson – defected Mar 2024 after losing the Tory whip (Telegraph, 26 Jan 2026).  
   • Danny Kruger – defected Sept 2025, calling the Conservatives “finished” (Telegraph, 26 Jan 2026).  
   • Robert Jenrick – expelled by the Tories and defected 15 Jan 2026 (Guardian, 15 Jan 2026; Telegraph, 26 Jan 2026).  
   • Andrew Rosindell – defected 19 Jan 2026 (Sky News, 19 Jan 2026).  
   • Suella Braverman – defected 26 Jan 2026 (AP News, 26 Jan 2026; Independent, 26 Jan 2026).  

4. Defections to Reform UK (2025-26) – former or defeated MPs who re-entered politics with Reform  
   • Nadhim Zahawi – ex MP, ex Chancellor; joined 12 Jan 2026 (Independent, 26 Jan 2026).  
   • Jake Berry, David Jones, Marco Longhi, Anne Marie Morris, Dame Andrea Jenkyns, Henry Smith, Chris Green, Ben Bradley, Brendan Clarke-Smith, Jonathan Gullis, Adam Holloway and others named in the Telegraph’s roll-call of 27 former or current Tories now in Reform (Telegraph, 26 Jan 2026).  
   (These individuals were no longer sitting MPs when they jumped, but they satisfy the request for “MPs who defected … since 2010”.)

B. Public comments by Conservative MPs since 1 Jan 2026 praising Nigel Farage or openly hinting at a switch to Reform UK  

1. Suella Braverman (still a Tory at the time) – 15 Jan 2026 told journalists “I like Nigel Farage … there isn’t space in British politics for two conservative parties,” refusing to rule out joining him (Telegraph, 15 Jan 2026). She defected 11 days later.  

2. Sir John Hayes – veteran right-wing Tory MP; on 15 Jan 2026 admitted his views and Reform’s overlapped “to a huge degree” and pressed his party to adopt Reform’s “net-zero immigration” policy, while saying he would “stay for now” (Telegraph, 15 Jan 2026).  

3. Andrew Rosindell – then still Conservative – October 2025 interview resurfaced in Telegraph 15 Jan 2026 where he said his seat would “almost certainly go to Reform” and that he could “serve alongside Mr Farage” in a coalition. He defected 19 Jan 2026.  

4. Mark Francois – shadow cabinet member – quoted 15 Jan 2026 as sharing Farage’s Eurosceptic values; denied immediate plans to defect but was listed among those most likely to move (Telegraph, 15 Jan 2026).  

5. Esther McVey – former “common-sense” minister – argued in 2025 that the Tories should let Reform win a by-election; Telegraph on 15 Jan 2026 again named her as a possible defector, reporting her line that many Tory members now hold dual membership with Reform (Telegraph, 15 Jan 2026).  

Collectively those statements fulfil the brief for January 2026-dated praise of Farage or explicit flirtation with joining Reform by people who, at the moment they spoke, still held the Conservative whip.

C. Observations and outstanding information gaps  

• The main data missing is a definitive list of every ex-Conservative MP who has gone to UKIP or the Brexit Party between 2010-23. The sources supplied capture the two headline UKIP cases (Carswell, Reckless) but may omit any short-lived or less-publicised switches (e.g. no sources confirm if any minor figures between 2010-14 briefly crossed).  

• Likewise, the Brexit Party era (spring-summer 2019) may include other former Tory MPs besides Widdecombe and Reckless who endorsed or stood for the party; no direct list appears in the results.  

• No open-source article in the results lists Conservative MPs praising Farage after 26 Jan 2026 – material beyond that date might reveal new hints or endorsements.  

If total completeness is required, additional targeted searches such as “Conservative MP defected to UKIP 2012”, “Brexit Party former Tory MP 2019”, or “Farage praised by Tory MP February 2026” would firm up any remaining edge cases. At present, however, all high-profile, well-documented defections and January 2026 Conservative praise/hints captured by national outlets are covered above.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
