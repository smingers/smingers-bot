The party is led by Nigel Farage, who serves as MP for Clacton.\n\nAt the July 2024 general election, Reform UK won 5 seats. Since then, several Conservative MPs have defected:\n\n* Robert Jenrick (Newark) - January 16, 2026\n* Andrew Rosindell (Romford) - January 18, 2026\n* Suella Braverman (Fareham and Waterlooville) - January 26, 2026\n\nAs of late January 2026, Reform UK has 8 MPs in the House of Commons. The party has publicly stated that May 7, 2026 (the date of the upcoming local elections) is the cutoff date for accepting defecting MPs and councillors.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":42026,\"question_id\":41768}}`",
