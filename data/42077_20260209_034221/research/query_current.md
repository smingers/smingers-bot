Analysis:
To project how many MPs Reform UK will have on 7 May 2026, the key variable is further movement of sitting MPs—especially Conservative back-benchers—either defecting to, or leaving, the party before the cut-off date. Information to track includes:  
• Confirmed defections after 26 Jan 2026.  
• Credible rumours or public statements by MPs about joining Reform UK.  
• By-election prospects involving Reform UK candidates.  
• Any suspensions, resignations, or health issues that could reduce their current tally of eight.  
The most relevant articles will therefore be those (1) listing the current Reform UK parliamentary delegation, (2) reporting new or rumoured defections, and (3) discussing Conservative Party unrest and negotiations with Nigel Farage. Fresh coverage from February 2026 onward is pivotal.
