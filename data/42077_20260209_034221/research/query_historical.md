Analysis:
The key to forecasting Reform UK’s MP total on 7 May 2026 is estimating further defections before the party’s self-imposed cutoff.  Useful historical context therefore includes:  
• Previous instances of MPs defecting to UKIP/Brexit Party/Reform UK (numbers, timing, motives).  
• Current Conservative discontent and any publicly rumoured or hinted defectors (Feb 2026 press coverage, speeches, social-media remarks).  
• Precedent rates of floor-crossing in the final months before local elections or party deadlines.  
Searching for recent news on potential defections and broader historical data on similar defections will give an outside view on likely additional MPs.
