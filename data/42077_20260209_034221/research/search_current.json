The shadow cabinet will consist of 'experts from outside of politics,' marking a departure from traditional party structures. Unlike the Conservative Party, Reform UK currently lacks an official shadow cabinet and has only seven sitting MPs, including five former Conservatives. Robert Jenrick, former Tory immigration minister, is expected to be appointed shadow chancellor. Farage will argue that the Labour Party's instability\u2014exemplified by the Lord Mandelson scandal and the resignation of senior aide Morgan McSweeney\u2014creates an opening for Reform. He will claim that the Conservatives are irrelevant outside London and warn that voting for Kemi Badenoch risks prolonging Labour\u2019s rule. Reform has opened its parliamentary selection process to attract the 'brightest and best' candidates. Farage will also outline a vision for Britain in 2034 under a Reform government and has initiated transition talks with the Civil Service in anticipation of a leadership change. However, internal tensions may arise over the influence of new Conservative defectors versus long-standing Reform members. Kevin Hollinrake, Tory chairman, dismissed Reform as a 'one-man band' protest party, criticizing its lack of credible governance plans and asserting that the Conservatives are the only serious opposition committed to economic growth, public service reform, and national security. He warned that a vote for Reform is a gamble that could return Labour to power.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 10:57 PM\nSource:[AOL.com](https://www.aol.co.uk/articles/reform-set-plans-shadow-cabinet-225713829.html)\n\n**Government vows to \"unlock opportunities for young people across the country\" ahead of National Apprenticeship Week**\nThe UK government has announced a series of reforms to strengthen the apprenticeship system ahead of National Apprenticeship Week, aiming to 'unlock opportunities for young people across the country.' A new pilot program will introduce a university-style clearing system, re-directing 'near miss' applicants\u2014those who narrowly miss their top-choice apprenticeship\u2014to similar opportunities in their local area. This initiative, delivered in partnership with employers and Mayoral Strategic Authorities, will be supported by an online platform that consolidates apprenticeship data, including actual earnings, career progression, and employer outcomes, to help young people make informed decisions. The reforms are backed by the Growth and Skills Levy and aim to deliver 50,000 additional apprenticeships, supporting the government\u2019s goal that two-thirds of young people pursue higher-level learning or high-quality apprenticeships. The government has already achieved 353,500 apprenticeship starts in 2023/24, a 13,920 increase from the previous year. The changes are part of a broader strategy including fast-tracked course creation to meet industry demands in clean energy, digital tech, and advanced manufacturing. Centrica has announced 500 new apprenticeships by 2026, with training in low-carbon technologies at its new \u00a335 million Net Zero Training Academy in Lutterworth, opening in May. Ministers are touring the country to promote apprenticeships, with events including the TfL Apprenticeships Fair, a regional jobs fair in Bristol, and visits to the Nuclear Skills Academy and Clean Energy Jobs Fair. A first-of-its-kind partnership between the Department for Work and Pensions and the Ministry of Defence will create direct pathways from Jobcentre Plus into Armed Forces careers, highlighting transferable skills in engineering, cyber, and logistics. The government is also investing \u00a3820 million in the Youth Guarantee, creating 350,000 new training and workplace opportunities and over 360 youth hubs across Great Britain. The reforms aim to simplify the complex apprenticeship landscape, improve access, and close skills gaps by better matching young people with local employers. Councils and Mayoral Strategic Authorities will play a key role in local delivery, with the goal of ensuring no one misses out on meaningful employment and businesses gain a more organized talent pipeline. The ultimate target is for 10% of people to undertake higher technical courses or apprenticeships by 2040.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 10:30 PM\nSource:[gov.uk](https://www.gov.uk/government/news/government-vows-to-unlock-opportunities-for-young-people-across-the-country-ahead-of-national-apprenticeship-week)\n\n**Nigel Farage fires opening shots for election as he unveils plans to become PM**\nNigel Farage, leader of the Reform Party, has launched his campaign for the next UK general election by unveiling plans to become Prime Minister. Speaking in Birmingham, Farage announced the selection of parliamentary candidates starting after the May 7 local elections and the formation of a shadow cabinet composed of non-political experts. He emphasized the need for an industrial strategy to rebuild national infrastructure and security, blaming both the Conservative and Labour parties for its decline. Reform Party has consistently led opinion polls, and Farage is the bookmakers' favorite to win the next election. He has demanded access to civil service talks in case Sir Keir Starmer resigns, to prepare for government formation. Although Labour's successor could remain in office until 2029 without an election, Farage argues that a fresh mandate would be necessary, citing precedent from 2022. His speech also criticized senior Conservatives like Mel Stride, Priti Patel, and Claire Coutinho. Despite having eight MPs\u2014including four former Tories\u2014Reform lacks enough seats for a full shadow cabinet, so non-elected experts would need to be placed in safe constituencies or appointed to the House of Lords. Tory chairman Kevin Hollinrake dismissed Farage's approach as 'one-man-band protest politics' with no credible governance plan, calling it 'light on credible answers.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 09:54 PM\nSource:[The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/38161950/nigel-farage-general-election-plan-prime-minister/)\n\n**Top Starmer aide quits over appointing Epstein friend to key post**\nMorgan McSweeney, the chief of staff to UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, resigned on February 8, 2026, taking full responsibility for advising the prime minister to appoint Peter Mandelson as the UK ambassador to the US. The appointment sparked controversy due to Mandelson's known friendship with sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, despite Starmer admitting he was aware of the connection at the time. McSweeney stated in a public statement that the decision was wrong and had damaged the party, the country, and public trust in politics, emphasizing that he would 'step aside' to uphold accountability. His resignation followed a series of leadership departures since Labour\u2019s July 2024 general election victory, including the brief tenure of former chief of staff Sue Gray. The move triggered further calls for Starmer\u2019s resignation from within the Labour Party, with MPs from both the left and right factions criticizing the leadership. Labour MP Brian Leishman accused McSweeney of contributing to factionalism and urged Starmer to follow his example. Angela Rayner, seen as a potential alternative to Starmer\u2019s centrist approach, faces an ongoing tax inquiry. Right-wing MPs have floated Wes Streeting as a future leader, though he too has ties to Mandelson. Lord Blunkett urged unity, likening the party to 'ferrets in a sack' due to internal chaos. External critics, including Reform UK leader Nigel Farage and Conservative leader Kemi Badenoch, accused Starmer of avoiding personal responsibility, with Badenoch stating he 'never does' take blame. The controversy has intensified ahead of May 2026 local and devolved elections, with predictions that Starmer may not survive a leadership challenge following potential electoral setbacks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 07:07 PM\nSource:[The Age](https://www.theage.com.au/world/europe/top-starmer-aide-quits-over-appointing-epstein-friend-to-key-post-20260209-p5o0jj.html)\n\n**Reform candidate wants to 'tax people who don't have children'**\nReform UK's by-election candidate, Matt Goodwin, proposed a 'negative child benefit tax' on individuals without children in a 2023 blog post, aiming to address the UK's declining birth rates. The idea, which would tax childless people\u2014disproportionately affecting women\u2014sparked widespread criticism, with Labour's deputy leader Lucy Powell calling it 'so ludicrous' and likening it to Margaret Atwood's 'The Handmaid's Tale.' Goodwin also advocated for removing income tax for women with two or more children, creating a national day for parenthood, prioritizing British families in housing, and embedding family values in the school curriculum. The Green Party's Zack Polanski claimed the by-election is a contest between his party and Reform. Reform's spokesperson defended the proposal as a serious policy idea originally suggested by demographer Paul Morland, arguing that the Labour government has ignored the demographic crisis and that a mature debate is needed.

Speaking to The Mirror in Longsight, Manchester, Stogia emphasized that she is a local candidate with personal stakes in the area and urged Reform UK to engage directly with voters by knocking on doors. She claimed Reform UK's approach promotes division and fails to deliver for residents. Stogia also dismissed concerns about the Peter Mandelson scandal, stating that voters are focused on cost of living issues such as dental care and heating bills. She praised Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham for his immediate and active support following her selection, highlighting their strong working relationship and joint door-knocking efforts. In a direct appeal to Green voters, Stogia warned that supporting the Greens risks allowing Reform UK to win, calling their campaign tactics misleading and damaging to progressive politics.

The jurists expressed 'confident expectation' for a decision on a new referendum date, stating they would evaluate any potential appeal to the Constitutional Court if the government fails to set a date.

The site urges constituents to contact their Labour MPs with a message warning that a Labour leadership collapse would create a political vacuum, benefiting the Reform Party, which is polling at or near the national top. The message argues that Reform is not a conventional opposition party but a 'clear and present danger' to Britain\u2019s social fabric and democratic culture, as it promotes division through fear of immigration and asylum, undermines public standards, and offers economically illiterate policies that would harm ordinary households. The campaign emphasizes that a Labour fracture would not lead to renewal but a 'national own goal,' handing momentum to a right-wing force with no constructive agenda. It calls on MPs to back Starmer, demand reforms in No 10 decision-making, maintain parliamentary discipline, fix government errors, and restore seriousness to governance.

The plan, announced in February 2026, would extend the qualifying period for indefinite leave to remain from five to ten years and apply retrospectively to nearly two million migrants who entered under the post-Brexit 'Boriswave' immigration system introduced in 2021. The policy replaces automatic permanent residency rights with an 'earned settlement' system.

The cap, introduced in 2017 by then-Chancellor George Osborne, limits Child Tax Credits and Universal Credit to the first two children in a household and has been widely criticized for contributing to child poverty. The vote came despite opposition from Nigel Farage\u2019s Reform Party and Kemi Badenoch\u2019s Conservative Party. The policy will be scrapped from April 2026 and is projected to lift 450,000 to 550,000 children out of poverty by the end of the current Parliament, according to Secretary of State for Work and Pensions Pat McFadden, who called it a 'crucial step' toward tackling child poverty. Labour MPs welcomed the move as a 'down payment' but emphasized it only addresses about 10% of children in poverty. Debbie Abrahams, Chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, urged the government to go further, while Helen Hayes, Chair of the Education Committee, called for broader action on housing costs, food and energy insecurity, temporary accommodation, and systemic support for families and education. One more Commons vote is required for the bill to pass.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 07:23 PM\nSource:[Mirror](https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/politics/mps-vote-end-two-child-36665436)\n\n**Starmer Faces Rebellion over Plans to Give Gov't Housing to Migrants**\nThe UK's Labour government, led by Prime Minister Sir Kier Starmer, is facing internal rebellion from backbench MPs over plans to prioritize newly built government housing for asylum seekers, including those who entered the country illegally. The policy aims to replace the controversial Tory-era practice of hotel block bookings\u2014linked to nationwide protests and sexual assaults\u2014by relocating migrants to council housing, including refurbished buildings and former military bases. However, concerns are mounting over the 1.3 million low-income families currently on council housing waiting lists. Labour MPs such as Jonathan Brash (Hartlepool) and Graham Stringer (Blackley and Middleton South) have criticized the plan as unacceptable, arguing it undermines local needs. An anonymous Labour MP warned the policy could trigger backlash in traditional Labour 'Red Wall' constituencies, where support is shifting toward Reform UK due to anti-migration sentiment. The government is housing approximately 36,000 asylum seekers in hotels, a number expected to grow given over 41,000 illegal Channel crossings in 2025. While the government aims to end the hotel scheme by 2029, interim measures like commandeering private homes and former barracks have sparked protests, including in Crowborough, where locals fear safety and community stability. A Ministry of Housing assessment warned such housing proposals could provoke anxiety, protests, or even riots, citing the precedent of the 2024 Southport massacre. Further tensions arise from government contractors purchasing private rental properties at inflated rates, reducing housing availability and driving up rents\u2014exemplified by the Ballymena protests, where local residents reported being priced out of their own communities despite being long-term residents.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 12:03 PM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2026/02/03/starmer-faces-backlash-from-own-party-over-plans-to-give-govt-housing-to-migrants/)\n\n**The frontrunners to be Reform UK's leader in Wales | Wales Online**\nReform UK is set to announce a leader for Wales during a members-only event in Newport, with Nigel Farage expected to make the announcement. The party is polling strongly ahead of the May 7 devolved elections, though recent polls show its momentum slowing, with Plaid Cymru overtaking it by January 2026. Academics attribute the decline to shrinking Conservative voter base in Wales and the party's reliance on non-voters whose support may stall as awareness grows. Concerns about leadership, policy, candidate visibility, past scandals, and Reform UK\u2019s performance in English councils are also affecting its credibility. With less than 100 days until voting, candidates must be nominated by early April. Potential candidates include Jason O'Connell, a former independent councillor for Llantarnam who joined Reform UK in August 2024 and has been active in media; Sir Jake Berry, a former Conservative MP who defected in 2024 and praised Reform as a 'better way' than 'old Westminster politics'; Jane Dodds, a former Conservative MP and respected armed forces advocate; Laura Anne Jones, Reform UK\u2019s sole Senedd member, who faced a two-week suspension over racist WhatsApp messages and fraudulent fuel claims (rejected), and who has been under scrutiny for past sales claims related to cancer risks; and Darren Evans, the Brecon and Radnorshire Senedd member expelled from the Conservatives after criticizing the party\u2019s stance on national decline, though he has not confirmed political intentions. David Thomas, the current Reform UK Wales group leader on Torfaen Borough Council, has publicly stated he will not run in the May elections, despite being a senior party figure. His past as a rave DJ under the name Dowster and past attendance issues on the community council have also drawn attention. While several names are circulating, Jones is considered possible but unlikely due to her disciplinary history, Evans is deemed almost certainly not, and Thomas has no interest in leadership, leaving O'Connell and Berry as the most viable contenders.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 03:59 PM\nSource:[WalesOnline](https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/politics/frontrunners-reform-uks-leader-wales-33345689)\n\n**Gorton and Denton byelection: Reform could benefit from split vote on the left**\nA byelection is scheduled for February 26, 2026, in the newly formed Manchester constituency of Gorton and Denton, created by 2024 boundary changes from parts of Gorton, Denton & Reddish, and Manchester Withington. Though Labour won the seat in the 2024 general election with a 13,000 majority, early polls suggest Reform UK could win, raising concerns over Labour\u2019s vulnerability. The constituency\u2019s socio-demographic diversity\u2014combining predominantly white, working-class Tameside wards with more student- and Muslim-populated Manchester wards\u2014makes it politically complex. Labour\u2019s recent loss in the Runcorn and Helsby byelection (by just six votes despite a 14,000 majority) highlights the fragility of its position. Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage and bolstered by recent defections like Robert Jenrick and Suella Braverman, now has 8 MPs and is positioning the byelection as a 'referendum' on Keir Starmer, with a YouGov poll showing 76% of Northern voters believe the PM is doing a bad job. Reform\u2019s candidate, Matthew Goodwin, a former academic and GB News presenter, may resonate in some areas but risks alienating others with his hardline views on immigration and national identity. The Greens, though underperforming in 2024, are optimistic: their new leader Zack Polanski and candidate Hannah Spencer aim to prevent a Reform victory, citing a successful local byelection win in Derbyshire. A strong Green showing, even without winning, could hurt Labour by siphoning off left-wing voters. The outcome will test multi-party dynamics in the North and signal broader political trends ahead of the May 7, 2026, deadline for potential party defectors to Reform.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 04:55 PM\nSource:[University of Manchester John Rylands University Library](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/gorton-and-denton-byelection/)\n\n**UK Local Elections Postponed Amid Labour Reform Plan: Democracy in Question**\nOn May 7, 2026, local and regional elections in much of England will be postponed due to a planned administrative reform by the Labour government. The reform aims to abolish smaller 'District Authorities' and integrate them into larger 'County Authorities' by 2028, reducing 164 district councils and 21 regional councils to a streamlined structure. The changes are intended to save costs and strengthen regional governance, with new regional and city mayors introduced in places like Brighton. However, because the reforms cannot be implemented in time for the May elections, many councils have requested delays to avoid holding elections for bodies that will soon be abolished. Over one-third of 63 affected councils have already applied to postpone elections, allowing current officeholders to remain in place. This move could disenfranchise at least three million, and possibly over four million voters, particularly in areas like Suffolk, Sussex, Exeter, Preston, and Brighton. The issue has escalated into a major political controversy, with Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, filing a legal challenge at the Royal High Court of Justice in London, accusing Labour of undermining democracy and hiding from voters. Farage called the move a 'democratic scandal' and vowed legal action, with the case set to begin on February 19, 2026. The Conservatives also oppose the postponements, arguing they violate democratic rights. The Labour government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, defends the move as a rare exception due to administrative constraints, citing the COVID-19 pandemic as a precedent. However, the UK Electoral Commission\u2019s chief, Vijay Rangarajan, criticized the policy, warning of a conflict of interest when elected bodies decide when to hold elections, potentially undermining legitimacy. Even the Speaker of the House of Commons, Lindsay Hoyle, reportedly expressed opposition in a leaked email to a Reform UK politician.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 05:59 PM\nSource:[taz.de](https://taz.de/Kommunalwahlen-in-Grossbritannien/!6147767/)\n\n**Nigel Farage explodes as Labour axes 30 elections across UK**\nReform UK leader Nigel Farage condemned the Labour government's decision to cancel 30 local council elections scheduled for May 7, 2026, claiming that millions of citizens have been stripped of their right to vote. He accused Keir Starmer of colluding with Labour and Conservative councils and announced that Reform UK would launch a judicial review to challenge the move in the High Court. Councillors in affected areas will have their terms extended, and polling day has been postponed for county council voters in East Sussex, West Sussex, Norfolk, and Suffolk. The cancellation is part of a broader government plan to replace the two-tier local government system\u2014where district and county councils share responsibilities\u2014with single-tier 'unitary' authorities across much of England. According to Mr. Reed, elections for the new unitary councils will be held in 2027 once the new structures are finalized.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 03:23 PM\nSource:[EXPRESS](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/2161375/nigel-farage-vows-fight-denial)\n\n**Over One Million Sign Petition Demanding General Election in Britain**\nA petition on the UK Parliament's official website calling for an immediate general election has received 1,059,231 signatures, surpassing one million, signaling widespread public dissatisfaction with Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer\u2019s left-wing Labour government. The petition, which concluded its six-month campaign, argued that 'We think the majority need and want change.' This follows Labour\u2019s abandonment of a key policy to introduce mandatory identity documents after a separate petition approached three million signatures. The Cabinet Office rejected the call for an early election, stating, 'This Government was elected on a mandate of change. Our full focus is on fixing the foundations, rebuilding Britain, and restoring public confidence in government.' The petition's outcome is seen as a troubling development for Labour ahead of the critical May 2026 local elections. Nigel Farage, leader of the Reform UK party, accused Labour of undermining democracy and using 'authoritarian' tactics to delay elections, while predicting that a strong performance in May could position Reform UK to challenge for Number 10. Farage further forecasted that Starmer would be forced to call an early general election before the 2029 scheduled date due to public discontent and economic instability. Half of voters surveyed expect Starmer to be removed from office by the end of 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 02:16 PM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2026/01/14/over-one-million-sign-petition-demanding-general-election-in-britain/)\n\n**Reform will win councils in London at May local elections, says Tice as it races to recruit 1,800 candidates**\nReform UK Deputy Leader Richard Tice predicts the party will win councils in London during the May 2026 local elections, as the party races to recruit 1,800 candidates across the city\u2019s 32 boroughs in less than four months. Laila Cunningham, Reform\u2019s London mayoral candidate, is leading the recruitment effort, though Alex Wilson, a Reform London Assembly member, acknowledges the challenge is 'a big ask' given the party\u2019s still-developing local structure. The party has faced controversy over some candidates\u2019 past remarks, including Chris Parry, who claimed London-born MP David Lammy should 'go home' to the Caribbean; Parry later apologized after Nigel Farage urged him to do so, though Labour demands he be sacked. The recruitment drive mirrors the Met Police\u2019s controversial 2024 hiring scandal, which led to thousands joining without proper vetting. Reform held a rally at the Excel Centre in London\u2019s docklands, where Tice cited 'success stories' and 'momentum' from Reform-run councils to justify ambitions. Cunningham framed the elections as a 'first referendum' on Sadiq Khan\u2019s leadership, accusing Labour councillors of propping up a failing administration. She urged attendees to not only attend but to stand as candidates and campaign actively. A More in Common poll projects Reform could win eight seats in the next general election, mainly in east Outer London, while a Savanta UK survey shows Labour leading in 2028 London mayoral race despite polling at 31% in parliamentary voting intentions. The party\u2019s rapid expansion is seen as its biggest test yet, with May 2026 marking a pivotal moment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 12, 2026 06:35 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/reform-win-councils-london-may-060038313.html)\n\n**Why 2026 council election will be different**\nThe 2026 Coventry City Council election will be unprecedented, as all 54 seats will be up for grabs due to redrew electoral boundaries\u2014unlike the usual system where only a third of seats are contested each year. This 'all-out' election follows a dramatic shift in neighboring Warwickshire County Council, where Reform UK, led by teenage councillor George Finch, won a major victory in May 2025, displacing the long-dominant Conservatives. The appointment of Finch, along with subsequent national media attention and political spats involving figures like Nigel Farage, Zia Yusuf, Yvette Cooper, and Bridget Phillipson, highlighted Reform UK\u2019s disruptive strategy. Labour currently holds 39 of 54 seats in Coventry\u2014enough for control\u2014but faces growing challenges from Reform UK, which gained two councillors through defections in 2025, and from the left, including the Green Party (with two councillors) and Your Party, co-founded by MP Zarah Sultana. One Labour councillor has already left the party to join an alliance with the Greens, raising concerns about potential defections. With Reform UK openly aiming to replicate its Warwickshire success in Coventry, the 2026 election is expected to be highly disruptive, posing a significant threat to Labour\u2019s 15-year dominance. The outcome will depend heavily on whether Your Party fields candidates or backs others, a move closely watched by Labour leadership.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 04, 2026 07:19 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/why-2026-council-election-different-071934671.html)\n\n**Watch as the Left deploys 2 ugly tactics against Farage and Reform in 2026**\nReform UK began 2026 in a dominant position, maintaining its strong political standing despite increased scrutiny, according to the EXPRESS. The party, founded just seven years ago with only five MPs, has grown into a major political force, surpassing Labour in paid-up membership with over 268,000 members\u2014more than Labour\u2019s reported 250,000 under Keir Starmer. Reform has led opinion polls for 175 consecutive weeks, averaging a 10-point lead, which, if replicated in a general election, would likely result in a decisive parliamentary majority. Its grassroots strength was further demonstrated in 2025 municipal elections, where it won 677 seats and outright control of ten local authorities, while the Conservatives and Labour collectively lost nearly 900 seats.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 01, 2026 06:01 PM\nSource:[EXPRESS](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/2152505/nigel-farage-reform-2026-left)\n\n**'It's a stitch up': Anger as dozens of local elections could be cancelled**\nUp to 63 local council elections in the UK scheduled for May 2026 may be postponed for a year due to ongoing local authority reorganisation, with councils restructuring from two-tier systems into single unitary authorities. The government stated that councils with 'genuine concerns' about capacity can request a delay by January 15, 2026. This decision follows the cancellation of nine earlier elections in 2025 due to similar restructuring concerns. Of the councils eligible to delay, 26 are Labour-run, 12 are Conservative, and 10 are Liberal Democrat, with the rest having no overall control. Political leaders from across the spectrum have condemned the move: Nigel Farage (Reform UK) accused Prime Minister Keir Starmer of running a 'banana republic', calling the delay a 'stitch-up' between Labour and Conservatives to retain power. Ed Davey (Liberal Democrats) echoed this, claiming it undermines democratic legitimacy. Conservative MP James Cleverly criticized Labour for breaking a recent promise to hold elections as planned. The Electoral Commission expressed disappointment, with CEO Vijay Rangarajan stating that scheduled elections should proceed unless in exceptional circumstances, warning that extending mandates risks undermining public confidence and creating a conflict of interest. Local Government Minister Alison McGovern explained that councils have raised concerns about managing both reorganisation and resource-intensive elections for bodies soon to be abolished, and confirmed that delays will only be granted if councils demonstrate genuine capacity issues. Despite the postponements, hundreds of local elections\u2014including those for devolved parliaments in Wales and Scotland\u2014will still proceed in May 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 19, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[ITV Hub](https://www.itv.com/news/2025-12-19/its-a-stitch-up-anger-as-dozens-of-local-elections-could-be-cancelled)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
