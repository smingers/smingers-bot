of Article: \"Reform has been warned that defecting Tories will damage its brand \u2013 and the first evidence is in\"\n\n**Source:** Queen Mary University of London  \n**Date:** February 06, 2026  \n**Author:** Matthew Barnfield, Postdoctoral Research Fellow in the Department of Politics and International Relations\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Polling Data on Party Differentiation (YouGov):**\n- The proportion of people who see Reform and the Conservatives as different has fallen by 10 percentage points since September\n\n**Polling Data on Voter Opinions Post-Defections:**\n- 63% of Labour voters, 67% of Liberal Democrat voters, and 64% of Green voters had negative views of Reform before defections and haven't changed their opinions\n- Among Conservative voters, approximately half (compared to the above percentages) maintain unchanged negative opinions of Reform\n- Almost a quarter (\u224825%) of Conservative voters say they were already positive about Reform and remain so, compared to around 5% for supporters of other parties\n- Over a fifth (>20%) of Conservative voters now have a more favorable view of Reform as a result of the defections\n- Negligible numbers of other parties' supporters have become more favorable toward Reform\n- **17% of Reform supporters say the defections have made them more negative about the party** \u2013 the highest figure for any party's supporters\n\n## Key Analysis and Opinions:\n\n**From Matthew Barnfield (named academic source):**\n- There is debate about whether Conservative defectors benefit or harm Reform UK\n- Risk that Reform is tying its image to the unpopular Conservative government\n- Danger of becoming \"Tory party 2.0\"\n- Reform is unlikely to win over Labour, Liberal Democrat, or Green voters (the \"left bloc\")\n- Reform and Conservatives form the \"right bloc\" \u2013 voters rarely move between blocs, only within them\n- Reform has done especially well at attracting people who did not vote at all in 2024\n- Risk that voters who didn't vote in 2024 may disengage again if Reform looks too much like part of the traditional party system\n\n**Strategic implications identified:**\n- If Reform is to push past its recent polling plateau, it will mostly likely be by winning over more Conservative voters\n- The defections help Reform appear more viable and improve Conservative voters' opinions\n- However, the defections risk turning off existing Reform supporters and potential voters who were attracted to Reform as an alternative to the mainstream\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary

parliamentarians have joined Reform UK from the Conservatives.\n\n- **Farage's deadline:** Nigel Farage stated he would accept no further defectors from the Tories after the May elections, arguing that by then his party's strength would be so clear that additional defectors would have little value to add.\n\n## Current Reform UK MPs (mentioned in article):\n\n1. **Lee Anderson** (Ashfield) - First ever Reform MP, defected in 2024 from Conservatives after having whip removed\n2. **Nadine Dorries** - Former culture secretary, defected in September (note: article doesn't specify if she's

Conservative-origin MPs who have defected to UKIP, the Brexit Party or Reform UK since 2010  \n\n1. Defections to UKIP  \n   \u2022 Douglas Carswell \u2013 MP for Clacton; left the Conservatives and triggered a by-election won for UKIP in Aug 2014 (Guardian, 26 Mar 2017).  \n   \u2022 Mark Reckless \u2013 MP for Rochester & Strood; followed Carswell and defected at the opening of the 2014 Tory conference, also fighting and winning a by-election for UKIP (Prospect, undated article quoted in results).  \n\n2. Defections to the Brexit Party (2019)  \n   No sitting Conservative MP crossed directly to the Brexit Party while still in Parliament, but two former Tory MPs who had left Parliament did so:  \n   \u2022 Ann Widdecombe \u2013 ex Conservative MP (1997-2010); joined the Brexit Party to stand in the 2019 European elections (Telegraph, 26 Jan 2026 list).  \n   \u2022 Mark Reckless \u2013 after losing his Commons seat in 2015 he later joined Farage\u2019s Brexit Party in 2019 and led it in Wales (Telegraph, 26 Jan 2026 list).\n\n3. Defections to Reform UK (2024-26) \u2013 sitting MPs  \n   \u2022 Lee Anderson \u2013 defected Mar 2024 after losing the Tory whip (Telegraph, 26 Jan 2026).  \n   \u2022 Danny Kruger \u2013 defected Sept 2025, calling the Conservatives \u201cfinished\u201d (Telegraph, 26 Jan 2026).  \n   \u2022 Robert Jenrick \u2013 expelled by the Tories and defected 15 Jan 2026 (Guardian, 15 Jan 2026; Telegraph, 26 Jan 2026).  \n   \u2022 Andrew Rosindell \u2013 defected 19 Jan 2026 (Sky News, 19 Jan 2026).  \n   \u2022 Suella Braverman \u2013 defected 26 Jan 2026 (AP News, 26 Jan 2026; Independent, 26 Jan 2026).  \n\n4. Defections to Reform UK (2025-26) \u2013 former or defeated MPs who re-entered politics with Reform  \n   \u2022 Nadhim Zahawi \u2013 ex MP, ex Chancellor; joined 12 Jan 2026 (Independent, 26 Jan 2026).  \n   \u2022 Jake Berry, David Jones, Marco Longhi, Anne Marie Morris, Dame Andrea Jenkyns, Henry Smith, Chris Green, Ben Bradley, Brendan Clarke-Smith, Jonathan Gullis, Adam Holloway and others named in the Telegraph\u2019s roll-call of 27 former or current Tories now in Reform (Telegraph, 26 Jan 2026).  \n   (These individuals were no longer sitting MPs when they jumped, but they satisfy the request for \u201cMPs who defected \u2026 since 2010\u201d.)\n\nB. Public comments by Conservative MPs since 1 Jan 2026 praising Nigel Farage or openly hinting at a switch to Reform UK  \n\n1. Suella Braverman (still a Tory at the time) \u2013 15 Jan 2026 told journalists \u201cI like Nigel Farage \u2026 there isn\u2019t space in British politics for two conservative parties,\u201d refusing to rule out joining him (Telegraph, 15 Jan 2026). She defected 11 days later.  \n\n2. Sir John Hayes \u2013 veteran right-wing Tory MP; on 15 Jan 2026 admitted his views and Reform\u2019s overlapped \u201cto a huge degree\u201d and pressed his party to adopt Reform\u2019s \u201cnet-zero immigration\u201d policy, while saying he would \u201cstay for now\u201d (Telegraph, 15 Jan 2026).  \n\n3. Andrew Rosindell \u2013 then still Conservative \u2013 October 2025 interview resurfaced in Telegraph 15 Jan 2026 where he said his seat would \u201calmost certainly go to Reform\u201d and that he could \u201cserve alongside Mr Farage\u201d in a coalition. He defected 19 Jan 2026.  \n\n4. Mark Francois \u2013 shadow cabinet member \u2013 quoted 15 Jan 2026 as sharing Farage\u2019s Eurosceptic values; denied immediate plans to defect but was listed among those most likely to move (Telegraph, 15 Jan 2026).  \n\n5. Esther McVey \u2013 former \u201ccommon-sense\u201d minister \u2013 argued in 2025 that the Tories should let Reform win a by-election; Telegraph on 15 Jan 2026 again named her as a possible defector, reporting her line that many Tory members now hold dual membership with Reform (Telegraph, 15 Jan 2026).  \n\nCollectively those statements fulfil the brief for January 2026-dated praise of Farage or explicit flirtation with joining Reform by people who, at the moment they spoke, still held the Conservative whip.\n\nC. Observations and outstanding information gaps  \n\n\u2022 The main data missing is a definitive list of every ex-Conservative MP who has gone to UKIP or the Brexit Party between 2010-23. The sources supplied capture the two headline UKIP cases (Carswell, Reckless) but may omit any short-lived or less-publicised switches (e.g. no sources confirm if any minor figures between 2010-14 briefly crossed).  \n\n\u2022 Likewise, the Brexit Party era (spring-summer 2019) may include other former Tory MPs besides Widdecombe and Reckless who endorsed or stood for the party; no direct list appears in the results.  \n\n\u2022 No open-source article in the results lists Conservative MPs praising Farage after 26 Jan 2026 \u2013 material beyond that date might reveal new hints or endorsements.  \n\nIf total completeness is required, additional targeted searches such as \u201cConservative MP defected to UKIP 2012\u201d, \u201cBrexit Party former Tory MP 2019\u201d, or \u201cFarage praised by Tory MP February 2026\u201d would firm up any remaining edge cases. At present, however, all high-profile, well-documented defections and January 2026 Conservative praise/hints captured by national outlets are covered above.</Agent_report>\n"
