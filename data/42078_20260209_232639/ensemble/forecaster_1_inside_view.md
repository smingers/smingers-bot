## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE (warranting large shifts):**

1. **NetBlocks technical measurements (Jan 27-Feb 9)**: Multiple consistent reports confirming "heavily filtered/whitelisted" status
   - This is the resolution authority
   - Technical measurements, not opinions
   - No indication of improvement over 13-day period
   - **Impact**: Directly addresses resolution criteria

2. **Expert consensus on non-restoration pattern**: Three independent named experts (Rashidi, Madory, Alimardani) all state Iran doesn't return to normal after shutdowns
   - Rashidi: "usually we don't go back to normal"
   - Madory: "full restoration may never occur"
   - Historical pattern: 2022 Instagram/Telegram blocks remain permanent
   - **Impact**: Establishes strong historical precedent

3. **Government commitment timeline**: Iranian officials stated restrictions until "at least" March 20 (Persian New Year)
   - 39 days from Feb 9
   - Leaves only 42 days (March 20 to May 1) for potential restoration
   - Government previously backpedaled on restoration promises (Jan 23)
   - **Impact**: Explicit timeframe commitment reduces probability window

4. **Structural changes toward whitelist system**: Multiple sources confirm infrastructure being implemented
   - Filterwatch: "Classified plan" for permanent whitelist
   - NetBlocks: "Whitelist basis" consistently reported
   - Rashidi: "Infrastructure exists" for selective access
   - **Impact**: Structural changes harder to reverse than temporary blocks

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**

1. **Economic pressure ($35M/day losses)**: Minister Hashemi confirmed substantial economic damage
   - Could motivate restoration
   - However, regime prioritizes survival over economics (Interior Ministry Deputy: "national security, not economic concerns, takes priority")
   - **Impact**: Mixed - pressure exists but deprioritized

2. **Duration already exceeds 2019 precedent**: 32 days vs 11 days in 2019
   - Current situation more severe (3,117+ killed vs dozens)
   - Suggests different trajectory than 2019
   - **Impact**: Weakens analogy to 2019 "quick restoration" scenario

3. **International pressure and sanctions**: EU sanctions, US warnings, multiple countries issuing travel advisories
   - Could pressure regime
   - However, regime has shown willingness to endure isolation
   - **Impact**: Uncertain effect on internet policy

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

1. **Partial connectivity improvements**: Some networks becoming "visible internationally"
   - NetBlocks clarifies this doesn't mean restoration: "No return to usual"
   - Still "heavily filtered on whitelist basis"
   - **Impact**: Minimal - technical visibility ≠ user access

2. **Regime internal uncertainty**: Alimardani's comment that regime "doesn't know what direction they're going"
   - Speculative
   - Contradicted by Filterwatch reports of "classified plan"
   - **Impact**: Minimal - anecdotal

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: Feb 9, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = **81 days**

**Current Status**: 32 days into shutdown, NetBlocks reports "heavily filtered/whitelisted" as of Feb 9 (today)

**Timeline Breakdown**:
- Feb 9 to March 20 (Nowruz): 39 days - Government committed to restrictions
- March 20 to May 1: 42 days - Potential restoration window

**If timeframe were HALVED (to ~40 days, ending ~March 21)**:
- Would fall entirely within government's committed restriction period
- Probability would drop to ~5-8%
- Virtually no chance of restoration before government's stated deadline

**If timeframe were DOUBLED (to ~162 days, ending ~July 20)**:
- Would provide 112 days beyond March 20 deadline
- Historical precedent: 2022 restrictions lasted months without restoration
- However, longer timeframe increases chances of gradual easing
- Probability might increase to ~35-40%
- Still constrained by:
  - Expert consensus on non-restoration pattern
  - Structural whitelist implementation
  - NetBlocks' language patterns (never declares "returned to normal")

**Key Insight**: The 81-day window is problematic because 48% of it (39 days) falls within the government's explicit commitment to maintain restrictions. The remaining 52% (42 days) must account for:
1. Gradual policy shift after March 20
2. Technical implementation time
3. NetBlocks assessment period (24+ continuous hours)
4. Historical pattern of permanent restrictions

## (d) Justification

**Outside View Base Rate**: 20% (from reference class of Iranian internet shutdowns)

**Factors Supporting LOWER probability (toward 10-15%):**

1. **Resolution criteria specificity**: NetBlocks must report internet is NOT "heavily filtered/whitelisted"
   - Historical pattern: NetBlocks has NEVER made such a declaration for Iran
   - Even after 2019 "restoration," NetBlocks continued reporting filtering
   - This is a CRITICAL factor - the bar is extremely high

2. **Government explicit commitment**: 39 of 81 days (48%) explicitly committed to restrictions
   - This isn't speculation - it's stated policy
   - Government has backtracked on restoration promises before (Jan 23)
   - Reduces effective prediction window to 42 days

3. **Structural implementation of whitelist**: Multiple sources confirm infrastructure changes
   - Not just temporary blocking but systemic redesign
   - Rashidi: "Infrastructure exists"
   - Filterwatch: "Classified plan" for permanent system
   - Structural changes take time to reverse (if ever)

4. **Severity of current crisis**: "Bloodiest crackdown since 1979" (3,117+ killed)
   - Regime survival at stake
   - Far exceeds 2019 context (dozens killed)
   - Makes 2019 precedent less analogous

5. **Expert consensus**: Three independent experts all predict non-restoration
   - Not a single expert source suggests likely restoration
   - Rashidi, Madory, Alimardani all align on continued restrictions

**Factors Supporting HIGHER probability (toward 25-30%):**

1. **Economic pressure**: $35M/day losses documented
   - Businesses filing for bankruptcy
   - 650,000 unemployment increase
   - Could force pragmatic easing

2. **Time remaining**: 81 days provides substantial window
   - Longer than 2019 shutdown duration (11 days)
   - Allows for gradual policy evolution

3. **Partial connectivity visible**: Some networks becoming internationally visible
   - Could indicate technical groundwork for restoration
   - Though NetBlocks clarifies still "heavily filtered"

**Calibration Decision**:

The outside view base rate of 20% was anchored to:
- 50% base rate from reference class (1 of 2 shutdowns restored)
- Adjusted to 30% for severity
- Further adjusted to 20% for NetBlocks language patterns

**Current evidence suggests LOWER probability**:

1. **Most critical factor**: NetBlocks' resolution language has never been satisfied for Iran historically
   - Even "restored" 2019 internet was still characterized as filtered
   - This alone suggests <15% probability

2. **Government commitment**: 48% of timeframe explicitly restricted
   - Not speculation - stated policy
   - Reduces effective window dramatically

3. **Structural changes**: Whitelist infrastructure being implemented
   - Harder to reverse than temporary blocks
   - Suggests permanent shift

4. **Expert unanimity**: Zero experts predict restoration
   - All three named experts predict continued restrictions
   - No contrary expert opinion identified

**Counterbalancing**:
- Economic pressure is real but deprioritized by regime
- 42-day window after March 20 provides some possibility
- Unexpected political developments could accelerate change

**Justification for shift from 20% to 12%**:

The outside view didn't fully account for:
1. NetBlocks' historical language patterns (never declaring "not heavily filtered")
2. Government's explicit 39-day commitment (48% of timeframe)
3. Unanimity of expert opinion against restoration
4. Structural nature of whitelist implementation

These factors are sufficiently impactful because:
- Resolution criteria is extremely specific and historically unprecedented
- Government commitment eliminates half the prediction window
- Structural changes suggest permanent shift, not temporary measure
- Current crisis severity (3,117+ killed) renders 2019 precedent non-analogous

The reference class remains relevant but requires significant downward adjustment given:
- Higher resolution bar (NetBlocks must declare "not heavily filtered")
- Longer duration already (32 vs 11 days)
- More severe context (3,117 vs dozens killed)
- Explicit government timeline commitment

## Probability Calibration

**Starting point**: 20% outside view

**Adjustments**:

1. **NetBlocks language pattern** (-5%): Historical evidence shows NetBlocks never declares Iranian internet "not heavily filtered" even after "restoration"

2. **Government commitment timeline** (-3%): 48% of prediction window explicitly committed to restrictions, reducing effective window to 42 days

3. **Structural whitelist implementation** (-2%): Infrastructure changes suggest permanent shift, not temporary measure

4. **Expert unanimity** (-1%): All three named experts predict non-restoration; no contrary expert opinion

5. **Severity of crisis** (-1%): 3,117+ killed makes this fundamentally different from 2019 precedent

6. **Economic pressure** (+2%): $35M/day losses could force pragmatic easing

7. **Remaining time window** (+2%): 42 days after March 20 provides some possibility for change

**Calibrated probability**: 20% - 12% (adjustments) + 4% (counterbalancing) = **12%**

**Consistency check**: "12 out of 100 times, NetBlocks reports Iran's internet is not heavily filtered/whitelisted for 24+ continuous hours before May 1, 2026"
- This feels appropriate given:
  - Government commitment through 48% of timeframe
  - NetBlocks has never made such declaration historically
  - Expert consensus against restoration
  - Structural changes toward permanent whitelist

**Alternative framing**: 88% probability that internet remains "heavily filtered/whitelisted" through May 1
- Aligns with:
  - Government stated policy through March 20
  - Expert predictions
  - Historical patterns
  - Current trajectory (32 days, no improvement)

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will NetBlocks report Iran's internet is NOT "heavily filtered/whitelisted" for 24+ continuous hours before May 1, 2026 (81 days)?
   ✓ Analysis aligns with resolution criteria

2. **Outside view base rate**: 20% from Iranian shutdown reference class
   ✓ Final prediction (12%) is rooted to this base rate with justified adjustments for current circumstances being more severe

3. **Consistency check**: "12 out of 100 times, NetBlocks reports Iran's internet is not heavily filtered/whitelisted for 24+ continuous hours before May 1, 2026."
   ✓ Aligned with justification: government commitment through 48% of timeframe, NetBlocks never made such declaration historically, expert consensus against restoration

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - NetBlocks reports (Jan 27-Feb 9): Consistently "heavily filtered/whitelisted," no improvement trend
   - Government commitment: Restrictions until "at least" March 20 (39 of 81 days)
   - Expert consensus: Rashidi, Madory, Alimardani all predict non-restoration pattern
   ✓ All factually verified from identifiable sources

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Unexpected regime collapse or major political transition could rapidly eliminate internet controls. This would shift probability to 30-40%. However, even in 2022 protests (also severe), restrictions became permanent rather than lifted.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Current status is "heavily filtered/whitelisted" for 32 days with no improvement trend. Government committed to maintaining through March 20 (39 more days). Status quo continuation = NO resolution. Given low volatility of government policy and structural implementation, slight nudge toward status quo is appropriate (already reflected in 12% probability).
