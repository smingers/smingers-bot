- Nov 2019: Near-total blackout Nov 16-21 (~5 days), largely restored by Nov 27 (11 days total)
- Sep-Oct 2022: Nightly mobile cuts starting Sep 21, no clear end date documented
- Critical finding: NetBlocks has NEVER stated internet "returned to normal" after Iranian shutdowns
- Pattern: "Every time we have an internet shutdown in Iran, usually we don't go back to normal"

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Iranian internet shutdowns returning to "not heavily filtered" status:**
   - 2019: ~11 days from shutdown to restoration
   - 2022: No clear restoration; blocks remained indefinitely
   - Current (2026): 32 days since Jan 8 shutdown, still heavily filtered as of Feb 9
   - Suitability: HIGH - Most directly relevant

2. **Duration of authoritarian internet restrictions during major protests:**
   - Kashmir (India): Extended restrictions lasting months
   - Myanmar: Ongoing restrictions since 2021 coup
   - Ethiopia: Various shutdowns lasting weeks to months
   - Suitability: MODERATE - Different political contexts

3. **Iranian government promises vs. actual restoration:**
   - Jan 15 statement: No access until "at least" March (Persian New Year = March 20)
   - Pattern: Government statements unreliable, often extended
   - Suitability: HIGH - Directly relevant to timeframe

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** Iranian internet shutdown restoration patterns, particularly the 2019 precedent combined with government statements about the 2026 situation.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window:** Feb 9, 2026 to May 1, 2026 = 81 days remaining

**Current Status (as of Feb 9):**
- Shutdown began Jan 8, 2026
- 32 days have elapsed since shutdown
- NetBlocks consistently reports "heavily filtered/whitelisted" status through Feb 6
- Government indicated restrictions until "at least" March 20 (39 days from Feb 9)

**Historical Patterns:**

*2019 Shutdown:*
- Duration: ~11 days to substantial restoration
- Context: Fuel price protests, less severe than 2026
- Outcome: Relatively quick restoration

*2022 Disruptions:*
- Duration: Months of restrictions, no clear "normal" restoration
- Context: Women, Life, Freedom protests
- Outcome: Permanent blocks on Instagram/WhatsApp, never fully restored

*2026 Current Situation:*
- Already 32 days (3x longer than 2019)
- Described as "bloodiest crackdown since 1979" (3,117+ killed)
- Government explicitly stated restrictions until "at least" March 20
- NetBlocks: Whitelist system being implemented, not just temporary shutdown
- Expert consensus: "Usually we don't go back to normal"

**Critical Differences from 2019:**
1. Much longer duration already (32 vs 11 days)
2. Far more violent (3,117 vs dozens killed)
3. Explicit government commitment to restrictions through March
4. Infrastructure changes toward permanent whitelisting
5. Economic crisis deeper, regime more threatened

## (d) Justification

The question asks whether Iran's internet will NOT be "heavily filtered/whitelisted" for more than 24 continuous hours before May 1, 2026.

**Factors Supporting "Yes" (restoration):**
- Economic pressure ($36M/day losses)
- Historical precedent: 2019 restored in 11 days
- 81 days remaining provides substantial time
- Some partial connectivity already visible

**Factors Supporting "No" (continued filtering):**
- Government explicitly stated restrictions until "at least" March 20 (39 days away)
- NetBlocks consistently reports "heavily filtered/whitelisted" as of latest reports (Feb 6)
- Expert consensus: Iran doesn't return to "normal" after shutdowns
- 2022 precedent: Restrictions became permanent
- Current crisis far more severe than 2019 (3,117+ killed vs dozens)
- Infrastructure changes toward permanent whitelist system
- Regime survival at stake (described as existential threat)
- Pattern: Each shutdown results in more permanent restrictions
- NetBlocks has NEVER declared Iranian internet "returned to normal" after any shutdown

**Key Insight:** The question's resolution criteria require NetBlocks to report the internet is NOT "heavily filtered/whitelisted." Based on the agent report, NetBlocks has never made such a declaration for Iran, even after the 2019 shutdown that was considered "restored." The organization's language consistently describes ongoing filtering even when connectivity improves.

**Timeline Analysis:**
- Government commitment: Restrictions through at least March 20 (39 days from now)
- That leaves only 42 days (March 20 to May 1) for restoration
- Given 32 days have passed with no movement toward lifting whitelist, and government has explicitly committed to maintaining restrictions for another 39 days, the probability of 24+ hours of non-filtered access before May 1 is low

**Most Likely Scenario:** Gradual improvement in connectivity through March-April, but continued whitelist/filtering that NetBlocks continues to characterize as "heavily filtered," similar to the pattern after 2022.

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring Points:**
1. Government statement: Restrictions until "at least" March 20 = explicit commitment to 39 more days of filtering
2. Historical pattern: 2022 never restored, 2019 restored but in less severe context
3. NetBlocks language: Never declares Iran "returned to normal"
4. Current trajectory: 32 days in, still "heavily filtered" per all sources

**Base Rate Considerations:**
- Iranian shutdowns returning to "not heavily filtered": 1 out of 2 recent cases (2019 yes, 2022 no) = 50% base rate
- However, 2026 situation more similar to 2022 (severe crackdown) than 2019
- Adjusted base rate given severity: ~30%

**Calibration Factors:**
1. Time remaining (81 days) vs government commitment (39 days minimum filtering) = 48% of timeframe explicitly committed to filtering
2. Expert consensus that Iran doesn't return to normal = reduces probability
3. NetBlocks' historical language patterns = even if connectivity improves, may still be characterized as "heavily filtered"
4. Severity of current crisis = regime unlikely to risk full restoration

**Probability Calculation:**
- Baseline from government commitment: 39/81 days = 48% of timeframe explicitly filtered
- Remaining 42 days for potential restoration
- Probability of restoration in those 42 days given:
  - Infrastructure changes toward permanent whitelist
  - Expert predictions of no return to normal
  - NetBlocks' language patterns
  - Severity of crisis

**Conservative estimate:** Even if some improvement occurs, NetBlocks likely to continue characterizing as "heavily filtered" based on historical patterns. The resolution criterion is strict: NetBlocks must report it is NOT "heavily filtered/whitelisted."

Given:
- Explicit government commitment through March 20
- 32 days already elapsed with no improvement
- Historical pattern of permanent restrictions after severe crackdowns
- NetBlocks' consistent language of ongoing filtering
- Expert consensus against restoration

The probability of 24+ continuous hours of non-filtered internet (as NetBlocks would characterize it) before May 1 is low.

**Calibrated estimate:** 18-22% range, centering on 20%
