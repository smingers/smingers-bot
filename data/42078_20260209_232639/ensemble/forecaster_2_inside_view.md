Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary NetBlocks Reports (Jan 27-30, 2026):**
NetBlocks is the authoritative source for this question's resolution criteria. Multiple reports confirm Iran's internet remains "heavily filtered/whitelisted" as of Jan 30, 2026 (22 days into shutdown). NetBlocks is a highly credible internet monitoring organization with transparent methodology. **Factual assessment, not opinion.**

**Iran International (Jan 27, 2026):**
Reports NetBlocks findings at day 20; confirms whitelist access for state media/businesses only. Cites EU diplomat statements on sanctions. **High credibility; factual reporting with named sources.**

**The National (Feb 6, 2026):**
Most recent assessment - confirms internet "remains heavily filtered and largely blocked" per NetBlocks and technology experts. Iranian Deputy Minister Akbari acknowledges access hasn't returned to pre-protest levels but denies whitelisting (contradicted by NetBlocks data). **Recent, credible; government denial is opinion contradicted by technical evidence.**

**CNN (Jan 30, 2026):**
Expert opinions from Amir Rashidi (Miaan Group), Doug Madory (Kentik), Mahsa Alimardani (Witness). **Rashidi's key opinion:** "Every time we have an internet shutdown in Iran, usually we don't go back to normal" and infrastructure exists for permanent whitelisting. **Madory's observation:** Traffic patterns "very jagged," possibly new filtering system. **Strong evidence from identifiable experts with technical expertise.**

**BBC (Jan 28, 2026):**
Confirms 5,925+ deaths (HRANA), $35M daily economic losses. **Doug Madory quote:** "Looking at web traffic data, the patterns suggest a full restoration of internet access in Iran may never occur." **Amir Rashidi:** Evidence points to "only certain approved people" having access. **Strong evidence from same experts; concerning long-term prognosis.**

**Jerusalem Post (Jan 23, 2026):**
Reports early restoration claims contradicted by NetBlocks warnings of "heavily filtered" services and "false traffic" generation attempts. **Moderate evidence; shows government unreliability on promises.**

**RFE/RL (Feb 9, 2026 - TODAY):**
Most current source available. NetBlocks (Jan 30) reported internet "heavily filtered and restricted" with whitelist access and intermittent disconnections. Notes no direct US-Iran talks currently planned despite diplomatic signals. **Current factual reporting.**

**AskNews Articles (Feb 6-9, 2026):**
Multiple sources confirm:
- Filterwatch reports Iran developing "permanent" whitelist system (Jan 17-19 sources)
- US urging citizens to leave Iran citing "continued government restrictions on access to mobile and fixed-line networks" (Feb 6)
- Wired (Feb 9): "Iran's Digital Surveillance Machine Is Almost Complete"
- Economic damage: IRR100 trillion ($196M) total losses per Ministry of Communications
**Strong convergent evidence from multiple independent sources about structural shift toward permanent filtering.**

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (Large Shifts):**
1. **NetBlocks continuous reporting (Jan 27-30):** Primary resolution authority confirms "heavily filtered/whitelisted" status persists 22+ days into shutdown. Multiple independent technical measurements (Kentik, NetBlocks) show same pattern. **Direct evidence for current state.**

2. **Expert consensus on structural change:** Amir Rashidi, Doug Madory, Mahsa Alimardani (all identifiable experts with technical credentials) independently assess this shutdown differs from 2019/2022. Rashidi: "infrastructure exists" for permanent whitelisting. Madory: "full restoration...may never occur." **Strong causal mechanism: regime installing new technical architecture.**

3. **Filterwatch reports (multiple sources, Jan 17-19):** Iran developing classified plan for permanent whitelist system. Corroborated by Iranian state media signals and government spokesman statements about no return to "normal" after 2026. **Structural/institutional factor indicating regime intent.**

4. **Economic tolerance:** Despite $35M daily losses and business sector complaints, shutdown continues 32+ days (vs. 6 days in 2019, 7 days in 2022). Regime accepting higher economic cost suggests different political calculation. **Historical deviation from reference class.**

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Official timeline slippage:** Iranian officials initially promised restoration "by end of week" (Jan 23), then "by Nowruz" (March 20), now indefinite. Pattern shows unreliability but also suggests regime flexibility under pressure. **Moderate evidence for eventual partial restoration, but timing uncertain.**

2. **Starlink/circumvention efforts:** Reports of 50,000-11M Starlink connections and Conduit app usage show population resistance. However, government crackdown on terminals and technical jamming capability demonstrated. **Moderate evidence that complete isolation difficult but regime has tools to maintain heavy filtering.**

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Diplomatic talks in Oman:** US-Iran nuclear negotiations described as "productive." Could create pressure for internet restoration as confidence-building measure, but no direct linkage established. **Speculative connection.**

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 82 days remaining (Feb 9 → May 1, 2026)

**Current elapsed time:** 32 days since Jan 8 shutdown

**Critical observation:** At 32 days, this is already 5x longer than 2019 (6 days) and 4.5x longer than 2022 (7 days) Iranian shutdowns. In reference class, 70% of reversions occurred within 8 weeks (56 days). We're at day 32 with 82 days remaining = 114 total days possible.

**If timeframe halved (41 days remaining):** Would significantly decrease probability. Historical data shows reversions cluster in weeks 2-8; if we're already at week 4.5 with only 6 more weeks, and expert consensus suggests structural change, probability would drop to ~30-35%.

**If timeframe doubled (164 days remaining, extending to August 2026):** Would moderately increase probability to ~45-50%. More time allows for: (1) economic pressure to compound, (2) diplomatic breakthroughs, (3) regime miscalculation correction. However, experts suggest permanent architecture being installed, so even extended time may not help.

**Key temporal factor:** March 20 (Nowruz) is 39 days away. This is the regime's stated earliest restoration date. If internet remains heavily filtered past Nowruz, historical patterns suggest very low probability of restoration by May 1.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view base rate: 55%** (60% reference class success rate, adjusted -5pp for severity)

**Factors warranting DOWNWARD adjustment:**

1. **Duration anomaly:** 32 days already exceeds all Iranian precedents by 4-5x. In reference class, only Myanmar (ongoing 3+ years), Ethiopia-Tigray (18+ months), and Kashmir (7+ months) exceeded 30 days. These cases involved civil war or military rule - more extreme than Iran, but the duration pattern is concerning.

2. **Expert consensus on structural change:** Three independent technical experts (Rashidi, Madory, Alimardani) assess this as qualitatively different from 2019/2022. Rashidi explicitly states "infrastructure exists" for permanent whitelisting and regime is "rapidly moving in that direction." This suggests the reference class (temporary protest shutdowns) may not apply.

3. **Regime statements:** Iranian officials and state media signaling no return to "normal" after 2026 (per Filterwatch). While regime statements are often unreliable, the consistency across multiple spokespersons and the technical preparations observed suggest genuine intent.

4. **Economic tolerance threshold exceeded:** Regime accepting $35M daily losses for 32+ days = $1.1B+ total (vs. $1.5B for entire 2019 shutdown). This suggests political survival calculations override economic concerns, weakening the "business pressure" reversion mechanism that worked in 2019/2022.

5. **Death toll magnitude:** 3,117-5,925 confirmed deaths (possibly higher) represents "bloodiest crackdown since 1979 Revolution." Regime has crossed a threshold that makes backing down politically costly. Maintaining information control becomes existential.

**Factors warranting UPWARD adjustment:**

1. **82 days remaining:** Still substantial time for economic/diplomatic pressure to force change. Nowruz (March 20) remains plausible inflection point.

2. **Technical challenges:** Even Myanmar and China haven't achieved perfect whitelisting. Reports of Starlink usage and "jagged" traffic patterns suggest regime struggling with implementation.

3. **International pressure:** US-Iran talks, EU sanctions, global attention could create face-saving path for partial restoration.

**Net assessment:** Downward factors (structural change, duration, expert consensus, regime intent) substantially outweigh upward factors (time remaining, technical difficulty). The current situation appears to be a qualitative shift from the reference class, not just a longer version of 2019/2022.

**Magnitude of shift:** The evidence suggests moving from 55% (outside view) to approximately 25-30% (inside view). This represents a ~25-30 percentage point decrease, justified by:
- Multiple strong evidence sources pointing same direction
- Expert consensus that reference class no longer applies
- Structural/institutional changes (new filtering architecture)
- Historical duration already 4-5x longer than precedents

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view: 55%

**Adjustments:**
- Duration anomaly (32 days vs. 6-7 days historical): -10pp
- Expert consensus on permanent architecture: -10pp
- Regime statements/intent signals: -5pp
- Economic tolerance exceeded: -5pp
- Time remaining (82 days) allows some possibility: +5pp
- Technical implementation challenges: +3pp

**Calibrated inside view: 28%**

This reflects:
- 28 out of 100 similar situations would see heavy filtering lifted before May 1
- 72 out of 100 would maintain whitelist/heavy filtering through May 1
- Accounts for small but real possibility of: (1) Nowruz restoration as face-saving, (2) diplomatic breakthrough forcing change, (3) regime miscalculation/technical failure

**Confidence check:** Moving from 55% to 28% is a substantial shift (-27pp) but justified by convergent strong evidence that this case differs fundamentally from reference class. The shift is not to extreme confidence (e.g., 5% or 95%) because:
- 82 days is meaningful time
- Authoritarian regimes can miscalculate
- Economic pressure could still force partial restoration
- NetBlocks criteria ("not heavily filtered for most users for >24 hours") sets a low bar - even brief restoration counts

---

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will NetBlocks report Iran's internet is NOT heavily filtered/whitelisted for most users, continuously for >24 hours, before May 1, 2026? (82 days remaining)

2. **Base rate:** Outside view established 55% based on 60% reference class (authoritarian protest shutdowns reverting within 3 months), adjusted -5pp for Iranian severity.

3. **Consistency:** "28 out of 100 times, NetBlocks reports Iran's internet is not heavily filtered/whitelisted for most users for >24 hours before May 1, 2026." This aligns with my assessment that regime is implementing structural change toward permanent whitelisting, but leaves room for diplomatic/economic pressure or regime miscalculation.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - NetBlocks confirms "heavily filtered/whitelisted" status persists at day 22 (Jan 30) - factually valid, primary source
   - Three independent experts (Rashidi, Madory, Alimardani) assess structural shift to permanent filtering - factually valid, credible experts
   - Duration (32 days) already 4-5x longer than 2019/2022 Iranian precedents - factually valid, objective measurement
   - Filterwatch reports regime developing classified permanent whitelist plan - factually valid, corroborated by multiple sources
   - Regime accepting $1.1B+ economic losses vs. backing down - factually valid, demonstrates different political calculation

5. **Blind spot:** Diplomatic breakthrough scenario. If US-Iran nuclear talks produce surprise agreement requiring internet restoration as confidence-building measure, or if regime faces elite fracture forcing policy reversal, my 28% would be too low. This could shift probability to 45-50%.

6. **Status quo:** Current status quo is "heavily filtered/whitelisted" per NetBlocks. If this continues unchanged through May 1, question resolves NO. Given 32 days of stable filtering, low volatility, and expert assessment of structural change, status quo continuation is most likely outcome. This supports my 28% (closer to NO than YES).

Probability: 28%
