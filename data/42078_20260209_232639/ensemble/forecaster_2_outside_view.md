Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**AP News articles (Dec 29, 2025 - Jan 2, 2026):**
- High-quality mainstream news source documenting the onset of protests
- Factual: Currency collapse to 1.42M rials/$, protests in 100+ locations across 22 provinces, 8 deaths by Jan 2
- Expert opinion: Naysan Rafati (International Crisis Group) warned of escalation risks
- These predate the Jan 8 internet shutdown

- Expert opinions: NetBlocks (whitelisting emerging), Filterbaan (absolute blockage), government spokeswoman (no international access until March)
- Key fact: Ahmad Nirumand (Digital Transformation Commission) stated no plans to restore foreign messenger apps

**The National (Feb 6, 2026):**
- Recent article (3 days before question opening)
- Factual: Blackout technically ended but heavily filtered
- NetBlocks quote: "Whitelisting and intermittent connectivity continue"
- Government position: Deputy Minister Akbari acknowledged internet hasn't returned to pre-protest levels but denied whitelisting allegations as "baseless"
- This is the most recent assessment available

**Iran International (Jan 20, 2026):**
- Opposition-aligned source, less reliable for unbiased reporting
- NetBlocks cited: "traffic on select platforms points to emergent strategy of whitelisting"
- Contains unverified witness accounts (Bardia) with dramatic death toll claims

**CNN (Jan 30, 2026):**
- High-quality mainstream source
- Factual: Partial restoration after ~20 days, only ~50,000 Starlink terminals in country of 92M
- Expert opinions: Amir Rashidi (infrastructure for whitelisting exists, won't return to normal), Doug Madory (traffic "very jagged"), Mahsa Alimardani (regime doesn't know its own direction)
- NetBlocks (Jan 29): "Most ordinary users still face heavy filtering and intermittent service under a whitelist system"

**The Guardian (Jan 28, 2026):**
- High-quality source
- Factual: Traffic reached ~60% of pre-shutdown levels, costing $36M/day
- Doug Madory: "definitely not restored to pre-8 January levels," "Every day is different"
- Filterwatch: Some services available province-by-province but unstable

**RFE/RL Interview (Jan 29, 2026):**
- Mahsa Alimardani interview
- NetBlocks (Jan 28): "most regular Internet users still face heavy filtering and only intermittent service under a whitelist system"
- Expert assessment: Connectivity "comes and goes," not consistent

**Agent Report on Historical Precedents:**
- Well-researched analysis of 2019 and 2022 shutdowns
- Key finding: NetBlocks has NEVER stated internet "returned to normal" after Iranian shutdowns
- 2019: Near-total blackout Nov 16-21 (~5 days), phased reconnection complete by Nov 27 (~11 days total)
- 2022: Nightly mobile cuts from Sep 21, no clear end-date documented; Instagram/WhatsApp blocks remained indefinitely
- Critical insight: "Every time we have an internet shutdown in Iran, usually we don't go back to normal"

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Iranian internet shutdowns (2019, 2022):** Most directly relevant
   - 2019: Took ~11 days to restore most connectivity, but never fully "normal"
   - 2022: Partial restrictions lasted months, platform blocks remained indefinitely
   - Neither instance saw NetBlocks declare return to non-filtered status

2. **Global internet shutdowns in authoritarian contexts:** Less relevant
   - Kashmir, Myanmar had longer shutdowns but different political contexts
   - Iran's technical infrastructure and political will are unique

3. **Current 2026 shutdown trajectory:** Most relevant for near-term prediction
   - Started Jan 8, 2026
   - As of Feb 6 (29 days later): Still "heavily filtered/whitelisted" per NetBlocks
   - Government statements indicate no restoration until at least March 20 (Nowruz)

**Most suitable reference class:** The current 2026 shutdown trajectory combined with historical Iranian shutdown patterns, weighted heavily toward expert assessments from NetBlocks (the resolution source).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** Feb 9, 2026 → May 1, 2026 = 81 days remaining

**Current status (as of Feb 6-9, 2026):**
- 29-32 days into shutdown
- NetBlocks assessment: "heavily filtered/whitelisted" continues
- Government position: Denies whitelisting but acknowledges not back to normal
- Deputy Minister: Restrictions "beyond control of Ministry of Communications"

**Historical patterns:**
- 2019: 11 days to mostly restore, but never fully normal
- 2022: Months of restrictions, some permanent
- Current shutdown already 3x longer than 2019's acute phase

**Key dates ahead:**
- March 20, 2026 (Nowruz/Iranian New Year): Government indicated possible restoration point
- May 1, 2026: Question resolution date

**Critical observation:** The question requires NetBlocks to report internet is NOT "heavily filtered/whitelisted" for >24 hours. As of Feb 6, NetBlocks explicitly stated it IS "heavily filtered/whitelisted." The burden is on demonstrating a complete reversal of this status.

## (d) Justification

**Factors favoring "Yes" (internet NOT heavily filtered before May 1):**

1. **Economic pressure:** $36M/day losses creating internal pressure
2. **Time available:** 81 days is substantial; 2019 shutdown resolved in 11 days
3. **Partial restoration trend:** Traffic at ~60% by late January suggests gradual easing
4. **Nowruz timeline:** Government indicated March 20 as potential restoration point, which is before May 1

**Factors favoring "No" (internet remains heavily filtered until May 1):**

1. **NetBlocks' explicit current assessment (Feb 6):** "heavily filtered/whitelisted" continues
2. **Government infrastructure investment:** Ahmad Nirumand stated no plans to restore foreign messenger apps; infrastructure for permanent whitelisting exists
3. **Historical precedent:** NetBlocks has NEVER declared Iranian internet "returned to normal" after any shutdown
4. **Expert consensus:** Amir Rashidi: "Every time we have an internet shutdown in Iran, usually we don't go back to normal"; Mahsa Alimardani: regime doesn't know its own direction
5. **Political context:** 3,117+ deaths make this "bloodiest crackdown since 1979 Revolution" - regime has maximum incentive to maintain control
6. **Government statements:** Deputy Minister acknowledged internet not back to pre-protest levels; government spokesperson said no international access until "at least" March 20 (hedging language)
7. **Technical reality:** Even when traffic increased, Doug Madory noted "jagged" patterns suggesting ongoing throttling/filtering
8. **2022 precedent:** Platform blocks (Instagram, WhatsApp) remained indefinitely after protests subsided
9. **Whitelisting as new normal:** Multiple experts indicate Iran is transitioning to permanent whitelisting model, not temporary measure

**Critical resolution criterion:** The question requires NetBlocks to report internet is NOT "heavily filtered/whitelisted" for >24 continuous hours. This is a high bar requiring NetBlocks to affirmatively declare the filtering has ended, not merely that some connectivity exists.

Outside view calibration:

**Base rates to consider:**

1. **NetBlocks declaring Iranian internet "not heavily filtered" after a shutdown:** 0/2 historical instances (2019, 2022)
2. **Current trajectory:** 32 days in, still explicitly "heavily filtered/whitelisted" per NetBlocks
3. **Time remaining:** 81 days is theoretically sufficient, but historical pattern shows degraded service becomes permanent

**Tethering to sources:**

- Government indicated "at least March 20" for potential restoration (40 days from now, 41 days before May 1 deadline)
- Even if partial restoration occurs by March 20, historical precedent suggests it will remain filtered
- The question's specific wording requires NetBlocks to affirmatively report it's NOT heavily filtered - a high evidentiary bar

**Probability reasoning:**

- If government restores by March 20 AND removes heavy filtering: Would need NetBlocks to confirm within 41-day window (March 20-May 1)
- Probability government restores by March 20: ~40% (they indicated "at least" March 20, hedging language)
- Probability restoration is NOT heavily filtered: ~15% (given infrastructure for whitelisting exists and expert consensus it becomes permanent)
- Probability NetBlocks confirms within window: ~80% (they monitor actively)
- Combined: 0.40 × 0.15 × 0.80 = 4.8%

**Alternative scenario:** Earlier restoration before March 20
- Probability: ~10% (economic pressure could force earlier action)
- Probability it's not heavily filtered: ~10% (would be rushed, likely still filtered)
- Combined: 0.10 × 0.10 × 0.80 = 0.8%

**Total base estimate:** ~5-6%

**Adjustments for unexpected outcomes:**
- Domain (authoritarian internet control): Low rate of positive surprises; regimes typically maintain or increase control
- Iran specifically: Pattern of permanent degradation after each shutdown
- Current severity: Bloodiest crackdown since 1979 suggests regime will maintain maximum control

**Final calibration:** The 5-6% estimate seems appropriate. The question has a very specific resolution criterion (NetBlocks reporting NOT heavily filtered for >24 hours), and all evidence points toward permanent whitelisting becoming the new normal. Even optimistic scenarios (restoration by March 20) face the hurdle that NetBlocks has never declared Iranian internet "not heavily filtered" after any previous shutdown.
