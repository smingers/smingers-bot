Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / resolution focus  
This resolves **Yes** if **NetBlocks** reports that, for **most users in Iran**, internet access is **not “heavily filtered/whitelisted”** for a **continuous >24 hours** at any time **before May 1, 2026 (IRST)**.

(a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; date)
- NetBlocks Mastodon updates (Jan 27 & Jan 30, 2026; also cited via RFE/RL Feb 9): High-relevance, effectively the *resolution authority*. Factual network-observation claims: “web still heavily filtered on a whitelist basis,” “most ordinary users still face heavy filtering… under a whitelist system.”
- BBC (Jan 28, 2026): High-quality mainstream reporting. Mix of facts (intermittent connectivity, tiered access reports, economic losses) and attributed expert interpretation (Kentik, Rashidi). Supports that “returning” ≠ normal; describes whitelisting-like tiering.
- CNN (Jan 30, 2026): High-quality mainstream reporting; includes identifiable experts (Rashidi, Madory, Alimardani) plus NetBlocks statement. Key expert opinion: shutdowns in Iran often do not return to normal; whitelisting infrastructure exists.
- The National (Feb 6, 2026): Recent, reputable regional outlet. Reports the blackout “technically ended” but connectivity remains heavily filtered; includes gov denial and partial acknowledgment.
- RFE/RL live blog (Feb 9, 2026): Credible outlet; repeats NetBlocks characterization (“heavily filtered and restricted” on whitelist). Mainly secondary summary but consistent with NetBlocks.
- Wired (Feb 9, 2026): High-quality tech journalism; focuses on structural surveillance/censorship capacity. Not directly dispositive for NetBlocks wording, but supports the plausibility of durable controls.
- bne IntelliNews (Feb 9, 2026): Business-focused outlet; emphasizes economic damage magnitude. Relevant as a pressure-to-relax mechanism, but not direct evidence of policy reversal.
- Geo.fr / RTBF (Feb 9, 2026): Secondary/feature-style discussions; useful context on circumvention/mesh networks and global shutdown trends; limited direct forecasting signal for NetBlocks’ future classification.
- Jerusalem Post (Jan 23, 2026): Mixed reliability; still useful mainly where it quotes NetBlocks and timeline claims; otherwise treat with caution.
- Iran International (Jan 27, 2026): Opposition-aligned; potential bias. Useful primarily for relaying NetBlocks/AFP-style items, not for unsupported claims.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted toward resolution criteria)
Strong evidence (pushes toward “No / remains heavily filtered”):
- Resolution-source continuity: NetBlocks repeatedly (late Jan; echoed Feb 6/9 reporting) describes Iran as **still “heavily filtered/whitelisted” for ordinary users**. Multiple independent media cite the same NetBlocks characterization.  
- Structural/political mechanism: Multiple named experts (Rashidi; Kentik’s Madory) describe patterns consistent with **testing/operating a new restrictive filtering regime** and warn Iran “usually [doesn’t] go back to normal.” This aligns with Iran’s longstanding censorship trajectory and incentives after a lethal crackdown.
- Status quo persistence: By Feb 9, the situation has lasted ~1 month since Jan 8, moving from blackout to **tiered/whitelist** rather than normalization—suggesting institutionalization, not temporary disturbance.

Moderate evidence (small-to-moderate push toward “Yes / could ease”):
- Economic pressure is material (reported tens of millions USD/day losses; large drops in economic activity). This creates incentive to restore broader connectivity.
- Government signaling about timelines (reporting suggesting “until at least Nowruz / March 20”) implies *some* possibility of loosening before May—though “at least” is conspicuously non-committal and consistent with “restore but keep filtered.”

Weak evidence (minimal directional impact on NetBlocks’ eventual classification):
- Circumvention improvements (Conduit, mesh networks, Starlink smuggling). These help some users, but **do not imply NetBlocks will judge access not heavily filtered for most users**.
- Diplomatic talks/mediation reports: could indirectly reduce unrest, but translating that into a verified NetBlocks “not heavily filtered” status by May is speculative.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time remaining: ~81 days (Feb 9 → May 1, 2026 IRST).  
- If the timeframe were halved (~40 days; to late March/Nowruz): I’d expect an even lower chance of NetBlocks declaring “not heavily filtered,” because near-term moves likely look like *managed restoration* (tiered access), not broad normalization.  
- If doubled (~160 days; into mid/late 2026): probability would rise meaningfully because regimes sometimes relax controls after stability returns; I’d expect something like low-teens (%) over that longer horizon—still not high given the apparent strategic shift toward whitelisting.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from the 6% outside view)
Outside view base rate was ~6%, anchored on: (i) NetBlocks never clearly declaring a “back to normal” after prior Iran shutdowns; (ii) current explicit NetBlocks “heavily filtered/whitelist” status; (iii) strong incentives to preserve control after mass unrest.

Inside view update: I do **not** see new, time-proximate evidence (as of Feb 9) indicating an imminent dismantling of whitelisting for *most users*. Recent sources reinforce persistence and institutional capacity (Wired) more than they support normalization. Economic and diplomatic pressures are real, but the most likely regime response is “more connectivity, still filtered,” which would **not** satisfy the NetBlocks-based resolution criterion.

So I keep the forecast close to the outside view, with only a slight upward nudge for the possibility that post-Nowruz stabilization + economic strain leads to a broad-enough rollback that NetBlocks explicitly characterizes as not heavily filtered for most users for >24h.

Probability calibration
- Status quo if nothing changes: NetBlocks continues to describe access as heavily filtered/whitelisted → resolves **No**.
- Key “Yes” pathways (need *both* policy change and NetBlocks confirmation):
  1) Regime restores broad international access (not tiered) after unrest subsides (e.g., around/after Nowruz) and NetBlocks judges it no longer “heavily filtered/whitelisted” for most users.  
  2) Political shock (elite split, major concessions, partial regime collapse) forces normalization fast enough that NetBlocks reports it.
- Key “No” pathways (numerous, and consistent with current trend):
  1) Partial restoration continues but remains whitelist/tiered.  
  2) Rolling throttling/intermittency persists; even if “better,” still “heavily filtered.”  
  3) Another security trigger leads to renewed shutdowns.

Net effect: remain in high-single-digits at most.

Checklist:
1. Criteria alignment: Yes only if NetBlocks reports “not heavily filtered/whitelisted” for most users for >24h before May 1 (IRST).  
2. Outside view base rate: 6%.  
3. Consistency check: “In 6 out of 100 timelines, NetBlocks reports Iran is not heavily filtered/whitelisted for most users for >24h before May 1.” Plausible.  
4. Top evidence (most significant):
   - NetBlocks repeatedly reports “heavily filtered on a whitelist basis” for ordinary users (late Jan; echoed in Feb reporting).
   - Expert consensus in BBC/CNN: patterns suggest whitelisting/tiered access; “may never return to normal.”
   - Political incentive after severe crackdown favors durable control over open access.
   - Economic pressure could force some restoration, but likely not full de-filtering for “most users.”
5. Blind spot (most-likely-to-make-this-look-silly): A rapid political stabilization/deal (or leadership crisis) leads to genuine broad normalization and NetBlocks explicitly says filtering/whitelisting is no longer heavy for most users. This would push probability sharply upward.  
6. Status quo nudge: Given persistence from Jan → Feb, bias toward “No” is warranted.

Probability: 6%
