Analysis:
1. Paraphrased resolution (≤30 words)
NetBlocks must report Iran’s Internet is no longer “heavily filtered/whitelisted” for most users for ≥24 h at any time before 1 May 2026 (IRST).

2. Source analysis (quality, fact vs. opinion, date)
• NetBlocks posts (27–30 Jan 2026): real-time measurement; gold-standard factual data on filtering—very high quality.  
• CNN, BBC, The National, RFE/RL, Wired (17 Jan – 6 Feb 2026): mainstream outlets quoting NetBlocks/Kentik/Filterwatch; facts (traffic levels, government statements) distinguished from expert opinions (Rashidi, Madory, Alimardani). High quality.  
• Filterwatch/Project Ainita reports (17 Jan 2026): credible NGO research; provide structural data, but some claims (permanent cut-off) are informed opinion—moderate quality.  
• Iranian officials (Vice-president Afshin; Deputy Min. Akbari; FM Araqchi, Jan-Feb 2026): primary statements; factual as to what was said, but biased motives—use cautiously.  
• AskNews economic pieces (bne IntelliNews 9 Feb 2026): factual macro-cost estimates; moderate quality.  
• Remaining articles (geo.fr, Habr etc.) largely derivative, anecdotal—weak quality.

3. Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence  
A. NetBlocks still finds “heavily filtered/whitelisted” 32 days after shutdown.  
B. Repeated government statements that international web will stay restricted until at least Nowruz (20 Mar) and hints it may become permanent.

Moderate evidence  
C. Filterwatch & Wired document long-term investment in whitelist/DPI architecture, suggesting structural entrenchment.  
D. Economic losses (~$35 m/day) create regime incentive to loosen, as seen in 2019/2022 restorations.

Weak evidence  
E. Starlink/Conduit circumvention successes—help some users but don’t affect “most users” metric.  
F. Possible diplomatic thaw (Oman-mediated talks) could give regime cover to ease controls.

4. Timeframe analysis  
• 82 days remain until deadline.  
• If this window were halved to 41 days my probability would fall a further 6 pp (to ~14 %).  
• If doubled to 164 days (≃ Aug 2026) I would raise probability ~10 pp (to ~30 %), reflecting historical mean-reversion after longer horizons.

5. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (section above): 55 % chance of re-opening within three months of a major shutdown.  
Key downward adjustments:  
−20 pp Longest blackout in Iran’s history, already >30 days with no improvement; historically, once heavy filtering persists >4 weeks, only ~1 in 5 cases revert before the 3-month mark.  
−10 pp Public, repeated regime intent to institutionalise whitelist access and invest in DPI hardware (structural, hard to reverse).  
−5 pp External support (Russia/China tech) and arrests of Starlink users show capability and will.  
+5 pp Severe economic damage and business-sector pressure; previous Iranian episodes ended partly for this reason.  
Net inside-view probability ≈ 25 %.

6. Scenario decomposition (binary)  
YES by 1 May 2026 (≈25 %)  
• Regime calculates economic & diplomatic costs outweigh benefits and relaxes controls around Nowruz; NetBlocks detects open traffic nationwide.  
NO by 1 May 2026 (≈75 %) – status quo  
• Whitelist regime proves technically viable; protests suppressed; limited gradual easing never reaches “most users” threshold.

Probability calibration
“I expect that in roughly 25 out of 100 similar situations NetBlocks would report Iran’s Internet is no longer heavily filtered for most users for >24 h before 1 May 2026.”

Checklist:
• Title & criteria paraphrased ✅  
• Outside-view base: 55 % ✅  
• Final probability rooted in base, adjusted −30 pp net ✅  
• Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
  1. NetBlocks still reporting whitelist after 32 days.  
  2. Government vows restrictions until at least Nowruz, maybe permanent.  
  3. New DPI/whitelist infrastructure reportedly installed.  
  4. Heavy economic losses pressure regime.  
• Blind-spot: Sudden elite split or foreign-policy deal prompting immediate connectivity restoration; would raise probability >60 %.  
• Status-quo bias checked—majority outcome remains continued heavy filtering. ✅

Probability: 25%
