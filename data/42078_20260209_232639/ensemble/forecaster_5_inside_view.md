Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)
1. GEO.fr 9 Feb 26 – Feature quoting Filter.Watch and NetBlocks. Repeats technical traffic data and legal penalties. Factual portions (traffic down 98 %, whitelist in force) are sourced to NetBlocks/Filter-Watch → high quality; commentary on Starlink jail terms partly anecdotal.  
2. RTBF 9 Feb 26 – Regional public broadcaster summarising Access-Now data on global shutdowns. Only broad context; no new Iran-specific facts → limited value.  
3. Habr 9 Feb 26 – Russian tech blog explaining whitelist architecture, draws parallels with Russia. Iran references are secondary; technical description credible but unsourced → moderate quality, mostly opinion.  
4. bne IntelliNews 9 Feb 26 – Business outlet detailing economic damage estimates (quoted from Iran MoC). Data points (IR R 100 tn loss) are traceable; reliable for economics.  
5. Wired 9 Feb 26 – US tech magazine, cites Project Ainita/Holistic Resilience reports. Good investigative reputation; facts about NIN collapse and IRGC ownership treated as moderate evidence.  
6. RFE/RL liveblog 9 Feb 26 – Public broadcaster collating NetBlocks posts and diplomatic notes. Technical status quotes are direct from NetBlocks → strong.  
7. The National 6 Feb 26 – Gulf newspaper; quotes Deputy Minister Akbari and NetBlocks. Confirms whitelisting continues → strong.  
8. CNN 30 Jan 26 – International outlet with Kentik, Rashidi, Alimardani on-record. Supplies traffic data and expert expectations of permanent filtering → strong.  
9. BBC 28 Jan 26 – UK public broadcaster using Kentik and Shargh. Confirms tiered access and whitelist trials → strong.  
10. NetBlocks Mastodon 27 & 30 Jan 26 – Primary, real-time traffic monitors. States “web still heavily filtered on a whitelist basis”. Most authoritative technical evidence.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (all point to “No restoration”):  
• NetBlocks, Kentik, Filter.Watch – independent monitors showing heavy filtering one month after shutdown.  
• Two previous nationwide Iranian shutdowns (2019, 2022) never returned to pre-crackdown openness.  
• Government statements: access not back before Nowruz and “gradual/localised” only.  
• Structural factor: 15-year investment in National Information Network + new Chinese middleboxes.  

Moderate evidence (same direction):  
• Wired & Habr reports on completed surveillance infrastructure.  
• MoC estimate of heavy economic losses but no sign of policy reversal.  
• Diplomatic tension (US threats, EU sanctions) tends to harden regime stance historically.  

Weak/offsetting evidence (toward “Yes”):  
• Economic cost numbers could pressure regime to relax.  
• Tail-risk scenarios of political collapse or reform; no concrete indicators yet.  
• Technical fragility: NIN unexpectedly failed during 8 Jan blackout; could force temporary open routing.  

Net balance: strong preponderance of evidence that filtering will persist.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
81 days remain until 1 May 26.  
• If window were halved (≈40 d) probability would fall further: ~5 %.  
• If doubled (≈160 d) probability rises but stays low: ~12–15 % – still below 1-in-6 because regime’s stated plan is “permanent”.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (0/2 previous cases) = 9 %.  
Downward shift drivers:   
• Multiple independent monitors confirm new whitelist regime now operational (strong).  
• Official declarations that restoration, if any, will be strictly conditional and after Nowruz (>40 d away) (strong).  
• Installation of Chinese DPI hardware makes quick rollback technically difficult (moderate).  
Offsetting upward drivers:  
• Severe economic pain; merchants are a key regime constituency (moderate, +0.5 ppt).  
• Low-probability regime crisis leading to concession or collapse (tail, +1 ppt).  

Net adjustment ≈ –2 ppt → 7–8 %. I round to 8 %.

Probability calibration
Interpretation: In 8 out of 100 comparable futures, NetBlocks will record >24 h of largely unfiltered internet for most Iranians before 1 May 2026.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Iran’s internet become NOT heavily filtered/whitelisted for >24 h anytime before 1 May 26?  
2. Base rate stated: 9 %.  
3. Consistency check: “8 of 100 times, filtering ends for >24 h” – matches reasoning.  
4. Key evidence (20-word each):  
   i. NetBlocks traffic still shows whitelist filtering one month after blackout.  
   ii. Government says no broad restoration before Nowruz; hints change is permanent.  
   iii. Past 2019 & 2022 shutdowns never fully reversed.  
   iv. Chinese middlebox hardware enables long-term control.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden elite split topples Supreme National Security Council, provisional government restores internet to court legitimacy. Would push probability above 50 %.  
6. Status-quo bias considered – status quo firmly favours continued heavy filtering; nudged probability slightly downward.

Probability: 8%
