Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. AP News (29 Dec 2025): Straight‐news wire; documents the trigger (currency collapse, large protests). High factual reliability. No technical detail on internet.  
2. AP News (4 Dec 2025): Same quality; shows depth of economic crisis—indirectly relevant because severe crises correlate with harsher security measures.  
3. AP News (2 Jan 2026): Reliable; confirms protests had turned nationwide and deadly before the shutdown.  
4. Amnesty explainer & historical Wikipedia entry (cited in background): Secondary but well‐sourced; establish Iran’s long history of censorship.  
5. NetBlocks Mastodon posts (27 & 30 Jan 2026): Primary, tech-specialist, timestamped. State that after 20 days the network is “heavily filtered on a whitelist basis.” Very high relevance and credibility.  
6. RFE/RL (20 Jan 2026): Western public broadcaster; quotes NetBlocks and Iranian digital-rights NGOs. Little partisan bias on the technical facts.  
7. The National (6 Feb 2026): Gulf-based newspaper; cites NetBlocks and named analysts. Reasonable reliability.  
8. CNN (30 Jan 2026): Mainstream outlet; again leans on NetBlocks plus named experts (Rashidi, Madory, Alimardani).  
9. Guardian (28 Jan 2026): UK broadsheet; uses NetBlocks traffic data and Kentik analyst Madory.  
10. Agent report (history of 2019 & 2022 shutdowns): Collates open-source NetBlocks data and press archives; no new facts but good synthesis. Caveat: second-hand.

Across sources, factual statements on internet status come from the same technical monitors (NetBlocks, Kentik, Cloudflare). Opinions are quoted only from identifiable experts (Rashidi, Madory, Alimardani, Filterbaan), which we keep.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. Previous Iran-wide shutdowns (2019 fuel-price protests; 2022 Mahsa Amini protests).  
2. Large-scale political shutdowns in other authoritarian states (Myanmar 2021, Kazakhstan 2022).  
3. Routine short-lived shutdowns elsewhere (e.g., India’s region-specific cuts).

Class 1 is closest: same regime, similar security calculus, same technical infrastructure (National Information Network) and the same monitoring organisation (NetBlocks). We adopt Class 1.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today → deadline: 81 days (~12 weeks).  
Empirical timeline:  
• 2019: near-total blackout lasted 5 days; connectivity mostly restored within two more days, BUT Instagram & Telegram stayed blocked indefinitely. So “not heavily filtered” for most users never actually returned—social media remained banned.  
• 2022: curfew-style throttling began 21 Sep 2022; nightly cuts ended after ~3 weeks, yet WhatsApp/Instagram blocks persisted to date. Again, normality never fully returned.  
Thus, in the last two major cycles Iran has not lifted core blocks even years later. The base rate of “full unfiltered internet returning within three months of a major nationwide shutdown” is effectively 0/2 ≈ 0 %. Even if we allow a looser criterion (major filtering ends within three months), success is 0/2.  

(d) Justification  
Status quo: Heavy filtering continues one month after the 8 Jan cutoff; regime signals no restoration before Nowruz (~6 weeks away). Parallel with 2019 fails because the government is deliberately trialling a whitelist architecture, something new and explicitly endorsed by hard-liners. Economic pain is real (≈ $30–40 M per day) but 2022 and now 2026 show that Tehran is willing to absorb large costs. Elite “white-SIM” culture further reduces elite pressure to liberalise.  External leverage (US threats, Starlink smuggling) seems inadequate; only ~50 k terminals in a 90 M population and authorities are jamming them.  

Experts (Rashidi, Alimardani) uniformly expect tighter control, not relaxation, during 2026. Markets: no liquid prediction market exists, but digital-rights NGOs publicly anticipate long-term whitelisting.  

Therefore, the outside view—based strictly on historical base rate and structural incentives—puts a low chance on Iranian internet becoming “not heavily filtered/whitelisted” for >24 h in the next 81 days.

Outside view calibration:

• Base rate from Class 1: 0 / 2 = 0 %.  
• Acknowledge small-sample uncertainty and possibility of a rare concession under extraordinary economic pressure or a political collapse (tail risk).  
• Historical “upset” frequency for authoritarian policy reversals within short horizons ~5–10 %.  
• I apply a Beta(1,9) style shrinkage: move the 0 % base up toward 10 % by one part in ten to account for tail possibilities and sample size. Result ≈ 8–10 %.  
• Round but stay precise: 9 %.

Outside View Prediction:
9%
