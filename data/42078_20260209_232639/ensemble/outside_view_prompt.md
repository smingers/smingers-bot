You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will Iran's Internet not be "heavily filtered/whitelisted" for most users before May 2026?

Question background:
On December 29, 2025, [Iran’s largest protests in three years](https://apnews.com/article/iran-traders-protest-rial-currency-ddc955739fb412b642251dee10638f03) erupted after [the country’s currency plummeted](https://apnews.com/article/iran-gold-silver-jewelry-sales-israel-war-0e774bc3c2fea972ab3225e1864a438e) to a record low against the U.S. dollar, and the head of the Central Bank resigned.&#x20;

Since then [the US President threatened the Iranian government and supported the protesters](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-trump-4e2232877bd1fff11cd80a33db47353d), [the protests escalated and became nationwide](https://apnews.com/video/what-to-know-about-the-protests-in-iran-30bed7d6f14f4865b583c9293df83df2), and [the Iranian theocracy brutally responded to the protesters](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-us-israel-war-economy-54e4024a0b9e6a9f3ab49153c8e28f05).

On January 8, 2026, as tensions rose Iran’s Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi (who has been in exile for almost 50 years) called for demonstrations. [The Iranian theocracy responded that day by shutting down the Internet and phone communications](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-us-israel-war-nuclear-economy-ebddd998fbe7903e70ca62127250ebcb) for the country's population of over 90 million.&#x20;

As [Amnesty International outlines](https://www.amnesty.org.au/everything-you-need-to-know-about-internet-shutdowns/),

> Internet shutdowns pose a threat to human rights because they restrict the ability of important human rights activities to be organised and conducted... but are also in direct violation of a number of human rights laws. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has declared that “states … must not block or hinder internet connectivity in relation to peaceful assemblies.”

On 15 January, 2026, [reports suggested that international web access will not be available until at least the Iranian New Year in late March](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg5gegrdq3go). [Iran has a long history of Internet censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Iran).

On January 27, 2026, [NetBlocks reported](https://mastodon.social/@netblocks/115967507497404228) "With #Iran's internet shutdown approaching day 20, many networks are becoming visible internationally. HOWEVER: No return to usual: Web still heavily filtered on a whitelist basis. Circumvention still needed: The opening of protocols can enable new workarounds."

This remains the situation as of [NetBlocks update three days later](https://mastodon.social/@netblocks/115985042778046760).&#x20;

The recent events have become ["the bloodiest crackdown on dissent since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution"](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-nationwide-scale-us-trump-0eecd9962240600150530261dfab03f2) with at least 3,117 people killed (although [other estimates are far higher](https://thebulletin.org/2026/01/irans-internet-shutdown-tells-a-larger-story-digital-repression-is-on-the-rise/)). [The economic damage has also been significant](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-crackdown-internet-business-costs-a0bd2df1d13355dcc28f46e5b5b3c893), further exacerbating tensions.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve as Yes if [NetBlocks](https://netblocks.org/) reports that Internet access in Iran is <u>not</u> "heavily filtered/whitelisted" for most users, for a continuous period of more than 24 hours, before May 1, 2026 (IRST).

# Summary of Article: "Iranians seek portable wealth as hedge against falling currency after Israel war"

**Source:** AP News  
**Date:** December 4, 2025

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Gold prices in Iran:** Over the summer, 1-gram, 18-karat gold bars traded at around 115 million rials (approximately $100). By Saturday (early December 2025), the price of a gold coin exceeded 1.2 billion rials for the first time in Iran's history.

- **Currency exchange rate:** The rial now trades at over 1 million to $1.

- **Gold sales volume:** One merchant (Mansour, 28) reported selling 6 kilos (13.2 pounds) of gold to ordinary people in two weeks, describing this as unprecedented demand.

- **Other asset prices (summer 2025):** Gold coins were over $1,000; 1-kilogram silver ingots were nearly $2,000.

- **Population movement during 12-day war:** Tens of thousands of Iranians living in Tehran fled the capital during the 12-day war with Israel, heading to the countryside or the Caspian Sea coast. Some areas were overwhelmed by newcomers, and ATMs ran out of cash or became nonfunctional.

- **Historical context:** During the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the rial hit an all-time high of 120 to $1.

## Key Context:

The article describes Iranians rushing to purchase "value-preserving assets" including gold, silver, diamonds, cryptocurrencies, and foreign currency as hedges against inflation, sanctions, and the weakening rial. This behavior is driven by:

1. Economic pressures from international sanctions
2. Fear of another war with Israel following a recent 12-day conflict
3. Reports of mass layoffs stemming from electricity problems, consumer demand issues, and sanctions
4. U.S. crackdowns on Iranian crypto-sellers
5. The need for portable wealth that can be easily carried in case of crisis

## Named Source Opinions:

Multiple unnamed individuals are quoted (using only first names or partial identification "for fear of reprisals"):

- **Mansour (28, gold merchant):** Described unprecedented demand, with people rushing to buy because they fear savings will lose value
- **Behzad Rashvand (57, grandfather):** Views gold as the only protection against rampant inflation
- **Amir Ramezani (top gold trader in Tehran):** Reports that well-to-do families are selling assets to maintain their lifestyle as incomes no longer match their established standard of living
- **Ahmad (49, fabric importer):** Plans to convert all liquid assets into foreign currency and gold, stating "In an emergency, I need to be able to carry my assets with me if I have to leave"

The article notes that wealthier investors are turning to diamonds and gemstones as discreet, portable stores of value, with jewelers in Tehran and Mashhad reporting rising demand.

# Summary of AP News Article (January 2, 2026)

## Key Facts and Statistics:
- **Death toll**: At least 8 people killed in violence surrounding the demonstrations (as of this article's date)
- **Protest duration**: Sixth day of protests (starting around December 29, 2025)
- **Geographic scope**: Demonstrations reached over 100 locations in 22 of Iran's 31 provinces (according to U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency)
- **Currency situation**: $1 = approximately 1.4 million rials
- **Scale comparison**: Described as "the biggest in Iran since 2022" (Mahsa Amini protests), but "yet to be as widespread and intense as those surrounding the death of Amini"

## Named Source Opinions:
- **Naysan Rafati (International Crisis Group analyst)**: Warned that while grievances are due to Iranian government policies, Trump's statement could be used as proof of external involvement, and violent crackdowns risk inviting U.S. involvement

## Government Positions:
- **Iranian officials**: Alleged (without evidence) that Israel and U.S. were stoking demonstrations
- **Reformist President Masoud Pezeshkian**: Acknowledged limited ability to address economic issues
- **U.S. official** (anonymous): No major changes to U.S. troop levels or preparations in the Middle East following Trump's posts

## Context:

- Iran's Internet policy has crossed into "absolute blockage"
- Disconnection is now the default with access granted only selectively
- Describes a shift from "widespread filtering" to "barracks-style governance over communications"

**Government spokeswoman Fatemeh Mohajerani (reported by Iran Wire on January 15):**
- International web access would not be available until at least the Persian New Year in March

**Ahmad Nirumand (head of Iran's Digital Transformation Commission, a state-affiliated entity):**
- "Given the country's current conditions, there is no place for restoring access to foreign messenger apps"
- Signals a post-blackout Internet locked to state-approved channels only

## Less Reliable/Unnamed Sources:

- A government official vowed on January 19 that Internet access would return to "normal" by the end of the week (no specific name provided)

## Additional Context:

- Iran has regulated access to popular social media platforms since 2009
- First nationwide Internet blackout occurred in November 2019 during fuel price protests
- Internet disruptions also imposed during 2022 Women, Life, Freedom protests
- Hard-liners support the digital blackout citing national security concerns
- No plan to restore access to Instagram, WhatsApp, and Telegram even if limited Internet access returns
- Many Iranians previously used VPNs to bypass government controls and access blocked foreign social media apps

# Summary of "Iran's internet slowly returns but remains heavily filtered"

**Key Facts:**

1. **Current Status**: Iran's internet blackout has technically ended, but access remains heavily filtered and largely blocked according to technology experts, internet monitoring groups, and Iranians abroad.

2. **Government Position**: 
   - Iran's government has rejected allegations of a clampdown
   - Deputy Minister of Communications Behzad Akbari acknowledged internet access has not returned to pre-protest levels (protests began end of December)
   - Akbari attributed disruptions to "restrictions beyond the control of the Ministry of Communications" without providing details
   - Tehran denies internet is filtered or whitelisted, calling such accusations "entirely baseless"

3. **NetBlocks Assessment**: 
   - Reports from Iran show authorities continue to heavily filter the internet
   - "Whitelisting and intermittent connectivity continue to limit Iranians' contact with the outside world"
   - "Networks are visible internationally but broadly restricted"

4. **User Experience**:
   - An Iranian expat in Michigan reported: "We still can't communicate and internet is very spotty"
   - His father managed to connect briefly to confirm family safety

5. **Starlink/LEO Services**:
   - Initial reports suggested Elon Musk's Starlink was activated in Iran during the blackout
   - Connections were limited due to lack of Starlink terminals
   - Experts allege Iranian authorities have become more proficient at blocking LEO services
   - Technology analyst Dinah van der Geest noted "LEO-specific jammers across Iran and other repressive regimes" and door-to-door seizures of unauthorized terminals

6. **Context**: The blackout was described as "among the longest ever recorded"

# Summary of "Iran blackout shows signs of tiered access, NetBlocks says"

**Key Facts and Statistics:**

- As of January 20, 2026, Iran's nationwide internet blackout had passed 280 hours (approximately 11.7 days)
- The blackout affects a population of more than 90 million people
- Approximately 300 shops in Rasht's historic bazaar were destroyed by fire on January 8
- According to a municipal employee cited by witness Bardia, around 600 people were killed in Rasht alone
- Other witnesses estimate the death toll may be as high as 3,000 over two days of unrest in Rasht
- The article notes at least 100 protesters were killed in Mahshahr during November 2019 unrest (for historical comparison)

**Named Source Opinions:**

- **NetBlocks** (internet monitoring group): Reported on Tuesday, January 20, 2026 that "traffic on select platforms points to an emergent strategy of whitelisting" - authorities appear to be allowing limited access to select platforms while keeping most services blocked

**Less Reliable/Anonymous Source Information:**

- **Bardia** (Iranian student based in Berlin, present in Rasht during crackdown): Provided detailed eyewitness account describing:
  - January 8-9 events as "a war zone"

# Summary of CNN Article: "The future of Iran's internet connectivity is still bleak, even as weeks-long blackout begins to lift"

**Date:** January 30, 2026  
**Author:** Lauren Kent

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Partial restoration:** Internet connectivity was partially restored on Tuesday (approximately January 28, 2026), nearly 20 days after the Iranian government cut internet and international calls
- **Starlink penetration:** Estimated only about 50,000 Starlink terminals have been smuggled into Iran (country of ~92 million people), according to digital activists cited by Freedom House. The article notes estimates vary.
- **Starlink cost:** Terminals cost about $2,000 on the black market
- **Historical comparison:** This shutdown was the longest in Iranian history – nearly two weeks longer than the 2019 internet shutdown
- **Economic cost of 2019 shutdown:** Former head of Iran's Chamber of Commerce estimated it cost $1.5 billion

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

**Amir Rashidi** (cybersecurity expert, director of digital rights and security at Miaan Group):
- "Every time we have an internet shutdown in Iran, usually we don't go back to normal"
- States the Iranian government has made strides toward implementing "whitelisting" technology that allows only people with security clearance to access the international web
- "We do believe they're going to rapidly move into the direction of implementing that policy… the infrastructure exists"
- Believes the Iranian government will "invest more in controlling satellite internet" in the future

**Doug Madory** (director of internet analysis at Kentik):
- Described internet traffic patterns as "very jagged" since partial restoration
- Speculated "maybe a new traffic filtering system has been installed and can't keep up"

**Mahsa Alimardani** (associate director of technology threats and opportunities at Witness):
- Described Iran's population as "one of the most sophisticated in the world when it comes to circumventing web restrictions"
- "What is really becoming a game changer is the fact that we can have connectivity that does not depend on sovereignty"
- Noted some Iranian regime efforts to disrupt Starlink signals using electronic warfare tools are "believed to be exaggerated by the regime, as it tries to deter more people from buying satellite internet"
- "I don't think within the regime itself they even know what direction they're going to go"

**Antonio Cesarano** (lead product manager for Proton VPN):
- Confirmed that on January 8, the blackout cut off Proton VPN's user base in Iran
- "What we've been observing in the last year or so is that people prepare themselves… people have probably multiple VPNs"

## Key Technical Details:

**NetBlocks statement (Wednesday, approximately January 29, 2026):**
- "Most ordinary users still face heavy filtering and intermittent service under a whitelist system despite a significant increase in internationally visible networks and datacenters"

**Whitelisting vs. Blacklisting:**
- Whitelisting involves a small subset of users being cleared to have unrestricted access to international internet (via special SIM cards or permissions)
- Everyone else is censored and forced to rely on the national internet where the regime can track users and block unapproved websites
- This represents a shift from Iran's longstanding tactic of blacklisting specific websites and apps

**Historical context of censorship:**
- Instagram was blocked after the 2022 internet shutdown
- Telegram was banned following 2018 protests

**Circumvention tools:**
- Starlink (made free in Iran by Elon Musk's company)
- VPNs (historically funded by US government, though Trump administration cut funding last year)
- Iranian government is cracking down on Starlink users with arrests and prison sentences for possession

**Economic factors:**
- Iran's isolation makes broad censorship easier (no international credit cards, no foreign services like Netflix, Uber, or Amazon)
- However, there are still economic stakeholders within the regime who benefit from internet access

# Summary of Article: "Mahsa Alimardani: To Help Countries Like Iran, We Need To Scale Up Starlink"

**Source:** RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty  
**Date:** January 29, 2026

## Key Facts and Observations:

### Current Internet Status (as of January 28-29, 2026):
- **NetBlocks reported on January 28** that most regular Internet users still face heavy filtering and only intermittent service under a whitelist system, despite a significant increase in internationally visible networks and datacenters
- Iranians are slowly managing to get online using anti-filtering tools
- There has been an increase in connectivity over the Iranian network in recent days, but it's unstable and not consistent
- The shutdown continues in large parts, though there is a "bigger window" of access
- More people are getting online using proxy servers, but connectivity "comes and goes"

### Expert Opinion - Mahsa Alimardani:
**Background:** Associate director for the Technology Threats and Opportunities program at WITNESS; has been studying information controls and Internet access for over a decade; recently spoke at World Economic Forum side event in Davos about Iran's Internet restrictions

**Key Points:**

1. **Precedent:** While there are precedents globally for longer Internet shutdowns (e.g., Kashmir by Indian government), Iran has broken its own record for longest Internet shutdown

2. **Starlink as Solution:**
   - Small amounts of information during the shutdown came out through Starlink satellite terminals smuggled into Iran
   - Current market value: **$2,000 per Starlink terminal** (not realistic for a country in economic crisis)
   - This represents "very privileged and inaccessible type of Internet"
   - Alimardani is working on scaling satellite Internet for potentially 90 million people

3. **Coalition Effort:**
   - Campaign called "direct 2 sell" (direct2sell.org)
   - Coalition includes: WITNESS, Access Now, For Human Rights (CHRI), strategic litigation project, and Article 19
   - Goal is to scale satellite Internet beyond current limited Starlink access

4. **Assessment of International Response:**
   - Countries need to do more than "symbolic statements and condemnations"
   - Real investment needed in connectivity and documentation efforts
   - Human rights sector has been "decimated through cuts to development agencies"

5. **Broader Context:**
   - Traditional Internet access governed by "digital sovereignty" through national infrastructure
   - This framework is "very harmful" in authoritarian contexts
   - Need to "revolutionize and rethink" traditional means of Internet access
   - Referenced academic Azadeh Akbari (professor in Europe) who wrote about breaking the notion of digital sovereignty given Iran's example

**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off at the end.

# Summary of "Iran appears to ease internet blackout as cost of shutdown mounts"

**Key Facts and Statistics:**

- Iranian authorities have partially relaxed internet restrictions, but have not fully removed them
- Internet traffic to Iran reached approximately 60% of pre-shutdown levels at one point (as of Tuesday, January 27, 2026)
- The internet shutdown is costing Iranian authorities up to $36 million per day, according to a recent estimate by a government minister
- The shutdown began on January 8, 2026
- Previously unavailable Iranian Telegram channels came back online on Wednesday (January 28, 2026)

**Expert Opinions (Named Sources):**

- **Doug Madory, Director of Internet Analysis at Kentik**: Described connectivity as "a real patchwork" with "some kind of degraded service" for most users who have access. He stated authorities appear to be "developing a content blocking system by trial and error." He noted the internet traffic pattern shows "jagged peaks" rather than a smooth curve, indicating continued throttling. He emphasized: "It's definitely not restored to pre-8 January levels" and "Every day is different. Even within a day, it's not consistent."

**Reports from Organizations:**

- **Filterwatch** (an organization monitoring Iran's internet traffic): Reports that certain services like Google, Bing, and ChatGPT are now available to some users on a province-to-province basis, but many are unstable and many social media and messaging platforms remain unusable
- **Cloudflare and Kentik data**: Show uneven restoration of internet traffic beginning Tuesday morning

**Additional Context:**

- Iranian CEOs have been gathering at the Tehran Chamber of Commerce dining hall to access monitored internet, with each person restricted to 30 minutes of access due to high demand
- Two weeks prior, a government spokesperson reportedly said internet would be restricted until at least Nowruz (March 20, 2026)
- The article compares the estimated costs to the OECD's estimate of Egypt's 2011 internet shutdown during Tahrir protests at $90 million
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Search NetBlocks reports on Iran 2019 and 2022 protests, durations until filtering ended, and any instances where NetBlocks said internet “returned to normal” after whitelisting periods. Also collect official Iranian statements on restoration timelines.
Drawing on the additional material retrieved, the picture that can be documented with primary-source citations for the 2019 and 2022 protest cycles is now as follows.

I. November 2019 nationwide shutdown (“fuel-price protests”)

1. Onset, depth and first reconnection  
   • NetBlocks recorded fixed-line and mobile connectivity collapsing to 7 % of ordinary levels within hours of 16 Nov 2019, 18:45 local time (IFJ, 18 Nov 2019).  
   • No new dataset contradicts the previously-established timeline: near-total blackout from the evening of 16 Nov to the morning of 21 Nov.

2. Progressive recovery and end-point  
   • Al-Jazeera’s Tehran dispatch of 27 Nov 2019 reported that “connectivity started being restored late last week” and that, by 27 Nov, Iranians were “getting their digital lives back on track” after a “nearly seven-day long blackout” (Al-Jazeera, 27 Nov 2019).  
   • The article cites NetBlocks’ figure of “5 percent for several days” at the apex but, like all other located coverage, presents the restoration in descriptive terms; there is still no quotation of a NetBlocks tweet or bulletin declaring that the network had “returned to normal.”

3. Iranian official statements on restoration  
   • ICT Minister Mohammad-Javad Azari-Jahromi told state TV on 18 Nov 2019 that the blackout would be lifted “soon” while emphasising that critical services had migrated to the National Information Network (CNN citation repeated in IFJ piece, 18 Nov 2019).  
   • Interior-ministry announcements of a province-by-province plan are referenced in secondary sources but remain elusive in primary form; they are therefore still a gap.

4. NetBlocks language  
   • Despite extensive press quoting of NetBlocks’ percentage metrics between 21 – 27 Nov, none of the retrieved texts contains the phrase “internet returned to normal” or similar wording attributed to NetBlocks.

II. September–October 2022 disruptions (“Women, Life, Freedom” protests)

1. Nature of the restrictions  
   • NetBlocks documented “curfew-style mobile internet disruptions” starting 21 Sep 2022; these combined nightly nationwide mobile cuts with daytime throttling and the permanent blocking of WhatsApp and Instagram.  
   • Freedom House’s 2022 country report confirms that “authorities blocked access to WhatsApp and Instagram, disrupted internet and mobile services, and violently cracked down on protesters” (Freedom House, 2022).

2. End-date of filtering / resumption of connectivity  
   • None of the new sources gives a specific day on which the nightly mobile-data cuts stopped. Freedom House’s narrative, compiled mid-2023, still describes the blocks as ongoing.  
   • Consequently, the total duration until full nationwide connectivity (as opposed to partial daytime service) resumed cannot yet be documented.

3. Iranian government timelines  
   • No contemporaneous quotation from Communications Minister Eisa Zarepour promising a restoration date has been located. International coverage instead cites him as saying restrictions would last “as long as security considerations require” (Freedom House, 2022). This remains an unclosed gap.

4. NetBlocks wording  
   • As with 2019, no article or dataset retrieved to date quotes NetBlocks stating that service had “returned to normal” after October 2022. On the contrary, later retrospectives (CNN, 30 Jan 2026) stress that “every time we have an internet shutdown in Iran, usually we don’t go back to normal.”

III. 2026 (contextual corroboration)

NetBlocks’ commentary during the January 2026 blackout explicitly rejected any notion of normalisation, observing that “most ordinary users still face heavy filtering … under a whitelist system” even after partial traffic returned (CNN, 30 Jan 2026; IranIntl, 18 Jan 2026). This negative evidence reinforces the inference that NetBlocks avoids the “returned to normal” formulation in its Iran coverage.

IV. Consolidated answers to the original research questions

• Duration of the 2019 shutdown until filtering ended: near-total blackout 16 Nov – 21 Nov 2019 (~5 days), followed by phased reconnection that was largely complete by 27 Nov 2019 (IFJ; Al-Jazeera).  
• Duration of the 2022 restrictions: precise end-point still unverified; NetBlocks bulletins confirm nightly mobile cuts from 21 Sep 2022 into early October, and Freedom House notes that platform blocks (Instagram, WhatsApp) remained in place well after protests subsided.  
• Instances of NetBlocks saying the internet “returned to normal”: none found across 2019, 2022 or 2026 material. The phrase appears only in journalists’ paraphrases or in other countries’ contexts.  
• Official Iranian statements on restoration timelines:  
  – 2019: ICT Minister Azari-Jahromi (18 Nov 2019) promised the blackout would end “soon” but gave no firm date (IFJ, 18 Nov 2019). Interior-ministry scheduling remains uncollected.  
  – 2022: No primary-source commitment located; Zarepour is cited only for saying restrictions would continue “as long as security considerations require” (Freedom House, 2022).

V. Remaining information gaps

1. Primary NetBlocks tweets or blog posts (24 – 27 Nov 2019) that show the exact percentage jump above 90 % and might definitively mark the end of the 2019 filtering.  
2. Any NetBlocks bulletin or tweet in which the organisation itself states, affirms or denies that connectivity “returned to normal.” A comprehensive negative result would be valuable evidence.  
3. A dated Iranian government statement—parliamentary, ministerial or agency level—setting a timeline for lifting the September 2022 curfew-style mobile shutdowns.  
4. Confirmation of the final night on which nationwide mobile data was disabled in 2022 and the first night it was not.

To close these gaps, additional narrowly-targeted searches are advisable, especially of NetBlocks’ X/Twitter timeline for 24-27 Nov 2019 and 10-31 Oct 2022, and of Persian-language parliamentary transcripts or IRNA dispatches quoting Zarepour during October 2022.

With the current corpus, however, the key findings requested in the original brief have been substantiated as far as publicly available evidence permits.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
