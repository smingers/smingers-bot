[The Iranian theocracy responded that day by shutting down the Internet and phone communications](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-us-israel-war-nuclear-economy-ebddd998fbe7903e70ca62127250ebcb) for the country's population of over 90 million.&#x20;\n\nAs [Amnesty International outlines](https://www.amnesty.org.au/everything-you-need-to-know-about-internet-shutdowns/),\n\n> Internet shutdowns pose a threat to human rights because they restrict the ability of important human rights activities to be organised and conducted... but are also in direct violation of a number of human rights laws. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has declared that \u201cstates \u2026 must not block or hinder internet connectivity in relation to peaceful assemblies.\u201d\n\nOn 15 January, 2026, [reports suggested that international web access will not be available until at least the Iranian New Year in late March](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg5gegrdq3go). [Iran has a long history of Internet censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Iran).\n\nOn January 27, 2026, [NetBlocks reported](https://mastodon.social/@netblocks/115967507497404228) \"With #Iran's internet shutdown approaching day 20, many networks are becoming visible internationally. HOWEVER: No return to usual: Web still heavily filtered on a whitelist basis. Circumvention still needed: The opening of protocols can enable new workarounds.\"\n\nThis remains the situation as of [NetBlocks update three days later](https://mastodon.social/@netblocks/115985042778046760).&#x20;\n\nThe recent events have become [\"the bloodiest crackdown on dissent since Iran\u2019s 1979 Islamic Revolution\"](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-nationwide-scale-us-trump-0eecd9962240600150530261dfab03f2) with at least 3,117 people killed (although [other estimates are far higher](https://thebulletin.org/2026/01/irans-internet-shutdown-tells-a-larger-story-digital-repression-is-on-the-rise/)). [The economic damage has also been significant](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-crackdown-internet-business-costs-a0bd2df1d13355dcc28f46e5b5b3c893), further exacerbating tensions.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41869,\"question_id\":41607}}`",
