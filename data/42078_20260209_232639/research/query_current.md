Analysis:
The market will resolve based only on NetBlocks’ public measurements and wording, specifically whether they stop describing Iran’s connectivity as “heavily filtered/whitelisted” for more than 24 h before 1 May 2026. I therefore need the very latest NetBlocks updates and any corroborating technical reports (e.g., routing data, VPN usage statistics) published after 9 Feb 2026. News on negotiations inside Iran, statements by the ICT ministry, or new circumvention efforts may hint at policy shifts, but NetBlocks’ real-time tweets, blogposts and graphs are decisive. Consequently, queries should focus on NetBlocks + Iran after 9 Feb 2026 and on phrases like “whitelist”, “filtering”, “normalisation”, “internet restored”, etc.
