Analysis:
To judge whether Iran will end “heavy filtering/whitelisting” before May 2026 we need a historical baseline.  Key pieces of context include:  
• How long Iran has kept the internet in a filtered or whitelisted state after previous nationwide shutdowns (e.g., Nov 2019 fuel protests, Sept 2022 Mahsa Amini protests).  
• Whether NetBlocks (the arbiter in the resolution criteria) has ever reported a complete return to unfiltered access after such crises and, if so, how long it took.  
• Technical or legal changes (National Information Network, DPI upgrades, legislative moves) that influence the government’s ability or willingness to maintain long-term filtering.  
• Statements by Iranian officials about a timeline for restoring full connectivity.  
Gathering this history will give an “outside-view” on restoration likelihood and typical duration of restrictive regimes, which is exactly what forecasters need for this question.
