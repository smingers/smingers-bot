You are currently doing research for historical information on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
Will Iran's Internet not be "heavily filtered/whitelisted" for most users before May 2026?

Question background:
On December 29, 2025, [Iran’s largest protests in three years](https://apnews.com/article/iran-traders-protest-rial-currency-ddc955739fb412b642251dee10638f03) erupted after [the country’s currency plummeted](https://apnews.com/article/iran-gold-silver-jewelry-sales-israel-war-0e774bc3c2fea972ab3225e1864a438e) to a record low against the U.S. dollar, and the head of the Central Bank resigned.&#x20;

Since then [the US President threatened the Iranian government and supported the protesters](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-trump-4e2232877bd1fff11cd80a33db47353d), [the protests escalated and became nationwide](https://apnews.com/video/what-to-know-about-the-protests-in-iran-30bed7d6f14f4865b583c9293df83df2), and [the Iranian theocracy brutally responded to the protesters](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-us-israel-war-economy-54e4024a0b9e6a9f3ab49153c8e28f05).

On January 8, 2026, as tensions rose Iran’s Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi (who has been in exile for almost 50 years) called for demonstrations. [The Iranian theocracy responded that day by shutting down the Internet and phone communications](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-us-israel-war-nuclear-economy-ebddd998fbe7903e70ca62127250ebcb) for the country's population of over 90 million.&#x20;

As [Amnesty International outlines](https://www.amnesty.org.au/everything-you-need-to-know-about-internet-shutdowns/),

> Internet shutdowns pose a threat to human rights because they restrict the ability of important human rights activities to be organised and conducted... but are also in direct violation of a number of human rights laws. The United Nations Human Rights Committee has declared that “states … must not block or hinder internet connectivity in relation to peaceful assemblies.”

On 15 January, 2026, [reports suggested that international web access will not be available until at least the Iranian New Year in late March](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cg5gegrdq3go). [Iran has a long history of Internet censorship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_censorship_in_Iran).

On January 27, 2026, [NetBlocks reported](https://mastodon.social/@netblocks/115967507497404228) "With #Iran's internet shutdown approaching day 20, many networks are becoming visible internationally. HOWEVER: No return to usual: Web still heavily filtered on a whitelist basis. Circumvention still needed: The opening of protocols can enable new workarounds."

This remains the situation as of [NetBlocks update three days later](https://mastodon.social/@netblocks/115985042778046760).&#x20;

The recent events have become ["the bloodiest crackdown on dissent since Iran’s 1979 Islamic Revolution"](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-nationwide-scale-us-trump-0eecd9962240600150530261dfab03f2) with at least 3,117 people killed (although [other estimates are far higher](https://thebulletin.org/2026/01/irans-internet-shutdown-tells-a-larger-story-digital-repression-is-on-the-rise/)). [The economic damage has also been significant](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-crackdown-internet-business-costs-a0bd2df1d13355dcc28f46e5b5b3c893), further exacerbating tensions.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-09. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-09 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic or financial data, add a FRED query. Use a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate") or a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE"). Returns historical data with computed statistics.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one Agent query.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant historical context needed to generate an outside view.}

Search queries:
1. your query here (Google)
2. your query here (Google News)
3. your query here (Agent)
4. economic indicator query (FRED) -- only if question involves economic/financial data
