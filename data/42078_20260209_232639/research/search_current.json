Will Iran's Internet not be \"heavily filtered/whitelisted\" for most users before May 2026?\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Iranians Become Experts at Bypassing Internet Censorship, Drawing Global Attention**\nMassive internet censorship in Iran during protests that began over a month ago has led Iranians to develop sophisticated methods to bypass restrictions. According to Filter.Watch, internet traffic in Iran dropped by 98.5% on January 8, 2024, due to government-imposed outages that targeted both terrestrial connections and previously reliable VPNs like Amnezia, which saw daily users plummet from nearly 90,000 to fewer than 100. The government implemented a 'white list' including safe sites such as Google Meet, Gmail, Outlook, Play Store, App Store, Bing, and other messaging services, while blocking the rest of the global internet. In response, Iranians increasingly turned to Starlink terminals, which use satellites to maintain connectivity. Though difficult to block due to the large number of moving satellites, Starlink experienced packet loss rates of 10\u201340% in some areas. Experts like Mikhail Klimaryov from the Internet Protection Society suggest that Iran is not using electronic warfare but rather enforcing strict laws: possessing a Starlink terminal can result in up to two years in prison, and transmitting videos may be treated as espionage, punishable by death. Despite this, hidden terminals remain hard to detect. For broader coordination, Iranians have adopted mesh networks like the encrypted app Bitchat, which uses Bluetooth to connect devices within a 30-meter radius\u2014proven effective during protests in Nepal, Madagascar, and Uganda. Iranian opposition figures in exile have also launched a similar app, Noghteha. The situation has drawn international attention, especially from observers monitoring Russia\u2019s increasing digital autocracy. On January 27, 2024, Russia\u2019s State Duma advanced a bill allowing the FSB to force telecom providers to suspend services on demand. However, due to Russia\u2019s vast and advanced infrastructure\u2014over 40 international fiber cables\u2014complete isolation is more difficult than in Iran. Russia has created its own 'white list' of approved services, while Iran is developing a sovereign, isolated internet disconnected from the global network.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 06:39 PM\nSource:[Geo.fr](https://www.geo.fr/geopolitique/les-techniques-des-iraniens-pour-contourner-la-censure-attirent-des-yeux-curieux-230818)\n\n**When Internet Censorship Becomes a Weapon: Beyond Dictatorships**\nIn 2024, internet access was suspended in 54 countries, according to RTBF Actus. These suspensions ranged from partial, limited to specific regions, to total, nationwide outages. For example, in January 2024, Iran experienced a nationwide internet blackout. The reasons for such measures vary widely and include suppressing opposition, quelling protests, or disrupting elections. In all cases, the consequences are consistent: citizens lose the ability to access online information, communicate digitally, or use certain websites and platforms.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 05:17 PM\nSource:[RTBF](https://www.rtbf.be/article/iran-birmanie-inde-quand-la-censure-d-internet-devient-une-arme-et-pas-seulement-en-dictature-11675796)\n\n**Why Russia Is Following North Korea\u2019s Path: Whitelist Systems, How They Work, and Ways to Counter Them**\nRussia is shifting from a 'blacklist' model of internet censorship\u2014blocking specific domains and IPs\u2014to a 'whitelist' system, where only explicitly authorized traffic is permitted, mirroring North Korea's isolated digital environment. This transition is driven by the Technical Means of Systematic Control (TSPU), which enables infrastructure-level filtering, including blanket blocking of entire foreign VPS subnets (e.g., Hetzner, OVH, DigitalOcean), disrupting services like Cloudflare and CDNs even for non-banned sites. In North Korea, the 'Kwanm\u0451\u043d' intranet and 'Mirae' Wi-Fi networks require SIM cards and device-level authentication, linking users to government-issued mobile IDs, enabling total surveillance. Russia is moving toward similar integration, using mandatory phone-based Wi-Fi authentication and eSIMs tied to Gosuslugi, with biometric verification for foreigners (and potentially citizens). The system uses dynamic whitelists to grant access based on user identity\u2014e.g., teachers access Wikipedia, officials access closed databases, regular users only G\u043e\u0441\u0443\u0441\u043b\u0443\u0433\u0438 and VK. The Red Star OS in North Korea employs automatic watermarking to trace file distribution via device serial numbers. In Russia, tools like zapret and ByeDPI modify traffic to mimic HTTPS on allowed domains (e.g., vk.com, ya.ru), evading detection. Tor users rely on obfs4 bridges and Snowflake to bypass blocks, though the Roskomnadzor actively hunts bridge IPs. Despite efforts, no universal solution exists due to regional variations in TSPU filtering. The shift to whitelisting is seen as a path toward digital degradation, cloud instability, and reliance on technical workarounds.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 03:53 PM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0440](https://habr.com/ru/articles/994558/)\n\n**Iran's businesses suffer under internet disruption shadow**\nIran's economy has suffered significant setbacks following a 20-day internet shutdown, with reports indicating a 25% to 60% decline in economic activity. Economic forecasts for Iran's fiscal year 1404, initially projecting negative growth, have worsened due to three interrelated threats: internet disruptions, political and foreign policy uncertainties, and stagnating social demand. The Ministry of Communications estimated economic damage during the shutdown at IRR100 trillion ($196 million). International research confirms internet shutdowns can reduce short-term economic activity by up to 25%, with some cases showing declines of 25% to 35%, and up to 60% in extreme instances. The disruption severely impacted digital infrastructure, causing thousands of online businesses to lose access to markets, customers, and revenue, resulting in sharp sales drops, inability to cover expenses, and some complete closures. Beyond direct losses, the shutdown sent a negative signal to investors, increasing perceived policy and operational risks\u2014particularly deterring investment in startups and innovative ventures. Concurrently, political ambiguity, regional tensions, and potential trade restrictions have raised risk premiums in foreign transactions, leading to capital being redirected toward safer assets and reducing productive investment. Combined with chronic inflation and negative public sentiment, these factors have driven down household consumption and effective demand, deepening the recession and creating an uncertain outlook for the labor market. The Minister of Economy previously reported a 650,000 increase in unemployment during the summer months, underscoring the deteriorating economic and employment situation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 01:21 PM\nSource:[bne IntelliNews](https://www.intellinews.com/iran-s-businesses-suffer-under-internet-disruption-shadow-424911/)\n\n**Iran's Digital Surveillance Machine Is Almost Complete**\nIran's government has reportedly advanced its digital surveillance capabilities to near-complete status after more than 15 years of implementing internet controls, including connectivity filtering, digital curfews, and nationwide blackouts. The most recent shutdown, beginning January 8, 2026, lasted for multiple days and unexpectedly disabled even the National Information Network (NIN)\u2014Iran\u2019s state-controlled intranet\u2014despite years of refining a strategy to maintain internal network operations during global internet outages. Researchers from Project Ainita and Holistic Resilience describe the shutdown as impulsive and panic-driven, contrasting with Iran\u2019s previously methodical approach. The NIN, which the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) effectively controls through ownership or shareholder roles in nearly all telecom systems, enables the regime to monitor virtually all domestic communications. Holistic Resilience\u2019s reports detail how Iran\u2019s legal, technical, and infrastructural systems are designed to centralize data collection and facilitate mass surveillance, with support from state-affiliated entities and hackers. The shutdown\u2019s unintended collapse of the NIN raises concerns about the regime\u2019s stability and future digital control strategies, as it temporarily eliminated both external connectivity and internal surveillance capacity.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 11:00 AM\nSource:[Wired](https://www.wired.com/story/irans-digital-surveillance-machine-is-almost-complete/)\n\n**Kremlin May Cut Off Russians' Internet and Phone Access Over One Reason, Handing FSB the 'Leverage'**\nOn February 8, 2026, it was reported that the Kremlin has prepared a mechanism to block internet and telecommunications services for Russian citizens in response to a so-called 'threat to security,' granting broad powers to the FSB. The law, passed by the State Duma on January 27, 2026, allows security agencies to disconnect mobile and landline internet, phone lines, and all communication services upon their discretion. According to a report published by the UK Ministry of Defence on X, telecom operators must comply with FSB orders to disconnect services, and are exempt from liability for customer complaints. The law\u2019s definition of 'communication services' is broad, covering not only internet and phone lines but also voice and text messages and image transmission. Russia has previously tested this system abroad, notably assisting Iran in building a censorship infrastructure capable of blocking the internet, VPNs, and most online applications to monitor protest organizers and participants. Additionally, starting September 1, 2026, Rosfinmonitoring (the financial intelligence agency) will gain full access to all payment data, enabling security forces to freeze or confiscate citizens\u2019 funds for any alleged violations.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 06:09 PM\nSource:[\u0414\u0438\u0430\u043b\u043e\u0433.UA](https://www.dialog.ua/russia/328433_1770572553)\n\n**Internet Control in Russia: FSB Granted Unprecedented Power to Disconnect Communications**\nAccording to intelligence from British sources, on January 27, 2026, the Russian State Duma approved government-backed amendments allowing the FSB to implement mass disconnections of mobile and fixed-line internet, telephone services, and other communication means in response to 'security threats.' The proposed legislation mandates telecom operators to immediately cease services upon receiving an order and exempts them from financial liability for resulting outages. The British intelligence report highlights that the broad definition of 'communication services' effectively grants the FSB unprecedented control over all data transmission, including voice, text, images, and internet traffic. This move aligns with Russia\u2019s broader trend of intensifying state control over its information space, particularly since the full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022. The report also notes that Russia not only strengthens internal surveillance but actively exports censorship technologies abroad, including assisting Iran in developing one of the most advanced internet control systems\u2014capable of deep packet inspection, app restrictions, VPN blocking, and real-time monitoring of protest organizers.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 12:48 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a-\u0423\u043a\u0440\u0430\u0438\u043d\u0430](https://www.rbc.ua/ukr/news/rubilnik-rukah-fsb-rosiyi-zaprovadzhuyut-1770554929.html)\n\n**Germany Joins US, India, Poland, China, Italy, Canada, And More Nations In Issuing Historic Alarm-Bell 'Do Not Travel' Warnings For Iran Amid Escalating Unrest, Nightmare Mass Cancellations, And Rising Geopolitical Tensions - Travel And Tour World**\nGermany has joined the United States, India, Poland, China, Italy, Canada, and other nations in issuing historic 'Do Not Travel' warnings for Iran due to escalating unrest, violent protests, government crackdowns, and rising geopolitical tensions. The warnings, published on February 8, 2026, reflect a severe deterioration in security conditions, with mass cancellations of flights, airlines rerouting or suspending services, and stricter visa policies implemented by Iran. The unrest, which began in late 2025 amid economic hardship, inflation, and political dissatisfaction, has led to nationwide demonstrations met with live ammunition and mass arrests. International advisories emphasize the dangers to both locals and foreigners, citing arbitrary detentions, internet shutdowns, and unpredictable security environments. As a result, Iran's tourism industry\u2014once supported by historical landmarks like Persepolis and Isfahan\u2019s mosques\u2014has suffered a catastrophic decline, with hotels, restaurants, and souvenir shops struggling. The crisis is compounded by the devaluation of the rial, soaring unemployment, and regional military tensions with Israel and the U.S. The article notes that recovery will require political reform, improved security, and restored international trust, but until then, travel to Iran remains highly restricted and risky.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 10:37 AM\nSource:[Travel And Tour World](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/germany-joins-us-india-poland-china-italy-canada-and-more-nations-in-issuing-historic-alarm-bell-do-not-travel-warnings-for-iran-amid-escalating-unrest-nightmare-mass-cancella/)\n\n**U.S. Urges Americans in Iran to Leave Amid Diplomatic Talks and Security Concerns**\nThe United States has urged American citizens in Iran to leave the country immediately or, if unsafe, to remain low-profile and maintain constant contact with family and friends due to heightened security measures, road closures, public transport disruptions, and internet blackouts.

Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi stated the talks began well after an eight-month pause caused by the June 2025 Israel-Iran conflict, which created distrust. He emphasized that progress depends on follow-up consultations in capitals and warned Iran is prepared to defend its sovereignty and national security against any excessive demands or adventurism from the U.S. The U.S. delegation was led by Special Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner, Trump\u2019s son-in-law. China expressed support for Iran, opposing unilateral intimidation and affirming its backing for Iran\u2019s sovereignty, dignity, and legitimate rights, with senior diplomats meeting in Beijing to discuss the situation.

The U.S. embassy in Iran stated that heightened security measures, road closures, public transportation disruptions, and internet outages have created conditions that may endanger safety. According to the embassy's official statement, Iran continues to restrict access to mobile and landline networks and the national internet, while airlines are further reducing or canceling flights to and from Iran. American citizens are advised to expect ongoing internet disruptions, plan for alternative communication methods, and consider exiting Iran by land to Armenia or Turkey if conditions permit.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 03:29 AM\nSource:[AL Masry Al Youm](https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/4192573)\n\n**Iran\u2019s Internet Blackout and the Digital Solidarity of Conduit: A Lifeline Amid State Censorship**\nIn response to severe internet restrictions in Iran, which began on January 8 and remained largely in place through early 2026, thousands of volunteers abroad have used the 'Conduit' application to help Iranian users bypass censorship. Conduit enables users outside Iran to share portions of their internet bandwidth with users inside Iran, allowing access to the global internet through small, open 'gaps' in state-imposed filters\u2014such as those maintained by banks, state institutions, and certain CDNs. Unlike traditional VPNs, which rely on fixed servers and fail under total internet shutdowns, Conduit routes traffic dynamically through a constantly changing network of volunteer nodes, making IP-based blocking more difficult. According to Psiphon, Iran became the country with the highest number of Conduit users, with over 11 million connections recorded in a single day on January 31, 2026\u2014up from 4 million just three days prior. This digital solidarity has enabled many Iranians to reconnect via WhatsApp and Telegram and resume social media activity. Despite partial restoration of international connectivity by mid-April 2024, access remains highly restricted, uneven, and filtered. The 'whitelist' system grants unrestricted access only to state entities, while ordinary users face heavy filtering and frequent disconnections. Iran's Interior Ministry\u2019s Security Deputy Ali Ekber Pur-Cem\u015fidiyan stated that national security, not economic concerns, takes priority in restoring internet access. Experts warn of a permanent 'layered internet' structure emerging, where access is determined by user status. The government banned Starlink antennas during protests, eliminating satellite internet access. Iran\u2019s Communications Minister Sattar Hashemi reported daily economic losses of approximately 50 trillion riyals due to the outage, citing disruptions to banking, government services, and international trade, with some companies filing for bankruptcy and workers laid off.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 08:56 AM\nSource:[euronews](https://tr.euronews.com/next/2026/01/31/iranda-internet-engeline-karsi-disaridan-dayanisma-conduit-nedir)\n\n**Iran\u2019s Partial Internet Restoration Amid Expansion of Digital Isolation via 'Whitelist' System**\nInternet service in Iran has been partially restored after approximately 20 days of a nationwide blackout imposed by the government to suppress widespread anti-government protests. According to internet monitoring experts from NetBlocks and Kentik, partial data traffic has resumed, but access remains severely restricted. The government is advancing long-term plans to establish a 'new era of digital isolation' through a 'whitelist' system that allows only individuals with special security clearance\u2014such as government officials, journalists, or approved entities\u2014to access the global internet. Others are restricted to Iran\u2019s national intranet, where online activity is heavily monitored and censored. This marks a strategic shift from previous tactics of blocking specific websites and apps\u2014such as Instagram, banned after the 2022 protests over Mahsa Amini\u2019s death, and Telegram, banned after 2018 protests\u2014toward systemic digital exclusion. Experts, including Amir Rashidi of the human rights organization Mian, warn that internet disruptions in Iran rarely result in full restoration of pre-cutoff conditions. Data traffic patterns remain highly fragmented, suggesting the implementation of a new filtering system that is not yet capable of handling the full load, as noted by Doug Madouri of Kentik. The partial restoration is not a sign of liberalization but rather a move toward institutionalized digital control.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 09:47 AM\nSource:[CNN Arabic](https://arabic.cnn.com/middle-east/article/2026/01/30/the-future-of-irans-internet-connectivity-still-bleak-even-as-blackout-begins-to-lift)\n\n**Iran Plans Permanent Disconnect from Global Internet, Restricting Access to State-Approved Users**\nIran is reportedly planning to permanently disconnect from the global internet, according to a report by Filterwatch, an organization monitoring internet censorship in Iran. The plan aims to restrict international internet access to a state-privileged status, allowing only citizens who have undergone government security checks or hold access to classified information to gain entry to a filtered version of the global internet. The rest of the population will be limited to a national intranet, an isolated domestic network disconnected from the global internet. This move follows the initial internet blackout on January 8, 2026, triggered by the escalation of anti-government protests. Authorities stated that international internet access will remain restricted at least until March 20, 2026, the date of the Persian New Year (Nowruz). Researchers from Project Ainita and Outline Foundation note that the new 'whitelist' system may be implemented using Chinese-exported technologies, including intermediate devices capable of monitoring and manipulating internet traffic. These tools enable state surveillance, block access to specific websites, and disable VPNs. Iran has been developing its national internet network since 2009 to prevent total internet shutdowns during mass protests. The government offers tax incentives to internet providers who relocate their infrastructure within the country, thereby strengthening state control over digital space.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 19, 2026 06:28 AM\nSource:[inbusiness.kz](https://inbusiness.kz/ru/last/iran-planiruet-navsegda-otklyuchitsya-ot-globalnogo-interneta)\n\n**Iran Tightens Internet Control, Plans Permanent 'Cyberwall' from 2026**\nIran has reportedly implemented partial restoration of internet services following a nationwide shutdown that began on January 8, 2026, after renewed protests. However, according to a report by the monitoring organization Filterwatch, the Iranian government is planning a permanent 'internet blackout' strategy. The plan, described as a classified initiative, would make internet access a government-privileged status: only individuals who pass official security\u5ba1\u67e5 can access a filtered version of the global internet, while the general public would be restricted to a closed domestic network. The report cites Iranian sources and references statements from state media and government officials suggesting this shift is permanent, with no return to unrestricted internet access expected after 2026. The government aims to enforce this through two mechanisms: a 'whitelist' system that allows only pre-approved IP addresses to access designated servers, and the use of high-capacity 'middleboxes' to monitor, manipulate, and block traffic\u2014including specific websites and virtual private network (VPN) tools. Additionally, citizens would be restricted to government-developed domestic platforms for messaging, search engines, and streaming services. The internet blackout, which lasted longer than Egypt's 2011 shutdown during the Arab Spring, was initially announced to last until at least March 20, 2026, the Persian New Year.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 17, 2026 08:30 PM\nSource:[\u5373\u6642\u65b0\u805e instant news](https://news.mingpao.com/pns/%e5%9c%8b%e9%9a%9b/article/20260118/s00014/1768669738361/%e4%bc%8a%e6%9c%97%e6%94%b6%e7%b7%8a%e7%9b%a3%e6%8e%a7-%e6%93%ac%e6%b0%b8%e4%b9%85%e3%80%8c%e5%b0%81%e7%b6%b2%e3%80%8d)\n\n**Iran Plans Permanent Internet Shutdown: 'White List' for Privileged Access**\nIran is reportedly developing a plan to permanently disable international internet access, replacing it with a closed intranet system accessible only to individuals on a government-approved 'white list' of security-certified users. This initiative, referred to as 'Absolute Digital Isolation' by digital rights group Filterwatch, follows widespread protests that began on December 28, 2025, due to economic hardship and escalated into mass anti-government demonstrations. According to humanitarian organizations, nearly 2,900 protesters were killed by security forces, and dozens died in custody. Internet activity in Iran has dropped to approximately 2% of normal levels. The government has already shut down international internet access since January 8, 2026, with officials stating it will remain offline at least until the March 20 Nouruz holiday. State media and government spokesmen have signaled this is a permanent shift. Those not on the 'white list' would only have access to Iran\u2019s isolated national internet, a system developed since 2009. Protest activity has reportedly quieted, but security forces continue patrolling cities like Tehran, with drones operating overhead. The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has issued a warning to airlines against flying in Iranian airspace due to heightened risks from air defense systems and ongoing political-military tensions, citing potential for misidentification of aircraft and possible U.S. military intervention.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: January 17, 2026 12:24 PM\nSource:[gazetapl](https://wiadomosci.gazeta.pl/swiat/7,198075,32534979,wladze-iranu-na-stale-wylacza-internet-ma-powstac-biala-lista.html)\n\n**Iran Plans Permanent Internet Blackout, Restricting Access to a Censored Global Network**\nIran is preparing to make its internet blackout permanent, restricting access to a filtered version of the global internet only to individuals authorized by the government, according to Filterwatch, an NGO monitoring online censorship in Iran, as reported by The Guardian. Amir Rashidi, the NGO's director, stated that a classified plan is being developed to turn global internet access into a 'government privilege.' State media have confirmed the ongoing transformation, indicating that unrestricted internet access will not be available even after 2026. Authorized individuals must pass government security checks to access the filtered global internet, while ordinary citizens will be limited to Iran's domestic, isolated network. The current internet blockade began on January 8, 2026, following 12 days of escalating anti-regime protests that started on December 28, 2025. The government has previously used 'whitelisting'\u2014a practice restricting access to a curated list of websites\u2014likely enabled by components imported from China. This blockade is one of the most severe in history, lasting longer than Egypt\u2019s 2011 internet shutdown during the Tahrir Square protests. A government spokesperson told Iranian media that the international internet will remain blocked at least until Nowruz, the Persian New Year, typically around March 20.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 17, 2026 10:03 AM\nSource:[Il Fatto Quotidiano](https://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2026/01/17/blocco-internet-iran-regime-censura-news/8259571/)\n\n**Iran Plans Permanent Global Internet Disconnection, Restricting Access to State-Approved Users**\nA report by the internet censorship monitoring group Filterwatch, cited by the UK's Guardian on January 17, 2026, reveals that the Iranian government is pursuing a secret plan to permanently disconnect Iran from the global internet and restrict online access exclusively to individuals approved by the state. The plan, which aims to transition international internet access into a government-controlled privilege, has been signaled by state media and officials who warn that unrestricted access will not return after 2026. This follows Iran's previous 2009 internet shutdown during mass anti-government protests, which caused significant damage to both state and public operations. Since then, Iran has spent 16 years building a closed national intranet. Under the new plan, only those who pass government security checks or surveillance will gain limited access to the global internet through a sophisticated 'whitelist' system. The general population will be restricted to a state-controlled national internet, where only specially developed tools\u2014such as government-approved messaging apps, search engines, and navigation systems\u2014are accessible, with all traffic under strict monitoring. Additionally, the Iranian government is actively deploying Deep Packet Inspection (DPI) updates via security firms to detect and block VPN traffic from Starlink satellite internet. The government has already shut down internet access since August 8 amid rising anti-government protests. Filterwatch, citing Iranian government sources, predicts the shutdown will continue until the Persian New Year on March 20, 2026, with no restoration of global connectivity afterward. A former U.S. State Department official described the plan as 'plausible and terrifying,' noting it would entail massive economic and cultural costs and could represent a dangerous overreach by the regime, potentially beyond its capacity to manage.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: January 17, 2026 09:37 AM\nSource:[First-Class \uacbd\uc81c\uc2e0\ubb38 \ud30c\uc774\ub0b8\uc15c\ub274\uc2a4](https://www.fnnews.com/news/202601171837565320)\n\n**Iran Implements New Plan to Restrict Global Internet Access, With China's Surveillance Tech as Key Enabler**\nIran is reportedly implementing a secret plan to permanently disconnect from the global internet and restrict access to only individuals who pass strict security vetting by the government, according to the Guardian, citing Iranian internet rights activists and the monitoring organization Filter Watch. Under this plan, internet access to the global web would become a government-issued 'security privilege,' available only to a limited group after passing official checks. The remaining population would be restricted to Iran's national intranet\u2014a largely isolated, domestic network. This move follows a prolonged internet blackout that began on January 8, 2026, after 12 days of intensified anti-government protests, which activists claim led to the deaths of thousands, though protest activity later declined. The blackout is described as the longest in Iran\u2019s history and has severely limited information flow from within the country. Iranian state media and officials have indicated that international internet access will remain severed until at least Nowruz (Persian New Year) on March 20, 2026. The system relies on a 'whitelist' model, where only approved users can access the global internet. Experts, including researchers from the EyeNet and OutLine projects, suggest that the surveillance infrastructure enabling this control was likely imported from China, using high-capacity monitoring devices embedded in telecom networks. These systems allow real-time surveillance, blocking of websites and protocols, and disruption of virtual private networks (VPNs), effectively enabling the government to block communications in both directions. Iran\u2019s national intranet offers a limited set of state-approved services\u2014including messaging, search engines, navigation apps, and a local video streaming platform\u2014each tightly monitored and disconnected from the global internet.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 17, 2026 06:44 AM\nSource:[Dostor](https://www.dostor.org/5383994)\n\n**US Gets 60 Countries to Sign 'Declaration for the Future of the Internet'**\nOn April 29, 2022, the United States led the signing of the 'Declaration for the Future of the Internet' with 60 countries, including Argentina, Australia, all European Union members, Canada, Israel, Japan, Kenya, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and Ukraine, as well as the European Commission. The declaration commits signatories to maintaining an 'open, free, global, interoperable, reliable, and secure' internet. It calls for refraining from government-imposed internet shutdowns, blocking lawful content, and degrading domestic internet access. The document also condemns the use of surveillance tools for social scoring or pre-crime detention, opposes cybercrime and disinformation campaigns, and promotes affordable, inclusive, and reliable internet access. Notably absent from the list is India, the world\u2019s leading internet-shutdown offender, according to Access Now. The White House expressed hope that India might still join, while Access Now reported India with 16 internet shutdowns, followed by Myanmar (15), Iran and Sudan (5 each), and others. Niger is the only country to appear on both the shutdown list and the declaration, having conducted one shutdown in the past year.\nOriginal language: unknown\nPublish date: April 29, 2022 01:23 PM\nSource:[pcmag.com](https://pcmag.com/news/us-gets-60-countries-to-sign-declaration-for-the-future-of-the-internet)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
