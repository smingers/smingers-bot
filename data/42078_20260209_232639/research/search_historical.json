By Saturday (early December 2025), the price of a gold coin exceeded 1.2 billion rials for the first time in Iran's history.\n\n- **Currency exchange rate:** The rial now trades at over 1 million to $1.\n\n- **Gold sales volume:** One merchant (Mansour, 28) reported selling 6 kilos (13.2 pounds) of gold to ordinary people in two weeks, describing this as unprecedented demand.\n\n- **Other asset prices (summer 2025):** Gold coins were over $1,000; 1-kilogram silver ingots were nearly $2,000.\n\n- **Population movement during 12-day war:** Tens of thousands of Iranians living in Tehran fled the capital during the 12-day war with Israel, heading to the countryside or the Caspian Sea coast. Some areas were overwhelmed by newcomers, and ATMs ran out of cash or became nonfunctional.\n\n- **Historical context:** During the 1979 Islamic Revolution, the rial hit an all-time high of 120 to $1.\n\n## Key Context:\n\nThe article describes Iranians rushing to purchase \"value-preserving assets\" including gold, silver, diamonds, cryptocurrencies, and foreign currency as hedges against inflation, sanctions, and the weakening rial. This behavior is driven by:\n\n1. Economic pressures from international sanctions\n2. Fear of another war with Israel following a recent 12-day conflict\n3. Reports of mass layoffs stemming from electricity problems, consumer demand issues, and sanctions\n4. U.S. crackdowns on Iranian crypto-sellers\n5. The need for portable wealth that can be easily carried in case of crisis\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\nMultiple unnamed individuals are quoted (using only first names or partial identification \"for fear of reprisals\"):\n\n- **Mansour (28, gold merchant):** Described unprecedented demand, with people rushing to buy because they fear savings will lose value\n- **Behzad Rashvand (57, grandfather):** Views gold as the only protection against rampant inflation\n- **Amir Ramezani (top gold trader in Tehran):** Reports that well-to-do families are selling assets to maintain their lifestyle as incomes no longer match their established standard of living\n- **Ahmad (49, fabric importer):** Plans to convert all liquid assets into foreign currency and gold, stating \"In an emergency, I need to be able to carry my assets with me if I have to leave\"\n\nThe article notes that wealthier investors are turning to diamonds and gemstones as discreet, portable stores of value, with jewelers in Tehran and Mashhad reporting rising demand.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-trump-4e2232877bd1fff11cd80a33db47353d\">\n# Summary of AP News Article (January 2, 2026)\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n- **Death toll**: At least 8 people killed in violence surrounding the demonstrations (as of this article's date)\n- **Protest duration**: Sixth day of protests (starting around December 29, 2025)\n- **Geographic scope**: Demonstrations reached over 100 locations in 22 of Iran's 31 provinces (according to U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency)\n- **Currency situation**: $1 = approximately 1.4 million rials\n- **Scale comparison**: Described as \"the biggest in Iran since 2022\" (Mahsa Amini protests), but \"yet to be as widespread and intense as those surrounding the death of Amini\"\n\n## Key Events:\n- President Trump posted on Truth Social warning Iran against \"violently killing peaceful protesters,\" stating the U.S. is \"locked and loaded and ready to go\"\n- Iranian officials (Ali Larijani and Ali Shamkhani) issued counter-threats warning against U.S. intervention\n- Iran's U.N. envoy sent a letter to the U.N.

The article notes estimates vary.\n- **Starlink cost:** Terminals cost about $2,000 on the black market\n- **Historical comparison:** This shutdown was the longest in Iranian history \u2013 nearly two weeks longer than the 2019 internet shutdown\n- **Economic cost of 2019 shutdown:** Former head of Iran's Chamber of Commerce estimated it cost $1.5 billion\n\n## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):\n\n**Amir Rashidi** (cybersecurity expert, director of digital rights and security at Miaan Group):\n- \"Every time we have an internet shutdown in Iran, usually we don't go back to normal\"\n- States the Iranian government has made strides toward implementing \"whitelisting\" technology that allows only people with security clearance to access the international web\n- \"We do believe they're going to rapidly move into the direction of implementing that policy\u2026 the infrastructure exists\"\n- Believes the Iranian government will \"invest more in controlling satellite internet\" in the future\n\n**Doug Madory** (director of internet analysis at Kentik):\n- Described internet traffic patterns as \"very jagged\" since partial restoration\n- Speculated \"maybe a new traffic filtering system has been installed and can't keep up\"\n\n**Mahsa Alimardani** (associate director of technology threats and opportunities at Witness):\n- Described Iran's population as \"one of the most sophisticated in the world when it comes to circumventing web restrictions\"\n- \"What is really becoming a game changer is the fact that we can have connectivity that does not depend on sovereignty\"\n- Noted some Iranian regime efforts to disrupt Starlink signals using electronic warfare tools are \"believed to be exaggerated by the regime, as it tries to deter more people from buying satellite internet\"\n- \"I don't think within the regime itself they even know what direction they're going to go\"\n\n**Antonio Cesarano** (lead product manager for Proton VPN):\n- Confirmed that on January 8, the blackout cut off Proton VPN's user base in Iran\n- \"What we've been observing in the last year or so is that people prepare themselves\u2026 people have probably multiple VPNs\"\n\n## Key Technical Details:\n\n**NetBlocks statement (Wednesday, approximately January 29, 2026):**\n- \"Most ordinary users still face heavy filtering and intermittent service under a whitelist system despite a significant increase in internationally visible networks and datacenters\"\n\n**Whitelisting vs. Blacklisting:**\n- Whitelisting involves a small subset of users being cleared to have unrestricted access to international internet (via special SIM cards or permissions)\n- Everyone else is censored and forced to rely on the national internet where the regime can track users and block unapproved websites\n- This represents a shift from Iran's longstanding tactic of blacklisting specific websites and apps\n\n**Historical context of censorship:**\n- Instagram was blocked after the 2022 internet shutdown\n- Telegram was banned following 2018 protests\n\n**Circumvention tools:**\n- Starlink (made free in Iran by Elon Musk's company)\n- VPNs (historically funded by US government, though Trump administration cut funding last year)\n- Iranian government is cracking down on Starlink users with arrests and prison sentences for possession\n\n**Economic factors:**\n- Iran's isolation makes broad censorship easier (no international credit cards, no foreign services like Netflix, Uber, or Amazon)\n- However, there are still economic stakeholders within the regime who benefit from internet access\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.rferl.org/a/it-expert-iran-internet-blackout-alimanardi/33663712.html\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Mahsa Alimardani: To Help Countries Like Iran, We Need To Scale Up Starlink\"\n\n**Source:** RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty  \n**Date:** January 29, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Observations:\n\n### Current Internet Status (as of January 28-29, 2026):\n- **NetBlocks reported on January 28** that most regular Internet users still face heavy filtering and only intermittent service under a whitelist system, despite a significant increase in internationally visible networks and datacenters\n- Iranians are slowly managing to get online using anti-filtering tools\n- There has been an increase in connectivity over the Iranian network in recent days, but it's unstable and not consistent\n- The shutdown continues in large parts, though there is a \"bigger window\" of access\n- More people are getting online using proxy servers, but connectivity \"comes and goes\"\n\n### Expert Opinion - Mahsa Alimardani:\n**Background:** Associate director for the Technology Threats and Opportunities program at WITNESS; has been studying information controls and Internet access for over a decade; recently spoke at World Economic Forum side event in Davos about Iran's Internet restrictions\n\n**Key Points:**\n\n1. **Precedent:** While there are precedents globally for longer Internet shutdowns (e.g., Kashmir by Indian government), Iran has broken its own record for longest Internet shutdown\n\n2. **Starlink as Solution:**\n   - Small amounts of information during the shutdown came out through Starlink satellite terminals smuggled into Iran\n   - Current market value: **$2,000 per Starlink terminal** (not realistic for a country in economic crisis)\n   - This represents \"very privileged and inaccessible type of Internet\"\n   - Alimardani is working on scaling satellite Internet for potentially 90 million people\n\n3. **Coalition Effort:**\n   - Campaign called \"direct 2 sell\" (direct2sell.org)\n   - Coalition includes: WITNESS, Access Now, For Human Rights (CHRI), strategic litigation project, and Article 19\n   - Goal is to scale satellite Internet beyond current limited Starlink access\n\n4. **Assessment of International Response:**\n   - Countries need to do more than \"symbolic statements and condemnations\"\n   - Real investment needed in connectivity and documentation efforts\n   - Human rights sector has been \"decimated through cuts to development agencies\"\n\n5. **Broader Context:**\n   - Traditional Internet access governed by \"digital sovereignty\" through national infrastructure\n   - This framework is \"very harmful\" in authoritarian contexts\n   - Need to \"revolutionize and rethink\" traditional means of Internet access\n   - Referenced academic Azadeh Akbari (professor in Europe) who wrote about breaking the notion of digital sovereignty given Iran's example\n\n**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off at the end.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/2026/jan/28/iran-appears-to-ease-internet-blackout\">\n# Summary of \"Iran appears to ease internet blackout as cost of shutdown mounts\"\n\n**Key Facts and Statistics:**\n\n- Iranian authorities have partially relaxed internet restrictions, but have not fully removed them\n- Internet traffic to Iran reached approximately 60% of pre-shutdown levels at one point (as of Tuesday, January 27, 2026)\n- The internet shutdown is costing Iranian authorities up to $36 million per day, according to a recent estimate by a government minister\n- The shutdown began on January 8, 2026\n- Previously unavailable Iranian Telegram channels came back online on Wednesday (January 28, 2026)\n\n**Expert Opinions (Named Sources):**\n\n- **Doug Madory, Director of Internet Analysis at Kentik**: Described connectivity as \"a real patchwork\" with \"some kind of degraded service\" for most users who have access.

Also collect official Iranian statements on restoration timelines.\nDrawing on the additional material retrieved, the picture that can be documented with primary-source citations for the 2019 and 2022 protest cycles is now as follows.\n\nI. November 2019 nationwide shutdown (\u201cfuel-price protests\u201d)\n\n1. Onset, depth and first reconnection  \n   \u2022 NetBlocks recorded fixed-line and mobile connectivity collapsing to 7 % of ordinary levels within hours of 16 Nov 2019, 18:45 local time (IFJ, 18 Nov 2019).  \n   \u2022 No new dataset contradicts the previously-established timeline: near-total blackout from the evening of 16 Nov to the morning of 21 Nov.\n\n2. Progressive recovery and end-point  \n   \u2022 Al-Jazeera\u2019s Tehran dispatch of 27 Nov 2019 reported that \u201cconnectivity started being restored late last week\u201d and that, by 27 Nov, Iranians were \u201cgetting their digital lives back on track\u201d after a \u201cnearly seven-day long blackout\u201d (Al-Jazeera, 27 Nov 2019).  \n   \u2022 The article cites NetBlocks\u2019 figure of \u201c5 percent for several days\u201d at the apex but, like all other located coverage, presents the restoration in descriptive terms; there is still no quotation of a NetBlocks tweet or bulletin declaring that the network had \u201creturned to normal.\u201d\n\n3. Iranian official statements on restoration  \n   \u2022 ICT Minister Mohammad-Javad Azari-Jahromi told state TV on 18 Nov 2019 that the blackout would be lifted \u201csoon\u201d while emphasising that critical services had migrated to the National Information Network (CNN citation repeated in IFJ piece, 18 Nov 2019).  \n   \u2022 Interior-ministry announcements of a province-by-province plan are referenced in secondary sources but remain elusive in primary form; they are therefore still a gap.\n\n4. NetBlocks language  \n   \u2022 Despite extensive press quoting of NetBlocks\u2019 percentage metrics between 21 \u2013 27 Nov, none of the retrieved texts contains the phrase \u201cinternet returned to normal\u201d or similar wording attributed to NetBlocks.\n\nII. September\u2013October 2022 disruptions (\u201cWomen, Life, Freedom\u201d protests)\n\n1. Nature of the restrictions  \n   \u2022 NetBlocks documented \u201ccurfew-style mobile internet disruptions\u201d starting 21 Sep 2022; these combined nightly nationwide mobile cuts with daytime throttling and the permanent blocking of WhatsApp and Instagram.  \n   \u2022 Freedom House\u2019s 2022 country report confirms that \u201cauthorities blocked access to WhatsApp and Instagram, disrupted internet and mobile services, and violently cracked down on protesters\u201d (Freedom House, 2022).\n\n2. End-date of filtering / resumption of connectivity  \n   \u2022 None of the new sources gives a specific day on which the nightly mobile-data cuts stopped. Freedom House\u2019s narrative, compiled mid-2023, still describes the blocks as ongoing.  \n   \u2022 Consequently, the total duration until full nationwide connectivity (as opposed to partial daytime service) resumed cannot yet be documented.\n\n3. Iranian government timelines  \n   \u2022 No contemporaneous quotation from Communications Minister Eisa Zarepour promising a restoration date has been located. International coverage instead cites him as saying restrictions would last \u201cas long as security considerations require\u201d (Freedom House, 2022). This remains an unclosed gap.\n\n4. NetBlocks wording  \n   \u2022 As with 2019, no article or dataset retrieved to date quotes NetBlocks stating that service had \u201creturned to normal\u201d after October 2022. On the contrary, later retrospectives (CNN, 30 Jan 2026) stress that \u201cevery time we have an internet shutdown in Iran, usually we don\u2019t go back to normal.\u201d\n\nIII. 2026 (contextual corroboration)\n\nNetBlocks\u2019 commentary during the January 2026 blackout explicitly rejected any notion of normalisation, observing that \u201cmost ordinary users still face heavy filtering \u2026 under a whitelist system\u201d even after partial traffic returned (CNN, 30 Jan 2026; IranIntl, 18 Jan 2026). This negative evidence reinforces the inference that NetBlocks avoids the \u201creturned to normal\u201d formulation in its Iran coverage.\n\nIV. Consolidated answers to the original research questions\n\n\u2022 Duration of the 2019 shutdown until filtering ended: near-total blackout 16 Nov \u2013 21 Nov 2019 (~5 days), followed by phased reconnection that was largely complete by 27 Nov 2019 (IFJ; Al-Jazeera).  \n\u2022 Duration of the 2022 restrictions: precise end-point still unverified; NetBlocks bulletins confirm nightly mobile cuts from 21 Sep 2022 into early October, and Freedom House notes that platform blocks (Instagram, WhatsApp) remained in place well after protests subsided.  \n\u2022 Instances of NetBlocks saying the internet \u201creturned to normal\u201d: none found across 2019, 2022 or 2026 material. The phrase appears only in journalists\u2019 paraphrases or in other countries\u2019 contexts.  \n\u2022 Official Iranian statements on restoration timelines:  \n  \u2013 2019: ICT Minister Azari-Jahromi (18 Nov 2019) promised the blackout would end \u201csoon\u201d but gave no firm date (IFJ, 18 Nov 2019). Interior-ministry scheduling remains uncollected.  \n  \u2013 2022: No primary-source commitment located; Zarepour is cited only for saying restrictions would continue \u201cas long as security considerations require\u201d (Freedom House, 2022).\n\nV. Remaining information gaps\n\n1. Primary NetBlocks tweets or blog posts (24 \u2013 27 Nov 2019) that show the exact percentage jump above 90 % and might definitively mark the end of the 2019 filtering.  \n2. Any NetBlocks bulletin or tweet in which the organisation itself states, affirms or denies that connectivity \u201creturned to normal.\u201d A comprehensive negative result would be valuable evidence.  \n3.
