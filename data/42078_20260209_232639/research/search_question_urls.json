By Saturday (early December 2025), the price of a gold coin exceeded 1.2 billion rials for the first time in Iran's history.\n\n- **Currency exchange rate:** The rial now trades at over 1 million to $1.\n\n- **Gold sales volume:** One merchant (Mansour, 28) reported selling 6 kilos (13.2 pounds) of gold to ordinary people in two weeks, describing this as unprecedented demand.\n\n- **Other asset prices (summer 2025):** Gold coins were over $1,000; 1-kilogram silver ingots were nearly $2,000.\n\n- **Population movement during 12-day war:** Tens of thousands of Iranians living in Tehran fled the capital during the 12-day war with Israel, heading to the countryside or the Caspian Sea coast.

This behavior is driven by:\n\n1. Economic pressures from international sanctions\n2. Fear of another war with Israel following a recent 12-day conflict\n3. Reports of mass layoffs stemming from electricity problems, consumer demand issues, and sanctions\n4. U.S. crackdowns on Iranian crypto-sellers\n5. The need for portable wealth that can be easily carried in case of crisis\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\nMultiple unnamed individuals are quoted (using only first names or partial identification \"for fear of reprisals\"):\n\n- **Mansour (28, gold merchant):** Described unprecedented demand, with people rushing to buy because they fear savings will lose value\n- **Behzad Rashvand (57, grandfather):** Views gold as the only protection against rampant inflation\n- **Amir Ramezani (top gold trader in Tehran):** Reports that well-to-do families are selling assets to maintain their lifestyle as incomes no longer match their established standard of living\n- **Ahmad (49, fabric importer):** Plans to convert all liquid assets into foreign currency and gold, stating \"In an emergency, I need to be able to carry my assets with me if I have to leave\"\n\nThe article notes that wealthier investors are turning to diamonds and gemstones as discreet, portable stores of value, with jewelers in Tehran and Mashhad reporting rising demand.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-trump-4e2232877bd1fff11cd80a33db47353d\">\n# Summary of AP News Article (January 2, 2026)\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n- **Death toll**: At least 8 people killed in violence surrounding the demonstrations (as of this article's date)\n- **Protest duration**: Sixth day of protests (starting around December 29, 2025)\n- **Geographic scope**: Demonstrations reached over 100 locations in 22 of Iran's 31 provinces (according to U.S.-based Human Rights Activists News Agency)\n- **Currency situation**: $1 = approximately 1.4 million rials\n- **Scale comparison**: Described as \"the biggest in Iran since 2022\" (Mahsa Amini protests), but \"yet to be as widespread and intense as those surrounding the death of Amini\"\n\n## Key Events:\n- President Trump posted on Truth Social warning Iran against \"violently killing peaceful protesters,\" stating the U.S. is \"locked and loaded and ready to go\"\n- Iranian officials (Ali Larijani and Ali Shamkhani) issued counter-threats warning against U.S. intervention\n- Iran's U.N. envoy sent a letter to the U.N.
