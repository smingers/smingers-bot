Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**BBC Sport (Feb 4, 2026)**: High-quality investigative journalism identifying 4 specific AIN athletes with alleged pro-war connections: Gumennik (figure skating), Korostelev (cross-country), Korzhova (speed skating), Nepryaeva (cross-country). Factual evidence includes social media activity, training in occupied Crimea, and military club affiliations. Expert opinion from Ukrainian flag-bearer Heraskevych (identifiable source) questions neutrality. IOC and World Gymnastics provided official responses. Date: 10 days before current date.

**CBS Sports (Feb 6, 2026)**: Factual summary of AIN participation. Key facts: 20 total athletes (13 Russian, 7 Belarusian) across 8 sports. Highlights Hanna Huskova (Belarus, freestyle skiing) as gold medalist in 2018, silver in 2022 - strongest medal contender identified. Notes medals won't count in official tally. Date: 8 days ago, Games opening day.

**NBC Insider (Feb 11, 2026)**: Basic factual overview of AIN program. Confirms 20 athletes, restrictions on flags/anthems. No performance data or medal results mentioned. Date: 3 days ago.

**UNITED24 Media (Feb 11, 2026)**: Ukrainian government-affiliated source. Contains factual historical data (442 global doping violations, 133 Russian) and timeline of Russian suspensions. Names same athletes as BBC with additional context on military connections. Adeliia Petrosian mentioned for 2025 military fundraising masterclass. Heavily opinionated from Ukrainian perspective - opinions not from neutral experts. Date: 3 days ago.

**Sports Illustrated Medal Predictions (Feb 6, 2026)**: Expert predictions across all events. **Critical finding: NO AIN athletes predicted to win any medals in any event covered**. Predictions from professional sports journalists. Date: 8 days ago, opening day.

**AskNews Articles (Feb 13-14, 2026)**: MOST CURRENT AND CRITICAL SOURCES.

- **Championat.com (Feb 14, 2026 - TODAY)**: **Petr Gumennik finished 6th in men's figure skating with 271.21 points**. Savely Korostelev finished 15th in 10km cross-country. These are ACTUAL RESULTS, not predictions.

- **Forbes.ru (Feb 13, 2026 - YESTERDAY)**: **Confirms Gumennik 6th place finish**. Gold to Kazakhstan's Shaidorov (291.58), silver to Japan's Kagiyama (280.06), bronze to Japan's Sato (274.90). Korostelev finished 15th in cross-country. **No AIN medals won in these events**.

- **North Jersey/Ilia Malinin article (Feb 13, 2026)**: Details men's figure skating results. US favorite Malinin fell to 8th place. Confirms no AIN athletes medaled.

- **Koloskov statement (Feb 13, 2026)**: Vyacheslav Koloskov, Honorary President of Russian Football Federation (identifiable expert), stated: **"Unfortunately, our athletes will not win any medals."** He cites Korostelev's 4th place in skiathlon as already a "great achievement" given they are "significantly behind in all events."

- **Multiple sources confirm**: As of Feb 13-14, Russian AIN athletes have competed in cross-country skiing (Korostelev 15th in 10km, 4th in skiathlon; Nepryaeva 21st in 10km women's) and figure skating (Gumennik 6th in men's singles). **Zero medals won so far**.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Actual competition results (Feb 13-14)**: Gumennik 6th in figure skating, Korostelev 15th/4th in cross-country events. Multiple independent sources (Championat, Forbes, North Jersey) confirm. This is direct factual evidence of performance levels.

2. **Expert prediction from Russian official (Feb 13)**: Koloskov (identifiable expert with insider knowledge) explicitly states Russian athletes "will not win any medals." This is a strong negative indicator from someone with access to athlete preparation and form.

3. **Sports Illustrated predictions (Feb 6)**: Professional forecasters predicted zero AIN medals across all events. Independent expert analysis before competition began.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Hanna Huskova (Belarus, freestyle skiing)**: 2018 gold, 2022 silver medalist. Only athlete with proven Olympic medal pedigree. However, now 33 years old - age is a factor in aerials. Her events likely still upcoming.

2. **Remaining events**: Women's figure skating (Petrosyan competing Feb 17-19), cross-country marathon (Korostelev Feb 21, Nepryaeva Feb 22), and other disciplines still have opportunities.

3. **Historical precedent**: OAR 2018 won 17 medals despite restrictions. However, that was 168 athletes vs 20 now - not directly comparable.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **BBC investigation findings**: While factually documented, pro-war connections don't directly predict athletic performance. More relevant to eligibility than medal probability.

2. **Small delegation size**: 20 athletes is very small, but quality matters more than quantity for medal probability.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 9 days remaining (Feb 14 to Feb 23, 2026). Olympics close Feb 22 per resolution criteria.

**Current status**: As of Feb 14 (today), approximately 8 days of competition have passed. Key events completed:
- Men's figure skating: Gumennik 6th (no medal)
- Men's 10km cross-country: Korostelev 15th (no medal)
- Women's 10km cross-country: Nepryaeva 21st (no medal)

**Remaining opportunities**:
- Women's figure skating (Petrosyan): Feb 17-19
- Cross-country marathons: Feb 21-22
- Freestyle skiing (Huskova and others): Timing unclear but likely upcoming
- Speed skating, luge, ski mountaineering: Various dates

**If timeframe halved (4.5 days)**: Would significantly reduce probability as fewer events remain. Petrosyan's figure skating might be only major opportunity.

**If timeframe doubled (18 days)**: Not applicable - Olympics have fixed end date.

**Critical insight**: We're past the halfway point with zero medals. Best-identified contender (Gumennik) finished 6th, missing podium by significant margin (20+ points). Russian official already declared no medals expected.

## (d) Justification

**Outside view base rate**: 72% probability of at least one medal, based on:
- Historical 10-15% medal efficiency
- 20 athletes × 0.10 = 2 expected medals
- Named contenders in figure skating and cross-country

**Major shifts from actual results**:

1. **Gumennik's 6th place finish (Strong negative)**: He was identified as one of two "best medal prospects" in figure skating. His 271.21 points were 20+ points behind bronze (274.90). This wasn't a close 4th place - he was clearly outclassed. This eliminates one of the two strongest medal chances.

2. **Korostelev's performances (Strong negative)**: 15th in 10km, 4th in skiathlon. The 4th place shows he's competitive but not quite medal level. His remaining event (marathon Feb 21) is now his only chance, but 4th place suggests he's just outside podium quality.

3. **Koloskov's expert statement (Strong negative)**: A Russian sports official with insider knowledge explicitly predicting zero medals. He characterized 4th place as "already a great achievement" - suggesting expectations are very low. This is an identifiable expert opinion directly addressing the question.

4. **Sports Illustrated predictions (Moderate negative)**: Professional forecasters predicted zero AIN medals. This was before competition, but actual results are validating their assessment.

5. **Huskova remains (Moderate positive)**: Only athlete with proven Olympic medal pedigree (gold 2018, silver 2022). At 33, age is a concern, but she's the strongest remaining chance. However, she's just one athlete.

6. **Petrosyan in women's figure skating (Weak positive)**: 18-year-old competing Feb 17-19. No Olympic track record. Given Gumennik's 6th place and the competitive field, her medal chances appear low.

**Revised probability reasoning**:

The outside view of 72% was based on:
- Historical efficiency suggesting 2-3 medals from 20 athletes
- Named contenders who won Russian championships
- Figure skating and cross-country as traditional strengths

**Reality check**:
- Best figure skating prospect: 6th place, not close to podium
- Best cross-country prospect: 4th place in one event, 15th in another
- Russian expert: Explicitly predicts zero medals
- Professional forecasters: Predicted zero medals
- 8 days of competition: Zero medals won

**Remaining chances**:
1. Huskova (freestyle skiing): Realistic chance given medal history, but 33 years old
2. Korostelev (marathon Feb 21): 4th in skiathlon suggests possible but unlikely
3. Petrosyan (figure skating Feb 17-19): Young, unproven at Olympic level
4. Other athletes in speed skating, luge, ski mountaineering: No evidence of medal potential

**Probability calculation**:
- Huskova medal probability: ~25% (age factor, but proven medalist)
- Korostelev marathon: ~10% (4th in skiathlon, but marathons are different)
- Petrosyan: ~5% (young, unproven, Gumennik's failure suggests weak field)
- Other athletes combined: ~5%

Combined probability of at least one medal: 1 - (0.75 × 0.90 × 0.95 × 0.95) ≈ 1 - 0.61 ≈ **39%**

This represents a massive downward shift from 72%, but is justified by:
- Direct evidence of actual performance (not speculation)
- Expert opinion from identifiable source
- Elimination of strongest contenders through actual results
- Validation of pre-Games expert predictions

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view of 72%, I must heavily adjust downward based on:

**Strongest factors warranting large downward shift:**
1. Actual competition results showing best prospects finishing 4th-6th, not medaling
2. Russian sports official explicitly predicting zero medals
3. 8 days of competition completed with zero medals
4. Professional forecasters' zero-medal prediction being validated

**Factors preventing shift to very low probability (<20%):**
1. Huskova's proven Olympic medal record (gold 2018, silver 2022)
2. 9 days of competition remaining with multiple events
3. Historical precedent of Russian athletes finding ways to medal under restrictions

**Calibration check:**
- 72% → Too high given actual results and expert opinion
- 39% → Reasonable given Huskova's proven ability but acknowledging most chances eliminated
- 20% → Too low given Huskova's track record and remaining events

The evidence strongly suggests the outside view was too optimistic. The actual performance of named contenders (Gumennik 6th, Korostelev 4th/15th) shows the AIN athletes are competing but not at medal level, with one exception (Huskova) who has proven Olympic success.

**Final calibration**: 38%

This reflects:
- ~25% chance from Huskova alone
- ~13% combined from all other remaining opportunities
- Heavy weight on actual results vs. pre-competition speculation
- Acknowledgment that one proven medalist (Huskova) remains

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will any of the 20 Russian/Belarusian Individual Neutral Athletes win gold/silver/bronze at 2026 Winter Olympics (ends Feb 22-23)?

2. **Outside view base rate**: 72% based on historical 10-15% medal efficiency and named contenders. Current circumstances ARE vastly different - actual results show best prospects finishing 4th-6th, not medaling. Russian expert predicts zero medals. This justifies large downward shift.

3. **Consistency check**: "38 out of 100 times, at least one AIN athlete wins a medal." This aligns with Huskova having ~25% individual chance plus small probabilities from remaining athletes. Makes sense given actual performance data.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - Gumennik finished 6th in figure skating (20+ points from bronze) - eliminates strongest prospect
   - Russian official Koloskov explicitly predicts zero medals - expert opinion
   - Huskova (Belarus) has gold 2018, silver 2022 in freestyle skiing - only proven medalist
   - Korostelev 4th in skiathlon, 15th in 10km - competitive but not medal level
   - 8 days completed, zero medals won - validates pre-Games predictions

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Huskova wins gold in freestyle skiing aerials, validating her proven Olympic track record despite age concerns. Petrosyan surprises in women's figure skating. This could make 38% look too conservative. However, given actual results from other athletes, this scenario requires two positive surprises vs. the pattern of underperformance.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Current trend is zero medals through 8 days, with best prospects finishing 4th-6th. If this continues, resolution is NO. However, Huskova's proven medal history (not just potential) provides meaningful probability of breaking this trend. 38% appropriately weights both the negative trend and the one strong exception.

Probability: 38%
