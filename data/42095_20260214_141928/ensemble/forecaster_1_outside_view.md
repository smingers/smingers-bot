Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Statista page (Beijing 2022)**: Historical medal table data from 2022 Winter Olympics. Limited utility as content is behind paywall. Low relevance.

**ESPN Beijing 2022 Medal Count**: Factual data showing ROC won 32 medals (6G, 12S, 14B) and Belarus won 2 medals (0G, 2S, 0B) at Beijing 2022. High-quality historical reference. Date: 2022.

**NBC Beijing 2022 Medal Standings**: Confirms ROC's 32 medals and Belarus's 2 medals. Corroborates ESPN data. High-quality factual source. Date: 2022.

**CBS8 Article (Feb 2026)**: Current reporting on AIN program. Key facts: 20 total AIN athletes (13 Russian, 7 Belarusian) competing across 8 sports. Lists specific athletes and sports. Describes strict vetting requirements (no military ties, no war support, anti-doping compliance). High-quality, timely source with factual roster information.

**The Guardian Article (Feb 11, 2026)**: Recent analysis piece. Key facts: 13 Russian AINs competing. Notes Aleksandr Bolshunov (3 Beijing golds) was rejected due to military ties. Contains multiple opinions from Russian officials (Milonov, Kramareva, Degtyarev, Tarasova) expressing frustration with ban - these are political commentary, not expert forecasting opinions. IOC President Bach's statement on neutrality principles is relevant context. Date: Feb 11, 2026 (3 days ago).

**Moscow Times Article (Feb 12, 2026)**: Most recent source (2 days ago). Critical fact: **As of Feb 12, Russian AIN athletes had not yet won any medals**. Names specific medal contenders: figure skaters Petrosyan and Gumennik (both won Russian championships), cross-country skiers Nepryaeva and Korostelev (both won Russian Cup). Notes 30+ Russian athletes competing for other countries. Only 15% of Russians planned to watch. Date: Feb 12, 2026 (2 days ago).

**Agent Report**: Provides crucial historical context:
- PyeongChang 2018 OAR: 168 athletes → 17 medals (medal efficiency: 10%)
- Beijing 2022 ROC: 212 athletes → 32 medals (medal efficiency: 15%)
- 2026 AIN: 20 athletes (13 Russian, 7 Belarusian)
Notes that sport-by-sport breakdown is missing but overall efficiency metrics are clear.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **OAR 2018 & ROC 2022 neutral delegations**: Most directly comparable. Russian athletes competed under neutral status with restrictions (though less severe than 2026). Medal efficiencies: 10% (2018) and 15% (2022).

2. **Small national delegations at Winter Olympics**: Countries sending 15-25 athletes typically win 0-3 medals. However, these are often developing winter sports nations, not historically dominant ones.

3. **Individual Russian/Belarusian athletes in specific sports**: Russia historically strong in figure skating, cross-country skiing, biathlon. Belarus less dominant but competitive in freestyle skiing.

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: OAR 2018 and ROC 2022, adjusted downward for:
- Much smaller delegation (20 vs 168/212)
- Stricter vetting (military-affiliated athletes excluded)
- No team events
- Athletes competing individually, not as cohesive national team

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 9 days (Feb 14 to Feb 23, 2026). The Olympics are currently underway - they opened around Feb 6-7, 2026.

**Critical Timing Factor**: As of Feb 12 (2 days ago), no AIN medals had been won yet. This means:
- Early medal events (first week) have largely concluded without AIN success
- Remaining window is ~7-9 days for medal opportunities
- Some sports (figure skating, cross-country) likely have events still to come

**Historical Pattern**: At both 2018 and 2022, Russian neutral athletes won medals throughout the Games, not concentrated in early days. Medal efficiency of 10-15% with larger delegations suggests strong athletes can medal even under restrictions.

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Calculation**:
- Historical efficiency: 10-15% for much larger delegations (168-212 athletes)
- 2026 delegation: 20 athletes
- Simple projection: 20 × 0.10 = 2 medals; 20 × 0.15 = 3 medals

**Downward Adjustments**:
1. **Stricter vetting**: Top performers like Bolshunov (3 Beijing golds) excluded due to military ties. This likely removed 20-30% of medal potential.
2. **No team events**: Eliminates entire categories (ice hockey gold in 2018, figure skating team medals, etc.)
3. **Individual competition psychology**: Competing without national support/team cohesion may reduce performance
4. **As of Feb 12, zero medals won**: Suggests either (a) AIN athletes in early events underperformed, or (b) strongest AIN athletes compete in later events

**Upward Adjustments**:
1. **Named medal contenders remain**: Petrosyan and Gumennik (figure skating), Nepryaeva and Korostelev (cross-country) are described as "strong/potential contenders" and won recent Russian championships
2. **Quality over quantity**: The 20 athletes who passed vetting may be cleaner, more dedicated athletes
3. **Historical precedent**: Even heavily restricted, Russian athletes found ways to medal in 2018

**Key Uncertainty**: The Feb 12 report of zero medals is concerning but not definitive. If figure skating and cross-country events (where named contenders compete) are yet to come, medal probability remains meaningful.

Outside view calibration:

Starting with the base rate of 2-3 expected medals from historical efficiency, I need to adjust for:

**Major downward factors**:
- 50% reduction in expected medals due to military-affiliated exclusions (removes top tier)
- 30% reduction due to no team events
- 20% reduction due to individual vs team psychology
- Current zero-medal status suggests early-event athletes underperformed

**Countervailing factors**:
- Named contenders in figure skating and cross-country (sports where Russia historically excels)
- 9 days remaining provides multiple opportunities
- Even one medal from 20 athletes = 5% efficiency, well below historical 10-15%

**Probability reasoning**:
- Probability of zero medals from 20 athletes, given historical 10-15% efficiency and named contenders: relatively low
- Probability of at least one medal: Should be moderate-to-high
- With 4 named "strong/potential contenders" in figure skating and cross-country, if each has independent 20-30% medal probability, combined probability of at least one medal: 1 - (0.75^4) ≈ 68% to 1 - (0.70^4) ≈ 76%

**Calibration check**:
- 50%: Too low given historical precedent and named contenders
- 90%: Too high given zero medals so far and severe restrictions
- 70-75%: Reasonable middle ground acknowledging both strong historical performance and current constraints

The zero-medal status as of Feb 12 is concerning but figure skating (a traditional Russian strength with two named contenders) likely has events remaining. Cross-country skiing similarly has medal opportunities ahead.
