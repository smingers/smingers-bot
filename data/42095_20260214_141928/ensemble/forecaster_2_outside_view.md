- Notes: Sport-by-sport breakdowns still missing

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **ROC at Beijing 2022 (212 athletes → 32 medals)**
   - Suitability: Moderate - different scale and conditions
   - Pros: Most recent Winter Olympics, Russian athletes
   - Cons: Full team participation including team events; 10x more athletes

2. **OAR at PyeongChang 2018 (168 athletes → 17 medals)**
   - Suitability: Moderate - similar neutral status
   - Pros: Also competed as neutrals under restrictions
   - Cons: Still 8x more athletes; different vetting process

3. **AIN 2026 (20 athletes) with historical efficiency rates**
   - Suitability: High - most directly applicable
   - Calculation: 20 athletes × 0.10 efficiency = 2 medals; 20 × 0.15 efficiency = 3 medals
   - Pros: Accounts for actual delegation size and historical performance
   - Cons: Assumes efficiency transfers despite stricter vetting

4. **Russian neutrals at Paris 2024 Summer Olympics (15 athletes)**
   - Suitability: Low-Moderate - different season/sports
   - Pros: Most recent AIN experience with similar vetting
   - Cons: Summer vs Winter sports; no medal data provided

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** AIN 2026 delegation size (20 athletes) combined with historical neutral-status efficiency rates (0.10-0.15).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 9 days (Feb 14 - Feb 23, 2026)

The 2026 Winter Olympics runs Feb 6-22, 2026. The question opened Feb 14, meaning:
- Games are already underway (Day 9 of 17)
- As of Feb 12, no AIN medals had been won yet
- Approximately 8 days of competition remain

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**
- Medal distribution typically spreads throughout Olympics
- Key Russian strength sports at 2026: Figure skating (3 athletes), Cross-country skiing (3), Speed skating (3), Freestyle skiing (3)
- Figure skating events typically occur mid-to-late Games
- Cross-country skiing has multiple events throughout

**Critical Constraint:** Only 20 athletes across 8 sports, compared to 168-212 in previous neutral delegations.

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Calculation:**
- Historical efficiency: 0.10-0.15 medals per athlete
- 20 athletes × 0.10 = 2 expected medals (lower bound)
- 20 athletes × 0.15 = 3 expected medals (upper bound)

**Negative Factors:**
1. **Stricter vetting:** Top athletes like Bolshunov (3 Beijing golds) excluded
2. **No team events:** Eliminates medal opportunities (e.g., ice hockey gold in 2018)
3. **Small delegation:** Less redundancy, fewer chances
4. **As of Feb 12:** No medals won yet despite 6 days of competition
5. **Reduced support:** No national team infrastructure, limited coaching

**Positive Factors:**
1. **Quality over quantity:** Only cleared athletes competing
2. **Identified medal contenders:** Petrosyan, Gumennik (figure skating); Nepryaeva, Korostelev (cross-country) - all recent national champions
3. **Historical strength:** Russia traditionally strong in winter sports
4. **Time remaining:** ~8 days of competition left, including key figure skating events
5. **Individual events only:** May concentrate talent in specific disciplines

**Critical Assessment:**
The fact that no medals have been won as of Feb 12 (Day 7) is concerning but not definitive. Figure skating (a traditional Russian strength with 2 strong contenders) typically occurs later in the Games. However, the 90% reduction in delegation size (212→20) combined with exclusion of top athletes suggests efficiency will be lower than historical 0.10-0.15 rates.

Outside view calibration:

**Tethering to Source Data:**
- The Moscow Times explicitly states (as of Feb 12): "Russian athletes competing under a neutral flag had not yet won any medals"
- This is Day 7 of 17, with ~40% of competition complete
- Expected medals based on historical efficiency: 2-3 medals
- Actual medals so far: 0

**Probability Considerations:**

**For "Yes" outcome (at least 1 medal):**
- 2-3 expected medals suggests high probability of at least 1
- Named medal contenders in figure skating and cross-country
- ~8 days of competition remaining
- However, 0 medals through Day 7 is below expectation

**For "No" outcome (zero medals):**
- Would require all 20 athletes to fail across all remaining events
- Historically unprecedented for Russian winter athletes at this scale
- But stricter vetting removed top performers

**Domain upset rate:** Winter Olympics typically see favorites win, but upsets occur ~20-30% of the time in individual events. The "no medals yet" fact is a significant update against the base rate.

**Calibration:**
- Pure base rate (2-3 expected medals): Would suggest 85-95% chance of ≥1 medal
- Adjustment for "no medals through Day 7": -20 percentage points
- Adjustment for stricter vetting/smaller delegation: -10 percentage points
- Adjustment for identified strong contenders still competing: +10 percentage points
- Net: 65-75% probability range

Given the specific named medal contenders (especially in figure skating, which occurs later) and 8 days remaining, but tempered by the concerning zero-medal performance so far, I estimate a 68% probability of at least one AIN medal.
