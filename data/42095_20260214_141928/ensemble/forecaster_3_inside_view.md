Analysis:
**1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)**  
Resolves **Yes** if **any Russian/Belarusian “Individual Neutral Athlete” (AIN)** wins **any Olympic medal** (gold/silver/bronze) **in events occurring on/after 2026‑02‑14 14:09:10Z**, per official Olympics results/credible sources.

## (a) Source analysis (summary, quality, date; facts vs opinions)

1) **BBC Sport (Feb 4, 2026)** – High-quality journalism; focuses on eligibility/vetting controversies and specific athletes’ alleged pro‑war links.  
- **Facts:** 20 AIN cleared; eligibility rules; named flagged athletes; team events barred.  
- **Opinions:** Ukrainian athlete criticism; political responses.  
- **Forecast relevance:** Indirect—raises small risk of late exclusion/controversy; doesn’t quantify medal chances.

2) **CBS Sports (Feb 6, 2026)** – Mainstream sports outlet; reliable for participation/structure; highlights notable Belarusian aerialist Hanna Huskova.  
- **Facts:** 20 AIN total; restrictions; Huskova’s past Olympic medals (2018 gold, 2022 silver).  
- **Opinions:** “Headlining” language; medal-count framing.  
- **Forecast relevance:** Directly relevant—identifies at least one historically medal‑capable AIN (Huskova).

3) **NBC explainer (Feb 11, 2026)** – General explainer; reliable but not analytical for medal prospects.  
- **Facts:** AIN definition, counts, restrictions.  
- **Opinions:** Minimal.  
- **Forecast relevance:** Low—mostly context.

4) **UNITED24 Media (Feb 11, 2026)** – Ukrainian outlet; potentially biased framing; still cites verifiable doping history and repeats BBC claims.  
- **Facts:** participation count; historical doping/ban timeline (broadly consistent with public record).  
- **Opinions:** Strong normative stance; propaganda framing.  
- **Forecast relevance:** Limited; may marginally increase perceived risk of sanctions/controversy, but not a medal-probability driver.

5) **Sports Illustrated medal picks (Feb 6, 2026)** – Useful but incomplete; depends on what events were actually covered in the excerpt.  
- **Facts:** It’s a prediction list, not results.  
- **Opinions:** Their medal picks are expert judgment, but uncertain coverage breadth.  
- **Forecast relevance:** Moderate but noisy—absence of AIN medal picks is a weak-to-moderate negative signal.

6) **AskNews / Championat + Forbes.ru results writeups (Feb 13–14, 2026)** – Secondary reporting but plausible/consistent; the key value is **near-real-time performance**.  
- **Facts (as reported):** Men’s figure skating: **Petr Gumennik 6th**; men’s XC 10 km: **Korostelev 15th**; no AIN medals in those events.  
- **Opinions:** Some Russian commentary downplaying chances (RT quote).  
- **Forecast relevance:** High—confirms that one of the best Russian AIN medal pathways (men’s singles figure) is already gone.

7) **AP-style reporting (Jan 27–28, 2026; via NBC Chicago / Perth Now / Univision summaries)** – High reliability on invitations/rosters and “best prospects” claims.  
- **Facts:** invitation numbers and sports; restrictions.  
- **Opinions/expert framing:** “Best medal prospects are Petrosyan and Gumennik.”  
- **Forecast relevance:** Moderate-to-strong—establishes that a large share of AIN medal probability was concentrated in a few athletes; one (Gumennik) already failed to medal.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

**Strong evidence (pushes probability down):**
- **Event opportunity has already shrunk due to the question’s time window.** The question only counts medals **from Feb 14 14:09Z onward**, and men’s figure skating medals were awarded **before** that (and Gumennik finished 6th anyway). This mechanically removes a major medal avenue.  
- **Observed performance signal:** Gumennik 6th, Korostelev 15th—consistent with “competitive but not podium” so far.

**Moderate evidence (mixed):**
- **Concentration of medal equity:** Multiple sources (AP-style + subsequent results) imply Russia’s best AIN medal chances were **heavily concentrated** in a few stars (not a deep roster). That raises the chance of a total medal miss if those few don’t deliver. (Downward.)  
- **Hanna Huskova’s prior Olympic medals (2018 gold, 2022 silver).** A demonstrated podium-level athlete still competing in a medal event is a meaningful positive. (Upward.)

**Weak evidence (small adjustments):**
- **SI not listing AIN medalists** (unclear event coverage; predictions can be conservative and miss tails). Slight downward.  
- **Eligibility/vetting controversy (BBC/UNITED24)** could theoretically cause late removal or distractions, but late-stage disqualifications for political/neutrality reasons seem less common than simply letting competitions proceed. Slight downward.

## (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Forecasting window:** From now (2026‑02‑14) to resolution (2026‑02‑23) ≈ **9 days**, with Olympic competitions ending Feb 22.  
- **If timeframe were halved (~4–5 days left):** fewer remaining AIN starts/events ⇒ probability would drop meaningfully (I’d expect ~5–10 points lower), because remaining medal chances are concentrated in a small set of events/athletes.  
- **If timeframe were doubled (~18 days left):** it would imply either more events or earlier events counted; more “lottery tickets” ⇒ probability would rise (perhaps +10–15 points), because “at least one medal” benefits strongly from more independent chances.

## (d) Justification: updating from outside view (68%) to inside view

**Outside view base rate (given): 68%** for ≥1 AIN medal (implicitly across the Games / overall opportunity set).

**Key inside-view updates:**
1) **Crucial: the question’s clock starts Feb 14 14:09Z.** Several high-value medal opportunities already occurred earlier in the Games and **do not count** for this question. This makes the original reference class less analogous (it assumed something closer to “whole Olympics” opportunity). **Downward shift.**
2) **Men’s singles figure skating (a primary Russian medal pathway) is already decided** and Gumennik placed 6th (AskNews results). Combined with AP-style “top prospects” framing, this removes a large chunk of medal probability mass. **Downward shift.**
3) **Remaining upside is real but narrower:** most of the “Yes” probability now rides on a small number of athletes/events—especially **Adeliia Petrosyan (women’s figure still upcoming)** and **Hanna Huskova (aerials)** plus a thinner tail from speed skating/short track/luge. This concentration increases variance and raises the chance of a full miss. **Downward shift, but not to zero.**

Net: these are sufficiently impactful to reduce the outside-view baseline materially (the opportunity set is smaller and one major contender already “failed”), but not enough to make “Yes” unlikely because at least one genuine medal-caliber athlete remains.

Probability calibration:
- **Status quo / trend:** No AIN medals so far; early results show AINs finishing well off podium in some key events. Continuing that pattern implies **No**.  
- **But** the remaining schedule still contains a plausible medal pathway (notably Huskova and women’s figure).  
- I land in the mid‑50s: “Yes” is slightly more likely than “No,” but only slightly, because medal equity is now concentrated and the eligible cohort is small.

Checklist:
1) Criteria match: **Any AIN medal on/after 2026‑02‑14 14:09Z** at Milano‑Cortina ⇒ Yes.  
2) Outside view base rate: **68%**.  
3) Consistency: **56 out of 100 times, at least one AIN wins a medal within the counted time window.**  
4) Key evidence (most important):
   - Question time-window excludes earlier events; opportunity set shrank (strong, structural).  
   - Gumennik (major prospect) already **6th** in men’s figure; that medal path is gone (strong).  
   - Huskova has prior Olympic **gold/silver** in aerials; Petrosyan still to compete (moderate positive).  
   - Neutral cohort is only **20 athletes**, no team events (structural constraint).  
5) Blind spot: **Petrosyan wins gold or Huskova medals** (a single-event hit swings the whole question to Yes); this would make a sub‑50% forecast look silly—pushes me away from going too low.  
6) Status quo nudge: No medals so far + small delegation ⇒ slight tilt toward **No**, keeping me near (but below) 60.

Probability: 56%
