Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, all 2026 unless noted)  
1. BBC (4 Feb) – mainstream, high-quality, factual roster (20 AIN athletes, sports), vetting rules; some opinion quotes from athletes.  
2. CBS Sports (6 Feb) – reliable U.S. sports outlet; reiterates 20 athletes, lists Hanna Huskova as headline medal hope.  
3. NBC (11 Feb) – U.S. broadcaster holding domestic TV rights; purely factual explainer, confirms numbers and restrictions.  
4. Sports Illustrated predictions (6 Feb) – respected magazine; editorial medal forecast shows zero AIN medals (opinion, moderate value).  
5. AskNews event reports (13-14 Feb) – real-time result wires; give finished placings: Petr Gumennik 6th in men’s figure skating, Korostelev 15th in XC 10 km; no AIN medals so far. Very strong, factual evidence.  
6. Russian outlets (Forbes ru, Championat, MK, RT) – timely results identical to AskNews; bias possible but placings match independent wires → factual.  
7. Guardian (11 Feb) & other November-25 IOC pieces – background on strict vetting, high quality; factual that stars such as Bolshunov were excluded.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Official / multiple-wire confirmation that AIN athletes have 0 medals after first eight days.  
• Only 20 AIN competitors; team/relay events banned (structural, hard to change).  
Moderate evidence  
• Presence of two bona-fide medal contenders still to compete:  
 – Adeliia Petrosian (women’s singles figure skating, quad jumps)  
 – Hanna Huskova (women’s aerials, 2018 G & 2022 S).  
• Historical Russian medal efficiency (0.10–0.15 medals per athlete in 2018/22) shows latent quality.  
• Sports Illustrated forecast of zero AIN medals (single source, opinion).  
Weak evidence  
• Comments by Russian officials (“no medals”) – anecdotal, motivated.  
• Speed-skating / short-track outsiders; long-shot potential only.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• 9 days remain (events conclude 22 Feb).  
• If only 4–5 days remained, chance would drop ~5 pp (fewer opportunities).  
• If 18 days remained, chance +5 pp (more events left, especially early-round volatility).

(d) Justification and inside-view shift  
Outside-view base rate (66 %) came from scaling Russia’s historic medals/athlete then cutting for small squad & bans.  
Updates:  
1. Early events with plausible chances (men’s figure, early luge, XC sprint) yielded none ⇒ −4 pp.  
2. Confirmed that Petrosian & Huskova are starting and healthy ⇒ +2 pp.  
3. Sports-Illustrated and pundit pessimism plus potential judging/political bias ⇒ −2 pp.  
Net adjustment −4 pp → 62 %.

Status-quo (no-medal) outcome today is still “Yes” = 0; but two upcoming events hold meaningful win equity, preventing a drastic downward move.

Probability calibration
I expect that in 62 out of 100 re-runs of the next nine days at Milano-Cortina, at least one AIN athlete sneaks onto a podium—most likely Petrosian in women’s figure or Huskova in aerials.

Checklist:
1. Restatement – “Between 14–22 Feb 2026, will any of the 20 Russian/Belarusian ‘Individual Neutral Athletes’ take gold/silver/bronze?.”  
2. Outside view base: 66 %.  
3. Consistency line above.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Only 20 AIN athletes, no team events.  
   • 0 medals after first week.  
   • Petrosian (quad jumps) competes 17/19 Feb.  
   • Huskova (past G+S) competes c. 20 Feb.  
   • Historical 0.10–0.15 medals/athlete for neutral Russia.  
5. Blind-spot: unforeseen disqualification or injury of both Petrosian and Huskova would crash chances to <20 %.  
6. Status-quo nudge: “no medals yet” pulls slightly downward, hence 62 % not higher.

Probability: 62%
