Analysis:
1. Source analysis (chronological excerpts)
• BBC (4 Feb 2026): reports IOC-approved list of 20 AIN athletes, gives names and sports; reputable, purely factual.  
• CBS (6 Feb): repeats numbers, highlights Hanna Huskova’s pedigree; reliable U.S. network, mainly facts.  
• NBC (11 Feb): explainer on rules, no performance data; good for institutional context.  
• UNITED24 (11 Feb): Ukrainian outlet criticising vetting; factual parts on athletes’ war-links credible but partisan.  
• Sports Illustrated (6 Feb): medal predictions; no AINs on podium; subjective but based on expert preview.  
• AskNews package (13-14 Feb): live Russian- and English-language reports.  Key facts:  
  - Korostelev 4th (skiathlon) & 15th (10 km); still two races left.  
  - Petr Gumennik 6th in men’s figure skating; event finished.  
  - No AIN medals awarded as of 14 Feb.  
  - Russian commentators (Koloskov) already pessimistic.  
All reports are within the last ten days and come from mainstream sports or news agencies; factual performance data are high-quality, while projections/pundit quotes are opinion.

2. Evidence analysis
Strong evidence  
• Official results show AINs shut out of the first 31 medal events (structural fact).  
• Only 20 AIN athletes, no team events – severe reduction vs 200+ Russian athletes & 32 medals in 2022 (historical pattern, structural).  
Moderate evidence  
• Past champions remain: Belarus’ Hanna Huskova (2018 gold, 2022 silver) and Russia’s Adeliia Petrosian can still compete (individual pedigree, indirect causal).  
• World-cup rust: three-year ban from most international winter circuits reduces competitiveness (logical causal link).  
• Expert previews (SI, Guardian) forecast zero or very few AIN medals (single expert sources).  
Weak evidence  
• Russian officials’ pessimistic sound-bites (anecdotal).  
• Potential judging bias for/against Russians (speculative).

3. Timeframe analysis  
Days until closing ceremony: 8.  About 60 remaining medal events include the last realistic AIN chances: women’s aerials (18 Feb), women’s figure skating (17 & 19 Feb), cross-country marathons (21–22 Feb), short-track finals (18–20 Feb), luge women’s doubles (16 Feb) and ski mountaineering sprint (20 Feb).  
If the Games ended four days earlier, most of these finals would not yet have happened, cutting the probability roughly in half (to ≈30%).  Doubling timeframe is irrelevant – schedule is fixed.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view Poisson estimate (base rate) = 75 %.  
Updates:  
- Roughly 30 % of medal events are already complete with zero AIN podiums → −6  pp.  
- Observed placements: best 4th & 6th suggest athletes are competitive but a tier below podium → −4 pp.  
+ Two high-leverage chances still ahead (Petrosian, Huskova) → +2 pp.  
Net inside-view = 75 − 6 − 4 + 2 ≈ 67 %.  
Rounded to 65 % to acknowledge model uncertainty and correlation between the two top prospects.

Probability calibration
The median of my subjective distribution is therefore 65 %.  I judge a 90 % chance the true probability lies in the 50-80 % band.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Between now (14 Feb 2026) and 22 Feb 2026, will at least one AIN win any Olympic medal?”  
2. Base rate used: 75 % (Poisson from prior ROC/OAR efficiency).  
3. Consistency line: “In 65 out of 100 comparable Games, at least one neutral Russian/Belarusian would medal.”  
4. Key evidence (brief)  
  a. 20-athlete cap, no team events.  
  b. Zero medals after first 31 medal events.  
  c. Huskova (women’s aerials) & Petrosian (women’s figure skating) still to compete.  
  d. Three-year competition ban likely dulled form.  
  e. Expert previews mostly project zero medals.  
5. Blind spot: Petrosian nails two clean quad programs, judges reward her, she takes gold; my 35 % “no-medal” side looks low.  
6. Status quo: trend so far = 0 medals; nudges probability downward from base but not below 50 % because biggest events still ahead.

Probability: 65%
