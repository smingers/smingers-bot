## Summary of Beijing 2022 Medal Standings

**Key Facts and Statistics:**

This article presents the final medal standings from the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing. The relevant data points for the forecasting question are:

- **ROC (Russian Olympic Committee)**: 32 total medals (6 gold, 12 silver, 14 bronze) - ranked 2nd overall
- **Belarus**: 2 total medals (0 gold, 2 silver, 0 bronze) - ranked 24th overall

**Relevance to the Question:**

This data shows the historical performance of Russian and Belarusian athletes at the most recent Winter Olympics (2022), where they competed under different designations than the "Individual Neutral Athletes" (AIN) status they will have at the 2026 Games. At Beijing 2022, Russian athletes competed as ROC due to previous doping sanctions, while Belarusian athletes competed under their national flag. The strong medal performance by ROC athletes (32 medals, 2nd place overall) demonstrates the competitive strength of Russian winter sports athletes historically.

**Note:** This article provides only historical medal count data and contains no analysis, predictions, or expert opinions regarding the 2026 Winter Olympics.

# Summary of "Russia plays prideful, but there's no doubt the Olympics ban is hurting"

**Source:** The Guardian  
**Date:** February 11, 2026  
**Author:** Bruce Berglund (historian, writer, and editor)

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Number of Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs):** The article mentions 13 AINs representing Russia at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics (referred to as the "Russian team" by sports media).

2. **Historical context:** Russia has faced two main hurdles for Olympic participation:
   - The doping scandal that broke in 2014, leading to a state-directed doping operation being revealed by WADA
   - The ban imposed after Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine

3. **AIN requirements:** To compete as Individual Neutral Athletes, Russian and Belarusian athletes must:
   - Be clean from doping
   - Have no military connections
   - Have no record of supporting the war

4. **Notable rejection:** Cross-country skier Aleksandr Bolshunov (three gold medals in Beijing) was rejected from AIN status. His lawyer appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport, but the article notes Bolshunov was promoted from lieutenant to captain in the Russian national guard and appeared at a March 2022 rally supporting the Ukraine invasion.

## Named Source Opinions:

1. **Vitaly Milonov** (Duma member, United Russia party): Called the Olympics corrupted by the US and said in January 2026 that "The Olympics have lost their importance as a global competition."

2. **Nina Kramareva** (political scientist): Explained that "Russia has nothing concrete to offer its own people. It has to give them gold medals."

3. **Veronika Loginova** (Rusada chief): Declared in 2025 that the agency had met requirements and announced readiness to become WADA's next president. However, WADA states Rusada is still not in compliance.

4. **Thomas Bach** (IOC President, March 2023): Stated "If politics decides who can take part in a competition, then sport and athletes become tools of politics" and emphasized the IOC's "responsibility towards human rights and the Olympic Charter."

5. **Gianni Infantino** (FIFA President): Declared last week that the ban "has not achieved anything."

6. **Mikhail Degtyarev** (head of Russian Olympic Committee, November 2025): Stated Milano Cortina Games will be the last Olympics where Russians participate as neutrals.

7. **Tatyana Tarasova** (figure skating coach): Said of governing bodies: "They wanted to eliminate the competition."

## Additional Context:

- Most medals claimed by Russia at Beijing and Tokyo were won by athletes affiliated with military and security services
- The IOC wants Russian and Belarusian athletes to compete in the 2026 Youth Olympics under their national flags
- More than 30 nations (UK, France, Italy, US) affirmed opposition to Russian and Belarusian participation in 2023
- Russian officials and former Olympians are calling on Russians to support their Individual Neutral Athletes

# Summary of "At Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, Russian Athletes Are a Diminished Presence"

**Source:** The Moscow Times  
**Date:** February 12, 2026  
**Author:** Anastasia Tenisheva

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Individual Neutral Athletes (Russian):**
- 13 athletes with Russian passports cleared to compete as "Individual Neutral Athletes" across seven sport categories
- Athletes cannot participate in team events or opening/closing ceremonies
- As of Thursday (the article's publication date), Russian athletes competing under a neutral flag had **not yet won any medals**

**Named Athletes Competing as Neutrals:**
- **Figure skating:** Adelia Petrosyan (18) and Pyotr Gumennik (23) - described as "strong contenders"; both won gold at Russian Figure Skating Championships last year
- **Cross-country skiing:** Daria Nepryaeva (23) and Saveliy Korostelev (22) - "considered potential medal contenders"; both won Russian Cup last year
- **Luge:** Daria Olesik and Pavel Repilov
- **Alpine skiing:** Yulia Pleshkova and Semyon Yefimov
- **Short track:** Alyona Krylova and Ivan Posashkov
- **Speed skating:** Ksenia Korzhova and Anastasia Semenova
- **Ski mountaineering:** Nikita Filippov

**Athletes Competing for Other Countries:**
- Over 30 Russian athletes who changed sporting nationality are competing for other countries at the 2026 Winter Olympics
- Russia's Sports Ministry reported in August 2023 that 67 national team athletes had changed sporting citizenship since the invasion of Ukraine
- Figure skating accounts for the largest share with 18 athletes of Russian background competing under different flags
- Notable examples include Diana Davis and Gleb Smolkin (competing for Georgia), who finished 13th in ice dance competition

**Russian Viewership:**
- Only 15% of surveyed Russians said they planned to watch the Winter Olympics this year
- Streaming platform Okko acquired broadcast rights, but Games not shown on Russia's state television channels
- State-run TV channels provided very limited news coverage of the Games

## Opinions from Named Sources:

- **State Duma lawmaker Vitaly Milonov:** "Why watch the Games if Russia won't be there?"
- **Lawmaker Vyacheslav Fetisov:** Called the neutral status "a serious humiliation of national identity"

## Additional Context:

The article notes that eligibility for neutral status required athletes to demonstrate no ties to Russian military/security services and no public support for the war in Ukraine. The approval process took months and varied across international federations.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Give historical medal counts won by Russian and Belarusian athletes competing under neutral status at the 2018 and 2022 Winter Olympics, broken down by sport. Also list the number of neutral-status athletes entered in those Games and their medal efficiency. Finally, summarize key IOC conditions for AIN participation in 2026.
The material collected to date lets us nail down about 75 percent of what the user asked for.

A. What we now know with solid sources  

1. Totals by Games for the two neutral delegations  
• PyeongChang 2018 – “Olympic Athletes from Russia” (OAR): 17 medals (2 G, 6 S, 9 B). No Belarusian competitors were neutral that year. (CNN, 2 Feb 2022)  
• Beijing 2022 – “Russian Olympic Committee” (ROC): 32 medals (6 G, 12 S, 14 B). Belarus’ two medals came under its own flag and are therefore out of scope. (ESPN medal tracker; CNN 2 Feb 2022)  

2. Delegation sizes (eligible athletes)  
• OAR 2018: 168 athletes (CNN, 2 Feb 2022)  
• ROC 2022: 212 athletes (CNN, 2 Feb 2022)  

   Overall medal-efficiency (medals ÷ athletes)  
   – 2018: 17 ⁄ 168 ≈ 0.10  
   – 2022: 32 ⁄ 212 ≈ 0.15  

3. IOC conditions for the new “Individual Neutral Athlete” (AIN) category that will apply in 2026 – all main points located and cross-checked (NBC-New York, 31 Jan 2026; SB Nation, 6 Feb 2026):  
   • Each applicant vetted by the IOC’s AIN Eligibility Review Panel.  
   • No contract with Russian/Belarusian armed forces or security services; no public support for the war in Ukraine.  
   • Team events and relays barred; only individual events allowed.  
   • Uniform: plain white with “AIN” badge; no flag or anthem – Olympic anthem is used.  
   • No marching in Opening Ceremony; possible joint participation in Closing.  
   • Each athlete must sign the IOC “Conditions of Participation”; final clearance by the IOC Executive Board.  

Those bullet points satisfy the final part of the user’s request (“summarize key IOC conditions for AIN participation in 2026”).

B. What is still missing – and why it matters to the user’s modelling effort  

1. Medal breakdown by sport for OAR 2018.  
2. Medal breakdown by sport for ROC 2022.  
3. Number of neutral-status athletes entered in each sport at both Games so that per-sport medal-efficiency can be calculated.  

The NBC, CNN, ESPN and other news-article snippets retrieved so far give overall medal counts only. None reproduces the sport-by-sport tables that appear on the relevant Wikipedia pages (“Olympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics” and “Russian Olympic Committee at the 2022 Winter Olympics”) or in the IOC’s official Results Books. These tables list both (a) medals by discipline and (b) roster size by discipline – exactly the data still required.

C. Why another targeted search round is needed  

Without the missing sport-level numbers we cannot:  
• show, for example, that OAR’s 2018 ice-hockey squad of 25 athletes produced one gold, or that ROC’s 2022 cross-country squad of 23 athletes yielded 9 medals, etc.;  
• compute sport-specific medal-efficiency, which the question explicitly asks for.  

D. Recommended next step  

Run one more search explicitly aimed at the official team pages or the IOC Results Books, which are known to include both the medal-by-sport matrix and the athlete-entries-by-sport table.</Agent_report>

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
