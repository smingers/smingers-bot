Analysis:
To judge the likelihood that any 2026 Individual Neutral Athlete (AIN) will medal, the most useful historical context is how Russian and Belarusian athletes have performed when forced to compete under neutral designations in previous Winter Games—namely “Olympic Athletes from Russia” (OAR) in 2018 and the “Russian Olympic Committee” (ROC) in 2022. Key figures include: total medals, medal-per-athlete efficiency, and which sports produced podiums. Complementary context comes from current 2026 AIN quota sizes, IOC eligibility rules, and recent expert or federation commentary on AIN competitiveness. Searches should therefore target past neutral-flag medal counts, current AIN rosters, and up-to-date news analysis.
