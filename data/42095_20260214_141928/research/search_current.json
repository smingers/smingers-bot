Explaining IOC's hockey team ban since 2022 Winter Games**\nRussia is banned from Olympic competition by the International Olympic Committee (IOC) since 2022, following its invasion of Ukraine. The ban extends to the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan and includes Belarus. Qualified athletes from Russia and Belarus may compete as 'Individual Neutral Athletes' (AIN), identified by a teal flag with the words 'Individual Neutral Athlete' in English and French, but they cannot be introduced during the Opening Ceremony or have their national anthem played if they medal. The International Ice Hockey Federation (IIHF) also maintains a ban on Russia, and because AIN athletes cannot form a team, no Russian national hockey team can participate in the 2026 Olympics. The IOC confirmed in March 2025 that it advised the IIHF not to allow Russia to compete, noting that a group of AIN athletes cannot constitute a team. The IIHF suspended both senior and youth teams from Russia and Belarus, though it plans to consider reinstating under-18 teams in 2027\u201328. IOC officials have not provided a timeline for Russia\u2019s return, stating it depends on changes in the situation in Ukraine. IIHF president Luc Tardif expressed hope for a return 'as soon as possible' but emphasized the need for progress in the war. Russia has won nine Olympic gold medals in men's hockey, but only under the Soviet Union, Unified Team, or AIN designation; it has never won gold under the Russian flag. The 2028 Summer Olympics will begin 29 months after the 2026 Winter Games conclude, leaving open the possibility of a future change.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 07:58 PM\nSource:[Sporting News](https://www.sportingnews.com/us/nhl/news/russia-olympics-ioc-hockey-ban-winter-games/43d9ee762b84120cbffe0dd9)\n\n**How Many Medals Will Neutral Russian and Belarusian Athletes Win at Milano Cortina 2026?**\nAt the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics, Russian and Belarusian athletes will compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (AIN) due to sanctions from the International Olympic Committee (IOC) following the war in Ukraine. A total of 20 athletes\u2014up to 13 from Russia and seven from Belarus\u2014will participate in five disciplines: alpine skiing, cross-country skiing, figure skating, speed skating, and ski mountaineering. They will not be allowed to parade during the opening ceremony on February 6. The IOC confirmed the participation of specific athletes, including Russian skiers Darya Nepryayeva and Savely Korostelev, speed skaters Ksenia Korzhova and Anastasia Semyonova, figure skater Adelia Petrosyan, and others. Belarusian athletes include Maria Shkanova (alpine skiing), Maryna Zuyeva (speed skating), and Viktoriia Safonova (figure skating). Their medal prospects are considered minimal, especially without participation in team sports like ice hockey, where Russia has historically excelled. Prior to the war, Russia sent up to 200 athletes to the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, winning 32 medals, including five golds. The article raises the question of how many medals the neutral Russian and Belarusian athletes will win in Milan-Cortina 2026. Additionally, Diego Nepi Molineris, CEO of Sport e Salute, emphasized the economic potential of hosting the 2027 America\u2019s Cup in Naples, projecting a significant economic impact. Michele Uva, UEFA\u2019s Executive Director for Sustainability and Delegate for Euro 2032, highlighted plans to modernize the Stadio Olimpico as a key infrastructure project, with an estimated economic impact of nearly four billion euros for Italy, comparable to Germany\u2019s 7.6 billion euro investment for its Euro 2024 hosting.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 03:52 PM\nSource:[La Repubblica.it](https://www.repubblica.it/sport/rubriche/spycalcio/2026/01/30/news/milano_cortina_2026_quante_medaglie_russi_neutrali-425128568/)\n\n**Russian and Belarusian Athletes to Compete as Neutrals at Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics**\nA total of 13 Russian and 7 Belarusian athletes will compete as neutral athletes at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milano Cortina, which begin on February 6, 2026. They are prohibited from competing under their national flag or anthem and cannot participate in the opening ceremony. This status follows Russia's invasion of Ukraine four years prior, which led to its exclusion from most international sporting events. Belarus, a key ally of Russia during this period, has also faced similar restrictions. The International Olympic Committee approved the neutral status for athletes in individual sports who were not found to have actively supported the war against Ukraine or been affiliated with state military or security agencies. At the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing\u2014held four days before the war began\u2014209 Russian athletes participated and won 32 medals. In the 2024 Summer Olympics in Paris, 15 Russian athletes competed under the same neutral conditions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 06:32 PM\nSource:[Univision](https://www.tudn.com/juegos-olimpicos/milano-cortina-2026/veintena-atletas-rusos-bielorrusos-competiran-olimpicos-de-invierno-como-neutrales)\n\n**Winter Olympics to Feature Only 13 Russian and 7 Belarusian Athletes as Neutral Competitors**\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has confirmed invitations for 13 Russian and 7 Belarusian athletes to compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (AIN) at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina. This marks a significant reduction from the over 200 Russian athletes who participated in the 2022 Winter Games in Beijing, following Russia\u2019s full-scale invasion of Ukraine, which led to its exclusion from most international sports. The athletes from Russia and Belarus will not display their national identity, colors, flag, or anthem, nor will they participate in the opening ceremony parade. The neutral status is granted to individual athletes who did not actively support their countries\u2019 war in Ukraine and are not affiliated with state military or security agencies. Among the invited athletes, two Russians and one Belarusian are competing in alpine skiing\u2014Yulia Pleshkova, who has a best result of 40th in downhill, and Simon Efimov and Maria Shkanova in slalom, neither of whom have qualified for a second round in a World Cup event this month. In luge, Russia\u2019s Daria Olesik and Pavel Repilov have been invited; Olesik competed in a World Cup for the first time in nearly four years, and Repilov is a former Youth Olympic silver medalist. The best medal prospects for Russian athletes are figure skaters Adeliia Petrosian and Petr Gumennik. Russia remains excluded from team sports like ice hockey, as it was in the 2024 Paris Summer Games. At the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics, Russian athletes won 32 medals, including five gold, under the ROC (Russian Olympic Committee) banner. In 2026, they will compete under the AIN designation, following a December 2, 2022, ruling by the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) that overturned a blanket ban on Russian and Belarusian athletes imposed after the war intensified in February 2022.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 01:20 AM\nSource:[AP](https://apnews.com/article/juegos-olimpicos-invierno-rusos-milan-cortina-bielorrusos-183514e8400792311606e782467a8678)\n\n**2026 Olympics set to have just 13 Russian athletes and 7 from Belarus competing**\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) has confirmed invitations for 13 Russian athletes and 7 Belarusian athletes to compete as Individual Neutral Athletes (AIN) at the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics, which open on February 6, 2026.

The athletes, who must not have actively supported their countries' war on Ukraine or be affiliated with military or state security agencies, will not represent their nations with national symbols, flags, or anthems and will not participate in the opening ceremony athlete parade. The Russian athletes include alpine skiers Yulia Pleshkova, Simon Efimov, and Maria Shkanova, and lugers Daria Olesik and Pavel Repilov. Olesik competed in a World Cup luge race for the first time in nearly four years, while Repilov previously won silver at the 2020 Lausanne Winter Youth Olympics.

Their participation followed qualification through the International Skating Union\u2019s selection process and a second review by a specialized committee of the International Olympic Committee (IOC). The IOC maintained the same criteria used in the 2024 Paris Summer Olympics: individual participation only, no ties to the Russian military or security forces, and no public support for Russia\u2019s February 2022 invasion of Ukraine. The IOC stated that the initial list published on Thursday will be updated based on decisions from the Individual Neutral Athletes Review Committee, though it is unlikely to include as many athletes as in Paris (15 Russians and 17 Belarusians, who won five medals). Unlike summer international federations, which largely reinstated Russian and Belarusian athletes under neutral status per IOC recommendations, winter sports federations remain notably cautious. The International Skating Union, which governs events accounting for over half of the Olympic podiums, and the Biathlon Union continue to enforce strict bans, as does the International Ski and Snowboard Federation. The Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) cleared the way in late October for the reintegration of Russian skaters, ruling the exclusion disproportionate. Russia has appealed this decision, with a ruling expected before December 10. At the 2022 Beijing Olympics\u2014just before the invasion\u2014Russia, banned from playing its national anthem and raising its flag due to a doping scandal, won 32 medals, while Belarusian athletes earned two.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 08:31 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/86EP4ZQ)\n\n**IOC Allows Russian and Belarusian Athletes to Compete in 2026 Winter Olympics Under Neutral Flag**\nThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) authorized three figure skaters\u2014Russia's Petr Gumennik (23), Adeliia Petrosian (18), and Belarus's Viktoriia Safonova (22)\u2014to compete at the 2026 Winter Olympics in Milan-Cortina under a neutral flag, following a new review process initiated after the start of the war in Ukraine. All three athletes had already secured their spots through the International Skating Union (ISU) qualification events in September, but required final approval from the IOC. The IOC stated that this initial list will be updated by a review panel, which evaluates each neutral athlete individually. Despite the authorization, the delegation is expected to remain small due to the ongoing ISU ban since 2022. In the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, Russian athletes (competing under a neutral flag due to doping sanctions) won 32 medals, while Belarus earned two. At the 2024 Paris Olympics, neutral athletes from both countries won five medals.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 07:07 PM\nSource:[Metr\u00f3poles](https://www.metropoles.com/esportes/coi-libera-atletas-russos-e-bielorrussos-para-as-olimpiadas-de-inverno)\n\n**Russian, Belarusian athletes cleared to compete in 2026 Winter Olympics under neutral flag - CBSSports.com**\nAccording to the International Olympic Committee (IOC), individual Russian and Belarusian athletes will compete as 'Individual Neutral Athletes' at the 2026 Milano Cortina Olympics. They will do so under a neutral flag and neutral anthem, and any medals they win will not be counted in the official medal tally or appear in the parade of delegations at the Opening Ceremony. The IOC has set a three\u2011member panel, which includes former NBA star and Olympic medalist Pau Gasol, to review each athlete\u2019s eligibility. Teams of Russian and Belarusian athletes remain banned from the 2026 Games, meaning the Russian hockey team\u2014champions in 2018 and silver\u2011medalists in 2022\u2014cannot participate. With the NHL returning to the Olympics, stars such as Alex Ovechkin and Evgeni Malkin will miss what could be their last chance at an Olympic medal. This policy mirrors the one applied at the 2024 Paris Olympics, and it is a response to the ongoing war in Ukraine that has led to Russia and Belarus being barred from competing under their national flags.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 06:27 PM\nSource:[CBS Sports](https://www.cbssports.com/olympics/news/russian-belarusian-athletes-cleared-to-compete-in-2026-winter-olympics-under-neutral-flag/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
