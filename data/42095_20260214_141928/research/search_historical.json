The relevant data points for the forecasting question are:\n\n- **ROC (Russian Olympic Committee)**: 32 total medals (6 gold, 12 silver, 14 bronze) - ranked 2nd overall\n- **Belarus**: 2 total medals (0 gold, 2 silver, 0 bronze) - ranked 24th overall\n\n**Relevance to the Question:**\n\nThis data shows the historical performance of Russian and Belarusian athletes at the most recent Winter Olympics (2022), where they competed under different designations than the \"Individual Neutral Athletes\" (AIN) status they will have at the 2026 Games. At Beijing 2022, Russian athletes competed as ROC due to previous doping sanctions, while Belarusian athletes competed under their national flag. The strong medal performance by ROC athletes (32 medals, 2nd place overall) demonstrates the competitive strength of Russian winter sports athletes historically.\n\n**Note:** This article provides only historical medal count data and contains no analysis, predictions, or expert opinions regarding the 2026 Winter Olympics.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cbs8.com/article/sports/olympics/why-is-russia-not-in-the-opening-ceremony/507-9bd63d56-30f8-444f-90a7-ef833d629739\">\n# Article Summary: Why is Russia not in the Opening Ceremony for the 2026 Olympics?\n\n**Source:** cbs8.com\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n**Ban Status:**\n- Russia and Belarus are banned from competing at the Olympics following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022\n- The ban continues through the 2026 season\n- Russian teams, including the country's hockey program, remain completely banned from competing at the Milan Cortina Olympics\n\n**Individual Neutral Athletes (AIN) Program:**\n- Individual Russian and Belarusian athletes can compete under strict conditions as \"Individual Neutral Athletes\"\n- The International Skating Union announced a program allowing Olympic qualification for up to 24 Russian and 24 Belarusian athletes\n- These athletes cannot participate in the Parade of Nations since they're competing without a country\n\n**Number of Athletes Competing:**\n- Russia has sent 13 athletes\n- Belarus has sent 7 athletes\n- Total: 20 individual neutral athletes\n\n**Athletes by Sport:**\n- Alpine skiing: Russians Yulia Pleshkova, Simon Efimov; Belarusian Maria Shkanova\n- Cross-country skiing: Russians Savelii Korostelev, Daria Nepriaeva; Belarusian Hanna Karaliova\n- Figure skating: Russians Petr Gumennik, Adeliia Petrosian; Belarusian Viktoriya Safonova\n- Freestyle skiing: Belarusians Anastasiya Andryianava, Anna Derugo, Hanna Huskova\n- Luge: Russians Daria Olesik, Pavel Repilov\n- Short track speed skating: Russians Ivan Posashkov, Alena Krylova\n- Ski Mountaineering: Russian Nikita Filippov\n- Speed skating: Russians Kseniia Korzhova, Anastasiia Semenova; Belarusian Marina Zueva\n\n**Vetting Process:**\n- Two-step rigorous vetting process required\n- Athletes cannot have publicly supported the Ukraine invasion\n- Athletes cannot be affiliated with military or state security agencies\n- Must follow anti-doping rules and qualify through existing Olympic qualification systems\n- Vetting conducted first by international sports federations, then by the IOC\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- 15 Russian athletes competed as neutrals at the Paris 2024 Summer Olympics\n- Russian athletes competed as \"Olympic Athletes from Russia\" at the 2018 PyeongChang Winter Olympics (due to doping suspension)\n- Russians competed under \"Russian Olympic Committee\" (ROC) designation at Tokyo and Beijing Olympics\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2026/feb/11/russia-olympics-ban\">\n# Summary of \"Russia plays prideful, but there's no doubt the Olympics ban is hurting\"\n\n**Source:** The Guardian  \n**Date:** February 11, 2026  \n**Author:** Bruce Berglund (historian, writer, and editor)\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Number of Individual Neutral Athletes (AINs):** The article mentions 13 AINs representing Russia at the Milano Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics (referred to as the \"Russian team\" by sports media).\n\n2. **Historical context:** Russia has faced two main hurdles for Olympic participation:\n   - The doping scandal that broke in 2014, leading to a state-directed doping operation being revealed by WADA\n   - The ban imposed after Russia's February 2022 invasion of Ukraine\n\n3. **AIN requirements:** To compete as Individual Neutral Athletes, Russian and Belarusian athletes must:\n   - Be clean from doping\n   - Have no military connections\n   - Have no record of supporting the war\n\n4. **Notable rejection:** Cross-country skier Aleksandr Bolshunov (three gold medals in Beijing) was rejected from AIN status.

It has to give them gold medals.\"\n\n3. **Veronika Loginova** (Rusada chief): Declared in 2025 that the agency had met requirements and announced readiness to become WADA's next president.

The approval process took months and varied across international federations.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Give historical medal counts won by Russian and Belarusian athletes competing under neutral status at the 2018 and 2022 Winter Olympics, broken down by sport. Also list the number of neutral-status athletes entered in those Games and their medal efficiency. Finally, summarize key IOC conditions for AIN participation in 2026.\nThe material collected to date lets us nail down about 75 percent of what the user asked for.\n\nA. What we now know with solid sources  \n\n1. Totals by Games for the two neutral delegations  \n\u2022 PyeongChang 2018 \u2013 \u201cOlympic Athletes from Russia\u201d (OAR): 17 medals (2 G, 6 S, 9 B). No Belarusian competitors were neutral that year. (CNN, 2 Feb 2022)  \n\u2022 Beijing 2022 \u2013 \u201cRussian Olympic Committee\u201d (ROC): 32 medals (6 G, 12 S, 14 B). Belarus\u2019 two medals came under its own flag and are therefore out of scope. (ESPN medal tracker; CNN 2 Feb 2022)  \n\n2. Delegation sizes (eligible athletes)  \n\u2022 OAR 2018: 168 athletes (CNN, 2 Feb 2022)  \n\u2022 ROC 2022: 212 athletes (CNN, 2 Feb 2022)  \n\n   Overall medal-efficiency (medals \u00f7 athletes)  \n   \u2013 2018: 17 \u2044 168 \u2248 0.10  \n   \u2013 2022: 32 \u2044 212 \u2248 0.15  \n\n3. IOC conditions for the new \u201cIndividual Neutral Athlete\u201d (AIN) category that will apply in 2026 \u2013 all main points located and cross-checked (NBC-New York, 31 Jan 2026; SB Nation, 6 Feb 2026):  \n   \u2022 Each applicant vetted by the IOC\u2019s AIN Eligibility Review Panel.  \n   \u2022 No contract with Russian/Belarusian armed forces or security services; no public support for the war in Ukraine.  \n   \u2022 Team events and relays barred; only individual events allowed.  \n   \u2022 Uniform: plain white with \u201cAIN\u201d badge; no flag or anthem \u2013 Olympic anthem is used.  \n   \u2022 No marching in Opening Ceremony; possible joint participation in Closing.  \n   \u2022 Each athlete must sign the IOC \u201cConditions of Participation\u201d; final clearance by the IOC Executive Board.  \n\nThose bullet points satisfy the final part of the user\u2019s request (\u201csummarize key IOC conditions for AIN participation in 2026\u201d).\n\nB. What is still missing \u2013 and why it matters to the user\u2019s modelling effort  \n\n1. Medal breakdown by sport for OAR 2018.  \n2. Medal breakdown by sport for ROC 2022.  \n3. Number of neutral-status athletes entered in each sport at both Games so that per-sport medal-efficiency can be calculated.  \n\nThe NBC, CNN, ESPN and other news-article snippets retrieved so far give overall medal counts only. None reproduces the sport-by-sport tables that appear on the relevant Wikipedia pages (\u201cOlympic Athletes from Russia at the 2018 Winter Olympics\u201d and \u201cRussian Olympic Committee at the 2022 Winter Olympics\u201d) or in the IOC\u2019s official Results Books. These tables list both (a) medals by discipline and (b) roster size by discipline \u2013 exactly the data still required.\n\nC. Why another targeted search round is needed  \n\nWithout the missing sport-level numbers we cannot:  \n\u2022 show, for example, that OAR\u2019s 2018 ice-hockey squad of 25 athletes produced one gold, or that ROC\u2019s 2022 cross-country squad of 23 athletes yielded 9 medals, etc.;  \n\u2022 compute sport-specific medal-efficiency, which the question explicitly asks for.  \n\nD. Recommended next step  \n\nRun one more search explicitly aimed at the official team pages or the IOC Results Books, which are known to include both the medal-by-sport matrix and the athlete-entries-by-sport table.</Agent_report>\n"
