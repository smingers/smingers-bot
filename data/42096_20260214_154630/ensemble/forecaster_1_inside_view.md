## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**

1. **Indonesian Enforcement Action (July 2025):** Multiple independent sources (IMB, ReCAAP, ABC) confirm arrest of two gangs led to dramatic decline in Singapore Straits incidents in H2 2025. ReCAAP specifically quantifies 87% of incidents occurred before August. This is a structural change with demonstrated impact over 6+ months.
   - **Direction:** Strongly suggests lower Q1 2026 vs Q1 2025
   - **Magnitude:** Singapore Straits was 58% of global incidents in 2025; if this region remains suppressed, global total should decline significantly

2. **Real-time Q1 2026 Data:** EUNAVFOR reports two incidents off Somalia in February 2026 (Feb 9, 17). We are 44 days into Q1 2026 (as of Feb 14), representing ~49% of the quarter.
   - **Direction:** Provides actual floor for Q1 2026 count (minimum 2 incidents so far)
   - **Extrapolation:** If incident rate continues at ~1 per week in Somalia alone, plus other regions, suggests moderate activity level

**Moderate Evidence:**

1. **Gulf of Guinea Persistence:** December 2025 kidnapping incident and IMB data showing 21 incidents in 2025 (up from 18 in 2024) suggests this region remains active despite overall improvements.
   - **Direction:** Provides floor for expected incidents
   - **Magnitude:** If Gulf of Guinea maintains ~21 annual incidents, Q1 share would be ~5-6 incidents

2. **Economic Drivers:** Multiple experts (Nguyen, Ng, Reinold) identify economic hardship and organized crime as root causes. These structural factors unlikely to change dramatically in Q1 2026.
   - **Direction:** Suggests incidents won't drop to zero, but doesn't predict increase
   - **Magnitude:** Provides rationale for baseline activity level

3. **Historical Q1 Pattern:** Q1 2025 (45) was 67% higher than Q1 2024 (33), which was 22% higher than Q1 2023 (27). Three-year upward trend.
   - **Direction:** Suggests underlying upward pressure
   - **Counter-evidence:** This trend was driven by Singapore Straits surge that has since been curtailed

**Weak Evidence:**

1. **Adaptive Criminal Behavior:** Speculation that gangs might relocate or change tactics after enforcement.
   - **Direction:** Could push incidents up, but no concrete evidence yet
   - **Magnitude:** Uncertain

2. **Reporting Delays:** IMB notes concern about late reporting, but unclear how this affects Q1 2026 specifically.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** Q1 2026 = January 1 - March 31, 2026 (90 days total)

**Current Status (as of February 14, 2026):**
- 44 days elapsed (~49% of quarter)
- 46 days remaining (~51% of quarter)
- We have confirmed at least 2 incidents (Somalia, Feb 9 and 17)

**If Timeframe Were Halved (45 days = ~1.5 months):**
- Would expect ~15-20 incidents based on historical monthly rates
- Less time for enforcement effects to potentially weaken
- Prediction would shift down by ~40-50%

**If Timeframe Were Doubled (180 days = ~6 months):**
- Would approximate H1 2026
- More time for potential gang adaptation or new hotspots
- More seasonal variation possible
- Prediction would shift up by ~80-100% (not quite double due to potential seasonal effects)

## (d) Justification for Distribution Shift

**Key Factors Shifting from Outside View Base Rate:**

1. **Enforcement Impact is Demonstrable and Sustained:** The July 2025 arrests have now shown 7+ months of sustained impact (Aug 2025-Feb 2026). This is not a temporary disruption but appears to be a structural change. Singapore Straits represented 58% of 2025 incidents; if this region runs at 30-40% of Q1 2025 levels, global total should decline proportionally.

2. **We Have Real Q1 2026 Data:** Unlike the outside view which was purely historical, we now have 49% of Q1 2026 elapsed with at least 2 confirmed incidents. This provides a concrete floor and allows for more accurate extrapolation.

3. **Regional Mix Has Changed:** The outside view didn't account for the dramatic shift in regional distribution. Q1 2025's 45 incidents were heavily weighted toward Singapore Straits (likely ~25-30 of the 45). With that region suppressed, even if other regions maintain activity, the total should be lower.

**Calculation:**
- If Singapore Straits runs at 35% of Q1 2025 rate: ~9 incidents (vs ~26 in Q1 2025)
- If other regions maintain Q1 2025 levels: ~19 incidents
- Total: ~28 incidents

However, there's uncertainty around:
- Whether enforcement remains effective through Q1 2026
- Whether other regions increase (Gulf of Guinea showed slight uptick)
- Whether new hotspots emerge
- Reporting completeness

**Distribution Calibration:**

Given we're 49% through Q1 2026 with 2 confirmed incidents, extrapolating linearly suggests ~4 incidents by quarter end if rate continues. However, this seems too low given:
- Historical Q1 minimum is 27 (2023)
- Other regions (Gulf of Guinea, Indonesia, etc.) will contribute
- Not all incidents may be reported yet

More realistic scenario:
- **Best case (10th percentile):** Enforcement highly effective, no new hotspots, minimal Gulf of Guinea activity = ~22 incidents
- **Central case (median ~37):** Enforcement moderately effective, Singapore Straits at ~40% of Q1 2025, other regions stable = ~32-38 incidents
- **Worst case (90th percentile):** Enforcement weakens, gang adaptation, Gulf of Guinea surge = ~50 incidents

**Adjustment from Outside View:**
The outside view median was 38, which seems reasonable. However, the real-time data showing only 2 incidents in first 49% of quarter suggests we're tracking below the pace needed for 38 (would need ~4 by now). This argues for shifting the distribution slightly lower.

Conversely, incidents may cluster (not evenly distributed), and reporting delays mean the true count could be higher. The February Somalia incidents suggest some activity is occurring.

**Final Calibration:**
I'll shift slightly lower than outside view but maintain wide uncertainty bands:
- 10th percentile: 22 (vs 24 outside view) - reflects strong enforcement persistence
- Median: 35 (vs 38 outside view) - reflects current run rate plus some clustering
- 90th percentile: 48 (same as outside view) - maintains upside risk for gang adaptation

Distribution calibration:

**Central Tendency Reasoning:**
With 44 days elapsed and 2 confirmed incidents, the current run rate is ~0.045 incidents/day, which extrapolates to ~4 total for the quarter. This is clearly too low - historical minimum is 27. The discrepancy suggests either:
1. Incidents cluster later in quarters (no strong evidence)
2. Reporting delays (moderate evidence)
3. We're in an unusually quiet period that will normalize (moderate evidence)

Given Singapore Straits represented ~58% of 2025 incidents and is now suppressed to ~13% of prior rate (87% occurred in first 7 months, so H2 ran at ~13% of H1 rate), I estimate:
- Singapore Straits Q1 2026: ~8-12 incidents (vs ~26 in Q1 2025)
- Other regions Q1 2026: ~20-25 incidents (vs ~19 in Q1 2025)
- Total: ~28-37 incidents

This suggests a median around 33-35, slightly below the outside view median of 38.

**Tail Calibration:**
- **10th percentile (22):** Requires enforcement to be even more effective than H2 2025, plus no uptick in other regions. Possible but optimistic.
- **90th percentile (48):** Requires either enforcement collapse or significant new hotspot emergence. Given 7 months of sustained enforcement success, this seems like appropriate upside risk.

**Distribution Shape:**
Given the enforcement intervention is proven but could weaken, I expect a slightly right-skewed distribution (more upside than downside risk from median). The 10th-90th range of 26 incidents (22-48) provides appropriate uncertainty.

Checklist:

1. **Target Variable:** Number of maritime piracy & armed robbery incidents reported by IMB for Q1 2026 (Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2026). Units: incidents.
   ✓ Analysis aligns with this exact criteria.

2. **Outside View Base Rate:** 10th: 24, Median: 38, 90th: 48 based on 2018-2025 Q1 historical data.
   ✓ My final prediction is rooted to this but adjusted downward based on enforcement effects and real-time data showing lower run rate.

3. **Consistency Check:** Implied median = 35; mean ≈ 36. This makes sense given Singapore Straits suppression (58% of 2025 incidents) should reduce Q1 2026 below Q1 2025's 45 but not to 2023's trough of 27. Aligns with enforcement impact persisting but not eliminating all activity.

4. **Three Most Significant Evidence Pieces:**
   - Indonesian police arrested two gangs July 2025; 87% of Singapore Straits incidents occurred before August (ReCAAP, IMB confirmed)
   - Real-time data: 2 confirmed incidents in first 49% of Q1 2026 (EUNAVFOR reports)
   - Singapore Straits was 58% of 2025 global incidents; suppression there drives global decline (IMB data)
   ✓ All factually verified from authoritative sources.

5. **Blind-spot Scenario:** Enforcement weakens or gangs successfully adapt/relocate in late February-March, causing surge in final 6 weeks. This would push outcome UP toward 45-50 range. Alternatively, major underreporting due to delays could mean actual incidents higher than reported by April resolution.

6. **Status Quo Outcome:** Q1 2025 = 45 incidents. However, H2 2025 showed dramatic decline after enforcement action. The "new status quo" post-July 2025 is lower activity (~13% of prior rate in Singapore Straits). My prediction of 35 median reflects this new equilibrium rather than reverting to Q1 2025's elevated level.

7. **Technicalities:** 
   ✓ Percentiles strictly increasing: 22 < 28 < 33 < 37 < 43 < 48
   ✓ Units: incidents (as requested)
   ✓ Values within bounds: lower bound 14.5, upper bound 45.5 - my 10th (22) is above lower bound, 90th (48) exceeds upper bound which is permitted per question
