Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**IMB/ICC-CCS Official Sources (January 2026):**
- The 2025 annual report is the primary authoritative source, showing 137 total incidents with 45 in Q1 2025
- Quality: Highest - this is the resolution authority itself
- Key facts: Singapore Straits dominated with 80 incidents (58% of global), significant decline in H2 2025 after Indonesian police arrests in July
- Expert opinions from John Denton (ICC Secretary General) and Michael Howlett (IMB Director) emphasize sustained cooperation needs but provide no quantitative forecasts

**ReCAAP ISC Report (via MarineLink, January 11, 2026):**
- Reports 132 incidents in Asia for 2025, with 108 in Singapore Straits
- Quality: High - ReCAAP is an official intergovernmental organization
- Key fact: 87% of Singapore Straits incidents occurred January-July 2025, with significant decline August-December following arrests
- Expert opinion from Vijay Chafekar notes incidents were "minor petty theft" and "deterrent effect of effective enforcement"
- Note: ReCAAP numbers (132 Asia total) differ slightly from IMB global totals, suggesting different counting methodologies

**DefenceWeb & FreightNews (January 2026):**
- Quality: Medium - secondary sources citing IMB data
- Confirm the same statistics as IMB official report
- No additional quantitative insights beyond IMB data

**Agent Report on Historical Q1 Data:**
- Quality: High for compilation, though notes data gaps
- Provides crucial Q1 historical series: 2018(66), 2019(38), 2020(47), 2021(38), 2022(37), 2023(27), 2024(33), 2025(45)
- Identifies +22% CAGR from 2023-2025 in Q1 incidents
- Notes concentration in two distinct phenomena: Singapore Straits opportunistic theft and Gulf of Guinea violent incidents

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Q1 incidents 2018-2025 (8 years):** 66, 38, 47, 38, 37, 27, 33, 45
   - Mean: 41.4, Median: 38, Std Dev: 11.3
   - Suitability: Good - directly comparable timeframe and definition

2. **Recent Q1 trend 2023-2025 (3 years):** 27, 33, 45
   - Shows clear upward trajectory (+22% CAGR)
   - Suitability: High - most recent and reflects current dynamics

3. **All quarters 2023-2025 (12 quarters):** Q1-Q4 increments of 27, -, 72, 21 (2023); 33, 27, 19, 37 (2024); 45, 45, 26, 21 (2025)
   - Q1 as % of annual: 22.5% (2023), 28.4% (2024), 32.8% (2025)
   - Suitability: Medium - shows Q1 is typically 23-33% of annual total

**Chosen Reference Class:** Q1 incidents 2018-2025, with heavy weighting toward the 2023-2025 upward trend, adjusted for known enforcement actions.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** Q1 2026 = January 1 - March 31, 2026 (approximately 1.5-3.5 months from February 14, 2026)

**Historical Q1 Patterns:**
- Q1 2025 (45) was 67% higher than Q1 2024 (33)
- Q1 2024 (33) was 22% higher than Q1 2023 (27)
- The 2023-2025 period shows consistent Q1 growth
- Singapore Straits drove much of 2025's increase (80 annual incidents, heavily front-loaded to H1)

**Seasonal Factors:**
- Q1 historically represents 22-33% of annual totals in recent years
- No strong evidence that Q1 is systematically higher or lower than other quarters
- Weather patterns in key regions (Singapore Straits, Gulf of Guinea) are relatively stable year-round

## (d) Justification

**Key Factors Supporting Lower Q1 2026 Count (vs. Q1 2025's 45):**

1. **Enforcement Impact:** Indonesian Marine Police arrested two gangs in July 2025, leading to dramatic decline in Singapore Straits incidents in H2 2025. ReCAAP noted 87% of Singapore Straits incidents occurred before August 2025.

2. **Base Effect:** Q1 2025's 45 incidents was elevated partly due to Singapore Straits surge that was subsequently curtailed. If enforcement remains effective, Q1 2026 should reflect the lower H2 2025 run rate.

3. **Mean Reversion:** The 8-year Q1 average is 41.4, and Q1 2025's 45 was above this level.

**Key Factors Supporting Higher Q1 2026 Count:**

1. **Underlying Trend:** The 2023-2025 upward trajectory suggests structural factors (economic conditions, patrol gaps) may persist.

2. **Gulf of Guinea:** 21 incidents in 2025 (up from 18 in 2024) with continued crew kidnappings suggests this region remains active.

3. **Adaptive Criminal Behavior:** Gangs may adapt to enforcement, potentially relocating or changing tactics.

**Synthesis:**
The most likely scenario is Q1 2026 falls between the suppressed H2 2025 levels and the elevated Q1 2025 peak. If we estimate H2 2025 Singapore Straits ran at ~30-35% of the H1 rate (given the 87% concentration in first 7 months), and this continues into Q1 2026, we'd expect roughly 30-40 incidents globally. However, uncertainty remains high given potential for:
- Resurgence if enforcement lapses
- New hotspots emerging
- Reporting changes
- Weather or economic shocks

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring to Historical Distribution:**
- 8-year Q1 range: 27-66 incidents
- Recent 3-year range: 27-45 incidents
- Mean: 41.4, Median: 38

**Calibration Considerations:**

1. **Central Tendency:** Given enforcement effects, I expect Q1 2026 to be below Q1 2025's 45 but above the 2023 trough of 27. A central estimate around 35-38 seems reasonable (near the historical median).

2. **Downside Risk (10th percentile):** If enforcement is highly effective and no new hotspots emerge, we could see levels approaching Q1 2023's 27 or even lower. Setting 10th percentile at 24 accounts for potential over-performance of enforcement.

3. **Upside Risk (90th percentile):** If gangs adapt quickly, enforcement lapses, or new regions flare up, we could match or exceed Q1 2025. However, the dramatic H2 2025 decline suggests 45+ is less likely. Setting 90th percentile at 48 accounts for potential resurgence plus new threats.

4. **Distribution Shape:** Given the enforcement intervention is recent (July 2025), there's asymmetric risk - more likely to see moderate decline than dramatic increase. This suggests a slightly right-skewed distribution centered around 35-38.

5. **Unknown Unknowns:** Maritime piracy can be affected by geopolitical events, economic crises, or natural disasters. Wide 10th-90th range (24-48) provides 24-incident spread to account for these uncertainties.
