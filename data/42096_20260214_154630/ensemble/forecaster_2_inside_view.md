Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary IMB/ICC Sources:**
1. **ICC-CCS (Jan 21, 2026)** - Official IMB annual report for 2025. Reports 137 total incidents, 45 in Q1 2025. Highest quality factual source. Confirms Singapore Straits had 80 incidents (58% of global), with sharp decline in H2 2025 after Indonesian arrests in July.

2. **Marine Insight (Jan 21, 2026)** - Republishes IMB data with identical statistics. Reinforces the July 2025 gang arrests as key turning point.

3. **Multiple news sources (Jan 15-16, 2026)** - Guardian, Le Marin, Mer et Marine, Ouest France all report same IMB figures. Consistent factual reporting.

**Regional/Analytical Sources:**
4. **ABC Australia (Sep 20, 2025)** - Reports 95 incidents in Asia Jan-Jun 2025 (83% increase YoY) per ReCAAP. Expert opinions from Thu Nguyen (NUS), Daniel Ng (Vanguard-Tech), Maximilian Reinold identify economic hardship, organized crime, and depleted fish stocks as drivers. Moderate quality; experts identifiable but represents mid-2025 snapshot.

5. **CZAPP (date unclear, likely mid-2025)** - Reports 80 incidents in Singapore Straits H1 2025, 400% YoY increase. Notes shift from CAT 4 to CAT 3 severity. Moderate quality analytical piece.

6. **EUNAVFOR Atalanta (Feb 2026)** - Reports two suspected piracy incidents off Somalia in February 2026. Weak relevance (Somalia contributes <5% of global incidents) but shows some activity continuing.

7. **Steamshipmutual PDF** - Corrupted/unreadable. Disregarded.

**Evidence Quality Assessment:**
- **Strong factual basis**: IMB 2025 annual data (137 total, 45 Q1, 80 Singapore Straits)
- **Strong causal mechanism**: Indonesian gang arrests in July 2025 → sharp H2 decline in Singapore Straits
- **Moderate evidence**: Expert consensus on economic drivers and organized crime structure
- **Weak forward-looking**: No direct Q1 2026 data yet (we're only 14 days into the quarter)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (large shifts warranted):**
1. **Singapore Straits suppression effect** - Multiple independent sources (IMB, ReCAAP, Marine Insight) confirm Indonesian arrests in July 2025 led to dramatic H2 decline. Singapore Straits contributed ~58% of 2025 incidents. If suppression persists, could reduce Q1 2026 by 10-15 incidents vs. naïve trend.

2. **Structural enforcement improvement** - Arrests of organized gangs (not just opportunistic individuals) suggests disruption of criminal infrastructure. Expert Daniel Ng identified WhatsApp coordination and organized structure. This is harder to reconstitute quickly.

**Moderate Evidence (moderate shifts):**
1. **Economic drivers persist** - Experts cite pandemic tourism collapse, depleted fish stocks, economic hardship. These haven't resolved, suggesting baseline criminal motivation remains. However, enforcement can suppress even when motivation exists.

2. **Q1 2025 = 45 incidents** - This represents the high-water mark before July arrests. A return to this level would require gang reconstitution or new actors emerging.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Somalia activity** - Two incidents in Feb 2026, but historically Somalia contributes minimal share (<5%). Doesn't materially affect global total.

2. **Gulf of Guinea stability** - 21 incidents in 2025 vs. 18 in 2024. Modest increase but small absolute numbers.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: Q1 2026 = Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2026. We are 14 days into the quarter (Feb 14). Resolution occurs ~72 days from now when IMB publishes Q1 report (likely late April).

**Critical consideration**: We have **zero direct observation** of Jan-Feb 2026 incident rates. The most recent data point is full-year 2025.

**If timeframe halved (45 days remaining)**: Would increase uncertainty slightly as less time for patterns to emerge, but wouldn't fundamentally change analysis since we're predicting the full Q1 anyway.

**If timeframe doubled (6 months)**: Would need to consider H1 2026, requiring assessment of whether Singapore Straits suppression persists through summer. Would likely see mean reversion toward historical averages.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view baseline**: μ ≈ 44, 10th-90th range 30-60

**Key factors warranting adjustment:**

1. **Downward pressure (-5 to -8 incidents)**: 
   - Singapore Straits represented 80 of 137 (58%) global incidents in 2025
   - Post-arrest H2 2025 saw "significant decline" per IMB
   - If Q1 2026 Singapore Straits incidents return to 2024 Q1 levels (~15-20) instead of 2025 Q1 levels (~35-40), that's a 15-20 incident reduction
   - However, other regions may partially compensate

2. **Upward pressure (+3 to +5 incidents)**:
   - Three-year Q1 trend: 27→33→45 shows momentum
   - Economic drivers (hardship, depleted fisheries) remain unresolved
   - Gulf of Guinea showing modest uptick
   - Organized crime may adapt/reconstitute over 6+ months since July arrests

3. **Net adjustment**: Moderate downward shift of -3 to -5 from outside view median
   - New median: ~40 (vs. 44 outside view)
   - Rationale: Enforcement effects typically persist for 2-3 quarters before adaptation, but won't eliminate all activity

**Why reference class remains relevant**: 
- No fundamental change in reporting methodology
- Same geographic hotspots active
- Economic/structural drivers similar to 2023-2025 period
- Enforcement success is significant but not unprecedented (similar patterns seen after other regional crackdowns)

## Distribution Calibration

**Central tendency**: 
- Median: 40 (down from 44 outside view, reflecting Singapore Straits suppression)
- Mean: ~41 (slightly above median due to right-tail risk of gang reconstitution)

**Tail considerations**:
- **Lower tail (10th percentile)**: Could go as low as 28 if Singapore Straits suppression is highly effective AND other regions remain quiet. This would be ~20% below 2023 Q1 (lowest recent observation of 27).

- **Upper tail (90th percentile)**: Could reach 56 if (a) organized crime rapidly reconstitutes in Singapore Straits, (b) Gulf of Guinea escalates, or (c) Somalia sees unexpected resurgence. This is below the naïve trend extrapolation of ~54 but acknowledges possibility enforcement effects fade quickly.

**Distribution shape**: Slightly right-skewed due to organized crime reconstitution risk, but less skewed than outside view due to demonstrated enforcement capability.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Number of maritime piracy & armed robbery incidents reported by IMB for Q1 2026 (Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2026). Units: incidents.

2. **Outside view base**: μ ≈ 44, range 30-60. My prediction shifts median down to 40 due to strong evidence of Singapore Straits suppression post-July 2025 arrests.

3. **Consistency**: Implied median = 40; mean ≈ 41. Reasonable given enforcement effects typically persist 2-3 quarters but don't eliminate activity entirely.

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - IMB confirms 80 Singapore Straits incidents (58% of global) in 2025 with H2 decline post-arrests
   - Indonesian gang arrests in July 2025 disrupted organized criminal infrastructure
   - Q1 2025 baseline was 45 incidents (pre-enforcement peak)
   - Economic drivers (hardship, depleted fisheries) remain unresolved per multiple experts
   - Three-year Q1 upward trend (27→33→45) suggests underlying momentum

5. **Blind spot**: Criminal gangs reconstitute faster than expected (2-3 months vs. 6+ months), leading to Singapore Straits resurgence in Feb-Mar 2026. This would push outcome toward 50-55 range.

6. **Status quo**: Most recent Q1 was 45. However, structural change (gang arrests) occurred mid-2025, making 40 a more appropriate status quo than simple repetition.

7. **Technicalities**: Values strictly increasing, units = incidents, all within bounds.
