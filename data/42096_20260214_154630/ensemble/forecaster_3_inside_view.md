Analysis:
**1) Target variable / resolution criteria (what will be counted)**
This resolves to the **number of IMB-reported maritime piracy & armed robbery incidents occurring in “Q1 2026”**, per the **IMB Q1 2026 quarterly report** (units: incidents).  
**Technicality:** Per the question’s fine print, **events before the forecast opening date (2026-02-14) do not count toward resolution**, even though they are in calendar Q1. I therefore treat the effective window as **2026-02-14 through 2026-03-31** (reported in the Q1 2026 report).

## (a) Source analysis (what each source says, quality, date)

1) **ICC/IMB annual release (Jan 2026) — “Global maritime piracy and armed robbery increased in 2025”**  
   - **What it provides (facts):** 2025 total **137**; Q1 2025 cumulative **45** (from table); regional split highlighting **Singapore Straits 80 incidents in 2025**, Gulf of Guinea **21**, Indonesia **12**, Somalia small but nonzero; notes **decline in H2 2025** after **July 2025 arrests**.  
   - **Quality:** Primary/near-primary (IMB/ICC); high credibility.  
   - **Usefulness:** Strong for baseline levels and the major structural “Singapore Straits surge + crackdown” narrative.

2) **IMB PRC informational page (undated general page)**  
   - **What it provides:** Definitions and how reporting works (in situ reporting to PRC).  
   - **Quality:** Primary; high credibility.  
   - **Usefulness:** Helps interpret reporting/measurement stability; not directly predictive.

3) **ABC Australia article (Sep 2025)**  
   - **What it provides (facts/opinions):** ReCAAP-referenced surge in Malacca/Singapore area; qualitative mechanisms (opportunistic theft, jurisdictional issues, under-reporting).  
   - **Quality:** Reputable outlet; some reliance on experts and ReCAAP; medium-high.  
   - **Usefulness:** Supports mechanism for Singapore Straits incidents being largely opportunistic and sensitive to enforcement.

4) **CZAPP analyst piece (H1 2025)**  
   - **What it provides:** ReCAAP-derived counts; emphasizes SOMS concentration and severity mix.  
   - **Quality:** Secondary but data-driven; moderate.  
   - **Usefulness:** Reinforces that 2025 spike was highly concentrated and (likely) responsive to policing.

5) **News/secondary reprints (Marine Insight, Guardian.ng, Ouest France, Mer et Marine, Le Marin; Jan 2026)**  
   - **What it provides:** Mostly restates IMB 2025 numbers and the “H2 decline after arrests” point.  
   - **Quality:** Mixed; but consistent with IMB press release; moderate.  
   - **Usefulness:** Corroboration; not independent new quantitative data.

6) **Newsbase (Dec 2025) on Gulf of Guinea kidnapping incident**  
   - **What it provides:** Illustrative incident + risk-firm commentary; notes definitional differences across trackers.  
   - **Quality:** Reasonable trade reporting; moderate.  
   - **Usefulness:** Confirms Gulf of Guinea capability persists (tail risk upward), but doesn’t imply a step-change in global counts.

7) **Maritime-Executive/EUNAVFOR Atalanta article (Feb 2025)**  
   - **What it provides:** A prior-year Somalia incident pattern.  
   - **Quality:** Reasonable; but dated and not directly informative for 2026.  
   - **Usefulness:** Weak for Q1 2026 forecast except as background that Somalia can “re-activate.”

(AskNews items shown beyond the piracy-specific ones are irrelevant to maritime piracy; I ignore them.)

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

**Strong evidence**
- **Measurement anchor + recent level:** IMB’s own 2023–2025 quarterly/annual counts (e.g., **Q1 2025 = 45**, 2025 total 137). (Primary, consistent time series.)
- **Structural driver + intervention:** IMB’s explicit statement that **Singapore Straits dominated 2025 (80 incidents)** and that incidents **declined after July 2025 Indonesian arrests**. (Clear causal mechanism: enforcement disrupts opportunistic gangs.)

**Moderate evidence**
- **Concentration/seasonality hints:** ReCAAP-based reporting (via ABC/CZAPP) that the SOMS spike was intense and then eased; suggests **Q1 2026 likely below Q1 2025** if enforcement persists.
- **Persistent secondary hotspot:** Gulf of Guinea remains capable of kidnappings/attacks; could add variance/right-tail risk even if SOMS cools.

**Weak evidence**
- Any single “notable incident” articles as predictors of quarterly totals (they illustrate capability but don’t robustly predict global IMB totals).
- Speculation about reporting fatigue/under-reporting changes (possible, but not evidenced here as a new regime shift for Q1 2026).

## (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Effective window (per fine print):** **46 days** remaining in Q1 (from **2026-02-14 to 2026-03-31**). Resolution known when IMB releases its Q1 2026 report (by late April).
- **If timeframe were halved (~23 days):** I’d scale my central estimate down roughly ~40–50% (incidents are somewhat “flow-like”), so median would drop from ~18 to ~10–11.
- **If timeframe were doubled (~92 days):** Roughly ~2× the incidents (median ~35–38), similar to a full-quarter expectation absent major regime change.

## (d) Justification (inside view adjustment from outside view)

**Outside view base rate distribution given:**  
P10=28, P20=32, P40=36, P60=39, P80=43, P90=48 (this is implicitly for a *full* Q1).

**Key adjustment #1: resolution-window truncation (major mechanical shift downward).**  
If the counted window is only **~51% of the quarter**, a first-pass mechanical scaling takes the outside-view median (~37–39) down to **~19–20**.

**Key adjustment #2: post-crackdown Singapore Straits environment (moderate downward).**  
Since **Singapore Straits were ~58% of 2025 incidents** and IMB reports a **material decline after July 2025 arrests**, I modestly reduce the scaled expectation further (i.e., fewer incidents per day than “average Q1 2025 conditions”). This pushes the central tendency from ~19–20 toward **~17–18**.

**Key adjustment #3: offsetting right-tail risks (keeps upper tail meaningfully wide).**
- A rebound/adaptation by gangs in SOMS, or displacement to nearby waters, could lift counts.
- Gulf of Guinea capability persists; a small cluster of incidents could add several counts quickly.
So I keep a **wide 80–90th percentile** (not overly compressed by the scaling).

**Net:** My inside-view median lands around **18 incidents** for the **Feb 14–Mar 31** effective window, with meaningful uncertainty.

Distribution calibration
- **Trend-continued (naïve) scenario:** If Q1 2025-like conditions continued *and* we scaled to 46 days, we’d get roughly **~23** (45 * 46/90).  
- **My central scenario:** Enforcement effects reduce the per-day rate versus early 2025 → **~18**.  
- **Uncertainty/tails:**  
  - Low outcome scenario: sustained deterrence + quiet Gulf of Guinea/Somalia → low teens.  
  - High outcome scenario: SOMS resurgence + a handful of GoG incidents → high 20s / low 30s.

So I shift the outside view (full-quarter) distribution down mechanically and then slightly further down in the center, while retaining a fat-ish right tail.

Checklist:
1) **Paraphrase:** IMB-reported piracy/armed-robbery **incident count (incidents)** in the counted Q1 2026 window (**post-2026-02-14 through 2026-03-31 per fine print**), per IMB Q1 2026 report.  
2) **Outside view base rate (given):** P10 28, P20 32, P40 36, P60 39, P80 43, P90 48 (full Q1).  
3) **Consistency check:** Implied median ≈ between P40/P60 ≈ **18–19**; mean ≈ **~20–21** due to right tail; consistent with truncation + partial enforcement effect.  
4) **Top evidence (<=20 words each):**
   - IMB: **2025 total 137; Singapore Straits 80; H2 decline after July 2025 arrests.**
   - Historical Q1 totals: **27 (2023), 33 (2024), 45 (2025)**.
   - Fine print: **events before 2026-02-14 do not count**, truncating the quarter by ~49%.  
5) **Blind spot:** If resolution actually uses **full calendar Q1 (Jan–Mar)** despite the fine print, my forecast is too low.  
6) **Status quo:** Modest cooling from late-2025 enforcement persists; counts near scaled-down recent rates.  
7) **Technicalities:** Percentiles strictly increasing; units in incidents; tails wide; allow below 14.5 and above 45.5 if needed (not required here).
