Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)

1. Marine Insight / Guardian / Le Marin (Jan 2026) – Primary press-release derivatives quoting the IMB 2025 annual report (137 global incidents; 80 in Singapore Straits; 21 Gulf of Guinea). Factual, dated, high quality, little opinion beyond IMB/ICC officials.
2. ABC Australia & Czapp (Sep 2025 & Jul 2025) – Quote ReCAAP data (Asian regional agency): 80 incidents in SOMS H1 2025 (+400% YoY). Reliable, but different definition set; useful trend signal.
3. Yahoo News-TW & Dagbladet (Oct & Nov 2025) – Summarise IMB Q1-Q3 2025 update (116 incidents; 73 in Singapore Strait). Secondary, but figures match IMB release.
4. Maritime-Executive (Feb 2025) – Somali coast incidents; credible but small numbers.
5. Misc. AskNews crime articles – National crime stories (Colombia, Moscow, Belarus, etc.). Not maritime; irrelevant.

Quality weighting: IMB > ReCAAP > other maritime specialists (Marine Executive) >> general media.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• IMB: Q4 2025 increment only 21 incidents – clear factual fall after mid-year arrests.  
• Multiple sources: Singapore Straits incidents plunged after July 2025 police action.  
Moderate evidence  
• Gulf of Guinea kidnaps continue (Dec 2025 LPG carrier) – risk persistent but low frequency.  
• ReCAAP momentum in Asia showed steep H1 rise then H2 drop – indicates volatility.  
Weak evidence  
• Single Somali episodes; anecdotal speculation of economic hardship driving piracy.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• 46 days remain in Q1 2026 (14 Feb → 31 Mar). IMB report expected mid-April.  
• If the forecast window were halved (23 days left), uncertainty would shrink slightly; I would tighten the middle of the distribution by ~2 incidents.  
• If doubled (92 days), uncertainty would expand; I would widen tails by ~4–5 incidents.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
Base-rate (2018-2025 Q1 series 66, 38, 47, 38, 37, 27, 33, 45) gives median ≈38.  
Updates that push DOWN:  
• Hot-spot Singapore Straits (58 % of 2025 total) now under enhanced patrols; Q4 average ≈2 incidents/month vs ≈12 in H1.  
• No contrary surge signs in Jan-Feb 2026 press.  
Updates that push UP:  
• Gulf of Guinea kidnaps inching up (23 crew kidnapped in 2025; fresh case Dec 2025).  
Net: expect Q1 2026 below Q1 2025 (45) but above the 2023 trough (27). Tilt median to low-30s while retaining fat right tail for sudden flare-ups (e.g., enforcement lapse in SOMS).

Distribution calibration
10th percentile: 22 incidents  
20th percentile: 26 incidents  
40th percentile: 31 incidents  
60th percentile: 36 incidents  
80th percentile: 42 incidents  
90th percentile: 50 incidents

Checklist:
1. Target variable: Number of IMB-recorded global piracy & armed-robbery incidents occurring 1 Jan–31 Mar 2026.  
2. Outside-view distribution anchored on 2018-2025 Q1 series (see above).  
3. Consistency: implied median ≈33.5; mean ≈35–37 – reasonable relative to history and rationale.  
4. Key evidence: a) H2 2025 SOMS crackdown, b) Q4 2025 global drop, c) Gulf of Guinea steady low-level threat, d) lack of early-2026 spike reports.  
5. Blind-spot: Rapid copy-cat piracy rebound in SOMS in March could push incidents >55.  
6. Status-quo pull: without new waves, counts drift toward recent low 30s.  
7. Percentiles strictly ascending; units = incidents; within open bounds.
