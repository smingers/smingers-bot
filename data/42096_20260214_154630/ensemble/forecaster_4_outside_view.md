Analysis:

a) Source analysis  
1. “Global maritime piracy and armed robbery increased in 2025” – ICC-CCS news, 15 Jan 2026.  
   • Primary source (IMB press‐release). Gives the audited 2025 global total (137) and confirms Q4 2025 cumulative figures already visible in the table supplied with the question. Purely factual; very reliable.

2. “IMB remains cautiously optimistic …” – ICC-CCS, 14 Oct 2025.  
   • Short news note repeating the Q3 2025 cumulative total (116) and qualitative comments from IMB staff. Good factual quality but no new numbers for Q1 2026.

3. “Spike in armed robbery incidents raises concerns for Singapore Strait …” – ICC-CCS, 9 Jul 2025, and follow-up 24 Apr 2025.  
   • Descriptive articles explaining why Singapore Straits incidents surged in early-2025 and then fell after Indonesian arrests. The arrest narrative is an opinion/hypothesis but it is advanced by IMB itself, so it carries moderate weight.

4. “Maritime piracy dropped in 2024 …” – ICC-CCS, 14 Jan 2025.  
   • Earlier annual report; useful only to verify 2024 total (116) and Q1–Q4 values in the table. High factual reliability.

5. MarineLink (11 Jan 2026) – Summary of ReCAAP ISC 2025 Asian data.  
   • ReCAAP covers Asia only, uses a very similar definition. Gives detail on the Singapore/Malacca Straits decline after July-2025. Secondary source but reputable. Useful to gauge prospects for the single largest hotspot in Q1 2026.

6. DefenceWeb and FreightNews January-2026 articles – Press rewrites of the same IMB annual report. No extra data; factual consistency good.

7. IMO index page – Merely a list of PDFs, no data; ignored for quant work.

8. Agent report (compiled 2026-02-14) – Collates all publicly available IMB quarterly totals back to 2018. Provides the only Q1 figures for 2018-2022. Sources for each year are traceable to original IMB press releases; hence the data table is judged highly credible.

b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• All eight known global Q1 counts 2018-2025 (66, 38, 47, 38, 37, 27, 33, 45)  
• Only the “post-COVID period” 2021-2025 (38, 37, 27, 33, 45)  
• Annual totals converted to Q1 by using the observed Q1/annual ratio (but 2022 ratio is anomalous – 90 % – because Q2–Q4 numbers are missing).

The first class offers the longest run and shows the full volatility range (27–66). It captures one big upward shock (2018) and one trough (2023). Because we have no convincing evidence of a structural break in reporting rules, this is the best outside-view yard-stick. The five-year subset would under-represent tail risk.

c) Time-frame analysis  
• We are 46 days from the end of Q1 2026; 72 days from expected publication of the IMB Q1 report.  
• Eight historical Q1 observations span 2018-2025. Mean = 41.4, median = 38, st.dev. ≈ 11.  
• Year-on-year change distribution (2019→2025) = +8, +9, –9, 0, –10, +6, +12 (mean +2.3, st.dev. 8.5). So single-year swings of ±10 are normal.

d) Justification for outside-view number  
Trend signal: last three Q1s climbed 27→33→45 (+22 % then +36 %). A naïve trend extrapolation (+20 %) would give ≈54 incidents.  
Counter-pressure: ReCAAP data show a sharp fall in Singapore Straits incidents after July 2025 owing to Indonesian arrests; that hotspot supplied roughly half of the 2025 Q1 surge. If the deterrent effect persists during Jan–Mar 2026, it could shave 5-10 incidents off the naïve projection.  
Balance: Apply a mild upward drift to the long-run mean (41) but cap the central estimate below the trend-extrapolated 54. Resulting median ≈ 44.

Uncertainty: Historical 80 % range (10th–90th) computed from the eight-year sample is 31–57. Given the possibility that Singapore Straits criminal gangs regroup or, conversely, that enforcement continues to suppress incidents, I widen the tails slightly to 30–60.

Outside view calibration:
• Base distribution: normal with μ ≈ 44, σ ≈ 8, truncated at 0.  
• Convert to percentiles and widen tails by ~1 incident to acknowledge heavy-tail risk seen in 2018.  
• Cross-check: 10th–90th span (30–60) is ≈ ±1.75 σ, consistent with empirical frequency of upsets in this domain.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 30  
Percentile 20: 35  
Percentile 40: 40  
Percentile 60: 46  
Percentile 80: 53  
Percentile 90: 60
