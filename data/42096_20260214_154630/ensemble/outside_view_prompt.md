You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
How many maritime piracy & armed robbery incidents will the International Maritime Bureau report for Q1 2026?

Question background:
In its annual report, the [International Maritime Bureau](https://icc-ccs.org) (IMB) [reported](https://icc-ccs.org/global-maritime-piracy-and-armed-robbery-increased-in-2025/) 137 maritime piracy and armed robbery incidents for 2025. The incident count maintains a concerning upward trend in piracy from 2024 (116), 2023 (120) and 2022 (41).

The IMB tracks incidents through its [Piracy Reporting Centre](https://icc-ccs.org/imb-piracy-reporting-centre-2/) which largely relies on in situ reports:

> Establish in 1992, IMB PRC offers a 24-hour and free service for shipmasters to report any piracy, armed robbery or stowaway incidents.

Maritime piracy and armed robbery are defined in Article 101 of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and IMO Resolution A.1025 (26) respectively. Under the definition, incidents such as the Houthi attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea do not count.

Quarterly IMB data can be found below:

## Summary of Article

This article describes the IMB Piracy Reporting Centre (IMB PRC) and its operational framework.

**Key Facts:**

1. **Definitions Used**: The IMB PRC follows two official definitions:
   - Piracy: As defined in Article 101 of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS)
   - Armed Robbery: As defined in Resolution A. 1025 (26) adopted on December 2, 2009 at the 26th Assembly Session of the International Maritime Organisation (IMO)

2. **Historical Context**: Before 1992, shipmasters and ship operators had no dedicated resource to report attacks, robberies, or hijackings of their ships either in port or at sea. Local law enforcement reportedly either ignored reports or denied the existence of serious problems in their waters.

3. **Funding Model**: The IMB PRC services are free and funded purely by donations. Donations are acknowledged on their website and in quarterly and annual piracy and armed robbery reports.

**Note**: This article is primarily informational about the IMB PRC's structure and does not contain specific statistics, forecasts, or data about incident counts relevant to predicting Q1 2026 figures.

  – Philippines: 10 incidents (5 at Batangas anchorage)  
  – Malaysia (Sabah): 1 crew kidnapping  
  – Other regions: individual incidents off Benin, Ghana, Congo noted in IMB narrative

3.  Key observations for the 2018-2025 series

• Data availability: 2023-2025 are fully covered quarter-by-quarter; 2020-2022 have verified Q1 totals but lack other quarters; 2018-2019 have only Q1.  Thus, long-run seasonality analysis remains constrained.

• First-quarter trend: a trough at 27 incidents in 2023, then a clear rise to 33 in 2024 and 45 in 2025—aligning with the recent rebound in the annual totals (120 → 116 → 137).

• Regional patterns:  
  – Gulf of Guinea dominates serious violence (crew kidnaps) whenever figures are disclosed, even when its share of overall incidents fluctuates (43 % of events in Q1 2021 but only 19 % in Q1 2022).  
  – Singapore Straits incidents are numerous but classified by IMB as “petty theft/armed robbery”; they nonetheless account for roughly one-third of global Q1 cases in 2022 and 2023.  
  – Callao anchorage, Peru emerges from 2020 onward as a persistent hotspot in the Americas data slice.

• Methodological consistency: No press material points to definitional changes over the 2018-2025 horizon; IMB continues to count only piracy and armed robbery incidents that fit UNCLOS Art. 101 and IMO Res. A.1025(26).  Notably, Houthi missile/boat attacks in the Red Sea are excluded.

4.  Remaining information gaps

a. Authenticated Q2–Q4 counts for 2018-2022 (and Q2 2023).  These figures exist in the subscription-only PDF “IMB Piracy & Armed Robbery Report – Q x 20yy” series but are not quoted in open-access media.  

b. Any regional numeric breakdowns for Q1 2023-2025, which IMB has so far omitted from public press releases.

c. Confirmation of the Q4 2022 stand-alone figure (the annual total 41 is known; it implies only four incidents occurred in Q4 if the Q1 figure was 37 and the Q1–Q3 cumulative remained flat, but the IMB report has not been sighted to verify).

5.  Implications for the Q1 2026 forecast

• The verified three-year uptrend in Q1 incident counts (+22 % CAGR from 2023-2025) suggests momentum that forecasters must weigh against any deterrence initiatives scheduled for 2025-2026 (e.g., expanded naval deployments in the Gulf of Guinea).

• Because the incident base is now heavily concentrated in two geographically distinct phenomena—low-level opportunistic boarding in the Singapore Straits and higher-risk kidnap/armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea—scenario modelling for 2026 should segment those drivers separately.

• Filling the noted data gaps, particularly the missing quarters of 2020-2022, would allow better seasonality adjustment and estimation of how frequently Q1 is above or below the other quarters, a factor that can materially affect projection accuracy.

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
