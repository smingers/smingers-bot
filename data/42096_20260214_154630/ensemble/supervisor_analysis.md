Disagreement Analysis:

**Disagreement 1: Resolution window — full Q1 vs. partial Q1 (post-Feb 14 only)**
Forecaster 3 interprets the fine print ("Events before this date do not count toward resolution") as meaning only incidents from Feb 14–Mar 31 count, effectively halving the quarter. This leads to a median around 18-19 incidents. All other forecasters (1, 2, 4, 5) treat the question as covering the full calendar Q1 (Jan 1–Mar 31), with medians in the 33-41 range. This is by far the largest source of disagreement, accounting for roughly a 15-20 incident gap between forecaster 3 and the others.

**Disagreement 2: Magnitude of Singapore Straits enforcement effect on Q1 2026**
Among the four forecasters using full-Q1, there's meaningful disagreement about how much the mid-2025 Indonesian gang arrests will suppress Q1 2026 numbers. Forecaster 1 is most aggressive on suppression (median ~35, with reasoning citing 87% of Singapore Straits incidents occurred before August and an "13% of prior rate" post-enforcement). Forecaster 5 is least aggressive (median ~38), while forecaster 2 sits at ~40. The spread here is about 5 incidents at the median, driven by different assessments of how durable the enforcement effect is and whether criminal networks reconstitute.

**Disagreement 3: Right tail risk (reconstitution/new hotspots)**
Forecasters differ on the upper tail. Forecaster 5 puts P90 at 57, forecaster 2 at 56, while forecaster 1 puts P90 at only 48. This reflects different views on the probability of a rapid resurgence in Singapore Straits or escalation in Gulf of Guinea/Somalia.

Root Causes:

1. **Resolution window**: This is a **different interpretation of the resolution criteria**. The fine print note about the Forecast Opening Date is ambiguous — it could mean the question simply opened for forecasting on that date (standard Metaculus practice) or that only incidents after that date count. This is the most impactful disagreement.

2. **Singapore Straits enforcement durability**: This is **different weighting of the same evidence** combined with **different factual beliefs** about current patrol levels and early 2026 incident rates. All forecasters cite the same July 2025 arrests but draw different conclusions about persistence into Q1 2026.

3. **Right tail risk**: This is primarily **different subjective weighting** of reconstitution scenarios — not easily resolvable by facts.

4. How does the Metaculus fine print statement "Events before this date do not count toward resolution" typically apply? Specifically, for a question asking about Q1 2026 piracy incidents that opened on Feb 14, 2026, does this mean only incidents after Feb 14 count, or does it refer to the full calendar Q1? Also, are there any IMB or ReCAAP reports showing piracy incident counts for January-February 2026 in the Singapore Straits or globally? (Agent)
