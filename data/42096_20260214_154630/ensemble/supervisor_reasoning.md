Resolution of Disagreements:

**Disagreement 1 (Resolution window — full Q1 vs. partial Q1): RESOLVED.** The targeted research clearly establishes that the Metaculus fine print "Events before this date do not count toward resolution" is an automatically inserted template disclaimer that does NOT override the explicit resolution criteria. The resolution criteria state: "the number of maritime piracy and armed robbery incidents that take place during Q1 2026, according to the IMB in its Q1 2026 quarterly report." Precedent on Metaculus confirms that quarterly questions opened after the start of the period resolve on the full period. Therefore, forecaster 3's interpretation (only counting incidents from Feb 14 onward) is incorrect. The full calendar Q1 (Jan 1–Mar 31, 2026) applies. This eliminates forecaster 3's predictions from consideration.

**Disagreement 2 (Singapore Straits enforcement effect magnitude): PARTIALLY RESOLVED.** The research confirms that ReCAAP recorded 4 incidents in the Singapore Strait between Jan 1-27, 2026. This is a dramatically lower rate than early 2025 (which saw ~80 incidents in H1 alone, or roughly 13+ per month). The 4 incidents in ~27 days suggests enforcement effects are persisting but activity hasn't ceased entirely. This supports the forecasters who predicted meaningful suppression (forecasters 1 and 4) over those who were less aggressive on the enforcement effect (forecaster 5). However, the Singapore Strait data alone doesn't give us the full global picture.

**Disagreement 3 (Right tail risk): NOT RESOLVED.** No clear evidence either way on reconstitution speed.

Updated Analysis:

With forecaster 3 eliminated, I'm working with forecasters 1, 2, 4, and 5, whose medians range from ~35 to ~41. The key evidence points:

1. **Historical Q1 base rates**: 27 (2023), 33 (2024), 45 (2025). The upward trend is clear but the Singapore Straits enforcement is a structural break.

2. **Singapore Straits Jan 2026**: ~4 incidents in 27 days ≈ ~4.4/month. In H1 2025, SOMS saw ~13/month. So SOMS is running at roughly 1/3 of its H1 2025 rate. Over a full quarter, this would yield ~13 SOMS incidents vs. the ~40 that would have been expected at H1 2025 rates. That's a reduction of ~27 incidents from the SOMS component alone.

3. **Q1 2025 breakdown**: 45 total. If SOMS was proportionally ~58% of the annual total, Q1 2025 SOMS might have been ~26 incidents, with ~19 from other regions. If SOMS drops to ~13 and other regions stay stable or slightly increase (Gulf of Guinea uptick noted), we'd expect roughly 13 + 20 = ~33 incidents.

4. **But Q1 2024 was 33 with much lower SOMS activity**, suggesting non-SOMS baseline may be somewhat variable.

This analysis supports a median around 33-36, which aligns most closely with forecasters 1 and 4. Forecasters 2 and 5 seem slightly high given the confirmed low January SOMS rate.

I'll adjust the weighted average downward slightly, centering the median around 35 with appropriate uncertainty. The right tail should remain meaningful given reconstitution risk.
