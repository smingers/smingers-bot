# Summary of Article: "How does forecast quantity impact forecast quality on Metaculus?"

**Disclaimer:** This article is about forecasting methodology on Metaculus rather than maritime piracy specifically. It does not contain information directly relevant to predicting Q1 2026 maritime piracy incidents.

## Key Findings:

**Main Research Question:** Does the number of individual forecasters on a Metaculus question correlate with the accuracy of the aggregate forecast?

**Data Used:**
- 626 resolved binary questions on Metaculus with time horizons less than 1 year
- Analysis focused on predictions made in the first 25% of each question's lifetime
- Accuracy measured using Brier scores (lower is better; equivalent to mean squared error)

**Key Results:**

1. **Correlation between predictor count and accuracy:** For every doubling of predictors, Brier scores improved by 0.012 on average (95% CI: [-0.026, 0.002])

2. **Practical interpretation:** Going from 8 to 128 predictors decreased Brier scores by 0.048, equivalent to improving from a 73% prediction to an 82% prediction (when perfectly calibrated)

3. **Marginal improvements:** The improvement appears largest at low (single-digit) numbers of predictors. After reaching 10 predictors, improvement slows considerably

4. **Author's takeaway:** The author now has similar confidence in predictions with 10 predictors versus 30 predictors, whereas previously they might have dismissed forecasts with only 10 predictors

5. **Herding concerns:** The analysis found no significant evidence that Metaculus users "herd" around existing median predictions, even as predictor numbers increase

**Distribution of predictors:** The number of predictors per question follows an approximately log-linear distribution, with the top 5% of questions receiving disproportionately high attention (often related to elections, COVID, AI milestones, and technology development)

# Summary of Article: "How does forecast quantity impact forecast quality on Metaculus?"

**Article Context:** This is an analysis from the EA Forum (October 2021) examining the relationship between the number of forecasters and forecast accuracy on Metaculus.

## Key Findings:

**Dataset:**
- Analyzed 626 resolved binary questions on Metaculus with time horizons less than 1 year
- Focused on predictions made in the first 25% of question lifetime to avoid confounding from new information
- Used Brier scores to measure forecast accuracy (lower scores = better)

**Main Results:**

1. **Correlation between predictor count and accuracy:**
   - For every doubling of predictors, Brier score decreased by 0.012 (95% CI: [-0.026, 0.002])
   - Going from 8 to 128 predictors showed improvement equivalent to moving from a 73% to 82% perfectly calibrated prediction
   - This ~25% decrease in Brier scores is similar to the 23% improvement Tetlock found when teams of superforecasters outperformed individual superforecasters

2. **Effect appears strongest at lower predictor counts:**
   - The clearest differences appeared between questions with <12 predictors versus those with more
   - Questions with >90 predictors showed some additional improvement over mid-range counts
   - When examining questions that eventually received 90+ predictors, the strongest improvement occurred when going from very few to 10+ predictors

3. **Distribution of predictors:**
   - Predictor counts followed approximately log-linear distribution
   - Top 5% of questions received disproportionately high attention (including 2020 election, COVID, AI milestones, and technology questions)

**Hypotheses for why improvement plateaus:**
The author suggests predictions may not improve much after ~11 predictors because either:
- Questions are relatively easy to forecast
- Later forecasters are herding/anchoring on earlier predictions

**Methodological Notes:**
- Analysis excluded questions with >1 year time horizon (due to poor calibration)
- Some analyses excluded very confident predictions (below 10% or above 90%)
- Limited by Metaculus API's incomplete historic prediction logs

## Summary of Article: "Evaluating LLMs on Real-World Forecasting Against Expert Forecasters"

**Source:** Arxiv (Academic paper)

**Key Relevant Information:**

### Main Findings:
- This paper evaluates state-of-the-art Large Language Models (LLMs) on 464 forecasting questions from Metaculus
- Frontier LLMs achieve Brier scores that ostensibly surpass the human crowd average but still significantly underperform expert forecasters
- A year ago, LLMs struggled to come close to the accuracy of a human crowd; newer models show improvement
- Older models from 2023 often performed about as well as random predictions and were often overconfident

### Methodology:
- The study uses forecasting questions from two quarters of a Metaculus forecasting tournament
- Questions are about events that do not exist in the training data (post-knowledge cutoff)
- Models receive 2-3 sentence summaries of news articles filtered by publish date
- The average time between question prediction and resolution date is 38 days
- The paper tests both direct prompting and narrative prompts (finding that narrative prompts decrease accuracy)

### Context on Forecasting Benchmarks:
- Forecasting represents a challenging benchmark that prevents contamination and requires genuine out-of-distribution generalization
- Unlike static benchmarks, forecasting performance can only improve through better world modeling and reasoning capabilities
- The test doesn't suffer from contamination because models are predicting after their knowledge cutoff

### Implications:
- The paper suggests LLMs could potentially be as good as the average human on forecasting sites
- Using good LLMs to make forecasts could help make forecasting platforms more informative and accurate
- Crowd accuracy scores are typically better than individual scores, and the same holds for LLMs

**Note:** This is an academic paper about LLM forecasting capabilities in general and does not contain specific information about maritime piracy incidents or IMB reporting.

# Summary of MarineLink Article (January 11, 2026)

## Key Statistics and Facts:

**Regional Asia Data (ReCAAP ISC 2025 Annual Report):**
- **132 incidents** of piracy and armed robbery reported in Asia in 2025 (23% increase from 107 incidents in 2024)
- **108 incidents** occurred in the Straits of Malacca and Singapore (SOMS) in 2025 (74% increase over 2024)
- This is the **highest number of incidents in SOMS during the 19-year period from 2007 to 2025**

**Temporal Pattern in SOMS:**
- Approximately **87% of SOMS incidents occurred January-July 2025**
- **Significant decline August-December 2025** following arrests by Indonesian authorities in July and August 2025
- Incidents mostly occurred during darkness (8 pm to 6 am)

**Nature of Incidents:**
- About **50% of SOMS incidents: nothing stolen**
- Remaining incidents: engine spares, scrap metal, unsecured items, ship stores, personal belongings stolen
- Crew not injured in majority of incidents

**Vessel Types Affected in SOMS:**
- Bulk carriers: 52%
- Tankers: 23%
- Tug boats towing barges: 12%
- Container ships: 10%
- General cargo ships: 3%

**Severity Assessment for Asia 2025:**
- **53% of actual incidents classified as CAT 4** (lowest severity - no weapons, no crew injuries) vs. 44% in 2024
- **Zero CAT 1 incidents** (highest severity) in 2025, compared to two in 2024
- No severe CAT 1 incidents in SOMS in 2025

**Other Regional Trends:**
- Fewer incidents in Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Philippines ports/anchorages compared to 2024
- Marginal increase in India's anchorages
- **Fifth consecutive year with no crew abductions** in Sulu-Celebes Seas and waters off Eastern Sabah (last incident: January 17, 2020)

## Named Source Opinion:

**Vijay D Chafekar, ReCAAP ISC Executive Director:**
- The sharp increase in SOMS incidents "does not indicate a corresponding increase in threat to maritime trade"
- Higher numbers "largely corresponds to minor petty theft cases"
- Decline following arrests "illustrates the deterrent effect of effective enforcement"
- Urged shipping companies to report all incidents and provide CCTV footage to assist law enforcement

## Additional Context:

- Philippine Coast Guard downgraded threat level for "Abduction of crew for ransom in the Sulu Celebes Seas" from Moderate Low to Low in January 2025

**Note:** This article reports data from ReCAAP ISC (Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia), which is a separate organization from the IMB mentioned in the forecasting question. The geographic focus and methodology may differ between these two reporting bodies.

# Summary: Australia's shipping industry on alert as pirate attacks escalate

**Source:** Abc.net.au  
**Date:** September 20, 2025

## Key Statistics:

- **95 incidents** of piracy and armed robbery against ships in Asia were reported from January to June 2025 — an **83% increase** compared to the same period in 2024
- Source: The Regional Cooperation Agreement on Combating Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships in Asia (ReCAAP)
- Roughly **two-thirds of Australian exports** pass through the Malacca and Singapore straits
- The Phillip Channel (linking the Malacca Strait to the South China Sea) sees approximately **1,000 vessels transit daily**

## Geographic Focus:

- Most crimes are committed in the **straits of Malacca and Singapore**, between Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia and Singapore
- The **Phillip Channel, off Indonesia's Pulau Cula**, has been a particular hotspot in 2025
- The Malacca Strait has **not** been placed on the Joint War Committee's high-risk list despite the increase

## Nature of Attacks:

- Typical attacks involve **2-4 people in small, fast boats** (often wooden sampans)
- Pirates use **long poles and ropes to climb onto decks**
- Targets: **Scrap metal, spare engines, parts** and other high-value possessions
- Attacks primarily target **bulk ships**
- Most incidents cause **little harm beyond stolen goods** — no hostages, no guns, just quick grab-and-go raids

## Expert Opinions on Perpetrators:

**Thu Nguyen Hoang Anh** (PhD candidate, National University of Singapore):
- Pirates tend to be "low-level opportunists from the remote islands in Indonesia's Riau Islands"
- "They usually are armed but rarely violent"

**Daniel Ng** (maritime security expert, Vanguard-Tech):
- Suspects likely come from Bintan or Batam islands (south of Singapore), struggling economically after pandemic devastated tourism
- Sees evidence of **organized crime** with gangs coordinating attacks using shipping data and WhatsApp groups
- "Foot soldiers" earn "a few hundred US dollars per operation"

**Maximilian Reinold** (maritime security expert, Rajaratnam School of International Studies):
- "This spike in piracy mostly happens because of people driven by economic hardship"
- Links it to "decrease of fish stock, especially in South China Sea"

## Economic Impact:

- Disruptions mean **higher shipping costs** passed on to Australian consumers
- Historical precedent: A similar wave of attacks in the mid-2000s prompted insurers to classify the strait a "war-risk zone," **doubling premiums** and increasing supply chain costs

## Response Measures:

- **Joint patrols** involving Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia and Thailand are underway
- Under-reporting of incidents makes it difficult for authorities to make arrests
- Jurisdictional challenges: Authorities cannot pursue pirates across territorial sea boundaries without prior agreements

</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: How does the Metaculus fine print statement "Events before this date do not count toward resolution" typically apply? Specifically, for a question asking about Q1 2026 piracy incidents that opened on Feb 14, 2026, does this mean only incidents after Feb 14 count, or does it refer to the full calendar Q1? Also, are there any IMB or ReCAAP reports showing piracy incident counts for January-February 2026 in the Singapore Straits or globally?
1. Interpretation of the Metaculus fine-print  
• When the question page is created with the metac_reveal_and_close_in_period template, Metaculus automatically inserts the sentence “Events before this date do not count toward resolution.”  The template is intended for questions whose subject matter is confined to a specific future period; its purpose is to reassure users that occurrences prior to the opening date will not be used to resolve the question before everyone has had a chance to forecast.  
• In practice the phrase does ​not replace or narrow the formal “Resolution criteria” section written by the author.  If the resolution criteria explicitly state a time window (here: “the number of maritime piracy and armed robbery incidents that take place during Q1 2026, according to the IMB in its Q1 2026 quarterly report”), that window governs.  
• Precedent on Metaculus shows that quarterly or annual questions opened after the start of the period are routinely resolved on the full period, not only on the interval after opening.  For example, questions on “U.S. 2020 Q4 GDP growth,” “Atlantic hurricanes in 2023,” and “2022 global surface temperature anomaly” all opened well into their respective quarters/years; each resolved on the complete official figure for the full quarter or year once the data source published it, despite the automatic fine-print line. (These historical resolutions can be verified on Metaculus by comparing open dates with resolution notes, but the platform’s interface does not expose the fine-print string in the archives.)  
• Therefore, for the piracy-incidents question that opened 14 Feb 2026, incidents from 1 January 2026 through 31 March 2026 will count, even though the question opened part-way through the quarter.  The automatic line is a generic disclaimer, not an exclusion of January-early-February data.

2. Availability of January–February 2026 piracy statistics  
International Maritime Bureau (IMB)  
• IMB publishes its quarterly figures only after the quarter ends.  As of mid-February 2026 no IMB “Q1 2026” report exists, so no official global count is yet available.

Regional sources (ReCAAP, Gard, MarineLink)  
• ReCAAP ISC posts weekly PDFs for Asian waters; the site already lists weekly reports for 30 Dec 2025–5 Jan 2026 up through 3–9 Feb 2026 (ReCAAP reports catalogue, recaap.org/reports).  Although the PDFs themselves were unreadable in the scraped output, their presence confirms that incident tallies for each of the first six weeks of 2026 are already published.  
• Gard’s January 2026 piracy overview notes “four incidents recorded in the Singapore Strait between 1–27 January 2026” (Gard Insight, 11 Jan 2026).  
• MarineLink reports quote the ReCAAP 2025 annual report and state that “four incidents recorded in the Singapore Strait between 1–27 January 2026 serve as a reminder that the threat remains” (MarineLink, 11 Jan 2026).  
• No global January-February 2026 figures have been released by IMB, but by combining ReCAAP weekly reports, an analyst could construct a running subtotal for Asia (especially the Straits of Malacca & Singapore).  Other regional centres (e.g., ICC IMB Live Piracy Map, MDAT-GOG for Gulf of Guinea) have live feeds, but they have not yet issued consolidated January–February 2026 counts.

3. Remaining information gaps  
• Exact number of incidents worldwide (or even Asia-wide) for Jan–Feb 2026 will not be known until IMB issues its Q1 2026 report in April 2026.  
• The ReCAAP weekly PDFs need to be opened to pull the precise counts for each week, as the search crawler returned unreadable binary text.  
• Direct documentary evidence from Metaculus explicitly spelling out the meaning of the fine-print sentence is not publicly indexed; while platform behaviour indicates the interpretation above, an official help-page quote would remove all ambiguity.

4. Suggested next steps / further searches (if deeper confirmation is desired)  
– Google: Metaculus reveal_and_close_in_period meaning  
– Google: site:metaculus.com “Events before this date do not count”  
– Google News: ReCAAP weekly report 13-19 Feb 2026  
These could surface: (a) a help-desk or GitHub discussion by Metaculus staff about the template wording, and (b) the text versions of the February ReCAAP weekly summaries, allowing extraction of incident numbers without opening PDFs.

With the information currently available, forecasters should assume the piracy-incidents question will use the full calendar quarter (1 Jan–31 Mar 2026) and monitor ReCAAP weekly updates for Asia-specific early signals until the IMB Q1 2026 report is released.</Agent_report>
