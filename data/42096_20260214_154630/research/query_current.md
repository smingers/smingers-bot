Analysis:
To refine a Q1 2026 forecast I need the freshest counts and qualitative signals on:
• Incident tallies since the IMB’s 2025 annual cut-off (i.e., January–mid-February 2026).  
• Regional spikes or lulls (Gulf of Guinea, Singapore Strait, Indonesia, Latin America).  
• New risk-mitigation measures or naval deployments that could change the trajectory.  
• Any IMB, ReCAAP, or insurance-sector advisories hinting at preliminary 2026 numbers.  
Queries therefore target (a) the latest IMB statements, (b) press or specialist coverage of individual January–February 2026 attacks, and (c) aggregated regional briefs.
