Analysis:
The key to baselining Q1-2026 is to retrieve (a) the exact incident counts published by the IMB for Q1 in 2025, 2024, 2023 and earlier, and (b) any commentary on regional drivers—especially Gulf of Guinea, Singapore Strait, and Latin America—as these regions largely determine quarter-to-quarter volatility.  IMB’s quarterly reports (usually titled “Piracy and Armed Robbery Report – First Quarter YYYY”) and ICC‐CCS press releases are the primary sources.  Supplementary sources are trade journals (e.g., Lloyd’s List, TradeWinds) that often quote preliminary numbers before the official PDF is released.  Therefore, searches should target those PDFs and related news coverage.
