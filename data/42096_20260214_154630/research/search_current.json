The majority of these crimes\u201469%\u2014involved no weapons, while 31% (152 cases) included weapons such as firearms, blunt instruments, crowbars, master keys, or knives. The most affected communes in 2025 were Oriental and Cabecera del Llano, but over the past five years, the Centro comuna has led in incidents, followed by Oriental and La Concordia. In 2025, five neighborhoods\u2014Centro, La Concordia, El Tejar, Cabecera, and San Francisco\u2014each recorded more than 20 thefts. The crimes are widespread, occurring across all 17 communes and eight corregimientos. According to Dr. Richard Larrota, a criminal behavior expert, these crimes are typically committed by organized groups with defined roles, including surveillance, logistics, and weapon procurement. He notes that repeat patterns (modus operandi) are common and that understanding them can aid prevention. Regarding violent incidents, such as the fatal robbery in Monterredondo that resulted in the owner\u2019s death, Larrota attributes heightened aggression to potential drug use, which heightens risk-taking and reduces fear. He emphasizes the need for stronger community-police collaboration, advocating for citizen-led security fronts to detect suspicious behavior and prevent crime.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 09:58 PM\nSource:[www.vanguardia.com](https://www.vanguardia.com/area-metropolitana/bucaramanga/2026/02/13/estos-son-los-barrios-de-bucaramanga-con-mas-hurtos-a-establecimientos/)\n\n**Offensive in El Fasher, Sudan, Investigated as War Crime**\nThe UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) released a report on February 13, 2026, detailing grave violations during the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) offensive to capture El Fasher, Sudan, in October 2025. The report, based on over 140 interviews with victims and witnesses in northern Sudan and eastern Chad, describes an 'intense wave of violence' in the first three days of the assault, following an 18-month siege. More than 6,000 people were killed during the initial days, with at least 4,400 deaths occurring within El Fasher and over 1,600 along evacuation routes. A particularly documented incident on October 26 involved RSF forces opening heavy fire on approximately 1,000 civilians sheltering in the Al-Rashid dormitory at El Fasher University, resulting in around 500 deaths. Witnesses reported scenes resembling 'a horror movie,' with bodies being thrown into the air. The report alleges that RSF and allied Arab militias committed widespread abuses, including mass killings, summary executions, sexual violence, abductions for ransom, torture, arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, looting, and the use of child soldiers. Many attacks targeted civilians and non-combatants based on ethnicity or alleged links to the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF). The report identifies 10 detention centers used by the RSF in El Fasher, including the converted Children's Hospital, where conditions were described as extremely inadequate, leading to disease outbreaks and deaths in custody. Thousands remain missing. UN High Commissioner Volker Turk stated that the violence demonstrates ongoing impunity fueling cycles of conflict and called for credible, impartial investigations to hold commanders and superiors accountable. He urged action through Sudanese independent courts, universal jurisdiction in third countries, the International Criminal Court, or other mechanisms. The report concludes there are 'reasonable grounds' to believe the RSF committed war crimes, including murder, attacks on civilians, using starvation as a weapon, attacks on medical and humanitarian personnel, sexual violence, torture, looting, and child recruitment. Turk also urged states with influence over the warring parties to act urgently to prevent recurrence, emphasizing adherence to the existing arms embargo and halting the supply of weapons or military material to conflict groups.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 03:55 PM\nSource:[UN News](https://news.un.org/pt/story/2026/02/1852381)\n\n**3 European Destinations with Highest Theft Rates in 2026**\nAccording to a report by Atmos, a trade company, Britain ranks as the most dangerous European destination for tourists in 2026, with 254,000 annual theft cases\u2014equivalent to a burglary every two minutes\u2014and 364,000 vehicle thefts per year.

Jos\u00e9 Alfredo Vega Herrera, the organization's president, reported at least 15 theft incidents per month during that period, with stolen items escalating from small tools to machinery and building materials. These crimes, often committed by armed, organized gangs during daylight hours, are described as highly coordinated and non-violent, with no shots fired and sufficient time to complete the theft before police arrive. The stolen materials\u2014primarily cement, wire, and rebar\u2014are easily resold within the state. The group bears the financial burden of these losses, which they estimate reduce project profitability by 20%, despite having insurance for machinery and vehicles but not for construction materials. They also express concern over worker safety, as employees are being robbed of their wages during commutes. While private security is being hired, it is insufficient against armed perpetrators. The organization urges authorities to provide more immediate and effective security support to prevent further increases in thefts during the first quarter of 2026.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 12:14 AM\nSource:[El Economista](https://www.eleconomista.com.mx/estados/constructores-puebla-llaman-fortalecer-seguridad-zonas-obras-20260212-799660.html)\n\n**Investigative Committee Reports on 2025 Achievements, Highlights Record Low Crime Rates in Belarus**\nThe Investigative Committee of Belarus held a collegium meeting at its central office, chaired by head Konstantin Bychek, to review the results of its work for 2025.

The attack took place in the captain's cabin, resulting in the captain's death, after which Lin dismembered the body and disposed of the remains at sea. The Weihai Maritime Police Bureau of China established a special task force on March 12, 2025, and arrested Lin, who had attempted to obstruct rescue efforts, piloted the vessel alone, and coerced the chief engineer to return to port before being subdued by other crew members. On September 2025, Chu's daughter, Xiao Xing (a pseudonym), received official documents from the Weihai Maritime Police Bureau confirming her father's death with no possibility of survival, a psychiatric evaluation ruling out insanity, a confession from the suspect, and identification of the murder weapon. The case was subsequently transferred to the procuratorate. On January 7, 2026, Xiao Xing announced that the first-instance verdict had been delivered, sentencing Lin Mou to death. Lin had previously worked under Chu for several years, but after Chu ceased fishing operations for three to four years, Lin worked elsewhere. Lin's father and Chu's maternal uncle were from the same village and former comrades-in-arms, but the two families had no close relationship; Chu and Lin were only colleagues. Lin rejoined Chu's vessel in August 2024, and the murder occurred on March 11, 2025, in international waters. According to the Weihai Maritime Police Bureau, in 2025, Chinese maritime police seized over 1,900 public security cases, conducted over 2,200 rescue operations, and rescued more than 1,700 people in distress.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 04:56 PM\nSource:[finance.sina.com.cn](https://finance.sina.cn/2026-02-12/detail-inhmqffy2839338.d.html)\n\n**Global Maritime Piracy & Armed Robbery Surge In 2025, Highest In Singapore Straits**\nThe ICC International Maritime Bureau (IMB) reported a rise in global maritime piracy and armed robbery incidents in 2025, with 137 incidents recorded\u2014up from 116 in 2024 and 120 in 2023. Of these, 121 vessels were boarded, four hijacked, two fired upon, and 10 attempted attacks. While most incidents were classified as low-level, violence against crew persisted: 46 crew members were taken hostage in 2025 (down from 126 in 2024 and 73 in 2023), 25 were kidnapped (up from 12 in 2024 and 14 in 2023), 10 threatened, four injured, and three assaulted. The use of firearms increased, with 42 incidents involving guns in 2025 (up from 26 in 2024), while knives were reported in 33 incidents (down from 39 in 2024). The Singapore Straits recorded the highest number of incidents globally in 2025\u201480, more than half (58%) of the global total\u2014up from 43 in 2024. Notably, gun use in the region rose sharply, with 27 incidents in 2025 compared to eight in 2024. Fourteen crew were taken hostage, eight threatened, three injured, and one assaulted. However, a significant decline in incidents occurred in the second half of 2025 after the Indonesian Marine Police apprehended two gangs in July. Incidents in the Indonesian archipelago dropped from 18 in 2023 and 22 in 2024 to 12 in 2025, with two crew taken hostage and one threatened. The IMB emphasized the importance of timely incident reporting, stating that prompt reporting enables preventive action and enhances safety for other vessels. ICC Secretary General John W.H. Denton AO stressed the need for sustained international cooperation to secure global supply chains. Naval presence has contained Somali piracy, with only two incidents reported in 2025, both far from shore. The Gulf of Guinea saw 21 incidents in 2025 (down from 22 in 2024), with 23 crew kidnapped, three taken hostage, and one injured.

Of the 137 attacks, 121 ships were boarded, four were hijacked, two were shot at, and ten faced attempted boardings. The IMB, which operates under the International Chamber of Commerce, emphasized the importance of protecting seafarers and securing major maritime routes, citing risks not only to crew safety but also to global supply chains and dependent economies. The report underscores the growing urgency for enhanced maritime security measures.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 16, 2026 01:17 PM\nSource:[Le marin](https://lemarin.ouest-france.fr/shipping/piraterie-le-bureau-maritime-international-pointe-un-regain-des-attaques-avec-un-pic-dans-le-detroit-de-singapour-27c12234-f22c-11f0-977d-9ddad21d78c7)\n\n**Piracy attacks on vessels surge to 137 in 2025 despite security gains**\nThe ICC International Maritime Bureau (IMB) reported a 18.1% increase in global maritime incidents involving piracy and armed robbery in 2025, with 137 incidents recorded\u2014up from 116 in 2024, 120 in 2023, 115 in 2022, and 132 in 2021. Of these, 121 vessels were boarded, four hijacked, two fired upon, and 10 attacks were attempted. Violence against crew continued, with 46 crew members taken hostage in 2025 (compared to 126 in 2024 and 73 in 2023), 25 reported kidnapped (up from 12 in 2024 and 14 in 2023), 10 threatened, four injured, and three assaulted. The use of guns rose to 42 incidents in 2025 (from 26 in 2024), while knife use was reported in 33 incidents (down from 39 in 2024). Regionally, the Singapore Straits recorded the highest number of incidents (80, up from 43 in 2024), accounting for 58% of global cases, with 27 gun-related incidents and 14 crew taken hostage. A significant decline occurred in the second half of 2025 after the Indonesian Marine Police apprehended two gangs in July. The Gulf of Guinea saw 21 incidents (up from 18 in 2024), with 23 crew kidnapped in four incidents, three hostages, and one injured. The Indonesian archipelago saw a drop to 12 incidents (from 18 in 2023 and 22 in 2024), with two crew taken hostage and three knife incidents. Off the Somali coast, only two incidents were reported in November, attributed to sustained naval presence, vessel hardening, and best management practices. The IMB Piracy Reporting Centre (PRC) expressed concern over delayed reporting, emphasizing that timely alerts are critical for preventive action. IMB Director Michael Howlett stressed the need for sustained regional and international cooperation to protect seafarers and trade routes. ICC Secretary General John Denton highlighted that maritime trade is vital to global economic stability, and safeguarding shipping lanes requires coordinated efforts between authorities, navies, and industry.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 16, 2026 05:12 AM\nSource:[The Guardian](https://guardian.ng/business-services/piracy-attacks-on-vessels-surge-to-137-in-2025-despite-security-gains/)\n\n**Piracy Incidents Rise in 2025, Especially in Strait of Singapore, According to IMB-ICC Annual Report**\nThe International Maritime Bureau (IMB) of the International Chamber of Commerce (ICC) reported a rise in piracy and armed robbery incidents at sea in 2025, with 137 incidents recorded\u2014up from 116 in 2024 and 120 in 2023. A total of 121 vessels were boarded, four diverted, two targeted by gunfire, and ten subjected to attack attempts. In 2025, 25 mariners were kidnapped and 46 taken hostage\u2014significantly higher than 126 and 14 in 2024, respectively. The spike in hostage-taking in 2024 was linked to a resurgence of piracy in Somalia, where three ships were hijacked and 50 crew members taken hostage across eight incidents. In 2025, Somali piracy was contained to five incidents with 26 crew members taken hostage, down from 50 in 2024, indicating that naval presence has deterred major operations. However, two incidents occurred in November far from shore, showing continued high-sea capability. The IMB-ICC noted that well-prepared crews and rapid naval response ensured safety. Piracy in the Gulf of Guinea remained relatively stable with 21 incidents in 2025 (18 in 2024, 22 in 2023), well below the 81 recorded in 2020. Yet, 23 crew members were kidnapped and three taken hostage\u2014double the 2024 figures. The majority of global incidents\u201480\u2014occurred in the Strait of Singapore, up from 43 in 2024 and 23 in 2020, accounting for 58% of all incidents. These incidents were less severe but involved increasing use of firearms (27 cases in 2025 vs. 8 in 2024), with 14 crew members taken hostage and eight threatened. A positive development was the decline in incidents in the second half of the year following the Indonesian maritime police\u2019s July 2025 arrests of two organized pirate gangs.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 16, 2026 01:24 AM\nSource:[Mer et Marine](https://www.meretmarine.com/fr/marine-marchande/piraterie-les-incidents-en-hausse-en-2025-selon-le-rapport-annuel-de-l-imb-icc)\n\n**Maritime Piracy Incidents Rise 18% Worldwide in 2025, According to IMB Report**\nThe International Maritime Bureau (IMB), based in London, released its annual report on maritime piracy on January 15, 2026, revealing an 18% increase in piracy incidents worldwide in 2025 compared to 2024. The report documented a total of 137 incidents, the highest number recorded between 2021 and 2025. Of these, 121 vessels were boarded, four were hijacked, and two were targeted, in addition to ten attempted attacks. The Strait of Malacca remains the primary hotspot for piracy, while Somali piracy remains limited due to the continued presence of international military forces. The report indicates that maritime piracy continues to pose a growing global threat.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 01:06 PM\nSource:[Ouest France](https://www.ouest-france.fr/mer/les-actes-de-piraterie-maritime-en-hausse-de-18-pourcent-dans-le-monde-en-2025-b6b16aaa-f1f3-11f0-87e6-f801a63b73d7)\n\n**Nine crew kidnapped from LPG carrier off West Africa, maritime-security firms report**\nNine crew members were kidnapped from the LPG carrier CGAS Saturn, a 3,090-dwt Portuguese-flagged vessel, after armed attackers boarded the ship approximately 50 nautical miles west of Equatorial Guinea while en route to Malabo. According to Vanguard and Diaplous, who issued incident alerts on December 3, 2025, the attackers gathered the crew, stole personal belongings, and abducted nine individuals, leaving one crew member with light injuries. Christiana Gas, the operator, activated its emergency response team, and the injured seafarer received onboard treatment. A Portuguese Navy patrol vessel was deployed to assist, and the CGAS Saturn eventually reached safe waters with the remaining crew, including several senior officers. The identity of the attackers remains unknown. Maritime-risk firm Neptune P2P emphasized that the incident highlights the ongoing kidnap-for-ransom threat in the Gulf of Guinea, despite a significant decline in piracy since regional navies expanded joint patrols in 2021. The International Maritime Bureau (IMB) recorded 15 incidents and 14 kidnappings between January and September 2025, while Neptune P2P reported 17 incidents in the past year; differing definitions of piracy and armed robbery affect these figures. The Gulf of Guinea continues to account for a disproportionate share of global maritime kidnappings, with deep-water attacks frequently occurring between Nigeria, S\u00e3o Tom\u00e9, Equatorial Guinea, and Gabon, where patrol gaps persist despite the Yaound\u00e9 Architecture security framework. Christiana Gas operates a small LPG fleet along West Africa\u2019s coastal corridors, where limited offshore patrol coverage leaves vessels vulnerable to such attacks. Security consultants note that ships involved in kidnappings often divert to secure anchorages under naval supervision, as regional centers coordinate search-and-rescue operations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 03, 2025 08:06 PM\nSource:[Newsbase](https://newsbase.com/story/nine-crew-kidnapped-from-lpg-carrier-off-west-africa-maritime-security-firms-report-414918)\n\n**Sailor Found Dead; Family Fears Pirate Attack**\nDeirdre Sibly (67), a woman from Port Lincoln, Australia, and her French partner Pascal were found dead on their sailboat near the coast of South Africa, close to Madagascar. The boat sent out a distress signal on Thursday, and authorities discovered the two bodies on Friday. While formal identification has not yet been completed, Sibly\u2019s sister, Sue Good, is certain the victims are her sister and her partner, stating they were on a lifelong adventure together. The couple departed from R\u00e9union Island in June, sailing through the Mozambique Channel toward Durban, South Africa, with plans for Sibly to fly home afterward. The family fears the deaths may have resulted from a pirate attack, a concern amplified by a reported increase in maritime piracy and armed robbery incidents in the first nine months of 2025, according to the International Maritime Bureau (IMB). The IMB reported 116 incidents between January and September 2025, with most occurring in the Singapore Strait. Of these, 102 vessels were boarded, nine attempts failed, four were hijacked, and one involved gunfire. Most attacks occurred at night, resulting in 43 crew members taken hostage, 16 kidnapped, seven threatened, and three assaulted and injured. Australian authorities are collaborating with local and French officials on the investigation. The boat remains at sea, and a recovery operation is planned. The family hopes for answers and the repatriation of Sibly\u2019s body as soon as possible.\nOriginal language: no\nPublish date: November 30, 2025 01:00 PM\nSource:[dagbladet.no](https://www.dagbladet.no/nyheter/seilere-funnet-dode-frykter-piratangrep/83918660)\n\n**IMB Global Piracy Report: Singapore Strait Cases Hit Record High in First Three Quarters of 2025**\nAccording to the International Maritime Bureau (IMB), global pirate and armed robbery incidents rose in the first three quarters of 2025, with Singapore Strait reporting a record high of 73 incidents\u2014the highest since systematic records began in 1991. Overall, 116 incidents were reported from January to September, a 47% increase from 79 in the same period last year. Of these, 102 vessels were boarded, 9 were attempted boardings, 4 were hijacked, and 1 was attacked with weapons. The majority of incidents (89) occurred during navigation, 23 during anchoring, and 4 during berthing, indicating increasingly organized pirate operations across different phases of voyages. About 55% of incidents involved weapons, with 33% of suspects carrying firearms\u2014the highest since 2017\u2014resulting in 43 crew members kidnapped, 16 abducted, 7 threatened, and 3 injured. While overall piracy remains in a downward trend, violence against crew has increased. The Gulf of Guinea remains a high-risk zone with 15 incidents (up from 12), including 10 coastal armed robberies and 5 oceanic pirate attacks, resulting in 14 crew kidnappings. The most recent incident involved a tanker near Ghana\u2019s coast in late August, demonstrating long-range capability. In the Singapore Strait, most incidents were small-scale robberies targeting fuel, parts, or cash. After the Indonesian Coast Guard arrested two transnational criminal gangs in July, incident numbers dropped significantly\u2014highlighted by IMB as a success of regional law enforcement cooperation. In the Somali and Arabian Sea region, no attacks were reported in the third quarter, continuing a stable trend, though 26 fishermen were still kidnapped in the first half of the year. IMB urges all vessels to report suspicious activity immediately to the piracy reporting center to enable rapid international response. The organization emphasizes that global information sharing and cross-border collaboration are essential to combat maritime crime and maintain international shipping security.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 04:28 AM\nSource:[Yahoo News (Taiwan)](https://tw.news.yahoo.com/%E5%89%8D3%E5%AD%A3%E5%85%A8%E7%90%83%E6%B5%B7%E7%9B%9C%E8%A5%B2%E6%93%8A%E5%A0%B1%E5%91%8Aimb-%E6%96%B0%E5%8A%A0%E5%9D%A1%E6%B5%B7%E5%B3%BD%E6%A1%88%E4%BB%B6%E5%89%B5%E6%96%B0%E9%AB%98-122847607.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
