Local law enforcement reportedly either ignored reports or denied the existence of serious problems in their waters.\n\n3. **Funding Model**: The IMB PRC services are free and funded purely by donations. Donations are acknowledged on their website and in quarterly and annual piracy and armed robbery reports.\n\n**Note**: This article is primarily informational about the IMB PRC's structure and does not contain specific statistics, forecasts, or data about incident counts relevant to predicting Q1 2026 figures.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://assets.eu.ctfassets.net/jchk06tdml2i/4uEtFn3i2EL5LbTl2xuom3/ab1cd7ba5a7d05e65387953b30e09dd8/6J5WVLg4VAhJxUanyzrxzM_en-US.pdf\">\nI apologize, but I cannot provide a meaningful summary of this article.

Key observations for the 2018-2025 series\n\n\u2022 Data availability: 2023-2025 are fully covered quarter-by-quarter; 2020-2022 have verified Q1 totals but lack other quarters; 2018-2019 have only Q1.  Thus, long-run seasonality analysis remains constrained.\n\n\u2022 First-quarter trend: a trough at 27 incidents in 2023, then a clear rise to 33 in 2024 and 45 in 2025\u2014aligning with the recent rebound in the annual totals (120 \u2192 116 \u2192 137).\n\n\u2022 Regional patterns:  \n  \u2013 Gulf of Guinea dominates serious violence (crew kidnaps) whenever figures are disclosed, even when its share of overall incidents fluctuates (43 % of events in Q1 2021 but only 19 % in Q1 2022).  \n  \u2013 Singapore Straits incidents are numerous but classified by IMB as \u201cpetty theft/armed robbery\u201d; they nonetheless account for roughly one-third of global Q1 cases in 2022 and 2023.  \n  \u2013 Callao anchorage, Peru emerges from 2020 onward as a persistent hotspot in the Americas data slice.\n\n\u2022 Methodological consistency: No press material points to definitional changes over the 2018-2025 horizon; IMB continues to count only piracy and armed robbery incidents that fit UNCLOS Art. 101 and IMO Res. A.1025(26).  Notably, Houthi missile/boat attacks in the Red Sea are excluded.\n\n4.  Remaining information gaps\n\na. Authenticated Q2\u2013Q4 counts for 2018-2022 (and Q2 2023).  These figures exist in the subscription-only PDF \u201cIMB Piracy & Armed Robbery Report \u2013 Q x 20yy\u201d series but are not quoted in open-access media.  \n\nb. Any regional numeric breakdowns for Q1 2023-2025, which IMB has so far omitted from public press releases.\n\nc. Confirmation of the Q4 2022 stand-alone figure (the annual total 41 is known; it implies only four incidents occurred in Q4 if the Q1 figure was 37 and the Q1\u2013Q3 cumulative remained flat, but the IMB report has not been sighted to verify).\n\n5.  Implications for the Q1 2026 forecast\n\n\u2022 The verified three-year uptrend in Q1 incident counts (+22 % CAGR from 2023-2025) suggests momentum that forecasters must weigh against any deterrence initiatives scheduled for 2025-2026 (e.g., expanded naval deployments in the Gulf of Guinea).\n\n\u2022 Because the incident base is now heavily concentrated in two geographically distinct phenomena\u2014low-level opportunistic boarding in the Singapore Straits and higher-risk kidnap/armed robbery in the Gulf of Guinea\u2014scenario modelling for 2026 should segment those drivers separately.\n\n\u2022 Filling the noted data gaps, particularly the missing quarters of 2020-2022, would allow better seasonality adjustment and estimation of how frequently Q1 is above or below the other quarters, a factor that can materially affect projection accuracy.\n\nSources:  \n\u2013 \u201cWorld-Wide incidents of piracy and armed robbery against ships January-March 2018\u201d (MaritimeCyprus, 11 Apr 2018)  \n\u2013 \u201cMaritime piracy incidents down in Q1 2019 but kidnapping risk in Gulf of Guinea persists\u201d (ICC, 8 Apr 2019)  \n\u2013 \u201cForty-seven maritime piracy incidents worldwide in first three months of 2020\u201d (VesselFinder, 14 Apr 2020)  \n\u2013 \u201cQ1 2021: Gulf of Guinea concerns remain despite decade-low overall piracy incidents\u201d (Sailworldcruising, 14 Apr 2021)  \n\u2013 \u201cIMB Q1 2022 Piracy and Armed Robbery Report \u2013 no crew kidnapping reported for Q1 since 2010\u201d (NorthStandard, 2022)  \n\u2013 IMB Q1-Q4 2023, 2024 and 2025 cumulative totals reproduced in question prompt.</Agent_report>\n"
