Local law enforcement reportedly either ignored reports or denied the existence of serious problems in their waters.\n\n3. **Funding Model**: The IMB PRC services are free and funded purely by donations. Donations are acknowledged on their website and in quarterly and annual piracy and armed robbery reports.\n\n**Note**: This article is primarily informational about the IMB PRC's structure and does not contain specific statistics, forecasts, or data about incident counts relevant to predicting Q1 2026 figures.\n</QuestionSource>\n"
