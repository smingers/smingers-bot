## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**

1. **July 2025 Indonesian Marine Police arrests**: Multiple independent sources (ICC official report, Marine Insight, The Guardian, Mer et Marine, Yahoo Taiwan) confirm that arresting two gangs in Singapore Straits led to "significant decline" in H2 2025. This is a **structural enforcement change** with demonstrated impact. The Singapore Straits went from 73 incidents in Q1-Q3 2025 to only 7 additional incidents in Q4 (80 total for year), suggesting ~40-50% reduction in incident rate post-arrests.

2. **Q1 2025 baseline of 45 incidents**: Confirmed by multiple sources and matches official table data. This represents a 35% increase from Q1 2024's 33 incidents.

3. **Singapore Straits dominance**: 80 of 137 incidents (58%) in 2025 occurred in Singapore Straits. The enforcement action directly targets the highest-volume region.

**Moderate Evidence:**

1. **Gulf of Guinea stability**: Multiple sources confirm 21 incidents in 2025 (vs 18 in 2024, 22 in 2023). Recent Q1 patterns show 5-7 incidents typically. The Dec 3, 2025 kidnapping incident suggests ongoing but contained activity.

2. **Somalia containment**: Naval presence maintains deterrent. Only 2 incidents in November 2025, both far from shore. Historically minimal Q1 activity in recent years.

3. **Reporting lag concerns**: IMB Director Howlett explicitly mentions "late reporting" issues in official 2025 report. This could mean Q1 2026 numbers might be revised upward later, but also suggests some incidents may never be reported.

**Weak Evidence:**

1. **Black Sea conflict incidents**: While creating maritime insecurity, these military actions don't count under IMB definitions. No direct impact on IMB-counted piracy.

2. **Individual incident reports**: The Madagascar/South Africa deaths and other anecdotal reports don't provide systematic trend information.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: Q1 2026 = January 1 - March 31, 2026 (90 days total)
- Current date: February 14, 2026 (45 days into quarter, 50% complete)
- Resolution: April 26, 2026 (when IMB Q1 2026 report expected)
- **Remaining exposure period**: 45 days (February 15 - March 31)

**Critical timing consideration**: We are forecasting the FULL Q1 2026 (Jan-Mar), but January 2026 has already occurred (44 days of incidents already happened but not yet reported). This significantly reduces uncertainty.

**If timeframe halved (45 days instead of 90)**:
- Would expect ~50% of quarterly total
- Historical Q1 2025: 45 incidents over 90 days = 0.5 incidents/day
- 45 days × 0.5 = ~22-23 incidents
- But enforcement effects may have changed the rate

**If timeframe doubled (180 days = 2 quarters)**:
- Would need to account for seasonal variation between Q1 and Q2
- Historical Q1+Q2 2025: 45 + 45 = 90 incidents (from cumulative table: Q2 showed 90 total, so Q2 alone = 45)
- Enforcement effects might compound or criminal networks might adapt

**Key insight**: Since we're 50% through the quarter, roughly half the incidents have already occurred. If enforcement effects from July 2025 persist, January-February 2026 should show lower rates than January-February 2025.

## (d) Justification for Adjusting Outside View

**Outside view baseline**: Q1 median of 38, recent Q1 mean (2022-2025) of 35.5, with Q1 2025 at 45.

**Factors warranting DOWNWARD adjustment from Q1 2025's 45**:

1. **Structural enforcement change** (Strong evidence): The July 2025 arrests demonstrably reduced Singapore Straits incidents by ~40-50% in H2 2025. Singapore Straits represented 60% of Q1 2025 incidents (27 of 45). If enforcement persists:
   - Expected Singapore Straits Q1 2026: 27 × 0.5 = ~13-14 incidents
   - Expected other regions Q1 2026: 18 incidents (relatively stable)
   - **Total estimate: 31-32 incidents**

2. **Time elapsed since arrests** (Moderate evidence): 7 months have passed (July 2025 to February 2026). Criminal networks typically need 6-12 months to reorganize after major disruptions. We're in the window where enforcement effects should still be strong but some adaptation may begin.

3. **H2 2025 demonstrated lower rate**: The second half of 2025 saw only 21 incidents (137 total - 116 through Q3 = 21 in Q4), compared to typical quarterly rates of 30-40. This suggests the enforcement effect was sustained for at least 3-6 months.

**Factors warranting UPWARD pressure**:

1. **Criminal network adaptation** (Moderate evidence): By Q1 2026, gangs may have reorganized or new groups emerged. However, no evidence yet of this occurring.

2. **Gulf of Guinea volatility** (Weak-Moderate evidence): The December 2025 kidnapping incident shows ongoing capability, though overall trend remains stable.

3. **Reporting completeness** (Weak evidence): IMB notes late reporting issues, but this affects data quality more than actual incident counts.

**Net assessment**: The structural enforcement change in Singapore Straits is the dominant factor. It directly addresses the region responsible for 58% of 2025's incidents and 60% of Q1 2025's incidents. The demonstrated 40-50% reduction in H2 2025 provides strong empirical evidence that effects persist beyond the immediate aftermath.

**Magnitude of adjustment**: 
- Q1 2025 baseline: 45 incidents
- Singapore Straits reduction: -13 to -14 incidents (50% of 27)
- Expected Q1 2026: 31-33 incidents
- This represents a ~27-31% decrease from Q1 2025

This adjustment is justified because:
- The enforcement action is a **structural change**, not a temporary disruption
- The effect has **persisted for 6+ months** (July 2025 - January 2026)
- The targeted region accounts for **majority of global incidents**
- Multiple independent sources confirm the causal mechanism

However, I must account for uncertainty:
- Criminal networks may reorganize faster than expected
- New hotspots could emerge
- Enforcement may weaken
- Reporting delays could reveal higher numbers later

## Distribution Calibration

**Central tendency reasoning**:
- If enforcement effects fully persist: ~31-33 incidents
- If enforcement effects partially fade (25% recovery): ~34-36 incidents  
- If enforcement effects mostly fade (50% recovery): ~38-40 incidents
- If new surge emerges: 45+ incidents

**Median (50th percentile)**: Should reflect most likely scenario where enforcement effects persist but some adaptation occurs. Setting at **35 incidents** balances:
- Strong enforcement evidence
- 7-month time lag allowing some adaptation
- Historical Q1 median of 38
- Demonstrated H2 2025 reduction

**10th percentile (optimistic for low incidents)**: Enforcement effects strengthen or expand to other regions. Singapore Straits drops to ~10 incidents, other regions stable at ~15. Total: **25 incidents** (below 2023's Q1 of 27, accounting for stronger enforcement)

**90th percentile (pessimistic - high incidents)**: Enforcement effects fade significantly, criminal networks reorganize, or new hotspot emerges. Singapore Straits returns to ~22-25 incidents, other regions increase slightly to ~20-22. Total: **45 incidents** (matching Q1 2025 level)

**Intermediate percentiles**:
- 20th: Enforcement mostly holds, minimal adaptation: **29 incidents**
- 40th: Enforcement holds with slight adaptation: **33 incidents**
- 60th: Moderate adaptation beginning: **37 incidents**
- 80th: Significant adaptation or new activity: **41 incidents**

**Distribution shape**: Slightly right-skewed to account for potential surprise surges, but centered lower than Q1 2025 due to enforcement effects.

**Verification against ±10% shifts**:
- If I shifted all percentiles down 10%: 10th=22.5, 50th=31.5, 90th=40.5
  - This would imply very high confidence in enforcement persistence
  - Seems too optimistic given 7-month lag and adaptation potential
  
- If I shifted all percentiles up 10%: 10th=27.5, 50th=38.5, 90th=49.5
  - This would essentially ignore enforcement effects
  - Contradicts strong evidence of H2 2025 reduction
  - Too pessimistic

My calibrated distribution appropriately balances the strong enforcement evidence with realistic uncertainty about adaptation and new threats.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Number of maritime piracy & armed robbery incidents reported by IMB for Q1 2026 (Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2026). Units: incidents.

2. **Outside view base rate**: Q1 median = 38, recent Q1 mean (2022-2025) = 35.5, Q1 2025 = 45. My prediction shifts downward due to structural enforcement change with demonstrated 6-month persistence.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 35; mean ≈ 35.5. This makes sense given enforcement effects reducing Singapore Straits incidents by ~40-50%, which dominated Q1 2025. Aligns with justification that structural change warrants ~27-31% reduction from Q1 2025's 45.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - July 2025 Indonesian arrests of two gangs caused demonstrated 40-50% reduction in Singapore Straits incidents in H2 2025
   - Singapore Straits accounted for 60% of Q1 2025 incidents (27 of 45); enforcement directly targets highest-volume region
   - H2 2025 sustained lower incident rate (21 in Q4) for 6+ months, suggesting durable enforcement effect
   - Gulf of Guinea and Somalia remain stable/contained at low levels per multiple sources
   - 7-month time lag allows some criminal network adaptation but not full recovery

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Criminal networks reorganized faster than expected and new gangs emerged in Singapore Straits by January 2026, returning incident rates to Q1 2025 levels. This would push outcome UP to 42-48 incidents, making my forecast look too optimistic.

6. **Status quo outcome**: The immediate status quo is the H2 2025 lower rate (~21 incidents per quarter if Q4 rate held). However, Q1 historically shows higher activity than Q4. A reasonable status quo is partial mean reversion toward historical Q1 levels but below Q1 2025. My median of 35 reflects this balanced status quo.

7. **Technicalities**: Percentiles strictly increasing ✓. Units = incidents ✓. Values within bounds (14.5-45.5 stated, but bounds are OPEN so values can exceed) ✓. My 90th percentile of 45 is at the upper stated bound but justified by possibility of matching Q1 2025.
