- Missing data for 2010-2014, 2016-2017

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Q1 incidents 2015-2025** (most suitable)
   - Direct comparison of same quarter across years
   - Available data: 2015 (54), 2018 (66), 2019 (38), 2020 (47), 2021 (38), 2022 (37), 2023 (27), 2024 (33), 2025 (45)
   - Mean: ~42.8, Median: 38, Range: 27-66

2. **Recent Q1 trends (2022-2025)**
   - 2022: 37, 2023: 27, 2024: 33, 2025: 45
   - Shows volatility with recent upward trend
   - Mean: 35.5

3. **Quarterly distribution from annual data**
   - From table: Q1 typically represents 23-39% of annual total
   - 2023: 27/120 = 22.5%, 2024: 33/116 = 28.4%, 2025: 45/137 = 32.8%

**Selected Reference Class:** Q1 incidents 2015-2025, with emphasis on 2022-2025 trend

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** Q1 2026 (January 1 - March 31, 2026)
- Currently February 14, 2026 - approximately 45 days into the quarter
- Resolution date: April 26, 2026 (when Q1 2026 report expected)

**Historical Q1 Patterns:**
- High variability: coefficient of variation ~28%
- Recent trend (2022-2025): 37 → 27 → 33 → 45
- 2025 showed 35% increase over 2024
- Singapore Straits dominated 2024-2025 but saw decline in H2 2025 after July arrests

**Key Factors for Q1 2026:**
1. **Singapore Straits enforcement effect**: July 2025 arrests led to "significant decline" in H2 2025. If sustained, could reduce Q1 2026 incidents
2. **Seasonal patterns**: Q1 typically represents 23-33% of annual total
3. **Gulf of Guinea**: Relatively stable at low levels (5-7 incidents per Q1 recently)
4. **Somalia**: Minimal activity, strong naval deterrent
5. **Reporting lag**: IMB notes late/under-reporting issues

## (d) Justification

The outside view prediction should balance several factors:

**Baseline from recent Q1s (2022-2025):** Mean of 35.5, but with upward trend culminating in 45 for Q1 2025.

**Countervailing factors for Q1 2026:**
- Indonesian Marine Police arrests in July 2025 disrupted Singapore Straits gangs, leading to "significant decline" in H2 2025
- If this enforcement effect persists, Q1 2026 could see fewer incidents than Q1 2025
- However, criminal networks may reorganize over 6+ months

**Supporting factors for continued elevation:**
- 2025 annual total (137) was highest in recent years, suggesting underlying pressure
- Q1 2025's 45 incidents set a high recent baseline
- Gulf of Guinea remains active with kidnapping incidents

**Most likely scenario:** Q1 2026 will likely fall between the 2023 low (27) and 2025 high (45), possibly in the 30-40 range if enforcement effects persist but don't eliminate all activity. The historical Q1 median of 38 provides a reasonable central estimate.

**Uncertainty factors:**
- Unknown effectiveness of continued enforcement
- Potential for new hotspots or gang reformation
- Reporting completeness
- Weather and shipping patterns

Outside view calibration:

Given the historical Q1 data (27-66 range, median 38, recent mean 35.5), I need to construct a distribution that:

1. **Centers around 35-40 incidents** based on recent Q1 averages and enforcement effects
2. **Accounts for downside risk** from sustained enforcement (could approach 2023's 27)
3. **Accounts for upside risk** from gang reorganization or new hotspots (could match or exceed 2025's 45)
4. **Reflects historical volatility** (±30% from mean is common)

The 10th-90th percentile range should span roughly 20-50 incidents to capture:
- 10th percentile: Strong enforcement effect, approaching 2023 levels
- 50th percentile: Moderate enforcement effect, near historical median
- 90th percentile: Limited enforcement effect or new activity surge

I'll avoid overconfidence by setting:
- 10th percentile at 26 (below 2023's 27, accounting for possibility of even stronger enforcement)
- 90th percentile at 52 (above 2025's 45, accounting for potential resurgence)

The distribution should be slightly right-skewed given the recent upward trend and potential for unexpected hotspots.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 26
Percentile 20: 30
Percentile 40: 36
Percentile 60: 40
Percentile 80: 46
Percentile 90: 52
