Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**Primary Sources (High Quality):**

1. **ICC-CCS Annual Report (Jan 15, 2026)** - The authoritative source. Reports 137 total incidents for 2025, with detailed regional breakdown: Singapore Straits (80), Gulf of Guinea (21), Indonesian archipelago (12). Notes significant decline in Singapore Straits incidents in H2 2025 after Indonesian Marine Police arrested two gangs in July 2025. **Factual data with expert opinion from ICC Secretary General John Denton and IMB Director Michael Howlett.**

2. **Historical Q1 Data (Multiple Sources)** - Confirmed Q1 counts: 2023 (27), 2024 (33), 2025 (45). These show clear upward trend of +6 and +12 incidents year-over-year.

**Secondary Sources (Moderate Quality):**

3. **Marine Insight (Jan 21, 2026)** - Confirms 2025 annual data, emphasizes Singapore Straits doubled from 43 (2024) to 80 (2025), but notes sharp H2 decline post-gang arrests.

4. **Multiple News Sources (Jan 15-16, 2026)** - Le Marin, Guardian Nigeria, Mer et Marine, Ouest France all confirm same 137 total for 2025 and regional patterns. Consistent reporting increases confidence.

5. **IMO Monthly Reports Page** - Shows December 2025 report published Jan 29, 2026, but Q1 2026 reports not yet available (expected).

**Incident Reports (Weak-Moderate Quality):**

6. **CGAS Saturn Incident (Dec 3, 2025)** - 9 crew kidnapped off Equatorial Guinea. Confirms Gulf of Guinea remains active threat zone.

7. **Australian Sailors Deaths (Nov 30, 2025)** - Near Madagascar/South Africa. Family fears piracy but unconfirmed. Demonstrates continued risk in less-monitored areas.

**Non-Relevant Sources:**
- Multiple articles about land-based robberies (Bucaramanga, Moscow, Belarus, etc.) - not maritime piracy, excluded from analysis.
- Ukraine/Black Sea conflict articles - explicitly excluded from IMB definition per question background.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Gang Arrests Impact (July 2025)**: Indonesian Marine Police arrested two organized gangs in Singapore Straits mid-2025. Multiple independent sources confirm sharp decline in H2 2025 incidents. This is a structural change with clear causal mechanism. Singapore Straits was 58% of global total in 2025, so this directly impacts Q1 2026 baseline. **Weight: Very High - suggests lower Q1 2026 vs. Q1 2025.**

2. **Established Upward Trend 2023-2025**: Q1 counts rose 27→33→45 (+22% then +36%). Annual totals: 120→116→137. Multiple sources confirm. However, the gang arrests represent a regime change that may break this trend. **Weight: High but diminishing due to structural change.**

**Moderate Evidence:**
3. **Gulf of Guinea Stability**: 21 incidents in 2025 vs. 18 (2024), 22 (2023). Relatively stable but with increased kidnappings (23 vs. 12). Regional cooperation improving but threat persists. **Weight: Moderate - suggests continued but not escalating activity.**

4. **Somali Piracy Containment**: Only 2 incidents in 2025, both in November, far from shore. Naval presence effective. **Weight: Moderate - unlikely to spike in Q1 2026.**

5. **Seasonal Patterns**: No clear Q1 seasonal effect identified in data. Q1 represents roughly 30-35% of annual total historically (45/137 = 33% in 2025, 33/116 = 28% in 2024).

**Weak Evidence:**
6. **Delayed Reporting Concerns**: IMB notes late reporting issues, but this affects data collection, not actual incident rates.

7. **Individual Incidents**: Single kidnapping events don't predict broader trends.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

**Prediction Window**: Q1 2026 = Jan 1 - Mar 31, 2026. Today is Feb 14, so we're 45 days into the 90-day quarter (50% complete). Resolution in ~71 days (Apr 26).

**Critical Consideration**: We're forecasting incidents that are **already occurring** but not yet reported. January 2026 incidents are likely already recorded internally; February incidents are happening now; March is future.

**If timeframe halved (45 days)**: Would increase confidence in status quo continuation - less time for new developments. Would narrow distribution.

**If timeframe doubled (180 days, full H1)**: Would need to account for potential seasonal variations, policy changes, new gang formations. Would widen distribution significantly.

**Current position (50% through)**: Moderate confidence. If January data were available, we'd have strong signal. Currently must rely on structural factors (gang arrests) vs. momentum (upward trend).

**(d) Justification for Shift from Outside View**

**Outside View Baseline**: Centered at 46, range 30-65 (10th-90th percentile).

**Key Factors Warranting Adjustment:**

1. **Gang Arrests = Structural Break**: The July 2025 arrests removed two major organized groups responsible for Singapore Straits surge. This is not a temporary fluctuation but a law enforcement success. Singapore Straits incidents dropped sharply in H2 2025. If this pattern holds through Q1 2026, we should expect:
   - Singapore Straits: ~20-25 incidents (vs. 73 in first 3 quarters of 2025, suggesting ~24-25 in Q1 2025 alone)
   - This alone suggests -15 to -20 incidents vs. Q1 2025's 45

2. **Counter-argument - Momentum**: The +12 increase from Q1 2024→2025 was strong. Other regions (Gulf of Guinea, others) may continue rising even if Singapore Straits falls.

3. **Net Assessment**: The structural change (gang arrests) is more significant than momentum because:
   - Singapore Straits was 58% of 2025 total
   - Gang arrests are harder to reverse than trends
   - H2 2025 data already shows the effect

**Calibrated Shift**: Adjust downward from outside view baseline of 46 to approximately 38-40, with wider uncertainty due to:
- Incomplete information (50% through quarter)
- Possibility of new gang formation
- Other regions compensating

Distribution calibration:

Starting from outside view (46 median, 30-65 range), I adjust for:

1. **Strong downward pressure** from Singapore Straits gang arrests (-8 to -10 incidents expected)
2. **Moderate upward pressure** from Gulf of Guinea stability/slight increase (+2 to +3)
3. **Uncertainty** about whether new groups have formed, whether arrests fully effective

**Calibrated median**: 38-40 (vs. 46 outside view)
**Calibrated range**: Narrower on high end (gang arrests create ceiling), similar on low end (could have exceptional crackdown success)

**Distribution shape**:
- 10th percentile: 28 (exceptional success - multiple regions see crackdowns)
- 20th percentile: 32 (gang arrests very effective, other regions stable)
- 40th percentile: 37 (gang arrests effective, slight increase elsewhere)
- 60th percentile: 42 (gang arrests partially effective, other regions up)
- 80th percentile: 48 (new gangs form quickly, other regions surge)
- 90th percentile: 56 (gang arrests ineffective OR major new hotspot emerges)

This represents a -8 point median shift from outside view, justified by the structural break from gang arrests affecting the dominant region (Singapore Straits = 58% of incidents).

Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Number of maritime piracy & armed robbery incidents in Q1 2026 (Jan 1-Mar 31) per IMB quarterly report. Units: incidents.

2. **Outside view base rate**: Median 46, range 30-65. My prediction shifts to median ~39, range 28-56, justified by structural break (gang arrests) in dominant region.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 39; mean ≈ 40. This represents 28% of 2025 annual total (137), consistent with historical Q1 share of 28-33%. Makes sense given gang arrests reducing Singapore Straits contribution.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - July 2025 Indonesian gang arrests in Singapore Straits (58% of global incidents) with confirmed H2 decline
   - Q1 2025 count was 45, representing recent high point before arrests took effect
   - Gulf of Guinea showing stability at ~21 annual incidents with no major escalation signals
   - Historical Q1 volatility (σ≈12) suggests wide uncertainty remains appropriate
   - We're 50% through the quarter with no visibility into actual January-February data

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: New organized gang(s) rapidly filled vacuum in Singapore Straits after arrests, or major Somali piracy resurgence (unlikely given naval presence). Would push outcome UP toward 50-55 range.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Q1 2025 = 45. Given gang arrests, expecting modest decline to ~38-40 is reasonable. Not assuming dramatic crash (gang arrests need time to show full effect) nor continuation of upward trend (structural break occurred).

7. **Technicalities**: Values strictly increasing, units are "incidents", all values positive integers, within reasonable bounds given historical data.
