Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles:**

1. **Skuld.com (2022 Year in Review)**: Maritime security analysis covering 2022 data. Reports 115 total incidents in 2022 (30-year low), with regional breakdowns. High-quality industry source. Notes Q1 2023 had 5 Gulf of Guinea incidents vs 8 in Q1 2022, and 18 Singapore Straits incidents in Q1 2023.

2. **IIMS.org (IMB 2022 Annual Report)**: Professional maritime organization summary. Confirms 115 incidents in 2022 vs 132 in 2021. Provides detailed breakdown by incident type and region, including 38 Singapore Straits incidents for full year 2022.

3. **gCaptain (Q1 2022 Report, April 2022)**: Maritime news outlet reporting IMB data. States 37 global incidents in Q1 2022 vs 38 in Q1 2021. Includes expert opinion from IMB Director Michael Howlett. Credible secondary source with direct IMB attribution.

4. **gCaptain (Q1 2025 Report, April 2025)**: Reports 45 incidents in Q1 2025, representing 35% increase from Q1 2024 (33 incidents). Singapore Straits had 27 incidents vs 7 in Q1 2024. This is a past event (April 2025 is before our current date of Feb 2026). Highly relevant recent data.

5. **Maritime Fairtrade (December 2025)**: Appears to be retrospective analysis of Q1 2024 data, but the dates are confusing - published Dec 2025 but discussing Q1 2024. The 45 incidents figure matches the Q1 2025 data from gCaptain, suggesting possible mislabeling. Treat with caution.

6. **ICC/IMB Official Report (2025 Annual)**: Primary source. Reports 137 total incidents in 2025 vs 116 in 2024. Singapore Straits had 80 incidents in 2025 (58% of global total). Notes significant decline in second half 2025 after Indonesian Marine Police apprehended gangs in July 2025. Expert opinions from ICC Secretary General and IMB Director included.

**Agent Report:**
Comprehensive compilation of Q1 historical data from 2010-2025. Successfully documents Q1 figures for: 2015 (54), 2018 (66), 2019 (38), 2020 (47), 2021 (38), 2022 (37), 2023 (27), 2024 (33), 2025 (45). Citations appear credible with mix of primary IMB releases and reputable maritime press. Gaps remain for 2010-2014, 2016-2017.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Q1 incidents 2015-2025 (documented years)**: 54, 66, 38, 47, 38, 37, 27, 33, 45
   - Mean: 42.8, Median: 38, Range: 27-66
   - Most suitable: Recent, complete quarterly data matching exact question timeframe

2. **Q1 incidents 2022-2025 (most recent 4 years)**: 37, 27, 33, 45
   - Mean: 35.5, Median: 35, Range: 27-45
   - Highly relevant: Shows recent trend with 2025 spike

3. **2025 quarterly progression**: Q1=45, Q2=45 (90-45), Q3=26 (116-90), Q4=21 (137-116)
   - Shows dramatic decline through year after Q2
   - Critical context: Indonesian Marine Police arrested gangs in July 2025

4. **Annual totals as baseline**: 2022 (115), 2023 (120), 2024 (116), 2025 (137)
   - Less suitable: Doesn't capture quarterly seasonality

**Selected Reference Class**: Q1 incidents 2015-2025, with heavy weighting toward 2022-2025 recent trend.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: Q1 2026 = January 1 - March 31, 2026 (approximately 45-105 days from Feb 14, 2026)

**Historical Q1 Patterns:**
- Q1 typically represents 25-40% of annual incidents
- 2023: Q1=27 of 120 annual (22.5%)
- 2024: Q1=33 of 116 annual (28.4%)
- 2025: Q1=45 of 137 annual (32.8%)

**Key Trends:**
1. **2025 Spike and Correction**: Q1 2025 saw dramatic increase (45 vs 33 in Q1 2024), but 2025 Q3-Q4 showed sharp decline after July gang arrests
2. **Singapore Straits**: Primary driver of variation - 27 incidents in Q1 2025 vs 7 in Q1 2024
3. **Law Enforcement Impact**: Indonesian Marine Police intervention in July 2025 significantly reduced incidents in H2 2025
4. **Recent Quarterly Pattern in 2025**: Q1=45, Q2=45, Q3=26, Q4=21 (declining trend post-intervention)

## (d) Justification

The outside view should center on Q1 historical data (27-66 range over documented years, mean ~43) but adjust for critical 2025 developments:

**Upward Pressures:**
- Q1 2025 established new recent high at 45 incidents
- Singapore Straits remains high-activity zone
- Gulf of Guinea continues generating incidents

**Downward Pressures:**
- Indonesian Marine Police gang arrests in July 2025 showed sustained effect (Q3=26, Q4=21)
- If enforcement continues, Q1 2026 could remain suppressed
- 2025 H2 average was 23.5 incidents/quarter vs Q1-Q2 average of 45

**Base Rate Calculation:**
Given the enforcement intervention effect persisting through Q4 2025, Q1 2026 likely falls between:
- Lower bound: Recent suppressed levels (Q3-Q4 2025 average = 23.5)
- Upper bound: Pre-intervention Q1 levels (Q1 2025 = 45)
- Most likely: Modest rebound from Q4 2025 (21) but below Q1 2025 (45), suggesting 28-38 range

Historical Q1 minimum (documented) is 27 (2023), maximum is 66 (2018), but recent 4-year range is 27-45.

Outside view calibration:

**Tethering to Established Distributions:**
The Q1 2022-2025 data provides: 37, 27, 33, 45 (mean=35.5, std dev≈7.8)

**Key Calibration Factors:**

1. **Enforcement Persistence**: The July 2025 gang arrests created a structural break. Q4 2025's 21 incidents suggests sustained suppression, but Q1 seasonality typically shows uptick.

2. **Rebound Potential**: Q1 historically runs higher than Q4 (comparing 2023-2024 patterns). Expect some rebound from 21, but unlikely to reach 45 without new gang activity.

3. **Uncertainty Ranges**: 
   - 10th percentile should capture scenario where enforcement fully holds (near Q4 2025 level)
   - 90th percentile should capture scenario where new gangs emerge or enforcement lapses (approaching Q1 2025 level)

4. **Distribution Shape**: Slightly right-skewed given potential for unexpected surge (new gangs, enforcement gaps) vs limited downside below ~18-20 incidents.

**Tail Considerations:**
- Lower tail: Unlikely to drop below 18 (would require unprecedented enforcement success)
- Upper tail: Could reach 50+ if Singapore Straits activity rebounds to Q1 2025 levels, but 60+ would require multiple regional surges

**Rate of Upsets**: Maritime piracy shows moderate volatility with occasional structural breaks (gang arrests, naval operations). The 2025 data shows both spike (Q1-Q2) and correction (Q3-Q4), suggesting ~25% chance of outcomes outside ±10 from median.

Setting distribution with:
- Central tendency: 30-35 (modest rebound from Q4 2025's 21, but well below Q1 2025's 45)
- 10th-90th range: 20-42 (accounting for enforcement persistence vs seasonal rebound)

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 20
Percentile 20: 25
Percentile 40: 31
Percentile 60: 35
Percentile 80: 39
Percentile 90: 42
