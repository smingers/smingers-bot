Analysis:
### 1) Target variable / resolution criteria
The question resolves to the **number of IMB-reported maritime piracy & armed robbery incidents occurring in Q1 2026 (Jan 1–Mar 31, 2026), units = incidents**, as stated in the IMB Q1 2026 quarterly report.

### (a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; facts vs opinions)
**Primary / high-quality**
- **ICC/IMB annual report on 2025 (published Jan 2026; ICC/IMB)**  
  *Quality:* Highest (primary source for the same metric).  
  *Facts used:* 2025 total = 137; quarterly cumulative series implies **Q1 2025 = 45, Q4 2025 quarter = 21**. Regional detail: **Singapore Straits = 80 in 2025**; **decline in incidents in 2H 2025 after Indonesian Marine Police arrests in July 2025**.  
  *Opinions:* IMB/ICC leadership emphasizing need for cooperation; I treat these as qualitative context, not a quantitative forecast.

**Relevant secondary but lower directness**
- **Marine Insight / Ouest France / Mer et Marine / Guardian.ng / Le Marin (mid-Jan 2026)**  
  *Quality:* Medium (secondary summaries of the same IMB annual report).  
  *Facts used:* Mostly repeats the IMB 2025 stats and the “decline after July arrests” narrative. Useful as corroboration but not independent data.

- **Newsbase (Dec 3, 2025) kidnapping off Equatorial Guinea (security firms cited)**  
  *Quality:* Medium (incident reporting; plausible; not IMB itself).  
  *Facts used:* Confirms Gulf of Guinea kidnap-for-ransom risk persists.  
  *Caveat:* May not map 1:1 into IMB counting/definitions and does not quantify Q1 2026.

- **MarineLink (Jan 22, 2026) citing Palaemon Maritime weekly report**  
  *Quality:* Medium-low for our exact metric (mixture of conflict incidents + some robbery).  
  *Facts used:* Mentions at least a couple **armed robbery/attempt** type events (more likely IMB-relevant), but provides no totals and includes many non-IMB-qualifying conflict strikes.

**Mostly irrelevant to IMB piracy/armed robbery count**
- **Gard article on Black Sea war risks (Jan 2026 update)**: conflict/mine/electronic warfare risk; generally *not* IMB piracy/armed robbery under UNCLOS/IMO A.1025.  
- **IMO piracy reports index page**: directory only; no Q1 2026 content yet.  
- **ICC informational page about IMB (Jan 15, 2026)**: promotional/institutional; no counts/forecast.  
- **AskNews crime articles (Belarus/Moscow/Puebla/etc.)**: land crime; irrelevant to maritime IMB incident count.  
- **Steamship Mutual PDF extraction corrupted**: unusable.

### (b) Evidence analysis (weighted factors)
**Strong evidence (big weight)**
1) **Structural break signal in late-2025 quarterly pattern:** 2025 quarters implied by cumulative data: **Q1 45, Q2 45, Q3 26, Q4 21**. This is a large regime shift downward in the second half.  
2) **Causal mechanism identified by IMB:** July 2025 Indonesian Marine Police arrests of two gangs coinciding with a “significant decline” in incidents in the Singapore Straits (the dominant global hotspot in 2025). If sustained, it should continue suppressing the largest driver of the global total.

**Moderate evidence (moderate weight)**
3) **Gulf of Guinea remains capable of producing high-severity events (kidnappings)** (Newsbase + IMB annual regional stats). This supports a non-trivial floor and right-tail risk (kidnap events can cluster).  
4) **Anecdotal early-2026 robbery/attempt reporting** (MarineLink/Palaemon) suggests incidents have not “gone to zero,” consistent with a rebound from the very low Q4 2025 quarter—but it’s not quantified.

**Weak evidence (small weight)**
5) General macro/geopolitical maritime insecurity (Black Sea, etc.)—many events won’t count under IMB piracy/armed robbery definitions, so only weakly informative.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time left until the quarter ends:** from **today (Feb 14, 2026)** to **Mar 31, 2026 ≈ 45 days** remaining in the *event window*, though resolution is when the IMB report is published (by Apr 26, 2026).  
- Because **over half of Q1 has already occurred** (Jan 1–Feb 14), the true answer is already partly “baked in.” With limited visibility into January/early-February incidents, I avoid over-tightening.
- If the remaining time were **halved** (~3 weeks left), I’d **narrow** the distribution modestly (less remaining variance) but keep tails due to reporting volatility.  
- If the remaining time were **doubled** (as if forecasting a half-year), I’d **widen** the distribution substantially because piracy dynamics can shift quickly with enforcement and gang adaptation.

### (d) Justification (inside view adjustments vs outside view)
**Outside-view baseline (given):** centered around low-30s with wide tails, reflecting (i) recent Q1 history and (ii) the H2 2025 suppression.

**Inside-view update: small downward nudge + slightly fatter right tail**
- **Downward pull on central estimates:** The most powerful driver (Singapore Straits) saw a reported post-arrest decline in H2 2025, and we do not yet see strong evidence of a full relapse to early-2025 levels. That makes a repeat of **Q1 2025 = 45** less likely than the outside view’s upper range might suggest.
- **But keep meaningful upside tail:** Criminal adaptation / displacement is common: if enforcement intensity wanes, or new groups emerge, Singapore Straits counts can jump quickly (recently demonstrated by the 2024→2025 surge). Gulf of Guinea kidnap activity adds additional tail risk.
- **Status quo if nothing changes:** extrapolating from **Q3–Q4 2025 average ≈ 23.5 incidents/quarter**, then adding typical Q1 seasonality/rebound suggests something like **~28–35** rather than low-20s.

Net: I keep the median in the low-30s, reduce the probability mass near 45 a bit, but still allow outcomes modestly above 45 in the 90th percentile.

Distribution calibration
- **Outside view distribution (provided):** P10 20, P20 25, P40 31, P60 35, P80 39, P90 42.
- **Inside view changes:**
  - Shift P40/P60 down slightly (continued enforcement effect).
  - Widen the upper tail somewhat (allow relapse/adaptation; possible clustering).
  - Keep lower tail slightly below 20 to reflect possibility that H2 2025 suppression persists unusually strongly.

Checklist:
1) **Paraphrase:** IMB count of piracy & armed robbery incidents occurring **during Q1 2026**, units **incidents**, per IMB Q1 2026 report.
2) **Outside view base rate:** (20,25,31,35,39,42) at (10/20/40/60/80/90).
3) **Consistency:** Implied median ≈ 32 (between P40=30 and P60=34); mean ≈ low-30s; consistent with post-H2-2025 suppression + modest Q1 rebound.
4) **Key evidence (most significant):**
   - 2025 quarterly implied: **45, 45, 26, 21** (big drop in H2).
   - **Singapore Straits dominated 2025 (80 incidents)** and **declined after July 2025 arrests** (IMB).
   - Gulf of Guinea still produces kidnap incidents (right-tail risk).
   - Some early-2026 robbery/attempt anecdotes exist but no sign of a broad surge yet.
5) **Blind spot:** A rapid, under-the-radar resurgence in Singapore Straits incidents in Jan–Mar 2026 (or reporting changes) could push the outcome **well above** my median.
6) **Status quo outcome:** Continue H2-2025 regime → low-30s for Q1 fits “world changes slowly.”
7) **Technicalities:** Percentiles strictly increasing; units incidents; tails allowed beyond bounds; no scientific notation.
