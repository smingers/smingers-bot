Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological order, January–February 2026)

1. ICC/IMB annual press release (15 Jan 2026).  
   • Facts: 137 incidents in 2025; 80 in Singapore Straits, fall in 2H 2025 after July arrests.  
   • Opinions: IMB Director stresses continued vigilance.  
   • Quality: Highest (primary source).

2. Media echoes of the same release (Marine Insight, Le Marin, Guardian etc.).  
   • Facts reproduce the 137 figure and regional breakdown.  
   • Opinions: Journalistic colour; no new data.  
   • Quality: Good but derivative.

3. MarineLink weekly security wrap-up (22 Jan 2026).  
   • Facts: Lists several conflict-related strikes plus two petty robberies.  
   • Relevance: Only the two robberies fall under IMB definitions; illustrates noise from non-piracy security events.  
   • Quality: Moderate; anecdotal.

4. IMO index page (29 Jan 2026) – no Q1 2026 data yet.  
   • Quality: Directory only; no factual content for forecast.

5. Gard Black Sea mine article (09 Jan 2026).  
   • Facts: Conflict-driven risks, but mines/strikes are outside IMB piracy definition.  
   • Quality: Reliable for conflict context, weak relevance to piracy count.

6. AskNews bundle (Feb 2026). Nearly all articles relate to land crime or war crimes, not IMB-defined piracy.  
   • Quality: Low relevance.

Net: The only strong, incident-count information is the IMB 2025 press release plus the historical quarterly table given in the question prompt.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighing)

Strong evidence  
• IMB 2025 press release: 80/137 incidents located in Singapore Straits, but sharp drop in 2H 2025 after police arrests. (direction: downward vs 1H 2025 spike)  
• Prompt’s quarterly series: Q1 counts 27 (2023) → 33 (2024) → 45 (2025) and half-quarter scaling implies ≈19 incidents for Feb 14–Mar 31 under “typical” regime.

Moderate evidence  
• Gulf of Guinea remained steady at 21 for full-year 2025; kidnap-for-ransom threat persists (adds a thin upside tail).  
• Historical variability: full-Q1 counts 37–66 (2018–2022) → evidence that spikes are possible but rare for the 46-day sub-window.

Weak evidence  
• Individual anecdotal robbery reports in January 2026; sample too small to shift totals.  
• Conflict-related missile/drone strikes (IMB does not log as piracy).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• 46 days of incident accumulation left (14 Feb – 31 Mar 2026).  
• 71 days until resolution publication.  
If time window were halved (23 days), median would fall roughly to 12. If doubled (full 90-day Q1), median would rise to about 38.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  

Outside-view (scaled) median ≈ 19.  
Adjustments:

1. Singapore Straits enforcement continuing (strong evidence) – expect lower run-rate than Q1 2025. Shift −2 incidents.  
2. No new high-impact deterrence failures reported YTD 2026. Neutral.  
3. Persistent Gulf of Guinea kidnapping risk. +1 incident to right tail only.  
4. Reporting delay risk: some January incidents (already occurred but excluded by resolution rule) may raise awareness and encourage February-March reporting. Small +1.

Net median 19 → 20-21, with somewhat fatter right tail than left.

Distribution calibration:

I model incidents as an over-dispersed Poisson with mean ≈21 and σ ≈6. That yields the following percentile curve, then widened 10 % to allow for unknown unknowns.

Checklist:

1. Target: “Number of IMB-recorded maritime piracy & armed-robbery incidents occurring 14 Feb – 31 Mar 2026 (units = incidents).”  
2. Base-rate distribution centred on 19 (outside view) acknowledged.  
3. Consistency: Implied median = 21; mean ≈ 22; aligns with reasoning.  
4. Key evidence: a) 80/137 Singapore Straits 2025 but post-July decline, b) Q1 history 27-45, c) enforcement arrests July 2025, d) steady Gulf of Guinea baseline.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden resurgence in Singapore Straits due to new gang → outcome >40.  
6. Status-quo tilt: gradual drift not upheaval ⇒ slight pull toward 20.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, units = incidents, within open bounds.
