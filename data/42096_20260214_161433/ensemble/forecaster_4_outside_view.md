Analysis:  
----------------------------------------------------------------  
(a) Source analysis  
1. ICC-CCS (“Global maritime piracy and armed robbery increased in 2025”, Jan-2026).  
   • Factual: 2025 global total = 137; regional breakdown; remarks on Singapore Straits, Gulf of Guinea.  
   • Quality: Primary data from the organisation that will also publish the Q1-2026 figure; very reliable.  
   • Date: January 2026 – the most recent annual data available.  
   • Opinion: Cautionary comments by ICC Secretary General and IMB Director – taken as expert opinion.  

2. gCaptain (Apr-2025 & Apr-2022 articles).  
   • Factual: Q1-2025 = 45 incidents; Q1-2022 = 37 incidents; regional details.  
   • Quality: Trade press quoting the quarterly IMB PDF; regarded as accurate but second-hand.  
   • Date: Contemporary with the relevant quarters.  

3. Maritime Fairtrade (Dec-2025).  
   • Factual: Confirms 45 incidents in Q1-2025, 33 in Q1-2024, 27 in Q1-2023; regional split.  
   • Quality: Secondary source but cites IMB numbers verbatim; acceptable.  

4. Agent-compiled table of Q1 counts 2015-2025.  
   • Factual: Collates press releases and PDFs; clearly separates sourced vs. unsourced cells.  
   • Quality: Mixed—numbers marked as sourced are reliable, missing years flagged.  
   • Date: Feb-2026 summary of historic material.  

I deliberately discount unsourced social-media commentary and non-expert opinion pieces.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. “All Q1 global IMB counts 2015-2025” (n≈9).  
2. “Annual IMB totals 2015-2025 transformed to Q1 with a fixed share”.  
3. “Singapore-Straits incidents Q1 2018-2025” (dominant hotspot).  

Class 1 is preferred: it is directly the target metric, contains the most observations and already incorporates whatever mixture of regional hot-spots existed in each year. Class 2 adds model error (assumed constant share). Class 3 is too narrow because it ignores Gulf of Guinea, South America, etc.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
• Today: 14 Feb 2026.  
• Outcome published: mid-Apr 2026 (≈60 days away).  
• Q1 covers 1 Jan – 31 Mar; we are halfway through that window.  
Historical quarter-to-quarter volatility is high: sample standard deviation of 2015-2025 Q1 counts ≈ 12 incidents on a mean of ≈ 43 (coefficient of variation ≈ 0.28). Single-year swings of ±12 (e.g., +12 from 2024 to 2025) are not unusual.

(d) Justification for outside-view baseline  
1. Long-run mean of known Q1 counts 2015-2025 = 43.  
2. Median = 41.  The central tendency therefore sits just above 40.  
3. Recent trend is upward: +6 incidents 2023→2024, +12 incidents 2024→2025.  Extrapolating that linear change naively would suggest ~55 for 2026, but two-year trends are noisy and can reverse (e.g., 2018→2019 fell -28).  
4. Regional context:  
   • Singapore Straits gang arrests (mid-2025) removed two active groups, so early-2026 activity there could plateau or decline.  
   • Gulf of Guinea kidnappings ticked up in 2025, but the absolute incident count (21) is still modest.  
   • No new major piracy theatres have emerged.  
5. Combining (1)–(4) I weight 70 % on “reversion toward mean” (≈42) and 30 % on “continuation of recent rise” (+10).  That yields a point anchor ≈ 45–46.  
6. Dispersion: With an historical σ≈12, a two-sided 80 % interval (±1.28 σ) is ≈ 28–58.  I widen slightly for model/measurement uncertainty, giving ≈ 26–60.  
7. Fat tails: very low but non-zero probability of an exceptional spike (e.g., Somali flare-up) or crash (major regional crackdown).  I allocate 10th/90th percentiles outside the 80 % band to 30/65 to capture those possibilities.

Outside view calibration:  
• Distribution anchored at 46.  
• Shape: roughly normal but with mild extra kurtosis—implemented by putting the 20th/80th further from the median than a perfect Gaussian.  
• Consistency check: The 90th (65) is below the 2018 high (66) but allows for another step-change upward; the 10th (30) is above the 2023 historical low (27) yet still materially lower than recent counts, reflecting stickiness once a surge has occurred.  
• Percentiles increase monotonically and give an 80 % range 35 incidents wide, which matches the historical coefficient of variation and leaves room for black-swans without over-weighting them.

Outside View Prediction (number of incidents in Q1 2026):  
Percentile 10: 30  
Percentile 20: 35  
Percentile 40: 42  
Percentile 60: 48  
Percentile 80: 55  
Percentile 90: 65
