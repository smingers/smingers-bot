Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. ICC-IMB annual report (15 Jan 2026) – Primary data on 2025 totals and regional split; highly reliable, factual.  
2. Marine Insight / Guardian / Le Marin pieces (21-16 Jan 2026) – Trade press reproducing ICC-IMB figures; corroborative, reliable.  
3. ICC-IMB press release on Q1 2025 (Apr 2025, quoted widely) – Gives 45 global incidents, 27 in Singapore Straits; primary, strong.  
4. MarineLink weekly security roundup (22 Jan 2026) – Secondary; two robbery events meet IMB criteria, the rest are conflict-related; limited but timely.  
5. News flow Jan-Feb 2026 (AskNews bundle) – No reports of large-scale piracy clusters; only isolated armed robberies; anecdotal, weak.  

(b) Evidence weighting  
• Strong: 2025 annual data + IMB commentary that incidents in Singapore Straits fell sharply in H2 2025 after July arrests.  
• Moderate: Early-2026 press noting only sporadic robbery events.  
• Weak: General security concerns in Black Sea and Red-Sea areas (out of scope for IMB piracy definition).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• 45 days of the 90-day quarter have elapsed; IMB will publish about 10 weeks from now.  
• Halving the time left (to mid-Mar) would marginally reduce uncertainty; doubling (to end-Q2) would re-open upside risk from Gulf of Guinea and SE-Asia seasonality.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view anchor (μ≈45, σ≈11) assumed the Q1 2025 growth path would persist.  Three current factors pull the forecast down:  
1. Singapore Straits enforcement – IMB called the H2 2025 drop “significant”; assuming a 35-40 % reduction vs Q1 2025 trims 8-10 incidents.  
2. Absence of early-2026 spike signals – no hijackings or kidnapping clusters reported yet.  Trim a further 3-4 incidents.  
3. Offsetting upward pressures – Gulf of Guinea kidnaps ticked up in 2025 and could add 1-2 extra incidents, so claw back ~2 incidents.  

Net adjustment ≈ –9 incidents to the 45-incident base → median ≈36.  Retain a fat right tail (Somalia or Gulf of Guinea flare-up) but also allow a left tail if Singapore Straits remains quiet all quarter.  Final σ chosen so the 10th–90th span (33 incidents wide) covers plausible shocks.

Distribution calibration
I model a slightly right-skewed distribution with mean 38–39, median 36–37.  Rounded percentiles:

Percentile 10: 25  
Percentile 20: 30  
Percentile 40: 36  
Percentile 60: 42  
Percentile 80: 50  
Percentile 90: 58  

Checklist:
1. Target variable: global IMB-recorded piracy & armed-robbery incidents occurring 1 Jan–31 Mar 2026, count of incidents.  
2. Base-rate distribution: N(45, 11²) from Q1 2015-25 data.  
3. Consistency: implied median ≈ 36, mean ≈ 39 – lower than 2025 Q1 and consistent with enforcement effect.  
4. Top drivers:  
   • Singapore Straits gang arrests cut incident rate (factual, IMB).  
   • Q4 2025 incidents only 21 vs 37 in 2024 (factual).  
   • No January-February 2026 piracy clusters reported yet (observational).  
   • Gulf of Guinea kidnappings creeping up (factual, IMB).  
5. Blind-spot: sudden Somali or Singapore Straits resurgence in March could push total above 60.  
6. Status-quo tilt: year-on-year growth paused in H2 2025; distribution already shifted downward.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units = incidents; open bounds respected.
