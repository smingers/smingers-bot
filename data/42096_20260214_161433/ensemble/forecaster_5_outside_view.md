Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
1. ICC “Global maritime piracy and armed robbery increased in 2025” (January 2026).  
   • Primary source: ICC/IMB. Factual numbers (annual 2022-25 counts, regional splits) are highly reliable.  Opinions (e.g., “concerning rise”) are advocacy-oriented but credible because they come from the reporting body’s Director.  
2. gCaptain 15 Apr 2025 & Maritime Fairtrade 09 Dec 2025.  
   • Trade-press quoting the official Q1-2025 IMB report. Figures (45 global incidents; 27 in Singapore Straits) are consistent across outlets → good reliability.  Commentary is journalistic.  
3. gCaptain 13 Apr 2022, Skuld & IIMS 2023/2022 summaries.  
   • Secondary descriptions of the IMB reports.  Good concordance with IMB numbers, but one step removed.  Used only for longer-run context.  
4. Agent-report table (2010-2025 Q1 counts).  
   • Collates a mix of primary press-releases and secondary articles.  I treat pre-2018 figures as provisional; the 2018-25 entries line up with the better-sourced trade-press, giving me moderate confidence.

b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
i. All-year global piracy counts (too coarse; seasonality matters).  
ii. Q1 global counts 2015-2025 (11 observations).  
iii. Q1 counts since the current Singapore-Straits surge began (2023-25).  
iv. Q1 counts in years that followed a >15 % rise in the previous full-year total (e.g., 2018, 2020, 2025).  

Choice: ii gives the longest run that still matches the quarterly resolution.  I will start with that, then weight recent trend (iii) in the adjustment step.

Distribution of Q1 incidents 2015-25 (n = 11): 27, 33, 37, 38, 38, 45, 47, 54, 66.  
Mean ≈ 43, stdev ≈ 12.5.  Middle 80 % roughly spans 30-60 incidents.

c) Time-frame analysis  
Today: 14 Feb 2026.  Six and a half weeks remain in Q1 and ~10 weeks until the IMB report is published.  In the past, ~60 % of Q1 incidents occur in Jan-Feb (Sin Straits activity is steady; Gulf of Guinea spikes often happen in March/April).  Because we are early in the quarter and live feeds are sparse, I assume we have little hard inside data—appropriate for an outside view.

d) Justification  
• Structural drivers of the 2025 jump (Singapore Straits gangs, modest rebound in Gulf of Guinea activity) are partly temporary: two Singapore gangs were arrested mid-2025 and IMB noted a “significant decline” in H2-2025 there.  That trims the growth trajectory.  
• Conversely, macro pressures (higher freight rates, lingering economic dislocation in coastal states, and navies re-deployed from the Red Sea crisis) plausibly keep incident numbers above the 2023-24 level.  
• Taking the historical mean of 43 as a neutral anchor, I adjust –5 % to reflect the H2-2025 enforcement success, and +10 % to account for ordinary year-on-year drift and under-reporting awareness.  Net: +5 % → point anchor ≈ 45.  
• Uncertainty: piracy data are noisy; a single cluster of boardings in Singapore or a tanker hijacking off West Africa can move the quarterly total by 8-10.  So I retain a broad 10th-to-90th range of roughly ±15 around the anchor, skewed slightly right because upside shocks (e.g., Somalia flare-up) historically tail heavier than downside shocks.

Outside view calibration:
I fit a simple normal with μ = 45, σ = 11, then widen tails by 15 % to acknowledge “unknown unknowns” and truncate at zero.  That yields:

• 10th ≈ 30  
• 20th ≈ 35  
• 40th ≈ 42  
• 60th ≈ 48  
• 80th ≈ 55  
• 90th ≈ 60  

Vis-à-vis the platform bounds (14.5, 45.5), my central mass sits above the midpoint, but the 10th still well above the lower open bound and the 90th modestly above the historical maximum of 66, which feels appropriately cautious.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 30  
Percentile 20: 35  
Percentile 40: 42  
Percentile 60: 48  
Percentile 80: 55  
Percentile 90: 60
