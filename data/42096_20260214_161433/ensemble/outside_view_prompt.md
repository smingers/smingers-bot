You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
How many maritime piracy & armed robbery incidents will the International Maritime Bureau report for Q1 2026?

Question background:
In its annual report, the [International Maritime Bureau](https://icc-ccs.org) (IMB) [reported](https://icc-ccs.org/global-maritime-piracy-and-armed-robbery-increased-in-2025/) 137 maritime piracy and armed robbery incidents for 2025. The incident count maintains a concerning upward trend in piracy from 2024 (116), 2023 (120) and 2022 (41).

The IMB tracks incidents through its [Piracy Reporting Centre](https://icc-ccs.org/imb-piracy-reporting-centre-2/) which largely relies on in situ reports:

> Establish in 1992, IMB PRC offers a 24-hour and free service for shipmasters to report any piracy, armed robbery or stowaway incidents.

Maritime piracy and armed robbery are defined in Article 101 of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and IMO Resolution A.1025 (26) respectively. Under the definition, incidents such as the Houthi attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea do not count.

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide International Maritime Bureau quarterly reports list with incident counts for every Q1 from 2010 through 2025, citing sources.
Objective
Compile a year-by-year list of the number of piracy & armed-robbery incidents that the ICC-International Maritime Bureau (IMB) recorded in every first quarter (Q1) from 2010 through 2025 and document the provenance of every figure.

Findings to date  
Where a contemporary IMB press release or the official PDF is publicly indexed, that is cited first; otherwise a reputable trade-press article that explicitly states it is quoting the quarterly IMB report is used.

Assessment of completeness
•  Nine of the sixteen required Q1 data points (2015, 2018–2025 except 2016-17) are now supported by an external citation.  
•  The counts for 2010-2014 as well as 2016 and 2017 remain undocumented.  No credible source surfaced in the current search set.  
•  For 2015, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025 the figures have at least one secondary-source citation; however, stronger provenance could still be achieved by retrieving the original IMB PDFs (“Piracy and Armed Robbery against Ships – 01 Jan-31 Mar [year]”) from ICC-CCS for each of those years.

Information gaps still to close
1. Incident counts for Q1 2010, 2011, 2012, 2013, 2014, 2016 and 2017.  
2. Preferably, an ICC-CCS or other direct IMB document for every year now sourced only through secondary press (2018-2022, 2024-2025, and the two SailWorldCruising counts).

Recommended next steps / new searches
Because the years still missing pre-date the IMB’s current website layout, targeted filename and vintage-date searches against the ICC-CCS domain and maritime-news archives offer the best chance of recovery.  Suggested Google queries (all six words or fewer, none duplicate earlier searches) are:  
1. 01 Jan 31 Mar 2010 IMB (Google)  
2. ICC IMB Q1 2011 piracy (Google)  
3. first quarter 2014 piracy report IMB (Google)  
4. 2016 IMB piracy 01 Jan-31 Mar pdf (Google)  
5. 2017 IMB April piracy report (Google)  

Until those gaps are filled, the table above remains provisional; nevertheless it already supplies 60 % of the requested historic Q1 series (2010-2025) and fully documents the more recent decade which is most relevant when extrapolating to Q1 2026.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
