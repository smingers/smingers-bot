Analysis:
The key to forecasting Q1-2026 incidents is knowing how many attacks have already occurred in the first six weeks of the quarter and whether any new clusters or counter-measures are emerging. Useful information includes:
• Any ad-hoc incident alerts or live maps published by the IMB Piracy Reporting Centre for Jan–Feb 2026.  
• Regional navy or coast-guard press releases (e.g., Gulf of Guinea, Singapore Strait) that might not yet have appeared in the IMB tally but signal an upward or downward trend.  
• Commentary from maritime security firms (Dryad, Ambrey, Risk Intelligence) that track daily events.  
• News on government or industry actions (convoys, patrol increases) that could suppress incidents during the remainder of Q1.  
The queries therefore aim to pull (1) direct IMB updates, (2) very recent journalism on 2026 incidents, and (3) a comprehensive incident list through AskNews that aggregates shipping advisories and official statements.
