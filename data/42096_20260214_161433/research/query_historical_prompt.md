You are currently doing research for historical information on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
How many maritime piracy & armed robbery incidents will the International Maritime Bureau report for Q1 2026?

Question background:
In its annual report, the [International Maritime Bureau](https://icc-ccs.org) (IMB) [reported](https://icc-ccs.org/global-maritime-piracy-and-armed-robbery-increased-in-2025/) 137 maritime piracy and armed robbery incidents for 2025. The incident count maintains a concerning upward trend in piracy from 2024 (116), 2023 (120) and 2022 (41).

The IMB tracks incidents through its [Piracy Reporting Centre](https://icc-ccs.org/imb-piracy-reporting-centre-2/) which largely relies on in situ reports:

> Establish in 1992, IMB PRC offers a 24-hour and free service for shipmasters to report any piracy, armed robbery or stowaway incidents.

Maritime piracy and armed robbery are defined in Article 101 of the 1982 United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and IMO Resolution A.1025 (26) respectively. Under the definition, incidents such as the Houthi attacks on merchant ships in the Red Sea do not count.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-14. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-14 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

The lower bound is 14.5 and the upper bound is 45.5.
Both bounds are OPEN: outcomes can fall below the lower bound or above the upper bound. Your percentile estimates may extend beyond this range if well-supported by evidence.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic or financial data, add a FRED query. Use a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate") or a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE"). Returns historical data with computed statistics.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one Agent query.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant historical context needed to generate an outside view.}

Search queries:
1. your query here (Google)
2. your query here (Google News)
3. your query here (Agent)
4. economic indicator query (FRED) -- only if question involves economic/financial data
