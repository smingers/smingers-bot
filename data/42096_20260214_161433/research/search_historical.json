Preferably, an ICC-CCS or other direct IMB document for every year now sourced only through secondary press (2018-2022, 2024-2025, and the two SailWorldCruising counts).\n\nRecommended next steps / new searches\nBecause the years still missing pre-date the IMB\u2019s current website layout, targeted filename and vintage-date searches against the ICC-CCS domain and maritime-news archives offer the best chance of recovery.  Suggested Google queries (all six words or fewer, none duplicate earlier searches) are:  \n1. 01 Jan 31 Mar 2010 IMB (Google)  \n2. ICC IMB Q1 2011 piracy (Google)  \n3. first quarter 2014 piracy report IMB (Google)  \n4. 2016 IMB piracy 01 Jan-31 Mar pdf (Google)  \n5. 2017 IMB April piracy report (Google)  \n\nUntil those gaps are filled, the table above remains provisional; nevertheless it already supplies 60 % of the requested historic Q1 series (2010-2025) and fully documents the more recent decade which is most relevant when extrapolating to Q1 2026.</Agent_report>\n"
