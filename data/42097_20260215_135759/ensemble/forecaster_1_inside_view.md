Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**TSA.gov official data (through Feb 12, 2026):**
Primary government source showing 8.9M passengers Feb 9-12, 2026. Highest quality factual data. Current through 3 days before forecast opening.

**Google Spreadsheet TSA compilation (Feb 1-8, 2026):**
Secondary source showing 7-day rolling averages of 14.2-14.5M with YoY growth of 13.5-21.1%. Reliable replication of official data.

**TSA 2025 archive (Feb 23-Mar 1, 2025):**
Primary source: **16,405,121 passengers** for the exact target week in 2025. Critical baseline. Factual.

**Government shutdown articles (Feb 14, 2026 - multiple sources):**
**BREAKING NEWS**: DHS shutdown began Feb 14, 2026. TSA agents working without pay. Multiple expert sources (John Rose/Altour, Rich Davis/International SOS, travel industry associations) warn of longer security lines, potential delays, and increased risk of TSA call-outs. This is occurring during our target week (Feb 23-Mar 1). Strong factual basis with expert consensus on operational risks.

**Weather forecasts (Feb 2, 2026 articles):**
AccuWeather meteorologist Chad Merrill and Paul Pastelok predict extended winter conditions through March 2026 in Northeast, Great Lakes, Pacific Northwest. Late-season snow and frost expected. Factual weather predictions from identifiable meteorologists.

**Air Transat/WestJet cancellations (Feb 13, 2026):**
Air Transat canceling all US flights starting June 2026. Canadian-US travel at "record lows" in early 2026. Factual but affects only cross-border segment.

**China Spring Festival travel (Feb 2, 2026):**
China expecting 95M civil aviation passengers Feb 2-Mar 13, 2026. Not directly relevant to US TSA volumes but indicates global travel trends. Factual but geographically distinct.

**Post-Thanksgiving 2025 record (Dec 2, 2025):**
TSA screened 3,133,924 passengers Nov 30, 2025—new single-day record. All top 10 busiest days occurred in 2024-2025. Factual, shows strong pre-shutdown trend.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE (Major downward pressure):**
- **Government shutdown starting Feb 14, 2026**: Multiple independent sources (AP, CNBC, Travel & Tour World, Boston Globe) confirm 50,000 TSA agents working without pay during our target week. Expert consensus warns of operational disruptions, longer lines, potential flight delays. Historical precedent from 2024's 43-day shutdown caused "mass cancellations and long airport lines." This is a structural factor directly impacting screening capacity during Feb 23-Mar 1.
  - Direction: **Strongly downward** (could reduce volumes 5-15%)

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**
- **Extended winter weather**: Named meteorologists (Chad Merrill, Paul Pastelok) predict late-season snow/frost in Northeast, Great Lakes, Pacific Northwest through March 2026. Could suppress discretionary travel during target week.
  - Direction: **Moderately downward** (2-5% impact)

- **REAL ID fee implementation (Feb 1, 2026)**: New $45 fee affecting 6% of travelers, potential 30-minute delays. Two weeks into implementation by target week—early friction period.
  - Direction: **Moderately downward** (1-3% impact)

- **Canadian travel decline**: Record lows in Canadian-US travel, major carriers cutting routes. Affects international segment.
  - Direction: **Moderately downward** (1-2% impact on total volumes)

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**
- **Pre-shutdown momentum**: Nov 2025 record-breaking volumes, early Feb 2026 showing 13.5-21.1% YoY growth. However, shutdown fundamentally changes operational context.
  - Direction: **Upward baseline** but overridden by shutdown

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: Feb 23-Mar 1, 2026 (7 days), resolving Mar 2, 2026. Currently Feb 15, 2026—target week is 8-16 days away.

**Critical timing**: Government shutdown began Feb 14, 2026—it will be 9-15 days old during our target week. Historical precedent shows TSA staffing issues compound over time as unpaid workers call out sick.

**If timeframe halved (4-8 days out)**: Would increase confidence in shutdown impact assessment—clearer picture of TSA staffing levels and operational disruptions.

**If timeframe doubled (16-32 days out)**: Greater uncertainty about shutdown duration and resolution. Could see either normalization or severe degradation.

## (d) Justification

**Base rate starting point**: 16.405M (2025 actual) with observed early Feb 2026 YoY growth of 13.5-21.1%.

**Pre-shutdown expectation**: 16.4M × 1.15-1.18 = 18.9-19.4M

**Shutdown impact assessment**:
The government shutdown is the dominant factor. Expert consensus and historical precedent indicate:
- TSA agents working without pay increases call-out risk
- Longer security lines deter marginal travelers
- Airlines may reduce schedules anticipating disruptions
- Spring break season amplifies impact

**Quantifying shutdown impact**:
- Optimistic scenario: Minimal disruption, 5% volume reduction → 18.9M × 0.95 = 17.96M
- Moderate scenario: Noticeable disruption, 10% reduction → 18.9M × 0.90 = 17.01M
- Severe scenario: Significant disruption, 15% reduction → 18.9M × 0.85 = 16.07M

**Compounding factors**: Extended winter weather and REAL ID friction add 2-4% additional headwind.

**Net assessment**: The shutdown transforms this from a routine growth forecast into a crisis scenario. The 2025 baseline of 16.4M becomes more relevant as a floor than as a growth anchor.

Distribution calibration:

**Recalibrating from outside view**:

The outside view predicted 17.5M-20.0M (10th-90th percentile) assuming normal conditions with policy friction. The government shutdown fundamentally changes the scenario.

**New distribution logic**:
- **10th percentile (worst case)**: Severe shutdown impact, compounding weather/policy issues. Volume drops below 2025 baseline: **15,500,000**
- **30th percentile**: Moderate shutdown disruption, 10-12% below pre-shutdown expectation: **16,500,000**
- **50th percentile (median)**: Noticeable but manageable shutdown impact, 8% below expectation: **17,400,000**
- **70th percentile**: Minimal shutdown impact, slight growth over 2025: **18,000,000**
- **90th percentile (best case)**: Rapid shutdown resolution or minimal operational impact, near pre-shutdown expectation: **18,800,000**

**Key assumption**: The shutdown will cause measurable but not catastrophic disruption. TSA remains operational but degraded. Most travelers proceed but with friction.

Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Total TSA passenger screenings Feb 23-Mar 1, 2026 (7 days), measured in passengers.

2. **Base rate**: Outside view suggested 17.5M-20.0M (10th-90th). Adjusting downward due to government shutdown—a structural operational constraint not present in reference class.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 17.4M; mean ≈ 17.3M. Makes sense given 2025 baseline of 16.4M with shutdown suppressing expected growth. Aligned with moderate disruption scenario.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Government shutdown (Feb 14) with 50,000 TSA agents unpaid during target week (STRONG, factual, multiple sources)
   - Historical precedent: 2024 shutdown caused mass cancellations/delays (STRONG, factual)
   - Extended winter weather forecast for Northeast/Great Lakes (MODERATE, expert meteorologists)
   - Early 2026 YoY growth of 13.5-21.1% pre-shutdown (MODERATE, official data)
   - REAL ID fee friction affecting 6% of travelers (MODERATE, policy fact)

5. **Blind-spot**: Rapid shutdown resolution before Feb 23 would make forecast look pessimistic. Would push outcome UP toward 18.5-19.5M range.

6. **Status quo**: 2025 actual was 16.4M. Given 9-day-old shutdown during target week, expecting modest growth over 2025 (6%) rather than typical 15-18% growth. Moderate volatility situation.

7. **Technicalities**: Values in passengers, strictly increasing, within bounds (12M-17M stated, but extending to 18.8M as bounds are open).
