Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**TSA.gov travel/passenger-volumes (Feb 2026 data through Feb 12):**
High-quality primary source. Official government data showing daily volumes through Feb 12, 2026. Shows 8.9M passengers for Feb 9-12 (4 days). Factual, no opinions.

**Google Spreadsheet with TSA data:**
Secondary source compiling official TSA data. Shows Feb 1-8, 2026 with 7-day rolling averages of ~14.2-14.5M and YoY growth of 13.5-21.1%. Reliable replication of official data.

**TSA 2025 data archive:**
Primary source showing the comparable week (Feb 23-Mar 1, 2025) totaled **16,405,121 passengers**. This is our most critical baseline. Factual data.

**TSA holiday travel article (Dec 2025):**
Official TSA projection expecting 2025 to be "another record setter" with 44.3M travelers Dec 19-Jan 4. Shows sustained growth trend. Mix of fact (past records) and official projections.

**Collier County tourism article (Feb 11, 2026):**
Regional data showing 14.5% decline in international visitors Oct-Dec 2025, with 20.3% drop in Canadian visitors. Factual but limited geographic scope. Suggests headwinds for international travel.

**FlightBI February 2025 analysis:**
Industry analysis showing Feb 2025 volumes aligned with 2024, with business travel surpassing 2024 levels. Mix of data and industry opinion. Moderate reliability.

**Travel & Tour World REAL ID article:**
Reports new $45 fee starting Feb 1, 2026 for non-compliant travelers (~20M people, 6% of population). Could cause delays up to 30 minutes. Factual policy information with potential behavioral implications.

**Agent Report:**
Correctly identifies data gaps and methodology. Notes that 2026 data for Feb 23-Mar 1 is mostly future (only Feb 23-24-25 might be available by forecast opening). Accurate assessment.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**
1. Same week in 2025 (Feb 23-Mar 1, 2025): 16.405M passengers
2. Recent 7-day periods in Feb 2026: ~14.2-14.5M (rolling averages from early Feb)
3. YoY growth rates from 2024→2025: 13-21% range observed in early Feb 2026

**Most suitable reference class:** The exact same week in 2025 (16.405M) adjusted by observed 2026 YoY growth trends.

**Rationale:** This week has no major holidays (Presidents' Day was Feb 17, 2025/2026), making it a "normal" late-winter travel week. The 2025 baseline provides the most direct comparison.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** The question resolves Mar 2, 2026, covering Feb 23-Mar 1, 2026 (7 days). As of Feb 15, 2026, this is 8-16 days in the future.

**Historical patterns:**
- Feb 23-Mar 1, 2025: 16.405M (baseline)
- Early Feb 2026 shows YoY growth of 13.5-21.1% vs 2025
- 7-day rolling averages in early Feb 2026: 14.2-14.5M
- Post-pandemic trend: consistent double-digit YoY growth through 2025

**Seasonal context:** Late February is typically moderate travel season—past spring break peak, before Easter/summer surge. The week includes one weekend, typical weekday business travel.

## (d) Justification

**Base calculation:**
- 2025 baseline: 16,405,121 passengers
- Observed YoY growth in early Feb 2026: 13.5-21.1%
- Midpoint growth: ~17%
- Expected 2026 volume: 16.405M × 1.17 = **19.19M**

**Adjusting factors:**

*Upward pressures:*
- Sustained economic recovery and business travel resurgence
- TSA expecting 2025 to be "another record setter"
- Business travel in Feb 2025 "consistently surpassed 2024"

*Downward pressures:*
- New $45 REAL ID fee (Feb 1, 2026) affecting 6% of travelers—could suppress some discretionary travel
- International visitor decline (14.5% drop in sample region)
- Potential 30-minute delays from new ID verification
- Early Feb 2026 rolling averages (14.2-14.5M) suggest this specific week might be slightly lower than average

**Key uncertainty:** The REAL ID fee implementation is brand new (Feb 1, 2026) and its impact on behavior is unknown. However, 94% compliance means most travelers unaffected.

**Synthesis:** The 2025 baseline of 16.4M adjusted by 15-18% growth suggests 18.9-19.4M as the central range. However, given the new policy friction and that early Feb 2026 7-day periods show ~14.5M averages (which would be ~15-17% below a straight 17% growth projection), there's meaningful downside risk.

## Outside View Calibration

**Distribution considerations:**

1. **Central tendency:** 16.4M × 1.15 to 1.18 = 18.86M to 19.35M
2. **Established anchor:** 2025 actual = 16.405M provides firm lower bound context
3. **Observed variance:** Early Feb 2026 YoY growth ranges 13.5-21.1% (7.6 percentage point spread)
4. **Policy shock:** REAL ID fee is unprecedented—could suppress 2-5% of marginal travel
5. **Tail risks:** 
   - Downside: Economic shock, severe weather, policy impact worse than expected
   - Upside: Pent-up demand, stronger economy, minimal policy impact

**Calibration approach:**
- 10th percentile: Assume minimal growth (~8-10%) due to policy headwinds: 16.4M × 1.09 = 17.88M
- 50th percentile: Moderate growth (~15-16%): 16.4M × 1.155 = 18.95M
- 90th percentile: Strong growth matching high end of observed range (~20%): 16.4M × 1.20 = 19.69M

**Adjustments for uncertainty:**
- Widening 10th percentile down to 17.5M to account for compounded policy/weather risks
- Extending 90th percentile to 20.0M to capture possibility of stronger-than-observed growth
- This creates a ~2.5M range (14% spread), appropriate for 8-16 day forecast with new policy variable
