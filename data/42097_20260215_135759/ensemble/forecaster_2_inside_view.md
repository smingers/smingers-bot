Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**Historical TSA Data Sources:**
1. **TSA Checkpoint Travel Numbers** (official, through Feb 12, 2026): Primary source, high reliability, <1-day lag. Shows Feb 23-Mar 1, 2025 = 16,405,121 passengers.
2. **Google Sheet mirror** (dated Feb 9, 2026): Secondary compilation of TSA data, convenient but slightly dated.
3. **Early Feb 2026 TSA data**: Shows 7-day rolling average ~14.5M with YoY growth +13-21% in first 12 days of February.

**Recent News Articles (Feb 13-15, 2026):**
4. **Government Shutdown Coverage** (Multiple sources: AP, CNBC, Travel & Tour World, Boston Globe, Feb 14, 2026): FACTUAL - DHS shutdown began Feb 14, 2026. ~50,000 TSA agents (95% of workforce) working without pay. Key expert quote from John Rose (Altour Chief Risk Officer): warns of potential delays, longer lines, increased absences. Airlines for America, U.S. Travel Association, American Hotel & Lodging Association issued joint warning about disruption risks during spring break season.
   - **Critical distinction**: Unlike 2024's 43-day shutdown, FAA air traffic controllers remain FUNDED through Sept 2026, reducing flight cancellation risk.
   - **Quality**: High - multiple independent sources, named experts, official industry statements.

5. **Weather Forecasts** (Outside Online, Feb 2, 2026; silive, Jan 28, 2026): AccuWeather meteorologists (Paul Pastelok, Chad Merrill) predict extended winter conditions through March in Northeast, Great Lakes, Pacific Northwest. Late-season snow and frost expected.
   - **Quality**: Moderate - named meteorological experts, but weather forecasts 2+ weeks out have limited reliability.

6. **Canadian-U.S. Travel** (Time Out Montreal, Feb 13, 2026): Air Transat canceling all U.S. flights starting June 2026; Canadian travel to U.S. at "record lows" in early 2026.
   - **Quality**: Moderate - specific airline decisions factual, but impact on Feb 23-Mar 1 period limited since cancellations start June.

7. **China Spring Festival Travel** (Multiple Chinese sources, Jan-Feb 2026): China expecting 95M civil aviation passengers during their Spring Festival season (Feb 2-Mar 13, 2026).
   - **Quality**: High for China context, but IRRELEVANT to U.S. TSA volumes.

8. **Post-Thanksgiving 2025 Record** (Benzinga, Dec 2, 2025): TSA recorded 3,133,924 passengers on Nov 30, 2025 - new single-day record.
   - **Quality**: High factual reliability, but dated (3+ months old).

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**STRONG EVIDENCE (Large impact):**
- **Government shutdown forcing unpaid TSA work** (Feb 14-ongoing): Multiple independent sources confirm 50,000 TSA agents working without pay starting Feb 14. Historical precedent from 2024 shutdown showed increased call-outs and delays. However, FAA controllers remain paid (unlike 2024), limiting flight cancellation risk.
  - **Direction**: DOWNWARD pressure on volumes (longer lines → missed flights, deterred travelers)
  - **Magnitude**: Potentially -3% to -8% if significant TSA absences occur

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**
- **Extended winter weather forecast**: Named meteorologists predict continued cold/snow in Northeast, Great Lakes through March. Feb 23-Mar 1 period falls in this window.
  - **Direction**: DOWNWARD (weather disruptions reduce travel)
  - **Magnitude**: -1% to -3%

- **Current YoY growth momentum**: First 12 days of Feb 2026 show +13-21% YoY growth vs 2025, with 7-day rolling average at 14.5M.
  - **Direction**: UPWARD (strong underlying demand)
  - **Magnitude**: +10-15% vs 2025 baseline

- **Seasonal ramp-up**: Week 8 (Feb 23-Mar 1) historically runs 12-15% above early February weeks due to spring break preparation.
  - **Direction**: UPWARD
  - **Magnitude**: Built into baseline expectation

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**
- Canadian travel weakness: Relevant but small portion of total TSA volumes
- Real-ID fee: 94% already compliant, minimal impact

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

**Prediction window**: 8 days until start (Feb 23), 15 days until resolution (Mar 2).

The **government shutdown** is the critical new factor. It began Feb 14, meaning TSA agents will have worked 9-16 days without pay during the target week. Historical pattern from 2024 shutdown: disruptions emerged gradually over 2-3 weeks as financial strain mounted.

**If timeframe were halved** (4 days out): Shutdown impact would be more certain; current TSA staffing levels would be observable.

**If timeframe were doubled** (30 days out): Shutdown could be resolved OR significantly worsened; weather patterns would be more speculative.

**(d) Justification**

**Base rate**: Feb 23-Mar 1, 2025 = 16,405,121 passengers

**Adjustments from outside view:**

1. **Underlying growth trend** (+14% YoY observed Jan-early Feb 2026): +2.30M
2. **Government shutdown drag** (NEW factor, not in outside view): The shutdown creates significant downside risk. While FAA controllers are paid (reducing cancellations), TSA agent absences could create bottlenecks. Industry groups explicitly warned of "longer wait times, missed flights." Conservative estimate: -1.5M to -2.5M
3. **Weather disruption risk** (extended winter): -0.3M to -0.6M
4. **Seasonal deceleration uncertainty**: -0.5M

**Net adjustment**: +2.3M (growth) -2.0M (shutdown) -0.4M (weather) -0.5M (deceleration) = -0.6M

**Revised point estimate**: 16.4M - 0.6M = 15.8M

However, the shutdown introduces HIGH UNCERTAINTY. Best case: minimal TSA absences, volumes near 17.5M. Worst case: significant disruptions, volumes drop to 14.5M.

Distribution calibration:

The government shutdown fundamentally increases downside risk and overall uncertainty compared to the outside view. I'm shifting the distribution:

- **Median down** from 17.7M to 16.0M (reflecting shutdown drag)
- **Wider spread** (σ from 1.2M to 1.5M) due to shutdown unpredictability
- **Negative skew** (fatter left tail) because shutdown can cause cascading failures

**Calibrated percentiles:**
- 10th: 13.5M (severe shutdown disruptions + weather)
- 20th: 14.5M (moderate shutdown impact)
- 40th: 15.5M (mild shutdown impact, below-trend growth)
- 60th: 16.5M (shutdown contained, near-baseline)
- 80th: 17.5M (shutdown minimal, strong growth continues)
- 90th: 18.5M (optimistic case: shutdown resolved quickly, peak spring break surge)

Checklist:

1. **Target**: Total TSA checkpoint passengers screened Feb 23-Mar 1, 2026 (7 days), in passenger units. ✓

2. **Base rate**: Outside view centered at 17.7M; I'm shifting down to 16.0M median due to government shutdown. Justified because shutdown is a structural disruption not present in historical reference class. ✓

3. **Consistency**: Implied median = 16.0M; mean ≈ 16.2M (slight right skew from bounded downside). Aligns with "shutdown creates drag but underlying demand remains strong." ✓

4. **Key evidence**:
   - 50,000 TSA agents working without pay since Feb 14 (FACTUAL, multiple sources)
   - Industry groups warned of disruption risk during spring break (FACTUAL, joint statement)
   - FAA controllers remain paid, limiting cancellation risk (FACTUAL, distinguishes from 2024)
   - YoY growth +13-21% in early Feb 2026 (FACTUAL, TSA data)
   - Extended winter weather forecast for Northeast (EXPERT OPINION, AccuWeather)

5. **Blind spot**: Shutdown resolved quickly (e.g., emergency funding passed Feb 20-22) → TSA morale improves, minimal absences → outcome pushes UP toward 17.5-18M.

6. **Status quo**: Last year same week = 16.4M. My median of 16.0M is slightly below, reflecting shutdown drag offsetting growth trend. Reasonable given high uncertainty. ✓

7. **Technicalities**: Values strictly increasing, in passenger units, within bounds [12M, 17M] but extending to 18.5M at 90th percentile (question allows exceeding upper bound). ✓
