Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**TSA.gov (Current 2026 data)**: Official government source showing daily passenger volumes through Feb 12, 2026. High reliability. Shows recent daily volumes ranging 1.67-2.70 million passengers. This is the gold standard for historical data.

**Google Sheets (TSA Weekly Volumes)**: Community-maintained compilation of TSA data through Feb 8, 2026. Shows 7-day rolling averages around 14.2-14.5 million with YoY growth of 13.53%-21.14% in early February 2026. Reliable as it mirrors official TSA data.

**TSA 2025 Archive**: Official data showing Feb 23-Mar 1, 2025 totaled **16,405,121 passengers**. This is the most directly relevant historical comparison for our target week.

**WRNJRADIO (Dec 22, 2025)**: Reports TSA expecting 2025 to be "another record setter" with 2.86 million passengers expected on Dec 28, 2025. Factual reporting of TSA projections. Indicates continued strong growth trend into late 2025.

**FlightBI (March 11, 2025)**: Analysis piece showing February 2025 volumes closely aligned with 2024, with projections for continued growth. Mix of data and opinion from aviation analytics firm. Notes business travel surpassing 2024 levels.

**Naples News (Feb 11, 2026)**: Reports 14.5% decline in international visitors to Collier County (Oct-Dec 2025), with 20.3% drop in Canadian visitors. This is factual local data that may signal broader international travel weakness, though it's regional and doesn't directly address TSA volumes.

**Travel & Tour World (Feb 2026)**: Reports new $45 TSA fee for non-REAL ID travelers starting Feb 1, 2026, affecting ~20 million people (6% of population). Could add 30-minute delays. This is a factual policy change that may create friction, though the article doesn't cite official TSA sources directly.

**Agent Report**: Correctly identifies data gaps and methodology. Notes that 2026 data for Feb 23-Mar 1 is partially future (only Feb 23 would be available by Feb 24, 2026; the rest occurs after our analysis date of Feb 15, 2026).

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **Same week in previous years (Feb 23-Mar 1)**: Most direct comparison. We have 2025 data showing 16.405 million passengers.
2. **Early February 2026 weeks**: Shows 7-day averages of 14.2-14.5 million with 13-21% YoY growth.
3. **Post-pandemic growth trajectory**: Consistent double-digit YoY growth since 2020.

**Most suitable**: Same week previous year (2025: 16.405M) adjusted for 2026 growth trends observed in early February (~15-18% YoY growth appears sustainable based on recent data).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 8-16 days from now (Feb 15, 2026 to Feb 23-Mar 1, 2026).

**Historical patterns:**
- Feb 23-Mar 1, 2025: 16,405,121 passengers
- Early Feb 2026 shows YoY growth of 13.53%-21.14%
- 7-day rolling averages in early Feb 2026: 14.2-14.5 million
- Late February typically shows mid-week strength with weekend dips

**Seasonal factors**: Late February is post-Presidents' Day, pre-Spring Break - typically moderate travel period. Not a major holiday week.

## (d) Justification

The baseline is Feb 23-Mar 1, 2025: **16,405,121 passengers**.

**Upward pressures:**
- Early Feb 2026 shows robust 15-18% YoY growth (median of observed range)
- Business travel recovering strongly per FlightBI
- 2025 was described as "record setter" suggesting momentum
- Economic indicators supporting travel demand

**Downward pressures:**
- New $45 REAL ID fee (Feb 1, 2026) affecting 6% of travelers could create friction
- International travel showing weakness (Naples data, though regional)
- Potential 30-minute delays from new ID requirements may discourage some travel
- Early Feb 2026 7-day averages (14.2-14.5M) are actually BELOW the 2025 comparable week (16.4M), suggesting growth may be moderating

**Central estimate**: Applying 15% YoY growth to 2025 baseline: 16,405,121 × 1.15 = **18,865,889**

However, the early Feb 2026 rolling averages being lower than the 2025 comparable week suggests more modest growth. A more conservative 10-12% growth seems prudent: 16,405,121 × 1.11 = **18,209,684**

Given uncertainties around the REAL ID impact and mixed signals, I'll center around **17.5-18.0 million** with meaningful uncertainty bands.

## Outside View Calibration

**Distribution considerations:**
- Historical baseline: 16.4M (2025)
- Early 2026 suggests 10-15% growth is reasonable
- REAL ID friction is a new factor with uncertain magnitude
- Question bounds (12-17M) seem too narrow given 2025 was 16.4M and growth is expected

**Tail considerations:**
- 10th percentile: Significant disruption from REAL ID or unexpected event → ~8% growth = 17.7M
- 90th percentile: Strong continued momentum, minimal REAL ID impact → ~18% growth = 19.4M
- Must account for "unknown unknowns" - weather events, system disruptions, etc.

**Rate of upsets**: TSA volumes are relatively stable week-to-week absent major disruptions. However, new policy implementations (REAL ID) introduce uncertainty. I'll set moderately wide intervals.
