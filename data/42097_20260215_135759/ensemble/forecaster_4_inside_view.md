Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. TSA daily passenger-volume page (tsa.gov, updated through 14 Feb 2026).  Primary administrative data – highest quality, factual.  Shows 7-day totals 3–9 Feb 2026 ≈14.3 M (+14-21 % YoY).  
2. Public Google sheet that mirrors TSA numbers (secondary, but consistent with TSA). Confirms same 14.2–14.5 M early-Feb reading.  
3. TSA archived table for 2025.  Gives exact comparator week 23 Feb–1 Mar 2025 = 16 405 121 passengers.  Primary, factual.  
4. Cluster of 13–14 Feb 2026 news items (AP, CNBC, Boston Globe, etc.) on the DHS shutdown forcing 50 000 TSA officers to work unpaid.  Identifiable reporters quoting DHS contingency plan.  Moderate-quality, factual about staffing risk; opinions from travel-industry groups.  
5. AccuWeather/Outside & silive winter‐weather outlooks (early Feb 2026).  Identifiable meteorologists; moderate quality.  Relevant for potential storm-related cancellations.  
6. TimeOut Montreal article on Canadian carriers cutting US flights (13 Feb 2026).  Niche, factual but only indirectly relevant (trans-border share <5 % of TSA counts).  
7. Misc. Chinese Spring-Festival aviation pieces – unrelated to US TSA, ignored.

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong:  
• TSA actual 3–9 Feb 2026 total 14.3 M establishes live demand level.  
• TSA exact week total in 2025 (16.41 M) anchors seasonality baseline.  
Moderate:  
• Government shutdown—historical 2018-19 data show call-outs reduced throughput 2-4 % within 2–3 weeks.  
• Long-range forecasts of continued winter storms in NE & Midwest raise cancellation risk 1-3 %.  
Weak:  
• Canadian carrier cuts, REAL-ID fee stories – marginal impact (<0.5 %).  
• International visitor softness anecdotes.

(c) Timeframe  
Target window begins in 8 days, ends in 15 days.  If the horizon were halved (prediction due tomorrow) there would be very little new information to move the median; if doubled (a month out) I would widen 10th/90th by ~0.5 M each side for additional weather/ labour uncertainty.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Step 1 – Outside view anchor: 23 Feb–1 Mar 2025 = 16.41 M.  
Step 2 – Trend growth: early-Feb 2026 running +14 % YoY; however, the same week last year was already well above early-Feb.  I infer underlying 2026/2025 growth for THIS week roughly +5 %.  16.41 M × 1.05 ≈ 17.2 M.  
Step 3 – Down-adjust for likely disruptions:  
• DHS shutdown absenteeism (airport lines, some missed flights) −2 %.  
• Elevated winter-storm odds −1 %.  
Net factor 0.97 → central estimate 16.7 M.  
Step 4 – Uncertainty: historical week-to-week shocks can swing totals ±8-10 %.  I set 10th–90th span ≈3.7 M around the median.

Distribution calibration
Median (≈60th pct) 17.0 M; mean slightly lower (≈16.9 M) because left tail longer.  Tails chosen to allow heavy weather or surprisingly robust demand.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: total TSA-screened passengers Mon 23 Feb–Sun 1 Mar 2026, units = passengers.  
2. Outside-view distribution rooted in 2025 =16.41 M.  
3. Consistency: implied median 17.0 M, mean 16.9 M – coherent with +2 % net growth narrative.  
4. Key evidence: a) 2025 week total 16.41 M; b) 3–9 Feb 2026 actual 14.3 M; c) +14 % YoY early-Feb trend; d) DHS shutdown causing unpaid TSA staff; e) forecast winter storms.  
5. Blind-spot: Congress instantly ends shutdown, demand + benign weather → >18.5 M.  (Would push outcome up.)  
6. Status-quo (no growth) would be 16.4 M – close to my 40th percentile.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, units = passengers, inside stated open bounds.
