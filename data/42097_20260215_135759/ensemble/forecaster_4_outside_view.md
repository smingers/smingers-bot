Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. TSA “Checkpoint Travel Numbers” tables (2019-2026). Primary, official, daily counts; continuously revised. High factual reliability, negligible publication lag (≤ 1 day).  
2. Google Sheet that mirrors the TSA tables. Secondary, but a convenient single file. Factual, dated 9 Feb 2026.  
3. TSA 2025 table excerpt (Metaculus summary). Gives the exact total for the week 23 Feb-1 Mar 2025 (16 ,405 ,121). High quality: same underlying TSA data.  
4. Early-Feb-2026 TSA data (Metaculus summary of Google Sheet). Shows 7-day rolling average ≈ 14.5 M and day-to-day YoY growth of +13 – 21 %.  
5. Travel-and-Tour-World article on the new $45 “Confirm ID” fee (11 Feb 2026). Credible fact-based policy report, but its behavioural impact is speculative; 94 % of flyers already compliant, so the implied volume drag is limited (< 2 %).  
6. Naples Daily News piece on weaker inbound international tourism (11 Feb 2026). Regional, small sample; relevant only insofar as international travellers are ≈ 12 % of TSA throughput and may be soft.  
7. Agent report (internal). Clarifies where to fetch the raw numbers; no new quantitative data.

Factual information for modelling therefore comes almost entirely from (1)–(4); (5)–(6) are possible—but weak—demand head-winds.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Two obvious classes were considered:  
1. “Same calendar week in 2019-2025” (captures seasonality and trend).  
2. “Immediate preceding weeks of 2026” (captures very fresh level information).  
Class 1 alone over-estimates because volumes rose sharply between 2019 and 2025; class 2 alone under-estimates because late-February is typically 12-15 % busier than early February (spring-break ramp-up).  
A blended reference class—“same week last year” scaled by the current 2026/2025 YoY growth seen so far and cross-checked against the current 7-day rolling average—best balances seasonality and the most recent growth signal.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window opens in 8 days and closes in 15 days; the indicator is reported with ≤ 1-day lag.  
Historical weekly totals for the target week:  
• 2019 : 14.33 M • 2020 : 15.07 M • 2021 : 10.08 M  
• 2022 : 13.14 M • 2023 : 14.96 M • 2024 : 15.06 M (est.)  
• 2025 : 16.41 M   (official)  
Compound growth 2022→2025 = +8.0 % p.a. The first 12 days of Feb 2026 show YoY +17 % versus 2025, but that is inflated by an unusually weak comparable in 2025; smoothing across Jan-early-Feb gives +14 %.  

Seasonality: Week 8 (counting from 1 Jan) typically runs 12–15 % above weeks 5-6 (where our most recent data sit). Today’s rolling 7-day total is 14.5 M; applying a +13 % seasonal lift would imply 16.4 M even with zero YoY growth.  

(d) Justification  
Base rate (outside view) = last year’s realised figure 16.41 M.  
Adjustments:  
• Activity trend: +14 % YoY seen YTD → +2.30 M  
• Uncertainty that growth decelerates in late Feb (observed in 2024-25) → -0.80 M  
• Possible drag from Real-ID fee & softer international segment (small) → -0.25 M  
Point estimate ≈ 16.41 + 1.25 = 17.66 M.

Spread considerations  
Historical week-on-week surprises (2019-25) have a σ ≈ 0.7 M (≈ 4 %).  
Extra uncertainty for a one-week-ahead forecast (weather shocks, data revisions, policy friction) ⇒ inflate σ to 1.2 M (≈ 7 %).  
Assume an approximately normal core, but fatten tails 1.5× beyond ±2 σ to cover “unknown-unknowns” such as a major winter storm or a systemic IT outage.

Outside view calibration:
Mean (μ) ≈ 17.7 M  
Central σ ≈ 1.2 M  
10th ≈ μ − 1.6 σ ≈ 15.8 M  
20th ≈ μ − 1.2 σ ≈ 16.3 M  
40th ≈ μ − 0.4 σ ≈ 17.2 M  
60th ≈ μ + 0.4 σ ≈ 18.2 M  
80th ≈ μ + 1.1 σ ≈ 19.0 M  
90th ≈ μ + 1.6 σ ≈ 19.6 M  

These bounds are intentionally wider than pure historical volatility to remain well-calibrated; they admit roughly a 1-in-10 chance of an outlier week below 16 M (large disruption) or above 19.5 M (runaway spring-break surge).
