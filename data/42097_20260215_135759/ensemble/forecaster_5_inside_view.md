Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
• TSA daily checkpoint table (downloaded 14 Feb 2026). Official, high-quality, covers 2019-2026. Shows YoY growth of +13 % to +21 % for 10-12 Feb 2026. (Facts)  
• Google-sheet mirror of the same data (updated 8 Feb 2026). Convenient but redundant. (Facts)  
• ABC News 2025 article on record summer days. Historical context for long-run growth, reliable mainstream outlet. (Facts + expert opinion)  
• OutsideOnline & SIlive winter-weather pieces (2 Feb & 28 Jan 2026). Identifiable meteorologists; signal possible late-Feb snow in Northeast/Great Lakes. (Forecast opinion)  
• Cluster of AP, CNBC, Boston Globe, Economic Times etc. (13-14 Feb 2026) on DHS partial shutdown. All quote DHS contingency plan and trade-group warnings. Multiple independent confirmations. (Facts)  
• Travel-and-Tour-World/SimpleFlying derivatives of the above—lower editorial standards, used only for colour.  

b) Evidence weighting  
Strong:  
– Outside TSA time series: clear historical pattern; identical numbers across sources.  
Moderate:  
– Shutdown has direct causal path to longer lines; multiple mainstream outlets concur; historical 2018-19 & 2024 shutdowns give precedent, but impact on throughput was modest.  
– AccuWeather long-range forecast of snow/ice in NE & Great Lakes: single professional source, plausible but weather uncertainty high.  
Weak:  
– Articles on Canada-US airline reductions (takes effect June 2026, outside window).  

c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome known 15-16 days from today; forecast window begins in 8 days. If window were halved (i.e., period started tomorrow) I would raise the mean ~0.2 M because shutdown/ weather risks would have even less time to bite. If doubled, extra week would widen tails ±0.3 M.  

d) Justification of inside-view shift  
Outside-view centre = previous-year week total 16.405 M.  
Add structural growth: average 2025/26 YoY trend = +15 % so far in February.  
Subtract expected friction:  
• Partial shutdown (TSA unpaid) – based on 2019 & 2024 episodes, assume 2 % loss of throughput if no funding deal by then.  
• Weather disruption – late-winter storms historically cut 0-4 % of daily volume once every 3-4 years; assign 1 % mean hit.  
Net adjustment = +12 % → central estimate 18.4 M.  
Tails widened for (a) severe staffing walk-outs or blizzard (down to −11 % YoY, 14.6 M) and (b) continued 18-20 % growth with minimal disruption (up to +26 % YoY, 20.7 M).  

Distribution calibration
Mean ≈ 18.3 M, median 18.0 M. St.dev (implicit) ≈ 1.4 M. Percentiles below follow a near-log-normal shape and preserve the outside-view anchor while incorporating current risks.

Checklist:
1. Target: total TSA passengers screened Mon 23 Feb 2026 – Sun 1 Mar 2026, inclusive, in persons.  
2. Base-rate distribution stated above; final distribution still centres on it.  
3. Implied median ≈ 18.0 M; mean ≈ 18.3 M; consistent with +12 % YoY and rationale.  
4. Key factors: (i) 15 % YoY growth visible 10-12 Feb TSA data; (ii) DHS shutdown leaving TSA unpaid; (iii) forecast late-Feb snow NE/GL; (iv) 2019/2024 shutdown impact history.  
5. Blind-spot: two-day nationwide blizzard plus mass TSA sick-out shuts several hubs – would push total below 14 M.  
6. Status-quo (steady trend) yields ~18.8 M; I nudged slightly lower for disruption risk.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units = passengers; all lie within the open bounds.
