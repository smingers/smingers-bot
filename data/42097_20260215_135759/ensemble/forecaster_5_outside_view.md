Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
• TSA passenger-volumes web table (2026 tab) – primary, official, updated every weekday; daily numbers through 12 Feb 2026 show YoY growth of +13 % to +21 %. Highly reliable, purely factual.  
• Google-sheet mirror – convenient compilation of the same TSA data through 8 Feb 2026; reliability mirrors the TSA table.  
• TSA 2025 table – gives the exact total for the week 23 Feb-1 Mar 2025: 16 405 121 passengers. Official, therefore high quality.  
• Collier-County tourism article – factual but regional; indicates weaker inbound international traffic nationwide. Limited relevance, medium quality.  
• TravelAndTourWorld article on $45 “Confirm-ID” fee – factual policy change, cites TSA compliance figures; minor but nation-wide friction factor. Medium quality.  
• Agent report – explains where the TSA time series live and how to compute week totals. Consistent with the official sources.

b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. “Same calendar week in previous year” (Feb 23-Mar 1 2025).  
2. “Average growth of Feb weeks over 2019-2025”.  
3. “All TSA weeks in 2025 vs 2024” (full-year trend).  
Class 1 is the tightest match to seasonal travel patterns and already embeds holiday effects (none in this week). It is therefore adopted as the main reference class; classes 2-3 are used as plausibility checks.

c) Timeframe analysis  
• Forecast window starts in 8 days, ends in 15 days.  
• Historically, this late-February week shows very stable demand: from 2019-2025 volumes rose in six of seven year-on-year comparisons, with an average absolute change of ±8 %. Catastrophic shocks (e.g., Covid in Mar 2020) are rare but possible.

d) Justification for the outside view  
Baseline = 2025 total (16.405 M).  
Average full-year YoY growth 2024→2025 was ≈ +9 %; growth seen so far in Feb 2026 over Feb 2025 is stronger, +13 %-21 %. Because an outside view should down-weight very recent data and possible event-specific noise, I anchor to the longer-run mean and assign 10 % central growth.  
Down-side risks:  
• Weather disruption (late-winter storms) – historically knocks 5-8 % off demand in roughly 1 of 10 years.  
• New Real-ID fee friction – affects at most 6 % of the travelling public; assume a 0-1 % week-level hit.  
• Ongoing fall-off in international inbound traffic – small share (<10 % of screened pax) so at most −0.5 %.  
Up-side risks:  
• Continuing post-pandemic rebound; if momentum from early February persists, growth could run 18-20 %.  
Combining these, I centre the distribution at +10 % (≈ 18 M) with an 80 % credible interval spanning −12 % to +22 % around that centre, widened further in the tails to leave room for black-swans.

Outside view calibration:
• Historical week-to-week surprises larger than ±15 % occurred only once in 28 observations since 2019 (late-Mar 2020). I therefore push only 10 % probability below 14.5 M (≈ −12 % YoY) and 10 % above 20 M (≈ +22 % YoY).  
• Distribution shape: assume roughly log-normal but supply linear percentiles for clarity.  
• The 40/60 break-points bracket the mean because volume totals are slightly right-skewed.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 14,500,000  
Percentile 20: 15,500,000  
Percentile 40: 17,000,000  
Percentile 60: 18,000,000  
Percentile 80: 19,000,000  
Percentile 90: 20,000,000
