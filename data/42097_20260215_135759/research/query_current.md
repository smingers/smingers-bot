Analysis:
To estimate the total number of passengers TSA will screen from Feb 23 – Mar 1 2026, I need:

1. Recent daily TSA throughput data (Feb 2025 and Feb 2024) to establish seasonality and a YoY trend baseline.
2. The most up-to-date 2026 numbers (Feb 1-14 already published) to gauge current year growth versus 2025.
3. Industry outlook pieces (airlines, TSA, FAA, trade groups) describing demand expectations for late-winter 2026—e.g., whether “revenge travel” momentum is still strong, whether capacity constraints or economic slowdown are emerging.
4. Commentary on any special events that might spike travel in late February 2026 (e.g., school breaks, major conferences, sports tournaments).

The three queries below target:
• Google → historical TSA spreadsheet pages or archived daily numbers.
• Google News → very recent articles/analyst notes on spring-2026 U.S. air-travel demand.
• AskNews → a synthesized answer drawing on multiple sources of TSA throughput data and forecasts.

Search queries:
1. TSA checkpoint numbers February 2025 (Google)
2. Spring 2026 air travel forecast (Google News)
3. Show TSA passenger volumes for February weeks 2024-2026 and any forecasts for late February 2026 U.S. air travel. (AskNews)
