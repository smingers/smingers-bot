Analysis:
To produce an outside-view forecast I need comparable historical passenger counts for:
1. The same Feb 23–Mar 1 week in previous years (2023-2025) to gauge seasonality.
2. The most recent daily TSA numbers (Jan–Feb 2026) to see this year’s growth trend vs. 2025.
3. News or commentary that might explain any unusual surges or slowdowns (e.g., fare wars, weather, new variants).

Useful sources:
• The TSA “Throughput” page, which lists every day back to 2019.
• Archived spreadsheets or GitHub mirrors that aggregate TSA data.
• Recent news stories summarizing record travel days.
