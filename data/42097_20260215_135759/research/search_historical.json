The article focuses on technology trends and predictions for the aviation industry in 2022, not passenger volume data or forecasts.\n\n## Key Content\n\nThe article discusses 10 technology trends predicted to shape the air transport industry in 2022, with emphasis on improving passenger experience and supporting post-COVID-19 recovery. The extracted content covers four main trends:\n\n1. **Metaverse and Virtual Reality**: Discussion of how immersive VR/AR experiences could be used for travel inspiration, cabin previews, training, and collaboration. Examples include Emirates' 3D cabin views and KLM's VR collaboration platform.\n\n2. **Experiential Retail at Airports**: Focus on using VR/AR technology in airport retail. Example cited: Heathrow Airport's partnership with Chanel featuring AR screens for virtual product try-ons.\n\n3. **E-commerce and Super Apps**: Airlines diversifying revenue streams through digital platforms. Examples include:\n   - Air Asia aiming for 50% of revenue from non-aviation sources by 2024\n   - Singapore Airlines launching Pelago e-commerce platform\n   - JetBlue's Paisly travel website\n   - Airports like Toronto Pearson and JFK launching digital marketplaces\n\n4. **Urban Air Mobility**: Investment trends in eVTOL aircraft, with partnerships between airlines (United, American, Virgin Atlantic) and aviation startups, plus airport infrastructure development for the 2024 Paris Olympics.\n\n**Note:** The article content appears to be truncated and does not contain passenger volume statistics or forecasts relevant to the question.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/tsa-rolls-out-45-fee-for-travelers-without-real-id-starting-february-2026-passengers-face-lengthy-waits-and-limited-payment-methods-at-security-heres-what-you-need-to-know/\">\n# Summary of Article: TSA $45 Fee for Travelers Without Real ID (February 2026)\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **New Fee Implementation**: Starting February 1, 2026, TSA will charge a $45 fee for travelers without valid Real ID, enhanced driver's license, or passport\n\n2. **Fee Coverage**: The $45 fee covers use of TSA's alternative identity verification system called \"Confirm.ID\" and is valid for 10 days of travel. Travelers exceeding this timeframe must pay again for return journeys.\n\n3. **Affected Population**: Approximately 20 million people in the United States have not yet updated their identification to meet enhanced security standards (about 6% of the U.S. population, as 94% are currently compliant)\n\n4. **Payment Methods**: Cash will NOT be accepted at security checkpoints. Only digital payments accepted: bank account, credit/debit cards, Venmo, or PayPal\n\n5. **Expected Delays**: The additional verification process could increase wait times by up to 30 minutes for passengers without acceptable ID\n\n## Potential Impact on Passenger Volume:\n\nWhile the article does not provide specific predictions about passenger volume changes, it describes a policy that could:\n- Create additional friction for approximately 20 million non-compliant travelers\n- Cause longer wait times at security checkpoints\n- Add financial costs for unprepared travelers\n\n## Source Reliability Note:\n\nThis article is from \"Travel And Tour World\" and presents factual information about TSA policy changes. However, it does not cite specific TSA press releases or official government sources directly, though it references TSA compliance statistics (94% compliance rate).\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve TSA daily passenger volumes Feb 23-Mar 1 for years 2019-2026 and summarize YoY growth\n1. What we have located so far  \n\u2022 TSA checkpoint-throughput data are published in two places that together cover every day back to 2019:  \n\u2003a. The public web table \u201cTSA checkpoint travel numbers\u201d (tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes). Each calendar-year tab (2019, 2020, \u2026 2026) can be opened from the menu on the left side of that page. This table is updated each weekday and already shows 2026 daily volumes through 12 Feb 2026 (Source 7).  \n\u2003b. A weekly PDF spreadsheet (\u201cPassenger Throughput\u201d) released to the FOIA Electronic Reading Room; those files are automatically harvested on data.gov under the dataset title \u201cCOVID-19 Passenger Throughput\u201d (Source 5 under \u201cData.gov \u2013 COVID-19 Passenger Throughput\u201d). The CSV that accompanies each weekly PDF contains the SAME national total that appears in the public web table, but extends the historical record back to 2019 and is easier to analyse programmatically.\n\n\u2022 None of the search snippets supplied above include the exact week that the question asks us to summarise (23 Feb \u2013 1 Mar of each year). We therefore do not yet have the actual daily values for:\n\u2003\u2013 23 Feb 2019 through 1 Mar 2019  \n\u2003\u2013 23 Feb 2020 through 1 Mar 2020  \n\u2003\u2013 \u2026  \n\u2003\u2013 23 Feb 2025 through 1 Mar 2025  \n\u2003\u2013 23 Feb 2026 through 1 Mar 2026 (future dates: only the first three of those days are now visible \u2014 23 Feb 2026 will not be posted until 24 Feb 2026 US-ET).\n\n\u2022 A public Google Sheet maintained by an aviation-data hobbyist (link in the Metaculus prompt) replicates the tsa.gov table and already contains separate tabs for 2019-2025. That sheet is a convenient single-file source but still requires us to look up (or programmatically pull) rows for 23 Feb\u20131 Mar of every year. The sheet does not yet have any rows for 2026 because the contributor only adds a year once 1 Jan of that year has passed; we know from tsa.gov that those data exist.\n\n2. Requirements of the original task and what is still missing  \nThe task is strictly empirical: \u201cRetrieve TSA daily passenger volumes 23 Feb\u20131 Mar for years 2019-2026 and summarise year-on-year (YoY) growth.\u201d  \nTo fulfil it we must deliver a table like:\n\n\u2003Date range\u2003\u20032019\u20032020\u20032021\u20032022\u20032023\u20032024\u20032025\u20032026*  \n\u2003Total pax\u2003\u2003x\u2003\u2003x\u2003\u2003x\u2003\u2003x\u2003\u2003x\u2003\u2003x\u2003\u2003x\u2003\u2003x  \n\u2003% YoY\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2013\u2003\u2003y/y% \u2026 etc.\n\n(*) 2026 is partially known today; the last four days of that week will only be posted after they occur.\n\nThe data still needed: the 56 individual daily numbers (8 years \u00d7 7 days) from tsa.gov (or the FOIA CSV) for 23 Feb through 1 Mar. We currently possess none of those 56 figures in the material already surfaced.\n\n3. Recommended next retrieval step  \nA single pull of the \u201cCOVID-19 Passenger Throughput\u201d CSV from data.gov will give every daily total from 1 Jan 2019 forward in one file. Filtering that file for the eight 7-day windows delivers the exact numbers we need. (If scripting is not possible, manually open the 2019, 2020, \u2026, 2026 tabs of tsa.gov and copy the seven rows per year.)\n\n4. After the numbers are collected, YoY growth is straightforward:  \n\u2003Weekly_Total(year) \u00f7 Weekly_Total(year-1) \u2212 1.  \nExample of the calculation method (using dummy numbers): if 23 Feb\u20131 Mar 2023 summed to 15.2 million pax and the same week in 2022 summed to 12.9 million, YoY = (15.2/12.9 \u2212 1) = +17.8 %.\n\n5. Remaining gap  \n\u2014 The raw passenger-throughput figures for those specific dates. Until they are pulled, neither the totals nor the YoY rates can be produced.  \n\u2014 Four of the seven daily values for the 2026 week are not yet published because they lie in the future (as of 15 Feb 2026). The final 2026 total and its YoY comparison with 2025 can therefore only be completed on 2 Mar 2026.\n\n6. New search queries that will close the gap  \n1. TSA passenger volumes Feb 23 2023 (Google)  \n2. TSA passenger volumes Feb 25 2020 (Google)  \n3. data.gov COVID 19 passenger throughput csv (Google)  \n\nRunning query 3, downloading the CSV and filtering by date will satisfy the entire data need; queries 1 and 2 serve as spot-checks against the CSV.</Agent_report>\n"
