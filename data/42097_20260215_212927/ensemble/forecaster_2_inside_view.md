Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:
1. Government Shutdown Articles (Travel and Tour World, Feb 14-15, 2026):
- Quality: High (multiple sources reporting)
- Key Facts: TSA workers working without pay, potential travel disruptions
- Potential Impact: Increased airport wait times, possible reduced staffing
- Reliability: High due to multiple consistent sources

2. Flight BI Article (January 2026):
- Quality: Medium
- Key Facts: January 2026 passenger traffic 45.4 million
- Insights: Slight month-over-month decline in passenger numbers
- Reliability: Moderate, provides recent historical context

3. TSA Checkpoint Travel Numbers:
- Quality: High (official source)
- Key Facts: Daily passenger numbers ranging 1.3-2.8 million
- Limitations: Data only until February 12, 2026

(b) Evidence Analysis:
Strong Evidence:
- Government shutdown potentially disrupting air travel
- Historical precedent of shutdown impacts on TSA operations
- Consistent daily passenger screening volumes around 2-2.7 million

Moderate Evidence:
- Slight decline in monthly passenger traffic
- Potential spring break travel surge
- Economic recovery indicators

Weak Evidence:
- Speculative impacts of government shutdown
- Limited predictive power of January data for February/March

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Period: 7 days (Feb 23-Mar 1, 2026)
- If timeframe halved: Expect more volatile, less representative sample
- If timeframe doubled: More stable, potentially more representative average

(d) Justification:
- Government shutdown creates significant uncertainty
- Historical passenger volumes provide baseline
- Seasonal travel patterns suggest potential variability

Distribution Calibration:
- Centered around historical daily averages
- Wider intervals to account for shutdown uncertainty
- Consider potential staffing and travel disruptions

Checklist:
1. Target: US airline passenger volume for Feb 23-Mar 1, 2026, according to TSA
2. Base Rate: 2.2-2.7 million daily passengers
3. Consistency Check: Implied median ≈ 15 million, mean similar - aligned with analysis
4. Key Evidence:
   - Government shutdown impact
   - Historical passenger volumes
   - Seasonal travel trends
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected resolution of government shutdown
6. Status Quo: Slight tendency towards recent historical averages
7. Technicalities: Percentiles increasing, within specified bounds
