Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:
Key Sources on US Airline Travel in February 2026:

1. Government Shutdown Articles (Travel and Tour World, Feb 14-15, 2026)
- Quality: High (multiple corroborating sources)
- Factual Information: 
  * TSA workers working without pay
  * Potential airport disruptions
  * 95% of TSA workforce still required to work
- Expert Opinion: John Rose (Altour) warns of potential travel disruptions

2. Flight BI Air Traffic Report (January 2026)
- Quality: Moderate-High
- Factual Information:
  * January 2026 domestic passenger traffic: 45.4 million
  * Year-over-year domestic passenger growth: 2.5%
- Limitations: Does not directly predict February volumes

3. TSA Checkpoint Travel Numbers
- Quality: High (official source)
- Factual Information:
  * Daily passenger numbers range 1.3-2.8 million
  * Latest data point (Feb 12, 2026): 2,701,700 passengers

(b) Evidence Analysis:
Strong Evidence:
- Consistent government shutdown impact warnings
- Historical TSA checkpoint data showing daily passenger ranges
- Ongoing post-pandemic travel recovery trends

Moderate Evidence:
- Airline industry reports showing steady passenger growth
- Economic indicators suggesting continued travel demand

Weak Evidence:
- Speculative articles about potential travel disruptions

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Window: Feb 23-Mar 1, 2026 (7 days)
- If timeframe halved: Likely lower total passengers due to fewer travel days
- If timeframe doubled: Potential for more variability, higher total passengers

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Base Rates:
1. Government shutdown potential disruptions
2. Continued post-pandemic travel recovery
3. Seasonal travel patterns
4. Economic stability

Distribution calibration:
- Centered prediction around historical daily averages
- Wide intervals to account for shutdown uncertainties
- Considered potential variability in travel volumes

Checklist:
1. Target: US airline passenger volume for Feb 23-Mar 1, 2026, according to TSA
2. Base rate: 2.2-2.7 million daily passengers
3. Consistency check: Median around 15 million, mean similar - aligned with analysis
4. Key Evidence:
   - Government shutdown impact
   - Ongoing travel recovery
   - Seasonal travel trends
5. Blind-spot: Unexpected severe shutdown causing massive travel cancellations
6. Status quo: Slight nudge towards recent historical passenger volumes
7. Technicalities: Values increasing, within specified bounds
