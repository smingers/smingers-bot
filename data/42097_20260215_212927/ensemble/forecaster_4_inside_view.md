Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:
1. Government Shutdown Articles (Multiple Sources):
- Quality: High
- Key Factual Information:
  * TSA workers working without pay
  * Potential for increased airport disruptions
  * 95% of TSA workers still required to work
- Expert Sources: U.S. Travel Association, Airlines for America
- Potential Impact: Could reduce passenger volumes due to longer lines and potential staff absences

2. Flight Traffic Articles:
- Quality: Medium-High
- Key Factual Information:
  * Recent TSA record of 3,133,924 passengers in a single day (November 2025)
  * Continued travel recovery trends
- Limitations: Historical data, not direct predictors of February 2026

(b) Evidence Analysis:
Strong Evidence:
- Government shutdown's potential to disrupt air travel
- Continued post-pandemic travel recovery momentum
- Historical precedent of high-volume travel days

Moderate Evidence:
- Seasonal travel patterns
- Economic indicators suggesting continued travel demand

Weak Evidence:
- Speculative impact of specific shutdown details
- Short-term market sentiment fluctuations

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction Period: 7 days (Feb 23-Mar 1, 2026)
- If timeframe halved: Potentially more volatile, less representative of full trend
- If timeframe doubled: More stable, potentially smoother average

(d) Justification:
Key Factors Shifting Base Rate:
1. Government shutdown creating travel uncertainty
2. Continued post-pandemic travel recovery
3. Seasonal travel dynamics
4. Potential staff shortages at airports

Distribution Calibration:

Checklist:
1. Target: US airline passenger volume for Feb 23-Mar 1, 2026, according to TSA
2. Base Rate: Previously established distribution around 14-15 million
3. Consistency Check: Median around 14.5 million seems reasonable
4. Significant Evidence:
   - Government shutdown impact
   - Travel recovery trends
   - Seasonal travel patterns
5. Blind Spot: Unexpected major weather event or further travel restrictions
6. Status Quo: Slight tendency towards recent historical volumes
7. Technicalities: Verified increasing percentiles, within stated bounds

Percentile 10: 12500000
Percentile 20: 13500000
Percentile 40: 14500000
Percentile 60: 15500000
Percentile 80: 16500000
Percentile 90: 17000000

Rationale for Distribution:
- Centered around recent historical volumes
- Wider intervals to account for shutdown uncertainty
- Reflects potential travel disruptions and recovery trends
- Allows for variability in passenger volumes

The prediction integrates the potential impact of the government shutdown, ongoing travel recovery, and seasonal dynamics, providing a balanced probabilistic forecast for TSA passenger volumes.
