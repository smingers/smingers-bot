Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:
Recent AskNews articles primarily focus on the US government shutdown affecting TSA operations, with key insights:

1. TSA Workers Unpaid During Shutdown (Travel and Tour World, Feb 14, 2026)
- Factual: 95% of TSA workers required to work without pay
- Quality: High reliability
- Potential Impact: Increased risk of staffing disruptions, longer security lines

2. Homeland Security Shutdown (Travel and Tour World, Feb 15, 2026)
- Factual: Potential travel disruptions during spring break season
- Quality: High reliability
- Potential Impact: Possible reduction in passenger volumes

3. US Travel Disruption Alert (Travel and Tour World, Feb 14, 2026)
- Factual: Potential increased absenteeism among TSA staff
- Quality: High reliability
- Potential Impact: Localized delays and travel inefficiencies

(b) Evidence Analysis:
Strong Evidence:
- Government shutdown causing TSA operational challenges
- Potential for significant travel disruptions
- Historical precedent of shutdown impacts on air travel

Moderate Evidence:
- Seasonal travel trends suggesting potential recovery
- Economic indicators showing continued travel demand

Weak Evidence:
- Speculative long-term impacts of current shutdown

(c) Timeframe Analysis:
- Prediction for February 23-March 1, 2026 (2 weeks from current date)
- If timeframe halved: Likely more concentrated disruption
- If timeframe doubled: Potential for more normalization of operations

(d) Justification:
The government shutdown introduces significant uncertainty into passenger volume predictions. While historical trends suggest stable travel volumes, the current operational challenges could substantially impact passenger numbers.

Distribution calibration:
Considering the shutdown's potential impacts, I'll adjust the distribution to reflect increased uncertainty and potential downside risks.

Checklist:
1. Target: US airline passenger volume for Feb 23-Mar 1, 2026, according to TSA
2. Base rate: Centered around 14 million total passengers
3. Consistency check: Median around 14.5 million seems reasonable
4. Key evidence:
   - TSA workers working without pay
   - Potential travel disruptions
   - Spring break travel season
5. Blind spot: Rapid resolution of government shutdown could dramatically improve travel
6. Status quo: Slight bias towards maintaining recent travel volumes
7. Technicalities: Verified strictly increasing percentiles

Percentile 10: 12000000
Percentile 20: 12750000
Percentile 40: 13750000
Percentile 60: 14750000
Percentile 80: 15500000
Percentile 90: 16250000

Rationale: The distribution reflects potential disruptions from the government shutdown while maintaining a central expectation of continued travel demand. The wider intervals at the 10th and 90th percentiles account for significant uncertainty in TSA operations and potential unexpected developments.
