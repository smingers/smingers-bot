Disagreement Analysis:

The forecasters are remarkably aligned in their overall approach and reasoning, but there are a few notable differences:

1. **Central estimate and distribution width**: Forecaster 5 has a notably lower central estimate (median ~14.25M) compared to forecasters 2, 3, and 4 (median ~15M). Forecaster 1 falls in between (~14.375M). The spread between P10 and P90 ranges from $4.25M (forecaster 5) to $5M (forecasters 2 and 3). This disagreement matters because it shifts the entire distribution by roughly 500K-750K passengers.

2. **Baseline daily passenger volume assumption**: All forecasters reference daily passenger volumes of roughly 2.0-2.7 million, but they differ on what the expected daily average should be for this specific late-February period. Forecasters 2, 3, and 4 seem to assume a higher daily average (~2.1-2.2M/day yielding ~15M for 7 days), while forecaster 5 assumes something closer to ~2.0M/day. The key factual question is: what were actual TSA checkpoint numbers for the equivalent week in February 2024 and 2025?

3. **Government shutdown impact magnitude**: All forecasters mention the government shutdown as a risk factor, but they differ on how much it would actually reduce passenger volumes. Forecasters 2 and 3 treat it as creating wider uncertainty bands, while forecaster 5 appears to weight it more heavily as a downside risk, pulling the central estimate lower. The factual question is whether a government shutdown is actually ongoing or imminent, and what the historical impact on passenger volumes has been during past shutdowns.

Root Causes:

1. **Central estimate differences**: Different base rate assumptions about what "normal" late-February weekly passenger volume looks like. This is resolvable with historical TSA data.

2. **Daily passenger baseline**: Different factual beliefs about typical late-February daily volumes. Resolvable by checking TSA checkpoint data for equivalent periods in 2024 and 2025.

3. **Government shutdown impact**: Partly different factual beliefs (is there actually a shutdown happening?) and partly different weighting of the same evidence (how much does a shutdown reduce travel?). The factual component is resolvable.
