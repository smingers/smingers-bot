Resolution of Disagreements:

1. **Government shutdown status**: Research confirms a partial government shutdown began on February 14, 2026, affecting DHS (and thus TSA). 63,000 TSA employees will work without pay. Congress is on recess until February 23, meaning the shutdown will likely still be in effect at the start of the forecast period (Feb 23-Mar 1). This validates all forecasters' concerns about shutdown impacts.

2. **Historical shutdown impact**: Research found that a previous shutdown (Oct 1 - Nov 12, 2025, lasting 43 days) occurred, and the current one is partial (only DHS). During past shutdowns, TSA maintained ~95% workforce as essential personnel. The impact on actual passenger volumes has historically been modest - passengers still fly, though wait times increase. This suggests the shutdown is more of a service quality issue than a volume issue.

3. **Baseline daily passenger volumes**: Research confirms that daily TSA volumes in recent periods have been around 2.4-2.7 million on typical days, with a record of 3 million on January 17, 2026. February 2025 data shows daily volumes closely aligned with 2024 levels. The article from flightbi.com confirms February is a relatively normal travel month without major holiday surges.

4. **Central estimate calibration**: For a 7-day period in late February (which includes weekdays and a weekend), typical daily volumes would be approximately 2.0-2.5 million per day. Weekdays tend to be lower (~2.0-2.3M) while Fridays and Sundays are higher (~2.5-2.7M). A reasonable 7-day total would be approximately 15.5-17.5 million based on recent trends showing year-over-year growth.

Wait - I need to reconsider. The forecasters are all centering around 14-15 million for 7 days, which implies ~2.0-2.1 million per day. But recent data shows daily volumes of 2.4-2.7 million. Let me recalculate.

Looking at the data more carefully: Feb 12, 2026 showed 2,701,700 passengers. However, that could be a higher-than-average day. Late February typically has a mix of weekday lows (~1.8-2.2M) and weekend highs (~2.3-2.7M). The 7-day period Feb 23-Mar 1 includes Monday through Sunday.

Based on 2025 February patterns where daily volumes tracked 2024 levels, and considering ~3-5% year-over-year growth, a typical late-February week in 2026 would likely see:
- Weekday average: ~2.2-2.4M
- Weekend average: ~2.5-2.8M
- Weekly total: ~16-17.5M

The forecasters appear to be underestimating the baseline. However, the partial government shutdown could create some modest downward pressure (perhaps 2-5% reduction due to longer lines discouraging some travel, though most passengers would still fly).

The weighted average median of ~15M seems somewhat low given recent daily volumes consistently above 2.3M. I'll adjust upward slightly while maintaining wide uncertainty bands for the shutdown.

Updated Analysis:

The research confirms a partial government shutdown affecting TSA, but historical evidence suggests shutdowns have modest impact on actual passenger volumes (TSA maintains 95% workforce). Recent daily volumes (2.4-2.7M) suggest a 7-day total closer to 16-17M rather than the 14-15M central estimates from most forecasters. I'm adjusting the central estimate upward while keeping wide uncertainty bands for shutdown-related disruptions and potential weather events.
