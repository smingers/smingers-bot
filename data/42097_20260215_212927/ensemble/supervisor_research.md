Disclaimer: The provided article does not directly address the specific forecasting question about US airline passenger volume for February 2026. The text is a technical discussion about data aggregation methods for time series data, specifically focusing on TSA checkpoint screening volumes and the differences between ISO weeks and CDC epidemiological (epi)weeks.

Key Points:
1. The article discusses technical challenges in aggregating daily TSA checkpoint screening data into weekly totals
2. Main technical issues include:
   - Determining how to handle partial weeks at the start/end of the year
   - Differences between ISO week and CDC epiweek conventions
   - Ensuring each "week" contains exactly 7 days when summing data

3. The author demonstrates how using epiweek() and epiyear() functions can create a more consistent weekly aggregation method for time series data

4. The article uses TSA checkpoint screening data as an example of analyzing travel volumes, noting the significant impact of COVID-19 on travel patterns

While the article provides interesting technical insights into data aggregation, it does not contain any specific information about projected airline passenger volumes for February 2026.

<Summary source="https://www.crfb.org/blogs/congress-could-end-government-shutdown-drama-once-and-all">
Disclaimer: This article does not directly address US airline passenger volume for February 2026. The content is primarily about potential legislative efforts to prevent government shutdowns.

Key Extracted Information:

Relevant Contextual Details about Government Shutdowns:
1. A recent government shutdown occurred from October 1, 2025 to November 12, 2025 (43 days long)

2. Government shutdowns impact air travel, specifically noting that:
- Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents go unpaid
- Such situations have historically put strain on air travel

3. Economic Impact of Shutdowns:
- Congressional Budget Office estimated the October 2025 shutdown would result in $11 billion loss in real GDP

<Agent_report>
Query: What were the total TSA checkpoint passenger volumes for the week of February 24 through March 2, 2025, and the week of February 26 through March 3, 2024? Also, is there currently a US government shutdown in effect as of February 2026, and if so, what has been its impact on TSA staffing and airport operations?
Based on the search results, I can provide a comprehensive analysis addressing the original query about TSA checkpoint passenger volumes and the US government shutdown status in February 2026.

TSA Checkpoint Passenger Volumes:
Unfortunately, the search results do not provide the specific passenger volumes for the weeks of February 24-March 2, 2025, and February 26-March 3, 2024. The most recent comprehensive passenger data comes from a Statista report highlighting TSA checkpoint volumes in June 2024:

- June 2024 was the busiest month ever at U.S. airports
- Average daily passenger throughput was 2.73 million
- On June 23, 2024, a record 2.99 million people were screened at U.S. airports
- Through June 29, 2024, average daily passenger traffic stood at 2.43 million

US Government Shutdown Status (February 2026):
Multiple sources confirm a partial government shutdown is in effect as of February 2026, specifically affecting the Department of Homeland Security (DHS):

Key Shutdown Details:
- Shutdown began at midnight on February 14, 2026
- Primarily caused by disputes over immigration enforcement
- Only affects DHS, not the entire federal government

Impact on TSA and Airport Operations:
1. TSA Staffing:
- Approximately 95% of TSA's 63,000 employees are considered essential personnel
- Employees will work without pay
- Potential increased risk of unscheduled absences and call-outs
- Acting TSA Administrator Ha Nguyen Mc Neill warned of potential disruptions

2. Airport Security Implications:
- Possible longer security wait times
- Potential for scattered disruptions that could escalate if shutdown continues
- Travel industry groups warned of potential flight delays and cancellations
- Air traffic controllers are not directly affected, as Department of Transportation is funded

Specific Shutdown Triggers:
- Democrats are demanding new restrictions on Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)
- Triggered by recent fatal shootings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis
- Democrats want reforms including warrant requirements, agent identification, and use of force policies

Shutdown Duration and Negotiations:
- Congress is on a scheduled break until February 23
- Negotiations between Democrats and the White House are ongoing
- No immediate resolution appears imminent

Limitations in Available Data:
- Exact passenger volumes for the specific weeks requested could not be located
- Precise impact on airport operations will depend on shutdown duration

Recommendations for Travelers:
- Allow extra time for airport security
- Check airport websites for current wait times
- Practice patience with TSA personnel working without pay

While the search results provide comprehensive context about the 2026 government shutdown, they do not include the specific TSA checkpoint passenger volumes requested in the original query. To obtain those precise figures, additional targeted research would be necessary.</Agent_report>

<Summary source="https://www.ainvest.com/news/tsa-passenger-volumes-february-9-record-normal-holiday-echo-2602/">
Summary of the Article:

Key Facts and Statistics:
- On January 17, 2026, US airports hit a record 3 million passengers in a single day
- This is the third consecutive year of strong holiday season travel demand
- A prediction market exists specifically tracking passenger counts for February 9, 2026

Relevant Opinions and Insights:
- The article suggests the record passenger day might be a seasonal peak rather than a new baseline
- The key test will be whether passenger volumes can sustain levels above 2.5 million passengers
- The February 9, 2026 TSA passenger count is seen as a critical data point to determine if this is a trend or a holiday anomaly

Market and Operational Implications:
- Higher passenger volumes benefit airlines (increased RASM) and airport operators (more fees and concession sales)
- Increased passenger volumes also create operational challenges like longer lines and potential delays
- Investors are advised to monitor weekly TSA data for sustained trends

Predictive Indicator:
- A consistent TSA passenger count above 2.5 million would suggest a new travel normal
- A drop below 2.5 million would indicate the 3-million-passenger day was a seasonal peak

The article emphasizes that the upcoming TSA passenger data will be crucial in determining whether the January record represents a new travel trend or a holiday-driven anomaly.
