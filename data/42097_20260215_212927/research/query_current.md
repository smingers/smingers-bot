Analysis:
To forecast US airline passenger volume for late February 2026, I'll seek current information about airline travel trends, recovery patterns, seasonal variations, and economic indicators that might influence air travel. Key factors to investigate include:
- Post-pandemic travel recovery trajectory
- Winter/early spring travel demand
- Economic conditions affecting leisure and business travel
- Current airline capacity and booking trends

The goal is to find recent data and expert projections about passenger volume that can help estimate the TSA screening numbers for the specified week. I'll look for sources discussing current air travel trends, economic forecasts, and airline industry predictions that might indicate passenger volume in early 2026.
