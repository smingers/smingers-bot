Analysis:
This forecasting question seeks to predict US airline passenger volume for a specific week in February 2026, as measured by TSA passenger screening numbers. To generate a robust outside view forecast, we'll need historical context on:
1. Seasonal passenger volume trends in late February
2. Post-pandemic airline recovery patterns
3. Recent February passenger volumes as a baseline
4. Potential factors affecting travel during this specific time period (winter travel, holiday patterns, economic conditions)

The key is finding consistent TSA passenger screening data that can help establish a baseline and trend for February passenger volumes in recent years, particularly 2024-2025 as the most recent comparable periods.

Search queries:
1. TSA passenger screening numbers February (Google)
2. Airline travel volume winter 2025 (Google News)
3. Analyze historical TSA passenger screening data for February, including seasonal trends, post-pandemic recovery patterns, and factors influencing winter travel volumes in recent years. (Agent)
4. PASSENGERS (FRED) -- to check for any relevant economic passenger volume indicators

Rationale for queries:
- Google query focuses on finding raw TSA data
- News query looks for recent reporting on travel trends
- Agent query seeks a more comprehensive analysis of contextual factors
- FRED query checks for any standardized economic passenger tracking

The goal is to build a data-driven context for understanding potential passenger volume in the target week, accounting for seasonal variations and recent travel patterns.
