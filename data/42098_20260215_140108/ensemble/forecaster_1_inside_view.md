Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Official TSA Data (tsa.gov)**: Primary authoritative source showing actual passenger volumes. For Feb 9-12, 2026: 9,014,806 passengers confirmed. Quality: Highest (government official data). Date: Current through Feb 12, 2026.

**AskNews Articles - Government Shutdown Coverage (Multiple sources, Feb 13-15, 2026)**: CNBC, CNN, Texarkana Gazette, Travel and Tour World, Simple Flying, Univision, PBS all report DHS shutdown beginning Feb 14-15, 2026. TSA agents (~50,000, 95% of workforce) working without pay. Key expert opinions:
- **Geoff Freeman (U.S. Travel Association CEO)**: Warns of longer TSA lines, flight delays if shutdown drags on
- **Jeffrey Price (Aviation Professor, Metro State Denver)**: "System becomes more brittle" over time
- **Industry consensus**: Risk increases with duration, but immediate impact minimal

Quality: High (multiple independent major news sources). Date: Feb 13-15, 2026 (current). **Critical timing**: Shutdown started Saturday Feb 14, affecting only 2 of 7 days in question period.

**Historical Shutdown Reference (PBS, October 2025)**: 2018-19 shutdown lasted 35 days; Miami airport closed terminal due to TSA sick-outs after ~3 weeks. Current shutdown involves only DHS (TSA), not FAA, so air traffic controllers remain paid. Quality: High. Relevance: Moderate (different scope than current shutdown).

**REAL ID Articles (CNN/CNBC, January 2026)**: $45 fee for non-compliant travelers starting Feb 1, 2026. TSA estimates 6% lack REAL ID, but 200,000/day flew without it post-May 2025 without major disruption. Quality: High. Impact: Minimal (94% already compliant).

**IATA Forecast (Travel and Tour World, Feb 3, 2026)**: Willie Walsh (IATA Director General) states U.S. market "broadly flat" in 2026 due to "perfect storm" including 43-day 2025 shutdown effects, January 2026 winter storm, political tensions. Quality: High (named expert, major aviation authority). Date: Feb 3, 2026. **This contradicts the strong YoY growth shown in actual TSA data through Feb 8.**

**Record Travel Day Articles (November-December 2025)**: TSA recorded 3.13M passengers on Nov 30, 2025 (new record). All top 10 busiest days occurred in 2024-2025. Quality: High. Relevance: Shows strong demand trend continuing into late 2025.

**Chinese Spring Festival Travel (Multiple sources, Feb 2-15, 2026)**: China expecting 95M civil aviation passengers during 40-day period (2.38M/day average). Quality: High but **irrelevant** - these are Chinese domestic flights, not U.S. TSA data.

**Seattle Airport (Port of Seattle, date unclear)**: SEA expecting 900K passengers Feb 12-16, 2025 for Presidents Day, up 4% YoY. Quality: Medium (regional data). **Date confusion**: Article appears to reference 2025, not 2026.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Actual data for Feb 9-12, 2026: 9,014,806 passengers** (4 of 7 days complete). This is factual, verified, and provides a concrete floor. Daily average: 2,253,702.
- **Multiple independent sources confirm DHS/TSA shutdown starting Feb 14-15, 2026**. Causal mechanism: unpaid workers → potential sick-outs → longer lines/delays. However, historical pattern shows effects take 2-3 weeks to materialize significantly.
- **Presidents Day weekend (Feb 16, 2026)** creates pre-holiday travel surge on Feb 13-15. This is a well-established seasonal pattern.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Recent 7-day rolling averages (Feb 1-8, 2026): 14.2-14.5M** with YoY growth of 14-21%. Shows strong demand trend, though IATA's "flat" forecast contradicts this.
- **Historical shutdown patterns**: 2018-19 shutdown took ~3 weeks before major disruptions. Current shutdown only affects 2 of 7 days in question period (Feb 14-15), limiting immediate impact.
- **Weekend travel patterns**: Typically 35-40% of weekly volume occurs Fri-Sun. Feb 13-15 are Fri-Sun before Presidents Day.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **REAL ID $45 fee**: Only affects 6% of travelers, and 200K/day continued flying without REAL ID post-May 2025. Minimal impact expected.
- **IATA "flat" forecast**: Contradicted by actual TSA data showing 14-21% YoY growth through Feb 8, 2026. May reflect airline industry pessimism rather than actual demand.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: The week Feb 9-15, 2026 is essentially complete as of today (Feb 15). We have 4 of 7 days confirmed (9.01M), need to estimate remaining 3 days (Feb 13-15).

**If timeframe were halved** (3.5 days): We'd have nearly complete data, reducing uncertainty dramatically. Prediction would be highly confident.

**If timeframe were doubled** (14 days): Would include full Presidents Day week plus following week. Shutdown effects would be more pronounced in second week, increasing downside risk. Seasonal patterns would show post-holiday decline in second week.

**Key timing consideration**: Shutdown began Feb 14 (Saturday), affecting only 2 of the 7 days in question. Historical patterns suggest major disruptions take 2-3 weeks to develop, meaning Feb 14-15 likely saw minimal impact beyond potential anxiety/early arrivals.

## (d) Justification

**Baseline from outside view**: 10th-90th percentile range of 14.8M-17.4M, centered around 16.0-16.5M.

**Factors supporting upward adjustment:**
1. **Strong Mon-Thu performance**: 9.01M for first 4 days (2.25M/day average) exceeds recent daily averages of ~2.04M, suggesting robust demand.
2. **Presidents Day weekend effect**: Feb 13-15 captures pre-holiday surge. Historical patterns show weekend travel 35-40% of weekly total, and holiday weekends skew higher.
3. **Shutdown timing limits impact**: Only 2 of 7 days affected, and historical precedent shows 2-3 week lag before major disruptions.

**Factors supporting downward adjustment:**
1. **Shutdown uncertainty**: Even if major disruptions unlikely in 48 hours, passenger anxiety could suppress some travel or cause early departures on Feb 13.
2. **IATA forecast pessimism**: While contradicted by recent data, industry experts may have insight into booking softness not yet visible in screening numbers.

**Net assessment**: The strong Mon-Thu base (9.01M) combined with Presidents Day weekend surge should push the week above recent averages (14.2-14.5M). However, shutdown uncertainty on Feb 14-15 creates downside risk. 

**Weekend projection**: 
- Conservative (disruption scenario): 5.5M for Fri-Sun = 14.5M total
- Moderate (normal pre-holiday): 6.5M for Fri-Sun = 15.5M total
- Strong (robust holiday surge): 7.5M for Fri-Sun = 16.5M total
- Very strong (record demand): 8.5M for Fri-Sun = 17.5M total

Given the strong start and holiday timing, I expect the moderate-to-strong scenario (15.5-16.5M) as most likely, with shutdown effects creating modest downside risk rather than the severe disruption that would push below 15M.

## Distribution Calibration

**Known floor**: 9,014,806 (confirmed for Feb 9-12)

**Weekend scenarios**:
- 10th percentile (significant disruption): Fri-Sun = 5.3M → Total = 14.3M
- 20th percentile (modest disruption): Fri-Sun = 5.9M → Total = 14.9M
- 40th percentile (slight below normal): Fri-Sun = 6.6M → Total = 15.6M
- 60th percentile (normal pre-holiday): Fri-Sun = 7.2M → Total = 16.2M
- 80th percentile (strong holiday surge): Fri-Sun = 7.8M → Total = 16.8M
- 90th percentile (exceptional demand): Fri-Sun = 8.4M → Total = 17.4M

**Calibration considerations**:
- The 9.01M floor is certain, reducing left-tail risk
- Presidents Day weekend creates natural upward pull
- Shutdown started late (Feb 14), limiting immediate impact
- Recent YoY growth of 14-21% suggests strong underlying demand
- Weekend typically represents 35-40% of weekly volume; my projections assume 37-47% for Fri-Sun, reasonable given holiday timing

**Consistency check**: Median ~16.0M, mean ~16.1M. This represents ~12% growth over recent 7-day averages (14.2-14.5M), consistent with observed YoY growth rates and holiday weekend boost.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Total TSA checkpoint passengers screened Feb 9-15, 2026 (7 days). Units: passengers.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 14.8M (10th) to 17.4M (90th), centered 16.0-16.5M. My final prediction maintains this range with slight downward adjustment for shutdown risk.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 16.0M; mean = 16.1M. Makes sense given strong Mon-Thu base (9.01M) plus normal-to-strong holiday weekend (7.0M).

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Feb 9-12 actual: 9,014,806 passengers (factual, certain)
   - Presidents Day weekend Feb 16 drives pre-holiday surge Feb 13-15 (strong historical pattern)
   - DHS shutdown began Feb 14, affecting only 2 of 7 days (factual, multiple sources)
   - Historical shutdowns take 2-3 weeks for major disruptions (2018-19 precedent)
   - Recent YoY growth 14-21% through Feb 8 (factual from TSA data)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Severe weather event or security incident on Feb 13-15 causing airport closures/mass cancellations. Would push outcome DOWN significantly, potentially below 14M. Not mentioned in any sources, so appears unlikely but possible.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Recent 7-day averages of 14.2-14.5M represent status quo. My prediction of 16.0M median represents ~12% increase, justified by holiday weekend effect and strong Mon-Thu start. Volatility is moderate (holiday travel predictable, shutdown effects uncertain but time-limited).

7. **Technicalities**: Values in passengers (whole numbers), strictly increasing, within 12M-17M range (question bounds 12M-17M open).
