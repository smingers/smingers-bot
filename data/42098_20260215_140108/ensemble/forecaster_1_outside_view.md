Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**TSA Checkpoint Travel Numbers (tsa.gov)** - Official TSA data showing actual passenger volumes. For the target period Feb 9-15, 2026, we have complete data for 4 days (Feb 9-12: 9,014,806 passengers total), with 3 days missing (Feb 13-15). This is the primary authoritative source. Date: Current (Feb 15, 2026).

**Google Spreadsheet** - Contains historical TSA data through Feb 8, 2026, showing 7-day rolling averages around 14.2-14.5 million with YoY growth of 14-21%. This provides crucial baseline context. Quality: High (appears to be compiled from official TSA data). Date: Through Feb 8, 2026.

**Kieran Healy Blog** - Methodological discussion about aggregating TSA data using epidemiological weeks. Useful for understanding data patterns but contains no forecasts. Quality: Medium (academic blog). Date: February 20, 2025 (past event from our Feb 15, 2026 perspective).

**CBP February 2025 Update** - Irrelevant; discusses border enforcement, not airline passengers.

**CNN & CNBC REAL ID Articles** - Discuss new $45 fee for non-compliant travelers starting Feb 1, 2026. TSA estimates ~6% of passengers lack REAL ID. This could theoretically suppress demand, but the articles note 94% compliance already exists. Quality: High (major news outlets with TSA official quotes). Date: January 2026.

**BBC Government Shutdown Article** - Reports partial DHS shutdown beginning Feb 15, 2026 (today), potentially affecting TSA workers. Airlines warned of possible delays and worker absences. However, the article notes this is "unlikely to cause as much travel chaos as last year's" since FAA is funded. Quality: High. Date: Feb 14, 2026 (yesterday). **Critical timing consideration.**

**Agent Report** - Correctly identifies that we lack complete historical data for Feb 9-15 across years 2019-2025, and notes no TSA forecast exists for this specific week. The report highlights data gaps but doesn't provide the missing numbers.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **Same calendar week in previous years (2019-2025)** - Most directly comparable, accounts for seasonal patterns
2. **Recent 7-day periods in Feb 2026** - Captures current year trends but limited sample
3. **Presidents Day week travel** - Feb 9-15, 2026 includes the approach to Presidents Day (Feb 16, 2026)

**Most suitable:** Same calendar week in previous years, adjusted for growth trends. However, we face a critical data limitation - we only have 4 of 7 days for 2026, and the agent report confirms we lack the complete historical comparison data.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The question asks about Feb 9-15, 2026. Today is Feb 15, 2026, meaning:
- 4 days (Feb 9-12) are complete: 9,014,806 passengers
- 3 days (Feb 13-15) are yet to be reported but have already occurred

**Historical patterns:**
- Recent 7-day rolling averages (Feb 1-8, 2026): ~14.2-14.5 million
- YoY growth rates in early Feb 2026: 14-21%
- Weekend days typically show higher volumes than mid-week
- Friday-Sunday (Feb 13-15) would be expected to have higher traffic

**Key contextual factors:**
1. **REAL ID fee** (started Feb 1): Minimal impact expected since 94% already compliant
2. **Government shutdown** (started Feb 15): Could cause disruptions, but timing suggests limited impact on most of the week
3. **Presidents Day weekend approaching**: Feb 16 is Presidents Day, so Feb 13-15 would capture pre-holiday travel surge

## (d) Justification

We have 9,014,806 passengers for the first 4 days (Mon-Thu). To estimate the full week:

**Pattern analysis from recent data:**
- Feb 1-8 rolling average: ~14.3 million for 7 days = ~2.04 million/day average
- But this includes weekend peaks and weekday troughs
- Feb 9-12 average: 9,014,806 / 4 = 2,253,702/day (higher than overall average, suggesting strong start)

**Weekend projection (Feb 13-15):**
Looking at typical patterns, Friday-Sunday often represents 35-40% of weekly volume in normal weeks. Given:
- Strong start (Mon-Thu: 9.01M)
- Pre-Presidents Day travel surge expected
- Recent daily peaks reaching 2.7M (Feb 12)

Conservative estimate for Fri-Sun: 6.5-7.5 million
Mid-range estimate: 7.0 million
Optimistic estimate: 7.5-8.0 million

**Total week projection:** 15.5-17.0 million (central estimate: ~16.0-16.5 million)

**Uncertainty factors:**
- Government shutdown impact unknown but likely minimal for most of week
- Actual weekend surge magnitude uncertain
- Weather or other disruptions not captured in available data

## Outside view calibration:

Given we have 4 of 7 days complete at 9.01M, the remaining 3 days determine the outcome. 

**Baseline scenarios:**
- Conservative (3-day total: 5.5M): Weekly total = 14.5M
- Moderate (3-day total: 6.5M): Weekly total = 15.5M  
- Strong (3-day total: 7.5M): Weekly total = 16.5M
- Very strong (3-day total: 8.5M): Weekly total = 17.5M

The 7-day rolling averages from Feb 1-8 ranged 14.2-14.5M, but showed consistent YoY growth of 14-21%. Given the strong Mon-Thu performance and Presidents Day weekend effect, I expect this week to exceed recent averages.

**Distribution considerations:**
- 10th percentile: Significant disruption scenario (shutdown effects, weather)
- 50th percentile: Normal pre-holiday weekend surge
- 90th percentile: Exceptionally strong travel demand

The government shutdown starting Feb 15 primarily affects that single day, limiting downside risk. The strong Mon-Thu base (9.01M) provides a floor.
