Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Data Sources:**
1. **TSA checkpoint data (tsa.gov)**: Primary government source, highly reliable. Shows Mon 9 Feb through Thu 12 Feb 2026 totaling 9,015,000 passengers. Missing Fri 13, Sat 14, Sun 15 Feb data (will be posted Mon 17 Feb).

2. **Google spreadsheet archive**: Historical TSA data through 8 Feb 2026. Shows week of 2-8 Feb averaged 2.07M daily (14.48M weekly). Reliable historical context.

**News Sources (all dated 13-15 Feb 2026):**

3. **Multiple sources on DHS/TSA shutdown** (CNBC, Texarkana Gazette, Travel And Tour World, Simple Flying, Univision, Economic Times - all Feb 13-15, 2026): **STRONG FACTUAL EVIDENCE**. All independently confirm that a partial DHS shutdown began Feb 14-15, 2026, with ~50,000 TSA agents (95% of workforce) working without pay. These are reputable news outlets reporting the same facts.

4. **Industry warnings** (Airlines for America, U.S. Travel Association, American Hotel & Lodging Association joint statement - Feb 13, 2026): **MODERATE EVIDENCE**. Expert industry groups warn of potential "unscheduled absences," longer wait times, and missed flights. This is informed opinion from domain experts, not yet observed fact.

5. **Historical precedent** (PBS News, Oct 2, 2025; multiple sources): **MODERATE EVIDENCE**. During 2018-19 shutdown (35 days) and 2024 shutdown (43 days), TSA agents called in sick at elevated rates after ~3 weeks without pay. Miami International closed a terminal; delays occurred system-wide. However, current shutdown just started Feb 14-15, so immediate impact likely minimal.

6. **Recent record volumes** (Benzinga, Dec 2, 2025): TSA screened 3.13M passengers on Nov 30, 2025 - a single-day record. Shows strong underlying demand trend. **FACTUAL**.

7. **China/Vietnam travel data**: Multiple articles about Chinese Spring Festival travel (Feb 2-Mar 13, 2026). **NOT RELEVANT** - these are Chinese domestic aviation figures, not US TSA data.

8. **IATA forecast** (Travel And Tour World, Feb 3, 2026): Willie Walsh notes US market expected "broadly flat" in 2026 due to shutdown effects and winter storms. **MODERATE EVIDENCE** - expert opinion with clear reasoning.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Known partial data**: Mon-Thu 9-12 Feb = 9.015M passengers (FACTUAL, primary source)
- **TSA shutdown confirmed**: Multiple independent sources confirm 95% of TSA working without pay starting Feb 14-15, 2026
- **Recent baseline**: Week of Feb 2-8 averaged 14.48M total (FACTUAL)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Holiday timing**: Feb 17, 2026 is Presidents Day (Monday). Typical pattern shows elevated Fri-Sun travel before 3-day weekends (+5-10% vs normal weekends)
- **Shutdown impact timing**: Historical precedent suggests TSA callouts increase after 2-3 weeks without pay, not immediately. Current shutdown is <48 hours old as of Feb 15.
- **Industry expert warnings**: Credible sources predict disruptions, but these are forward-looking concerns, not yet observed impacts
- **Underlying demand strength**: Nov 2025 record suggests robust baseline demand

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Weather concerns**: Articles mention potential disruptions but no specific reports for Feb 9-15 week
- **REAL-ID confusion**: Mentioned in sources but unlikely to significantly impact volumes in this specific week

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 7 days (Feb 9-15, 2026), with 4 days already known and 3 days (Fri-Sun) to be reported.

**Critical timing factors:**
- We are forecasting AS OF Feb 15, 2026 (the last day of the target week)
- TSA shutdown began Feb 14-15 (Saturday/Sunday of target week)
- Presidents Day is Feb 17 (Monday after target week ends)

**If timeframe were halved (3.5 days)**: Would have nearly complete data; prediction would be much tighter around known values.

**If timeframe were doubled (14 days)**: Would need to account for full shutdown effects materializing (increased callouts after week 2-3), making prediction much more uncertain with wider distribution.

**Key insight**: The shutdown started on the LAST TWO DAYS of our target week. Historical precedent shows TSA callouts increase after 2-3 weeks without pay, not immediately. Therefore, shutdown impact on THIS specific week (Feb 9-15) should be minimal to moderate, primarily affecting Sat 14 and Sun 15.

## (d) Justification for Adjusting Outside View

**Outside view baseline**: 15.4M (10th) to 16.5M (90th), centered around 15.95M

**Factors warranting adjustment:**

1. **Known partial total (9.015M for Mon-Thu)**: This is FACTUAL and locks in 56% of the week. No adjustment needed - this anchors our prediction.

2. **Presidents Day weekend effect**: The Fri-Sun immediately before a 3-day weekend typically sees +5-10% lift. This is a **structural holiday pattern** that warrants moderate upward adjustment.

3. **Shutdown timing**: Started Sat Feb 14 (day 6 of 7 in our week). Historical data shows immediate impact is minimal; significant callouts occur after 2-3 weeks. This warrants only a **small downward adjustment** for potential Sat-Sun disruption.

4. **Recent trend**: Feb 2-8 week showed 14.48M, suggesting strong baseline demand continues.

**Calibration logic:**
- Mon-Thu actual: 9.015M (locked)
- Expected Fri-Sun without disruption: ~6.95M (based on typical Presidents Day weekend pattern)
- Potential shutdown drag on Sat-Sun: -2% to -5% (modest, as shutdown just started)
- Net expected Fri-Sun: 6.80M to 7.05M
- **Total week range: 15.82M to 16.07M (central estimate)**

**Shift from outside view**: The outside view was appropriately calibrated but can be tightened slightly given:
- 4 of 7 days are known facts
- Shutdown timing means minimal impact on this specific week
- Presidents Day weekend provides modest uplift

The reference class (recent February weeks with holiday effects) remains highly analogous. Current circumstances don't render it obsolete, but the locked-in partial data and precise shutdown timing allow for a slightly tighter, modestly upward-adjusted distribution.

## Distribution Calibration

**Central tendency**: With 9.015M locked in and expecting 6.85-6.95M for Fri-Sun, median should be around 15.90M.

**Tail considerations:**
- **Lower tail (10th percentile)**: Worst case would be significant immediate shutdown impact (unlikely given historical lag) OR severe weather disruption (not reported). Set at 15.50M.
- **Upper tail (90th percentile)**: Strong Presidents Day surge (+10% on weekend) with no shutdown impact. Set at 16.35M.

**Distribution shape**: Should be slightly right-skewed (holiday upside potential > shutdown downside risk for this specific week).

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Total TSA passenger screenings for 7-day period Feb 9-15, 2026 (Monday through Sunday), in number of passengers.
   ✓ Analysis focuses exactly on this metric and timeframe.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 15.4M (10th) to 16.5M (90th), centered ~15.95M
   ✓ Final prediction remains rooted to this, with modest tightening and slight upward shift due to locked-in partial data and holiday timing.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 15,900,000; mean ≈ 15,920,000. This aligns with 9.015M known + 6.88M expected for Fri-Sun, consistent with Presidents Day weekend pattern and minimal immediate shutdown impact.

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - Mon-Thu actual total: 9,015,000 (FACTUAL, locks in 56%)
   - TSA shutdown began Feb 14-15 (FACTUAL, but historical lag means minimal impact this week)
   - Presidents Day Feb 17 creates typical holiday weekend uplift (STRUCTURAL PATTERN)
   - Recent baseline week Feb 2-8: 14.48M (FACTUAL, shows strong demand)
   - Historical shutdown callouts lag 2-3 weeks (MODERATE EVIDENCE)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Severe weather event (winter storm) hitting major hubs on Fri-Sun Feb 13-15 that wasn't reported in sources. Would push outcome DOWN by 0.3-0.8M. Alternatively, immediate mass TSA callouts (contrary to historical pattern) would push DOWN.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Recent week averaged 14.48M. With Presidents Day lift, expecting 15.8-16.1M represents modest growth, not dramatic change. This feels appropriately conservative.

7. **Technicalities**: ✓ Percentiles strictly increasing, ✓ units in passengers (no scientific notation), ✓ values within 12M-17M bounds.
