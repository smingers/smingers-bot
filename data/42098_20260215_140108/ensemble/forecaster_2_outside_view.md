Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**TSA.gov Passenger Volumes (Current):**
- **Quality:** Primary source, official TSA data
- **Date:** Current as of Feb 15, 2026
- **Content:** Provides actual daily volumes for Feb 9-12, 2026: 2,386,224 + 1,852,752 + 2,074,130 + 2,701,700 = 9,014,806 passengers for first 4 days
- **Missing:** Data for Feb 13-15, 2026 (Friday-Sunday) not yet published

**Google Spreadsheet with Historical Data:**
- **Quality:** Appears to be a curated compilation of TSA data
- **Date:** Most recent entry is Feb 8, 2026
- **Content:** Shows 7-day rolling averages around 14.2-14.5 million for early February 2026, with YoY growth of 13-21%
- **Key insight:** Recent weeks show strong double-digit growth vs 2025

**Kieran Healy Blog Post:**
- **Quality:** Technical/methodological discussion by an academic
- **Relevance:** Explains epiweek aggregation but contains no forecasts or specific data for our period

**CBP February 2025 Update:**
- **Quality:** Official government source
- **Relevance:** Not relevant - focuses on border enforcement, not TSA passenger volumes

**CNN & CNBC Articles on REAL ID:**
- **Quality:** Major news outlets reporting on TSA policy
- **Date:** January 2026
- **Content:** REAL ID fee ($45) started Feb 1, 2026. TSA states ~94% compliance, 6% non-compliant
- **Potential impact:** Could marginally suppress demand, but enforcement began Feb 1, so effects would already be reflected in early Feb data

**BBC Article on Government Shutdown:**
- **Quality:** Major news outlet
- **Date:** Feb 14, 2026
- **Content:** Partial DHS shutdown began Feb 15, 2026. TSA workers may go without pay. Travel groups warn of potential delays and absences
- **Critical impact:** This is a MAJOR development occurring during our forecast period. However, the article notes this is "unlikely to cause as much travel chaos as last year's" because FAA is funded

**Agent Report:**
- **Content:** Confirms inability to retrieve complete historical data for Feb 9-15 across years 2019-2025
- **Gap:** Missing the historical reference class data needed for robust YoY analysis

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Same calendar week in previous years (Feb 9-15):** Most directly comparable, accounts for seasonal patterns, day-of-week effects, and holiday proximity (Presidents' Day is Feb 16, 2026). However, we lack complete historical data.

2. **Early-to-mid February weeks generally:** Broader but captures typical February travel patterns. February is typically a moderate travel month, not peak season.

3. **Recent 7-day periods in 2026:** We have rolling averages of ~14.2-14.5 million for early Feb 2026. This captures current trend momentum.

**Selected reference class:** Recent 7-day periods in early February 2026, adjusted for day-of-week composition and the government shutdown impact.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** The question resolves Feb 16, 2026, covering Feb 9-15, 2026. As of today (Feb 15), we have:
- **Known data:** Feb 9-12 (4 days) = 9,014,806 passengers
- **Unknown data:** Feb 13-15 (3 days) = Friday, Saturday, Sunday

**Day-of-week patterns from early Feb 2026:**
- Sundays (Feb 2, 9): ~2.15-2.39M
- Mondays (Feb 3, 10): ~1.67-1.85M  
- Tuesdays (Feb 4, 11): ~1.84-2.07M
- Wednesdays (Feb 5, 12): ~2.32-2.70M
- Thursdays (Feb 6): ~2.35M
- Fridays (Feb 7): ~1.87M
- Saturdays (Feb 8): ~2.27M

**Presidents' Day weekend effect:** Feb 16 (Monday) is Presidents' Day holiday. The preceding weekend (Feb 14-16) typically sees elevated travel. Friday Feb 13 and Sunday Feb 15 should be particularly strong.

## (d) Justification

**Base calculation from known data:**
- Feb 9-12 total: 9,014,806
- Need to estimate Feb 13-15

**Expected patterns for remaining days:**
- **Friday Feb 13:** Should be strong (pre-holiday weekend). Recent Friday (Feb 7) = 1,873,708. With holiday boost, estimate ~2.0-2.2M
- **Saturday Feb 14:** Recent Saturday (Feb 8) = 2,274,639. Valentine's Day + holiday weekend, estimate ~2.2-2.4M  
- **Sunday Feb 15:** Should be strongest day (return travel from long weekend). Recent Sunday (Feb 9) = 2,386,224. With holiday, estimate ~2.5-2.8M

**Government shutdown impact:** Began Feb 15 (today). Effects would be minimal for Feb 13-14 (already occurred) but could affect Feb 15. However, TSA workers are deemed essential and work without pay. Historical precedent suggests operations continue but with potential slowdowns. This might suppress volumes by 5-10% on Feb 15 if travelers avoid airports due to delay concerns.

**Baseline estimate:**
- Feb 9-12: 9,014,806 (known)
- Feb 13: 2,100,000 (estimate)
- Feb 14: 2,300,000 (estimate)
- Feb 15: 2,400,000 (estimate, with shutdown dampening from ~2,600,000)
- **Total baseline: ~15,815,000**

**Uncertainty factors:**
- Shutdown impact magnitude (could be larger or smaller)
- REAL ID fee dampening (likely minimal, already priced in)
- Weather disruptions (not mentioned in sources)
- Actual holiday travel strength vs expectations

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring to established patterns:**
- 7-day rolling averages in early Feb 2026: 14.2-14.5M
- YoY growth rates: 13-21% vs 2025
- Known 4-day total: 9.01M suggests daily average of 2.25M
- Remaining 3 days should average higher due to weekend/holiday effect

**Distribution considerations:**
- The 4-day total is already locked at 9.01M
- Only uncertainty is in the final 3 days (Feb 13-15)
- Friday-Sunday typically totals 6-7M in early Feb
- Holiday boost could add 500K-1M
- Shutdown could subtract 200K-500K

**Tail considerations:**
- **Lower tail (10th percentile):** Severe shutdown impact, weather disruptions, or other unforeseen issues. Feb 13-15 total only ~5.5M → Total: 14.5M
- **Upper tail (90th percentile):** Strong holiday travel, minimal shutdown impact. Feb 13-15 total ~7.5M → Total: 16.5M

**Rate of upsets:** TSA data is generally predictable with low upset rates, but the government shutdown is an unusual event that introduces meaningful uncertainty.
