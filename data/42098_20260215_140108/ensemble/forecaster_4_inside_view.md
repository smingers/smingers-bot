Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. TSA checkpoint numbers (tsa.gov, updated daily, government administrative data). Fact: 4-day subtotal 9,014,806 for Mon 2/9 – Thu 2/12/26. Highest-quality, directly determines outcome.  
2. Google-sheet compilation of TSA data (community, pulled from TSA through 2/8/26). Fact: 7-day rolling totals early Feb ≈14.2–14.5 M; YoY growth mid-teens. Good snapshot, but secondary.  
3. Multiple news reports (CNN, CNBC, AP, Texarkana Gazette, Travel & Tour World, 13–15 Feb 26) on DHS partial shutdown that started 14 Feb. Facts: 95 % of TSA officers still working; no immediate closures yet. Opinions predicting longer lines. Quality: mainstream outlets; evidence moderate—possible but not yet measured impact.  
4. AInvest 15 Jan 26 commentary about new 3 M-passenger record and >2.5 M as “new normal”. Opinion piece, low weight.  
No other source furnishes actual 2/13–2/15 traffic counts or hard disruptions; therefore the TSA page remains the pivotal input.

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong: Official TSA subtotal for 2/9-2/12.  
Moderate: Early-Feb rolling average ≈14.4 M → implies remaining three days likely 6–7.5 M.  
Moderate: Historical weekday/weekend pattern (Fri & Sun high, Sat dip).  
Weak-to-moderate: Fresh shutdown could depress numbers or slow throughput, but major effects usually appear after a week-plus; only one–two days fall under shutdown.  
Weak: Opinion pieces on demand strength (>2.5 M “new normal”).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome known when TSA posts Sun 2/15 total—typically by Mon 2/16 (≤1 day away). If the horizon were halved (0.5 day), uncertainty would fall further once Sat data posts; if doubled (2 days earlier), uncertainty would have been larger because only 2 days of data were known.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base rate from early-Feb rolling totals (≈14.4 M). Adding the now-observed 4-day subtotal (9.015 M) forces the centre of the distribution upward.  
Expected values for the remaining three days:  
• Fri 13 Feb: strong getaway day ≈2.6–2.9 M  
• Sat 14 Feb: typical Sat dip ≈1.8–2.2 M (Valentine’s Day adds a little)  
• Sun 15 Feb: strong return flow + pre-Presidents-Day ≈2.5–3.0 M  
Mean remaining ≈7.55 M; conservative low/high scenarios 6.5 M / 8.5 M.  
Combining with the known 9.015 M yields a mean ≈16.6 M,  central 80 % range about 15.5-17.4 M.  
Shutdown risk is acknowledged but judged unlikely to bite hard before Mon 2/16; winter-storm risk currently low. Thus only modest widening of tails.

Distribution calibration
10 th pct: 15,500,000 – scenario where Fri/Sun both come in soft and Sat very low (shutdown hiccup or weather).  
20 th pct: 15,900,000 – mildly soft weekend.  
40 th pct: 16,400,000 – Fri/Sun near mid-range, Sat soft.  
60 th pct: 16,700,000 – Fri & Sun upper-mid, Sat mid.  
80 th pct: 17,100,000 – Fri & Sun strong, Sat average.  
90 th pct: 17,400,000 – all three days hit high end, no capacity issues.

Checklist:
1. Variable: total TSA-screened passengers Mon 9 Feb 26 – Sun 15 Feb 26.  
2. Outside view: early-Feb rolling ≈14.4 M; updated with 4-day subtotal.  
3. Consistency: implied median ≈16.55 M, mean ≈16.6 M – matches rationale.  
4. Key evidence: (i) 2/9-2/12 subtotal 9.015 M; (ii) typical Fri/Sun peaks>2.5 M; (iii) early-Feb rolling 14.4 M; (iv) shutdown just started, minimal immediate impact; (v) Valentine/Presidents-Day travel demand.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden severe weather 14-15 Feb slashes flights → outcome <15 M.  
6. Status quo gently rising demand favours mid-16 M.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, units = passengers.
