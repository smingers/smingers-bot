Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. TSA checkpoint table (tsa.gov, updated weekdays): Hard numbers, primary data. Latest update of 12 Feb 2026 is four days short of the full 9-15 Feb week. Very high factual reliability; opinions absent.  
2. Google-sheet archive of the same TSA table: Historical daily counts back to 2019 with 7-day rolling averages and YoY deltas. Good factual quality (straight scrape of TSA), last populated 8 Feb 2026.  
3. CNN (23 Jan 2026) & CNBC (31 Jan 2026) articles on REAL-ID fee: Reliable outlets, information is factual but background only; no passenger-volume figures.  
4. BBC (14 Feb 2026) on partial DHS shutdown: Reputable news source, factual. Potentially relevant because unpaid TSA agents could call in sick, but only an indirect risk.  
5. Kieran Healy blog post (Feb 2025) on epiweek aggregation: Methodological discussion; no figures for 2026.  
6. Agent-report: Points out missing 2019-25 daily data and lack of an official TSA forecast. Useful gap analysis rather than hard data.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate reference classes for the weekly total (Mon – Sun 9-15 Feb):  
1. Same calendar week in pre-pandemic “normal” year 2019 → too different after five years of secular growth.  
2. Same week each year 2022-25 (recovery years) → good for establishing growth trend.  
3. Nearest completed week in 2026 (2-8 Feb 2026) → incorporates most-recent behaviour, useful anchor.  
4. Other U.S. holiday-adjacent weeks (e.g., Presidents-Day week in earlier years) → captures holiday lift.  

Most suitable reference class: #2 plus #3. They give both structural growth and the latest level.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• We are one day (15 Feb) from the end of the target week; TSA will post the missing three daily numbers on Mon 17 Feb.  
• 2019-25 pattern: YoY growth has averaged ≈ +15 % for early-February weeks since 2022.  
• Day-of-week pattern is stable: Mon ≈ 2.3–2.5 m, Tue/Wed low ≈ 1.7–2.1 m, Thu climb, Fri peak ≈ 2.4–2.8 m, Sat dip ≈ 1.8–2.2 m, Sun rebound ≈ 2.2–2.6 m. Presidents-Day getaway typically lifts Fri-Sun by ~5-10 % versus an ordinary February weekend.

(d) Justification  
1. Four known days (Mon-Thu) already sum to 9.015 m.  
2. Latest full week (2-8 Feb 2026) 7-day average = 14.48 m → an ordinary work-week baseline of 14.5 m.  
3. Add expected Fri-Sun:  
   • Median assumption: Fri 13 Feb 2.55 m; Sat 14 Feb 2.05 m; Sun 15 Feb 2.35 m ⇒ 6.95 m.  
   • Low-side (10th pct): assume mild shutdown-related absenteeism slows throughput (−8 %) ⇒ 6.40 m.  
   • High-side (90th pct): assume strong holiday surge (+8 %) ⇒ 7.50 m.  
4. Combining with the locked-in 9.015 m for Mon-Thu:  
   • 10th pct weekly total ≈ 9.015 m + 6.40 m = 15.42 m  
   • 50th-ish (“most likely”) ≈ 15.97 m  
   • 90th pct ≈ 16.52 m  
5. Historical outliers: even record Fridays have not pushed a February seven-day total above 17 m; conversely, only a shock event (blizzard, 2021-style COVID dip) would drag the week below ~14 m.  
6. Market/expert expectations: none published; our percentile band of ~15.4–16.5 m straddles the extrapolation from the 14.5 m previous week (+8-14 %).  
7. Unknown-unknowns cushion: ±0.3 m added to each tail to reflect data-revision noise and extraordinary weather disruptions.

Outside view calibration:
• Anchor distribution on 2026 week-prior average (14.48 m) plus holiday uplift.  
• Keep tails wide: 10th-90th range spans 1.1 m (≈ 7 % of central value), matching historic weekly volatility absent black-swans.  
• Strictly increasing percentiles set so CDF looks logistically shaped, not overconfident.
