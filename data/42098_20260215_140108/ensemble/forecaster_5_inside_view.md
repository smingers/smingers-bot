Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. TSA daily passenger-volume table (tsa.gov, updated each morning) – primary, contemporaneous, purely factual counts. Highest reliability.  
2. Crowd Google-sheet that mirrors the TSA table (updated through 8 Feb 26) – good for quick arithmetic checks but derivative; small risk of transcription error.  
3. AInvest note on the 17 Jan record day – factual record count, opinion about “new normal” is speculative. Recent (31 Jan 26).  
4. CNN 28 Jan 26 article on the now-ended partial shutdown – factual that DHS/TSA were already funded; minimal immediate traffic impact expected.  
5. New shutdown coverage (Texarkana Gazette, CNBC, Travel & Tour World, 14-15 Feb 26) – factual that DHS funding lapsed overnight 14 → 15 Feb, TSA working unpaid. Historical evidence shows throughput effects only after several days when sick-outs rise; therefore negligible for 9-15 Feb numbers except perhaps Sun-15.  
6. SEA Airport Presidents-Day outlook (Port of Seattle, 12 Feb 25) – confirms that the long weekend produces a noticeable bump; regional but directionally useful.  
7. IATA 3 Feb 26 forecast – macro view that US traffic is “flat” in 2026; credible, but monthly horizons, not day-to-day.  
The daily TSA series (#1) is the only source that directly constrains the target week; shutdown and holiday articles supply context.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong:  
• Published TSA counts for Mon-Thu 9-12 Feb 26 (total 9.015 M).  
• Last week’s Fri-Sun pattern (6.500 M).  
Moderate:  
• 11-16 % weekday-on-weekday growth seen so far this week → +13 % trend estimate.  
• Presidents-Day long-week-end effect historically lifts the preceding Friday and following Monday/Sunday by ~0.25-0.35 M each.  
Weak:  
• REAL-ID $45 “verification” fee – no visible traffic dip yet.  
• Day-one DHS shutdown – throughput historically flat on first weekend.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution is 1-day away; we are forecasting the three still-unknown daily figures (Fri-Sat-Sun).  If the horizon were doubled (two weeks), winter-storm and shutdown-fatigue risks would loom larger and widen the distribution by ~20 %.  Halving it (forecast made tomorrow after Fri numbers post) would cut σ by roughly one-third.

(d) Justification / inside-view update  
Reference class = previous week’s pattern scaled by the +13 % growth now visible.  
Baseline: Fri 2.656 M, Sat 2.118 M, Sun 2.595 M → week 16.38 M.  
Adjustments:  
+0.15 M Fri and +0.05 M Sun for Presidents-Day bump (+0.20 M).  
–0.05 M total for a small chance Sun security lines deter some travellers.  
Point estimate 16.53 M.  
Uncertainty: σ≈0.75 M (weather / absentee tails).  Add fat tails: 5 % each side allow ±1.4 M swings.  Distribution is therefore centred on 16.5 M with wide but realistic bounds.

Distribution calibration
Outside-view 50 % band (15.7-16.6 M) broadened to reflect tail risks.  Percentiles below are monotone, in passengers screened:

Percentile 10  ≈ μ – 1.6 σ → 14.9 M  
20  ≈ μ – 1.2 σ → 15.4 M  
40  ≈ μ – 0.4 σ → 16.0 M  
60  ≈ μ + 0.1 σ → 16.6 M  
80  ≈ μ + 0.9 σ → 17.3 M  
90  ≈ μ + 1.4 σ → 18.0 M

Checklist:  
1. Target = total TSA passengers Mon 9 Feb 26 – Sun 15 Feb 26, units = passengers.  
2. Base rate from previous week gives 16.38 M; distribution rooted here.  
3. Implied median 16.6 M; mean ≈16.65 M; consistent with +15 % YoY trend.  
4. Key evidence: (i) Mon-Thu counts 9.015 M; (ii) +13 % WoW weekday growth; (iii) Presidents-Day bump; (iv) no major storm reported; (v) shutdown just started.  
5. Blind-spot: large winter storm grounding flights Sat-Sun would push total well below 15 M.  
6. Status-quo (repeat of last week) = 15.5 M; we have tilted upward but not drastically.  
7. Values strictly increasing; units OK; within open bounds.
