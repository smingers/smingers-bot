Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. TSA daily table (tsa.gov, updated 14 Feb 2026). Factual, primary data. Gives the four published figures we already have for the target week (2/9-2/12). No opinion content. Very high reliability.  
2. Crowd-maintained Google sheet (last row 8 Feb 2026). Factual copy of the same TSA table with rolling-average and YoY columns added. Minor risk of transcription error but generally reliable because numbers can be spot-checked against the TSA site.  
3. CNN & CNBC articles on the new $45 REAL-ID fee (Jan 2026). Factual policy description; any comments about “travellers may balk” are opinions. Relevance: small potential drag on demand (~6 % of travellers affected), but the fee took effect 1 Feb and no traffic dip is yet visible in TSA numbers.  
4. BBC story on a partial DHS shutdown that started 15 Feb 2026. Mostly factual.  TSA screeners are “essential” employees and still report to work, so throughput historically falls <1 % during very short shutdowns. Opinions from Airlines for America about “possible delays” are speculative; little evidence they depress passenger demand in real time.  
5. Kieran Healy blogpost on aggregation methods (Feb 2025). Methodological, no forward-looking claims.  Quality high but of limited direct relevance.  
6. CBP press release (Feb 2025). Unrelated to airline passenger volumes; ignored.  
7. Agent report (15 Feb 2026). Accurately notes the missing 13–15 Feb data and that TSA has issued no forecast. Useful synthesis, but not an original data source.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• Same calendar week in prior pre-COVID years (2019).  
• Same calendar week last year (10–16 Feb 2025).  
• The immediately preceding week (2–8 Feb 2026).  
The strongest predictor of very-near-term TSA throughput is the previous week’s pattern, adjusted by systematic weekday effects and short-term growth trend.  Year-ago comparison is useful for growth rate but less for level because 2025 volumes were ~20 % lower.  I therefore choose “the immediately preceding week, scaled by observed week-over-week growth” as the primary reference class and use 2025 only to sanity-check the implied YoY growth rate.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
We are forecasting three missing days (Fri–Sun) that will be reported within 1–3 days.  In the past five years, the standard deviation of daily TSA counts in the absence of major storms is ≈0.18 M passengers; a three-day sum therefore has σ ≈0.31 M.  Outlier shocks (large winter storms, mass cancellations, terrorist events, early-COVID-type collapse) are rare—perhaps 1–2 % of weeks—so fat tails will be added but not dominate.

(d) Justification  
1. Published figures for Mon–Thu 9–12 Feb 2026 = 9.015 M.  
2. Week-earlier pattern (2–8 Feb 2026): Fri 2.351 M, Sat 1.874 M, Sun 2.275 M, total 6.500 M.  
3. Growth seen so far this week vs same weekday last week:  
   Mon +11 %, Tue +11 %, Wed +13 %, Thu +16 %; average +13 %.  
4. Apply +13 % to last week’s Fri–Sun figures → expected Fri 2.656 M, Sat 2.118 M, Sun 2.595 M; subtotal 7.369 M.  
5. Baseline weekly total = 9.015 M + 7.369 M = 16.38 M passengers.  
6. Upside factors: start of Presidents-Day holiday (slight bump on Fri & Sun), continuing 20 % YoY recovery trend.  
7. Downside factors: winter weather risk (~10 % chance of a broad cancellation day), minimal deterrent from the REAL-ID fee, potential but historically tiny (<1 %) disruption from first day of a shutdown.  
8. Combine by assigning a normal-ish core (μ ≈16.3 M, σ ≈0.7 M) plus 5 % probability mass in each tail for shocks that could shift totals by ±1.5 M.

Outside view calibration:
• Historical weekly totals for this mid-February slot: 2019 ≈ 12.4 M, 2024 ≈ 13.2 M, 2025 ≈ 14.0 M.  Our median (≈16 M) implies YoY +15 %, consistent with the rolling average already reported (+21 % as of 8 Feb, which will soften slightly as 2025 comparison week also included the Presidents-Day surge).  
• I anchor the distribution to a central 50 % band of width 1.3 M (roughly ±0.65 M) and stretch another ~1.5 M on either side for the 10th/90th percentiles to respect low-frequency weather/shutdown surprises.  
• Percentiles are strictly increasing and extend beyond the platform’s 12–17 M hint range because both tails remain plausible.
