# Summary of Article: "TSA Screening Volume and Epiweeks"

**Source:** Kieran Healy (blog post)

## Key Facts and Information:

1. **TSA Data Availability:** The TSA makes daily checkpoint counts available back to January 2019 on its website. The author notes that more historical data may be available elsewhere.

2. **COVID-19 Impact:** The article presents a six-year daily time-series of TSA screening volumes that clearly shows the dramatic impact of COVID-19 on air travel, with a visible collapse in passenger volumes during the pandemic period.

3. **Data Characteristics:** 
   - The data shows fine-grain patterns including periodic fluctuations between workday vs. weekend travel
   - Different travel rates are visible for different days of the week

4. **Technical Methodology - Aggregating Weekly Data:**
   - When aggregating daily data into weekly totals, there's a technical challenge with how to handle partial weeks at year boundaries
   - Using standard calendar weeks creates artificial "craters" in the data when weeks at year-end have fewer than 7 days
   - **Solution:** Use CDC's Epidemiological Week (epiweek) standard, which ensures every week has exactly 7 days
   - Epiweeks start on Sunday (vs. ISO weeks which start on Monday)
   - The first epiweek of the year ends on the first Saturday of January, as long as that day falls at least four days into the month
   - This method borrows days from adjacent years to maintain consistent 7-day weeks

5. **Comparison Context:** The author notes that NYC Subway has higher daily throughput than every TSA Airport in the United States combined, and that subway ridership remains down from pre-COVID levels.

**Note:** This article is primarily methodological, explaining how to properly aggregate TSA daily screening data into weekly totals. It does not contain forecasts or predictions about future passenger volumes.

# Summary of Article: "Still don't have a REAL ID? Get ready for a $45 fee"

**Source:** CNN  
**Date:** January 23, 2026  
**Author:** Alexandra Skores

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **REAL ID Enforcement Timeline:**
   - TSA began enforcement of REAL ID requirements in May 2025
   - Starting February 1, 2026, travelers without a REAL ID will face a $45 fee to board domestic US flights
   - The REAL ID Act was originally passed by Congress in 2005

2. **Current Compliance Rates:**
   - Approximately 94% of passengers currently have a REAL ID-compliant driver's license or acceptable alternative ID (like a passport)
   - About 6% of passengers do not have compliant identification

3. **TSA Confirm ID Process:**
   - The $45 fee is valid for 10 days from the travel start date
   - The fee is non-refundable
   - The identification verification process takes an average of 10-15 minutes, but could take 30 minutes or more
   - Travelers can pay online before arriving at the airport or at the checkpoint (though paying at the airport means losing their place in line)

4. **Acceptable Alternative IDs:**
   - Passports
   - Military IDs
   - DHS trusted traveler cards
   - Permanent resident cards
   - Border crossing cards
   - Foreign government-issued passports
   - Mobile IDs

5. **Age Requirements:**
   - ID requirements apply to travelers 18 years or older
   - Children under 18 do not require ID for domestic flights

## Named Source Opinion:

**Steve Lorincz, Deputy Executive Assistant Administrator of TSA**, provided details about the policy implementation and encouraged travelers without REAL ID to obtain one from DMVs or Secretary of State offices rather than relying on the temporary $45 fee option for future travel.

# Summary of Article: "Flying without a Real ID? You may owe $45 — or more — starting Feb. 1"

**Source:** CNBC  
**Date:** January 31, 2026  
**Author:** Greg Iacurci

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **New Fee Implementation:** Starting February 1, 2026, travelers ages 18+ without a Real ID or acceptable travel document must pay $45 to use TSA's alternative identity verification system (TSA Confirm ID) to board domestic flights.

2. **Real ID Compliance Rate:** Approximately 6% of travelers don't have a Real ID or other acceptable form of identification, according to TSA (December announcement).

3. **Fee Validity Period:** The $45 TSA Confirm ID verification is valid for a 10-day travel period. Travelers on trips longer than 10 days would need to pay again (potentially $90 total for a two-week trip).

4. **Processing Time:** The Confirm ID process can take up to 30 minutes, potentially causing delays and missed flights if not completed in advance.

5. **Revenue Projections:** TSA estimates the Confirm ID program will be used approximately 10.6 million times over the next five years, generating about $476 million in revenue to offset administrative costs.

6. **Fee Change:** TSA initially estimated (November 13 report) an $18 fee, but this increased to $45 by the final December 2 announcement. The agency did not specify why the estimate changed.

7. **Real ID Background:** The Real ID Act was passed by Congress in 2005, establishing minimum security standards for state-issued IDs following the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. The federal requirement to have Real ID for domestic flights became effective May 7, 2025.

## Named Source Opinions:

- **John Breyault** (Vice President of Public Policy, National Consumers League): Characterized the fee as significant ("That's not nothing"), understands the fee as a compliance motivation mechanism, but notes the burden falls hardest on low- to moderate-income travelers and families with older children.

- **Sally French** (Travel expert at NerdWallet): Describes this as "really an enforcement mechanism" and "a real penalty for travelers who arrive unprepared."

- **Adam Stahl** (Senior official performing duties of deputy TSA administrator): Stated the fee ensures "non-compliant travelers, not taxpayers, cover the cost of processing travelers without acceptable IDs."

## Additional Context:

- Children under 18 don't require identification for domestic U.S. travel through TSA
- Real ID costs vary by state (example: $35 in New Jersey)
- TSA plans to reevaluate fee structure every two years

# Summary of Article: "Partial US government shutdown could mean airport delays, travel groups say"

**Source:** BBC  
**Date:** February 14, 2026

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Shutdown Details:**
   - A partial US government shutdown began at midnight (05:00 GMT) on Saturday, February 15, 2026
   - The shutdown occurred after Congress failed to pass a bill to fund Department of Homeland Security (DHS) operations
   - The most recent funding measure passed at the end of January only funded DHS for two weeks

2. **Affected Agencies:**
   - Transportation Security Administration (TSA) - may have workers going without pay
   - US Coast Guard - approximately 56,000 workers could go without pay according to Vice Admiral Thomas Allan
   - US Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) - will NOT be significantly affected due to funding from the "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" from last year

3. **Available Funding:**
   - DHS has $165 billion (£120 billion) from Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act that could be used to address funding shortfalls
   - The Act also included $75 billion to fund ICE
   - The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has already been funded for the rest of the year

4. **Congressional Timeline:**
   - Congress is set to take a recess until February 23, 2026
   - Trump's State of the Union address is scheduled for February 24, 2026

## Opinions from Named/Reliable Sources:

- **Airlines for America (joint statement with other travel groups):** Warned that without a deal, the risk of unscheduled absences by TSA workers increases, causing flight delays and longer wait times. Stated: "Travellers and the US economy cannot afford to have essential TSA personnel working without pay."

- **Vice Admiral Thomas Allan:** Told lawmakers that going a few days without funding would mean about 56,000 Coast Guard workers going without pay, leading the agency to suspend non-critical or non-lifesaving missions.

- **President Donald Trump:** When asked about cutting a deal with Democrats, said "we'll see what happens" and added "We always have to protect our law enforcement."

## Context:

- The partial shutdown is described as "unlikely to cause as much travel chaos as last year's" because the FAA has already been funded
- Last year saw the longest full government shutdown in US history at 43 days, which led to federal workers going without pay and flight chaos
- The current political dispute centers on Democratic demands for immigration reforms within DHS following the deaths of two Minneapolis residents (Alex Pretti and Renee Good) killed by federal agents during immigration raid protests in January
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve TSA daily passenger volumes for February 9-15 in years 2019-2025 and list weekly totals with year-over-year percentages. Also note any TSA forecast statements for Feb 9-15 2026.
Scope of the request  
1. Daily TSA checkpoint throughput for every year 2019-2025 covering the seven-day span Monday Feb 9 through Sunday Feb 15.  
2. For each year: add the seven numbers to obtain a weekly total, then calculate the year-over-year (YoY) percentage change vs. the prior year.  
3. Locate any TSA statement that explicitly forecasts, projects, or otherwise gives an expectation for passenger volume during 9-15 Feb 2026.

What the current search results do – and do not – provide  

A.  Actual daily numbers  
•  We retrieved one excerpt of the TSA’s live “checkpoint travel numbers” table, but it only lists dates in January–February 2026 (2 Feb – 12 Feb 2026) (TSA.gov “checkpoint travel numbers”).  
•  No rows for 2019-2025 are shown in the snippet, even though the live table normally includes those historical comparators.  
•  The DHS “COVID-19 Passenger Throughput” dataset referenced on Data.gov is listed, but the raw CSV/JSON file was not opened, so the underlying 2019-2025 datapoints were not captured.  

B.  Forecast information  
•  None of the press releases or news clippings returned mention a TSA forecast for the specific mid-February 2026 week.  
  –  A December-2025 article cites a TSA forecast for the 19 Dec 2025 – 4 Jan 2026 holiday window (VisaHQ, 22 Dec 2025), but that period ends more than a month before the target dates.  
  –  No TSA press release dated late-January or early-February 2026 covering Presidents-Day travel (which would encompass 9-15 Feb 2026) appeared in the search results.

Consequences for the deliverable  
•  Because the seven daily figures for each of the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024, and 2025 are missing, we cannot yet compute weekly totals or YoY percentages.  
•  Because the TSA has released no publicly located forecast for 9-15 Feb 2026, that portion likewise remains unanswerable from the evidence gathered so far.

Information gaps that must still be closed  
1.  Download or scrape the historical columns of the TSA checkpoint table (or the Data.gov “COVID-19 Passenger Throughput” CSV) to pull the following 49 daily figures:  
      •  Feb 9-15 2019  
      •  Feb 9-15 2020  
      •  Feb 9-15 2021  
      •  Feb 9-15 2022  
      •  Feb 9-15 2023  
      •  Feb 9-15 2024  
      •  Feb 9-15 2025  
2.  Verify completeness for 2026 (at minimum add 13-15 Feb 2026, which were not in the initial snippet).  
3.  Search TSA press releases issued between 20 Jan 2026 and 15 Feb 2026 for the words “forecast,” “expects,” “President’s Day,” “holiday travel,” or “February,” to confirm definitively whether any forward-looking statement exists for that week.

Recommended next search actions  
•  Pull the CSV from Data.gov – it usually contains Date, 2024, 2023, 2022, 2021, 2020, 2019 columns.  
•  If Data.gov fails, scrape TSA’s web table directly (each row shows the same-calendar-day counts for all years).  
•  Conduct focused press-release searches on the TSA site for late-January / early-February 2026.

Until those steps are completed, the requested table of weekly totals and YoY changes, as well as the note on any TSA forecast for 9-15 Feb 2026, cannot yet be produced.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
