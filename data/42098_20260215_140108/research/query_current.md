Analysis:
To estimate the total TSA‐screened passengers for 9–15 Feb 2026, I first need the most recent daily checkpoint numbers already posted (typically available through 14 Feb) and any credible projections or news coverage for Sun 15 Feb (which coincides with Presidents Day weekend travel). Therefore, the most relevant material will be: 1) the TSA “Daily Checkpoint Travel Numbers” table, 2) recent articles or press releases citing those figures or forecasting the holiday weekend surge, and 3) aviation/business news discussing February 2026 travel demand trends or expected records. The queries below should surface these pieces of information.
