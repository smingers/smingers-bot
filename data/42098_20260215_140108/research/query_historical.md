Analysis:
To estimate the 7-day TSA passenger total for 9–15 Feb 2026, the most useful context is:  
• How many passengers were screened in the corresponding week in prior years (2019-2025).  
• Recent growth rates (especially 2024→2025) and any news about expected record traffic around the Presidents Day/Valentine’s Day weekend of 2026.  
The TSA publishes historical daily counts on its website, and news outlets often quote TSA forecasts for upcoming holiday weekends. Therefore I need: (1) the TSA table for mid-February 2025 and earlier; (2) news articles giving the TSA’s or airlines’ 2026 holiday-week forecasts. An Agent query can pull a block of daily numbers across several years so I can calculate weekly totals and growth trends.
