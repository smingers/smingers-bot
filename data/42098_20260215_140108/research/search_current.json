Approximately 13,200 air traffic controllers expected to remain on the job without pay\n   - More than 61,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) employees expected to continue working without pay\n   - About 63,000 Customs and Border Protection workers would still report to work\n\n3. **Existing Staffing Shortages:**\n   - FAA facing a shortage of about 3,000 air traffic controllers\n   - Current air traffic controller staffing at 10,800, compared to the needed 14,633 (lowest staffing in decades)\n\n4. **Historical Reference - 2018-2019 Shutdown:**\n   - Lasted 35 days during Trump's first term (longest shutdown ever)\n   - About three weeks into that shutdown, unpaid security screeners started calling in sick\n   - Miami International Airport temporarily closed one terminal due to TSA officers calling in sick at twice the usual rate\n   - Controllers in busiest facilities reported working up to 60 hours per week\n   - Increasing number of TSA agents quit their jobs\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n1. **Geoff Freeman, President and CEO of U.S. Travel Association:** Warned that \"The longer a shutdown drags on, the more likely we are to see longer TSA lines, flight delays and cancellations, national parks in disrepair and unnecessary delays in modernizing travel infrastructure.\"\n\n2. **Jeffrey Price, Professor of Aviation at Metropolitan State University of Denver:** \n   - \"The system does become a little bit more brittle, and the longer this goes, the more the traveler is going to notice it\"\n   - \"This is more than just an inconvenience to the traveler. This is definitely going to bring up safety and security issues, if it really starts to go into the long term.\"\n\n3. **Nick Daniels, President of the union representing air traffic controllers:** Said a shutdown weakens the aviation safety system by adding stress on controllers and taking away support workers who maintain the outdated system. Noted controllers are \"working with unreliable equipment.\"\n\n## Other Relevant Information:\n\n- Travelers can still fly despite the shutdown, and early on might not notice issues\n- As time passes without paychecks, travelers could see longer security lines and flight interruptions\n- National Parks remain mostly open, with roads, lookouts, trails, and open-air memorials generally accessible\n- Smithsonian museums and National Zoo scheduled to stay open through at least October 6, 2025\n- Amtrak trains continue running\n- Ports of entry remain open for international travelers\n\n**Relevance to Forecasting Question:** This article describes a government shutdown occurring in October 2025 that could affect TSA operations and staffing. The historical precedent from the 2018-2019 shutdown and the current staffing shortages could potentially impact passenger screening volumes in February 2026 if the shutdown is prolonged or has lasting effects on TSA workforce retention.\n</Summary>\n\n<Asknews_articles>\nQuery: What will US airline passenger volume be for these weeks in February 2026, according to the TSA?

Approximately 95% of TSA officers are deemed essential and are required to work without pay until a funding agreement is reached. Unlike the previous 43-day shutdown in 2025, the rest of the federal government remains funded through September 30, 2026, ensuring air traffic controllers continue to receive pay, reducing the risk of widespread flight cancellations. However, experts warn that the current shutdown could lead to longer security lines and potential flight delays due to reduced TSA staffing, especially at smaller airports with limited checkpoints. Travelers are advised to arrive early, check real-time security wait times on airport websites, avoid prohibited items in carry-on bags (such as full-size liquids, gels, aerosols, and pocketknives), and practice patience, as TSA agents are working without pay and under stress. The shutdown persists due to a legislative impasse: Democrats in Congress are demanding new restrictions on federal immigration operations following the fatal shootings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis, which they link to immigration policy. The White House has been negotiating but failed to reach a deal before lawmakers departed for a 10-day break, with a return to Washington expected if a resolution is reached. Industry groups including U.S. Travel, Airlines for America, and the American Hotel & Lodging Association issued a joint statement warning that essential TSA personnel working without pay increases the risk of unscheduled absences, longer wait times, and missed or delayed flights, especially as the spring break travel season approaches.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 05:47 AM\nSource:[texarkanagazette.com](https://www.texarkanagazette.com/news/2026/feb/14/tsa-agents-are-working-without-pay-at-us-airports/)\n\n**TSA Workers Continue Without Pay During U.S. Government Shutdown, Prompting Concerns Over Security Lines and Flight Delays - Travel And Tour World**\nThe U.S. government shutdown, which began on Saturday, February 14, 2026, after funding for the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) expired, has left TSA officers working without pay despite being deemed essential personnel. This situation mirrors the 43-day shutdown in 2024, which caused widespread flight cancellations, long security lines, and airport disruptions, including the temporary closure of two security checkpoints at Philadelphia International Airport. Experts, including John Rose, Chief Risk Officer at Altour, and Rich Davis, senior security advisor at International SOS, warn that the current shutdown may lead to similar or worse disruptions, including longer wait times, delayed luggage processing, and flight delays due to airlines postponing departures to ensure passengers clear security. Travelers are advised to plan ahead, allow extra time, avoid prohibited items in carry-ons, and not rely solely on real-time wait time updates. The U.S. Travel Association, Airlines for America, and the American Hotel & Lodging Association have jointly warned that the shutdown poses a serious threat to air travel during the peak spring break season. The deadlock stems from Democratic lawmakers refusing to approve DHS funding without new immigration restrictions, halting negotiations. As of the article\u2019s publication, no resolution had been reached, and lawmakers warned they might return early if a deal is made. TSA officers are under increased pressure, working without compensation, reduced staffing, and facing frustrated travelers, highlighting the fragility of federal funding and its direct impact on national security and travel infrastructure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 09:05 PM\nSource:[Travel And Tour World](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/tsa-workers-continue-without-pay-during-u-s-government-shutdown-prompting-concerns-over-security-lines-and-flight-delays/)\n\n**Not Again: 50,000 TSA Officers Face Unpaid Work As Shutdown Threatens Spring Break Travel**\nA partial government shutdown of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) began on Friday, February 13, 2026, after funding expired at midnight, affecting approximately 50,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers who are deemed essential personnel but will work without pay. Unlike the 43-day shutdown in 2024, which impacted air traffic controllers and led to widespread flight cancellations, air traffic controllers will continue receiving pay because the rest of the federal government is funded through September 30, 2026. However, TSA workers\u201495% of whom are essential\u2014must continue working without compensation, raising concerns about unscheduled absences, increased call-outs, and longer security lines. The U.S. Travel Association, Airlines for America, and the American Hotel & Lodging Association jointly warned that unpaid work risks disrupting travel, citing potential delays and missed flights. Negotiations between the White House and Democratic lawmakers have stalled, with Democrats refusing to approve DHS funding unless new restrictions on federal immigration operations are included. Democrats have presented ten demands, including body cameras (bipartisan) and a ban on masks to conceal identity (controversial), while Republicans\u2019 attempt to pass a short-term funding extension was blocked by Democrats, who labeled it 'insufficient and complete.' Passengers are advised to arrive at airports 1\u20132 hours early, prepare carry-ons by removing liquids/gels into clear bags, keeping laptops accessible, removing shoes, and emptying pockets. Enrolled travelers in TSA PreCheck, Global Entry, or CLEAR may bypass certain screening steps, but others must follow all security instructions and review prohibited items to avoid delays.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 08:05 PM\nSource:[Simple Flying](https://simpleflying.com/not-again-tsa-officers-unpaid-shutdown-spring-break/)\n\n**Partial government shutdown forces TSA agents to work without pay at airports**\nA partial government shutdown of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) began at dawn on Saturday, February 14, 2026, directly impacting the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which is responsible for screening passengers and baggage at airports nationwide. According to The Associated Press (AP), TSA agents are required to continue working without pay during ongoing congressional negotiations to fund DHS. This situation echoes the 43-day government shutdown that caused mass cancellations and long airport lines. While the current scenario may differ, experts warn that impacts could emerge more quickly this time, as workers still remember the recent crisis. Unlike previous shutdowns, most of the federal government remains funded through September 30, 2026, so air traffic controllers will continue receiving salaries, reducing the risk of widespread flight cancellations. However, approximately 95% of TSA personnel are deemed essential and must work without pay. Democratic lawmakers have tied DHS funding to new restrictions on federal immigration policy, complicating a swift resolution. In past shutdowns, airport disruptions were not immediate but developed over time. Experts now believe delays may appear faster due to heightened worker fatigue and memory of recent strain. Even minor absences of TSA agents could cause long lines, especially at smaller airports. Airlines may delay departures to wait for passengers still undergoing security checks. Tourism and airline associations warn that a prolonged shutdown could increase the risk of delays, missed flights, and longer wait times, particularly during the spring travel season. Experts recommend arriving at the airport earlier than usual, checking real-time wait times online, and packing appropriately to avoid additional screenings.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 04:42 PM\nSource:[Univision](https://www.univision.com/noticias/estados-unidos/cierre-parcial-gobierno-obliga-a-agentes-de-la-tsa-a-laborar-sin-sueldo-en-aeropuertos)\n\n**US Travel Disruption Alert: TSA Screeners Hold Security Lines Amid Shutdown With No Pay - Travel And Tour World**\nA partial United States government shutdown began on February 14, 2026, after Congress failed to pass an appropriations bill, causing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding to lapse. As a result, essential personnel, including 95% of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents, are required to continue working at major U.S. airports without pay until funding is restored. Federal law mandates retroactive pay once appropriations are approved. This situation threatens airport security operations, with major airlines and travel associations warning that unpaid work could lead to increased absenteeism, longer security wait times, and potential delays\u2014especially during peak travel periods like spring break. Although air traffic controllers remain paid and operational, the stress on TSA staffing could still cause localized delays and congestion. Historical precedent from the 2018\u201319 shutdown shows that many TSA agents called out sick during unpaid periods, contributing to long lines. Analysts recommend travelers arrive two to three hours before domestic flights and even earlier for international departures, monitor real-time wait times via apps, and consider flexible tickets or travel insurance. The shutdown affects only DHS functions, with most other federal agencies remaining funded through September 2026. The ongoing situation poses a significant risk to travel efficiency and passenger experience during a high-demand travel season.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 04:00 PM\nSource:[Travel And Tour World](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/us-travel-disruption-alert-tsa-screeners-hold-security-lines-amid-shutdown-with-no-pay/)\n\n**TSA agents are working without pay at U.S. airports due to another partial government shutdown**\nA partial government shutdown of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), effective early Saturday, 2026, has impacted the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which is responsible for screening passengers and baggage at airports nationwide. TSA agents are working without pay amid a lack of agreement on DHS' annual funding, similar to the 43-day shutdown in 2024 that caused historic flight cancellations and long delays. Although TSA officers previously worked through the record shutdown that ended on November 12, 2024, aviation experts suggest this current shutdown may unfold differently.

With TSA employees being required to work without pay, flight delays and longer security screening times have increased, raising concerns about operational efficiency and passenger safety. Travel groups and airlines have issued joint warnings about the risks of unscheduled absences among TSA agents, which could severely impact air travel. The shutdown affects multiple DHS agencies, including the TSA and the U.S. Coast Guard, though the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) remains funded for the year, helping to mitigate some air traffic control issues. The Coast Guard could suspend non-essential missions if funding remains unavailable, affecting around 56,000 workers. While ICE continues operating under the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' which allocated $75 billion for its operations, the broader funding deadlock has stalled immigration-related reforms. Lawmakers have blocked recent funding bills over demands for stricter immigration enforcement, including bans on face masks for agents and enhanced warrant procedures. The shutdown is expected to persist until at least the State of the Union address on February 24, 2026, with Congress possibly reconvening earlier if negotiations progress. The DHS holds $165 billion in available funds, but uncertainty over budget negotiations continues to threaten travel efficiency, security, and public confidence in the U.S. transportation system.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 07:19 AM\nSource:[Travel And Tour World](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/u-s-airports-in-crisis-as-government-shutdown-forces-tsa-employees-to-work-without-pay-leading-to-widespread-flight-delays-and-security-challenges/)\n\n**Airlines, travel groups warn of impact of partial US government shutdown on airport screeners - The Economic Times**\nMajor airlines and travel groups, including Airlines for America, U.S. Travel, and the American Hotel & Lodging Association, issued a joint warning on February 13, 2026, urging Congress to prevent a partial U.S. government shutdown.

On the busiest days\u2014February 13\u201314 (26th\u201327th of the twelfth lunar month) and February 22\u201323 (6th\u20137th of the first lunar month)\u2014the airport is forecast to handle up to 1,027 flights per day, with aircraft taking off or landing every minute. Average daily passenger volume is projected at 145,000, peaking at around 165,000 on the busiest single day. This represents an 8% year-on-year increase in passenger numbers and a 7% increase in daily flights compared to Tet 2025. The Southern Airports Authority emphasized that the new domestic Terminal T3 will be operational during Tet 2026, serving six airlines: Vietnam Airlines, Pacific Airlines, Bamboo Airways, Vietravel Airlines, Vasco, and Sun PhuQuoc Airways. Vietjet will continue operating from Terminal T1, while Terminal T2 will remain dedicated to international flights. Tran Van Hoach, Head of the Department for Aviation Service Quality and Transport Supervision, urged travelers to verify their terminal information to avoid confusion. The authority has implemented coordination plans with the Ministry of Construction, Civil Aviation Authority of Vietnam, and Ho Chi Minh City Department of Construction to ensure security, traffic safety, and smooth passenger flow, including early slot allocation and enhanced ground service staffing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 05:50 PM\nSource:[VietNamNet News](https://vietnamnet.vn/en/southern-airports-authority-issues-key-advice-for-tet-travelers-at-tan-son-nhat-2488331.html)\n\n**IATA Forecast 2026: US Air Travel vs. Global Aviation Growth - Travel And Tour World**\nAccording to Willie Walsh, Director General of the International Air Transport Association (IATA), global air travel is entering a 'Golden Era' of growth, with a projected 4.9% increase in passenger demand in 2026, reaching a record 5.2 billion passengers worldwide. This surge is driven by strong growth in the Asia-Pacific region and a resilient European market. However, the U.S. market is expected to remain 'broadly flat,' marking a significant divergence from global trends. Walsh attributes this stagnation to a 'perfect storm' of factors, including heightened political tensions\u2014such as threats to decertify Canadian-made Bombardier aircraft over Gulfstream jet certification disputes\u2014and the impact of a 43-day government shutdown that caused severe staffing shortages among air traffic controllers and TSA agents. This, combined with a historic January 2026 winter storm that disrupted air travel on a scale comparable to the COVID-19 pandemic, has left major U.S. airlines like Delta, United, and American in 'recovery mode.' Despite a projected record $41 billion in global net airline profits, the benefits are unevenly distributed, with the U.S. notably absent from the growth. Walsh cautioned that the U.S. is 'unlikely to catch up in the near future,' citing unresolved Boeing and Airbus delivery backlogs exceeding 17,000 aircraft and the need for reduced trade tensions and improved international tourism appeal. The stagnation manifests for travelers as higher ticket prices, fewer flight options to mid-sized cities, and increased friction at airports.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 07:07 PM\nSource:[Travel And Tour World](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/iata-forecast-2026-us-air-travel-vs-global-aviation-growth/)\n\n**2026 Spring Festival Travel Season Begins: Record-Breaking 9.5 Billion Person-Trips Expected**\nThe 2026 Spring Festival Travel Season began on February 2, 2026, and will last 40 days until March 13, 2026.

The busiest airports include Guangzhou Baiyun, Shanghai Pudong, Shenzhen Bao'an, Beijing Capital, and Chengdu Tianfu. The most in-demand routes are Shanghai Hongqiao\u2013Shenzhen Bao'an, Hangzhou Xiaoshan\u2013Shenzhen Bao'an, Shanghai Hongqiao\u2013Guangzhou Baiyun, Hangzhou Xiaoshan\u2013Guangzhou Baiyun, and Shenzhen Bao'an\u2013Beijing Capital. According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) Operations Monitoring Center, the 2026 Spring Festival holiday will be the longest in history, lasting nine days, which is expected to significantly boost long-distance travel demand. As a result, air travel demand will be exceptionally high, with peak flight volumes lasting longer and reaching higher levels than in previous years. Daily flight volume is projected to reach approximately 20,000 during the week before the festival, and during the holiday period (excluding Chinese New Year's Eve and the first day of the Lunar New Year), daily flights may average 19,500, an increase of about 1,000 flights compared to the previous year. Domestically, hub airports such as Guangzhou Baiyun, Chengdu Tianfu, and Hangzhou Xiaoshan saw flight volume increases of about 15%, while flights between Beijing Capital, Guangzhou Baiyun, Shenzhen Bao'an, and Hangzhou Xiaoshan increased by over 25%. Internationally, China-Thailand and China-South Korea passenger flights averaged over 300 daily flights, leading all international routes. Flight volume increases were most significant on routes to Indonesia, Vietnam, Russia, and Malaysia. On the first day of the travel season, weather across China was generally favorable, with clear to partly cloudy conditions nationwide. However, frequent cold fronts are expected, with snow affecting northern Xinjiang, North China, Northeast China, northern Central China, and northern East China. Low visibility due to snowmelt fog is anticipated in northern Xinjiang from late February to March, particularly impacting Urumqi Airport. Additionally, convective weather is expected in parts of Yunnan-Guizhou, central-southern Central China, and central-southern East China from late February to March. The 2026 Spring Festival travel season runs from February 2 to March 13, with an estimated 95 million passengers transported, averaging 2.38 million passengers per day and 19,400 flights daily. To manage the increased demand, civil aviation authorities have prepared in advance with optimized flight scheduling, equipment maintenance, personnel and supply reserves. The civil aviation meteorological department will enhance weather monitoring and issue timely forecasts and warnings for adverse weather, enabling scientific flight adjustments. Airlines and airports will use multiple channels to disseminate flight information, ensuring passengers receive timely and accurate updates.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51](https://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2026/0202/c1004-40658135.html)\n\n**2026 Civil Aviation Spring Festival Travel Season Passenger Volume Expected to Reach 95 Million**\nThe Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced on January 19, 2026, that the 2026 Spring Festival travel season will run from February 2 to March 13, lasting 40 days. The CAAC forecasts that the total passenger volume for the period will reach approximately 95 million trips, averaging 2.38 million passengers per day\u2014setting a new historical record. According to Wang Weijun, Deputy Director of the CAAC's Transport Department, rising interest in flight bookings is driven by the integration of aviation, tourism, and culture, extended holidays, and relaxed entry/exit policies. Popular routes include northern winter snow tourism and southern warm-weather getaways, with both outbound and inbound travel expected to see new peaks. Due to the late timing of the Lunar New Year, post-holiday return travel for students and working professionals is expected to be highly concentrated, with a projected single-day peak of 2.6 million passengers. To meet demand, the CAAC has coordinated with industry stakeholders to optimize flight scheduling, increasing capacity to major hub airports and tourist destinations domestically, and enhancing international routes\u2014especially to neighboring countries and key inbound tourism markets. Airlines are encouraged to develop 'direct connection through trunk and feeder routes' and air-rail intermodal services to expand travel options. Passenger service improvements include enhanced inter-departmental and inter-regional coordination, refined traffic management, and a commitment to maintaining a high flight normalcy rate. Airlines are also required to implement 'integrated service and operations' standards, ensuring timely updates on flight delays and efficient ticket refund and rescheduling processes. Special attention is being given to the needs of elderly, child, disabled, and first-time travelers, with service procedures being optimized and details refined to improve accessibility and comfort.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 01:20 AM\nSource:[china.org.cn/china.com.cn(\u4e2d\u56fd\u7f51)](http://travel.china.com.cn/txt/2026-01/20/content_118289242.shtml)\n\n**China's Civil Aviation Spring Festival Travel Season Passenger Volume Expected to Reach Record High in 2026**\nAccording to a press conference held by the Civil Aviation Administration of China on January 19, 2026, the civil aviation passenger transport volume during this year's Spring Festival travel season is expected to reach 95 million passengers, averaging 2.38 million passengers per day, representing a 5.3% year-on-year increase. The 2026 Spring Festival travel season runs from February 2 to March 13, lasting 40 days. The Deputy Director of the Transport Department, Wang Weijun, highlighted four key characteristics of this year's\u6625\u8fd0: first, passenger volume is expected to set a new record; second, two peak travel periods are anticipated, particularly after the late Chinese New Year, with a single-day peak potentially reaching 2.6 million passengers; third, tourism demand is rising, driven by integrated aviation-tourism initiatives, extended holidays, and eased outbound/inbound travel policies, with increased interest in northern winter sports and southern warm-weather destinations, and a surge expected in both outbound and inbound flights; fourth, complex weather conditions such as rain, snow, and ice may pose significant operational challenges, requiring enhanced coordination among airlines, airports, and air traffic control. The Civil Aviation Administration has proactively assessed market conditions, conducted route and schedule reviews, and allocated temporary flight slots. Domestic flights will focus on increasing capacity to major hubs and tourist destinations, while international flights will prioritize key regional routes and inbound tourism markets. The administration also encourages airlines to develop 'direct-to-connection' domestic through-flights and air-rail integration services to diversify travel options. Based on preliminary flight plans, a total of 780,000 flights are expected during the season, averaging 19,400 flights per day\u2014a 5% increase from last year\u2014ensuring strong support for passenger travel needs.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51](https://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2026/0120/c1004-40648875.html)\n\n**Airport Traffic Hits US Record Sunday After Thanksgiving: Will Airline Stocks Take Flight Into 2026? - U.S. Global Jets ETF (ARCA:JETS)**\nOn November 30, 2025, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) recorded a new U.S. airport screening record, with 3,133,924 passengers screened\u2014surpassing the previous high of 3,096,797 set on June 22, 2025. This marked the highest number of passengers ever screened in a single day in TSA history. All 10 of the busiest travel days in U.S. history have occurred in 2024 or 2025, with the top 10 listed by date and passenger count. The surge in travel followed the Thanksgiving holiday, during which over 18 million passengers were screened between November 25 and December 1, 2025. The record-breaking traffic comes less than a month after the 43-day federal government shutdown, which disrupted air travel due to unpaid air traffic controllers and other personnel. Despite potential quarterly earnings weakness from airlines like American Airlines (AAL), Delta (DAL), United (UAL), and Southwest (LUV) due to the shutdown, the high passenger volume could help offset losses. The U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS), which holds these four airlines as its largest constituents, rose 1.71% to $26.65 on December 2, 2025, approaching its 52-week high from January 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 11:57 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/25/12/49175595/airport-traffic-hits-us-record-sunday-after-thanksgiving-will-airline-stocks-take-flight-into-2026)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
