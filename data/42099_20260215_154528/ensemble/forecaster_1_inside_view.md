**Polymarket (Feb 22 single day):**
- Prediction market shows 56% probability of >2.6M passengers on Feb 22 alone
- Low volume ($109 total), limited reliability
- Suggests market expects strong Saturday volume

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE (Large negative impact):**
1. **Government shutdown forcing unpaid TSA work**: Multiple independent authoritative sources (industry associations, airlines, government officials) confirm 50,000 TSA agents working without pay starting Feb 14. Historical precedent from 2024 43-day shutdown caused "mass cancellations and long airport lines." Direct causal mechanism: unpaid workers → increased call-outs → longer security lines → passengers miss flights or avoid travel.

2. **California winter storm disrupting travel**: Multiple independent weather and news sources confirm major storm affecting major California airports (SFO, OAK, SJC) during Feb 15-17, with 15%+ flight cancellations already occurring. Direct impact on passenger volumes during first half of target week.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**
3. **Presidents Day weekend timing**: Feb 17 is Presidents Day holiday, typically a moderate travel period. Historical data shows this week had 16.7M passengers in 2024, 16.6M in 2025. Provides stable baseline but not exceptional demand driver.

4. **Early Feb 2026 momentum**: TSA data shows +13% to +21% YoY growth in first week of Feb 2026, suggesting strong underlying demand. However, this momentum may be disrupted by shutdown and storm.

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**
5. **Late 2025 deceleration**: December 2025 was flat YoY, but early 2026 shows rebound. Limited predictive power for mid-February.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 1-7 days ahead (Feb 16-22, 2026 from Feb 15, 2026)

This is an **extremely short-term forecast** with two major disruptions already in progress:
- Government shutdown began yesterday (Feb 14)
- Winter storm affecting California airports today and tomorrow (Feb 15-16)

**If timeframe were halved (3-4 days):** Would focus only on Feb 16-19, capturing full storm impact and initial shutdown effects. Confidence would be higher about negative impacts.

**If timeframe were doubled (14 days):** Would include Feb 23-March 1. Shutdown effects might worsen (more TSA call-outs), but storm would be past. Greater uncertainty about whether shutdown resolves or worsens.

**Key insight:** The extremely short timeframe means we're forecasting with two major disruptions **already underway**, not speculative future events. This is unusual and increases confidence in negative impact.

## (d) Justification

**Outside View Base Rate:** 16.66M (Feb 16-22, 2025) with early 2026 momentum suggesting +12-14% growth → ~18.7M median

**Critical Adjustments for Inside View:**

**Major Downward Factors:**
1. **Government shutdown impact**: The 2024 43-day shutdown caused "mass cancellations and long airport lines." Current shutdown began Feb 14, meaning TSA agents will work the entire target week without pay. Industry experts explicitly warn of "increased risk of unscheduled absences," "longer wait times," and "missed flights." Even if only 5-10% of TSA workforce calls out sick, this could reduce throughput by similar amounts at affected airports. **Impact estimate: -3% to -8% reduction in volumes.**

2. **California storm disruptions**: Northern California airports (SFO, OAK, SJC) handle ~150,000+ passengers daily combined. With 15%+ flight cancellations during Feb 15-17 (first 2 days of target week), this directly removes passengers. Storm also discourages discretionary travel. **Impact estimate: -1% to -3% reduction in national volumes.**

**Combined Effect:**
The shutdown and storm are **independent, simultaneous disruptions** affecting different mechanisms (TSA staffing vs. weather operations). Their effects compound rather than overlap. Combined impact: **-4% to -11% reduction** from what would otherwise be expected.

**Adjusted Forecast Logic:**
- Without disruptions, early 2026 momentum suggested ~18.7M (median, +12% over 2025)
- With -4% to -11% disruption impact: 18.7M × 0.89 to 0.96 = **16.6M to 17.9M**
- This brings forecast **back toward or below 2025 levels** despite strong underlying demand

**Distribution Shape:**
- **Lower tail risk**: If shutdown causes widespread TSA call-outs (like 2024) AND storm is worse than expected, could see -15% disruption → ~15.9M
- **Upper tail possibility**: If shutdown has minimal immediate impact (workers stay despite no pay) AND storm clears quickly, could still see modest growth → ~18.5M
- **Most likely**: Moderate disruption from both factors → 16.8M to 17.5M range

## Distribution Calibration

**Recalibrating from outside view:**

The outside view suggested 17.2M (10th) to 19.8M (90th) with 18.7M median, based on strong early 2026 momentum.

**Inside view adjustments:**
- Two major disruptions (shutdown + storm) are **factual, ongoing events**, not speculative
- Historical precedent shows shutdown can cause significant travel disruption
- Storm is affecting major airport hub during first 2-3 days of target week
- However, air traffic controllers remain paid (unlike 2024), limiting worst-case scenario

**Revised distribution:**
- **10th percentile**: Severe disruption scenario - widespread TSA call-outs + extended storm → ~15.8M (-5% vs 2025)
- **20th percentile**: Significant disruption - moderate TSA absences + storm impact → ~16.5M (-1% vs 2025)
- **40th percentile**: Moderate disruption - limited TSA impact + storm clears → ~17.2M (+3% vs 2025)
- **60th percentile**: Mild disruption - shutdown manageable + storm brief → ~17.7M (+6% vs 2025)
- **80th percentile**: Minimal disruption - strong demand overcomes issues → ~18.3M (+10% vs 2025)
- **90th percentile**: Disruptions overestimated - robust travel continues → ~18.8M (+13% vs 2025)

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Total TSA passengers screened Feb 16-22, 2026 (7-day period), measured in passengers.

2. **Base rate**: Outside view suggested 16.66M (2025 baseline) with +12-14% growth momentum → 18.7M median. Current forecast shifts significantly downward due to two major ongoing disruptions.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 17.45M; mean ≈ 17.5M. This represents +4.7% vs 2025, substantially below the +12-14% early 2026 momentum, justified by shutdown and storm disruptions.

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - TSA shutdown: 50,000 agents working unpaid starting Feb 14 (STRONG, negative)
   - California storm: 15%+ flight cancellations Feb 15-17 (STRONG, negative)
   - Early 2026 momentum: +13-21% YoY growth first week (MODERATE, positive)
   - Historical precedent: 2024 shutdown caused mass disruptions (MODERATE, negative)
   - Presidents Day weekend: Moderate travel period, 16.7M baseline (MODERATE, neutral)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: TSA workers demonstrate exceptional resilience and maintain near-100% attendance despite no pay, while storm clears faster than expected and pent-up demand surges. This would push outcome upward toward 19M+.

6. **Status quo**: 2025 same week was 16.66M. Given two major disruptions occurring during forecast period, slight downward bias from early 2026 momentum is appropriate. However, maintaining some upside recognizes underlying demand strength.

7. **Technicalities**: All values in passengers (no scientific notation), strictly increasing, within bounds (12M-17M stated, but extending beyond as supported by evidence).
