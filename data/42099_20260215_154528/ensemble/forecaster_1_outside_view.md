## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Same calendar week in prior years (Feb 16-22):**
   - 2024: 16,738,824 passengers
   - 2025: 16,664,702 passengers (-0.44%)
   - Most directly comparable timeframe
   - Controls for seasonal patterns and day-of-week effects
   - **Most suitable reference class**

2. **Adjacent weeks in February 2026:**
   - Feb 9-15, 2026: Can be estimated from available daily data
   - Feb 1-8, 2026: Partial data available showing strong YoY growth (+13% to +21%)
   - Useful for understanding current 2026 momentum

3. **Year-over-year growth trends:**
   - Early Feb 2026 vs Feb 2025: +13% to +21%
   - Full year 2025 vs 2024: +0.3% (very modest)
   - Dec 2025 vs Dec 2024: 0% (flat)
   - Shows deceleration through late 2025, but reacceleration in early 2026

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:**
- Target week: Feb 16-22, 2026 (Monday through Sunday)
- Current date: Feb 15, 2026
- Forecasting window: 1-7 days ahead (extremely short-term)

**Historical Patterns:**

The target week falls in mid-February, typically a moderate travel period between post-holiday lull and spring break. Key observations:

- **Feb 16-22, 2024:** 16.74M passengers
- **Feb 16-22, 2025:** 16.66M passengers (-0.44%)
- **Early Feb 2026 trend:** Strong YoY growth (+13% to +21% vs 2025)

The -0.44% decline from 2024 to 2025 contrasts sharply with the robust growth seen in early February 2026. This suggests 2025 was an anomalous weak year, while 2026 has returned to growth.

**Weekly Pattern Context:**
Early February 2026 (Feb 1-8) 7-day rolling average was ~14.48M passengers with +21% YoY growth. If this momentum continues into the target week, we'd expect significant growth over 2025's 16.66M.

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate from Historical Reference Class:**
The most direct baseline is the 16.66M passengers screened during Feb 16-22, 2025. However, several factors suggest adjustment:

**Upward Pressure:**
1. **Strong early 2026 momentum:** YoY growth of +13% to +21% in first week of Feb 2026
2. **Recovery from 2025 weakness:** Full year 2025 grew only 0.3%; 2026 appears to be rebounding
3. **Economic indicators:** Expert commentary suggests strong economy driving travel demand
4. **Summer 2025 strength:** Record-breaking days in mid-2025 suggest underlying demand remains robust

**Moderating Factors:**
1. **Late 2025 deceleration:** December 2025 was flat YoY
2. **Feb 16-22 specific weakness:** This exact week declined in 2025 vs 2024
3. **Short forecast window:** Only 1-7 days out, so major surprises unlikely
4. **Mid-month timing:** Not a holiday period; less volatile than peak travel weeks

**Synthesis:**
Given the strong +13% to +21% YoY growth in early February 2026, a reasonable expectation is that Feb 16-22, 2026 will show substantial growth over the 16.66M from 2025. However, the specific calendar positioning and the fact that this week underperformed in 2025 suggests some caution. A growth rate in the +8% to +18% range seems plausible, yielding approximately 18.0M to 19.7M passengers.

Outside view calibration:

**Distribution Anchoring:**
- Historical baseline (2025): 16.66M
- Strong growth scenario (+18%): 19.66M
- Moderate growth scenario (+10%): 18.33M
- Weak growth scenario (+5%): 17.49M

**Tail Considerations:**

**Lower tail (10th percentile):**
- Unlikely to fall below 2025 given strong early 2026 momentum
- Minimal growth scenario: +3% to +5%
- 10th percentile: ~17.2M

**Upper tail (90th percentile):**
- Early Feb 2026 showed up to +21% growth
- Could potentially exceed if momentum accelerates
- 90th percentile: ~19.8M

**Central tendency:**
- Median expectation around +12% to +14%
- 50th percentile (median): ~18.7M

**Distribution shape:**
Given the short timeframe (1-7 days) and available partial data, uncertainty is moderate but not extreme. The distribution should be somewhat tight around the central estimate, with wider tails to account for unexpected events (weather disruptions, operational issues, or stronger-than-expected demand).

**Calibration checks:**
- Range (10th to 90th): 17.2M to 19.8M represents reasonable uncertainty
- Median of 18.7M implies +12.2% growth over 2025
- Consistent with early Feb 2026 momentum while being slightly conservative
- Allows for both upside surprise and modest disappointment
