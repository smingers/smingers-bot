Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**TSA Checkpoint Travel Numbers (tsa.gov)** - Official government data source, highest quality. Contains daily passenger volumes through February 12, 2026. This is the resolution source for the question, making it authoritative.

**TSA Weekly Volumes Spreadsheet** - Compiled historical data showing 7-day rolling averages and YoY changes. Most recent data through February 8, 2026 shows YoY growth ranging from +13.53% to +21.14% in early February 2026. High quality, factual data.

**Agent Report on Historical Data** - Provides critical historical baseline:
- Feb 16-22, 2024: 16,738,824 passengers
- Feb 16-22, 2025: 16,664,702 passengers (-0.44% YoY)
- Missing 2023 data, but the two years available show near-flat growth

**U.S. Travel Association Dashboard (Feb 2, 2026)** - Industry research showing December 2025 air passenger volumes were flat YoY (0% change), with full year 2025 growth of only 0.3%. This indicates a significant deceleration from earlier pandemic recovery years. High quality source.

**ABC News article (July 2025)** - Reports record-breaking days in summer 2025, with expert Keith Jeffries noting "steady year-over-year growth of 3 to 5% on average." This is opinion from an identified expert but refers to broader trends, not February specifically.

**Other sources** (CBP data, Statista market share, blog post) - Not directly relevant to TSA passenger volume forecasting.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **Same calendar week in previous years** - Most suitable. Feb 16-22 falls in the third week of February, typically a low-travel period between Presidents' Day weekend and spring break.
2. **All February weeks 2024-2026** - Too broad; weekly patterns vary significantly.
3. **Post-pandemic recovery trajectory** - Less relevant now that recovery has plateaued.

**Chosen reference class:** Same calendar week (Feb 16-22) in 2024 and 2025, adjusted for 2026 trends.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** The target week begins tomorrow (Feb 16, 2026) and ends in 7 days (Feb 22, 2026).

**Historical patterns for this specific week:**
- Feb 16-22, 2024: 16,738,824 passengers
- Feb 16-22, 2025: 16,664,702 passengers (-0.44% YoY)

**Broader February 2026 context:**
- Early February 2026 (Feb 1-12) shows strong YoY growth: +13% to +21% compared to 2025
- However, U.S. Travel Association data shows December 2025 was flat YoY (0%)
- Full year 2025 growth was only 0.3%, indicating maturation/saturation

**Day-of-week pattern:** The week spans Monday-Sunday, including both weekday business travel and weekend leisure travel.

## (d) Justification

The target week Feb 16-22, 2026 presents a complex picture:

**Bearish factors:**
- The identical week in 2025 saw a slight decline (-0.44%) vs 2024
- Late 2025 showed travel demand plateauing (December flat YoY)
- Full year 2025 growth was minimal (0.3%)
- This suggests the post-pandemic recovery boom has ended

**Bullish factors:**
- Early February 2026 data shows robust YoY growth (+13% to +21%)
- This could indicate renewed momentum in 2026
- Economic conditions appear stable (per expert commentary)

**Most likely scenario:** The early February 2026 strength likely reflects specific factors (perhaps Presidents' Day weekend spillover or weather-related rescheduling from late January). The more sustainable baseline is the late 2025 plateau. I expect Feb 16-22, 2026 to show modest growth over 2025, but nowhere near the +13-21% seen in early February 2026.

**Base estimate:** Given 2025 was 16,664,702 and considering:
- Late 2025 plateau (0% growth)
- Early Feb 2026 surge (+13-21%)
- Regression toward sustainable trend

I estimate 2-5% growth over 2025, yielding approximately 17.0-17.5 million passengers.

## Outside view calibration:

**Distribution considerations:**
- Historical volatility: The -0.44% change from 2024→2025 shows this week can vary
- Early Feb 2026 shows high variance (+13% to +21% across different days)
- Weather disruptions, airline operational issues, or economic shocks could cause significant deviations
- The 2024-2025 comparison suggests a range of roughly ±1-2% is normal

**Anchoring to established patterns:**
- 2024 baseline: 16,738,824
- 2025 baseline: 16,664,702
- Early Feb 2026 suggests upward momentum

**Tail considerations:**
- 10th percentile: Significant disruption (severe weather, operational crisis) → ~16.2M
- 90th percentile: Strong sustained growth continues → ~18.0M
- These bounds represent roughly -3% to +8% from 2025

**Rate of upsets:** Air travel is relatively predictable week-to-week, but weather and operational disruptions occur. I'll set moderately wide bounds.
