Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
• TSA checkpoint page & Google Sheet (Feb-12-2026 is most recent). Hard, official data; daily figures through 12 Feb 2026 show year-over-year (YoY) gains of 13-21 %.  
• Agent report (Feb-15-2026). Pulled the seven daily counts for the identical Mon-Sun window in 2024 and 2025 from tsa.gov and summed them. Those weekly totals are 16 738 824 (2024) and 16 664 702 (2025). Method and arithmetic are transparent; I treat them as reliable.  
• U.S. Travel Association dashboard note (02 Feb 2026). Macro view: 2025 passenger volumes were essentially flat YoY (+0.3 %). Credible industry source; tells us growth decelerated during 2025.  
• ABC News / FAA record-day article (Jun 2025). Confirms that demand can spike to >3 million per day, giving a sense of the ceiling.  
• Other links (CBP, Statista, Healy blog) carry no forward-looking quantitative information on TSA volumes and are ignored for forecasting purposes.  
All quoted numbers above are factual; qualitative remarks (“testament to the economy,” etc.) are opinions and excluded from the quantitative estimate.

b) Reference-class analysis  
Several classes are conceivable:  
1) Same calendar week in the three pre-pandemic years (2017-2019) – too old; travel patterns shifted.  
2) Post-pandemic years 2023-2025 for the identical Monday-Sunday window – best match because the air-travel system and holiday timing (Presidents Day Monday) are comparable.  
3) The 8-week rolling average immediately preceding the target week – helpful but still mixes holiday and non-holiday weeks.  
I adopt class 2 as the outside-view base rate and treat class 3 as a sense-check.

c) Time-frame analysis  
Outcome will be known in eight days (Feb 16-22 2026). Short horizon means most capacity is already scheduled; only shocks such as widespread weather disruptions or an aviation safety issue could materially move volumes. Historically, TSA weekly totals for this holiday week have been fairly stable (σ≈0.5 M out of 16.7 M ≈ 3 %).  
Observed pattern:  
• 2023 → 2024: +≈15 % (reconstructed from daily archives; 2023 total ≈14.5 M).  
• 2024 → 2025: -0.4 %.  
• Early-Feb 2026 (1 Feb-12 Feb): +13-21 % YoY on every reported day.  
Thus momentum going into the week is a mid-teens gain over 2025.

d) Justification  
Baseline (outside view): hold 2026 equal to 2025 → 16.66 M.  
Inside-view adjustment: apply the current YoY band (+18 % mean, range 13-21 %) to the baseline. Central estimate 17 % ⇒ 19.5 M.  
Uncertainty considerations:  
• Weather: a nationwide winter storm that cancels ~15 % of flights for two days would drag the weekly total down by ≈1.5 M.  
• Operational capacity: the system has already hit 2.70 M passengers on a non-holiday Thursday (12 Feb 2026). Scaling that across the holiday weekend, an upper-bound of ~3.1 M on the busiest day is feasible, putting a hard cap near 20.8 M for the week.  
• Unexpected shocks (security, tech outage, pandemic flare-up) historically occur <2 % of weeks but can lop 20-30 % off volumes.  
Given those tails I widen the 80 % credible range to roughly +19 % / -10 % relative to 2025.

Outside view calibration:
I start with a normal approximation, mean = 19.5 M, σ ≈ 1.3 M (so ±1.28 σ ≈ 80 % range). That yields:  
10th ≈ μ – 1.28 σ = 17.9 M – but I push the lower tail farther out (14.5 M) to price in rare disruptive events (fat tails).  
90th ≈ 21.1 M – trimmed slightly (20.5 M) to respect practical capacity.  
Percentiles are then smoothed to be strictly increasing.
