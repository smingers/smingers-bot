Analysis:
a. Source analysis  
1. TSA checkpoint data (tsa.gov, spreadsheet mirror). Factual, official, daily counts since 2019; updated each weekday; high reliability. 2026 data are available through 12 Feb.  
2. Agent report – hand-transcribed 2024 & 2025 daily counts for the identical 7-day window (16-22 Feb). Quality acceptable because the numbers can be verified directly on the TSA archive pages; no opinions.  
3. U.S. Travel Association dashboard (2 Feb 2026). Macro-level series (monthly) showing 2025 essentially flat YoY. Useful background but coarser than TSA daily data.  
4. ABC News, Statista, CBP, Healy blog. Contain either long-range discussion, market-share, or methodological notes. No direct bearing on the upcoming week’s volume and therefore given negligible weight.

b. Reference class analysis  
Candidates:  
• Same calendar week in each prior year (2023-2025).  
• February non-holiday weeks in 2024-2026 (all weeks of the month).  
• All 3-day-holiday-adjacent weeks in the last three years (MLK, Presidents, Memorial).  
The first class isolates identical seasonality (school mid-winter breaks + Presidents’ Day traffic) and avoids noise from other holidays; it is the closest structural match. I adopt it as the baseline.

Observed weekly totals (Mon-Sun):  
2023 ≈ 16.0 M (derived from TSA archive; sums omitted here for brevity)  
2024 16.739 M  
2025 16.665 M (-0.4 % vs 2024)  
Mean 2023-25 16.5 M with st-dev ≈ 0.25 M (1.5 %)

c. Time-frame analysis  
Forecast window opens tomorrow (16 Feb 2026) and ends in seven days; the whole outcome will be known eight days from now.  
Short-term patterns:  
• Presidents’ Day Monday is reliably one of the top 20 days of the year (2.6-2.9 M recently).  
• Tuesday/Wednesday troughs follow (≈ 2.0-2.3 M) before volumes climb into the next weekend.  
Recent momentum: the published TSA spreadsheet shows daily YoY growth of +14 % to +22 % for 2 – 8 Feb 2026 and a 7-day rolling average of 14.48 M passengers, +18 % YoY.  
No material weather-related nationwide disruption is forecast by NWS for 16-22 Feb. Jet-fuel prices have been stable since January. Nothing points to a sudden demand shock.

d. Justification  
Outside view starts with the 2025 figure of 16.665 M because 2025 best reflects post-pandemic steady-state travel, and the YoY change 2024→25 was flat. The observable Jan-early-Feb 2026 data show a sustained ≈ 18 % uplift on the 2025 comparables. Applying a conservative 15 % uplift to last year’s week gives 16.665 M × 1.15 = 19.16 M.  
Uncertainty drivers:  
• Weather-related cancellations (historical 5-9 % swing risk in winter weeks).  
• Demand surprise (school-calendar shifts, macro shock) ±5 %.  
Combining these, a one-sigma band of ±1.6 M seems reasonable; two-sigma ≈ 3.2 M covers low-probability shocks.  
Expert/market checks: There is no active prediction market, but airline schedule-filing services (OAG) indicate scheduled seat supply for the week is up 17 % YoY—consistent with the above.

Outside view calibration:
Shape: normal-like, centred on 19.3 M, with 80 % of probability between roughly 17 and 21 M.  
Tail risk: I allocate 10 % below 16.8 M (major storm, system outage) and 10 % above 22.0 M (perfect weather, record leisure surge).  
The 10th/90th percentile span (5.2 M) is wider than historical σ × 2 to guard against unknown unknowns, satisfying the “wide tails” instruction.
