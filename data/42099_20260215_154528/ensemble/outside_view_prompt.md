# Summary of Article: "TSA Screening Volume and Epiweeks"

**Article Type:** Technical blog post about data visualization and time series analysis

**Key Relevant Information:**

1. **Data Source Confirmation:** The TSA makes daily checkpoint counts available back to January 2019 on its website. The author notes that more data may be available elsewhere.

2. **Data Characteristics:** The article analyzes a six-year daily time-series of TSA traveler screening volumes, showing fine-grain details including:
   - Periodic fluctuations between workday vs weekend travel
   - Differences in travel rates across different days of the week
   - Major impact of COVID-19 pandemic on travel volumes

3. **Technical Methodology Discussion:** The article focuses heavily on the technical challenge of aggregating daily TSA data into weekly totals, specifically:
   - The problem of partial weeks at year boundaries creating misleading data points
   - Two standards for defining weeks: ISO Week (starts Monday, used internationally) and CDC's Epidemiological Week or "epiweek" (starts Sunday, used in the United States)
   - The importance of using epiweek/epiyear functions to ensure all weeks have exactly seven days for accurate weekly aggregation

**Note:** This article does not contain forecasts, predictions, or statistics about future TSA passenger volumes. It is primarily a technical discussion about how to properly aggregate historical TSA daily screening data into weekly totals for visualization purposes.

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide TSA daily passenger volumes for February 16-22 in 2023, 2024, and 2025 and give weekly totals with YoY growth
Objective revisited  
The goal is to lay down a clean historical baseline of TSA-reported passenger-throughput for the identical seven-day window – Monday 16 Feb through Sunday 22 Feb – in each of the three reference years 2023, 2024 and 2025, then total each week and calculate year-over-year (YoY) growth rates.  This baseline is the main input needed by forecasters who will next estimate the figure for the same week in 2026.

What the current search results give us  

1. Full 2024 data.  
   • The TSA “2024 checkpoint travel numbers” archive page lists every calendar day and its count (source: tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes/2024).  
   • Relevant rows:

      16 Feb 2024  2,615,463  
      17 Feb 2024  2,159,328  
      18 Feb 2024  2,474,646  
      19 Feb 2024  2,606,125  
      20 Feb 2024  2,206,877  
      21 Feb 2024  2,162,956  
      22 Feb 2024  2,513,429  

   • 7-day total 2024 = 16,738,824 passengers (own sum of the seven figures).  

2. Full 2025 data (re-stated from the previous research step; the page exists at tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes/2025 even though that link did not surface in the new snippets).  

      16 Feb 2025  2,394,991  
      17 Feb 2025  2,721,332  
      18 Feb 2025  2,243,788  
      19 Feb 2025  2,122,519  
      20 Feb 2025  2,466,484  
      21 Feb 2025  2,553,110  
      22 Feb 2025  2,162,478  

   • 7-day total 2025 = 16,664,702 passengers.  

3. YoY change that can be computed so far.  
   • 2025 vs 2024:  
     (16,664,702 ÷ 16,738,824 – 1) × 100 = -0.44 %  
   • Interpretation: throughput during Feb 16-22 slipped fractionally (about four-tenths of one percent) from 2024 to 2025.

Information still missing  

• The 2023 archive page – and therefore the seven daily counts for 16 Feb 2023 through 22 Feb 2023 – did not appear in the returned results.  
• Without those figures we cannot calculate:  
  – the 2023 weekly total, nor  
  – the YoY growth from 2023→2024.

Why the gap matters  
Historical momentum is one of the most powerful variables in short-term volume forecasting.  Having two sequential YoY deltas (2024 vs 2023; 2025 vs 2024) allows a forecaster to judge whether growth is accelerating, decelerating or plateauing as 2026 approaches.  At present we can assess only the second of those two deltas.

Next factual item required  
Pull the TSA 2023 checkpoint archive – normally found at  
https://www.tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes/2023 – and record the counts for:

• Thu 16 Feb 2023  
• Fri 17 Feb 2023  
• Sat 18 Feb 2023  
• Sun 19 Feb 2023  
• Mon 20 Feb 2023  
• Tue 21 Feb 2023  
• Wed 22 Feb 2023  

Once captured, sum to a weekly figure and compute:

• YoY % = (2024 total ÷ 2023 total – 1) × 100.

If, for any reason, tsa.gov no longer hosts the 2023 page, the identical data series is mirrored in the DHS “COVID-19 Passenger Throughput” dataset on Data.gov, whose metadata entry is dated 25 Feb 2024 (catalog.data.gov… / TSA-1ebecc72…).

Conclusion – what we have vs. what is still needed  

Completed:  
• Daily counts and weekly totals for Feb 16-22 2024 and Feb 16-22 2025.  
• YoY growth (-0.44 %) from 2024 to 2025.

Outstanding:  
• Daily counts and weekly total for the same window in 2023.  
• YoY growth from 2023 to 2024.

Once the 2023 archive numbers are retrieved, the requested historical table will be fully populated and ready for use in producing a 2026 forecast.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
