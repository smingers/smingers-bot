Analysis:
To forecast TSA passenger volume for Feb 16–22 2026 I need:  
• Latest daily TSA throughput up to Feb 14 2026 to establish the baseline trend.  
• Year-ago (Feb 17–23 2025) and 2024 figures for comparison.  
• News about projected demand for the 2026 Presidents Day holiday (Feb 14–17) since that long weekend kicks off the target week.  
• Statements from TSA, airlines, trade groups (Airlines for America, AAA) or analysts mentioning expected record numbers, staffing, or flight schedules for mid-February 2026.  
These elements will help decide whether growth continues at double-digit rates and how high volumes might spike.
