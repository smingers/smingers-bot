Analysis:
To build a quantitative outside-view forecast I want three pieces of historical context:  
1. TSA daily checkpoint numbers for the exact Monday–Sunday window that contains Presidents’ Day in the last several years (2023-2025).  This shows the normal seasonality for that holiday week.  
2. The average year-over-year growth rate that has prevailed since the post-Covid recovery (roughly +8-12 % in 2023-2025).  This lets me project 2026 from the 2025 baseline.  
3. Any recent news suggesting the growth trend has accelerated or slowed (e.g. capacity constraints, new airline schedules, macro headwinds).  

Therefore my searches focus on:
• Pulling TSA’s official daily numbers around 16-22 Feb for past years.  
• Locating news coverage of record TSA volume or generalized traffic growth in early 2026.  
• Using an Agent query to automatically extract and sum the historical week totals so I can fit a simple growth model.  

Search queries:  
1. TSA checkpoint numbers February 2025 (Google)  
2. TSA travel volumes February 2024 (Google News)  
3. Provide TSA daily passenger volumes for February 16-22 in 2023, 2024, and 2025 and give weekly totals with YoY growth (Agent)
