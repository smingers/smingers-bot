This situation mirrors the 43-day shutdown in 2024, which caused widespread flight cancellations, long security lines, and airport disruptions, including the temporary closure of two security checkpoints at Philadelphia International Airport. Experts, including John Rose, Chief Risk Officer at Altour, and Rich Davis, senior security advisor at International SOS, warn that the current shutdown may lead to similar or worse disruptions, including longer wait times, delayed luggage processing, and flight delays due to airlines postponing departures to ensure passengers clear security. Travelers are advised to plan ahead, allow extra time, avoid prohibited items in carry-ons, and not rely solely on real-time wait time updates. The U.S. Travel Association, Airlines for America, and the American Hotel & Lodging Association have jointly warned that the shutdown poses a serious threat to air travel during the peak spring break season. The deadlock stems from Democratic lawmakers refusing to approve DHS funding without new immigration restrictions, halting negotiations. As of the article\u2019s publication, no resolution had been reached, and lawmakers warned they might return early if a deal is made. TSA officers are under increased pressure, working without compensation, reduced staffing, and facing frustrated travelers, highlighting the fragility of federal funding and its direct impact on national security and travel infrastructure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 09:05 PM\nSource:[Travel And Tour World](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/tsa-workers-continue-without-pay-during-u-s-government-shutdown-prompting-concerns-over-security-lines-and-flight-delays/)\n\n**Not Again: 50,000 TSA Officers Face Unpaid Work As Shutdown Threatens Spring Break Travel**\nA partial government shutdown of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) began on Friday, February 13, 2026, after funding expired at midnight, affecting approximately 50,000 Transportation Security Administration (TSA) officers who are deemed essential personnel but will work without pay. Unlike the 43-day shutdown in 2024, which impacted air traffic controllers and led to widespread flight cancellations, air traffic controllers will continue receiving pay because the rest of the federal government is funded through September 30, 2026. However, TSA workers\u201495% of whom are essential\u2014must continue working without compensation, raising concerns about unscheduled absences, increased call-outs, and longer security lines. The U.S. Travel Association, Airlines for America, and the American Hotel & Lodging Association jointly warned that unpaid work risks disrupting travel, citing potential delays and missed flights. Negotiations between the White House and Democratic lawmakers have stalled, with Democrats refusing to approve DHS funding unless new restrictions on federal immigration operations are included. Democrats have presented ten demands, including body cameras (bipartisan) and a ban on masks to conceal identity (controversial), while Republicans\u2019 attempt to pass a short-term funding extension was blocked by Democrats, who labeled it 'insufficient and complete.' Passengers are advised to arrive at airports 1\u20132 hours early, prepare carry-ons by removing liquids/gels into clear bags, keeping laptops accessible, removing shoes, and emptying pockets. Enrolled travelers in TSA PreCheck, Global Entry, or CLEAR may bypass certain screening steps, but others must follow all security instructions and review prohibited items to avoid delays.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 08:05 PM\nSource:[Simple Flying](https://simpleflying.com/not-again-tsa-officers-unpaid-shutdown-spring-break/)\n\n**Partial government shutdown forces TSA agents to work without pay at airports**\nA partial government shutdown of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) began at dawn on Saturday, February 14, 2026, directly impacting the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which is responsible for screening passengers and baggage at airports nationwide. According to The Associated Press (AP), TSA agents are required to continue working without pay during ongoing congressional negotiations to fund DHS. This situation echoes the 43-day government shutdown that caused mass cancellations and long airport lines. While the current scenario may differ, experts warn that impacts could emerge more quickly this time, as workers still remember the recent crisis. Unlike previous shutdowns, most of the federal government remains funded through September 30, 2026, so air traffic controllers will continue receiving salaries, reducing the risk of widespread flight cancellations. However, approximately 95% of TSA personnel are deemed essential and must work without pay. Democratic lawmakers have tied DHS funding to new restrictions on federal immigration policy, complicating a swift resolution. In past shutdowns, airport disruptions were not immediate but developed over time. Experts now believe delays may appear faster due to heightened worker fatigue and memory of recent strain. Even minor absences of TSA agents could cause long lines, especially at smaller airports. Airlines may delay departures to wait for passengers still undergoing security checks. Tourism and airline associations warn that a prolonged shutdown could increase the risk of delays, missed flights, and longer wait times, particularly during the spring travel season. Experts recommend arriving at the airport earlier than usual, checking real-time wait times online, and packing appropriately to avoid additional screenings.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 04:42 PM\nSource:[Univision](https://www.univision.com/noticias/estados-unidos/cierre-parcial-gobierno-obliga-a-agentes-de-la-tsa-a-laborar-sin-sueldo-en-aeropuertos)\n\n**US Travel Disruption Alert: TSA Screeners Hold Security Lines Amid Shutdown With No Pay - Travel And Tour World**\nA partial United States government shutdown began on February 14, 2026, after Congress failed to pass an appropriations bill, causing the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) funding to lapse. As a result, essential personnel, including 95% of Transportation Security Administration (TSA) agents, are required to continue working at major U.S. airports without pay until funding is restored. Federal law mandates retroactive pay once appropriations are approved. This situation threatens airport security operations, with major airlines and travel associations warning that unpaid work could lead to increased absenteeism, longer security wait times, and potential delays\u2014especially during peak travel periods like spring break. Although air traffic controllers remain paid and operational, the stress on TSA staffing could still cause localized delays and congestion. Historical precedent from the 2018\u201319 shutdown shows that many TSA agents called out sick during unpaid periods, contributing to long lines. Analysts recommend travelers arrive two to three hours before domestic flights and even earlier for international departures, monitor real-time wait times via apps, and consider flexible tickets or travel insurance. The shutdown affects only DHS functions, with most other federal agencies remaining funded through September 2026. The ongoing situation poses a significant risk to travel efficiency and passenger experience during a high-demand travel season.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 04:00 PM\nSource:[Travel And Tour World](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/us-travel-disruption-alert-tsa-screeners-hold-security-lines-amid-shutdown-with-no-pay/)\n\n**TSA agents are working without pay at U.S. airports due to another partial government shutdown**\nA partial government shutdown of the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), effective early Saturday, 2026, has impacted the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), which is responsible for screening passengers and baggage at airports nationwide. TSA agents are working without pay amid a lack of agreement on DHS' annual funding, similar to the 43-day shutdown in 2024 that caused historic flight cancellations and long delays. Although TSA officers previously worked through the record shutdown that ended on November 12, 2024, aviation experts suggest this current shutdown may unfold differently. Trade groups representing the U.S. travel industry and major airlines warn that prolonged lapses in DHS appropriations could lead to extended security lines at commercial airports.

With approximately 95% of TSA workers classified as essential and continuing duties despite no compensation, airlines including American Airlines, United, Delta, and Southwest are preparing for significant disruptions. Security lines are expected to lengthen, flight delays and cancellations are likely, and the impact is particularly acute for international travelers from Canada, Mexico, the UK, and Germany\u2014key tourism markets. Major U.S. airports such as JFK, LAX, MIA, and ORD are anticipating heightened congestion, with travelers advised to arrive at least three hours before departure. The hospitality industry is also feeling strain, with hotels and resorts expecting reduced bookings due to travel uncertainty. Airlines are implementing contingency plans, including real-time updates and flexible rebooking, but the situation remains volatile.

With TSA employees being required to work without pay, flight delays and longer security screening times have increased, raising concerns about operational efficiency and passenger safety. Travel groups and airlines have issued joint warnings about the risks of unscheduled absences among TSA agents, which could severely impact air travel. The shutdown affects multiple DHS agencies, including the TSA and the U.S. Coast Guard, though the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) remains funded for the year, helping to mitigate some air traffic control issues. The Coast Guard could suspend non-essential missions if funding remains unavailable, affecting around 56,000 workers. While ICE continues operating under the 'One Big Beautiful Bill Act,' which allocated $75 billion for its operations, the broader funding deadlock has stalled immigration-related reforms. Lawmakers have blocked recent funding bills over demands for stricter immigration enforcement, including bans on face masks for agents and enhanced warrant procedures. The shutdown is expected to persist until at least the State of the Union address on February 24, 2026, with Congress possibly reconvening earlier if negotiations progress. The DHS holds $165 billion in available funds, but uncertainty over budget negotiations continues to threaten travel efficiency, security, and public confidence in the U.S. transportation system.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 07:19 AM\nSource:[Travel And Tour World](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/u-s-airports-in-crisis-as-government-shutdown-forces-tsa-employees-to-work-without-pay-leading-to-widespread-flight-delays-and-security-challenges/)\n\n**TSA agents are working without pay at US airports due to another shutdown - The Boston Globe**\nThe U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) appropriations lapsed at midnight on February 14, 2026, resulting in TSA agents working without pay, as approximately 95% are deemed essential personnel under the department's contingency plan. While air traffic controllers remain funded and will continue receiving paychecks, the lack of DHS funding\u2014due to a legislative impasse between Democrats and the White House\u2014threatens to disrupt air travel. Democrats are withholding support for DHS funding until new restrictions are placed on federal immigration operations following the fatal shootings of Alex Pretti and Renee Good in Minneapolis. The American Hotel & Lodging Association, U.S. Travel, and Airlines for America warned that the shutdown could lead to longer security lines, flight delays, and reduced domestic flight schedules, particularly during the busy spring break travel season. Experts note that even a few unscheduled TSA absences could cause significant delays, especially at smaller airports with single checkpoints. Travelers are advised to arrive early, check airport wait times in advance (as they may be outdated by the time of departure), and avoid prohibited items such as full-size liquids, gels, aerosols, and pocketknives in carry-on bags. John Rose, chief risk officer at Altour, emphasized that TSA agents are working without pay, with reduced staffing and under stress, urging travelers to practice patience and empathy.

The total projected inter-regional population movement is 9.5 billion\u4eba\u6b21, setting a new historical record. Rail and civil aviation passenger volumes are expected to reach 540 million and 95 million respectively. National Railway Group reported that daily average passenger volume will reach 13.48 million, a 5.0% increase from the previous year. The railway system introduced 560 additional or optimized passenger trains, expanded 3,109 km of new lines, and deployed 251 new EMUs, with peak daily train operations exceeding 14,000, increasing seating capacity by 5.3%. Enhanced services include 'urgent passenger' lanes, clear signage, charging seats, and a new phone booking service for passengers aged 60 and above. A new policy allows free refunds for misbooked tickets within a time limit, to be made permanent. In civil aviation, China Eastern Airlines operated over 3,000 flights on the first day, with passenger volume surpassing 420,000. The C919 aircraft began commercial service on the Shanghai Hongqiao to Zhuhai route. China Eastern plans to operate 125,000 flights with 822 aircraft, increasing daily flights by 3.6% and C919 flights by 52.6%.

The busiest airports include Guangzhou Baiyun, Shanghai Pudong, Shenzhen Bao'an, Beijing Capital, and Chengdu Tianfu. The most in-demand routes are Shanghai Hongqiao\u2013Shenzhen Bao'an, Hangzhou Xiaoshan\u2013Shenzhen Bao'an, Shanghai Hongqiao\u2013Guangzhou Baiyun, Hangzhou Xiaoshan\u2013Guangzhou Baiyun, and Shenzhen Bao'an\u2013Beijing Capital. According to the Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) Operations Monitoring Center, the 2026 Spring Festival holiday will be the longest in history, lasting nine days, which is expected to significantly boost long-distance travel demand. As a result, air travel demand will be exceptionally high, with peak flight volumes lasting longer and reaching higher levels than in previous years. Daily flight volume is projected to reach approximately 20,000 during the week before the festival, and during the holiday period (excluding Chinese New Year's Eve and the first day of the Lunar New Year), daily flights may average 19,500, an increase of about 1,000 flights compared to the previous year. Domestically, hub airports such as Guangzhou Baiyun, Chengdu Tianfu, and Hangzhou Xiaoshan saw flight volume increases of about 15%, while flights between Beijing Capital, Guangzhou Baiyun, Shenzhen Bao'an, and Hangzhou Xiaoshan increased by over 25%. Internationally, China-Thailand and China-South Korea passenger flights averaged over 300 daily flights, leading all international routes. Flight volume increases were most significant on routes to Indonesia, Vietnam, Russia, and Malaysia. On the first day of the travel season, weather across China was generally favorable, with clear to partly cloudy conditions nationwide. However, frequent cold fronts are expected, with snow affecting northern Xinjiang, North China, Northeast China, northern Central China, and northern East China. Low visibility due to snowmelt fog is anticipated in northern Xinjiang from late February to March, particularly impacting Urumqi Airport. Additionally, convective weather is expected in parts of Yunnan-Guizhou, central-southern Central China, and central-southern East China from late February to March. The 2026 Spring Festival travel season runs from February 2 to March 13, with an estimated 95 million passengers transported, averaging 2.38 million passengers per day and 19,400 flights daily. To manage the increased demand, civil aviation authorities have prepared in advance with optimized flight scheduling, equipment maintenance, personnel and supply reserves. The civil aviation meteorological department will enhance weather monitoring and issue timely forecasts and warnings for adverse weather, enabling scientific flight adjustments. Airlines and airports will use multiple channels to disseminate flight information, ensuring passengers receive timely and accurate updates.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51](https://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2026/0202/c1004-40658135.html)\n\n**2026 Civil Aviation Spring Festival Travel Season Passenger Volume Expected to Reach 95 Million**\nThe Civil Aviation Administration of China (CAAC) announced on January 19, 2026, that the 2026 Spring Festival travel season will run from February 2 to March 13, lasting 40 days. The CAAC forecasts that the total passenger volume for the period will reach approximately 95 million trips, averaging 2.38 million passengers per day\u2014setting a new historical record. According to Wang Weijun, Deputy Director of the CAAC's Transport Department, rising interest in flight bookings is driven by the integration of aviation, tourism, and culture, extended holidays, and relaxed entry/exit policies. Popular routes include northern winter snow tourism and southern warm-weather getaways, with both outbound and inbound travel expected to see new peaks. Due to the late timing of the Lunar New Year, post-holiday return travel for students and working professionals is expected to be highly concentrated, with a projected single-day peak of 2.6 million passengers. To meet demand, the CAAC has coordinated with industry stakeholders to optimize flight scheduling, increasing capacity to major hub airports and tourist destinations domestically, and enhancing international routes\u2014especially to neighboring countries and key inbound tourism markets. Airlines are encouraged to develop 'direct connection through trunk and feeder routes' and air-rail intermodal services to expand travel options. Passenger service improvements include enhanced inter-departmental and inter-regional coordination, refined traffic management, and a commitment to maintaining a high flight normalcy rate. Airlines are also required to implement 'integrated service and operations' standards, ensuring timely updates on flight delays and efficient ticket refund and rescheduling processes. Special attention is being given to the needs of elderly, child, disabled, and first-time travelers, with service procedures being optimized and details refined to improve accessibility and comfort.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 01:20 AM\nSource:[china.org.cn/china.com.cn(\u4e2d\u56fd\u7f51)](http://travel.china.com.cn/txt/2026-01/20/content_118289242.shtml)\n\n**China's Civil Aviation Spring Festival Travel Season Passenger Volume Expected to Reach Record High in 2026**\nAccording to a press conference held by the Civil Aviation Administration of China on January 19, 2026, the civil aviation passenger transport volume during this year's Spring Festival travel season is expected to reach 95 million passengers, averaging 2.38 million passengers per day, representing a 5.3% year-on-year increase. The 2026 Spring Festival travel season runs from February 2 to March 13, lasting 40 days. The Deputy Director of the Transport Department, Wang Weijun, highlighted four key characteristics of this year's\u6625\u8fd0: first, passenger volume is expected to set a new record; second, two peak travel periods are anticipated, particularly after the late Chinese New Year, with a single-day peak potentially reaching 2.6 million passengers; third, tourism demand is rising, driven by integrated aviation-tourism initiatives, extended holidays, and eased outbound/inbound travel policies, with increased interest in northern winter sports and southern warm-weather destinations, and a surge expected in both outbound and inbound flights; fourth, complex weather conditions such as rain, snow, and ice may pose significant operational challenges, requiring enhanced coordination among airlines, airports, and air traffic control. The Civil Aviation Administration has proactively assessed market conditions, conducted route and schedule reviews, and allocated temporary flight slots. Domestic flights will focus on increasing capacity to major hubs and tourist destinations, while international flights will prioritize key regional routes and inbound tourism markets. The administration also encourages airlines to develop 'direct-to-connection' domestic through-flights and air-rail integration services to diversify travel options. Based on preliminary flight plans, a total of 780,000 flights are expected during the season, averaging 19,400 flights per day\u2014a 5% increase from last year\u2014ensuring strong support for passenger travel needs.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[\u4eba\u6c11\u7f51](https://finance.people.com.cn/n1/2026/0120/c1004-40648875.html)\n\n**Airport Traffic Hits US Record Sunday After Thanksgiving: Will Airline Stocks Take Flight Into 2026? - U.S. Global Jets ETF (ARCA:JETS)**\nOn November 30, 2025, the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) recorded a new U.S. airport screening record, with 3,133,924 passengers screened\u2014surpassing the previous high of 3,096,797 set on June 22, 2025. This marked the highest number of passengers ever screened in a single day in TSA history. All 10 of the busiest travel days in U.S. history have occurred in 2024 or 2025, with the top 10 listed by date and passenger count. The surge in travel followed the Thanksgiving holiday, during which over 18 million passengers were screened between November 25 and December 1, 2025. The record-breaking traffic comes less than a month after the 43-day federal government shutdown, which disrupted air travel due to unpaid air traffic controllers and other personnel. Despite potential quarterly earnings weakness from airlines like American Airlines (AAL), Delta (DAL), United (UAL), and Southwest (LUV) due to the shutdown, the high passenger volume could help offset losses. The U.S. Global Jets ETF (JETS), which holds these four airlines as its largest constituents, rose 1.71% to $26.65 on December 2, 2025, approaching its 52-week high from January 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 11:57 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/trading-ideas/long-ideas/25/12/49175595/airport-traffic-hits-us-record-sunday-after-thanksgiving-will-airline-stocks-take-flight-into-2026)\n\n**U.S. Air Travel Hits Record Daily Screening Levels on Thanksgiving Weekend Amid Storms and System Upgrades**\nOn November 30, 2025 (Sunday), the U.S. Transportation Security Administration (TSA) reported a record-breaking 3.13 million passengers screened at airports nationwide, surpassing the previous high of 3.09 million on June 22, 2025. This milestone occurred during the peak of the Thanksgiving travel season, despite severe winter storms and low visibility affecting the Midwest, which led to dangerous travel conditions and 7,563 flight delays or cancellations. The record-breaking passenger volume marks the 8th time in 2025 that daily screenings exceeded 3 million, compared to only two such instances before 2024. TSA's 2024 annual screening total reached 904 million passengers, a 5% increase from 2023, and the agency has expanded its workforce to nearly 60,000 employees to meet demand. The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) projected over 360,000 flights during the period from November 24 to December 2, the highest in 15 years. However, disruptions occurred due to a solar flare vulnerability discovered in Airbus A320 series aircraft software, prompting emergency upgrades across U.S. carriers; JetBlue canceled approximately 20 flights on Monday due to ongoing retrofitting. Severe winter storms in the Midwest and Great Lakes region brought snowfall up to 14 inches in Iowa and over 8 inches in parts of Illinois and Missouri. In response to the travel surge, U.S. Department of Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy launched a 'Civil Aviation Travel' campaign, appearing in a promotional video with a United Airlines flight attendant urging travelers to adopt stress-reducing behaviors. Duffy emphasized the importance of reducing anxiety in shared airspace and advocated for 'appropriate attire' and a return to the 'Golden Age of travel' characterized by elegance and mutual respect. TSA has urged travelers to arrive early and check flight statuses via airline apps or websites to avoid delays ahead of the upcoming Christmas and New Year holiday peak.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 01, 2025 10:32 PM\nSource:[The Epoch Times](https://www.epochtimes.com/b5/25/12/1/n14646917.htm)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
