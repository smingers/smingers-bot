The author notes that more data may be available elsewhere.\n\n2. **Data Characteristics:** The article analyzes a six-year daily time-series of TSA traveler screening volumes, showing fine-grain details including:\n   - Periodic fluctuations between workday vs weekend travel\n   - Differences in travel rates across different days of the week\n   - Major impact of COVID-19 pandemic on travel volumes\n\n3. **Technical Methodology Discussion:** The article focuses heavily on the technical challenge of aggregating daily TSA data into weekly totals, specifically:\n   - The problem of partial weeks at year boundaries creating misleading data points\n   - Two standards for defining weeks: ISO Week (starts Monday, used internationally) and CDC's Epidemiological Week or \"epiweek\" (starts Sunday, used in the United States)\n   - The importance of using epiweek/epiyear functions to ensure all weeks have exactly seven days for accurate weekly aggregation\n\n**Note:** This article does not contain forecasts, predictions, or statistics about future TSA passenger volumes. It is primarily a technical discussion about how to properly aggregate historical TSA daily screening data into weekly totals for visualization purposes.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cbp.gov/newsroom/national-media-release/cbp-releases-february-2025-monthly-update\">\n# Summary of CBP February 2025 Monthly Update\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Border Enforcement:**\n- U.S. Border Patrol nationwide apprehensions averaged approximately 330 per day in February 2025, described as \"the lowest nationwide average apprehensions in CBP history\"\n- Southwest border apprehensions: less than 300 per day\n- February 2025 southwest border apprehensions: 8,347 illegal aliens (71% decrease from January 2025's 29,101; 94% decrease from February 2024's 140,641)\n- Office of Field Operations encountered 3,362 inadmissible aliens at southwest border ports of entry in February 2025 (90% decrease from January 2025's 32,346; 93% decrease from February 2024's 49,272)\n\n**Drug Seizures:**\n- Between mid-January and end of February 2025, CBP seized over 10,900 pounds of drugs in operations in California, Arizona, and Pacific Northwest:\n  -

This baseline is the main input needed by forecasters who will next estimate the figure for the same week in 2026.\n\nWhat the current search results give us  \n\n1. Full 2024 data.  \n   \u2022 The TSA \u201c2024 checkpoint travel numbers\u201d archive page lists every calendar day and its count (source: tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes/2024).  \n   \u2022 Relevant rows:\n\n      16 Feb 2024  2,615,463  \n      17 Feb 2024  2,159,328  \n      18 Feb 2024  2,474,646  \n      19 Feb 2024  2,606,125  \n      20 Feb 2024  2,206,877  \n      21 Feb 2024  2,162,956  \n      22 Feb 2024  2,513,429  \n\n   \u2022 7-day total 2024 = 16,738,824 passengers (own sum of the seven figures).  \n\n2. Full 2025 data (re-stated from the previous research step; the page exists at tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes/2025 even though that link did not surface in the new snippets).  \n\n      16 Feb 2025  2,394,991  \n      17 Feb 2025  2,721,332  \n      18 Feb 2025  2,243,788  \n      19 Feb 2025  2,122,519  \n      20 Feb 2025  2,466,484  \n      21 Feb 2025  2,553,110  \n      22 Feb 2025  2,162,478  \n\n   \u2022 7-day total 2025 = 16,664,702 passengers.  \n\n3. YoY change that can be computed so far.  \n   \u2022 2025 vs 2024:  \n     (16,664,702 \u00f7 16,738,824 \u2013 1) \u00d7 100 = -0.44 %  \n   \u2022 Interpretation: throughput during Feb 16-22 slipped fractionally (about four-tenths of one percent) from 2024 to 2025.\n\nInformation still missing  \n\n\u2022 The 2023 archive page \u2013 and therefore the seven daily counts for 16 Feb 2023 through 22 Feb 2023 \u2013 did not appear in the returned results.  \n\u2022 Without those figures we cannot calculate:  \n  \u2013 the 2023 weekly total, nor  \n  \u2013 the YoY growth from 2023\u21922024.\n\nWhy the gap matters  \nHistorical momentum is one of the most powerful variables in short-term volume forecasting.  Having two sequential YoY deltas (2024 vs 2023; 2025 vs 2024) allows a forecaster to judge whether growth is accelerating, decelerating or plateauing as 2026 approaches.  At present we can assess only the second of those two deltas.\n\nNext factual item required  \nPull the TSA 2023 checkpoint archive \u2013 normally found at  \nhttps://www.tsa.gov/travel/passenger-volumes/2023 \u2013 and record the counts for:\n\n\u2022 Thu 16 Feb 2023  \n\u2022 Fri 17 Feb 2023  \n\u2022 Sat 18 Feb 2023  \n\u2022 Sun 19 Feb 2023  \n\u2022 Mon 20 Feb 2023  \n\u2022 Tue 21 Feb 2023  \n\u2022 Wed 22 Feb 2023  \n\nOnce captured, sum to a weekly figure and compute:\n\n\u2022 YoY % = (2024 total \u00f7 2023 total \u2013 1) \u00d7 100.\n\nIf, for any reason, tsa.gov no longer hosts the 2023 page, the identical data series is mirrored in the DHS \u201cCOVID-19 Passenger Throughput\u201d dataset on Data.gov, whose metadata entry is dated 25 Feb 2024 (catalog.data.gov\u2026 / TSA-1ebecc72\u2026).\n\nConclusion \u2013 what we have vs. what is still needed  \n\nCompleted:  \n\u2022 Daily counts and weekly totals for Feb 16-22 2024 and Feb 16-22 2025.  \n\u2022 YoY growth (-0.44 %) from 2024 to 2025.\n\nOutstanding:  \n\u2022 Daily counts and weekly total for the same window in 2023.  \n\u2022 YoY growth from 2023 to 2024.\n\nOnce the 2023 archive numbers are retrieved, the requested historical table will be fully populated and ready for use in producing a 2026 forecast.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData query=\"AIRRPMRNS\">\nNo matching FRED series found for \"AIRRPMRNS\".\n</FREDData>\n"
