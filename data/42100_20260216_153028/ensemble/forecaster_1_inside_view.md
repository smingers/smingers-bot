## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Historical volatility pattern**: Multiple independent sources (OpenRouter report, Agent data) confirm 13.3 percentage point swing from July (28%) to November (14.7%) 2025. This establishes high week-to-week and month-to-month volatility as structural feature.

2. **Competitive release cycle acceleration**: CNBC (Feb 4), SCMP (Feb 9), AskNews (Feb 15-16) all independently report major Chinese model releases in January-February 2026 (Qwen-3.5, GLM-5, DeepSeek V4, Kimi K 2.5, MiniMax M2.5). This suggests potential upward pressure on share.

3. **Cost advantage persistence**: CNBC reports DeepSeek at $0.30/1M tokens vs. Claude at $10/1M tokens. This 33x cost differential is structural and difficult to change quickly.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Recent rankings data**: CNBC reports DeepSeek 3rd, Kimi K 2.5 4th on OpenRouter in late January 2026. This suggests Chinese models maintaining top-tier positions but doesn't provide aggregate share data.

2. **Expert assessment of competitive dynamics**: Justin Lin (Alibaba) and Tang Jie (Zhipu) both express concern about widening performance gap with US models. This suggests potential headwinds but comes from potentially biased sources (Chinese company executives).

3. **Market fragmentation trend**: OpenRouter report notes "no single model surpassing 25% share" by late 2025. This suggests structural ceiling on any single origin's dominance.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **"AI Spring Festival" narrative**: Multiple AskNews articles emphasize competitive intensity, but this is largely qualitative and doesn't provide quantitative share projections.

2. **TrendForce ~15% figure for November 2025**: Conflicts with Agent report's 14.7% for Nov 11, but close enough to be consistent. However, methodology unclear.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 62 days from February 16, 2026 to week of April 19, 2026.

**If halved (31 days to mid-March 2026)**:
- Would expect less deviation from current state
- Recent model releases (Qwen-3.5, GLM-5, etc.) would have just launched, potentially driving temporary spike
- Would narrow distribution toward 18-26% range
- Less time for competitive responses or market equilibration

**If doubled (124 days to late June 2026)**:
- Would expect greater uncertainty and potential for larger swings
- More time for US model responses (GPT-5 improvements, new releases)
- More time for Chinese model quality/adoption to compound or plateau
- Would widen distribution toward 12-35% range
- Historical pattern shows 5-month periods can see 10-15 percentage point swings

**Current 62-day timeframe**: Moderate uncertainty. Enough time for new model releases to impact adoption but not enough for complete market restructuring. Recent Chinese model releases in January-February 2026 may drive near-term boost, but competitive responses could emerge.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Factors supporting upward shift from outside view (14.7% November baseline)**:

1. **Concentrated release wave (Strong)**: Unlike the gradual releases throughout 2025, January-February 2026 saw simultaneous major releases from Alibaba (Qwen-3.5), Zhipu (GLM-5), MiniMax (M2.5), and expected DeepSeek V4. This concentrated competitive push is unprecedented and could drive temporary spike similar to July 2025 peak (28%).

2. **Rankings momentum (Moderate)**: CNBC's late January data showing DeepSeek 3rd, Kimi K 2.5 4th suggests Chinese models maintaining strong positions entering 2026, potentially indicating rebound from November trough already underway.

3. **Cost pressure intensification (Moderate)**: With economic uncertainty and startup funding constraints, the 33x cost advantage becomes more salient. CNBC quotes multiple sources on cost-driven adoption.

**Factors supporting downward pressure or volatility**:

1. **Expert pessimism on quality gap (Moderate)**: Justin Lin and Tang Jie both express concern about widening performance gap. While potentially self-serving, these are informed insiders with access to competitive intelligence.

2. **Single-week measurement volatility (Strong)**: The question asks for one specific week, not monthly average. Historical data shows significant week-to-week variation. The July peak (28%) and November trough (14.7%) were both single-week measurements.

3. **Market fragmentation ceiling (Moderate)**: OpenRouter report notes no model >25% share. This suggests structural resistance to any origin dominating beyond ~30% ceiling.

**Net assessment**: The concentrated release wave in January-February 2026 is sufficiently novel to warrant upward shift from November baseline (14.7%), potentially toward the December "nearly 30%" reports. However, high volatility and single-week measurement add significant uncertainty. The April 19 week is ~10 weeks after the release wave, allowing time for adoption but also competitive response.

I'll shift the central tendency upward from outside view (19-23% at 40th-60th percentiles) to 21-25%, reflecting release momentum while maintaining wide tails for volatility.

## Distribution Calibration

**Baseline considerations**:
- November 11, 2025: 14.7% (most recent concrete data)
- December 2025 reports: "nearly 30%" (qualitative, possibly peak)
- Late January 2026: DeepSeek 3rd, Kimi K 2.5 4th (rankings suggest strength)
- January-February 2026: Major release wave (Qwen-3.5, GLM-5, M2.5, DeepSeek V4)

**Central tendency reasoning**:
The concentrated release wave suggests potential for rebound toward or above the December "nearly 30%" level. However, by April 19 (10 weeks post-release), initial excitement may have moderated. I expect central tendency around 22-24%, representing meaningful growth from November baseline but below July peak.

**Tail reasoning**:
- **10th percentile**: Significant competitive pressure from US models, security concerns, or quality issues could push back toward 13-15% range
- **90th percentile**: Sustained momentum from release wave, breakthrough adoption, or US model pricing issues could push toward 32-35% range, potentially exceeding July peak

**Volatility adjustment**:
Single-week measurement adds ~3 percentage points of noise in either direction. Historical 13.3 percentage point swing over 4 months suggests monthly volatility of ~3-4 percentage points. Over 2.5 months to April 19, swings of 8-10 percentage points from baseline are plausible.

**Distribution shape**:
Slightly right-skewed due to release momentum, but maintaining fat tails for high volatility environment.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Chinese model share (%) on OpenRouter for week of April 19, 2026, calculated by summing Chinese author token counts divided by total excluding "others"

2. **Outside view base rates**: 10th: 12%, 20th: 15%, 40th: 19%, 60th: 23%, 80th: 28%, 90th: 33%

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median ≈ 22%, mean ≈ 23%. This aligns with justification of rebound from November baseline (14.7%) driven by release wave, approaching but not exceeding July peak (28%).

4. **Key evidence pieces**:
   - Historical volatility: 28% → 14.7% over 4 months (Strong, factual)
   - Concentrated release wave Jan-Feb 2026: Qwen-3.5, GLM-5, M2.5, DeepSeek V4 (Strong, factual)
   - Late January rankings: DeepSeek 3rd, Kimi K 2.5 4th (Moderate, factual)
   - Cost advantage: 33x cheaper than Claude (Strong, factual)
   - Expert concern about quality gap widening (Moderate, opinion from identified experts)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Major US model breakthrough (e.g., GPT-5.5 with dramatic quality improvement and price cut) released in March 2026 could rapidly shift market share downward, potentially pushing outcome toward 12-15% range.

6. **Status quo consideration**: Current volatility is high, but 62-day timeframe is moderate. Recent release wave suggests deviation from November status quo (14.7%) is likely. However, maintaining some anchor toward 18-20% range as conservative baseline.

7. **Technicalities**: All percentiles strictly increasing, units in %, values within 15-45% bounds (though extending slightly beyond based on historical data showing peaks at 28%).
