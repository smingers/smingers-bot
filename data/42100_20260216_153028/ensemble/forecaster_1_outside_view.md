These appear sourced from PDF snapshots and the State of AI report charts. High confidence in these specific data points.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Technology adoption S-curves**: New technologies typically follow sigmoid adoption patterns with rapid growth phases followed by plateaus. Chinese AI models showed classic rapid adoption (1.2% → 28% in ~6 months mid-2025).

2. **Market share dynamics in competitive tech markets**: Markets with multiple viable alternatives tend toward fragmentation. The State of AI report notes "by late 2025, market fragmented with no single model surpassing 25% share."

3. **Open-source vs. proprietary software adoption**: Historical precedent shows open-source can capture significant share when offering comparable quality at lower cost (Linux, Android). Chinese models offer this value proposition.

4. **Weekly/seasonal volatility in API usage**: Platform usage can show significant week-to-week variation based on releases, pricing changes, outages, etc.

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: Market share dynamics in competitive tech markets with open-source alternatives, combined with weekly volatility patterns. This captures both the structural competitive dynamics and short-term fluctuations.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 62 days from Feb 16, 2026 to week of April 19, 2026 (resolution week).

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**

From available data points:
- Jan 5, 2025: ~5% Chinese share
- Jul 14, 2025: ~28% Chinese share (peak)
- Nov 11, 2025: 14.7% Chinese share
- Dec 2025 reports: "nearly 30%" mentioned again

**Key Observations:**

1. **Rapid growth phase (Jan-Jul 2025)**: 5% → 28% over ~6 months (23 percentage point increase)

2. **Volatility and pullback (Jul-Nov 2025)**: 28% → 14.7% over 4 months (13.3 percentage point decrease). This suggests the July peak may have been temporary, possibly driven by specific model releases or competitive dynamics.

3. **Potential stabilization (Nov-Dec 2025)**: Reports of "nearly 30%" in December suggest possible rebound from November's 14.7%, though exact weekly data unavailable.

4. **Trend drivers identified in sources**:
   - Cost advantages driving startup adoption
   - Rapid release cycles (Alibaba: every 20 days vs. Anthropic: 47 days)
   - Quality improvements narrowing gap with frontier models
   - Privacy/on-device processing advantages
   - Growing developer ecosystem and community support

5. **Countervailing factors**:
   - Market fragmentation (no model >25% by late 2025)
   - Potential regulatory/security concerns in enterprise adoption
   - Competition from US closed models (GPT-5, etc.)
   - Week-to-week volatility from new releases

**Projection to April 2026**: 
- From Nov 2025 to Apr 2026 is ~5 months
- Historical pattern shows high volatility (28% → 14.7% → ~30% over 5 months)
- The question asks for a specific week, which adds additional short-term noise

## (d) Justification for Outside View

The Chinese model share on OpenRouter has demonstrated:

1. **Strong structural growth**: From negligible (<2%) in early 2024 to double-digit percentages by mid-2025, driven by fundamental advantages (cost, efficiency, open-source flexibility).

2. **High volatility**: The 28% peak in July followed by 14.7% in November shows ~13 percentage point swings are possible over months. This could reflect:
   - Model release timing (new Chinese models vs. new US models)
   - Pricing changes
   - Quality perception shifts
   - Platform-specific dynamics

3. **Competitive equilibrium emerging**: Multiple sources note market fragmentation and no dominant player. Chinese models averaging 13-15% with peaks near 30% suggests a competitive but not dominant position.

4. **Momentum factors for continued growth**:
   - Aggressive release schedules continuing
   - Cost pressures on startups favoring open models
   - Quality gap narrowing per expert opinions
   - Growing ecosystem and developer adoption

5. **Limiting factors**:
   - Enterprise/regulated sector hesitancy
   - US model quality improvements (GPT-5, etc.)
   - Potential geopolitical/security concerns
   - Market fragmentation limiting any single origin's dominance

**Base Rate Estimate**: Given the November 2025 baseline of 14.7% and December reports of "nearly 30%", a reasonable central estimate for April 2026 would be in the 18-25% range, with significant uncertainty due to:
- 5-month projection window
- High historical volatility
- Single-week measurement (not monthly average)
- Competitive dynamics and release schedules unknown

The 15-45% bounds provided seem reasonable given historical range of 5-28% observed, with potential for continued growth or temporary peaks.

## Outside View Calibration

**Calibration Considerations:**

1. **Historical volatility**: The 13.3 percentage point swing from July to November 2025 over 4 months suggests monthly volatility of ~3-4 percentage points is plausible. Over 5 months to April 2026, swings of 10-15 percentage points from any baseline are possible.

2. **Baseline anchoring**: The most recent concrete data point is November 11, 2025 at 14.7%. December 2025 qualitative reports suggest "nearly 30%" but this may refer to peaks rather than sustained levels. I'll anchor around 18-22% as a central tendency with wide uncertainty.

3. **Tail risks**:
   - **Downside (10th percentile)**: Major US model release (GPT-5 improvement), security concerns, or Chinese model quality issues could push share back toward 10-12% range.
   - **Upside (90th percentile)**: Continued aggressive growth, major Chinese model breakthrough, or US model pricing increases could push toward 32-35% range.

4. **Single-week measurement**: The question asks for one specific week, not a monthly average. This adds ~2-3 percentage points of additional noise in either direction compared to a monthly average.

5. **Distribution shape**: Given structural growth trend but high volatility, I expect a somewhat right-skewed distribution (more upside potential than downside from central tendency) but with fat tails in both directions.

6. **Rate of upsets**: The AI model landscape has shown frequent surprises (DeepSeek R1 impact, rapid Chinese model improvements). I should maintain wide intervals to account for ~20-30% chance of outcomes outside the 10th-90th percentile range.

**Percentile Reasoning**:
- **10th percentile (~12%)**: Significant setback scenario - major competitive pressure from US models, or temporary dip like July→November 2025
- **20th percentile (~15%)**: Below-trend scenario - modest growth from November baseline or slight decline
- **40th percentile (~19%)**: Modest growth from November baseline, below December peak reports
- **60th percentile (~23%)**: Moderate growth continuing, approaching December "nearly 30%" reports
- **80th percentile (~28%)**: Strong growth scenario, matching July 2025 peak
- **90th percentile (~33%)**: Breakthrough scenario - exceeding previous peaks with sustained momentum
