Jenny Xiao (Leonis Capital): Chinese companies "burning cash," open-source is necessity. Mix of factual (IPO data) and expert opinion.

8. **AskNews articles (Jan-Feb 2026)**: Multiple sources reporting Chinese model launches (GLM-5, Qwen-3.5, DeepSeek V4 expected, M2.5). Consistent theme: focus on efficiency, cost reduction, rapid iteration. Factual product releases with some market speculation.

**Quality Assessment:**
- Strongest: OpenRouter direct data (Nov 2025 = 14.7%)
- Strong: OpenRouter/a16z report (2025 average 13%, peak 30%)
- Moderate: Recent news on model releases and market positioning
- Weak: Speculative predictions about future performance gaps

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Historical trajectory confirmed by multiple sources**: Chinese share grew from 1.2% (late 2024) to 13% average (2025), peaking at 30% mid-year, settling at 14.7-15% by Nov 2025. This is factual, from primary source (OpenRouter).
- **Structural advantage in open-source**: Multiple experts (Lian Jye Su/Omdia, Jenny Xiao/Leonis Capital) confirm Chinese companies have committed to open-source as core strategy due to economic necessity and government support. This creates sustained momentum.
- **Product release cycle**: Confirmed launches of Qwen-3.5 (Feb 2026), GLM-5 (Feb 2026), DeepSeek V4 expected (mid-Feb 2026), M2.5 (Feb 2026). Multiple independent sources. These releases typically drive usage spikes.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Cost advantage persisting**: CNBC reports DeepSeek/OpenAI gpt-oss at $0.30/M tokens vs. Claude at $10/M tokens. One entrepreneur saved $400k annually switching to Qwen. Logical causal link to adoption.
- **International adoption**: Moonshot AI's overseas revenue exceeded domestic (CNBC, Feb 2026); Qwen used by Perplexity, Nvidia, Stanford. Demonstrates non-China demand.
- **Current rankings**: DeepSeek 3rd, Kimi K 2.5 4th on OpenRouter (late Jan 2026 per CNBC). Shows sustained top-tier positioning.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Expert pessimism about frontier performance**: Justin Lin's <20% chance of overtaking US is opinion about long-term frontier capabilities, not near-term OpenRouter share.
- **"AI Spring Festival" hype**: Media narrative around model releases may overstate immediate impact.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 63 days (Feb 16 → Apr 19, 2026)

**Historical volatility**: Over 9-week periods in 2025, Chinese share showed:
- Jan-Mar 2025: 5% → 12% (+7pp)
- May-Jul 2025: 18% → 28% (+10pp)  
- Jul-Sep 2025: 28% → 18% (-10pp)
- Sep-Nov 2025: 18% → 15% (-3pp)

Standard 9-week swing: ±5-10 percentage points.

**If timeframe halved (4.5 weeks)**: Would narrow distribution significantly—expect ±3-5pp movement, center around 16-18%.

**If timeframe doubled (18 weeks)**: Would widen distribution—historical data shows 18-week swings can reach ±15pp, allowing range of 10-35%.

## (d) Justification for Inside View Adjustment

**Starting point**: Nov 2025 = 14.7%, 2025 average = 13%, recent trend slightly upward.

**Upward pressure (moderate-strong):**
1. **Multiple major releases in Feb 2026**: Qwen-3.5, GLM-5, DeepSeek V4, M2.5 all launching in immediate period before target week. Historical pattern shows new releases drive usage spikes (e.g., DeepSeek R1 in Jan 2025 drove share from 5% to 20%+ within weeks).
2. **Sustained cost advantage**: 30x price gap vs. Claude, 15x vs. Gemini Pro persists. No evidence of US price cuts.
3. **Open-source momentum**: Structural commitment means continuous iteration. Qwen-3 was "most popular open-model family" in 2025.

**Downward pressure (weak-moderate):**
1. **Frontier performance gap acknowledged**: Multiple Chinese AI leaders admit gap with US may be widening. However, OpenRouter users are cost-sensitive developers, not frontier researchers.
2. **Potential US policy pressure**: Mentioned but no concrete actions reported affecting OpenRouter access.
3. **GPT-6 speculation**: No confirmed release date; unlikely to impact by April 2026.

**Net assessment**: The confluence of multiple model releases in Feb 2026, combined with structural cost advantages and confirmed international adoption, creates moderate upward pressure from the Nov 2025 baseline of 14.7%. However, the share already peaked at 30% in July 2025 and settled back, suggesting natural ceiling around 25-30% (US models retain 70% share per multiple sources). 

**Distribution shift justification**: Moving from outside view centered at 18-20% to inside view centered at 20-22% is warranted by:
- Confirmed product releases in immediate pre-period
- Structural cost advantage (30x) unchanged
- Historical precedent of post-release spikes
- But constrained by demonstrated ceiling (~30%) and recent stability around 15%

This is not a radical departure from reference class—it's a modest upward shift reflecting near-term catalysts within historically observed ranges.

## Distribution Calibration

**Current state** (Feb 2026): ~15% (extrapolating from Nov 2025)

**Expected trajectory**: 
- Multiple model releases Feb-Mar 2026 likely drive 3-7pp increase by April
- Historical post-release pattern: 4-8 week lag for adoption
- Target week (Apr 19) is 9 weeks out—sufficient time for new models to gain traction

**Central tendency**: 20-23% (reflecting Feb releases + sustained cost advantage)

**Upside scenario** (P80-P90): Return toward July 2025 peak if:
- DeepSeek V4 proves breakthrough in capabilities
- Qwen-3.5 multimodal features drive enterprise adoption
- US models don't respond with price cuts
- Range: 26-33%

**Downside scenario** (P10-P20): Stagnation/decline if:
- New releases disappoint or have bugs
- OpenAI/Anthropic cut prices aggressively
- Regulatory pressure materializes
- Range: 15-18%

**Tail considerations**:
- P10 at 15%: Acknowledges possibility of no growth from current state
- P90 at 33%: Allows for return to peak but not beyond historical maximum
- Median ~21%: Modest increase from current ~15%, reflecting near-term catalysts

**Sensitivity check**: 
- Shifting P10 from 15→17 would imply overconfidence in upward momentum
- Shifting P90 from 33→30 would ignore historical peak precedent
- Current distribution balances known catalysts against demonstrated volatility

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Chinese model share on OpenRouter for week of April 19, 2026, measured as sum of Chinese author token counts divided by total (excluding "others"), in percentage units.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 10th: 14%, 20th: 16%, 40th: 18%, 60th: 21%, 80th: 26%, 90th: 32%. My inside view shifts this modestly upward (median 18%→21%) based on confirmed Feb 2026 model releases.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 21%; mean ≈ 22%. This aligns with: (a) Nov 2025 baseline of 15%, (b) multiple major releases in Feb creating 4-6pp lift, (c) historical precedent of post-release adoption within 8 weeks.

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - OpenRouter data shows 14.7% in Nov 2025 (factual, primary source)
   - Qwen-3.5, GLM-5, DeepSeek V4, M2.5 all launching Feb 2026 (confirmed, multiple sources)
   - Chinese models maintain 30x cost advantage vs. Claude (factual, CNBC)
   - Historical pattern: new releases drive 5-10pp spikes within 6-8 weeks (factual, OpenRouter/a16z)
   - 2025 peak was 30%, establishing upper bound (factual, primary source)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: OpenAI releases GPT-5.5 or GPT-6 in March 2026 with dramatically improved performance AND cuts prices by 50%, recapturing developer mindshare. This would push outcome DOWN to 12-16% range. Probability: <15%.

6. **Status quo**: Current ~15% is recent stable state (Nov 2025-Feb 2026). However, multiple confirmed product releases in immediate pre-period create higher-than-usual volatility. Slight upward bias from status quo is justified but not extreme.

7. **Technicalities**: Values strictly increasing, units in %, all within bounds [15, 45]. P10=15 (at lower bound), P90=33 (within bounds).
