Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**OpenRouter Rankings Page (openrouter.ai/rankings)** - Primary resolution source. Current/live data only, no historical values visible. High quality for current state but limited for trend analysis.

**OpenRouter State of AI 2025 Report** - Comprehensive study of 100 trillion tokens spanning ~2 years to 2025. Contains stacked-area charts showing weekly token share by author (Jan 2024-Oct 2025) with explicit Chinese authors (Qwen, DeepSeek, Baichuan, Moonshot, Yi). High quality empirical data but rasterized images make precise extraction difficult. Key readable datapoints:
- Week of Jan 5, 2025: ~5% total Chinese
- Week of Jul 14, 2025: ~28% peak (Qwen 14%, DeepSeek 8%, Moonshot 3%, Baichuan 2%, Yi 1%)
- Week of Oct 27, 2025: ~18% Chinese

**Al Jazeera article (Nov 13, 2025)** - Reports OpenRouter usage showing 7 Chinese models in top 20, with expert opinions from Nathan Lambert ("Chinese open models have become a de facto standard among startups in the US") and Rui Ma (noting cost-conscious early-stage companies drive adoption). Mix of factual usage data and expert opinion.

**NBC News article (Nov 30, 2025)** - Reports Kilo Code showing 7 of top 20 models are Chinese (6 open-source). Expert opinions from Misha Laskin, Lin Qiao ("The gap is really shrinking"), and Nathan Lambert ("The balance of power has been shifting rapidly in the last 12 months"). Alibaba released models every 20 days vs Anthropic's 47-day average in 2025.

**Arynews.tv article (Dec 10, 2025)** - Reports Chinese models reached "nearly 30%" of global usage, starting from 1.2% in late 2024. States 2025 YTD average was 13% weekly token volume, accelerating in H2 2025 to approach 13.7%. Based on OpenRouter/a16z study.

**SCMP article (Dec 8, 2025)** - Similar to Arynews, reporting trajectory from 1.2% (late 2024) to nearly 30% "over a few months" in 2025, with 13% YTD average.

**Scribd PDF (Nov 11, 2025)** - Snapshot of OpenRouter rankings showing: Qwen 8.1%, DeepSeek 4.7%, Moonshot 1.3%, Baichuan 0.4%, Yi 0.2% = 14.7% total Chinese.

**Agent Report** - Provides tabulated data from multiple sources:
- Jan 5, 2025: ~5% total Chinese
- Jul 14, 2025: ~28% total Chinese (peak)
- Nov 11, 2025: 14.7% total Chinese

Identifies gaps in weekly data between Nov 2025 and Apr 2026.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Chinese model share trajectory 2024-2025** - Most directly relevant. Shows rapid growth from 1.2% (late 2024) to peak of 28% (Jul 2025), then decline to 14.7% (Nov 2025). Suitable because it's the exact metric being measured.

2. **Technology adoption S-curves** - Less suitable. Chinese models may not follow typical adoption curves due to geopolitical factors, competitive responses from US companies, and regulatory considerations.

3. **Market share in competitive tech markets** - Moderately suitable. Could inform volatility expectations but lacks specificity to AI model usage patterns.

**Most suitable: Chinese model share trajectory 2024-2025** - Direct measurement of the same metric on the same platform with clear trend data.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** From Feb 16, 2026 (today) to week of Apr 19, 2026 = approximately 9 weeks ahead.

**Historical patterns over similar periods:**

Looking at 2-3 month windows in 2025:
- Jan-Mar 2025: Growth from ~5% to ~10-12% (estimated)
- May-Jul 2025: Rapid growth to 28% peak
- Jul-Sep 2025: Decline from 28% to ~20% (estimated)
- Sep-Nov 2025: Further decline from ~20% to 14.7%

The data shows high volatility with swings of 10+ percentage points over 2-3 month periods. The Jul 2025 peak of 28% appears to have been driven by DeepSeek R1 attention (Jan 2025 release) and subsequent Chinese model releases throughout H1 2025.

Post-peak (Jul-Nov 2025), there's a declining trend suggesting possible market correction, competitive response from US models, or normalization after initial adoption surge.

## (d) Justification

**Key factors for outside view:**

1. **Recent trend (Nov 2025-Feb 2026):** Last confirmed datapoint is 14.7% (Nov 11, 2025). Without data for Dec 2025-Feb 2026, we must consider whether the declining trend from Jul-Nov continued, stabilized, or reversed.

2. **Seasonal/cyclical patterns:** The Jul 2025 peak followed major releases (DeepSeek R1 in Jan, subsequent Chinese models). The decline may reflect market maturation. By Apr 2026, we're 15 months past DeepSeek R1's initial impact.

3. **Competitive dynamics:** Articles note US companies responding with faster releases. Alibaba's 20-day release cycle vs Anthropic's 47-day suggests sustained Chinese innovation, but US models (GPT-5, Gemini) maintain quality advantages in premium segments.

4. **Adoption drivers:** Cost-consciousness and startup usage favor Chinese models, but enterprise/regulated sectors favor US models. The 14.7% Nov figure may represent a more sustainable equilibrium than the 28% peak.

5. **Uncertainty factors:** 
   - No data for 3+ months (Nov 2025-Feb 2026)
   - Potential new model releases from either side
   - Geopolitical developments affecting usage
   - Platform-specific dynamics (OpenRouter user base evolution)

**Base rate estimate:** Given the declining trend from 28% (Jul) to 14.7% (Nov) and lack of recent data, a reasonable central estimate for Apr 2026 would be in the 12-20% range, with the Nov 2025 value of 14.7% as an anchor. However, high historical volatility (5-28% range observed in 2025) suggests wide uncertainty bounds.

Outside view calibration:

The question asks for Chinese model share on OpenRouter for the week of April 19, 2026, measured as total token count of Chinese authors divided by total (excluding "others").

**Anchoring considerations:**
- Last known value: 14.7% (Nov 11, 2025)
- 2025 YTD average: 13%
- Historical range: 1.2% (late 2024) to 28% (Jul 2025 peak)
- Recent 4-month trend (Jul-Nov): Declining from 28% to 14.7%

**Distribution calibration:**

The 9-week forecast period from today (Feb 16) to Apr 19 is relatively short, but the lack of data for the past 3+ months creates significant uncertainty. Historical volatility shows 10+ percentage point swings are possible over 2-3 month periods.

**Key considerations for percentiles:**

1. **10th percentile (pessimistic for Chinese share):** Could Chinese models decline further? Possible if US models release major updates or if the declining trend continues. However, the 13% YTD average and cost advantages suggest a floor around 8-10%.

2. **50th percentile (median):** Most likely near the Nov 2025 value of 14.7% or slightly lower/higher depending on whether decline continued or stabilized. Range: 12-16%.

3. **90th percentile (optimistic for Chinese share):** Could approach but unlikely to exceed the Jul 2025 peak of 28% without major new catalysts. New model releases or adoption surge could push to 22-26%.

**Tail considerations:**
- Lower tail: Unlikely to fall below 8% given established user base and cost advantages
- Upper tail: Unlikely to exceed 30% given the Jul 2025 peak of 28% represented an exceptional period

**Rate of upsets:** The AI model market has shown high volatility with rapid shifts in adoption. The DeepSeek R1 release caused a major surge. Similar unexpected developments could occur, warranting wider intervals than might seem necessary for a 9-week forecast.
