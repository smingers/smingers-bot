Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (key factual take-aways, date, quality)
1. SCMP (08 Dec 2025) – cites OpenRouter/a16z 100-T-token study; Chinese share averaged 13 % in 2025, peaked “nearly 30 %”.  Reputable mainstream outlet, secondary but data come from first-party platform.
2. TrendForce (26 Jan 2026) – quotes Nikkei: Chinese models ≈15 % of global share in Nov 2025 (method unspecified).  Credible but vague; moderate weight.
3. CNBC (04 Feb 2026) – reproduces current OpenRouter top-4 (Anthropic, Google, DeepSeek, Moonshot).  First-hand listing, good snapshot of Feb 2026 status (Chinese authors #3 + #4).
4. SCMP (09 Feb 2026) – announces imminent Qwen-3.5 release and other Chinese upgrades.  Forward-looking, sourced from GitHub commits; strong factual basis that new models will be available before April.
5. AskNews Chinese-language articles (16 Feb 2026) – multiple independent reports confirm launches of GLM-5, MiniMax M2.5, DeepSeek V4.  Same facts across outlets → consistent moderate evidence of a “release wave”.
6. CNN (11 Feb 2026) – expert quotes (Justin Lin, Tang Jie) saying gap with US remains; signals Chinese progress but not dominance.  Identifiable experts; qualitative, light weight.
7. OpenRouter PDF week of 11 Nov 2025 – hard number: 14.7 % combined for five major Chinese authors.  Highest-quality primary data point.

Factual vs opinion: numerical shares, release dates, price quotes = fact; projections (“unstoppable”) = opinion, discounted unless from named experts.

(b) Evidence weighting
Strong:
• Historical weekly peak ≈28–30 % after big Chinese releases (SCMP + chart) – shows ceiling is feasible.
• Confirmed imminent releases (Qwen-3.5, DeepSeek V4, GLM-5) before target week – structural driver that repeatedly produced surges.
Moderate:
• Current positioning (Feb 2026 top-4 list) – Chinese already ~two of top four; implies baseline mid-teens share.
• Huge cost advantage (0.30 $/M tok vs 4-10 $) – logical causal link to sustained usage growth.
Weak:
• Geopolitical chip constraints – real but long-term; negligible 2-month effect.
• Expert pessimism on “overtaking” US – affects years, not April week.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Time until resolution ≈ 9 weeks.  If window halved (≈1 month), less time for adoption → expect 1–2 pp lower share.  If doubled (≈18 weeks), more churn and possible U.S. counter-releases → distribution widens both tails.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift
Outside-view median 23 % derived from 2025 average (13 %), recent typical week (~15 %), and historical peak (~30 %).  
Inside-view upward adjustments:
1. Release wave exactly 2 months before measurement – past pattern shows 10–15 pp bumps for ~6-10 weeks after Chinese launches.  
2. Price gap against U.S. frontier models widened (Gemini 3 Pro 4.50 $ vs DeepSeek 0.30 $) – expect larger relative usage as orgs cut cost.  
3. Nothing comparable from U.S. slated for March-April aside from incremental GPT-5.2 dev preview; past U.S. launches have limited immediate cannibalisation of Chinese open-source demand on OpenRouter because pricing stays high.

Net: Shift mean/median up ~2–3 pp and fatten right tail.

Distribution calibration
I model weekly share as logit-normal with μ adjusted to give median ≈ 25 % and σ reflecting historical volatility (coefficient of variation ≈0.3).  Rounded percentiles:

Percentile 10: 13 %  – still possible lull if users don’t switch or surge fades fast  
Percentile 20: 17 %  
Percentile 40: 22 %  
Percentile 60: 26 %  
Percentile 80: 32 %  – requires sustained post-launch momentum similar to Jul 2025 peak  
Percentile 90: 38 %  – needs cumulative effect of multiple hit models + price cuts, plausible but low-prob.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: % of tokens credited to Chinese authors on OpenRouter during week starting 19 Apr 2026.  
2. Base rate distribution stated (median 23 %); final tied to it with moderate upward shift.  
3. Consistency check: implied mean ~25 %; matches logic and >13 % 2025 avg but <peak 30+.  
4. Key evidence: a) Historical 30 % peak after releases, b) Feb 2026 release wave confirmed, c) Current mid-teens baseline, d) Large cost advantage.  
5. Blind-spot: surprise GPT-5.2 price cut to parity could crash Chinese share (<15 %).  
6. Status-quo pull: without new uptake, share ≈15 %; my median 25 % is +10 pp, justified by release wave.  
7. Values strictly increasing, units %.
