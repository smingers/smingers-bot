    "description": "[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) is a popular service that unifies AI APIs, allowing users to access and easily switch between a large variety of models in exchange for a percentage fee on top of regular API costs.\n\nThe US and China have the world's most advanced AI industries and are often thought to be in a geopolitical struggle or \"race\" to develop powerful AI systems. Chinese models have improved rapidly over the past few years.&#x20;\n\nThe release of Deepseek R1 in January 2025 attracted substantial attention for attaining close to state of the art performance with a much lower training cost. Since then, Chinese models have continued to focus on efficiency and latency over pure performance.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41889,\"question_id\":41627}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as the total usage share of Chinese models on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/rankings) for the week of April 19, 2026.\n\nThis question will resolve based upon the Market Share graph section that shows per-author ranking, by summing the token count of Chinese model authors and dividing by the total token count excluding \"others\".",
    "fine_print": "A model author will be considered Chinese if the entity is incorporated or headquartered in the People's Republic of China.\n\nThis question will resolve based on the data shown for the week of April 19, 2026, after the data for the next week have first appeared. Further revisions after that will not reresolve this question.\n\nIf OpenRouter ceases to publish data, or the data for this question is otherwise unavailable before May 1, 2026, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n***\n\nThis question's information (resolution criteria, fine print, background info, etc) is synced with an [original identical question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41889) which opened on 2026-02-11 17:00:00.
