Analysis:
The outcome depends on how much traffic models from Chinese authors receive on OpenRouter eight weeks from now.  To form an inside view we need:

1. The most recent weekly “Market Share” figures on OpenRouter and how the Chinese authors’ share has been trending month-to-month.
2. News about any recent or imminent Chinese-authored model releases or upgrades (e.g., DeepSeek, Moonshot, Qwen, Baichuan, Minicpm) that might drive usage up before mid-April.
3. Information about policy or pricing changes on OpenRouter, or U.S.-based competitors (Anthropic, OpenAI, Mistral) that could pull share away from Chinese models.
4. Developer sentiment, latency/performance comparisons, or integration announcements that could shift traffic.

Recent tech-press articles, blog posts, and forum discussions often cover OpenRouter’s weekly rankings and announce when a new model “enters the top 10.”  Mainstream business outlets occasionally cover the U.S.–China AI “race,” but the most immediate data points usually appear on specialized AI news sites, GitHub discussions, and OpenRouter’s own changelog or X/Twitter feed.

Therefore, searches should combine:
• “OpenRouter rankings / market share” with “Chinese models” and date filters (Google).
• Recent news coverage highlighting Chinese model releases or adoption (Google News).
• A broader AskNews query that explicitly requests up-to-date information on Chinese model usage share and upcoming releases within the AI API aggregation industry.

2. Chinese AI models OpenRouter ranking February 2026 (Google News)
3. Provide the latest weekly token-share data for Chinese-authored models on OpenRouter and report any recently announced Chinese LLM releases or pricing changes likely to affect usage through April 2026. (AskNews)
