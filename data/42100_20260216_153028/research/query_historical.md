Analysis:
The core variable is the historical and recent usage share of Chinese-authored LLMs (e.g., Qwen, Deepseek, Baichuan, Moonshot, MiniMax, Zhipu, Yi) on the OpenRouter platform.  To build an outside-view baseline we need:  
1) Past weekly “Market share” graphs on openrouter.ai/rankings (to extract Chinese vs. non-Chinese token counts).  
2) News/reporting on OpenRouter trends and the competitive positioning of Chinese models, especially any inflection points (e.g., after Deepseek R1, Qwen-2, Baichuan-3, Moonshot v2).  
3) Commentary or data on OpenRouter’s user base growth and pricing that might differentially affect Chinese models.  

Therefore, the useful searches are:  
• Google web search for historical snapshots/cached versions of OpenRouter rankings.  
• Google News for coverage of Chinese models gaining share on OpenRouter.  
• Agent search to pull a current list of model authors flagged as Chinese and retrieve any archived Market-share images/JSON.  
(The question is not primarily macro-economic, so no FRED query.)
