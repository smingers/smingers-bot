You are currently doing research for historical information on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
What will be the Chinese model share on Openrouter for the week of April 19, 2026?

Question background:
[OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) is a popular service that unifies AI APIs, allowing users to access and easily switch between a large variety of models in exchange for a percentage fee on top of regular API costs.

The US and China have the world's most advanced AI industries and are often thought to be in a geopolitical struggle or "race" to develop powerful AI systems. Chinese models have improved rapidly over the past few years.&#x20;

The release of Deepseek R1 in January 2025 attracted substantial attention for attaining close to state of the art performance with a much lower training cost. Since then, Chinese models have continued to focus on efficiency and latency over pure performance.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-16. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-16 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

The lower bound is 15 and the upper bound is 45.
Both bounds are OPEN: outcomes can fall below the lower bound or above the upper bound. Your percentile estimates may extend beyond this range if well-supported by evidence.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic or financial data, add a FRED query. Use a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate") or a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE"). Returns historical data with computed statistics.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one Agent query.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant historical context needed to generate an outside view.}

Search queries:
1. your query here (Google)
2. your query here (Google News)
3. your query here (Agent)
4. economic indicator query (FRED) -- only if question involves economic/financial data
