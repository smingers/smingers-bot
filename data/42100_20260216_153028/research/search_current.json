These models emphasize reasoning efficiency, long-context understanding, low-cost inference, and multimodal integration. Key technical advancements include MoE (Mixture of Experts) architectures, FP8 precision, and optimized inference frameworks, reducing per-call costs from 'yuan' to 'fen'. The competition reflects a strategic shift from broad conversational AI to engineering-grade AI systems capable of end-to-end software development. This shift is driven by the 'Day 2 Problem'\u2014AI excels at generating code (Day 1) but struggles with sustainable, maintainable software engineering (Day 2). Industry leaders like OpenAI and Google are advancing specialized models (e.g., Gemini 3 Deep Think, GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark) to address this. Market demand is surging: IDC forecasts China\u2019s generative AI software market to reach $3.54 billion by 2025, with an additional $15 billion in latent demand unlocked by low-cost AI development. A positive feedback loop exists between models, products, users, and data. Large firms like Alibaba leverage ecosystem integration (e.g., Qwen in Alipay, Taobao) and open-source strategies (Apache 2.0) to build developer communities. Smaller players like MiniMax and Zhipu focus on vertical specialization\u2014MiniMax M2.5 targets high-throughput, efficient agent tasks with only 10B active parameters; Zhipu GLM-5 uses a 744B total / 40B active MoE design for optimal efficiency. The market is dividing: big tech dominates B2B with 90% projected market share in three years, while niche players thrive in specialized, high-knowledge domains. Despite progress, challenges remain: 'Agent Washing' (overhyping basic bots as agents), hallucinations, data silos, and the '80-point trap'\u2014where demos look good but real-world deployment fails. Success requires long-horizon capabilities: planning consistency, state management, error recovery, and cost optimization. The emergence of 'Agentic Engineering'\u2014using AI agents to manage full software lifecycles\u2014marks a paradigm shift. By 2027, AI tools could cover 80% of software development tasks, freeing developers for architecture and strategy. 2026 is seen as the turning point from 'explosion' to 'delivery'\u2014from talking to acting, from generating to orchestrating. Experts stress that AI Agent adoption hinges on solving reliability, cost control, and ethical compliance. As Beijing Academy of Social Sciences researcher Wang Peng notes, AI agents represent a qualitative leap from 'cognition' to 'action,' reshaping production and interaction models.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 04:00 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u6d6a\u8d22\u7ecf](https://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/roll/2026-02-15/doc-inhmwmvr8343697.shtml)\n\n**China's Open-Source AI Models Surge to 15% Global Market Share, Sparking Japan's Push for Domestic Alternatives**\nChinese-developed open-source generative AI models have risen to approximately 15% of the global market share by November 2025, up from just 1% a year earlier, according to data compiled by the U.S. AI tool platform OpenRouter and venture capital firm a16z, which measure AI model input/output volumes. Between November 2024 and November 2025, China\u2019s open-source AI market share averaged 13%, with some weeks reaching as high as 30%. Key models driving this growth include DeepSeek\u2019s R1, launched in January 2025, praised for achieving high performance at low cost, and Alibaba\u2019s Qwen (Qianwen), which is frequently updated. About 40% of Chinese AI models are used in advanced applications such as programming and design. Performance evaluations by Japan\u2019s NIKKEI Digital Governance ranked DeepSeek\u2019s model 9th out of 92 models in December 2025, first among open-source models, surpassing open-source models from Google and OpenAI. In Japan, 6 out of the top 10 AI models developed by Japanese companies, including those by ABEJA, are based on DeepSeek and Qwen. Japan\u2019s National Institute of Informatics (NII) also uses Qwen in its domestic AI project, LLM-jp. However, reliance on foreign open-source models poses risks, as changes in licensing terms can abruptly restrict development and usage. In response, Japan is initiating efforts to develop domestic open-source models, with the Ministry of Economy, Trade and Industry including support policies in its 2026 budget, aiming for a 1 trillion yen investment over five years, led by private firms like SoftBank. To be adopted in real-world business environments, Japan\u2019s AI must achieve performance competitive with leading U.S. and Chinese models, requiring advanced multimodal capabilities (handling text, images, and voice) and overcoming increasingly high technical barriers.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 19, 2026 01:07 AM\nSource:[Nikkei Chinese](https://cn.nikkei.com/china/ccompany/61045-2026-01-13-11-05-17.html)\n\n**WIRED Magazine: 2026 Will Be the Year of Alibaba's Qwen**\nOn December 29, 2025, WIRED, a leading global technology magazine, published a headline article titled 'Goodbye, GPT-5. Hello, Qwen.' The article states that despite GPT-5 failing to generate market excitement, Alibaba's Qwen\u2014open-source and highly flexible for deployment\u2014will dominate in 2026. According to WIRED, the true measure of an AI model's value lies not only in its intelligence but in its ability to enable the development of other applications. In this regard, Chinese open-source models like Qwen are clearly on the rise. Although models from OpenAI (GPT-5), Google (Gemini 3), and Anthropic (Claude) typically score higher, Qwen and other Chinese models such as DeepSeek remain in the top tier and are gaining increasing popularity due to their strong performance and developer-friendly flexibility. Data from Hugging Face, the world's largest AI open-source community, shows that Chinese open-source models surpassed American models in downloads by July 2025, with Qwen ranking first. Additionally, OpenRouter data on third-party API usage indicates that Qwen surged to fourth place globally in model call volume in 2025.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 29, 2025 01:32 PM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202512293604634071.html)\n\n**Geopolitical Tensions Cannot Hinder China's Rise in Low-Cost AI Models**\nAccording to a report released in early December by OpenRouter and Andreessen Horowitz, China's share of AI workloads globally rose from 1.2% at the end of 2024 to over 30% by early August 2025. This surge followed the release of DeepSeek's R1 model in mid-January 2025, which demonstrated performance comparable to top U.S. models, signaling China's growing maturity in generative AI. Unlike closed models such as OpenAI\u2019s GPT or Google\u2019s Gemini, DeepSeek-R1 and other Chinese large language models (LLMs) offer free downloads and open weights, enabling customization. Wang Wen from Renmin University told AFP that 'the world is increasingly choosing Chinese models due to their low cost\u2014sometimes even free\u2014and strong performance.' An anonymous U.S. entrepreneur reported saving $400,000 annually by using Alibaba\u2019s Qwen (Tongyi Qianwen) model for business applications, noting that while top-tier tech still comes from OpenAI, Anthropic, or Google, most use cases do not require it. Qwen is adopted by organizations including Perplexity, Nvidia, and Stanford University. Other popular Chinese models include GLM by Zhipu AI, MiniMax, and Moonshot\u2019s Kimi K2, which achieved breakthroughs in AI agent capabilities\u2014a domain previously considered a Chinese weakness. Despite the U.S. government\u2019s July roadmap supporting open-weight and open-source AI, major American firms have shown little interest: Meta has shelved its Llama models in favor of closed AI, and OpenAI only recently launched two GPT-oss open-weight models after six years of closed development. Mistral in France remains the only major Western firm committed to open-source, yet it lags far behind DeepSeek and Qwen in OpenRouter\u2019s popularity rankings. The entrepreneur noted that China actively encourages open-source models, which are more frequent and feature-rich than European counterparts. Mark Barton of Omniux Consulting acknowledged customer concerns over using Chinese models, especially amid Trump administration policies, stating, 'We don\u2019t want to be in a bind if a company is sanctioned.' However, Paul Triolo of DGA-Albright Stonebridge Group argued that data security is not a core issue, as companies can run these models on-premise without connecting to China. Stanford researchers recently concluded that open models allow deeper structural scrutiny, enhancing trust. High Fei of BOK Health agreed, stating that 'openness and sharing are the best way to build trust.' The Stanford study concluded that widespread adoption of Chinese models could 'redefine technology access pathways and dependencies,' while 'reshaping AI governance, security, and competitive dynamics.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 22, 2025 08:30 AM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/tw/%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B/20251222-%E5%9C%B0%E7%B7%A3%E6%94%BF%E6%B2%BB%E7%B7%8A%E5%BC%B5-%E4%B8%AD%E5%9C%8B%E5%BB%89%E5%83%B9ai%E6%A8%A1%E5%9E%8B%E4%BB%8D%E8%84%AB%E7%A9%8E%E8%80%8C%E5%87%BA)\n\n**Geopolitical Tensions Cannot Hinder China's Low-Cost AI Models from Gaining Global Ground**\nAccording to a report released in early December by OpenRouter and Andreessen Horowitz, China's share of global AI model usage in AI tasks rose from 1.2% at the end of 2024 to over 30% by early August 2025.
