## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Historical trend 2001-2014**: Three consecutive elections showing gradual increase (32.71% → 33.46% → 36.45%), ~1.5-2 points per cycle. Clear pattern with predictive power. *Direction: upward pressure, suggests 38-39% baseline.*
- **2020 COVID anomaly**: Multiple sources (Le Monde, IFOP, experts) confirm 55.34% was exceptional, 39% of abstainers cited COVID. Consensus that 2020 is not predictive. *Direction: expect reversion toward pre-COVID levels.*
- **Expert consensus on local vs. national**: Dabi (IFOP), Tiberj (Sciences Po), Pasquier (CNRS) all distinguish local attachment from national disgust. *Direction: moderating factor against extreme abstention.*

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Political crisis context**: Multiple sources reference "terrible political climate," 2024 dissolution, "chaos." Background states this explicitly. *Direction: upward pressure on abstention, +2-3 points.*
- **High perceived stakes**: ELABE poll shows 64% believe municipal elections impact daily life. *Direction: downward pressure on abstention.*
- **Geographic variation**: Tiberj notes large cities more politicized, will see higher abstention. Marseille 2020 had 67% vs. 58% national. *Direction: national average will mask significant variation.*
- **Undecided voters**: 33% undecided 2 months out (ELABE), Paris polls show 12-14% no voting intention. *Direction: uncertainty factor, could mobilize either way.*

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Procedural changes**: New uniform proportional system, Paris voting changes. Unclear impact, speculative.
- **Anecdotal reports**: Marseille residents expressing disillusionment. Limited geographic scope.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 26 days from today (2026-02-17) to election day (2026-03-15), resolution 2026-03-18.

**If halved (13 days):** Would increase uncertainty significantly. Last-minute campaign effects, weather, breaking news would have outsized impact. Would widen distribution by ~1-2 points on each tail.

**If doubled (52 days):** Would reduce uncertainty slightly. More time for trends to crystallize, campaigns to mobilize. Would narrow distribution by ~0.5-1 point on each tail. However, at 26 days, most structural factors are already locked in; campaigns have limited time to shift fundamentals.

**Current assessment:** 26 days is sufficient for structural factors to dominate but short enough that unexpected events (weather, scandal) could shift turnout by 1-2 points. Distribution should reflect this moderate uncertainty.

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate from Outside View:** 40-42% central tendency, 37.5-45.5% (10th-90th percentile)

**Key Adjustments:**

1. **Reversion from 2020 anomaly (Strong evidence)**: All expert sources and data confirm 2020's 55.34% was exceptional. This is not a "new normal" but a one-time shock. Justifies anchoring to 2014 (36.45%) rather than 2020.

2. **Continuation of secular trend (Strong evidence)**: 2001-2014 showed consistent upward drift (~1.5-2 points per cycle). Extrapolating: 36.45% + 2 points = 38.45% baseline. This is a structural factor (declining civic engagement) unlikely to reverse.

3. **Political crisis premium (Moderate evidence)**: Multiple sources document "terrible political climate," post-2024 dissolution chaos. However, experts (Dabi, Tiberj) note local elections partially insulated from national disgust. Estimate: +2-3 points above trend = 40-42% central case.

4. **Local attachment countervailing force (Moderate evidence)**: ELABE's 64% perceiving local impact, expert consensus on mayor popularity. Prevents extreme scenarios (45%+) but doesn't fully offset national malaise.

5. **Geographic heterogeneity (Moderate evidence)**: Large cities will see higher abstention (Tiberj), rural areas lower. National average will be pulled up by urban weight but moderated by rural participation.

**Distribution Calibration:**

The outside view's 40-42% central tendency appears well-justified. However, reviewing the evidence:

- **Lower tail risk (37-38%)**: Requires strong local mobilization overwhelming national factors. Possible but would require campaign effectiveness beyond historical norms. ELABE's 33% undecided could break favorably.

- **Upper tail risk (44-46%)**: Requires political crisis to deeply penetrate local elections despite expert consensus on insulation. Possible if crisis intensifies or weather/events suppress turnout.

**Adjustment rationale:** The outside view may be slightly optimistic on the lower tail. Given:
- Consistent upward trend since 2001
- Current political crisis is genuinely severe (dissolution, "chaos")
- Only 26 days for mobilization
- Urban areas (where most voters are) show higher abstention

I'll shift the distribution up by ~0.5-1 point across the board, reflecting that political malaise may have slightly more impact than the outside view credited.

## Distribution Calibration

**Revised Central Tendency:** 41-42% (up from 40-42%)

**10th Percentile (38%):** Optimistic scenario requiring:
- Strong local campaign mobilization
- Political crisis not transferring to local level
- Favorable weather
- High undecided break toward voting
This is plausible but requires multiple favorable factors aligning. Slightly above outside view's 37.5% to account for structural upward trend.

**20th Percentile (39.5%):** Moderately optimistic scenario:
- Trend continuation without crisis premium
- Modest local mobilization
- Some insulation from national politics
Roughly the trend extrapolation baseline.

**40th Percentile (41%):** Slightly below central case:
- Trend + modest crisis impact
- Average mobilization
- Typical campaign effectiveness

**60th Percentile (42.5%):** Slightly above central case:
- Trend + moderate crisis impact
- Below-average mobilization
- Political malaise has noticeable effect

**80th Percentile (44.5%):** Pessimistic scenario:
- Significant crisis spillover to local elections
- Weak mobilization despite high stakes
- Unfavorable conditions (weather, events)

**90th Percentile (46.5%):** Very pessimistic scenario:
- Deep political crisis overwhelming local factors
- Major demobilization
- Multiple negative factors
Still well below 2020's 55.34%, reflecting expert consensus that won't repeat.

**Range justification:** 38-46.5% (8.5 point spread) reflects:
- Historical 2001-2014 variability: 3.74 points
- Additional uncertainty from political crisis
- 26-day timeframe allowing some volatility
- Expert disagreement on crisis impact magnitude

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** National abstention rate (% of registered voters not voting) in first round, March 15, 2026, per Interior Ministry.
   - ✓ Analysis focuses on national abstention percentage.

2. **Base rate:** Outside view: 40-42% central, 37.5-45.5% (10th-90th).
   - ✓ Inside view (38-46.5%) rooted in this base rate with modest upward shift justified by political crisis evidence.

3. **Consistency:** Implied median ≈ 41.5%, mean ≈ 42%. 
   - ✓ Aligns with trend extrapolation (38-39%) + political crisis premium (2-3 points) + slight pessimistic bias from current evidence.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - Historical trend 2001-2014: consistent 1.5-2 point increases per cycle
   - Expert consensus: 2020 anomaly won't repeat, local elections partially insulated
   - Political crisis context: "terrible climate," post-dissolution chaos documented
   - ELABE poll: 64% see local impact, but 33% undecided suggests volatility
   - ✓ All factually grounded in identifiable sources.

5. **Blind spot:** Unexpected major mobilization campaign or celebrity mayor effect in final weeks could drive abstention to 37-38%. Would push outcome DOWN. Alternatively, major scandal/crisis in final week could push UP to 47-48%.

6. **Status quo:** 2014 level was 36.45%. Current situation involves genuine political crisis (not status quo), but 26 days is short for dramatic shifts. Slight nudge toward status quo already incorporated by keeping lower tail at 38% rather than 35%.

7. **Technicalities:** 
   - ✓ Percentiles strictly increasing
   - ✓ Units: % abstaining
   - ✓ Values within bounds (25-55 range, though open bounds)
