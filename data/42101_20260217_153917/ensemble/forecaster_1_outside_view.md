Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Agent Report (Historical Data Table):**
- Provides official Interior Ministry/INSEE data for French municipal elections 1977-2020
- High quality: cites primary government sources
- Key data points: 2014 (36.45% abstention), 2020 (55.34% abstention - COVID anomaly)
- Missing data for 1983, 1989, 1995 limits trend analysis
- Date: Current compilation (2026-02-17)

**ELABE Poll (January 10, 2026):**
- Professional polling institute, ~5 weeks before election
- Factual finding: "Historically, municipal elections have always mobilized more than 6 out of 10 registered voters (except 2020 in the Covid context)"
- This implies historical abstention typically <40% (except 2020)
- 64% believe municipal elections impact daily life (high perceived stakes)
- 33% undecided 2 months out suggests potential for mobilization shifts
- High quality, recent, relevant

**Frédéric Dabi/IFOP Interview (February 9, 2026):**
- Expert opinion from IFOP Director General (reputable polling institute)
- Identifies two competing scenarios: political fatigue (higher abstention) vs. local attachment (lower abstention)
- Notes distinction between national political disgust and respect for local officials
- Expert opinion but speculative; no quantitative prediction
- Very recent (8 days before forecast opening)

**Le Monde 2020 Article:**
- Documents 2020 anomaly: 53.5-56% abstention (settled at 55.34%)
- IFOP post-election survey: 39% of abstainers cited COVID fears
- Establishes 2020 as clear outlier, not predictive baseline
- Historical document, high quality

**Fondapol Historical Data (through 2014):**
- Average first-round abstention 1959-2014: 26.5%
- Provides long-term context showing gradual increase
- Pre-dates recent trends; limited relevance for 2026

**Fondapol Assembly Report:**
- Identifies structural causes: mal-inscription, loss of electoral clarity, protest abstention
- Notes crisis of democratic participation as chronic issue
- 2020-2021 context but discusses long-term trends
- Expert analysis but no 2026-specific predictions

**Other Sources:**
- Laviedesidees.fr: Discusses representativeness, not abstention
- Local articles (Metz, Paris): No national abstention predictions
- Limited direct relevance

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **All French municipal elections 2001-2020 (excluding 2020):**
   - 2001: 32.71%, 2008: 33.46%, 2014: 36.45%
   - Trend: gradual increase (~1.5-2 points per cycle)
   - Suitability: Good - captures recent secular trend, excludes COVID anomaly

2. **Pre-COVID municipal elections (2001-2014):**
   - Same as above, emphasizes "normal" conditions
   - Suitability: Very good - most relevant baseline

3. **All elections 1977-2020:**
   - 1977: 21.20% → 2014: 36.45% → 2020: 55.34%
   - Suitability: Moderate - too long timeframe, includes different political eras

4. **Recent French elections across types (2017-2025):**
   - Would capture current political disaffection
   - Suitability: Poor - different election types have different participation patterns

**Selected Reference Class:** French municipal elections 2001-2014, with consideration of post-2020 political context.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:**
- From today (2026-02-17) to election day (2026-03-15): 26 days
- Resolution: 2026-03-18 (3 days post-election)

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**
- Clear upward trend in abstention: 32.71% (2001) → 33.46% (2008) → 36.45% (2014)
- Average increase: ~2 points per 6-year cycle
- Linear extrapolation from 2014: 36.45% + 2 points = ~38-39% baseline

**Contextual Factors for 2026:**

*Factors suggesting higher abstention (toward 40-45%):*
- Political crisis following 2024 dissolution mentioned in background
- "Terrible political climate" noted in question background
- Fondapol report identifies chronic democratic participation crisis
- National political disgust (Dabi interview)
- Structural factors: political disaffection, weakened local attachments

*Factors suggesting lower abstention (toward 35-40%):*
- Reversion to pre-COVID norm expected
- Strong local attachment: 64% believe municipal elections impact daily life (ELABE)
- Respect for local officials vs. national politicians (Dabi)
- New voting system in Paris may generate interest
- Municipal elections historically mobilize better than other elections except presidential

*Neutral/Uncertain:*
- Procedural changes (uniform proportional system) - unclear impact
- 33% undecided 2 months out (ELABE) - could go either way

## (d) Justification

The most likely outcome is a **return toward pre-COVID trend levels with modest upward pressure** from current political malaise.

**Base rate calculation:**
- 2014 baseline: 36.45%
- Trend extrapolation: +1.5 to 2.5 points = 38-39%
- Political context adjustment: +1 to 3 points = 39-42%

**Central tendency:** 40-42% abstention appears most probable, representing:
1. Clear reversion from 2020's 55.34% anomaly
2. Continuation of long-term upward trend
3. Modest additional increase from political crisis context
4. But bounded by strong local attachment factor

**Uncertainty factors:**
- Extent of political disaffection spillover from national to local
- Effectiveness of local attachment as countervailing force
- Impact of new procedural rules
- Weather, last-minute events
- Historical variability: 2001-2014 showed 3.74 point range

**Tail risks:**
- Lower tail (35-37%): Strong local mobilization, rejection of national politics doesn't transfer
- Upper tail (45-48%): Deep political crisis overwhelms local factors, approaching but not reaching 2020 levels

The distribution should be centered around 40-42% with meaningful probability mass from 37-45%, reflecting genuine uncertainty about whether political malaise or local attachment dominates.

## Outside View Calibration

**Anchoring considerations:**
- Pre-COVID trend: 32-37% range (2001-2014)
- Trend extrapolation: 38-39%
- Political crisis premium: +2-4 points
- Expert opinion (ELABE): "always mobilized more than 6 out of 10" (historically <40% abstention except 2020)

**Distribution shape:**
- Should be roughly symmetric around 40-42%
- Modest right skew possible (easier to imagine crisis scenarios pushing higher than mobilization scenarios pushing much lower)
- 10th-90th percentile range should capture ~5-6 point spread minimum given historical variability

**Tail calibration:**
- 10th percentile: Should reflect optimistic scenario (strong local mobilization, minimal national spillover) → ~37-38%
- 90th percentile: Should reflect pessimistic scenario (significant political crisis impact) but well below 2020 anomaly → ~45-46%
- Avoid overconfidence: 2001-2014 showed 3.74 point range in "stable" conditions; current uncertainty is higher

**Rate of upsets in this domain:**
- 2020 was a genuine black swan (pandemic)
- Otherwise, municipal elections show gradual, predictable trends
- Major upsets rare but political context is genuinely uncertain
- Justifies moderately wide intervals
