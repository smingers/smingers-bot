Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical/Official Sources:**
- **INSEE series 001785275**: Official French statistical institute data for 2014 (36.5% abstention) and 2020 (55.3% abstention). Highest reliability, factual.
- **Fondapol historical chart**: Shows long-term trend 1959-2014, averaging 26.5% abstention through 2014. Reputable think-tank, factual compilation.
- **Interior Ministry decree (Aug 2025)**: Confirms election dates March 15/22, 2026. Official, factual.

**Recent News Articles (Feb 2026):**
- **Le Monde (Jan 22, 2026)**: Expert Romain Pasquier (CNRS/Sciences Po) characterizes 2020 as "election in weightlessness," notes 2026 is "first normal configuration since 2014." Identifiable expert opinion, moderate weight.
- **Le Dauphiné (Jan 24, 2026)**: Reports continuous abstention rise from 27.2% (1989) to 55.3% (2020), with only 2008 as exception. Factual historical summary.
- **France Bleu (Feb 16, 2026)**: Vincent Tiberj (Sciences Po Bordeaux) expects variable participation by commune size; large cities "politicized" with party confrontations, small communes focused on local issues with potentially "strong participation." Identifiable expert, nuanced opinion.
- **Multiple Paris polling articles (Feb 17, 2026)**: OpinionWay poll shows 12-14% "no voting intention" in Paris specifically. Single city data, limited national relevance.
- **Actu.fr (Feb 12, 2026)**: Notes 2014 had 60% participation (40% abstention) as better benchmark than 2020; cites 58% French confidence in municipal councils despite rising distrust. Factual with expert framing.
- **CNEWS (Feb 1, 2026)**: Reports 2020 first round 44.66% participation (55.34% abstention), down 19pp from 2014; second round 41.86% participation. Factual historical data.
- **Marseille-specific (Feb 5, 2026)**: 2020 saw 67% abstention in Marseille (vs 58% national), with some neighborhoods at 88%. Local example of structural disengagement.
- **Landes department (Jan 16, 2026)**: 2020 abstention 46.63% first round in Landes specifically. Regional data point.

**Expert Opinions Identified:**
- Romain Pasquier: 2026 will be first "normal" election since 2014
- Vincent Tiberj: Expects variable turnout by commune size, questions whether distrust will affect mayors
- Multiple sources: Mayors remain most popular political figures despite rising abstention

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Historical trend (1989-2014)**: Abstention rose steadily from 27.2% to 36.5%, approximately +0.4pp per year or +2.5pp per six-year cycle. Multiple official sources confirm. This suggests structural drift toward ~39-40% for 2026 absent shocks.
- **2020 COVID anomaly widely acknowledged**: Multiple expert sources (Pasquier, Tiberj, Actu.fr) explicitly state 2020 was exceptional and 2014 is better baseline. This supports reverting toward pre-COVID levels.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Persistent institutional distrust**: Actu.fr notes deepening distrust despite mayor popularity. However, this is partially offset by 58% confidence in municipal councils, suggesting mayors may be insulated from national malaise.
- **2021 regional elections**: Outside view mentions 66% abstention in regional elections (all-time high), suggesting COVID didn't fully reverse. However, regional elections historically have lower turnout than municipal.
- **Political climate**: Le Monde notes "paralyzed by chaos" campaign due to national instability. Could depress turnout moderately, but municipal elections traditionally focus on local issues.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Procedural changes**: New proportional system for all communes and Paris citywide voting. Effects unclear and likely cancel out.
- **City-specific polling**: Paris shows 12-14% undecided, but this is one city and doesn't indicate national abstention levels.
- **Marseille anecdotes**: High local abstention in 2020, but this is one city's pattern.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 26 days until March 15, 2026 first round.

**If halved (13 days)**: Minimal change. National abstention patterns are structural and don't shift significantly in final weeks. Last-minute campaign intensity might marginally affect turnout but unlikely to move national rate by more than 1-2pp.

**If doubled (52 days)**: Still minimal change. The key factors are long-term trends (decades) and whether COVID effects persist. An extra month wouldn't fundamentally alter the structural drivers.

The short timeframe means we're essentially forecasting a near-term outcome driven by factors already in place.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view baseline**: 41% abstention (mean), with 10th-90th percentile range of 34-49%.

**Factors supporting LOWER abstention (toward 36-39%):**
1. **Expert consensus on COVID reversal**: Multiple identifiable experts (Pasquier, Tiberj) explicitly state 2026 should revert toward "normal" pre-2020 patterns. The 2014 baseline of 36.5% abstention is repeatedly cited as more relevant.
2. **Mayor popularity**: Despite national distrust, mayors remain most popular political figures. Municipal elections traditionally mobilize better than other local contests.
3. **"Normal configuration" framing**: First normal election since 2014 suggests return to historical patterns rather than continuation of 2020 anomaly.

**Factors supporting HIGHER abstention (toward 42-46%):**
1. **Structural trend continuation**: The 1989-2014 upward drift suggests 2026 should be ~39-40% even without additional shocks, not a return to 2014 levels.
2. **2021 regional precedent**: Record 66% regional abstention suggests COVID may have accelerated existing disengagement trends rather than being purely temporary.
3. **Political climate**: National chaos and budget uncertainty noted by Le Monde could add 1-3pp to baseline structural abstention.
4. **Incomplete COVID recovery**: Even if 2020 was anomalous, full recovery to 2014 levels seems optimistic given persistent distrust trends.

**Net assessment**: The evidence suggests a modest upward shift from the outside view. While 2020 was clearly anomalous, expecting full reversion to 2014 (36.5%) ignores both the structural upward trend and potential COVID hangover effects. The 2021 regional result (though different election type) suggests abstention may stabilize at higher levels than pre-2020.

**Adjustment**: Shift center from 41% to 40%, narrowing the distribution slightly given expert consensus that 2020 won't repeat but acknowledging structural drift. This places median between the 2014 baseline (36.5%) and the structural trend projection (39-40%), with right tail capturing risk of deeper disengagement.

## Distribution Calibration

The outside view centered at 41% with wide uncertainty seems slightly pessimistic given expert consensus on COVID reversal. However, the structural trend and 2021 precedent prevent full reversion to 2014 levels.

**Calibrated distribution:**
- **10th percentile (34%)**: Optimistic scenario where mobilization returns to 2008 levels (~33.5%). Requires strong campaign and rejection of disengagement trends. Plausible but unlikely.
- **20th percentile (36%)**: Near 2014 levels. Assumes full COVID recovery and no acceleration of structural trends. Moderately optimistic.
- **40th percentile (39%)**: Structural trend projection. Most likely if "normal" conditions prevail with continued gradual drift.
- **60th percentile (42%)**: Incorporates some COVID hangover or political climate effects. Slightly above structural trend.
- **80th percentile (45%)**: Significant disengagement from national chaos or partial COVID persistence. Still well below 2020.
- **90th percentile (48%)**: Pessimistic scenario with multiple negative factors but not full 2020 repeat. Captures tail risk.

This distribution centers around 40% (between 39-42% interquartile range), acknowledging both the structural upward trend and expert consensus against 2020 repetition.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: National abstention rate (% of registered voters not voting) for March 15, 2026 first round of French municipal elections.
   ✓ Analysis focuses on national first-round abstention rate.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 41% mean, 34-49% (10th-90th percentile).
   ✓ Final prediction (40% center, 34-48% range) is anchored to this with modest adjustment based on expert consensus and structural trends.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 40%; mean ≈ 40.5%. This aligns with structural trend projection (39-40%) plus modest political climate adjustment. Makes sense given expert framing of "return to normal but not full 2014 reversion."

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - Historical trend: +2.5pp per cycle suggests ~39-40% for 2026 (strong, factual)
   - Expert consensus: 2020 was anomaly, 2014 is better baseline (strong, multiple identifiable sources)
   - 2021 regional precedent: 66% abstention suggests incomplete recovery (moderate, different election type)
   - Political climate: National chaos could add 1-3pp (moderate, expert opinion)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Unexpected mobilization crisis (terrorist attack, major scandal, extreme weather) in final week could spike abstention to 50%+ like 2020. Would push outcome UP significantly. Alternatively, unprecedented grassroots mobilization campaign could push DOWN to 33-35%.

6. **Status quo outcome**: The "status quo" is the structural trend toward ~39-40%, not the 2020 anomaly. Given 26-day timeframe and slow-moving nature of abstention patterns, slight bias toward this structural trend (39-40%) is appropriate.

7. **Technicalities**: 
   ✓ Values in % as requested
   ✓ Percentiles strictly increasing: 34 < 36 < 39 < 42 < 45 < 48
   ✓ All values within 25-55% bounds
   ✓ Units match (% abstaining)
