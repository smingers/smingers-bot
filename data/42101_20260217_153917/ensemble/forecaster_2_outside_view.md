Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Agent Report - Historical Turnout Data:**
High-quality compilation of official Interior Ministry and INSEE data. Provides documented first-round participation/abstention rates: 1977 (21.2% abstention), 2001 (32.71%), 2008 (33.46%), 2014 (36.45%), 2020 (55.34%). The 2020 figure is clearly anomalous due to COVID-19. Missing data for 1983, 1989, 1995 limits trend analysis but the available series shows steady decline from ~21% (1977) to ~36% (2014) abstention, then COVID spike to 55%.

**Fondapol Historical Article (pre-2014):**
Credible think-tank source. Reports 1959-2014 average first-round abstention of 26.5%. However, this average includes much earlier elections when participation was higher, making it less relevant for recent trends.

**Le Monde 2020 Article (March 15, 2020):**
Contemporaneous reporting of 2020 first round. Confirms 53.5-56% abstention estimate, attributed to COVID-19. City-specific rates: Le Havre 60.4%, Montpellier 65.3%, Nice ~71.4%. This was a 20-point jump from 2014's 36.45%.

**ELABE Poll (January 10, 2026):**
Recent, credible polling institute. Key factual statement: "Historically, municipal elections have always mobilized more than 6 out of 10 registered voters (except 2020 in the Covid context)." This implies historical abstention <40% (excluding 2020). Poll shows 64% believe municipal elections impact daily life, suggesting potential for reasonable turnout. 53% will vote on local issues only.

**France Bleu Interview with Frédéric Dabi, IFOP Director (February 9, 2026):**
Expert opinion from credible polling professional. Identifies two scenarios: (1) high abstention due to political fatigue, (2) lower abstention due to respect for local officials. Notes genuine affection for mayors versus national politicians. This is opinion but from a qualified expert.

**Fondapol Report on Abstention:**
Comprehensive analysis identifying structural causes: voter registration problems, loss of electoral clarity, protest abstention, declining partisan divides. Notes 2020's 58.4% second-round abstention as record. Emphasizes abstention is not solely COVID-related but part of broader trend.

**Other sources (Laviedesidees, Tout-Metz, Paris-specific articles):**
Provide context on local races and representation but limited direct relevance to national abstention rates.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **All French municipal elections 1977-2020:** Too broad - includes very different political eras and the COVID anomaly.

2. **Recent municipal elections (2001-2014):** Most suitable. Shows consistent 32-36% abstention range in modern era with similar political/social conditions. Excludes COVID anomaly but captures current democratic disengagement trends.

3. **All French local elections (municipal, regional, departmental):** Too heterogeneous - different stakes and voter engagement levels.

4. **Post-2017 French elections:** Captures recent political fragmentation and "gilets jaunes" era disaffection, but limited municipal-specific data.

**Selected reference class:** Recent municipal elections 2001-2014, adjusted for current political climate factors.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 26 days until March 15, 2026 first round.

**Historical pattern (2001-2014):**
- 2001: 32.71% abstention
- 2008: 33.46% abstention  
- 2014: 36.45% abstention
- Trend: +3.74 percentage points over 13 years (~0.29 points/year)
- 2020: 55.34% (COVID anomaly, excluded from trend)

**Key question:** Will 2026 revert to pre-COVID trend (~38-42% projected for 2026 based on 2001-2014 trajectory) or remain elevated due to:
- Political crisis following 2024 dissolution
- Structural democratic disengagement
- Political fragmentation and disaffection

**Countervailing factors suggesting lower abstention:**
- No COVID health crisis
- Local elections traditionally mobilize better than regional/European
- Respect for mayors remains high (per ELABE poll)
- New electoral system may generate interest in some cities
- 64% believe municipal elections impact daily life

**Factors suggesting higher abstention:**
- "Terrible political climate" since 2024 dissolution (per question background)
- Continued structural disengagement trends
- Political fatigue (per Dabi interview)
- Weakened local attachments

## (d) Justification

The outside view suggests 2026 will see partial reversion toward pre-COVID levels but not complete normalization. The 2001-2014 trend projected forward suggests ~38-40% abstention for 2026. However, the political crisis context and structural factors suggest elevation above this baseline.

The most likely scenario places 2026 abstention in the 40-48% range:
- Well below 2020's COVID-driven 55.34%
- Above the 2014 level of 36.45%
- Reflecting both reversion to normalcy and persistent elevated disengagement

The ELABE poll's statement that municipal elections "always mobilized more than 6 out of 10 registered voters (except 2020)" suggests professional forecasters expect <40% abstention, but this may be optimistic given current political climate.

## Outside View Calibration

**Anchoring considerations:**
- 2014 baseline: 36.45%
- 2001-2014 trend projection for 2026: ~38-40%
- COVID anomaly 2020: 55.34% (clear outlier)
- Expert expectation (implicit from ELABE): <40%

**Distribution shape:**
The distribution should be:
- Centered around 42-45% (modest elevation above pre-COVID trend)
- Right-skewed (higher abstention more likely than very low)
- Lower bound constrained by historical minimum (never below ~32% in modern era)
- Upper bound allowing for possibility of sustained crisis-driven disengagement

**Tail considerations:**
- 10th percentile: Optimistic scenario where political normalization and local attachment drive strong turnout - around 37-38%
- 90th percentile: Pessimistic scenario where political crisis sustains high disengagement - around 50-51%
- Extreme upset (>52%) possible but unlikely without external shock
- Extreme low (<35%) would require unprecedented reversal of trends

**Calibration to bounds:**
Question bounds are 25-55% (open). Historical data shows:
- Never below 21% (1977) in modern era
- Never above 36.45% pre-COVID
- 2020 reached 55.34% under extraordinary circumstances

My distribution should:
- Place minimal probability below 35% (would require reversal of 20-year trend)
- Place minimal probability above 52% (would require crisis worse than expected)
- Concentrate probability in 39-48% range

Outside View Calibration:
Given 26 days until resolution, the political climate is largely known. The distribution should reflect:
- Central tendency around 43-44% (modest elevation)
- Reasonable uncertainty range of ±6-7 points
- Asymmetric tails (easier to imagine higher than lower abstention)

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 37.5
Percentile 20: 39.5
Percentile 40: 42.5
Percentile 60: 45.0
Percentile 80: 48.0
Percentile 90: 50.5
