Analysis:
1) Target variable / resolution criteria (paraphrase)
National abstention rate (% of registered voters not voting) in the first round of France’s 2026 municipal elections (March 15, 2026), per Interior Ministry.

(a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; date)
- Le Monde (Jan 22, 2026): High-quality national outlet; frames 2026 as first “normal” municipal since 2014 (i.e., no Covid), but campaign “paralyzed” by national budget/political instability. Mostly expert commentary + context (not a turnout estimate).
- Le Dauphiné (Jan 24, 2026): Regional paper; paywalled; headline claims abstention “keeps rising” (with a stated 2020 figure). Limited usable detail beyond broad trend framing.
- ICI/France Bleu Nouvelle-Aquitaine (Feb 16, 2026): Credible public radio; includes named expert Vincent Tiberj (Sciences Po Bordeaux). Emphasizes heterogeneity by commune size; mayors still relatively trusted; key uncertainty is whether national dissatisfaction depresses local turnout. Expert opinion (helpful but not quantified).
- JDD / Le Parisien (Feb 17, 2026): Polling about Paris vote intention and “no voting intention” shares. Useful for “big-city politicization/fragmentation” context, but Paris-only and “no intention” ≠ abstention. Medium relevance to national abstention.
- Public Sénat (Feb 16, 2026): Serious outlet; compilation of big-city horse-race polling. No turnout numbers; indirect evidence that some large cities are competitive (could raise interest).
- Orange / Harris Interactive (Feb 16, 2026): Reports a Toluna-Harris survey: ~70% “interest” in municipals (in communes >1,000). Methodology not fully shown in excerpt; still a recognizable pollster. Interest is a weak-to-moderate proxy for turnout (intent/interest gaps are common).
- Actu.fr (Feb 12, 2026): Mentions abstention as a key challenge; discusses disinformation risk and parity/list constraints. Actu.fr is secondary; factual claims about institutions plausible; abstention discussion largely contextual.
- France Bleu Marseille (Feb 5, 2026): Anecdotal reporting from low-turnout neighborhoods; good for mechanism (disaffection) but not representative nationally.
- CentrePresseAveyron / La Dépêche (Feb 3, 2026): Retrospective on 2020 + cites “Destin commun” 2025 finding: 60% “already resolved to vote” in 2026. Local outlets, but the key item is the cited study; without full methodology it’s suggestive rather than definitive.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted factors and directional pull)
Strong evidence
- Historical municipal baseline (2001–2014): abstention ~33–36% (with 2014 at 36.45%). Strongly predictive reference class once we exclude Covid-shock 2020. Pulls toward high-30s/low-40s abstention.

Moderate evidence
- Current political instability/budget uncertainty (Le Monde; echoed broadly): plausible mechanism for demobilization (“chaos,” fatigue). Likely pushes abstention upward by ~1–3 points versus a simple trend extrapolation.
- Poll-reported interest/intent signals (Toluna-Harris “70% interested”; Destin commun “60% resolved to vote”): directionally suggests meaningful reversion from 2020’s extreme abstention. But intention→turnout slippage is nontrivial, especially among younger/less attached voters. Pulls abstention downward versus a “still-very-high” narrative.

Weak evidence
- Big-city competitiveness (Public Sénat; Paris polling): could modestly reduce abstention in major metros, but national effect diluted because small/medium communes dominate and have different dynamics.
- Anecdotal neighborhood disaffection (France Bleu Marseille): supports an “upper-tail” risk (persistent very high abstention in some urban zones) but weak for national point estimate.

Net effect vs outside view
- Outside view center (~44%) already embeds “partial reversion + some structural malaise.” New information mostly reinforces that framing: no Covid (downward force) but political chaos persists (upward force). I therefore keep the center close to the outside view, with a slightly heavier upper tail (because instability + distrust could bite late, and urban abstention can be very high even in “normal” times).

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left: 26 days until first round (March 15).
- If timeframe were halved (~13 days left): I’d tighten uncertainty slightly (campaign dynamics and final mobilization signals would be clearer), but the median would likely stay similar unless a major national shock occurs.
- If timeframe were doubled (~52 days left): I’d widen the distribution (more room for shocks: major scandal, security crisis, abrupt government collapse, major disinformation episode, etc.), with a slightly higher 90th percentile.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside-view base rates)
Outside view base rate distribution (given): P10 37.5, P20 39.5, P40 42.5, P60 45.0, P80 48.0, P90 50.5.

Key pushes:
- Downward from “high 40s/50s”: 2020’s abstention was Covid-driven; multiple sources frame 2026 as first “normal” municipal since 2014; poll-reported interest/intent suggests many voters plan to participate.
- Upward from “return to 2014”: national political instability since dissolution + budget uncertainty plausibly depresses turnout; long-run disengagement trend likely not fully reversed; persistent very-high abstention pockets in large cities (even pre-Covid) keep the national mean elevated.

Result: maintain a central estimate in the mid-40s, but widen slightly and lift the upper tail a bit compared with the outside view (reflecting uncertainty about whether national chaos meaningfully suppresses turnout).

Distribution calibration
- I set the median/central mass essentially unchanged (mid-40s), with:
  - a slightly lower 10th percentile (credible “good mobilization” scenario back toward 2014 levels), and
  - a slightly higher 90th percentile (credible “political-fatigue + chaos” scenario keeping abstention near/above 2020-minus-Covid levels, though still usually below 2020).

Checklist:
1) Variable: % abstaining among registered voters nationally, first round March 15, 2026, Interior Ministry.
2) Outside view base rates: (37.5, 39.5, 42.5, 45.0, 48.0, 50.5).
3) Consistency: implied median ≈ 44.0; mean ≈ 44.5; consistent with “partial reversion from 2020 + instability premium.”
4) Key evidence (most influential):
   - Pre-Covid municipals clustered ~33–36% abstention (2001–2014).
   - 2020 abstention largely attributable to Covid shock (not present in 2026).
   - Post-2024 instability/budget uncertainty plausibly demobilizes some voters.
   - Poll-reported interest/intent suggests many plan to vote, but intent→turnout gap remains.
5) Blind spot: A major late national crisis (security/economic) or major legitimacy/disinformation episode could spike abstention upward.
6) Status quo: absent shocks, expect mid-40s abstention (higher than 2014, far below 2020).
7) Technicalities: percentiles strictly increasing; units are %; tails reasonably wide.
