Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; fact vs opinion)

1. **Le Monde (Jan 30, 2026) – Paris mayoral race / Sophia Chikirou**
   - **What it contains (facts):** Candidate positioning and recent electoral scores in Paris; notes the new Paris electoral system may affect competitiveness.
   - **Relevance to abstention:** Indirect only (competitiveness can affect turnout locally).
   - **Quality/date:** High-quality mainstream outlet; recent; but **not evidence on national abstention**.

2. **Fondapol “chiffres de l’abstention depuis 1959” (pre-2014 retrospective)**
   - **Facts:** Provides long-run historical averages for municipal abstention (through 2014) and typical first/second-round differences.
   - **Quality/date:** Serious think-tank compilation; however, it’s **older**, and its **headline “average 26.5%”** mostly reflects an earlier era of higher turnout (less representative of the 2000s–2010s baseline).

3. **La Vie des Idées (Feb 17, 2026) – representativeness of local elected officials**
   - **Facts:** Strong statistical claims about the socio-professional composition of municipal councils in Seine-Saint-Denis over time.
   - **Relevance:** Indirect; it supports a narrative of professionalization and social-distance that *could* correlate with disengagement, but it **does not measure turnout**.
   - **Quality/date:** Credible intellectual journal; recent; not directly usable as turnout data.

4. **Fondapol report for the National Assembly (abstention causes; partial extract)**
   - **Facts:** Notes record abstention in 2020 municipal second round (58.4%) and high abstention in 2021 regionals; lists structural drivers (registration issues, “protest abstention,” etc.).
   - **Opinion/analysis:** Interprets abstention as chronic and multi-causal.
   - **Quality/date:** Policy/think-tank report; useful qualitative framing; **not a forecasting model** and extract is incomplete.

5. **Le Monde (Mar 15, 2020) – municipal results disrupted by COVID**
   - **Facts:** Describes 2020 as a COVID-disrupted election; cites polling-institute estimates for abstention election night.
   - **Quality/date:** High-quality outlet, but election-night estimates can differ from final official figures. Still good context for the “shock” nature of 2020.

6. **ICI / France Bleu (Feb 9, 2026) – interview with IFOP’s Frédéric Dabi**
   - **Facts:** None quantitative on national abstention; describes two scenarios (fatigue/disgust vs local attachment).
   - **Opinion:** This is **expert judgment** by a named, relevant professional (pollster). Useful for mapping scenario space, not for anchoring a base rate.

7. **Tout-Metz (Feb 14, 2026) – reader survey announcement**
   - **Facts:** Self-selected local survey; explicitly not representative.
   - **Usefulness:** Essentially none for national abstention.

8. **ELABE (Jan 10, 2026) – municipal-election attitudes**
   - **Facts:** 64% say municipals impact daily life; 53% say they’ll vote on local issues only; also claims municipals historically mobilize >60% except 2020.
   - **Quality/date:** Reputable pollster; recent; however, the “>60% historically” is a broad generalization and not a precise forecast for 2026 abstention.

9. **Agent report – table of first-round participation/abstention (selected years)**
   - **Facts:** Provides a compact series with **INSEE** values for 2014 (36.45% abstention) and 2020 (55.34%); and reported Interior Ministry figures for 2001/2008; plus 1977.
   - **Quality:** Best single quantitative anchor here because it cites **INSEE series 001785275** for the key modern points. Missing national values for 1983/1989/1995 limits long-run trend fitting, but we still have a solid **2001–2014 pre-COVID baseline** and the **2020 outlier**.

### (b) Reference class analysis (candidates; suitability; chosen class)

**Candidate reference classes**
1. **French municipal elections, first round, pre-COVID modern era (2001, 2008, 2014)**  
   - Abstention: **32.71%, 33.46%, 36.45%** (steady rise).
   - **Pros:** Same election type; closest “normal operations” baseline.
   - **Cons:** Only three points; may understate post-2017 / post-2024 political disaffection effects.

2. **French municipal elections, first round, including 2020**
   - Adds **55.34%** (COVID shock).
   - **Pros:** Captures possibility that high abstention can occur.
   - **Cons:** 2020 is widely acknowledged as an **exogenous shock**, not a “typical” draw from the same process.

3. **Other French “midterm/local” elections post-2020 (e.g., 2021 regionals)**
   - **Pros:** Captures structural abstention trends in the 2020s.
   - **Cons:** Different salience/electoral mechanics; municipals traditionally have higher turnout than regionals.

**Chosen reference class for an outside view baseline:**  
**(1) Pre-COVID municipal first rounds (2001–2014), trend-extrapolated to 2026**, while allowing a **fatter upper tail** than pre-2020 because the 2020s have demonstrated vulnerability to high-abstention equilibria (even if 2020 itself was exceptional).

---

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time until outcome is known:** first round is **March 15, 2026**; from today (Feb 17, 2026) that’s **~26 days**.
- For an **outside view**, the short time-to-election mainly means: there’s limited time for major structural changes, but **idiosyncratic shocks** (security event, scandal, weather, etc.) can still move turnout at the margin. Historically, however, national municipal abstention tends to be relatively stable absent a large shock (with **2020** the salient counterexample).

---

### (d) Justification (outside view baseline → point/range implications)

**Baseline trend from the best-matched pre-COVID reference class (2001→2014):**
- Abstention rose from **32.71% (2001)** to **36.45% (2014)**: +3.74 points over 13 years ≈ **+0.29 points/year**.
- Extrapolating 2014 → 2026 (12 years): +3.5 points → **~40.0% abstention** as a mechanical outside-view trend estimate.

**How to reflect the 2020s “high abstention regime” risk without over-weighting COVID:**
- 2020 (55.34%) is not a reasonable central estimate, but it is strong evidence that municipal abstention can jump dramatically under adverse conditions.
- Post-2020 French politics has also featured high disaffection narratives; even if municipals are “more local and mobilizing,” the distribution should be **right-skewed** relative to the 2001–2014 pattern.

**Therefore (outside view):**
- Center the distribution around **~41–43%** (some worsening vs 2014, but not a 2020-repeat).
- Use a **wide** 10–90 interval to reflect unknown unknowns and the demonstrated possibility of unusually high abstention.

Outside view calibration:

- **Anchors/tethers:** INSEE official figures for 2001/2008/2014/2020 imply (i) a pre-COVID baseline in the mid-30s and (ii) the existence of rare but extreme outcomes.
- **Upset rate / tail behavior:** Turnout is usually sticky, but can be shock-sensitive (2020). So I keep a **fat upper tail** (possibility of high 40s to ~50), while the lower tail assumes “reversion to municipals’ traditionally higher turnout” could still happen (mid-30s abstention).
- **Shape:** Slightly right-skewed (more room above the median than below), reflecting structural disaffection risk.
