Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological sample, most relevant to turnout)

1. INSEE “001785275” official series (2001-2020). Facts: first-round abstention 32.7 % (2001), 33.5 % (2008), 36.5 % (2014), 55.3 % (2020). High-quality, definitive.  
2. Le Monde 22 Jan 2026. Facts: 2020 called an “election in weightlessness”, experts expect 2026 to be first “normal” test since 2014. Opinion from CNRS scholar (Pasquier) that turnout should rebound. Recent, credible.  
3. Toluna-Harris survey 16 Feb 2026. Facts: 70 % of registered voters in >1000-hab. communes say they are interested; 39 % positive to a civil-society mayor. Methodology disclosed. Interest ≠ turnout but a useful proxy (moderate evidence).  
4. Sciences Po Political Confidence Barometer (cited France Bleu 16 Feb 2026). Facts: trust in institutions down fifteen years; mayors still best-rated. Indirect, suggests mixed forces on abstention (moderate).  
5. Actu.fr 12 Feb 2026. Facts: Government highlights rising abstention as a key challenge; 58 % still trust municipal councils. Weak direct forecasting value.  
6. Le Dauphiné 24 Jan 2026. Facts: long-run upward abstention trend (27 % → 55 % 1989-2020). Historic data, quality OK.  
7. IFOP director Dabi interview (France Bleu 9 Feb 2026). Opinion: sees two plausible scenarios—return to 40 % range or persistently high (~45-50 %). Identifiable expert.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong: INSEE historical pattern; consensus that 2020 was an outlier; structural upward drift of ~0.3 pt/yr since 2001.  
Moderate: Polls showing high declared interest; expert interviews discussing disaffection; new uniform list rule may depersonalise races.  
Weak: Local anecdotes (Marseille neighbourhood apathy); city-specific horse-race polls; weather uncertainty.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome in 26 days.  If only 13 days remained, little would change; if 52 days remained, a late scandal or security event could still add ±1-2 pts to abstention.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
1. Reversion from COVID shock very likely (strong evidence) → pulls abstention down toward ~40 %.  
2. Long-term creep + national political malaise (moderate) → adds ~2-3 pts.  
3. Uniform proportional lists reduce local personal ties (moderate) → +0.5-1 pt.  
4. High stated interest (moderate, could be over-reported) → −1 pt.  
Net effect relative to outside-view median (~41 %) ≈ +2 pts ⇒ new median ≈ 43 %.  
Tails kept fat because an unforeseen security or health shock (terror, epidemic flare) could still push >50 %, while a mobilisation surge in small communes could still take us back to mid-30s.

Distribution calibration
Implied median: 43 %; mean ~43.6 % (right-skew); aligns with trend + modest pessimism.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: national first-round abstention, % of registered voters, 15 Mar 2026.  
2. Base-rate distribution stated above and used.  
3. Consistency line: “Implied median = 43 %; mean ≈ 43.6 %; plausible with justification.”  
4. Key evidence: (i) INSEE 2001-2014 upward drift, (ii) 2020 labelled outlier by experts, (iii) polling shows 70 % interest, (iv) trust in mayors highest, (v) new proportional list rule may dampen mobilisation.  
5. Blind-spot: major election-week security incident depressing turnout nationwide → would push abstention into upper 40s/low 50s.  
6. Status-quo outcome (no COVID) ≈ 40 % abstention; distribution nudged upward but still centres near that.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, units = %.
