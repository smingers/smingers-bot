Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. INSEE statistical series 001785275 and Interior-Ministry communiqués (2001-2020).  
   • Official, nationwide, final counts. Pure fact, high reliability. Dates contemporaneous with each election.  
2. Le Monde (15 Mar 2020). Gives the 2020 first-round abstention (≈55 %). Factual numbers taken from polling institutes, opinion portions clearly separated. Quality: high-tier newspaper, but we already prefer INSEE for the number itself.  
3. Fondapol “Les chiffres de l’abstention depuis 1959”. Historical review through 2014; average first-round abstention 26.5 %. Author is a respected think-tank; numbers trace back to TNS Sofres / Interior Ministry. Good for long-run context.  
4. Fondapol report to the National Assembly on abstention (2022). Mainly analytical opinions; it confirms that 2020 cannot be reduced solely to COVID and underlines structural drivers. Useful for identifying potential upward drift, but its numerical content is thin.  
5. ELABE national poll (10 Jan 2026). States that “municipal elections usually mobilise more than 6 out of 10 voters (except 2020)”. That is a factual synthesis, source is a major polling institute. No concrete forecast, but reiterates pre-COVID baseline.  
6. IFOP interview, Frédéric Dabi (9 Feb 2026). Opinion of an identifiable expert: turnout could go either way, with arguments on “political disgust” vs. “affection for mayors”. No numbers, but flags uncertainty.  
7. Academic article on representativeness of councillors; Tout-Metz self-selected survey. Neither contains turnout data; they are ignored for the baseline.  
8. Agent-report table (1977-2020). Compiles official figures and explicitly flags the three missing years. Quality adequate; gaps noted.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
• All French municipal first rounds since 1977 (10 observations).  
• Only the last three pre-COVID elections (2001, 2008, 2014).  
• All local elections (municipal, departmental, regional) 2000-2024.  

The best fit is “French municipal first rounds 2001-2014”, because (i) municipal elections share distinctive participation patterns (higher than other local contests), (ii) post-2000 captures the modern electorate and downward drift, and (iii) it omits the COVID outlier while still giving three data points (32.7 ; 33.5 ; 36.5 % abstention).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time until resolution: 26 days.  Experience from earlier cycles shows national turnout numbers do not swing wildly in the final month; most of the secular movement accumulates over years.  From 1977 to 2014 abstention climbed about 15 pp in 37 years (~0.4 pp per year); between consecutive elections the change ranged from +0.8 to +3.0 pp.  Therefore, today’s outside view should mostly reflect that long-term slope, not short-term news.

(d) Justification for the outside-view number  
Structural trend: extrapolating the +1.0 pp per six-year cycle seen 2001→2008→2014 would put a “no-COVID 2020” at ~37.5 % and a 2026 election at ~39-40 %.  
COVID hang-over: surveys and 2021 regional turnout show only partial re-mobilisation (regional abstention 66 %, an all-time high).  That argues for a modest upward adjustment to the 39-40 % base, but not a repeat of the 55 % spike.  
Rule-changes: extension of proportional lists and direct mayoral vote in Paris both cut both ways (could stimulate or depress interest) and are judged roughly neutral in the baseline.  
Expert priors: ELABE’s phrasing (“more than 6 in 10 voters” participate) implies abstention below 40 %; IFOP flags genuine uncertainty.  Markets and betting exchanges are absent, so expert expectations hover around the high-30s/low-40s.  
Upset frequency: in the nine pre-2020 contests the maximum jump between two elections was 3 pp; 2020 was a 19 pp outlier triggered by an extraordinary shock.  Allowing 10 % probability for a new, unforeseen macro-shock seems prudent.

Combining these pieces, the outside-view centre of gravity is placed at roughly 41 % abstention, with a long right tail to acknowledge low-probability shocks and a shorter left tail for a (less likely) re-mobilisation to late-1990s levels.

Outside view calibration:

Distribution anchored to mean ≈41 %, st.dev. ≈4.5 %.  This reproduces the historical inter-election variability while leaving extra mass in the extreme right tail for “black-swan” demobilisation.  Percentiles rounded to whole numbers for clarity; all are strictly increasing.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 34  
Percentile 20: 36  
Percentile 40: 39  
Percentile 60: 42  
Percentile 80: 46  
Percentile 90: 49
