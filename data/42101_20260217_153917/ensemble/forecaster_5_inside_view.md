Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most weight-bearing first)

1. INSEE series 001785275 (last update 2024). Official Interior-Ministry numbers for every municipal election since 2001. Highest reliability; purely factual.  
2. Fondapol “Les chiffres de l’abstention depuis 1959” (2014). Think-tank report, aggregates Interior-Ministry data back to 1959. High quality; useful for long-run trend.  
3. Le Monde 22 Jan 2026 background piece. Reputable newspaper, quotes political scientist Romain Pasquier; confirms 2020 was a “weightlessness” Covid outlier and reminds 2014 participation 63.6 %.  
4. Actu.fr 12 Feb 2026 “Abstention, parité, désinformation…”. Cites 58 % of French still trust their municipal councils and recalls 2020 abstention 55.3 %. Moderate reliability; distinguishes fact from commentary.  
5. Toluna-Harris Interactive poll for RTL 16 Feb 2026. Representative national survey (n≈2 000). 70 % of registered voters in communes >1 000 hab. declare “interest” in the coming election. Single, transparent methodology ⇒ moderate evidence.  
6. France Bleu Marseille 5 Feb 2026 field report. Anecdotal interviews from high-abstention districts; weak evidence but illustrates persistent disengagement in big cities.  
7. Ifop interview (quoted in La Provence 2 Feb 2026). Pollster François Kraus notes systematic lower turnout in large cities. Moderate, expert opinion.  
8. Misc. horse-race polls (Paris, Nîmes, etc.). Do not measure turnout; only confirm campaigns are competitive. Low relevance to resolution.  

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong:  
• Pre-Covid trend: abstention +0.4 pp/year 1977-2014 (sources 1, 2)  
• Covid shock removed ⇒ expect rebound versus 2020 (sources 1, 3)  

Moderate:  
• Sustained disaffection since 2021 regional (33 % turnout) and 2022 & 2024 legislatives (≈52 % abst.) shows “new normal” higher than 2014 (sources 1, electoral data)  
• 70 % “interest” figure (source 5) suggests middling mobilisation (~55 % turnout historically corresponds to c. 70 % “interest”).  
• Large-city disengagement persists (sources 6, 7) and those communes now all vote by proportional list (institutional change could confuse some voters).  

Weak:  
• Local anecdotes, candidate quarrels, weather unknown.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
26 days until polls open; last-month swings >6 pp are historically <10 % likely. Halving the time window (13 days) would hardly change the forecast; doubling (52 days) would add a little uncertainty but not shift the central estimate.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments starting from outside-view baseline 43 % abstention (mean, σ≈5 pp):

+2 pp  Persistent national political distrust 2021-24.  
+1 pp  Uniform proportional lists everywhere & capital-wide votes raise complexity.  
–1 pp  Covid fear gone, habitual municipal attachment still strongest among French institutions.  
≈ +2 pp net shift ⇒ centre 45 %.  
Keep σ slightly wider (6 pp) because of extraordinary political climate and possible late-campaign scandals.

Distribution calibration
I fit a normal‐ish distribution with mean 45 %, SD 6 %, then fatten tails by hand to reflect 10 % probability below 37 % (strong re-mobilisation) and 10 % above 53 % (near-Covid relapse).

Checklist:
1. Target variable: % of registered voters abstaining nationwide in 1st round on 15 Mar 2026, as reported by Interior Ministry.  
2. Outside-view distribution: mean 43 %, SD ≈5 %.  
3. Consistency check: implied median 45 %, mean 45 %; aligns with above reasoning.  
4. Key evidence:  
   – Long-term +0.4 pp/year abstention trend.  
   – 2020 Covid outlier will partly revert.  
   – 2021-24 elections show sustained high abstention (>50 %).  
   – 70 % “interest” poll ⇒ turnout roughly mid-50s ⇒ abst. mid-40s.  
   – New proportional-list rule could depress turnout slightly.  
5. Blind-spot: Major corruption scandal or terror alert in early March depressing turnout another 8-10 pp upward.  
6. Status-quo (trend) outcome ≈43 %; I nudged slightly higher (45 %) but kept wide tails.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units = percent; all within 25–55 open range but allow upper tail to hit 55.
