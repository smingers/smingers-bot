Analysis:
(a)  Source analysis  
1. Fondapol “chiffres de l’abstention depuis 1959” (2014).  Factual time-series compiled from Interior-Ministry data, peer-reviewed think-tank, good for the long-run trend until 2014.  
2. INSEE statistical series 001785275 (updated 2024).  Official statistics office, highest reliability; gives the national first-round abstention for 2001-2020.  
3. Le Monde 15 Mar 2020 election-night article.  Reputable newspaper; the numbers quoted match INSEE/Interior data; useful to confirm the Covid outlier and reasons (39 % citing virus fears).  
4. Fondapol 2022 report for the National Assembly.  Good quality research; pinpoints structural causes of rising abstention (mal-inscription, loss of partisan clarity, protest vote).  
5. IFOP radio interview 9 Feb 2026.  Credible pollster, but mostly qualitative “two scenarios”; no hard turnout figures yet.  
6. ELABE national poll 10 Jan 2026.  Large-sample professional survey; contains one factual line: “municipal elections have always mobilised more than 6/10 voters except 2020”.  That is not a forecast but a reminder of the historic norm.  
7. Agent report table (Interior-Ministry / INSEE).  Consolidates official numbers 1977-2020; gaps flagged for 1983-1995, otherwise hard data.

(b)  Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• All municipal first-round abstention rates 1977-2020 (n=8).  
• 2001-2014 municipals only (last three ‘normal’ elections before Covid).  
• Post-Covid local elections (2021 regional, 2022 & 2024 legislatives).  
The target variable is the same as the first class, so that is the natural reference.  However, 2020 is an acknowledged outlier.  Removing it leaves a 1977-2014 mean of 29.0 % and a pre-Covid trend of +0.4 pp per year.  I therefore adopt “municipal elections 1977-2014 with linear trend extrapolated to 2026” as the principal reference class.

(c)  Time-frame analysis  
Today is 17 Feb 2026; first round is 15 Mar 2026, 26 days away.  Turnout intention polls usually move by only a few points in the final month unless a shock intervenes; historically, last-month swings >6 pp are rare (≈10 % of cases in French national elections).

(d)  Justification for the outside view  
Baseline from trend: 2014 abstention 36.5 % + (12 years × 0.4 pp) ≈ 41 %.  
Adjustments:  
+2 pp Structural disaffection documented by Fondapol and confirmed by high abstention in 2021-2024 elections.  
–1 pp Covid fear gone; local offices still enjoy higher trust than national (IFOP interview).  
+1 pp administrative change to proportional lists (more complex, risk of voter confusion).  
Net outside-view centre ≈ 43 %.  Historical volatility (σ ≈ 5 pp, excl. 2020) suggests a 10–90 range about ±10 pp.  Because a repeat of the Covid-level 55 % is possible but unlikely without a comparable shock, I put only a 10 % chance on ≥52 %.  Likewise, a sharp re-mobilisation below 35 % looks improbable but not impossible (10 % chance).

Outside view calibration:
• Anchor distribution on mean 43 %, SD ≈5 %.  
• Impose fatter tails (history of “upsets” roughly 1 election in 8 > 6 pp from trend).  
• Convert to percentiles ensuring monotonic increase.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 34  
Percentile 20: 37  
Percentile 40: 40  
Percentile 60: 44  
Percentile 80: 49  
Percentile 90: 53
