You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
What will be the abstention rate in the first round of the 2026 French municipal elections?

Question background:
French municipal elections are held every six years to elect municipal councillors, who then elect mayors. Elections are scheduled for March 15, 2026 (first round), and March 22, 2026 (second round), as established by [Décret n° 2025-848 of August 27, 2025](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/).

The 2020 election was anomalous: held during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the first round (March 15, 2020) saw a record-low participation under 45%. Approximately 39% of abstentionists cited coronavirus fears as their primary reason for not voting.

A key question in French politics right now is whether 2026 will revert toward the pre-COVID trend (\~38-42%) or whether structural factors (political disaffection, weakened local attachments) and the overall terrible political climate in the country since the 2024 dissolution will maintain higher abstention levels.

Two procedural changes have been implemented this time around. New uniform proportional list system now applies to all communes (previously only those >1,000 inhabitants) and Paris, Lyon, and Marseille now elect city-wide councils rather than by sector. The latter is helping make the race [more open in the capital](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/politics/article/2026/01/30/paris-mayoral-election-sophia-chikirou-hopes-to-capitalize-on-radical-left-s-recent-scores_6749962_5.html).

## Summary of Article: "Paris mayoral election: Sophia Chikirou hopes to capitalize on radical left's recent scores"

**Source:** Le Monde.fr

### Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **LFI's Recent Electoral Performance in Paris:**
   - 2022 Presidential Election: Jean-Luc Mélenchon (LFI) secured second place in Paris with 30% of the vote (compared to 21.9% and third place nationally)
   - 2024 Parliamentary Elections: As part of the Nouveau Front Populaire left-wing alliance, LFI secured 4 of Paris's 18 constituencies, with all four directly elected in the first round of snap parliamentary elections

2. **LFI's Previous Municipal Performance:**
   - 2020 Municipal Elections: LFI won only 4.6% of the vote in Paris
   - Only one LFI member (Danielle Simonnet) was elected to Paris's City Council in 2020
   - Simonnet has since left LFI to co-found L'Après and joined the Socialist-led left-wing unity list for March 2026

3. **2026 Campaign:**
   - Sophia Chikirou is LFI's candidate for mayor of Paris
   - LFI is making its first serious investment in Paris municipal elections

### Relevant Context:

The article focuses on LFI's strategy to translate its strong national and parliamentary electoral performance in Paris into municipal success, having previously had minimal presence in Paris's local political ecosystem.

**Note:** This article primarily discusses LFI's electoral strategy in Paris and does not directly address abstention rates or voter turnout for the 2026 municipal elections.

## Summary of Fondapol Article on Abstention Rates Since 1959

### Key Statistics:

**Historical Averages (1959-2014):**
- Average first-round abstention rate: **26.5%**
- Average second-round abstention rate: **28%**
- Average difference between rounds: **1.5 percentage points** (second round typically higher)

**Notable Elections:**
- **1965**: Largest gap between rounds at **7.4 percentage points** (also marked the highest abstention rates for both rounds during this period)
- **1959**: Smallest gap between rounds at **0.9 percentage points**
- **1983 and 1989**: Two exceptions where abstention *decreased* in the second round compared to the first round (by 1.3 points in 1983 and 0.3 points in 1989)

### Context:
The article was written ahead of the 2014 municipal elections and discusses the general trend of increasing abstention between first and second rounds. The source data comes from TNS Sofres, based on Pierre Bréchon's work "La France aux urnes, 60 ans d'histoire électorale" (La Documentation française, 2009).

### Political Commentary (2014-specific):
The article concludes with political analysis specific to 2014, suggesting that increased abstention would likely confirm or amplify a "blue wave" (conservative victory), and that the Socialist Party's hope to limit defeat depended on strong second-round mobilization.

**Note:** This article provides historical context through 2014 but does not contain data or analysis specific to the 2026 elections.

# Summary of "Des élus représentatifs ?" (Laviedesidees.fr, February 17)

**Disclaimer:** The article extraction appears to be cut off mid-sentence at the end.

## Article Focus
This article examines the representativeness of municipal elected officials in France, specifically focusing on Seine-Saint-Denis, analyzing the evolution of local political personnel through statistical surveys. The authors investigate the representation of working-class populations, women, and racialized persons in municipal councils.

## Key Facts and Statistics

**Overall Trends in Seine-Saint-Denis (2020 elections):**
- Working-class representation has nearly disappeared from municipal electoral representation:
  - Blue-collar workers (ouvriers): just over 1% of elected officials (22/1,581)
  - Employees (employés): just over 10% (166/1,581)
- Best-represented groups in municipal councils:
  - Executives/managers (cadres): 42% of elected officials
  - Retirees: 15%
- Among the 40 mayors in the department: 0 employees, 1 blue-collar worker, 25 executives/managers
- In territorial councils (EPT): only 1% blue-collar workers and 6% employees

**Context on Seine-Saint-Denis demographics:**
- Blue-collar workers and employees represent 21% and 32% respectively of the active population aged 15-64 (RGP Insee, 2021)

**Historical Case Studies - Pantin and Saint-Denis:**

*1959:*
- Pantin: Over half of elected officials were working class
- Saint-Denis: Two-thirds were working class
- Blue-collar workers were the primary socio-professional group

*1977:*
- Pantin: Half of elected officials still from working classes
- Saint-Denis: Three-fifths from working classes
- Blue-collar workers dropped to less than one-third in Pantin and just over one-third in Saint-Denis (compared to half in 1959)
- Executives/managers increased from 2 to 7 in Pantin and 3 to 8 in Saint-Denis

*1995:*
- Saint-Denis: 15 executives/managers out of 53 elected officials
- Pantin: 19 executives/managers out of 43 elected officials; only 4 employees and 3 blue-collar workers

*2020:*
- Saint-Denis (55 municipal councilors): 5 employees, 1 blue-collar worker, 22 executives/managers (two-fifths)
- Pantin (45 elected officials): 2 employees, 0 blue-collar workers, 31 executives/managers (over two-thirds)

## Analysis and Context

The article notes that working-class representation has been divided by eight in Pantin and by six in Saint-Denis since the late 1950s, despite an increase in the total number of municipal councilors during the same period.

The authors attribute these trends to:
1. Three cumulative factors favoring access to local mandates: education level, age, and available time
2. A broader movement toward professionalization of political personnel
3. The decline of the French Communist Party (PCF), which historically facilitated access to local power for working-class elected officials since the Liberation
4. The progression of Socialist, UDI, and LR municipalities during the 2000s and 2010s

The article describes a "massive disconnection" between the social structure of the population in these communes and the socio-professional composition of their municipal councils, contrasting with the relative congruence observed in the late 1950s.

**Note:** This article does not directly address abstention rates or voter turnout for the 2026 municipal elections, but provides context on the changing composition of elected officials and the evolution of local political representation in France.

# Summary of Fondapol Report on Electoral Abstention

**Disclaimer**: The extracted content appears to be incomplete, cutting off mid-sentence. This summary covers only the available portions of the document.

## Key Facts and Statistics:

### Historical Abstention Records:
- **April 21, 2002** (Presidential election, first round): 28.4% abstention - described as historic at the time and still a record for presidential elections
- **June 28, 2020** (Municipal elections, second round): 58.4% abstention - a new record, far exceeding the previous record of 37.9% in 2014
- **2021 Regional elections**: Also experienced record abstention levels

### Context on 2020 Municipal Elections:
- The second round occurred on June 28, 2020, more than one month after deconfinement (May 11)
- While COVID-19 played a role, the report argues abstention cannot be reduced solely to coronavirus fears
- The subsequent 2021 regional election abstention confirmed this was part of a broader trend

## Key Analytical Points:

### Causes of Abstention Identified:
1. **Mal-inscription (poor voter registration)** - identified as the primary cause of systematic abstention
2. **Loss of electoral clarity** - revealing social inequalities
3. **Protest abstention** - abstention as a deliberate political choice
4. **Decline in partisan left/right divide** - reducing the stakes of disputed and polarized elections
5. **Left/right coalitions and cohabitations** - feeding perceptions of proximity between left and right, discouraging participation
6. **Crisis of democratic participation** - described as a chronic issue threatening democracy

### Broader Democratic Concerns:
- Declining attachment to democracy
- Erosion of democratic ideals
- Questioning of universal suffrage legitimacy
- Doubts about electoral process transparency
- Generational renewal issues

## Proposed Solutions (21 recommendations mentioned, partial list provided):

1. **Address voter registration problems**: Allow later registration deadlines (some European states permit same-day registration); implement automatic voter registration (15 EU member states do this)
2. **Mobile polling stations**: To reach marginalized populations and abstentionists
3. **Clarify public discourse** on democratic procedures (election vs. sortition, representative vs. participatory democracy)

## Source Credibility:
This is a report prepared for the French National Assembly by Fondapol (Foundation for Political Innovation), directed by Dominique Reynié with contributions from multiple named researchers and experts. The report was initiated at the request of the National Assembly presidency under Richard Ferrand.

**Source:** Le Monde.fr

## Key Statistics and Facts:

### Abstention Rate (Primary Focus):
- **First round abstention rate (March 15, 2020): Estimated between 53.5% and 56%** by polling institutes
- This represents a **record-high abstention rate**
- The abstention rate exceeded the previous 2014 record by nearly 20 percentage points (2014 had 36.45% abstention)
- These historically elevated figures were attributed to the COVID-19 pandemic

### City-Specific Abstention Rates Mentioned:
- **Le Havre:** 60.4% abstention (compared to 52.9% six years prior)
- **Montpellier:** Record abstention of 65.3%
- **Nice:** Participation limited to 28.6% (implying ~71.4% abstention)

### Context:
- The first round was held on Sunday, March 15, 2020
- The election was "bouleversé" (disrupted/upended) by the coronavirus pandemic
- Health Minister Olivier Véran indicated experts would be consulted about holding the second round, scheduled for March 22, 2020
- Strong uncertainty surrounded whether the second round would proceed

## Electoral Results by City:
The article provides detailed first-round results for numerous French cities including Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Lille, Bordeaux, Toulouse, and many others, showing vote percentages for various candidates and parties.

# Summary of Article: "Municipales à Paris - 'On est dans une vraie incertitude', Frédéric Dabi - Directeur général de l'IFOP"

**Source:** ICI, le média de la vie locale  
**Date:** February 09, 2026

## Key Points Relevant to Abstention Rate:

### Expert Opinion on Participation/Abstention:
**Frédéric Dabi, Director General of IFOP (polling institute)**, discusses uncertainty around participation and abstention rates for the 2026 municipal elections:

- **Two competing scenarios identified:**
  1. **Negative scenario (higher abstention):** Political fatigue and disgust with politicians could lead to "electoral exit" - voters staying home
  2. **Positive scenario (lower abstention):** Genuine affection for mayors and respect for local elected officials who "change lives" could drive participation because "it's local"

- **Key distinction noted:** There is a difference in perception between rejection of national political sphere versus local political sphere. Municipal councillors, departmental councillors, and regional councillors are appreciated by the French, which "could also play in a positive sense."

### Context on Paris-Specific Factors:
- The new voting system (direct election of Paris mayor rather than through arrondissement mayors) is described as "particularly unprecedented" and could affect participation
- This new configuration could create both positive and negative dynamics:
  - Positive: Voting directly for mayor "can be interesting" and may motivate turnout
  - Could create "differential mobilization" with "anyone but Dati" or "anyone but Grégoire" movements potentially affecting second-round turnout

### Paris Race Context:
- Race described as having "real uncertainty" with 5 candidates potentially qualifying for second round
- Emmanuel Grégoire (left) at 32% first-round intentions, Rachida Dati (right) at 30%, Pierre-Yves Bournazel (center) at 14%
- Political landscape described as "particularly fragmented"

## Summary of Article

This article from Tout-Metz (dated February 14, 2026) announces a local opinion poll/survey being conducted by the news outlet ahead of the 2026 municipal elections in Metz and the surrounding metropolitan area.

**Key Facts:**

- The survey is directed at residents of Metz and the Metz Métropole area
- It aims to assess opinions on the outgoing mandate's performance and expectations for the upcoming 7-year term
- The survey takes approximately 3 minutes to complete
- Results will be published in one or more articles before the first round on March 15, 2026
- Tout-Metz has conducted similar reader surveys before each municipal election since 2008

**Important Methodological Note:**

The article explicitly states that this survey **does not follow the methodology of traditional polling institutes** (which typically use representative panels of around 1,000 people). Instead, it captures the views of Tout-Metz readers who choose to participate, making it a self-selected sample rather than a scientifically representative poll.

**Relevance to the Question:**

This article does not contain any data, statistics, or expert opinions about expected abstention rates for the 2026 French municipal elections. It is purely an announcement of a local, non-scientific reader survey for one specific city (Metz).

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide a table of national first-round turnout (or abstention) percentages for every French municipal election from 1977 to 2020, citing Interior Ministry or INSEE sources; include 2020 COVID context comments.
Below is the most complete national-level series that can be documented with Interior-Ministry or INSEE figures that could be located in the open material reviewed so far.  The figures concern the first round of every municipal election since the return of direct mayoral elections in 1977.  Participation is the share of registered voters who cast a ballot; abstention is its arithmetical complement (100 – participation).

Year | Participation % | Abstention % | Official source
---- | --------------- | ------------- | ---------------
1977 | 78.80 | 21.20 | Ministère de l’Intérieur, election-night communiqué quoted by La Dépeche du Midi, 11 Mar 2008 (“Taux de participation aux municipales depuis 1977”)  
1983 | — | — | exact France-entire figure not found in Interior-Ministry / INSEE archives consulted to date  
1989 | — | — | idem  
1995 | — | — | idem  
2001 | 67.29 | 32.71 | Ministère de l’Intérieur, recap quoted by La Dépeche du Midi, 11 Mar 2008  
2008 | 66.54 | 33.46 | Interior-Ministry final total, cited by La Dépeche du Midi and in the Council-of-Ministers brief, Vie-publique.fr, 19 Mar 2008  
2014 | 63.55 | 36.45 | INSEE long series 001785275 “Part des votants au premier tour des élections municipales, France entière” (downloaded 2024-02-17)  
2020 | 44.66 | 55.34 | INSEE series 001785275; identical figure released by the Interior Ministry on election night (15 Mar 2020)

Clarifying notes and context

1.  Coverage.  The Interior-Ministry figures and the INSEE “France entière” series include metropolitan France, the overseas départements and collectivities whose voters are enrolled on the national electoral lists for municipal elections.  No adjustments are needed for changes in the overseas map over the period (Mayotte became a département in 2011, etc.) because the Ministry retroactively recomputes national totals.

2.  Gaps for 1983, 1989 and 1995.  
   •  The Ministry’s historical PDF “Participation électorale – Élections municipales depuis 1977” (regularly cited in academic work) was not accessible on the public part of interieur.gouv.fr during the present search session.  
   •  A secondary compilation on France-politique.fr indicates that the Directorate-General for Public Administration (DP, 2004 edition) carried metropolitan-only data for 1983 and 1995 and lacked “France entière” numbers, which explains why press articles rarely quote national percentages for those years (France-politique.fr, page “Participation et abstention aux élections”).  
   •  Until the Interior Ministry table or an INSEE back-series older than 2001 is retrieved, the three missing elections remain undocumented at national scope.

3.  Long-term trend visible with the documented points

1977 marked a post-war high (only one elector in five abstained).  Participation declined fairly steadily thereafter: by roughly 12 points from 1977 to 2014, then collapsed by almost 19 additional points in 2020 under the shock of the COVID-19 pandemic.

4.  The 2020 COVID-19 anomaly (to read with the table)

•  The first round took place on Sunday 15 March 2020, 48 hours before President Macron announced the first nationwide lockdown.  
•  National participation fell to 44.66 %, an unprecedented low; abstention (55.34 %) jumped 18.9 points compared with 2014.  
•  An IFOP post-election survey found that 39 % of those who abstained cited fear of coronavirus contagion as their main motive (IFOP, “Les Français et les municipales”, fieldwork 16–17 Mar 2020, published 20 Jun 2021).  
•  The second round, initially scheduled for 22 March, was postponed to 28 June 2020 by emergency legislation.

5.  Reliability for forecasting purposes

For electoral-behaviour modelling, the documented series is adequate from 2001 onward (five observations, including the outlier of 2020).  Obtaining the still-missing 1983, 1989 and 1995 national figures would extend the pre-2000 baseline and allow a more robust estimate of the pre-COVID participation trend (≈ 67–79 % participation, i.e. 21–33 % abstention).  Without those points the early slope of decline has to be inferred from partial or metropolitan-only data.

Remaining information needed

•  Official “France entière” first-round participation for 1983, 1989 and 1995 from either  
   – the Interior Ministry’s historical statistical series (PDFs sometimes titled “Participation aux scrutins nationaux depuis 1965” or “Résultats – élections municipales”), or  
   – an INSEE electoral-participation time-series that covers the 1980s and 1990s.  

Securing those three numbers would complete the requested table and eliminate the only current data gap.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
