Disagreement Analysis:

The forecasters' central estimates (implied medians) range from ~40% (forecaster_2) to ~45% (forecaster_5), a 5-percentage-point spread. The key disagreements are:

**1. How much the post-2024 political crisis will elevate abstention above the pre-COVID trend (~36-39%)**
- Forecasters 1 and 2 see a modest "political crisis premium" of 1-3 points, centering their estimates around 40-42%.
- Forecasters 3, 4, and 5 see a larger premium of 3-6 points, centering around 43-45%.
- This is the single largest driver of disagreement, accounting for roughly 3-4 points of spread in medians.

**2. Whether the 2021 regional/departmental elections (66%+ abstention) are informative for 2026 municipal elections**
- Forecaster 5 explicitly cites "2021-24 elections show sustained high abstention (>50%)" as evidence that structural disengagement persists, pushing their estimate higher.
- Forecasters 1 and 2 largely dismiss 2021 as a different election type (regional vs. municipal) and note that municipal elections historically have much higher turnout due to local attachment and trust in mayors.
- This affects the upper tail significantly: forecaster_5's P90 is 55% vs. forecaster_1's 46.5%.

**3. Impact of the new uniform proportional list system on turnout**
- Forecasters 4 and 5 assign +0.5 to +1 point for the new proportional list rule depersonalizing races in small communes.
- Forecasters 1 and 2 don't explicitly quantify this effect.
- This is a smaller disagreement (~1 point) but contributes to the overall spread.

Root Causes:

1. **Political crisis impact on municipal abstention**: This is primarily a *different weighting of the same evidence*. All forecasters acknowledge the post-dissolution political malaise, but they disagree on how much national-level disaffection translates to local municipal elections. This could be partially resolved by finding polling data on voter intent for the 2026 municipals specifically.

2. **Relevance of 2021 regional election abstention**: This is a *different factual belief* about whether high abstention in 2021 reflects a structural shift or was itself partly a COVID/timing anomaly. Finding expert analysis comparing 2021 regional abstention causes to municipal election dynamics could help.

3. **Proportional list system impact**: This is a *different factual belief* about a verifiable institutional change. Research on expert predictions about how the new system affects small-commune turnout could resolve this.
