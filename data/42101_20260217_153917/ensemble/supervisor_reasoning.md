Resolution of Disagreements:

**1. How much the post-2024 political crisis will elevate abstention (the main disagreement)**

The targeted research strongly supports the higher-abstention forecasters (3, 4, 5). Bruno Cautrès (CNRS/CEVIPOF), the most prominent French political scientist on this topic, explicitly stated on Public Sénat (Feb 10, 2026) that abstention will likely be "around 50%" and ruled out a return to the pre-COVID 38-42% band. The CEVIPOF "Baromètre de la confiance politique" (January 2026) registers historic lows of trust in politics (22%) and democracy (23%), with the CEVIPOF team explicitly linking this to "a risk of record abstention." This is strong, named-source evidence that directly contradicts forecasters 1 and 2's central estimates of 40-42%.

**2. Whether 2021 regional elections are informative**

The research partially supports forecaster 5's use of 2021 data. Cautrès's framing of "levels of abstention comparable to those observed in local elections since 2017, i.e. roughly one voter out of two" explicitly treats the post-2017 high-abstention pattern as structural rather than COVID-specific. This validates the view that 2021 wasn't purely a COVID anomaly but reflected deeper disengagement.

**3. Impact of the new proportional list system**

The research resolves this as roughly neutral nationally. Cautrès himself noted modest positive effects in big cities but warned the unfamiliar procedure may deter rural voters, with effects "more or less offsetting each other." This is consistent with forecasters 4 and 5's small adjustments but confirms it's not a major factor.

**4. The Destin Commun survey finding**

The Destin Commun study found 60% of French citizens "certain to vote" 4 months before the election, implying ~40% abstention. However, this is a stated-intent measure taken well before the election, and the gap between stated intent and actual turnout is well-documented. Cautrès's expert estimate of ~50% implicitly accounts for this gap.

Updated Analysis:

The research decisively shifts the balance toward the higher-abstention forecasters. The key new evidence is:

1. **Bruno Cautrès's explicit ~50% estimate** - This is the most authoritative named-source prediction available, from France's leading municipal election analyst.
2. **Historic lows in political trust** (22% trust in politics, 23% in democracy) - These are concrete numbers, not speculation.
3. **No turnout polls exist** - The absence of "certain to vote" polling means we cannot anchor to voter intent data, increasing uncertainty.
4. **Expert consensus clusters in 48-52%** - The agent report's synthesis places the median analyst expectation in this range.

However, I note some countervailing factors:
- Municipal elections historically benefit from higher trust in mayors vs. national politicians
- The Destin Commun survey's 60% "certain to vote" figure, while likely overstating actual turnout, suggests some baseline engagement
- Cautrès's estimate could be somewhat pessimistic; he's one expert

My updated central estimate is ~47-48%, reflecting:
- Strong expert evidence pointing to ~50% but with some discount for municipal elections' historically stronger mobilization
- The 88% who say their local quality of life hasn't degraded (Destin Commun) could moderate the national-level distrust effect
- Wide uncertainty given no turnout polls and unprecedented political climate

The weighted average's implied median of roughly 43-44% appears too low given the expert evidence. I'm shifting upward by approximately 3-4 points at the center, with appropriately wide tails.

Confidence: MEDIUM

The research provides strong directional evidence (named expert, trust barometer data) but Cautrès is ultimately one expert, and the gap between his ~50% estimate and the pre-COVID baseline (~36-39%) is large enough that some skepticism is warranted. Municipal elections have unique local dynamics that could partially counteract national distrust.
