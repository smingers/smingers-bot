## Notable Quotes:

**Louis Aliot (winner):** "This is work that has lasted a long time... By making ourselves known, presenting ourselves as we are, the people of Perpignan have chosen. I didn't expect such a clear victory but it proves that people supported my project and people who no longer wanted to see this system in place... The surge in participation was for us."

**Jean-Marc Pujol (defeated incumbent):** "We started from far away and we didn't get too far. But it's the law of democracy that I respect."

## Context:
- The election occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic
- A "republican front" (left-wing parties and LREM withdrawing to support the center-right incumbent against the far-right candidate) was formed but proved insufficient
- Perpignan had been center-right for 60 years prior to this election

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Paris Municipal Election Polling (IFOP-Fiducial for LCI, Le Parisien and Sud Radio):**
- Emmanuel Grégoire: 32% first-round voting intentions
- Rachida Dati: 30% first-round voting intentions
- Pierre-Yves Bournazel: 14%
- Five candidates could potentially qualify for the second round (a "quinquagulaire")
- Multiple candidates reaching around 10% of expressed votes
- Sofia Chikirou (France Insoumise) could exceed 10%
- Sarah Knafo could exceed 10%

## Expert Opinion (Named Source):

**Frédéric Dabi, Director General of IFOP polling institute:**

On the race's uncertainty:
- Describes the situation as "a real uncertainty" - completely different from February 2020 when it seemed clear Anne Hidalgo would win
- Notes the political landscape is "particularly fragmented" and far from the old left-right bipolarization
- Each leading candidate has strong assets but also faces threats from other candidates

On participation/abstention:
- Identifies two possible scenarios regarding turnout:
  1. **Negative scenario:** Disgust with politicians who particularly disappoint could lead to "electoral exit"
  2. **Positive scenario:** Real affection for mayors and respect for local elected officials who "change lives" could drive participation because "it's local"
- Notes a difference in perception between rejection of national political sphere versus local political sphere
- States that municipal councillors, departmental councillors, and regional councillors are appreciated by the French, which "could also play in a positive sense"

On the new voting system:
- The new configuration allowing Parisians to vote directly for the Paris mayor (rather than through arrondissement mayors) is "particularly unprecedented"
- This could create both positive and negative dynamics
- Could mobilize voters wanting to remove the left even if they live in a right-wing arrondissement
- Conversely, an "anyone but Dati" or "anyone but Grégoire" phenomenon could create differential mobilization in the second round

# Summary of "Elections municipales 2026 : mobilisation et attentes des Français"

**Source:** Destincommun.fr (think tank Destin Commun study)

**Study methodology:** Survey of 3,013 people and four focus groups

## Key Statistics on Voter Mobilization:

- **6 out of 10 French citizens (60%)** are already certain they will vote in the municipal elections (4 months before the election)
- This implies a potential **40% abstention rate** if these intentions hold

### Mobilization by Political Affiliation:
- Renaissance supporters: 84% certain to vote
- Les Républicains supporters: 77% certain to vote
- La France Insoumise (LFI) and Ecologistes: experiencing "under-mobilization" compared to other parties (specific percentages not provided)

### Mobilization by Age:
- **18-26 year olds (Generation Z): only 34% certain to vote**
- **75+ year olds: 88% certain to vote**
- Older and wealthier French citizens are most certain to participate

### Mobilization Pattern:
The study identifies a "vicious circle of disengagement": French citizens who know their municipal team the least are those who feel they benefit least from its actions, and who also have the least intention to vote in March 2026.

## Context on National vs. Local Sentiment:

- 88% of French consider the country is going in the wrong direction (constantly increasing since 2019)
- However, only 27% consider their quality of life has degraded in their commune during the last municipal mandate
- The study highlights a "profound dissonance" between negative national projections and more positive individual local experiences

## Top Local Priorities:

1. Security (45%)
2. Local taxes (29%)
3. Access to public services (24%)

**Note:** This is a pre-election poll/study conducted approximately 4 months before the March 2026 elections, measuring voting intentions rather than actual turnout.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: What do French political analysts and polling institutes predict for the abstention rate in the first round of the 2026 French municipal elections? Are there any recent polls measuring voter intent to participate, and what effect do experts expect from the new uniform proportional list system applying to all communes?
1. What analysts publicly forecast for the 2026 first-round abstention rate  

•  Bruno Cautrès (CNRS/CEVIPOF), the political scientist most often interviewed on the subject, told the programme “Sens Public” on Public Sénat on 10 February 2026 that “everything suggests we will stay at levels of abstention comparable to those observed in local elections since 2017, i.e. roughly one voter out of two”. He ruled out a return to the pre-Covid band of 38-42 % and situated the most plausible national abstention “around 50 %” unless an exceptional mobilisation surge occurs (Public Sénat, 10 Feb 2026).  

•  The 17th wave of the CEVIPOF “Baromètre de la confiance politique” (fieldwork January 2026, Opinion Way) registers historic lows of trust in politics (22 %) and in the functioning of democracy (23 %). In its presentation (Le Monde, 9 Feb 2026) the CEVIPOF team explicitly links this climate to “a risk of record abstention” at the March municipal elections. Although no numeric figure is given, the wording implies the institute deems a repetition of – or even an excess over – the 55.3 % abstention recorded in March 2020 conceivable.  

•  No other named analyst or institution has yet attached a precise percentage to its diagnosis, but the mainstream commentary collected in Le Monde, Le Figaro and on LCI since January converges on three qualitative points:  
  – the Covid-specific peak of 55.3 % in 2020 should recede,  
  – structural distrust makes a fall back to the 2014 level (36.5 %) improbable,  
  – the central forecast band therefore lies somewhere between the two, most often verbalised as “around one in two voters”.  

2. What polling institutes have measured so far  

•  As of mid-February 2026 no institute has released a national survey including the classic “certain to vote” indicator for the municipal first round. The rolling city polls from Ifop-Fiducial, Ipsos, Elabe and Cluster 17 deal exclusively with partisan vote intention in the largest conurbations and omit any turnout battery (previous review; latest Ifop Paris poll 21 Jan 2026 confirms the omission).  

•  The only broad survey published in 2026, Ifop for La Tribune Dimanche “How the French feel about the 2026 municipal elections” (5 Feb 2026), maps satisfaction with local life but similarly contains no question on participation intentions (Ifop, 5 Feb 2026).  

•  Earlier, the AMF-CEVIPOF/Ipsos “Observatoire de la démocratie de proximité” (fieldwork 16-23 June 2025, 6 034 respondents) gauges attachment to the commune and potential local engagement but does not quantify likelihood of voting in March 2026 (AMF-CEVIPOF, 2 Jul 2025).  

Result: there is, to date, no published, sample-based percentage of French electors who say they are “certain” to vote on 15 March 2026. The only quasi-quantitative guidance remains Bruno Cautrès’s verbal 50 % abstention estimate.

3. Expected impact of the new uniform proportional-list rule  

The 2022 electoral law generalises the proportional list system (with gender alternation) to all communes, replacing the plurality-at-large vote still used in villages under 1 000 inhabitants, and abolishes the sector-based vote in Paris, Lyon and Marseille. Expert expectations extracted from the press and parliamentary hearings are the following:  

•  Big-city mobilisation.  Because Paris, Lyon and Marseille will now elect a single council instead of separate sector councils, races are regarded as “much more open” and therefore potentially more mobilising for voters whose ballots were previously diluted at sector level (Le Monde, 30 Jan 2026 – article referenced in the briefing). Cautrès echoes this, foreseeing a modest positive turnout effect in those metropolitan areas (Public Sénat, 10 Feb 2026).  

•  Small-commune learning curve.  Extending party-labelled lists to villages removes the personalised “panachage” vote many rural electors value. In the same Sens Public debate, Cautrès warns that the unfamiliar procedure may deter some habitual rural voters in 2026, at least temporarily, cancelling out big-city gains.  

•  Institutional view.  During a Senate mission on intercommunality (hearing of 1 July 2025) Minister François Rebsamen stated that the reform aims chiefly at representation and gender parity and acknowledged that its short-term electoral impact is uncertain (Senate, Compte rendu 1 Jul 2025). No quantitative modelling of the overall effect on turnout has been produced.  

Consensus: specialists expect differentiated, probably small effects (slight boost in the three largest cities, slight depressive effect in the smallest communes) that could more or less offset each other at the national level. No one anticipates the rule change to transform the global abstention curve.

4. Synthesis with regard to the forecasting target  

•  Benchmark figures: 36.5 % abstention in 2014; 55.3 % in the Covid-affected 2020 first round.  

•  Current expert signals:  
  – floor judged around 48 % (one in two voting) by Bruno Cautrès;  
  – CEVIPOF barometer’s language of “risk of record abstention” keeps an upper-tail scenario (≈ 55 % or slightly above) alive;  
  – absence of turnout polls prevents narrowing the plausible band.  

•  Reform effects thought to be roughly neutral nationally.  

Given the available evidence the median analyst expectation today clusters in the 48-52 % abstention interval, with a non-negligible tail extending toward the 2020 record should distrust translate into extra demobilisation.

5. Information still missing and why it matters  

•  A nationally representative poll measuring “certitude de vote” for the municipal election (e.g., ≥ 5 000 sample size, 0–10 scale) is still lacking. Such a number would allow forecasters to anchor models instead of relying on expert intuition.  

•  Any public note from the big institutes (Ifop, Ipsos, Opinion Way, Elabe, BVA) that translates their qualitative analyses into a numeric turnout projection.  

•  Empirical assessment—through pilot surveys or ex-post simulations—of the turnout impact of the new proportional-list system by commune size.  

Without these three pieces of data, forecasts remain limited to the broad “around 50 %” range and cannot discriminate finely between, say, 47 % and 53 % abstention.  

In sum, as of mid-February 2026 French analysts publicly envisage a first-round abstention located in the high-40s to low-50s, with some warning signs that it could creep back toward the 2020 record. No published poll yet quantifies voter intent to participate, and experts expect the new uniform proportional list system to exert only marginal, offsetting effects on turnout at the national scale.</Agent_report>

  - 2001: 65% of communes
  - 2014: 82% of communes  
  - 2020: 86% of communes
- This increase is primarily driven by communes under 3,500 inhabitants, showing a structural change between (2001, 2008) and (2014, 2020)

### Competition Levels by Commune Size:
- For communes over 3,500 inhabitants, first-round resolution rates **decrease with population size**:

  - Over 100,000 inhabitants: 12% resolved in first round (2020)

- **Average number of candidate lists** in first round (for list-based voting system):
  - 2001: 6.3 lists for communes over 100,000 inhabitants
  - 2020: 9.2 lists for communes over 100,000 inhabitants
  - Nearly 3 additional lists on average for largest communes between 2001-2020

### Second Round Dynamics (communes over 3,500 inhabitants):
- Structure of second rounds has changed significantly:
  - 2001: ~50% were two-way races
  - 2020: 30% two-way races, 55% three-way races, 15% four-way or more races

## Article Summary

**Source:** vie-publique.fr  
**Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Topic:** Electoral system for municipal elections in communes with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants

### Key Facts:

1. **Major Electoral Reform**: Since the law of May 21, 2025, the electoral system for municipal councilors in communes with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants is now identical to that of communes with 1,000 or more inhabitants.

2. **New Voting System**: The system is now a proportional list system with two rounds, featuring a 50% bonus for the winning list.

3. **Parity Requirements**: Lists must respect gender parity (equal numbers of women and men with mandatory alternation). Voters cannot cross out names or change the order on ballots (no "panachage").

4. **First Round Rules**: 
   - The list obtaining an absolute majority of votes cast receives half of the seats (majority bonus)
   - Remaining seats are distributed proportionally among all lists obtaining more than 5% of votes cast

5. **Second Round Thresholds**:
   - Only lists with at least 10% of votes in the first round can continue
   - Lists with at least 5% can merge with lists that obtained more than 10%

6. **Adjustments for Small Communes**: The 2025 law includes accommodations for communes under 1,000 inhabitants to account for difficulties in composing gender-parity lists in small towns.

7. **Ballot Validity Changes**: A decree from August 6, 2025, specifies that ballots with modified candidate order or handwritten mentions are now considered null. However, in communes under 1,000 inhabitants, circulars used as ballots and handwritten ballots are authorized.

8. **Overseas Territories**: An ordinance from November 19, 2025, adapts the May 21, 2025 law to French Polynesia and New Caledonia, with the reform taking effect in 2032 in these territories.

**Relevance to the forecasting question:** This article confirms one of the procedural changes mentioned in the background information—the extension of the uniform proportional list system to all communes, including those with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants. This represents a significant structural change to the 2026 municipal elections.

**Date:** February 10, 2026  
**Author:** Rédaction Toute l'Europe

## Key Facts Relevant to the Question:

### Electoral System Changes (May 2025 Reform)
- A law passed on May 21, 2025 standardized the electoral system for all French communes, regardless of size
- The proportional list system with majority bonus now applies uniformly to all communes (previously only those with >1,000 inhabitants)
- Elections now occur on the same dates in all communes, in metropolitan France and overseas territories

### Specific Changes for Small Communes (<1,000 inhabitants)
- Voters can no longer add/remove names or modify candidate order on lists during voting
- Lists must respect gender parity with mandatory alternation between women and men
- According to the Interior Ministry, these changes are intended to promote "parity and cohesion in municipal councils"
- Some accommodations exist: lists are considered complete even with up to two fewer candidates than seats available
- Municipal councils are considered complete with minimum thresholds: at least 5 elected officials for communes <100 inhabitants, 9 for 100-499 inhabitants, and 13 for 500-999 inhabitants

### Electoral System Details
- Two-round system held every six years
- First round: A list wins outright if it obtains absolute majority (>50% of votes cast)
- Second round (one week later): Only lists with ≥10% can continue; lists with ≥5% can merge with others
- Seat distribution: Winning list receives half the seats automatically (majority bonus); remaining half distributed proportionally among all lists with >5% of votes

### European Context
The article primarily discusses comparative electoral systems across Europe but does not provide specific data on French abstention rates or predictions for 2026 participation.

**Note:** The article appears to be cut off mid-sentence and does not contain information directly addressing abstention rates or turnout predictions for the 2026 French municipal elections.
