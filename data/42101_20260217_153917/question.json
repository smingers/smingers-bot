    "description": "French municipal elections are held every six years to elect municipal councillors, who then elect mayors. Elections are scheduled for March 15, 2026 (first round), and March 22, 2026 (second round), as established by [D\u00e9cret n\u00b0 2025-848 of August 27, 2025](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/).\n\nThe 2020 election was anomalous: held during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the first round (March 15, 2020) saw a record-low participation under 45%. Approximately 39% of abstentionists cited coronavirus fears as their primary reason for not voting.\n\nA key question in French politics right now is whether 2026 will revert toward the pre-COVID trend (\\~38-42%) or whether structural factors (political disaffection, weakened local attachments) and the overall terrible political climate in the country since the 2024 dissolution will maintain higher abstention levels.\n\nTwo procedural changes have been implemented this time around. New uniform proportional list system now applies to all communes (previously only those >1,000 inhabitants) and Paris, Lyon, and Marseille now elect city-wide councils rather than by sector. The latter is helping make the race [more open in the capital](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/politics/article/2026/01/30/paris-mayoral-election-sophia-chikirou-hopes-to-capitalize-on-radical-left-s-recent-scores_6749962_5.html).\n\n[Historically](https://www.fondapol.org/decryptage/les-chiffres-de-labstention-depuis-1959/):\n\n![](https://cdn.metaculus.com/user_uploaded/mt1-e1396027474976.jpg)\n\nThe participation rate (i.e., the inverse of the abstention rate) for 2014 and 2020 can be found [here.](https://www.insee.fr/fr/statistiques/serie/001785275)\n\n`{\"format\":\"metac_reveal_and_close_in_period\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":42035,\"question_id\":41783}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve as the national abstention rate for the first round of the 2026 French municipal elections, according to the French Interior Ministry.\n\nThe resolution value will be expressed as a percentage of registered voters.",
    "fine_print": "The question will resolve based on the final national figure, not midday/17:00 estimates, and will concern the whole country, all territories and departments included.\n\nAfter the election takes place, results are expected to be posted on the Ministry's [official election results page](https://www.archives-resultats-elections.interieur.gouv.fr/resultats/municipales-2026/index.php). If the Ministry does not publish results for a week after the election, the question may resolve based on preliminary estimates or other credible sources.\n\nIf the election date is officially postponed, the question will resolve based on the first round when it actually occurs, if it occurs before April 20, 2026. If the first round of the election is postponed to April 20, 2026 or beyond, this question will be **annulled**.\n\n***\nThis question's information (resolution criteria, fine print, background info, etc) is synced with an [original identical question](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/42035) which opened on 2026-02-11 17:00:00. This question will resolve based on the resolution criteria and fine print contained above. However, if this question would resolve differently than the original question, then this question will be annulled. Additionally, if the original question's resolution could have been known before this question opened, then this question will be annulled.",
