Analysis:
To refine a forecast on the 2026 municipal-election abstention rate we need: 
• Any nationwide polls of voting intention/turnout published since late-2025.  
• Interior-ministry communications or think-tank papers discussing likely participation given the new electoral rules.  
• Commentary comparing current mobilization to 2014 and 2020 and assessing whether the COVID-related spike in abstention will persist.  
• Local-election by-products (e.g., 2025 departmental by-elections) that pundits use as turnout barometers.  
• Articles about campaign dynamics in Paris, Lyon, Marseille, and medium-size towns, because competitive races can lift turnout.  

Therefore searches should combine the French keywords “abstention,” “municipales 2026,” “premier tour,” “participation,” “sondage,” “intention de vote,” and filter for very recent material (Jan–Feb 2026).  AskNews can be used to request a concise roundup of polls and expert analyses published in that time-frame.
