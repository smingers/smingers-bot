You are currently doing research for historical information on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
What will be the abstention rate in the first round of the 2026 French municipal elections?

Question background:
French municipal elections are held every six years to elect municipal councillors, who then elect mayors. Elections are scheduled for March 15, 2026 (first round), and March 22, 2026 (second round), as established by [Décret n° 2025-848 of August 27, 2025](https://www.legifrance.gouv.fr/).

The 2020 election was anomalous: held during the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, the first round (March 15, 2020) saw a record-low participation under 45%. Approximately 39% of abstentionists cited coronavirus fears as their primary reason for not voting.

A key question in French politics right now is whether 2026 will revert toward the pre-COVID trend (\~38-42%) or whether structural factors (political disaffection, weakened local attachments) and the overall terrible political climate in the country since the 2024 dissolution will maintain higher abstention levels.

Two procedural changes have been implemented this time around. New uniform proportional list system now applies to all communes (previously only those >1,000 inhabitants) and Paris, Lyon, and Marseille now elect city-wide councils rather than by sector. The latter is helping make the race [more open in the capital](https://www.lemonde.fr/en/politics/article/2026/01/30/paris-mayoral-election-sophia-chikirou-hopes-to-capitalize-on-radical-left-s-recent-scores_6749962_5.html).

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve as the national abstention rate for the first round of the 2026 French municipal elections, according to the French Interior Ministry.

The resolution value will be expressed as a percentage of registered voters.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-17. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-17 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

The lower bound is 25 and the upper bound is 55.
Both bounds are OPEN: outcomes can fall below the lower bound or above the upper bound. Your percentile estimates may extend beyond this range if well-supported by evidence.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic or financial data, add a FRED query. Use a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate") or a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE"). Returns historical data with computed statistics.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one Agent query.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant historical context needed to generate an outside view.}

Search queries:
1. your query here (Google)
2. your query here (Google News)
3. your query here (Agent)
4. economic indicator query (FRED) -- only if question involves economic/financial data
