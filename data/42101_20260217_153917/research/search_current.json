With less than a month before the first round on March 15, 2026, multiple polls have been released, providing a snapshot of voter intentions. According to the latest Ifop survey published by Midi Libre on February 17, 2026, Vincent Bouget leads with 30% of the vote, followed by Franck Proust (24%), Julien Sanchez (21%), Julien Plantier (14%), Pascal Dupretz (9%), and Jean-Marc Philibert (2%). This marks the first time Bouget, a left-wing candidate, is ahead of the RN candidate in a poll. The survey also shows Proust potentially overtaking Sanchez, a shift confirmed by an earlier OpinionWay poll from February 12, 2026. In the projected second round, Bouget is favored with 44% of the vote, ahead of Proust (29%) and the RN (27%), according to Objectif Gard\u2019s February 12 poll. A similar outcome emerged from Midi Libre\u2019s quadrangular test, showing Bouget at 37%, Sanchez at 25%, Proust at 23%, and Plantier at 15%, with Proust losing support to Sanchez between rounds. However, the article emphasizes that these results reflect only a snapshot in time and are not predictive of the final outcome, with a new poll expected soon that could shift the dynamics.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 08:10 AM\nSource:[actu.fr](https://actu.fr/occitanie/nimes_30189/sondage-municipales-2026-a-nimes-voici-qui-est-place-en-tete_63779133.html)\n\n**Municipales 2026 \u00e0 N\u00eemes : Les Candidats R\u00e9agissent au Sondage Ifop/Midi Libre**\nA recent Ifop/Midi Libre survey for the 2026 N\u00eemes municipal elections shows Vincent Bouget leading with 30% of the vote, followed by candidate Plantier with 24%, Sanchez with 21%, and candidate with 14% in fourth place. The fifth candidate, with 9%, notes a slight increase from previous polling and expresses cautious optimism, emphasizing the need for broader unity. The sixth candidate, at 2%, criticizes the partisan nature of voter behavior and focuses on mobilizing abstainers, particularly given the record abstention during the pandemic. The fourth-place candidate stresses the stability of their support and highlights that their full program will be unveiled soon, aiming to appeal through concrete solutions and unity. The second-place candidate warns against a potential communist resurgence and calls for a united front against them, referencing historical polling trends. The third-place candidate strongly disputes the survey's accuracy, claiming strong grassroots rejection of Jean-Paul Fournier's successors and asserting that the momentum is clearly with their campaign, with the next mayor expected to be either Bouget or Sanchez. All candidates agree that the campaign is just beginning and emphasize mobilization in the final four weeks before the first round on March 15 and 22.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 05:33 AM\nSource:[midilibre.fr](https://www.midilibre.fr/2026/02/17/municipales-2026-a-nimes-les-reactions-de-lensemble-des-candidats-au-sondage-ifop-midi-libre-13228588.php)\n\n**Municipales 2026 \u00e0 N\u00eemes : Survey Reveals Fragmented Field and Uncertain Outcome**\nA survey conducted by midilibre.fr on the 2026 N\u00eemes municipal elections indicates a highly uncertain political landscape ahead of the first round on March 22, 2026. The results suggest a likely quadrangular or quintangular contest, with no clear frontrunner. The right-wing vote is significantly fragmented: the combined score of Julien Plantier and Franck Proust reaches 38%, surpassing Jean-Paul Fournier\u2019s 2020 first-round result. However, Proust trails Fournier by 10.4 points, indicating a loss of historical electoral base. The left-wing coalition\u2014comprising the PC, Europe \u00c9cologie Les Verts, and PS\u2014achieves 27.28%, showing progress since 2020. Vincent Bouget leads among women (38%) and voters under 35 (39%), while Julien Sanchez performs strongly, exceeding the RN\u2019s 2020 score (14.2%). The survey reveals high voter hesitation, especially among Plantier and Proust supporters, with 21% of Fournier\u2019s former voters backing Plantier and 19% supporting Sanchez. Proust is strongest among voters over 50, while Plantier leads among senior executives. Despite a strong left-wing showing, the absence of a united front limits its ability to generate momentum. The final outcome remains highly fluid due to significant demographic and socioeconomic disparities in voting patterns. The article concludes that if the right remains divided, it risks losing, emphasizing that unity is crucial for electoral success.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 05:31 AM\nSource:[midilibre.fr](https://www.midilibre.fr/2026/02/17/exclusif-municipales-2026-a-nimes-qui-est-favori-pour-prendre-la-tete-de-la-mairie-decouvrez-les-resultats-de-notre-sondage-13228965.php)\n\n**Why the 2026 Municipal Mandates Might Last Seven Years Instead of Six**\nThe upcoming French municipal elections in March 2032 may result in mayors serving seven-year terms instead of the standard six-year mandate due to a highly congested electoral calendar. If the current schedule remains unchanged, France will hold six rounds of voting in just four months: municipal elections in March 2032, the presidential election in April\u2013May 2032, and legislative elections in June 2032. To avoid this electoral congestion, Bruno Retailleau, then Minister of the Interior, proposed two options in April 2025: either postpone the municipal elections to autumn 2032 or extend the current mayors\u2019 mandate by one year until 2033. He considered the 'most probable' solution to be a one-year delay of the municipal elections. This extension would require a specific law passed by Parliament after review by the Scientific Council to ensure legitimacy. Historical precedents exist: in 2007, municipal elections were postponed from 2007 to 2008 to avoid conflict with the presidential election, resulting in a seven-year mandate for mayors elected in 2001. Similarly, the Senate mandate was extended by one year to align with the new schedule. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 also led to the postponement of the second round of municipal elections from March to June. More recently, the 2021 regional and departmental elections were extended by several months to avoid overlap with the 2027 presidential election, resulting in a six-year and nine-month term for those elected.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 05:02 AM\nSource:[Le Parisien](https://www.leparisien.fr/elections/municipales/municipales-2026-pourquoi-le-mandat-des-futurs-maires-pourrait-durer-sept-ans-au-lieu-de-six-17-02-2026-K3EF2FXE4NDEHAXMIQUB3VXAV4.php)\n\n**Municipal Elections 2026: Polling Station Opening and Closing Times to Remember**\nThe first round of the 2026 French municipal elections will be held on Sunday, March 15, 2026, with the second round on Sunday, March 22, 2026.

The general closing time is 6:00 PM, but in certain cases\u2014particularly in large cities\u2014closing may be extended to 8:00 PM according to prefectural decrees. The government's official website, Service public, confirms that such extensions are intended to facilitate voter participation in major urban areas. Voters are advised to verify the exact closing time at their local town hall or on their electoral card to avoid missing the deadline. The key dates for the 2026 municipal elections are March 15 (first round) and March 22 (second round).\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 11:31 AM\nSource:[midilibre.fr](https://www.midilibre.fr/2026/02/16/municipales-2026-a-quelle-heure-ouvrent-et-ferment-les-bureaux-de-vote-les-horaires-a-retenir-pour-ne-pas-rater-lelection-13228127.php)\n\n**Municipal 2026: Voters View Victory of a Civil Society Candidate as Positive**\nA Toluna-Harris Interactive survey for RTL, published on February 16, 2026, indicates that municipal elections are of interest to a majority of French voters.

According to the survey, 39% of respondents view the victory of a mayor from civil society\u2014unaffiliated with a political party\u2014as a positive development. The Rassemblement National (RN) is the most trusted political formation, with 34% of voters seeing an RN mayor as a good outcome. This is followed by the Republicans (25%) and the Socialist Party (21%), while 23% of voters view an ecologist mayor favorably. The survey also reveals that 45% of voters consider public and personal safety the most important issue in their voting decision, ahead of health (33%). Jean-Daniel L\u00e9vy, director of Toluna France, notes that voters are particularly attentive to issues affecting their daily lives.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 09:07 AM\nSource:[Orange Actualit\u00e9s](https://actu.orange.fr/politique/municipales-2026-la-victoire-d-un-candidat-issu-de-la-societe-civile-vue-comme-une-bonne-chose-par-de-nombreux-electeurs-magic-CNT000002nnvD5.html)\n\n**Municipales 2026: A Crucial Test for the 2027 Presidential Race**\nThe 2026 French municipal elections, scheduled for the first round on Sunday, February 15, are being viewed as a critical test for the 2027 presidential election. The far-right Rassemblement National (RN), led by Jordan Bardella, aims to confirm its momentum, with plans to field a record number of candidates\u2014over 650 lists\u2014and target key cities like Marseille, where Franck Allisio is closely competing with the left-wing coalition led by Mayor Beno\u00eet Payan, and Toulon, where RN deputy Laure Lavalette appears well-positioned. The RN frames these elections as a stepping stone toward the \u00c9lys\u00e9e, with Bardella calling for 'preparing the alternance' (change of power) in 2027. In contrast, the left, led by PS secretary Olivier Faure, seeks to act as a 'first line of defense' against the far right, aiming to reclaim cities like Saint-\u00c9tienne, Strasbourg, and potentially challenge LR\u2019s stronghold in Paris, where Rachida Dati faces competition from Sarah Knafo of Reconqu\u00eate. The center-right, including Republicans and Horizons, hopes to consolidate alliances\u2014such as in Besan\u00e7on and Bordeaux\u2014and position themselves against the RN, with Bruno Retailleau officially launching his 2027 presidential bid. La France Insoumise, under coordinator Manuel Bompard, sees the elections as a strategic 'warm-up' for the presidential race, focusing on medium-sized cities like Roubaix, where deputy David Guiraud is favored. Ecologists fear significant losses, with Lyon and Strasbourg at risk despite holding Grenoble and Tours. Emmanuel Macron\u2019s party, Renaissance, remains weak at the local level, according to Bruno Jeanbart of OpinionWay. The elections also serve as a litmus test for potential presidential candidates: \u00c9douard Philippe in Le Havre, Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou in Pau, and Fabien Roussel in Saint-Amand-les-Eaux. Voter priorities, according to polls, include security, purchasing power, health, and the environment. However, the 2020 green wave did not translate into presidential success, underscoring that municipal results are not a reliable predictor of national outcomes.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:30 AM\nSource:[Ouest France](https://www.ouest-france.fr/elections/municipales/municipales-2026-j-27-pour-un-scrutin-electoral-test-8dcc4fe0-0a96-11f1-a18b-da0f1e9fda14)\n\n**Abstention in Second Round Reaches 50%**\nThe second round of the Portuguese presidential elections recorded a voter abstention rate of 50%, an increase compared to the first round, according to final provisional data from the Secretaria-Geral do Minist\u00e9rio da Administra\u00e7\u00e3o Interna (SGMAI). A total of 11,039,672 voters were registered for the second round, held predominantly on Sunday, and 5,519,808 cast their votes. The first round, held on January 18, was the most competitive with 11 candidates, and saw a turnout of 52.26% among nearly 11 million registered voters. The 2021 presidential election had the highest abstention rate ever recorded at 60.76%, influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and automatic voter registration for Portuguese citizens abroad. In 2016, during Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa's first election, the abstention rate was 51.34%. The second round was held on Sunday in 20 municipalities and voting sections delayed by one week due to storm damage, involving approximately 36,000 registered voters.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 10:18 PM\nSource:[TVI](https://tvi.iol.pt/noticias/presidenciais-2026/eleicoes-presidenciais/abstencao-na-segunda-volta-subiu-para-50/20260215/699240d3d34e6a48f4469031)\n\n**Abstention in the Second Round of Portuguese Presidential Elections Increased to 50%**\nThe second round of the Portuguese presidential elections, which resulted in the election of Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro, recorded a voter abstention rate of 50%, an increase compared to the first round, according to final provisional data from the Secretaria-Geral do Minist\u00e9rio da Administra\u00e7\u00e3o Interna (SGMAI). A total of 11,039,672 voters were registered for the second round, held primarily on the previous Sunday, with 5,519,808 casting ballots. The first round, held on January 18, was the most competitive with 11 candidates and saw a voter turnout of 52.26% among nearly 11 million registered voters. The abstention rate in the 2021 presidential elections was 60.76%, the highest ever, influenced by the COVID-19 pandemic and the automatic registration of Portuguese citizens abroad. In 2016, during Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa\u2019s first election, the abstention rate was 51.34%. The second round was held in 20 freguesias and voting sections delayed by one week due to storm damage, involving approximately 36,000 registered voters. According to SGMAI\u2019s final provisional data, Ant\u00f3nio Jos\u00e9 Seguro won with over 3.5 million votes (66.83% of the valid votes), while Andr\u00e9 Ventura, his opponent, received 1.7 million votes (33.17%). There were also 175,000 blank votes (3.18%) and 98,000 null votes (1.79%). In the first round, Seguro received 31.11% of the votes, leading Andr\u00e9 Ventura, who secured 23.5%.

Despite a national female representation of 41.5% among over 505,000 municipal councilors, this drops to 37.6% in towns with fewer than 1,000 inhabitants, and only 17.5% of mayors are women. A new law mandates gender parity in candidate lists regardless of commune size, a significant shift for campaign teams struggling to comply. Although women's representation rose by 2.3 percentage points in 2020, studies by the Caisse des d\u00e9p\u00f4ts indicate they are less likely to be re-elected, raising questions about whether parity will translate into real influence. Abstention remains a growing concern: while 2020's record-high abstention (55.3% in the first round) was skewed by the pandemic-related lockdown, historical data from 2014 (60% participation) offers a better benchmark. A high abstention rate in 2026 would signal deepening distrust in institutions, despite 58% of French citizens still expressing confidence in municipal councils. Additionally, disinformation poses a serious threat, with foreign interference\u2014particularly from a Russian-linked network since February 2024\u2014targeting the French information space through fake websites, AI-generated content, and efforts to discredit candidates, media, and the electoral process. In response, the French government established a 'network for coordination and protection of elections,' uniting Viginum and Arcom, publishing campaign guides, and releasing weekly reports on interference. The 2026 municipal elections are thus seen as a critical rehearsal for the upcoming presidential election.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 08:04 PM\nSource:[actu.fr](https://actu.fr/politique/elections-municipales/municipales-2026-abstention-parite-desinformation-les-trois-autres-enjeux-majeurs-du-scrutin_63827567.html)\n\n**Marseille 2026 Municipal Elections: Will the 2020 Abstention Record Be Surpassed?**\nIn Marseille, voter registration for the 2026 municipal elections remains open until Friday evening. In the 2020 municipal elections, during the COVID-19 pandemic, 67% of registered voters did not participate\u2014higher than the national average of 58%. Some arrondissements, including the 3rd, 14th, and 15th, saw abstention rates exceed 80%. In the Saint Barth\u00e9l\u00e9my neighborhood (13th arrondissement), abstention reached 88%. As of February 5, 2026, nearly two months before the first round on March 15, the trend of low turnout persists in northern neighborhoods, with residents expressing disillusionment, citing 'politicians come and go, nothing changes, they are liars who prioritize personal agendas.' However, some remain determined to vote, viewing participation as a right that can 'change the city.' Alexandre Pastor from the Melting Pot association emphasizes that educating citizens\u2014especially youth\u2014on the role of the mayor can inspire voter engagement, stating: 'Well identifying what the mayor does gives people the desire to vote.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 05, 2026 06:04 PM\nSource:[France Bleu](https://www.francebleu.fr/provence-alpes-cote-d-azur/bouches-du-rhone-13/marseille/municipales-2026-a-marseille-l-abstention-record-de-2020-va-t-elle-reculer-2452543)\n\n**Municipal Elections 2020: A Record Abstention Amid Pandemic Disruptions in France and Aveyron**\nThe 2020 French municipal elections were unprecedented due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the first round held on March 15, 2020, amid public health concerns. President Emmanuel Macron decided to maintain the election despite pressure to postpone it, but the second round was delayed until June 28, 2020, due to the nationwide lockdown beginning March 17. The first round saw a national voter turnout of 57.30% in Aveyron\u201415 percentage points higher than the national average\u2014while the national abstention rate reached a record 56%, up from 36.45% in 2014. In urban centers like N\u00eemes, abstention approached 70%. The second round had a turnout of 34.67%, significantly lower than the 52.36% in 2014, with a 58% abstention rate. Regional President Carole Delga criticized the process, calling it 'a great mess' and suggesting to retain results for already-elected officials while rescheduling the remaining rounds. Despite the disruptions, the elections proceeded, leaving a lasting impression of instability. A 2025 study by the think tank 'Destin commun' found that 60% of French citizens were already resolved to vote in the 2026 elections.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 05:01 AM\nSource:[centrepresseaveyron.fr](https://www.centrepresseaveyron.fr/2026/02/03/municipales-2026-en-2020-les-dernieres-elections-marquees-par-le-covid-et-une-abstention-record-13202614.php)\n\n**Abstention, Legitimacy... What Remains of 2020 for the March Elections?**\nThe 2020 French municipal elections were unprecedented due to the COVID-19 pandemic, with the first round held on March 15, 2020, and the second round delayed to June 28, 2020\u201415 weeks later\u2014due to nationwide lockdowns starting March 17.

In contrast, Aveyron recorded a 57.3% turnout\u201415 points above the national average\u2014demonstrating strong civic engagement in rural regions. The second round had a turnout of 34.67%, significantly lower than the 52.36% in 2014, with a national abstention rate of 58%. Political leaders, including Carole Delga, president of Occitanie Region, criticized the process, calling it 'a great mess' and suggesting to retain elected officials while postponing the remaining rounds.

This trend is illustrated by the 2014 municipal election data: Aix-en-Provence recorded a 41.01% abstention rate in the second round, Avignon 34.6%, while smaller communes like Saint-Savournin had only 28.35% abstention and Reillanne just 16.21%. These figures contrast with the national average abstention rate of 36.3%.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 06:41 AM\nSource:[LaProvence.com](https://www.laprovence.com/article/elections/13677965917366/municipales-2026-face-a-l-abstention-pourquoi-les-grandes-villes-sont-en-premiere-ligne?id=13677965917366)\n\n**Municipal 2026: What Were the Voter Turnout Rates in 2020?**\nThe 2020 French municipal elections saw a significant decline in voter turnout, with a national participation rate of 44.66% in the first round\u2014down nearly 19 percentage points from 2014\u2014and 41.86% in the second round, a drop of about 20 points compared to 2014. This decline is attributed to the challenging context of the Covid-19 pandemic during the election period. Prior to 2020, turnout in 2014 and 2008 had remained relatively high, both exceeding 60%, reflecting the historically strong voter engagement in municipal elections, which are among the most participated-in French elections alongside presidential ones. The upcoming 2026 municipal elections are scheduled for March 15 and 22, with voter turnout expected to be closely monitored as abstention continues to rise in France.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 06:17 AM\nSource:[CNEWS](https://www.cnews.fr/france/2026-02-01/municipales-2026-quels-etaient-les-taux-de-participation-en-2020-1808712)\n\n**Municipal Elections of 2020: High Abstention and Questionable Legitimacy in France**\nThe 2020 French municipal elections, held during the Covid-19 pandemic, were marked by historically high abstention rates, with 55% turnout in the first round and 60% in the second\u201440 points higher than the 1983 municipal elections and 20 points above 2014. This unprecedented drop in voter participation, attributed to lockdowns and public fear, led to a significant shift in power toward left-wing, green-leaning candidates in major cities such as Bordeaux, Marseille, Lyon, Strasbourg, and Besan\u00e7on. In Bordeaux, Pierre Hurmic won with 46% of the vote against 44% for his conservative rival, despite 68% abstention. In Marseille, the leftist list led by Rubirola won with only 35% turnout and 38% of the vote, later ceding the mayoralty to Beno\u00eet Payan\u2014a figure not elected by the public and described by Le Monde as a 'pur product of the old system' and the move labeled a 'trick' due to lack of transparency. In smaller cities like Roubaix (77.25% abstention) and Vitry-sur-Seine (77.39% abstention), elected mayors represented less than 13% and 11% of registered voters, respectively. The article argues that these results, with 57% of cities over 100,000 inhabitants under left-wing control, were illegitimate and unrepresentative, and warns that the 'atypical' nature of elections under exceptional circumstances has enabled political manipulation. The piece concludes by urging voters in the 2026 elections to vote en masse against the left and Macronism to restore democratic legitimacy.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 10:30 AM\nSource:[Boulevard Voltaire](https://www.bvoltaire.fr/municipales-ces-chiffres-dil-y-a-6-ans-a-bien-avoir-en-tete-en-votant-en-mars/)\n\n**2026 Municipal Elections in Landes: A Guide to the Key Steps Before Voting**\nIn the Landes department of France, the process for the 2026 municipal elections is outlined, with the mandatory submission of candidacies required for all lists.
