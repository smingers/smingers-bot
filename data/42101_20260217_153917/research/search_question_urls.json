The source data comes from TNS Sofres, based on Pierre Br\u00e9chon's work \"La France aux urnes, 60 ans d'histoire \u00e9lectorale\" (La Documentation fran\u00e7aise, 2009).\n\n### Political Commentary (2014-specific):\nThe article concludes with political analysis specific to 2014, suggesting that increased abstention would likely confirm or amplify a \"blue wave\" (conservative victory), and that the Socialist Party's hope to limit defeat depended on strong second-round mobilization.\n\n**Note:** This article provides historical context through 2014 but does not contain data or analysis specific to the 2026 elections.\n</QuestionSource>\n"
