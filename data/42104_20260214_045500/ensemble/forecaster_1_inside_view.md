Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Élections Québec official sources (February 7, 12, 2026):** Administrative announcements confirming 7 candidates, ~45,700 electors, advance polling dates. Highest reliability - direct from electoral authority. Purely factual, no predictive content.

**Le Quotidien (January 29, 2026):** Contains **critical polling data** - Pallas Data poll (January 22, 2026, n=311):
- PQ: 29%, PCQ: 19%, CAQ: 12%, PLQ: 12%, QS: 8%, Undecided: 27%
- **Factual polling data from identifiable source (Pallas Data)**
- Opinion from Éric Duhaime (PCQ leader) claiming two-way race - this is partisan advocacy, not expert analysis
- Key fact: 50% of 2022 CAQ voters no longer supporting CAQ

**TVA Nouvelles (February 7, 2026):** Reports different poll showing PQ: 29%, PCQ: 19%, PLQ: 9%, CAQ: 8%, QS: 7%. Consistent with Le Quotidien poll, suggesting same source. Includes opinion from Ruba Ghazal (QS) - partisan perspective, not expert analysis.

**La Presse (December 8, 2025):** Historical context - Qc 125 aggregator showing PQ: 57%, CAQ: 22%, PCQ: 8% in Chicoutimi. **This is projection/modeling, not direct polling**. Notes PQ won last three by-elections (Jean-Talon, Terrebonne, Arthabaska).

**Radio Canada articles (January-February 2026):** Multiple articles confirming candidates, campaign activities. Notes historical PQ dominance 1973-2018. Factual reporting with no predictive analysis.

**CityNews Montreal (February 7, 2026):** Confirms 2022 result: Laforest (CAQ) won with 14,930-vote majority. Editorial characterization of Laflamme as "main opponent" - opinion without attribution.

**Key factual evidence identified:**
1. **Strong evidence:** January 22, 2026 Pallas Data poll showing PQ 29%, PCQ 19%, CAQ 12% (identifiable source, clear methodology, recent)
2. **Strong evidence:** Historical pattern - PQ won 3 consecutive by-elections in CAQ-held seats (Jean-Talon, Terrebonne, Arthabaska)
3. **Strong evidence:** 2022 result - CAQ won with 62% (28,502 votes), PQ 14.2% (6,507 votes) - 22,000-vote margin
4. **Moderate evidence:** 50% of 2022 CAQ voters no longer supporting CAQ (from poll)
5. **Moderate evidence:** Historical PQ dominance 1973-2018 (45 years)
6. **Weak evidence:** Qc 125 projection of "solid PQ" (modeling, not direct measurement)

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong evidence:**
- **Pallas Data poll (January 22, 2026):** Most recent direct measurement shows PQ leading by 10 points over PCQ, 17 points over CAQ. However, 27% undecided is substantial. Poll conducted 32 days before election - enough time for movement.
- **Recent by-election pattern:** 3/3 CAQ seats flipped to PQ demonstrates clear trend. However, each riding has unique characteristics.
- **2022 baseline:** CAQ's 62% victory was massive. A 50-point swing in 3.5 years would be unprecedented in Quebec politics.

**Critical tension:** The polling shows PQ ahead but with only 29% support and high undecideds. The 2022 result showed CAQ dominance. The question is whether the provincial trend (CAQ collapse) fully translates to this specific riding.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **CAQ voter defection:** 50% of 2022 CAQ voters switching is dramatic but doesn't specify where they're going. Could split among PQ, PCQ, undecided.
- **Historical PQ strength:** Relevant but CAQ broke this pattern decisively in 2018-2022.

**Weak evidence:**
- **Qc 125 projection:** Useful but derivative of polling, not independent evidence.
- **Campaign narratives:** PCQ claiming "two-way race," QS expressing hope - these are partisan positioning, not predictive.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction timeframe:** 9 days until February 23, 2026 election.

**If halved (4-5 days):** Would increase confidence in current polling snapshot. Less time for undecideds to break or campaigns to shift dynamics. Would slightly increase PQ probability.

**If doubled (18 days):** Would decrease confidence in January 22 poll. More time for CAQ to recover or PCQ to consolidate opposition. Would increase uncertainty, spreading probability more evenly.

**Current assessment:** 9 days with 27% undecided means significant movement is possible. The January 22 poll is 32 days old by election day - enough time for substantial shifts. Advance voting (February 15-16) will lock in some votes before final campaign push.

**(d) Justification:**

**Outside view established:** PQ 85%, CAQ 10%, PCQ 3%, others minimal.

**Adjustments needed based on inside view:**

**Factor 1 - Polling vs. Outside View:** The Pallas poll shows PQ at only 29%, not the dominant position suggested by 85% probability. With 27% undecided, the race is more fluid than outside view suggests.

**Factor 2 - PCQ emergence:** Poll shows PCQ at 19%, not 3%. Catherine Morissette (former mayor) has credible local profile. PCQ is consolidating right-wing opposition to PQ.

**Factor 3 - CAQ floor:** Despite collapse, CAQ still at 12% in poll with organizational advantages of incumbency. The 10% outside view may be too low.

**Factor 4 - Vote efficiency question:** PQ leading with 29% suggests multi-way split. In first-past-the-post, 29% could win, but it's not dominant. The outside view's 85% assumes PQ consolidates opposition, but polling shows fragmentation.

**Factor 5 - Time for movement:** 32 days from poll to election with 27% undecided means final outcome highly uncertain. The "solid PQ" characterization may be premature.

**Recalibration logic:**

The outside view was based on:
- Recent by-election pattern (3/3 PQ wins)
- Historical PQ strength
- CAQ provincial collapse

The inside view reveals:
- PQ leading but not dominant (29%)
- Significant PCQ challenge (19%)
- High uncertainty (27% undecided)
- Multi-way race, not binary

**Key insight:** The outside view assumed PQ would consolidate anti-CAQ vote. The polling shows this hasn't happened - opposition is split between PQ, PCQ, and others.

**Probability Calibration:**

**PQ adjustment:** 85% → 60%
- Leading in poll but only at 29%
- Multi-way split reduces certainty
- Historical strength and recent pattern still favor PQ
- 27% undecided could break toward frontrunner

**PCQ adjustment:** 3% → 25%
- Poll shows 19%, second place
- Credible candidate (former mayor)
- Consolidating right-wing vote
- Could benefit from strategic anti-PQ voting

**CAQ adjustment:** 10% → 10%
- Poll shows 12%, consistent with outside view
- Organizational advantages
- But provincial collapse and recent losses limit upside

**PLQ adjustment:** 1% → 2%
- New leader (Milliard) provides fresh narrative
- But historically weak in region
- Poll shows 9-12% range

**QS adjustment:** 1% → 2%
- Poll shows 7-8%
- Active campaign but limited regional base

**Other adjustment:** 0% → 1%
- Climat Québec and PPQ present but marginal

**Consistency check with undecideds:** 27% undecided in poll must break somehow. Likely distribution:
- PQ: 40% of undecideds (historical strength, leading) = +11%
- PCQ: 30% of undecideds (momentum, anti-establishment) = +8%
- CAQ: 15% of undecideds (incumbency) = +4%
- Others: 15% of undecideds = +4%

**Final calibration:**
- PQ: 29% (poll) + 11% (undecided share) = 40% base → 60% win probability
- PCQ: 19% (poll) + 8% (undecided share) = 27% base → 25% win probability
- CAQ: 12% (poll) + 4% (undecided share) = 16% base → 10% win probability
- PLQ: 10% (poll) + 1% (undecided share) = 11% base → 2% win probability
- QS: 8% (poll) + 1% (undecided share) = 9% base → 2% win probability
- Other: 1% win probability

Probability calibration:

The outside view of 85% PQ was too confident given the polling reality. The January 22 poll shows a competitive race with high uncertainty. PQ is the clear favorite but not overwhelmingly so. PCQ's emergence as a credible second option significantly changes the dynamics from the simple "CAQ collapse → PQ victory" narrative.

The 60% PQ probability reflects:
- Leading in only available poll
- Historical strength and recent by-election pattern
- Likely to consolidate some undecided voters
- But facing real competition from PCQ

The 25% PCQ probability reflects:
- Strong second place in polling
- Credible local candidate
- Potential to consolidate right-wing opposition
- But less historical organizational strength

The remaining 15% spread across CAQ (organizational advantages but toxic brand), PLQ (new leader but weak regionally), QS (active but limited base), and others reflects the multi-way nature of the race.

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Which party wins Chicoutimi by-election on February 23, 2026, as officially reported by Élections Québec.

2. **Base rate:** Outside view was PQ 85%, CAQ 10%, PCQ 3%, others 2%. Current circumstances (polling showing multi-way race with high undecideds) differ substantially from assumed PQ consolidation.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = PQ (60%); Second = PCQ (25%); Least likely = Other (1%). This aligns with polling showing PQ lead but competitive race with PCQ.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Pallas poll (Jan 22): PQ 29%, PCQ 19%, CAQ 12%, 27% undecided - factually valid
   - PQ won last 3 CAQ-held by-elections - factually valid
   - 2022: CAQ won with 62% in this riding - factually valid
   - 50% of 2022 CAQ voters defected - from poll, factually valid
   - 9 days until election with high undecideds - factually valid

5. **Blind spot:** PCQ consolidates as the "change" option and wins with 35-40% as undecideds break against both establishment parties (PQ and CAQ). This would make the 60% PQ forecast look overconfident. Would shift to PCQ 50%, PQ 35%, others 15%.

6. **Status quo:** 2022 status quo was CAQ dominance (62%). Current polling shows this has completely collapsed. The "new status quo" from recent by-elections is PQ victories, but polling suggests this is not yet locked in. Given volatility and 9-day timeframe, slight hedge toward uncertainty (spreading probability) is warranted.

7. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.
