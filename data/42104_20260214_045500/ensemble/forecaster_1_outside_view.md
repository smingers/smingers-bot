Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Élections Québec procedural page (March 10, 2022):** Administrative template with no substantive information about the 2026 by-election. Not useful for forecasting.

**Yahoo Finance/CNW (February 7, 2026):** Official announcement confirming 7 authorized candidates and ~45,700 electors. High reliability as it's from Élections Québec. Purely factual, no analysis.

**CBC (January 20/26, 2026):** High-quality journalistic source. Key facts: 
- CAQ has lost 3 consecutive by-elections in formerly-held ridings, all to PQ
- CAQ "slumping in polls for months"
- PQ described as "current favourite to form next provincial government"
- Lists 6 of 7 candidates
The characterization of PQ as favorite appears to be CBC's editorial assessment rather than attributed expert opinion.

**CityNews Montreal (February 7, 2026):** Comprehensive candidate list with backgrounds. Critical historical data: Laforest (CAQ) won 2022 with 14,930-vote majority over PQ. Notes Chicoutimi was "long a PQ stronghold" before 2018. The description of Laflamme as "main opponent" is unattributed editorial opinion.

**CityNews Montreal (January 20, 2026):** Earlier report confirming election date and noting historical PQ strength pre-2018. Factual reporting.

**Montreal Gazette (date unclear, likely January 2026):** Contains crucial polling data:
- CAQ support dropped from 41% (2022) to 11% in latest poll (province-wide)
- QC 125 projects riding as "solid PQ"
- Laforest won 2022 with 62% of vote
- Riding held by PQ from 1973-2018 (45 years)
This is the most analytically valuable source, citing specific polling aggregator projections.

**Quebec government notice (January 30, 2026):** Administrative information only. Not useful for forecasting.

**Agent Report:** Confirms 7 candidates including François Sabourin (PPQ) and Olivier Dion (Climat Québec). Notes complete absence of riding-specific polls. Identifies historical elections but lacks detailed vote breakdowns. The report correctly notes data gaps but confirms the candidate slate.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Recent Quebec by-elections in CAQ-held seats (2023-2026):** Most relevant. CAQ has lost 3 consecutive by-elections (Jean-Talon, Terrebonne, Arthabaska), all to PQ. This demonstrates a clear pattern of CAQ weakness and PQ strength in by-elections during this period.

2. **Chicoutimi historical voting patterns (1973-2022):** Shows 45-year PQ dominance (1973-2018), then CAQ wins in 2018 and 2022. The 2016 by-election returned PQ with 46.72%. Suggests riding has PQ baseline with recent CAQ surge.

3. **By-elections during government unpopularity:** Governing parties typically underperform in by-elections when provincial polling is weak. CAQ's collapse from 41% to 11% is historically dramatic.

**Most suitable reference class:** Recent Quebec by-elections in CAQ-held seats (2023-2026), supplemented by Chicoutimi's historical PQ strength. The 3-0 PQ sweep of CAQ seats is highly predictive, especially given CAQ's catastrophic polling collapse.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction timeframe:** 9 days from analysis date (February 14) to election day (February 23, 2026).

**Historical patterns:**
- Chicoutimi 2022: CAQ won with 62% (14,930-vote majority)
- Chicoutimi 2018: CAQ first win (flipping from PQ)
- Chicoutimi 2016 by-election: PQ won with 46.72%, turnout 41.10%
- Chicoutimi 1973-2018: Continuous PQ hold

The riding's reversion to PQ in the 2016 by-election (during Liberal government) suggests by-elections favor the opposition in this riding. The current context—CAQ government collapse, PQ provincial surge, and 3 consecutive by-election losses—creates extremely unfavorable conditions for CAQ.

**(d) Justification:**

**Integration of factors:**

1. **Structural factors strongly favor PQ:**
   - 45-year PQ baseline (1973-2018)
   - 2016 by-election returned PQ during non-PQ government
   - Recent pattern: 3/3 CAQ-held by-elections flipped to PQ
   - QC 125 projects "solid PQ"

2. **CAQ collapse is unprecedented:**
   - Province-wide support: 41% → 11% (30-point collapse)
   - Despite winning 2022 with 62%, current environment is toxic
   - Legault resignation adds instability

3. **Candidate quality appears balanced:**
   - No obvious star candidates or scandals
   - Local profiles (CIUSSS employee vs. university administrator)

4. **Conservative/QS/Liberal vote-splitting:**
   - 7 candidates may fragment non-PQ vote
   - Conservatives and QS could draw from different pools
   - Liberal weakness (no early candidate) suggests minimal threat

5. **Turnout considerations:**
   - By-elections typically favor motivated opposition voters
   - 2016 by-election: 41% turnout
   - CAQ demoralization likely suppresses their turnout

The overwhelming evidence points to a PQ victory. The only scenario for CAQ would require: (a) riding-specific factors overriding provincial trends, (b) massive local organization advantage, (c) PQ vote-splitting among multiple opposition parties. None of these appear present.

**Outside view calibration:**

**(a) True probability assessment:**
I must avoid overconfidence while recognizing the strength of evidence. The 3/3 recent by-election pattern is powerful but not deterministic.

**(b) Previously established distributions:**
- Recent CAQ-held by-elections: PQ 100% (3/3)
- Chicoutimi by-elections during opposition periods: PQ won 2016
- Historical base: PQ held 1973-2018 (45 years)

**(c) Probability distinctions:**
The evidence suggests PQ is heavily favored (80-90% range), but not certain. CAQ retaining the seat would be a significant upset but not impossible (5-15% range).

**(d) Rate of upsets:**
Quebec by-elections can produce surprises, but the current pattern is remarkably consistent. The 3/3 PQ sweep suggests this is not random variance but a genuine realignment. However, local factors in individual ridings can matter—Laforest's 14,930-vote margin in 2022 was substantial.

**Calibration:**
- **PQ baseline:** 75% (based on 3/3 recent pattern + historical strength + projections)
- **Upward adjustment:** +10% for CAQ's catastrophic polling and "solid PQ" projection
- **Final PQ estimate:** 85%

- **CAQ baseline:** 15% (inverse of PQ, accounting for incumbency advantage and 2022 landslide)
- **Downward adjustment:** -5% for polling collapse and recent losses
- **Final CAQ estimate:** 10%

- **Other parties:** Conservatives (3%), QS (1%), Liberals (1%), Other (0%)
  - Conservatives: Former mayor candidate, some populist appeal
  - QS: Limited Saguenay presence
  - Liberals: Weak in region, late candidate
  - Climat Québec/PPQ: Marginal

Outside View Prediction:

CAQ: 10%
Parti Québécois (PQ): 85%
Quebec Liberal Party (PLQ): 1%
Québec solidaire (QS): 1%
Conservative Party of Quebec: 3%
Other: 0%
