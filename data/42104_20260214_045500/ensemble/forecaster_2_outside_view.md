Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Élections Québec procedural page (March 10, 2022):** Administrative template with no substantive information about the 2026 by-election. Not useful for forecasting.

**Yahoo Finance/CNW (February 7, 2026):** Official announcement from Élections Québec confirming 7 authorized candidates and key dates. High credibility, purely factual administrative information. No polling or political analysis.

**CBC Article (January 20/26, 2026):** High-quality Canadian journalism. Key facts:
- Vacancy caused by Andrée Laforest (CAQ) leaving to run for mayor (unsuccessful)
- CAQ has lost 3 consecutive by-elections since last general election (Jean-Talon, Terrebonne, Arthabaska) - all to PQ
- CAQ "slumping in the polls for months"
- PQ described as "current favourite to form next provincial government"
- François Legault stepped down as Premier less than a week before by-election announcement
The characterization of PQ as favorite appears to be editorial assessment, not attributed to specific polling.

**CityNews Montreal (February 7, 2026):** Reputable local news. Provides complete candidate list with 7 names and parties. Critical historical fact: In 2022, Laforest won with a majority of 14,930 votes ahead of PQ candidate. Before 2018, Chicoutimi was "long a PQ stronghold." CAQ first won in 2018.

**CityNews Montreal (January 20, 2026):** Earlier report confirming candidates known at that time and historical context about PQ's traditional strength in the riding pre-2018.

**Montreal Gazette (date unclear, likely January 2026):** Established newspaper. Key quantitative data:
- Laforest won 2022 with 62% of vote
- CAQ provincial support dropped from 41% (2022) to 11% in latest poll
- QC 125 projects riding as "solid PQ" 
- PQ won last 3 by-elections, all replacing resigned CAQ MNAs
- Riding was PQ from 1973-2018 (45 years)

**Gouvernement du Québec notices (January 30, 2026):** Administrative only, no forecasting value.

**Agent Report:** Confirms 7 candidates across parties. Notes complete absence of riding-specific polling. Identifies historical results but lacks precise numbers. The report correctly notes that detailed vote breakdowns exist in Élections Québec data but weren't accessed.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **Quebec by-elections 2023-2026 where CAQ held the seat:** Most specific and recent. CAQ lost all 3 (Jean-Talon, Terrebonne, Arthabaska) to PQ.
2. **Chicoutimi historical voting patterns:** PQ stronghold 1973-2018 (45 years), then CAQ 2018-2025 (7 years).
3. **By-elections during government decline:** When governing party is "slumping" (CAQ at 11% vs 41% in 2022).
4. **Saguenay region political trends:** Regional patterns may differ from provincial.

**Most suitable reference class:** Quebec by-elections 2023-2026 where CAQ previously held the seat, combined with Chicoutimi's historical PQ dominance. This captures both the immediate political environment (CAQ decline, PQ surge) and local political culture.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction timeframe:** 9 days (from February 14 to February 23, 2026).

**Historical patterns:**
- CAQ won Chicoutimi in 2018 during their initial breakthrough and 2022 with 62% (landslide)
- PQ held riding for 45 consecutive years (1973-2018)
- Recent pattern (2023-2026): 3/3 by-elections saw CAQ seats flip to PQ
- Current environment: CAQ support collapsed from 41% to 11% provincially; Premier Legault just resigned
- QC 125 projection: "solid PQ" if vote held today

The 9-day timeframe is too short for major shifts absent a dramatic event. By-election campaigns are typically decided by:
- National political winds (strongly favor PQ currently)
- Local candidate quality (no information available)
- Historical riding loyalty (PQ for 45 years vs CAQ for 7 years)
- Get-out-the-vote operations

**(d) Justification:**

**Strong PQ indicators:**
1. Perfect 3-0 record in recent CAQ-held by-elections
2. Riding's 45-year PQ history vs 7-year CAQ interlude
3. CAQ provincial collapse (41%→11%)
4. Premier resignation creates leadership vacuum
5. QC 125 projects "solid PQ"
6. PQ described as "favourite to form next government"

**CAQ retention factors:**
1. Won decisively in 2022 (62%, 14,930-vote margin)
2. Incumbency advantage (organization, name recognition)
3. By-elections can have idiosyncratic outcomes
4. Local candidate Francis Tremblay works in healthcare (potentially strong local profile)

**Other parties:**
- PLQ: No historical strength in this riding; party struggling provincially
- QS: Left-wing alternative but no track record here
- PCQ: Conservative option but Chicoutimi historically center-left
- Other (Climat Québec, PPQ): Fringe parties, negligible chance

**Base rate from reference class:** 3/3 recent CAQ-held by-elections went PQ = 100%. However, small sample size and Chicoutimi's 2022 landslide margin (62%) was larger than those ridings, suggesting some CAQ resilience possible.

Outside view calibration:

**(a) True probability vs hedging:** Must account for genuine uncertainty. While PQ appears heavily favored, by-elections can surprise. The 3/3 pattern is compelling but not deterministic.

**(b) Established distributions:** 
- Recent by-elections: PQ 100% (3/3)
- Historical Chicoutimi: PQ dominated for 45 years
- Current polling: No riding-specific data, but provincial trends overwhelmingly favor PQ

**(c) Probability precision:**
- 90% PQ = 9:1 odds (seems reasonable given evidence)
- 95% PQ = 19:1 odds (possibly overconfident given CAQ's 2022 landslide)
- 5-10% CAQ = accounts for possible local factors, candidate quality, residual organization

**(d) Upset rate:** By-elections historically have ~10-20% upset rate vs projections. However, when combined with:
- Perfect recent track record (3/3)
- Massive provincial swing
- Historical riding tendency
The upset probability should be lower, perhaps 5-10%.

**Calibrated assessment:**
- PQ: 85% (strong favorite but not certain)
- CAQ: 10% (residual strength from 2022 landslide, local factors)
- PCQ: 3% (conservative alternative in uncertain times)
- PLQ: 1% (minimal historical strength)
- QS: 1% (left alternative)
- Other: 0% (fringe parties)

Outside View Prediction:
CAQ: 10%
Parti Québécois (PQ): 85%
Quebec Liberal Party (PLQ): 1%
Québec solidaire (QS): 1%
Conservative Party of Quebec: 3%
Other: 0%
