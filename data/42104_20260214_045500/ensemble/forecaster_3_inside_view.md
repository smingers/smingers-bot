Analysis:

1) Resolution + options (paraphrase, <30 words)
Resolves Feb 23, 2026 to the party of the candidate officially reported elected in the 2026 Chicoutimi Quebec provincial by-election (per Élections Québec results page).

(a) Source analysis (what each says, quality, date)

**Élections Québec / Gouvernement du Québec notice (Feb 7, 2026)**  
- Content: Procedural/administrative: voting dates, advance polls, number of authorized candidates, electorate size.  
- Quality: Very high for logistics; zero signal on vote choice.  
- Use: Confirms candidate field exists and election is imminent.

**Yahoo Finance via CNW (Feb 7, 2026)**  
- Content: Reprints the same administrative facts as above.  
- Quality: High for the same logistical facts; no electoral signal.

**CityNews Montreal (Feb 7, 2026)**  
- Content: Candidate names by party; historical context that CAQ held seat; 2022 CAQ won by ~14,930 votes; pre-2018 PQ stronghold.  
- Quality: Good mainstream outlet; factual candidate list + credible history.  
- Use: Confirms the competitive set (PQ/PCQ/CAQ/PLQ/QS) and shows past CAQ strength vs longer-run PQ history.

**Le Quotidien (Jan 29, 2026)**  
- Content: Riding poll (Jan 22; n=311; phone). PQ 29, PCQ 19, CAQ 12, QS 8; PLQ 12 but candidate announced after poll; 27 undecided. Frames “two-way” PQ vs PCQ (partly via Duhaime messaging).  
- Quality: Regional paper; the poll is a single snapshot with modest sample; still meaningful because it’s riding-specific with disclosed field numbers.  
- Fact vs opinion: Poll numbers are factual claims; “two-way race” and Duhaime arguments are advocacy/opinion.

**TVA Nouvelles (Feb 7, 2026)**  
- Content: Repeats/aligns with same Pallas Data poll toplines (PQ 29, PCQ 19, PLQ 9, CAQ 8, QS 7) + 2022 results. QS leader expresses optimism (opinion).  
- Quality: Mainstream; poll mention corroborates direction of Le Quotidien numbers (PQ leads; PCQ second; CAQ very low).  
- Use: Independent confirmation that the “PQ leading / PCQ second / CAQ collapsed” picture is not a one-off reporting artifact.

**Radio-Canada (Feb 12, 2026) — PCQ flyer controversy**  
- Content: PCQ distributed flyer using PQ candidate photo; dispute about misleading presentation; Elections Québec says it regulates labeling requirements, not content/image use.  
- Quality: Very high; specific, attributable facts; useful for “campaign shock” assessment.  
- Use: Potential (small) downside risk to PCQ from backlash/ethics narrative, but magnitude unclear.

**Radio-Canada (Feb 9, 2026) — voting logistics + candidate list**  
- Content: Confirms all seven candidates and voting windows; mentions prior by-elections trend without analytical detail.  
- Quality: Very high for factual list; little predictive signal.

**Radio-Canada (Feb 13, 2026) — housing forum coverage**  
- Content: Candidate positioning on social housing; CAQ/PLQ/Climat signed pledges, PQ outlined program, PCQ did not sign binding commitments; QS meeting later.  
- Quality: High for what was said/done; limited for predicting votes.  
- Use: Weak-to-moderate: could matter at margin for persuadables.

**TVA Nouvelles (Feb 13, 2026) — advance voting location changes**  
- Content: ~10,000 voters had advance polling location changes; admin details.  
- Quality: Good; mostly operational.  
- Use: Slight turnout/operations uncertainty, but not directional by party without more.

**CBC News (Jan 20, 2026) — context piece**  
- Content: CAQ leadership turmoil; CAQ lost three recent by-elections (to PQ); frames PQ as strong provincewide.  
- Quality: High; but some “favorite” language is journalistic interpretation anchored in broader polls/trends.  
- Use: Background that by-election environment has been anti-CAQ.

**PLQ leadership items (Feb 13, 2026; CP via SooToday)**  
- Content: Charles Milliard acclaimed PLQ leader.  
- Quality: High for that fact; unclear relevance in a mostly francophone Saguenay riding and very late in campaign.  
- Use: Small potential for PLQ “new leader bump,” but timing is tight.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence (large shifts)
1) **Two independent reports citing the same riding poll picture (PQ ~29 leading; PCQ ~19 second; CAQ single digits/low teens).**  
   - Directionally strong: establishes CAQ not the main challenger; PCQ plausibly is.
2) **Structural recent pattern: CAQ has been losing by-elections; PQ has won last three (Jean-Talon, Terrebonne, Arthabaska).**  
   - Strong but not determinative; still a meaningful environment prior.

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
1) **Historic riding context**: CAQ landslide in 2022 vs much longer PQ dominance pre-2018.  
   - Suggests volatility: 2022 outcome alone is not stable under today’s provincial swings.
2) **Large undecided share (27%) in Jan 22 poll**  
   - Increases uncertainty; creates plausible pathways for PCQ upset or late consolidation.

Weak evidence (small tweaks)
1) **PCQ flyer controversy** could modestly hurt PCQ (or energize its base).  
2) **Advance poll location changes** could affect turnout slightly, unclear direction.  
3) **Issue-specific pledges (housing/environment)**: could move small slices but not clearly decisive.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left: **9 days** (Feb 14 → Feb 23).  
- If halved (≈4–5 days): I’d expect **less movement**; incumbency/org effects and existing poll snapshot dominate—slightly *higher* confidence in PQ lead holding.  
- If doubled (≈18 days): more time for **strategic voting coordination** (anti-PQ consolidation behind PCQ) or major campaign events; I’d widen tails (raise PCQ/CAQ a bit, lower PQ).

(d) Justification (how inside view updates outside view)

Outside view base rate distribution (given):  
CAQ 10, PQ 85, PLQ 1, QS 1, Conservative Party of Quebec 3, Other 0.

Key update vs outside view: the **riding-specific poll(s) make this look less like “PQ vs CAQ” and more like “PQ vs PCQ,”** with CAQ collapsing to low-teens/single digits. That materially changes the upset pathways:

- **Why PQ probability decreases from 85 → ~low 70s:**  
  - Poll shows PQ leads but **not near-majority**, and **PCQ is within plausible striking distance** given 27% undecided and potential anti-referendum/anti-PQ strategic coordination (a common by-election dynamic).  
  - By-election turnout is often lower and more elastic; that can amplify motivated challengers.

- **Why PCQ probability rises from 3 → high teens:**  
  - PCQ is consistently reported second in the only publicly described riding poll snapshot, far above its 2022 showing.  
  - The central “Yes” path for PCQ: CAQ vote continues to hemorrhage and disproportionately consolidates to PCQ late (strategic vote), while PQ fails to grow beyond its core.

- **Why CAQ drops from 10 → mid-single digits:**  
  - The poll picture (CAQ 8–12) implies CAQ is not merely “down,” but potentially **not competitive for first** unless the poll is badly wrong or there’s a major late CAQ-specific shock.

- **PLQ/QS remain low:**  
  - They poll in high single digits; could gain seat share but winning requires an implausible, very late provincewide/leader-driven surge plus local consolidation—little time.

Status quo if trends continue: **PQ wins**, PCQ second, CAQ third/fourth.

Probability calibration

I’m aiming to reflect (1) PQ advantage + by-election momentum, but (2) meaningful uncertainty from a three-way fragmentation and large undecideds, where PCQ is the clear alternative beneficiary.

- PQ: still the modal outcome with multiple reinforcing signals (recent by-election performance; riding history pre-2018; current CAQ weakness).  
- PCQ: the main upset risk (strategic anti-PQ consolidation).  
- CAQ: nonzero but needs a “poll miss + late rally” scenario.  
- PLQ/QS/Other: mostly spoiler roles.

Checklist:
1) Options/criteria paraphrase: done; resolves to elected party per Élections Québec on Feb 23, 2026.  
2) Outside view base rate stated: [10, 85, 1, 1, 3, 0].  
3) Consistency check: Most likely=PQ; Least likely=Other (also QS/PLQ). Yes—matches evidence and by-election dynamics.  
4) Top evidence (3–5, <20 words each):
   - Riding poll: PQ ~29 leads; PCQ ~19 second; CAQ ~8–12.  
   - 27% undecided in poll → large late-movement potential.  
   - CAQ lost last three by-elections; PQ won all three.  
   - 2022 CAQ landslide vs today’s reported CAQ collapse.  
5) Blind spot: A strong late strategic-vote wave to PCQ (or a big polling error) flips the seat.  
6) Status quo: PQ lead holds; adjust slightly toward stability but keep PCQ upset meaningful.  
7) Technicalities: Probabilities 0–100, sum to 100, no percent signs.

Probabilities: [6, 72, 3, 1, 18, 0]
