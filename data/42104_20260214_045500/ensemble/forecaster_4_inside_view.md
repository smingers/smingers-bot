Analysis
========
1. Source analysis (key items only; all dates ≤ 14 Feb 2026)  
a. Le Quotidien 29-Jan poll (Pallas Data, n=311, Jan 22).  Factual topline: PQ 29 | PCQ 19 | CAQ 12 | PLQ 12* | QS 8, 27 % undecided.  Single, small-sample telephone poll commissioned by PCQ—methodology disclosed—reliable enough for direction, but margin of error ~±6 pp; possible sponsor bias.  
b. TVA Nouvelles 07-Feb article repeats the same Pallas figures (PQ 29 | PCQ 19 | PLQ 9 | CAQ 8 | QS 7).  Independent confirmation → strengthens confidence.  
c. CBC 20-Jan & Gazette summaries: CAQ has lost last three CAQ-held by-elections to PQ; Legault stepping down. High-quality national outlets; historical, verifiable.  
d. CityNews 07-Feb candidate list + 2022 results (CAQ 62 %, PQ 14 %).  Reliable factual baseline.  
e. Radio-Canada 12-Feb flyer story shows PCQ campaign aggressiveness; weak evidence of voter impact.  
f. Official Élections Québec notices (7 Feb, 13 Feb) – logistics only; no bearing on vote intent.  

2. Evidence weighting  
Strong:  
• Historical pattern: three straight CAQ→PQ by-election flips (structural/provincial protest)  
• Riding history: PQ held Chicoutimi 1973-2018 (institutional memory)  
Moderate:  
• Two independent mentions of same Pallas poll showing PQ lead & CAQ collapse  
• CAQ leadership turmoil five weeks before vote; turnout penalty for governing party  
• PCQ polling at ~19 % (tripling 2022 vote) – real but untested ceiling  
Weak:  
• Candidate-level anecdotes (flyer controversy, housing pledges)  
• One small sample poll only; undecided 27 % leaves room for swing  

3. Timeframe  
9 days to election.  In half the time (4-5 days) probabilities would converge further on observed trend; in double (18 days) more campaigning could help CAQ/PCQ, slightly widening tails.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside base (Feb 14 morning): PQ 62 | CAQ 28 | Others 10.  
Inside information since:  
• Corroborated poll shows CAQ even weaker (8-12 %), PCQ clearly second. → shift 6 pp from CAQ to PCQ.  
• CAQ leadership crisis, media narrative of “collapse” – lowers turnout enthusiasm → –4 pp CAQ, +2 pp PQ, +2 pp PCQ.  
• High undecided + by-election volatility keep non-PQ paths alive; allocate 2 pp from PQ to uncertainty bucket (PLQ/QS/Other).  

Calibrated inside view
======================
CAQ … protest headwinds, but residual brand + vote-splitting ≈ 12 % win chance.  
PQ … momentum, historic base, polling lead ≈ 65 %.  
PCQ … surge possibility if it captures ex-CAQ vote & turnout favours right, ≈ 17  %.  
PLQ … minimal francophone support, leader just acclaimed, ≈ 3  %.  
QS … organisational strength modest in region, ≈ 2  %.  
Other … remaining tail risk, ≈ 1  %.

Checklist
---------
1. Options = party of officially elected candidate in Chicoutimi on 23 Feb 2026.  
2. Outside view recapped above.  
3. Most likely = PQ; least likely = Other.  Makes sense? Yes.  
4. Key evidence:  
   – Pallas poll twice reported (PQ 29 %, CAQ 8-12 %).  
   – Three consecutive CAQ→PQ by-election flips.  
   – Chicoutimi PQ stronghold 45 yrs pre-2018.  
   – CAQ leadership vacuum / slump.  
5. Blind spot: very low turnout with ex-CAQ voters breaking late to PCQ, giving PCQ plurality. Would push PCQ to ≈40  %, PQ to ≈45  % → probabilities PCQ↑, PQ↓.  
6. Status-quo (CAQ hold) now unlikely but not impossible; ensured 12  %.  
7. Numbers 0-100, sum = 100.

Probabilities: [12, 65, 3, 2, 17, 1]
