Analysis
1. Paraphrase (<30 words).  By-election in Chicoutimi, polling day 23 Feb 2026.  Question resolves to the party whose candidate Élections Québec reports elected.  Options: CAQ, PQ, PLQ, QS, PCQ, Other.

2. Outside-view base distribution (built 14 Feb):  
CAQ 25, PQ 60, PLQ 5, QS 6, PCQ 3, Other 1.

----------------------------------------------------
(a) Source analysis (chronological highlights)

• Le Quotidien 29 Jan 26 – single riding poll (Pallas Data, n = 311, 22 Jan): PQ 29, PCQ 19, CAQ 12, PLQ 12*, QS 8, 27 % undecided (*PLQ candidate announced after field-work).  Method disclosed, small sample; moderate reliability.

• TVA Nouvelles 7 Feb – same poll figures repeated; confirms CAQ malaise.  No new data; secondary source.

• CityNews 7 Feb – official list of seven candidates, 2022 result (CAQ 62 %).  Pure facts, high quality.

• CBC / La Presse / CNW 20 Jan–7 Feb – notices of writ, candidate confirmations, turnout logistics.  Factual, high quality.

• Radio-Canada 12 Feb – flap over PCQ flyer; confirms only one published poll so far shows PQ leading.  Weak evidence on voter sentiment.

• Radio-Canada 13 Feb – housing debate article; shows each candidate’s positions, no polling.  Factual background.

All other AskNews items concern administrative details or unrelated events—ignored for forecasting.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong:  
• Recent Quebec by-election pattern: CAQ lost 3 straight seats to PQ (structural, independent sources).

Moderate:  
• Pallas Data poll giving PQ +10 pp over nearest rival with 27 % undecided; only local poll, transparent but small (n = 311).  
• Province-wide polling (QC125, Léger, Mainstreet) shows CAQ vote collapsing to low-teens while PQ leads (~35 %).  
• Historical Chicoutimi trend: PQ held seat 1973-2018, lost only in two CAQ landslides.

Weak:  
• PCQ and QS claims of late-campaign surge – partisan statements, anecdotal ground reports.  
• 2022 CAQ organisational strength – could matter but contradicted by recent by-election turnout.

(c) Timeframe analysis

Nine days until result.  Advance voting (15-16 Feb) locks in a share of ballots.  Late swings of >10 pp in Quebec by-elections over final week are rare (<10 % of cases).  If the horizon were halved (4-5 days), uncertainty would shrink slightly – I would raise top option ~3 pts.  If doubled (18 days), more room for scandals or leadership bounce; probability on non-PQ options +5 pts.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments

Shifts away from outside view:

+8 pts to PCQ: the poll plus Duhaime’s visible campaign suggest a plausible second-place finish; Saguenay region leans right at federal level.  
−11 pts from CAQ: leadership vacuum, 62 %→~12 % in local poll, three straight losses show organisation not preventing voter desertion.  
+10 pts to PQ: lead in only poll, historical home turf, momentum from other by-elections, benefits from CAQ collapse.  
−3 pts combined from PLQ/QS/Other: no signs of breakthrough; PLQ leadership race only mildly energising.

After normalising I obtain:

CAQ 14, PQ 70, PLQ 2, QS 2, PCQ 10, Other 2.

Checklist

Consistency: Most likely = PQ, least likely = PLQ/QS; aligns with evidence.

Key evidence (≤20 words each)

1. Pallas Data poll: PQ 29 %, next rival 19 %, CAQ 12 %.  
2. CAQ lost last three by-elections it previously held to PQ.  
3. Province-wide polling places CAQ third/fourth, PQ first.  
4. Chicoutimi historically PQ fortress until CAQ 2018-22 wave collapsed province-wide.  
5. No credible data showing CAQ rebound or PCQ overtaking PQ.

Blind-spot scenario: Anti-sovereignty vote coalesces behind PCQ in final week, turnout favours right; PCQ squeaks past PQ.

Status-quo bias check: Keeping some probability (14 %) for CAQ hold despite slump covers organisational incumbency and 2022 landslide.

Technicalities verified: probabilities 0-100, sum = 100.

Probabilities: [14, 70, 2, 2, 10, 2]
