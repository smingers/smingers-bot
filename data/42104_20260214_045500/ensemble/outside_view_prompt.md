<Agent_report>
Query: List declared candidates and parties for the 23 Feb 2026 Chicoutimi provincial by-election; include any riding-level polls or projections and show Chicoutimi results from the 2012, 2016 by-election, 2018, and 2022 Quebec elections
1. Declared candidates – 23 Feb 2026 Chicoutimi by-election  
   The writ was issued 20 Jan 2026; nominations closed 7 Feb 2026.  Three independent media reports all point to the same slate of seven party candidates, matching the count announced by Élections Québec’s press release of 7 Feb. (CNW/Yahoo via Gouvernement du Québec, 30 Jan 2026; CBC, 26 Jan 2026; CityNews, 7 Feb 2026).  Names and parties:

   • Francis Tremblay – Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ) (CBC, 26 Jan 2026)  
   • Marie-Karlynn Laflamme – Parti Québécois (PQ) (CBC, 26 Jan 2026)  
   • Tricia Murray – Quebec Liberal Party (PLQ) (CityNews, 26 Jan 2026)  
   • Jeanne Palardy – Québec Solidaire (QS) (CityNews, 20 Jan 2026)  
   • Catherine Morissette – Conservative Party of Quebec (PCQ) (CityNews, 20 Jan 2026)  
   • Olivier Dion – Climat Québec (CQ) (Yahoo/CNW release cited in Gouvernement du Québec notice, 30 Jan 2026)  
   • François Sabourin – Parti populaire du Québec (PPQ) (CityNews, 7 Feb 2026)

   Élections Québec’s “official list of candidates” JSON for the riding was referenced in the archives index but has not yet been downloaded; it should be consulted to confirm spelling and the presence of the PPQ nominee.  No independents are reported.

2. Riding-level polls or projections for the 2026 contest  
   Exhaustive news and web searches (including polling aggregators) turned up no riding-specific public opinion surveys, seat-projection model outputs or fundraising tallies for Chicoutimi since the seat became vacant.  The only Chicoutimi poll mentioned anywhere in the results is an unrelated Segma Recherche poll from June 2018 (CBC, 19 Jun 2018).  Conclusion: as of 14 Feb 2026 there are no publicly released polls or model projections for this by-election.

3. Historical election results for Chicoutimi  

   a) 11 Apr 2016 provincial by-election  
      – Winner: Mireille Jean (PQ) 46.72 % of valid votes; turnout 41.10 % (Élections Québec Results & Statistics table, retrieved 17 May 2021 index).  
      – Vote shares for other parties are still to be extracted from the CSV “Votes by candidate – By-election Chicoutimi 2016” listed in the data archives.

   b) 3 Oct 2022 general election  
      – Winner: Andrée Laforest (CAQ); majority 14 930 votes over the PQ candidate (CityNews, 7 Feb 2026).  Exact vote totals and percentages are not in the article; they are available in the open-data file “Votes by candidate – GE 2022” referenced in the archives index but not yet parsed here.

   c) 1 Oct 2018 general election  
      – The seat flipped from PQ to CAQ with Andrée Laforest’s first victory (Global News riding profile, 2018).  Detailed figures are likewise in the 2018 candidate-results CSV but absent from the media snippets.

   d) 4 Sept 2012 general election  
      – Incumbent Stéphane Bédard (PQ) re-elected (context from Global News 2014 election piece).  No numeric data surfaced in the search results; the 2012 results are contained in Élections Québec’s 2012 candidate CSV.

   The Élections Québec open-data portal (archives index, May 2021) lists separate CSV/JSON “Votes by candidate” files for each of the four contests above.  Downloading those files will supply the full vote and percentage breakdowns requested.

4. Remaining information gaps  
   • Confirmation of the final candidate list directly from Élections Québec’s JSON (would settle any doubt about the PPQ nominee and spellings).  
   • Full numeric results—votes and percentages—for:  
     – Chicoutimi 2012 general election  
     – Chicoutimi 2016 by-election (all parties except the PQ winner already noted)  
     – Chicoutimi 2018 general election  
     – Chicoutimi 2022 general election  
   • Any riding-level polling that might still be released before 23 Feb 2026 (none exists so far).

   Without these figures the historical section remains qualitative; importing the four small CSV files will complete the table in a few minutes.

The core descriptive elements of the original query have been addressed—candidate slate and the (non-existence) of polling—but precise past-result numbers are still missing and should be gathered from Élections Québec’s open data or from the Chicoutimi Wikipedia page (which cites the same data).  No additional information appears necessary beyond those quantitative details.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
