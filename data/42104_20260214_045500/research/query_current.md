Analysis:
To forecast the winner of the Chicoutimi by-election we need very recent, local information:  
• Official list of nominated candidates and their party affiliations (Élections Québec, party press releases).  
• Riding-level polling or province-wide polls with riding breakdowns or modelling (Léger, Mainstreet, Québec 125, poll aggregator blogs).  
• Campaign-specific news: visits by party leaders, controversies, endorsements, ground game assessments, demographic shifts.  
• Historical context: 2022 general-election result (CAQ won with ~53 %), any resignation/issue that triggered the by-election, PQ and QS momentum in Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean region.  
Because Chicoutimi media are predominantly francophone, French keywords (“élection partielle Chicoutimi 2026”) are important.
