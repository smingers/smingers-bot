Analysis:
To build an outside-view baseline I need:  
• Riding history – which parties have previously won Chicoutimi and by what margins (2012, 2016 by-election, 2018, 2022).  
• Current campaign facts – who the declared candidates are, any local or provincial polling, party momentum, recent Quebec by-election results.  
• News coverage over the last few weeks in Saguenay–Lac-Saint-Jean that might reveal ground strength, endorsements, or controversies.  
These elements will show whether the CAQ’s historic advantage is eroding in the face of a provincial PQ surge, helping estimate win probabilities.
