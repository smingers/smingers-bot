The Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec candidate, Francis Tremblay, pledged to support doubling the number of social housing units by 2040 and implementing rent controls, even if these positions diverge from his party\u2019s official stance. He emphasized the importance of recognizing the high cost of living and the need for accessible housing in Chicoutimi. Liberal candidate Tricia Murray, who previously lived in social housing and relied on social assistance, expressed strong personal commitment to helping tenants manage rising rents, stating she understands the difficulty of choosing between groceries and rent. Climat Qu\u00e9bec candidate Olivier Dion also committed to both of Loge m'entraide\u2019s proposals, including creating supervised housing units for individuals with significant support needs. PQ candidate Marie-Karlynn Laflamme highlighted her plan to facilitate affordable housing construction for entrepreneurs and revive the Acc\u00e8sLogis program. Conservative candidate Catherine Morissette, while the first to meet with Loge m'entraide\u2019s coordinator Sonia C\u00f4t\u00e9, did not sign any binding commitments; her team opposes new affordable housing and rent controls, though she supports housing cooperatives and non-profit organizations. Qu\u00e9bec solidaire candidate Jeanne Palardy is scheduled to meet with C\u00f4t\u00e9 on February 17, accompanied by housing spokesperson Andr\u00e9s Fontecilla. Parti populaire du Qu\u00e9bec candidate Fran\u00e7ois Sabourin has not confirmed whether he will meet with the organization before the election. The organization\u2019s goal is to ensure the next elected representative will advocate for residents\u2019 housing needs in government.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 09:45 PM\nSource:[Radio Canada](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2228904/election-partielle-caq-plq-loge-mentraide)\n\n**What You Need to Know This Friday: Terrebonne Election Voided, Charlotte Cardin Honored, and Disability Allocation Cut for Refugee Families**\nThe Supreme Court of Canada annulled the federal election result in the riding of Terrebonne on Friday, February 13, 2026, due to a one-vote margin, necessitating a by-election.

Initially, the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois candidate Nathalie Sinclair-Desgagn\u00e9 was declared the winner, but a judicial recount revealed the Liberal candidate, Tatiana Auguste, had won by a single vote. Sinclair-Desgagn\u00e9 petitioned the courts to void the results, citing that voter Emmanuelle Boss\u00e9 had received her mail-in ballot back due to a misprint on the return envelope. Elections Canada acknowledged the error but stated the results were already finalized. Auguste was sworn in as MP following the recount and had been representing the riding since then. A Superior Court judge previously rejected Sinclair-Desgagn\u00e9\u2019s request, calling the postal error 'human error' and not an electoral irregularity under federal law. The Supreme Court overturned this decision after hearing arguments earlier that day.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 06:39 PM\nSource:[CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/terrebonne-tatiana-auguste-supreme-court-result-9.7088850)\n\n**Supreme Court annuls result from spring federal election in Terrebonne riding**\nThe Supreme Court of Canada has annulled the result of the spring 2024 federal election in the Terrebonne riding, located in the Montreal area. Liberal candidate Tatiana Auguste had been declared the winner by a single vote over Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois candidate Nathalie Sinclair-Desgagn\u00e9. The decision followed a hearing in which Sinclair-Desgagn\u00e9\u2019s lawyer, Julius Grey, argued that the court must ensure the correct individual is seated in the House of Commons. The annulment stemmed from a voter\u2019s discovery that her special ballot, mailed in for the Bloc Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois, was not counted due to an address error on the envelope. A Superior Court judge had previously rejected a request for a new election in October 2025, ruling that the clerical error did not compromise the integrity of the electoral system. Auguste\u2019s legal team warned that labeling a minor administrative mistake as an election irregularity could open the door to widespread future challenges. The Supreme Court\u2019s ruling, published on February 14, 2026, overturns the lower court\u2019s decision.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 06:23 PM\nSource:[The Star](https://www.thestar.com/politics/canada-supreme-court-federal-election-terrebonne/article_4361da21-aadb-57e6-a822-467bc86afc75.html)\n\n**Qu\u00e9bec solidaire Commits to Creating a Protected Area South of Lake K\u00e9nogami**\nQu\u00e9bec solidaire (QS) has committed to advancing the creation of a protected area south of Lake K\u00e9nogami if its candidate, Jeanne Palardy, is elected in Chicoutimi on February 23, 2026. The initiative, led by the Association pour la protection du lac K\u00e9nogami (APLK) since 2004, aims to preserve biodiversity and maintain the lake\u2019s water quality. The project has been pending at the Ministry of Wildlife, Forests, and Parks for over 22 years. Jeanne Palardy stated in a Friday press release that if elected, she will prioritize the initiative, as residents of Chicoutimi have waited too long. \u00c9tienne Grandmont, the party\u2019s environment spokesperson, emphasized that designating the area as protected would safeguard a remarkable forest containing century-old yellow birch trees\u2014some nearly 450 years old\u2014and unlock significant recreational and tourism potential for the region. Lake K\u00e9nogami is the primary source of drinking water for most of Saguenay\u2019s population. Grandmont also noted the Quebec government\u2019s commitment to protect 30% of provincial territory by 2030, with QS highlighting that protected areas in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean remain overdue. Despite favorable resolutions from the Saguenay City Council and prior optimism from Jonqui\u00e8re MP Yannick Gagnon over 18 months ago, progress has stalled. Current evaluations of protected area proposals, including Lake K\u00e9nogami, are being conducted by the Regional Council on Environment and Sustainable Development, with final decisions expected by 2027.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 05:57 PM\nSource:[Radio Canada](https://ici.radio-canada.ca/nouvelle/2228777/qs-lac-kenogami-aplk)\n\n**Advance Voting Begins in Chicoutimi for By-Election Amid Polling Location Changes**\nThe advance voting period for the by-election in Chicoutimi began on Sunday and Monday, February 15 and 16, 2026, ahead of the final vote on February 23. Due to logistical constraints associated with by-elections, nearly 10,000 voters had their polling locations changed, with those originally assigned to Parc de la Rivi\u00e8re-du-Moulin now required to vote at three alternative sites: H\u00f4tel La Saguen\u00e9enne, Centre Joseph-Nio, and Chantier du P\u00e8re Alex. \u00c9ric Gagnon, the election director, confirmed that advance voting will be available from 9:30 a.m. to 8:00 p.m. on both days. The shift was necessitated by the limited time to secure venues after the by-election date was confirmed, as noted by \u00c9lections Qu\u00e9bec, which cited the lack of availability of the original venue. Signage will be installed at the new locations to prevent confusion. A total of 425 staff members will be mobilized to ensure smooth operations. As part of a civic engagement initiative, children accompanying voters may participate in a mock vote, with their ballots counted during the final results announcement on February 23. The election director emphasized strong local volunteer turnout, growing from about 2 to nearly 500 staff members. \u00c9lections Qu\u00e9bec urges voters to verify their polling location on their official notice to avoid confusion, reminding the public that the actual voting day is February 23.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 05:26 PM\nSource:[TVA Nouvelles](https://www.tvanouvelles.ca/2026/02/13/election-partielle-dans-chicoutimi-debut-du-vote-par-anticipation)\n\n**Deadline today to apply for Quebec Liberal leadership, Charles Milliard favoured**\nThe deadline to apply for the Quebec Liberal Party leadership is today, February 13, 2026. Charles Milliard, 46, former head of the Quebec federation of chambers of commerce, is the frontrunner, backed by the majority of the party caucus. He finished second in the previous leadership race, losing to Pablo Rodriguez, who resigned in December 2025 amid allegations of vote-buying and improper reimbursements. Milliard is campaigning to revitalize a party that has lost support among the francophone majority. His only confirmed opponent, Mario Roy, a farmer from Quebec\u2019s Beauce region, may be disqualified due to debts accumulated during the 2025 leadership race. The leadership race occurs during a pivotal moment in Quebec politics, as the Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec (CAQ) is also choosing a new leader following Premier Fran\u00e7ois Legault\u2019s announcement to step down.

PCQ candidate Catherine Morissette stated she was not consulted before the flyer\u2019s creation but expressed satisfaction with the outcome. She initially issued apologies on Facebook, later retracting them after seeing the PQ\u2019s own campaign material. The flyer, which featured contrasting quotes from both candidates\u2014Morissette on economic support for youth and families, and Laflamme on sovereignty through a referendum\u2014did not display the PQ logo, making its origin unclear. However, the name Patrice Raza, the official agent of Morissette\u2019s campaign, appeared in small print on the reverse. \u00c9ric Duhaime, PCQ leader, asserted the flyer complied with election laws, noting the law requires only the printer\u2019s and agent\u2019s names, not placement or font size. Elections Qu\u00e9bec confirmed it does not regulate content or image use, only labeling requirements. The PQ condemned the flyer as disrespectful and misleading, with Laflamme criticizing its failure to identify its source and reducing her campaign to independence alone. She emphasized her platform covers education, public safety, and health. The by-election in Chicoutimi, set for February 23, 2026, follows the resignation of former MP Andr\u00e9e Laforet.
