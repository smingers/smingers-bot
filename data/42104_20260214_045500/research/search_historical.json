Declared candidates \u2013 23 Feb 2026 Chicoutimi by-election  \n   The writ was issued 20 Jan 2026; nominations closed 7 Feb 2026.  Three independent media reports all point to the same slate of seven party candidates, matching the count announced by \u00c9lections Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s press release of 7 Feb. (CNW/Yahoo via Gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec, 30 Jan 2026; CBC, 26 Jan 2026; CityNews, 7 Feb 2026).  Names and parties:\n\n   \u2022 Francis Tremblay \u2013 Coalition Avenir Qu\u00e9bec (CAQ) (CBC, 26 Jan 2026)  \n   \u2022 Marie-Karlynn Laflamme \u2013 Parti Qu\u00e9b\u00e9cois (PQ) (CBC, 26 Jan 2026)  \n   \u2022 Tricia Murray \u2013 Quebec Liberal Party (PLQ) (CityNews, 26 Jan 2026)  \n   \u2022 Jeanne Palardy \u2013 Qu\u00e9bec Solidaire (QS) (CityNews, 20 Jan 2026)  \n   \u2022 Catherine Morissette \u2013 Conservative Party of Quebec (PCQ) (CityNews, 20 Jan 2026)  \n   \u2022 Olivier Dion \u2013 Climat Qu\u00e9bec (CQ) (Yahoo/CNW release cited in Gouvernement du Qu\u00e9bec notice, 30 Jan 2026)  \n   \u2022 Fran\u00e7ois Sabourin \u2013 Parti populaire du Qu\u00e9bec (PPQ) (CityNews, 7 Feb 2026)\n\n   \u00c9lections Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s \u201cofficial list of candidates\u201d JSON for the riding was referenced in the archives index but has not yet been downloaded; it should be consulted to confirm spelling and the presence of the PPQ nominee.  No independents are reported.\n\n2. Riding-level polls or projections for the 2026 contest  \n   Exhaustive news and web searches (including polling aggregators) turned up no riding-specific public opinion surveys, seat-projection model outputs or fundraising tallies for Chicoutimi since the seat became vacant.  The only Chicoutimi poll mentioned anywhere in the results is an unrelated Segma Recherche poll from June 2018 (CBC, 19 Jun 2018).  Conclusion: as of 14 Feb 2026 there are no publicly released polls or model projections for this by-election.\n\n3. Historical election results for Chicoutimi  \n\n   a) 11 Apr 2016 provincial by-election  \n      \u2013 Winner: Mireille Jean (PQ) 46.72 % of valid votes; turnout 41.10 % (\u00c9lections Qu\u00e9bec Results & Statistics table, retrieved 17 May 2021 index).  \n      \u2013 Vote shares for other parties are still to be extracted from the CSV \u201cVotes by candidate \u2013 By-election Chicoutimi 2016\u201d listed in the data archives.\n\n   b) 3 Oct 2022 general election  \n      \u2013 Winner: Andr\u00e9e Laforest (CAQ); majority 14 930 votes over the PQ candidate (CityNews, 7 Feb 2026).  Exact vote totals and percentages are not in the article; they are available in the open-data file \u201cVotes by candidate \u2013 GE 2022\u201d referenced in the archives index but not yet parsed here.\n\n   c) 1 Oct 2018 general election  \n      \u2013 The seat flipped from PQ to CAQ with Andr\u00e9e Laforest\u2019s first victory (Global News riding profile, 2018).  Detailed figures are likewise in the 2018 candidate-results CSV but absent from the media snippets.\n\n   d) 4 Sept 2012 general election  \n      \u2013 Incumbent St\u00e9phane B\u00e9dard (PQ) re-elected (context from Global News 2014 election piece).  No numeric data surfaced in the search results; the 2012 results are contained in \u00c9lections Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s 2012 candidate CSV.\n\n   The \u00c9lections Qu\u00e9bec open-data portal (archives index, May 2021) lists separate CSV/JSON \u201cVotes by candidate\u201d files for each of the four contests above.  Downloading those files will supply the full vote and percentage breakdowns requested.\n\n4. Remaining information gaps  \n   \u2022 Confirmation of the final candidate list directly from \u00c9lections Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s JSON (would settle any doubt about the PPQ nominee and spellings).  \n   \u2022 Full numeric results\u2014votes and percentages\u2014for:  \n     \u2013 Chicoutimi 2012 general election  \n     \u2013 Chicoutimi 2016 by-election (all parties except the PQ winner already noted)  \n     \u2013 Chicoutimi 2018 general election  \n     \u2013 Chicoutimi 2022 general election  \n   \u2022 Any riding-level polling that might still be released before 23 Feb 2026 (none exists so far).\n\n   Without these figures the historical section remains qualitative; importing the four small CSV files will complete the table in a few minutes.\n\nThe core descriptive elements of the original query have been addressed\u2014candidate slate and the (non-existence) of polling\u2014but precise past-result numbers are still missing and should be gathered from \u00c9lections Qu\u00e9bec\u2019s open data or from the Chicoutimi Wikipedia page (which cites the same data).  No additional information appears necessary beyond those quantitative details.</Agent_report>\n"
