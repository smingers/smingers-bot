Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**High-Quality Primary Sources:**

1. **Scramble.nl (Feb 9, 2026)**: Reports January 2026 had 19 deliveries with detailed breakdown by aircraft type and customer. Factual data from official Airbus reporting. Quality: Excellent, recent, factual.

2. **Simple Flying (Feb 10, 2026)**: Confirms 19 deliveries in January 2026 (15 A320neo family, 3 A220, 1 A350). Compares to Boeing's 46 deliveries. Quality: Good, corroborates primary data.

3. **Airbus 2025 Annual Report (Multiple sources, Jan 12-13, 2026)**: 793 total deliveries in 2025 (average 66/month). Order backlog at record 8,754 aircraft. Quality: Excellent - official company data.

4. **AeroTime/Aviation sources (Jan-Feb 2026)**: January 2026 was "slowest year start this decade." Notes supply chain constraints, particularly engines. Quality: Good for context.

5. **Mexico Business (Oct 30, 2025)**: A220 production delays, targeting 14/month by late 2026 from current 7-8/month. Nearly 10 aircraft removed from 2026 schedule. Quality: Moderate - dated but shows persistent constraints.

6. **Safran/CFM article (Feb 13, 2026)**: CFM cautious about increasing LEAP engine deliveries beyond agreed volumes. Stand-off between Airbus and Pratt & Whitney over engine supply. Airbus earnings Feb 19. Quality: Strong - identifies specific bottleneck.

**Key Factual Information:**
- January 2026: 19 deliveries (confirmed, multiple sources)
- 2025 annual: 793 deliveries (66/month average)
- Engine supply is primary constraint (Pratt & Whitney issues, CFM cautious)
- Airbus targeting 75 A320/month by 2027 (currently ~60)
- February 2023: 46 deliveries (from outside view)

**Expert Opinions:**
- Guillaume Faury (Airbus CEO): Acknowledged "significant supply chain issues," engines "trickiest parts"
- Olivier Andries (Safran CEO): CFM cautious about exceeding agreed volumes
- Mark Galardo (Air Canada): A350-1000 deliveries starting 2030 (shows long lead times)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (Large shifts warranted):**
- January 2026 = 19 deliveries: Multiple independent sources confirm this is the slowest decade start. This is a binding constraint signal, not seasonal variation.
- Engine supply bottleneck: Multiple sources (Safran/CFM article, CEO comments, A220 delays) identify engines as the critical path constraint. This is structural and won't resolve in weeks.
- Historical pattern: January 2025 (26) and January 2024 (30) were both higher than January 2026 (19), showing deterioration not improvement.

**Moderate Evidence (Moderate shifts):**
- February 2023 = 46 deliveries: Single historical data point showing February can be 2.4x January, but from different constraint environment.
- 2025 monthly average = 66: Shows theoretical capacity exists, but current constraints prevent reaching it.
- Shorter month: February has 28 days vs 31 in January (10% fewer working days), though production lines operate continuously.

**Weak Evidence (Small adjustments):**
- Air Canada A350 orders for 2030+: Shows long-term confidence but irrelevant to Feb 2026.
- Turkish Airlines 500th aircraft celebration: Positive sentiment but no delivery impact.
- Stock price movements: Reflect expectations already priced in.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** February 2026 - approximately 14 days from now (Feb 14 to Mar 1 resolution).

**Critical Consideration:** With only 2 weeks remaining in February, most deliveries that will occur are already in final assembly or flight testing. The constraint is not production starts but completions, particularly awaiting engines and final components.

**If timeframe halved (1 week):** Would predict lower, as insufficient time for monthly ramp-up pattern to materialize.

**If timeframe doubled (1 month into March):** Would predict higher, as March historically shows continued Q1 ramp-up and more time for engine deliveries to arrive.

**Key Insight:** The short timeframe means the outcome is largely predetermined by aircraft already in final stages. Engine constraints affecting January will largely persist through February given supplier lead times.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside View Baseline:** 10th: 20, Median: ~31, 90th: 42

**Factors Supporting Upward Adjustment:**
1. Normal intra-quarter ramp-up: February typically exceeds January (Feb 2023 = 46 vs implied Jan 2023 lower)
2. Backlog exists: 8,754 aircraft ordered, demand not the issue
3. 2025 monthly average of 66 shows capacity exists when unconstrained

**Factors Supporting Downward Adjustment:**
1. **January 2026 = 19 is unprecedented low for decade start** (Strong evidence): This signals binding constraints worse than any recent period
2. **Engine supply explicitly identified as bottleneck by multiple sources** (Strong evidence): Safran/CFM won't increase beyond commitments, Pratt & Whitney in dispute
3. **Deteriorating trend**: Jan 2024 (30) → Jan 2025 (26) → Jan 2026 (19) shows worsening, not improving
4. **Shorter month**: 28 vs 31 days = 10% fewer working days
5. **Short timeframe**: Only 14 days means limited ability for situation to improve

**Critical Assessment:** The January 2026 figure of 19 is not a seasonal anomaly but a structural constraint signal. The engine bottleneck is explicitly documented and won't resolve in 2 weeks. While February historically exceeds January, the current constraint environment is more severe than 2023.

**Adjustment Rationale:** The outside view's central estimate of ~30 assumed modest improvement over January. However, the evidence suggests:
- The 19-delivery January reflects a binding constraint that persists
- Engine suppliers explicitly won't increase deliveries short-term
- Historical February patterns (like 2023's 46) came from less constrained environments

**Revised Assessment:** February 2026 will likely show modest improvement over January (perhaps 25-35 range) due to normal monthly progression, but will fall well short of historical February performance or 2025 monthly averages. The constraint is real, documented, and structural.

## Distribution Calibration

**Status Quo Outcome:** If nothing changes from January's constraint level, February would deliver ~19-22 aircraft (accounting for shorter month).

**Trend Continuation:** The deteriorating trend (30→26→19) suggests potential for further decline, but this seems unlikely given Airbus's efforts.

**Most Likely Scenario:** Modest improvement to 28-35 range as:
- Some aircraft awaiting engines in January receive them
- Normal monthly progression occurs
- But structural constraints prevent return to 2025 average levels

**Tail Considerations:**

**Lower tail (10th percentile):** Could be as low as 20-22 if:
- Engine deliveries don't materialize
- Additional supply chain disruptions occur
- Weather/logistics issues compound problems
Setting 10th percentile: 22 (modest improvement over January's 19)

**Upper tail (90th percentile):** Could reach 40-45 if:
- Backlog of nearly-complete aircraft receive engines
- CFM/Pratt & Whitney resolve disputes faster than expected
- Airbus prioritizes February deliveries for quarterly optics
However, Safran CEO's explicit caution suggests this is unlikely.
Setting 90th percentile: 40 (below Feb 2023's 46, acknowledging constraints)

**Central tendency:** 
- 40th percentile: 29 (50% improvement over January)
- 60th percentile: 33 (75% improvement over January, but still half of 2025 average)

**Distribution shape:** Right-skewed with concentration in 25-35 range, reflecting:
- High probability of modest improvement
- Lower probability of breakthrough to 40+
- Floor around 20 due to minimum production flow

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** Number of Airbus commercial aircraft deliveries reported for February 2026 (28-day month), resolved via official Airbus Orders & Deliveries data by March 1, 2026.

2. **Outside view base rate:** 10th: 20, Median: ~31, 90th: 42. My inside view shifts slightly downward (median 30 vs 31) due to stronger evidence of persistent constraints and shorter timeframe limiting recovery potential.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 30; mean ≈ 31. This makes sense: ~60% improvement over January's 19, but only 45% of 2025's monthly average of 66, reflecting persistent but not catastrophic constraints.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence:**
   - January 2026 delivered only 19 aircraft, lowest decade start (factual, multiple sources)
   - Engine supply bottleneck explicitly confirmed by Safran CEO and Airbus CEO (factual, named sources)
   - Deteriorating trend: Jan 2024 (30) → Jan 2025 (26) → Jan 2026 (19) (factual, official data)
   - February 2023 delivered 46, showing month can exceed January significantly (factual, single source)
   - Only 14 days remain, limiting recovery potential (factual, temporal constraint)

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Airbus has a backlog of 20-30 aircraft awaiting only engines, and Pratt & Whitney/CFM resolve their disputes and deliver a surge of engines in the next 2 weeks, enabling 45-50 deliveries. This would push outcome upward and make my forecast look conservative. Probability: ~10%.

6. **Status quo outcome:** If constraints persist exactly as in January (adjusted for 28 vs 31 days), expect ~17-20 deliveries. Given normal monthly progression, modest improvement to 25-30 is more likely than pure status quo. My forecast of median 30 represents reasonable improvement without assuming constraint resolution.

7. **Technicalities:** All values in integer counts, strictly increasing, within 0-150 bounds. Distribution is right-skewed with 10-90 range of 22-40 (18-unit spread), reflecting genuine uncertainty about constraint resolution speed.
