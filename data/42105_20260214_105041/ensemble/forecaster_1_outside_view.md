Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (High Quality):**
1. **Airbus Official Orders & Deliveries Page** (Multiple references, dated April 2024 but containing Jan 2026 data): Reports 19 deliveries in January 2026 to 15 customers. This is the authoritative primary source. Quality: Excellent.

2. **Airbus Press Release** (Jan 2026): Confirms 793 total deliveries in 2025, providing annual context. Quality: Excellent.

3. **AeroTime Article** (Feb 6, 2026): Reports January 2026 had 19 deliveries, the slowest year start this decade. Includes CEO Guillaume Faury's comments on supply chain issues, particularly engine shortages. Quality: Good - reputable aviation news source with named expert opinion.

4. **Simple Flying Article** (Feb 10, 2026): Breaks down January 2026's 19 deliveries by type: 15 A320neo family, 3 A220, 1 A350. Quality: Good - detailed breakdown from aviation news source.

**Agent Report:**
The agent report confirms February 2023 had 46 deliveries and notes that annual spreadsheets exist for 2021-2025 but weren't fully extracted. Reports A220 guidance of 14/month for 2026 and A320 family target of 75/month by 2027. Quality: Good for what it found, but incomplete.

**Key Factual Information:**
- January 2026: 19 deliveries (confirmed by multiple sources)
- 2025 total: 793 deliveries (average ~66/month)
- February 2023: 46 deliveries
- Historical January comparisons: 26 (2025), 30 (2024)
- Supply chain constraints ongoing, particularly engines

**Expert Opinion:**
Guillaume Faury (Airbus CEO) acknowledged "significant supply chain issues" and identified engines as "the trickiest parts to secure during 2024 and 2025."

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **February deliveries 2021-2025**: Most directly relevant but data incomplete (only Feb 2023 = 46 available).

2. **January 2026 as baseline**: 19 deliveries just occurred. Highly relevant as immediate precedent.

3. **Monthly deliveries in 2025**: 793 annual ÷ 12 = ~66 average per month. However, this masks seasonal variation.

4. **Q1 deliveries historically**: First quarter typically slower due to post-holiday ramp-up and winter weather impacts on logistics.

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** Combination of January 2026 actual (19) and historical February patterns, adjusted for known 2026 constraints. February 2023's 46 deliveries suggests February can significantly exceed January, but 2026 faces documented supply chain headwinds worse than 2023.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** February 2026 - approximately 2 weeks from now (question opened Feb 14, resolves March 1).

**Historical Patterns:**
- January 2026: 19 deliveries (slowest decade start)
- January 2025: 26 deliveries → February 2025: unknown
- January 2024: 30 deliveries → February 2024: unknown
- February 2023: 46 deliveries (2.4x higher than Jan 2026)

**Seasonal Considerations:**
- Q1 typically shows ramp-up from January through March
- February is shortest month (28 days in 2026) vs 31 in January - roughly 10% fewer working days
- However, production lines typically accelerate after January holiday effects

## (d) Justification

The outside view prediction must balance several factors:

**Upward Pressures:**
1. Historical pattern: February 2023 (46) was substantially higher than January 2026 (19)
2. Normal monthly ramp-up within quarters
3. 2025 average was ~66/month, suggesting capacity exists
4. Backlog of 8,754 aircraft indicates demand isn't the constraint

**Downward Pressures:**
1. January 2026 (19) was the slowest decade start, indicating severe current constraints
2. CEO explicitly cited ongoing engine supply issues
3. December 2025 guidance was reduced due to supplier quality issues
4. February has ~10% fewer days than January
5. Supply chain issues described as persistent through 2024-2025 and continuing

**Critical Insight:** The 19-delivery January represents a real constraint, not just holiday effects (since it's lower than Jan 2025's 26 and Jan 2024's 30). The supply chain bottlenecks, particularly engines, are binding constraints that won't resolve in one month.

**Base Estimate:** February 2026 will likely exceed January's 19 due to normal monthly progression, but will fall far short of February 2023's 46 due to ongoing constraints. A reasonable central estimate is 25-35 deliveries, representing modest improvement over January while acknowledging persistent bottlenecks.

## Outside View Calibration

**Distribution Considerations:**

1. **Lower Bound Reasoning:** Absolute minimum would be similar to January (19) if constraints worsen. Could theoretically be lower if major disruption occurs, but unlikely. 10th percentile: ~20.

2. **Central Tendency:** Most likely range 25-35, with median around 30. This represents ~50-80% improvement over January while staying well below 2023 levels and 2025 monthly average.

3. **Upper Bound Reasoning:** If supply chains suddenly improved or if there was a backlog of nearly-complete aircraft, could approach 45-50. However, CEO comments suggest this is unlikely. 90th percentile: ~42.

4. **Tail Risk Considerations:** 
   - Downside: Major disruption (strike, supplier failure) could push below 20
   - Upside: Breakthrough in engine deliveries could enable 50+
   - Historical upset rate in aerospace: Moderate - supply chains are complex but predictable

5. **Calibration to Known Distributions:** The 2025 monthly distribution likely had mean ~66 with significant variance. Current constraints suggest we're in a temporary low-delivery regime, perhaps 30-40% below normal capacity.

**Final Calibration:** Setting wide intervals to account for:
- Incomplete historical February data
- Uncertainty about exact nature of supply constraints
- Potential for either resolution or worsening of bottlenecks
- Short timeframe (only 2 weeks) limits additional information

Outside View Calibration:
The distribution should be right-skewed (longer tail upward) because positive surprises (engine deliveries arriving) are more likely than negative surprises given existing low baseline. The 10-90 range of 20-42 represents reasonable uncertainty while centered on modest improvement over January's constrained performance.
