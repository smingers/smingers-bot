Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**Primary/Official Sources:**
1. **Scramble.nl (9 Feb 2026)** - Reports January 2026: 19 deliveries with detailed breakdown. Factual, reliable aviation news site. No February data.
2. **Simple Flying (10 Feb 2026)** - Confirms January 2026: 19 deliveries (15 A320neo family, 3 A220, 1 A350). Factual data matches official figures. Opinion: Boeing "crushes" Airbus - rhetorical framing.
3. **Multiple sources (12-13 Jan 2026)** - Confirm 2025 annual total: 793 deliveries. Official Airbus data. High reliability.

**Supply Chain/Production Context:**
4. **Mexico Business (30 Oct 2025)** - A220 production delays: currently 7-8/month, target 14/month by Dec 2026 (internally 12/month by mid-2026). Nearly 10 A220s removed from 2026 schedule. Moderate reliability - Reuters-sourced.
5. **Safran/CFM (13 Feb 2026)** - CFM cautious about increasing LEAP engine deliveries beyond agreed volumes. Stand-off between Airbus and Pratt & Whitney over engine supply threatens production goals. CEO Olivier Andries quoted directly. Strong evidence of ongoing constraint.
6. **Simple Flying (17 Jan 2026)** - Pratt & Whitney GTF crisis: ~1/3 of A320neo fleet grounded, engine turnaround times 60→300 days. Annual projection: 900-1,044 deliveries for 2026. Mixed factual/speculative.

**Recent Delivery Patterns:**
7. **AskNews articles** - Confirm January 2026 weakness (19 deliveries vs 26 in Jan 2025, 30 in Jan 2024). Multiple sources note "slowest start of the decade."

**Key Expert Opinions:**
- **Airbus CEO Guillaume Faury** (via multiple sources): Acknowledges "complex and dynamic operating environment," supply chain fragility.
- **Safran CEO Olivier Andries**: CFM will not exceed agreed volumes; priority is existing commitments.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong Evidence (large shifts):**
- January 2026 delivered only 19 aircraft - 27% below January 2025 (26) and 37% below January 2024 (30). This is the weakest January in recent years and establishes a very low baseline.
- Ongoing engine supply crisis (Pratt & Whitney GTF, CFM capacity constraints) confirmed by multiple independent sources including manufacturer CEOs. This is a structural constraint unlikely to resolve within weeks.
- Historical pattern: February typically delivers 1.6-2.0× January volume. With Jan-2026 at 19, this suggests Feb-2026 range of 30-38 if pattern holds.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- A220 production delays (10 aircraft removed from 2026 schedule) affect ~10-15% of monthly mix.
- Airbus 2025 target was revised down from 820→790, suggesting persistent production challenges.
- 2026 annual guidance of 900-1,044 implies monthly average of 75-87, but Q1 is historically weakest quarter.

**Weak Evidence:**
- Speculation about "dozens of planes awaiting engines" that could be delivered if bottleneck clears - timing uncertain.
- Turkish Airlines received 500th aircraft (A350) on 12 Feb - single anecdote, minimal impact on monthly total.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

**Prediction timeframe:** 14 days remaining in February 2026 (today is 14 Feb). Resolution occurs ~7-10 March when Airbus publishes monthly data.

**Impact of timeframe:**
- **If halved (7 days):** Would be mid-February - too early to predict with confidence as most deliveries cluster in final week. Would need to weight January pattern more heavily.
- **If doubled (28 days):** Would cover February + early March. March historically shows strong rebound (often 60-80 deliveries), so combined Feb+early-Mar would push prediction significantly higher.

**Current situation:** With 14 days left, approximately 40-60% of February deliveries likely already completed. The January weakness (19 vs historical 26-30) strongly suggests February will also underperform historical norms.

**(d) Justification**

**Outside view base rate:** February 2021-2025 averaged 43 deliveries (range 32-49).

**Factors warranting downward adjustment:**
1. **January 2026 baseline is 27% below recent years** - strongest single indicator. If February maintains similar deficit, expect ~33-35 deliveries (45 × 0.73 = 33).
2. **Structural engine supply constraints** confirmed by manufacturer CEOs - not a temporary blip but ongoing crisis affecting production capacity.
3. **A220 production delays** explicitly removing aircraft from 2026 schedule.

**Factors limiting downward adjustment:**
1. **Historical February rebound pattern** is robust across years - even weak Januaries see 1.5-1.8× multiplier.
2. **End-of-month delivery push** is standard Airbus practice - could partially compensate.
3. **Annual guidance of 900-1,044** suggests Airbus expects to average 75-87/month eventually, though Q1 is weakest.

**Synthesis:** The combination of weak January baseline + confirmed structural constraints justifies shifting the distribution significantly downward from the 43 base rate. However, the historical February rebound pattern prevents an extreme collapse. I estimate a median around 35-37 deliveries, representing both the January weakness and the typical February recovery, but compressed by ongoing supply issues.

**Distribution calibration:**

The outside view centered on 40 with 10th-90th percentile of 25-60. Given the strong evidence of January weakness and structural constraints, I shift the entire distribution downward by approximately 15-20%.

**Revised thinking:**
- **Floor (10th percentile):** Worst case would be if February barely improves on January due to continued engine shortages. Minimum plausible: ~22 (1.15× January).
- **Lower range (20th-40th):** Most likely scenario given evidence - modest February rebound to 28-35 range.
- **Median (50th):** 35 deliveries - represents January weakness (19) with typical 1.8× multiplier, slightly compressed.
- **Upper range (60th-80th):** If some engine bottleneck clears or backlog aircraft delivered: 38-45.
- **Ceiling (90th percentile):** Optimistic scenario where significant catch-up occurs: ~50 (approaching historical February average).

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** Total Airbus commercial aircraft deliveries reported for February 2026 (single month, count units).

2. **Base rate:** February 2021-2025 averaged 43 deliveries, range 32-49. My prediction shifts this downward by ~20% due to January weakness and structural constraints.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 35; mean ≈ 36. This aligns with January 2026 (19) × 1.8 multiplier, compressed by supply constraints. Reasonable given evidence.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - January 2026 delivered only 19 aircraft (27% below recent years) - factually confirmed
   - Engine supply crisis confirmed by Safran CEO and multiple sources - factually confirmed
   - Historical February rebound pattern (1.6-2.0× January) - empirically verified
   - A220 production delays with 10 aircraft removed from 2026 - Reuters-sourced, credible
   - Airbus 2025 revised guidance down 820→790 - official company statement

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Airbus has 30-40 finished aircraft awaiting engines, and a sudden batch of engines arrives mid-February, enabling a delivery surge to 45-50. This would push outcome upward, making my forecast look conservative.

6. **Status quo:** January delivered 19. If absolutely nothing changed, February would also deliver ~19. However, historical pattern shows February always rebounds. My median of 35 represents a moderate rebound constrained by ongoing issues - reasonable middle ground.

7. **Technicalities:** Values strictly increasing, units are counts (no decimals needed), all within 0-150 bounds.
