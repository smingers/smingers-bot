Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Data Sources:**
1. **Airbus Official Orders & Deliveries Page** (multiple references): Most reliable source. Shows January 2026 delivered 19 aircraft to 15 customers. 2025 full year: 793 aircraft. This is the gold standard for historical data.

2. **AeroTime (Feb 6, 2026)**: Credible aviation news source. Confirms January 2026: 19 deliveries (slowest decade start). Provides context: Jan 2025 = 26, Jan 2024 = 30. Quotes Guillaume Faury (Airbus CEO) on supply chain issues, particularly engine shortages.

3. **Simple Flying (Feb 10, 2026)**: Aviation news site. Breaks down January 2026 deliveries by type: 15 A320neo family, 3 A220, 1 A350. Total = 19. Less authoritative than primary sources but consistent.

4. **AFM.aero**: Provides 2025 annual breakdown by family: A220 (93, ~8/month), A320 (607, ~51/month), A330 (36, ~3/month), A350 (57, ~5/month). Useful for understanding product mix.

5. **Agent Report**: Identifies that February 2023 = 46 deliveries. Notes official 2026 guidance: A220 targeting 14/month in 2026; A320 family targeting 75/month by 2027. Acknowledges missing February data for 2021, 2022, 2024, 2025.

**Key Expert Opinion:**
- Guillaume Faury (Airbus CEO): Acknowledged "significant supply chain issues" with engines being "the trickiest parts" in 2024-2025. This is highly relevant as it explains the January 2026 slowdown.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**
1. **February deliveries historically (2021-2025)**: Most direct comparison but data incomplete. Only have Feb 2023 = 46.
2. **January 2026 as baseline**: 19 deliveries, but January is typically slower post-holiday period.
3. **Monthly average from 2025**: 793/12 = 66 deliveries/month average.
4. **Recent monthly pattern (Q4 2025 - Q1 2026)**: Accounts for current supply chain constraints.

**Selected Reference Class:** Recent monthly patterns (2024-2025) with emphasis on Q4 2025/Q1 2026, adjusted for February's typical position in the year. This accounts for:
- Current supply chain constraints (engine shortages)
- Seasonal patterns (February is shorter, typically mid-range)
- The "slowest decade start" context from January 2026

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** February 2026 (currently Feb 14, 2026 - so ~14 days remaining in the month, outcome known by March 1, 2026).

**Historical Patterns:**
- 2025 full year: 793 deliveries (66/month average)
- January 2026: 19 deliveries (significantly below average)
- January 2025: 26 deliveries
- January 2024: 30 deliveries
- February 2023: 46 deliveries

**Monthly Distribution Pattern:**
- Q1 months (Jan-Mar) typically show lower deliveries than Q4 (year-end push)
- February has 28/29 days vs 31 in most months (~10% fewer working days)
- 2025 monthly range likely ~40-80 deliveries based on 793 annual total

**Current Context (Feb 14, 2026):**
- We're halfway through February
- January showed severe underperformance (19 vs historical 26-30)
- CEO confirmed ongoing engine supply constraints
- Supply chain issues from late 2025 appear to persist

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Calculation:**
- 2025 average: 66/month
- Adjusted for February's shorter month: ~62/month
- February 2023 actual: 46 deliveries

**Downward Adjustments:**
1. **January 2026 signal**: 19 deliveries represents a 27-37% decline from recent Januaries, suggesting systemic Q1 2026 issues
2. **Supply chain constraints**: CEO-confirmed engine shortages persist
3. **Sequential pattern**: If January = 19, February unlikely to jump dramatically given supply constraints

**Upward Considerations:**
1. **February typically stronger than January**: Historical pattern suggests recovery
2. **Mid-month timing**: Half the month has passed; some deliveries likely already completed
3. **Company pressure**: After weak January, Airbus may prioritize February completions
4. **February 2023 precedent**: 46 deliveries shows February can be 2-2.5x January levels

**Synthesis:**
Given January's 19 deliveries and persistent supply constraints, February 2026 likely ranges 30-55 deliveries. The lower bound reflects continued constraints; upper bound reflects typical January-to-February improvement and company catch-up efforts. February 2023's 46 provides a reasonable central estimate, but current constraints suggest slightly lower.

## Outside View Calibration

**Distribution Considerations:**
1. **Central tendency**: 35-45 range most likely, anchored to February 2023's 46 but adjusted down for current constraints
2. **Lower tail (10th percentile)**: Must account for scenario where January's problems persist/worsen. January 2026 = 19 sets floor, but February could be similar or slightly worse: ~22-25
3. **Upper tail (90th percentile)**: Optimistic scenario where supply chain suddenly improves and Airbus delivers at 2025 average pace adjusted for February: ~58-62
4. **Uncertainty factors**: 
   - Unknown: How many aircraft are physically ready but awaiting engines?
   - Unknown: Any engine deliveries accelerating in February?
   - Historical upset rate in aerospace: Moderate (supply chains can shift quickly)

**Calibration:**
- 10th percentile: Conservative scenario, minimal improvement over January
- 20-40th: Below-average February reflecting constraints
- 40-60th: Central range around adjusted February 2023 level
- 60-80th: Moderate recovery toward 2025 monthly average
- 90th: Strong recovery scenario
