Analysis:
**1) Target variable / resolution criteria (paraphrase)**
Resolve to the **number of Airbus commercial aircraft deliveries in February 2026 (count)** as reported on Airbus’ official monthly “Orders & Deliveries” data page (or Airbus IR backup).

## (a) Source analysis (quality, date, facts vs opinions)

1) **Airbus official Orders & Deliveries page (primary; implied via multiple summaries)**
- **What it provides (facts):** Definitive monthly deliveries and orders. January 2026 deliveries = **19** (as repeated by multiple outlets).
- **Quality:** Highest; directly resolves the question (but Feb not yet published).
- **Date relevance:** January 2026 data published early Feb; highly relevant for near-term trend.

2) **Scramble.nl (Feb 9, 2026)**
- **Facts:** January 2026 deliveries = **19**, with a detailed customer/type list.
- **Quality:** Good specialist aviation outlet; typically accurate on deliveries tallies; still secondary to Airbus.
- **Opinion:** None material; mostly factual recap.

3) **Simple Flying (Feb 10, 2026; plus Jan 17, 2026 annual projection piece)**
- **Facts:** Repeats January deliveries = **19** and gives mix (A320neo family/A220/A350).
- **Quality:** Medium. Often accurate on headline figures, but less authoritative; use for corroboration only.
- **Opinions:** General sector commentary; treat lightly.

4) **ch-aviation (Jan 2026 orders headline; subscription/promotional page)**
- **Facts:** Mentions **49 orders** in January 2026 (deliveries not discussed in the excerpt).
- **Quality:** Mixed due to limited extracted substance; not directly helpful for Feb deliveries.

5) **Mexico Business (Oct 30, 2025) re: A220 delays**
- **Facts:** Reports A220 rate ~7–8/month, delays vs targets; Reuters-sourced claims about schedule removals.
- **Quality:** Moderate. Relevant to deliveries mix (A220 contribution), but February deliveries are dominated by A320-family so it’s a second-order driver.

6) **MarketScreener / Reuters-style item (Feb 13, 2026): Safran cautious over stepping into Airbus engine dispute**
- **Facts:** CFM (Safran/GE) cautious on delivering beyond agreed volumes; engine supply dispute with Pratt context; Airbus rate increase ambitions but constrained.
- **Quality:** High-moderate (market/Reuters-like). Mechanistically relevant (engines gate deliveries).
- **Opinions:** CEO Olivier Andries commentary—identifiable executive; treat as informed but still strategic.

7) **MarketScreener “4 key events…” (Feb 13, 2026)**
- **Facts:** Notes market focus on Airbus production rate/delivery targets ahead of Feb 19 earnings; consensus financial metrics.
- **Quality:** Moderate; not giving February delivery count, but supports “investors worried about deliveries.”

8) **Other AskNews items (Palantir partnership, defense show, Ariane 6, Lufthansa diversion, Air Canada order, Turkish Airlines milestone, etc.)**
- **Relevance:** Mostly irrelevant to **Feb 2026 commercial deliveries**. Orders and partnerships don’t translate into same-month deliveries.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

**Strong evidence**
- **January 2026 deliveries = 19 (multiple independent sources corroborate Airbus figure).** This is direct, recent operational signal and suggests a weak start to 2026.
- **Engine supply constraints as a structural bottleneck (Pratt & Whitney GTF issues + CFM capacity discipline).** Deliveries require engines; this is hard to “fix” within weeks.

**Moderate evidence**
- **Seasonality / within-year delivery timing:** Airbus tends to deliver fewer in early months, more in Q4. February is typically higher than January, but still “early-year.”
- **A220 production delays:** Could slightly reduce monthly deliveries, but A220 is a minority share of total deliveries.

**Weak evidence**
- **January orders = 49:** Orders don’t map to February deliveries; weak for this resolution.
- **Financial-market commentary and stock moves:** No direct mapping to next-month delivery count.

## (c) Timeframe analysis

- Today is **2026-02-14**. We are forecasting **February 2026** deliveries; the outcome is known when Airbus publishes Feb deliveries (by early March).  
- **Time left:** ~2 weeks of February plus publication lag; very short horizon.
- **If timeframe were halved (forecasting only the next ~1 week):** I’d anchor more heavily to “status quo constraints” and expect limited information flow; distribution would tighten slightly around a low-to-mid February count.
- **If timeframe were doubled (forecasting March too / next ~6 weeks):** I’d allow more potential catch-up deliveries and operational smoothing; upper tail would rise meaningfully.

## (d) Justification: shifting from outside view to inside view

**Outside view base-rate distribution given:**  
P10 24, P20 30, P40 38, P60 45, P80 52, P90 60.

**Why adjust?**
- The outside view already incorporated “weak January + supply constraints,” but **newer inside-view emphasis** is the **Feb 13 engine-supply stance** (Safran/CFM cautious; ongoing Pratt dispute). That leans toward **continued gating** of A320-family deliveries (the bulk of Airbus volume). With only ~2 weeks left in-month, a sudden surge becomes harder.
- Counterweight: **February is usually stronger than January**; Airbus can pull forward some handovers if airframes are ready and paperwork/training slots align. So I do *not* drag the median anywhere near 19; rather I trim modestly and widen a bit.

Net: **slightly lower central tendency than the outside view** (especially around the median), but keep a meaningful upper tail because short-month delivery batching can still happen.

Distribution calibration:
- **Status quo / trend-continued view:** With engines constrained and January at 19, a “some improvement but still constrained” month looks like **mid-to-high 30s / low 40s**.
- **Upside scenario (push deliveries + clearing parked aircraft + smoother handovers):** **~50–60+**.
- **Downside scenario (engine shortfalls worsen; delivery deferrals; paperwork/acceptance delays):** **~low-to-mid 20s**, close to January-like performance.

Checklist:
1) **Paraphrase check:** Forecast is **Airbus commercial aircraft deliveries in Feb 2026 (count)** per Airbus official monthly data.  
2) **Outside view base rate used:** P10/20/40/60/80/90 = **24/30/38/45/52/60**.  
3) **Consistency check:** Implied median ≈ **40–44**; mean ≈ **~42–45**. Seems consistent with “better than Jan (19) but still constrained.”  
4) **Key evidence (3–5 items):**
   - January 2026 deliveries were **19** (strong, repeated across sources).
   - **Engine supply constraints** remain central; CFM cautious and Pratt dispute ongoing (MarketScreener Feb 13).
   - **Early-year seasonality**: Feb typically > Jan, but still below annual average.
   - A220 delays (moderate) slightly reduce total potential.
5) **Blind spot scenario:** Airbus executes an unusually strong end-of-month delivery push (paperwork/engines clear suddenly) → outcome **higher** than forecast.  
6) **Status quo outcome:** “Constraints persist, modest improvement from January” → supports keeping center in low-40s.  
7) **Technicalities:** Percentiles strictly increasing; units are counts; within bounds (0–150).
