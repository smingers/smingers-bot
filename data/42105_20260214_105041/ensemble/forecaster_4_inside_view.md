Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Airbus “Orders & Deliveries” (official, Feb-07 data cut): confirms 19 January 2026 deliveries. Highest-quality, factual.  
2. Scramble.nl (09-Feb-26): repeats the same 19 January figure and gives aircraft-type breakdown. Medium quality, factual.  
3. Simple Flying (10-Feb-26): repeats the 19 figure; adds colour on supply-chain constraints. Medium quality; facts separated from commentary.  
4. MarketScreener / Safran (13-Feb-26): CEO quote confirms engine supply to Airbus will not materially expand in the very short term. Good single-source indication of continued constraint.  
5. FT headline (pay-walled, 11-Feb-26): “Airbus sticks to jet-delivery target despite supply-chain disruptions.” Weak factual content in excerpt, but directionally supports that Airbus does not plan a February surge.  
6. Historical datapoint gathered from AeroTime 2023 (not dated in the news packet but traceable): Feb-2023 deliveries = 46. Only hard February precedent provided.  
All other AskNews hits relate to defence shows, share price moves, etc., and contain no February-delivery information; they are ignored.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Official 19-unit January baseline (reliable, causal for Feb capacity).  
Moderate evidence  
• Historical pattern: Feb deliveries typically ~2–2.3 × January (2021-2023).  
• Safran/Pratt engine bottleneck still unresolved; limits near-term A320-family throughput.  
Weak evidence  
• FT headline optimism; could be PR rather than production reality.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Target date: deliveries made between 1–29 Feb 2026, figure published c. 4 Mar 2026 ⇒ 15 days remain.  
If only 7–8 days were left I would tighten the distribution ~10 %; if 30 days remained I would widen it ~10 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view median (Feb) built around mid-40s.  
Inside view steps:  
1. Scale historical Jan→Feb ratio (2.2) to the fresh 19-unit January ⇒ point estimate ≈ 42.  
2. Supply chain still tight (engine shortage), arguing against an upside “catch-up” spike.  
3. Airbus has no quarter-end pressure in February; March is usually the first mini-push month.  
4. Therefore tilt the whole distribution slightly lower (−3 to −4 units) and widen the low tail a bit.

Checklist:
1. Target: “Number of Airbus commercial aircraft deliveries in Feb 2026” (count).  
2. Base-rate distribution stated; final forecast anchored but modestly shifted downward.  
3. Consistency: median≈44 (interp.), mean≈44–45 – matches reasoning.  
4. Key evidence: a) Jan 2026 = 19; b) historic Feb/Jan ratio ≈2.2; c) ongoing engine shortage; d) no quarter-end push in Feb.  
5. Blind-spot: Airbus frees a tranche of GTF engines mid-month → Feb spike into 70s (would push outcome up).  
6. Status-quo (low-Jan, constrained-supply) biases toward sub-50 outcome; distribution reflects this.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, units = aircraft, within 0–150 bound.
