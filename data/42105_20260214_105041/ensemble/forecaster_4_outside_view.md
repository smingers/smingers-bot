Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Airbus Orders & Deliveries page (multiple captures, Jan-2026 data).  
   • Factual: 19 aircraft delivered in January 2026, 49 gross orders.  
   • Quality: Primary source, numbers are definitive.  
   • Limitation: Gives no information for February 2026.  

2. Airbus press release 19 Jan 2026 (full-year 2025 results preview).  
   • Factual: 2025 deliveries = 793. Historical totals for 2023-25.  
   • Opinion: “Upward trajectory despite complex environment.”  
   • Quality: High (official).  

3. AeroTime 6 Feb 2026.  
   • Factual: Repeats January-2026 deliveries (19) and gives Jan figures for 2024 (30) and 2025 (26). Quotes CEO on supply-chain problems.  
   • Opinion: “Slowest start of the decade.” Author is an aviation journalist; moderate reliability.  

4. SimpleFlying 10 Feb 2026.  
   • Factual: Confirms Jan-2026 breakdown (15 × A320 family, etc.).  
   • Opinion: Boeing “crushes” Airbus—language is rhetorical. Figures for Airbus match official data; otherwise mostly commentary.  

5. Agent report (retrieval of 2021-25 spreadsheets).  
   • Factual: Identifies location of official annual workbooks and extracts one verifiable data point: Feb-2023 deliveries = 46.  
   • Limitation: February counts for the other years are still missing; numbers flagged as “to be read” directly from workbooks.  

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
i. February deliveries 2021-2025 (same month, same company).  
ii. All monthly deliveries 2021-2025 (~60 data points).  
iii. Quarterly deliveries Q1 2021-2025 (15 data points).  

Class (i) is the narrowest but directly matches the month being forecast; it also captures seasonality (January is always low, March high). I therefore choose February 2021-2025 as the primary reference class, supplemented by knowledge of January-2026 (the only 2026 datapoint so far).

Working dataset (February deliveries, using published / best-available numbers)  
2021 ~32* 2022 ~44* 2023 46 2024 ~49* 2025 ~45*  
*asterisk = estimated from annual totals and typical month-to-month pattern; true figures will be within a few units of the estimates once spreadsheets are opened.  

Average ≈ 43; median ≈ 45; min ≈ 32; max ≈ 49.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today: 14 Feb 2026. Outcome known when Airbus posts the Feb-2026 sheet (typically around 7-10 Mar 2026) → ≈ 3 weeks out.  
• Pattern: January is normally the trough (19-30 in the last three years). February rebounds, usually landing 1.5-2.0 × January.  
  - Ratio examples: 2024 (49/30 ≈1.6), 2025 (45/26 ≈1.7), 2023 (46/20 ≈2.3).  
• January-2026 is 19, i.e. 27 % below Jan-2025. If the usual 1.6-1.8 multiplier holds, February-2026 would fall in the 30-35 range.  

(d) Justification  
Base-rate centre: 43–45 (five-year February mean/median).  
Adjustments:  
• Negative: January-2026 was markedly weaker; CEO and suppliers cite continuing engine shortages.  
• Positive: Airbus often performs “end-of-month” delivery pushes and had “dozens of planes awaiting engines” in late-2025; any resolution of those bottlenecks could bump February back toward historical norms.  
Combining these, I lean to a mean around 40 with a moderately fat lower tail (chance the troubles persist) and a slimmer upper tail (chance of catch-up surge).  

Outside view calibration:

Chosen distribution: Discrete count of aircraft.  
Anchors:  
- Mean ≈ 40  
- Historical 32–49 range gives a 5-year 80 % interval ≈ 34-48. I widen both tails to account for 2026-specific uncertainty (unknown unknowns, e.g., labour strikes, sudden engine deliveries).  

Tail risk considerations:  
• Upside > 60: only possible if a backlog of ~25 finished aircraft suddenly receives engines—low but non-zero.  
• Downside < 25: would require multiplier on January of ≈1.3 or a mid-month production stop—also low but plausible.  
I assign ≈10 % combined probability to these extremes.  

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 25  
Percentile 20: 30  
Percentile 40: 37  
Percentile 60: 44  
Percentile 80: 52  
Percentile 90: 60
