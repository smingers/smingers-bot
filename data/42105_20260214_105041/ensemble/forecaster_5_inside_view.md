Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
1. Airbus Orders & Deliveries spreadsheet (posted 07 Feb 2026, covers January) – first-party, numbers for deliveries = 19. Very high factual reliability, no opinions.  
2. Scramble.nl 09 Feb 2026 – secondary but cites Airbus data, repeats the 19 figure and gives aircraft-type mix. Good factual quality.  
3. Simple Flying 10 Feb 2026 – secondary, confirms the 19 January deliveries and type mix; commentary on Airbus vs Boeing is opinion.  
4. Marketscreener / Reuters items 13 Feb 2026 – quotes Safran CEO on engine-supply caution; reliable named source, indicates continuing supply-chain friction (moderate evidence).  
5. FT headline (undated snippet) – claims Airbus “sticks to jet-delivery target”; pay-walled, weak because details are missing.  
6. Annual 2025 delivery press releases (12-13 Jan 2026) – first-party, show 793 jets delivered in 2025; provides structural benchmark.  
No February-2026 delivery leaks are visible; hence the only hard data for 2026 so far are January’s 19 deliveries and qualitative supply-chain commentary.

b) Evidence analysis (relative to February deliveries)  
Strong:  
• Historical February delivery counts 2021-25 (32, 49, 46, 46, 48) – narrow band, strong predictive power.  
Moderate:  
• January 2026 deliveries = 19 (lowest Jan since 2021) – suggests capacity constraints persisting into Q1.  
• Engine-supply tension (Safran vs Pratt) – may cap short-term hand-overs.  
Weak:  
• Journalistic projection of 900-1,044 deliveries for full-year 2026 – long-term target, not month-specific.  
• FT headline that Airbus “sticks to target” – vague.

c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome known in ~24 days (Airbus normally posts Feb data 8–11 Mar). If the horizon were halved (≈12 days) my uncertainty would not change: nearly all February airframes are already built; only paperwork could slide a handful into March. If doubled, late-month supply-chain shocks would still mainly affect March onward, so uncertainty would rise only slightly.

d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Base-rate (outside view) median 45, 80% range 32-60.  
Key inside factors:  
• January 2026 was 19, giving a Feb/Jan ratio reference. The five-year average ratio is 1.96; applying it yields ≈37.  
• Supply-chain friction (engines) is ongoing, arguing against an out-size rebound.  
• No evidence of an extraordinary push (e.g., new FAL opening early or quarter-end incentives) – February is not a quarter-close.  
• Therefore I nudge the whole distribution ~3 units lower and slightly narrow the upper tail. The lower tail is widened a bit to allow for a one-off engine-shortage dip.

Distribution calibration
Outside view (10/20/40/60/80/90): 32/37/43/48/54/60.  
Inside view after adjustments:  
• Shift centre down 3-4 jets.  
• Keep similar spread but tilt low tail a little further down.  

Checklist:
1. Target variable: count of Airbus commercial aircraft deliveries, February 2026, as per official Orders & Deliveries report.  
2. Base-rate distribution stated above.  
3. Consistency check – implied median 44, mean ~43-44; matches rationale.  
4. Top evidence: (i) Feb history 2021-25 tightly 32-49; (ii) Jan 2026 = 19, weakest Jan; (iii) persistent engine shortages; (iv) Airbus not yet at 75/mo rate.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden paperwork acceleration of December-2025 spill-over frames could lift Feb to >60. Would push outcome up.  
6. Status-quo (recent Februarys ≈46) slightly exceeds my median; I already adjusted downward but not excessively.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, units = aircraft.
