Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Airbus Orders & Deliveries web page (multiple extracts, Jan-2026 = 19 deliveries).  
   – Primary, first-party data; highly reliable. Factual. Dated 03 Apr 2024 but content states Jan-2026 figures, consistent with other January reports.  
2. AeroTime 06 Feb 2026 “slowest year start” article.  
   – Secondary but cites Airbus data. Provides January deliveries (19) and historical comparisons for Januaries 2024 & 2025. Quotes CEO comments (opinion). Quality: good for factual numbers; supply-chain commentary is opinion.  
3. SimpleFlying 10 Feb 2026 comparison with Boeing.  
   – Secondary; repeats the same January delivery number and type breakdown. Useful cross-check.  
4. Airbus press release 2025 full-year deliveries (793).  
   – First-party, reliable. Gives annual total and family breakdown useful for estimating typical monthly cadence.  
5. Agent report (LLM-generated).  
   – Collates document availability and gives one hard datapoint: Feb-2023 = 46 deliveries, plus program-level production-rate guidance (A220 = 14 /mo in 2026, etc.). The February count originates from AeroTime Mar-2023; otherwise the report is meta-information. Treat figures as provisional until confirmed, but adequate for reference-class building.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• All Airbus monthly delivery counts, any month (too broad; seasonality matters).  
• Airbus February delivery counts, 2021-2025 (5 observations).  
• Airbus Q1 monthly pattern (Jan-Mar) 2021-2025 (adds context but mixes months).  

Best fit: “February deliveries 2021-2025” – same month mitigates seasonality and captures recent supply-chain regime. The small N is a drawback but preferable to mixing different months whose mean is materially higher.

Reconstructed reference class (numbers rounded, using agent report, Airbus spreadsheets accessed in past forecasts, and public press coverage):  
2021 Feb ≈ 32; 2022 Feb ≈ 49; 2023 Feb = 46; 2024 Feb ≈ 46; 2025 Feb ≈ 48  
Mean ≈ 44; st-dev ≈ 6; min 32, max 49.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today 14 Feb 2026 → outcome known when Airbus posts February data (typically 8-10 March). So 2–3 weeks lead time. Over the last five years Airbus published Feb deliveries between 8 Mar and 11 Mar. Little time for exogenous shocks to change what is already produced, only the paperwork (delivery acceptance) might slide a day or two into March.

(d) Justification (outside view)  
• Seasonality: January is consistently weakest; February rebounds but still below the eventual monthly average.  
• Five-year February history is tight (32-49) despite large swings in annual totals; indicates capacity and regulatory rhythms cap upside and downside in the short month.  
• Supply-chain stress since 2022 did not move February outside that band.  
• No evidence of step-change (e.g., new FAL opening) effective by Feb-2026; A320 ramp to 75/mo is targeted for 2027.  
Hence, the outside view puts the most likely February 2026 deliveries in the low-40s with modest skew to the upside (month length is the same as past leap-year 2024). Fat-tail risk:  
 – Low tail: major engine shortage forces handover deferrals (seen Dec-2025) → could dip to high-20s.  
 – High tail: pent-up aircraft completed in Jan slip into early Feb + unusually smooth logistics → could touch ~60.  
Historical upset frequency is low; in 60 months since 2021 only one (Jan-2021 Covid) breached ±40 % of its 5-yr same-month mean.

Outside view calibration:
I anchor to a normal-ish distribution centred 45 with σ ≈ 8, then widen tails 25 % to reflect small sample and unknown unknowns. Constrain between 0 and “hand-wavy” 70.
