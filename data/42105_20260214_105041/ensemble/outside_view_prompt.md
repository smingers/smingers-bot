</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve Airbus Orders & Deliveries spreadsheets 2021-2025 and list February delivery counts; include any 2026 production-rate guidance mentioned in recent press releases.
Objective  
– Locate and list the official Airbus “Orders & Deliveries” Excel/PDF workbooks for 2021-2025.  
– Extract the number of commercial-aircraft deliveries in the month of February of each year 2021-2025.  
– Summarise any explicit 2026 production-rate guidance that Airbus has published recently.

1. Availability of source files (2021-2025)  
• The current Orders & Deliveries landing page contains a “Download reports and assets – All documents” section.  The pull-down lists one consolidated workbook for each full year 2021, 2022, 2023, 2024 and 2025, plus individual monthly PDFs for 2026 YTD (source: Orders and deliveries page, 3 April 2024) (source 3).  
• Therefore, the five annual spreadsheets requested by the user are all publicly downloadable from that page.  File names are formatted “Orders and Deliveries 20XX.xlsx” (or .pdf depending on year).  Each file contains a tab for every month, including the February figures that are needed.

2. February delivery counts located so far  
• 2023 – 46 deliveries (source: AeroTime article summarising Airbus’ February 2023 data, 15 Mar 2023) (source 5).  
• The search set did not surface February counts for 2021, 2022, 2024 or 2025.  They will have to be read directly from the annual workbooks noted above.  Until those workbooks are opened, the table of February deliveries is incomplete:

Year | February deliveries  
2021 | — missing —  
2022 | — missing —  
2023 | 46  
2024 | — missing —  
2025 | — missing —

3. 2026 production-rate / delivery guidance found in recent Airbus communications  
• Airbus Q1-2025 results press release, 30 Apr 2025, reiterates programme-level ramp-up targets and gives the only date-specific guidance for 2026:  
  – A220: “monthly … production rate of 14 aircraft in 2026”.  
  – A320 Family: still targeting 75 per month, but milestone year cited is 2027, not 2026.  
  – A350: 10 per month “in 2028”; A330: stabilised at 4 per month (source 8).  
• Mexico Business/Reuters note (30 Oct 2025) confirms Airbus “maintains its official guidance” of 14 × A220 per month in 2026, while warning internal schedules now push the achievement of 14 to the very end of 2026 (source 11).  
• SimpleFlying (12 Jan 2026) says “company aims to increase its monthly deliveries and production even more… assumptions suggest a target of approximately 900 total deliveries for 2026.”  That article is commentary, not a primary Airbus target (source 10).  
• Safran FY-2025 results (13 Feb 2026) references Airbus’ “targeted production capability of 75 A320 Family aircraft per month in 2027” and confirms suppliers are investing to meet that ramp (source 14).  
• No Airbus document in the result set quotes a 2026 company-wide delivery target; guidance remains programme-specific (A220 = 14/mo in 2026).

4. What we can deliver now  
• Confirm that the required spreadsheets exist and where to fetch them (Orders & Deliveries page, all five years available).  
• Provide the only February figure surfaced in open sources (46 deliveries in Feb-2023).  
• Summarise the official 2026 rate guidance presently on record (A220 = 14/mo in 2026; A320 = 75/mo in 2027; no explicit 2026 total-delivery number).

5. Information gaps that remain  
• Exact February delivery counts for 2021, 2022, 2024 and 2025 are still missing.  These numbers almost certainly reside in their respective annual “Orders and Deliveries 20XX” spreadsheets, but those files need to be opened or scraped.  
• If any updated 2026 guidance has been released after February 2026 (e.g., at Airbus FY-2025 results due mid-February 2026) it is not yet captured here.

Recommended next steps / additional searches  
– Open each annual workbook and read the “Deliveries – February” cell, or run a targeted query such as:  
  Airbus February 2024 deliveries (Google)  
  Airbus February 2025 deliveries (Google)  
– Look for the Airbus FY-2025 results press conference transcript expected mid-February 2026, which may include a numeric 2026 delivery target.

Once those four February counts are retrieved, the dataset for 2021-2025 will be complete and ready for the forecasting exercise.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
