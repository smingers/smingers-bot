Analysis:
To estimate how many aircraft Airbus will deliver in February 2026, we need up-to-date information on:  
• Actual deliveries in January 2026 and December 2025 (gives the latest run-rate).  
• Any current production or supply-chain constraints (e.g., Pratt & Whitney GTF inspections, cabin equipment shortages, Spirit AeroSystems fuselage flow).  
• Statements or guidance from Airbus, key suppliers, or aviation analysts about the February/March 2026 delivery cadence and the 2026 full-year target (these often appear in mid-February interviews, earnings calls, or press releases).  
• Observations from airlines awaiting February deliveries (acceptances slipping to March, etc.).  

The most relevant pieces will therefore be very recent news articles, earnings-call transcripts (Airbus FY-2025 results were released 13 Feb 2026), and analyst notes published in the last few days. We will search for:  
1) The official January 2026 Orders & Deliveries PDF (to know the starting point).  
2) News covering Airbus’s 13 Feb 2026 results call, where management normally gives colour on the current month’s delivery pace.  
3) Reports on ongoing engine or cabin-supplier issues that could hinder February hand-overs.
