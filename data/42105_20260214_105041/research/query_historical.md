Analysis:
To forecast Airbus’ February 2026 commercial-aircraft deliveries I need an outside-view baseline of monthly delivery counts. Most useful is the historical pattern of February deliveries (seasonality), recent monthly run-rates (2024-2025), and any production-rate guidance or news about supply-chain constraints entering 2026. Therefore I will search for (a) Airbus’ official “Orders & Deliveries” monthly spreadsheets for past years, (b) press releases or news articles giving January 2026 or late-2025 delivery figures and production targets, and (c) analyses or databases that list monthly deliveries in table form. These sources will let me compute averages, identify trends, and adjust for known ramp-ups like the A320neo rate-increase.
