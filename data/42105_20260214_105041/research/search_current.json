The event highlighted Saudi Arabia\u2019s strategic goal to become a major aerospace and defense industrial hub. Ahmed Al-Ohali, Governor of the General Authority for Military Industries of Saudi Arabia (GAMI), reported that local content in defense production rose from 4% in 2018 to nearly 25% in 2024, with a target of 50% by 2030. The defense sector\u2019s workforce grew from 24,000 to 44,000 employees, with 63% being Saudi nationals. During the show, 73 Memorandums of Understanding (MoUs) and 220 other agreements were signed. Major aerospace firms showcased their products: Airbus displayed two A400M transport aircraft, Boeing promoted the F-15EX, and Lockheed Martin featured the F-35 in a flying display. The F-35\u2019s potential acquisition by Saudi Arabia, approved by the Trump administration, was a key focus. The event also included static displays of 63 aircraft, simulators for the F-15EX, and a strong presence of drones and UAVs from countries including South Africa and Ukraine, reflecting the growing importance of unmanned systems following the war in Ukraine. The organizers announced plans to expand the show for its 2028 edition.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 05:59 PM\nSource:[aerotime.aero](https://www.aerotime.aero/articles/wds-2026-highlights-saudi-drive-towards-becoming-major-player-in-aerospace)\n\n**'Package Delivered': Macron's Irony and Europe's Move That Surprises Elon Musk**\nOn February 12, 2026, the European Space Agency launched the Ariane 6 rocket from French Guiana, successfully placing 32 Amazon LEO satellites into low Earth orbit. This marked the first flight of the Ariane 64 configuration, equipped with four boosters and capable of carrying over 20 tons to low Earth orbit\u2014approximately double the capacity of the Ariane 62. French President Emmanuel Macron celebrated the launch on X (formerly Twitter), writing, 'Amazon, your package has been delivered,' calling the mission a 'French achievement' and 'a European success.' The launch was Amazon's first of 18 pre-booked missions on Ariane 6, part of its Project Kuiper initiative, which aims to deploy over 3,200 satellites to compete with Elon Musk\u2019s Starlink. The Ariane 6, developed by ArianeGroup (a joint venture of Airbus and Safran), has completed four successful missions since overcoming a technical issue during its 2024 debut. Amazon has invested at least $10 billion in Project Kuiper and has secured over 100 launch agreements, including with SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Arianespace. However, due to delays in new-generation launch vehicles, Amazon recently requested the FCC extend its deadline to deploy half of its constellation by 2026 to July 2028 or grant a waiver. On the financial front, Amazon's stock declined 2.25% on February 12, 2026, and dropped another 0.63% in after-hours trading, reflecting weak momentum across short-, medium-, and long-term trends according to Benzinga Pro.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 04:31 PM\nSource:[Benzinga Italy](https://www.benzinga.com/content/50603994/pacco-consegnato-lironia-di-macron-e-la-mossa-delleuropa-che-spiazza-elon-musk)\n\n**Lufthansa Plane with 109 Passengers Makes Emergency Landing in Europe Due to One Passenger's Health Issue**\nOn February 12, 2026, an Lufthansa Airbus A320neo with 109 passengers departed from Naples, Italy, en route to Munich, Germany. During the flight, one passenger became unwell, prompting cabin crew to provide emergency assistance and notify the captain. The flight crew decided to make an unscheduled emergency landing at Klagenfurt Airport in Austria. The passenger was transferred to medical personnel upon landing; their identity and current health status remain unknown. The aircraft resumed its journey and arrived at Munich with 'minimal delay,' according to Lenta.ru. This incident follows a similar event on the same day, when a passenger jet returning from Glasgow, Scotland, to London, UK, aborted its flight shortly after takeoff after transmitting emergency code 7700.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 03:14 PM\nSource:[Lenta.ru](https://lenta.ru/news/2026/02/13/samolet-so-109-passazhirami-na-bortu-ekstrenno-sel-v-evrope-iz-za-odnogo-cheloveka/)\n\n**4 Key Events That Will Be Important This Week**\nFour key economic events are expected to dominate the financial and economic landscape this week, according to Dow Jones Newswires. First, the ZEW Economic Sentiment Index for Germany is projected to rise to 65.0 in February from 59.6 in January, driven by improved industrial order situations in November and December, which boosted investor optimism\u2014evidenced earlier by Sentix's already published index. This event is scheduled for Tuesday, February 17, 2026, at 11:00 CET. Second, investors will closely monitor Airbus's A320 production rate, delivery targets, and expansion plans in Asia, as the company is expected to report a consensus-adjusted EBIT of \u20ac7 billion\u2014meeting its 2025 operational forecast\u2014though its free cash flow before customer financing is forecast at \u20ac4.29 billion, below the \u20ac4.5 billion target. This update is set for Thursday, February 19, 2026, at 06:00 CET. Third, U.S. real GDP growth for the fourth quarter is expected to slow significantly to a year-on-year rate of 1.9%, down from 4.4% in the third quarter, with the level of the same quarter last year surpassed by 1.9% (2.3%). This data will be released on Friday, February 20, 2026, at 14:30 CET. Fourth, the U.S. Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) Deflator is expected to rise 0.3% month-on-month in December, matching November\u2019s 2.8% year-on-year increase. The core PCE inflation (excluding energy and food) is forecast to rise 0.4% monthly and 3.1% annually, up from 2.8% in November, according to Factset.

While CFM is willing to support Airbus if additional engines are needed in 2024, its priority remains fulfilling existing supply commitments. CFM's forecast for a 15% increase in LEAP engine deliveries in 2024 does not include any additional market share expansion. CFM has already secured engine supply agreements with Airbus for 2026. The situation arises amid a stand-off between Airbus and Pratt & Whitney over engine supply, threatening Airbus's production goals. Airbus aims to increase A320neo-family production to 75 aircraft per month by 2027, up from around 60 currently, but has faced delays due to supply chain issues. Airbus reported late deliveries from Pratt & Whitney and has previously cited problems with CFM deliveries. Pratt & Whitney expressed confidence in reaching an agreement, while Airbus declined to comment ahead of its February 19 earnings release.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 08:59 AM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/safran-cautious-over-stepping-into-airbus-engine-dispute-with-pratt-ce7e5ddad881f024)\n\n**New Routes & Stronger Economics: Why Air Canada's A350-1000 Order Is A Game Changer**\nAir Canada has placed a firm order for eight Airbus A350-1000 jets, with options for eight additional aircraft, marking a pivotal step in its long-haul fleet modernization. First deliveries are expected in the second half of 2040. The A350-1000 offers superior range, payload capacity, and lower unit operating costs compared to older widebody aircraft, enabling Air Canada to profitably launch longer, thinner routes, expand seasonal services, and improve cargo economics. According to Mark Galardo, Air Canada\u2019s Executive Vice President and Chief Commercial Officer, the aircraft will allow the airline to enter new international markets\u2014such as Mumbai from Toronto, potential South African destinations, and additional points in Australia\u2014where ultra-long-haul capabilities are essential. The A350-1000 will also replace aging Boeing 777-300ERs and fill gaps left by the Boeing 787\u2019s limitations on ultra-long sectors. The order fits into a broader, staggered fleet expansion plan: 14 Boeing 787-10s will enter service by late 2026, followed by 30 Airbus A321XLRs (with first deliveries imminent), 23 additional Canadian-built A220s, and five leased Boeing 737 MAX aircraft in 2026. All new aircraft will feature Air Canada\u2019s next-generation cabin standard, upgraded connectivity, and advanced in-flight entertainment. The airline\u2019s hub strategy centers on Toronto Pearson (YYZ), a major global hub serving a multicultural population, with Montreal and Vancouver (YVR) supporting North Atlantic and Asia-Pacific connectivity, respectively. The A350-1000\u2019s entry will enhance Air Canada\u2019s ability to target growing demand from diaspora communities in South and East Asia. Despite current absence in the U.S. market, the aircraft\u2019s role is expected to grow as U.S. carriers gradually adopt it.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 10:10 PM\nSource:[Simple Flying](https://simpleflying.com/new-routes-stronger-economics-air-canada-a350-1000-order-game-changer/)\n\n**Air Canada\u2019s Fleet Modernization Continues with A350-1000 Orders for Asia-Pacific Expansion**\nAir Canada is continuing its fleet modernization initiative for long-haul aircraft by ordering at least eight Airbus A350-1000s, which can carry over 350 passengers. According to Mark Galardo, Air Canada\u2019s senior vice president and chief commercial officer, the airline\u2019s existing A330s, delivered as early as 1999, will need to be replaced starting in 2029\u20132030, requiring immediate procurement due to supply chain delays. The A350-1000 will enable Air Canada to fly up to 9,000 nautical miles, offering greater range than the Boeing 787-10 Dreamliner, which can carry about 335 passengers and is also being added to the fleet in 2026. Galardo emphasized that the A350\u2019s extended range will allow Air Canada to launch services to India, a market currently not served, and strengthen its performance in the Asia-Pacific region, where demand is growing. The first deliveries are scheduled from 2030, with options for eight additional A350-1000s. The aircraft offers approximately 25% better fuel efficiency compared to its predecessor. Although the exact order price was not disclosed, the A350-1000\u2019s list price in 2018 was about $336 million USD, though airlines typically receive significant discounts. Air Canada\u2019s stock has declined 1.7% year-to-date on the Toronto Stock Exchange, trading around $19.45 as of February 12, 2026.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 05:01 PM\nSource:[La Presse.ca](https://www.lapresse.ca/affaires/entreprises/2026-02-12/avions-gros-porteurs/la-cure-de-rajeunissement-se-poursuit-chez-air-canada.php)\n\n**Istanbul: 100,000 Employees' Photos Adorn Turkish Airlines' 500th Plane**\nTurkish Airlines unveiled its 500th aircraft, a new Airbus A350 named 'TK Aile' or 'Turkish Airlines Family,' during a ceremony at Istanbul Airport on February 12, 2026. The aircraft's exterior features images of 100,000 current and retired company employees, symbolizing 93 years of collective effort and perseverance. According to CEO Ahmet Bozda\u011f, the fleet expanded from 65 aircraft in 2003 to over 500 by the end of 2025. The airline currently operates flights to 356 destinations across six continents. Bozda\u011f stated that reaching 500 aircraft was a dream 12 years ago, with a future goal of owning a fleet of 1,000 aircraft by 2036.

Lufthansa and Emirates are reportedly interested in the hypothetical A350-2000, pushing for larger wide-body aircraft. In terms of new orders, Airbus secured 49 commitments in January, all focused on single-aisle aircraft\u201448 in total\u2014with one double-aisle A330. IAG placed a significant order for 10 aircraft, including 8 A320neo and 2 A321neo. On February 19, 2026, Airbus will release its financial results for 2025 and provide delivery forecasts for the remainder of 2026.
