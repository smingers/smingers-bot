The article indicates that Airbus publishes monthly reports on their orders and deliveries page, suggesting February 2026 data would be released in a subsequent monthly report.\n\n**Note:** The article date shows \"April 03, 2024\" but the content discusses January 2026 data, which appears to be an inconsistency in the source metadata.\n</QuestionSource>\n"
