Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

**High-quality, recent sources:**

1. **Politpro.eu** (Feb 14, 2026): Aggregated polling data showing CDU 29%, Greens 21.9%, AfD 20%. Projects CDU 38 seats, Greens 28 seats. Greens gained +3.3% momentum over 30 days. Methodology described as weighted average of multiple institutes. High reliability for current polling snapshot.

2. **LVZ/Leipziger Volkszeitung** (Feb 14, 2026): States "the Greens, led by Cem Özdemir, and the CDU, led by Manuel Hagel, are the top contenders" but notes Greens "have lost support." No specific numbers but confirms competitive race. Medium reliability - news summary without detailed polling.

3. **N-tv** (Jan 22, 2026): Infratest dimap poll (Jan 14-20, 1,168 voters): CDU 29%, Greens 23%, AfD 20%. Greens up from 20% in October. Gap narrowed to 6 points, "smallest in over two years." High reliability - named pollster, sample size, dates.

4. **Die Welt** (Jan 22, 2026): Same Infratest dimap poll data. Confirms Greens at 23%, up from 20% in October. Notes only CDU-Green coalition would have majority. High reliability - corroborates N-tv.

5. **SWR** (Oct 16, 2025): Older Infratest dimap poll showing CDU 29% (down 2), AfD 21% (up 2), Greens 20% (unchanged). Notes AfD overtook Greens for second place. Relevant for trend analysis but dated.

6. **Brussels Signal** (Jan 6, 2026): Infratest dimap poll showing CDU 29%, AfD 21%, Greens 20%. Emphasizes Greens "down massively" from 33% in 2021. Medium-high reliability for polling data.

**Key factual observations vs opinions:**
- **Fact**: Multiple polls consistently show CDU leading at 28-29%
- **Fact**: Greens polling between 20-23% (recent trend upward from 20% to 23%)
- **Fact**: Gap narrowed from 9-11 points (October) to 6 points (January)
- **Opinion**: Politpro describes Greens as "Gaining Momentum" - this is interpretation of +3.3% trend
- **Fact**: Seat projections show CDU 38 seats, Greens 28 seats based on proportional system

**Expert/institutional sources:**
- Infratest dimap: Reputable German polling institute, multiple consistent readings
- Statistisches Landesamt: Official election authority (from outside view)
- Political scientist Albrecht von Lucke: Expert opinion on FDP, not directly on Greens vs CDU race

(b) Evidence analysis:

**Strong evidence (large shifts justified):**
1. **Consistent polling showing CDU lead**: Multiple independent polls (Infratest dimap, INSA, Politpro aggregation) all show CDU leading by 6-9 points. This is strong evidence against Greens winning most seats.
2. **Proportional electoral system**: The 2023 reform eliminates constituency bonuses. Seat projections (38 vs 28) directly reflect vote share proportions. This structural factor makes polling margins translate almost perfectly to seat margins.
3. **Historical pattern of polling stability**: German state elections show minimal late movement. With 22 days remaining, 6-point deficits rarely reverse.

**Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):**
1. **Green momentum**: Greens increased from 20% (October) to 23% (January), gaining 3 percentage points over 3 months. This represents +1 point/month trend. If sustained for remaining 22 days, could gain ~0.7 additional points, reaching ~23.7% vs CDU's 29%.
2. **Gap narrowing**: The CDU-Green gap decreased from 9-11 points to 6 points. This suggests some late movement is possible, but momentum would need to accelerate dramatically.
3. **Coalition dynamics**: Only CDU-Green coalition has majority. This might incentivize strategic voting, though unclear which party benefits.

**Weak evidence:**
1. **Cem Özdemir candidacy**: Former Federal Minister brings name recognition, but no evidence this translates to polling gains beyond observed trends.
2. **Kretschmann not running**: Loss of popular incumbent could hurt Greens, but this is already reflected in current polling.
3. **Arson incident** (Feb 14): Suspicious burning object at Özdemir event. Could generate sympathy, but timing (22 days out) and lack of clarity on perpetrator make impact speculative.

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Prediction timeframe**: 22 days until March 8, 2026 election.

**If halved (11 days)**: Would increase probability of status quo (CDU victory) to ~90-92%. Less time for Greens to close 6-point gap; polling would be even more predictive.

**If doubled (44 days)**: Would decrease CDU victory probability to ~75-80%. More time allows for campaign events, momentum shifts, or external shocks. The Greens' recent +3 point gain over 3 months suggests longer timeframes favor them slightly.

**Current 22-day window**: Sits in middle range. Enough time for 1-2 point movement based on recent trends, but insufficient for 6-point reversal absent major event.

(d) Justification:

The outside view established 17% probability for Greens victory based on:
- 6-11 point polling deficit
- Electoral reform eliminating structural advantages
- 22-day timeframe
- Historical upset rates of ~10-15% for such deficits

**Current information shifts:**

**Factors increasing Greens' chances (+):**
1. **Momentum**: Greens gained 3 points (20%→23%) over 3 months, while CDU held steady. This is moderate evidence of a closing trend. If linear, projects to ~24% by election day vs CDU's 29% (5-point gap).
2. **Smaller gap**: Latest polls show 6-point deficit, not 9-11 points. This moves from "very unlikely" to "unlikely but possible" territory.
3. **Recent data**: Most recent aggregated data (Feb 14) shows Greens at 21.9%, suggesting the 23% reading might be high end of range, but confirms they're above 20%.

**Factors decreasing Greens' chances (-):**
1. **Seat projections**: Politpro's seat model (38 vs 28) shows 10-seat gap, requiring Greens to gain ~5 percentage points to tie on seats. This is substantial.
2. **Time constraint**: 22 days is short. Even with momentum, Greens would need acceleration of their trend (from +1 point/month to +3 points/3 weeks).
3. **No evidence of game-changing event**: The arson incident is concerning but unclear in impact. No major policy announcements or scandals affecting either party.

**Net assessment:**
The momentum evidence is moderate-strength and genuine - Greens have closed the gap from 9-11 points to 6 points. However, the remaining deficit is still substantial given the timeframe and proportional system. The trend would need to accelerate significantly.

Adjusting from 17% outside view:
- Momentum/gap narrowing: +5-7 percentage points (now 22-24%)
- But still 6-point deficit with proportional seats: -2 percentage points (20-22%)
- Short timeframe limits further gains: no adjustment

**Inside view prediction: 20-22%**

Probability calibration:

Starting from 17% outside view, the key update is the Greens' demonstrated momentum from 20% to 23% over recent months. This is real evidence of trend movement, not just polling noise. However, several factors prevent large upward adjustment:

1. **Remaining gap**: Even at best recent polling (23%), Greens trail by 6 points
2. **Proportional system**: Vote share translates directly to seats, no structural advantage
3. **Time**: 22 days allows ~0.7 additional points if trend continues, reaching ~23.7% vs 29%
4. **Acceleration needed**: To reach 29%+, Greens need to gain 6+ points in 22 days (vs 3 points in 90 days historically)

The momentum is real but insufficient. A 20-22% probability reflects:
- ~1 in 5 chance of either (a) polling error favoring Greens, (b) late surge exceeding recent trends, or (c) differential turnout
- ~4 in 5 chance CDU maintains lead through election day

This calibration acknowledges the Greens' improved position vs October while recognizing the structural barriers remain formidable.

**Final probability: 21%**

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Greens win most seats (not votes) in Baden-Württemberg Landtag election on March 8, 2026? Resolution based on official seat totals.

2. **Outside view**: 17% base rate established from polling deficits, electoral reform, and historical upset rates. Current prediction (21%) represents modest upward adjustment based on demonstrated momentum.

3. **Consistency check**: "21 out of 100 times, the Greens win the most seats in Baden-Württemberg." This aligns with a scenario where Greens need either 2-3 point polling error in their favor OR acceleration of recent momentum OR favorable turnout differential - plausible but unlikely.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - CDU leads 29% vs Greens 23% in latest polls (factual, high confidence)
   - Greens gained 3 points over 3 months, closing gap from 11 to 6 points (factual, moderate confidence in trend continuation)
   - Proportional system projects CDU 38 seats vs Greens 28 seats (factual, high confidence)
   - 22 days until election limits time for further movement (factual, high confidence)

5. **Blind spot**: Late-breaking scandal affecting CDU or major policy announcement by Greens that accelerates momentum beyond recent trends. Would increase probability to 30-35%. Also, if Green voters have higher turnout than polls suggest (environmental/youth mobilization), could shift 3-4 points.

6. **Status quo**: Current trajectory (CDU maintaining 6-point lead) is most likely outcome. The 21% probability already incorporates modest continued Green momentum. No adjustment needed - volatility is low in final 3 weeks of German state elections.

Probability: 21%
