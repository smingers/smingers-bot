Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

**Statistical Office Baden-Württemberg (Feb 5, 2026)**: Official government source describing the electoral process. High reliability. Provides factual information about the new two-vote system, 120-seat minimum, and March 8, 2026 election date. No polling data or predictions.

**Hungarian Conservative (Jan 1, 2026)**: General political overview article. Contains no relevant information about Baden-Württemberg election. Not useful for this forecast.

**DW.com (Aug 16-17, 2025)**: News roundup focused on AfD nationally. No specific information about Baden-Württemberg Greens. Not directly relevant.

**Polymarket (Feb 11, 2026)**: Prediction market for **second place** (not first). Shows Greens at 69% probability for second place, implying they're expected to finish behind another party (likely CDU). Market volume of $4,149 is modest. This is highly relevant as it suggests forecasters expect Greens to lose first place.

**Morgenpost (Jan 15, 2026)**: News article stating "In polls, the CDU is significantly ahead of the Greens and the AfD." Not attributed to specific polls but presents this as established fact. Suggests CDU-Green coalition role reversal is likely. Moderately reliable but lacks specific data.

**Euronews (Apr 24, 2025)**: Article about Berlin headscarf law. No relevance to Baden-Württemberg election.

**Agent Report**: Comprehensive analysis providing:
- Historical results: Greens won most seats in 2016 (47 seats) and 2021 (58 seats), after finishing second in 2011
- Three recent polls (all showing CDU leading):
  * Infratest dimap (Jan 14-20, 2026): CDU 29%, Greens 23%, AfD 20%
  * INSA (Jan 20-27, 2026): CDU 29%, Greens 21%, AfD 20%
  * Infratest dimap (May 2025): CDU 31%, Greens 20%, AfD 20%
- Electoral reform details: New two-vote system eliminates Greens' constituency advantage, making seat distribution more proportional to vote share

The agent report is the most valuable source, synthesizing official results and multiple polls with methodological details.

(b) Reference class analysis:

**Reference Class 1: Baden-Württemberg Landtag elections (2011-2021)**
- Greens finished 1st in 2 of last 3 elections (2016, 2021)
- Base rate: 67% for Greens winning most seats
- Suitability: Medium. Captures state-specific dynamics but doesn't account for major electoral reform or current polling trends.

**Reference Class 2: German state elections where incumbent largest party seeks re-election**
- Broader pattern across German states
- Suitability: Low. Too general; doesn't capture Baden-Württemberg's unique Green strength or current national trends.

**Reference Class 3: Elections with major electoral system reforms**
- When rules change significantly, historical patterns often break
- Suitability: Medium-High. The 2023 reform fundamentally changes how votes convert to seats.

**Reference Class 4: Recent polling averages for Baden-Württemberg 2026**
- All three polls show CDU leading by 6-11 points
- Consistent pattern across different institutes and time periods
- Suitability: **Highest**. Most direct and recent evidence, accounts for current political environment and voter intentions.

**Chosen reference class**: Recent polling data (Reference Class 4), adjusted for polling accuracy and time remaining.

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Time to election**: 22 days (from Feb 14 to March 8, 2026)

**Historical polling accuracy**: In German state elections, polls taken 3-4 weeks before election day typically have:
- Average error of 2-3 percentage points per party
- Larger parties (CDU, Greens) tend to have smaller errors
- Late momentum shifts are possible but rare when leads exceed 5 points

**Trend analysis**:
- May 2025: CDU +11 over Greens (31% vs 20%)
- January 2026: CDU +6 to +8 over Greens (29% vs 21-23%)
- Trend shows Greens gaining slightly but still trailing significantly

**Electoral reform impact**: The new proportional system means:
- Greens cannot rely on constituency overhangs (won 58/70 in 2021)
- Seat distribution will closely mirror vote share
- A party needs plurality of second votes (Zweitstimme) to win most seats

(d) Justification:

The Greens face significant headwinds to retain their position as largest party:

1. **Consistent polling deficit**: All three recent polls show CDU leading by 6-11 points. This is a substantial and persistent gap.

2. **Electoral system change**: The 2023 reform eliminates the Greens' structural advantage. In 2021, they won 58 seats with 32.6% of votes. Under the new system, their 2021 vote share would have yielded a smaller seat advantage, and they would need to actually win the most votes to win the most seats.

3. **National political environment**: The Greens are in opposition federally after the 2025 federal election, which may reduce their appeal. The CDU is in government nationally, potentially providing momentum.

4. **Time remaining**: With only 22 days until the election, the Greens would need to overcome a 6-8 point deficit. While not impossible, such swings are uncommon in German state elections absent major scandals or events.

5. **Market expectations**: The Polymarket data showing 69% probability of Greens finishing second (not first) aligns with polling data.

6. **Historical context caveat**: The Greens have been strongest party for 10 years and have popular incumbent Minister-President Kretschmann's legacy. However, Kretschmann is not running; Cem Özdemir is the candidate, removing the personal incumbency advantage.

Outside view calibration:

Starting point: If polls show CDU at 29% and Greens at 21-23%, and the electoral system is now proportional, the probability of Greens winning most seats depends on:

1. **Polling error favoring Greens**: Historically, 2-3 point errors are common. For Greens to win, they would need:
   - Polls to underestimate them by ~4 points AND/OR
   - Polls to overestimate CDU by ~4 points
   - Combined 8-point swing needed

2. **Probability of such polling error**: 
   - A 3-point error in one direction: ~30-40% probability
   - A 6-8 point net swing from polling error alone: ~5-10% probability

3. **Late campaign dynamics**:
   - Undecided voters breaking heavily for Greens: Possible but not indicated by trends
   - Major scandal affecting CDU: No evidence of this

4. **Upset rate in German state elections**:
   - When a party leads by 6+ points three weeks out, they win ~85-90% of the time
   - Upsets occur ~10-15% of the time

5. **Tethering to available data**:
   - Polymarket implies ~31% chance Greens win (100% - 69% for second place)
   - But Polymarket volume is low and may not be well-calibrated
   - Polling average suggests 10-15% chance given required swing

6. **Adjustment factors**:
   - Greens have strong ground game in Baden-Württemberg: +2-3%
   - Electoral reform removes their advantage: -2-3%
   - Short timeframe limits comeback potential: -2%
   - Three consistent polls reduce uncertainty: -2%

Integrating these factors: Base probability of 10-15% from polling, adjusted slightly downward for consistency of polling and limited time, yields approximately 12%.
