Analysis:
**1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)**  
Resolves **Yes** if, in the **official final seat totals** for the **8 Mar 2026 Baden‑Württemberg Landtag election**, the **Greens** have **strictly more seats than any other party**.

**2) Outside view base rate (given)**  
Outside view prediction previously established: **12%**.

## (a) Source analysis (quality, what’s factual vs opinion)
1) **Brussels Signal (Jan 6, 2026)**  
- **Factual claim used:** cites an *Infratest dimap* poll for BW: **CDU 29, AfD 21, Greens 20**.  
- **Quality:** secondary reporting; ideologically slanted outlet; polling number is the key usable datum if accurately quoted. Treat as **medium reliability** for the poll figure; low for narrative framing.

2) **PolitPro BW polling trend page (undated/current, viewed Feb 2026)**  
- **Factual claim used:** aggregate trend: **CDU 29, Greens 21.9, AfD 20** plus a **seat projection** (CDU most seats). Notes Greens +3.3 over 30 days.  
- **Quality:** an aggregator/model; methodology described but not a raw poll. **Moderate reliability** as a synthesized indicator; not definitive.

3) **Hungarian Conservative (Jan 1, 2026)**  
- **No relevant factual BW content.**  
- **Quality:** irrelevant for this question.

4) **DW live page (date unclear in summary; content references a YouGov poll Jan 14–22)**  
- **Factual claim used:** AfD at **~20%**, CDU leads, Greens second (no exact shares given here). Also reports a **YouGov** poll about willingness to cooperate with AfD.  
- **Quality:** DW is high-quality journalism; the AfD-cooperation poll is tangential to “most seats.” **Moderate relevance**, **high reliability** for what it actually reports.

5) **Europeanconservative (Dec 31, 2025)**  
- **Factual-ish claim used:** AfD projected around **21%** in BW.  
- **Quality:** ideologically slanted; vague on sources for BW numbers. **Low–moderate reliability**.

6) **DW FDP article (date not crucial; early Jan 2026 context)**  
- **Factual claim used:** FDP weak nationally; BW is FDP heartland; threshold risk discussed by an identified political scientist.  
- **Quality:** DW is strong; still **indirect** for “Greens most seats.” **Moderate reliability, low relevance**.

AskNews items (Feb 9–14, 2026 unless noted):
7) **Merkur/Spiegel/n‑tv/SWR cluster on suspected arson at an Özdemir event (published Feb 14, 2026; incident described as Jan 31, 2024)**  
- **Factual claim used:** authorities investigating suspected politically motivated arson/attack around an event featuring **Cem Özdemir**; no suspect.  
- **Quality:** mainstream outlets; the **timing confusion** (incident in 2024, story revived 2026) limits inference. Potential electoral impact is speculative. **High reliability on investigation existence; low predictive power**.

8) **LVZ overview of 2026 state elections (Feb 14, 2026)**  
- **Factual claim used:** says CDU/Greens are top contenders; Greens lost support; AfD gained.  
- **Quality:** secondary overview; few hard numbers. **Moderate reliability, low specificity**.

9) **AFP profile on Kretschmann legacy (Feb 13, 2026)**  
- **Factual claim used:** Kretschmann stepping down; economic headwinds; Greens risk losing hold without him.  
- **Quality:** AFP is high-quality. Some interpretive language, but the **succession/removal of incumbency advantage** is a key structural point. **High reliability, moderate relevance**.

10) **Pforzheimer Zeitung / ZEIT / n‑tv on Würth predicting FDP demise (Feb 12, 2026)**  
- **Factual claim used:** a notable business figure opines FDP may fail threshold; endorses Hagel/CDU; notes polls show CDU ahead.  
- **Quality:** the **quote** is factual; the **prediction** is opinion. Useful mainly as a signal of elite sentiment, not vote intention. **Weak-to-moderate relevance**.

11) **stuttgarter-nachrichten coalition-calculator/expert survey (Feb 12, 2026)**  
- **Factual claim used:** expert survey suggests CDU–Green policy overlap high; coalition feasibility discussion.  
- **Quality:** interesting but mostly about coalitions, not largest party. **Low relevance**.

12) **n‑tv / Welt on Infratest dimap poll (Jan 22, 2026)**  
- **Factual claim used (strong):** **CDU 29, Greens 23, AfD 20, SPD 8, FDP 5, Linke 7**; MoE ±2–3; only CDU–Green majority scenario.  
- **Quality:** direct poll reporting with sample/method dates. **High reliability and high relevance**.

13) **SWR item (Oct 16, 2025)**  
- **Factual claim used:** Infratest dimap then: CDU 29, AfD 21, Greens 20; plus **Özdemir leads in direct candidate preference (41%)**.  
- **Quality:** strong outlet. Candidate preference is **indirect** for seats. **Moderate relevance**.

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
**Strong evidence (pushes toward “No”)**
- **Multiple polling indicators** (Infratest dimap Jan 2026; PolitPro trend; earlier Infratest references) consistently show **CDU leading Greens by ~6–8 points** (CDU ~29 vs Greens ~22–23).  
  *Mechanism:* with the **more proportional** seat allocation under the new system, being down mid-single digits in vote share makes being largest party unlikely.

- **Structural change + loss of personal incumbency:** Kretschmann stepping down removes a proven vote/seat anchor for Greens; reform reduces constituency-driven seat bonuses.  
  *Mechanism:* fewer paths for Greens to “win seats without winning votes.”

**Moderate evidence (small push toward “Yes,” but limited)**
- **Momentum signal:** PolitPro reports Greens up ~3 points over 30 days; Infratest dimap shows Greens rising (20 → 23).  
  *Mechanism:* late-campaign convergence is possible; if the gap shrinks into the MoE range, upset probability increases.

- **Özdemir personal strength** (direct-preference lead in an earlier poll).  
  *Mechanism:* could modestly lift party vote, but Germany’s state elections are not direct MP elections; effect is uncertain.

**Weak evidence (minimal/ambiguous)**
- **Attack/arson investigation story** around an Özdemir event: could generate sympathy/mobilization—or backlash—but effects are typically small and hard to generalize.  
- **Elite commentary** (Würth) about FDP extinction: may shape tactical voting at margins, but directionally unclear for Greens vs CDU.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time left:** 22 days (Feb 14 → Mar 8, 2026). Very little time for fundamentals to change.  
- **If timeframe were halved (11 days left):** I’d **lower** the probability slightly (less time for a 6–8 point swing), likely by ~2–3 points.  
- **If timeframe were doubled (44 days left):** I’d **raise** it somewhat (more time for convergence and campaign shocks), maybe +3–5 points.

## (d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from 12%)
**Status quo if trends continue:** CDU remains around 29%, Greens around 22–23% ⇒ CDU most seats under proportional allocation ⇒ **No**.

**Paths to “Yes” (Greens most seats):**
1) **Large late swing**: Greens gain ~3–4 points while CDU drops ~3–4 (or similar net swing).  
2) **Polling miss correlated across parties**: systematic underestimation of Greens and overestimation of CDU.  
3) **Fragmentation/threshold effects** that disproportionately reduce CDU’s effective seat share relative to Greens (less likely than it sounds; threshold dropouts usually help the leader).

Given the **consistent CDU lead** across indicators and the **short runway**, I mostly stay near the outside view. However, I move **slightly upward** because (i) there is at least some measurable Greens improvement since late 2025, and (ii) volatility in multi-party settings with thresholds can create larger-than-expected seat shifts—though the new rules dampen constituency surprises.

Net: modest upward adjustment, but still clearly a “No” leaning forecast.

Probability calibration
- Outside view: **12%**  
- Adjustments:
  - Greens’ recent **polling momentum / narrowing gap**: **+3 pp**  
  - Short timeframe + structural disadvantages (proportionality, Kretschmann exit) already in base, but reaffirmed: **~0 to -1 pp** (kept mostly baked-in)  
- **Inside view probability: 15%**

Checklist:
1) **Paraphrase:** Yes if Greens end with strictly the most seats in official final results for BW Landtag election on/after Mar 8, 2026.  
2) **Outside view base rate:** 12%.  
3) **Consistency line:** *15 out of 100 times, the Greens finish with more seats than any other party.*  
4) **Top evidence (≤20 words each):**
   - Infratest dimap Jan 2026: CDU 29 vs Greens 23 (gap ~6).  
   - PolitPro trend: CDU leads; seat projection shows CDU most seats.  
   - New electoral rules more proportional; Greens can’t rely on constituency-seat advantage.  
   - Kretschmann not running; removes incumbency/personal vote anchor.  
5) **Blind spot scenario:** A late campaign shock (CDU scandal or AfD surge triggering strategic anti-CDU voting) collapses CDU lead.  
6) **Status quo outcome:** CDU plurality persists → CDU most seats.

Probability: 15%
