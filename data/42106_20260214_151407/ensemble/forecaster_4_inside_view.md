Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Infratest-dimap poll for SWR/Stuttgarter Zeitung (field Jan 14-20 ’26, n=1,168, MoE ±2-3 pp) – most recent, well-regarded institute. Gives CDU 29 %, Greens 23 %, AfD 20 %. Quality: strong, factual.  
2. PolitPro poll-trend (aggregates five institutes to Feb 12 ’26). CDU 29 %, Greens 21.9 %, AfD 20 %. Seat projection CDU 38, Greens 28. Transparent weighting; quality: moderate to strong.  
3. Brussels Signal summary of same Infratest poll plus older data – adds no new numbers; quality: moderate.  
4. N-tv/DIE WELT articles (Jan 22 ’26) cite and interpret the Infratest poll; quality: good journalism, no new data.  
5. AskNews local pieces (Feb 12-14 ’26) repeat the “CDU leads, Greens second” motif; mostly opinion, quality: weak for numbers.  
6. Popularity item (SWR Oct 16 ’25) – earlier poll showing Özdemir 41 % vs Hagel 17 % in a head-to-head. Quality: older but from same institute; moderate.  
No other source supplies newer statewide polling or official seat counts, so evidence set is consistent: every identifiable poll shows the Greens trailing the CDU by roughly 6-8 pp three weeks before the vote.

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong evidence  
• Two independent, reputable polls (Infratest-dimap & PolitPro aggregate) agree CDU ≈29 %, Greens ≈22-23 % → Greens presently behind.  
Moderate evidence  
• Greens gained 3 pp between Oct ’25 and Jan ’26 Infratest waves → upward momentum.  
• Özdemir personal popularity advantage could translate into late swing.  
Weak evidence  
• Anecdotes about FDP collapse or AfD controversies; effect on CDU/Green relative standing speculative.

Net evidence pulls the probability downward from the outside-view 39 %.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
22 days remain until ballots are cast; final certified seat totals ~34 days away. German state campaigns seldom see >5 pp swing in that window absent scandal. Halving timeframe to 11 days would further harden expectations; I would trim another 3 pp off a Green-first probability. Doubling timeframe (pre-Christmas) would have left ~45 days: I would have assigned 5–6 pp more upside for Greens.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view baseline (leader change + system reform) = 39 %.  
Downward adjustments:  
• Consistent polling deficit (–18 pp).  
• Seat projection under new rules shows CDU +10 over Greens (–5 pp).  
Upward adjustments:  
• Measurable late Green momentum (+3 pp).  
• Highly popular Green lead candidate vs little-known CDU opponent (+4 pp, as under-researched voters may defer to personalities).  
Net inside-view = 23 %.

Probability calibration
I interpret 23 % as: in roughly 23 out of 100 similar elections held under today’s conditions, the Greens would finish with the most seats.

Checklist:  
1. Paraphrase: “By final official results of the 8 Mar 2026 Baden-Württemberg election, will the Greens have strictly more Landtag seats than any other party?”  
2. Outside-view base rate used: 39 %.  
3. Consistency line: “23 out of 100 times, the Greens win the most seats.”  
4. Key evidence (each ≤20 words):  
   • Infratest-dimap Jan ’26: CDU 29 %, Greens 23 %.  
   • PolitPro aggregate Feb ’26: CDU seat lead 38 vs 28.  
   • Greens gained +3 pp since Oct; momentum upward.  
   • Özdemir preferred over Hagel 41 % vs 17 %.  
5. Blind-spot: A late CDU scandal (e.g., corruption or extremist remarks) breaks days before vote, swinging 6 pp to Greens.  
6. Status-quo tilt: Present numbers favour CDU; inertia therefore slightly lowers Green-first probability.

Probability: 23%
