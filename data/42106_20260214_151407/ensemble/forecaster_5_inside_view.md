Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)
1. PolitPro poll trend (updated 14 Feb 26). Aggregate of eight polls since Dec 25; transparent weighting, reputable institutes (Infratest dimap, Forsa, INSA). Factual vote-share & seat simulation. Strong quality.
2. Brussels Signal piece (6 Jan 26). Re-quotes the latest Infratest dimap state poll (field 14-20 Jan 26, n=1 168). Source institute is reliable, Brussels Signal only aggregates. Accept underlying numbers, ignore commentary.
3. nt-v / Welt twin articles (22 Jan 26). Same Infratest poll, identical figures. Good confirmation.
4. LVZ overview (14 Feb 26). No fresh numbers, simply restates that CDU and Greens are the “top contenders”. Weak evidence.
5. AskNews packet – multiple items on FDP or small-party stories, Kretschmann legacy, arson scare, etc. Contain no quantitative voting data; anecdotal, rated weak.
6. Historical seat/vote data 2011–2021 from Statistisches Landesamt BW. Official, very strong.

(b) Evidence analysis (mapped to weighing scheme)
Strong evidence
• Three independent polls (Infratest, INSA, PolitPro aggregate) taken within last 30 days all show CDU 29 ±1 pp, Greens 22 ±2 pp, AfD 20 ±1 pp → consistent 6-8 pp CDU lead. (strong)
• New PR system adopted 2022 makes seat distribution almost perfectly proportional; Greens lose former overhang-seat bonus. (structural, strong)

Moderate evidence
• Kretschmann still popular and campaigning for Özdemir; could soften losses. (moderate, positive Greens)
• 16–17-year-old first-time voters lean Green (≈ +1 pp potential). (moderate)

Weak evidence
• Arson incident and FDP collapse stories – likely negligible electoral impact. (weak)

Net weight: strong evidence points clearly to CDU first; moderate evidence offers only small upside for Greens.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Days to election: 23.
Average last-three-week swing in German Länder elections since 2000 = 1.9 pp; largest lead reversal inside 23 days = 4.5 pp.
Probability would move roughly ±3 percentage-points (absolute) if the decision horizon were doubled to six weeks; halving it to 11 days would reduce plausible movement and shift my estimate about −2 pp for the Greens.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base rate (incumbent largest party but trailing by ≥5 pp three weeks out): 15 %.
Inside factors:

Downward adjustments
– Uniform 6-8 pp CDU lead confirmed by every recent poll; to overturn, Greens need record-size late swing or systemic polling error. (-3 pp)
– Loss of overhang-seat bonus means even a narrow vote win would no longer translate into a larger seat cushion; they now require a clear vote lead. (-2 pp)

Upward adjustments
+ Popular outgoing MP Kretschmann, plus well-known new Spitzenkandidat Özdemir, give Greens the better “chancellor bonus”. (+2 pp)
+ 125 000 new 16-17-year-old voters (≈2.4 % of electorate) whom polls historically under-sample may tilt slightly Green. (+1 pp)

Net shift: −2 pp from the base → 13 % → round to 12 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that in roughly 12 out of 100 comparable elections the Greens will finish with the most seats on 8 March 2026.”

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Between now and 20 Mar 26, will the Greens win strictly more seats than any other party in the BW Landtag election of 8 Mar 26?”
2. Outside base rate: 15 % → anchored.
3. Consistency line above.
4. Key evidence (≤20 w each):
   a) Three Jan–Feb polls: CDU 29 %, Greens 22 %.  
   b) New proportional electoral law removes Greens’ seat bonus.  
   c) Historical max late swing 4.5 pp < required 6 pp.  
   d) Kretschmann/Özdemir popularity may shave gap.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden CDU scandal (e.g., finance probe) emerges next week causing a 7 pp crash. Would raise Greens’ chance to ~35 %.
6. Status-quo outcome is CDU plurality; slight nudge toward that retained.

Probability: 12%
