<Summary source="https://www.euronews.com/2025/04/24/german-greens-push-to-abolish-neutrality-act-allowing-headscarves-for-civil-servants">
# Summary of Article: German Greens seek to end ban on civil servants wearing headscarves

**Key Facts:**

- The Greens party in the Berlin House of Representatives has proposed abolishing the Neutrality Act, a 2005 law that prohibits civil servants (including teachers, police, and judicial officers) from visibly wearing or displaying religious symbols at work.

- The law bans headscarves for Muslim civil servants and yarmulkas for Jewish men, but allows crucifixes.

- In 2015, the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that a general ban on headscarves is not compatible with the constitution, as it disproportionately restricts fundamental rights. The court stated such bans could only be justified if headscarves posed a threat to "school peace" or state neutrality.

- In 2018, Berlin authorities paid approximately €5,200 in compensation to a Muslim teacher who was not hired due to wearing a headscarf, with a labor court deeming this religious discrimination.

- In 2023, the Berlin education administration stopped the "literal application of the Neutrality Act" and began following the Federal Constitutional Court's 2015 ruling.

- The CDU and SPD parties, which agreed on a ruling coalition after February federal elections, are not expected to support changing the law. Their coalition agreement states the Neutrality Act should be reworked "in a court-proof manner" to reflect current Federal Constitutional Court case law.

**Opinions from Named Sources:**

- Green Party politician Tuba Bozkurt told Tagesspiegel newspaper: "Highly qualified women are not allowed to practise their profession because they wear a headscarf. That is a problem," calling it a "de facto professional ban."

**Note:** This article focuses on Berlin state politics and the Neutrality Act debate. It contains limited direct relevance to the Baden-Württemberg Landtag election question, though it does mention Baden-Württemberg in historical context regarding a 2003 court case.

**Date:** January 1, 2026  
**Author:** Joakim Scheffer

## Key Information Relevant to the Question:

This article does not contain any direct information about the Baden-Württemberg Landtag election or Alliance 90/The Greens' prospects in that specific race.

## General Content Overview:

The article discusses five significant elections scheduled for 2026 that could influence geopolitical developments. The piece focuses primarily on three elections:

1. **Hungary (April 2026):** Parliamentary elections where Prime Minister Viktor Orbán's Fidesz–KDNP alliance seeks a fifth consecutive supermajority after 16 years in power. The main challenger is Péter Magyar's Tisza Party, which secured 29.6% in the 2024 European elections. Polling data varies widely between pro-government and pro-opposition institutions, but Orbán is preparing for his tightest race yet.

2. **United States (2026 midterms):** Republicans hold a slim 220-213 House majority. According to Cook Political Report ratings, Republicans hold 187 solid seats compared to Democrats' 177. US GDP grew at 4.3% annualized rate in Q3 2025, exceeding forecasts. Democrats have a narrow lead on generic House ballot polling.

3. **Sweden (September 2026):** Elections following four years of the Tidö Agreement coalition. Opposition Social Democrats lead polls at ~30%, followed by Sweden Democrats at 20-23% and Moderates at ~18%. Aggregated polling shows Red-Green bloc at ~47% vs. Tidö Agreement camp at ~50%.

**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off mid-sentence and does not mention the Baden-Württemberg election or provide information directly relevant to forecasting the Greens' performance in that specific state election.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide: 1) seat totals and vote shares for Alliance 90/The Greens and main rivals in Baden-Württemberg Landtag elections 2011, 2016, 2021; 2) all statewide opinion polls since January 2025 for the 2026 election with sample size and fieldwork dates; 3) summary of Baden-Württemberg’s 2023 electoral-law reform and its projected effect on seat distribution.
Below is a consolidated briefing that answers the three parts of the original request with the material now available, followed by an assessment of what is still missing.

1) Official Baden-Württemberg Landtag results – vote share and seat totals  
(All figures are based on the certified final tallies published by the Statistisches Landesamt BW or identical numbers carried by Spiegel, Wahlrecht.de and the state website.)

a. 27 March 2011 election (15th Landtag; 138 seats)  
• Alliance 90/The Greens: 24.2 % | 36 seats  
• CDU: 39.0 % | 60 seats  
• SPD: 23.1 % | 35 seats  
• FDP/DVP: 5.3 % | 7 seats  
• AfD: not on ballot (founded 2013)  
(Sources: Spiegel 27 Mar 2011; Wahlrecht.de)

b. 13 March 2016 election (16th Landtag; 143 seats)  
• Greens: 30.3 % | 47 seats  
• CDU: 27.0 % | 42 seats  
• AfD: 15.1 % | 23 seats  
• SPD: 12.7 % | 19 seats  
• FDP/DVP: 8.3 % | 12 seats  
(Source: Statistisches Landesamt press release, 14 Mar 2016)

c. 14 March 2021 election (17th Landtag; 154 seats)  
• Greens: 32.6 % | 58 seats  
• CDU: 24.1 % | 42 seats  
• SPD: 11.0 % | 19 seats  
• FDP/DVP: 10.5 % | 18 seats  
• AfD: 9.7 % | 17 seats  
(Source: Amtliches Endergebnis baden-wuerttemberg.de, 1 Apr 2021)

Trend: the Greens moved from 2nd place in 2011 to clear 1st in both 2016 (+5 seats over CDU) and 2021 (+16 seats).

2) State-wide opinion polling for the 8 March 2026 election (fieldwork ≥ Jan 2025)  
Only three publicly released polls have been located so far. Each is listed with institute, commissioner, sample size, and field dates.

• Infratest dimap “Baden-Württemberg-TREND”, commissioned by SWR & Stuttgarter Zeitung  
  – Fieldwork: 14-20 Jan 2026  
  – Sample: 1 168 (686 CATI, 482 CAWI)  
  – Voting intention (Zweitstimme): CDU 29 %, Greens 23 %, AfD 20 %, SPD 8 %, FDP 5 %, Linke 7 %  
  (Source: infratest-dimap.de, Jan 2026 release)

• INSA/“Nius” (previously Schwäbische Zeitung)  
  – Fieldwork: 20-27 Jan 2026  
  – Sample: 1 000 online/telephone  
  – Voting intention: CDU 29 %, Greens 21 %, AfD 20 %, SPD 10 %, FDP 5 %, Linke 7 %  
  (Source: Nussbaum Medien, 29 Jan 2026)

• Infratest dimap “Baden-Württemberg-TREND”, commissioned by SWR & Stuttgarter Zeitung  
  – Fieldwork: 6-12 May 2025 (exact dates not in press summary; month confirmed)  
  – Sample: not stated in secondary report  
  – Voting intention: CDU 31 %, Greens 20 %, AfD 20 %, SPD 10 %, FDP 6 %, Linke 7 %  
  (Source: Goodnews4.de, 15 May 2025, citing SWR press note)

No other institute (Forsa, Forschungsgruppe Wahlen, YouGov, Civey etc.) has published a land-wide Sonntagsfrage since January 2025 in the public domain retrieved so far. The Spiegel+ polling overview (Spiegel 28 Jan 2026) merely reproduces the Infratest values above and offers no additional primary data.

3) 2023 reform of the Baden-Württemberg Landtagswahlrecht and expected seat effects  
(Legal package adopted 26 Apr 2022; first applied 8 Mar 2026)

Core changes  
• Two-vote ballot replaces one-vote system.  
  – Erststimme elects 70 direct seats (one per constituency).  
  – Zweitstimme for a mandatory state-wide party list now determines overall proportional allocation.  
• Minimum of 50 list seats ensures proportional top-up; total Landtag size remains open-ended.  
• Voting age lowered from 18 to 16 (≈ 180-200 000 extra eligible voters).  
• Gender-parity incentives: parties filled top 20 list slots roughly alternately (Greens & SPD fully 50/50; CDU 9/11; FDP 5/15; AfD 2/18).  
• Overhang/compensation rules copied from Bundestag: every overhang mandate triggers full compensatory seats for the other parties.

Projected effects (synthesis of SWR 13 Feb 2026; Staatsanzeiger 19 Jan 2026; FDP press citing Prof. Behnke simulation)  
• Much closer proportionality: parties that sweep constituencies (Greens won 58/70 in 2021) will no longer convert those wins into an extra seat bonus; instead they merely bring more overhangs that are matched for others.  
• Resulting Landtag size is likely to increase beyond the already inflated 154 seats of 2021. A back-projection with 2021 federal-election votes produced 216 seats (Behnke). A similar order of magnitude is plausible if the Greens again dominate direct mandates.  
• Small and mid-size parties (SPD, FDP, Linke, BSW, Freie Wähler) benefit because list seats are guaranteed even if they rarely win constituencies.  
• Greens’ relative advantage therefore shrinks: under the new law their ability to finish first depends mainly on raw Zweitstimmen share, not on constituency geography.  
• Lowering the voting age may add a demographic that leans slightly toward the Greens, partly counterbalancing the loss of the constituency bonus, but magnitude is uncertain (no turnout data yet).

Overall: simulations and expert commentary concur that the reform makes the seat hierarchy track vote shares more tightly; a lead of one or two percentage points can decide who becomes largest party, whereas in 2016/2021 the Greens’ constituency dominance padded their seat margin.

4) Remaining information gaps  

Polling:  
• At least two additional statewide surveys are referenced in media stories (Infratest dimap October 2025; INSA October 2025) but the fieldwork dates, full questionnaires, and sample sizes were not included in the secondary reports.  
• No complete methodological note could yet be retrieved for the May 2025 Infratest poll.  
• It is possible that other institutes (Forsa, Forschungsgruppe Wahlen, YouGov) released polls that are pay-walled or not indexed by generic news search.

Quantitative impact studies:  
• Apart from Behnke’s 216-seat scenario, no full-scale seat simulations (e.g. converting the 2021 Landtag result to the new formula) were located. Such retro-calculations would help gauge how many seats each party would have lost or gained.

If those items are found, they would upgrade the polling chronology to “complete” and allow a more precise modelling of the Greens’ prospects under the new rules. Otherwise, the core of the original query is now covered.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.
