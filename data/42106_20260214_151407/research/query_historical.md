Analysis:
To judge whether the Greens will again come out on top, I need (a) past seat totals and vote shares in Baden-Württemberg (especially 2011, 2016, 2021, when they first became and then stayed the largest party); (b) the most recent polling for the 2026 state election and how far ahead—or behind—the Greens are versus the CDU and AfD; and (c) details of the new 2023 electoral-law reform (introduction of a second vote, levelling seats, lower voting age) that could change seat arithmetic. Those three strands give an outside view of the Greens’ structural advantage and whether it is likely to persist.
