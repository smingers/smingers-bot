The incident occurred on January 31, 2024, during a rally attended by approximately 400 people. The object, described as a plastic tube filled with flammable material, was found by Gr\u00fcnen-Landtagsabgeordnete Cindy Holmberg, who stated it was deliberately placed and 'looked dangerous'. She emphasized that the object was positioned in a way that made accidental placement unlikely and expressed shock that someone would risk igniting a historic building with so many people present. A security officer extinguished the flame immediately. Initially, authorities refrained from labeling it an attack, stating they were investigating all possibilities. However, the Landeskriminalamt (LKA) and the State Security Center are now investigating under suspicion of attempted serious arson with a possible political motive. No threats were reported before the event, and no suspects have been named. A forensic report is underway to assess the potential danger and whether the building could have caught fire. \u00d6zdemir, who learned of the incident afterward, said it deeply affected him, stating that attacks on open political discourse threaten the foundation of democracy.

Current polling data indicate significant shifts in political dynamics. In Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, the Greens, led by Cem \u00d6zdemir, and the CDU, led by Manuel Hagel, are the top contenders to succeed retiring Minister-President Winfried Kretschmann, as the Greens have lost support and the AfD has gained ground. In Rheinland-Pfalz, the SPD\u2019s 35-year rule may end, with the CDU and AfD leading in polls; the current coalition lacks a majority. In Sachsen-Anhalt, the AfD leads in polling, potentially securing an absolute majority, though CDU candidate Sven Schulze has ruled out cooperation with the AfD. In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the SPD faces a crisis, with the AfD leading and the current red-green coalition lacking a majority; Leif-Erik Holm is the AfD\u2019s top candidate. In Berlin, the CDU leads in polls, but no single party has a clear majority; the current CDU-SPD coalition would lose its majority, making a three-party alliance necessary, with a potential return of a red-red-green coalition. The elections are scheduled for March 8, 2026 (Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg), March 22, 2026 (Rheinland-Pfalz), September 6, 2026 (Sachsen-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern), and September 20, 2026 (Berlin).\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 03:02 AM\nSource:[LVZ - Leipziger Volkszeitung](https://www.lvz.de/politik/landtagswahlen-2026-in-deutschland-wie-buergerinnen-und-buerger-waehlen-wuerden-stand-14-02-2026-RKVHGNWDMVFX3BY6CH4CL3RLZI.html)\n\n**Green Statesman: Winfried Kretschmann's Legacy in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg**\nWinfried Kretschmann, the first Green Minister-President of Germany and longest-serving in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, is concluding his tenure ahead of the March 8, 2026 state election. He has announced his decision to step down, stating, 'I am glad I am leaving,' citing the burden of office and poor sleep. Despite his pragmatic approach and long political career\u2014beginning as a founding member of the Green Party in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in 1979 and serving continuously in the Landtag since 1996\u2014he now faces a legacy marked by economic challenges. Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, a hub for the automotive industry, is suffering from a deep crisis, with unemployment rising to levels unseen in nearly two decades and youth unemployment increasing. Kretschmann, known for balancing environmental ideals with economic pragmatism by supporting major auto manufacturers like Mercedes and Porsche, now advocates for longer working hours\u2014echoing conservative leaders such as Friedrich Merz and Markus S\u00f6der. His political journey, from a former communist student to a respected Green pragmatist, reflects a complex legacy. The Greens risk losing their 15-year hold on the Villa Reitzenstein government seat to their CDU coalition partner without his leadership. His personal life, including his Catholic faith, rural roots, and active civic participation, contrasts with traditional CDU narratives, underscoring his unique political identity.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 05:01 AM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/96986CQ)\n\n**The Seven Little Ones: The Underdogs in Stuttgart's 2026 State Election Campaign**\nThe article highlights seven smaller political parties competing in the 2026 Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state election, focusing on their platforms, candidates, and political positioning in Stuttgart. Volt, a pan-European party advocating for a federalized, solution-oriented Europe, is running in all four electoral districts with its four city council members: Celine Hirschka and Tillmann Bollow (I and III), Andreas Lehrfeld (II), and Benjamin Hueber (IV). It formed a coalition with the SPD in the city council since 2024. The ecological-democratic party is now only contesting the inner-city district (I), represented by Dieter Zielke, advocating for climate, nature, and environmental protection, family-friendly policies, and opposition to lobbying donations. The satirical 'Party' (Die Partei), known for humorous slogans like mandatory concrete and conscription at 65, is now only active in districts I and III with Jasper Pannen and Franz-Xaver Lallinger, and holds a three-member group in the city council with Klimaliste and Puls. The Human-Environment-Animal Protection Party (Mensch Umwelt Tierschutz) runs in districts I and II with Moritz Riedacher and Sandra Just, and forms a coalition with S\u00d6S and the Left in the council, promoting animal rights, climate protection, and social justice. The Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), founded in 2025, is known for its pro-Russia stance and criticism of EU sanctions on Russia; it runs in districts II, III, and IV with Ronald Stock, Chedly Seefeld-Sahraoui, and Patrick Moreira Costeira. The Christian-oriented B\u00fcndnis C runs only in district III with Christian Papentin, emphasizing biblical ethics. The conservative-liberal B\u00fcndnis Deutschland, positioning itself as a centrist alternative to CDU/CSU and AfD, campaigns in district IV with Iprahim Tozman, advocating for middle-class support, deregulation, non-ideological energy policy, strong security, and merit-based migration control. The article notes that Volt received 0.9% of votes in Stuttgart in 2021, while Die Partei gained 1.6% in the same year.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 04:57 PM\nSource:[Stuttgarter-Zeitung.de](https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.landtagswahl-baden-wuerttemberg-die-sieben-kleinen-das-sind-die-underdogs-im-stuttgarter-wahlkampf.919a74a7-e7d6-40b6-b63b-82d69711140f.html)\n\n**W\u00fcrth Expects FDP's Demise in Southwest Germany**\nReinhold W\u00fcrth, a 90-year-old former FDP member and billionaire entrepreneur from K\u00fcnzelsau, predicts the complete disappearance of the FDP in both Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and at the federal level, stating he would like to vote for the party but fears his vote would be wasted.

While a potential coalition of Greens, SPD, and Left (71% alignment) or a Red-Green coalition (87%) is not politically viable, a CDU-Green coalition is considered 'only viable out of necessity' due to low internal cohesion and likely prolonged negotiations. The SPD is seen as more aligned with the CDU than the Greens on issues like banning new internal combustion engine vehicle registrations and stricter migration rules, but significant policy conflicts exist in education, where the SPD supports a more expansive state role. The CDU's preference for a coalition without the Greens is attributed to both ideological distance and internal party dynamics. Experts emphasize that coalition feasibility depends not only on policy alignment but also on the desire for cabinet positions and institutional context. The survey, based on expert evaluations across 16 policy areas, has proven reliable in predicting real-world coalitions, such as the 2021 federal 'traffic light' coalition. Despite CDU-AfD policy similarities (noted in 1992 with the Republicans), the AfD is ruled out due to its populist stance and rejection of the political system, a key differentiator from the CDU. The survey also reveals that Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\u2019s regional parties\u2014SPD, Greens, and FDP\u2014are more conservative on economic and social issues than their national counterparts, shifting them rightward and upward on a policy spectrum.

If the election were held today, the CDU would receive 29% of the vote, unchanged from October 2023, while the Greens would reach 23%\u2014up from 20% in the previous poll. The AfD, previously in second place with 21% in October, has dropped to third with 20%, and is classified by the state office for constitutional protection as a right-wing extremist suspect. The SPD has declined to 8% (-2 points), the FDP remains at 5% and barely avoids missing the Landtag threshold, while The Left (Die Linke) could enter the parliament for the first time with 7%. According to the survey, only a renewed CDU-Green coalition under CDU leadership would achieve a majority; a 'Germany coalition' of CDU, SPD, and FDP would lack a majority. The data, collected from 1,168 voters between January 14 and 20, has a margin of error of \u00b12 to 3 percentage points.

The incumbent Minister-President Winfried Kretschmann, from the Greens, will not run for re-election after three terms.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 02:30 PM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/politik/Gruene-holen-in-Baden-Wuerttemberg-auf-AfD-faellt-zurueck-id30271389.html)\n\n**Gr\u00fcne in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg ziehen bei Umfrage an AfD vorbei \u2013 SPD verliert deutlich**\nAccording to a new survey by 'Infratest dimap' conducted for the 'S\u00fcdwestrundfunk' and 'Stuttgarter Zeitung', the Green Party (Gr\u00fcne) in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg has gained significant ground ahead of the upcoming state election, reaching 23% support\u2014just six percentage points behind the CDU, which remains the strongest party with 29%. This marks the smallest gap between the two parties in over two years. The AfD, previously ranked second with 21% in October 2025, has dropped to third place with 20%, while the SPD has declined to 8%\u2014a loss of two percentage points. The FDP holds steady at 5%, barely above the 5% threshold needed for entry into the state parliament. The Left (Die Linke) remains stable at 7%, ensuring their potential entry into the Landtag for the first time. The survey indicates that only one coalition scenario appears viable: a renewal of the current CDU-Green coalition, now led by the CDU. A 'Germany coalition' (CDU, SPD, FDP), which CDU leader Manuel Hagel recently favored over a Green alliance, would lack a majority in the Landtag.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 12:18 PM\nSource:[DIE WELT](https://www.welt.de/politik/deutschland/article69720d4b28aa17d2d28c3276/baden-wuerttemberg-gruene-ziehen-in-umfrage-an-afd-vorbei-spd-verliert-deutlich.html)\n\n**Jung von Matt Launches Campaign for Cem \u00d6zdemir in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Election**\nOn March 8, 2026, a new Landtag will be elected in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, effectively determining the successor to Green Party Minister-President Winfried Kretschmann. The Green Party has nominated former Federal Minister Cem \u00d6zdemir as their top candidate. The campaign for \u00d6zdemir has officially launched, developed by the advertising agency Jung von Matt, which previously managed the Bundestag election campaign for Alliance 90/The Greens and the Hamburg state association\u2019s campaign during the Hamburg Senate elections. The agency\u2019s involvement in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\u2019s campaign was anticipated, and the first campaign visuals were unveiled earlier in the week.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 12, 2026 04:15 PM\nSource:[https://www.horizont.net](https://www.horizont.net/agenturen/nachrichten/wahlwerbung-das-ist-die-kampagne-von-jung-von-matt-fuer-cem-oezdemir-232703)\n\n**Greens and Left Party Intensify Rivalry for Dominance in Germany\u2019s Left-Wing Landscape**\nThe article examines the intensifying competition between the German Left Party (Die Linke) and the Greens (B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen) for dominance within the left-wing political spectrum. Despite the Greens' earlier self-perception as the leading force of the left-center, the Left Party has gained significant ground, rising from 8.8% in the 2021 Bundestag election to nearly 9% in recent polls, closely matching the Greens' stable 11\u201312% support. This shift is attributed to the departure of Sahra Wagenknecht and her BSW party, which allowed the Left Party to consolidate its base. The Left Party has successfully attracted 700,000 former Green voters in February 2025, particularly among younger, progressive, and urban voters\u2014core demographics of the Greens. The article notes that while the Greens have stagnated, the Left Party has gained momentum, especially in key state elections in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Berlin, and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern. Although S\u00f6ren Pellmann, co-leader of the Left Party, denies intentional targeting of the Greens, the rivalry is evident in political confrontations, such as the heated debate over the government\u2019s pension law. The Greens, represented by figures like Franziska Brantner and J\u00fcrgen Audretsch, emphasize stability and reform, insisting that any coalition must negotiate with them, not assume their support. Both parties share a common opponent\u2014the AfD\u2014but now compete directly for the same progressive voter base.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: December 16, 2025 05:17 AM\nSource:[ikz-online.de](https://www.ikz-online.de/politik/article410689799/wie-gruene-und-linke-im-hintergrund-miteinander-ringen.html)\n\n**The Greens Try a Bolder Tone at Their Federal Conference Amid Identity Crisis**\nB\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen are holding their Bundesdelegiertenkonferenz in Hannover amid a period of political decline and internal reevaluation. Since 2021, the party has suffered setbacks including the loss of its role in the federal government, poor electoral results in the European and federal elections, and the departure of prominent leaders Annalena Baerbock and Robert Habeck. At the conference, the party has shifted toward a more confrontational tone, with Fraktionschefin and Bundesvorsitzende Franziska Brantner criticizing the CDU-led 'Merz government' as divisive and calling the party a 'political counter-proposal' to it. Brantner emphasized the need for honesty about reality, advocating for increased immigration, a reformed but secure pension system, and a rejection of intergenerational scapegoating in the current pension debate. She urged members to have courage and hope. Former party leader Katrin Lang, who stepped down a year prior, delivered a widely applauded speech promoting openness, self-confidence, and the courage to articulate convictions, even to those with differing views. Despite a lack of clarity on the party\u2019s future positioning\u2014whether to pursue a left-leaning, reformist path or continue a centrist, governing role\u2014the party remains united on many substantive issues. Membership has slightly increased to nearly 185,000, suggesting resilience. The party faces a critical test in upcoming regional elections in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, Berlin, Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, and Saxony-Anhalt, with 2026 likely determining whether the downward trend continues.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 29, 2025 07:07 AM\nSource:[WEB.DE](https://web.de/magazine/politik/inland/parteitag-hannover-gruene-gegenentwurf-merz-41639482)\n\n**Wehrdienst Debate in Bundestag and AfD's Rise in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Poll**\nThe German Bundestag is debating a proposed lottery system for mandatory military service, initiated by the Union, which would be activated only if insufficient volunteers join the armed forces. Federal Defense Minister Boris Pistorius (SPD) opposes the idea, but the proposal remains on the table as legislation often undergoes changes during parliamentary processes, including expert hearings and further discussions. Coalition parties agree that military service should remain voluntary; however, if voluntary enlistment is inadequate, a two-stage process could be introduced: first, selected individuals would be asked again if they wish to serve, and if that still falls short, a binding lottery could be implemented\u2014though this would require a parliamentary majority. In a new Infratest dimap survey conducted for SWR and Stuttgarter Zeitung, the CDU loses two percentage points to 29%, while the AfD gains two points to reach 21%, marking its highest result ever in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and overtaking the Greens, who remain at 20%. The SPD stays at 10%, the Left at 7%, and the FDP at 5%. The BSW fails to cross the 5% threshold, securing 3%. In a hypothetical direct election of the top candidate, Cem \u00d6zdemir of B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen leads with 41%, while CDU candidate Manuel Hagel trails at 17%.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 16, 2025 11:45 AM\nSource:[swr](https://www.swr.de/swraktuell-radio/info-date-am-mittag-2025-10-16-wehrdienstdebatte-im-bundestag-afd-in-baden-wuerttemberg-aktuell-zweitstaerkste-kraft-100.html)\n\n**Ebersberg Greens Await and Observe: No Immediate Mayoral Candidate**\nThe B\u00fcndnis 90/Die Gr\u00fcnen Ortsverband in Ebersberg presented its list for the 2026 municipal election, choosing not to field a mayoral candidate at this time.
