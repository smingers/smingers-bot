The court stated such bans could only be justified if headscarves posed a threat to \"school peace\" or state neutrality.\n\n- In 2018, Berlin authorities paid approximately \u20ac5,200 in compensation to a Muslim teacher who was not hired due to wearing a headscarf, with a labor court deeming this religious discrimination.\n\n- In 2023, the Berlin education administration stopped the \"literal application of the Neutrality Act\" and began following the Federal Constitutional Court's 2015 ruling.\n\n- The CDU and SPD parties, which agreed on a ruling coalition after February federal elections, are not expected to support changing the law. Their coalition agreement states the Neutrality Act should be reworked \"in a court-proof manner\" to reflect current Federal Constitutional Court case law.\n\n**Opinions from Named Sources:**\n\n- Green Party politician Tuba Bozkurt told Tagesspiegel newspaper: \"Highly qualified women are not allowed to practise their profession because they wear a headscarf. That is a problem,\" calling it a \"de facto professional ban.\"\n\n**Note:** This article focuses on Berlin state politics and the Neutrality Act debate. It contains limited direct relevance to the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Landtag election question, though it does mention Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in historical context regarding a 2003 court case.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.hungarianconservative.com/articles/politics/elections-2026-hungary-us-midterm-sweden-slovenia-germany/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Five Elections to Test Western Balance of Power in 2026\"\n\n**Source:** Hungarian Conservative  \n**Date:** January 1, 2026  \n**Author:** Joakim Scheffer\n\n## Key Information Relevant to the Question:\n\nThis article does not contain any direct information about the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Landtag election or Alliance 90/The Greens' prospects in that specific race.\n\n## General Content Overview:\n\nThe article discusses five significant elections scheduled for 2026 that could influence geopolitical developments. The piece focuses primarily on three elections:\n\n1. **Hungary (April 2026):** Parliamentary elections where Prime Minister Viktor Orb\u00e1n's Fidesz\u2013KDNP alliance seeks a fifth consecutive supermajority after 16 years in power. The main challenger is P\u00e9ter Magyar's Tisza Party, which secured 29.6% in the 2024 European elections. Polling data varies widely between pro-government and pro-opposition institutions, but Orb\u00e1n is preparing for his tightest race yet.\n\n2. **United States (2026 midterms):** Republicans hold a slim 220-213 House majority. According to Cook Political Report ratings, Republicans hold 187 solid seats compared to Democrats' 177. US GDP grew at 4.3% annualized rate in Q3 2025, exceeding forecasts. Democrats have a narrow lead on generic House ballot polling.\n\n3. **Sweden (September 2026):** Elections following four years of the Tid\u00f6 Agreement coalition. Opposition Social Democrats lead polls at ~30%, followed by Sweden Democrats at 20-23% and Moderates at ~18%. Aggregated polling shows Red-Green bloc at ~47% vs. Tid\u00f6 Agreement camp at ~50%.\n\n**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off mid-sentence and does not mention the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg election or provide information directly relevant to forecasting the Greens' performance in that specific state election.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide: 1) seat totals and vote shares for Alliance 90/The Greens and main rivals in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Landtag elections 2011, 2016, 2021; 2) all statewide opinion polls since January 2025 for the 2026 election with sample size and fieldwork dates; 3) summary of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\u2019s 2023 electoral-law reform and its projected effect on seat distribution.\nBelow is a consolidated briefing that answers the three parts of the original request with the material now available, followed by an assessment of what is still missing.\n\n1) Official Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Landtag results \u2013 vote share and seat totals  \n(All figures are based on the certified final tallies published by the Statistisches Landesamt BW or identical numbers carried by Spiegel, Wahlrecht.de and the state website.)\n\na. 27 March 2011 election (15th Landtag; 138 seats)  \n\u2022 Alliance 90/The Greens: 24.2 % | 36 seats  \n\u2022 CDU: 39.0 % | 60 seats  \n\u2022 SPD: 23.1 % | 35 seats  \n\u2022 FDP/DVP: 5.3 % | 7 seats  \n\u2022 AfD: not on ballot (founded 2013)  \n(Sources: Spiegel 27 Mar 2011; Wahlrecht.de)\n\nb. 13 March 2016 election (16th Landtag; 143 seats)  \n\u2022 Greens: 30.3 % | 47 seats  \n\u2022 CDU: 27.0 % | 42 seats  \n\u2022 AfD: 15.1 % | 23 seats  \n\u2022 SPD: 12.7 % | 19 seats  \n\u2022 FDP/DVP: 8.3 % | 12 seats  \n(Source: Statistisches Landesamt press release, 14 Mar 2016)\n\nc. 14 March 2021 election (17th Landtag; 154 seats)  \n\u2022 Greens: 32.6 % | 58 seats  \n\u2022 CDU: 24.1 % | 42 seats  \n\u2022 SPD: 11.0 % | 19 seats  \n\u2022 FDP/DVP: 10.5 % | 18 seats  \n\u2022 AfD: 9.7 % | 17 seats  \n(Source: Amtliches Endergebnis baden-wuerttemberg.de, 1 Apr 2021)\n\nTrend: the Greens moved from 2nd place in 2011 to clear 1st in both 2016 (+5 seats over CDU) and 2021 (+16 seats).\n\n2) State-wide opinion polling for the 8 March 2026 election (fieldwork \u2265 Jan 2025)  \nOnly three publicly released polls have been located so far.

The Spiegel+ polling overview (Spiegel 28 Jan 2026) merely reproduces the Infratest values above and offers no additional primary data.\n\n3) 2023 reform of the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Landtagswahlrecht and expected seat effects  \n(Legal package adopted 26 Apr 2022; first applied 8 Mar 2026)\n\nCore changes  \n\u2022 Two-vote ballot replaces one-vote system.  \n  \u2013 Erststimme elects 70 direct seats (one per constituency).  \n  \u2013 Zweitstimme for a mandatory state-wide party list now determines overall proportional allocation.  \n\u2022 Minimum of 50 list seats ensures proportional top-up; total Landtag size remains open-ended.  \n\u2022 Voting age lowered from 18 to 16 (\u2248 180-200 000 extra eligible voters).  \n\u2022 Gender-parity incentives: parties filled top 20 list slots roughly alternately (Greens & SPD fully 50/50; CDU 9/11; FDP 5/15; AfD 2/18).  \n\u2022 Overhang/compensation rules copied from Bundestag: every overhang mandate triggers full compensatory seats for the other parties.\n\nProjected effects (synthesis of SWR 13 Feb 2026; Staatsanzeiger 19 Jan 2026; FDP press citing Prof. Behnke simulation)  \n\u2022 Much closer proportionality: parties that sweep constituencies (Greens won 58/70 in 2021) will no longer convert those wins into an extra seat bonus; instead they merely bring more overhangs that are matched for others.  \n\u2022 Resulting Landtag size is likely to increase beyond the already inflated 154 seats of 2021. A back-projection with 2021 federal-election votes produced 216 seats (Behnke). A similar order of magnitude is plausible if the Greens again dominate direct mandates.  \n\u2022 Small and mid-size parties (SPD, FDP, Linke, BSW, Freie W\u00e4hler) benefit because list seats are guaranteed even if they rarely win constituencies.  \n\u2022 Greens\u2019 relative advantage therefore shrinks: under the new law their ability to finish first depends mainly on raw Zweitstimmen share, not on constituency geography.  \n\u2022 Lowering the voting age may add a demographic that leans slightly toward the Greens, partly counterbalancing the loss of the constituency bonus, but magnitude is uncertain (no turnout data yet).\n\nOverall: simulations and expert commentary concur that the reform makes the seat hierarchy track vote shares more tightly; a lead of one or two percentage points can decide who becomes largest party, whereas in 2016/2021 the Greens\u2019 constituency dominance padded their seat margin.\n\n4) Remaining information gaps  \n\nPolling:  \n\u2022 At least two additional statewide surveys are referenced in media stories (Infratest dimap October 2025; INSA October 2025) but the fieldwork dates, full questionnaires, and sample sizes were not included in the secondary reports.  \n\u2022 No complete methodological note could yet be retrieved for the May 2025 Infratest poll.  \n\u2022 It is possible that other institutes (Forsa, Forschungsgruppe Wahlen, YouGov) released polls that are pay-walled or not indexed by generic news search.\n\nQuantitative impact studies:  \n\u2022 Apart from Behnke\u2019s 216-seat scenario, no full-scale seat simulations (e.g. converting the 2021 Landtag result to the new formula) were located. Such retro-calculations would help gauge how many seats each party would have lost or gained.\n\nIf those items are found, they would upgrade the polling chronology to \u201ccomplete\u201d and allow a more precise modelling of the Greens\u2019 prospects under the new rules. Otherwise, the core of the original query is now covered.</Agent_report>\n"
