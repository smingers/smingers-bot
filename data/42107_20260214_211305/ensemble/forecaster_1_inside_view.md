Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**High-Quality Official Sources:**
- **Bayerisches Landesamt für Statistik (Jan 23, 2026)**: Reports 10.05 million eligible voters, down 220,000 from 2020. Factual administrative data, highly reliable.
- **Augsburger Allgemeine (Feb 14, 2026)**: Reports 2020 turnout in Augsburg district was 60%. Regional data, reliable local source.
- **Süddeutsche Zeitung (Jan 5, 2026)**: States 2020 Upper Bavaria turnout was 56.7% vs. 81.2% in 2021 federal election. Factual comparison, reliable.

**Survey/Polling Evidence:**
- **GMS poll for Sat.1 Bayern (Dec 23-Jan 5, 2026)**: 49% say they will "definitely vote," 24% "probably will." Based on past patterns, pollster expects ~59% actual turnout. This is **strong evidence** - direct polling with identified methodology and explicit turnout prediction from professional pollster.

**Advocacy/Opinion Sources:**
- **Handelsverband Bayern (Feb 6, 2026)**: Retail association calls for "high voter turnout" - pure advocacy, no predictive value.
- **DGB Regensburg (Jan 8, 2026)**: Union launching mobilization campaign - indicates organized GOTV effort but no quantitative prediction.

**Structural/Policy Changes:**
- **BR24 (Aug 8, 2025)**: Mail-in ballot distribution shortened from 34 to 20 days before election. Green Party politicians claim this could lower turnout; Interior Ministry disputes this. **Moderate evidence** of potential negative effect, though magnitude uncertain and contested.

**Local Implementation Reports:**
- Multiple sources (Pocking, Südlandkreis, etc.) report high demand for postal voting, with some municipalities seeing 25-30% of eligible voters requesting mail ballots. **Weak-to-moderate evidence** suggesting maintained or increased engagement.

**Historical Context:**
- Outside view established 2020 baseline at 58.7% (some sources say 58.8%).
- 2014 was historic low at 54.7%.
- Long-term trend shows decline from 63.5% (2002) with partial 2020 recovery.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **GMS poll predicting ~59% turnout**: Professional polling institute with identified methodology, conducted within 6 weeks of election, explicitly forecasts turnout based on stated intentions and historical conversion rates. This directly addresses the question and comes from a reliable, named source (GMS/Infratest family). Weight: Very high.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Shortened mail-ballot timeline**: Policy change reducing distribution window from 34 to 20 days. Green Party claims potential turnout suppression; Interior Ministry claims no impact. Historical precedent from February 2025 snap federal election suggests 20-day window is workable. Net effect: Likely small negative (-0.5 to -1.5pp) but uncertain. Weight: Moderate.

2. **High postal voting demand**: Multiple municipalities report 25-30% postal voting requests, similar to or slightly above 2020 levels. Suggests maintained engagement despite shorter timeline. Weight: Moderate, counters concern about mail-ballot policy.

3. **Recent high-engagement elections**: 2023 Landtag (73.1%) and 2024 European (65.5%) show elevated political engagement in Bavaria. However, local elections consistently run 10-15pp below these. Spillover effect likely modest (+1-2pp). Weight: Moderate.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Mobilization campaigns**: DGB and other groups organizing GOTV efforts. Standard practice, difficult to quantify impact. Weight: Weak.

2. **Political polarization**: AfD gains mentioned in polling, could mobilize both supporters and opponents. Speculative mechanism. Weight: Weak.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 22 days until March 8, 2026 election.

**If halved (11 days)**: Would increase confidence in current polling snapshot. Late-breaking events less likely to shift turnout significantly. Would narrow distribution slightly.

**If doubled (44 days)**: Would reduce confidence in current polling. More time for mobilization campaigns, weather uncertainty, or political events to shift engagement. Would widen distribution.

At 22 days, we're in the sweet spot where:
- Polling data is quite current and predictive
- Most voters have formed intentions
- But enough time remains for modest shifts from GOTV efforts or unexpected events

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view centered on 59% with 10th-90th range of 56-62.5%.**

**Key factors warranting adjustment:**

1. **GMS poll prediction of ~59%**: This is the single most important piece of evidence. It's not just a base rate extrapolation but actual stated voter intentions converted through historical patterns by professional forecasters. This **strongly confirms** the outside view central estimate rather than shifting it.

2. **Mail-ballot policy change**: The shortened timeline is a structural change not present in the 2020 reference class. However, the impact appears limited based on:
   - High postal voting demand despite shorter window
   - Interior Ministry's February 2025 precedent
   - Only affects postal voters (who were ~60% of 2020 voters in some areas)
   - Net effect: Small downward pressure (-0.5 to -1pp)

3. **Maintained engagement indicators**: Postal voting demand and recent election turnouts suggest engagement hasn't collapsed from 2020 levels. This counters concern about reverting to 2014 lows.

4. **No COVID boost**: 2020 benefited from unusual circumstances. However, the GMS poll already accounts for this by measuring current intentions, not extrapolating 2020 trends.

**Net assessment**: The GMS poll essentially validates the outside view rather than requiring major shifts. The mail-ballot policy creates modest downward pressure. The combination suggests:
- Central tendency: 58.5-59.5% (slightly below outside view's 59% due to mail policy)
- Range: Similar to outside view but slightly compressed given polling confirmation
- Tails: Less extreme than outside view suggested, as current evidence reduces uncertainty

## Distribution Calibration

The GMS poll provides strong anchoring around 59%, but I need to account for:
- Poll uncertainty (±2-3pp is typical)
- Mail-ballot policy effect (-0.5 to -1.5pp)
- Potential mobilization effects (±1pp)
- Historical volatility (2020 surprised by +4pp)

**Central estimate**: 58.5-59% (slightly below outside view due to mail policy, but poll-anchored)

**10th percentile (56%)**: Scenario where:
- Poll understates demobilization
- Mail-ballot policy has larger negative effect
- Approaches but doesn't reach 2014 low (54.7%)
- Probability: ~10%

**20th percentile (57%)**: Modest underperformance vs. poll prediction
- Some mail-ballot suppression effect
- Below 2020 but well above 2014
- Probability: ~10% (cumulative 20%)

**40th percentile (58.2%)**: Slight underperformance
- Poll slightly optimistic or mail policy has ~1pp effect
- Below 2020 level
- Probability: ~20% (cumulative 40%)

**60th percentile (59.2%)**: Poll prediction realized
- Close to 2020 level
- Mail policy effects minimal
- Probability: ~20% (cumulative 60%)

**80th percentile (60.5%)**: Modest overperformance
- Mobilization campaigns effective
- Above 2020 level
- Probability: ~20% (cumulative 80%)

**90th percentile (61.5%)**: Strong mobilization
- GOTV efforts very successful
- Political polarization drives engagement
- Approaching but not reaching 2002-2008 levels
- Probability: ~10% (cumulative 90%)

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Statewide Bavaria Kommunalwahl turnout percentage on March 8, 2026, as published by Bayerisches Landesamt für Statistik by May 1, 2026.

2. **Outside view base rate**: Centered at 59% with 10th-90th range of 56-62.5%. My prediction is tightly anchored to this, with slight compression due to polling confirmation.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 58.7%; mean ≈ 58.8%. This aligns with GMS poll prediction of ~59% and 2020 baseline of 58.7%, accounting for small mail-policy headwind. Makes sense.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - GMS poll (Dec 23-Jan 5) predicts ~59% turnout based on stated intentions
   - 2020 baseline was 58.7%, up from 54.7% in 2014
   - Mail-ballot timeline shortened from 34 to 20 days (potential -0.5 to -1.5pp effect)
   - High postal voting demand (25-30% in some areas) suggests maintained engagement
   - Recent elections show elevated Bavarian political engagement (73.1% Landtag, 65.5% European)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Unexpected political crisis or highly contentious local issue in final 3 weeks drives surge in turnout to 62-63%. Would push outcome UP. Alternatively, severe weather on March 8 suppresses turnout to 55-56%. Would push outcome DOWN.

6. **Status quo outcome**: 2020 turnout was 58.7%. Given 22-day timeframe and polling confirmation, modest stability around this level (58-60%) is most likely. My distribution appropriately centers near status quo.

7. **Technicalities**: Values strictly increasing, in percentage units, within 25-80 bounds. ✓
