Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (Bavarian Statistical Office):**
- **statistik.bayern.de main page**: Administrative information about March 8, 2026 election. No historical data. High quality but limited utility.
- **2020 Press Release (PM076)**: Official data showing 58.8% turnout in 2020, up 4.2pp from 2014. High quality, factual.

**Secondary Sources:**
- **BR24 (2020 results article)**: Confirms 58.8% turnout in 2020, provides context that this was second-lowest in history despite increase. Reliable regional broadcaster, factual reporting.
- **IDW Research Summary (2022)**: Academic study on 2020 elections, notes unusual 10pp turnout increase in runoffs due to mail-in voting during COVID. High quality, but focuses on runoff dynamics rather than first-round turnout.
- **T-Online NRW 2025 article**: About North Rhine-Westphalia elections, not Bavaria. Limited relevance.
- **BR24 Superwahljahr article (Dec 2025)**: Expert Stefan Merz expects AfD gains but provides no turnout predictions. Opinion from identified expert but not focused on turnout.
- **NN.de survey article**: Notes 2020 turnout was "less than 60%" and federal elections exceed 80%. Factual but imprecise.

**Agent Report:**
Provides comprehensive historical series:
- 2002: 63.5%
- 2008: 59.5% (-4.0pp)
- 2014: 54.7% (-4.8pp) - historical low
- 2020: 58.7% (+4.0pp)

Also provides recent comparison elections:
- 2023 Landtag: 73.1%
- 2024 European: 65.5%

The agent cites Landesamt sources through media reports. Quality appears high with consistent cross-referencing. The trend analysis is logical but contains some speculation about 2026.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Bavarian Kommunalwahlen 2002-2020**: Most direct reference class. Shows declining trend from 63.5% to 54.7% (2002-2014), then partial recovery to 58.7% in 2020. Sample size: 4 elections over 18 years.

2. **German local elections broadly**: Could include other states, but Bavaria has distinct political culture and higher baseline participation than some states. Less suitable due to regional variation.

3. **All Bavarian elections (including Landtag, Bundestag, European)**: Too broad - local elections consistently show 10-15pp lower turnout than state/federal elections. Not comparable.

**Selected reference class**: Bavarian Kommunalwahlen 2002-2020 is most suitable, with careful consideration of the trend trajectory.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 22 days from today (Feb 14, 2026) to election day (March 8, 2026).

**Historical pattern analysis:**
- Long-term trend (2002-2014): Steady decline of ~9pp over 12 years
- Recent trend (2014-2020): Recovery of +4pp
- The 2020 increase occurred during unique circumstances (COVID-19, high mail-in voting)
- Recent high-turnout elections (2023 Landtag 73.1%, 2024 European 65.5%) suggest elevated political engagement in Bavaria

**Cyclical considerations:**
- Six-year cycle means 2026 is exactly on schedule
- No indication of special circumstances like 2020 COVID disruption
- Political environment in 2025-26 shows heightened polarization (AfD gains mentioned in sources)

## (d) Justification

**Key factors for outside view:**

1. **Base rate from historical series**: The mean of 2002-2020 is 59.1%, but this obscures the trend. The 2014-2020 period suggests a potential floor around 54-55% with recovery potential.

2. **Trend direction**: After hitting historic low in 2014 (54.7%), 2020 showed recovery (+4pp). The question is whether this represents:
   - Genuine trend reversal (suggesting continued increase toward 60-63%)
   - COVID-specific anomaly (suggesting reversion toward 56-58%)
   - New equilibrium (suggesting stability around 58-59%)

3. **Recent political engagement**: The high turnout in 2023 Landtag (73.1%) and 2024 European (65.5%) elections suggests Bavarian voters are currently more engaged than in 2018-2020 period. This could provide modest spillover (+1-2pp).

4. **Structural factors**: Local elections consistently underperform other election types by 10-15pp. No structural changes suggest this gap will close.

5. **Uncertainty factors**: 
   - AfD mobilization could increase turnout among both supporters and opponents
   - No COVID-related mail-voting boost expected
   - Weather, local issues, and candidate quality are unknowns

**Central estimate reasoning**: Given the 2020 baseline of 58.7%, modest spillover from recent high-engagement elections (+1-2pp), but loss of COVID mail-voting boost (-1pp), a central estimate around 59-60% seems reasonable. However, significant uncertainty exists around whether the 2020 recovery continues or stalls.

## Outside view calibration

**(a) Distribution shape**: This should be a relatively tight distribution around 57-61% given the historical stability, but with tails extending to account for unexpected mobilization or demobilization events.

**(b) Tethering to established distributions**: The 2002-2020 range spans 54.7-63.5%, a 9pp range. Recent elections (2014-2020) span only 54.7-58.7%, a 4pp range. My distribution should reflect that extreme values (below 54% or above 64%) are possible but unlikely.

**(c) Tail calibration**: 
- 10th percentile: Should capture scenario of demobilization below 2020 levels, approaching but not reaching 2014 low. Around 56%.
- 90th percentile: Should capture strong mobilization scenario, approaching but not reaching 2002 levels. Around 62%.

**(d) Upset rate consideration**: Local elections are relatively stable, but the 2020 surprise (+4pp vs. trend) shows that 3-4pp swings are possible. The COVID context was unique, but political polarization could produce similar surprises. This suggests moderately wide intervals.

**Final calibration**: I'll center around 59% with progressive widening toward tails, ensuring the 10th-90th range captures roughly 8pp (56-64%), which accounts for one standard deviation of historical variation plus uncertainty about trend continuation.
