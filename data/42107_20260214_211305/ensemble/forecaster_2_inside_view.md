Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**Historical/Official Sources:**
1. **Bayerisches Landesamt für Statistik (2020)** - Official statistics showing 58.7% turnout in 2020. Highest quality primary source, purely factual.
2. **Agent historical series** - Provides official Landesamt figures: 2002 (63.5%), 2008 (59.5%), 2014 (54.7%), 2020 (58.7%). High quality, factual baseline.

**Current News (February 2026):**
3. **Augsburger Allgemeine (Feb 14, 2026)** - Reports 60% turnout in Landkreis Augsburg in 2020; 62,673 used absentee ballots. Factual local data, reliable regional newspaper.
4. **GMS Poll for Sat.1 Bayern (Jan 5, 2026)** - Survey of 1,006 voters: 49% say "definitely vote," 24% "probably." Expert Stefan Merz estimates actual turnout around 59% based on past patterns where "probably" voters often don't show up. **Strong evidence**: Named expert with clear methodology projecting 59% turnout.
5. **BR24 (Aug 8, 2025)** - Reports shortened mail-in ballot timeline (20 days vs. 34 days previously). Green Party politicians claim this could lower turnout. Interior Ministry disputes this. **Moderate evidence**: Structural change with unclear directional impact.
6. **Multiple sources** - High postal voting demand reported across Bavaria (Südlandkreis, Pocking, Dachau, etc.). Indicates sustained interest in mail-in voting post-pandemic. **Moderate evidence**: Suggests maintained accessibility.
7. **Süddeutsche Zeitung (Jan 5, 2026)** - States Upper Bavaria had 56.7% turnout in 2020 vs. 81.2% in 2021 Bundestagswahl, confirming municipal elections have systematically lower participation. Factual comparison.
8. **Schneckenlohe local data** - 62.8% turnout in 2020 for this small municipality. Anecdotal, not representative of statewide patterns.

**Expert/Institutional Opinions:**
- **Stefan Merz (Infratest dimap)**: Projects 59% turnout based on survey data and historical patterns of stated vs. actual participation. **Identifiable expert, strong credibility**.
- **HBE President Ernst Läuger**: Advocates for high turnout but provides no data. Opinion/advocacy, not predictive.
- **Political parties**: Various mobilization efforts reported but no quantitative impact data.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Stefan Merz projection of 59%**: Expert pollster with named methodology, directly addressing the question. This is the single most relevant piece of current data.
- **Historical pattern**: Four-election series shows turnout oscillating between 54.7%-63.5%, with 2020 at 58.7%. Stable reference class.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Shortened mail-in timeline**: Could marginally reduce turnout by making voting less convenient, but Interior Ministry claims it's manageable. Net effect unclear but likely small (±1-2 pp).
- **High postal voting demand**: Multiple municipalities report strong early interest, suggesting maintained engagement. Counterbalances mail-in timeline concern.
- **Broader political mobilization**: Landtag 2023 (73.1%) and EU 2024 (65.5%) showed elevated participation, possibly creating spillover effects. However, municipal elections historically run 15-20 pp lower.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Local anecdotes** (Schneckenlohe 62.8%, Augsburg 60%): Not representative of statewide patterns.
- **Party mobilization efforts**: Standard practice, unclear marginal impact.
- **U18 digital voting pilot**: Affects youth engagement symbolically but not actual turnout.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

Election is **22 days away** (March 8, 2026). This is very short-term:
- Campaign effects are largely baked in
- Weather on election day becomes relevant factor
- Late-breaking scandals or events could shift ±2-3 pp
- Structural factors (mail-in rules, candidate slates) are fixed

**If timeframe halved (11 days)**: Prediction would narrow slightly around current polling/expert estimates (58-60%), as less time for surprises.

**If timeframe doubled (44 days)**: Would widen uncertainty bands to account for campaign momentum shifts, though municipal elections have limited media coverage compared to state/federal contests.

**(d) Justification for Adjusting Outside View**

**Outside view baseline**: 60% centered, with 10th-90th range of 52-66%.

**Key adjustments:**

1. **Stefan Merz expert projection of 59%**: This is highly credible, recent (Jan 2026), and methodology-based. It aligns almost perfectly with the outside view center and 2020 actual (58.7%). **Confirms rather than shifts baseline**.

2. **Shortened mail-in timeline**: Potential -1 to -2 pp effect, but high early postal voting demand suggests voters are adapting. **Slight downward nudge of -1 pp to mean**.

3. **No pandemic-induced all-postal second round**: 2020's 58.7% included some boost from forced mail-in voting. 2026 returns to normal first-round conditions. **Slight downward pressure**.

4. **Elevated general mobilization**: Recent state/EU elections showed strong turnout, but municipal elections remain structurally lower-salience. **Minimal upward effect (+0.5 pp)**.

**Net adjustment**: Mean shifts from 60% to approximately 59%, tightening slightly around expert consensus. The historical range (54.7%-63.5%) remains relevant, so maintain reasonably wide tails while centering on expert projection.

**Distribution Calibration**

The expert projection of 59% combined with 2020 actual of 58.7% creates strong central tendency. However:
- Historical variance (σ ≈ 3.5 pp) suggests outcomes outside 55-63% are plausible
- Shortened mail-in timeline introduces modest downside risk
- Weather/turnout-day factors could swing ±2 pp
- Very low probability of exceeding 65% (would require unprecedented municipal election enthusiasm)
- Downside limited by strong postal voting infrastructure (floor around 52-53%)

**Calibrated Distribution:**
- Center on 59% (expert projection + 2020 actual)
- 10th percentile: 53% (allows for demobilization from mail-in changes + poor weather)
- 90th percentile: 65% (historical maximum was 63.5% in 2002; 65% allows for small upside surprise)
- Intermediate percentiles spread to reflect moderate uncertainty around central estimate

**Checklist:**

1. **Target variable**: Statewide voter turnout percentage for Bavaria Kommunalwahlen on March 8, 2026, as published by Bayerisches Landesamt für Statistik by May 1, 2026. Units: %.

2. **Outside view base rate**: Centered at 60%, range 52-66% (10th-90th). Final prediction shifts slightly to 59% based on expert consensus.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 59%; mean ≈ 59.5%. This aligns with expert projection (59%), 2020 actual (58.7%), and historical patterns. Makes sense.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - Stefan Merz expert projection: 59% turnout based on Jan 2026 polling
   - 2020 actual turnout: 58.7% under similar conditions
   - Shortened mail-in timeline: modest downside risk of -1 to -2 pp
   - Historical range: 54.7%-63.5% establishes plausible bounds
   - High postal voting demand: suggests maintained engagement

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Unexpectedly poor weather on March 8 combined with mail-in delivery delays could push turnout to 54-55%, making my forecast look overconfident on the downside. Alternatively, a late-breaking scandal mobilizing protest votes could push to 63-64%.

6. **Status quo outcome**: 2020 turnout was 58.7%. Given stable conditions and expert projection of 59%, status quo strongly supports central estimate. Low volatility expected.

7. **Technicalities**: Percentiles strictly increasing, units in %, values within 25-80% bounds (though question allows exceeding bounds).
