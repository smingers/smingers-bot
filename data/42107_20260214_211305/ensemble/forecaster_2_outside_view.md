Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (Bavarian Statistical Office):**
1. **statistik.bayern.de main page**: Administrative information about the March 8, 2026 election. High quality official source but contains no historical turnout data.

2. **2020 Press Release (statistik.bayern.de)**: Reports 58.8% turnout for 2020 elections, up 4.2 pp from 2014. High quality official source with verified data.

3. **Agent Report**: Provides comprehensive historical series:
   - 2002: 63.5%
   - 2008: 59.5% 
   - 2014: 54.7%
   - 2020: 58.7% (slight discrepancy with press release's 58.8%, likely rounding)
   Also includes recent comparison elections: 2023 Landtag (73.1%), 2024 European (65.5%). High quality compilation citing official sources.

**Secondary Sources:**
4. **BR24 (2020 results)**: Confirms 58.8% turnout in 2020, CSU losses, Green gains. Reputable Bavarian public broadcaster, factual reporting.

5. **IDW Study (2022)**: Academic analysis of 2020 second-round turnout increase due to mail-in voting during COVID. Relevant for understanding 2020's unique circumstances but limited predictive value for 2026.

6. **T-Online (NRW 2025)**: Different state (North Rhine-Westphalia), limited relevance to Bavaria.

7. **BR24 Outlook (Dec 2025)**: Expert Stefan Merz expects AfD gains in Bavaria's 2026 local elections. Opinion from identified expert but focuses on party performance, not turnout.

8. **NN.de Survey Article**: Notes 2020 turnout was "less than 60%" vs. federal elections "more than 80%". Confirms general pattern but no new data.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Bavarian Kommunalwahlen historical series (2002-2020)**: Most directly relevant. Shows declining trend from 63.5% (2002) to 54.7% (2014), then partial recovery to 58.7% (2020). N=4 elections over 18 years.

2. **German local elections broadly**: Less suitable due to regional variations in political culture and engagement.

3. **All Bavarian elections (including Landtag, European)**: Too broad - local elections consistently show 10-15 pp lower turnout than state/federal elections.

**Selected Reference Class**: Bavarian Kommunalwahlen 2002-2020 series is most suitable, with careful consideration of the 2020 COVID context.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 22 days from today (Feb 14, 2026) to election day (March 8, 2026).

**Historical Pattern Over 24-Year Period:**
- Long-term declining trend: 63.5% → 59.5% → 54.7% (2002-2014)
- Recent reversal: 54.7% → 58.7% (2014-2020)
- Net change 2002-2020: -4.8 pp decline
- Average six-year change: ±4 pp

**Key Observations:**
1. 2014 represented the historical low (54.7%)
2. 2020's 4 pp increase was influenced by extraordinary COVID circumstances (high mail-in voting, first pandemic election)
3. Recent non-local elections show high engagement: 73.1% (2023 Landtag), 65.5% (2024 European)
4. The gap between local and state elections remains substantial (14+ pp)

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Calculation:**
The four data points (63.5%, 59.5%, 54.7%, 58.7%) yield:
- Mean: 59.1%
- Median: 59.1%
- Recent trend (2014→2020): +4 pp recovery from historic low

**Factors Supporting Higher Turnout (>60%):**
1. Continuation of 2020's upward trajectory
2. Spillover from high recent state/EU election engagement
3. Potential mobilization around national political issues (AfD gains, coalition instability)
4. Six years of potential civic engagement initiatives post-2020

**Factors Supporting Lower/Stable Turnout (55-60%):**
1. 2020's increase may have been COVID-specific (mail-voting convenience)
2. Long-term structural decline in local election participation
3. Local elections inherently generate less interest than state/federal contests
4. Return to "normal" patterns after pandemic disruption

**Most Likely Scenario:**
Given the historical pattern and recent context, turnout will likely fall in the 57-62% range, representing either:
- Modest continuation of 2020 recovery (optimistic: 60-62%)
- Stabilization near 2020 levels (neutral: 58-60%)
- Partial reversion toward long-term mean (cautious: 57-59%)

The 2020 figure of 58.7% serves as a strong anchor, but uncertainty exists about whether that represented a genuine turning point or a COVID anomaly.

## Outside view calibration:

**Distribution Considerations:**

1. **Historical Volatility**: The 24-year range spans 8.8 pp (54.7% to 63.5%). Six-year changes have ranged from -4.8 pp to +4.0 pp.

2. **Tethering to Established Patterns**: 
   - The 2002-2020 series provides a natural distribution
   - 2020's 58.7% is the most recent anchor
   - Historical minimum: 54.7% (2014)
   - Historical maximum: 63.5% (2002)

3. **Tail Considerations**:
   - **Lower tail (10th percentile)**: Must account for possibility of continued decline or reversion below 2020. Historical minimum was 54.7%, but unprecedented factors could push lower. Setting at 55.5% allows for modest decline while respecting historical floor.
   
   - **Upper tail (90th percentile)**: Must account for possibility of strong mobilization continuing 2020's upward trend. Recent state election (73.1%) shows high engagement potential, but local elections never approach that level. The 2002 peak of 63.5% is relevant. Setting at 63.0% allows for exceeding 2020 by ~4 pp (matching the 2014→2020 increase) while staying below historical maximum.

4. **Central Distribution**: Should cluster around 58-60%, reflecting:
   - 2020 baseline (58.7%)
   - Slight upward bias from recent high-engagement elections
   - Uncertainty about COVID effect persistence

5. **Rate of Upsets**: German election administration is highly reliable, and local election turnout patterns are relatively stable. Major upsets (>5 pp deviation from recent baseline) are uncommon but possible given the 2014→2020 swing.

**Calibration Logic**:
- 10th percentile (55.5%): Modest decline from 2020, approaching but not reaching 2014 low
- 20th percentile (57.0%): Slight decline from 2020
- 40th percentile (58.5%): Near 2020 baseline, slight decline
- 60th percentile (60.0%): Modest increase continuing 2020 trend
- 80th percentile (61.5%): Strong increase, approaching 2008 levels
- 90th percentile (63.0%): Very strong increase, approaching 2002 peak

Percentile 10: 55.5
Percentile 20: 57.0
Percentile 40: 58.5
Percentile 60: 60.0
Percentile 80: 61.5
Percentile 90: 63.0
