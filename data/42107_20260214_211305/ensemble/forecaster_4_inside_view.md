Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Bayerisches Landesamt für Statistik, press release (23 Jan 2026). Administrative facts on electorate size; no turnout forecast. High quality, factual.  
2. Landesamt table for previous Kommunalwahlen (accessed 14 Feb 2026). Official statewide turnout: 2002 63.5 %, 2008 59.5 %, 2014 54.7 %, 2020 58.8 %. Highest-quality historical data.  
3. BR24 08 Aug 2025. Reports shortening of postal-ballot period from 34 → 20 days; Greens fear lower turnout, ministry says no effect. Medium quality, partly opinion.  
4. AskNews 13–14 Feb 2026 local-media reports (Merkur, Augsburger Allg., PNP, nordbayern). All show very brisk early demand for postal voting despite later start; purely factual local logistics. Moderate quality, consistent.  
5. GMS/Sat.1 Bayern poll (05 Jan 2026). Representative survey: 49 % “will definitely vote”, 24 % “probably”. Past calibration implies ≈ 59 % real turnout. Single survey but transparent; moderate evidence.  
6. Sector mobilisation pieces (DGB, Handelsverband) calling for “high turnout”. Advocacy; anecdotal, weak evidence.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong:  • Four-cycle official turnout series (structural trend).  
Moderate: • GMS poll translating to ≈ 59 % (indirect but historical calibration). • Very high early demand for postal voting, reported independently by three outlets (momentum, indirect).  
Weak: • Speculation that shorter postal-ballot window will depress turnout. • Mobilisation appeals by NGOs/trade groups.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome known in 23 days. With only three weeks left, turnout drivers are mostly baked in. If the horizon were halved (1½ weeks), forecast hardly changes (<0.3 pp). If doubled (6 weeks), slightly wider tails because campaign shocks/weather unknown.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
Base-rate centre from 2008-2020 mean ≈ 57.6 %.  
Adjust up +0.7 pp for:  
  • Rising general political engagement (EU 2024 turnout +4 pp vs 2019; Landtag 2023 still > 73 %).  
  • High recorded demand for postal voting despite shorter period, signalling convenience/interest.  
Adjust down –0.5 pp for:  
  • Loss of pandemic-related mail-voting surge of 2020.  
  • Some administrative friction (ballot-printing delay).  
Net +0.2 pp puts the centre near 57.8–58.0 %.  
Uncertainty: σ ≈ 2.6 pp gives a central 80 % range ~53–62.  
Long tails (weather, security scare, unprecedented mobilisation) warrant a little mass outside that.

Checklist:  
1. Target = statewide voter turnout (%) in Bavaria on 8 Mar 2026, first round, as published by Landesamt before 1 May 2026.  
2. Base-rate distribution rooted in 2002-2020 official series.  
3. Implied median ≈ 58.0 %, mean ≈ 58.3 %; matches rationale.  
4. Key facts: (i) 2020 turnout 58.8 %; (ii) four-election mean 57.6 %; (iii) GMS poll implies 59 %; (iv) early postal-vote demand high; (v) postal-ballot window shortened.  
5. Blind-spot: Wildly bad weather or transport strike cuts in-person voting (would push turnout below 53 %).  
6. Status-quo 57-59 % already weighted highly; small nudge to centre retained.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, units “%”, within open bounds 25–80.
