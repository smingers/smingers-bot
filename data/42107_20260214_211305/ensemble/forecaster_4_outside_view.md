Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Bayerisches Landesamt für Statistik 2020 press release – Official final turnout 58.7 %.  Highest-quality primary source, dated March 2020, purely factual.  
2. BR24 recap of 2020 results – Journalistic summary repeating the 58.8 % figure; no new data, dated April 2025 but content from 2020.  Reliable but secondary.  
3. Economics & Politics study (2022) – Peer-reviewed; confirms unusually high 2nd-round turnout in 2020 because of all-postal voting.  Factual for 2020, provides expert explanation of anomaly.  
4. nn.de reader-survey piece (2025) – Mentions “under 60 %” turnout in 2020 and contrast to 80 % in Bundestagswahl; no numbers for 2026.  Low analytical value but corroborates 2020 figure and broader gap between election types.  
5. BR24 “Superwahljahr 2026” (Dec 2025) – Expert (Stefan Merz, Infratest dimap) opines AfD will gain seats; contains no turnout estimate.  Opinion from a reputable pollster but not directly about participation.  
6. NRW 2025 article – Different state; turnout not even quoted.  Only marginally relevant for a Germany-wide mood but not used in numeric baseline.  
7. Agent report – Collates Landesamt figures 2002 (63.5 %), 2008 (59.5 %), 2014 (54.7 %), 2020 (58.7 %), plus Landtag 2023 (73.1 %) and EU-2024 (65.5 %).  Gives coherent long-series context; numbers track back to official publications.  Treated as high-quality where citing Landesamt.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
• All Bavarian Kommunalwahlen since WWII (≈13 data points) – Ideal but we have only four recent official points in hand.  
• German municipal elections in other Länder – Similar election type but different state cultures; less suitable.  
• Other recent Bavarian elections (Landtag, EP) – Same electorate but higher-salience contests; turnout systematically higher.  

Best single class for an outside view is “state-wide first-round turnout in Bavarian Kommunalwahlen”, most proximate in rules, timing and electorate.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Today is 14 Feb 2026; election day is 8 Mar 2026 – 23 days away.  None of the historic turnout shifts in the four-election series show late swings larger than ±4 pp compared with prior contest:  
2002→2008  –4.0 pp  
2008→2014  –4.8 pp  
2014→2020  +4.0 pp  
Thus, in roughly one cycle (6 years) the typical change is ≈4–5 pp; in 23 days the remaining uncertainty comes mostly from structural rather than campaign factors (weather, mail-in share, salience).

(d) Justification  
Long-run drift: 63.5 % (2002) down to 54.7 % (2014) then up to 58.7 % (2020).  The 2020 rebound coincided with record postal voting under Covid restrictions, so part of the jump may have been one-off.  Counter-point: postal voting has remained easy and popular in subsequent Bavarian elections (Landtag 2023 posted the highest turnout since 1982).  That suggests at least some permanence to the higher participation plateau.

Structural forces for 2026:  
• Elevated general political mobilisation (Landtag 2023 = 73 %, EU 2024 = 65 %).  Spill-over could lift local turnout.  
• AfD expected to surge; polarisation often raises participation.  
• No pandemic-induced all-postal round, so the mechanical boost of the 2020 second ballot is absent.  
Net outside view: mean near the midpoint between 2014 and 2020, nudged slightly upward by current mobilisation climate → centre of distribution ≈ 60 %.

Variance: With only four modern datapoints the empirical σ ≈ 3.5 pp.  To allow for unknown unknowns (e.g., extreme weather, sudden demobilising scandal, technical voting problems) I broaden tails to ±7 pp around the mean for the 10th–90th range.

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor: normal‐looking distribution centred on 60 % with 80 % of mass within ±5 pp (historical envelope), but fatter tails to respect low-frequency shocks.  
• 10th percentile set 8 pp below the mean (≈1.9 σ), 90th set 6 pp above (≈1.6 σ) because history shows sharper drops than rises.  
• Ensure monotone percentiles; choose round integer percentages for clarity.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 52  
Percentile 20: 55  
Percentile 40: 58  
Percentile 60: 60  
Percentile 80: 63  
Percentile 90: 66
