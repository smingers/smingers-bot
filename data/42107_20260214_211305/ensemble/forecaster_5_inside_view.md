Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Bayerisches Landesamt für Statistik press releases (2020 final turnout; 2026 electorate size). - Highest quality, official, dated 2020 & 23 Jan 2026. Purely factual.  
2. BR24 08 Aug 2025 – mail-in deadline shortened from 34 → 20 days; quotes Interior Ministry, Greens, municipal association. Factual change plus partisan opinions.  
3. Sat.1 Bayern / GMS poll 05 Jan 2026 – representative survey, N = 1 006; reports 49 % “definitely”, 24 % “probably” will vote. Methodology transparent; moderate quality.  
4. Multiple regional papers (Augsburger Allgemeine, Merkur, nordbayern.de, PNP) 13-14 Feb 2026 – report unusually high early demand for postal voting despite later start; factual, on-the-ground.  
5. Advocacy pieces (HBE, DGB, party meetings) – show mobilisation efforts but are single-actor opinions; weak evidence for final turnout.  
6. Historic statewide Kommunalwahlen turnout series (2002-20): 63.5 %, 59.5 %, 54.7 %, 58.8 %. Derived from official archives; strong evidence.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to outside view)  
Strong:  
• Past four statewide turnout figures (structural, official).  
• Institutional rule change: postal ballots only 20 days (enacted law).  

Moderate:  
• 2026 survey showing self-reported intention ≈59 % (close to 2020 actual).  
• Reports of robust postal-ballot demand even with shorter window.  

Weak:  
• Mobilisation campaigns by HBE, DGB, Free Voters.  
• Isolated violence against a Left candidate.  

Net directional pull: shorter postal window – down; high demand & polarisation – up; effects roughly offset → small change around 2020 level.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
23 days to election, 75 days to resolution. In the last three weeks turnout drivers rarely shift >2 pp unless extreme weather/major scandal. Halving the window (to 11 days) would marginally lower uncertainty; doubling (46 days) would broaden tails by ≈1 pp each side.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base-rate mean 59 % (sample mean 2002-20).  
Factors pushing higher:  
• AfD surge + counter-mobilisation (modest).  
• Already heavy postal-voting demand despite shorter period.  
Factors pushing lower:  
• Loss of 14 days for postal voting may deter late deciders.  
• Pandemic boost in 2020 gone.  
• Slightly smaller electorate (–220 k) skews older & less mobile.  

Magnitude estimates (pp effect vs 2020):  
+0.8 mobilisation & political heat  
–1.1 shorter postal window / no-Covid boost  
= –0.3 net.  

Hence place median 59 % (just 0.2 above 2020 58.8 due to rounding).  
Historic σ ≈2.5 pp; add extra 1 pp for policy change uncertainty → use 3.5 pp for 20/80 band and 5.5 pp for 10/90.

Distribution calibration  
Percentile 10 = 53.5 %  
Percentile 20 = 55.5 %  
Percentile 40 = 58.0 %  
Percentile 60 = 60.0 %  
Percentile 80 = 62.5 %  
Percentile 90 = 64.5 %

Mean ≈59.0 %, median ≈59.0 % — consistent with narrative.

Checklist:  
1. Target: statewide turnout (%) in Bavarian Kommunalwahl, published before 1 May 2026.  
2. Base-rate distribution from four previous elections (mean 59 %).  
3. Implied median = 59 %, mean ≈ 59 % — matches justification.  
4. Key evidence: a) 58.8 % turnout 2020 (official); b) postal window cut 34→20 days; c) survey 49 % “certain” voters → ~59 % expected; d) high early postal-ballot demand reports.  
5. Blind-spot: severe March 8 blizzard suppresses in-person voting → turnout could drop below 52 %.  
6. Status-quo ≈2020 level; my forecast hugs but slightly above.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, within open bounds, correct units.
