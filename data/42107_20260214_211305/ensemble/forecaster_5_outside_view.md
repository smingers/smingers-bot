Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Statistik-bayern.de Kommunalwahlen page (2025 administrative note). Factual, official; no turnout data.  
2. Landesamt press release on 2020 Kommunalwahl (dated 16 Mar 2020). Official, high quality; reports final turnout 58.8 %.  
3. BR24 recap of 2020 results (2025 article quoting 2020 data). Secondary but consistent with #2.  
4. Economics & Politics study on 2020 runoff (2022). Peer-reviewed; confirms unusually high mail-vote participation but offers no 2026 forecast.  
5. NRW 2025 local-election article. Different state; only context for German local turnouts.  
6. BR24 “Superwahljahr 2026” (30 Dec 2025). Contains expert opinion on party performance, not turnout.  
7. NN.de reader-survey article (2025). Gives comparative statement “< 60 % turnout in 2020”, consistent with #2.  
8. Agent-report (compiled 2026-02-14). Synthesises Landesamt historic series: 63.5 % (2002), 59.5 % (2008), 54.7 % (2014), 58.7 % (2020); also Landtag 2023 (73.1 %) and EU 2024 (65.5 %). All figures trace back to official sources; quality high.

Opinion vs fact: Only #6 offers opinion (AfD expected to gain), which is irrelevant for turnout estimate. All other quantitative turnout numbers are factual from Bavarian Statistics Office or other official election authorities.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. Bavarian Kommunalwahl statewide turnout (2002-2020, n = 4).  
2. Bavarian turnout in other election types (Landtag, Bundestag, European) 2002-2024.  
3. Local-election turnout in other large German states (e.g., NRW).  

Class 1 matches the exact election type, jurisdiction, and six-year cycle; though only four datapoints, it is the cleanest analogue. Class 2 regularly runs 10-20 pp higher and is therefore a poor direct predictor. Class 3 introduces different political cultures.  → Adopt Class 1 as baseline.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time until result known: 23 days to polling day; 76 days to official publication cut-off (1 May 2026).  Historically, Bavarian Kommunalwahl turnout has moved slowly: average change between elections 2002-2008 –4.0 pp, 2008-2014 –4.8 pp, 2014-2020 +4.0 pp.  Absolute swing per six-year interval therefore ranges 4-5 pp.  With only three weeks left, large last-minute shocks are improbable; most structural drivers (postal voting rates, party polarisation) are already baked in.

(d) Justification  
Baseline mean from the four elections = 59.1 %.  The low was 54.7 % (2014), the high 63.5 % (2002).  German absentee voting has risen steadily and reached almost 50 % in the 2023 Landtagswahl, which mechanically lifts turnout by making voting easier.  On the other side, the 2020 uptick was inflated by pandemic-driven universal postal run-off ballots, so part of that 58.8 % may reverse.  The current cycle features heightened partisan conflict (AfD surge) which historically mobilises as many opponents as supporters; net effect likely mild positive.  Combining these, the outside view central point is placed modestly above 2020, at about 60 %.  Historical six-year swings suggest a 5 pp one-sigma band; allowing fat tails (+/-8 pp) covers unknowns such as severe weather or system glitches.  Hence the 80 % credible interval spans roughly 54–64 %, with extreme 10/90 % at 54/66 to reflect very small but non-zero chance of a return to 2014-style apathy or a 2002-level high aided by record postal voting.

Outside view calibration:
• Anchor on Class 1 mean (59 %).  
• Apply symmetric ±1 σ ≈ 5 pp for 20th & 80th percentiles.  
• Extend tails by another 2 pp for 10th & 90th to account for unforeseeable shocks (upsets historically rare but not impossible).  
• Ensure monotone CDF and round to nearest 0.5 pp for clarity.  Distribution is wider than naïve sample s.d. to avoid overconfidence.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 54  
Percentile 20: 56  
Percentile 40: 58.5  
Percentile 60: 60.5  
Percentile 80: 63.5  
Percentile 90: 66
