Analysis:
The key to forecasting statewide voter turnout is understanding (a) the historical trend in Bavarian local-election turnout (2020, 2014, 2008, etc.), (b) any structural changes since 2020 (e.g., new postal-voting rules, simultaneous referenda, Covid no longer a factor), and (c) late-breaking indicators of mobilisation or apathy (party campaigns, strike actions, weather forecasts, postal-vote requests, fresh polling on “definitely will vote”).  Therefore, the most useful current information will come from:
• Official statistics or press releases from the Bayerisches Landesamt für Statistik about postal-ballot applications to date.  
• News coverage or expert commentary discussing expected turnout, perhaps citing political scientists or party strategists.  
• Polls by institutes such as Forschungsgruppe Wahlen, Infratest dimap, or GMS that include a “voter certainty” question for the Kommunalwahl 2026.  
• Articles covering any concurrent events (e.g., refugee-centre referendums, farmers’ protests) that might drive voters to the polls.  

To capture these angles I need:  
1) A broad Google web search for background and official statistical releases.  
2) A Google News search focused on the very latest reportage or opinion pieces.  
3) An AskNews natural-language query soliciting any recent polling or expert forecasts about 2026 turnout relative to 2020.
