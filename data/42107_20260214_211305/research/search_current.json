In nearly half of the 46 municipalities\u2014six cities, eight market towns, and 32 communities\u2014new mayors will be elected due to incumbent non-renewal, including in Schwabm\u00fcnchen, Gersthofen, Biberbach, Diedorf, Dinkelscherben, Fischach, and Zusmarshausen. Four elections will be held simultaneously: municipal or city council, district council, district administrator (Landrat), and mayoral elections, except in Stadtbergen and Gessertshausen, where no mayoral election occurs. Voters receive one vote for the district administrator and mayoral elections, and as many additional votes as there are seats on the respective council\u201470 for the district council, 8 in small communities like K\u00fchlenthal, and 30 in larger cities such as K\u00f6nigsbrunn, Neus\u00e4\u00df, and Gersthofen. Voters may choose a full list (standard voting), cumulate votes (assigning one, two, or three votes to preferred candidates), or panaschieren (selecting candidates from different lists), but must not exceed the total number of votes allowed. Voters may also strike names from a list if they disagree with a candidate. The Landkreis Augsburg recommends pre-voting preparation via the official website (www.landkreis-augsburg.de/kommunalwahlen2026), including testing vote validity with an interactive mock ballot. Ballot envelopes will be sent starting February 16, but due to potential postal delays, direct drop-off at the town hall is advised starting early March. In the 2020 elections, 62,673 voters used absentee ballots, contributing to a 60% turnout. All ballots, including absentee ones, will be opened and counted only after 6:00 PM. Preliminary results for mayoral elections are expected around 6:30 PM, with district administrator results by 7:00 PM, followed by city and community council and district council vote counts.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 05:01 PM\nSource:[Augsburger Allgemeine](https://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/augsburg-land/das-muessen-sie-zur-kommunalwahl-im-landkreis-augsburg-wissen-113458831)\n\n**Pocking Ready for Municipal Elections: Postal Ballot Application Begins Monday**\nThe city of Pocking, Bavaria, is preparing for the upcoming municipal elections on Sunday, March 8, 2026. All approximately 13,000 eligible voters have received their election notification letters. Voters wishing to participate via postal ballot can apply for ballot materials starting Monday, February 16, 2026, through various methods: in person, in writing, by fax, email, or online via the city\u2019s portal at www.pocking.de. A QR code in the notification letter allows smartphone-based applications. Telephone requests and SMS applications are not permitted. The postal ballot office, located next to the registration office in the Stadtparkzimmer, will be open Monday to Friday from 8 to 12, and Monday to Wednesday from 13 to 16, and Thursday until 17. It can also be reached by phone at 08531/709-39, including on Carnival Tuesday. The office allows voters to cast their ballots on-site while preserving ballot secrecy. Deputy election officer Andreas Lang emphasized that the city is committed to making the process as easy and convenient as possible, offering brochures and staff assistance. Voters are urged to follow the instructions in the attached leaflet to avoid rejection of their ballots. Additional applications and pickups are available on Friday, March 6, from 13 to 15. In case of a potential county or mayoral runoff on March 22, 2026, ballot applications can also be made for those elections.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 10:00 AM\nSource:[Passauer Neue Presse](https://www.pnp.de/lokales/landkreis-passau/pocking-ist-bereit-fuer-die-kommunalwahl-ab-montag-startet-die-briefwahlausgabe-20517952)\n\n**High Demand for Postal Voting in S\u00fcdlandkreis Amid Delayed Ballot Delivery**\nThe demand for postal voting in the S\u00fcdlandkreis region is high ahead of the upcoming municipal elections, with preparations underway despite a delayed delivery of ballot papers for the district and county council elections. According to Landkreis office spokesperson Marlis Peischer, the delivery of ballots was postponed and is now scheduled for the following day, with municipalities informed about collection arrangements. While some communities have already packaged 500 postal voting kits (e.g., Gai\u00dfach), others are awaiting the ballots. Felix Kellner of Jachenau noted that the high demand is understandable given the large ballot for the district council. The final voter notifications were sent out on Thursday, with the next critical phase being a potential run-off election, which would require rapid processing and distribution of ballots within two weeks. In T\u00f6lz, residents can apply for postal voting via the back of their notification, through a QR code, or online; the notifications must arrive by Sunday at the latest, with nearly all sent. In exceptional cases, voters without a notification can obtain one at the residents' registration office or on election day with ID. Rathaus spokesperson Birte Stahl emphasized the importance of accounting for postal delivery times, as ballots must be received by the town hall by 6:00 PM on March 8. In Benediktbeuern and Bichl, 1,200 postal voting kits have been requested\u2014equivalent to about a quarter of the eligible voters\u2014delaying preparations due to the delayed ballot delivery. In Kochel, 750 of 3,224 eligible voters have already applied, and the municipality is prepared for high turnout. In Lenggries, around 900 people have applied for postal voting since last week, with officials explaining that ballots can only be issued starting February 16. The election office remains available for inquiries.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 06:03 PM\nSource:[Merkur.de](https://www.merkur.de/lokales/bad-toelz/bad-toelz-ort28297/briefwahl-ansturm-trotz-verzoegerter-stimmzettel-lieferung-94167633.html)\n\n**Bavarian Municipal Elections on March 8: Key Tips for Postal Voting**\nThe upcoming municipal elections in Bavaria, including Franconia, are scheduled for March 8, 2026.

Mayor candidate Alexander Zacher stressed that the municipal council makes key decisions and expressed concern over low turnout at campaign events, noting attendance was similar to previous meetings by CSU and SPD. He highlighted a positive six-year record, citing achievements such as the ILE regional budget, cost-effective renovation of the municipal workshop, installation of a solar power plant at the wastewater treatment facility, the CSU\u2019s proposal for Homburger Kante, and the introduction of municipal traffic surveillance starting April 2026. Zacher praised unified efforts on the kindergarten renovation, resulting in a modern model daycare center. While a site for a senior care facility exists, no investor has yet been secured. The party\u2019s 2026 election platform, available at https://www.fw-moos.de/wahlen/kommunalwahl-2026, emphasizes infrastructure preservation and expansion, support for volunteerism and clubs, fire department equipment, cultural and educational promotion, affordable housing, traffic safety, and energy-efficient renovation of public buildings. Zacher emphasized honest communication with citizens, noting that some issues\u2014like the desired roundabout at Buhmannkreuzung and flood protection\u2014lie beyond local control. He criticized the imbalance between taxing municipalities and spending millions on space exploration. He concluded by expressing hope for continued constructive collaboration with the council. The candidate list, presented by deputy party chair Gerhard Weigl using PowerPoint, is led by Alexander Zacher, followed by Stefan Anzenberger, Sebastian Kreiller, Michael Kr\u00f6ninger, Dr. Winfried Speer, Melanie Langer, Xaver Altsch\u00e4fl, Dr. Wolfgang Schuster, Stefan Leutner, Thomas Gei\u00dfinger, Roland K\u00fchbeck junior, Florian Knogler, and Thomas Thalhammer, with Andreas K\u00fchbeck and Thomas Zehntner as alternates. For the district council, Zacher, Weigl, and Kr\u00f6ninger are running. Stefan Anzenberger explained correct voting procedures using cumulation and panaschage, warning that exceeding the total vote limit invalidates ballots. In the Q&A, CSU\u2019s Uli Achatz argued that elected representatives should handle issues beyond local control. SPD\u2019s Ludwig Allinger criticized overlapping event schedules, while Hans J\u00e4ger recommended biannual club meetings and avoiding exclusive reliance on digital sign-ups. A follow-up event is scheduled for February 25 at 'Isarhofener Grill,' and the Free Voters will meet on February 18 for a district-level Ash Wednesday political gathering at Gasthaus H\u00f6rner.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 08:00 AM\nSource:[Passauer Neue Presse](https://www.pnp.de/lokales/landkreis-deggendorf/wahlversammlung-der-freien-waehler-moos-langenisarhofen-appell-an-waehler-20510131)\n\n**How Municipal Elections in Bavaria Stay Secure: A #Faktenfuchs Investigation**\nThe article '#Faktenfuchs: What Makes Municipal Elections Secure' explains that despite the large number of municipal elections in Bavaria\u2014over 4,000 on March 8, 2024\u2014election manipulation is highly unlikely due to robust institutional safeguards. Experts, including Martin Gross from LMU Munich and Daniel Hellmann from the Institute for Parliamentary Research, emphasize that the sheer volume of elections and the presence of multiple oversight layers make widespread fraud improbable. Historical cases of election manipulation in Bavaria, such as in Dachau (2002) and Geiselh\u00f6ring (2014), are rare. Key safeguards include the 'multi-eye principle' (Vier-Augen-Prinzip) in vote counting, mandatory multi-member election boards, rechecking of results, and public oversight. The article notes that due to fewer voters per seat in municipal elections (around 1,000 vs. 33,000 in state elections), even small irregularities are more likely to be detected. Complex voting systems\u2014such as cumulative and panaschier voting in Munich, where voters can assign up to 80 votes\u2014increase the risk of human error, but these are mitigated by careful procedures, re-counts, and plausibility checks. If discrepancies arise, a full re-count is standard practice. The final results are confirmed by a public election committee and reviewed by the regional supervisory authority (Landratsamt or Ministry of the Interior), which can order a re-count if anomalies are found. Any citizen can challenge the results within 14 days, and legal action is possible if fraud is proven. The article concludes that while no system is perfect, the combination of transparency, public access, and multiple verification steps makes election fraud in Bavarian municipal elections 'virtually impossible,' as affirmed by both experts and historical data.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 06:12 AM\nSource:[Bayerischer Rundfunk](https://www.br.de/nachrichten/bayern/faktenfuchs-was-die-kommunalwahlen-sicher-macht,VB17HLB)\n\n**XXL Ballots and High Postal Voting: How the Municipal Election Unfolds in the Donau-Ries District**\nThe municipal election in the Donau-Ries district of Bavaria is approaching, with voting scheduled for March 8, 2026. Around 109,000 eligible voters are participating in selecting the district administrator, mayors, and city or municipal council members. A significant number of residents are already opting for postal voting: over 2,000 applications were submitted by Tuesday afternoon in the city of Harburg, representing nearly half of its 4,450 eligible voters. The city plans to reduce in-person voting locations to just two in the Harburg School on election day, due to a prior decision to phase out polling stations in local districts for the 2026 election. Voters who cannot attend in person can request transportation assistance through the Harburg town hall. Postal voting applications must be submitted by March 6, 2026, at 3:00 PM, and completed ballots must arrive by March 8, 2026, at 6:00 PM. The election materials are complex: the district council ballot is 1.26 meters wide and 70 centimeters tall, with 558 candidates listed across 11 party lists of up to 60 names each. Voters receive as many votes as there are seats to fill for each body, with up to three votes per individual candidate and the option to vote for entire lists. A common error is casting too many votes, rendering ballots invalid. In cases where only one candidate runs for mayor or only one list is submitted for the council, voters may write in additional names, but cannot re-vote for candidates already on the list. Eligibility extends to EU citizens residing in the district, and candidates only need a secondary residence in the municipality to run. The Landratsamt warns of the complexity of the ballot, which increases the risk of invalid votes.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 05:08 AM\nSource:[Augsburger Allgemeine](https://www.augsburger-allgemeine.de/donauwoerth/kommunalwahlen-waehler-nutzen-briefwahl-im-landkreis-donau-ries-113454473)\n\n**Munich's Unconventional Approach to Voter Education: Comic Guide for 2026 Municipal Elections**\nThe city of Munich has launched an unconventional educational initiative to inform voters ahead of the 2026 Bavarian municipal elections. On its website, muenchen.de, a comic titled 'Eine kleine Anleitung zu den Kommunalwahlen' (A Small Guide to Municipal Elections) is available as a downloadable PDF for first-time voters. The comic explains the voting process in a simple, accessible format, covering key details such as the requirement to cast only one vote in the mayoral election, up to 80 votes in the city council election, the prohibition of notes on ballots, and the option to vote for entire candidate lists. The initiative, described as 'low-threshold' by a spokesperson from the Munich District Administrative Office (KVR), aims to improve clarity and reduce invalid votes. The comic was first introduced in 2020 and has since received positive feedback from teachers, who use it in classrooms, and older voters, who prefer its visual format over traditional text. The city cites data from the 2021 federal election showing that first-time voters (born between 1997 and 2003) had a slightly higher invalid vote rate (0.5%) compared to experienced voters (0.4%), while the oldest group (born 1951 or earlier) had the highest invalid rate at 0.9%. The comic is part of a broader set of voter aids, including the 'M\u00fcnchen-O-Mat', a tool allowing citizens to compare their political views with those of parties and voter groups. The initiative targets approximately 700,000 first-time voters across Bavaria.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 02:38 PM\nSource:[tz](https://www.tz.de/bayern/kommunalwahl-bayern-ere1211475/muenchen-comic-erklaert-kommunalwahl-2026-bayern-anleitung-erstwaehler-kampagne-statistik-94163539.html)\n\n**Platform Aggregates Bavarian Local Election Results: How Communities Can Contribute**\nOn March 8, 2026, local elections will take place in Bavaria, including elections for mayors, district administrators, city councils, and municipal councils. Unlike other regions, Bavarian election results are not centrally collected or published; instead, each city, municipality, and district is responsible for reporting results independently, typically through public notices at town halls or by posting them on their official websites. To improve real-time reporting and transparency, the Augsburger Allgemeine is collaborating with the Austrian company 23degrees, which aims to centrally and systematically aggregate election results. According to 23degrees, a centralized and reliable data source is essential for transparent media coverage and for political and academic analysis.

The meeting, chaired by election supervisor Sabine Plate\u2011Ernst in the town hall conference room, followed strict procedural rules: the committee members received the voting records and precinct results in paper form, as required by regulations.  Plate\u2011Ernst noted that voter turnout was about 59\u202f%, which she said was lower than turnout for federal elections.  She explained the divisor method used to allocate council seats based on the results.  The committee praised the election workers for a flawless performance, while also pointing out that the bureaucratic effort involved in conducting such an election is considerable.  The confirmed results will be implemented on 10\u202fNovember when the newly elected council convenes for its first session.  The article quotes Plate\u2011Ernst as saying, 'Das Interesse der B\u00fcrger an Kommunalwahlen etwas geringer sei als etwa an Bundestagswahlen.'\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 19, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[come-on.de](https://www.come-on.de/lennetal/herscheid/pruefung-der-wahlergebnisse-ausschuss-moniert-hohen-buerokratischen-aufwand-93942621.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
