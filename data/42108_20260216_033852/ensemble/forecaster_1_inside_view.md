## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles:**

1. **Franceinfo (Feb 15, 2026)**: Comprehensive overview of 51 key cities. **Strong factual content**: Lists RN candidate Franck Allisio in Marseille with "good polling," no RN candidate mentioned for Toulouse or Lyon. High credibility, current date.

2. **Le Parisien (Feb 7, 2026)**: Detailed polling data. **Key facts**: Marseille shows Payan and Allisio tied at 31%; Lyon shows RN candidate Humbert-Dupalais at 9% (below 10% threshold); Toulouse shows RN candidate Leonardelli at 8%. Named polling firms (Cluster 17). High credibility, very recent.

3. **France Inter (Feb 2, 2026)**: Editorial analysis. **Opinion from expert source**: States RN "can even dream of a triple Mediterranean bingo: Marseille-Nice-Toulon" but notes "Marseille alone would be an earthquake" (suggesting it would be surprising). Characterizes election as "most unpredictable in half a century." Moderate credibility for factual context.

4. **20 Minutes (Feb 14, 2026)**: Fact-check article. **Factual**: Confirms Payan and Allisio "neck and neck" in polls for Marseille. Focuses on crime statistics debate. Recent, credible.

5. **Le Figaro (Jan 22, 2026)**: **Factual statement from Jordan Bardella**: RN president states party aims to win "several dozen communes" and identifies Marseille as a "major objective." Direct quote from party leader. Credible source.

6. **Franceinfo (Feb 12, 2026)**: Marseille-specific polling. **Key facts**: Late January poll shows Payan and Allisio both at 31%, Vassal at 20%. **Opinion from Martine Vassal** (candidate): "Marseille...will not go to the Rassemblement National." Recent, credible polling data.

**AskNews Articles:**

7. **Multiple sources (Feb 14-15, 2026)**: Confirm voting system details, campaign timeline. **Factual**: First round March 15, second round March 22. 10% threshold for second-round qualification.

10. **Franceinfo (Feb 14, 2026)**: RN strategy article. **Factual**: Lists RN targets including Marseille, Toulon, Nice. Notes party currently controls only Perpignan among major cities.

11. **La Dépêche (Jan 21, 2026)**: Comprehensive polling summary. **Key facts**: Marseille tied at 30-30; Lyon shows RN at 9%; Toulouse shows RN at 8%. Named polling firms. High credibility.

12. **Historical sources (2020 results)**: **Factual**: 2020 Marseille saw RN at ~20% in second round, losing decisively. Lyon and Toulouse had minimal RN presence.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Multiple independent polls (Le Parisien, La Dépêche, Franceinfo) all confirm Marseille first-round tie at 30-31%** for RN candidate Allisio. This is unprecedented and represents a structural shift from 2020 (8% city-wide).
- **Lyon RN candidate consistently polled at 9-10%**, just below the 10% second-round qualification threshold. Multiple sources confirm this.
- **Toulouse RN candidate consistently at 8-10%**, below qualification threshold. Multiple sources confirm.
- **Historical institutional factor**: Two-round system with republican front has **never** allowed RN to win any of these three cities. This is a strong structural barrier.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **No second-round polling showing RN victory scenario in Marseille**. Agent report cites scenarios showing RN at 42-45% (losing). This suggests even with strong first-round showing, traditional alliance dynamics favor opponents.
- **Expert assessment (France Inter)**: Characterizes potential RN Marseille win as "earthquake," suggesting low base rate expectation.
- **Jordan Bardella statement**: RN explicitly targeting Marseille as "major objective" shows strategic focus, but doesn't indicate confidence in victory.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Martine Vassal opinion**: "Marseille will not go to RN" - this is candidate opinion, not expert analysis.
- **TF1 INFO assessment** (from outside view): Doesn't list these three cities as likely RN wins, but this is editorial judgment without detailed methodology.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 37 days total (Feb 16 to March 25, 2026)
- First round: 27 days away (March 15)
- Second round: 34 days away (March 22)
- Resolution: 37 days away (March 25)

**If timeframe halved (18 days)**: Would increase uncertainty slightly as less time for campaign dynamics to shift polling, but wouldn't fundamentally change structural factors (two-round system, republican front). Might increase probability by 1-2% due to less time for opposition consolidation.

**If timeframe doubled (74 days)**: Would decrease RN probability as more time allows for:
- Opposition alliance formation and strategic withdrawals
- Campaign scrutiny of RN candidate
- Mobilization of republican front
Historical pattern: RN support tends to soften in later campaign stages in major cities. Might decrease probability by 3-5%.

**Current timeframe assessment**: 27 days to first round is enough time for current polling to largely hold, but second-round dynamics (alliance formation, strategic withdrawals) remain highly uncertain and historically favor anti-RN coalitions.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view base rate: 12%**

This was anchored to:
- 0% historical success in these three cities
- Marseille showing unprecedented first-round competitiveness (31%)
- Lyon and Toulouse non-competitive
- Two-round system disadvantage

**Current evidence assessment:**

**Factors supporting increase from 12%:**
1. **Marseille polling is remarkably consistent across multiple sources** (30-31% for RN) - this is not a single outlier poll but a genuine structural shift
2. **Only 27 days to first round** - less time for polling to shift dramatically
3. **Four-way second round expected in Marseille** - more fragmentation could benefit RN if opposition doesn't consolidate effectively
4. **National RN momentum** - party at historical high in national politics

**Factors supporting decrease from 12%:**
1. **No second-round polling shows RN winning** - even agent report scenarios show RN losing 42-45% vs 55-58%
2. **Lyon RN at 9%** - likely won't even qualify for second round (needs 10%)
3. **Toulouse RN at 8%** - definitely won't qualify for second round
4. **Historical republican front effectiveness** - has prevented RN victories in major cities even when leading first rounds
5. **Two-round system systematically disadvantages RN** - strategic voting and withdrawals favor coalitions

**Critical assessment:**

The question requires victory in **at least one** city. Current evidence shows:
- **Lyon: ~0.5-1%** (below qualification threshold, no path to victory)
- **Toulouse: ~0.5-1%** (below qualification threshold, no path to victory)
- **Marseille: This is the entire probability mass**

For Marseille specifically:
- First-round tie (31-31%) is unprecedented
- But second-round scenarios show RN losing by 10-13 points
- Republican front has 100% success rate in preventing RN victories in major cities
- However, polling volatility (±3-4%) means outcomes near 45-55% split are within uncertainty range

**Calibration logic:**

If RN needs ~50%+ in Marseille second round to win:
- Current scenarios show 42-45% for RN
- Gap of 5-8 points to overcome
- Polling error could account for 3-4 points
- Unexpected alliance breakdown could account for additional shift
- But historical pattern shows republican front holding

Probability RN wins Marseille second round: ~15-18%
- Base: 10% (historical upset rate with republican front)
- +5% for unprecedented first-round strength
- +3% for polling showing closer race than any previous election
- -0% for structural barriers (already priced into base)

Combined with Lyon (~0.5%) and Toulouse (~0.5%):
**Total: ~16-19%**

This represents a modest increase from 12% outside view, justified by:
1. Marseille polling showing genuine competitiveness (not just first-round strength but closer second-round scenarios than ever before)
2. Short timeframe limiting opposition consolidation time
3. Statistical possibility of polling error favoring RN

However, increase is limited by:
1. No second-round polling showing RN victory
2. Perfect historical record of republican front in major cities
3. Lyon and Toulouse contributing negligible probability

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view base rate of 12%, I adjust upward to **17%** based on:

**Primary driver**: Marseille polling shows RN at 31% first round (tied for lead) and second-round scenarios at 42-45% (losing but closer than any previous election). This represents a genuine structural shift from 2020 (8% city-wide).

**Supporting factors**: 
- Multiple independent polls confirm Marseille competitiveness
- Short timeframe (27 days) limits opposition consolidation
- Four-way second round creates fragmentation risk

**Limiting factors**:
- No polling shows RN winning second round
- Republican front has 100% success rate in major cities
- Lyon (9%) and Toulouse (8%) below qualification thresholds
- Two-round system systematically disadvantages RN

The 5-point increase from 12% to 17% reflects that Marseille is genuinely competitive for the first time, but structural barriers (republican front, two-round system) make RN victory still unlikely. Lyon and Toulouse contribute ~1% combined.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will RN win mayoralty in Marseille, Lyon, or Toulouse by March 25, 2026? Elections March 15 (first round) and March 22 (second round).

2. **Outside view base rate**: 12% (0% historical success, but Marseille showing unprecedented competitiveness at 31% first-round polling)

3. **Consistency check**: "17 out of 100 times, RN wins at least one of these three mayoralties." This aligns with Marseille being genuinely competitive but facing structural disadvantages, while Lyon and Toulouse are non-factors.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - Marseille: Multiple polls show RN tied at 30-31% first round (unprecedented)
   - Second-round scenarios show RN at 42-45% in Marseille (losing but closer than ever)
   - Lyon (9%) and Toulouse (8%) below 10% qualification threshold
   - Republican front has 100% success rate preventing RN victories in major cities
   - Two-round system with strategic voting systematically disadvantages RN

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Opposition fragmentation in Marseille second round - if left/center candidates refuse to withdraw or form alliances, RN could win with 40-45% in a divided field. This could push probability to 25-30%.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Status quo is RN not winning any of these cities (historical pattern). Current polling shows departure from status quo in Marseille only. Given 27-day timeframe and structural barriers, modest shift toward status quo might be warranted, but Marseille polling is too consistent to dismiss. Staying at 17%.

Probability: 17%
