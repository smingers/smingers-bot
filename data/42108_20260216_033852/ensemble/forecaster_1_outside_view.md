Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Web Articles:**

1. **Statista (2020 Marseille results)**: Limited utility—references 2020 second-round results but doesn't provide actual data. Quality unclear due to incomplete extraction.

2. **Jacobin (February 2020)**: Pre-2020 election analysis. Notes RN won 2019 European elections in Marseille but focuses on left-wing coalitions. Factual on electoral mechanics but speculative on outcomes. Historical context only.

3. **Fifth-and-a-Half Republic (July 2020)**: Post-2020 election analysis. **Key fact**: RN took 19% first round and 20% second round in Marseille 2020. Notes historical right-wing reluctance to ally with RN, though "bridgeheads" emerging. High-quality retrospective analysis.

4. **La Dépêche (January 21-22, 2026)**: **Critical source—most recent polling**. 
   - Marseille: Ipsos poll (Jan 12, 2026) shows Payan (left) and **Allisio (RN) tied at 30%** first round
   - Lyon: Opinion Way (Dec 2025) shows **Dupalais (RN) at 10%**, trailing Aulas (46%) and Doucet (25%)
   - Toulouse: Cluster 17 poll (Nov 2025) shows **RN at 10%**, trailing Moudenc (33%) and Briançon (30%)
   - High-quality, recent polling data from named firms

5. **Le Parisien (February 11, 2026)**: Toulouse-focused. Cluster 17/Politico poll shows Moudenc 34%, Briançon 32%, Piquemal (LFI) 19%. **No mention of RN candidate**. Recent and credible.

6. **TF1 INFO (February 12, 2026)**: **Most recent overview**. Lists RN targets (Toulon, Carcassonne, etc.) but **explicitly does not list Marseille, Lyon, or Toulouse as potential RN victories**. Expert assessment suggests RN not competitive in these three cities. High credibility as major news source.

**Agent Report:**

Comprehensive historical analysis with strong factual grounding:
- **Historical baseline**: RN/FN has never won mayoralty in any of the three cities
- **Marseille**: Best historical performance—22.6% (1995), won one sector in 2014 (Ravier), but only ~8% city-wide in 2020
- **Lyon**: Never qualified for second round under PLM law (since 1983); zero councilors since 2008
- **Toulouse**: Consistently 4-8% since 1980s; never maintained second-round presence

**2026 polling summary**:
- Marseille: Allisio (RN) 31% tied with Payan; scenarios show 42-45% second round (loses)
- Lyon: Dupalais 10%, unlikely to qualify for second round
- Toulouse: Leonardelli 8%, below qualification threshold

High-quality synthesis with specific citations and dates.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **RN performance in major French cities (>200k pop) in municipal elections**: Most relevant. RN has won Perpignan (2020, pop ~120k) and Fréjus (2014, pop ~50k) but never a top-10 city. Success rate in major cities: ~0-2%.

2. **Far-right breakthrough in established left/center strongholds**: Broader European context shows occasional breakthroughs (e.g., Italy, Austria) but French municipal system with two-round runoffs and republican front tradition has been highly resistant.

3. **Marseille-specific RN performance trajectory**: Shows growth from 8% (2001) → 22% (2014 sectors) → 8% (2020 city-wide) → 31% (2026 polling). Volatile but trending upward in 2026.

**Most suitable**: Combination of #1 (RN in major cities) and #3 (Marseille-specific trajectory), weighted toward Marseille since it's the only competitive scenario.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

- **Prediction window**: 37 days (Feb 16 to March 25, 2026)
- **First round**: March 15, 2026 (27 days away)
- **Second round**: March 22, 2026 (34 days away)

**Historical patterns over similar periods:**
- Polling 1-2 months before French municipal elections has shown reasonable accuracy for first-round positioning but second-round dynamics heavily depend on alliance formation
- The "republican front" (center-left-right cooperation against RN) has historically prevented RN victories even when they lead first rounds
- 2020 Marseille: RN maintained ~20% across both rounds, suggesting limited growth potential in runoffs
- Two-round system systematically disadvantages RN due to strategic voting and withdrawals

**(d) Justification:**

The question asks whether RN wins the mayoralty in **at least one** of three cities. Based on evidence:

**Lyon**: RN at 10% in polling, historically never qualified for second round, no credible path to victory. Probability: ~0-1%.

**Toulouse**: RN at 8-10% in polling, historically weak (4-8%), explicitly trying to "pass 10%" threshold. No credible path to victory. Probability: ~0-1%.

**Marseille**: Only competitive scenario. RN tied at 31% first round, but:
- Second-round scenarios show 42-45% (losing to 55-58%)
- Historical pattern: RN peaked at 22% (1995, 2014 sectors) but faced republican front
- 2020: Only 8% city-wide despite national RN strength
- Current polling shows Payan benefits from left consolidation
- TF1 INFO (expert assessment) doesn't list Marseille as likely RN win
- Two-round system disadvantages RN through strategic voting

**Key factors reducing RN probability:**
1. No historical precedent in any of three cities
2. Two-round system with republican front tradition
3. Even in Marseille's "best case," second-round polling shows RN losing
4. Lyon and Toulouse show no competitive presence
5. Expert assessments (TF1) don't predict RN victory in these cities

**Factors increasing RN probability:**
1. Marseille polling shows unprecedented first-round strength (31%)
2. National RN momentum in recent years
3. Statistical uncertainty in polling (±3-4%)
4. Potential for fragmented opposition in Marseille

Outside view calibration:

The base rate for RN winning mayoralties in major French cities is effectively 0% (never achieved in top-10 cities). However, 2026 Marseille polling represents a genuine departure from historical patterns.

Rough figures to tether to:
- Marseille second-round scenarios: RN at 42-45% (losing)
- Historical RN second-round ceiling in Marseille: ~20%
- Polling margin of error: ±3-4%

The question requires victory in "at least one" city, so I should sum probabilities:
- Lyon: ~0.5% (extremely unlikely, below qualification threshold)
- Toulouse: ~0.5% (extremely unlikely, below qualification threshold)  
- Marseille: This is the critical estimate

For Marseille, even with 31% first-round polling:
- Second-round polling shows RN losing by 10-13 points
- Republican front has historically been effective
- No precedent for RN winning a major city of this size
- However, polling shows closer race than any previous election

Upset rate in French municipal elections with republican front: Historically very low (~1-2% for far-right in major cities), but 2026 shows unusual conditions.

Given:
- 0% historical success rate in these three cities
- Marseille showing unprecedented competitiveness but still trailing in second-round scenarios
- Lyon and Toulouse showing no competitive presence
- Systematic disadvantage from two-round system
- Expert assessments not predicting RN victory

A calibrated probability should reflect that Marseille is genuinely competitive for the first time but still more likely to lose than win, while Lyon and Toulouse are non-factors.
