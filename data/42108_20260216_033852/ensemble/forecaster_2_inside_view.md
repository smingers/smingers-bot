Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles:**

1. **Franceinfo (15 Feb 2026)** - Major French public broadcaster. Provides comprehensive list of 51 cities to watch, including specific candidate names and polling data. High quality, current. **Factual content:** Names RN candidate Franck Allisio in Marseille with "good polling"; no RN candidate mentioned for Toulouse or Lyon.

2. **Le Parisien (7 Feb 2026)** - Major national daily. Reports specific polling data from professional firms. High quality, very recent. **Factual content:** Marseille: Allisio (RN) tied at 31% with Payan; Lyon: Humbert-Dupalais (RN) at 9%, below 10% threshold; Toulouse: Leonardelli (RN) at 8%, below threshold.

3. **France Inter (2 Feb 2026)** - Public radio, reputable. **Opinion from journalist:** "RN can even dream of a triple Mediterranean bingo: Marseille-Nice-Toulon" and "Marseille alone would be an earthquake." Indicates expert view that Marseille is plausible but would be shocking.

4. **20 Minutes (14 Feb 2026)** - Free daily, fact-checking article. **Factual content:** Confirms Allisio and Payan are "neck and neck" in polls; provides crime statistics context.

5. **Le Figaro (22 Jan 2026)** - Major conservative daily. **Factual content:** Jordan Bardella (RN president) publicly identifies Marseille as "a major objective."

6. **Franceinfo (12 Feb 2026)** - **Opinion from Martine Vassal (candidate):** "Marseille is a cosmopolitan city that will not go to the Rassemblement National." Partisan opinion but from credible local politician.

**AskNews Articles:**

7. **Multiple sources (Feb 2026)** - Confirm RN fielding 650+ lists nationwide, targeting "several dozen" communes. Marseille consistently mentioned as top target. Lyon and Toulouse show RN candidates below qualification threshold in all polls.

8. **Polling compilation (15 Feb 2026)** - Le HuffPost map shows consistent pattern: Marseille competitive, Lyon/Toulouse RN well below viability.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Multiple independent polls (Le Parisien, Franceinfo, Le HuffPost) from January-February 2026** show Marseille RN at 30-31%, tied for first place. This is unprecedented for RN in these three cities. However, this is still first-round polling, and the two-round system historically produces anti-RN coalitions.
- **Structural factor:** French two-round system with 10% qualification threshold. Lyon (9%) and Toulouse (8%) RN candidates are below this threshold in all available polls, making second-round qualification unlikely.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **RN strategic focus:** Party president Bardella publicly naming Marseille as major objective suggests resource concentration there, not Lyon/Toulouse.
- **Historical pattern:** In 2020 and prior cycles, RN regularly qualified for second rounds in Marseille but lost due to left-right coalitions. Current 31% first-round polling is higher than historical performance but still vulnerable to coalitions.
- **Timeline:** Only 4 weeks to first round. French municipal polling typically stable in final month; major shifts occur between rounds via alliances, not opinion changes.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Anecdotal:** Vassal's opinion that Marseille won't go RN is partisan but reflects local knowledge of coalition dynamics.
- **National trend:** RN at ~35% nationally is higher than historical, but municipal elections have weak correlation with national sentiment (2020 green wave didn't predict 2022 presidential results).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeframe:** 27 days to first round (15 March), 34 days to second round (22 March).

**If halved (2 weeks):** Probability would increase slightly (~18-19%) as less time for anti-RN coalition building, though polling would be more stable.

**If doubled (2 months):** Probability would decrease (~14-15%) as more time allows for strategic withdrawals, coalition formation, and potential RN candidate scandals or missteps.

The short timeframe slightly favors the status quo (RN competitive in Marseille, non-viable in Lyon/Toulouse) with limited room for dramatic shifts.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view base rate: 16.7%**

**Factors warranting adjustment:**

**Upward (+):**
1. **Marseille polling strength:** 31% and tied for first is historically unprecedented. In a four-way second round, RN could win with ~35-40% if opposition splits. (+3 pp)
2. **Confirmed RN candidates in all three cities:** Unlike some past cycles, RN is fielding credible candidates everywhere. (+1 pp)

**Downward (-):**
1. **Lyon and Toulouse non-viability:** With RN at 8-9% in both cities, well below the 10% threshold, the probability of winning either is near-zero. The question asks for "at least one," but two of three cities are effectively off the table. (-2 pp)
2. **Republican front still functional:** Vassal (20%) and Delogu (14%) voters in Marseille are likely to coalesce against RN in second round. Historical pattern holds. (-1 pp)
3. **Time constraint:** Only 4 weeks limits RN's ability to expand beyond current 31% ceiling. (-0.5 pp)

**Net adjustment:** +3 +1 -2 -1 -0.5 = +0.5 pp

**Revised estimate:** 16.7% + 0.5% = 17.2%

However, I need to account for the concentration of probability: essentially all probability mass is in Marseille alone. Lyon and Toulouse contribute <1% combined. This suggests the question reduces to "Will RN win Marseille?" 

For Marseille specifically:
- Base rate for RN winning Marseille in one cycle: ~4-5% historically
- Current polling: 31% first round, but needs ~45-50% in second round with typical coalitions
- Historical second-round performance: RN typically gains 3-5 pp between rounds in Marseille
- Probability of opposition failing to unite: ~30-40% in current fragmented landscape

**Marseille-specific calculation:**
P(RN qualifies for round 2) ≈ 95% (virtually certain at 31%)
P(opposition fails to unite | RN in round 2) ≈ 35%
P(RN wins | opposition divided) ≈ 60%

P(RN wins Marseille) ≈ 0.95 × 0.35 × 0.60 ≈ 20%

Adding minimal probability for Lyon/Toulouse upsets: ~0.5%

**Final estimate: 20.5%**

## Probability Calibration

The outside view of 16.7% was based on historical failure rates across all three cities. Current evidence concentrates nearly all probability in Marseille, where RN is genuinely competitive for the first time. The 31% first-round polling is strong evidence, but the two-round system and coalition dynamics remain formidable barriers.

A 20% probability means 1-in-5 chance—this feels calibrated to the scenario where Marseille's opposition fails to unite effectively (plausible given four-way race) but acknowledges the strong historical pattern of anti-RN coalitions succeeding.

If I said 30%, I'd be betting that opposition division is more likely than not—unsupported by evidence. If I said 10%, I'd be ignoring the unprecedented polling strength. 20% captures "real chance but still unlikely."

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will RN win mayoralty in Marseille, Lyon, or Toulouse by 25 March 2026? (Official results determine resolution.)

2. **Base rate:** 16.7% from outside view (0/21 historical record, adjusted for national trends and current polling).

3. **Consistency:** "20 out of 100 times, RN wins at least one of these three mayoralties." This aligns with Marseille being genuinely competitive but facing structural barriers, while Lyon/Toulouse are non-viable.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Marseille polls: RN at 31%, tied for first (strong, multiple sources, Feb 2026)
   - Lyon/Toulouse: RN at 8-9%, below 10% threshold (strong, multiple sources)
   - Two-round system historically produces anti-RN coalitions (strong, structural)
   - Four-way Marseille race increases coalition failure risk (moderate)
   - Only 4 weeks remaining limits dramatic shifts (moderate)

5. **Blind spot:** A major scandal involving Payan or Vassal in final weeks could fragment opposition and hand Marseille to RN. This could push probability to 35-40%.

6. **Status quo:** Current trajectory is RN qualifying for Marseille second round but losing to united opposition. Slight nudge toward status quo suggests 19-20% range is appropriate.

**Probability: 20%**
