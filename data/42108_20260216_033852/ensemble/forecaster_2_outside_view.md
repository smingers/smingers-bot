Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles:**

1. **Statista (2020 Marseille results)**: Limited utility - references 2020 data but doesn't provide actual vote shares. Low information value.

2. **Jacobin (Feb 2020)**: Pre-2020 election analysis. Notes RN won 2019 European elections in Marseille but focuses on left coalition. Factual on electoral mechanics but speculative on outcomes. Historical context only.

3. **Fifth-and-a-Half Republic (July 2020)**: Post-2020 election analysis. **Key fact: RN took 19% first round, 20% second round in Marseille 2020** - eliminated, no seats won. Documents RN's consistent failure to break through. High-quality retrospective analysis.

4. **La Dépêche (Jan 21-22, 2026)**: **Critical source - most recent polling data**:
   - Marseille: Ipsos poll (Jan 12, 2026) shows **Franck Allisio (RN) tied at 30%** with Payan (left)
   - Lyon: OpinionWay (Dec 2025) shows **Dupalais (RN) at 10%**, trailing Aulas (46%) and Doucet (25%)
   - Toulouse: Cluster 17 (Nov 2025) shows **RN at 10%**, trailing Moudenc (33%) and Briançon (30%)
   
   High credibility - named polling firms with sample sizes and dates.

5. **Le Parisien (Feb 11, 2026)**: Toulouse-specific. Cluster 17/Politico poll shows Moudenc 34%, Briançon 32%, Piquemal (LFI) 19%. **No mention of RN candidate**. Recent but incomplete.

6. **TF1 INFO (Feb 12, 2026)**: **Most recent general overview**. Lists RN targets (Toulon, Carcassonne, etc.) but **explicitly does not list Marseille, Lyon, or Toulouse as potential RN victories**. Notes Lyon could flip to center-right (not RN). High credibility national news source.

**Agent Report:**

Comprehensive historical analysis with strong documentation:
- **No RN/FN mayor ever in these three cities**
- Marseille historical: 22.6% (1995), 22% (2014 sector win), ~8% (2020)
- Lyon historical: Never qualified for second round under PLM law; 0 councillors since 2008
- Toulouse historical: Peaked at 7.1% (2014), 4.3% (2020)
- 2026 polling synthesis matches web sources: Marseille competitive (31%), Lyon/Toulouse non-competitive (8-10%)

Quality assessment: Agent report aligns with and extends web sources, providing crucial historical baseline.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **RN performance in major French cities (>200k pop) in municipal elections**: Most relevant. RN has won only smaller cities (Perpignan ~120k, Fréjus ~54k). Never won a top-10 city. Success rate in major cities: ~0-2%.

2. **RN performance specifically in Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse historically**: Highly specific. Shows structural weakness:
   - Marseille: Best result 22.6% (1995), one sector win (2014), eliminated 2020
   - Lyon: Never qualified for round 2 since 1983
   - Toulouse: Never above 8%, eliminated every cycle
   - Success rate: 0/3 cities × 8 election cycles = 0/24

3. **Far-right breakthrough in traditionally resistant cities**: Broader European context. Some breakthroughs occur (e.g., AfD in eastern German cities) but typically in cities with prior far-right strength, not virgin territory.

**Most suitable reference class**: #2 (city-specific historical performance) combined with #1 (RN major city track record). The 40-year pattern of failure in these specific cities, plus RN's inability to win any comparable-sized city, provides the strongest baseline.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 37 days (Feb 16 to March 25, 2026). Elections March 15 (round 1) and March 22 (round 2).

**Historical patterns over similar periods (final 6-8 weeks before election):**
- French municipal polling typically stabilizes 2-3 months out
- Two-round system creates strategic dynamics: first-round leaders often lose in round 2 due to republican front (anti-RN coalitions)
- 2020 Marseille: RN maintained ~19-20% through both rounds but gained no ground
- 2014 Marseille: RN peaked in round 1, then contained in round 2
- Historical pattern: **When RN reaches round 2, center-left-right coalitions form to block them**

## (d) Justification

**Marseille** presents the only plausible scenario:
- Unprecedented polling position: 30-31% (vs. historical peak 22.6%)
- But: La Dépêche scenarios show even in best case (quadrangular), Allisio loses 42-43%
- If Delogu withdraws: 45-55% against Allisio
- Two-round system historically lethal to RN: 1995 triangulaire contained them, 2014 sector-level wins didn't translate citywide
- TF1 INFO (most recent strategic analysis) doesn't list Marseille as likely RN win

**Lyon**: 10% polling, never qualified for round 2 in 40 years, trailing by 34+ points. Structurally impossible.

**Toulouse**: 8-10% polling, historical ceiling 7.1%, never competitive. Structurally impossible.

**Key factors:**
1. Base rate: 0/24 historical attempts (0%)
2. Polling shows only Marseille remotely competitive, but second-round dynamics favor incumbents
3. French electoral system specifically designed to contain far-right through coalitions
4. Expert assessment (TF1) doesn't predict RN victory in any of the three cities
5. Time remaining (37 days) insufficient for 20+ point swings needed in Lyon/Toulouse

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring considerations:**
- Historical base rate: 0% (0/24 attempts)
- Current polling suggests Marseille has ~15-20% chance based on scenarios (42-45% in best cases, but those require specific coalition failures)
- Lyon/Toulouse: <1% each based on polling and structural barriers
- Combined probability: Primarily driven by Marseille

**Calibration factors:**
1. Polling uncertainty: ±3-4 points typical, but 31% vs 31% tie could swing either way
2. Second-round dynamics: Historically devastating to RN (reduces probability)
3. Unprecedented RN strength nationally (2024 legislative near-win): Increases probability slightly
4. Republican front tradition: Strong but showing cracks (increases probability slightly)
5. Multiple cities (3 attempts vs 1): Increases probability modestly

**Probability estimation:**
- Marseille alone: 12-18% chance (polling competitive but second-round dynamics unfavorable)
- Lyon: 0.5% (would require 35+ point swing)
- Toulouse: 0.5% (would require 25+ point swing)
- Combined (at least one): ~13-19%

**Upset rate consideration**: French municipal elections see occasional upsets, but RN specifically has been blocked consistently. The 2022 presidential runoff (Macron 58-42 over Le Pen) and 2024 legislative results (RN won plurality but not majority) show RN can reach ~40-45% but struggles to break 50%. This suggests the 42-45% ceiling in Marseille scenarios is realistic.

**Final calibration**: Given the unprecedented polling strength in Marseille offset by historical containment patterns and unfavorable second-round scenarios, plus negligible chances in Lyon/Toulouse, I estimate 14-16% as the appropriate range.
