Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Resolves “Yes” if official 2026 municipal results show the winning mayoral list in at least one of Marseille, Lyon, or Toulouse is labeled/nuanced RN on the Interior Ministry site (or other credible sources).

2) Outside view base rate
Outside view baseline previously established: 15%.

(a) Source analysis (what each source says + quality/date)
- Franceinfo (Feb 15, 2026) “51 villes…”: High-quality mainstream outlet; mostly descriptive + some qualitative framing. Key factual item: Marseille RN candidate Franck Allisio “buoyed by good polling”; confirms Marseille is a top RN target. Doesn’t add much on Lyon/Toulouse in the excerpt.
- Le Parisien (Feb 7, 2026) polling map: High value because it reports city polling with numbers. Credible national paper; exact pollster/method details not fully in excerpt but treated as a reputable compilation. Key facts: Marseille Payan 31 / Allisio (RN) 31; Lyon RN list 9% (near 10% threshold); Toulouse RN Leonardelli 8%.
- France Inter (Feb 2, 2026) political editorial: Reputable public radio, but this is commentary. Useful mainly for “expert vibe” that Marseille RN win would be an “earthquake,” i.e., still seen as unlikely/exceptional.
- 20 Minutes (Feb 14, 2026): Mixed outlet; here it’s a fact-check. The key election-relevant factual claim is that Payan and Allisio are “neck and neck” in Marseille polls; otherwise focuses on homicide-rate dispute.
- Le Figaro (Jan 22, 2026): Credible paper; reports Bardella’s stated ambitions (“several dozen communes”) and highlights Marseille as a major objective. This is partisan intent, not probability evidence.
- Franceinfo (Feb 12, 2026) Marseille 2nd-round stance: High-quality. Key factual quote: Martine Vassal says she will maintain in the second round and refuses alliances; also repeats late-Jan poll (31/31/20/14). Candidate statements are not binding, but are real constraints/signals.
- Franceinfo (Feb 15, 2026) new voting system logistics: High-quality but mostly administrative. Confirms a reformed ballot structure in Marseille (and extra ballot in Lyon). Mechanically relevant but directionally ambiguous.
- HuffPost (Feb 15, 2026) polls map: Secondary aggregator; useful as corroboration that (i) Marseille is competitive, (ii) Lyon has a clear non-RN favorite. Less weight than primary poll reporting.
- CNEWS / other broad “parties align” pieces (Feb 14-15, 2026): Lower analytic rigor; mostly narrative that RN is pushing hard locally. Weak incremental signal.
- La Dépêche (Feb 14, 2026) Toulouse campaign “confidentiels”: Local paper; mostly campaign color. It indirectly confirms the top-three dynamic in Toulouse (Moudenc vs left) with RN not central.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence
- Multiple independent mentions + polling convergence that Marseille is effectively tied at ~31% between Payan and RN’s Allisio (Le Parisien; Franceinfo; 20 Minutes). This materially increases RN’s “path exists” compared to the historical reference class.
- Structural: two-round list system + possibility of multi-way second round where a plurality can secure the majority bonus (institutionally hard to change in the remaining month). If a stable quadrangular persists, RN can win without reaching 50% of votes.

Moderate evidence
- Vassal publicly committing to remain in round 2 and refusing alliances (Franceinfo Feb 12). If credible/maintained, it raises RN odds by sustaining vote-splitting on the anti-RN side. Counterpoint: commitments can unravel under pressure (“front républicain” dynamics).
- Lyon and Toulouse polling puts RN below/near the 10% qualification threshold (Le Parisien). This strongly suggests RN is unlikely to even be in winning position there.

Weak evidence
- “Earthquake” framing (France Inter) and RN national ambition statements (Le Figaro). These inform expectations but don’t quantify local vote transfers.
- Administrative reform logistics (Franceinfo Feb 15) could slightly change turnout/valid ballots/coordination, but direction is unclear.

Key implication for the resolution criterion (label risk)
- Lyon’s RN-adjacent list is described as “UDR-RN” in Le Parisien; even in a hypothetical upset, labeling on the Interior Ministry site might not be purely RN. This further reduces the already-tiny Lyon contribution to “Yes.”
- In Toulouse, an 8% RN score implies: (i) likely no round-2 presence (if <10%), and (ii) even a merger (if >5%) would usually not produce an RN-labeled winning list—so Toulouse is close to irrelevant for “Yes” unless RN itself surges.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left: ~37 days to resolution (election rounds March 15 & 22; resolves March 25).
- If timeframe halved (~18 days): less time for major opinion shifts; Marseille tie would become more informative, slightly increasing confidence in “some RN chance,” but also less time for scandals/withdrawals to change second-round configurations.
- If timeframe doubled (~74 days): more opportunity for coordination (“anti-RN” convergence), candidate replacement, or late campaign shocks; I’d slightly reduce the probability vs today because coalition/strategic adjustments have more time to materialize.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from 15% base rate)
Status quo if nothing changed: RN does not win any of the three; Lyon/Toulouse remain non-RN, Marseille decided among left vs traditional right with RN blocked in round 2.

Why move off the base rate at all?
- The outside-view reference class was dominated by (i) RN’s historical failure in these exact cities and (ii) RN’s near-zero performance in Lyon/Toulouse. That still holds.
- What is non-analogous now: Marseille polling has RN tied for first in first-round intentions (~31%), repeatedly reported across sources. That is a qualitatively different starting point than past cycles where RN was well behind or eliminated.

Mechanisms to “Yes” (mostly Marseille)
- RN wins Marseille if: (1) RN remains first/competitive after round 1, (2) second round remains 3–4-way (limited withdrawals/mergers), and (3) RN leads the second round by a few points, gaining the majority bonus and thus the mayoralty. Vassal’s stated refusal to ally/withdraw increases the plausibility of (2).

Mechanisms to “No”
- “Front” dynamics: one major list withdraws/merges explicitly to stop RN, producing a clearer one-on-one in round 2 where RN historically underperforms.
- RN underperforms its poll number due to turnout differential, candidate quality, or late consolidation against RN.

Net effect
- Lyon/Toulouse remain effectively ~0–1% each for an RN-labeled mayoralty due to low polling and qualification/label constraints.
- Marseille is now the driver; the tie at ~31% plus credible multi-way runoff risk pushes Marseille RN-win probability upward vs the 12–18% range implied in the outside view writeup, but “earthquake” expectations and typical second-round blocking keep it well below 50%.

Probability calibration
- I decompose as:
  - P(RN wins Marseille) ≈ 21%
  - P(RN wins Lyon) ≈ 0.3% (requires massive surge + label would likely be ambiguous)
  - P(RN wins Toulouse) ≈ 0.7% (requires major surge from ~8% and then winning as RN-labeled list)
- Combined: 1 − (0.79 * 0.997 * 0.993) ≈ 22%.

This is a modest upward revision from 15% driven almost entirely by repeated polling showing Marseille as a genuine coin-flip-for-first in round 1 and a credible vote-splitting second-round environment.

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: “Yes if an RN-labeled winning mayoral list is official in Marseille, Lyon, or Toulouse in March 2026 municipal results.”
2) Outside view base rate: 15%.
3) Consistency check: “22 out of 100 times, an RN-labeled list wins the mayoralty in at least one of Marseille/Lyon/Toulouse.” Plausible given Marseille competitiveness but strong historical blocking.
4) Top evidence (<=20 words each):
   - Marseille polls repeatedly show Payan 31% and RN Allisio 31%.
   - Vassal says she will stay in round 2; refusal of alliances sustains multi-way runoff risk.
   - Lyon RN ~9% and Toulouse RN ~8%, both below/near qualification threshold.
   - Historical pattern: RN struggles to assemble majority support in big-city runoffs.
5) Blind spot: sudden elite coordination/withdrawal producing a clean anti-RN duel in Marseille (would cut probability materially).
6) Status quo outcome: RN wins none; modest nudge away from status quo justified by Marseille tie polls.

Probability: 22%
