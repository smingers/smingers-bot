Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most weight-bearing first)

1. Le Parisien, 7 Feb 2026 – Fresh city-level poll using national pollster Cluster 17; transparent methodology; reliable mainstream outlet; data only nine days old.  → strong factual signal.

2. Franceinfo, 12 Feb 2026 – Follow-up interview quoting the same Marseille poll and a public statement from Martine Vassal that she “will stay in the second round”. Current, first-hand quotes.  → strong for intentions, moderate for numbers (re-cites earlier poll).

3. 20 Minutes, 14 Feb 2026 – Crime-fact-check story confirming Payan–Allisio “neck-and-neck”; outlet is reputable but the poll is again a reiteration.  → moderate corroboration.

4. Le HuffPost interactive map, 15 Feb 2026 – Compilation of 75 polls; gives 34 %/32 %/19 %/8 % figures for Toulouse and confirms 44.5 %/30 %/9 % (RN) for Lyon.  → moderate factual value, good for cross-validation.

5. Franceinfo “51 villes à surveiller”, 15 Feb 2026 – Lists confirmed RN candidate names; descriptive.  → weak-to-moderate, mostly colour.

6. Le Figaro interview with Jordan Bardella, 22 Jan 2026 – Party ambition statement; useful for motivation but opinion-driven.  → weak evidence.

7. France Inter editorial, 2 Feb 2026 – Analytical opinion on ‘triple Mediterranean bingo’.  → weak (op-ed).

Historical context sources (Jacobin 2020; Fifth-and-a-Half Republic 2020; Statista 2020) – establish that RN has never held these three cities.  → strong historical evidence.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong evidence
• 2026 polls in Marseille show RN list at 31 % and certain to qualify for round 2 (Le Parisien + Franceinfo).  
• Structural rule: with ≥10 % any list can stay in round 2; no obligation to withdraw (electoral code).  
• Historical pattern: RN/FN zero mayoralties in Marseille, Lyon, Toulouse across ten cycles (1983-2020).

Moderate evidence
• Vassal publicly says she “will not withdraw”; increases chance of a four-way runoff that fragments anti-RN vote.  
• RN share in Lyon (9 %) and Toulouse (8 %) is close to, but still below, the 10 % threshold – tail possibility.  
• Opinion surveys show diminishing “cordon sanitaire” among LR voters (Ifop Jan-2026: 62 % LR supporters accept alliance with RN).

Weak evidence
• Bardella rhetoric about ‘several dozen communes’.  
• Editorial speculation about “earthquake” scenarios.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Days until first round: 28. Days until second round (and resolution): 35.  
If the window were halved (to one week before voting) I would wait for final polls and candidate withdrawals; variance would fall and I would move 3-4 pp toward whichever side the late polls favoured.  
If doubled (10 weeks) structural factors dominate and I would lean 2-3 pp back toward the status-quo (No) because longer campaigns usually re-erect anti-RN fronts.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base rate (municipal cycles since 1983) = 6–7 % for RN capturing ≥1 of the three cities (rule-of-succession on 0/30 trials).

Inside view:

1. Marseille pathway (≈90 % of event probability)  
   • RN certain to reach round 2 (≈95 %).  
   • Runoff format: 4-way quadrangulaire 60 % (Vassal + LFI stay), 3-way 40 % (some merger).  
   • Win odds conditional: 30 % in a 4-way (plurality around 32–35 % could suffice); 15 % in a 3-way (anti-RN consolidation stronger).  
   → 0.95 × [0.60 × 0.30 + 0.40 × 0.15] ≈ 24 %.

2. Lyon pathway  
   • RN at 9 % polling, needs +1 pp to qualify. Give 25 % chance to clear threshold, then 5 % chance to win a three-way (even if it did).  
   → 0.25 × 0.05 ≈ 1 %.

3. Toulouse pathway  
   • RN at 8 %, same reasoning but slightly weaker right base: 20 % × 4 % ≈ 0.8 %.

Add small 1 % for extreme shocks (terror attack, corruption scandal) helping RN elsewhere.  
Total ≈ 27 %.  I round down slightly to reflect poll error and historic over-statement of RN in municipal seconds rounds.

Probability calibration
Final inside-view estimate: 22  % (≈1 chance in 5).

Checklist:
1. Will an RN-labelled list win the mayoralty of at least one of Marseille, Lyon or Toulouse by March 25 2026?  
2. Base rate used: 6.7 %.  
3. “22 out of 100 times, the RN wins at least one of the three mayoralties.”  
4. Key evidence: a) Marseille polls tie at 31 %. b) Vassal vows to stay -> likely 4-way runoff. c) Historic zero RN wins in these cities. d) RN polling <10 % in Lyon/Toulouse.  
5. Blind-spot: Last-minute LR–RN alliance or large scandal hitting Payan could spike RN vote to 40 %+; would raise probability toward 40 %.  
6. Status-quo (No) still more likely; short timeline and institutional anti-RN fronts usually hold.

Probability: 22%
