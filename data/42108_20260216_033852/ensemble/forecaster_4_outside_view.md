Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Statista (2020 vote shares, Marseille): Factual, numeric site behind paywall, but the extracted text contains no figures; limited utility beyond confirming RN did not win in 2020.  
2. Jacobin (Feb 2020): Opinion-heavy left-wing magazine. Factual nuggets: RN topped the 2019 European election in Marseille; otherwise descriptive, dated.  
3. Fifth-and-a-Half Republic blog (Jul 2020): Narrative summary of 2020 municipal results. Gives city-wide and sector results; blog quality, but figures match official totals. Useful historical facts, modest reliability.  
4. La Dépêche du Midi (21 Jan 2026): Main-stream regional daily summarising Ipsos, Opinion Way and Cluster 17 polls. Fresh, professional polling data; high factual value, clearly separated from commentary.  
5. Le Parisien (11 Feb 2026): National paper describing a Toulouse poll by Cluster 17. Recent, reputable; small sample but credible.  
6. TF1 Info (12 Feb 2026): Major TV newsroom. Lists RN target towns and omits the three cities in question. Mostly commentary but from political journalists—moderate weight.  
7. Agent report (internal synthesis, Feb 2026): Compiles official first-round results 1983-2020 and current polls. Useful aggregation but secondary; figures traceable to Ministry of Interior and polling firms; treat as provisional pending primary-source check.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
1. RN (and predecessor FN) performance in the 3 target cities across all municipal elections since the PLM law (1983–2020): 0 wins in 21 contests.  
2. RN performance in all French cities >200 000 inhabitants in 2020 elections: 0 wins out of ~15.  
3. RN performance in all French municipalities nationwide in 2020: ≈10 mayoralties out of ~35 000 (<0.05 %).  
Class 1 is most tailored (same electorates, same two-round PLM system), so I use it.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today: 16 Feb 2026. First round: 15 Mar (≈4 weeks). Second round: 22 Mar (≈5 weeks). Historically, polls in large French cities move only a few points in the last month; decisive changes arise mainly from inter-round alliances rather than opinion swings. The two-round system usually sees anti-RN coalitions coalesce and hold when RN is below ~35 % first-round support.

(d) Justification  
Base-rate record (0/21) puts an a-priori probability near zero, but complete certainty is unwarranted. I place a Beta(1,22) conjugate prior on “RN wins a mayoralty in one of the three cities in a given cycle”. Mean = 1 / 23 ≈ 4.3 % per city. Assuming independence (an approximation—the cities’ politics are largely separate) yields:

P(no win) ≈ (1 − 0.043)³ ≈ 0.885  
P(at least one win) ≈ 11.5 %

Adjustments to the base rate:  
+ National RN vote share has risen from 41 % in the 2024 European elections and ~35 % in 2025 regional polling, suggesting structural growth (+2  pp).  
+ Marseille 2026 polls show RN at ~30 % and tied for first—a qualitatively stronger position than ever before (+3 pp).  
− Lyon and Toulouse polling places RN at or below the 10 % access threshold, so their individual odds remain near baseline (−1 pp).  
+ Five weeks remain; last-minute scandals or strategic withdrawals occasionally swing a city (roughly one upset of this magnitude per 20 large-city run-offs, ≈5 % extra odds) (+1 pp).

Net outside-view probability ≈ 11.5 % + (2 + 3 − 1 + 1) = 16.5 %  
I round very slightly for clarity but avoid multiples of five.

Outside view calibration:
• Anchor: 0/21 historical wins → 11–12 % chance (formula above).  
• Up-rating factors: national trend, unprecedented Marseille polling competitiveness, generic upset frequency.  
• Down-rating factors: two-round “Republican front” still robust, weak RN presence in Lyon/Toulouse.  
• Result: 16–17 % feels consistent with past forecasting accuracy for similar French municipal questions.

Outside View Prediction:
16.7 %
