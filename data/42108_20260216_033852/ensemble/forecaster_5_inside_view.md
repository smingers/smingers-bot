Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most weight-bearing first)

1. Franceinfo, 12 Feb 2026 – national public broadcaster, hard news.  Late-January Ifop poll for Marseille (Allisio /RN 31 %, Payan /Left 31 %, four-way second round).  High methodological transparency → strong factual value, very recent.

2. Le Parisien, 7 Feb 2026 – large national daily citing cluster of February polls for the ten biggest cities.  Gives identical 31 %-31 % tie in Marseille, 9 % RN in Lyon, 8 % RN in Toulouse.  Good pollster pedigree (Ipsos, Cluster 17).  Strong evidence, corroborates #1.

3. Franceinfo, 15 Feb 2026 (list of 51 cities) – confirms Allisio’s momentum; still no RN traction in Lyon/Toulouse.  Same newsroom as #1, one day old, moderate corroborative weight.

4. 20 Minutes, 14 Feb 2026 – local fact-check about Allisio’s crime statements.  Secondary but useful: again calls the race “neck-and-neck” → weak-to-moderate support.

5. France Inter editorial, 2 Feb 2026 – senior political columnist: RN “can dream of a Mediterranean triple, Marseille would be an earthquake”.  Expert opinion, moderate weight.

6. Le Figaro, 22 Jan 2026 – interview Bardella; party sets Marseille as top target.  Primary source on RN strategy; moderate weight (reveals motivation, not votes).

7. All remaining AskNews items – background pieces, older (Dec 2025 – Jan 2026); echo the same poll numbers.  Weak incremental value.

No reliable source contradicts the polling consensus; dates are ≤ 3 weeks old.

(b) Evidence analysis (using weighting rubric)

Strong evidence
• Two independent polls (Franceinfo/Ifop and Le Parisien/Cluster 17) showing Allisio on 31 % and clearly qualified for round 2 in Marseille.  
• Structural electoral rule: in a four-way runoff the leading list only needs a plurality; Marseille’s PLM law grants a 25 % council bonus ➜ a first-place plurality can translate into the mayoralty.

Moderate evidence
• Public declaration by Martine Vassal (#1, #3) that she “will stay in” for the second round, implying a likely quadrangulaire that splits the anti-RN vote.  
• Historic precedent 2020 Perpignan (RN won a 120 k city), indicating barriers are weakening but still unusual.  
• Expert commentary (#5) stressing that Marseille would be exceptional but not impossible.

Weak evidence
• RN polling <10 % in Lyon and Toulouse – useful mainly to down-weight those cities.  
• Bardella aspirations (#6) – reveals intentions, not capacity.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until first round: 27.  35 days until the mayor is elected (second-round council vote 22–23 Mar).  Poll error and campaign shocks usually shrink, not widen, inside the last month unless a list withdraws/merges.  If only half this time remained I would trim 1-2 pp; if doubled I would widen the uncertainty band ±3 pp but keep the mean similar.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment from the 13 % outside base

Step 1 – City-by-city priors (Laplace rule, ref-class 1983-2020)  
P₀(Marseille)=4.3 %; P₀(Lyon)=4.3 %; P₀(Toulouse)=4.3 %.

Step 2 – Incorporate 2026 polling & candidate field  

• Marseille  
   – RN certain to qualify (poll 31 %).  
   – Vassal publicly vows no withdrawal; probability she still maintains after 1st round ≈ 50 %.  
   – If quadrangulaire: simulate vote flows (historic anti-RN leakage ~50 % to left when no fusion).  RN victory chance ≈ 40 % in that branch.  
   – If she withdraws/merges: RN win chance collapses to ≈ 5 %.  
   Posterior P(Marseille)=0.5 × 0.40 + 0.5 × 0.05 = 0.225 (22.5 %).

• Lyon  
   – RN at 9 %, just under 10 % bar.  Give 30 % chance to qualify; conditional win chance 1 %.  
   P(Lyon)=0.003 (0.3 %).

• Toulouse  
   – RN at 8 %, qualification 20 %; conditional win 0.5 %.  
   P(Toulouse)=0.001 (0.1 %).

Step 3 – At-least-one city  
P = 1 – (1 – 0.225)(1 – 0.003)(1 – 0.001) ≈ 0.24 (24 %).

Round to nearest whole number ➜ 25 %.

This more than doubles the 13 % outside view, justified by convergent, high-quality polls showing an unprecedented RN lead in Marseille under conditions (four-way runoff, low fusion discipline) that structurally favour plurality victories.

Probability calibration

I interpret “25 %” as: in roughly one out of four re-runs of March-2026 we would see an RN-labelled list emerge mayor in at least one of the three cities, overwhelmingly via Marseille.  Event probability is dominated (≈ 94 %) by Marseille; Lyon and Toulouse together add ~1 pp.

Checklist:

1. Paraphrase (<30 w):  By end-Mar 2026, will an official RN-labelled list capture the mayoralty of Marseille, Lyon or Toulouse?  

2. Outside base: 13 %.  Final 25 % remains anchored but adjusted for polling & runoff mechanics.  

3. Consistency line: “25 times out of 100, an RN list wins one of the three mayoralties.” – coherent with reasoning.  

4. Key evidence (≤20 w each)  
   a) Two February polls show RN 31 % tied for first in Marseille.  
   b) Vassal vows to stay, implying likely four-way runoff.  
   c) PLM 25 % bonus turns plurality into council majority.  
   d) RN below 10 % in Lyon & Toulouse, near-zero win odds.  

5. Blind-spot: Vassal withdraws post-1st-round under pressure, uniting anti-RN camp; RN vote stagnates → probability nearer 5 %.  

6. Status-quo tendency: Big-city RN failures 1983-2020 argue for caution; I resisted edging above 25 %.

Probability: 25%
