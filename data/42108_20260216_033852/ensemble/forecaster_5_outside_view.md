Analysis:  

(a) Source analysis  
1. Statista page (2020 Marseille vote shares).  
   • Factual: provides official 2020 second-round percentages.  
   • Quality: high for raw numbers, no interpretation. Dated mid-2020.  
   • Opinion content: none.  

2. Jacobin, Feb 2020 “Storming France’s City Halls”.  
   • Factual: explains French two-round municipal rules; reports RN topped 2019 European vote in Marseille.  
   • Quality: journalism with a left-wing slant; still reliable on descriptive electoral facts that are easily cross-checked.  
   • Opinion: mainly normative about prospects of the Left – ignored for base-rate building.  

3. Fifth-and-a-Half Republic blog, 6 Jul 2020.  
   • Factual: gives certified 2020 municipal results in Paris, Lyon, Marseille and notes RN 19-20 % in Marseille, no mayoralty.  
   • Quality: niche academic blog (Paul Smith, Univ. Nottingham). Credible on numbers, lightly opinionated narrative.  

4. La Dépêche du Midi, 21 Jan 2026 polling roundup.  
   • Factual: Ipsos/OpinionWay/Cluster 17 first-round polls for the three cities.  
   • Quality: mainstream regional daily; cites reputable French pollsters with sample size & field dates.  
   • Opinion: framing words like “historic duel” – ignored.  

5. Le Parisien, 11 Feb 2026 article on Toulouse LFI proposal.  
   • Factual: repeats Cluster 17 poll (RN 8-10 % in Toulouse).  
   • Quality: mainstream national paper.  

6. TF1-Info, 12 Feb 2026 “Cities that could flip”.  
   • Factual: lists RN target towns (none of the three studied).  
   • Quality: large national broadcaster, but article is a quick overview; still useful as an indicator of media expectations.  

7. Agent report (LLM synthesis of multiple press and official sources).  
   • Factual: long historical series of RN vote shares 1983-2020, list of declared 2026 heads of list, most recent polls.  
   • Quality: data points match Ministry-of-Interior archives and published polls I spot-checked; uncertainty flags on missing exact percentages are honest.  
   • Opinion: none; strictly descriptive.  

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. RN (formerly FN) performance in Marseille/Lyon/Toulouse 1983-2020.  
2. RN performance in all French cities >200 000 inhabitants 1983-2020.  
3. Far-right (RN or equivalent) winning executive control of any EU city >500 000 since 1980.  

Class 1 is the most specific and data-rich for the exact outcome we care about; it captures structural handicaps (sociology of big cities, two-round fusion dynamics) better than broader classes. I therefore adopt class 1 for the outside view, cross-checking with class 2 for sanity.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today: 16 Feb 2026.  
• First municipal round: 15 Mar 2026; second round: 22 Mar 2026. Results certified before 25 Mar 2026. → ≈ 5 weeks to event.  
Historical pattern: vote shares in French municipals move only a few percentage points in the last month; dramatic reversals are rare because alliances are negotiated in the six days between rounds, not in opinion-poll swing. Upsets of the type “non-frontrunner wins a large city outright” have happened (e.g., Perpignan 2020) but remain exceptional.  

(d) Justification for the outside-view number  
Base-rate calculation (reference class 1):  
• Seven municipal cycles since the PLM law (1983, -89, -95, 2001, -08, -14, -20) × 3 cities = 21 opportunities.  
• RN/FN mayoral victories in those 21 cases: 0.  
Using Laplace rule of succession: (0 + 1) / (21 + 2) = 1 / 23 ≈ 4.3 % chance that RN wins a given city in any new cycle under similar conditions.  

Probability of “at least one of the three” if city outcomes were independent:  
P = 1 – (1 – 0.043)³ ≈ 12.5 %.  
Independence is imperfect: success in one big city would probably reflect a national wave that also lifts odds elsewhere, so correlation should raise the combined probability slightly. On the other hand, the structural barriers (need for 50 % of seats in council, broad anti-RN coalitions) operate similarly across the three cities, which keeps the overall chance low.  

Adjustments to the raw 12.5 % base:  
+ 3 pp for RN’s higher national ceiling in 2026 (polling ~30 % nationally vs ~17 % in 2014) and the party’s recent capture of Perpignan, signalling that previous “big-city impossible” barrier is weakening.  
– 2 pp for the entrenched left-/centrist dominance in Lyon and Toulouse where RN has not even crossed the 10 % qualifying threshold since 2001.  
Net outside-view estimate ≈ 13.5 %.  

Expert/market priors: no published prediction markets yet, but mainstream commentators (TF1-Info) do not list these cities among likely RN pickups—consistent with a single-digits to low-teens probability and supports staying close to the base-rate figure.  

Outside view calibration:  

(a) We want the true probability, not a “hedged” figure.  
(b) Laplace-adjusted frequency (4–5 %) per city is our anchor.  
(c) Upsets like Perpignan show that low-probability events (≈10 %) do occur; I therefore resist going below 10 %.  
(d) Historical upset rate among French municipal contests for major cities (population >100 k) in 2020: 1 RN upset in roughly 41 such cities ≈ 2.4 %. This again argues for a modest, not huge, upward revision.  

Balancing these, I set the outside-view probability that an RN-labelled list will secure the mayoralty of at least one of Marseille, Lyon or Toulouse in 2026 at:  

Outside View Prediction: 13 %
