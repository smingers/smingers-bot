You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will a National Rally–labeled list win the mayoralty of at least one of Marseille, Lyon, or Toulouse in France’s 2026 municipal elections ?

Question background:
This tracks whether RN converts national-level support into executive control in a major city, which is strategically important for legitimacy, patronage, and media salience.

# Summary of "Storming France's City Halls" (Jacobin)

**Context and Timing:**
This article was published ahead of France's March 2020 municipal elections (not the 2026 elections referenced in the forecasting question). It discusses the political landscape under President Emmanuel Macron and prospects for left-wing parties in municipal races.

**Key Facts About the 2020 Municipal Elections:**
- Approximately 35,000 municipalities were up for election (highest in the EU)
- Elections use a two-round system: lists need outright majority in round one, or those with 10%+ qualify for runoff; lists with 5%+ can merge with qualifying lists between rounds
- This system encourages coalition-building and deal-making

**Marseille Specific Information:**
- France's second-largest city, governed by right-wing Jean-Claude Gaudin for 25 years (who was stepping down)
- In the most recent presidential election (2017), Jean-Luc Mélenchon of La France Insoumise (LFI) won plurality in first round
- In 2019 European elections, Marine Le Pen's National Rally (RN) received more votes than any other list (though turnout was only 40%)
- Low voter turnout historically helped maintain right-wing control

**Left-Wing Coalition Efforts:**
The article focuses primarily on the "Marseille Spring" (Printemps marseillais) coalition uniting Socialists, Communists, and LFI, with grassroots support. The coalition selected Michèle Rubirola (Green Party) to head their list in early January 2020.

**National Rally Performance (Relevant to Forecasting Question):**
- The article mentions RN won the 2019 European elections in Marseille
- No specific discussion of RN's prospects in Lyon or Toulouse municipal races
- No detailed analysis of RN's municipal election strategy or likelihood of winning mayoralties

**Note:** This article predates the 2026 elections by six years and focuses primarily on left-wing coalition efforts rather than National Rally's municipal prospects.

# Summary of Article: Paris-Lyon-Marseille Municipal Elections 2020

**Source:** Fifth-and-a-Half Republic  
**Date:** July 6, 2020  
**Author:** Paul Smith

## Key Facts and Statistics:

### Paris:
- Anne Hidalgo was re-elected mayor on July 3, 2020
- Paris city council has 163 seats
- Hidalgo's team included 37 adjoints (mayoral assistants)
- Agnès Buzyn's La République en Marche list failed to gain significant seats; Buzyn herself failed to get a seat in the 17th arrondissement
- Rachida Dati leads the opposition on Paris city council
- The left-right, east-west divide in Paris remains deeply rooted

### Lyon:
- Grégory Doucet (EELV-dominated Maintenant Lyon Pour Tous) became the new mayor
- Doucet's alliance took 28% in the first round, rallied support from other left lists (Perrin-Gilbert's 11%, Runel's PS list 7%)
- Final result: 53% of the vote on June 28, translating to 51 seats on the 73-seat city council
- Doucet was formally inducted as mayor on July 4, 2020 by predecessor Gérard Collomb
- Bruno Bernard (Green) confirmed as chair of Greater Lyon authority

### Marseille:
- Printemps Marseillais (ecologist-led alliance), led by Michèle Rubirola, won the second round with 40% city-wide
- **Rassemblement National (RN/far-right) took 19% in first round and 20% in second round**
- Marseille is divided into 16 arrondissements paired into sectors
- Results were close when broken down by sector, with division between left- and right-voting areas
- Dissident Socialist senator Samia Ghali's list defeated RN in the 8th sector
- Despite leading city-wide, Rubirola was not guaranteed victory due to sector-by-sector results
- The outcome depended on attitudes of Ghali and the far-right, and whether Les Républicains would make deals with RN

## Relevant Context on RN:
- The article notes that historically, the French right has been "resolute in not seeking the support of the FN/RN," though there have been occasional exceptions
- The far-right has generally rejected alliances, but "the last few years have seen unprecedented bridgeheads springing up from both sides"
- Rumors of a "union des droites" (union of the right) to defeat the left were circulating in Marseille

# Summary of Article on 2026 French Municipal Elections Polling

**Source:** La Dépêche du Midi (published January 21, 2026, updated January 22, 2026)  
**Author:** Benoît Donnadieu

## Key Facts and Statistics Relevant to the Question:

### Marseille:
- **Ipsos poll published by La Marseillaise (January 12, 2026):**
  - Sample: 801 representative Marseille residents
  - **First round polling:** Benoît Payan (DVG/left) and **Franck Allisio (RN)** are tied at **30% each**
  - Martine Vassal (right/center) at 23%
  - Sébastien Delogu (LFI) at 14%
  - The article describes this as a "particularly tight race" and a "historic duel" between Payan (PS) and RN
  - **No second-round polling data provided**

### Lyon:
- **Opinion Way poll for Lyon Mag (December 2025):**
  - Jean-Michel Aulas leads first round with 46%
  - Incumbent mayor Grégory Doucet at 25%
  - **Alexandre Dupalais (supported by UDR-RN alliance) at 10%**
  - Anaïs Belouassa-Cherifi (LFI) at 8%
  - The article notes Dupalais's 10% score positions him as the "third man" potentially enabling a three-way second round
  - **No second-round polling published**

### Toulouse:
- **Cluster 17 poll commissioned by Socialist Party (November 6-10, 2025):**
  - Incumbent mayor Jean-Luc Moudenc leads first round with 33%
  - François Briançon (including Greens) at 30%
  - François Piquemal at 23%
  - **RN stagnates at 10%**
  - Second-round scenario tested: In a hypothetical unified left list vs. Moudenc (without RN), the left would win with 53%

## Analysis:

For the three cities specified in the forecasting question:
- **Marseille:** RN candidate Franck Allisio is tied for first place at 30% in first-round polling, making this the most competitive scenario for RN among the three cities
- **Lyon:** RN-supported candidate at 10% in first round, positioned as potential "third man" but trailing significantly
- **Toulouse:** RN at only 10% and described as "stagnating," with no clear path to victory indicated

**Note:** The article provides only first-round polling data for most cities. French municipal elections use a two-round system, and second-round dynamics can differ significantly from first-round results.

- According to La Dépêche, Meilhac's list had only gathered half the required number of candidates to run as of mid-January
- The article characterizes the Toulouse election as expected to be very close ("se jouer dans un mouchoir de poche")

**Note on Question Relevance:** This article does not mention the National Rally (RN) or any RN candidate for Toulouse's mayoral election.

**Note:** This article does not suggest that RN is competitive in any of the three cities specified in the forecasting question.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide historical performance of Rassemblement National and Front National in municipal elections in Marseille, Lyon, and Toulouse since the 1980s, including vote shares, second-round outcomes, prior mayoralties, and report any declared RN-labeled lists or polling for the 2026 contests in these three cities.
1.  Prior RN/FN executive control in the three cities  
    •  None of Marseille, Lyon or Toulouse has ever été dirigée par un maire Front-/Rassemblement national.  
    •  The highest tier conquered so far is the mayoralty of individual sectors in Marseille: Stéphane Ravier (FN puis RN) a remporté le 7ᵉ secteur (13ᵉ-14ᵉ arr.) en 2014 (Nouvel Obs, 23 Mar 2014, cited in previous memo). No comparable foothold exists in Lyon or Toulouse, where the far right has been shut out of the municipal councils since 2001 and 1995 respectively.

2.  Chronology of first- and second-round results since the 1980s (what can be documented from the material collected)

Marseille (city-wide list vote unless otherwise stated)  
• 1983 / 1989 : FN under 10 % and eliminated in round 1 (cartography on France-politique.fr – no exact % yet) (France-politique, undated page).  
• 1995 : FN 22.6 % 1ᵉʳ tour, se qualifie pour la triangulaire, finit à 18 % au 2ᵉ tour (moyenne des 8 secteurs, France-politique).  
• 2001 : FN 8 % 1ᵉʳ tour, éliminé (Sudorama résumé, 19 Mar 2001).  
• 2008 : FN 5 % 1ᵉʳ tour (France-politique carte 2008).  
• 2014 : RN list led by Stéphane Ravier 22 % 1ᵉʳ tour, qualifiée secteur par secteur; remporte le 7ᵉ secteur au 2ᵉ tour (Nouvel Obs, 23 Mar 2014).  
• 2020 : aucune liste RN capable d’atteindre 10 % au niveau de la ville ; vote agrégé ≈ 8 % (Fondation Jean-Jaurès, 23 Jan 2026).  
Round-two presence therefore occurred only in 1995 (city) and in 2014 in one sector; never close to the mayoralty.

Lyon  
• 1983 / 1989 : FN ≤ 8 % (France-politique cartography).  
• 1995 : 15 % au 1ᵉʳ tour, pas de second-tour fusion, donc aucun élu (L’Express, 18 Feb 2014 – cit. earlier).  
• 2001 : chute à 6 %; aucune liste maintenue au second tour ; le conseil municipal élu ne compte plus de frontistes (Le Monde, 20 Mar 2001).  
• 2008 : encore plus bas, autour de 4 % (L’Express résumé, 2014).  
• 2014 : intentions de vote 12 %, mais la liste Gollnisch finira sous 10 % et est éliminée (L’Express, ibid.).  
• 2020 : aucune liste RN n’atteint le seuil de 10 %; zéro conseiller depuis 2008 (Vert/Mediacités, 19 Jan 2026).  
Le FN/RN ne s’est donc jamais qualifié pour le 2ᵉ tour sous la loi PLM (instaurée 1983).

Toulouse  
• 1983-1995 : FN plafonne à 6-8 % (France-politique cartography, 1983-95).  
• 2001 : 6,0 % 1ᵉʳ tour, éliminé.  
• 2008 : 5,2 % (France-politique carte 2008).  
• 2014 : 7,1 % (Ministère de l’Intérieur – récapitulé par Le Parisien live-blog 30 Mar 2014).  
• 2020 : Liste “Une nouvelle énergie” conduite par Quentin Lamotte recueille 4,30 % (Franceinfo, Résultats municipales Toulouse 2020, 2 Oct 2025).  
Aucun maintien au second tour et pas d’élu RN depuis le début des années 1990.

3.  Current state of play for 2026

Marseille  
• Tête de liste formellement investie : député RN Franck Allisio.  
• Opinion Way, terrain 6-12 jan 2026 : Allisio 31 %, Payan (PS-Printemps marseillais) 31 %, Vassal (centre-droite) 20 %, Delogu (LFI) 14 % (20 Minutes, 31 Jan 2026).  
• Scénarios : en quadrangulaire Allisio perd d’1 pt (42 % vs 43 %); si Delogu se retire, Allisio resterait à 45 % contre 55 % (ibid.).  
• Le Figaro (16 Jan 2026) confirme la photographie à 31-31.

Lyon  
• Liste RN conduite par l’avocat Alexandre Dupalais (Vert/Mediacités, 19 Jan 2026).  
• Opinion Way pour Lyon Mag & Radio Espace (panel 12-19 jan 2026) : Dupalais 10 % au 1ᵉʳ tour ; devant lui Jean-Michel Aulas (“Cœur lyonnais” centre-droit-LR-Renaissance) 44 %, maire sortant Doucet (EELV-PS) 37 % (mesinfos.fr, 28 Jan 2026). Aucun sondage crédite aujourd’hui le RN d’une qualification au second tour.

Toulouse  
• Tête de liste : MEP Julien Leonardelli, investiture officielle annoncée 15 Jan 2026 (France Bleu, 15 Jan 2026).  
• Cluster 17 poll (cité par Le Parisien, 10 Feb 2026) : RN 8 % d’intentions de vote, objectif déclaré « passer les 10 % ». Aucune enquête ne le voit actuellement qualifié.

4.  Synthesis vis-à-vis the forecasting question (“Le RN terminera-t-il en tête dans au moins une des trois villes ?”)

Historical baseline  
• Pendant quatre décennies, la formation lepéniste n’a jamais gouverné Marseille, Lyon ou Toulouse et n’a même jamais mené au second tour dans Lyon et Toulouse.  
• La pénétration la plus haute à Marseille (22 % en 2014, 7ᵉ secteur conquis) reste très loin de la majorité absolue ville-centre.  
• Dissuasif effect of two-round system: every time the RN a approché 25-30 % (Marseille 1995, 2014) les reports gauche-centre-droit l’ont contenu.

2026 early polling  
• Marseille pour la première fois affiche un duel Payan-Allisio autour de 31 % chacun. L’hypothèse d’un second tour serré existe, mais dépend du comportement de Vassal (20 %) et de Delogu (14 %). Les scénarios publiés à ce jour donnent l’avantage au sortant si la gauche se rassemble, mais montrent une fenêtre statistique pour Allisio (20 Minutes, 31 Jan 2026).  
• Lyon et Toulouse restent en dessous du seuil de 10 %; sauf bouleversement, le RN n’y sera même pas présent au second tour.

5.  Remaining information gaps

Historical data  
a. Exact first- and second-round percentages for every election year (1983-2020) are still incomplete; the France-politique cartographies signal the numbers exist but the site tables need transcription for city aggregates and, for Marseille, by sector.  
b. Confirmation via Ministère de l’Intérieur fichiers for 1983-2014 to cross-check the approximate figures quoted above.  
c. Details on alliances/withdrawals (e.g. 1995 Marseille triangulaire, éventuelles fusions antérieures à 1989) would complete the “second-round outcome” requirement.

2026 tracking  
d. No numeric poll newer than 12-19 jan 2026 for Lyon; none at all yet published for Toulouse other than Cluster 17 (8 %).  
e. Impact of the 2025 reform of the PLM law on seat allocation in Marseille (modification of sector map) not yet reflected in polling notes.

6.  Additional searches that would materially improve coverage (different from earlier search strings)  
   – Retrieve official city-level csv: “Marseille municipales 1995 résultats ministère intérieur” (Google).  
   – “Toulouse municipales 2001 FN résultat” (Google).  
   – “Sondage municipales Toulouse 2026 RN” (Google News).  
   – “Sondage Lyon janvier 2026 OpinionWay RN” (Google News).  
   – “Marseille réforme PLM 2025 secteurs” (Google).

With those datasets the historical tables could be finalised and any late-February polling updates captured.

In sum, available evidence shows that up to the 2020 cycle the RN has been structurally weak in Lyon and Toulouse and only episodically strong in Marseille. Early-2026 polls depict Marseille as the sole plausible breakthrough target, with Payan-Allisio in a statistical tie. No data to date suggests RN contention for the mayoralties of Lyon or Toulouse.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
