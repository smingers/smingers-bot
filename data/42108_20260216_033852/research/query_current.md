Analysis:
To assess RN’s chances we need up-to-date information on (1) who is heading RN-labeled lists in Marseille, Lyon, and Toulouse, (2) whether those lists have successfully filed and been accepted, (3) recent local polling or expert commentary on their competitiveness, and (4) any coalition or label changes that might cause the lists to be officially registered as RN on the Ministry of Interior site. Relevant articles are likely found in French political coverage of the 2026 municipales from national outlets (Le Monde, Le Figaro, Libération) and regional papers (La Provence, Lyon Capitale, La Dépêche du Midi). Searches should combine “RN” or “Rassemblement National” with each city and “municipales 2026”, “sondage”, “tête de liste”, etc.
