Analysis:
To assess RN’s chances in 2026 it helps to know (1) how the party and its predecessors have fared in past municipal elections in Marseille, Lyon, and Toulouse, particularly the 2020 cycle; (2) whether they have ever held the mayoralty or come close, and how many council seats they won; and (3) current 2026 candidate line-ups, alliances, and polls. Historical vote shares and second-round dynamics reveal structural ceilings or growth, while up-to-date news shows whether a strong RN-labeled list is emerging in any of the three cities.
