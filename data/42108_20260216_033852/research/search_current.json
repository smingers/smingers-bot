Under the new system, voters will cast two separate ballots on March 15 and 22, 2026: one for arrondissement mayors and councilors, and another for the central municipal council. To ensure clarity, Marseille has established a pilot polling station with two distinct tables\u2014one with brown envelopes and ballots for the central city hall, and another with blue envelopes and ballots for the arrondissement councils. According to Marie H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Caire, director of the city\u2019s election department, voters follow a clear, natural path: they vote at one table, proceed to a booth, then repeat the process at the second table. The goal is to eliminate confusion. Agents are undergoing training to ensure smooth operations, with one agent, Robert, noting the need for strong pedagogy. In Lyon, voters will also cast a third ballot for metropolitan councilors. The reform marks a significant shift from the previous system, which involved voting for lists of arrondissement councilors who then elected the mayor.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 10:19 AM\nSource:[Franceinfo](https://www.franceinfo.fr/elections/municipales-2026-marseille-se-prepare-pour-le-nouveau-mode-de-scrutin-et-forme-ses-agents_7805963.html)\n\n**One Month Before the First Round: All Municipal Polls Compiled in a Map**\nThe first round of the 2026 French municipal elections is set for March 15, 2026, exactly one month from the publication date of the article. With the national budget finalized in early February, political attention has fully shifted to the upcoming elections, which will determine mayors for France\u2019s 35,000 communes over the next six years. Candidates have already been campaigning for weeks, and lists must be submitted to prefectures by February 26, with voter registrations closing on February 6. A compilation of approximately 75 recent polls across major French cities is displayed in an interactive map, providing a snapshot of local political dynamics. The polls are not predictive but serve as a thermometer of current local political strength. In cities like Paris and Marseille, voter indecision remains high, with the left (e.g., Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, Beno\u00eet Payan) aiming to retain control against right-wing and far-right challengers. In contrast, clear favorites emerge in Lyon (Jean-Michel Aulas, DVD) and Perpignan (Louis Aliot, RN, incumbent). However, key cities with national political stakes\u2014such as Le Havre (\u00c9douard Philippe), Pau (Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou), and Nice (Christian Estrosi vs. \u00c9ric Ciotti)\u2014are not yet represented in the data, as no polls have been published for them as of February 15, 2026.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 06:42 AM\nSource:[Le Huffington Post](https://www.huffingtonpost.fr/politique/article/municipales-2026-la-carte-de-tous-les-sondages-a-un-mois-du-premier-tour_260405.html)\n\n**51 Key Cities to Watch in France's 2026 Municipal Elections**\nFranceinfo has identified 51 communes to monitor closely ahead of the 2026 French municipal elections, scheduled for March 15 and 22.

Carcassonne\u2019s Christophe Barth\u00e8s (d\u00e9put\u00e9) aims to succeed G\u00e9rard Larrat (Divers droite). Perpignan, the largest city held by RN, sees Louis Aliot (RN) seek re-election amid ongoing legal proceedings.

The results are expected to reveal national political shifts, particularly benefiting the Rassemblement National (RN), which aims to solidify its local presence. The RN plans to field at least 650 candidate lists, seeking to win 'several dozen' communes, especially in southern France, including Marseille, where incumbent Beno\u00eet Payan faces Franck Allisio. France Insoumise (LFI), presenting over 500 lists, aims to place hundreds of new council members to strengthen its grassroots movement, despite limited prospects for major victories. Key figures like Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon and Jordan Bardella are actively campaigning, with a symbolic showdown planned in Perpignan. The left, led by the PS, seeks to block the RN's advance, targeting cities like Saint-\u00c9tienne and Strasbourg. The right aims to reclaim lost ground in Lyon, Bordeaux, and Nice, where internal divisions exist between Christian Estrosi (Horizons) and Eric Ciotti (UDR, allied with RN). The PCF hopes to win N\u00eemes and retain strongholds like Montreuil and Vitry-sur-Seine. Ecologists fear losing major cities such as Lyon, Strasbourg, and Bordeaux, despite holding Grenoble and Tours. The centrist party Horizons, led by Edouard Philippe, has tied his 2027 presidential ambitions to a municipal victory. The elections will also test alliance strategies, with key issues including security, cost of living, health, and the environment. Although not a 'sanction vote' due to the low local presence of Macron\u2019s party, the results may signal voter priorities. However, past trends show municipal outcomes do not always predict presidential results, as seen in the 2020 green wave that failed to translate nationally.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 05:22 AM\nSource:[CNEWS](https://www.cnews.fr/france/2026-02-15/municipales-2026-un-mois-du-1er-tour-les-partis-en-ordre-de-marche-pour-le-grand)\n\n**Rassemblement National's 2026 Municipal Ambitions: A Strategic Path to the Elys\u00e9e**\nThe Rassemblement National (RN) is pursuing a strategic plan to win municipal elections in 2026 as a stepping stone toward national power in 2027. According to RN President Jordan Bardella, 'The alternance begins in French communes,' and the party aims to gain numerous municipalities, with a particular focus on major cities like Marseille, Toulon, and Nice, where candidates such as Franck Allisio, Laure Lavalette, and \u00c9ric Ciotti are running. The party also targets smaller towns in Hauts-de-France\u2014including H\u00e9nin-Beaumont, Lens, Douai, Cambrai, Denain, Douchy-les-Mines, and possibly Calais\u2014and key locations in the South such as Carcassonne, N\u00eemes, Tarascon, and Menton. In the Grand Est, limited ambitions remain. To broaden its base, the RN seeks to attract right-wing voters who feel politically orphaned, a move explained by political scientist Pascal Perrineau as a long-term strategy to influence future Senate elections, since municipal officials are key voters in senatorial elections. However, the party faces internal challenges: it recently withdrew candidates from Belfort and Carpentras after racist posts were discovered in their past. The RN is fielding 650 lists nationwide to demonstrate its local roots, though it currently controls only Perpignan, where Mayor Louis Aliot faces potential ineligibility due to a parliamentary assistants scandal.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 09:48 PM\nSource:[Franceinfo](https://www.franceinfo.fr/elections/municipales-2026-les-grandes-ambitions-du-rassemblement-national_7806077.html)\n\n**St\u00e9phane Ledru Re-enters Race for Soulitr\u00e9 Mayoralty with 2026 Municipal List**\nSt\u00e9phane Ledru, the outgoing mayor of Soulitr\u00e9 in the Sarthe department, has repositioned himself for a fourth term as mayor, following the absence of a successor after his three previous mandates.

The party Renaissance, under President Emmanuel Macron, is not pursuing ambitious goals for winning major cities, instead emphasizing 'humility' and 'pragmatism' as part of a narrative to frame a challenging electoral landscape positively. The party has only two prominent candidates in France\u2019s top ten cities: Violette Spillebout in Lille and Thomas Cazenave in Bordeaux, who formed an alliance after the death of the former LR mayor. Elsewhere, Renaissance supports candidates from Horizons or independent figures such as Martine Vassal in Marseille, Jean-Luc Moudenc in Toulouse, Christian Estrosi in Nice, and Pierre-Yves Bournazel in Paris\u2014individuals who left the right without formally joining Renaissance. The party\u2019s focus has shifted from winning mayoral races to increasing its presence in municipal councils, aiming to double its current 2,500 councilors. This strategy reflects a broader structural weakness: Renaissance lacks strong local roots, having been designed for national power rather than local governance. The party\u2019s lack of preparation, low prioritization of the elections, and absence of a clear local strategy suggest it may struggle to survive beyond Macron\u2019s presidency, with the 2027 presidential election looming as a potential turning point for its viability.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 07:38 AM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/fr/podcasts/politique-le-choix-de-la-semaine/20260214-%C3%A9lections-municipales-fran%C3%A7aises-le-parti-renaissance-menac%C3%A9-d-effacement)\n\n**Laurent Hureau Unveils His List of Candidates for the 2026 Municipal Elections in Saint-Mars-d'Outill\u00e9**\nLaurent Hureau, the head of the list 'Construire aujourd'hui pour mieux vivre demain' for the March 2026 municipal elections in Saint-Mars-d'Outill\u00e9, has unveiled his list of candidates.

Jean-Luc Moudenc\u2019s list faced criticism for alleged fiscal promises, including partial free public transport, prompting Sacha Briand to question the financial viability of such pledges, with a sharp exchange between candidates.

Fran\u00e7ois Piquemal (LFI) retaliated by labeling Jean-Jacques Bolzan, Moudenc\u2019s 'food affairs' deputy, as 'the FNSEA\u2019s elected official' and accused him of benefiting personally from his role.

He is running alongside Mohed Altrad, president of Montpellier H\u00e9rault Rugby and the Altrad group, who resigned from the municipal opposition in September 2024. Jean-Michel Aulas, former president of Olympique Lyonnais, is a leading candidate in Lyon at age 76, challenging incumbent David Doucet. Francis Lalanne, a singer previously declared ineligible until October 2026, is running in Lyon\u2019s 8th arrondissement and the Metropolis under the unaffiliated 'Spartacus' movement, which includes former far-right members. In Biarritz, 77-year-old rugby legend Serge Blanco is running as a political novice. In Vaires-sur-Marne, 52-year-old Olympic handball champion Olivier Girault is running, though he was suspended in February 2025 over mismanagement of the UNSS, the national school sports federation. In Avignon, former France 2 journalist Olivier Galzi is leading an independent list. In Nice, 79-year-old sports broadcaster G\u00e9rard Holtz, known for 'Stade 2' and 'Tout le sport', is running to support the city\u2019s bid for the 2030 Winter Olympics.

According to multiple surveys, 76% of French citizens closely follow municipal elections, with 80% basing their vote on local issues rather than national ones. A January 8, 2026, Ifop survey for Fr\u00e9quence Commune revealed that 74% of respondents believe municipal officials should come from civil society rather than political parties, though non-partisan former officials remain respected. In larger cities (over 100,000 inhabitants), 72% of voters say national conditions will influence their decision, compared to 51% in smaller towns. A November 2025 Odoxa-Mascaret survey found that 56% of French citizens want their current mayor re-elected, rising to 64% in municipalities under 3,500 residents. Mayors enjoy strong popularity\u201460% of citizens have a 'good' or 'very good' opinion of their mayor, far exceeding the approval of deputies (36%) and senators (26%). Key voter priorities include security (50%), healthcare (35%), local taxes (35%), economic development (27%), cleanliness (25%), and environmental protection (19%). On party alliances, only 39% support a left-wing coalition excluding LFI, while 62% of LR supporters favor an alliance with the RN. At the second round, 59% would vote against LFI, 46% against the presidential camp, and 44% against the RN. Polls in major cities like Paris and Lyon predict tightly contested races. The 2025 law has standardized the voting system nationwide: all municipalities now use a proportional-list system with a 50% majority bonus for the top list in the first round. If no list wins 50%, a second round is held with candidates receiving over 10% advancing. In smaller communes (under 1,000 inhabitants), list parity is eased, and minimum council sizes are set at 5, 9, or 13 members. Paris, Lyon, and Marseille maintain unique dual systems: one for municipal councilors and another for district/sector councilors, with a reduced 25% majority bonus. Paris and Marseille also elect metropolitan councilors on the same list as municipal candidates, while Lyon holds a separate metropolitan election.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 01:37 PM\nSource:[L'internaute](https://www.linternaute.com/actualite/politique/7982831-elections-municipales-2026-resultats-des-sondages-dates-nouveautes-ce-qu-il-faut-deja-avoir-en-tete/)\n\n**Municipales 2026: Polls Reveal Frontrunners in Paris, Marseille, Lyon, Bordeaux, Lille, and Toulouse**\nTwo months before the 2026 French municipal elections (15 and 22 March 2026), polling data reveal emerging frontrunners in major cities. In Paris, Culture Minister Rachida Dati leads with 27% in a first-round scenario, benefiting from a divided left, while incumbent Anne Hidalgo\u2019s satisfaction rating stands at just 29%, despite 58% support for her 30 km/h traffic policy. In Marseille, a tight race is forming between Beno\u00eet Payan (DVG) and Franck Allisio (RN), both at 30%, with Martine Vassal (center-right) at 23% and S\u00e9bastien Delogu (LFI) at 14%, indicating a left-wing vs. Rassemblement National dynamic. In Lyon, outgoing green mayor Gr\u00e9gory Doucet leads with 38% under a left-wing alliance, but faces a threat from Jean-Michel Aulas, who reaches 34% if center-right and right-wing parties unite. In Bordeaux, incumbent Pierre Hurmic leads with 32%, ahead of Thomas Cazenave (Renaissance) at 26%, with outcomes depending on coalition scenarios: Cazenave wins in a three-way race (44%), but Hurmic prevails in a four-way contest (35%). In Lille, Martine Aubry\u2019s 25-year tenure ends, and her successor Arnaud Deslandes (PS) trails closely behind Ecologists (19%) and Renaissance\u2019s Violette Spillebout (17%), with the PS at 21%, raising concerns about the city\u2019s political stability. In Toulouse, incumbent Jean-Luc Moudenc (DVD/LR) leads with 36%, while the left splits between Fran\u00e7ois Brian\u00e7on (PS, 22%) and Fran\u00e7ois Piquemal (LFI, 14%), setting up a decisive second-round contest.

Eight of these are led by Socialist or Green mayors (Paris, Marseille, Nantes, Montpellier, Lyon, Strasbourg, Bordeaux, Lille), while two are led by traditional right-wing leaders (Toulouse, Nice). Despite their strong presence in local government, the Socialist Party, the Greens, and the National Rally (RN) have not reached the presidential runoff since 2012, with RN and La France Insoumise (LFI) absent from the top 30 cities. The centrist Macronist camp has minimal representation, with only Edouard Philippe (Le Havre) and Christian Estrosi (Nice, from the Republicans) holding key positions, indicating weak local anchoring. The election is not expected to predict presidential outcomes, but political battles are expected to escalate nationally. In Paris, where Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo has served since 2014, the right-wing candidate Rachida Dati aims to reclaim the city, leveraging public divisions over urban mobility policies. Hidalgo, who received only 1.7% of the vote in the 2022 presidential election, will not run. Her first deputy, Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire, has been endorsed by the Socialist Party and will receive support from ecologists and communists in the first round to ensure a leftist candidate reaches the runoff. Sophia Chikirou will run for LFI, and Aymeric Caron, a writer and former TV commentator, is expected to run on an independent left-wing list.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 05, 2026 05:30 AM\nSource:[RTBF](https://www.rtbf.be/article/etats-unis-israel-hongrie-france-bresil-les-elections-cles-qui-pourraient-rebattre-les-cartes-en-2026-11655226)\n\n**Municipal 2026: All Polls Map Ahead of First Round in 100 Days**\nWith 100 days remaining until the first round of the 2026 French municipal elections on Sunday, March 15, 2025, approximately 36,000 communes will hold voting.

In Paris, the race to succeed Socialist mayor Anne Hidalgo is marked by weakened candidacy from Rachida Dati and divided hopes within the left. In Marseille, outgoing Socialist mayor Beno\u00eet Payan faces strong challenges from Martine Vassal and a rising National Rally (RN) campaign led by Franck Allisio. In Lyon, former Olympique Lyonnais president Jean-Michel Aulas is significantly disrupting the campaign and threatening incumbent ecologist mayor Gr\u00e9gory Doucet, elected in 2020. Recent polls show Aulas close to winning outright in the first round, similar to Doriane B\u00e9cue, the outgoing mayor of Tourcoing aligned with G\u00e9rald Darmanin. Overall, the political momentum for the 'green wave' that brought new leaders to cities like Annecy, Bordeaux, and Strasbourg nearly six years ago appears to be waning, according to the latest opinion surveys. These polls also indicate that the left\u2014whether socialist or ecologist\u2014will likely need support from Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon\u2019s France Insoumise to form viable coalitions.

The party, led by Jean-Luc M\u00e9lenchon, currently governs only a small number of towns\u2014most notably Faches-Thumesnil (18,000 inhabitants)\u2014and has no representation in the Senate. This time, LFI aims to be present in approximately 500 cities, including 75% of communes with over 30,000 residents, either as head of list or in support of other lists. The campaign will rely heavily on prominent national deputies such as Sophia Chikirou (Paris), S\u00e9bastien Delogu (Marseille), Ana\u00efs Belouassa-Cherifi (Lyon), Fran\u00e7ois Piquemal (Toulouse), Nathalie Oziol (Montpellier), and Marie Mesmeur (Rennes), with around 15 deputies already or soon to be officially nominated. According to Paul Vannier, LFI\u2019s election coordinator, all polls show the party above 10% in major cities. LFI is targeting key urban centers like Roubaix, La Courneuve, and Evry\u2014where deputy Farida Amrani is running\u2014as credible opportunities for success. Manuel Bompard, national coordinator, emphasized that entering municipal councils is the primary goal: 'Gaining two or three mayors would already be a very strong result.' The strategy aims to build momentum for future Senate elections in 2026 and 2029, where local elected officials vote. LFI remains cautious, acknowledging the difficulty of winning in second-round contests. The party has chosen to run independently in most cities, avoiding alliances with Ecologists, the Socialist Party, or the Communist Party\u2014raising concerns among left-wing allies about splitting the left and enabling right-wing gains, especially in Paris. Sophia Chikirou declared, 'I don\u2019t want a socialist to be mayor of Paris,' criticizing the Socialist candidate Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire. Manuel Bompard stressed the need for balanced cooperation: 'The conditions of unity can\u2019t always mean LFI being behind.' In many municipalities, internal left-wing tensions are expected to lead to tough second-round negotiations, where a 10% threshold is needed to survive and 5% to merge with another list. Paul Vannier warned: 'Nothing will be possible without us.' This caution reflects the setback in Villeneuve-Saint-Georges, where deputy Louis Boyard lost the second round with 39% despite a strong base, partly due to failure to unify the left.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 23, 2025 05:48 AM\nSource:[Sud Radio](https://www.sudradio.fr/societe/la-france-insoumise-se-met-en-ordre-de-bataille-pour-les-municipales)\n\n**As Municipal Elections Approach, Political Parties Refine Strategies and Alliances**\nWith the first round of the French municipal elections approaching on March 15, political parties are finalizing their local strategies and alliances, reflecting national dynamics. On the left, La France Insoumise (LFI) is running independently in most cities, even those traditionally left-leaning, risking shifting them to the right; LFI aims to establish a presence in municipal councils to strengthen its position for future Senate elections, though it does not expect to win many mayoral races. The Socialist Party (PS), Greens, and Communists are expected to form alliances in cities they previously governed, though unity in Paris remains uncertain, with David Belliard (Greens) challenging PS candidate Emmanuel Gr\u00e9goire. The Greens face challenges in key cities like Lyon, Strasbourg, and Poitiers, as ecological issues have faded from public debate. The PS seeks to retain its strong local presence but faces difficulties in Marseille and opposition from Greens in Lille and Montpellier. The left also aims to capture right-leaning cities such as Toulouse, Saint-\u00c9tienne, Limoges, Amiens, and Caen. On the right, The Republicans (LR) have failed to revive their 'blue wave' under Bruno Retailleau, with candidates like Rachida Dati (suspended from LR), Jean-Luc Moudenc (former LR), and Jean-Michel Aulas receiving support despite political fractures. LR\u2019s weakened position is evident in cities like N\u00eemes, Toulon, and Saint-\u00c9tienne, where the National Rally (RN) is aggressively targeting gains, especially in the southeastern region. Horizons remains open to defectors. The RN is fielding a record number of candidates, aiming to break into traditionally hostile areas like Brest and Bordeaux, with two key targets: Toulon (Laure Lavalette) and Nice (Eric Ciotti vs. Christian Estrosi). The RN is also expanding in rural areas and leveraging independent outgoing mayors to build a base for Senate gains and to secure 500 signatures for the 2027 presidential election. In the government camp, Renaissance (formerly La R\u00e9publique En Marche) has limited ambitions, supporting candidates like Martine Vassal (Marseille), Jean-Michel Aulas (Lyon), and Pierre-Yves Bournazel (Paris), while avoiding overt presidential ambitions. Edouard Philippe seeks a third term in Le Havre, and Fran\u00e7ois Bayrou may run for a third term in Pau. In Bordeaux, Thomas Cazenave and Nathalie Delattre are competing for leadership of the centrist bloc to challenge Green mayor Pierre Hurmic.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: November 17, 2025 06:17 AM\nSource:[www.Bluewin.ch](https://www.bluewin.ch/fr/infos/international/a-lapproche-des-municipales-les-partis-affutent-leurs-strategies-2965315.html)\n\n**Results of the 2026 Municipal Elections in Toulouse (31500)**\nThe 2020 municipal elections in Toulouse saw the list AIMER TOULOUSE AVEC JEAN\u2011LUC MOUDENC win 51.98% of the expressed votes, while the list ARCHIPEL CITOYEN received 48.01%.
