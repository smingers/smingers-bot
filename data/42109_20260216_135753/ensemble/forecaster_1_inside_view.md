## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- January 2026 = 19 deliveries (multiple independent sources: AeroTime, Simple Flying, Bernstein)
- 2025 total = 793 deliveries (official Airbus)
- Supply chain constraints continuing into 2026 (CEO Faury statement, Bernstein analysis)
- Historical pattern: March 2023 = 61 deliveries

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Bernstein's 2026 forecast reduction from 900 to 865 (expert opinion, but single source)
- Q1 historically weaker than Q4 (pattern established in 2025 data)
- Engine supply remains "trickiest" constraint (CEO statement)
- January 2026 represents slowest decade start (AeroTime analysis)

**Weak Evidence:**
- Christian Scherer's optimism that A320 issues "won't carry into 2026" (contradicted by January data)
- Market consensus of 910 deliveries for 2026 (may be stale)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 43 days from today (February 16) to end of March 2026

**If halved (21 days to mid-March):** Would predict lower as only ~15 days of production data available; likely 25-35 deliveries

**If doubled (86 days, through April):** Would predict cumulative Feb+March at 90-130 deliveries, suggesting March alone at 55-75 range

**Key temporal factors:**
- January's 19 deliveries sets concerning baseline
- Typical Q1 pattern: January weak, February moderate, March stronger
- Historical March 2023 (61) occurred in similar Q1 context
- Only 6 weeks remain for production/delivery execution

## (d) Justification

**Shifting from Outside View:**

The outside view suggested 60-65 as central tendency based on:
- 2025 monthly average: 66.1
- March 2023: 61
- Assumption of Q1 recovery from January

**However, strong current evidence demands downward adjustment:**

1. **January 2026 catastrophically low (19 vs. 26 in Jan 2025, 30 in Jan 2024):** This is not normal post-holiday weakness—it represents a 27% decline YoY and 37% below January 2024. This suggests structural production problems, not timing.

2. **Expert forecast reduction:** Bernstein cutting 2026 forecast from 900 to 865 (monthly average from 75 to 72) reflects professional assessment that constraints are worsening, not improving.

3. **CEO acknowledgment of ongoing constraints:** Faury's statement about engines being "trickiest parts" in 2024-2025 with no indication of resolution contradicts earlier optimism.

4. **Q1 pattern implications:** If January = 19 and we assume linear ramp within Q1 toward ~72/month average (865/12), then:
   - February might be ~45-50
   - March might be ~55-65
   But this assumes improvement that January data doesn't support.

**Most compelling shift factor:** January's 19 deliveries is 71% below the 2025 monthly average. Even accounting for Q1 weakness, this is extreme. If February shows similar weakness (say, 35-45), March would need to be 70-80 to maintain quarterly trajectory—unlikely given production constraints.

**Revised central estimate:** 52-58 deliveries (down from 60-65)
- This represents ~3x January's rate (reasonable Q1 ramp)
- Slightly below March 2023's 61 (reflecting worse starting position)
- Aligns with Bernstein's reduced expectations

## Distribution Calibration

**Current trend continuation:** If January's weakness (19) persists proportionally, March could be 40-50. If recovery occurs as hoped, 60-70.

**Distribution shape considerations:**
- Not hedged: Genuine uncertainty exists between "continued weakness" (45-55) and "recovery" (60-70) scenarios
- Tail risks: Lower tail (35-40) if February also disappoints; upper tail (70-75) if aggressive catch-up occurs
- The 19-delivery January creates wide confidence intervals

**Percentile logic:**
- 10th percentile (42): Continued production struggles, February also weak (~30-35), March barely improves
- Median (54): Modest recovery, ~3x January rate, slightly below March 2023
- 90th percentile (68): Strong recovery, approaching 2025 average, optimistic scenario

**Sensitivity check (±10% adjustment):**
- 10th at 38 vs. 46: 38 seems too pessimistic (would imply worsening); 46 reasonable
- 90th at 61 vs. 75: 75 seems too optimistic given January data; 68 balanced
- Adjusting median from 54 to 49 or 59: 49 too pessimistic (ignores typical March strength); 59 slightly optimistic but defensible

**Final calibration:** Centering at 54 with 10th=42, 90th=68 reflects:
- Downward shift from outside view (60-65) due to January shock
- Maintained uncertainty about recovery pace
- Respect for March 2023 baseline (61) while acknowledging worse starting position

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** Total Airbus commercial aircraft deliveries reported for March 2026 only (single month), measured in aircraft count.

2. **Outside view base rate:** 60-65 central tendency based on 2025 average (66.1) and March 2023 (61). Current forecast shifts down to 52-58 due to January 2026's extreme weakness (19 deliveries).

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 54; mean ≈ 55. This makes sense: ~3x January's rate, slightly below March 2023 (61), reflecting cautious recovery from weak Q1 start. Aligns with Bernstein's reduced 2026 expectations.

4. **Three most significant evidence pieces:**
   - January 2026 = 19 deliveries (71% below 2025 average, multiple reliable sources)
   - Bernstein reduced 2026 forecast from 900 to 865 aircraft (expert analysis, February 16, 2026)
   - CEO Faury confirmed ongoing engine supply constraints (named source, February 2026)
   - March 2023 = 61 deliveries (historical baseline for March performance)

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Airbus executed aggressive catch-up production in February (60-70 deliveries) that signals resolved constraints, making March deliver 75-85 aircraft. This would push outcome UP and make my forecast look conservative.

6. **Status quo outcome:** January's 19 represents new, concerning status quo. Without evidence of February improvement, assuming return to 60+ in March may be optimistic. Slight nudge toward 50-52 median might be prudent, but March typically shows strength vs. January, justifying 54 median.

7. **Technicalities:** Values in aircraft count (integers), strictly increasing percentiles, within 0-150 bounds (well within upper bound).
