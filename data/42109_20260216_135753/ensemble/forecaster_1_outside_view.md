## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **March deliveries specifically (2018-2025):** Most relevant but limited data extracted
   - March 2023: 61 deliveries (only specific March datapoint available)
   
2. **Monthly deliveries in 2025:** Highly relevant for recent performance
   - January 2026: 19 deliveries
   - November 2025: 72 deliveries
   - December 2025: ~121 deliveries
   - Average monthly 2025: 793/12 = 66.1 deliveries

3. **Q1 monthly patterns:** Relevant for seasonal effects
   - January typically lower (19 in 2026)
   - March historically stronger than January
   - Q1 2025 implied: (793 - 507 for 9M = 286 for Q4; working backwards, Q1 likely ~150-180 total)

4. **Year-over-year March comparisons:** Would be ideal but only March 2023 (61) available

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** Monthly deliveries in 2025, with emphasis on Q1 patterns and the March 2023 datapoint.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 
- Today: February 16, 2026
- Target: March 2026 deliveries
- Time horizon: ~6 weeks until end of March

**Historical Patterns:**

*2025 Monthly Pattern:*
- January 2026: 19 (likely January 2025 was similar - low)
- Average monthly: 66.1
- November 2025: 72
- December 2025: 121 (heavily backloaded, year-end push)

*Quarterly Pattern:*
- 2025 was described as "backloaded" with deliveries ramping through the year
- Q1 typically weaker than Q4
- March typically stronger than January within Q1

*Known March Data:*
- March 2023: 61 deliveries

**Key Factors for March 2026:**

*Positive factors:*
- Supply chain improving (Scherer: A320 issues "won't carry into 2026")
- Production ramp-up continuing toward rate 75 target
- Two new FALs operational (Mobile, Tianjin)
- January 2026 (19) likely artificially low due to post-holiday effects

*Negative factors:*
- Still facing engine supply constraints (Pratt & Whitney)
- January 2026 very low (19) suggests slow Q1 start
- Historical Q1 weakness
- Supply chain described as "complex and dynamic"

## (d) Justification

March 2026 deliveries should be analyzed against:

1. **Baseline from 2025 average:** 66.1 deliveries/month
2. **Q1 seasonal adjustment:** March typically 20-40% above January in Q1
3. **Recent trend:** January 2026 at 19 suggests cautious start to year
4. **March 2023 comparison:** 61 deliveries

Given January 2026's very low 19 deliveries, there are two scenarios:
- **Scenario A:** January was anomalously low (holiday effects, timing), March returns to ~60-75 range
- **Scenario B:** Q1 2026 genuinely weak, March stays in 40-60 range

The 2025 average of 66.1 and March 2023's 61 deliveries provide anchors. However, January 2026's 19 is concerning - if we assume roughly linear ramp within Q1, and target ~900 deliveries for 2026 (75/month average), March should be in the 55-75 range.

Christian Scherer's statement that late-2025 issues "won't carry into 2026" suggests improvement, but the January data contradicts this optimism. The most likely scenario is March delivers 50-70 aircraft, with 60-65 as the central estimate.

Outside view calibration:

## Calibration Considerations

**(a) Distribution Shape:**
- Not hedged/smooth: Should reflect genuine uncertainty about Q1 ramp-up
- Not overconfident: January's 19 creates significant uncertainty about March
- Range focus: March could plausibly be 40-85 depending on production recovery

**(b) Established Distributions:**
- 2025 monthly distribution: Mean 66.1, with high variance (19 to 121)
- March 2023: 61 provides a tether point
- Normal production months in 2025: 60-75 range

**(c) Tail Considerations:**
- Lower tail (10th percentile): Could be as low as 45 if Q1 weakness persists
- Upper tail (90th percentile): Could reach 80-85 if strong recovery
- The January 19 figure suggests downside risk is real

**(d) Domain Upset Rate:**
- Airbus missed targets 3 of last 4 years
- Supply chain disruptions common
- December 2025 fuselage issue was unexpected
- Rate of upsets: ~25-30% suggests wider intervals needed

**Distribution Logic:**
- Central tendency: 60-65 (matching March 2023 and 2025 average)
- 10th percentile: 48 (accounting for continued Q1 weakness)
- 90th percentile: 78 (accounting for strong recovery scenario)
- Spread reflects genuine uncertainty from January's poor performance
