Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (High Quality):**
1. **Airbus official press release (Jan 2026)** - 793 deliveries in 2025, 4% YoY growth. Factual, audited data. High reliability.
2. **AeroTime (Feb 6, 2026)** - 19 deliveries in January 2026, slowest decade start. Cites Airbus official data. High reliability for factual content. CEO Faury's comments on engine supply chains are expert opinion from decision-maker.
3. **Simple Flying (Feb 10, 2026)** - Confirms 19 January deliveries with breakdown (15 A320neo, 3 A220, 1 A350). Cross-validates AeroTime data.

**Analyst Sources (Moderate Quality):**
4. **Bernstein Research (Feb 16, 2026)** - Analyst Douglas Harned forecasts 865 deliveries for 2026 (down from 900), vs consensus 910. This is expert opinion with clear methodology, though speculative.

**News Aggregation (Moderate Quality):**
5. **AskNews articles** - Multiple sources confirm January weakness, supply chain issues, and 2025 performance. Emirates A350 delivery news and Frontier deferral signal ongoing capacity constraints.

**Key Factual Points:**
- January 2026: 19 deliveries (confirmed by multiple sources)
- 2025 total: 793 deliveries
- Historical March average (2018-2025): 62 deliveries
- Supply chain issues: Engine bottlenecks acknowledged by CEO Faury
- Analyst consensus for 2026: 910 aircraft (Bernstein more conservative at 865)

**Key Expert Opinions:**
- Faury (Airbus CEO): Engines remain "trickiest parts" but improving
- Harned (Bernstein): 2026 deliveries will be challenging, expects 865 vs 910 consensus

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **January 2026 = 19 deliveries** (multiple independent sources confirm): This is 27% below January 2025 (26) and 37% below January 2024 (30). If Q1 follows historical 1:2:3 ratio and totals ~150 (17% of ~880 annual), then Feb+Mar must deliver ~131. At 1:2:3, that's ~44 Feb, ~66 Mar.
- **Historical March seasonality**: Eight-year mean = 62, std = 11. March consistently delivers 50-75 aircraft except pandemic (36 in 2020).

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Supply chain improvements**: Faury states engines improving from 2024-25 bottlenecks. Two new A320 FALs operational. This supports upper-mid range outcomes (60-70).
- **Analyst forecast divergence**: Bernstein's 865 vs consensus 910 suggests uncertainty. If 865 is correct and Q1 is 17%, that's ~147 total, implying ~62 for March (aligns with historical mean).
- **2025 back-loading pattern**: Airbus delivered heavily in Q4 2025 to hit 793 target. This suggests capacity exists but may be exhausted, limiting Q1 2026 surge potential.

**Weak Evidence:**
- Frontier deferral news suggests industry-wide capacity constraints but doesn't directly impact Airbus March production.
- Emirates hiring and A350 deliveries are positive signals but too indirect.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeframe**: 43 days until end of March 2026; outcome known early April 2026.

**If halved (21 days to mid-March)**: Would shift prediction lower as early-month deliveries are typically slower. Would expect ~30-35 by mid-March.

**If doubled (86 days to end of April)**: Would add April's typical ~55-65 deliveries, yielding ~115-130 cumulative. Distribution would widen significantly.

**Current dynamics**: January's extreme weakness (19 vs historical ~25-30) creates pressure for February-March catch-up. However, Airbus rarely surges dramatically in Q1. The 1:2:3 historical ratio suggests March should be ~3x January, implying ~57 deliveries if pattern holds with weak start.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view baseline**: Normal(62, 11) with 10th/90th at 35/85.

**Factors supporting downward shift:**
1. January 2026 weakness (19 vs 26-30 historical) suggests systemic Q1 2026 underperformance
2. Bernstein's conservative 865 annual forecast implies ~62 March if historical Q1 percentage holds
3. CEO acknowledgment of ongoing supply chain challenges

**Factors supporting upward shift:**
1. Two new FALs operational (increased capacity)
2. Engine situation "improving" per CEO
3. Strong 2025 finish (793) shows capability when constraints ease

**Net assessment**: The January weakness is a strong negative signal that outweighs capacity improvements. However, March historically runs ~3x January, and complete collapse seems unlikely. I'll shift the distribution down ~8-10 aircraft from the outside view baseline while maintaining similar spread.

## Distribution Calibration

**Central tendency**: January's 19 deliveries × 3 (historical March/January ratio) = 57. This aligns with Bernstein's implied ~62 if his 865 annual forecast is correct. I'll center around 58-60.

**Downside tail (10th percentile)**: Extreme scenario would be another quality issue or labor disruption → ~32 (similar to pandemic-adjacent weakness but not full 2020 collapse).

**Upside tail (90th percentile)**: Aggressive catch-up with all capacity firing → ~78 (above historical mean but below 2019 peak of 74, accounting for new capacity).

**Distribution shape**: Slightly left-skewed given January weakness creates asymmetric risk. The 40th-60th range should be tight around 57-62, with wider tails for uncertainty.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Total Airbus commercial aircraft deliveries reported for March 2026 (single month, units = count).

2. **Outside view**: Normal(62, 11), 10th/90th = 35/85. My forecast shifts down ~5 aircraft at median due to January weakness signal.

3. **Consistency**: Implied median = 59; mean ≈ 60. This makes sense given January's 19 × 3 = 57, plus modest catch-up potential. Aligns with weak Q1 start but historical March recovery pattern.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - January 2026 delivered only 19 aircraft (27% below prior year)
   - Historical March/January ratio averages ~2.5-3.0×
   - CEO confirms ongoing engine supply constraints but improving
   - Bernstein analyst forecasts 865 annual (implies ~62 March)
   - Two new A320 FALs now operational (capacity upside)

5. **Blind-spot**: Major quality issue discovered mid-March (like December 2025 fuselage panel defect) forcing delivery freeze → outcome drops to 35-40 range.

6. **Status quo**: If nothing changes from January's weak pace, March would deliver ~57 (3× January). Given 43 days remaining and typical monthly acceleration, slight upward bias from pure extrapolation is warranted, but not dramatic.

7. **Technicalities**: Values strictly increasing, units = count, all within 0-150 bounds.
