Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Airbus Official Sources (Orders & Deliveries page, Press Releases):**
- January 2026: 19 deliveries reported
- 2025 full year: 793 deliveries (announced Jan 12, 2026)
- Quality: Highest - primary source, official company data
- These are factual reports, not opinions

**Third-party News Articles:**
- Seattle Times (Jan 13, 2026): Reports Airbus delivered 793 in 2025, missed original 820 target due to A320 fuselage panel quality issues in December 2025. Quotes Christian Scherer (outgoing Airbus Commercial Aircraft CEO) stating A320 issues "won't carry into 2026" and supply chain situation "is much brighter now." Quality: High - includes direct quotes from named executives.

- AFM.aero (9M 2025 data): 507 deliveries through September 2025, reaffirmed ~820 target (later reduced to ~790). Quality: Medium-high - industry publication with specific numbers.

- CNBC (Jan 11, 2026): Focuses on Boeing but mentions Airbus scheduled to report 2025 data on Jan 13, 2026. Quality: High for general context.

**Agent Report:**
- Comprehensive analysis of monthly delivery patterns
- Key facts: November 2025 had 72 deliveries, December 2025 approximately 121 deliveries (derived from 793 annual - 672 Jan-Nov)
- Notes supply chain constraints (fuselage panels, engine shortages) affected late 2025
- Mentions "internal assumption" of ~900 deliveries for 2026 (unverified)
- Quality: Good synthesis but mixing verified data with industry speculation

**Key Expert Opinions (factual basis):**
- Christian Scherer: A320 issues resolved, supply chain "much brighter"
- Guillaume Faury: Deliveries "backloaded" in 2025 due to complex environment

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **March deliveries specifically (2018-2025):** Most direct but data incomplete in sources
2. **Q1 monthly average (2018-2025):** Accounts for seasonal patterns
3. **Monthly deliveries in 2025:** Most recent comparable period
4. **Post-ramp-up monthly deliveries (2023-2025):** Reflects current production environment

**Selected Reference Class: Monthly deliveries in 2025**

Rationale: 2025 represents the most relevant production environment (post-COVID recovery, current supply chain state, similar rate targets). We have specific data points:
- January 2025: Unknown individually
- November 2025: 72 deliveries
- December 2025: ~121 deliveries (year-end push)
- January 2026: 19 deliveries
- 2025 average: 793/12 = 66.1 per month

The 2025 pattern shows significant monthly variation with December being exceptional (year-end delivery push) and January being unusually low (post-holiday restart).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** March 2026 is 43 days away (from Feb 16, 2026)

**Historical Patterns:**

From available data:
- 2025 total: 793 deliveries (66.1/month average)
- Q4 2025 showed acceleration: Nov (72) + Dec (~121) = 193 in two months
- January 2026: 19 deliveries (significantly below average - typical post-holiday slowdown)

**Seasonal Considerations:**
- January typically shows restart/ramp-up effects (19 deliveries confirms this)
- February-March should show normalization toward sustainable rates
- March historically not a year-end push month, so shouldn't see December-like spikes
- Q1 typically lower than Q4 due to year-end delivery concentration

**Supply Chain Context:**
- December 2025 fuselage panel issues reportedly resolved
- Scherer stated issues "won't carry into 2026"
- Engine constraints remain but described as "much brighter"
- Rate 75 target for 2027 implies gradual monthly increases through 2026

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Calculation:**
- 2025 monthly average: 66.1 deliveries
- Excluding December outlier (121), 2025 average: 672/11 = 61.1 deliveries
- November 2025 (normal production month): 72 deliveries

**Adjustments for March 2026:**

*Positive factors:*
1. Supply chain improvements noted by management
2. Resolution of December 2025 fuselage panel issues
3. Two months (Feb-Mar) for production normalization after January restart
4. New FALs operational (Mobile, Tianjin)
5. Gradual ramp toward rate 75 target

*Negative factors:*
1. January 2026 only delivered 19 (suggests Q1 2026 starting slow)
2. Persistent engine supply constraints
3. March is middle of Q1, not a delivery-push month
4. Conservative post-issue ramp-up likely

**Expected Range:**
- Lower bound: If January's weakness persists, 40-50 deliveries
- Central estimate: Return to 2025 normal levels, 60-70 deliveries  
- Upper bound: Accelerated recovery, 75-85 deliveries
- Tail risk high: Year-end style push unlikely but possible, 90-100 deliveries

The most likely scenario is March 2026 delivering in the 55-75 range, representing normalization from January's 19 but not yet reaching peak 2025 rates.

## Outside View Calibration

**Distribution Considerations:**

1. **Tethering to established patterns:**
   - 2025 monthly median (excluding Dec): ~61 deliveries
   - 2025 November: 72 deliveries (good normal month)
   - January 2026: 19 (restart effects)

2. **Uncertainty factors:**
   - Only one 2026 datapoint available (January)
   - Supply chain volatility demonstrated in late 2025
   - Production ramp trajectory uncertain
   - Two-month gap between now and outcome

3. **Tail considerations:**
   - 10th percentile: Must account for continued weakness (January-like)
   - 90th percentile: Must account for strong recovery or unexpected push
   - Historical monthly range in 2025: ~19 to 121 (extreme spread)

4. **Rate of upsets:**
   - Airbus missed 2025 target (820→793) due to unexpected December issue
   - Supply chain disruptions have been recurring theme
   - However, month-to-month volatility is normal in aerospace

**Calibration Strategy:**
- Center distribution around 60-65 (normalized 2025 rate)
- 10th percentile: 45 (accounts for extended weakness)
- 90th percentile: 85 (accounts for strong recovery, not year-end push)
- Avoid overconfidence given limited 2026 data
