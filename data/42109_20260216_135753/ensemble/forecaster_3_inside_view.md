Analysis:
### 1) Target / resolution criterion (paraphrase)
This resolves to the **count of Airbus commercial aircraft “deliveries” reported for March 2026** in Airbus’ official monthly Orders & Deliveries data (units: aircraft).

## (a) Source analysis (quality, what’s factual vs opinion)
1) **Airbus press release on 2025 results (Jan 2026)**  
- **Factual:** 2025 total deliveries = **793**. Backlog figures (incl. widebody backlog 1,124).  
- **Quality:** Very high (primary company disclosure).  
- **Use:** Sets an annual baseline and indicates ongoing demand (backlog), but not month-specific for 2026.

2) **Airbus monthly deliveries for January 2026 (reported via AeroTime / Simple Flying; also consistent with Airbus monthly reporting)**  
- **Factual:** **January 2026 deliveries = 19**. Also breakdown mentions 15 A320neo-family, 3 A220, 1 A350 (from Simple Flying summary).  
- **Quality:** Medium-high as secondary reporting, but the key number (19) is widely reported and should match Airbus’ own monthly release.  
- **Use:** Directly relevant—latest realized run-rate signal for 2026, and it is unusually low.

3) **Bernstein analyst note (Feb 16, 2026; Aktiencheck/finanzen.net/wallstreet:online)**  
- **Factual:** Bernstein **revised 2026 delivery forecast to 865** (from 900) and cites **consensus ~910**.  
- **Opinion:** Analyst judgment about “challenge”/risk profile and delivery outlook.  
- **Quality:** Moderate. Identifiable expert, but still an analyst model; not Airbus guidance.

4) **FAA proposed AD on A350 (Feb 13, 2026)**  
- **Factual:** Maintenance/inspection requirements for in-service aircraft.  
- **Quality:** High for what it covers, but **not directly predictive** of monthly deliveries (production/delivery flow usually not materially altered by this type of AD).

5) **Airline/route and hiring stories (Emirates hiring, Centrum Air route, etc.)**  
- **Factual:** General demand/operations context.  
- **Quality:** Low relevance to Airbus March-2026 deliveries (doesn’t constrain Airbus output in the next ~6 weeks).

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
### Strong evidence
- **January 2026 deliveries = 19 (very low)**: This is the most direct, recent datapoint on delivery throughput entering 2026. It strongly supports a **below-normal Q1** and raises the probability of a weaker March than the 2025 “typical month.”

### Moderate evidence
- **2025 total deliveries = 793**: Solid baseline for “normal” monthly levels (~66/month average, with strong year-end backloading). Supports anchoring March to a mid-year-style month rather than a year-end surge.  
- **Bernstein 2026 forecast 865 vs consensus 910**: Points to meaningful uncertainty and some downside risk around 2026 delivery execution; modest downward pull on near-term expectations (including March), but not determinative for a single month.

### Weak evidence
- **Supply-chain narrative (engines, fuselage panels) in secondary summaries**: Plausible mechanism, but without fresh, quantified February/March production signals it’s mainly used to justify **wider uncertainty** rather than a large mean shift.  
- **Demand/backlog anecdotes**: Demand is not the binding constraint; supply-chain and delivery logistics are.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- From **today (Feb 16, 2026)** to the end of **March 2026** is ~**6 weeks**; resolution is by **Apr 1, 2026**.  
- If the timeframe were **halved** (e.g., forecasting February instead of March), I’d lean even lower because early-year seasonality and restart effects dominate.  
- If **doubled** (e.g., forecasting through June), I’d shift the median upward toward the annual run-rate needed for 865–910 deliveries, since catch-up/backloading becomes more feasible.

## (d) Justification: shifting the outside view to an inside view
### Outside view base rate (given)
Percentile 10/20/40/60/80/90 = **45 / 52 / 60 / 67 / 76 / 85**.

### Key inside-view updates
1) **January 2026 = 19 deliveries** is a clear “slow start” signal. Even allowing for seasonality, it increases the odds that **March is also sub-par** (or at least not strong).  
2) **Annual 2026 forecasts (865–910)** imply Airbus *eventually* needs higher monthly output than 2025’s average, but that can be achieved via **mid/late-year acceleration** (and Q4 backloading), not necessarily by March.  
3) Net effect: **slightly lower central tendency for March vs the outside-view center**, and **wider tails** (because we have one extreme low datapoint and uncertain pace of normalization).

Status quo outcome if nothing changed: Airbus “typical non-December” month near **~60** deliveries. January’s 19 suggests “nothing changed” might actually mean continued weakness into early Q1, so I nudge below 60 while keeping a path to recovery by March.

Distribution calibration
- I’m shifting the distribution **down modestly** versus the outside view (especially at P40–P60), but **not collapsing** it—March could rebound sharply if deliveries were simply delayed/logistically bunched.  
- I’m also widening the upper tail a bit because if Airbus is smoothing a January shortfall, some rebound could appear by March (though a December-like spike is still unlikely).

Checklist:
1) Target variable: **Airbus commercial aircraft deliveries in March 2026 (count)** from Airbus official monthly data.  
2) Outside view base rate distribution: **45 / 52 / 60 / 67 / 76 / 85** (P10–P90).  
3) Consistency check: **Implied median ≈ 59–61; mean ≈ low 60s**; consistent with “normal ~60” but pulled down by weak January.  
4) Most significant evidence (<=20 words each):
   - January 2026 deliveries were **19**, unusually low for Airbus.
   - Airbus delivered **793 in 2025** (~66/month average; heavy year-end backloading).
   - Bernstein forecasts **865** deliveries in 2026 vs **~910** consensus (execution uncertainty).
5) Blind spot: A **rapid engine/final-assembly clearing** could bunch deliveries into March, pushing outcome **up**.  
6) Status quo: A “normal” month around **~60**, but Q1 weakness nudges slightly below.  
7) Technicalities: Percentiles strictly increasing; units are aircraft count; within 0–150.
