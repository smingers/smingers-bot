Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Airbus Orders & Deliveries web page (official, Jan-2026 data) – fact: 19 aircraft delivered in January 2026. Highest-quality, resolves the question.  
2. Airbus press release 12-Jan-2026 – fact: 793 deliveries in 2025; gives family mix. High quality.  
3. AeroTime 06-Feb-2026 – repeats January-2026 figure; quotes CEO on continuing engine-supply problems. Medium quality: reliably reports the 19 figure, CEO remarks are informed but forward-looking opinion.  
4. Simple Flying 10-Feb-2026 – confirms 19 January deliveries; emphasises Boeing comparison. Medium quality, adds no new Airbus numbers.  
5. Bernstein analyst note 16-Feb-2026 – lowers 2026 delivery forecast to 865 (vs market 910). Single expert forecast; moderate evidential weight.  
6. Misc. January 2026/2025 articles – corroborate 2025 total, December-2025 “121” spike, backlog >8 700 aircraft. High factual quality for history; opinion portions (e.g., “supply chain improving”) treated cautiously.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Official January-2026 deliveries = 19 (repeat-confirmed).  
• Historical pattern: Q4, especially December, is disproportionately high; Q1 is the lightest quarter (structural, persistent).  

Moderate evidence  
• Bernstein downgrade to 865 jets for full-year 2026 – single, credible analyst.  
• CEO statement that engines remain “trickiest” – first-hand but subjective.  
• Dozens of “gliders” awaiting engines at 2025 year-end – indicates pent-up deliveries that may clear during Q1.

Weak evidence  
• Media characterisations of Boeing “crushing” Airbus – irrelevant to Airbus March deliveries.  
• Airline route launches, pilot hiring, etc. – peripheral.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
We are six weeks from the end of March 2026. If the forecast horizon were halved (three weeks), I would widen the lower tail slightly: less time to solve engine shortages. If doubled to three months, I would narrow the distribution a little because monthly variability averages out.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view median for March (using 7–9 % of ~820-900 annual deliveries) ≈ 70, with 10th/90th 40–100.  
Adjustments downward:  
• January came in at only 19 (vs 26 & 30 in prior two years) → evidence of weaker start (moderate).  
• Bernstein trims full-year forecast to 865 (moderate).  
• CEO admits supply irritation persists (weak-to-moderate).  
Adjustments upward:  
• “Glider” inventory from late-2025 may be completed once engines arrive, allowing a quarter-end push (moderate).  

Net: nudge the central estimate a bit lower and fatten the lower tail.  

Distribution calibration
10th pct: 35 – reflects possibility engines slip into April.  
20th pct: 45 – a still-weak but improved month.  
40th pct: 58 – lower side of historical “typical March”.  
60th pct: 68 – slightly below previous outside-view median.  
80th pct: 80 – assumes healthy quarter-end catch-up.  
90th pct: 95 – allows for an unusually strong March if many stored aircraft are released.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: count of Airbus commercial aircraft delivered in March 2026, as per official Orders & Deliveries report.  
2. Outside-view base: median ≈ 70, 10th/90th ≈ 40/100.  
3. Consistency check: implied mean ≈ 64; aligns with justification and <70 outside-view mean.  
4. Key evidence: a) Jan-2026 = 19 deliveries, b) persistent engine bottleneck per CEO, c) analyst trims 2026 forecast to 865, d) late-2025 “gliders” could boost Q1.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden surge of engines in mid-March clearing >100 aircraft – would push outcome sharply upward.  
6. Status-quo: typical March in an ~800–900 year is low-70s; I have shifted modestly downward but not dramatically.  
7. Percentiles monotonic, integer counts, within 0-150 band.
