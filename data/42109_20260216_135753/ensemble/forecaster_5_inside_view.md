Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Airbus Orders & Deliveries PDF, 9 Feb 2026: primary data; establishes 19 deliveries in Jan-26. Pure fact, very reliable.  
2. Airbus press release 12 Jan 2026 (“793 deliveries in 2025”): primary data; gives 2025 baseline and confirms dozens of “gliders” awaiting engines.  
3. AeroTime 6 Feb 2026: secondary but reputable; repeats the 19-unit January figure, quotes CEO Faury on “significant supply-chain issues – engines the trickiest part”.  
4. SimpleFlying 10 Feb 2026: secondary; corroborates 19-unit January figure and reiterates backlog of engineless aircraft; adds industry-wide engine bottleneck context.  
5. Bernstein research notes 16 Feb 2026 (AktienCheck et al.): analyst report lowering 2026 delivery forecast to 865 (≈ +9 % vs 2025) vs market 910. One identifiable expert, moderate reliability.  
All other AskNews items concern airlines’ fleet plans, ADs, or macro demand; none alters March-26 physical delivery capacity.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong:  
• Eight-year Airbus March history (mean 60, σ 10) – structural, repeated pattern.  
Moderate:  
• January-26 came in 27 % below Jan-25, hinting that Q1-26 may trail 2025.  
• Bernstein trimming full-year forecast points to lingering constraints.  
Weak:  
• Airline order headlines (Emirates, Delta) – affect long-term backlog, not March output.  
• FAA AD on A350 oxygen clamps – retrofit, no known impact on new-build flow.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome locked 44 days from today; publication ~7–10 days later. If the horizon were halved (22 days), almost all March slots would already have accepted engines, so uncertainty would shrink ~25 %. If doubled (88 days), scope for further supply-chain surprises would widen; tails would fatten slightly.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base-rate anchor: March µ ≈ 60.  
Adjustments downward:  
• January undershoot (-27 % YoY) = moderate evidence.  
• CEO and analyst commentary stress continuing engine shortages.  
• Only six weeks remain – limited time to clear the glider pile before 31 Mar.  
Adjustments upward:  
• Gliders mean any engine catch-up converts quickly into deliveries (strong causal link).  
• Airbus still targets > 820 monthly-rate equivalent by 2027 and needs cadence recovery; pressure on plants to push hard at quarter-end.

Net: modest downward shift of the mean (≈ -8) and slight widening of the lower tail. Upper tail left almost intact because a last-week surge remains plausible.

Distribution calibration

Outside-view (unadjusted) percentiles: 40/45/55/60/68/75  
Inside-view (after adjustments):

10th = 35 (lower tail fattened toward Covid-type shortfall)  
20th = 40  
40th = 48  
60th = 55 (median/mean pull-down of ~5)  
80th = 63  
90th = 72

Checklist:  
1. Target: Count of Airbus commercial aircraft delivered during March 2026 (00:00 UTC 1 Mar – 23:59 UTC 31 Mar).  
2. Outside-view distribution referenced and transparently adjusted.  
3. Implied median ≈ 52 – 55; mean ≈ 53; aligns with rationale (below long-term 60 but well above January 19).  
4. Key evidence: a) Jan-26 = 19 (slow start); b) historical March mean 60; c) CEO cites engine shortages; d) glider backlog allows rapid catch-up; e) Bernstein trims 2026 outlook to 865.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden engine delivery breakthrough in mid-March could push count > 75. Would drive outcome up.  
6. Status-quo pull: Airbus almost never drops below 40 in March unless in crisis – kept 20th = 40.  
7. Percentiles monotonically increasing, units = aircraft, all within open-upper-bound instructions.
