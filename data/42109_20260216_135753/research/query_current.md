Analysis:
To forecast March 2026 Airbus deliveries, I need the most up-to-date signals on: 1) Airbus’ official 2026 delivery guidance and whether it has been reiterated or revised; 2) January–February 2026 delivery numbers (to anchor a trend line toward March); 3) production-rate ramps for A320neo, A220, A330neo, A350, and any known bottlenecks (engines, cabin suppliers, geopolitics) that could accelerate or delay March hand-overs; 4) commentary from Airbus executives, airlines awaiting March slots, and Tier-1 suppliers; and 5) analyst or trade-press estimates of monthly or Q1 2026 deliveries. Current news articles, earnings calls, and industry reports published in the last few weeks are therefore most relevant.
