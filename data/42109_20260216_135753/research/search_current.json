The airline is intensifying its global hiring campaign, aiming to recruit over 1,500 pilots within the next two years, with 550 planned hires for 2026 alone. The company is also seeking 17,300 professionals across 350 roles by the end of the fiscal year. Open days will be held on March 2 at 10:00 and 13:00, and on March 3 at 10:00, with no pre-registration required and candidates expected to attend only one session. During the events, applicants can learn about Emirates' selection process, training programs, career prospects, benefits, and interact directly with current Emirates pilots. The airline has a significant presence in Italy, with over 200 Italian pilots\u2014ranking fifth among the 116 nationalities represented\u2014and more than 900 Italian flight attendants, placing Italy in the top ten for employee numbers. This reflects the strategic importance of Italy for Emirates, especially as the airline expands its network to 152 destinations and introduces new aircraft like the A350 and Boeing 777X. Emirates has ordered 65 Boeing 777-9 and 8 Airbus A350-900 aircraft worth $41.4 billion, bringing its total wide-body aircraft orders to 375, with deliveries scheduled through 2038. The company has already received 13 A350s and will operate a fully modern wide-body fleet. Emirates is also expanding services to Italy, including the launch of Premium Economy on all Milan routes and the introduction of the A350 to Bologna and Rome starting March 29, 2026.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 11:47 AM\nSource:[Sky](https://tg24.sky.it/lavoro/2026/02/16/emirates-selezioni-piloti-milano)\n\n**Most Used Aircraft in 2025, Safety Data, and New Energy Challenges**\nAccording to data from ch-aviation and reported by Corriere, 2025 was one of the safest years ever for air travel, despite ongoing challenges in maintaining high safety standards. In 2025, there were 8 major aviation disasters involving 38.9 million flights and 5 billion passengers, resulting in 362 fatalities. The International Air Transport Association (IATA) forecasts a 4.9% increase in passenger traffic for 2026, driven by a 7.3% growth in the Asia-Pacific region. The Boeing 737-800 was the most flown single-aisle aircraft with 8.4 million flights and the highest number of incident reports (158), followed by the Airbus A320-200 (5.7 million flights, 136 reports) and the A320-200neo (2.9 million flights, 50 reports). IATA emphasizes that incident rates should be analyzed relative to total takeoffs and landings for accurate assessment. Regionally, Europe is expected to have the highest net profit, led by Turkey, while the Middle East will have the highest profit margins. The Asia-Pacific region is the fastest-growing, Latin America shows structural improvement, and North America faces stagnation in domestic demand and operational constraints. IATA\u2019s December 2025 report highlights that while artificial intelligence and commercial flows offer opportunities for cargo transport, they are less effective for global energy transition. Rising electricity demand from data centers intensifies competition for renewable energy, threatening affordable sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) production and potentially delaying aviation decarbonization without coordinated policy prioritizing renewables and safeguarding liquid fuel needs.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 11:17 AM\nSource:[Sky](https://tg24.sky.it/mondo/2026/02/16/ati-sicurezza-aerei-piu-utilizzati-mondo)\n\n**Airbus Stock Analysis: 2026 Deliveries Pose Challenge \u2013 Bernstein Stays Optimistic but Cautious**\nBernstein Research has updated its Airbus SE (AIR) stock analysis as of February 16, 2026, lowering its price target from 240 EUR to 234 EUR while maintaining its 'outperform' rating. The current Xetra trading price is 194.38 EUR, implying a theoretical upside potential of approximately 20.4% based on the new target. Analyst Douglas Harned states that there are no major risks expected for Airbus's upcoming annual results, a key sentiment for investors. Despite the reduced price target, Bernstein remains optimistic, emphasizing that Airbus continues to have an above-average opportunity profile. The core focus of the analysis centers on delivery performance, particularly for 2026, which Bernstein views as a critical test. Harned adjusted his forecast from 900 to 865 aircraft deliveries, reflecting a more disciplined model. This contrasts with the market consensus of 910 deliveries, creating a potential for surprise if actual deliveries exceed expectations. The reduction in the forecast is not driven by pessimism but by a more conservative and realistic assessment of 2026 delivery challenges.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 10:39 AM\nSource:[Aktien Check](https://www.aktiencheck.de/analysen/Artikel-Airbus_Aktienanalyse_2026_Auslieferungen_werden_zur_Huerde_Bernstein_bleibt_optimistisch_aber_vorsichtig-19475473)\n\n**Bernstein Lowers Airbus Target to 234 Euros \u2013 Maintains 'Outperform' Rating**\nBernstein Research has lowered its price target for Airbus from 240 to 234 euros but maintained its 'Outperform' rating.

The aircraft will enable EgyptAir to compete strongly in long-haul markets, allowing non-stop flights from Cairo to Los Angeles, Chicago, Beijing, and Shanghai, thereby enhancing Cairo's role as a global transit hub between Africa, Europe, the Americas, and Asia. Simelas expressed pride in delivering the A350-900 to EgyptAir, noting it is the first such aircraft in North Africa. He highlighted the 50-year partnership between Airbus and Egypt, beginning in 1977 with the delivery of the first A300. EgyptAir's order began with 10 aircraft in 2023 and expanded by six more at the Dubai Airshow, totaling 16 aircraft to be delivered incrementally. Simelas projected that the Middle East will need over 4,000 new aircraft in the next 20 years, with 42% of demand for wide-body aircraft like the A350 due to high long-haul travel demand. The A350 is made of 70% advanced materials, making it lighter and stronger, and offers 25% lower fuel consumption and carbon emissions. While acknowledging supply chain challenges, Simelas affirmed Airbus's priority to meet delivery commitments. He noted full capacity on an A380 flight from Dubai to Cairo, reflecting strong regional air travel demand, and emphasized the growing role of low-cost carriers in driving growth. Rising demand for single-aisle aircraft signals a boom in the sector, reinforcing Airbus's outlook for thousands of new aircraft needed to support regional expansion in both economy and medium-haul markets.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 08:00 AM\nSource:[\u0635\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f](https://www.elbalad.news/6870713)\n\n**Airbus Delivers Nearly 800 Commercial Aircraft in 2025, Records New Order Milestone**\nAirbus, headquartered in Toulouse, reported its 2025 results on January 12, 2026.

In September, the company delivered 73 aircraft, bringing the total to 507 for the first nine months of the year, still below the 820 goal. Delays earlier in the year were primarily due to late delivery of engines to Airbus assembly plants, which caused a backlog of up to 60 partially assembled aircraft waiting for engines\u2014now reduced. An executive stated, 'Creemos que lo podemos conseguir,' expressing confidence in achieving the target. In 2024, Airbus delivered 766 aircraft, falling short of its revised target of 770, which had been lowered mid-year due to supply chain bottlenecks. The company is increasing production cadence, particularly for its A320 single-aisle family, aiming to produce 75 units per month by 2027. Additionally, the integration of Spirit's assets\u2014acquired in the Boeing-Airbus asset division\u2014should be completed by the fourth quarter of 2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 06:29 PM\nSource:[Portafolio.co](https://www.portafolio.co/negocios/empresas/airbus-percibe-mejoras-y-espera-cumplir-su-meta-de-entregar-820-aviones-en-2025-642021)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
