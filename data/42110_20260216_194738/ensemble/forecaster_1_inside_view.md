Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Outside View Sources (Pre-Feb 16, 2026):**

1. **Marquette Law School Poll (Oct 2025)**: High-quality academic polling source. Shows extremely low name recognition for both candidates (15-16%), with only 6% of voters hearing "a lot" about the race. Both candidates have minimal favorability ratings (7% each). This is factual baseline data showing the race started with neither candidate well-known.

2. **PBS Wisconsin interviews (multiple dates)**: Public broadcaster providing candidate platforms. Taylor emphasizes reproductive rights and characterizes Lazar as "extreme" on abortion. These are primarily Taylor's opinions about her opponent, not independently verified facts.

3. **Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Feb 10, 2026)**: Reputable state newspaper. Reports Taylor raised $820K in January 2026 alone, totaling ~$3.4M. First TV ad launched Feb 10 in Madison, Milwaukee, Green Bay markets. Strong factual evidence of massive fundraising advantage.

4. **PBS Wisconsin candidate profiles (Feb 2026)**: Factual biographical information. Taylor: former Planned Parenthood policy director, State Assembly member (2011), Dane County judge (2020), Appeals Court (2023). Lazar: private practice, AG's office under Republican Van Hollen, Waukesha County judge (2015), Appeals Court (2022). Both are credible judicial candidates.

**AskNews Articles (Feb 15-16, 2026):**

5. **WisPolitics (Jan 30, 2026)**: Reports single debate scheduled March 25. Lazar campaign claims they accepted four debate invitations; Taylor declined others. Mix of fact (debate date confirmed) and campaign spin (debate invitation claims).

6. **Journal Sentinel (Jan 29, 2026)**: Confirms March 25 debate at Marquette Law School, moderated by WISN journalists. Provides candidate backgrounds. Notes election won't change ideological balance but could expand liberal majority from 4-3 to 5-2. Factual reporting.

7. **Journal Sentinel (Jan 22, 2026)**: Reports Taylor raised $2.6M by mid-January vs. Lazar's $200K. Election April 7, 2026. Current court is 4-3 liberal. Factual fundraising and structural information.

8. **Yahoo/Journal Sentinel (Oct 1, 2025)**: Profile of Lazar emphasizing her conservative credentials, work on Act 10, voter ID, and abortion cases as assistant AG. Democratic operatives quoted criticizing her as partisan. Mix of biographical facts and political opinions.

**Non-Wisconsin Supreme Court Articles**: Multiple articles about Indian Supreme Court, Hungarian elections, Kerala Bar Council, etc. are irrelevant to this question.

**Quality Assessment**: Wisconsin-specific sources are credible and recent. The massive fundraising disparity ($3.4M vs. $200K+) is consistently reported across multiple independent sources. No public polling exists beyond the October 2025 baseline showing neither candidate was known. The lack of current polling is a significant information gap.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Fundraising disparity** (Multiple sources: Journal Sentinel Jan 22, Feb 10): Taylor $3.4M vs. Lazar $200K-$400K. This 8-17x advantage is independently verified and represents structural campaign capacity. In modern judicial races, this level of resource disparity typically predicts outcomes.

2. **Recent electoral pattern** (Outside view reference class): Liberals won 2023 (55.4%) and 2025 (55.0%) spring Supreme Court races by ~10 percentage points. This is a strong, consistent pattern across two consecutive cycles with similar dynamics.

3. **Early advertising advantage** (Journal Sentinel Feb 10): Taylor launched first TV ads on Feb 10 in three major markets, with ads running through April 7. Lazar has not yet advertised. First-mover advantage in low-information races is significant.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Lower stakes** (Multiple sources): Election won't flip court majority (4-3 liberal remains regardless). This could reduce liberal turnout/enthusiasm compared to 2023/2025 when control was at stake. However, effect size is uncertain.

2. **Candidate backgrounds** (PBS Wisconsin, Journal Sentinel): Both are Appeals Court judges with relevant experience. Lazar has stronger conservative credentials (AG's office, Waukesha County), Taylor has stronger liberal credentials (Planned Parenthood, Dane County). Neither has obvious disqualifying factors.

3. **Single debate** (WisPolitics Jan 30): Only one debate scheduled for March 25, 13 days before election. Lazar campaign claims Taylor declined other debates. If true, this could indicate Taylor's strategy to protect her lead, but single debate limits Lazar's opportunity to shift dynamics.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Debate invitation claims** (WisPolitics): Lazar campaign says they accepted four invitations; Taylor declined. This is campaign spin without independent verification. Even if true, impact depends on debate performance.

2. **Endorsements** (Outside view): Wisconsin Conservation Voters endorsed Taylor. Single organizational endorsement has limited predictive power in judicial races.

3. **Candidate messaging** (PBS Wisconsin): Taylor characterizes Lazar as "extreme" on abortion. This is campaign rhetoric, not independently verified fact. Effectiveness depends on voter receptivity.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 50 days from Feb 16, 2026 to April 7, 2026 election.

**If halved (25 days)**: With only 25 days, Taylor's current advantages (fundraising, early advertising, first-mover) would be more decisive. Lazar would have insufficient time to raise money, build name recognition, or shift dynamics. I would increase Taylor's probability to 80-85%.

**If doubled (100 days)**: With 100 days, Lazar would have more opportunity to raise funds, outside groups could mobilize, and the single debate (still 13 days before election) would have more time for impact to disseminate. However, Taylor's massive early fundraising advantage would still be difficult to overcome. I would decrease Taylor's probability slightly to 70-72%, but the structural advantages would remain.

**Current 50-day assessment**: This is enough time for meaningful campaign dynamics but not enough for Lazar to fully overcome the resource disparity. The March 25 debate is positioned optimally for potential impact (13 days before election), but Lazar needs to perform exceptionally well to shift a race where she's massively outspent.

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate**: Outside view established 75% Taylor / 24% Lazar / 1% Someone else, based on:
- Recent spring elections: Liberals won 55.4% (2023) and 55.0% (2025)
- No conservative spring win since 2019
- Structural shift in spring electorate favoring liberals

**Factors Warranting Adjustment from Base Rate:**

**Upward for Taylor (stronger than base rate suggests):**
1. **Extreme fundraising advantage**: $3.4M vs. $200K-$400K is even more lopsided than typical. This 8-17x disparity exceeds normal campaign resource differences and suggests Lazar may struggle to achieve basic campaign visibility.

2. **First-mover advertising**: Taylor's Feb 10 ad launch in three major markets with continuous run through election gives her 56 days of advertising vs. Lazar's unknown (possibly zero) advertising. In low-information judicial races, this is highly significant.

3. **Consistent pattern**: Two consecutive 10-point liberal wins suggests structural shift, not anomaly. The pattern is strengthening, not weakening.

**Downward for Taylor (weaker than base rate suggests):**
1. **Lower stakes**: Unlike 2023/2025, court majority isn't flipping. This could reduce liberal turnout or enthusiasm. However, the magnitude of this effect is uncertain and may be offset by Taylor's resource advantages.

2. **Time for outside spending**: 50 days allows conservative outside groups to potentially engage, though no evidence of this yet. Past races saw late outside spending, but Lazar's weak fundraising may signal lack of outside interest.

**Net Assessment**: The extreme fundraising disparity and early advertising advantage are more significant than the "lower stakes" factor. The 8-17x resource advantage is structural and difficult to overcome in 50 days. However, the lack of polling creates genuine uncertainty about current voter sentiment.

**Adjustment from Base Rate**: The evidence supports maintaining or slightly increasing Taylor's probability from the 75% base rate. The fundraising disparity is more extreme than typical, and the early advertising advantage compounds this. However, I'll exercise caution given the absence of polling and the possibility of late dynamics.

## Probability Calibration

**Status Quo Continuation**: If current trends continue (Taylor's resource advantage, early advertising, no major outside spending for Lazar), Taylor wins comfortably, likely by 8-12 percentage points similar to 2023/2025.

**Probability Precision Check**:
- 75% (3:1 odds): Lazar has 1-in-4 chance. This seems appropriate given her credible credentials but massive resource disadvantage.
- 80% (4:1 odds): Lazar has 1-in-5 chance. This would reflect even higher confidence in Taylor's structural advantages.
- 70% (7:3 odds): Lazar has 3-in-10 chance. This would give more weight to uncertainty and potential late dynamics.

**Calibration Decision**: The extreme fundraising disparity ($3.4M vs. $200K-$400K) and early advertising advantage warrant a slight upward adjustment from the 75% base rate. However, the lack of polling and 50-day timeframe create genuine uncertainty. I'll adjust to 77% Taylor, reflecting:
- High confidence in structural advantages
- Recognition that 8-17x fundraising advantage is exceptional
- Acknowledgment that judicial races can be volatile
- Conservative approach given no polling data

**"Someone else" probability**: Wisconsin allows write-ins, but no credible third candidate has emerged. The primary is Feb 17 (tomorrow), and only Taylor and Lazar are on the ballot. Write-in campaigns require organization and visibility, neither of which exists. Maintain 1% for this option.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Wisconsin Supreme Court election April 7, 2026. Winner determined by most votes. Options: Maria Lazar (conservative), Chris Taylor (liberal), or someone else.

2. **Base rate**: 75% Taylor / 24% Lazar / 1% Someone else from outside view, based on recent spring election patterns (liberals winning by ~10pp) and structural factors.

3. **Consistency check**: Most likely = Chris Taylor (77%); Least likely = Someone else (1%). This aligns with massive fundraising advantage, recent electoral patterns, and lack of credible third candidate.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - Taylor's $3.4M vs. Lazar's $200K-$400K fundraising (8-17x advantage) - verified by multiple Journal Sentinel reports
   - Liberals won last two spring races by ~10 points (2023: 55.4%, 2025: 55.0%) - factual election results
   - Taylor launched first TV ads Feb 10, running through election; Lazar not yet advertising - verified Journal Sentinel Feb 10
   - Single debate March 25, limiting Lazar's opportunity to shift dynamics - verified WisPolitics Jan 30
   - No public polling exists beyond Oct 2025 baseline showing neither candidate known - factual information gap

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Conservative outside groups mobilize massive late spending (as in 2023/2025) specifically for Lazar, overwhelming Taylor's early advantage. This could shift probabilities to 60% Taylor / 38% Lazar / 2% Someone else. However, Lazar's weak fundraising suggests outside groups may not view this race as priority given court majority isn't at stake.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Current trajectory strongly favors Taylor. The world changes slowly, and with 50 days remaining, the massive resource disparity is difficult to overcome. A slight nudge toward status quo (Taylor winning) is warranted, supporting the 77% probability.

7. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, are between 0-100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [22, 77, 1]
