Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (Wisconsin Court System & Elections Commission):**
- **Wisconsin Courts Third Branch eNews (Dec 2025)**: Official announcement from Wisconsin Court System. High quality, factual. Confirms two candidates (Taylor & Lazar), election date April 7, 2026, and that Justice Bradley won't seek re-election.

**News Media Sources:**
- **Ballotpedia (accessed Feb 2026)**: Comprehensive reference. High quality for factual data. Key facts: Taylor raised $2M vs. Lazar's $198K (July-Dec 2025); liberals currently hold 4-3 majority; recent spring elections showed liberals winning 55.4% (2023) and 55.0% (2025); last conservative win was 2019 at 50.2%.

- **Milwaukee Journal Sentinel (Feb 10-13, 2026)**: Reputable state newspaper. Reports Taylor launching first TV ad with $820K raised in January 2026 alone, totaling ~$3.4M campaign-to-date. Factual reporting on fundraising advantage.

- **WisPolitics (Jan 30, 2026)**: State political news service. Reports single debate scheduled for March 25. Lazar campaign claims they accepted four debate invitations but Taylor declined others. Mix of fact and campaign spin.

- **PBS Wisconsin (Feb 11, 2026)**: Public broadcaster. Video interview with Taylor but limited extractable facts beyond confirming her candidacy and liberal alignment.

**Agent Report:**
Synthesizes multiple sources dated before Feb 16, 2026. Key additional facts:
- Taylor: ~$2.8M raised cycle-to-date with 19K contributions
- Lazar: ~$0.39M cycle-to-date with 357 January donors
- No public polling available
- Wisconsin Conservation Voters endorsed Taylor
- Recent statewide results: Biden +0.63% (2020), Trump +0.9% (2024) in presidential; Evers +3.4% (2022 governor)
- Spring Supreme Court races show consistent liberal advantage: 2023 (+10.8pp), 2025 (+10.0pp)

**Quality Assessment**: Sources are credible and factual. The agent report appropriately distinguishes facts from speculation. No polling data exists, which is a significant information gap.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Wisconsin Supreme Court elections 2019-2025**: Most directly relevant. Shows:
   - 2019: Conservative win 50.2%-49.7% (narrow)
   - 2023: Liberal win 55.4%-44.6% (+10.8pp)
   - 2025: Liberal win 55.0%-45.0% (+10.0pp)
   - Pattern: Liberals have dominated spring elections since 2023

2. **Wisconsin statewide elections (all types)**: Broader but less relevant due to different electorates. Presidential/November races are much closer (margins <1-3pp) than spring judicial races.

3. **Judicial elections nationwide with similar dynamics**: Too heterogeneous; Wisconsin's unique political environment and recent patterns make this less useful.

**Selected Reference Class**: Wisconsin Supreme Court elections 2019-2025, with primary weight on 2023-2025 spring elections as most recent and relevant to current electoral dynamics.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 50 days from Feb 16, 2026 to April 7, 2026 election.

**Historical Patterns Over Similar Periods:**
- Spring Supreme Court elections in Wisconsin occur in low-turnout environments compared to November
- 2025 spring turnout: 50% (record for non-presidential spring)
- 2023 spring turnout: 39.7%
- These elections have become highly nationalized and polarized since 2023

**Relevant Temporal Factors:**
- Campaign is in mid-stage; Taylor has aired first ads (Feb 10)
- Single debate scheduled for March 25 (13 days before election)
- Outside spending hasn't materialized yet but historically arrives late
- No polling to track momentum or name recognition

## (d) Justification

**Factors Favoring Taylor:**
1. **Massive fundraising advantage**: 7-10x more money raised ($2.8M vs. $0.39M)
2. **Recent electoral pattern**: Liberals won last two spring races by ~10 percentage points
3. **Structural advantage**: Spring electorates have favored liberals since 2023
4. **Early advertising**: First on air with TV ads in major markets
5. **Endorsements**: Has begun securing organizational support (Wisconsin Conservation Voters)

**Factors Favoring Lazar:**
1. **Lower stakes**: Liberal majority secure regardless of outcome (4-3 vs. 5-2) may reduce liberal turnout/enthusiasm
2. **Conservative base**: Waukesha County background, former GOP administration official
3. **Potential late spending**: Conservative outside groups spent heavily in past races
4. **Debate opportunity**: Single debate could shift dynamics if Lazar performs strongly

**Factors Creating Uncertainty:**
1. **No polling data**: Cannot assess name recognition, candidate favorability, or current standing
2. **Outside spending unknown**: Past races saw $56M+ (2023) and $100M+ (2025); unclear if similar spending will materialize
3. **Turnout model**: Whether 2023-2025 spring patterns persist without majority control at stake
4. **Time remaining**: 50 days allows for campaign dynamics to shift

**Base Rate from Reference Class:**
- 2023: Liberal 55.4%
- 2025: Liberal 55.0%
- Average: Liberal ~55.2%

However, adjustments needed for:
- Lower perceived stakes (majority not flipping)
- Massive fundraising disparity favoring Taylor
- No conservative win in spring since 2019
- Lazar's resource disadvantage may prevent effective campaign penetration

Outside View Calibration:

The reference class strongly favors the liberal candidate (Taylor), with liberals winning the last two spring Supreme Court races by approximately 10 percentage points. The 55% baseline for liberal candidates in recent spring elections is well-established.

**Calibration Considerations:**

1. **Tethering to established distributions**: The 55-45 split in 2023 and 2025 provides a strong anchor. Taylor's massive fundraising advantage and early advertising suggest she should perform at least as well as recent liberal candidates, possibly better.

2. **Probability precision**: 
   - 90% (9:1 odds) would suggest Lazar has only 1-in-10 chance
   - 80% (4:1 odds) suggests 1-in-5 chance for Lazar
   - 70% (7:3 odds) suggests 3-in-10 chance for Lazar

3. **Rate of upsets**: 
   - Conservatives haven't won a spring race since 2019 (7 years ago)
   - The 2019 race was extremely close (50.2%-49.7%)
   - Recent pattern suggests structural shift in spring electorate
   - However, judicial races can be volatile; outside spending could materialize late

4. **Uncertainty factors**:
   - No polling creates genuine uncertainty about current state
   - 50 days is enough time for dynamics to shift
   - Lower stakes might reduce turnout differentially
   - "Someone else" option: Wisconsin allows write-ins, but no credible third candidate has emerged; this should be minimal (<1%)

**Calibrated Assessment**:
Given the strong recent pattern (2 consecutive liberal wins by ~10pp), Taylor's massive resource advantage, and lack of evidence suggesting a shift in the spring electorate, I assess Taylor's probability at 75-80%. This reflects:
- High confidence in the established pattern
- Recognition that fundraising disparities matter significantly
- Acknowledgment of genuine uncertainty from lack of polling
- Conservative possibility of late outside spending or campaign dynamics shifting

The 75% probability represents 3:1 odds, suggesting Lazar has roughly a 1-in-4 chance. This seems appropriate given:
- She's a credible candidate (Appeals Court judge)
- Conservative outside groups could still engage heavily
- Lower stakes might affect turnout models
- 50 days allows for meaningful campaign effects

Outside View Prediction:
Maria Lazar: 24%
Chris Taylor: 75%
Someone else: 1%
