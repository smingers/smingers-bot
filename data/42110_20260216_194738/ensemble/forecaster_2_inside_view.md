Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (Wisconsin-specific):**

1. **Marquette Law School Poll (Oct 2025)** - High-quality academic polling from Wisconsin's most respected political survey. Factual data showing both candidates at ~15% name recognition, roughly equal favorability (7-8% favorable each). No clear leader evident. Date: 4 months before election.

2. **PBS Wisconsin interviews (multiple dates, Jan-Feb 2026)** - Public broadcaster, credible. Contains both factual information (candidate backgrounds, fundraising) and opinions from Chris Taylor herself about her opponent. Taylor's characterizations of Lazar as "extreme" on abortion are campaign messaging, not expert analysis.

3. **Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel (Feb 10, 2026)** - Major state newspaper, highly credible. **Strong factual evidence**: Taylor raised $820K in January 2026 alone, totaling $3.4M. First to launch TV ads with six-figure buy across major markets. Date: 6 days before today.

4. **Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel (Jan 22, 2026)** - Same outlet. **Key factual data**: By mid-January, Taylor raised $2.6M vs Lazar's $200K (13:1 ratio). Date: 25 days before today.

5. **WisPolitics (Jan 29-30, 2026)** - Reputable state political news. Factual: Single debate scheduled for March 25, 2026. Lazar claims she accepted "at least four" debate invitations while Taylor accepted only one. This suggests possible strategic differences but limited predictive value.

6. **PBS Wisconsin candidate profiles** - Factual backgrounds: Taylor (former Democratic legislator, Planned Parenthood director, appointed by Evers 2020, elected to appeals court 2023). Lazar (former GOP AG office attorney under Van Hollen, elected Waukesha judge 2015, appeals court 2022). Clear ideological alignment with respective parties despite "non-partisan" label.

**Secondary/Irrelevant Sources:**
- Multiple articles about Indian Supreme Court, Hungarian elections, Kerala Bar Council, Guatemala courts - completely irrelevant to Wisconsin race.
- James Carville rant about general Democratic prospects - too general, no Wisconsin-specific insight.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Fundraising disparity** (Multiple sources: Journal-Sentinel Jan 22 & Feb 10): Taylor has 10-13x fundraising advantage ($3.4M vs ~$200-300K). In Wisconsin Supreme Court races, fundraising strongly correlates with vote share. Historical pattern: 2023 Protasiewicz raised $9.8M and won by 11pp; 2020 Karofsky raised more and won by 10pp. **This is structural advantage that's difficult to overcome in 51 days.**

2. **Early advertising advantage** (Journal-Sentinel Feb 10): Taylor launched first TV ads across Madison, Milwaukee, Green Bay - the three largest media markets covering ~70% of state population. With 51 days until election and Lazar not yet on air, Taylor is defining the race. Historical pattern: In 2019 (the last non-majority-control race), Hagedorn came from behind partly through late advertising, but he had comparable resources. Lazar doesn't.

3. **Recent liberal momentum in Wisconsin Supreme Court races** (Outside view + PBS context): Liberals won 2023 by 11pp, 2025 by similar margin. Post-Dobbs environment has consistently favored liberal judicial candidates in Wisconsin. This is demonstrated structural shift.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Majority control not at stake** (PBS Wisconsin, multiple sources): Current 4-3 liberal majority guaranteed through 2028. Historical precedent from 2019 shows this can depress liberal turnout and narrow margins. However, 2019 was pre-Dobbs; abortion remains salient issue even without majority control at stake.

2. **Low name recognition for both candidates** (Marquette Poll Oct 2025): At 15-16% each with equal favorability, this was a blank slate 4 months ago. The candidate who defines themselves first typically wins. Taylor's early advertising advantage is critical here.

3. **Candidate backgrounds** (PBS Wisconsin): Taylor's Planned Parenthood background and legislative record gives her clear messaging on abortion issue. Lazar's AG office work under GOP administration and Waukesha base (conservative stronghold) signals her ideological positioning. In post-Dobbs Wisconsin, abortion messaging has been decisive.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Debate strategy** (WisPolitics): Lazar accepting more debates while Taylor limits to one could indicate either confidence (Taylor) or desperation (Lazar). With one debate scheduled March 25, this gives Lazar one opportunity to change dynamics, but debates rarely move Wisconsin Supreme Court races more than 2-3pp.

2. **Grassroots vs. big donor fundraising** (PBS Wisconsin, Taylor interview): Taylor claims 15,000 donations under $100 vs Lazar's average of $1,800. This suggests different coalition bases but doesn't directly predict outcome.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Current timeframe: 51 days until April 7, 2026 election**

The primary is February 17 (tomorrow), but with only two candidates, both advance automatically. The meaningful campaign period is these 51 days.

**If timeframe were halved (25 days):** Would increase confidence in Taylor significantly (perhaps 70-75%). With advertising already running and Lazar not yet on air, a shorter timeframe would make it nearly impossible for Lazar to close the resource gap and define herself positively.

**If timeframe were doubled (102 days):** Would decrease confidence in Taylor slightly (perhaps 55-60%). More time allows for: (1) Lazar to potentially close fundraising gap through late outside spending, (2) national conservative groups to recognize the race and invest, (3) potential Taylor missteps or negative information to emerge, (4) voter fatigue with liberal messaging. However, Taylor's current structural advantages would still favor her.

**Critical upcoming dates:**
- Feb 17: Primary (formality)
- March 25: Single debate
- Late March: Likely surge in outside spending
- April 7: Election

We're past the point where Lazar can build name recognition organically. She needs either massive outside spending or a major Taylor error.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view baseline: Taylor 63%, Lazar 35%, Other 2%**

**Factors warranting INCREASE in Taylor probability:**

1. **Fundraising disparity more extreme than historical average**: The 10-13x advantage is larger than typical. Even in 2019 (conservative upset), Hagedorn had roughly 60% of Neubauer's resources. Lazar has ~10%. This suggests outside view may underweight current resource imbalance. **Adjustment: +5pp to Taylor**

2. **Early advertising monopoly**: Taylor is the only candidate on air with 51 days left. In 2019, both candidates were advertising by late February. This first-mover advantage in defining the race is significant. **Adjustment: +3pp to Taylor**

3. **Post-Dobbs environment remains potent**: While 2019 showed lower turnout when majority not at stake, that was pre-Dobbs. The 2023 and 2025 races showed abortion issue drives Wisconsin judicial elections. Taylor's Planned Parenthood background is an asset, not liability, in current environment. **Adjustment: +2pp to Taylor**

**Factors warranting DECREASE in Taylor probability:**

1. **Majority control not at stake**: This is real. Some liberal voters may not prioritize this race. However, the outside view already incorporated a -7pp adjustment for this factor from 2019 precedent. No additional adjustment needed.

2. **Time for outside spending**: 51 days is enough time for national conservative groups to recognize and fund this race if they choose. The Republican State Leadership Committee or similar groups could inject $2-3M in late March. However, there's no evidence yet this is happening. **Adjustment: -2pp from Taylor** (possibility of late spending surge)

3. **Single debate risk**: One debate on March 25 gives Lazar a platform. If she significantly outperforms, could shift 2-3pp. **Adjustment: -1pp from Taylor** (debate risk)

**Net adjustment: +7pp to Taylor, bringing her to 70%**

**Recalibration of "Someone else"**: With only two candidates who have already filed and no indication of write-in campaigns or candidate withdrawal, the 2% for "Someone else" seems appropriate. No adjustment.

## Probability Calibration

**Starting point (Outside view):** Taylor 63%, Lazar 35%, Other 2%

**Adjustments based on inside view:**
- Extreme fundraising disparity: +5pp Taylor
- Early advertising monopoly: +3pp Taylor  
- Post-Dobbs environment strength: +2pp Taylor
- Late outside spending possibility: -2pp Taylor
- Single debate risk: -1pp Taylor

**Net adjustment: +7pp to Taylor**

**Calibrated probabilities:**
- Chris Taylor: 70%
- Maria Lazar: 28%
- Someone else: 2%

**Calibration check:** 70% represents 7:3 odds (roughly 2.3:1). This feels appropriate given:
- Taylor has overwhelming structural advantages (money, advertising, momentum)
- But Lazar has a realistic path through late outside spending + debate performance + lower liberal turnout
- 28% for Lazar (roughly 1-in-3.5 chance) aligns with historical upset rate in the reference class
- Wisconsin remains competitive state; 10-point swings have occurred in Supreme Court races

**Status quo projection:** If current trends continue (Taylor's advertising dominance, no major outside spending for Lazar, abortion remains salient), Taylor wins by 6-10pp. This supports the 70% probability.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Wisconsin Supreme Court election April 7, 2026. Winner determined by most votes. Two candidates: liberal-backed Taylor vs conservative-backed Lazar.

2. **Base rate:** Outside view established Taylor 63%, Lazar 35%, Other 2% based on open-seat reference class with adjustments for recent trends, majority-control factor, and early fundraising.

3. **Consistency check:** Most likely = Taylor (70%); Least likely = Someone else (2%); Lazar at 28% represents realistic upset scenario. This makes sense given structural advantages for Taylor but Wisconsin's competitive nature and historical upset precedents.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence:**
   - Taylor's 10-13x fundraising advantage ($3.4M vs ~$300K) - factually verified, multiple sources
   - Taylor's early TV advertising monopoly across major markets - factually verified, Journal-Sentinel
   - Post-Dobbs liberal momentum in Wisconsin judicial races (2023, 2025 wins) - factually verified, historical record
   - Majority control not at stake, potentially depressing liberal turnout - factually verified, PBS Wisconsin
   - Only 51 days remaining with Lazar not yet on air - factually verified, current date

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** National conservative groups (RSLC, Judicial Crisis Network) recognize this as winnable and inject $3-5M in late March for Lazar advertising blitz, combined with strong debate performance March 25. This could flip the race. If this occurs, my 70% Taylor forecast would look overconfident. However, no current evidence suggests this mobilization is happening. If it does materialize, would shift to roughly 50-50 race.

6. **Status quo outcome:** Current status quo (Taylor advertising dominance, fundraising advantage, no major outside intervention) leads to Taylor victory. Given 51 days remaining and structural advantages already established, slight nudge toward status quo is warranted. The 70% probability already reflects this.

7. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, no percentage signs, all between 0-100.
