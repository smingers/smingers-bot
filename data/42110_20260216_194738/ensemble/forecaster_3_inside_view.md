Analysis:

1) Resolution / options (checklist #1)
This resolves to the official winner of the April 7, 2026 Wisconsin Supreme Court election: Maria Lazar, Chris Taylor, or (only if neither wins) “Someone else.”

2) Outside-view base rate (checklist #2)
From the provided outside view anchored on WI Supreme Court spring elections and fundamentals:
- Maria Lazar 15
- Chris Taylor 84
- Someone else 1

(a) Source analysis (quality, date, facts vs opinions)

1. Marquette Law School Poll article (dated 2025-10-29 on page; metadata note says date seems wrong; content about 2026)
- Quality: High for survey methodology/horse-race *environmental* facts (name recognition, awareness). Marquette is a premier WI polling institution.
- Key factual takeaways: Extremely low voter awareness; both candidates’ name recognition/favorability very low and similar (15–16% recognition; net favorability near zero).
- Opinion content: Minimal; mostly descriptive.

2. PBS Wisconsin video/article on Chris Taylor (Feb 2026 context)
- Quality: Medium-high for basic race framing and reported fundraising patterns; but includes candidate claims.
- Facts: Confirms candidates and ideological alignments; notes early fundraising edge for Taylor and contribution-count differences.
- Opinions/claims: Taylor’s characterization of Lazar’s positions and “billionaires” influence are partisan claims—directionally informative about messaging, not treated as verified facts.

3. Journal Sentinel (Feb 10–13, 2026): Taylor first TV ad + fundraising
- Quality: High (major state outlet; concrete numbers).
- Facts: Taylor raised ~$820k in Jan and ~$3.4m total; first to TV with a sizable buy running through Election Day.
- Opinion: “big funding edge” framing is interpretive, but the underlying numbers are factual.

4. PBS Wisconsin “face off” explainer (date not specified but contemporaneous)
- Quality: Medium-high; reputable explainer.
- Facts: Two-candidate race; no third challenger; April 7 general; ideological balance not strictly “on the line” though margin could shift (4-3 to 5-2 if Taylor wins).
- Opinion/interpretation: Notes uncertainty about whether spending/turnout will reach 2023/2025 levels—plausible but not certain.

5. WisPolitics / WISN debate set for March 25, 2026 (Jan 29–30, 2026)
- Quality: High for event logistics.
- Facts: Only one debate scheduled; Taylor campaign says it’s her only planned debate; Lazar accepted multiple invitations.
- Opinion: Lazar camp’s criticism that Taylor declined other debates is campaign messaging; the single-debate fact is what matters.

6. Journal Sentinel (Jan 22, 2026) race explainer
- Quality: High.
- Facts: Candidate bios; fundraising comparison as of mid-Jan (Taylor far ahead); mechanics for voting/absentee timeline; court majority context.

7. AskNews items
- Most are irrelevant (India Supreme Court, Hungary election, etc.). Ignore.
- Relevant AskNews: WisPolitics and Journal Sentinel entries already covered above (debate; election mechanics).

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence
1. Fundraising/communication advantage for Taylor (multiple reliable sources: Journal Sentinel + PBS-style reporting)
- Mechanism: Money → earlier/greater ad volume, voter contact, and definition of opponent in low-information race.
- This is a strong, structural campaign advantage over a ~50-day horizon.

2. Two-candidate field with no third challenger (PBS explainer)
- Mechanism: Eliminates vote-splitting and most “Someone else” pathways; concentrates contest into a binary partisan-leaning choice.

Moderate evidence
3. Marquette poll showing extremely low awareness and symmetric low recognition/favorability
- Mechanism: Late-breaking persuasion and partisan cues/ads matter more; increases outcome variance vs a high-salience, well-defined race.
- Also implies “fundraising/air war” could be especially decisive (helps Taylor) but also that turnout composition could swing more than usual (helps underdog if their side’s turnout spikes).

4. Stakes framed as “not changing ideological control” (PBS explainer; WisPolitics/J-S context)
- Mechanism: Could reduce spending/turnout intensity, especially among liberals if they perceive less urgency; could narrow Taylor’s advantage relative to 2023/2025 reference class.
- But it could also reduce conservative urgency too; net effect uncertain, so only moderate.

Weak evidence
5. Debate-count asymmetry (Taylor doing one; Lazar says yes to more)
- Mechanism: Debates rarely move many votes in low-attention judicial races unless a major gaffe occurs; mostly weak/conditional.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time remaining: ~50 days (Feb 16 → Apr 7, 2026).
- If timeframe were halved (~25 days left): I’d rely even more on existing structural factors (fundraising/ad saturation already queued), nudging slightly toward Taylor.
- If timeframe were doubled (~100 days left): more time for late outside spending, scandals, or opinion formation; I’d widen uncertainty and move slightly toward 50/50 relative to my current view (i.e., modestly increase Lazar/upset probability).

(d) Justification: updating from outside view to inside view
Status quo if trends continue: Taylor keeps a major cash advantage, stays first on TV, defines the race in a low-information environment, and benefits from the recent statewide pattern of liberal wins in spring court elections.

Reasons to shift *down* slightly from the outside-view Taylor probability:
- Marquette shows voters are not tuned in and have no clear idea what either stands for; that typically increases variance and makes turnout/late spending shocks more potent.
- Because court control is not directly at stake (4-3 liberal regardless), the “must-win” energy that boosted liberals in 2023/2025 could be less reliable; that makes the 55–45 recent pattern a bit less directly transferable.

Reasons to keep Taylor clearly favored (not a large shift):
- The most concrete, multi-sourced campaign fact is Taylor’s very large fundraising edge and earlier TV presence—particularly valuable in a low-awareness electorate.
- “Someone else” is extremely unlikely with a two-candidate race, absent an extraordinary event (death/withdrawal/major disqualification) close to Election Day.

Probability calibration

Starting point (outside view): Lazar 15 / Taylor 84 / Someone else 1.

Adjustments:
- Decrease Taylor modestly (about 2–4 points) due to (i) lower-salience/stakes and (ii) very low voter awareness increasing upset paths.
- Decrease “Someone else” from 1 to near-zero because the ballot is effectively set with two candidates and the window is short.

Net inside-view forecast:
- Maria Lazar increases to reflect higher-variance/turnout-composition and late-spending upset paths.
- Chris Taylor remains a strong favorite due to money + first-mover TV advantage + recent spring-election environment.
- Someone else ~0.3 for extreme contingencies.

Checklist:
1. Options/criteria: Winner of Apr 7, 2026 WI Supreme Court election among Lazar/Taylor/other. OK.
2. Outside view base rate used: [15, 84, 1]. OK.
3. Consistency: Most likely = Chris Taylor; least likely = Someone else; consistent with evidence. OK.
4. Key evidence (3–5):
   - Taylor ~$3.4m raised and first TV ad buy (Journal Sentinel, Feb 2026).
   - Marquette: voters largely unaware; both candidates low recognition (Oct 2025 poll release).
   - Race doesn’t flip court control; may reduce turnout intensity (PBS explainer).
   - Two-candidate field; no third challenger (PBS explainer).
5. Blind spot: A massive late conservative outside-spending wave plus asymmetric Dem turnout drop in a “low-stakes” year could flip it. This would push Lazar materially higher (e.g., into the 30–40 range).
6. Status quo: Trend favors Taylor given fundraising and recent spring results; keep Taylor favored. OK.
7. Technicals: probs 0–100, sum to 100, no percent signs. OK.

Probabilities: [19.0, 80.7, 0.3]
