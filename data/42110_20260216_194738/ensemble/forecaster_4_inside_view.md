Analysis
========

(a) Source analysis  
1. Marquette Law School Poll, Oct 2025 (web). 700-respondent statewide sample; shows both candidates with 15-16 % name ID, no horse-race question. Good methodology, but four months old and very early. Facts: very low awareness.  
2. PBS Wisconsin “Here & Now” interview, Feb 2026. Video page; confirms candidate line-up and gives Taylor’s self-reported fundraising totals and rhetorical attacks. Reliable for the factual items it reports, opinion for the attacks.  
3. Journal-Sentinel, 10 & 13 Feb 2026. Cites January campaign-finance filings: Taylor $820 k in Jan, $3.4 m total; first six-figure TV buy. High-credibility local paper; figures come from legally filed reports (fact, strong).  
4. PBS Wisconsin explainer, Jan 2026. Recaps court composition, recent spending history, and biographical information. Factual, moderate reliability.  
5. WisPolitics / WISN debate notice, 29-30 Jan 2026. Confirms single 25 Mar debate. Administrative fact, high reliability.  
6. Historical election results (WI Elections Commission database, 2019-2025). Official vote totals: 2019 conservative +0.4 pt; 2023 liberal +11.0 pt; 2025 liberal +9.2 pt. Facts, strongest quality.  
7. AskNews scrape of miscellaneous India/Kerala/Hungary stories – unrelated noise; discarded.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)  
Strong evidence  
• Last two April WI Supreme Court races produced 9-11 pt liberal victories (official results).  
• Taylor holds ≥10:1 cash-on-hand edge ($3.4 m vs ≈$0.3 m per filings). Fundraising is historically correlated with ad volume and vote share in WI judicial races.  
Structural: Madison-Milwaukee college-town turnout is systematically higher than rural in April.

Moderate evidence  
• Court balance not at stake → may dampen liberal motivational edge (single reliable source, logical but unquantified).  
• Only one scheduled debate limits Lazar’s chance for free media.  
• No public horse-race polling; outcome volatility higher.

Weak evidence  
• Early October poll on name recognition (outdated).  
• Speculation about outside conservative “big-money” rescue (possible but unverified).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• 51 days remain until 7 Apr.  
• If the decision horizon were halved (≈25 d), late spending & debate effects would already be priced in – I’d move only 2-3 pts toward Taylor if her money lead persists.  
• If doubled (post-election counterfactual), uncertainty would shrink to zero; current probabilities would converge to either 0 or 100.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Start from outside-view 67 % Taylor / 31 % Lazar / 2 % other.

Shifts upward for Taylor  
+4 pts Large demonstrable fundraising gap (strong).  
+3 pts Momentum of two recent liberal blowouts; electorate composition likely similar (strong).  
Shifts downward for Taylor  
−2 pts Reduced stakes could suppress liberal turnout (moderate).  
−1 pt Possibility of late GOP-aligned independent spending surge (weak–moderate).

Net change: +4 pts for Taylor (67 → 71), −3 pts for Lazar (31 → 28), “Someone else” unchanged at 1 % (tiny risk of ballot shock; earlier 2 % trimmed because filing deadline has passed and both nominees are healthy).

Maria Lazar 28  
Chris Taylor 71  
Someone else 1

------------------------ FORECASTING CHECKLIST ------------------------
1. Options: win = person receiving most votes in the 7 Apr 2026 WI Supreme Court election; choices: Lazar, Taylor, or any other/write-in.  
2. Outside-view base: 67 / 31 / 2.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = Taylor; least likely = Someone else – aligns with evidence.  
4. Key evidence  
   a) 2023 & 2025 liberal wins by ~10 pts.  
   b) Taylor’s $3.4 m vs Lazar’s ≈$0.3 m cash edge.  
   c) Single debate agreed; limits Lazar exposure.  
   d) Seat will not flip court control → modestly lowers liberal turnout.  
5. Blind-spot: A multimillion-dollar conservative independent-expenditure blitz coupled with low urban turnout could swing race. Would raise Lazar to ~45 %.  
6. Status-quo drift favours Taylor (current media, money, recent pattern).  
7. Technicalities: numbers 0-100, sum = 100, no percent signs.

Probabilities: [28, 71, 1]
