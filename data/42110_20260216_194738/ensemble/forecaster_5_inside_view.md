Analysis  

1. Paraphrase of options & resolution criteria (<30 words).  
Winner of the 7 Apr 2026 Wisconsin Supreme Court general election: conservative Maria Lazar, liberal Chris Taylor, or an unexpected write-in/third candidate. Sources after 16 Feb 2026 determine outcome.  

2. Outside-view base rate (open-seat WI Supreme Court races 2007-2025, n = 5).  
Liberals 60 %, Conservatives 40 %, Write-in 0 %.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------  
(a) Source analysis (quality, date, fact vs. opinion)  

• Marquette Law School poll summary (29 Oct 2025, updated): credible academic poll; factual name-ID data; no horse-race numbers – low predictive value.  
• PBS Wisconsin video/article (Feb 2026): public broadcaster; gives candidate frames and early fundraising; opinions come from Taylor interview – treated as advocacy.  
• Journal-Sentinel fund-raising article (10-13 Feb 2026): state paper of record; hard numbers filed at WEC – high quality, factual.  
• WisPolitics debate notice (30 Jan 2026): reliable niche outlet; factual scheduling info.  
• PBS Wisconsin explainer on race (Feb 2026): background; historical spending figures – moderate quality, mainly factual.  
• AskNews aggregation pieces unrelated to WI race (India SC, Hungary, etc.) were discarded as irrelevant noise.  

(b) Evidence weighting  

Strong evidence  
1. Fund-raising filings: Taylor $3.4 m v. Lazar ≈ $0.4 m (Journal-Sentinel, WEC).  
2. Recent pattern 2018-2025: candidate with ≥ 2× financial edge is 3-0 in WI Supreme Court contests.  
3. Liberal victories in last three court races with 4-3, 4-3, 4-3 pre-election margins (structural pattern).  

Moderate evidence  
4. Ideological control not at stake → turnout historically ~10 pp lower (2011, 2015). Lower salience may blunt liberal enthusiasm.  
5. Conservative late-surge precedents (2007, 2019) driven by external independent-expenditure blitzes.  

Weak evidence  
6. Qualitative claims about “extreme positions” (PBS interview) – partisan rhetoric.  
7. No publicly released head-to-head polling yet (absence of data).  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
51 days remain. If the window were halved (≈ 25 days) I would widen my uncertainty band only slightly; late IE money can still move 3-5 pp but seldom ≥ 10 pp. If doubled (≈ 100 days) I would give Lazar an extra 4-5 pp for additional comeback opportunity.  

(d) Justification & inside-view adjustment  

Start at 60 / 40 / 0.  
+8 pp to Taylor (strong evidence 1-3) → 68 / 32.  
−3 pp Taylor, +3 pp Lazar (moderate evidence 4-5) → 65 / 35.  
+2 pp “someone else” tail risk (death, scandal, ballot error) proportionally −1 pp each major → 64 / 34 / 2.  
Re-examine: cash gap is extraordinary (8 : 1) and ad reservation already on-air; liberal brand undefeated since Dobbs. Add back +7 pp to Taylor (weight strong evidence again) → 71 / 27 / 2.  

Probability calibration  
I am 71 % confident Taylor wins, roughly 3 : 1 odds; Lazar retains a live 27 % chance – consistent with two conservative upsets in five analogue races.

Checklist  

• Consistency line: Most likely = Chris Taylor; least likely = Someone else – matches argument.  
• Key evidence (≤ 20 words each)  
  1. Taylor raises $3.4 m v. Lazar $0.4 m through Jan 2026.  
  2. Money-advantaged candidate 3-0 in comparable 2018-25 races.  
  3. Liberals won last three WI Supreme Court elections decisively.  
  4. No polling shows Lazar ahead; none released to counter financial narrative.  
  5. Race does not flip court, dampening overall turnout (potential Lazar upside).  

• Blind-spot scenario: Eight-figure conservative outside-spend blitz + scandal against Taylor drives late opinion swing (cf. 2019) – could flip result.  

• Status-quo nudge: recent liberal momentum + fundraising lead form the current trajectory; forecast already leans that way.
