Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Third Branch eNews, 18 Dec 2025 – Official Wisconsin Court System newsletter announcing the open seat and listing both candidates.  Straightforward facts, no analysis; highly reliable, though dated two months ago.  
2. PBS Wisconsin video page, 11 Feb 2026 – Confirms Chris Taylor is running and is regarded as the liberal in the race.  Primary value is candidate identification; quality is good, but it offers few verifiable numbers.  
3. Ballotpedia “Wisconsin Supreme Court elections, 2026”, continuously updated, last checked 16 Feb 2026 – Collates filings, fundraising totals (through 31 Dec 2025), recent statewide results, and court-balance stakes.  Well-sourced and typically accurate; still secondary, but best single factual repository.  
4. WisPolitics, 30 Jan 2026 – Logistics of the lone televised debate.  Useful for campaign-activity signal; reputable state politics outlet.  
5. Milwaukee Journal–Sentinel, 13 Feb 2026 – Reports Taylor’s January haul ($820 k) and first TV ad; JS is Wisconsin’s paper of record, good factual reliability.  
6. PBS Wisconsin article link (transcript pending) – Adds no new hard data; ignored for quantitative work.  
7. Agent report (compiled 16 Feb 2026) – Synthesises WEC data, prior statewide margins, endorsements, and spending history.  Quality hinges on cited primary sources (WEC canvasses, press releases); cross-checked spot values align with Ballotpedia/JS numbers, so treated as a useful digest, though still second-hand.

All of the above supply descriptive facts; the only opinions are in candidate quotes and pundit speculation, which are not used in the outside view.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate-specific polling is absent, so a base-rate approach is required.  Three plausible classes:  
1. All Wisconsin statewide general elections (Novembers, presidents & governors).  Too heterogeneous: partisan balance flips every cycle and electorate size differs greatly from April elections.  
2. All contested Wisconsin Supreme Court general elections 2007-2025 (10 races).  Same office, same spring calendar, similar turnout environment – strong candidate.  
3. “Open-seat” Wisconsin Supreme Court races only (2007, 2018, 2019, 2023, 2025) – narrows to electorates deciding without an incumbent, which matches 2026 precisely.  

Class 3 is selected for the base rate.

Outcomes in Class 3: Liberals 3 wins (2018, 2023, 2025), Conservatives 2 wins (2007, 2019) → Liberal win rate 60 %, Conservative 40 %.  No “someone else” victories (0 %).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today: 16 Feb 2026.  Election: 7 Apr 2026 → 51 days.  In the five open-seat races since 2007, no candidate who trailed badly in fundraising and was 10 + points behind the prior liberal benchmark managed to reverse the race inside the final 50 days, but two upsets did occur overall (2007 and 2019); both were conservatives who surged very late with heavy outside spending.  Hence, ~40 % upset frequency in the chosen reference class within a similar time window.

(d) Justification  
1. Base rate from Class 3 gives Chris Taylor 60 %.  
2. Fund-raising: Taylor $3.4 m vs. Lazar ≈ $0.4 m so far (≈ 8 : 1).  In Wisconsin Supreme Court races since 2018 the better-funded side is 3-0.  This nudges Taylor upward.  
3. Ideological control not at stake may dampen liberal turnout, pulling the probability back a little.  
4. History of late conservative surges (2007, 2019) argues for a non-negligible upset chance.  
5. “Someone else” can win only via a write-in; write-ins have averaged <0.5 % in recent court races.  Assign a residual 2 % to cover ballots shocks (candidate death, scandal, court-ordered postponement, etc.).

Combining:  
• Start at 60 / 40 base.  
• +10 pp to Taylor for the cash and ad advantage → 70 / 30.  
• −2 pp from Taylor, +2 pp to “someone else” for residual tail risk → 68 / 30 / 2.  
• Result fits the historical 40 % upset rate yet recognises Taylor’s markedly stronger campaign position.

Outside view calibration:

a. Probabilities sum to 100 %.  
b. Anchored to the empirical 60 % liberal win rate in open-seat races, then adjusted modestly (±8 pp) for fundraising and tail risk – in line with typical spring-race volatility.  
c. Upset frequency (40 % in reference class) justifies keeping Lazar at roughly 3 : 7 odds, not lower.  
d. Small probability (2 %) reserved for low-frequency, high-impact events, preventing overconfidence.

Outside View Prediction:
['Maria Lazar', 'Chris Taylor', 'Someone else']  
Maria Lazar: 30 %  
Chris Taylor: 68 %  
Someone else: 2 %
