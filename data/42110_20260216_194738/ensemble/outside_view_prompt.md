</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide background on 2026 Wisconsin Supreme Court election: candidate biographies, prior statewide election margins (2020-2025), recent fundraising totals, endorsements, and any available polling; include Wisconsin Elections Commission data and reputable news sources published before 16 Feb 2026.
1. Overview of the 2026 race  
   • Election date – Tuesday 7 April 2026; a single 10-year seat is on the ballot. (Ballotpedia)  
   • Incumbent – Justice Rebecca Bradley (conservative) announced in Aug. 2025 that she will not seek re-election. (Ballotpedia)  
   • Candidates – because only two filed by the 2 Jan 2026 deadline, the February primary was cancelled and both advance directly to the general:  
        – Judge Chris Taylor (liberal-leaning), Court of Appeals District IV, former Dane County circuit judge and former Democratic state-assembly member (2011-2020). Former policy director for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin; BA University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, JD UW Law. (Ballotpedia; PBS Wisconsin clip 9 Jan 2026)  
        – Judge Maria S. Lazar (conservative-leaning), Court of Appeals District II, former Waukesha County circuit judge and former Wisconsin assistant attorney general. BA Mount Mary U., JD Georgetown. (Ballotpedia; PBS Wisconsin clip 9 Jan 2026)

   Ideological consequence: regardless of winner, the court’s liberal majority will remain at least 4-3. If Taylor wins it would widen to 5-2; if Lazar wins it stays 4-3. (Ballotpedia)

2. Recent fundraising (latest reports filed 31 Jan 2026, covering activity 1 July - 31 Dec 2025 plus January large-donor reports)  
   • Taylor – $2.0 million through 31 Dec 2025; additional $0.82 million in Jan 2026; ≈ $2.8 million cash raised cycle-to-date, 19 k contributions, median <$100. (Ballotpedia note 16; Center Square 10 Feb 2026)  
   • Lazar – $0.198 million through 31 Dec 2025; additional ≈ $0.19 million in Jan 2026; ≈ $0.39 million cycle-to-date, 357 Jan donors, average $525. (Ballotpedia note 17; Center Square 10 Feb 2026; Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel 13 Feb 2026)  
   Outside groups: none have filed independent-expenditure reports yet; both parties spent nine-figure sums in the 2023 and 2025 races, so late-cycle spending is expected. (WisPolitics 12 Feb 2026; Ballotpedia notes 13-14)  

3. Endorsements publicly announced before 16 Feb 2026  
   Chris Taylor  
      – Wisconsin Conservation Voters (WisPolitics press release 12 Feb 2026)  
      – Democratic Party of Wisconsin (implied via joint fundraising in Center Square piece)  
   Maria Lazar  
      – No formal endorsements reported in the searched coverage as of 16 Feb 2026.  

   (Note: Television interviews show both candidates courting law-enforcement and judicial-independence constituencies, but written endorsements are still sparse.)

4. Polling  
   • No public statewide polling specifically testing Taylor vs. Lazar has been released through 16 Feb 2026. Wisconsin Watch (16 Feb 2026) notes that because there was no primary, “no statewide contests appear on the Feb. 17 ballot,” consistent with the absence of polling. Finding: information gap – empirical polling data is not yet available.

5. Context – statewide election results & margins (official canvasses, Wisconsin Elections Commission; historical comps from 270toWin and Marquette Law School analysis)  

   2020-2025 statewide contests and margin (winner listed first):  
   • Nov 2020 – President: Joe Biden +0.63 pp (WEC canvass).  
   • Apr 2023 – Supreme Court: Janet Protasiewicz (L) 55.4 % – Daniel Kelly 44.6 %  (WEC results; Ballotpedia)  margin +10.8 pp.  
   • Nov 2022 – Governor: Tony Evers (D) +3.4 pp; U.S. Senate: Ron Johnson (R) +1.0 pp. (WEC)  
   • Nov 2024 – President: Donald Trump +0.9 pp (270toWin state page; WEC canvass). Turnout 73 % of voting-age population, highest nationally. (Marquette Law School blog 27 Aug 2025)  
   • Apr 2025 – Supreme Court: Susan Crawford (L) 55.0 % – Brad Schimel 45.0 %  margin +10.0 pp; turnout 50 % VAP (WEC; Marquette blog).  
   – Historical note: Conservatives last won a Supreme Court election in 2019 (Brian Hagedorn 50.2 % – Lisa Neubauer 49.7 %). (Ballotpedia)

   These results show a clear pattern: spring Supreme Court electorates have given liberal-backed candidates roughly 55 % of the vote for three straight cycles, while presidential-year November electorates remain razor-thin.

6. Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) election-administration facts  
   • Official, precinct-level results and turnout statistics for every statewide race are published at MyVote.wi.gov Election Results portal. (WEC information page reference in question prompt)  
   • WEC’s canvass reports confirm the vote totals cited above and will be the authoritative source for the 2026 contest after certification.

7. Media coverage themes up to 16 Feb 2026  
   a) Spending gap – Multiple outlets highlight Taylor’s 10-to-1 money advantage and expectation that conservative mega-donors could still engage late (Center Square; Badger Project).  
   b) Reduced stakes compared with 2023/2025 – because the ideological majority is not immediately at risk, fundraising and outside attention are running below record-setting pace (Badger Project 12 Feb 2026).  
   c) Turnout uncertainty – Analysts (Marquette Law blog) note that liberals have built a structural edge in April elections as turnout has soared; whether that persists without a majority-control question remains to be seen.  
   d) Issue salience – Abortion access, legislative redistricting disputes, and checks on a potential Republican legislature are focal points in candidate interviews (PBS Wisconsin “Here & Now” 30 Jan and 9 Jan 2026 clips).

8. Key take-aways for forecasters  
   • Fund-raising and recent April voting history currently favor Chris Taylor.  
   • Conservatives have not topped 45 % in the last two spring races and have not won since 2019; Lazar must broaden the GOP-leaning electorate beyond its recent spring size.  
   • No polling exists yet, so uncertainty around name recognition and campaign effects persists.  
   • Late independent expenditures from conservative groups could narrow the resource gap, as happened in 2019.  
   • Voter fatigue or lower perceived stakes (majority not on the line) could change the turnout model that favored liberals in 2023 and 2025; this represents a major analytic unknown.

9. Remaining information gaps  
   • Public polling of the 2026 matchup – none located.  
   • Comprehensive endorsement lists – only one formal endorsement for Taylor surfaced; trade unions, law-enforcement associations, and newspapers have not yet published endorsements.  
   • Updated campaign-finance disclosures for February – March spending, plus super-PAC/issue-ad expenditures, will be filed in March and early April.  
   • Specific WEC numeric data for historic races (cited qualitatively here) could be tabulated for exact vote totals if needed.

The above addresses the requested background using WEC data sources and reputable news coverage available prior to 16 Feb 2026.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
