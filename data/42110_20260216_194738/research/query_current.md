Analysis:
The key to forecasting this election is understanding (1) whether Court of Appeals Judge Maria Lazar will run statewide as the conservative candidate, (2) how well liberal Justice Chris Taylor is positioned after her 2023 appointment/election, and (3) whether any additional credible candidates are emerging. The most useful current information will therefore cover candidate declarations, party-aligned endorsements, fundraising totals, issue-group spending, and—if available—early polling or primary‐ballot filings. Targeted searches should pull from statewide political reporters (e.g., Milwaukee Journal Sentinel, Wisconsin State Journal), specialized legal outlets, campaign-finance databases, and official Wisconsin Elections Commission releases.
