Analysis:
The key outside-view factors are (1) how Wisconsin has voted in recent statewide judicial contests, (2) the candidates’ current offices, ideological coalitions, fundraising, and endorsements, and (3) any early polling or primary results.  Looking back at the 2020, 2023, and 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court general elections—as well as each candidate’s earlier electoral record—will give base‐rate guidance on vote shares and partisan turnout patterns.  Up-to-date news is needed for campaign finance reports, endorsements, and declared candidacies, while deeper web sources (court bios, past election returns, think-tank analyses) provide historical margins and demographic shifts.
