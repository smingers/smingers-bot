The case stems from a 2018 five-judge bench decision that, by a 4:1 majority, lifted the ban on women aged 10 to 50 entering the Ayyappa shrine, declaring the practice unconstitutional. In 2019, a five-judge bench headed by then Chief Justice Ranjan Gogoi referred the issue to a larger bench, citing the need to examine the broader ambit of religious freedom across faiths. The referral included cases involving Muslim women's entry into mosques and dargahs, and Parsi women married to non-Parsi men seeking access to the holy fire at an Agiary. After a delay due to the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent leadership changes, the court, comprising Chief Justice Surya Kant and Justices Joymalya Bagchi and Vipul M Pancholi, ordered the hearings to be held from April 7 to April 22, 2026. Written submissions are due by March 14, 2026. Solicitor General Tushar Mehta supported the review of the 2018 Sabarimala verdict, while Krishna Kumar Singh was appointed nodal counsel for petitioners seeking review, and Shashwati Pari for those opposing it. Senior advocates K Parameshwar and Shivam Singh were appointed as amici curiae, with Singh required to submit a consolidated position of all parties.

He urged Democrats to adopt 'gallows humor' and 'laugh heartily' at Republicans, stating that doing so would ensure victory in the 2026 midterm elections and the 2028 presidential election. Carville declared, 'We're gonna beat their f--ing a--es come November and the November after that,' and expressed confidence that former Vice President Kamala Harris would win the 2024 presidential election, citing her certainty as a 'fact' in a prior October 2024 New York Times guest essay. He further asserted that a Democratic president would be elected in 2028 and would establish a special transition advisory committee to reform the Supreme Court.

Sudershan Reddy for a Rajya Sabha seat from Telangana, as two seats are set to become vacant in April 2026.

It will be broadcast live and livestreamed on wisn.com and the station\u2019s streaming app, with statewide coverage through partner stations in Green Bay (WBAY), Madison (WKOW), Wausau (WAOW), Eau Claire (WQOW), and La Crosse (WXOW). Shawn Oswald, president and general manager of WISN 12, stated the debate aims to 'bring clarity to the candidates' judicial philosophies, going beyond the campaign ads and an increasingly polarized environment.' The outcome of the April 7 election will not alter the ideological balance of the court but could expand the liberal majority: a Taylor victory would result in a 5-2 liberal majority, while a Lazar win would maintain the current 4-3 split. Taylor, appointed to the Dane County Circuit Court in 2020 by Governor Evers, previously served in the state Legislature for about 10 years and was a public policy director for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin. Lazar, who has served on the Waukesha-based District 2 Court of Appeals since 2022, previously held roles as a Waukesha County judge, assistant attorney general under Republican Attorney General J.B. Van Hollen, and in private legal practice.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 05:37 PM\nSource:[Journal Sentinel](https://eu.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/2026/01/29/date-set-for-lone-wisconsin-supreme-court-election-debate/88405112007/)\n\n**Wisconsin Supreme Court election in April; candidates, date**\nThe Wisconsin Supreme Court election is scheduled for April 7, 2026, with no incumbent justice running, as conservative Justice Rebecca Bradley announced she would not seek re-election. The race features two candidates: liberal candidate Chris Taylor, a former state Democratic lawmaker, Dane County judge, and public policy director for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin, and conservative candidate Maria Lazar, a former assistant attorney general under Gov. Scott Walker and Waukesha County judge. Taylor, who entered the race in late May 2025, raised $2.6 million by mid-January 2026, while Lazar raised $200,000 in the same period. The Wisconsin Supreme Court currently has a liberal majority of 4-3. If Taylor wins, the liberal majority would expand to 5-2; if Lazar wins, the balance would remain 4-3. The election is nonpartisan in form but has become increasingly partisan, with both major parties supporting their preferred candidate. The election is part of a staggered system of 10-year terms, with one justice elected annually through at least 2030. Polls are open from 7 a.m. to 8 p.m. on April 7, 2026, with same-day voter registration available. Absentee ballots must be requested by March 17, and in-person absentee voting begins March 24 in some communities. This race does not alter the court\u2019s ideological majority, unlike the 2025 election that added liberal Justice Susan Crawford.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 06:22 PM\nSource:[Journal Sentinel](https://eu.jsonline.com/story/news/politics/elections/2026/01/22/wisconsin-supreme-court-election-april-candidates-date-voting/88269565007/)\n\n**Point Taken: Meet the Candidates - 2026 Edition**\nIn 2026, Wisconsin will hold two major statewide elections: a April State Supreme Court race following Justice Rebecca Bradley's decision not to seek a second term, opening the door for a new conservative candidate and a liberal challenger, and a November gubernatorial election to succeed Governor Tony Evers, whose term ends in 2027. WTMJ's Steve Scaffidi and Kristin Brey are interviewing candidates for both races, with updates to be published as new interviews become available. The coverage is part of the 'Point Taken: Meet the Candidates - 2026 Edition' series.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 12, 2025 06:30 PM\nSource:[WTMJ](https://wtmj.com/shows/point-taken/2025/10/12/point-taken-meet-the-candidates-2026-edition/)\n\n**Who is Maria Lazar? What to know about conservative Wisconsin Supreme Court candidate**\nMaria Lazar, a conservative candidate and current Wisconsin Court of Appeals judge for District II, is running in the spring 2026 nonpartisan race for the Wisconsin Supreme Court following Justice Rebecca Bradley's decision not to seek re-election. Lazar, who previously served as a Waukesha County Circuit Court judge and assistant attorney general under Republican Gov. Scott Walker from 2010 to 2015, is known for her role as lead counsel in cases involving Act 10, voter ID laws, and abortion regulations. She represented the state in a Planned Parenthood lawsuit over hospital admitting privileges for abortion providers, a case in which current Justice Susan Crawford represented the plaintiff. Lazar\u2019s campaign emphasizes judicial ethics, stating she will not campaign on future rulings but will explain her past decisions. Her candidacy is opposed by Democratic figures, including campaign manager Ashley Franz and Democratic Party of Wisconsin spokesman Philip Shulman, who accuse her of advancing a partisan agenda to restrict abortion rights, voting rights, and working families\u2019 interests. The 2026 race will not change the court\u2019s liberal majority, which is guaranteed through 2028 after Justice Susan Crawford\u2019s 2024 victory. If Lazar wins, the court will remain 4-3 liberal; if Chris Taylor wins, it will become 5-2. The primary for the Supreme Court seat is set for February 17, 2026, with the general election on April 7, 2026. The broader general election, including races for governor and U.S. House, is scheduled for November 3, 2026, with a primary on August 11, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 04:07 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/maria-lazar-know-conservative-wisconsin-160726686.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
