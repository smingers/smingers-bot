Overview of the 2026 race  \n   \u2022 Election date \u2013 Tuesday 7 April 2026; a single 10-year seat is on the ballot. (Ballotpedia)  \n   \u2022 Incumbent \u2013 Justice Rebecca Bradley (conservative) announced in Aug. 2025 that she will not seek re-election. (Ballotpedia)  \n   \u2022 Candidates \u2013 because only two filed by the 2 Jan 2026 deadline, the February primary was cancelled and both advance directly to the general:  \n        \u2013 Judge Chris Taylor (liberal-leaning), Court of Appeals District IV, former Dane County circuit judge and former Democratic state-assembly member (2011-2020). Former policy director for Planned Parenthood of Wisconsin; BA University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee, JD UW Law. (Ballotpedia; PBS Wisconsin clip 9 Jan 2026)  \n        \u2013 Judge Maria S. Lazar (conservative-leaning), Court of Appeals District II, former Waukesha County circuit judge and former Wisconsin assistant attorney general. BA Mount Mary U., JD Georgetown. (Ballotpedia; PBS Wisconsin clip 9 Jan 2026)\n\n   Ideological consequence: regardless of winner, the court\u2019s liberal majority will remain at least 4-3. If Taylor wins it would widen to 5-2; if Lazar wins it stays 4-3. (Ballotpedia)\n\n2. Recent fundraising (latest reports filed 31 Jan 2026, covering activity 1 July - 31 Dec 2025 plus January large-donor reports)  \n   \u2022 Taylor \u2013 $2.0 million through 31 Dec 2025; additional $0.82 million in Jan 2026; \u2248 $2.8 million cash raised cycle-to-date, 19 k contributions, median <$100. (Ballotpedia note 16; Center Square 10 Feb 2026)  \n   \u2022 Lazar \u2013 $0.198 million through 31 Dec 2025; additional \u2248 $0.19 million in Jan 2026; \u2248 $0.39 million cycle-to-date, 357 Jan donors, average $525. (Ballotpedia note 17; Center Square 10 Feb 2026; Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel 13 Feb 2026)  \n   Outside groups: none have filed independent-expenditure reports yet; both parties spent nine-figure sums in the 2023 and 2025 races, so late-cycle spending is expected. (WisPolitics 12 Feb 2026; Ballotpedia notes 13-14)  \n\n3. Endorsements publicly announced before 16 Feb 2026  \n   Chris Taylor  \n      \u2013 Wisconsin Conservation Voters (WisPolitics press release 12 Feb 2026)  \n      \u2013 Democratic Party of Wisconsin (implied via joint fundraising in Center Square piece)  \n   Maria Lazar  \n      \u2013 No formal endorsements reported in the searched coverage as of 16 Feb 2026.  \n\n   (Note: Television interviews show both candidates courting law-enforcement and judicial-independence constituencies, but written endorsements are still sparse.)\n\n4. Polling  \n   \u2022 No public statewide polling specifically testing Taylor vs. Lazar has been released through 16 Feb 2026. Wisconsin Watch (16 Feb 2026) notes that because there was no primary, \u201cno statewide contests appear on the Feb. 17 ballot,\u201d consistent with the absence of polling. Finding: information gap \u2013 empirical polling data is not yet available.\n\n5. Context \u2013 statewide election results & margins (official canvasses, Wisconsin Elections Commission; historical comps from 270toWin and Marquette Law School analysis)  \n\n   2020-2025 statewide contests and margin (winner listed first):  \n   \u2022 Nov 2020 \u2013 President: Joe Biden +0.63 pp (WEC canvass).  \n   \u2022 Apr 2023 \u2013 Supreme Court: Janet Protasiewicz (L) 55.4 % \u2013 Daniel Kelly 44.6 %  (WEC results; Ballotpedia)  margin +10.8 pp.  \n   \u2022 Nov 2022 \u2013 Governor: Tony Evers (D) +3.4 pp; U.S. Senate: Ron Johnson (R) +1.0 pp. (WEC)  \n   \u2022 Nov 2024 \u2013 President: Donald Trump +0.9 pp (270toWin state page; WEC canvass). Turnout 73 % of voting-age population, highest nationally. (Marquette Law School blog 27 Aug 2025)  \n   \u2022 Apr 2025 \u2013 Supreme Court: Susan Crawford (L) 55.0 % \u2013 Brad Schimel 45.0 %  margin +10.0 pp; turnout 50 % VAP (WEC; Marquette blog).  \n   \u2013 Historical note: Conservatives last won a Supreme Court election in 2019 (Brian Hagedorn 50.2 % \u2013 Lisa Neubauer 49.7 %). (Ballotpedia)\n\n   These results show a clear pattern: spring Supreme Court electorates have given liberal-backed candidates roughly 55 % of the vote for three straight cycles, while presidential-year November electorates remain razor-thin.\n\n6. Wisconsin Elections Commission (WEC) election-administration facts  \n   \u2022 Official, precinct-level results and turnout statistics for every statewide race are published at MyVote.wi.gov Election Results portal. (WEC information page reference in question prompt)  \n   \u2022 WEC\u2019s canvass reports confirm the vote totals cited above and will be the authoritative source for the 2026 contest after certification.\n\n7. Media coverage themes up to 16 Feb 2026  \n   a) Spending gap \u2013 Multiple outlets highlight Taylor\u2019s 10-to-1 money advantage and expectation that conservative mega-donors could still engage late (Center Square; Badger Project).  \n   b) Reduced stakes compared with 2023/2025 \u2013 because the ideological majority is not immediately at risk, fundraising and outside attention are running below record-setting pace (Badger Project 12 Feb 2026).  \n   c) Turnout uncertainty \u2013 Analysts (Marquette Law blog) note that liberals have built a structural edge in April elections as turnout has soared; whether that persists without a majority-control question remains to be seen.  \n   d) Issue salience \u2013 Abortion access, legislative redistricting disputes, and checks on a potential Republican legislature are focal points in candidate interviews (PBS Wisconsin \u201cHere & Now\u201d 30 Jan and 9 Jan 2026 clips).\n\n8. Key take-aways for forecasters  \n   \u2022 Fund-raising and recent April voting history currently favor Chris Taylor.  \n   \u2022 Conservatives have not topped 45 % in the last two spring races and have not won since 2019; Lazar must broaden the GOP-leaning electorate beyond its recent spring size.  \n   \u2022 No polling exists yet, so uncertainty around name recognition and campaign effects persists.  \n   \u2022 Late independent expenditures from conservative groups could narrow the resource gap, as happened in 2019.  \n   \u2022 Voter fatigue or lower perceived stakes (majority not on the line) could change the turnout model that favored liberals in 2023 and 2025; this represents a major analytic unknown.\n\n9. Remaining information gaps  \n   \u2022 Public polling of the 2026 matchup \u2013 none located.  \n   \u2022 Comprehensive endorsement lists \u2013 only one formal endorsement for Taylor surfaced; trade unions, law-enforcement associations, and newspapers have not yet published endorsements.  \n   \u2022 Updated campaign-finance disclosures for February \u2013 March spending, plus super-PAC/issue-ad expenditures, will be filed in March and early April.  \n   \u2022 Specific WEC numeric data for historic races (cited qualitatively here) could be tabulated for exact vote totals if needed.\n\nThe above addresses the requested background using WEC data sources and reputable news coverage available prior to 16 Feb 2026.</Agent_report>\n"
