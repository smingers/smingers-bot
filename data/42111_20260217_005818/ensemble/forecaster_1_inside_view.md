**Palestinian Cabinet announcement (Dec 2, 2025):** Official announcement setting April 25, 2026 date in accordance with Law Decree No. 23 of 2025. High credibility as primary source.

(b) Evidence analysis:

**Strong evidence favoring "Yes":**
- Multiple independent sources (WAFA, Sada News, Times of Israel, Al Jazeera, Arabic media) confirm voter registration closed on schedule Jan 25, 2026 (procedural milestone met)
- CEC published detailed legal timeline with candidate registration opening Feb 23, 2026 (6 days from now) - this represents critical commitment point
- No postponement announcement as of Feb 17, 2026 with 67 days remaining
- CEC actively preparing: AI assistant launch, technical readiness confirmed, voter registry finalized
- Cabinet decision formalized in Law Decree No. 23 of 2025 (legal framework established)

**Moderate evidence favoring "Yes":**
- Recent successful cycle (2021-22) proceeded without postponement, suggesting improved capacity
- Modified scope (Gaza limited to one municipality) shows pragmatic adaptation rather than full cancellation
- Multiple electoral events scheduled (local April 25, Fatah conference May 14, PNC November 1) suggests commitment to electoral calendar

**Strong evidence favoring "No":**
- Historical base rate: 60% postponement rate across 5 cycles since 2005
- Israeli escalation: Land registration measures approved Feb 15-17, 2026 represent major control expansion during election prep period
- Expert opinion: Prof. Kobi Michael (INSS) predicts PA will cancel if facing defeat
- Identified challenges: CEC acknowledged funding issues and occupation restrictions (Feb 12 WAFA)

**Moderate evidence favoring "No":**
- Regional instability: West Bank annexation measures, Gaza governance crisis
- Political legitimacy crisis: Expert criticism of constitutional draft timing, Fatah support halved (23% to 14% per Oct 2025 survey)
- Hamas banned from participation, reducing electoral legitimacy
- 67 days still allows postponement decision (historical precedent shows 1-4 week notice typical)

**Weak evidence:**
- UK election postponement reversal (not analogous context)
- Speculative connections between Israeli elections timing and Palestinian disruption

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Prediction timeframe:** 67 days from Feb 17, 2026 to April 25, 2026.

**Critical near-term milestone:** Candidate registration opens Feb 23, 2026 (6 days from now). If this proceeds, probability of elections increases significantly as candidates invest resources and political capital.

**If timeframe halved (33 days):** Probability would increase to ~75-80%. At 33 days out, candidate registration would be complete, campaign period would be imminent or underway. Historical postponements occurred 1-4 weeks before voting, so 33 days would be past typical decision point.

**If timeframe doubled (134 days):** Probability would decrease to ~45-50%. At 134 days out (early December 2025), we'd be before voter registration period. More time allows for political/security disruptions and decision reversals. Closer to historical base rate.

**Volatility assessment:** Current timeframe is moderately volatile. The Feb 23 candidate registration deadline is crucial inflection point. Israeli land registration measures (Feb 15-17) represent recent escalation that could trigger PA response.

(d) Justification:

**Starting point:** Outside view base rate of 62% (adjusted from 40% historical success rate based on current procedural progress).

**Factors warranting upward adjustment:**

1. **Procedural momentum (Strong evidence, +8%):** Voter registration completed on schedule Jan 25. This is most concrete indicator that differs from postponed cycles. In 2016, postponement occurred before registration phase. Current cycle has passed this hurdle.

2. **Imminent commitment point (Strong evidence, +5%):** Candidate registration opens in 6 days (Feb 23). Once candidates register and invest resources, political cost of cancellation increases dramatically. This is beyond typical postponement decision window.

3. **Pragmatic adaptation (Moderate evidence, +3%):** Gaza scope reduction to Deir al-Balah shows CEC adapting to constraints rather than canceling entirely. This problem-solving approach differs from previous cycles.

**Factors warranting downward adjustment:**

1. **Israeli escalation timing (Strong evidence, -10%):** Land registration measures approved Feb 15-17, 2026 represent major provocation during election preparation. Palestinian Authority condemned as "de facto annexation." This could trigger PA decision to postpone elections in protest or due to disrupted conditions. This is new information not reflected in outside view.

2. **Expert prediction of cancellation (Moderate evidence, -5%):** Prof. Kobi Michael (credible INSS researcher) explicitly predicts PA will cancel if facing defeat. Fatah support dropped from 23% to 14% (Oct 2025 survey). Hamas banned, reducing legitimacy. Political incentive for postponement exists.

3. **Persistent structural challenges (Moderate evidence, -3%):** CEC acknowledged funding gaps and occupation restrictions. These echo concerns from previous postponed cycles. While CEC claims contingency plans, no concrete solutions announced.

**Net adjustment:** +16% (procedural factors) -18% (political/security factors) = -2%

**Calibrated inside view:** 62% (outside view) - 2% = 60%

However, the Israeli land registration escalation on Feb 15-17 (just 2 days ago) is particularly significant and recent. This represents material change in security/political environment during the critical final preparation period. The timing is highly disruptive. This warrants additional -3% adjustment.

**Final calibrated prediction:** 57%

Probability calibration:

The outside view established 62% based on historical 40% success rate adjusted for current procedural progress. The inside view analysis reveals competing strong forces:

Positive: Procedural milestones met (voter registration complete), imminent candidate registration (Feb 23), pragmatic Gaza adaptation, no postponement announcement at 67 days.

Negative: Israeli land registration escalation (Feb 15-17) during preparation period, expert prediction of cancellation if Fatah faces defeat, persistent funding/access challenges, 60% historical postponement rate.

The Israeli escalation is particularly impactful as it occurred within the prediction window and represents exactly the type of disruption that triggered previous postponements. The PA's condemnation as "de facto annexation" creates political pressure to respond, potentially through election postponement.

The candidate registration deadline (Feb 23) is the critical inflection point. If registration proceeds, probability increases to ~70%. If postponement announced before Feb 23, probability drops to ~15%.

Current calibration: 57% represents slight downward adjustment from outside view due to recent Israeli escalation, while acknowledging strong procedural momentum. This translates to roughly 4:3 odds in favor of elections proceeding.

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Palestinian CEC report voting occurred on April 25, 2026 for local elections, or announce postponement/cancellation? (67 days from now)
   - Analysis aligns with resolution criteria focusing on CEC reporting and April 25 specific date.

2. **Outside view base rate:** 62% (from 40% historical success rate, adjusted for current procedural progress)
   - Final prediction 57% remains anchored to this base rate with modest -5% adjustment for recent escalation factors.

3. **Consistency check:** "57 out of 100 times, the CEC reports voting occurred on April 25, 2026."
   - This makes sense: slightly better than coin flip, reflecting strong procedural momentum balanced against historical postponement pattern and recent Israeli escalation.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence:**
   - Voter registration closed on schedule Jan 25, 2026 (factually verified, multiple sources)
   - Israeli land registration measures approved Feb 15-17, 2026, condemned by PA as annexation (verified, multiple international sources)
   - Candidate registration opens Feb 23, 2026 in 6 days (verified, official CEC timeline)
   - Historical 60% postponement rate across 5 cycles (verified, comprehensive agent report)
   - CEC acknowledged funding/access challenges but claims contingency plans (verified, Feb 12 WAFA)

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** PA announces postponement Feb 20-22 (just before candidate registration) citing Israeli land registration measures as creating "unsuitable conditions." This would make forecast look silly as I weighted procedural momentum heavily, but political response to Israeli escalation could override technical preparations. Would shift probability to ~15%.

6. **Status quo outcome:** Status quo is elections proceeding as scheduled (current official position). Given 67-day timeframe and completion of voter registration, modest bias toward status quo is appropriate. However, recent Israeli escalation (2 days ago) introduces volatility. Current 57% already incorporates slight status quo bias while accounting for disruption risk.

Probability: 57%
