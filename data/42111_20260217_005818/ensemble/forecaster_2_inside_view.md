**Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence (warrant large shifts):**
- **Israeli annexation measures (Feb 15-17, 2026):** Multiple independent sources confirm Israeli cabinet approved unprecedented land registration in West Bank, first since 1967. Palestinian Authority officially condemned as "de facto annexation." This represents a **major structural change** creating political crisis conditions. However, historical precedent shows Palestinian local elections proceeded in 2021-22 despite high violence. The question is whether this crosses a threshold requiring postponement.
  - Direction: Increases postponement risk
  - Magnitude: Moderate-to-strong (unprecedented action, but local elections have survived violence before)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Technical preparations proceeding:** CEC launched AI assistant (Feb 6), closed voter registration on schedule (Jan 25), published detailed timeline. Multiple procedural milestones met without delay signals.
  - Direction: Decreases postponement risk
  - Magnitude: Moderate

- **Gaza scope already limited:** CEC pre-emptively reduced Gaza to one municipality (Deir Al-Balah), removing a major historical postponement trigger (Hamas/PA friction over Gaza-wide voting).
  - Direction: Decreases postponement risk
  - Magnitude: Moderate

- **Electoral calendar density:** Abbas set PNC elections (Nov 1) and Fatah conference (May 14). Proceeding with April 25 local elections fits this sequence. Canceling would disrupt broader political timeline.
  - Direction: Decreases postponement risk
  - Magnitude: Weak-to-moderate

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Expert speculation (Prof. Kobi Michael):** Single expert opinion predicting cancellation if Fatah fears losing. This is **speculation**, not evidence of actual cancellation plans. PA has proceeded with elections despite poor polling before (2021-22).
  - Direction: Increases postponement risk
  - Magnitude: Weak (opinion, not fact)

**Timeframe Analysis:**

68 days until April 25, 2026. Historical precedent shows Palestinian elections have been canceled 30 days out (2010, 2016). We are still in the window where cancellation is procedurally feasible.

If timeframe were **halved (34 days):** Risk would decrease significantly. By mid-March, candidate lists would be finalized (March 31), campaign period starting (April 10). Cancellation becomes politically and logistically much harder.

If timeframe were **doubled (136 days, ~5 months out):** Risk would increase. More time for political crises to develop, Israeli actions to escalate, or internal PA/Fatah dynamics to shift.

**Justification:**

Starting from outside view base rate of **78%** (elections proceed).

**Factors increasing postponement risk:**
1. **Israeli annexation measures (Feb 15-17):** This is the most significant new development. The timing (just announced, 68 days before elections) and Palestinian Authority's strong condemnation create political crisis conditions. However, the key question is whether this necessitates postponing **local** elections specifically. Local councils handle municipal services (water, sewage, infrastructure), not sovereignty issues. The PA might view proceeding as an assertion of Palestinian administrative continuity despite Israeli actions.

2. **68 days remaining:** Still within historical cancellation window.

**Factors decreasing postponement risk:**
1. **Technical preparations on track:** Multiple procedural milestones met (AI assistant launch, voter registration closure, timeline publication). No administrative signals of postponement.

2. **Gaza friction pre-resolved:** Limiting Gaza to one municipality removes the Hamas/PA conflict that caused 2016 postponement.

3. **Broader electoral calendar:** Canceling April 25 would disrupt the sequence leading to Fatah conference (May 14) and PNC elections (Nov 1). The PA appears committed to a 2026 electoral cycle.

4. **Recent precedent (2021-22):** Local elections proceeded during high West Bank violence, suggesting resilience.

**Calibration:**

The Israeli annexation measures represent a genuine shock, but I assess they are **insufficient to override the strong procedural momentum** for several reasons:

- Local elections are administrative, not sovereignty-focused
- Technical preparations show no postponement signals
- Gaza friction (historic main cause) is pre-resolved
- Recent precedent (2021-22) shows elections can proceed during violence
- Broader 2026 electoral calendar creates institutional momentum

However, the annexation measures and 68-day window warrant a **moderate downward adjustment** from the 78% base rate.

**Adjustment:** -8 percentage points for annexation crisis and remaining time window.

**Probability Calibration:**

Starting point: 78% (outside view base rate)
Israeli annexation crisis: -5 pp
Time remaining (68 days, still in cancellation window): -3 pp
Technical momentum and Gaza pre-resolution: +0 pp (already factored into base rate)

**Final calibrated probability: 70%**

This reflects:
- Strong procedural momentum and recent precedent supporting elections proceeding
- Meaningful but not overwhelming risk from Israeli annexation measures
- Remaining time window for potential cancellation
- Recognition that local elections have survived political crises before

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase:** Will CEC report that Palestinian local elections voting occurred on April 25, 2026? (68 days from now)
   ✓ Analysis aligns with resolution criteria (CEC reporting actual voting on specific date)

2. **Base rate:** 78% (outside view from reference class of Palestinian elections since 2012)
   ✓ Final prediction (70%) is rooted to this base rate with justified adjustments

3. **Consistency:** "70 out of 100 times, CEC reports voting occurred on April 25, 2026."
   ✓ This makes sense: strong procedural momentum with meaningful but not overwhelming political risk

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence:**
   - Israeli cabinet approved West Bank land registration Feb 15-17 (Palestinian Authority condemned as annexation)
   - CEC completed voter registration closure Jan 25 on schedule; AI assistant launched Feb 6
   - Gaza voting pre-limited to Deir Al-Balah only, removing Hamas/PA friction trigger
   ✓ All factually verified from multiple reliable sources

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** 
   PA/Fatah leadership decides Israeli annexation measures require postponement as political statement, or security situation deteriorates sharply in next 30 days forcing logistical cancellation. This could drop probability to 40-50%.

6. **Status quo outcome:**
   Status quo = elections proceed as scheduled (all technical preparations on track). Current situation shows moderate volatility (annexation crisis) but strong institutional momentum. Slight nudge toward status quo is already reflected in 70% (not dropping below 65% despite crisis).

Probability: 70%
