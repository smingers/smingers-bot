Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis:**

**WAFA Agency (Feb 2, 2026):** Official Palestinian news agency reporting President Abbas's decree on PNC elections for November 2026. Factually confirms Cabinet's prior decision setting local elections for April 25, 2026. High-quality official source; no indication of postponement as of this date.

**ISPI (Feb 12, 2026):** European policy analysis institute discussing West Bank annexation measures and Gaza governance crisis. Contains expert opinions on political instability and coalition pressures. The unnamed expert notes national elections are "only months away" with uncertain coalition stability, suggesting a "narrowing window" for structural changes. This provides context on political pressures but doesn't directly address the April 25 date. Mixed relevance - high quality for political context, but speculative on election timing.

**Times of Israel (Jan 25, 2026):** Reports voter registration closure on January 25, 2026, with explicit confirmation that elections will occur April 25, 2026. CEC spokesman Farid Tumallah directly quoted confirming the date and candidate registration opening February 23. High-quality factual reporting with named official source.

**Al Jazeera article:** Not relevant - covers Albanian elections.

**Novara Media article:** Not relevant - covers UK politics.

**WAFA Agency (Feb 12, 2026):** Reports CEC Chairman meeting with Vice President Al-Sheikh. Details completed preparations including voter registry updates, nomination stage readiness, and training programs. Acknowledges challenges (funding, occupation restrictions) but describes contingency plans. Tone suggests ongoing preparations without postponement indication. High-quality official source; most recent relevant update.

**Agent Report:** Comprehensive historical timeline of Palestinian local elections 2005-2026. Documents four specific postponement instances: June 2010, 2011, October 2016, and 2020 (Gaza only). Confirms no postponement announced for 2026 cycle as of mid-February 2026. Lists three 2026 confirmations: CEC press release (Jan 2), Times of Israel (Jan 28), and Sada News. High-quality synthesis with specific citations.

(b) **Reference Class Analysis:**

**Reference Class 1: All Palestinian local election cycles (2005-2026)**
- 5 cycles attempted
- 4 cycles experienced postponements (2010, 2016, 2020, 2021-22 proceeded as scheduled)
- Postponement rate: ~60-80% depending on how we count
- Suitability: Moderate - captures institutional patterns but may overweight earlier instability

**Reference Class 2: Palestinian local elections since Hamas-Fatah reconciliation attempts (2016-2026)**
- 3 cycles: 2016-17 (postponed once), 2021-22 (held as scheduled), 2026 (TBD)
- Postponement rate: 33%
- Suitability: High - reflects more recent institutional capacity and political environment

**Reference Class 3: Palestinian elections post-2021 (most recent precedent)**
- 2021-22 cycle proceeded as announced without postponement
- Shows improved CEC capacity and follow-through
- Suitability: High - most recent institutional behavior, though sample size is small

**Reference Class 4: Current cycle stage-specific (post-announcement, pre-election)**
- Current position: 67 days before election, voter registration closed, candidate registration imminent
- Historical pattern: Once voter registration closes and candidate registration begins, postponements become less likely
- 2021-22 cycle had no postponement after these milestones
- Suitability: Very High - captures commitment level at similar timeline points

**Chosen Reference Class:** Combination of Reference Classes 2, 3, and 4 - focusing on post-2016 behavior with emphasis on recent institutional capacity and current advanced preparation stage.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction timeframe:** 67 days from today (Feb 17, 2026) to April 25, 2026.

**Historical patterns at similar timeframes:**
- 2021-22 cycle: Voter registration for Stage 1 occurred in October-November 2021 for December 11 election - no postponement in final 2 months
- 2016-17 cycle: Postponement announced October 4, 2016 for October 8 election (4 days before) - but this was due to court ruling, not administrative decision
- 2010 cycle: Postponement announced June 10 for July election - approximately 1 month notice
- Current cycle: Voter registration closed January 25; candidate registration opens February 23 (6 days from now)

**Key observation:** The current cycle is significantly more advanced than any previous postponement point. Voter registration has closed, candidate registration is imminent, and CEC has published detailed operational plans. The 2016 postponement was court-driven, not administrative. The 2010 postponement occurred earlier in the preparation cycle.

(d) **Justification:**

**Factors supporting elections proceeding as scheduled:**

1. **Advanced preparation stage:** Voter registry finalized, candidate registration opening in 6 days, operational plans published, field teams trained (per Feb 12 WAFA report)

2. **Recent institutional track record:** 2021-22 cycle proceeded without postponement, demonstrating improved CEC capacity

3. **Multiple official confirmations in 2026:** CEC press release (Jan 2), Times of Israel quoting CEC spokesman (Jan 25), WAFA reports (Feb 2, Feb 12) - no wavering on April 25 date

4. **Political momentum:** President Abbas has framed elections as part of reform process under international pressure; Vice President Al-Sheikh affirmed elections are "fundamental pillar" (Feb 12)

5. **Contingency planning:** CEC explicitly acknowledges challenges (funding, occupation restrictions) but has developed "alternative and contingency plans" rather than postponing

6. **Limited scope:** Elections are West Bank-focused (420 councils) plus only Deir al-Balah in Gaza - more manageable than full Gaza participation

**Factors suggesting possible postponement:**

1. **Historical precedent:** 60-80% of cycles experienced postponement (though declining trend)

2. **Funding challenges:** Explicitly mentioned by CEC as ongoing issue (Feb 12)

3. **Occupation restrictions:** Movement limitations affecting field teams and access to some areas

4. **Political instability:** ISPI expert notes coalition instability, "narrowing window" for Netanyahu, ongoing annexation measures creating volatile environment

5. **Gaza complications:** Even limited Deir al-Balah participation faces "logistically challenging" conditions per CEC spokesman

6. **Time remaining:** 67 days still allows window for postponement announcement if conditions deteriorate

**Integration:** The current cycle shows substantially stronger commitment signals than previous postponed cycles. The preparation stage is more advanced than any previous postponement point (except 2016 court ruling 4 days before). The 2021-22 precedent demonstrates institutional capacity to follow through. However, external pressures (funding, occupation restrictions, regional instability) remain significant. The key distinction is that previous postponements were announced earlier in preparation cycles or driven by external legal/political shocks, whereas current preparations suggest institutional commitment to proceed barring major disruption.

Outside view calibration:

**Base rate considerations:**
- Post-2016 cycles: 1 postponement out of 3 cycles = 33% postponement rate
- However, current cycle is at more advanced stage than 2016 postponement point
- 2021-22 cycle (most recent) proceeded as scheduled = 0% postponement rate at comparable stage

**Tethering to rough figures:**
- If using simple post-2016 base rate: 67% probability of proceeding
- Adjusting upward for advanced preparation stage and recent precedent: 75-80% range
- Adjusting for ongoing challenges (funding, occupation, instability): modest downward pressure

**Upset rate consideration:**
Palestinian elections have historically been subject to unexpected disruptions (court rulings, political splits, external pressures). However, the pattern shows postponements typically announced earlier in cycles. At 67 days out with voter registration closed and candidate registration imminent, the commitment level is high. Major disruptions (e.g., significant escalation in West Bank violence, court intervention, complete funding collapse) would be required to force postponement.

**Probability calibration:**
- Strong institutional signals and advanced preparation: +15-20 percentage points above base rate
- Ongoing external challenges and historical volatility: -5-10 percentage points
- Net adjustment: Starting from 67% base (post-2016), adding 10-15 points for current commitment level
- Final range: 77-82%

The probability should reflect that while Palestinian elections have been postponed frequently historically, the current cycle shows unusually strong commitment signals at an advanced preparation stage, similar to the successful 2021-22 cycle. However, significant external challenges remain that could force postponement.
