Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria (what “Yes” means)
This resolves “Yes” only if the Palestinian Central Elections Commission (CEC) reports that voting for local elections occurred on April 25, 2026. If voting does not occur that day due to postponement/suspension/cancellation, resolve “No”.

(a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality/date)
- CEC legal-periods announcement (elections.ps; referenced in prompt): Primary source. Sets binding administrative timelines culminating in Apr 25, 2026. High reliability; procedural not predictive.
- WAFA (Jan 19, 2026) “Gaza…highly challenging”: Official/near-official channel. Facts: Cabinet set Apr 25; CEC says Gaza-wide is extremely challenging; CEC plans West Bank + only Deir al-Balah in Gaza. High relevance; mixed signal (commitment + constraints).
- Sada News (date not shown in prompt; cites CEC): Secondary write-up of CEC timeline (registration, nominations Feb 23–Mar 1, campaigning, Apr 25 vote). Useful but derivative; moderate reliability, high relevance because it mirrors CEC.
- BERNAMA via WAFA (Feb 6, 2026) “AI assistant Nazih”: Reputable wire relaying WAFA. Fact: CEC launched voter-education tool explicitly for “upcoming elections on April 25, 2026.” Strong sign of active preparations; high relevance.
- Jerusalem Post (Feb 4, 2026): Mixed. Facts: reiterates Apr 25 local elections date; reports Abbas decree actions (incl. Hamas ban claim). Opinion: INSS researcher suggests PA may cancel if unfavorable. Medium relevance; watch for partisan framing; still useful as “risk narrative,” but weaker than CEC/WAFA for operations.
- AskNews / MarketScreener & other international coverage (Feb 15–17, 2026) on Israeli West Bank control/land registration: Reputable outlets. Facts: increased Israeli administrative/security moves in West Bank; Palestinians call de facto annexation. Indirect relevance: could disrupt movement/logistics or raise violence risk. Moderate relevance.
- AskNews / Al Jazeera (Feb 16, 2026) interim constitution draft: Reputable; largely political-legal context. Indirect relevance (institutional turbulence); weak-to-moderate.
- AskNews / Al Jazeera (Jan 26, 2026) voter registration closes; elections exclude Gaza except Deir al-Balah: Reputable; aligns with CEC stance. High relevance; operational milestone.
- AskNews / Ahram Gate (Jan 25, 2026) similar registration-close facts quoting CEC spokesperson: Medium-high reliability; high relevance.
- AskNews / Shorouk (Jan 19, 2026) similar: Medium-high; high relevance.
- ECFR (Dec 5, 2025) explainer: High-quality think tank. Mostly background; notes candidacy compliance filter; could affect competitiveness but not whether voting occurs. Moderate relevance.
- UK Guardian/BBC/Independent items included in packet: explicitly unrelated to Palestine; ignore for inference.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution criteria)
Strong evidence (pushes toward “Yes”):
- Multiple near-primary confirmations + concrete implementation: CEC timelines published; voter registration already completed; candidate nomination window imminent (Feb 23–Mar 1). This is the kind of “irreversible gearing” that usually precedes actually holding a vote.
- CEC public-facing investments (AI assistant, voter education) explicitly tied to Apr 25 election day. This is costly signaling and hard to square with an intention to postpone absent shock.
- Scope reduction is already baked in (West Bank + Deir al-Balah only), lowering operational burden and making “holding something on Apr 25” more feasible.

Moderate evidence (two-sided, but net risk):
- Security/administrative tightening in the West Bank (Israeli land-registration/expanded control measures). Mechanism: checkpoints/movement constraints, raids/violence spikes, or restrictions that impede ballot distribution/staff access. This is plausibly disruptive but not determinative yet.
- Political-manipulation risk narrative (e.g., Abbas/Hamas exclusion claims; expert skepticism). Mechanism: legitimacy disputes → boycott/violence → postponement decision. However, even boycotted elections can still be held; postponement requires an explicit decision or inability to operate.

Weak evidence (small adjustments):
- General “Palestinian elections often postponed” historical trope without a near-term trigger in current reporting.
- Broader constitutional/political initiatives (interim constitution draft) not directly linked to stopping local voting on Apr 25.

Net: the strongest evidence is operational and proximate (timelines + milestones + ongoing CEC prep), which directly maps to the resolution criterion (voting occurs on Apr 25). The main downside risks are exogenous shocks (security/legal) that could still arrive in a 67-day window.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time remaining: 67 days (Feb 17 → Apr 25, 2026).
- If the timeframe were halved (~33 days to go): I would increase probability because late-stage postponements are costlier and more conspicuous; absent a sudden shock, inertia favors “Yes.”
- If the timeframe were doubled (~134 days to go): I would lower probability because there is more time for security deterioration, political recalculation, or a legal/administrative intervention.

(d) Justification (inside view vs. outside view base rate)
Outside view base rate given: 78%.

What’s new/most decision-relevant in the current packet is not just “they say elections will happen,” but evidence that the process is already in motion on schedule (registration completed; nominations imminent; voter-education tooling launched) and that authorities have pre-emptively narrowed the hardest part (most of Gaza excluded except Deir al-Balah). These factors make the current case somewhat less analogous to cycles that were postponed earlier due to broad-scope infeasibility or pre-election political deadlock.

Offsetting that, the West Bank environment is plausibly worsening (Israeli administrative control measures), which could produce localized operational failures or a security escalation that forces a formal postponement. Still, the PA/CEC can often run voting in much of the West Bank under friction; the question is specifically whether voting occurs on that date at all (not whether it is comprehensive, competitive, or peaceful).

Overall, I nudge upward from 78% because (1) we have multiple, recent, operationally-grounded confirmations (not mere rhetoric), and (2) administrative “point-of-no-return” milestones are arriving on time—while (3) no specific, near-term trigger for postponement is evidenced yet.

Probability calibration
- Status quo (if nothing big changes): elections proceed on Apr 25 in the West Bank and Deir al-Balah as planned.
- Key “No” pathways: sharp West Bank security escalation; Israeli restrictions preventing logistics in enough areas to justify postponement; PA/CEC political decision to postpone if contest looks threatening; legal/judicial intervention; funding collapse severe enough to halt operations.
- Key “Yes” pathways: continued adherence to published calendar; nominations proceed; campaigning period begins; CEC keeps scope limited and manages logistics under restrictions.

Inside-view adjustment from 78%:
- +4 pp for continued concrete preparation signals (AI assistant launch; adherence to timeline; imminent nominations).
- -1 pp for rising West Bank administrative/security friction signals (annexation/control measures raising disruption risk).
= 81%

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: “Yes” if CEC reports local-election voting occurred on Apr 25, 2026; otherwise “No” if voting doesn’t occur that day due to postponement/suspension/cancellation.
2) Outside view base rate used: 78%.
3) Consistency check: 81 out of 100 times, the CEC reports voting occurred on Apr 25, 2026.
4) Top evidence (most significant):
   - CEC-published election calendar culminating Apr 25; process stages already underway.
   - Voter registration closed on schedule; candidate nominations open Feb 23.
   - Feb 6 CEC voter-education AI assistant explicitly framed around “upcoming Apr 25 elections.”
   - Elections operationally narrowed (West Bank + Deir al-Balah only), increasing feasibility.
   - Counterweight: increased West Bank control measures could disrupt logistics/security.
5) Blind spot (most likely to make forecast look silly): a sudden, major West Bank escalation or a last-minute political decision to postpone once nominations reveal unfavorable outcomes.
6) Status quo outcome: proceeding as scheduled; modest nudge toward “Yes” is appropriate given current inertia and short runway.

Probability: 81%
