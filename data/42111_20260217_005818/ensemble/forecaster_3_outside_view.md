Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each source says, how strong it is)
1. **WAFA (Feb 2, 2026)**  
   - **Factual content:** Notes the Cabinet had previously set **April 25, 2026** for local elections; focuses mainly on a separate PNC election decree.  
   - **Quality:** Medium. WAFA is a Palestinian official news agency; useful for confirming *official intent/signaling*, but not a hard “will happen” guarantee.  
   - **Use for outside view:** Supports that the scheduled date is “live” as of early Feb, but doesn’t meaningfully inform base rates of postponement.

2. **ISPI analysis (Feb 12, 2026)**  
   - **Factual content:** Describes worsening West Bank conditions, Israeli measures increasing control, displacement/violence, and Gaza governance dysfunction.  
   - **Quality:** Medium-high as analysis; it’s an expert think-tank piece, but much of it is **interpretation** rather than verifiable election logistics.  
   - **Use for outside view:** Relevant mainly as context that Palestinian administrative capacity and freedom of movement are often constrained—factors historically associated with delays.

3. **Times of Israel (Jan 25, 2026)**  
   - **Factual content:** Reports voter registration closure, election date confirmation, scope (West Bank councils + limited Gaza participation), candidate registration dates, and quotes a CEC spokesman.  
   - **Quality:** Medium-high; independent outlet, specific procedural details, attributable quote. Some framing may reflect Israeli political lens, but the operational details are plausibly sourced.  
   - **Use for outside view:** Confirms an election process is in motion, but outside view should treat this as “schedule exists,” not as evidence it will definitely hold.

4. **WAFA (Feb 12, 2026)**  
   - **Factual content:** Reports CEC readiness milestones (registry update, challenges phase, nomination preparations), cites funding and movement restrictions, mentions contingency plans, and reiterates Deir al-Balah participation in Gaza.  
   - **Quality:** Medium. Strong on what PA/CEC claim they are doing; weaker on independent verification.  
   - **Use for outside view:** Suggests typical constraints (funding, restrictions) that have historically sometimes preceded postponement—but also that preparations often proceed despite constraints.

5. **Agent report (timeline of postponements since 2005 + post–Jan 1, 2026 statements)**  
   - **Factual content:** Compiles a history: postponements in **2010/2011**, **2016** (court suspension and government postponement), **2020** (Gaza-specific), and elections that proceeded in **2012–2013**, **2017**, **2021–2022**. Lists CEC press releases about the 2026 calendar.  
   - **Quality:** Medium. It’s a secondary synthesis that may omit nuances; still, it provides the key ingredient needed for an outside view: a rough historical frequency of postponement after scheduling.  
   - **Use for outside view:** Primary basis for base-rate estimation, with appropriate skepticism about missing details (e.g., the 2011 decision not fully reproduced).

(Non-relevant sources: the Albania election article and Novara Media UK politics piece provide no election-process signal for Palestine.)

### (b) Reference class analysis (base-rate selection)
Plausible reference classes:

1. **“Palestinian local elections once a date is officially set by the Cabinet and CEC begins implementation (calendar published / registration underway)”**  
   - **Pros:** Closest match to the resolution criteria (whether voting occurs on a specific scheduled day). Captures the key failure mode: late postponement/cancellation.  
   - **Cons:** Small-N and heterogeneous political contexts across years.

2. **“Palestinian elections broadly (local + national) when announced”**  
   - **Pros:** More data points if national elections included.  
   - **Cons:** Much less comparable—national elections have far higher stakes and historically have been deferred for different reasons; would likely bias toward pessimism.

3. **“Elections in conflict-affected/occupied territories scheduled within ~2–3 months”**  
   - **Pros:** Larger-N conceptually; captures general disruption risk.  
   - **Cons:** Too broad; institutional specifics (CEC competence, PA incentives, Israeli restrictions) matter a lot.

**Most suitable reference class:** #1 (Palestinian local elections after formal scheduling and operational ramp-up).

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Forecast window:** From **today (Feb 17, 2026)** to **Apr 25, 2026** is **~67 days**.  
- **Historical pattern in similar horizons:** The 2016 case shows elections can be derailed relatively late (court suspension one month before). Conversely, 2021–2022 proceeded once underway.  
- **Implication:** With ~2 months left, there is meaningful “late shock” risk (security escalation, legal injunction, administrative access restrictions), but also increasing inertia/costs of postponement as preparations progress.

---

### (d) Justification (outside view logic)
Using the chosen reference class, the historical record suggests:
- There **have** been notable postponements after elections were planned (2010/11; 2016; Gaza-only 2020).  
- There have also been multiple cycles that **did proceed** once re-launched on a workable footing (2012–2013; 2017; 2021–2022).  

A simple base-rate approach: once a Palestinian local election date is officially set and the CEC is executing stages (registry updates, nomination windows, etc.), the event generally proceeds **more often than not**, but postponement is far from rare. The key outside-view takeaway is that the system has a **meaningful historical postponement rate**—driven by legal intervention, political splits (especially Gaza), and security/logistics.

Given the short lead time (67 days), I’d expect postponement probability to be **lower than** if we were 6–12 months out (because sunk costs and reputational stakes rise), but still substantial.

Outside view calibration:

- A reasonable tether from the historical record (as summarized) is that **postponement/suspension has occurred in a material minority of scheduled cycles**—on the order of **~20–35%** depending on how you count “scheduled rounds” vs “phases,” and whether you include Gaza-only postponements.  
- Given small-N and volatile context, I avoid extreme confidence: not 90%+ even if current signals are positive, because the domain has genuine upset risk (court rulings, security closures, funding/administrative constraints).  
- Conversely, I also avoid going below 50% because historically local elections **often do proceed** once formally re-initiated and operational steps begin.

Net: I center the outside view in the low–mid 70s.

Outside View Prediction:
**72.4%**
