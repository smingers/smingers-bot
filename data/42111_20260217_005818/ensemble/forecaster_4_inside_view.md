Analysis:
1. Source analysis (chronological order, 2026 dates; *opinions clearly flagged*)

A. WAFA (2 Feb 2026) – presidential decrees. Factual: cabinet date for local polls 25 Apr 26 still in force; no hint of delay. Official PA outlet; medium reliability; useful for government intent.

B. CEC press release via Sada News (8 Jan 26) – full legal timetable (registration 20-24 Jan, nomination 23 Feb-1 Mar, campaign 10-23 Apr, vote 25 Apr). Direct institutional source; high reliability for procedural status.

C. WAFA (19 Jan 26) – CEC admits Gaza-wide vote “extremely challenging”, so confines Gaza polling to Deir al-Balah only; 420 West-Bank councils proceed. Statement by CEC chair. High reliability; shows risk-mitigation step.

D. Al-Jazeera Arabic (26 Jan 26) – voter register closed; same 420 + Deir al-Balah plan. Confirms C., independent outlet; strong corroboration.

E. Bernama/WAFA (6 Feb 26) – CEC launches AI assistant for “upcoming 25 Apr elections”. Demonstrates ongoing mobilisation. Minor operational fact; medium reliability.

F. Jerusalem Post (4 Feb 26) – quotes INSS scholar doubting Abbas will allow elections if outcome uncertain. Clear opinion/analysis, single expert (Prof. Kobi Michael). Medium reliability, but speculative.

G. AskNews packet – multiple wires 15-17 Feb 26 on Israeli land-registry measures; factual escalation of tension in West Bank. Independent international outlets (Reuters derivative); high reliability for policy fact, relevance indirect (security climate).

H. Irrelevant UK-local-election stories (Guardian, Independent, etc.) – not pertinent to resolution; discarded.

2. Evidence analysis (⇡ weight raises probability, ⇣ lowers)
Strong ⇡:  
• CEC legally published timeline; stages already executed (registration finished) – structural, difficult to reverse late.  
• Multiple outlets confirm active preparations (AI tool, nomination window next week).

Moderate ⇡:  
• Limiting Gaza vote to single municipality removes biggest logistical/legal barrier seen in 2016 court suspension.  
• Historical pattern: since 2017, every time CEC got to voter-registration stage the vote occurred (2017 phase 2, 2021 phase 1 & 2) – three of three.

Moderate ⇣:  
• Palestinian High Court previously cancelled 2016 round one month before ballots over Gaza-representation complaints – legal vulnerability persists.  
• Escalating Israeli measures (land registration, security incidents) raise probability of widespread unrest, closures or PA declaring “force-majeure” postponement.

Weak ⇣:  
• Single expert view (K. Michael) that Abbas may abort if Fatah support weak – anecdotal, incentive plausible but evidence thin.

Net qualitative weighting: positives slightly outweigh negatives, but non-trivial downside risk remains.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Days until 25 Apr 26: ~67.  If decision window were halved (≈ 1 month left) my probability would rise ~+7 pts (fewer legal steps left to sabotage). If doubled (≈ 4 months) I would subtract ~5 pts (more time for shocks).

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (derived from six formally scheduled Palestinian local-election cycles since 2010): voting happened in 4, was postponed in 2 → 67-70%.  I anchored on 72 % earlier.

Inside-view upswing: procedural milestones completed; Gaza scope narrowed; historical inertia once nomination opens.  Inside-view downswing: precedent of late court stops; sharply deteriorating West-Bank security environment in February 2026; ban on Hamas lists may trigger legal or street backlash.

Balancing these shifts I trim the earlier 72 % to 70 %.

Probability calibration
Interpretation: In roughly 70 out of 100 worlds similar to this one, the CEC will report that voting actually took place on Saturday 25 April 2026; in 30 worlds it is postponed, suspended or cancelled.

Checklist:
1. Restatement – Question asks: “Did CEC confirm local-council voting occurred on 25 Apr 2026?”  
2. Base rate used: 72 %.  
3. Consistency line written above.  
4. Key evidence:  
  a) CEC timetable executed through registration.  
  b) Gaza restricted to Deir al-Balah, reducing 2016-type legal risk.  
  c) Israeli annexation moves increase unrest probability.  
  d) 2016 court precedent of late suspension.  
  e) Active public-awareness campaign (AI assistant) shows commitment.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden Palestinian High Court injunction, perhaps over Hamas ban, issued in late March forcing deferral. Would push ‘Yes’ probability below 20 %.  
6. Status-quo lean: current trajectory = elections proceed; weighting kept slightly toward that outcome.

Probability: 70%
