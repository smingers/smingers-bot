Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. WAFA, 2 Feb 2026 – Official Palestinian news agency. Purely factual: restates Cabinet decision that local elections are fixed for 25 Apr 2026. Fresh (15 days old).  
2. WAFA, 12 Feb 2026 – Reports CEC/vice-president meeting. Factual list of completed logistical preparations; mentions funding and movement obstacles as challenges but no hint of postponement. Fresh (5 days old).  
3. Times of Israel, 25 Jan 2026 – Independent Israeli outlet. Quotes CEC spokesman confirming the 25 Apr date and closing of voter-registration; gives detailed timetable. Factual; three weeks old.  
4. ISPI think-tank brief, 12 Feb 2026 – Analytical piece on West-Bank annexation. Contains expert opinions that Israeli measures and rising violence are destabilising. Not election-focused but relevant as a risk signal; credibility high, dated 5 days ago.  
5. Agent report (timeline) – Compiles CEC legal documents and reputable media. Good factual backbone for historical postponement record; cut-off mid-Feb 2026.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
i. All Palestinian municipal elections announced since 2004 (eight scheduled polling days).  
ii. Municipal elections announced since 2012 (after the big 2010/11 postponements – four polling days).  
iii. Elections in other conflict-affected polities (e.g., Afghanistan, Iraq) – looser fit.  
Class (ii) is the tightest match: same political system, same legal framework, same Israeli-occupation constraints, and same CEC procedures as the 2026 round.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Today → polling day: 68 days (a bit over nine weeks). Historically, last-minute cancellations have occurred inside this window:  
• 2010 vote scrapped 30 days out.  
• 2016 vote suspended 30 days out.  
Conversely, the four most recent rounds (2012, 2017, 2021, 2022) stayed on track. Hence, true risk of derailment still exists up to about one month before E-day.

(d) Justification  
Base-rate from class (ii): 4 scheduled → 4 held = 100 %.  That is obviously too optimistic because it rests on a small sample and ignores earlier failures.  Expanding to class (i): 5 held / 8 scheduled ≈ 63 %.  
Contextual adjustments (outside view only, so no attempt to track day-to-day manoeuvring):  
• Hamas/PA friction – chief historic cause of postponement – is muted; Gaza voting has been limited to a single municipality by prior agreement. Moves risk down.  
• Israeli annexation steps and uptick in West-Bank violence – fresh destabiliser, though municipal polling proceeded in 2021–22 amid high violence. Risk up slightly.  
• Technical readiness, funding, and donor engagement all look better than at equivalent points in 2016. Risk down modestly.  
• Still 68 days for a court, Cabinet, or presidential decree to intervene; precedent exists. Risk up modestly.  
Weighting the cleaner recent base rate (give it ⅔ weight) and the longer-run base (⅓ weight):  
0.67 × 1.00 + 0.33 × 0.63 ≈ 0.88.  
Apply a −10 percentage-point haircut for current security/annexation unpredictability and general “unknown unknowns” that have produced upsets c. 25 % of the time in the long series.

Outside view calibration:

Starting point: 88 % (blended base rate).  
Security & political shock discount: −10 pp → 78 %.  
No meaningful market or expert consensus figure is published yet to anchor against, so 78 % stands as the calibrated outside-view probability.  That corresponds to odds of roughly 3.5 : 1 in favour, leaving a 22 % chance of a postponement or cancellation shock in the next nine weeks.

Outside View Prediction:
78 % likelihood that Palestinian local elections will be held on 25 April 2026.
