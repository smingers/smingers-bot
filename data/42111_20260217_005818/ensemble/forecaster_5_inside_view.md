Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. WAFA (2 Feb 2026, Arabic) – State-run Palestinian agency quoting the presidential decrees that fix 25 Apr 2026 for local elections and 14 May for the Fatah conference. Purely factual, high proximity to decision-makers; bias is pro-PA but dating is recent.  
2. Sada News (22 Jan 2026) – Reprints the CEC’s legal timetable (registration, nomination, campaigning, polling on 25 Apr). Cites the original CEC press release 5150; good factual value.  
3. WAFA (19 Jan 2026) – CEC statement that elections in Gaza are feasible only in Deir al-Balah; confirms West Bank + one Gaza locality will still vote on 25 Apr. Source is the CEC chair.  
4. BERNAMA via WAFA (6 Feb 2026) – Reports CEC launch of “Nazih” AI bot answering questions “about the upcoming 25 Apr 2026 elections”. Indicates continued operational planning.  
5. Jerusalem Post (4 Feb 2026) – Article on PNC elections; mentions local elections date and quotes INSS analyst predicting Abbas might cancel elections “if Hamas can run”. Opinion from a named expert, but about higher-stakes national polls; lower weight for municipal elections.  
6. AskNews feed (17 Feb 2026 and 15-16 Feb bundle) – Several international wires on Israeli land-registration/annexation moves that heighten West Bank tension. Widely carried by Reuters/AFP equivalents; high factual reliability; relevance is indirect (security risk).  
Overall: four primary-source-level items from the CEC/PA (strong), one outside expert opinion (moderate), and several security-context wires (moderate).

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (pro-Yes)  
• CEC has completed statutory milestones (registration closed 24 Jan; objections phase 7-9 Feb) and published the remaining calendar up to 25 Apr – structural, hard to unwind quickly.  
• Cabinet decree of 2 Dec 2025 legally obliges elections within six months of the new Local Councils Law – cancelling would require another formal act.  
Strong evidence (pro-No) – none.  
Moderate evidence (pro-No)  
• Escalating Israeli measures in Feb 2026 (land registry, expansion of Area C authority) raise likelihood of security disruptions and PA backlash.  
• Historical pattern: two of eight previous local-election rounds were postponed 30–31 days before polling, showing late reversals are possible.  
Moderate evidence (pro-Yes)  
• Public-facing investments (AI assistant, media campaigns) signal sunk administrative costs and reputational stakes for the PA/CEC.  
Weak evidence  
• Jerusalem Post expert speculation that the PA “will likely cancel elections” – targeted at PNC, only loosely applicable here.

Net weighting: Pro-Yes strong + moderate factors outweigh pro-No moderate factors.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until the target: 67 (≈2.2 months).  In past postponements (2010, 2016) the cancellation decision came 30-31 days pre-poll.  If we were 30 days out with no postponement rumours, I would increase probability by ~+8 pp; if we were 120 days out, I would subtract ~5 pp because more time exists for things to go wrong.

(d) Justification / inside-view update  
Outside-view base rate (held on first announced date) = 75 %.  
Adjustments:  
+4 pp  Strong administrative progress (timetable met, AI outreach) – costly signals.  
+2 pp  Resolution criterion is lenient: any voting on 25 Apr counts; Gaza-wide cancellation would still leave West Bank ballots.  
–3 pp  Heightened West Bank tension and possible Israeli movement restrictions.  
Total shift = +3 pp ⇒ 78 %.  Error band ±10 pp remains due to small historical sample and volatile security context.

Probability calibration
78 % means that in roughly 78 out of 100 comparable situations, the CEC would report that voting occurred on 25 Apr 2026.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will the CEC confirm that any local-council voting took place on 25 Apr 2026?”  
2. Base-rate used: 75 % historical on-time local elections.  
3. Consistency line: “78 of 100 times, polling happens on the scheduled day.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   – CEC statutory timeline completed on schedule.  
   – Cabinet decree legally fixing date six months after new law.  
   – Public rollout of AI assistant and voter-education drive.  
   – Only Deir al-Balah in Gaza needed; West Bank dominates logistics.  
   – Israeli annexation steps raise, but do not guarantee, security disruption.  
5. Blind-spot: A dramatic spike of violence or an Israeli military closure in April that the PA cites to postpone 48 h beforehand. Would flip outcome to No.  
6. Status-quo: Momentum and sunk costs favour holding the vote; slight tilt toward Yes was therefore applied.

Probability: 78%
