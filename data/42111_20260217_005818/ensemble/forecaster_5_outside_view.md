Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  

1. WAFA, 2 Feb 2026 – Palestinian state-run news agency. Purely factual report that the cabinet-set date for local elections remains 25 Apr 2026. Bias is pro-PA but the item is recent (15 days old) and quotes the official decree.  
2. Times of Israel, 25 Jan 2026 – Israeli mainstream outlet that routinely covers Palestinian affairs. Gives operational details (voter-registration closed, candidate period opens 23 Feb, poll date 25 Apr) and quotes the CEC spokesman. Straight news; minimal opinion content.  
3. WAFA, 12 Feb 2026 – Reports the Vice President’s visit to the CEC. Describes completed preparatory stages and the remaining timetable. Flags funding and movement constraints but no hint of postponement. Factual, six days old.  
4. ISPI analysis brief, 12 Feb 2026 – Italian think-tank piece on annexation measures and West Bank violence. Contains both facts (cabinet decisions of 8 Feb) and expert commentary. Relevance: highlights a deteriorating security context that could endanger polling. Quality: credible but indirectly related.  
5. Irrelevant pieces (Albania election, UK Green Party) – discarded.  
6. Agent report – Synthetic chronology built from CEC primary documents and reputable media. Compiles every instance of PA/CEC postponement since 2004 and lists 2026 legal calendar (CEC press release 5150, 2 Jan 2026). The underlying documents are primary; the synthesis is transparent about any gaps.

(b) Reference class analysis  

Candidate classes considered:  
1. All Palestinian local-election cycles since they began in 2004.  
2. All Palestinian elections of any type (local, legislative, presidential) since Oslo.  
3. Municipal elections in other conflict-affected polities (e.g., Lebanon, Iraq local councils).  

Class 1 is preferred: it is narrowly matched to what we are forecasting (same legal framework, same actors, comparable administrative burden) and yields eight clearly coded “scheduled-date events” over 20 years. Class 2 mixes very different stakes (national power) and Class 3 introduces heterogeneous institutions.

Within Class 1 we code whether the election occurred on the first date officially announced by the Council of Ministers/CEC:

• 2004-05 four-phase cycle – all four phases held on first announced dates → 4 successes  
• 2010 cycle – July 2010 date postponed → 1 failure  
• 2011 reschedule – also postponed → 1 failure  
• 2016 cycle – 8 Oct 2016 date postponed by court/government → 1 failure  
• 2021 stage 1 (11 Dec 2021) – held → 1 success  
• 2022 stage 2 (26 Mar 2022) – held → 1 success  

Total: 8 scheduled-date observations; 6 successes, 2 failures ⇒ empirical base rate 75 % that a first-announced polling day is met.

(c) Timeframe analysis  

There are 67 days (≈2.2 months) until the 25 Apr 2026 target.  
Looking at the two historical failures:  
• 2010 postponement was decided 30 days before election day.  
• 2016 postponement occurred 31 days before election day (court ruling 8 Sep for 8 Oct).  

Both were within a two-month window identical to the present. Hence the “danger zone” for a late postponement starts now; nevertheless, four other cycles proceeded to vote without incident over comparable lead times.

(d) Justification (outside view)  

1. Base rate: 75 % from the selected reference class.  
2. Conditioning on the current date: all authoritative statements in the last six weeks (CEC PR 5150, WAFA 2 Feb & 12 Feb, Times of Israel 25 Jan) confirm preparations are on schedule; no postponement rumour has appeared. Historically, when postponements happened, tangible legal or court action was already visible one month out. We see none yet — a slight positive update.  
3. Counter-pressures: ISPI notes escalating West Bank violence and new Israeli administrative moves that could complicate logistics. Analogous security spikes preceded neither the 2016 nor 2010 postponements (those were political/legal). That uncertainty warrants some discount from the raw 75 %.  
4. Expert/market cues: no public betting market, but the CEC’s completion of voter-list exhibition, training, and nomination-system build-out is a costly signal of intent.

Balancing points 2 (upward) and 3 (downward) suggests only a mild net adjustment to the 75 % base rate.

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor: 75 % (6/8 historical adherence).  
• Security/annexation risk discount: –7 % (one in four chance that a sharp deterioration makes balloting impossible).  
• Positive administrative signal bump: +4 % (strong on-time preparatory milestones).  
• Net outside-view probability: 75 % – 7 % + 4 % ≈ 72 %.  

Given the tiny sample, an error band of ±10 pp is reasonable, but the point estimate should not be rounded to the nearest 5 %.

Outside View Prediction:
72 % chance that Palestinian local elections are held on 25 April 2026.
