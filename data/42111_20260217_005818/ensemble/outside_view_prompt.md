**Authors:** Caterina Roggero and Sara Isabella Leykin

## Key Facts and Developments:

### West Bank Annexation Measures (February 8, 2026):
- Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich and Defence Minister Israel Katz announced security cabinet decisions to increase Israeli control over the West Bank
- Measures include:
  - Repeal of a decade-long ban on direct sale of West Bank land to non-Muslims
  - Declassification of local land registry records
  - Facilitation of Israeli Jewish land purchases in Areas A, B, and C (Areas A and B are theoretically under Palestinian Authority civilian control per Oslo Accords)
  - Transfer of building permit authority for Jewish settlements in Hebron/Al Khalil (including Tomb of the Patriarchs) from Palestinian Authority to Israel

### Violence and Displacement:
- Violence against Palestinians in the West Bank has intensified in recent months
- **January 2026:** Approximately 700 Palestinians displaced from their homes (second-highest monthly total since October 2023 peak of 1,032)

### Gaza Governance Crisis:
- Israel continues preventing National Committee for the Administration of Gaza (NCAG) members from entering Gaza
- One month after NCAG's inauguration, none of its 15 members have been allowed into Gaza
- US has not informed NCAG where their offices/residences would be or which staff they can have
- Hamas presence on the ground complicates NCAG's operational effectiveness

### Netanyahu-Trump Meeting (February 11, 2026):
- Netanyahu visited Washington for talks focused on Israel's security concerns regarding Iran
- Netanyahu confirmed participation in the "Board of Peace"
- Netanyahu outlined principles for Iran negotiations including: complete dismantling of heavy weaponry, Tehran's renunciation of enriched uranium stockpiles, end to support for regional proxies
- No definitive breakthrough reached; Trump indicated US negotiations with Iran would proceed

## Expert Analysis:

**On West Bank Measures (unnamed ISPI expert):**
- Decisions mark continuation of longer trajectory that has accelerated in recent years
- Measures use administrative/civilian tools to normalize Israeli civilian authority in West Bank
- Timing appears strategic: days before Netanyahu-Trump meeting, with Trump having signaled opposition to de facto annexation
- National elections "only months away" with coalition stability uncertain, creating "narrowing window" for structural changes

**On US-Israel Relations (Noa Shusterman Dvir, Senior Researcher, MIND Israel):**
- Since Trump's inauguration, US-Israel relations "extremely strong" (seven meetings within one year, many phone calls)
- Israeli public credits Trump for hostage release from Hamas, "overshadowing and excluding Netanyahu's role"
- Netanyahu limited in capacity to object to Trump publicly (unlike with Biden/Obama)
- Netanyahu needs to uphold ceasefire with Hamas to maintain Trump's support on Iran
- Netanyahu faces coalition pressure objecting to Trump's 20-Point Plan conditions

**On Gaza Situation (Muhammad Shehada, Gazan writer and political analyst, +972 Magazine):**
- NCAG described as "government in name only"
- Israel "engineering the collapse of Phase Two"
- Abu Shabab militia given control over checkpoints near Rafah crossing, harassing returning Palestinians
- Israeli army approved plans to occupy all of Gaza
- Ceasefire "violated by Israel more than 1,500 times," described as "mere waiting room for renewed assault"
- US "applies no pressure" while Israel advances "New Rafah" prison camp with biometric surveillance

**On NCAG Challenges (unnamed expert):**
- Three weeks after establishment, Israel hasn't allowed NCAG into Gaza
- Palestinian Authority views NCAG as potential competitor despite formal welcome
- Three key actors have "little interest in the committee's success": Israel, PA, and Hamas elements in Gaza
- Hamas leadership in Doha supports NCAG, but Hamas authorities within Gaza consolidate control, creating obstacles
- Gaza population has "welcomed the establishment of the committee" as possible turning point

# Summary of Article

**Disclaimer:** This article is about UK politics and the Green Party/Your Party, and does not contain any information relevant to the forecasting question about Palestinian local elections scheduled for April 25, 2026.

## Article Content:
The article is an opinion piece by Candi Williams and Anahita Zardoshti published in Novara Media. It argues that while the UK Green Party provides valuable opposition to rightward political shifts in Britain, it is insufficient to address major challenges like fascism, climate breakdown, and what the authors describe as government-enabled genocide.

**Key Arguments:**
- The authors advocate for a mass socialist party rather than the Green Party's reform-focused approach
- They criticize the Greens for lacking grassroots organization despite tripling membership to 190,000 over 6 months
- The authors promote "Your Party" as an alternative, describing it as having over 60,000 members and approximately 200 proto-branches across the UK
- They detail their own organizing work in Bristol (growing from 40 to 400 people since September) and Islington, including political education, community organizing, Palestine protests, and picket line support
- The article discusses internal party elections for a Central Executive Committee (CEC), with two competing slates: "The Many" (backed by Jeremy Corbyn) and "The Grassroots Left" (backed by Zarah Sultana, on which both authors are standing)
- Voting deadline mentioned: February 5 (Thursday)

**Relevance to forecasting question:** None. This article contains no information about Palestinian elections or the Palestinian Central Elections Commission.

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide a timeline of Palestinian local elections since 2005, noting every time the CEC or Palestinian government postponed or cancelled them, and retrieve any statements issued after 1 Jan 2026 that confirm or question the 25 Apr 2026 voting date.
Palestinian Local-Council (municipal) elections have been an irregular process since they were first introduced in 2004-05.  Below is a consolidated chronology from 2005 through the present, highlighting every occasion on which the Central Elections Commission (CEC) or the Palestinian government (Council of Ministers / Cabinet) formally postponed, suspended, or cancelled a scheduled local-election round.  All dates are Gregorian.

1. First local-election cycle, 2004-2005  
   • Phase 1 23 Dec 2004 – held.  
   • Phase 2 27 Jan 2005 – held.  
   • Phase 3 05 May 2005 – held.  
   • Phase 4 15 Dec 2005 – held.  
   (No postponements in this first cycle; supervision was by the Higher Committee for Local Elections, not yet the CEC.) (Elections.ps “Previous Election Events”).

2. Second cycle, 2010-2013  
   • Original call Feb 2010 for elections in July 2010.  
   • 10 Jun 2010 Cabinet Decision No. 01/13/52 A/C.M/P.A  formally “Postponed the Local Elections Date” – first postponement. (Elections.ps “Presidential decrees and Cabinet decisions”).  
   • Further postponement in 2011 – the government again deferred the vote that had been rescheduled for 2011 (Elections.ps “Previous Election Events” notes the process “was otherwise postponed over two successive years”).  
   • 10 Jul 2012 Cabinet set a new date; first round finally held 20 Oct 2012, West Bank only.  
   • Complementary rounds 22 Dec 2012 and 01 Jun 2013 – held to cover remaining municipalities.  No further delays once the process started.

3. Third cycle, 2016-2017  
   • 21 Jun 2016 Cabinet called elections for 08 Oct 2016 in West Bank & Gaza.  
   • 08 Sep 2016 PA High Court suspended the vote; on 03 Oct 2016 it ruled it could proceed only in the West Bank.  
   • 04 Oct 2016 Government accepted the ruling and “decided to postpone the vote by four months, until the beginning of 2017,” citing CEC advice (Haaretz, 04 Oct 2016).  
   • 31 Jan 2017 Cabinet Decision fixed a new date, 13 May 2017 – elections held that day in 326 of 391 West Bank localities (Elections.ps “Previous Election Events”).  
   • 29 Jul 2017 Complementary elections held in 32 additional localities – completed without postponement.

4. Gaza-specific postponement, 2020  
   • 2020 Cabinet Decision titled “Postponement of Local Elections in the Southern Governorates” formally deferred any municipal vote in Gaza that year (Elections.ps “Presidential decrees and Cabinet decisions”).  No West Bank election was scheduled in 2020, so only Gaza was affected.

5. Fourth cycle, 2021-2022  
   • 06 Sep 2021 Cabinet called a two-stage local election.  
   • Stage 1 11 Dec 2021 – ballots cast in 154 small West Bank localities.  
   • Stage 2 26 Mar 2022 – ballots cast in 50 larger municipalities.  
   • Gaza was excluded de facto; there were no CEC or governmental postponements once dates were announced. (Elections.ps “Previous Election Events”).

6. Fifth cycle (scheduled), 2026  
   • 18 Dec 2025 Council of Ministers Decision (CEC press release 5148) officially “announced the date for commencing local elections” on 25 Apr 2026 and instructed the CEC to begin preparations.  
   • 02 Jan 2026 CEC press release 5150 published the full legal calendar for all stages (registration, nomination, campaigning, polling-day 25 Apr 2026, and result publication) (“The CEC Announces the Legal Periods Associated with the Different Stages of the 2026 Local Elections”, Elections.ps, PR 5150).  
   • 28 Jan 2026 President Mahmoud Abbas issued a decree amending the Local-Elections Law to require all candidates to sign a pledge to the PLO’s program; the Central Elections Commission circulated the decree the same day.  Media coverage (Times of Israel, 28 Jan 2026) stated the election is “slated for April 25” and did not report any change of date.  
   • Sada News, early 2026, likewise notes that “the Cabinet had previously issued a decision to set the date for local authority elections in Palestine on 25/4/2026,” with no indication of postponement.  

Postponement / cancellation record summary (2005-2026):
• 10 Jun 2010 – Government postpones 2010 local elections (all areas).  
• 2011 (exact decision date not specified) – Second postponement of the same cycle.  
• 08 Sep 2016 – PA High Court freezes October 2016 vote; 04 Oct 2016 Cabinet moves it to early 2017 (all areas).  
• 2020 – Cabinet postpones elections in Gaza (“Southern Governorates”) only.  
There have been no CEC/government postponements announced for the 2026 round as of mid-February 2026.

Statements after 1 January 2026 that confirm or question the 25 Apr 2026 voting date:

1. CEC press release 5150, 02 Jan 2026 – confirms the statutory schedule culminating in “polling day: Saturday 25 April 2026” (Elections.ps PR 5150).  
2. Times of Israel, 28 Jan 2026 – reports Abbas’s new candidate-eligibility decree and explicitly refers to “municipal elections slated for April 25,” indicating the date stands (TimesofIsrael, 28 Jan 2026).  
3. Sada News Agency report (2026) – states that “the Cabinet had previously issued a decision to set the date for local authority elections in Palestine on 25/4/2026,” again reflecting that the timetable is intact (Sada News).  

No press item retrieved after 1 Jan 2026 indicates any intention by the CEC, the Council of Ministers, or the President to delay or cancel the 25 Apr 2026 poll.  Likewise, no CEC notice of suspension/postponement appears on the Commission’s official “Presidential Decrees and Cabinet Decisions” page as of the latest available entry (Elections.ps, visited February 2026).

Information gaps
• The exact date and text of the 2011 Cabinet decision that effected the second postponement of the 2010/11 cycle are referenced but not reproduced in the public “Previous Election Events” narrative; obtaining the formal resolution number would complete the timeline.  
• The CEC website may publish additional press releases or operational updates closer to polling day; continuous monitoring is required to detect any late postponement.  
• No source yet details whether the 2020 Gaza-only postponement was ever rescinded or replaced by an alternative voting arrangement; clarification would round out the postponement log for that year.  

At present, however, every authoritative statement issued in 2026 affirms that Palestinian local elections are still scheduled for 25 April 2026, and the historical record of postponements is confined to the years 2010, 2011, 2016, and 2020.</Agent_report>

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
