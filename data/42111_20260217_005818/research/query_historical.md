Analysis:
The key to judging whether voting will happen on 25 Apr 2026 is the recent track-record of Palestinian local elections: how often have they been postponed, under what circumstances, and what the Central Elections Commission (CEC) has said so far about the 2026 round. Therefore I want:
• CEC press releases that set or confirm the 25 Apr 2026 date and any later notices hinting at delay.  
• News coverage since late-2025 discussing logistical or political obstacles (e.g., security in Gaza/West Bank, financial crises, court injunctions) that previously caused postponements.  
• Historical examples (2016, 2017, 2021 elections) to estimate the base-rate of postponement.
