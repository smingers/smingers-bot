The move, aimed at formalizing civil and property rights, is being condemned by Palestinian officials and the Israeli settlement watchdog group Peace Now as a violation of international law. Jad Isaac, Director General of the Applied Research Institute of Jerusalem, stated the process could enable Israel to control over 80% of West Bank territory. Hagit Ofran of Peace Now warned that the registration would allow the state to automatically claim ownership of land in Area C\u2014where Palestinians would be unable to prove ownership\u2014effectively facilitating de facto annexation. The West Bank is central to Palestinian aspirations for an independent state, with much of it under Israeli military control and limited Palestinian self-rule in certain areas. Israeli Foreign Ministry spokesperson Oren Marmorstein defended the move as a measure to bring order to land registration and resolve private land disputes. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, facing an upcoming election, views Palestinian statehood as a security threat. His coalition, which includes members supportive of annexing the West Bank due to its biblical and historical significance, has pushed for the policy. The Palestinian presidency called the measure 'a de facto annexation of occupied Palestinian territory.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 12:06 AM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/israel-approves-measures-to-tighten-control-over-west-bank-ce7e5dd8db80f42d)\n\n**UK government drops plans to delay May council votes, adding to pressure over U-turns**\nOn February 16, 2026, the UK government, led by Prime Minister Keir Starmer, abandoned plans to delay 30 local council elections originally scheduled for May 2026, following legal advice that the move risked a court challenge. The decision reversed a prior policy allowing some councils to postpone elections ahead of local government reorganisation, which political opponents, including Reform UK, accused of being a strategy to minimise electoral losses. The government stated that all elections would now proceed as scheduled, affecting approximately 4.5 million voters. This U-turn adds to growing pressure on Starmer, who has faced multiple reversals on major policy initiatives since Labour's landslide victory in July 2024. Recent court rulings have declared the government's ban on a pro-Palestinian group unlawful, and Starmer's leadership was challenged over his appointment of Peter Mandelson as US ambassador, due to Mandelson\u2019s ties to Jeffrey Epstein. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage hailed the court victory on X, calling it a 'victory for democracy,' while Conservative opposition leader Kemi Badenoch criticized the government as 'predictable chaos' and 'useless.' The May elections are now seen as a potential flashpoint for internal Labour dissent.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 08:12 PM\nSource:[The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/europe/uk-government-drops-plans-to-delay-may-council-votes-adding-to-pressure-over-u-turns)\n\n**Labour's local election U-turn will not undo yet another own goal**\nThe UK government's decision to proceed with local elections in approximately 30 authorities in May 2026\u2014after initially postponing them\u2014was deemed the correct move despite being driven by a looming High Court ruling that the original delay was unlawful. Around 4 million voters will now have the chance to participate in democratic processes, a right protected under Article 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998, which guarantees free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot. The postponement had sparked widespread resentment, particularly in areas where council mergers and the abolition of historic county boundaries were underway, and voters were denied a say in these changes. The reversal reflects poor political judgment, especially given that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer is a former director of public prosecutions and a human rights lawyer. This U-turn follows another legal defeat, when a ban on Palestine Action was struck down as unlawful. Critics argue the delay was politically motivated, especially amid Labour\u2019s low popularity, and that the government failed to recognize the ethical, political, and legal gravity of disenfranchising voters. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage claimed victory on X, stating, 'We took this Labour government to court and won. In collusion with the Tories, Keir Starmer tried to stop 4.5 million people voting on May 7th. Only Reform UK fights for democracy.' However, Reform\u2019s local governance record shows little administrative efficiency\u2014raising council tax and failing the 'Doge UK' experiment\u2014suggesting electoral success does not equate to effective governance. Labour faces a likely significant defeat on 7 May, with the government appearing unable to manage even basic political decisions, leaving it vulnerable to further humiliation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 07:41 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/labour-local-election-u-turn-183505433.html)\n\n**Labour's local election U-turn will not undo yet another own-goal**\nThe UK government reversed its decision to postpone local elections in approximately 30 authorities, allowing up to 4 million people to vote in May 2026, following a legal challenge that deemed the original postponement unlawful. The Independent criticizes the reversal as a result of poor judgment rather than malice, noting that Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, a former director of public prosecutions and human rights lawyer, should have recognized the violation of Article 3 of the Human Rights Act 1998, which guarantees free elections at reasonable intervals by secret ballot. The original move to delay elections\u2014justified by administrative convenience and cost-saving\u2014was widely perceived as politically motivated, especially given Labour\u2019s low popularity and the context of a recent High Court ruling that struck down Labour\u2019s ban on Palestine Action as 'unlawful'. The article argues that the postponement caused public resentment, particularly in areas where local government reorganization was underway, and that the government failed basic political and ethical standards. Reform UK, which challenged the decision in court, claimed a moral victory, with Nigel Farage stating on X that they had protected democracy. However, the article notes that Reform UK\u2019s local governance record has been ineffective, with tax increases and failed initiatives like 'Doge UK'. While the Greens, Liberal Democrats, SNP, and Plaid Cymru may benefit from the weakened traditional parties, the Labour Party faces a likely significant electoral backlash, with the article suggesting that the government\u2019s inability to even execute its own plan reflects deeper dysfunction. The reversal is portrayed as a humiliating own-goal for Labour, with the government appearing unable to manage even basic democratic processes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:33 PM\nSource:[The Independent](https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/editorials/labour-local-election-uk-politics-u-turn-keir-starmer-b2921373.html)\n\n**Fear in the West Bank Over Israeli Expansion Plans**\nThe Israeli security cabinet approved major changes to the long-standing division of control in the occupied West Bank on February 16, 2026, undermining the framework established by the 1993 U.S.-brokered Oslo Accords. These changes extend Israeli control beyond military zones into areas previously under Palestinian administrative authority, including municipal services in Palestinian-controlled regions. The new measures grant Israel expanded powers to claim 'heritage sites'\u2014such as water, environmental, and archaeological resources\u2014under the pretext of protection. A notable example is the tomb of Rachel, currently managed by Bethlehem municipality, which will be transferred to a new Israeli authority. A senior Palestinian official stated these changes have effectively ended any possibility of meaningful dialogue between the two sides. Hebron\u2019s acting mayor, Asma al-Sharbatli, told BBC that the new legal framework will exclude Palestinian officials from planning and development decisions, even in areas officially under Palestinian control. Hebron, one of the most volatile cities in the West Bank, hosts hundreds of Israeli settlers protected by Israeli military forces. Over 700,000 Israelis live in the West Bank and East Jerusalem, territories Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East War. Palestinians seek these areas for a future independent state alongside Gaza. The international community largely considers Israeli settlements in these areas illegal under international law. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, running for re-election later in 2026, has consistently argued that establishing a Palestinian state would threaten Israel\u2019s security.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 03:31 PM\nSource:[vaticannews.va](https://www.vaticannews.va/hi/world/news/2026-02/israel-palestine-political-violence-politics.html)\n\n**Palestinian Interim Constitution Draft: What's New and Why Now?**\nOn February 9, 2026, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas announced the release of the draft 'Interim Constitution of the State of Palestine' for public and institutional review over a 60-day period. The draft, developed by a committee formed on August 18, 2025, under the leadership of Dr. Muhammad al-Hajj Qasim, comprises a preamble, 13 chapters, and 162 articles. It emphasizes adherence to the 1988 Palestinian National Charter, international law, UN resolutions, and human rights principles. Key new provisions include granting the President the authority to appoint and dismiss a Vice President, and stipulating that the constitution will take effect following a national referendum approved by a majority of valid votes and published in the official gazette. However, the draft omits specific territorial boundaries, unlike the 2003 version. Legal experts such as Ibrahim al-Barghouti from the Palestinian Center for Legal and Judicial Independence 'Masaawa' raise concerns about the timing, questioning whether the interim constitution is appropriate given the ongoing existential threats and the absence of a fully realized state. Al-Barghouti criticizes the draft\u2019s vague terminology, such as 'judicial function' instead of 'legal profession,' and the lack of clear jurisdiction for civil courts in torture cases, which are currently handled by military courts, undermining judicial impartiality. Similarly, former Legislative Council Deputy Chairman Hasan Khreishah criticizes the committee\u2019s composition as unprofessional, dominated by political and factional figures rather than legal experts, and warns that the draft may serve external pressures, potentially undermining the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and ceding core national issues. Khreishah also argues it is premature to discuss a constitution amid ongoing Israeli military actions and the de facto annexation of the West Bank. The draft\u2019s release coincides with Abbas\u2019s commitment to hold presidential and parliamentary elections within one year after the Gaza war ends, with the interim constitution intended as a legal foundation for transitioning from the Palestinian Authority to a sovereign state.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 01:59 PM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/politics/2026/2/16/%d9%85%d8%b3%d9%88%d8%af%d8%a9-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%af%d8%b3%d8%aa%d9%88%d8%b1-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%81%d9%84%d8%b3%d8%b7%d9%8a%d9%86%d9%8a-%d8%a7%d9%84%d9%85%d8%a4%d9%82%d8%aa-%d9%85%d8%a7)\n\n**Palestinian Prisoner Rights Association Accuses Ben-Gvir of Stepping on Heads of Detainees at Ofer Prison**\nThe Palestinian Prisoner's Rights Association (Nadi al-Asir) reported on February 16, 2026, that Israeli Security Minister Itamar Ben-Gvir 'stepped on the heads' of Palestinian detainees during a raid on Section 26 of Ofer Prison on Friday, April 12, 2024. The raid, which occurred during the evening 'count' or security check, lasted approximately 15 minutes and involved police dogs, sound grenades, and extensive media coverage. Ben-Gvir was present for about an hour, delivering a provocative and degrading speech to the detainees. According to testimonies from detainees relayed by a visiting lawyer, Ben-Gvir personally stepped on their heads and filmed acts of humiliation and abuse. Detainees reported being forced to keep their heads and faces pressed to the ground to degrade them physically and psychologically. The association stated that these videos are part of a broader strategy by Ben-Gvir to gain domestic Israeli public support, promote his controversial 'Law of Execution of Prisoners'\u2014which passed its first reading in November 2025 but remains pending second and third readings\u2014and to perpetuate a campaign of systemic abuse. The organization claims this constitutes 'one of the main arenas of genocide' and cites that over 100 prisoners have died, with 88 identified, since the onset of the 2023 Gaza genocide. The association emphasized that the videos represent only a small fraction of systematic torture. It called for urgent international intervention to halt the ongoing genocide in prisons, allow international organizations to visit detainees, permit family visits, and impose sanctions on Israeli authorities to end impunity. Since Ben-Gvir assumed office in late 2022, conditions for Palestinian prisoners\u2014over 9,300 of whom are detained, including 350 children\u2014have drastically deteriorated, marked by severe malnutrition, medical neglect, and deaths. The report also notes that Israel intensified its repression of Palestinian prisoners following U.S.-backed military operations in Gaza that have killed over 72,000 Palestinians and injured over 171,000, mostly women and children. The context includes Israel\u2019s establishment in 1948 on occupied Palestinian land through armed Zionist militias that committed massacres and expelled hundreds of thousands of Palestinians.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 12:43 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84/%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%AF%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D8%B3%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%8A%D9%86%D9%8A-%D8%A8%D9%86-%D8%BA%D9%81%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B3-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%B1%D8%A4%D9%88%D8%B3-%D8%A3%D8%B3%D8%B1%D9%89-%D8%A8%D8%B3%D8%AC%D9%86-%D8%B9%D9%88%D9%81%D8%B1-/3831530)\n\n**Israel Approves Land Registration for Settlers in West Bank, Sparking Palestinian Outcry**\nOn February 15, 2026, Israel's Security Cabinet approved the registration of land owned by Israeli settlers in the West Bank, marking the first time since Israel's occupation of the territory following the 1967 war. The move aims to strengthen Israeli control and facilitate land purchases by settlers. The Palestinian Authority condemned the decision as a de facto annexation, calling it the beginning of a plan to entrench occupation through illegal settlement activities. Israel had previously strengthened its enforcement authority over Palestinians on February 8 to ease settlement land purchases, drawing international criticism. The West Bank is a key area for Palestinian aspirations of statehood, with most of it under Israeli military control and limited Palestinian Authority autonomy in certain regions. Prime Minister Netanyahu, ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections, has warned that Palestinian statehood efforts pose a security threat. Far-right Finance Minister Smotrich declared a commitment to a 'revolution in settlements' and strengthening control across the territory, while Defense Minister Katz called land registration a crucial security measure. The Security Cabinet stated the action was a proper response to what it described as illegal Palestinian land registration procedures, and the Foreign Ministry claimed the move promotes transparency and helps resolve land disputes. In 2024, the International Court of Justice (ICJ) issued an advisory opinion stating that Israel\u2019s occupation and settlement activities in Palestinian territories violate international law and must be ended as soon as possible; Israel has rejected this opinion.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 12:59 AM\nSource:[\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u65e5\u672c\u7248 \u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8](https://www.newsweekjapan.jp/headlines/world/2026/02/587657.php)\n\n**Israel's Government Opens Land Registry for Settlers in West Bank, Sparking International Condemnation**\nThe Israeli government approved new measures on February 15, 2026, to strengthen its control over the occupied West Bank (Cisjordania) by establishing a land registry to facilitate land purchases by Israeli settlers. The Palestinian Authority condemned the move as a 'de facto annexation' of occupied territory, a step that previous Israeli governments had resisted since 1967, when the region was captured during the Six-Day War. Cisjordania is claimed by Palestinians as part of a future independent state, with limited Palestinian self-governance in some areas and full Israeli military control elsewhere. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, facing elections in 2026, leads a coalition including hardline pro-settlement factions that advocate annexing the territory based on biblical and historical claims. Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a far-right figure, stated the government is continuing its 'settlement revolution' and reinforcing control across the territory. Defense Minister Israel Katz called the land registry a 'vital security measure' to ensure law enforcement and full operational freedom for Israel to protect citizens and national interests. The Israeli government claims the registry responds to 'illegal land registration processes' conducted by the Palestinian Authority. The Palestinian presidency rejected the move, asserting it marks the start of formal annexation plans aimed at entrenching occupation through illegal settlement activities. Former U.S. President Donald Trump has opposed Israeli annexation but has not halted the accelerated construction of settlements, which Palestinians argue undermines the viability of a future Palestinian state. In a non-binding 2024 advisory opinion, the International Court of Justice declared Israel\u2019s occupation and settlements in Palestinian territories illegal and called for their immediate termination. Israel disputes this, citing historical and biblical ties to the land.

The decision marks the first land registration process in West Bank since 1967. Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, facing elections later in 2026, views a Palestinian state as a security threat. His coalition includes right-wing members supportive of annexing West Bank territory, which Israel captured during the 1967 Middle East War and claims through biblical and historical ties.

Defense Minister Israel Katz called the registration a 'vital security measure' to ensure law enforcement and full operational freedom. The Israeli cabinet claimed the move responds to 'illegal land registration processes' by the Palestinian Authority and aims to end disputes. The Palestinian presidency rejected the decision, calling it a 'de facto annexation' and the beginning of an annexation plan to entrench occupation through illegal settlements.

This registration is part of a broader series of measures adopted earlier in February 2026 to expand Israeli control.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 05:08 PM\nSource:[PULZO](https://www.pulzo.com/mundo/israel-aprueba-nuevas-medidas-reforzar-control-cisjordania-PP5048336A)\n\n**Palestinian President Issues Decree Setting Dates for National Council Election and Fatah's 8th Conference**\nPalestinian President Mahmoud Abbas issued a presidential decree calling for the Palestinian people, both within Palestine and in the diaspora, to participate in the election of the Palestinian National Council on November 1, 2026.

According to the committee's spokesperson, Fared Tameel, elections will be held on April 25, 2026, to elect members of 420 local councils. The registration period for candidates will open on February 23, 2026, for one week. The committee confirmed that registration for the 2026 local elections has been closed at all registration centers, offices, and online platforms, in accordance with the approved timeline. The data verification and objection period will run from February 7 to February 9, allowing citizens to review and correct their information or file objections. There are 445 local authorities in Palestine: 420 in the West Bank and 25 in Gaza, including 161 municipal councils and 284 local councils (smaller than municipal councils). The committee cited complex logistical challenges in Gaza as the reason for not holding elections across the entire strip, stating that voting procedures in Deir al-Balah will differ from those in the West Bank, though details were not disclosed. The committee previously stated that elections in Gaza would be limited to Deir al-Balah to promote geographic and political unity and ensure citizens' democratic participation where possible. In 2021, local elections were held in the West Bank in two phases, while Gaza\u2019s elections were postponed due to unsuitable conditions. The decision coincides with the formation of the Palestinian committee to manage Gaza, chaired by Ali Shu'ath, expected to assume responsibilities in the coming days. Local councils are responsible for providing basic services such as water, sewage, and local infrastructure, but lack legislative authority. While many candidate lists are affiliated with political factions, independent lists are also permitted under the electoral system.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 09:09 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/news/2026/1/26/%D8%A8%D9%85%D8%B4%D8%A7%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A9-%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%AD-%D8%A5%D9%86%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%AA%D8%B3%D8%AC%D9%8A%D9%84)\n\n**Palestinian Official: Voter Registration Closes for Local Elections in West Bank**\nThe voter registration period for the upcoming local elections in the West Bank closed on Sunday, January 25, 2026, in preparation for the municipal elections scheduled for April 25, 2026. Palestinians will vote to elect 420 local councils in a rare democratic exercise in the occupied territories. Additionally, elections for the Deir al-Balah council in central Gaza will be held, according to Fared Tameel, spokesperson for the Palestinian Central Elections Committee, who confirmed that the elections in both the West Bank and Gaza will take place on April 25, 2026. The candidacy registration period will open on February 23 and last for one week. The Palestinian Authority, led by Fatah under President Mahmoud Abbas, is expected to dominate the candidate lists, given its control over the political landscape. It remains unclear whether Hamas, which administers parts of Gaza not under Israeli occupation, will participate in the elections.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 10:32 PM\nSource:[\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0623\u0647\u0631\u0627\u0645](https://gate.ahram.org.eg/News/5477856.aspx)\n\n**Palestinian Local Elections in Deir al-Balah, Gaza, Proceed Amid Ongoing Challenges**\nThe Palestinian Central Elections Committee announced on Monday, January 19, 2026, that local elections scheduled for April 2026 would be held exclusively in Deir al-Balah, central Gaza Strip, while simultaneously taking place in 420 local councils across the West Bank. The decision was justified by 'current difficult conditions in the Gaza Strip.' The committee cited a cabinet decision setting April 25, 2026, as the official date for local council elections nationwide. After assessing on-the-ground conditions in Gaza, the committee determined that holding elections across all 25 Gaza localities was not feasible at this time. The move aims to strengthen geographic and political unity between the two parts of Palestine and ensure citizens\u2019 right to democratic participation where possible. Palestine has a total of 445 local councils\u2014420 in the West Bank and 25 in Gaza\u2014comprising 161 municipal councils and 284 local councils (smaller than municipal councils). The committee urged all relevant parties, national forces, and civil society to support the electoral process in Deir al-Balah and reaffirmed its commitment to protecting citizens\u2019 right to vote. It expressed hope to complete the democratic process in the remaining Gaza localities once security and humanitarian conditions improve and a suitable environment is established. In November 2025, the Palestinian news agency Wafa reported that the Ministry of Local Government had announced the transition of municipal councils to interim administration starting December 11, 2025, due to the expiration of their four-year term. In 2021, local elections were held in the West Bank in two phases, while Gaza\u2019s elections were postponed indefinitely by the cabinet 'until conditions become suitable.' The announcement coincided with the formation of the Palestinian Committee for Gaza\u2019s Administration, chaired by Ali Sheth, who signed its mission statement on Sunday, marking the first official act of the committee. This development follows U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s announcement on Thursday, January 15, 2026, of the start of the second phase of the Gaza agreement, which ended a genocide war launched by Israel on October 8, 2023, lasting two years and resulting in over 71,000 Palestinian deaths and more than 171,000 injuries, along with the destruction of 90% of civilian infrastructure. The first phase of the agreement entered into effect on October 10, 2025, but Israel has continued committing hundreds of violations, leading to the deaths of 465 Palestinians and injuries to 1,287, most of whom were women and children.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 19, 2026 04:03 PM\nSource:[\u062c\u0631\u064a\u062f\u0629 \u0627\u0644\u0634\u0631\u0648\u0642](https://www.shorouknews.com/news/view.aspx?cdate=19012026&id=04038776-7f49-4b43-8d62-6557e0e1e751)\n\n**Local Elections (2026) | ECFR**\nThe next local elections in Palestine, including municipal and village council elections, are scheduled for 25 April 2026 in both the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.

This decision was made in accordance with Article (72) of Law Decree No. (23) of 2025, issued by President Mahmoud Abbas, which stipulates that the first local council elections must take place within six months of the law's enactment. As a result, local councils whose legal terms end before the election will function as interim governing bodies. The Cabinet also approved the appointment of an interim management committee for the Nuzlat Issa Village Council in Tubas and endorsed a draft amendment to the regulations governing the licensing of well drilling, water extraction, and well construction. Additionally, the Cabinet discussed progress on resolving outstanding financial settlements, including the ongoing arbitration process with the telecommunications company Ooredoo, led by an international arbitration firm. The government is also working with the International Telecommunication Union to secure necessary bandwidth for 4G and 5G services. The Cabinet expressed appreciation for international condemnation of settler violence and called for stronger measures to halt illegal annexations, settlement expansion, movement restrictions, and the withholding of Palestinian tax revenues. It reaffirmed that all international aid must be coordinated with Palestinian institutions and aligned with Palestinian law and international law. The Cabinet also congratulated the Hebron Rehabilitation Committee for winning the Global Housing Award, highlighting the importance of the award amid ongoing challenges to the Old City of Hebron. On the occasion of the International Day of Persons with Disabilities, the Cabinet affirmed that the rights of persons with disabilities are fundamental and that the government continues to support and empower this community, particularly amid the ongoing conflict in Gaza and military incursions in the West Bank.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[palsawa.com](https://palsawa.com/post/432680/%D9%85%D8%AC%D9%84%D8%B3-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%88%D8%B2%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D9%8A%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%86-%D8%B1%D8%B3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%A7-%D9%85%D9%88%D8%B9%D8%AF-%D8%A5%D8%AC%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%AA%D8%AE%D8%A7%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%A6%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D9%81%D9%84%D8%B3%D8%B7%D9%8A%D9%86)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
