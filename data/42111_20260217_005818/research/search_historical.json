Below is a consolidated chronology from 2005 through the present, highlighting every occasion on which the Central Elections Commission (CEC) or the Palestinian government (Council of Ministers / Cabinet) formally postponed, suspended, or cancelled a scheduled local-election round.  All dates are Gregorian.\n\n1. First local-election cycle, 2004-2005  \n   \u2022 Phase 1\u200323 Dec 2004 \u2013 held.  \n   \u2022 Phase 2\u200327 Jan 2005 \u2013 held.  \n   \u2022 Phase 3\u200305 May 2005 \u2013 held.  \n   \u2022 Phase 4\u200315 Dec 2005 \u2013 held.  \n   (No postponements in this first cycle; supervision was by the Higher Committee for Local Elections, not yet the CEC.) (Elections.ps \u201cPrevious Election Events\u201d).\n\n2. Second cycle, 2010-2013  \n   \u2022 Original call\u2003Feb 2010 for elections in July 2010.  \n   \u2022 10 Jun 2010\u2003Cabinet Decision No. 01/13/52 A/C.M/P.A  formally \u201cPostponed the Local Elections Date\u201d \u2013 first postponement. (Elections.ps \u201cPresidential decrees and Cabinet decisions\u201d).  \n   \u2022 Further postponement in 2011 \u2013 the government again deferred the vote that had been rescheduled for 2011 (Elections.ps \u201cPrevious Election Events\u201d notes the process \u201cwas otherwise postponed over two successive years\u201d).  \n   \u2022 10 Jul 2012\u2003Cabinet set a new date; first round finally held 20 Oct 2012, West Bank only.  \n   \u2022 Complementary rounds\u200322 Dec 2012 and 01 Jun 2013 \u2013 held to cover remaining municipalities.  No further delays once the process started.\n\n3. Third cycle, 2016-2017  \n   \u2022 21 Jun 2016\u2003Cabinet called elections for 08 Oct 2016 in West Bank & Gaza.  \n   \u2022 08 Sep 2016\u2003PA High Court suspended the vote; on 03 Oct 2016 it ruled it could proceed only in the West Bank.  \n   \u2022 04 Oct 2016\u2003Government accepted the ruling and \u201cdecided to postpone the vote by four months, until the beginning of 2017,\u201d citing CEC advice (Haaretz, 04 Oct 2016).  \n   \u2022 31 Jan 2017\u2003Cabinet Decision fixed a new date, 13 May 2017 \u2013 elections held that day in 326 of 391 West Bank localities (Elections.ps \u201cPrevious Election Events\u201d).  \n   \u2022 29 Jul 2017\u2003Complementary elections held in 32 additional localities \u2013 completed without postponement.\n\n4. Gaza-specific postponement, 2020  \n   \u2022 2020\u2003Cabinet Decision titled \u201cPostponement of Local Elections in the Southern Governorates\u201d formally deferred any municipal vote in Gaza that year (Elections.ps \u201cPresidential decrees and Cabinet decisions\u201d).  No West Bank election was scheduled in 2020, so only Gaza was affected.\n\n5. Fourth cycle, 2021-2022  \n   \u2022 06 Sep 2021\u2003Cabinet called a two-stage local election.  \n   \u2022 Stage 1\u200311 Dec 2021 \u2013 ballots cast in 154 small West Bank localities.  \n   \u2022 Stage 2\u200326 Mar 2022 \u2013 ballots cast in 50 larger municipalities.  \n   \u2022 Gaza was excluded de facto; there were no CEC or governmental postponements once dates were announced. (Elections.ps \u201cPrevious Election Events\u201d).\n\n6. Fifth cycle (scheduled), 2026  \n   \u2022 18 Dec 2025\u2003Council of Ministers Decision (CEC press release 5148) officially \u201cannounced the date for commencing local elections\u201d on 25 Apr 2026 and instructed the CEC to begin preparations.  \n   \u2022 02 Jan 2026\u2003CEC press release 5150 published the full legal calendar for all stages (registration, nomination, campaigning, polling-day 25 Apr 2026, and result publication) (\u201cThe CEC Announces the Legal Periods Associated with the Different Stages of the 2026 Local Elections\u201d, Elections.ps, PR 5150).  \n   \u2022 28 Jan 2026\u2003President Mahmoud Abbas issued a decree amending the Local-Elections Law to require all candidates to sign a pledge to the PLO\u2019s program; the Central Elections Commission circulated the decree the same day.  Media coverage (Times of Israel, 28 Jan 2026) stated the election is \u201cslated for April 25\u201d and did not report any change of date.  \n   \u2022 Sada News, early 2026, likewise notes that \u201cthe Cabinet had previously issued a decision to set the date for local authority elections in Palestine on 25/4/2026,\u201d with no indication of postponement.  \n\nPostponement / cancellation record summary (2005-2026):\n\u2022 10 Jun 2010 \u2013 Government postpones 2010 local elections (all areas).  \n\u2022 2011 (exact decision date not specified) \u2013 Second postponement of the same cycle.  \n\u2022 08 Sep 2016 \u2013 PA High Court freezes October 2016 vote; 04 Oct 2016 Cabinet moves it to early 2017 (all areas).  \n\u2022 2020 \u2013 Cabinet postpones elections in Gaza (\u201cSouthern Governorates\u201d) only.  \nThere have been no CEC/government postponements announced for the 2026 round as of mid-February 2026.\n\nStatements after 1 January 2026 that confirm or question the 25 Apr 2026 voting date:\n\n1. CEC press release 5150, 02 Jan 2026 \u2013 confirms the statutory schedule culminating in \u201cpolling day: Saturday 25 April 2026\u201d (Elections.ps PR 5150).  \n2. Times of Israel, 28 Jan 2026 \u2013 reports Abbas\u2019s new candidate-eligibility decree and explicitly refers to \u201cmunicipal elections slated for April 25,\u201d indicating the date stands (TimesofIsrael, 28 Jan 2026).  \n3. Sada News Agency report (2026) \u2013 states that \u201cthe Cabinet had previously issued a decision to set the date for local authority elections in Palestine on 25/4/2026,\u201d again reflecting that the timetable is intact (Sada News).  \n\nNo press item retrieved after 1 Jan 2026 indicates any intention by the CEC, the Council of Ministers, or the President to delay or cancel the 25 Apr 2026 poll.  Likewise, no CEC notice of suspension/postponement appears on the Commission\u2019s official \u201cPresidential Decrees and Cabinet Decisions\u201d page as of the latest available entry (Elections.ps, visited February 2026).\n\nInformation gaps\n\u2022 The exact date and text of the 2011 Cabinet decision that effected the second postponement of the 2010/11 cycle are referenced but not reproduced in the public \u201cPrevious Election Events\u201d narrative; obtaining the formal resolution number would complete the timeline.  \n\u2022 The CEC website may publish additional press releases or operational updates closer to polling day; continuous monitoring is required to detect any late postponement.  \n\u2022 No source yet details whether the 2020 Gaza-only postponement was ever rescinded or replaced by an alternative voting arrangement; clarification would round out the postponement log for that year.  \n\nAt present, however, every authoritative statement issued in 2026 affirms that Palestinian local elections are still scheduled for 25 April 2026, and the historical record of postponements is confined to the years 2010, 2011, 2016, and 2020.</Agent_report>\n"
