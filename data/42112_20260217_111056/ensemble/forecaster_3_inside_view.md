Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
This resolves “Yes” if, between Feb 17, 2026 and May 1, 2026, a court or competent electoral authority nullifies the Jan 12, 2026 THA election outcome or orders a re-run that flips which party controls the THA; otherwise “No”.

(a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality/date; fact vs opinion)
Local/primary election-administration sources
- EBC TT notice on nomination forms (Ebctt.com, Dec 9, 2025): Administrative posting about forms. High-quality official source, but not about disputes/overturns. Purely factual; no relevance to post-election litigation risk.
- Newsday nomination-day coverage (Newsday, Dec 19–20, 2025): Reports smooth nomination proceedings and number of candidates filed. Reputable local media; factual event reporting; not informative about post-election reversal risk.

Election outcome/process reporting (from your outside-view packet; dated but still strong context)
- Trinidad Express election coverage (Trinidad Express, Jan 13, 2026): Reports TPP won all 15 seats; election officials indicated no major problems. Reputable local outlet; mostly factual. (Any partisan quotes are opinions, not evidence of irregularities.)
- Newsday recount story (Newsday, Jan 15, 2026): Reports EBC conducted two recounts at PNM request; recounts upheld results; THA inauguration proceeded. Reputable local outlet; factual reporting of official steps.

Institutional/legal context (outside-view packet)
- ConstitutionNet explainer (May 23, 2018): General governance background; decent quality but indirect for this question.
- “Agent report” historical synthesis (jurisdictional history of petitions): Not a primary source; however it summarizes a key structural claim (no successful nullifications; long timelines). Treat as medium quality unless cross-verified—still useful for base rates.

AskNews articles (Feb 2026 feed)
- Items about India/UK/Nigeria/Egypt/Portugal/Italy/Mexico/Nepal elections: High variance in outlet quality; all are substantively unrelated to Tobago/THA and do not inform the probability of a Tobago election overturn. Discard for forecasting this question.

Net: The only sources with direct bearing are (i) local reporting on the clean result + recounts holding, and (ii) the structural/timeline base-rate claim about how rare/slow reversals are in Trinidad & Tobago.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted with the provided system)
Strong evidence
- Structural/timing constraint: Trinidad & Tobago election petitions historically take months and have (per the synthesis) never successfully nullified an overall national/THA election result. This is exactly the relevant mechanism: courts move slowly; overturns are extraordinary.
- Status quo institutional reality: THA was seated and governance proceeded after recounts upheld results (a “settling” dynamic that reduces urgency and judicial appetite for disruptive remedies).

Moderate evidence
- Clean administrative signals in contemporaneous reporting: No credible reports (from the election authority or major local media) of systemic procedural breakdowns that would justify an island-wide remedy, especially one that flips control.
- Magnitude of result: a 15–0 sweep implies that even if one constituency had issues, flipping overall control via court-ordered re-run is harder (requires broad invalidation or many seats in play).

Weak evidence
- Absence of media coverage of petitions as of today: “No news” is not definitive; filings can be quiet, and hearing dates may emerge later.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Resolution window: 73 days (Feb 17, 2026 → May 1, 2026).
- If timeframe were halved (~36 days): probability would fall further because even fewer chances for a petition to be heard and decided (and for any remedy to be an overturn/re-run changing control).
- If timeframe were doubled (~146 days from today): probability would rise somewhat because Trinidad & Tobago petition timelines (often many months) would become more compatible with a decision arriving in-window—though the “overturn that flips control” hurdle would still keep it low.

(d) Justification (inside view vs outside view)
Outside view base rate (given): 0.3%, driven by (i) zero successful nullifications historically, (ii) short windows relative to legal timelines, and (iii) lack of reported irregularities.

Inside-view adjustments from current information:
- The key “new” fact today is not a scandal or petition momentum; it’s that we are already on Feb 17 and the window starts now, leaving only 73 days for an overturn event to occur. That is even tighter than the already-tight 109-day post-election window used in the outside-view reasoning.
- There is still no credible, Tobago-specific reporting in the provided current feed suggesting (a) a filed petition with expedited scheduling, (b) a finding of systemic fraud, or (c) an EBC admission of material error—any of which could make this case non-analogous to the historical reference class.

So I slightly revise downward from 0.3% because the effective remaining time for the decisive event is shorter, while there is no offsetting new pro-“Yes” signal.

Probability calibration
- Start from outside view: 0.3%.
- Downward pressure:
  - Only 73 days left in the resolution window starting today (strong, directly relevant timing constraint).
  - No Tobago-specific indicators of an active, fast-moving legal process that could culminate in a control-flipping remedy by May 1.
- Upward pressure:
  - Non-zero tail risk: a petition could already exist and could be fast-tracked if allegations are extreme; small jurisdictions can sometimes move quickly in exceptional cases.

Net inside-view probability: 0.2% (about 1 in 500).

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Between Feb 17 and May 1, a court/EBC must nullify/redo Jan 12 THA result in a way that flips which party controls the THA.
2. Outside view base rate: 0.3%.
3. Consistency check: 0.2 out of 100 times, such a control-flipping overturn happens by May 1, 2026.
4. Key evidence (3–5):
   - Only 73 days remain in-window; petition resolution is typically slow.
   - No historical precedent (per synthesis) for successful overall election nullification in T&T.
   - Recounts upheld results; no credible systemic-irregularity reporting in local sources provided.
   - 15–0 result makes a control-flip remedy harder (needs broad invalidation).
5. Blind spot: A quietly filed petition alleging major procedural illegality gets expedited and decided unusually fast; would push probability up (perhaps into ~1–3%).
6. Status quo outcome: With no escalation signals and tight time remaining, “No” is strongly favored; a small nudge toward status quo is appropriate.

Probability: 0.2%
