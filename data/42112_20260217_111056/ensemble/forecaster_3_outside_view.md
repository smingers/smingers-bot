Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis

1) **Trinidad Express (Jan 13, 2026) — “Tobago kicks out the PNM”**  
- **What it says (facts):** TPP won **all 15** THA districts in the Jan 12 election. The Chief Election Officer is quoted indicating the poll progressed well, with only minor, resolved issues (e.g., some voter confusion about polling locations in one area).  
- **What it says (opinions):** Party statements framing the win as “historic,” priorities, etc.  
- **Quality / relevance:** Mainstream local outlet; relatively proximate in time. Most relevant factual nugget is the **absence of reported “major issues”** from the election administration side—this points away from a legal overturn.

2) **Newsday (Jan 15, 2026) — “EBC confirms TPP clean sweep… unchanged after 2 recounts”**  
- **What it says (facts):** The **EBC conducted recounts** in two districts at PNM request; results **unchanged**. Provides post-recount tallies and notes the inauguration proceeding.  
- **Quality / relevance:** Strong relevance and fairly high credibility because it is tied to an **official EBC media release** and describes a formal recount process. This reduces the probability that a later challenge quickly uncovers decisive counting errors—especially within the short window to May 1.

3) **ConstitutionNet (May 23, 2018) — Tobago self-government reforms backgrounder**  
- **What it says (facts):** Background on Tobago autonomy debates and THA institutional setup.  
- **Quality / relevance:** Credible institutional background, but **not directly informative** about the base rate of election annulments or the likelihood of a 2026 election being overturned.

4) **Agent report — historical instances / timeline claims**  
- **What it says (facts, as claimed):** (i) No known cases since independence of courts overturning parliamentary/THA elections; (ii) the 2021 THA re-run stemmed from a tie/legislative fix rather than a court voiding results; (iii) the 2015 election petitions took ~4 months (first decision) to ~9 months (appeal).  
- **Quality / relevance:** Potentially useful synthesis but **should be treated cautiously** (secondary compilation, possible missing older cases). Still, even if imperfect, it aligns with a broader “stable-election-administration” pattern and, importantly, highlights that **legal timelines tend to be longer than 3.5 months**.

### (b) Reference class analysis

Plausible reference classes:

1) **Trinidad & Tobago election challenges that actually overturn results (national + THA), post-independence**  
- **Suitability:** High—same legal culture, courts, EBC.  
- **Problem:** Small sample; “0 events” is plausible but uncertain due to incomplete historical visibility.

2) **THA elections specifically (1980–present) and whether outcomes were nullified / re-run due to official action**  
- **Suitability:** Very high institutional match.  
- **Key note:** The one salient disruption in recent memory (2021 re-run) was **not** a classic court-driven overturn for misconduct; it was a **structural tie** plus legislative remedy.

3) **Commonwealth Caribbean small-democracy election annulments (court-ordered re-runs) within ~3 months**  
- **Suitability:** Medium—broader base rate, but different statutes and political dynamics.

**Most suitable choice:** (1) + (2). The forecasting question is explicitly about **Trinidad & Tobago’s THA**, and the mechanism is **court or electoral authority action**.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Forecasting window (per question):** From **today (Feb 17, 2026)** until **May 1, 2026** ≈ **73 days (~2.4 months)**.  
- **Practical implication:** Even if a petition or judicial review is filed promptly, getting to a decisive, election-altering order in ~10 weeks is hard. The agent report’s cited example (2015 petitions) suggests **months** even for dismissals; a successful, highly consequential ruling would often take at least as long, and then a re-run would still need to occur and (per resolution wording) **change control** before May 1—an additional compression.  
- **Status quo if nothing changes:** TPP remains in full control (15/15), already recount-tested in two constituencies.

### (d) Justification (outside view)

Outside view starts with the institutional/base-rate reality: in stable democracies, **post-election reversals of overall outcomes are rare**; in Trinidad & Tobago, they appear **extremely rare to possibly unprecedented**, especially via courts voiding an election.

Then add two outside-view amplifiers that push probability further down:

1) **Short time-to-resolution (73 days):** Even jurisdictions that sometimes void results typically do not do so quickly—especially not in a way that culminates in a re-run that flips control inside the same short window.  
2) **Magnitude of the required reversal:** This is not a 8–7 or 1-seat control margin. TPP won **15–0**. For “control” to change by May 1 would likely require either (i) a **sweeping annulment** (overall nullification) and rapid re-run, or (ii) some extraordinary authority action. Both are much rarer than seat-level corrections.

Countervailing considerations (why not near-zero):  
- A low but nonzero chance of an unexpected scandal (e.g., systemic ineligibility, major procedural violation) that prompts unusually fast judicial intervention.  
- Uncertainty in the historical record (the “never happened” claim could be incomplete).

Net: the outside view strongly favors **“No”**, with a small tail risk.

Outside view calibration:

- **Tether point from sources:** The agent report suggests **0 known court-ordered overturns** since independence and that meaningful election litigation timelines commonly exceed the available window. With “0 events” in a small reference class, I avoid assigning literal 0%.  
- **Base-rate reasoning (informal):** If the long-run rate of any election-overturning action is on the order of ~1% per election or less in this setting, the probability of it happening **and completing (or at least legally overturning control) within ~2.4 months** is a fraction of that—suggesting something like **sub-1%**.  
- **Upset/black-swan adjustment:** Add a small premium for unknown unknowns and incomplete history, but keep it constrained by the severe time compression and the 15–0 margin.
