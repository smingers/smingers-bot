Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological order, key factual take-aways, quality)

a. Trinidad Express, 13 Jan 2026 – “Tobago kicks out the PNM”  
   • Facts: EBC preliminary results show Tobago People’s Party (TPP) wins all 15 seats; Chief Election Officer reports only minor, resolved issues.  
   • Quality: Major national daily; published the day after the poll; highly reliable for official numbers; entirely factual quotes, little opinion.

b. Newsday, 15 Jan 2026 – “EBC confirms TPP clean sweep… unchanged after 2 recounts”  
   • Facts: At PNM request, formal recounts in two districts completed; margins unchanged; EBC press release cited.  
   • Quality: Local paper of record; relies on primary document; strong evidentiary weight.

c. Medium op-ed, 20 Dec 2025 – Farley Augustine on US radar  
   • Facts: None on election integrity; opinion on autonomy push.  
   • Quality: Personal blog; low relevance, low evidentiary weight.

d. EBC press notice, 20 Dec 2025 – 42 candidates filed; nomination day “smooth”.  
   • Facts: No irregularities flagged.  
   • Quality: Primary administrative source; moderate weight as process marker.

e. Remaining AskNews articles (India, Nigeria, Egypt, Italy, etc.)  
   • Facts: Concern other jurisdictions; zero relevance.  
   • Quality: Ignored for forecast.

f. Agent-compiled historic note – no record of THA or national elections ever being judicially overturned; 2015 petition took 4–9 mo.  
   • Facts: Historical synthesis; probable but not fully audited; moderate weight.

2. Evidence analysis (weighing)

Strong evidence  
• Two independent mainstream papers, citing EBC, state election ran smoothly and recounts confirmed the landslide.  
• Structural factor: Trinidad & Tobago courts/EBC have no precedent of voiding entire THA elections since 1980.

Moderate evidence  
• Typical legal timelines for election petitions (>4 mo) extend beyond the 73-day window → mechanism unlikely to finish in time.  
• 15–0 seat margin means even partial seat losses would not flip control; only a total annulment followed by a re-run could.

Weak evidence  
• Augustine’s autonomy rhetoric could conceivably fuel constitutional litigation, but no filing or legal theory has surfaced.  
• Unknown unknowns (e.g., mass ineligibility revelation).

Net directional push: all strong and moderate evidence point toward the status-quo “No”.

3. Timeframe analysis  
• 73 days remain until 1 May 2026. Typical first-instance rulings in Trinidad & Tobago appear ≥120 days; appeals longer.  
• If the window were doubled to ~150 days, I would raise the probability to ~2 %, chiefly because a first-instance ruling could conceivably land; halved to ~36 days, I would drop to ~0.2 %.

4. Justification / adjustment from outside view  

Outside view base rate (calculated earlier): 0.37 %.

Inside view adjustments:  
+0.15  pp for possibility that an unprecedented, fast-tracked constitutional complaint surfaces (black-swan allowance).  
-0.10  pp because recounts already addressed the only two constituencies formally queried, reducing litigants’ leverage.  
Net ≈ 0.42 %. Rounded conservatively upward for model uncertainty → 0.6 %.

Probability calibration

Interpretation sentence: About 1 out of every 170 elections like this would see the result overturned within 73 days.

Checklist:

1. Paraphrase: “Between now (17 Feb 2026) and 1 May 2026, will a court or the EBC nullify the 12 Jan 2026 THA election or order a re-run that flips Assembly control?”

2. Outside view: 0.37 % (never happened before; very rare globally).

3. Consistency check: “In roughly 1 of 170 cases, the criteria are met.” Sounds plausible given history.

4. Key evidence (short).  
   i. No historical precedent of THA election annulment.  
   ii. EBC certified 15–0 sweep; two recounts confirmed.  
   iii. Legal petitions typically exceed 4 months to resolve.  
   iv. Only 73 days left.  
   v. No allegations of systemic irregularities reported.

5. Blind-spot scenario: A court finds that the EBC unlawfully rejected an entire opposing party slate (e.g., nomination paperwork flaw), voiding the election in one stroke and ordering an emergency poll before May. Would raise probability to ~10 %.

6. Status quo outcome: Nothing happens → TPP keeps control; inertia favours “No”.

Probability: 0.6%
