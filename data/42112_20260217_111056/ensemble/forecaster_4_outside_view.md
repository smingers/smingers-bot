Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Trinidad Express, 13 Jan 2026 – straight news on the 12 Jan election outcome. Factual elements: 15-0 sweep by the Tobago People’s Party (TPP), EBC comment that the poll “progressed” well. Opinions are limited to partisan victory speeches. Date is one day after the vote; source is a nationally recognised daily – high factual reliability for basic results, low weight for partisan opinions.  
2. Newsday, 15 Jan 2026 – reports the two EBC-supervised recounts requested by the opposition PNM. Both recounts confirmed the original tallies. The piece quotes the official EBC media release; essentially pure fact, negligible opinion. Very strong source quality for procedural history, dated two days after recounts.  
3. ConstitutionNet, 23 May 2018 – analytical background on Tobago’s constitutional status. Good for long-run institutional context, but its content predates the forecast window by eight years and does not speak to litigation frequencies; medium relevance.  
4. Agent-compiled historical report (undated but generated for this exercise) – collates court-case histories and EBC actions since independence. Cites public records (Freedom House, Newsday, official law reports). While produced by an LLM, every factual claim can be cross-checked in open sources; I judge it a credible high-level summary, especially where it provides verifiable dates and outcomes. Opinions are minimal.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates considered:  
• All elections in Trinidad & Tobago overturned by court/EBC since independence (1962).  
• All Tobago House of Assembly elections reversed by any mechanism.  
• Caribbean small-island election nullifications generally.  

The first class is the most pertinent: it shares the same legal framework, the same EBC, the same courts, and the same political culture. The THA is governed by the national Constitution and courts, so lumping THA and parliamentary elections together is appropriate.

Empirical count from that class (Agent report, verified spot-checks): about 27 nationwide or THA elections; zero were nullified by a court or by the EBC. One THA re-run (2021) occurred, but it followed a statutory amendment, not an annulment, and it took ten months. Therefore the historical base rate of “result overturned” is 0/27.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today: 17 Feb 2026. Resolution deadline: 1 May 2026 → 73 days.  
Historical petition timelines: the only litigated case that went the distance (2015 UNC petitions) took nine months from filing to final appellate ruling—triple the window we are examining. No example exists of a decisive court order within three months of polling day, let alone within 2½ months of “today”. The procedural clock (filing → High Court → Court of Appeal, sometimes → Privy Council) all but guarantees that even a meritorious petition could not finish by 1 May.

(d) Justification  
Frequency: 0/27 elections overturned = 0%.  
Using Laplace’s rule of succession to avoid the zero-probability trap: (1 success)/(27+2) ≈ 3.4 % lifetime chance that any given election could be overturned at any point.  

Tempo adjustment: Historically, the shortest full litigation cycle (and it still failed) was about four months; successful cycles, if they ever happened, would almost surely be longer. The odds that an overturn—already a <4 % event—also finishes inside a 73-day window appear an order of magnitude smaller. Conservatively multiplying the 3.4 % base by 0.15 (≈ chance that, if an overturn ever occurs, it does so within ~¼ of the historical minimum duration) yields ~0.5 %.  

Institutional signals:  
• No Trinidad & Tobago court has ever voided an election result; judges have shown pronounced deference to the EBC.  
• The EBC has already certified the 2026 count and performed recounts with no change—information I note but do not treat as inside-view evidence for the purpose of this baseline.  
These reinforce, rather than weaken, the low base rate.

Outside view calibration:

Starting point (Laplace): 3.4 %  
Apply timing discount to reflect the 73-day limit: ×0.15 → 0.51 %  
Add a small cushion for model uncertainty (e.g., undiscovered historical anomalies, unusually rapid court action): +0.2 %  

Calibrated outside-view probability: 0.7 %
