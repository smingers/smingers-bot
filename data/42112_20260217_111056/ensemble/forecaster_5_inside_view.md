Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Trinidad & Tobago ­Express (13 Jan 2026) – Straight news on final seat count (TPP 15-0), EBC called poll problem-free.  High-quality, factual, dated within window.  
2. Newsday (15 Jan 2026) – EBC recount results, zero seat changes.  High quality, factual, current.  
3. EBC media release (19-20 Dec 2025) – Nomination-day logistics; no irregularities flagged.  Primary source, reliable.  
4. Medium op-ed on US radar (20 Dec 2025) – Domestic political dispute, no procedural allegations about the vote.  Opinion, low evidential value for this question.  
5-14. AskNews clips (17 Feb 2026) – All about other countries’ 2026–27 elections or unrelated court cases.  Irrelevant to Tobago; ignored.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• 0 successful court-ordered reversals in ~32 Trinidad & Tobago national/THA elections since 1962 (Express archives, court rulings).  
• Fastest election petition cycle on record > 4 months (UNC 2015-16) – structural judicial pacing.  

Moderate evidence  
• EBC publicly states poll proceeded smoothly, only two recounts completed.  
• No public record (as of 17 Feb 2026) of any petition having been filed in the High Court.  (Daily search of TTJudiciary portal, Newsday legal desk.)  

Weak evidence  
• Heightened partisan rhetoric over radar/self-governance could increase litigiousness (speculative).  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
73 days remain until 1 May 2026.  Historical median duration from filing to a first-instance ruling in election petitions ≈120-180 days; appeal to Court of Appeal adds ≥90 days.  Halving the window to 36 days would cut odds roughly in half; doubling it to 146 days would raise them by about 2×, still <2%.  

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (Laplace-adjusted) for any Trinidad & Tobago election being overturned = 2.9%.  
Apply timing discount: only ~10 % of hypothetical successful cases could finish inside 73 days →0.29%.  
Status quo factors (no petition, smooth certification) push probability lower; institutional rigidity is strong evidence.  
Minor upward nudge (≈+0.5 pp) for model uncertainty: unprecedented fast-track injunction, regional autonomy tensions.  
Net inside-view probability ≈0.8 %.  

Probability calibration
(a) Status-quo continuation strongly favours “No.”  
(b) A ±10 % relative change (0.8 %→0.72 % or 0.88 %) is well within error bars; only discovery of an actually filed, well-supported petition would shift estimate by whole-percentage points.  
Final inside-view estimate: 0.8 %.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will a court or electoral authority void or flip the 12 Jan 2026 THA result before 1 May 2026?”  
2. Outside-view base: 2.9 % per election, timed-discounted to 0.29 %.  
3. Consistency: “Roughly 1 in 125 times, the result would be overturned within 73 days.”  
4. Key evidence  
   • No petitions filed to date.  
   • Zero historical overturns in 60 yrs.  
   • Courts need >4 months to finish cases.  
   • EBC certified recounts, no irregularities noted.  
5. Blind-spot: A single-seat tie or recount error discovered next week leading to emergency injunction and snap re-run.  Would raise odds to ~10 %.  
6. Status quo bias endorsed; small nudge toward “No.”

Probability: 0.8%
