Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Trinidad Express, 13 Jan 2026 – Straight news report written the morning after the vote.  Factual content: seat count (TPP 15–0), statement by the Elections and Boundaries Commission (EBC) that “the day progressed” without major problems.  Opinions: celebratory comments by TPP officials.  Credibility: high; Trinidad Express is a long-established national daily.  
2. Newsday, 15 Jan 2026 – Factual recount numbers released by the EBC, confirms two recounts changed nothing, provides vote margins.  Opinions are limited to routine political remarks.  Credibility: high; source is the official EBC release.  
3. ConstitutionNet, 23 May 2018 – Background explainer on Tobago’s quest for autonomy.  Purely historical/institutional; no causal claims about election litigation.  Credibility: good but dated; not directly germane to post-election challenges.  
4. Agent report (2026) – Synthetic review of court records and press archives.  Key facts: (i) since independence no Trinidad & Tobago court has ever voided a parliamentary or THA election; (ii) only one THA re-run (2021) occurred and it stemmed from legislative action, not a judicial or electoral nullification; (iii) the only modern petitions that reached judgment (UNC 2015) were dismissed nine months after filing.  While produced by an LLM agent, the items cited (court rulings, statutes, newspaper dates) are checkable and accord with publicly available records.  I treat the factual claims as highly plausible but assign them slightly lower weight than the newspaper articles.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates:  
1. “All elections worldwide” – too broad; legal norms vary enormously.  
2. “Commonwealth Caribbean election results” – better, but countries such as Guyana or Jamaica have different judicial track records.  
3. “All elections in Trinidad & Tobago (House of Representatives and THA) since 1962” – same legal framework, similar petition rules, adequate sample size (~32 nationwide/assembly contests).  
4. “THA elections only” – perfect institutional match but tiny n (≈14 since 1980).  
I adopt reference class 3 and use 4 as a cross-check.

Empirical frequency from class 3: 0 overturns / ~32 elections = 0%.  To avoid a zero estimate I apply Laplace’s rule of succession: (0 + 1)/(32 + 2) ≈ 2.9%.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time until resolution window closes: 73 days (17 Feb → 1 May 2026).  
Historical pace: the fastest full litigation cycle we can document (UNC petitions, 2015–16) took 4 months at the High Court and 9 months to reach final appellate dismissal.  The 2021 THA legislative re-run required ten months.  Therefore, even if a successful petition were filed today, the odds of a final, election-altering order emerging in < 2.5 months are drastically lower than the unconditional base rate.

Rough hazard adjustment: assume petition processing time is at least 6 months in 90% of cases.  That implies ≤10% of any hypothetical successful challenges conclude within our 2.5-month horizon.

(d) Justification  
1. Structural rarity: Six decades without a single judicial nullification shows strong institutional inertia toward upholding certified results.  
2. Procedural drag: Courts and the EBC work on timelines substantially longer than the window remaining.  
3. Status quo bias: The EBC has already certified the recounts; no public evidence indicates that any party has even filed a petition.  
4. Given a 2.9% lifetime overturn probability (per election), multiplying by an estimated 10% chance of completion before 1 May yields ≈0.29%.  I round upward modestly to reflect residual model uncertainty, producing an outside-view probability just over half a percent.

Outside view calibration:
• Anchor: 2.9% (Laplace-adjusted historical base rate per election).  
• Timing discount: ×0.10 for the short 73-day window ⇒ 0.29%.  
• Uncertainty buffer: +0.3 percentage points (to cover the possibility that an unprecedented fast-track case arises).  
• Result: 0.6%.  
This expresses roughly 1 chance in 170 that the official result is overturned before 1 May 2026—consistent with the extreme rarity of such events and the short time left.

Outside View Prediction:
0.6 %
