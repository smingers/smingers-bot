# Summary of Article: "Towards a Tobago self-government? Constitutional reforms in Trinidad and Tobago"

**Source:** ConstitutionNet  
**Date:** May 23, 2018

## Key Facts and Context:

**Geographic and Demographic Information:**
- Tobago has a land mass of 116 square miles and a population of 60,000
- Tobago has been seeking greater autonomy from Trinidad for several decades

**Historical Background:**
- Tobago and Trinidad have different constitutional histories
- The two islands were united by an 1888 Order-in-Council
- In 1898, Tobago became a mere district of Trinidad and Tobago
- First demands for internal self-government for Tobago began in 1977

**Current Governance Structure:**
- The Tobago House of Assembly (THA) was established through the Tobago House of Assembly Act in 1980
- The THA was enshrined in the Constitution through a 1996 amendment
- The THA has an Executive Council consisting of a Chief Secretary and Secretaries
- The THA has responsibility over matters including tourism, environment, health services, and education (per Fifth Schedule)
- However, the Executive Council remains subject to the general control and direction of the central government
- The THA can propose bills to be transmitted to Cabinet, but no such bills have ever been enacted

**2018 Reform Proposal:**
- As of May 2018, a Joint Select Committee (JSC) of the Trinidad and Tobago Parliament was reviewing The Constitution (Amendment) (Tobago Self-Government) Bill 2018
- The JSC was due to report back to Parliament by July 31 (2018)
- The Bill is supported by Prime Minister Keith Rowley (himself a Tobagonian native)
- The Bill would require approval by three-quarters of the House of Assembly and two-thirds of the Senate
- The article notes concerns about the slow pace of reform and popular preoccupation with practical issues potentially derailing the process

**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off and does not provide complete information about the specific provisions of the 2018 Bill or the outcome of the reform process.

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide historical instances where Trinidad and Tobago courts or the Elections and Boundaries Commission nullified or ordered reruns of parliamentary or Tobago House of Assembly elections; include dates, parties involved, outcomes, and average time from filing to decision.
1. Tobago House of Assembly (THA) ­– 2021 tie and 2021 re-run  
   • First election: 25 January 2021. Result: 6–6 tie between the People’s National Movement (PNM) and the Progressive Democratic Patriots (PDP).  
   • Because the THA Act made no provision for a tie, the central Parliament passed amending legislation in March 2021 and an accompanying Elections and Boundaries Commission (EBC) report in September 2021 to increase the number of elected districts from 12 to 15.  
   • Re-run election: 6 December 2021 (organised by the EBC). Outcome: PDP 14 seats, PNM 1 seat, ending decades of PNM control (Freedom House, 2022).  
   • Triggering body: The legislative amendment enabled – and the EBC scheduled – a full fresh election; the courts were not involved.  
   • Time from impasse to formal decision to re-run: roughly 2–3 months (Jan 25 election → March legislation).  
   • Time from impasse to new vote: 10 months (Jan 25 → Dec 6).

2. National parliamentary elections – seat-level or nationwide nullifications  
   • 2015 General Election: Two United National Congress (UNC) petitions sought to invalidate results in six marginal constituencies. In 2016 the Court of Appeal dismissed the petitions; the seats and overall result stood. No by-election was ordered (referenced in Global Voices, 2020, which notes the 2015 litigation’s failure).  
   • 2020 General Election: UNC recount requests in five seats and public talk of a “total nullification” petition (Newsday, 10 Aug 2020); no petition succeeded and no court annulled any seat.  
   • 2025 Snap General Election: as of 13 Feb 2026 there is no public record of any successful challenge to the 28 Apr 2025 outcome.  
   • Historical record searches (press archives, law reports) show no instance since Independence (1962) in which a Trinidad and Tobago court has voided either (a) an entire parliamentary election or (b) an individual constituency election, nor has the EBC ever on its own authority ordered a parliamentary by-election because a result was declared void.

3. Average timeline from filing to decisive ruling  
   • Only one credible case reached judgment on the merits: the 2015 UNC petitions.  
        – Filing: September 2015.  
        – High Court dismissal: 8 January 2016 (≈4 months).  
        – Court of Appeal dismissal: 27 June 2016 (≈9 months from filing).  
   • Because the petitions failed, there is no data point for how long it takes between a successful petition and a fresh poll.  
   • For the THA example, 10 months elapsed between the tied poll and the re-run, but that window includes legislative action rather than judicial proceedings.  
   • Taken together, the empirical record shows:  
        – Average time from a filing that ultimately fails to a final appellate ruling: ~9 months.  
        – No historical observation of the timeline from filing to an overturning judgment, because no such judgment has ever been issued.

4. Key take-aways for the forecasting question (“Will the 12 Jan 2026 THA result be overturned before 1 May 2026?”)  
   • Frequency: In 62 years of elections, there has been exactly one forced fresh THA election and zero court-ordered annulments of parliamentary or THA polls.  
   • Institutional culture: Courts have shown deference to EBC decisions; petitions are routinely dismissed.  
   • Procedural pace: Even unsuccessful challenges have taken 4–9 months to reach final judgment. The interval from 12 Jan 2026 to 1 May 2026 is 3 ½ months, shorter than any historical petition cycle.  
   • Therefore, precedent suggests both (a) an overturn is highly improbable and (b) the statutory and judicial timetables make it exceedingly difficult for any petition filed after certification of the 2026 result (mid-January) to wend its way through the courts and produce a final, election-altering order by 1 May 2026.

Remaining information gaps  
• No example of a successful constituency-level petition prior to 2015 turned up in press or legal databases consulted; if one existed several decades ago it would slightly qualify the “never” statement above.  
• Precise filing and judgment dates for older petitions (e.g., those filed in the 1960s–1990s) were not located in open-source newspaper archives.

Overall conclusion  
Since Independence, Trinidad and Tobago has never had a parliamentary or THA election overturned by the courts, and the sole rerun (THA 2021) came from legislative intervention, not a judicial or EBC nullification of results. The average timeline for petitions that reached final judgment is roughly nine months, and there is no precedent for a decisive reversal inside the 3 ½-month window relevant to the 2026 THA forecast.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
