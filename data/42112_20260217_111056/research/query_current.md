Analysis:
The key to this forecast is whether any credible legal or administrative effort is underway that could nullify, recount, or order a fresh Tobago House of Assembly (THA) election before 1 May 2026. Relevant information therefore includes: (1) the certified January 12 2026 THA results and which party/coalition took control; (2) statements by losing parties or independents about filing election petitions; (3) announcements or documents from Trinidad & Tobago’s Elections and Boundaries Commission (EBC); (4) High Court filings, injunctions, or rulings concerning the 2026 THA election; and (5) commentary from constitutional lawyers or political analysts on the likelihood/timeline of a re-run. Any indication that a petition has already been accepted for hearing, or that the EBC itself has questioned the count, would materially raise the probability of an overturn.
