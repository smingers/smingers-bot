Analysis:
To gauge how likely the 12 Jan 2026 Tobago House of Assembly result might be overturned, it helps to know:  
• Whether past THA or Trinidad & Tobago general elections have ever been voided, re-run, or had seat counts altered by courts or the Elections and Boundaries Commission (EBC).  
• The legal mechanisms and historical frequency of successful election petitions in the country and, more broadly, the English-speaking Caribbean.  
• Any immediate post-2026-election litigation or recount requests already reported.  
Discovering precedents (or their absence) and learning how long related court cases normally take will provide an outside view on the probability of a reversal before 1 May 2026.
