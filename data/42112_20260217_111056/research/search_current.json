The Election Commission is anticipated to announce the election schedule in mid-March 2026, as confirmed by sources from the Times Network Hindi. The elections will be conducted on different dates across the states and union territory, with the official announcement expected to be made simultaneously.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 10:29 AM\nSource:[Times Network Hindi](https://www.timesnowhindi.com/india/polls-schedule-announcement-for-4-states-1-ut-likely-in-mid-march-polls-in-april-sources-article-153629008)\n\n**A simple guide to the May elections in England, Scotland and Wales**\nOn Thursday, 7 May 2026, millions of voters in England, Scotland, and Wales will participate in a major set of elections, the largest since the 2024 general election. In England, 136 local councils will hold elections for approximately 5,000 seats, including 30 councils that were previously delayed to May 2027 but now proceed in May 2026 after a government U-turn prompted by legal challenges from Reform UK. Six mayoral contests are scheduled in Croydon, Hackney, Lewisham, Newham, Tower Hamlets, and Watford, while mayoral elections in Cumbria, Cheshire & Warrington, Greater Essex, Norfolk and Suffolk, Hampshire and the Solent, and Sussex and Brighton have been postponed until 2027 or 2028. Council elections use the first-past-the-post system, and councils are responsible for local services such as housing, education, and waste management amid ongoing funding crises. In Scotland, all 129 Members of the Scottish Parliament (MSPs) are up for re-election, with voters casting two ballots\u2014one for a constituency MSP via first past the post and one for regional MSPs using proportional representation. The Scottish Parliament, established in 1999, governs areas like health, education, policing, and tax. In Wales, the 2026 Senedd election will expand the number of Members of the Senedd (MSs) from 60 to 96 across 16 new constituencies, with seats allocated proportionally. No party has ever won a majority in the Welsh Parliament, and the new system makes it highly unlikely that will change. The first minister is nominated by any MS and elected by the Senedd. Voter eligibility requires registration by 23:59 BST on 20 April 2026. In England, voters must be 18 and present valid photo ID (e.g., passport or driving licence) to vote in person; out-of-date ID is acceptable if the voter is still recognizable. Those without ID can apply for a free voter authority certificate by 17:00 BST on 28 April 2026. In Scotland and Wales, no ID is required for in-person voting. Postal and proxy votes must be renewed every three years, with deadlines at 17:00 BST on 21 April (postal) and 28 April (proxy) 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 09:32 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/simple-guide-may-elections-england-093720703.html)\n\n**Assam Assembly Election 2026: Key Dates, Phases, and Political Outlook**\nThe Assam Legislative Assembly elections for 2026 are expected to be held in the first week of April 2026, with voting likely between April 3 and April 7, based on a minimum 25-day gap between the election announcement and voting as mandated by the Election Commission. The current assembly's term ends in May 2026, necessitating the formation of a new government beforehand. According to sources, the election is likely to be held in a single phase, unlike the three-phase voting in 2021. Assam has 126 assembly seats, and a majority requires at least 64 seats. The BJP-led NDA alliance, currently in power under Chief Minister Himanta Biswa Sarma, aims to secure 90 to 100 seats in this election, marking its third consecutive term. To counter anti-incumbency sentiment, the BJP plans to revoke tickets from 25\u201330 sitting MLAs and replace them with 25\u201330 new faces. Prime Minister Narendra Modi is expected to hold 8\u201310 rallies in the state post-announcement to strengthen the election atmosphere. Major opposition parties include the Indian National Congress, Asom Gana Parishad, and All India United Democratic Front, indicating a multi-cornered contest. The Election Commission\u2019s official announcement is awaited, with the model code of conduct possibly coming into force in the first week of March 2026.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 08:57 AM\nSource:[OneIndia](https://hindi.oneindia.com/news/india/assam-election-2026-date-schedule-voting-phases-latest-update-assam-vidhan-sabha-chunav-tarikh-1498567.html)\n\n**National Assembly, INEC Set To Propose New Dates For 2027 Elections Amid Ramadan Fallout**\nThe National Assembly and the Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) have agreed to move the 2027 Nigerian presidential election from the originally scheduled February 20, 2027, to January 16, 2027, and the governorship elections from March 6, 2027, to January 30, 2027, according to multiple sources within the electoral body and federal legislature. This shift follows widespread criticism from Muslim groups and political stakeholders, including former Vice President Atiku Abubakar and former presidential aide Bashir Ahmad, who argued that holding elections during the 2027 Ramadan period\u2014projected to run from February 7 to March 8\u2014would suppress Muslim voter turnout. The initial February date sparked controversy, prompting emergency consultations. A senior INEC official confirmed that the new proposal emerged after several meetings between INEC and legislative leadership, though the plan remains subject to formal adoption. The National Assembly suspended its harmonisation of the Electoral Act (Amendment) Bill and called an emergency plenary session for Tuesday, February 17, 2026, to address the election dates. The session, described as crucial, will precede further debate on other contentious provisions of the bill. If approved, January 16, 2027, would be among the earliest presidential election dates in Nigeria\u2019s Fourth Republic.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 07:54 AM\nSource:[Sahara Reporters](https://saharareporters.com/2026/02/17/national-assembly-inec-set-propose-new-dates-2027-elections-amid-ramadan-fallout)\n\n**Assam: Chief Election Commissioner in State to take Stock of Poll Preparedness**\nChief Election Commissioner (CEC) Gyanesh Kumar, along with Election Commissioners Dr Sukhbir Singh Sandhu and Dr Vivek Joshi, arrived in Guwahati on February 17, 2026, for a three-day visit to assess election preparedness for the 2026 Assam Legislative Assembly elections. The full Election Commission of India (ECI) team held meetings with recognized national and regional political parties on February 18, followed by discussions with district commissioners, senior police officials, and other key state officials. On the same day, they met enforcement agencies, the state Chief Electoral Officer (CEO), the state police officer in charge, the CAPF nodal officer, the Assam Chief Secretary, and the Director General of Police (DGP). In the afternoon, the Commission addressed the media. The visit is part of the ECI\u2019s standard practice of conducting on-site assessments in poll-bound states, including security force deployment. The final photo electoral roll was published on February 10, 2026, with January 1, 2026, as the qualifying date for voter registration. The 2021 Assembly elections were held in three phases\u2014March 27, April 1, and April 6\u2014before Rongali Bihu, with vote counting on May 2.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 03:43 AM\nSource:[The Sentinel Newspaper](https://www.sentinelassam.com/topheadlines/assam-chief-election-commissioner-in-state-to-take-stock-of-poll-preparedness)\n\n**2027: N'Assembly eyes Jan 16 for presidential poll, suspends Electoral Bill harmonisation**\nThe Independent National Electoral Commission (INEC) and the National Assembly have reportedly agreed to move Nigeria's 2027 presidential election to January 16, 2027, and governorship elections to January 30, 2027, reversing the previously scheduled February 20 and March 6 dates. This decision follows strong criticism from Muslim groups and political stakeholders who argued that the original February 20 date coincided with Ramadan (February 7\u2013March 8, 2027), potentially suppressing voter participation. A senior INEC official confirmed the new dates, though a ranking senator cautioned the proposal remains subject to debate. The shift, if ratified, would compress campaign timelines and administrative preparations, marking a significant recalibration of the electoral calendar. The emergency plenary session of the National Assembly, reconvened on February 17, 2026, has suspended the harmonisation of the Electoral Act Amendment Bill to prioritize the election date review. The suspension reflects the prioritization of politically sensitive scheduling issues over technical legislative harmonisation. INEC acknowledged public concerns and stated it remains open to legislative intervention to ensure compliance with constitutional requirements while addressing inclusivity. The change could enhance Muslim voter turnout in northern states but may strain INEC\u2019s logistics and party mobilisation. Broader reforms, including expediting election petition resolution and ensuring elections occur at least 185 days before incumbent terms end, are also under consideration. The convergence of religious, technological, and constitutional factors has placed the National Assembly and INEC at the center of a pivotal electoral reform moment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 01:03 AM\nSource:[Punch Newspapers](https://punchng.com/)\n\n**Electoral Act Amendment: Falana, Utomi, Agbakoba, Bugaje, others for media rally today**\nThe Movement for Credible Elections (MCE), a coalition of civil society organisations and the labour movement, announced a media rally at the National Assembly in Abuja on February 17, 2026, to advocate for comprehensive electoral reforms.

According to MCE Media Coordinator James Ezema, the rally supports a public petition submitted to the National Assembly in January 2026 demanding electoral reforms. Head of MCE\u2019s national secretariat, Olawale Okunniyi, stated the rally is part of ongoing peaceful democratic engagement to ensure electoral laws reflect the will of the Nigerian people ahead of the 2027 general elections. He emphasized that credible elections are essential for strengthening democracy, ensuring political accountability, and restoring public confidence in governance.

The elections ended with Mario Mantovan winning by a narrow margin of seven votes (2,530 to 2,523). Initially, only three ballots were formally contested in official records, but Permunian\u2019s list expanded the challenge to include ballots marked with 'Thor' and 'Vigile'. The Veneto Regional Administrative Court (Tar) had previously rejected the appeal on October 2, 2024, ruling that the 'proof of resistance'\u2014the threshold proving irregularities could have altered the outcome\u2014was not met. Despite this, Permunian appealed to the Council of State, the highest administrative court in Italy, seeking annulment of the Tar\u2019s decision, a re-examination of contested ballots, and, in a subordinate request, a re-vote in certain sections. The Mantovan administration has expressed confidence in the judiciary but criticized the financial and administrative costs of prolonged uncertainty. The Council of State\u2019s decision will be final, with no further appeals allowed. If the appeal is dismissed, Mantovan\u2019s victory becomes definitive. A partial acceptance might acknowledge minor irregularities without changing the outcome. Only if a recount alters the vote tally could Mantovan\u2019s position be overturned. The most extreme outcome\u2014annulling the election and imposing a commissioner-led administration with new elections\u2014remains possible. Both Mantovan and Permunian have declared composure: Mantovan emphasized transparency and the waste of public resources, while Permunian defended the legal right to challenge results as a democratic duty, stating they will accept any verdict.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 05:00 AM\nSource:[La Voce Di Rovigo](https://www.polesine24.it/cronaca/2026/01/29/news/sindaco-e-il-giorno-del-giudizio-387286/)\n\n**Coahuila Unveils 2026 Electoral Calendar for State Legislature Elections**\nThe Instituto Electoral de Coahuila (IEC) has released the official calendar for the 2026 Local Ordinary Electoral Process, outlining key dates for the election of 25 local deputies to the state legislature.

Augustine revealed he first learned of the radar through social media, not official channels, and emphasized that while the system is intended for counter-narcotics surveillance and is non-offensive, the real issue lies in decision-making power: 'Tobago deserves more than information \u2014 we deserve a say.' He announced that a re-elected TPP government would initiate a referendum on Tobago's self-governance by mid-2026, potentially granting the island veto power over national security decisions affecting it. The radar has sparked public debate, with tourism stakeholders reporting declining bookings and critics highlighting a lack of transparency. Augustine dismissed claims that the radar makes Tobago a military target as 'fear-mongering,' reaffirming the island's neutral stance. The issue has become central to the 2026 THA election, framing it as a referendum on Tobago\u2019s political future.
