Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis:**

**WTO Official Sources:**
- **WTO Ethiopia accession page** (accessed Feb 2026): Primary resolution source. Shows Ethiopia still in accession process, not yet a member. High quality, authoritative, current.
- **WTO news (March 19, 2025)**: Reports 5th Working Party meeting, Ethiopia's target to join by MC14 (March 25-29, 2026). High quality official source, factual reporting with direct quotes from Minister Kassahun.
- **WTO news (September 26, 2025)**: Reports 6th Working Party meeting. Ethiopia answered >200 questions, submitted >50 laws, 33 draft commitments circulated. Chair requested bilateral negotiations finish "ideally before end-November" 2025, with next WP meeting "early 2026." High quality, authoritative, recent.

**Ethiopian Government Sources:**
- **EBC.et article** (date unclear, likely late 2025/early 2026): Dr. Eyob Tekalign reaffirms commitment to conclude accession by March 2026. Official government source but promotional in tone.
- **Birrmetrics** (September 29, 2025): Reports 6th WP meeting outcomes, mentions 7th WP meeting scheduled for January 2026. Mid-quality source, factual reporting.

**Opinion/Analysis Pieces:**
- **Capitalethiopia** (November 2, 2025): Opinion piece arguing *against* rushing to join by March 2026, citing IMF/World Bank concerns. This is advocacy journalism, not factual reporting of Ethiopia's actual timeline.
- **University World News** (August 20, 2025): Educational sector analysis. Mentions MC14 target date (March 25-29, 2026). Mid-quality source.

**Expert Analysis:**
- **Agent Report**: Comprehensive chronology through February 2026. High-quality synthesis of official WTO documents. Key facts: 6th WP meeting (Sep 26, 2025) upgraded Elements to full Draft WP Report; bilateral negotiations with 12 members "at an advanced stage"; 7th WP meeting planned for "early 2026"; substantial legislative work remains on TRIPS, SPS, trade remedies.

**Key Factual Timeline:**
- 5th WP: March 19, 2025
- 6th WP: September 26, 2025
- Target: MC14 in Yaoundé, March 25-29, 2026
- Resolution deadline: May 1, 2026
- Current date: February 17, 2026

(b) **Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **All WTO accessions (1995-present)**: 38 completed out of 60 applications over 30 years. Timeline varies wildly (3-4 years to 20+ years). Too broad.

2. **Recent LDC accessions**: 11 LDCs have acceded, most recently Comoros and Timor-Leste (2024). Ethiopia is an LDC. More relevant but still limited sample.

3. **Accessions with announced target dates at MC conferences**: This is most relevant. The agent report notes that at the 6th WP meeting, "several members flagged 'the significant amount of work remaining'" and stressed "substance should drive the process, not deadlines." This suggests target dates are aspirational.

4. **Ethiopia's specific accession trajectory**: Working Party established 2003; 5-year gap before 5th meeting (2020-2025); rapid acceleration in 2025 with two meetings; substantial progress but "significant work remaining" per members.

**Most suitable reference class**: Ethiopia's own recent trajectory combined with WTO procedural requirements for accession completion.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis:**

**Time remaining:** 73 days from today (Feb 17, 2026) to May 1, 2026.

**Required steps before May 1:**
1. Complete all bilateral market-access negotiations (12 still ongoing as of Sep 26, 2025)
2. Finalize Draft WP Report
3. Hold 7th (final) WP meeting to adopt WP Report
4. General Council approval of accession package
5. Ethiopia's domestic ratification
6. Deposit of instrument of accession

**Historical pattern for final stages:**
The agent report notes that even with political will and accelerated schedule, several procedural hurdles remain. The 7th WP meeting is scheduled for "early 2026" but no specific date announced as of Feb 17, 2026.

**MC14 timing:** March 25-29, 2026 is 36-40 days away. For Ethiopia to join *at* MC14, the General Council would need to approve the accession package before or during MC14. For resolution by May 1, there's an additional month.

(d) **Justification:**

**Positive factors:**
- Strong political commitment from highest levels (PM Abiy, multiple ministers)
- Accelerated pace in 2025 (two WP meetings after 5-year gap)
- Draft WP Report upgraded from "Elements" (major milestone)
- First bilateral protocol signed (China, Nov 2025)
- Technical parts of bilaterals completed with 6 members; 12 others "at advanced stage"
- Ethiopia submitted 130+ new laws by March 2025, 50+ more by September

**Negative factors:**
- **Procedural timeline is extremely tight**: 73 days to complete all steps
- **7th WP meeting not yet scheduled** as of Feb 17, 2026. "Early 2026" is vague; if it occurs in late February or March, insufficient time remains for General Council approval, domestic ratification, and accession before May 1
- **Substantial legislative work remains**: Agent report confirms TRIPS, SPS, trade remedies legislation still pending
- **WTO members emphasized "substance over deadlines"** at 6th WP meeting
- **12 bilateral negotiations still ongoing** as of September 2025; deadline to finish was "ideally before end-November" 2025, but no confirmation this was met
- **No precedent for completing accession in <6 months** from Draft WP Report stage
- **Domestic ratification timeline unclear**: Ethiopian parliamentary procedures not disclosed

**Critical gap:** The 7th WP meeting must occur, the package must be approved by General Council, and Ethiopia must complete domestic ratification—all within 73 days. Even if the 7th WP meeting occurs in late February, General Council approval typically requires weeks of preparation, and domestic ratification adds further delay.

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring considerations:**
- Ethiopia's stated target is MC14 (March 25-29), which is 36-40 days away—already extremely ambitious
- The question asks about May 1, giving an additional month beyond MC14
- However, no 7th WP meeting has been announced as of Feb 17, and this is a prerequisite

**Base rates:**
- Of countries announcing target MC dates for accession, what percentage meet them? The sources don't provide this directly, but the emphasis on "substance over deadlines" suggests targets are often missed.
- The fastest historical accessions (Kyrgyz Republic, Oman) took 3-4 years from Working Party establishment, not from Draft WP Report stage.

**Probability calibration:**
- If the 7th WP meeting were already scheduled for late February, probability might be 25-35%
- Without a scheduled 7th WP meeting as of Feb 17, and given the procedural steps required, probability drops significantly
- The agent report's assessment: "ambitious but still plausible path" if 7th WP meeting occurs in January-February 2026
- We are now in mid-February with no announced meeting date

**Upset rate consideration:**
In diplomatic/multilateral processes, announced timelines are frequently missed due to procedural complexity and consensus requirements. However, high-level political commitment can occasionally overcome obstacles.

Given:
- No 7th WP meeting scheduled yet (73 days to deadline)
- Substantial legislative work remaining
- Members' emphasis on substance over deadlines
- Procedural requirements (General Council approval, domestic ratification)
- But also strong political will and recent acceleration

I estimate a low but non-negligible probability.
