Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Primary WTO/Official Sources:**
1. **WTO news (19 Mar 2025)** - High quality, official. Ethiopia resumed accession negotiations with target of MC14 (March 2026). Factual: 5th Working Party meeting held, members emphasized "substance over deadlines."

2. **EBC/Ethiopian state media (Jan 2026)** - Moderate quality, state-controlled. Factual: Dr. Eyob confirmed March 2026 target, sixth WP meeting completed, bilateral negotiations ongoing with US. Opinion: Government commitment statements.

3. **ENA/Ethiopian News Agency (Dec 2025)** - Moderate quality, state media. Factual: Six rounds completed, 1,050+ questions addressed, 50+ pieces of legislation submitted. Opinion: Minister's optimism about 2026 timeline.

4. **Addisfortune (date unclear, likely late 2025)** - Moderate quality, independent Ethiopian press. Factual: Minister Kassahun confirmed March 2026 target, meeting with Ambassador Fisher Lamb. Opinion: "Renewed momentum" characterization.

5. **Capitalethiopia opinion piece (2 Nov 2025)** - Low-moderate quality, opinion piece arguing AGAINST rapid accession. Factual elements: March 2026 target exists, IMF/World Bank assessments cite institutional gaps. Opinion: Author argues accession is premature.

6. **Ethiopian Monitor (5 Nov 2025)** - Moderate quality. Factual: China bilateral market access deal signed early November 2025, sixth WP meeting held 26 Sep 2025, members encouraged to finalize bilaterals by end-November 2025, next WP meeting "could be scheduled for early 2026."

7. **WTO DG meeting (16 Feb 2025)** - High quality, official. Factual: 5th WP scheduled for 19 March 2025 after five-year pause, DG expressed support for conclusion by MC14.

**AskNews Articles (Feb 2026):**
8. **Ethiopia military deployment (17 Feb 2026)** - Factual but irrelevant to WTO accession. Documents renewed Tigray conflict risk.

9. **Russian officials on WTO paralysis (17 Feb 2026)** - Russian perspective claiming WTO is "practically paralyzed." Opinion from non-neutral source; limited relevance to Ethiopia's specific accession.

10. **China-Africa tariff deal (16-17 Feb 2026)** - Factual: China announces zero-tariff policy for 53 African countries effective 1 May 2026. Relevant context but doesn't directly affect WTO accession timeline.

11. **Brazil-Ethiopia bilateral protocol (3 Feb 2026, 30 Jan 2026)** - High quality, factual. Ethiopia and Brazil signed bilateral market access protocol, described as "significant step" but not final step.

12. **Kenya-Ethiopia trade regime (22 Dec 2025)** - Factual but tangential. Shows Ethiopia engaging in regional trade frameworks.

13. **Ethiopia-Russia cooperation discussion (22 Oct 2025)** - Factual: Ethiopia requested Russian support for WTO accession. Shows diplomatic outreach but no concrete progress indicator.

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Multiple sources (WTO official, Ethiopian government, bilateral partners) confirm March 2026 target but NO source indicates imminent completion.** The most recent factual update (Brazil bilateral signed 3 Feb 2026) shows negotiations still ongoing in February 2026.
- **Procedural requirements clearly established:** Per outside view analysis and WTO procedures, minimum steps remaining include: 7th Working Party meeting, final WP Report circulation/adoption, General Council approval, signature, domestic ratification, 30-day entry-into-force period. Historical minimum: ~6 months.
- **No 7th Working Party meeting scheduled:** Ethiopian Monitor (Nov 2025) stated next WP "could be scheduled for early 2026" - conditional language. No subsequent source confirms a scheduled meeting.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Brazil bilateral signed 3 Feb 2026:** Shows progress but also indicates negotiations were still ongoing just 2 weeks ago. If bilaterals were wrapping up in early February, this suggests the process is not on an ultra-accelerated track.
- **China bilateral signed Nov 2025:** Earlier completion suggests some momentum, but the fact that Brazil bilateral came 3 months later indicates staggered, not synchronized, completion.
- **Ethiopian Monitor (Nov 2025) stated members "encouraged to finalize remaining bilateral negotiations by end-November":** This deadline appears to have been missed (Brazil signed in February).

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Government statements of commitment:** Ethiopian officials consistently express determination to meet March 2026 target, but these are aspirational statements, not procedural confirmations.
- **Renewed military tensions (17 Feb 2026):** Could distract government attention but is speculative regarding direct impact on WTO process.
- **Russian claims of WTO paralysis:** Opinion from interested party; doesn't affect Ethiopia's specific accession mechanics.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Current timeframe:** 74 days (17 Feb 2026 to 1 May 2026) = 2.4 months

**If halved to 37 days (1.2 months):** Probability would drop to ~1%. Procedurally impossible to complete all remaining steps.

**If doubled to 148 days (4.8 months):** Probability might rise to ~15-20%. This would allow bare minimum time for: one WP meeting in March, rapid General Council approval in April, signature/ratification in May, entry-into-force by late June. Still very tight but within realm of historical precedent for final stages.

**Critical observation:** We are now 17 Feb 2026. MC14 is scheduled for March 2026 (exact dates unclear but typically mid-to-late month). If Ethiopia were to accede at MC14, the 7th Working Party meeting would need to occur within the next 2-3 weeks, followed by immediate General Council approval. No source indicates such a meeting is scheduled.

**(d) Justification:**

**Status quo outcome:** Ethiopia remains in accession negotiations, not yet a member.

**Factors supporting low probability (2-5%):**
1. **No scheduled 7th Working Party meeting:** Most decisive factor. Without this meeting occurring by early March at latest, accession by 1 May is procedurally impossible.
2. **Bilateral negotiations still ongoing in February:** Brazil deal signed 3 Feb shows process not yet complete.
3. **Historical precedent:** Zero cases of completion from Ethiopia's stage in <3 months.
4. **30-day entry-into-force requirement:** Even if all other steps completed by 1 April, membership wouldn't begin until 1 May at earliest.

**Factors that could support higher probability (5-10%):**
1. **MC14 political window:** Ministerial Conferences sometimes enable accelerated decisions. If Ethiopia's accession were prioritized as a symbolic achievement, procedural steps could be compressed.
2. **Multiple bilaterals completed:** China (Nov 2025), Brazil (Feb 2026) show progress. If remaining bilaterals are minor, the package could be nearly ready.
3. **Government statements of March 2026 target:** While aspirational, these indicate serious intent and resource allocation.

**Calibration reasoning:**
The outside view base rate of 4% was based on historical precedent showing zero completions from this stage in <3 months. Current evidence does NOT provide strong reasons to shift significantly from this base rate:
- No evidence of accelerated timeline (7th WP not scheduled)
- Evidence of ongoing work (Brazil bilateral in February)
- No indication of imminent General Council approval

However, the MC14 political window and recent bilateral completions provide weak-to-moderate evidence for a small upward adjustment. The fact that we're now in mid-February with no 7th WP scheduled is actually negative evidence, suggesting the March target is slipping.

**Inside view calibration:** 3-5% range. I'll center at 4%, matching the outside view, as current information neither strongly confirms nor refutes the base rate scenario.

**Probability Calibration:**

Starting from outside view base rate of 4%, I assess:
- Strong negative evidence (no 7th WP scheduled, ongoing bilaterals in Feb): -1%
- Weak positive evidence (MC14 political window, government commitment): +1%
- Net adjustment: 0%

Final calibrated probability: **4%**

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Ethiopia complete all WTO accession requirements and become an official member by 1 May 2026? (74 days from now)

2. **Base rate:** Outside view established 4% based on historical reference class of accessions from similar procedural stage.

3. **Consistency check:** "4 out of 100 times, Ethiopia completes all remaining accession steps and becomes a WTO member by 1 May 2026." This aligns with the assessment that it's highly unlikely but not impossible if MC14 enables extraordinary acceleration.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - No 7th Working Party meeting scheduled as of 17 Feb 2026 (factually verified via absence in all recent sources)
   - Brazil bilateral signed 3 Feb 2026, indicating negotiations ongoing just 2 weeks ago (verified via multiple sources)
   - Historical precedent: zero accessions completed from this stage in <3 months (verified via WTO data)
   - MC14 in March 2026 provides potential political acceleration window (verified via WTO calendar)
   - 30-day entry-into-force requirement creates hard procedural floor (verified via WTO accession rules)

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Ethiopia and key WTO members have secretly agreed to an ultra-compressed timeline with a 7th WP meeting scheduled for late February/early March that hasn't been publicly announced. If this occurred and all subsequent steps were pre-negotiated, accession by 1 May becomes feasible. This scenario would raise probability to ~15-25%.

6. **Status quo check:** The situation is relatively stable with slow procedural progress. No dramatic changes in the past month. Status quo (non-membership) is highly likely to persist through 1 May. Current volatility is low, supporting confidence in the low probability assessment.

**Probability: 4%**
