Analysis:
1) Resolution framing (what counts)
This resolves Yes if the WTO’s official Ethiopia accession page shows Ethiopia has completed accession and is a WTO member, with an accession date/equivalent statement, at any time from 2026-02-17 (opening) through 2026-05-01 (deadline).

(a) Source analysis (what we learned; quality; date)
High-reliability / primary
- WTO news releases (Feb/Mar/Sep 2025): Primary institutional reporting on accession milestones (Working Party meetings, draft report status, members’ cautions about “substance over deadlines”). Dated 2025 (historical context), but still the most credible indicators of procedural readiness and bottlenecks.
- WTO accession page (resolution source): Implied current status as of question open (2026-02-17) is “not yet a member.” Highest reliability but (per prompt) we don’t have a fresh quoted snapshot beyond “no completion indicated” in the outside-view summary.

Medium reliability (official domestic messaging; may be optimistic/strategic)
- EBC (Ethiopian Broadcasting Corporation): Reports Ethiopia reaffirmed a goal to conclude accession by March 2026 after talks with USTR official. Good for “intent and political push,” weaker for “will all members sign off + procedural completion by May 1.”
- ENA (Ethiopian News Agency, Dec 11 2025): Government negotiator cites progress (rounds completed, questions answered) and target of 2026. Useful progress signal; not an independent procedural confirmation.
- Addis Fortune (local business press): Reports ministry push to complete by March 2026; helpful but still second-order relative to WTO documentation.

Medium/uncertain reliability (single-outlet reporting on specific bilateral steps)
- Ethiopian Monitor (Nov 5 2025): Reports bilateral market-access deal with China concluded. Plausible and consistent with the accession process; still not the same as “all key bilaterals done + WP report adopted.”
- Brasil 247 / UrduPoint Arabic (Jan 30 / Feb 3 2026): Reports Ethiopia–Brazil market-access protocol signed (bilateral concluded). Adds a concrete incremental milestone; outlet quality is mixed, but the claim is specific and time-stamped.

Low reliability for forecasting / opinion
- Capital Ethiopia (Nov 2 2025): Opinion arguing Ethiopia should slow down. Useful as a “domestic political-economy resistance exists” indicator; not strong evidence of actual accession outcome.

New “inside-view” negative context (credible; not directly about WTO but affects feasibility)
- AFP via Paris Match (Feb 17 2026): Reports major troop deployments and renewed conflict risk around Tigray. High-quality conflict reporting; this can plausibly slow legislation, bargaining focus, and diplomatic bandwidth in the final sprint.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence (large directional pull)
- Structural/procedural constraint: With only ~73 days to May 1, Ethiopia would need (i) final Working Party completion and adoption of the WP report + schedules, (ii) approval at/around MC14 (late March), and (iii) rapid domestic acceptance so that the 30-day clock yields membership before May 1. This is a tight, multi-step critical path with several veto points. (Strong, structural.)

Moderate evidence (meaningful but not decisive)
- Multiple official Ethiopian statements (EBC, ENA, Addis Fortune) reiterating a March 2026 target: indicates high political will and active negotiation tempo. (Moderate; intent ≠ completion.)
- Concrete bilateral progress: China deal (Nov 2025) plus Brazil deal (Jan/Feb 2026 reporting) suggests bilaterals are moving, not stalled. (Moderate; still leaves unknown number of remaining bilaterals and unresolved rule-alignment issues.)
- WTO’s prior reporting that members stressed “substance over deadlines” and that significant technical work remained (TRIPS/SPS/TBT, etc. per outside-view synthesis). (Moderate-to-strong: indicates other members may resist rushing.)

Weak evidence (small adjustments)
- Russia-linked articles calling WTO “paralyzed/dead”: mostly political rhetoric, not predictive for Ethiopia’s accession mechanics. (Weak.)
- General trade-cooperation commentary pieces: not Ethiopia-accession-specific. (Weak.)

Net: The strongest signal remains the procedural/time bottleneck; pro-accession signals are real but mostly “effort” rather than “completion of all gates.”

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left: ~73 days (from 2026-02-17 to 2026-05-01).
- If timeframe were halved (~36 days): probability would drop sharply (few accessions can clear final WP + approval + ratification + 30-day wait inside ~5 weeks), likely to the low single digits.
- If timeframe were doubled (~146 days, to ~mid-July 2026): probability would rise materially because the same MC14 approval could still lead to membership after slower ratification, or a slipped Working Party meeting could still conclude in time; I’d expect something like ~20–30% in that longer window (still far from certain, but no longer “thread-the-needle”).

(d) Justification (inside view vs outside view)
Outside view base rate (given): 8%.

What shifts upward vs 8%
- Additional bilateral completion signals since the outside-view writeup: Brazil protocol (Jan/Feb 2026 reporting) plus continued US engagement (EBC) slightly increase the odds that “endgame diplomacy” is underway and that some remaining bilaterals could close quickly.
- Repeated “March 2026” target from multiple Ethiopian-government-adjacent sources suggests Ethiopia is actively trying to use MC14 as the convergence point.

What shifts downward vs 8%
- New, credible escalation risk in the north (AFP/Paris Match, Feb 17 2026) increases the chance that attention, legislative bandwidth, and external confidence are impaired exactly during the narrow completion window.

Why I’m not moving far from the outside view
- Even granting genuine momentum, the May 1 cutoff is unforgiving: Ethiopia must not only “wrap negotiations by March,” but also have WTO approvals and domestic acceptance happen fast enough that the 30-day membership-effective clock still lands before May 1. That’s a compounded timing risk, and we still lack any clear, high-reliability indication (e.g., WTO scheduling/announcement) that a final Working Party meeting has already occurred or is imminently set in a way consistent with this timetable.

Probability calibration
- Start from outside view: 8%
- Upward adjustment for evidence of continued bilateral closures + high-level push: +3 pp
- Downward adjustment for elevated conflict risk during the sprint: −1 pp
Inside-view probability: 10%

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: “From 2026-02-17 through 2026-05-01, will the WTO’s Ethiopia accession page show Ethiopia completed accession and is a WTO member?”
2) Outside view base rate: 8%
3) Consistency line: “10 out of 100 times, Ethiopia becomes a WTO member (per the WTO accession page) by May 1, 2026.”
4) Key evidence (most important):
- Tight critical path + 30-day post-acceptance timing makes May 1 hard even if MC14 succeeds.
- Multiple official Ethiopian statements targeting conclusion by March 2026 (political will).
- Bilateral market-access protocols reported with China (Nov 2025) and Brazil (Jan/Feb 2026) show progress.
- WTO members previously emphasized “substance over deadlines” (risk of slippage).
- AFP reports renewed Tigray conflict risk (disruption risk).
5) Blind spot (what could make this look silly): A near-immediate final Working Party meeting plus a coordinated “package close” where most remaining bilaterals were already done quietly, enabling MC14 approval and very rapid domestic acceptance.
6) Status quo outcome: Not a WTO member by May 1, 2026 remains the default; short horizon favors No.

Probability: 10%
