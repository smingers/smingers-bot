Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (summary + quality)
1. **WTO Ethiopia accession page (a1_ethiopia_e.htm)**  
   - **What it says (facts):** Working Party (WP) established 2003; Ethiopia is still in the accession process; latest publicly reflected milestone is the **5th WP meeting (March 2025)**; no statement that Ethiopia is a WTO member.  
   - **Quality:** **Highest** (primary source for status).  
   - **Date:** Page content as summarized appears current through at least early 2026, but the extract may be incomplete; still, absence of “member” status is meaningful.

2. **WTO news release (Mar 19, 2025) – “Ethiopia resumes accession… target of WTO membership by MC14”**  
   - **What it says (facts):** Negotiations resumed after a 5-year pause; Ethiopia tabled revised goods/services offers; next steps and deadlines for comments; stated political target to join by **MC14**.  
   - **What it says (opinions/intent):** Ethiopia’s minister expresses ambition to finalize “in the next several months”; WTO officials caution substance over deadlines.  
   - **Quality:** **Very high** (official WTO communication).  
   - **Date:** March 2025 (somewhat dated, but relevant as a baseline for pace).

3. **CapitalEthiopia opinion piece (Nov 2, 2025)**  
   - **What it says (facts/claims):** Mentions Ethiopia “driving to conclude … by March 2026,” but largely argues against rushing.  
   - **Quality:** **Low-to-medium** for forecasting completion; it’s mainly normative argumentation with selective references.

4. **Newbusinessethiopia article by Xiangchen Zhang (general accession statistics)**  
   - **What it says (facts):** Over 30 years: **60 applied, 38 completed**; accessions can take 3–4 years at fastest, nearly 20 at slowest; LDC accessions exist but are limited in count.  
   - **Quality:** **Medium-high** for **reference-class/base rates**, not Ethiopia-specific.

5. **WTO general accessions page (wto.org/accessions)**  
   - **What it says (facts):** Process overview; unanimity among WTO members required; not Ethiopia-specific.  
   - **Quality:** **High** for process constraints, **low** for timing.

6. **EBC (state-linked Ethiopian media) article about talks with USTR**  
   - **What it says (facts/claims):** Ethiopia reiterates commitment to conclude by **March 2026**; references a **Sixth WP meeting**; says “final stretch.”  
   - **Quality:** **Medium**—useful for stated intent and claimed milestones, but not a primary WTO confirmation.

7. **University World News (Aug 2025) on MC14 timing**  
   - **What it says (facts/claims):** MC14 scheduled **March 25–29, 2026**; Ethiopia aims to join by then.  
   - **Quality:** **Medium**; plausible on dates, but not an official MC14 communiqué. Use mainly as corroboration.

8. **Birr Metrics (Sep 29, 2025) on negotiations and milestones**  
   - **What it says (facts/claims):** Reports Sixth WP in Sept 2025; draft WP report upgraded; 7th WP scheduled Jan 2026; bilaterals advanced; US sticking points on tariffs.  
   - **Quality:** **Medium**—could be accurate, but not an official WTO record.

9. **Agent report (mix of official WTO news + secondary local reporting)**  
   - **What it says (facts, where supported by WTO releases):** Confirms via WTO news that **6th WP meeting occurred Sept 26, 2025**, draft WP report upgraded, bilaterals progressing, “substance not deadlines” caution.  
   - **What it adds (uncertain):** Some document symbols/status and granular legislative gaps; useful but partly inference.  
   - **Quality:** **Medium-high overall**, with **high confidence** on elements explicitly tied to WTO news releases.

**Bottom line from sources for outside view:** Ethiopia is *not yet a member*; there is an *ambitious target around MC14 (late March 2026)*, but WTO communications emphasize the possibility of slippage.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside-view baselines)
Plausible reference classes:

1. **All WTO accession applicants since 1995 (60 applicants; 38 completed)**  
   - **Pros:** Clean global base rate that accession is achievable.  
   - **Cons:** Not time-bounded; not conditional on being “late stage”; not useful for a ~2.5 month horizon.

2. **Late-stage accessions aiming to conclude at a Ministerial Conference (MC)**  
   - **Pros:** Better match to Ethiopia’s stated goal (MC14).  
   - **Cons:** Small sample; timing from “late stage” to formal membership varies widely.

3. **LDC accessions (e.g., Comoros, Timor-Leste) and time from approval to membership**  
   - **Pros:** Ethiopia is (or is treated as) an LDC-like case in accession terms; captures a key mechanical constraint: **approval ≠ membership immediately**.  
   - **Cons:** Still small-N; country-specific ratification speed differs.

**Most suitable reference class for this question:**  
A **two-step reference-class approach**:  
- (i) probability that an applicant *gets WTO members to approve the accession package by the target ministerial or shortly before*, and  
- (ii) conditional probability that the applicant *completes domestic ratification and becomes a member within the short remaining window*.

This matches the resolution criterion (“be a WTO member by May 1, 2026”), which depends heavily on the typical **post-approval lag**.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Today:** 2026-02-17  
- **Resolution deadline:** 2026-05-01  
- **Time remaining:** ~**73 days** (~2.4 months).

Historical pattern relevant to the timeframe: WTO accessions, especially for LDCs, often have a **non-trivial lag** between (a) political/ministerial approval of the accession terms and (b) **actual entry into force** as a member after domestic ratification and deposit (often **months**, not weeks). A <2.5 month window is therefore structurally tight even if negotiations are near completion.

---

### (d) Justification (outside view synthesis)
From an outside view, the key is that the event requires **two gates** within ~73 days:

1. **Gate 1: WTO-side completion** (working party finalization, consensus, formal approval at MC14 or General Council). Even late-stage processes can slip due to a single major member’s outstanding bilateral demands, unresolved legislative alignment (TRIPS/SPS/TBT/trade remedies), or procedural scheduling.

2. **Gate 2: Ethiopia-side rapid ratification and entry-into-force**. Even if approval happens at **MC14 (late March 2026)**, Ethiopia would likely have **~30 days** (or less) to (i) ratify domestically and (ii) complete WTO deposit formalities and (iii) clear any waiting period before membership is effective—this is *possible* but, by base rates, **uncommon**.

So even granting that Ethiopia is “close,” the outside view says: **“close” is not the same as “member within 73 days.”** The short deadline (May 1) heavily penalizes the probability.

Outside view calibration:

- A rough tether from sources: **38 completed / 60 applied** (≈63%) is the long-run “eventually joins” base rate, but this is not time-appropriate.  
- For the **next ~2.5 months**, the base rate among “advanced accessions” becoming full members is much lower because:
  - most accessions take years, and
  - even after approval, membership typically takes additional time.
- Upset rate: high sensitivity to single-point failures (one bilateral negotiation stalls; domestic legislative timetable slips; procedural delays). That argues against assigning a high probability in such a short window.

Given these constraints, I calibrate the outside-view probability into the **high single digits to low teens**.

Outside View Prediction:
**9.7%**
