Analysis:
1. Paraphrased question and criteria  
“Between now (17 Feb 2026) and 1 May 2026, will the WTO website say that Ethiopia is a WTO member?”  Official accession-status page is the adjudication source; Ethiopia must have completed every legal step and the entry-into-force date must fall on or before 1 May 2026.

2. Outside-view base rate (established earlier)  
Long-run probability that any “late-stage” applicant becomes a member within the next 2½ months was set at 9.7 %.

3. Source analysis (chronological, factual vs. opinion, quality)  
• WTO accession page – 2026-02-17 capture: still “observer”, 6th WP meeting noted; no member status.  (Primary, high quality, factual)  
• WTO news 19 Mar 2025 – Ethiopia resumed talks, target MC14.  (High, factual + stated intent)  
• EBC 15 Feb 2026 – Dr Eyob tells USTR Ethiopia aims to finish by Mar 2026.  (State media, factual about meeting; intent statement = opinion)  
• Addis Fortune 06 Jan 2026 – Minister Kassahun: “working to complete by March”. (Medium quality; factual quotes)  
• Ethiopian Monitor 05 Nov 2025 – China market-access deal done. (Medium; factual)  
• Brasil 247 / UrduPoint 30 Jan & 03 Feb 2026 – Brazil market-access deal done. (Medium; factual)  
• AFP via Paris-Match 17 Feb 2026 – Heavy troop build-up in Tigray. (Independent, factual; relevance = domestic distraction)  
• Capital Ethiopia 02 Nov 2025 – Opinion piece urging pause. (Low for facts, high for potential domestic resistance)  
No source reports that the Working Party has concluded or that a General Council date has been fixed to adopt the Accession Package.

4. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
– Structural rule: after WTO members approve the Protocol, membership enters into force 30 days after Ethiopia deposits its ratification (Art XII.2). Hard to compress.  
– Historical pattern: recent accessions (Timor-Leste, Comoros) took 4-6 months between WP completion and membership date.  
Moderate evidence  
– Ethiopia has finished some bilateral deals (China, Brazil) indicating momentum.  
– MC14 (25-29 Mar 2026) offers a political window for approval.  
– Ethiopia’s parliament is dominated by the ruling party, so ratification could be rushed.  
Weak evidence  
– Public statements of intent (“finish by March”) – aspirational.  
– Domestic security flare-ups could delay legislative focus, but magnitude uncertain.

5. Timeframe analysis  
73 days remain.  If the window were doubled (to October 2026) probability would rise dramatically (>50 %); halved (to early April) probability collapses (<2 %).  The mechanical 30-day post-deposit clock makes the last few days of March the real deadline for WTO approval.

6. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Chain of required events before 1 May 2026:  
a) Working Party finalises report and schedules of commitments (must occur in the next ~10 days).  Based on past pacing and unresolved bilaterals with the US/EU/India, I assign 20 %.  
b) General Council (or MC14) adopts the package by consensus no later than ~1 April 2026.  Conditional probability 80 %.  
c) Ethiopian parliament ratifies and deposits instrument with WTO Secretariat within ≤1 day.  Ethiopia can move fast, but even the 2019 AfCFTA ratification took 10 days; assign 60 %.  
d) Mandatory 30-day waiting period means deposit must occur by 1 April for 1 May membership.  Probability, given c), 50 %.  

Multiplying: 0.20 × 0.80 × 0.60 × 0.50 ≈ 4.8 %.  
Adding a small tail for an earlier-than-expected General Council meeting (late March approval, late-March deposit with a waiver) pushes the estimate to roughly 6 %.

7. Most influential evidence (≤20 words each)  
• WTO rule: 30-day gap between deposit and legal membership.  
• No confirmation that Working Party has concluded.  
• Only some bilateral deals (China, Brazil) finished; US/EU status unknown.  
• MC14 begins 25 Mar 2026 – tight calendar.  
• New Tigray troop build-up may sap political bandwidth.

8. Blind-spot scenario  
Unpublicised intensive negotiations wrap up next week; WTO holds a special General Council mid-March; Ethiopia’s cabinet issues emergency decree shortcutting ratification – membership 29 April 2026.  Would add ~8-10 % to probability.

9. Status-quo bias check  
Status quo = “still observer” on 1 May. Short horizon + procedural rigidity favour the status quo; small nudge downward applied.

Probability calibration
Given the outside-view 9.7 % and the inside-view chain-of-events model (≈5 %), I converge on a rounded 6 % chance that Ethiopia will have become a WTO member on or before 1 May 2026.

Checklist:
• Clear alignment with resolution criteria ✔  
• Outside-view base rate anchored ✔  
• “6 out of 100 times Ethiopia would be a WTO member by 1 May 2026” – coherent ✔  
• Key evidence items listed and vetted ✔  
• Blind-spot scenario acknowledged ✔  
• Status-quo favouring re-checked ✔
