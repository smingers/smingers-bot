Analysis:  
(a) Source analysis  
1. WTO Ethiopia accession page (updated to Feb 2026). Fact-heavy, official. Confirms Ethiopia is still “in accession”, last recorded Working-Party meeting March 2025. No accession date given.  
2. WTO news release 19 Mar 2025 (5th WP). Official. States political target “join by MC14 (March 2026)”, but also members’ caveat that “substance, not deadlines, must drive the process”.  
3. CapitalEthiopia opinion piece 2 Nov 2025. Commentary; factual element is the government’s public target of March 2026. Quality moderate, opinion-heavy.  
4. Birr Metrics 29 Sep 2025. Business press. Factual: 6th WP took place, Draft WP Report was authorised, 7th WP pencilled in for Jan 2026, some bilaterals still open.  
5. EBC 12 Jan 2026 (meeting with USTR). State-media; factual: Ethiopia still hopes to finish by March 2026, sixth WP outcomes reviewed; bilateral talks ongoing.  
6. University World News Aug 2025. Secondary. Gives same target date, little procedural detail.  
7. Generic WTO accessions pages & NewBusinessEthiopia piece. Provide long-run statistics on accession timelines.  
8. Agent report (compiled from restricted WTO and press material). Synthesises procedural steps still missing: (a) 7th WP not yet held, (b) outstanding legislation (TRIPS, SPS, trade remedies), (c) accession protocol still requires General Council approval, domestic ratification and 30-day entry-into-force. Reliably sourced to WTO communiqués; good factual quality.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
1. “All accessions since 1995” (38 cases).  
   – Average ≈1.3 accessions/year.  
   – 22 economies currently negotiating → baseline chance that any one accedes in a given calendar year ≈1.3/22 ≈ 6%.  
   – For a 0.20-year window (74 days) that is ≈ 1.2%.  
   Suitability: gives neutral base rate but ignores where each candidate sits in the pipeline.  

2. “Accessions that had held 5-6 WP meetings but had not yet had a final WP meeting.”  Timor-Leste, Comoros, Seychelles, Kazakhstan, etc.  Historically, once the Draft WP Report is promoted to “full draft”, the median time to final WP approval is roughly 9 months; time from that approval to official membership a further 4-6 months.  No historical case completed the remaining steps in <4 months.  
   Suitability: closer procedural match, still objective.

We adopt reference class 2 because Ethiopia is at exactly that stage (full Draft WP Report but final WP not yet convened).

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Today is 17 Feb 2026; resolution date 1 May 2026 → 74 days (≈2.4 months).  
Historical pattern: minimum observed elapsed time from “no final WP yet” to official membership has been ~6 months (Kyrgyz Republic 1998, Oman 2000).  Typical range 9-15 months.  Therefore, on outside-view grounds, the required compression (all remaining negotiations + formalities + 30-day entry-into-force) within 2.4 months would be unprecedented.

(d) Justification  
• Status-quo outcome if nothing changes: Ethiopia remains a non-member.  
• Outstanding work (per Agent report & WTO releases): at least one more WP meeting, completion of several bilateral market-access deals, circulation and adoption of final WP Report, General-Council vote, signature, domestic ratification, deposit of instrument → +30 days.  Even under best-case sequencing, this chain is highly unlikely to fit inside 74 days.  
• Expert/market signals: no WTO communiqué since Sep 2025 sets a firm WP date; press pieces in Jan 2026 still speak of “ongoing” bilaterals.  No indication of imminent finalisation.  
• Historical upset rate: 0/38 accessions have leapt from Ethiopia’s current stage to membership inside three months.  Allowing for a tail-risk of an ultra-fast, politically driven package at MC14, we still cap base-rate probability in the low single digits.

Outside view calibration:  
Raw base-rate (reference class 2) for completion within 3 months ≈0%.  To reflect uncertainty in the historical record, the potential for extraordinary political acceleration at MC14, and the small sample size, inflate by a factor of 2-3.  This yields 2–3%.  Add a further one percentage point for generic “black-swan” latitude.  Calibrated outside-view probability ≈4%.

Outside-View Prediction: 4%
