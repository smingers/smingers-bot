Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (quality, date, facts vs. opinion)
1. WTO news-items (Mar-25, Sep-25, Feb-25) – primary, highly reliable.  Show Ethiopia at 5th & 6th Working-Party (WP) meetings; no final WP, not yet a member.  Facts only.
2. WTO accession page (consulted 17 Feb 26) – definitive; Ethiopia still “in accession process.”  Facts only.
3. Addis Fortune 02 Feb 26 & ENA 11 Dec 25 – state-owned/ semi-official Ethiopian outlets repeating the government goal of joining by Mar-26; little independent verification.  Mostly statements of intent (opinion).
4. Brasil 247 / UrduPoint 30 Jan-03 Feb 26 – factual signing of bilateral market-access protocol with Brazil.  Reliable for the narrow fact.
5. AFP / Paris-Match 17 Feb 26 – credible wire service reporting heavy troop mobilisations in Tigray.  Fact.
6. Capital Ethiopia op-eds (Nov-25) – private newspaper; analytical opinion criticising rush.  Opinion.
7. Russian commentary that “WTO is dead” – peripheral to Ethiopia’s accession; no bearing on resolution.  Ignore.
Overall: only WTO documents and the Brazil protocol give hard evidence of concrete procedural progress; all other Ethiopian/government statements remain aspirational.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence
• Structural rule: after a protocol is signed the applicant must deposit its instrument of acceptance; membership enters 30 days later – hard procedural floor (difficult to change).
• No 7th (final) WP meeting scheduled/published as of 17 Feb 26 – implies earliest possible adoption is MC14 late-Mar-26.
Moderate evidence
• Bilateral protocols with China (Nov-25) and Brazil (Feb-26) show momentum; unknown how many remain (EU, US, India likely outstanding).
• Government and WTO DG repeatedly cite the March-26 target – indicates political will but not binding.
Weak evidence
• Domestic conflict flare-ups (Tigray) could distract parliament – plausible but speculative within 2-month window.
• Critic op-eds arguing for delay – reflect dissent, not mechanics.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Time left: 74 days until 01 May 26.
Halved (37 days): virtually zero chance; even the 30-day entry-into-force rule alone kills it.
Doubled (~5 months): probability would rise appreciably (to perhaps 15-20 %) because mechanical steps could fit.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base rate (draft-WP-report stage to full membership inside 3 months) = 5 %.
Downward pressures (–):
• Mechanical timeline: need final WP adoption (not yet scheduled), protocol signature (earliest MC14, 25-29 Mar), domestic ratification & deposit all by 31 Mar for 30-day clock → extremely compressed; no precedent (< 61 days) for such speed (strong evidence, –3 pp).
• Unknown number of outstanding bilaterals; EU & US usually the slowest (moderate, –1 pp).

Upward pressures (+):
• Brazil and China bilaterals closed; Secretariat “upgrading” WP draft – indicates near-finish (+2 pp).
• Strong political desire to proclaim success at MC14; Ethiopia’s parliament can pass bills rapidly under one-party dominance (+1 pp).
Net: 5 % – 4 % + 3 % ≈ 4 %.

Inside-view probability: 4 %.

Probability calibration
If status quo momentum continues, Ethiopia would still be short of the ratification stage by 1 May.  Only an extraordinary, record-breaking procedural sprint delivers a “Yes.”  I judge that to occur about 4 times in 100.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrased question: “Will Ethiopia become a WTO member on or before 1 May 2026, per the WTO accession page?”
2. Outside-view base rate: 5 %.
3. Consistency line: “4 out of 100 times, Ethiopia would manage to clear every step and be listed as a WTO member by 1 May 2026.”
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):
   • No final WP meeting scheduled; 74-day window.
   • 30-day rule from deposit to membership – hard procedural minimum.
   • Bilaterals with China, Brazil done; others unknown.
   • Precedent: fastest end-game accession 61 days.
5. Blind-spot: Ethiopia pre-negotiated parliamentary approval and deposits instrument the same day protocol is signed at MC14, shaving timeline to 30 days.
6. Status-quo bias check: current status “not a member” plus short window favours “No.”

Probability: 4%
