## Summary of "Why Ethiopia Must Pause Its Rush to Join the WTO"

**Source:** Capitalethiopia  
**Date:** November 02, 2025

### Key Arguments and Facts:

**Timeline Reference:**
- Ethiopia is driving to conclude WTO accession by **March 2026**

**Core Argument:**
The article argues that Ethiopia's rush to join the WTO by March 2026 is a strategic error that will impose binding legal commitments before the country has adequate productive capacity, administrative infrastructure, and fiscal flexibility to manage the transition.

**Ethiopia's Current Economic Profile:**
- Manufacturing value added remains low relative to successful late-developing countries
- Lacks absorptive capacity to withstand rapid import penetration
- Customs modernization, competition enforcement, financial supervision, and social-protection delivery remain "works in progress"
- Faces persistent fiscal strains, foreign-exchange pressures, and public-debt vulnerabilities (per recent IMF assessments)
- These constraints limit the government's ability to finance large-scale adjustment programs that rapid liberalization would require

**IMF and World Bank Assessments:**
- IMF diagnostics note Ethiopia has made "meaningful progress on stabilization" but remains exposed to currency pressures, parallel market premia, and public-debt vulnerabilities
- IMF country report documents governance, financial-sector, and public-administration shortfalls
- IMF repeatedly emphasizes the need to sequence liberalization with institutional strengthening
- World Bank's large Development Policy Operation provides financial support but conditions disbursement on policy benchmarks related to public-sector governance, financial stability, and trade competitiveness
- Both institutions deliver a consistent message: "macro and institutional readiness must precede or be tightly sequenced with binding liberalization commitments"

**Risks of Premature Accession:**
- WTO commitments would become enforceable constraints on tariffs, subsidies, procurement preferences, and services regulation
- Would constrain targeted subsidies, local-content requirements, and support for state-owned enterprises—tools the article describes as "central to many catching-up strategies"
- Could precipitate plant closures and job losses in nascent industries
- Ongoing debt restructuring and external-financing gaps narrow fiscal room to compensate losers from trade shocks

**Comparative Cases (as interpreted by the article):**
- **Vietnam:** Accession succeeded because it followed decades of preparatory reforms; accession was "consolidating rather than initiating"
- **Ghana and Kenya:** Illustrate costs of liberalization that outpaced institutional capacity—textile and light-manufacturing sectors contracted under import pressure

**Global Trade Context:**
- The article claims the multilateral trade landscape has fragmented
- Argues that "incremental benefits of immediate WTO accession are therefore smaller than they were in earlier decades, while accession's constraints remain large"

**Disclaimer:** This is an opinion piece arguing against rapid WTO accession. The article does not cite specific statistics for many claims and represents the author's interpretation of IMF/World Bank positions rather than direct quotes from those institutions.

## Summary of WTO Accessions Page

This article provides general information about the WTO accession process rather than specific details about Ethiopia's accession status.

### Key Facts:

1. **Accession Requirements**: Any state or customs territory with full autonomy in trade policies may become a WTO member, provided all existing WTO members agree on the terms.

2. **Process**: Accession occurs through:
   - Establishment of a working party of WTO members
   - A process of negotiations
   - All members join through negotiations resulting in a balance of rights and obligations

3. **Current Status**: The article mentions "there are currently economies seeking to join the WTO" but does not specify the number or names of these economies.

4. **Tools and Resources**: The WTO provides:
   - An Accessions Intelligence Portal with information on ongoing and completed accessions since 1995
   - An Accessions Transparency Tool Box (ATTB) including a handbook, annual reports, and an Accession Commitments Database (ACDB)

5. **"Trade for Peace" Initiative**: Launched in December 2017 at the 11th WTO Ministerial Conference in Buenos Aires, this initiative targets fragile and conflict-affected (FCA) countries (approximately half of acceding countries), aiming to use WTO accession as a pathway to economic growth and development.

### Note:
This appears to be a general informational page about WTO accessions rather than Ethiopia-specific content. It does not contain specific information about Ethiopia's accession timeline, progress, or likelihood of completion by May 1, 2026.

Query: Find official WTO working-party documents and statements from 2023-2026 on Ethiopia’s accession progress, including meeting dates, draft schedules, and target of joining by MC14, plus analysis of remaining legislative steps in Ethiopia.
1. Chronology of Working Party activity and official statements (2023-2026)

• 5 Dec 2024 – 11 Dec 2024 - Geneva visit of Ethiopia’s high-level “Steering Committee on Accession.” During the visit, WTO Deputy Director-General Zhang and Minister Kassahun Gofe Balami agreed on an “accession roadmap … envisaged for 2026” and preparation for a 5th Working Party (WP) meeting in early-2025 (WTO news24_e/acc_11dec24_e.htm).  
• 19 Mar 2025 – 5th WP meeting (the first since January 2020). Ethiopia tabled:  
   – Revised goods offer (bound rates below LDC agricultural benchmark).  
   – Revised services offer (finance, communications, transport, education, tourism).  
   – Legislative action plan and responses to outstanding member questions.  
   – Target stated by Minister Kassahun: “finalize the accession process … and join the WTO family at the 14th Ministerial Conference (MC14) in Yaoundé, March 2026.”  
   Members were invited to submit written comments by 16 Apr so that the Secretariat could update the Elements of the Draft WP Report, with a tentative aim to hold a 6th WP meeting “before the summer break” 2025 (WTO news25_e/acc_19mar25_e.htm; Ethioembassy.ca summary).

• 19 Mar 2025 – A WTO room document, RD/ACC/12 (restricted), circulated “action plans for the implementation of the TBT, SPS and TRIPS Agreements” (SPSIMS document list). This signals that Ethiopia has begun detailing domestic legal work still outstanding in the three most demanding rule-making areas.

• 26 Sep 2025 – 6th WP meeting. Key take-aways (WTO news25_e/acc_26sep25_e.htm):  
   – Ethiopia had answered >200 additional questions and submitted >50 pieces of legislation since March.  
   – 33 draft accession commitments circulated.  
   – Technical parts of bilateral market-access negotiations concluded with six members; negotiations with 12 others “at an advanced stage”.  
   – Chair asked members to finish bilaterals “ideally before end-November” 2025; Secretariat instructed to upgrade the Elements of a Draft WP Report to a full Draft WP Report.  
   – Next WP meeting pencilled in for “early 2026”.

• 5 Nov 2025 – Ethiopia signed a Goods-and-Services market-access protocol with China, its first full bilateral deal; Minister Kassahun called the accession process “in a decisive phase” and reiterated the MC14 completion target (Ethiopianmonitor.com, 5 Nov 2025).

• WTO accession page (a1_ethiopia_e.htm, accessed Feb 2026) records that the WP “met for the fifth time in March 2025” and is chaired by Amb. Rebecca Fisher-Lamb (UK). The page will be updated when the Draft WP Report is adopted and the accession is legally completed.

2. Information on draft schedules and negotiating documents

• Draft Goods Schedule: circulated to members before the 5th WP meeting (revised offer, lower agricultural bound rates) – official reference number not public, but cited in WTO news25_e/acc_19mar25_e.htm.

• Draft Services Schedule: also revised and broadened (finance, telecoms, transport, education, tourism) – idem.

• Elements of a Draft WP Report (sometimes numbered WT/ACC/ETH/—/Draft) – updated after 16 Apr 2025 comments, then converted to full Draft Report after the 6th WP meeting per WTO news25_e/acc_26sep25_e.htm.

• Action plans for TBT, SPS and TRIPS implementation – RD/ACC/12, 19 Mar 2025 (restricted), listed in SPSIMS.

Because accession documents remain “restricted” until the WP Report is adopted (WTO de-restriction rule on a1_ethiopia_e.htm), none of the detailed schedules or the Draft Report are yet publicly available. Their existence and status are, however, confirmed in the news releases.

3. Remaining legislative and policy steps inside Ethiopia

Based on the questions raised by members and Ethiopia’s own action plans, the still-outstanding domestic tasks are:

a. Intellectual-property regime – Ethiopia must adopt TRIPS-consistent patent, trademark, copyright and enforcement laws. A separate action plan (RD/ACC/12) was tabled, indicating work yet to be completed.

b. SPS / TBT infrastructure – Ethiopia is preparing laws and implementing regulations to make its sanitary-and-phytosanitary and technical-standards systems WTO-compatible. The checklist documents WT/ACC/ETH/7/Rev.1 (SPS issues, 19 Mar 2025) show that further regulatory alignment is pending.

c. Trade remedies – Ethiopia has no anti-dumping, countervailing-duty or safeguard legislation in force and therefore must enact primary laws and implementing regulations.

d. State-owned-enterprise disciplines – Ethiopia is drafting rules (and revising the Investment Holdings legislation) to ensure SOEs operate on commercial terms and comply with WTO subsidy disciplines (Ethioembassy.ca, 19 Mar 2025).

e. Services-sector liberalisation – banking, insurance, telecoms and logistics laws must be passed in forms that reflect the draft services commitments. Further steps include issuing subsidiary regulations and licensing frameworks, particularly for foreign-equity ceilings and prudential supervision.

f. Customs valuation and import-licensing – Members posed detailed questions (≈130 at the 5th WP) about Ethiopia’s customs valuation methods, licensing procedures and forex controls. Amendments to the Customs Proclamation and the Import/Export Licensing Proclamation are envisaged.

g. Publication and transparency – Ethiopia committed to adopt a Gazette-type official journal and electronic portal for prompt publication of trade laws, a standard post-accession obligation.

The government reported the issuance of “130 new laws to reduce WTO-inconsistent trade barriers” by March 2025 and another 50 by September 2025, but members continue to request updates, signalling that some enactments and implementing regulations remain in draft form.

4. Assessment of Ethiopia’s timeline versus MC14 target (March 2026)

Positive factors:  
• High-level political ownership – Prime Minister Abiy met DG Okonjo-Iweala in Feb 2025; multiple ministers sit on the Steering Committee.  
• Accelerated WP schedule – two meetings held in 2025 after a five-year gap, with a pledge to hold another in “early 2026”.  
• Bilateral progress – first full protocol with China; “technical parts” finished with five additional members. If the remaining dozen bilaterals close by end-2025, only legal scrubbing would remain.  
• Secretariat upgrading Draft WP Report – a prerequisite for concluding package.

Risks/uncertainties:  
• Restricted documents indicate that substantial legislative work on TRIPS, SPS and trade remedies is pending; Ethiopia may need transition periods but still must table final texts before accession.  
• The 6th WP communiqué stresses that “substance should drive the process, not deadlines,” and several members flagged “the significant amount of work remaining” (news25_e/acc_26sep25_e.htm).  
• No date has yet been fixed for the Final WP meeting; without that, the accession protocol cannot be transmitted to the General Council/MC14.  
• Ethiopia must ratify the accession package domestically after signature; timelines for parliamentary approval are not yet disclosed.

Overall, Ethiopia remains on an ambitious but still plausible path to seek General Council approval in early-2026 and formal membership by MC14, if the final WP meeting can be convened by January-February 2026 and if residual legislative packages (especially in IP and SPS) are enacted and notified in 2025.

5. Information gaps

• Public text or symbol numbers of Ethiopia’s revised goods/services offers and the Draft WP Report are not yet available because of WTO document restrictions.  
• Status of each bilateral negotiation (partners, tariff and services concessions) is only partially disclosed; only the China agreement is public.  
• Detailed legislative timetable inside Ethiopia (which bills are still in Council of Ministers or Parliament) is not released.  
• A firm date for the 7th (presumably final) WP meeting has not been announced as of February 2026.

If finer-grained analysis is required, the following would be useful once accessible: the full Draft WP Report, Ethiopia’s schedules of concessions (Goods and Services), and the legislative action-plan annexes, together with Ethiopian parliamentary calendars for 2025-2026.</Agent_report>
