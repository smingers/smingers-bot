The primary source for resolution is the WTO Ethiopia accession page:\r\nhttps://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/acc_e/a1_ethiopia_e.htm\r\nIf the accession page is unclear or temporarily unavailable, resolvers may resolve the question using Metaculus\u2019 \u201ccredible sources\u201d definition if needed.",
