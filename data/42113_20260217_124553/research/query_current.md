Analysis:
The key to answering the forecast is whether Ethiopia’s WTO accession—negotiations, Working Party report, protocol signing, domestic ratification, and formal deposit with the WTO—has been completed by 1 May 2026. Therefore we need the very latest coverage (late-2025 through Feb 2026) from the WTO itself, Ethiopian government statements, and reputable economic or diplomatic news sources. Indicators to watch: (1) WTO Working Party meeting outcomes, (2) signature of the Protocol of Accession, (3) ratification by Ethiopia’s Parliament, and (4) the WTO website switching Ethiopia’s status to “Member since …”. Searches should combine “Ethiopia”, “WTO”, and verbs like “accession”, “joins”, “membership”, with recent dates to catch any February 2026 developments.
