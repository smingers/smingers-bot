Analysis:
To judge Ethiopia’s likelihood of becoming a WTO member by 1 May 2026 we need a clear picture of its accession progress to date. Key context includes: • the chronology and outcomes of Working Party meetings, particularly the 2023 restart and any 2024-25 sessions; • the target of joining by the 14th WTO Ministerial Conference (MC14, Feb 2026); • domestic legislative reforms Ethiopia must finish (tariff schedules, services offers, laws on SPS/TBT, IP, investment, state-owned enterprises); • political or security events that could speed up or derail the process (e.g., peace talks, debt issues, US or EU trade relations). Historical documents from the WTO, Ethiopian government, and news coverage will reveal how close Ethiopia is to meeting the technical conditions and whether any accession protocol has been drafted or initialed.
