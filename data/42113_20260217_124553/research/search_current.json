Ethiopia Must Pause Its Rush to Join the WTO\"\n\n**Source:** Capitalethiopia  \n**Date:** November 02, 2025\n\n## Key Arguments and Facts:\n\n### Timeline and Context\n- Ethiopia is targeting to conclude WTO accession by **March 2026**\n- The article argues this timeline is too rushed and poses strategic risks\n\n### Ethiopia's Current Economic Conditions\n- **Manufacturing capacity:** Manufacturing value added remains low relative to successful late-developing countries, lacking absorptive capacity to withstand rapid import penetration\n- **Institutional capacity:** Customs modernization, competition enforcement, financial supervision, and social-protection delivery remain \"works in progress\"\n- **Fiscal constraints:** Recent IMF assessments emphasize persistent fiscal strains, foreign-exchange pressures, and public-debt vulnerabilities that limit countercyclical policy and government's ability to finance large-scale adjustment programs\n\n### IMF and World Bank Assessments (cited in article)\n- IMF diagnostics note Ethiopia has made progress on stabilization but remains exposed to currency pressures, parallel market premia, and public-debt vulnerabilities\n- IMF country report documents governance, financial-sector, and public-administration shortfalls\n- World Bank's large Development Policy Operation provides financial support linked to policy benchmarks on public-sector governance, financial stability, and trade competitiveness\n- **Both institutions' consistent message:** Macro and institutional readiness must precede or be tightly sequenced with binding liberalization commitments\n\n### Risks of Premature Accession (according to article)\n- WTO membership creates binding legal commitments on tariffs, services, state-owned enterprises, intellectual property, and procurement\n- These constraints limit policy tools for industrial upgrading (targeted subsidies, procurement preferences, local-content requirements)\n- Risk of \"premature deindustrialization\" and concentrated adjustment costs\n- Could threaten \"fragile political compact underpinning recent reforms\"\n- Conditional financing from IMF/World Bank could be jeopardized if accession accelerates import competition and raises fiscal costs\n\n### Comparative Cases Mentioned\n- **Vietnam:** Accession succeeded because it followed decades of preparatory reforms; accession was \"consolidating rather than initiating\"\n- **Ghana and Kenya:** Cited as cautionary examples where liberalization outpaced institutional and fiscal capacity, resulting in textile and light-manufacturing sector contractions\n\n### Global Trade Context\n- The article argues the multilateral trade landscape has fragmented, with mega-regional agreements and bilateral investment treaties now governing \"the most lucrative supply-chain nodes\"\n- Claims incremental benefits of immediate WTO accession are smaller than in earlier decades\n\n**Note:** This is an opinion piece arguing against rapid WTO accession. The factual claims about IMF/World Bank assessments and Ethiopia's economic conditions are presented as supporting evidence for the author's position but should be verified against primary sources.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://ethiopianmonitor.com/2025/11/05/ethiopia-seals-market-access-deal-with-china-advancing-wto-accession-bid/\">\n# Summary of Article: Ethiopia Seals Market Access Deal with China, Advancing WTO Accession Bid\n\n**Date:** November 05, 2025  \n**Source:** Ethiopianmonitor\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n### Bilateral Agreement with China\n- Ethiopia signed a bilateral market access protocol with China at WTO headquarters in Geneva on Tuesday (early November 2025)\n- The agreement was signed by Ethiopia's Permanent Representative Tsegab Kebebew and China's Permanent Representative Li Yongjie\n- This concludes bilateral market access negotiations on trade in goods and services between Ethiopia and China within the WTO accession framework\n\n### Timeline and Target\n- Ethiopia is pushing to complete bilateral and multilateral negotiations and **join the WTO in March 2026**\n- The accession process has reached \"a decisive phase\" according to Minister Kassahun Gofe\n\n### Recent Progress (as of September-November 2025)\n- Sixth meeting of the Working Party on Ethiopia's accession held on September 26, 2025\n- Ethiopia responded to over 200 questions from WTO members\n- Submitted over 50 pieces of legislation\n- Tabled 33 draft commitments for consideration by members\n\n### Domestic Reforms\nMinister Kassahun Gofe highlighted key reforms undertaken since the fifth round meeting in March, including:\n- Further liberalization of banking and foreign exchange (forex) sectors\n- Easing requirements for foreign investors\n- Increasing the role of the private sector in the economy\n- These reforms are part of Ethiopia's Home-Grown Economic Reform Agenda\n\n### Next Steps\n- WTO members were encouraged to finalize remaining bilateral market access negotiations and sign agreements before end-November (2025)\n- Members were invited to submit written questions and comments by October 24\n- WTO Secretariat was mandated to \"upgrade\" the Elements of a Draft Working Party Report to a Draft Report\n- Next Working Party meeting could be scheduled for early 2026, depending on progress\n\n### Additional Context\n- Ethiopia began trading in goods under the African Continental Free Trade Agreement framework in October 2025 (one month before this article)\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.wto.org/english/news_e/news25_e/dgno_16feb25_e.htm\">\n# Summary of Article: \"DG Okonjo-Iweala meets Ethiopia's PM, Steering Committee to accelerate WTO accession\"\n\n**Source:** WTO\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n1. **High-Level Meeting:** WTO Director-General Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala met with Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed Ali during her stay in the Ethiopian capital, discussing Ethiopia's WTO accession process.\n\n2. **Economic Reforms Discussed:** The meeting covered Ethiopia's economic reforms, including:\n   -

This buildup raises fears of a renewed conflict in the region, which emerged from a two-year war ending in November 2022. The war, one of the deadliest in recent years, caused at least 600,000 deaths according to the African Union, though experts believe the figure may be higher. Although a peace agreement ended the conflict, instability persists: clashes occurred in January 2026 between federal forces and Tigrayan troops, and flights to and from Tigray were suspended for several days. A security source stated, 'The ENDF (Ethiopian National Defense Force) are surrounding Tigray,' while a local source confirmed, 'We are seeing massive mobilization of both federal and Tigrayan forces.' The same local source warned, 'If the international community does not pressure the conflicting parties to resolve their dispute through dialogue, the risk of war increases.' The Ethiopian federal army declined to respond to AFP\u2019s inquiries. Ethiopia, Africa\u2019s second-most populous country with about 130 million people, has tense relations with neighboring Eritrea. Addis Ababa accuses Asmara of supplying weapons to rebels and of having aligned with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). On February 10, 2026, Volker T\u00fcrk, the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, urged the parties in Tigray to take urgent measures for 'de-escalation' before it is too late. Ethiopia and Eritrea previously fought a large-scale war from May 1998 to June 2000 over control of border areas.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 09:45 AM\nSource:[Paris Match](https://www.parismatch.com/actu/international/ethiopie-letat-federal-deploie-massivement-des-troupes-dans-le-nord-faisant-craindre-une-reprise-des-combats-264631)\n\n**Overchuk Claims WTO Activities Have Nearly Stopped**\nVice Prime Minister of the Russian Federation Alexei Overchuk stated that the activities of the World Trade Organization (WTO) have nearly halted in recent years, according to reports by TASS. He emphasized that outdated regulations no longer fulfill their intended functions amid global economic uncertainty. Overchuk noted that emerging technologies require new resources, leading to the formation of new international supply chains, which in turn drives countries and corporations to seek control over critical mineral extraction and new transport-logistics routes. This view aligns with previous comments by Alexander Shokhin, Chairman of the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs (RSP\u041f), who argued that the WTO is failing to meet current challenges and may cease to exist, likening the situation to the anecdote about prematurely declaring someone dead.

Speaking at the 'Architecture of the Future: Russian Business on Key Multilateral Platforms' forum, Overchuk stated that Western countries are engaging in unfair competition, and that sanctions, tariffs, and non-tariff barriers now play a dominant role in international economic relations. The WTO, established on January 1, 1995, regulates approximately 98% of global trade in goods and services and is headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. As of the article's publication, 162 countries, including Russia since 2012, are members of the organization.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 08:19 AM\nSource:[\u041a\u043e\u043c\u043c\u0435\u0440\u0441\u0430\u043d\u0442.ru](https://www.kommersant.ru/doc/8441129)\n\n**China announces start date to tariff-free trade deal with Africa | The Citizen**\nChinese President Xi Jinping announced that a 100% tariff-free trade agreement between China and Africa will take effect on 1 May 2026. The agreement will extend comprehensive zero-tariff treatment to 53 African countries with diplomatic ties to China, excluding Eswatini, which maintains diplomatic relations with Taiwan\u2014a position Beijing opposes. In a message to the 39th African Union Summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, Xi expressed optimism about the agreement, stating it will 'unlock new opportunities for Africa's development and the joint pursuit of modernisation' and enhance African exports to China through upgraded 'green lanes.' He commended South Africa for leading the signing of the Framework Agreement on Economic Partnership for Shared Development (Caepa) in Beijing on 6 February, with Minister Parks Tau and China\u2019s Minister of Commerce Wang Wentao as signatories. Xi emphasized that China and South Africa will aim to conclude an early harvest deal by the end of March 2026, ensuring South Africa\u2019s long-term, stable zero-tariff access under WTO rules. The China-Africa tariff-free arrangement is a temporary preferential measure, designed to accommodate procedural delays and negotiation challenges in African countries. It is guided by the principles of sincerity, results, amity, and good faith, and does not conflict with ongoing early harvest negotiations under the Caepa framework. Xi highlighted the rising influence of the Global South amid global transformations, praising the African Union for advancing continental integration and strengthening Africa\u2019s global standing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 03:20 AM\nSource:[The Citizen](https://www.citizen.co.za/news/china-africa-tariff-free-trade-deal-start-date/)\n\n**Ethiopia to Host African Leaders Summit Focused on Tourism, Trade, Visa Policies and Regional Cooperation for Economic Growth - Travel And Tour World**\nAfrican leaders will convene in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, later in 2026 for a high-profile summit focused on advancing tourism, trade, visa policies, and regional cooperation to drive economic growth.

United Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres welcomed the move during the 39th African Union Summit in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, and urged all developed and economically capable nations to follow suit. Guterres stated that Africa, facing severe economic challenges, should not be disadvantaged by restrictive trade policies and tariffs, emphasizing the need for a more open trade environment for African goods. The policy expansion builds on China\u2019s prior zero-tariff measures for certain products from several of the world\u2019s least developed African countries. China also plans to advance the signing of economic partnership agreements and expand African product access to China through measures like upgrading the 'green channel'. This move comes amid concerns over U.S. President Trump\u2019s protectionist policies, which imposed tariffs of 10% to 30% on several African nations after his return to the White House in January 2025, prompting some African countries to seek alternative trade partnerships.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 04:29 AM\nSource:[ETtoday\u65b0\u805e\u96f2](https://www.ettoday.net/news/20260216/3119645.htm)\n\n**Integration, Crisis Management, and Political Stability: Key Priorities of the African Union in Ethiopia**\nThe 39th Ordinary Summit of the African Union (AU) concluded on Sunday, February 15, 2026, in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, focusing on three key priorities: political and economic integration, crisis management, and political stability. AU Commission President Mahmoud Ali Youssouf emphasized that the turbulent international order and external interference significantly impact Africa, calling for accelerated integration and stronger institutional commitment. Angola\u2019s President Jo\u0101o Louren\u00e7o reaffirmed the need to implement the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA), launched in 2019, while stressing that progress depends on peace and stability in conflict zones such as Sudan, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), and Somalia. Italy\u2019s Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni and UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres attended and supported AU efforts, with Guterres advocating for African nations to benefit first and fully from their critical minerals through a fair and sustainable system. On crisis management, Youssouf called for AU-led mediation in the DRC conflict, particularly after a peace agreement was signed in Washington in December 2025, urging the AU to take the lead rather than relying on external actors. On political stability, Youssouf declared zero tolerance for unconstitutional changes of government, citing the Sahel region\u2019s recent coups in Niger, Burkina Faso, and Mali, which formed a regional alliance and distanced themselves from the ECOWAS. He stressed the need for AU solidarity and support for Sahel nations. Climate change was also highlighted as a major challenge, with Youssouf asserting that industrialized, polluting nations must financially support African adaptation efforts due to the continent\u2019s developmental status. Despite identifying urgent needs, the summit did not produce concrete solutions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 02:04 AM\nSource:[France 24](https://www.france24.com/es/%C3%A1frica/20260216-integraci%C3%B3n-gesti%C3%B3n-de-crisis-y-estabilidad-pol%C3%ADtica-los-ejes-de-la-uni%C3%B3n-africana-en-etiop%C3%ADa)\n\n**In an uncertain trade landscape, cooperation still delivers**\nDespite ongoing trade tensions and policy volatility in 2025 and 2026, global trade and economic growth showed notable resilience. Supply chains continued to adapt, and markets remained interconnected, though smaller and more vulnerable economies faced greater pressure. Two key developments underscore that international cooperation remains possible and impactful. First, the United States renewed the African Growth and Opportunity Act (AGOA) and the HOPE and HELP arrangements for Haiti, providing predictable market access for 32 sub-Saharan African countries\u201421 of them least developed\u2014supporting export sectors in textiles, agriculture, and light manufacturing. These programs, though representing a small share of U.S. imports, are critical for employment, foreign exchange earnings, and fiscal stability in beneficiary economies. Second, the European Union and MERCOSUR (Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Paraguay, Uruguay) concluded a long-negotiated Association Agreement, demonstrating that structured trade frameworks remain attainable even amid geopolitical contestation. For developing economies, consistent rules and credible expectations are essential for diversification, value addition, and investment. Discretionary or case-specific policies increase compliance costs and deepen uncertainty, disproportionately affecting vulnerable nations. As WTO members prepare to meet in March 2026 to update the global trade rulebook, reform is emphasized not as mere defense of existing systems, but as adaptation to contemporary realities such as digital trade, evolving supply chains, and modern production patterns. The system\u2019s coherence depends on timely, flexible reform to maintain confidence. Fragmentation is a risk, not an inevitability, and outcomes hinge on whether interdependence is managed through credible, negotiated frameworks rather than unilateral actions. Predictability enables long-term planning, investment, and development. Trade policy, though technical, shapes development trajectories and social cohesion. The future of the global trading system is not predetermined\u2014governments retain the capacity to strengthen, update, and uphold rules that are credible, adaptable, and consistently applied.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 11:17 PM\nSource:[Vanguard](https://www.vanguardngr.com/2026/02/in-an-uncertain-trade-landscape-cooperation-still-delivers/)\n\n**UN Secretary-General Praises China's Zero-Tariff Initiative for African Nations**\nUnited Nations Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres praised China's decision to implement zero tariffs on all 53 African countries with which it has diplomatic relations, effective May 1, 2026.

Shokhin emphasized that decisive measures are required to revive the WTO. He also noted a similar lack of effectiveness in the G20, despite equal voting rights between industrialized nations like G7 members and BRICS states, which has failed to produce consensus on key global issues. Additionally, Maxim Orekhin, Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration of Russia, stated on November 22, 2025, that the WTO is unable to overcome trade restrictions, particularly those imposed by economic sanctions, and that fundamental changes in principles and approaches are necessary to restore its functionality.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 02:39 PM\nSource:[Izvestia.ru](https://iz.ru/2043296/shokhin-nazval-vto-nakhodiashcheisia-v-sostoianii-klinicheskoi-smerti-izi)\n\n**Brazil and Ethiopia Sign Access to Market Protocol Ahead of WTO Membership**\nBrazil and Ethiopia signed a Bilateral Access to Market Protocol in Geneva, the headquarters of the World Trade Organization (WTO), marking the conclusion of their bilateral negotiations and representing a significant step toward Ethiopia's accession to the WTO.

The agreement, formalized in Addis Ababa and signed by Ethiopia's Minister of Commerce and Regional Integration, Kassahun Gofe, and Kenya's State Secretary for Investments, Trade, and Industry, Lee Kinyanjui, follows consensus reached during talks in Mombasa in April 2025. The initiative aims to formalize and secure local trade, particularly benefiting small-scale traders operating daily across the border. By clarifying rules, reducing bureaucratic hurdles, and establishing a common framework, the two governments seek to reduce informality in cross-border trade, enhance access to essential goods, increase incomes, curb illicit trade, and strengthen peace and cooperation.

The bilateral meetings were with the Prime Minister of Ethiopia, the Prime Minister of Vietnam, the President of Angola (who also chairs the African Union), the President of Finland, the Director General of the World Trade Organization (WTO), and the Secretary-General of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD). Ethiopia expressed interest in Indonesia\u2019s agricultural sector, particularly palm oil, while Angola showed interest in expanding cooperation in plantation commodities such as coffee and cocoa. Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Arrmanatha Natsir stated that the talks focused on strengthening economic cooperation. The Johannesburg G20 Summit marked the first time the summit was hosted on African soil and concluded the consecutive presidencies of the Global South, which began with Indonesia in 2022, followed by India, Brazil, and South Africa.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 23, 2025 04:56 AM\nSource:[Antara News](https://jatim.antaranews.com/berita/1006049/vp-gibran-joins-mikta-bilateral-talks-at-g20-summit-sidelines)\n\n**Why Ethiopia Must Pause Its Rush to Join the WTO - Capital Newspaper**\nEthiopia risks significant economic and political costs by rushing to complete World Trade Organization (WTO) accession by March 2026. The article argues that finalizing accession under current conditions\u2014without sufficient productive capacity, administrative strength, or fiscal space\u2014will lock Ethiopia into binding legal commitments on tariffs, services, state-owned enterprises, intellectual property, and procurement. These commitments could accelerate premature deindustrialization, reduce policy flexibility for industrial upgrading, and concentrate adjustment costs where institutional and fiscal weaknesses are greatest. The IMF and World Bank emphasize that macroeconomic stability and institutional readiness must precede or be tightly sequenced with liberalization. Recent diagnostics highlight persistent fiscal strains, foreign-exchange pressures, public-debt vulnerabilities, and underdeveloped customs, competition enforcement, financial supervision, and social-protection systems. Without financed adjustment programs, retraining, or compensatory transfers, trade liberalization could trigger plant closures, job losses, and political backlash. Comparative cases like Vietnam show successful accession followed decades of preparatory reforms, while Ghana and Kenya experienced contraction in manufacturing sectors due to liberalization outpacing institutional capacity. The global trade landscape has fragmented, with mega-regional agreements and digital trade rules increasingly governing high-value supply chains, reducing the marginal benefit of immediate WTO accession. The article recommends reframing accession as the capstone of a disciplined readiness process, contingent on verifiable benchmarks in customs modernization, competition law enforcement, financial supervision, and social protection\u2014aligned with IMF and World Bank disbursement conditions. It calls for multi-year transition windows, enforceable safeguard clauses, independent technical review of accession offers, sector-level impact assessments, and a coordinated financing envelope for adjustment. Delaying accession to ensure readiness is politically viable when framed as a time-bound, transparent strategy, whereas haste risks transferring concentrated losses to vulnerable communities and sectors, undermining the reform compact. Final assessment: WTO accession should be the finish line of a deliberate readiness race, not the starting pistol for an uncertain sprint.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 02, 2025 07:50 AM\nSource:[capitalethiopia.com](https://capitalethiopia.com/2025/11/02/why-ethiopia-must-pause-its-rush-to-join-the-wto/)\n\n**Ethiopia Seeks Closer Ties with Russia in Trade and Peaceful Nuclear Energy**\nEthiopia has requested Russia's support in its efforts to join the World Trade Organization (WTO), aiming to access new markets and strengthen its global economic position. The country, Africa's second-most populous nation, has faced repeated setbacks in WTO accession talks due to internal challenges such as political and regional conflicts, as well as international concerns over its trade policies. In parallel, Ethiopia has discussed with Moscow the potential for cooperation in peaceful nuclear energy, including the construction of nuclear reactors, to address its growing electricity needs and reduce reliance on hydropower\u2014particularly vulnerable to recurring droughts. Russia is seen as a suitable partner due to its extensive experience in exporting nuclear technology and prior projects with African nations like Egypt. This strategic outreach reflects Ethiopia\u2019s broader effort to balance its international relations between the West and Eastern powers, especially amid tensions with Western countries over human rights. Economically, WTO membership could provide a clearer legal framework for international trade and attract foreign investment. Politically, seeking Russian support signals a shift toward diversifying diplomatic ties. The potential nuclear partnership could transform Ethiopia\u2019s energy sector and reduce its dependence on dams. According to Aljazeera, the developments were published on October 22, 2025.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 11:55 AM\nSource:[Aljazeera](https://www.aljazeera.net/ebusiness/2025/10/22/%d8%a5%d8%ab%d9%8a%d9%88%d8%a8%d9%8a%d8%a7-%d8%aa%d8%b3%d8%b9%d9%89-%d9%84%d8%af%d8%b9%d9%85-%d8%b1%d9%88%d8%b3%d9%8a%d8%a7-%d9%81%d9%8a-%d8%a7%d9%84%d8%a7%d9%86%d8%b6%d9%85%d8%a7%d9%85)\n\n**Balancing Risks - Capital Newspaper**\nEthiopia is on the verge of joining the World Trade Organization (WTO), a major economic milestone, following high-level participation in critical negotiations ahead of the upcoming WTO Ministerial Conference. Membership offers significant benefits, including access to global markets, increased foreign investment, and enhanced credibility through integration into a transparent, rules-based multilateral system. Economic models project a potential over 10% increase in real GDP, greater industrialization, and expanded participation in global trade networks. WTO membership would also grant Ethiopia access to dispute resolution mechanisms and technical assistance for building institutional capacity in trade governance. However, challenges are substantial: Ethiopia\u2019s largely agrarian economy faces vulnerability to global market shocks, and the removal of protective tariffs and subsidies\u2014historically used to support infant industries\u2014could undermine local development and lead to job losses. The global trade environment remains asymmetric, with developed nations maintaining agricultural subsidies and protectionist policies that disadvantage Ethiopia\u2019s agricultural sector, which employs the majority of its population. Implementing WTO commitments requires extensive domestic reforms, including modernizing customs, overhauling legislation, and strengthening administrative capacity\u2014challenges compounded by Ethiopia\u2019s complex political landscape, ethnic tensions, and governance issues. Bilateral negotiations on market access, tariffs, and services are technically complex and time-consuming, with delays risking investment uncertainty. Socially, market liberalization may disrupt rural livelihoods and increase inequality without robust social safety nets. To mitigate risks, Ethiopia must pursue a balanced accession strategy involving transitional periods for sensitive sectors, investment in comparative advantage sectors, inclusive stakeholder engagement, and active participation in shaping WTO rules. International partnerships and donor support can aid capacity building and adjustment programs. The success of WTO accession hinges on strategic flexibility, political resolve, and inclusive governance to ensure sustainable and equitable economic transformation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 07:54 AM\nSource:[capitalethiopia.com](https://capitalethiopia.com/2025/10/05/balancing-risks/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
