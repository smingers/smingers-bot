The article does not cite specific statistics for many claims and represents the author's interpretation of IMF/World Bank positions rather than direct quotes from those institutions.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://newbusinessethiopia.com/nbe-blog/thirty-years-of-wto-accessions/\">\n# Summary of Article from Newbusinessethiopia\n\n**Author:** Xiangchen Zhang\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **WTO Membership Growth:**\n   - WTO established January 1, 1995 with 128 original members\n   - Current membership: 166 members\n   - WTO members now account for over 98% of world trade (up from 87% in 1995)\n   - Over 70% of this trade is still conducted under WTO's most-favoured-nation (MFN) principles\n\n2. **Accession Applications:**\n   - Over past 30 years: 60 countries and customs territories have applied for WTO accession\n   - 38 have completed the process\n   - 22 economies are currently at various stages of negotiating accession\n\n3. **Accession Timeline Variations:**\n   - Fastest: Kyrgyz Republic and Oman (3-4 years; joined 1998 and 2000 respectively)\n   - Slowest: Kazakhstan and Seychelles (nearly two decades; both joined 2015)\n\n4. **LDC Accessions:**\n   - 11 LDC accessions to date\n   - First LDCs: Cambodia and Nepal (2004)\n   - Most recent: Comoros and Timor-Leste (2024)\n   - Three LDCs graduated from LDC status after WTO membership: Cabo Verde (2008), Samoa (2014), Vanuatu (2020)\n   - Several more LDCs expected to graduate before end of this decade (Lao PDR, Nepal, Cambodia)\n\n5. **Economic Impact:**\n   - WTO economists found that economies implementing reforms during accession grew an average of 1.5 percentage points faster than they otherwise would have\n\n6. **Population Coverage:**\n   - Original WTO members represented 69% of world's population\n   - Current members represent 94% of world's population\n   - WTO has extended reach to an additional 2 billion people over past 30 years\n\n7. **Commitments Added:**\n   - Acceded members have added more than 1,500 legally binding commitments to the WTO rulebook\n   - Over 250 specific transparency commitments adopted by acceded members\n   - Acceded members now account for more than one-fifth of total WTO membership\n\n## Key Context:\n\nThe article discusses the broader WTO accession process and its benefits, explaining why governments undertake the rigorous demands of accession (institutional modernization, enhanced business environment, attracting FDI, market-oriented reforms, poverty reduction, sustainable development).

Chronology of Working Party activity and official statements (2023-2026)\n\n\u2022 5 Dec 2024 \u2013 11 Dec 2024 - Geneva visit of Ethiopia\u2019s high-level \u201cSteering Committee on Accession.\u201d During the visit, WTO Deputy Director-General Zhang and Minister Kassahun Gofe Balami agreed on an \u201caccession roadmap \u2026 envisaged for 2026\u201d and preparation for a 5th Working Party (WP) meeting in early-2025 (WTO news24_e/acc_11dec24_e.htm).  \n\u2022 19 Mar 2025 \u2013 5th WP meeting (the first since January 2020). Ethiopia tabled:  \n   \u2013 Revised goods offer (bound rates below LDC agricultural benchmark).  \n   \u2013 Revised services offer (finance, communications, transport, education, tourism).  \n   \u2013 Legislative action plan and responses to outstanding member questions.  \n   \u2013 Target stated by Minister Kassahun: \u201cfinalize the accession process \u2026 and join the WTO family at the 14th Ministerial Conference (MC14) in Yaound\u00e9, March 2026.\u201d  \n   Members were invited to submit written comments by 16 Apr so that the Secretariat could update the Elements of the Draft WP Report, with a tentative aim to hold a 6th WP meeting \u201cbefore the summer break\u201d 2025 (WTO news25_e/acc_19mar25_e.htm; Ethioembassy.ca summary).\n\n\u2022 19 Mar 2025 \u2013 A WTO room document, RD/ACC/12 (restricted), circulated \u201caction plans for the implementation of the TBT, SPS and TRIPS Agreements\u201d (SPSIMS document list). This signals that Ethiopia has begun detailing domestic legal work still outstanding in the three most demanding rule-making areas.\n\n\u2022 26 Sep 2025 \u2013 6th WP meeting. Key take-aways (WTO news25_e/acc_26sep25_e.htm):  \n   \u2013 Ethiopia had answered >200 additional questions and submitted >50 pieces of legislation since March.  \n   \u2013 33 draft accession commitments circulated.  \n   \u2013 Technical parts of bilateral market-access negotiations concluded with six members; negotiations with 12 others \u201cat an advanced stage\u201d.  \n   \u2013 Chair asked members to finish bilaterals \u201cideally before end-November\u201d 2025; Secretariat instructed to upgrade the Elements of a Draft WP Report to a full Draft WP Report.  \n   \u2013 Next WP meeting pencilled in for \u201cearly 2026\u201d.\n\n\u2022 5 Nov 2025 \u2013 Ethiopia signed a Goods-and-Services market-access protocol with China, its first full bilateral deal; Minister Kassahun called the accession process \u201cin a decisive phase\u201d and reiterated the MC14 completion target (Ethiopianmonitor.com, 5 Nov 2025).\n\n\u2022 WTO accession page (a1_ethiopia_e.htm, accessed Feb 2026) records that the WP \u201cmet for the fifth time in March 2025\u201d and is chaired by Amb. Rebecca Fisher-Lamb (UK). The page will be updated when the Draft WP Report is adopted and the accession is legally completed.\n\n2. Information on draft schedules and negotiating documents\n\n\u2022 Draft Goods Schedule: circulated to members before the 5th WP meeting (revised offer, lower agricultural bound rates) \u2013 official reference number not public, but cited in WTO news25_e/acc_19mar25_e.htm.\n\n\u2022 Draft Services Schedule: also revised and broadened (finance, telecoms, transport, education, tourism) \u2013 idem.\n\n\u2022 Elements of a Draft WP Report (sometimes numbered WT/ACC/ETH/\u2014/Draft) \u2013 updated after 16 Apr 2025 comments, then converted to full Draft Report after the 6th WP meeting per WTO news25_e/acc_26sep25_e.htm.\n\n\u2022 Action plans for TBT, SPS and TRIPS implementation \u2013 RD/ACC/12, 19 Mar 2025 (restricted), listed in SPSIMS.\n\nBecause accession documents remain \u201crestricted\u201d until the WP Report is adopted (WTO de-restriction rule on a1_ethiopia_e.htm), none of the detailed schedules or the Draft Report are yet publicly available. Their existence and status are, however, confirmed in the news releases.\n\n3. Remaining legislative and policy steps inside Ethiopia\n\nBased on the questions raised by members and Ethiopia\u2019s own action plans, the still-outstanding domestic tasks are:\n\na. Intellectual-property regime \u2013 Ethiopia must adopt TRIPS-consistent patent, trademark, copyright and enforcement laws. A separate action plan (RD/ACC/12) was tabled, indicating work yet to be completed.\n\nb. SPS / TBT infrastructure \u2013 Ethiopia is preparing laws and implementing regulations to make its sanitary-and-phytosanitary and technical-standards systems WTO-compatible. The checklist documents WT/ACC/ETH/7/Rev.1 (SPS issues, 19 Mar 2025) show that further regulatory alignment is pending.\n\nc. Trade remedies \u2013 Ethiopia has no anti-dumping, countervailing-duty or safeguard legislation in force and therefore must enact primary laws and implementing regulations.\n\nd. State-owned-enterprise disciplines \u2013 Ethiopia is drafting rules (and revising the Investment Holdings legislation) to ensure SOEs operate on commercial terms and comply with WTO subsidy disciplines (Ethioembassy.ca, 19 Mar 2025).\n\ne. Services-sector liberalisation \u2013 banking, insurance, telecoms and logistics laws must be passed in forms that reflect the draft services commitments. Further steps include issuing subsidiary regulations and licensing frameworks, particularly for foreign-equity ceilings and prudential supervision.\n\nf. Customs valuation and import-licensing \u2013 Members posed detailed questions (\u2248130 at the 5th WP) about Ethiopia\u2019s customs valuation methods, licensing procedures and forex controls. Amendments to the Customs Proclamation and the Import/Export Licensing Proclamation are envisaged.\n\ng. Publication and transparency \u2013 Ethiopia committed to adopt a Gazette-type official journal and electronic portal for prompt publication of trade laws, a standard post-accession obligation.\n\nThe government reported the issuance of \u201c130 new laws to reduce WTO-inconsistent trade barriers\u201d by March 2025 and another 50 by September 2025, but members continue to request updates, signalling that some enactments and implementing regulations remain in draft form.\n\n4. Assessment of Ethiopia\u2019s timeline versus MC14 target (March 2026)\n\nPositive factors:  \n\u2022 High-level political ownership \u2013 Prime Minister Abiy met DG Okonjo-Iweala in Feb 2025; multiple ministers sit on the Steering Committee.  \n\u2022 Accelerated WP schedule \u2013 two meetings held in 2025 after a five-year gap, with a pledge to hold another in \u201cearly 2026\u201d.  \n\u2022 Bilateral progress \u2013 first full protocol with China; \u201ctechnical parts\u201d finished with five additional members. If the remaining dozen bilaterals close by end-2025, only legal scrubbing would remain.  \n\u2022 Secretariat upgrading Draft WP Report \u2013 a prerequisite for concluding package.\n\nRisks/uncertainties:  \n\u2022 Restricted documents indicate that substantial legislative work on TRIPS, SPS and trade remedies is pending; Ethiopia may need transition periods but still must table final texts before accession.  \n\u2022 The 6th WP communiqu\u00e9 stresses that \u201csubstance should drive the process, not deadlines,\u201d and several members flagged \u201cthe significant amount of work remaining\u201d (news25_e/acc_26sep25_e.htm).  \n\u2022 No date has yet been fixed for the Final WP meeting; without that, the accession protocol cannot be transmitted to the General Council/MC14.  \n\u2022 Ethiopia must ratify the accession package domestically after signature; timelines for parliamentary approval are not yet disclosed.\n\nOverall, Ethiopia remains on an ambitious but still plausible path to seek General Council approval in early-2026 and formal membership by MC14, if the final WP meeting can be convened by January-February 2026 and if residual legislative packages (especially in IP and SPS) are enacted and notified in 2025.\n\n5. Information gaps\n\n\u2022 Public text or symbol numbers of Ethiopia\u2019s revised goods/services offers and the Draft WP Report are not yet available because of WTO document restrictions.  \n\u2022 Status of each bilateral negotiation (partners, tariff and services concessions) is only partially disclosed; only the China agreement is public.  \n\u2022 Detailed legislative timetable inside Ethiopia (which bills are still in Council of Ministers or Parliament) is not released.  \n\u2022 A firm date for the 7th (presumably final) WP meeting has not been announced as of February 2026.\n\nIf finer-grained analysis is required, the following would be useful once accessible: the full Draft WP Report, Ethiopia\u2019s schedules of concessions (Goods and Services), and the legislative action-plan annexes, together with Ethiopian parliamentary calendars for 2025-2026.</Agent_report>\n"
