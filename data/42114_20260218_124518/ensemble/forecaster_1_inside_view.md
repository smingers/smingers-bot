Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources - Airbus Official Data:**
- **Airbus Orders & Deliveries page (Feb 2026):** FACTUAL - 19 deliveries in January 2026, 793 in full year 2025. Highest quality primary source.
- **AeroTime (Feb 6, 2026):** FACTUAL - Confirms 19 January 2026 deliveries, slowest decade start. Guillaume Faury (CEO) OPINION: engine issues are "trickiest parts." Recent, credible.

**Industry Forecasts:**
- **IBA forecast (Jan 21, 2026):** OPINION - Projects "just over 900" Airbus deliveries for 2026 (700 A320-family, 100+ A220, 42 A330, 65 A350). Industry analyst forecast, moderate credibility.
- **Agent Report:** FACTUAL compilation - April historical data 2019-2025. Multiple analyst forecasts: 913 consensus, 890 Berenberg, ~1,000 Airbus target. High quality synthesis.

**Recent News:**
- **Seattle Times/CNBC (Jan 2026):** FACTUAL - 793 deliveries in 2025. Christian Scherer (Airbus CEO) OPINION: A320 issues won't carry into 2026, engine situation "much brighter now." Recent expert opinion from named executive.
- **Supply Chain articles (Feb 2026):** FACTUAL - Engine shortages persist, Spirit AeroSystems quality issues, A220 production at 7-8/month vs. 12/month target.
- **Air Canada order (Feb 11, 2026):** FACTUAL - 8 A350-1000s disclosed, but order placement not delivery timing.

**Key Factual Evidence:**
1. January 2026: 19 deliveries (vs. 25 in Jan 2025) - weak start
2. 2025 total: 793 deliveries (vs. 766 in 2024, +3.5%)
3. April 2025: 56 deliveries (from historical data)
4. 2026 targets: ~1,000 (Airbus), 890-913 (analysts)

**Key Expert Opinions:**
1. Christian Scherer (Airbus CEO): Engine situation improving, A320 issues resolved
2. Guillaume Faury (Airbus CEO): Engine supply remains challenging
3. IBA: 900+ deliveries achievable in 2026

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Historical April pattern (48-70 range, 2019-2025):** Multiple years of data showing consistent April performance. April 2025 = 56 provides immediate baseline.
- **Weak January 2026 start (19 deliveries):** Primary source data showing 24% decline vs. January 2025. Indicates production challenges persist into 2026.
- **2025 back-end loading pattern:** December 2025 had 136 deliveries (17% of annual total), confirming Airbus concentrates deliveries in Q4. April historically represents 6-7% of annual deliveries.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **CEO statement on engine improvements:** Christian Scherer's "much brighter now" comment suggests Q1 bottlenecks may ease, but timing unclear. Single source, optimistic bias possible.
- **2026 ramp-up target (793→1,000):** 26% increase is ambitious. If achieved proportionally, April could see 56 × 1.26 = 71 deliveries. However, weak January suggests execution risk.
- **Supply chain fragility:** Multiple sources cite ongoing Spirit AeroSystems issues, A220 production delays. Suggests upside limited.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **New assembly capacity:** Two new A320 lines opened in 2025, but ramp-up timing uncertain for April impact.
- **India market expansion:** 1,300 aircraft over 10 years is long-term, no April 2026 impact.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 72 days (Feb 18 → April 30, 2026)

**If halved (36 days, late March):**
- Would predict March 2026 deliveries instead
- Likely lower than April (Q1 typically weaker than Q2)
- January weakness (19) suggests March might be 35-50 range
- More uncertainty due to proximity to weak January data

**If doubled (144 days, early July):**
- Would predict July 2026 deliveries instead
- Mid-year typically shows stronger momentum
- More time for supply chain improvements to materialize
- Historical Q2-Q3 ramp-up suggests 65-80 range
- Greater confidence in production recovery

**Current timeframe (72 days) implications:**
- Sufficient time for modest Q1→Q2 improvement
- Not enough time for major supply chain overhauls
- April represents early Q2, capturing initial ramp-up effects

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Anchor:** April 2019-2025 average = 58 deliveries (range 48-70, excluding COVID 2020)

**Directional Adjustments:**

**Downward Pressure (Moderate):**
1. **January 2026 weakness (19 vs. 25):** -24% YoY decline signals persistent production constraints. If this weakness extends through Q1, April could underperform 2025's 56.
2. **Back-end loading pattern:** If 2026 follows 2025 pattern, April represents ~6% of annual total. Even at 1,000 annual target, this suggests 60 deliveries, not 71 (linear scaling).
3. **Supply chain fragility:** Multiple sources confirm ongoing issues. A220 production at 7-8/month vs. 12/month target indicates delays.

**Upward Pressure (Moderate):**
1. **CEO optimism on engines:** Scherer's statement suggests H1 2026 improvement vs. H2 2025. Could support 10-15% April improvement vs. 2025.
2. **2026 ramp-up commitment:** Airbus publicly targeting 1,000 deliveries requires sustained monthly improvement. April should exceed 2025 baseline.
3. **New capacity online:** Two A320 lines operational since 2025, though ramp-up gradual.

**Net Assessment:**
The weak January start is a strong negative signal that outweighs CEO optimism. However, the 2026 ramp-up target and engine improvements suggest April should modestly exceed 2025's 56. The back-end loading pattern limits upside. I expect April 2026 to land in the 52-68 range, centered around 58-60.

**Distribution Calibration:**

**10th percentile (42):** Severe scenario where January weakness persists, major supply chain disruption, or quality issue emerges. Below worst recent April (48 in 2022).

**20th percentile (50):** Continued Q1 weakness, modest improvement from January but below 2025 April. Supply chain issues limit recovery.

**40th percentile (56):** Matches April 2025 baseline. Status quo scenario where 2026 starts weak but stabilizes at 2025 levels.

**60th percentile (62):** Modest improvement scenario. Engine situation improves as Scherer suggests, April shows 10% gain vs. 2025.

**80th percentile (68):** Strong recovery scenario. Supply chain issues resolve faster than expected, new capacity contributes, April approaches historical peak.

**90th percentile (74):** Optimistic scenario where 2026 ramp-up accelerates early, major bottlenecks clear, widebody deliveries surge. Near historical April maximum (70 in 2019).

## Distribution Calibration

The outside view established a 42-75 range with center around 58-60. Current evidence analysis supports this with slight downward bias due to January weakness.

**Key calibration considerations:**
1. **January signal strength:** 19 deliveries is 33% below April 2025 (56). If April shows similar underperformance, outcome could be ~37. However, Q1→Q2 seasonal improvement typically adds 15-20 deliveries.
2. **Asymmetric risk:** Downside risk (supply chain collapse, quality issues) more severe than upside (production miracles rare). This suggests slightly wider lower tail.
3. **CEO statements:** Scherer's optimism provides moderate upside case but doesn't override hard January data.
4. **Back-end loading:** If 2026 follows 2025 pattern (17% in December), April represents 5-7% of annual total. At 900 deliveries (conservative analyst view), this implies 45-63 range. At 1,000 (Airbus target), implies 50-70 range.

**Adjusted distribution:**
- Shift median slightly down from 60 to 58 (reflecting January weakness)
- Maintain 10th percentile at 42 (severe downside)
- Adjust 90th percentile to 72 (slightly below 75, reflecting execution risk)
- Ensure smooth progression through intermediate percentiles

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** Total Airbus commercial aircraft deliveries reported for April 2026 (single month), measured in aircraft count.

2. **Base rate:** April 2019-2025 average = 58 deliveries (range 48-70). Current prediction maintains this anchor with modest adjustments for 2026 context.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 58; mean ≈ 59. This aligns with April 2025 baseline (56) plus modest 2026 ramp-up, consistent with weak January start offsetting CEO optimism.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - January 2026 = 19 deliveries (24% below January 2025) - VERIFIED from Airbus official data
   - April 2025 = 56 deliveries - VERIFIED from historical compilation
   - CEO Scherer: engine situation "much brighter now" - VERIFIED from Seattle Times interview
   - 2026 target: 900-1,000 deliveries (IBA/analysts/Airbus) - VERIFIED from multiple sources
   - Back-end loading: December 2025 = 136 (17% of annual) - VERIFIED from Airbus data

5. **Blind-spot:** Supply chain breakthrough (e.g., engine supplier resolves bottlenecks faster than expected, Spirit issues cleared) could drive April to 75-80 range, making forecast look conservative. Alternatively, major quality issue (like late 2025 fuselage panels) could push deliveries to 35-40 range.

6. **Status quo:** April 2025 = 56 deliveries. Given weak January and gradual production ramp-up, status quo outcome (55-60 range) remains highly plausible. Volatility moderate in aerospace deliveries; slight nudge toward status quo warranted.

7. **Technicalities:** Values strictly increasing, units = aircraft count, all within 0-150 bounds.
