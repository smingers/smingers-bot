## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **April deliveries 2019-2025 (excluding COVID year 2020):**
   - Most direct comparison
   - Data: 70 (2019), 48 (2022), 54 (2023), 61 (2024), 56 (2025)
   - Mean: ~58, Range: 48-70
   - Suitability: HIGH - same month, similar operational context

2. **Monthly deliveries in 2025:**
   - January 2026 data shows 19 deliveries (unusually low for post-holiday month)
   - 2025 average: 793/12 = 66 per month
   - Suitability: MEDIUM - provides recent baseline but doesn't capture April-specific patterns

3. **Year-over-year growth trajectory:**
   - 2024: 766 deliveries
   - 2025: 793 deliveries (+3.5%)
   - 2026 target: ~1,000 deliveries (+26%)
   - Suitability: MEDIUM - shows ambitious ramp-up plans

**Selected Reference Class:** April deliveries 2019-2025 (excluding 2020) is most suitable, adjusted for 2026 production ramp-up context.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 
- Today: February 18, 2026
- Target month: April 2026
- Time horizon: ~6 weeks away

**Historical April Patterns:**
- April typically represents Q2 start, often showing sequential improvement from Q1
- 2025 pattern: January (25) → April (56) = +124% increase
- However, January 2026 showed only 19 deliveries (below 2025's 25)
- April has historically been mid-range month (not peak like December which had 136 in 2025)

**Seasonal Considerations:**
- Airbus deliveries are heavily back-end loaded (17% of 2025 deliveries in December alone)
- April typically shows moderate activity as production ramps through the year
- Q1-Q2 transition period

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate from April Historical Data:**
The April delivery figures from 2019-2025 (excluding COVID-impacted 2020) cluster around 48-70 units, with recent years showing 54 (2023), 61 (2024), and 56 (2025). The mean is approximately 58 deliveries.

**Adjustments for 2026 Context:**

*Positive Factors:*
1. **Production ramp-up target:** Airbus aims for ~1,000 deliveries in 2026 vs. 793 in 2025 (+26% increase)
2. **Engine supply improving:** Christian Scherer stated engine situation is "much brighter now"
3. **A320 issues resolved:** Late 2025 quality problems stated to not carry into 2026
4. **New assembly capacity:** Two new A320 lines opened in 2025 (China, Mobile AL)

*Negative Factors:*
1. **Weak January 2026:** Only 19 deliveries (vs. 25 in Jan 2025) suggests slow start
2. **Supply chain fragility:** Spirit AeroSystems issues, persistent Tier-1 supplier risks
3. **Back-end loading pattern:** If 2026 follows 2025 pattern, April will be below annual average
4. **A220 delays:** Production target pushed to December 2026, currently 7-8/month vs. target 12/month

**Synthesis:**
The 2026 ramp-up is ambitious but faces execution risk. If Airbus achieves 1,000 deliveries in 2026 with similar back-end loading, April might represent ~6-7% of annual deliveries (60-70 units). However, the weak January start and persistent supply chain challenges suggest caution. A reasonable outside view centers around 55-65 deliveries, slightly above recent April averages but below what a linear ramp would suggest.

Outside view calibration:

**Distribution Anchoring:**
- Historical April range (2019-2025, ex-2020): 48-70
- 2025 April baseline: 56
- Proportional 2026 target adjustment: 56 × (1000/793) = 71 (if linear scaling)
- Realistic expectation accounting for slow start: 50-70 range

**Tail Considerations:**

*Lower tail (10th percentile):*
- Severe supply chain disruption or quality issue (similar to late 2025)
- Major geopolitical event affecting deliveries
- Minimum plausible: ~40 (below worst recent April except COVID)

*Upper tail (90th percentile):*
- Successful early resolution of Q1 bottlenecks
- Aggressive catch-up from weak January
- Strong widebody contribution
- Maximum plausible: ~75 (above historical April peak)

**Unexpected Outcomes:**
- Aerospace delivery disruptions occur ~10-15% of the time (strikes, quality issues, supplier failures)
- This domain shows moderate volatility, suggesting 10th-90th percentile range should span ~35 units
- January weakness is a concerning signal that warrants wider lower tail

**Calibration Strategy:**
- Center distribution around 58-60 (slightly above recent April average)
- 10th percentile: 42 (accounts for continued weakness)
- 90th percentile: 75 (accounts for successful ramp-up)
- Intermediate percentiles should reflect gradual probability accumulation

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 42
Percentile 20: 50
Percentile 40: 57
Percentile 60: 62
Percentile 80: 68
Percentile 90: 75
