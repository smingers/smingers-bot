Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary/Official Sources:**
- **Airbus Orders & Deliveries page** (Jan 2026): Highly reliable primary source. Reports 19 deliveries in January 2026 to 15 customers. This is the gold standard for resolution.
- **Airbus press releases** (Feb 2026): Official company communications confirming Air Canada A350 order disclosure. High reliability for factual data.

**Aviation Trade Press:**
- **AeroTime** (Feb 6, 2026): Reports January 2026 deliveries (19 aircraft), provides historical context (Jan 2025: 26; Jan 2024: 30). Quotes CEO Faury on supply chain issues, particularly engine shortages. Factual delivery numbers are reliable; CEO quotes are expert opinion from identifiable source.
- **IBA forecast** via AviTrader (Jan 21, 2026): Industry analyst forecasts ~900 Airbus deliveries for 2026 (700 A320-family, 100+ A220, 42 A330, 65 A350). This is expert opinion with clear methodology, though forward-looking.
- **Simple Flying, Capital.com, Meyka** (Jan-Feb 2026): Secondary sources aggregating delivery data and analyst forecasts. Useful for corroboration but derivative.

**Key Factual Data Points:**
- January 2026: 19 deliveries (confirmed, official)
- Full year 2025: 793 deliveries (confirmed, official)
- 2025 monthly average: ~66 deliveries/month
- April 2025: 56 deliveries (from outside view analysis)
- Supply chain constraints ongoing (multiple sources, CEO confirmation)
- Engine shortages remain "trickiest" issue (CEO Faury, expert opinion)

**Expert Opinions (Identifiable):**
- Guillaume Faury (Airbus CEO): Supply chain issues persist, engines are bottleneck
- IBA analysts: Forecast 900 total for 2026
- DBS Bank: Expects continued delivery growth with supply chain risks

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **January 2026 baseline (19 deliveries)**: Multiple independent sources confirm this official figure. This represents the slowest January this decade, establishing a weak start to 2026. This is 27% below January 2025 (26) and 37% below January 2024 (30). **Impact: Downward pressure on April forecast.**

2. **Persistent supply chain constraints**: CEO Faury's direct statement (expert, identifiable) confirms engine shortages remain the primary bottleneck. Historical pattern shows these constraints have persisted through 2024-2025. Multiple sources corroborate. **Impact: Moderate downward pressure, limits upside potential.**

3. **2025 full-year performance (793 deliveries)**: Airbus met revised guidance but fell short of original 820 target. December 2025 saw heavy back-loading (~121 deliveries estimated). This pattern suggests production smoothing issues continue. **Impact: Suggests April will remain in historical range, not breakthrough.**

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **IBA forecast (900 total for 2026)**: Single expert source with clear methodology. Represents 13.5% increase over 2025. If proportional, April would be ~63 deliveries. However, January's weak start (19 vs expected ~75 if linear) suggests this may be optimistic. **Impact: Modest upward pressure on central estimate.**

2. **Historical April seasonality**: April typically represents 7-8% of annual deliveries (2024-2025 data). With weak Q1 start, Airbus may need to accelerate in Q2-Q4 to meet targets, potentially boosting April above historical average. **Impact: Slight upward pressure.**

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Air Canada A350 order disclosure**: Confirms order backlog strength but doesn't directly impact April 2026 delivery timing. **Impact: Minimal.**

2. **India market expansion commentary**: Long-term strategic information (1,300 aircraft over decade) with no bearing on April 2026. **Impact: None.**

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Timeframe**: 72 days from today (Feb 18) to resolution (~May 5-10, 2026 when April data published). April itself is 41-71 days away.

**Short timeframe implications:**
- Production schedules for April are largely locked in now
- Engine delivery schedules for March-April aircraft are already determined
- Little room for strategic pivots or major supply chain improvements
- Weather/logistics disruptions in March-April could impact delivery timing

**If timeframe halved (36 days → early March)**: Would be forecasting March deliveries instead. Likely similar to February, possibly 25-35 range given January weakness. More constrained by current production state.

**If timeframe doubled (144 days → June)**: Would allow more time for supply chain improvements to materialize. June typically sees acceleration toward mid-year. Likely 65-80 range with higher confidence in upside.

**Current timeframe assessment**: April is early enough that January's weakness matters significantly, but late enough that some Q1 recovery is possible. The weak January start is a strong negative signal for Q1 overall.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view baseline**: Centered on 62, with P10=45, P50≈61, P90=85

**Key factors warranting adjustment:**

1. **January 2026 weakness (19 deliveries)**: This is the most significant new information. January 2026 is 27% below January 2025 and represents the weakest start this decade. If this weakness persists through Q1, April could be significantly below the 56 delivered in April 2025. However, Airbus historically back-loads deliveries, so weak January doesn't necessarily predict weak April. **Adjustment: Shift distribution down 5-10%, widen lower tail.**

2. **CEO confirmation of ongoing constraints**: Faury's explicit statement that engines remain "trickiest" suggests the supply chain issues that plagued 2024-2025 have not materially improved entering 2026. This limits upside potential. **Adjustment: Compress upper tail, reduce P90.**

3. **2026 guidance context**: IBA forecasts 900 total (vs 793 in 2025). To achieve this with weak January start requires acceleration. April would need to be ~63-70 if deliveries are evenly distributed across remaining months. However, Airbus typically accelerates in Q4, not Q2. **Adjustment: Modest upward pressure on median, but not enough to overcome January signal.**

4. **Historical April patterns**: April 2019-2025 range: 14-70, with post-pandemic range 48-61. The 2025 figure of 56 is a strong anchor. Without evidence of breakthrough supply chain improvement, expecting April 2026 to significantly exceed 56 requires optimism not supported by January data. **Adjustment: Keep median close to 2025 level (55-58 range).**

**Net assessment**: January's weakness is a strong negative signal that outweighs optimistic 2026 guidance. The outside view centered on 62 appears slightly optimistic given current evidence. I will shift the distribution down modestly (median ~55-57) and widen the lower tail to account for possibility that January's weakness extends through Q1.

## Distribution Calibration

**Central tendency**: Given January weakness (19) and persistent supply chain issues, I expect April 2026 to be similar to or slightly below April 2025 (56). The median should be 55-57.

**Lower tail (P10-P20)**: January's weakness suggests meaningful downside risk. If supply chain issues worsen or quality holds occur (as in late 2025), April could drop to 40-45 range. P10=42 accounts for severe disruption without assuming catastrophic collapse.

**Upper tail (P80-P90)**: Limited upside given January data. For April to reach 70+, Airbus would need dramatic acceleration in February-March, which seems unlikely given CEO's comments. P90=75 allows for better-than-expected recovery without assuming breakthrough performance.

**Distribution shape**: Slightly negatively skewed (longer lower tail) given asymmetric risks. Supply chain disruptions can happen quickly; improvements take time.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: Total number of Airbus commercial aircraft deliveries reported for April 2026 (single month, units=count, resolution ~May 5-10, 2026)

2. **Outside view base rate**: Centered on 62, P10=45, P50≈61, P90=85. My forecast shifts this down ~5-8% based on January weakness signal.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median ≈ 55; mean ≈ 56. This aligns with April 2025 (56) and reflects modest pessimism from January data while acknowledging possible Q2 recovery.

4. **Three most significant evidence pieces**:
   - January 2026 delivered only 19 aircraft (27% below Jan 2025) - factually confirmed, official data
   - CEO Faury confirms engines remain primary bottleneck - expert opinion, identifiable source
   - April 2025 delivered 56 aircraft - factual baseline from official data
   - IBA forecasts 900 total for 2026 (~13.5% growth) - expert forecast, clear methodology
   - 2025 pattern showed heavy Q4 back-loading, not Q2 strength - factual pattern from official data

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Airbus achieves breakthrough in engine supply chain in February-March, allowing rapid acceleration. This would push April deliveries to 70-80 range, making my forecast look too conservative. Alternatively, a major quality issue or strike could push deliveries below 40, making forecast too optimistic.

6. **Status quo outcome**: April 2025 delivered 56. Given slow-changing production systems and January weakness, status quo or slight decline (52-56 range) is most likely. My forecast centers on 55, very close to status quo.

7. **Technicalities**: Values strictly increasing, units are count (integer), all values within 0-150 bounds. P10=42 > 0, P90=75 < 150.
