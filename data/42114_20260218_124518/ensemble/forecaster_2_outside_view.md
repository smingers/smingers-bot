Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Airbus Sources (High Quality, Current):**
- **Airbus Orders & Deliveries page (Jan 2026 data)**: Official source showing 19 deliveries in January 2026, 793 deliveries for full year 2025. This is the gold standard for historical data.
- **Airbus press release (Jan 12, 2026)**: Confirms 793 deliveries in 2025, mentions upward trajectory and widebody backlog record of 1,124 aircraft.

**Aviation Industry Publications (High Quality):**
- **Aviation Week (April 2025 data)**: Reports 50 Airbus narrowbody deliveries in April 2025 (7 A220s, 43 A320neo-family). Note: This excludes widebody deliveries, so total April 2025 was likely 56 units per the agent report.
- **Seattle Times (Jan 13, 2026)**: Comprehensive article with quotes from Airbus executives Christian Scherer and Benoît de Saint-Exupéry. Key facts: 793 deliveries in 2025 (up 4% from 766 in 2024), target reduced from 820 to ~790 in December 2025 due to A320 fuselage panel quality issues. Engine supply constraints mentioned but described as "much brighter now."
- **Air Data News (Oct 28, 2025)**: Details A220 production delays, current rate of 7-8/month, target of 14/month pushed to December 2026.

**Agent Report (Comprehensive Historical Dataset):**
The agent report provides crucial April delivery figures:
- 2019: 70 deliveries
- 2020: 14 deliveries (COVID impact)
- 2022: 48 deliveries
- 2023: 54 deliveries
- 2024: 61 deliveries
- 2025: 56 deliveries

The report also notes 2026 guidance of "working toward about 1,000 commercial aircraft deliveries" with analyst consensus at 913 (range includes Berenberg at 890).

**Expert Opinions (Identifiable):**
- Christian Scherer (Airbus CEO): A320 issues won't carry into 2026, engine situation "much brighter now"
- Supply chain constraints remain but are improving

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**
1. **April deliveries 2019-2025**: Most direct comparison for April 2026
2. **Monthly deliveries in 2025**: Shows recent monthly patterns
3. **Q2 deliveries historically**: April is typically a mid-quarter month
4. **Year-over-year growth rates**: 2025 vs 2024 performance

**Most Suitable: April deliveries 2019-2025**
This is the most directly relevant reference class. Excluding the COVID-impacted 2020 (14 deliveries), we see:
- 2019: 70 (pre-COVID peak)
- 2022: 48 (recovery phase)
- 2023: 54 (continued recovery)
- 2024: 61 (growth)
- 2025: 56 (slight decline)

The 2022-2025 range of 48-61 deliveries represents post-COVID normalized operations with supply chain constraints.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** April 2026 is approximately 2.5 months away (72 days from Feb 18, 2026).

**Historical April Patterns:**
- April typically represents 6-8% of annual deliveries based on available data
- 2025: 56 April deliveries out of 793 annual = 7.1%
- 2024: 61 April deliveries (partial year data available)
- 2023: 54 April deliveries out of 735 annual = 7.3%

**Seasonal Considerations:**
- Airbus deliveries are heavily back-end loaded (17% of 2025 deliveries in December alone)
- April is a Q2 month, typically showing moderate delivery rates
- January 2026 showed only 19 deliveries, suggesting a slow start to the year

**Production Trajectory:**
- 2025 full year: 793 deliveries
- 2026 guidance: ~1,000 deliveries (official) to 913 (analyst consensus)
- This implies 15-26% year-over-year growth
- Monthly average needed for 913 deliveries: 76/month
- Monthly average needed for 1,000 deliveries: 83/month

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate from Historical Aprils:**
The 2022-2025 April range of 48-61 deliveries (mean: 55, median: 55) provides a strong baseline. However, several factors suggest April 2026 could differ:

**Upward Pressures:**
1. **Production ramp-up target**: Airbus aims for 1,000 deliveries in 2026 vs 793 in 2025 (+26%)
2. **Supply chain improvements**: Engine situation described as "much brighter" by CEO
3. **New assembly lines**: Two new A320 lines opened in 2025 (China, Mobile AL)
4. **Slow January start**: 19 deliveries in Jan 2026 suggests pent-up demand/backlog that could release in Q2

**Downward Pressures:**
1. **Conservative analyst consensus**: 913 deliveries (vs company target of 1,000) suggests skepticism
2. **Historical pattern**: January 2026 (19 units) is well below the ~66/month pace needed for 1,000 annual deliveries
3. **Persistent supply chain issues**: A220 delays, Spirit AeroSystems quality problems
4. **Back-end loading**: Historically, Airbus delivers disproportionately in Q4, meaning Q2 months like April may remain moderate

**Most Likely Scenario:**
If 2026 deliveries reach 913 (analyst consensus), April would represent ~7.2% = 66 deliveries. If deliveries reach only 850 due to continued supply constraints, April would be ~61 deliveries. The historical April range of 48-61 may be slightly exceeded due to production ramp-up efforts, but dramatic increases are unlikely given the slow January start and persistent supply chain challenges.

Outside view calibration:

**Distribution Anchoring:**
- Historical April range (2022-2025): 48-61 deliveries
- Mean: 55 deliveries
- Standard deviation: ~5 deliveries

**Adjustments for 2026 Context:**
1. **Production target increase**: +15-26% year-over-year suggests potential upside
2. **Slow start**: January 2026 (19) was 24% below January 2025 (25), suggesting challenges persist
3. **Supply chain improvements**: Gradual improvement expected but not transformational by April

**Uncertainty Factors:**
- Unknown unknowns: New quality issues, geopolitical disruptions, supplier failures
- Historical upset rate: Airbus missed 2025 target by ~4% (820→793), showing forecasting difficulty
- April 2025 saw unexpected decline from 61→56 despite overall growth trajectory

**Percentile Reasoning:**
- **10th percentile (45)**: Represents scenario where supply chain issues worsen or new quality problems emerge, similar to April 2022 performance
- **20th percentile (52)**: Below-average performance with continued constraints
- **40th percentile (58)**: Modest improvement over April 2025, reflecting gradual ramp-up
- **60th percentile (65)**: Successful early execution of 2026 production plan
- **80th percentile (72)**: Strong recovery and acceleration toward 1,000-unit target
- **90th percentile (78)**: Optimistic scenario with breakthrough in supply chain constraints

The distribution centers around 60-65 deliveries, reflecting modest growth over April 2025 (56) but acknowledging significant execution risk given the slow January start and persistent supply chain challenges.
