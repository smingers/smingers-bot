Analysis:
1) Target variable / resolution criteria  
This resolves to Airbus’ officially reported count of **commercial aircraft “deliveries” in April 2026** (units: aircraft), per Airbus’ monthly Orders & Deliveries data.

(a) Source analysis (quality, date, facts vs opinions)
- Airbus “Orders & Deliveries” page (official; reports Jan 2026 = 19 deliveries): **Highest-quality primary data**, current for Jan 2026. Pure facts for deliveries/orders; no forecast.
- AeroTime (Feb 6, 2026) summarizing Jan 2026 deliveries and quoting CEO on supply-chain/engines: **Good secondary**, but relies on Airbus/Reuters. Facts: Jan deliveries=19. Opinion/expert: Faury notes engines “trickiest parts,” ongoing constraints.
- IBA forecast via AviTrader (Jan 21, 2026): **Moderate-quality** industry projection. Fact: IBA projects **just over 900 Airbus deliveries in 2026** (annual, not monthly). This is methodology-dependent and not binding.
- MarketScreener / analyst-preview (Feb 16, 2026): **Moderate-quality**; summarizes analyst expectations. Key: analysts cautious; delivery target around **~880** mentioned. Mix of facts and analyst opinion.
- Other AskNews items (India/stockpulse/helicopters/A380 cabin refit/Lufthansa seating): **Mostly weak relevance** to commercial fixed-wing April deliveries. Helicopters irrelevant; stock moves irrelevant; India backlog indicates demand but not near-term delivery throughput.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence
- **Official Airbus monthly delivery reporting + clear seasonality/back-end loading**: structural and historically predictive (deliveries tend to be lower early-year, higher late-year).

Moderate evidence
- **Jan 2026 deliveries = 19 (official)**: a direct, reliable datapoint indicating a slow start; informative for near-term supply-chain/engine flow into spring.
- **Analyst/industry annual expectations (~880–just over 900 for 2026)**: suggests modest YoY increase vs 2025 (793), but not a breakout ramp by April.

Weak evidence
- India backlog / long-term delivery plans: demand signal, but weakly connected to April 2026 execution.
- Generic “supply chain strains continue” commentary: directionally relevant but non-quantified for April.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Today: 2026-02-18. April 2026 is ~6–10 weeks away (and the question resolves once Airbus publishes April’s monthly figure, by ~May 1).  
- If the timeframe were halved (e.g., forecasting March instead of April), I’d lean slightly lower because less time for bottleneck-clearing/catch-up from January.  
- If doubled (e.g., forecasting June/July), I’d shift the distribution modestly higher and widen the upside tail, since mid-year catch-up and delivery “re-timing” become more plausible.

(d) Justification (how inside view shifts outside view)
Outside view base rate (given):  
P10 45 / P20 52 / P40 58 / P60 65 / P80 72 / P90 78

Key new inside-view adjustment: January 2026 delivered only 19 aircraft (slowest decade start per AeroTime; also confirmed on Airbus page). That is a meaningful signal that engine/supplier constraints are still binding in early 2026. However, January is typically a low month anyway, and Airbus historically “catches up” later in the year; April is mid-quarter and often near the “normal” run-rate for the year.

So I apply a **small downward shift to the center** (relative to the outside view), while keeping tails fairly wide:
- Downward pressure: Jan weakness + continued engine constraints discussed by management/press.
- Upward pressure: large backlog and strong demand; deliveries can be re-timed into later months; industry/analyst expectations still imply higher 2026 totals than 2025.

Net: modest reduction in median/mean vs the outside view, but not a wholesale re-anchoring (because January alone is noisy and Airbus delivery seasonality is strong).

Distribution calibration
- “Trend continued” scenario: if early-2026 constraints persist into spring, April could look closer to 2025’s April (mid-50s) or slightly below (low-50s).
- “Catch-up” scenario: if January was unusually low due to timing and Airbus clears stored gliders/engines by Q2, April could land mid-to-high 60s, possibly low 70s.
- Tail thinking: downside tail includes a renewed supplier quality/engine disruption; upside tail includes a focused delivery push or release of held aircraft.

Checklist:
1) Variable: Airbus **commercial aircraft deliveries in April 2026**, count, per official monthly data.
2) Outside view base distribution: (45, 52, 58, 65, 72, 78).
3) Consistency: implied median ≈ 60th percentile = 63; mean ≈ low 60s; consistent with “slightly-downshifted center, wide tails.”
4) Top evidence (3–5):
   - Official: **Jan 2026 deliveries = 19** (slow start).
   - Persistent supply-chain/engine constraints acknowledged by Airbus leadership/press.
   - Historical April deliveries cluster roughly **high-40s to low-60s** post-2021; April not typically a peak month.
   - Analyst/industry 2026 totals (~880–900+) imply April likely around low-to-mid 60s if on track.
5) Blind spot: a sudden, acute engine/supplier disruption in March–April that forces many handovers to slip (pushes outcome down).
6) Status quo anchor: April 2025 about mid-50s; my forecast stays close but slightly higher central tendency.
7) Technicalities: percentiles strictly increasing; units are counts; within 0–150.
