Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; fact vs opinion)

1. **Airbus “Orders & Deliveries” page / PDFs (official) — includes January 2026**
   - **Facts:** January 2026 deliveries = **19**; 2025 full-year deliveries = **793**; January gross orders = 49.
   - **Quality:** Highest for deliveries; primary source for resolution.
   - **Use here:** Confirms a *very low* January (seasonality/production flow), and anchors the latest known annual total (2025=793). January itself is not directly predictive of April, but signals early-year volatility.

2. **Airbus press release (Jan 12, 2026) on 2025 deliveries**
   - **Facts:** 2025 deliveries **793**; widebody backlog commentary (record 1,124).
   - **Quality:** Very high for annual totals; less direct for monthly April forecasting.
   - **Use here:** Sets the current production system scale (high-700s delivered) heading into 2026.

3. **Aviation Week snippet (April 2025 narrowbodies)**
   - **Facts (partial):** Airbus narrowbody deliveries in April 2025 stated as **50** (7 A220 + 43 A320neo-family), *excluding widebodies*.
   - **Quality:** Medium—credible outlet but paywall truncation; also incomplete scope.
   - **Use here:** Suggests April 2025 total deliveries (56 in other sources) were dominated by narrowbodies, consistent with Airbus mix.

4. **Seattle Times (Jan 13, 2026)**
   - **Facts:** Repeats 2025 Airbus deliveries 793; describes late-2025 A320 disruptions and engine constraints (gliders).
   - **Opinions / interpretations:** Quotes Airbus executives saying issues won’t carry into 2026 / “much brighter now.”
   - **Quality:** Medium-high for reported figures and quotes; not a primary operational dataset.
   - **Use here:** Context for supply-chain uncertainty, but as “outside view” I treat it mainly as background, not as a quantified driver.

5. **CNBC (Jan 11, 2026)**
   - **Facts:** Mostly Boeing-focused; general demand statements and analyst quotes.
   - **Quality:** Medium; not directly informative for Airbus April deliveries.
   - **Use here:** Minimal, aside from reinforcing that demand is strong and supply is the binding constraint.

6. **Air Data News (Oct 28, 2025) on A220 ramp delay**
   - **Facts/claims:** A220 rate targets delayed; current 7–8/month; internal targets.
   - **Quality:** Medium-low to medium (trade site; not Airbus official). Directionally plausible, but I discount precise numbers.
   - **Use here:** Adds uncertainty: if A220 underperforms, monthly totals could sag a bit, though A320-family dominates overall.

7. **Agent report: compiled monthly April delivery figures (2019–2025) + 2026 guidance snippets**
   - **Facts (as compiled):** April deliveries: **2019 70; 2020 14; 2022 48; 2023 54; 2024 61; 2025 56** (2021 missing). Notes December 2025 = 136 and back-end loading.
   - **Quality:** Mixed—useful as a *reference-class extractor*, but some values come from secondary reporting; I treat the April series as approximately correct and directionally robust, but not as authoritative as Airbus PDFs.
   - **Use here:** This is the key empirical backbone for an outside-view April forecast.

### (b) Reference class analysis (what past set best matches “April 2026 deliveries?”)

Candidate reference classes:

1. **Airbus April deliveries in the post-pandemic, recent production regime (2022–2025):** 48, 54, 61, 56  
   - **Pros:** Closest to current supply-chain + rate environment; avoids pandemic distortion.  
   - **Cons:** Only 4 points; still sensitive to one-off disruptions.

2. **Airbus April deliveries including pandemic and pre-pandemic (2019–2025 excluding 2021):** 70, 14, 48, 54, 61, 56  
   - **Pros:** Captures “upset” possibilities (e.g., 2020 collapse), provides broader tail risk.
   - **Cons:** 2019 may reflect a different scale/product mix; 2020 is an extreme outlier.

3. **Monthly deliveries implied by annual totals (e.g., 2025=793 ⇒ avg 66/month) with known back-end loading**
   - **Pros:** Gives a macro constraint and seasonality intuition.
   - **Cons:** Without a full monthly distribution table, it’s weak for pinning down April specifically.

**Most suitable:** **(1) April 2022–2025** as the central reference class, **with (2)** used to widen downside tails (rare but real shocks).

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Today:** 2026-02-18  
- **Target month:** April 2026 (reported in early May).  
- **Time until month starts:** ~6 weeks; **time until resolution:** ~10 weeks.

Historical pattern relevant to this horizon:
- Airbus deliveries are **seasonal and operationally “lumpy”** (paperwork, engine availability, customer acceptance timing).
- Recent Aprils cluster in the **high-40s to low-60s** (post-pandemic).
- The dataset also shows **rare regime breaks** (e.g., April 2020 = 14).

### (d) Justification (outside view)

Using the most comparable recent Aprils (2022–2025): **48, 54, 61, 56**
- Mean ≈ **55**
- Median ≈ **55**
- Typical spread: roughly **±6–7** around the mid-50s in “normal” recent years.

Now incorporate *outside-view trend pressure* (without leaning too hard on inside-view narratives):
- 2025 annual deliveries were **793** and there is widely discussed intent/expectation of **higher 2026** deliveries (various sources mention ~900–1000 “working toward” / consensus). If the system is gradually ramping, April 2026 should be **at least** in the recent normal band, and plausibly a bit higher than the 2022–2025 mean.
- However, April is still early in the year, and Airbus historically shows **back-end loading**. Even in an improving year, April need not jump to the annual average.

So the outside-view center should be **mid-to-high 50s**, with a modest upward tilt to around **~60** as a median/central estimate, while keeping **wide uncertainty** to reflect supply-chain shocks and acceptance timing volatility.

Outside view calibration:

- I’m aiming for a distribution that:
  - Centers near the **recent April cluster (mid/high-50s)**,
  - Allows a **meaningful downside** (e.g., supplier/engine/quality disruption causing a poor month),
  - Allows a **meaningful upside** (a strong handover month if bottlenecks clear and acceptance timing aligns),
  - But keeps **extreme highs (100+)** as low-probability for April specifically.

Given the observed April range in recent years (48–61) and the existence of rare shocks (2020), I set a **wide 10–90** interval.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 38  
Percentile 20: 45  
Percentile 40: 55  
Percentile 60: 63  
Percentile 80: 72  
Percentile 90: 85
