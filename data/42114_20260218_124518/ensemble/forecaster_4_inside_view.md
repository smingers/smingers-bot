Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (facts vs. opinion – abbreviations)
1. Airbus Orders & Deliveries page, 6 Feb 2026: FACT – January-26 deliveries = 19, orders = 49.  Primary, fully reliable.  
2. AeroTime, 6 Feb 2026: FACT – repeats 19 January deliveries; OPINION – “slowest start of decade”.  Reliable trade press, but secondary.  
3. Airbus 12 Jan 2026 press release: FACT – 2025 total deliveries = 793.  Primary.  
4. AviTrader 21 Jan 2026: OPINION/forecast – IBA expects “just over 900” Airbus deliveries in 2026.  One expert firm; moderate quality.  
5. Market-/stock-notes (Meyka, Stockpulse, Marketscreener): contain no April-specific delivery data; only investor sentiment.  Weak for our purpose.

(b) Evidence analysis
• Strong: Official Airbus monthly PDFs establish the normal seasonal pattern (Jan low, Apr mid-range).  
• Moderate: IBA industry forecast of ~900 deliveries implies a 2026 monthly average ≈ 74.  Credible, but not Airbus guidance.  
• Weak: Headlines about supply-chain strain and ramp-up lines – useful colour yet hard to quantify for a single month.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Today (18 Feb 2026) → first week of May 2026 (publication) ≈ 10 weeks.  If we had only five weeks, February data would be known and could shift the forecast ±7 jets; if doubled, new guidance or fresh shocks could widen the tails a little.

(d) Justification – moving from outside to inside view
Outside view (Apr 22-25): 48, 54, 61, 56  → mean/median ≈ 55.  
Adjustments:

Upward forces  
• IBA and most analysts expect a 10-12 % y-o-y delivery rise in 2026.  If evenly spread, April should edge above recent Aprils (+6 jets).   (moderate)  
• Two new A320 lines (Tianjin extension Oct 25, Toulouse conversion mid-26) begin to feed output; engine shortages said to be “much brighter now” (moderate).  

Downward forces  
• January-26 was an exceptionally weak 19 deliveries (vs 26/30 in 2025/2024).  Catch-up is likely, but still signals continuing friction.  (moderate)  
• No hard evidence yet that Pratt & Whitney and fuselage-panel problems are fully fixed; a single-supplier hic-cup could suppress an early-spring month.  (moderate)

Net: modest upward tilt, not a step-change.  I shift the whole distribution about +3 to +5 jets relative to the base and broaden tails slightly to respect residual risk.

Checklist:
1. Target variable: “Number of Airbus commercial aircraft delivered in April 2026” – integer count, global, any type.  
2. Base-rate distribution: April 2022-25 mean 55; see above.  
3. Consistency: implied median ≈ 60 (mid-point of 55 & 65) and mean ≈ 61; coherent with 2026 ramp but still < monthly average of a 900-jet year.  
4. Key evidence:  
   – April 22-25 deliveries 48-61 (strong, historic)  
   – Jan-26 deliveries only 19 (moderate, near-term weakness)  
   – IBA forecast “just over 900” deliveries 2026 (moderate upward)  
   – Engine/structure bottlenecks easing but not gone (moderate)  
5. Blind-spot: sudden mass-release of January/February “gliders” in late April could spike deliveries above 100 (pushes outcome up).  
6. Status-quo: mid-50s; my median +5 reflects mild growth yet respects inertia.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; all within 0–150 unit bounds.
