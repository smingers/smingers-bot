Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
• Airbus official Orders & Deliveries PDFs (summaries quoted 2019-2025) – primary data, published monthly by the company; factual and highly reliable.  
• Aviation Week (Apr-25 narrow-body data) – reputable trade press, factual figures for a single month.  
• Simple Flying, AeroTime, FlightGlobal, Leeham, Seattle Times, CNBC – specialist or mainstream outlets that mostly relay Airbus press releases; useful corroboration of monthly/annual numbers and supply-chain commentary; minimal opinion value except when quoting Airbus executives.  
• Agent report – compiles the hard numbers for every April 2019-2025 and collects guidance snippets (target “about 1 000” jets in 2026; analyst consensus ≈ 900). Dates range Oct-25 – Jan-26, all recent and pre-question-opening.  

b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. “All Airbus monthly deliveries” (2019-2025, n=84).  
2. “All Airbus April deliveries” (2019-2025, n=7).  
3. “Second-quarter monthly deliveries in the first year after guidance hikes” (very small n).  
Class 2 is the tightest match: same month, similar supply-chain cadence, same company. We therefore base the outside view on the seven observed April figures: 70, 14, 48, 54, 61, 56; (2021 still missing – assume ~45 by interpolation between 2020 rebound and 2022). This yields a sample mean ≈ 50 and st.dev ≈ 15.  

c) Time-frame analysis  
Today is 18 Feb 2026; the outcome will be known ~ 75 days from now. Airbus usually releases the April PDF around 5–10 May, so there is little time for radical strategic change before the measurement month. Short horizon ⇒ macro demand shocks matter less than production flow.  

Historical pattern: deliveries collapsed in April 2020 (14) because of Covid but rebounded to a 48-61 band in 2022-2025 despite continuing supply-chain noise. Deliveries remain back-loaded into Q4 (≈17 % in Dec 2025). In 2025, April accounted for 7 % of the yearly total; in 2024, 8 %.  

d) Justification  
Outside view starts with the empirical April distribution (mean 50). 2020 is an extreme outlier unlikely to repeat; excluding it, the mean is 57 and st.dev 8. Airbus intends to lift full-year output from 793 (2025) toward 900-1 000 (2026). If successful, proportional scaling would place April around 60-70. Conversely, lingering engine shortages or one-off quality holds could keep April similar to 2025 (~56) or even push it into the mid-40s. Catastrophic shocks (strike, major safety grounding) are possible but low-frequency; upside spikes beyond 85 would require unusually smooth supply flow early in the year – historically, Airbus has never delivered > 70 in April.  

Balancing those considerations I treat 2025 (56) as the modal anchor, add modest upward drift, and keep fat(ish) tails for downside disruption or unusually good execution.  

Outside view calibration:  
• Centre the distribution on 62 (slightly above 2025, below the “scaled-to-900” 63-70 midpoint).  
• Empirical April range (post-pandemic) 48-61 informs the inter-quartile band.  
• 10th percentile set one full historical st.dev below the trimmed mean (≈45) to absorb low-probability holdups.  
• 90th percentile set at the historical maximum (70) plus one st.dev (≈15) rounded → 85, giving room for an upside surprise without assuming breakthrough performance > 90.  
• Percentiles strictly increasing; tails wider than a normal curve (kurtosis for unknown-unknowns).  

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 45  
Percentile 20: 50  
Percentile 40: 58  
Percentile 60: 65  
Percentile 80: 75  
Percentile 90: 85
