Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, all dates 2026 unless noted)
• Airbus “Orders & Deliveries” page, Jan data (primary, published 6 Feb). Hard fact: 19 deliveries in Jan-26. No forward opinion. Very high reliability.
• AeroTime article “Slowest year start” (6 Feb). Re-states 19 Jan deliveries, quotes CEO on persisting supply-chain and engine shortages. Facts solid, opinions attributable to Guillaume Faury (high-level insider → useful).
• Meyka pre-earnings note (16 Feb). Lists analyst consensus EBIT/FCF and says investors will watch delivery guidance. Facts come from Visible Alpha; quality medium.
• de.MarketScreener focus piece (16 Feb). Says analysts project c. 880 deliveries for 2026 and highlights engine constraints. Single reliable source (Dow Jones). Moderate quality.
• AviTrader IBA forecast (21 Jan). Predicts “just over 900” Airbus deliveries in 2026 with breakdown by family. Industry consultancy, good historical accuracy → moderate/strong.
• Historical monthly delivery table 2019-25 (internal collation from Airbus PDFs). Matches spot-checked press releases, treated as primary-derived, high reliability.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong
1. Historical April share of yearly deliveries is stable around 7-8 % for 2022-25 (structural, multiple primary sources).
2. January 2026 figure (19) confirms a sluggish start and ongoing engine constraints (primary Airbus data + CEO remarks).

Moderate
3. Analyst consensus of ~880-900 jets for the full year (two independent financial sources, consistent with IBA).
4. New A320 final-assembly lines in Tianjin/Toulouse scheduled to ramp during H1-26 (company statements) – positive but timing uncertain.

Weak
5. Stock-price movements and India/Helicopter news – tangential to April single-month deliveries.

(c) Time-frame analysis
Outcome known c. 75 days from now (early May). If the horizon were halved (≈5 weeks), I would widen tails only slightly – production lead-times >4 weeks are largely baked in. If doubled (≈5 months), tail risks from new quality snags or surprise engine catch-up would grow, so I would widen both tails and leave the mean unchanged.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments
Base-rate (outside view) used 930 full-year deliveries × 7.7 % April share → 72 aircraft with 10-90 range 45-88.

Inside-view shifts
Downward pressures (−):
• January deliveries down 27 % YoY (19 vs 26), pointing to continuing engine shortages and start-up hiccups (strong evidence).
• CEO explicitly flags engines as “trickiest parts” (strong corroboration).
• New Tianjin/Toulouse lines unlikely to feed customer-accepted aircraft before late Q2 (moderate).

Upward pressures (+):
• Glider inventory from late-2025 could convert into deliveries rapidly once engines arrive (moderate).
• Industry consensus still sees 880-900 aircraft this year, only ≈10 % below my earlier 930 assumption (moderate).

Net effect: trim full-year baseline to 900 and assume April share skewed slightly lower (6.8 % rather than 7.7 %), giving a central estimate ≈ 61. Round to 62 for the median. Widen lower tail a bit more than upper because downside shocks (fresh quality halt) historically larger.

Distribution calibration
Mean ~63, median ~62.
10th: 42   (severe new stoppage; April share 4.7 %)
20th: 50   (persistent engine shortage; share 5.6 %)
40th: 58   (sluggish but improving; share 6.4 %)
60th: 66   (mildly below trend; share 7.3 %)
80th: 77   (smooth execution + some glider catch-up; share 8.6 %)
90th: 88   (very strong month; share 9.8 %, near historical max)

Checklist:
1. Variable: count of Airbus commercial aircraft delivered in April 2026, per monthly Orders & Deliveries PDF.
2. Outside-view distribution anchored at 45-88 with median ≈ 65; final distribution remains centred there but nudged lower to reflect weak Jan.
3. Implied median = 62; mean ≈ 63 – consistent with justification and historical ranges.
4. Key evidence: a) 19 Jan deliveries (low); b) CEO remarks on engine issues; c) 2022-25 April ≈7-8 % rule; d) analyst 880-900 FY-26 forecast; e) ramp-up of new lines.
5. Blind-spot: sudden large engine delivery clearance in late March could push April above 90 (upside).
6. Status-quo bias checked – April count remains within normal (40-90) historical band.
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, units = aircraft, all within open upper bound.
