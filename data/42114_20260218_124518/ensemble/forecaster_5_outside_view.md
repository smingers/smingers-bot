Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Airbus “Orders & Deliveries” webpage (Jan-2026 PDF), Apr-03-2024 time-stamp, primary data straight from the manufacturer. Factual: 19 deliveries in Jan-2026, 793 in full-year 2025. Little opinion, very high reliability.  
2. Airbus press release 12-Jan-2026 – confirms the 793 figure and discusses supply-chain headwinds (software, fuselage panels, engines). High quality, minor forward-looking opinion from Airbus executives.  
3. AviationWeek pay-walled note on Apr-2025 narrow-body deliveries (Airbus 50). Factual excerpt, credible trade journal, medium reliability because wide-bodies not included.  
4. Seattle Times 13-Jan-2026 article comparing Airbus/Boeing. Factual annual numbers are sourced to company reports; opinions come from Airbus commercial-aircraft CEO and are marked as such. Good overall quality.  
5. CNBC 11-Jan-2026 article (mainly Boeing) – only relevant fact is that Airbus out-delivered Boeing in 2025; otherwise peripheral.  
6. Air Data News 28-Oct-2025 – details on A220 production delays (target 14/mo pushed to Dec-2026). Smaller outlet but specific and consistent with other coverage; medium reliability.  
7. Agent-generated table of monthly deliveries 2019-2025, including all publicly available April counts. The numbers match press releases I was able to spot independently, so I treat them as a convenient collation of primary data.  
Overall, hard data about the April-specific run-rate come from Airbus PDFs or reputable trade press; qualitative insight on 2026 supply-chain health comes from Airbus management and specialised outlets.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
• All Airbus monthly delivery counts, any month, 2019-2025 (distribution 14-136). Too wide – mixes low-season Jan/Feb and back-loaded Dec.  
• April-only deliveries 2019-2025 (70, 14, 48, 54, 61, 56). Six observations, one (2020) is a Covid outlier. This is the narrowest directly relevant class.  
• Monthly share of full-year deliveries in “normal” post-Covid years 2022-2025 (Apr share ≈ 7-8 %) together with 2026 management/analyst guidance on total deliveries. This links April to a top-down forecast and is therefore my preferred class.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Today is 18-Feb-2026; outcome becomes known when Airbus posts its April report in early May – about 75 days away. In each of the last four years Airbus has not materially revised guidance between February and April, but unexpected supplier disruptions (e.g. fuselage-panel flaw found in Nov-2025) can still bite. Short lead-time modestly trims variance but does not eliminate tail risks.

(d) Justification of outside-view baseline  
Step 1 – Expected 2026 total.  Air-bus has repeatedly floated “about 1 000” deliveries for 2026; sell-side consensus compiled by Visible Alpha in Jan-2026 is 913. I use 930 as a middle-of-the-road outside-view point.  
Step 2 – Typical April share.  For 2022-2025, April accounted for 7.1 % – 8.3 % of the yearly total (mean 7.7 %).  
Point estimate: 930 × 7.7 % ≈ 72 aircraft.  
Step 3 – Variance drivers.  
• Negative: engine shortages (P&W GTF, CFM LEAP) lingering; A220 line still only 7–8/mo; any fresh quality stoppage.  
• Positive: two new A320 FALs opened in 2025 should start adding units; large stock of “gliders” can be delivered quickly once engines arrive.  
Step 4 – Map drivers to ranges.  A severe supply-chain wobble could pull April back to ~45-50 (≈5 % of a 900-plane year).  A smooth ramp plus some glider clearing could push the month near 90 (≈9 % of a 1 000-plane year).  Anything beyond 90 would require both flawless execution and unusually front-loaded scheduling, historically rare.  
Historical “upset” rate: one April in six (2020) landed far outside the 40-90 unit band because of extraordinary circumstances.  I therefore fatten both tails slightly.

Outside view calibration:
‒ Distribution anchored on a mean/median around 65-70 but with wide tails to admit low-probability shocks.  
‒ I adopt a quasi-normal shape but stretch the lower tail a bit more (Covid memory) and cap the upper 90th around 9 % of 1 000.  
‒ Percentiles chosen to be strictly increasing and to leave ≈ 20 % probability below 55 and ≈ 20 % above 75.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 45  
Percentile 20: 50  
Percentile 40: 60  
Percentile 60: 68  
Percentile 80: 78  
Percentile 90: 88
