- Booked 368 orders for Dreamliner (highest since 2007)
- Booked 158 orders for 777X from January through November 2025

### 2025 Challenges for Airbus:

**A320 Disruptions:**
- November: Software issue identified related to "intense solar radiation" potentially corrupting critical flight control data, requiring modifications to about 4,000 planes already in service
- December: Supplier quality issue discovered on A320 forward fuselage panels, requiring heavy inspections and slowing production

**Engine Supply Issues:**
- Pratt & Whitney geared turbofan engine delays for A320
- At peak, Airbus had 60 nearly finished planes ("gliders") waiting on engines

## Named Source Opinions:

**Christian Scherer (outgoing CEO of Airbus commercial aircraft):**
- Said A320 issues from late 2025 won't carry into 2026
- Acknowledged supply chain constraints, primarily around engine availability, but stated "the overall situation … is much brighter now"
- Declined to specify current number of "gliders" but said it's "very manageable right now"
- Said engine issues did not prevent Airbus from hitting delivery targets in 2025; blamed the A320 fuselage panel quality issue for missing the 820-plane target
- Stated Airbus wasn't intimidated by Boeing's political backing: "What it means for us is that we just have to be more convincing than our competitor"
- Characterized missed delivery targets as a sign of ambition rather than failure: "I'd rather be on the ambitious side because the demand for our products is so strong"

**Benoît de Saint-Exupéry (executive vice president of sales for Airbus commercial aircraft):**
- Said the A321 XLR "fully spread its wings" in 2025 with five new operators

### 2026 and Beyond Production Plans:

**Airbus:**
- Plans to increase monthly A320 production to 75 by 2027
- Opened two new A320 final assembly lines in 2025 (China and Mobile, Alabama)
- Opened new facility for A321 XLR

**Boeing:**
- FAA lifted 737 MAX production cap in October 2025 (from 38 to 42 monthly)
- Plans to continue increasing 737 monthly production in increments of about six months between rate hikes
- Focus in 2026 on achieving FAA certification for three new plane models (two MAX variants and 777X family)

## Context:
- Airbus has delivered more planes than Boeing for the seventh year in a row
- In October 2025, the A320 family surpassed Boeing's 737 as the most-delivered commercial plane in history

– January 2025 has been corrected to the official 25 units; earlier placeholders for Feb–Mar 2025 are removed pending verification.

2026 delivery guidance  
• Airbus reiterated on 25 Oct 2025 that it is “working toward about 1,000 commercial aircraft deliveries in 2026”, driven chiefly by the A320-family ramp-up to rate 75 per month by 2027 (Simple Flying, 25 Oct 2025).  
• Equity-research consensus, compiled by Visible Alpha, stands at 913 deliveries for 2026, with Berenberg at 890 (Finimize, 12 Jan 2026).  
• Formal numeric guidance will be issued with FY-2025 results on 19 Feb 2026 (Airbus investor calendar, Jan 2025).  

Supply-chain commentary relevant to 2026 outlook  
1. Engines: Persistent shortages of Pratt & Whitney GTF and CFM LEAP spares left 17 completed A320-family jets awaiting power-plants in April 2025 (AeroTime, 8 May 2025).  
2. Spirit AeroSystems: Structural quality problems affecting A350 and A220 fuselage sections; Airbus’ planned takeover of selected Spirit work packages (closing Q4 2025) is expected to normalise flow from 2026 onward (Airbus HY-2025 results, 30 Jul 2025).  
3. Fuselage-panel defect at another supplier forced a trim of 2025 guidance from 820 to ~790 (Finimize, 12 Jan 2026), illustrating exposure to Tier-1 disruptions.  
4. Delivery profile remains back-end-loaded – 17 % of all 2025 deliveries occurred in December alone (FlightGlobal, 26 Jan 2026) – suggesting that any April 2026 figure will depend heavily on how quickly suppliers support the planned first-half acceleration.  

Remaining information gaps  
• Monthly Airbus PDFs (January 2019–December 2025) would allow the table to be completed, in particular April 2021 and all missing months for 2021-2025.  
• Airbus’ explicit numeric target for 2026, due 19 Feb 2026.  

Nevertheless, the dataset above captures every April delivery figure now available in open sources and compiles the most recent guidance and supply-chain context required to frame forecasts for April 2026 deliveries.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
