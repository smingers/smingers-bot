Analysis:
To estimate April 2026 deliveries we need the most up-to-date hard numbers (January 2026 actual deliveries; any preliminary February figures) plus qualitative coverage of production-rate guidance, supply-chain constraints, and engine availability affecting the A320/A220 ramps. Relevant articles will appear in financial and aerospace trade press, Airbus press releases, and analyst notes published in the last few weeks. Therefore I’ll search for: 1) the latest “Orders & Deliveries” data, 2) news discussing 2026 delivery targets and monthly cadence, and 3) broader context on production issues that could move April figures up or down.
