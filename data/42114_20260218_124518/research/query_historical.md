Analysis:
To build an outside-view for April-2026 deliveries I need:
• Historical monthly delivery counts from Airbus “Orders & Deliveries” – especially the months of April in 2021-2025 and the YTD pattern each year.  
• News or analyst commentary on Airbus’ current production-rate ramp (A320 family increase toward 75/mo, A350 toward 10/mo, supply-chain constraints, engine shortages) that could affect spring-2026 throughput.  
• Airbus’ own 2026 delivery guidance and any recent revisions (earnings call, press release, CFO interviews).  
These three strands—seasonal history, recent monthly run-rate, and forward-looking production guidance—form the key historical context for a quantitative forecast.
