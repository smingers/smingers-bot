He emphasized that India is Airbus' fastest-growing aviation market and a 'material country' for the company. Westermeier praised the Indian government's leadership in promoting the aviation sector, particularly citing Prime Minister Narendra Modi's UDAN scheme as a key enabler for regional air connectivity. Airbus has a significant presence in India, employing over 3,600 people and supporting more than 15,000 jobs through its supply chain. The company sources over EUR 1 billion annually in components and services from India for global exports. Airbus first entered India\u2019s commercial aviation market in 1976, and today its aircraft account for approximately 72% of the domestic commercial aviation market.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 11:45 AM\nSource:[MoneyControl](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/ai-summit-airbus-india-president-westermeier-reveals-1-300-aircraft-delivery-plan-for-india-over-next-decade-13834374.html)\n\n**Airbus is trading 2.48 percent higher with a volume of EUR 203.8 mn on Wednesday 18th of February**\nAirbus (AIR.PA) rose 2.48% in a 24-hour period ending at 05:02 AM Central Europe on Wednesday, February 18, 2026, with trading volume reaching EUR 203.8 million. The stock was priced at approximately EUR 197.2 per share, with a total supply of 789.4 million shares and a current market capitalization of EUR 155.7 billion. Since the end of the previous month, Airbus has declined by 6.27%. The 200-day simple moving average stands at EUR 188.9. The 52-week high was EUR 221.3, recorded on January 14, 2026, while the 52-week low was EUR 126.4, recorded on April 7, 2025.

Airbus, despite ongoing supply chain constraints, achieved 793 commercial aircraft deliveries in 2025\u201493 A220s, 607 A320 family aircraft, and 57 A350s\u2014meeting most of its targets. The company's 2026 goals include increasing A320neo and A321XLR production, accelerating A350F cargo aircraft deliveries, and achieving annual delivery leadership over Boeing. Key challenges include engine issues with Pratt & Whitney-powered A320 family aircraft and a dust-related production problem that grounded dozens of planes, affecting airlines like Turkish Airlines (THY), which still has A320 family aircraft on the ground. Despite a fuselage panel quality issue in late 2025 that reduced production plans, delivery targets were not significantly missed. In 2025, Airbus secured 1,000 gross (889 net) new orders: 49 A220s, 656 A320s, 100 A330neos, 2 A330 MRTTs, and 193 A350s. Total backlog reached 8,754 aircraft, with 1,124 wide-body orders. Airbus plans to launch its second A320 line in Tianjin, China, in October 2025 and fully ramp it up by early 2026, convert the former A380 line in Toulouse into a second A321 line by mid-2026, and increase A350 production to 12 aircraft per month by 2028. The company aims to resolve engine-related issues quickly and continue its hydrogen and ZEROe projects without delay. Meanwhile, Boeing delivered 600 aircraft in 2024 and completed 46 deliveries in the first five weeks of the year, securing 107 orders. Airbus delivered 19 aircraft and secured 49 orders in the same period. Competition is intensifying, but this is positive as global demand for aircraft grows and aging fleets are retired faster. SunExpress, a Turkish-German joint venture, appointed Marcus Schnabel as its new CEO, effective February 1, 2026. Schnabel, a German national with over 20 years of experience in aviation operations, safety, and strategic transformation, is a licensed commercial pilot who previously flew A320, A330, A340, and A350 aircraft for Lufthansa. He holds degrees in business administration from Ludwig Maximilian University and FernUniversit\u00e4t Hagen and completed the Advanced Management Program at IESE Business School. SunExpress operates 237 routes across 35 countries, with hubs in Antalya and Frankfurt, and serves approximately 15 million passengers in 2024\u2014up from 10.7 million in 2022. It has been named Europe\u2019s Best Leisure Airline by Skytrax in 2023 and 2024, and carries half of all German-Turkish travelers. The airline has increased its capacity in the UK and Ireland by fourfold since 2022 and has trained 200 pilots, with plans to train another 200 in five years.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 04:01 AM\nSource:[H\u00fcrriyet](https://www.hurriyet.com.tr/yazarlar/ugur-cebeci/tedarik-zinciri-celme-takiyor-43110658)\n\n**Airbus Helicopters Launches First H125 Assembly Line in India, Marking Over 60 Years of Indo-French Aviation Partnership**\nAirbus Helicopters has maintained a partnership with India for over 60 years, marked by the inauguration of its first dedicated assembly line in Vemagal, near Bangalore, for the H125 (formerly Ecureuil) helicopter. The site, virtually inaugurated by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron from Mumbai, will be operational by April 2026, with the first 'Made in India' H125 flight expected before year-end and deliveries beginning by April 2027. The assembly line is managed by India's Tata Group, which will employ 500 people and also produce the military version of the H125, aligning with India's plan to purchase 200 light reconnaissance and surveillance helicopters. This follows Airbus\u2019s existing C295 military transport aircraft assembly line in Vadodara, operated with Tata Advanced Systems, producing 40 of 56 ordered aircraft, with the first delivery in September 2026. Airbus, which has over 3,800 employees in India\u2014mostly in Bangalore\u2014describes the collaboration as a 'win-win,' citing India\u2019s strong ecosystem, skilled workforce, and strategic role in enhancing Airbus\u2019s global resilience. The company reported $1.5 billion in component and service purchases from India in 2025, delivered 392 helicopters globally in 2025 (up 8.6% year-on-year), and secured 536 net orders, becoming the top-ranked manufacturer in the military helicopter market in terms of orders, with a 28% market share (up from 19% in 2024). Airbus holds 40% of the civil helicopter market in South Asia and aims to expand further. India seeks to reduce its status as the world\u2019s top arms importer and achieve 70% domestic military equipment production by the end of the decade.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 01:22 PM\nSource:[Orange Actualit\u00e9s](https://actu.orange.fr/economie/entre-l-inde-et-airbus-helicopters-plus-de-60-ans-d-histoire-CNT000002np2pn.html)\n\n**Between India and Airbus Helicopters, Over 60 Years of History**\nAirbus Helicopters and India have shared over 60 years of aerospace collaboration, marked by the virtual inauguration of the first H125 helicopter assembly line in Vemagal, near Bangalore, by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and French President Emmanuel Macron. The facility, operated by India\u2019s Tata Group and set to become operational in April 2026, will produce both civil and military versions of the H125 Ecureuil, with the first 'Made in India' H125 expected to fly before year-end and deliveries planned by April 2027. The site will employ 500 people and supports India\u2019s goal to manufacture 70% of its military equipment by 2030. Airbus already operates a C295 military transport aircraft assembly line in Vadodara with Tata Advanced Systems, producing 40 of 56 ordered aircraft, with the first delivery in September 2026. Airbus has over 3,800 employees in India, primarily in Bangalore, and spent $1.5 billion on Indian components and services in 2025. The company sold 544 helicopters globally in 2025, a 20% increase from 2024, driven by military orders and drone integration. Airbus Helicopters recorded 536 net orders and delivered 392 helicopters, achieving first place in the military market with a 28% market share (up from 19% in 2024). The H125 production in India is expected to boost helicopter usage across civil and military sectors in the world\u2019s most populous nation. Airbus, a top three global helicopter manufacturer, holds 40% of the civil market in South Asia and aims to strengthen resilience amid geopolitical uncertainty, citing India\u2019s strong ecosystem and skilled workforce. The partnership is described as a 'win-win' by Jocelyn Gaudin, Airbus\u2019s Bangalore innovation center head. The collaboration began in 1962 with a licensing agreement with India\u2019s Hindustan Aeronautics Limited (HAL) to produce the Alouette III, later expanded to include the Lama, with over 650 helicopters built since 1965\u2014most still in service for troop transport and logistics.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 01:02 PM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/97UY466)\n\n**The End Of The 615-Seat Giant: Emirates To Retire World's Densest Airbus A380**\nEmirates is retiring its 615-seat Airbus A380 configuration, the world's highest-capacity operational passenger aircraft, by November 2026. The 15 aircraft currently configured with 58 business seats, 557 economy seats, and no first class will be retrofitted to a new three-class layout with 76 business seats, 56 premium economy seats, and 437 economy seats, reducing total capacity from 615 to 569 seats. This change, driven by the rollout of premium economy as a standard offering on new A350s, increases business class by 31% and raises the share of non-economy seats from 9% to 23% when premium economy is included. The first two reconfigured aircraft are expected to be operational by mid-April 2026, with full completion by November. The debut route for the new 569-seater is Dubai to Amman (EK903/EK904), scheduled for April 14, 2026, though it may be delayed. Prague will become the first longer-haul route to operate the new configuration, starting June 1, 2026, marking the first time Emirates introduces premium economy on that route. The move reflects a strategic shift toward higher yields and improved cabin flexibility, aligning the A380 fleet with newer aircraft standards. British Airways is also reducing A380 capacity, from 469 to 421 seats.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 12:21 PM\nSource:[Simple Flying](https://simpleflying.com/the-end-of-the-615-seat-giant-emirates-to-retire-worlds-densest-airbus-a380/)\n\n**Lufthansa: New Business-Class Seats on Dreamliner Now Bookable \u2013 What\u2019s Known**\nLufthansa has announced that it will begin selling tickets for 25 Business-Class seats on its Boeing 787 Dreamliners starting April 15, 2026, following a prolonged certification delay that left 24 of the 28 Business-Class seats unusable since the cabin's introduction. The delay stemmed from the complex cabin layout of the 787, which features five different seat configurations\u2014including enclosed, partially enclosed, and fully capped seats\u2014making it difficult to prove passenger evacuation safety in emergencies to aviation authorities. As a result, only four first-row Business-Class suites were available for sale for months, causing significant revenue loss during a critical phase of Lufthansa\u2019s multi-year recovery plan. To avoid further delays, the airline opted to use an already-certified Business-Class seat for its Airbus A380 fleet. The 25 seats now available include Classic, Privacy, Extra Space, and Extra Long Bed configurations, with the latter offering over two meters of lie-flat space. Three seats in the second row remain locked due to ongoing certification issues. Lufthansa plans to operate eight All\u00e9gris-equipped Dreamliners by mid-2026, with routes to Rio de Janeiro, Bogot\u00e1, Cape Town, Shanghai, Hyderabad, Hong Kong, Austin, New York-JFK, Los Angeles, and Delhi. The All\u00e9gris cabin concept will also be integrated into the existing A350 and 747-8 fleets and future Boeing 777X aircraft, though the 747\u2019s upper deck will retain its original configuration, resulting in a split Business-Class layout.

Previously, only four seats had been approved by the U.S. Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). The delay was due to the need for additional certification of the custom Allegris cabin interior, which differs from standard configurations. Lufthansa stated that 'important milestones' have been reached in the prolonged review process, though full certification remains pending. Three seats in the second row of Business-Class remain temporarily restricted. The first 787 with the Allegris cabin has been in service since October 2025, operating from Frankfurt.

Currently, nearly one-third of Airbus\u2019s global revenue and order backlog comes from the Asia-Pacific region, where an estimated 19,560 new passenger aircraft will be needed over the next 20 years\u2014accounting for 46% of global demand. Investors are particularly interested in market-specific strategies, such as in India, and the competitive threat from China\u2019s Comac. Additionally, Airbus, Leonardo, and Thales announced in October a joint venture to launch a new space and satellite company in 2027, aimed at strengthening Europe\u2019s strategic autonomy in space. On aircraft deliveries, Airbus reduced its 2024 target from around 820 to 790 aircraft due to quality issues with A320 fuselage panels, ultimately delivering 793 aircraft. Prior years faced delays from engine and cabin component shortages. For 2026, analysts remain cautious due to ongoing engine supply constraints and project a delivery target of approximately 880 aircraft\u201411% higher than 2024. The article includes a summary of analyst forecasts for the fourth quarter and full year 2025.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 02:15 PM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/ausblick-fokus-bei-airbus-auf-a320-produktion-und-auslieferungziel-ce7e5dd8d981f622)\n\n**Airbus Delivers Nearly 800 Commercial Aircraft in 2025, Records New Order Milestone**\nAirbus, headquartered in Toulouse, reported its 2025 results on January 12, 2026. The company delivered 793 commercial aircraft in 2025, a 4% increase from 2024 and in line with its revised forecast (originally projected at 820 aircraft). However, this figure remains below the 863 aircraft delivered in 2019, considered a pre-pandemic benchmark. Deliveries were distributed among 91 clients. The backlog of orders reached a record high of 8,754 aircraft by the end of December 2025, with 1,000 new orders placed during the year\u2014656 of which were for A320 family aircraft. The largest pending order was from Vietjet Air, which ordered 100 A321neo aircraft.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 12, 2026 05:37 PM\nSource:[actu.fr](https://actu.fr/occitanie/toulouse_31555/toulouse-airbus-a-livre-pres-de-800-avions-commerciaux-en-2025-des-milliers-d-appareils-en-commande_63688611.html)\n\n**Airbus beats revised delivery goal with 793 aircraft in 2025**\nAirbus delivered 793 commercial aircraft to customers worldwide in 2025, a 4% increase from the previous year, surpassing its revised delivery target despite ongoing supply chain constraints and production challenges. The company exceeded adjusted expectations, with deliveries outpacing its updated goal. A record backlog of 8,754 aircraft underscores sustained strong demand across its product portfolio. Growth was primarily driven by single-aisle jets, particularly the A320 family, while widebody deliveries remained stable, reflecting continued long-haul demand as evidenced by a record widebody backlog. The results reflect stable production output and year-over-year growth.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 12, 2026 05:14 PM\nSource:[Seeking Alpha](https://seekingalpha.com/news/4538524-airbus-beats-revised-delivery-goal-with-793-aircraft-in-2025)\n\n**Airbus Exceeds Revised 2025 Delivery Target, Reaching 793 Aircraft Deliveries**\nAccording to a Bloomberg report on January 3, 2026, Airbus delivered a total of 793 commercial aircraft in 2025, exceeding its revised annual delivery target. The company increased its delivery pace toward the end of the year to achieve this goal. This follows a prior revision of its annual target from approximately 820 aircraft to approximately 790 aircraft, which was prompted by the discovery of defects in the fuselage panels of its main aircraft model last month.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 05, 2026 01:48 AM\nSource:[\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u65e5\u672c\u7248 \u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8](https://www.newsweekjapan.jp/headlines/business/2026/01/583057.php)\n\n**Airbus to issue data on Jan 12 as delivery confidence grows**\nAirbus confirmed on January 2, 2026, that it would release audited end-year commercial data on January 12, 2026, signaling increased confidence in its revised 2025 delivery target of 'around 790' aircraft.

In September, the company delivered 73 aircraft, bringing the total to 507 for the first nine months of the year, still below the 820 goal. Delays earlier in the year were primarily due to late delivery of engines to Airbus assembly plants, which caused a backlog of up to 60 partially assembled aircraft waiting for engines\u2014now reduced. An executive stated, 'Creemos que lo podemos conseguir,' expressing confidence in achieving the target. In 2024, Airbus delivered 766 aircraft, falling short of its revised target of 770, which had been lowered mid-year due to supply chain bottlenecks. The company is increasing production cadence, particularly for its A320 single-aisle family, aiming to produce 75 units per month by 2027. Additionally, the integration of Spirit's assets\u2014acquired in the Boeing-Airbus asset division\u2014should be completed by the fourth quarter of 2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 06:29 PM\nSource:[Portafolio.co](https://www.portafolio.co/negocios/empresas/airbus-percibe-mejoras-y-espera-cumplir-su-meta-de-entregar-820-aviones-en-2025-642021)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
