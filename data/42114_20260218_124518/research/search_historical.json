Engines: Persistent shortages of Pratt & Whitney GTF and CFM LEAP spares left 17 completed A320-family jets awaiting power-plants in April 2025 (AeroTime, 8 May 2025).  \n2. Spirit AeroSystems: Structural quality problems affecting A350 and A220 fuselage sections; Airbus\u2019 planned takeover of selected Spirit work packages (closing Q4 2025) is expected to normalise flow from 2026 onward (Airbus HY-2025 results, 30 Jul 2025).  \n3. Fuselage-panel defect at another supplier forced a trim of 2025 guidance from 820 to ~790 (Finimize, 12 Jan 2026), illustrating exposure to Tier-1 disruptions.  \n4. Delivery profile remains back-end-loaded \u2013 17 % of all 2025 deliveries occurred in December alone (FlightGlobal, 26 Jan 2026) \u2013 suggesting that any April 2026 figure will depend heavily on how quickly suppliers support the planned first-half acceleration.  \n\nRemaining information gaps  \n\u2022 Monthly Airbus PDFs (January 2019\u2013December 2025) would allow the table to be completed, in particular April 2021 and all missing months for 2021-2025.  \n\u2022 Airbus\u2019 explicit numeric target for 2026, due 19 Feb 2026.  \n\nNevertheless, the dataset above captures every April delivery figure now available in open sources and compiles the most recent guidance and supply-chain context required to frame forecasts for April 2026 deliveries.</Agent_report>\n"
