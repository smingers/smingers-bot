Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

1. **Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl** (Official Dutch election results website): Lists recent elections but doesn't show historical municipal election results in the excerpt. This is the primary authoritative source specified in the resolution criteria. High quality, official government data.

2. **Data.overheid.nl request** (2024): Administrative request for turnout data, not relevant to vote shares. No useful information for this question.

3. **Geopolitique.eu article** (March 2022): Discusses 2022 municipal elections. Reports local parties obtained ~11.7% in 1986, grew to 25% plurality in 2002, and continued growing through 2022. The article is cut off but indicates local parties grew further in 2022 vs 2018. Quality appears moderate; provides historical context but incomplete data.

4. **IamExpat article** (March 17, 2022): Reports 2022 municipal election results. States local parties won approximately 36% nationwide, up from 29% in 2018. PvdA received 17% nationwide. High relevance; provides specific nationwide figures for the #1 party type.

5. **Omroepwest.nl article** (October 18, 2025): Discusses campaign challenges for 2026 municipal elections due to snap national elections. Contains opinions from local politicians about election fatigue and local party advantages. Michel Vermeer notes trust in local parties is growing. Moderate quality; mostly forward-looking opinions rather than hard data.

6. **ProDemos article** (October 28, 2025): About mock student elections for national parliament, not municipal elections. Not relevant to this question.

7. **Maurice de Hond blog** (February 14, 2026 - 5 days ago): Analyzes historical patterns and makes predictions for March 18, 2026 elections. Reports local parties scored 37% (2018) and 41% (2022) in small municipalities, around 20% in large municipalities. Maurice de Hond is a well-known Dutch pollster and political analyst, making his opinions more credible than anonymous sources. Predicts D66 will rise significantly, GroenLinks/PvdA and VVD will lose, turnout 50-55%.

8. **Agent report**: Provides crucial official data from Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl:
   - 2010: Lokale partijen 23.66% (#1 party, >15%)
   - 2022: Lokale partijen 31.28% (#1 party, >15%)
   - Notes 2014 (~27%) and 2018 (~32%) also had local parties as #1, both >15%
   
This is the most critical source as it provides official nationwide results showing the historical pattern.

**Key factual findings:**
- Local parties (Lokale partijen) have been the #1 nationwide party in every municipal election from 2010-2022
- Their vote shares: 2010 (23.66%), 2014 (~27%), 2018 (~32%), 2022 (31.28%)
- All exceeded the 15% threshold by substantial margins (8-16 percentage points)
- The trend shows growth from 2010 to 2018, with a slight decline in 2022 but still above 31%

(b) Reference class analysis:

Possible reference classes:
1. **Dutch municipal elections 2010-2022**: Most directly relevant. Shows consistent pattern of local parties exceeding 15% as the #1 party.
2. **Dutch municipal elections since 2002**: Broader historical view showing local parties became plurality in 2002 at 25%, suggesting long-term dominance.
3. **Recent European municipal elections**: Too broad and different political systems make comparison difficult.

**Selected reference class**: Dutch municipal elections 2010-2022 (4 elections). This is the most suitable because:
- Same electoral system and context
- Recent enough to reflect current political fragmentation
- Provides consistent data on the specific metric (nationwide #1 party vote share)

(c) Timeframe analysis:

- **Prediction timeframe**: 28 days from today (Feb 19, 2026) until the March 18, 2026 election
- **Resolution timeframe**: Until May 1, 2026 (when official results should be available)

Historical pattern over 12-year period (4 elections):
- 2010: 23.66% (local parties #1)
- 2014: ~27% (local parties #1)
- 2018: ~32% (local parties #1)
- 2022: 31.28% (local parties #1)

The pattern shows:
- 100% consistency: local parties were #1 in all 4 elections
- 100% exceeded 15%: all 4 elections cleared the threshold by 8-16 percentage points
- Growth trend 2010-2018, slight decline in 2022 but still very high
- Lowest margin above 15% was 8.66 percentage points (2010)

(d) Justification:

The outside view strongly suggests the answer will be "Yes":

1. **Perfect historical record**: In every municipal election 2010-2022, the #1 party (local parties) exceeded 15% by substantial margins.

2. **Structural advantages of local parties**: The fragmentation of Dutch politics at the municipal level favors local parties. With 45% of voters in municipalities under 50,000 inhabitants where local parties score 37-41%, and national parties splitting the vote among many competitors, local parties have a structural advantage.

3. **Recent trends**: The 2022 result (31.28%) is more than double the 15% threshold, providing a large buffer. Even if local parties decline significantly, they would need to lose more than half their support to fall below 15%.

4. **Expert opinion**: Maurice de Hond (credible pollster) doesn't predict any dramatic shifts that would threaten local parties' dominance. He expects D66 to rise and GL-PvdA/VVD to fall, but these are all national parties competing with each other.

5. **Low upset rate**: In 4 consecutive elections spanning different political contexts, the pattern held perfectly. This suggests very low probability of upset.

**Potential risks to "Yes" outcome**:
- Unprecedented consolidation of national party votes around one party
- Dramatic shift in voter behavior in the 28 days remaining
- However, Maurice de Hond's recent analysis (5 days ago) shows no indication of such shifts

Outside view calibration:

(a) **True probability assessment**: The historical record is extremely strong - 4/4 elections with substantial margins. This is not a close call requiring hedging.

(b) **Rough figure to tether to**: The lowest historical result was 23.66% in 2010, still 8.66 percentage points above the 15% threshold. The most recent result was 31.28% in 2022.

(c) **Probability granularity**: 
- 90% (9:1 odds) would mean 1 in 10 chance of falling below 15%
- 95% (19:1 odds) would mean 1 in 20 chance
- 98% (49:1 odds) would mean 1 in 50 chance

(d) **Rate of upsets**: In this specific domain (Dutch municipal elections, #1 party vote share), there have been zero upsets in the reference class. The pattern has held through various national political contexts (different governing coalitions, rise of new parties like PVV, FvD, BBB). This suggests upsets are rare.

Given:
- Perfect 4/4 historical record
- Substantial margins (minimum 8.66 pp above threshold)
- Structural advantages for local parties
- No evidence of dramatic shifts in recent polling/analysis
- Only 28 days until election (limited time for major changes)

The probability should be very high but not absolute. There's always some possibility of unprecedented events (major scandal, dramatic consolidation, measurement error). However, the evidence strongly points to >95% probability.

A 2-3% chance of upset seems appropriate given the perfect historical record but acknowledging some irreducible uncertainty.
