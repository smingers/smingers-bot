Analysis:
1) Resolution-aligned paraphrase  
Resolves “Yes” if, in the official nationwide (landelijk) municipal election results on verkiezingsuitslagen.nl reported before May 1, 2026, the party/category with the highest nationwide vote share is ≥15.0%.

(a) Source analysis (summary, quality, date, fact vs opinion)
- Outside-view historical municipal results (Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl via prior compilation): High-quality/official historical fact base for 2010–2022. Key factual claim used: the nationwide #1 has been “Lokale partijen” with vote shares well above 15% each cycle.
- IamExpat (Mar 2022, referenced in outside view): Reputable expat-news outlet; secondary reporting. Factual claim: local parties ~36% in 2022; PvdA ~17%. Useful but less authoritative than the official site.
- Geopolitique.eu (Mar 2022, referenced): Analytical/academic tone; good for context (turnout, fragmentation), but not the primary vote-share source.
- Maurice de Hond blog (Feb 14, 2026, referenced): Identifiable Dutch pollster/analyst. This is expert opinion/forecasting, not official results. Useful directional insight about expected relative performance (local parties strong in smaller municipalities; D66 up; others down), but should be treated as probabilistic.
- PolitPro polling trend (current, general elections): Aggregated polling for national elections (not municipal). Methodology seems systematic; still only indirectly relevant. Fact: D66 ~19% in national polling; PVV ~15%; VVD ~13%.
- Friedrich Naumann Foundation (Feb 10, 2026): Think-tank style political analysis; plausibly factual on government formation (minority govt led by D66). Not directly about municipal vote shares; mainly context.
- Local polls/articles (Feb 2026):
  - Amsterdam O&S poll via Het Parool/AT5 (Jan 27–Feb 9 fieldwork; published Feb 18, 2026): Strong local, method-disclosed polling; relevant as an indicator in the largest city. Fact: PvdA 17.8%, GL 16.2%, D66 15.4% in Amsterdam (tight top-3).
  - Rotterdam polling (de Kanttekening, Feb 16, 2026): Secondary write-up of commissioned polls; less transparent than official O&S but still concrete numbers. Fact pattern: top parties clustered ~15–21% in Rotterdam.
  - The Hague Ipsos I&O poll (EWmagazine, Feb 2, 2026): Credible pollster named; relevant signal for large-city local-party strength. Fact: Hart voor Den Haag ~1/3 locally (dominant in The Hague).
- EenVandaag survey summary (NLTimes/welingelichtekringen, Feb 18, 2026): Indicates many new local parties, some motivated by asylum-shelter politics. This is factual survey reporting (still secondhand), relevant to fragmentation and local-list supply.
- Ballot paper trial (NOS/NRC, Dec 2025–Feb 2026): High-quality reporting. Mostly operational; marginal relevance to nationwide top party share (could slightly affect invalid votes but unlikely to drive the top party below 15%).

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence:
- Historical municipal-election pattern (2010–2022): the nationwide #1 vote share has been far above 15% every time (min ~23.7% in 2010 per the outside view). Structural persistence: local lists are deeply embedded in municipal politics and aggregate nationally as “Lokale partijen” on the official nationwide table. This is the core driver.
- Structural fragmentation/localism: continued proliferation of local parties (141 new local parties in 104 municipalities per EenVandaag summary) supports the “Lokale partijen” aggregate remaining large, not shrinking toward 15%.

Moderate evidence:
- Large-city polling (Amsterdam/Rotterdam/The Hague) shows (i) no single national party dominating locally everywhere, and (ii) local parties can be very strong in some big cities (Hart voor Den Haag). This supports the view that the nationwide top party is unlikely to be a single national party barely over/under 15%; rather, the aggregated local category remains substantial.
- National political context (D66-led minority government; D66 leading national polls): could lift national parties’ municipal performance somewhat, but the Amsterdam poll also shows municipal support well below D66’s prior national peak—suggesting limited translation.

Weak evidence:
- Ballot redesign/invalid vote discussion: may shift a few tenths of a percent; not plausibly decisive for a 15% threshold.
- Turnout/engagement anecdotes (Stemwijzer launch, general “campaign has begun” quotes): could move margins locally, but unlikely to collapse the top nationwide party below 15%.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Today: 2026-02-19. Election day is 2026-03-18 (~27 days away). Resolution deadline May 1, 2026 (~71 days away).
- If timeframe were halved (≈2 weeks to election): I’d move slightly toward higher confidence because late swings rarely cut an aggregate nationwide top category from ~20–30% down below 15% without a major discontinuity.
- If timeframe were doubled (≈4–5 weeks more than now, or more uncertainty pre-election): I’d trim confidence slightly to reflect more opportunity for an unusual nationalized wave, reporting-rule quirks, or unexpected coordinated local-party collapse—still not enough to make “No” likely.

(d) Justification (inside view adjustment from outside-view base rate)
Outside view base rate was 92% based on repeated historical outcomes and wide margin to the 15% threshold.

What’s new, and does it change the reference class?
- Current signals point to *continued fragmentation* in municipal politics (many new local parties; big-city polls with 3-way races around the mid-to-high teens/low 20s). That pattern is consistent with prior municipal elections where the aggregated “Lokale partijen” category was the nationwide leader and comfortably above 15%.
- Even in Amsterdam—where national parties are relatively strong—the leading party is only ~18%, and the next two are ~16% and ~15%. This implies *no runaway national consolidation* that would plausibly suppress the top nationwide share below 15%.
- The most plausible “No” mechanism would be: (1) “Lokale partijen” cease to function as the dominant nationwide aggregate (either genuinely shrinking dramatically, or being reclassified/reported in a way that fragments them), and (2) simultaneously no national party reaches 15%. The available evidence points in the opposite direction: supply of local lists is growing, and where national parties do well, they often still cluster around the mid-teens rather than dominating nationwide.

Net: modest upward adjustment from 92% because (i) the new evidence does not challenge the core structural story, and (ii) threshold (15%) is far below the historical floor for the nationwide #1.

Probability calibration
- Outside view: 92%
- Adjustments:
  - +3 pp: Evidence of continued/local-party proliferation (EenVandaag summary) and strong local-party dominance in at least one major city (The Hague poll), reinforcing the “Lokale partijen” aggregate staying large.
  - +1 pp: Big-city polls show fragmentation rather than consolidation (reduces chance that the top nationwide party dips below 15).
  - -0 pp to -1 pp: Small residual risk of reporting/classification quirks or an unusually nationalized municipal wave.
Final inside-view probability: 96%

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Yes if the highest nationwide municipal-election vote share on verkiezingsuitslagen.nl is ≥15.0% (reported before May 1, 2026).  
2. Outside view base rate: 92%.  
3. Consistency check: 96 out of 100 times, the nationwide #1 party/category is at least 15.0%.  
4. Key evidence (most significant):
   - 2010–2022 municipal elections: nationwide #1 well above 15% every cycle (historical floor ~23.7%).  
   - Many new local parties (141 new across 104 municipalities) suggests local-list aggregate remains large.  
   - Amsterdam/Rotterdam polls: top parties in high teens/low 20s; fragmented field (no sign of sub-15 top outcome).  
   - The Hague poll: local party Hart voor Den Haag ~1/3 locally, showing local parties can still dominate.  
5. Blind-spot scenario: A change in official nationwide aggregation/reporting that effectively splits “Lokale partijen” so no single “party” clears 15%, combined with national parties all <15. This would push probability down materially (e.g., toward ~80%), but I currently view it as unlikely.  
6. Status quo outcome: Municipal elections remain fragmented with a large “Lokale partijen” aggregate; status quo favors “Yes.”

Probability: 96%
