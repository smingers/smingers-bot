Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis

1) **Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl (navigation/filter page)**
- **What it says (facts):** Merely lists recent elections (TK 2025, EP 2024, etc.) with turnout and vote totals; no municipal vote shares.
- **Quality:** Very high for official results *when on the correct municipal results pages/tables*, but this particular page is not directly informative for the question.
- **Date relevance:** Current/ongoing as an official repository; no direct signal for 2026 municipal top-party share.

2) **Data.overheid.nl data request (turnout data request)**
- **What it says (facts):** Administrative request for turnout datasets; no results/predictions.
- **Quality:** Government portal, but irrelevant to the target metric (top party vote share).
- **Date relevance:** Not useful for estimating the 2026 top-party share threshold.

3) **Geopolitique.eu article on 2022 municipal elections**
- **What it says (facts, as summarized):** 2022 had record-low turnout, record-high vote share for local parties, high fragmentation; historical note that local parties became the plurality around 2002 with ~25% and increased thereafter.
- **What it says (interpretation/opinion):** Emphasizes “striking results” framing; causal stories (e.g., media attention diverted by Ukraine war).
- **Quality:** Decent analytical secondary source; not the resolution source, and the provided excerpt is incomplete on exact 2022 percentages.
- **Date relevance:** Useful for broad historical pattern: local parties dominate municipal elections.

4) **IamExpat.nl (March 17, 2022) municipal election recap**
- **What it says (facts, but secondary):** Claims local parties ~36% nationwide; claims PvdA 17% nationwide; mentions VVD “largest overall” (which conflicts with other sources/official tables as summarized elsewhere).
- **Quality:** Popular media summary; likely based on preliminary/interpretive aggregation; not a primary/official tabulation and has internal tensions with the “Lokale partijen” framing.
- **Date relevance:** Indicates local parties and at least one national party were comfortably above 15% in 2022, but exact figures are less reliable than official tables.

5) **Omroepwest.nl (Oct 18, 2025) on campaign disruption/election fatigue**
- **What it says (facts):** Describes the impact of snap TK elections on local campaigning resources; quotes named local political actors.
- **What it says (opinions):** Claims about “election fatigue,” branding effects, and “trust in local parties is growing” are subjective assessments.
- **Quality:** Solid local journalism; useful for context, but it does not provide quantitative base rates for national top-party municipal vote share.
- **Date relevance:** Potentially relevant to turnout/engagement, but the threshold here (15%) is low relative to historical top shares.

6) **ProDemos (Oct 28, 2025) scholierenverkiezingen**
- **What it says (facts):** Mock election results among students; explicitly not predictive.
- **Quality:** Credible for what it is, but irrelevant to municipal election nationwide top-party share.

7) **Maurice de Hond (Feb 14, 2026) “Gemeenteraadsverkiezings patronen”**
- **What it says (facts mixed with claims):** Provides structural facts/claims about municipality-size distributions, turnout ranges, and past patterns by municipality size; then offers explicit *predictions* (D66 up, VVD/GL-PvdA down, etc.).
- **Quality:** De Hond is a well-known Dutch pollster/commentator; however, this is partly analysis/forecasting and not an official result source. Useful mainly for describing enduring patterns: municipal elections are structurally favorable to local lists; turnout lower than national elections.
- **Date relevance:** Very recent; more “inside view” flavored, but supports the outside-view narrative that municipal elections are systematically different and local parties are structurally strong.

8) **Agent report (compiled from Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl + secondary claims)**
- **What it says (facts, per agent):** From Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl nationwide tables:
  - 2010: “Lokale partijen” #1 at **23.66%**
  - 2022: “Lokale partijen” #1 at **31.28%**
- **What it says (unverified/secondary):** Suggests 2014 ~27% and 2018 ~32–33% for local parties, but notes these were not yet retrieved from the official nationwide tables.
- **Quality:** Mixed: the two explicit official figures (2010, 2022) are strong *if the extraction is correct*, but the middle years are not fully verified. Still, even the verified endpoints are far above 15%.
- **Date relevance:** Highly relevant because it directly addresses the top-party nationwide share in municipal elections.

**Net takeaway from sources:** The strongest, most decision-relevant historical signal is: the “Lokale partijen” aggregation appears to be the consistent nationwide #1 in municipal elections and is far above 15% in the years we have official figures for (2010 and 2022), with credible secondary indications that 2014 and 2018 were also far above 15%.

### (b) Reference class analysis

Possible reference classes:

1) **Dutch municipal elections, nationwide #1 “party” vote share (landelijk) since 2002/2006/2010**
- **Suitability:** Highest. Same country, same election type, same aggregation method used in resolution (Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl “landelijk” table), same concept of “#1 party” which in practice often means the “Lokale partijen” bloc.
- **Limitation:** Small sample size (only every 4 years). Also definitional risk: how “Lokale partijen” is grouped in the official table (but that’s precisely what the resolution uses).

2) **Other Dutch subnational elections (Provinciale Staten, Waterschap) #1 vote share**
- **Suitability:** Moderate/low. Different dynamics; local parties are less dominant; nationalization differs. Would likely *underestimate* the municipal local-list dominance.

3) **National parliamentary elections (Tweede Kamer) #1 vote share**
- **Suitability:** Low. Dutch national politics is fragmented; top party shares can be near/under 20%, but municipal elections have the special “Lokale partijen” super-category which changes the distribution.

**Chosen reference class:** Dutch municipal elections (nationwide “landelijk” #1 share), 2010–2022 (and ideally earlier if available).

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Today:** 2026-02-19  
- **Election date:** 2026-03-18  
- **Resolution deadline:** by 2026-05-01 when official nationwide results are posted/reported.
- **Time left to election:** ~27 days.  
- **Time left to resolution:** ~10 weeks.

For an outside view, short time-to-election mainly matters insofar as large structural shifts are unlikely: the dominant historical pattern (local parties as a grouped bloc) is not something that typically changes abruptly in a single cycle.

### (d) Justification (outside view)

**Baseline from history (core statistic):**
- Official nationwide tables (per agent extraction) show **“Lokale partijen”** at **23.66% (2010)** and **31.28% (2022)**—both far above the **15%** threshold.
- Secondary sources (and general knowledge reflected in the provided summaries) indicate local parties have been the plurality since at least the early 2000s and have grown in share, with 2022 described as a “good night for local parties” and “record high” local-party share.

**Why 15% is a low bar in this domain:**
- The municipal “#1 party” is not usually a single national party; it’s often the aggregated “Lokale partijen” category. That aggregation creates a very large top “party” in the nationwide table.
- Even if local parties declined substantially from ~31% (2022), they would need to more than halve to drop below 15%, *and* simultaneously no national party would exceed 15%. That combination seems historically atypical.

**Main ways “No” could happen (outside view):**
1) **A definitional/format change** where Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl no longer aggregates “Lokale partijen” into a single line item (or breaks them up), causing the largest *single* party to be a national party with a lower share that could be <15%.
2) **An extreme, unprecedented collapse** in local party voting plus unusually dispersed national party results such that the top line in the nationwide table ends up <15%.
3) **Municipal participation changes** (e.g., many local lists not running) large enough to dramatically shrink the aggregated “Lokale partijen” line.

Historically, municipal elections in the Netherlands appear to have strong continuity on this feature (local lists collectively large). So the “No” pathways look like low-probability structural/measurement disruptions rather than normal electoral variability.

Outside view calibration:

- **Tether to observed base rate:** From the (partially verified) 2010–2022 record, the #1 party was ≥15% in **2/2 officially cited cases**, and plausibly **4/4** (if 2014/2018 are confirmed similarly). Even taking the conservative stance that only 2010 and 2022 are confirmed, the observed rate is still 100% with a wide uncertainty band due to small n.
- **Upset rate adjustment:** In election forecasting, true “upsets” on broad structural metrics (like whether the top nationwide line item clears 15%) are rare, but definitional/aggregation quirks are a realistic source of error. I therefore avoid going to 99%+.
- **Overall outside-view probability:** High, because the historical top share is not near the threshold; it’s far above it. The main uncertainty is classification/aggregation rather than voter behavior.

Outside View Prediction:
**97.6%**
