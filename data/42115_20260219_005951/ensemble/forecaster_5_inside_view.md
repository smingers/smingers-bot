Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological order, most pertinent first)
1. Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl (official results portal, continuously updated, factual, 2022 data show ‘Lokale partijen’ 31.3 %). – High quality, no opinions.  
2. Geopolitique.eu article on 2022 municipal elections (Mar-2022, academic). Confirms local parties largest bloc (≈36 %). – Good secondary factual source.  
3. IamExpat.nl recap of 2022 election (Mar-2022, journalistic). Gives same numbers; corroborates #2. – Moderate quality.  
4. Maurice de Hond blog (14 Feb 2026, veteran pollster). States local/other parties expected to gain further; no numbers. – Single expert opinion.  
5. AskNews/NL Times 18 Feb 2026 pieces on new local parties & asylum debate. Factual count: 141 new local parties in 104 municipalities. – High quality data point.  
6. Local-poll stories (Rotterdam, Amsterdam, The Hague – Feb 2026). Consistently show at least three different parties <20 % each, none approaching nationwide 15 % on their own; reinforce fragmentation. – Moderate.  
7. PolitPro / POLITICO national-election polls (general-election context, dated 2026 & 2022). Show leading national parties in the mid-teens at best, illustrating continued fragmentation nationally. – Weak relevance to municipal vote shares.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence  
• Historical results 2002-2022: in all six cycles, the nationwide #1 list (‘Lokale partijen’) scored 23-36 %.  
• Structural factor: the Dutch electoral council aggregates hundreds of purely local lists under the umbrella “Lokale partijen”; this methodological choice is baked into the published national table and is very unlikely to change for 2026.

Moderate evidence  
• 141 brand-new local parties registered for 2026 (NL Times 18 Feb 2026) → indicates momentum, not retrenchment.  
• Pollster Maurice de Hond expects further rise of ‘other’ parties.  
• City polls (Amsterdam, Rotterdam) display extreme vote dispersion; no single national list close to 15 %.

Weak evidence  
• National (Tweede Kamer) polling trends; different election, turnout pattern.  
• Ballot-paper experiment stories – tangential to vote share distribution.

(c) Timeframe analysis
• 28 days to election; ≈70 days to resolution deadline.  
• Halving (14 days): little opportunity for definition changes; probability virtually unchanged.  
• Doubling (56 days): still before official publication but after election; tail risk (legal dispute, data anomaly) rises slightly but still tiny (<1 pp).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base rate = 94 % (6/6 historical successes minus 6 pp tail-risk discount).  
Current information provides only reinforcing signals: more local lists running, no sign of collapsing support, expert commentary pointing upward. The only credible path to a “No” outcome would be a last-minute methodological change that stops grouping local lists together. The Interior Ministry and Electoral Council have announced no such reform; all communications about the 2026 vote still use the familiar “Lokale partijen” label.

Given the incremental positive evidence, I add +2 pp to the outside view and keep a 4 pp cushion for black-swans (e.g., data processing error, unexpected legal reclassification).

Inside-view probability = 96 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that 96 out of 100 times, the party with the largest nationwide vote share in Dutch municipal elections 2026 will take ≥15 % of the vote.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “By 1 May 2026 the top nationwide list in the 18 Mar 2026 Dutch municipal elections must have ≥15 % share for ‘Yes’.”  
2. Base rate declared (94 %).  
3. Consistency check done (“96/100 times…”).  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
   • All six prior elections: top-list 23-36 %.  
   • 141 new local parties registered, shows growth.  
   • City polls demonstrate continuing fragmentation.  
   • No announced change to Electoral-Council grouping methodology.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden rule change splitting ‘Lokale partijen’ into municipality-specific buckets would crash share; would push probability below 50 %.  
6. Status-quo gently favours “Yes”; timeframe short; minor mean-reversion bias applied via 4 pp tail-risk deduction.

Probability: 96%
