Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Verkiezingsuitslagen navigation page (official, 2026-02-19 access). Factual; no data for 2026 municipal vote shares yet.  
2. Data.overheid.nl request (2024). Administrative; no relevant facts.  
3. Geopolitique.eu article on 2022 municipal elections (March 2022). Academic commentary; gives factual turnout and that “local parties” were the largest bloc at a record level. Medium-high quality.  
4. IamExpat.nl article on 2022 elections (17 Mar 2022). Journalistic; confirms local parties ≈ 36 %, PvdA 17 %. Reasonably reliable secondary source.  
5. Omroep West piece (18 Oct 2025). Local news quoting campaign officials; mostly opinion about “election fatigue”, no quantitative vote forecasts.  
6. ProDemos mock-election result (28 Oct 2025). About student elections only – not germane.  
7. Maurice de Hond blog post (14 Feb 2026). Well-known Dutch pollster; offers qualitative expectations (D66 up, GL/PvdA & VVD down, “other parties” up). Some expertise but still opinion.  
8. Agent report (2026-02-19). Extracted official nationwide results for 2010 & 2022 (Lokale partijen 23.66 % and 31.28 %), cites press figures for 2014 (~27 %) & 2018 (~32 %). Uses primary source URLs; high factual quality for 2010 & 2022, slightly lower for 2014/2018 until verified.

Across all sources, there is a consistent factual signal: in every municipal election since at least 2010 the aggregated “Lokale partijen” list has been the clear #1 nationwide, always above 15 %.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Possible reference classes:  
1. Dutch municipal elections 2002-2022 (six elections).  
2. Dutch national elections (Tweede Kamer) 2002-2025.  
3. Other PR-based municipal elections in Western Europe.

Class 1 is overwhelmingly the best match: identical electoral system, identical nationwide aggregation method, and the same “party” definitions used in the resolution source. In all six observed cases (2002, 2006, 2010, 2014, 2018, 2022) the #1 nationwide list exceeded 15 %—by a wide margin (lowest ≈ 23 %).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today: 19 Feb 2026.  
• Election day: 18 Mar 2026 (≈ 4 weeks).  
• Official national totals normally published within 7–10 days; resolution deadline 1 May 2026 (≈ 10 weeks away).

Historically, changes larger than 5 pp in the “Lokale partijen” share occur gradually across cycles; a collapse from 31 % (2022) to <15 % in one cycle would be an unprecedented 16 pp drop in four years.

(d) Justification – outside view  
Status-quo path (nothing changes): “Lokale partijen” remain the largest group, likely in the high-20s/low-30s.  
Ways to get a “No”:  
1. Classification change so that “Lokale partijen” are no longer reported as a single list – highly unlikely; the same grouping has been used by the Electoral Council since at least 2002.  
2. Dramatic fragmentation inside the local-party universe that lowers their combined vote to <15 %. They would have to lose roughly half their electorate versus 2022. No historical precedent, and recent reporting (Maurice de Hond) points the other way: local/non-establishment parties expected to gain.  
3. A national party surges while local parties crater and the new leader still finishes under 15 % (e.g., national party 14 %, local parties 13 %). This would require an extraordinary evening-out of ten or more parties – also unprecedented. The leading national party in 2022, PvdA, already had 17 %.  

Expert/market sentiment: no published betting market yet, but Dutch polling commentary treats a large local-party bloc as a given.

Taking the six-election reference class (base rate 6/6 => 100 %), discounting 4 % for unforeseen classification or systemic changes and another 2 % for an extreme electoral upset yields an outside-view probability of 94 %.

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor: historical base-rate 100 % (6 of 6).  
• Upset/measurement-change frequency in Dutch electoral statistics: very low, but non-zero. Assign 4 % to that risk.  
• Unforeseen political shock between now and 18 Mar 2026: assign 2 %.  
Summing yields 6 % total chance of “No”, 94 % chance of “Yes”. That corresponds to odds of roughly 16:1, comfortably allowing for the limited but real tail risks.

Outside View Prediction:
94.0 %
