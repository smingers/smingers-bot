# Summary of Article: Municipal Elections in the Netherlands, 13 March 2022

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Election Context:**
- Municipal elections held on March 16, 2022 in 333 out of 344 municipalities
- Elections held every four years in March on a Wednesday
- Due to COVID-19, voting was possible two days prior to official election date

**Three Striking Results:**
1. Record low turnout
2. Record high vote share won by local parties
3. All-time high fragmentation of municipal councils

**Turnout:**
- Only 51.0% of electorate voted - an all-time low
- This represented a 4-percentage point drop from 2018 municipal elections
- Previous elections (2002-2018) had turnout fluctuating around 55%
- Turnout varied by municipality size:
  - Smallest municipalities: 58.2% average
  - Largest municipalities: 46.1% average

**Local Parties Performance:**
- Local parties (parties competing in only one municipality, unrelated to national parties) became the most prominent
- Historical context: Local parties obtained ~11.7% of votes in 1986 municipal elections
- Their vote share gradually increased during the 1990s
- In 2002, local parties became the plurality party for the first time, obtaining 25% of votes
- The article indicates they grew even further in 2022 compared to 2018 (though the exact 2022 figure appears cut off in the provided text)

**Campaign Characteristics:**
- Campaigns were relatively local
- National media attention was limited due to the war in Ukraine dominating news
- National politicians had limited visibility during the campaign
- Local issues included development plans and housing crisis/affordable housing accessibility

**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off at the end, so the complete 2022 local party vote share figure and additional results may not be fully captured in this summary.

# Summary of Article from Omroepwest.nl (October 18, 2025)

## Key Context
The article discusses how local political parties in The Hague are responding to unexpected snap national parliamentary elections (Tweede Kamerverkiezingen) scheduled for October 29, which have disrupted preparations for the upcoming municipal elections on March 18, 2026.

## Main Points

### Impact on Local Campaign Preparations
- Local parties were already preparing for municipal election campaigns when the national government fell, triggering snap elections
- **Debbie van de Wijngaard (VVD campaign leader, The Hague)**: Campaigning requires time, people, and financial resources. The volunteer pool remains roughly the same, forcing parties to make choices to avoid exhausting volunteers before municipal elections begin
- **Lotte van Basten Batenburg (VVD list leader)**: National elections cause local themes to receive less attention, which is unfortunate since local issues are what municipal politicians actually govern

### Challenges for Local Parties
- **Michel Vermeer (Haagse Stadspartij campaign leader)**: 
  - It's very difficult for local parties to break through the political noise surrounding national elections
  - National parties receive substantial funding from their parent organizations (VVD, GroenLinks, Partij voor de Dieren), while local parties must operate without such support, limiting their ability to buy advertisements or print flyers
  - Risk of "election fatigue" - people may lose interest in going to the polls due to the high number of elections

### Election Fatigue Concerns
- **Richard de Mos (Hart voor Den Haag)**: If people become election-weary, it poses a serious threat to municipal elections turnout
- However, De Mos notes his party runs continuous campaigns and is active in neighborhoods 24/7, so their plans haven't been disrupted

### Potential Opportunities
- **De Mos**: Local parties can differentiate themselves from national political squabbling and position themselves as parties that actually address local issues. "People are fed up with national politics. They're tired of the arguing. Our strength as a local party is that we can show we want to make the city better in a positive way and with good intentions. Trust in local parties is growing."
- **Vermeer**: Agrees that contrasting with national "troublemakers" is beneficial, emphasizing that local parties draw their issues directly from the city

### Impact on National Party Branches
- **Van Basten Batenburg (VVD)**: The national VVD appears headed for significant losses, which affects the local branch since they share the same brand name. However, she says this also makes them more determined to convince people they have the best plans for both the country and The Hague.

## Note on Source Reliability
All opinions cited are from named local political figures in The Hague representing various parties (VVD, Haagse Stadspartij, Hart voor Den Haag).

<Summary source="https://prodemos.nl/nieuws/scholierenverkiezingen-uitslag-2025/">
## Summary of Article

**Source:** ProDemos  
**Date:** October 28, 2025

### Key Facts and Statistics:

This article discusses the 2025 Scholierenverkiezingen (Student Elections), which are mock elections for young people, NOT the actual municipal elections referenced in the forecasting question. The article is about national parliamentary (Tweede Kamer) elections practice, not municipal elections.

**Participation:**
- 165,798 secondary school students and MBO students cast votes in the mock elections
- 435 schools registered approximately 300,000 students to participate
- This represents the highest number of votes cast since ProDemos began organizing these mock elections in 1994

**Mock Election Results (for practice parliamentary elections):**
- PVV received 19.97% of votes (would translate to 32 seats)
- D66 received 19.50% of votes (would translate to 31 seats)
- GroenLinks-PvdA received 10.29% of votes (would translate to 16 seats)
- Forum voor Democratie dropped from 13.32% in 2023 to 3.23% in 2025
- NL PLAN received 5.51% of votes
- 18 political parties total would enter parliament based on these results

**Historical Context:**
- In 2023 mock elections, PVV was also the largest party with 15.83% of votes

### Important Caveats:

The article explicitly states: "The results of the Scholierenverkiezingen are not a predictor of the actual results of the Tweede Kamerverkiezing [parliamentary election] on Wednesday, October 29."

**Note:** This article is about mock student elections for national parliamentary elections, not about actual municipal elections. It provides no direct information about the 2026 Dutch municipal elections that are the subject of the forecasting question.

# Summary of Article: "Gemeenteraadsverkiezings patronen"

**Source:** Maurice de Hond  
**Date:** February 14, 2026  
**Author:** Maurice

## Key Facts and Statistics:

### Municipal Size Distribution (by voter turnout in 2022):
- Municipalities < 25,000 inhabitants: 15% of voters
- 25,000-50,000 inhabitants: 30% of voters
- 50,000-100,000 inhabitants: 19% of voters
- 100,000-200,000 inhabitants: 18% of voters
- > 200,000 inhabitants: 17% of voters
- **Total: 45% of voters live in municipalities under 50,000 inhabitants**

### Historical Performance by Municipality Size:

**Local Parties:**
- Small municipalities (< 25,000): 37% in 2018, 41% in 2022
- Large municipalities (> 200,000): around 20%

**"Other National Parties" (including PVV, FVD, JA21, BBB):**
- These parties received nearly 30% combined in TK 2025 nationally
- Small municipalities: approximately 15% for "other national parties" in municipal elections
- Large municipalities: 15% for "other national parties" in municipal elections

### Left-Right Divide by Municipality Size (TK 2025):
- Large municipalities (> 200,000): Left parties through D66 scored 61%; VVD and rightward scored 30%
- Small municipalities (< 25,000): Left parties through D66 scored only 27%; VVD and rightward scored 51%

### Turnout:
- Municipal elections: between 50-55%
- National elections (Tweede Kamer): around 80%

## Predictions for March 18, 2026 Elections:

**From Maurice de Hond (opinion from named source):**
- **D66:** Expected to rise significantly compared to previous municipal elections - increase of 50-100% in most municipalities
- **GroenLinks/PvdA and VVD:** Both parties expected to lose in most municipalities
- **CDA:** Expected to finish close to their results from four years ago in most municipalities
- **Other parties:** Total vote share expected to increase in most municipalities, but depends on which parties participate and local party popularity
- **Turnout:** Expected to be between 50% and 55% nationally

## Additional Context:
- The article notes that local parties particularly attract voters who normally don't vote for GroenLinks/PvdA, D66, CDA, or VVD
- GroenLinks/PvdA and D66 are much stronger in large municipalities than small ones
- CDA performs better in small municipalities (opposite pattern from D66/GL-PvdA)
- DENK and PvdD score much higher in large municipalities than small ones
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide nationwide results tables for Dutch municipal elections 2010-2022 from Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl, listing the #1 party and its vote share each year; indicate if any exceeded 15 %.
Nationwide (landelijk) vote totals on Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl show that in every Dutch municipal election since 2010 the bloc “Lokale partijen” – i.e. all lists that do not take part in national parliamentary elections – received by far the most votes.  
Below are the nationwide #1 parties and their official vote shares for the elections that have been located so far:

• 3 March 2010 – Lokale partijen 23.66 % of all valid votes (Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl, GR 20100303).

• 16 March 2022 – Lokale partijen 31.28 % of all valid votes (Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl, GR 20220316).

For both elections the nationwide #1 party cleared the 15 % threshold stipulated in the forecasting question.

Information still missing
The nationwide result tables for the two intervening elections are required to complete the 2010-2022 series, but have not yet been retrieved from Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl:

• 19 March 2014 – URL likely https://www.verkiezingsuitslagen.nl/verkiezingen/detail/GR20140319  
• 21 March 2018 – URL likely https://www.verkiezingsuitslagen.nl/verkiezingen/detail/GR20180321

Press coverage and secondary compilations (e.g. NOS, 22 Mar 2018) state that “lokale partijen” scored 27.6 % in 2014 and 32-33 % in 2018, making them unmistakably the largest grouping and again well above 15 %.  However, the resolution criteria for the forecasting question call for the figures exactly as shown in the nationwide table on Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl, so those two official percentages must still be verified and extracted.

Once the 2014 and 2018 nationwide tables are added, the final answer table will be:

Year – #1 party – official nationwide vote share – ≥ 15 %?  
2010 – Lokale partijen – 23.66 % – Yes  
2014 – (expected: Lokale partijen – c. 27 %) – Yes  
2018 – (expected: Lokale partijen – c. 32 %) – Yes  
2022 – Lokale partijen – 31.28 % – Yes

All evidence so far therefore points to the top party always exceeding 15 % during 2010-2022, but official Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl percentages for 2014 and 2018 are still needed to fully satisfy the query.</Agent_report>
