Analysis:
The key to estimating whether the top party will clear the 15 % threshold is fresh polling or analytical coverage that aggregates local-level intentions into a nationwide tally. Useful items include: (1) any recent Ipsos/I&O/Kantar polls that model expected nationwide shares for municipal elections; (2) press or think-tank pieces discussing how party fragmentation, local lists, or emerging forces such as BBB, PVV or a GroenLinks-PvdA joint list might affect the national totals; (3) historical context comparing 2022 results where the largest party barely exceeded 20 %, showing the baseline. Therefore we need news articles or datasets published in the last few weeks, expert commentary, and possibly municipal-specific polling that analysts convert into national shares.
