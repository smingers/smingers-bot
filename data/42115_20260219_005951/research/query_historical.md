Analysis:
The key to an outside-view baseline is knowing how large the top party’s nationwide vote share has been in past Dutch municipal elections. Dutch local elections are highly fragmented because thousands of purely local parties compete alongside the national parties. Historically, the nationwide #1 party has usually been a national party such as VVD, CDA, or PvdA, but its share has tended to hover well below 15 %. Verifying exact numbers for 2022, 2018, 2014, etc. on Verkiezingsuitslagen.nl (or credible secondary summaries) will show whether any year in recent decades broke the 15 % threshold. That historical distribution is the single most relevant piece of context for forecasting 2026.
