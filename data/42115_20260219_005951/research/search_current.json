The new ballot design, tested during the 2024 European elections and again in the 2024 Second Chamber elections, was used by five municipalities: Alphen aan den Rijn, Boekel, Borne, Midden-Delfland, and Tynaarlo. These municipalities reported that 81% of election counters found the new ballot easier to handle, primarily because the candidate they voted for was immediately visible at a glance. However, the rate of invalid votes was higher in these municipalities (0.48%) compared to the national average (0.26%), with the most common error being the coloring of only the candidate\u2019s number without selecting a party. The demissionary minister noted a clear learning effect, as the invalid vote rate had been 0.74% during the 2024 European elections. He also pointed out that voter turnout was significantly higher (78.3%) in the Second Chamber elections than in the European elections (46.2%), meaning many voters were first-time users of the new ballot. Henk van der Kolk, professor of electoral politics, emphasized that while minimizing invalid votes is important, the practicality of the counting process must also be considered, especially given the aging population of election counters. The new ballot also led to a higher rate of preferential votes (36.6% vs. 30.9% nationally), likely because voters must explicitly select a candidate number in a separate step. However, Borne decided not to participate in the upcoming municipal elections, citing concerns over reduced candidate recognition and a 'difficult trade-off' between usability and political preference. Other municipalities joining the trial include Gouda, Leiden, Meierijstad, Nijmegen, Noordoostpolder, 's-Hertogenbosch, and Soest. The final decision on nationwide adoption will be made by the Minister of the Interior after the upcoming municipal elections.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 07:49 PM\nSource:[NRC](https://www.nrc.nl/nieuws/2026/02/18/met-het-nieuwe-stembiljet-gaat-het-tellen-twee-keer-zo-snel-maar-je-stemt-wel-op-een-nummertje-a4920851)\n\n**Amsterdam City Council Election Polls Spark Campaign Momentum**\nAccording to a representative poll conducted by O&S for AT5 and Het Parool, involving 1,354 Amsterdam residents (1,176 via the O&S residents' panel and 178 in face-to-face interviews), the VVD's support has dropped from 10.5% to 7.4%, prompting Fractievoorzitter Daan Wijnants to dismiss the poll as insignificant, stating, 'The campaign has now begun. Now we will make something of it, and in the coming weeks you will see that the VVD story will land strongly with Amsterdammers.' Wijnants emphasized that Amsterdam residents are tired of eight years of tax increases and want more value for their money, advocating for a cleaner, safer city with more affordable housing. The PvdA leads the poll, closely followed by GroenLinks, though the two parties are expected to merge after the municipal elections. Fractieleider Sofyan Mbarki expressed optimism, saying, 'That\u2019s a nice outlook. We\u2019re not there yet\u2014these are polls\u2014but the energy we have, we\u2019ll give even more in the coming period.' Carla Kabama of Partij voor Morgen, whose party narrowly misses a seat, questioned the depth of the pollsters\u2019 engagement, asking, 'Did they really go deep into Zuidoost, Nieuw-West, Noord, and Oost\u2014where the people who voted for me in 2022 live? Did they speak with those who said Partij voor Morgen was their choice?' She remains hopeful, noting Amsterdam has nearly one million residents. D66 would gain a seat if elections were held now, and Fractievoorzitter Rob Hofland expressed enthusiasm: 'I\u2019m very happy. The last time I stood in front of your camera, we had four seats in Amsterdam; now we have eight, so you see we\u2019re growing significantly.' However, D66 appears to be losing support compared to the previous Tweede Kamerverkiezingen, when it attracted many former PvdA and GroenLinks voters, who now seem to have returned to those parties.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 05:30 PM\nSource:[AT5](https://www.at5.nl/artikelen/236955/raadsleden-reageren-op-peilingen-de-campagne-is-begonnen)\n\n**A Left-Wing Majority in Frankfurt\u2019s City Council Possible After March 2026 Municipal Election**\nA Forsa poll commissioned by the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung (FAZ) indicates that a left-leaning majority in Frankfurt's city council (R\u00f6mer) is possible after the March 15, 2026 municipal election. The SPD is projected to receive 20% of the vote (up from 17% in 2021), the Greens 19% (down from 24.6%), and the Left Party (Die Linke) 12% (up from 7.9%), totaling 51% when combined. With additional support from Volt, which is projected to gain 3% (down from 3.7%), the progressive bloc would reach 54% of the vote share. The CDU is forecast as the strongest party with 24% (up from 21.9%), but would not form a majority on its own. The FDP is expected to drop to 3% (down from 7.6%), while 'B\u00fcrger f\u00fcr Frankfurt' remain at 2%, the AfD at 11% (down from 4.5% in 2021), BSW at 2%, and 'Others' at 4% (down from 10.8%). The poll surveyed 1,014 residents between February 2 and 10, 2026, with a margin of error of \u00b13 percentage points. Only 57% of respondents knew the election date, with younger adults (18\u201334) less informed than those over 60. Voter turnout could surpass the 45.1% recorded in 2021, as 60% of respondents said they plan to vote. Local issues\u2014such as housing costs, mobility, school infrastructure, and cleanliness\u2014were cited as the most influential factors in voting decisions by 75% of respondents, compared to 14% citing federal politics and 5% citing state politics. The SPD welcomed the findings, noting that respondents credited them with the highest competence in solving local problems, and emphasized their responsibility for key city issues like housing, transportation, social security, and economic strength. Forsa plans to conduct further polls in the lead-up to the election.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 01:15 PM\nSource:[Frankfurter Rundschau](https://www.fr.de/frankfurt/eine-linke-mehrheit-im-roemer-ist-nach-der-wahl-moeglich-94175990.html)\n\n**Dead Heat in Amsterdam Poll: PvdA, GroenLinks, and D66 Battle for Top Spot in Municipal Elections**\nA new poll by research agency Onderzoek en Statistiek (O&S), commissioned by Het Parool and AT5, reveals a tight race among three progressive parties in Amsterdam ahead of the 2026 municipal elections. The PvdA leads with 17.8% of the vote (9 seats), followed closely by GroenLinks at 16.2% (8 seats) and D66 at 15.4% (8 seats), with margins so narrow that any of the three could emerge as the top party. The PvdA and GroenLinks are expected to form a joint council group, making them the largest bloc. D66\u2019s performance is a drop from its 23.9% national showing in November 2023, indicating that national success does not guarantee local strength. The CDA is slightly rising but not at a pace matching national trends. The VVD continues its downward trajectory, according to Cohen. Bij1, which won three seats in 2022, has collapsed to 3.5% and would retain only one seat after splitting. Newer parties such as BBB, 50Plus, De Vonk, ChristenUnie, and Partij voor Morgen are unlikely to cross the electoral threshold. Researchers stress that the poll is a snapshot: turnout, which fell below 50% in 2022, could significantly shift results, especially for fringe parties like FvD, Denk, or Bij1. The poll was conducted between January 27 and February 9, 2026, among 1,354 Amsterdammers, and the national coalition agreement was announced on January 30. A second poll will be published on March 16, two days before the March 18 election.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 01:01 PM\nSource:[Het Parool](https://www.parool.nl/international/dead-heat-in-new-amsterdam-poll-pvda-groenlinks-and-d66-battle-for-top-spot-in-elections~b7121f31/)\n\n**PvdA, GroenLinks, and D66 Neck-and-Neck in Poll Ahead of Amsterdam Municipal Elections**\nA month before the municipal elections in Amsterdam, a poll by O&S\u2014conducted for AT5 and Het Parool\u2014shows the PvdA leading with 17.8% of the vote, followed closely by GroenLinks with 16.2% and D66 with 15.4%. The PvdA and GroenLinks would retain their current 9 and 8 seats respectively, while D66 would gain one seat, bringing its total to 8. D66's performance in this poll is notably weaker than its 23.8% result in the October 2023 general election, suggesting a drop in momentum. The VVD is projected to lose a seat, falling to 7.4% from 10.5% in 2022. BIJ1 is expected to lose significantly but retain one seat, while its offshoots De Vonk and De Partij voor Morgen are unlikely to gain representation. The Partij voor de Dieren and JA21 are projected to gain seats, and Forum voor Democratie remains at one seat. Notably, local parties such as Hart voor Amsterdam and Namens Amsterdammers are not expected to win any seats, as in the previous election cycle. A record 35 parties are contesting the elections, but local parties still face significant barriers. Voter turnout will likely be decisive, especially benefiting fringe parties like Denk, which remains at two seats. Nearly half (49%) of respondents believe Amsterdam is going in the wrong direction, with 65% holding the same view about the Netherlands. Most voters (50%) base their choice primarily on local issues, though national politics also influence decisions. The top concerns among Amsterdam residents are the housing market (52%), societal hardening (31%), crime and safety (25%), and tourism and congestion (24%).\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 01:00 PM\nSource:[AT5](https://www.at5.nl/artikelen/236945/pvda-groenlinks-en-d66-nek-aan-nek-in-peiling-maand-voor-gemeenteraadsverkiezingen)\n\n**Voting Guides for Municipal Elections Go Online, but Not All Municipalities Participate**\nIn preparation for the municipal council elections on March 18, 2026, the Stemwijzer (Voting Guide) has gone online for most municipalities in the Netherlands.

Of these, 24\u2014approximately one in six or 17%\u2014are explicitly opposed to opening asylum shelters in their towns, aiming to challenge the Asylum Distribution Law, which mandates municipalities to host a fair share of asylum seekers. The law requires opening shelters in areas that previously had none, leading to fierce protests and increased threats against local politicians in past years. While over 80% of new parties do not specify their stance on asylum shelters, some explicitly support the law, while others impose strict conditions such as small-scale shelters, enhanced security, and placement outside residential areas. The implementation of the law remains significantly behind schedule: as of January 2026, only about 80,000 shelter beds were available, with only 40% of municipalities meeting their targets and nearly 200 lacking sufficient space\u2014over 100 have no asylum shelters at all.

The guide is accessible through these media platforms, allowing voters to engage with information at the moment and location where they typically seek local news. Most municipalities use a single voter guide, with the Kieskompas serving as an alternative in 49 other municipalities. Of the 342 municipalities in the Netherlands, 340 are participating in the elections; Wijdemeren will merge into Hilversum next year, with its residents voting in November 2026 for the new council of the merged municipality.

ProDemos, a civic education organization, attributes the low urgency around local elections to public misunderstanding of the municipality\u2019s responsibilities. According to spokesperson Mitchell Wiegand Bruss, many citizens do not realize that local governments directly impact daily life\u2014such as parking regulations, caf\u00e9 opening hours, and housing development. While national politics receives more media visibility, ProDemos emphasizes that municipal councils are closer to citizens and make decisions affecting neighborhoods directly. Despite this, 47% of respondents report little or no interest in local politics. The survey also finds that 33% of potential voters still do not know which party they will support. ProDemos urges voters to increase engagement by using tools like the voting guide and learning about parties\u2019 positions, stating that this requires minimal time but significantly improves preparedness. The organization stresses that greater civic awareness and meaningful citizen input could raise voter urgency.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: January 18, 2026 01:19 PM\nSource:[Hart van Nederland](https://www.hartvannederland.nl/politiek/verkiezingen/artikelen/daarom-is-jouw-stem-bij-gemeenteraadsverkiezingen-belangrijk)\n\n**More Errors on New Smaller Ballot Than on 'Old' One, but Trial Continues Ahead of March 2026 Municipal Elections**\nIn the Netherlands, municipal elections are scheduled for Wednesday, March 18, 2026, with nearly 14 million eligible voters participating. The Ministry of the Interior and Kingdom Relations has evaluated the trial of the new smaller ballot paper, which was previously tested in five municipalities during the 2023 parliamentary elections. The trial showed a decrease in invalid votes from 0.74% in the first test to 0.47% (approximately 50,000 votes) in the most recent trial. However, the House of Representatives considers this rate still too high, especially since the new system counts certain technically invalid votes as valid\u2014such as when a voter marks the party circle but omits the candidate number circle. In such cases, the vote is attributed to the party\u2019s lead candidate, a rule established in the Temporary Experiment Decision on New Ballot Papers. This contrasts with the previous ballot system, which had a lower invalid vote rate of 0.26%. Kamerlid Vermeer criticizes the system for deviating from the Dutch electoral law, which emphasizes individual candidates over party lists. Kamerlid Van Baarle questions whether the new ballot was scientifically tested for comprehensibility across all education and skill levels and argues that democratic integrity should justify higher costs. The minister acknowledges that voter demographics behind errors cannot be determined due to ballot secrecy, but notes that people with disabilities report higher satisfaction with the new ballot and that production costs for voting aids for blind and low-vision voters have significantly decreased. Despite these benefits, including reduced workload for election bureaus, a final decision on full implementation will be made only after the March 2026 municipal elections, based on the outcomes of the ongoing trials.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 05:51 PM\nSource:[NOS](https://nos.nl/artikel/2598189-meer-fouten-bij-klein-stembiljet-dan-bij-het-oude-in-maart-nieuwe-poging)\n\n**Eleven municipalities to test smaller ballot in municipal elections next year**\nEleven municipalities in the Netherlands\u2014Den Bosch, Leiden, Meijerijstad, Nijmegen, Noordoostpolder, Soest, Gouda, Alphen aan den Rijn, Boekel, Midden-Delfland, and Tynaarlo\u2014will use a smaller ballot paper in the municipal elections scheduled for March 2026. Five municipalities tested the smaller ballot in the 2024 parliamentary elections, and the Electoral Council reported positive results. Borne withdrew from the experiment due to concerns over a higher invalid vote rate (0.46%) and the lack of visible candidate names on the ballot, which instead used numbered references linked to a booklet in the voting booth. However, the overall invalid vote rate across the pilot municipalities decreased from 0.74% in the 2023 European elections to 0.47% in 2024, despite individual rates like 0.63% in Boekel and 0.5% in Alphen aan den Rijn. A Ministry of Home Affairs spokesperson noted that adaptation to changes takes time, and the pilot helps identify limitations. Both the Electoral Council and the Ministry remain supportive, stating that smaller ballots improve the voting and counting process. The Electoral Council expressed disappointment over Borne\u2019s withdrawal, emphasizing that reverting to the old ballot could confuse voters in that municipality.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 12, 2025 07:46 AM\nSource:[NL Times](https://nltimes.nl/2025/12/12/eleven-municipalities-test-smaller-ballot-municipal-elections-next-year)\n\n**Despite PVV Victory in Venray, D66 Remains Largest Party After National Vote Count**\nIn Venray, the last municipality in the Netherlands to announce its election results, the PVV (Party for Freedom) became the largest party for the second consecutive year, securing 20.1% of the vote\u2014up 7.8 percentage points from the previous election. However, despite this local victory, D66 remains the largest party nationally after the final tally of votes from all Dutch municipalities was completed. D66 increased its share of the vote from 5.6% in 2023 to 15.7% in 2025, making it the biggest party in the country overall.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 07:10 PM\nSource:[Zeelandnet](https://www.zeelandnet.nl/nieuws/ondanks-winst-pvv-venray-is-d66-grootste-na-tellen-alle-gemeenten)\n\n**Vlissingen Voters Back PVV in Second Chamber Elections**\nIn the municipal elections for the Dutch Second Chamber, voters in Vlissingen cast the highest percentage of votes for the Party for Freedom (PVV), with 19.8% of the local vote. D66 followed with 14.8% of the vote. Nationally, as final votes were being counted, the PVV and D66 remained closely matched, each projected to secure 26 seats in the parliamentary peiings.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 06:58 AM\nSource:[Zeelandnet](https://www.zeelandnet.nl/nieuws/tweede-kamerverkiezingen-vlissingen-stemt-pvv)\n\n**Preliminary Voter Turnout for Dutch Second Chamber Elections Slightly Below 2023 Levels**\nThe preliminary voter turnout for the Dutch Second Chamber elections was 65% at 19:45, slightly lower than the 66% recorded at the same time two years prior. According to Ipsos I&O, the overall turnout for the day has been consistently lower than in the 2023 elections, which ultimately reached 77.7%. In the Caribbean part of the Kingdom, voting took place with 853 eligible voters in Aruba, 1,722 in Cura\u00e7ao, and 234 in Sint-Maarten. Brief voters received a cupcake as a token of appreciation. On Schiermonnikoog, turnout reached 126% due to tourists voting, which is possible when non-residents participate. Five municipalities tested a new, smaller ballot paper where voters first color the party box red, then the candidate box\u2014failure to do so results in a vote for the party's lead candidate. Some voters were initially confused, but staff assistance resolved the issue. The new method is being evaluated for easier handling and faster counting, and a law change is needed for nationwide implementation. The counting process begins at 21:00, with two-thirds of municipalities using a faster method that counts party votes first, allowing earlier results. First results are expected around 21:30 from small municipalities like Vlieland and Schiermonnikoog, with larger areas following by 22:30. Most municipalities expect to release results between 23:30 and 02:00. The first exit poll will be broadcast at 21:00 on NOS platforms and is considered a reliable indicator of seat distribution. Voting occurred in diverse locations including football stadiums, zoos, fire stations, and even the Westerbork Memorial Centre.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: October 29, 2025 06:58 PM\nSource:[NOS](https://nos.nl/collectie/14006/liveblog/2588440-tussentijds-opkomstcijfer-19-45-uur-net-iets-lager-cupcake-voor-briefstemmers-aruba-en-curacao)\n\n**Voting in the Netherlands: Guidelines and FAQs Ahead of the 2025 House of Representatives Election**\nOn Wednesday, October 29, 2025, Dutch citizens will vote in the general election for the House of Representatives, with eligibility requiring Dutch nationality and being 18 years or older. Although there is no voting obligation, all eligible voters receive a voting card (stempas) automatically. According to Noumidia Massaoudi from ProDemos, voters must not forget their identification document, even if it is up to five years expired. Over 10,000 polling stations are open across the Netherlands, operating from 07:30 to 21:00. Voters may cast their ballot at any polling station within their municipality, but those outside their home municipality can request a voter pass (kiezerspas) for nationwide voting\u2014applications had to be submitted in writing by Friday, October 24, or orally by Tuesday, October 28, at 12:00. If a voter loses their voting card, they must request a replacement under the same rules; without it, they cannot vote. A proxy vote is allowed only with prior consent and must be cast simultaneously with the proxy\u2019s own vote. For voters with physical or visual impairments, a trusted person may accompany them into the voting booth, but cannot make the choice for them. Voters with intellectual disabilities may receive guidance from a supervisor or polling station official but must cast their vote independently. Regarding selfies in the voting booth\u2014known as a '#stemfie'\u2014Massaoudi confirms it is permitted, and even politicians do it. The Kiesraad confirms this, but warns that the voting process must remain calm and orderly, and other voters must not be included in the photo without consent. The red pencil used in the booth is mandatory for visibility during vote counting; ballots marked with blue or black ink are invalid. The red pencil tradition dates back to 1922 and is codified in the Dutch Electoral Act. Voters may bring their own red pencil as a personal tradition. Voters may also choose to vote blank, which counts toward voter turnout but not seat allocation, or cast a preference vote for a specific candidate, which can help a candidate enter parliament even from a lower position on the party list.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 03:09 PM\nSource:[Telegraaf](https://www.telegraaf.nl/binnenland/selfie-maken-in-het-stemhokje-dat-mag-maar-stemproces-moet-wel-rustig-en-ordelijk-verlopen/99575725.html)\n\n**Over 30% of Voters in Oldenzaal Are 65 or Older, Reflecting National Trend of Aging Electorate**\nIn Oldenzaal, 31.4% of the 25,500 eligible voters for the October 29, 2025, Dutch House of Representatives election are 65 years or older, totaling 8,100 voters. This exceeds the national average of 28% for voters aged 65 or older, a significant increase from 18% in 1995. The share of voters aged 18 to 35 is 25%, slightly lower than in similar municipalities and down since 1995. In Oldenzaal, the proportion of voters aged 65-plus is higher than that of voters under 35. Additionally, 7% of voters are over 80, a group known for high electoral loyalty, often consistently supporting the same party\u2014benefiting parties like the CDA. Voting is available at 17 locations within the municipality, but no candidate for the House of Representatives resides in Oldenzaal, so no local candidate can be voted for. Nationally, the highest proportion of voters aged 65+ is in Bergen (North Holland), while the highest proportion of 18-35-year-olds is in university cities such as Groningen and Utrecht.\nOriginal language: nl\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 04:30 AM\nSource:[AD](https://www.ad.nl/oldenzaal/ruim-drie-op-de-tien-kiezers-in-oldenzaal-is-65-jaar-of-ouder~a2386c26/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
