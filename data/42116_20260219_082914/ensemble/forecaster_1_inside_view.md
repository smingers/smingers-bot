## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Multiple independent polls converge on CDU 29%, Greens 23%**: SWR/Infratest dimap (Jan 22), Handelsblatt median (Feb 18), confirmed by Spiegel (Jan 28). This is the strongest evidence - multiple reliable sources with clear methodology showing consistent 6-point CDU lead.

2. **Sustained trend since spring 2024**: SWR reports CDU has led for over 2 years, with lead gradually narrowing from 16 points (Oct 2024) to 6 points (Jan 2026). The stability suggests structural shift rather than temporary bounce.

3. **Seat projections favor CDU**: Agent report shows CDU projected at 38 seats vs Greens 27-30 seats across different polls, providing 8-11 seat buffer.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Direct preference polling**: Özdemir leads Hagel 39% to 19%, but this doesn't directly translate to party votes. In parliamentary systems, party strength matters more than individual popularity for determining largest party.

2. **New electoral system uncertainty**: First election under two-vote system. Wagschal warns about potential split voting effects. This adds uncertainty but proportional systems generally track polling well.

3. **Youth vote (16-17 year olds)**: First-time voters comprise 8.4% of electorate. Historical data suggests younger voters favor Left and AfD, but unclear impact on CDU vs Greens race.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Federal CDU weakness** (26% federal polling): State elections often diverge from federal trends. Baden-Württemberg has distinct political culture.

2. **Campaign momentum**: CDU party conference in Stuttgart (Feb 20-21) could provide boost, but 17 days is short for major shifts.

3. **2016 Green comeback precedent**: Greens trailed by 7 points two months before 2016 election but won. However, current timeframe is much shorter (17 days vs 8 weeks).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Current timeframe: 17 days until March 8, 2026**

**If halved to ~8-9 days:**
- Probability would increase to ~92-93%
- Less time for late-breaking events or campaign shifts
- Polling becomes even more predictive in final week

**If doubled to ~34 days (~5 weeks):**
- Probability would decrease to ~83-85%
- More time for campaign dynamics, debates, scandals
- The 2016 Green comeback occurred over 8 weeks, so 5 weeks would allow partial replication
- However, CDU's lead is more stable (2 years) than typical pre-election volatility

**Key temporal factors:**
- German state polling within 3 weeks is historically reliable
- CDU lead has been consistent for 2 years, suggesting structural advantage
- New electoral system adds uncertainty regardless of timeframe
- Political Ash Wednesday (Feb 18) and CDU conference (Feb 20-21) are immediate events, but unlikely to cause 6+ point swings

## (d) Justification for Adjustment from Outside View

**Outside view base rate: 89%**

**Factors supporting upward adjustment (+2-3%):**
1. **Additional polling confirmation**: The AskNews articles provide multiple February 2026 sources confirming the January polling consensus. Handelsblatt (Feb 18) and SWR (Feb 17) both cite the same 29% CDU figure, increasing confidence in polling accuracy.

2. **Very short timeframe**: At 17 days, we're now in the final stretch where polling becomes highly predictive. Historical German state election polling errors within 2-3 weeks are rare.

3. **Seat projection buffer**: The 8-11 seat advantage means even a 2-3 point polling error favoring Greens would likely still leave CDU with most seats.

**Factors supporting downward adjustment (-1-2%):**
1. **New electoral system uncertainty**: Multiple sources emphasize this is the first election under the new two-vote system. Wagschal's warning about split voting affecting Greens suggests potential for unexpected seat distributions.

2. **Özdemir's personal popularity**: While party votes matter most, his 39% vs Hagel's 19% in direct preference could indicate latent Green support that might materialize in final days.

3. **Green comeback precedent**: The 2016 example shows Greens can surge late, though timeframe is much shorter now.

**Net adjustment: +1%**

The additional polling confirmation and very short timeframe slightly strengthen confidence, but the new electoral system uncertainty prevents larger upward movement. The 6-point lead with 8-11 seat buffer provides substantial cushion against normal polling error.

## Probability Calibration

**Starting point (outside view): 89%**

**Inside view adjustments:**
- Additional February polling confirmation: +2%
- Very short timeframe (17 days): +1%
- New electoral system uncertainty: -1%
- Özdemir personal popularity: -1%

**Final calibrated probability: 90%**

This represents a 9:1 odds ratio. In 10 similar scenarios with:
- 6-point polling lead
- 17 days until election
- Sustained 2-year trend
- Multiple independent polls confirming
- 8-11 seat projected buffer
- New electoral system adding uncertainty

The leading party would win most seats approximately 9 times out of 10.

A shift to 80% (4:1 odds) would require believing polling errors of 6+ points are common in German state elections (they're not) or that the new electoral system creates massive unpredictability (unlikely given proportional nature).

A shift to 95% (19:1 odds) would require dismissing the new electoral system uncertainty and assuming near-perfect polling accuracy (overconfident given unknowns).

90% appropriately balances the strong polling evidence against remaining uncertainties.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will CDU win strictly more Landtag seats than any other party in the March 8, 2026 Baden-Württemberg election, based on final official results published before May 1, 2026?
   - ✓ Analysis focuses on seat count, not vote share or coalition formation

2. **Outside view base rate**: 89% based on polling consensus, trend stability, and short timeframe
   - ✓ Final prediction (90%) is tightly anchored to this base rate with modest adjustment

3. **Consistency check**: "90 out of 100 times, CDU wins the most seats in Baden-Württemberg."
   - ✓ This aligns with strong polling evidence (CDU 29%, Greens 23%), sustained 2-year lead, 8-11 seat buffer, and 17-day timeframe

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - Multiple independent polls (SWR/Infratest, Handelsblatt) show CDU 29%, Greens 23% (6-point lead)
   - CDU lead sustained for 2 years since spring 2024, showing structural shift
   - Seat projections show 8-11 seat CDU advantage, providing buffer against polling error
   - Only 17 days until election, limiting time for major reversals
   - ✓ All verified through multiple high-quality German sources with clear methodologies

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: New electoral system produces unexpected seat distribution through split voting patterns, with voters choosing CDU candidates but Green party lists (or vice versa), creating overhang/compensatory mandates that favor Greens. Wagschal specifically warned about this. This could shift probability down to ~80-82%.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Current polling shows CDU leading - if nothing changes, CDU wins most seats. With 17 days remaining, status quo continuation is highly likely. The 90% probability appropriately reflects this low-volatility scenario while accounting for remaining uncertainties.

Probability: 90%
