Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis:**

**Primary Sources (Official/Administrative):**
- *Statistisches Landesamt Baden-Württemberg* (Feb 5, 2026): Official statistical office describing electoral procedures. High quality, factual, no polling data.
- *Baden-Württemberg.de* (Official state website): Details the new two-vote system, 120-seat minimum, and procedural requirements. High quality, purely factual.

**Historical Context (2021 Election):**
- *PISM.pl* (March 15, 2021): Analysis of 2021 election where Greens won with 32.6% vs CDU's 24.1%. Useful for understanding the baseline but 5 years old.

**Federal Election Context (2025):**
- *deutschland.de* (Feb 24, 2025): CDU/CSU won federal election with 28.5%. Relevant for national momentum but federal ≠ state dynamics.
- *The Guardian* (Sept 2021): Explains German electoral system. Educational but not specific to Baden-Württemberg 2026.

**Recent Political Context (2026):**
- *dw.com*: CDU federal polling at only 26%, party conference in Stuttgart before election. Shows federal weakness but strategic confidence in Baden-Württemberg.
- *Hungarian Conservative* (Jan 1, 2026): General overview of 2026 elections, no specific Baden-Württemberg data.
- *Morgenpost.de* (Jan 15, 2026): **Critical source** - states CDU is "significantly ahead" in polls, Manuel Hagel's "chances of becoming the next minister-president look good," mentions potential CDU-Green coalition with swapped roles. This is opinion journalism but cites polling trends.

**Agent Report (Most Critical):**
Provides detailed polling data from January 2026:
- INSA (Jan 29, 2026): CDU 29%, Greens 21%, AfD 20% → Seat projection: CDU 38, Greens 27 (+11 advantage)
- Infratest dimap (Jan 14-20, 2026): CDU 29%, Greens 23%, AfD 20% → Seat projection: CDU 38, Greens 30 (+8 advantage)

The agent report is highly detailed with methodological information and appears to synthesize multiple polling sources. The consistency between two independent polls (both showing CDU at 29% with 6-8 point leads) increases confidence. The report notes CDU has maintained this lead since spring 2024, showing stability.

**Quality Assessment:**
- Highest quality: Agent report with specific recent polling data
- Good supporting evidence: Morgenpost article confirming CDU lead
- Contextual: Federal election results, historical 2021 data
- Administrative: Official sources on electoral mechanics

(b) **Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible Reference Classes:**
1. *Baden-Württemberg state elections historically*: CDU dominated 1953-2011, Greens since 2011. Shows state can shift but changes are gradual.

2. *German state elections where incumbent party faces challenger with polling lead*: When a party leads by 6-8 points 6 weeks before election, they typically win most seats. German polling has been relatively accurate.

3. *State elections following federal momentum*: CDU won federal election Feb 2025, though federal polling has weakened. Mixed signal.

4. *Elections under new electoral systems*: The 2026 election uses a new two-vote system. New systems can produce surprises, but the proportional nature means polling should translate fairly directly to seats.

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** German state elections where one party has a consistent 6-8 point polling lead 6-8 weeks before election day. This is most directly applicable given the specific polling data available.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis:**

- Today: February 19, 2026
- Election: March 8, 2026
- Timeframe: **17 days** (approximately 2.5 weeks)

**Historical Patterns:**
- German state election polling within 3 weeks of election day tends to be quite stable
- The CDU lead has been consistent since spring 2024 (nearly 2 years)
- Major polling errors in German elections are rare but not impossible (2021 federal election was relatively accurate)
- The new electoral system adds some uncertainty to seat translation, but both polls project similar seat advantages

**Campaign Period Considerations:**
- 17 days is a short window for major shifts
- CDU party conference in Stuttgart (Feb 20-21) could provide momentum boost
- No major scandals or events reported that would disrupt current dynamics
- AfD at 20% complicates coalition math but doesn't affect CDU being largest party

(d) **Justification:**

The outside view strongly favors a CDU victory as largest party:

1. **Polling Consensus:** Two independent polls from late January 2026 both show CDU at 29% with 6-8 point leads over Greens. This translates to projected 8-11 seat advantages.

2. **Trend Stability:** The CDU has led consistently since spring 2024, suggesting this is not a temporary bounce but a sustained shift from the 2021 result (when Greens won 32.6% vs CDU 24.1%).

3. **Federal Momentum:** CDU won the February 2025 federal election, providing some tailwind despite recent federal polling weakness.

4. **Short Timeframe:** With only 17 days until election, dramatic reversals are unlikely absent major events.

5. **Electoral System:** The new two-vote system is proportional, meaning polling should translate fairly directly to seats. CDU's traditional strength in direct mandates may provide additional buffer through overhang seats.

**Risk Factors:**
- New electoral system could produce unexpected results
- Polling error (±2.8-2.9 percentage points per poll)
- Youth vote (16-17 year olds) could favor Greens
- Late campaign developments
- Coalition dynamics might affect strategic voting
- Historical upset rate in German state elections is low but non-zero

Outside view calibration:

The polling data provides a clear anchor: CDU leads by 6-8 percentage points with projected seat advantages of 8-11 seats. With 17 days remaining, I need to assess the probability this lead holds.

**Tethering to polling data:**
- If polls are accurate, CDU wins with near certainty (>95%)
- Polling error of ±3 points could narrow the gap but CDU would still likely lead
- A systematic polling miss of 6+ points favoring Greens (required for Greens to overtake) is historically rare

**Historical upset rate:**
- German state election polling within 3 weeks is generally reliable
- Major upsets (6+ point swings in final weeks) occur perhaps 5-10% of the time
- New electoral system adds uncertainty: perhaps +5% additional risk

**Calibration considerations:**
- Base probability from polls if accurate: ~95%
- Adjustment for polling error: -5%
- Adjustment for new electoral system uncertainty: -3%
- Adjustment for short timeframe limiting volatility: +2%
- Adjustment for trend stability (2-year lead): +2%

This suggests a probability in the 88-93% range. Given the consistency of two independent polls, the sustained trend, and the short timeframe, I lean toward the higher end but remain cautious about overconfidence.

The question asks specifically if CDU wins "the most seats" (not plurality government formation), which is a cleaner threshold. Even in scenarios where polling slightly underestimates Greens, CDU would likely still have most seats given the 8-11 seat projected buffer.

Outside View Prediction:
89%
