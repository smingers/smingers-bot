Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (summary, quality, what’s fact vs opinion)

1) **Statistisches Landesamt Baden-Württemberg (Feb 5, 2026)**  
- **What it is:** Official statistical office page describing election date, administration, and the *new* two-vote system.  
- **Quality:** Very high for institutional facts; **no forecasting content**.  
- **Facts used:** Election date (Mar 8, 2026), final-results timing, two-vote reform, minimum Landtag size 120.  
- **Opinions:** None.

2) **Baden-Württemberg.de / Innenministerium page (procedural) (no explicit date given here; current for 2026 election)**  
- **What it is:** Official government procedural guidance on the 2026 election and electoral reform details.  
- **Quality:** Very high for rules; **no forecasting content**.  
- **Facts used:** Two-vote system; 70 districts; Zweitstimme drives proportional seat allocation; overhang/comp seats possible; voting age 16; nomination deadlines.  
- **Opinions:** None.

3) **PISM.pl analysis of 2021 election (Mar 15, 2021)**  
- **What it is:** Think-tank commentary explaining CDU’s weak 2021 performance (mask scandals, COVID politics).  
- **Quality:** Medium/high for contextual narrative; **dated** and not directly predictive for 2026.  
- **Facts used:** 2021 environment plausibly hurt CDU; Greens led.  
- **Opinions:** Interpretations about causes/implications—use cautiously.

4) **deutschland.de on 2025 federal election (Feb 24, 2025)**  
- **What it is:** Descriptive recap of federal results (CDU/CSU plurality).  
- **Quality:** Medium for facts; relevance is **indirect** (federal ≠ state).  
- **Facts used:** CDU/CSU performed strongly federally in 2025; suggests some national tailwind potential.  
- **Opinions:** “Likely coalition” framing—minor relevance.

5) **The Guardian explainer (Sep 27, 2021)**  
- **What it is:** General explanation of German federal electoral mechanics (two votes, proportionality).  
- **Quality:** Medium; **not BW-specific**, dated.  
- **Facts used:** General intuition: list vote tends to determine proportional seats; overhang compensation typically preserves proportionality.  
- **Opinions:** Minimal; mostly educational.

6) **DW on CDU party conference in Stuttgart (Feb 2026)**  
- **What it is:** Reputable journalism focused on federal CDU dynamics; mentions federal polling softness and campaign staging.  
- **Quality:** High for reported events; relevance **indirect** to BW seat plurality.  
- **Facts used:** CDU is in federal government; party conference in BW; federal CDU polling not stellar.  
- **Opinions:** Interpretive statements about “chancellor bonus” and party momentum—use cautiously.

7) **Hungarian Conservative (Jan 1, 2026)**  
- **What it is:** Broad geopolitics/elections article; **no BW specifics**.  
- **Quality:** Low/unclear; not useful here.  
- **Facts/opinions:** Not used.

8) **Morgenpost.de (Jan 15, 2026)**  
- **What it is:** Media profile of key politicians; asserts CDU is clearly ahead in polls and Hagel has good chances.  
- **Quality:** Medium; potentially credible but mixes reporting with narrative.  
- **Facts used:** Identifies main candidates; claims CDU leading in polls (not providing its own full tables in the summary).  
- **Opinions:** “Chances look good” is commentary.

9) **Agent report (poll compilation + rule implications) (Jan 2026 polls)**  
- **What it is:** Secondary compilation of two recent polls (INSA; Infratest dimap) and an illustrative seat translation.  
- **Quality:** Mixed: the poll numbers are plausible and attributable, but **this is not a primary source** and the seat projection is explicitly simplified.  
- **Facts used (tentatively):** Two independent late-January BW polls reportedly show CDU ~29%, Greens ~21–23%, AfD ~20.  
- **Opinions/estimates:** Claims about expected extra seats (wide range) and effects; treat as uncertain.

### (b) Reference class analysis (base rates)

Plausible reference classes:

1) **Baden-Württemberg Landtag elections since 2011 (Greens era)**: Which party won the most seats?  
- Pros: Same state, similar party system.  
- Cons: Very small N (only 3 elections: 2011/2016/2021), and 2026 uses **new electoral rules**.  
- CDU “most seats” frequency in that mini-era is roughly **1/3** (CDU in 2011; Greens in 2016/2021).

2) **All Baden-Württemberg Landtag elections postwar (1950s–today)**: Which party won the most seats?  
- Pros: Same state.  
- Cons: Long structural era where CDU dominance was near-default (1953–2006), less representative of the current multi-party, Greens-led era; may overstate CDU base rate.

3) **German state elections where (a) the polling leader ~2–6 weeks before election leads by ~5–10 points** and question is simply “wins the most seats/votes”  
- Pros: Directly matches the *type of uncertainty* (late-campaign stability; polling error; turnout shocks). Larger N across states.  
- Cons: Requires generalization; also BW has new rules, but seat-plurality is still largely driven by the party-list vote.

**Most suitable reference class for an outside-view today:** (3) — “late polling leader with a mid-single-digit lead wins plurality.” This converts today’s situation into a base-rate problem about *late swings and polling error*, without leaning too hard on BW’s older political era.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Today:** 2026-02-19  
- **Election day:** 2026-03-08  
- **Time left:** ~**18 days**.

General historical pattern in mature European democracies (Germany included): with <3 weeks remaining, large vote-share reversals are uncommon; upsets mainly occur when:
- the lead is within typical polling error (often ~2–3 pp),
- there is a major late-breaking scandal/shock,
- turnout composition changes unexpectedly,
- or the polling is systematically biased.

Given that the *resolution criterion* is **most seats** (not necessarily governing coalition), volatility needs to be big enough to flip first place.

### (d) Justification for an outside-view prediction

Using the reference class “poll leader ~3 weeks out with ~5–10 point lead wins plurality”:

- The **status quo** in BW government is Green-led; but the question is not government formation—only **largest party by seats**.
- Outside-view logic says: with ~18 days left, **plurality leaders usually convert** unless the race is within error bars or disrupted by major shocks.
- The **new electoral rules** add some uncertainty about exact seat totals, but (crucially) they *increase proportionality via Zweitstimme*, which typically means: *if a party leads in vote share, it tends to lead in seats as well*. This reduces the chance that district peculiarities alone flip the seat leader.
- The main outside-view “No” pathways are therefore:
  1) CDU’s vote share advantage collapses late (campaign shock, turnout surprise),
  2) polls are off by enough to have Greens (or less plausibly AfD) actually ahead,
  3) an extremely close top-two leads to a **tie** in seats (rare but possible under proportional allocations), which would also resolve “No”.

Given typical upset rates in late-stage plurality calls, I’d expect the probability of CDU *not* being the largest party to be meaningfully above zero (late dynamics happen), but still clearly the minority outcome if the lead is real.

Outside view calibration:

- **Tether to a rough quantitative anchor from the materials:** The agent report cites two late-January polls with CDU around **29%** and Greens **~21–23%** (a ~6–8 pp lead). Even treating this only as a “situation type” (not a deterministic inside-view), this corresponds to a reference-class where late plurality conversion is high.
- **Base rate for “leader with ~6–8 pp lead at ~3 weeks wins plurality”**: I’d put this around **~85%** in comparable elections.
- **Adjustments (still outside-view):**
  - **Downward** for: limited number of recent polls shown here (only two), possible house effects, and BW’s new rules creating extra seat-allocation edge cases (including tie risk): −2 to −4 pp.
  - **Downward** for: credible chance of late Green consolidation given leadership change narratives / tactical voting (generic risk): −1 to −2 pp.
- Net: about **~82–84%**.

Outside View Prediction:
**83.1%**
