This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves as “Yes” if the final seat totals following the [2026 Baden-Württemberg state election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg_state_election) published before May 1, 2026 show the Christian Democratic Union of Germany has strictly more seats than any other party. Use the official election statistics/results published by Statistisches Landesamt Baden-Württemberg on its Landtag election page: https://www.statistik-bw.de/staat-und-gesellschaft/wahlen/landtagswahl/.

Additional fine-print:
Use final seat allocation (including any overhang/compensatory seats) as shown in the official final result available before May 1, 2026. If two or more parties tie for most seats, resolve “No”. If the primary page does not publish seat totals by May 1, 2026, resolve using credible sources per https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions.

# Summary of Article from Pism.pl (March 15, 2021)

**Disclaimer:** This article is from March 2021, discussing the 2021 Baden-Württemberg state election results, not the upcoming 2026 election that is the subject of the forecasting question.

## Key Facts and Context:

**2021 Election Results:**
- The Greens maintained their position in Baden-Württemberg with Prime Minister Winfried Kretschmann
- The article discusses potential coalition changes, with the possibility that the CDU (which had been governing with the Greens) might be replaced by the SPD and FDP in the coalition

**Reasons for CDU's Poor Performance in 2021:**
1. **"Mask scandal":** Bundestag deputies Nikolas Löbel (CDU) and Georg Nüßlein (CSU) were alleged to have collected commissions for brokering purchases of protective materials. Both resigned from the faction, with Löbel resigning his parliamentary seat.
2. **Additional corruption allegations:** MP Mark Hauptmann (CDU) resigned due to allegations of accepting money for lobbying for Azerbaijan, Taiwan, and Vietnam
3. **COVID-19 response issues:** Slow vaccination rate (only 3.3% or 2.7 million fully vaccinated by mid-March 2021) and growing impatience with lockdown extensions
4. **Government satisfaction decline:** Positive assessment dropped from 77% in April 2020 to 50% in March 2021

**Policy Tensions:**
- Disagreements between the Greens and CDU regarding COVID-19 restrictions and economic aid
- CDU criticized Kretschmann for pursuing rapid climate transformation of the car industry, particularly the goal to end internal combustion engine production in favor of electric vehicles

**Political Implications Discussed:**
- The 2021 results weakened CDU leader Armin Laschet's position and raised questions about his candidacy for chancellor
- The results strengthened the Greens' position ahead of the 2021 federal elections

## Summary of Article

**Title:** German election 2021: full results and analysis  
**Source:** The Guardian  
**Date:** September 27, 2021  
**Author:** Antonio Voce

### Key Information:

**Electoral System Explanation:**
- German voters cast two votes in Bundestag (federal parliament) elections:
  - **First vote:** Elects a direct representative for local constituency (candidate with most votes wins)
  - **Second vote:** For a party list
- Overall Bundestag membership is designed to be proportional to the second vote
- Overrepresentation from directly elected seats is compensated by adding more seats to parliament
- Parliament size can vary based on vote distribution
- Example given: If Greens get 20% of second vote, they should get very close to 20% of seats

**Threshold Rules:**
- Parties need to cross a 5% threshold in the second vote to enter parliament
- Exception: A party winning three or more seats in the first vote does not need to meet the 5% threshold
- Seats are awarded proportionally to parties that cross the threshold, based on their share of "successful" second votes

**Post-Election Process:**
- Parties typically spend weeks in coalition negotiations after elections
- Once negotiations complete, the Bundestag votes to elect the chancellor

**Sources and Methodology:**
- Exit poll source: Infratest dimap/ARD
- Official results source: German federal returning officer
- Results are 'interim' until fully collated, then become 'provisional' when returning officer announces national result

<Agent_report>
Query: Latest opinion polls for the 2026 Baden-Württemberg Landtag election including seat projections and party vote shares. Comparative polling trends since 2021 for CDU and Greens with method details. Summaries of new electoral rules affecting 2026 seat allocation.
1. Latest voting-intention numbers (February 2026)  
The two most recently published Baden-Württemberg Landtag polls agree that the CDU is clearly in first place.

a) INSA for “Bild” / Wahlrecht.de, first released 29 Jan 2026 – 1,200 interviews  
• CDU 29 % • GRÜNE 21 % • AfD 20 % • SPD 10 % • LINKE 7 % • FDP 5 % • BSW 3 % • sonst. 5 % (Wahlrecht.de, Landtagsumfragen table).

b) Infratest dimap “BW-Trend” for SWR & Stuttgarter Zeitung, field 14-20 Jan 2026, n = 1,168 (CATI/online mixed)  
• CDU 29 % • GRÜNE 23 % • AfD 20 % • SPD 8 % • LINKE 7 % • FDP 5 % • sonst. 8 % (ad-hoc-news.de, 22 Jan 2026).

Seat projection (regular 120-seat basis, parties <5 % ausgeschlossen, Sainte-Laguë proportional, no overhang assumed):

 INSA 29 Jan 26: CDU 38 | GRÜNE 27 | AfD 26 | SPD 13 | LINKE 9 | FDP 7  → CDU +11 over Greens.  
 Infratest 20 Jan 26: CDU 38 | GRÜNE 30 | AfD 26 | SPD 10 | LINKE 9 | FDP 7  → CDU +8 over Greens.

Because the CDU traditionally gewinnt den Großteil der 70 Direktmandate, Netto-Überhang führt erfahrungsgemäß zu zusätzlichen Ausgleichssitze für die übrigen Parteien; das begünstigt aber nicht die Rangfolge. Beide Umfragen implizieren, dass die CDU heute die größte Fraktion würde.

2. Trend seit der Landtagswahl 14 März 2021  
Wahlergebnis 2021: GRÜNE 32.6 %, CDU 24.1 % (Wahlrecht.de Ergebnisübersicht). Seither:

• 2022-23: erste Umfragen zum neuen Wahlrecht sahen eine enge Kopf-an-Kopf-Situation (CDU 25-27 %, GRÜNE 26-29 %, AfD ~13 %).  
• Ab Frühjahr 2024 drehte sich das Bild: die CDU überholte die GRÜNEN und baute einen Vorsprung von 4-8 Pp aus (Wahlrecht.de Umfragenchronik).  
• 2025 stabilisierte sich die Lücke bei ca. 6-8 Pp; gleich­zeitig stieg die AfD auf knapp 20 %.  
Aktueller Abstand: 6–8 Pp (siehe Jan 2026 Werte oben). Somit hat die CDU ihren Stimmanteil gegenüber 2021 um etwa +5 Pp gesteigert, während die GRÜNEN rund –9 Pp verloren haben.

3. Methodische Angaben der jüngsten Erhebungen  
INSA 29 Jan 26: kombiniertes Telefon-/Online-Panel (T-O-Mix), Stichprobe ca. 1,200, Befragungszeit 21-25 Jan (Wahlrecht.de standard-Angabe). Fehlerbereich ±2.8 Pp bei 95 %-Konfidenz.  
Infratest dimap 14-20 Jan 26: dual-frame Telefon (60 %) + Online (40 %), Stichprobe 1,168 Wahlberechtigte, Gewichtung nach Geschlecht, Alter, Region; Fehlertoleranz ±2.9 Pp (ad-hoc-news.de). Beide Institute stellen Rohdaten und Tabellen online (SWR BW-Trend-Seite).

4. Neues Wahlrecht 2026 – Kernpunkte, Relevanz für Sitzverteilung  
(Gesetz vom 26 Apr 2022; Innenministerium BW, Baden-Wuerttemberg.de; Wahlrecht.de Wahlsystem-Seite)

• Zwei Stimmen statt einer: Erststimme für 70 Wahlkreis­kandidaten (relative Mehrheitswahl), Zweitstimme für Landesliste (proportional).  
• Regelgröße Landtag 120 Sitze (70 Direkt, 50 Listen).  
• Überhang- und Ausgleichsmandate vollständig ausgeglichen; Divisorverfahren Sainte-Laguë. Infolge vieler CDU-Direktsiege erwarten Experten 20-80 Zusatzsitze; der FDP-Fraktionschef rechnet mit “200 oder mehr Abgeordneten” (MedienFokus-BW, 16 Jan 26).  
• Wahlalter erstmals ab 16 Jahren (ca. 180 000 Neu-Wähler, ntv.de, 23 Jan 26).  
• 5 %-Sperrklausel bezieht sich auf Zweitstimmen. Einzel­bewerber können mit Direktmandat auch ohne 5 % einziehen; für die Frage “größte Fraktion” spielen sie praktisch keine Rolle.

Implikationen:  
– Die Zweitstimme dominiert die Mandatszahl; aktuelle Umfragen deuten deshalb auf ein CDU-Vorsprung von 8–11 Sitzen schon ohne Überhänge.  
– CDU-Direktmandate können ihr Überhangpolster vergrößern; Ausgleichssitze erhöhen zwar das Haus, ändern aber nicht, dass die CDU die größte Fraktion bleibt, solange ihr Zweitstimmenanteil vorn liegt.  
– Das abgesenkte Wahlalter könnte tendenziell grüne Stimmen stärken, wird aber nach bisherigen Jugend-Umfragen (keine BW-Daten öffentlich) als nicht wahl-entscheidend betrachtet.

5. Bewertung hinsichtlich der Prognosefrage  
Alle öffentlich verfügbaren Januar 2026 Landtagspolls zeigen die CDU mit einem stabilen Vorsprung von 6–8 Pp vor den GRÜNEN. Übersetzt in Sitze führt dies in den beiden Szenarien um mindestens 8 Mandate. Berücksichtigt man:  
• den systematischen Vorteil der CDU bei Erststimmen,  
• die vollständige Ausgleichsmechanik, die den Rang nicht verändert,  
• historische Stabilität der CDU-Führung seit 2024,

so ist der derzeitige Evidenz-Stand eindeutig: CDU wäre nach heutigen Daten die stärkste Fraktion.

6. Offene Informationslücken  
• Keine Institut hat bislang eine veröffentlichte Sitz­projektion unter dem neuen Recht (inkl. modellierter Überhang/Ausgleich) – nur eigene Näherungen sind möglich.  
• Ein durchgehendes, frei zugängliches Zeitreihen-Dataset 2021-26 für BW ist hinter Paywalls; Wahlrecht.de listet nur Spitzendaten. Detail­punkte für die Entwicklung (Monat, Methode) wären wünschenswert.  
• Es fehlen Jugend-spezifische (16-17 J.) Wahlabsichts­daten, um die Wirkung der Wahlaltersenkung quantitativ zu bewerten.

Trotz dieser Lücken genügt das vorhandene Material, um die ursprüngliche Fragestellung – aktuelle Umfrage-lage, CDU-vs-Grüne Trend, methodische Rahmendaten und Auswirkungen der neuen Regeln – substanziell zu beantworten.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
