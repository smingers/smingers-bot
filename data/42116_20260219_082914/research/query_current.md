Analysis:
To gauge whether the CDU is likely to win the most seats in the 8 March 2026 Baden-Württemberg Landtag election, the most useful real-time information is the newest state-level opinion polling, any fresh seat projections that convert polling into expected mandates under the new rules, and late-breaking campaign developments (e.g., candidate switches, scandals, coalition signals). Therefore the queries target very recent polls (“Umfrage”), articles about projected seat distributions (“Sitzverteilung Prognose”), and general election coverage dated February 2026.
