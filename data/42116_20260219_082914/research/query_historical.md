Analysis:
To assess whether the CDU is likely to secure the most seats in the 2026 Baden-Württemberg Landtag election, the most helpful historical context is:  
1. The final seat totals from the last election (2021) to establish CDU’s recent baseline and the relative strength of the Greens, SPD, AfD, and FDP.  
2. Current and recent opinion polls specific to Baden-Württemberg that show CDU vote-share trends, head-to-head standings with the Greens, and any projected seat distributions.  
3. Information on the new electoral rules for 2026 (changes to overhang/compensatory seats, thresholds, etc.) that could influence how votes translate into seats. These three strands together give an outside view of CDU’s chances of finishing first.
