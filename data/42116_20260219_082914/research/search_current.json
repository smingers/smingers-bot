Twelve parties are contesting, including the six currently represented: SPD, Greens, FDP (in the governing coalition), CDU, AfD, and Free Voters. The Left (Die Linke) is projected to gain its first entry into the Landtag based on polls. New parties on the ballot include Volt, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), the Animal Protection Party, the Ecological-Democratic Party (\u00d6DP), and the Humanist Party. The incumbent Minister-President Alexander Schweitzer (SPD) faces CDU leader Gordon Schnieder in his first direct electoral challenge. Unlike Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, 16-year-olds cannot vote in this election; previous attempts to lower the voting age to 16 failed due to lack of two-thirds majority, with CDU and AfD opposing the change. Voters may cast ballots in person at polling stations (open from 8:00 to 18:00) or via postal ballot, requiring a request form typically found on the back of the election notification. Those who collect their ballot in person can vote immediately at the municipal office, with opening times set by individual municipalities. Each voter has two votes: one for a direct candidate (first vote) and one for a party (second vote). There are 52 constituencies, with Mainz alone holding three. In the 2021 election, SPD won 28 constituencies, CDU 23, and Greens one. On the party level, SPD received 35.7% of second votes, CDU 27.7%, Greens 9.3%, AfD 8.4%, FDP 5.5%, and Free Voters 5.4%\u2014earning them entry to the Landtag. SPD secured 39 seats, CDU 31, Greens 9, FDP 6, and AfD 6. The Free Voters lost their faction status due to internal conflict and now operate as a parliamentary group with 4 members. Among the 6 non-fractured members is a BSW representative who was elected under the Greens' banner. According to polls, BSW has no realistic chance of entering the Landtag.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 02:36 AM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/regionales/rheinland-pfalz-und-saarland/Rheinland-Pfalz-waehlt-Was-rund-um-den-22-Maerz-wichtig-ist-id30379102.html)\n\n**Political Ash Wednesday: Rhein and Hagel Sharpen CDU\u2019s Campaign Message Ahead of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Election**\nAt the Political Ash Wednesday event of the CDU Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg in Fellbach on February 18, 2026, top party figures Boris Rhein and Manuel Hagel delivered campaign speeches ahead of the March 8 Landtag election. Rhein criticized the Greens, referencing a past incident involving a cannabis plant, framing the CDU as a party of freedom opposing prohibitionist and paternalistic policies\u2014a message aimed at conservative and economically oriented voters. Manuel Hagel, the CDU's lead candidate, focused on structural issues, particularly the state\u2019s unfair burden under the L\u00e4nderfinanzausgleich, arguing that Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg contributed approximately five billion euros in 2025\u2014equivalent to '30 pints of beer per resident,' a metaphor illustrating the financial strain. He also criticized disparities in public services, noting that residents pay for childcare and education while others receive them free, undermining regional competitiveness. Hagel emphasized the CDU\u2019s historical role as a shaping force in the state and called for unity and mobilization in the upcoming election.

Fischer praised Cem \u00d6zdemir, the Green party's top candidate, as the best possible candidate, emphasizing the need for experienced and knowledgeable leaders amid multiple crises. In Fellbach, CDU politician Rhein launched a broad attack on the Greens and \u00d6zdemir, accusing them of excessive moralizing, prohibitions, and arrogance, and framing the upcoming March 8 Landtag election as a choice between freedom and restrictions. Rhein also mocked the lack of visible party affiliation on \u00d6zdemir\u2019s campaign posters, noting that few would willingly display their party on a poster. The event marks a long-standing tradition in southern Germany, with the CDU holding its gathering in Fellbach since 2003 and the Greens in Biberach since 1996. This year, the contest between the CDU and Greens is especially prominent, as both parties' top candidates are seen as genuine contenders for Minister-President. Currently, the CDU leads in polls, though the Greens have recently gained ground.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 01:31 PM\nSource:[Stuttgarter-Zeitung.de](https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.politischer-aschermittwoch-cdu-uebt-in-fellbach-scharfe-kritik-an-gruenen-spitzenkandidaten-oezdemir.534d94d4-10ee-4076-847f-533a15c64044.html)\n\n**Public Debate Over Tax-Free Overtime: A Campaign Promise or Real Reform?**\nCDU Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg's top candidate, Manuel Hagel, has proposed tax- and social security-free overtime work, sparking divided reactions among readers. Nearly half of the commentators view the proposal as a tactical election promise rather than a serious reform initiative. Critics argue that since the CDU holds governing responsibility at both federal and state levels, it has the capacity to act, yet the timing\u2014shortly before elections\u2014raises doubts about genuine implementation intent. The article notes that changes to taxes and social contributions require federal legislation, parliamentary majorities in the Bundestag, and budgetary offsetting, all of which depend on coalition agreements. Thus, the criticism focuses less on the idea itself and more on the credibility of political announcements made during election campaigns.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 01:18 PM\nSource:[Focus](https://www.focus.de/die-debatte/leserdebatte-zu-steuerfreie-ueberstunden_a34fb844-fc65-4935-82e8-464eec1682ea.html)\n\n**Political Ash Wednesday: Heated Exchange Ahead of March 8 Election in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg**\nAt the political Ash Wednesday event in Biberach, former Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer criticized CDU leader Hendrik Hagel's statement that Winfried Kretschmann's political legacy would be in 'good hands' under his leadership, calling it 'inheritance theft' and asserting that Kretschmann's legacy belongs to the people of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg and also to the Greens. Fischer praised Cem \u00d6zdemir as the best candidate possible, emphasizing the need for experienced and knowledgeable leaders amid multiple crises. In response, CDU politician Rhein launched a broadside against the Greens and \u00d6zdemir, accusing them of excessive regulation, prohibitionist policies, and condescension, and framing the upcoming March 8 Landtag election as a choice between freedom and restrictions. Rhein also mocked the minimal visibility of the Green Party logo on \u00d6zdemir's campaign posters, noting that few would willingly display their party affiliation on such materials. The political Ash Wednesday tradition in southern Germany, which brings together party leaders in cities like Biberach, Fellbach, Ludwigsburg, and Karlsruhe, has gained heightened significance this year due to the tight race between the CDU and the Greens for the position of Minister-President, with the CDU currently leading in polls but the Greens making gains.

Our editorial team invited six candidates\u2014representatives from the Green Party, CDU, SPD, FDP, AfD, and the Left Party\u2014to answer six key questions on important state-level issues. The Green Party is represented by Bennet M\u00fcller; Winfried Mack is running for re-election with the CDU, having served since 2001; Ariane Bergerhoff represents the SPD; Felix Wanke the FDP; Chris Hegel the AfD; and Carola Glaser the Left Party. All candidates responded to questions on education, economy, finances, housing, health, and security. This sixth installment of the 'Wahlpr\u00fcfsteine' series focuses on finances, specifically addressing how the candidates plan to ensure fair financial support for municipalities and districts in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, which are increasingly facing fiscal challenges.

The data visualization displays the median of all polls from the past six months, along with a statistical margin of error\u2014up to \u00b13 percentage points at 30 percent support, and lower at lower support levels. A 'Five-Percent Scenario' model assumes parties falling below the 5 percent threshold would be excluded from the state parliament, redistributing their seats proportionally. Using the median polling values, seat allocation was calculated proportionally for parties that would cross the threshold. In Rhineland-Palatinate, scheduled for March 22, 2026, the CDU is projected to be the strongest party, followed by SPD and AfD. The FDP, BSW, and Free Voters are at 4 percent, making their entry into parliament uncertain. The Left Party stands at 6 percent, just above the 5 percent threshold. In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the AfD leads significantly over the SPD, followed by CDU and the Left Party, with the Greens potentially failing to cross the 5 percent threshold. In Berlin, the CDU leads the SPD and AfD, with Mayor Kai Wegner potentially remaining in office despite criticism following a January power outage. The BSW and FDP are projected to fall short of the 5 percent threshold. In Saxony-Anhalt, the AfD leads by a wide margin over the CDU, followed by the Left Party; if the AfD receives over 40 percent, it could achieve an absolute majority. The central question ahead of the 2026 state elections is the AfD\u2019s performance, particularly in regions where it could become the strongest party\u2014currently projected in Saxony-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, highlighted in the data visualization.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 08:39 AM\nSource:[Handelsblatt](https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/wahl-in-baden-wuerttemberg-dieses-tool-zeigt-die-aktuellen-umfragewerte/100190670.html)\n\n**Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Election 2026: New Voting Rights, Key Candidates, and Poll Trends**\nThe Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state election will take place on March 8, 2026, following a five-year cycle for state parliaments in Germany. The current coalition of the Green Party and CDU, led by outgoing Minister-President Winfried Kretschmann, will conclude as he will not seek re-election. The two leading candidates to succeed him are Cem \u00d6zdemir (Greens) and Manuel Hagel (CDU). The election features a new voting system with two votes: one for a constituency candidate (first vote) and one for a party (second vote), similar to the federal level. The Landtag must have at least 120 seats, with 70 from constituencies and at least 50 from party lists. Overhang and compensatory mandates may increase the total number of seats. A major reform allows 16-year-olds to vote, provided they have resided in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg for at least three months and are registered in the voters' list. Twenty-one parties are contesting the election, including the AfD, which is excluded from coalition talks by all current parliamentary parties. The SPD has dropped to 8% in the latest BW-Trend poll (January 22, 2026), its lowest since 2001, while the Greens rose to 23% (+3), and the CDU remained strongest at 29%. The AfD fell to 20% (-1), and the FDP held at 5%. The Left Party reached 7%, potentially entering the Landtag for the first time. In direct candidate preference, \u00d6zdemir leads with 39% (\u20132), followed by Hagel at 19% (+2), and Frohnmaier at 9% (+1). Brief voting applications can be submitted until March 6, 2026, at 3 PM, with ballots due by March 8, 2026, at 6 PM. The Wahl-O-Mat was launched on February 9, 2026. Barriers to voting are addressed through accessible polling stations, Braille ballots, and the option to bring a trusted companion. Election security measures include public counting, voter verification, and monitoring for disinformation. No current threats have been reported by the state office for constitutional protection. The election is being covered by SWR and the 'Stuttgarter Zeitung'.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 03:58 PM\nSource:[swr](https://www.swr.de/swraktuell/wahlen/landtagswahl/landtagswahl-2026-faq-umfragen-fristen-briefwahl-wahlrecht-100.html)\n\n**Wahl-O-Mat for the 2026 Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Election: Which Party Fits Me?**\nThe Landtag of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg is elected every five years and has a minimum of 120 members, with additional overhang and compensation seats. At the 2021 Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state election, the Greens emerged as the strongest party with over 32 percent of the vote and continued their coalition with the CDU.

For the first time, citizens aged 16 and older are eligible to vote due to a 2022 electoral law reform. The new parliament will elect a new Minister-President, as incumbent Winfried Kretschmann, the longest-serving state premier and the only Green politician to lead a state government, will not seek re-election. In the Geislingen constituency (constituency 11), the CDU narrowly won in the 2021 election, with Nicole Razawi securing the direct mandate. The 2026 results for Geislingen will be published after vote counting in the data center. The new electoral system introduces two votes: the first vote for a candidate in the constituency, and the second vote for a party, ensuring both direct representation and proportional party representation, similar to the federal election model. The Geislingen constituency includes 27 municipalities, such as Geislingen an der Steige, Donzdorf, S\u00fc\u00dfen, and Bad \u00dcberkingen. The 2021 voter turnout was 65.7%. Preliminary results are expected around 10:00 PM on election night, with final results published afterward. \nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 08:55 AM\nSource:[S\u00dcDKURIER Online](https://www.suedkurier.de/baden-wuerttemberg/ergebnisse-geislingen-landtagswahl-baden-wuerttemberg-2026-wahlergebnisse-im-ueberblick-112973766)\n\n**New Electoral Law in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: What Changes in the 2026 State Election**\nBaden-W\u00fcrttemberg is implementing a new electoral system for its 2026 state election, allowing voters to cast two votes: one for a direct candidate and one for a party list. This reform, described as the most significant since the state's founding by CDU Interior Minister Thomas Strobl and celebrated as 'historic' by Green MP Oliver Hildenbrand, aims to improve gender representation in the state parliament. Currently, women make up only 29% of the Landtag. While some parties like the Greens (50% women on the list), the Left (58%), and the SPD (47%) have made progress, the CDU (51%) and FDP (28%) show uneven representation, and the AfD has only 7 of 60 female candidates. The Landesfrauenrat\u2019s president, Ute Mackenstedt, supports the reform but warns it won't solve structural underrepresentation without a parity law or parities-bound seat allocation. The number of members in the new Landtag is uncertain, with estimates ranging from 168 (Wagschal) to 180 (Behnke), depending on the number of parties entering and the distribution of direct and compensatory mandates. The new system may lead to overhang and compensatory mandates, especially if a party wins more direct seats than its proportional vote share entitles it to. The CDU aims to win 33 direct mandates, the Greens 14, and the AfD 3, with tight races expected in several constituencies. Political scientist Uwe Wagschal warns that split voting\u2014where voters support different parties for direct and party votes\u2014could harm the Greens if they lose direct mandates despite strong party-list support. The composition of the party lists is increasingly influenced by party apparatuses rather than local engagement, with top list positions dominated by candidates from Stuttgart and W\u00fcrttemberg. For the first time, 16- and 17-year-olds can vote, comprising 8.4% of the 7.7 million eligible voters. Their voting behavior remains uncertain, though past data shows the Left and AfD have strong support among younger voters.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 10:48 AM\nSource:[stuttgarter-nachrichten.de](https://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.neues-wahlrecht-was-bei-dieser-landtagswahl-anders-wird.359ff947-2e45-408a-ad2f-f1fbc6827d31.html)\n\n**Will Ludwigsburg Benefit from the New Electoral Law in the 2026 Landtag Election?**\nThe 2026 Landtag election in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg will operate under a new electoral system modeled after the Bundestag, where direct mandates are awarded to candidates with the most first votes in their constituencies, and additional seats are allocated via party lists based on second votes. This change is expected to significantly increase the size of the Landtag, with estimates ranging from 170 to 195 seats, and possibly exceeding 200. The new system allows voters to split their first and second votes between different parties, increasing the likelihood of discrepancies between direct and proportional representation, thereby expanding the total number of seats. The Landkreis Ludwigsburg currently has five representatives in the Landtag; in 2021, the Greens won all direct mandates, while the CDU secured two second mandates in Vaihingen and Bietigheim-Bissingen. Under the new system, parties like CDU and Greens, which may win most constituencies, will rely less on the list seats, potentially endangering incumbents like CDU\u2019s Konrad Epple (ranked 44th on the list) and Green candidate Tayfun Tok (ranked 28th), who now face uncertainty. In contrast, smaller parties such as the AfD, polling at 20% in recent surveys, stand to gain significantly\u2014AfD candidate Nikolaos Boutakoglou (ranked 14th) expects the party to win four to five direct seats and secure around 35 seats overall, giving his Ludwigsburg colleague Christoforos Tsoulopoulos (ranked 30th) a realistic chance. While some, like Tok, welcome more representatives from the region, they express concern about the political implications of increased AfD representation. The outcome depends heavily on whether the FDP surpasses the 5% threshold, which would affect overall seat distribution.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 11, 2026 01:13 PM\nSource:[stuttgarter-nachrichten.de](https://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.landtagswahl-2026-profitiert-der-kreis-ludwigsburg-vom-neuen-wahlrecht.4caed9fa-6172-4f1e-ba54-502bba097693.html)\n\n**Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Election 2026: Key Questions and Answers**\nThe Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state election (Landtagswahl) is scheduled for Sunday, March 8, 2026, with polling stations open from 8:00 to 18:00. Voters must be German citizens, at least 16 years old on the election day, and have resided in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg for at least three months. The electoral system now uses two votes: the first vote (Erststimme) selects a candidate in the voter\u2019s constituency, with the winner receiving a direct mandate; the second vote (Zweitstimme) determines the overall seat distribution based on party lists. The voting age for participating in the election has been lowered to 16, though the right to run for office (passive voting rights) remains at 18. Voters may cast only two votes\u2014one for a candidate and one for a party\u2014exceeding this limit invalidates the ballot. All eligible voters will receive a notification by February 15, 2026, and can apply for postal voting via the form on the back of the notice or online (often via QR code), with ballots needing to arrive at the local election office by 18:00 on election day. Voters must bring their notification and a valid photo ID (passport or ID card). Polling stations are typically located in schools, town halls, or community centers, with addresses listed on the notification. With Winfried Kretschmann stepping down after three terms and 15 years as Minister-President, the race is open, with leading candidates including Cem \u00d6zdemir (Greens), Manuel Hagel (CDU), Markus Frohnmaier (AfD), Andreas Stoch (SPD), Kim Sophie Bohnen (The Left), and Hans-Ulrich R\u00fclke (FDP). A party must receive at least 5% of valid Zweitstimmen nationwide to enter the Landtag. The minimum number of seats is 120, but this can increase due to overhang and compensatory mandates: if a party wins more direct mandates than its share of Zweitstimmen entitles it to, overhang mandates are created, and other parties receive compensatory mandates to balance the overall composition. Projections based on exit polls appear at 18:00, with official vote counts and first official estimates following around 18:30. The Landeszentrale f\u00fcr politische Bildung will launch its Wahl-O-Mat on February 9, 2026, allowing users to assess 38 political statements and match them to suitable parties. Photography or video recording of the completed ballot in the voting booth is strictly prohibited and can invalidate the vote.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 05:01 AM\nSource:[swp.de](https://www.swp.de/baden-wuerttemberg/landtagswahl-bw-2026-die-20-wichtigsten-fragen-und-antworten-zur-ltw-78620936.html)\n\n**Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Election: A Wave of Retirements Among Longtime Politicians**\nIn Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, 34 out of 154 sitting members of the state parliament (Landtag) are not running for re-election, meaning more than one in five legislators are retiring. Among them is Willi St\u00e4chele (74), a senior CDU member and former minister who served in the Landtag for 34 years and held multiple ministerial roles, including Finance, Europe, Agriculture, and Federal Council affairs. He stepped down after the State Constitutional Court ruled the EnBW sale he oversaw as unconstitutional. Of the current 43 CDU members, 28% are leaving. The Greens are losing one-third of their 57 members, including Petra H\u00e4ffner (61), who served as chair of the Education Committee for 15 years. The SPD is seeing 22% of its 18 members retire, including Martin Rivoir (65), a long-serving member and former Finance Committee chair, and Daniel Born (50), who left after a scandal involving a swastika drawn on a secret ballot. The AfD faces the highest turnover, with 41% (7 out of 17) departing, including prominent figures like Bernd G\u00f6gel, former party leader and faction chair. Silvia Hapke-Lenz (FDP) is notable for being the shortest-serving member, having joined only 7.5 months prior on September 11, 2025. Regierungsmitglieder from the CDU are all seeking re-election, including Innenminister Thomas Strobl, who previously failed to win his Heilbronn constituency in 2016 and 2021. Wolfgang Reinhart (CDU, 70), who has been in the Landtag since April 24, 1992, will likely become the new Alterspr\u00e4sident, surpassing Peter Hauk (CDU), who joined on April 27, 1992, due to the earlier official date of his appointment. The new Landtag will be convened by the member with the longest tenure, as defined by the date of signing the parliamentary oath.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 09:56 AM\nSource:[Stuttgarter-Zeitung.de](https://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.landtagswahl-in-baden-wuerttemberg-isch-over-fuer-welche-politiker-das-jetzt-gilt.c2181e17-1ad8-4723-9a34-bb7e1869fbec.html)\n\n**2026 Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Election: These MPs May Lose Their Seats**\nA representative survey by Infratest dimap, conducted for S\u00fcdwestrundfunks (SWR) and the Stuttgarter Zeitung, indicates that several established Landtagsabgeordnete in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg may lose their seats in the 2026 state election on March 8. The FDP is projected to receive only 5% of the vote, which would yield eight seats\u2014insufficient to secure Timm Kern (Hechingen/M\u00fcnsingen, Listplatz 11) or Dennis Birnstock (N\u00fcrtingen, Listplatz 16) a seat despite their list positions. In 2021, the FDP received 10.5%, which would have ensured their re-election. Ronja Nothofer-Hahn (SPD, Reutlingen, Listplatz 14) is also at risk, as the SPD is at an all-time low of 8% and may only secure 13 seats. Her colleagues Tim Reeth (N\u00fcrtingen, Platz 37) and Yannik Hummel (Hechingen/M\u00fcnsingen, Platz 43) are not expected to win a seat. Sebastian Geyer (FDP, Reutlingen), Clara Meier (Die Linke, N\u00fcrtingen), Sonja Schneiderat (Die Linke, Hechingen/M\u00fcnsingen), and AfD candidates Alexander Gr\u00e4ff (Hechingen/M\u00fcnsingen) and Felix Schneider (N\u00fcrtingen) are not protected by list positions and must win their direct mandates. The Greens and CDU are in a stronger position: the Greens are projected at 23% (39 seats), with Cindy Holmberg (Hechingen/M\u00fcnsingen, Platz 13), Thomas Poreski (Reutlingen, Platz 16), and Clara Schweizer (N\u00fcrtingen, Platz 21) likely returning or entering. The CDU leads with 29% (49 seats), with Manuel Hailfinger (Hechingen/M\u00fcnsingen, Platz 29) and Maren Steege (N\u00fcrtingen, Platz 37) expected to retain their seats; Maximilian Menton (Reutlingen, Platz 45) depends on the CDU maintaining its lead. In the worst-case scenario for the FDP\u2014failing to cross the 5% threshold\u2014Ronja Nothofer-Hahn (SPD) and Jessica Knapp (Die Linke, Reutlingen) could enter the Landtag. In that case, the CDU would have 51 seats, Greens 41, AfD 35, SPD 14, and Die Linke 12.

Voters will elect members of the 18th legislative term of the Landtag, which will run from 2026 to 2031. The current Landtag consists of 154 members: 57 from the Greens, 43 from the CDU, 18 each from the SPD and FDP, 17 from the AfD, and one independent. Voters will cast two votes: one for a constituency representative (first vote) and one for a party list (second vote), with the second vote determining seat allocation and power distribution. The next Minister-President will not be elected directly by the public but chosen by the Landtag based on coalition negotiations. Current front-runners are CDU leader Manuel Hagel (37) and Greens' top candidate Cem \u00d6zdemir (60). The AfD\u2019s Markus Frohnmaier has no realistic chance of becoming Minister-President due to coalition infeasibility. The SPD is led by Andreas Stoch, the FDP by Hans-Ulrich R\u00fclke, and the Left Party is entering the Landtag for the first time with strong prospects. Key issues include immigration (declining in urgency), education, vocational training, and the struggling automotive industry, which is a central theme across all party platforms.
