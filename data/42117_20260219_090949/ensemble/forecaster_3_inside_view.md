Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Resolves “Yes” if official final seat totals for the 8 Mar 2026 Baden‑Württemberg Landtag election (published before 1 May 2026) show AfD has strictly more seats than any other party; ties resolve “No”.

(a) Source analysis (what each says; quality/date; facts vs opinions)
- Tagesschau/SWR (Feb 2026): Reports BW-Trend polling with AfD ~20% (3rd), contextualizes AfD as extremist-suspect case; notes all other parties rule out cooperation. High-quality public broadcaster; polling fact vs politician rhetoric/opinions clearly separable.
- SWR FAQ explainer (Feb 17, 2026): Summarizes election rules + BW-Trend (CDU 29, Greens 23, AfD 20, FDP 5, Left 7, SPD 8). High-quality; mostly factual.
- Spiegel (Feb 9, 2026): Background/Wahl-O-Mat; cites polling ranges with CDU leading (~29) and AfD around ~20 (near Greens). Good mainstream outlet; polling presented as approximate.
- Handelsblatt (Feb 18, 2026): Polling overview/averages; CDU ~29 leads; Greens and AfD behind; includes MoE discussion and “5% scenario” seat projection framing. High-quality business paper; method described at high level.
- Stuttgarter Nachrichten (Feb 16 & Feb 11, 2026): Detailed reporting on new electoral law and seat effects (overhang/compensatory), incl. expectations like CDU aiming many direct mandates and AfD relatively few; also contains candidate quotes (self-interested). Strong local reporting; some forward-looking claims are inherently uncertain.
- Stuttgarter Zeitung / Welt / Zeit / N-tv (Feb 18, 2026): Frohnmaier traveling to US right-wing conferences just before election; repeats AfD polling ~20, behind CDU/Greens. Reputable outlets; mostly factual trip reporting plus contextual commentary.
- Stuttgarter Nachrichten + YouGov survey (Jan 25, 2026): Public opinion on “Brandmauer”/cooperation; not directly about vote share. Methodologically credible (YouGov); relevance indirect.
- Merkur.de (Jan 22, 2026) & Badische Zeitung (Jan 19, 2026) & t-online/Merkur Wahl-O-Mat explainers: Summarize polling/landscape; mixed-depth, generally mainstream. Useful but largely derivative.
- Campact blog (Feb 2, 2026): Advocacy/opinion emphasizing “ignored potential”; uses arithmetic about absolute voter counts. Clear bias; factual numbers may be right but inference is advocacy.
- DW & The Local (Dec 2025 / general 2026): Broad national framing; little BW-specific seat forecasting. Moderate quality; limited direct relevance.
- Kurier (Feb 19, 2026): Notes AfD education/homeschooling theme; mostly descriptive, not BW-specific polling driver. Moderate relevance.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence:
- Polling convergence near election: Multiple independent, reputable polls/roundups (SWR BW‑Trend; Spiegel; Handelsblatt) put CDU ~29% and AfD ~20% (generally 3rd, sometimes tied for 2nd but not 1st). With ~17 days left, this heavily favors CDU being largest party by votes and thus seats.
- Structural factors under new electoral system: Local reporting explains direct-mandate strength for CDU/Greens vs AfD and resulting overhang/compensatory dynamics. This is an institutional mechanism that, if anything, makes it harder (not easier) for AfD to end up largest in seats without first being clearly largest in Zweitstimmen.

Moderate evidence:
- Outlier risk / polling error: Prior Ipsos outlier (mentioned in outside-view materials) suggests some volatility. But no current evidence of a late AfD surge to first.
- FDP near 5% and Left around/above threshold: Threshold outcomes can change seat distributions at the margin. However, threshold effects typically reshuffle among non-leading parties; they rarely flip “largest party” unless the race is already extremely close at the top.

Weak evidence:
- Campaign events (family employment story; Frohnmaier US trip): Could shift a point or two, but direction is ambiguous and magnitude likely small.
- “Absolute vote potential” arguments (Campact): Not a seat-winning mechanism; seats depend on relative shares, not raw number of supporters.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time to election day: ~17 days (from Feb 19 to Mar 8, 2026). Time to official-final seat totals: up to ~10 weeks (to May 1), but the outcome is essentially locked on election night aside from formal finalization.
- If timeframe were halved (~8–9 days left): I’d become even more confident in “No” absent evidence of a breaking shock; late swings of ~9+ points to overtake CDU are rare.
- If timeframe were doubled (~34 days left): Slightly higher upset probability (more time for shocks/re-alignments), but still constrained by the large CDU lead and AfD’s weak direct-mandate position.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside-view base rate)
Outside view base rate given: 3%.

Status quo, if trends persist:
- CDU remains clearly first (~29%); AfD remains ~20% (third or near-tied second). Under proportional allocation with the new system, AfD would need to be the top party in Zweitstimmen to plausibly be top in seats; and CDU’s expected direct-mandate strength adds a further headwind for AfD on seats.

What needs to happen for “Yes”:
- A large late swing or polling miss that moves AfD from ~20% to clearly above CDU (~29%), or a major asymmetric turnout/late-decider break combined with an unusually large polling error—plus not being offset by seat mechanics that still advantage CDU’s constituency wins.

Given the current, late-stage polling convergence and the structural seat-mechanics disadvantage for AfD versus CDU in constituencies, I move slightly downward from 3% to reflect that the most recent information looks more stabilizing than destabilizing.

Probability calibration
- Starting point (outside view): 3%.
- Adjustments:
  - Polling convergence with ~17 days left + no sign of AfD leading: down ~0.7 pp.
  - Seat-mechanics headwind (direct mandates/overhang likely favor CDU/Greens): down ~0.3 pp.
  - Residual uncertainty (new system first use; threshold parties; tail risk of a shock): up ~0.0–0.2 pp.
Net inside-view probability: ~2%.

Checklist:
1) Criteria alignment: “Yes” only if AfD has strictly most final seats; ties “No”; official results before May 1, 2026.
2) Outside view base rate: 3%.
3) Consistency check: 2 out of 100 times, AfD ends with strictly most seats—rare but not impossible.
4) Key evidence (3–5):
   - BW‑Trend/SWR: CDU ~29 vs AfD ~20 (late-stage gap).
   - Multiple mainstream roundups (Spiegel/Handelsblatt) consistent: AfD not leading.
   - New electoral rules + expected direct-mandate dominance by CDU/Greens likely worsen AfD seat path.
   - FDP near 5%/Left ~7% changes margins but unlikely to flip largest party.
5) Blind spot scenario: A major late-breaking scandal or national security/economic shock shifting conservative protest voters massively to AfD + polling systematically missing it; would push probability upward (perhaps into ~5–10%).
6) Status quo outcome: CDU largest party; modest nudge toward “No” is warranted given limited time and stable polling.

Probability: 2%
