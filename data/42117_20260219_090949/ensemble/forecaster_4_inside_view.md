Analysis:
0. Framing (≤30 words) – The question asks whether, on the final certified seat count after the 8 Mar 2026 Baden-Württemberg Landtag election, AfD will have strictly more seats than every other party. If AfD merely ties for first, outcome = No.

(a) Source analysis (quality, fact/opinion, date)
• SWR BW-Trend poll 22 Jan 2026 – Methodologically transparent telephone/online poll (n≈1200). Factual: CDU 29 %, Greens 23 %, AfD 20 %. High quality, very recent.  
• Spiegel 9 Feb 2026 – Cites same BW-Trend plus other reputable pollsters; places AfD joint-third. Factual polling; opinions minimal; high-quality mainstream outlet.  
• Handelsblatt 18 Feb 2026 – Aggregated poll average, identical numbers (CDU 29, Greens ≈22, AfD 20). Provides margin-of-error discussion. High quality, 1 day old.  
• Tagesschau 18 Feb 2026 – Reports AfD 20 %, CDU main opponent. High-quality public broadcaster.  
• Stuttgarter-Nachrichten 25 Jan 2026 – YouGov survey about coalition attitudes; AfD still at 20 %. Reputable, but online panel; lower methodological transparency.  
• Campact blog 2 Feb 2026 – Advocacy site, argues “western potential”; factual polling quoted correctly but commentary is opinion; medium–low weight.  
• AskNews items (Feb 18–19 2026) – Multiple outlets on Frohnmaier US trip; confirm AfD ~20 % and third place. Factual; minor event news.  
• Official statistics office & BW election pages – Purely procedural; very high quality.

(b) Evidence analysis (strength classification)
Strong evidence  
1. Three independent, methodologically solid polls in the last four weeks show AfD around 20 %, 8-10 points behind CDU – structural, consistent.  
2. New two-vote PR system means seat shares will track second-vote percentages; large constituency bonuses are impossible.  
3. Historic record: in zero West-German state elections has AfD led the seat count; in Baden-Württemberg it won 9.7 % in 2021.

Moderate evidence  
4. Ipsos January leak (AfD 26, CDU 23) is a single, unverified outlier – suggests ceiling could be higher but reliability limited.  
5. “Firewall” against AfD eroding (YouGov attitude poll) – could boost tactical AfD voters but causal chain indirect.

Weak evidence  
6. Frohnmaier’s US trip media visibility – anecdotal, unlikely to swing ≥8 pts.  
7. Speculation about shy-AfD polling error – past BW polling error was <1 ppt in 2021; little empirical support.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Election is 17 days away; certification about six weeks after. Halving the window (one week to election) would further lower upset probability because campaigns have little time to move ≥9 pts. Doubling (five weeks) would marginally raise risk but still leave AfD a heavy under-dog.

(d) Justification / Inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base rate (2.9 %) assumes “rare western upset” without current numbers. Present evidence shows AfD still 8-10 pts behind the CDU and narrowly behind Greens.  
Key drivers that could overturn this:
• Late migration/security shock hurting CDU/Greens. (Low probability in 17 days)  
• Systematic 4-5 ppt polling understatement of AfD plus 4-5 ppt over-statement of CDU. Historic BW errors suggest ~±2 ppt 1-σ; a combined 9-ppt miss is <1 % likely.  
• Massive differential turnout. 16-/17-year-old enfranchisement probably disadvantages AfD (youth lean Green/Left), not helps.

Combining: strong evidence pushes probability well below the outside-view 2.9 %. I reduce to 1.5 %. That still leaves room for a black-swan scandal or gross polling failure.

Probability calibration
If status-quo polling stands, AfD loses almost every simulation. ±10 % relative shift in the forecast (to 1.65 % or 1.35 %) would not change strategic conclusions; only ≥5 % headline probability would suggest a material upset risk.

Checklist:
1. Title paraphrased & criteria considered – yes.  
2. Outside view = 2.9 %; inside view rooted and explained – yes.  
3. Consistency line – “Roughly 2 out of 100 times AfD ends with most seats.” – makes sense.  
4. Top evidence (≤20 words each):  
   • Three recent high-quality polls put AfD 9 pts behind CDU.  
   • New PR seat system mirrors vote share, limiting constituency surprises.  
   • No precedent for AfD largest party in any western state.  
   • Polling error in 2021 BW was <1 ppt.  
5. Blind-spot – A late, explosive CDU funding scandal days before election causing vote free-fall. Could raise AfD win chance to ~10 %.  
6. Status-quo bias checked – maintained; nudged slightly toward “No” outcome.

Probability: 1.5%
