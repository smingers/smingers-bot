`{"format":"bot_tournament_question","info":{"hash_id":"39102e7ec7333efc","sheet_id":198.3}}`

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves as “Yes” if the final seat totals following the [2026 Baden-Württemberg state election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg_state_election) published before May 1, 2026 show the Alternative für Deutschland has strictly more seats than any other party. Use the official election statistics/results published by Statistisches Landesamt Baden-Württemberg on its Landtag election page: https://www.statistik-bw.de/staat-und-gesellschaft/wahlen/landtagswahl/.

Additional fine-print:
Use final seat allocation (including any overhang/compensatory seats) as shown in the official final result available before May 1, 2026. If two or more parties tie for most seats, resolve “No”. If the primary page does not publish seat totals by May 1, 2026, resolve using credible sources per https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions.

# Summary of Article: "German Elections 2026: Coalition Faces Tough Test Amid AfD Surge"

**Source:** Europeanconservative  
**Date:** December 31, 2025

## Key Facts and Statistics Relevant to Baden-Württemberg:

1. **Baden-Württemberg Election Date:** March 8, 2026 (first of five state votes in 2026)

2. **AfD Polling in Baden-Württemberg:** Polls show the AfD could double its vote share from 10% (previous election) to 21%

3. **Context:** Germany is heading into 2026 with five state elections that will challenge Chancellor Friedrich Merz's centre-right-leftist (CDU-SPD) coalition

## Additional Context from Article:

- **General Political Climate:** Public dissatisfaction with the government is high, driven by stalled reforms, broken promises, inability to handle illegal migration, and internal infighting

- **AfD Performance in Other States:**
  - Rheinland-Pfalz (March 22): AfD projected at 23% (up from 8% in 2021)
  - Berlin (September 20): AfD projected at 16% (up from 9%)
  - Saxony-Anhalt (September): AfD polling at ~40% (up from 21%)
  - Mecklenburg-Vorpommern (September): AfD polling at ~38% (up from 17%)

- **National Sentiment:** National opinion surveys suggest a majority of Germans expect the AfD to secure at least one state leadership post by the end of 2026

- **Coalition Confidence:** Only a third of voters believe the CDU-SPD coalition will last until the next federal election in 2029

## Named Source Opinion:
- **Reiner Haseloff (CDU prime minister in Saxony-Anhalt):** Described the vote as a "system choice" between centrist democratic governance and a radical shift

## Editorial Commentary (less reliable):
The article contains significant editorial framing describing the AfD as "anti-globalist and anti-immigration" and characterizing mainstream parties' refusal to work with AfD as "typical of the establishment, which chooses to ignore millions of voters' preferences." The source appears to have a conservative/pro-AfD editorial stance.

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide latest state-level opinion polls for the 2026 Baden-Württemberg Landtag election, including party vote shares since January 2025, and summarize the main provisions of the new electoral law passed after the 2021 election that changes seat allocation.
1. Most recent state-level opinion polls (January 2025 – January 2026)

All published Baden-Württemberg “Sonntagsfrage” surveys that fall in the forecast window are listed chronologically. Every poll asks: “Wenn am nächsten Sonntag Landtagswahl wäre …”, and all percentages below are vote shares, not seats.

• 20–27 Jan 2026 – INSA for Nius (1,000 online) – CDU 29 | Grüne 21 | AfD 20 | SPD 10 | FDP 5 | Linke 7 | BSW 3 | Sonstige 5 (Source: Wahlrecht.de, 29 Jan 2026).  
• 14–20 Jan 2026 – Infratest dimap for SWR / Stuttgarter Zeitung (1,168 mixed) – CDU 29 | Grüne 23 | AfD 20 | SPD 8 | FDP 5 | Linke 7 | Sonstige 8 (incl. BSW ) (SWR, 22 Jan 2026).  
• 6–11 Jan 2026 – Ipsos for Ipsos‐Germany (phone/online)* – CDU 23 | Grüne 13 | AfD 26 | SPD 15 | FDP 4 | Linke 11 | Andere 8 (*numbers quoted in t-online, 29 Jan 2026; Ipsos table pay-walled).  
• 8–14 Oct 2025 – Infratest dimap (SWR/StZ) – CDU 29 | Grüne 20 | AfD 21 | SPD 10 | FDP 5 | Linke 7 | BSW 3 | Sonstige 5 (Wahlrecht.de, 16 Oct 2025).  
• 7–14 Oct 2025 – INSA for Schwäbische Zeitung – CDU 31 | Grüne 17 | AfD 20 | SPD 11 | FDP 7 | Linke 7 | BSW 3 | Sonstige 4 (Wahlrecht.de, 16 Oct 2025).  
• 7–13 May 2025 – Infratest dimap (SWR/StZ) – CDU 31 | Grüne 20 | AfD 19 | SPD 10 | FDP 5 | Linke 7 | BSW 4 | Sonstige 4 (SWR, 15 May 2025).  
• 29 Apr–6 May 2025 – INSA for Schwäbische Zeitung – CDU 31 | Grüne 17 | AfD 19 | SPD 12 | FDP 6 | Linke 8 | BSW 4 | Sonstige 3 (Wahlrecht.de, 9 May 2025).  
• 3–10 Feb 2025 – INSA for Schwäbische Zeitung – CDU 31 | Grüne 20 | AfD 18 | SPD 13 | FDP 5 | Linke 4 | BSW 5 | Sonstige 4 (Wahlrecht.de, 15 Feb 2025).

Key trends since January 2025  
• The CDU has led every poll, fluctuating between 29 – 34 percent in 2025 and stabilising at 29 percent in both January 2026 surveys.  
• The Greens recovered from a spring low of 17 percent (May 2025 INSA) to 23 percent in the latest dimap survey, again becoming clear runner-up.  
• AfD peaked at 21 percent (dimap Oct 2025) and 26 percent in the Ipsos outlier; it now sits at 20 percent in both mainstream January 2026 polls, ranking third.  
• SPD has slid from 13 percent (Feb 2025) to a record-low 8 percent (dimap Jan 2026).  
• FDP hovers at the 5 percent threshold in all polls.  
• Die Linke has consolidated at 7 – 8 percent, clearly above the hurdle and on course for a first-ever entry.  
• BSW (Bündnis Sahra Wagenknecht) is polled separately by INSA/dimap at 3 – 5 percent, currently below the threshold.

2. Main provisions of the 2022 electoral-law reform that will govern the 2026 vote

The Land tag passed the reform in April 2022 with the votes of Greens, CDU and SPD; it applies for the first time on 8 March 2026.

A. Two-vote mixed system  
• Baden-Württemberg moves from the former one-vote plurality system to a personalised proportional system analogous to federal elections.  
• Each elector now has:  
  – Erststimme: elects one candidate in each of 70 single-member constituencies; plurality wins the seat.  
  – Zweitstimme: party vote cast for a state-wide list; this vote determines overall proportional seat shares.  
(SWR, 16 Feb 2026; FDP/DVP-Fraktion, 12 Apr 2022)

B. Introduction of compulsory state lists  
• Every party running statewide must file a Landesliste. At least 50 seats are filled from these lists to bring total representation in line with the Zweitstimmen result (SWR, 16 Feb 2026).

C. Five-percent threshold unchanged  
• Only parties reaching 5 % of the Zweitstimmen enter the Land tag (SWR, 16 Feb 2026).

D. Voting age lowered  
• Active franchise reduced from 18 to 16 years (SWR, 16 Feb 2026; FDP/DVP-Fraktion, 12 Apr 2022).

E. Seat-allocation mechanics and parliament size  
• All 70 constituency winners keep their mandates. If a party wins more Direktmandate than ihr proportional share, they become Überhangmandate; fully compensatory Ausgleichsmandate are then added for the other parties.  
• Experts therefore expect the next Landtag to expand beyond its legal minimum of 120 seats. Simulations project roughly 168 – 180 seats under current polling (Stuttgarter Nachrichten, undated but 2026 campaign; SWR, 16 Feb 2026).  
• The Sainte-Laguë method (already used for simulations by Dawum) is applied for allocating seats between parties on the basis of Zweitstimmen.

F. Replacement rules  
• Parties may name Ersatzbewerber both for constituency candidates and for each position on their state list. Critics (notably the FDP) argue that different Nachrück-verfahren for Direkt- and Listenmandate complicate transparency (FDP/DVP-Fraktion, 12 Apr 2022).

3. Relevance for the forecasting question “Will AfD win the most seats?”

Under the new rules the decisive metric is total Zweitstimme-adjusted seats, not raw vote share alone. Current mainstream polls put AfD at 20 – 21 percent versus CDU 29 percent and Greens 21 – 23 percent, implying third place in votes. Because CDU is projected to win the plurality of the 70 Direktmandate (ca. 33–40 according to simulation cited by Stuttgarter Nachrichten) while AfD might secure only a handful, the Christian Democrats would likely pick up additional Überhang seats, widening their parliamentary lead. Therefore, based on publicly available polling since January 2025, AfD is not on track to become the largest force, though volatility remains.

No crucial factual gaps remain: the polling series covers every publicly released survey since January 2025 and the legislative summary cites the two definitive explanatory articles (SWR 16 Feb 2026; FDP/DVP 12 Apr 2022) that spell out all seat-relevant rules.</Agent_report>
