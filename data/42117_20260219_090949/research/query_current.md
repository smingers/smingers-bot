Analysis:
The key to forecasting whether the Alternative für Deutschland (AfD) will win the most seats is up-to-date polling and credible seat projections specific to Baden-Württemberg under the new election law. Useful information includes:
• State-level voting-intention polls (“Sonntagsfrage”) conducted since the electoral reform came into force.  
• Media or academic seat simulations converting current polls into projected Landtag seats.  
• Reports on party splits, scandals, or candidate issues that might sharply move AfD support.  
• Commentary on how the revised proportional system (thresholds, overhang/compensatory seats) could advantage or disadvantage AfD relative to CDU, Greens, SPD, FDP, etc.  
Because the election is only weeks away (8 Mar 2026), the most relevant news will be from the last few days or weeks. Reputable German polling institutes (Infratest dimap, Forsa, Forschungsgruppe Wahlen, INSA) and regional outlets (Stuttgarter Zeitung, SWR, Badische Zeitung) are prime sources. Legislative analysis from Statistisches Landesamt or state interior ministry may also clarify seat-allocation mechanics. Therefore, queries will target late-breaking polls, seat projections, and expert commentary about AfD prospects in Baden-Württemberg.
