Analysis:
To judge AfD’s chances of securing the most seats in Baden-Württemberg in 2026 I need (a) the party’s historic vote/seat shares in the state (especially 2021 and 2016 elections), (b) all reputable opinion polling since 2024 showing its current standing relative to the CDU and the Greens (the two traditional front-runners), and (c) clear explanations of the new electoral rules adopted after 2021 (introduction of open lists, changes in overhang/compensatory seat formulas, possible impact on small vs. large parties). These three strands give an outside-view baseline and the most recent trajectory.
