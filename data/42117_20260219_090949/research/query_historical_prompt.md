This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves as “Yes” if the final seat totals following the [2026 Baden-Württemberg state election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Baden-W%C3%BCrttemberg_state_election) published before May 1, 2026 show the Alternative für Deutschland has strictly more seats than any other party. Use the official election statistics/results published by Statistisches Landesamt Baden-Württemberg on its Landtag election page: https://www.statistik-bw.de/staat-und-gesellschaft/wahlen/landtagswahl/.

Additional fine-print:
Use final seat allocation (including any overhang/compensatory seats) as shown in the official final result available before May 1, 2026. If two or more parties tie for most seats, resolve “No”. If the primary page does not publish seat totals by May 1, 2026, resolve using credible sources per https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic or financial data, add a FRED query. Use a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate") or a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE"). Returns historical data with computed statistics.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one Agent query.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant historical context needed to generate an outside view.}
