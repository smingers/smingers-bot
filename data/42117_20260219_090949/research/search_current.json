No other state saw such success for this extremist party at the time.\n\n## Author's Analysis (Opinion):\n\nThe author argues that media and political discourse focuses excessively on AfD's eastern German success (40% in Sachsen-Anhalt) while ignoring the western potential. The author contends that absolute voter numbers matter more than percentages, and that Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg's larger population means AfD could gain significantly more actual votes there. The piece suggests this focus on \"the East\" represents a form of denial about right-wing extremism in western Germany and normalizes xenophobic rhetoric.\n\n**Note:** This is an opinion piece from Campact Blog (a progressive advocacy organization), so the analysis reflects the author's political perspective rather than neutral reporting.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.spiegel.de/politik/deutschland/wahl-o-mat-fuer-baden-wuerttemberg-2026-wen-sie-in-den-landtag-waehlen-wollen-a-0bfd3a37-6116-4f64-ae9c-1d0333e0def2\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Wahl-O-Mat f\u00fcr Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg 2026: Wen Sie in den Landtag w\u00e4hlen wollen\"\n\n**Source:** Spiegel.de  \n**Date:** February 09, 2026  \n**Author:** DER SPIEGEL\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- **Election date:** March 8, 2026\n- **Total eligible voters:** Approximately 7.7 million in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg\n- **Number of parties competing:** 21 parties total\n\n### Current Polling Data (as of article publication):\n- **CDU:** 29% (leading)\n- **Gr\u00fcne (Greens):** ~20-23% (6-8 percentage points behind CDU)\n- **AfD:** ~20% (tied with Greens)\n- **SPD:** ~10%\n- **Die Linke (The Left):** 7%\n- **FDP:** Uncertain whether they will clear the 5% threshold\n\n### Notable Political Context:\n\n- Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg has been governed by a Green-Black (Gr\u00fcne-CDU) coalition for nearly a decade\n- Current Minister President Winfried Kretschmann (Greens) is not running again after nearly 15 years in office\n- **Cem \u00d6zdemir** (Greens, former federal minister) is seeking to succeed Kretschmann\n- **Manuel Hagel** (CDU, 37 years old, state party chairman and parliamentary group leader) could become the youngest head of government in state history if successful\n- **Markus Frohnmaier** (AfD, foreign policy spokesperson for the federal parliamentary group) is being promoted on posters as \"Minister President 2026,\" though he is not on any list position\n- All other parties in Stuttgart reject cooperation with Frohnmaier/AfD\n\n### Electoral System Changes:\n- New electoral system being used for the first time, featuring both a first vote for direct candidates and a second vote for state lists (similar to federal elections)\n- Voting age lowered to 16 years\n\n### Campaign Issues:\nDespite the Greens' established presence, the campaign focuses less on climate and more on economic policy and security in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\n\n### Additional Context:\nThe article primarily introduces the Wahl-O-Mat tool (38 theses for voters to position themselves on) rather than providing extensive polling analysis.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.dw.com/en/germanys-far-right-afd-may-seize-regional-power-in-2026/a-75133782\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Germany's far-right AfD may seize regional power in 2026\"\n\n**Source:** dw.com | **Author:** Hans Pfeifer\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Elections scheduled:** Five German state elections will be held in 2026:\n   -

seeking overall control rather than coalitions\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n1. **Alena Buyx** (medical ethicist, former president of German Ethics Council): At a Federal Criminal Police Office conference, stated that \"perfectly ordinary colleagues and friends\" are considering leaving Germany after \"the second glass of wine\"\n\n2. **Karin Prien** (Education Minister, CDU): Announced in October she would leave Germany if the AfD becomes part of the federal government (note: her Jewish great-grandmother was murdered by the Nazis)\n\n3. **Hans-Thomas Tillschneider** (AfD deputy parliamentary group leader in Saxony-Anhalt): In written response to DW, stated:\n   -

\"It is very clear that the party sees the eastern German states as a political laboratory to test how far it can go in challenging democratic culture\"\n   - Goal is to challenge the federal government\n   - AfD benefits from constant societal stress from coronavirus pandemic, economic challenges, and Russia's attack on Ukraine\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- The AfD's Saxony-Anhalt branch has been officially deemed \"definitely right-wing extremist\" and a threat by that state's security authorities\n- Court rulings increasingly attest to the unconstitutional nature of AfD factions\n- In Thuringia, the AfD has already used political power to block appointment of judges to key positions\n- An AfD-led state government would have representation on national committees for police, intelligence work, and the Federal Council\n\n**Note:** This article focuses primarily on eastern German states (particularly Saxony-Anhalt) where AfD is strongest.

He described schools as being entangled in a 'senseless fight against the right' and questioned why parents should be forced to send their children to this 'state monopoly.' The AfD proposes introducing a right to homeschooling, or 'non-school, home-based learning,' citing Austria as an example of a country with a 'education obligation' rather than a 'school obligation.' Although the AfD's proposal was rejected twice in Brandenburg, the party continues to push for school obligation reform nationwide. The issue has become a central theme in AfD campaigns, particularly in Saxony-Anhalt where an AfD minister-president is a realistic possibility in the September election, and in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, where the party's platform calls for loosening the school obligation ahead of the March 8 state election.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 04:34 AM\nSource:[Kurier](https://kurier.at/politik/ausland/feindbild-schule-afd-schulpflicht-deutschland-lockern-forderung-oesterreich-home-schooling/403132683)\n\n**Rheinland-Pfalz & Saarland: Rheinland-Pfalz Holds State Election Amid Political Shifts and Voting Reforms**\nRheinland-Pfalz holds its state election on March 22, 2026, with approximately 2.95 million eligible voters choosing 101 members for the new Landtag. Twelve parties are contesting, including the six currently represented: SPD, Greens, FDP (in the governing coalition), CDU, AfD, and Free Voters. The Left (Die Linke) is projected to gain its first entry into the Landtag based on polls. New parties on the ballot include Volt, the Sahra Wagenknecht Alliance (BSW), the Animal Protection Party, the Ecological-Democratic Party (\u00d6DP), and the Humanist Party. The incumbent Minister-President Alexander Schweitzer (SPD) faces CDU leader Gordon Schnieder in his first direct electoral challenge. Unlike Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, 16-year-olds cannot vote in this election; previous attempts to lower the voting age to 16 failed due to lack of two-thirds majority, with CDU and AfD opposing the change. Voters may cast ballots in person at polling stations (open from 8:00 to 18:00) or via postal ballot, requiring a request form typically found on the back of the election notification. Those who collect their ballot in person can vote immediately at the municipal office, with opening times set by individual municipalities. Each voter has two votes: one for a direct candidate (first vote) and one for a party (second vote). There are 52 constituencies, with Mainz alone holding three. In the 2021 election, SPD won 28 constituencies, CDU 23, and Greens one. On the party level, SPD received 35.7% of second votes, CDU 27.7%, Greens 9.3%, AfD 8.4%, FDP 5.5%, and Free Voters 5.4%\u2014earning them entry to the Landtag. SPD secured 39 seats, CDU 31, Greens 9, FDP 6, and AfD 6. The Free Voters lost their faction status due to internal conflict and now operate as a parliamentary group with 4 members. Among the 6 non-fractured members is a BSW representative who was elected under the Greens' banner. According to polls, BSW has no realistic chance of entering the Landtag.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 02:36 AM\nSource:[N-tv](https://www.n-tv.de/regionales/rheinland-pfalz-und-saarland/Rheinland-Pfalz-waehlt-Was-rund-um-den-22-Maerz-wichtig-ist-id30379102.html)\n\n**AfD's Frohnmaier Travels to U.S. Right-Wing Conference Ahead of Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Election**\nMarkus Frohnmaier, the AfD's top candidate for the Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state election, is traveling to the 'Turning Point Action' conference in Washington, D.C., shortly before the March 8, 2026, state election.

Our editorial team invited six candidates\u2014representatives from the Green Party, CDU, SPD, FDP, AfD, and the Left Party\u2014to answer six key questions on important state-level issues. The Green Party is represented by Bennet M\u00fcller; Winfried Mack is running for re-election with the CDU, having served since 2001; Ariane Bergerhoff represents the SPD; Felix Wanke the FDP; Chris Hegel the AfD; and Carola Glaser the Left Party. All candidates responded to questions on education, economy, finances, housing, health, and security. This sixth installment of the 'Wahlpr\u00fcfsteine' series focuses on finances, specifically addressing how the candidates plan to ensure fair financial support for municipalities and districts in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, which are increasingly facing fiscal challenges.

The data includes a margin of error: at 30 percent support, the actual value could vary by up to \u00b13 percentage points. The distribution of seats in the state parliament is projected using a 'Five-Percent Scenario,' where parties below the 5 percent threshold would be excluded, redistributing their potential seats. In Rhineland-Palatinate, the CDU is projected to be the strongest party, followed by the SPD and AfD, with the FDP, BSW, and Free Voters hovering near the 4 percent threshold and the Left Party at 6 percent\u2014just above the 5 percent hurdle. In Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, the AfD leads significantly ahead of the SPD, CDU, and Left Party, though the Greens may fall below the 5 percent threshold. In Berlin, the CDU leads the SPD and AfD, with Mayor Kai Wegner potentially retaining his position despite criticism over the January power outage; however, BSW and FDP are projected to fall short of the 5 percent threshold. In Saxony-Anhalt, the AfD leads the CDU and Left Party, and if it surpasses 40 percent, it could achieve an absolute majority. A central question ahead of the 2026 state elections is the AfD\u2019s performance, particularly given its classification as right-extremist in parts of the political spectrum. The AfD is projected to be the strongest party in both Saxony-Anhalt and Mecklenburg-Vorpommern, as indicated by color-coded highlights in the accompanying graphic.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 08:39 AM\nSource:[Handelsblatt](https://www.handelsblatt.com/politik/deutschland/landtagswahlen-2026-das-sind-die-aktuellen-umfragewerte-in-baden-wuerttemberg/100190670.html)\n\n**Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Election 2026: New Voting Rights, Key Candidates, and Poll Trends**\nThe Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state election will take place on March 8, 2026, following a five-year cycle for state parliaments in Germany. The current coalition of the Green Party and CDU, led by outgoing Minister-President Winfried Kretschmann, will conclude as he will not seek re-election. The two leading candidates to succeed him are Cem \u00d6zdemir (Greens) and Manuel Hagel (CDU). The election features a new voting system with two votes: one for a constituency candidate (first vote) and one for a party (second vote), similar to the federal level. The Landtag must have at least 120 seats, with 70 from constituencies and at least 50 from party lists. Overhang and compensatory mandates may increase the total number of seats. A major reform allows 16-year-olds to vote, provided they have resided in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg for at least three months and are registered in the voters' list. Twenty-one parties are contesting the election, including the AfD, which is excluded from coalition talks by all current parliamentary parties. The SPD has dropped to 8% in the latest BW-Trend poll (January 22, 2026), its lowest since 2001, while the Greens rose to 23% (+3), and the CDU remained strongest at 29%. The AfD fell to 20% (-1), and the FDP held at 5%. The Left Party reached 7%, potentially entering the Landtag for the first time. In direct candidate preference, \u00d6zdemir leads with 39% (\u20132), followed by Hagel at 19% (+2), and Frohnmaier at 9% (+1). Brief voting applications can be submitted until March 6, 2026, at 3 PM, with ballots due by March 8, 2026, at 6 PM. The Wahl-O-Mat was launched on February 9, 2026. Barriers to voting are addressed through accessible polling stations, Braille ballots, and the option to bring a trusted companion. Election security measures include public counting, voter verification, and monitoring for disinformation. No current threats have been reported by the state office for constitutional protection.

The interactive tool includes 38 statements, allowing users to respond with 'agree', 'neutral', or 'disagree'. It covers major parties such as CDU, SPD, Greens, FDP, AfD, and Die Linke, as well as numerous smaller parties and voter associations. Manuel Hagel of the CDU and Cem \u00d6zdemir of the Greens are leading candidates for Minister President, while incumbent Winfried Kretschmann is not running for re-election. The Wahl-O-Mat does not issue voting recommendations but serves as an informational aid. Notably, this election marks the first time 16- and 17-year-olds in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg can vote, making the tool particularly useful for youth engagement. The election also launches Germany\u2019s Superwahljahr 2026. According to Merkur.de, the tool is available free of charge and was developed by the Landeszentrale f\u00fcr politische Bildung Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 02:35 PM\nSource:[Merkur.de](https://www.merkur.de/politik/wahl-mat-fuer-landtagswahl-bw-2026-parteien-wahlalter-termine-94172660.html)\n\n**New Electoral Law in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg: What Changes in the 2026 State Election**\nBaden-W\u00fcrttemberg is implementing a new electoral system for its 2026 state election, allowing voters to cast two votes: one for a direct candidate and one for a party list. This reform, described as the most significant since the state's founding by CDU Interior Minister Thomas Strobl and celebrated as 'historic' by Green MP Oliver Hildenbrand, aims to improve gender representation in the state parliament. Currently, women make up only 29% of the Landtag. While some parties like the Greens (50% women on the list), the Left (58%), and the SPD (47%) have made progress, the CDU (51%) and FDP (28%) show uneven representation, and the AfD has only 7 of 60 female candidates. The Landesfrauenrat\u2019s president, Ute Mackenstedt, supports the reform but warns it won't solve structural underrepresentation without a parity law or parities-bound seat allocation. The number of members in the new Landtag is uncertain, with estimates ranging from 168 (Wagschal) to 180 (Behnke), depending on the number of parties entering and the distribution of direct and compensatory mandates. The new system may lead to overhang and compensatory mandates, especially if a party wins more direct seats than its proportional vote share entitles it to. The CDU aims to win 33 direct mandates, the Greens 14, and the AfD 3, with tight races expected in several constituencies. Political scientist Uwe Wagschal warns that split voting\u2014where voters support different parties for direct and party votes\u2014could harm the Greens if they lose direct mandates despite strong party-list support. The composition of the party lists is increasingly influenced by party apparatuses rather than local engagement, with top list positions dominated by candidates from Stuttgart and W\u00fcrttemberg. For the first time, 16- and 17-year-olds can vote, comprising 8.4% of the 7.7 million eligible voters. Their voting behavior remains uncertain, though past data shows the Left and AfD have strong support among younger voters.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 10:48 AM\nSource:[stuttgarter-nachrichten.de](https://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.neues-wahlrecht-was-bei-dieser-landtagswahl-anders-wird.359ff947-2e45-408a-ad2f-f1fbc6827d31.html)\n\n**Will Ludwigsburg Benefit from the New Electoral Law in the 2026 Landtag Election?**\nThe 2026 Landtag election in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg will operate under a new electoral system modeled after the Bundestag, where direct mandates are awarded to candidates with the most first votes in their constituencies, and additional seats are allocated via party lists based on second votes. This change is expected to significantly increase the size of the Landtag, with estimates ranging from 170 to 195 seats, and possibly exceeding 200. The new system allows voters to split their first and second votes between different parties, increasing the likelihood of discrepancies between direct and proportional representation, thereby expanding the total number of seats. The Landkreis Ludwigsburg currently has five representatives in the Landtag; in 2021, the Greens won all direct mandates, while the CDU secured two second mandates in Vaihingen and Bietigheim-Bissingen. Under the new system, parties like CDU and Greens, which may win most constituencies, will rely less on the list seats, potentially endangering incumbents like CDU\u2019s Konrad Epple (ranked 44th on the list) and Green candidate Tayfun Tok (ranked 28th), who now face uncertainty. In contrast, smaller parties such as the AfD, polling at 20% in recent surveys, stand to gain significantly\u2014AfD candidate Nikolaos Boutakoglou (ranked 14th) expects the party to win four to five direct seats and secure around 35 seats overall, giving his Ludwigsburg colleague Christoforos Tsoulopoulos (ranked 30th) a realistic chance. While some, like Tok, welcome more representatives from the region, they express concern about the political implications of increased AfD representation. The outcome depends heavily on whether the FDP surpasses the 5% threshold, which would affect overall seat distribution.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 11, 2026 01:13 PM\nSource:[stuttgarter-nachrichten.de](https://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.landtagswahl-2026-profitiert-der-kreis-ludwigsburg-vom-neuen-wahlrecht.4caed9fa-6172-4f1e-ba54-502bba097693.html)\n\n**Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg Landtag Election: Majority Oppose AfD Cooperation Despite Openness to Case-by-Case Alliances**\nA YouGov survey conducted from January 14 to 22, 2026, among 1,028 eligible voters in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, found that 42% of respondents oppose any cooperation with the AfD, while 24% believe other parties should decide case-by-case whether to collaborate with the AfD, and 26% support general coalition possibilities with the party. This represents a decline from February 2025, when 47% supported a 'firewall' (Brandmauer) against the AfD, indicating shifting public sentiment. Despite public openness to potential cooperation, all major parties in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg have formally ruled out working with the AfD, which the state Office for the Protection of the Constitution classifies as a right-wing extremist suspect. The AfD, led by Bundestag member Markus Frohnmaier\u2014who campaigns as a 'Minister-President candidate' but has no realistic chance of winning\u2014expects to become the largest opposition party, polling at 20% in current surveys. While 20% of respondents favor a CDU-AfD coalition, the CDU has repeatedly rejected such a possibility. Support for a CDU-Green coalition is at 21%, while a CDU-SPD-FDP 'Germany coalition' garners 13% and a Green-SPD-FDP 'traffic light' coalition only 7%. Over half of respondents either prefer no coalition or have no opinion. Additionally, 28% of respondents believe it is important for the FDP to remain in the state parliament, despite current polling showing the party barely above the 5% threshold and only 38% considering its presence important. The survey has a margin of error between 1.3 and 3.1 percentage points, and like all opinion polls, is subject to uncertainties due to weakening party loyalty and last-minute voting decisions.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 25, 2026 03:00 AM\nSource:[stuttgarter-nachrichten.de](https://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.landtagswahl-in-baden-wuerttemberg-umfrage-jeder-zweite-im-suedwesten-gegen-brandmauer-zur-afd.dbb04caa-5444-44ac-8d97-2699404ee0b4.html)\n\n**AfD Aims for Best-ever Result in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Election, According to Polls**\nThe AfD is preparing for its third Landtagswahl (state election) in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg, with current polls indicating a significant improvement in its performance compared to previous elections. In 2021, the AfD received 9.7% of the vote and secured 17 seats, making it the weakest parliamentary faction. Recent surveys suggest the party is now polling around 20%, marking its strongest result to date in the region. However, despite this upward trend, the AfD is not expected to become the largest party in the upcoming 2026 election, as CDU and the Greens remain ahead in the polls. The party's support has grown from 15% in December 2024 to approximately 20% in early 2026. While polls carry a margin of error of up to \u00b13 percentage points, recent German polling accuracy has been high\u2014averaging only 0.95 percentage points off in the 2021 state election, according to Dawum. Thus, current projections are considered reliable indicators of the likely outcome. The election is scheduled for March 2026.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 03:17 PM\nSource:[Merkur.de](https://www.merkur.de/politik/umfragen-vor-landtagswahl-bw-2026-erste-afd-prognosen-94135106.html)\n\n**What You Need to Know About the 2026 Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg State Election**\nThe 2026 Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg state election will be held on March 8, 2026, marking the end of Winfried Kretschmann's tenure as Minister-President, who has led the state since 2011. Voters will elect members of the 18th legislative term of the Landtag, which will run from 2026 to 2031. The current Landtag consists of 154 members: 57 from the Greens, 43 from the CDU, 18 each from the SPD and FDP, 17 from the AfD, and one independent. Voters will cast two votes: one for a constituency representative (first vote) and one for a party list (second vote), with the second vote determining seat allocation and power distribution. The next Minister-President will not be elected directly by the public but chosen by the Landtag based on coalition negotiations. Current front-runners are CDU leader Manuel Hagel (37) and Greens' top candidate Cem \u00d6zdemir (60). The AfD\u2019s Markus Frohnmaier has no realistic chance of becoming Minister-President due to coalition infeasibility. The SPD is led by Andreas Stoch, the FDP by Hans-Ulrich R\u00fclke, and the Left Party is entering the Landtag for the first time with strong prospects. Key issues include immigration (declining in urgency), education, vocational training, and the struggling automotive industry, which is a central theme across all party platforms. A major change in voting law allows 16- and 17-year-olds to vote for the first time, expanding the electorate to approximately 7.7 million eligible voters.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 19, 2026 03:10 AM\nSource:[Badische Zeitung](https://www.badische-zeitung.de/was-man-zur-landtagswahl-2026-im-suedwesten-wissen-muss)\n\n**XXL Landtag in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg? New Dual-Vote Electoral System Sparks Debate**\nBaden-W\u00fcrttemberg will introduce a new dual-vote electoral system for the 2026 state election, allowing 16- and 17-year-olds to vote for the first time. The reform, passed by the Green Party, CDU, and SPD, aims to increase representation of women and young people in the Landtag. Under the new system, parties will use state-level lists to strategically place candidates, with the Greens and SPD implementing a consistent alternating gender order (woman, man, woman, man). The CDU, FDP, and AfD use fewer women on their lists. The current Landtag already exceeds the minimum size of 120 seats due to overhang and compensatory mandates. Critics warn the new system could further expand the Landtag, especially due to vote splitting (different parties chosen for first and second votes), which may increase overhang and compensatory mandates. The FDP opposes the system due to concerns over more constituencies, while the AfD and SPD worry about increased influence of state party leaderships over second-vote members. Despite significant criticism, the use of the controversial Palantir police software has been approved in Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: November 16, 2025 04:46 PM\nSource:[mannheim24.de](https://www.mannheim24.de/baden-wuerttemberg/xxl-landtag-neues-wahlrecht-baden-wuerttemberg-landtagswahl-zwei-stimmen-aenderung-stuttgart-zr-94040297.html)\n\n**Commission to Reform Federal Election Law Can Begin Work**\nGermany\u2019s coalition agreement has established a commission to reform the federal election law. The commission, comprising four CDU, four SPD and two CSU members, will start work immediately. According to the article, it will evaluate the 2023 reform and submit amendments within the year. Its mandate includes ensuring that every candidate who wins a majority of first votes can enter the Bundestag, maintaining the size at 630 seats, guaranteeing equal representation of women, and considering lowering the voting age to 16. The commission\u2019s members are: CDU \u2013 Steffen Bilger, Catarina dos Santos\u2011Wintz, Michael Brand, Andreas Jung; CSU \u2013 Alexander Dobrindt, Alexander Hoffmann; SPD \u2013 Johannes Fechner, Sebastian Hartmann, Stefanie Hubig, Nancy Faeser. The article notes that the 2023 reform reduced the Bundestag from 736 to 630 seats and eliminated overhang and balancing mandates. It also reports that 23 constituencies failed to return a member because the winning candidate did not have a second\u2011vote majority, affecting 15 CDU, 3 CSU, 4 AfD and 1 SPD representatives, and leaving three Baden\u2011W\u00fcrttemberg and one Hessen constituencies unrepresented. Markus S\u00f6der of the CSU called the reform a 'massive Manipulation' and 'absolut verfassungswidrig', but the Federal Constitutional Court ruled it largely constitutional.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 09:39 AM\nSource:[Legal Tribune Online](https://www.lto.de/recht/nachrichten/n/wahlrecht-bundestag-kommission-hubig-dobrindt-und-faeser-sind-dabei)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
