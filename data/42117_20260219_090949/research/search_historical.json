Main provisions of the 2022 electoral-law reform that will govern the 2026 vote\n\nThe Land tag passed the reform in April 2022 with the votes of Greens, CDU and SPD; it applies for the first time on 8 March 2026.\n\nA. Two-vote mixed system  \n\u2022 Baden-W\u00fcrttemberg moves from the former one-vote plurality system to a personalised proportional system analogous to federal elections.  \n\u2022 Each elector now has:  \n  \u2013 Erststimme: elects one candidate in each of 70 single-member constituencies; plurality wins the seat.  \n  \u2013 Zweitstimme: party vote cast for a state-wide list; this vote determines overall proportional seat shares.  \n(SWR, 16 Feb 2026; FDP/DVP-Fraktion, 12 Apr 2022)\n\nB. Introduction of compulsory state lists  \n\u2022 Every party running statewide must file a Landesliste. At least 50 seats are filled from these lists to bring total representation in line with the Zweitstimmen result (SWR, 16 Feb 2026).\n\nC. Five-percent threshold unchanged  \n\u2022 Only parties reaching 5 % of the Zweitstimmen enter the Land tag (SWR, 16 Feb 2026).\n\nD. Voting age lowered  \n\u2022 Active franchise reduced from 18 to 16 years (SWR, 16 Feb 2026; FDP/DVP-Fraktion, 12 Apr 2022).\n\nE. Seat-allocation mechanics and parliament size  \n\u2022 All 70 constituency winners keep their mandates. If a party wins more Direktmandate than ihr proportional share, they become \u00dcberhangmandate; fully compensatory Ausgleichsmandate are then added for the other parties.  \n\u2022 Experts therefore expect the next Landtag to expand beyond its legal minimum of 120 seats. Simulations project roughly 168 \u2013 180 seats under current polling (Stuttgarter Nachrichten, undated but 2026 campaign; SWR, 16 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 The Sainte-Lagu\u00eb method (already used for simulations by Dawum) is applied for allocating seats between parties on the basis of Zweitstimmen.\n\nF. Replacement rules  \n\u2022 Parties may name Ersatzbewerber both for constituency candidates and for each position on their state list. Critics (notably the FDP) argue that different Nachr\u00fcck-verfahren for Direkt- and Listenmandate complicate transparency (FDP/DVP-Fraktion, 12 Apr 2022).\n\n3. Relevance for the forecasting question \u201cWill AfD win the most seats?\u201d\n\nUnder the new rules the decisive metric is total Zweitstimme-adjusted seats, not raw vote share alone. Current mainstream polls put AfD at 20 \u2013 21 percent versus CDU 29 percent and Greens 21 \u2013 23 percent, implying third place in votes. Because CDU is projected to win the plurality of the 70 Direktmandate (ca. 33\u201340 according to simulation cited by Stuttgarter Nachrichten) while AfD might secure only a handful, the Christian Democrats would likely pick up additional \u00dcberhang seats, widening their parliamentary lead. Therefore, based on publicly available polling since January 2025, AfD is not on track to become the largest force, though volatility remains.\n\nNo crucial factual gaps remain: the polling series covers every publicly released survey since January 2025 and the legislative summary cites the two definitive explanatory articles (SWR 16 Feb 2026; FDP/DVP 12 Apr 2022) that spell out all seat-relevant rules.</Agent_report>\n"
