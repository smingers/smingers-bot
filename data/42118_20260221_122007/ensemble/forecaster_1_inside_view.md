Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**Bernama (Jan 20, 2026)**: High-quality Malaysian government news agency. Confirms election logistics, one minor complaint received, orderly process. Factual, pre-election reporting. No indication of serious irregularities.

**The Star (Jan 24, 2026)**: Credible Malaysian newspaper. Reports voting proceeded "without disruption" across all 36 polling centres. Factual reporting of election day events.

**Malay Mail (Jan 24, 2026)**: Credible Malaysian newspaper. Confirms candidates, voter numbers, expected results by 10pm. Factual pre-result reporting.

**The Star (Jan 6-10, 2026)**: Multiple credible articles covering nomination process, candidate details, campaign analysis. Factual with some expert opinion from named academics (Lee Kuok Tiung, Tony Paridi Bagang). No mention of anticipated legal challenges.

**Malay Mail/Malaysiakini (Dec 2025)**: EC announcement articles confirming election scheduling. High quality, factual.

**Wikipedia – 2025 Sabah State Election**: Useful background on political context. Confirms hung assembly, political tensions. No specific Lamag annulment information.

**AskNews articles on DAP congress**: Multiple credible sources (The Star, Free Malaysia Today, Malay Mail) covering DAP's internal political crisis following Sabah election losses. These are factual reports about DAP's response to poor Sabah performance. Not directly relevant to Lamag annulment but confirm political turbulence in the region.

**LAmag.com article**: Entirely irrelevant (Los Angeles publication). Disregard.

**No sources** report any election petition filed against the Lamag by-election result, any EC investigation, or any court proceedings related to the January 24, 2026 result.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence toward No:**
- Multiple independent credible sources (The Star, Malay Mail, Bernama) confirm the election proceeded without disruption or serious incidents
- Historical precedent: Zero Malaysian elections overturned within 97 days of polling (structural/institutional factor)
- Only one confirmed successful Malaysian election annulment in ~15 years (Kemaman 2023), taking ~10 months
- No reports of election petitions filed against Lamag result in any available source
- The election was a relatively clean straight fight (BN vs Warisan) with no extraordinary circumstances reported

**Moderate evidence toward No:**
- The political environment (Warisan vs BN) doesn't suggest aggressive post-election litigation; Warisan's support base in Lamag was described as "narrow and fragmented"
- EC described process as "orderly, smooth and without any serious incidents"
- By-elections triggered by death tend to be cleaner contests

**Weak evidence toward Yes (hypothetical):**
- One complaint was received on January 20 (pre-election), details unknown — but EC chairman described it as non-serious
- Political tensions in Sabah post-2025 state election could motivate challenges
- The Sindumin 2025 petition precedent shows Sabah actors are willing to file petitions

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The resolution window is February 21 to May 1, 2026 — approximately 69 days from question opening. The election was January 24, 2026, giving ~97 days total from polling to resolution deadline.

Malaysian election petition procedure requires filing within 21 days of result (deadline ~February 14, 2026 — already past as of today, February 21). If no petition was filed by February 14, the question resolves No by default. Even if filed, adjudication within the remaining window is essentially unprecedented.

**If timeframe were halved (~48 days from now):** Probability would remain essentially the same (~1-2%) — the bottleneck is procedural impossibility, not time.

**If timeframe were doubled (~138 days from now, to ~July 2026):** Probability might rise marginally to 3-5%, as court proceedings could theoretically progress further, but still very unlikely given Malaysian judicial timelines for election petitions.

**(d) Justification**

The outside view base rate of ~1.5% is already very low. The inside view evidence strongly reinforces this:

1. **No evidence of filed petitions**: The 21-day filing deadline (approximately February 14, 2026) has already passed as of today (February 21). No credible source reports any petition being filed. This is the most critical factor — without a filed petition, resolution is essentially impossible.

2. **Orderly election conduct**: Multiple sources confirm no serious incidents. The EC chairman explicitly described the process as orderly. This reduces the probability of successful grounds for annulment.

3. **Procedural impossibility**: Even if a petition were somehow filed (perhaps within a court-extended deadline), Malaysian election courts have never resolved a petition within 97 days of polling. The Kemaman case — the only successful annulment — took ~10 months.

4. **Political context**: DAP's focus on internal reform (congress, government role review) and Warisan's acknowledged weak position in Lamag suggest the losing party is unlikely to pursue aggressive litigation.

The combination of the filing deadline having passed, no reports of petitions, orderly election conduct, and structural procedural constraints makes this essentially a near-certain No resolution.

I will lower my estimate slightly from the 1.5% outside view to approximately 1.5% — the outside view already accounts for unknown unknowns. There is no inside view evidence that warrants upward adjustment, and the filing deadline having passed provides mild downward pressure. I'll maintain ~1.5% to account for scenarios where: a petition was filed that I'm unaware of, an extraordinary EC action occurs, or some other unforeseen mechanism triggers annulment.

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view base rate is 1.5%. Inside view evidence is uniformly negative (no petitions, orderly election, filing deadline passed). The structural constraint (97-day window never having been sufficient for Malaysian election annulment) is strong. I'll set my final probability at **1.5%**, unchanged from the outside view, as the inside view confirms rather than contradicts the base rate.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will the Lamag by-election result (Jan 24, 2026) be annulled or re-run ordered by a court/EC before May 1, 2026, changing the winning party? ~97-day window.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 1.5% — zero Malaysian elections overturned within 97 days; ~1 successful annulment in 15 years total.

3. **Consistency check**: "1.5 out of 100 times, the Lamag by-election result is officially overturned before May 1, 2026." This aligns with my analysis — extremely unlikely given procedural constraints and no evidence of petitions.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Filing deadline (~Feb 14) has passed with no reported petitions (strong No)
   - Election described as orderly by EC chairman (strong No)
   - Zero Malaysian elections overturned within 97 days historically (strong No)
   - Only 1 successful annulment in 15 years of Malaysian elections (strong No)
   - No credible source mentions any legal challenge to Lamag result (strong No)

5. **Blind-spot**: A petition was secretly filed before February 14 and is proceeding through courts — this could make my forecast look wrong. Even so, adjudication within ~69 remaining days is essentially unprecedented. Might shift probability to 3-4%.

6. **Status quo**: Status quo is the result stands. The world changes slowly; no forces are visible pushing toward annulment.

Probability: 1.5%
