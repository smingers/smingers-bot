Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Wikipedia – 2026 Lamag By-Election**: Confirms the by-election was scheduled for January 24, 2026, triggered by Bung Moktar Radin's death. Results section is empty/incomplete. No mention of legal challenges. Moderate quality for background facts; incomplete for outcomes.

2. **Wikipedia – 2023 Kuala Terengganu By-Election**: Historical precedent showing Malaysian election courts can and do annul results on corruption grounds. High quality for establishing that annulments are possible but rare.

3. **PAS Won't Appeal (Astro Awani, Oct 2023)**: Confirms the Kemaman annulment precedent. Credible news source. Relevant for establishing base rates.

4. **Bernama – Logistics Article (Jan 20, 2026)**: Pre-election logistics piece. Confirms the election was proceeding normally with only one minor complaint. High-quality government news agency source.

5. **Malay Mail – GRS Sitting Out (Dec 21, 2025)**: Pre-election coalition strategy. No mention of disputes or challenges. Credible source.

6. **Thai Election Article (The Star, Feb 18, 2026)**: Entirely irrelevant to Lamag. Disregard.

7. **Agent Report**: Comprehensive analysis of Malaysian election annulments since 2010. Key finding: only ONE confirmed successful annulment (Kemaman, 2023), which took ~10 months. The 97-day window (Jan 24 to May 1, 2026) has never been sufficient for a Malaysian election petition to be filed, heard, and adjudicated. Sabah-specific: no confirmed annulments; Sindumin 2025 petition pending. The agent report is well-reasoned and internally consistent, though it relies on secondary sources.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes are available:

- **All Malaysian election petitions since 2010**: Very few succeed (~1 confirmed in ~15 years across hundreds of elections). Base rate of successful annulment: extremely low (~1-2% of contested seats, and far fewer of all seats).

- **Malaysian elections overturned within 97 days of polling**: Zero confirmed cases. The fastest known annulment (Kemaman) took ~10 months.

- **By-elections triggered by death (not contested results)**: These tend to be cleaner contests with less pre-existing litigation motivation. Lower petition risk than contested general elections.

- **Sabah state elections specifically**: Active petitioning environment (Sindumin 2025), but no confirmed successful annulments in the dataset.

The most suitable reference class is **Malaysian elections overturned within ~3 months of polling**, which has a historical rate of approximately 0% based on available evidence.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The resolution window is February 21 to May 1, 2026 — approximately 69 days from question opening, and ~97 days from the election itself. Malaysian election petition procedure requires:
- Filing within 21 days of result (deadline ~Feb 14, 2026)
- Service of pleadings
- Preliminary hearings
- Full trial
- Judgment

The Kemaman case (the only successful annulment) took ~10 months. No Malaysian election petition has been resolved within 97 days. Even if a petition was filed by the deadline, adjudication within the remaining window is essentially unprecedented.

**(d) Justification**

The base rate of successful election annulments in Malaysia is very low (roughly 1 confirmed case in ~15 years of elections). The specific constraint of resolution within 97 days of polling reduces this probability to near-zero based on historical precedent. There are no reports of election petitions filed against the Lamag by-election result, no unusual circumstances (the election was described as orderly), and the political environment in Lamag does not suggest aggressive petitioning (the 2025 state election petition was threatened but withdrawn). The Election Commission cannot unilaterally annul results. The question requires not just a petition but an actual annulment or re-run order that changes the winning party/coalition — an even higher bar.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate from the reference class "Malaysian elections overturned within 97 days" is effectively 0/N (zero occurrences). Even broadening to "any successful Malaysian election annulment" gives roughly 1 in hundreds of elections (~0.5-1%). The 97-day constraint makes this even less likely. There are no known filed petitions against the Lamag by-election result. I should not go below ~1% to account for unknown unknowns (e.g., a petition was filed that I'm unaware of, or some extraordinary EC action). The probability should be in the 1-2% range. Given the absolute procedural impossibility of completing petition proceedings in this timeframe based on all historical evidence, I'll anchor toward the lower end.
