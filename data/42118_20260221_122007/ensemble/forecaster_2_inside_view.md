Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Bernama logistics briefing (Jan 20, 2026)** – High quality, official EC source. Confirms the by-election proceeded with only one minor complaint, orderly process, no serious incidents. Factual, directly relevant.

2. **The Star / Malay Mail – Polling day reports (Jan 24, 2026)** – High quality mainstream Malaysian outlets. Confirm voting proceeded without disruption across all 36 centres. No irregularities reported. Factual.

3. **Malay Mail / The Star – Nomination and pre-election coverage (Jan 6-10, 2026)** – High quality. Establish the candidates (BN vs Warisan straight fight), context of the by-election. No legal controversies flagged.

4. **Wikipedia – 2025 Sabah State Election** – Moderate quality. Provides political context (hung assembly, GRS-PH pact, Warisan as opposition). No mention of Lamag-specific legal challenges.

5. **AskNews articles on DAP congress, indigenous land rights, Melaka election** – These are entirely unrelated to the Lamag by-election annulment question. Zero evidentiary weight for resolution.

6. **Sinchew/Sinar Harian weather articles** – Irrelevant to resolution.

7. **LAmag.com article** – Completely unrelated (Los Angeles publication). Zero weight.

**Key factual finding**: No source from January 24, 2026 through February 21, 2026 mentions any election petition, legal challenge, or annulment proceedings related to the Lamag by-election result.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence toward No:**
- Multiple independent, high-quality sources (Bernama, The Star, Malay Mail) confirm the by-election proceeded without serious incidents or irregularities. This is the strongest structural factor against any petition succeeding.
- The Lamag contest was a straight BN vs Warisan fight with no third-party grievances. Fewer contestants = fewer potential petitioners.
- Zero reports of any election petition being filed in the ~4 weeks since polling day (Jan 24 to Feb 21, 2026). The 21-day filing window has likely closed or is closing.
- Historical record: No Malaysian by-election result has been annulled within 70 days of polling. No Sabah state seat has been annulled in recent memory.

**Moderate evidence toward No:**
- The previous Lamag seat (2025 state election) had a narrow 153-vote margin, yet no petition was pursued then. The 2026 by-election context is similarly low-contention.
- Only one complaint was received during the entire pre-polling period, described as minor and procedural.

**Weak evidence toward Yes (speculative):**
- Remote polling logistics (helicopter/boat transport) theoretically create procedural vulnerabilities, but no specific irregularities were reported.
- The political environment (hung Sabah assembly, Warisan opposition) creates some incentive to challenge results, but no evidence this has materialized.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

- **Window remaining**: From today (Feb 21, 2026) to resolution (May 1, 2026) = 69 days.
- **Statutory petition filing**: Under Malaysian election law, petitions must be filed within 21 days of gazettal. Results were announced Jan 24; gazettal likely occurred within 1-2 weeks (by ~Feb 7). Filing deadline has almost certainly passed (~Feb 28 at latest).
- **If window halved (35 days)**: Probability would be even lower—essentially zero, as no court could adjudicate in that time.
- **If window doubled (140 days)**: Still extremely low (~0.1%), as even the fastest Malaysian election petition took 6+ months to resolve.
- The timeframe is the binding constraint: even if a petition were filed, no precedent exists for adjudication within 69 days in Malaysia.

**(d) Justification**

The outside view base rate of ~0.05% is already extremely low. The inside view evidence reinforces this:

1. **No petition evidence**: The most critical factor is the complete absence of any news about a filed petition in the 28 days since polling. The filing window is closing or closed. This alone makes resolution as "Yes" nearly impossible.

2. **Clean election conduct**: Multiple credible sources confirm orderly proceedings. Without documented irregularities, there's no factual basis for a successful petition.

3. **Time compression**: Even if a petition were somehow filed today, Malaysian election courts have never resolved a case within 69 days. The structural/institutional timeline makes resolution before May 1 essentially impossible.

4. **Political context**: Warisan lost but has not signaled any legal challenge. BN won with what appears to be a comfortable margin (the 2025 state election had a 153-vote margin; the 2026 by-election in a simpler 2-candidate race likely produced a clearer result).

The inside view probability should be slightly lower than the outside view's 0.05%, given the absence of any petition filing evidence. However, given the irreducible uncertainty (I don't have the actual result margin or explicit confirmation no petition was filed), I maintain approximately 0.05%.

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view was 0.05%. Inside view factors:
- No petition evidence (strong, pushes down)
- Clean election conduct (strong, pushes down)
- Time constraint binding (strong, pushes down)
- Irreducible uncertainty about actual result/margin (small, pushes up slightly)

Net adjustment: slight downward from 0.05%, but given model uncertainty, I'll hold at ~0.05%.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will the Lamag by-election result (Jan 24, 2026) be annulled or re-run ordered by a court/EC before May 1, 2026, changing the winning party?

2. **Outside view base rate**: 0.05% (extremely rare: no Malaysian by-election annulled within 70 days, no Sabah annulment in recent history).

3. **Consistency check**: "0.05 out of 100 times, the Lamag result is overturned before May 1, 2026." This aligns with: no petition evidence, clean election, impossible timeline.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - No petition filing reported in 28 days post-election (factually valid per all sources)
   - Election conducted without serious incidents (Bernama/EC confirmed)
   - Malaysian election courts never adjudicate in <70 days (historical fact)
   - Filing window nearly expired (statutory 21-day rule)
   - Warisan has not signaled legal challenge (consistent across sources)

5. **Blind spot**: If BN won by a razor-thin margin and Warisan filed a petition on procedural grounds (e.g., ballot transport irregularities in remote areas) that I haven't found evidence of, and a court issued an emergency ruling. This would shift probability to ~2-3%, but no evidence supports this scenario.

6. **Status quo**: No annulment. The world changes slowly; by-election results in Malaysia are almost never overturned, especially within 70 days.

Probability: 0.05%
