Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Wikipedia – 2026 Lamag By-Election**: Confirms the basic facts (seat, date, candidates, reason for by-election). Results section is empty, suggesting it was not populated at extraction time. Reliable for background facts; no information on legal challenges. Quality: Moderate (Wikipedia, incomplete).

2. **Wikipedia – 2023 Kuala Terengganu By-Election**: Historical precedent showing Malaysian election courts can and do annul results on corruption grounds. Relevant as a reference class case. Quality: Good for historical context.

3. **The Star – Thai election article**: Entirely irrelevant to the Lamag question. Quality: N/A for this question.

4. **Astro Awani – PAS won't appeal Kemaman decision**: Confirms the Kemaman annulment precedent and PAS's decision not to appeal. Relevant as historical precedent. Quality: Good (established Malaysian news outlet).

5. **Bernama – Lamag/Kinabatangan logistics (January 20, 2026)**: Provides pre-election logistics. Notes one minor complaint received, described as orderly. No indication of serious irregularities. Quality: High (official Malaysian news agency).

6. **Malay Mail – GRS sitting out Lamag (December 21, 2025)**: Pre-election coalition strategy. No legal disputes mentioned. Quality: Good.

7. **Agent Report**: Comprehensive analysis of Malaysian election annulments since 2010. Key findings: only ONE confirmed successful annulment (Kemaman, 2023), taking ~10 months; no annulment has occurred within 97 days of a poll; EC cannot unilaterally annul; Lamag 2025 petitioner withdrew threatened challenge. Quality: Well-researched, internally consistent, though unverified claims should be treated with some skepticism.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes are applicable:

- **All Malaysian election results since 2010**: ~hundreds of elections; only 1 confirmed annulment (Kemaman 2023). Base rate: ~0.3-0.5%.
- **Malaysian by-elections specifically**: Even rarer to be annulled; by-elections are fresh contests with typically less campaign-period corruption infrastructure. Base rate: effectively ~0%.
- **Malaysian elections overturned within 97 days**: Zero confirmed cases in available history. The fastest known case (Kemaman) took ~10 months.
- **Elections in Sabah specifically**: No confirmed annulments in available data; one pending petition (Sindumin 2025).

The most suitable reference class is **Malaysian state/parliamentary elections overturned within ~3 months of polling**, for which the historical rate is effectively 0%.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The resolution window is January 24 to May 1, 2026 — approximately 97 days. Malaysian election petition proceedings require:
- Filing within 21 days of result
- Service of pleadings
- Preliminary hearings
- Full trial
- Judgment

The fastest known Malaysian annulment took ~10 months. No precedent exists for completing this process in 97 days. This is the single most constraining factor.

**(d) Justification**

The combination of factors strongly points toward "No":

1. **Procedural impossibility**: No Malaysian election has been annulled within 97 days of polling. The legal process simply cannot be completed that quickly.
2. **Extremely low base rate**: Only 1 confirmed annulment across hundreds of elections since 2010.
3. **No pre-existing disputes**: The by-election was conducted in an orderly manner (per Bernama). No serious complaints were noted.
4. **EC cannot unilaterally annul**: Only courts can do this, adding further procedural time.
5. **Local precedent**: The 2025 Lamag state election petitioner (with a much closer 153-vote margin) withdrew his challenge, suggesting the local environment is not litigious.
6. **By-election context**: By-elections triggered by death (not contested results) typically generate less post-election legal controversy.

The only scenario for "Yes" would require an extraordinary, unprecedented acceleration of Malaysian judicial proceedings combined with compelling evidence of serious electoral fraud — for which there is no indication.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate for any Malaysian election being annulled is ~0.3-0.5%. The additional constraint of the 97-day window reduces this further — to effectively near zero based on historical precedent. Even allowing for unknown unknowns, tail risks, and the possibility that I'm missing some information about post-election disputes, the probability should be in the 1-2% range. The agent report suggests 1-3%, which aligns with my analysis. I'll set it slightly below the midpoint of that range given the procedural impossibility argument is very strong.

Outside View Prediction:
1.5%
