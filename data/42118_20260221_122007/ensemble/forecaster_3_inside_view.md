Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / resolution criteria (time window)
This resolves “Yes” if, between Feb 21 and May 1, 2026, Malaysia’s EC or a court annuls the Jan 24 Lamag by-election result or orders a re-run that flips the winner.

(a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; date; facts vs opinion)
- Bernama (Jan 20, 2026) on logistics/operations: Facts on polling centers, transport, turnout target, and that the EC had received “one complaint” but described process as orderly with no serious incidents. High-quality (state news agency), contemporaneous. No details indicating major irregularities.
- Malay Mail (Dec 16, 2025; Jan 20, 2026; Jan 24, 2026) on scheduling/logistics and polling-day operations: Mostly factual reporting (dates, candidates, logistics, staffing). Reputable outlet; generally reliable for straight reporting. No mention of post-election legal challenges or credible allegations that would plausibly trigger annulment.
- The Star (Jan 6/9/10/24, 2026) on campaign atmosphere and polling proceeding smoothly: Mix of (i) facts (candidates, logistics, turnout color) and (ii) analyst opinions about electoral dynamics. Main relevant factual element: “proceeds without disruption” reporting on polling day. No concrete evidence of wrongdoing that would later support overturning.
- Wikipedia (2025 Sabah election page): Background context (hung assembly). Medium reliability; not directly informative for annulment risk in Lamag.
- AskNews: Most items are unrelated to Lamag annulment risk (DAP congress in July; indigenous land rights; weather; Melaka dissolution speculation; lottery). Low relevance; no direct evidence about petitions, EC investigations, court schedules, or irregularities in Lamag.

Net: None of the provided sources report (1) an election petition filed for Lamag, (2) an EC investigation into serious offences, or (3) any court timetable that could plausibly produce an annulment/re-run order before May 1.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution criteria)
Strong evidence
- Structural/time constraint: Malaysian election-result annulments are extremely rare and (per the outside-view research) have not historically concluded within ~3 months; the known Kemaman-style path took far longer. This is directly predictive and hard to change quickly.
- Institutional constraint: Overturning requires an authoritative annulment/re-run order (court/EC), not complaints. That process is procedurally heavy.

Moderate evidence
- Multiple mainstream reports (Bernama/Malay Mail/The Star) describing polling operations as orderly with no serious incident reporting at the time. While “no news” isn’t definitive, it moderately reduces the odds of a blow-up that leads to annulment.

Weak evidence
- “One complaint received” (Bernama) with no details. Complaints are common; without details suggesting bribery/intimidation/major procedural breach, this is weak signal.
- General Sabah political volatility (hung assembly) could marginally increase contestation incentives, but without a concrete legal trigger it’s weak.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left from today (Feb 21, 2026) until resolution (May 1, 2026): ~69 days.
- Key nuance: The by-election occurred Jan 24, but only an overturning action occurring after Feb 21 counts for resolution. That leaves an even tighter effective window for a court/EC to act.
- If the remaining time were halved (~35 days): probability would drop further because even expedited proceedings would be less likely to conclude.
- If the remaining time were doubled (~138 days): probability would rise meaningfully (still low), because election petitions/judicial processes could have time to reach judgment (e.g., moving from sub-1% toward low single digits).

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside-view base rate)
Outside view was ~1.5% for “overturned by May 1” using a ~97-day-from-poll window and historical rarity.

Inside view adjustments:
- Downward: We have no reported petition, investigation, or serious irregularity narrative in the provided sources. The best contemporaneous operational reporting (Bernama/Malay Mail/The Star) is “orderly/smooth,” and the only concrete “issue” is an unspecified single complaint. Also, because the question’s resolution window starts Feb 21, we now effectively require an authoritative action within ~69 days from today—an even tougher bar than the already-tight 97 days post-poll.
- Upward: Political stakes could be non-trivial in Sabah, and the seat may be competitive; motivated losers sometimes litigate. But without evidence of filed proceedings or a scandal, this is not enough to outweigh the time/process constraints.

Overall: The tight time remaining plus lack of any concrete challenge signal pushes me below the 1.5% outside view.

Probability calibration
- Status quo / “nothing dramatic happens”: no annulment or re-run order that flips the winner by May 1 ⇒ “No.”
- I’m aiming for the true probability of an authoritative overturning action within ~69 days, not whether there are complaints.
- A ±10% shift would be wildly inconsistent with the institutional/time constraints here; the plausible uncertainty band is more like ±0.5–1.0 percentage point.

Checklist:
1. Criteria check: Yes only if Feb 21–May 1 an EC/court annulment or re-run order flips Lamag’s winner; otherwise No.
2. Outside view base rate: 1.5%.
3. Consistency check: 1 out of 100 times, an authoritative overturning that changes the winner happens by May 1, 2026.
4. Key evidence (3–5):
   - Malaysian annulments are extremely rare; none known to conclude within ~3 months.
   - Only ~69 days remain in the resolution window from today.
   - No sources provided indicate a filed petition, EC probe, or major irregularity; polling reported “orderly.”
   - “Overturned” requires authoritative action (court/EC), not routine complaints.
5. Blind spot: A major, well-documented illegality (e.g., bribery/intimidation or fatal procedural error) emerges with an already-filed petition and unusually expedited court handling (or an EC-triggered re-run) before May 1; this would push probability up into low single digits.
6. Status quo outcome: No overturning before May 1.

Probability: 0.9%
