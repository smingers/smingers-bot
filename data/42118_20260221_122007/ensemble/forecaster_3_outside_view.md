Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (summary, quality, and date)

1) **Wikipedia: 2026 Lamag by-election** (undated/ongoing; accessed via provided link)  
- **What it says (facts):** Polling scheduled **Jan 24, 2026**; triggered by death of incumbent Bung Moktar Radin (Dec 5, 2025); main candidates BN vs Warisan; GRS and PN not contesting; no details shown for results/timeline in the extracted snapshot.  
- **What it implies (non-facts/limits):** The page is **incomplete**, especially on results and post-election developments, so it’s **not informative** about any petition/annulment.  
- **Quality:** Medium-low for timely dispute monitoring (Wikipedia often lags or is incomplete), acceptable only for basic background.

2) **Wikipedia: 2023 Kuala Terengganu by-election** (historical reference)  
- **Facts:** A court annulled the prior GE15 result (June 27, 2023) for corruption; by-election followed and PAS won again.  
- **Use here:** Establishes that **Malaysian Election Courts can annul** results for corruption/inducement.  
- **Quality:** Medium; fine for high-level chronology, but not primary evidence.

3) **The Star (Thailand election annulment risk)** (Feb 18, 2026)  
- **Facts:** About Thailand; unrelated to Sabah/Malaysia Lamag.  
- **Quality/Relevance:** Not relevant to Lamag overturn risk.

4) **Astro Awani: PAS won’t appeal Kemaman decision** (Oct 3, 2023)  
- **Facts:** Confirms a Malaysian election court annulment occurred (Kemaman GE15), and an appeal was not pursued.  
- **Quality:** High-medium as a Malaysian news outlet; relevant as precedent that annulments happen, though **not about Sabah** and **not about by-elections**.

5) **Bernama: Kinabatangan & Lamag by-election logistics** (Jan 20, 2026)  
- **Facts:** Operational details (remote polling, helicopter/boat logistics, Starlink at tally center), and EC reporting the process as orderly with “one complaint” noted pre-polling.  
- **Quality:** High for logistics/official statements (Bernama is Malaysia’s state news agency).  
- **Limits:** “Orderly” statements are not dispositive; also this is **pre-election**, not evidence of post-election litigation.

6) **Malay Mail (Dec 21, 2025): GRS likely to sit out, support BN**  
- **Facts:** Coalition coordination (GRS stands aside) suggesting a relatively **managed** contest.  
- **Quality:** Medium; relevant context but not about litigation.

7) **Agent report: list of annulled elections since 2010 + Sabah petition context** (compiled; mixed sourcing)  
- **Facts claimed:** Only one clearly confirmed annulment since 2010 in its list (Kemaman, 2023); notes typical petition/appeal timelines; mentions a Sabah petition (Sindumin) pending; mentions Lamag 2025 threatened petition later dropped.  
- **Quality:** Useful synthesis but **incomplete risk** (it’s not guaranteed exhaustive) and includes interpretive/legal-process assertions. Still, the main directional point—**annulments are rare and slow**—is consistent with known Malaysian practice.

### (b) Reference class analysis (choosing a baseline)

Possible reference classes:

1) **All Malaysian parliamentary + state elections since 2010 that were annulled**  
- **Pros:** Large sample; gives an “annulment is rare” base rate.  
- **Cons:** Not conditioned on “by-election” nor on a very short time-to-resolution window.

2) **Malaysian election petitions with outcomes within ~3 months of polling**  
- **Pros:** Directly targets the key constraint here: speed.  
- **Cons:** Harder to assemble a complete dataset; but the available precedents strongly suggest **months-to-a-year** is typical.

3) **Malaysian by-elections: frequency of court-ordered voiding/re-runs**  
- **Pros:** Most on-point (by-election-specific).  
- **Cons:** Very sparse; by-elections are few and voiding is even rarer, making inference noisy.

**Most suitable reference class for an outside view here:**  
A hybrid of (1) and (2): *“Election annulments in Malaysia are very rare, and when they do occur, they usually take far longer than ~3 months from poll to final authoritative overturn.”* That directly matches the question’s bottleneck: **an authoritative overturn by May 1, 2026**.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Election date:** Jan 24, 2026  
- **Resolution deadline:** May 1, 2026  
- **Total post-poll window:** ~97 days  
- **From ‘today’ (Feb 21, 2026) until May 1, 2026:** ~69 days remaining.

Historical pattern from the provided precedents:
- The prominent annulment examples (e.g., **Kemaman**, **Kuala Terengganu** context) show a **long lag** between election day and annulment (order-of-magnitude: many months).  
- Even if a petition exists, completing pleadings, hearings, judgment, and any effectuation in under ~3 months is atypical.

This timeframe alone pushes the outside-view probability toward **near-zero**.

### (d) Justification (outside view)

To get a “Yes,” at least one of the following must happen quickly:

- **Path 1 (annulment):** A court annuls the Lamag by-election result before May 1.  
- **Path 2 (re-run that changes winner):** Not only is a re-run ordered, but it **occurs and flips the winning party/coalition** before May 1.

Outside-view factors:

1) **Base rate of annulment is extremely low.** Even the agent-compiled list suggests only a handful of prominent annulments; relative to the huge number of elections held, this is a **tiny fraction**.

2) **The timeline is the dominant constraint.** Annulments (when they occur) generally take **far longer** than ~3 months post-poll.

3) **By-election context typically reduces litigation incentives.** By-elections are often local, lower-stakes than general elections, and (per Malay Mail/Bernama context) this one looked politically “managed” (GRS sitting out; only one pre-poll complaint mentioned). None of that proves no dispute—but it weakly pushes toward “No.”

4) **“Re-run that changes winner” is even harder.** A re-run itself requires time to schedule; and a flip in party/coalition adds another conditional step. So most of the already-small mass should be assigned to **annulment-only** rather than a completed re-run-and-flip before May 1.

Net: The outside view is that “Yes” is **possible but extraordinarily unlikely**, primarily due to **procedural duration** and **low historical frequency**.

Outside view calibration:

- The agent report informally suggests **~1–3%**, but that appears to be a broad-brush estimate without tightly conditioning on the **very short 97-day** post-election window and the additional “re-run flips winner” clause.  
- Calibrating to a more “process-aware” outside view:  
  - Probability an election result is ever annulled: very low (well under 1% in Malaysia, plausibly far under).  
  - Probability it is annulled **within ~3 months**: a fraction of that already-small number.  
  - Probability of a **re-run that flips the winner** by May 1: smaller still.

Given these compounding constraints, I anchor in the **sub-1%** range and choose a value that reflects “rare but not impossible.”

Outside View Prediction: **0.38%**
