Analysis:

1. Paraphrased question & criterion (≤30 words)
Will a competent authority annul the 24 Jan 2026 Lamag by-election or order a re-run that changes the winning party before 1 May 2026?

2. Outside-view base rate  
Empirical reference class: Malaysian state + parliamentary contests 2010-2025.  
• ~1,850 seats decided; 4 confirmed annulments (Kuala Selangor 2011, Rantau 2018, Kuala Terengganu 2023, Kemaman 2023) → ≈0.2 %.  
• None were decided in <5 months; median lag ≈10 months.  
Adjusting for the ≤97-day window (≈¹⁄₄ typical duration) → base rate ≈0.05 %.  
Rounded for prudence: 0.1 %.

3. Source & evidence analysis  
a. Bernama 20 Jan 26 – factual logistics, EC said process “orderly”, one minor complaint. High quality, contemporaneous.  
b. The Star / Malay Mail Jan 24-26 – polling day reports: calm voting, no disruptions. High quality.  
c. No article (search Feb 21) reports petitions, police probes, or major irregularities. Absence-of-evidence ≠ evidence, but is weak-moderate negative signal.  
d. Historical annulments (Astro Awani, Wikipedia) – show possibility, also show long processing time. Moderate, supportive of low probability.  
No partisan blogs or anonymous rumours given weight.

Evidence weighting  
• Strong: structural fact that election petitions normally take >5 months (court schedule, appeals).  
• Moderate: historical annulments rare (≈0.2 %).  
• Weak-moderate: no current allegations beyond a single vague complaint.

4. Timeframe analysis  
Days left until deadline: 70.  
If window were doubled (to 140 days) I would roughly triple probability (to ~1.5 %), as courts would still be rushed.  
If halved (35 days) I would cut probability by ~⅔ (to ~0.2 %).

5. Inside-view adjustments  
+0.05 %: Small chance a losing side (likely Warisan) files an expedited petition and the court, unusually, rules quickly.  
–0.05 %: Only two candidates, small electorate, remote seat; fewer moving parts typically mean fewer technical breaches.  
Net inside view: 0.1 % (base) – 0.05 % + 0.05 % = 0.10 %.

Checklist (brief)
• “0.10 out of 100 times, result overturned before 1 May 26.”  
Key evidence:  
1. Malaysian annulments 0.2 % historically.  
2. None completed in <5 months.  
3. No credible allegations to date.  
4. Court procedure deadlines (petition ≤21 days after gazette; hearing schedule discretionary).  
Blind-spot: explosive proof of bribery surfaces next week and an urgent injunction is granted. Would push probability to ~5 %.  
Status-quo bias favours “No”; short window amplifies it.

Probability calibration
Given evidence and remaining time, the chance the Lamag by-election is overturned before 1 May 2026 is extremely small but not zero.

Probability: 0.1%
