Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Bernama, 20 Jan 2026 – factual report from Malaysia’s national news agency on EC logistics; mentions only one minor complaint, “overall orderly”; high reliability, published four days before polling.  
2. The Star, 24 Jan 2026 – election-day dispatch; polling proceeded “without disruption”; no allegations; mainstream national daily, reliable.  
3. Malay Mail, 24 Jan 2026 – similar on-the-ground report; confirms clean process; reliable English-language paper.  
4. Wikipedia “2025 Sabah state election” – background on political actors; community-edited but well-sourced; moderate reliability; last updated Jan 2026.  
5. AskNews bundle (Feb 19-21 2026) – stories on DAP congress, rainfall warnings, land-rights NGOs, etc.; none mention Lamag petitions; all within last three days; tangential, therefore low evidentiary weight for this forecast.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Historical pattern: 1 court-annulled seat out of ~1,700 Malaysian contests since 2010 (≈0.06%).  
• Election-court cases that succeeded (Kemaman, Kuala Terengganu) took 7–11 months from poll to final judgment – never <4 months.  

Moderate evidence  
• No media, party, or EC statement (as of 21 Feb 2026) indicating that Warisan (loser by 2,136 votes) or any voter has filed an election petition; deadline roughly mid-Feb if results gazetted by 31 Jan.  
• EC acknowledged only one minor complaint and “no serious incidents”.  

Weak evidence  
• Small, remote constituency might face logistical irregularities (helicopter/boat transport, early closures) – merely theoretical.  
• Heightened post-Kemaman vigilance could prompt more petitions – speculative.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until question closes: 70.  
If the window were halved (35 days): probability would drop further (~0.3 %) as even an existing petition could not conceivably finish.  
If doubled (140 days): probability would rise slightly (~1 %) but still be limited by typical 7-month court pace.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate: 0.8 %.  
Adjust down for unprecedented 70-day window (-0.4 pp).  
Adjust down for absence of any public petition signal five weeks after poll (-0.2 pp).  
Adjust up slightly for national mood of challenging corrupt practices (+0.1 pp).  
Net inside-view estimate ≈ 0.3 %.  
Because news of a filed petition could still surface (low-visibility filings are possible), I round up modestly.

Probability calibration
“About 0.7 out of 100 times, the Lamag by-election would be annulled by 1 May 2026.”

Checklist:
1. Will Lamag by-election, held 24 Jan 2026, be legally overturned before 1 May 2026?  
2. Outside view base rate: 0.8 %.  
3. Consistency: “0.7/100 times an authoritative annulment occurs within 97 days.” Sounds plausible.  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
   – Only one annulment of ~1,700 seats since 2010.  
   – Court cases historically exceed 4 months to conclude.  
   – No petition publicly reported by 21 Feb 2026.  
   – EC, media: polling orderly, single minor complaint.  
5. Blind-spot: Secret petition filed 14 Feb and court issues lightning judgment using summary evidence. Would raise probability to ~5 %.  
6. Status quo (no overturn) aligned with slow-change norm and tight legal timetable.

Probability: 0.7%
