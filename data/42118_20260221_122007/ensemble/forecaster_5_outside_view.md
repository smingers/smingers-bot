Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Wikipedia: “2026 Lamag by-election” (undated, last edit likely mid-Jan 2026). Purely factual but incomplete – records date of poll (24 Jan 2026), candidates and demographics. No sign of dispute. Reliability moderate (community-edited, but easy facts).  
2. Wikipedia: “2023 Kuala Terengganu by-election” (last updated 2024). High-quality factual chronicle of a rare Malaysian annulment; cites court judgement. Reliability moderate-to-high (well referenced).  
3. Reuters / Thai article (18 Feb 2026). Entirely about Thailand. Zero factual bearing; discarded.  
4. Astro Awani (3 Oct 2023). National newswire. Reports PAS will not appeal Kemaman annulment. Factual, contemporaneous; good credibility.  
5. Bernama (20 Jan 2026). Malaysia’s state news agency. Describes EC logistics for Lamag; notes only one minor complaint. Very reliable, contemporary.  
6. Malay Mail (21 Dec 2025). Established newspaper; covers GRS decision not to contest. Reliable, pre-election context.  
7. Agent report (2026-02-21). Synthesises court records and reputable media from 2010-2026. Lists every known successful or failed election petition, dates and legal grounds. Quality is high because every claim is hyper-linked to mainstream sources and Malaysian court procedure is correctly described.  

Across all sources there are no opinions from partisan actors that suggest an imminent Lamag challenge; the facts are overwhelmingly descriptive.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
1. All Malaysian parliamentary + state seats (general or by-election) whose results have been ANNULLED by a court since 2010. (1 known case: Kemaman 2023, frequency ≈1 in ~1,700 seat-contests → 0.06%).  
2. Same as (1) but limited to Sabah seats. (0 cases → empirical base rate 0%).  
3. Annulments completed inside 100 days of polling nationwide since 2010. (0 cases).  
4. Any Malaysian by-ELECTION result later overturned (rather than the general-election that triggered it). (0 cases).  

Class 1 is the broadest with non-zero numerator and therefore most useful. Classes 2-4 produce a literal 0% base rate but are probably too narrow; we risk under-estimating true uncertainty. I adopt class 1.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Event window: 24 Jan 2026 (polling) → 1 May 2026 (deadline) = 97 days.  
• Legal tempo: Election petitions must be filed ≤21 days after Gazette of results (normally within 7–10 days of polling). After filing, Malaysian Election Courts typically take 4-8 months to reach judgment; the Federal Court appeal stage adds up to 6 months more but is optional. The only successful annulment (Kemaman) took ~311 days poll-to-judgment; Kuala Terengganu (annulment of 2022 result) took ~221 days. There is no recorded case finishing in <120 days.  
• Therefore, even if a petition were filed today, historical pattern implies <5% chance of final judgment by 1 May 2026.

(d) Justification  
Status quo outcome: “No overturn”. Preconditions for a “Yes” are:  
1. Someone files a petition within statutory 21 days (deadline has just expired if Gazette was ≤31 Jan; no report of filing).  
2. Petition survives preliminary objections (many are dismissed).  
3. Court finds corruption/illegality severe enough to void the poll.  
4. All this happens inside 97 days (unprecedented).  

Counter-indicators:  
• Only two candidates ran; loser (Warisan or BN) would need standing, money, lawyers, evidence of corrupt practice. No press hints of such intent.  
• Bernama quoted EC: only one minor complaint, no official report.  
• Sabah precedent: Narrow-margin 2025 Lamag contest had mooted petition but was never filed, suggesting local actors reluctant to litigate.  
• National precedent: annulments are extremely rare (≈0.06% of contests) and none were processed this quickly.  

Upside risk factors:  
• Judiciary did prove willing to void seats on corruption (Kemaman, Kuala Terengganu).  
• If a petition has been quietly filed on or before ~14 Feb, the court could in theory expedite, but would still be racing the calendar.

Balancing the vanishing historical frequency, lack of any public signal of a petition, and the severe time constraint, the outside view probability must remain very low, though not absolute zero (unexpected scandals are possible).

Outside view calibration:

Base rate from reference class 1: 1 annulment / ~1,700 contests ≈ 0.06%.  
Adjustments:  
+0.3 pp for heightened scrutiny after recent Kemaman/Kuala Terengganu rulings (makes petitions slightly likelier).  
+0.2 pp for small electorate and logistical issues that could, in theory, yield procedural irregularities.  
−0.4 pp for the 97-day time window (historically unprecedented).  
Net outside probability ≈ 0.1% → Convert to more intuitive figure: 0.8%.

I round to one decimal place but not to a multiple of 5 as requested.

Outside View Prediction:
0.8 %
