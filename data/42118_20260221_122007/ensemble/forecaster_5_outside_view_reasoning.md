**Evaluating election annulment likelihood**

I'm considering the timeframe—only 97 days until the election. Historically, an annulment might take around six months through the Federal Court, which makes it improbable to happen in this scenario. So, I estimate the probability of an annulment at around 2%. Also, the by-election result isn't known yet, and regardless of which side it favors, it's still unlikely. Now, I need to craft a clear answer.
