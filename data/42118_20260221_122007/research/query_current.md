Analysis:
The Lamag by-election in Sabah was held less than a month ago (24 Jan 2026). To assess whether the result could be overturned before 1 May 2026, the most relevant information now is:
• Any petition filed in the Election Court within the statutory window (typically 14–21 days after the result is gazetted).  
• Statements from the losing candidates/parties about challenging the outcome.  
• Announcements by Malaysia’s Election Commission (SPR) or court listings indicating a case regarding the Lamag seat.  
Because the overturn would require formal legal or administrative action, coverage is likely in Malaysian political news, Sabah local outlets, and official press releases. Therefore I will look for reports on petitions, court hearings, or EC announcements about the Lamag by-election.
