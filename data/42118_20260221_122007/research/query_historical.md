Analysis:
To assess the odds that the Lamag by-election result might be overturned, the most useful historical context is:
• How frequently Malaysian courts or the Election Commission have annulled state or parliamentary by-elections in the past, with special attention to Sabah cases.  
• Typical grounds for annulment (e.g., bribery, corruption, procedural irregularities) and how quickly decisions were handed down after polling day.  
• Any precedent-setting rulings from the last two election cycles (e.g., Kuala Terengganu 2023, Kimanis 2020, previous Sabah state seats).  
• Early coverage of the Lamag race itself that might hint at potential petitions or allegations.

Therefore, searches should locate:
1) Historical lists of Malaysian election petitions and outcomes.  
2) News reports on Lamag and recent Sabah electoral disputes.  
3) A synthesized overview of court-ordered re-runs in Malaysia since 2010, emphasizing timing between polling and annulment.
