In Terengganu, 51 residents from 14 families were displaced from their ancestral forest area in Long Unu Bukit Bak in January to make way for a religious education institution, despite the land being their traditional territory before relocation to Sungai Burung. In Pahang, 21 indigenous people were detained on February 9 after entering land claimed by a development company; community representatives argue they acted without 'free, prior, and informed consent' to defend their ancestral land. In Selangor, the Pulau Kali indigenous craft center raised concerns on February 11 about the approval of the West Port expansion project without community consent, with RimbaWatch\u2019s preliminary findings indicating a proposed oil terminal near Kampung Sungai Kular could cause severe pollution and habitat destruction. On February 12, roadblocks set up by communities in Kelantan\u2019s Chenderoh region to protest a 2,000-hectare resort and agricultural development project were dismantled by police and forestry officials, despite a memorandum submitted in August 2024 opposing the plan due to threats to customary land and ecology. The organizations stress that Anwar\u2019s 2023 Pakatan Harapan election pledge to protect indigenous land rights has not been upheld, despite prior national surveys and court rulings. They call on the government to honor its obligations under the 2007 UN Declaration on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples and implement recommendations from SUHAKAM\u2019s national survey on indigenous land rights.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 21, 2026 05:57 AM\nSource:[\u661f\u6d32\u65e5\u62a5](https://www.sinchew.com.my/news/20260221/nation/7285547)\n\n**DAP's next move under scrutiny**\nThe Democratic Action Party (DAP) is under political scrutiny as its upcoming special congress on July 12, 2026, is seen as a pivotal moment for its future alignment within Pakatan Harapan. While PKR\u2019s R. Yuneswaran and Pasir Gudang MP Hassan Abdul Karim emphasize unity and mutual respect, stressing that DAP\u2019s 40 parliamentary seats are critical to Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim\u2019s administration\u2014such a withdrawal would mathematically collapse the government\u2014Amanah\u2019s Muhammad Faiz Fadzil and Khalid Samad urge DAP to remain in government to preserve coalition strength and policy influence. Universiti Malaya analyst Professor Datuk Dr Awang Azman Awang Pawi warns that if DAP leaders resign from government, the administration\u2019s majority could be jeopardized, risking political instability. Ilham Centre CEO Hisommudin Bakar interprets the congress as a response to voter dissatisfaction revealed in the recent Sabah election, particularly among Chinese urban voters, signaling a need to prevent a broader rejection in Peninsular Malaysia. He cautions that failing to adopt more responsive policies may lead to stronger voter backlash in the 16th General Election (GE16). DAP secretary-general Anthony Loke confirmed the congress would allow delegates to decide whether leaders should relinquish all government posts, though the party will continue supporting Anwar\u2019s government until the end of the current term. The congress aims to secure a mandate from delegates on DAP\u2019s strategic direction ahead of GE16.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2026 11:25 PM\nSource:[The Star ](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2026/02/21/daps-next-move-under-scrutiny)\n\n**Melaka assembly may dissolve in April, state poll expected in June**\nThe Melaka state legislative assembly may be dissolved during its April sitting, potentially leading to a state election in early June, according to multiple state political party leaders. Melaka PKR strategy director Mohd Radzmin Roslan confirmed the party is preparing for a possible three-cornered contest, particularly if Barisan Nasional does not cooperate with Pakatan Harapan, and is coordinating with DAP and Amanah. The state poll could occur before the PKR national congress scheduled for June 25\u201328 in Melaka. Melaka DAP\u2019s Low Chee Leong stated that while speculation about an April dissolution exists, it remains unconfirmed and awaits the next assembly sitting. Melaka Gerakan chief Datuk Seri Michael Gan Peng Lam confirmed growing talk of dissolution in mid-April to enable a June election, noting preparations are underway with Perikatan Nasional partners. He emphasized that the recent resignation of Datuk Mas Ermieyati Samsudin and 39 committee members from Masjid Tanah Bersatu is an internal party matter and will not affect state-level election preparations. Political observer Michael Ching suggested the timing might be strategic, possibly aligning with a Johor state election and a concurrent parliamentary dissolution. He noted Barisan Nasional is expected to contest under its own banner, citing strong grassroots support through programs like Wakil Rakyat Untuk Rakyat (WRUR) and state fiscal development. Umno president Datuk Seri Dr Ahmad Zahid Hamidi previously indicated the state poll could occur within the next two to ten months, highlighting challenges for Melaka Umno leaders due to limited preparation time. In the 2021 Melaka election, Barisan Nasional won 21 of 28 contested seats. The current state legislative assembly\u2019s five-year term ends in December 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2026 10:18 AM\nSource:[The Star ](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2026/02/20/melaka-assembly-may-dissolve-in-april-state-poll-expected-in-june)\n\n**SUPER LOTO RESULTS LIVE: 19 February 2026 MP\u0130 Super Loto Results Click for Quick Check Screen!**\nThe Super Loto lottery results for February 19, 2026, were announced by Milli Piyango (MP\u0130), drawing significant public interest from lottery enthusiasts.

He questioned the purpose of the congress, arguing that even if DAP leaders resign from government positions following the vote, the party would still remain in coalition with the government. According to Ramasamy, the government is aware that DAP will not withdraw support, rendering the congress ineffective as a tool for pressuring reforms. The congress, announced by DAP secretary-general Loke Siew Fook, is framed as an internal 'referendum' following the party's poor performance in the Sabah polls. Delegates will vote on whether party leaders should resign from ministerial, deputy ministerial, state executive, local council, and GLC roles. However, Loke emphasized that regardless of the outcome, DAP MPs will continue supporting the government until the next general election and will not participate in any 'backdoor government' attempts.

According to a report in Malay Mail, citing secretary-general Anthony Loke, over 4,000 central delegates will participate in what Loke described as an internal 'referendum'. This marks the first time such a major political decision will be referred to the party\u2019s highest decision-making body rather than being decided solely by the Central Executive Committee. Loke emphasized that DAP\u2019s 40 Members of Parliament will continue supporting Anwar\u2019s government until the next general election and will not participate in any attempt to form a 'backdoor government'. He stated that collective responsibility is essential and warned against 'governing while opposing from within'. The decision follows DAP\u2019s failure to win any of the eight seats it contested in the November 2025 Sabah state election, losing all the constituencies it previously held in the state assembly.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2026 01:55 AM\nSource:[Malay Mail](https://www.malaymail.com/news/malaysia/2026/02/20/dap-to-hold-july-12-congress-on-whether-its-leaders-should-quit-their-government-glc-posts/209703)\n\n**DAP to decide on July 12 if its leaders should resign from govt posts, says Loke**\nThe Democratic Action Party (DAP) will hold a special congress on July 12, 2026, to decide whether its leaders should resign from all government posts\u2014including ministerial, deputy ministerial, state executive councillor, local council, and government-linked company roles\u2014while continuing to support the unity government in Parliament, according to DAP secretary-general Anthony Loke. More than 4,000 central delegates are expected to vote, marking the first time such a major political decision is referred to the party\u2019s highest decision-making body rather than being determined solely by the Central Executive Committee (CEC). The move follows a significant setback in the November 2025 Sabah state election, prompting a six-month reform period and a reassessment of DAP\u2019s role in the ruling coalition. Loke described the congress as an internal 'referendum', emphasizing that even if delegates vote for resignation, DAP\u2019s 40 MPs will continue to support Prime Minister Datuk Seri Anwar Ibrahim\u2019s unity government until the next general election. DAP currently holds the most government positions among coalition parties: five ministerial posts, seven deputy ministerial roles, four senatorships, one chief ministership, one state ministership, 21 state executive councillor positions, and hundreds of local and village appointments. Originally scheduled for September, the congress was moved forward to July 12. Loke stressed that the party cannot 'have it both ways'\u2014if it stays in government, it must act as a unified body and speak with one voice. He clarified that the decision is not a threat to the Prime Minister, nor does it signal intent to form a 'backdoor government'. The congress will also allow open debate on broader strategic questions, including whether to remain in Pakatan Harapan, contest independently, or revert to using the party\u2019s Rocket symbol. Once a decision is made, all members must abide by it without ambiguity, Loke stated. The decision will shape DAP\u2019s direction for the next 12 to 18 months.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 09:13 PM\nSource:[thestar.com.my](https://www.thestar.com.my/news/nation/2026/02/19/dap-to-decide-on-july-12-if-its-leaders-should-resign-from-govt-posts-says-loke)\n\n**DAP congress in July to review role in government**\nThe Democratic Action Party (DAP) will hold a special congress on July 12, 2026, in Petaling Jaya to determine whether its leaders should resign from their roles in the unity government while continuing to support it in Parliament. According to DAP secretary-general Loke Siew Fook, 4,000 delegates will vote on whether party leaders should step down as ministers, deputy ministers, state executive councillors, local councillors, and GLC representatives. This marks the first time the party has entrusted such a major political decision to a congress rather than the central executive committee (CEC), making it an internal 'referendum'. Loke emphasized that regardless of the outcome, DAP MPs will continue supporting the government until the next general election and will not withdraw support or participate in forming a 'backdoor government'. He clarified that the move is not a threat to Prime Minister Anwar Ibrahim but a review of DAP\u2019s role in government, noting that some leaders are still adjusting to the pressures of being in power after years in opposition. The congress is described as the highest decision-making body, with Loke stating the process aims to be more institutionalized and democratic. This decision follows DAP and Pakatan Harapan\u2019s defeat in the Sabah state election on December 2, 2025, where DAP lost all eight contested seats. Loke stated the party would work closely with Anwar to accelerate reforms over the next six months.

Political analysts, including Associate Prof Dr Lee Kuok Tiung from Universiti Malaysia Sabah and senior lecturer Tony Paridi Bagang from Sabah UiTM, note Barisan's advantage due to emotional sympathy for Bung Moktar, traditional patronage, and strong personal appeal of Naim Kurniawan. Prof Lee warned that opposition campaigning against Bung Moktar could backfire, while stressing the need for Sabah-based leaders to lead the campaign.
