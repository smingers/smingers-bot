Include sources.\n# Malaysian State and Parliamentary Elections Annulled by Courts Since 2010: Comprehensive Analysis\n\n## Overview and Legal Framework\n\nUnder Malaysian law, election results are challenged via petitions to the Election Court (a High Court sitting in that capacity) under the Election Offences Act 1954. Grounds for annulment include corrupt practices (Section 32(c)), illegal practices, and non-compliance with election laws affecting the result (Section 32(b)). The Election Commission itself does not annul completed results \u2014 this is exclusively a judicial function. Appeals from the Election Court go to the Federal Court within 14 days, and the Federal Court must decide within six months. If no appeal is filed within 14 days, the Election Court's decision is final.\n\n---\n\n## Confirmed Cases of Annulled Malaysian Elections Since 2010\n\n### 1. Kemaman Parliamentary Seat (GE15, Terengganu) \u2014 CONFIRMED ANNULMENT\n\n| Field | Detail |\n|-------|--------|\n| **Date of Poll** | November 19, 2022 (GE15) |\n| **Date of Annulment** | September 26, 2023 |\n| **Reason** | Bribery/corrupt practice under Section 32(c), Election Offences Act 1954. The Election Court (Judge Datuk Anselm Charles Fernandis) found that state government programmes distributing i-Belia and i-Siswa aid funds to voters during the GE15 campaign period constituted inducement of voters and corruption to garner votes for PAS candidate Che Alias Hamid. Although the Terengganu state government was not in caretaker mode (Terengganu held its state election separately), the court found the timing of these programmes \u2014 so close to the federal election \u2014 was improper. |\n| **Winning Candidate Unseated** | Che Alias Hamid (PAS/PN), who had won with 65,714 votes and a 27,179-vote majority |\n| **Petitioner** | Wan Mohamad Hisham Wan Abdul Hamid (representing Terengganu UMNO/BN) |\n| **Costs Ordered** | RM 30,000 payable by Che Alias to petitioner |\n| **Appeal** | PAS/Che Alias decided NOT to appeal (announced October 3, 2023) |\n| **Consequence** | By-election held December 2, 2023; PN's Ahmad Samsuri Mokhtar won with a 37,220-vote majority |\n| **In Sabah?** | **No** (Terengganu, Peninsular Malaysia) |\n| **Sources** | Malay Mail, September 26, 2023; Wikipedia, 2023 Kemaman by-election; Sinar Daily, February 12, 2023 |\n\n**Note on procedural complexity:** There were actually *two* petitions filed against the Kemaman result. The first petition (heard by Judge Mohamad Abazafree) was dismissed on February 12, 2023 on a preliminary objection \u2014 the petition was found defective because it lacked specific details about alleged bribery recipients. However, a *second* petition (heard by Judge Anselm Charles Fernandis) succeeded on September 26, 2023, resulting in annulment. This illustrates that multiple petitions can be filed against the same result, and procedural technicalities can determine outcomes at first instance.\n\n---\n\n## Cases Where Petitions Were Filed But Dismissed (Not Annulled) Since 2010\n\n| Seat | Date of Poll | Date of Dismissal | Outcome | Reason | In Sabah? | Source |\n|------|-------------|-------------------|---------|--------|-----------|--------|\n| Jasin (P, Melaka) | May 9, 2018 (GE14) | June 12, 2019 | Dismissed | Non-compliance not proven to have affected result (Section 32(b)) | No | Malay Mail |\n| Segamat (P, Johor) | Nov 19, 2022 (GE15) | ~April 2023 | Dismissed (appeal filed) | Unknown | No | NST/IIUM LJ |\n| Gombak Setia (S, Selangor) | August 12, 2023 | December 11, 2023 | Dismissed | Bribery allegations not proven; costs of RM 25,000 ordered against petitioner | No | Malay Mail, Dec 11, 2023 |\n\n---\n\n## Sabah-Specific Election Petition Activity\n\n### Sindumin State Constituency (17th Sabah State Election, 2025)\n- **Date of Poll:** November 29, 2025\n- **Petition Filed:** December 26, 2025\n- **Status:** Pending adjudication\n- **Alleged Reason:** Non-compliance with election laws; alleged crumpling/tampering of ballot papers by an EC officer during counting at SK Melalia (video evidence alleged)\n- **Winning Candidate:** Warisan's Yusri Pungut (margin: 362 votes)\n- **In Sabah?** YES\n- **Source:** Malay Mail / Borneo Post, December 27, 2025\n\n### Lamag State Constituency \u2014 2025 State Election Context (Directly Relevant to Forecasting Question)\n- **Date of Poll (2025 State Election):** November 29, 2025\n- **Winner:** Datuk Seri Bung Moktar Radin (BN/UMNO), by a margin of **153 votes** over independent candidate Mohd Ismail Ayob (\"Miha\")\n- **Petition Threatened:** On November 30, 2025, Mohd Ismail stated he would file an election petition, citing: (1) denial of entry to the counting centre at SMK Bukit Garam II; (2) procedural issues at polling centres; (3) denial of a recount despite the margin being under the 4% threshold (actual margin was ~1.8%)\n- **Subsequent Development:** Per The Star (December 26, 2025), Mohd Ismail ultimately **decided NOT to pursue the petition** \u2014 \"Despite losing by a narrow 153-vote margin and initially indicating his intention to file an election petition, Ismail has since decided not to pursue the matter further.\"\n- **Consequence:** Bung Moktar Radin died on December 5, 2025, vacating the Lamag seat and triggering the January 24, 2026 by-election.\n- **In Sabah?** YES\n- **Source:** The Star, November 30, 2025; The Star, December 26, 2025\n\n---\n\n## Summary Table: All Confirmed/Relevant Cases Since 2010\n\n| Seat | Type | Date of Poll | Date of Annulment | Outcome | Reason | In Sabah? | Source |\n|------|------|-------------|-------------------|---------|--------|-----------|--------|\n| Kemaman | Parliamentary | Nov 19, 2022 | **Sep 26, 2023** | **ANNULLED** | Bribery/corrupt practice (s.32(c)) \u2014 state govt aid distribution during campaign | No (Terengganu) | Malay Mail; Wikipedia |\n| Jasin | Parliamentary | May 9, 2018 | Jun 12, 2019 | Dismissed | Non-compliance not proven | No (Melaka) | Malay Mail |\n| Segamat | Parliamentary | Nov 19, 2022 | ~Apr 2023 | Dismissed | Unknown | No (Johor) | NST |\n| Gombak Setia | State | Aug 12, 2023 | Dec 11, 2023 | Dismissed | Bribery not proven | No (Selangor) | Malay Mail |\n| Sindumin | State | Nov 29, 2025 | Pending | Petition filed | Alleged ballot tampering | **YES** | Borneo Post |\n| Lamag (2025) | State | Nov 29, 2025 | N/A | No petition filed | Threatened but withdrawn | **YES** | The Star |\n\n*(P) = Parliamentary; (S) = State*\n\n---\n\n## Implications for the Lamag By-Election (January 24, 2026) Forecasting Question\n\n**Question:** Will the official result of the Lamag by-election (January 24, 2026) be overturned before May 1, 2026?\n\nSeveral factors bear on this assessment:\n\n1. **Extreme rarity of successful annulments:** Across the entire dataset since 2010, only **one confirmed successful annulment** has been identified \u2014 Kemaman (2023). That case involved a very large-margin win (27,179 votes) being overturned on bribery grounds, and took approximately **10 months** from poll to annulment. The base rate of successful annulments is extremely low.\n\n2. **Timeline is prohibitively tight:** The window from January 24, 2026 to May 1, 2026 is only **97 days**. Even in the Kemaman case \u2014 the only confirmed annulment \u2014 the process took ~10 months. Malaysian election petition proceedings involve filing (within 21 days of result), service of pleadings, preliminary hearings, full trial, and judgment. No Malaysian election petition since 2010 has been resolved within 97 days of the poll.\n\n3. **EC cannot unilaterally annul:** The Election Commission has no standard mechanism to annul a completed, gazetted election result. Annulment is exclusively a judicial function. The EC's role post-annulment is to receive the court's certification and call a by-election.\n\n4. **Lamag 2025 petition precedent:** The most directly analogous case \u2014 the 2025 Lamag state election (153-vote margin, procedural complaints) \u2014 resulted in the threatened petitioner (Miha) **deciding not to file**. This suggests the local political environment does not strongly favor aggressive petitioning in Lamag.\n\n5. **By-election context:** The January 24, 2026 Lamag by-election is triggered by the death of the incumbent (Bung Moktar Radin), not by any contested result. The by-election itself will be a fresh contest. For its result to be overturned before May 1, 2026, a petition would need to be filed and adjudicated within ~97 days \u2014 an unprecedented timeline in Malaysian electoral history.\n\n6. **Sabah electoral environment:** While Sabah has an active petitioning environment (Sindumin 2025 petition pending), no Sabah election petition since 2010 has been confirmed as resulting in annulment within the available data.\n\n**Conclusion:** The probability of the Lamag by-election result being overturned before May 1, 2026 is very low, driven primarily by: (a) the extreme rarity of successful annulments in Malaysian electoral history; (b) the impossibility of completing petition proceedings within the 97-day window based on all historical precedents; and (c) the absence of any pre-existing legal challenge or unusual circumstances specific to Lamag that would accelerate proceedings. A reasonable probability estimate would be in the range of **1\u20133%**.</Agent_report>\n"
