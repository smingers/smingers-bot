Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**AskNews Articles:**

1. **Medium.com (Feb 17, 2026)** - Ukraine Update blog post. Factual claim: Russia has used chemical weapons since November 2022, including chloropicrin, and OPCW confirmed violations in 2025. This is opinion/advocacy writing from an unidentified author. The factual claims about OPCW confirmation are consistent with other sources, but the framing is partisan. Moderate quality for factual claims, low quality for interpretation. **Critically: chloropicrin is Schedule 3, not Schedule 1.**

2. **Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (Feb 20, 2026)** - Reputable arms control publication. Reports on Navalny's alleged poisoning with epibatidine (a Schedule 1 analogue). This involves Russia's use of chemical weapons against a political dissident, not in Ukraine's territory. Not directly relevant to resolution criteria (must be in pre-2014 Ukraine territory). High source quality, low relevance.

3. **RTS.ch (Feb 21, 2026)** - Swiss public broadcaster. Reports on Sabrina Dallafior's OPCW appointment. Notes "ongoing allegations of chemical weapon use by state actors, including Georgia and Iran" and mentions Ukraine context. Expert opinion from Natasha Hall (CSIS) that "the taboo against chemical weapons has weakened." Credible source, moderate relevance. Importantly, the article notes OPCW confirmed destruction of all *declared* stockpiles in 2023 — suggesting Schedule 1 agents are harder to obtain/use.

4. **Oneindia (Feb 21, 2026)** - Boris Johnson interview. References Syria's chemical weapons use as past Western failure. No direct evidence of current Ukraine chemical weapons use. Low relevance.

5. **Вечерняя Москва (Dec 12, 2025)** - Russian state-adjacent media. Military "expert" Vasily Dandykin claims Ukraine may use white phosphorus, chloropicrin, lewisite, sarin, soman. This is Russian propaganda/disinformation framing. Very low credibility for factual claims. The expert is not independently verifiable as credible.

6. **Ukrinform/Korrespondent (Nov 25, 2025)** - Ukrainian state media. Reports Ukraine elected to OPCW Executive Council. Claims Russia used toxic agents 11,000 times, affecting 3,000 Ukrainian military. These figures are Ukrainian government claims, not independently verified. The OPCW election outcome is factual. Moderate quality.

7. **EU Council (Oct 13, 2025)** - Official EU source. Confirms EU extended chemical weapons sanctions, including against 3 Russian organizations added May 20, 2025 for "development and use of chemical weapons by Russian forces in Ukraine." This is strong institutional evidence of official EU attribution of chemical weapons use to Russia. However, the specific agents involved are not specified — likely CS/chloropicrin (not Schedule 1).

8. **RT (Oct 10, 2025)** - Russian state media. Russia's envoy presents counter-accusations against Ukraine at OPCW. Claims Ukraine used chloroacetophenone and chloropicrin. This is Russian counter-narrative. Low credibility for factual claims.

9. **Tunisie Numerique (Oct 14, 2025)** - Describes OPCW confirmed CS in grenades/soil samples near front lines. No attribution made. Consistent with prior OPCW findings. Moderate quality.

**Key background sources (from outside view):**
- OPCW TAV reports (Nov 2024, Feb 2025): Confirmed CS agent in samples. CS is NOT Schedule 1.
- U.S. State Department (May 2024): Formal determination of Russia using chloropicrin. Chloropicrin is NOT Schedule 1.
- Dutch/German intelligence (July 2025): Confirmed chloropicrin use. NOT Schedule 1.
- EU sanctions (May 2025): Added Russian entities for chemical weapons use in Ukraine. Agents not specified as Schedule 1.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence (large weight):**
- **3+ years of conflict with zero confirmed Schedule 1 use**: The entire documented history of chemical incidents in Ukraine involves CS (Schedule 2/riot control) and chloropicrin (Schedule 3). Zero Schedule 1 agents confirmed by any credible source. This is a strong historical pattern with high predictive power. **Strongly favors No.**
- **EU sanctions (Oct 2025) and OPCW findings**: Confirm ongoing chemical weapons use, but all confirmed agents are non-Schedule-1. The resolution criteria specifically requires Schedule 1. **Strongly favors No** for resolution, even though chemical weapons use is ongoing.
- **NATO deterrence specifically against Schedule 1 use**: NATO has repeatedly warned of "severe consequences" for chemical weapons use. Russia has calibrated its use to stay below the threshold that triggers maximum Western response (using deniable, lower-tier agents). **Moderately favors No.**

**Moderate evidence:**
- **CSIS expert (Natasha Hall) via RTS.ch**: "The taboo against chemical weapons has weakened, with actors testing international tolerance." This suggests gradual escalation risk. **Moderately favors Yes** (small upward adjustment).
- **EU Council sanctions (May 2025)**: Three Russian organizations sanctioned for developing AND using chemical weapons in Ukraine. This institutional attribution is significant, but the agents remain non-Schedule-1. **Neutral to slightly favoring Yes** (shows escalating Western response, which could indicate escalating Russian use).
- **Peace negotiations context**: Geneva talks (Feb 17, 2026) and ceasefire discussions. Counterintuitively, negotiations could either reduce escalation risk (Russia wants deal) or increase it (Russia wants leverage). **Ambiguous.**

**Weak evidence:**
- **Russian propaganda claims (Dandykin, Вечерняя Москва)**: Ukraine may use sarin/soman. Not credible. Ignore.
- **Navalny epibatidine poisoning**: Schedule 1 use by Russia, but outside Ukraine territory and pre-resolution window. Demonstrates Russia's willingness to use Schedule 1 agents, but in very different context. **Weak upward adjustment.**
- **Boris Johnson's reference to Syria chemical weapons**: Historical analogy, not direct evidence. Weak.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The resolution window is **February 22 to May 1, 2026** — approximately **68 days** (about 2.3 months).

**If halved (~34 days):** Probability would drop to approximately 2-3%. The short window makes a dramatic escalation to Schedule 1 agents even less likely.

**If doubled (~136 days):** Probability would rise to approximately 7-10%. More time increases the chance of an escalatory event, but the fundamental constraint (Russia's strategic calculus against Schedule 1 use) remains.

The current status quo is: ongoing use of CS and chloropicrin (non-Schedule-1), with no indication of imminent escalation to nerve agents or other Schedule 1 chemicals. The conflict is in a phase of ceasefire negotiations, which historically reduces (not increases) the likelihood of dramatic escalation.

**(d) Justification**

**Critical factor: Schedule 1 restriction in fine print**

The most important analytical point is that the resolution criteria specifically requires a "chemical listed at OPCW's Annex on Chemicals Schedule 1." This is dramatically more restrictive than the question title implies. Schedule 1 includes:
- Nerve agents: sarin, tabun, soman, VX, novichok agents
- Mustard gas, lewisite, phosgene oxime
- Other highly toxic agents

**All confirmed chemical weapons use in Ukraine involves non-Schedule-1 agents:**
- CS (riot control agent): Not Schedule 1
- Chloropicrin: Schedule 3, not Schedule 1
- CN (tear gas): Not Schedule 1

Despite 3+ years of conflict and thousands of documented incidents, Russia has not used Schedule 1 agents in Ukraine. This is the dominant factor.

**Why Russia avoids Schedule 1:**
1. Deniability: CS and chloropicrin are harder to attribute definitively
2. Deterrence: NATO has drawn implicit red lines around nerve agent use
3. Tactical sufficiency: Riot control agents effectively dislodge troops from trenches
4. International consequences: Schedule 1 use would trigger maximum Western response

**Escalation scenarios (upward pressure):**
- Military desperation (Russia losing ground)
- Ceasefire negotiations collapsing, Russia needing decisive action
- Accidental escalation or rogue unit action
- Russia deciding deterrence has already failed

**Current context (Feb 22, 2026):**
- Ceasefire/peace talks ongoing (Geneva, Feb 17)
- Russia still making incremental gains in eastern Ukraine
- No intelligence reports of imminent Schedule 1 use
- NATO military aid continuing (UK £200M+ for air defense)

The status quo strongly favors continued non-Schedule-1 chemical use, which would NOT resolve this question as Yes.

**Final calibration:**

Outside view: 4.5% (based on 0/3+ years of Schedule 1 use in this conflict)

Inside view adjustments:
- Confirmed ongoing chemical weapons use (non-Schedule-1): neutral (doesn't change Schedule 1 probability much)
- Peace talks reducing escalation pressure: slight downward (-0.5%)
- Weakening chemical weapons taboo (CSIS expert): slight upward (+0.5%)
- Short 68-day window: slight downward (already factored in outside view)
- No current intelligence suggesting imminent Schedule 1 use: slight downward (-0.5%)

**Inside view: ~4%**

---

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view of 4.5% is well-anchored in the historical record (zero Schedule 1 use in 3+ years). The inside view adjustments are minor and roughly cancel out. I settle at approximately 4%, reflecting:
- Very strong historical precedent against Schedule 1 use
- Short 68-day window
- No current indicators of imminent escalation
- Genuine but small uncertainty about dramatic escalation scenarios

---

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will a state actor use a Schedule 1 CWC chemical weapon in pre-2014 Ukraine territory between Feb 22 and May 1, 2026, confirmed by NATO/OPCW?

2. **Outside view base rate**: 4.5% — zero Schedule 1 uses confirmed in 3+ years of conflict; this specific 68-day window is ~6% of that period.

3. **Consistency check**: "4 out of 100 times, Russia (or another state) uses a Schedule 1 nerve agent or similar in Ukraine and NATO/OPCW confirms it by May 1, 2026." This is plausible given the very low historical base rate but non-zero escalation risk.

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - Zero Schedule 1 chemical weapons confirmed in 3+ years of Ukraine conflict (strong No)
   - All confirmed use involves CS/chloropicrin (non-Schedule-1) (strong No)
   - EU/OPCW sanctions confirm ongoing chemical use but not Schedule 1 (neutral to No)
   - Peace negotiations ongoing, reducing escalation incentive (weak No)
   - Russia demonstrated Schedule 1 capability (Navalny, Salisbury) but in non-battlefield contexts (weak Yes)

5. **Blind spot**: If Russia faces catastrophic military collapse in the 68-day window and uses novichok or sarin in desperation, this forecast looks too low. This scenario is unlikely but not impossible (~1-2% probability itself).

6. **Status quo**: Status quo is continued non-Schedule-1 chemical use, which does NOT resolve Yes. The world changes slowly; a dramatic escalation to Schedule 1 agents is a significant departure from the established pattern.

Probability: 4%
