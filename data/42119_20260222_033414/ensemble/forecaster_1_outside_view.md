Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Arms Control Association (armscontrol.org, Dec 2024)**: Reputable arms control policy organization. Reports OPCW's confirmed finding of CS agent in samples from Illinka, Dnipropetrovsk region (September 2024 incident). Factual reporting on OPCW findings. High quality, credible.

2. **The Moscow Times (July 4, 2025)**: Independent English-language outlet covering Russia. Reports Dutch (MIVD/AIVD) and German (BND) intelligence joint findings on chloropicrin and tear gas use. This is a future date relative to the question opening (Feb 22, 2026), but the article is dated July 2025 — so it is historical from today's perspective. The intelligence agencies cited are credible NATO member state bodies. High quality.

3. **Al Jazeera (July 4, 2025)**: Major international broadcaster. Corroborates the Dutch/German intelligence findings. Adds detail on BND characterization of chloropicrin as "more serious CWC violation." Credible.

4. **The Independent (July 4, 2025)**: UK broadsheet. Further corroborates the same July 2025 intelligence findings. Adds UK MoD response (sanctions, respirators). Credible.

5. **Agent Report**: Comprehensive synthesis of official accusations and findings from Feb 2022 through mid-2025. Includes OPCW TAV reports (Nov 2024, Feb 2025), U.S. State Department formal determination (May 2024), Dutch/German intelligence (July 2025), UK MoD response (July 2025). Well-structured with sourcing. The agent report is a secondary synthesis — quality depends on underlying sources, which appear credible. Key factual claims are corroborated by multiple primary sources.

**Critical resolution note**: The question resolves based on events **after February 22, 2026** (the question opening date). All the events described above (OPCW findings Nov 2024, Feb 2025; U.S. determination May 2024; Dutch/German intelligence July 2025) are **prior to the resolution window**. The question asks whether chemical weapons use will occur (and be officially confirmed) between Feb 22, 2026 and May 1, 2026.

**However**, the resolution criteria also says "a state actor intentionally uses chemical weapons anywhere within the pre-2014 land territory of Ukraine" — and the question resolves per credible accusations from NATO members or OPCW. Given the established pattern of ongoing use (thousands of incidents documented through 2025), the question is really asking whether this pattern continues into the Feb 22 – May 1, 2026 window AND whether it meets the specific resolution criteria.

**Key resolution constraint**: The fine print specifies "Chemical weapon means a chemical listed at OPCW's Annex on Chemicals Schedule 1." This is more restrictive than the general CWC definition. CS (tear gas) and chloropicrin are **NOT** Schedule 1 chemicals. Schedule 1 includes nerve agents (novichok, sarin, VX, etc.) and other highly toxic agents. This is a critical distinction — all confirmed use to date involves agents that are NOT Schedule 1.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

**Reference Class 1: Historical use of Schedule 1 chemical weapons in active conflicts**
Very rare. Syria used sarin and chlorine (Schedule 1 and 2 respectively) — but this took years to escalate. In Ukraine specifically, no Schedule 1 agent has been confirmed despite 3+ years of conflict. Base rate: very low.

**Reference Class 2: Continuation of confirmed chemical weapons use in ongoing conflicts**
Russia has been using riot control agents and chloropicrin continuously since 2022, with escalating frequency. If the question resolved on CWC-prohibited use broadly (not just Schedule 1), the base rate would be near-certain. But the fine print restricts to Schedule 1 only.

**Reference Class 3: Escalation from Schedule 3/riot control agents to Schedule 1 agents**
This is the key transition. In Syria, escalation from chlorine to sarin took ~2 years. Russia has not used Schedule 1 agents in Ukraine despite 3+ years. The deterrence from NATO's "severe consequences" warnings remains strong.

**Most suitable**: Reference Class 1 combined with the Syria precedent for escalation. The base rate for Schedule 1 use in this conflict specifically is very low — essentially zero confirmed cases in 3+ years.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The resolution window is **February 22 to May 1, 2026** — approximately **68 days** (about 2.3 months).

Historical pattern: Despite thousands of documented chemical incidents in Ukraine, **zero** have involved Schedule 1 agents. The OPCW has confirmed CS (not Schedule 1) and the U.S./European intelligence confirmed chloropicrin (Schedule 3, not Schedule 1). The pattern over 3+ years shows Russia using sub-Schedule-1 agents tactically.

For the question to resolve Yes, Russia (or another state actor) would need to:
1. Use a Schedule 1 chemical agent in Ukraine
2. Have this confirmed by a NATO member or OPCW

The 68-day window is short. The status quo is continued use of non-Schedule-1 agents. There is no indication of imminent escalation to nerve agents.

**(d) Justification**

The critical insight is the **Schedule 1 restriction** in the fine print. This dramatically narrows the resolution criteria compared to the broader question title. All documented chemical weapons use in Ukraine — confirmed by OPCW, U.S., Dutch, German, and UK authorities — involves:
- CS/CN (riot control agents, not Schedule 1)
- Chloropicrin (Schedule 3, not Schedule 1)

Schedule 1 agents include nerve agents (novichok, sarin, tabun, VX), mustard gas, lewisite, and similar highly toxic agents. Russia has not used these in Ukraine despite 3+ years of conflict and thousands of chemical incidents.

**Factors favoring Yes (Schedule 1 use)**:
- Escalating conflict dynamics
- Russia's demonstrated willingness to use prohibited chemicals
- Possible ceasefire negotiations creating pressure to use decisive weapons
- Precedent: Russia used novichok in Salisbury (2018) outside of warfare context

**Factors favoring No**:
- 3+ years of conflict with zero Schedule 1 use despite massive conventional and chemical (sub-Schedule-1) escalation
- Strong NATO deterrence specifically against Schedule 1 use
- Russia's tactical needs are being met with riot control agents and chloropicrin
- Short 68-day window
- No intelligence reports suggesting imminent Schedule 1 use
- Russia's denial strategy works better with deniable agents (CS, chloropicrin) than with distinctive nerve agents

The base rate for Schedule 1 use in this conflict is effectively 0/3+ years. The probability of it occurring in a specific 68-day window is very low.

Outside view calibration:

- Base rate: ~0 confirmed Schedule 1 uses in 3+ years of conflict = roughly 0% per 68-day period historically in this conflict
- Adjusting upward for: escalation risk, Russia's demonstrated norm-breaking behavior, possibility of ceasefire-related escalation, general uncertainty
- The question also resolves based on accusations from NATO members — but NATO members have been careful to accuse Russia of using CS and chloropicrin (not Schedule 1 agents), suggesting they would only make Schedule 1 accusations if they had strong evidence
- Comparable situation: Syria used Schedule 1 agents, but only after years of escalation and under very different military circumstances
- The 68-day window is short; even if Russia were to escalate to Schedule 1 use at some point in 2026, the probability of it happening in this specific window is low
- I estimate approximately 4-6% probability, reflecting genuine but small risk of dramatic escalation
