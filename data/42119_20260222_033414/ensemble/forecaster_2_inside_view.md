Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Ukrinform (Nov 25, 2025)** – Ukraine elected to OPCW Executive Council; Russia excluded for third consecutive time. High-quality factual reporting from a Ukrainian state-affiliated outlet. Key factual content: Ukraine's election, Russia's exclusion, Sybiha's characterization of Russia as "systematic violator." The "11,000 uses" figure comes from Ukrainian official statements and should be treated as advocacy rather than independently verified fact.

2. **Al Jazeera (Feb 13, 2026)** – Munich Security Conference coverage. High quality, no chemical weapons content relevant to Ukraine battlefield use. Irrelevant to resolution.

3. **Moscow Times (Feb 14, 2026)** – NATO SG Rutte interview on Russian casualties and aid. High quality, no chemical weapons content. Irrelevant to resolution.

4. **The Sun (Feb 17, 2026)** – NATO jets scrambled, Russia missile blitz. Tabloid source, moderate quality. No chemical weapons allegations. Irrelevant to resolution.

5. **Oneindia (Feb 21, 2026)** – Boris Johnson calls for noncombat troops. Johnson mentions Syria's chemical weapons use as historical precedent for Western inaction. No new allegations about Ukraine. Weak relevance.

6. **RTS.ch (Feb 21, 2026)** – Sabrina Dallafior appointed first female OPCW head. High quality (Swiss public broadcaster). Key expert opinion: Natasha Hall (CSIS) warns "the taboo against chemical weapons has weakened." Factual: OPCW confirmed destruction of all declared stockpiles in 2023; ongoing allegations against Russia in Ukraine. Moderate relevance—confirms ongoing institutional concern but no new specific use allegation.

7. **Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (Feb 20, 2026)** – Navalny epibatidine poisoning. High quality publication. Factual core: UK, Sweden, France, Germany, Netherlands confirmed epibatidine use in Navalny's death. This is a Schedule 1 agent use by Russia—but outside Ukraine's territory and not on a battlefield. Relevant to Russia's willingness to use CW but not to the specific resolution criteria (use in Ukraine's pre-2014 territory).

8. **Medium.com (Feb 17, 2026)** – Ukraine Update blog post. Low quality (personal blog). Claims Russia has used chemical weapons since November 2022 including chloropicrin, and that OPCW confirmed violations in 2025. Consistent with other sources but not independently authoritative. Notes EU sanctions in May 2025 attached to condemnation.

9. **Вечерняя Москва (Dec 12, 2025)** – Russian military expert Dandykin claims Ukraine may use chemical weapons. Very low quality for factual purposes—Russian state-adjacent media, named expert is a known pro-Kremlin commentator. This is Russian counter-narrative/disinformation. Essentially irrelevant to resolution.

10. **RT (Oct 10, 2025)** – Russian envoy Tarabrin presents "evidence" at OPCW of Ukrainian chemical weapons use. Low quality for factual purposes—RT is Russian state media. The claim (IED with chloroacetophenone/chloropicrin found in Donetsk) is a Russian counter-accusation. Neither agent is Schedule 1. Weak relevance.

11. **EU Council (Oct 13, 2025)** – Extension of chemical weapons sanctions; three Russian entities added May 2025 for development and use in Ukraine. High quality (official EU Council press release). Key factual: EU formally sanctioned Russian entities for CW use in Ukraine in May 2025. This is strong institutional confirmation of Schedule 3/RCA use, but the EU sanctions do not specify Schedule 1 agents.

12. **Tunisie Numerique (Oct 14, 2025)** – OPCW Executive Council vote context. Medium quality. Confirms OPCW TAVs found CS in grenades/soil near front lines. No Schedule 1 confirmation.

13. **Korrespondent.net (Nov 25, 2025)** – Ukraine elected to OPCW. Medium quality (Ukrainian news). Repeats "11,000 uses" figure from Ukrainian official statements.

14. **Various Ukrainian defense export articles** – Irrelevant to resolution.

**Key factual synthesis from sources:**
- Russia has been confirmed/accused of using CS, CN, chloropicrin (Schedule 3 or unscheduled RCAs) in Ukraine—confirmed by OPCW TAVs and EU sanctions (May 2025).
- No NATO member state, OPCW, or credible Western source has alleged battlefield use of a Schedule 1 agent in Ukraine as of Feb 22, 2026.
- Russia used epibatidine (Schedule 1) against Navalny, but outside Ukraine.
- The question resolves based on Schedule 1 agents specifically (per the fine print: "Chemical weapon means a chemical listed at OPCW's Annex on Chemicals Schedule 1").

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence toward NO:**
- Four years of intensive conflict with zero confirmed Schedule 1 use in Ukraine, despite extensive OPCW monitoring and Western intelligence surveillance. This is a powerful structural baseline. (Strong weight)
- The resolution criteria specifically requires Schedule 1 agents. All confirmed/accused uses in Ukraine involve Schedule 3 or unscheduled agents (CS, CN, chloropicrin). This is a critical distinction—the question does NOT resolve on RCA or choking agent use. (Strong weight)
- EU sanctions (May 2025) and OPCW TAVs confirm sub-Schedule-1 use, but no escalation to Schedule 1 has occurred despite these documented violations. (Strong weight)

**Moderate evidence toward NO:**
- Russia faces severe deterrence against Schedule 1 use: NATO has explicitly warned of "severe consequences." The political cost would be enormous, especially given ongoing peace negotiations (Geneva talks Feb 17, 2026). (Moderate weight)
- Russia's current military strategy appears to be achieving objectives through conventional means + RCAs, reducing incentive to escalate to Schedule 1. (Moderate weight)

**Weak evidence toward YES:**
- Navalny epibatidine poisoning (Feb 2026 confirmation) shows Russia's continued willingness to use Schedule 1 agents outside Ukraine. (Weak—different context, not battlefield)
- CSIS expert Natasha Hall warns "the taboo against chemical weapons has weakened." (Weak—general observation, not Ukraine-specific)
- Russian military expert Dandykin's claims about Ukraine stockpiling agents (Russian counter-narrative, very low credibility). (Negligible)

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The question opened February 22, 2026 and resolves May 2, 2026—approximately **69 days** (~2.3 months).

If the timeframe were halved (~35 days): probability would drop to roughly 1.0-1.2%, as there would be even less time for an unprecedented escalation.

If the timeframe were doubled (~138 days): probability might rise to ~2.5-3%, as there would be more opportunity for escalation, but the structural barriers remain the same.

The 69-day window is short, and the status quo (no Schedule 1 use) has persisted for 4+ years.

**(d) Justification**

The outside view established ~1.7%. The key inside-view considerations:

1. **Critical definitional clarification**: The fine print specifies "Schedule 1" agents only. This is far more restrictive than the question title implies. All documented Russian chemical use in Ukraine involves non-Schedule-1 agents. This is the single most important factor and strongly anchors the probability near the lower end.

2. **Four-year precedent**: Despite intense conflict and documented sub-threshold chemical use, Russia has not crossed the Schedule 1 line in Ukraine. This is a strong structural constraint.

3. **Active peace negotiations**: Geneva talks (Feb 17, 2026) and ongoing diplomatic activity create additional disincentive for Russia to escalate to Schedule 1 use, which would collapse negotiations and trigger severe Western response.

4. **Navalny epibatidine case**: While this shows Russia's Schedule 1 capability and willingness, it was a covert assassination, not battlefield use. The contexts are fundamentally different.

5. **No credible pre-resolution-window evidence**: The question only counts events after Feb 22, 2026. There is no evidence of imminent Schedule 1 use.

The inside view slightly lowers the outside view estimate because:
- The Schedule 1 restriction is more limiting than my reference class assumed
- Active peace talks provide additional deterrence
- The 69-day window is short

**Inside view: ~1.5%**

---

**Probability Calibration**

Base: 1.7% (outside view)
- Schedule 1 restriction (more limiting than reference class): -0.3%
- Active peace negotiations as additional deterrent: -0.2%
- Navalny case shows ongoing Schedule 1 willingness (slight upward): +0.1%
- Short 69-day window: already incorporated in outside view

**Final: ~1.3-1.5%**

---

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Russia (or any state) use a Schedule 1 chemical weapon on Ukrainian pre-2014 territory between Feb 22 and May 1, 2026, confirmed by NATO/OPCW?

2. **Outside view base rate**: 1.7% (time-scaled reference class of battlefield Schedule 1 use). Final prediction of ~1.5% is rooted in this.

3. **Consistency check**: "1.5 out of 100 times, a state actor uses a Schedule 1 chemical weapon in Ukraine before May 1, 2026." This is consistent with four years of no such use and the restrictive Schedule 1 definition.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - All confirmed CW use in Ukraine is non-Schedule-1 (CS, chloropicrin) ✓
   - EU sanctioned Russia for CW use in Ukraine (May 2025) but for sub-Schedule-1 agents ✓
   - Zero Schedule 1 allegations in 4 years of intense conflict ✓
   - Active peace negotiations reduce escalation incentive ✓
   - Navalny epibatidine shows Schedule 1 capability but different context ✓

5. **Blind spot**: Russia could use a Schedule 1 agent in a battlefield context that is then confirmed by NATO intelligence within the 69-day window. This would be unprecedented but not impossible—perhaps 1-2% probability itself.

6. **Status quo**: No Schedule 1 use in 4 years. Status quo strongly favors NO.

Probability: 1.5%
