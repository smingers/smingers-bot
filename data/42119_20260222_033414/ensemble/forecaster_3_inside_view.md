Analysis:
1) Resolution-criteria alignment (crucial)
- This resolves **Yes** only if a **state actor** intentionally uses a **CWC Schedule 1** toxic chemical **as a weapon** somewhere in **pre‑2014 Ukrainian territory** between **2026‑02‑22 and 2026‑05‑01** (inclusive window per prompt), as supported by **credible sources** (e.g., **OPCW** or an accusation/determination by a **NATO member state**).
- This is *much narrower* than “any chemical use” or “riot control agents in warfare.” Under the fine print, **CS/tear gas (unscheduled)** and **chloropicrin (Schedule 3)** would **not** satisfy resolution.

(a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; date)
Web sources in prompt
- Ukrinform (Nov 25, 2025) — Ukraine elected to OPCW Executive Council; Russia excluded again. Credible as a report of a diplomatic event, but also a Ukrainian state-aligned framing (“systematic violator”). **No new Schedule 1 use evidence.**
- Al Jazeera (Feb 13, 2026) — about transatlantic ties; only notes Germany renounced WMD including chemical weapons. High-quality outlet, **not relevant** to CW use in Ukraine.
- The Moscow Times (Feb 14, 2026) — NATO/Ukraine war context; no chemical content. Generally credible. **No relevance**.
- The US Sun (Feb 17, 2026) — tabloid; mixed reliability; claims about NATO pilots etc. **No CW claim**; weak as evidence.

AskNews articles
- Oneindia (Feb 21, 2026) quoting Boris Johnson — commentary advocating noncombat troops; references Syria CW norm erosion historically. Secondary reporting; **no Ukraine Schedule 1 claim**.
- rts.ch (Feb 21, 2026) on incoming OPCW head — reputable Swiss public broadcaster. Mentions “increasing use” and broader norm erosion; mostly background/analysis. **No specific, dated Schedule 1 incident in Ukraine in-window.**
- Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists (Feb 20, 2026) — high-quality analysis piece arguing Navalny case as CWC violation (epibatidine/analogue). Relevant to Russia’s **willingness/capability** to use exotic toxic chemicals, but **not about battlefield Schedule 1 use in Ukraine** and may not map cleanly onto Schedule 1 / “method of warfare” criteria.
- Medium (Feb 17, 2026) “Ukraine Update” — not an institutional newsroom; quality varies; contains strong claims (e.g., OPCW “confirmed violations in 2025,” chloropicrin use). Even if true, these are typically **non‑Schedule‑1**. **Weak-to-moderate** due to platform/attribution issues.
- Russian-language pieces (vm.ru Dec 12, 2025; RT Oct 10, 2025; Rambler Feb 20, 2026) — state-influenced or propaganda-adjacent; largely allegations that Ukraine would/use chemicals; poor track record. **Weak** and mostly outside the resolution window anyway.
- EU Council/Consilium press release (Oct 13, 2025) — very high-quality primary source; confirms EU sanctions regime and additions in May 2025 linked to chemical weapons issues. However, sanctions relate to **prior allegations** and do not establish **Schedule 1 use in-window**. **Moderate** for demonstrating sustained concern/monitoring.
- Tunisie Numerique (Oct 14, 2025) — secondary explanatory piece; includes that OPCW missions found CS etc, but attribution limited. **Moderate-low** relevance, and again tends to concern non‑Schedule‑1 agents.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution criteria)
Strong evidence (large shifts)
- None in the provided current material indicating **new (post‑2026‑02‑22)**, **Schedule 1**, **state-actor**, **in-Ukraine** use, or imminent official NATO/OPCW determination.

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
- EU/UK-style sanctions and repeated official concern (Consilium Oct 2025; also referenced May 2025 additions): indicates **continued scrutiny** and institutional readiness to condemn. This modestly raises the chance that any true Schedule 1 event would be **rapidly labeled** by credible sources, but does not itself raise the underlying incidence rate much.
- OPCW governance changes/Ukraine on Executive Council (Ukrinform Nov 2025; rts.ch Feb 2026): could marginally improve speed/visibility of any future determinations, but **July 2026 leadership change is after the window**.

Weak evidence (small shifts)
- Commentary pieces about norm erosion (Bulletin; rts.ch; Oneindia; Medium): plausible mechanism (“taboo weakening”), but not tied to a concrete, in-window trigger for Russia (or another state) to cross into **Schedule 1 battlefield use**.
- Russian allegations about Ukrainian chemical preparations (RT/vm.ru): low credibility and also often cite agents (phosgene, chloropicrin) that aren’t Schedule 1; limited value.

Key structural/status-quo factor (heavily relevant)
- The war has seen repeated allegations/indications of **non‑Schedule‑1** chemical use (e.g., RCAs; chloropicrin) for years without an evident shift to **Schedule 1** battlefield use. That pattern suggests a deliberate “stay-below-the-red-line” strategy and is a strong predictor of continued restraint over a short horizon.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Forecast window length: ~**68–69 days** (from 2026‑02‑22 to 2026‑05‑01).
- If the window were **halved** (~1 month): probability would drop meaningfully (fewer opportunities for escalation/accident/decision), roughly to ~**3–4%**.
- If the window were **doubled** (~4.5 months): probability would rise, but not linearly; escalation risk accumulates with major offensives/crises. Roughly to ~**7–10%** (still constrained by strong deterrence and Russia’s revealed preference so far).

(d) Justification (updating the 5% outside view to an inside view)
Outside view base rate (given): **5%** for Schedule 1 CW use (as determined by credible sources) within this short window.

Reasons to nudge upward (small)
- Continued institutional attention (EU sanctions regime; persistent CW discourse) means a genuine Schedule 1 incident is more likely to trigger a **clear official accusation** (helping resolution) rather than remain ambiguous.
- Analytical signals of norm erosion (OPCW head appointment context; Bulletin) mildly increase tail-risk that Russia (or another state actor) could test limits.

Reasons to nudge downward (small-to-moderate)
- No current, credible reporting (as of today, the window start) indicates **imminent** Schedule 1 battlefield use.
- Strong deterrence remains: Schedule 1 use is the clearest “red line” and invites severe retaliation/escalation risks, while Russia has achieved tactical effects with lower-level agents/means.
- The resolution criterion is unusually strict (Schedule 1 only). Many “chemical weapons” headlines in this war are about **CS/chloropicrin** and would **not** count.

Net update
- These factors mostly **offset**: slightly better odds of decisive attribution *if* an event happens, but little evidence the event rate itself rises in the next ~2 months.
- I therefore keep the inside-view probability close to the outside-view anchor, with only a marginal adjustment.

Probability calibration
- Outside view: 5%
- Inside view adjustments:
  - +0.5 to +1.0 pp for stronger institutional readiness/visibility (EU sanctions regime, OPCW salience)
  - −0.5 to −1.0 pp for lack of any new in-window trigger signal + continued incentive to avoid Schedule 1 threshold
- Inside view rounded: **5%**

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Between Feb 22 and May 1, 2026, will a government actor use a **Schedule 1** chemical weapon in **pre‑2014 Ukraine**, per OPCW/NATO-member credible sourcing?”
2. Outside view base rate: 5%.
3. Consistency check: “About **5 out of 100** such windows see a credible NATO/OPCW-confirmed/accused **Schedule 1** CW use in Ukraine.” Plausible given strict criteria and short horizon.
4. Key evidence (most influential):
   - Strict criterion: **Schedule 1 only** excludes most reported agents (CS, chloropicrin).
   - Multi-year revealed preference: heavy allegations of lower-level chemical use without clear Schedule 1 escalation.
   - No credible, specific current reporting of imminent Schedule 1 use as of window start.
   - Continued Western/EU monitoring/sanctions readiness (increases chance of clear labeling if it occurs).
5. Blind spot: A sudden major battlefield crisis (e.g., imminent defeat/encirclement) triggers desperate use of **mustard/nerve agent**, followed by rapid NATO attribution—would push probability sharply higher (into ~15–25% for the remaining window).
6. Status quo outcome: Continued non‑Schedule‑1 chemical incidents and mutual accusations, but **no** Schedule 1 threshold crossing → **No**.

Probability: 5%
