Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis

1) **OPCW overview / CWC text (OPCW.org, evergreen reference)**
- **What it provides (facts):** Authoritative definitions, treaty obligations, and the OPCW’s role.
- **Quality:** Very high for definitions and institutional procedures. Not event-specific.
- **Relevance caveat:** The question’s *resolution criteria* further restrict “chemical weapon” to **Schedule 1** chemicals (a narrower set than “toxic chemicals” or riot control agents used as warfare).

2) **Arms Control Association summary of OPCW finding (Dec 2024 article about an Illinka incident)**
- **What it provides (facts):** OPCW-confirmed lab identification of **CS (tear gas)** in samples tied to a battlefield incident; OPCW noted treaty violation (use of riot control agent as a method of warfare).
- **Quality:** High as secondary reporting on OPCW documentation; Arms Control Association is a reputable niche outlet.
- **Key limitation for *this* question:** **CS is not Schedule 1**, so—even if it’s a chemical weapon in the broader CWC “method of warfare” sense—it does **not** directly indicate Schedule 1 use.

3) **The Moscow Times (July 4, 2025) on Dutch/German intelligence claims**
- **What it provides (facts as reported):** Dutch and German services said Russia increasingly uses chemical agents; mentions **chloropicrin** and tear gas; references U.S. sanctions/determination.
- **Quality:** Medium. It reports on official intelligence statements, which is useful, but is still downstream journalism and can lack technical precision.
- **Relevance caveat:** **Chloropicrin is not Schedule 1**. It suggests norm erosion / operational familiarity, but not a direct bridge to Schedule 1 battlefield use.

4) **Al Jazeera (July 4, 2025) on same intelligence claims**
- **What it provides (facts as reported):** Similar: intelligence services allege chloropicrin + tear gas, with quotes and Russia’s denial.
- **Quality:** Medium-high as mainstream reporting, but again secondary.
- **Relevance:** Same limitation: not Schedule 1.

5) **The Independent (July 4, 2025) on same intelligence claims**
- **What it provides:** Similar narrative; emphasizes “widespread” use.
- **Quality:** Medium; tabloid-ish tendencies but still largely quoting official statements.
- **Relevance:** Again about non–Schedule 1 agents.

6) **Agent_report (compiled, mixed sources; contains internal inconsistencies)**
- **What it provides (claims):** A timeline of alleged/official accusations; highlights **U.S. May 1, 2024 determination** re chloropicrin; OPCW TAV confirmations of **CS**; European intelligence claims.
- **Quality:** Mixed/uncertain. It usefully aggregates, but includes at least one **material mismatch** with the forecasting question: it discusses riot control agents and chloropicrin extensively, and even labels them in ways that may confuse Schedule status. I treat it as a *lead generator*, not a clean factual record.
- **Most decision-relevant takeaway:** Across all listed items, **no source indicates an OPCW/NATO-member “confirmation” of Schedule 1 use in Ukraine to date**; the pattern is **non–Schedule 1** agents.

**Bottom line from sources:** The public/official discussion to date centers on **riot control agents (e.g., CS)** and **chloropicrin**—serious, but **not Schedule 1**. That strongly suggests (i) if Schedule 1 use were occurring, it is either not happening or not being officially affirmed, and (ii) escalation to Schedule 1 would be a major additional step.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view)

Because the resolution criterion is **Schedule 1 use in Ukraine**, the best reference classes are those involving **battlefield use of Schedule 1 agents by states** and the frequency of **confirmed/officially attributed** incidents.

Candidate reference classes:

1) **Interstate wars (post-1945) with confirmed Schedule 1 battlefield use**
- Examples are scarce; the standout is **Iran–Iraq War** (nerve agents like tabun/sarin).
- Suitability: High for “state actor + battlefield,” but very small-N and different geopolitical environment.

2) **Civil/intrastate wars with confirmed Schedule 1 use and international attribution**
- Example: **Syria** (sarin use; international investigations/attribution debates).
- Suitability: Moderate. Shows that Schedule 1 use can occur and be officially asserted, but Syria differs: weaker deterrence constraints vs a nuclear-armed peer adversary context.

3) **Russia–Ukraine war to date (2022–Feb 2026): pattern of chemical allegations and confirmations**
- We have repeated allegations and some confirmations of **non–Schedule 1** agents.
- Suitability: High for *local trend*, but it mostly informs that **Schedule 1 has not (publicly/officially) crossed the line**.

**Most suitable outside-view baseline:** A blend of (1) and (3): modern interstate war under intense scrutiny + heavy deterrence, with many opportunities but strong disincentives. That combination historically implies **very low base rates** of Schedule 1 battlefield use.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Resolution window:** From **today (2026-02-22)** to **2026-05-01**: about **68 days (~2.2 months)**.
- **Status quo if nothing changes:** Continued allegations/claims involving **riot control agents/choking agents**; no major-power official confirmation of **Schedule 1** use.
- **Historical pattern over similar periods:** In conflicts where Schedule 1 is *not already in routine use*, it tends to remain absent; when it appears (e.g., Syria), it often clusters around particular campaigns and can recur. Ukraine has had ~4 years of full-scale war without public, official confirmation of Schedule 1 use; that implies a **very low per-2-month hazard rate**.

---

### (d) Justification (outside view)

Key outside-view considerations pushing probability **down**:
- **High escalation cost:** Schedule 1 nerve agents carry a uniquely strong stigma and are more likely to trigger severe international responses than RCAs/chloropicrin.
- **Historical rarity in interstate wars:** Confirmed Schedule 1 use by states in modern interstate conflict is extremely uncommon.
- **Observed revealed preference:** Even amid a brutal, prolonged war and (per sources) alleged use of other toxic chemicals, actors appear to have **stopped short of Schedule 1**—suggesting a meaningful deterrent or operational/political constraint.
- **Confirmation/attribution constraint:** The question requires “confirmed use” resolving via credible sources (OPCW/NATO member accusations). Even if a small event occurred, it might not be *officially affirmed* within the window.

Considerations pushing probability **up** (but less strongly):
- **Norm erosion / operational familiarity:** If use of non–Schedule 1 agents is becoming “standard practice” (per intelligence claims), that could marginally increase risk of further escalation.
- **Battlefield desperation / miscalculation:** A localized commander decision, false-flag dynamics, or an attempted tactical breakthrough could raise tail risk.
- **Short window still includes many engagements:** High operational tempo gives many “draws from the urn,” though the event remains rare.

Overall, the outside view is: **very low probability** over ~2 months, but not zero.

Outside view calibration:

- A rough tether from the sources is *negative evidence*: despite extensive scrutiny and many alleged chemical incidents, **none are Schedule 1** (as presented here). This suggests the *baseline* probability of Schedule 1 use is far below the probability of “any chemical incident” broadly defined.
- For a 68-day window in a conflict that has not previously crossed the Schedule 1 threshold (at least not with official confirmation), I’d set a base-rate in the **~1% range**.
- Upset rate consideration: “black swan” escalations do happen, but for Schedule 1 in an interstate war under heavy intelligence surveillance, the upset rate is still low. I nudge slightly above 1% to reflect norm erosion and miscalculation risk, but keep it clearly sub-5%.

Outside View Prediction:
**1.32%**
