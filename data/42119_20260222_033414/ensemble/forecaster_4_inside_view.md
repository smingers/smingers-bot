Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Ukrinform, 25 Nov 2025 – Factual report of OPCW Executive-Council vote.  High reliability; no allegation of Schedule-1 use, only Ukrainian political rhetoric.  
2. EU Council press release, 13 Oct 2025 – Primary institutional source extending sanctions for chemical-weapons proliferation, names three Russian entities.  High reliability; does not specify Schedule-1 battlefield use.  
3. Medium blog post, 17 Feb 2026 – Author claims Russia has used chloropicrin “11 000 times”; cites delayed OPCW confirmation.  Low–moderate reliability (single author, no document links); agent cited is not Schedule-1.  
4. RT, 10 Oct 2025 – Russian envoy accuses Ukraine of toxic-agent use.  Low reliability (state propaganda outlet); agents named (chloroacetophenone, chloropicrin) are non-Schedule-1.  
5. Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, 20 Feb 2026 – Navalny poisoning retrospective.  High reliability but event occurred inside Russia, not Ukraine; nerve agent use for assassination, not battlefield.  
6. Aggregate mainstream war reporting (Al Jazeera, The Sun, Moscow Times, etc., Feb 2026) – None mention chemical weapons.  Shows topic salience is currently low.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (status-quo):  
• Four years of full-scale war with intense ISR coverage yet no NATO/OPCW accusation of Schedule-1 use. (structural, historical)  
Moderate evidence (slightly increases risk):  
• Documented battlefield use of non-Schedule-1 irritants (CS, chloropicrin) indicates partial norm erosion.  
• EU and U.S. sanctions naming Russian entities for CW activity show Western governments think the program exists.  
Weak evidence (noise, both directions):  
• Blog/RT reciprocal accusations; no independent corroboration or Schedule-1 linkage.  
• Upcoming peace-talk dynamics – speculative effect on incentives.

Net weighting: strong evidence keeps probability low; moderate evidence pulls it very slightly upward; weak evidence discounted.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Window left: 68 days.  If halved to 34 days my estimate falls to ~0.7 %.  If doubled to 136 days it rises to ~2 %.  Short horizon sharply limits hazard rate for so rare an escalation.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (modern interstate wars with no prior Schedule-1 use): 1.3 %.  
Adjustments:  
+0.2 % for observed norm erosion with irritants, showing some willingness to test limits.  
–0.4 % for current de-escalatory diplomatic environment (Geneva talks, Russia seeking sanctions relief).  
Net inside-view: 1.1 %.  Odds ≈ 1 in 90 that a credible NATO member or OPCW accusation of Schedule-1 use occurs before 1 May 2026.

Probability calibration
I expect that about 1–2 times in 100 comparable two-month periods we would see a qualifying Schedule-1 chemical-weapon incident in Ukraine.  Current period is slightly below that midpoint.  Therefore:

Probability: 1.1 %

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “From 22 Feb 2026 to 1 May 2026, will a government’s forces use a Schedule-1 chemical weapon in pre-2014 Ukraine, confirmed by NATO member or OPCW?”  
2. Base rate stated: 1.3 %.  
3. Consistency – “Roughly 1 in 90 times, the criterion is met.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • No prior Schedule-1 confirmation after 4 yrs of war.  
   • Only irritant agents (CS, chloropicrin) publicly alleged/confirmed.  
   • EU/US sanctions cite CW programs but not battlefield nerve-agent use.  
   • Active peace talks lower escalation incentive.  
5. Blind-spot – A sudden Russian battlefield collapse prompting desperate last-minute nerve-agent barrage could raise odds to >20 %.  
6. Status-quo – Continuation of four-year pattern (no Schedule-1) is overwhelmingly likely; probability nudged toward status-quo.

Probability: 1.1%
