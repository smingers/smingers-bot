**Assessing chemical weapons use**

I'm focusing on the forecast probability for whether any state actor will use chemical weapons in Ukraine before May 1, 2026. I've got an outside view base rate of 1.32% to start with. Looking for inside view adjustments, I didn’t find new sources indicating Schedule 1 use, but there's mention of chloropicrin allegations. While some suggest Russia has used it since November 2022, it’s not a Schedule 1 chemical. I’ll lightly adjust upward due to potential EU sanctions and OPCW oversight.**Evaluating chemical weapons probability**

I'm considering how the potential for chemical weapon use may escalate, especially with the upcoming Geneva peace talks and discussions of a ceasefire. Russia has a strong incentive to avoid major escalation, as it wants to negotiate and is wary of NATO's response. This might bring the probability slightly below the base rate of 1.32%. 

Taking into account the low risk of escalation but recognizing potential miscalculations, I’m estimating the final probability around 1.0% to 1.1%. I’ll analyze sources relevant to chemical weapons claims, weight evidence, assess the 68-day timeframe, and create a checklist for clarity.
