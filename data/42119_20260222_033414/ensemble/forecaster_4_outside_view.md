Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Arms Control Association news brief (Dec 2024).  Factual report on an OPCW Technical Assistance Visit that confirmed CS (a riot-control agent) was present in a 20 Sep 2024 incident.  High‐quality (draws on the publicly released OPCW report).  Does not allege Schedule 1 use, contains no opinion beyond the Director-General’s statement that the finding is a treaty violation.  
2. Moscow Times / Dutch & German intelligence press conference (4 Jul 2025).  Factual core: Dutch MIVD and German BND say Russia is increasingly using chloropicrin and CS.  Medium quality: intelligence agencies are credible but the article is secondary reporting; no primary documents published.  Contains political opinions (e.g., “slippery slope”) that are separated from the factual allegation.  No Schedule 1 agent is mentioned.  
3. Al Jazeera (4 Jul 2025) – same press conference, comparable quality.  
4. The Independent (4 Jul 2025) – same press conference.  
5. Agent_report – synthetic collation of open-source material up to Feb 2026.  Useful chronology, but secondary and potentially error-prone; I treat it as an index to check primary dates already covered above.  

Across all sources, every confirmed or officially accused agent (CS, CN, chloropicrin) is either an unscheduled riot-control agent or a Schedule 3 choking agent.  No NATO member state, no OPCW document, and not even Ukraine has (to date) alleged the battlefield use of a Schedule 1 agent (sarin, VX, sulphur mustard, novichok, etc.) in Ukraine.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:

1. “Any instance worldwide of Schedule 1 chemical-weapons use by a state actor in a given year since the CWC entered into force (1997).”  
   • Events: Syria (multiple 2013-18); DPRK (Kuala Lumpur assassination 2017); Russia (Skripal 2018; Navalny 2020). About 6 calendar years with at least one incident out of 29 → ≈ 21% yearly risk—globally.

2. “Schedule 1 use on an active, high-intensity battlefield since 1945.”  
   • Essentially Syria (2013-18) and Iran-Iraq (1980s).  That is ≈ 9 distinct conflict-years out of ~80, or ≈ 11% per conflict-year, but in only two theatres.

3. “Schedule 1 use in Ukraine since Russia’s February 2022 invasion.”  
   • Four full war-years (2022-2025) with zero such incidents → 0% empirical rate.

Reference class 1 is too broad (assassinations outside war zones).  
Reference class 3 is too narrow (only four data points).  
Reference class 2 (“battlefield Schedule 1 use by a state already accused of lesser chemical violations”) is closest to the situation we are evaluating.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until the question closes: 69 days (≈ 0.19 yr).  
If the per-war-year frequency of Schedule 1 battlefield use is 11% (ref class 2), the naïve, time-proportional probability over 0.19 yr is:  
0.11 × 0.19 ≈ 2.1%.

(d) Justification for the outside view  
• Status quo: Four consecutive years of war in Ukraine with no Schedule 1 allegations despite thousands of documented RCAs and Schedule 3 uses.  
• Capability and motive: Russia (the only plausible state actor) possesses Schedule 1 stocks and has precedent for overseas novichok attacks, but escalation to nerve-agent battlefield use would risk severe Western response and is not obviously militarily decisive.  
• Detection and attribution threshold: NATO and OPCW surveillance is intense; any actual nerve-agent use would likely be announced quickly, but the bar for NATO accusation is high (no such claim in four years).  
• Comparison with Syria: Syrian escalation to nerve agents occurred after many months of battlefield stalemate and with far weaker threat of external retaliation than Russia would face today.  
• Expert priors: Public betting markets that follow “chemical escalation in Ukraine” have traded in the 5-10 % range for “ever,” not “in the next two months.”  
• Upset rate: Even in conflicts where Schedule 3 or RCAs were routine, only a minority escalated to Schedule 1.  That historical “surprise” rate argues for a sub-5 % baseline in a short window.

Outside view calibration:

Start with the 2.1 % naïve figure (time-scaled reference class 2).  
Adjust upward +0.5 %: Russia’s demonstrated willingness to ignore CWC norms elsewhere.  
Adjust downward –1 %: exceptionally high political cost if Russia crossed the nerve-agent line in Ukraine under NATO’s gaze; plus no drift toward Schedule 1 evident despite escalating RCA use for two years.  
Add 0.1 % to acknowledge low-but-non-zero risk of a Ukrainian false-flag or accidental release being blamed on a state actor.  

Calibrated outside-view probability ≈ 1.7 %.

Outside View Prediction:
1.7 %
