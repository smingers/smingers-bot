Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Ukrinform (25-Nov-25) – factual OPCW Executive-Council vote, Ukrainian FM calls Russia “systematic violator”.  Primary, dated, reliable; contains political opinion.  
2. Medium.com “Ukraine Update” (17-Feb-26) – author claims OPCW has confirmed chloropicrin/CS use since 2022.  Single commentator, secondary; facts partly checkable, schedule-3 only.  
3. Al-Jazeera / Moscow Times / Sun pieces (13-17 Feb 26) – Munich-conference and missile-blitz reporting.  Large outlets, no CW content beyond passing mentions.  
4. AskNews pack (RT 10-Oct-25; EU Council 13-Oct-25; Bulletin 20-Feb-26 etc.) – mix of official statements, commentary, propaganda.  No Schedule-1 use documented; all incidents involve RCAs or assassination-style novichoks outside Ukraine.  

Overall: zero credible accusations of Schedule-1 agents in Ukraine up to 22-Feb-26; repeated, well- sourced accusations of Schedule-3/RCA misuse by Russia.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence (against “Yes”)  
• For four years Russia has limited itself to RCAs/chloropicrin despite heavy fighting and multiple stalemates – structural behavioural pattern.  
• NATO & US public “red-line” threats of severe retaliation for CW escalation – institutional deterrent.  

Moderate evidence (for “Yes”)  
• Russia possesses proven capacity and has shown willingness to use novichok abroad.  
• Battlefield is still trench-centric; chemical munitions could offer tactical advantages as spring offensives loom.  

Weak evidence  
• Propaganda claims (RT, Russian MoD) that Ukraine is stock-piling nerve agents.  No corroboration.  
• Commentators’ analogies to Syria/Iran-Iraq.

Weighting: strong anti-escalation evidence outweighs moderate pro-escalation factors for the short 70-day window.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time remaining: 69 days (22 Feb → 1 May 26).  
If window were halved to 34 days, odds roughly halve (to ~1½ %).  
If doubled to 138 days, odds would rise roughly four-fold (to ~6-7 %), still low because the taboo has held for four years.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (for a 14-month window) = 11 %.  Converting to daily hazard ⇒ 0.028 %/day.  Over 69 days ⇒ 1.9 %.  
Upside adjustments: +0.5 pp for current Russian pressure to break stalemate; +0.5 pp for possibility that a single NATO attribution (even if later disputed) is sufficient for resolution.  
Downside adjustments: –0.5 pp for Geneva peace-talk optics (CW use would torpedo Russia’s diplomatic narrative); –0.4 pp for unusually intense allied pre- signalling of “massive consequences”.  
Net: 1.9 % + 0.5 + 0.5 – 0.5 – 0.4 ≈ 2.0-2.1 %.  Rounded to 3 % to reflect tail-risk uncertainty.

Probability calibration
(a) Status-quo continuation (RCA misuse only) clearly points to “No”.  
(b) A ±10 % absolute swing (i.e., from 3 % to 13 % or –7 %) would imply qualitatively new intelligence (e.g., OPCW detecting Schedule-1 precursors in Russian depots near front) or proof Russia has started loading nerve-agent shells.  No such data presently exist.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Between 22 Feb 26 and 1 May 26, will any government forces employ a Schedule-1 chemical weapon inside pre-2014 Ukraine?”  
2. Base rate: 11 % over 14 months.  
3. Consistency: “Three times in 100 similar 69-day periods we’d expect a qualifying CW incident.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Four-year history of only Schedule-3 use.  
   • NATO’s reiterated ‘severe consequences’ warnings.  
   • Russia retains nerve-agent capability.  
   • Imminent peace talks may moderate escalatory incentives.  
5. Blind-spot: small covert nerve-agent drone strike blamed on Russia and swiftly attributed by NATO within the next two months.  Would raise probability markedly.  
6. Status-quo bias checked – maintains “No” outcome; slight nudge toward it adopted.

Probability: 3%
