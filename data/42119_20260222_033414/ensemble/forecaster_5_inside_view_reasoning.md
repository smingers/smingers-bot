**Forecasting chemical weapons use**

I need to produce a forecast regarding the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine before May 1, 2026. The outside view suggests an 11% likelihood. Now, I have to look for credible sources, like allegations from NATO members or the OPCW, since they involve Schedule 1 agents. It’s crucial to focus on the timeframe from February 22 to May 1, 2026. I recognize that my earlier outside view analysis covered too long a period, not fitting this context.**Revising chemical weapons forecast**

I’m reflecting on the question about whether any state actor will use chemical weapons in Ukraine before May 1, 2026. Today being February 22 means there are just over 2 months left, which changes my initial timeframe analysis significantly. The probabilities drop dramatically compared to a broader 14-month view. While there are ongoing allegations concerning Schedule 3 agents, the likelihood of Schedule 1 usage is lower in this short window. I need to account for potential escalations, like peace talks or military actions, when adjusting my forecast.**Examining internal factors for chemical weapons**

I'm analyzing factors that could lead to the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine before May 1. Desperation from Russia might escalate, especially with ongoing peace talks, but they could also hold back to avoid derailing discussions. There are reports of Russian use of tear gas, but turning to Schedule 1 agents involves more risk than benefit in this condensed timeframe. With the muddy season affecting logistics, the internal probability seems to land around 3%. I’ll consider the potential for false-flag events and gather sources before finalizing my analysis.
