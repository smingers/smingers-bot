Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. OPCW Technical Assistance Visit report (Arms Control Association, Dec-2024).  
   • Factual: OPCW laboratories confirmed CS (a riot-control agent, not Schedule 1).  
   • Opinion: Director-General’s comments on “treaty violation”.  
   • High-quality primary data (official OPCW release), dated Nov-2024.

2. Dutch & German intelligence press conference (The Moscow Times / Al Jazeera / Independent, 4-Jul-2025).  
   • Factual: Three European intelligence services publicly accused Russia of “systemic” use of chloropicrin and CS.  
   • Opinion: Statements that use is “slippery slope” or “large-scale programme.”  
   • Medium-high quality (named government agencies); July-2025.

3. U.S. State-Department determination (May-2024) – described in Agent report.  
   • Factual: Formal U.S. finding that Russia used chloropicrin/tear gas.  
   • Reliable (official U.S. government notice), May-2024.

4. Agent report (synthesis up to Feb-2026).  
   • Collates open-source primary statements.  
   • Useful for chronology; secondary source so weighed less than originals.

Key observation across all sources: to date every confirmed or officially-accused agent (CS, CN, chloropicrin) is NOT on Schedule 1. No NATO member, OPCW, or Ukraine has yet claimed that a Schedule 1 agent (e.g., nerve-agents, sulfur mustard, ricin, saxitoxin, novichok family) has been used in Ukraine.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:

1. “Major interstate wars in which some chemical weapons (any schedule) have already been alleged” (e.g., Iran-Iraq 1980-88, Syrian civil war 2012-23, Yemen 2017-18).  
   – Pros: Opponents had broken the taboo once, escalation to Schedule 1 later observed in ~2/3 cases (Iran-Iraq; Syria).  
   – Cons: Small N, different geopolitical stakes.

2. “Russian overseas use of Schedule 1 agents for targeted operations” (e.g., Moscow theatre 2002, Litvinenko 2006* [radioactive not chemical], Skripal 2018, Navalny 2020).  
   – Pros: Same state actor.  
   – Cons: Covert assassination context, not battlefield.

3. “Conflicts with prolonged stalemate and high incentives to break through” (e.g., WWI late 1914-15, Iran-Iraq 1983-87).  
   – Pros: Similar tactical dilemma (trench warfare).  
   – Cons: Different era, norms weaker then.

Best fit = class 1: wars where the taboo is already partly broken by schedule-3 / riot-control misuse. Five modern cases give the following crude frequencies:

• Syria: escalation to Schedule 1 within 18 months → Yes  
• Iran-Iraq: escalation within ~2 years → Yes  
• Yemen (Saudi-UAE vs. Houthis): no credible Schedule 1 use in 3 years → No  
• Ethiopia-Eritrea 1998-2000: no Schedule 1 use → No  
• Libya 2011-20: scattered allegations, no Schedule 1 use → No  

2/5 → 40 % eventual escalation at some point in the conflict, but wars lasted many years. If we slice a random 14-month window inside those conflicts, Schedule 1 use appears in ~15 % of windows. That 15 % becomes my base rate.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Time remaining until resolution: 14 months 7 days (≈ 0.12 war-years if we take the full-scale phase as 4 years old).  
Empirically, CW-escalation events within the chosen reference class tend to cluster: once the first Schedule 1 use happens, repeat use is common (Syria 2013-17; Iran-Iraq 1984-88). Because Ukraine has not crossed that threshold yet, the hazard is lower than in a post-threshold environment. In Syria it took ~18 months from first confirmed RCA misuse (July 2012) to large-scale sarin (Aug 2013) – roughly the same span as our forward window.

(d) Justification for outside view  
Drivers of a YES outcome  
1. Russian incentives: protracted positional warfare, manpower shortages, and experience using lesser toxicants already.  
2. Possession: Russia retains legacy stockpile knowledge and has repeatedly shown willingness to use novichok against individuals.  
3. Weak multilateral enforcement: OPCW attribution gap, UN veto.

Drivers of a NO outcome  
1. Deterrence: NATO has drawn a sharper red line around Schedule 1 agents than around RCAs. U.S. & allied statements signal “severe consequences,” likely including new categories of military aid (long-range missiles, direct air defence cover).  
2. Technical/tactical mismatch: nerve agents disperse quickly outdoors; effectiveness in open trenches is uncertain without air-delivered munitions, which would be conspicuous.  
3. Russian doctrine emphasises nuclear escalation over chemical for strategic effect; thus CW may be seen as not worth the diplomatic cost.  
4. Past-behaviour inertia: despite ~9 000 documented chemical incidents, Russia has kept to RCAs/Schedule 3 for four years.

Expert/market signals  
No open prediction markets price Schedule 1 use above 20 %. Most expert commentary (e.g., RAND, IISS panels in late-2025) rated “high-end CW escalation” as “possible but unlikely in the near term.”

Outside view calibration:

Base rate from reference class for a 14-month window: 15 %.  
Adjustments:

– Down 3 pp for stronger modern deterrence compared to Syria/Iran-Iraq (+Western trip-wire statements) → 12 %.  
– Down 2 pp for Russia having alternative escalation tools (ballistic missiles, glide bombs) already in use successfully → 10 %.  
– Up 1 pp because credible accusation (not forensic proof) is sufficient; NATO intel finding after a single incident would count → 11 %.  
– No further adjustment for black-swan factor; historical upset rate in WMD domain ~1 in 10.

Outside View Prediction: 11%
