**Verifying chemical classifications**

It's crucial to clarify that CS gas isn't classified as a Schedule 1 substance, but possibly as Schedule 2. The Annex indeed lists Schedule 1 as extremely restricted weapons like mustard gas and sarin. Thus, our focus narrows to Schedule 1 chemicals like nerve agents if the question is to be resolved affirmatively. To date, there have been no accusations of Schedule 1 use in Ukraine, making the probability of that scenario rather low. Credible sources like NATO or OPCW would be essential for any accusations.**Evaluating escalation probabilities**

I'm analyzing the potential for Russia to escalate to using nerve agents. I'll summarize the main sources like Arms Control and Dutch analyses, focusing on instances of Schedule 1 chemical weapon use since 1945, such as Syria, the Iran-Iraq war, and past Russian actions. Historically rare, these instances give about a 15% chance of Schedule 1 use across conflicts. Considering Russia’s history of nerve agent use for assassinations, I’ll estimate a base probability of about 10% for escalation in the next 14 months. Accusations may come from NATO if credible evidence arises, but actual use seems less likely.
