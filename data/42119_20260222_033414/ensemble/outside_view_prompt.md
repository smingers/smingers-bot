You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will any state actor use chemical weapons in Ukraine before May 1, 2026?

Question background:
Chemical weapons are defined in line with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Importantly, this category is not limited to Cold War–era nerve agents. Under the CWC, even riot control agents (e.g., CS “tear gas”) may qualify as chemical weapons if used as a method of warfare, rather than for domestic law-enforcement purposes.

OPCW overview:
[https://www.opcw.org/](https://www.opcw.org/)

Chemical Weapons Convention text:
[https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention](https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention)

So what?

Use of chemical weapons would represent a major escalation of the conflict and a serious violation of international law. Such use could trigger new sanctions, diplomatic escalation, changes in military assistance, and heightened involvement by international institutions. NATO officials have repeatedly warned that the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine would carry severe consequences.

Because attribution and verification are difficult in active conflict zones, official statements—rather than forensic certainty available to the public—play an outsized role in shaping international responses. As a result, the question focuses on whether an official determination or accusation is made, not on whether the allegation is ultimately proven beyond dispute.

What’s happened so far (context for forecasters)

Since the start of the war, allegations of chemical weapons use in Ukraine have been recurrent. Ukraine and some Western governments have accused Russia of using toxic chemicals, including riot control agents and choking agents, while Russia has issued counter-accusations.

The OPCW has conducted Technical Assistance Visits (TAVs) in response to Ukrainian requests and has published official statements and reports describing findings related to alleged chemical incidents. Some OPCW reporting has confirmed the presence of toxic chemicals consistent with riot control agents in certain samples, while noting limits on attribution depending on mandate.

In parallel, NATO member states have at times publicly accused Russia of chemical weapons use in Ukraine, including allegations involving substances such as chloropicrin or the use of riot control agents in combat settings.

## Summary

This article is a **legal definition entry** from the Legal Information Institute (LII) explaining the concept of **sovereignty**. It is not directly related to chemical weapons use in Ukraine.

### Key Points from the Article:

- **Sovereignty** refers to dominant power or supreme authority within a political entity.
- In **monarchies**, sovereign power resides in a ruler (e.g., king or queen); in **modern democracies**, it rests with the people and is exercised through representative bodies (e.g., Congress or Parliament).
- The sovereign is defined as the entity that **exercises power without limitation**.
- Per William Blackstone, sovereignty fundamentally encompasses the **power to make laws**.
- Sovereignty implies **autonomy** — the sovereign power is beyond the reach of external interference.
- Two notable and often contested aspects of sovereignty are:
  - **Eminent domain**: the sovereign's right to take private property for public use.
  - **Sovereign immunity**: protection of the sovereign from lawsuits.

## Summary: Dutch and German Intelligence Report on Russian Chemical Weapons Use in Ukraine

**Source:** The Moscow Times, July 4, 2025

### Key Findings from Intelligence Agencies

Dutch intelligence services (MIVD and AIVD) and Germany's foreign intelligence service (BND) jointly announced they have gathered evidence of Russia's **growing use of chemical weapons in Ukraine**, specifically identifying the agent **chloropicrin** — described as potentially fatal in high concentrations in enclosed spaces.

The agencies stated that:
- Russia's military leadership and its radiological, chemical, and biological defense forces are **"supporting" and "actively facilitating"** the use of banned agents on the battlefield.
- The use of **tear gas and chloropicrin by Russian troops has "become standard practice and commonplace."**
- Ukraine has documented **more than 9,000 chemical attacks** by Russian forces since the full-scale invasion began in 2022.
- **At least three Ukrainian deaths** have been directly linked to chemical exposure.
- Indirectly, chemical weapons use has caused greater casualties by forcing Ukrainian troops into the open, where they are killed by conventional weapons.

### Policy Responses

- **Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans** characterized the use as "systemic and large-scale," calling it a "slippery slope" threatening not just Ukraine but Europe and the broader international community, and called for **more sanctions, Russia's isolation, and continued military support for Ukraine.**
- The findings were made public to prevent the **"normalization" of chemical weapons use.**
- The **United States had previously imposed sanctions on Russia in May** for alleged use of chloropicrin and tear gas in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention.

### Russian Position

The Kremlin rejected the accusations as **"baseless"** and maintains it no longer possesses a military chemical arsenal, though it continues to face international pressure over transparency regarding alleged use of toxic agents.

### Attribution Note
Both Russia and Ukraine have accused each other of chemical weapons use during the conflict.

## Summary: Russia Expanding Chemical Weapons Use in Ukraine, Say European Intelligence Agencies

**Source:** Al Jazeera (reporting on statements from Dutch and German intelligence agencies)

### Key Intelligence Findings

- **Dutch MIVD** and **German BND** intelligence agencies jointly reported extensive evidence of Russia using banned chemical weapons against Ukrainian soldiers, representing a serious violation of international law.
- Substances identified include **chloropicrin** (a choking/lung warfare agent) and **tear gas** (a riot control agent).
- The BND explicitly noted that chloropicrin's use "represents a more serious violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention, which prohibits the use of this lung warfare agent under all circumstances."
- **Peter Reesink (MIVD head)** described "thousands of instances" of chemical weapons use, characterizing it as "part of a large-scale programme" rather than ad hoc battlefield use.
- Chloropicrin is reportedly deployed via drones to drive soldiers from trenches before killing them.

### Casualties and Symptoms
- At least **3 Ukrainian deaths** linked to Russian chemical weapons use.
- More than **2,500 people** reported symptoms related to banned substances, per Dutch Defence Minister Ruben Brekelmans.

### Official Positions
- **Russia denies** using prohibited weapons; Russian Foreign Ministry spokesperson Maria Zakharova claimed Russia found a Ukrainian cache containing chloropicrin.
- **Ukraine also denies** using chemical weapons.
- The **OPCW previously stated** (last year) that accusations from both sides were "insufficiently substantiated." No full OPCW investigation has been launched, as this requires a formal member-state request.

### Policy Responses
- Dutch Defence Minister Brekelmans called for **tougher sanctions** against Russia and exclusion from OPCW's Executive Council.

<Agent_report>
Query: List all official accusations or findings since Feb 2022 that a state actor used any Schedule 1 chemical weapon in Ukraine, citing NATO members, OPCW, or Ukrainian government. Include date, accusing body, alleged agent, and OPCW investigation results; summarize patterns.
# Official Accusations and Findings of Chemical Weapons Use in Ukraine Since February 2022

## Overview

Since Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine in February 2022, a substantial and growing body of official accusations, intelligence findings, and OPCW-confirmed laboratory results documents the use of toxic chemicals as weapons in Ukraine. The primary accused state actor is Russia. Below is a structured chronological account of all major official accusations, findings, and investigation results.

---

## Chronological Record of Official Accusations and Findings

### 1. Early War Period (February–December 2022)
**Accusing Body:** Ukraine (Note Verbale to OPCW, February 27, 2022)
**Alleged Agent:** Unspecified chemicals; concern about "false flag" provocations involving industrial chemicals
**Details:** Ukraine's Permanent Representation to the OPCW submitted a Note Verbale warning that Russian armed forces may be preparing false-flag provocations using chemicals, including explosions of industrial tanks. Multiple NATO member states (Latvia, Czech Republic, Germany, Canada, USA) echoed these concerns at the OPCW Executive Council 99th session (EC-99, March 8–11, 2022).
**OPCW Result:** No formal investigation launched at this stage; OPCW noted the situation was outside its direct mandate at the time.

---

### 2. Ongoing Battlefield Reports (2022–2023)
**Accusing Body:** Ukrainian Armed Forces / Ukrainian Ministry of Foreign Affairs
**Alleged Agents:** CS gas (2-chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile), CN gas (chloroacetophenone), chloropicrin, mercaptans (malodorants)
**Details:** The Ukrainian Armed Forces documented 465 instances of chemical weapon deployment from February 2022 through December 2023. Ukraine reported Russian use of improvised explosive devices and drone-dropped canisters containing toxic agents to dislodge troops from fortified positions.
**OPCW Result:** Monitoring ongoing; no confirmed findings published in this period.

---

### 3. U.S. State Department Formal Determination (May 1, 2024)
**Accusing Body:** United States (NATO member) — U.S. State Department
**Alleged Agents:** Chloropicrin (choking agent); riot control agents (CS/CN tear gas)
**Date:** May 1, 2024
**Details:** The U.S. State Department formally "made a determination" that Russia used the chemical weapon chloropicrin against Ukrainian forces in violation of the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). The State Department stated the use was "not an isolated incident" and was "probably driven by Russian forces' desire to dislodge Ukrainian forces from fortified positions." The U.S. also cited Russia's regular use of riot control agents as a method of warfare, also prohibited under the CWC. In response, the U.S. activated the Chemical and Biological Weapons Control and Warfare Elimination Act, reimposing sanctions including restrictions on foreign military financing, export licenses for defense articles, and sanctions against three Russian government entities linked to chemical/biological weapons programs and four associated companies. Nearly 300 total new sanctions were announced in the same tranche (BBC, May 2, 2024; 6abc, May 3, 2024).
**OPCW Response (May 7, 2024):** An OPCW spokesperson stated the secretariat had been monitoring the situation since February 2022, described it as "volatile and extremely concerning," but said information provided by both Russia and Ukraine was "insufficiently substantiated" to reach a formal conclusion. The OPCW invited states with further information to share it (Chemistry World, May 9, 2024).

---

### 4. First OPCW Technical Assistance Visit (TAV) — Report Published November 18, 2024
**Accusing Body:** OPCW Technical Secretariat (at Ukraine's request)
**Alleged Agent:** CS (2-Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile) — riot control agent
**Incident Date:** September 20, 2024 (confrontation near village of Illinka, Dnipropetrovsk region)
**TAV Deployment:** July 2024
**Details:** Ukraine requested the TAV under Article VIII of the CWC. The OPCW team collected documentation, digital files, witness testimonies, and three samples (a grenade shell and two soil samples from a trench). Two separate OPCW-designated laboratories independently confirmed the presence of CS. OPCW Director-General Fernando Arias stated the findings represented a treaty violation and reiterated the secretariat's commitment to upholding the norm against chemical weapons. Ukraine requested the full report be made public and shared with all states-parties. The report was released one week before the annual CWC Conference of States Parties (November 25–29, 2024, The Hague) (Arms Control Association, December 2024).
**Attribution:** The OPCW report confirmed CS presence but did not formally attribute responsibility to a specific party, consistent with its TAV mandate.

---

### 5. Second OPCW Technical Assistance Visit — Report Published February 14, 2025
**Accusing Body:** OPCW Technical Secretariat (at Ukraine's request)
**Alleged Agent:** CS (2-Chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile) — riot control agent
**Incident Dates:** Three separate incidents in October 2024 (confrontation lines, Dnipropetrovsk region)
**Details:** Ukraine requested investigation of three incidents. The OPCW deployed TAV teams on two missions, collecting documents, digital files, witness testimonies, and environmental samples. Two independent OPCW-designated laboratories confirmed CS presence in all three incidents. Director-General Arias specified CS was used in riot-control-agent grenades. The OPCW Technical Secretariat clarified its mandate was to determine whether toxic chemicals were present, not to identify the source of the grenades (Arms Control Association, April 2025; Ukrinform, February 14, 2025).
**Ukrainian MFA Statement (February 14, 2025):** Ukraine's MFA stated the findings confirmed "systematic" Russian violations of the CWC, citing 6,129 documented cases of Russian use of munitions containing CS, CN, chloropicrin, and mercaptans from February 2023 to February 2025. Ukraine called for an international coalition to hold Russia accountable.
**Russian Response:** At the OPCW Executive Council meeting (March 4–7, 2025), Russia circulated a diplomatic note alleging "discrepancies" and questioning chain of custody. Russia also circulated a document (February 28, 2025) accusing Ukraine of using toxic chemicals. Ukraine rejected these as "disinformation."

---

### 6. Dutch and German Intelligence Joint Finding (July 4, 2025)
**Accusing Body:** Dutch Military Intelligence (MIVD), Dutch Security Service (AIVD), German Foreign Intelligence (BND) — all NATO members
**Alleged Agents:** Chloropicrin (choking agent, potentially lethal in enclosed spaces); CS gas (riot control agent)
**Date:** July 4, 2025
**Details:** Three European intelligence agencies jointly concluded that Russia's use of prohibited chemical weapons in Ukraine had become "standardized and commonplace." The MIVD head Peter Reesink cited "thousands of instances" of chemical weapons use (Ukraine's own figure: 9,000 total attacks). At least three Ukrainian deaths were attributed to chemical weapons use; more than 2,500 people reported chemical weapons-related symptoms to Ukrainian health authorities. Dutch Defense Minister Ruben Brekelmans stated: "The main conclusion is that we can confirm Russia is intensifying its use of chemical weapons." Germany's BND specifically noted chloropicrin as "more dangerous" than riot control agents and a "more serious violation of the CWC." Officials described the use as part of a "large-scale programme" rather than ad hoc frontline activity, suggesting direct instructions from Russian officials to soldiers (CBS News, July 4, 2025; The Independent, July 4, 2025).
**UK Response (July 2025):** The UK Ministry of Defence stated Russia's use was "unacceptable and of deep concern," confirmed provision of thousands of respirators and decontamination kits to Ukraine, and sanctioned a Russian research institute and two senior military officials connected to the violations (Forces News, July 17, 2025).

---

## Agents Identified

| Agent | Classification | CWC Status | Confirmed By |
|---|---|---|---|
| CS (2-chlorobenzylidenemalononitrile) | Riot control agent | Prohibited as method of warfare (Art. I.5 CWC) | OPCW (Nov 2024, Feb 2025) |
| CN (chloroacetophenone) | Riot control agent | Prohibited as method of warfare | Ukraine MFA; Reuters |
| Chloropicrin | Choking agent (Schedule 3) | Prohibited in warfare | U.S. State Dept (May 2024); Dutch/German intel (July 2025) |
| Mercaptans (malodorants) | Irritants | Potentially prohibited | Ukraine MFA |

---

## Patterns and Summary

**1. Escalating frequency:** Reported incidents have increased dramatically year-over-year, from 465 total in nearly two years (2022–2023) to 4,547 in 2024 alone, with monthly figures in early 2025 exceeding 800 per month.

**2. Tactical purpose:** The primary tactical use is to flush Ukrainian troops from fortified trenches and foxholes using drone-dropped canisters or grenades, followed by conventional fire or infantry assault. This pattern is consistent across Ukrainian, U.S., and European intelligence accounts.

**3. Agents used:** The dominant confirmed agents are CS and CN (riot control agents) and chloropicrin (a choking agent more toxic than standard tear gas). While CS/CN are not traditional "Schedule 1" agents under the CWC, their use as a method of warfare is explicitly prohibited under Article I(5) of the CWC. Chloropicrin is a Schedule 3 chemical.

**4. OPCW confirmation without attribution:** The OPCW has confirmed the presence of CS in battlefield samples on at least two separate occasions (November 2024 and February 2025), covering four distinct incidents. Its mandate under TAV requests does not extend to formal attribution, but Director-General Arias has characterized the findings as treaty violations.

**5. Western government formal accusations:** The U.S. made the first formal state-level determination in May 2024. Dutch, German, and UK intelligence/government bodies made formal findings in July 2025, representing a significant escalation in official Western characterizations from "allegations" to confirmed findings.

**6. No Schedule 1 nerve agents confirmed:** To date, no official body has confirmed the use of Schedule 1 agents (e.g., nerve agents such as novichok, sarin, VX) in Ukraine's active conflict zone. All confirmed or formally accused agents are riot control agents (CS, CN) or the Schedule 3 choking agent chloropicrin.

**7. Russia's denials and counter-accusations:** Russia consistently denies all allegations, characterizes them as Western propaganda, and has counter-accused Ukraine of chemical weapons use. Russia has used its OPCW Executive Council position to challenge procedural aspects of TAV reports.

**8. Accountability gap:** Russia's UN Security Council veto power and the OPCW's attribution-limited mandate create structural barriers to formal accountability. Enforcement has been limited to bilateral sanctions (primarily U.S. and UK) rather than multilateral CWC enforcement mechanisms.</Agent_report>
