    "description": "Chemical weapons are defined in line with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Importantly, this category is not limited to Cold War\u2013era nerve agents. Under the CWC, even riot control agents (e.g., CS \u201ctear gas\u201d) may qualify as chemical weapons if used as a method of warfare, rather than for domestic law-enforcement purposes.\n\nOPCW overview:\r\n[https://www.opcw.org/](https://www.opcw.org/)\n\nChemical Weapons Convention text:\r\n[https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention](https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention)\n\nSo what?\n\nUse of chemical weapons would represent a major escalation of the conflict and a serious violation of international law. Such use could trigger new sanctions, diplomatic escalation, changes in military assistance, and heightened involvement by international institutions. NATO officials have repeatedly warned that the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine would carry severe consequences.\n\nBecause attribution and verification are difficult in active conflict zones, official statements\u2014rather than forensic certainty available to the public\u2014play an outsized role in shaping international responses. As a result, the question focuses on whether an official determination or accusation is made, not on whether the allegation is ultimately proven beyond dispute.\n\nWhat\u2019s happened so far (context for forecasters)\n\nSince the start of the war, allegations of chemical weapons use in Ukraine have been recurrent. Ukraine and some Western governments have accused Russia of using toxic chemicals, including riot control agents and choking agents, while Russia has issued counter-accusations.\n\nThe OPCW has conducted Technical Assistance Visits (TAVs) in response to Ukrainian requests and has published official statements and reports describing findings related to alleged chemical incidents. Some OPCW reporting has confirmed the presence of toxic chemicals consistent with riot control agents in certain samples, while noting limits on attribution depending on mandate.\n\nOPCW Ukraine-related materials:\r\n[https://www.opcw.org/media-centre/news](https://www.opcw.org/media-centre/news)\n\n[https://www.opcw.org/resources/documents](https://www.opcw.org/resources/documents)\n\nIn parallel, NATO member states have at times publicly accused Russia of chemical weapons use in Ukraine, including allegations involving substances such as chloropicrin or the use of riot control agents in combat settings.\n\n`{\"format\":\"bot_tournament_question\",\"info\":{\"hash_id\":\"30c8b8bd1c30aff3\",\"sheet_id\":29.1}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question resolves as Yes if, after the opening of this question and before May 1, 2026, a state actor intentionally uses chemical weapons anywhere within the pre-2014 land territory of Ukraine.
