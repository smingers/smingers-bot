Analysis:
The key to this forecast is whether, since the start of 2025 and especially in early 2026, any authoritative body (OPCW, NATO member governments, or comparable) has accused a state actor—almost certainly Russia—of using chemicals that fall under CWC definitions inside Ukraine. Because only an official public accusation or determination is needed (full forensic proof is not), the most relevant sources are:
• OPCW press releases, Technical Assistance Visit (TAV) summaries, or Executive Council documents released in late-2025 or 2026.  
• NATO, U.S., U.K., or other allied government statements, press briefings, or intelligence assessments referencing “riot control agents,” “chloropicrin,” “CS gas,” “nerve agent,” etc., used as a method of warfare in Ukraine.  
• Ukrainian government claims can be useful but must be echoed or endorsed by a NATO member state or the OPCW to meet resolution criteria.  
Monitoring both mainstream coverage (Google News) and original documents (Google web) is important, while AskNews can aggregate policy-level statements over the last 12-14 months.
