Analysis:
To estimate the probability of future state-actor chemical-weapon use in Ukraine, the most useful historical context is: (1) every previous alleged or confirmed incident in Ukraine since the full-scale invasion; (2) which of those incidents were formally attributed or at least publicly accused by credible bodies such as the OPCW or NATO member governments; and (3) what kinds of agents were involved (Schedule 1 vs. riot-control agents used as weapons). Locating OPCW Technical Assistance Visit (TAV) reports, NATO statements, US/UK intelligence briefings, and Ukrainian/Russian government communiqués will give a timeline of precedent, showing both frequency and escalation patterns. Recent-year coverage (2024-2026) is especially important because it reflects current capabilities, intent, and international red-line signaling. Older Russian/Syrian precedents can supplement but Ukrainian-theatre data are the primary baseline. No economic data are required.
