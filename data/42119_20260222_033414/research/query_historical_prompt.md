You are currently doing research for historical information on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
Will any state actor use chemical weapons in Ukraine before May 1, 2026?

Question background:
Chemical weapons are defined in line with the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Importantly, this category is not limited to Cold War–era nerve agents. Under the CWC, even riot control agents (e.g., CS “tear gas”) may qualify as chemical weapons if used as a method of warfare, rather than for domestic law-enforcement purposes.

Chemical Weapons Convention text:
[https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention](https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention)

So what?

Use of chemical weapons would represent a major escalation of the conflict and a serious violation of international law. Such use could trigger new sanctions, diplomatic escalation, changes in military assistance, and heightened involvement by international institutions. NATO officials have repeatedly warned that the use of chemical weapons in Ukraine would carry severe consequences.

Because attribution and verification are difficult in active conflict zones, official statements—rather than forensic certainty available to the public—play an outsized role in shaping international responses. As a result, the question focuses on whether an official determination or accusation is made, not on whether the allegation is ultimately proven beyond dispute.

What’s happened so far (context for forecasters)

Since the start of the war, allegations of chemical weapons use in Ukraine have been recurrent. Ukraine and some Western governments have accused Russia of using toxic chemicals, including riot control agents and choking agents, while Russia has issued counter-accusations.

The OPCW has conducted Technical Assistance Visits (TAVs) in response to Ukrainian requests and has published official statements and reports describing findings related to alleged chemical incidents. Some OPCW reporting has confirmed the presence of toxic chemicals consistent with riot control agents in certain samples, while noting limits on attribution depending on mandate.

In parallel, NATO member states have at times publicly accused Russia of chemical weapons use in Ukraine, including allegations involving substances such as chloropicrin or the use of riot control agents in combat settings.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves as Yes if, after the opening of this question and before May 1, 2026, a state actor intentionally uses chemical weapons anywhere within the pre-2014 land territory of Ukraine. The question resolves according to [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) such as accusations from a NATO member state or from the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons ([OPCW](https://www.opcw.org/)).

Additional fine-print:
"State actor" is defined as a government of any [sovereign](https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/sovereignty) state, including its armed forces, security services, or other personnel acting in an official capacity. Only confirmed use of chemical weapons (as defined by the Chemical Weapons Convention) counts.&#x20;

"Chemical weapon" means a chemical listed at OPCW's [Annex on Chemicals Schedule 1](https://www.opcw.org/chemical-weapons-convention/annexes/annex-chemicals/schedule-1).&#x20;

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-22. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-22 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic or financial data, add a FRED query. Use a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate") or a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE"). Returns historical data with computed statistics.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one Agent query.
