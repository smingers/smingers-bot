In a BBC interview, Johnson emphasized that the presence of noncombat forces in peaceful areas post-ceasefire would signal that Ukraine is a free nation, not a vassal state of Russia. He criticized past Western inaction\u2014such as the failure to respond to Russia\u2019s 2014 annexation of Crimea, Syria\u2019s use of chemical weapons under Bashar al-Assad, and the chaotic US withdrawal from Afghanistan\u2014as factors that emboldened Vladimir Putin. Western military planners remain cautious, fearing Russian escalation, with Putin previously dismissing peacekeeping proposals and labeling foreign troops as legitimate targets. The UK Ministry of Defence confirmed that plans are underway for a multinational force under UK leadership to secure long-term peace after hostilities end, stating, 'The multinational force under UK leadership will secure peace for the long term.' Johnson\u2019s proposal marks a significant policy shift and reflects his ongoing advocacy for Ukraine\u2019s sovereignty.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 21, 2026 05:51 PM\nSource:[Oneindia](https://www.oneindia.com/international/boris-johnson-calls-for-noncombat-troops-in-ukraine-011-8005923.html)\n\n**Sabrina Dallafior Appointed First Female Head of OPCW Amid Escalating Global Chemical Weapons Threats**\nSabrina Dallafior, a Swiss diplomat with 25 years of experience, will become the first woman to lead the Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) in July 2026. Her appointment comes amid heightened global tensions, with increasing use of chemical weapons in Syria, Ukraine, the UK, and Malaysia over the past decade. The OPCW faces growing challenges from geopolitical rivalries between major powers\u2014particularly the US, China, and Russia\u2014while international support for multilateral disarmament institutions erodes. Despite the OPCW\u2019s 2023 achievement of verifying the destruction of all declared chemical weapons stockpiles, concerns remain about undeclared sites, such as over 100 suspected chemical weapons sites still in Syria, and ongoing allegations of chemical weapon use by state actors, including Georgia and Iran. The OPCW has also investigated high-profile poisonings, including those of Alexei Navalny (2020) and Sergei Skripal (2018), both linked to Russian intelligence. In response to these threats, the OPCW expanded its mandate in 2023 to include assigning responsibility for chemical attacks. Experts, including Natasha Hall from the Center for Strategic and International Studies, warn that the taboo against chemical weapons has weakened, with actors testing international tolerance. Additional risks stem from dual-use chemicals, advanced computing, and drone technology. Dallafior has stated that protecting the global norm against chemical weapons is her top priority, though this norm is increasingly under threat.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 21, 2026 01:06 PM\nSource:[rts.ch](https://www.rts.ch/info/monde/2026/article/sabrina-dallafior-premiere-femme-a-la-tete-de-l-agence-anti-armes-chimiques-29155902.html)\n\n**Russia calls it the 'nonsense with a frog.' The Navalny assassination is actually another chemical weapons violation**\nAlexei Navalny, the Russian opposition leader, died in a Siberian penal colony in February 2024 after being poisoned with epibatidine, a potent alkaloid found naturally in poison dart frogs of the Amazon rainforest. According to a joint statement by the UK, Sweden, France, Germany, and the Netherlands, the poisoning was confirmed by the UK\u2019s Defence Science and Technology Laboratory (Porton Down), which analyzed biological samples smuggled out of Russia. Epibatidine, which is hundreds of times more potent than morphine and lethal in small doses, has no natural source in Russia, and the poison dart frogs that produce it require specific Amazonian ecosystems\u2014making accidental exposure implausible. The use of a synthetic analogue of epibatidine points to deliberate chemical weapons development, consistent with Russia\u2019s history of violating the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). This follows the 2020 Novichok poisoning attempt, where Navalny survived after being poisoned on a flight from Tomsk to Moscow. Despite repeated denials from Russia\u2014calling the allegations 'nonsense with a frog'\u2014the pattern of brazen use followed by denial mirrors past incidents, including the 2018 Salisbury Novichok attack. Russia has systematically undermined international treaty mechanisms, such as the OPCW, by raising procedural objections and spreading disinformation about US-Ukraine biological weapons programs. The international community, including the UK, is now calling for stronger sanctions against Russian entities linked to chemical, biological, radiological, and nuclear capabilities, alongside enhanced military and diplomatic actions. The Munich Security Conference highlighted growing concern over the collapse of the rules-based international order, but the response to Navalny\u2019s assassination presents an opportunity for Western allies and the OPCW to reinforce the CWC and counter Russia\u2019s chemical aggression.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2026 08:57 PM\nSource:[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists](https://thebulletin.org/2026/02/russia-calls-it-the-nonsense-with-a-frog-the-navalny-assassination-is-actually-another-chemical-weapons-violation/)\n\n**Ukraine Could Export Military Goods Worth Several Billion Dollars in 2026, RNBO Says**\nUkraine may export military goods and services worth several billion dollars in 2026, following the lifting of its wartime export ban, according to Deputy Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council (RNBO) Davyd Aloyan in an interview with Reuters. The state commission approved most of 40 defense sector export applications in February 2024, with no applications involving finished weapons, but many focused on re-importing equipment to the front line. A significant portion relates to the U.S.-Ukraine FrankenSAM program, combining Soviet-era air defense systems with Western missiles. Ukraine is also considering an export tax on defense products to fund its military needs, as Russian forces continue advancing in eastern Ukraine and conducting air raids on cities far from the front. Aloyan emphasized that exports will prioritize countries most supportive of Ukraine in the war, including Germany, the UK, the U.S., Nordic nations, three Middle Eastern countries, and at least one Asian country. Interest from Middle Eastern nations is particularly strong in drones and heavy equipment. Ukraine aims to promote joint ventures and international cooperation to attract investment, establish new supply chains, and access advanced technologies. The country plans to open ten export centers in Baltic and Northern European countries in 2026. All technologies and production lines are based on Ukrainian-developed systems and specialists, with production already operational in the UK. Aloyan stated that commercial interests follow national and strategic priorities. Defense manufacturers are pushing for export restoration to avoid losing global market opportunities, with some already establishing subsidiaries abroad. The final decision on the export tax remains pending.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: February 20, 2026 03:00 PM\nSource:[OBOZREVATEL](https://www.obozrevatel.com/ukr/politics-news/ukraina-u-2026-rotsi-mozhe-eksportuvati-zbroi-na-kilka-milyardiv-dolariv-rnbo.htm)\n\n**Kolesnik: Zelenskyy's demand for a war plan until 2029 is a sign of agony and power prolongation**\nAndrey Kolesnik, a member of the State Duma's Committee on Defense, criticized Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's demand to develop a plan for continuing hostilities with Russia until 2029. According to Kolesnik, this requirement reflects Zelenskyy's 'agonizing' attempt to prolong his own power. He stated that Ukraine lacks independent military capabilities and relies entirely on Western support for weapons and personnel. 'Ukraine has no capabilities of its own; only the West\u2019s rear can supply them with weapons and manpower to continue fighting Russia. Zelenskyy can demand anything\u2014he is only prolonging his agony. Every day of warfare is a day of survival for him,' Kolesnik said.

The state commission responsible for issuing defense export licenses during wartime has approved most of the 40 applications submitted by defense sector producers. These include ready-made products, spare parts, components, and services, with the total value estimated in the billions of dollars. However, the official, Aloyan, emphasized that immediate export surges are not expected, as domestic military needs will take priority. Allied nations, including Germany, the UK, the US, Scandinavian countries, three Middle Eastern countries, and at least one Asian country, have shown interest in Ukraine\u2019s advanced defense technologies. One Middle Eastern country with a history of arms trade with Ukraine is exploring unmanned systems and heavy equipment. The SNBOD prioritizes exports to countries strongly supportive of Ukraine in the war. Ukraine also aims to establish joint ventures and international partnerships to attract funding, develop new supply chains, and access advanced technologies\u2014more important than simple exports of finished goods. Aloyan stated that the strategy focuses first on frontline and national interests, with commercial gains following. Ukraine is considering introducing an export tax on defense products to generate revenue for underfunded military needs, though the decision is not final. Notably, none of the approved applications involve exporting fully operational weapons; most are for re-exporting equipment to Ukraine for frontline use. Some applications relate to the Ukrainian-American FrankenSAM program, which combines Soviet-era Ukrainian systems with Western missiles.

According to S-topper Teresa Carvalho, it is 'reasonable' to require such treatment as a condition for early release from prison. This shift has created a majority in the Swedish Riksdag on the issue. The proposal gained momentum following SVT\u2019s Uppdrag Gransknings investigation into Swedish nationals involved in leading pedophile networks.

This marks the first time since the full-scale war began that Ukraine has approved foreign military exports. In early February, a state commission authorized most of 40 applications from defense sector producers for export licenses. Aloyan stated that the export potential, based on available finished products, spare parts, components, and services, amounts to 'several billion dollars.' He emphasized that the current export capacity is significantly higher than before Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022. Despite this, Ukraine's domestic defense needs remain the top priority, as the war continues. Aloyan noted that allies including Germany, the UK, the US, Nordic countries, three Middle Eastern nations, and at least one Asian country have shown interest in Ukraine\u2019s advanced defense technologies. Priority will be given to exports to strong allies. Ukraine also aims to promote joint ventures and international cooperation to attract financial resources, build new supply chains for frontline weapons, and gain access to new technologies. 'There is no desire or goal to block all producers and keep only domestic ones. The approach focuses on creating a system that prioritizes advanced and national interests, with commercial goals coming second,' Aloyan said. He added that Ukraine is considering introducing an export tax on defense manufacturers, which could help fund underfunded military needs. Notably, none of the approved applications involve exporting ready-to-use weapons; most are for re-importing equipment to Ukraine for frontline use. Reuters notes that Ukraine halted military exports after Russia\u2019s invasion in February 2022, but has since invested heavily in its defense industry, especially in drones and missiles. In 2025, enterprises under UkrOboronProm increased production by 1.5 times, and the Ministry of Defense approved over 1,300 new Ukrainian-made weapons and military vehicles for use\u201425% more than in 2024. In December 2025, Prime Minister Yulia Svyridenko stated that over 50% of Ukraine\u2019s military equipment was domestically produced.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 20, 2026 08:03 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/ukraine/events/eksport-oruzhiya-iz-ukrainy-v-snbo-zayavili-o-potenciale-na-milliardy-dollarov-v-2026-godu-50585490.html)\n\n**Ukraine's 2026 defence exports could hit 'several billion dollars', official says**\nUkraine's defence exports could reach several billion dollars in 2026, according to Davyd Aloian, deputy secretary of Kyiv's National Security and Defence Council.

In February 2026, Ukraine's wartime licensing commission approved the majority of 40 applications from defence producers for exports of materiel, spare parts, components, and services\u2014none involving ready-to-use weapons. Aloian stated that the total value of potential exports, including services and parts, amounts to 'several billion dollars,' significantly exceeding pre-war levels. Export priorities will favor countries that are strong supporters of Ukraine in the war, with an emphasis on joint ventures and cooperation to secure funding, build new supply chains, and access advanced technologies. Foreign interest has been expressed by Germany, Britain, the U.S., Nordic nations, three Middle East countries, and at least one Asian country, with one Middle East nation specifically interested in drones and heavy vehicles. Ukraine is also considering introducing an export tax on defence goods to generate revenue for its underfunded military. The commission's approved applications include reimporting arms to Ukraine for frontline use and support for the Ukraine-U.S. FrankenSAM program, which integrates Soviet-era systems with Western missiles.

Ukraine is seeking a seat for 2026\u20132028 to strengthen verification and accountability, while Russia is also pursuing a seat despite serious controversies. The OPCW\u2019s mandate prohibits the use, production, and stockpiling of chemical weapons, including tear gas (CS, CN) in warfare. Technical missions by the OPCW confirmed the presence of CS in grenades and soil samples near the front lines in Ukraine, though no official attribution of blame was made. Ukraine has documented thousands of incidents involving banned substances such as CS, CN, chloropicrine, and malodorous compounds used to dislodge soldiers from trenches\u2014prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention. In Syria, OPCW and UN investigations attributed multiple chemical attacks to the Syrian regime (using sarin and chlorine in 2017\u20132018), and Russia blocked UN investigations while attempting to hack the OPCW in 2018. Ukraine\u2019s candidacy is driven by its active cooperation with the OPCW\u2014providing samples, requesting assistance, training personnel, and updating laws. It aims to strengthen OPCW\u2019s responsiveness, uphold the ban on tear gas in war, and promote accountability. Russia\u2019s candidacy is undermined by its alleged use of banned substances in Ukraine and its past actions in Syria, raising concerns about its credibility. The vote is seen as a test of global commitment to maintaining a clear red line against chemical weapons. Tunisia, a State Party since 1997, is an active regional partner in Africa, hosting OPCW meetings, training programs, and serving on the Africa Programme\u2019s steering committee. Tunisia\u2019s role underscores its contribution to chemical weapons non-proliferation and regional security.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 01:15 PM\nSource:[Tunisie Numerique](https://www.tunisienumerique.com/opcw-ukraine-conseil-executif-armes-chimiques-syrie-2025/)\n\n**EU Continues Sanctions Against Chemical Weapons Proliferation and Use**\nOn October 13, 2025, the European Council decided to extend individual restrictive measures targeting the proliferation and use of chemical weapons for one year, until October 16, 2026. According to the Council, these sanctions will affect 25 physical and 6 legal persons.

He stated that Russian forces discovered an improvised explosive device (IED) in the Donetsk People's Republic in May containing a mixture of chloroacetophenone and chloropicrin\u2014chemicals that cause severe eye and lung irritation and are prohibited under the Chemical Weapons Convention (CWC). Tarabrin accused Western nations of 'turning a blind eye' to Ukraine's alleged use of chemical weapons and criticized them for promoting a 'parallel reality' portraying Ukraine as a democratic and responsible actor. He claimed that Western specialists are aware of the use of toxic chemicals but continue to display 'the utmost hypocrisy.' Tarabrin emphasized that Russia does not violate the CWC. According to the Russian Federal Security Service (FSB), the use of chemical agents on the battlefield has become 'commonplace' in Ukraine, with past discoveries including drones equipped with chloropicrin and a Ukrainian laboratory producing hydrogen cyanide, a lethal compound. The evidence presented was recorded by a certified laboratory and submitted to the OPCW under 'high standards.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 10, 2025 03:29 AM\nSource:[RT](https://www.rt.com/russia/626166-west-ignoring-ukrainian-chemical-weapons/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens (Small Models)', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
