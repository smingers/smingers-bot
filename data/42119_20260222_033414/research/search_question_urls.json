  "context": "\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/wex/sovereignty\">\n## Summary\n\nThis article is a **legal definition entry** from the Legal Information Institute (LII) explaining the concept of **sovereignty**. It is not directly related to chemical weapons use in Ukraine.\n\n### Key Points from the Article:\n\n- **Sovereignty** refers to dominant power or supreme authority within a political entity.\n- In **monarchies**, sovereign power resides in a ruler (e.g., king or queen); in **modern democracies**, it rests with the people and is exercised through representative bodies (e.g., Congress or Parliament).\n- The sovereign is defined as the entity that **exercises power without limitation**.\n- Per William Blackstone, sovereignty fundamentally encompasses the **power to make laws**.\n- Sovereignty implies **autonomy** \u2014 the sovereign power is beyond the reach of external interference.\n- Two notable and often contested aspects of sovereignty are:\n  - **Eminent domain**: the sovereign's right to take private property for public use.\n  - **Sovereign immunity**: protection of the sovereign from lawsuits.\n\n---\n\n**Relevance to the forecasting question:** This article provides only the **background legal definition of \"sovereignty\"** as referenced in the question's fine print (defining \"state actor\" as a government of any sovereign state). It contains **no information** about chemical weapons, Ukraine, Russia, or the OPCW.\n</QuestionSource>\n"
