Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **Intellectia.ai (Feb 2026) – Frontier CEO/AerCap deal**: Covers Q4 2025 earnings ($997M revenue, $0.23 EPS, beat expectations), Q1 2026 outlook (+10% revenue), AerCap aircraft return deal (no liquidity penalty), $200M cost savings target. Moderate quality (financial aggregator/commentary), but consistent with primary SEC filings. CEO statements are factual quotes from a Barclays conference. No bankruptcy indicators.

2. **Simply Wall St (Feb 8, 2026) – ULCC valuation**: Notes bearish concerns about losses and liquidity, but also highlights 71% 90-day stock rebound and +42% YTD. Mixed signals. Low-moderate quality (financial commentary, not primary research). The "liquidity concerns" are general editorial, not expert-attributed analysis.

3. **StockTitan/SEC 10-K (Feb 18, 2026)**: Frontier filed standard annual 10-K for FY2025. Accelerated filer status, ~$204M market cap (non-affiliates as of June 2025), 229M shares outstanding. **No going-concern language visible.** High quality (SEC filing = primary source). Filing a normal 10-K without going-concern qualifications is strong evidence against imminent bankruptcy.

4. **The Points Guy (Oct 2025) – Spirit bankruptcy**: Context on Spirit's second Chapter 11 (Aug 2025). Raymond James analysts called Spirit liquidation "highly likely." High quality sourcing (named analysts). Relevant only as sector context; no direct Frontier implications.

5. **Post and Courier/Reuters (Jan 26, 2026) – Castlelake/Spirit**: Frontier's November 2025 bid for Spirit deemed "unviable." High quality (Reuters wire). Suggests Frontier has capital constraints but is NOT itself distressed — it was attempting an acquisition, not seeking protection.

6. **Airline Weekly (teaser only) – "Is Frontier on the Verge of a Turnaround?"**: Paywalled; only teaser available. Notes Frontier "reinventing itself" with first-class seats, loyalty perks. Cautiously optimistic framing. Low utility due to incomplete content.

7. **Investing.com/Reuters (Feb 19, 2026) – "Frontier bets on budget travelers"**: **Most directly relevant article.** CEO Dempsey explicitly called bankruptcy rumors "categorically untrue." Q1 2026 RASM +10% YoY. Stock down 19% over 5 days and 44% over 1 year. JP Morgan's Jamie Baker (named expert) described Frontier's margins as "deeply negative" and "second only to Spirit's." Fleet reduction and $200M cost savings plan confirmed. High quality (Reuters-sourced).

8. **Bloomberg Law/Benzinga/Investing.com (Dec 16, 2025) – Spirit-Frontier merger talks**: Multiple sources confirming merger discussions. Frontier stock rose 7-9% on news. CEO Biffle replaced by Dempsey on same day. Moderate-high quality (Bloomberg primary). Merger talks collapsed (Frontier bid deemed unviable per Jan 2026 Reuters report).

9. **AskNews trucking/NJ layoffs/Korean bankruptcies articles**: Entirely irrelevant to Frontier Group Holdings. Zero weight.

10. **Airliners.de (undated/1970 timestamp) – Frontier denies bankruptcy**: Confirms CEO denial of bankruptcy rumors, $200M cost-cutting plan, first-class plans, RASM +10%. Corroborates Reuters article. Low-moderate quality (German aviation site, timestamp error suggests metadata issue).

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence against bankruptcy:**
- **FY2025 10-K filed without going-concern language** (primary SEC filing, Feb 18, 2026): Auditors must flag going-concern risk if bankruptcy is imminent. Absence of this language is a strong institutional/structural signal. *Strong evidence.*
- **CEO explicitly denied bankruptcy rumors as "categorically untrue"** (Reuters, Feb 19, 2026): While CEOs can be wrong, explicit public denial with specific forward-looking statements (Q1 RASM +10%, cost savings plan) creates legal liability if false. *Moderate-strong evidence.*
- **$874M total liquidity** (from outside view analysis of Q4 2025 balance sheet): Substantial buffer for a carrier of Frontier's size. Airlines typically file bankruptcy when liquidity is exhausted or near-exhausted. *Strong evidence.*
- **Credit facility expansion (December 2025)**: Lenders expanded revolving credit — banks conduct due diligence and would not extend credit to an imminently bankrupt entity. *Strong evidence.*
- **Q4 2025 profitability ($52M pre-tax)** and Q1 2026 RASM trending +10%: Improving financial trajectory. *Moderate evidence.*
- **AerCap deal with no liquidity penalty**: Proactive fleet rightsizing without triggering cash outflows. *Moderate evidence.*

**Moderate evidence of financial stress (but not bankruptcy-level):**
- **JP Morgan analyst Jamie Baker** (named expert): Called Frontier's margins "deeply negative" and "second only to Spirit's" — among worst peacetime margins ever. This is concerning but refers to margins, not liquidity or solvency. *Moderate evidence of stress, weak evidence of bankruptcy risk.*
- **Stock down 44% over 1 year, 19% over 5 days**: Market pricing in significant risk but not existential risk (stock still trading, not near zero). *Weak-moderate evidence.*
- **Frontier bid for Spirit deemed "unviable"**: Suggests capital constraints limiting acquisition capacity. *Weak evidence of distress.*
- **Ranked last in on-time performance (2025)**: Operational weakness but not a solvency indicator. *Weak evidence.*

**Sector context (indirect):**
- Spirit's repeated bankruptcies illustrate ULCC sector stress. However, Spirit had explicit going-concern language, covenant issues, and was burning cash at a rate Frontier is not currently experiencing. *Weak evidence (sector analog with meaningful differences).*

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The question window is **approximately 68 days** (February 22 to May 1, 2026). This is an extremely short window for a company with:
- $874M liquidity
- No going-concern language
- Expanding credit facilities
- Profitable recent quarter
- CEO actively denying bankruptcy

If the timeframe were **halved (~34 days)**: Probability would drop to approximately 1-1.5%. The shorter window makes any sudden shock scenario even less likely to materialize into a formal filing.

If the timeframe were **doubled (~136 days)**: Probability would rise to perhaps 4-6%, as macroeconomic deterioration, fuel spikes, or demand softening could become more impactful. The structural risks (thin margins, ULCC sector stress) would have more time to manifest.

The 68-day window is a significant constraint on the probability. Even if Frontier were to experience a sudden financial shock, the process of exhausting liquidity, triggering covenant breaches, and filing a petition typically takes months.

**(d) Justification**

The outside view base rate was established at ~3%, reflecting:
- Historical rarity of airline bankruptcies in any 2-month window
- Upward adjustment for ULCC sector stress
- Downward adjustment for Frontier's specific financial health indicators

The inside view evidence **reinforces the low probability**:

1. **No going-concern language in FY2025 10-K** is the single most powerful signal. This is a formal, auditor-reviewed document with legal consequences. Airlines approaching bankruptcy invariably receive going-concern qualifications months before filing.

2. **CEO's explicit denial** ("categorically untrue") combined with specific forward-looking operational metrics (RASM +10%) is credible given the legal liability of misleading investors.

3. **$874M liquidity** provides substantial runway. Even if Frontier were burning $100M/month (which would be extreme), it would have 8+ months of runway — well beyond the May 1 deadline.

4. **JP Morgan's bearish view** (deeply negative margins) is the most credible expert concern, but margins ≠ solvency. Frontier can operate with thin or negative margins as long as it has liquidity and lender support.

5. **The 68-day window** is the binding constraint. For a company with this liquidity profile, bankruptcy within 68 days would require an extraordinary, sudden shock — a scenario with very low probability.

The primary tail risk is a sudden macroeconomic shock (e.g., sharp demand collapse from recession fears, major fuel price spike, or a catastrophic operational event). These are low-probability in a 68-day window but not zero.

I'll adjust the outside view of 3% slightly downward to approximately **2.5%**, reflecting the additional confirmation from the CEO denial, the 10-K filing without going-concern language, and the very short timeframe.

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view was 3%. The inside view evidence is predominantly negative (against bankruptcy), with the CEO denial, 10-K without going-concern language, and strong liquidity all pointing strongly away from bankruptcy. The JP Morgan bearish view on margins is the main counterweight but is insufficient to move the needle significantly given the liquidity cushion.

Final calibration: **2.5%**

This reflects:
- ~97.5% probability that Frontier continues operating normally through May 1, 2026
- ~2.5% residual probability for tail risks (sudden demand collapse, fuel shock, hidden liquidity crisis not visible in public filings, or undisclosed covenant breach)

**Checklist:**

1. **Resolution criteria paraphrase**: Will Frontier Group Holdings (ULCC) or Frontier Airlines file Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy in any U.S. Bankruptcy Court between Feb 22 and May 1, 2026?
   - ✅ Analysis aligns with this definition. No bait-and-switch.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 3.0% established from historical airline bankruptcy frequency in 2-month windows, adjusted for ULCC sector stress and Frontier's specific indicators.
   - ✅ Final prediction of 2.5% is rooted in this base rate with modest downward adjustment.

3. **Consistency check**: "2.5 out of 100 times, Frontier Group Holdings files for Chapter 7 or Chapter 11 bankruptcy before May 1, 2026." ✅ This is consistent with the evidence showing strong liquidity, no going-concern language, and CEO denial, while acknowledging non-zero tail risk.

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - FY2025 10-K filed without going-concern language (Feb 18, 2026) ✅ Verified (primary SEC filing)
   - CEO Dempsey called bankruptcy rumors "categorically untrue" (Feb 19, 2026) ✅ Verified (Reuters)
   - $874M total liquidity as of Q4 2025 ✅ Verified (consistent across multiple sources)
   - JP Morgan analyst: "deeply negative margins, second only to Spirit's" ✅ Verified (Reuters, named expert)
   - 68-day window severely limits probability of sudden-shock bankruptcy ✅ Structural constraint

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: A hidden covenant breach or undisclosed credit facility withdrawal that triggers a sudden liquidity crisis — similar to how some companies appear healthy until they suddenly aren't. This could shift probability to 10-15%, but given the recent credit facility expansion and 10-K filing, this seems very unlikely.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Frontier continues operating as a going concern, executing its cost-cutting plan and fleet rightsizing. The status quo strongly supports No resolution. The situation is not highly volatile — it's a slow-moving restructuring story, not an acute crisis.

Probability: 2.5%
