Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **AlphaQuery (ULCC Long-Term Debt Data):** Financial data aggregator showing Q4 2025 balance sheet figures. Formal long-term debt of $357M, total assets ~$7.2B, total liabilities ~$6.73B. Mixed cash flow signals. Moderate quality — data aggregators can have formatting/attribution errors, but the figures are broadly consistent with other sources.

2. **Frontier Communications Q2 2025 article (investor.frontier.com):** Irrelevant — this is about Frontier Communications (FYBR), not Frontier Airlines (ULCC). Zero relevance.

3. **AZCentral/Arizona Republic (Spirit Airlines):** Covers Spirit Airlines' August 2025 second bankruptcy filing and going-concern language. High-quality regional newspaper. Relevant as peer context for ULCC sector stress, but not directly about Frontier Airlines.

4. **Post and Courier/Reuters (January 26, 2026):** Reports Castlelake talks to buy bankrupt Spirit; Frontier's November 2025 bid for Spirit deemed "unviable." High-quality sourcing (Reuters wire). Key finding: Frontier attempted to acquire Spirit but was rejected as unviable — this suggests Frontier had capital constraints but does NOT indicate Frontier itself is in distress.

5. **The Points Guy (October 2025):** Consumer guide on Spirit's second bankruptcy. Moderate quality, cites Raymond James analysts and Cornell/Embry-Riddle academics. Relevant as sector context only.

6. **Agent Report (comprehensive ULCC financial analysis):** Synthesizes Q4 2025 earnings release (PR Newswire, Feb 11, 2026) and FY2025 10-K (StockTitan, Feb 18, 2026). High detail, internally consistent. Key findings: $874M total liquidity, $52M Q4 2025 pre-tax profit, no going-concern language, revolving credit expanded, lease expirations 2027-2037, 69 aircraft deliveries deferred to 2031-2033. This is the most current and directly relevant source.

7. **FRED Jet Fuel Data:** Annual U.S. Gulf Coast jet fuel prices. 2025 annual average: $2.11/gallon (down 9.6% YoY). Favorable cost environment for airlines. High quality (Federal Reserve data).

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes are applicable:

- **All U.S. airlines filing bankruptcy in any given 2-month window:** Historically rare. Major U.S. airlines have filed roughly 10-15 times in the past 30 years. In any given 2-month window, the base rate is extremely low (<1% for any specific airline).

- **U.S. airlines with $800M+ liquidity filing bankruptcy within 2 months:** Essentially zero historical precedent. Airlines that file bankruptcy typically have exhausted liquidity (Spirit had ~$646M at filing but with $6.7B in liabilities and going-concern language). Frontier has $874M liquidity, no going-concern language, and expanding credit.

- **Ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs) in financial stress filing within 2 months:** Spirit filed twice, but Spirit had explicit going-concern language, covenant issues, and was burning cash rapidly. Frontier's profile is categorically different.

- **Airlines that attempted acquisitions and were rejected filing within months:** This is a weak signal. The failed Spirit bid suggests capital constraints but not imminent distress.

The most suitable reference class is **U.S. airlines with substantial liquidity ($800M+), no going-concern language, expanding credit facilities, and recent profitability filing for bankruptcy within 2 months.** The historical rate for this class is effectively 0%.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The question window is approximately **68 days** (February 22 to May 1, 2026). This is a very short window. Even for distressed companies, moving from apparent financial health to bankruptcy filing in 68 days is unusual unless there's a sudden shock (credit facility withdrawal, major covenant breach, catastrophic demand collapse). Frontier's current profile — $874M liquidity, profitable Q4, improving Q1 2026 RASM (+10% YoY) — provides substantial runway. The 68-day window significantly reduces the probability of an unexpected bankruptcy.

**(d) Justification**

The evidence strongly points away from bankruptcy:
- **Liquidity:** $874M total liquidity is substantial for a carrier of Frontier's size (~23% of TTM revenue). This provides months of operational buffer even in a severe downturn.
- **No going-concern language:** The FY2025 10-K (filed Feb 18, 2026) contains no going-concern qualifications — auditors would flag this if imminent bankruptcy risk existed.
- **Credit facility expansion:** Lenders expanded the revolving credit in December 2025 — a clear signal of continued lender confidence.
- **Profitability returning:** Q4 2025 was profitable ($52M pre-tax), and Q1 2026 RASM is trending >10% higher YoY.
- **Proactive restructuring:** The AerCap lease termination and Airbus delivery deferrals demonstrate management is addressing cost structure proactively — not reactively under creditor pressure.
- **Favorable fuel costs:** Jet fuel at $2.11/gallon (2025 average) is below the 5-year mean of $2.48, providing a tailwind.
- **Failed Spirit bid:** While the rejected acquisition attempt suggests capital discipline/constraints, it does not indicate distress.

The primary risks are macroeconomic (sudden demand collapse, fuel spike) or operational (major safety incident), both of which are low-probability in a 68-day window.

Outside view calibration:

The agent report estimates 3-6% probability. This seems reasonable but perhaps slightly high given the very short timeframe and strong liquidity position. 

For calibration anchors:
- Base rate for any specific airline filing in a 2-month window: ~0.5-1% (historical frequency of ~1 major filing per 2-3 years across ~10 major U.S. carriers)
- Adjustment upward for ULCC sector stress (Spirit's repeated bankruptcies): +1-2%
- Adjustment downward for Frontier's specific strong liquidity, no going-concern language, expanding credit: -1-2%
- Adjustment for the very short 68-day window: reinforces low probability

The 3-6% range from the agent report may be slightly conservative (i.e., too high) given the specific positive indicators. A range of 2-4% seems more appropriate. I'll settle at approximately 3%, acknowledging residual tail risk from macroeconomic shocks and the inherent uncertainty in financial forecasting.
