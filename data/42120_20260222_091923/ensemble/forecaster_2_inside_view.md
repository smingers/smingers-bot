**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence against bankruptcy (large negative shift):**
- CEO Jimmy Dempsey explicitly called bankruptcy rumors "categorically untrue" (Reuters, Feb 19, 2026) – direct denial from identifiable executive, on record
- 10-K filed for FY2025 with no going-concern language (SEC primary document) – structural/institutional indicator
- $874M liquidity ($654M cash + $220M revolver) per outside view analysis, no near-term debt maturities
- Q4-2025 profitable; Q1-2026 RASM +10% YoY; AerCap deal structured with "no liquidity penalty"
- Revolver expanded December 2025 – lenders remain supportive

**Moderate evidence against bankruptcy:**
- Fleet rightsizing (returning 24 aircraft, deferring 69 deliveries) – proactive restructuring without court involvement
- Jet fuel prices down ~10% YoY (favorable cost environment)
- Stock up 71% in 90 days (market not pricing imminent distress)
- Frontier attempted to acquire Spirit (Nov 2025 bid) – acquirers don't typically file bankruptcy weeks later

**Moderate evidence for bankruptcy (small positive shift):**
- JP Morgan analyst Jamie Baker: "deeply negative margins second only to Spirit" – credible named expert, concerning framing
- FY2025 net loss ~$137M; costs per ASM rose 7% YoY
- Stock down 44% over one year; 19% drop in 5 days (volatile sentiment)
- ULCC sector peer (Spirit) filed twice in 2024-25, demonstrating sector fragility

**Weak evidence for bankruptcy:**
- Simply Wall St flags "liquidity concerns" – opinion platform, no named expert
- General corporate bankruptcy surge in early 2026 (Korean data, trucking) – irrelevant sector

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The question resolves May 2, 2026, with the window opening February 22, 2026. That is **approximately 69 days (≈2.3 months)**.

- **If halved (~35 days):** Probability would drop further toward ~0.2-0.3%, as there would be even less time for a liquidity crisis to materialize from current stable position.
- **If doubled (~138 days):** Probability would rise modestly to perhaps 0.8-1.0%, as more time allows for exogenous shocks (demand collapse, fuel spike, credit event).

The short window is a key factor suppressing probability. Bankruptcy filings typically require weeks-to-months of deteriorating conditions, covenant breaches, and failed refinancing attempts. With $874M liquidity and no near-term maturities, none of these preconditions are present.

---

**(d) Justification**

The outside view established a 0.5% base probability, derived from a ~3% annual rate for ULCC peers scaled to a 69-day window.

**Factors shifting DOWN from base:**
1. **CEO explicit denial** (Reuters, Feb 19, 2026): "Categorically untrue" is a strong on-record statement. False statements to media about material facts create legal exposure; CEOs rarely make such categorical denials without confidence. This is the single most impactful piece of evidence.
2. **Strong liquidity position**: $874M liquidity with no near-term maturities makes a 69-day path to bankruptcy essentially require a catastrophic exogenous shock.
3. **Normal 10-K filing**: No going-concern language, no auditor qualification. This is a structural/institutional indicator that the company and its auditors see no near-term viability threat.
4. **Proactive restructuring underway**: Fleet returns, delivery deferrals, and cost-cutting are being executed voluntarily – exactly what a company does to *avoid* bankruptcy.
5. **Lender support**: Revolver expanded December 2025; banks don't expand credit to companies they expect to file within months.

**Factors preventing probability from going to near-zero:**
- JP Morgan's Baker noting deeply negative margins is a credible expert concern
- The ULCC sector has proven fragile (Spirit's double filing)
- Unknown unknowns: a sudden demand shock, fuel spike, or credit market disruption could theoretically accelerate distress
- The 69-day window, while short, is not zero

**Net assessment:** The current evidence is overwhelmingly inconsistent with a near-term bankruptcy filing. The combination of strong liquidity, CEO denial, clean 10-K, lender support, and improving revenue metrics makes this a very low probability event. I adjust from the 0.5% outside view base to approximately **0.3%**, reflecting that Frontier is materially healthier than the median ULCC peer in the reference class.

---

**Probability Calibration**

The outside view was 0.5%. The inside view evidence is predominantly and strongly negative (against bankruptcy). The CEO's categorical denial, clean 10-K, $874M liquidity, and no near-term maturities are collectively strong evidence. JP Morgan's concern about margins is real but describes a chronic problem, not an acute liquidity crisis. I settle on **0.3%** as my final estimate, maintaining a small non-zero probability for tail risks (sudden demand collapse, hidden off-balance-sheet obligations, or a black swan event in the 69-day window).

**Checklist:**

1. **Resolution criteria paraphrase**: Will Frontier Group Holdings or Frontier Airlines file Ch. 7 or Ch. 11 bankruptcy in U.S. court between Feb 22, 2026 and May 1, 2026? ✓

2. **Outside view base rate**: 0.5% (3% annual ULCC peer rate × 0.19 year window). Final prediction of 0.3% is rooted to this, adjusted downward for superior liquidity vs. reference class. ✓

3. **Consistency check**: "0.3 out of 100 times, Frontier files for bankruptcy before May 1, 2026." This is consistent with a company that has $874M liquidity, a CEO denying bankruptcy on record, and a clean 10-K filed 4 days ago. ✓

4. **Most significant evidence**:
   - CEO Dempsey: bankruptcy rumors "categorically untrue" (Reuters, Feb 19, 2026) ✓
   - 10-K filed Feb 2026, no going-concern language ✓
   - $874M liquidity, revolver expanded Dec 2025, no near-term maturities ✓
   - JP Morgan Baker: "deeply negative margins second only to Spirit" (moderate concern) ✓
   - 69-day window severely limits time for crisis to develop ✓

5. **Blind-spot**: A hidden covenant breach or undisclosed liability that triggers an acceleration event, forcing a filing within weeks. This scenario would shift probability to perhaps 2-3%, but there is no evidence of it.

6. **Status quo**: Frontier is currently operating normally, filing SEC reports, and executing a cost-cutting plan. The status quo strongly favors No resolution. ✓

Probability: 0.3%
