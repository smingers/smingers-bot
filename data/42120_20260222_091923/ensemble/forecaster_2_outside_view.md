Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

1. **AlphaQuery (ULCC Long-Term Debt Data):** Financial data aggregator showing Q4 2025 balance sheet data. Shows $357M formal long-term debt, total assets ~$6.26-7.22B, total liabilities ~$6.73B. Mixed cash flow signals. Moderate quality — raw data without context, but aligns with other sources.

2. **Frontier Communications Q2 2025 (investor.frontier.com):** Irrelevant — this is Frontier Communications (FYBR), not Frontier Airlines (ULCC). Zero relevance to the question.

3. **AZCentral/Spirit Airlines (August 2025):** Covers Spirit's second bankruptcy filing and going-concern language. Provides useful peer context — Spirit's distress was explicit and documented. No information about Frontier Airlines specifically.

4. **Post and Courier/Reuters (January 26, 2026):** Reports Frontier's November 2025 bid to acquire Spirit was "deemed unviable." This is a recent, credible source (Reuters-backed). Key insight: Frontier was attempting to *acquire* a competitor as recently as November 2025, which is inconsistent with a company in acute financial distress. The bid being rejected as unviable reflects on Spirit's complexity, not Frontier's financial health.

5. **The Points Guy (October 2025):** Spirit Airlines consumer guide. Confirms Spirit's second Chapter 11 filing August 29, 2025. No Frontier-specific information.

6. **Agent Report (comprehensive Frontier financial analysis):** High-quality synthesis drawing from PR Newswire earnings release (February 11, 2026) and StockTitan 10-K (February 18, 2026). Key facts: $874M total liquidity, $52M Q4 2025 pre-tax profit, no going-concern language, revolving credit expanded, 69 aircraft deliveries deferred to 2031-2033, Q1 2026 RASM trending >10% higher YoY. This is the most directly relevant and recent source. Credibility is high as it references official SEC filings and earnings releases.

7. **FRED Jet Fuel Data:** Annual data showing 2025 jet fuel at $2.11/gallon, down 9.6% YoY. Favorable for airline operating costs. Frontier's Q4 2025 fuel cost was $2.44/gallon (consistent). Declining fuel prices reduce operating cost pressure.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes are relevant:

- **U.S. airlines filing bankruptcy within 2-3 months of reporting $874M liquidity with no going-concern language:** Essentially zero historical precedent. Airlines typically show months of distress signals before filing.

- **U.S. publicly traded airlines filing bankruptcy within any given 2-month window:** Historically rare. Major airline bankruptcies (United 2002, Delta 2005, American 2011, Spirit 2024) were preceded by months of visible distress signals, covenant violations, going-concern language, and/or failed financing attempts.

- **ULCCs specifically filing bankruptcy:** Spirit is the most recent example, with explicit going-concern language and multiple failed financing rounds before filing. Frontier shows none of these precursors.

- **Companies with $800M+ liquidity filing bankruptcy within 2 months:** Extremely rare — typically only occurs with sudden catastrophic events (fraud, massive tort liability, sudden demand collapse). No such event is evident.

The most suitable reference class is: "U.S. airlines with $800M+ liquidity, no going-concern language, expanding credit facilities, and recent profitability filing for bankruptcy within 2 months." Historical rate: effectively 0%.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The question window is approximately **68 days** (February 22 to May 1, 2026). This is a very short window. Even companies in genuine financial distress typically take months to exhaust liquidity and exhaust alternatives before filing. Frontier's $874M liquidity buffer at $2.44/gallon fuel costs and ~$1B quarterly revenue means even a severe revenue shock would take many months to deplete cash reserves to crisis levels.

Historical patterns: Airlines that filed bankruptcy (Spirit, American, Delta, United) all showed distress signals for 6-12+ months before filing. Frontier shows the opposite trajectory — improving RASM, expanding credit, proactive fleet restructuring.

**(d) Justification**

The evidence strongly points away from bankruptcy risk before May 1, 2026:

1. **$874M liquidity** is a substantial buffer — roughly 22% of annual revenue
2. **No going-concern language** in the FY2025 10-K (filed February 18, 2026, just 4 days ago)
3. **Credit facility expanded** in December 2025 — lenders are supportive
4. **Q4 2025 profitable** ($52M pre-tax) — operational improvement underway
5. **Q1 2026 RASM >10% higher YoY** — revenue environment improving
6. **Proactive fleet restructuring** (69 aircraft deferred, 24 returns) reduces future obligations
7. **Frontier attempted to acquire Spirit** as recently as November 2025 — acquirers don't file bankruptcy 3-6 months later
8. **Declining jet fuel prices** reduce cost pressure
9. **No disclosed covenant violations**

The only realistic path to bankruptcy before May 1, 2026 would require a sudden, catastrophic, multi-factor shock: simultaneous demand collapse, fuel price spike, credit facility withdrawal, and covenant breach — all within 68 days. This is a genuine tail risk but extremely unlikely given current conditions.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate for a company with Frontier's financial profile (strong liquidity, no going-concern language, recent profitability, expanding credit) filing for bankruptcy within 2 months is approximately 0.5-2%. The agent report's estimate of 3-6% may be slightly high given the strength of the positive indicators. 

Tethering to the agent report's 3-5% estimate as a starting point, I would adjust downward given:
- The 10-K was filed just 4 days ago with no distress signals
- The credit facility expansion is a strong lender-confidence signal
- The Q1 2026 RASM improvement suggests the business is strengthening
- The very short 68-day window

However, I maintain a small residual probability for:
- Unknown off-balance-sheet risks
- Sudden macroeconomic shock
- Model uncertainty about sources

Outside View Prediction: 2.5%
