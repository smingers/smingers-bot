Analysis:
**1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)**  
This resolves **Yes** if Frontier Group Holdings (ULCC) or Frontier Airlines files **Chapter 7 or Chapter 11** in a **U.S. bankruptcy court** between **Feb 22, 2026 and May 1, 2026** (confirmed by PACER or SEC 8‑K).

## (a) Source analysis (what each says, quality, date)
1) **Intellectia.ai (Feb 2026)** — Secondary summary of management comments and earnings context (conference remarks). Claims: Q4 beat expectations; CEO expects >10% revenue increase in Q1; non-binding AerCap early return of 24 A320neo with “no liquidity penalty”; targets $200M cost savings by 2027. **Quality: medium** (secondary aggregator), but directionally consistent with other reporting.

2) **Simply Wall St (Feb 8, 2026)** — Commentary/valuation piece. Notes bearish research flags: losses, cash burn, liquidity concerns; also notes strong recent stock rebound. **Quality: low-to-medium** (mostly opinion/derivative), useful as a “market narrative” indicator, not decisive.

3) **StockTitan summary of ULCC 10‑K (filed Feb 2026 for FY ending Dec 31, 2025)** — Confirms normal SEC reporting; extracted portion doesn’t show going-concern language (but extraction incomplete). **Quality: medium-high** for the fact of filing; **low** for solvency inference because the key sections weren’t captured.

4) **Reuters via Investing.com (published Feb 19, 2026)** — High-quality journalism. Frontier CEO calls bankruptcy rumors “categorically untrue”; outlines cost cuts and fleet right-sizing; notes operational issues and skeptical analyst commentary (JP Morgan’s Jamie Baker calling margins extremely poor). **Quality: high**; contains both facts (performance metrics cited) and clearly attributed opinions (analyst skepticism).

5) **Reuters via Post and Courier (Jan 26, 2026)** — High-quality. Frontier’s prior bid for bankrupt Spirit deemed “unviable.” Mostly about Spirit; mild inference Frontier is still strategizing, not imminently insolvent. **Quality: high** but **indirect** for Frontier bankruptcy risk.

6) **Airline Weekly teaser (date not specified, paywalled/incomplete)** — Suggests “cautiously optimistic” framing of a turnaround. **Quality: low** (incomplete).

7) **The Points Guy (Oct 2025) + Bloomberg/Benzinga/MarketScreener (Dec 2025) about Spirit** — Sector context (ULCC stress; Spirit bankrupt; merger chatter). **Quality: medium** for sector context, **not direct** for Frontier filing probability in this short window.

8) **AskNews articles about trucking, NJ layoffs, South Korea bankruptcies, Frontier REIT, Dele Alli, etc. (Feb 2026)** — **Irrelevant** to Frontier Airlines bankruptcy criteria (name collisions like “Frontier” in other companies).

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
**Strong evidence (pushes probability down):**
- **Short horizon (68 days)** plus **continued normal operations and disclosures** (10‑K filed in Feb 2026) makes a sudden Ch. 11 filing less likely absent a shock.
- **Management actions consistent with liquidity management, not last-resort distress**: aircraft return agreement stated as having **no liquidity penalty** (Intellectia), cost-savings program (Reuters).

**Moderate evidence (mixed; slight up/down adjustments):**
- **Reuters Feb 19**: CEO denial is not proof, but the article also reports specific operational/financial metrics and an active plan (right-sizing, cost cuts). Net effect: **slightly down** vs bankruptcy rumors.
- **Analyst skepticism (JP Morgan via Reuters)** about “deeply negative margins” is a **moderate** negative signal: persistent bad margins can force restructuring *eventually*, but translating that into a **filing within 68 days** is a stretch unless liquidity/covenants are near the edge (not evidenced here).

**Weak evidence (small adjustments):**
- **Simply Wall St** “liquidity concerns” and valuation claims: mostly narrative/derivative; **small upward nudge** for risk perception, but not resolution-grade.
- **Spirit/ULCC sector stress**: indicates harsh competitive environment; **small upward nudge** (contagion/price pressure), but Frontier ≠ Spirit and timing is tight.

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left: **~68 days** (from Feb 22, 2026 to May 1, 2026).
- If the timeframe were **halved (~34 days)**: bankruptcy probability would drop meaningfully (many bankruptcies require weeks/months of lender/legal prep), perhaps to ~**2%**.  
- If the timeframe were **doubled (~136 days)**: more time for adverse quarters, covenant issues, or failed financing; probability could rise to ~**5–8%**, depending on liquidity trajectory and demand/fuel shocks.

## (d) Justification (updating from outside view)
**Outside-view base rate (given): 2.5%** for a filing within this very short window, given recent reporting/operations and no direct distress trigger.

**Inside-view adjustments:**
- **Downward forces:**  
  - Multiple sources indicate **active fleet/liquidity management** (AerCap returns, cost cuts) and **forward-looking revenue improvement commentary** (Intellectia; Reuters cites improved RASM).  
  - No direct evidence in the provided material of imminent triggers that usually precede airline bankruptcies inside 2 months (e.g., missed payments, covenant breaches, failed going-concern disclosure, emergency DIP negotiation leaks).
- **Upward forces:**  
  - Reuters highlights **very poor margins** relative to peers (analyst quote) and operational underperformance (on-time rank), which increases medium-term restructuring risk.  
  - Simply Wall St reiterates “liquidity concerns” as part of the prevailing bearish thesis.

Net: The new information is **mostly consistent with “not imminently filing,”** but the margin commentary and sector pressure keep a non-trivial tail risk. I therefore **nudge up slightly** from 2.5% to reflect credible skepticism, while keeping the probability low given the short window and lack of direct pre-bankruptcy indicators.

Probability calibration:
- Status quo (no shock; continued cost actions; no sudden liquidity cliff): implies **No**.
- Key “Yes” pathways within 68 days: abrupt liquidity event (credit withdrawal/covenant trip), sudden demand shock, fuel spike + operational disruption, or a pre-planned strategic filing already in motion (no evidence presented).
- I land at **3%**: low, but not near-zero because airlines can deteriorate quickly if liquidity is tighter than public signals imply.

Checklist:
1) Criteria: ULCC/Frontier Airlines files Ch. 7/11 in U.S. court **Feb 22–May 1, 2026**.  
2) Outside view base rate: **2.5%**.  
3) Consistency line: **3 out of 100 times, Frontier files Chapter 7/11 before May 1, 2026.**  
4) Key evidence (most significant):
   - Short 68-day window + ongoing SEC reporting/operations (10‑K filing).  
   - Reuters: CEO denies bankruptcy rumors; company pursuing cost cuts/fleet right-sizing.  
   - Intellectia: AerCap aircraft return deal stated “no liquidity penalty” + Q1 revenue growth expectation.  
   - Reuters/JP Morgan analyst: margins extremely poor (raises tail risk).  
5) Blind spot: **Undisclosed near-term covenant/liquidity crunch** (e.g., revolver conditions, lessor demands) forcing a rapid filing; would push probability toward **10%+**.  
6) Status quo: airlines usually don’t jump to bankruptcy in <2–3 months without obvious precursors; slight pull toward **No** is warranted.

Probability: 3%
