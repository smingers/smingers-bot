Analysis:
a) Source analysis (quality, factual takeaways, opinions)
1. Intellectia.ai (22 Feb 2026): Earnings summary from Q4-2025/Q1-2026 investor call. Reliable – direct quotes from CEO, SEC-filed figures. Shows liquidity still adequate, revenue above expectations, no distress signal. CEO opinion (“no liquidity penalty”) is identifiable and first-hand.
2. Simply Wall St (8 Feb 2026): Retail-investor site that crunches public data. Medium quality. Flags cash-burn & valuation concerns but offers no new facts. Forward-looking commentary is anonymous and thus low evidentiary weight.
3. Frontier 10-K cover (filed 14 Feb 2026): Primary document, high quality. Confirms normal reporting cadence, no shell status. Going-concern language absent on cover page (full MD&A not provided).
4. Reuters/Post-and-Courier (26 Jan 2026): High-quality journalism. Reports Frontier’s bid for bankrupt Spirit deemed “unviable.” Provides industry stress context; no claim that Frontier itself is insolvent.
5. Reuters wire carried by Investing.com (19 Feb 2026): On-record interview with new CEO James Dempsey, who “categorically denies” bankruptcy rumours and details $200 m cost-saving plan. High quality for factual quotes; CEO denial is an opinion but from top decision-maker.
6. Airline Weekly teaser (Feb 2026): Pay-walled, partial. Only broad framing of “reinvention.” Low evidentiary value.
7. FRED Jet-Fuel price series (macro). Objective data, high quality; shows fuel costs lower YoY, easing cost pressure.
8. AskNews scrape lists many unrelated bankruptcies (trucking, real estate). Not pertinent to Frontier; excluded from weighting.

b) Evidence weighting
Strong:
• SEC 10-K filing on schedule with no disclosed going-concern warning.
• CEO statement + Q4 profit indicating near-term liquidity headroom (~$874 m cash per earnings PR).
Moderate:
• Sector stress: Spirit’s double bankruptcy & analysts noting “deeply negative margins” at Frontier signal structural pressure on ULCCs.
• Frontier share price down 44 % YoY – market perceives risk.
Weak:
• Anonymous bearish notes (Simply Wall St) and social-media rumours already denied.

Net evidence skews toward “No filing” inside the 68-day window.

c) Timeframe analysis
Resolution window ≈ 68 days (2.2 months). Typical pre-petition runway for a large airline after liquidity warnings is 3-9 months; none visible yet. If the window were doubled to 4.4 months, probability would rise modestly (to ~5 %); halved to 1.1 months, probability would fall (<2 %).

d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base rate (ULCC short-horizon): 2.37 %.
Downward adjustments
+ Healthy cash balance and recent profitable quarter (-0.8 pp).
+ No covenant breach or missed payments reported (-0.3 pp).
Upward adjustments
+ ULCC peer (Spirit) already in Chapter 11, showing sector fragility (+0.9 pp).
+ Frontier’s still-negative full-year margin guidance and stock rout (+0.4 pp).

Resulting point estimate ≈ 2.6 %. Rounded for clarity.

Probability calibration
I expect that about 3 times in 100 comparable situations an airline in Frontier’s current condition would file within the next 68 days. Uncertainty is substantial (σ ≈ 2 pp) but skewed low because filings are lumpy events.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Between 22 Feb 2026 and 30 Apr 2026, will Frontier Group (NASDAQ ULCC) or its airline arm voluntarily file Chapter 7/11?” ✔
2. Outside-view base: 2.37 %. ✔
3. Consistency: “3 out of 100 times, Frontier would file in this 68-day period.” ✔
4. Key evidence (top 4):
   • On-time 10-K, no going-concern flag.
   • $874 m liquidity & Q4 profit just reported.
   • CEO public denial of bankruptcy rumours.
   • Peer Spirit’s recent double Chapter 11 highlighting sector risk. ✔
5. Blind-spot: Sudden fuel-price spike or failed short-term refinancing (e.g., AerCap deal collapses) forcing an unexpected “free-fall” filing could raise odds substantially. ✔
6. Status-quo bias check: No imminent trigger known; nudging slightly toward “No” is prudent. ✔

Probability: 3%
