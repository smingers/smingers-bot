**Crafting a superforecaster response**

I need to analyze whether Frontier Group Holdings, Inc. will file for bankruptcy protection before May 1, 2026, with just 68 days left until the deadline. Starting from a base rate of 2.37%, I’ll integrate current insights, like the CEO denying rumors and recent financial performance data indicating good liquidity and cost-saving efforts. Though the sector faces stress, Frontier is not at immediate risk. I will summarize sources, weigh evidence, analyze the timeframe, and then provide a probability assessment.**Assessing bankruptcy probability**

I’m evaluating the likelihood of Frontier Group Holdings, Inc. filing for bankruptcy protection. While recent revenue trends show negative margins, there are some positive signals, like good liquidity and a recent profit. I’m thinking of adjusting the probability from the base rate of 2.37% to possibly 2.5% or even 3%. Despite sector uncertainties, the chance seems low, especially with the CEO's denial of rumors. I’ll summarize my analysis in terms of sources, evidence, timeframes, and justification. The final probability should be clearly stated as an integer.
