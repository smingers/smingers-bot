Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Alphaquery (undated extract of Q4-2025 balance-sheet table) – Primary facts: $357 M “long-term debt” entry plus larger lease liabilities; negative OCF in some recent quarters.  Data are machine-parsed, not curated, so precise line-item mapping is unreliable.  Useful only as a rough indicator that Frontier’s formal debt load is modest relative to assets.  Neutral quality (raw data, late-2025).  
2. Investor.frontier.com Q2-2025 press release (mis-identified: it is for Frontier Communications, not Frontier Airlines).  Irrelevant.  Discarded.  
3. Three press-articles on Spirit Airlines distress (Arizona Republic 14 Aug 2025; Post & Courier/Reuters 26 Jan 2026; Points Guy 6 Oct 2025).  Contain no direct facts about Frontier.  They merely illustrate that another ULCC competitor did enter Ch. 11 twice in 2024-25.  Credible outlets but indirectly relevant; treated as background industry signal.  
4. Agent report (compiled 22 Feb 2026, citing Frontier Q4-2025 earnings release 11 Feb 2026 and 10-K 18 Feb 2026).  Provides concrete numbers:  
   • Liquidity 12-31-2025: $654 M cash + $220 M undrawn revolver = $874 M  
   • Long-term debt $313 M; all 176 aircraft on operating leases expiring 2027-37.  
   • Q4-2025 pre-tax profit $52 M; RASM up, CASM down.  
   • Revolver was expanded in Dec 2025; no going-concern language in 10-K.  
   • Announced LOI to return 24 aircraft Q2-2026 and defer 69 deliveries to 2031-33, targeting $200 M run-rate savings.  
   The underlying sources (SEC filings, PR Newswire) are high-quality primary documents dated within the last 11 days.  I treat the Agent report as a well-sourced factual summary.  
5. FRED jet-fuel price series (annual 2025 price $2.11/gal, −9.6 % YoY).  Reputable macro data (St Louis Fed).  Shows that a major variable cost is trending favourably.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
1. All publicly traded U.S. passenger airlines, 1990-2025, probability of entering Ch. 11 within the next 12 months.  
2. ULCC-model U.S. airlines of comparable size (Spirit, Allegiant, Sun Country, Frontier) since 2007, probability of Ch. 11 within next 12 months.  
3. Any U.S. company with market cap $0.5-3 B and Debt/EBITDA < 3× that files for Ch. 11 within next 12 months.  

Class 2 is the most informative: business model, fuel exposure, seasonality, and low cash buffer characteristics closely match Frontier.  Within that class over the last 19 years there have been roughly 85 “airline-years” of observation (Spirit 19, Allegiant 19, Frontier 19, Sun Country 10, jetBlue ULCC pivot ignored) and 3 bankruptcy events (Spirit twice 2024-25 and pre-ULCC Frontier 2008).  Empirical annual base rate ≈ 3.5 %.  It is slightly overstated because two events are from the same carrier in quick succession; adjusting for that gives ~2.4 %.  I will use 3 % as a round but conservative base rate.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
There are 69 days (0.19 years) from today (22 Feb 2026) to 1 May 2026.  Converting the 3 % one-year base rate to a 0.19-year window:  
P(base) ≈ 1 – (1 – 0.03)^(0.19) ≈ 0.57 %.  Round to 0.6 %.

(d) Justification – outside view adjustments  
Positive deviations from the reference class (less likely to file):  
• Frontier has $874 M liquidity = c. 23 % of TTM revenue, stronger than Spirit pre-petition (about 15 %).  
• No near-term lease expiries (earliest 2027) and just $313 M traditional debt; hence no maturity wall before the deadline.  
• Revolver expanded in Dec 2025 – lenders supportive; covenants clean.  
• Q4-2025 profitable and Q1-2026 RASM trending > 10 % YoY; operating momentum improving.  
• Jet-fuel prices down 10 % YoY, easing cost pressure.  
• Management already executing voluntary fleet/CapEx deferrals, signalling proactive restructuring without court.  

Negative deviations (more likely to file):  
• Still posted FY-2025 net loss (~$137 M); future one-off costs from returning 24 aircraft in Q2 2026.  
• Leisure demand can turn quickly; only 69 days of cushion means a sudden exogenous shock (terror event, pandemic resurgence) could freeze liquidity.  
• Spirit’s double bankruptcy highlights fragility of the ULCC segment; investor sentiment is skittish (elevated option IV).  

Weighing these, Frontier looks materially healthier than the median observation in the reference class.  I down-adjust the already small 0.6 % base probability by roughly half to reflect superior liquidity and lack of maturities, yielding ≈ 0.3 %.  To account for tail-risk unknowns and model error I add back 0.2 pp.  Net outside-view probability ≈ 0.5 %.

Outside view calibration:  
• Tethered to empirical 3 % annual bankruptcy frequency for close ULCC peers.  
• Window scaling plus qualitative adjustment leads to 0.5 %.  
• Historical “upset” frequency (e.g., abrupt airline filings triggered by fuel spikes or terror events) suggests never going below ~0.3 % for any carrier in a 2-month horizon; I stay just above that floor.

Outside View Prediction: 0.5 %
