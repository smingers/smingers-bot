**Creating a baseline forecast**

I need to produce an outside view baseline forecast using historical bankruptcy rates for US airlines, especially ULCC carriers, considering there are about 2.2 months until May 1, 2026. The data suggests the company's financial health is good, so the probability of bankruptcy seems low. I’ll summarize and evaluate each source and use a reference class for my forecast.

For context, I should approximate the annual bankruptcy probability for similar carriers over the last 30 years. There’ve been approximately 35 bankruptcy filings among around 60 carriers each year. I'll also consider S&P default rates and Moody's data for further insight.**Calculating probability baseline**

I’m considering a baseline probability of around 1%, assuming an annual bankruptcy rate of about 5%. I need to compute this accurately. Additionally, I should factor in the possibility of sudden shocks that could impact the airline's financial stability. With that in mind, I’ll create a more detailed and thorough forecast to ensure it's well-rounded and considers various scenarios. Let’s craft the final output while keeping all these elements in mind!
