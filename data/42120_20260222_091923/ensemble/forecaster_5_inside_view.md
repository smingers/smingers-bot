Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological, most salient)

• Intellectia.ai earnings wrap-up (Feb 17 2026). Factual numbers taken from Frontier’s Q4-25 earnings call and 8-K. Primary data, high quality; no opinion beyond CEO’s standard optimism.  
• Reuters/Investing.com interview with new CEO Dempsey (Feb 19 2026). Identifiable journalist, direct CEO quotes flatly denying “bankruptcy chatter”. Moderate quality; management incentives bias toward optimism.  
• Simply Wall St valuation note (Feb 8 2026). Screens historical losses and liquidity worries; largely automated analysis, medium quality, mild bearish opinion not sourced to experts.  
• SEC Form 10-K FYE 2025 (filed 18 Feb 2026). Definitive primary source. Shows: unrestricted cash ≈ $874 m, total liquidity $1.15 b, no “going-concern” language, next significant debt maturity 2H 2027. Strong evidence.  
• Post & Courier (Jan 26 2026) and other Bloomberg/Reuters items on Spirit bankruptcy. Secondary context only; suggests ULCC stress. Medium quality, weak relevance to Frontier.  
• Airline Weekly teaser (Feb 2026). Pay-walled, limited facts; tone cautiously optimistic. Low informational value.  
• Mass-bankruptcy statistics (AskNews Feb 21 2026). Macro datapoint—bankruptcies rising in other industries. Weak link to an airline with >$1 b liquidity.  

2. Evidence analysis (relative weight)

Strong evidence  
• SEC 10-K liquidity position and absence of going-concern paragraph.  
• No near-term debt maturities or covenant triggers.

Moderate evidence  
• CEO public denial plus detailed plan to cut $200 m costs → suggests proactive management, but incentives acknowledged.  
• ULCC peer (Spirit) in repeat Chapter 11 → shows segment-level fragility.  
• Unit revenue improving 10 % YoY and jet-fuel prices –9 % YoY → supportive macro trend.

Weak evidence  
• Automated valuation article flagging “liquidity concerns” without new data.  
• General rise in U.S. corporate bankruptcies.  
• Frontier’s share-price volatility.

Net: strong opposing evidence (ample liquidity, filings clean) outweighs moderate/weak pressures toward distress over the next nine weeks.

3. Timeframe analysis

Window until resolution: 69 days (~0.19 yr). Bankruptcy cases for U.S. airlines rarely emerge in <90 days after a clean 10-K; even Spirit’s “surprise” second filing took 95 days. If the window were doubled (138 days) I’d raise the probability to ~3 %. Halved (~35 days) I’d cut to ~0.5 %.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view base rate (public U.S. airline, two-month horizon): 0.6 %.  
Upward adjustments  
+0.3 pp ULCC sector stress (Spirit, negative margins).  
+0.2 pp Frontier FY-25 net loss, aircraft return costs.  
Downward adjustments  
–0.4 pp $1.15 b liquidity and no maturities before 2027.  
–0.2 pp positive Q1-26 RASM + fuel relief.  
–0.1 pp explicit “categorically untrue” bankruptcy statement (small weight).  
Result ≈ 0.4 %. Apply ×1.5 multiplicative uncertainty buffer → 0.6 %.  
Add 0.4 % cushion for tail-risk shocks (terror event, fuel spike, grounding) → 1.0 %.

Probability calibration

My best estimate: roughly one time in 100 a Chapter 11 would be filed by Frontier before 1 May 2026.

Checklist:

1. Paraphrase: “Between today (22 Feb 2026) and 1 May 2026, will Frontier Group Holdings/Frontier Airlines file Chapter 7 or 11?”  
2. Outside-view base rate used: 0.6 %.  
3. Consistency line: “About 1 out of 100 times, Frontier would file within the next 69 days.”  
4. Key evidence (20 wds each):  
   – SEC 10-K shows $1.15 b liquidity, no going-concern.  
   – No significant debt/lease maturities until 2027.  
   – CEO denies bankruptcy, unveils $200 m cost-cut plan.  
   – Spirit’s repeat bankruptcy highlights ULCC pressure.  
   – Q1-26 RASM +10 %, jet fuel –9 % YoY.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden grounding of A320neo fleet after safety issue forcing mass cash burn could spike probability to ~10 %.  
6. Status-quo: continuing to trade with ample cash and executing cost reductions → No-filing outcome.

Probability: 1%
