Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. AlphaQuery long-term debt table (Dec-2025 data). Factual balance-sheet numbers but the layout is partly garbled and unlabeled; useful only as a rough cross-check. Date: Feb 2026 retrieval. Quality: medium.  
2. Investor.Frontier.com article (actually Frontier COMMUNICATIONS). Wrong company; ignore for factual content.  
3. Arizona Republic, Post & Courier, Points Guy articles – all about Spirit Airlines. Factual for Spirit but not Frontier; at best they supply general industry context that ULCCs can and do fail. Quality for Frontier forecast: low.  
4. Agent_report (22 Feb 2026). Synthesises Frontier’s Q4-25 earnings release (PR Newswire 11 Feb 2026) and FY-25 10-K (18 Feb 2026). Gives concrete numbers for cash, debt, lease maturities, absence of going-concern language, and outlines announced fleet restructuring. These filings are primary sources; the synthesis is credible. Quality: high.  
5. FRED jet-fuel price series. Objective macro data; shows fuel at $2.11/gal, down 9 % YoY. Quality: high.

All opinions we lean on come either from Frontier’s management (potentially biased but legally constrained) or from observable lender behaviour (expanded revolver), which is an implicit expert signal.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Possible classes:  
1. All publicly traded U.S. airlines, 2000-2025.  
2. Ultra-low-cost carriers (ULCCs) only.  
3. All NYSE/Nasdaq firms with market cap $0.5–5 B and net losses in the prior year.  

Class 1 is broad and well-documented, giving enough bankruptcy events to compute a frequency. Class 2 is attractive conceptually but has very few firms (Spirit, Allegiant, Sun Country, Frontier) so the base rate is too noisy. Class 3 dilutes industry-specific risks. I choose Class 1 (public U.S. airlines) as the primary reference class and then adjust.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
The question window is now 69 days (22 Feb → 1 May 2026). In the reference class 25 calendar years × ~12 publicly traded airlines ≈ 300 carrier-years. Roughly 10 Chapter 11 filings occurred (United 2002, US Air 2002, Delta 2005, Northwest 2005, American 2011, Frontier 2008 when private, Sun Country 2008, Spirit 2024+2025 etc.). That is ≈3.3 % per carrier-year. Over 69 days (0.19 yr) the unconditional chance is 3.3 % × 0.19 ≈ 0.6 %.

Historical pattern: filings usually follow quarters of sustained cash burn; they are rarely sprung within two months of an apparently adequate liquidity report, because airlines can and do operate for months while technically insolvent. The shortest publicly traded airline “surprise” was Spirit’s second filing, 95 days after a “going-concern” 10-Q. That suggests very low frequencies on a <3-month horizon.

(d) Justification  
Base rate from the reference class for a random U.S. airline over a two-month span ≈ 0.6 %. Adjustments:

Upward pressures  
• ULCC segment stress (Spirit’s back-to-back bankruptcies) → +0.8 pp  
• Frontier posted an FY-25 net loss → +0.5 pp  
• One-time Q1-26 costs to return 24 aircraft → +0.2 pp  

Downward pressures  
• $874 M liquidity (23 % of TTM revenue) and expanding revolver → –0.8 pp  
• No lease expirations until 2027, no going-concern language → –0.7 pp  
• Q4-25 profit and Q1-26 RASM +10 % YoY; fuel prices –10 % YoY → –0.4 pp  

Net upward adjustment: (+1.5) – (1.9) = –0.4 pp. Apply to 0.6 % base gives ≈0.2 %. Recognising model uncertainty and fat tails, I widen it three-fold (superforecaster style, multiplicative uncertainty factor of ~3) to avoid over-confidence: 0.2 % × 3 ≈ 0.6 %.

Outside view calibration:

• Closest tethered figure: 3.3 % per carrier-year bankruptcy frequency (Class 1).  
• Unexpected outcomes do happen (e.g., COVID-19 2020) but require a large exogenous shock. Over a 69-day window that risk is small yet non-zero.  
• Options-implied volatility for ULCC (~70 % annualised) hints at tail risk but still converts to single-digit default probabilities over two months.  
• Historical “upset” rate in airline bankruptcy forecasting (firms thought solvent filing within 3 months) is rare, perhaps 1 in 200. This supports a sub-1 % estimate.

Outside View Prediction:
0.7 %
