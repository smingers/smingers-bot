**Evaluating bankruptcy probabilities**

I'm aiming to create a thorough analysis, focusing on outside view predictions as a superforecaster. I'll assess various sources, including The Agent report, to understand bankruptcy filing probabilities for US airlines and ULCCs over the next 2.2 months, specifically looking at historical data. Given the rare nature of such filings, I might estimate a 5% to 6% probability based on base rates rather than company-specific insights. This should provide a clear outside view based on historical averages.**Constructing bankruptcy analysis**

I'm planning to create a detailed analysis, starting with a summary of source materials and reference classes, focusing on publicly traded US airlines. I want to look at a 69-day timeframe and justify my points. Historically, from 2000 to 2025, there have been about 10 bankruptcies among major and regional airlines. 

When calculating the probability, I find that the annual chance per airline is around 3.3%. Considering financial stress factors, I might adjust this to around 4%. That's still relatively low, but I'm prepared to elaborate on these details in my final draft.
