## Summary: Spirit Airlines Shutdown Risk (Arizona Republic)

**Core Development:** Spirit Airlines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in **November 2024**, emerged from bankruptcy, and subsequently rebranded as a premium carrier targeting more affluent travelers. However, on **August 11, 2025**, Spirit filed an SEC disclosure expressing serious doubts about its financial viability.

### Key Facts:
- Spirit's SEC filing stated: *"Management has concluded there is substantial doubt as to (Spirit)'s ability to continue as a going concern within 12 months from the date these financial statements are issued."*
- The airline cited **weak leisure travel demand** during spring and early summer 2025, combined with an elevated number of available seats creating a "challenging pricing environment"
- Spirit **furloughed 270 pilots** as part of cost-cutting measures
- The airline introduced a **premium economy fare class** as part of its rebranding strategy
- Potential future measures include **selling aircraft, real estate, and excess airport gate capacity**

### Context:
- Spirit is an ultra-low-cost carrier (ULCC) based in Dania Beach, Florida
- The article focuses primarily on Spirit Airlines' financial distress and its potential impact on Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport

**Relevance Note:** This article is about **Spirit Airlines**, not Frontier Group Holdings/Frontier Airlines. It provides no direct information about Frontier's financial condition, though both operate as ultra-low-cost carriers in a similar market environment.

## Summary: Investor Enters Talks to Buy Bankrupt Spirit; Frontier Bid Deemed Unviable

**Source:** Post and Courier (via Reuters), January 26, 2026

### Key Facts:

- Investment firm **Castlelake** has entered talks to potentially acquire **Spirit Airlines**, which is currently in its **second bankruptcy filing** in less than a year (proceedings began in August).
- A **November offer from Frontier Group Holdings** to acquire Spirit was **deemed unviable**, according to four people familiar with the matter.
- Spirit secured a **$100 million emergency financing lifeline in December** from creditors to support operations and restructuring.
- Spirit dramatically shrank its operations, cutting nearly **100 aircraft** from its fleet in October and exiting more than a dozen U.S. markets while suspending ~40 routes.

### Named Source Opinions:
- **Marshall Huebner** (Davis Polk & Wardwell, representing Spirit): Described Spirit as "substantially reenvisioned and almost completely reinvented," calling it "smaller, tighter, better" at a Jan. 21 bankruptcy court hearing.
- **Air Line Pilots Association (ALPA):** In a Jan. 13 letter, publicly pressured bondholders to release further financing to avoid liquidation, warning bondholders could "force a liquidation that would destroy South Florida's hometown airline."
- **Spirit CFO Fred Cromer:** Cited excess capacity, tepid leisure travel demand, and fare pressure from legacy carriers as key factors undermining Spirit's turnaround.

### Relevance to Frontier:
The article confirms Frontier's bid for Spirit was rejected as unviable but contains **no indication that Frontier itself faces financial distress or bankruptcy risk**.

# Frontier Group Holdings (ULCC) – Comprehensive Financial Health & Bankruptcy Risk Assessment
## Updated Through Q4 2025 / February 2026

---

## Executive Summary

New search results, including Frontier's official Q4 2025 earnings release (PR Newswire, February 11, 2026) and the FY2025 10-K filing (StockTitan, February 18, 2026), materially update and improve upon the prior analysis. The updated picture is meaningfully more positive than earlier data suggested: Frontier ended 2025 with **$874 million in total liquidity**, posted a **profitable Q4 2025** ($52M pre-tax income, 5.2% margin), and is executing a significant fleet restructuring that targets **$200 million in annual run-rate cost savings by 2027**. No going-concern language has been identified. The probability of a bankruptcy filing before May 1, 2026 is assessed as **very low — approximately 3–6%**.

---

## 1. Cash & Liquidity Position (Most Recent: December 31, 2025)

**From the official Q4 2025 earnings release (PR Newswire, February 11, 2026):**
- Unrestricted cash and cash equivalents: **$654 million**
- Revolving credit facility availability: **$220 million** (expanded by $15 million in December 2025)
- **Total liquidity: $874 million** (~23% of trailing twelve-month revenue)

This compares favorably to the Q2 2025 snapshot (Airways Magazine):
- Q2 2025 total liquidity: **$766 million** ($561M cash + $205M revolving credit)

The sequential improvement from $766M (Q2 2025) to $874M (Q4 2025) demonstrates that Frontier's liquidity position **strengthened through the second half of 2025**, driven by Q4 profitability and the revolving credit facility expansion. The credit facility expansion — even by a modest $15 million — signals that lenders remain willing to extend credit, a meaningful positive indicator.

**Peer comparison:** Spirit Airlines, which filed for Chapter 11 in November 2024 and refiled in August 2025, had $646.6 million in cash liquidity at the time of its second filing (Simple Flying, November 11, 2025) but faced $6.7 billion in total liabilities and explicit going-concern language. Frontier's position is structurally superior.

---

## 2. Total Debt & Capital Structure

- **Fleet financing:** All 176 Airbus single-aisle aircraft are financed through **operating leases expiring between 2027 and 2037** (PR Newswire, February 11, 2026) — a critical update from the prior analysis which cited 2025–2036 expiry. The updated range (2027–2037) means **no lease expirations in 2025 or 2026**, removing a near-term cash pressure point.
- **Formal long-term debt:** $313 million (FY2025, StockTitan 10-K)
- **Revolving credit facility:** $220 million available; expanded in December 2025 with no other contractual changes
- **Debt-to-equity ratio:** 0.64 (FY2025)
- **Total assets:** $7.2 billion (FY2025)

The lease structure is critical: Frontier's formal debt is modest, but operating lease obligations represent fixed cash commitments. The updated lease expiry window (2027–2037) provides a meaningful buffer — no forced aircraft returns or lease renegotiations are imminent within the bankruptcy risk window (before May 1, 2026).

---

## 3. Operating Performance & Cash Flow

**Q4 2025 (PR Newswire, February 11, 2026):**
- Total operating revenue: **$997 million** (consistent with Q4 2024)
- Total operating expenses: **$948 million** (including $227M fuel at $2.44/gallon)
- Pre-tax income: **$52 million** (5.2% margin)
- Net income: **$53 million** ($0.23 per diluted share)
- RASM: 10.17 cents (stage-adjusted to 1,000 miles: 9.61 cents)
- Load factor: 79% (up slightly YoY)
- CASM: 9.67 cents (vs. 9.78 cents in Q4 2024 — improving)
- Adjusted CASM ex-fuel: 7.36 cents (1% lower than Q4 2024)

**Q2 2025 (Airways Magazine):**
- Revenue: $929 million (-5% YoY)
- Net loss: $70 million (-$0.31 EPS)
- Total liquidity: $766 million

**Full Year 2025:**
- Adjusted CASM + net interest: 9.70 cents (stage-adjusted: 9.30 cents)
- Cost advantage vs. industry average: **>40%** — Frontier maintains its structural ULCC cost advantage
- Q4 2025 was profitable despite a U.S. government shutdown and FAA flight reduction directive that cost approximately $30 million in revenue

The pattern is clear: Frontier lost money in Q1–Q3 2025 (consistent with prior analysis showing FY2025 net loss of ~$137M) but returned to profitability in Q4 2025, mirroring the Q4 2024 pattern. Seasonal profitability in Q4 is a recurring feature of Frontier's business model.

---

## 4. Covenant Status & Liquidity Facilities

- **No going-concern language** has been identified in any available SEC filing, earnings release, or third-party analysis
- **No disclosed covenant violations** in any available source
- The revolving credit facility was **expanded** in December 2025 (from $205M to $220M), which is inconsistent with a company in covenant distress — lenders do not typically expand facilities for borrowers in breach
- The 10-K for FY2025 was filed February 18, 2026 (StockTitan) without apparent distress signals in available metadata
- The auditor's report (required under SOX 404(b) as an accelerated filer) was completed without qualification flags visible in available data

**Contrast with Spirit Airlines:** Spirit's SEC filings explicitly used "substantial doubt about the Company's ability to continue as a going concern" language (Simple Flying, November 11, 2025). No equivalent language exists for Frontier.

---

## 5. Forthcoming Maturities & Fleet Restructuring

**Key strategic actions announced in early February 2026 (PR Newswire):**

1. **AerCap lease termination agreement (non-binding LOI):** Frontier reached a letter of intent to terminate leases on **24 aircraft** currently in operation, with returns expected in **Q2 2026**. AerCap will commit to 10 future sale-leaseback transactions for 2028–2029 deliveries.

2. **Airbus delivery deferral (non-binding framework):** Frontier reached a framework agreement with Airbus to defer **69 A320neo family aircraft** originally scheduled for delivery 2027–2030, rescheduled to **2031–2033**. This dramatically reduces near-term capital commitment obligations.

3. **Financial impact:** These fleet modifications, combined with other cost savings, are targeted to generate **~$200 million in annual run-rate cost savings by 2027**.

4. **Definitive documents** expected to be finalized by Q1 2026, with one-time expenses associated with the lease termination.

These actions represent a proactive, creditor-friendly restructuring of obligations — the opposite of a company heading toward bankruptcy. Deferring 69 aircraft deliveries removes billions in future capital commitments and reduces pre-delivery deposit obligations.

**Lease maturities:** Updated to 2027–2037 (no 2025 or 2026 expirations), eliminating near-term forced cash outflows from lease returns.

---

## 6. Forward Guidance (Q1 and Full Year 2026)

From the Q4 2025 earnings release (PR Newswire, February 11, 2026):
- **Q1 2026 RASM** (stage-adjusted): trending **>10% higher** than Q1 2025 — a strong demand signal
- Supply-demand environment described as "more constructive"
- Full-year 2026 guidance reflects expectation of profitability return
- Four strategic priorities: fleet rightsizing, cost discipline, operational reliability improvement, loyalty maturation
- CEO Jimmy Dempsey (who replaced Barry Biffle) expressed confidence in the 2026 trajectory

The >10% RASM improvement in Q1 2026 vs. Q1 2025 is particularly significant — Q1 is typically the weakest quarter for ULCCs, and strong RASM growth suggests the revenue environment is improving materially.

---

## 7. Peer Comparison

| Metric | Frontier (Dec 2025) | Spirit (at 2nd filing, Aug 2025) |
|--------|--------------------|---------------------------------|
| Total Liquidity | $874M | $646.6M cash |
| Total Liabilities | ~$X (lease-heavy) | $6.7 billion |
| Going Concern | **None** | **Explicit** |
| Covenant Issues | None disclosed | Active minimum liquidity covenant concerns |
| Lease Expirations | 2027–2037 | Immediate pressures |
| Profitability (Q4) | +$52M pre-tax | Deep losses |
| Credit Facility | Expanded Dec 2025 | Fully drawn, at risk |

Frontier's financial profile is categorically different from Spirit's at the time of Spirit's bankruptcy filings. The structural differences — no near-term lease expirations, no going-concern language, expanding credit facility, returning to profitability — place Frontier in a fundamentally different risk category.

---

## 8. Bankruptcy Risk Assessment — Updated

**Factors strongly reducing bankruptcy risk before May 1, 2026:**
- $874M total liquidity as of December 31, 2025 (23% of TTM revenue)
- Revolving credit facility expanded in December 2025 — lenders remain supportive
- No going-concern language in FY2025 10-K or any SEC filing
- No disclosed covenant violations
- Q4 2025 profitable ($52M pre-tax) — second consecutive Q4 profit
- Q1 2026 RASM trending >10% higher YoY — improving revenue environment
- Lease expirations now 2027–2037 — no near-term forced returns
- 69 aircraft deliveries deferred to 2031–2033 — capital obligations dramatically reduced
- AerCap partnership on fleet restructuring signals lessor confidence
- $200M targeted annual cost savings by 2027 — credible restructuring plan
- 40%+ cost advantage vs. industry average maintained

**Residual risk factors:**
- Full-year 2025 was loss-making (net loss ~$137M)
- One-time expenses from lease termination agreement (Q1 2026) will impact near-term results
- Government shutdown and FAA directives created ~$30M revenue headwind in Q4 2025
- Macroeconomic uncertainty (tariffs, consumer spending) could pressure leisure demand
- Fleet rightsizing (returning 24 aircraft in Q2 2026) creates operational transition risk
- High implied volatility in options market reflects residual uncertainty

**Probability Assessment:** The probability of Frontier Group Holdings filing for bankruptcy before May 1, 2026 is estimated at approximately **3–5%**. This is a tail risk scenario requiring a sudden, severe liquidity shock (e.g., simultaneous covenant breach, credit facility withdrawal, and demand collapse) within a very short timeframe. The base case — supported by $874M liquidity, no going-concern language, expanding credit facility, Q4 profitability, and proactive fleet restructuring — is continued operations with a path toward full-year profitability in 2026.</Agent_report>
