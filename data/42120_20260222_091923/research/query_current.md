Analysis:
To assess the likelihood that Frontier Group Holdings (parent of Frontier Airlines) will seek Chapter 11 protection before May 1 2026, I need the newest evidence of financial stress or explicit bankruptcy planning.  Key signals include:  
• Recent quarterly results, cash-burn, liquidity runway, covenant breaches, or looming debt maturities.  
• Credit-rating downgrades, distressed-debt trading levels, or warnings from analysts.  
• Management comments or SEC filings about “going-concern” risk or “strategic alternatives.”  
• News of hiring restructuring advisers, negotiating with lessors, or mass schedule cuts.  
• Comparisons to other U.S. ULCCs and the health of the domestic airline market in early 2026.

Therefore the searches should surface: late-2025/early-2026 earnings releases, SEC 8-Ks/10-Qs, analyst notes, credit-rating actions, and industry news about Frontier’s financial position and any chatter about bankruptcy.
