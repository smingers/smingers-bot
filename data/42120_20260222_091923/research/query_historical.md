Analysis:
To gauge Frontier’s bankruptcy risk, the key historical context is its present financial condition: leverage, cash burn, liquidity runway, upcoming debt maturities, and any “going-concern” language in recent SEC filings. Important background items include 2024–2025 earnings releases, balance-sheet figures, credit-rating actions, and press coverage discussing strategic challenges (capacity growth, fare pressure, fuel costs). Locating these will help establish an outside view of how close Frontier already is to distress and how the broader airline environment is affecting it.
