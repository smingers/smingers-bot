Newkirk Logistics Inc., based in Dallas, filed a Subchapter V Chapter 11 petition on February 4, 2026, listing $1 million to $10 million in assets and liabilities; it operates 83 trucks and 94 drivers, providing interstate general freight and U.S. mail services, including contracts with DHL eCommerce. Bee & G Enterprises LLC, a small intermodal and drayage carrier based in Tacoma, Washington, filed for Chapter 11 on February 14, operating seven trucks and six drivers, with its broker authority revoked. Mast Trucking Inc., a Kansas-based company, filed on February 10, listing $1 million to $10 million in assets and liabilities, operating 55 trucks and 56 drivers; its largest creditors include the U.S. Small Business Administration ($2 million), Commercial Credit Group Inc. ($1+ million), and Volvo Car Financial Services ($540,000+). The company hauls general freight, building materials, grain, feed, hay, and blood plasma. The downturn, labeled the 'Great Freight Recession' by industry experts, stems from declining shipping demand, lower freight rates, and rising labor, fuel, and insurance costs since 2022. Long-haul truckload demand fell 25% in the first half of 2025, according to FreightWaves' Long Outbound Tender Volume Index. Despite the crisis, some executives, including Doug Waggoner, CEO of Echo Global Logistics, predict improvement beginning after the first quarter of 2026, though January and February remain traditionally slow months. While bankruptcies have increased\u201421 petitions in Q3 2025 versus 20 in Q2\u2014lower freight rates have benefited customers, and future supply constraints may lead to rate increases as weaker firms exit the market.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 22, 2026 02:03 AM\nSource:[TheStreet](https://www.thestreet.com/retail/mast-newkirk-bee-g-file-chapter-11-bankruptcy)\n\n**Layoff notices top 800 for N.J. workers at several major companies this month**\nMore than 800 New Jersey workers face potential layoffs in February 2026, according to WARN (Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification) Act filings with the state labor department.

This marks the highest number of bankruptcy filings in January since records began, surpassing the previous annual record of 2,282 cases set in 2024. The surge is attributed to prolonged '3-high' conditions\u2014high interest rates, high inflation, and high exchange rates\u2014leading to worsening financial health among businesses, particularly small and medium enterprises, startups, and venture companies. Of the 218 bankruptcy cases processed before final judgment in January, 92.66% (202 cases) were granted, with only 4 dismissed and 11 withdrawn, indicating widespread recognition of insolvency and debt overhang by courts. Financial indicators further reflect deteriorating conditions: the average non-performing loan rate for medium-sized enterprises at South Korea\u2019s four major banks reached 0.45% in Q4 2025\u2014the highest since Q4 2016\u2014and the total overdue loans of five regional banks rose 75.1% year-on-year to 1.3649 trillion won.

In In re Geden Holdings, Ltd., No. 25-90138, 2025 WL 2484883 (Bankr. S.D. Tex. Aug. 28, 2025), the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Texas denied recognition under Chapter 15 of the Bankruptcy Code for a Maltese liquidation proceeding due to the absence of meaningful activities by the liquidator from 2017 until the 2025 petition, despite the debtor\u2019s COMI or establishment in Malta at the time of the original liquidation. In In re Svenhard's Swedish Bakery, 154 F.4th 1100 (9th Cir. 2025), the Ninth Circuit expanded the scope of 'financial accommodations' under section 365(c)(2) to include deeply discounted pension plan withdrawal liabilities, ruling such arrangements cannot be assumed or assigned in bankruptcy. In Crivella Holdings Ltd. v. Mesearch Media Technologies Ltd., No. 2:25-cv-333, 2025 WL 2443400 (W.D. Pa. Aug. 25, 2025), the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Pennsylvania applied the Third Circuit's 'hypothetical test' and found a patent license agreement assumable in bankruptcy because it permitted assignment to a 'successor in interest' without consent, overriding general patent assignment prohibitions. In In re Oi S.A., No. 23-10193 (LGB), 2025 WL 2806591 (Bankr. S.D.N.Y. Oct. 1, 2025), the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of New York denied a motion to terminate Chapter 15 recognition of a Brazilian restructuring proceeding, holding that section 1519(d) of the Bankruptcy Code provides the sole authority for revocation of recognition and that no provision authorizes dismissal of a Chapter 15 case, especially given the ongoing restructuring and uncertain reorganization prospects.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 20, 2026 09:21 PM\nSource:[JD Supra](https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/business-restructuring-review-vol-25-no-1136711/)\n\n**Reliability Inc. to Reduce Outstanding Shares by 84% in Major Agreement**\nReliability Inc.

The company has operated at a loss for at least the past five years, with losses amounting to 1.8 billion rubles in 2021 and 2022, 383.1 million rubles in 2023, and 244.8 million rubles in 2024. KN\u00c9 had developed 300mm silicon wafers and integrated circuits with 90nm and 55nm process technologies, with plans to produce magnetoresistive memory (MRAM) chips. By April 2023, total investments in the project exceeded 200 million euros. Problems began in 2022, when the company cited 'changing geopolitical conditions' as making its independent development of MRAM production impossible. In late 2022, the Ministry of Industry and Trade filed a claim against KN\u00c9 for hundreds of millions of rubles due to failure to meet targets for a 1.17 billion ruble subsidy granted in 2016. In April, the Moscow Arbitration Court partially upheld the claim and fined KN\u00c9. By summer 2022, sources indicated the company\u2019s leadership began considering bankruptcy. Experts argue that sanctions destroyed the company\u2019s business model, though the project was already technically challenging and uneconomical even before sanctions. Profitability in this sector requires high utilization rates and large markets, both of which are severely limited in Russia. Alexander Timoshenko, head of 'Troichnye Tekhnologii,' stated that by early 2026, the company had no fixed assets, intellectual property, or more than three employees. He described the collapse as a textbook case of technological miscalculation, geopolitical factors, and corporate misconduct collectively devaluing multibillion-ruble investments. Earlier reports indicated that several major Russian electronics manufacturers are accumulating debt due to declining demand, leading to rising lawsuits and banks considering bankruptcy petitions.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 20, 2026 01:25 PM\nSource:[Lenta.ru](https://lenta.ru/news/2026/02/20/bankrot/)\n\n**Frontier Management trades 0 percent unchanged on Friday 20th of February**\nFrontier Management (7038.T) traded 0% unchanged during a 24-hour period ending at 10:42 AM Central Europe on Friday, February 20, 2026.

James Dempsey, who became CEO in January 2026 after Barry Biffle's departure, dismissed reports that Frontier might file for bankruptcy\u2014calling them 'categorically untrue'\u2014and attributed past booking issues to a schedule overhaul. Dempsey emphasized Frontier's focus on a high-utilization model, aiming to drive down unit costs and achieve profitability by right-sizing its fleet and targeting $200 million in annual cost savings by 2027. Despite a 19% stock drop in five days and a 44% decline over the past year, Dempsey highlighted a 10% increase in revenue per available seat mile (RASM) in the current quarter, citing disciplined pricing and transparency as key drivers. The airline is also pursuing a diversified product strategy, including plans for first-class seats later in 2026 and Wi-Fi by the end of 2027. However, Frontier faces challenges: its fourth-quarter profit (excluding sale-leaseback gains) fell 9.6%, costs per available seat mile rose 7% year-on-year, and aircraft utilization declined in 2025. Frontier ranked last among 10 North American airlines in on-time performance in 2025. The airline has been in merger talks with Spirit Airlines since 2022, but no agreement has been reached; Frontier previously made an unviable $2.16 billion offer after Spirit\u2019s second bankruptcy filing in August 2025. Analysts remain skeptical, with JP Morgan\u2019s Jamie Baker noting Frontier\u2019s 'deeply negative margins' are second only to Spirit\u2019s and among the worst peacetime margins ever seen. Industry consolidation is underway, with Sun Country and Allegiant merging in January 2026, but experts like former Frontier CEO Jeff Potter question the viability of a Frontier-Spirit merger due to both companies\u2019 ongoing financial struggles.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 11:25 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/frontier-bets-on-budget-travelers-as-other-airlines-focus-on-premium-market-4512982)\n\n**Spirit Airlines Eyes Merger With Frontier Amid Restructuring**\nSpirit Aviation Holdings Inc., which filed for bankruptcy in August 2024, is in confidential discussions to merge with Frontier Group Holdings, according to sources familiar with the matter. A deal could be announced as soon as December 2025, though the talks may not result in a transaction. The potential merger represents a pivotal move for Spirit, which has been operating under restructuring since its bankruptcy filing. The proposed combination comes amid ongoing challenges for ultra-low-cost carriers, including rising operational costs and intense competition from larger U.S. airlines.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 16, 2025 11:46 PM\nSource:[news.bloomberglaw.com](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/bankruptcy-law/spirit-airlines-eyes-merger-with-frontier-amid-restructuring)\n\n**Frontier Stock Climbs On Merger Talks With Spirit Aviation**\nFrontier Group Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ: ULCC) shares rose more than 9% in after-hours trading on December 16, 2025, following reports that it is in talks to merge with bankrupt Spirit Aviation Holdings, Inc. (OTC: FLYYQ). According to Bloomberg, sources familiar with the matter indicated that a potential merger could be announced as soon as December 2025. The news coincided with Frontier\u2019s announcement of the sudden replacement of its former CEO, Barry Biffle, who was succeeded by James G. Dempsey, formerly the company\u2019s president, effective December 16, 2025. Dempsey will serve as interim CEO, with Biffle remaining in an advisory role until December 31, 2025. Spirit Aviation had previously attempted a $3.8 billion merger with JetBlue Airways Corp. (NASDAQ: JBLU), but the deal was blocked in January 2024 by a federal judge who ruled it would violate antitrust laws by eliminating a key low-cost competitor and increasing consumer fares. The parties mutually terminated the agreement, leading to Spirit\u2019s Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing in November 2024. While ULCC shares surged in after-hours trading, Spirit Aviation shares remained flat due to the OTC market being closed. \nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 16, 2025 11:30 PM\nSource:[Benzinga News](https://www.benzinga.com/m-a/25/12/49438194/frontier-stock-climbs-on-merger-talks-with-spirit-aviation)\n\n**Spirit Airlines explores merger with Frontier amid bankruptcy - Bloomberg By Investing.com**\nSpirit Aviation Holdings Inc. is reportedly in discussions to merge with Frontier Group Holdings Inc., according to a Bloomberg report from December 16, 2025, citing anonymous sources familiar with the matter.

The airline plans to introduce a First Class option in 2024 and offer in-flight Wi-Fi by the end of 2027. CEO Dempsey noted that customer willingness to pay for premium products has increased since the pandemic, and Frontier's revenue per available seat mile (RASM) rose 10% in the current quarter. Despite increasing seat capacity by 18% in early 2024, Frontier flew 3.5% fewer seats in 2025 compared to the previous year, according to Cirium. The airline ranked last among ten North American carriers for on-time performance in 2025. Wall Street remains skeptical: Frontier Group Holdings' stock dropped 19% over five trading days and 44% over one year. JP Morgan analyst Jamie Baker described Frontier\u2019s margins as among the worst outside of crisis periods, second only to Spirit Airlines. Frontier and Spirit have been in merger talks since 2022, mirroring broader industry consolidation, as seen in Sun Country and Allegiant\u2019s announced merger in January, signaling a shift in pricing power post-pandemic.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 01, 1970 12:00 AM\nSource:[airliners.de](https://www.airliners.de/frontier-airlines-dementiert-insolvenzgeruechte-kuendigt-sparpaket/85985)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens (Small Models)', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
