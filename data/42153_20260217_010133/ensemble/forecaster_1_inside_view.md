## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE:**
1. **Current rate stability (3.57-3.73% range for 30+ days)** - Direct FRED data, multiple confirmations, clear pattern
   - Impact: Strongly supports narrow distribution centered near current level

2. **Low daily volatility (0.06pp std dev)** - Quantified from primary data
   - Impact: Limits expected 9-day movement to ~0.18pp (1σ)

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**
1. **Recent U.S. CPI miss (Feb 13)** - Official data, dovish implications
   - Impact: Slight downward pressure on rates, but CP market already stable before release
   - Causal link: Lower inflation → lower Fed terminal rate expectations → lower CP rates
   - Limitation: 4 days old, may already be priced in

2. **Mean reversion tendency** - Current 3.62% below 7-day (3.66%) and 30-day (3.64%) averages
   - Impact: Modest upward pull of 2-4bp over 9 days

3. **Fed pause positioning** - No meetings until March, market expects stability
   - Impact: Reduces probability of large moves

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**
1. **Month-end effects (Feb 26)** - Anecdotal, could add ±5bp noise
2. **Global rate trends** - Multiple countries cutting/pausing, but different markets
3. **Longer-term downward trend** - 6-month decline from 4.39% to 3.62%, but momentum has slowed

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 9 business days (Feb 17 → Feb 26, 2026)

**If halved to 4-5 days:**
- Expected movement would decrease proportionally (~0.09pp vs 0.18pp)
- Distribution would tighten significantly around 3.62%
- 10th-90th percentile range might compress to 3.54-3.70%

**If doubled to 18 days:**
- Expected movement would increase (~0.25pp)
- More time for Fed communications, economic data releases
- Greater probability of breaking out of 3.57-3.73% range
- 10th-90th percentile range might expand to 3.40-3.85%

**Current 9-day timeframe considerations:**
- Too short for major policy shifts
- Long enough for mean reversion forces
- Spans late-month period (potential technical factors)
- No major scheduled catalysts

## (d) Justification for Distribution Shifts

**Starting from outside view base rates:**
- 10th: 3.48, 20th: 3.54, 40th: 3.61, 60th: 3.66, 80th: 3.72, 90th: 3.79

**Adjustments based on current evidence:**

1. **Tighten distribution slightly** - Current volatility regime is exceptionally stable
   - Recent 30-day range (3.57-3.73%) is narrower than historical 9-day movements
   - Daily std dev of 0.06pp is at lower end of historical range
   - Justification: Outside view may overestimate tail probabilities

2. **Shift median up marginally** - Mean reversion to 3.64-3.66%
   - Current 3.62% is 2-4bp below recent averages
   - No strong catalyst for continued decline
   - CPI data already 4 days old, likely absorbed
   - Justification: Small upward drift of 1-2bp over 9 days

3. **Maintain symmetric distribution** - No asymmetric catalysts identified
   - Fed in pause mode (moderate evidence)
   - No scheduled hawkish/dovish events
   - Market positioning appears balanced

**Final calibration reasoning:**
- Keep 10th percentile at 3.48 (allows for unexpected dovish shock or technical breakdown)
- Raise 20th from 3.54 to 3.56 (tighter given stability)
- Raise 40th from 3.61 to 3.62 (current level as lower-middle anchor)
- Raise 60th from 3.66 to 3.67 (mean reversion target)
- Keep 80th at 3.72 (upper bound of recent range + small buffer)
- Lower 90th from 3.79 to 3.77 (tighter given low volatility)

Distribution calibration:

The outside view provided a reasonable starting point anchored to 3.62% with ±0.17pp typical 9-day movement. However, the exceptional stability of the past 30 days (16bp total range) and very low daily volatility (0.06pp) justify a modest tightening of the distribution.

The recent CPI miss (Feb 13) was dovish but occurred 4 days ago and the CP rate has remained stable at 3.62% since Feb 12, suggesting the news is already incorporated. The mean reversion pull toward 3.64-3.66% is real but modest over 9 days.

I'm adjusting the distribution to:
- Slightly tighten the 20th-80th percentile range (3.56-3.72 vs 3.54-3.72)
- Nudge the median up 1bp to reflect mean reversion (3.645 vs 3.635)
- Maintain wide tails for unknown unknowns (10th at 3.48, 90th at 3.77)

This results in an 80% confidence interval of 3.56-3.72 (16bp), which aligns with the observed 30-day range and accounts for potential month-end volatility.

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** 90-Day AA Financial Commercial Paper Interest Rate on Feb 26, 2026, in percent units, 9 business days forward from Feb 17.
   ✓ Analysis focuses exactly on this rate and timeframe

2. **Outside view base rate:** Started with 10th: 3.48, 90th: 3.79, centered ~3.64
   ✓ Final prediction maintains this anchor with modest tightening justified by current stability

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median ≈ 3.645%, mean ≈ 3.645%; makes sense given current 3.62% with slight upward mean reversion

4. **Key evidence pieces:**
   - Current rate 3.62%, stable 30-day range 3.57-3.73% (STRONG, valid)
   - Daily volatility 0.06pp, implies 9-day σ ≈ 0.18pp (STRONG, valid)
   - Mean reversion to 3.64-3.66% averages (MODERATE, valid)
   - Recent CPI miss dovish but already 4 days old (MODERATE, valid)
   - No major catalysts in 9-day window (MODERATE, valid)

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Unexpected Fed hawkish communication or financial stress event → would push rate UP to 3.80-4.00%

6. **Status quo outcome:** Current 3.62% is the status quo; given low volatility and short timeframe, slight upward drift to 3.64-3.66% is most likely

7. **Technicalities:** ✓ Values strictly increasing, ✓ units in percent, ✓ all values within bounds (3.043-5.045)
