Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**FRED/Federal Reserve sources (multiple):**
- High quality, primary data source
- Most recent data: 12 Feb 2026 showing 3.62%
- Recent history: 3.63% (6 Feb), 3.64% (10 Feb), 3.73% (9 Feb)
- Factual, no opinions; authoritative source for resolution

**AskNews articles:**
Most articles discuss mortgage rates, deposit rates, and commercial paper markets in South Korea, India, Russia, Brazil, Argentina, and Australia—geographically and instrumentally distinct from US 90-day AA financial CP. Key relevant insights:

- **India CD/CP shift article (16 Feb 2026):** Factual data on Indian market dynamics; shows global short-term debt market activity but no direct US relevance. Moderate quality for context only.

- **US CPI article (13 Feb 2026):** Reports January CPI at 2.4% YoY (below 2.5% forecast), core at 2.5%. This is **strong evidence** as lower-than-expected inflation reduces pressure for Fed tightening, supporting stable/lower short-term rates. Long-term Treasury yields fell to 4.05% (-5 bp), confirming market interpretation.

- **RBA rate hike (Feb 2026):** Australia raised rates 25 bp to 3.85% due to inflation resurgence. Weak evidence for US—different central bank, different inflation dynamics.

- **BlackRock 2026 outlook:** Discusses AI investment themes, structural factors; no specific short-term rate forecast. Weak evidence.

- **Korean/international articles on deposit/CP rates:** Provide global context on money market conditions but no direct US AA financial CP data. Weak evidence.

**Expert opinions identified:**
- Fed Chair Powell (from US Bank summary): Characterized economy as "improving balance," expects tariff effects to fade. Markets price two 0.25% cuts in 2026. This is **moderate evidence**—suggests stable-to-lower rate environment but no imminent move in next 9 days.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
1. **Recent US inflation data (13 Feb):** CPI below expectations → reduced Fed tightening pressure → stable/lower CP rates expected. Treasury yields fell 5 bp immediately, confirming market interpretation.

2. **Historical volatility pattern:** 90-day AA financial CP shows σ ≈ 7 bp over 9-day windows in normal periods; current 30-day range (3.57-3.73%) = 16 bp suggests elevated but not crisis-level volatility.

**Moderate evidence:**
1. **Fed policy stance:** No FOMC meeting until March; fed funds futures imply minimal change (~2 bp easing) by 26 Feb. Status quo bias strong.

2. **Recent trend:** Series declined from 3.73% (9 Feb) to 3.62% (12 Feb) = -11 bp over 3 days, suggesting modest downward momentum, but 7-day average (3.66%) and 30-day average (3.64%) bracket current level, indicating mean reversion zone.

**Weak evidence:**
1. Global rate movements (RBA hike, Korean deposit shifts) provide context but limited US predictive power over 9 days.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Forecast horizon:** 9 calendar days (6 business days) from 17 Feb to 26 Feb 2026.

**If halved (4-5 days):** Would narrow distribution significantly—historical 4-day σ ≈ 5 bp, so 10th-90th range would compress to roughly 3.56-3.70%. Status quo (3.62%) would dominate.

**If doubled (18 days):** Would widen distribution—historical 18-day σ ≈ 10 bp, expanding 10th-90th range to approximately 3.49-3.77%. More time allows Fed communication, data releases, and potential liquidity events to impact rates.

**Key consideration:** No major scheduled events in this window (no FOMC, no major data releases beyond routine auctions). This favors narrow distribution centered near current level.

## (d) Justification for Inside View Adjustment

**Starting point:** Outside view suggests μ = 3.63%, σ ≈ 7 bp, with 10th-90th range of 3.45-3.88%.

**Adjustments warranted:**

1. **Tighten distribution (moderate confidence):** The outside view's tail widening (to 3.45-3.88%) assumes crisis-like moves are plausible. However, current conditions show:
   - No scheduled catalysts in 9-day window
   - Recent CPI data reduced uncertainty (inflation moderating)
   - Fed in "wait and see" mode with stable policy expectations
   - Money market functioning normally (no liquidity stress signals)

2. **Slight downward bias:** Recent 3-day move (-11 bp) and lower-than-expected CPI suggest modest downward pressure, but mean reversion from 7-day/30-day averages (3.64-3.66%) limits this. Net effect: shift median down ~1-2 bp to 3.61%.

3. **Narrower tails:** Outside view's 90th percentile (3.88%) implies +26 bp move—only seen in crisis periods. Given stable macro backdrop, compress upper tail to 3.75% (90th). Lower tail: compress to 3.48% (10th), acknowledging small probability of unexpected dovish signal or liquidity surplus.

**Distribution calibration:**

The outside view appropriately captures normal volatility but overweights tail risk given current stability. Adjust:
- Median: 3.61% (vs. outside 3.63%)
- Compress 10th-90th from 3.45-3.88% to 3.48-3.75%
- Maintain moderate uncertainty around 20th-80th percentiles to avoid overconfidence

## Distribution Calibration

**Central tendency:** Last print 3.62%, recent average 3.64%, downward momentum modest. Median forecast: 3.61%.

**10th percentile (3.48%):** Requires -14 bp move. Possible if unexpected dovish Fed communication or money market surplus emerges, but low probability (~10%) given stable conditions.

**20th percentile (3.54%):** -8 bp move. Plausible if downward trend continues; aligns with lower bound of recent 30-day range.

**40th percentile (3.59%):** -3 bp move. Modest continuation of recent decline; reasonable given CPI data.

**60th percentile (3.63%):** +1 bp move. Essentially status quo/mean reversion to recent average.

**80th percentile (3.69%):** +7 bp move. Return toward upper end of recent range if risk sentiment shifts or month-end dynamics tighten liquidity.

**90th percentile (3.75%):** +13 bp move. Requires unexpected hawkish development or technical tightness; tail risk but plausible.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** 90-Day AA Financial Commercial Paper Interest Rate on 26 Feb 2026, measured in percent, from FRED series RIFSPPFAAD90NB. ✓

2. **Outside view base rate:** μ = 3.63%, σ ≈ 7 bp, 10th-90th: 3.45-3.88%. My forecast narrows tails given stable near-term conditions but maintains central uncertainty. ✓

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 3.61%; mean ≈ 3.62%. Aligns with slight downward bias from recent CPI data while respecting mean reversion forces. ✓

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - US CPI below forecast (13 Feb) → reduced tightening pressure (factually valid)
   - No FOMC meeting or major data releases in 9-day window (factually valid)
   - Recent 3-day decline (-11 bp) suggests modest downward momentum (factually valid)
   - Historical 9-day σ ≈ 7 bp in normal periods (factually valid from reference class)
   - 30-day range 3.57-3.73% shows elevated but controlled volatility (factually valid)

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Unexpected liquidity tightness from Treasury auction settlement or technical factors could push rate up 15-20 bp, making my 90th percentile (3.75%) look conservative. This would push outcome UP.

6. **Status quo outcome:** Current level 3.62% sits within my 40th-60th percentile range (3.59-3.63%), appropriately reflecting high probability that rate stays near current level given short timeframe and stable conditions. ✓

7. **Technicalities:** Values strictly increasing, units in percent as requested, all values within bounds (3.043-5.044705). ✓
