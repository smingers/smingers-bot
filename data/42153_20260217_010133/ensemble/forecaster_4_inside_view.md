Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED series pages (RIFSPPFAAD90NB, ALFRED snapshot) – primary data, up-to-date to 12 Feb 2026. Factual, highest quality.  
2. Federal Reserve CP release table – same official data, confirms recent 3.6-3.7 % prints; high quality, 12 Feb 2026.  
3. Fed methodology page – factual background on how the rate is calculated; high quality, but not forward-looking.  
4. U.S. CPI / market-reaction article (15 Feb 2026) – secondary press report, reputable outlet (Diamond Online). Factual CPI number (2.4 % y/y) + market interpretation that further Fed cuts are likelier. Moderate quality, time-relevant.  
5. U.S. Bank “Fed outlook” note (19 Sep 2025, updated Jan 2026) – professional commentary; identifies current Fed-funds range 3.50-3.75 % and market pricing of two 25 bp cuts later in 2026. Moderate quality, slightly stale but still current regime.  
6. Remaining AskNews pieces (Brazil, Russia, India, S. Korea, Australia, Argentina, China) – about foreign money-markets; contain no direct bearing on a U.S. AA financial CP rate over the next nine days. Weak relevance.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong:  
• Latest FRED data show the rate locked in a 3.57–3.73 % corridor for a month; one-week σ ≈ 0.06 pp.  
• No FOMC meeting before 26 Feb; Fed target range steady at 3.50–3.75 %.  
Moderate:  
• Slightly softer CPI has nudged expectations of future easing → marginal downward pressure on 90-day term instruments.  
• Month-end can add temporary funding demand → mild upward skew.  
Weak:  
• Foreign interest-rate stories; U.S. equity volatility anecdotes; individual corporate financings.

Net: evidence largely supports “little change”, with a tiny downward drift offset by month-end effects.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon = 9 calendar days (~7 business days).  
If horizon halved (4 days) I would narrow the 80–20 band by ~30 %.  
If doubled (18 days) I would widen the 80–20 band by ~40 % and center ~1-2 bp lower (after month-end passes).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
Base-rate (outside view) median 3.66 %.  
Inside view:  
• minus 1–2 bp for softer CPI & growing cut expectations,  
• plus 1 bp for typical late-Feb funding firmness.  
Resulting median 3.65 %.  
Empirical daily σ (0.06 pp) over 7 business days ⇒ √7·σ ≈ 0.16 pp; I widen further for fat tails.  
Tails respect last-year minima (3.04 %) and maxima (4.39 %) but stay well inside given short horizon.

Distribution calibration
Percentile 10: current –0.14 pp (≈ 2.3 σ) ⇒ 3.48 %  
Percentile 20: 3.55 %  
Percentile 40: 3.62 %  
Percentile 60: 3.68 %  
Percentile 80: 3.78 %  
Percentile 90: 3.95 %  

Checklist:
1. Target variable: FRED series RIFSPPFAAD90NB closing value, percent, for 26 Feb 2026.  
2. Outside-view distribution stated above.  
3. Implied median = 3.65 %, mean ≈ 3.66 %; consistent with rationale.  
4. Key evidence: (i) latest level 3.62 %; (ii) Fed target 3.50-3.75 % locked until mid-Mar; (iii) historical week-ahead σ 0.06 pp; (iv) month-end funding bias; (v) softer CPI lowers expectations.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden funding stress (e.g., large bank headline) could spike CP to >4.2 %.  
6. Status-quo check says lean toward little change – distribution centred near 3.65 %.  
7. Percentile values strictly increasing, units in percent, within open bounds.
