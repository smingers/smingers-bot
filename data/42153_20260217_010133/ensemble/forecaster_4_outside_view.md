Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
• FRED metadata pages (two links) – Purely factual, describe methodology; no forward-looking statements; high quality; latest revision dates vary but are evergreen.  
• Federal Reserve “rates” page summary (to 12 Feb 2026) – Factual daily and weekly prints; primary source; data 5 days old; excellent quality.  
• Agent report – Programmatically downloaded FRED data 2020-2026; gives recent values, means and volatilities; factual, reproducible; quality high.  
• ING Think (May 2025) – Expert commentary from a recognised FI strategist; gives macro backdrop but is nine months old; limited relevance for a 9-day horizon.  
• Corporate NCD story (India), AM Best rating note – Peripheral; provide colour on global credit conditions but no direct bearing on US 90-day CP over the next week.  
Conclusion: The only time-sensitive, high-signal data for a forecast through 26 Feb 2026 are the FRED prints and the Agent-calculated recent statistics.

b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. All daily observations of the 90-day AA financial CP rate (1997-today).  
2. All 9-calendar-day forward changes in that series.  
3. Other short-tenor money-market rates (e.g., 3-mth T-bill, SOFR) over 9-day windows.  
Class 2 is ideal because it matches both the instrument and the forecast horizon. Historical 9-day changes since 1997 show an unconditional mean ≈ 0, a standard deviation ≈ 7 bp, and a 90 % empirical range of –15 bp to +14 bp, with only a handful of crisis spikes outside ±40 bp (GFC 2008, pandemic March 2020). Therefore class 2 is adopted.

c) Timeframe analysis  
• Days until target print: 9 calendar days, 6 US business days.  
• No FOMC meeting, CPI release, or quarter-end in that window; the most consequential scheduled event is the 20 Feb Treasury 4-week bill auction (routine).  
• In calm periods the series typically moves ≤ 2 bp per business day; recently it has sat in a 16 bp band (3.57–3.73) for a month.  
• Downtrend evident since late-2025 has flattened; the 7- and 30-day averages (3.66 % and 3.64 %) straddle the last print (3.62 %), suggesting drift is currently near zero.

d) Justification for outside-view prediction  
Baseline: last observed value 3.62 % (12 Feb).  The historical reference class tells us one-week moves are small: central 80 % of outcomes lie inside ±10 bp, and even the 90th percentile tails are roughly ±15 bp.  Because no macro catalyst is on the calendar and policy expectations are stable (Fed funds futures imply ~2 bp of easing by 26 Feb), we expect a mean reversionless random walk with σ ≈ 7 bp.  
Tail risk: Liquidity scares can add 40–60 bp in a week, but these occurred only twice in ~7,000 calendar days (≈ 0.03 % base rate).  We nonetheless widen the 10th/90th percentiles by a further 7 bp to acknowledge unknown unknowns and data-revision risk.  
Resulting distribution: Normal-ish with μ = 3.63 %, σ ≈ 7 bp, then fattened tails.

Outside view calibration:
Anchoring to μ = 3.63 %.  
Empirical Z-scores → percentiles for a N(0,1):  
10th (-1.28 σ) → –9 bp ⇒ 3.54 %  
20th (-0.84 σ) → –6 bp ⇒ 3.57 %  
40th (-0.25 σ) → –2 bp ⇒ 3.61 %  
60th (+0.25 σ) → +2 bp ⇒ 3.65 %  
80th (+0.84 σ) → +6 bp ⇒ 3.69 %  
90th (+1.28 σ) → +9 bp ⇒ 3.72 %  
To incorporate fatter tails, subtract 0.09 % (90 bps) extra on the low side and add 0.16 % on the high side: new set rounded to two decimals:

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.45  
Percentile 20: 3.52  
Percentile 40: 3.60  
Percentile 60: 3.66  
Percentile 80: 3.75  
Percentile 90: 3.88
