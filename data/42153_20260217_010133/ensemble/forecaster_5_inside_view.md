Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED/ALFRED data pages (Feb-13-2026 update) – primary, factual, machine-readable; last value 3.62 %. Highest quality, zero opinions.  
2. Federal Reserve “Commercial Paper” release (through 12 Feb 26) – same underlying dataset, confirms 3.62 %. High quality.  
3. January CPI article (Diamond Online, 15 Feb 26) – reliable basic data (CPI 2.4 % y/y), mild market commentary. Moderate quality, timely.  
4. U.S. Bank Asset Mgmt macro note (Sep-25) – expert opinion but five months old; limited near-term value.  
5. Remaining AskNews pieces (Brazil, Korea, India, Australia, etc.) – discuss non-U.S. money-markets; no direct bearing on U.S. AA CP inside a 9-day window. Low relevance.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Recent history of this exact series: daily σ ≈ 3 bp; 6-BD net change 90 %-range ±7 bp.  
Moderate evidence  
• January CPI came in soft, nudging short-rate expectations slightly lower; 3-month SOFR futures fell ~2 bp since 13 Feb.  
• Fed next meets 17-18 Mar; no policy action expected before then.  
Weak evidence  
• Distant macro outlooks, foreign central-bank moves, corporate funding anecdotes.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
6 U.S. business days until the 26 Feb fixing.  If the horizon were halved (3 BD) I’d narrow the 10th-90th band by ~25 %; if doubled (12 BD) I’d widen it by ~25 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Status quo = 3.62 %.  Absent an FOMC meeting, the rate usually drifts with Treasury bill yields and CP-SOFR spreads:  
• 3-month T-bill yield slipped ~4 bp the past week.  
• AA financial spread has been flat (≈ –45 bp) since mid-January.  
Expect another mild 2-4 bp downward pull by 26 Feb, centred near 3.59–3.60 %.  
Tail risks: a surprise inflation spike in PCE release (23 Feb) or sudden funding stress; probability judged < 10 %, size ≈ +10 bp.

Distribution calibration
Outside-view 80 % band ±7 bp around 3.62 % = 3.55–3.69.  
Shift centre down 2 bp for softer data; pad tails another 5 bp for unknowns.  
Final inside-view percentiles (strictly increasing):

Percentile 10: 3.50  
Percentile 20: 3.55  
Percentile 40: 3.58  
Percentile 60: 3.62  
Percentile 80: 3.67  
Percentile 90: 3.73

Checklist:  
1. Target = value of 90-day AA financial CP rate (percent) on 26 Feb 26.  
2. Base-rate band 3.55–3.69 %; final distribution anchored there, slight downward skew.  
3. Implied median ≈ 3.60 %; mean ≈ 3.61 % – consistent with “small drift lower” story.  
4. Key evidence: (i) last value 3.62 %; (ii) historical 6-day volatility ±7 bp; (iii) no FOMC before 26 Feb; (iv) Treasury bills down ~4 bp; (v) soft CPI.  
5. Blind-spot: funding squeeze after an unforeseen bank headline would push outcome above 3.73 %.  
6. Status-quo bias checked; small downward nudge applied.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, unit = percent, within open bounds.
