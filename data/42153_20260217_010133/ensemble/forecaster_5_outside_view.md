Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED metadata pages (RIFSPPFAAD90NB; CPF3M; DCPN3M).  Purely factual, describe the series; no opinions; high-quality, up-to-date.  
2. Fed “about” page for Commercial Paper.  Methodology only; factual, dated but timeless; no forward-looking content.  
3. Fed H.15 daily data summary through 12 Feb 2026.  Primary data source; factual; released 13 Feb 2026.  Provides the last known value (3.62 %).  
4. Agent report pulling the full daily history.  Derived directly from FRED; transparent calculations; very reliable for recent trend & volatility.  
5. ING May 2025 commentary on money-markets.  Informed opinion from a named strategist; ten months old; some context on how CP tracks policy but stale for a 9-day horizon.  
6. Articles on IIFL Finance NCDs and AM Best/Prudential ratings.  Factual but about Indian long-tenor debt and one issuer’s credit; immaterial for a near-term U.S. AA-financial 90-day CP rate forecast.

Conclusion: Only the FRED/H.15 data and the Agent report are materially useful for a 9-day outlook; the rest supply background but no incremental signal.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. Daily changes in the same series during the past 12 months.  
2. Daily changes during the past 5 years.  
3. Daily changes in the Fed funds target band over comparable periods.

Class 1 is preferred: identical instrument, monetary regime very similar to today, and contains three regular FOMC cycles of easing.  Standard deviation of daily changes in the past year ≈ 3 bp; 95 % of 9-day moves stayed within ±10 bp.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until the fixing that will be published for 26 Feb 2026: 9 calendar days, 6 business days.  Over similar 6-BD windows in the last year the net change distribution (n≈250) was:  
• Median 0 bp,  
• 10th percentile –7 bp,  
• 90th percentile +7 bp,  
• Max move ±13 bp (occurred the day after an FOMC decision).  
No FOMC meeting is scheduled before 26 Feb 2026; thus the extreme tail risk (> ±13 bp) is historically < 1 %.

(d) Justification  
Status quo (3.62 % on 12 Feb) sits in the middle of a one-month 3.57–3.73 % band.  The Fed’s next policy meeting is mid-March, so only routine liquidity flows are in play.  Recent CP spreads to SOFR are stable; no credit events affecting AA financial issuers have surfaced.  Therefore the base case is “little change”, with a slight downward bias (the six-month trend is –1 bp/week).  Unknown-unknown allowance (e.g., an emergency Fed action, data glitch) is reflected by widening the 10th/90th percentiles beyond the empirical ±7 bp.

Outside view calibration:
Anchor: 3.62 %.  
Empirical 80 % band (±7 bp) → 3.55–3.69 %.  
Add 5 bp extra margin on each side for low-probability shocks → 3.50–3.74 % as the 10th–90th interval.  
Allocate percentiles linearly inside that range, with a small downward skew to echo the gentle downward trend.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.50  
Percentile 20: 3.55  
Percentile 40: 3.60  
Percentile 60: 3.64  
Percentile 80: 3.70  
Percentile 90: 3.74
