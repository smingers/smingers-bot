Analysis:
To forecast the 90-day AA Financial Commercial Paper (CP) rate for 2026-02-26 I need up-to-date information on:  
• The most recent daily prints of series RIFSPPFAAD90NB (to establish the current trend and week-to-date moves).  
• Money-market commentary on CP funding costs, especially any shifts caused by Treasury bill supply, reserve balances, or quarter-end funding pressures heading into late February.  
• Expectations for the Fed funds target range around the 26 Feb FOMC blackout period, since CP rates track SOFR/FFR closely.  
• Any news on credit-spread pressures specific to high-grade (AA) financial issuers.  

Thus I want sources that publish: the latest FRED data point, analysts’ near-term outlook for CP yields, and money-market notes reacting to recent CPI, PPI, or Fed-speak since those directly steer front-end rates.
