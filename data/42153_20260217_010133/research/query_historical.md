Analysis:
To form a base rate for the 90-Day AA Financial Commercial Paper Interest Rate on 2026-02-26 I need:  
• A long time-series of the RIFSPPFAAD90NB daily data to measure recent level, volatility, and the typical weekly drift over the last few years—especially over the most recent tightening cycle.  
• News or commentary about short-term funding markets (e.g., expectations for Fed rate cuts, year-end funding pressures, large issuance) that might shift the rate in the next nine days.  
• Comparable short-term benchmarks (3-month Treasury bill, SOFR, Fed funds futures) to gauge where commercial-paper rates usually trade relative to policy expectations.  
Therefore my searches will pull (1) the raw FRED data, (2) background and methodological pages, and (3) any very recent news about commercial-paper or money-market conditions.
