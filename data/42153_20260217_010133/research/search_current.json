As of February 17, 2026, the upper limit of fixed-rate home loans at five major South Korean banks\u2014KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Hana, Woori, and NH Nonghyup\u2014reached 6.74%, nearing the 7% level. Variable-rate loans are also rising, with rates between 3.68% and 6.38% as of February 13. This increase is driven by sustained rises in benchmark financial bond yields and the COFIX (funding cost index), with the 5-year AAA financial bond rate at 3.687% (up 0.188 percentage points from last year\u2019s end) and COFIX increasing to 2.89% in December 2025 from November\u2019s 2.81%. The Bank of Korea\u2019s rate-cutting cycle has effectively ended, and continued tightening of household loan regulations are expected to keep loan rates rising. Borrowers who secured loans at 2% interest rates five years ago during low-rate periods are now facing significant interest rate resets, potentially increasing their rates to 4\u20135% range. In response, financial regulators are considering introducing long-term fixed-rate mortgage products with 30-year terms, as current fixed-rate options are mostly limited to 5-year periods. Despite higher fixed rates, more borrowers are choosing variable-rate loans due to lower immediate interest burdens. According to the Bank of Korea\u2019s economic statistics system, the share of variable-rate home loans rose to 13.4% in December 2025, up from 9.8% in November, marking the highest level since December 2024. The overall share of variable-rate household loans also reached 51.1%, slightly below the 53.2% peak in December 2024.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 11:00 PM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20260213_0003515874)\n\n**High Interest Rates to End in March? Copom Plans 6 Selic Cuts by December**\nThe Brazilian Central Bank signals that the Selic interest rate, currently at 15% per year, may begin to decline starting in March 2026, following a period of high rates that constrained consumer spending. According to the Focus Report, inflation projections of 3.99% allow the Monetary Policy Committee (Copom) to reduce borrowing costs without losing control over prices. The market, supported by XP Investimentos, expects six gradual cuts of 0.50 percentage points each, with the first cut anticipated in the 17\u201318 March meeting (from 15% to 14.50%), followed by reductions in May (14%), August (13%), November (12.75%), and December (12.25%). A pause is expected in June for fiscal evaluation. These rate cuts are projected to boost commercial confidence, which dropped 6.1% according to the CNC, and improve access to credit for households and businesses. The impact on housing is significant: a new R$ 300,000 mortgage (SAC system, 30 years) could see monthly payments drop from R$ 3,850 at 15% to approximately R$ 3,160 at 12.25%, saving about R$ 690 per month. Similar savings are expected in vehicle and appliance financing, with estimated monthly payments 10%\u201315% lower by year-end. For investors, falling rates suggest shifting from post-fixed instruments like Tesouro Selic and CDBs 100% CDI to prefixated bonds to lock in higher returns before cuts accelerate. Alternatively, NTN-B (IPCA+) bonds offer inflation protection with real returns.

Experts predict that mortgage rates will only slightly decrease in response, with potential reductions of 0.5\u20131 percentage point, possibly bringing rates down to 18\u201318.5% for market programs. The impact on the real estate market is expected to be moderate, with no significant surge in demand or price growth anticipated. According to Alexander Tsyganyov from the Financial University, substantial market revival requires further rate cuts, ideally bringing the key rate below 12% to enable mortgage rates of 14\u201315% or lower. Currently, mortgage rates remain high, averaging 19.5\u201319.9% for market programs, with the lowest rates for salary clients at 17.5\u201318%. Experts note that while the reduction in the key rate may not trigger a sharp rise in demand, it reduces financial stress for borrowers. For example, a 4 million ruble mortgage over 25 years at 16% results in 12.7 million rubles in interest, compared to 12.2 million rubles at 15.5%\u2014a savings of half a million rubles, or 12% of the loan amount. The market is expected to see gradual growth, particularly in the secondary housing segment, where prices may slowly rise due to prolonged suppression by high rates. However, the primary market remains sensitive to changes in programs like 'Family Mortgage' and presidential initiatives on affordable rental. The Russian Guild of Realtors reports a 20\u201330% increase in demand by late 2026, driven by declining rates and deposits, with price increases on the secondary market mainly due to structural shifts in supply, such as owners of newly built homes setting prices above market levels, leading to higher average prices despite stable or slightly increasing listing durations and price fluctuations of 300,000\u2013500,000 rubles monthly.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 02:40 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440/\u0444\u0438\u043d\u0430\u043d\u0441\u044b](https://finance.rambler.ru/money/56051434-snizhenie-klyuchevoy-stavki-pozvolit-ipotechnikam-sekonomit-polmilliona-rubley/)\n\n**Short-term debt flows shifting from CPs to CDs**\nInvestors are shifting from commercial paper (CP) to certificates of deposit (CDs) in India, driven by rising CD issuances, higher yields, and lower perceived credit risk. As of January 31, 2026, the outstanding amount of CDs rose to Rs 5.8 trillion, up from Rs 4.9 trillion on August 22, 2025. Concurrently, outstanding CPs declined to Rs 4.3 trillion from Rs 5.5 trillion by August 15, 2024, a drop of approximately Rs 1 trillion over the same period. Mutual funds, which traditionally favor CDs, are increasing allocations due to higher yields and improved liquidity. Banks are issuing more CDs to bridge the gap between strong credit growth\u201413.1% year-on-year in the first fortnight of 2026\u2014and sluggish deposit growth\u201410.6% year-on-year\u2014during the same period. Credit contracted by Rs 1.88 trillion while deposits declined by Rs 3.57 trillion in that fortnight. CD rates have risen, making them more attractive compared to CPs, which are issued by corporates and carry higher credit risk. Dhawal Dalal of Edelweiss Asset Management noted that the surge in primary CD supply in January and February has led to increased investor interest. Saurabh Bhalerao of CareEdge Ratings emphasized that the key differentiator is the borrower: CDs are issued by banks (lower risk), while CPs are issued by corporates. Banks issued over Rs 1.21 trillion in CDs in the first 10 days of February, exceeding January\u2019s full-month issuance of Rs 1.48 trillion, following a liquidity infusion by the RBI that softened CD rates. The Bank of Baroda report projects continued momentum in CD issuances due to sustained credit demand and persistent pressure on deposit mobilization amid sticky interest rates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 07:44 AM\nSource:[Rediff.com India Ltd.](https://www.rediff.com/business/report/short-term-debt-flows-shifting-from-cps-to-cds/20260216.htm)\n\n**End of rate cuts, ample liquidity: Why short-end yields above 7% look attractive, says Devang Shah**\nDevang Shah, Head of Fixed Income at Axis Mutual Fund, argues in an ETMarkets Smart Talk interview that with the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) likely at the end of its rate-cut cycle and liquidity conditions remaining comfortable, fixed income investors should shift focus to the short end of the yield curve. He highlights that 1-2 year AAA corporate bond yields are available above 7%, with a low probability of further rate hikes, making accrual-oriented strategies in the short to medium segment more attractive than long-duration bets. Shah forecasts the 10-year G-Sec yield to trade in the 6.60-6.80% range until March 2026, with potential movement to 6.80-7.00% if growth and inflation rise. He anticipates $20-25 billion in foreign inflows from inclusion in the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index, which could drive a 10-15 basis point rally in government bond yields. For retail investors, Shah recommends staying in short to medium duration funds and favoring corporate bonds (up to 2-3 years) and SDLs (8-12 years) due to widened spreads offering attractive risk-reward. He cautions against aggressive long-duration bets unless the 10-year G-Sec reaches 7% or long bonds trade between 7.60-7.70%, signaling a tactical entry opportunity. The large government borrowing programme starting April 2026 warrants a cautious stance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 04:03 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/end-of-rate-cuts-ample-liquidity-why-short-end-yields-above-7-look-attractive-says-devang-shah/articleshow/128382447.cms)\n\n**Savings Banks' Average Deposit Interest Rate Rises to 3% Range, While Commercial Banks Hold at 2.8%-2.9%**\nThe average deposit interest rate at savings banks in South Korea has risen to the 3% range for the first time in six months, reaching 3.01% for one-year fixed deposits across 79 nationwide savings banks, according to the Savings Bank Association of Korea on February 16, 2026. This marks an increase of 0.08 percentage points from 2.93% one month prior and is the first time since August 2025 that the average has exceeded 3%. The rise follows a period of declining rates due to deteriorating financial health from real estate project financing (PF) defaults and prolonged economic stagnation, which had previously caused savings bank rates to fall below those of commercial banks. However, with capital shifting toward the stock market\u2014driven by an increase in 'debt investment' (borrowing to invest) activity\u2014savings banks have raised rates to retain deposits. As of the same date, 220 out of 307 fixed deposit products (72%) offered rates above 3% annually. Deposit outflows had previously driven savings bank deposits below 100 trillion won for the first time since June 2025, but the recent rate hike has helped stabilize inflows. Despite this, there has been no return to the past practice of high-interest promotional campaigns around holidays like Lunar New Year, which were common in previous years. In contrast, major commercial banks\u2014including KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Hana, Woori, and NH Nonghyup\u2014have maintained their one-year fixed deposit rates in the 2.8% to 2.9% range, with rates holding steady at the 2.5% level in late 2025 and rising only slightly to the 2.8%\u20132.9% range by the end of January 2026, after which they have remained unchanged.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 04:02 AM\nSource:[Chosun.com](https://www.chosun.com/economy/economy_general/2026/02/16/NIOHI5IGU5EKBLY32IANPUNQ2I/)\n\n**Worried about rising rates?

They argue that inflation, which peaked at nearly 8% in 2022, is now better contained, reducing the urgency for further rate hikes.

The CPI rose 2.4% year-on-year, below the forecast of 2.5%, and increased 0.2% month-on-month, below the expected 0.3%. Core CPI rose 2.5% year-on-year and 0.3% month-on-month, meeting forecasts. The decline in inflation data boosted expectations of additional Federal Reserve rate cuts, supporting equity markets.

The Nasdaq Composite declined 50 points to 22,546, marking its fourth consecutive day of losses. The S&P 500 rose 3 points to 6,836, ending four days of declines. Among S&P 500 sectors, seven of 11 advanced, with utilities leading at +2.7%, followed by real estate (+1.5%) and materials and healthcare in the +1.0% range. Communication services and technology declined by 0.8% and 0.5%, respectively. Of the 30 Dow components, 15 rose; Nike (NKE) led with a 3.3% gain, followed by UnitedHealth Group (UNH) at +3.1% and Walt Disney (DIS) at +3.0%. Visa (V) fell 3.1%, Apple (AAPL) dropped 2.3%, and Nvidia (NVDA) declined 2.2%. Outside the Dow, Applied Materials (AMAT) surged 8.1% on strong quarterly results and outlook, while Moderna (MRNA) rose 5.3% after exceeding earnings expectations. Pinterest (PINS) plunged 16.8% due to below-forecast revenue and weak forward guidance. Long-term interest rates fell to 4.05%, down 0.05 percentage points from the previous day. The USD/JPY traded around the 152 yen range on February 16 morning. The mixed market performance was supported by gains in select tech stocks like AMAT, despite the Nasdaq\u2019s decline.

This move is interpreted by the market as a sign of strong capital management, despite being limited to common shareholders. Concurrently, the exchange-traded preferred shares (AFGE), which pay quarterly interest at a rate of 4.500%, are approaching their next ex-date for interest payments on February 27, 2026. These long-dated securities, maturing in 2060, are sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates; a stable or declining interest rate environment supports their valuation. Recent inflation data have influenced broader bond markets and directly impacted AFGE\u2019s pricing. The company\u2019s creditworthiness is underpinned by its earnings power in the property and casualty insurance sector. Upcoming economic data releases will be critical in shaping market expectations for long-term interest rates and, consequently, the valuation of AFGE. A February 15, 2026, analysis from Aktien Check urges immediate action, stating that 'urgent action is required' for AFGE shareholders, though it does not clarify whether the recommendation is to buy or sell.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 09:51 PM\nSource:[Aktien Check](https://www.aktiencheck.de/news/Artikel-American_Financial_Group_Zinstermine-19474443)\n\n**RBA offers more rates call insight before jobs data**\nThe Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) will release the minutes from its February 2026 meeting, where it unanimously increased interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.85%, citing a resurgence in inflation and unexpectedly rapid consumer spending and business investment as key drivers. Governor Michelle Bullock has previously highlighted these factors but the minutes are expected to provide deeper insight into the board's decision-making process. Ahead of the release, NAB senior economist Taylor Nugent forecasts year-on-year wage growth of 3.4% for the final quarter of 2025, with a 0.8% quarterly increase driven by services sector growth and a 5-basis-point boost from aged care worker pay rises tied to the work value case. Wage price index growth has also been supported by public sector agreements incorporating catch-up pay. On Thursday, January 2026 labor force data is expected to show a rise in unemployment to 4.2% from 4.1% in December, with a projected 20,000-person increase, consistent with historical trends where January typically sees a 10\u201315 basis point rise in the unemployment rate, partially reversed in February due to job-attached but unemployed individuals. Meanwhile, Wall Street showed resilience after a prior decline, with the S&P 500 nearly flat, the Dow Jones rising 0.1%, and the Nasdaq slipping 0.2%. Australian share futures rose 0.29% to 11,215, while the S&P/ASX200 fell 1.39% to 8,917.6 and the All Ordinaries dropped 1.54% to 9,138.8 on Friday.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 01:02 AM\nSource:[Perth Now](https://www.perthnow.com.au/news/business/rba-offers-more-rates-call-insight-before-jobs-data-c-21643457)\n\n**Financing in 2026: Strategies for Businesses in a High-Rate Environment**\nThe article outlines financial strategies for businesses in Argentina amid persistently high interest rates, emphasizing that financing challenges are not solely about interest rates but also about business structure, including cost structure, margins, commercial policy, inventory turnover, and sales profile. The era of leveraging cheap financing and inflation to inflate profits has ended, as inflation has declined and margins have narrowed, returning business to its core fundamentals. Key financing tools include: SGR-backed checks with rates around 30%\u2014well below the Tamar\u2014and IVA exemptions on interest, reducing total cost; non-secured checks from large companies with even lower rates; electronic credit invoices, which can be discounted in pesos, dollar-linked, or hard dollars at rates of 10%-12% over 60-90 days; bursatile promissory notes (pap\u00e1s burs\u00e1tiles), which are flexible in denomination (pesos, dollar-linked, hard dollars, or commodity-linked), exempt from IVA and stamp duty, and do not affect bank credit limits; cauciones tomadoras (short-term collateralized instruments) offering one-day financing at rates between 30% and 35%, below bank overdrafts, requiring securities like bonds or shares but avoiding capital depletion; and negociable obligations (ON), which require SGR backing and are limited due to SGR caution, but offer tailored terms including grace periods, amortization, and maturities\u2014critical for businesses with predictable, well-structured cash flows. The article concludes that 2026 will be a challenging yet opportunity-rich year, urging businesses to plan financing early and strategically, with a focus on short-term tools now and readiness for longer-term financing when interest rates normalize. 'Financing well is now central to business strategy.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 09:58 AM\nSource:[mdz](https://www.mdzol.com/dinero/financiarse-2026-estrategias-empresas-un-escenario-tasas-altas-n1439250)\n\n**'4% Interest Rate Is Okay' \u2013 The Shift of Market Funds from Banks to Securities Firms Driven by Commercial Paper and IMA Products**\nSince the end of last year, mid-to-large-sized securities firms in South Korea have seen their newly launched large-scale commercial paper and Integrated Management Accounts (IMA) products sell out rapidly, triggering a 'money move' trend where funds are shifting from banks to securities companies. The total issuance capacity of these products by nine comprehensive financial investment securities firms, approved by the Financial Services Commission for productive finance transformation and venture capital supply, is estimated at approximately 140 trillion KRW, with about 75 trillion KRW already issued. These products offer fixed interest rates of 3-4% annually\u2014higher than bank rates\u2014with principal protection effectively guaranteed. As securities firms attract public funds through these products, banks are facing urgent concerns over deposit outflows. KB Financial Group noted in a January 10 executive workshop that 'the acceleration of the money move and concentration of wealth are rapidly changing the asset management environment,' while Hana Financial Group expressed concern that 'new products like IMA are not favorable for banks, and fund migration to securities firms is becoming routine.' Commercial banks are particularly vulnerable to outflows from non-interest-bearing checking accounts, which make up about 350 trillion KRW of the total 2,200 trillion KRW in bank deposits. According to Woo-jin Wi, head of the Financial 1 Division at Hanjin Credit Rating, banks may need to raise interest rates to defend deposits, though they have various non-interest defenses (such as penalties for early withdrawal). Meanwhile, savings banks\u2014already affected by the reduction in real estate project financing (PF) loans since 2024\u2014are now directly exposed to competition from securities firm commercial paper and IMA products. With shrinking lending portfolios, savings banks face a difficult choice: raising interest rates to retain deposits is impractical. Furthermore, securities firm commercial paper is included in the government\u2019s default option for pension fund investments, while savings bank deposits are not, leaving savings banks with few tools to retain customers. Wi emphasized that savings banks have lower customer loyalty than commercial banks, making their 'parking accounts' and other waiting funds highly susceptible to shifting toward securities firm products.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: January 12, 2026 06:40 AM\nSource:[\ud55c\uaca8\ub808\uc2e0\ubb38](https://www.hani.co.kr/arti/economy/finance/1239226.html)\n\n**Investors Flock to Securities Firms' Fixed-Rate and Parking-Type Products Amid Demand for Short-Term Returns**\nInvestors in South Korea are increasingly favoring securities firms' fixed-rate products, particularly 'commercial paper' and 'parking-type' accounts (CMA), driven by demand for short-term, low-risk assets to secure quick returns. According to the Korea Financial Investment Association, CMA account balances reached 100.6561 trillion won by December 23, 2025\u2014surpassing 100 trillion won for the first time, up 9.83 trillion won from 90.8273 trillion won in July. CMA accounts offer guaranteed daily interest rates with no restrictions on deposits or withdrawals, and typically provide higher annual yields (1\u20132%) than bank short-term deposits. The highest-yielding CMA product is Mirae Asset Securities' 'CMA-Repurchase Agreement (RP) Naver Account,' offering 2.50% for deposits under 10 million won and 1.95% for amounts above. Other top performers include Daeil Investment's RP-type CMA (2.40%) and Woori Investment's 'WooriWON CMA Note (Fixed-Rate)' (2.40% for under 10 million won, 2.20% above). These fixed-rate CMA products are protected under the Deposit Insurance Act, guaranteeing principal and interest up to 50 million won. For higher returns, investors are turning to securities-issued commercial paper, which guarantees principal and fixed returns at maturity (within one year). Key examples include Kiwoom Securities' special commercial paper (3.45% annual rate, sold out quickly), its standard product (3.1% annual rate), KB Securities (3.2%), Mirae Asset (3.05%), and NH Investment (3.05%). Experts recommend comparing special products from newly licensed securities firms\u2014such as Shinhan Investment and Hana Securities, which received licenses in 2025\u2014anticipating more options by early 2026.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: December 27, 2025 09:58 AM\nSource:[\uc778\ud130\ub137\ub274\uc2a4 \ud55c\uacbd\ub2f7\ucef4](https://www.hankyung.com/article/2025122672257)\n\n**Securities Firms' Commercial Paper Market Heats Up with 7 Firms Competing for Investor Interest**\nInvestor interest in securities firms' commercial paper has surged due to the government's strategy to expand venture capital. Commercial paper is a short-term financial product issued by securities firms based on their own credit, offering higher interest rates than bank deposits and savings. The funds raised are used for corporate finance and investment, supporting venture capital. The Financial Services Commission recently granted additional commercial paper issuance licenses to Shinhan Investment Securities and Hana Securities, increasing the number of licensed firms to seven, including Korea Investment Securities, Mirae Asset Securities, NH Investment Securities, KB Securities, and Kiwoom Securities. A review of four major securities firms (Korea Investment, Mirae Asset, NH Investment, KB) shows that the outstanding balance of commercial paper rose from 41.5 trillion won in the fourth quarter of last year to 48.5 trillion won by December 17, 2025\u2014a gain of 7 trillion won in one year. Kiwoom Securities' term-based commercial paper, launched on December 16, offers an annual yield of 3.45% (special offer), while standard products provide 3.1%. Minimum investment is 1 million won. KB Securities offers 3.2% annually on a 360-day basis, Mirae Asset and NH Investment offer 3.05%, and Korea Investment offers 2.9%. For investors seeking higher returns, savings-type commercial paper is gaining attention. Unlike term-based paper, which returns principal and interest at maturity, savings-type paper allows monthly contributions with interest accruing per deposit. Currently, Korea Investment, NH Investment, and KB Securities offer savings-type products: Korea Investment and NH Investment offer 4.35% annually, and KB Securities offers 4.00%. However, unlike bank deposits and savings, commercial paper is not covered by the Deposit Insurance Act.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: December 22, 2025 03:36 PM\nSource:[Chosunbiz](https://biz.chosun.com/stock/stock_general/2025/12/23/HA3TONTDGM2WKZBRGIZGEOLDMY/)\n\n**Investors Flee to Fixed-Rate Securities: Commercial Paper and RPs Amid Market Volatility**\nAmid rising stock market volatility, investors are increasingly turning to fixed-rate securities offered by securities firms, particularly short-term safe-haven products like commercial paper and repurchase agreements (RP). Future Value Securities raised interest rates on its commercial paper products by 0.10\u20130.35 percentage points starting December 2, 2025, with one-year term rates increasing from 2.70% to 3.05%, and shorter-term rates (9 months, 6 months, 3 months, and 1 month) also rising across the board. NH Investment Securities increased rates on some commercial paper by 0.25 percentage points, with its one-year personal product now at 3.05%. KB Securities and Korea Investment Securities offer one-year personal commercial paper at 3.0% and 2.90%, respectively. Commercial paper is a principal-guaranteed product where securities firms promise fixed returns at maturity (within one year), with no principal loss risk as long as the firm does not fail. Funds raised are invested in corporate loans, bonds, and corporate bonds. Competition among securities firms for repurchase agreement (RP) rates is also intense: Korea Investment Securities offers a 2.25% annual rate on its variable-term RPs and 2.35\u20132.50% on term RPs, while Future Value Securities offers 2.10% on variable-term and 2.25\u20132.55% on term RPs. RPs are short-term parking instruments with collateral such as government or corporate bonds, offering higher yields than comparable deposits. Korea Investment Securities' domestic RP balance surged 44% year-to-date, driven by demand. As the KOSPI index, which had risen 70% earlier in the year, stabilized around the 4,000 level, short-term capital has flowed into these fixed-rate securities. A private banking (PB) executive at a securities firm stated that interest in these products will remain strong until the stock market resumes a significant upward trend.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: December 04, 2025 08:40 AM\nSource:[\uc778\ud130\ub137\ub274\uc2a4 \ud55c\uacbd\ub2f7\ucef4](https://www.hankyung.com/article/2025120445871)\n\n**The AAA Conundrum**\nAccording to Wind statistics cited in the article, 1,185 corporate bonds were issued in China during the first eight months of 2025, and 85% of those issuers received an AAA rating \u2013 a sharp rise from the 51% proportion reported for 2016. The article likens the AAA rating to an \u2018entry ticket\u2019 for companies, drawing a parallel with the Qing\u2011era satire \u2018Rulin Waishi\u2019 where a \u2018ticket\u2019 allowed a scholar to sit the imperial examination. China\u2019s bond market is the world\u2019s second\u2011largest; the article reports that by the end of 2024 the market size exceeded 177 trillion yuan, while the stock market\u2019s total market value was over 85 trillion yuan. Corporate bonds are divided into interest\u2011rate bonds (government\u2011backed) and credit bonds, with a rating scale that ranges from C to AAA, plus or minus modifiers. Commercial banks and asset\u2011management firms are the main buyers of credit bonds, using the rating as a key criterion; asset\u2011manager Lin\u202fLing said the minimum acceptable rating for their clients is AA. The article quotes a senior staff member of a rating agency saying '\u539f\u6765\u8bc4\u7ea7\u662f\u2018\u5206\u7ea7\u68c0\u9a8c\u5238\u2019\uff0c\u73b0\u5728AAA\u53ef\u80fd\u90fd\u6210\u4e86\u2018\u5165\u573a\u5238\u2019\u3002' It also reports that a company paid 25\u202f\u4e07\u5143 to obtain an AA+ rating and that the rating process can be as fast as '\u4ece\u7b7e\u8ba2\u5408\u540c\u5230\u521d\u8bc4\uff0c\u6700\u5feb45\u5929'.

These instruments provide security and are essential for diversified portfolios. Government securities (G-Secs), issued by the central and state governments under RBI supervision, are considered risk-free and include treasury bills (91, 182, and 364 days) and dated securities. Treasury bills are zero-coupon, issued at a discount, and redeemed at face value. Corporate bonds, issued by public and private entities for business purposes, carry varying maturities (1\u201315 years) and default risk, reflected in credit ratings from AAA to D. Commercial paper (CP) is an unsecured, short-term instrument (7 days to 1 year) used for working capital. Fixed deposits (FDs) and small savings schemes are also cited as assured return instruments. The article emphasizes that debt investments support capital raising, economic growth, and portfolio diversification. It advises investors to align debt choices with their risk profiles and financial goals, recommending consultation with certified financial experts. The article notes that while debt instruments offer stability and income, they must be integrated into a broader financial plan.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 16, 2023 12:00 AM\nSource:[moneycontrol.com](https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/personal-finance/how-to-get-the-best-from-your-fixed-income-investments-11753991.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
