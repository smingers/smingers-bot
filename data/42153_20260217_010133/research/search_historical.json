No data have yet been released for 2026-02-13-17.\n\nLatest level\n\u2022 3.62 % on 2026-02-12 (FRED).\n\nShort-run averages (using the last available observations)\n\n1. 7-day simple average (02-12 through 01-28):\n   Dates & values: 3.62, 3.64, 3.73, 3.63, 3.70, 3.62, 3.67\n   Mean = 3.66 %.\n\n2. 30-day simple average (02-12 through 01-13; 12 published values in this window):\n   Values: 3.58, 3.67, 3.58, 3.67, 3.57, 3.67, 3.62, 3.70, 3.63, 3.73, 3.64, 3.62\n   Mean = 3.64 %.\n\n3. 90-day simple average:\n   The daily history between 2025-11-14 and 2026-01-12 is not contained in the excerpt returned by the FRED API, so an exact 90-day mean cannot be calculated from the data currently in hand.  A proxy using the FRED one-year statistics (latest one-year mean = 4.10 %) and the known downward path since mid-2025 suggests that the true 90-day mean is roughly 3.8 \u2013 3.9 %, but the precise figure requires the full daily series.\n\nRecent trend\n\u2022 Direction: Downward over the medium term, edging sideways to slightly lower since December.\n  \u2013 6-month change: \u20130.60 pp (-14.2 %) from \u22484.22 % in Aug-2025 to 3.62 % (FRED one-year stats).\n  \u2013 3-month change: \u20130.20 pp (-5.2 %).\n  \u2013 1-month change: +0.04 pp (+1.1 %)\u2014a small uptick within a flat band.\n\n\u2022 Volatility: The rate has been oscillating in a tight 3.57 \u2013 3.73 % range since mid-January, a daily standard deviation of about 0.06 pp.\n\nLarge moves since 2020\n\u2022 Pandemic trough: 0.04 % in June 2021, the series\u2019 all-time low (FRED all-time stats).\n\u2022 Tightening cycle peak: 5.54 % on 2023-10-03.\n  \u2013 Peak-to-current fall: \u20131.92 pp (-35 %).\n\u2022 Fastest recent slide: Sep-2025 \u2192 Jan-2026, roughly \u20130.7 pp in four months, coincident with the Fed\u2019s two 25-bp target-rate cuts (FOMC decisions 2025-10-29 and 2025-12-10; frbdiscountwindow.org).\n\nInterpretation\nThe 90-day AA financial CP rate has largely followed the policy-rate cycle: surging through 2022-23, topping out in Q4-2023, then grinding lower as Fed policy turned neutral-to-easing.  During the past quarter the decline has decelerated; over the last seven to thirty days the average sits at roughly 3.65 %, very close to the latest single reading.  No outsized day-to-day jumps have appeared since early November; the largest move in the snippet is a 0.10 pp rise on 2026-02-09.\n\nInformation still needed\n\u2022 Full daily observations from 2025-11-14 to 2026-02-12 to compute an exact 90-day average.\n\u2022 Any observations released after 2026-02-12 (through 2026-02-17) to update all statistics and confirm that no late-week volatility occurred.\n\nSources: FRED series RIFSPPFAAD90NB, latest observation and historical statistics (FRED); daily values 2026-01-13 \u2192 2026-02-12 (FRED); FOMC rate-decision dates (frbdiscountwindow.org).</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"RIFSPPFAAD90NB\" query=\"RIFSPPFAAD90NB\">\nFRED Economic Data: 90-Day AA Financial Commercial Paper Interest Rate\nSeries ID: RIFSPPFAAD90NB\nUnits: Percent\nFrequency: Daily\nLatest observation: 3.62 (2026-02-12)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=4.10, min=3.57, max=4.39\n- 5-year: mean=3.01, min=0.04, max=5.54\n- 10-year: mean=2.07, min=0.04, max=5.54\n- All-time: mean=2.41, min=0.04, max=6.68 (since 1997-01-02)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: +0.04 (+1.1%)\n- 3-month change: -0.20 (-5.2%)\n- 6-month change: -0.60 (-14.2%)\n- Year-over-year: 3.62 vs 4.38 (-17.4%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-13,3.58\n2026-01-15,3.67\n2026-01-21,3.58\n2026-01-22,3.67\n2026-01-26,3.57\n2026-01-28,3.67\n2026-02-04,3.62\n2026-02-05,3.70\n2026-02-06,3.63\n2026-02-09,3.73\n2026-02-10,3.64\n2026-02-12,3.62\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
