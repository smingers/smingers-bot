Factual: specific percentage, median nightly price $62. **Quality:** Travel industry report via reliable source, but dated (2 months old). **Relevance:** Tourism interest indicator, but measures accommodation searches, not general "el paso" searches.

**Outside View Analysis Sources:**

The outside view correctly identifies the Feb 11 spike (value=100) from the FAA airspace closure, subsequent rapid decay to 19 by Feb 17, and 90-day base rate showing 95% of 11-day windows have ≤3 point changes. The 90-day mean of 18.4 (std dev 9.0) provides solid statistical grounding.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Google Trends historical pattern:** 95% of 11-day windows show ≤3 point change (strong statistical base rate from objective data source)
- **Current value at historical mean:** Feb 17 value of 19 vs. 90-day mean of 18.4 indicates mean reversion complete after Feb 11 spike
- **Post-spike decay pattern:** Clear 7-day stabilization (Feb 12-17) around 18-20 after spike decay

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Lack of scheduled national catalysts:** No confirmed major events, hearings, or announcements in Feb 17-28 window that would drive national search interest
- **Local event on Feb 28:** Lunar New Year Festival (3,500+ expected based on 2025 attendance) occurs on measurement date, could add 1-2 points of local interest
- **High wind warnings (Feb 18):** Extreme weather with 80 mph gusts could drive regional searches, but timing (Feb 18) is early in window and unlikely to sustain through Feb 28

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Lingering airspace closure confusion:** Feb 15 article documents social media panic, but describes resolution of false rumors, not ongoing concern
- **Meta data center announcement:** $1.5B investment is significant economically but announced previously; Feb 16 policy discussion is procedural
- **Travel destination ranking:** 191% increase in accommodation searches is impressive but measures different metric (vacation planning vs. general interest) and is 2-month-old data

**Evidence NOT supporting change:**
- Gas rate hike, layoffs, real estate trends: All local economic stories with no national resonance
- Cartel drone analysis: Retrospective analysis of Feb 10 event already captured in Feb 11 spike

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 11 days (Feb 17 to Feb 28, 2026)

**Current trajectory:** Value has stabilized at 18-20 for 6 consecutive days after completing decay from Feb 11 spike. This suggests equilibrium at historical mean.

**If timeframe halved (5-6 days to Feb 22-23):**
- Would increase confidence in "Doesn't change" to ~92-95%
- Less time for unexpected immigration/border news to break
- Would miss Feb 28 Lunar New Year Festival entirely
- High wind event (Feb 18) would be proportionally more significant but still unlikely to sustain

**If timeframe doubled (22 days to mid-March):**
- Would decrease confidence in "Doesn't change" to ~70-75%
- Substantially higher probability of immigration/border news catalyst emerging
- March 31 HGS layoffs would enter window (though small-scale)
- More time for Meta data center story to develop national angle
- Multiple news cycles increase tail risk of unexpected events

## (d) Justification

**Base rate anchor:** 95% of 11-day windows show ≤3 point change, with 5% increases and 0% decreases.

**Key adjustments from base rate:**

1. **Mean reversion complete (+2% to "Doesn't change"):** The current value of 19 is essentially at the 90-day mean of 18.4, and the 6-day stabilization pattern strongly suggests the Feb 11 spike's impact has fully dissipated. This reduces probability of continued directional movement.

2. **Feb 28 Lunar New Year Festival (-3% from "Doesn't change," +3% to "Increases"):** While local events historically don't move national trends significantly, this festival occurs on the exact measurement date (Feb 28). The 3,500+ expected attendance could generate enough local search activity to add 1-2 points. However, exceeding the 3-point threshold (requiring value >22) would need the festival to generate unusually high interest or coincide with another factor.

3. **High wind warnings Feb 18 (-1% from "Doesn't change," +1% to "Increases"):** Extreme weather (80 mph gusts) with fire danger could drive regional searches on Feb 18-19, but unlikely to sustain through Feb 28. Historical pattern shows weather events cause brief spikes that decay quickly.

4. **Immigration/border storyline tail risk (-2% from "Doesn't change," +2% to "Increases"):** The cartel drone incident created the Feb 11 spike, and the issue remains "live" per outside view analysis. However, no specific catalyst is scheduled in the Feb 17-28 window. The Breitbart analysis documents ongoing policy developments but doesn't indicate imminent newsworthy events. Probability of major breaking news in this specific 11-day window: ~10%.

5. **Asymmetry in base rate (0% decreases observed):** The historical data shows no 11-day windows with >3 point decreases, suggesting structural floor around 16-18. However, with value at 19 and Feb 28 local event, downward movement below 16 is extremely unlikely.

**Net adjustments:**
- Base rate: Doesn't change 95%, Increases 5%, Decreases 0%
- After adjustments: Doesn't change 91%, Increases 9%, Decreases 0%

However, I need to account for genuine uncertainty about the Feb 28 festival's impact. If it generates moderate local buzz, the value could reach 21-22 (still "Doesn't change"). If it generates unusually high interest OR coincides with any immigration news, it could exceed 22 ("Increases"). The probability distribution should reflect this uncertainty.

## Probability Calibration

**Status quo outcome:** Value remains 18-20, resolving as "Doesn't change." This is strongly supported by:
- Mean reversion dynamics (already at historical mean)
- 95% base rate for stability
- Lack of scheduled national catalysts
- 6-day stabilization pattern

**Scenario for "Increases" (value >22 on Feb 28):**
- Lunar New Year Festival generates unusually high local interest (3-4 points) - probability ~15%
- Immigration/border news breaks during window (2-5 points) - probability ~10%
- High wind event causes sustained regional concern (1-2 points) - probability ~5%
- Combination of festival + minor news item - probability ~5%
- **Combined probability: ~20-25%** (accounting for overlap, using ~22%)

**Scenario for "Decreases" (value <16 on Feb 28):**
- Would require value to drop from 19 to 15 or below
- No negative catalysts identified
- Base rate shows 0% of 11-day windows with >3 point decreases
- Feb 28 festival provides upward, not downward, pressure
- **Combined probability: ~1-2%**

**Calibration check:**
- 22% for "Increases" feels appropriate given: (a) Feb 28 festival on measurement date, (b) ~10% tail risk of immigration news, (c) weather event early in window
- 1% for "Decreases" reflects near-impossibility given structural floor and Feb 28 event
- 77% for "Doesn't change" reflects strong base rate minus realistic scenarios for exceeding 3-point threshold

**Confidence assessment:** The 77% for "Doesn't change" represents 3.4:1 odds, which feels calibrated to the evidence. The base rate of 95% (19:1 odds) is being adjusted downward primarily due to the Feb 28 festival occurring on the measurement date itself—a specific circumstance not fully captured in the historical base rate. If the festival were on Feb 21 instead, I would be closer to 85-90% for "Doesn't change."

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will El Paso Google Trends value on Feb 28 be within 3 points of Feb 17 value (19)? "Doesn't change" if 16-22; "Increases" if >22; "Decreases" if <16.

2. **Base rate:** Outside view established 95% "Doesn't change," 5% "Increases," 0% "Decreases" from 11-day window analysis. My final prediction (77%/22%/1%) represents moderate adjustment from base rate, justified by Feb 28 festival on measurement date and ~10% immigration news tail risk.

3. **Consistency check:** Most likely = "Doesn't change" (77%); Least likely = "Decreases" (1%). This aligns with mean reversion dynamics, lack of negative catalysts, and Feb 28 festival providing slight upward pressure. Makes sense.

4. **Five most significant pieces of evidence:**
   - Current value (19) at 90-day mean (18.4) after 6-day stabilization = strong mean reversion signal
   - 95% base rate for ≤3 point change in 11-day windows = powerful statistical anchor
   - Lunar New Year Festival on Feb 28 (measurement date) with 3,500+ expected = modest upward pressure
   - No scheduled national immigration/border catalysts in window = reduces spike probability
   - Zero observed >3 point decreases in base rate = structural floor around 16-18

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Major immigration/border news breaks Feb 24-27 (e.g., large-scale enforcement action, policy announcement, or incident at El Paso facilities), coinciding with Feb 28 festival, driving value to 25-30. This would make my 22% for "Increases" look too conservative. However, absent specific intelligence about scheduled events, I cannot justify higher probability based on pure speculation. If this occurred, I would shift to ~35-40% "Increases."

6. **Status quo:** The world changes slowly. Current value of 19 has been stable for 6 days. The 11-day timeframe is short. Feb 28 festival is a known, modest factor. Strong case for slight nudge toward status quo, but I've already adjusted from 95% base rate to 77%, which feels appropriately conservative given the Feb 28 timing.

7. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, are between 0-100, no % signs.
