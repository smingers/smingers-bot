Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**PBS NewsHour (Feb 11, 2026):** High-quality national news source documenting the FAA airspace closure over El Paso on Feb 10-11. Reports 27,000+ drone detections at southern border in last 6 months of 2024, and quotes Transportation Secretary Duffy claiming cartel drone incursion (threat neutralized). Rep. Escobar contradicts this explanation. Factual information: closure occurred, was lifted within hours, caused flight disruptions. Opinion: Escobar's skepticism about official explanation.

**The Guardian (Feb 11, 2026):** Reputable international news source covering same airspace closure. Reports 14 flights canceled, 13 delayed. Mayor Johnson called decision "unnecessary" and criticized lack of coordination. Rep. Escobar and Ciudad Juárez Mayor Cuéllar both stated they had no information confirming drone incursions. Factual: specific flight disruptions, timeline. Opinion: local officials' criticism of federal handling.

**Spectrum Local News (Feb 16, 2026):** Local news covering wider impacts of airspace closure. Reports medical evacuation diversions and surgical equipment delays. UMC El Paso statement confirms they remained operational. Factual: operational impacts on healthcare. Opinion: Mayor's characterization as "unnecessary distraction."

**El Paso Times (Feb 4, 2026):** Local entertainment calendar listing events through February. Factual listing of concerts, shows, bull riding event (Feb 21), and other local entertainment. No analysis or predictions.

**El Paso Events Calendar (Feb 16, 2026):** Generic promotional calendar page with no specific event details for the forecast window.

**City of El Paso Events (Feb 28, 2026 event):** Official city source describing Lunar New Year Festival on Feb 28, 2026. Reports 3,500+ visitors in 2025. Factual: scheduled major public event on final day of forecast window.

**Agent Report:** Comprehensive synthesis identifying immigration/detention issues at Fort Bliss, FAA closure fallout, and scheduled local events. Notes immigration storyline is "live" and could reignite. Assessment: entertainment events historically insufficient to move national needle; immigration/detention most plausible catalyst for spike. Quality: well-reasoned synthesis with appropriate caveats about information gaps.

**Google Trends Data:** Objective data showing current value of 19 (Feb 17), with massive spike to 100 on Feb 11 (airspace closure), then decay back toward baseline. 90-day mean: 18.4, std dev: 9.0. Base rate analysis: 95% of 11-day windows show ≤3 point change.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **All 11-day windows for "el paso" searches (last 90 days):** Most directly relevant. Shows 95% stability (≤3 point change), 5% increases, 0% decreases.
2. **Post-major-news-spike decay patterns:** The Feb 11 spike (100) has decayed to 19 by Feb 17. Question is whether it continues decaying, stabilizes, or reverses.
3. **Local event impact on national searches:** Historical pattern shows local entertainment/sports events don't move national Google Trends significantly.
4. **Immigration/border news cycles:** When El Paso enters national news via immigration/border issues, searches spike dramatically (as seen Feb 11).

**Most suitable reference class:** The 11-day window base rate (95% no change) combined with post-spike decay analysis, adjusted for specific context of scheduled events and ongoing immigration storyline.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 11 days (Feb 17-28, 2026)

**Historical patterns:**
- Current value (Feb 17): 19
- Need to predict Feb 28 value
- Recent pattern shows rapid decay from Feb 11 spike: 100→36→23→21→18→20→19
- Pre-spike baseline (Feb 1-10): consistently 16-18
- The decay appears to be approaching the historical baseline of ~18.4

**Key dates in window:**
- Feb 21: Bull riding event (local impact only)
- Feb 28: Lunar New Year Festival (3,500+ expected, but local event)
- No scheduled national news events identified

## (d) Justification

The Google Trends data shows El Paso search interest spiked dramatically to 100 on Feb 11 due to the FAA airspace closure controversy, then rapidly decayed back toward the historical baseline of ~18. By Feb 17 (current date), the value has returned to 19, essentially at the 90-day mean of 18.4.

The base rate analysis is compelling: in 95% of 11-day windows over the past 90 days, the value changed by ≤3 points. This suggests strong mean reversion tendencies for this search term.

Looking forward to Feb 28:
- **Scheduled local events** (bull riding Feb 21, Lunar New Year Feb 28): The agent report correctly notes these historically don't move national search interest significantly. The Lunar New Year festival, while drawing 3,500+ locally, occurs on Feb 28 itself—the measurement date—so any impact would be captured in that day's value.
- **Immigration/detention storyline**: While the agent identifies this as a "live" issue that could reignite, there are no scheduled hearings, announcements, or known catalysts in the Feb 17-28 window. The FAA closure investigation could surface, but timing is uncertain.
- **Decay dynamics**: The value has stabilized around 18-20 for the past 6 days (Feb 12-17), suggesting the spike's decay is complete.

The most likely scenario is continued stability around the historical mean of 18-19. A value of 19 on Feb 17 changing to 16-22 on Feb 28 would all resolve as "Doesn't change" (within 3 points). An "Increase" would require Feb 28 value >22; a "Decrease" would require <16.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate of 95% stability in 11-day windows is my primary anchor. However, I must adjust for:

1. **Post-spike positioning**: We're measuring from a point (19) that's already returned to baseline after a major spike. This suggests stability rather than continued movement.

2. **Scheduled events**: The Feb 28 Lunar New Year festival could add 1-2 points of local interest, but unlikely to exceed the 3-point threshold for "Increase."

3. **Tail risk of immigration news**: While no specific catalyst is scheduled, the immigration/detention storyline remains active. However, the probability of a major breaking story in this specific 11-day window is low (<10%).

4. **Asymmetry in outcomes**: The base rate shows 5% increases, 0% decreases over 11-day windows. This suggests slight upward bias, though the sample may be influenced by the recent spike.

5. **Mean reversion**: At 19, we're essentially at the long-term mean (18.4), making large moves in either direction less likely.

Given the 95% base rate for stability, the lack of scheduled national catalysts, and mean reversion dynamics, I estimate:
- "Doesn't change": 85-90% (slightly below base rate due to Feb 28 festival and tail risk of immigration news)
- "Increases": 10-15% (small probability of immigration news breaking OR Lunar New Year festival pushing above threshold)
- "Decreases": 0-5% (very low probability given upward bias in base rate and scheduled local event on Feb 28)

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 12%
Doesn't change: 86%
Decreases: 2%
