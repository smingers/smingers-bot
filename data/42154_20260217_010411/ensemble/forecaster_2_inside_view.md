**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Severe weather warnings (Feb 17-18)**: Multiple sources confirm high winds (70-80 mph gusts), critical fire danger, and extended forecast coverage. Weather emergencies historically drive local search interest as residents seek updates. The warnings cover Feb 17-18, early in our forecast window.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Gas rate hike controversy**: Local political story with direct household impact ($3-11/month increases). Could drive local searches but unlikely to create sustained national interest.
- **Meta data center policy**: $1.5B investment is significant but likely already absorbed into baseline interest.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Routine cultural events**: Coin show, Broadway tour, concerts are normal tourism/entertainment activities.
- **Layoffs**: 92 jobs is relatively small scale.
- **Travel destination ranking**: Reflects 2026-wide interest, not specific to our 11-day window.

**Critical Observation:**
The Feb 10-11 airport closure/drone incident already occurred and created the spike to 100 on Feb 11. Current value is 19 (Feb 16), showing rapid mean reversion. The retrospective analysis article won't reignite that interest.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Forecast window:** 11 days (Feb 17-28, 2026)
**Current date:** Feb 17, 2026
**Resolution:** Compares Feb 28 value to Feb 17 value

The question asks whether interest will change by >3 points over these 11 days. We're forecasting from the start of the window.

**If timeframe were halved (5-6 days):** Shorter windows reduce variance; status quo would be even more likely. The severe weather event (Feb 17-18) would dominate the entire window, potentially causing a small uptick.

**If timeframe were doubled (22 days):** Longer windows increase probability of unexpected events. More time for new news cycles, though historical data shows even major events (airport closure) revert quickly.

**(d) Justification:**

**Base rate from outside view:** 92% "Doesn't change", 4% "Increases", 4% "Decreases"

**Key factors for adjustment:**

1. **Severe weather event (Feb 17-18):** This is the most significant near-term factor. High winds with 70-80 mph gusts and critical fire danger could drive searches if:
   - Fires actually break out
   - Significant property damage occurs
   - Regional/national media coverage ensues
   
   However, weather warnings alone typically don't create sustained search spikes unless actual disasters occur. The warnings cover only the first 2 days of our 11-day window.

2. **Recent mean reversion:** The current value (19) is already back to the 90-day mean (18.4) after the Feb 11 spike. This demonstrates strong gravitational pull toward baseline.

3. **No scheduled major events:** Unlike the airport closure (unexpected emergency), there are no scheduled events in the forecast window likely to drive significant interest. The Lunar New Year festival on Feb 28 drew 3,500 people last year—too small to move national search trends.

4. **Historical volatility:** In 90 days, only ONE 11-day window saw >3 point increase (5%), and ZERO saw >3 point decrease (0%). This suggests extreme stability except for rare shocks.

**Adjustment rationale:**

The severe weather warnings represent a **moderate-probability, low-magnitude** risk of increased search interest. If fires break out or significant damage occurs, we could see a modest uptick. However:
- Weather events are geographically localized
- The warnings are preventative, not reactive to actual disaster
- Even if searches increase Feb 17-18, there are 10 more days for reversion
- Historical data shows rapid mean reversion even after major events

I'll make a **modest upward adjustment** to "Increases" (from 4% to 12%) to account for weather-related search risk, while keeping "Doesn't change" dominant. The "Decreases" probability stays very low given zero historical precedent in the reference class.

**Probability Calibration:**

Starting from base rates: 4% Increases, 92% Doesn't change, 4% Decreases

**Adjustments:**
- Severe weather risk: +8% to "Increases" (total 12%)
- Strong mean reversion tendency: +3% to "Doesn't change" (total 95%)
- Subtract 10% from "Doesn't change" to fund the above
- Keep "Decreases" at minimal 3% (no evidence for decline, but avoiding zero)

However, this doesn't sum correctly. Let me recalibrate:

- **Increases:** Base 4% + 8% weather risk = 12%
- **Decreases:** Base 4% - 1% (no decline evidence) = 3%
- **Doesn't change:** 100% - 12% - 3% = 85%

This reflects:
- ~1-in-8 chance severe weather drives >3 point increase
- ~1-in-33 chance of unexpected decline
- ~5-in-6 chance status quo continues

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Feb 28 Google Trends value for "el paso" differ from Feb 17 value by >3 points? Increases if >3 higher, Decreases if >3 lower, else Doesn't change.

2. **Base rate alignment:** Outside view was 92% Doesn't change, 4% each tail. My 85-12-3 distribution represents modest shift toward "Increases" based on weather risk while maintaining strong status quo bias.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = Doesn't change (85%); Least likely = Decreases (3%). Makes sense given strong historical mean reversion and no evidence for decline.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - High wind warnings Feb 17-18 with fire danger (factual, NWS)
   - Current value 19 already at 90-day mean 18.4 (factual, Google Trends)
   - Zero historical 11-day declines >3 points in 90 days (factual, data)
   - Only 5% historical 11-day increases >3 points (factual, data)
   - Feb 11 spike to 100 reverted to 19 within 5 days (factual, Google Trends)

5. **Blind spot:** Severe fires break out Feb 17-18 causing major damage/evacuations, driving sustained regional/national media coverage. This could push Feb 28 value to 30-40 range, making "Increases" correct. Would shift to ~30% Increases, 67% Doesn't change, 3% Decreases.

6. **Status quo:** Strong mean reversion observed. Current volatility is low (back to baseline). 11-day window favors stability. My 85% status quo probability appropriately reflects this.

7. **Technical check:** 12 + 85 + 3 = 100 ✓

Probabilities: [12, 85, 3]
