Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis:**

**Google Trends Historical Data (Feb 17, 2026):**
- Most reliable source: direct quantitative data from the measurement system that will determine question resolution
- Shows current value of 19 on Feb 17, 2026
- Critical observation: Massive spike to 100 on Feb 11, 2026, followed by rapid decay (36→23→21→18→20→19)
- 90-day baseline: mean 18.4, std dev 9.0
- Base rate finding: 95% of 11-day windows show ≤3 point changes

**PBS News & The Guardian (Feb 11, 2026):**
- High-quality national news sources reporting on the FAA airspace closure incident
- Factual: FAA closed El Paso airspace for "10 days" then reversed within hours on Feb 11
- This event clearly caused the Feb 11 spike to 100
- Expert opinions from Mayor Johnson and Rep. Escobar expressing confusion and criticism
- The event is now 6 days in the past from our Feb 17 starting point

**El Paso Times & Spectrum News (Feb 4-16, 2026):**
- Local news covering routine entertainment events and aftermath of airspace closure
- Factual: Multiple concerts, shows scheduled throughout February
- No evidence these local events drive national search interest

**City of El Paso Events (Feb 28, 2026):**
- Factual: Lunar New Year Festival scheduled for Feb 28 (end of forecast window)
- Historical attendance: ~3,500 people in 2025
- This is a local event unlikely to generate national search interest

**Agent Report:**
- Synthesizes immigration/detention concerns at Fort Bliss
- Identifies potential triggers: further detainee deaths, congressional hearings, DHS announcements
- Assessment: Immigration storyline is "live" but unpredictable
- Notes entertainment events are local-scale only
- Key insight: The Feb 11 spike was immigration/border-security related (airspace closure)

(b) **Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **11-day windows in El Paso Google Trends history** - Most directly applicable
2. **Post-spike decay patterns** - Relevant given we're starting 6 days after a major spike
3. **Local event impact on national search interest** - Less relevant as historical data shows minimal impact

**Selected reference class:** The 90-day historical data showing 11-day windows is most suitable. However, we must adjust for the specific context: we're measuring from Feb 17 (value 19) after a major news event spike that peaked Feb 11 (value 100).

(c) **Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction window:** 11 days (Feb 17 to Feb 28, 2026)

**Current context (Feb 17):**
- Starting value: 19
- We are 6 days post-spike (Feb 11: value 100)
- Decay pattern observed: 100→36→23→21→18→20→19
- The value has stabilized near baseline (90-day mean: 18.4)

**Historical patterns:**
- Base rate: 95% of 11-day windows show ≤3 point change
- 5% show increases >3 points
- 0% show decreases >3 points
- Recent 7-day average (33.9) is inflated by the Feb 11 spike; excluding that outlier, the trend is flat

**Key observation:** The spike event (airspace closure) is fully resolved and in the past. The decay back to baseline is complete by Feb 17.

(d) **Justification:**

The Google Trends data shows El Paso search interest has returned to baseline (19) after the Feb 11 airspace closure spike. The value of 19 is very close to the 90-day mean of 18.4, indicating complete normalization.

For the forecast window (Feb 17-28):
- **No major national news events are scheduled** that would replicate the Feb 11 spike
- The Lunar New Year Festival on Feb 28 is a local event (3,500 attendees) that historically doesn't move national search interest
- Entertainment events (concerts, sports) are routine and local-scale
- Immigration/detention storyline remains a potential wildcard, but no specific triggers are scheduled

The base rate strongly favors stability: 95% of 11-day windows show ≤3 point changes. Starting from 19, the "Doesn't change" band is 16-22.

**Risk factors for change:**
- **Increase:** Unexpected immigration news, another detainee death, congressional hearing announcement, or FAA investigation developments could spike interest. However, these are unpredictable and the base rate suggests only 5% probability.
- **Decrease:** Given the value is already at baseline and historical data shows 0% of windows with >3 point decreases, a drop below 16 is highly unlikely.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate of 95% for "Doesn't change" is compelling, but I must consider:

1. **Recent volatility:** The Feb 11 spike demonstrates El Paso can quickly become national news, though such events are rare (only 5% of windows show increases >3)

2. **Decay completion:** The value has fully returned to baseline, reducing probability of further decrease

3. **Scheduled events:** All identified events are local-scale; none have historical precedent for moving national search interest

4. **Unpredictable triggers:** Immigration/border issues could flare up, but without specific scheduled catalysts, this remains low probability within an 11-day window

5. **Tethering to established distributions:** The 95%/5%/0% base rate from historical data is a strong anchor

**Calibration adjustments:**
- The base rate slightly underweights the "live" immigration storyline that could produce another spike
- However, the 11-day window is relatively short for unpredictable events to materialize
- Starting from baseline (19) rather than mid-spike reduces volatility risk

My calibrated view: The base rate is approximately correct, with slight upward adjustment to "Increases" probability given the active immigration narrative, and corresponding reduction to "Doesn't change."

Outside View Prediction:
Write your final probabilities as whole percentages for the options in this order ['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']:

Increases: 10%
Doesn't change: 89%
Decreases: 1%
