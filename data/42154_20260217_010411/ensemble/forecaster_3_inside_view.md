Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase, <30 words)
Between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-28 (US, query “el paso”, fixed 2026-01-29 to 2026-02-28), compare Feb 28 value vs Feb 17: >+3 = Increases; within ±3 = Doesn’t change; <-3 = Decreases.

(a) Source analysis (what each source says, quality/date)
- Google Trends (given, Feb 16-17 context): Directly tied to resolution; shows post–Feb 11 spike decay back near baseline (~19). Highest quality; closest in time.
- ElPaso.events calendar (Feb 16, 2026): Promotional listings; no quantitative reach/attention data; weak for national search interest.
- VisitElPaso.com events calendar (ongoing, viewed Feb 2026): Official tourism listings (coin show, Broadway tour dates, etc.). Reliable for “events exist,” but weak for predicting US-wide search volume shifts.
- Eventbrite “I Love El Paso 2026” (ended Feb 12): Confirms a small arts event occurred; low likely impact after it ended.
- NY Post Hillary Clinton migration comments (Feb 15, 2026): Credible that comments were made, but not El Paso-specific; only indirect relevance (border narrative ambient).
- CFR asylum policy explainer (Mar 2023): High-quality but stale and not predictive for a Feb 2026 short window.
- Guardian El Paso air pollution/border crossing upgrade (Feb 2024): High-quality but stale; mostly background.
AskNews/local & wire items (Feb 15-16, 2026):
- KFOX: City of El Paso challenges Texas Gas rate hike (Feb 16): Reliable local TV; clearly factual civic dispute; likely local interest only.
- KFOX: El Paso City Council data center policy framework tied to Meta AI data center (Feb 16): Reliable local; factual; could generate business/tech interest, but mostly regional.
- NWS/WFO El Paso warnings/watch (Feb 16 for Feb 18): High credibility (weather service/wire). Predicts potentially extreme winds (gusts up to ~70–80 mph) + fire danger; could drive a short-term search bump if impacts occur.
- KVIA: weather story about strong winds returning (Feb 15): Local media, consistent with NWS; supportive but secondary.
- Diario.mx: 92 remote call center layoffs in El Paso starting ~Mar 31 (Feb 16): Plausible local reporting; timing mostly outside window; likely local.
- Breitbart analysis: cartel drone incursion / Feb 10 airspace shutdown (Feb 16): Partisan framing, but the underlying event (airspace disruption) is consistent with known earlier spike; relevance is whether follow-on coverage reignites attention.
- Diario.mx opinion column about false airport closure panic (Feb 15): Commentary/opinion; indicates rumor cycle existed; low reliability for predicting broader US searches.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighing factors vs criteria)
Strong evidence:
- Historical/structural Google Trends behavior from the outside view: most 11-day windows stay within ±3; post-spike levels already re-stabilized near baseline by Feb 17. This strongly favors “Doesn’t change.”

Moderate evidence:
- NWS High Wind Watch / fire-weather setup (Feb 18): credible mechanism for a transient, locally intense news cycle (blowing dust, road closures, wildfire). If impacts are severe and picked up by national outlets, that can push “el paso” searches up by >3. Uncertain whether impacts materialize or go national.

Weak evidence:
- Local governance/economy stories (gas rate hike challenge, data center framework, layoffs): can move local search behavior, but usually not enough to move US-wide “el paso” by >3 in a locked 31-day window.
- Event calendars (coin show, Broadway tour, etc.): typically too routine/local to move national Google Trends by >3.
- Drone/airspace follow-on commentary: could rekindle attention, but absent a new incident, this is mostly “afterstory” rather than a fresh trigger.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Window length: 11 days (Feb 17 → Feb 28).
- If halved (~5–6 days): even more likely “Doesn’t change” (less time for a shock event; weather bump would need to land exactly on/near the end point to change Feb 28 vs Feb 17 by >3).
- If doubled (~22 days): higher chance of an exogenous spike (border incident, extreme weather, major crime/security story), raising “Increases” probability materially.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustments from outside-view base rate)
Outside view base rate (given): Increases 10 / Doesn’t change 89 / Decreases 1.

What changes my view (small-to-moderate nudge):
- The most decision-relevant new/near-term catalyst is the Feb 18 wind/fire weather risk. Extreme winds and fire danger sometimes produce notable regional/national coverage (I-10 dust pileups, airport delays, wildfires), which could elevate searches for “el paso.” This modestly increases tail risk on the upside during the window.
- However, absent confirmation that the weather actually causes major disruption, the status quo remains: the prior huge spike has already decayed and stabilized by Feb 17, and routine local news/events rarely moves US query interest by >3 at the endpoint (Feb 28).
- “Decreases” remains very low because (i) starting level is already near baseline and (ii) the historical reference class found essentially no >3 drops in similar windows.

Net: slight shift from “Doesn’t change” toward “Increases,” with “Decreases” still a small residual.

Probability calibration
- Status quo (flat around baseline): dominant.
- Upside shock (weather impacts; new border/drone incident; national pickup): low but non-trivial in an 11-day window.
- Downside drift >3: unlikely.

Checklist:
1) Criteria/options aligned? Yes: compare Feb 28 vs Feb 17 on the fixed-range Trends page; thresholds ±3.
2) Outside view base rate used? Yes: anchored on [10, 89, 1].
3) Consistency check: Most likely = Doesn’t change; Least likely = Decreases; consistent with stable baseline and asymmetric spike risk.
4) Key evidence (each <20 words):
   - Trends already re-stabilized near baseline by Feb 17 after the Feb 11 spike.
   - Historical 11-day windows: overwhelming mass within ±3.
   - NWS forecasts very strong winds/fire danger Feb 18 (possible disruption-driven search bump).
   - Local civic/economic stories unlikely to move US-wide “el paso” by >3.
5) Blind spot: A fresh border/drone/airport incident or major wildfire/dust disaster near Feb 28 causing national coverage.
6) Status quo outcome considered? Yes; I keep “Doesn’t change” clearly dominant.
7) Technicalities: probabilities sum to 100; integers; no % signs.

Probabilities: [13, 85, 2]
