Analysis
--------------------------------------------------
1. Paraphrased resolution rule  
Compare Google Trends value for “el paso” on 17 Feb 2026 vs 28 Feb 2026 (URL-locked Jan 29–Feb 28 range).  
• > +3 → “Increases” • between –3 and +3 → “Doesn’t change” • < –3 → “Decreases”.

2. Outside-view base rate (11-day windows, past 90 days)  
Increases 5 % Doesn’t change 93 % Decreases 2 %.

--------------------------------------------------
(a) Source analysis (quality & factual content)

1. KFOX (16 Feb 26) – City challenges gas rate hike.  Local government facts; reliable regional TV site; impact on national searches very small.  
2. The Facts / NWS bulletins (16 Feb 26) – High-wind / fire-weather watches.  Straight data from NWS, high factual reliability, usually low national traction.  
3. KFOX (16 Feb 26) – Data-center framework discussion.  Municipal agenda notice; factual; niche interest.  
4. Breitbart (16 Feb 26) – Analysis of 10 Feb drone incursion.  National partisan site, mixes fact (NOTAM, airport stop) with opinion; had wider pickup earlier in Feb.  
5. Misc. event calendars (Visit El Paso, Eventbrite, etc.).  Factual times/places of local shows; low reach outside region.  
6. Guardian 2024 pollution piece, CFR 2023 asylum piece, older economic pieces.  Historic background; no bearing on 17-28 Feb 26 search volume.

All sources are either local news/event notices (likely weak drivers) or follow-up commentary on the 10 Feb air-space shutdown (already one week old).

--------------------------------------------------
(b) Evidence weighting for the forecast window

Strong evidence (none).  
Moderate evidence  
• Breitbart + earlier PBS/Guardian pieces show drone-incursion story had national coverage 10–15 Feb; news cycle already cooling (moderate downward momentum).  
Weak evidence  
• NWS high-wind watches (can create short TV mentions but seldom move Google interest >3).  
• City gas-rate lawsuit, data-center policy, coin show, concerts—local niche.  

Net: Only moderate evidence that Feb 17 mark might still be slightly elevated from residual drone story and could fade.

--------------------------------------------------
(c) Timeframe analysis  
Window length = 11 days.  If window were halved (6 days) chance of “No change” would drop a little because trend volatility per day is higher.  If doubled (22 days) “No change” would rise since mean-reversion dominates.

--------------------------------------------------
(d) Justification of inside-view shift from outside view

1. Current value (19) is very slightly above usual mid-teens baseline, plausibly still inflated by 10 Feb national drone story.  
2. Pipeline of nationally-relevant El Paso news for 17–28 Feb looks thin; therefore the most likely direction over 11 days is sideways-to-down, not up.  
3. Google Trends negative moves >3 were 0 % in 90-day sample but that was only ~8 identical windows; history under-represents such reversions.  Add extra probability mass to “Decreases”.  
4. Give “Increases” a small bump above outside 5 % (to 7 %) to acknowledge weather emergencies or surprise border events could spike searches.

Probability calibration
--------------------------------------------------
Shift 11 pp from “Doesn’t change” to the tails, allocating 5 pp to “Decreases” and 1 pp to “Increases” (rounded).

Checklist
1. Options and rule paraphrased above – yes.  
2. Base rate anchored (5/93/2) – yes.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = Doesn’t change; Least likely = Increases – plausible.  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
   • Residual drone-incursion coverage likely subsiding.  
   • Feb 17 value mildly elevated at 19 vs typical mid-teens.  
   • No nationally-significant El Paso events scheduled 17-28 Feb.  
   • Historic 95 % stability in comparable windows.  
5. Blind-spot: Major migrant-border crisis, terror incident, or viral TikTok about El Paso between 22-28 Feb could push “Increases” > 3.  
6. Status quo bias checked – kept “Doesn’t change” highest.  
7. Probabilities sum to 100 and within 0-100 – confirmed.

Probabilities: [7, 81, 12]
