Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. El Paso Times (4 Feb 2026) – local entertainment listing.  Factual: specific concerts and dates.  Opinion: none germane.  Good‐quality, but only signals routine cultural traffic.  
2. El Paso Events Calendar (16 Feb 2026) – promotional page.  Mostly marketing language; no data on audience size.  Low analytical value.  
3. City of El Paso events page (accessed 16 Feb 2026) – factual notice of a Lunar New Year festival on 28 Feb; cites prior-year attendance (3 500).  Credible for scheduling; attendance figure is self-reported.  
4. PBS News (11 Feb 2026) – national outlet describing the FAA’s brief air-space shutdown.  Factual: timeline, quotes from officials.  Opinions: statements by politicians.  High reliability for the chronology.  
5. The Guardian (11 Feb 2026) – corroborates FAA story, gives flight-disruption numbers; quotes city leaders.  Reputable international source.  
6. Spectrum Local News (16 Feb 2026) – regional cable outlet detailing secondary effects of the shutdown.  Factual and consistent with 4–5.  
7. Agent report (generated 17 Feb 2026) – synthesis of open-source items plus gap analysis.  Informative but not an external primary source; treat as structured reasoning, not hard evidence.  
8. Google Trends data pull (17 Feb 2026) – objective numeric series.  Shows a huge spike to 100 on 11 Feb, current value of 19, 90-day mean 18.4, and an empirical base-rate table: in the last 90 days only 5 % of rolling 11-day windows saw a >3-point rise and 0 % saw a >3-point fall.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
• All U.S. Google-Trends windows for a mid-size U.S. city name (e.g., “Tucson”, “Albuquerque”).  
• Recent 90-day history of “el paso” itself (exact match to query).  
Because the question resolves on the identical series, the best outside reference class is the term’s own historical 11-day windows.  It directly captures its usual volatility and scaling quirks, while cross-city analogues would merely echo the same property but with extra noise (different tourism cycles, college sports etc.).  Therefore I adopt the “el paso” 90-day window statistics as my base rate.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
• Forecast window length: 11 days (17 Feb through 28 Feb inclusive).  
• Over the past 90 days, 95 % of comparable 11-day windows ended within ±3 of their start value (“Doesn’t change”), 5 % ended >3 higher, 0 % ended >3 lower.  
• The one dramatic excursion (11 Feb spike to 100) regressed back to the mid-teens within five days, underscoring that even large shocks usually fade quickly.

(d) Justification for the outside view  
The outside view purposefully ignores forthcoming-event speculation and relies on the series’ own historical behaviour.  Key take-aways:  
1. The “el paso” term is ordinarily flat; only one event (FAA shutdown) has moved it >3 points over an 11-day span in the last three months.  
2. Even after an outlier, reversion to mean is rapid, suggesting a strong gravitational pull toward the 15-25 band.  
3. Down-swings larger than three points have not occurred in the most recent 90-day sample.  While statistically possible, their empirical frequency is very low.

Outside view calibration:

• Prior probability mass is anchored at 95 % “Doesn’t change”, 5 % “Increases”, 0 % “Decreases”.  
• To avoid zero-probability traps and acknowledge model uncertainty (the 90-day sample is finite), I smooth the tails: add 2 percentage-points to “Decreases”, subtract one each from the other two buckets.  
• Historical upsets (unexpected moves >3) sit at roughly 5 % overall; assigning 8 % combined to the tail options keeps me within that empirical envelope while hedging for unseen variance.

Outside View Prediction:
['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']  
Increases: 4 %  
Doesn't change: 92 %  
Decreases: 4 %
