Analysis
----------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Source analysis  
1. KFOX (16 Feb 2026) – report on El Paso’s legal challenge to a natural-gas rate hike. Reliable local TV affiliate, purely civic-finance story, no national traction expected.  
2. National Weather Service bulletins via The Facts (16 Feb 2026) – impending 70--80 mph winds and fire-weather watch for 18-19 Feb. Authoritative government data.  
3. KFOX (16 Feb 2026 AM) – City-council agenda on data-centre policy framework. Local governance; low broader interest.  
4. Breitbart (16 Feb 2026) – analysis of the 10 Feb drone incursion that briefly shut El Paso airspace. National conservative site, factual basis confirmed by NOTAM; some opinion spin.  
5. Additional calendar/event listings (Visit El Paso, Eventbrite) – promotional, no hard news value.

(b) Evidence analysis  
• Drone-incursion aftermath – Moderate evidence for lingering national curiosity; search spike on 11 Feb already registered (value 100). Any new incident would have to exceed this to lift 28 Feb value >22.  
• Severe-wind / fire watch – Weak-to-moderate. If winds ignite a large wildfire or cause major damage, national outlets would mention “El Paso,” potentially lifting searches. Most such watches end uneventfully.  
• Local policy, gas-rate fight, layoffs – Weak evidence; unlikely to shift national search behaviour.  
• Seasonality / decay pattern – Strong historical evidence: after a one-day 100 spike, daily interest typically decays toward baseline (~14) within two weeks.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window = 11 days (17 Feb → 28 Feb).  
If the horizon were halved to ~5 days, probability of “Doesn’t change” would rise a few points (less time for a new trigger).  If doubled to ~22 days, tail probabilities (both up and down) would grow ~5 pp each as more events could intervene.

(d) Justification of inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base: 10 / 80 / 10 (Increase / No-change / Decrease).

Shifts applied:  
+2 pp to Decrease – residual decay from the 11 Feb mega-spike makes a slide below 16 (19-3) somewhat likelier than the long-run 6 % rate.  
+2 pp to Increase – small chance of another drone or weather headline generating fresh national coverage.  
−6 pp from No-change – reallocated to tails to reflect the two directional risks above.

Inside-view probabilities
Increases........12 %  
Doesn’t change...67 %  
Decreases........21 %

Checklist
1. Resolution: compare Google-Trends value on 28 Feb to 17 Feb (19); >+3 = “Increase,” within ±3 = “Doesn’t change,” <−3 = “Decrease.”  
2. Outside view: 10 / 80 / 10.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = Doesn’t change; least likely = Increase – aligned with reasoning.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Post-spike decay pattern after 11 Feb 100 peak (historic strong).  
   • NWS high-wind alert could spawn damaging event (moderate).  
   • Possibility of follow-on cartel-drone incident (moderate).  
   • Current level (19) only modestly above long-run baseline (weak upward drag).  
5. Blind-spot: A high-impact national story (mass shooting, major migrant surge) centring on El Paso before 28 Feb could push interest well above 22, making “Increase” far likelier.  
6. Status-quo pull: ordinary civic news rarely moves national search interest; hence “Doesn’t change” still dominant.  
7. Technicalities: probabilities sum to 100 and lie between 0–100.

Probabilities: [12, 67, 21]
