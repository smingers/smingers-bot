You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “el paso” change between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-28 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “el paso” at the time of writing this question (Feb 16, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 19; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=el%20paso&date=2026-01-17%202026-02-16).

`{"format":"trends_interest_change_magnitude","info":{"topic":"el paso","trend_start":"2026-02-17","trend_end":"2026-02-28","verification_url":"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=el%20paso&date=2026-01-29%202026-02-28"}}`

The options are: ['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves “Doesn't change” if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=el%20paso&date=2026-01-29%202026-02-28](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=el%20paso&date=2026-01-29%202026-02-28) for 2026-02-28 is within 3 of the value at 2026-02-17. It resolves “Increases” if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves “Decreases” if the value is more than 3 lower.

# Summary of Article: FAA lifts airspace shutdown over El Paso after announcing 10-day closure hours earlier

**Source:** PBS News  
**Date:** February 11, 2026

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Incident Details:**
   - The FAA initially announced a 10-day closure of airspace around El Paso International Airport in Texas
   - The closure was lifted Wednesday morning (February 11, 2026) after only hours
   - Reason given: Mexican cartel drone incursion

2. **Drone Activity at Border:**
   - More than 27,000 drones were detected within 500 meters (1,600 feet) of the southern border in the last six months of 2024
   - Most drones fly late at night
   - Cartels use drones nearly every day to bring drugs across the U.S.-Mexico border and surveil Border Patrol agents
   - Homeland Security has seized thousands of pounds of methamphetamine, fentanyl and other drugs in recent years from cartel drone operations

3. **Geographic Context:**
   - El Paso has a population of nearly 700,000 people (larger including metro area)
   - Neighboring Ciudad Juárez, Mexico has about 1.5 million people
   - El Paso is a hub of cross-border commerce

4. **Airport Operations:**
   - The initial closure was to ground all flights (commercial, cargo, and general aviation) through late February 20
   - Operations resumed Wednesday morning
   - Airlines operating there include Southwest, United, American, and Delta

## Statements from Named Officials:

- **Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy:** Said the FAA and Defense Department "acted swiftly to address a cartel drone incursion. The threat has been neutralized and there is no danger to commercial travel in the region." Did not specify how many drones were involved or what was done to disable them.

- **Rep. Veronica Escobar (Democrat, El Paso district):** Said neither her office, the city of El Paso, nor airport operations received advance notice. Stated "The information coming from the federal government does not add up" and later said she believed the shutdown was not based on Mexican cartel drones in U.S. airspace, saying "is not what we in Congress have been told."

- **Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum:** Said she had "no information about the use of drones on the border" and that her government would look into "the exact causes" of the closure.

- **U.S. Sen. Ben Ray Lujan (Democrat, New Mexico):** Demanded answers about why the airspace was closed without notifying appropriate officials.

- **Steven Willoughby (Deputy Director, DHS counter-drone program):** Testified in July that cartels use drones nearly every day at the border.

</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Identify upcoming major events or news likely to raise or lower national attention to “El Paso” between 17 Feb 2026 and 28 Feb 2026, including scheduled sports games, concerts, festivals, political visits, immigration actions, court decisions, extreme weather, or high-profile anniversaries involving El Paso.
National search interest in “El Paso” over the coming forecast window (17 Feb – 28 Feb 2026) will depend on whether any events break out of the local news cycle and attract attention statewide or nationally.  The items found in the record can be grouped as follows.

1. Immigration / Border-security developments  
   • Fort Bliss “Camp East Montana” – already the largest U.S. immigration detention site – remains under intense scrutiny after three detainee deaths were ruled homicides or are still under investigation (KTEP, 23 Jan 2026).  Advocates, Rep. Veronica Escobar and 122 members of Congress are demanding its closure.  
   • DHS is reportedly planning a second, even larger facility near El Paso (KTEP, 23 Jan 2026). if the agency formally announces the project or if further deaths occur, the story could dominate cable and national press coverage.  
   • El Paso has already been in national headlines this month because the FAA abruptly closed the city’s airspace on 10 Feb, then reversed the order hours later, sowing confusion and prompting angry statements from city officials and Rep. Escobar (Guardian, 11 Feb 2026).  Congressional or FAA follow-up hearings or leaked explanations could easily surface between 17 Feb and month-end; any such disclosure would again put “El Paso” in national feeds.  
   • New Mexico’s just-signed “Immigration Safety Act” banning new ICE detention contracts (El Paso Times, 5 Feb 2026) highlights El Paso by comparison because it underscores that the region on the Texas side is expanding detention.  Activists already coordinate across state lines; rallies in El Paso are plausible as the May effective date approaches.

   Probability of a national-level headline during the window: moderate.  Immigration is a standing national beat, and reporters are already camped in El Paso; even a small trigger (another death, an inspector-general report leak, or a hearing notice) would spike searches.

2. Crime / Court cases  
   • The Walmart mass-shooting case concluded with a guilty plea in April 2025 (Spectrum News, 21 Apr 2025); no hearings are scheduled in late Feb 2026.  
   • Death-row appeals involving El Paso serial killer David Wood are pending but no February docket date is posted (El Paso Matters, 14 Jan 2026).  Unless the Court of Criminal Appeals calendars a sudden hearing, court-related attention looks quiet.

   Probability of national spike: low for this window.

3. Extreme weather or disasters  
   • No forecasts of notable winter storms or drought emergencies affecting the Trans-Pecos border have been issued in the sources reviewed.  February is typically dry; unless an unexpected cold-air outbreak occurs, weather-driven spikes are unlikely.

4. Scheduled entertainment & sports  
   The city has a dense lineup of mid-scale entertainment events inside the window:

   a. Performing arts & concerts  
      • Broadway revival “The Wiz,” Plaza Theatre, 18 – 22 Feb (El Paso Live).  
      • Wild Kratts Live! family show, 21 Feb (El Paso Live).  
      • El Paso Symphony Orchestra – “The Seventh Symphonies” program, 27 – 28 Feb (El Paso Live).  
      • City Lunar New Year Festival, Cleveland Square Park & Downtown Arts District, 28 Feb, historically draws ~3,500 in a day (City of El Paso events calendar).  

   b. Sports  
      • Tuff Hedeman Bull-Riding Extravaganza, County Coliseum, 21 Feb (El Paso Times, 4 Feb 2026).  The event’s namesake is a four-time world champion; past editions have aired on Cowboy Channel but rarely crack mainstream sports coverage.  
      • UTEP men’s basketball: Conference-USA home game vs NM State already took place 7 Feb; the next listed game is 21 Feb (opponent not yet posted in truncated schedule) and additional games are possible 25/26 Feb on the road, but C-USA games seldom trend nationally unless an upset against a ranked opponent occurs (UTEP Miners schedule).

   These happenings will generate robust local media but historically do not move national Google Trends numbers for “El Paso.”  In the past year, concert or college-basketball dates produced daily U.S. trend values under 25 (normalized scale) whereas immigration surges or the Walmart plea pushed values into the 60-100 range.

5. Major anniversaries  
   • No round-number anniversaries of high-profile events fall in the window; the next major one (7th anniversary of the 2019 Walmart massacre) is not until August.

Summary of likely impact on Google Trends (national scale):

• Immigration/detention & FAA fallout: most plausible catalyst for a jump.  Any breaking news, congressional hearing notice, or further detainee fatality could lift national “El Paso” search interest well above the baseline of 15-25 into the 40-70 band, sufficient to register as an “Increase” in the forecasting market definition (greater than 3-point move).  
• Entertainment & sports slate: expected to keep local interest healthy but historically insufficient to move the national needle by more than 1-2 points.  
• Courts, weather, anniversaries: no known triggers.

Information gaps:

• No precise February court docket for David Wood or any other El Paso-linked federal case was located; a late-scheduled hearing could surprise.  
• DHS timelines for the rumored second detention facility and any scheduled congressional oversight hearings have not been published.  
• The FAA or House Transportation Committee agenda for an inquiry into the 10 Feb airspace closure is not yet released; confirmation would strengthen the probability estimate.

Overall assessment: Absent any sudden border-security or FAA revelations, national attention to “El Paso” is likely to drift modestly lower after the 10-11 Feb spike, because the scheduled cultural and sports events are local-regional in reach.  However, the immigration/detention storyline is “live” and could reignite quickly; one high-visibility development would be enough to push February 28 interest measurably above February 17.  The outlook therefore leans toward interest either holding steady or increasing, driven largely by unpredictable federal or humanitarian news rather than by the entertainment calendar.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.
