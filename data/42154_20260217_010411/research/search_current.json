The City Council, led by Mayor Renard Johnson, authorized the City Attorney and City Manager to pursue all available legal avenues to protect residents from what the city describes as an unjustified and inequitable rate hike. The proposed increase would raise average household bills by approximately 10%\u2014about $3 to $4 per month\u2014while larger homes could see a 19% rise, or roughly $11 more monthly. The Texas Gas Service claims the hike is necessary to cover service costs and maintain reliable infrastructure. Notably, the El Paso City Council had previously rejected the same rate increase proposal in November 2025. The city argues that the decision must be reevaluated to ensure fairness and accountability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 10:22 PM\nSource:[KFOX](https://kfoxtv.com/news/local/city-of-el-paso-challenges-texas-gas-rate-hike-proposes-rehearing-railroad-commission)\n\n**TX WFO EL PASO Warnings, Watches, and Advisories**\nThe National Weather Service (WFO El Paso) issued warnings, watches, and advisories for Wednesday, February 18, 2026, covering the region including West Texas and parts of southern New Mexico. A high-level cold front will bring increasing dryness and strong winds on Wednesday, with gusts reaching up to 80 mph. Strong winds are expected to approach 70 mph along and east of El Paso. The combination of strong winds and low relative humidity (as low as 15%) will create a high fire danger, especially in the afternoon. Outdoor burning is not recommended. The fire weather watch indicates that critical fire weather conditions are forecast to occur, with the potential for rapid fire spread if ignitions occur. The watch includes areas such as El Paso County, the Franklin Mountains, the southern and central parts of the Chihuahuan Desert, and the Rio Grande Valley. A fire watch is also in effect for the northern and southern portions of the region. The fire weather watch is valid from 12 PM to 7 PM Wednesday, with wind gusts up to 80 mph and relative humidity as low as 15%. The National Weather Service warns that any fires that start are likely to spread rapidly. The fire weather watch is issued to alert the public to prepare for dangerous fire conditions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 07:31 PM\nSource:[The Facts](https://thefacts.com/ap_news/weather/tx-wfo-el-paso-warnings-watches-and-advisories/article_264bc109-7a13-5b15-94c3-751db17c5c13.html)\n\n**El Paso City Council set to discuss data center policy framework**\nThe El Paso City Council is set to begin discussions on a proposed policy framework for data center development, scheduled for Tuesday, February 16, 2026. The agenda authorizes the city manager to develop the framework and return to council within 60 days with a formal proposal. The framework aims to establish clear, consistent guidelines for reviewing and approving data centers while assessing long-term impacts on infrastructure, utilities, and the community. Key components include infrastructure and utilities assessments\u2014collaborating with electric, water, and gas providers, El Paso County, and regional partners to evaluate system capacity and demand; land use and zoning rules to define appropriate locations, ensure compatibility with surrounding areas, and preserve space for future community-serving projects; and a focus on local economic benefit, including a 'Hire El Paso First' provision in development agreements to prioritize local hiring and create workforce training pathways in partnership with schools and workforce organizations. The move follows Meta's announced $1.5 billion artificial intelligence data center project in northeast El Paso, expected to create 2,000 jobs. If approved, the city manager will have 60 days to deliver a comprehensive proposal outlining findings, stakeholder input, and implementation strategies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 05:25 AM\nSource:[KFOX](https://kfoxtv.com/news/local/el-paso-city-council-set-to-discuss-data-center-policy-framework)\n\n**NM WFO EL PASO Warnings, Watches, and Advisories**\nOn Tuesday, February 17, 2026, the National Weather Service (WFO) El Paso issued a High Wind Watch for the region, effective from Tuesday morning through Tuesday evening, with strong winds expected to reach 25 to 35 mph, gusting up to 45 mph. A second High Wind Watch was issued for Wednesday, with winds ranging from 25 to 35 mph and gusts up to 45 mph. The watches cover areas including the eastern slopes of mountains below 4,000 feet and mountainous regions above 4,000 feet. The National Weather Service warned that strong winds could cause damage to trees and power lines, and that driving conditions would be difficult, especially for high-profile vehicles, on roads in the north and south. The advisory also emphasized the importance of monitoring the latest forecasts and warnings.

This marks the first mass layoff reported in 2026 by the state agency, following a 2025 in which multiple companies announced workforce reductions totaling hundreds of employees. The announcement comes amid mixed economic conditions in the local area: while some firms have reduced staff, others have recently announced expansion projects expected to create hundreds of new jobs, creating a contrasting labor market landscape in the border region. HGS previously operated a physical call center at 8465 Gran Vista Drive in eastern El Paso, which is now vacant. The building\u2019s empty windows reflecting the sunset have become a visible symbol of the company\u2019s shift from in-person to remote operations and now to further workforce reductions. Although the direct impact of 92 layoffs is smaller than the adjustments seen in 2025, labor analysts view such notices as early indicators of broader trends in third-party service sectors, particularly in customer service operations transitioning between in-person, remote, and automated models.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 12:53 AM\nSource:[El Diario de Ju\u00e1rez](https://diario.mx/el-paso/2026/feb/15/despediran-a-92-empleados-remotos-de-call-center-en-el-paso-1105744.html)\n\n**ANALYSIS: El Paso Airspace Shutdown Indicates Growing Pains in Trump Admin's Attention to Long-Ignored Cartel Drone Menace**\nThe February 10, 2026, airspace shutdown over El Paso, triggered by a cartel drone incursion, highlights the Trump administration\u2019s growing focus on a long-ignored threat: drug cartel use of unmanned aircraft systems (UAS) along the U.S.-Mexico border. The incident prompted a Notice to Airmen (NOTAM) that led to a near-total ground stop at El Paso International Airport, later terminated after less than eight hours. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy confirmed on X that the threat had been neutralized. The episode follows President Trump\u2019s June 2025 executive order, 'Restoring American Airspace Sovereignty,' which identified cartels using drones to smuggle fentanyl, surveil law enforcement, deliver contraband to prisons, and conduct attacks. The order mandated increased counter-UAS capabilities and led to the deployment of military units\u2014including the 10th Mountain Division\u2019s AN/TPQ-53 and AN/MPQ-64 Sentinel radar systems\u2014to the southwest border, marking a significant shift in homeland defense. Despite progress, challenges remain in distinguishing hostile drones from civilian air traffic. In April 2026, Principal Deputy Assistant Secretary Mark Roosevelt Ditlevson testified before Congress, noting that Middle Eastern counter-UAS systems are unsuitable for U.S. civilian airspace due to intelligence demands and risk of collateral damage. To address this, the Department of War launched the Drone Dominance Program (DDP), inviting 25 vendors to compete in phase one for low-cost attack drones and innovative counter-UAS technologies. The El Paso incident, while marred by poor communication, signals the administration\u2019s renewed momentum in confronting a threat previously downplayed under the Biden administration, with cartels estimated to conduct 40,000 to 60,000 drone incursions annually.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 12:06 AM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/border/2026/02/15/analysis-el-paso-airspace-shutdown-indicates-growing-pains-in-trump-admins-attention-to-long-ignored-cartel-drone-menace/)\n\n**TX El Paso Tx/Santa Teresa NM Zone Forecast**\nThe TX El Paso Tx/Santa Teresa NM Zone Forecast for Sunday, February 15, 2026, indicates variable weather conditions across multiple regions.

The National Weather Service noted that this pleasant weather would be short-lived. Starting Tuesday, a more active spring-like pattern was expected, bringing breezy to windy conditions to Southern New Mexico and Far West Texas. Strong winds could trigger blowing dust and reduced visibility, particularly in open and desert areas. A High Wind Watch was issued for parts of the Sacramento Mountains, where gusts could exceed 50 miles per hour. Rain chances remained low, with only slight precipitation possible near the Gila region.

The initial claim, which appeared credible, suggested the closure was due to the arrival of Cuban President Miguel D\u00edaz-Canel, with speculation that he would be brought to El Paso\u2014historically linked to Joaqu\u00edn 'El Chapo' Guzm\u00e1n\u2014followed by theories involving Mexican political figures like Ad\u00e1n Augusto L\u00f3pez or even the 'Santo Patrono of the 4T'. Other versions included fears of a military invasion, bridge closures, and a potential attack on Fort Bliss, with some joking about organizing a welcome rather than resistance. Despite the growing paranoia, no organized response emerged. The author reflects on the collective passivity, contrasting past patriotic rituals with present-day inaction. The situation escalated with claims of drones and a balloon mistaken for a drone, while official communications contradicted one another. Eventually, the airport reopened, and the incident was revealed to be a hoax\u2014possibly a prank or a mistaken balloon sighting. The author concludes that the episode was a collective psychological exercise fueled by uncertainty, a 'bad joke' or 'good anecdote' that quickly faded, emphasizing the need to move on and continue daily life.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 06:00 AM\nSource:[diario.mx](https://diario.mx/opinion/2026/feb/14/historia-de-una-histeria-1105658.html)\n\n**Real Estate Market Trends in El Paso, TX: Inventory Climbs - December 2025**\nIn December 2025, El Paso, TX, exhibited strong real estate market momentum with a 15.7% year-over-year increase in active listings, reaching 2,355 properties\u2014exceeding the national inventory growth rate of 12.1%.

The data, sourced from the U.S. Bankruptcy Court for the Western District of Texas, includes Chapter 7 (liquidation), Chapter 11 (business reorganization), and Chapter 13 (individual repayment plans). While El Paso\u2019s increase is modest compared to other major Texas cities, the upward trend reflects growing financial pressures in a border community long affected by lower wages and rising living costs. San Antonio led in absolute numbers with 2,904 filings, a 18.2% increase (447 more cases), while Austin saw the highest percentage increase at 23.7% (360 additional cases). Midland recorded a 9.8% rise. The trend spans economically diverse cities, suggesting broader economic forces at play. Contributing factors include persistently high interest rates, rising inflation affecting housing and groceries, and economic downturns in Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez, Mexico, where 7,585 jobs were lost from January to October 2025\u2014especially in manufacturing, which lost 9,551 jobs. This cross-border impact affects El Paso due to strong familial and economic ties. Chapter 7 filings are most common among individuals, while Chapter 13 allows for structured repayment plans. Chapter 11 is used by businesses for reorganization. Additional indicators show El Paso\u2019s residential construction permits dropped 2.9% from January to August 2025, the smallest decline among analyzed metropolitan areas, with average permit values decreasing by $1,000 (0.5%) to $236,000\u2014still the lowest in the region, below Las Cruces ($272,000) and Dallas-Fort Worth ($303,000). The rise in bankruptcies is seen as an early warning sign that families and businesses have exhausted other financial options. The Hunt Institute will continue monitoring employment and economic trends in border metropolitan areas through the first half of 2025.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 27, 2025 06:00 AM\nSource:[diario.mx](https://diario.mx/el-paso/2025/dec/26/aumentan-declaraciones-de-quiebra-en-el-paso-1099334.html)\n\n**One Texas city makes list of top travel destinations for 2026**\nEl Paso, Texas, has emerged as a top travel destination for 2026, according to the HomeToGo 2026 Travel Trends Forecast, which identifies five key travel trends shaping global travel.
