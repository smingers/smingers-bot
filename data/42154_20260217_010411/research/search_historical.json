Veronica Escobar (Democrat, El Paso district):** Said neither her office, the city of El Paso, nor airport operations received advance notice.

The items found in the record can be grouped as follows.\n\n1. Immigration / Border-security developments  \n   \u2022 Fort Bliss \u201cCamp East Montana\u201d \u2013 already the largest U.S. immigration detention site \u2013 remains under intense scrutiny after three detainee deaths were ruled homicides or are still under investigation (KTEP, 23 Jan 2026).  Advocates, Rep. Veronica Escobar and 122 members of Congress are demanding its closure.  \n   \u2022 DHS is reportedly planning a second, even larger facility near El Paso (KTEP, 23 Jan 2026). if the agency formally announces the project or if further deaths occur, the story could dominate cable and national press coverage.  \n   \u2022 El Paso has already been in national headlines this month because the FAA abruptly closed the city\u2019s airspace on 10 Feb, then reversed the order hours later, sowing confusion and prompting angry statements from city officials and Rep. Escobar (Guardian, 11 Feb 2026).  Congressional or FAA follow-up hearings or leaked explanations could easily surface between 17 Feb and month-end; any such disclosure would again put \u201cEl Paso\u201d in national feeds.  \n   \u2022 New Mexico\u2019s just-signed \u201cImmigration Safety Act\u201d banning new ICE detention contracts (El Paso Times, 5 Feb 2026) highlights El Paso by comparison because it underscores that the region on the Texas side is expanding detention.  Activists already coordinate across state lines; rallies in El Paso are plausible as the May effective date approaches.\n\n   Probability of a national-level headline during the window: moderate.  Immigration is a standing national beat, and reporters are already camped in El Paso; even a small trigger (another death, an inspector-general report leak, or a hearing notice) would spike searches.\n\n2. Crime / Court cases  \n   \u2022 The Walmart mass-shooting case concluded with a guilty plea in April 2025 (Spectrum News, 21 Apr 2025); no hearings are scheduled in late Feb 2026.  \n   \u2022 Death-row appeals involving El Paso serial killer David Wood are pending but no February docket date is posted (El Paso Matters, 14 Jan 2026).  Unless the Court of Criminal Appeals calendars a sudden hearing, court-related attention looks quiet.\n\n   Probability of national spike: low for this window.\n\n3. Extreme weather or disasters  \n   \u2022 No forecasts of notable winter storms or drought emergencies affecting the Trans-Pecos border have been issued in the sources reviewed.  February is typically dry; unless an unexpected cold-air outbreak occurs, weather-driven spikes are unlikely.\n\n4. Scheduled entertainment & sports  \n   The city has a dense lineup of mid-scale entertainment events inside the window:\n\n   a. Performing arts & concerts  \n      \u2022 Broadway revival \u201cThe Wiz,\u201d Plaza Theatre, 18 \u2013 22 Feb (El Paso Live).  \n      \u2022 Wild Kratts Live! family show, 21 Feb (El Paso Live).  \n      \u2022 El Paso Symphony Orchestra \u2013 \u201cThe Seventh Symphonies\u201d program, 27 \u2013 28 Feb (El Paso Live).  \n      \u2022 City Lunar New Year Festival, Cleveland Square Park & Downtown Arts District, 28 Feb, historically draws ~3,500 in a day (City of El Paso events calendar).  \n\n   b. Sports  \n      \u2022 Tuff Hedeman Bull-Riding Extravaganza, County Coliseum, 21 Feb (El Paso Times, 4 Feb 2026).  The event\u2019s namesake is a four-time world champion; past editions have aired on Cowboy Channel but rarely crack mainstream sports coverage.  \n      \u2022 UTEP men\u2019s basketball: Conference-USA home game vs NM State already took place 7 Feb; the next listed game is 21 Feb (opponent not yet posted in truncated schedule) and additional games are possible 25/26 Feb on the road, but C-USA games seldom trend nationally unless an upset against a ranked opponent occurs (UTEP Miners schedule).\n\n   These happenings will generate robust local media but historically do not move national Google Trends numbers for \u201cEl Paso.\u201d  In the past year, concert or college-basketball dates produced daily U.S. trend values under 25 (normalized scale) whereas immigration surges or the Walmart plea pushed values into the 60-100 range.\n\n5. Major anniversaries  \n   \u2022 No round-number anniversaries of high-profile events fall in the window; the next major one (7th anniversary of the 2019 Walmart massacre) is not until August.\n\nSummary of likely impact on Google Trends (national scale):\n\n\u2022 Immigration/detention & FAA fallout: most plausible catalyst for a jump.  Any breaking news, congressional hearing notice, or further detainee fatality could lift national \u201cEl Paso\u201d search interest well above the baseline of 15-25 into the 40-70 band, sufficient to register as an \u201cIncrease\u201d in the forecasting market definition (greater than 3-point move).  \n\u2022 Entertainment & sports slate: expected to keep local interest healthy but historically insufficient to move the national needle by more than 1-2 points.  \n\u2022 Courts, weather, anniversaries: no known triggers.\n\nInformation gaps:\n\n\u2022 No precise February court docket for David Wood or any other El Paso-linked federal case was located; a late-scheduled hearing could surprise.  \n\u2022 DHS timelines for the rumored second detention facility and any scheduled congressional oversight hearings have not been published.  \n\u2022 The FAA or House Transportation Committee agenda for an inquiry into the 10 Feb airspace closure is not yet released; confirmation would strengthen the probability estimate.\n\nOverall assessment: Absent any sudden border-security or FAA revelations, national attention to \u201cEl Paso\u201d is likely to drift modestly lower after the 10-11 Feb spike, because the scheduled cultural and sports events are local-regional in reach.  However, the immigration/detention storyline is \u201clive\u201d and could reignite quickly; one high-visibility development would be enough to push February 28 interest measurably above February 17.  The outlook therefore leans toward interest either holding steady or increasing, driven largely by unpredictable federal or humanitarian news rather than by the entertainment calendar.</Agent_report>\n\n<GoogleTrendsData term=\"el paso\">\nGoogle Trends US data for \"el paso\" (last 90 days):\n\nCurrent value: 19\n90-day mean: 18.4\n90-day std dev: 9.0\n\nBASE RATE ANALYSIS (using 11-day windows to match question timeframe):\n- In 95% of 11-day windows, the value changed by \u22643 points (\"Doesn't change\")\n- In 5% of 11-day windows, the value INCREASED by >3 points\n- In 0% of 11-day windows, the value DECREASED by >3 points\n\nRecent trend: increasing (last 7 days avg: 33.9 vs prior 7 days: 17.4)\n\nDAILY VALUES (last 30 days):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-19,16\n2026-01-20,16\n2026-01-21,19\n2026-01-22,19\n2026-01-23,21\n2026-01-24,21\n2026-01-25,20\n2026-01-26,18\n2026-01-27,19\n2026-01-28,17\n2026-01-29,17\n2026-01-30,17\n2026-01-31,18\n2026-02-01,17\n2026-02-02,16\n2026-02-03,18\n2026-02-04,18\n2026-02-05,19\n2026-02-06,18\n2026-02-07,18\n2026-02-08,16\n2026-02-09,16\n2026-02-10,17\n2026-02-11,100\n2026-02-12,36\n2026-02-13,23\n2026-02-14,21\n2026-02-15,18\n2026-02-16,20\n2026-02-17,19\n\nNote: Google Trends values are relative (0-100 scale), not absolute search volumes.\n</GoogleTrendsData>\n"
