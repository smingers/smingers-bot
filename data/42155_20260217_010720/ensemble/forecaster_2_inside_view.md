**Key Factual Evidence:**
- MCO closed $426.44 on Feb 13, 2026 (last known close before question opening)
- Stock down 16.52% YTD and 20.87% over past month
- Recent 11.1% drop triggered by S&P Global's weak guidance (sector contagion)
- Goldman Sachs cut price target to $532 (still implies upside but reduced conviction)
- 52-week high was $539.61 (Jan 15, 2026), suggesting recent momentum reversed

**Evidence Analysis:**

*Strong Evidence:*
- **Sector headwinds from S&P Global**: The Feb 11 guidance cut from a direct peer caused immediate 11.1% MCO decline, followed by another 5% drop. This represents concrete negative momentum entering the forecast window. The sector-wide concern about credit rating/data provider conditions is a structural headwind.

*Moderate Evidence:*
- **Recent downtrend**: 20.87% decline over past month and 16.52% YTD indicates strong negative momentum. However, this could also represent oversold conditions that might reverse.
- **Goldman Sachs target cut**: While maintaining positive rating, the reduced target ($532) signals diminished near-term optimism from a major sell-side firm.

*Weak Evidence:*
- **Valuation arguments**: Simply Wall St's $575 fair value is opinion-based and doesn't predict short-term price action.
- **Old analyst ratings**: October-December ratings are stale for an 8-day forecast.

**Timeframe Analysis:**

The forecast window is 8 trading days (Feb 17-28, 2026). This is extremely short-term where:
- Fundamental analysis has limited predictive power
- Technical momentum and sentiment dominate
- Random market noise is significant

If timeframe were **halved to 4 days**: Recent negative momentum would weigh more heavily; less time for reversal. Probability might drop to 48-50%.

If timeframe were **doubled to 16 days**: More opportunity for mean reversion from oversold conditions; earnings catalyst (Feb 18) would have more time to be digested. Probability might rise to 58-60%.

**Justification for Adjusting Base Rate:**

Starting from 56% outside view base rate (MCO's historical 8-day positive return frequency):

*Factors arguing for LOWER probability:*
1. **Sector contagion** (strong evidence): S&P Global's weak guidance triggered immediate 16% decline in MCO. This represents a concrete negative catalyst that broke the stock's uptrend. The sector-wide concern is not company-specific and may persist.

2. **Negative technical momentum** (moderate evidence): 20.87% decline over past month represents the worst monthly performance in recent history. Short-term momentum indicators are deeply negative.

3. **Timing of earnings** (moderate evidence): Feb 18 earnings (day 2 of forecast window) introduces binary risk. While historical beat rate is high, the sector headwinds and recent Goldman target cut suggest lowered expectations could still disappoint.

*Factors arguing for HIGHER probability:*
1. **Oversold conditions** (moderate evidence): 16.52% YTD decline may have created technical oversold conditions that could bounce.

2. **Historical earnings performance** (weak evidence): MCO typically beats estimates, but this is already in the base rate.

**Net Assessment:**
The sector contagion from S&P Global represents a structural shift in sentiment that wasn't present in the historical base rate calculation. The 11.1% immediate drop followed by continued weakness suggests the market is repricing credit rating agencies downward. This is a significant enough development to warrant adjusting the base rate downward.

However, the adjustment should be moderate (not extreme) because:
- 8 days allows some recovery time
- Oversold conditions could trigger technical bounce
- The stock is still well above 52-week lows ($378.71)

**Probability Calibration:**

Starting base rate: 56%

Adjustments:
- Sector headwinds/negative momentum: -6 percentage points
- Earnings binary risk in window: -2 percentage points  
- Oversold bounce potential: +2 percentage points

**Inside view prediction: 50%**

This represents a modest downward adjustment from the base rate, acknowledging that recent sector-specific negative catalysts have shifted near-term odds slightly against a positive return, while recognizing that over 8 days the outcome remains highly uncertain and close to a coin flip.

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will MCO close on Feb 28, 2026 exceed its Feb 17, 2026 close? 8 trading days. ✓ Aligned.

2. **Base rate**: 56% from MCO's 10-year historical 8-day positive return frequency. Final prediction (50%) is modestly below this, justified by recent sector-specific headwinds not present in historical average. ✓

3. **Consistency**: "50 out of 100 times, MCO closes higher after 8 trading days." This reflects genuine uncertainty with slight bearish tilt from recent momentum. ✓ Aligned.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - S&P Global guidance cut caused 11.1% MCO drop (factual, Feb 11)
   - MCO down 20.87% over past month (factual, Feb 16)  
   - Goldman Sachs cut price target to $532 (factual, identifiable source)
   - Stock at $426.44, down 16.52% YTD (factual, Feb 13)
   - Earnings on Feb 18 introduces binary risk (factual, scheduled)
   All evidence is factually valid. ✓

5. **Blind spot**: Earnings beat on Feb 18 triggers relief rally, reversing recent pessimism. If MCO beats estimates by wide margin and provides strong guidance, stock could rally 5-10% quickly, making my 50% forecast look too bearish. This scenario has ~30% probability and would shift my forecast to 60%.

6. **Status quo**: Recent trend is strongly negative (-20.87% over month). If this momentum continues, stock goes lower. However, 8 days is long enough for mean reversion. Given high volatility and binary earnings catalyst, 50% appropriately reflects uncertainty rather than extrapolating recent decline.

Probability: 50%
