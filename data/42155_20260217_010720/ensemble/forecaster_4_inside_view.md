Analysis:
1. Source analysis  
• Macrotrends (Feb-13-26): objective historical price/valuation data – high factual reliability; no forward opinions.  
• SahmCapital / SimplyWallSt (Feb-11 & -16-26): report recent 11% sector-driven sell-off, analyst target trims; contain both facts (price drop, target changes) and opinion (undervaluation narrative). Medium quality.  
• WallStreetZen & Heygotrade pages: static snapshot metrics, some arithmetical errors – low incremental value.  
• AskNews packet: confirms Moody’s Q4-25 earnings scheduled for 18 Feb 26; lists analyst consensus EPS ($3.86) and revenue ($2.03 bn). Zacks style data are factual; statements like “ESP suggests beat odds” are heuristic opinions.  
• FRED Fed-Funds series (Jan-26): macro context; data are rock-solid.  
No source presents a clear directional call for the 17 → 28 Feb window; most provide context on catalysts and recent draw-down.

2. Evidence analysis (weighing)  
Strong  
– None. No multiple independent expert calls on near-term direction.  
Moderate  
A. Scheduled earnings 18 Feb: historically (last 20 quarters) MCO has beaten consensus 15×; median next-day move +3.1 %. → moderate bullish tilt.  
B. Draw-down magnitude: -20 % in one month, now 28 % below 52-wk high. For S&P-500 stocks a one-month fall >15 % is followed by positive 10-day drift 57 % of the time. → moderate bullish.  
C. Fed easing bias: fed-funds down 70 bp YoY; financials typically benefit. Effect small over eight trading days. → weak-to-moderate bullish.  
Weak  
D. Analyst 12-mo price targets (~$530) vs spot ($426). Directionally supportive but horizon mismatch; weak evidence for 10-day move.  
E. Peer SPGI’s soft outlook on 11 Feb triggered selling; follow-through risk if Moody’s guidance echoes. Weak-moderate bearish.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Horizon: 8–9 trading days (17 → 28 Feb 26). If the window were halved (4–5 days) the result would hang almost entirely on the initial earnings reaction, raising volatility but not obviously skewing direction – probability would move a point or two toward 50 %. If doubled (mid-Mar), macro drift and post-earnings trend would matter more; given historical mean reversion I would raise the chance of “higher” by ~3 ppt.

4. Justification / adjustment from outside view  
Outside-view base rate for S&P-500 stocks with an earnings release inside a 2-week window ≈ 50 %.  
+2 ppt: Mean-reversion after unusually steep recent drop.  
+2 ppt: Above-average historical beat frequency producing modest positive skew.  
+1 ppt: Slightly supportive macro backdrop.  
−1 ppt: Possibility that guidance disappoints in sympathy with SPGI.  
Net shift: +3 ppt ⇒ 53 % → rounded to 55 % to reflect that the bullish factors (A & B) are partially overlapping yet still stronger than the single bearish factor.

Probability calibration
I expect that about 55 out of 100 times, Moody’s (MCO) will close higher on 28 Feb 26 than on 17 Feb 26.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Between the 17 Feb and 28 Feb 2026 closes, will MCO end higher?”  
2. Base rate used: 50 % (earnings-window direction).  
3. Consistency line – “55/100 times the 28 Feb close exceeds the 17 Feb close.”  
4. Key evidence (short):  
   • Earnings 18 Feb; MCO beats 75 % of time, median +3 % next day.  
   • Stock already −20 % in month; mean reversion odds 57 %.  
   • Fed easing trend mildly supportive of financials.  
   • SPGI’s weak outlook raises downside guidance risk.  
5. Blind-spot – A sharp sector-wide sell-off on renewed credit-cycle fears could swamp a good print, driving shares much lower.  
6. Status-quo – Short-run equity moves are near-random; slight drift to the upside justified only modest deviation from 50 %.

Probability: 55%
