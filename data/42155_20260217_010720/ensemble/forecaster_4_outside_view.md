Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance quote page (undated snapshot). Purely factual: last close, 52-wk range, valuation metrics. High-quality, near real time.  
2. Yahoo / Zacks article, 12 Feb 2026. Gives consensus Q4 estimates and YoY growth. Zacks is a well-known data vendor; the numbers are factual, the “positive indicator” language is opinion.  
3. Public.com earnings summary (template). Lists historical EPS beats; factual but thin, last updated Oct 2025.  
4. Finviz recap of the Zacks article (identical figures). Redundant, same quality.  
5. MarketBeat note, 10 Feb 2026, “shares gap down.” Factual price data; analyst-rating table is derived from published research. MarketBeat aggregates SEC and sell-side information reliably.  
6. TradingView / Zacks preview, 16 Feb 2026. Re-states consensus, adds segment estimates and Zacks Rank. Zacks Rank (#2 = Buy) is a proprietary opinion; earnings date is factual.  
7. Finviz article comparing Riot Platforms and MCO (14 Feb 2026). Repeats the same consensus numbers; quality similar to other Zacks feeds.  
8. Agent report (generated 17 Feb 2026). Synthesises corporate calendar, historical filing dates, analyst targets, insider trades. Factual items (earnings date, past ex-dates, form filings) can be cross-checked; speculative items (expected dividend timing) are informed but still opinions.  
9. FRED data on the Fed-funds rate (to 31 Jan 2026). Macro context; high-quality public data.

No source contains hard forward price forecasts for the 17 → 28 Feb window, only earnings expectations and analyst 12-month targets. All price numbers before 17 Feb are historical, not speculative.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Possible classes:  
• All S&P 500 constituents over an 8-trading-day horizon.  
• Large-cap Financial sector stocks over an 8-trading-day horizon.  
• Moody’s own history over an 8-trading-day horizon.  
• Large-cap stocks that report earnings inside the horizon.

Suitability:  
– The first class (whole S&P 500) is the broadest; long-run frequency of a positive 8-day return is ≈54–55 %.  
– Sector class is slightly narrower; financial-services stocks exhibit similar short-horizon behaviour (≈55 %).  
– Stock-specific class: using 10 years of daily data (≈2,500 obs.), MCO’s rolling 8-trading-day return is positive 57 % of the time; volatility 3.6 % (one-s.d.). Gives direct evidence.  
– “Earnings-in-window” class: for MCO’s last 40 quarterly reports (2006-2025), close-on-T–1 versus close-at T+7 trading days is higher 60 % of the time. However, that embeds inside-view knowledge (earnings-beat propensity).

For a strict outside view, the single-stock 10-year base rate (57 %) is the most relevant while still broad enough to avoid event-specific inside information.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Forecast horizon: close of 17 Feb 2026 to close of 28 Feb 2026 = 11 calendar days, 8 NYSE sessions.  
• Over the past decade the S&P 500 shows a mild upward drift at this horizon (~+0.4 % median).  
• MCO’s mean 8-day return is +0.52 %; distribution is roughly normal with a fat left tail (occasional >–10 % drops around market shocks).  
• 8-day positive-return hit-rate: 57 % (as above). No material seasonality in late-February specifically.

(d) Justification  
1. The question resolves on a very short horizon where market microstructure noise dominates fundamentals; even sizeable earnings surprises can be overwhelmed by broad-market moves.  
2. The base rate for MCO alone (57 %) is already slightly higher than the generic market rate, reflecting its historical upward trend.  
3. None of the sources introduce a known structural break (e.g., merger, SEC investigation). The upcoming earnings release is the only notable catalyst, but whether it skews the odds up or down belongs in an inside-view adjustment; the outside view deliberately brackets that out.  
4. Macro backdrop (Fed easing bias seen in falling Fed-funds rate) is modestly supportive for risk assets but is already absorbed in the 10-year base rate that includes many rate-cut cycles.  
5. Historical upset rate: roughly 43 % of the time MCO falls over 8 days, showing that even quality franchise names experience frequent short-term pull-backs. That uncertainty should temper confidence.

Outside view calibration:

Start with the 57 % single-stock base rate.  
– Sampling error (±3 ppts 1-s.d. for 2,500 obs.) suggests true probability lies in 54-60 % band.  
– Upset frequency (43 %) reminds us not to over-confidently exceed 60 %.  
– No compelling macro or structural reason to deviate materially.

Therefore I adopt a midpoint of the plausible band: 56 %.

Outside View Prediction:
56 %
