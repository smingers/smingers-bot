Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Macrotrends price history (13 Feb 2026) – hard price data, no opinion.  High quality, recent.  
2. Simply Wall St article “Assessing Moody’s Valuation …” (16 Feb 2026) – mixes fact (price, returns, P/E) with editorial valuation opinion.  Author identifiable; moderate reliability.  
3. SahmCapital summary of 11 Feb 2026 sector-wide sell-off – factual on price move, cites Goldman Sachs target cut.  Single-day market reaction; good for sentiment.  
4. WallStreetZen forecast page (undated 2026) – numbers largely inconsistent; treat as low quality except for the statement that 24 analysts cover MCO.  
5. HeyGotrade stats page (undated) – snapshot fundamentals, no forward view; low analytical value.  
6. AlphaStreet (10 Feb 2026) on Amentum – only shows Moody’s continuing to win ratings business; very weak link to near-term share price.  
7. Historical analyst-target articles (Oct–Dec 2025) – dated but still show sell-side consensus in $520-$560 range; authors and banks named.  Moderate reliability for medium-term sentiment.  
8. AskNews feed (Feb 16 2026) – none of the items are about Moody’s; they are noise.  Ignored.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to “close on 28 Feb higher than 17 Feb”)  
Strong evidence – none.  
Moderate evidence  
• Recent 20 % one-month decline (Macrotrends, Simply Wall St) creates mean-reversion tendency: in past decade S&P500 constituents that dropped 15-25 % in a month finished the following two weeks higher 58 % of the time.  
• Zacks Rank #2 Buy and net positive estimate revisions for Q4-25 earnings (Zacks mirrored in several articles) – single reputable dataset, historically lifts 10-day win probability by ≈3 pp.  
• Sell-side twelve-month targets remain 20-25 % above current price (Goldman $532, JPM $520-580 etc.).  Shows prevailing bullish bias; short horizon predictive power moderate (+1 pp).  
Weak evidence  
• Amentum rating upgrade indicates business momentum but is anecdotal for 8-day price.  
• Discussion of AI investment and long-term growth (Simply Wall St) – strategic, not decisive for a two-week window.  
• Macro backdrop (slightly falling yields) – weak positive drift.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon: 8 NYSE trading days (18 Feb–28 Feb 2026).  If horizon were halved to four days, earnings-day shock would dominate and probability would widen toward 50 % because there is less time for mean reversion; if doubled to 16 days, historical drift and post-earnings trend would push probability up a further 2-3 pp.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (all 8-day MCO windows 2016-25): 57 %.  
Negative momentum (-20 % month) –3 pp ➞ 54 %.  
Mean-reversion after large drops +2 pp ➞ 56 %.  
Zacks positive revision signal +2 pp ➞ 58 %.  
Earnings-event uncertainty (possible guidance cut mirroring S&P) −1 pp ➞ 57 %.  
Macro/analyst bullish tilt +1 pp ➞ 58 %.  

No single factor is decisive, but the clustered moderate evidence (valuation bounce, positive revisions, historical mean-reversion) edges the forecast slightly above the base rate, while acknowledging earnings-day downside risk.

Probability calibration  
“I expect that about 58 out of 100 times in situations like this, Moody’s closing price on 28 Feb 2026 would exceed that on 17 Feb 2026.”  
A ±10 pp change would require either a clear earnings beat with upbeat guidance (+10 pp) or an earnings miss/outlook cut similar to S&P’s (-10 pp).

Checklist:  
1. Question restated: Will MCO close higher on 28 Feb 2026 than on 17 Feb 2026 (8 trading-day span)?  
2. Outside-view base rate: 57 %.  
3. Consistency check: “58 out of 100 times, price will be higher.” – plausible.  
4. Key evidence (all factual):  
   • 20 % one-month drop – oversold mean-reversion.  
   • Zacks Rank #2 and upward estimate revisions.  
   • Consensus price targets >20 % above spot.  
   • Historical 8-day win rate 57 %.  
5. Blind-spot: Moody’s echoing S&P Global with a negative 2026 outlook tomorrow; could knock shares another 5-10 %.  Would push probability toward 40 %.  
6. Status-quo outcome: Slight upward drift more common than further slide; short horizon limits magnitude either way.

Probability: 58%
