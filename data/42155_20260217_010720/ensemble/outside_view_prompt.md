<Agent_report>
Query: Provide recent analyst notes, upcoming corporate events, and key news between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-28 that could affect Moody's Corporation (MCO) share price; include any SEC filings, guidance changes, or ex-dividend dates
Between 17 February 2026 (the day after this report is written) and 28 February 2026 the single-most important catalyst for Moody’s Corporation (NYSE: MCO) shares is the company’s fourth-quarter- and full-year-2025 earnings release scheduled for 18 February 2026 (Yahoo Finance “Earnings Date” field, 13 Feb 2026).  Historically, Moody’s issues its quarterly dividend declaration, annual revenue/earnings guidance and full Form 10-K in the same news cycle or within 7-10 days of the earnings call, so the entire period 18-28 February will be event-heavy.  Below is a consolidated view of every known item that could move the share price in that window, together with the most recent analyst commentary, insider/SEC activity and dividend timetable.

1. Upcoming corporate events (17-28 Feb 2026)

• Q4-25 Earnings release & conference call – 18 Feb 2026 (Yahoo Finance).  Consensus EPS is $3.46, +32 % YoY (Yahoo Finance headline, 13 Feb 2026).  Management customarily gives full-year guidance and an outlook for global bond-issuance volumes on that call, both of which the market treats as material.  
• Board dividend declaration – very likely 18 Feb 2026.  Moody’s has announced its first-quarter dividend together with Q4 results in each of the past five years.  The last quarterly dividend was $0.94 per share with an ex-dividend date of 21 Nov 2025 (Yahoo Finance “Ex-Dividend Date” field).  
• Ex-dividend date for the next payment – expected in late February.  If the board keeps its typical timetable (ex-date roughly nine trading days after declaration), the next ex-dividend date would fall around 27-28 Feb 2026—inside the forecast window.  Confirmation will come with the 18 Feb press release.  
• Form 10-K filing – Historically filed 24-27 Feb.  In 2025 Moody’s filed its 10-K on 26 Feb.  A similar timing would place the 2025 10-K within the period and could reveal new risk-factor language or share-repurchase authorisations.  
• No investor-conference presentations or Moody’s-hosted capital-markets days are listed on the public events calendar for 17-28 Feb.  The next external event on Moody’s Events site is in March (Moody’s Events page, accessed 14 Feb 2026).

2. Recent analyst notes & rating/price-target changes (Jan-Feb 2026)

Although no new notes have appeared after 16 Feb, investors will still trade on the most recent batch of reports:

• Wells Fargo (14 Jan 2026) – reiterates “Overweight”, lifts target to $660 from $620 (+55 % upside to 16 Feb close). (MarketBeat alert, 14 Feb 2026 – citing research note dated 14 Jan).  
• Evercore ISI (8 Jan 2026) – raises target to $620, “Outperform”. (MarketBeat 14 Feb 2026).  
• Stifel Nicolaus (5 Jan 2026) – $574 target, “Buy”. (MarketBeat 14 Feb 2026).  
• Goldman Sachs (9 Feb 2026) – cuts target to $532, maintains “Buy”. (MarketBeat 16 Feb 2026).  
• BMO Capital (23 Oct 2025 but still referenced) – $507, “Market Perform”. (MarketBeat 16 Feb 2026).  
Consensus: 18 analysts – 1 Strong Buy, 12 Buy, 5 Hold; average price target $558.56 (MarketBeat summaries, 14-16 Feb 2026).  Any significant beat or miss on 18 Feb is likely to trigger fresh revisions during the window.

3. Key news items published 14-16 Feb 2026

• Institutional flows:  
   – CIBC World Markets almost doubled its stake to 14,845 shares (+98 %) according to its latest 13F (MarketBeat, 14 Feb 2026).  
   – Shell Asset Management cut its holding by 81 % (MarketBeat, 15 Feb 2026).  
   – HighTower Advisors trimmed its position by 5.8 % (MarketBeat, 16 Feb 2026).  
   These divergent flows show active repositioning ahead of earnings and may amplify volatility around 18 Feb.

• Price action context:  MCO is down 16.8 % year-to-date and 20 % in the past month, closing at $426.44 on 13 Feb (yFinance data).  Options implied volatility for the 20 Feb weekly expiry is 88-89 %, triple the 3-month IV, underscoring the market’s focus on the earnings event (yFinance options table).

4. SEC filings & insider activity in the run-up to the window

• Form 144 – 2 Feb 2026: CEO Robert Fauber notified the planned sale of 592 shares (~$0.3 m) under a Rule 10b5-1 plan.  Prior small sales were disclosed for Nov 2025-Jan 2026 (Stocktitan, 2 Feb 2026).  
• Form 8-K – 12 Jan 2026: director appointment (Stockinsights.ai, 12 Jan 2026).  
No 8-K regarding guidance changes has been filed YTD, so new guidance will almost certainly debut on 18 Feb.  The CEO’s small programmed sales are unlikely to be price-moving by themselves but could be interpreted cautiously given the recent share-price draw-down.

5. Fundamental and macro considerations during the period

• Bond-market conditions.  Moody’s Investors Service revenue is tightly correlated with global bond issuance.  IG and HY issuance rebounded in January after a soft Q4 because Treasury yields retreated 60 bp.  A hawkish shift by the Federal Reserve at its 25-26 Feb semi-annual testimony (if any) could temper issuance expectations and weigh on MCO.  
• Regulatory climate.  No pending rulemaking is scheduled in late February, but investors monitor U.S. and EU initiatives on credit-ratings process oversight; any commentary in the 10-K risk factors could affect sentiment.  
• Sector read-across.  Peer S&P Global (SPGI) reports on 21 Feb 2026.  A material surprise there often spills over into MCO given their near-identical business mix.

6. Dividend and share-buyback framework

• Last dividend: $0.94, ex-21 Nov 2025, paid 13 Dec 2025 (Yahoo Finance).  
• Expected next dividend: declaration on 18 Feb, payable late March, ex-date likely 27-28 Feb.  A raise would be viewed positively because payout increases have accompanied every February announcement since 2017 (average annual raise 10 %).  
• Repurchases: Moody’s exhausted the previous $2-bn authorisation in Q3 2025; renewal details customarily appear in the earnings release.  A new buyback programme would be a bullish signal.

7. Material information gaps that will close during 17-28 Feb

• Actual Q4 numbers, FY-26 guidance and any change to cost-savings or margin targets.  
• Confirmation of the Q1-26 dividend amount and ex-dividend date.  
• Filing of the 2025 Form 10-K, including share-repurchase statistics through 31 Dec 2025 and updated risk factors.

Investors should monitor: (i) the earnings press release and call on 18 Feb, (ii) the associated dividend/buyback announcements, and (iii) the 10-K when filed—each of which falls squarely inside the resolution window for the forecasting question of whether MCO will close higher on 28 Feb than on 17 Feb.  Because implied volatility is elevated and the share price has already fallen sharply YTD, the market is positioning for a potentially large upside or downside move driven by these events.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
