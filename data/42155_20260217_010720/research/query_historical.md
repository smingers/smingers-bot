Analysis:
To gauge whether MCO will trade higher on 2026-02-28 than on 2026-02-17, I need background on:
• Moody’s most-recent earnings (likely Q4-2025) and any forward guidance that could move the share price in the next 11 days.  
• Near-term scheduled events (ex-dividend date, investor day, regulatory hearings) or macro catalysts (rate-cut expectations) that historically influence rating-agency stocks.  
• Recent analyst upgrades/downgrades and news sentiment specific to MCO since these can drive short-horizon moves.  
• Broader market/financial-sector conditions—e.g., interest-rate path—because Moody’s revenue is tied to debt-issuance volumes.
