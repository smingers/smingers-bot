As of December 5, 2025, Moody's stock closed at $489.48, with a year-to-date return of 3.52% and a three-year total shareholder return of 73.16%, indicating sustained long-term momentum. The company's investment in AI and machine learning\u2014evidenced by 40% of Moody's Analytics products now featuring GenAI enablement and GenAI spending growing at twice the rate of overall MA\u2014positions it to capture more of the data-driven risk management market, driving higher recurring revenues and improved net margins. A 'Most Popular Narrative' values Moody's at $545.50, marking it as 10.3% undervalued, based on steady growth assumptions, margin expansion, and a higher future earnings multiple. However, this upside is contingent on manageable private credit regulation and no erosion of pricing power or client stickiness by alternative AI competitors. In contrast, a valuation breakdown reveals Moody's trades at 38.9 times earnings\u2014well above the peer average of 30.7 times and industry average of 23.9 times\u2014and more than double its fair ratio of 17.7 times, suggesting potential downside if market sentiment shifts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 05, 2025 12:17 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

(MCO) Stock Price Prediction: 2025, 2026, 2030: Analyst Targets & Forecast * Benzinga**\nMoody's Corp. (MCO) stock is the subject of mixed analyst sentiment, with a consensus 'Outperform' rating from 20 analysts. The average price target is $534 per share, representing moderate upside from current levels, with a high target of $620 and a low of $390. The three most recent ratings suggest a near-term average target of $527, indicating a 9% upside. The company has a market cap of $85.69 billion, a trailing P/E of 41.00, and a forward P/E of 30.67, reflecting a high valuation. MCO has shown strong revenue growth and rising profit margins, supported by its dominant position in the credit rating industry\u2014where it, S&P Global, and Fitch Ratings collectively control 95% of the market. However, risks include high valuation, dependence on debt issuance volume, and potential disruption from artificial intelligence in its risk analysis tools. Analysts project moderate price movements for 2025, a steep decline in 2026 due to macroeconomic headwinds and AI competition, and a moderate downside by 2030, driven by rising interest rates and AI-driven market share erosion. The article notes that lower interest rates could boost demand for credit ratings, but long-term growth may be constrained by technological disruption and elevated valuation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 04, 2025 01:38 PM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/money/moodys-corp-mco-stock-price-prediction)\n\n**Raymond James Upgrades MCO Rating to Market Perform | MCO Stock**\nRaymond James upgraded Moody's Corporation (MCO) stock rating from Underperform to Market Perform on October 17, 2025, reflecting a more optimistic outlook by analyst Patrick O'Shaughnessy.

Despite the modest weekly gain, the stock remains below analyst price targets, prompting investor debate over whether this presents a meaningful entry point or if long-term growth expectations are already priced in. Over the past year, Moody's has delivered a 6% total return, with stronger compound gains over the last three and five years, reflecting steady long-term performance. The company's valuation narrative suggests it is undervalued, with a calculated fair value of $545.50\u201411.1% above the current closing price. This undervaluation is supported by accelerating demand in private credit markets, evidenced by 75% year-over-year revenue growth in that segment, 25% of first-time mandates from private credit, and sustained demand for independent risk assessment. Moody's strategic investments in AI and machine learning\u2014such as 40% of Moody's Analytics products now featuring GenAI enablement and GenAI-related spending growing at twice the rate of the overall division\u2014position the company to capture a larger share of the data-driven risk management market, potentially driving recurring revenue and margin improvements. However, challenges remain, including persistent regulatory scrutiny and increasing competition from AI-driven platforms, which could threaten growth and market positioning.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 04, 2025 02:23 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!
