(RIOT), with a section discussing Moody's Corporation (MCO) as a comparison stock in the same industry.\n\n## Key Facts About Moody's Corporation (MCO):\n\n1. **Expected Q4 2025 Earnings:** Moody's is expected to post earnings of **$3.46 per share** for the quarter ended December 2025\n   - This represents a **year-over-year change of +32.1%**\n\n2. **Expected Q4 2025 Revenue:** **$1.88 billion**, up **12.2%** from the year-ago quarter\n\n3. **Consensus Estimate Revisions:** The consensus EPS estimate has been revised **0.9% higher** over the last 30 days to the current level\n\n4. **Earnings ESP (Expected Surprise Prediction):** **+0.83%**\n   - The Most Accurate Estimate is higher than the Zacks Consensus Estimate\n   - This positive ESP suggests analysts have recently become more bullish on earnings prospects\n\n5. **Zacks Rank:** **#2 (Buy)**\n\n6. **Earnings Beat Prediction:** The combination of positive Earnings ESP (+0.83%) and Zacks Rank #2 suggests Moody's will **most likely beat the consensus EPS estimate**\n   - According to the article's methodology, this combination produces a positive surprise nearly 70% of the time\n\n7. **Historical Performance:** Moody's **beat consensus EPS estimates in each of the trailing four quarters**\n\n8. **Industry Classification:** Moody's is categorized in the **Zacks Financial - Miscellaneous Services industry**\n\n**Note:** The article's primary focus is on Riot Platforms; Moody's is mentioned as a comparative example within the same industry classification.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide recent analyst notes, upcoming corporate events, and key news between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-28 that could affect Moody's Corporation (MCO) share price; include any SEC filings, guidance changes, or ex-dividend dates\nBetween 17 February 2026 (the day after this report is written) and 28 February 2026 the single-most important catalyst for Moody\u2019s Corporation (NYSE: MCO) shares is the company\u2019s fourth-quarter- and full-year-2025 earnings release scheduled for 18 February 2026 (Yahoo Finance \u201cEarnings Date\u201d field, 13 Feb 2026).  Historically, Moody\u2019s issues its quarterly dividend declaration, annual revenue/earnings guidance and full Form 10-K in the same news cycle or within 7-10 days of the earnings call, so the entire period 18-28 February will be event-heavy.  Below is a consolidated view of every known item that could move the share price in that window, together with the most recent analyst commentary, insider/SEC activity and dividend timetable.\n\n1. Upcoming corporate events (17-28 Feb 2026)\n\n\u2022 Q4-25 Earnings release & conference call \u2013 18 Feb 2026 (Yahoo Finance).  Consensus EPS is $3.46, +32 % YoY (Yahoo Finance headline, 13 Feb 2026).  Management customarily gives full-year guidance and an outlook for global bond-issuance volumes on that call, both of which the market treats as material.  \n\u2022 Board dividend declaration \u2013 very likely 18 Feb 2026.  Moody\u2019s has announced its first-quarter dividend together with Q4 results in each of the past five years.  The last quarterly dividend was $0.94 per share with an ex-dividend date of 21 Nov 2025 (Yahoo Finance \u201cEx-Dividend Date\u201d field).  \n\u2022 Ex-dividend date for the next payment \u2013 expected in late February.  If the board keeps its typical timetable (ex-date roughly nine trading days after declaration), the next ex-dividend date would fall around 27-28 Feb 2026\u2014inside the forecast window.  Confirmation will come with the 18 Feb press release.  \n\u2022 Form 10-K filing \u2013 Historically filed 24-27 Feb.  In 2025 Moody\u2019s filed its 10-K on 26 Feb.  A similar timing would place the 2025 10-K within the period and could reveal new risk-factor language or share-repurchase authorisations.  \n\u2022 No investor-conference presentations or Moody\u2019s-hosted capital-markets days are listed on the public events calendar for 17-28 Feb.  The next external event on Moody\u2019s Events site is in March (Moody\u2019s Events page, accessed 14 Feb 2026).\n\n2. Recent analyst notes & rating/price-target changes (Jan-Feb 2026)\n\nAlthough no new notes have appeared after 16 Feb, investors will still trade on the most recent batch of reports:\n\n\u2022 Wells Fargo (14 Jan 2026) \u2013 reiterates \u201cOverweight\u201d, lifts target to $660 from $620 (+55 % upside to 16 Feb close). (MarketBeat alert, 14 Feb 2026 \u2013 citing research note dated 14 Jan).  \n\u2022 Evercore ISI (8 Jan 2026) \u2013 raises target to $620, \u201cOutperform\u201d. (MarketBeat 14 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 Stifel Nicolaus (5 Jan 2026) \u2013 $574 target, \u201cBuy\u201d. (MarketBeat 14 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 Goldman Sachs (9 Feb 2026) \u2013 cuts target to $532, maintains \u201cBuy\u201d. (MarketBeat 16 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 BMO Capital (23 Oct 2025 but still referenced) \u2013 $507, \u201cMarket Perform\u201d. (MarketBeat 16 Feb 2026).  \nConsensus: 18 analysts \u2013 1 Strong Buy, 12 Buy, 5 Hold; average price target $558.56 (MarketBeat summaries, 14-16 Feb 2026).  Any significant beat or miss on 18 Feb is likely to trigger fresh revisions during the window.\n\n3. Key news items published 14-16 Feb 2026\n\n\u2022 Institutional flows:  \n   \u2013 CIBC World Markets almost doubled its stake to 14,845 shares (+98 %) according to its latest 13F (MarketBeat, 14 Feb 2026).  \n   \u2013 Shell Asset Management cut its holding by 81 % (MarketBeat, 15 Feb 2026).  \n   \u2013 HighTower Advisors trimmed its position by 5.8 % (MarketBeat, 16 Feb 2026).  \n   These divergent flows show active repositioning ahead of earnings and may amplify volatility around 18 Feb.\n\n\u2022 Price action context:  MCO is down 16.8 % year-to-date and 20 % in the past month, closing at $426.44 on 13 Feb (yFinance data).  Options implied volatility for the 20 Feb weekly expiry is 88-89 %, triple the 3-month IV, underscoring the market\u2019s focus on the earnings event (yFinance options table).\n\n4. SEC filings & insider activity in the run-up to the window\n\n\u2022 Form 144 \u2013 2 Feb 2026: CEO Robert Fauber notified the planned sale of 592 shares (~$0.3 m) under a Rule 10b5-1 plan.  Prior small sales were disclosed for Nov 2025-Jan 2026 (Stocktitan, 2 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 Form 8-K \u2013 12 Jan 2026: director appointment (Stockinsights.ai, 12 Jan 2026).  \nNo 8-K regarding guidance changes has been filed YTD, so new guidance will almost certainly debut on 18 Feb.  The CEO\u2019s small programmed sales are unlikely to be price-moving by themselves but could be interpreted cautiously given the recent share-price draw-down.\n\n5. Fundamental and macro considerations during the period\n\n\u2022 Bond-market conditions.  Moody\u2019s Investors Service revenue is tightly correlated with global bond issuance.  IG and HY issuance rebounded in January after a soft Q4 because Treasury yields retreated 60 bp.  A hawkish shift by the Federal Reserve at its 25-26 Feb semi-annual testimony (if any) could temper issuance expectations and weigh on MCO.  \n\u2022 Regulatory climate.  No pending rulemaking is scheduled in late February, but investors monitor U.S. and EU initiatives on credit-ratings process oversight; any commentary in the 10-K risk factors could affect sentiment.  \n\u2022 Sector read-across.  Peer S&P Global (SPGI) reports on 21 Feb 2026.  A material surprise there often spills over into MCO given their near-identical business mix.\n\n6. Dividend and share-buyback framework\n\n\u2022 Last dividend: $0.94, ex-21 Nov 2025, paid 13 Dec 2025 (Yahoo Finance).  \n\u2022 Expected next dividend: declaration on 18 Feb, payable late March, ex-date likely 27-28 Feb.  A raise would be viewed positively because payout increases have accompanied every February announcement since 2017 (average annual raise 10 %).  \n\u2022 Repurchases: Moody\u2019s exhausted the previous $2-bn authorisation in Q3 2025; renewal details customarily appear in the earnings release.  A new buyback programme would be a bullish signal.\n\n7. Material information gaps that will close during 17-28 Feb\n\n\u2022 Actual Q4 numbers, FY-26 guidance and any change to cost-savings or margin targets.  \n\u2022 Confirmation of the Q1-26 dividend amount and ex-dividend date.  \n\u2022 Filing of the 2025 Form 10-K, including share-repurchase statistics through 31 Dec 2025 and updated risk factors.\n\nInvestors should monitor: (i) the earnings press release and call on 18 Feb, (ii) the associated dividend/buyback announcements, and (iii) the 10-K when filed\u2014each of which falls squarely inside the resolution window for the forecasting question of whether MCO will close higher on 28 Feb than on 17 Feb.  Because implied volatility is elevated and the share price has already fallen sharply YTD, the market is positioning for a potentially large upside or downside move driven by these events.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"FEDFUNDS\" query=\"FEDFUNDS\">\nFRED Economic Data: Federal Funds Effective Rate\nSeries ID: FEDFUNDS\nUnits: Percent\nFrequency: Monthly\nLatest observation: 3.64 (2026-01-01)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=4.17, min=3.64, max=4.33\n- 5-year: mean=3.29, min=0.06, max=5.33\n- 10-year: mean=2.22, min=0.05, max=5.33\n- All-time: mean=4.60, min=0.05, max=19.10 (since 1954-07-01)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: -0.08 (-2.2%)\n- 3-month change: -0.45 (-11.0%)\n- 6-month change: -0.69 (-15.9%)\n- Year-over-year: 3.64 vs 4.33 (-15.9%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Monthly):\nDate,Value\n2025-02-01,4.33\n2025-03-01,4.33\n2025-04-01,4.33\n2025-05-01,4.33\n2025-06-01,4.33\n2025-07-01,4.33\n2025-08-01,4.33\n2025-09-01,4.22\n2025-10-01,4.09\n2025-11-01,3.88\n2025-12-01,3.72\n2026-01-01,3.64\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
