Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Outside View Sources:**

The outside view analysis draws from high-quality mainstream sources (USA TODAY, CBS News, BBC, Al Jazeera, Radio-Canada) dated Feb 11-15, 2026, providing factual coverage of the Feb 10-11 shooting. These sources establish the basic facts: 8 deaths, shooter identity (Jesse Van Rootselaar, 18), mental health history, and online radicalization patterns. Expert opinions are properly attributed (Cody Zoschak from ISD, ADL findings). The Google Trends data is objective and shows clear decay pattern from peak (100 on Feb 12) to current value (3 on Feb 17).

**AskNews Articles (Feb 12-16, 2026):**

*High-quality factual sources:*
- **Nelson Star (Feb 16)**: Local vigil coverage, community response, factual reporting of memorial events
- **SooToday.com (Feb 16)**: RCMP investigation completion, school status - factual
- **CBS News (Feb 15)**: Expert analysis from Cody Zoschak (ISD) on online activity - strong sourcing
- **The Tyee (Feb 16)**: Expert analysis from Steven Rai (ISD) on mental health factors - includes identifiable expert opinion stating transgender identity "had nothing to do with this attack"

*Opinion/editorial sources:*
- **Quillette (Feb 14)**: Opinion piece arguing against using female pronouns; cites Dr. Hilary Cass but primarily editorial
- **RedState (Feb 16)**: Conservative editorial criticizing pronoun usage; includes factual quotes from father but heavily opinion-based
- **Gateway Pundit (Feb 16)**: Editorial claiming "trans mass shooter pattern" without statistical verification - weak evidence
- **Townhall (Feb 16)**: Father's statement covered but in editorial context

*Mixed factual/contextual:*
- **Sky News (Feb 16)**: Comprehensive factual coverage with official statements
- **RT (Feb 15)**: Factual details about "hunting" victims, firearms seized
- **Irish Independent (Feb 15)**: Neighbor accounts of 2023 arson attempt - anecdotal but specific
- **New York Post (Feb 12, 14)**: Mix of factual details and sensationalized framing
- **Snopes (Feb 13)**: Fact-check debunking false image - verifiable factual correction

**Key factual elements across sources:**
1. Shooting occurred Feb 10-11, 2026
2. 8 deaths confirmed (not 9 as some early reports stated)
3. Shooter died by suicide at scene
4. RCMP investigation completed by Feb 16
5. No scheduled funerals, memorials, or official events announced for Feb 17-28
6. Father's statement released Feb 16 (one-time event, no follow-up scheduled)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Google Trends decay pattern**: Multiple data points (Feb 12: 100 → Feb 17: 3) showing exponential decay typical of breaking news. This is objective, quantifiable data with clear predictive power for similar timeframes.
- **RCMP investigation completion (Feb 16)**: Multiple independent sources (SooToday, Nelson Star) confirm investigation wrapped up. This removes a potential catalyst for renewed interest.
- **No scheduled events**: Agent report and news sources confirm no funerals, memorials, or official announcements scheduled for Feb 17-28 period.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Father's statement (Feb 16)**: Covered by multiple sources but appears to be one-time statement with explicit "no further statements" declaration. Could generate brief spike but timing (day before question opens) suggests already reflected in Feb 17 value of 3.
- **School closure decision**: Premier Eby and superintendent confirmed students won't return to school, but this was announced before Feb 17, so already priced into current trend.
- **Community vigils (Feb 14-15)**: Multiple sources report vigils occurred but these are past events, not future catalysts.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Neighbor anecdotal accounts**: Irish Independent reports 2023 arson attempt - interesting context but not a future catalyst
- **Online activity revelations**: Multiple sources detail WatchPeopleDie account, Roblox game - but these are investigative findings already reported, not ongoing developments
- **Political/editorial debate**: Quillette, RedState, Gateway Pundit articles show ongoing cultural debate about transgender issues, but this is commentary on past events, not news generation

**Evidence specifically relevant to Feb 17-28 timeframe:**
- **Zero scheduled catalysts identified**: Strongest factor
- **Investigation complete**: Removes ongoing news hook
- **Decay velocity slowing**: Feb 15→16→17 shows -3, -1 pattern approaching asymptote
- **Current value (3) near baseline (2.1)**: Limited room for movement in either direction

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 11 days (Feb 17-28, 2026)

**Current position**: 6-7 days post-peak, in late decay phase approaching baseline

**If timeframe halved (5-6 days, Feb 17-22):**
Would increase confidence in "Doesn't change" to ~98%. Shorter window means less opportunity for unexpected catalysts. Value likely to remain 2-4 range with minimal volatility.

**If timeframe doubled (22 days, Feb 17-Mar 10):**
Would decrease confidence in "Doesn't change" to ~85-90%. Longer window increases probability of:
- Unscheduled memorial events
- Investigation report releases
- Anniversary-related coverage (though one month is not typical)
- Copycat incidents (low probability but non-zero over longer period)
- Policy responses generating renewed coverage

The 11-day window is short enough that status quo (continued decay to baseline) is highly likely, but long enough that a single unexpected catalyst could theoretically occur.

## (d) Justification

**Base rate**: 92% of 11-day windows show ≤3 point change, 8% show >3 increase, 0% show >3 decrease

**Current circumstances vs. reference class:**

The reference class (11-day windows across 90 days) includes the initial spike period when volatility was high. Current circumstances differ significantly:

1. **Post-spike positioning**: We're now 6+ days past peak in established decay phase. The 8% "increase" rate in base data occurred during spike window (Feb 10-13). Post-spike increases without new catalysts are extremely rare.

2. **Floor effect**: At value 3 with baseline 2.1, mathematical constraints favor "Doesn't change":
   - To "Increase": Must reach 7+ (requires 4+ point jump from 3)
   - To "Decrease": Must reach <0 (impossible)
   - To "Not change": Any value 0-6 qualifies (7-point range)

3. **Catalyst vacuum**: Agent report explicitly confirms no scheduled events. News sources show:
   - Investigation complete (no ongoing developments)
   - Father issued final statement with "no further statements"
   - School closure decided (no pending decisions)
   - Vigils already occurred (past events)

**Factors supporting shift from base rate:**

The base rate 92% "Doesn't change" should be adjusted upward because:
- We're in stable decay phase, not volatile spike phase
- Floor effect creates asymmetric probability distribution
- Zero identified catalysts for Feb 17-28 window
- Historical pattern shows news decay without catalysts is highly predictable

**Factors that could cause "Increases" (>3 point jump to 7+):**
- Unscheduled PM visit to Tumbler Ridge (possible but timing unknown, likely wouldn't significantly impact US Google searches)
- Major investigation revelation (investigation complete per RCMP)
- Copycat incident mentioning Van Rootselaar (extremely low probability)
- Cultural/political controversy going viral (editorial pieces already published, debate ongoing but not generating search spikes)

Probability estimate for "Increases": 2-4%

**Factors that could cause "Decreases" (>3 point drop to <0):**
- Mathematically impossible due to Google Trends floor at 0
- Even dropping to 0 would only be -3 points, which qualifies as "Doesn't change"

Probability estimate for "Decreases": 0-1% (only if resolution criteria somehow interpreted differently)

**Most compelling factors:**
1. **Mathematical constraint**: Starting at 3, "Doesn't change" covers 0-6 range (7 points) while "Increases" requires 7+ (4+ point jump)
2. **Zero scheduled catalysts**: No events identified for Feb 17-28 period
3. **Investigation complete**: RCMP wrapped up, removing ongoing news hook
4. **Decay pattern established**: 100→26→10→7→4→3 shows classic exponential decay approaching asymptote
5. **Near baseline**: Current 3 vs. 90-day mean 2.1 suggests limited volatility ahead

These factors justify shifting from 92% base rate to 96-97% "Doesn't change" because we're in a more stable phase than the reference class average.

## Probability Calibration

**Status quo outcome**: Continued gradual decay from 3 to 1-2 range, remaining within "Doesn't change" threshold.

**Distribution calibration:**

Starting from outside view (3% / 96% / 1%), I need to verify this aligns with evidence:

**"Increases" (>6 final value):**
- Requires 4+ point jump from current 3
- No scheduled catalysts identified
- Father's statement already occurred (Feb 16)
- Editorial debate ongoing but not driving searches
- Unscheduled events possible but low probability over 11 days
- Historical upset rate of 8% was during spike phase, not decay phase
- Adjusted probability: **2-3%**

**"Doesn't change" (0-6 final value):**
- Covers natural decay to 0-2 range
- Covers stability at 2-4 range  
- Covers small fluctuations
- Mathematical floor effect strongly favors this
- No catalysts to disrupt decay pattern
- Investigation complete removes volatility
- Adjusted probability: **96-97%**

**"Decreases" (<0 final value):**
- Mathematically impossible
- Even decay to 0 is only -3 points (qualifies as "Doesn't change")
- Only possible if resolution criteria misinterpreted
- Adjusted probability: **<1%**

**Confidence check**: 
- 97% is 97:3 odds - does this feel right? Yes, given mathematical constraints and lack of catalysts
- 2% for "Increases" is 1:50 odds - does this feel right? Yes, would require unexpected catalyst
- Could I be overconfident? Possible, but mathematical floor effect and catalyst vacuum are strong structural factors

**Final calibration**: 2% / 97% / 1%

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Question asks if Google Trends value for "jesse van rootselaar" on Feb 28 will be within ±3 points of Feb 17 value (currently 3), comparing to verification URL. "Doesn't change" = 0-6 range; "Increases" = 7+; "Decreases" = <0.

2. **Base rate**: Outside view established 3% / 96% / 1%. Final prediction 2% / 97% / 1% is rooted to this base with minor adjustment justified by post-spike stability and mathematical constraints.

3. **Consistency check**: Most likely = "Doesn't change" (97%); Least likely = "Decreases" (<1%); Yes, this aligns with mathematical floor effect, lack of catalysts, and established decay pattern.

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - Current value 3 near baseline 2.1, limiting volatility
   - Zero scheduled catalysts for Feb 17-28 window
   - RCMP investigation complete, removing news hook
   - Mathematical constraint: "Doesn't change" covers 0-6 range (7 points)
   - Established decay pattern 100→3 over 5 days without reversal

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Unscheduled major event (PM emergency visit, copycat incident, viral controversy) could spike searches to 10-20 range, making "Increases" outcome occur. This would shift to ~15% "Increases" / 85% "Doesn't change". However, probability of such event in 11-day window is genuinely low (~2-3%).

6. **Status quo**: Continued decay from 3 to 1-2 is status quo, which remains within "Doesn't change" threshold. Given low volatility and short timeframe, status quo strongly favored.

7. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs, all between 0-100.

Probabilities: [2, 97, 1]
