Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**USA TODAY (Feb 11, 2026)**: High-quality mainstream source providing comprehensive factual details about the shooting on Feb 11, 2026. Contains verified facts about casualties (8 deaths), shooter identity, police history, and ADL findings about online radicalization. Minimal opinion content except expert commentary from ADL.

**CBS News (Feb 15, 2026)**: Reputable source focusing on online activity analysis. Features expert opinion from Cody Zoschak (ISD Senior Manager) with documented timeline of Van Rootselaar's digital footprint from 2019-2025. Factual reporting with expert analysis clearly attributed.

**Radio-Canada (Feb 12, 2026)**: Canadian public broadcaster providing factual background on the shooter, family history, and police interactions. Includes court documents from 2015. Minimal opinion, primarily factual reporting.

**Newsweek (date unclear, appears Feb 11-12)**: Mainstream source covering basic facts of the incident, casualty counts, and official statements. Mix of factual reporting and political statements from Canadian officials.

**Al Jazeera (Feb 11, 2026)**: International news source with factual coverage of the incident, casualty statistics, and official statements. Includes historical context about Canadian gun laws.

**BBC (Feb 13, 2026)**: High-quality international source providing comprehensive factual overview including timeline, community details, and gun ownership statistics. Minimal opinion, primarily factual.

**Agent Report**: Synthesizes information from multiple sources to identify future catalysts. Notes only two forward-looking items: (1) PM Carney's unscheduled visit to Tumbler Ridge, (2) ongoing investigations with no scheduled updates. Concludes no significant future catalysts identified for Feb 17-28.

**Google Trends Data**: Objective quantitative data showing:
- Current value (Feb 17): 3
- Peak value (Feb 12): 100
- Recent trend: declining from peak (100→26→10→7→4→3)
- Base rate: 92% of 11-day windows show ≤3 point change
- 8% show >3 point increase
- 0% show >3 point decrease

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Mass shooting perpetrators in general**: Too broad - includes varying levels of notoriety, media coverage, and ongoing legal proceedings.

2. **School shooting perpetrators who died at the scene**: More relevant - eliminates trial-related search spikes. However, includes cases with varying levels of controversy and media attention.

3. **Recent mass shooting perpetrators in small Canadian communities**: Most specific but limited sample size. The Tumbler Ridge shooting is already noted as Canada's deadliest since 1989.

4. **Google Trends decay patterns for breaking news events (7-14 days post-peak)**: Most suitable reference class. The data shows:
   - Peak on Feb 12 (100)
   - Rapid decay: 100→26→10→7→4→3 over 5 days
   - Classic exponential decay pattern for breaking news
   - No scheduled catalysts to interrupt decay

**Selected reference class**: Google Trends decay patterns for breaking news events without scheduled follow-up catalysts, specifically examining the 11-day window matching the question timeframe.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 11 days (Feb 17 to Feb 28, 2026)

**Current position in news cycle**: 
- Shooting occurred Feb 10-11
- Peak media coverage Feb 11-13
- Question opens Feb 17 (6-7 days post-peak)
- Question resolves Feb 28 (17-18 days post-peak)

**Historical pattern from Google Trends data**:
- Feb 12: 100 (peak)
- Feb 13: 26 (-74 points)
- Feb 14: 10 (-16 points)
- Feb 15: 7 (-3 points)
- Feb 16: 4 (-3 points)
- Feb 17: 3 (-1 point)

The decay rate is slowing as it approaches baseline. The 90-day mean is 2.1, suggesting the term typically has near-zero search interest.

**Base rate from 11-day windows**: 92% show ≤3 point change, 8% show >3 increase, 0% show >3 decrease.

## (d) Justification

The Google Trends data shows a classic breaking news decay pattern. The shooting generated massive immediate interest (peak 100 on Feb 12), followed by rapid exponential decay. By Feb 17, the value has declined to 3, approaching the 90-day baseline mean of 2.1.

Critical factors supporting continued decay:
1. **No scheduled catalysts**: Agent report confirms no funerals, memorials, court hearings, or scheduled government announcements for Feb 17-28
2. **Perpetrator deceased**: No trial to generate ongoing coverage
3. **Remote location**: Tumbler Ridge (2,400 residents) limits local media amplification
4. **News cycle moved on**: 6+ days post-incident with declining media coverage
5. **Decay velocity slowing**: The rate of decline has decreased (from -74 to -16 to -3 to -1), suggesting approach to baseline

Potential upside risks (low probability):
1. **Unscheduled PM visit**: Could occur but timing unknown and likely wouldn't significantly impact US Google searches
2. **Investigation revelations**: Possible but unscheduled
3. **Copycat incident**: Would generate new searches but highly unlikely and unpredictable

The Google Trends base rate (92% of 11-day windows show ≤3 change) strongly supports "Doesn't change" as the modal outcome. However, this base rate includes the period of initial spike. Given we're now in decay phase approaching baseline (current value 3, baseline 2.1), the natural trajectory is slight continued decline.

The resolution criteria define "Doesn't change" as within ±3 points. Starting from 3, this means:
- "Doesn't change": 0-6 range
- "Increases": >6
- "Decreases": <0 (impossible since Google Trends floor is 0)

Given the value is already at 3 and baseline is 2.1, a decrease to 0-2 is natural decay, while staying at 1-6 both qualify as "Doesn't change."

Outside view calibration:

The base rate of 92% for ≤3 point change is compelling but requires calibration:

1. **Context matters**: The 92% base rate includes all 11-day windows across 90 days, including the spike period. We're now in post-spike decay, where stability is even more likely.

2. **Floor effect**: At value 3 with baseline 2.1, there's limited downward room. The term can only decrease by 3 points maximum (to 0), while it would need to increase to >6 to register as "Increases."

3. **Asymmetric risk**: 
   - To "Increase" (>3 points up): Requires reaching 7+, needing a new catalyst
   - To "Decrease" (>3 points down): Requires reaching <0, which is impossible
   - To "Not change": Any value 0-6 qualifies

4. **Historical upset rate**: The 8% increase rate in base data occurred during the initial spike window. Post-spike increases are extremely rare without new catalysts.

5. **Expert consensus**: Agent report explicitly states "no significant future catalysts have been identified."

Given these factors, I should weight heavily toward "Doesn't change" but acknowledge small possibility of either:
- Slight continued decay to 0-2 (still "Doesn't change")
- Unexpected catalyst causing spike (very low probability)

The mathematical reality is that "Doesn't change" covers a 7-point range (0-6) while starting at 3, making it the overwhelmingly likely outcome. The probability of a >3 point increase from this position without scheduled catalysts is very low (perhaps 2-5%). The probability of effective decrease is constrained by the floor.

Outside View Prediction:

Increases: 3%
Doesn't change: 96%
Decreases: 1%
