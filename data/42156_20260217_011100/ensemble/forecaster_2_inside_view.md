Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Web Articles:**
1. **Quillette (14 Feb 2026)** - Opinion/analysis piece with strong editorial stance on gender identity classification. Factual elements (casualty count, RCMP quotes, transition timeline) appear accurate and sourced to Deputy Commissioner McDonald. However, article mixes facts with editorial opinion about categorization policies. Quality: Moderate for facts, low for opinions (not from neutral experts).

2. **KATV/KOMO News (11-12 Feb 2026)** - Mainstream US news outlets reporting basic facts. Casualty figures, timeline, official statements from RCMP, PM Carney, Mayor Krakowka all directly attributed. Quality: High for factual content. Date: Within 24-48 hours of incident.

3. **Sky News (11 Feb 2026)** - UK mainstream outlet. Comprehensive factual summary with proper attribution to RCMP officials. Quality: High. Date: Day after incident.

4. **Junonews (date unclear, appears ~12-13 Feb)** - Exclusive statement from biological father disputing name usage. Single-source claim, not independently verified. Quality: Low-moderate (unverified exclusive).

5. **Multiple summaries** covering same core facts: 8 deaths, 27 injured, Feb 10-11 incident, suspect's background, mental health history. Consistent across sources.

**AskNews Articles (15-17 Feb 2026):**
- **RedState, Gateway Pundit, Townhall** (16 Feb) - Conservative outlets with strong editorial slant. Father's statement appears genuine but filtered through ideological lens. Quality: Low-moderate for opinions, moderate for father's quotes.

- **Nelson Star** (16 Feb) - Local Canadian outlet covering vigil. Factual event coverage. Quality: Moderate-high.

- **CBS News** (15 Feb) - Analysis of online activity by Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD) experts Steven Rai and Cody Zoschak. Named experts with methodology. Quality: High for expert analysis.

- **The Tyee** (16 Feb) - Canadian outlet with ISD expert analysis. Steven Rai explicitly states "absolutely no reason to believe that their transgender identity had anything to do with this attack." Quality: High for expert opinion.

- **RT** (15 Feb) - Russian state media. Facts appear consistent with other sources but editorial framing suspect. Quality: Low-moderate.

- **Irish Independent, NY Post, Times of India** (12-15 Feb) - Mix of factual reporting and sensational framing. Core facts consistent. Quality: Moderate.

- **Snopes** (13 Feb) - Fact-check debunking false image. Quality: High for debunking misinformation.

**Key Factual Consensus:**
- Incident: Feb 10-11, 2026
- 8 deaths + suspect suicide
- 27+ injured
- Suspect: Jesse Van Rootselaar, 18, transgender
- Mental health history documented by police
- Online activity on violent content sites confirmed by ISD experts

**Key Expert Opinions:**
- Steven Rai (ISD): No evidence transgender identity caused attack; mental health and violent content exposure relevant
- RCMP officials: Motive unclear, mental health history documented

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Historical decay pattern confirmed**: Current Google Trends value (4 on Feb 16, dropping to 3 by Feb 17) follows typical post-shooting name search decay. Multiple independent sources document this pattern for previous cases.
- **No scheduled catalysts**: Agent report explicitly searched for upcoming events (trial dates, memorial services, government announcements) and found none scheduled between Feb 17-28.
- **Mathematical floor constraint**: Google Trends cannot go below 0, limiting downside to maximum -3 points (from 3 to 0).

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Father's statement (Feb 16)**: Generated some news coverage but appears to be a one-day story. Not a major catalyst for sustained interest. Single-source exclusive with limited pickup.
- **Investigation completed (Feb 16)**: RCMP announced investigation concluded, school returned to district. Typically reduces rather than increases news coverage.
- **Online activity revelations (Feb 15-16)**: ISD expert analysis of WatchPeopleDie account, Roblox game. Generated articles but already 1-2 days old by forecast start date. Momentum appears to be waning.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Vigils and memorials**: Ongoing community events unlikely to drive US-based Google searches (trends data is US-focused per URL).
- **Political commentary**: Conservative outlets framing incident around transgender identity. While generating some engagement, this is typical post-shooting pattern and doesn't suggest sustained search interest growth.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction Window:** 11 days (Feb 17 → Feb 28, 2026)

**Current Position:** Day 6-7 post-incident. Historical pattern shows search interest for shooter names typically:
- Days 0-2: Peak (100)
- Days 3-5: Rapid decay (50-20)
- Days 6-10: Continued decay to noise floor (10-5)
- Days 11-14: Noise floor (0-5)

We are currently in the "continued decay" phase (value = 3-4).

**If timeframe halved (5-6 days):** Would increase "Doesn't change" probability to ~90%, as insufficient time for new catalyst to emerge and generate sustained interest.

**If timeframe doubled (22 days):** Would increase "Increases" probability to ~25-30%, as more opportunity for: manifesto release, preliminary hearing, investigative journalism pieces, or anniversary-style coverage to emerge.

**(d) Justification for Inside View Adjustment:**

**Factors supporting status quo (Doesn't change):**
1. **Decay trajectory on track**: Value already at 3-4, near noise floor. Natural continuation puts Feb 28 value at 0-3, within ±3 threshold.
2. **Investigation concluded**: RCMP announced completion Feb 16, removing ongoing news hook.
3. **No scheduled events**: Agent report confirms no trials, hearings, or official announcements planned.
4. **Historical precedent**: 92% base rate for ±3 stability in 11-day windows.

**Factors supporting increase:**
1. **Father's statement**: Generated Feb 16 coverage but appears to be one-day story. Unlikely to sustain interest through Feb 28.
2. **Online activity revelations**: ISD analysis published Feb 15-16. Already 1-2 days old; momentum appears spent.
3. **Political controversy**: Gender identity angle generating conservative media coverage, but this is typical post-shooting pattern, not a new catalyst.

**Critical assessment:** The father's statement and online activity revelations are the only "new" developments since the initial spike. However:
- Both emerged 5-6 days post-incident (typical secondary-story timing)
- Neither represents the type of major catalyst (manifesto, trial, new victim death) that historically drives sustained re-spikes
- Coverage appears concentrated in ideological outlets rather than mainstream media
- No evidence of viral social media amplification beyond initial news cycle

**Adjustment from outside view:**
- Base rate: 82% Doesn't change, 15% Increases, 3% Decreases
- Current evidence suggests slightly lower increase probability than outside view anticipated, as the "secondary revelations" (father statement, online activity) have already occurred and failed to generate sustained momentum
- However, 11-day window still allows for unexpected developments (e.g., leaked manifesto, copycat threat, PM Carney visit)

**Probability Calibration:**

Starting from outside view: [15, 82, 3]

**Adjustments:**
1. **Father statement + online revelations already priced in**: These occurred Feb 15-16, and current value (3-4) already reflects their limited impact. This suggests the 15% "Increases" probability may be slightly high. Adjust down by 3pp.

2. **Investigation completion removes news hook**: Typically reduces ongoing coverage. Slight additional adjustment down for "Increases" by 2pp.

3. **Remaining window (11 days) still allows for surprises**: Maintain some probability for unexpected catalysts (leaked documents, copycat scare, political controversy escalation). Don't over-adjust.

4. **Mathematical floor effect**: Value of 3 means "Decreases" requires either: (a) value drops to 0 AND rescaling doesn't occur, or (b) major future spike causes rescaling that shrinks Feb 17 value while Feb 28 stays low. Both scenarios remain unlikely but slightly more plausible than 3% given current low baseline. Adjust up by 2pp.

**Final calibration:**
- Increases: 15 - 3 - 2 = 10%
- Doesn't change: 82 + 3 = 85%
- Decreases: 3 + 2 = 5%

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Google Trends value for "jesse van rootselaar" on Feb 28 be within ±3 of Feb 17 value (currently 3-4)? Increases if >+3, Decreases if <-3.

2. **Base rate**: Outside view established 82% Doesn't change, 15% Increases, 3% Decreases. Final prediction (85/10/5) remains anchored to this base rate with modest adjustments.

3. **Consistency check**: Most likely = Doesn't change (85%); Least likely = Decreases (5%). Makes sense given decay trajectory, no catalysts, and mathematical floor constraint.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Value already at 3-4, near noise floor (strong)
   - Investigation concluded Feb 16, removing news hook (moderate)
   - No scheduled events through Feb 28 (strong)
   - Father statement/online revelations already occurred without sustained impact (moderate)
   - 11-day window allows for unexpected developments (weak)

5. **Blind spot**: Leaked manifesto or diary discovered between Feb 17-28 could drive major re-spike. Historical precedent shows this occurs in ~5-10% of cases. If manifesto contains shocking revelations (e.g., explicit targeting list, ideological motivation), could push value to 20-40, making my forecast look overly conservative. However, no indication such document exists or is imminent.

6. **Status quo**: Current trajectory is rapid decay to noise floor. Status quo outcome = value of 0-2 on Feb 28, which falls within "Doesn't change" threshold. Low volatility situation (post-incident decay is highly predictable). 85% confidence in status quo is appropriate.

7. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, all between 0-100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [10, 85, 5]
