**Agent Report**: Synthesizes available information about future events. Key finding: **No scheduled events, releases, or announcements for Feb 17-28, 2026**. Notes Prime Minister visit mentioned but not dated, and investigations ongoing without scheduled updates.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Mass shooting perpetrators (general)**
- Typical pattern: Intense spike in searches immediately after event (days 1-3), rapid decay over following week, minimal sustained interest beyond 2 weeks unless new developments
- Suitability: HIGH - Van Rootselaar fits this pattern exactly

**Reference Class 2: Controversial/political mass shooting cases**
- Cases involving identity politics or gun control debates can have secondary spikes when political figures comment or policies are proposed
- Suitability: MODERATE - The transgender identity aspect generated some commentary, but no major political events scheduled

**Reference Class 3: Canadian news events in US Google Trends**
- Canadian events typically generate lower US search interest than domestic events
- Interest decays faster for foreign news unless ongoing US relevance
- Suitability: HIGH - This is a Canadian event being measured in US searches

**Most suitable reference class**: Mass shooting perpetrators with Canadian event decay pattern in US searches.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 11 days (Feb 17-28, 2026)

**Historical pattern from Google Trends data**:
- Feb 11: Value 38 (shooting day)
- Feb 12: Value 100 (peak media coverage)
- Feb 13: Value 26 (rapid decay begins)
- Feb 14: Value 10
- Feb 15: Value 7
- Feb 16: Value 4
- Feb 17: Value 3 (current/baseline)

**Decay pattern**: The value dropped from 100 to 3 in just 5 days, showing extremely rapid decay. This is a 97% decline from peak.

**Base rate from 90-day data**:
- 92% of 11-day windows: change ≤3 points ("Doesn't change")
- 8% of 11-day windows: increase >3 points
- 0% of 11-day windows: decrease >3 points

However, this base rate is heavily influenced by the 80+ days of zero values before the shooting. The relevant period is the post-event decay.

## (d) Justification

The shooting occurred on Feb 10-11, 2026. By Feb 17 (today), we're already 6-7 days post-event. The Google Trends data shows:

1. **Rapid decay already occurred**: From 100 (Feb 12) to 3 (Feb 17) represents the steepest part of the decay curve
2. **No scheduled catalysts**: Agent report confirms no events, investigations releases, or announcements scheduled for Feb 17-28
3. **Natural floor effect**: At value 3, we're approaching the noise floor. Further significant decreases become mathematically difficult (can only drop to 0-2)
4. **Stabilization pattern**: The daily decline is slowing (10→7→4→3), suggesting approach to baseline

**Key factors**:
- Mass shooting searches typically stabilize at near-zero within 2 weeks absent new developments
- Canadian event in US searches = faster decay
- No memorials, trials, or policy announcements scheduled
- Value already very low (3), limiting downside potential
- Resolution criterion: change must be >3 points to count as increase/decrease

The question asks about Feb 28 value relative to Feb 17. Starting at 3, the value would need to reach 7+ to "Increase" or drop below 0 (impossible) to "Decrease" by more than 3 points.

Outside view calibration:

**Tethering to established patterns**:
- Post-mass-shooting search interest follows exponential decay
- By day 7 post-event, interest typically stabilizes at <5% of peak
- Without new catalysts, values remain stable or continue gradual decline

**Probability considerations**:
- Starting value of 3 creates asymmetry: can only decrease by 3 points maximum (to 0), but could increase by any amount
- However, natural decay suggests continued downward pressure
- The base rate of 92% "no change" is somewhat misleading because it includes pre-event zeros
- More relevant: in decay phases after news events, values typically stabilize rather than spike again

**Rate of unexpected outcomes**:
- Unforeseen developments (leaked manifesto, surprise investigation findings, copycat incident) could cause spikes
- Political controversy could reignite if major figure makes inflammatory statement
- Estimated probability of such developments in 11-day window: ~5-10%

**Calibration**:
Given the value is already at 3:
- To "Increase" (reach 7+): Would require new catalyst. Low probability given no scheduled events and natural decay pattern.
- To "Decrease" (reach <0): Impossible. Could reach 0-2, but that's only a 1-3 point change.
- To stay "Doesn't change" (0-6 range): Most likely given stabilization pattern and lack of catalysts.

The mathematical constraint is crucial: at value 3, a decrease of >3 points is impossible, while an increase of >3 points requires a new catalyst.
