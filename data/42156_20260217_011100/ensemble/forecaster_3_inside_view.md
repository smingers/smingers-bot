Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase, <30 words)  
Compare Google Trends “interest over time” values (US) for “jesse van rootselaar” on 2026-02-17 vs 2026-02-28 (URL range 2026-01-29 to 2026-02-28). If Feb28 is >3 higher → Increases; within ±3 → Doesn’t change; >3 lower → Decreases.

2) Outside view base rate distribution (given)  
Increases 12 / Doesn’t change 85 / Decreases 3.

(a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; date; facts vs opinions)

Mainstream / higher-reliability reporting
- Sky News (Feb 11-12-ish): Summarizes incident, casualties, police statements, and Canadian gun law context. Generally reliable; mostly factual reporting with attributed official quotes.  
- CBS News (Feb 15): Reports analysis of shooter’s online activity (ISD staff), Roblox content, WatchPeopleDie usage; cites named expert and platform statements. Reliable outlet; the “online footprint” analysis is partly interpretive but attributed.  
- Snopes (Feb 13): Fact-check of viral misidentified/AI-altered image. High reliability for this narrow claim; directly relevant only insofar as it can generate additional bursts of attention.  
- Canadian Press / SooToday.com (Feb 15 & Feb 16): Aggregated wire-style updates (tape removed, investigation “completed,” school status). Generally reliable for incremental developments; mostly factual.

Other reporting / mixed reliability
- Irish Independent (Feb 15): Includes neighbor claims about prior arson attempt and references to social media posts. Reputable paper, but neighbor testimony is anecdotal and can be imperfect; still can drive attention cycles.  
- The Tyee (Feb 16): Canadian outlet; discussion of online life with ISD analyst statements; adds narrative context and argues against tying motive to gender identity. Factual elements mixed with commentary framing.  
- KATV / KOMO (Feb 15-16): Local US TV affiliates syndicating national/international copy; generally fine for basic facts; not usually a primary investigative source.  
- Yahoo (Feb 12): Aggregates/rewrites; can be accurate but often mixes sensational details; reliability depends on underlying wire/source.

Partisan / opinion-heavy sources (use mainly as “attention catalysts,” not truth arbiters)
- Quillette (Feb 14): Heavily editorial about gender-identity framing; contains some factual RCMP references but largely opinion/argument. Could prolong controversy-driven searches.  
- Townhall (Feb 16) & RedState (Feb 16): Partisan commentary on father speaking and pronoun framing; facts mixed with strong editorializing. Can contribute to renewed attention among certain audiences.  
- Gateway Pundit (Feb 16): Very opinion-driven; lower reliability; could still act as a viral catalyst.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighed against the resolution mechanism)

Strong evidence
- Historical/structural pattern: search interest for perpetrators spikes immediately post-event then decays fast, especially for non-US incidents in US search data. (Strong predictive power; matches observed decay to low single digits.)  
- Current status quo: by Feb 16 the 30-day Trends value is 4 (already near “floor”), implying limited room for large point moves absent a new catalyst. (Structural floor effect.)

Moderate evidence
- Continued drip of follow-up stories (Feb 14-16) about online activity, father comments, investigation wrap-up, and misinformation debunking: increases chance of small/brief rebounds, but these typically fade within days and often shift searches to more general terms (“Tumbler Ridge shooting”) rather than the perpetrator’s name.  
- Culture-war framing (Quillette/Townhall/RedState/Gateway Pundit): can create a “second-wave” of attention, but typically smaller than initial spike and not guaranteed to land specifically on Feb 28.

Weak evidence
- Neighbor anecdotes / sensational details (Irish Independent; some tabloid-style coverage): could spark short-lived social media attention; uncertain effect size on US Google Trends for this exact query.  
- “Investigation completed / tape removed” updates: likely low-intensity news that won’t drive large search changes by itself.

Net: evidence favors “Doesn’t change,” with asymmetric tail risks mainly on the “Increase” side (a new revelation) but some “Decrease” possibility if Feb 17 is still a bit elevated and Feb 28 fades to ~0.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Forecast window: 11 days (from 2026-02-17 to 2026-02-28).  
- If halved (~5–6 days): more residual follow-up coverage likely, so slightly higher chance of “Doesn’t change” or mild “Increase” vs “Decrease.”  
- If doubled (~22 days): more time for interest to drift to (near) zero; “Decrease” becomes more plausible (though still constrained by low starting values), while “Increase” would require a larger unexpected catalyst.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustments from outside view)
Status quo if nothing changes: continued decay toward ~0–2 by Feb 28, with Feb 17 already low. Given the ±3 “Doesn’t change” band, most plausible outcome is still “Doesn’t change.”

What could produce “Increase” (>+3 from Feb 17 to Feb 28)?
- A discrete new development late in the window: manifesto/leaked writings, major investigative finding about weapon sourcing, high-profile political statements, copycat linkage, or viral misinformation wave that re-centers the name. Some ongoing controversy exists, but no clearly scheduled catalyst.

What could produce “Decrease” (<-3)?
- This requires Feb 17 to be meaningfully above Feb 28 by at least 4 points. Even if Feb 28 is ~0, Feb 17 would need to be ~4+. That’s possible if the locked-range Feb 17 value is a bit higher than the “last 30 days” view suggests, but the trend is already near the floor. So “Decrease” is possible but still a minority outcome.

Adjustment vs outside view:
- Slightly increase “Decreases” tail (from 3 → ~6) because: the event is already past peak, follow-up coverage is front-loaded (Feb 14-16), and floorward drift by Feb 28 is plausible.  
- Slightly reduce “Increases” (12 → ~11) because: follow-ups so far look incremental rather than a major new revelation; also US interest in a Canadian case fades fast.  
- Reduce “Doesn’t change” accordingly but keep it dominant.

Probability calibration
- A ±10% swing check: If I moved “Increase” up by 10 points, I’d be implicitly expecting a meaningful late-window news shock—possible but not the median path. If I moved “Doesn’t change” down by 10 points, I’d be implying much higher volatility than typical once interest is already ~0–5. So I keep “Doesn’t change” in the low–mid 80s.

Checklist:
1. Criteria alignment: compares Feb 17 vs Feb 28 values on the fixed-date URL; ±3 = “Doesn’t change”; >3 up/down = increase/decrease.  
2. Outside view used: started from [12,85,3].  
3. Consistency check: Most likely = Doesn’t change; least likely = Decreases; yes—low starting value and floor effect constrain big moves downward.  
4. Key evidence (each <20 words):
   - Post-incident Google Trends decay is steep; already near floor by Feb 16.  
   - No clearly scheduled late-window catalyst; follow-ups are incremental.  
   - Partisan controversy can cause bumps but usually small and short-lived.  
   - Canadian 사건 in US searches typically fades quickly.  
5. Blind spot: A late Feb “bombshell” (manifesto/leak/major policy speech) could spike searches and flip to “Increases.”  
6. Status quo: gradual fading with minor noise; favors “Doesn’t change.”  
7. Technicalities: probabilities sum to 100; integers; no % sign.

Probabilities: [11, 83, 6]
