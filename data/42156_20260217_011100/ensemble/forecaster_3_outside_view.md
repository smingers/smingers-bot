Analysis:
(a) Source analysis
- USA TODAY (Feb 11, 2026): Mainstream outlet summarizing RCMP details about the Tumbler Ridge mass shooting and the shooter’s identity (Jesse Van Rootselaar). High credibility for basic facts (dates, casualty counts, official quotes). Contains some interpretive framing (e.g., “troubling pattern”) but largely anchored to named officials and ADL commentary.
- CBS News (Feb 15, 2026): Mainstream outlet; focuses on online activity and expert commentary (ISD). High credibility for reported facts and attributed expert opinion; less direct for any “what happens next” timeline.
- Radio-Canada (Feb 12, 2026): Major Canadian public broadcaster; strong for factual background, licensing context, and chronology. Low speculation; high reliability.
- Newsweek (date unclear in summary; reporting via AP): Mixed reputation, but AP-sourced elements are typically reliable for basic incident facts. Less useful for forward-looking catalysts.
- Al Jazeera (Feb 11, 2026): International outlet; reliable for broad event facts and official statements (e.g., PM comments). Not specific on dates for follow-up events (e.g., “will shortly visit”).
- BBC (Feb 13, 2026): Very high reliability; good synthesis of known facts, context, and official statements. Again, minimal specificity on scheduled future milestones.
- Agent report (compiled, cites multiple outlets): Useful synthesis focused on forecasting-relevant catalysts (scheduled events). Quality depends on underlying citations; the key takeaway (“no scheduled catalysts found for Feb 17–28”) is plausible, but absence-of-evidence should be treated cautiously.
- GoogleTrendsData (last 90 days + daily last 30): Most directly relevant quantitative evidence. Shows the spike (Feb 12 = 100) and rapid decay (Feb 16 = 4; Feb 17 = 3). Also provides an empirical “11-day window” base rate for moves beyond ±3.

(b) Reference class analysis
Plausible reference classes for “interest in a specific perpetrator’s name on Google Trends over an 11–12 day horizon”:
1) “Obscure person becomes globally searched due to a single breaking-news tragedy; post-peak decay phase.” Highly suitable: the series shows a classic spike-and-decay pattern after Feb 10–12.
2) “Google Trends for low-volume proper names (often near 0) over short windows.” Suitable for understanding that most short windows show ≤3 point changes, and floor effects can limit ‘decrease’ outcomes.
3) “Mass-shooting perpetrator name searches in the US two weeks after event.” Conceptually good, but we lack a directly comparable dataset here; still supports the general expectation of continued decay absent new revelations.

Most suitable: (1) + (2) combined—because the question’s scoring depends on a small numeric threshold (±3) and the term is low-volume outside the incident.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Resolution compares 2026-02-17 vs 2026-02-28: 11 days.
- Observed pattern in the last 30 days: a sharp peak (Feb 12) followed by steep decay (100 → 26 → 10 → 7 → 4 → 3).
- Empirical “11-day window” base rate supplied: 92% “Doesn’t change” (≤3), 8% “Increase” (>3), 0% “Decrease” (>3). This is consistent with many windows being near-zero/low and therefore stable within ±3.
- Floor/threshold mechanics matter: if the Feb 17 value is very low (e.g., ~3), a “Decreases” result becomes hard or impossible (because it would require Feb 28 to be more than 3 lower). If Feb 17 is 4 or higher, “Decreases” becomes possible (e.g., ending at 0).

(d) Justification (outside view)
Outside view expectation: after a major but time-bounded news event, name-search interest usually continues to decay and then stabilizes at very low levels. With no clearly scheduled events during Feb 17–28 (per agent synthesis and the articles), the default is continued low interest.
Given the quantitative base rates (92% no-change over 11-day windows) and the observed rapid decay already underway by Feb 17, the modal outcome is that Feb 28 remains within ±3 of Feb 17.
Upside risk (“Increases”) comes from unscheduled but plausible developments (investigative disclosures, manifesto/online footprint revelations, high-profile political visit or policy announcement) that could renew searches and push the Feb 28 value >3 above Feb 17.
Downside risk (“Decreases”) is constrained by floor effects and the ±3 threshold, but remains possible if Feb 17 is ~4+ and Feb 28 prints at/near 0.

Outside view calibration:
- Anchor to provided distribution: (Increases 8%, Doesn’t change 92%, Decreases 0%).
- Adjust slightly to avoid overfitting a short/low-volume series and to account for (i) nonzero chance of a renewed news hit within the window (raising “Increases”), and (ii) floor/threshold quirks plus uncertainty about the locked-window Feb 17 value (allowing some “Decreases”).
- Net: keep “Doesn’t change” dominant but not as high as 92%; allocate modest mass to “Increases” and small mass to “Decreases”.

Outside View Prediction:
['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']
Increases: 10
Doesn't change: 85
Decreases: 5
