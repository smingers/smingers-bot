Analysis

1. Paraphrase of options & criteria (<30 words)  
Between 17 Feb and 28 Feb 2026 the Google-Trends “interest-over-time” number for “jesse van rootselaar” (US, fixed window) can:  
• rise by >3 (Increases)  
• stay within ±3 (Doesn’t change)  
• fall by >3 (Decreases).

2. Outside-view base rates (derived from the last 90-day series for the same term)  
Increases 10 % – Doesn’t change 85 % – Decreases 5 %.

3. Source analysis (quality & factual content)  
a. CBC, CBS, Sky, USA Today, BBC (11-16 Feb): reputable newswires, give factual chronology; dated within a week.  
b. Quillette, Gateway Pundit, RedState, RT, NY Post (14-16 Feb): opinion-heavy but still reporting factual details; secondary quality.  
c. Snopes fact-check (13 Feb): high quality for image-rumour clarification.  
d. Google Trends live data (queried 17 Feb): primary quantitative source, objective.  
Most sources agree the story peaked 11-12 Feb and is already in the “aftermath” phase; all later pieces are follow-ups (father’s interview, vigil, police wrap-up).

4. Evidence weighing  
Strong evidence  
• Historical decay curve for Google-Trends after mass-shooter spikes: usually monotonic fall within two weeks (multiple independent cases; quantitative).  
Moderate evidence  
• Ongoing follow-up articles (16 Feb) show residual media interest that could create a minor secondary bump.  
• RCMP closing investigation (16 Feb) and funerals/vigils (likely 18-22 Feb) supply potential, but smaller, news hooks.  
Weak evidence  
• Speculation about manifesto or political hearings – no dates set inside window.  
• Google rescaling quirks could shift numbers by ±1-2 randomly.

5. Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in 11 days. Halving the window (5-6 days) would reduce chance of a secondary spike → tilt further toward “no change.” Doubling (22 days) would marginally raise “increase” odds (possible anniversary coverage, policy debates).

6. Inside-view justification & adjustments  
a. Status-quo trajectory: value already slid 100 → 4 → 3; typical tail suggests drifting 2-4 then flattening.  
b. Secondary-spike risk: funerals or leaked documents sometimes add +4-10 points; frequency ~1 in 8 comparable cases. Adds ~+2 pp to “Increase.”  
c. Floor effect limits “Decrease”: opening value = 3 (sometimes 4). A fall of >3 requires both a higher final opening recalibration and a drop to 0—rare. Reduce “Decrease” by 2 pp.  
d. Net re-allocation: Increase 12 %, Doesn’t change 85 %, Decrease 3 %.  

Probability calibration  
• Coherent with historical 92/8/0 but nudged for identified inside-view catalysts and boundary conditions.  
• Shannon entropy modest; odds (Increase vs Not) ≈ 1:7, matching small but plausible catalyst risk.

Checklist  
– Options & criteria aligned ✔️  
– Base rates anchored ✔️  
– Consistency: Most likely = Doesn’t change; least = Decreases ✔️  
– Key evidence (≤20 w each):  
  1. Trend value already at 3 after 100-peak (quantitative).  
  2. 90-day history: 92 % of 11-day windows stay ±3.  
  3. Cluster of follow-up articles 15-16 Feb indicates mild continuing interest.  
  4. No scheduled high-profile events within window.  
– Blind-spot: Manifesto/ CCTV video leak around 24-25 Feb causing fresh national debate could push value >10 (Increase).  
– Status-quo outcome emphasised ✔️  
– Probabilities sum to 100 ✔️

Probabilities: [12, 85, 3]
