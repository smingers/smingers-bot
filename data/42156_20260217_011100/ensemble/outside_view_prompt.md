You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “jesse van rootselaar” change between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-28 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “jesse van rootselaar” at the time of writing this question (Feb 16, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 4; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=jesse%20van%20rootselaar&date=2026-01-17%202026-02-16).

</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Identify Jesse van Rootselaar, notable past spikes in online attention, and any publicly announced events, releases, appearances, competitions, legal proceedings, or publicity campaigns scheduled for 17-28 Feb 2026 that could affect U.S. Google searches. Also note if no significant future catalysts are found.
Identity and background  
• Full name: Jesse Van Rootselaar (also referred to in early reports by her mother’s surname, Jesse Strang).  
• Age and residence: 18 years old, resident of Tumbler Ridge, a remote town (≈2,400 residents) in northern British Columbia, Canada (CNN, 12 Feb 2026).  
• Personal profile: Assigned male at birth, began transitioning about six years earlier and identified publicly as female; dropped out of secondary school four years ago; documented history of serious mental-health crises and repeated police welfare checks (NPR, 11 Feb 2026; CBC, 13 Feb 2026).  
• Online activity: Ran a YouTube channel devoted to hunting and firearms, frequented forums that share violent content, and reposted videos praising the 2023 Nashville school shooter (Vancouver Sun, 13 Feb 2026; CBC, 13 Feb 2026).  
• Licensing/weapons: Held a Canadian firearms licence that expired in 2024; police had twice seized firearms from the family home before returning them following a petition (BBC, 13 Feb 2026).  
• Deceased: Died by suicide at the scene of the shooting on 10 Feb 2026 (all sources).

Notable past spikes in online attention  
Google searches for the name “jesse van rootselaar” were negligible before February 2026. The mass shooting at Tumbler Ridge on 10–11 Feb 2026 generated a large international media wave:

1. 10–11 Feb 2026 – Shooting itself: eight victims at the family home and Tumbler Ridge Secondary School; more than 25 injured; suspect found dead (NPR, 11 Feb 2026).  
2. 12 Feb 2026 – Identification of the shooter and extensive coverage by CNN, Associated Press, BBC, Global News and countless regional outlets. Social-media discourse focused on gender identity, gun control, and mental health (CNN, 12 Feb 2026; BBC, 13 Feb 2026).  
3. 12–14 Feb 2026 – Commentary pieces, e.g., Quillette essay challenging official use of female pronouns (Quillette, 14 Feb 2026), continued to amplify search traffic.  
These events explain the present Google Trends value of 4 (relative to the prior 30 days) and constitute the most significant spike on record.

Upcoming events, releases, appearances, competitions, legal proceedings or publicity campaigns (17 Feb – 28 Feb 2026)  
The news coverage surveyed contains only two forward-looking items:  
• Prime Minister Mark Carney “will shortly visit” Tumbler Ridge (Al Jazeera, 12 Feb 2026). The statement gave no date or itinerary, only that the trip would be co-ordinated “based on [community] needs.” No follow-up article assigns a calendar date, making the timing uncertain.  
• RCMP and provincial authorities have opened investigations into firearm access and police interactions; Premier David Eby promised to “use all avenues of investigation” (Vancouver Sun, 12 Feb 2026). Investigative steps, press briefings or parliamentary committee hearings have not been scheduled for the 17–28 Feb window.

No sources list funerals, memorial services, court hearings, documentary releases, book launches, or advocacy campaigns tied to Van Rootselaar that fall inside the specified period. Because the perpetrator is deceased, there will be no trial. Political debate over gun control and trans issues will persist, but nothing resembling a one-off catalyst (e.g., a parliamentary vote or Supreme Court ruling) is on the public calendar for late February.

Assessment of remaining catalysts  
Given (1) the absence of a formal schedule for the Prime Minister’s visit and (2) the lack of any other announced milestone, there is no concrete event currently slated between 17 Feb and 28 Feb 2026 that is likely to re-ignite U.S. Google searches for “jesse van rootselaar.” Barring an unforeseen development—leak of a manifesto, release of investigation findings, or sudden policy announcement—search interest should naturally decay as the news cycle moves on.

Information gaps  
• Exact date for Prime Minister Carney’s visit, if it occurs in late February, remains unknown.  
• Timetable for RCMP or provincial investigation updates has not been published.  
• Local memorial or funeral dates have not appeared in national coverage; small-town obituaries could exist but are not captured in major outlets.

Conclusion  
1. Jesse Van Rootselaar is the 18-year-old transgender suspect who killed eight people in Tumbler Ridge, B.C., on 10 Feb 2026 and then died by suicide.  
2. The mass shooting and the immediate aftermath (10-14 Feb 2026) produced the first and only significant spike in Google search interest for her name.  
3. No definitive future events, releases, appearances, competitions, legal proceedings or publicity campaigns involving Van Rootselaar are scheduled for 17 Feb – 28 Feb 2026. Unless unscheduled investigative revelations or the Prime Minister’s visit happens within that window, a further change in U.S. Google Trends interest is unlikely.  
4. Therefore, based on available information, no significant future catalysts have been identified.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
