He stated he was estranged from his son and had no role in his upbringing, saying, 'I was estranged from Jesse Strang and was not part of his life,' using the mother's surname, as the shooter did not use the Van Rootselaar name. He referred to his son using male pronouns and called him his 'son,' asserting this reflects the truth. He expressed heartbreak over the tragedy, saying, 'While that distance is the reality of our relationship, it does not lessen the heartbreak I feel for the pain that has been caused to innocent people and to the town we call home.' He emphasized compassion and respect for grieving families, stating, 'As we respect your grief, we respectfully ask that you also respect ours. There will be no further statements.' The article, published by RedState, criticizes media and Canadian law enforcement for prioritizing gender identity terminology\u2014such as avoiding 'gunman' in favor of 'gunperson'\u2014over addressing the shooter\u2019s documented history of mental illness and prior police involvement. The piece argues that focus should be on why the individual was not institutionalized or detained, rather than on pronoun usage.

Dozens attended, including former residents and educators from Tumbler Ridge. Johanna Johns, a former Grade 7/8 teacher at Tumbler Ridge Secondary, shared a deeply personal account of how the community\u2019s compassion helped her heal after her daughter\u2019s suicide in 2019. She relayed a message from current teacher Mark Deeley, who played a key role in protecting students during the shooting: 'Tell them that we are strong. Tell them that we are resilient. Tell them that when it happened, every single kid and adult at that school did their job and that saved lives. More importantly, tell them we will be back.' The speech moved the crowd, including retired educators Al and Sue-Ellen Johnson, who served in Tumbler Ridge from 1985 to 2010. Local leaders, including Kelowna Mayor Tom Dyas, MLA Kristina Loewen, and MP Stephen Fuhr, expressed solidarity, emphasizing the community\u2019s resilience and the selfless actions of first responders and neighbors.

In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Levine stated, 'It's unfortunate that the film vilified that, and it's fucking wrong,' admitting he now understands the cultural and gender realities more deeply. He insisted he never portrayed Buffalo Bill as gay or transgender, emphasizing he saw the character as a 'fucked-up heterosexual man' driven by pathology. Saxon echoed the sentiment, saying the filmmakers were loyal to the source material but lacked sensitivity to the harmful legacy of stereotypes, noting, 'We weren't sensitive enough to the legacy of a lot of stereotypes and their ability to harm.' Despite this regret, the article then asserts that transgender individuals are a 'real rising threat,' citing three violent incidents: the 2025 mass shooting in Minneapolis by Robin Westman (assigned male at birth), the 2023 school shooting in Nashville by Audrey Hale (assigned female at birth, identifying as transgender male), and the 2026 mass shooting in British Columbia by Jesse Van Rootselaar (assigned male at birth, transgender). The article claims these cases reflect a 'trans mass shooter pattern' and links them to mental illness, though it does not provide independent verification or data to support the assertion of a pattern.

The shooter, identified as a transgender woman wearing a dress, was confirmed by Canadian police and was found dead at the scene. The father, estranged from Jesse since childhood, stated in a CBC interview: 'I was estranged from Jesse Strang and was not part of his life,' referencing the mother\u2019s surname, Jennifer Strang, who was among the eight killed. He added, 'His mother declined my involvement from the beginning, and I was not given the opportunity to be a part of raising him.' He further expressed sorrow: 'While that distance is the reality of our relationship, it does not lessen the heartbreak I feel for the pain that has been caused to innocent people and to the town we call home.'

Two other students were injured, one critically. According to Steven Rai, a senior analyst at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), Van Rootselaar had accounts on multiple platforms, including Reddit, YouTube, Roblox, and WatchPeopleDie\u2014a site linked to two prior school shootings. Rai reported that Van Rootselaar discussed severe mental illness, including depression, obsessive-compulsive disorder, autism, and a psychotic episode triggered by psychedelic mushrooms. She also admitted to being 'addicted' to violent content on WatchPeopleDie, describing it as an 'obsessive and compulsive draw.' Van Rootselaar created a Roblox game simulating a mall mass shooting. She had access to firearms and expressed strong interest in guns and gun rights. RCMP noted prior mental health interventions, including apprehension under the Mental Health Act. Despite right-wing media claims linking the violence to Van Rootselaar\u2019s transgender identity, Rai stated there is 'absolutely no reason to believe that their transgender identity had anything to do with this attack.' Rai emphasized that while exposure to violent online content can desensitize viewers, having an account on such sites does not equate to intent to commit violence. He urged policymakers, educators, and parents to invest in mental health support, community cohesion, and early warning sign training in schools to prevent future tragedies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[The Tyee](https://thetyee.ca/News/2026/02/16/Online-Life-Tumbler-Ridge-Shooter/)\n\n**Online activity of Canada school shooter shows a fascination with mass violence and violent content, expert says**\nAn expert analysis of the online activity of Jesse Van Rootselaar, the 18-year-old perpetrator of the deadly shooting at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School in Canada, reveals a growing fascination with firearms, mass violence, and graphic 'gore' content. Van Rootselaar, who died by suicide after the attack, was active on the website WatchPeopleDie, which hosts violent content and has been linked to previous mass shooters, including 15-year-old Natalie Rupnow from Wisconsin. According to Cody Zoschak, a senior manager at the Institute for Strategic Dialogue (ISD), Van Rootselaar\u2019s digital footprint began in 2019 with video game discussions, evolved in 2021 to include a photo of a gun she claimed to own, and intensified in 2023 with posts about drug use and mental health struggles. After a period of inactivity in 2024, she created a WatchPeopleDie account about five months before the attack, where she commented on dozens of gore posts. ISD analysts also identified a mass shooting simulation game on Roblox Studio, linked to Van Rootselaar, which had only seven visits but was removed by Roblox, which stated it is supporting law enforcement. The incident, which killed six people\u2014most under 13\u2014and resulted in the deaths of Van Rootselaar\u2019s 11-year-old brother and mother, is Canada\u2019s deadliest school shooting since 1989.

Van Rootselaar, who had a documented history of mental health concerns and an expired firearms license, was not targeting specific individuals but was 'hunting' for victims, according to RCMP Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald. Police seized two firearms at the school\u2014a long gun and a modified handgun\u2014and a shotgun at the residence, along with 'a number of other firearms.' McDonald stated that the main firearm used in the attack was not among those seized and its origin remains unknown. Although firearms were previously seized from Van Rootselaar\u2019s residence years ago and returned after a court petition, Brian Landry, an RCMP-certified firearms instructor, criticized the system for failing to prevent access to weapons by someone with serious mental health issues. Van Rootselaar later died by suicide after the attack. Van Rootselaar\u2019s mother, Jennifer Strang, had previously posted on social media in 2024 showing rifles in a hunting case with the caption: 'it's time to take them out for some target practice.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 07:26 AM\nSource:[RT](https://www.rt.com/news/632547-canadian-school-shooter-was-hunting/)\n\n**'He tried to kill his family before' - neighbour says Canada school shooter almost burnt down house three years ago**\nJesse Van Rootselaar, a teenager from Tumbler Ridge, Canada, carried out a mass shooting at his home and a local school on February 11, 2026, killing eight people\u2014including his mother, brother, and six others\u2014before turning the gun on himself. According to a neighbor, Melanie, Van Rootselaar had previously attempted to kill his family by setting fire to their home in 2023, an incident that nearly destroyed the wooden-plank house and was witnessed by multiple residents. Melanie stated that the fire was 'dismissed' by police, though authorities have not confirmed the event. Van Rootselaar, who had a documented history of mental health struggles and was transitioning to female, had discussed the arson in a social media post from October 28, 2023, claiming he acted under the influence of psychedelic mushrooms and experienced a 'complete break from reality.' Investigators believe the shooter was 'hunting' victims at the school, not targeting specific individuals. Four unregistered firearms were used\u2014two at the home and two at the school\u2014raising questions about how he accessed them, especially given prior police call-outs related to mental health and firearms. The victims were identified as Zoey Benoit, Ticaria Lampert, Kylie Smith, Abel Mwansa (all 12), Ezekiel Schofield (13), and teacher Shannda Aviugana-Durand (39). Neighbors, including Melanie and Neal Smith, expressed grief and frustration, arguing that the tragedy could have been prevented with earlier mental health intervention and better access to care in rural British Columbia. A candle-lit vigil was held in freezing conditions on February 14, 2026, to honor the victims.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 05:30 AM\nSource:[Irish Independent](https://www.independent.ie/world-news/north-america/he-tried-to-kill-his-family-before-neighbour-says-canada-school-shooter-almost-burnt-down-house-three-years-ago/a757563234.html)\n\n**Canada trans shooter Jesse Van Rootselaar's mom described him as...**\nJesse Van Rootselaar, an 18-year-old high school dropout and transgender individual, carried out the second-worst school shooting in Canadian history on February 14, 2026, killing six people and injuring 25 others at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School after murdering his mother and stepbrother at home. His mother, Jennifer Strang, had expressed concerns about his behavior as early as 2015, describing him as a 'sadistic' 7-year-old who showed 'intense empathy' when others were hurt by others but grinned when hurting his siblings. She noted his 'baby talking' at age almost 8, territorial attachment to her, and questioned whether his issues were her fault. Over time, Van Rootselaar became increasingly obsessed with violent content, creating an account on WatchPeopleDie\u2014a platform known for hosting videos of murders and mass shootings, including the Christchurch attacker\u2019s livestream. He commented on videos of suicide bombers, mass shootings, and cannibalism, using phrases like 'badass,' 'pretty peak way to go,' and 'cool video, pretty neat,' while criticizing the preservation of skin in a video titled 'cooking from human flesh #2.' He referred to police as 'losers,' posted 'Brazilian bacon' on a video of a murdered officer, and listed 'myself' and 'gun control' as enemies. He admitted to being addicted to violent content, acknowledging it likely affected his mental health subconsciously, and admitted it was a 'massive useless time dump' he couldn't escape despite knowing its dangers. The shooting occurred after he had already expressed deep trauma from his stepfather\u2019s suicide, saying he wished his stepfather had died on the noose and calling him a 'loser, useless.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 12:32 PM\nSource:[New York Post](https://nypost.com/2026/02/14/world-news/trans-shooter-jesse-van-rootselaar-was-described-by-mom-as-sadistic-child-became-hooked-to-death-videos-as-teen/)\n\n**Canadian school shooter created \u2018mall massacre simulator\u2019 (VIDEO)**\nJesse Van Rootselaar, an 18-year-old former student at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School in British Columbia, Canada, is accused of carrying out the deadliest school shooting in the province in decades, killing nine people\u2014including his mother, 11-year-old stepbrother, five students, and a teacher\u2014before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound on February 10, 2026. According to reports, Van Rootselaar created a video game on Roblox titled a 'mall massacre simulator,' featuring a blocky, cartoon character shooting others in a shopping mall setting. The game was discovered not by police but by users on the online forum Kiwi Farms, and it had only seven visits before Roblox removed the user account and associated content. Van Rootselaar allegedly maintained a presence on WatchPeopleDie, a forum known for sharing violent death imagery and glorifying mass shooters, as noted by the ADL Center on Extremism. On Reddit, he posted about suicidal thoughts, gender transition, mental health struggles, and a history of psychiatric hospitalizations, including a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder. He had previously started a fire at home while under the influence of psychedelic mushrooms. Police confirmed frequent visits to his family\u2019s home due to mental health concerns. Van Rootselaar held a minor\u2019s firearms license that expired in 2024.

Van Rootselaar, who had begun transitioning from male to female six years prior and publicly identified as female, died from a self-inflicted wound. Officials stated it was too early to determine if her transgender identity played a role in the motive. A widely circulated image purportedly showing the shooter holding an assault rifle was falsely identified as Van Rootselaar. The image was actually a years-old photo of social media influencer William Sexton (aka Vrillium), altered using artificial intelligence to make it appear he was holding a gun. The original image, posted in February 2020, showed Sexton holding a guitar, and the gun in the altered version would have appeared in the mirror behind him if unedited. Sexton denied being the shooter on his Instagram story on February 11, stating, 'Insane I have to say this: No, I'm not the trans shooter from Canada.' The image had previously resurfaced in December 2025 from Sexton\u2019s alternate X accounts. Canadian police released an authentic image of Van Rootselaar on February 11, confirming the circulated image misidentified Sexton. Snopes rated the claim as fake, citing the original photo, Sexton\u2019s statement, and the official police image as evidence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 01:04 AM\nSource:[Snopes](https://www.snopes.com//fact-check/canadian-shooter-rifle-altered-pic/)\n\n**ADL: Van Rootselaar Tweeted 'I Must Hate Jews' Two Days Before the Attack**\nJesse Van Rootselaar, an 18-year-old identified as the perpetrator of a mass shooting at Tumbler Ridge Secondary School in British Columbia, allegedly posted antisemitic tweets two days before the attack. According to the Anti-Defamation League (ADL), Van Rootselaar tweeted, 'I must hate Jews because Zionists want me to hate Jews. It must benefit them in some way.' The ADL also reported that Van Rootselaar exhibited 'concerning online radicalization behavior,' including using WatchPeopleDie, a platform that glorifies violence and has been linked to multiple mass violence incidents. The ADL identified a X (formerly Twitter) account believed to belong to Van Rootselaar, which regularly shared antisemitic and racist content, as well as materials glorifying past mass shooters, including the Buffalo supermarket shooter (2022) and the Christchurch mosque shooter (2019). The attack resulted in eight deaths and numerous injuries, with Van Rootselaar killing six people at the school and two family members at his home before dying from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. The incident occurred on January 30, 2025, near Stanstead, Quebec, where a Canadian Royal Mounted Police officer was patrolling the Canada-U.S. border.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 09:05 PM\nSource:[The Times of Israel FR](https://fr.timesofisrael.com/adl-van-rootselaar-a-tweete-je-dois-detester-les-juifs-2-jours-avant-lattaque/)\n\n**Canadian trans shooter Jesse Van Rootselaar seen wearing makeup in...**\nJesse Van Rootselaar, an 18-year-old Canadian transgender man, was identified as the perpetrator of a mass shooting in Tumbler Ridge, British Columbia, on February 11, 2026. He fatally shot his mother, Jennifer Strang, and his 11-year-old stepbrother at their home before traveling to Tumbler Ridge Secondary School, where he killed a female teacher and five students aged 12\u201313, primarily in the library. He died by suicide at the scene. According to Royal Canadian Mounted Police Deputy Commissioner Dwayne McDonald, Van Rootselaar was 'born a biological male' who began transitioning to female about six years prior and identified as female. A June 2023 post from an archived Reddit thread shows Van Rootselaar in a mirror selfie wearing dark nail polish, red lipstick, foundation, and long hair, with the caption 'First time trying makeup! (Pre-HRT).' One user responded, 'cool beans.' Authorities confirmed he was a former student who dropped out four years earlier. McDonald stated it is 'too early to say' whether his transgender identity was connected to the attack.

The account, under the username 'jesseboy347,' reportedly hosted a game titled 'Remember' that simulated a mall shooting, allowing players to use rifles, ARs, rocket launchers, SMGs, machine guns, and snipers to attack a crowd of civilians in a shopping center setting. Reddit users and the forum Kiwi Farms reported discovering this content, suggesting a potential link between the game and Van Rootselaar\u2019s actions. However, no official confirmation has been provided by Canadian authorities or Roblox regarding the account\u2019s ownership or whether the game influenced the attack. Police confirmed Van Rootselaar acted alone, with the motive still unclear, and she died by suicide at the school after the attack. Van Rootselaar, who was assigned male at birth and transitioned six years prior, is described in the article as having played the game prior to the shooting. While violent video games are common, rare cases exist where such content may inspire real-life violence. The article does not assert causation, but raises concerns about the potential impact of user-generated violent content on vulnerable individuals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 03:31 PM\nSource:[The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/canada-shooter-jesse-van-rootselaar-played-mall-shooting-game-before-killing-multiple-claims-viral-reddit-post/articleshow/128263720.cms)\n\n**Revealed: 6ft trans school shooter wanted to be 'petite'**\nJesse Van Rootselaar, an 18-year-old transgender teenager from Tumbler Ridge, Canada, who was born male, carried out the deadliest school shooting in the country in nearly 40 years on February 12, 2026. He killed his mother, Jennifer Strang, and his 11-year-old stepbrother before traveling to his former school, where he fatally shot eight people\u2014three 12-year-old girls, two boys aged 12 and 13, and a 39-year-old female teacher\u2014before taking his own life. Police confirmed Van Rootselaar had begun transitioning at age 12 and publicly identified as female, though they stated it was 'too early to say' whether his gender identity was linked to the attack. Social media posts retrieved from his deleted accounts revealed he struggled with his 6ft height and expressed a desire to be 'petite', while also showing a fixation on guns and drugs. He posted videos of himself firing a high-powered Desert Eagle handgun and discussing hormone replacement therapy (HRT) and body image. Police reported a history of mental health-related interventions, including multiple mental health act assessments and prior gun seizures from the home, though his gun licence had expired in 2024 and no firearms were legally registered to him. His mother had publicly supported his identity and shared his YouTube content, which featured a transgender flag and footage of target practice. Van Rootselaar also admitted to using psychedelic mushrooms and DMT. Two additional victims, including 12-year-old Maya Gebala, sustained life-threatening injuries. A candlelit vigil was held in the town of 2,400 residents. Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, who has a transgender daughter, called the event 'horrific' and expressed condolences. The incident has sparked national reflection amid Canada\u2019s progressive transgender rights laws and recent provincial efforts to restrict transgender participation in women\u2019s sports.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 11:11 AM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/revealed-6ft-trans-school-shooter-111134210.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
