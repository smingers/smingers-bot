## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Earnings miss and immediate selloff**: Multiple independent sources confirm Q4 revenue of $1.28B missed $1.35B consensus by ~5%. Stock dropped 17% over two days post-earnings (Feb 10-13), closing at $71.12-$71.14. This is a clear negative catalyst with demonstrated market impact.
- **Crypto revenue collapse**: 38% decline in crypto transaction revenue ($221M vs $268M prior quarter) consistently reported across sources. Given crypto represents 17-21% of total revenue, this structural headwind is significant.
- **Analyst consensus remains bullish**: Despite selloff, 14 Buy/2 Hold ratings with consensus target $135.46 (90% upside from $71.14) from identifiable analysts at major firms (Truist, Needham, Piper Sandler, Bernstein). This suggests institutional view that selloff is overdone.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Institutional buying during dip**: Cathie Wood's ARK purchased $12.4M on Feb 13 at $71.12, signaling contrarian institutional confidence. Single large buyer, but Wood is identifiable expert with track record.
- **Recent price action**: Stock fell from $86.56 (Feb 9) to $71.14 (Feb 13) to $75.97 (Feb 16), showing 6.8% recovery from lows. Suggests some stabilization after initial shock.
- **Prediction markets growth**: Multiple sources cite record $3.5B January volumes and Q4 doubling, representing new revenue stream diversification. Positive but early-stage.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Single analyst bearish opinion**: Di Pizio's "more doom and gloom" prediction is one voice against consensus.
- **Technical indicators**: References to moving averages and momentum are short-term/volatile.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 8 trading days (Feb 17 close → Feb 27 close)

**Current context**: 
- Feb 17 baseline: ~$75.97 (last reported close Feb 16)
- Recent trajectory: Down 17% post-earnings (Feb 10-13), then +6.8% recovery (Feb 13-16)
- Macro calendar: Fed minutes (Feb 19), PCE data (Feb 21), earnings season winding down

**If timeframe halved (4 days)**: Would weight recent momentum more heavily. The 6.8% bounce from $71.14 to $75.97 suggests short-term buying pressure. Probability of positive return would increase to ~58-60% as mean reversion from oversold conditions dominates.

**If timeframe doubled (16 days)**: Would weight structural factors (crypto headwinds, earnings miss) more heavily. Analyst targets ($135+) suggest medium-term upside, but execution risk increases. Probability might shift to 52-54% as both recovery potential and downside risk balance out over longer period.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view base rate**: 54% (8-day positive return probability from historical HOOD data)

**Key factors warranting adjustment:**

1. **Recent negative catalyst absorption** (Moderate upward shift, +3-4pp): The stock absorbed a major earnings miss and fell 17% in two days, then recovered 6.8%. This suggests the worst news is priced in. Historical pattern shows HOOD often overshoots on bad news then recovers.

2. **Institutional buying signal** (Small upward shift, +1-2pp): ARK's $12.4M purchase at $71.12 and strong analyst consensus (14 Buy ratings, $135 average target) suggest smart money views current levels as attractive. This is contrarian evidence against further decline.

3. **Crypto headwind uncertainty** (Small downward shift, -2pp): The 38% crypto revenue decline is structural, not transient. If crypto markets remain weak through Feb 27, this could pressure the stock. However, this is already reflected in the post-earnings selloff.

4. **Mean reversion from oversold** (Moderate upward shift, +2-3pp): Stock is 50% below October 2025 highs and trading near June 2024 lows despite improved fundamentals (2025 revenue +52%, profitable). Technical oversold conditions favor bounce.

**Net adjustment**: +4 to +6 percentage points from 54% base rate

The current circumstances differ meaningfully from the historical reference class because:
- We're immediately post-earnings (catalyst absorbed) rather than mid-cycle
- Analyst consensus is unusually bullish despite recent weakness
- Stock has already fallen 50% from highs, reducing downside risk
- Institutional buying provides concrete support level around $71

However, the crypto headwind is a genuine structural concern that prevents a larger upward shift.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from 54% outside view base rate:
- Recent selloff absorption and recovery: +3pp
- Institutional buying/analyst support: +2pp  
- Mean reversion from oversold: +2pp
- Crypto headwind uncertainty: -2pp

**Inside view prediction: 59%**

This reflects modest confidence that the post-earnings selloff has created a short-term buying opportunity, supported by institutional activity and analyst consensus, but tempered by genuine concerns about crypto revenue weakness.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will HOOD close higher on Feb 27, 2026 than its Feb 17, 2026 close? 8 trading days, comparing two specific closing prices.

2. **Base rate**: Outside view established 54% probability for positive 8-day HOOD returns. My 59% prediction represents a +5pp shift, justified by post-earnings recovery dynamics and institutional support.

3. **Consistency check**: "59 out of 100 times, HOOD closes higher on Feb 27 than Feb 17." This makes sense given recent oversold bounce, institutional buying, and analyst support, while acknowledging crypto headwinds create meaningful downside risk.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Q4 earnings miss ($1.28B vs $1.35B) caused 17% selloff, now partially recovered (+6.8%)
   - Cathie Wood's ARK bought $12.4M at $71.12 on Feb 13, signaling institutional support
   - 14 analyst Buy ratings with $135 consensus target (90% upside) despite recent weakness
   - Crypto revenue fell 38% to $221M, representing structural headwind
   - Stock trading near 2024 lows despite improved 2025 fundamentals (revenue +52%)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Crypto markets experience another sharp decline (Bitcoin breaks below $60K) during the Feb 17-27 window, triggering renewed selling pressure in crypto-exposed stocks including HOOD. This could push probability down to 45-48%.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Current status quo is a recovering bounce from post-earnings lows. If this recovery stalls and stock drifts sideways around $75-76, the 8-day window is short enough that small random movements dominate, keeping probability near 50-55%. My 59% assumes modest continuation of the recovery trend.

Probability: 59%
