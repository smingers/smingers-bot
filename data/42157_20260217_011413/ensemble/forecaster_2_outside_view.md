## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **10-trading-day returns for HOOD stock specifically** - Most relevant but limited data
   - Suitability: HIGH - Most direct comparison
   - Available data: Recent 7-day return was -20.5% (Feb 2-13), suggesting high volatility period

2. **10-trading-day returns for high-beta growth stocks (Beta ~2.4)** - Broader category
   - Suitability: MEDIUM-HIGH - Captures volatility characteristics
   - HOOD's beta of 2.44 suggests 2.4x market volatility; S&P down 1.3% in recent month suggests modest volatility environment

3. **Fintech stock 10-trading-day returns during correction periods** - Sector-specific
   - Suitability: MEDIUM - Captures sector dynamics but less specific
   - Current context: HOOD described as "in middle of market correction"

4. **Random walk / coin flip for any 10-trading-day period** - Baseline
   - Suitability: LOW - Ignores momentum, volatility, and market context
   - Would suggest ~50% probability

**Selected reference class: 10-trading-day returns for HOOD and high-beta growth stocks**

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 10 trading days (2026-02-17 close to 2026-02-27 close)

**Historical patterns:**
- HOOD has shown extreme volatility: 52-week range of $29.66-$153.86 (5.2x range)
- Recent pattern (Jan-Feb 2026): Sharp decline from $104 to $76 (~27% drop in 2-3 weeks)
- The stock just experienced a -20.5% move in 7 trading days (Feb 2-13)
- Agent report notes 2024-2025 contained multiple 7-day moves of ±20-40%
- Current price $75.97 is near recent lows ($71.12 low, $77.08 recent high)

**Market context:**
- S&P 500 down modestly (-1.3% over 1 month)
- Dense macro calendar ahead: FOMC minutes (Feb 18), GDP revision (Feb 20), PPI (Feb 27), durable goods (Feb 26)
- High-beta stocks like HOOD (2.44 beta) amplify market moves

## (d) Justification

**Key factors for outside view:**

1. **Mean reversion tendency:** After a sharp 27% decline from $104 to $76, the stock is near recent support at $71.12. Historically, extreme moves are often followed by partial reversals or consolidation.

2. **High volatility environment:** Beta of 2.44 and recent -20.5% 7-day move indicate continued high volatility is likely. A 10-day period could easily see ±10-20% moves.

3. **Technical position:** At $75.97, HOOD is only 6.8% above its recent low of $71.12 and 35% below its recent high of $123.24. This suggests more room to move up than down in percentage terms.

4. **Macro event density:** The heavy calendar of economic releases (especially late in the period with PPI on Feb 27) creates multiple catalysts for volatility. These could move markets either direction.

5. **Momentum consideration:** The sharp recent decline suggests negative momentum, but the stock has shown resilience by not breaking below $71 despite the selloff.

6. **No company-specific events:** Absence of earnings or corporate events reduces idiosyncratic risk, making this primarily a market-beta and sentiment play.

**Base rate considerations:**
- For a random 10-trading-day period, a stock might have ~50% chance of closing higher
- However, after a sharp decline, mean reversion suggests slightly elevated probability of bounce
- High volatility increases probability of large moves in either direction
- Current near-support levels suggest asymmetric risk/reward favoring upside

Outside view calibration:

Starting from a 50% baseline for any random period, I adjust:

**Upward adjustments (+8-10%):**
- Mean reversion after 27% decline: +5%
- Near technical support ($71-76 range): +3%
- Asymmetric positioning (closer to lows than highs): +2%

**Downward adjustments (-3-5%):**
- Recent negative momentum: -3%
- Market showing modest weakness: -1%
- "In middle of correction" characterization: -1%

**Net adjustment:** +3-5% above baseline

The dense macro calendar is a wildcard that increases volatility but doesn't clearly favor either direction, so I treat it as neutral for directional bias.

Given:
- High volatility environment (large moves likely)
- Recent oversold conditions (near support)
- Mean reversion tendencies after sharp moves
- No clear negative catalyst in the 10-day window

I estimate a 53-56% probability range. The high volatility and mean reversion pull toward 55-56%, while the negative momentum and correction context pull toward 53-54%.

Outside View Prediction:
54%
