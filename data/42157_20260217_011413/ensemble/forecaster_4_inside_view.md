Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)
1. Motley Fool, 16 Feb 26 – “3 Things Robinhood Must Prove in 2026”.  Mostly commentary; factual items: close $75.97, Q4-25 revenue $1.283 bn.  Medium quality.
2. Markets Insider, 16 Feb 26 – “More Doom and Gloom…”.  Factual: stock –50 % since Oct-25; 28.4 m accounts; record FY-25 rev $4.5 bn/EPS $2.05.  Opinion from named analyst Anthony Di Pizio.  Medium.
3. Parameter & Blockonomi, 16 Feb 26 – identical post-earnings wrap-ups.  Facts: 17 % two-day drop 10–12 Feb; crypto rev –38 % QoQ; consensus PT $135.   High factual reliability (earnings numbers), opinions (price-targets) from named sell-side firms.  Moderate evidence.
4. Finviz deep-dive, 14 Feb 26.  Gives actual Q4 numbers; confirms margin compression and test-net launch.  High factual reliability.
5. Asianet, 13 Feb 26 – “ARK buys dip”.  Fact: ARK bought 174 k shares at $71.12.  Small but verifiable.  Weak-to-moderate evidence of insider confidence.
6. MarketBeat, 9 Feb 26 – earlier rally on analyst upgrade to $125.  Now stale but confirms price was > $80 pre-earnings.  Weak for the coming nine days.

(b) Evidence analysis (weight)
• Strong: none (there is no scheduled company catalyst in the next nine trading days).  
• Moderate (direction-negative):  
  – 17 % post-earnings sell-off driven by revenue miss & crypto rev –38 %.  
  – Continued crypto weakness (BTC < $67 k, –50 % from peak).  
• Moderate (direction-positive):  
  – Stock now –45 % from January high and technically oversold (three-day RSI < 30 on 13 Feb, per Finviz).  
  – Large-beta names often rebound if the broader market drifts up; S&P 500 is in a mild up-trend YTD (+4 %).  
• Weak: ARK’s $12 m purchase; bullish analyst targets (long-term, not 9-day).

Net: slightly more weight to short-term negative momentum & crypto headwind than to bounce potential.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Prediction window = 9 U.S. trading days (17 Feb close ➜ 27 Feb close).  
If the window were halved (4 days) I would cut “Yes” probability ~3 pp (less time for bounce).  
If doubled (18 days) I would raise it ~4 pp (more mean-reversion time).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate for a high-beta S&P 500 constituent being up over 9 days ≈ 53 %.  
Adjust –4 pp for: fresh bearish catalyst (earnings miss, crypto rev drop) and still-weak crypto tape.  
Adjust –2 pp for: downward price momentum (–37 % YTD).  
Add +3 pp for: oversold technicals and broad-market upward drift.  
Net shift ≈ –3 pp from the 53 % base ➜ 50 % – 3 % = 47 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that in roughly 47 out of 100 comparable nine-day windows, HOOD will close higher on day 9 than on day 0.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Between 17 Feb & 27 Feb 2026, will HOOD’s closing price rise?” ✔  
2. Outside view stated 53 %. ✔  
3. Consistency line written above. ✔  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
   – 17 % post-earnings drop shows near-term selling pressure.  
   – Crypto rev –38 % QoQ, BTC still weak.  
   – Stock now ~45 % below Jan high, RSI oversold.  
   – S&P 500 drifting up YTD, beta > 2 may aid bounce.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden crypto rally > 15 % would lift HOOD sharply and make 47 % far too low.  
6. Status-quo outcome (price flat/down) slightly favored; probability nudged toward that side. ✔

Probability: 47%
