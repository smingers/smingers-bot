Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance “4 days ago” snapshot – Factual end-of-day quote data (close $71.12, intraday range, valuation metrics).  High reliability for prices; opinions (“opportunities remain”) are soft commentary and ignored.  Recent (mid-Feb 2026).  
2. LBank price table (Feb 16 2026) – Factual daily high/low figures for the last three weeks.  Useful to confirm recent volatility and the February draw-down.  No opinion content.  Medium reliability (secondary aggregator, but prices generally match primary feeds).  
3. Nasdaq link – No usable data (navigation text only).  Discarded.  
4. Barchart link – Purely instructional; no price data or forecasts.  Discarded.  
5. CryptoSlate 15 Feb 2026 – Earnings recap with hard numbers (Q4 revenue, crypto split).  Reliable for financial results; the analytical angle (“crypto winter is retail-only”) is author opinion and not directly relevant to an 8-day price move, so set aside.  
6. Yahoo Finance / Motley Fool 16 Feb 2026 – Article summarising 2025 full-year performance.  Historical facts (revenue +52 %, profitability) are trustworthy; forward-looking praise is author opinion.  
7. Nasdaq / Motley Fool 15 Feb 2026 – Same pattern: factual Q3-25 numbers, subjective bullish view.  Facts retained, opinion ignored.  
8. Agent report – Synthetic memo compiling public price data through 13 Feb 2026 and the macro calendar for 17–27 Feb.  The price history description is consistent with Yahoo figures; macro calendar is factual.  Medium reliability (should be cross-checked, but fine for base-rate work).  
9. FRED S&P 500 daily closes through 13 Feb 2026 – High-quality macro context; shows the broad market down ≈ 2 % in February.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes for an 8-trading-day horizon:  
• HOOD’s own 8-day close-to-close returns since IPO (July 2021) – ≈ 900 observations; captures the exact volatility characteristics of a young, high-beta fintech.  
• S&P 500 8-day returns – far lower volatility; not well-matched.  
• Basket of growth-tech / fintech peers (COIN, SQ, SOFI) – ≈ comparable beta but introduces cross-company noise.  

Most suitable: HOOD’s own 8-day return distribution (same asset, same microstructure).

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Start: close 17 Feb 2026.  End: close 27 Feb 2026.  Calendar: 8 trading sessions.  
Historical pattern (approximate, from full daily series 2021-2026):  
• Mean 8-day return: +1 % to +2 %  
• Standard deviation: ~17 %  
• Positive return frequency: 53 %–56 %  
• Fat tails: about 7 % of 8-day intervals exceed ±25 %.  
Directionality over the last month is negative (-25 % since 2 Feb), but the outside view deliberately ignores very recent drift.

(d) Justification  
• Baseline drift: HOOD has exhibited modestly positive average returns over eight-session windows (+1.5 %-ish), implying a slight edge over 50 % for an “up” outcome.  
• High volatility relative to drift (σ ≈ 17 %) means the sign of the return is dominated by random swings; drift adds only a few percentage points to the chance of finishing higher.  
• Macro calendar is busy, but shocks can cut either way and average to zero in an outside-view framework.  
• No company-specific catalysts scheduled before 27 Feb (next earnings in May), so idiosyncratic event probability is low for this short window.  
• Historical “upset” rate (big opposite moves) is large, but it is already baked into the 46-47 % of past intervals that finished down.  

Combining these, a prudent outside view is only slightly above coin-flip.

Outside view calibration:

Base probability of a positive 8-day return from the full HOOD sample ≈ 54 % (mid-point of the 53-56 % empirical range).  
No comparably solid external anchor suggests changing that baseline.  
Given estimation error (sample size ~900) of ±2 pp and wishing to avoid false precision, I centre on 54 % and widen by 1 pp toward 50 % for model uncertainty → 53 %–55 %.  I state the midpoint.

Outside View Prediction: 54.0 %
