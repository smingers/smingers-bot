Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance quote page (dated “4 days ago”).  Reliable factual snapshot of HOOD’s recent trading range ($71–$77) and valuation metrics; opinions are limited to brief analyst blurbs (“BUY”, raised target).  
2. LBank historical-high/low table (to 15 Feb 2026).  Secondary data feed; confirms the sharp slide from >$100 at the end of January to the mid-$70s by mid-February.  Purely factual price prints.  
3. Nasdaq “historical” page – unusable; no price data.  
4. Barchart feature description – no substantive data on HOOD.  
5. CryptoSlate article (15 Feb 2026).  Fact-rich recap of Q4 results (revenues, crypto slowdown); written by a named journalist.  Opinion content is the narrative about “crypto winter”; those opinions are not germane to a 10-day price move.  
6. Yahoo Finance/Motley Fool article (16 Feb 2026).  Gives historical revenue and profitability figures; opinions (“structural improvement”) come from the author and are longer-term in nature.  
7. Nasdaq/Motley Fool comparison piece (15 Feb 2026).  Contains factual Q3 2025 numbers and author’s bullish view; again, horizon is multi-quarter.  
8. Agent report.  Compiles partial closing-price history, points out the absence of scheduled HOOD-specific events before 27 Feb, and lists the U.S. macro calendar.  Quality: internally generated but methodologically sound; no opinion on direction.  
9. FRED S&P 500 time-series.  Authoritative macro index levels to 13 Feb 2026.

Taken together, the only high-signal facts that directly inform a 10-day price move are:  
• HOOD closed $75.97 on 14 Feb and ~ $76 on 16 Feb.  
• Recent eight-day drop ≈ –20 %.  
None of the articles contain expert short-term forecasts; most opinions are long-term and are therefore set aside for the outside view.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. HOOD’s own 8-trading-day close-to-close returns since its 2021 IPO (≈ 900 observations).  
2. All S&P 500 constituents’ 8-day returns over the last five years (≈ 600,000 observations).  
3. High-beta fintech/growth stocks’ 8-day returns (e.g., COIN, SQ, AFRM) over 2021-26.

Class 1 is the tightest match (same ticker, same horizon) and already embeds HOOD-specific volatility and skew, so I adopt it as the primary reference class.  Where data are missing, I rely on stylised facts of similar high-beta tech stocks (Class 3) to sanity-check dispersion estimates.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Prediction window: close of 17 Feb 2026 to close of 27 Feb 2026 – eight trading sessions.  
Stylised historical pattern for HOOD and peers:  
• Daily σ ≈ 5–6 %.  
• 8-day σ ≈ √8 × 5.5 % ≈ 15–17 %.  
• Mean drift over eight days is small but positive (≈ +1 %), driven by the equity risk premium.  
Empirically, for U.S. equities a slight majority of 8-day periods end positive; for a volatile growth name the observed frequency is typically 52–56 %.

(d) Justification  
Base-rate calculation:  
Assume normalised return R ~ N(μ = +1 %, σ = 16 %).  
P(R > 0) = Φ(μ/σ) ≈ Φ(0.01/0.16) ≈ Φ(0.0625) ≈ 0.525.  
Allowing for fat tails (kurtosis > 3) slightly increases both tails but leaves the centre mass near 0 roughly unchanged – so 52–53 % remains reasonable.  
Historical up-rate for HOOD’s 8-day windows is likely a bit higher because 2024–25 were strongly up years; a crude adjustment adds ~2 percentage points, pushing the base rate toward 54–55 %.  
Macro-event frequency between now and 27 Feb is average; no earnings, no product launches.  Hence, no clear asymmetry that would justify moving far from the historical base.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: 52.5 % (pure drift + volatility model).  
Historical uplift for HOOD’s strong multi-year up-trend: +1.5 %.  
Discount for the stock’s current negative momentum (–20 % over last eight sessions) reverting toward the mean rather than extending lower: +1 % (because mean-reversion slightly favours an uptick).  

Net outside-view probability ≈ 52.5 % + 1.5 % + 1 % = 55 %.  
Acknowledging estimation error (~±3 ppts) and to avoid false precision, I shave 1 ppt back toward 50 % to remain conservative.

Outside View Prediction:
54 %
