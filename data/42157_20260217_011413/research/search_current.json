February 16, 2026  \n**Author:** Lawrence Nga\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- **Transaction revenue composition:** Transaction revenue accounted for 60% of total revenue in Q4 2025, primarily from options and crypto trading\n- **Recent milestone:** Robinhood achieved S&P 500 inclusion in 2025\n- **Stock performance note:** HOOD was up 6.82% (context from article header)\n- **Current close price:** $75.97 as of February 16, 2026 (from background information)\n\n## Main Themes and Analysis:\n\nThe article argues that 2026 represents a transition year for Robinhood, where the company must prove it can \"stabilize, integrate, and scale with discipline\" rather than simply demonstrate growth.\n\n**Three Key Areas to Watch:**\n\n1. **Recurring Revenue Growth:** The company needs to shift away from transaction-dependent revenue (which creates earnings volatility) toward more stable recurring income sources like Gold subscriptions, net interest income, and securities lending\n\n2. **Earnings Volatility Reduction:** As an S&P 500 company, Robinhood needs more predictable quarterly results that are less dependent on crypto and options trading activity swings\n\n3. **Product Ecosystem Integration:** Recent product launches (Gold Card, tokenized stocks in Europe, crypto wallets, prediction markets, cash management tools) need to work together cohesively rather than exist as fragmented offerings\n\n## Author's Opinion:\n\nThe author suggests that if Robinhood successfully expands recurring revenue, reduces volatility, and strengthens ecosystem depth, \"the transformation gains credibility.\" However, failure to do so means the company \"risks remaining tied to market cycles.\" The article frames 2026 as a test of whether Robinhood can transition \"from momentum-driven growth to disciplined compounding.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://evrimagaci.org/gpt/midnight-and-robinhood-unveil-blockchain-innovations-for-2026-528832\">\n# Summary of

Despite this, the stock price has declined nearly 50% since early October 2025. Investor Anthony Di Pizio attributes the downturn to investor sentiment, noting that Robinhood\u2019s user base\u2014predominantly young, first-time, active traders\u2014tends to withdraw during market downturns. He draws a parallel between the 2021 and 2025 market rallies, both driven by speculative investing, particularly in cryptocurrencies, which boosted Robinhood\u2019s crypto revenue in 2021. Di Pizio warns that with crypto revenues likely declining again, similar to the 2022 downturn, Robinhood\u2019s stock could face further downside, especially given its current valuation above its historic price-to-sales ratio. He forecasts 'even more downside from here.' In contrast, Wall Street maintains a Strong Buy consensus with 14 Buys and 2 Holds, and a 12-month average price target of $135.46, implying nearly 80% upside.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 09:09 PM\nSource:[Markets Insider](https://markets.businessinsider.com/news/stocks/more-doom-and-gloom-says-investor-about-robinhood-stock-1035832279)\n\n**Robinhood (HOOD) Stock: Analysts See 90% Upside After Post-Earnings Plunge**\nRobinhood (HOOD) stock declined 17% over two trading sessions following its Q4 earnings release on February 10, 2026, after revenue of $1.28 billion missed the $1.35 billion consensus, despite EPS of $0.66 beating estimates of $0.63. The decline was driven by a 38% drop in crypto transaction revenue to $221 million, due to sharply lower digital asset trading volumes. Crypto accounted for roughly 17% of Q4 revenue, making the drop particularly impactful. User growth stagnated, net deposits weakened, and options and equities trading momentum declined. Despite the selloff, analysts maintained a bullish stance: Truist\u2019s David Smith cut his price target to $120 (68.7% upside), Needham\u2019s John Todaro lowered his to $100 (40.6% upside), Piper Sandler\u2019s Patrick Moley reduced his to $135 (89.8% upside), and Bernstein SocGen reaffirmed an Outperform rating with a $160 target (125.8% upside). The consensus price target across analysts is $135.46, implying 90.5% upside from the Friday close of $71.14. The stock is down 37% year-to-date, having traded above $100 earlier in 2026. A bright spot was prediction markets, which hit a record $3.5 billion in January contract volumes. The TipRanks consensus shows 14 Buy and 2 Hold ratings, with no Sell recommendations. Bernstein noted crypto operations contributed 21% of total revenue year-to-date in 2025, increasing the company\u2019s sensitivity to digital asset market swings.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 03:00 PM\nSource:[Parameter](https://parameter.io/robinhood-hood-stock-analysts-see-90-upside-after-post-earnings-plunge/)\n\n**Robinhood (HOOD) Stock: Buy the Dip or Is Another Drop Coming?**\nRobinhood (HOOD) shares dropped 17% over two days following its Q4 earnings report on February 10, 2026, despite beating EPS expectations at $0.66 versus the $0.63 consensus. Revenue of $1.28 billion missed the $1.35 billion Wall Street forecast by $70 million, primarily due to a 38% decline in crypto transaction revenue to $221 million, driven by weak trading volumes in digital assets. Crypto represented about 17% of Q4 revenue, making the shortfall impactful. December data showed stalled user growth and weakened net deposits, while options and equities trading momentum also softened. Analysts cut price targets but maintained Buy ratings: Truist\u2019s David Smith reduced his target to $120 (68.7% upside), Needham\u2019s John Todaro to $100 (40.6% upside), and Piper Sandler\u2019s Patrick Moley to $135 (89.8% upside). All three analysts cited long-term potential despite near-term volatility. A key bright spot was prediction market volumes, which hit a record $3.5 billion in January, signaling strong growth potential. Bernstein SocGen Group maintained an Outperform rating with a $160 target, noting the stock is approaching an 'attractive valuation zone' and that crypto operations accounted for 21% of year-to-date 2025 revenue. The TipRanks consensus includes 14 Buy and 2 Hold ratings, with no Sell ratings; the average price target of $135.46 implies 90.5% upside from the $71.14 closing price.

The model's signal snapshot shows a sharp drop in both MACD and RSI, indicating waning short-term momentum.

The platform holds $51 billion in crypto assets under custody and $232 billion in crypto notional trading volume over the past 12 months. Equity and options trading volumes remain elevated year-over-year, though month-to-month figures have softened, reflecting the cyclical nature of retail participation.
