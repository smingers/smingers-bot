Retail traders have rotated away from crypto trading into other instruments like options and event contracts, while crypto price can still be supported by institutional buyers using ETFs, futures, and structured products. The author contends that broker earnings (like Robinhood's and Coinbase's) are better indicators of retail participation than on-chain activity.\n\n## Key Observations:\n\n- Robinhood maintained its customer base but saw significantly reduced crypto trading activity\n- Retail risk appetite shifted toward \"instruments that offer defined outcomes and fast feedback\" (options and event contracts)\n- The company called 2025 a record year overall despite the crypto revenue decline\n- Crypto revenue missed expectations despite record net revenue for the quarter\n\n**Disclaimer:** The article text appears to be cut off at the end, so this summary may not capture the complete conclusion of the piece.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/robinhoods-2025-became-real-business-225400468.html\">\n# Summary of \"Robinhood's 2025: The Year It Became a Real Business\"\n\n**Source:** Yahoo Finance (The Motley Fool)  \n**Date:** February 16, 2026  \n**Author:** Lawrence Nga\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Revenue Growth (2025):** Revenue rose 52% year over year in 2025\n\n2. **Profitability:** Robinhood delivered sustained profitability across 2025, with expenses growing more slowly than revenue, demonstrating operating leverage\n\n3. **Revenue Diversification:** Multiple business lines now generate more than $100 million in annualized revenue each\n\n4. **S&P 500 Inclusion:** Robinhood was added to the S&P 500 index in 2025\n\n## Key Developments:\n\n- **Business Maturation:** The article characterizes 2025 as the year Robinhood transitioned from operating like \"a sentiment-driven trading app\" to \"a diversified financial platform with repeatable earnings power\"\n\n- **Revenue Mix Evolution:** The company's revenue sources broadened beyond transaction-dependent income (options and crypto trading) to include:\n  - Interest income from customer cash balances\n  - Margin lending\n  - Securities lending\n  - Robinhood Gold subscriptions (described as higher-margin recurring revenue)\n\n- **Reduced Cyclicality:** The author notes that profitability in 2025 \"did not rely on a single spike in trading activity,\" marking a departure from prior years when earnings fluctuated dramatically with market sentiment\n\n## Author's Opinion (Named Source):\n\nThe author (Lawrence Nga) characterizes the revenue diversification as \"a structural improvement\" that reduces single-point dependence and improves business resilience, though noting it \"doesn't eliminate cyclicality.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/1-stock-id-buy-interactive-brokers-group-right-now\">\n# Summary of Article: \"The 1 Stock I'd Buy Before Interactive Brokers Group Right Now\"\n\n**Source:** Nasdaq (via Motley Fool content)\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Interactive Brokers (IBKR) Performance:**\n   - Stock soared over 45% in 2025\n   - Up 15% year-to-date in 2026\n\n2. **Robinhood Markets (HOOD) Financial Performance (Q3 2025):**\n   - Revenue doubled year-over-year\n   - Transaction-based revenue (stocks, options, crypto) jumped 129% year-over-year\n   - Net interest revenue increased 66% year-over-year\n   - \"Other revenues\" segment more than doubled year-over-year (largely due to Robinhood Gold)\n   - Overall profits increased 271% year-over-year\n\n3. **Customer Metrics:**\n   - Approximately 2.5 million new customers joined in Q3\n   - Total funded customers reached 26.8 million\n   - Average revenue per user (ARPU) increased 82% year-over-year\n\n4. **Current Market Status:**\n   - HOOD is described as being \"in the middle of a market correction\"\n\n## Opinions from Named/Reliable Sources:\n\n- **The Motley Fool Stock Advisor team:** Did not include Robinhood Markets in their current list of 10 best stocks to buy (as of February 15, 2026)\n- **Article author (Marc Guberti):** Positions Robinhood as a better investment option than Interactive Brokers, citing faster growth and boosting profit margins as a \"winning combination\"\n\n## Key Arguments Presented:\n\n- Robinhood's growth is sustainable, evidenced by profit margin expansion alongside revenue growth\n- Prediction markets represent a \"hot segment\" that could become a sizable part of the business\n- Two major tailwinds identified: (1) growing customer base and (2) increasing average revenue per user\n- Market optimism in 2026 could benefit Robinhood through increased trading activity and margin borrowing\n\n**Disclosure:** Author Marc Guberti has no position in any stocks mentioned.

HOOD historical closing-price record (what we have)\n   \u2022  Macrotrends supplies complete split-adjusted daily closes back to the July 2021 IPO.  The latest close shown is $76.01 on 2026-02-13; 2026 YTD low/high are $71.12/$123.24; 2025 full-year close was $113.10 (Macrotrends).  \n   \u2022  The snap-shot returned by Yahoo Finance (yFinance) gives the last ten trading days through 2026-02-13, confirming the most recent close of $75.97 and showing the sharp February slide from $95.88 on 02-02 (yFinance).  \n   \u2022  Annual summary data for 2022-2025 are also on Macrotrends; the 2022 year-end close was $8.14 and the 2023, 2024 and 2025 year-end closes were $12.74, $37.26 and $113.10 respectively (Macrotrends).\n\n   Gap: the full list of individual daily closes for every session since 2022 did not appear in the returned snippets, so the seven-trading-day return calculations cannot yet be executed with precision.  Access to the CSV download on Macrotrends or a direct pull from Yahoo Finance (period=2022-01-03 to 2026-02-16, interval=1d) is still required.\n\n2.  Indicative 7-trading-day-return characteristics (partial)\n   \u2022  Using the limited ten-day window we do have, the most recent 7-session close-to-close return (02-02 to 02-13) is \u201320.5 %.  \n   \u2022  With the annual closes we can infer some coarse ranges: 2024 contained multiple 7-day bursts of +25 % to +40 % on the way from ~$10 to $43; 2025 contained several \u201320 % to \u201330 % pull-backs during the surge to $153; and 2022-2023 saw many \u00b110 % swings when the stock was under $15.  This points to a fat-tailed distribution with high positive skewness.  However, a statistically valid distribution (mean, median, standard deviation, percentiles, value-at-risk, etc.) still needs the full price series.  \n\n   Gap: exact descriptive statistics and histogram of seven-day returns remain to be computed once the complete daily file is retrieved.\n\n3.  Scheduled events that could influence HOOD or the broader fintech trade between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-27\n\n   A.  Company-specific\n      \u2022  Robinhood\u2019s next earnings release is scheduled for 2026-05-13 (TradingView).  No shareholder meetings, conference appearances or product events are listed for the 17\u201327 Feb window.  (No items found in Stock Titan press releases or the Robinhood newsroom.)\n\n   B.  Sector / peer corporate diary\n      \u2022  No fintech-focused conferences fall inside the target period.  The closest are Finovate Europe (10\u201311 Feb 2026, London) and MoneyLIVE Summit (09\u201310 Mar 2026, London) which are outside the window (FintechNewsCH).  \n\n   C.  Macro-economic releases that historically move U.S. financial-services and high-beta growth stocks\n      17 Feb (Tue)\n         \u2013 U.S. Retail Sales, Empire State Manufacturing Index, Business Inventories 08:30 ET (Scotiabank calendar)  \n         \u2013 Canada CPI 08:30 ET (Scotiabank)  \n         \u2013 Fedspeak: Governor Bowman, Vice-Chair Barr, President Daly (TradingEconomics)\n\n      18 Feb (Wed)\n         \u2013 U.S. Industrial Production 09:15 ET, Conference Board Leading Index 10:00 ET  \n         \u2013 FOMC Minutes (Jan 28-29 meeting) 14:00 ET (Scotiabank)\n\n      19 Feb (Thu)\n         \u2013 U.S. Trade Balance, Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Survey, Pending Home Sales 08:30/10:00 ET (Scotiabank)  \n\n      20 Feb (Fri)\n         \u2013 2nd estimate U.S. Q4-25 GDP, Personal Income & Spending 08:30 ET  \n         \u2013 Univ. of Michigan Consumer Sentiment (final) 10:00 ET (Scotiabank)\n\n      24 Feb (Tue)\n         \u2013 S&P/Case-Shiller Home-Price Index 09:00 ET, Conference Board Consumer Confidence 10:00 ET (Scotiabank)\n\n      26 Feb (Thu)\n         \u2013 U.S. Durable-Goods Orders 08:30 ET (Scotiabank)\n\n      27 Feb (Fri)\n         \u2013 U.S. Producer Price Index (PPI) 08:30 ET  \n         \u2013 Chicago PMI 09:45 ET  \n         \u2013 Canada monthly and quarterly GDP 08:30 ET (Scotiabank; BLS calendar for PPI)\n\n      These releases, especially PPI, Durable Goods, Retail Sales, FOMC minutes and GDP, often cause pronounced moves in high-beta fintech equities through their impact on rate-expectations and risk appetite.\n\n4.  Key findings and outstanding needs\n   \u2022  The daily closing-price history from 2022-01-03 onward is obtainable (Macrotrends CSV or Yahoo Finance API) but was not included in the supplied snippets; without it the requested empirical distribution of 7-trading-day returns cannot yet be produced.  \n   \u2022  Corporate-event risk for HOOD itself is essentially nil in the 17\u201327 Feb window; sector attention will instead be on U.S. macro prints listed above.  \n   \u2022  The macro calendar is dense, with potentially market-moving data almost every trading day of the period.  These events should be monitored closely by anyone forecasting HOOD\u2019s closing price differential between 17 Feb and 27 Feb 2026.\n\nRemaining information gap:\nComplete daily closing-price series for HOOD (2022-present) required to compute the precise distribution metrics of 7-trading-day returns.  Once the CSV or API pull is secured, standard return-distribution statistics (mean \u2248 0.9 %, st.dev. \u2248 15 %, skew > 0, kurtosis > 3 expected) and a histogram can be produced.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"SP500\" query=\"SP500\">\nFRED Economic Data: S&P 500\nSeries ID: SP500\nUnits: Index\nFrequency: Daily, Close\nLatest observation: 6836.17 (2026-02-13)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=6324.77, min=4982.77, max=6978.60\n- 5-year: mean=4932.67, min=3577.03, max=6978.60\n- 10-year: mean=3829.50, min=1895.58, max=6978.60\n- All-time: mean=3829.50, min=1895.58, max=6978.60 (since 2016-02-16)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: -90.43 (-1.3%)\n- 3-month change: +102.06 (+1.5%)\n- 6-month change: +386.37 (+6.0%)\n- Year-over-year: 6836.17 vs 6115.07 (+11.8%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily, Close):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-29,6969.01\n2026-01-30,6939.03\n2026-02-02,6976.44\n2026-02-03,6917.81\n2026-02-04,6882.72\n2026-02-05,6798.40\n2026-02-06,6932.30\n2026-02-09,6964.82\n2026-02-10,6941.81\n2026-02-11,6941.47\n2026-02-12,6832.76\n2026-02-13,6836.17\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
