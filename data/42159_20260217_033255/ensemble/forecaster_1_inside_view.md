## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE (Multiple independent sources, clear causal mechanisms):**

1. **Book release Feb 17 = Day 1 of forecast window** (CBS, Excélsior, 20minutes, Liverpool Echo)
   - Direct causal mechanism: Release day typically marks peak publicity, followed by decline
   - Current Google Trends: Already at 70 on Feb 17, down from 100 on Feb 15
   - Implication: We're starting measurement at elevated level, post-peak

2. **Major U.S. media appearances Feb 14-15** (NPR, CBS, BBC Newsnight)
   - NPR interview Feb 15 (2.4M listeners)
   - CBS Sunday Morning Feb 15 (5.2M viewers)
   - BBC Newsnight Feb 14-15
   - Direct correlation: Feb 15 = Google Trends peak of 100
   - Implication: Peak publicity already occurred BEFORE forecast window

3. **London event Feb 20** (Radio France, 20minutes)
   - Kate Winslet and Kristin Scott Thomas reading excerpts
   - Emma Thompson audiobook promotion
   - Date: Within forecast window (Feb 17-26)
   - Implication: **CRITICAL FACTOR** - Could drive secondary spike or sustain interest

4. **Extensive international tour schedule** (Franceinfo, 20minutes)
   - Hamburg, Munich, Madrid, Barcelona, NYC, plus French cities
   - Most events occur AFTER Feb 26 (March onwards)
   - Implication: Limited impact on Feb 17-26 window

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**

5. **Viral NYT podcast (2M views in 24 hours)** (Franceinfo, Feb 14)
   - Demonstrates strong social media amplification potential
   - Occurred before forecast window
   - Implication: Contributed to Feb 15 peak, unlikely to repeat

6. **HBO documentary announcement** (Multiple sources)
   - Release "early 2026" - timing unclear
   - Could generate additional coverage if released during window
   - Implication: Low probability of impact on Feb 17-26

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**

7. **Theater productions** (Fib.no, Piccolo Teatro)
   - Events in May-June 2026, outside window
   - Limited relevance to Google search trends

8. **Personal life updates** (Closermag.fr)
   - New relationship, relocation
   - Human interest angle, but unlikely to drive search spikes

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 9 days (Feb 17-26, 2026)

**Current Position:**
- Feb 17 (Day 1): Value = 70
- Feb 15 (2 days ago): Peak = 100
- We're measuring change from 70 (Feb 17) to Feb 26 value

**Key Events Within Window:**
- Feb 17: Book release day (Day 1)
- Feb 20: London event with Winslet/Scott Thomas (Day 4)
- Feb 18-26: Post-release period (Days 2-10)

**If Timeframe Halved (4.5 days, Feb 17-21):**
- Would include Feb 20 London event
- Less time for post-peak decay
- Higher probability of "Doesn't change" (50-60%) as Feb 20 event could sustain ~70 level
- Lower probability of "Decreases" (30-40%)

**If Timeframe Doubled (18 days, Feb 17-Mar 7):**
- Would include Madrid/Barcelona tour (first week March)
- Much more time for decay toward baseline
- "Decreases" probability would increase to 85-90%
- Baseline reversion almost certain over 18 days

**Critical Consideration:** The Feb 20 London event is the ONLY major scheduled event within the Feb 17-26 window. This is 3 days after measurement start, giving time for:
- Days 1-3 (Feb 17-19): Natural post-peak decline
- Day 4 (Feb 20): Potential spike from London event
- Days 5-10 (Feb 21-26): Continued decline or stabilization

## (d) Justification

**Outside View Base Rates:**
- Increases: 8%
- Doesn't change: 17%
- Decreases: 75%

**Factors Supporting DECREASE (reinforcing 75% base rate):**

1. **Peak already passed:** Feb 15 = 100 represents maximum publicity from pre-release interviews. Starting at 70 on Feb 17 means we're already in decline phase.

2. **Typical post-release pattern:** Book releases usually see declining interest after initial publicity burst. The 9-day window extends well beyond typical release-day coverage.

3. **Historical precedent:** December 2024 verdict created spike that dissipated within 2-3 weeks. Current spike (Feb 13-17) follows similar pattern.

4. **Magnitude of elevation:** Value of 70 is 14.6x the 90-day mean (4.8). Such extreme elevations rarely sustain without new major events.

5. **Limited U.S. events:** After Feb 17 release, no major U.S. media scheduled until international tour (mostly March+).

**Factors Supporting INCREASE (challenging 8% base rate):**

1. **Feb 20 London event:** High-profile celebrity involvement (Winslet, Scott Thomas, Thompson) could generate viral coverage and drive U.S. searches.

2. **Audiobook release:** Emma Thompson narration could create secondary publicity wave.

3. **Social media amplification:** NYT podcast got 2M views in 24 hours, showing viral potential.

4. **Review cycle:** Major book reviews typically publish 2-7 days after release, potentially driving Feb 18-24 coverage.

**Factors Supporting NO CHANGE (challenging 17% base rate):**

1. **Feb 20 event timing:** Could perfectly offset natural decline, keeping value near 70.

2. **Sustained international coverage:** Multiple language releases and tour announcements could maintain baseline interest.

3. **±3 point threshold:** Provides buffer - value could decline to 67-73 and still resolve "Doesn't change."

**Justification for Shifts:**

The outside view 75% for "Decreases" is well-justified by:
- Clear post-peak positioning (100→70 already shows decline)
- Typical decay patterns after publicity spikes
- Limited major events in window

However, the Feb 20 London event is a **significant factor not fully captured in outside view**. This event:
- Features A-list celebrities (Winslet, Scott Thomas)
- Occurs midway through forecast window (Day 4 of 10)
- Could generate U.K./international coverage that drives U.S. searches
- Hamburg event sold 1,000 tickets in 48 hours, showing strong European interest

This warrants:
- **Modest increase in "Doesn't change"** from 17%→25% (offsetting forces scenario)
- **Modest increase in "Increases"** from 8%→12% (if London event goes viral)
- **Corresponding decrease in "Decreases"** from 75%→63%

The shift is moderate (not large) because:
- London event is U.K.-focused, may not drive U.S. searches significantly
- We're still starting from elevated position (70), making further increase difficult
- Natural decay momentum is strong after Feb 15 peak
- Most tour events occur AFTER Feb 26

## Probability Calibration

**Status Quo Continuation:**
If current trend continues (decline from 100→70), Feb 26 value would be ~40-50, clearly triggering "Decreases" resolution.

**Upset Scenarios:**

*For "Increases" (>73):*
- Feb 20 London event generates viral U.S. coverage
- HBO documentary surprise release during window
- Major celebrity endorsement/social media moment
- Estimated probability: 12% (up from 8% outside view)

*For "Doesn't change" (67-73):*
- Feb 20 event sustains interest at ~70 level
- Steady review cycle balances natural decline
- International coverage maintains baseline
- Estimated probability: 25% (up from 17% outside view)

*For "Decreases" (<67):*
- Natural post-peak decay continues
- Feb 20 event has minimal U.S. impact
- Return toward baseline (4.8) begins
- Estimated probability: 63% (down from 75% outside view)

**Confidence Check:**
- 63% = 1.7:1 odds for decrease - feels appropriate given strong decay momentum but Feb 20 uncertainty
- 25% = 1:3 odds for no change - reasonable given ±3 buffer and possible offsetting forces
- 12% = 1:7.3 odds for increase - low but non-zero given celebrity event potential

**Volatility Assessment:**
Google Trends can be volatile, but directional trends (post-peak decline) are reliable. The Feb 20 event introduces meaningful uncertainty but doesn't fundamentally change the post-peak trajectory.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Google Trends value for "gisele pelicot" on Feb 26 be >3 points higher (Increases), ±3 points (Doesn't change), or >3 points lower (Decreases) than Feb 17 value of 70?

2. **Base rate:** Outside view: Decreases 75%, Doesn't change 17%, Increases 8%. Final prediction shifts moderately due to Feb 20 London event but remains rooted in post-peak decline pattern.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = Decreases (63%); Least likely = Increases (12%). This aligns with post-peak positioning and limited major U.S. events in window.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Feb 15 peak (100) already passed before window starts - VERIFIED
   - Feb 17 value (70) shows decline already underway - VERIFIED
   - Feb 20 London celebrity event could sustain/boost interest - VERIFIED
   - Typical post-release decay pattern applies - HISTORICAL PATTERN
   - 70 is 14.6x baseline, suggesting mean reversion - VERIFIED

5. **Blind spot:** Feb 20 London event generates unexpected viral U.S. coverage (celebrity moment, controversial statement, social media amplification), driving searches above 73. This would make "Increases" correct. Probability: ~12% already accounts for this.

6. **Status quo:** Natural decay from 70→50 over 9 days is status quo. Feb 20 event could disrupt this, but world changes slowly - slight nudge toward "Decreases" is appropriate. Current 63% feels right.

7. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs, all between 0-100.

Probabilities: [12, 25, 63]
