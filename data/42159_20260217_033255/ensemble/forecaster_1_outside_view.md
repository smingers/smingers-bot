- Identifies key event: February 17, 2026 - U.S. release of "A Hymn to Life" memoir
- Audiobook narrated by Emma Thompson (2.8M Instagram followers)
- Pre-launch coverage: CBS Sunday Morning (5.2M viewers), NPR (2.4M listeners), AP/AFP wire (15M reach)
- Estimated 20-30 million first-week U.S. impressions
- No other U.S. events scheduled Feb 17-26

**Google Trends Data:**
- Current value (Feb 17): 70
- 90-day mean: 4.8 (indicating Pelicot is typically low-interest)
- Recent spike: Feb 15 = 100 (peak), Feb 16 = 54, Feb 17 = 70
- Base rate: 77% of 9-day windows show ≤3 point change
- Recent trend: sharply increasing (last 7 days avg: 51.7 vs prior 7 days: 1.6)

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **High-profile memoir releases by sexual assault survivors:**
   - Relevant because Pelicot's case mirrors this pattern
   - Typically see spike on release day, gradual decline over following week
   - Examples: Christine Blasey Ford, other #MeToo figures

2. **International news figures with U.S. book releases:**
   - Pelicot is French but has global recognition
   - U.S. interest may be secondary to European coverage
   - Book releases typically generate 3-7 day publicity cycles

3. **Google Trends patterns for Gisèle Pelicot specifically:**
   - Most suitable reference class given available data
   - Shows typical baseline near 0-3
   - Major spikes around trial verdict (December 2024) and recent media appearances
   - Current spike (Feb 13-17) shows values: 5→12→53→68→100→54→70

**Selected Reference Class:** Gisèle Pelicot's own Google Trends pattern, supplemented by typical memoir release publicity cycles.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 9 days (Feb 17-26, 2026)

**Current Context (Feb 17):**
- We're at value 70, down from peak of 100 on Feb 15
- Memoir releases TODAY (Feb 17) - the first day of measurement window
- Pre-release publicity already drove the Feb 13-17 spike

**Historical Patterns:**
- December 2024 trial verdict created sustained spike
- Recent Feb 13-17 spike driven by CBS interview (Feb 15) and pre-release publicity
- After peaks, Pelicot typically returns to baseline (0-3) within 1-2 weeks
- The 77% base rate of "no change" (≤3 points) applies to periods WITHOUT major events

**Key Consideration:** 
The question asks about change from Feb 17 (value 70) to Feb 26. The Feb 17 value already reflects substantial pre-release publicity. The actual release day is Feb 17, meaning:
- Peak publicity likely already occurred (Feb 15 = 100)
- Feb 17 value (70) may represent declining phase
- Remaining 9 days (Feb 18-26) will show post-release trajectory

## (d) Justification

**Factors Favoring Decrease:**
1. **Peak already passed:** The Feb 15 value of 100 represents the publicity peak from CBS interview and pre-release coverage
2. **Natural decay pattern:** After major events, interest typically declines as news cycle moves on
3. **Release timing:** Book released on first day of window (Feb 17), leaving 9 days for post-release decline
4. **Historical pattern:** After December 2024 verdict spike, interest returned to baseline within weeks
5. **Starting point:** Feb 17 value (70) is already 14.6x the 90-day average, suggesting reversion to mean

**Factors Favoring Increase:**
1. **Release day effect:** Some book releases see secondary spike as reviews/purchases occur
2. **Emma Thompson audiobook:** Celebrity narrator could drive additional coverage
3. **Sustained media:** 20-30M impression estimate suggests multi-day coverage

**Factors Favoring No Change:**
1. **Offsetting forces:** Decline from peak vs. ongoing publicity could balance
2. **Base rate:** 77% of periods show ≤3 point change

**Most Likely Scenario:**
Given that we're starting at 70 (already elevated, down from 100 peak), and the major publicity driver (CBS interview, pre-release coverage) has already occurred, the most probable trajectory is continued decline over the 9-day window. The Feb 26 value will likely be significantly lower than 70, falling outside the ±3 point "no change" threshold.

Outside view calibration:

**Calibration Considerations:**

1. **Base rate adjustment:** The 77% "no change" base rate applies to typical periods. This is NOT a typical period - we're in the immediate aftermath of a major publicity spike. During volatile periods following major events, the base rate is less applicable.

2. **Peak-to-trough dynamics:** When Google Trends shows a sharp spike (Feb 15 = 100), the typical pattern is:
   - Day 1 after peak: 40-60% of peak value ✓ (Feb 16 = 54)
   - Day 2 after peak: Often rebounds slightly ✓ (Feb 17 = 70)
   - Days 3-10 after peak: Continued decline toward baseline

3. **Magnitude of current elevation:** Value of 70 is 14.6x the 90-day mean. Such extreme elevations rarely sustain for 9+ days without new triggering events.

4. **Historical precedent:** December 2024 verdict created a spike that dissipated within 2-3 weeks. We're now 9 days into the current spike (started Feb 13), suggesting natural decay is due.

5. **Probability distribution anchoring:**
   - Decrease (>3 points down): 70-80% - Most likely given post-peak positioning
   - Doesn't change (±3 points): 10-20% - Possible if publicity sustains perfectly
   - Increase (>3 points up): 5-10% - Would require unexpected new major event

6. **Upset rate consideration:** Google Trends can be volatile, but major directional trends (post-peak decline) are reliable. Upset rate for this type of prediction: ~15-20%.

**Final Calibration:**
- Strong confidence in decrease, but not extreme (not 95%+) due to:
  - Possible review-driven secondary spike
  - Emma Thompson publicity could extend interest
  - Uncertainty in exact decay rate

- Low probability of increase, but non-zero due to:
  - Possible viral social media moment
  - Unexpected news coverage
  - Celebrity endorsements

- Moderate probability of no change due to:
  - Offsetting forces (decline vs. sustained publicity)
  - ±3 point threshold provides some buffer
