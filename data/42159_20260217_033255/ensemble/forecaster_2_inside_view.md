## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE (Multiple independent reliable sources):**
- **Book launch Feb 17, 2026**: Confirmed by 15+ independent sources (CBS, NPR, Le Monde, 20minutes, Diario de Navarra, etc.). This is THE major media event at the start of the forecast window.
- **Coordinated global media blitz Feb 14-17**: BBC Newsnight (Feb 14-15), CBS "first-ever interview" (Feb 15), NPR interview (Feb 15), France 5 interviews, NYT viral podcast (2M views). Multiple high-profile outlets simultaneously.
- **International promotional tour scheduled**: London (Feb 20), Hamburg, Madrid, Barcelona (first week March), Turin (March 18). Confirmed by multiple sources.

**MODERATE EVIDENCE:**
- **Current Google Trends context**: Starting value is 70 (on Feb 17), down from peak of 100 on Feb 15. The 12-15 Feb spike aligns perfectly with the pre-launch media blitz documented above.
- **HBO documentary in production**: Confirmed by Deadline, SFR, multiple other sources. Keeps story in cultural conversation but unlikely to drive immediate Feb 17-26 search spikes.
- **Historical decay pattern**: The Dec 2024 verdict spike (100 → 21 in 9 days, -79 points) provides one data point for post-peak behavior of this exact term.

**WEAK EVIDENCE:**
- **Theatrical productions**: Scheduled but mostly outside forecast window (June Oslo, May Milan). Cultural interest indicator but not immediate search driver.
- **New relationship revelation**: Personal detail in book, human interest angle but unlikely to drive sustained search volume.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Forecast horizon**: 9 days (Feb 17 → Feb 26, 2026)

**Key temporal factors:**
- Feb 17 (Day 1): U.S./global book launch day. Starting value is 70, already down from Feb 15 peak of 100.
- Feb 17-19: Immediate post-launch period. Residual media coverage expected but major interviews already aired (Feb 14-15).
- Feb 20: London event with Kate Winslet/Kristin Scott Thomas. Could generate UK search spike but unlikely to affect U.S.-focused Google Trends significantly.
- Feb 21-26: No documented major media events. Natural decay period.

**If timeframe halved (4-5 days)**: Would increase "Doesn't change" probability because less time for decay. The 70 starting value might hold steady through Feb 21 if London event generates some buzz.

**If timeframe doubled (18 days)**: Would strongly increase "Decreases" probability. By early March, without new catalysts, historical patterns suggest significant decay from current elevated levels.

## (d) Justification

**Starting conditions (Feb 17):**
- Value is 70, already 30 points below the Feb 15 peak of 100
- The Feb 12-15 spike was driven by pre-launch media (BBC, CBS, NPR interviews)
- Feb 17 is book launch day, so some residual attention is baked into the 70 starting value

**Factors favoring DECREASE (>3 point drop to <67 by Feb 26):**
1. **Historical precedent**: The only comparable Pelicot spike (Dec 2024 verdict) dropped 79 points in 9 days. Even accounting for different circumstances, this suggests strong decay tendency.
2. **Media cycle exhaustion**: The major U.S. interviews (CBS "first-ever," NPR, BBC) already aired Feb 14-15. No comparable high-profile U.S. media scheduled for Feb 18-26.
3. **Post-peak positioning**: Starting at 70 (not 100) means we're already in decay phase. The 100→70 drop (Feb 15→17) represents -15 points/day; even if decay slows dramatically, -3 points over 9 days is minimal.
4. **Reference class behavior**: Academic literature on news-driven search spikes shows median 40-60% decay in week following peak. From 70, that implies target range of 28-42 by Feb 24.

**Factors favoring NO CHANGE (67-73 range):**
1. **Book launch timing**: Feb 17 is Day 1 of availability. Some sustained search interest as readers discover/purchase book.
2. **International events**: London (Feb 20), potential European media could create minor counter-trend.
3. **Google Trends scaling**: If no new spikes occur elsewhere, relative scaling might compress the apparent decay.
4. **150,000 print run + 22 languages**: Broad distribution could sustain baseline interest.

**Factors favoring INCREASE (>73 by Feb 26):**
1. **Unexpected controversy**: Book revelations could generate second-wave coverage (low probability, major outlets already interviewed her).
2. **London event amplification**: Feb 20 event with A-list actresses could generate viral moment (possible but U.S. Google Trends less sensitive to UK events).
3. **HBO documentary news**: If release date announced during window (speculative).

**Shift from outside view:**
Outside view: Decrease 45%, No change 41%, Increase 14%

The outside view appropriately weighted post-spike decay patterns. Current evidence STRENGTHENS the decrease case because:
- We have specific confirmation that the major media events (CBS, NPR, BBC) already occurred Feb 14-15
- No comparable U.S. media events are documented for Feb 18-26
- The starting value (70) is already post-peak, not at peak

However, the outside view may have UNDERWEIGHTED the "no change" scenario because:
- Feb 17 is the actual launch day (not post-launch), so some sustained interest is reasonable
- The 150,000 print run and 22-language release represents broader sustained interest than a pure news spike
- Google Trends scaling effects could compress apparent changes

**Calibration adjustment:**
Shift ~5-7 percentage points from "Decrease" to "No change" to account for launch-day dynamics and scaling effects. Slight reduction in "Increase" because no new major U.S. media events identified.

## Probability Calibration

**Base rates (outside view):** Decrease 45%, No change 41%, Increase 14%

**Inside view adjustments:**

**DECREASE (target: ~40-42%):**
- Strong evidence of post-peak decay pattern
- Major media already aired (Feb 14-15)
- Historical precedent supports significant drops
- But: Feb 17 is launch day, not post-launch, so some floor exists
- Adjustment: -3 to -5 points to account for launch-day support

**NO CHANGE (target: ~45-48%):**
- Launch day timing provides some sustained interest
- International events (Feb 20 London) could offset decay
- Google Trends scaling could compress changes
- 150,000 print run suggests broad sustained interest
- Adjustment: +5 to +7 points from decreased decrease probability

**INCREASE (target: ~10-12%):**
- Requires unexpected second wave (controversy, viral moment, HBO news)
- London event (Feb 20) is possible catalyst but U.S. Trends less sensitive
- No documented major U.S. media Feb 18-26
- Adjustment: -2 to -4 points, lowering from 14% baseline

**Final calibration:**
- Decrease: 40%
- No change: 48%
- Increase: 12%

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Google Trends value for "gisele pelicot" on Feb 26 be >3 higher, <3 lower, or within ±3 of Feb 17 value (70)?

2. **Base rate**: Outside view: Decrease 45%, No change 41%, Increase 14%. Final prediction maintains this general ordering with modest adjustments for launch-day dynamics.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = No change (48%); Least likely = Increase (12%). Makes sense: we're post-peak but on launch day, so modest decay or stability most probable; major increase requires unexpected catalyst.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Feb 17 is global book launch day (15+ sources confirm)
   - Major U.S. media (CBS, NPR, BBC) already aired Feb 14-15
   - Current value 70, down from Feb 15 peak of 100
   - No major U.S. media events documented Feb 18-26
   - Historical Pelicot spike (Dec 2024) dropped 79 points in 9 days

5. **Blind spot**: London event Feb 20 with Kate Winslet/Kristin Scott Thomas generates unexpected viral moment that drives U.S. search interest. Would shift ~10-15 points from "Decrease" to "Increase."

6. **Status quo**: Current trajectory is decay (100→70 in 2 days). However, Feb 17 being launch day creates temporary floor. Modest nudge toward "No change" already incorporated.

7. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs, all between 0-100.

Probabilities: [12, 48, 40]
