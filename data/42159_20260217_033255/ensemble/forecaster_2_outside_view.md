Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis:**

**Amazon listing (Dec 2024):** Marketing copy for a biography; contains no verifiable facts about Gisèle Pelicot herself. Low informational value.

**TIME article (Feb 20, 2025):** High-quality journalism from a reputable source. Provides comprehensive factual background on the rape trial, conviction statistics, and legal context. Named expert opinions from Pelicot's lawyer Antoine Camus and attorney Anne Bouillon. Published 11 months before the forecast window.

**The Guardian (Mar 20, 2025):** Reputable source announcing memoir publication. Key fact: "A Hymn to Life" scheduled for January 27, 2026 release in 20+ languages. Published 11 months before forecast window.

**BBC (Dec 15, 2024):** Detailed factual account of the case timeline and trial. High-quality journalism with named police sources. Published 14 months before forecast window.

**The New Yorker (Feb 15, 2026):** Published 2 days before forecast window begins. High-quality long-form journalism providing family perspective. Confirms memoir title "A Hymn to Life." This is the most temporally relevant source.

**CBS News (Dec 19, 2024):** Factual coverage of trial verdict and sentencing. Includes Pelicot's direct quotes about her determination to change society. Published 14 months before forecast window.

**Agent Report:** Identifies key event: memoir release on February 17, 2026 (first day of forecast window) with Emma Thompson narrating audiobook. Estimates 20-30 million impression reach in U.S. Cites pre-launch coverage including CBS Sunday Morning (Feb 15) and NPR. This is highly relevant and time-specific.

**Google Trends Data:** Shows current value of 70 on Feb 17, 2026. Recent spike from near-zero (avg 1.6 in prior week) to 51.7 in last 7 days. Peak of 100 on Feb 15. Base rate analysis shows 77% of 9-day windows have ≤3 point changes, 16% increase >3, 7% decrease >3.

(b) **Reference Class Analysis:**

**Reference Class 1: Book release publicity cycles for high-profile memoirs**
- Typical pattern: Peak interest on/around release date, gradual decline over following days
- Suitability: HIGH - directly applicable since memoir releases Feb 17

**Reference Class 2: Celebrity/public figure Google Trends patterns during major media events**
- Pattern: Spike during event, rapid decay afterward
- Suitability: MODERATE - Pelicot is not a traditional celebrity but has become a public figure

**Reference Class 3: Historical 9-day Google Trends windows for this specific term**
- Base rate: 77% no change (≤3 points), 16% increase, 7% decrease
- Suitability: HIGH - most directly relevant, though current context is unprecedented (major book release)

**Most suitable:** Combination of Reference Classes 1 and 3, weighted toward the unprecedented publicity event.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction window:** 9 days (Feb 17-26, 2026)
**Current status (Feb 17):** Value is 70, following a dramatic spike from ~2 (Feb 11) to 100 (Feb 15)

**Key temporal factors:**
- Feb 17 is the FIRST DAY of the window AND the memoir release date
- Pre-release publicity already drove value from 0-2 range to 100 peak (Feb 15)
- Current value (70) represents a 30-point drop from peak but still 35x higher than baseline
- CBS interview aired Feb 15, NPR coverage same period
- Audiobook with Emma Thompson launches Feb 17

**Historical pattern for this term:**
- Baseline: ~0-3 for most of 90-day period
- Recent spike: Feb 11 (5) → Feb 15 (100) → Feb 16 (54) → Feb 17 (70)
- The spike correlates with pre-release media coverage

**Typical book release patterns:**
- Maximum interest at/near release date
- Reviews and coverage continue for 3-7 days post-release
- Gradual decline as news cycle moves on

(d) **Justification:**

The outside view must reconcile two competing dynamics:

**Factors suggesting DECREASE:**
1. The peak (100) occurred Feb 15, two days BEFORE the forecast window begins
2. Value already dropped from 100 → 54 → 70, showing volatility but general downward pressure
3. Typical publicity cycles peak at release announcement/pre-release, not post-release
4. Base rate: only 16% of 9-day windows show >3 point increases
5. Starting value (70) is already 14x higher than 90-day mean (4.8), suggesting mean reversion pressure

**Factors suggesting INCREASE or STABILITY:**
1. Feb 17 is the actual release date - physical/digital availability may drive searches
2. Emma Thompson audiobook launch on Feb 17 adds publicity
3. Reviews and media coverage typically roll out in days following release
4. Agent report estimates 20-30M impressions over first week
5. The 70 value on Feb 17 could represent early-day measurement before full release impact

**Critical insight:** The Google Trends value of 70 on Feb 17 is measured at the START of that day. The memoir releases that same day. Therefore, the Feb 17 baseline may not yet reflect the full impact of the release event itself.

**Most likely scenario:** Interest remains elevated through Feb 18-20 as reviews publish and audiobook gains traction, then gradually declines toward Feb 26. The question is whether the Feb 26 value will be >73 (increase), 67-73 (no change), or <67 (decrease).

Given that:
- The pre-release peak has passed
- Media cycles typically last 3-5 days post-release
- Feb 26 is 9 days after release
- Mean reversion pressure is strong (current value 14x baseline)

The most probable outcome is a DECREASE below 67 by Feb 26.

Outside view calibration:

**Calibration considerations:**

1. **Established distribution:** The base rate (77% no change, 16% increase, 7% decrease) was calculated during periods of LOW baseline interest (mean 4.8). The current elevated state (70) makes these percentages less applicable - volatility increases at higher values.

2. **Domain upset rate:** Google Trends for news-driven topics show high volatility around events but strong mean reversion. Upsets would be sustained elevated interest beyond typical news cycles. Historical rate: ~20-30% of major news spikes maintain elevated levels beyond 7-10 days.

3. **Probability tethering:** 
   - The 100 peak on Feb 15 represents maximum recent interest
   - Current value 70 is 70% of peak
   - By Feb 26 (9 days post-release), typical decay suggests 30-50% of peak
   - This implies value of 30-50, which is >3 points below 67 (threshold for "decrease")

4. **Confidence adjustment:** 
   - High confidence in DECREASE: The combination of pre-release peak, 9-day timeframe, and typical media cycles strongly suggests decline
   - Moderate probability for NO CHANGE: Possible if sustained media coverage or unexpected news maintains interest
   - Low probability for INCREASE: Would require new major news event or viral moment

**Final calibration:**
- Decrease: 70% (strong mean reversion pressure, typical post-peak decay)
- Doesn't change: 25% (sustained coverage or plateau scenario)
- Increases: 5% (requires unexpected new catalyst)

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 5
Doesn't change: 25
Decreases: 70
