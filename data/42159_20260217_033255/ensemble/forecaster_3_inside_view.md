Analysis:

1) Resolution/criteria paraphrase (≤30 words)
Between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-26 (US Google Trends, fixed 2026-01-27–2026-02-26), resolve “Increase” if Feb 26 > Feb 17 +3; “Decrease” if < Feb 17 −3; else “Doesn’t change”.

2) Outside view base rate (given)
Increases 5 / Doesn’t change 25 / Decreases 70.

(a) Source analysis (brief; quality + date)
- Le Monde/AFP (2025-03-21): Reputable; announces memoir planned for 2026; background on trial and convictions. Mostly factual.
- Fib.no program page (2026 season info): Primary source for theater programming; reliable for dates/venues, less predictive for US searches.
- Piccolo Teatro (dated 2026-05-24, future relative to today): Primary source but outside forecast window; not relevant to Feb 17–26 US search behavior.
- Globe and Mail (2026-02-13): Reputable; memoir timing and profile; factual reporting + narrative framing.
- NPR (2026-02-15): Reputable; signals US mainstream exposure (podcast/interview). Good for mechanism of US search spikes.
- CBS News (2026-02-15): Reputable; states Feb 17 publication and frames it as first major interview; strong US visibility driver.
- AskNews: Excélsior / Diario de Navarra / La Libre / 20minutes / La Nouvelle République / Madame Figaro / Franceinfo / Radio France / SCMP / VG / etc. Mixed but mostly mainstream outlets; collectively strong on one key fact: major synchronized memoir release Feb 17 + intensive media tour. Non‑US outlets are less directly relevant to US Google Trends level, but still indicate global newsworthiness.
- Deadline (2026-01-05) + SFR (2026-01-10): Reputable entertainment trade (Deadline) confirms HBO documentary in development; could support longer tail of attention, but no evidence of a specific Feb 26 catalyst.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution criteria)
Strong evidence
- Concentrated media “spike” drivers are clustered around Feb 14–17 (BBC/CBS/NPR + release day), implying post-event decay by Feb 26 is the default pattern for news-driven searches.
- Direct mechanism: book release + flagship US coverage (CBS, NPR) predict near-term peak/near-peak attention around release, then mean reversion.

Moderate evidence
- Ongoing “media tour” narrative (Franceinfo/Radio France and multiple outlets) suggests attention may stay elevated for several days, potentially reducing the magnitude of decline (or causing secondary bumps). However, the question resolves on Feb 26 specifically (9 days later), when tours typically have diminished marginal impact unless a new marquee US event occurs.
- HBO documentary announcement supports a longer-run baseline above zero, but absent a release date/major trailer during Feb 17–26, it’s more “background uplift” than a Feb 26 spike driver.

Weak evidence
- Theater productions and non-US appearances (or March events) are mostly outside-window or not US-salient enough to govern Feb 26 vs Feb 17.

Net: Evidence tilts toward “Decrease” being more likely than the outside-view baseline, and “Doesn’t change” being less likely because the ±3 band is narrow during volatile post-spike periods.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Window length: 9 days (from today, 2026-02-17, to 2026-02-26).
- If halved (~4–5 days): “Doesn’t change” becomes more plausible (still near the media crest).
- If doubled (~18 days): “Decrease” becomes even more likely as attention continues decaying after the release cycle.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment vs outside view)
Status quo if nothing new happens: interest decays after the release-week burst. The outside view already leaned “Decrease” (70%). The inside view adds: (1) multiple high-reach US media hits immediately pre-window (CBS/NPR Feb 15) plus the release on Feb 17, which tends to concentrate search interest early; (2) no specific identified US-centric event near Feb 26 that would re-accelerate searches; (3) the strict ±3 “no change” band is hard to hit when coming off a spike. Together, these push modest probability mass from “Doesn’t change” into “Decreases,” while allowing a small bump to “Increases” only for a plausible late-window surprise (e.g., viral clip, controversy, or a major US show segment landing Feb 25–26).

Probability calibration
- “Decreases” remains the modal outcome: most plausible Feb 26 < Feb 17 by >3 due to post-release mean reversion.
- “Doesn’t change” is less likely than the outside view because (i) narrow band, (ii) volatility around a publicity spike.
- “Increases” is still lowest, but not zero: could happen if Feb 17 value is measured before full-day release impact or if a late, high-profile US event lands near Feb 26.

Checklist:
1. Options/criteria: Feb 26 vs Feb 17 on fixed-range Trends; ±3 band = “Doesn’t change”; else increase/decrease.  
2. Outside view anchored: [5,25,70].  
3. Consistency: Most likely=Decreases; least likely=Increases; aligned with post-spike decay logic.  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):
   - CBS + NPR US coverage immediately pre-window; release-day attention clusters early then fades.
   - Feb 17 is release day; Feb 26 is 9 days later with no identified late catalyst.
   - HBO doc announced, but no sign of a Feb 26-specific trigger.
5. Blind spot: A major viral/US TV moment or controversy on/near Feb 26 could flip to “Increase.”  
6. Status quo: news cycle fades; nudges toward “Decrease.”  
7. Technicalities: probabilities 0–100, sum to 100.

Probabilities: [8, 17, 75]
