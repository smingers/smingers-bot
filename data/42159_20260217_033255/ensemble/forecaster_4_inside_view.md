Analysis
========
1. Paraphrase of options & rule (≤30 words)  
Google Trends US value on 26 Feb 2026 will be compared with 17 Feb 2026 (fixed-range URL).  
• >+3 → “Increases”  
• −3…+3 → “Doesn’t change”  
• <−3 → “Decreases”.

2. Outside-view base rate (last 90 days, all 9-day windows)  
Increase 16 | No change 77 | Decrease 7.

3. Consistency check  
Most likely = Decrease, Least likely = Increase – consistent with post-spike mean-reversion logic.

4. Key evidence (≤20 words each)  
a) Book released 17 Feb; huge press burst 12-17 Feb – current spike already visible.  
b) Typical Google Trends spikes for memoir/TV interview decay >50 % within a week.  
c) Follow-up events (London reading 20 Feb, interviews) moderate but smaller audience than launch day.  
d) Nine-day ±3 threshold is tight; even modest decay from elevated 17 Feb level will breach −3.  
e) No scheduled fresh catalyst ≥24-25 Feb; HBO doc later in 2026.

5. Blind-spot scenario  
Unforeseen viral clip (e.g., celebrity endorsement or controversy) on 24–25 Feb pushes search interest above 17 Feb value.

6. Status-quo outcome  
Without additional triggers, Google Trends numbers normally regress toward pre-spike baseline, favouring “Decrease”.

7. Technicalities  
Probabilities sum to 100; each between 0–100.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
A) Source analysis (quality, date, facts vs opinion)
• NPR, CBS, BBC, Globe & Mail, France-Info, etc. (Feb 12-16 2026) – high-quality, independent outlets reporting Pelicot interviews and memoir launch; factual timings, some laudatory opinion.  
• Multiple continental newspapers (Le Monde, 20Minutes, Diario de Navarra, Excélsior) 16 Feb – confirm global 17 Feb release, print run, tour dates; factual.  
• Theatre/festival sites (Fib.no, Piccolo Teatro) – older (2025-26) background; quality OK, less relevant short-term.  
• HBO/Deadline Jan 2026 – reliable trade press; doc premiere “early 2026” but not dated; opinion minimal.  
All sources align on memoir launch 17 Feb and heavy media exposure 12-17 Feb; no fresh event announced 24-26 Feb.

B) Evidence weighting
Strong  
• Historical Google Trends pattern: named-person publicity spikes decay rapidly (direct causal mechanism, widely replicated).  
• Multiple independent outlets confirm launch date exactly at window start – ensures 17 Feb is in spike zone.

Moderate  
• London reading 20 Feb may lift searches slightly (single event, narrower UK focus).  
• Continuing interviews (NY Times, Vogue) sustain interest but usually below launch-day peak.

Weak  
• HBO documentary sometime “early 2026” – date vague, unlikely inside 17–26 Feb.  
• Social-media virality hard to predict.

C) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon = 9 days.  
If horizon halved (4-5 days), probability of “No change” would rise (decay not yet large).  
If doubled (18 days), “Decrease” probability would rise further as interest cools.

D) Justification of inside-view shift  
Current value sits in an exceptional spike. Reference-class windows that start at such heights usually show ≥20-point drop inside 9 days. That makes outside-view base (7 % Decrease) non-analogous. I transfer ~35 % probability mass from “No change” to “Decrease”, leave small surplus with “Increase” for tail-risk of new viral moment.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Probability calibration
After weighting evidence:

• Increases – still possible via viral clip or renewed scandal, but post-peak upside rarer.  
• Doesn’t change – needs 17 Feb value to hold within ±3 despite likely decay; plausible if scale readjusts downward for whole window.  
• Decreases – regression-to-mean plus lack of new catalyst make this the modal outcome.
