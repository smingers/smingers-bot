Analysis
--------------------------------------------------
1. Paraphrase of options and criteria (≤30 words)  
Compare Google-Trends value for “gisele pelicot” on 26 Feb 2026 with the value on 17 Feb 2026.  
>3 higher = “Increases”; within ±3 = “Doesn’t change”; >3 lower = “Decreases”.

2. Outside-view base-rate (past 90 days, sliding 9-day windows)  
Increases 17  |  Doesn’t change 75  |  Decreases 8

3. Source & evidence weighting  
Strong evidence  
• Simultaneous global launch of Pelicot’s memoir on 17 Feb  — confirmed by Penguin Press, Flammarion, CBS, NPR, BBC, AFP (multiple independent outlets, identical date).  
Moderate evidence  
• Follow-on media tour (London event 20 Feb; Hamburg event sells 1 000 tickets in 48 h; interviews scheduled with NY-Times, FAZ, Vogue, etc.).  
• Typical search-interest decay curves for book/TV interviews: steep fall-off with 2–5-day half-life (academic studies on “news spikes”).  
Weak evidence  
• HBO documentary announcement for “early 2026” – outside 9-day window.

4. Key factors shifting the base rate  
a) 17 Feb is the *apex* of publicity (book drops, first-ever US/UK interviews already aired 15-17 Feb).  
b) Search interest spiked to 100 on 15 Feb; already slid to 58 on 16 Feb (objective Google-Trends reading).  
c) No new event of equal or greater magnitude scheduled after 20 Feb; most post-launch coverage will be reviews, causing normal decay.  
d) Nine-day horizon is short; decay by ≥4 index points is common when starting from an elevated value.  
e) Outside-view shows only 7 % historical chance of a >3-point drop, but that reference set contained *ordinary* periods, not post-spike reversion.  We therefore regard it as non-analogous and up-weight “Decreases”.

5. Time-frame sensitivity  
Halving window to 4–5 days would *increase* “Decreases” further (faster decay).  
Doubling to 18 days would give time for a second publicity wave (e.g., March Italian tour), nudging probability back toward “Doesn’t change”.

6. Scenario consistency check  
Most likely = Decreases; least likely = Increases – coherent with evidence of a passing peak.

7. Blind-spot  
A viral clip, unforeseen scandal or award on 24-25 Feb could lift searches, flipping outcome to “Increases”.

8. Status-quo tug  
Even with heavy shrinkage toward the outside view, central tendency in a nine-day window after a spike is downward rather than flat; I therefore allow 35 % for “Doesn’t change” (vs 75 % base).

9. Top 5 evidence items (≤20 words each)  
• 17 Feb global memoir release – biggest planned media moment.  
• Google-Trends already down 42 pts (100→58) between 15-16 Feb.  
• No equally large news hooks scheduled after 20 Feb.  
• Historical decay half-life for book spikes ≈3 days.  
• Multiple outlets confirm concentrated publicity 13-20 Feb only.

Probability calibration
Starting 17/75/8, apply +42 pp to “Decreases”, −40 pp to “Doesn’t change”, −2 pp to “Increases”, then renormalise.
