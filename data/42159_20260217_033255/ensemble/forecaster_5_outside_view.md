Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. GoogleTrendsData (dated 17 Feb 2026).  Primary, quantitative.  Gives daily U-S trend values for “gisele pelicot” and an automated 90-day statistical summary.  No opinions.  High reliability for the purpose of establishing base rates, noting the usual Google Trends caveats about relative scaling.  
2. Agent report (compiled 17 Feb 2026).  Secondary.  Collates press-release information about Pelicot’s forthcoming memoir and likely publicity.  Contains some inference (“easily large enough to push Google Trends values several index points”) which is an opinion, not a measured fact.  Useful later for an inside view, but not for the pure outside view requested here.  
3–8. News features from TIME, Guardian, BBC, CBS, New Yorker, Amazon listing.  All dated 2024-26.  They supply biographical context and demonstrate that Pelicot has been news-worthy, but they offer no hard data about day-to-day Google-search behaviour.  They therefore have almost no bearing on the statistical outside view of a nine-day change in Google Trends.  Opinions are embedded (e.g., legal experts, lawyers), but again not relevant to the statistical baseline.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Potential reference classes:  
1. All 9-day windows for the term “gisele pelicot” in the last 90 days (directly provided).  
2. 9-day windows for dozens of similarly sized, single-person French news figures (data not compiled here).  
3. Generic Google Trends behaviour for non-household names that occasionally spike because of a single news event (academic papers place the “return-to-baseline” half-life for such spikes at ≈3–7 days).

Class 1 is the narrowest and uses exactly the target term, so sampling error is larger but external‐validity questions disappear.  Because the question is about this specific term and the 9-day horizon, class 1 is the most defensible starting point for an outside view.  I therefore adopt it.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Forecast window: 17 Feb 2026 → 26 Feb 2026 (nine calendar days inclusive).  
Historical pattern from class 1 (90-day look-back, sliding 9-day windows):  
• 77 % of windows end within ±3 index points → “Doesn’t change”  
• 16 % end > +3 points → “Increases”  
• 7 %  end < –3 points → “Decreases”  

(d) Justification  
The outside view deliberately ignores any qualitative “inside” knowledge (e.g., the memoir launch, media coverage).  It rests solely on the empirical base rate: over the past three months the Google Trends number for “gisele pelicot” almost always drifts less than four points in a nine-day span.  In other words, the default expectation is stability, not movement.  Even though there was one enormous spike on 15 Feb 2026, the great majority of earlier windows still finished in the ±3-point band.  Consequently, the statistically sound outside forecast is that “Doesn’t change” is the most likely outcome, with “Increases” roughly twice as probable as “Decreases,” mirroring the 16 % vs 7 % historical frequencies.

Outside view calibration:

• Historical distribution (77/16/7) is our anchor.  
• No obvious systemic bias in the sampling method (same source, same metric).  
• Unexpected outcomes (“upsets”) were rare: only 23 % of windows deviated beyond ±3.  
• Conservatively, a small shrinkage toward an uninformative 33/33/33 prior would widen the uncertainty slightly, but given 90 days ≈ 81 overlapping windows, the empirical frequencies are already fairly robust.  
Therefore I apply only mild shrinkage: move the largest bin down a couple of points and redistribute proportionally.

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 17%  
Doesn't change: 75%  
Decreases: 8%
