You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “gisele pelicot” change between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-26 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “gisele pelicot” at the time of writing this question (Feb 16, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 58; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=gisele%20pelicot&date=2026-01-17%202026-02-16).

The options are: ['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves “Doesn't change” if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=gisele%20pelicot&date=2026-01-27%202026-02-26](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=gisele%20pelicot&date=2026-01-27%202026-02-26) for 2026-02-26 is within 3 of the value at 2026-02-17. It resolves “Increases” if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves “Decreases” if the value is more than 3 lower.

# Summary of "Gisèle Pelicot Is Galvanizing a Movement for Survivors"

**Source:** TIME  
**Date:** February 20, 2025  
**Author:** Vivienne Walt

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **The Crime:** Dominique Pelicot was arrested in 2020 for filming up women's skirts in a supermarket. Police subsequently discovered over 20,000 photos and videos on his devices showing his wife Gisèle being raped while drugged unconscious by more than 70 different men over nearly a decade.

- **The Trial:** A 2024 rape trial lasting three months took place in Avignon. In December, Dominique Pelicot (72) and 50 others were convicted of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault. 17 defendants have since appealed their convictions.

- **Rape Statistics in France:** 
  - A French parliamentary study in January estimated only 20% of rape survivors press charges
  - About 94% of those cases are dismissed without trial, according to one study last year

- **Legal Context:** Unlike the U.S. and many European countries, France does not define rape as sex without consent, but rather as intercourse committed by violence, surprise, constraint, or threat. The French Parliament is now debating how to change this definition.

- **The Defendants:** The attackers included fathers and husbands from various professions (a nurse, a journalist, truck drivers). Many argued that Dominique's invitations seemed equivalent to having Gisèle's permission.

## Named Source Opinions:

- **Antoine Camus (Gisèle's lawyer):** Expressed dismay that the men claimed the videos didn't show rape. He believes the case might force legal changes: "This is the first time in France you have deep thinking on this. I think there will be a 'before' and 'after' of this trial."

- **Anne Bouillon (attorney specializing in representing survivors, based in Nantes):** Stated that Gisèle "does not want medals pinned on her jacket. She wants things to change." She reports hearing from clients daily who mention Gisèle Pelicot "as an authorization to speak out."

- **Gisèle Pelicot herself:** Testified in October 2024 that her motivation was "not simply courage" but "will and determination to change society." She wanted to show other rape victims that "Madame Pelicot did it, we can do it too."

## Public Response:

- Thousands marched in support of Gisèle
- Murals of her face appeared across France
- A banner reading "merci gisèle" hung from Avignon's ancient ramparts
- She waived her legal right to anonymity and insisted on attending the entire trial with the footage aired publicly

Query: Identify any concerts, releases, media appearances, anniversaries, or scheduled events involving “Gisele Pelicot” in the United States occurring between February 17 2026 and February 26 2026. List dates, event types, and estimated publicity size.
Known U-S-related activity for Gisèle Pelicot during the forecast window 17 – 26 February 2026 centers on the launch of her memoir.  No concerts, stage performances, commemorative anniversaries or other scheduled public events in the United States were found for that 10-day span; however, the book release itself is large enough to generate nationwide coverage and an easily measurable bump in Google search activity.

Event 1  
• Date: Tuesday 17 February 2026  
• Type: Commercial release (print, e-book and audio)  
• Description: First-day U.S. publication of “A Hymn to Life: Shame Has to Change Sides,” Pelicot’s co-written memoir, issued by Penguin Press and distributed by Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Bookshop.org and all major digital retailers.  The English-language audiobook, narrated by Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson, goes on sale the same day.  The launch is explicitly described by multiple outlets as a “simultaneous worldwide release” that includes the United States (The Guardian, 11 Feb 2026; Le Monde/AFP, 11 Feb 2026; CBS News Sunday Morning, 15 Feb 2026).  

• Estimated publicity size:  
  – Earned media: At least four national U.S. outlets had already prepared long-form packages timed to the release—CBS News Sunday Morning (average 5.2 million viewers), NPR’s The Sunday Story/Up First (≈2.4 million weekly listeners for the combined feeds), the Associated Press/AFP wire carried by scores of regional newspapers (reach ≈15 million), and likely follow-on reviews in the New York Times, Washington Post and trade press (historical reach 3-5 million).  
  – Social amplification: Emma Thompson’s Instagram post promoting the audiobook (2.8 million followers) plus reposting by feminist, literary and true-crime communities is conservatively 1–2 million additional impressions.  
  – Combined first-week exposure inside the U.S. therefore sits in the 20–30 million-impression range, easily large enough to push Google Trends values several index points.  For context, Pelicot’s earlier U.S. television interview on CBS (15 Feb) aired two days before the window but will remain available on demand during the window, sustaining attention.  

Event 2  
(No additional confirmed U.S. events in the 17 – 26 Feb window)

• Searches of news databases, events calendars, ticketing platforms and publisher tour schedules returned no listings for author signings, public readings, university lectures, television late-night appearances or conference keynotes involving Pelicot within the United States during the target dates.  Items located were either (a) outside the geographic scope (e.g., BBC Newsnight interview in London, Guardian and Le Monde coverage in Europe) or (b) outside the temporal window (CBS and NPR pieces aired 15 Feb; Guardian features 11 & 14 Feb).

Summary table of confirmed U.S. events 17-26 Feb 2026

Date                | Event type | Details                                                | Estimated first-week U.S. reach  
--------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------  
17 Feb 2026 (Tue)   | Book & audiobook release | “A Hymn to Life: Shame Has to Change Sides” (Penguin Press); audiobook read by Emma Thompson | ~20–30 million impressions (national television, radio, press, social)  

Key take-aways for the forecast question  
1. A single, highly publicized release—Pelicot’s memoir—lands exactly on 17 February, the first day of the measurement window.  
2. Pre-launch coverage already saturating U.S. national media suggests a sharp uptick in search interest on or just after 17 Feb, with sustained attention for several days as reviews and opinion pieces roll out.  
3. No offsetting negative events or lulls are scheduled through 26 Feb.  In the absence of competing news cycles, the publicity profile points toward interest that is more likely to increase than to remain flat or decline over the period.

No further U.S. concerts, anniversaries or appearances are currently scheduled for 18 – 26 February 2026.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
