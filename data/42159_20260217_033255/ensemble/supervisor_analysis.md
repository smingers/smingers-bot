Disagreement Analysis:

1. **Probability of "Doesn't change" vs "Decreases"**: The most significant disagreement is between forecaster_2 (48% no change, 40% decrease) and forecaster_3 (17% no change, 75% decrease). Forecaster_2 believes the book launch day on Feb 17 creates a temporary floor and that the ±3 band is achievable given potential sustained interest from ongoing media coverage. Forecaster_3 believes post-spike decay is strong and the narrow ±3 band makes "no change" very hard to hit. Forecasters 1, 4, and 5 fall in between but lean toward decrease. This disagreement accounts for ~30 percentage points of spread on the two most likely outcomes.

2. **Impact of the Feb 20 London event**: Forecasters disagree on whether the London reading event (with Kate Winslet and Kristin Scott Thomas) will meaningfully sustain or boost U.S. Google search interest. Forecaster_2 and forecaster_4 give it moderate weight as a potential interest-sustainer, while forecasters 1, 3, and 5 largely dismiss it as UK-focused with limited U.S. search impact. This affects the balance between "Doesn't change" and "Decreases" by roughly 5-10 percentage points.

3. **Current Feb 17 value and decay trajectory**: There's a factual discrepancy about the starting value. Forecasters 1, 2, and 4 reference a Feb 17 value of ~70, while the question states the Feb 16 value is 58. Forecaster 5 explicitly notes the drop from 100 to 58 between Feb 15-16. If the Feb 17 value is actually closer to 58 (or lower) rather than 70, the decay may already be further along, which affects how much further decline is expected and whether the ±3 band is more or less likely to be hit.

Root Causes:

1. **"Doesn't change" vs "Decreases" split**: Primarily different weighting of the same evidence (post-spike decay patterns vs. launch-day sustained interest) combined with different base rate assumptions about how quickly book-related search spikes decay.

2. **Feb 20 London event impact**: Mix of different factual beliefs (how much UK celebrity events drive U.S. searches) and different weighting of the same evidence. Partially resolvable by checking whether past UK-based celebrity events for this topic drove U.S. search spikes.

3. **Current Feb 17 value**: This is a verifiable factual disagreement. The actual Feb 17 Google Trends value determines the starting point for measuring the ±3 change threshold.
