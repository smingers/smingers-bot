Resolution of Disagreements:

1. **Current Feb 17 value**: The research could not definitively resolve the exact Feb 17 Google Trends value. The question states Feb 16 value is 58, and some forecasters used ~70 for Feb 17. The agent report confirms the last known value is 58 for Feb 16, with the Feb 17 value unknown. However, since Feb 17 is the book's global release date, it's plausible the value could be elevated on that day. The key point is that the peak was 100 on Feb 15 (CBS interview day), and by Feb 16 it had already dropped to 58 — a massive 42-point decline in one day. This supports the view that decay is rapid and already well underway.

2. **Feb 20 London event impact on US searches**: The research found no evidence that the London event would drive significant US search interest. The agent report explicitly states: "No confirmed U.S. media bookings, live appearances or promotional events are scheduled for Pelicot between 18 and 26 Feb 2026." The London event is UK-focused. This supports forecasters 1, 3, and 5 who dismissed its US impact.

3. **Scheduled US events Feb 18-26**: The research clearly confirms there are NO US media appearances or events scheduled for this window. The CBS Sunday Morning interview aired Feb 15, the book releases Feb 17, and all subsequent events are outside the US (Hamburg on Feb 24, London on Feb 20). This is a strong signal supporting "Decreases" — the major publicity push is concentrated before and at the start of the window, with nothing to sustain interest afterward.

4. **HBO documentary**: Confirmed to be "in production" with no specific date, so it cannot serve as a catalyst during this window.

Updated Analysis:

The evidence strongly supports the "Decreases" camp. Key factors:

- The peak was Feb 15 (100), already down to 58 by Feb 16 — a 42-point drop in one day
- Feb 17 is book release day, which may provide a temporary bump, but the major US media coverage (CBS, NPR, BBC) already aired Feb 14-15
- There are NO confirmed US media events or appearances between Feb 18-26
- The London event (Feb 20) and Hamburg event (Feb 24) are outside the US and unlikely to drive significant US search traffic
- HBO documentary has no scheduled date
- Historical pattern: post-spike decay for named-person searches is rapid

The ±3 "doesn't change" band is narrow. Starting from whatever the Feb 17 value is (likely somewhere between 50-70 given the rapid decay from 100), a 9-day period with no new US catalysts makes further decline very likely. Even if Feb 17 gets a small release-day bump, by Feb 26 interest should have decayed well below the Feb 17 level.

I'm adjusting slightly toward "Decreases" from the weighted average, given the clear confirmation of no US events in the window. The "Doesn't change" probability should be somewhat lower than 30%, and "Decreases" somewhat higher than 57%. "Increases" remains low but non-zero for unexpected viral moments.

Confidence: MEDIUM

Probabilities: [10, 25, 65]
