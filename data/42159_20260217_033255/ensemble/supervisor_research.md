3. **Chen Yan (AI Industry Analyst at Quest Mobile):**

**Date:** February 15, 2026

Query: What is the current Google Trends interest value for "gisele pelicot" in the US on February 17, 2026, and what major US media appearances or events are scheduled for Gisele Pelicot between February 18-26, 2026? Also check if there are any upcoming HBO documentary announcements with specific dates.
1. Google Trends interest value on 17 Feb 2026 (U.S.)
   • None of the news or web items located gives the numeric Google Trends “interest-over-time” figure for the single day 17 Feb 2026.  
   • The only published data point remains the value of 58 for 16 Feb 2026, taken from a 30-day window ending 16 Feb 2026 (background of the forecasting question).  
   • Therefore the exact U.S. value for 17 Feb 2026 still has to be read directly from Google Trends by opening the fixed-range link https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=gisele%20pelicot&date=2026-01-27%202026-02-26 and hovering over the 17 Feb data point. No secondary source captures the number.

2. U.S. media appearances or events scheduled 18 – 26 Feb 2026
   Searches of general news (CBS, NBC, CNN, NYT, Vogue, Deadline), publisher announcements and cultural listings produced no evidence of any U.S.-based television, radio, podcast, bookstore, lecture-series or festival appearances for Gisele Pelicot during the target window 18–26 Feb.  
   a) The CBS Sunday Morning U.S. TV interview aired 15 Feb 2026 (CBS News, 12 Feb 2026; CBS News, 15 Feb 2026) — outside the window.  
   b) Publication day for the U.S. edition of her memoir “A Hymn to Life” is 17 Feb 2026 (Le Monde with AFP, 11 Feb 2026), also just before the window.  
   c) All other dated public engagements located — e.g., Elbphilharmonie conversation in Hamburg on 24 Feb 2026 (Elbphilharmonie.de, 24 Feb 2026) — occur outside the United States.  
   • Conclusion: as of the latest coverage up to 17 Feb 2026, no confirmed U.S. media bookings, live appearances or promotional events are scheduled for Pelicot between 18 and 26 Feb 2026.

3. HBO documentary announcements
   • HBO confirmed it is “currently in production” on an untitled Gisele Pelicot documentary (Deadline, 5 Jan 2026; WebWire press release, undated).  
   • Neither announcement supplies a premiere date, premiere month, season, festival slot nor year of first broadcast.  
   • No later statement modifying this status was found.  
   • Thus, there is an HBO project but it lacks any specific scheduled date and cannot be treated as a timed event.

Key findings relevant to the forecasting question
• Google Trends number for 17 Feb 2026 remains unknown pending direct inspection; the last known adjacent value is 58 for 16 Feb.
• There are no U.S. events or fresh media exposure scheduled for 18 – 26 Feb 2026 that could reasonably be expected to drive a spike (or drop) in American search interest during that window.
• The anticipated HBO documentary has no announced release timing, so it poses no measurable influence inside the period.

Remaining information gaps
a) Exact Google Trends interest value on 17 Feb 2026 (U.S.).  
b) Confirmation from television-guest listings (e.g., NBC Today, ABC GMA, late-night shows) or from Penguin Random House’s author-tour calendar that no U.S. bookings have been quietly added for 18–26 Feb.  
c) Any subsequent HBO or Warner Bros. Discovery press note that sets even a tentative premiere frame (e.g., “late 2026”) for the documentary.

Absent these missing pieces, all available evidence indicates that—barring an unforeseen news break—U.S. search interest in “gisele pelicot” is unlikely to see a scheduled boost or decline between 17 Feb and 26 Feb 2026.</Agent_report>
