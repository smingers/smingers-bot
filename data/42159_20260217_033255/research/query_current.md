Analysis:
To estimate whether Google search interest in “gisele pelicot” will rise or fall over the next nine days, I first need to learn who or what “Gisele Pelicot” is and whether anything news-worthy (film/album launch, award nomination, court case, viral clip, death rumor, etc.) is scheduled or breaking during 17-26 Feb 2026. Relevant information is most likely to appear:
• on general websites (biographies, social-media announcements, event listings) – best found with a regular Google search;  
• in the professional news ecosystem – best found with Google News;  
• in forward-looking or inside-industry coverage (interviews, press releases, entertainment/arts calendars) – AskNews can surface these.

Therefore the three searches focus on (a) identifying the person, (b) capturing any current or just-posted coverage, and (c) probing for announced future events within the time window.
