Analysis:
To judge whether search interest will rise, fall, or stay flat, I first need to establish who/what “gisele pelicot” is (person, brand, event, etc.) and whether anything likely to drive new searches is scheduled during the 9-day window. Catalysts could include a concert, film/TV release, book launch, viral social-media post, obituary, award, birthday, or coverage tied to a broader news story. Historical search-volume patterns (spikes or flatlines) will also help gauge how volatile this term usually is. Therefore I will:
• Identify the subject and existing web presence (Google).
• Look for very recent or upcoming coverage (Google News).
• Ask the Agent to dig for any dated future events, anniversaries, or scheduled publicity between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-26 that could affect Google searches (Agent).
• Pull the last 90 days of Google Trends data to see baseline volatility and any recent momentum (Google Trends).
