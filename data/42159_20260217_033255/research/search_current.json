The book, co-written with journalist and novelist Judith Perrignon, will be released in over 20 languages worldwide. In her first-person account, Pelicot recounts her traumatic experiences\u2014being drugged and subjected to non-consensual rapes by nearly 50 men orchestrated by her former husband\u2014spanning nearly a decade, while also detailing her difficult childhood, professional life, and motherhood. She emphasizes her enduring pursuit of happiness and dignity. The memoir reflects on her personal reconstruction after the violence and includes her intention to visit her ex-husband in prison to 'understand' his betrayal as part of her healing process. Pelicot became a global feminist symbol for her resilience and her decision to make the judicial proceedings\u2014known as the 'juicio de Mazan'\u2014public, shifting the shame from victim to perpetrator. The book, which ends on a note of hope and determination to live, has been praised by booksellers, including Caroline Paumier of Fontaine V.H. in Paris, who described it as a powerful work with 'important declarations' that will help many.

The book, released on February 16, 2026, chronicles her decade-long ordeal, during which her husband filmed the assaults to fuel his fantasies and expand his power, involving over 80 perpetrators. The trial, saturated with documented evidence, focused not on truth alone but on questioning her credibility\u2014framing her as either complicit or mentally compromised. In contrast, the memoir avoids sensationalism and instead presents a deeply personal account rooted in familial complexity: an absent mother, a troubled father, a strained brother relationship, financial struggles, and marital difficulties. Pelicot rejects the 'good victim' archetype and resists idolization, emphasizing her humanity and the need for authenticity. She reflects on her children\u2019s trauma, honors her mother\u2019s legacy of 'the will to live,' and expresses gratitude to women who supported her at the Avignon courthouse. Ultimately, she seeks not admiration but clarity: 'I try to disarm the excess of admiration in their eyes.

She emphasizes that her story is not one of victimhood but of resilience, stating, 'I am happy to offer my story as an example and my name as a banner.'

Her book, co-written with Judith Perrignon, is described as a message of hope for women enduring hardship and a reclamation of her narrative. This marks her first major public appearances since testifying in the landmark Avignon trial, where her ex-husband and 50 co-accused were convicted of aggravated rape, sexual assault, and attempted rape. Her media tour began with a feature in Le Monde and a televised interview on France 5\u2019s 'La Grande Librairie,' where she emphasized inner strength and resilience. The tour has been amplified by a viral podcast excerpt from The New York Times, which featured her recounting the traumatic discovery of photos taken during her drugging at Carpentras police station\u2014images that drew 2 million views in 24 hours and prompted Flammarion to demand their removal from Brut and 'Quotidien.' International media outlets, including BBC, Vogue, El Pa\u00eds, Corriere della Sera, and Spiegel, secured exclusive interviews. The audiobook version, narrated by Emma Thompson, was praised for its emotional power and capacity to inspire courage. Pelicot\u2019s tour will extend to London, Hamburg, Munich, Madrid, Barcelona, Canada, and New York, with French book signings scheduled in Bordeaux, Nancy, Montpellier, Aix-en-Provence, and Strasbourg. She stated that her testimony is not for herself but for women who have experienced chemical submission, noting that her story now belongs to all who have found strength through her example. The book is widely regarded as the most anticipated of 2026.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 05:58 AM\nSource:[Franceinfo](https://www.franceinfo.fr/faits-divers/affaire-des-viols-de-mazan/elle-ne-promeut-pas-seulement-un-objet-culturel-elle-promeut-une-cause-la-tournee-mediatique-de-gisele-pelicot-paracheve-son-statut-d-icone-feministe-mondiale_7800911.html)\n\n**Gis\u00e8le Pelicot: Five Key Points from the Woman Who Raised a Global Cry Against Sexual Abuse**\nGis\u00e8le Pelicot, 73, has emerged as a global feminist icon in 2024 after transforming her traumatic experience into a public fight against sexual violence. On December 19, 2024, her ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, was convicted of orchestrating over 200 rapes over nearly a decade, with 50 men found guilty of sexual assault in the same trial. At the courthouse in southern France, Pelicot declared, 'Shame must change sides,' a rallying cry that reshaped the narrative on sexual violence in France and beyond. Her new memoir, 'A Hymn to Life: Shame Must Change Sides,' is set to be released next week. In her first televised interview since the trial, aired on France 5 on February 4, 2026, she recounted discovering her husband had been drugging her with sleeping pills and inviting strangers to assault her while he filmed the acts. She described dissociating during the moment she saw the evidence, stating, 'I don\u2019t recognize myself in those photos. That\u2019s not me.' She recalled earlier signs\u2014yellow stains on pants, a suspiciously changing beer color\u2014but did not act on them at the time. Despite the trauma, she intends to visit her ex-husband in prison as part of her healing process, saying she wants to 'look him in the eyes and ask: Why did you do this?' She described her 50-year marriage as complex, expressing betrayal yet holding onto happy memories as her only remaining legacy. Her family relationships remain strained; her daughter Caroline is slowly healing, while her son David 'needs more time.' Pelicot also revealed a new relationship with a man named Jean-Loup, whom she met in 2023 and described as someone who 'also went through difficult times,' saying their connection 'changed our lives.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 03:53 PM\nSource:[R7 Not\u00edcias](https://noticias.r7.com/internacional/gisele-pelicot-cinco-pontos-principais-da-mulher-que-lancou-um-grito-de-guerra-contra-o-abuso-sexual-13022026/)\n\n**Gis\u00e8le Pelicot Breaks Silence in First TV Interview After 50-Mann V\u00e5ldtekts Saga**\nGis\u00e8le Pelicot (73), who was subjected to approximately 200 sexual assaults by 50 men over nearly a decade orchestrated by her husband Dominique Pelicot, has given her first televised interview since the 2024 trial that shocked France. In the interview with France 5, she described the moment she saw images of the abuse, stating, 'I don\u2019t recognize myself in these pictures. I said: That\u2019s not me,' and recalled her mind 'shutting off' upon realizing the extent of the betrayal. She reflected on warning signs she ignored, including a yellow stain on her pants and a white beer that changed color after her husband added what he claimed was mint syrup. She also revealed her intention to visit her former husband in prison as part of her healing process, asking him directly, 'Why did you do this?' Despite profound feelings of betrayal and devastation, she expressed a desire to preserve happy memories from their 50-year marriage. Pelicot has found love again with a man named Jean-Loup, whom she met in 2023. Her decision to break her silence has been hailed as a turning point in the national conversation on sexual violence. Her new book, 'A Hymn to Life: Shame Has to Change Sides,' is set for release next week. In December 2024, Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to the maximum penalty for orchestrating the abuse, and 50 other men were convicted; one later had his sentence increased to ten years in 2025 after an appeal.\nOriginal language: no\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 06:49 AM\nSource:[VG](https://www.vg.no/nyheter/i/K8zjy6/gisele-pelicot-bryter-tausheten)\n\n**From London to Hamburg: Unprecedented Global Media Attention for Gis\u00e8le Pelicot's Book 'Et la joie de vivre'**\nGis\u00e8le Pelicot's memoir, 'Et la joie de vivre,' is set to be published on February 17, 2024, by Flammarion, following her global prominence after the high-profile 2024 Avignon trial involving 51 accused individuals. The book, written in the first person, recounts her experiences during the trial, including her decision to demand a public hearing instead of a closed-door session, a choice that significantly amplified international media attention. The memoir will be translated into 22 languages, reflecting its global reach. The New York Times has already highlighted it as one of the essential reads for February, and exclusive interviews with Pelicot are scheduled for the publication, including a video excerpt where she describes a police officer showing her a photo of herself during a sexual assault. Her literary agent, Susanna Lee, confirmed that Pelicot is scheduled for interviews with major international outlets including The New Yorker, Vogue, BBC, CBS, El Pa\u00eds, Corriere della Serra, and Spiegel. In Germany, the Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung confirmed plans for a major event in Hamburg, with nearly 1,000 tickets sold within 48 hours, underscoring widespread public interest. Prior to the Hamburg event, Pelicot will appear in London on February 20, where actresses Kate Winslet and Kristin Scott Thomas will read excerpts from the audiobook, recorded by Emma Thompson. The memoir also details Pelicot\u2019s internal struggle over her decision to reject a private trial, questioning whether closing the door would have shielded the perpetrators from public accountability: 'Est-ce que je ne les prot\u00e9geais pas en fermant la porte?' she writes, emphasizing her belief that shame should not be borne by victims but by perpetrators.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 11, 2026 07:10 PM\nSource:[Radio France](https://www.radiofrance.fr/franceinter/podcasts/l-info-de-france-inter/de-londres-a-hambourg-la-mediatisation-hors-norme-du-livre-de-gisele-pelicot-et-la-joie-de-vivre-5715812)\n\n**Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in Italy on March 18: 'I Still Have Faith in People' \u2013 Book Launch and Public Talk**\nGis\u00e8le Pelicot, a symbol of the fight against gender-based sexual violence in France and globally, is set to visit Turin, Italy, on March 18 for 'Aspettando il Salone,' an event leading up to the Turin Book Fair. Her memoir, 'Un inno alla vita' (An Ode to Life), published by Rizzoli on February 19 in Italy and internationally on February 17, recounts her harrowing experience of being drugged by her husband, Dominique Pelicot, for nearly a decade and subjected to repeated sexual abuse by dozens of men. Despite the trauma, Pelicot expresses enduring faith in people, stating, 'I still have faith in people. It was my greatest weakness, today it is my greatest strength.' The book, which includes her globally recognized quote 'Shame must change sides,' details her childhood, first love, career, motherhood, the hidden abuse, and her emotional recovery. Her courageous decision to abandon anonymity and pursue a public trial in 2020\u2014after her husband was arrested for filming women\u2019s skirts and later found to have orchestrated a systematic abuse campaign\u2014sparked international attention and led to legal reforms in France. Pelicot, recently awarded France\u2019s highest honor, the Legion of Honour, will speak at the University of Turin\u2019s Aula Magna with Annalena Benini on March 18 at 6:30 PM. Her story is one of transformation, compassion, and resilience, illustrating how an ordinary life can become extraordinary in the face of catastrophe.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 03:05 PM\nSource:[ANSA.it](https://www.ansa.it/sito/notizie/cultura/libri/2026/02/04/gisele-pelicot-in-italia-il-18-marzo-ho-ancora-fiducia-nelle-persone_12527c22-1b01-4a6c-b9b5-318072bacfd2.html)\n\n**Fall Pelicot: Experiment Shows Sexual Abuse Schemes Are Repeatable Everywhere**\nA 2025 experiment by Canadian journalist Hugo Meunier, inspired by the high-profile case of Gis\u00e8le Pelicot in Mazan, France, tested whether the sexual abuse scenario described in the case\u2014where a woman was repeatedly drugged and raped by multiple men\u2014could be replicated elsewhere. Meunier posted a fake advertisement on a dating platform resembling Dominique Pelicot\u2019s original post on the now-suspended site coco.gg, offering a sedated woman for sexual acts. Within two minutes, two men responded; within 48 hours, 105 men expressed interest. Only three inquired about consent, and only one acknowledged the act as rape. Meunier, in collaboration with director Clo\u00e9 Giroux, produced a documentary titled 'Pr\u00eats \u00e0 coucher avec une femme endormie' (Ready to Sleep with a Sleeping Woman), featuring Gis\u00e8le Pelicot\u2019s daughter Caroline Darian, who argued that the case was merely the 'tree hiding the forest'\u2014indicating widespread, unreported demand for such acts. The fake ad was removed after two weeks, and several user accounts were blocked. The article also reveals that French authorities had previously investigated Dominique Pelicot in 2010 for secretly filming women, but the case was lost in bureaucratic overload. He was only re-arrested in 2020 after another incident, leading to a 2024 trial where he received a 20-year sentence and 50 others were convicted. The case prompted reforms in French sexual law, explicitly criminalizing non-consensual acts. Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, who chose public testimony, became a symbol of resistance against sexual violence. Her statement that 'ordinary men can become rapists' underscored the broader societal issue. The experiment concluded that such predatory fantasies remain highly accessible and widely sought, even in a post-scandal world.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 03:23 PM\nSource:[Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung](https://www.nzz.ch/international/fall-pelicot-ein-online-experiment-zeigt-dass-das-verbrechen-wiederholbar-ist-ld.1921008)\n\n**HBO Max Prepares Documentary on Gis\u00e8le Pelicot**\nHBO Max has officially announced the production of a documentary on Gis\u00e8le Pelicot, a survivor of the Mazan rape case, with the film set to premiere on HBO Max in early 2026.
