Police subsequently discovered over 20,000 photos and videos on his devices showing his wife Gis\u00e8le being raped while drugged unconscious by more than 70 different men over nearly a decade.\n\n- **The Trial:** A 2024 rape trial lasting three months took place in Avignon. In December, Dominique Pelicot (72) and 50 others were convicted of rape, attempted rape, or sexual assault. 17 defendants have since appealed their convictions.\n\n- **Rape Statistics in France:** \n  - A French parliamentary study in January estimated only 20% of rape survivors press charges\n  - About 94% of those cases are dismissed without trial, according to one study last year\n\n- **Legal Context:** Unlike the U.S. and many European countries, France does not define rape as sex without consent, but rather as intercourse committed by violence, surprise, constraint, or threat. The French Parliament is now debating how to change this definition.\n\n- **The Defendants:** The attackers included fathers and husbands from various professions (a nurse, a journalist, truck drivers). Many argued that Dominique's invitations seemed equivalent to having Gis\u00e8le's permission.\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n- **Antoine Camus (Gis\u00e8le's lawyer):** Expressed dismay that the men claimed the videos didn't show rape. He believes the case might force legal changes: \"This is the first time in France you have deep thinking on this. I think there will be a 'before' and 'after' of this trial.\"\n\n- **Anne Bouillon (attorney specializing in representing survivors, based in Nantes):** Stated that Gis\u00e8le \"does not want medals pinned on her jacket. She wants things to change.\" She reports hearing from clients daily who mention Gis\u00e8le Pelicot \"as an authorization to speak out.\"\n\n- **Gis\u00e8le Pelicot herself:** Testified in October 2024 that her motivation was \"not simply courage\" but \"will and determination to change society.\" She wanted to show other rape victims that \"Madame Pelicot did it, we can do it too.\"\n\n## Public Response:\n\n- Thousands marched in support of Gis\u00e8le\n- Murals of her face appeared across France\n- A banner reading \"merci gis\u00e8le\" hung from Avignon's ancient ramparts\n- She waived her legal right to anonymity and insisted on attending the entire trial with the footage aired publicly\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.theguardian.com/books/2025/mar/20/gisele-pelicot-memoir-a-hymn-to-life\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Gis\u00e8le Pelicot announces she will publish a memoir\"\n\n**Source:** The Guardian  \n**Date:** March 20, 2025  \n**Author:** Ella Creamer\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n1. **Memoir Publication**: Gis\u00e8le Pelicot is publishing a memoir titled \"A Hymn to Life\" scheduled for release on January 27, 2026.\n\n2. **Publication Details**: The book will be published simultaneously in English, French, and 20 other languages by The Bodley Head (a Penguin imprint).\n\n3. **Background Context**: Pelicot became internationally known after waiving her right to anonymity in a trial where her ex-husband, Dominique Pelicot, was found guilty of drugging and raping her, and inviting dozens of strangers to abuse her over nearly a decade.\n\n4. **Trial Outcome**: Dominique Pelicot was sentenced to 20 years in prison in December.

List dates, event types, and estimated publicity size.\nKnown U-S-related activity for Gis\u00e8le Pelicot during the forecast window 17 \u2013 26 February 2026 centers on the launch of her memoir.  No concerts, stage performances, commemorative anniversaries or other scheduled public events in the United States were found for that 10-day span; however, the book release itself is large enough to generate nationwide coverage and an easily measurable bump in Google search activity.\n\nEvent 1  \n\u2022 Date: Tuesday 17 February 2026  \n\u2022 Type: Commercial release (print, e-book and audio)  \n\u2022 Description: First-day U.S. publication of \u201cA Hymn to Life: Shame Has to Change Sides,\u201d Pelicot\u2019s co-written memoir, issued by Penguin Press and distributed by Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Bookshop.org and all major digital retailers.  The English-language audiobook, narrated by Oscar-winning actress Emma Thompson, goes on sale the same day.  The launch is explicitly described by multiple outlets as a \u201csimultaneous worldwide release\u201d that includes the United States (The Guardian, 11 Feb 2026; Le Monde/AFP, 11 Feb 2026; CBS News Sunday Morning, 15 Feb 2026).  \n\n\u2022 Estimated publicity size:  \n  \u2013 Earned media: At least four national U.S. outlets had already prepared long-form packages timed to the release\u2014CBS News Sunday Morning (average 5.2 million viewers), NPR\u2019s The Sunday Story/Up First (\u22482.4 million weekly listeners for the combined feeds), the Associated Press/AFP wire carried by scores of regional newspapers (reach \u224815 million), and likely follow-on reviews in the New York Times, Washington Post and trade press (historical reach 3-5 million).  \n  \u2013 Social amplification: Emma Thompson\u2019s Instagram post promoting the audiobook (2.8 million followers) plus reposting by feminist, literary and true-crime communities is conservatively 1\u20132 million additional impressions.  \n  \u2013 Combined first-week exposure inside the U.S. therefore sits in the 20\u201330 million-impression range, easily large enough to push Google Trends values several index points.  For context, Pelicot\u2019s earlier U.S. television interview on CBS (15 Feb) aired two days before the window but will remain available on demand during the window, sustaining attention.  \n\nEvent 2  \n(No additional confirmed U.S. events in the 17 \u2013 26 Feb window)\n\n\u2022 Searches of news databases, events calendars, ticketing platforms and publisher tour schedules returned no listings for author signings, public readings, university lectures, television late-night appearances or conference keynotes involving Pelicot within the United States during the target dates.  Items located were either (a) outside the geographic scope (e.g., BBC Newsnight interview in London, Guardian and Le Monde coverage in Europe) or (b) outside the temporal window (CBS and NPR pieces aired 15 Feb; Guardian features 11 & 14 Feb).\n\nSummary table of confirmed U.S. events 17-26 Feb 2026\n\nDate                | Event type | Details                                                | Estimated first-week U.S. reach  \n--------------------|------------|--------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------  \n17 Feb 2026 (Tue)   | Book & audiobook release | \u201cA Hymn to Life: Shame Has to Change Sides\u201d (Penguin Press); audiobook read by Emma Thompson | ~20\u201330 million impressions (national television, radio, press, social)  \n\nKey take-aways for the forecast question  \n1. A single, highly publicized release\u2014Pelicot\u2019s memoir\u2014lands exactly on 17 February, the first day of the measurement window.  \n2. Pre-launch coverage already saturating U.S. national media suggests a sharp uptick in search interest on or just after 17 Feb, with sustained attention for several days as reviews and opinion pieces roll out.  \n3. No offsetting negative events or lulls are scheduled through 26 Feb.  In the absence of competing news cycles, the publicity profile points toward interest that is more likely to increase than to remain flat or decline over the period.\n\nNo further U.S. concerts, anniversaries or appearances are currently scheduled for 18 \u2013 26 February 2026.</Agent_report>\n\n<GoogleTrendsData term=\"gisele pelicot\">\nGoogle Trends US data for \"gisele pelicot\" (last 90 days):\n\nCurrent value: 70\n90-day mean: 4.8\n90-day std dev: 16.2\n\nBASE RATE ANALYSIS (using 9-day windows to match question timeframe):\n- In 77% of 9-day windows, the value changed by \u22643 points (\"Doesn't change\")\n- In 16% of 9-day windows, the value INCREASED by >3 points\n- In 7% of 9-day windows, the value DECREASED by >3 points\n\nRecent trend: increasing (last 7 days avg: 51.7 vs prior 7 days: 1.6)\n\nDAILY VALUES (last 30 days):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-19,0\n2026-01-20,0\n2026-01-21,0\n2026-01-22,3\n2026-01-23,3\n2026-01-24,3\n2026-01-25,0\n2026-01-26,0\n2026-01-27,0\n2026-01-28,0\n2026-01-29,0\n2026-01-30,0\n2026-01-31,0\n2026-02-01,0\n2026-02-02,0\n2026-02-03,2\n2026-02-04,2\n2026-02-05,2\n2026-02-06,1\n2026-02-07,2\n2026-02-08,1\n2026-02-09,1\n2026-02-10,2\n2026-02-11,5\n2026-02-12,12\n2026-02-13,53\n2026-02-14,68\n2026-02-15,100\n2026-02-16,54\n2026-02-17,70\n\nNote: Google Trends values are relative (0-100 scale), not absolute search volumes.\n</GoogleTrendsData>\n"
