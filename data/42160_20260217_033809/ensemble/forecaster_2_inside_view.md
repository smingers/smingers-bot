## Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (High Quality, Factual):**
1. **Yahoo Finance snapshot (Feb 16, 2026)**: Real-time market data showing CI closed at $291.44 on Feb 16, with previous close $287.61. Provides factual metrics: 52-week range $239.51-$350.00, market cap $77.85B, ex-dividend date March 5, 2026. High reliability for factual data.

2. **Cigna Q4/FY2025 earnings (Feb 5, 2026)**: Company press release showing Q4 adjusted EPS $8.08 vs $6.64 prior year, FY2025 adjusted EPS $29.84. 2026 guidance: at least $30.25 EPS, ~$280B revenue. Dividend increased to $1.56/quarter. Factual financial data, audited and reliable.

3. **FTC Settlement announcement (Feb 5, 2026)**: $7B in customer relief over 10 years, transition to rebate-free pharmacy model. At least 50% of Evernorth business adopting by end 2028. Factual regulatory development with clear timeline.

**Secondary Sources (Moderate Quality, Mixed Fact/Opinion):**
4. **Analyst ratings compilation (Jan-Feb 2026)**: Multiple sources showing consensus "Moderate Buy" with average target $330 (range $297-$338). 17 Buy ratings, 5 Hold. These are opinions but from identifiable experts (Guggenheim, Truist, RBC, etc.).

5. **MarketBeat articles (Feb 12-16, 2026)**: Institutional trading activity showing 86.99% institutional ownership, mixed buying/selling. Factual ownership data but limited predictive value.

**Irrelevant Sources:**
The AskNews articles are almost entirely about different tickers (CION, PART.JK, CIBN, etc.) with only tangential mentions of "CI" in unrelated contexts. The Indus Towers, CICC, and CIFR articles are completely unrelated. Only the CACI article has any relevance as a defense/healthcare adjacent stock, but provides no information about Cigna specifically.

## Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Ex-dividend date March 5, 2026**: Multiple independent sources confirm this. Stocks typically experience buying pressure in the 10-15 trading days before ex-dividend date, with empirical studies showing +0.2-0.3% abnormal returns. This is a structural factor with well-documented historical patterns. The timeframe (Feb 17-28) falls entirely within this pre-ex-dividend window.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Recent positive momentum**: Stock rose from $287.61 (Feb 15 close) to $291.44 (Feb 16 close), a +1.33% gain. Trading above 50-day MA ($276.85) and 200-day MA ($283.57), indicating technical strength.
- **Strong Q4 earnings beat**: Reported Feb 5, EPS $8.08 vs estimate $7.88 (+2.5% beat), revenue $72.5B vs $69.53B estimate (+4.3% beat). Positive earnings surprises historically correlate with 5-10 day post-announcement drift.
- **Analyst consensus bullish**: Average target $330 vs current $291.44 implies +13% upside. While not directly predictive of 9-day moves, indicates no imminent negative catalysts expected.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **FTC settlement**: While significant long-term, the market had 11 days to digest this news by Feb 17. Any immediate impact already reflected in price.
- **Institutional trading**: Mixed signals with some buying, some selling. No clear directional indicator.

## Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 9 trading days (Feb 17-28, 2026)

**If halved to 4-5 days**: Probability would decrease slightly to ~55%. Shorter windows reduce the cumulative effect of positive drift and dividend-capture buying, while maintaining similar volatility risk.

**If doubled to 18 days**: Probability would increase to ~60-62%. Longer window allows more time for positive drift to compound and extends deeper into the pre-ex-dividend period (through March 5), strengthening the mechanical bid.

## Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Starting base rate: 57%** (S&P 500 stock, 9-day horizon, adjusted for CI's lower volatility and pre-ex-dividend timing)

**Positive factors warranting upward adjustment:**
1. **Recent earnings momentum** (+1.5pp): The Feb 5 earnings beat typically generates 5-10 day positive drift. We're now 8 trading days post-earnings, but momentum often extends 10-15 days. Studies show post-earnings announcement drift averages +0.5-1.0% over 10 days for beats of this magnitude.

2. **Technical position** (+1.0pp): Trading 5.3% above 50-day MA and 2.8% above 200-day MA indicates established uptrend. Short-term momentum favors continuation.

3. **No negative catalysts** (+0.5pp): No earnings, regulatory events, or major announcements scheduled Feb 17-28. Absence of known downside risks in a short window slightly favors status quo/upward drift.

**Negative factors:**
1. **Recent sharp gain** (-1.0pp): The +1.33% move on Feb 16 may represent some near-term exhaustion. Stock at $291.44 is still well below 52-week high of $350 but has risen ~5% in recent sessions.

2. **Market volatility risk** (-0.5pp): Beta of 0.27-0.28 suggests CI is defensive, but broader market moves can still drive short-term price action independent of fundamentals.

**Net adjustment: +1.5pp from outside view base of 57% → 58.5%**

This modest shift is justified because:
- The earnings beat and pre-ex-dividend mechanics are well-documented phenomena with historical precedent
- The 9-day window is short enough that structural factors (dividend capture) dominate over longer-term uncertainty
- Current circumstances (recent earnings, technical position) are analogous to the reference class but with slightly favorable positioning

## Probability Calibration

The outside view base rate of 57% already incorporates:
- Positive equity drift over 9 days
- CI's lower volatility (higher Sharpe ratio)
- Generic pre-ex-dividend buying pressure

The inside view evidence adds:
- Specific recent earnings beat momentum
- Confirmed technical strength
- Absence of near-term negative catalysts
- Slight offset from recent gains

**Calibrated probability: 58-59%**

This represents a modest 1-2 percentage point increase from the base rate, reflecting that current circumstances are slightly more favorable than the average historical instance, but not dramatically different. The shift is conservative because:
- 9-day windows have high inherent noise (σ ≈ 3%)
- Most relevant information (earnings, FTC settlement) already reflected in current price
- Dividend capture effect, while real, is typically only 0.2-0.3% in magnitude

A 58% probability implies: "In 100 similar situations, CI would close higher on Feb 28 than Feb 17 in 58 cases." This feels appropriately calibrated—slightly better than a coin flip, but far from certain.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will CI stock price on Feb 28, 2026 close exceed its Feb 17, 2026 close? 9 trading days. ✓ Aligned.

2. **Outside view base**: 57% for S&P 500 stock over 9 days, adjusted for CI's characteristics. Final 58% is anchored to this. ✓

3. **Consistency**: "58 out of 100 times, CI closes higher on Feb 28 than Feb 17." Yes, this aligns with modest positive drift, recent momentum, and pre-ex-dividend buying, offset by short-term noise. ✓

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Ex-dividend March 5 creates mechanical buying pressure (verified across multiple sources)
   - Q4 earnings beat Feb 5 generates post-announcement drift (verified, typical magnitude)
   - Trading above 50/200-day MAs indicates technical strength (verified from Yahoo Finance)
   - Recent +1.33% gain may indicate near-term exhaustion (factual price movement)
   - No scheduled negative catalysts Feb 17-28 (verified from earnings calendar)
   All evidence is factually sound. ✓

5. **Blind spot**: Broader market correction. If S&P 500 drops 2-3% in this period (e.g., due to macro news, Fed commentary, geopolitical event), CI would likely follow despite positive idiosyncratic factors. This could drop probability to ~45%. However, no specific catalyst is visible, and 9-day windows typically see <1% S&P moves.

6. **Status quo**: Current price $291.44 is recent, stable position. Low volatility (β=0.27) suggests status quo is "modest drift higher" rather than "unchanged." 9-day window has moderate volatility (3% σ), so slight bias toward continuation of recent uptrend is reasonable. ✓

Probability: 58%
