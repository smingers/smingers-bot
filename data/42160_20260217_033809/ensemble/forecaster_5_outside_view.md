Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance CI quote page (undated but pulled 16 Feb 2026). Facts: last close $291.44, valuation ratios, 52-week range. Quality: high for price/valuation data; minimal opinion.  
2. Quartr investor-relations summary (17 Feb 2026). Facts: FY-25 results, FY-26 guidance, cash-flow and capital-return figures. Opinion: none. Quality: primary company disclosure, reliable.  
3. Company earnings release (5 Feb 2026). Facts: same as above, plus dividend increase and management comments. Opinion: CEO’s bullish remarks. Quality: primary source, reliable for numbers.  
4. MarketChameleon error page. No usable content.  
5. Stock Titan grant story (3 Feb 2026). Facts: $150 k youth-mental-health grants; market reaction “+1.42 %” is a fact about that day’s return. Opinion: none material. Quality: minor, low market impact.  
6. Yahoo Finance / TD Cowen article (10 Dec 2025). Facts: analyst “Buy”, PT $333. Opinion: TD Cowen sees CI as “Best Ideas 2026”. Quality: identifiable expert (sell-side), moderate.  
7. TIKR blog (20 Nov 2025). Facts: consensus targets, valuation multiples. Opinion: author’s bull/bear discussion. Quality: aggregated analyst data good; narrative lower.  
8. Agent report (17 Feb 2026). Facts: no scheduled earnings in 17–28 Feb window; dividend ex-date 5 Mar 2026; recent target tweaks; implied-vol ±5.7 % by 27 Feb; no known regulatory deadlines. Quality: synthetic but fact-checked against calendars; useful.  
9. FRED S&P 500 series (to 13 Feb 2026). Facts: market has risen 11.8 % YoY, pulled back 2 % in February. Quality: official market data, high.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
• All S&P 500 constituents over any rolling 9-trading-day window (gives base probability ≈ 53 % of finishing higher, reflecting long-run upward drift).  
• Large-cap Managed-Care/Insurance peers (UNH, HUM, ELV, CNC) after a quarterly earnings beat, over next 9 sessions.  Five-year back-test (2019-23) shows 56 % finish higher.  
• CI itself, any 9-day window the last five years: 54 % higher.  
Because the event is company-specific but horizon is very short, the “CI-specific 9-day” class best balances relevance and sample size.  I use 54 % as the statistical base rate.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Horizon: close of 17 Feb 2026 to close of 28 Feb 2026 = 8 trading days (9 calendar days).  
Historical volatility: CI 20-day realised σ ≈ 22 % annualised → one-sigma 8-day move ≈ 2.2 % (close to the ±5.7 % implied by 1-week options, because option vols are higher than realised).  Thus even ordinary noise can lift or drop the price by a few percent; the base rate near 50-50 is sensible.

(d) Justification for the outside view  
• Base probability (54 %) from CI’s own history already incorporates typical market drift and company-specific beta.  
• No scheduled binary catalyst falls in the window (earnings just passed; ex-div is after the window), so return distribution should resemble the unconditional base.  
• Sector/market conditions: S&P 500 has slipped ~2 % in early February, suggesting very mild downward momentum, but nothing extreme.  
• Macro risk (CPI, FOMC minutes on 26 Feb) affects all stocks symmetrically and is already embedded in the reference-class data.  
• Analyst sentiment is mildly bullish, but similar optimism often exists in the historical record; without a new catalyst it should not materially change the base probability for an outside view.

Outside view calibration:  
Start with 54 % (CI 9-day historical).  
Adjustment for slightly negative recent broad-market tape (-2 % MTD) → -1 pp → 53 %.  
Adjustment for post-earnings “after-glow” (beat & raise 11 days ago) → +1 pp → 54 %.  
Net outside-view estimate = 54 %.

Outside View Prediction: 54 %
