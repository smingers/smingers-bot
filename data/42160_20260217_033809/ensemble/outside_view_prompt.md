<Agent_report>
Query: Identify any scheduled corporate events, earnings releases, dividend dates, or major regulatory decisions for The Cigna Group (CI) between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-28, and list recent analyst rating changes or significant news likely to affect its share price during that window.
The 12-day window that begins at the close on Tuesday 17 February 2026 and ends at the close on Friday 28 February 2026 is quiet for The Cigna Group in terms of formally scheduled events. The table below summarises everything that is currently slated or can reasonably be anticipated to fall inside, or to have market impact during, that period.

1. Scheduled corporate events 
• Earnings – none.  Cigna reported its Q4-25 and FY-25 results and hosted the earnings call on 5 Feb 2026; the next earnings event (Q1-26) is not until late April (MarketScreener calendar, 2026-04-30 projected). Some third-party calendar spiders list duplicate “Q4-25 earnings release” placeholders on 25–26 Feb 2026, but the definitive release is already complete, so these can be disregarded (MarketScreener, headings “2026-02-25” and “2026-02-26”).  
• Investor conferences – none are listed for 17–28 Feb 2026 on the MarketScreener feed, Cigna’s own IR site, or Quartr (MarketScreener; Quartr, 17 Feb 2026 update).  
• Dividend timetable – the key date visible to the market in this window is the approaching ex-dividend date of Thursday 5 March 2026 for the newly-raised quarterly dividend of $1.56 per share (DividendInvestor.com, 2 Feb 2026; SlickCharts dividend table).  Although the cash leaves on 19 March, price‐adjustment expectations are often discounted ahead of the ex-date, so this could influence trading during the window.  
• Buyback activity – management reiterated on 5 Feb that share repurchases remain part of the 2026 capital-allocation plan, but no specific buyback launch dates were given (Quartr transcript highlights). Buybacks therefore remain an open supportive factor but not a known calendar event.

2. Dividend details 
• Declaration date: 5 Feb 2026 (DividendInvestor.com, SlickCharts)  
• Amount: $1.56 (up $0.05 QoQ)  
• Ex-dividend / record date: 5 Mar 2026  
• Payment date: 19 Mar 2026  
Implication for the 17-28 Feb window: investors positioning for the dividend capture strategy may provide incremental demand; equally, some holders may sell after 5 Mar, so short-dated options pricing around 28 Feb could reflect this.

3. Major regulatory decisions or developments 
• FTC pharmacy-benefit-manager (PBM) case – Cigna reached a “global settlement” with the FTC over insulin-pricing transparency as part of the earnings-day disclosures (Fierce Healthcare, 5 Feb 2026).  The agreement commits Cigna/Evernorth to $7 bn of consumer cost relief over 10 years and to structural changes in its PBM offering.  
• Earlier, on 25 Jan 2026, the FTC had paused its administrative proceeding for 14 days, widely read as a pre-settlement manoeuvre (Sahm Capital, 25 Jan 2026). That pause expired before our window and culminated in the 5 Feb settlement.  No new FTC milestones are scheduled for 17–28 Feb, but investor scrutiny of implementation details, state-level follow-on actions, and peer reactions remains high.  
• Legislative risk – industry-wide PBM-transparency legislation continues through Congress; however, no committee votes or rule-making deadlines fall in the specified window.  Therefore, headline regulatory catalysts specific to Cigna are not expected between 17 Feb and 28 Feb.

4. Recent analyst rating/target changes with potential to influence sentiment in the window 
(All dates 2026)  
• 7 Feb – Wall Street Zen upgrades CI to “Buy” from “Hold” (MarketBeat compilation).  
• 6 Feb – Barclays trims price target to $303 from $305, keeps “Overweight” (MarketBeat).  
• 10 Feb – Deutsche Bank maintains “Buy”, nudges PT to $304 from $301 (Meyka note, 11 Feb).  
• 6 Feb – Sanford Bernstein reiterates “Market Perform”, PT $307 (MarketBeat).  
Consensus as of 16 Feb: 17 Buys / 5 Holds; average target ≈ $330 (MarketBeat).  No downgrades have been issued since the Q4 print; the drift in targets has been slightly upward, supporting a constructive tone heading into the study period.

5. Significant fundamental/news items likely to colour trading sentiment during the window 
• FY-25 results and FY-26 guidance – management guided to at least $30.25 in adjusted EPS for 2026, above the Street’s $29.77 median (Quartr earnings summary, 17 Feb 2026).  Investors are still digesting this beat-and-raise profile.  
• Sale of Medicare Advantage business – closed March 2025; removes a lower-margin line and compresses top-line growth in Cigna Healthcare, a theme analysts are modelling.  
• New transparent, fee-based PBM model at Express Scripts – management expects 50 % client adoption by end-2028 (Fierce Healthcare, 5 Feb), signalling strategic repositioning that could re-rate the stock if early uptake data emerge.  
• Macro/peer prints – peers such as Humana report later (Finviz preview), so read-across on medical-cost trends may arrive during the window and echo in CI’s price.  
• Options market – 27 Feb weekly options imply a ±5.7 % one-sigma move by expiry (yFinance implied-vol data), reflecting residual post-earnings uncertainty but no event-specific spike.

6. Summary of what could move CI’s share price 17–28 Feb 2026 
Positive drivers:  
• Continued after-glow of the FY-25 beat and FY-26 guidance raise.  
• Dividend-capture positioning ahead of 5 Mar ex-date.  
• Ongoing share buybacks (open-market discretion).  
• Recent cluster of reaffirmed/raised analyst targets.  

Negative/overhang factors:  
• Investor worry about execution of the FTC settlement and margin effects of the new PBM model; any surprise state AG actions could surface unexpectedly.  
• Sector-wide medical-cost ratio commentary from competitors (Humana, UnitedHealth) that might re-focus attention on elevated utilisation trends.  
• Technical pressure if the stock approaches the 52-week high of $350 or fails to hold the post-earnings breakout around $290.

Information gaps 
No public schedule currently details implementation checkpoints for the FTC agreement, and Cigna has not supplied a specific buyback timetable.  Otherwise, the corporate calendar between 17 Feb and 28 Feb appears fully captured.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
