The table below summarises everything that is currently slated or can reasonably be anticipated to fall inside, or to have market impact during, that period.\n\n1. Scheduled corporate events\u2028\n\u2022 Earnings \u2013 none.  Cigna reported its Q4-25 and FY-25 results and hosted the earnings call on 5 Feb 2026; the next earnings event (Q1-26) is not until late April (MarketScreener calendar, 2026-04-30 projected). Some third-party calendar spiders list duplicate \u201cQ4-25 earnings release\u201d placeholders on 25\u201326 Feb 2026, but the definitive release is already complete, so these can be disregarded (MarketScreener, headings \u201c2026-02-25\u201d and \u201c2026-02-26\u201d).  \n\u2022 Investor conferences \u2013 none are listed for 17\u201328 Feb 2026 on the MarketScreener feed, Cigna\u2019s own IR site, or Quartr (MarketScreener; Quartr, 17 Feb 2026 update).  \n\u2022 Dividend timetable \u2013 the key date visible to the market in this window is the approaching ex-dividend date of Thursday 5 March 2026 for the newly-raised quarterly dividend of $1.56 per share (DividendInvestor.com, 2 Feb 2026; SlickCharts dividend table).  Although the cash leaves on 19 March, price\u2010adjustment expectations are often discounted ahead of the ex-date, so this could influence trading during the window.  \n\u2022 Buyback activity \u2013 management reiterated on 5 Feb that share repurchases remain part of the 2026 capital-allocation plan, but no specific buyback launch dates were given (Quartr transcript highlights). Buybacks therefore remain an open supportive factor but not a known calendar event.\n\n2. Dividend details\u2028\n\u2022 Declaration date: 5 Feb 2026 (DividendInvestor.com, SlickCharts)  \n\u2022 Amount: $1.56 (up $0.05 QoQ)  \n\u2022 Ex-dividend / record date: 5 Mar 2026  \n\u2022 Payment date: 19 Mar 2026  \nImplication for the 17-28 Feb window: investors positioning for the dividend capture strategy may provide incremental demand; equally, some holders may sell after 5 Mar, so short-dated options pricing around 28 Feb could reflect this.\n\n3. Major regulatory decisions or developments\u2028\n\u2022 FTC pharmacy-benefit-manager (PBM) case \u2013 Cigna reached a \u201cglobal settlement\u201d with the FTC over insulin-pricing transparency as part of the earnings-day disclosures (Fierce Healthcare, 5 Feb 2026).  The agreement commits Cigna/Evernorth to $7 bn of consumer cost relief over 10 years and to structural changes in its PBM offering.  \n\u2022 Earlier, on 25 Jan 2026, the FTC had paused its administrative proceeding for 14 days, widely read as a pre-settlement manoeuvre (Sahm Capital, 25 Jan 2026). That pause expired before our window and culminated in the 5 Feb settlement.  No new FTC milestones are scheduled for 17\u201328 Feb, but investor scrutiny of implementation details, state-level follow-on actions, and peer reactions remains high.  \n\u2022 Legislative risk \u2013 industry-wide PBM-transparency legislation continues through Congress; however, no committee votes or rule-making deadlines fall in the specified window.  Therefore, headline regulatory catalysts specific to Cigna are not expected between 17 Feb and 28 Feb.\n\n4. Recent analyst rating/target changes with potential to influence sentiment in the window\u2028\n(All dates 2026)  \n\u2022 7 Feb \u2013 Wall Street Zen upgrades CI to \u201cBuy\u201d from \u201cHold\u201d (MarketBeat compilation).  \n\u2022 6 Feb \u2013 Barclays trims price target to $303 from $305, keeps \u201cOverweight\u201d (MarketBeat).  \n\u2022 10 Feb \u2013 Deutsche Bank maintains \u201cBuy\u201d, nudges PT to $304 from $301 (Meyka note, 11 Feb).  \n\u2022 6 Feb \u2013 Sanford Bernstein reiterates \u201cMarket Perform\u201d, PT $307 (MarketBeat).  \nConsensus as of 16 Feb: 17 Buys / 5 Holds; average target \u2248 $330 (MarketBeat).  No downgrades have been issued since the Q4 print; the drift in targets has been slightly upward, supporting a constructive tone heading into the study period.\n\n5. Significant fundamental/news items likely to colour trading sentiment during the window\u2028\n\u2022 FY-25 results and FY-26 guidance \u2013 management guided to at least $30.25 in adjusted EPS for 2026, above the Street\u2019s $29.77 median (Quartr earnings summary, 17 Feb 2026).  Investors are still digesting this beat-and-raise profile.  \n\u2022 Sale of Medicare Advantage business \u2013 closed March 2025; removes a lower-margin line and compresses top-line growth in Cigna Healthcare, a theme analysts are modelling.  \n\u2022 New transparent, fee-based PBM model at Express Scripts \u2013 management expects 50 % client adoption by end-2028 (Fierce Healthcare, 5 Feb), signalling strategic repositioning that could re-rate the stock if early uptake data emerge.  \n\u2022 Macro/peer prints \u2013 peers such as Humana report later (Finviz preview), so read-across on medical-cost trends may arrive during the window and echo in CI\u2019s price.  \n\u2022 Options market \u2013 27 Feb weekly options imply a \u00b15.7 % one-sigma move by expiry (yFinance implied-vol data), reflecting residual post-earnings uncertainty but no event-specific spike.\n\n6. Summary of what could move CI\u2019s share price 17\u201328 Feb 2026\u2028\nPositive drivers:  \n\u2022 Continued after-glow of the FY-25 beat and FY-26 guidance raise.  \n\u2022 Dividend-capture positioning ahead of 5 Mar ex-date.  \n\u2022 Ongoing share buybacks (open-market discretion).  \n\u2022 Recent cluster of reaffirmed/raised analyst targets.  \n\nNegative/overhang factors:  \n\u2022 Investor worry about execution of the FTC settlement and margin effects of the new PBM model; any surprise state AG actions could surface unexpectedly.  \n\u2022 Sector-wide medical-cost ratio commentary from competitors (Humana, UnitedHealth) that might re-focus attention on elevated utilisation trends.  \n\u2022 Technical pressure if the stock approaches the 52-week high of $350 or fails to hold the post-earnings breakout around $290.\n\nInformation gaps\u2028\nNo public schedule currently details implementation checkpoints for the FTC agreement, and Cigna has not supplied a specific buyback timetable.  Otherwise, the corporate calendar between 17 Feb and 28 Feb appears fully captured.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"SP500\" query=\"SP500\">\nFRED Economic Data: S&P 500\nSeries ID: SP500\nUnits: Index\nFrequency: Daily, Close\nLatest observation: 6836.17 (2026-02-13)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=6324.77, min=4982.77, max=6978.60\n- 5-year: mean=4932.67, min=3577.03, max=6978.60\n- 10-year: mean=3829.50, min=1895.58, max=6978.60\n- All-time: mean=3829.50, min=1895.58, max=6978.60 (since 2016-02-16)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: -90.43 (-1.3%)\n- 3-month change: +102.06 (+1.5%)\n- 6-month change: +386.37 (+6.0%)\n- Year-over-year: 6836.17 vs 6115.07 (+11.8%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily, Close):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-29,6969.01\n2026-01-30,6939.03\n2026-02-02,6976.44\n2026-02-03,6917.81\n2026-02-04,6882.72\n2026-02-05,6798.40\n2026-02-06,6932.30\n2026-02-09,6964.82\n2026-02-10,6941.81\n2026-02-11,6941.47\n2026-02-12,6832.76\n2026-02-13,6836.17\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
