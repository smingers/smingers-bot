Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**From Outside View Package:**

1. **Public.com Earnings Summary** - Factual data on Q4 2025 earnings (Feb 13, 2026): COIN missed EPS expectations ($0.66 actual vs $1.05 expected, -37%). High quality, recent, machine-generated data.

2. **Yahoo Finance Article (Feb 11, 2026)** - Named author Nauman Khan. Factual: COIN down ~32% in January, trading ~$160-165, market cap $43B. Opinion: Some analysts call it undervalued. Moderate quality, timely.

3. **Fool.com Article** - Factual: $925B trading volume in first 3 quarters 2025, net income $3.2B. Analyst opinions: 19/34 Buy ratings, average PT $341. Mixed quality - combines facts with speculative price targets.

4. **Benzinga Article (Jan 2026)** - Factual: Trading ~$210, 52-week high $444.64, P/E 23.25. Analyst split: 13 Buy/10 Hold/2 Sell. 2030 projection $255. Moderate quality but dated (written before recent drop to $164).

5. **TechStock² Article (Feb 14, 2026)** - Factual: COIN jumped 16% on Friday Feb 14 following Bitcoin rebound to ~$69,877 (+5%). Bitcoin down ~50% from October high. High quality, very recent, directly relevant.

**From AskNews Articles:**

Most AskNews articles focus on obscure meme coins and altcoins with minimal relevance to COIN stock. Key exception:

6. **SentimentTrading articles** - Multiple references to "COIN" cryptocurrency (NOT Coinbase stock). These appear to be about a different crypto token entirely. **Critical error to avoid**: These are NOT about Coinbase Global Inc. stock. Low relevance.

The AskNews feed contains no substantive information about Coinbase (COIN) stock specifically for the forecast period.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Recent earnings miss (Feb 13)**: Q4 EPS miss of 37% is material. However, stock rallied 16-18% on the news, suggesting market had priced in worse. This is a completed event with observed market reaction.
- **Bitcoin correlation**: Multiple sources confirm COIN tracks BTC closely. Bitcoin rebounded ~5% to $69,877 on Feb 14, driving COIN up 16% same day. This correlation is well-established and causal.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Current price context**: As of Feb 16 close, COIN at $164.32. The Feb 14 rally brought it from ~$140s to ~$164, representing recent positive momentum.
- **Volatility backdrop**: VIX at 20.8 indicates elevated but not extreme volatility. COIN's daily σ of 7-9% means ±10-20% moves over 7 days are routine.
- **Negative 1-month momentum**: Stock still down ~32% from January highs despite recent bounce. Academic evidence suggests this creates slight downward bias.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Analyst price targets**: Wide range ($341 average from Fool, $400 from Citi, $440 from Bernstein). These are long-term targets with poor short-term predictive power.
- **Technical support at $145**: Mentioned in Benzinga article but technical levels have weak predictive validity over 7-day horizons.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: Feb 17 (today) → Feb 27 (resolution) = 10 calendar days, approximately 7 trading sessions.

**Key consideration**: The question asks if Feb 27 close will be higher than Feb 17 close. Since markets are closed today (Presidents Day mentioned in TechStock² article), the effective comparison is likely Feb 18 open/close vs Feb 27 close = 6-7 trading days.

**If timeframe halved (3-4 days)**: Recent momentum from Feb 14 rally would carry more weight. Bitcoin's rebound would be fresher catalyst. Probability would shift toward "Yes" by ~5-7pp to ~50-52%.

**If timeframe doubled (14 days)**: Reversion to mean becomes more likely. The recent 16% pop could fade. Probability would shift toward base rate of 47% or slightly lower to ~42-45%.

## (d) Justification for Inside View Adjustment

**Starting point**: Outside view base rate of 44% (derived from COIN's historical 47% seven-day up-frequency, adjusted -3pp for negative momentum).

**Key factors requiring adjustment:**

1. **Recent positive catalyst (Feb 14)**: The 16% rally on Bitcoin rebound occurred just 3 days before our start date. This creates short-term positive momentum that wasn't captured in the historical base rate calculation. Effect: +3-5pp.

2. **Bitcoin stabilization**: BTC at ~$69,877 is up from recent lows but still down 50% from October peak. The recent bounce suggests short-term stabilization rather than continued freefall. Neutral to slightly positive. Effect: +1-2pp.

3. **Earnings overhang removed**: The Q4 earnings (Feb 13) are now behind us, and the market's reaction was surprisingly positive despite the miss. This removes a major uncertainty. Effect: +2-3pp.

4. **Time decay of momentum**: The Feb 14 rally will be 3-4 days old by Feb 18. Short-term rallies in volatile stocks often see partial retracement within a week. Effect: -2-3pp.

5. **No major catalysts ahead**: No scheduled earnings or major crypto regulatory events in the 7-day window. Status quo continuation becomes more likely. Effect: Neutral.

**Net adjustment**: +3 to +5 percentage points from outside view base of 44%.

The recent rally is the most significant new information not captured in the historical base rate. However, COIN's high volatility (daily σ ~8%) means a 16% move can easily reverse. The question is whether enough momentum persists through Feb 27.

## Probability Calibration

**Base rate**: 44% (from outside view)

**Adjustments**:
- Recent rally momentum: +4pp
- Earnings uncertainty removed: +2pp  
- Time decay of rally: -2pp
- Bitcoin stabilization: +1pp

**Calibrated inside view**: 44% + 4% + 2% - 2% + 1% = 49%

This suggests essentially a coin-flip, which aligns with:
- The stock's inherent high volatility
- Recent positive momentum balanced against longer-term downtrend
- Lack of clear directional catalysts in the forecast window
- Historical symmetry in 7-day outcomes

**Confidence interval** (80%): 40% - 58%

I'm anchoring close to the base rate because while recent news is positive, it's not sufficiently powerful to override COIN's historical volatility and mean-reverting behavior over short horizons.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will COIN's closing price on Feb 27, 2026 exceed its Feb 17, 2026 close of $164.32? 7 trading days.

2. **Base rate**: 44% from historical COIN seven-day outcomes, adjusted for negative momentum.

3. **Consistency**: "49 out of 100 times, COIN closes higher after 7 trading days." Yes, this reflects near-random walk behavior with slight positive bias from recent rally.

4. **Top evidence**:
   - Feb 14 rally: +16% on Bitcoin rebound (factual, verified)
   - Bitcoin at $69,877, up 5% (factual, verified)
   - Q4 earnings miss but positive market reaction (factual, verified)
   - Historical 7-day symmetry ~47% (factual, computed)
   - High volatility σ ~8% daily (factual, established)

5. **Blind spot**: Bitcoin crashes 10-15% in next week due to macro shock (Fed hawkishness, regulatory news, liquidity crisis). This would drag COIN down 15-25% and make my forecast look foolish. Would shift probability to ~25-30%.

6. **Status quo**: Current price $164.32 reflects recent rally stabilization. Status quo = price oscillates ±5-10% around current level with no clear direction. This supports probability near 50%.

Probability: 49%
