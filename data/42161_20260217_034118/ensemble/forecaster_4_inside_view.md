Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance quote page (Feb-14-26): hard data on price 164.32, beta 3.7, analyst target 273.67.  High-quality for prices/consensus; narrative opinions ignored.  
2. Yahoo Finance article “Dear Coinbase Stock Fans…” (Feb-11-26): factual 32 % January drop, Feb-12 earnings date.  Medium quality; author is finance journalist, not an earnings analyst.  
3. Public.com earnings table (Feb-13-26): Q4-25 EPS $0.66 vs est $1.05 (-37 %).  Primary data, high quality.  
4. Decrypt / Benzinga round-ups (Feb-13-26) mentioning a 16 % share pop and Morningstar FV $160.  Medium quality; event already priced in.  
5. TechStock² (Feb-14-26): Bitcoin +5 % → COIN +16 % on Feb-14.  Provides strongest link between BTC and COIN. Medium quality market recap.  
6–10. AskNews crypto miscellany (Feb 15-16-26): token-specific flashes, no direct bearing on Coinbase equity; treated as noise.

(b) Evidence analysis  
• Strong: none.  
• Moderate (+): Bitcoin rebound after benign CPI (TechStock²) and COIN’s 16 % sympathy jump show current BTC/COIN positive correlation likely to persist a few days.  
• Moderate (-): Public.com shows a large negative EPS surprise; post-earnings drift literature (e.g., Bernard & Thomas 1989) indicates mild under-performance in the two weeks following a miss.  
• Weak (+): Morningstar FV ≈ spot gives valuation floor near 160.  
• Weak (-): 16 % surge on Feb-14 may invite short-term mean reversion.

Net evidence roughly balances.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Question window = 8 trading days (Feb-17 close → Feb-27 close).  Halving (4-day horizon) would push probability closer to 50 % because drift matters even less.  Doubling (16 days) would let macro/crypto drift dominate a bit more, nudging probability upward a few points.

(d) Justification / adjustment from outside view  
Outside-view base rate (broad 2-week equity direction for a high-beta stock): 52.4 % “up”.  
Adjustments:  
-2 pp for negative-surprise post-earnings drift.  
+1 pp for concurrent Bitcoin strength and correlation.  
-1 pp for mean-reversion risk after 16 % single-day spike.  
Result ≈ 50 %.

Probability calibration
COIN closes higher on 2026-02-27 than on 2026-02-17 about one time out of two.  My inside-view probability: 50 %.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Between the closes of 17 Feb 26 and 27 Feb 26, will COIN be higher?”  
2. Outside view stated: 52.4 %.  
3. Consistency line – “50 of 100 times, COIN’s 27 Feb close exceeds its 17 Feb close.”  
4. Key evidence: a) -37 % EPS miss; b) 16 % jump tied to BTC rebound; c) high beta/volatility; d) no scheduled catalysts till 27 Feb.  
5. Blind-spot: A sharp BTC rally (>15 %) next week would drag COIN much higher, making 50 % far too low.  
6. Status-quo outcome: roughly coin-flip over an 8-day window; slight tilt to “no change” supports near-50 % forecast.

Probability: 50%
