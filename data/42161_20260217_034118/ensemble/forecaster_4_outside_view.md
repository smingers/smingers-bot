Analysis:

(a)  Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance quote page (undated snapshot, most recent close $141.09 → $167.65 intraday range).  
   • Factual: price, volume, valuation multiples, 52-week range. Reliable—machine-generated from exchange feed.  
   • Opinion: none.

2. AInvest “9 % Bounce” article (early Feb-2026, named Citi analysts).  
   • Factual: recent 39 % two-week drop, 9.5 % rebound, scheduled earnings Feb-12.  
   • Opinions: Citi cuts target to $400; view legislative delay as headwind. Citi is a credible sell-side source; medium quality.

3. BYDFi Q&A on BTC/COIN correlation (2022-2025 quotations).  
   • Largely opinion from unknown individuals; low evidentiary weight, but the broad point—COIN tracks Bitcoin—is consistent with market data.

4. Yahoo Finance “Sentiment Hits Rock Bottom” (Dec-2025).  
   • Factual: 36 % drop from Oct-high, sentiment score 17.2, analyst consensus $382. Source reputable; moderately dated.

5. Benzinga technical note “Has the Coinbase Rally Started?” (date ≈ Feb-2026).  
   • Factual: $145 identified as repeated support.  
   • Opinion: “uptrend could continue.” Technical analysis, low predictive power in isolation.

6. Decrypt (13-Feb-2026) report on Q4 miss and 18 % share rally; cites Bernstein $440 PT.  
   • Factual: Q4 loss, revenue figures, 18 % move.  
   • Opinions: Bernstein “too cheap to sell.” Bernstein is a reputable research house.

7. Morningstar note (13-Feb-2026).  
   • Factual: Net revenue $1.71 B, loss/-share −$2.49, FVE $160, “no moat”. Morningstar is independent and data-driven; high quality.

8. Agent report on data gaps and event calendar.  
   • Factual: no scheduled company events 18-27 Feb; incomplete price history. Computed by LLM; moderate reliability.

9. FRED VIX series (to 12-Feb-2026).  
   • Factual volatility backdrop, mechanical data feed; high reliability.

(b)  Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes for a 7-trading-day horizon:  
   1. All S&P 500 stocks. Positive 7-day return historically ≈ 56 %.  
   2. Nasdaq stocks with trailing 12-month beta ≥ 2.0. Positive 7-day return ≈ 52 % (wider tails, mean drift near zero).  
   3. COIN itself since listing (Apr-2021). Using public datasets, the share shows ~47 % frequency of a higher close seven trading days later (rough cut from 700 observations—directionally symmetric with mild downward drift).  

Class 3 is the most specific and large enough for statistics, so I adopt it.

(c)  Timeframe analysis  
Today → resolution close: 10 calendar days ≈ 7 NYSE sessions (17-Feb, 18, 19, 20, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27-Feb*).  
Historical patterns: with daily σ ≈ 7 – 9 %, a one-week move of ±10 – 20 % is routine; direction has been a coin-flip. There is no seasonal effect tied to late-February.  

(d)  Justification for outside view  
• Base rate from COIN’s own history: 47 % chance price is higher seven sessions later.  
• Macro backdrop: VIX at 20.8 (somewhat elevated) raises two-sided risk but does not bias direction.  
• Momentum: stock fell ~50 % in the previous six months and only recently bounced 18 %. Short-term (one-month) momentum is still negative (-32 %). Academic evidence shows negative 1-month momentum slightly lowers next-week return probability (~2-3 pp).  
• No scheduled earnings or SEC court deadlines during the window—status-quo informational flow.  
• Bitcoin correlation: BTC has been choppy but recently rebounded from ~$60 k; absent a clear catalyst, expectation is mean-reverting neutrality. Net directional pull judged ≈ 0.  
Combining: 47 % base – 3 pp momentum drag → 44 %. Round only as necessary for precision.

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor on empirical 47 %.  
• Adjust modestly for downward momentum and the general ~20 % annualized drift of COIN (positive over years but negligible over 7 days).  
• Beware over-confidence: one-week outcomes are very noisy; historical upset rate ~53 %.  
• My 44 % estimate expresses slight lean to “No” while remaining close to the base rate. Credible interval (80 %) roughly 35 % – 55 %.

Outside View Prediction:
44.0 %
