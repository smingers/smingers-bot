Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance earnings table (Feb-13-2026, factual). Quality: high, gives EPS miss and timing; opinions absent.  
2. Yahoo Finance “Dear Coinbase Fans” (Feb-11-2026, mixture). Factual January draw-down, price ≈$160-165, 50-DMA $169; opinions from unnamed analysts (discarded). Quality: good for raw numbers, weak for opinions.  
3. Fool.com forecast piece (Jan-2026). Gives analyst consensus (19 Buy/10 Hold, $341 PT). Quality: medium, dated five weeks ago.  
4. Benzinga outlook (Jan-2026). Analyst split 13 Buy/10 Hold/2 Sell; notes GENIUS Act, Circle partnership. Quality: medium.  
5. TechStock² roundup (Feb-14-2026). Factual: COIN up 16 % Friday after Bitcoin gained 5 %. Quality: good; very recent.  
6. Morningstar note (Feb-13-2026, pay-walled but quoted): trims fair value to $160, tags “Very-High” uncertainty. Quality: high, identifiable expert.  
7. Assorted AskNews crypto-token items Feb 15-16 2026 – none mention Coinbase; irrelevant → ignored.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong:  
• Post-earnings price reaction +16 % on 14 Feb confirmed by TechStock² and ticker tape – positive post-earnings-announcement drift (PEAD) is a well-documented equity phenomenon.  
Moderate:  
• Bitcoin rebound to ~$70 k (same article) and COIN’s historical β≈3.7 ⇒ logical positive linkage if BTC holds.  
• Analyst balance still skewed bullish (Fool.com, Benzinga).  
Weak:  
• Morningstar FV $160 is 2-3 % below 16 Feb close $164 – 165 (mildly bearish).  
• High short-term volatility (σ≈10 %/day) implies path is noisy.

Net evidence tilt: modestly positive.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Resolution in 8 calendar / ~7 trading days. If horizon were halved to 3-4 days, the PEAD effect would matter more and I would raise probability ~2 pp. If doubled to 14-15 trading days, macro news dominates, Bitcoin uncertainty widens; I would drop probability ~3-4 pp toward 50.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (COIN finishing an 8-day window higher) = 52 %.  
Adjustments:  
+2 pp  Positive PEAD typically adds 0.3–0.5 % abnormal return per day for several days.  
+1 pp  Bitcoin has rebounded, macro data benign; short-run correlation helps.  
–0.5 pp  Stock now trades a few dollars above Morningstar FV; slight valuation overhang.  
Result ≈ 54.5 %, rounded to 55 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that about 55 out of 100 times, COIN will close higher on 27 Feb 2026 than on 17 Feb 2026.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Between the closes of 17 Feb 2026 and 27 Feb 2026, will COIN end up higher?”  
2. Outside-view rate: 52 %.  
3. Consistency: “55 out of 100 times the 27 Feb close exceeds the 17 Feb close” – plausible.  
4. Key evidence (in 20 words each):  
   • 14 Feb post-earnings pop +16 %; PEAD usually sustains short-term momentum.  
   • Bitcoin bounce to $70 k; COIN β>3, correlation strong.  
   • Analyst consensus still broadly bullish despite EPS miss.  
   • Morningstar FV $160 < price → mild downward pull.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden Bitcoin sell-off (Fed hawkish speech, ETF outflows) could drag COIN down >10 % within days.  
6. Status-quo: Drift is weak; mean-reversion and momentum roughly balance, nudging toward 50, hence only small adjustment.

Probability: 55%
