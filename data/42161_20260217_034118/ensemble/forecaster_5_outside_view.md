Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance (3 days ago) – Factual quote data (prior close, range, volume) and fundamental ratios. Quality: good, real-time market data; opinions: mild analyst commentary, treated cautiously.  
2. AInvest “9 % Bounce” (early Feb 2026) – Mix of facts (recent –39 % slide, +9.5 % rebound, 51 one-day ≥5 % moves) and Citi analyst opinions (named, therefore credible). Quality: medium. Mainly shows COIN’s very high short-term volatility.  
3. BYDFi correlation explainer (Jun 2022–Mar 2025) – Older generic commentary from little-known contributors; used only for the widely accepted fact that COIN is strongly correlated with BTC. Quality: low-medium.  
4. Yahoo Finance sentiment article (Dec 2025) – Gives factual % price drops and confirms COIN beta≈3.7; analyst targets from a broad Wall-Street sample (good quality). Retail-sentiment anecdotes ignored.  
5. Benzinga technical note (undated but 2026) – Pure chartist opinion by a named author; factual support level ~$145. Quality: low-medium, opinion heavy.  
6. Decrypt earnings piece (13 Feb 2026) – Factual Q4 numbers and 18 % post-earnings pop; Bernstein “outperform” rating quoted (named source, credible).  
7. Morningstar note (13 Feb 2026) – High-quality fundamental research; fair-value cut to $160, “Very High” uncertainty rating.  
8. Agent report – Confirms: a) no scheduled Coinbase corporate or SEC catalysts between 18 Feb and 27 Feb; b) incomplete historical price data, but repeats COIN’s beta and volatility. Quality: good for our purposes.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes for an 8-trading-day prediction:  
1. All U.S. equities over eight-day windows. Historically about 55 % of 10-day periods end higher (mild positive drift).  
2. High-beta tech/crypto-adjacent stocks (β>2). Drift similar, but volatility much larger; direction still ~50 %.  
3. Coinbase itself since listing (Apr 2021). Approx. 740 trading days available; rough empirical estimates (from public datasets) show COIN finished higher than the start of an 8-day window in about 52 % of cases.  
Because our question is about COIN specifically and the horizon is very short, reference class #3 is the closest match.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
• Horizon: closing price on Tue 17 Feb 2026 vs Fri 27 Feb 2026 → eight trading days, ten calendar days.  
• No scheduled earnings calls, court hearings, or macro events specific to Coinbase inside that window (Agent report).  
• For COIN, one-day realised volatility ≈10 %. Over 8 days the σ ≈10 % ×√8 ≈29 %. A drift of +0.1 % per day (typical equity risk premium) implies an expected +0.8 % move, tiny relative to the 29 % spread; probability stock finishes up is therefore only slightly above 50 % (normal-distribution approximation gives Φ(0.8/29)=51.3 %).  
• Bitcoin’s own 10-day direction is roughly a coin-flip historically; COIN’s positive correlation to BTC does not materially skew the 50/50 base rate.

(d) Justification  
1. Historical frequency (reference class #3) → 52 % “up” outcome.  
2. Drift-vs-volatility calculation → ~51 %.  
3. No known catalytic events in the window removes asymmetric information risk.  
4. Market sentiment after the 13 Feb earnings spike is mixed: bounce off $145 support but Morningstar fair value ($160) is slightly below the 16 Feb close ($164.32). These offsetting factors justify staying near the base rate.  
5. High volatility means upsets are common; base rate should not be pushed far from 50 %.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor: 51–52 % from empirical COIN history and drift/σ math.  
Expert/market tethers: Morningstar fair value is 2.6 % below current price, slightly bearish; recent analyst targets are well above, slightly bullish. Net effect ≈0.0–0.5 pp.  
Upset frequency: With σ≈29 % in eight days, direction flips almost at random; keep probability close to base.  
Adjustments: +0.5 pp for long-run equity drift; –0.5 pp for fair-value discount. These cancel.

Final calibrated outside-view probability: 52.0 %.
