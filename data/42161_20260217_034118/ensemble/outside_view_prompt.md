<Summary source="https://www.ainvest.com/news/coinbase-9-bounce-bitcoin-correlation-main-character-2602/">
# Summary of "Coinbase's 9% Bounce: Is the Bitcoin Correlation the Main Character?"

**Key Facts and Statistics:**

- Coinbase (COIN) shares surged 9.5% following Bitcoin's rebound from $60,000
- Prior to this bounce, COIN experienced a 39% decline over two weeks (13-day losing streak)
- The decline erased approximately $25 billion in market cap
- COIN has experienced 51 moves greater than 5% over the last year
- Stock's 1-day volatility: 10.4%
- Stock's 1-day turnover rate: 4.7%
- Google Trends data shows Coinbase ranking in the 34th percentile for search interest among industry peers
- Bitcoin had fallen to its lowest level since October 2024 before the rebound
- S&P 500 was up 0.9% during the same period

**Named Source Opinions:**

- **Citi analysts**: Cut price target to $400, citing weaker trading volumes, softer institutional activity, and ongoing uncertainty around timing of U.S. crypto legislation as key headwinds
- **Citi**: Reduced Q4 revenue estimate by approximately 10%
- **Citi**: Identifies "progress on CLARITY" (Senate market structure bill) as the key upside catalyst, but expects negotiations to stretch beyond 2026

**Key Events and Context:**

- Q4 earnings report scheduled for February 12
- U.S. crypto regulatory progress on CLARITY bill is a major factor to watch
- Coinbase's CEO has pulled support for a sweeping digital assets bill, indicating a complex regulatory path ahead

**Article's Main Thesis:**

The article argues that Coinbase's rally is primarily driven by Bitcoin's price recovery rather than company-specific catalysts. The low public search interest despite high trading volatility suggests the move is driven by crypto traders and institutional flows rather than retail sentiment. The article characterizes Coinbase as a "leveraged proxy" for Bitcoin's price action, playing a "supporting role" to Bitcoin as the "main character" in the current market narrative.

# Summary of Article: "Coinbase Sentiment Hits Rock Bottom as Bitcoin Correlation Crushes Options Traders"

**Date:** December 12, 2025  
**Source:** Yahoo Finance

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Coinbase stock performance:** Dropped 36% from its late October high of $343.78. Closed at $275.09 on December 10, 2025.
- **Bitcoin performance:** Fell 17.8% from its November peak of $107,482 to around $90,000 (below $91,000 after Fed-driven selloff).
- **Sentiment score:** Coinbase has a sentiment score of just 17.2 out of 100, placing it in the "very bearish" category among retail investors on Reddit.
- **Q3 earnings:** Beat estimates by 27%, delivering $1.50 per share versus $1.18 expected, with a 43.7% profit margin.
- **Stock beta:** COIN has a beta of 3.7, amplifying crypto market swings.
- **Earnings volatility:** Recent quarters have alternated between 240% beats and 87% misses.
- **Comparison to Robinhood:** Robinhood (HOOD) surged 90% over the past six months and 270% in 2025 by diversifying revenue beyond crypto.

## Analyst Opinions (Named/Reliable Sources):

- **Wall Street analysts:** Maintain an average price target of $382 for Coinbase with 18 buy ratings versus just 2 sells, suggesting professional investors see value.

## Retail Trader Opinions (Less Reliable/Anecdotal):

- One trader on r/options reported their LEAP options (long-term calls expiring January 2027) were down over 50% from all-time high, with losses exceeding 50% on long-term calls.
- Retail investor sentiment on Reddit remains "deeply negative."

## Key Themes:

The article identifies three factors driving bearish sentiment:
1. Bitcoin correlation overwhelms fundamentals
2. Earnings volatility makes timing impossible
3. Options holders face magnified losses as extreme volatility crushes time value

The article contrasts Coinbase's Bitcoin-dependent performance with Robinhood's diversified revenue base, which has insulated it from crypto volatility.

## Key Facts and Technical Analysis:

1. **Current Price Movement:** Coinbase shares are moving higher on Friday (article date not specified), having recently reversed after reaching a support level.

- **Morningstar Rating**: ★★★ (3 stars)

## Expert Opinion (Named Source):
**Michael Miller, CFA (Morningstar analyst)**:
- Considers this a weak earnings report, but better than feared
- Lowered fair value estimate for Coinbase
- Believes the company has been "punished too harshly" in response to falling cryptocurrency prices

Query: Provide daily closing prices for Coinbase (COIN) and Bitcoin (BTC-USD) for the past three years through 2026-02-17; compute 10-day rolling returns, their distribution, and COIN-BTC correlation. List scheduled Coinbase events or SEC actions between 2026-02-18 and 2026-02-27.
1. Daily closing-price coverage (2023-02-18 → 2026-02-17)  

   • Coinbase (COIN).  
     – The FinancialContent extract supplies 52 individual closes from 2025-12-02 through 2026-02-13 (FinancialContent).  
     – The yFinance snippet contributes the ten most recent trading days through the market close of 2026-02-13 (yFinance COIN).  
     – Macrotrends confirms that a complete day-by-day history since the 2021 listing exists but does not expose the individual rows we need (Macrotrends).  
     Result: only ±55 daily observations are actually in hand—far short of the ~750 NYSE/Nasdaq trading days required for a three-year span.  

   • Bitcoin (BTC-USD).  
     – FreeCurrencyRates delivers 47 calendar-day closes for Jan-Feb-2026 (Freecurrencyrates).  
     – The yFinance extract supplies ten recent closes ending 2026-02-17 (yFinance BTC-USD).  
     – Statista references a CoinGecko series that would cover August-2020 → 2026-02-05, but the underlying daily values are pay-walled (Statista).  
     Result: fewer than 60 calendar-day closes are directly available—versus the 1 095 days needed for a full three-year window.

   Because both price series are incomplete, none of the requested analytics can yet be produced with statistical integrity:  
   • 10-day rolling returns across the entire 36-month horizon.  
   • Empirical distribution of those returns (mean, median, skewness, kurtosis, tail quantiles, etc.).  
   • Pearson correlation of COIN vs. BTC-USD over the same horizon.

   Additional data needed: the full sequence of daily adjusted close prices for COIN (Nasdaq trading calendar) and daily close prices for BTC-USD (calendar days), each from 2023-02-18 through 2026-02-17.

2. Scheduled Coinbase corporate events or SEC actions, 2026-02-18 → 2026-02-27  

   • MarketScreener lists projected dates for future earnings releases (Q1-2026 on 2026-05-06, Q2-2026 on 2026-07-29, etc.) but shows no company event scheduled between 18-Feb-2026 and 27-Feb-2026 (MarketScreener).  
   • Investor-relations site shows no entries at all for that specific window (Investor.coinbase).  
   • Public reporting on the SEC lawsuit: the latest dated item is that the SEC requested a 28-day pause in February-2026, but no definite hearing or filing deadline is recorded for 18-27 Feb 2026 (Regulatory Review article quoted in earlier results).  

   Conclusion: As of the sources consulted, there are no publicly disclosed Coinbase earnings events, investor-conference appearances, shareholder meetings, product launches, nor any court/SEC deadlines scheduled for the 10-day window 18-Feb-2026 → 27-Feb-2026.  That said, docket activity in the SEC litigation could be added at short notice; a PACER or court-listener check would be needed to rule that out definitively.

3. Remaining information gaps  

   • Complete three-year daily price history for both assets.  
   • Any late-breaking docket entries in SEC v. Coinbase or last-minute company presentations that may be announced closer to the dates in question.

Without closing these gaps, the requested rolling-return distribution, correlation statistics, and an authoritative event calendar cannot be completed.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.
