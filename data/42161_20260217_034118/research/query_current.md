Analysis:
The core of the forecast is whether COIN (Coinbase Global, Inc.) will trade higher ten calendar days from now (close of 2026-02-27) than it does today (close of 2026-02-17).  Drivers likely to move the share price in the next week and a half include:  

• Coinbase’s Q4-2025 earnings release and 2026 guidance (widely expected late-Feb).  
• Spot-Bitcoin ETF inflows/outflows, Bitcoin & Ethereum price swings, and any regulatory headlines that affect U.S. crypto exchanges.  
• Broader market factors (interest-rate expectations, macro data) but those will mostly be reflected through crypto price action.  

Therefore the most useful news is very near-dated articles or commentary about:  
– Coinbase’s imminent earnings date, analyst revisions, or leaked metrics.  
– Recent trading volatility in COIN.  
– Crypto-asset price moves and ETF flow data from mid-February 2026.  
– SEC or Congressional actions specifically targeting exchanges during the next two weeks.
