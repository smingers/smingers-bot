Pippin (PIPPIN) surged 142% in seven days, reaching $0.690, breaking out of a descending broadening wedge pattern with a projected rally of up to 221%\u2014targeting $1.357. The key confirmation level is $0.772 (current all-time high); a decisive close above it would confirm the breakout, while a breakdown below $0.514 could invalidate the bullish setup. Mubarak (MUBARAK) trades at $0.0189, pressing toward the $0.0189 (0.618 Fib) level, with strong buying pressure indicated by an MFI of 64.37. A daily close above $0.0189 could target $0.0210 and $0.0237, but a breakdown below $0.0174 would weaken the bullish structure. Comedian (BAN) rose 30% to $0.0987, breaking above $0.0914 resistance and aiming for the $0.1000 psychological barrier, with a correlation of -0.27 to Bitcoin suggesting independent upside potential. Sustained demand could push BAN toward $0.1094, but a drop below $0.0846 would signal weakening momentum, with $0.0752 as deeper downside support. All three coins carry high volatility and require careful risk management.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 12:40 PM\nSource:[BeInCrypto](https://beincrypto.com/meme-coins-third-week-february-2026/)\n\n**3 Meme Coins to Watch in the Third Week of February 2026**\nIn the third week of February 2026, the meme coin market is experiencing a strong shift in momentum, with several tokens breaking key technical structures and attracting new speculative capital. BeInCrypto analyzed three meme coins that retail investors should monitor: Pippin (PIPPIN), Mubarak (MUBARAK), and Comedian (BAN). PIPPIN surged 142% in seven days, trading at $0.690, breaking a broad downtrend channel\u2014a pattern that typically signals strong volatility if confirmed, with a projected target of 221% and a key resistance at $0.772 (current ATH). A sustained break above $0.772 could confirm a new uptrend, potentially pushing the price toward $1.000 and even $1.357. However, if the price drops, support levels at $0.514 and $0.372 could be tested, invalidating the bullish signal. MUBARAK is trading at $0.0189, approaching the critical 0.618 Fib level ($0.0189), which, if held as support, could lead to targets at $0.0210 (0.786 Fib) and $0.0237 (1.0 Fib). The MFI indicator at 64.37 shows strong buying pressure without overbought conditions. A daily close below $0.0174 would weaken the structure. Comedian (BAN) rose 30% to $0.0987, breaking above the resistance at $0.0914, and is now targeting the psychological level of $0.1000. With a Bitcoin correlation of -0.27, BAN shows slight inverse movement to BTC, offering potential independence during BTC downturns. If demand persists, the next resistance is at $0.1094. However, a drop below $0.0846 would signal weakening momentum, with deeper support at $0.0752 if the uptrend is invalidated.\nOriginal language: vi\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 12:30 PM\nSource:[BeInCrypto - Vietnam](https://vn.beincrypto.com/meme-coins-third-week-february-2026/)\n\n**On Monday 16th of February TRAVA.FINANCE trades 2 percent higher**\nOn Monday, February 16, 2026, TRAVA.FINANCE (TRAVA-USD) rose 2% over a 24-hour period, closing at 05:52 AM Central Europe Time.

This price is notably below its 52-week high of $0.00165399, recorded on October 15, 2025, and above its 52-week low of $0.000120884, observed on August 18, 2025. The asset\u2019s peak in October 2025 likely coincided with heightened investor interest, possibly due to market trends or ecosystem-specific developments, while the low in August 2025 may have been driven by market corrections or broader economic factors. The current price suggests a maturing market, with investors adopting more strategic and discerning approaches. Future performance will be influenced by regulatory developments, technological advancements, and macroeconomic conditions. According to SentimentTrading, stakeholders must remain vigilant and adaptive to navigate the dynamic cryptocurrency landscape effectively.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 14, 2026 09:36 AM\nSource:[SentimentTrading](https://sentiment-trading.com/articles/crypto-pulse-analyzing-the-0.000337929-closing-trend--market-outlook/)\n\n**3 Meme Coins to Watch in the Second Week of February 2026**\nThree meme coins\u2014PIPPIN, BONE, and BANANAS31\u2014are highlighted by BeInCrypto as potential investment opportunities during the second week of February 2026, following a period of market uncertainty. PIPPIN shows signs of a bullish reversal after a sharp correction, with price bouncing from the $0.1565 demand zone and forming a higher low. The MACD histogram has generated a bullish crossover, indicating decreasing selling pressure. Current price is at $0.2592, with a daily close above $0.2671 confirming continuation of the uptrend, potentially reaching $0.3083 and up to $0.3729 if momentum and volume support. The recovery remains valid as long as the daily close stays above $0.1861; a breakdown below $0.1565 would invalidate the bullish scenario. BONE rebounded from a $0.0482 swing low, reaching the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement at $0.0607, with a bullish candle and rising CMF suggesting reduced outflow. Price is now at $0.0685 testing the 38.2% Fib level. A daily close above $0.0685 opens the path to $0.0747 (50%), then $0.0810 (61.8%), and potentially $0.0899. The recovery is valid if the daily close holds above $0.0607; a breakdown below this level would trigger a bearish reversal and drop to $0.0481. BANANAS31 has surged over four days to $0.0043, testing the critical 38.2% Fibonacci resistance. Historically, it has failed to break this level, making this attempt decisive. A breakout above $0.0047 (50% Fib) would confirm bullish momentum, with targets at $0.0051. Failure to break $0.0043 could lead to a correction to $0.0039, and a loss of the 23.6% Fib support would risk a drop to $0.0035, invalidating the recent recovery.

PIPPIN is showing signs of a potential reversal after a sharp decline, with price stabilizing above $0.1565 and forming higher lows; the MACD indicator shows a bullish crossover, suggesting decreasing selling pressure. The current price is around $0.2592, and a daily close above $0.2671 USD would confirm an uptrend, potentially targeting $0.3083 and even $0.3729 if momentum continues. The recovery remains valid as long as the price holds above $0.1861 daily. BONE has stabilized after a steep drop, defending the support at $0.0482 and reclaiming the 23.6% Fibonacci level at $0.0607. The CMF indicator improved to -0.11, signaling reduced capital outflow. At $0.0685, the coin is testing the 38.2% Fibonacci level; a daily close above $0.0685 could lead to targets at $0.0747 (50%), $0.0810 (61.8%), and ultimately $0.0899. The recovery is valid if daily closes stay above $0.0607. BANANAS31 has surged over four days, trading near $0.0043, testing the 38.2% Fibonacci resistance at the same level. A breakout above $0.0047 (50% Fibonacci) would confirm momentum, with targets at $0.0051. The MFI shows strong buying pressure. Failure to break $0.0043 could trigger a drop to $0.0039, and a break below the 23.6% Fibonacci support at $0.0035 would invalidate the recovery and likely send prices back to early February 2026 levels.\nOriginal language: vi\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 02:20 PM\nSource:[BeInCrypto - Vietnam](https://vn.beincrypto.com/meme-coins-to-watch-in-the-second-week-of-february-2026/)\n\n**COIN's Volatile Crypto Journey: 52\u2011Week Fluctuations Reveal Investment Risks**\nCOIN's cryptocurrency performance from January 20, 2025, to January 20, 2026, reveals significant volatility, with a closing price of $0.000604778.
