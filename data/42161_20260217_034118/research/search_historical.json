The low public search interest despite high trading volatility suggests the move is driven by crypto traders and institutional flows rather than retail sentiment. The article characterizes Coinbase as a \"leveraged proxy\" for Bitcoin's price action, playing a \"supporting role\" to Bitcoin as the \"main character\" in the current market narrative.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.bydfi.com/en/questions/is-there-a-correlation-between-the-price-of-bitcoin-and-the-coinbase-stock-price\">\n# Summary of Article\n\n**Source:** BYDFi  \n**Date:** June 28, 2022 (approximately 4 years ago from the question date)  \n**Topic:** Correlation between Bitcoin price and Coinbase (COIN) stock price\n\n## Key Points:\n\n### Expert Opinions on Bitcoin-Coinbase Correlation:\n\n**Opinion 1 (Murdock Rosario, Jan 11, 2023):**\n- Confirms there is a correlation between Bitcoin price and Coinbase stock price\n- Bitcoin's price movements impact overall sentiment and demand for cryptocurrencies\n- Coinbase is directly influenced by Bitcoin trading volume and interest\n- When Bitcoin price rises \u2192 increased trading activity on Coinbase \u2192 can drive up stock price\n- When Bitcoin price drops significantly \u2192 negatively affects cryptocurrency demand \u2192 can impact Coinbase stock price negatively\n\n**Opinion 2 (Joseph Kakonge, Nov 04, 2024):**\n- Bitcoin and Coinbase stock price are \"closely related\"\n- Bitcoin serves as a benchmark for the cryptocurrency market\n- Bitcoin bull runs attract more investors/traders \u2192 increased trading volume on Coinbase \u2192 positive impact on stock price\n- Bitcoin price falls \u2192 decrease in trading volume \u2192 potentially negative impact on Coinbase stock price\n\n**Opinion 3 (Hsin Kuang Chen, Mar 29, 2025):**\n- Confirms correlation exists between Bitcoin and Coinbase stock price\n- More Bitcoin investment \u2192 higher Coinbase trading volume \u2192 higher revenue \u2192 can reflect in stock price\n- **Important caveat:** While correlation exists, Bitcoin and Coinbase stock don't always move in \"perfect sync\"\n- Other influencing factors include: market trends, regulatory developments, and competition\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This article is from a cryptocurrency information platform and presents opinions from named sources, though the credibility and expertise of these specific individuals is not independently verified in the article.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/coinbase-sentiment-hits-rock-bottom-151040234.html\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Coinbase Sentiment Hits Rock Bottom as Bitcoin Correlation Crushes Options Traders\"\n\n**Date:** December 12, 2025  \n**Source:** Yahoo Finance\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- **Coinbase stock performance:** Dropped 36% from its late October high of $343.78.

Daily closing-price coverage (2023-02-18 \u2192 2026-02-17)  \n\n   \u2022 Coinbase (COIN).  \n     \u2013 The FinancialContent extract supplies 52 individual closes from 2025-12-02 through 2026-02-13 (FinancialContent).  \n     \u2013 The yFinance snippet contributes the ten most recent trading days through the market close of 2026-02-13 (yFinance COIN).  \n     \u2013 Macrotrends confirms that a complete day-by-day history since the 2021 listing exists but does not expose the individual rows we need (Macrotrends).  \n     Result: only \u00b155 daily observations are actually in hand\u2014far short of the ~750 NYSE/Nasdaq trading days required for a three-year span.  \n\n   \u2022 Bitcoin (BTC-USD).  \n     \u2013 FreeCurrencyRates delivers 47 calendar-day closes for Jan-Feb-2026 (Freecurrencyrates).  \n     \u2013 The yFinance extract supplies ten recent closes ending 2026-02-17 (yFinance BTC-USD).  \n     \u2013 Statista references a CoinGecko series that would cover August-2020 \u2192 2026-02-05, but the underlying daily values are pay-walled (Statista).  \n     Result: fewer than 60 calendar-day closes are directly available\u2014versus the 1 095 days needed for a full three-year window.\n\n   Because both price series are incomplete, none of the requested analytics can yet be produced with statistical integrity:  \n   \u2022 10-day rolling returns across the entire 36-month horizon.  \n   \u2022 Empirical distribution of those returns (mean, median, skewness, kurtosis, tail quantiles, etc.).  \n   \u2022 Pearson correlation of COIN vs. BTC-USD over the same horizon.\n\n   Additional data needed: the full sequence of daily adjusted close prices for COIN (Nasdaq trading calendar) and daily close prices for BTC-USD (calendar days), each from 2023-02-18 through 2026-02-17.\n\n2. Scheduled Coinbase corporate events or SEC actions, 2026-02-18 \u2192 2026-02-27  \n\n   \u2022 MarketScreener lists projected dates for future earnings releases (Q1-2026 on 2026-05-06, Q2-2026 on 2026-07-29, etc.) but shows no company event scheduled between 18-Feb-2026 and 27-Feb-2026 (MarketScreener).  \n   \u2022 Investor-relations site shows no entries at all for that specific window (Investor.coinbase).  \n   \u2022 Public reporting on the SEC lawsuit: the latest dated item is that the SEC requested a 28-day pause in February-2026, but no definite hearing or filing deadline is recorded for 18-27 Feb 2026 (Regulatory Review article quoted in earlier results).  \n\n   Conclusion: As of the sources consulted, there are no publicly disclosed Coinbase earnings events, investor-conference appearances, shareholder meetings, product launches, nor any court/SEC deadlines scheduled for the 10-day window 18-Feb-2026 \u2192 27-Feb-2026.  That said, docket activity in the SEC litigation could be added at short notice; a PACER or court-listener check would be needed to rule that out definitively.\n\n3. Remaining information gaps  \n\n   \u2022 Complete three-year daily price history for both assets.  \n   \u2022 Any late-breaking docket entries in SEC v. Coinbase or last-minute company presentations that may be announced closer to the dates in question.\n\nWithout closing these gaps, the requested rolling-return distribution, correlation statistics, and an authoritative event calendar cannot be completed.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"VIXCLS\" query=\"VIXCLS\">\nFRED Economic Data: CBOE Volatility Index: VIX\nSeries ID: VIXCLS\nUnits: Index\nFrequency: Daily, Close\nLatest observation: 20.82 (2026-02-12)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=18.94, min=13.47, max=52.33\n- 5-year: mean=19.14, min=11.86, max=52.33\n- 10-year: mean=18.41, min=9.14, max=82.69\n- All-time: mean=19.44, min=9.14, max=82.69 (since 1990-01-02)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: +4.84 (+30.3%)\n- 3-month change: +0.99 (+5.0%)\n- 6-month change: +5.73 (+38.0%)\n- Year-over-year: 20.82 vs 15.89 (+31.0%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily, Close):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-28,16.35\n2026-01-29,16.88\n2026-01-30,17.44\n2026-02-02,16.34\n2026-02-03,18.00\n2026-02-04,18.64\n2026-02-05,21.77\n2026-02-06,17.76\n2026-02-09,17.36\n2026-02-10,17.79\n2026-02-11,17.65\n2026-02-12,20.82\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
