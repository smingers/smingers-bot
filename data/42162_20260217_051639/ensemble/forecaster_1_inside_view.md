**Quality Assessment**: Forbes (Feb 16) and NBC News (Feb 12) provide highest-quality, most recent factual reporting. Spectrum News (Feb 16) confirms Feb 18 closed-door testimony. Political coverage (Feb 16) indicates ongoing controversy momentum.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Feb 18 Congressional testimony confirmed** (NBC, Spectrum, Forbes - multiple independent sources): This is a scheduled, high-profile event occurring during the forecast window. The Feb 10-11 precedent showed similar legal/political events drove searches to 100. **However**, this testimony is closed-door, which may significantly limit immediate public interest compared to public court filings.

- **Current upward momentum** (Outside view data): Feb 17 value = 24, up 33% from Feb 16 (18). This pre-event buildup mirrors patterns before major news events. Multiple sources confirm media coverage is intensifying (political donations story, Forbes comprehensive article both dated Feb 16).

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Media cycle timing**: Feb 18 testimony will generate coverage Feb 17-20, but closed-door nature means no live updates or dramatic revelations during testimony itself. Post-testimony coverage depends on what (if anything) is disclosed publicly.

- **Recent decay pattern**: Values declined from 100→78→58→36→27→21→18 over Feb 10-16, showing strong decay momentum. The Feb 17 uptick to 24 interrupts this but doesn't definitively reverse it.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Political donation stories** (Feb 16): While indicating ongoing controversy, these are secondary stories unlikely to drive major search spikes themselves.

- **OSU Strauss case developments**: Court order for deposition "within 60 days" provides no specific date in forecast window, so unlikely to drive searches Feb 17-22.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 5 days (Feb 17-22, 2026). Resolution compares Feb 22 value to Feb 17 baseline (24).

**Key Event**: Feb 18 Congressional testimony (Day 2 of 5-day window)

**If Timeframe Halved (2.5 days, ending Feb 19-20)**:
- Would increase "Increases" probability significantly (~70%) because Feb 18 event would be more central, and immediate post-testimony coverage would dominate the shorter window.
- Decay pattern would have less time to reassert itself.

**If Timeframe Doubled (10 days, ending Feb 27)**:
- Would increase "Doesn't change" probability (~50-55%) because post-event decay would likely bring values back toward baseline by Feb 27.
- Historical pattern shows spikes decay within 5-7 days.

**Current 5-day window**: Captures Feb 18 event (Day 2) plus 3 days of post-event coverage/decay. This is a critical middle ground where event impact and decay forces compete.

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate Reminder**: 77% no change, 16% increase, 7% decrease (from 90-day random windows)

**Factors Supporting Shift Toward "Increases":**

1. **Scheduled catalyst during window** (Strong): Feb 18 testimony is confirmed and will generate media coverage. The Feb 10-11 precedent (spike to 100) demonstrates Wexner legal/political events can drive massive search interest.

2. **Pre-event momentum** (Moderate): Feb 17 = 24 (up from 18) suggests early buildup. Forbes comprehensive article (Feb 16) and political donation stories indicate intensifying media attention.

3. **Media cycle mechanics** (Moderate): Even closed-door testimony generates pre-event speculation (Feb 17-18), day-of coverage (Feb 18), and post-event analysis (Feb 19-20). This sustained coverage could maintain elevated search interest through Feb 22.

**Factors Limiting Shift:**

1. **Closed-door testimony** (Strong counterweight): Unlike Feb 10 public court filings, Feb 18 testimony won't provide real-time dramatic revelations. This significantly limits spike potential compared to the 100-value precedent.

2. **Strong decay pattern** (Moderate): Values declined 82% from Feb 10 peak (100→18 over 6 days). Even with Feb 18 event, decay forces may dominate by Feb 22.

3. **Magnitude threshold** (Technical): Requires Feb 22 ≥ 28 for "Increases" (16.7% gain from 24). The Feb 17 uptick (33% gain) suggests this is achievable, but closed-door limitation creates uncertainty.

**Critical Assessment**: The base rate (77% no change) applies to *random* windows without scheduled events. This window is *not random* - it contains a confirmed, high-profile event. However, the closed-door nature and strong decay pattern prevent this from being as clear-cut as the Feb 10-11 spike.

**Probability Shift Justification**: Moving from 55% Increases (outside view) to ~45-50% represents appropriate calibration given:
- Closed-door limitation reduces spike magnitude expectations
- Decay pattern remains strong force
- But scheduled event and current momentum justify staying well above base rate (16%)

## Probability Calibration

**Status Quo Continuation**: If current trend (decay interrupted by modest uptick) continues, Feb 22 value would likely be 22-28, straddling the "Doesn't change" threshold.

**Scenario Analysis**:

1. **Feb 18 generates significant coverage** (35% probability): Media focuses on Epstein connections, closed-door creates intrigue, post-testimony leaks or statements drive interest. Feb 22 value: 30-40. **Outcome: Increases**

2. **Feb 18 generates modest coverage, decay resumes** (45% probability): Closed-door limits interest, story is "old news," decay pattern reasserts by Feb 20-22. Feb 22 value: 21-27. **Outcome: Doesn't change**

3. **Feb 18 coverage minimal, strong decay** (15% probability): Testimony yields nothing newsworthy, media moves on, decay accelerates. Feb 22 value: 15-20. **Outcome: Decreases**

4. **Unexpected positive news for Wexner** (5% probability): Testimony clears him, exculpatory information emerges. Initial spike then rapid decay. Feb 22 value: Could be any outcome depending on timing.

**Calibration Considerations**:
- 90% vs 99%: At 90%, I'm saying 9:1 odds against alternatives. Given closed-door uncertainty and competing forces (event vs decay), this seems too confident for any single outcome.
- 45% vs 55%: A 10% shift here reflects whether closed-door limitation or scheduled event dominates. Current evidence suggests roughly balanced forces.
- The Feb 17 uptick to 24 is significant - it shows event anticipation is already building, supporting "Increases" or "Doesn't change" over "Decreases."

**Final Calibration**:
- **Increases**: 45% (down from 55% outside view due to closed-door limitation, but well above 16% base rate due to scheduled event)
- **Doesn't change**: 45% (up from 35% due to strong decay pattern and closed-door limiting spike magnitude)
- **Decreases**: 10% (unchanged, as scheduled event makes continued decay unlikely)

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Google Trends value for "les wexner" on Feb 22 differ from Feb 17 (currently 24) by more than 3 points? Increases if Feb 22 ≥ 28, Doesn't change if 21-27, Decreases if ≤ 20.

2. **Base rate**: 77% no change, 16% increase, 7% decrease. My prediction (45/45/10) shifts significantly from base rate, justified by scheduled Feb 18 Congressional testimony during forecast window - this is not a random window.

3. **Consistency check**: Most likely = Increases OR Doesn't change (tied at 45%); Least likely = Decreases (10%). This makes sense: scheduled event provides upward pressure, but closed-door nature and decay pattern create uncertainty about magnitude, making both modest increase and no-change plausible. Strong decay unlikely given event catalyst.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   - Feb 18 closed-door Congressional testimony confirmed (multiple sources) - creates catalyst but limits magnitude
   - Feb 17 value = 24, up 33% from Feb 16 = 18 - shows pre-event momentum building
   - Feb 10-11 precedent: spike to 100 from similar legal news - demonstrates potential but was public court filing
   - Strong decay pattern: 100→18 over 6 days - shows powerful downward force competing with event

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Feb 18 testimony produces unexpected bombshell that leaks publicly (whistleblower, congressional statement, document release), generating Feb 10-level spike. This would make my 45% "Increases" look too conservative. Alternatively, testimony is complete non-event with zero media pickup, making 10% "Decreases" too low. Adjustment: These scenarios roughly balance out, so maintaining 45/45/10 split.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Current status quo is interrupted decay (was declining, now upticking to 24). Given 5-day window with Day 2 event, status quo continuation suggests values in 21-28 range by Feb 22, which spans "Doesn't change" and low-end "Increases." This supports my 45/45 split between these outcomes.

7. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs, all between 0-100.

Probabilities: [45, 45, 10]
