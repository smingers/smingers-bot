**Agent Report:**
Comprehensive research identifying:
- Feb 18: Congressional deposition (closed session, at Wexner's Ohio residence)
- Feb 19: Wexner Center film screening (cultural event, indirect connection)
- Feb 20: Bath & Body Works dividend record date (tangential)

The agent report is thorough and cross-references multiple sources. Quality appears high with specific dates and venues.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **All 5-day windows in the 90-day Google Trends data:**
   - 77% no change (≤3 points)
   - 16% increase (>3 points)
   - 7% decrease (>3 points)
   - Most suitable baseline but may not capture event-driven spikes

2. **Event-driven spikes in the recent data:**
   - Feb 10: Value jumped to 100 (peak)
   - Feb 11: 78 (major news day - court order)
   - This appears linked to the court order and FBI document revelations
   - Demonstrates capacity for major news events to drive searches

3. **Post-spike decay patterns:**
   - After Feb 10 peak (100), values declined: 78→58→36→27→21→18
   - Then slight uptick to 24 on Feb 17
   - Shows typical decay after news events, but with some volatility

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** Event-driven patterns combined with the base rate, given that Feb 18 Congressional testimony is a scheduled, high-profile event similar to the Feb 10-11 news that drove the recent spike.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 
- Start: Feb 17, 2026 (current value: 24)
- End: Feb 22, 2026 (5-day window)
- Question resolves based on whether Feb 22 value differs from Feb 17 by >3 points

**Historical Patterns:**

The recent 30-day period shows:
- Baseline values: 1-9 (Jan 19 - Feb 9)
- Spike event: Feb 10 (100) - coinciding with FBI document revelations and court proceedings
- Decay pattern: Feb 11-16 (78→58→36→27→21→18)
- Current uptick: Feb 17 (24, up from 18)

**Critical Observation:** The Feb 17 value of 24 represents a 33% increase from Feb 16 (18), suggesting early momentum building toward the Feb 18 Congressional testimony.

**Similar Historical Windows:**
- The only comparable event-driven period in the data is Jan 30 - Feb 11
- Jan 30-31: Values jumped from 2→3→8 as Epstein files were released
- Feb 10-11: Peak at 100, then 78 (major court/FBI news)

## (d) Justification

**Key Factors Supporting "Increases":**

1. **Scheduled High-Profile Event:** Feb 18 Congressional deposition is confirmed, closed-door but will generate substantial media coverage. Similar to how Feb 10-11 court news drove searches to 100.

2. **Pre-Event Momentum:** The Feb 17 value (24) already shows upward movement from Feb 16 (18), suggesting search interest is building ahead of the testimony.

3. **Media Cycle Timing:** Congressional testimony on Feb 18 will likely generate:
   - Pre-event coverage (Feb 17-18 morning)
   - Day-of coverage (Feb 18)
   - Post-event analysis (Feb 19-20)
   - Weekend commentary (Feb 21-22)

4. **Recent Precedent:** The Feb 10 spike to 100 demonstrates that Wexner-related legal/political events can drive massive search interest.

**Factors Supporting "Doesn't Change":**

1. **Decay Pattern:** Values have been declining since Feb 10, and the current uptick to 24 is modest.

2. **Closed Session:** The Congressional deposition is closed-door, which may limit immediate public interest compared to public hearings.

3. **Base Rate:** 77% of 5-day windows show no change >3 points.

**Factors Against "Decreases":**

1. **Scheduled Event:** With a confirmed major event on Feb 18, continued decay seems unlikely.

2. **Low Historical Frequency:** Only 7% of 5-day windows show decreases >3 points.

3. **Current Momentum:** Feb 17 already shows upward movement.

## Outside View Calibration

**Key Calibration Considerations:**

1. **Event-Driven vs. Base Rate:** The base rate (77% no change) applies to random 5-day windows, but this window contains a scheduled, high-profile event. The Feb 10-11 precedent shows such events can dramatically increase searches.

2. **Magnitude Requirements:** The question requires >3 point change. Given Feb 17 = 24:
   - "Increases" needs Feb 22 ≥ 28
   - "Doesn't change" needs Feb 22 between 21-27
   - "Decreases" needs Feb 22 ≤ 20

3. **Decay vs. Event Dynamics:** While the decay pattern suggests continued decline, the Feb 18 event provides a concrete catalyst for renewed interest. The question is whether this event can generate enough searches to overcome or reverse the decay.

4. **Closed-Door Limitation:** Unlike the Feb 10 spike (driven by public court filings and FBI document releases), the Feb 18 testimony is closed-door. This may limit the magnitude of any spike, but media coverage will still occur.

5. **Historical Upset Rate:** In the Google Trends domain, event-driven spikes are common and can override baseline patterns. The Feb 10 spike itself was an "upset" relative to the prior baseline of 1-9.

**Probability Assessment:**

Given:
- Confirmed Feb 18 event (high-profile, media-covered)
- Pre-event momentum (24 on Feb 17, up from 18)
- Recent precedent (Feb 10-11 spike)
- But: Closed-door session may limit magnitude
- And: Decay pattern has been strong

The most likely scenario is a modest increase driven by Feb 18 media coverage, with values potentially reaching 28-35 by Feb 22. However, there's meaningful probability the increase stays within the ±3 threshold or that decay continues if coverage is muted.

Outside View Prediction:

Increases: 55
Doesn't change: 35
Decreases: 10
