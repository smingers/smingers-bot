Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Recent News Sources (Feb 2026):**

1. **Congresswoman Beatty Statement (Feb 13, 2026)**: Official congressional press release. Factual: DOJ released documents concerning Epstein/Wexner; Beatty donated Wexner contributions; House Oversight investigation underway. Opinion: Beatty's call for accountability (attributed source).

2. **NBC News (Feb 12, 2026)**: Major national outlet. Factual: Judge ordered Wexner deposition in OSU/Strauss case within 60 days; 236 plaintiffs; House subpoena for Feb 18. Quotes from named plaintiffs (Snyder-Hill, Di Sabato) are opinions but identifiable.

3. **Spectrum News 1 (Feb 16, 2026)**: Regional outlet. Factual: Wexner mentioned ~200 times in Epstein files; deposition Wednesday (Feb 18); location due to health claims. Expert opinion from Subodh Chandra (named attorney) on legal implications.

4. **WSYX (Nov 20, 2025)**: Local news, 3 months old. Background on OSU/Strauss case; less relevant for immediate prediction window.

5. **Hollywood Reporter (July 26, 2025)**: Entertainment outlet, 7 months old. Background on Epstein documentaries; minimal direct relevance to Feb 17-22 window.

6. **WOSU (Dec 4, 2025)**: Public radio, 2.5 months old. Background on Wexner's OSU connections; historical context but not immediate catalyst.

**AskNews Articles:**

7. **Forbes (Feb 16, 2026)**: Major business outlet. Comprehensive factual summary: Feb 18 House testimony scheduled; FBI documents label Wexner "co-conspirator"; draft letter mentioning "gang stuff for over 15 years"; $200M alleged misappropriation. High-quality, recent, directly relevant.

8. **Yahoo/GOP senators article (Feb 16, 2026)**: Factual: Multiple Ohio politicians donating Wexner contributions; Husted keeping funds; Moreno keeping $3,500. Political responses to controversy.

9. **Other AskNews articles**: Mostly unrelated (Sonic Drive-In, Hong Kong markets, Vienna Christmas markets, etc.) - irrelevant to question.

**Quality Assessment**: The Feb 12-16, 2026 sources are highly credible, recent, and factually grounded. Key facts: (1) Feb 18 House deposition confirmed, (2) Recent DOJ document release, (3) Politicians responding by returning donations, (4) OSU court ruling.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Feb 18 Congressional Deposition (confirmed)**: Multiple independent sources (NBC, Spectrum, Forbes) confirm Wexner testifying Feb 18. This is a major media event occurring within the prediction window (Feb 17-22). Congressional depositions typically generate significant search interest, especially for high-profile figures in scandal contexts. **Direction: Increases**

- **Recent DOJ Document Release (Feb 13)**: Official government documents released just days before prediction window, with Wexner mentioned ~200 times and labeled "co-conspirator." Fresh news catalyst. **Direction: Increases**

- **Political Donation Returns (Feb 16)**: Multiple Ohio politicians publicly returning Wexner donations creates secondary news cycle. This amplifies the story across local/state media. **Direction: Increases**

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **OSU Court Ruling (Feb 12)**: Judge ordering deposition adds legal pressure narrative, though the Feb 18 House testimony is the more immediate catalyst.

- **Historical Pattern**: Current value (24 on Feb 16) is in cooling phase from peak (100 on Feb 10). However, the Feb 18 deposition represents a NEW catalyst, not continuation of old news.

**Weak Evidence:**
- Background articles from 2025 provide context but no predictive power for Feb 17-22 window.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: Feb 17-22, 2026 (5 days)

**Key Event Timing**: Feb 18 (Day 2 of 5) - Congressional deposition

**If Halved (2.5 days, Feb 17-19)**: Would increase probability of "Increases" since the Feb 18 event would dominate a shorter window with less time for post-event cooling.

**If Doubled (10 days, Feb 17-27)**: Would increase probability of "Doesn't change" as post-deposition cooling would likely occur in the latter half, potentially bringing the value back within ±3 of starting point.

**Current Timeframe Impact**: The 5-day window captures the deposition event (Day 2) plus 3 days of potential aftermath. This is optimal timing for observing a search spike.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside View Base Rate**: Increases 17%, Doesn't change 75%, Decreases 8%

**Why Current Circumstances Differ from Reference Class:**

1. **Scheduled Major Media Event**: The Feb 18 congressional deposition is a confirmed, high-profile event within the prediction window. The 90-day historical reference class likely includes mostly "no new news" periods. When major scheduled events occur, they systematically break the status-quo pattern.

2. **Convergence of Multiple Story Lines**: The prediction window uniquely combines:
   - Congressional testimony (Feb 18)
   - Recent DOJ document release (Feb 13)
   - Political donation controversy (Feb 16)
   - OSU court ruling (Feb 12)
   
   This clustering of related news creates sustained media attention, unlike typical five-day windows.

3. **Media Cycle Timing**: Congressional depositions, especially on scandal topics, generate:
   - Pre-event coverage (Feb 17)
   - Event-day coverage (Feb 18)
   - Post-event analysis (Feb 19-20)
   
   This three-phase cycle systematically drives search interest.

4. **Cooling Phase Reversal**: While the current trend is downward from the Feb 10 peak, the Feb 18 deposition represents a NEW catalyst that can reverse cooling trends. Historical data shows spikes can occur even during cooling phases when fresh news breaks.

**Magnitude of Shift Justification**: 
- The Feb 18 deposition is comparable to the Feb 10 event that caused the spike to 100. While unlikely to reach 100 again (diminishing returns on repeat scandal coverage), a move from 24 to >27 (triggering "Increases" resolution) is highly plausible.
- Congressional testimony typically generates more sustained coverage than document releases alone.
- The resolution threshold is only ±3 points, making even moderate media attention sufficient to trigger "Increases."

## Probability Calibration

**Status Quo Continuation**: If nothing happened, the cooling trend would continue, favoring "Decreases" or "Doesn't change." However, the Feb 18 deposition breaks this pattern.

**Calibration Logic**:
- Strong evidence for "Increases": Multiple independent sources confirm Feb 18 event; historical precedent shows congressional testimony drives search interest; convergence of multiple storylines.
- "Doesn't change" requires the Feb 18 deposition to generate minimal additional interest (±3 points), which seems unlikely given media coverage patterns.
- "Decreases" would require the cooling trend to continue despite new catalyst, which contradicts media cycle dynamics.

**Probability Distribution**:
- Increases: 70% (up from 17% base rate due to confirmed major event)
- Doesn't change: 25% (down from 75% due to low probability Feb 18 generates zero additional interest)
- Decreases: 5% (down from 8% as new catalyst makes further decline unlikely)

**Confidence Check**: 70% implies 7:3 odds for increase. Given confirmed congressional testimony within window, this seems appropriately confident without being overconfident. The 25% for "Doesn't change" acknowledges uncertainty in exact magnitude of search response.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Predict if Google Trends value for "les wexner" on Feb 22 will be >3 higher, ±3, or >3 lower than Feb 17 value.

2. **Base rate**: Started at 17/75/8. Final prediction 70/25/5 represents major shift justified by confirmed Feb 18 congressional deposition within prediction window.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely=Increases; Least likely=Decreases. Makes sense given Feb 18 testimony is confirmed major media event.

4. **Key evidence**: (1) Feb 18 congressional deposition confirmed by multiple sources, (2) Recent DOJ documents released Feb 13, (3) Politicians returning donations Feb 16, (4) Congressional testimony historically drives search interest, (5) Only need +3 point move to trigger "Increases."

5. **Blind spot**: Deposition occurs behind closed doors with no public livestream, generating less real-time interest than anticipated. Media coverage focuses on other political events. Would shift probability toward "Doesn't change" (perhaps 40/50/10).

6. **Status quo**: Current cooling trend from Feb 10 peak would favor "Decreases" or "Doesn't change," but Feb 18 deposition is a new catalyst that breaks status quo. Given volatility of scandal-related searches and confirmed major event, shift away from status quo is justified.

7. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [70, 25, 5]
