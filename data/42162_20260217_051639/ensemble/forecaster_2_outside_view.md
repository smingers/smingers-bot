**Agent Report**: Comprehensive synthesis identifying key event on Feb 18 (congressional deposition). High-quality analysis noting concentration of news events. Correctly identifies this as closed-door testimony at Wexner's Ohio residence. Provides context on recent coverage patterns and Google Trends implications.

**Google Trends Data**: Shows dramatic spike on Feb 10 (value=100), followed by decay to 24 on Feb 17. Baseline analysis shows 77% of 5-day windows have ≤3 point changes. Recent 7-day average (37.4) significantly elevated vs prior period (20.7).

(b) Reference class analysis:

**Reference Class 1: General 5-day Google Trends windows for this search term**
- Base rate: 77% no change (≤3 points), 16% increase (>3), 7% decrease (>3)
- Suitability: Good baseline but doesn't account for current elevated state or scheduled events

**Reference Class 2: Post-news-spike decay patterns**
- After Feb 10 spike (100), values decayed: 78→58→36→27→21→18→24
- Pattern shows decay with some volatility
- Suitability: Highly relevant given we're in post-spike period

**Reference Class 3: Google Trends behavior around scheduled high-profile events**
- Feb 18 congressional testimony is confirmed, closed-door but will generate news coverage
- Historical pattern: major Wexner news events (court orders, file releases) generate multi-day elevated search interest
- Suitability: Most relevant for this specific forecast

**Chosen Reference Class**: Combination of Class 2 and 3 - we're in a post-spike decay period BUT have a scheduled major event (Feb 18 testimony) that will likely generate renewed search interest.

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Prediction window**: Feb 17-22 (5 days)
**Current state**: Feb 17 value is 24 (elevated vs 90-day mean of 6.8)
**Key scheduled event**: Feb 18 congressional testimony on Epstein ties

**Historical pattern analysis**:
- Jan 30-31: DOJ file release caused jump from 3→8
- Feb 10-11: Major news cycle (court order + congressional revelations) caused spike to 100, then 78
- Feb 12-17: Decay pattern from 58→24, but with uptick on Feb 17 (18→24)

**Similar 5-day windows with scheduled events**:
The Feb 10-14 period (100→78→58→36→27) showed sustained elevated interest following major news, though declining.

(d) Justification:

The forecast must weigh two competing forces:

**Factors favoring "Increases"**:
1. Confirmed Feb 18 congressional testimony - a major, scheduled news event
2. Current value (24) is already elevated but not at peak
3. Recent uptick from 18→24 on Feb 17 suggests renewed interest
4. National media will cover the testimony even if closed-door
5. Agent report notes reporters will "camp outside" and publish immediate summaries
6. Historical pattern shows Wexner news generates multi-day coverage cycles

**Factors favoring "Doesn't change" or "Decreases"**:
1. We're in established decay pattern from Feb 10 spike
2. Closed-door testimony may generate less immediate search interest than public hearings
3. Base rate shows 77% of 5-day windows have ≤3 point change
4. Value could continue decay trajectory (24→21→18 would be -6, triggering "Decreases")
5. Weekend effect (Feb 21-22) typically shows lower search volumes

**Critical insight**: The Feb 18 testimony represents a concrete, scheduled catalyst. Even closed-door congressional testimony generates substantial press coverage. The Agent report correctly identifies this as the primary driver in the window. However, the question asks about the value on Feb 22 compared to Feb 17, giving 5 days for the news cycle to play out.

Most likely scenario: Feb 18 testimony generates news coverage that elevates search interest on Feb 18-19, potentially pushing the value higher than 24. Even if it decays by Feb 22, the peak during the window matters for the comparison.

Outside view calibration:

**Tethering to established distributions**:
- Base rate: 77% no change, 16% increase, 7% decrease
- However, this base rate includes many "quiet" periods without scheduled events
- When major Wexner news breaks (Feb 10-11), we see sustained multi-day elevation

**Probability of upset/unexpected outcome**:
- In celebrity/political scandal Google Trends, scheduled testimony typically generates predictable search spikes
- Risk of upset: A much bigger news story could overshadow Wexner coverage
- Counter-risk: Testimony could reveal bombshell information, amplifying interest beyond expectations

**Calibration considerations**:
1. The Feb 18 event is confirmed and will generate coverage - this is not speculative
2. Current value (24) provides room for >3 point increase to trigger "Increases" (need ≥28)
3. The decay pattern could continue, but the scheduled catalyst disrupts normal decay
4. Resolution checks the value on Feb 22, allowing time for post-testimony coverage cycle

**Confidence assessment**:
- High confidence (70-80%) that Feb 18 generates some search spike
- Moderate confidence (50-60%) that this spike persists or peaks high enough by Feb 22 to exceed 27 (24+3)
- Lower confidence (20-30%) in continued decay through a major news event

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 60%
Doesn't change: 30%
Decreases: 10%
