Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-22 (US Google Trends, fixed range 2026-01-23 to 2026-02-22), compare “les wexner” values: **Increases** if Feb 22 is >3 higher than Feb 17; **Decreases** if >3 lower; otherwise **Doesn’t change** (±3).

2) (a) Source analysis (what’s new, how good, and what’s signal vs opinion)

- **NBC News (Feb 12, 2026)**: High-quality national reporting. Key facts: federal judge orders Wexner deposition in OSU Strauss civil case within 60 days; also notes House Oversight deposition scheduled Feb 18 re Epstein ties. Mostly factual; quotes from plaintiffs are opinion/advocacy but not predictive.
- **Spectrum News 1 (Feb 16, 2026)**: Solid regional political/legal reporting. Key facts: subpoenaed deposition planned Wednesday (Feb 18), lawmakers traveling to Ohio, Wexner says not well enough to travel. Includes expert commentary (attorney Subodh Chandra) that deposition under oath matters; his expectation of “no DOJ action” is opinion and not directly tied to short-horizon search interest.
- **Forbes (Feb 16, 2026)**: High-reach outlet; fact pattern summary of “Epstein files” mentions and upcoming Feb 18 testimony. Mix of reported document claims and narrative synthesis; still likely to drive public attention. Some claims (e.g., amounts, control details) are reported from documents/secondary accounts; treat as moderately reliable but not all independently verified.
- **Beatty.house.gov statement (Feb 13, 2026)**: Primary-source political statement. Fact: she says DOJ documents released; Oversight investigation underway; she calls for under-oath answers. The *stance* is advocacy, but the existence of public political messaging is a real attention driver.
- **Yahoo news article (Feb 16, 2026)** (syndicated political/local reporting): Plausible, timely. Fact: politicians deciding whether to return Wexner donations amid Epstein probe. This is “second-wave” political fallout coverage—often sustains interest but not always spiky.
- **WOSU / WSYX / WOSU Public Media older pieces (Nov–Dec 2025)**: Reliable local context; mainly background and prior protest activity. Less direct for the specific Feb 17–22 change except as continuing narrative.
- **Outside-view Google Trends pattern noted in the prompt**: Most relevant quantitative evidence: post-spike decay after Feb 10 peak; and a stated base rate that most 5-day windows move ≤3 points (though that base rate is for calmer periods).

3) (b) Evidence analysis (weighted to the resolution criteria: Feb 22 vs Feb 17)

Strong evidence
- **A scheduled, newsworthy event inside the window (Feb 18 House Oversight deposition)** appears across multiple reliable sources (NBC, Spectrum, Forbes, Beatty statement context). Mechanism: fresh headlines → incremental searches for “les wexner.” This increases odds of an upward move relative to Feb 17.

Moderate evidence
- **We appear to be in a post-spike decay regime** (prompt’s described trajectory after Feb 10 = 100). Mechanism: public attention fades quickly after peak unless new revelations occur. This increases odds Feb 22 < Feb 17.
- **The Feb 18 testimony is reportedly closed-door / limited transparency** (Spectrum). Mechanism: fewer “viral” clips/transcripts → smaller and shorter search bump; also increases odds any bump dissipates by Feb 22.

Weak evidence
- **Donation-return political mini-stories (Yahoo)** can sustain low-level interest, but often don’t create large day-5 net changes (they may spike briefly then normalize).
- **Weekend effects** (Feb 22 is a Sunday) plausibly depress interest vs weekday; however Google Trends is normalized and the ±3 band is wide enough that weekend alone may not decide it.

Net: evidence is genuinely mixed: a real catalyst (push up) versus an established decay trend + closed-door format + Sunday timing (push down or neutral).

4) (c) Timeframe analysis
- Forecast window is **5 days** (Feb 17 → Feb 22).
- If the timeframe were **halved (to ~2–3 days)**, I’d raise **Increases** because the Feb 18 event would be closer to the endpoint and any spike would be less likely to have faded.
- If the timeframe were **doubled (to ~10 days)**, I’d raise **Decreases/Doesn’t change** because scandal attention typically mean-reverts absent major new disclosures.

5) (d) Justification: updating from outside view to inside view
Outside view given: **Increases 60 / Doesn’t change 30 / Decreases 10**. That outside view seems to overweight “there will be a spike at some point” rather than the actual criterion, which is specifically **Feb 22 vs Feb 17**.

Key inside-view adjustment: even if Feb 18 produces a bump on Feb 18–19, the resolution depends on whether that bump **persists through Feb 22** (Sunday), or whether attention decays back to/below the Feb 17 level. The closed-door nature makes a “brief spike then fade” more likely than a sustained multi-day elevation.

So relative to the outside view, I shift probability mass:
- away from **Increases** (because endpoint is 4 days after the event, not during it),
- toward **Doesn’t change** (±3 band is large; many outcomes land there),
- and meaningfully toward **Decreases** (status-quo decay + weekend endpoint).

Probability calibration
- Status quo if nothing new: continued decay from the earlier peak suggests **Decreases** becomes quite plausible.
- But “nothing new” is false: Feb 18 testimony is a real catalyst, so **Increases** remains the modal single outcome, just not as dominant as the outside view suggested.
- Final inside-view distribution (sensitivity): a ±10 shift would correspond to (i) whether credible leaks/bombshell headlines emerge from the deposition (push +10 toward Increases), or (ii) the testimony yields no public details and the story is crowded out by other national news (push +10 toward Decreases/Doesn’t change).

Checklist:
1. Criteria/options check: Compare Feb 22 vs Feb 17 value on fixed-date Trends URL; >+3 Increase, within ±3 No change, <-3 Decrease. (Aligned.)
2. Outside-view base rate used: [60, 30, 10]. (I update from it, not ignore it.)
3. Consistency check: Most likely = Increases; Least likely = Decreases; yes—catalyst exists but endpoint timing raises fade risk.
4. Key evidence (most significant):
   - Feb 18 House Oversight deposition (multi-source) likely drives searches upward.
   - Prior spike appears to be decaying; absent sustained new info, interest drifts down.
   - Closed-door format reduces magnitude/duration of attention.
   - Endpoint is Sunday Feb 22, increasing chance interest is lower than midweek.
5. Blind spot: If major leaked testimony details or new DOJ/committee action drops on/near Feb 21–22, I’d be underweighting Increases.
6. Status quo: decay/mean reversion is common; I nudged toward Doesn’t change/Decreases accordingly.
7. Technicalities: probabilities are 0–100 integers summing to 100.

Probabilities: [43, 34, 23]
