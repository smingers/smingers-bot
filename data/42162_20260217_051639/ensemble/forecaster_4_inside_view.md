Analysis
(a) Source analysis  
1. NBC News (12 Feb 2026) – National, high-quality. Factual report that a federal judge ordered Wexner to testify in the Ohio-State Strauss case and that the U.S. House Oversight Committee subpoenaed him for 18 Feb 2026. Clear separation of facts and quotes.  
2. Spectrum News 1 (16 Feb 2026) – Regional cable outlet. Confirms 18 Feb closed-door congressional deposition; explains why it will occur in Ohio. Reliable, single named legal expert.  
3. Rep. Joyce Beatty press release (13 Feb 2026) – Primary source; confirms DOJ document dump naming Wexner and pledges further inquiry. Factual about congressional activity; opinionated language ignored.  
4. Yahoo re-print (16 Feb 2026) – Aggregated local reporting on politicians returning Wexner donations. Moderate reliability, no material errors spotted. Indicates continuing political/media focus.  
5. Forbes (16 Feb 2026) – Business magazine. Long feature recapping Epstein files; reiterates 18 Feb testimony date. Some anecdote, but core calendar facts verifiable.  
6. Google-Trends snapshot supplied in the prompt – Direct quantitative data; most relevant. Current US 30-day value for 16 Feb = 19, recent spike 10 Feb = 100.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Multiple independent outlets (NBC, Spectrum, Forbes, Congresswoman Beatty) all confirm a high-profile congressional deposition on 18 Feb.  → Likely uptick in press coverage/searches.  
Moderate evidence  
• Prior 100-point spike on 10 Feb shows term can rise sharply when fresh documents emerge.  → Demonstrates volatility.  
• Weekend/​Sunday (22 Feb) sometimes dampens search volumes.  → Could blunt any spike.  
Weak evidence  
• Ongoing political donation stories (Yahoo) keep background noise alive but rarely drive large spikes alone.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution window = 5 full days (17 → 22 Feb 2026).  
If window were halved to ~2.5 days, I would raise “Increases” another ~4 pp because decay would have less time to set in.  
If doubled to 10 days, I would raise “Decreases” ~6 pp because post-spike fade would dominate.  

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Base rate from last 90 days (5-day endpoints):  
Increases 16 % / No-change 77 % / Decreases 7 %  
Adjustments:  
1. Catalytic event (18 Feb testimony) within window – strong, pushes toward “Increases”. (+10 pp)  
2. Currently in post-spike decay; today’s value (19) is already far below peak. Sustained level >22 on 22 Feb requires that testimony coverage stay hot through the weekend. Decay pattern after 10 Feb peaked suggests rapid fall-off. (–6 pp from “Increases”, +6 pp split between “No change” and “Decreases”)  
3. Sunday endpoint bias – modest downward tug. (+3 pp to “Decreases”)  
Net inside-view distribution:  

Increases 27  
Doesn’t change 48  
Decreases 25

Forecasting checklist  
1. Option paraphrase: Compare US Google-Trends value for “les wexner” on 22 Feb 2026 with 17 Feb: >+3 ⇒ Increases, within ±3 ⇒ No change, <–3 ⇒ Decreases.  
2. Outside view: 17 / 58 / 25 (see earlier).  
3. Consistency check: Most likely = No change; least likely tied = Increases/Decreases?  (No, Decreases slightly less than Increases in my final numbers). Aligned with reasoning.  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each)  
   • 18 Feb closed-door House deposition guarantees fresh headlines.  
   • Recent 100-point spike proves high elasticity of searches.  
   • Current value already low; past spikes faded within 5-6 days.  
   • Endpoint is Sunday, historically softer search traffic.  
5. Blind-spot: Testimony video/​leak on 21 Feb could keep searches abnormally high through 22 Feb, making “Increases” dominant.  
6. Status-quo bias: 48 % “No change” reflects natural regression to baseline plus short window.  
7. Technicalities: Probabilities sum to 100, numeric, no % signs.

Probabilities: [27, 48, 25]
