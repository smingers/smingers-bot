You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “les wexner” change between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-22 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “les wexner” at the time of writing this question (Feb 16, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 19; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=les%20wexner&date=2026-01-17%202026-02-16).

The options are: ['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves “Doesn't change” if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=les%20wexner&date=2026-01-23%202026-02-22](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=les%20wexner&date=2026-01-23%202026-02-22) for 2026-02-22 is within 3 of the value at 2026-02-17. It resolves “Increases” if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves “Decreases” if the value is more than 3 lower.

# Summary of Article: "Les Wexner Must Sit for Deposition in Ohio State Sex Abuse Suits"

**Source:** Sportico.com  
**Date:** February 11, 2026  
**Author:** Daniel Libit

## Key Facts and Developments:

1. **Court Ruling:** A federal court ordered billionaire Les Wexner to sit for a deposition in three lawsuits against Ohio State University related to sexual abuse committed by former OSU sports medicine physician Richard Strauss. The ruling was issued Wednesday by U.S. District Court Judge Michael H. Watson and U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Preston Deavers.

2. **Wexner's OSU Connection:** Wexner has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to OSU and served on the school's board of trustees during a period when Strauss was under internal investigation and when his full-time employment positions were terminated. Strauss continued as faculty emeritus until his death by suicide in 2005.

3. **Court's Rationale:** The judges stated that Wexner's testimony is relevant because of "the timing and length of Mr. Wexner's tenure on the OSU board of trustees, including his time as vice chairman and chairman of the full board, as well as ranking positions on the board's Personnel Committee." Plaintiffs seek to discover what Wexner knew about Dr. Strauss and when he knew it.

4. **Wexner's Position:** Wexner has maintained he never communicated with or about Strauss and was unaware of any allegations during his board tenure. The judges noted that if true, "this would be evidence of OSU's deliberate indifference."

5. **Timeline:** Wexner must appear for a deposition within 60 days of the order.

6. **Legal Maneuvering:** For months, Wexner and his attorneys refused to accept the subpoena, later arguing his testimony was sought for an "improper publicity-generating purpose." The court rejected both his motion to quash the subpoena and his request for a protective order.

7. **Legal Representation:** Wexner has been represented by a Columbus-based law firm whose managing partner, John Zeiger, currently serves as chair of OSU's board of trustees.

8. **Epstein Connection:** The article notes Wexner faces "increasing international scrutiny" over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, who served as Wexner's financial advisor. This week, the Department of Justice unredacted a 2019 FBI document labeling Wexner as a co-conspirator of Epstein's at Congress' insistence. Wexner has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein.

9. **Name Removal Efforts:** An Ohio State committee is reviewing a second formal request to remove Wexner's name from multiple campus buildings, including the football team's practice facility. The school denied an initial request last month from Stephen Snyder-Hill, a lead plaintiff who was among the first to raise concerns about Strauss in the mid-1990s.

## Statements:

**From plaintiffs' attorneys (Sarah Bradshaw and Joe Sauder):** "This ruling represents another important step toward transparency and accountability."

**Wexner spokesperson and Ohio State:** Did not immediately respond to requests for comment or declined to comment.

# Summary of Article: Judge orders Les Wexner to testify in lawsuit against Ohio State over Richard Strauss' sexual abuse

**Source:** WYSO  
**Date:** February 11, 2026

## Key Facts:

1. **Court Order:** U.S. District Court Judge Michael Watson denied a motion to quash a subpoena on Wednesday, ordering Ohio billionaire Les Wexner to testify in a lawsuit against Ohio State University related to sexual abuse by former team doctor Richard Strauss.

2. **Strauss Abuse Timeline:** Richard Strauss sexually abused hundreds of students while working at Ohio State between the 1970s and 1998.

3. **Wexner's OSU Role:** Wexner's time as a member and chair of Ohio State's board of trustees overlapped with Strauss' employment period.

4. **Lawsuit Status:** Ohio State has settled with approximately half of the plaintiffs, but many are still suing the university.

5. **Testimony Purpose:** According to Judge Watson's ruling, plaintiffs are entitled to discover what Wexner knew about Dr. Strauss and when he knew it. The testimony may illuminate:
   - What the board did to monitor OSU's sexual harassment compliance
   - Whether Wexner or the board had knowledge about allegations surrounding Dr. Strauss
   - Potential evidence of OSU's deliberate indifference to allegations raised against Dr. Strauss as early as 1979

6. **Deposition Timeline:** Watson ordered Wexner to sit for a deposition within the next 60 days.

7. **Congressional Testimony:** Wexner is also facing a deposition before the U.S. House of Representatives on February 18 about his close ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Wexner did not fight this subpoena and said he would fully cooperate with Congress' inquiry.

8. **Third Connection:** Wexner is linked to a third high-profile sexual abuse case involving former Abercrombie and Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries (who was hired by Wexner), who faces sex trafficking and interstate prostitution charges.

4. **Subpoena Process:** Survivors attempted to serve Wexner with a subpoena since September 2025. They held protests at the end of 2025, alleging Wexner's security and lawyer thwarted process servers. U.S. District Judge Michael H. Watson intervened in January 2026 to serve Wexner through alternative means. Wexner's lawyers filed a motion to quash the subpoena, which was denied on Tuesday.

5. **Judge's Rationale:** Judge Watson stated: "Plaintiffs are entitled to discover what Mr. Wexner knew about Dr. Strauss and when he knew it."

8. **Epstein Connection:** Wexner's name appears in the Epstein files and he was once labeled an Epstein co-conspirator by the FBI according to a 2019 document. Epstein was Wexner's primary money manager and investor. Wexner claims he cut ties with Epstein after abuse allegations emerged and that a U.S. Attorney told his counsel in 2019 that he was neither a co-conspirator nor target.

9. **Survivor Reactions:** 
   - Steve Snyder-Hill (former OSU student and plaintiff): "I am happy that billionaires cannot buy their way out of the justice system"
   - Mike Di Sabato (former OSU wrestler and Strauss accuser): The ruling "reinforces that no individual is above the search for truth and accountability"

10. **Background:** Wexner founded L Brands, which included Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works.

   - Wexner claimed Epstein stole or misappropriated several hundred million dollars from him
   - Their financial relationship ended in 2007

4. **Wexner's Legal Representative's Statement:** The Assistant U.S. Attorney told Wexner's legal counsel in 2019 that Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target. Wexner cooperated fully and was never contacted again.

5. **Redaction Issue:**

7. **Background on Wexner:**
   - Ohio's wealthiest person with multi-billion dollar net worth
   - Founded L Brands (includes Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works)
   - Employed Epstein as a financial advisor before severing ties
   - Epstein is believed to have acquired much of his fortune through Wexner, including the Manhattan mansion where Epstein allegedly committed sexual assaults

Query: Identify any scheduled court dates, documentary premieres, corporate announcements, or foundation events involving Les Wexner set for 17-22 Feb 2026; summarize relevant articles published since 1 Jan 2026.
Below is a consolidated picture of every specific event, appearance or announcement linked in any way to Les Wexner that is scheduled between 17 and 22 February 2026, followed by a synopsis of the main press coverage about him published since 1 January 2026.

A. Calendar of known forward-looking events (17-22 Feb 2026)

1. 18 Feb 2026 – Congressional deposition on Epstein ties  
   • The U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will take sworn testimony from Les Wexner on 18 February.  
   • Location: Wexner’s residence in New Albany, Ohio (the venue was moved from the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C.).  
   • The session will be closed to the public; a transcript may or may not be released later, according to committee staff. (WOSU, 11 Feb 2026; Columbus Dispatch, 11 Feb 2026; AOL, 16 Feb 2026; Cleveland Jewish News, 11 Feb 2026)

2. 19 Feb 2026 – Public programme at the Wexner Center for the Arts  
   • “Ohio Goes to the Movies” film screening of The Male Animal (1942) plus the short The Unicorn in the Garden (1953).  
   • Although curated by the Wexner Center rather than Les Wexner personally, the brand name is likely to appear prominently in local listings and social media. (Thurber House spring events page, 19 Feb 2026)

3. 20 Feb 2026 – Record date for Bath & Body Works quarterly dividend  
   • The company Wexner founded (formerly the flagship of L Brands) set 20 February as the shareholder-of-record date for its US$0.20 dividend payable 6 March.  
   • While Wexner no longer holds an executive role, he is still one of the best-known individual shareholders, so the announcement may draw ancillary searches for his name. (SimplyWallSt, 16 Feb 2026)

No court hearings, documentary premieres or Wexner Foundation gatherings fall inside the 17-22 February window. The federal judge’s order that Wexner give a deposition in the Ohio State–Richard Strauss civil litigation requires him to appear “within 60 days” of 11 February, but no date has yet been fixed (WOSU, 11 Feb 2026; Columbus Dispatch, 11 Feb 2026). Likewise, the Wexner Foundation’s next publicly posted meeting is on 6 May 2026.

B. Press coverage since 1 January 2026 – themes and highlights

1. Epstein files and congressional pressure  
   • The Department of Justice’s 30 January mass release of more than 3 million pages of “Epstein files” put Wexner’s name back into headlines; several internal FBI memoranda now label him an “unindicted co-conspirator”, though prosecutors note “limited evidence” (Cleveland Jewish News, 11 Feb 2026; CNN Politics, 10 Feb 2026).  
   • Bipartisan sponsors of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, Reps. Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie, reviewed unredacted versions at DOJ on 10 Feb and then revealed in floor speeches that Wexner was one of six names that had been hidden (Guardian, 13 Feb 2026; Al Jazeera, 11 Feb 2026).  
   • These revelations triggered the 18 Feb deposition subpoena and a fresh round of stories exploring Wexner’s 1986-2007 financial relationship with Epstein, including a newly disclosed 2008 settlement in which Epstein repaid the Wexners US$100 million (AOL, 16 Feb 2026).

2. Court-ordered deposition in Ohio State sexual-abuse lawsuit  
   • On 11 February U.S. District Judge Michael Watson denied Wexner’s motion to quash a subpoena and ordered him to be deposed within 60 days in the Richard Strauss survivor suits against Ohio State University, where Wexner chaired the Board of Trustees during part of the Strauss era (WOSU, 11 Feb 2026; Columbus Dispatch, 11 Feb 2026).  
   • The ruling cites plaintiffs’ right to learn what Wexner “knew and when he knew it” about abuse allegations. This creates a second high-profile deposition in the same timeframe as the congressional testimony and keeps the story prominent.

3. Political money blow-back  
   • Following the unredacted file releases, elected officials in Ohio from both parties announced they will donate prior campaign contributions from Les or Abigail Wexner to charity. Named recipients of Wexner money who are returning or reallocating funds include U.S. Reps. Joyce Beatty and Mike Carey, State Senators Beth Liston and Michele Reynolds, and several Columbus-area local officials (WOSU, 16 Feb 2026).  
   • The cross-party nature of the refunds underscores that the Epstein connection rather than partisan conflict is driving the negative attention.

4. Foundation and cultural activities  
   • Apart from routine council calls (last held 5 Feb 2026), the Wexner Foundation has not announced any special events in February; its next public calendar item is the Q2 Alumni Council call on 6 May 2026 (Wexner Foundation site, accessed 16 Feb 2026).  
   • Cultural references to the Wexner name—such as the 19 Feb film screening at the Wexner Center—continue but with no direct involvement by Les Wexner.

5. Corporate context  
   • Bath & Body Works, now fully separate from former parent L Brands, remains a lightning rod for any Wexner-related news even though he stepped down from all corporate roles in 2020. The company’s 6 March dividend and an expanded Disney Princess product line were announced in early February (SimplyWallSt, 16 Feb 2026).  
   • Financial media link such announcements to Wexner in historical background pieces but they do not list him as a current decision-maker.

C. Implications for Google-Trends “interest over time”

The concentration of two marquee events—Wexner’s closed-door congressional deposition on 18 Feb and the Wexner Center film programme on 19 Feb—right in the middle of the 17-22 February measurement window gives analysts a concrete basis to expect a spike in search activity:

• The 18 Feb deposition is news-worthy, politically charged, linked to the high-profile Epstein saga, and certain to be covered by national outlets even if no video is released. Prior episodes (e.g., the DOJ file drop on 30 Jan and the unredaction fight on 10-13 Feb) generated multi-day clusters of articles across CNN, Guardian, Al Jazeera and local Ohio media, each time lifting “Les Wexner” mentions.

• Even though the hearing is closed, reporters will likely camp outside the New Albany estate and immediately publish summaries and reaction quotes, generating another round of stories over the 18-19 Feb news cycle.

• The 19 Feb cultural event at the Wexner Center is unlikely by itself to move national search traffic, but local press and social calendaring sites will push listings that include his full name and may keep the term afloat in Ohio-based searches.

No offsetting negative catalyst (such as a quiet period or holiday) falls inside the same span. The subsequent weekend (21-22 Feb) may feature follow-up analyses of any deposition leaks or political commentary.

Therefore, there is a plausible case that Google-Trends interest in “les wexner” will be higher on or shortly after 18 February than on 17 February, satisfying the “Increases” resolution condition, unless actual coverage is muted or overshadowed by a larger national story.

D. Information gaps

• Exact time of day and duration of the 18 Feb deposition remain undisclosed; if a transcript release date is set, that could further affect search behaviour.  
• The Ohio State Strauss deposition still lacks a firm date; if it is set for 21-22 Feb the forecast could strengthen.  
• No evidence surfaced of any documentary or TV premiere featuring Wexner in the target window; continued monitoring of streaming-platform schedules would confirm none is planned.

Overall, the only firmly scheduled Wexner-specific event between 17 and 22 February 2026 is his congressional deposition on 18 February, supported by substantial surrounding news coverage that has already begun and is likely to escalate through the window.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
