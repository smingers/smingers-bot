Disagreement Analysis:

**Disagreement 1: Impact magnitude of the Feb 18 congressional testimony on search interest**
- Forecasters 1 and 2 assign high probability to "Increases" (45% and 70% respectively), believing the Feb 18 testimony will generate sufficient sustained search interest through Feb 22.
- Forecasters 4 and 5 assign much lower probability to "Increases" (27% and 20%), believing the testimony's impact will fade quickly, especially given the closed-door nature and weekend endpoint.
- Forecaster 3 is in the middle at 43%.
- This is the single largest source of disagreement, responsible for the spread between 20-70% on "Increases."

**Disagreement 2: Strength of post-spike decay dynamics and whether the starting value (Feb 17) is already elevated or at baseline**
- Forecasters 4 and 5 emphasize that the current value (~19-24) is in an active decay phase from the Feb 10 spike, and that decay will continue, making "Decreases" quite plausible (25% and 38%).
- Forecasters 1 and 2 see the current value as relatively low/baseline already, leaving less room for further decline (10% and 5% for Decreases).
- This disagreement drives the spread on "Decreases" from 5% to 38%.

**Disagreement 3: Whether the Feb 18 testimony is open/public or closed-door, and what media coverage it will generate**
- All forecasters acknowledge it's closed-door, but they differ on how much this limits search interest. Forecaster 2 treats it as a "major media event" regardless, while Forecasters 3, 4, and 5 argue the closed-door format significantly dampens public interest and search volume.

Root Causes:

1. **Impact of testimony** — Primarily different weighting of the same evidence. All know about the testimony; they disagree on how much closed-door testimony drives sustained search interest over 4+ days. Partially factual: whether any testimony details/transcripts are expected to be released publicly could be verified.

2. **Decay dynamics** — Different base rate assumptions and different interpretations of what the Feb 17 starting value represents. Some treat ~24 as still elevated (room to fall), others as near-baseline (limited downside). This is partly factual (what is the typical baseline for "les wexner"?) and partly judgment.

3. **Testimony format and media coverage** — Partially factual. Whether the House Oversight Committee plans to release transcripts, hold a press conference, or keep everything sealed is verifiable and would significantly affect predictions.
