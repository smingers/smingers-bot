Resolution of Disagreements:

**Disagreement 1: Impact magnitude of Feb 18 testimony on search interest**

The research confirms:
- The deposition is definitively scheduled for Feb 18, 2026, closed-door, at Wexner's mansion in New Albany, Ohio
- A transcript will be released "at a later date" with no timetable announced
- No press conference has been announced
- No commitment to release transcript on or shortly after Feb 18

This supports the more conservative forecasters (3, 4, 5). The closed-door nature with no planned immediate public release of transcripts or press conference means the media cycle will likely be: "Wexner deposed today" headlines on Feb 18, possibly some speculation about what was discussed, but no bombshell revelations emerging publicly during the forecast window. This limits the sustained search interest.

**Disagreement 2: Decay dynamics and baseline**

The research clearly resolves this. The agent report provides precise data:
- Typical baseline for "les wexner" is 2-5 (modal 3-4)
- Feb 10: 100 → Feb 11: 44 → Feb 12: 26 → Feb 13: 18 → Feb 14: 15 → Feb 15: 17 → Feb 16: 19

The current value of ~19 on Feb 16 is still significantly elevated above the 3-4 baseline. This means there IS room for further decay. The Feb 17 starting value is likely in the 19-24 range (still elevated). By Feb 22 (Saturday), without sustained new information, continued decay toward baseline (3-4) is quite plausible. This supports forecasters 4 and 5 who argued decay dynamics make "Decreases" a real possibility.

**Disagreement 3: Testimony format and media coverage**

Resolved clearly: closed-door, no transcript release planned, no press conference. This supports the conservative view that the testimony will generate a one-day media mention but not sustained multi-day coverage.

Updated Analysis:

The key dynamics for Feb 17-22:
1. **Feb 17 starting value**: Likely ~19-24 (still elevated from Feb 10 spike, with slight pre-testimony uptick)
2. **Feb 18 (deposition day)**: Will generate headlines. Search interest likely spikes modestly - but this is a closed-door event with no live coverage, so the spike is probably moderate (maybe 25-40 range given the relative scaling)
3. **Feb 19-22**: Post-deposition, with no transcript release or press conference, interest likely decays. By Saturday Feb 22, we're 4 days post-event with no new public information.

The critical question: Will Feb 22 be more than 3 points above or below Feb 17?

Scenario analysis:
- If Feb 17 ≈ 22 and Feb 18 spikes to ~35, then Feb 19 ≈ 25, Feb 20 ≈ 20, Feb 21 ≈ 16, Feb 22 ≈ 13 → This would be "Decreases" (22 → 13)
- If Feb 17 ≈ 22 and Feb 18 spikes to ~30, then decay brings Feb 22 to ~15-18 → "Decreases"
- If Feb 17 ≈ 24 and the testimony generates sustained interest, Feb 22 ≈ 20-22 → "Doesn't change"
- If testimony produces unexpected leak/bombshell, Feb 22 could be elevated → "Increases"

The decay pattern from the Feb 10 spike (halving every ~1.5 days initially, then stabilizing) combined with the closed-door nature of the testimony and weekend endpoint strongly suggests that by Feb 22, interest will have decayed below the Feb 17 level. The Feb 18 testimony creates a brief bump but doesn't sustain through to Saturday.

However, the ±3 threshold for "Doesn't change" is important. If both Feb 17 and Feb 22 are in the mid-to-high teens (say both around 17-20), the difference could easily be within 3 points.

Given the resolved evidence:
- "Increases" should be lower than the weighted average suggests - the closed-door format with no transcript release makes sustained elevation unlikely
- "Decreases" should be somewhat higher - decay dynamics are real and the endpoint is a Saturday
- "Doesn't change" remains plausible if both values settle in a similar range

I'm adjusting toward the more conservative forecasters, but not fully to their positions since the testimony does create genuine media interest.

Confidence: MEDIUM
