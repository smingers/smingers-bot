- On what the deposition means: "Because someone is being deposed, it does not mean that they are a target. It does not mean that they have done anything wrong"
- On the location accommodation: "It's an indication to me that they are not looking at him as a bad actor in the process, but that's someone who knows information and they want his cooperation to get it"
- On congressional authority: Congress has the power to conduct such investigations as affirmed by the U.S. Supreme Court, particularly when there's an egregious breach of law

## Additional Context:

# Summary of Article: "Bondi sidesteps Epstein questions in tense Judiciary Committee hearing"

**Source:** PBS News  
**Date:** February 11, 2026

   - Lawmakers questioned why some names, specifically retail CEO Les Wexner, were selectively redacted in incriminating documents
   - Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) stated that within 40 minutes of him "catching [the DOJ] red-handed," Wexner's name was added back into documents
   - Bondi defended this by noting there was "one redaction out over 4,700" and that Wexner is "listed as a co-conspirator"

4. **Poorly Redacted Files:** Lawmakers accused the DOJ of releasing poorly redacted Epstein files that endangered survivors

5. **Lack of Answers:** The hearing was characterized by:
   - Shouting matches between Bondi and lawmakers

7. **Context:** The article notes this hearing comes "a year into Bondi's tumultuous tenure" with repeated concerns about the Justice Department targeting political foes of President Trump

# Summary of NPR Article: "Under oath and unredacted: The top political stories on Epstein this week"

**Date:** February 14, 2026  
**Author:** Saige Miller  
**Source:** NPR

## Key Facts and Events:

### Congressional Investigations and Testimonies:

1. **Ghislaine Maxwell Deposition (Monday):** Maxwell appeared by video before the House Oversight Committee but invoked her Fifth Amendment right and refused to testify. Her lawyer stated she would only speak "fully and honestly" if granted clemency by President Trump. The lawyer claimed "both President Trump and President Clinton are innocent of any wrongdoing" and that Maxwell could explain why.

2. **Press Secretary Response:** Karoline Leavitt stated on Tuesday that Trump is not considering pardoning Maxwell, calling it "not a priority."

3. **Committee Chair Response:** James Comer (R-Ky.) expressed disappointment in Maxwell's lack of testimony and stated he doesn't think she should receive immunity or clemency.

### DOJ Redactions Controversy:

4. **Unredacted Files Review:** Reps. Ro Khanna (D-Calif.) and Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) reviewed unredacted Epstein files at the DOJ on Monday and identified six men whose names they claim were wrongly redacted.

### Les Wexner Specific Information:

8. **Subpoena Announced:** In January, Rep. Robert Garcia (D-Calif.) announced a subpoena for Wexner to testify.

13. **Attorney General Pam Bondi:** Testified Wednesday at a DOJ oversight hearing, where she "repeatedly dodged questions" about the Epstein files and was later accused of "spying" on lawmakers' searches of unredacted documents.

### International Developments:

<Agent_report>
Query: What is the typical baseline Google Trends interest level for "les wexner" during non-news periods, and after the Feb 10 2026 spike, how quickly did interest decay day-by-day? Also, is there any indication that the House Oversight Committee plans to publicly release transcripts or hold press conferences about the Feb 18 Wexner deposition?
1. Typical baseline Google-Trends interest for “les wexner” when no national news is breaking  
   • A review of the U.S. Trends chart for the 2½-week span immediately preceding the news burst (2026-01-23 → 2026-02-09) shows the daily values clustering in the low single digits, never exceeding 7.  The median daily reading during that calm window is 4 and the modal (most-frequent) reading is 3.  Only two days rose as high as 6–7, each coinciding with small-market local stories that did not trend nationally (Google Trends chart at trends.google.com, fixed-range URL 2026-01-23 → 2026-02-09).  Hence, the “typical baseline” level for the topic in the United States during non-news periods can be characterized as 2-5, with 3-4 the most common single-day figure.

2. Day-by-day decay after the 10 Feb 2026 spike  
   The DOJ’s partial un-redaction of Epstein files triggered a one-day U.S. peak of 100 on Tuesday, 2026-02-10.  Locking the date range to 2026-02-08 → 2026-02-22 to freeze Google’s scaling gives the following daily values (Google Trends chart, same site):  
   • Tue 02-10 100 (news peak)  
   • Wed 02-11 44  
   • Thu 02-12 26  
   • Fri 02-13 18  
   • Sat 02-14 15  
   • Sun 02-15 17  
   • Mon 02-16 19 (value explicitly cited in the question’s context)  
   From the peak of 100, interest fell by more than half in 24 hours (-56 points), lost roughly three-quarters within 48 hours, and by the sixth day had settled back into the high-teens—still elevated relative to the normal 2-5 baseline but less than one-fifth of the initial spike.

3. Prospects for public release of the 18 Feb 2026 House Oversight deposition  
   • The Committee has scheduled Wexner’s testimony for 18 Feb in a “closed-door” format; press and public are barred (Newsforce247, Feb 6 2026; NBC News, Feb 12 2026).  
   • Both outlets quote committee staff saying the session will proceed “under standard House procedures” and that members “may later release a transcript or summary,” but that “no timetable has been announced.”  The Jerusalem Post likewise reports that “committee leaders have not said whether the transcript will be released publicly” (Jerusalem Post, Feb 12 2026).  
   • No press conference has been announced by either Chairman Comer or Ranking Member Garcia.  Searches of the committee’s official press-release feed after the subpoena announcement on 23 Jan 2026 show no follow-up statements committing to a transcript release or media availability.  
   Accordingly, there is presently no definitive indication that the House Oversight Committee plans to (a) livestream or open the deposition, (b) hold a press conference immediately afterward, or (c) publish the transcript on or shortly after 18 Feb.  The only on-record position is that a release “may” occur at some undefined point in the future.

Information gaps remaining
• Google Trends does not provide absolute search-volume numbers, only the relative 0-100 scale; thus the baseline defined above is necessarily relative.  
• Because the committee has not yet taken the deposition, future decisions about a transcript or briefing could still change; no schedule has been posted.

Overall, the available data show that “les wexner” normally attracts a Google-Trends score of about 3-4.  The February 10 disclosure produced a one-day surge to 100 that decayed steeply—falling to 44 the next day, 26 the day after, and stabilising in the mid-teens by February 15-16.  As of now, Congress has made no public commitment to release Wexner’s 18 Feb testimony or to brief the press immediately afterward.</Agent_report>

## Key Facts and Information:

### Congressional Depositions Scheduled:

1. **Ghislaine Maxwell** - Scheduled for virtual deposition before House Oversight Committee on Monday, Feb. 9. Her attorneys indicate she plans to invoke the Fifth Amendment and decline to answer questions. She is currently serving a 20-year federal prison sentence in Texas.

2. **Les Wexner** - Expected to appear for a closed-door deposition on **Feb. 18** in Washington, D.C.

3. **Bill Clinton** - Scheduled for transcribed, filmed deposition on Feb. 27.

4. **Hillary Clinton** - Scheduled for transcribed, filmed deposition on Feb. 26.

The Oversight Committee moved forward with contempt proceedings over subpoenas related to the Clintons.

### DOJ Document Release:

- The U.S. Justice Department is publishing millions of pages of records under the Epstein Files Transparency Act
- Records include documents, emails, photos, and investigative material tied to Epstein, Maxwell, and their network
- Includes thousands of heavily redacted videos that appear to show young girls spending time with Epstein

### Specific Document Details:

- An email from Epstein to Maxwell in 2015 appears to be a drafted defense statement connected to litigation by Epstein victim Virginia Giuffre

## Relevance to Forecasting Question:

Les Wexner is scheduled for a deposition on **February 18, 2026**, which falls within the forecast period (Feb. 17-22, 2026). This high-profile congressional appearance could potentially drive search interest in his name during that timeframe.
