Analysis:
To judge whether Google searches for “les wexner” are likely to rise, fall, or stay flat over the next five days I need to know if something news-worthy involving Wexner is breaking or scheduled (e.g., court filings about the Jeffrey Epstein cases, comments in L Brands/Bath & Body Works financial reports, a new documentary, public appearance, or philanthropy announcement). Recent or upcoming media coverage, lawsuits, or corporate events could quickly push the Google Trends line up; an absence of such stimuli would point to little change or a slow decline after any prior spike. Therefore the most useful articles are very fresh (past few days or embargoed for the coming week) and directly mention Les Wexner, his family foundation, Epstein litigation, Victoria’s Secret, or L Brands. I will search both the open web and dedicated news verticals, and use AskNews to surface any scheduled items for 17–22 Feb 2026.
