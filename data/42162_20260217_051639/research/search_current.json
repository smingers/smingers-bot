Strauss died by suicide in 2005.\n\n3. **Wexner's Role:** Wexner was a member of the OSU board of trustees during the period when Strauss allegedly abused students. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing in the Strauss case.\n\n4. **Subpoena Process:** Survivors attempted to serve Wexner with a subpoena since September 2025. They held protests at the end of 2025, alleging Wexner's security and lawyer thwarted process servers. U.S. District Judge Michael H. Watson intervened in January 2026 to serve Wexner through alternative means. Wexner's lawyers filed a motion to quash the subpoena, which was denied on Tuesday.\n\n5. **Court Order:** Judge Watson stated \"Plaintiffs are entitled to discover what Mr. Wexner knew about Dr. Strauss and when he knew it.\" Wexner must sit for a deposition within 60 days.\n\n6. **Additional Subpoena:** Wexner has been ordered by the House Oversight Committee to testify on February 18 about his ties to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n7. **Epstein Connection:** Wexner's name appears in the Epstein files and he was once labeled an Epstein co-conspirator by the FBI according to a 2019 document. A Wexner legal representative stated that an Assistant U.S. Attorney told them in 2019 that Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target.\n\n## Quotes from Named Sources:\n\n- **Steve Snyder-Hill** (former OSU student and plaintiff): \"I am happy that billionaires cannot buy their way out of the justice system\"\n\n- **Mike Di Sabato** (former OSU wrestler and Strauss accuser): The ruling \"reinforces that no individual is above the search for truth and accountability\" and \"Survivors deserve transparency, and meaningful answers are essential for justice\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://spectrumnews1.com/oh/columbus/news/2026/02/16/why-ohio-billionaire-s-deposition-for-epstein-files-matters\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Why Ohio billionaire's deposition for Epstein files matters\"\n\n**Source:** Spectrum News 1\n\n## Key Facts and Events:\n\n1. **Les Wexner's appearance in Epstein files:** Ohio billionaire Les Wexner is mentioned nearly 200 times in recently unredacted Epstein files due to his relationship with convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein, who served as Wexner's financier.\n\n2. **Congressional subpoena:** Congress recently served Wexner with a subpoena for a deposition.

The new caretakers, Christof and Tanja Brunner, are preparing to welcome hikers, tourists, and food enthusiasts to the 1,094-meter-high location on Kreuzberg, which offers panoramic views extending to the Rax, Kampalpe, and Sonnwendstein. Originally built in 1894 as a hunting lodge for Baron Rothschild, the hut was acquired in 1927 by the 'Ausflugsgesellschaft Speckbacher', a Vienna-based association named after Tyrolean freedom fighter Josef Speckbacher. It was officially opened as the Speckbacher-H\u00fctte in September 1928 after the previous hut on the Rax was dismantled due to its location in a protected water source area. The site also features a 1908-planted Himalayan rhododendron, now spanning 130 square meters and recognized as one of Europe\u2019s largest. The former owners, facing a family death, staffing shortages, and commitments to a nearby pilgrimage site hotel, stepped down after over ten years. The new team, both newcomers to hut management, aim to serve regional home-style cuisine from local producers. They are currently seeking a service worker for weekend shifts and a kitchen helper for 10\u201320 hours weekly, welcoming career changers. Christof Brunner, formerly a forest technician in Vienna, and Tanja Brunner, a gardener, are committed to maintaining the hut\u2019s charm. The heating system was recently upgraded, ensuring a warm and inviting atmosphere for guests. According to Christof Brunner, 'We are ourselves complete newcomers,' emphasizing their enthusiasm and dedication to preserving the hut\u2019s legacy.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 03:31 AM\nSource:[Heute.at](https://www.heute.at/s/beliebtes-ausflugsziel-speckbacherhuette-ist-zurueck-120162537)\n\n**GOP senators decline to give away Wexner donations, amid Epstein probe**\nSeveral Ohio politicians have donated campaign contributions received from Les Wexner, the billionaire founder of L Brands and former financial advisor to Jeffrey Epstein, following the release of FBI documents labeling Wexner a possible 'co-conspirator' in the Epstein case. U.S. Representatives Joyce Beatty (D) and Mike Carey (R) have donated funds from Les Wexner to organizations supporting survivors of human trafficking, while Beatty and Carey are keeping contributions from Abigail Wexner. Former Senator Sherrod Brown (D) criticized Republican Senator Jon Husted for accepting over $100,000 from Wexner, especially after Husted initially voted against releasing the Epstein files, though he later supported their release. Husted stated he voted to make the files public and will await the congressional hearing before judging Wexner\u2019s actions. Senator Bernie Moreno (R) received $3,500 from Les Wexner in 2025 and will not return it. Columbus Mayor Andrew Ginther, who received $156,800 from the Wexners over a decade (with $91,800 from Les and $65,000 from Abigail), has not announced plans to return the funds, citing that Wexner has not been criminally charged. Other officials, including City Council President Shannon Hardin, City Attorney Zach Klein, and Councilmember Emmanuel Remy, have either donated or are donating funds from Les Wexner while retaining contributions from Abigail Wexner. State Sen. Beth Liston (D) and Michele Reynolds (R) also returned donations from Les Wexner to charities focused on youth and family support. The distinction between donations from Les and Abigail Wexner is central to the decisions, with no evidence linking Abigail Wexner to the Epstein case. The controversy underscores growing scrutiny over political ties to wealthy donors amid ongoing investigations into Epstein\u2019s network.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 08:17 PM\nSource:[Yahoo](https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/gop-senators-decline-away-wexner-201752926.html)\n\n**How the Pros Predict Marketing Will Change in 2026 | WordStream**\nTen marketing professionals shared their predictions for how marketing will evolve by 2026, with AI playing a central role across all forecasts. Key trends include a shift from audience-based to intent- and context-driven targeting, as AI agents pre-filter content for users; a renewed focus on SEO alongside generative AI optimization (GEO), with Google still dominating search traffic despite AI competition; hyper-personalization across digital platforms driven by real-time data signals; the growing importance of proprietary data and original insights to stand out in AI-generated content; AI exposing low-quality, generic marketing by favoring brands with unique perspectives and data; small businesses leveraging micro- and nano-influencers for higher engagement and authentic community building; Google\u2019s Gemini potentially surpassing ChatGPT due to infrastructure and lower friction from ads; a move from keyword-first to interest-first content creation aligned with user behavior; interactive, participatory marketing experiences like calculators and quizzes becoming essential for engagement and data collection; and growing consumer and marketer backlash against AI over-hype, environmental concerns, and lack of transparency\u2014leading to calls for labeling human-created content.

Market dynamics were driven by AI-related sectors, with chip, memory, and computing power themes leading gains. AI stocks, including MiniMax, surged\u2014MiniMax\u2019s share price hit a high of 886 HKD and closed at 845 HKD, a 24.56% increase, marking the highest share price since 2026. Gold, precious metals, and oil stocks also outperformed, while dining and real estate sectors lagged. Trading volume was reduced by approximately 400 billion HKD compared to the previous Friday, reflecting holiday season effects. Domestic AI developments, such as new models from ByteDance and Alibaba during the Spring Festival period, and international events like India\u2019s first AI summit featuring Jensen Huang and Google\u2019s CEO, fueled market enthusiasm. High-grade firms like Goldman Sachs introduced a new 'AI-resilience' investment portfolio, and Deutsche Bank emphasized that AI-driven investment represents a structural shift requiring attention to the entire value chain, including data centers, power, and infrastructure. Deutsche Bank\u2019s CIO, Norrington, noted growing interest in Chinese and emerging market assets from Europe and the U.S., highlighting the importance of disciplined, diversified investing amid U.S. inflation data (PCE, GDP), FOMC minutes, and geopolitical risks\u2014such as satellite images showing a U.S. aircraft carrier near Oman. Despite 267 billion HKD in net inflows to Hong Kong stocks during the pre-holiday week, stable foreign capital outflows totaled 104 billion HKD, and flexible foreign capital outflows reached 251 billion HKD.

The deposition follows the release of FBI documents in January 2026 that labeled Wexner a 'co-conspirator' alongside Ghislaine Maxwell, Jean-Luc Brunel, and others in connection with Epstein\u2019s child sex trafficking charges. Despite the FBI\u2019s 2019 statement that Wexner was 'neither a co-conspirator nor a target,' the newly released Epstein files reveal over 1,300 mentions of Wexner, including an undated draft letter from Epstein stating, 'You and I had 'gang stuff' for over 15 years.' Wexner claims he severed ties with Epstein in 2008 and denies knowledge of Epstein\u2019s crimes. However, documents show Epstein controlled Wexner\u2019s finances, allegedly misappropriating at least $200 million, with $100 million returned in 2008. Epstein also held power of attorney, was named trustee of Wexner\u2019s children\u2019s trust, and co-presided over the New Albany Company. Properties, including Wexner\u2019s Manhattan mansion and homes in Ohio, were transferred to Epstein-controlled entities. A 2019 memo notes Epstein bought and resold properties to himself at a discount. Wexner\u2019s former CFO, Robert Morosky, claimed Epstein used L Brands aircraft to transport underage girls in the 1990s, which Wexner\u2019s spokesperson denied due to Morosky\u2019s termination in 1987. In 2019, Wexner expressed shock at the allegations, calling it a 'tremendous shock,' and stated he was deceived. He stepped down as CEO and Chairman of L Brands in May 2020 and exited the board in 2021, though he remains chair of The Ohio State University Wexner Medical Center Board. Despite retreating from public life, Wexner has grown his net worth through real estate and AI investments. He is also scheduled to testify in a lawsuit involving former students at Ohio State University. The FBI has acknowledged limited evidence of Wexner\u2019s involvement, but his relationship with Epstein continues to draw scrutiny.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/simonemelvin/2026/02/16/everything-we-know-about-les-wexner-in-the-epstein-files/)\n\n**Operator Sought for Christkindlmarkt at Maria-Theresien-Platz in Vienna for 2026 Season**\nThe Burghauptmannschaft is seeking a new operator for the Christkindlmarkt at Maria-Theresien-Platz in Vienna for the 2026 season, with the event scheduled to run from November 16 to January 1.

According to Marie Agez, 'We were supposed to open in a month, unfortunately, a gust of wind wiped out our hopes.' The loss is especially devastating as they had already suffered a series of setbacks in 2025, including a severe hailstorm and the death of Marie\u2019s father in late August. The financial and emotional toll is immense: they invested all their savings into the project, expecting a quick return on investment after the planned March opening. However, insurance claims will delay recovery. Marie described the event as 'months of work gone in seconds,' emphasizing the loss of cherished memories and shared efforts with friends and family. The couple now faces uncertainty, as they must begin summer vegetable planting in one month but are unsure how to proceed.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 05:14 AM\nSource:[actu.fr](https://actu.fr/nouvelle-aquitaine/cazeres-sur-l-adour_40080/nous-devions-ouvrir-dans-un-mois-dans-les-landes-le-reve-de-marie-et-dimitri-brise-en-un-coup-de-vent_63842819.html)\n\n**Batimoi 2026: Increased Public Interest in Renovation Drives Show Success**\nThe Batimoi construction and renovation trade show concluded on Monday at the WEX in Marche-en-Famenne, with organizers reporting a successful 28th edition marked by heightened public interest in renovation.
