The ruling was issued Wednesday by U.S. District Court Judge Michael H. Watson and U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Preston Deavers.\n\n2. **Wexner's OSU Connection:** Wexner has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to OSU and served on the school's board of trustees during a period when Strauss was under internal investigation and when his full-time employment positions were terminated. Strauss continued as faculty emeritus until his death by suicide in 2005.\n\n3. **Court's Rationale:** The judges stated that Wexner's testimony is relevant because of \"the timing and length of Mr. Wexner's tenure on the OSU board of trustees, including his time as vice chairman and chairman of the full board, as well as ranking positions on the board's Personnel Committee.\" Plaintiffs seek to discover what Wexner knew about Dr. Strauss and when he knew it.\n\n4. **Wexner's Position:** Wexner has maintained he never communicated with or about Strauss and was unaware of any allegations during his board tenure. The judges noted that if true, \"this would be evidence of OSU's deliberate indifference.\"\n\n5. **Timeline:** Wexner must appear for a deposition within 60 days of the order.\n\n6. **Legal Maneuvering:** For months, Wexner and his attorneys refused to accept the subpoena, later arguing his testimony was sought for an \"improper publicity-generating purpose.\" The court rejected both his motion to quash the subpoena and his request for a protective order.\n\n7. **Legal Representation:** Wexner has been represented by a Columbus-based law firm whose managing partner, John Zeiger, currently serves as chair of OSU's board of trustees.\n\n8. **Epstein Connection:** The article notes Wexner faces \"increasing international scrutiny\" over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein, who served as Wexner's financial advisor. This week, the Department of Justice unredacted a 2019 FBI document labeling Wexner as a co-conspirator of Epstein's at Congress' insistence. Wexner has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein.\n\n9. **Name Removal Efforts:** An Ohio State committee is reviewing a second formal request to remove Wexner's name from multiple campus buildings, including the football team's practice facility. The school denied an initial request last month from Stephen Snyder-Hill, a lead plaintiff who was among the first to raise concerns about Strauss in the mid-1990s.\n\n## Statements:\n\n**From plaintiffs' attorneys (Sarah Bradshaw and Joe Sauder):** \"This ruling represents another important step toward transparency and accountability.\"\n\n**Wexner spokesperson and Ohio State:** Did not immediately respond to requests for comment or declined to comment.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.wyso.org/2026-02-11/judge-orders-les-wexner-to-testify-in-lawsuit-against-ohio-state-over-richard-strauss-sexual-abuse\">\n# Summary of Article: Judge orders Les Wexner to testify in lawsuit against Ohio State over Richard Strauss' sexual abuse\n\n**Source:** WYSO  \n**Date:** February 11, 2026\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n1. **Court Order:** U.S. District Court Judge Michael Watson denied a motion to quash a subpoena on Wednesday, ordering Ohio billionaire Les Wexner to testify in a lawsuit against Ohio State University related to sexual abuse by former team doctor Richard Strauss.\n\n2. **Strauss Abuse Timeline:** Richard Strauss sexually abused hundreds of students while working at Ohio State between the 1970s and 1998.\n\n3. **Wexner's OSU Role:** Wexner's time as a member and chair of Ohio State's board of trustees overlapped with Strauss' employment period.\n\n4. **Lawsuit Status:** Ohio State has settled with approximately half of the plaintiffs, but many are still suing the university.\n\n5. **Testimony Purpose:** According to Judge Watson's ruling, plaintiffs are entitled to discover what Wexner knew about Dr. Strauss and when he knew it. The testimony may illuminate:\n   - What the board did to monitor OSU's sexual harassment compliance\n   - Whether Wexner or the board had knowledge about allegations surrounding Dr. Strauss\n   - Potential evidence of OSU's deliberate indifference to allegations raised against Dr. Strauss as early as 1979\n\n6. **Deposition Timeline:** Watson ordered Wexner to sit for a deposition within the next 60 days.\n\n7. **Congressional Testimony:** Wexner is also facing a deposition before the U.S. House of Representatives on February 18 about his close ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Wexner did not fight this subpoena and said he would fully cooperate with Congress' inquiry.\n\n8. **Third Connection:** Wexner is linked to a third high-profile sexual abuse case involving former Abercrombie and Fitch CEO Mike Jeffries (who was hired by Wexner), who faces sex trafficking and interstate prostitution charges.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/judge-orders-les-wexner-testify-ohio-state-abuse-survivors-lawsuit-rcna258748\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Judge orders Leslie Wexner to testify in Ohio State abuse survivors' lawsuit\"\n\n**Source:** NBC News  \n**Date:** February 12, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n1. **Court Ruling:** On Tuesday, February 12, 2026, the Southern District of Ohio ordered billionaire Leslie Wexner to testify in a lawsuit brought by former Ohio State University students who allege they were sexually assaulted by campus doctor Richard Strauss.\n\n2. **Lawsuit Details:** 236 men are currently suing Ohio State for damages related to alleged abuse by Strauss, which occurred from the mid-1970s to the late 1990s, mostly under the guise of medical physicals. Strauss died by suicide in 2005.\n\n3. **Wexner's Role:** Wexner was a member of the OSU board of trustees during the period when Strauss allegedly abused students. He has not been accused of any wrongdoing in the Strauss case.\n\n4. **Subpoena Process:** Survivors attempted to serve Wexner with a subpoena since September 2025. They held protests at the end of 2025, alleging Wexner's security and lawyer thwarted process servers. U.S. District Judge Michael H. Watson intervened in January 2026 to serve Wexner through alternative means. Wexner's lawyers filed a motion to quash the subpoena, which was denied on Tuesday.\n\n5. **Judge's Rationale:** Judge Watson stated: \"Plaintiffs are entitled to discover what Mr. Wexner knew about Dr. Strauss and when he knew it.\"\n\n6. **Deposition Timeline:** Wexner must sit for a deposition within 60 days of the court order.\n\n7. **Additional Congressional Subpoena:** Wexner has been ordered by the House Oversight Committee to testify on February 18 about his ties to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n8. **Epstein Connection:** Wexner's name appears in the Epstein files and he was once labeled an Epstein co-conspirator by the FBI according to a 2019 document. Epstein was Wexner's primary money manager and investor. Wexner claims he cut ties with Epstein after abuse allegations emerged and that a U.S. Attorney told his counsel in 2019 that he was neither a co-conspirator nor target.\n\n9. **Survivor Reactions:** \n   - Steve Snyder-Hill (former OSU student and plaintiff): \"I am happy that billionaires cannot buy their way out of the justice system\"\n   - Mike Di Sabato (former OSU wrestler and Strauss accuser): The ruling \"reinforces that no individual is above the search for truth and accountability\"\n\n10. **Background:** Wexner founded L Brands, which included Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cleveland.com/news/2026/02/rep-massie-confronts-ag-bondi-over-redaction-of-les-wexners-name-in-epstein-files.html\">\n# Summary of Article: Rep. Massie confronts AG Bondi over redaction of Les Wexner's name in Epstein files\n\n**Date:** February 11, 2026  \n**Source:** cleveland.com  \n**Author:** Sabrina Eaton\n\n## Key Facts and Events:\n\n1. **Congressional Hearing:** U.S. Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY) criticized the Department of Justice during a hearing with Attorney General Pam Bondi for initially redacting Les Wexner's name from a document that allegedly listed Wexner as a co-conspirator in child sex trafficking.\n\n2. **Upcoming Testimony:** Les Wexner, 88, of New Albany, Ohio, has been subpoenaed to testify before the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on **February 18** about his ties to Jeffrey Epstein.\n\n3. **Justice Department Memo (December 2019):**\n   - Wexner's attorneys told federal prosecutors that \"Wexner had no knowledge of any inappropriate or unlawful activity with young women by Epstein\"\n   - Wexner claimed Epstein stole or misappropriated several hundred million dollars from him\n   - Their financial relationship ended in 2007\n\n4. **Wexner's Legal Representative's Statement:** The Assistant U.S. Attorney told Wexner's legal counsel in 2019 that Wexner was neither a co-conspirator nor target. Wexner cooperated fully and was never contacted again.\n\n5. **Redaction Issue:** \n   - Massie discussed a heavily redacted FBI document titled \"child sex trafficking\" where Wexner's name appeared but was initially redacted\n   - AG Bondi responded that the redaction error was corrected within 40 minutes\n   - Bondi noted Wexner's name was cited thousands of times in released Epstein files\n\n6. **Allegations from Virginia Roberts Giuffre:** According to Rep. Robert Garcia (D-CA), Giuffre named Wexner in a deposition as one of the men she was trafficked to.\n\n7. **Background on Wexner:**\n   - Ohio's wealthiest person with multi-billion dollar net worth\n   - Founded L Brands (includes Victoria's Secret and Bath & Body Works)\n   - Employed Epstein as a financial advisor before severing ties\n   - Epstein is believed to have acquired much of his fortune through Wexner, including the Manhattan mansion where Epstein allegedly committed sexual assaults\n\n8. **Document Release Concerns:** Massie criticized the DOJ for releasing victims' names while over-redacting alleged perpetrators' names, and questioned when authorities decided against prosecuting Wexner.\n\n**Note:** Wexner has denied any wrongdoing.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2026/2/11/wexner-epstein-co-conspirator/\">\n# Summary of Article: Harvard Donor Leslie Wexner Named Among Epstein Co-Conspirators, DOJ Records Show\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Leslie H. Wexner identified as co-conspirator**: An internal FBI document from August 2019 labeled Wexner as a \"co-conspirator\" of Jeffrey Epstein. This document was part of millions of files released by the Department of Justice in late January, with Wexner's name remaining redacted until Monday night (when Rep. Thomas Massie called for disclosure).\n\n2. **Wexner's relationship to Epstein**: \n   - Wexner was Epstein's only publicly acknowledged client for decades and the primary source of Epstein's wealth\n   - Epstein lived in a New York residence previously owned by Wexner until his 2019 arrest\n   - Wexner was former CEO of Victoria's Secret\n\n3. **Harvard donations**:\n   - Wexner gave more than $42 million to Harvard Kennedy School before 2012\n   - One of six main campus buildings at the Kennedy School bears his name\n   - Funded $3.6 million construction of Harvard Hillel building in 1994 (deal facilitated by Epstein)\n   - Publicly severed ties with Harvard in October 2023, citing the University's response to Hamas' Oct. 7, 2023 attack on Israel\n\n4. **Financial transactions**: According to documents released in January, Epstein paid Wexner $100 million in 2008 (per Wexner's lawyers to prosecutors in July 2019)\n\n5. **FBI investigation timeline**:\n   - Emails released in December show Wexner was under investigation by FBI in 2019\n   - July 2019 emails show FBI sought to locate, interview, and subpoena Wexner as one of ten \"co-conspirators\" in federal grand jury investigation\n   - August 2019: Internal FBI email concluded there was \"limited evidence\" regarding Wexner's involvement, but same day FBI circulated memo labeling him as co-conspirator\n\n## Wexner's Claims:\n- Claims he cut ties with Epstein in 2007\n- In 2019 letter, stated Epstein \"misappropriated vast sums of money from me and my family\"\n- Has maintained he was an unknowing victim of Epstein's manipulation\n\n## Additional Context:\n- Epstein maintained near-total control over Wexner's assets as his financial manager, including power of attorney\n- Photos of Wexner and his wife with Epstein were released in December under the Epstein Files Transparency Act\n- Court filings reference Wexner's estate in New Albany, Ohio, including allegations from an Epstein victim\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/judge-orders-les-wexner-testify-ohio-state-abuse-survivors-lawsuit-rcna258748\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Judge orders Leslie Wexner to testify in Ohio State abuse survivors' lawsuit\"\n\n**Source:** NBC News  \n**Date:** February 12, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n1. **Court Ruling:** U.S. District Judge Michael H.

Calendar of known forward-looking events (17-22 Feb 2026)\n\n1. 18 Feb 2026 \u2013 Congressional deposition on Epstein ties  \n   \u2022 The U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform will take sworn testimony from Les Wexner on 18 February.  \n   \u2022 Location: Wexner\u2019s residence in New Albany, Ohio (the venue was moved from the Rayburn House Office Building in Washington, D.C.).  \n   \u2022 The session will be closed to the public; a transcript may or may not be released later, according to committee staff. (WOSU, 11 Feb 2026; Columbus Dispatch, 11 Feb 2026; AOL, 16 Feb 2026; Cleveland Jewish News, 11 Feb 2026)\n\n2. 19 Feb 2026 \u2013 Public programme at the Wexner Center for the Arts  \n   \u2022 \u201cOhio Goes to the Movies\u201d film screening of The Male Animal (1942) plus the short The Unicorn in the Garden (1953).  \n   \u2022 Although curated by the Wexner Center rather than Les Wexner personally, the brand name is likely to appear prominently in local listings and social media. (Thurber House spring events page, 19 Feb 2026)\n\n3. 20 Feb 2026 \u2013 Record date for Bath & Body Works quarterly dividend  \n   \u2022 The company Wexner founded (formerly the flagship of L Brands) set 20 February as the shareholder-of-record date for its US$0.20 dividend payable 6 March.  \n   \u2022 While Wexner no longer holds an executive role, he is still one of the best-known individual shareholders, so the announcement may draw ancillary searches for his name. (SimplyWallSt, 16 Feb 2026)\n\nNo court hearings, documentary premieres or Wexner Foundation gatherings fall inside the 17-22 February window. The federal judge\u2019s order that Wexner give a deposition in the Ohio State\u2013Richard Strauss civil litigation requires him to appear \u201cwithin 60 days\u201d of 11 February, but no date has yet been fixed (WOSU, 11 Feb 2026; Columbus Dispatch, 11 Feb 2026). Likewise, the Wexner Foundation\u2019s next publicly posted meeting is on 6 May 2026.\n\nB. Press coverage since 1 January 2026 \u2013 themes and highlights\n\n1. Epstein files and congressional pressure  \n   \u2022 The Department of Justice\u2019s 30 January mass release of more than 3 million pages of \u201cEpstein files\u201d put Wexner\u2019s name back into headlines; several internal FBI memoranda now label him an \u201cunindicted co-conspirator\u201d, though prosecutors note \u201climited evidence\u201d (Cleveland Jewish News, 11 Feb 2026; CNN Politics, 10 Feb 2026).  \n   \u2022 Bipartisan sponsors of the Epstein Files Transparency Act, Reps. Ro Khanna and Thomas Massie, reviewed unredacted versions at DOJ on 10 Feb and then revealed in floor speeches that Wexner was one of six names that had been hidden (Guardian, 13 Feb 2026; Al Jazeera, 11 Feb 2026).  \n   \u2022 These revelations triggered the 18 Feb deposition subpoena and a fresh round of stories exploring Wexner\u2019s 1986-2007 financial relationship with Epstein, including a newly disclosed 2008 settlement in which Epstein repaid the Wexners US$100 million (AOL, 16 Feb 2026).\n\n2. Court-ordered deposition in Ohio State sexual-abuse lawsuit  \n   \u2022 On 11 February U.S. District Judge Michael Watson denied Wexner\u2019s motion to quash a subpoena and ordered him to be deposed within 60 days in the Richard Strauss survivor suits against Ohio State University, where Wexner chaired the Board of Trustees during part of the Strauss era (WOSU, 11 Feb 2026; Columbus Dispatch, 11 Feb 2026).  \n   \u2022 The ruling cites plaintiffs\u2019 right to learn what Wexner \u201cknew and when he knew it\u201d about abuse allegations. This creates a second high-profile deposition in the same timeframe as the congressional testimony and keeps the story prominent.\n\n3. Political money blow-back  \n   \u2022 Following the unredacted file releases, elected officials in Ohio from both parties announced they will donate prior campaign contributions from Les or Abigail Wexner to charity. Named recipients of Wexner money who are returning or reallocating funds include U.S. Reps. Joyce Beatty and Mike Carey, State Senators Beth Liston and Michele Reynolds, and several Columbus-area local officials (WOSU, 16 Feb 2026).  \n   \u2022 The cross-party nature of the refunds underscores that the Epstein connection rather than partisan conflict is driving the negative attention.\n\n4. Foundation and cultural activities  \n   \u2022 Apart from routine council calls (last held 5 Feb 2026), the Wexner Foundation has not announced any special events in February; its next public calendar item is the Q2 Alumni Council call on 6 May 2026 (Wexner Foundation site, accessed 16 Feb 2026).  \n   \u2022 Cultural references to the Wexner name\u2014such as the 19 Feb film screening at the Wexner Center\u2014continue but with no direct involvement by Les Wexner.\n\n5. Corporate context  \n   \u2022 Bath & Body Works, now fully separate from former parent L Brands, remains a lightning rod for any Wexner-related news even though he stepped down from all corporate roles in 2020. The company\u2019s 6 March dividend and an expanded Disney Princess product line were announced in early February (SimplyWallSt, 16 Feb 2026).  \n   \u2022 Financial media link such announcements to Wexner in historical background pieces but they do not list him as a current decision-maker.\n\nC. Implications for Google-Trends \u201cinterest over time\u201d\n\nThe concentration of two marquee events\u2014Wexner\u2019s closed-door congressional deposition on 18 Feb and the Wexner Center film programme on 19 Feb\u2014right in the middle of the 17-22 February measurement window gives analysts a concrete basis to expect a spike in search activity:\n\n\u2022 The 18 Feb deposition is news-worthy, politically charged, linked to the high-profile Epstein saga, and certain to be covered by national outlets even if no video is released. Prior episodes (e.g., the DOJ file drop on 30 Jan and the unredaction fight on 10-13 Feb) generated multi-day clusters of articles across CNN, Guardian, Al Jazeera and local Ohio media, each time lifting \u201cLes Wexner\u201d mentions.\n\n\u2022 Even though the hearing is closed, reporters will likely camp outside the New Albany estate and immediately publish summaries and reaction quotes, generating another round of stories over the 18-19 Feb news cycle.\n\n\u2022 The 19 Feb cultural event at the Wexner Center is unlikely by itself to move national search traffic, but local press and social calendaring sites will push listings that include his full name and may keep the term afloat in Ohio-based searches.\n\nNo offsetting negative catalyst (such as a quiet period or holiday) falls inside the same span. The subsequent weekend (21-22 Feb) may feature follow-up analyses of any deposition leaks or political commentary.\n\nTherefore, there is a plausible case that Google-Trends interest in \u201cles wexner\u201d will be higher on or shortly after 18 February than on 17 February, satisfying the \u201cIncreases\u201d resolution condition, unless actual coverage is muted or overshadowed by a larger national story.\n\nD. Information gaps\n\n\u2022 Exact time of day and duration of the 18 Feb deposition remain undisclosed; if a transcript release date is set, that could further affect search behaviour.  \n\u2022 The Ohio State Strauss deposition still lacks a firm date; if it is set for 21-22 Feb the forecast could strengthen.  \n\u2022 No evidence surfaced of any documentary or TV premiere featuring Wexner in the target window; continued monitoring of streaming-platform schedules would confirm none is planned.\n\nOverall, the only firmly scheduled Wexner-specific event between 17 and 22 February 2026 is his congressional deposition on 18 February, supported by substantial surrounding news coverage that has already begun and is likely to escalate through the window.</Agent_report>\n\n<GoogleTrendsData term=\"les wexner\">\nGoogle Trends US data for \"les wexner\" (last 90 days):\n\nCurrent value: 24\n90-day mean: 6.8\n90-day std dev: 14.9\n\nBASE RATE ANALYSIS (using 5-day windows to match question timeframe):\n- In 77% of 5-day windows, the value changed by \u22643 points (\"Doesn't change\")\n- In 16% of 5-day windows, the value INCREASED by >3 points\n- In 7% of 5-day windows, the value DECREASED by >3 points\n\nRecent trend: increasing (last 7 days avg: 37.4 vs prior 7 days: 20.7)\n\nDAILY VALUES (last 30 days):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-19,2\n2026-01-20,1\n2026-01-21,1\n2026-01-22,1\n2026-01-23,1\n2026-01-24,2\n2026-01-25,2\n2026-01-26,1\n2026-01-27,2\n2026-01-28,2\n2026-01-29,2\n2026-01-30,3\n2026-01-31,8\n2026-02-01,6\n2026-02-02,9\n2026-02-03,9\n2026-02-04,8\n2026-02-05,7\n2026-02-06,7\n2026-02-07,9\n2026-02-08,7\n2026-02-09,7\n2026-02-10,100\n2026-02-11,78\n2026-02-12,58\n2026-02-13,36\n2026-02-14,27\n2026-02-15,21\n2026-02-16,18\n2026-02-17,24\n\nNote: Google Trends values are relative (0-100 scale), not absolute search volumes.\n</GoogleTrendsData>\n"
