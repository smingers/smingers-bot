## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Current DTB1YR value and recent range** (FRED official data): 3.33% on Feb 12, ranging 3.28-3.38% over past 10 days. Multiple sources confirm tight recent range. *Direction: Anchors prediction near 3.33%*

2. **No FOMC meeting before resolution** (Agent report): Next meeting March 18, after Feb 26 resolution. 89% probability of hold. *Direction: Supports stability/limited movement*

3. **Short timeframe** (9 calendar days, ~6-7 trading days): Structurally limits potential movement. *Direction: Narrow distribution*

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Mild easing trend** (FRED data + multiple news sources): 7-day MA (3.32%) below 30-day MA (3.35%); broader market pricing 62 bp of 2026 cuts; 10-year yields declining. *Direction: Slight downward bias*

2. **Recent inflation softening** (Multiple AskNews sources): January 2026 inflation at 2.4%, softer than expected, supporting rate cut expectations. *Direction: Modest downward pressure*

3. **Technical support/resistance** (Aktien Check): Support at 3.45% (for constant maturity measure), resistance 3.53-3.55%. Translating to DTB1YR: support ~3.30%, resistance ~3.40%. *Direction: Suggests range-bound behavior*

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Expert recommendation for short-term Treasuries** (Money.it): Suggests 3.5% yields attractive, but this is opinion-based investment advice, not predictive. *Direction: Minimal impact*

2. **Dollar weakness narrative** (Korean news source): Broader macro story but indirect connection to 1-year bills. *Direction: Minimal direct impact*

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 9 calendar days (Feb 17 to Feb 26), approximately 6-7 trading days.

**If halved (4-5 days):** Would expect even tighter distribution, perhaps 3.28-3.38% capturing 80% probability, as daily volatility typically ±3-5 bp allows limited cumulative movement.

**If doubled (18 days, ~13 trading days):** Would widen distribution significantly to 3.10-3.55% for 80% interval, as this approaches a full month where policy expectations could shift more materially and encompasses potential for unexpected economic data releases.

**Current timeframe assessment:** The 9-day window is short enough that structural factors (Fed policy unchanged, no major scheduled catalysts) dominate, but long enough that cumulative daily volatility could produce ±10-15 bp moves from current levels.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view established:** 10th-90th percentile of 3.15-3.52% (37 bp range), centered on 3.33% with slight downward bias.

**Current factors assessment:**

1. **Confirming factors (support outside view):**
   - Recent range-bound behavior (3.28-3.38%) aligns with outside view's core range
   - No policy meetings confirm stability assumption
   - Short timeframe limits movement as expected

2. **Adjusting factors (warrant modest shifts):**
   - **Stronger downward bias than initially estimated:** Multiple independent sources (10-year yields at 2.5-month lows, inflation softer than expected, 2-year yields at 2022 lows, market pricing increased cut probability) suggest more pronounced easing sentiment than captured by simple 7-day vs 30-day MA comparison. This warrants shifting the distribution down by ~3-5 bp.
   
   - **Tighter near-term range:** The very recent 5-day range (3.28-3.34%, only 6 bp) is tighter than the 10-day range (10 bp), suggesting reduced volatility. Combined with no catalysts before resolution, this suggests the 10th-90th percentile range could narrow slightly from 37 bp to ~32-35 bp.

**Magnitude of adjustment:** The evidence is **moderate** in strength - multiple reliable sources pointing same direction (easing bias), but no structural changes or major catalysts. This warrants shifting the distribution down by 3-5 bp while slightly narrowing the range, but not a dramatic overhaul.

**Reference class validity check:** The outside view reference class (9-day forward movements during Fed hold periods) remains highly analogous to current circumstances. The adjustment reflects refinement based on current momentum, not rejection of the reference class.

## Distribution Calibration

**Starting point (outside view):**
- 10th: 3.15%, 20th: 3.22%, 40th: 3.30%, 60th: 3.36%, 80th: 3.44%, 90th: 3.52%
- Median (interpolated): ~3.33%, Mean: ~3.34%

**Adjustments:**
1. **Shift down 4 bp** to reflect stronger easing momentum (multiple sources confirming softer inflation, declining yields across curve, increased cut probability)
2. **Narrow range by ~3 bp** (from 37 bp to 34 bp for 10th-90th) to reflect tighter recent volatility and lack of catalysts
3. **Maintain slight asymmetry** with downward skew

**Calibrated inside view:**
- 10th: 3.15% (unchanged - allows for unexpected hawkish surprise or volatility spike)
- 20th: 3.20% (down 2 bp - reflects easing bias)
- 40th: 3.28% (down 2 bp - below current value, reflecting momentum)
- 60th: 3.34% (down 2 bp - near current value as central tendency)
- 80th: 3.41% (down 3 bp - tighter upside given easing trend)
- 90th: 3.49% (down 3 bp - allows for reversal but less extreme)

**Implied statistics:**
- Median: ~3.31% (2 bp below current 3.33%)
- Mean: ~3.31% (roughly symmetric)
- 10th-90th range: 34 bp

**Sensitivity check (+/- 10% on percentiles):**
- If 10th at 3.05% (-10%): Would imply 28 bp drop possible, seems excessive for 9 days with no catalyst
- If 90th at 3.64% (+10%): Would imply 31 bp rise possible, contradicts easing momentum
- Current calibration feels appropriately balanced

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** DTB1YR value on Feb 26, 2026 (9 days forward), units in Percent. ✓

2. **Outside view anchor:** Started with 3.15-3.52% (10th-90th), centered on 3.33%. Final prediction 3.15-3.49% maintains this anchor with modest downward adjustment. ✓

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 3.31%; mean ≈ 3.31%. Makes sense: 2 bp below current value reflects mild easing momentum over 9 days without being overly aggressive. ✓

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Current DTB1YR at 3.33%, recent 5-day range 3.28-3.34% (factual, FRED data)
   - No FOMC meeting before Feb 26; 89% hold probability (factual, Fed schedule + futures)
   - Multiple sources confirm easing trend: 10-year at 2.5-month low, inflation softer (factual, multiple news)
   - Short 9-day timeframe structurally limits movement (analytical fact)
   - 7-day MA (3.32%) < 30-day MA (3.35%) shows momentum (factual, FRED data)

5. **Blind-spot:** Unexpected hawkish Fed communication or strong economic data (e.g., hot jobs report, inflation surprise) before Feb 26 could reverse easing sentiment, pushing DTB1YR toward 3.45-3.50%. This would make my downward-biased forecast look too dovish. However, probability is low given no scheduled Fed events and most major data already released.

6. **Status quo:** Current value 3.33%. Given low volatility environment and short timeframe, there's wisdom in not straying too far. My median of 3.31% (only 2 bp below) respects this while incorporating directional momentum. ✓

7. **Technicalities:** Values strictly increasing ✓, units in Percent ✓, within bounds (2.81741-4.60713) ✓
