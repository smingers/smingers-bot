Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological order of most-recent observations)
1. Federal Reserve H.15 (Feb 12 data) – primary, definitive source for DTB1YR (quality: very high, factual). Shows 3.33 % on 2026-02-12 after a 3.28–3.34 % range the prior week.  
2. TradingEconomics & Y-Charts (to Feb 13) – near-real-time feeds of constant-maturity 1-yr yields; useful as a noisy proxy (quality: good, but different metric – treat with caution). Both show a gentle drift down toward 3.42-3.47 % yield, implying ≈3.30 % discount rate.  
3. AskNews/Investing.com & Forex reports (Feb 16-17) – market commentary on 10-yr & 1-yr moves; confirm soft inflation data and >50 % odds of first Fed cut in June (quality: moderate; factual nuggets embedded in opinion pieces from identifiable market-data vendors).  
4. CME / Yahoo Finance etc. – background pieces; no hard data for the next nine days (quality: low for our horizon; ignored for numeric adjustment).

(b) Evidence analysis
• Strong: DTB1YR daily prints are extremely sticky in a 7-business-day window absent an FOMC meeting (structural, borne out by decades of data).  
• Moderate: Two independent market-data vendors and futures pricing agree that the Fed is on hold until at least March and market bias is mildly toward lower short rates after soft CPI/PPI.  
• Weak: Commentary on dollar weakness, fiscal worries, supply overhang – could add a few bp upside risk but are speculative over days rather than months.

(c) Timeframe
Forecast is 9 calendar (~7 trading) days out.  Halving to 3–4 days would tighten the distribution by ~30 %. Doubling to 18 days would widen it by ~20 % and shift the median ~2–3 bp lower, reflecting higher odds of another benign data print.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments
Outside-view baseline (built from the last month’s 3.28–3.38 % range) had median 3.34 %.  
Inside view nudges the whole distribution 2–3 bp lower because:
1. Fresh CPI, PPI, and inflation-expectations data all surprised on the soft side (moderate evidence).  
2. Fed funds futures now price in 62 bp of 2026 easing, up from ~55 bp a week ago (moderate evidence).  
3. There is no near-term catalyst (policy meeting, supply shock) likely to push the 1-yr bill sharply higher in the next week (strong evidence).  
I retain similar tail width (≈0.50 % between 10th and 90th) for “unknown unknowns” such as a surprise fiscal announcement or geopolitical shock.

Distribution calibration
(The numbers are discount-basis percent.)

10 th pct – severe risk-off rally or hot data collapse:           3.05 %  
20 th pct – continuation of current gentle downtrend:              3.15 %  
40 th pct – modest drift lower:                                   3.26 %  
60 th pct – slight rebound toward 30-day mean (new median):        3.32 %  
80 th pct – mini-sell-off on unexpectedly strong data/supply:      3.45 %  
90 th pct – large shock, e.g., abrupt fiscal risk, oil spike:      3.55 %

Checklist:
1. Target variable: DTB1YR daily close (%) on 2026-02-26.  
2. Outside-view base: 10:3.06 | 20:3.16 | 40:3.28 | 60:3.36 | 80:3.50 | 90:3.60.  
3. Consistency: implied median 3.32 %, plausible given 3.33 % last print.  
4. Key evidence: a) no FOMC before 26 Feb; b) soft January inflation; c) futures price first cut June; d) DTB1YR 1-mo range 3.28–3.38 %.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden upside CPI revision or surprise Treasury refunding could push rate above 3.55 %.  
6. Status-quo check: small nudge toward latest print maintained.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units = percent; bounds respected.
