Analysis:
a) Source analysis
1. Federal Reserve H.15 (Feb-12-2026 values) – primary data for the exact series; very high quality, purely factual.  
2. TradingEconomics / Y-Charts – republish Fed data for constant-maturity 1-yr yield; good factual cross-checks, but a different series.  
3. AskNews stream (Forex-Insta, Investing.com, etc., all dated Feb-16/17-2026) – market commentary on Treasury yields, emphasising a 10-20 bp slide in longer maturities after softer CPI.  Reputable financial-market desks, but largely opinion; factual portions: “10-yr ≈ 4.05 %, 1-yr ≈ 3.49 %”.  
4. Misc. articles on mortgages, CME futures, foreign T-bill auctions – background only, no direct bearing on DTB1YR in the next nine days.  
Overall, the hard, series-specific data (source 1) is far more weighty than market colour pieces.

b) Evidence analysis (weights refer to impact on the 9-day horizon)
• Strong: Historical 9-calendar-day volatility of DTB1YR (σ≈11 bp, central 80 % band ±14 bp).  
• Moderate: Recent mild down-drift (–8 bp in constant-maturity 1-yr since Feb-6; DTB1YR stable/slightly softer).  
• Moderate: Broad Treasury rally after soft January CPI and markets now pricing June instead of March for the first Fed cut – creates gentle downward pressure on all short rates.  
• Weak: FOMC minutes release (Feb-19) or PCE/GDP prints (Feb-26) could surprise, but historically move 1-yr bills <10 bp unless truly shocking.

c) Timeframe analysis
Target is nine calendar days (≈ 6 trading days) ahead.  If the window were halved to 3 trading days, distribution would narrow to roughly ±7 bp.  If doubled to ~12 trading days, the central 80 % band would widen to about ±18 bp.

d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Base-rate (outside view) distribution centred on 3.31 % (current 3.33 % minus a 2 bp drift).  
Current news adds a modest extra downward bias (probability of Fed cuts creeping up, 10-yr yield already ~20 bp lower than a fortnight ago).  This is worth ~1 bp on the centre and a tiny left-skew (fatter lower tail).  No catalyst argues for abandoning historical volatility parameters.  Hence I keep the same 80 % width (±15 bp) but shift the median down 2 bp to 3.31 %.

Distribution calibration
The following percentiles incorporate the above reasoning and allow a little extra width for “unknown unknowns”:

10th percentile: 3.10 %  (≈ –23 bp)  
20th percentile: 3.18 %  (≈ –15 bp)  
40th percentile: 3.25 %  (≈ –8 bp)  
60th percentile: 3.34 %  (≈ +1 bp)  
80th percentile: 3.45 %  (≈ +12 bp)  
90th percentile: 3.55 %  (≈ +22 bp)

Checklist:
1. Target variable: DTB1YR value (percent) for 26 Feb 2026 close, as published by FRED.  
2. Base-rate distribution stated and used.  
3. Consistency check – implied median ≈ 3.30 %; mean ≈ 3.30 % – matches narrative of slight downward drift with symmetric noise.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Historical 9-day σ ≈ 11 bp.  
   • Latest DTB1YR print 3.33 %.  
   • 10-yr yield down ~20 bp since Feb-6.  
   • Fed cuts now priced for June, easing bias.  
   • No major data/FOMC meeting before resolution.  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden risk-off shock (e.g., geopolitical event) could push 1-yr bill below 3.00 % rapidly.  
6. Status-quo anchor checked – most probability mass remains within ±15 bp of 3.31 %.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, correct units, within open bounds.
