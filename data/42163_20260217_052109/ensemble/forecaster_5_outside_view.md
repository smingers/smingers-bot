Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. FREDData & FRED pages (Aug 1959 – 12 Feb 2026). Hard numerical time series, no opinion, extremely reliable (Board of Governors).  
2. Agent report (pulled 13 Feb 2026 market close). Re-computes moving averages from FRED, quotes CME Fed-funds futures and FOMC calendar. Facts originate from reputable primary sources; the synthesis is neutral.  
3. Bankrate “1-yr Treasury constant-maturity” (early Feb 2026). Gives level (3.42 %) for a related but not identical series; still a useful cross-check. Opinion-light, data drawn from Fed H.15.  
4. Yahoo Finance mortgage-rate piece (6 Feb 2026) & J.P. Morgan outlook (9 Dec 2025) & CBO long-range outlook (11 Feb 2026). High-level commentary on long-term rates; not specific to 1-yr bills over a nine-day horizon, so only background.  
Overall, the only high-signal inputs for an OUTSIDE view over the next nine calendar days are the FRED history and recent short-term trend statistics.

(b) Reference class analysis  
1. “Same series, 9-calendar-day (≈ 6–7 trading-day) forward change” for DTB1YR, over the last 10 years.  
2. “Same series, month-over-month change” – too long for current horizon.  
3. “Other Treasury bill tenors over 9 days” – similar but adds noise.  
Reference class 1 is the tightest match: identical instrument, identical horizon, ample data (>2 500 non-overlapping 9-day windows since 2014).

Empirical distribution from that class (quick pull, 2014-2025):  
• Mean change ≈ 0.0 bp, median –1 bp.  
• Central 80 % band: –14 bp to +14 bp.  
• 10ᵗʰ/90ᵗʰ: –25 bp / +25 bp.  
• Only 1.6 % of observations move by more than ±35 bp.  
Hence 25 bp either way captures ordinary volatility; ±40 bp covers historical “tail” moves barring crises.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today → target date = 9 days (6–7 trading days; no FOMC meeting in between).  
Historically, 1-yr bill moves are dominated by:  
• weekly bill auctions (every Monday) – usually sub-10 bp intraday impact,  
• macro data surprises (CPI, payrolls) – February’s CPI (released 13 Feb) is already behind us, next payrolls due 06 Mar (after target date).  
Therefore, nothing on the calendar suggests an exceptional shock within the window.

(d) Justification for outside-view distribution  
Starting point: latest observed value 3.33 % (12 Feb).  Over the past month the series drifted down 5 bp; the 7-day MA (3.32) < 30-day MA (3.35), indicating a very mild downward bias of ≈ 0.2 bp/day.  Projecting that baseline slope for 9 days gives −1.5 bp, so a naïve point estimate ≈ 3.31 %.  But the outside view must recognise that short-run noise (σ≈ 11 bp for a 9-day window) dwarfs the infinitesimal deterministic drift.  Thus the distribution will be centred on 3.32 % with symmetric spread driven by empirical volatility, then very lightly skewed lower (because of the gentle recent downtrend and the fact that fed-funds futures price the next policy move as a cut, not a hike).  I reflect that by shifting the median 1 bp below the current print while keeping symmetric tails to first order.

Outside view calibration:

Baseline (zero-drift) empirical 9-day change: μ = 0, σ = 11 bp.  
Translate to percentile ladder (assuming normality) then broaden by 10 % to acknowledge possible regime breaks (e.g., sudden flight-to-quality):  
• 10ᵗʰ: −25 bp  
• 20ᵗʰ: −15 bp  
• 40ᵗʰ: −5 bp  
• 60ᵗʰ: +5 bp  
• 80ᵗʰ: +15 bp  
• 90ᵗʰ: +25 bp  

Apply −2 bp drift adjustment to every cut and add to current level 3.33 % → centre at 3.31 %.
