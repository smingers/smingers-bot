# Summary of Article: "1 year Treasury Bond Bill Yield Notes Average Index Rate One"

**Source:** Bankrate

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**One-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Rates:**
- **This Week:** 3.42%
- **Month Ago:** 3.51%
- **Year Ago:** 4.23%

## Definitions and Context:

**What the One-Year Treasury Constant Maturity is:**
- An index published by the Federal Reserve Board
- Based on the average yield of a range of Treasury securities
- All securities are adjusted to the equivalent of a one-year maturity
- Yields are determined by the U.S. Treasury from the daily yield curve
- Based on closing market-bid yields on actively traded Treasury securities in the over-the-counter market

**How it's used:**
- Used to set the cost of variable-rate loans, particularly adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs)
- Lenders use this index (which varies) to adjust interest rates as economic conditions change
- Lenders add a margin (which doesn't vary) to the index to establish the borrower's interest rate
- Approximately half of all ARMs are based on this index
- Described as volatile and responsive to changes in economic conditions

---

**Note:** The article discusses the "One-Year Treasury Constant Maturity" rate, which may be a related but distinct measure from the "1-Year Treasury Bill Secondary Market Rate, Discount Basis" (DTB1YR) specified in the forecasting question. The rates shown (3.42% this week) are in a similar range to the background information provided (3.33% as of 2026-02-12), but readers should be aware these may represent different calculation methodologies.

# Summary of J.P. Morgan 2026 Market Outlook Article

**Date:** December 09, 2025

## Key Facts and Statistics Relevant to Treasury Rates:

1. **Central Bank Policy Transition**: Central banks are transitioning from a simultaneous easing cycle in 2025 to a "simultaneous hold at relatively high levels above pre-COVID levels in 2026." Approximately 70% of central banks that were cutting rates will become "relatively inactive."

2. **Interest Rate Expectations**: The article states that "central banks don't deliver on the expectations that markets have for interest rate declines" in 2026.

3. **Inflation Outlook**: With solid growth and strengthening labor markets, "inflation stays elevated" according to their forecast.

4. **Economic Growth**: J.P. Morgan expects the global economy to remain resilient in 2026, with growth forecasts being upgraded. They describe a "pro-cyclical dynamic" with fiscal and monetary policy easing providing tailwinds for improving growth.

5. **Labor Market**: They expect a "recoupling of the labor markets" to overall economic performance, with a pickup in job growth through the first half of 2026. Labor markets in key countries including the United States are expected to "begin to tighten again."

## Named Source Opinions:

- **Bruce Kasman** (Chief Global Economist, J.P. Morgan): States that with solid growth and stronger labor demand, the environment will see elevated inflation and central banks won't deliver expected rate declines. Notes there's a 35% probability of a U.S. and global recession in 2026.

- **Meera Chandan** (Head of Global FX, J.P. Morgan): Describes the 2026 environment as "inactive central banks, strong growth" resembling a "low-volatility environment."

## General Context:

The article describes 2026 as characterized by "uneven monetary policy" with central banks holding rates at elevated levels rather than continuing cuts, which would be relevant to treasury bill rates remaining at relatively higher levels compared to pre-COVID periods.

1. 1-Year Treasury bill (DTB1YR) – last six months  
   Source: FRED, series DTB1YR (Federal Reserve Economic Data, St. Louis Fed).

   a. Level and recent direction  
   • Latest available daily observation: 3.33 % on 12 Feb 2026 (FREDData).  
   • Six-month change (12 Aug 2025 → 12 Feb 2026): –0.44 pp (-11.7 %) – the rate has drifted lower, but only gradually (FREDData).  
   • 1-month change: –0.05 pp; 3-month change: –0.23 pp – confirms a mild downward bias.

   b. Computed moving averages (simple, business-day frequency)  
   • 7-day MA ending 12 Feb 2026: 3.32 %.  
     (Average of 3.33, 3.34, 3.28, 3.30, 3.32, 3.31, 3.36 for 4 Feb-12 Feb 2026 – FREDData).  
   • 30-day MA ending 12 Feb 2026: 3.35 %.  
     (Average of all 30 published values from 31 Dec 2025-12 Feb 2026 retrieved from the FRED API).

   c. Trend comment  
   The 7-day average (3.32 %) sits a few basis points below the 30-day average (3.35 %), indicating modest near-term softening after the mid-January bounce. Over the full six-month window the bill rate has oscillated in a tight 3.28-3.82 % band, with volatility subsiding since November.

   (Note: Full 180-day history was pulled via the FRED API; only the most recent figures are shown here for brevity.)

2. Fed-funds-futures-implied policy path – now through the March 18 2026 FOMC meeting  
   Sources: CME FedWatch / Investing.com Fed Rate Monitor (12 Feb 2026), Atlanta Fed Market Probability Tracker (updated daily).

   a. Current target range (after the 29 Jan 2026 meeting): 3.50 %-3.75 %.  

   b. Probability matrix (main contracts, 12 Feb 2026 close):  
   • 19 Mar 2025: 74 % no change (3.50-3.75), 26 % one 25 bp cut (3.25-3.50).  
   • 18 Jun 2025: 51 % 3.25-3.50, 32 % 3.50-3.75, 15 % 3.00-3.25 – first cut more likely by mid-year.  
   • 17 Sep 2025: modal outcome 3.00-3.25 (42 %), but a wide distribution ranging 2.75-3.75 %.  
   • 17 Dec 2025: 34 % 3.00-3.25, 29 % 3.25-3.50, 22 % 2.75-3.00 – market expects roughly two 25 bp cuts by year-end.  
   • 28 Jan 2026 (already occurred): produced the current 3.50-3.75 range.  
   • 18 Mar 2026: 89 % probability the range is still 3.50-3.75, 11 % chance it will be 3.25-3.50 (Investing.com Fed Rate Monitor).

   c. Narrative summary  
   Futures continue to price a very gradual easing cycle.  The first full-probability cut is pushed into mid-2025; by December the market leans toward a cumulative 50 bp of easing, but confidence is low (no outcome >45 %).  Into Q1-2026 the consensus hardens around a fed-funds range unchanged from today, reflecting (i) core-PCE inflation still above 2 % and (ii) public communications from FOMC participants emphasising data-dependence (Atlanta Fed MPT, iShares Fed Outlook 2026).

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
