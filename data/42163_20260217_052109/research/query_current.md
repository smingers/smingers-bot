Analysis:
To estimate the 1-Year Treasury Bill Secondary Market Rate for 2026-02-26 I need the most up-to-date information on:
• Where the 1-year (and closely related 3-, 6-month) Treasury yields are trading now (Feb 17 2026).  
• Market expectations for Federal Reserve policy over the next two weeks, since the 1-year T-bill strongly reflects the anticipated average fed-funds rate over the coming year.  
• Any new macro releases (CPI, PPI, PCE, employment) or Fed communications scheduled or released between now and Feb 26 that could move short-term yields.  
News articles from financial wires (Bloomberg, Reuters, WSJ) typically state the latest quoted yields and explain drivers; these, plus commentary on upcoming data/FOMC developments, will provide an inside view. Therefore I’ll search for very recent stories mentioning “1-year Treasury”, “short-term Treasury yields”, “front-end yields”, plus Fed expectations around February 2026.
