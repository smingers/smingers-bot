Analysis:
The 1-Year Treasury bill rate reflects expectations of the average federal funds rate over the coming year plus a term premium. To anchor a point forecast for 26 Feb 2026 I need: 1) the recent trajectory of DTB1YR (daily pattern, moving averages, volatility), 2) information on market expectations for Fed policy over the next month (Fed funds futures, FOMC schedule, macro releases), and 3) any news that might shift those expectations (inflation data, recession concerns, Treasury issuance). Historical context—especially how the 1-year rate behaved around prior inflection points in Fed cycles—will help calibrate an outside-view distribution.
