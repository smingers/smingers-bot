Markets now anticipate a potential rate cut in June, pricing in approximately 62 basis points of easing for 2026\u2014equivalent to two quarter-point reductions and a roughly 50% probability of a third cut. Despite this, stronger-than-expected payroll growth\u2014the largest increase in over a year\u2014and an unexpected drop in the unemployment rate indicated continued strength in the labor market.

It notes that the 10-year Treasury yield has dropped sharply from a high of 4.28%-4.29% to around 4.05%, approaching a key psychological and technical threshold near 3.94%, which could signal a shift from weakness to potential strengthening in bond prices. Inflation data from January 2026 shows a slowdown, with headline inflation at 2.4% annually\u2014down from 2.7% in December\u2014driven by a 7.5% year-on-year drop in fuel prices and a 2% decline in used car prices. However, energy costs rose significantly (+9.8% for gas, +6.3% for electricity), and food prices increased by 2.9%, while airline fares surged 6.5% monthly. Despite these mixed signals, markets remain divided on the likelihood of Fed rate cuts. Futures data suggest only two or at most three rate cuts are priced in, less than what some political figures like Trump advocate. The article concludes that while long-term Treasuries may rise in value, holding them carries significant risk. As a result, the prevailing market advice is to favor short- and medium-term Treasuries (up to three years) and to hedge exposure via U.S. dollar-denominated accounts, as these low-duration bonds currently offer a 3.5% yield\u2014deemed substantial amid ongoing uncertainty.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 01:29 PM\nSource:[Money.it](https://www.money.it/bond-oggi-treasuries-usa-e-il-momento-di-vendere-o-di-comprare)\n\n**'Trump Re-election' One Year On: Dollar Value Drops 10% Amid 'Weak Dollar' Fallout Concerns**\nThe U.S. dollar, long considered a global safe-haven currency, is experiencing a significant decline in value, falling nearly 10% against major currencies since January 2024 following Donald Trump's second-term inauguration. This depreciation is attributed to the Trump administration's trade policies, geopolitical instability, and challenges to the Federal Reserve's independence, which have eroded global confidence in the dollar. The dollar index dropped 9.73% over the past year, reaching a 4-year low of 95.55 on February 27, 2026. Central banks worldwide have reduced their dollar holdings, with the share of dollar assets in global foreign exchange reserves falling from 72% in 1999 to 57% today, as countries increasingly favor Australian, Canadian, and Japanese currencies. U.S. Treasury bonds have also lost appeal, with market volatility triggered by Trump's reciprocal tariff announcements in April 2025. According to Bank of America, the 'run it hot' policy has led to a global shift toward 'Anything But Dollar' investing, with $104 billion flowing into European and Japanese equity funds in early 2026, compared to only $25 billion into U.S. funds. Gold prices surged 70% over the past year, with Deutsche Bank, Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 G\u00e9n\u00e9rale, and BNP Paribas forecasting gold reaching $6,000 per troy ounce by year-end. Trump has openly praised the weaker dollar, calling it 'excellent' for boosting exports, a stance echoed by Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick, who described the trend as 'more natural' for economic growth. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent maintains support for a strong dollar, but markets view this as a defensive statement. Analysts, including Richard Perry of State Street, predict that if Kevin Warsh, the newly nominated Fed Chair, takes office, the dollar could fall another 10% in 2026 due to aggressive rate cuts. While a weaker dollar may improve export competitiveness, Bloomberg warns that its impact on the U.S. economy is limited\u2014manufacturing now accounts for only 8% of employment, down from over 30% in the 1950s. Moreover, a weaker dollar could drive up import and raw material prices, fuel inflation, and pressure the Fed to raise interest rates, increasing mortgage and credit card costs. It may also hinder government fiscal expansion.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 12:30 PM\nSource:[\uc778\ud130\ub137\ub274\uc2a4 \ud55c\uacbd\ub2f7\ucef4](https://www.hankyung.com/article/202602167929i)\n\n**U.S. Treasury Yields Near 4.05%: Why No One Is Buying Yet?**\nOn February 16, 2026, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell to 4.051%, nearing the 240-minute Bollinger Band lower band at 4.046%, indicating a technically oversold condition but lacking clear stabilization signals. The yield decline since February 5 has been driven by holiday effects and a rebound in the U.S. dollar, which rose to 96.9589, retesting the 240-minute Bollinger Band middle band. The dollar's strength increases the currency cost for non-U.S. investors holding U.S. bonds, suppressing cross-border demand, especially with Asian investors absent due to the Lunar New Year holiday. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve officials signaled potential rate cuts, but highlighted persistent service sector inflation, leaving the March 18 meeting path uncertain. The market has largely priced in a hold, but further yield declines require stronger dovish signals. Technically, the 10-year yield remains below the 50-day moving average (4.184%) and MACD shows slight negative momentum contraction, suggesting limited upside for now. In contrast, gold has stabilized around $5,024.67, with MACD showing reduced negative momentum, and analysts have revised their medium-term target to $5,100\u2013$5,200. A key insight is the negative convenience yield of U.S. Treasuries relative to German bonds over the past 15 years, indicating market perception of higher risk in holding U.S. debt. This reflects growing concerns about U.S. fiscal risk, including potential impacts from illegal tariff legislation that could reduce annual revenue by $100\u2013$130 billion, further pressuring an already elevated fiscal deficit (5.8%\u20136.0%). With Asian markets still closed and U.S. markets resuming trading, yields are expected to oscillate between 4.046% and 4.136% in the near term. Key watchpoints include whether the dollar can sustain above 96.86 and test 97.10, and whether U.S. equity market strength draws capital from bonds. Despite underpricing of fiscal risk, short-term dynamics remain dominated by technical rebound attempts and low liquidity, with no trend reversal likely without a new catalyst.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 11:14 AM\nSource:[\u548c\u8baf\u5916\u6c47](http://forex.hexun.com/2026-02-16/223498984.html)\n\n**Carry Trades Unwind: Yen Strength Signals Shift in Global FX Positioning | Investing.com**\nThe article analyzes global foreign exchange (FX) market dynamics, highlighting a significant shift in positioning following the Liberal Democratic Party's (LDP) victory in Japan's February 8 election. Despite expectations of yen depreciation, the yen rallied strongly\u2014its largest weekly gain since November 2024\u2014indicating that carry trades involving the yen as a funding currency had already been unwound. The 10-year US Treasury yield fell nearly 15 basis points last week, the most in five months, dropping below 4.05%\u2014the lowest in over two months\u2014despite strong January US employment data. The market now fully discounts two Federal Reserve rate cuts in 2026 and assigns a 60% probability to a third. The US Dollar Index (DXY) remained range-bound between 96.50 and 97.25, with momentum indicators showing mixed signals. The euro traded within a narrow range (~$1.1810\u2013$1.1925), supported by its 20-day moving average (~$1.1840). The offshore yuan (CNH) held near CNH6.9065 due to the Lunar New Year closure, while the Japanese yen strengthened to a weekly high near JPY152.25, with potential support at JPY150.80. Sterling weakened slightly, closing below $1.3600, with technical support near $1.3600 and resistance at $1.3730. The Canadian dollar held near CAD1.3640, with a break above CAD1.3660 seen as bullish. The Australian dollar reached a three-year high near $0.7150 before pulling back to $0.7045, supported by strong correlations with gold and copper. In Latin America, the Mexican peso remained resilient against the dollar, with the carry trade adjustment already reflected. The US Supreme Court\u2019s upcoming decision on presidential emergency tariff powers is expected to be adverse to the administration, potentially weighing on US yields. The market remains sensitive to de-risking from US Treasuries by Chinese institutions. Key data releases include US January retail sales, CPI, and employment figures, alongside Japanese Q4 GDP, trade balance, and CPI, and Australian Q4 wage and employment data.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 07:07 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/carry-trades-unwind-yen-strength-signals-shift-in-global-fx-positioning-200675058)\n\n**US 10-year Treasury yield eases as inflation softens | Investing.com ZA**\nUS headline inflation eased to 2.40% in January 2026, the lowest level since May 2025 and below the 2.50% forecast, leading the 10-year Treasury yield to decline to 4.07%. Economists attributed much of the slowdown to base effects from last year\u2019s elevated readings. Markets now price in two additional interest rate cuts later in 2026. Equity futures recovered from early losses, but major indices closed mostly flat: the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were steady, while the Dow Jones lost 100 points, ending a 1.50% weekly decline amid ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) market volatility. Megacap tech and semiconductor stocks were pressured, with Nvidia down 2.20%, Apple 2.30%, Alphabet 1.10%, Meta 1.60%, and Broadcom 1.80%, while Oracle, Palantir, Microsoft, and Micron remained flat. In contrast, Salesforce rose 2.30%, and Applied Materials and Arista Networks surged 10% each on strong earnings, defying broader tech weakness. In energy, the US eased sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s oil and gas sector via two general licenses, enabling international firms to operate and attract new capital\u2014a significant shift since the removal of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro last month. Silver rose nearly 4% to $77.50 an ounce, recovering from Thursday\u2019s losses, while gold advanced toward $5,020 an ounce, reducing weekly losses. European shares dipped slightly: the STOXX 50 fell 0.40% to 5,987, and the STOXX 600 declined 0.10% to 617, marking two consecutive days of modest declines after a record high. Banks including UniCredit, Deutsche Bank, and BBVA dropped 3.50% to 4%, L'Or\u00e9al fell 5% on weak year-end sales despite earnings, and Herm\u00e8s dipped slightly despite beating profit forecasts; Safran surged 8.30% after raising its full-year outlook. Eurozone employment rose 0.30%, supporting expectations of stable European Central Bank (ECB) rates. In the UK, the FTSE 100 gained 0.30% after a 0.70% drop on Thursday, lifted by rebounds in AI-exposed and defence stocks\u2014RELX jumped 9%, and London Stock Exchange Group rose over 0.50%. Germany\u2019s DAX 40 rose 0.30%, ending a three-day decline on strength in defence, aerospace, and tech stocks. Asian markets closed mixed: Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index fell 0.90% to 27,032.54 amid pre-Lunar New Year light trading, with Lenovo down 4.60% and NetEase losing 4.10%; Alibaba Group edged 0.90% lower despite increasing its AI focus. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 ended nearly unchanged at 57,639.84 after briefly surpassing 58,000. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite rose 0.10% to 4,134.02. Locally, the South African rand weakened on Friday due to lower global commodity prices and stronger-than-expected US labor data, though early support emerged from precious metals. CNBC Africa noted that a sustained rebound in commodity prices could limit further rand depreciation. In political developments, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced plans to deploy the military to combat organized crime and to pursue legal action against municipal officials failing to deliver water services\u2014this favorable policy response boosted investor confidence in the rand.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:45 AM\nSource:[Investing.com South Africa](https://za.investing.com/analysis/us-10year-treasury-yield-eases-as-inflation-softens-200617362)\n\n**Yen Retreats After Strong Week, Dollar Holds Steady as Traders Weigh Interest Rate Outlook**\nThe Japanese yen weakened by 0.2% to 153.07 per US dollar in early Monday trading, reversing a nearly 3% weekly gain\u2014the largest weekly rise in about 15 months\u2014following Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi's decisive election victory. Brent Donnelly, founder of Spectra Markets, attributed the yen's strength to reduced uncertainty, which encouraged long-term investors to return, fueling what he called the 'Buy Japan' trade, as Japanese yields and the Nikkei also rose. However, weak economic growth\u2014only 0.2% annualized in Q4 2025\u2014could hinder the Bank of Japan (BOJ) from tightening monetary policy, with market odds of a rate hike in March set at 20%. OCBC maintains its forecast that the yen will reach 149 per dollar by end-2026, citing ongoing challenges in transitioning from a funding to an investment currency unless the BOJ becomes more aggressive than the expected two rate hikes this year. In the U.S., January inflation data showed softer-than-expected price growth, leading markets to price in a third rate cut, with futures implying 62 basis points of easing for the year and a 68% probability of a June cut. The U.S. dollar index held steady at 96.959, while the euro traded near 1.1863 and the pound dipped slightly to 1.3638. U.S. two-year Treasury yields hit their lowest level since 2022, and ten-year yields fell 4.8 basis points. The Swiss franc weakened to 0.7685, after gaining over 1% last week, as investors grew cautious about potential SNB intervention to curb its strength, with OCBC analysts warning that further gains could challenge the SNB\u2019s tolerance for appreciation, despite high barriers to returning to negative rates.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 02:21 AM\nSource:[de.marketscreener.com](https://de.marketscreener.com/boerse-nachrichten/yen-gibt-nach-starker-woche-nach-dollar-stabil-waehrend-haendler-zinsperspektiven-abwaegen-ce7e5ddbdf8ff72d)\n\n**Individual Investors Buy 348.3 Million EGP in Treasury Bills on Stock Exchange Sunday**\nOn Sunday, individual investors in Egypt purchased treasury bills worth 348.3 million EGP through the stock exchange, while selling bills worth 60.2 million EGP. Institutional investors sold treasury bills worth 7.5 billion EGP and purchased them for 7.2 billion EGP, resulting in a net selling of 288 million EGP. The total net purchases by individuals in treasury bills exceeded 288 million EGP. The stock exchange introduced the 'continuous trading' system (GFIT) for government treasury bills and bonds on Sunday, enabling individual investors to trade these instruments more freely in the secondary market. Raimond Nabil, a capital markets expert, stated that the new mechanism will increase trading volume and attract a new segment of fixed-income investors from banks who previously struggled to access these instruments. He noted that the performance of these instruments is influenced by interest rates and inflation, but their listing on the exchange is a new catalyst for market liquidity and long-term investor base growth. Omr El-Badry, Head of Technical Analysis at Mirage Securities, explained that fixed-income instruments, such as treasury bills (with maturity of one year or less) and bonds (with maturity exceeding one year), were previously traded only among large financial institutions and banks. He emphasized that allowing individual investors to trade these instruments will significantly boost market liquidity and offer relatively low-risk capital protection, though returns require time. He also noted that while these instruments may not immediately impact market liquidity due to investors' preference for short-term gains, they are designed to attract cautious, conservative investors, a segment currently underserved in the market.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 04:29 PM\nSource:[AL Masry Al Youm](https://www.almasryalyoum.com/news/details/4199876)\n\n**Spanish Treasury to Close February Auctions on February 19, 2026, with 55 Billion Euros in Financing Needs**\nThe Spanish Treasury will close its February 2026 debt auctions on Thursday, February 19, with a issuance of medium- and long-term debt, according to the schedule of the agency under the Ministry of Economy. This follows the European Central Bank's (ECB) decision to keep interest rates unchanged, maintaining the deposit facility rate (DFR) at 2.0%, the main refinancing rate (MRO) at 2.15%, and the marginal lending facility (MLF) at 2.40%. Banco de Espa\u00f1a Governor and ECB Council member Jos\u00e9 Luis Escriv\u00e1 stated that 'the best' course is to maintain current interest rates, though a reevaluation may be necessary if the international context remains 'complex.' On Thursday, the Treasury plans to issue: a 3-year and 3-month bond with a 3.50% coupon; a new 5-year benchmark bond with a 2.6% coupon; and a 10-year obligation with a 3.30% coupon. The Treasury forecasts new financing needs of 55,000 million euros for 2026, matching the 2025 figure. Of this, 50,000 million euros will be allocated to medium- and long-term debt (bonds, obligations, foreign currency debt, loans, and assumed debt), and 5,000 million euros to Treasury bills, consistent with 2025. Gross issuance is expected to reach 285.693 billion euros in 2026, a 4.2% increase from the projected 2025 closure of 274.242 billion euros, driven by higher amortizations. Specifically, gross medium- and long-term debt issuance is projected at 176.935 billion euros (a 3.1% increase from 2025\u2019s 171.514 billion euros), and Treasury bill issuance at 108.758 billion euros (a 5.9% increase from 2025\u2019s 102.728 billion euros). In 2025, the average maturity of Spanish debt remained around eight years for the fifth consecutive year, reaching 7.93 years\u2014the highest since 2021, when it was 7.99 years.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 08:16 AM\nSource:[europa press](https://www.europapress.es/economia/macroeconomia-00338/noticia-tesoro-cerrara-jueves-subastas-febrero-subastara-nueva-referencia-bonos-anos-20260215091611.html)\n\n**Brazilian Companies Race to Raise Dollars Abroad to Bypass Electoral Turmoil**\nBrazilian companies, banks, and the National Treasury have accelerated foreign debt issuance in the first 45 days of 2026, raising US$ 9.2 billion (R$ 47.8 billion), a 95% increase compared to the same period in 2025, when US$ 4.74 billion was raised. This surge is driven by strong international investor appetite for emerging markets like Brazil, higher domestic interest rates (15% annually), and the difficulty of financing in reais. The funds are being used for productive investments, debt restructuring, and prepaying upcoming foreign bonds. Analysts predict that 2026\u2019s foreign capital raises\u2014projected between US$ 25 billion and US$ 30 billion\u2014will be concentrated in the first half of the year due to electoral volatility in Brazil, with elections scheduled for October 2026. The National Treasury raised nearly US$ 4.5 billion in a bond issuance with maturities in 2036 and 2056, setting benchmarks for corporate issuers. Companies including Azul (US$ 1.38 billion), FS Bio (US$ 500 million), Sabesp (US$ 1.35 billion), Bradesco, and BTG Pactual (US$ 750 million) have recently tapped international markets. Market experts cite global trends such as 'Sell America'\u2014investors reducing exposure to U.S. assets\u2014and falling U.S. interest rates, which have made Brazilian bonds more attractive despite higher risk. The international market offers longer maturities and larger funding volumes than domestic markets. However, recent financial disclosures showing high corporate leverage have caused declines in secondary market prices, prompting caution among foreign investors. The Treasury plans to issue up to US$ 10 billion in foreign bonds in 2026, accounting for up to 7% of the Annual Financing Plan (PAF) for public debt, which totals R$ 1.67 trillion. Treasury bond issuances also help establish pricing benchmarks for private companies. According to analysts, 70%\u201380% of foreign capital raises typically occur in the first half of election years, and companies are accelerating issuance before the campaign intensifies in August.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 07:00 AM\nSource:[O Globo](https://oglobo.globo.com/economia/financas/noticia/2026/02/15/empresas-brasileiras-correm-para-captar-em-dolares-no-exterior-e-driblar-turbulencia-eleitoral.ghtml)\n\n**U.S. 1-Year Treasury Bill Yields Stabilize Near 3.49% Amid Shifting Fed Rate Expectations**\nThe yield on the U.S. 1-year Treasury bill stabilized at approximately 3.49 percent, following a volatile start to the week driven by strong labor market data. Despite higher-than-expected initial jobless claims of 227,000, which eased concerns about an overly restrictive Federal Reserve policy, the market remains focused on the timing of a potential rate cut. The probability of a rate cut in June 2026 has risen above 50 percent, with March 2026 now considered unlikely. The 10-year Treasury yield declined slightly to 4.168 percent, approaching a technical resistance level of 4.20 percent, while the yield curve remains inverted but with a narrowing spread between short- and long-term rates. Market participants are navigating a high supply of U.S. debt, with $125 billion in auctions this week, and are using the 1-year Treasury bill as a liquidity haven. Technically, the 3.49 percent level acts as a magnet, with the Relative Strength Index (RSI) at 50 indicating market neutrality. Resistance lies between 3.53% and 3.55%, while support is at 3.45%. A close below 3.45% would confirm a downward trend toward the annual low of 3.37%. The outcome of the 30-year Treasury auction at 13:00 EST (19:00 CET) will be pivotal, with weak demand potentially pushing yields up to 3.52% and strong demand supporting a drop to 3.47%.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 10:32 PM\nSource:[Aktien Check](https://www.aktiencheck.de/news/Artikel-U_S_1_Year_Treasury_Bill_Finanzkennzahlen_betrachtet-19468663)\n\n**273-Day Treasury Bill Tender Rates Drop to 1.256%, Banks Secure 98% of Issuance**\nThe Central Bank conducted a tender for NT$35 billion of 273-day Treasury bills on January 22, 2026, with a final discount rate of 1.256%, a decrease of 17 basis points from the previous auction in February 2025, which had a rate of 1.426%. The tender attracted NT$48.3 billion in bids, up from NT$44.2 billion in the prior auction, with the bid-to-cover ratio rising from 1.26 to 1.38. The weighted average winning discount rate was 1.233%. Bank participation dominated, with banks securing 98% of the issuance\u2014NT$343 billion\u2014while securities and insurance firms received nothing, and the brokerage sector captured 2% (NT$7 billion). Bank officials attributed the strong demand to a gradual global easing cycle, expected\u5bbd\u677e funding conditions in 2026, and a high level of liquidity in the domestic market, especially around the New Year and Lunar New Year periods. Despite the current high-interest-rate environment compared to pre-2022 levels, market liquidity remains relatively tight, and long-term instruments like 273-day Treasury bills are still primarily sought by banks due to limited alternative investment outlets. Although long-term Treasury bill demand is not yet strong, it is expected to rise significantly after the Central Bank implements rate cuts. The 273-day Treasury bill is issued annually, while the 364-day deposit notes are monitored monthly for broader market trends.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 11:02 PM\nSource:[\u5de5\u5546\u6642\u5831](https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20260123700173-430301)\n\n**FG N3.44trn T-bills' oversubscription highest in over one year - Businessday NG**\nThe Central Bank of Nigeria (CBN) recorded the highest oversubscription for Nigerian Treasury Bills (NTBs) in over a year during the primary auction on January 22, 2026, with total demand reaching N3.44 trillion against a government offer of N1.15 trillion. The 364-day tenor saw the strongest demand, with investors bidding four times the offered amount, though only N1.06 trillion was sold across all maturities. This level of demand last matched on December 4, 2024, during a period of high inflation and elevated interest rates. Since December 2025, subscription levels have consistently exceeded N1 trillion in primary auctions. Analysts at Meristem attribute the surge to investors seeking to capitalize on rising yields. Yields rose on short-term bills: the 91-day increased to 16.50% from 16.35% (implied), and the 182-day rose to 18.17% from 17.99%. The 364-day yield slightly declined to 22.49% from 22.65%. The surge is driven by aggressive government borrowing\u2014projected fiscal deficit of N23.85 trillion for FY2026\u2014and the CBN\u2019s tight monetary policy to combat inflation and stabilize the Naira. The government plans to raise N7.55 trillion in Q1 2026 alone, increasing supply and pushing yields higher. The CBN aims to attract Foreign Portfolio Investment (FPI) by maintaining yields above 22% on one-year bills. Analysts forecast yields between 18.0% and 20.0% for one-year NTBs in H1 2026. Experts recommend fund managers focus on short- to mid-term segments. Ayodeji Ebo of Optimus by Afrinvest stated that longer-dated bills still offer the best value. The yield increases are expected to impact the secondary market, where retail investors can access NTBs through platforms like Risevest, Cowrywise, Bamboo, Meritrade, and I-invest.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 08:41 AM\nSource:[Businessday NG](https://businessday.ng/business-economy/article/fg-n3-44trn-t-bills-oversubscription-highest-in-over-one-year/)\n\n**Bank Dominance in 182-Day Treasury Bill Auction as Yield Rises to 1.24%**\nThe Central Bank auctioned NT$35 billion in 182-day treasury bills on January 13, 2026, under the commission of the Ministry of Finance. The final discount rate was set at 1.24%, up 2.5 basis points from the previous 1.215% in December 2025, exceeding market expectations of 1.21%\u20131.22%. The auction attracted NT$51.007 billion in bidding, down from NT$42.6 billion in the prior period, resulting in a bid-to-cover ratio of 1.46, down from 1.75. All 350 billion NT$ in treasury bills were won by banks, with securities firms and insurance companies absent from bidding, and the securities industry securing only 2.86% in the previous auction. Market uncertainty\u2014driven by U.S. Federal Reserve independence concerns, the upcoming appointment of a new Fed chair, a pending U.S. court ruling on Trump\u2019s tariffs, and expectations of unchanged domestic interest rates through the first half of 2026\u2014led financial institutions to adopt a cautious stance. Banks, anticipating limited need to deploy funds early, held back on bidding. Additionally, the Central Bank\u2019s recent increase in daily issuance of 28-day time deposits absorbed short-term liquidity, further reducing urgency to invest in longer-term 182-day treasury bills. Despite stable market conditions and the expectation that rates would remain flat, the final rate rose to 1.24%, reflecting investor reluctance to commit to long-term instruments amid uncertainty.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 11:24 PM\nSource:[\u5de5\u5546\u6642\u5831](https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20260114700152-430301)\n\n**364-Day Treasury Bills: Year-End Funding Bidding Heats Up**\nThe Central Bank of Taiwan auctioned NT$35 billion in 364-day treasury bills on December 16, 2025, on behalf of the Ministry of Finance. The winning discount rate was 1.219%, a significant decrease of 23.6 basis points (0.01 percentage points) compared to the 1.455% rate from the same maturity auction on December 27, 2024. This rate, which falls within the market's expected range of 1.215% to 1.44%, is the second-highest level since the 2008 financial crisis. The auction attracted NT$89.8 billion in bidding, up from NT$82.5 billion in the previous auction, resulting in a bid-to-cover ratio of 2.57, indicating sustained strong interest. All NT$35 billion was taken by banks, with securities, brokerage, and insurance firms not participating. Bank officials attributed the lower rate to abundant liquidity due to foreign capital inflows, which strengthened the New Taiwan dollar and eased short-term funding pressures. Despite the current low rate, market analysts expect no further rate cuts in Taiwan until the end of next year, citing strong economic growth, robust exports, and the U.S. Federal Reserve signaling a slowdown in rate cuts after three cuts in 2024. The 364-day treasury bill rate has risen sharply since 2022, following the Central Bank's rate hikes to combat inflation, with the latest rate hike in March 2024. After six consecutive quarters of unchanged policy rates, the treasury bill rate has stabilized and slightly declined.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 16, 2025 11:41 PM\nSource:[\u5de5\u5546\u6642\u5831](https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20251217700160-430301)\n\n**How to beat inflation over the next year in one investing move**\nShort-term interest rates remain elevated, creating an investment opportunity in 1-year Treasury bills, according to MarketWatch. Even after a projected 25 basis point (0.25%) rate cut by the Federal Reserve in December 2025, rates will still be too high relative to expected inflation. A full 1 percentage point reduction would be needed to align the 1-year Treasury bill rate (BX:TMUBMUSD01Y) with its long-term average. The topic is politically charged: former President Donald Trump has pressured Fed Chair Jerome Powell to cut rates drastically, even threatening to fire him, and is expected to nominate a more compliant successor\u2014though excessive compliance risks undermining the Fed\u2019s independence. Meanwhile, progressive figures like Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren have also called for rate cuts, arguing that current rates are too high.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 08, 2025 01:15 PM\nSource:[MarketWatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-to-beat-inflation-over-the-next-year-in-one-investing-move-2d51f3f7)\n\n**Treasury Bill Demand Surges Following Policy Rate Cut**\nGhana's money market saw a sharp rebound in demand for Treasury bills following the Bank of Ghana's (BoG) 350 basis point policy rate cut to 18 percent, announced at the 127th Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meeting. At the latest auction, the government raised GH\u00a25.78 billion, more than double its GH\u00a22.86 billion target, with yields on 91-day, 182-day, and 364-day bills falling by an average of 10 basis points. This oversubscription follows weeks of undersubscribed auctions, attributed to reduced investor appetite due to competition from higher-return alternative investments. Fincap Securities noted that the rate cut triggered a strong liquidity response, with investors rotating into government bills as yields declined. The cumulative rate cuts this year total 1,000 basis points, driven by improved inflation dynamics, a stable currency, and stronger economic indicators. Governor Dr. Johnson Pandit Asiama confirmed that headline inflation has eased to the BoG\u2019s 8 percent central target for the first time since 2021. Despite strong primary market performance, secondary market trading weakened, dropping 33.77 percent to GH\u00a21.84 billion, with investors holding positions rather than selling. Activity in older bonds fell 8.54 percent. Curve dynamics shifted, with strong demand for 2027\u20132029 bonds (trading at 14.50\u201314.70 percent) and emerging interest in 2038s at around 16 percent, signaling a gradual return of confidence in longer maturities. Constant Capital expects continued momentum, supported by an accommodative policy stance and sustained bidding across short to mid-term bonds. Apakan Securities stated the rate cut aligns with expectations and that inflation is likely to remain within the 8% \u00b12% target through year-end, leaving room for further easing in 2026 if trends continue. The BoG also announced a return to the 14-day bill as its primary open market instrument, a move described by Dr. Asiama as a 'reset' to improve liquidity management and strengthen monetary policy transmission. The Treasury\u2019s increased target for the upcoming week\u2014GH\u00a25.81 billion\u2014indicates continued reliance on short-term domestic financing, with officials signaling a careful approach to future Eurobond re-entry. Analysts anticipate that lower policy rates will eventually reduce borrowing costs for businesses and households, though full transmission to commercial lending typically takes several months. The developments reflect improved macroeconomic fundamentals but underscore the need for sustained fiscal discipline to maintain investor confidence.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 01:36 PM\nSource:[News Ghana](https://www.newsghana.com.gh/treasury-bill-demand-surges-following-policy-rate-cut/)\n\n**Money market report for the week ended October 31, 2025**\nOn October 30, 2025, the European Central Bank (ECB) Governing Council decided to maintain the three key interest rates unchanged: the deposit facility rate at 2.00%, the main refinancing operations (MRO) rate at 2.15%, and the marginal lending facility rate at 2.40%. Inflation remains close to the 2% medium-term target, and the council's outlook is broadly unchanged, despite ongoing global trade disputes and geopolitical tensions. The ECB emphasized a data-dependent, meeting-by-meeting approach to monetary policy, with no pre-commitment to a specific rate path. The Asset Purchase Programme and Pandemic Emergency Purchase Programme portfolios continue to decline predictably, as the Eurosystem no longer reinvests principal payments from maturing securities. The Transmission Protection Instrument (TPI) remains available to counter disorderly market dynamics threatening monetary policy transmission. On October 28, the ECB conducted a seven-day MRO attracting \u20ac13,515.60 million in bids\u2014\u20ac2,460.10 million more than the previous week\u2014with full allotment at 2.15%. A three-month longer-term refinancing operation also attracted \u20ac2,462.20 million in bids, with full allotment at the average MRO rate over the operation's life. On October 29, a seven-day USD funding operation with the US Federal Reserve attracted $85.50 million in bids, allotted in full at 4.10%. In the domestic market, the Treasury issued 91-day and 273-day bills with \u20ac25.21 million and \u20ac47.47 million in bids, respectively; all 91-day bids were accepted, and \u20ac42.47 million of the 273-day bids were accepted. With \u20ac32.28 million in bills maturing, the outstanding Treasury bill balance rose to \u20ac648.68 million. The 91-day bill yield was 1.985% (up 1.60 basis points from October 23), with a bid price of \u20ac99.5007 per \u20ac100 nominal. The 273-day bill yield was 1.981% (up 2.80 basis points from July 10, 2025), with a bid price of \u20ac98.5200 per \u20ac100 nominal. Secondary market turnover in Malta Government Treasury bills totaled \u20ac732,000, including \u20ac602,000 on the on-exchange market and \u20ac130,000 on the off-exchange market.
