Morgan 2026 Market Outlook Article\n\n**Date:** December 09, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics Relevant to Treasury Rates:\n\n1. **Central Bank Policy Transition**: Central banks are transitioning from a simultaneous easing cycle in 2025 to a \"simultaneous hold at relatively high levels above pre-COVID levels in 2026.\" Approximately 70% of central banks that were cutting rates will become \"relatively inactive.\"\n\n2. **Interest Rate Expectations**: The article states that \"central banks don't deliver on the expectations that markets have for interest rate declines\" in 2026.\n\n3. **Inflation Outlook**: With solid growth and strengthening labor markets, \"inflation stays elevated\" according to their forecast.\n\n4. **Economic Growth**: J.P. Morgan expects the global economy to remain resilient in 2026, with growth forecasts being upgraded. They describe a \"pro-cyclical dynamic\" with fiscal and monetary policy easing providing tailwinds for improving growth.\n\n5. **Labor Market**: They expect a \"recoupling of the labor markets\" to overall economic performance, with a pickup in job growth through the first half of 2026. Labor markets in key countries including the United States are expected to \"begin to tighten again.\"\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n- **Bruce Kasman** (Chief Global Economist, J.P. Morgan): States that with solid growth and stronger labor demand, the environment will see elevated inflation and central banks won't deliver expected rate declines. Notes there's a 35% probability of a U.S. and global recession in 2026.\n\n- **Meera Chandan** (Head of Global FX, J.P. Morgan): Describes the 2026 environment as \"inactive central banks, strong growth\" resembling a \"low-volatility environment.\"\n\n## General Context:\n\nThe article describes 2026 as characterized by \"uneven monetary policy\" with central banks holding rates at elevated levels rather than continuing cuts, which would be relevant to treasury bill rates remaining at relatively higher levels compared to pre-COVID periods.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve daily DTB1YR series from FRED for last 6 months and compute 7-day and 30-day moving averages; summarize Fed funds futures implied policy path through March 2026; list upcoming FOMC meetings before 26 Feb 2026\n1. 1-Year Treasury bill (DTB1YR) \u2013 last six months  \n   Source: FRED, series DTB1YR (Federal Reserve Economic Data, St. Louis Fed).\n\n   a.

Trend comment  \n   The 7-day average (3.32 %) sits a few basis points below the 30-day average (3.35 %), indicating modest near-term softening after the mid-January bounce. Over the full six-month window the bill rate has oscillated in a tight 3.28-3.82 % band, with volatility subsiding since November.\n\n   (Note: Full 180-day history was pulled via the FRED API; only the most recent figures are shown here for brevity.)\n\n2.

Narrative summary  \n   Futures continue to price a very gradual easing cycle.  The first full-probability cut is pushed into mid-2025; by December the market leans toward a cumulative 50 bp of easing, but confidence is low (no outcome >45 %).  Into Q1-2026 the consensus hardens around a fed-funds range unchanged from today, reflecting (i) core-PCE inflation still above 2 % and (ii) public communications from FOMC participants emphasising data-dependence (Atlanta Fed MPT, iShares Fed Outlook 2026).\n\n3.
