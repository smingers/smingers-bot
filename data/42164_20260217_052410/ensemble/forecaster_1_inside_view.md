## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- None. No official retirement announcements, no federal court-expansion bills introduced, no confirmed health crises.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Alito book timing (October 2026)**: Multiple sources note this as unusual. Expert Steve Vladeck calls it "a pretty big tell." However, expert David Lat offers counter-interpretation that current justices attract more book buyers. **Directional signal**: Weak-to-moderate evidence for retirement, but conflicting expert interpretations reduce strength.

2. **Legal journalist prediction (Jan 14, 2026)**: Federal courts expert explicitly states "No Supreme Court justices are expected to retire in 2026" with Thomas and Alito "active and healthy." This is recent (1 month old) and from credible source. **Directional signal**: Evidence against composition change.

3. **Vox prediction (Jan 1, 2026)**: Forecasts Alito retirement likely before end of 2026. **Directional signal**: Evidence for composition change, but now 1.5 months old.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. Kalshi betting odds (40% for Thomas retirement during Trump term) - volatile and non-specific timeframe
2. Trump statements against retirement - political posturing
3. Various opinion pieces speculating on retirement - not expert analysis
4. Historical 34% vacancy rate - already incorporated in base rate

**Critical Assessment**: The evidence is contradictory. Alito book timing generates speculation, but a credible legal journalist with federal courts expertise explicitly predicted no retirements in 2026 just one month ago. No concrete developments (announcements, legislation, health news) have occurred.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 12 days (Feb 17-28, 2026)

This is an extremely short window. The question asks whether the Metaculus community prediction will rise above 23.00% by Feb 28.

**If timeframe halved (6 days)**: Probability would drop to ~15-20%. Even less time for new information to emerge.

**If timeframe doubled (24 days)**: Probability would rise to ~35-40%. More opportunity for new developments or amplified speculation.

**Key consideration**: The 23.00% reading on Feb 16 already incorporates the Alito speculation from Feb 6-14. The community has processed this information. For the prediction to rise, new information must emerge in the next 12 days.

## (d) Justification

**Factors supporting increase above 23.00%:**
1. Alito book timing continues generating media attention (weak-moderate)
2. New concrete development emerges: official announcement, health news, or legislation (low probability in 12 days, but high impact if occurs)
3. Additional expert commentary amplifying retirement likelihood (weak)

**Factors supporting stability or decline:**
1. Legal journalist expert prediction (Jan 14) of no 2026 retirements (moderate)
2. No concrete developments despite weeks of speculation (moderate)
3. Information already "priced in" to 23.00% (strong)
4. Short timeframe limits probability of new developments (strong)
5. Trump's public opposition to retirements (weak)
6. Historical pattern: speculation without confirmation tends to fade (moderate)

**Critical shift from outside view**: The outside view of 29% was based on general possibility of new developments. However, the Jan 14, 2026 expert prediction from a federal courts specialist explicitly stating no retirements expected in 2026 is significant countervailing evidence. This expert would have access to similar information about book timing and strategic considerations, yet concluded no retirements likely.

The question requires the prediction to exceed 23.00%, not merely equal it. Given:
- 12-day window
- Speculation already incorporated
- Expert prediction against retirements
- No concrete developments yet

The probability of the community prediction rising above 23.00% should be lower than the outside view base rate.

## Probability Calibration

**Status quo outcome**: Community prediction remains at or slightly below 23.00% absent new information. This is the most likely scenario.

**Probability of increase above 23.00%**: 
- New concrete development (15% probability it occurs × 90% probability it raises prediction = 13.5%)
- Amplified speculation without concrete news (10% probability × 60% probability it raises prediction = 6%)
- Random drift upward (5%)

**Total probability**: ~24-25%

However, considering the expert prediction from Jan 14 explicitly forecasting no retirements, and the efficient market hypothesis for Metaculus predictions, I adjust downward to account for the community's likely incorporation of similar expert analysis.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Metaculus community prediction for "US Supreme Court composition change in 2026" exceed 23.00% on Feb 28, 2026? Current: 23.00% on Feb 16.

2. **Outside view base rate**: 29% (established from general probability of new developments in 12-day window)

3. **Consistency check**: "22 out of 100 times, the Metaculus community prediction rises above 23.00% by Feb 28." This aligns with my assessment that speculation is already priced in and new concrete developments are unlikely in 12 days.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Legal journalist expert (Jan 14): "No retirements expected in 2026" - reduces probability
   - Alito book timing (October 2026) - weak-moderate evidence for retirement, but conflicting interpretations
   - No concrete developments despite weeks of speculation - supports stability
   - 12-day timeframe limits new information emergence - supports stability
   - Current 23.00% already incorporates recent speculation - supports stability

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Alito or Thomas announces retirement in next 12 days due to undisclosed health issue or strategic calculation. This would make prediction look silly. However, probability is low (~10-15%) and would shift forecast to ~60-70%.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Prediction remains at 23.00% or declines slightly. World changes slowly; absent concrete news, community predictions tend toward stability. Short 12-day window reinforces status quo likelihood.

**Final adjustment**: My analysis suggests the probability is lower than the outside view base rate of 29%, primarily due to the expert prediction against retirements and the short timeframe with information already incorporated. I calibrate to 22%.

Probability: 22%
