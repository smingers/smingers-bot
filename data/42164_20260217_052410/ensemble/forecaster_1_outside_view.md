Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles:**

1. **Guttmacher Institute (May 2024)**: Background on abortion bans post-Dobbs. Factual but not directly relevant to Supreme Court composition changes. High-quality research organization.

2. **USA TODAY (Feb 16, 2026)**: Reports speculation about Alito's potential retirement. Key facts: Alito is 76, book coming in October 2026. Named expert opinions from Melissa Murray, Kate Shaw, Steve Vladeck, David Lat, and Bruce Mehlman. Mixed signals on whether October book date indicates retirement or staying. High-quality mainstream source, but primarily speculative.

3. **The Nation (Feb 6, 2026)**: Opinion piece by Dario Castillejos arguing Alito's October book date suggests July 2026 retirement. Author's speculation rather than expert analysis. Left-leaning opinion source.

4. **Slate (Feb 13, 2026)**: Opinion by Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern suggesting Alito is preparing to retire based on media activity and book publication. Discusses potential successors (Emil Bove, Andy Oldham). Left-leaning opinion source with legal expertise.

5. **SCOTUSblog articles (Sept 2025, April 2025, Jan 2026)**: High-quality legal analysis but focus on case law and Trump administration litigation patterns. No information about composition changes. The Jan 2026 article notes heavy case volume but no retirement signals.

**Agent Report:**
- Confirms single data point: 23.00% on Feb 16, 2026
- Identifies key news events: Nation article (Feb 6), Slate article (Feb 13), Utah court expansion (Jan 30-31)
- Notes lack of official retirement announcements or federal court-expansion bills
- Acknowledges missing daily time-series data

**Key Factual Information:**
- Current community prediction: 23.00% as of Feb 16, 2026
- No official retirement announcements
- No federal court-expansion legislation introduced
- Speculation centered on Alito (age 76) due to book timing
- Historical base rate: 34% of years since 1970 had a Supreme Court vacancy

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Historical Supreme Court vacancy rate (1970-present)**: 34% of years had vacancies. However, this includes all types of departures and doesn't account for strategic timing considerations.

2. **Metaculus community prediction stability over short periods**: Community predictions on political questions typically show moderate volatility (±5-10 percentage points) in response to news, but rarely dramatic swings absent concrete developments.

3. **Impact of retirement speculation vs. actual announcements**: Speculation alone typically produces modest probability increases (2-4 percentage points), while official announcements cause large jumps (20-30+ percentage points).

4. **Mid-term election year dynamics**: In election years, justices considering strategic retirement typically announce by late spring/early summer to allow confirmation before midterms. We're in mid-February with no announcements yet.

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: Metaculus community prediction stability over 12-day periods in response to speculation (not official news). This directly addresses the question of whether the prediction will rise above 23.00% by Feb 28.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe**: 12 days (Feb 17 to Feb 28, 2026)

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**
- The question opened Feb 17, 2026 at 23.00%
- Major speculation articles appeared Feb 6 and Feb 13 (before question opening)
- By Feb 16, the community had already processed this speculation and settled at 23.00%
- No new concrete developments reported between Feb 13-16

**Key Observation**: The community prediction of 23.00% already reflects the Alito retirement speculation from early-mid February. The speculation is now "priced in."

## (d) Justification

The question asks whether the community prediction will be **higher than 23.00%** on Feb 28, requiring movement in the next 12 days.

**Factors favoring stability or decline:**
1. The major speculation (Alito retirement rumors) occurred Feb 6-13, before the current 23.00% reading
2. No official announcements have been made
3. Historical pattern: speculation without confirmation tends to fade
4. Time until resolution (11 months remaining in 2026) allows for mean reversion
5. The 23.00% figure is already above the historical base rate of ~20-25% for a single year

**Factors favoring increase:**
1. New concrete developments (official retirement announcement, health news, court-expansion bill introduction)
2. Additional media speculation building on existing rumors
3. Political developments increasing retirement likelihood

**Critical Assessment**: 
- For the prediction to rise above 23.00%, new information must emerge in the next 12 days
- The probability of significant new developments in a 12-day window is relatively low
- Metaculus communities tend to be efficient at incorporating available information
- The current 23.00% already represents elevated probability due to recent speculation

Outside view calibration:

The current 23.00% prediction already incorporates the Alito retirement speculation that dominated early-mid February news. For the prediction to rise meaningfully above this level by Feb 28, we would need:

1. **New concrete information** (probability ~15-20%): Official retirement announcement, serious health news, or court-expansion bill introduction
2. **Amplified speculation** (probability ~10-15%): Additional high-profile media coverage building momentum
3. **No new information leading to increase** (probability ~5%): Random drift upward

Conversely, absent new information, the prediction could:
- **Remain stable** (probability ~40-50%): Community maintains current assessment
- **Decline slightly** (probability ~20-25%): Speculation fades, mean reversion toward base rate

The question requires the prediction to be **strictly greater than 23.00%**, not equal. This is a high bar given:
- Short timeframe (12 days)
- Information already priced in
- No concrete developments yet
- Natural tendency toward stability absent new information

Historical upset rate in political forecasting: Approximately 15-25% of predictions are significantly wrong due to unexpected developments. However, short-term stability predictions (will X remain roughly constant over 12 days) have higher accuracy.

My calibrated assessment: The probability that the community prediction rises above 23.00% by Feb 28 is approximately 25-35%, accounting for the possibility of new concrete developments or amplified speculation, but recognizing that the current level already reflects available information.
