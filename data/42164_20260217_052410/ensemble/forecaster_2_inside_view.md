Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources on Alito/Thomas Retirement Speculation:**

1. **USA Today/AOL (Feb 16, 2026)** - High-quality mainstream journalism. Facts: Alito is 76, served 20 years, average retirement age is 79, book coming October 2026. Expert opinions from identifiable law professors (Melissa Murray, Kate Shaw, Steve Vladeck, David Lat, Bruce Mehlman) with clear reasoning about timing implications. Very recent and credible.

2. **The Nation (Feb 6, 2026)** - Opinion piece by Dario Castillejos. Single hard fact: October 6 book date. Rest is speculation about retirement timing based on book release patterns. Moderate quality for facts, low for predictive value.

3. **Above the Law (Feb 14, 2026)** - Legal blog noting retirement speculation based on book timing. No new facts beyond October 6 date. Weak evidentiary value.

4. **Newsweek (date unclear, appears older)** - Reports Kalshi betting odds at 40% for Thomas retirement during Trump term (down from 67% at inauguration). Includes Trump's statement that Thomas/Alito should "absolutely not" step down. Moderate quality but possibly outdated.

5. **ABC News (older article)** - Thomas at 70 (now 77) stated "I'm not retiring" and implied serving until death. Historical context only; circumstances may have changed significantly.

**Other Sources:**

6. **James Carville predictions (Nov 7, 2025; Feb 16, 2026)** - Political pundit predicting Democratic sweep in 2028 and court expansion. Pure speculation with no evidentiary basis. Carville's track record includes failed 2024 prediction. Weak evidence.

7. **Vox predictions (Jan 1, 2026)** - Forecasting article gives 70% probability Alito retires before end of 2026 due to midterm risk. Expert opinion but speculative. Moderate evidence.

8. **"It Won't Be Boring" legal predictions (Jan 14, 2026)** - Legal journalist predicts NO Supreme Court retirements in 2026, citing Thomas and Alito remaining "active and healthy." Contradicts other sources. Moderate evidence from domain expert.

9. **Marketing, currency, Spanish politics, Indian Supreme Court, Virginia redistricting articles** - Not relevant to U.S. Supreme Court composition changes.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- None. No confirmations of actual retirement plans or court-expansion legislation.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Multiple expert opinions (Murray, Shaw, Vladeck) suggesting Alito's October book timing is unusual and *could* signal retirement plans (but book promotion argument cuts both ways per David Lat)
- Vox's 70% prediction for Alito retirement by end-2026 represents informed forecaster opinion
- Legal journalist's contrary prediction (NO retirements) based on health/activity assessment
- Trump's public statement against retirements (moderate weight - could influence justices but doesn't bind them)

**Weak Evidence:**
- Kalshi betting odds showing declining retirement probability
- Historical patterns of 20-year service being "good milestone"
- Carville's court-packing speculation (no legislative momentum evident)
- Thomas's 2019 statements about not retiring (dated, circumstances changed)

**Key Insight:** The evidence is contradictory. Book timing speculation is circumstantial and experts disagree on its implications. No concrete indicators of imminent retirement or legislation.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window:** 11.6 days (Feb 17 to Feb 28, 2026 at 19:08 UTC)

**Critical Constraint:** This question asks whether the Metaculus community prediction will be >23% on Feb 28, NOT whether a composition change will actually occur in 2026. The meta-question has much shorter horizon than the underlying event.

**If timeframe halved (6 days):** Probability would drop to ~48% - less time for news to emerge, stronger mean-reversion effect.

**If timeframe doubled (23 days):** Probability would rise to ~58% - more opportunity for rumor cycles, news leaks, or clarifying statements.

## (d) Justification

**Starting Point:** Outside view established 52% based on:
- Random walk volatility (σ ≈ 0.7pp/day → ±2.3pp over 11 days)
- Slight downward drift from mean-reversion
- Low probability of major news in short window

**Current Factors Shifting Prediction:**

*Upward pressure (+3-4%):*
- The Alito book timing speculation has already been widely discussed (USA Today, The Nation, Above the Law) in past 10 days, yet community prediction remains at 23%. This suggests forecasters have *already priced in* this information without moving significantly upward.
- Vox's 70% year-end prediction creates slight upward pull on shorter-term probabilities
- Senate control urgency (midterms in November) creates strategic retirement window

*Downward pressure (-3-4%):*
- Legal journalist's explicit "NO retirements in 2026" prediction from credible domain expert
- Trump's public opposition to retirements (though limited binding effect)
- Thomas's historical statements and both justices' apparent health/activity
- Contradictory expert interpretations of book timing (Lat's counter-argument that current justices are more marketable)
- No concrete evidence of retirement planning or court-expansion legislation
- The fact that extensive media speculation hasn't moved the needle suggests forecasters are skeptical

**Net Effect:** Contradictory moderate evidence roughly cancels out. The key insight is that despite 10+ days of retirement speculation in mainstream media, the community prediction has remained stable at 23%. This stability suggests:
1. Forecasters have absorbed the book-timing argument and found it unpersuasive
2. Absence of harder evidence (leaks, health concerns, legislative activity) keeps probability anchored
3. The meta-question's short 11-day window limits upside from speculative factors

**Adjustment:** The outside view's 52% already accounts for typical volatility and rumor effects. Current information doesn't provide strong enough evidence to justify significant deviation. If anything, the stability at 23% despite media attention suggests slight downward revision.

## Probability Calibration

The outside view of 52% was mechanically sound but may have slightly overweighted the probability of news emergence in 11 days. The actual information landscape shows:

- Speculation is already public and priced in
- Expert opinions are divided
- No hard evidence of imminent changes
- Community prediction has been stable despite media coverage

Given the meta-question structure (will CP be >23% in 11 days, not will change occur in 2026), and the demonstrated stability of the prediction despite speculation, I adjust slightly downward to account for:
- Proven resistance to rumor-driven volatility
- Short timeframe limiting news emergence probability
- Mean-reversion tendency in absence of hard news

**Final calibration: 49%**

This represents essentially a coin-flip with slight downward bias, appropriate for a situation where:
- Random walk volatility dominates (±2.3pp expected)
- Current level (23%) is near the threshold
- No strong directional signals in evidence
- Slight mean-reversion pressure exists

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Metaculus community prediction for "US Supreme Court composition change in 2026" exceed 23% on Feb 28, 2026? (11.6 days from now)

2. **Base rate:** Outside view established 52% based on random-walk volatility over 11 days with slight downward drift.

3. **Consistency:** "49 out of 100 times, the community prediction exceeds 23% on Feb 28." This aligns with near-random movement around current level with slight downward pressure.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Media speculation about Alito book timing already public, prediction stable at 23%
   - Expert opinions contradictory (some predict retirement, others predict none)
   - No concrete evidence of retirement plans or court legislation
   - 11-day window limits probability of major news emergence
   - Historical volatility suggests ±2-3pp typical movement

5. **Blind spot:** A credible leak or health scare for Thomas/Alito in next 11 days would spike prediction to 40%+, making 49% look too conservative. However, probability of such event in 11 days is ~5-8%, already somewhat incorporated.

6. **Status quo:** Current 23% has been stable despite speculation. In absence of new hard evidence, slight mean-reversion toward 22% is most likely outcome over 11 days, supporting sub-50% probability.

Probability: 49%
