Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

**Guttmacher Institute (May 2024)**: Background on abortion bans post-Dobbs. Factual but not directly relevant to SCOTUS composition changes. High quality source for abortion policy but dated and off-topic.

**USA TODAY (Feb 16, 2026)**: Reports speculation about Alito's potential retirement. Key facts: Alito is 76 in April 2026, has a book coming out in October 2026. Contains expert opinions from named legal scholars (Melissa Murray, Kate Shaw, Steve Vladeck, David Lat, Bruce Mehlman) about retirement timing and book publication signals. High quality mainstream source, published one day before the question opens. Mix of facts (book date, ages) and expert speculation.

**The Nation (Feb 6, 2026)**: Opinion piece by Dario Castillejos speculating Alito will retire based on October 2026 book date. Factual element: book publication date. Rest is author's speculation. Medium quality opinion source, recent and relevant.

**Slate (Feb 13, 2026)**: Opinion piece by Dahlia Lithwick and Mark Joseph Stern speculating on Alito retirement based on media activity and upcoming biography. Contains expert opinions on potential successors (Emil Bove, Andy Oldham). High quality legal commentary source, very recent (4 days before question opens), but primarily speculative.

**SCOTUSblog (Sept 2, 2025)**: Analysis of shadow docket procedures. No information about composition changes. High quality but irrelevant to this question.

**SCOTUSblog (April 2, 2025)**: Case summary of Planned Parenthood dispute. No information about composition changes. High quality but irrelevant.

**SCOTUSblog (Jan 5, 2026)**: Year-in-review by Erwin Chemerinsky. Contains voting pattern statistics but no information about retirements or composition changes. High quality but not directly relevant.

**Agent Report**: Confirms community prediction was 23.00% on Feb 16, 2026. Identifies key news events: Nation article (Feb 6), Slate article (Feb 13), Utah court expansion (Jan 30-31). Notes lack of official retirement announcements or federal court-expansion bills. The agent correctly identifies that the most relevant events are the Alito retirement speculation stories in early-mid February 2026.

(b) Reference class analysis:

**Reference Class 1: Historical SCOTUS vacancy rates**
- Background states 34% of years since 1970 have had a SCOTUS vacancy
- Suitability: Moderate. This gives a baseline annual probability but doesn't account for current specific circumstances (ages of justices, political incentives for strategic retirement)

**Reference Class 2: Metaculus community prediction movements on similar questions**
- Agent report suggests "prior probability jumps of 2-4 percentage points" when retirement rumors emerge
- Suitability: High. This directly addresses how the Metaculus community typically reacts to retirement speculation

**Reference Class 3: Strategic retirement patterns during favorable political windows**
- Multiple sources note the political incentive for Alito (and Thomas) to retire while Republicans control Senate
- Historical pattern: Justices often retire strategically (referenced: RBG not retiring, leading to ideological replacement)
- Suitability: High. This is the core dynamic driving current speculation

**Most suitable reference class**: Combination of Classes 2 and 3 - how Metaculus community responds to credible strategic retirement speculation.

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Prediction timeframe**: 12 days (from Feb 17 to Feb 28, 2026)

**Current situation as of Feb 17, 2026**:
- Community prediction is at 23.00% (the exact threshold)
- Two major national stories about Alito retirement speculation appeared in the past 11 days (Feb 6 and Feb 13)
- No official retirement announcement has been made
- No court-expansion legislation has been introduced

**Key temporal factors**:
- The question asks if CP will be HIGHER than 23.00% on Feb 28
- We're only 12 days out from resolution
- The Alito speculation stories are very recent (4-11 days old)
- Typical Supreme Court retirement announcements come in spring (March-May) for end-of-term departures
- The 2026 midterms are ~9 months away, creating urgency for strategic retirements

**Historical patterns over similar short periods**:
- Agent report suggests Metaculus community typically reacts with 2-4 percentage point increases to retirement speculation
- However, the current CP is already at 23%, suggesting the community may have already partially priced in the Alito speculation
- Short timeframes (12 days) typically show modest movements unless major news breaks

(d) Justification:

The question asks whether the community prediction will rise above 23.00% by Feb 28, 2026 - just 12 days away.

**Factors supporting increase above 23%**:
1. Recent credible speculation: Two major national outlets (The Nation, Slate) published pieces in the past 11 days suggesting Alito may retire, with specific reasoning (October book date, strategic timing before midterms)
2. Expert opinions: Multiple named legal experts (Murray, Shaw, Vladeck) have publicly speculated about retirement timing
3. Political logic is sound: Republicans control Senate now, uncertain after Nov 2026 midterms
4. Alito is 76, at a reasonable retirement age
5. The speculation is fresh - community may still be processing and adjusting forecasts upward

**Factors supporting staying at or below 23%**:
1. No official announcement or concrete signal beyond book timing
2. The CP is already at 23%, suggesting the community has already incorporated the speculation
3. Only 12 days remain - limited time for further movement unless major news breaks
4. The book date (October 2026) could equally signal Alito is staying (as David Lat suggested)
5. Historical base rate (34% annual vacancy rate) translates to roughly 23% for remaining 10.5 months of 2026, which is where CP currently sits

**Critical insight from Agent Report**: The agent notes that typical Metaculus reactions to retirement rumors are 2-4 percentage point increases. If the CP was at 19-21% before the Feb 6-13 speculation stories, it may have already jumped to the current 23%. This suggests the market has already priced in the speculation.

The question is whether additional information will emerge in the next 12 days to push it higher. Possible catalysts:
- Additional reporting with new sources
- More explicit signals from Alito
- Other justices showing retirement signals
- Court-expansion bill introduction (unlikely in 12 days)

The very short timeframe (12 days) and lack of concrete new information sources make a significant further increase less likely. The community prediction tends to be sticky in the absence of major new developments.

Outside view calibration:

The current CP of exactly 23.00% is already at the threshold. For the question to resolve YES, the CP must be strictly greater than 23.00% on Feb 28.

Key calibration factors:
1. **Baseline movement probability**: In a 12-day period without major news, Metaculus CPs typically show small random fluctuations (±1-2 percentage points)
2. **Recent news already priced in**: The Feb 6 and Feb 13 speculation stories are 11 and 4 days old respectively. If they were going to cause a major shift, it likely already occurred
3. **Threshold precision**: The question requires CP > 23.00%, not ≥ 23.00%. Even a tiny increase (to 23.01%) would resolve YES
4. **Information asymmetry**: We don't have the full time series, but the agent suggests the speculation stories typically cause 2-4 point jumps. If CP was ~19-21% before Feb 6, it may have already jumped to 23%
5. **Probability of new information**: In 12 days, there's a modest chance (perhaps 20-30%) of additional reporting, new expert commentary, or other developments that could nudge the prediction higher

Given:
- The CP is exactly at the threshold
- Recent speculation may have already been incorporated
- 12 days is a short window for major new developments
- But even a small increase (0.01 percentage points) would resolve YES
- Metaculus communities tend to update gradually on speculation
- There's ongoing media attention to the retirement question

I estimate roughly 35-45% chance the CP will be above 23.00% on Feb 28. The precision of being exactly at 23.00% now suggests the community is in equilibrium, but the recency of the speculation stories and potential for follow-up reporting or new forecasters entering creates meaningful probability of a small upward drift.

Outside View Prediction:
42%
