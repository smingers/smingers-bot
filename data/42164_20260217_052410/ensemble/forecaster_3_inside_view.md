Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / alignment
This resolves **Yes** iff the Metaculus community prediction for “Will the composition of the US Supreme Court change in 2026?” is **strictly > 23.00%** at **2026-02-28 19:08:43**; otherwise **No** (unless annulled/resolved early).

(a) Source analysis (what’s factual vs opinion; quality/date)
- ABC News (“Thomas: I’m not retiring”) — older (Thomas described as 70; clearly not current). Factual quote historically, but stale for 2026 inference. Low weight.
- USA TODAY via AOL (Feb 16, 2026) — high-quality mainstream reporting; mixes facts (Alito age, book date, Senate situation) with **clearly attributed expert speculation** (Murray, Shaw, Vladeck, Lat, Mehlman). Highly relevant and very recent.
- Newsweek (date not stated here; appears recent) — reports **Kalshi odds** for Thomas resignation before Trump term ends and trend down from 67% to ~40%. Useful as “market-ish” signal; Newsweek itself is mid-tier, but Kalshi number is a concrete datum.
- The Nation (Feb 6, 2026) — opinion. The key **fact** is book publication date; inference “therefore retire” is speculative. Medium-low weight.
- Above the Law (Feb 14, 2026) — legal-news commentary/rumor mill; mostly speculative, no direct sourcing from Alito. Low-medium weight.
- Bloomberg Law (Jan 14, 2026) — credible outlet; explicitly a “predictions” piece. The “no retirements in 2026” claim is opinion, but from a plugged-in legal journalist. Moderate weight.
- Vox (Jan 1, 2026) — staff forecasts; “Alito likely to retire before end of 2026” is opinion, but transparently probabilistic. Moderate weight.
- Other AskNews items (marketing, India SCOTUS, etc.) — irrelevant to US SCOTUS composition.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence
- None that directly indicates an imminent retirement/seat-change *in the next 12 days* (no official announcement; no bill advancing).

Moderate evidence
- USA TODAY/AOL (Feb 16): multiple identifiable experts converging on “retire end of term” as a plausible strategic move + salient factual hook (Oct 6, 2026 book date). This supports a **modest upward drift** in Metaculus CP as more forecasters notice.
- Kalshi odds on Thomas resignation trending down to ~40% (before 2029): suggests some “markets” are cooling on retirement narratives overall, which can cap Metaculus enthusiasm.

Weak evidence
- The Nation + Above the Law: amplify the same book-date signal; likely mostly already priced in by Feb 16 CP=23%.
- ABC older “not retiring”: stale, limited predictive value now.
- Vox/Bloomberg “predictions”: offsetting opinions (Vox up, Bloomberg down), likely already absorbed by the crowd by mid-February.

Net evidence direction for “CP > 23 by Feb 28”
- Slight upward pressure from fresh mainstream coverage (USA TODAY Feb 16) and continued chatter.
- Slight downward/capping pressure from (i) lack of concrete signals, (ii) Kalshi cooling on Thomas, (iii) some credible commentary expecting no retirements.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Time left: ~12 days (Feb 17 → Feb 28 snapshot).
- If halved (~6 days): I’d move closer to 50/50 but slightly *lower* chance of >23, because there’s less time for additional forecasters to update (and “stickiness” at the current level matters).
- If doubled (~24 days): slightly *higher* chance of >23, because more time for follow-up reporting / additional Metaculus participation to shift the recency-weighted median.

(d) Justification (updating from outside view)
Outside view base rate given: 42% for CP ending up >23.

Key inside-view considerations:
- Status quo: CP is exactly 23.00% as of Feb 16. In short windows, Metaculus CP often moves, but not always meaningfully; absent new catalysts it can remain near the same local equilibrium.
- The most “new-to-the-marginal-forecaster” catalyst is the **Feb 16 USA TODAY** mainstream piece. Because it’s (i) highly visible and (ii) includes multiple named experts, it modestly increases the odds that additional participants push their estimates upward in the next two weeks.
- Counterpoint: the community is already sitting at 23%, which *looks like* it may already reflect the retirement-rumor discourse. Also, Kalshi’s Thomas odds drifting down implies some skepticism, limiting how far Metaculus drifts up without harder signals.

Given these, I nudge the outside-view 42% upward modestly (not a large shift, because there’s no strong new factual development since Feb 16 and the window is short).

Probability calibration
I expect a near-coinflip on whether the CP prints slightly above vs at/below 23.00%, with a small bias upward from the Feb 16 mainstream coverage and continuing rumor circulation.
- Inside-view estimate: 51%

Checklist:
1) Criteria paraphrase: “Yes if Metaculus CP for SCOTUS-change-in-2026 is >23.00% at 2026-02-28 19:08:43; else No (or follow early resolution).”
2) Outside view base rate: 42%.
3) Consistency check: “51 out of 100 times, the Metaculus CP on Feb 28 is >23.00%.” Reasonable given near-threshold + slight upward news pressure.
4) Top evidence (<=20 words each):
   - Feb 16 USA TODAY piece: multiple named experts discuss plausible Alito strategic retirement; book-date fact.
   - No official retirement/legislation signals; absent catalysts CP can be sticky near 23.
   - Kalshi Thomas-resignation odds down to ~40% (before 2029), suggesting cooling sentiment.
   - Continued rumor amplification (Nation/Above the Law) can bring marginal forecasters in.
5) Blind spot: A sudden credible leak/announcement about Alito retiring could spike CP well above 23 quickly.
6) Status quo outcome: With no new developments, CP may hover at ~23 and resolve No; this tempers over-updating.

Probability: 51%
