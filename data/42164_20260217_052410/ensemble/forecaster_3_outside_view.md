Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each source adds; quality; fact vs opinion)

- **Guttmacher (May 2024)**  
  *What it is:* Background on post-*Dobbs* abortion restrictions.  
  *Usefulness here:* Essentially none for forecasting *Supreme Court composition change* probabilities or near-term Metaculus CP movement.  
  *Quality:* Credible policy org; but off-topic for this forecast.

- **USA TODAY (Feb 16, 2026) summary**  
  *What it adds (facts):* Alito’s age/tenure; Republicans currently control the Senate; Alito has a book coming in October 2026.  
  *What is opinion/speculation:* Interpreting the book timing as a “signal” of retirement; pundit quotes about likelihood/timing.  
  *Quality:* Mainstream outlet; factual claims likely reliable; retirement inference is inherently speculative even when attributed to identifiable experts (Murray, Shaw, Vladeck, etc.).  
  *Relevance:* Moderate—could affect forecasters’ beliefs about a 2026 vacancy, but much of this is already public and may already be “priced” into the 23.00%.

- **The Nation (Feb 6, 2026) summary**  
  *What it adds (facts):* Book title and publication date; term start date.  
  *What is opinion:* Strong interpretive leap that October timing is a “giant tell” that Alito retires in July 2026.  
  *Quality:* Advocacy/opinion magazine; factual tidbits useful, but inference is low-to-medium reliability.  
  *Relevance:* Could nudge Metaculus sentiment upward, but weaker evidentiary weight.

- **Slate (Feb 13, 2026) summary**  
  *What it adds (facts):* Notes Alito media activity; mentions political incentives; names potential successors (speculative).  
  *What is opinion:* The central thesis (“sure looks like…”) is interpretation; some content is semi-satirical.  
  *Quality:* Opinion/journalism hybrid; not a primary-reporting confirmation of retirement.  
  *Relevance:* Could increase chatter and marginally raise CP, but it’s not dispositive new evidence.

- **SCOTUSblog (Sep 2, 2025; Apr 2, 2025; Jan 5, 2026) summaries**  
  *What they add:* Procedural/political context about Court behavior and Trump litigation; no direct composition-change signals.  
  *Quality:* Generally high for legal reporting/commentary; but mostly irrelevant to retirements/seat expansion in 2026.  
  *Relevance:* Low for *near-term* CP movement on composition change.

- **Agent report (compiled; Feb 2026 context)**  
  *What it adds (facts/claims):* Confirms we lack the CP time series; highlights the same Alito-retirement speculation; notes no federal court-expansion bill progress in Jan–Feb 2026; notes Utah state-court expansion news.  
  *Quality:* Mixed—useful as a pointer; but it explicitly reports missing key quantitative data and includes some unverifiable “shared widely” type claims.  
  *Relevance:* Moderate: reinforces that the main plausible CP-moving “news” recently is Alito-retirement speculation, and that nothing concrete has happened.

**Net from sources:** There is *speculation* (not confirmation) about Alito retiring; no confirmed departure; no federal seat-expansion action. So, for an “outside view” on **CP movement over the next ~11 days**, we should expect **inertia** with some chance of small drift.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view baseline)

We’re not directly forecasting “Will SCOTUS change in 2026?”; we’re forecasting whether **the Metaculus community prediction** for that target question will be **> 23.00%** on a specific date.

Useful reference classes:

1. **Two-week movement of Metaculus community predictions for medium-salience political binary questions**  
   - Tends to be *sticky* absent breaking news; small changes are common but not guaranteed, especially if liquidity is moderate.

2. **Two-week movement when the threshold equals the current displayed CP (at two decimals)**  
   - When the threshold is the *current value*, “Yes” occurs if CP ticks up by even 0.01 (depending on rounding), while “No” occurs if it stays the same or ticks down.  
   - This creates an asymmetry: “no change” is an automatic “No”.

3. **Conditional time-decay questions (events with a fixed deadline, here end of 2026)**  
   - If no new evidence arrives, probabilities often drift *down slightly* as the “time remaining” shrinks (though over 11 days, the effect is small).

**Most suitable reference class:** (2) + (1): short-horizon CP movement around a knife-edge threshold, with some inertia and small drift.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Today:** 2026-02-17  
- **Check time:** 2026-02-28  
- **Horizon:** ~11 days

Over ~11 days, absent a genuine retirement announcement or health shock, large CP moves are unlikely; typical movement (if any) is small (fractions to a couple points). Also, retirements usually cluster around end-of-term (late June/early July), so February is more about rumor than action. That pattern usually supports **stability** rather than a steady climb.

---

### (d) Justification (outside view synthesis)

Starting point: CP is **23.00%** as of 2026-02-16.

Outside-view expectations over the next 11 days:

- **Status quo / inertia:** A meaningful chance the CP remains exactly at 23.00% (to two decimals) if there’s limited new forecasting activity or no new information.
- **Small-drift direction:**  
  - *Downward drift* is slightly more likely than upward drift in a no-news window because (i) deadline-driven time decay and (ii) rumor-driven spikes often mean-revert once the initial chatter passes. The main speculation articles cited are already out by Feb 16 and plausibly incorporated into the 23.00%.
  - *Upward drift* still plausible if additional commentary amplifies the Alito-retirement narrative or if more forecasters discover the story and update.
- **Upset/rare-event consideration:** Truly new info (leak, health event, surprise announcement, legislative move) is low probability in an 11-day band, but not zero; that tail risk adds variance rather than a clear directional push.

So, as an outside view, I’d expect:
- A non-trivial probability of **no visible change** (leading to “No”).
- Slightly higher probability of **down** than **up** movement, given lack of fresh catalysts.
- Therefore **P(CP on Feb 28 > 23.00%)** modestly **below 50%**.

---

Outside view calibration:

- A natural “coin-flip” baseline for “higher vs not higher” would be 50%, but the **“exactly equal counts as No”** plus **inertia** pushes below 50%.  
- Given typical short-horizon stickiness on Metaculus and that recent speculative news is likely already priced in, I’d calibrate to the low-to-mid 40s rather than near 50.

Outside View Prediction:
**41.8%**
