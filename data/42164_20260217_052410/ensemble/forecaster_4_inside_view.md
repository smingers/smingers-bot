Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (quality, fact vs opinion – abridged)
1. USA TODAY / AOL, 16 Feb 2026 – mainstream news; factual age/tenure of Alito, Senate control, October-book date; quoted law-professor speculation (opinion).  High reliability for facts, moderate for opinions.
2. The Nation, 06 Feb 2026 – opinion magazine; only new hard fact is same 6 Oct book date; retirement inference is speculation.  Moderate reliability, mostly opinion.
3. Above the Law, 14 Feb 2026 – legal blog; repeats book date, labels “rumor.”  Similar quality to #2.
4. Newsweek, 2025-12 and ABC News (older) – confirm Thomas repeatedly said he is “not retiring”; Kalshi market now ~40 % that he leaves before Jan 2029.  Reliable for quotes/market data; forward-looking elements are opinion.
5. Remaining AskNews items – none report an actual vacancy or court-packing bill; therefore only background.

(b) Evidence weighing
Strong
• Structural: SCOTUS retirements usually announced late June/early July; February announcements rare (Breyer 2022 an exception).  
• Metaculus CP “stickiness” in last-fortnight windows – historical observation that median often moves ≤1 pp without fresh news.
Moderate
• Alito October-book date interpreted by several independent commentators as retirement signal.  
• Kalshi 40 % market on Thomas before 2029 implies single-digit chance of announcement in the next couple of weeks.
Weak
• Media rumor mills themselves may nudge forecasters slightly upward.  
• Possibility of sudden health event is low-base-rate anecdote.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Forecast horizon: 11.0 days (17 Feb → 28 Feb 2026).  If horizon were halved (≈5 days) I’d drop probability ~4 pp (less time for news).  If doubled (~22 days) I’d raise ~4–5 pp because odds of a surprise announcement grow slightly.

(d) Justification / inside-view update
Outside-view baseline (from reference class of knife-edge Metaculus CP moves) = 41.8 %.
Adjustments:
+2 pp for ongoing Alito-retirement chatter possibly drawing in additional forecasters (moderate evidence).
–3 pp for natural downward/flat drift as time remaining to 31 Dec 2026 shrinks and absence of truly new facts (strong evidence).
+1 pp tail risk of abrupt retirement/health shock even in February (weak but asymmetric payoff).
Net inside view = 41.8 %  + 2 – 3 + 1 ≈ 41 %.

Probability calibration
I therefore judge that about 41 out of 100 times, the community prediction on 28 Feb 2026 19:08 UTC would be above 23 %.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will Metaculus CP for ‘SCOTUS composition changes in 2026’ exceed 23.00 % on 28 Feb 2026?”  
2. Base rate used: 41.8 % short-horizon upward-tick likelihood.  
3. Consistency: “41 of 100 times, CP ends up > 23.00 % in 11 days” – coherent.  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):
   • No justice has announced a departure; February announcements historically rare.  
   • CP currently equals threshold; median forecasts change little over 10 days absent news.  
   • Alito 6 Oct book fuels retirement rumors attracting media attention.  
   • Kalshi puts Thomas-retirement before 2029 at 40 %, implying small near-term odds.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden health crisis forcing immediate resignation/death before 28 Feb would spike CP well above threshold.  
6. Status-quo bias checked – “no change” is likely and resolves to No, hence probability kept below 50 %.

Probability: 41%
