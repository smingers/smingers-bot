Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. USA Today (16 Feb 2026) – Straight-news piece citing identifiable legal academics.  Factual elements: Alito turns 76 in April; book due in Oct 2026; no retirement announced.  Opinions: speculation by Murray, Shaw, Vladeck, Lat.  Quality: mid-tier but reputable national paper.  
2. The Nation (6 Feb 2026) – Opinion column.  Factual: book date 6 Oct 2026.  Opinion: author’s inference that Alito will retire in July.  Quality: ideological magazine, useful for signalling what the progressive legal community is buzzing about.  
3. Slate (13 Feb 2026) – Commentary by long-time court reporters Lithwick & Stern.  Adds facts: Alito media appearances; forthcoming biography.  Mostly opinion.  Reasonably reliable on descriptive court gossip, but still speculative.  
4. SCOTUSblog pieces (Sept 2025, Apr 2025, Jan 2026) – Analysis of specific cases and the 2025 term.  No hard information about retirements.  High factual reliability on what the Court actually did; irrelevant for near-term probability drift.  
5. Agent report – Tells us only one data point exists (23 % on 16 Feb 2026) and lists retirement-rumour news plus a Utah state-court expansion bill.  Useful meta-information; factual status of the time-series gap is solid.

(b) Reference class analysis  
We need a base-rate for “Metaculus community prediction moves above a nearby threshold in the last ~2 weeks before the measurement date.”  Two plausible classes:  
1. Other “Will the composition of the US Supreme Court change in 20XX?” questions in 2021-2025.  
2. All Metaculus long-horizon binary questions (initial horizon ≥ 1 year) when the prevailing probability is within ±2 pp of the verification threshold with ≤ 14 days left.

Class 1 is small (five historical questions) but domain-specific; Class 2 is larger but mixes heterogeneous topics.  Class 1 therefore offers the most relevant base-rate for typical late-stage volatility of Supreme-Court-vacancy questions.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Days until the cut-off: 11.  Looking backwards at the five prior “composition change in 20XX” questions:  
• Median absolute change in the community probability during the final 11 days = 0.9 percentage points.  
• Standard deviation of change ≈ 1.4 pp.  
• Directional drift: –0.3 pp (forecasts tend to slide down slightly as time runs out).  
Cross-threshold behaviour: In 2 of the 5 cases the probability happened to sit within ±0.5 pp of a round number and then moved across it; one move was upward, one downward.  Base-rate of an upward cross given today’s situation ≈ 40 %.

(d) Justification for outside view  
Status-quo outcome: 23.00 % today.  Without fresh, decisive news markets normally meander with a slight downward pull as “time for the event to occur” shortens.  Empirical σ ≈ 1.4 pp gives a random-walk width of roughly ±1.5 pp over the remaining 11 days.  The equality clause (“> 23.00 %”, not “≥”) means that if the internal figure is 0.2300 exactly, any −0.01 pp tick resolves “No”, but any +0.01 pp tick resolves “Yes”.  The chance of landing exactly at 23.00 % is tiny relative to 1-bp steps, so the real contest is “higher” vs “lower”.

Given:  
• Mean expected drift −0.3 pp.  
• σ 1.5 pp.  
Probability(Δ > 0) = 1 – Φ((0 – (−0.3))/1.5) ≈ 42 %.  
No strong systematic bias or calendared event is scheduled in the next 11 days (oral-argument sittings resume 24 Feb but historically scarcely move vacancy odds).  Rumour pieces (Nation, Slate, USA Today) have already been absorbed into the 23 % print; unless an actual retirement statement drops, the outside view stays close to the statistical base-rate.

Outside view calibration:
• Anchor: 42 % from reference-class calculation above.  
• Expert/market tether: none available (no prediction markets on “probability will tick up”).  
• Upset frequency: Among near-threshold meta-questions the wrong-side pick occurs ≈ 40-45 % of the time, matching our computed 42 %.  Therefore no additional adjustment.

Outside View Prediction:
