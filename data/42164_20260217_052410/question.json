    "description": "Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41072\n- Original question title: Will the composition of the US Supreme Court change in 2026?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 23.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before January 1, 2027, any of the following takes place:\n> \n> * a sitting US Supreme Court Justice officially leaves office\n> * a federal bill that changes the number of seats in the US Supreme Court is enacted, regardless of the effective date.\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> A Justice announcing their intention to leave will not resolve this question before the exit takes place.\n> \n> The composition of the US Supreme Court as of December 2025 is the following:\n> \n> * Chief Justice John Roberts\n> * Associate Justice Clarence Thomas\n> * Associate Justice Samuel Alito\n> * Associate Justice Sonia Sotomayor\n> * Associate Justice Elena Kagan\n> * Associate Justice Neil Gorsuch\n> * Associate Justice Brett Kavanaugh\n> * Associate Justice Amy Coney Barrett\n> * Associate Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson\n\nOriginal background: \n> The US Supreme Court has made many monumental decisions in the recent years. Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health overturned Roe v. Wade, allowing states to [ban](https://www.guttmacher.org/state-policy/explore/state-policies-abortion-bans) abortions. Trump v. United States [offers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trump_v._United_States) US presidents absolute immunity from criminal prosecution for all \"official acts\" (interpreted broadly) during a presidency. Important cases before the Court at the time of question writing include [Louisiana v. Callais](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40417/will-scotus-strike-down-louisianas-congressional-map-restoring-gop-lean/), which could strike down a majority-Black congressional district and restore Republican-leaning a map to Louisiana and other Deep South states; and [Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/39893/scotus-ruling-on-tariffs-in-2025/), in which the Court is to decide on the legality of many of Donald Trump's tariffs imposed in 2025.\n> \n> The US Constitution [allows](https://www.law.georgetown.edu/legal-ethics-journal/blog/lifetime-appointments-of-federal-judges-a-double-edged-sword/) Supreme Court justices to serve for life. The Court has a 6-3 Republican majority, with the following configuration:&#x20;\n> \n> | Justice                                                                      | Age (Dec 2025) | Year of Appointment | Appointed by          |\n> | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------- | ------------------- | --------------------- |\n> | [John G.

At the time of this question, the Metaculus Community had Democrats with a [32% chance ](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/36370/us-senate-plurality-after-2026-midterms/)of taking control of the US Senate in the 2026 midterm elections, which would greatly complicate Trump's ability to get his Supreme Court nominees confirmed, if it were to occur.\n> \n> Since 1970, 34% of years have had a vacancy in the Supreme Court.
