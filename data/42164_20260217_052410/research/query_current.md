Analysis:
The probability that Metaculus users will push their aggregate forecast above 23 % in the next eleven days is most sensitive to any fresh evidence that 1) a justice could soon leave the bench (retirement, health scare, death, impeachment pressure) or 2) Congress might meaningfully advance a bill to enlarge or otherwise alter the Court.  News items to watch therefore include: explicit statements or hints from the older justices (Thomas 77, Alito 75, Sotomayor 71), sudden medical events, leaks from the White House or Senate Judiciary Committee, and the status of any court-expansion legislation introduced in the 119th Congress.  Timely coverage will appear in mainstream political outlets, legal trade publications, and Capitol-Hill reporting.
