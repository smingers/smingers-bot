Analysis:
The key to judging whether the Metaculus community prediction will rise above 23 % in the next eleven days is to understand (a) any fresh signals that a Justice might soon leave the bench and (b) any new Congressional movement to change the Court’s size. Both would very likely push the probability upward.  Therefore, the most relevant historical context is recent or breaking news about:
• Health or retirement rumours concerning the older justices (Clarence Thomas 77, Samuel Alito 75, Sonia Sotomayor 71, John Roberts 70).  
• Supreme-Court-expansion legislation being introduced or gaining support.  
• How the Metaculus community prediction itself has moved in the past few weeks; a rising-or-falling trend can be very informative on whether another 0.01–0.02 jump is plausible in the short window to 28 Feb.
