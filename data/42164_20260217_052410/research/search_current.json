Alito's book is set to drop the day after the term starts.\n\n3. **Historical Context for Book Releases:** Recent sitting Supreme Court justices released their books on the following dates:\n   - Amy Coney Barrett: September 9, 2025\n   - Neil Gorsuch: May 5, 2025\n   - Ketanji Brown Jackson: September 4, 2024\n   - Sonia Sotomayor: January 25, 2022 and September 3, 2019\n\n4. **Author's Opinion (Dario Castillejos):** The author speculates that the October publication date suggests Alito is planning to retire at the end of the Supreme Court's current term in **July 2026**. The reasoning is that:\n   - Justices typically release books in September (before the term starts) or May (after cases end) when they have more free time\n   - October is when justices are \"arguably too busy to sell a book\"\n   - This timing would allow Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate to appoint and confirm a replacement before the 2026 midterm elections\n\n5. **Alito's Age and Motivations:** Alito turns **76 in April** [2026]. The author suggests Alito may want to retire while Republicans still control the Senate, given uncertainty about the midterm elections.\n\n6. **Senate Control Context:** The article notes that \"Republicans are still favored to hang on to the Senate\" but \"it's far from certain.\"\n\n**Note:** This article is primarily opinion/speculation by the author based on the book publication date.

Pancholi, will begin final hearings on petitions concerning gender discrimination against women at various religious sites, including the Sabarimala Temple in Kerala. The Bench stated that the hearings will commence on April 7, 2026, with a projected conclusion by April 22, 2026. The Court directed all concerned parties to file their written submissions on or before March 14, 2026. This landmark proceeding addresses longstanding legal and constitutional questions about women's access to religious spaces across different faiths.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 12:08 PM\nSource:[Hindustan](https://www.livehindustan.com/national/nine-judge-sc-bench-to-hear-pleas-on-religious-discrimination-against-women-201771243227646.html)\n\n**Supreme Court 9-Judge Bench To Hear Sabarimala Reference Issues From April 7**\nThe Supreme Court of India will hear the Sabarimala review reference before a 9-judge bench starting April 7, 2026, with hearings expected to conclude by April 22, 2026. The composition of the bench will be announced separately by the Chief Justice of India. The 3-judge bench comprising CJI Surya Kant, Justice Joymalya Bagchi, and Justice Vipul M Pancholi ordered the listing of the reference. Parties supporting the review will present arguments from April 7\u20139, opponents from April 14\u201316, and rejoinder submissions are scheduled for April 21. The case stems from the September 2018 4:1 majority judgment allowing women of menstruating age to enter the Sabarimala temple, which was challenged through review and writ petitions. The Central Government, through Solicitor General Tushar Mehta, supports the review. In November 2019, a 5-judge bench referred key issues\u2014including women\u2019s entry into mosques, Parsi women\u2019s access to Fire Temples, and the validity of excommunication and Female Genital Mutilation among Dawoodi Bohras\u2014to a larger bench. A 9-judge bench was constituted in January 2020 and, in February 2023, referred the Dawoodi Bohra excommunication practice to the same bench. The bench has framed seven key constitutional questions, including the scope of Article 25 (freedom of religion), the interplay between individual and denomination rights under Articles 25 and 26, the limits of 'morality' in constitutional interpretation, and whether non-members can challenge religious practices via PILs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:43 AM\nSource:[Live Law](https://www.livelaw.in/top-stories/supreme-court-sabarimala-review-9-judge-bench-reference-dawoodi-bohra-parsi-muslim-women-entry-dargah-fire-temple-523254)\n\n**SC to form 9-judge bench for Sabarimala, other religious entry cases; Kerala govt to file stance by March 14**\nThe Supreme Court of India will constitute a nine-judge Constitution bench to hear a batch of petitions concerning alleged gender discrimination at religious sites, including the Sabarimala Temple in Kerala, starting April 7, 2026. The bench, to be formed by an administrative order from the Chief Justice of India, will hear the cases at 10:30 a.m. and has directed all parties, including the Kerala government, to file written submissions by March 14, 2026. The court has dismissed prior objections about the maintainability of referring the matter to a larger bench, citing its February 10, 2020 nine-judge decision which confirmed the apex court\u2019s authority to refer questions to a larger bench even during the review stage. Seven key legal questions, originally framed in 2020, remain pending and will be addressed in the upcoming hearings. Krishan Kumar Singh has been appointed nodal counsel for the review petitioners, while Advocate-on-Record Shivam Singh will assist amicus K Parmeswar in preparing submissions. The Chief Justice emphasized the priority of the nine-judge bench, instructing lawyers to adjust their schedules accordingly. The review petitions stem from the Supreme Court\u2019s September 28, 2018 five-judge bench verdict, which allowed women of all ages to enter Sabarimala Temple, ruling that excluding women aged 10\u201350 constituted gender discrimination and violated constitutional rights. The verdict sparked widespread protests in Kerala, with political and religious groups opposing the change to tradition. In 2020, the Kerala government reported that 51 women had entered Sabarimala post-2018 verdict, mostly from Andhra Pradesh, Tamil Nadu, Telangana, and Goa, with none from Kerala. The batch of cases also includes challenges to Muslim women\u2019s entry into dargahs and mosques, Parsi women\u2019s access to fire temples after marrying non-Parsis, and the legality of female genital mutilation in the Dawoodi Bohra community.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:11 AM\nSource:[OnManorama](https://www.onmanorama.com/news/kerala/2026/02/16/sabarimala-temple-women-entry-supreme-court-nine-member-bench.html)\n\n**U.S. Dollar Defies Predictions: Volatility Expected in 2026**\nAlan Greenspan, former FOMC chair, noted that forecasting currency movements is akin to flipping a coin, a view confirmed by 2025's market behavior. Despite expectations that tariffs would strengthen the U.S. dollar, the currency initially declined by about 10% in early 2025. However, it later rebounded, defying predictions\u2014highlighting the complex interplay between structural (long-term) and cyclical (short-term) factors affecting exchange rates. Structural forces, such as the U.S. dollar's real effective exchange rate being significantly above its historical average and a gradual decline in global dollar reserves (now at nearly 60%), point to potential long-term weakness. Meanwhile, short-term factors\u2014including reduced trade deficits due to tariffs, record customs revenues exceeding $200 billion in 2025 (0.5\u20131.0% of GDP), and strong capital inflows driven by artificial intelligence-related investments\u2014have supported the dollar. These forces balanced out in the second half of 2025, resulting in a stagnant but stable dollar. The same dynamic is expected in 2026, with volatility likely to persist due to conflicting pressures. A major potential shock could arise if the Federal Reserve loses its independence\u2014e.g., if the Supreme Court rules in favor of the Trump administration or if the next Fed chair is seen as politically influenced\u2014accelerating diversification away from the dollar. Conversely, a productivity surge from AI could boost economic growth and attract capital, supporting the dollar. As of February 2026, the outcome remains uncertain, leading to the expectation of continued oscillation rather than a clear directional trend.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 04:46 AM\nSource:[QuotidianoNet](https://www.quotidiano.net/economia/finanza/il-dollaro-usa-smentisce-bda9dec1)\n\n**Redistricting Betrayal in Virginia - The American Spectator | USA News and Politics**\nIn February 2026, The American Spectator published an article criticizing Virginia's redistricting process, arguing that the state's 2020 constitutional amendment establishing the Virginia Redistricting Commission (VRC) to prevent partisan gerrymandering has been undermined by Democratic lawmakers. Despite voters approving the amendment to remove redistricting from partisan control, Democrats\u2014after gaining a governing trifecta\u2014passed a resolution in early 2025 to allow a mid-decade redistricting by the legislature, bypassing constitutional procedures. Circuit Court Judge Jack Hurley initially blocked the plan, but the Virginia Supreme Court lifted the injunction without addressing the case\u2019s merits, allowing the new map to proceed. The article claims the new map would shift Virginia\u2019s congressional delegation from a 6\u20135 Democratic majority to 10\u20131, a drastic change. A referendum on April 21, 2026, will ask voters whether to amend the constitution to allow temporary legislative redistricting while resuming the standard process after the 2030 census. The article expresses skepticism about the Virginia Supreme Court\u2019s impartiality, noting its justices are elected by the legislature and have mixed partisan leanings, with four seen as Republican-leaning and three as Democrat-leaning. The author, David Catron, contends that the court\u2019s reliance on 'tradition and precedent' makes a pro-democratic ruling unlikely, calling the current political climate in Virginia a 'pit of political vipers' and expressing doubt that the court will uphold the 2020 voter mandate. The article concludes with a personal critique of state leadership, including Governor Abigail Spanberger and former Attorney General Jason Miyares.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 03:19 AM\nSource:[The American Spectator | USA News and Politics](https://spectator.org/redistricting-betrayal-in-virginia/)\n\n**Spanish Voters Demand Political Change and Regeneration**\nAccording to an article published by La Raz\u00f3n on February 16, 2026, Spanish citizens are demanding a drastic political change to enable a legislative period of regeneration and recovery for a democracy perceived as degraded and impoverished under the leadership of Pedro S\u00e1nchez and his allies. The article challenges the official CIS barometers showing strong support for S\u00e1nchez, arguing that these reflect a manipulated narrative perpetuated by the Moncloa administration. It asserts that despite the PSOE\u2019s apparent momentum, demoscopic consensus reveals a consolidated decline in support for S\u00e1nchez and the left, alongside a robust rise in the center-right, led by the PP, and a significant surge in Vox\u2019s support\u2014especially among new and young voters. An NC Report survey cited in the article predicts the PP would secure 33.1% of the vote and 142\u2013144 seats, a lead of over 40 seats over the PSOE (100\u2013102 seats), with Pedro S\u00e1nchez losing 19\u201321 seats. Vox is projected to gain 18.1% of the vote and 64\u201366 seats, up from 33. Vox\u2019s growth is attributed to its appeal among new and younger voters. Sumar and Podemos are expected to suffer severe losses, dwindling to near-testimonial status in parliament. The combined center-right bloc could reach 206\u2013210 seats, surpassing the 175-seat majority needed for governance and approaching the 230-seat threshold required for major structural and constitutional reforms. The article concludes that it is 'incontestable' that Spaniards want a transformative political shift to restore democratic integrity, and calls on political leaders to honor this mandate by avoiding petty conflicts and errors in judgment.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 01:18 AM\nSource:[La Raz\u00f3n](https://www.larazon.es/opinion/espanoles-quieren-cambio-regeneracion_20260216699257149243cc133c4ab6bf.html)\n\n**How the US Supreme Court's Conservative Turn Is Reshaping LGBTQ+ Rights Jurisprudence in America**\nThe article examines the impact of the U.S. Supreme Court's conservative shift on LGBTQ+ rights jurisprudence, focusing on two upcoming cases\u2014West Virginia v. B.P.J. and Hecox v. Little\u2014concerning transgender athletes' participation in girls' and women's sports. These cases challenge whether state bans violate the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment and Title IX. The Court's recent rulings, including United States v. Skrmetti (2025), which upheld a Tennessee law banning gender-affirming care for minors, reflect a consistent six-to-three conservative majority, with all Democratic appointees dissenting. Since the landmark Obergefell v. Hodges (2015) decision legalizing same-sex marriage, the Court has seen a sharp ideological shift due to three Republican-appointed justices under Donald Trump (Gorsuch, Kavanaugh, Barrett), which tilted the Court firmly rightward. Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson\u2019s appointment under Biden did not alter the balance. The Court now largely embraces 'legal originalism,' rejecting the 'living Constitution' approach, as seen in Dobbs v. Jackson (2022), which overturned Roe v. Wade. This interpretive framework limits constitutional recognition of rights not rooted in 'history and tradition,' undermining LGBTQ+ rights. Since Obergefell, the Court has narrowed LGBTQ+ protections in public accommodations (Masterpiece Cakeshop, 2018; 303 Creative LLC v. Elenis, 2023), transgender military service, passport gender recognition (Orr v. Trump, 2025), and gender-affirming care. Only two exceptions exist: Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), which extended Title VII protections to sexual orientation and gender identity, and Masterpiece Cakeshop, where Democratic justices joined the majority.

First, the Trump administration\u2019s executive orders targeting large law firms are likely over, having achieved their goal of intimidating Big Law. Second, the DC Circuit will likely uphold lower court rulings and strike down the executive orders, with judges across the ideological spectrum finding them unconstitutional. Third, the Supreme Court will probably decline to hear any of these cases due to lack of a circuit split and settled constitutional precedent. Fourth, the Supreme Court will increasingly rule against the Trump administration in merits cases involving tariffs, birthright citizenship, and the removal of Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, despite the administration\u2019s strong record on the emergency docket. Fifth, no Supreme Court justices are expected to retire in 2026, as Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito remain active and healthy, with Thomas especially influential in the current conservative majority. Sixth, Kirkland & Ellis and Wachtell Lipton are projected to become the first firms to surpass $10 million in profits per equity partner (PPEP) in 2025, driven by record M&A deal volumes\u2014Kirkland advised on $743 billion in deals, Wachtell on $621 billion, compared to $427 billion and $228 billion in 2024. Seventh, Wachtell Lipton is expected to reclaim its #1 ranking in PPEP from Kirkland in the 2026 rankings, despite Kirkland\u2019s higher deal value, due to Wachtell\u2019s smaller equity partner base and Kirkland\u2019s costly litigation hiring spree that may reduce short-term profitability. The author concludes that 2026 will be a dynamic year for legal news and predicts it 'won\u2019t be boring.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 09:57 AM\nSource:[news.bloomberglaw.com](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/legal-exchange-insights-and-commentary/it-wont-be-boring-7-predictions-for-the-legal-industry-in-2026)\n\n**Ronald Brownstein: The Supreme Court could give the GOP a political lifeline**\nRonald Brownstein argues that the Supreme Court's upcoming decision on the Voting Rights Act (VRA) could provide a critical political lifeline for the Republican Party in defending its narrow five-seat majority in the U.S. House of Representatives in the 2026 midterm elections. Currently, Republicans face significant challenges, including historical trends showing no party has maintained unified control of the White House, House, and Senate through a midterm since 1978, combined with declining approval ratings for former President Donald Trump and strong Democratic performance in the 2025 elections. Efforts by red states to redraw congressional districts have yielded only a minimal net gain due to GOP reluctance in states like Indiana and Democratic counteractions such as California\u2019s redistricting. However, the Republican-appointed Supreme Court majority appears poised to significantly limit or overturn the 1965 VRA provision that prohibits election law changes with discriminatory effects on racial minorities. If the court weakens this provision, Republican-controlled Southern states\u2014including Florida, Louisiana, Georgia, South Carolina, Tennessee, Alabama, and possibly Texas\u2014could redraw district lines to eliminate seats currently held by Black and Latino Democrats. Analysts estimate this could shift at least seven to eight additional House seats to the GOP, with long-term implications extending to state legislative and local elections. The potential elimination of up to 140 Democratic state legislative seats held by people of color\u2014about 40% of the current total\u2014highlights the broad impact. The decision, expected by June but possibly released within six to eight weeks, could allow states time to act before the 2026 election. The Court\u2019s historical pattern under Chief Justice John Roberts\u2014rolling back federal voting regulations and restricting race-conscious remedies\u2014supports the expectation of a conservative ruling. The outcome could entrench Republican dominance in Southern states, despite population growth driven by non-White residents, effectively disenfranchising communities of color. This scenario echoes the Constitution\u2019s three-fifths compromise, raising concerns about a constitutional irony: counting non-White populations for representation while denying them meaningful political voice. The long-term impact would likely not be fully felt until after the 2030 Census, when Republican-controlled states could draw maps with minimal legal constraints, potentially reducing Black and Latino representation for decades. According to Manuel Pastor of the Equity Research Institute, this reflects a GOP strategy to align current demographics with a nostalgic vision of a past America. Brownstein notes that while non-White Republicans have slightly increased in number, they still represent only about 10% of GOP House members, suggesting that any shift in seat design would likely result in more White Republican representation.

Key forecasts include: the U.S. likely transitioning from a liberal to an electoral democracy under Trump\u2019s second presidency, with a low-confidence prediction (V-DEM rating shift); Democrats expected to retake the House in the 2026 midterms (high confidence), though Senate gains remain uncertain; the dismantling of the U.S. Department of Education is unlikely to be completed, with at least one function surviving due to Republican concerns; the Supreme Court may rule that Trump exceeded authority under the IEEPA in imposing tariffs, with a 70% probability; Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito is likely to retire before the end of 2026, given the risk of a Democratic-controlled Senate post-2026; Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu is expected to lose the 2026 election, despite coalition management, due to widespread public fatigue; the war in Ukraine is projected to continue into a fifth year, with no imminent ceasefire; a military conflict over Taiwan remains unlikely in 2026, though economic pressure and gray-zone tactics are expected; housing reform will expand in 2026, with more states passing zoning laws allowing duplexes and multi-unit housing, though a 50% threshold for single-family zoning elimination is unlikely; billionaire wealth is projected to exceed $17 trillion by 2026, driven by AI and inheritance; a U.S. recession in 2026 is slightly more likely than not (55% probability); cage-free eggs will not reach 50% of the U.S. supply by September 2026, despite momentum from 2025 state laws; at least one more U.S. state will ban lab-grown meat in 2026; avian flu vaccination in poultry is unlikely to be authorized nationally by 2026 due to trade and regulatory hurdles; data center construction will face growing resistance and supply constraints, limiting rapid expansion; and a Category 5 hurricane is expected to make landfall in the U.S. in 2026, given La Ni\u00f1a conditions and record Atlantic Ocean heat, though the baseline odds remain low.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 01, 2026 11:00 AM\nSource:[Vox](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/473166/forecasts-2026-trump-congress-democrats-musk-artificial-intelligence-hurricanes)\n\n**Predictions for 2026 (and some commentary)**\nThe article presents a series of speculative predictions for 2026, explicitly disclaiming any use for investment or gambling. It forecasts the Dow Jones Industrial Average closing above 50,000, oil prices below $60 per barrel, and inflation averaging 3% in 2026. GDP growth is projected at 4% for 2026, up from an estimated 3% annualized in 2025. A federal government funding interruption (shutdown) is expected in February 2026, during which Republicans are predicted to concede on Affordable Care Act premium tax credits, despite the author's view that the program has become a financial burden on taxpayers. The federal deficit is expected to remain at approximately $1.8 trillion in fiscal year 2026, consistent with prior years. Electricity prices are expected to rise due to stagnant generating capacity (nuclear, coal, and natural gas) despite growing demand, necessitating rapid construction of new natural gas plants. The utility model faces increasing political pressure, but data centers will still secure power. The Republican caucus in the House is expected to fall below 218 members in 2026, with growing retirements. Republicans are predicted to retain control of the House by a narrow margin, though redistricting efforts will be invalidated by the Supreme Court\u2019s rejection of majority-minority districts, affecting Republican-controlled states. Economic growth and Democratic primary momentum are expected to hinder Democratic electoral success. In sports, Notre Dame is predicted to win the college football championship, the Buffalo Bills to win the Super Bowl, and the Phillies to win the World Series in 2026. The Washington football team is expected to revert to the Redskins name. AI dominated 2025, with robotics expected to be the key trend in 2026. China\u2019s attempts to pressure Taiwan and its allies are expected to fail, strengthening the Quad alliance (U.S., Australia, Japan, India).

Key predictions include: Clarence Thomas will retire before the 2026 midterms despite no immediate electoral urgency; redistricting will not determine the outcome of the midterms due to GOP overreach in Indiana and Trump's unpopularity with independents; thermostatic backlash politics will return, leading to a Democratic 'Blue Wave' in the midterms, with Democrats winning the House and potentially endangering the Republican Senate majority; Donald Trump remains deeply unpopular with independent voters, and no major events are expected to shift voter sentiment; the Supreme Court will gut Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act in Louisiana v. Callais, enabling Southern states to redraw districts to weaken the Congressional Black Caucus, though this will likely not affect the 2026 outcome; the Court will rule against Trump on tariffs, delivering a stinging defeat; it will grant Trump a partial victory on birthright citizenship; mass deportations will be pursued as a political strategy to energize the base, despite a gridlocked Congress; Democrats are expected to retake the House, possibly due to retirements, though Senate gains are unlikely; Vivek Ramaswamy will lose the Ohio gubernatorial race due to lack of appeal among independents and Trump voters, and a weak campaign; Republican infighting will intensify post-Trump, with establishment forces attempting to reclaim the party; remnants of the Alt-Right will coalesce under Ben Shapiro\u2019s leadership, forming a conservative fundamentalist movement; race realism and the 'Jewish Question' will gain traction, especially among younger conservatives; Israel is predicted to return to war in Gaza, Lebanon, or against Iran, though the U.S. will not join; political violence will persist, with a major act\u2014assassination, bombing, or riot\u2014expected in 2026; and ultimately, MAGA will fail, with Trump unable to 'Make America Great Again,' marking 2026 as a year of backlash and mixed Supreme Court outcomes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 20, 2025 05:34 PM\nSource:[Occidental Dissent](https://occidentaldissent.com/2025/12/20/2026-predictions/)\n\n**U.S. Democracy Threat Index: $10,000 in Forecasting Prizes  --  LessWrong**\nA federal judge found probable cause that the Trump administration willfully defied a court order regarding deportation flights to El Salvador, intensifying a contempt probe that now seeks whistleblower and DOJ testimony on who authorized the flights and how the government responded. This case, along with related issues involving contempt referrals, DOJ follow-through, and the treatment of individuals sent to foreign prisons, is included in Metaculus's U.S. Democracy Threat Index\u2014a forecasting initiative developed with Bright Line Watch, a nonpartisan group of political scientists from Dartmouth and other institutions. The index tracks 39 observable indicators across six areas: electoral integrity, political rights, civil liberties, rule of law, institutional checks and balances, and information integrity. Each question forecasts whether a specific event will occur within a two-year window, with historical data backfilled for 2021\u20132024 to establish base rates. Current forecasting periods are 2025\u201326 and 2027\u201328. The index value is the average probability across all 39 questions, where higher values indicate greater predicted threat to democratic institutions and lower values indicate greater resilience. The index dynamically updates as new information emerges and forecasts are revised, offering real-time signal on institutional health. A $10,000 prize pool has been introduced to incentivize accurate predictions: $7,500 will be awarded based on forecast accuracy from December 12, 2025 onward, and $2,500 will be awarded based on periodic snapshots aligned with Bright Line Watch\u2019s surveys of political scientists and the American public. The first snapshot is scheduled for January 1, 2026, requiring forecasts to be submitted before that date.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 12, 2025 07:43 PM\nSource:[Maya Farber Brodsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Lmwhzi3cRdSEg6ZDe/u-s-democracy-threat-index-usd10-000-in-forecasting-prizes)\n\n**James Carville Makes Dramatic 2028 SCOTUS Prediction**\nJames Carville, 81, made a dramatic prediction on his podcast *Politics War Room* on November 7, 2025, asserting that Democrats will win all three branches of the U.S. government in the 2028 election. He claimed a Democratic president will establish a special transition advisory committee to reform the Supreme Court, recommending an increase from nine to thirteen justices. Carville stated that a Democratic Senate and House would pass the change, which he described as necessary to restore public trust in the judiciary. He referenced a 'blue ribbon panel of distinguished jurists' to make the recommendation and speculated that former U.S. circuit judge J. Michael Luttig\u2014despite being a conservative\u2014could lead the effort, citing Luttig\u2019s recent criticism of Donald Trump\u2019s potential power grab. Carville previously endorsed Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (AOC) as a potential Democratic presidential nominee, though he later questioned her electability. He also previously predicted Kamala Harris would win the 2024 election, a forecast that did not materialize. The Supreme Court has had nine justices since 1869, though its size has varied historically. President Joe Biden has opposed 'court packing,' warning it would undermine the court\u2019s credibility.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 05:44 PM\nSource:[The Daily Beast](https://www.thedailybeast.com/james-carville-makes-dramatic-2028-prediction-for-the-future-of-scotus/)\n\n**How AI Outperforms Humans in Forecasting the Future**\nMetaculus, a prediction platform, runs quarterly contests where participants use AI to forecast geopolitical events, offering about $5,000 to winners. The platform poses questions such as 'Will Thailand experience a military coup before September\u202f2025?' and 'Will Israel strike the Iranian army again before September\u202f2025?'. Experts estimate probabilities, providing more nuanced answers than simple yes/no. Weeks or months before events, predictions often show notable accuracy: users correctly predicted the Russian invasion of Ukraine two weeks early and assigned a 90\u202f% probability to the cancellation of the U.S. Supreme Court case Roe v.\u202fWade roughly two months before it occurred. When the contest began in June, participants expected AI to outperform humans by 40\u202f% on average, but Metaculus AI achieved over 80\u202f%. Prediction experts update forecasts based on legislators\u2019 policies to anticipate how hypothetical political interventions might affect outcomes, enabling them to advise decision\u2011makers on 'changing the status quo'. However, forecasting broad geopolitical issues remains extremely difficult, with top experts spending days and tens of thousands of dollars on a single question. Rand Corporation estimates that human experts would need months to produce initial forecasts for all questions, let alone update them regularly. AI excels in data\u2011rich domains like weather or quantitative finance, but geopolitical forecasting involves many interdependent factors that humans can sometimes predict more cheaply. Large language models use the same complex information as human forecasters and can simulate human judgment. They improve by predicting many questions, observing performance, and updating methods based on results, at a scale far beyond human capacity. Moreover, machines have an unfair advantage: participants earn points not only for accuracy but also for 'coverage'\u2014the breadth of predictions, the number of questions answered, and the frequency of updates. Even less accurate AI can rank highly by continuously updating estimates in response to emerging news, a feat impossible for humans. The biggest remaining challenge for AI is producing high\u2011quality predictions for all required questions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 11:47 AM\nSource:[elnabaa.net](https://www.elnabaa.net/1136072/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%81%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A4-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
