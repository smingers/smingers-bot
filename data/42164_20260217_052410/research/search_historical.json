Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling in June 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade, eliminating the federal constitutional right to abortion.\n\n2. **Current State of Abortion Bans:**\n   - 41 states have abortion bans in effect with only limited exceptions\n   - 9 states and the District of Columbia do not restrict abortion based on gestational duration\n\n3. **Historical Context:** Research indicates abortion bans disproportionately impact marginalized groups and individuals facing systemic racism and other forms of oppression.\n\n## Key Definitions Provided:\n\n- **Gestational duration:** Typically defined as weeks since last menstrual period (LMP), used by state legislation to define timelines for abortion bans\n- **Viability:** Generally determined to be between 24-26 weeks LMP; a nonmedical term describing when a fetus can survive outside the uterus\n- **Exception categories:** Include general health (may include mental/emotional health), physical health (restricted to bodily functions), and lethal fetal anomaly\n\n## Important Observations:\n\nThe article notes that most exceptions to abortion bans are \"designed to be unworkable, containing vague and contradictory language and imposing cumbersome requirements.\" The inclusion of an exception does not ensure provider availability or willingness to perform procedures.\n\n**Note:** This article provides background information on the state of abortion bans following Dobbs but does not contain information directly relevant to predicting Supreme Court composition changes or Metaculus community prediction movements.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2026/02/16/supreme-court-justice-samuel-alito-retirement-trump/88710036007/\">\n# Summary of USA TODAY Article on Potential Supreme Court Vacancy\n\n## Key Facts and Speculation:\n\n**Justice Samuel Alito's Potential Retirement:**\n- Alito is the second-oldest justice on the Supreme Court and one of the most conservative\n- He joined the court 20 years ago (2005)\n- He will be 76 in April (as of article writing)\n\n**Timing Considerations:**\n- If Alito wants to retire while Republicans control the Senate, he may need to act before the 2026 midterm elections\n- Republicans are expected to have an easier time retaining the Senate than the House, but a loss can't be ruled out\n- Senate Republicans may not want to hold a confirmation hearing during the fall of an election year\n\n**Book Publication as Potential Signal:**\n- Alito has a book coming out in October, right as the court starts a new term\n- This timing is unusual compared to recent books by Justices Ketanji Brown Jackson and Amy Coney Barrett, which were published in September\n\n**Expert Opinions (Named Sources):**\n\n*Melissa Murray* (NYU law professor, Strict Scrutiny podcast co-host): 20 years is \"usually a very good milestone on which to retire\"\n\n*Kate Shaw* (Strict Scrutiny podcast co-host): Speculated Alito could announce in the next few weeks that he will step down at the end of the term\n\n*Steve Vladeck* (Georgetown University law professor): Called the October publication date \"a pretty big tell since one can't exactly go on a book tour during the first argument session of the term\"\n\n*David Lat* (court watcher and lawyer): Questioned whether October publication suggests Alito is staying, noting \"Book buyers are much more interested in what a current justice has to say, as opposed to a retired one\"\n\n*Bruce Mehlman* (Washington consultant): \n- Noted all justices are well-below the average retirement age of 79\n- Stated Alito and Thomas are among Trump's most reliable votes\n- Suggested Trump's \"ability to demand fealty on future nominations may be diminishing\"\n- Pointed out that 8 of the past 10 presidents have had at least one Supreme Court opening in the first two years of their term\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- Only three presidents since the 1950s got to fill more Supreme Court openings than Trump's three: Dwight Eisenhower, Richard Nixon, and Ronald Reagan\n- Justice Clarence Thomas (77) could set the record for longest-serving justice if he stays through May 2028\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.thenation.com/article/politics/newsletter-samuel-alito-retiring/\">\n# Summary of \"Is Samuel Alito Preparing to Disrobe?\"\n\n**Source:** The Nation  \n**Date:** February 06, 2026  \n**Author:** Dario Castillejos\n\n## Key Facts and Information Relevant to the Forecasting Question:\n\n### Supreme Court Justice Samuel Alito's Book and Potential Retirement:\n\n1. **Book Publication Date:** Samuel Alito has a book titled \"So Ordered: An Originalist's View of the Constitution, the Court, and the Country\" scheduled for release on **October 6, 2026**.\n\n2. **Timing Significance:** The Supreme Court's 2026-27 term begins on October 5, 2026 (the first Monday of October). Alito's book is set to drop the day after the term starts.\n\n3. **Historical Context for Book Releases:** Recent sitting Supreme Court justices released their books on the following dates:\n   - Amy Coney Barrett: September 9, 2025\n   - Neil Gorsuch: May 5, 2025\n   - Ketanji Brown Jackson: September 4, 2024\n   - Sonia Sotomayor: January 25, 2022 and September 3, 2019\n\n4. **Author's Opinion (Dario Castillejos):** The author speculates that the October publication date suggests Alito is planning to retire at the end of the Supreme Court's current term in **July 2026**. The reasoning is that:\n   - Justices typically release books in September (when they have attention but are free to promote) or May (when they're not hearing cases)\n   - October is when justices are \"arguably too busy to sell a book\"\n   - This would give Trump and Republicans time to appoint and confirm a replacement before the midterm elections\n   - Alito turns 76 in April 2026\n   - Republicans currently control the Senate but their continued control is \"far from certain\" after the midterms\n\n5. **Author's Assessment:** The author believes Alito doesn't want to \"roll the dice\" and risk being forced to stay on the court if Republicans lose the Senate in the fall 2026 midterms.\n\n**Note:** This article contains primarily opinion and speculation from the author rather than confirmed facts about Alito's retirement plans. The only objective facts are the book publication date and the ages/appointment history of the justices.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2026/02/supreme-court-news-sam-alito-retirement-speculation.html\">\n# Summary of Article: \"It Sure Looks Like This Supreme Court Justice Is Getting Ready to Retire\"\n\n**Source:** Slate Magazine  \n**Date:** February 13, 2026  \n**Authors:** Dahlia Lithwick, Mark Joseph Stern\n\n## Key Facts and Observations:\n\n### Signs of Potential Alito Retirement:\n1. **Recent media activity:** Justice Samuel Alito gave an interview to Politico discussing his judicial philosophy and legacy\n2. **Upcoming book:** A book by Mollie Hemingway titled \"Alito: The Justice Who Reshaped the Supreme Court and Restored the Constitution\" is being published, with speculation that Alito gave interviews (possibly on background) for it\n3. **Legacy management:** The authors interpret these activities as Alito attempting to \"secure his legacy within the conservative legal movement and the conservative media\"\n\n### Political Context and Motivations:\n1. **Senate control concerns:** The article notes there is \"a real chance that Republicans could lose the Senate in the fall,\" which would complicate replacing Alito with a conservative justice\n2. **Current Senate margin:** Republicans currently have \"a comfortable margin in the Senate\"\n3. **Timing consideration:** Retiring before the 2026 midterms would allow Trump to replace him while Republicans control the Senate\n4. **Personal factors:** The article mentions that Alito's wife, Martha-Ann, \"has been counting the minutes until Alito can retire\"\n5. **RBG comparison:** The authors suggest Alito learned from Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg's decision not to retire, which resulted in her replacement by a justice with opposing views\n\n### Potential Successors (Opinions from Named Sources):\nMark Joseph Stern identifies two main candidates:\n1. **Emil Bove** (U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit) - former Trump personal lawyer with demonstrated loyalty, though his scandals might complicate confirmation\n2. **Andy Oldham** (U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit) - described as \"more likely candidate,\" a former Alito clerk, \"MAGA fanatic,\" and \"even further right than Alito\"\n\n### Less Reliable Speculation:\n- Dahlia Lithwick offers more speculative/satirical suggestions including Lindsey Halligan, Jeanine Pirro, and Kash Patel, suggesting Trump might prioritize \"Own the Libs\" appeal over traditional judicial gravitas\n\n**Note:** This article is primarily opinion and speculation by the authors based on circumstantial evidence. No official announcement of retirement has been made.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/09/the-supreme-court-fails-to-apply-its-own-precedent-and-continues-to-sow-confusion-through-its-shadow-docket/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"The Supreme Court fails to apply its own precedent and continues to sow confusion through its shadow docket\"\n\n**Source:** SCOTUSblog  \n**Date:** September 2, 2025  \n**Author:** Carolyn Shapiro\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n### Case Details (National Institutes of Health v. American Public Health Association):\n- On August 21, 2025, the Supreme Court issued an order pausing a district court injunction related to NIH grants\n- The case involved challenges to the cancellation of nearly $800 million in grants based on Trump administration executive orders related to DEI considerations\n- District Court Judge William Young (Reagan appointee) issued a preliminary injunction barring the government from suspending the grants\n- Judge Young stated: \"I have never seen a record where racial discrimination was so palpable \u2026 I've sat on this bench now for 40 years, and I've never seen government racial discrimination like this\"\n\n### Supreme Court's Decision:\n- The Court split 5-4 on both parts of its order\n- Only Justice Amy Coney Barrett was in the majority on both parts\n- The Court granted the Trump administration's request to stay the district court ruling requiring grant payments\n- Simultaneously kept in place a separate portion striking down underlying agency guidelines\n- It took the Court 17 days after the emergency application was fully briefed to issue the order\n\n### Voting Breakdown:\n- Five total opinions were issued in addition to the order itself\n- No opinion was joined by more than four justices\n- Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito provided no explanation for their votes\n- Justice Neil Gorsuch (joined by Justice Brett Kavanaugh) claimed lower courts are \"defy[ing]\" Supreme Court shadow docket rulings\n\n### Expert Analysis (cited in article):\n- **Chris Geidner and Steve Vladeck** both criticized Gorsuch's claim, noting that at least four of his colleagues disagreed with him about the meaning of a key shadow docket order\n- **Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson** noted in her opinion that the Court and individual justices have historically denied emergency relief applications routinely\n\n### Author's Arguments:\n- The Court is issuing shadow docket rulings without explanations because justices cannot agree on reasons\n- The Court may be applying a unique standard suggesting the government necessarily suffers irreparable harm when a lower court enjoins it from doing something\n- The lack of clear majority reasoning makes it difficult for lower courts to apply precedent (referencing the Marks v. United States standard)\n- The Court should be more reluctant to grant emergency relief\n\n**Note:** This article is an opinion piece analyzing Supreme Court procedures and does not report on any justice departures or changes to Court composition.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/04/supreme-court-hears-dispute-over-south-carolinas-bid-to-defund-planned-parenthood/\">\n# Summary of Article: Supreme Court hears dispute over South Carolina's bid to defund Planned Parenthood\n\n**Source:** SCOTUSblog, April 02, 2025, by Amy Howe\n\n**Note:** The article appears to be cut off at the end.\n\n## Key Facts and Context:\n\n- **Case Background:** In 2018, South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster ordered the state's Department of Health and Human Services to prohibit abortion clinics from participating in Medicaid, arguing that because money is fungible, any Medicaid funds to clinics where abortion is provided would effectively subsidize abortion.\n\n- **Lower Court Ruling:** The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit sided with Planned Parenthood and a Medicaid patient (Julie Edwards), ruling that the Medicaid Act creates individual rights enforceable under federal civil rights laws, and barred South Carolina from excluding Planned Parenthood from its Medicaid program.\n\n- **Medicaid Context:** The Medicaid program has provided medical care to more than 72 million Americans over 60 years. Federal law generally bars the use of Medicaid funds for abortions, but Planned Parenthood provides other medical services (gynecological care, cancer screenings, blood pressure and cholesterol screenings, birth control).\n\n## Oral Arguments - Justice Positions:\n\n**Justices appearing skeptical of South Carolina's position:**\n- **Justice Sonia Sotomayor:** Questioned the need for \"magic words\" to create enforceable rights; noted Congress's purpose was to prevent states from limiting patient choices; challenged the federal government's change in position, asking if they \"needed a hit over the head\" to understand precedent.\n- **Justice Elena Kagan:** Argued that imposing a \"magic words\" requirement would be \"changing the rules midstream\" for laws enacted long ago.\n- **Justice Amy Coney Barrett:** Questioned how denying a qualified provider deprives patients of their choice; asked whether this case represents an unusual circumstance or would \"open the floodgates\" of similar suits.\n\n**Justices appearing more sympathetic to South Carolina:**\n- **Justice Clarence Thomas:** Asked whether the word \"right\" is \"absolutely necessary\" to determine if a right has been created.\n- **Justice Brett Kavanaugh:** Expressed concern about lack of clear guidance for lower courts and stakeholders; sought specific words that would create privately enforceable rights to avoid \"another decade of litigation.\"\n\n## Arguments Presented:\n\n**South Carolina (John Bursch, Alliance Defending Freedom):** \n- Laws under Congress's spending clause power require \"clear rights-creating language\"\n- The \"any qualified provider\" provision lacks such language\n- Suggested words like \"right,\" \"entitlement,\" \"privilege,\" or \"immunities\" would be needed\n- Without limiting to specific words, \"the floodgates are open\"\n\n**Federal Government (Kyle Hawkins):**\n- The \"any qualified provider\" provision is a \"run-of-the-mill spending clause statute\"\n- Declined to specify exact words needed, but suggested looking for \"words that have a real rights-creating pedigree in our nation's history and legal traditions\"\n\n**Planned Parenthood (Nicole Saharsky):**\n- The provision \"uses mandatory, individual-centric, rights-creating language\"\n- \"The only thing it doesn't do is use the word 'right'\"\n- The Court has \"repeatedly said that magic words aren't required\"\n\n## Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\nThis article provides no direct information about potential changes to Supreme Court composition in 2026. It documents a current case before the Court but does not discuss Justice retirements, health issues, or potential changes to the number of seats.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.scotusblog.com/2026/01/looking-back-at-2025-the-supreme-court-and-the-trump-administration/\">\n# Summary of \"Looking back at 2025: the Supreme Court and the Trump administration\"\n\n**Source:** SCOTUSblog, January 5, 2026  \n**Author:** Erwin Chemerinsky\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Volume of litigation:** 358 lawsuits were filed challenging Trump administration actions through the end of December 2025.\n\n2. **Supreme Court rulings in favor of Trump administration:**\n   - Won the one case decided after full briefing and oral argument in 2025: *Trump v. CASA* (6-3 decision on nationwide injunctions)\n   - Won 20 out of 24 emergency docket cases involving Trump administration actions\n   - Lost 4 out of 24 emergency docket cases\n\n3. **Individual Justice voting patterns on emergency docket (24 cases):**\n   - Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson: Voted against Trump administration in all 24 cases\n   - Justice Sonia Sotomayor: Voted against Trump administration in 22 cases\n   - Justice Elena Kagan: Voted against Trump administration in 21 cases\n   - Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito: Voted against Trump administration only once (in *Margolin v. National Association of Immigration Judges*, which was unanimous)\n\n4. **Specific case outcomes:**\n   - Only one emergency docket case was unanimous: *Margolin v. National Association of Immigration Judges*\n   - *Noem v. National TPS Alliance* (May 2025): Involved ending Temporary Protected Status for \"hundreds of thousands of Venezuelan nationals\"\n   - *Noem v. Doe*: Involved revoking parole for 532,000 non-citizens from Cuba, Haiti, Nicaragua, and Venezuela\n   - *Department of State v. AIDS Vaccine Advocacy Coalition*: Trump administration lost 5-4; involved nearly $2 billion in reimbursements to nonprofits and businesses\n   - *Department of Education v. California* (April 4): Trump administration won 5-4; involved $65 million in teacher training grants\n   - Chief Justice John Roberts joined liberal justices in dissent in funding termination cases\n\n## Key Opinions:\n\n**From the author (Erwin Chemerinsky):**\n- \"No president in history has challenged constitutional limits or sought to increase presidential power in the way that President Donald Trump has in this term in office.\"\n- \"Never before has the court been asked to rule on the legality of so many presidential actions in such a short period of time.\"\n- \"During the first year of this Trump presidency, the Supreme Court overwhelmingly sided with the Trump administration.\"\n\n**From Justice Jackson (quoted dissent):**\n- Described the Court's approach as \"Calvinball jurisprudence with a twist\" (referencing Calvin and Hobbes cartoon), stating: \"Calvinball has only one rule: There are no fixed rules. We seem to have two: that one, and this Administration always wins.\"\n\n**Note:** The article appears to be cut off at the end, so the summary of the final two cases (*A.A.R.P. v. Trump* and one other) is incomplete.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve the Metaculus community-prediction time series for question 41072 during Jan\u2013Feb 2026 and list any associated news events about retirements or court-expansion bills in that interval\n1. Metaculus community-prediction time series (question #41072, \u201cWill the composition of the US Supreme Court change in 2026?\u201d)  \n\nThe search results delivered only a single data-point: 23.00 % on 2026-02-16 (question page snapshot). They did not include the historical record of daily or intraday community predictions for January-February 2026.  Therefore the day-by-day (or even week-by-week) trajectory of the probability between 2026-01-01 and 2026-02-28 remains unknown from the material retrieved.  A complete answer will require access to the question\u2019s \u201cprediction-timeseries\u201d endpoint of the Metaculus API or to a third-party archival site that stores the full history for question #41072.  Without those data the following analysis cannot quantify the magnitude or timing of any shifts, nor can it correlate individual news events with specific percentage changes.\n\n2. News events from 1 Jan 2026 \u2013 28 Feb 2026 that could plausibly influence forecasts about a Supreme Court vacancy or a seat-expansion bill\n\nA. Possible U.S. Supreme Court retirement signals  \n   \u2022 6 Feb 2026 \u2013 The Nation ran an opinion column arguing that Justice Samuel Alito\u2019s planned October 2026 book launch is \u201ca giant tell\u201d that he will retire at the end of the Court\u2019s 2025-26 Term (Nation, 6 Feb 2026).  \n   \u2022 13 Feb 2026 \u2013 Slate\u2019s Amicus podcast devoted an episode to \u201cnew speculation\u201d that Alito is \u201ceyeing the exits,\u201d citing the same book date and a favorable forthcoming biography, and discussing how President Trump and a GOP-held Senate could replace him (Slate, 13 Feb 2026).\n\n   Although neither piece announces an official retirement\u2014they are speculative\u2014both received national attention and were shared widely on legal and political Twitter.  Because the Metaculus community often reacts to credible speculation about Supreme Court retirements, these two media bursts are the most likely Jan-Feb catalysts for any upward bumps in the probability.\n\n   No official resignation, death, or new health disclosure involving any sitting justice was reported in the interval.  Nor did any federal court-expansion legislation targeting the nine-member Supreme Court advance in Congress during January or February 2026.\n\nB. Court-expansion (state level) legislation  \n   While the Metaculus question is keyed to the U.S. Supreme Court, some forecasters monitor state \u201ccourt-packing\u201d stories as leading indicators of a broader political appetite for judicial restructuring.  Two Utah bills made national legal news:\n\n   \u2022 30\u201331 Jan 2026 \u2013 Utah\u2019s Republican legislature passed, and Governor Spencer Cox signed, SB 134, expanding the Utah Supreme Court from five to seven justices and adding lower-court seats (Deseret News, 31 Jan 2026; Salt Lake Tribune, 31 Jan 2026).  This is the first state-court expansion since 2016.  Passage occurred quickly (House vote 57\u201318) and was criticized by Democrats and by the Utah judiciary for diverting resources from over-burdened trial courts.\n\n   \u2022 5 Feb 2026 \u2013 The Utah State Bar publicly criticized SB 134 as unnecessary \u201ccourt-packing\u201d and said the funds should be used for clerks and district courts instead (Utah Public Radio, 5 Feb 2026).  The press conference kept the story in the headlines and may have reminded forecasters that judicial expansion can be enacted swiftly when one party controls both the legislative and executive branches.\n\n   No federal bills to enlarge the nine-seat U.S. Supreme Court were introduced or advanced during Jan-Feb 2026, and no White House statements on the issue were reported.\n\nC. Retirements in lower courts (context, but unlikely to affect the Metaculus probability)  \n   State-level judicial retirements were numerous\u2014Delaware (Justice Valihura, retirement effective July 2026, State of Delaware News, 6 Jan 2026), North Dakota (Justice Crothers, retirement effective 28 Feb 2026, ND Governor\u2019s Office), and several listed by Ballotpedia (Ballotpedia, 2 Feb 2026).  These departures have no direct bearing on the U.S. Supreme Court but may contribute marginally to background discourse about judicial turnover.\n\n3. Synthesis\n\n\u2022 Confirmed data: The community prediction stood at 23.00 % on 16 Feb 2026.  \n\u2022 Missing data: the daily values from 1 Jan through 15 Feb and from 17 Feb through 28 Feb.  Those numbers are required to judge whether the probability \u201cspiked\u201d after the Alito-retirement speculation (6\u201313 Feb) or after the Utah court-expansion news (late Jan \u2013 early Feb).  Without them we cannot quantify the direction or magnitude of community reaction.\n\n\u2022 Best-guess qualitative impact:  \n  \u2013 Late January Utah stories likely had, at most, a mild upward effect, because they concern a state court; historically Metaculus forecasters weigh state actions as only weak signals for federal expansion.  \n  \u2013 The first week of February brought national speculation about a conservative justice\u2019s strategic retirement.  Such rumors, especially focused on Alito, have triggered prior probability jumps of 2\u20134 percentage points in similar Metaculus questions.  The two closely spaced national stories (Nation 6 Feb, Slate 13 Feb) therefore probably produced the most noticeable intra-month movement.\n\n4. Remaining information gap\n\nThe core quantitative requirement\u2014\u201cthe Metaculus community-prediction time series for January\u2013February 2026\u201d\u2014is absent.  Access to the Metaculus API (endpoint  .../questions/41072/prediction-timeseries/ ) or a secondary dataset is indispensable to supply:\n\n\u2022 Date/time stamp (preferably UTC)  \n\u2022 Community prediction (probability)  \n\u2022 Number of active forecasts (optional but helpful)  \n\nOnly with that table can one align inflection points to  (a) 31 Jan passage of Utah SB 134, (b) 6 Feb Nation article, (c) 13 Feb Slate episode, and verify whether the percentage exceeded or stayed below the 23 % threshold before 28 Feb 2026.</Agent_report>\n"
