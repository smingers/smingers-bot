Jackson Women's Health Organization ruling in June 2022 overturned Roe v. Wade, eliminating the federal constitutional right to abortion.\n\n2. **Current State of Abortion Bans:**\n   - 41 states have abortion bans in effect with only limited exceptions\n   - 9 states and the District of Columbia do not restrict abortion based on gestational duration\n\n3. **Historical Context:** Research indicates abortion bans disproportionately impact marginalized groups and individuals facing systemic racism and other forms of oppression.\n\n## Key Definitions Provided:\n\n- **Gestational duration:** Typically defined as weeks since last menstrual period (LMP), used by state legislation to define timelines for abortion bans\n- **Viability:** Generally determined to be between 24-26 weeks LMP; a nonmedical term describing when a fetus can survive outside the uterus\n- **Exception categories:** Include general health (may include mental/emotional health), physical health (restricted to bodily functions), and lethal fetal anomaly\n\n## Important Observations:\n\nThe article notes that most exceptions to abortion bans are \"designed to be unworkable, containing vague and contradictory language and imposing cumbersome requirements.\" The inclusion of an exception does not ensure provider availability or willingness to perform procedures.\n\n**Note:** This article provides background information on the state of abortion bans following Dobbs but does not contain information directly relevant to predicting Supreme Court composition changes or Metaculus community prediction movements.\n</QuestionSource>\n"
