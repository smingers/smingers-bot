- Relevance: DIRECT - discusses exact security and provides current yield estimate of 2.46%

**FRED Series Page:**
- Quality: Primary source
- Administrative metadata only, no predictive value

**Treasury Interest Rate Statistics (Dec 23, 2025):**
- Quality: High - official methodology
- Date: Outdated (Dec 2025)
- Relevance: Background only, no current data

**Scotsman Guide Article (Sep 16, 2025):**
- Quality: Moderate
- Date: 5 months old
- Relevance: Minimal - discusses Fed policy and mortgage rates, not TIPS

**CNBC Article (Feb 4, 2026):**
- Quality: High - major financial news
- Date: 13 days before forecast
- Key Facts: 10-year Treasury at 4.276%, 30-year at 4.917% (nominal, not TIPS)
- Relevance: Provides nominal yield context but not TIPS-specific

**Fidelity Bond Outlook (2026):**
- Quality: High - major investment firm
- Date: Early 2026
- Key Facts: Bonds returned ~7% in 2025, Fed cut rates ~2 percentage points
- Expert Opinion (Multiple): Starting yields "relatively high," bonds at "fair value"

**AskNews Articles:**
- Multiple articles on general Treasury yields (Feb 16-17, 2026)
- Key Pattern: 10-year Treasury yields falling to ~4.05% (multi-month lows), markets pricing 2 Fed cuts in 2026
- Relevance: Moderate - shows broader Treasury rally context

**Critical Data Point from TIPSWatch:** The article explicitly states the Treasury's estimate for the 30-year TIPS real yield is 2.46% as of the auction announcement (likely Feb 13-14, 2026). This is 2 bps lower than the FRED data point of 2.48% from Feb 12.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- TIPSWatch reports Treasury estimate of 2.46% for upcoming auction (identifiable source, direct measurement, published Feb 16)
- FRED data shows current level at 2.48% as of Feb 12
- TIPSWatch reports 30-year real yield down 17 bps since Feb 2
- Multiple sources confirm broader Treasury rally with 10-year yields at multi-month lows (~4.05%)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Strong 30-year auction demand reported (Detroit News article via outside view)
- Market pricing 2 Fed rate cuts in 2026 (multiple AskNews sources)
- Inflation data softer than expected (January CPI 2.4% vs 2.7% prior)
- Current level (2.48%) at 30-day minimum suggests potential support

**Weak Evidence:**
- Expert opinions on "historically attractive" yields (subjective assessment)
- General bond market sentiment (not TIPS-specific)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** Feb 17 to Feb 25 = 8 calendar days = 6 business days

**Key Events in Window:**
- Feb 20 (Thursday): 30-year TIPS auction
- Feb 27 (Friday): Auction settlement (AFTER resolution date)

**Timeframe Sensitivity:**
- If halved (3 business days): Would expect minimal movement, likely stay 2.46-2.50%
- If doubled (12 business days): Would include auction settlement, potentially wider range 2.40-2.55%

The auction on Feb 20 is critical - it will establish market clearing yield 5 days before resolution. However, the DFII30 series reflects secondary market yields, not auction results directly.

## (d) Justification

**Factors Shifting from Outside View:**

1. **Strong Downward Pressure (Major shift):**
   - Treasury's own estimate is 2.46%, 2 bps below current 2.48%
   - Broader Treasury rally ongoing (10-year at 4.05%, down from 4.28%)
   - 30-year real yield already down 17 bps in first half of February
   - Softer inflation data supporting lower real yields

2. **Auction Dynamics (Moderate shift):**
   - Feb 20 auction will set price discovery
   - Strong demand expected based on recent auction performance
   - TIPSWatch expert notes "historically attractive" levels, suggesting buying interest
   - Auction expected near 2.5% per TIPSWatch, but Treasury estimate 2.46%

3. **Mean Reversion Pressure (Weak countervailing force):**
   - 30-day mean of 2.58% suggests upward pull
   - Current level at 30-day minimum
   - However, this is overwhelmed by current momentum

**Critical Insight:** The Treasury's own estimate of 2.46% (published Feb 16) is more current than the Feb 12 FRED data of 2.48%. This suggests the market has already moved lower in the 4 days since the last FRED data point. The resolution date (Feb 25) is 5 days after the auction, giving time for post-auction price discovery.

**Revised Assessment:** The outside view assumed mean reversion toward 2.58%, but current evidence suggests continued downward momentum toward 2.40-2.50% range. The Treasury estimate of 2.46% should anchor the distribution, with auction results potentially pushing slightly lower if demand is strong.

Distribution calibration:

Given the strong evidence of continued downward pressure:
- Treasury estimate of 2.46% (most recent reliable data point)
- Broader Treasury rally continuing
- Auction likely to clear near or below 2.46%
- 6 business days allows for post-auction adjustment

The distribution should center near 2.46% with:
- Downside risk to 2.40-2.43% if auction shows very strong demand
- Upside risk to 2.50-2.54% if auction disappoints or mean reversion occurs
- Low probability of returning to 2.58% given momentum

Adjusting from outside view's 2.49-2.52% median to 2.44-2.47% median range:

Percentile 10: Should capture strong auction scenario → 2.40%
Percentile 20: Modest additional decline → 2.43%
Percentile 40: Near Treasury estimate → 2.46%
Percentile 60: Slight upward drift post-auction → 2.48%
Percentile 80: Mean reversion begins → 2.51%
Percentile 90: Stronger mean reversion → 2.54%

Checklist:

1. **Target Variable:** DFII30 (30-year TIPS real yield) value on Feb 25, 2026, in percent units, 8-day forecast window.

2. **Base Rate Check:** Outside view centered 2.49-2.52% with mean reversion bias. Inside view shifts down to 2.44-2.47% based on Treasury estimate (2.46%) and ongoing rally. Justified by strong directional evidence.

3. **Consistency Check:** Implied median = 2.47%; mean ≈ 2.47%. This aligns with Treasury estimate of 2.46% plus modest upward drift, consistent with current momentum and auction dynamics.

4. **Key Evidence:**
   - Treasury's Feb 16 estimate: 2.46% (factual, official)
   - 30-year real yield down 17 bps since Feb 2 (factual, TIPSWatch)
   - Broader Treasury rally: 10-year at 4.05%, multi-month low (factual, multiple sources)
   - Feb 20 auction expected near 2.5% with strong demand (expert assessment, TIPSWatch)

5. **Blind Spot:** Unexpected inflation data or Fed hawkish surprise could reverse Treasury rally, pushing yields UP toward 2.55-2.60%. However, no Fed meeting or major data releases scheduled before Feb 25.

6. **Status Quo:** Current level 2.48% (Feb 12), but Treasury estimate 2.46% (Feb 16) suggests already moved lower. Status quo is 2.46%, not 2.48%. Short timeframe (6 business days) limits movement, supporting tight distribution around 2.46%.

7. **Technicalities:** Values strictly increasing, units in Percent, bounds are OPEN (can exceed 1.92-3.11 range). Values reasonable given recent range of 2.48-2.74%.
