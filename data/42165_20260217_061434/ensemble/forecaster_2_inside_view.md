Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary/High-Quality Sources:**
- **FRED metadata & Agent report (17 Feb 2026)**: Machine-generated from official Federal Reserve data. Last value 2.48% on 12 Feb 2026. 30-day mean 2.58%, σ=0.04%, largest 1-day move -7bp. Factual, highly reliable, most recent.
- **TipsWatch article (16 Feb 2026)**: David Enna discusses upcoming 30-year TIPS auction (20 Feb). Treasury estimate: 2.46% real yield. States 30-year real yield down ~17bp since 2 Feb 2026, currently at historically attractive levels. Factual auction details with expert opinion from identifiable source.
- **CNBC article (4 Feb 2026)**: Reports 30-year Treasury yield at 4.917% (nominal). Bret Kenwell (eToro) provides opinion on jobs data. Factual but dated (13 days old), covers nominal not real yields.

**Moderate-Quality Sources:**
- **AskNews articles (15-17 Feb 2026)**: Multiple reports show US 10-year Treasury yield falling to ~4.05% (multi-month low) following soft January CPI (2.4% annual, down from 2.7%). Markets pricing in two Fed rate cuts for 2026. Consistent across multiple sources. Factual with some expert opinions (Molly Brooks/TD Securities, Jonathan Cohn/Nomura).
- **Fidelity outlook (late 2025/early 2026)**: Multiple experts (Hofschire, Weinstein, Plage) discuss fair value for Treasuries, high starting yields. Directional guidance but not specific to DFII30.

**Lower-Quality/Tangential Sources:**
- **Scotsman Guide (16 Sep 2025)**: 5+ months old, discusses Fed rate cuts and mortgage rates. Mark Zandi, Doug Duncan opinions outdated for current forecast.
- **Various international bond articles**: Cover Indian, European, Chinese markets. Provide context on global Treasury demand but indirect relevance.

**Key Factual Findings:**
1. DFII30 at 2.48% on 12 Feb (5 days ago)
2. 30-day mean 2.58%, recent decline of ~17bp since early Feb
3. Upcoming 30-year TIPS auction 20 Feb with Treasury estimate 2.46%
4. January CPI softer than expected (2.4% annual), supporting rate-cut expectations
5. Nominal 10-year yield at ~4.05%, 30-year nominal ~4.69-4.80%
6. Light macro calendar until late Feb (no major catalysts between now and 25 Feb)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Treasury auction estimate (2.46%)**: Official Treasury pre-auction estimate for 20 Feb auction is highly reliable. Auctions typically settle within 5-10bp of estimates. This suggests market clearing level near 2.46-2.50% mid-week. *Weight: High, directional toward lower bound of outside view.*

- **Recent 17bp decline from early Feb**: Multiple independent sources confirm downward trend. TipsWatch reports decline from ~2.63% (early Feb) to 2.46% (mid-Feb). Agent data shows 30-day mean 2.58% vs current 2.48%. *Weight: Strong, confirms downward momentum.*

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Soft January CPI supporting dovish Fed expectations**: Multiple sources report CPI at 2.4% (below 2.5% forecast), markets pricing two 2026 rate cuts. Real yields typically decline when Fed easing expectations strengthen. *Weight: Moderate, supports lower yields but effect may be partially priced in.*

- **Light calendar through 25 Feb**: No major scheduled data releases or Fed meetings between now and resolution date. Reduces probability of large shocks. *Weight: Moderate, supports mean-reversion/stability.*

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Historical volatility patterns**: Agent reports largest 1-day move in past month was -7bp. Suggests daily moves typically <5bp absent major catalysts. *Weight: Weak to moderate, informs volatility estimate.*

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Forecast horizon**: 8 calendar days (6 business days) from 17 Feb to 25 Feb.

**Key events in window:**
- 20 Feb (Thu): 30-year TIPS auction at 1pm EST
- 27 Feb (Fri): Auction settlement (after resolution date)
- No major macro releases scheduled

**Timeframe sensitivity:**
- **If halved (3 business days)**: Would expect tighter distribution around current 2.48%, σ~0.08%. Auction on 20 Feb would be primary driver, likely pulling toward 2.46% estimate.
- **If doubled (12 business days)**: Would widen distribution significantly (σ~0.15%), increase probability of Fed communication or surprise data affecting yields. Would shift median closer to 30-day mean (2.58%).

**Current 6-day horizon**: Auction is the main scheduled event. Post-auction, yields typically stabilize near clearing level. Resolution date (25 Feb) is 3 business days post-auction, allowing time for market to digest results.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view established**: Median 2.52%, 10th-90th range [2.32, 2.72], based on 6-day σ~0.11% and mild mean-reversion toward 2.55%.

**Adjustments warranted:**

1. **Treasury auction estimate (2.46%) is strong anchor**: Official estimates are highly accurate predictors of auction clearing levels. With auction on 20 Feb and resolution 25 Feb, the 2.46% level becomes a strong attractor. This pulls median down from 2.52% to ~2.48%.

2. **Recent downward momentum (-17bp over 2 weeks)**: Multiple sources confirm trend from ~2.63% to 2.48%. While some mean-reversion is expected, momentum suggests bias toward lower end of range. This compresses upper tail slightly.

3. **Light calendar reduces tail risk**: Absence of major catalysts through 25 Feb reduces probability of >20bp moves. This justifies tightening 10th-90th range from [2.32, 2.72] to approximately [2.35, 2.62].

4. **Auction volatility consideration**: Day-of and day-after auction can see 5-10bp intraday swings, but by 25 Feb (3 days post-auction) markets typically stabilize. Modest increase in short-term volatility around 20-21 Feb, but resolution date allows settling.

**Final calibration logic:**
- Median shifts down to 2.48% (current level, reinforced by auction estimate)
- 20th-80th percentiles tighten to [2.42, 2.55] reflecting reduced uncertainty
- 10th-90th widen slightly to [2.35, 2.62] to account for auction volatility and unknown unknows
- Distribution remains roughly symmetric but with slight negative skew (easier to fall on dovish surprise than rise on hawkish surprise given recent CPI)

## Distribution Calibration

**Central tendency**: Current spot 2.48% and auction estimate 2.46% provide strong anchors. Median at 2.48%.

**Volatility assessment**: 
- Historical 6-day σ ≈ 0.11% suggests 68% confidence interval of ±11bp
- Recent 30-day σ = 0.04% (4bp) suggests lower recent volatility
- Auction adds temporary volatility but resolves before 25 Feb
- Blended estimate: σ ≈ 0.09% for this specific window

**Distribution shape**:
- 40th percentile: 2.45% (slightly below median, reflecting downward bias)
- 60th percentile: 2.51% (above median, allowing for mean-reversion)
- 20th-80th span: 13bp [2.42, 2.55]
- 10th-90th span: 27bp [2.35, 2.62]

**Tail considerations**:
- 10th percentile (2.35%): Requires ~13bp drop from current. Possible if auction comes in very strong or surprise dovish Fed communication. Probability ~10%.
- 90th percentile (2.62%): Requires ~14bp rise from current. Would need hawkish surprise or risk-off reversal. Less likely given recent momentum. Probability ~10%.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: DFII30 value on 25 Feb 2026, in percent, 8 days from now. ✓ Aligned.

2. **Base rate**: Outside view median 2.52%, range [2.32, 2.72]. Final prediction shifts median to 2.48% based on strong auction anchor and recent momentum. Justified by high-quality evidence. ✓

3. **Consistency**: Implied median = 2.48%; mean ≈ 2.49% (slight positive skew from wider upper tail). Aligns with current spot, auction estimate, and recent downward trend. ✓

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Treasury auction estimate 2.46% (20 Feb) - highly reliable official guidance
   - Current spot 2.48% (12 Feb) with 30-day mean 2.58% - factual FRED data
   - Recent 17bp decline since early Feb - confirmed by multiple sources
   - Soft January CPI (2.4%) supporting dovish expectations - factual BLS data
   - Light macro calendar through 25 Feb - reduces tail risk

5. **Blind spot**: Geopolitical shock or surprise Fed communication between now and 25 Feb could drive yields up 15-25bp (flight to quality could push down, but real yields less sensitive than nominal). Would push outcome toward 90th percentile or above. Probability <5%.

6. **Status quo**: Current 2.48% is very recent (5 days old). With auction estimate at 2.46%, status quo outcome is 2.46-2.48%. Median at 2.48% appropriately weights this. ✓

7. **Technicalities**: Values strictly increasing, units in percent, all within bounds [1.92, 3.11]. ✓
