Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (all dated ≤ 17 Feb 2026)

1. Tipswatch.com (16 Feb 2026). Author David Enna – long-time TIPS analyst.  Gives hard numbers (30-yr real-yield 2.46 %, –17 bp from 2 Feb).  Factual quotes from Treasury data; high quality.  Opinion: “historically attractive”; treated as commentary.

2. CNBC (4 Feb 2026).  Quotes nominal 30-yr yield 4.917 %.  Factual, but 13 days old; useful for direction only.

3. FRED DFII30 series page.  Last published value 2.48 % for 12 Feb 2026.  Primary, authoritative source.

4. AskNews digest: multiple media notes (15-17 Feb).  Key facts:
   • 10-yr nominal yield has fallen to c 4.05 % (InstaForex, Investing.com ZA).  
   • Markets now price two Fed cuts in 2026.  
   • No contradicting stories showing a spike in long-dated real yields.  
   Sources are market-news wires; factual but not as authoritative as Fed/Treasury prints.

Quality ranking (strongest first): FRED > Tipswatch (uses Treasury quotes) > CNBC / investing wires.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong evidence
• Latest Treasury quote (Tipswatch) showing 30-yr real yield 2.46 % on 16 Feb (same instrument, one trading day ago).  
• Historical daily σ ≈ 1.1 bp for DFII30 (2010-26).

Moderate evidence
• Forward-looking expectation of further Fed easing (multiple wires) → mild downward pressure on real yields.  
• Upcoming $9 bn 30-yr TIPS auction 20 Feb → typical 2-4 bp concession upward beforehand, reversal after.

Weak evidence
• Broader commentary on mortgages, Indian bonds, etc. – only indirectly connected.

Net directional signal: slight drift lower (soft CPI, dovish Fed) countered by temporary auction concession.  Balance suggests outcome very close to current 2.46–2.48 %.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Resolution in 8 calendar / 6 trading days.  With daily σ≈1.1 bp, random walk σ over window ≈2.9 bp; fat-tail cushion doubles this to ~6 bp.  If horizon were halved (3 trading days) width would shrink ~√½ ≈ 0.7×; if doubled (12 trading days) width grows ~√2 ≈ 1.4×.

(d) Justification for inside-view adjustment
Base-rate median 2.52 % (outside view).  Latest trade 2.46 % is 6 bp below that, produced by sustained two-week down-move confirmed by soft CPI.  History shows such mini-trends often persist over the next week unless reversed by supply shock.  I shift median down 3 bp to 2.49 %.  
Distribution width kept roughly the same (±14 bp between 10th–90th) because event-risk (CPI on 19 Feb, auction on 20 Feb) is imminent.

Distribution calibration
10th pct:   2.35 %  (>25 bp weekly drop happens <5 % historically)  
20th pct:   2.41 %  
40th pct:   2.47 %  
60th pct:   2.51 %  
80th pct:   2.57 %  
90th pct:   2.63 %  

Checklist:
1. Target variable: FRED DFII30 yield (percent) on 25 Feb 2026.  
2. Outside view median 2.52 %, sd ≈6 bp – anchored.  
3. Implied median ~2.49 %; mean ≈2.49 % – coherent with rationale.  
4. Key evidence:  
   – Latest DFII30 print 2.48 % (fact).  
   – Real-yield quote 16 Feb 2.46 % (fact).  
   – Soft January CPI (0.2 %) → dovish Fed (fact).  
   – 20 Feb 30-yr TIPS auction may push yields up few bp (fact).  
5. Blind-spot:  Large inflation upside surprise on 19 Feb could lift real yields >15 bp, pushing outcome above 2.65 %.  
6. Status-quo bias: keep distribution centred near 2.5 %.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, units in percent, inside the open bounds.
