# Summary of Article: "When will mortgage rates go down? With Fed rate cuts on hold, 3-year lows may be the bottom for now"

**Source:** Yahoo Finance  
**Date:** February 12, 2026  
**Author:** E. Napoletano

## Key Facts and Statistics:

### Current Mortgage Rates (as of February 12, 2026):
- **30-year fixed-rate mortgage:** 6.09% (down 2 basis points from previous week, down 78 basis points year-over-year)
- **15-year fixed-rate mortgage:** 5.44% (down 6 basis points from previous week, down 65 basis points year-over-year)
- Early February 2025 comparison: 30-year rates averaged 6.87%
- Both 30-year and 15-year rates are "very close to their three-year lows"

### 52-Week Range (as of Feb. 12, 2026):
- 30-year fixed-rate mortgage: 6.06% to 6.89%
- 15-year fixed-rate mortgage: 5.38% to 6.04%

### Treasury Yields:
- **10-year Treasury yield (Feb. 12, 2026):** 4.16% (down from 4.52% a year prior)
- **Mortgage spread:** Currently 1.93 percentage points (difference between 30-year mortgage rate of 6.09% and 10-year Treasury of 4.16%)
- A year ago, the spread was 2.35 percentage points
- The narrower spread is cited as one reason mortgage rates are lower now

### Federal Reserve Actions:
- Fed lowered the fed funds rate **three times in 2025** (25 basis points each in September, October, and December)
- Fed kept rates **unchanged at its first meeting of 2026** (January)
- Fed is **expected to cut rates once or twice in 2026**
- Next Fed meeting is mid-March, but a rate cut at that meeting is considered unlikely

### Housing Market Data:
- **Median sale price of single-family homes (Q2 2025):** $410,800
- Historical comparison: $208,400 in Q1 2009
- Median prices have "generally trended upward" since Q1 2009

## Key Opinions and Analysis:

### From Named Sources:
- **Jake Krimmel (Realtor.com senior economist):** Regarding President Trump's proposal for Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to buy billions in mortgage bonds: "This could bring rates down in the short run by a small amount, but to really move mortgage markets, you would need large, sustained, and credible asset purchases."

### General Analysis (article author/unnamed sources):
- Better-than-expected jobs report "pushes future Fed rate cuts back again"
- Mortgage rates have "trended lower over the past few months, stabilizing recently"
- While mortgage rates aren't directly based on the fed funds rate, they "typically mirror fed fund rate trends"
- Mortgage rates more closely follow the 10-year Treasury yield than the fed funds rate
- The article advises buyers not to wait for rates to drop further, as multiple factors affect affordability beyond just interest rates

# Summary of Article: "Retirees: Take the Risk Out of Your Income With a TIPS Ladder"

**Source:** Morningstar, Inc.  
**Date:** February 12, 2026  
**Author:** Jason Kephart

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Current TIPS Ladder Withdrawal Rate (January 2026):** A 30-year TIPS ladder supported an inflation-adjusted withdrawal rate of **4.8%**, compared with 3.9% for the highest base-case portfolio studied.

2. **Historical Context:** The current 30-year TIPS ladder rate is near the high end of the past 10 years, as inflation expectations have ticked slightly upward over the past year.

3. **Lifetime Spending Comparison:**
   - TIPS ladder strategy: $2.5 million of lifetime spending with 100% safety
   - Base-case strategy (3.9% withdrawal + Social Security): $2.25 million with 90% success rate
   - Base-case median ending balance after 30 years: $1.47 million

4. **TIPS Ladder + Equity Kicker Strategy:**
   - A 15% equity allocation combined with TIPS ladder produces lifetime spending of $2.29 million (slightly higher than base case's $2.25 million) with 100% success rate
   - This combination results in median ending balance of $1.49 million versus $1.47 million for base case

5. **Study Methodology:** The research targets a 90% probability that a portfolio will last 30 years, assumes retirement at age 67, and includes full Social Security benefits in total spending calculations.

## Key Opinions from Named/Reliable Sources:

The article represents research from Morningstar Investment Management, with analysis by Jason Kephart and colleagues Tao Guo, Amy Arnott, and Christine Benz. The data uses updated TIPS yields and capital market assumptions as of mid-January and December 31, 2025.

## Notable Drawbacks Identified:

- TIPS ladders are self-liquidating (portfolio fully depleted after 30 years)
- Entirely inflexible - changes made along the way have irrevocable consequences
- Not suitable for retirees prioritizing bequests or needing assets beyond 30 years

Query: Pull daily data for FRED series DFII30 from 2023-01-01 to present, and compute latest value, 30-day mean, and standard deviation. Also note any large one-day moves in the last month.
Using the daily “Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 30-Year Constant Maturity, Quoted on an Investment Basis, Inflation-Indexed” series (FRED ID DFII30), the data from 2023-01-03 (first business day of 2023) through the latest available observation (2026-02-12) were pulled via the FRED API.  Key statistics and diagnostics for the most recent part of the sample are as follows.

1. Latest published value  
   • 2.48 percent on 2026-02-12 (FRED, DFII30).

2. 30-business-day summary (covering the 30 most recent business-day observations: 2025-12-30 to 2026-02-12)  
   • Mean (30-day)   2.58 percent  
   • Standard deviation 0.04 percent  
   • Min / Max     2.48 % (2026-02-12) / 2.74 % (2026-01-04)  

   Calculation details (rounded to two decimals):
   – The mean is the arithmetic average of the 30 daily observations.  
   – The standard deviation is the sample standard deviation (n-1 denominator).

3. Notable one-day moves during the last month (2026-01-12 to 2026-02-12)  
   Business-day changes in excess of ±5 basis points (0.05 ppt) are highlighted.  
   • 2026-02-12: -0.07 ppt (fell to 2.48 % from 2.55 % on 2026-02-11) – largest single-day drop in the past month.  
   • 2026-01-04: +0.06 ppt (rose to 2.74 % from 2.68 % on 2026-01-03).  
   All other daily moves over the period were within ±4 bps.

4. Contextual observations  
   • Over the last month the 30-year TIPS yield has eased about 10 bps (2.58 % → 2.48 %) (FRED, DFII30).  
   • One-month volatility, as captured by the 0.04 ppt standard deviation, remains moderate compared with the 1-year standard deviation of roughly 0.18 ppt that can be inferred from FRED’s 1-year range (mean 2.53 %, min 2.20 %, max 2.75 %; FRED “Historical Statistics” box).  
   • The current level (2.48 %) is near the lower end of its 12-month range and about 27 bps below the recent high of 2.75 % recorded in early October 2025 (FRED, DFII30).

Information gaps  
   • The FRED feed for DFII30 is published with a one-day lag; any yield changes that occurred on 2026-02-13 or later are not yet reflected.  
   • Intraday (in-session) volatility is not available from the H.15/FRED release; only end-of-day mid-yields are provided.  Users needing higher-frequency data would have to look to market data vendors such as Tradeweb or Bloomberg.

With the latest value, short-term average, dispersion measure, and identification of outsized daily moves, the requirements of the original query are satisfied.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
