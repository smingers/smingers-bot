Analysis:
The DFII30 series represents the real (inflation-indexed) 30-year Treasury yield. Over the next eight days the main drivers will be: 
• Expectations for the February 23 CPI release (which can alter real-rate expectations).  
• Any Fed communications (FOMC minutes on Feb 19, speeches) that shift the policy-rate path.  
• Treasury market technicals (upcoming 30-year TIPS reopening auction on Feb 22, dealer positioning, demand from pension funds).  
• Broader macro news affecting the long-end real rate (growth surprises, risk sentiment).  

Therefore, the most useful current articles will discuss 30-year TIPS yield behaviour, Fed outlook, inflation expectations, and details of the imminent TIPS auction.
