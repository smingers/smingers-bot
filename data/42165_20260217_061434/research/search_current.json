The 10-year benchmark bond yield was at 6.6693 percent, slightly up from 6.666 percent in the previous session. Investors remained cautious due to a supply glut, despite recent bond price gains driven by the government's debt switch from 2027 to 2040 bonds. Traders expect yields to remain elevated, as the government anticipates significant gross issuance in the next fiscal year, raising concerns that demand may not match supply. A softer-than-expected inflation print in January\u2014within the Reserve Bank of India\u2019s (RBI) mandated band under the 2024 framework\u2014prevented an upward bias in treasury yields.

The Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index for investment-grade bonds rose to 510 points, its highest level since March 2022, reflecting strong buying pressure. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell to 4.05%, nearly 30 basis points below their 2026 peak in mid-January, while German bunds dropped to 2.76% and Spanish 10-year bonds fell below 3.2%. Shorter-duration U.S. bonds saw the largest price increases and yield declines, with 12-month U.S. debt at 3.43%\u2014its lowest level since July 2022. This shift is attributed to a dovish market outlook, reduced risk appetite, and strong demand for corporate bonds, particularly from tech giants like Alphabet, which raised $20 billion with a bond offering attracting over \u20ac100 billion in demand. The market also reacted to expectations that Kevin Warsh, the likely successor to Jerome Powell, may accelerate monetary easing. As of February 16, 2026, a diversified investment-grade bond portfolio would yield 1.7% annually, outperforming the German DAX and S&P 500, which are projected to deliver losses for European investors. According to TD Securities\u2019 Molly Brooks, the bond rally reflects declining risk perception, while Nomura\u2019s Jonathan Cohn noted that recent economic data alone cannot fully explain the rally, underscoring the role of risk-off behavior.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:00 PM\nSource:[elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/mercados-cotizaciones/noticias/13778845/02/26/el-mercado-de-bonos-se-adelanta-a-la-fed-y-descuenta-dos-recortes-de-tipos-de-interes-para-2026.html)\n\n**BTp Yield Holds at 3.37%, Spread with Bund Stabilizes at 61 Basis Points**\nThe Italian 10-year government bond (BTp) closed unchanged at a yield of 3.37%, matching Friday's closing level, according to Il Sole 24 Ore. This reflects a continued slowdown in medium- to long-term bond yields across the Eurozone and U.S. Treasury markets during the first half of February 2026. The spread between the Italian BTp and the German Bund with the same maturity stood at 61 basis points at the end of trading, aligning with Friday's figure. Market activity was limited due to reduced participation from American investors, who were absent because of the U.S. Presidents' Day holiday.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 05:18 PM\nSource:[Il Sole 24 ORE](https://www.ilsole24ore.com/radiocor/nRC_16.02.2026_17.49_41910419)\n\n**U.S. Treasury Bonds: Is Now the Time to Buy or Sell?**\nThe article analyzes the current state of U.S. Treasury bonds amid uncertainty over Federal Reserve interest rate cuts. It notes that the 10-year Treasury yield has dropped sharply from a high of 4.28%-4.29% to around 4.05%, approaching a key psychological and technical threshold near 3.94%, which could signal a shift from weakness to potential strengthening in bond prices. Inflation data from January 2026 shows a slowdown, with headline inflation at 2.4% annually\u2014down from 2.7% in December\u2014driven by a 7.5% year-on-year drop in fuel prices and a 2% decline in used car prices. However, energy costs rose significantly (+9.8% for gas, +6.3% for electricity), and food prices increased by 2.9%, while airline fares surged 6.5% monthly. Despite these mixed signals, markets remain divided on the likelihood of Fed rate cuts. Futures data suggest only two or at most three rate cuts are priced in, less than what some political figures like Trump advocate. The article concludes that while long-term Treasuries may rise in value, holding them carries significant risk. As a result, the prevailing market advice is to favor short- and medium-term Treasuries (up to three years) and to hedge exposure via U.S. dollar-denominated accounts, as these low-duration bonds currently offer a 3.5% yield\u2014deemed substantial amid ongoing uncertainty.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 01:29 PM\nSource:[Money.it](https://www.money.it/bond-oggi-treasuries-usa-e-il-momento-di-vendere-o-di-comprare)\n\n**Indian bonds rise on U.S. Treasury rally, ample cash**\nIndian government bonds rose on February 16, 2026, driven by a rally in U.S. Treasuries and abundant domestic liquidity, though concerns over bond supply limited gains. The benchmark 6.48% 2035 bond yield fell to 6.6642%, down from 6.6799% the previous Friday. Longer-duration bonds saw the largest yield declines: the 15-year yield dropped by approximately 4 basis points to 7.068%, and the 40-year bond yield fell 4.5 bps to 7.4520%. Despite a 100-basis-point interest rate cut by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in fiscal year 2025-26, yields on 15- to 40-year bonds have risen 40\u201350 basis points due to weak demand from insurers and pension funds and rising supply concerns. Traders noted that current yield levels are attractive for re-entry, especially after a debt switch operation by New Delhi reduced near-term supply and surplus liquidity returned, with average daily system liquidity at 2.62 trillion rupees in February, compared to 660 billion rupees in January. Alok Singh, head of treasury at CSB Bank, stated, 'RBI liquidity support is necessary for yields to sustain at lower levels,' adding, 'If liquidity stays in surplus, supply won't be a challenge.' Indian overnight index swap (OIS) rates also declined, tracking U.S. Treasury movements: the one-year OIS rate fell 1.25 bps to 5.49%, the two-year rate dropped 2.25 bps to 5.5950%, and the five-year rate declined 4 bps to 6.0250%. U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell about 15 bps to multi-month lows near 4.05% on Friday, following a U.S. retail inflation report showing a 0.2% rise in January, down from 0.3% in December.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 12:40 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/indian-bonds-rise-on-u-s-treasury-rally-ample-cash/articleshow/128422996.cms)\n\n**U.S. Treasury Yields Near 4.05%: Why No One Is Buying Yet?**\nOn February 16, 2026, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields fell to 4.051%, nearing the 240-minute Bollinger Band lower band at 4.046%, indicating a technically oversold condition but lacking clear stabilization signals. The yield decline since February 5 has been driven by holiday effects and a rebound in the U.S. dollar, which rose to 96.9589, retesting the 240-minute Bollinger Band middle band. The dollar's strength increases the currency cost for non-U.S. investors holding U.S. bonds, suppressing cross-border demand, especially with Asian investors absent due to the Lunar New Year holiday. Meanwhile, Federal Reserve officials signaled potential rate cuts, but highlighted persistent service sector inflation, leaving the March 18 meeting path uncertain. The market has largely priced in a hold, but further yield declines require stronger dovish signals. Technically, the 10-year yield remains below the 50-day moving average (4.184%) and MACD shows slight negative momentum contraction, suggesting limited upside for now. In contrast, gold has stabilized around $5,024.67, with MACD showing reduced negative momentum, and analysts have revised their medium-term target to $5,100\u2013$5,200. A key insight is the negative convenience yield of U.S. Treasuries relative to German bonds over the past 15 years, indicating market perception of higher risk in holding U.S. debt. This reflects growing concerns about U.S. fiscal risk, including potential impacts from illegal tariff legislation that could reduce annual revenue by $100\u2013$130 billion, further pressuring an already elevated fiscal deficit (5.8%\u20136.0%). With Asian markets still closed and U.S. markets resuming trading, yields are expected to oscillate between 4.046% and 4.136% in the near term. Key watchpoints include whether the dollar can sustain above 96.86 and test 97.10, and whether U.S. equity market strength draws capital from bonds. Despite underpricing of fiscal risk, short-term dynamics remain dominated by technical rebound attempts and low liquidity, with no trend reversal likely without a new catalyst.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 11:14 AM\nSource:[\u548c\u8baf\u5916\u6c47](http://forex.hexun.com/2026-02-16/223498984.html)\n\n**US 10-year Treasury yield eases as inflation softens | Investing.com ZA**\nUS headline inflation eased to 2.40% in January 2026, the lowest level since May 2025 and below the 2.50% forecast, leading the 10-year Treasury yield to decline to 4.07%. Economists attributed much of the slowdown to base effects from last year\u2019s elevated readings. Markets now price in two additional interest rate cuts later in 2026. Equity futures recovered from early losses, but major indices closed mostly flat: the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were steady, while the Dow Jones lost 100 points, ending a 1.50% weekly decline amid ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) market volatility. Megacap tech and semiconductor stocks were pressured, with Nvidia down 2.20%, Apple 2.30%, Alphabet 1.10%, Meta 1.60%, and Broadcom 1.80%, while Oracle, Palantir, Microsoft, and Micron remained flat. In contrast, Salesforce rose 2.30%, and Applied Materials and Arista Networks surged 10% each on strong earnings, defying broader tech weakness. In energy, the US eased sanctions on Venezuela\u2019s oil and gas sector via two general licenses, enabling international firms to operate and attract new capital\u2014a significant shift since the removal of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro last month. Silver rose nearly 4% to $77.50 an ounce, recovering from Thursday\u2019s losses, while gold advanced toward $5,020 an ounce, reducing weekly losses. European shares dipped slightly: the STOXX 50 fell 0.40% to 5,987, and the STOXX 600 declined 0.10% to 617, marking two consecutive days of modest declines after a record high. Banks including UniCredit, Deutsche Bank, and BBVA dropped 3.50% to 4%, L'Or\u00e9al fell 5% on weak year-end sales despite earnings, and Herm\u00e8s dipped slightly despite beating profit forecasts; Safran surged 8.30% after raising its full-year outlook. Eurozone employment rose 0.30%, supporting expectations of stable European Central Bank (ECB) rates. In the UK, the FTSE 100 gained 0.30% after a 0.70% drop on Thursday, lifted by rebounds in AI-exposed and defence stocks\u2014RELX jumped 9%, and London Stock Exchange Group rose over 0.50%. Germany\u2019s DAX 40 rose 0.30%, ending a three-day decline on strength in defence, aerospace, and tech stocks. Asian markets closed mixed: Hong Kong\u2019s Hang Seng Index fell 0.90% to 27,032.54 amid pre-Lunar New Year light trading, with Lenovo down 4.60% and NetEase losing 4.10%; Alibaba Group edged 0.90% lower despite increasing its AI focus. Japan\u2019s Nikkei 225 ended nearly unchanged at 57,639.84 after briefly surpassing 58,000. China\u2019s Shanghai Composite rose 0.10% to 4,134.02. Locally, the South African rand weakened on Friday due to lower global commodity prices and stronger-than-expected US labor data, though early support emerged from precious metals. CNBC Africa noted that a sustained rebound in commodity prices could limit further rand depreciation. In political developments, President Cyril Ramaphosa announced plans to deploy the military to combat organized crime and to pursue legal action against municipal officials failing to deliver water services\u2014this favorable policy response boosted investor confidence in the rand.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:45 AM\nSource:[Investing.com South Africa](https://za.investing.com/analysis/us-10year-treasury-yield-eases-as-inflation-softens-200617362)\n\n**India bonds steady as supply overhang caps Treasury-driven gains**\nIndian government bonds traded in a narrow range on February 16, 2026, as lower U.S. Treasury yields provided support, but concerns over upcoming domestic debt supply limited gains. The 10-year benchmark 6.48% 2035 bond yield held steady at 6.6750% as of 10:55 a.m. IST, compared to 6.6799% on Friday, reflecting inverse movement between bond yields and prices. The 10-year U.S. Treasury yield dropped to a multi-month low of 4.05% on Friday, driven by a 0.2% January U.S. Consumer Price Index rise, below December\u2019s 0.3%. Traders noted that while lower U.S. yields are positive, heavy domestic debt supply through March is expected to prevent a significant decline in Indian yields. The domestic 10-year yield eased about 6 basis points during the week, less than the 15 bps drop in U.S. yields, supported by a softer domestic inflation print and New Delhi\u2019s bond switch. Market participants emphasized that additional support, such as buybacks, is needed to significantly reduce yields. Meanwhile, banking system liquidity surged, with the February average surplus at 2.62 trillion rupees, up from 660 billion rupees in January, which may help balance demand and supply, especially at shorter maturities. After the January-March quarter, liquidity is expected to ease, enhancing rate cut transmission in the money market. India\u2019s overnight index swap (OIS) rates also declined: one-year OIS fell 1.75 bps to 5.4850%, two-year OIS dropped 3.25 bps to 5.5850%, and five-year OIS eased 3 bps to 6.0350%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:14 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/india-bonds-steady-as-supply-overhang-caps-treasury-driven-gains/articleshow/128408765.cms)\n\n**China Experts Forecast Weak Dollar to Boost Asian and Emerging Market Bonds Amid Global Policy Divergence and Geopolitical Risks**\nAccording to Chinese financial experts, a persistently weak U.S. dollar is expected to continue benefiting Asian and emerging market bonds, despite heightened risks from geopolitical tensions and divergent global monetary policies. The article highlights that U.S. Treasury yields have declined recently, with the 10-year yield falling to a two-month low of 4.05%, while the U.S. dollar index dipped to 96.91. This shift is attributed to several factors: concerns over Federal Reserve independence, political interference under a potential Trump administration, and European pension funds reducing U.S. Treasury holdings due to geopolitical disputes, such as the U.S. pursuit of Greenland. Additionally, Chinese regulators have reportedly instructed domestic banks to cap their U.S. Treasury holdings to manage risk, particularly amid fears that Kevin Warsh, a hawkish nominee for Fed Chair, could drive yields higher. Despite the U.S. economy showing strong job growth in January\u2014130,000 new jobs versus an expected 65,000\u2014market expectations for rate cuts remain intact, with analysts forecasting two cuts in 2026 and possibly three. The 2-year Treasury yield dropped to 3.408%, its lowest in four months. Meanwhile, emerging market U.S.-dollar high-yield bonds delivered a 13.9% return in 2025, outperforming U.S. government bonds, which returned only 0.2%. Experts like Zhang Haoen of CITIC Bank (International) and Ding Meng, chief economist at the same institution, emphasize that diversified bond portfolios\u2014spanning investment-grade, floating-rate, inflation-protected, and short-duration bonds\u2014are essential to mitigate concentration risk. They caution that single-market exposure increases vulnerability to shocks, especially with rising long-term yields in Japan due to fiscal concerns, though recent reassurances from Japanese Prime Minister Hatoyama have stabilized markets. Over the past six months, 32 new bond funds have been approved in Hong Kong, reflecting strong market activity ahead of the anticipated rate-cut cycle. Conversely, three bond funds have been delisted, including the Allianz Emerging Markets SR1 Bond Fund and others. The overarching advice remains: maintain diversified exposure across regions and asset classes to enhance long-term returns and resilience.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 09:39 AM\nSource:[\u9999\u6e2f\u7d93\u6fdf\u65e5\u5831HKET](https://inews.hket.com/article/4085003/%E5%82%B5%E5%88%B8%E8%B5%B0%E5%8B%A2%EF%BD%9C%E4%B8%AD%E8%B3%87%E5%B0%88%E5%AE%B6%E6%96%99%E5%BC%B1%E7%BE%8E%E5%85%83%E7%BA%8C%E5%88%A9%E5%A5%BD%E4%BA%9E%E5%82%B5-%E6%96%B0%E8%88%88%E5%B8%82%E5%A0%B4%E5%82%B5%20%E6%83%9F%E5%A0%85%E5%AE%88%E5%A4%9A%E5%85%83%E5%B8%83%E5%B1%80)\n\n**Treasury Yield Trend Revived by Consumer Confidence Slump | Stock Market News**\nA rally in short-maturity U.S. Treasuries, driven by a sharp decline in January's Conference Board consumer sentiment index to its lowest level in over a decade, revived the yield-curve steepening trend from 2025 that had stalled in early 2026. The drop in consumer confidence strengthened expectations of two Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts in 2026, prompting short-term Treasury yields to fall\u2014most notably, the two-year note yield dropped more than three basis points from its daily high. For much of 2025, short-term yields declined due to anticipation of Fed rate cuts, while longer-term yields remained elevated due to inflation concerns and higher borrowing costs, resulting in record-wide yield differentials between two- and 10-year notes and between five- and 30-year notes. However, in early 2026, short-term yields rose amid signs of labor market strength, including a declining unemployment rate, narrowing yield spreads. Despite weak demand for the five-year note auction on Tuesday, the 30-year yield rose, widening the five- to 30-year spread by nearly four basis points\u2014the largest one-day increase in 2026. At the first of eight Federal Reserve meetings in 2026, policymakers are expected to hold rates steady. Yet, interest rate swap contracts fully price in a rate cut by July and an additional cut by year-end.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 08:56 PM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/market/treasury-yield-trend-revived-by-consumer-confidence-slump-11769547402880.html)\n\n**US bond market faces a more challenging road ahead in 2026**\nUS bond investors are expected to face a more challenging environment in 2026 after a stellar performance in 2025, driven by a 75 basis point cumulative Federal Reserve rate cut, a resilient economy, and strong corporate earnings. These factors boosted bond prices and kept credit risks low, resulting in broad bond indices posting over 7% total returns in 2025 \u2014 the best performance since 2020. The Morningstar US Core Bond Total Return Index gained more than 7%, while investment-grade bonds delivered nearly 8% returns, supported by credit spreads near multi-decade lows (around 80 basis points). However, expectations for 2026 are more muted: traders are pricing in only about 60 basis points of rate cuts, slower than in 2025. Fiscal stimulus measures, including potential tax and spending initiatives, could support growth and keep longer-term yields elevated. Benchmark 10-year Treasury yields fell by over 40 basis points in 2025 to around 4.1%, but major banks forecast they will end 2026 at or slightly above current levels. A divergence may emerge, with shorter-maturity yields declining further while longer-term yields could rise due to stronger growth or higher government debt, pressuring long-duration bond returns. Asset managers are becoming cautious on duration, favoring shorter-dated securities. Credit spreads may widen in 2026 due to increased corporate borrowing, especially from large tech firms, potentially reducing returns for investment-grade and high-yield bonds. While some analysts expect a stronger bond rally if inflation eases and growth slows, requiring aggressive Fed cuts, the overall outlook points to steadier, harder-earned returns compared to the exceptional gains of 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 31, 2025 05:06 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/us-stocks/news/us-bond-market-faces-a-more-challenging-road-ahead-in-2026/articleshow/126264115.cms)\n\n**Treasury Yields Hold Steady As Wall Street Braces For 'Considerably Slower' Q4 GDP**\nU.S. Treasury yields remained relatively stable on Friday, December 26, 2025, with the 10-year yield falling one basis point to 4.132%, the 30-year yield rising one basis point to 4.801%, and the 2-year yield declining two basis points to 3.493%. Analysts at ING Think anticipate 'considerably slower' fourth-quarter GDP growth, citing the 43-day U.S. government shutdown and a projected slowdown in consumer spending. Despite expectations of muted growth, long-term yields did not collapse due to persistent macroeconomic caution, term-premium pressures, and structural market forces. Gregory Faranello of AmeriVet Securities noted that sustained inflation and growth make a significant drop in 10-year yields unlikely. Jeremy Siegel, professor emeritus at Wharton, expects further Federal Reserve rate cuts, potentially bringing rates to the low-3% range, but does not foresee a collapse in long-term yields, which he expects to remain anchored in the low-4% range due to term premium, issuance, and structural factors. Nuveen analysts believe Treasury entry points will become increasingly attractive, with duration likely to regain its role as a growth hedge, despite risks from tariffs impacting consumer spending and business investment. The iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (TLT) rose 0.15%, and the iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF (IEF) gained 0.16%, with retail sentiment on TLT in 'bullish' territory.

While AI stocks surged and gold rose nearly 70%, the 30-year U.S. bond saw its yield remain stable at around 4.8%\u2014unchanged from\u5e74\u521d\u2014outperforming comparable long-term bonds in Germany and Japan, which saw yields rise by over 100 basis points. Despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s 75 basis point rate cuts, persistent high inflation limited downward pressure on long-term yields. The bond\u2019s resilience is attributed to structural demand from retirement funds, insurance companies, and mutual funds seeking near-5% risk-free returns for asset-liability matching. The U.S. Treasury successfully conducted 12 auctions totaling $276 billion, with an average bid-to-cover ratio of 2.37\u2014consistent with the past four years. Auction data revealed investors still demanded a term premium, and foreign holdings rebounded in the second half, reaching 15% in November\u2014the highest since early 2024. However, the sustainability of this 'dancing on the edge' equilibrium remains uncertain due to ongoing inflation risks, debt supply pressures, policy credibility concerns, and the uncertain impact of AI-driven productivity. The 30-year U.S. Treasury\u2019s stability in 2025 may itself be the most unrepeatable miracle.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 24, 2025 09:10 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The 30-year U.S. Treasury bond**\nThe 30-year U.S. Treasury bond is being hailed as the financial asset of 2025, despite not experiencing price gains this year. While it has not matched the returns of AI stocks or gold, it has remained stable, with its yield around 4.8%\u2014essentially unchanged from the start of the year\u2014despite significant macroeconomic headwinds. These include persistently high inflation, a 10% decline in the U.S. dollar, a rise in the U.S. 'term premium' to its highest level in over a decade, attacks on Federal Reserve independence by the Trump administration, and the upcoming 'One Big Beautiful Bill' that could add trillions to the budget deficit. Despite these pressures, the bond's yield has not risen significantly. The 10-year yield has fallen nearly 50 basis points due to Fed rate cuts, but longer-dated yields have been constrained by inflation above target. The 2s/30s yield curve has steepened to its steepest level in four years, though this is driven by front-end movements. Internationally, Germany\u2019s 30-year bund yield rose nearly 100 bps and Japan\u2019s 30-year bond yield reached an all-time high. The U.S. bond\u2019s resilience is attributed to strong demand from 'real money' investors\u2014pension funds, mutual funds, and insurance companies\u2014seeking long-duration assets to match liabilities. Treasury\u2019s 12 auctions in 2025 were successful, with an average bid-to-cover ratio of 2.37, close to the 50-auction average of 2.38 since November 2021. Domestic institutional investors held 70\u201375% of the bonds, and foreign demand increased in the second half of the year, reaching over 15% in November\u2014the highest since early 2024. Investors generally paid higher yields than pre-sale market levels, indicating strong demand. However, challenges for 2026 are expected to be more severe, with rising risk premia, inflation risks, higher debt supply, doubts about AI productivity, and continued threats to Fed independence, all of which could test the bond\u2019s resilience.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 22, 2025 02:19 PM\nSource:[The Globe and Mail](https://www.theglobeandmail.com/investing/article-surprise-asset-of-the-year-the-30-year-us-treasury-bond/)\n\n**U.S. Treasury\u2019s Safe-Haven Glow Reawakened by Credit Storm: '4% Zone' in Focus**\nThe U.S. Treasury market has shown renewed strength amid renewed risk-off sentiment, with benchmark yields falling to multi-month lows. The 2-year Treasury yield dropped below 3.4%\u2014the lowest since 2022\u2014while the 10-year yield saw its largest weekly decline in four months, briefly falling below 4% before rebounding above it by Friday. This followed a prior surge in bond demand triggered by escalating trade tensions earlier in the month. The recent rally was driven by investor panic over regional banking credit risks and a government shutdown that delayed key economic data, including September CPI. Market participants, including JPMorgan Asset Management\u2019s Priya Misra, view U.S. Treasuries as an ideal hedge, with her firm holding 5- to 10-year notes to gain confidence in credit investments. With weakening labor market signals, traders now expect a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Fed by month-end. Despite high equity and credit valuations, 10-year yields near 4% are seen as a safe haven. Even 30-year bonds rose, partially offsetting concerns over global 'currency depreciation trades,' though massive borrowing needs continue to support gold prices above $4,000 per ounce. The recent bond surge recalls the 2023 Silicon Valley Bank crisis, when 2-year yields dropped over 100 basis points. Traders are now closely watching the 4% threshold on the 10-year yield, with the yield briefly hitting 3.93%\u2014its lowest since April 7\u2014before rebounding. Options markets indicate bets on further declines below 4%, which could trigger additional hedging and amplify gains. The Bloomberg U.S. Treasury Index has risen 6.6% year-to-date, potentially making 2025 the best year for bonds since 2020. Morgan Stanley\u2019s Matthew Hornbach argues that 10-year yields above 4% are nearing their end, citing prolonged government shutdown risks. However, upcoming economic data, particularly the delayed September CPI (now due October 24), may temporarily halt further declines. Economists expect core CPI to remain at 0.3% monthly, keeping year-over-year inflation at 3.1%, well above the Fed\u2019s 2% target. AmeriVet Securities\u2019 Gregory Faranello stated that while the 10-year yield has room to fall below 4%, conditions would need to deteriorate significantly.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: October 20, 2025 01:05 AM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202510203538152026.html)\n\n**Personal Finance: Safe Investments During Crises | Low Risk | The Epoch Times**\nThe article, published on October 11, 2025, by The Epoch Times, discusses safe investment options during economic crises. It highlights several low-risk investment vehicles: U.S. Treasury Bonds (T-bonds), which are long-term government securities (20\u201330 years) with semi-annual interest payments and federal tax on interest, but exempt from state and local taxes; Treasury Notes (T-notes), with maturities of 2, 3, 5, 7, or 10 years, also paying interest semi-annually and taxed similarly; Treasury Bills (T-bills), short-term loans (one year or less) purchased at a discount, with profit derived from the difference between purchase price and face value; and Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS), whose principal adjusts with inflation (measured by CPI), providing protection against rising prices, with maturities of 5, 10, or 30 years. The article also recommends defensive stocks and funds in sectors like consumer staples, utilities, and healthcare, which provide essential goods and services regardless of economic conditions, as well as dividend-paying stocks and funds for stable income. Cash equivalents such as high-yield savings accounts, money market accounts (insured up to $250,000), and certificates of deposit (CDs) with fixed rates and federal insurance are advised, though early withdrawal from CDs incurs penalties. The article concludes that, despite economic downturns, multiple secure investment avenues exist, including government securities, defensive equities, and insured cash accounts.

Despite the ongoing U.S. government shutdown since October 1, 2024, long-term yields have shown surprising resilience. Typically considered safe-haven assets, Treasuries are seeing upward pressure due to market concerns over the shutdown. Investors are also awaiting the Federal Reserve\u2019s meeting minutes later in the week for clues on the pace of potential interest rate cuts. Technically, the 30-year yield is testing resistance levels at 4.77% (1-week high) and 4.792% (1-year high), with an RSI of 44.59 indicating no overbought condition. The breakout above the double-top neckline at 4.712% signals further upside potential. A critical test comes on Thursday when the U.S. Department of the Treasury auctions $22 billion in bonds, which will gauge market demand. Meanwhile, equity markets show mixed signals: the S&P 500 and Nasdaq rose 0.3% and 0.6%, respectively, while the Dow Jones fell 0.2%. The U.S. Dollar Index gained 0.4% to 98.13. Notably, both gold and oil rose\u2014gold up 1.7% to a record high of approximately $3,980 and oil up 1.5% to $61.75\u2014suggesting investors are simultaneously seeking safety and hedging against inflation.
