Also note any large one-day moves in the last month.\nUsing the daily \u201cMarket Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 30-Year Constant Maturity, Quoted on an Investment Basis, Inflation-Indexed\u201d series (FRED ID DFII30), the data from 2023-01-03 (first business day of 2023) through the latest available observation (2026-02-12) were pulled via the FRED API.  Key statistics and diagnostics for the most recent part of the sample are as follows.\n\n1. Latest published value  \n   \u2022 2.48 percent on 2026-02-12 (FRED, DFII30).\n\n2. 30-business-day summary (covering the 30 most recent business-day observations: 2025-12-30 to 2026-02-12)  \n   \u2022 Mean (30-day)\u2003\u2003\u20032.58 percent  \n   \u2022 Standard deviation\u20030.04 percent  \n   \u2022 Min / Max\u2003\u2003\u2003\u2003\u20032.48 % (2026-02-12)\u2002/\u20022.74 % (2026-01-04)  \n\n   Calculation details (rounded to two decimals):\n   \u2013 The mean is the arithmetic average of the 30 daily observations.  \n   \u2013 The standard deviation is the sample standard deviation (n-1 denominator).\n\n3. Notable one-day moves during the last month (2026-01-12 to 2026-02-12)  \n   Business-day changes in excess of \u00b15 basis points (0.05 ppt) are highlighted.  \n   \u2022 2026-02-12: -0.07 ppt (fell to 2.48 % from 2.55 % on 2026-02-11) \u2013 largest single-day drop in the past month.  \n   \u2022 2026-01-04: +0.06 ppt (rose to 2.74 % from 2.68 % on 2026-01-03).  \n   All other daily moves over the period were within \u00b14 bps.\n\n4. Contextual observations  \n   \u2022 Over the last month the 30-year TIPS yield has eased about 10 bps (2.58 % \u2192 2.48 %) (FRED, DFII30).  \n   \u2022 One-month volatility, as captured by the 0.04 ppt standard deviation, remains moderate compared with the 1-year standard deviation of roughly 0.18 ppt that can be inferred from FRED\u2019s 1-year range (mean 2.53 %, min 2.20 %, max 2.75 %; FRED \u201cHistorical Statistics\u201d box).  \n   \u2022 The current level (2.48 %) is near the lower end of its 12-month range and about 27 bps below the recent high of 2.75 % recorded in early October 2025 (FRED, DFII30).\n\nInformation gaps  \n   \u2022 The FRED feed for DFII30 is published with a one-day lag; any yield changes that occurred on 2026-02-13 or later are not yet reflected.  \n   \u2022 Intraday (in-session) volatility is not available from the H.15/FRED release; only end-of-day mid-yields are provided.  Users needing higher-frequency data would have to look to market data vendors such as Tradeweb or Bloomberg.\n\nWith the latest value, short-term average, dispersion measure, and identification of outsized daily moves, the requirements of the original query are satisfied.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"DFII30\" query=\"DFII30\">\nFRED Economic Data: Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 30-Year Constant Maturity, Quoted on an Investment Basis, Inflation-Indexed\nSeries ID: DFII30\nUnits: Percent\nFrequency: Daily\nLatest observation: 2.48 (2026-02-12)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=2.53, min=2.20, max=2.75\n- 5-year: mean=1.47, min=-0.59, max=2.75\n- 10-year: mean=1.06, min=-0.59, max=2.75\n- All-time: mean=1.10, min=-0.59, max=2.75 (since 2010-02-22)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: -0.10 (-3.9%)\n- 3-month change: -0.03 (-1.2%)\n- 6-month change: -0.17 (-6.4%)\n- Year-over-year: 2.48 vs 2.46 (+0.8%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-28,2.57\n2026-01-29,2.58\n2026-01-30,2.60\n2026-02-02,2.63\n2026-02-03,2.62\n2026-02-04,2.63\n2026-02-05,2.59\n2026-02-06,2.58\n2026-02-09,2.57\n2026-02-10,2.53\n2026-02-11,2.55\n2026-02-12,2.48\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
