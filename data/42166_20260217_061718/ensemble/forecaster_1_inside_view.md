**AskNews Articles Summary:**
- Multiple sources (Feb 15-17, 2026) confirm Danish PM's statement that Trump's desire "remains unchanged" and he's "very serious"
- Greenland PM Nielsen and Danish PM Frederiksen both emphasize sovereignty is "non-negotiable"
- Tripartite working group established (US-Denmark-Greenland)
- Trump ruled out military force at Davos (Jan 21)
- NATO launching Arctic Sentry mission
- Kalshi prediction market shows 20% probability, $7.9M wagered
- All Greenlandic political parties united in rejecting US acquisition (Jan 10, 2026)

**Key factual consensus across sources:** Trump remains serious about Greenland, but has ruled out military force. Talks are ongoing through working group. All Greenlandic parties oppose acquisition. Denmark maintains sovereignty is non-negotiable.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (large shifts):**
- **Structural barrier:** All five Greenlandic political parties unanimously oppose US acquisition (Jan 10, 2026). This represents complete political consensus against the resolution criteria.
- **Official de-escalation:** Trump explicitly ruled out military force at Davos (Jan 21, 2026) - direct quote from primary source
- **Time constraint:** Only 10.5 months remain in 2026 for formal sovereignty transfer requiring statute or binding agreement

**Moderate Evidence (moderate shifts):**
- **Recent diplomatic tone (Feb 17, 2026):** Despite Trump being "very serious," working group established suggests diplomatic rather than confrontational approach
- **NATO response:** Arctic Sentry exercise with 20,000 troops shows European military coordination, raising costs of unilateral US action
- **Market signals:** Kalshi at 20% (higher than Metaculus 6%) suggests some traders see higher probability, but still low overall

**Weak Evidence (small adjustments):**
- **Trump unpredictability:** History shows Trump can reverse positions, but he's been consistent on ruling out force since Jan 21
- **COFA speculation:** Opinion pieces suggest alternatives, but no evidence of serious negotiations on this model

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 11 days (Feb 17 to Feb 28, 2026)

**Current state:** CP at exactly 6.00% as of Feb 16. Question asks if it will be >6.00% on Feb 28.

**If timeframe halved (5-6 days):** Would predict even lower probability of movement above 6.00%, as less time for new catalysts. Perhaps 20-25%.

**If timeframe doubled (22 days):** Would increase probability slightly to ~40-45%, as more time allows for potential Trump statements, congressional developments, or diplomatic breakthroughs/breakdowns.

**Key temporal factor:** The Feb 17 article (TODAY) represents the most recent major news cycle. The Munich Security Conference statements are now public and absorbed. Next major catalyst would need to be: (1) new Trump statement, (2) congressional action, (3) working group announcement, or (4) diplomatic crisis.

## (d) Justification

**Factors suggesting CP will NOT rise above 6.00%:**

1. **De-escalatory trajectory:** Since Jan 21 Davos speech, Trump has consistently ruled out force. The Feb 17 Munich statements, while confirming Trump is "serious," also emphasize "constructive talks" and working group process.

2. **Absorbed information:** The Metaculus community has had from Jan 7 (military option announced) through Feb 16 to process all developments. The 6.00% already incorporates: Trump's seriousness, military option ruled out, ongoing talks, universal Greenlandic opposition, Danish red lines.

3. **No imminent deadline:** With 10.5 months left in 2026 and talks described as "constructive," there's no pressure for rapid developments that would spike the forecast.

4. **Structural barriers well-known:** The unanimous Greenlandic opposition (all 5 parties) and Danish sovereignty stance are public and stable factors.

**Factors suggesting CP MIGHT rise above 6.00%:**

1. **Trump could make new provocative statement:** His "very serious" characterization per Feb 17 article suggests continued focus
2. **Working group could announce progress:** Though unlikely to be sovereignty-related, any announcement could be misinterpreted
3. **Congressional action:** Bills pending could generate headlines

**Critical assessment:** The Feb 17 article is crucial - it's the most recent data point and shows the situation is stable (serious but diplomatic). The Kalshi market at 20% is notably higher than Metaculus 6%, but Kalshi markets can be less sophisticated than Metaculus communities. The Metaculus 6% appears well-calibrated given:
- Universal Greenlandic opposition
- Danish red lines
- Trump ruling out force
- No evidence of breakthrough in talks
- 10.5 months remaining (no urgency)

**Shift from outside view:** My outside view was 32%. After analyzing current sources, I'm adjusting DOWNWARD to ~25-28% because:
- The Feb 17 Munich conference showed continued de-escalation, not escalation
- The working group establishment suggests institutionalized diplomatic process (slower-moving)
- No new catalysts are apparent in the 11-day window
- The Metaculus community likely already incorporated the "Trump is serious" signal

The most likely scenario is the CP remains at or near 6.00%, possibly drifting slightly lower if no new developments emerge.

## Probability Calibration

**Base rate from outside view:** 32%

**Adjustments based on current information:**

**Downward adjustments (-7 to -10 percentage points):**
- Feb 17 Munich statements show stable diplomatic situation, not escalation
- Working group process suggests slow, institutionalized approach
- No apparent catalysts in next 11 days
- Community has had 6+ weeks to absorb Trump's seriousness

**Upward adjustments (+0 to +3 percentage points):**
- Trump unpredictability factor
- Kalshi market at 20% suggests some see higher probability
- Possible working group announcement

**Net adjustment:** -5 to -7 percentage points

**Calibrated prediction:** 25-27%

**Final consideration:** The question asks for probability >6.00%, meaning even 6.01% counts as "Yes." This is a very low bar. However, it also means 6.00% exactly or any decrease counts as "No." Given the recent de-escalatory signals and lack of apparent catalysts, I assess ~25% probability the CP rises above 6.00% in the next 11 days.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Metaculus community prediction for "US gains Greenland sovereignty in 2026" exceed 6.00% on Feb 28? Currently at 6.00% as of Feb 16.

2. **Outside view base rate:** 32% → Adjusted to 25% based on Feb 17 de-escalatory signals and lack of near-term catalysts.

3. **Consistency check:** "25 out of 100 times, the Metaculus CP rises above 6.00% by Feb 28." This aligns with low probability of new catalysts in 11 days while acknowledging Trump unpredictability.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence:**
   - Feb 17: Danish PM confirms Trump "very serious" but talks "constructive" with working group (factual, high quality)
   - Jan 21: Trump explicitly ruled out military force at Davos (factual, primary source)
   - Jan 10: All five Greenlandic parties unanimously reject US acquisition (factual, structural barrier)
   - Feb 17: NATO launching Arctic Sentry with 20,000 troops (factual, raises costs of unilateral action)

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Trump makes sudden provocative statement or working group announces unexpected "framework agreement" that media interprets as progress toward sovereignty transfer, causing CP to spike to 8-10%. This would make my forecast look overly conservative. Probability of this scenario: ~15-20%.

6. **Status quo outcome:** Status quo is CP staying at 6.00% or declining slightly. Given stable diplomatic situation, lack of imminent deadlines, and recent de-escalatory signals, status quo is most likely. The 11-day timeframe is short, reducing volatility. Slight nudge toward status quo (CP ≤6.00%) is warranted.

**Final adjustment:** Given status quo bias and short timeframe, adjusting final prediction to 24%.

Probability: 24%
