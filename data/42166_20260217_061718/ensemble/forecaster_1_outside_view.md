Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Guardian (Jan 6, 2026):** High-quality mainstream source reporting White House press secretary's statement that military force is "always an option" for acquiring Greenland. Key factual elements: official White House position, European/Danish responses, poll showing only 7% of Americans support military seizure. Date is ~6 weeks before the target date.

**Manifold Markets:** Prediction market data (not news). Shows related questions with probabilities: US acquiring Greenland by March 31, 2026 at 5%, by end of Trump term at 6%, by Dec 31 2026 at 7%. These are crowd-sourced betting positions, not expert analysis, but useful as reference points.

**Sunday Guardian (Jan 31, 2026):** Opinion piece arguing Trump's Greenland ambitions are strategically outdated. This is explicitly opinion/analysis rather than factual reporting, though it provides context on legal and geopolitical constraints.

**Al Jazeera (Jan 22, 2026):** Reports on Trump's claims of securing "total access" framework with NATO, but crucially notes Greenland PM Nielsen stated sovereignty is a "red line" and that he doesn't know what's in any agreement. Trump dropped threat of tariffs and ruled out use of force. Factual reporting from reputable source.

**MyIndMakers:** Provides historical context and current situation overview. Mixed factual reporting with opinion. Notes ongoing talks but states "full annexation remains out of reach under existing international law."

**USA Today (Feb 14, 2026):** Most recent source (3 days old). Reports from Munich Security Conference that Danish PM Frederiksen and Greenlandic PM Nielsen say Trump is "very serious" but also that "constructive talks" are occurring. Critically notes: "Virtually no details about the discussions have been made public." This is high-quality factual reporting from a major outlet.

**Agent Report:** Confirms no daily community prediction data is available. Provides comprehensive timeline of events from Jan 7-Feb 14, 2026, identifying potential catalysts for forecast movements. The report is factual in documenting events but cannot provide the crucial numerical forecast history.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Metaculus community prediction movements on geopolitical questions over 12-day periods:** Most directly relevant. The question asks whether the CP will move from 6.00% to >6.00% in 12 days (Feb 16 to Feb 28).

2. **Historical U.S. territorial acquisitions in modern era:** Extremely rare. Last major acquisition was 1947 (UN Trust Territory). Not particularly relevant since we're forecasting community prediction movement, not actual acquisition.

3. **Metaculus forecast stability on low-probability events with ongoing news:** When a question sits at ~5-7% and has active news coverage, how often does it move significantly in a short timeframe?

4. **Trump administration follow-through on territorial/sovereignty claims:** Relevant for understanding whether new developments might emerge that would move the forecast.

**Most suitable reference class:** #1 and #3 combined - examining how Metaculus community predictions on geopolitical questions respond to news flow when already at low single-digit probabilities.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 12 days (Feb 17 to Feb 28, 2026)

**Current state (as of Feb 16, 2026):**
- Community prediction is exactly at 6.00%
- Question opened Feb 17, 2026
- Must predict if CP will be >6.00% on Feb 28

**Historical pattern over recent weeks:**
- Jan 7: Military option announced → likely caused initial spike
- Jan 14: White House summit → potential movement
- Jan 19: Congressional bill filed → potential movement
- Feb 14: Munich conference statements → most recent catalyst

**Key observation:** The USA Today article (Feb 14) notes that despite Trump being "very serious," there are "constructive talks" occurring and "virtually no details" are public. This suggests a stabilization phase rather than escalation.

**Critical factor:** The question resolves early if the underlying Metaculus question resolves before Feb 28. Given the original question asks about formal sovereignty during 2026, and we're only in mid-February with talks described as "constructive," early resolution seems unlikely.

## (d) Justification

The question asks whether the Metaculus community prediction will rise above 6.00% in the next 12 days. Several factors suggest it will likely remain stable or decline slightly:

**Factors favoring stability/decline:**
1. **Recent news suggests de-escalation:** The Feb 14 Munich conference showed "constructive talks" and Trump dropped tariff threats and ruled out force (per Al Jazeera Jan 22)
2. **Strong opposition signals:** Denmark, Greenland, and NATO allies have drawn firm red lines on sovereignty
3. **Legal/practical barriers well-understood:** Multiple sources note international law constraints
4. **Time horizon:** 11 months remain in 2026; no immediate deadline pressure
5. **Current CP already incorporates recent news:** At 6.00%, the community has already priced in Trump's seriousness and ongoing talks

**Factors favoring increase:**
1. **Trump unpredictability:** Could make new provocative statements
2. **Congressional action:** Bills pending could generate news
3. **Diplomatic breakdown:** Talks could fail publicly

**Baseline from related markets:** Manifold shows 5-7% for various 2026 acquisition scenarios, suggesting the Metaculus 6% is well-calibrated to current information.

**Metaculus community behavior:** Communities on prediction platforms tend to be sticky at round numbers (5%, 10%) and slow to move without major new information. The Feb 14 news was significant but not escalatory.

Outside view calibration:

The question requires the CP to move from exactly 6.00% to >6.00% - meaning any movement above 6.00% counts as "Yes." However, this also means any movement to ≤6.00% (including staying at exactly 6.00%) counts as "No."

**Key calibration points:**

1. **Baseline stickiness:** Metaculus CPs on geopolitical questions with 10-14 day horizons typically don't move dramatically without major news. The Feb 14 Munich conference was the most recent significant event, and it suggested de-escalation rather than escalation.

2. **Tethering to available data:** Manifold markets show 5-7% range for related questions. The current 6% appears well-calibrated.

3. **Direction of likely movement:** Given the constructive talks and lack of new escalatory rhetoric since Feb 14, any movement is more likely downward than upward. The initial shock of Trump's statements has been absorbed.

4. **Probability of new catalysts:** In 12 days, there's perhaps a 20-30% chance of significant new developments (major Trump statement, congressional action, diplomatic breakdown) that would push the forecast higher. But there's also a 20-30% chance of further de-escalatory signals that would push it lower.

5. **Exact threshold effect:** The question asks if CP will be "higher than 6.00%" - this is a precise threshold. If the CP moves to 5.9% or stays at 6.0%, the answer is No. Only movement to 6.01% or higher yields Yes.

6. **Historical upset rate:** On Metaculus geopolitical questions, low-probability events (5-10% range) rarely see dramatic short-term movements without major catalysts. The community tends toward incremental updates.

Given the recent de-escalatory signals, the lack of imminent deadlines, the strong opposition from all parties, and the typical stickiness of Metaculus forecasts, I assess the probability of the CP rising above 6.00% in the next 12 days as relatively low - perhaps 30-35%.
