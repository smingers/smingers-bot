Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

**Primary sources (high credibility, factual):**
1. **Guardian (Jan 7, 2026)**: Direct quotes from White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt stating military force is "always an option." High credibility, primary source material.

2. **CNN/Aaron Blake (Jan 21, 2026)**: Trump's Davos speech explicitly ruling out military force. Direct quotes: "I won't use force," "The military's not on the table." High credibility, primary source.

3. **Danish PM statements (Feb 15-17, 2026)**: Multiple sources (Sentinel, Munich Security Conference) quote Mette Frederiksen stating Trump's desire is "exactly the same" and he's "very serious," but sovereignty is "non-negotiable." High credibility, consistent across sources.

4. **Greenlandic PM Nielsen (Feb 17, 2026)**: Statements at Munich describing Trump's threats as "outrageous," confirming working group exists. High credibility.

**Secondary/analytical sources:**
5. **Arctic Institute (Jan 8, 2026)**: Expert analysis by Andreas Østhagen questioning strategic rationale. Moderate credibility for expert opinion.

6. **Fair Observer (Feb 16, 2026)**: Academic analysis noting Operation Absolute Resolve in Venezuela. Moderate credibility for context.

7. **Prediction market reports (Feb 10, 2026)**: Kalshi showing 20% probability, $7.9M wagered. Factual market data, moderate relevance.

8. **Foreign Affairs fictional scenario (Jan 12, 2024)**: Explicitly labeled speculative fiction. Zero weight for forecasting.

**Key factual findings:**
- Trump ruled out military force on Jan 21, 2026
- Tripartite working group established (US-Denmark-Greenland)
- Denmark committed 6+ billion USD to Greenland defense
- NATO launched "Arctic Sentry" mission
- No concrete sovereignty transfer proposals have been made public
- Current Metaculus community prediction: 6.00% as of Feb 16, 2026

(b) Evidence analysis:

**Strong evidence for downward pressure:**
- Trump's explicit Jan 21 statement ruling out military force removes the most dramatic escalation path
- Danish PM's consistent "red lines" messaging and "non-negotiable" sovereignty stance
- Greenlandic rejection across all five political parties (Jan 10, 2026)
- Establishment of working group suggests shift to diplomatic track, not imminent sovereignty transfer
- 11.5 days is insufficient time for treaty negotiations, parliamentary ratification, or formal sovereignty transfer

**Moderate evidence for status quo/slight downward:**
- No major scheduled diplomatic events between now and Feb 28
- Market prediction (20% on Kalshi) suggests informed traders see low probability, though this is for full 2026
- Historical pattern: initial spike from Jan 6 "military option" statement, then stabilization after Jan 21 walkback

**Weak evidence for upward pressure:**
- Danish PM saying Trump's "desire" unchanged (but desire ≠ action)
- Working group existence (but working groups typically take months to produce results)
- Speculation about small military sites (unconfirmed rumors)

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Timeframe: 11.5 days** (Feb 17 to Feb 28, 2026)

This is a very short window. The resolution criteria asks whether the Metaculus community prediction will be >6.00% on Feb 28. 

**If timeframe were halved (5-6 days):** Would increase confidence in status quo outcome (~6%) as insufficient time for any news. Probability of >6% would drop to ~15%.

**If timeframe were doubled (23 days):** Would increase uncertainty and chance of news-driven spikes. Probability of >6% would rise to ~35-40% as more opportunity for diplomatic leaks, Trump statements, or geopolitical events.

The short 11.5-day window favors inertia. Major sovereignty negotiations require months. The most likely movements are:
- Small downward drift as no new escalatory news emerges (probability ~50%)
- Status quo at 6.00% (probability ~25%)
- Small upward bump from Trump tweet or minor diplomatic news (probability ~25%)

(d) Justification:

**Outside view base rate: 28%** (probability of upward movement >6%)

**Adjustments from inside view:**

**Downward adjustments (-8 to -10 pp):**
1. **Post-peak reversion**: The current 6% likely represents a reaction high from Jan 6-14 escalation followed by Jan 21 de-escalation. We're now 27 days past the Jan 21 walkback with no new major escalation. This suggests the forecast has found a new equilibrium.

2. **Short timeframe with no catalysts**: No major summits, treaty signings, or scheduled Trump speeches between now and Feb 28. The Munich Security Conference (Feb 15) already occurred without moving the needle above 6%.

3. **Structural barriers**: Even if Trump wanted rapid action, formal sovereignty transfer requires Congressional legislation, Danish parliamentary approval, and/or Greenlandic referendum. None of these can occur in 11.5 days.

**Upward adjustments (+3 to +5 pp):**
1. **Trump unpredictability**: Trump could issue inflammatory statements via Truth Social or interviews that spike the forecast temporarily.

2. **Working group news**: If leaks emerge about working group discussions, even without concrete sovereignty proposals, forecasters might bump predictions upward.

**Net adjustment: -5 pp from outside view**

The outside view suggested 28% based on generic reference class behavior. However, the specific context—post-escalation stabilization, short timeframe, structural barriers, and absence of scheduled catalysts—argues for a lower probability. The most likely outcome is that the community prediction stays at 6.00% or drifts slightly downward as the initial shock fades.

Probability calibration:

Starting from outside view: 28%

Adjustments:
- Post-peak stabilization effect: -5%
- Short timeframe with no major scheduled events: -3%
- Structural impossibility of actual sovereignty transfer in 11.5 days: -2%
- Trump unpredictability/tweet risk: +3%

**Calibrated inside view: 21%**

This represents roughly 1-in-5 odds that the Metaculus community prediction will tick above 6.00% by Feb 28. The most likely scenario (79%) is that it remains at 6.00% or drifts to 5.5-5.9% as the initial January escalation continues to fade without replacement by new dramatic news.

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Metaculus community prediction for "US gains Greenland sovereignty in 2026" exceed 6.00% on Feb 28, 2026? (Currently 6.00% as of Feb 16.)

2. **Base rate**: Outside view established 28% probability of upward movement based on reference class of similar Metaculus geopolitical questions. My final 21% is rooted to this base rate with modest downward adjustment justified by post-peak stabilization and short timeframe.

3. **Consistency**: "21 out of 100 times, the Metaculus community prediction exceeds 6.00% on Feb 28." This aligns with my view that most likely outcome is status quo or slight decline, with ~1-in-5 chance of upward bump from Trump statement or minor news.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Trump explicitly ruled out military force on Jan 21 (factual, high credibility)
   - Danish PM states sovereignty "non-negotiable" at Munich Feb 15 (factual, high credibility)
   - No major diplomatic events scheduled before Feb 28 (factual)
   - Current prediction already at 6.00%, suggesting equilibrium (factual, Metaculus data)
   - 11.5 days insufficient for formal sovereignty transfer process (structural fact)

5. **Blind spot**: Trump issues a dramatic statement (e.g., "Denmark has 48 hours to negotiate or face consequences") that spikes the forecast to 8-10% despite no actual policy change. This could occur via social media and would make my forecast look too conservative. Would shift probability to ~35%.

6. **Status quo**: The world changes slowly. Current 6.00% prediction represents a stabilized post-escalation equilibrium. With only 11.5 days and no major catalysts, inertia strongly favors status quo or slight decline. This reinforces my 21% estimate.

Probability: 21%
