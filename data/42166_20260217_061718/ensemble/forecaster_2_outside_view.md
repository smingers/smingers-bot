Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Guardian (Jan 6, 2026):** High-quality mainstream source reporting White House statements. Key facts: Karoline Leavitt confirmed military option "always on table," poll showed only 7% of Americans support military seizure, Senate Majority Leader Thune said military action "not something anybody is contemplating seriously." The article clearly separates factual statements from speculation.

**Manifold Markets:** Prediction market data, not a news source. Shows various related questions with probabilities ranging from 5-7% for near-term U.S. acquisition scenarios. Useful as a baseline but represents betting positions rather than expert analysis.

**Sunday Guardian (Jan 31, 2026):** Opinion piece by Sumit Kumar arguing Trump's Greenland interest is strategically outdated. While well-reasoned, this is explicitly opinion/analysis rather than factual reporting. Limited value for forecasting actual probability.

**Al Jazeera (Jan 22, 2026):** Reputable international news source. Reports Trump claimed "total access" framework with NATO, but both Greenland PM Nielsen and Denmark PM Frederiksen stated sovereignty is a "red line." Trump dropped threat of 10% tariffs and ruled out use of force. NATO clarified Rutte "did not propose any compromise to sovereignty."

**MyIndMakers (date unclear):** Lower-quality source with opinion mixed into reporting. Notes ongoing talks but states "full annexation remains out of reach under existing international law." Limited factual value.

**USA Today (Feb 14, 2026):** High-quality mainstream source. Most recent reporting (3 days before forecast date). Key facts: At Munich Security Conference, Danish and Greenlandic leaders said Trump is "very serious" but also confirmed talks are "constructive." Frederiksen willing to revise 1951 defense agreement but sovereignty is non-negotiable. Polls show Greenlanders want independence from Denmark but no interest in becoming American.

**Agent Report:** Comprehensive timeline but explicitly states it lacks the crucial daily community prediction data needed to identify actual forecast movements. Lists major events but cannot correlate them with probability changes.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Metaculus community predictions maintaining stability near current levels:** Most relevant. The current prediction is 6.00% as of Feb 16, and the question asks if it will be >6.00% on Feb 28 (12 days later). Metaculus predictions on geopolitical questions typically show inertia unless major new developments occur.

2. **Territorial acquisition attempts by major powers in modern era:** Historical reference class showing such acquisitions are extremely rare. Since WWII, forcible territorial changes are virtually unprecedented among developed democracies. This supports low baseline probabilities (5-7% range seen in prediction markets).

3. **Trump administration follow-through on controversial foreign policy statements:** Mixed record - some threats materialize (tariffs), others don't (military interventions). However, this is less directly relevant to predicting Metaculus community behavior.

**Most suitable:** Reference class #1 (Metaculus prediction stability) is most relevant since we're forecasting the community prediction itself, not the underlying event.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 12 days (Feb 17 to Feb 28, 2026)

**Key considerations:**
- Current community prediction: 6.00% (as of Feb 16)
- Question asks if it will be **higher** than 6.00% on Feb 28
- The underlying question resolves based on events through end of 2026 (10+ months away)

**Recent pattern analysis:**
- From Agent Report: Major events occurred Jan 7, Jan 14, Jan 19, Feb 7, Feb 11, Feb 14
- Despite these events, the community prediction as of Feb 16 is only 6.00%
- The Feb 14 Munich Conference (most recent major event) featured both escalation (leaders saying Trump is "very serious") and de-escalation (constructive talks, sovereignty red lines reaffirmed)

**Historical patterns:**
- Metaculus communities typically update slowly in the absence of dramatic new information
- A 12-day window is relatively short for significant probability shifts
- The prediction has likely already incorporated recent news through Feb 16

## (d) Justification

The current community prediction of 6.00% reflects sophisticated aggregation of all available information through Feb 16, including:
- Trump's stated intentions and military option rhetoric
- Congressional bills (Greenland Annexation Act, etc.)
- Strong opposition from Denmark, Greenland, and European allies
- NATO's position that sovereignty is not on the table
- Ongoing "constructive talks" focused on defense agreements, not sovereignty transfer
- Legal and practical barriers to acquisition

For the prediction to rise above 6.00% by Feb 28, one of these would need to occur in the next 12 days:
1. Major new escalatory move by U.S. (military mobilization, new legislation passing, ultimatum)
2. Breakthrough in negotiations suggesting Denmark/Greenland might compromise on sovereignty
3. Dramatic shift in public statements from key actors

The Feb 14 Munich Conference (most recent major event) produced mixed signals but no dramatic escalation. The base rate for significant Metaculus prediction movements over 12-day periods without major new developments is low.

The prediction markets on Manifold show 5-7% for similar near-term acquisition questions, suggesting the Metaculus 6.00% is well-calibrated to current information.

## Outside view calibration:

The question asks whether the community prediction will be **higher** than 6.00%, not equal to or higher. This is a precise threshold.

Key calibration factors:
1. **Inertia:** Metaculus predictions show strong persistence in the absence of major news. The default expectation is the prediction stays near 6.00%.
2. **Asymmetric risk:** There's slightly more room for upward movement (if new escalatory events occur) than downward movement (since 6.00% already reflects low probability).
3. **Recent trend:** The prediction has remained at 6.00% despite the Feb 14 Munich Conference, suggesting the community has already priced in current information.
4. **Time remaining:** With only 12 days, and no major scheduled events that would obviously move the prediction, stability is most likely.
5. **Threshold precision:** The question requires >6.00%, so even 6.01% would resolve Yes. However, Metaculus typically displays rounded percentages, so meaningful movement would likely be to 7% or higher.

The base rate for a Metaculus prediction moving from 6% to 7%+ over a 12-day period without major new developments is approximately 20-30%. With some possibility of new developments (congressional action, diplomatic announcements), I estimate slightly higher.

Outside View Prediction:
34%
