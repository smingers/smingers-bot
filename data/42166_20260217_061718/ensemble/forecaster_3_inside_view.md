Analysis:
### 1) What’s being forecast (clarify resolution)
We’re forecasting whether the **Metaculus community prediction** for “Will the United States gain formal sovereignty over any part of Greenland during 2026?” will be **> 6.00% at 2026-02-28 16:49:57**. Current CP (2026-02-16) is **6.00%**.

### (a) Source analysis (quality, date, and what’s factual vs opinion)
- **The Arctic Institute (Jan 8, 2026)**: Expert-leaning policy analysis. High signal on structural/geostrategic arguments (outside view on feasibility), but largely interpretive. Main factual baseline: US already has Pituffik access; Denmark increasing defense spend. Opinion: sovereignty unnecessary for US goals.
- **Fair Observer (Feb 16, 2026)**: Commentary/analysis site; mixed reliability, more argumentative. Factual nuggets: Trump posting private message screenshots (if accurate), broader context. Mostly interpretive; treat as weak-to-moderate.
- **Vetromebel.com / Ryan Holloway (Feb 17, 2026)**: Unfamiliar outlet/aggregator; content overlaps with widely reported Munich statements. Use cautiously; factual claims that match other reports: Frederiksen says Trump still serious, sovereignty non-negotiable; working group exists; negotiations ongoing.
- **Guampdn letter (Feb 16, 2026)**: Opinion letter advocating COFA model. Not evidence of likelihood; useful only as “idea in discourse,” not as indicator of Metaculus movement.
- **CNN (Jan 21, 2026)**: High-quality mainstream reporting with direct quotes. Fact: Trump publicly ruled out using military force (at least rhetorically), shifting toward diplomacy/tariffs as leverage. Strong evidence about *reduced* near-term escalation risk.
- **The Guardian (Jan 7, 2026)**: High-quality reporting on White House spokesperson statement (“military always an option”) and Europe’s pushback. Strong evidence of earlier escalation but also of coordinated opposition.
- **AskNews items (various, Jan-Feb 2026)**:
  - **TIME (Feb 16)**: High-quality; indicates Europe reacting strongly, reinforcing opposition. Mostly political framing; moderate relevance.
  - **Xinhua / similar summaries (Feb 15)**: State-media but often accurate on public statements; overlaps with Munich messaging. Moderate.
  - **Space.com (Feb 15)**: Reputable; some speculative “rumors” about small remote areas for bases—explicitly unconfirmed; treat those rumors as weak evidence.
  - **Benzinga/Kalshi (Feb 10)** and **Nikkei Asia (Jan 14)**: Market-odds reporting (18–20% for “acquire part of Greenland”). This is relevant only insofar as Metaculus users might anchor to it; but definitional mismatch risk is high (Metaculus requires *formal sovereignty over ≥1%*).

### (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
**Strong (structural / hard-to-move constraints → downward/stable CP pressure):**
- **Repeated Denmark + Greenland leadership “sovereignty is non-negotiable / red lines”** (multiple outlets around Munich). This strongly suppresses belief in a binding sovereignty agreement in 2026.
- **Resolution criteria are stringent**: statute or binding agreement for **≥1% of Greenland’s land area**. Even a new base, expanded access, or defense responsibility *doesn’t* meet sovereignty. This creates “cap” pressure on CP.

**Moderate (could move CP slightly up or down):**
- **Existence of a formal US–Denmark–Greenland working group / negotiations ongoing**. Some forecasters may see “talks” as increased chance of a deal (upward), but most will interpret as channeling into defense/access arrangements (downward or neutral on sovereignty).
- **Trump’s rhetorical volatility**: prior military-option rhetoric (up), followed by Davos walkback (down). Net effect lately seems de-escalatory.

**Weak (small/ambiguous CP effects):**
- **Unconfirmed rumors** (e.g., “quietly discussed granting small remote areas”). Even if true, it’s likely basing/leases, not sovereignty ≥1%—but rumors can still nudge sentiment upward briefly.
- **Prediction market odds at ~18–20%**: could tug some Metaculus users upward, but likely discounted due to different definitions and because Metaculus crowd is often more criteria-literal.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Time left:** ~11–12 days (from 2026-02-17 to 2026-02-28).
- Over such a short window, Metaculus CP usually shows **inertia** unless a major headline changes the perceived pathway to meeting the *specific* criteria.
- If the window were **halved (~6 days)**: I’d expect even more inertia → lower chance CP rises above 6%.
- If the window were **doubled (~24 days)**: more chances for a rumor, draft agreement talk, or a Metaculus “reversion” toward market odds → modestly higher chance CP ends up >6%.

### (d) Justification (inside view adjustment from outside view base rate)
**Outside view base rate provided:** 34% for CP > 6.00% by Feb 28.

My inside view shifts **downward** because the latest, most repeated high-signal updates (Munich statements; working group framing; continued sovereignty red lines; Trump’s de-escalatory Davos posture) are **more consistent with “security cooperation without sovereignty transfer”**. That reduces the odds of new information arriving in the next ~11 days that would cause Metaculus median-weighted forecasts to tick upward. Meanwhile, the “talks are ongoing” narrative is likely already priced in at 6.00%, and absent a concrete sovereignty-path headline, small edits may drift down rather than up.

Net: **34% → 28%**.

Probability calibration:
- **Status quo if nothing big changes:** CP stays at/near 6.00% or drifts slightly down as novelty fades and criteria-literalism reasserts.
- **What would drive YES (CP > 6.00%) in the next 11 days?**
  - Credible report of a draft agreement involving territorial sovereignty (≥1%) or serious Congressional movement on annexation statute; or
  - A Metaculus-specific dynamic where a few high-weight recent forecasters push above the threshold (possible but I think less likely than stability/downward drift).
- **Sensitivity:** A ±10% swing would correspond to whether you expect “rumor/news noise” to dominate (push toward ~38%) or “inertia + criteria strictness” to dominate (push toward ~18%). I’m closer to the latter.

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: Will Metaculus CP for US gaining **formal sovereignty over ≥1% of Greenland in 2026** be **>6.00% on 2026-02-28**?
2) Outside view base rate: 34%.
3) Consistency check: “**28** out of 100 times, the Metaculus community prediction on 2026-02-28 is **higher than 6.00%**.” Reasonable given inertia + slight downward pressure.
4) Key evidence:
   - Denmark/Greenland reiterate sovereignty “non-negotiable” (Munich; multiple reports).
   - Trump walked back military-force option publicly (CNN).
   - Working group suggests channeling into defense/access, not sovereignty.
   - Criteria require formal sovereignty over ≥1% land—high bar that base/leases don’t meet.
5) Blind spot: A credible leak/announcement of a sovereignty-linked draft agreement (or serious US statutory move) could cause a sharp CP jump above 6%.
6) Status quo outcome: Stable/flat around 6% is the modal path over 11 days → favor “No”.

Probability: 28%
