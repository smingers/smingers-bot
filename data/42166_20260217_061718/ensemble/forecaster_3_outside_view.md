Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; facts vs opinions)

- **The Guardian (Jan 6, 2026)**  
  - **What it provides (facts):** On-the-record White House statement that military force is “always an option”; notes pushback from Denmark/Greenland/European leaders; includes a US poll figure (7% support military seizure).  
  - **Quality:** High-quality mainstream outlet; specific attributed quotes; date is relevant but ~6 weeks old.  
  - **Relevance to CP movement:** Clear “escalatory rhetoric” catalyst that could have raised the Metaculus probability earlier, but not necessarily sustaining upward movement into late Feb without additional concrete steps.

- **Al Jazeera (Jan 22, 2026)**  
  - **What it provides (facts):** Reports Trump claims of a “framework,” Denmark/Greenland calling sovereignty a “red line,” and NATO clarification that sovereignty wasn’t discussed; suggests negotiations on security access, not sovereignty transfer.  
  - **Quality:** Solid international outlet; largely wire-based; mixed political incentives in quoted parties, but the “NATO clarification” is important counterweight.  
  - **Relevance:** Net effect is ambiguous: “framework/negotiated” language can push CP up, but explicit denials of sovereignty compromise push it down.

- **USA TODAY (Feb 14, 2026)**  
  - **What it provides (facts):** Denmark and Greenland leaders say Trump is serious; talks started late Jan; Rubio meetings; suggestion that revising the 1951 defense agreement is “easy” compared to sovereignty changes; polling claim: Greenlanders may want independence eventually but not to become American.  
  - **Quality:** Mainstream; close in time (3 days ago); focuses on diplomacy.  
  - **Relevance:** Points toward **expanded basing/access** rather than sovereignty—often a “reversion-to-base-rate” signal for the underlying event, which can translate into modest CP drift downward.

- **The Sunday Guardian (Jan 31, 2026) — opinion/analysis**  
  - **What it provides:** Strategic argument that territorial acquisition is outdated and destabilizing.  
  - **Quality:** Opinion piece; not a direct indicator of actual negotiation probability.  
  - **Relevance:** Limited direct forecasting value for the Metaculus CP, except insofar as it reflects a broader elite narrative that may reduce enthusiasm.

- **MyIndMakers (undated in summary; appears Feb 2026-ish) — mixed but largely opinionated**  
  - **What it provides (some factual context):** History of US presence/basing; claims about protests and “ongoing talks” are plausible but not well-evidenced here.  
  - **Quality:** Lower; advocacy tone; treat as weak signal.  
  - **Relevance:** Could nudge attention but unlikely to be a decisive driver of Metaculus CP.

- **Manifold market summary (current probabilities on related questions)**  
  - **What it provides:** A rough “market” outside view: several related acquisition/sovereignty questions sit around **5–7%**.  
  - **Quality:** Prediction market (play money) is not “truth,” but it is a useful **sentiment anchor**.  
  - **Relevance:** Strongly suggests 6% is already near the prevailing “speculative but non-negligible” consensus; that can imply **limited upward room** absent new concrete developments.

- **Agent report (Feb 2026)**  
  - **What it provides:** Admits it cannot reconstruct the Metaculus time series; lists plausible catalysts (WH rhetoric, legislative proposals, NATO mission, Munich Security Conference).  
  - **Quality:** Useful synthesis, but key missing ingredient is the actual CP trajectory/volatility.  
  - **Relevance:** Confirms there have been multiple “attention spikes,” but we can’t quantify whether CP is trending up, mean-reverting, or stable.

### (b) Reference class analysis (for an *outside view* of “CP > 6% in ~2 weeks”)

Because the resolution is about the **Metaculus community prediction level**, not the underlying geopolitical event, the most relevant reference classes are about **short-horizon probability movements**:

1. **Metaculus CP movement over ~2-week windows for low-probability geopolitical “shock” questions (1–15% range).**  
   - Typical pattern: initial headline-driven spike, then **mean reversion** unless more concrete confirming developments occur.  
   - Suitability: High, but we lack direct historical series here.

2. **Prediction-market/forecast aggregates around “territorial acquisition/annexation” in modern era.**  
   - Base rate of actual annexation-by-agreement of allied territory is extremely low; forecasters often hover in low single digits unless crisis intensifies.  
   - Suitability: Medium—this is more about the “true event rate” than CP dynamics, but it informs where CP might drift.

3. **Cross-platform sentiment anchoring (Manifold similar markets ~5–7%).**  
   - Suggests “consensus plateau” around this level; CP may oscillate rather than trend sharply.  
   - Suitability: Medium-high as a numeric tether.

**Most suitable:** (1) CP drift/mean reversion in the 1–15% band, supplemented by (3) the Manifold anchor.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Now:** 2026-02-17  
- **Check date:** 2026-02-28  
- **Time left:** ~11–12 days.

In ~2-week windows on attention-driven geopolitical questions:
- If **no new concrete developments** occur, probabilities often **edge down** as “hot takes” cool and more base-rate-oriented forecasters participate.
- If a **new headline** hits (e.g., draft treaty text, parliamentary motion with real traction, leaked negotiation details implying sovereignty), CP can jump quickly—especially from low baselines.  
- However, the current news mix is more consistent with **security footprint negotiations** than sovereignty transfer, which tends to cap upside.

Also note the decision threshold is strict: **must be > 6.00%**; **= 6.00% counts as No**. If CP is somewhat “sticky” at round numbers, ties slightly favor “No.”

### (d) Justification (outside view)

- **Status quo:** CP is exactly **6.00%** as of Feb 16. With only ~12 days to go, absent a fresh catalyst, the outside-view expectation is *slight mean reversion* (downward drift) rather than a sustained rise.  
- **Why not >50% for “increase”?**  
  - The public record in the provided sources emphasizes **denials of sovereignty compromise** and plausibility of **expanded basing/access** as the realistic pathway—signals that typically reduce the probability of formal sovereignty transfer in 2026.  
  - Cross-platform market sentiment clusters around **5–7%**, suggesting we’re already near a “natural resting band.” From that band, movement is as likely down as up, and the strict “must be higher than 6.00” threshold plus possible stickiness at 6.00 creates a small tilt toward “No.”
- **What would drive “Yes” (CP > 6.00) by Feb 28)?**  
  - A credible report of **binding negotiations** including sovereignty; a draft agreement; formal legislative traction beyond symbolic bills; or a major escalation in US posture.  
- **What would drive “No” (CP ≤ 6.00)?**  
  - Quiet news cycle; clarifications that talks are strictly about defense access; allied pushback; forecasters reverting toward the near-term implausibility of formal sovereignty change.

Overall, the outside view is that **a small downward nudge or stagnation is slightly more likely than a sustained uptick** over this short horizon, but with meaningful tail risk of a headline-driven bump.

Outside view calibration:

- **Numeric tether:** Manifold-related markets around **5–7%** imply 6% is already a “consensus-ish” value.  
- **Upset rate / volatility:** Even with low true base rates, *forecast aggregates* can move on news. Over ~2 weeks, I’d expect a non-trivial chance (perhaps ~25–35%) of a headline changing sentiment meaningfully, but absent such a headline, drift is modest and often downward.  
- **Tie effect:** Since “= 6.00%” resolves No, that trims a few points from an otherwise ~50/50 “up vs not-up” intuition.

Net calibration: slightly below even odds that CP ends up **strictly above** 6.00%.

Outside View Prediction:
**43.2%**
