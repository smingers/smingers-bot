Analysis:
1. Paraphrase & resolution window  
   Between now (17 Feb 2026) and the observation time (28 Feb 2026 16:49 UTC), will the Metaculus community forecast for “US gains formal sovereignty over ≥1 % of Greenland in 2026” finish strictly above 6.00 %?

(a) Source analysis (quality, facts vs. opinion – dates in 2026 unless noted)  
• Guardian, 7 Jan – on-the-record WH statement that “military always an option”; reliable; six weeks old; mostly facts.  
• CNN, 21 Jan – Trump rules out force at Davos; reliable; factual quotes, three weeks old.  
• Arctic Institute, 8 Jan – expert commentary; high-quality think-tank; largely analysis/opinion.  
• Fair Observer, 16 Feb – recounts Macron leaks & Venezuelan raid; mixed fact/opinion; fresh.  
• Vetromebel & broad wire pick-ups, 17 Feb – Frederiksen at Munich: “desire unchanged, sovereignty non-negotiable”; factual; very fresh.  
• AskNews bundle – multiple identical points (Munich remarks, working group, NATO Arctic Sentry). Sources span CNN, Marca, Xinhua, Space.com, Benzinga, 10 Jan–17 Feb; mostly factual quotes, some speculative rumours.  
• Prediction-market articles (Kalshi, Polymarket) – data points: 18–20 % odds on 2026 annexation; reliable numeric snapshot, not proof of probability move.

(b) Evidence weighting relative to “CP > 6 %”  
Strong: none – no independent confirmation of sovereignty negotiations.  
Moderate (downward):  
  – Multiple fresh, public statements by Denmark & Greenland that sovereignty is a red line.  
  – Trump’s 21 Jan on-camera pledge not to use force.  
Moderate (upward):  
  – Persistent US rhetoric (“desire unchanged”, House bill, leaks of quiet talks) keeps issue alive and could spark new headlines.  
Weak: online rumours of land grants, fictional Foreign Affairs scenario pieces, Olympic protests.

Net: moderate downward pressure, modest headline-driven upside tail.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon = 11.5 days.  Typical Metaculus binary questions in the 5-10 % band drift ~0.2-0.5 pp/week toward the base rate if no fresh news; single headlines can move them 1-3 pp in hours.  If the horizon were halved (6 days) I’d shave another 3 pp off the “Yes” chance; if doubled (23 days) I’d add ~4 pp to allow more opportunity for a news pop.

(d) Justification & inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base (from historical CP movements for low-probability geopolitics) = 43 %.  
Adjustments:  
  – Tie-goes-to-No rule (must be > 6.00, not ≥) → -3 pp.  
  – Mean-reversion expectation, given cooling media cycle → -5 pp.  
  – Very fresh Munich quotes keep “Greenland” in headlines, raising chance of one more spike → +4 pp.  
  – 11-day window still leaves room for surprise leak or Congressional theatrics → +0 pp net (already in +4).  

Inside-view probability ≈ 39 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that 39 out of 100 times a Metaculus community forecast sitting at 6 % with 11 days left would finish above 6 % given the current mix of attention and counter-statements.”

Checklist:
• Outside view stated (43 %).  
• Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
  1. Fresh Danish & Greenlandic denials of any sovereignty deal.  
  2. Trump’s 21 Jan public rejection of military option.  
  3. CP presently exactly at threshold, historical drift usually downward.  
  4. Persistent US rhetoric keeps low-probability tail of new headline alive.  
• Blind-spot: a leaked draft treaty showing any sovereignty language before 28 Feb would likely push CP to 10-15 %.  
• Status-quo bias acknowledged; short horizon favours “No”.

Probability: 39%
