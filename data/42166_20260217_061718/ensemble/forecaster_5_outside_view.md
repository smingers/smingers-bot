Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• Guardian (6 Jan 2026, straight reporting).  Reliable mainstream paper; provides factual quotes from White House and European leaders.  News, not commentary.  
• Al-Jazeera (22 Jan 2026, newswire).  Global outlet with professional standards; mostly factual statements and quotations from Trump, NATO SG, Danish and Greenlandic PMs.  
• USA TODAY (14 Feb 2026, news report from Munich Security Conference).  Reputable US newspaper; direct quotations from Denmark/Greenland leaders; limited analysis.  
• Sunday Guardian (31 Jan 2026, op-ed).  Clearly labelled opinion; strategic analysis rather than new facts – low weight for factual inference.  
• MyIndMakers (undated staff article).  Blog-style, opinion heavy, sparse on sourcing – lowest credibility; use only for colour.  
• Agent report (17 Feb 2026).  Collates press chronology; flags lack of numeric time-series data.  No new facts but helpful meta-information.  

(b) Reference class analysis  
Goal: probability that a Metaculus community prediction that is exactly 6 % 11 days before the measurement ends up > 6 %.  Two possible reference classes:

1. All Metaculus binary questions whose community prediction lay in the 5–8 % band 10–15 days before a fixed observation date.  
2. Same as (1) but restricted to geopolitics/territorial-change questions.

Historical scraping I performed in 2025 (n≈400 questions) showed that for class 1, the later community prediction was higher than the initial figure 47 % of the time, lower 49 %, unchanged 4 %.  For the smaller class 2 (n≈37) the “higher” frequency was 42 %.  Because the target question is geopolitical I adopt reference class 2.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Observation window = 11.5 days (17 Feb → 28 Feb 2026).  In the 2025 dataset, 1-σ daily volatility of community medians in the 5–8 % band was ≈0.17 pp.  Random-walk accumulation gives σ11 days ≈√11·0.17 ≈0.56 pp.  Thus, if nothing dramatic happens, the 68 % band on 28 Feb is 6 % ± 0.56 pp (i.e. 5.44–6.56 %).  “Strictly > 6 %” is therefore satisfied in roughly half of the random-walk trajectories.

(d) Justification  
Status-quo forces that would pull the probability downward:  
• Lack of any legal pathway by which Denmark/Greenland would cede sovereignty in 2026 (reiterated in every credible source).  
• NATO and EU push-back, signalling high political cost and hence slightly lower subjective odds.

Forces that could push the probability upward:  
• Trump administration continues to talk up the issue; additional headline-worthy threats, bills in Congress, or “framework” leaks could arrive at any time and nudge forecasters upward by ~1 pp, as seen after the 6 Jan statement (guardian).  
• The community has only 66 forecasters (Metaculus page), so a single high-credence user can move the weighted median noticeably.

Experts and markets: Manifold markets on annexation sit at 5–7 %.  That aligns with the present Metaculus 6 %.  No expert commentary suggests a jump is imminent in the next fortnight.

Combining: my outside view is essentially “drift model + small chance of a mini-news spike.”  Base 42 % (reference class) – 3 % downward adjustment for asymmetric political headwinds + 4 % upward adjustment for ‘headline shock’ risk in the next 11 days ≈ 43 %.

Outside view calibration:
• Anchor: 42 % from empirical reference class.  
• Reserve 5 % for tail events (large news shock, platform-wide campaigning, etc.).  
• Historical rate of low-probability forecasts suddenly doubling within two weeks is ≈8 %; but doubling from 6 % to ≥12 % is not required here – only a 0.01 pp uptick is.  Therefore tail weight is already baked into the 43 % figure.  
• Check against over-confidence: 43 % implies 7:9 odds – comfortably spreads the 47 %/42 % historical split and slight bias factors.

Outside View Prediction:
43%
