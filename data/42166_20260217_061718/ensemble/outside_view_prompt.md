Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41502
- Original question title: Will the United States gain formal sovereignty over any part of Greenland during 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 6.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as Yes if, before 2027, at least one of the following occur:
> 
> 1. The United States controls Greenland and any part of Greenland comes under formal sovereignty of the United States, defined as the US government enacting a statute that declares 1% or more of the land area of Greenland to under the sovereignty of the United States.&#x20;
> 2. A binding agreement which grants the United States sovereignty over 1% or more of the land area of Greenland, even if implementation is pending, is formally agreed upon by the U.S government and either the Government of Denmark and/or the Government of Greenland.

> 
> > In January 2026, the White House stated that using the US military to acquire Greenland was “always an option,” prompting strong pushback from Denmark, Greenland, and European leaders. Greenland’s government has repeatedly stated that it does not wish to become part of the United States.
> 
> > “President Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it’s vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region. The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the commander-in-chief’s disposal,” White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41502) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-28 16:49:57 is higher than 6.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 6.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-28 16:49:57, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

## Summary of Article: "Trump's Greenland dream is a chimera in a Hypervelocity Age"

**Source:** The Sunday Guardian  
**Date:** January 31, 2026  
**Author:** Sumit Kumar

### Key Arguments and Analysis:

**Strategic Critique:**
- The article argues that Trump's renewed interest in Greenland (articulated from Iceland) reflects outdated 20th-century strategic thinking that equates territorial control with security
- The author contends that in the modern "Hypervelocity Age" characterized by hypersonic weapons, compressed decision cycles, cognitive warfare, and climate stress, geography alone no longer delivers assumed security outcomes
- Fixed geography and territorial buffers that provided strategic advantage during the Cold War now offer only "marginal advantage against multidirectional threats"
- Modern security flows more from "resilience: dispersion of assets, redundancy of systems, technological adaptability and—critically—cognitive preparedness" rather than territorial possession

**Legal and Legitimacy Concerns:**
- Any coercive move against Greenland would violate core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity enshrined in the UN Charter
- Such actions would undermine the post-1945 international legal order and normalize grey-zone behavior
- The author warns this could "lower thresholds for escalation and accelerate militarisation"

**Alliance and Geopolitical Implications:**
- A coercive move would strain EU and NATO unity, as Greenland is inseparable from Denmark, a NATO ally
- Could undermine NATO's moral center and trust among smaller members
- Russia would likely accelerate Arctic militarization in response
- China's official response has emphasized respect for territorial integrity while positioning itself as a "near-Arctic state" engaged in scientific cooperation

**Arctic Environmental Concerns:**
- The Arctic is warming at nearly three times the global average
- The region faces "grey rhino" risks including methane release, permafrost degradation, and cascading climate disruptions
- Militarizing the Arctic under these conditions is described as "strategically myopic"
- The Arctic has been governed through cooperation via institutions like the Arctic Council; undermining this framework would signal retreat from multilateralism

**Conclusion:**
The author argues that Greenland represents "a test of strategic maturity" rather than a strategic prize, suggesting that true 21st-century power lies in governance, restraint, and wisdom rather than territorial domination.

**Note:** This is an opinion piece presenting strategic analysis rather than reporting factual developments about U.S. acquisition efforts.

# Summary of Article: "Greenland and Denmark say sovereignty 'red line' after latest Trump remarks"

**Source:** Al Jazeera (by News Agencies)

## Key Facts and Developments:

**Statements on Sovereignty:**
- Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen stated that sovereignty is a "red line" that cannot be crossed, emphasizing the need to respect territorial integrity and international law
- Nielsen said he doesn't know what's in the agreement/deal about Greenland reached between Trump and NATO chief Mark Rutte
- Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also said discussions about Denmark's sovereignty are off the table and "cannot be changed"

**Trump's Claims:**
- Trump claimed to have secured "total access" to Greenland under a framework agreed with NATO chief Mark Rutte
- In a Fox Business Network interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump said the framework would give the US "total access" with "no end, there's no time limit"
- Trump stated "It's really being negotiated now, the details of it"
- Trump dropped his threat to impose 10% tariffs on European countries opposed to his Greenland bid and ruled out the use of force

**NATO and Security Framework:**
- NATO chief Mark Rutte told Reuters the framework agreement would require NATO countries to swiftly ramp up security efforts in the Arctic to ward off threats from Russia and China
- Rutte said he hopes this can be done "quite fast," ideally early in 2026
- NATO spokesperson Allison Hart clarified that Rutte "did not propose any compromise to sovereignty during his meeting with President Trump"
- Mineral exploitation on Greenland was not discussed in the Trump-Rutte meeting, according to Rutte

**Other Elements:**
- Trump mentioned a "Golden Dome" missile defense program (a $175 billion system that would put US weapons in space for the first time)
- Denmark is open to discussing a 1951 pact with the US, "but it has to be in the framework of us as a sovereign state," according to Frederiksen
- German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed Trump's U-turn on Greenland and urged Europeans not to write off the transatlantic partnership too quickly

**Context:**
- The article notes Trump has ramped up threats to seize Greenland in recent weeks, claiming it's needed for US national security and to prevent Chinese or Russian inroads in the Arctic
- The push has "plunged US-European relations to their lowest point in decades and prompted fears for the survival of NATO"
- European governments remain wary of another change of mind by Trump, who "is increasingly seen as a bully that Europe needs to stand up to," according to observers

## Key Facts and Context:

**Historical Background:**
- U.S. interest in Greenland dates to the 19th century when Secretary of State William H. Seward considered acquiring Greenland and Iceland, similar to the Alaska Purchase
- In 1867, the U.S. commissioned surveys for economic and strategic benefits; Denmark rejected these overtures
- During WWII (1941), the U.S. signed a Defence of Greenland agreement

**Current Situation (2026):**
- Since the beginning of 2026, President Trump has made repeated statements about acquiring Greenland "by any means" for national security reasons
- Greenland has approximately 57,000 residents, predominantly Inuit
- Greenland is an autonomous, self-governing island within the Kingdom of Denmark

**Responses to U.S. Claims:**
- Denmark's government stated "you cannot annex another country"
- Greenland's premier denied any deal to surrender sovereignty
- Leaders of Greenland's parliamentary parties jointly condemned U.S. annexation plans
- Large-scale protests occurring in both Greenland and Denmark with slogans like "Greenland is not for sale"
- Allied nations warned against undermining NATO unity

**Strategic Importance Cited:**
- Arctic geopolitics amid rising Russian and Chinese activity

**Broader U.S. Territorial Ambitions Mentioned:**
- The current administration has also discussed acquiring Canada as the 51st state, renaming the Gulf of Mexico, and reclaiming control of the Panama Canal

**Opinion (Named Source):**
- Senator Lindsey Graham reinforced acquisitive stance with statement: "Who gives a s*** who owns Greenland?"

**Current Status:**
- Reports indicate ongoing talks between U.S. and Denmark about expanded military access agreements
- Article notes full annexation "remains out of reach under existing international law"

**Article's Perspective (Opinion - MyIndMakers Staff):**
The article presents a critical view of U.S. actions, characterizing them as "imperial impulses" and "naked expansionist ambitions" disguised as responses to Chinese and Russian threats. It emphasizes the clash between U.S. expansionist ideology and Greenlandic self-determination.

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide daily history of the community prediction for Metaculus question 41502 through 2026-02-17, highlight major jumps, and list contemporaneous news events about U.S. moves toward acquiring Greenland.
1.  Available evidence on daily community-prediction history  
 • None of the articles or forum posts returned in the searches contains a day-by-day numerical record for Metaculus question 41502.  
 • No snapshots from the Metaculus website itself (e.g., via the public API or the Wayback Machine) were captured in the results set.  
 • Therefore we cannot now reconstruct a table of the community prediction from launch through 2026-02-17, nor can we quantify when the probability crossed particular thresholds or jumped by specific percentage points.  
 • Because those numbers are essential to answering “Will the community prediction be higher than 6 % on 2026-02-28?”, a direct scrape of Metaculus or an archive source is still required.

2.  Major qualitative events likely to have moved the forecast  
Although we do not yet have the numeric forecast series, the news record shows several clear catalysts that plausibly produced upward spikes in community probability.  Chronologically:  
 • 7 Jan 2026 – White House confirms “military force is always an option” for taking Greenland (BBC; Al Jazeera; MS NOW).  This is the first explicit threat in the new term and would reasonably push the forecast up from its long-run ~3 – 4 % baseline.  
 • 8 Jan 2026 – Danish and Greenlandic envoys rush to Washington to lobby against a “takeover” (Boston Herald).  
 • 14 Jan 2026 – High-level summit at the White House with Danish, Greenlandic and U.S. officials (BBC 14 Jan 2026).  President Trump again states he wants the territory “the easy way or the hard way.”  
 • 19 Jan 2026 – Rep. Randy Fine files the “Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act,” granting congressional authority for annexation by “any means necessary” (WNDB 19 Jan 2026).  
 • 21 Jan 2026 – CNN publishes constitutional analysis: how the U.S. could legally acquire Greenland (CNN 21 Jan 2026).  
 • 7 Feb 2026 – NATO announces “Arctic Sentry” mission to reassure allies (quoted in several stories).  
 • 11 Feb 2026 – Trump says “we’re negotiating right now for Greenland,” signalling ongoing talks (Al Jazeera 14 Feb 2026).  
 • 14 Feb 2026 – Munich Security Conference: Danish and Greenlandic leaders concede Trump is “very serious” about acquisition; Secretary of State Rubio meets them but gives no assurances (Al Jazeera & USA Today, both 14 Feb 2026).  

   Each of these items represents new U.S. governmental steps (legislative proposals, diplomatic meetings, public threats) that forecasters typically treat as evidence the probability should rise; they are prime candidates for “major jumps” once the numerical series is obtained.

3.  Contemporaneous news events summarised  
 • Military option explicitly on the table (BBC, Al Jazeera, MS NOW – 7 Jan 2026).  
 • Intensive diplomatic lobbying by Denmark & Greenland in Washington (Boston Herald – 8 Jan 2026).  
 • White House summit including VP Vance and SecState Rubio; Trump re-asserts intent (BBC – 14 Jan 2026).  
 • Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act introduced in House (WNDB – 19 Jan 2026).  
 • Multiple congressional Republican bills (“Make Greenland Great Again Act,” “Red, White & Blueland Act”) seek to fast-track annexation (NPR 12 Feb 2025; Fulcrum 21 Feb 2025; WNDB 19 Jan 2026).  
 • CNN constitutional analysis outlines possible legal pathways (CNN – 21 Jan 2026).  
 • European & NATO allies issue joint statements backing Danish sovereignty; NATO rolls out “Arctic Sentry” patrols (BBC 7 Jan 2026; Al Jazeera 14 Feb 2026).  
 • Munich Security Conference underscores the crisis; Rubio, Frederiksen, Nielsen all confirm talks continue but risk remains (Al Jazeera & USA Today 14 Feb 2026).

4.  Information still missing  
 a. Daily numerical community prediction values from question launch through 17 Feb 2026.  
 b. Exact dates and magnitudes of forecast “jumps” so they can be matched to the news timeline above.

Without that dataset, we cannot finish the requested historical table or highlight numeric jumps.  Access to either:  
 • Metaculus’s public time-series API (if enabled for q. 41502),  
 • the site’s CSV export, or  
 • archived daily snapshots (e.g., Wayback Machine, The Internet Archive’s mementos)
