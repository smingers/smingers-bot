    "description": "Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41502\n- Original question title: Will the United States gain formal sovereignty over any part of Greenland during 2026?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 6.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> This question will resolve as Yes if, before 2027, at least one of the following occur:\n> \n> 1. The United States controls Greenland and any part of Greenland comes under formal sovereignty of the United States, defined as the US government enacting a statute that declares 1% or more of the land area of Greenland to under the sovereignty of the United States.&#x20;\n> 2. A binding agreement which grants the United States sovereignty over 1% or more of the land area of Greenland, even if implementation is pending, is formally agreed upon by the U.S government and either the Government of Denmark and/or the Government of Greenland.\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> No fine print provided\n\nOriginal background: \n> [White House says using US military is \u2018always an option\u2019 for seizing Greenland](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/jan/06/trump-greenland-control-us-military):\n> \n> > In January 2026, the White House stated that using the US military to acquire Greenland was \u201calways an option,\u201d prompting strong pushback from Denmark, Greenland, and European leaders. Greenland\u2019s government has repeatedly stated that it does not wish to become part of the United States.\n> \n> > \u201cPresident Trump has made it well known that acquiring Greenland is a national security priority of the United States, and it\u2019s vital to deter our adversaries in the Arctic region. The president and his team are discussing a range of options to pursue this important foreign policy goal, and of course, utilizing the US military is always an option at the commander-in-chief\u2019s disposal,\u201d White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41502,\"question_id\":41231,\"last_cp\":0.06}}`",

If it is lower or equal to 6.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled.
