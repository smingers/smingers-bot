Analysis:
The Metaculus community prediction will only rise above 6 % in the next eleven days if fresh signals appear that the United States might actually obtain (or seriously pursue) sovereignty over some part of Greenland. Therefore, the most informative stories are:
• Any new U.S. governmental actions (bills in Congress, executive orders, Defense or State Department statements).  
• Formal talks, agreements, or public comments from Denmark or Greenland’s governments.  
• Leaks or authoritative reporting on U.S. military planning or diplomatic negotiations concerning Greenland.  
• Expert commentary indicating a meaningful shift in feasibility or political will since the last (6 %) snapshot.

Hence the queries focus on very recent (2026) developments linking “United States”, “Greenland”, “sovereignty”, “purchase”, “military option”, “negotiations”, “agreement”, “bill”, or “treaty”.
