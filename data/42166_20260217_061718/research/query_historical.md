Analysis:
The outcome hinges on short-term movements (next 11 days) in the Metaculus community prediction, which is presently exactly 6 %.  To judge how likely it is to rise above that threshold we need:
• The historical trajectory and volatility of this particular Metaculus question (how often and by how much it moves).  
• Precedent from similar Metaculus geopolitics questions (typical last-fortnight drift).  
• Any recent or emerging news about U.S.–Greenland/Danish negotiations, legislation, or military statements that could plausibly jolt forecasts upward before Feb 28.  
• Evidence of scheduled events (e.g., Congressional hearings, diplomatic summits) in the next two weeks that forecasters might weigh.

Therefore the searches focus on (1) the Metaculus question’s past prediction data, (2) recent and potential future news about U.S. sovereignty ambitions in Greenland, and (3) broader commentary that may link news spikes to forecast movements.
