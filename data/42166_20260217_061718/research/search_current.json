Center for Circumpolar Security Studies  \n**Date:** January 8, 2026  \n**Author:** Andreas \u00d8sthagen\n\n## Key Facts and Analysis:\n\n### Economic Motivations:\n- Greenland has large proven resources and several active mines extracting minerals\n- Trump appears driven by desire for economic gain through giving American companies special access to deals and opportunities\n- Rumored that an Australian geologist made Trump aware of Greenland's resource potential in 2019\n- **Author's assessment:** The US does not need sovereignty over Greenland to access resources; companies, not governments, extract resources\n- Alaska has great untapped mineral potential as an alternative\n\n### Strategic/Military Considerations:\n- **Russian nuclear threat:** Russia's strategic nuclear weapons are mostly located on the Kola Peninsula (near Norway), not near Greenland\n- The US already has Pituffik military base on northwest Greenland where US Space Force monitors potential Russian threats\n- Russian naval vessels do not sail around Greenland; they operate in the Barents Sea around Svalbard and along the Norwegian coast\n- **Chinese activity:** Chinese ships mainly sail to/from Russia and outside Alaska, not around Greenland\n- Chinese companies have been interested in investing in Greenland mining, but many projects put on hold for security reasons\n\n### Potential Concessions Denmark May Have to Make:\n- Denmark has already promised to invest over 6 billion USD in defense capabilities in Greenland\n- Denmark will buy more F-35 fighter jets and P-8 surveillance aircraft from the US\n- **Author suggests possible additional concessions:**\n  - Further release of mining areas, possibly prioritizing American companies (would violate competition rules and Greenlandic self-determination)\n  - Building a new Danish and/or American base on the island\n  - Symbolic defense agreement where US officially becomes responsible for Greenland's defense\n  - Denmark sending frigates and fighter jets to Alaska for exercises\n\n### Trump's Broader Doctrine:\n- Trump's January 4 press conference referenced the Monroe Doctrine (1823) about preventing other countries from interfering in the American continent\n- Trump administration appears to embrace \"19th century great power politics\" where the most powerful nation controls its immediate vicinity\n- This approach extends to Panama, Cuba, Venezuela, and Greenland\n- **Author's warning:** This represents a zero-sum game mindset that the world has largely evolved away from\n\n### Author's Opinion:\nThe author (Andreas \u00d8sthagen) is skeptical of Trump's justifications and warns this approach threatens international norms and could justify similar territorial claims by other powers (e.g., Russia over Svalbard).\n\n**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off at the end.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.fairobserver.com/world-news/donald-trumps-quest-for-greenland-and-the-future-of-multilateralism/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Donald Trump's Quest for Greenland and the Future of Multilateralism\"\n\n**Source:** Fair Observer  \n**Date:** February 16, 2026  \n**Author:** Jalaluddin Rizqi Mulia\n\n## Key Facts and Context:\n\n1. **Recent Events:**\n   - Trump publicly posted screenshots of private messages with European leaders including French President Emmanuel Macron, Norwegian PM Jonas Gahr St\u00f8re, and NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte, apparently to expose their private thoughts regarding his Greenland ambitions\n   - This occurred days after the US military's \"Operation Absolute Resolve\" on January 3, 2026, which captured Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro in Caracas without Congressional or UN approval\n\n2. **Historical/Legal Context:**\n   - The US recognized Greenland's autonomy as part of Denmark in 1916 when Denmark sold the Danish West Indies (now US Virgin Islands)\n   - The 1951 and 2004 Defense of Greenland Agreements with Denmark further solidified this recognition\n   - The US currently has approximately 150 service members stationed in Greenland, including at the Pituffik Space Base\n   - The US has had extensive military access to Greenland since the Cold War under past agreements\n\n3. **Trump's Stated Rationale:**\n   - National security concerns that Russia or China might take over the island\n   - Trump has openly discussed acquiring Greenland \"the hard way,\" explicitly defined as military operations\n\n## Analysis/Opinions (Author's perspective):\n\n- The author characterizes Trump's approach as having two elements: (1) securitization based on an \"imperialist narrative\" and (2) a worldview that potentially violates international order and NATO itself\n- The author notes the paradox that Greenland is already part of NATO and the EU (as an autonomous region of Denmark), making military action against it an attack on a NATO member\n- The author argues this approach undermines multilateralism and the rules-based international order\n- Concerns are raised that such actions could set precedents for other great powers (Russia regarding Ukraine, China regarding Taiwan)\n\n## Domestic Opposition:\n\n- Opposition has emerged from members of Trump's own party\n- Congress members have proposed measures in response (specifically mentioned regarding Venezuela action, though these failed to pass the Senate)\n\n**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off at the end.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.vetromebel.com/17-186971-danish-pm-says-trumps-desire-over-greenland-still-the-same-despite-ongoing-talks/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Danish PM says Trump's desire over Greenland still 'the same' despite ongoing talks\"\n\n**Source:** Vetromebel.com  \n**Date:** February 17, 2026  \n**Author:** Ryan Holloway\n\n## Key Facts and Statements:\n\n### Danish and Greenlandic Leadership Statements:\n\n- **Danish PM Mette Frederiksen** at the Munich Security Conference stated that Trump's ambition to gain control of Greenland \"has not faded\" and \"the desire from the US president is exactly the same. He's very serious about this.\"\n\n- Frederiksen emphasized that sovereignty is \"non-negotiable\" for Denmark and Greenland, with no price tag that could be placed on the territory. She noted Greenlanders have made clear they do not want to be American.\n\n- **Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen** said Trump had been \"transparent\" about his ambition to acquire the island. He described Trump's threats as \"outrageous\" and noted that Greenlanders now feel pressure from the US (a NATO ally) rather than from Russia or China.\n\n- Nielsen asked: \"Imagine a Nato country acquiring an ally\u2026 where would the world stand if that happened?\"\n\n### Timeline of Recent Events:\n\n- The current situation began earlier in 2026 when Trump spoke publicly about wanting the US to \"own\" Greenland for security reasons.\n\n- The White House initially signaled all options were on the table, including use of force.\n\n- Trump threatened tariffs on eight European allies, including the UK, after they opposed US acquisition of Greenland.\n\n- At the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump said he would not use \"excessive force,\" stating the US would be \"frankly unstoppable\" if it chose to use force but adding \"I won't do that.\"\n\n- The US has shifted to a more diplomatic track, with negotiations now ongoing between the US, Denmark, and Greenland. A formal working group is in place.\n\n### NATO and Arctic Security Developments:\n\n- NATO is accelerating its military presence in the Arctic through a new framework called **Arctic Sentry**, unveiled in Munich.\n\n- **Finnish President Alexander Stubb** said the exercise would involve around 20,000 soldiers.\n\n- **German Defense Minister Boris Pistorius** thanked European allies for collectively pushing back on Trump's demands, warning that threats from one NATO ally against another damage the alliance.\n\n### Strategic Context:\n\n- **Alaska Senator Lisa Murkowski** described growing concern over Russia and China working together in the Arctic, arguing that talk of acquiring Greenland distracts from \"the real issue, the real threat, which is Russia.\"\n\n- **Canadian Foreign Minister Anita Anand** noted that about 40% of Canada's landmass borders the Arctic, making it a central security priority.\n\n- The US already has significant presence in Greenland through existing defense agreements, including the Thule Air Base.\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer:** The article begins with several unrelated opinion statements before transitioning to the Greenland topic.

Despite gaining Home Rule in 1979 and expanded self-government in 2009\u2014allowing control over natural resources and local policing\u2014Greenland still lacks full independence, with Denmark retaining authority over defense, foreign policy, and economic support. The island's strategic significance grew during the Cold War, when the U.S. established Thule Air Base and integrated Greenland into NATO defense planning, often without local consent, including the forced relocation of Inuit communities. In January 2026, the United States publicly expressed interest in acquiring Greenland, citing strategic importance due to its location, critical minerals, and role in Arctic security. However, experts argue that neither Russia nor China pose an immediate threat to U.S. Arctic dominance, and the U.S. already maintains military superiority and cooperation with Denmark and NATO. The push for acquisition is framed as precautionary rather than necessary, revealing a pattern where great powers justify control based on hypothetical future risks rather than present needs. Greenland\u2019s leaders and Denmark have firmly rejected the idea of selling the island, emphasizing that its future must be determined by its people. The article argues that Greenland\u2019s value lies not in its strategic utility to external powers, but in the rights of its inhabitants to self-determination. The central question raised is: who truly decides the fate of a territory that everyone needs, but no one fully represents? The piece concludes that legitimacy in territorial claims must rest on consent, not power, and that ignoring Greenlanders\u2019 voices undermines both justice and long-term stability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 08:26 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@.CAP/the-case-of-greenland-3f54ae64033b)\n\n**E.U. Leaders Reject U.S. 'Civilizational Erasure' Claim**\nE.U. leaders are advocating for greater European sovereignty amid deteriorating relations with the United States. German Finance Minister Lars Klingbeil stated on Monday that the goal is to 'cut through knots' and strengthen Europe's sovereignty, calling the moment 'a very European moment.' He referenced President Donald Trump's 2025 attempt to acquire Greenland, including threats to impose tariffs on European nations opposing the move, as a wake-up call that has unified European leaders to prioritize collective interests over national ones and to be willing to compromise. This shift reflects a growing determination to assert autonomy in foreign policy and strategic decision-making.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 08:04 PM\nSource:[TIME](https://time.com/7379005/european-sovereignty-leaders-rally-against-us-erasure-claims/)\n\n**Land of Ice and Light: Greenland Crowned As A Must-Visit Arctic Wonderland For Adventurous Travellers! - Travel And Tour World**\nGreenland has emerged as a premier Arctic destination following major infrastructure upgrades, including the expansion of Nuuk International Airport to 2,200 meters, enabling direct jet service from Copenhagen and New York, with United Airlines launching routes from Newark. This enhanced connectivity, part of Greenland's strategy to diversify beyond fisheries, has driven a 44% increase in high-season bookings in 2025. The island's appeal lies in its natural wonders\u2014such as the Ilulissat Icefjord, Disko Bay for whale safaris and Northern Lights viewing\u2014and its cultural depth, including Inuit heritage and Norse ruins. Tourism is being managed sustainably, with a 2035 goal that 80% of residents feel a positive impact. Political tensions, fueled by U.S. interest and former President Donald Trump\u2019s comments on Greenland\u2019s strategic value, have sparked a geopolitical tourism boom, though Prime Minister M\u00fate Egede reaffirms Greenland is 'not for sale' and emphasizes self-determination. Revenue from tourism is seen as vital for fiscal autonomy from Denmark. New developments include boutique hotels in Nuuk, New Greenlandic Cuisine featuring musk ox and reindeer, and cultural education programs. Regional airports in Ilulissat and Qaqortoq are set to be fully operational by 2026, aiming to distribute tourism evenly. Environmental protections include strict cruise emissions rules and low-impact trekking. The 2024\u20132033 Foreign, Security, and Defense Strategy, 'Nothing about us without us,' mandates Greenlandic-led development. The convergence of pristine wilderness, ancient culture, and Arctic sovereignty dynamics makes Greenland a compelling global destination.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 11:39 AM\nSource:[Travel And Tour World](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/land-of-ice-and-light-greenland-crowned-as-a-must-visit-arctic-wonderland-for-adventurous-travellers/)\n\n**Trump's desire to obtain Greenland remains unchanged: Danish PM Mette Frederiksen**\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stated at the Munich Security Conference on Saturday, February 15, 2026, that US President Donald Trump's desire to acquire Greenland remains unchanged and that Trump is 'very serious' about the issue. Frederiksen emphasized that Greenland's right to self-determination is paramount, noting that 'the Greenlandic people have been very clear: they don't want to become Americans.' She confirmed the establishment of a US-Denmark-Greenland working group to address U.S. security concerns in the Arctic, calling it a positive step. However, she reiterated that Denmark has 'red lines' that will not be crossed and that the country will 'stick to our strategy.' While concerns about a potential U.S. military seizure of Greenland have eased\u2014following Trump's public rejection of military force during talks in Davos, as reported by Xinhua\u2014Frederiksen maintained that sovereignty and self-determination remain non-negotiable. The statement was made on February 16, 2026, according to The Sentinel Newspaper.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 04:51 AM\nSource:[The Sentinel Newspaper](https://www.sentinelassam.com/more-news/international/trumps-desire-to-obtain-greenland-remains-unchanged-danish-pm-mette-frederiksen)\n\n**Danish PM Confirms Trump's Continued Interest in 'Acquiring' Greenland, Stresses 'Red Lines' Will Not Be Crossed**\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stated that U.S. President Donald Trump continues to express a desire to 'acquire' Greenland, emphasizing that this intent remains unchanged despite diplomatic discussions. According to Frederiksen, the U.S. government's position is 'exactly the same' and 'very serious,' but she reiterated that Greenlanders have clearly rejected becoming part of the United States. The Danish government maintains that sovereignty over Greenland is non-negotiable, with 'red lines' that will not be crossed. While the U.S. has reduced its rhetoric\u2014abandoning threats of military force and new tariffs\u2014interest in Greenland persists due to its strategic Arctic location, natural resources, and potential maritime routes. A tripartite working group involving the U.S., Denmark, and Greenland is addressing security concerns in the Arctic without altering sovereignty. Greenland, an autonomous territory within the Danish Realm, controls internal affairs, while Denmark manages defense and foreign policy. The issue has intensified since Trump's return to power in 2025, though current talks focus on cooperation rather than territorial change.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 08:46 PM\nSource:[EL IMPARCIAL | Noticias de M\u00e9xico y el mundo](https://www.elimparcial.com/mundo/2026/02/15/primera-ministra-danesa-afirma-que-el-deseo-de-trump-de-obtener-groenlandia-es-exactamente-el-mismo-y-subraya-que-hay-lineas-rojas-que-no-se-cruzaran-pese-al-dialogo-con-eeuu-sobre-seguridad-en-el-artico/)\n\n**Trump's Greenland grab is part of a new space race - and the stakes are getting higher**\nUS President Donald Trump has repeatedly emphasized the strategic importance of Greenland, shifting from threats to take it by force to assurances he won't, but consistently asserting its value to American interests. Within hours of his speech at the 2026 Davos summit, rumors emerged that the US and Denmark had quietly discussed granting the US small, remote areas of Greenland for new military sites, though no official confirmation exists. This speculation reflects a broader geopolitical pivot: Greenland is increasingly central to US ambitions in both the Arctic and outer space. The island hosts Pituffik Space Base (formerly Thule Air Base), a critical hub for the US Space Force, vital for missile detection, climate monitoring, and space surveillance. As global tensions rise and space becomes a contested domain, Greenland\u2019s high-latitude geography offers ideal conditions for launching satellites into polar and sun-synchronous orbits, making it a prime candidate for a future Arctic launch hub. However, the 1967 Outer Space Treaty, designed for a bipolar world with few satellites, is now inadequate for managing private mega-constellations, commercial lunar projects, and asteroid mining. The treaty\u2019s core principles are under strain as major powers treat both terrestrial and orbital domains as strategic assets rather than global commons. The concentration of space surveillance capabilities in few hands\u2014especially through control of sites like Pituffik\u2014raises concerns about equitable governance. The Arctic Council is paralyzed by geopolitical tensions, and international space governance bodies like the UN Committee on the Peaceful Uses of Outer Space are unable to keep pace with innovation. For Greenlanders, the island\u2019s growing strategic value brings both leverage and vulnerability as they navigate potential independence from Denmark amid rising global power competition. Greenland is no longer just a territorial curiosity\u2014it has become a frontline for the future of space governance, exposing the fragility of the current international legal order.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 03:00 PM\nSource:[Space.com](https://www.space.com/astronomy/earth/trumps-greenland-grab-is-part-of-a-new-space-race-and-the-stakes-are-getting-higher)\n\n**Greenland Defies Trump on the Olympic Ice**\nDuring the ice hockey match between the United States and Denmark at the Milan-Cortina 2026 Winter Olympics, spectators in the stands displayed Greenlandic flags as a symbolic protest against Donald Trump's repeated interest in acquiring Greenland, which he has described as 'strategically vital for the U.S. against Russia and China.' The gesture was made by several fans, including Latvians Vita Kalni\u0146a and Alexander Kalnins, who emphasized their European identity and solidarity with Denmark and Greenland. They stated, 'We are Europeans and I believe we must stand united,' and affirmed that Greenland is part of the Danish Realm and should remain so. The U.S. team won the game 6-3, with goals from Tkachuk, Eichel, Hanifin, Guentzel, Hughes, and Boldy. Despite the political tensions, players on the ice maintained sportsmanship, and Danish officials downplayed any direct connection between the game and the Greenland sovereignty issue. Both Danish and Greenlandic authorities firmly reject any transfer of sovereignty, with Greenland's Prime Minister noting that the territory has only recently felt threatened due to Trump\u2019s persistent remarks. In response to geopolitical concerns, NATO launched the 'Arctic Sentry' mission to strengthen security in the Arctic region.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 12:05 PM\nSource:[MARCA](https://www.marca.com/juegos-olimpicos/2026/02/15/groenlandia-desafia-trump-hielo-olimpico.html)\n\n**Danish PM: 'Absolutely Not' \u2014 Rejects Trump\u2019s Greenland Interest, Upholds Sovereignty**\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stated that U.S. President Donald Trump's interest in Greenland has not diminished, despite reduced likelihood of conflict among NATO allies over the Arctic island, which is part of the Danish Realm. Speaking at a panel discussion during the Munich Security Conference, she said, 'I believe the American president's desire has not wavered. He is very serious about this.' When asked if Denmark would sell Greenland to Trump at a certain price, Frederiksen firmly replied, 'Of course not. Can you put a price on a part of Spain? Or a part of the United States?' She emphasized the need to protect sovereignty and the right of self-determination, noting that the people of Greenland have clearly expressed their unwillingness to become American.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 08:29 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20260215/49253938.html)\n\n**Danes Prime Minister Says Trump's Desire to Acquire Greenland Remains Unchanged**\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stated on Saturday, February 14, 2026, during the Munich Security Conference (CSM), that former U.S. President Donald Trump's desire to acquire Greenland remains unchanged and that Trump is 'very serious' about the issue. She emphasized that sovereign states must be protected and that the right to self-determination of peoples must be upheld, noting that Greenlanders have clearly stated they do not wish to become American. A trilateral working group comprising the United States, Denmark, and Greenland has been established to address U.S. security concerns in the Arctic. Frederiksen acknowledged the group as a positive development, saying, 'We will try to see if we can find a solution... But, of course, there are red lines that will not be crossed, and we will stick to our strategy.' Concerns about a potential military takeover of Greenland by the U.S. have diminished following Trump's recent statement in Davos, Switzerland, where he ruled out using military force to seize the island. Additionally, Trump announced he would not impose new tariffs on eight European countries over Greenland after meeting with NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte. Greenland, the world's largest island, is an autonomous territory within the Kingdom of Denmark, with Copenhagen retaining control over defense and foreign policy. Since returning to power in 2025, Trump has repeatedly expressed his desire to 'acquire' Greenland, a move that has drawn widespread rejection across Europe.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 08:10 AM\nSource:[\u65b0\u534e\u7f51](http://spanish.xinhuanet.com/20260215/c53e41614c594077b943baf5e2530ea6/c.html)\n\n**'Such pressure is unacceptable.' Trump still wants Greenland \u2014 Danish PM**\nDanish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen stated that former U.S. President Donald Trump still seeks to acquire Greenland, a position she described as unacceptable due to the pressure it places on Greenland's population, who have never previously faced such threats. Frederiksen emphasized that Denmark will not compromise on sovereignty and territorial integrity, though she acknowledged room for discussion on other issues, such as renegotiating the 1951 defense agreement with the U.S., which she called overly favorable to America. She noted that Denmark has established a working group to explore potential solutions, while maintaining clear red lines. Frederiksen expressed satisfaction with NATO\u2019s growing structured approach to Arctic security and advocated for a permanent presence in Greenland and surrounding regions. Trump has repeatedly expressed interest in purchasing Greenland, citing national security concerns related to Russia and China, and even proposed a military invasion. A U.S. congressional bill was introduced in January 2026 to annex Greenland and grant it statehood. In response, Greenland sought support from the UK, and European nations conducted Arctic military exercises. Trump denied plans for forceful acquisition during a Davos speech, asserting that the U.S. wants to protect Greenland. He also claimed in a Fox News interview that negotiations would grant the U.S. full access to deploy defense infrastructure. Despite earlier reports of a planned invasion, Reuters reported on January 26, 2026, that the Trump administration abandoned the invasion plan due to impeachment risks. On January 31, 2026, Trump announced that talks between the U.S. and Denmark were nearing completion, stating that 'all details have been practically agreed upon.'\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 08:00 AM\nSource:[\u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0435 \u0412\u0440\u0435\u043c\u044f](https://nv.ua/world/geopolitics/grenlandiya-daniya-otreagirovala-na-zhelanie-ssha-i-trampa-izmenit-status-ostrova-50583988.html)\n\n**Will the U.S. Acquire Greenland by 2026?

He has also proposed acquiring sovereignty over Greenland, including land with U.S. military bases, but the Greenlandic government rejected the proposal. Although no major developments have occurred recently, prediction markets are betting on whether the U.S. will acquire part of Greenland by 2026. According to data from the U.S. federal-licensed gambling platform Calci, over $7.9 million has been wagered on the contract 'Will the U.S. acquire part of Greenland by 2026?' The market reflects a 20% probability of acquisition, up 2 percentage points, with the outcome determined by whether the U.S. successfully acquires land in Greenland by December 31, 2026. Eighty-one percent of bettors believe the U.S. will not acquire any part of Greenland. Greenland's Minister for Industry, Energy, and Equality, Naja Nathanielsen, stated in January that 'Surrendering sovereignty is not currently on the agenda' in an interview with USA Today. Trump reiterated at the Davos speech that 'No country or group of countries other than the U.S. has a position on Greenland's security.' However, Greenland's leadership has firmly rejected the proposal, with Prime Minister M\u00fate Egede stating, 'We do not want to become American or Danish. We want to remain Greenlanders.'\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 02:15 PM\nSource:[Benzinga Japan](https://www.benzinga.com/content/50500798/2026)\n\n**Will US Acquire Greenland In 2026? Here's What The Prediction Market Thinks**\nAccording to prediction market data from Kalshi, a federally authorized betting platform, there is a 20% probability\u2014up 2 percentage points\u2014that the United States will acquire part of Greenland by December 31, 2026, with over $7.9 million wagered on the contract 'Will the US acquire part of Greenland in 2026?'. The market will resolve to 'Yes' if the U.S. gains any land territory within Greenland by that date. The majority of bettors, 81%, believe the U.S. will not acquire any part of Greenland in 2026. This speculation follows former President Donald Trump's repeated public statements advocating for U.S. control over Greenland, calling it 'imperative' for national and global security, and suggesting the U.S. should gain sovereignty over land hosting U.S. bases in Greenland. These proposals were rejected by Greenland\u2019s government, with Minister Naaja Nathanielsen stating, 'Giving up sovereignty is not on the table for now,' and Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen asserting, 'We don\u2019t want to be Americans, we don\u2019t want to be Danes, we want to be Greenlanders.'

Trump had threatened to impose new tariffs on these nations for opposing U.S. control over Greenland, with a 10% tariff set to take effect on February 1, 2026, potentially rising to 25% by June 1, 2026. The countries emphasized that their military deployment to Greenland, alongside Slovenia, as part of the Danish-led Arctic Endurance exercise under NATO, is not a threat but a measure to strengthen Arctic security. In a joint statement, they affirmed their commitment to sovereignty and territorial integrity, stating that Trump\u2019s intimidation tactics harm transatlantic relations and risk triggering a dangerous downward spiral. Greenland, a self-governing territory under Danish sovereignty, is strategically located in the Arctic and has a population of approximately 50,000.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 18, 2026 03:41 PM\nSource:[Ag\u00eancia Brasil](https://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/internacional/noticia/2026-01/europeus-ameacados-por-eua-dizem-que-continuarao-unidos-por-soberania)\n\n**Fictional Prediction in *Foreign Affairs*: Trump 'Secures' Greenland Without Bloodshed**\nThe article is a fictional speculative piece published by *Foreign Affairs* on January 12, 2024, titled 'How Greenland Fell' by Jeremy Shapiro, depicting a hypothetical scenario in which Donald Trump, during his second term, secures de facto control over Greenland without military invasion, purchase, or referendum. The piece outlines a 21st-century model of 'geo-osmosis'\u2014a non-traditional, soft territorial expansion through functional penetration via infrastructure investment, contractors, legal gray zones, and strategic dependency. In this scenario, the U.S. government channels $1 billion in 'strategic development' funds through allied NGOs, consulting firms, and disaster response teams, targeting isolated communities in Greenland. These efforts, while appearing humanitarian, create economic dependency and shift political allegiance. Over time, U.S. influence reshapes governance: Danish supply lines are disrupted, local officials are courted, media is influenced, and a pro-American 'Sovereignty Future Caucus' emerges. By 2027, Greenland is in a 'sovereignty twilight'\u2014formally part of Denmark but functionally dependent on the U.S. The U.S. avoids a referendum, instead leveraging a 'temporary autonomy' declaration and a letter from pro-American officials to justify deploying military forces. The U.S. then negotiates a free association agreement, assuming full defense and security, and declares Greenland a 'special economic zone.' Denmark and the EU condemn the move, but lack the leverage to act. The piece concludes that the scenario exemplifies a new era of sovereignty where control is achieved not through force but through systemic dependency, with long-term implications for international law and the erosion of self-determination. The article explicitly states this is speculative fiction intended to provoke reflection and prevent such outcomes.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 17, 2026 04:01 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8pz5V6pgEFu)\n\n**Prediction markets are warping future expectations**\nTraders have wagered over $5 million on the Polymarket prediction platform on whether the United States will acquire sovereignty over Greenland by the end of 2026, with current odds standing at 18%. The article, authored by James David Spellman, principal of Strategic Communications, a Washington-based consulting firm, highlights how prediction markets are increasingly influencing public expectations about future geopolitical events. The topic reflects growing speculative interest in a scenario that remains highly unlikely under current international and political conditions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 08:07 PM\nSource:[Nikkei Asia](https://asia.nikkei.com/opinion/prediction-markets-are-warping-future-expectations)\n\n**Foreign Affairs: The U.S. Could Gain Control of Greenland by 2028, According to a Plausible Scenario**\nAccording to a Foreign Affairs article by Jeremy Shapiro, director of research at the European Council on Foreign Relations (ECFR), a 'plausible but not inevitable' scenario for the 'Americanization' of Greenland could unfold under a second term of U.S. President Donald Trump. The scenario, intended to prevent a catastrophic outcome, envisions the U.S. establishing de facto control over Greenland by 2028 through economic and political influence rather than military force. Shapiro describes this process as 'geo-osmosis'\u2014a 'new form of 21st-century imperialism'\u2014where sovereignty is achieved without violence. The U.S. would launch the 'Northern Strategic Reallocation Initiative' in May 2026, allocating $10 billion to modernize Greenland\u2019s infrastructure and exploit its natural resources. Projects would be carried out by private consortia in exchange for binding local agreements, creating functional dependence on Washington while Greenland formally remains part of Denmark. Although most Greenlanders oppose U.S. annexation, some local politicians may agree due to frustration with Danish paternalism and budget constraints. By October 2027, Greenland\u2019s parliament could declare a temporary autonomy and a 'transitional sovereignty period.' The U.S. would then open military-civilian coordination centers in Nuuk and three other cities, followed by a proposal for a Compact of Free Association (COFA), similar to agreements with Pacific island nations. Denmark would protest, recalling its ambassador to Washington, and the EU would condemn the U.S. for violating international law, though it would take no action beyond monitoring. China and Russia may view the U.S. actions as a precedent. Trump previously expressed interest in purchasing Greenland during his first term, an offer rejected by both Denmark and Greenland, with the latter stating, 'Greenland is not for sale.' After his return to office, Trump reiterated that the U.S. should own Greenland, claiming it is 'surrounded' by Russian and Chinese fleets. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warned that any U.S. attempt to seize Greenland would end NATO.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 02:00 AM\nSource:[EADaily](https://eadaily.com/ru/news/2026/01/13/foreign-affairs-ssha-poluchat-grenlandiyu-k-2028-godu)\n\n**Greenland Rejects U.S. Overtures: Parliament Unites to Declare 'We Want to Remain Greenlanders'**\nGreenland's parliament, Inatsisartut, issued a unified statement on Friday, January 10, 2026, rejecting any possibility of becoming part of the United States or remaining under Danish sovereignty. All five political parties represented in the parliament emphasized that Greenland's future must be determined solely by its own people. The statement, issued collectively by party leaders, declared, 'We do not want to become American, nor Danish. We simply want to remain Greenlanders.' This unified stance comes in response to repeated declarations by former U.S. President Donald Trump, who has consistently expressed a one-sided interest in acquiring Greenland, advocating for its purchase and integration into the United States. The statement reflects a strong national consensus on self-determination and sovereignty.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: January 10, 2026 08:27 AM\nSource:[News18 India](https://hindi.news18.com/world/rest-of-world-greenland-parliament-rejects-donald-trump-claim-future-decision-people-ws-ad-10050896.html)\n\n**Stephen Miller Claims No Country Would Fight the U.S. Over Greenland\u2019s Future**\nStephen Miller, senior advisor to U.S. President Donald Trump, stated in a CNN interview on Monday, January 6, 2026, that no country would militarily challenge the United States over the future of Greenland, a self-governing territory of Denmark. Miller asserted that the U.S. has a 'formal position' that Greenland should become part of the United States, questioning Denmark's right to control the Arctic island and claiming that Greenland's status as a Danish territory lacks a solid legal basis. He emphasized that the U.S., as the dominant power in NATO, must secure the Arctic region for NATO's interests, thereby justifying Greenland's inclusion in the U.S. When asked if military force might be used, Miller said, 'Nobody is going to fight militarily against the U.S. for the future of Greenland.' This statement followed Trump's renewed call for the U.S. to acquire Greenland, citing national security concerns and the presence of Russian and Chinese vessels in the region. In response, leaders from six European nations\u2014Denmark, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and the UK\u2014issued a joint declaration affirming Greenland's sovereignty, stating, 'Greenland belongs to its people,' and emphasizing that only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning them. The Danish Prime Minister, Mette Frederiksen, warned that a U.S. annexation would end the NATO alliance. Greenland's Prime Minister, Jens-Frederik Nielsen, condemned Trump\u2019s 'fantasies of annexation' as 'completely unacceptable.' Greenland has been under Danish control since the 18th century, gained self-rule in 1979, and retains Danish oversight of foreign and security policy. The island is rich in rare earth minerals critical for advanced technologies.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 06, 2026 08:00 PM\nSource:[euronews](http://pt.euronews.com/2026/01/06/stephen-miller-diz-que-ninguem-lutaria-contra-os-eua-pelo-futuro-da-gronelandia)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
