The page displays a prediction market question about Greenland's sovereignty status before 2040.\n\n**Key Information:**\n\n1. **Main Question**: \"Will Greenland be a sovereign state before 2040?\"\n   - Current market probability: 13% chance (based on the title, though the text also shows \"31% chance\")\n   - Market volume: 130\u1e40 to 2602040 (Manifold's play money currency)\n\n2. **Resolution Criteria**:\n   - Resolves YES if Greenland joins the UN as a sovereign state\n   - Resolves YES if Greenland is self-declared sovereign with >90% international recognition\n   - Resolves as a percentage if Greenland is self-declared sovereign with <90% international recognition (based on the percentage of countries recognizing its independence)\n\n3. **Related Market Questions Listed** (with their current probabilities):\n   - Will Greenland become independent from Denmark before 2030? - 20%\n   - Will the US acquire or gain sovereignty over any part of Greenland by March 31, 2026? - 5%\n   - Will Greenland become a member of the EU before 2040? - 41%\n   - Will Greenland become part of the US by the end of Trump's term? - 6%\n   - Will the USA acquire Greenland by Dec. 31 2026? - 7%\n   - Will Greenland enter into a Compact of Free Association (COFA) with the US before 2030? - 26%\n   - Will Greenland leave the Kingdom of Denmark before 2032? - 25%\n\n**Note**: This is a prediction market platform (Manifold) rather than a news source, so these percentages represent aggregated betting positions of market participants rather than expert analysis or polling data.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://sundayguardianlive.com/world/trump-greenland-dream-is-a-chimera-in-a-hypervelocity-age-167534/\">\n## Summary of Article: \"Trump's Greenland dream is a chimera in a Hypervelocity Age\"\n\n**Source:** The Sunday Guardian  \n**Date:** January 31, 2026  \n**Author:** Sumit Kumar\n\n### Key Arguments and Analysis:\n\n**Strategic Critique:**\n- The article argues that Trump's renewed interest in Greenland (articulated from Iceland) reflects outdated 20th-century strategic thinking that equates territorial control with security\n- The author contends that in the modern \"Hypervelocity Age\" characterized by hypersonic weapons, compressed decision cycles, cognitive warfare, and climate stress, geography alone no longer delivers assumed security outcomes\n- Fixed geography and territorial buffers that provided strategic advantage during the Cold War now offer only \"marginal advantage against multidirectional threats\"\n- Modern security flows more from \"resilience: dispersion of assets, redundancy of systems, technological adaptability and\u2014critically\u2014cognitive preparedness\" rather than territorial possession\n\n**Legal and Legitimacy Concerns:**\n- Any coercive move against Greenland would violate core principles of sovereignty and territorial integrity enshrined in the UN Charter\n- Such actions would undermine the post-1945 international legal order and normalize grey-zone behavior\n- The author warns this could \"lower thresholds for escalation and accelerate militarisation\"\n\n**Alliance and Geopolitical Implications:**\n- A coercive move would strain EU and NATO unity, as Greenland is inseparable from Denmark, a NATO ally\n- Could undermine NATO's moral center and trust among smaller members\n- Russia would likely accelerate Arctic militarization in response\n- China's official response has emphasized respect for territorial integrity while positioning itself as a \"near-Arctic state\" engaged in scientific cooperation\n\n**Arctic Environmental Concerns:**\n- The Arctic is warming at nearly three times the global average\n- The region faces \"grey rhino\" risks including methane release, permafrost degradation, and cascading climate disruptions\n- Militarizing the Arctic under these conditions is described as \"strategically myopic\"\n- The Arctic has been governed through cooperation via institutions like the Arctic Council; undermining this framework would signal retreat from multilateralism\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe author argues that Greenland represents \"a test of strategic maturity\" rather than a strategic prize, suggesting that true 21st-century power lies in governance, restraint, and wisdom rather than territorial domination.\n\n**Note:** This is an opinion piece presenting strategic analysis rather than reporting factual developments about U.S. acquisition efforts.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/1/22/trumps-greenland-pact-will-demand-allies-boost-arctic-security-nato-chief\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Greenland and Denmark say sovereignty 'red line' after latest Trump remarks\"\n\n**Source:** Al Jazeera (by News Agencies)\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**Statements on Sovereignty:**\n- Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen stated that sovereignty is a \"red line\" that cannot be crossed, emphasizing the need to respect territorial integrity and international law\n- Nielsen said he doesn't know what's in the agreement/deal about Greenland reached between Trump and NATO chief Mark Rutte\n- Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen also said discussions about Denmark's sovereignty are off the table and \"cannot be changed\"\n\n**Trump's Claims:**\n- Trump claimed to have secured \"total access\" to Greenland under a framework agreed with NATO chief Mark Rutte\n- In a Fox Business Network interview at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Trump said the framework would give the US \"total access\" with \"no end, there's no time limit\"\n- Trump stated \"It's really being negotiated now, the details of it\"\n- Trump dropped his threat to impose 10% tariffs on European countries opposed to his Greenland bid and ruled out the use of force\n\n**NATO and Security Framework:**\n- NATO chief Mark Rutte told Reuters the framework agreement would require NATO countries to swiftly ramp up security efforts in the Arctic to ward off threats from Russia and China\n- Rutte said he hopes this can be done \"quite fast,\" ideally early in 2026\n- NATO spokesperson Allison Hart clarified that Rutte \"did not propose any compromise to sovereignty during his meeting with President Trump\"\n- Mineral exploitation on Greenland was not discussed in the Trump-Rutte meeting, according to Rutte\n\n**Other Elements:**\n- Trump mentioned a \"Golden Dome\" missile defense program (a $175 billion system that would put US weapons in space for the first time)\n- Denmark is open to discussing a 1951 pact with the US, \"but it has to be in the framework of us as a sovereign state,\" according to Frederiksen\n- German Chancellor Friedrich Merz welcomed Trump's U-turn on Greenland and urged Europeans not to write off the transatlantic partnership too quickly\n\n**Context:**\n- The article notes Trump has ramped up threats to seize Greenland in recent weeks, claiming it's needed for US national security and to prevent Chinese or Russian inroads in the Arctic\n- The push has \"plunged US-European relations to their lowest point in decades and prompted fears for the survival of NATO\"\n- European governments remain wary of another change of mind by Trump, who \"is increasingly seen as a bully that Europe needs to stand up to,\" according to observers\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://myind.net/Home/viewArticle/annexing-greenland-with-americanese-characteristics\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Annexing Greenland with 'Americanese' Characteristics\"\n\n**Source:** MyIndMakers Staff\n\n## Key Facts and Context:\n\n**Historical Background:**\n- U.S. interest in Greenland dates to the 19th century when Secretary of State William H. Seward considered acquiring Greenland and Iceland, similar to the Alaska Purchase\n- In 1867, the U.S. commissioned surveys for economic and strategic benefits; Denmark rejected these overtures\n- During WWII (1941), the U.S. signed a Defence of Greenland agreement\n- Since 1951, the U.S. has maintained bases, notably Thule Air Base (now Pituffik Space Base), under bilateral accords with Denmark\n\n**Current Situation (2026):**\n- Since the beginning of 2026, President Trump has made repeated statements about acquiring Greenland \"by any means\" for national security reasons\n- Greenland has approximately 57,000 residents, predominantly Inuit\n- Greenland is an autonomous, self-governing island within the Kingdom of Denmark\n\n**Responses to U.S. Claims:**\n- Denmark's government stated \"you cannot annex another country\"\n- Greenland's premier denied any deal to surrender sovereignty\n- Leaders of Greenland's parliamentary parties jointly condemned U.S. annexation plans\n- Large-scale protests occurring in both Greenland and Denmark with slogans like \"Greenland is not for sale\"\n- Allied nations warned against undermining NATO unity\n\n**Strategic Importance Cited:**\n- Arctic geopolitics amid rising Russian and Chinese activity\n- Location between Iceland and the UK serves as corridor for naval/air operations\n- Missile defense and space bases for early warning systems\n- Rare earth and critical minerals resources\n\n**Broader U.S. Territorial Ambitions Mentioned:**\n- The current administration has also discussed acquiring Canada as the 51st state, renaming the Gulf of Mexico, and reclaiming control of the Panama Canal\n\n**Opinion (Named Source):**\n- Senator Lindsey Graham reinforced acquisitive stance with statement: \"Who gives a s*** who owns Greenland?\"\n\n**Current Status:**\n- Reports indicate ongoing talks between U.S. and Denmark about expanded military access agreements\n- Article notes full annexation \"remains out of reach under existing international law\"\n\n**Article's Perspective (Opinion - MyIndMakers Staff):**\nThe article presents a critical view of U.S. actions, characterizing them as \"imperial impulses\" and \"naked expansionist ambitions\" disguised as responses to Chinese and Russian threats. It emphasizes the clash between U.S. expansionist ideology and Greenlandic self-determination.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2026/02/14/denmark-greenland-trump-munich-security-conference/88681038007/\">\n# Summary of USA TODAY Article on Denmark, Greenland, and Trump's Interest\n\n**Date of Article:** February 14, 2026 (statements made at Munich Security Conference)\n\n## Key Facts and Statements:\n\n### Leadership Positions on Trump's Intentions:\n- **Mette Frederiksen** (Denmark's Prime Minister) and **Jens-Frederik Nielsen** (Greenland's Prime Minister) stated at the Munich Security Conference that President Trump is \"very serious\" about acquiring Greenland\n- Frederiksen: \"I think the desire from the U.S. president is exactly the same\"\n- Nielsen: Trump's desire to acquire Greenland is \"still there\" and they \"cannot lower our shoulders\"\n- Frederiksen concluded: \"We don't think it's over\"\n\n### Status of Talks:\n- The United States, Denmark, and Greenland launched talks in late January 2026 to resolve the diplomatic crisis\n- Both leaders said they held \"constructive talks\" with Secretary of State Marco Rubio at the conference\n- Virtually no details about the discussions have been made public beyond Trump's statement at the World Economic Forum last month\n- Trump stated a \"framework of a future deal with respect to Greenland\" had been reached\n- This announcement appeared to catch Denmark and Greenland by surprise\n- NATO Secretary General Mark Rutte clarified he did not discuss Greenland's sovereignty with Trump\n\n### Greenlandic Public Opinion:\n- Polls show Greenlandic people want to eventually become independent of Denmark but have no interest in becoming American\n- Nielsen stated this is the first time Greenlandic people \"feel unsafe for real\" and it's \"with an ally who is talking about acquiring them, buying them and so on. It's outrageous.\"\n\n### Negotiation Parameters:\n- Frederiksen said Denmark is willing to work with the Trump administration but \"there are of course things you cannot compromise on,\" specifically naming sovereignty and territorial integrity\n- A senior Greenlandic official previously told USA TODAY that U.S. ownership of American military bases in Greenland is a \"red line\"\n- Frederiksen suggested revising a 1951 defense agreement offers a \"very easy\" way for the U.S. to \"have a stronger footprint in Greenland\"\n\n### NATO Response:\n- NATO announced on February 11, 2026 that it launched a mission to strengthen its presence in the Arctic to defuse tensions within the alliance\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide daily history of the community prediction for Metaculus question 41502 through 2026-02-17, highlight major jumps, and list contemporaneous news events about U.S. moves toward acquiring Greenland.\n1.  Available evidence on daily community-prediction history  \n\u2003\u2022 None of the articles or forum posts returned in the searches contains a day-by-day numerical record for Metaculus question 41502.  \n\u2003\u2022 No snapshots from the Metaculus website itself (e.g., via the public API or the Wayback Machine) were captured in the results set.  \n\u2003\u2022 Therefore we cannot now reconstruct a table of the community prediction from launch through 2026-02-17, nor can we quantify when the probability crossed particular thresholds or jumped by specific percentage points.  \n\u2003\u2022 Because those numbers are essential to answering \u201cWill the community prediction be higher than 6 % on 2026-02-28?\u201d, a direct scrape of Metaculus or an archive source is still required.\n\n2.  Major qualitative events likely to have moved the forecast  \nAlthough we do not yet have the numeric forecast series, the news record shows several clear catalysts that plausibly produced upward spikes in community probability.  Chronologically:  \n\u2003\u2022 7 Jan 2026 \u2013 White House confirms \u201cmilitary force is always an option\u201d for taking Greenland (BBC; Al Jazeera; MS NOW).  This is the first explicit threat in the new term and would reasonably push the forecast up from its long-run ~3 \u2013 4 % baseline.  \n\u2003\u2022 8 Jan 2026 \u2013 Danish and Greenlandic envoys rush to Washington to lobby against a \u201ctakeover\u201d (Boston Herald).  \n\u2003\u2022 14 Jan 2026 \u2013 High-level summit at the White House with Danish, Greenlandic and U.S. officials (BBC 14 Jan 2026).  President Trump again states he wants the territory \u201cthe easy way or the hard way.\u201d  \n\u2003\u2022 19 Jan 2026 \u2013 Rep. Randy Fine files the \u201cGreenland Annexation and Statehood Act,\u201d granting congressional authority for annexation by \u201cany means necessary\u201d (WNDB 19 Jan 2026).  \n\u2003\u2022 21 Jan 2026 \u2013 CNN publishes constitutional analysis: how the U.S. could legally acquire Greenland (CNN 21 Jan 2026).  \n\u2003\u2022 7 Feb 2026 \u2013 NATO announces \u201cArctic Sentry\u201d mission to reassure allies (quoted in several stories).  \n\u2003\u2022 11 Feb 2026 \u2013 Trump says \u201cwe\u2019re negotiating right now for Greenland,\u201d signalling ongoing talks (Al Jazeera 14 Feb 2026).  \n\u2003\u2022 14 Feb 2026 \u2013 Munich Security Conference: Danish and Greenlandic leaders concede Trump is \u201cvery serious\u201d about acquisition; Secretary of State Rubio meets them but gives no assurances (Al Jazeera & USA Today, both 14 Feb 2026).  \n\n   Each of these items represents new U.S. governmental steps (legislative proposals, diplomatic meetings, public threats) that forecasters typically treat as evidence the probability should rise; they are prime candidates for \u201cmajor jumps\u201d once the numerical series is obtained.\n\n3.  Contemporaneous news events summarised  \n\u2003\u2022 Military option explicitly on the table (BBC, Al Jazeera, MS NOW \u2013 7 Jan 2026).  \n\u2003\u2022 Intensive diplomatic lobbying by Denmark & Greenland in Washington (Boston Herald \u2013 8 Jan 2026).  \n\u2003\u2022 White House summit including VP Vance and SecState Rubio; Trump re-asserts intent (BBC \u2013 14 Jan 2026).  \n\u2003\u2022 Greenland Annexation and Statehood Act introduced in House (WNDB \u2013 19 Jan 2026).  \n\u2003\u2022 Multiple congressional Republican bills (\u201cMake Greenland Great Again Act,\u201d \u201cRed, White & Blueland Act\u201d) seek to fast-track annexation (NPR 12 Feb 2025; Fulcrum 21 Feb 2025; WNDB 19 Jan 2026).  \n\u2003\u2022 CNN constitutional analysis outlines possible legal pathways (CNN \u2013 21 Jan 2026).  \n\u2003\u2022 European & NATO allies issue joint statements backing Danish sovereignty; NATO rolls out \u201cArctic Sentry\u201d patrols (BBC 7 Jan 2026; Al Jazeera 14 Feb 2026).  \n\u2003\u2022 Munich Security Conference underscores the crisis; Rubio, Frederiksen, Nielsen all confirm talks continue but risk remains (Al Jazeera & USA Today 14 Feb 2026).\n\n4.
