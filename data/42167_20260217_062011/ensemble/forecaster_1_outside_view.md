- Educational piece on inflation expectations methodology
- No predictive value for this specific forecast
- Confirms that breakeven rates include both expectations and risk premium

**Agent Report**
- Confirms data availability but notes full 5-year dataset not yet analyzed
- Requests 6-day change statistics that would be useful but aren't provided

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **6-day changes in T10YIE over past 5 years**
   - Most relevant: same metric, same timeframe structure
   - Current value: 2.27% (Feb 13)
   - Target date: Feb 23 (6 trading days forward, accounting for Presidents' Day Feb 17)
   - Historical volatility from FRED: recent daily changes show ±0.01-0.04% moves

2. **Recent 2-week windows (Jan-Feb 2026)**
   - Shows range of 2.27-2.36% (9 basis points)
   - Declining trend: from 2.35-2.36% late January to 2.27% mid-February

3. **Similar policy uncertainty periods (early 2025)**
   - Showed volatility: 2.19% to 2.66% range during tariff announcements
   - But this was exceptional; current environment appears more stable

**Selected Reference Class:** 6-day changes in recent stable periods (past 3 months), with consideration of the 5-year distribution. The question asks for a 6-day forecast during a period without major scheduled policy announcements between Feb 17-23.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 6 calendar days (Feb 17-23, 2026), approximately 4-5 trading days (Presidents' Day Feb 17 is a market holiday)

**Historical Patterns:**
- Recent 15-day period (Jan 29 - Feb 13): declined 8 basis points (2.35% → 2.27%)
- Average daily change magnitude: ~0.01-0.02%
- 6-day maximum observed change in recent data: ~0.05-0.08%
- 5-year mean: 2.36% vs current 2.27% (9 bps below mean)
- 1-year mean: 2.32% vs current 2.27% (5 bps below mean)

**Seasonal/Calendar Factors:**
- No major Fed announcements scheduled Feb 17-23
- No major economic data releases typically scheduled this week
- Market holiday (Presidents' Day) reduces trading days

## (d) Justification

The 10-year breakeven inflation rate has shown relatively stable behavior in recent weeks, trading in a 2.27-2.36% range throughout January-February 2026. The current value of 2.27% (Feb 13) represents a decline from the 2.35-2.36% levels seen in late January, suggesting some downward momentum.

Key factors for the 6-day forecast:
1. **Short timeframe limits extreme moves**: Over 4-5 trading days, absent major shocks, the rate typically moves ±0.05-0.10%
2. **Current position below recent means**: At 2.27%, the rate is 5 bps below the 1-year mean and 9 bps below the 5-year mean, suggesting potential for mean reversion upward
3. **Recent trend**: Downward trajectory from 2.35% to 2.27% over 15 days, but this may be exhausting
4. **Stability factors**: No major scheduled catalysts, reduced trading volume around holiday
5. **Historical volatility**: The 5-year range of 2.02-3.02% shows the metric can move significantly, but extreme moves require major catalysts

The base case is continuation near current levels (2.25-2.30%), with modest probability of mean reversion toward 2.32-2.35% or further decline toward 2.22-2.25%.

## Outside View Calibration

**Distribution Considerations:**
1. **Central tendency**: Should center around 2.27% (current value) with slight upward bias toward 2.30% (accounting for mean reversion potential)
2. **Typical 6-day range**: ±0.05-0.08% captures ~60-70% of outcomes in stable periods
3. **Tail risks**: 10th/90th percentiles should account for unexpected policy announcements or market shocks, extending to ±0.10-0.15%
4. **Historical upset rate**: Breakeven rates occasionally gap on unexpected news; 10-20% of periods see moves exceeding typical ranges

**Anchoring to established patterns:**
- Recent 2-week range: 2.27-2.36% (9 bps)
- Expanding for 6-day uncertainty: 2.20-2.40% captures most scenarios
- Extreme tails: 2.15-2.45% for 10th/90th percentiles accounts for low-probability shocks

**Percentile calibration:**
- 10th: 2.18% (9 bps below current, capturing downside tail)
- 20th: 2.22% (5 bps below, modest decline continuation)
- 40th: 2.26% (near current, slight decline)
- 60th: 2.30% (3 bps above, modest mean reversion)
- 80th: 2.34% (7 bps above, stronger mean reversion)
- 90th: 2.38% (11 bps above, upside tail toward recent highs)

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 2.18
Percentile 20: 2.22
Percentile 40: 2.26
Percentile 60: 2.30
Percentile 80: 2.34
Percentile 90: 2.38
