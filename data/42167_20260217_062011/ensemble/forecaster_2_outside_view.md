**Agent Report:**
- Confirms need for 5-year daily data to calculate 6-day change statistics
- Notes data availability but lacks complete calculations
- Procedural analysis, not predictive

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **6-day changes in T10YIE over past 5 years:** Most directly relevant - captures typical volatility over the exact timeframe we're forecasting (6 trading days from Feb 13 to Feb 23, 2026)

2. **Recent 30-day movements (Jan-Feb 2026):** Shows current regime with values 2.22%-2.36%, mean around 2.32%

3. **1-year historical range:** Mean 2.32%, range 2.17%-2.45% - captures recent market conditions

4. **5-year historical range:** Mean 2.36%, range 2.02%-3.02% - broader context but includes COVID and inflation spike periods

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** The 1-year and recent 30-day movements are most appropriate because:
- Market conditions have stabilized post-inflation spike
- Recent data shows tight clustering around 2.27%-2.36%
- 6 trading days is short enough that structural regime changes are unlikely
- Current value (2.27%) is near recent lows

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 6 trading days (Feb 17-23, 2026)

**Recent Pattern Analysis:**
- Last 12 daily observations (Jan 29 - Feb 13): range 2.27%-2.36%
- Recent trend: declining from 2.36% (early Feb) to 2.27% (Feb 13)
- Daily volatility appears modest: typical moves of 0.01-0.03%
- No weekend data (series is trading days only)

**Historical 6-day Movement Patterns:**
From FRED statistics:
- 1-month change: -0.02 (-0.9%)
- Over ~20 trading days, movement was -0.02%
- This suggests 6-day movements are typically small, likely ±0.05% range

**Seasonal/Calendar Considerations:**
- No major Fed announcements scheduled for this week
- Mid-month period (less volatile than month-end)
- No obvious catalysts for large moves

## (d) Justification

The 10-year breakeven inflation rate has shown remarkable stability in recent weeks, trading in a tight 2.27%-2.36% range. The current value of 2.27% (Feb 13) represents the recent low end of this range.

Key factors supporting stability:
1. **Short timeframe:** 6 trading days provides limited time for major regime shifts
2. **Recent volatility:** Daily moves typically 0.01-0.03%, suggesting 6-day cumulative moves rarely exceed 0.10%
3. **Market anchoring:** Despite tariff concerns mentioned in historical sources, breakeven rates have remained well-anchored around 2.3%
4. **Mean reversion tendency:** Current value at recent low (2.27%) may see modest reversion toward recent mean (2.32%)

Risks to consider:
- Unexpected policy announcements
- Major economic data releases
- Market shocks (though none anticipated)
- The rate could continue declining if deflationary tariff effects materialize

Given the 1-year mean of 2.32% and recent range of 2.22%-2.45%, I expect the Feb 23 value to remain within 2.20%-2.40% with high confidence, centered slightly above the current 2.27% due to mean reversion.

## Outside View Calibration

**Anchoring to Historical Distributions:**
- Recent 30-day range: 2.22%-2.36% (14 basis points)
- 1-year range: 2.17%-2.45% (28 basis points)
- Current value: 2.27%

**Volatility Considerations:**
For a 6-day horizon with typical daily moves of 0.01-0.03%:
- Expected cumulative move: ±0.03-0.08%
- 80% confidence interval: approximately ±0.10%
- 90% confidence interval: approximately ±0.15%

**Distribution Shape:**
- Central tendency: 2.27-2.33% (current value to recent mean)
- Slight positive skew due to mean reversion from recent low
- Fat tails to account for unexpected shocks (10-20% probability of moves >0.10%)

**Percentile Calibration:**
- 10th percentile: Should capture downside tail (~1.5 std dev below center)
- 50th percentile: Slightly above current value (2.29-2.30%)
- 90th percentile: Should capture upside tail (~1.5 std dev above center)

Given current value of 2.27% and expecting modest mean reversion with typical volatility:
- Center estimate: 2.29%
- Standard deviation estimate: ~0.05%
- Range for 80% confidence: 2.22%-2.36%
- Range for 90% confidence: 2.18%-2.40%

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 2.18
Percentile 20: 2.22
Percentile 40: 2.27
Percentile 60: 2.31
Percentile 80: 2.35
Percentile 90: 2.40
