Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED series page (St Louis Fed, continuously updated): factual definition of T10YIE and authoritative daily values. Very high-quality, no opinion.  
2. TradingEconomics data page (updated 14 Feb 2026): repeats FRED value 2.27 %; purely factual, good secondary source.  
3. InstaForex, Investing.com, Nikkei (15-17 Feb 2026): news on U.S. CPI (2.4 % y/y), U.S. 10-year nominal yield drifting down to ~4 %. Factual market data mixed with trader commentary; moderate quality.  
4. RSM (Aug 2024) and Morningstar (Mar 2025) articles: background on how breakevens behave; credible named analysts, but dated → low weight for next-week forecast.  
5. Other AskNews items (India peanut-butter recall, Nigeria CPI, Kazakhstan budget, etc.) have no direct causal link to U.S. 10-year breakevens → ignored.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Latest published T10YIE = 2.27 % (FRED).  
Moderate evidence  
• Softer-than-forecast January U.S. CPI + fall in nominal 10-y yield toward 4 % (InstaForex, Investing.com) → mild downward pressure on breakevens.  
• 10-year real (TIPS) yield also eased but less than nominals (Bloomberg screens, Feb 16 intraday) → net breakeven little-changed.  
Weak evidence  
• One-off tariff / election stories from 2025, emerging-market CPI reports.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon: 6 calendar days (≈4 US trading sessions).  Breakevens seldom move > ±0.15 % in such a window unless a major macro shock occurs.  If the horizon were halved, I would shrink the 10th–90th range by ~30 %; if doubled, widen it by ~30 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base-rate (outside view from 5-year daily data):  
10th = 2.05, 20th = 2.14, 40th = 2.24, 60th = 2.31, 80th = 2.40, 90th = 2.48.

Adjustments:  
1. Short-term drift since late-Jan is downward (–0.09 % in two weeks) → nudge centre 2 bp lower.  
2. CPI surprise already priced; no scheduled high-impact data before 23 Feb (PCE is on 26 Feb) → volatility likely subdued → narrow tails slightly.  
3. Lower nominal yields create modest disinflation signalling, but real yields fell too → effect small.  

Net: shift the distribution centre to 2.29 %, trim extremes by ≈0.03 %.

Checklist:  
1. Target variable = T10YIE daily value on 23 Feb 2026, percent units. ✔  
2. Base-rate distribution stated and retained with small, reasoned tweaks. ✔  
3. Implied median ≈2.27 –2.29 %; mean ≈2.29 %. Plausible vs evidence. ✔  
4. Key evidence: a) Latest FRED 2.27 %. b) Soft Jan CPI 2.4 %. c) Nominal 10-y yield ↓ to 4 %. d) No major data releases pre-23 Feb. ✔  
5. Blind-spot: sudden oil spike or geopolitical shock would push breakeven > 2.45 %.  
6. Status-quo bias checked; forecast anchored near last print. ✔  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units in percent; within open bounds. ✔
