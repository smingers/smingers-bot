Analysis:
a) Source analysis (key items)

1. FRED series T10YIE (data to 13 Feb 2026, value = 2.27 %).  Primary, official, daily; pure fact.
2. TradingEconomics mirror (14 Feb 2026 page still shows 2.27 %).  High-quality, confirms FRED.
3. InstaForex 17 Feb 2026 – “US 10-year yield drops toward 4 % after soft CPI”.  Reliable headline data on nominal yields; factual move confirmed by Bloomberg.  Indicates lower inflation concerns.
4. Investing.com ZA 16 Feb 2026 – notes January CPI 2.4 % YoY, 10-year yield 4.07 %.  Same information, different outlet; corroborative.
5. Economic-Times 12 Dec 2025 – quotes 10-yr TIPS breakeven 2.272 %.  Older but shows breakeven reverts quickly after macro shocks.
6. Other news (peanut-butter recall, Nigeria CPI, etc.) lack direct causal link to US breakevens – ignored.

b) Evidence analysis  
• Soft January-26 CPI surprise: two independent high-quality sources, clear mechanism (lower expected inflation) → Moderate to strong downward pressure (Moderate/Strong).  
• 10-yr nominal yield fell ~15 bp since 12 Feb; real yield likely fell less (historical pattern) → Moderate downward pressure (Moderate).  
• No scheduled high-impact data before 23 Feb except FOMC minutes (usually low effect) → Moderate evidence for low volatility (Moderate).  
• Six-day empirical σ ≈ 0.04 pp since 2019, structural mean-reversion to ~2 ¼ % (Strong).  
• Holiday-shortened week may add noise but historically not > ±0.02 pp (Weak).

c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in 6 calendar days ≈ 5 trading days.  If horizon halved (≈3 days) σ would fall to ~0.03 pp; if doubled (≈12 days) σ rises to ~0.06 pp and small drift toward 2.20–2.25 % would strengthen.

d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside view: Normal(μ = 2.27 %, σ = 0.05 %).  
Inside information (soft CPI, falling nominal yields, lack of upside catalysts) nudges expectation ~-0.02 pp.  Vol-assumption unchanged.  Resulting inside view centre 2.25 %, σ 0.045 %.

Checklist:
1. Target: closing FRED value (percent) for T10YIE on 23 Feb 2026. ✔  
2. Outside view quoted above. ✔  
3. Implied median ≈ 2.25 %, mean ≈ 2.25 %; consistent with rationale. ✔  
4. Key evidence: a) soft Jan-CPI; b) 10-yr yield ↓ to 4 %; c) no major data before 23 Feb; d) historical σ ≈ 0.04 pp. ✔  
5. Blind-spot: unexpected surge in commodity prices/Fed rhetoric raising inflation break-evens > 2.35 % (would push outcome up).  
6. Status-quo bias checked – distribution still centred near last print.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, correct units, within open bounds. ✔
