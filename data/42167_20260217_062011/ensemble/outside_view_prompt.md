You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
What will be the value of "10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate" on 2026-02-23?

Question background:
The Federal Reserve Economic Data database (FRED) provides economic data from national, international, public, and private sources. The series T10YIE is a dataset that is tracked by the FRED API. It represents the US' 10-year breakeven inflation rate. The title of the series is "10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate". The last data point on the graph (as of creation of this question) is from 2026-02-13 and has a value of 2.27. The units of the series are "Percent". The update frequency of the series is "Daily". The seasonal adjustment of the series is "Not Seasonally Adjusted". An interactive graph for the series can be found [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10YIE). Below are the notes attached to the series:

> The breakeven inflation rate represents a measure of expected inflation derived from 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Securities (DGS10 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10)) and 10-Year Treasury Inflation-Indexed Constant Maturity Securities (DFII10 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII10)). The latest value implies what market participants expect inflation to be in the next 10 years, on average.
> Starting with the update on June 21, 2019, the Treasury bond data used in calculating interest rate spreads is obtained directly from the U.S. Treasury Department (https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield).

## Summary of Article: "BTC Price Rally Ahead? Key Markets Indicate Trump Tariffs Could Bring Down Inflation, Challenging Fed's Stagflation Fears"

**Source:** Coindesk

### Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Bitcoin Performance:** Bitcoin has dropped nearly 20% since early February amid broad-based risk aversion.

2. **Tariff Escalation:** As of writing, the U.S. and China have imposed retaliatory tariffs on each other in excess of 100%.

3. **Timeline:** President Trump promised tariffs in his inaugural address on Jan. 20, and fired the first shot against China, Canada and Mexico on Feb. 1.

4. **Inflation Breakeven Rates:**
   - The 5-year breakeven inflation rate peaked above 2.6% in early February and has since dropped to 2.32% (according to Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis data)
   - The 10-year breakeven rate has dropped from 2.5% to 2.19%
   - The Federal Reserve Bank of Cleveland's expected two-year inflation has held at around 2.6%

### Key Arguments/Opinions:

**From the article's analysis:**
- Despite fears of stagflation, market indicators suggest Trump's tariffs may lead to lower inflation in the long term, potentially allowing the Federal Reserve to cut rates
- Historical and recent analysis indicate that tariffs tend to be disinflationary in advanced economies as they can lead to reduced consumer spending and lower prices
- The article suggests the Fed might be wrong in fearing stagflation and will soon have leeway to cut rates

**Named source - Jim Paulsen (author of the Paulsen Perspectives):**
- "Since the days of Smoot-Hawley, Tariffs have never been inflationary. Rather they are Deflationary and 'stimulative themselves'"
- "Moreover, the disinflation shown in these charts will help encourage the Fed to soon ease as well. The Calvary is coming!"

**Mechanism described:**
- Tariffs are viewed as a one-time cost adjustment
- When producers pass tariff increases to consumers without corresponding income increases, consumers reduce consumption, leading to inventory build-up and ultimately declining prices

# Summary of "Understanding Inflation Expectations and Their Importance"

**Source:** Brookings  
**Date:** January 23, 2020  
**Author:** Christina D. Romer

## Key Facts and Concepts:

### Definition and Mechanism:
- Inflation expectations are the rate at which consumers, businesses, and investors expect prices to rise in the future
- Actual inflation depends partly on expected inflation: if everyone expects 3% inflation, businesses will raise prices by at least 3%, and workers will demand similar wage increases
- If inflation expectations rise by one percentage point, actual inflation will tend to rise by one percentage point as well

### Federal Reserve's Role:
- The Fed's mandate includes price stability, defined as 2% annual inflation on average
- The Fed strives to "anchor" inflation expectations at roughly 2%
- **"Anchored" expectations** (per Ben Bernanke, 2022): expectations that are relatively insensitive to incoming data and don't change much in response to temporary inflation fluctuations

### Historical Context:
- In the 1970s and 1980s, persistently high inflation caused expectations to become unanchored, creating a "wage-price spiral"
- Academic economists (including Nobel laureates Edmund Phelps and Milton Friedman) emphasized inflation expectations' importance starting in the late 1960s

### Measurement Methods:

**1. Consumer Surveys:**
- University of Michigan Survey (about 600 households monthly) asks about expected price changes over the next year and five to ten years
- For much of the first two decades of the 21st century: one-year expectations hovered around 3.0%, five-to-ten-year expectations around 2.8%
- **June 2022 data:** one-year expectations at 5.3%, five-to-ten-year expectations at 3.1%
- Note: These surveys historically overestimate actual inflation, so analysts focus on trends rather than levels

**2. Professional Forecasts:**
- Survey of Professional Forecasters (SPF) asks economists about CPI and PCE price index outlooks

**3. Market-Based Measures:**
- **10-year breakeven inflation rate:** Calculated by comparing 10-year nominal Treasury yields with 10-year TIPS yields; represents the inflation rate at which investors would earn the same real return on both securities
- **5-Year, 5-Year Forward Inflation Expectation Rate:** Estimates inflation expectations for five years beginning five years from present
- These market-based indicators include both true inflation expectations and a risk premium

**4. Federal Reserve Index:**
- Index of Common Inflation Expectations (CIE) combines 21 measures of inflation expectations
- Was below 2% for much of the late 2010s but began rising in early 2021

### Fed's Tools:
- Monetary policy tools (particularly short-term interest rates) to achieve 2% inflation
- Forward guidance: communications about the likely future course of monetary policy
- **August 2020 framework change:** Adopted "Flexible Average Inflation Targeting" where periods of below-2% inflation would be offset with periods of above-2% inflation

**Note:** The article text appears to end abruptly mid-sentence regarding the Flexible Average Inflation framework.

# Summary of Article: "TIPS Funds Gain on Fears of Inflation and Economic Downturn"

**Source:** Morningstar, Inc. | **Date:** March 05, 2025 | **Author:** Gabe Alpert

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **TIPS Fund Performance (2025 YTD):**
   - TIPS funds have returned an average of 3.4% in 2025
   - This makes them one of the best-performing bond fund categories

2. **Comparative Bond Fund Performance (2025 YTD):**
   - Intermediate core bond funds: 2.7%
   - US corporate bond funds: 2.8%
   - High-yield bonds: 1.8%
   - Long-term bond funds: 4.3% (only category performing better than TIPS)
   - Short-term bond category: 1.4%
   - Short-term inflation-protected bonds category: 2.3%

3. **Specific Fund Performance:**
   - Vanguard Short-Term Inflation-Protected Securities Index Fund (VTIP): $55 billion in assets, 2.2% return in 2025, 6.6% return in 2024
   - Vanguard Inflation-Protected Securities Fund (VIPIX): $26 billion in assets, 3.4% return YTD
   - BlackRock Total Return Fund (MPHQX): $20 billion in assets

4. **Breakeven Inflation Rates:**
   - **Five-year breakeven rate at November election:** 2.3%
   - **Five-year breakeven rate in February:** spiked to 2.66%
   - **Five-year breakeven rate as of Monday (close to article date):** 2.59%
   - The article notes that longer-term breakeven rates have stayed steady by comparison

5. **TIPS Market Characteristics:**
   - Average maturity of TIPS funds: slightly over seven years

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

- **David Rogal** (Head of inflation-linked portfolios at BlackRock, portfolio manager): Explains TIPS have two performance components - duration (sensitivity to interest rate moves) and inflation hedge. Notes that the TIPS market tends toward longer-term bonds with average maturity over seven years.

- **Rob Waldner** (Chief fixed income strategist and head of macro research at Invesco): States "Most of the move [in breakeven rates] has been on the shorter end" and notes longer-term breakeven rates have stayed steady by comparison.

- **Dominic Pappalardo** (Chief multi-asset strategist at Morningstar): 
  - Attributes approximately 80% of the rise in inflation expectations to worries about policy
  - States "Nearly all of the new administration's policies are likely to increase inflation in the short term"
  - Notes Trump's economic policies may dampen growth through tariffs and policy uncertainty
  - Says "TIPs should do better in stagflation"

## Context:

The article attributes the strong TIPS performance to two main factors: fears of economic slowdown (which have lifted bond prices generally) and rising inflation expectations driven by concerns about tariffs imposed by President Trump on Canada and Mexico. The combination of these factors creates stagflation concerns, which particularly benefit TIPS.

Query: Retrieve past 5-year daily data for FRED series T10YIE; compute mean, stdev of 6-day changes; list last 30 daily values.
The information returned by the searches confirms a few key facts that are needed for the task, but it is not yet sufficient to fulfil every element of the original query.

What we have now
1. Series confirmation and latest value  
   • The series ID is T10YIE, “10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate”, expressed in percent and published daily by FRED (fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10YIE).  
   • The latest published observation is 2.27 % for 2026-02-13 (FRED, “Latest observation” in the embedded FREDData block).

2. Documentation on how to pull observations programmatically  
   • The FRED API endpoint fred/series/observations supports downloading the entire history in JSON/CSV (fred.stlouisfed.org/docs/api/fred/series_observations.html).  
   • An API key is required but the structure of the call is clear.

3. Small recent data excerpt  
   • A list of 12 recent daily observations (2026-01-29 through 2026-02-13) is included in the FREDData snippet.

4. High-level summary statistics over the last 1, 5 and 10 years (mean, min, max) are also included in the FREDData snippet.

What is still missing
A. Complete daily history for the past five years (i.e., from 2021-02-13 to 2026-02-13).  
B. From that five-year history, a vector of 6-day changes must be constructed (Δ6 t = value t – value t-6).  
C. Mean and standard deviation of all those 6-day changes over the five-year window.  
D. The last thirty individual daily observations (currently only 12 are listed).

None of the supplied search results contain the raw five-year data or the Δ6 calculations, so the numerical answers requested (mean, standard deviation, full list of the last 30 values) cannot yet be produced.

Additional data needed
• The full set of daily observations for T10YIE from 2021-02-13 through 2026-02-13.  
  – This can be obtained in one call to the FRED API, e.g.  
    https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=T10YIE&observation_start=2021-02-13&api_key=YOURKEY&file_type=json  
• Once downloaded, compute Δ6 for every observation dated ≥ 2021-02-19 (because the first five days have no 6-day lag).  
• Calculate:  
  – mean = ΣΔ6 / N  
  – standard deviation = sqrt( Σ(Δ6 – mean)² / (N-1) )  
• Extract the 30 most recent dates/values from the same dataset.

Because the raw observations are not yet in hand, no further web search is required; the task is purely data retrieval via the FRED API followed by straightforward calculations.

In short, to complete the assignment we still need the five-year daily dataset. The current search results do not include it, so the required statistics and the full 30-day list cannot yet be delivered.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
