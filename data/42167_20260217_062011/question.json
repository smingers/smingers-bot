    "description": "The Federal Reserve Economic Data database (FRED) provides economic data from national, international, public, and private sources. The series T10YIE is a dataset that is tracked by the FRED API. It represents the US' 10-year breakeven inflation rate. The title of the series is \"10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate\". The last data point on the graph (as of creation of this question) is from 2026-02-13 and has a value of 2.27. The units of the series are \"Percent\". The update frequency of the series is \"Daily\". The seasonal adjustment of the series is \"Not Seasonally Adjusted\". An interactive graph for the series can be found [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/T10YIE). Below are the notes attached to the series:\n\n> The breakeven inflation rate represents a measure of expected inflation derived from 10-Year Treasury Constant Maturity Securities (DGS10 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DGS10)) and 10-Year Treasury Inflation-Indexed Constant Maturity Securities (DFII10 (https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/DFII10)). The latest value implies what market participants expect inflation to be in the next 10 years, on average.\r\n> Starting with the update on June 21, 2019, the Treasury bond data used in calculating interest rate spreads is obtained directly from the U.S. Treasury Department (https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/interest-rates/Pages/TextView.aspx?data=yield).\n\n`{\"format\":\"fred_value_at_time\",\"info\":{\"series_id\":\"T10YIE\"}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "Resolves to the value found on the FRED API for the series T10YIE once the data is published.",
    "fine_print": "A script will be used to determine the resolution of this question. It will paginate through the data found at the API endpoint `https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=T10YIE`. This endpoint includes the latest data for the series. The latest revised data will be used when the resolution is assessed. The datapoint matching 2026-02-23 will be used to determine the resolution of this question.\n\nA datapoint matches if:\n1. The series is updated daily and the date of the datapoint is within 1 day previous to the resolution date.\n2. The series is updated weekly and the date of the datapoint is within 7 days previous to the resolution date.\n3. The series is updated monthly and the date of the datapoint is within 31 days previous to the resolution date.\n\nIf the datapoint is clearly skipped, or no datapoint is found after 2 weeks of checking then the question will be annulled.",
