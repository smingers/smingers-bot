Analysis:
The outcome depends on where the FRED series T10YIE (10-Year Breakeven Inflation Rate) prints on the first business day after the resolve date (2026-02-23).  To forecast that, the most useful historical context is:

1. Recent trajectory – the level and short-term trend over the last few weeks and months.
2. Typical short-horizon volatility – the empirical distribution of 5- to 10-day changes over several years, so we can judge how far the rate usually moves in six calendar days.
3. Macro or market news that could plausibly shift breakevens (e.g., CPI surprises, Fed communications, energy-price shocks).

Therefore we need:
• A time series pull of T10YIE to compute historical daily changes and recent values.
• Any news in the last few days affecting inflation expectations.
• General background pages that summarize the series and may link to csv downloads.
