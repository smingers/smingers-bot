The 10-year benchmark bond yield was at 6.6693 percent, slightly up from 6.666 percent in the previous session. Investors remained cautious due to a supply glut, despite recent bond price gains driven by the government's debt switch from 2027 to 2040 bonds. Traders expect yields to remain elevated, as the government anticipates significant gross issuance in the next fiscal year, raising concerns that demand may not match supply.

This followed the release of the U.S. January Consumer Price Index (CPI), which showed an inflation rate below market expectations, leading to reduced concerns about inflation from the U.S. Federal Reserve (FRB). As a result, U.S. long-term bonds saw buying pressure on January 13, and this momentum carried into the European market on the morning of February 16, with increased buying in German and other long-term bonds. However, there were limited additional catalysts to drive German long-term bonds further, constraining the extent of the yield decline. Meanwhile, the yield on the UK's 10-year bond also decreased, standing at approximately 4.3% in the latter half of the range, down by about 0.03% compared to the same time point on the previous weekend, according to the Nikkei News.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 05:17 PM\nSource:[\u65e5\u672c\u7d4c\u6e08\u65b0\u805e](https://www.nikkei.com/article/DGXZQOFL16A5N0W6A210C2000000/)\n\n**BREAKING: Nigeria\u2019s inflation eases to 15.10% in January 2026**\nNigeria's headline inflation rate decreased slightly to 15.10% in January 2026, down from 15.15% in December 2025, according to the National Bureau of Statistics (NBS) Consumer Price Index report.

The Central Bank of Russia reduced the key rate by 0.5 percentage points to 15.5% annually during its latest board meeting, marking the sixth consecutive reduction. Shenderyuk-Zhidkov noted that the updated Central Bank forecast now expects the average key rate for the year to be in the range of 13.5\u201314.5%, down from the previous 13\u201315% forecast. He stated that under current inflation dynamics, a rate of 10% by year-end is plausible. Furthermore, he projected that by 2027, the rate could stabilize at an average of 8\u20139%, with further declines expected afterward. He added that this would allow the economy to reach levels comfortable for both corporate and personal lending. The Central Bank revised its forecast for 2026 to 13.5\u201314.5% (previously 13\u201315%) and for 2027 to 8\u20139% (previously 7.5\u20138.5%).\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 12:23 PM\nSource:[\u041f\u0420\u0410\u0419\u041c](https://1prime.ru/20260216/stavka-867532257.html)\n\n**Kazakhstan's Budget Deficit Reaches 4.4 Trillion Tenge, Inflation Trends Show Signs of Moderation**\nThe budget deficit of Kazakhstan reached 4.4 trillion tenge, according to the Eurasian Bank of Regional Development (EA BR), accounting for approximately 90% of the planned level of 4.9 trillion tenge. The revenue side of the budget was fully met, with a 10.1% increase driven by tax receipts, particularly from corporate income tax and value-added tax. Expenditures rose by 10.3%, mainly due to increased funding for legal services and education. The growth in foreign exchange inflows, primarily from Russia, was supported by a 24% year-on-year appreciation of the ruble against the dollar by the end of 2025, while the tenge's exchange rate remained largely unchanged. This inflow boosted domestic liquidity, with domestic trade growing by 17.8% in 2025. Despite ongoing inflationary risks\u2014driven by high inflation expectations, tax policy adjustments, and regulated price changes\u2014the central bank maintains flexibility and may revise fiscal policy parameters if budget conditions shift. The bank expects a gradual easing of monetary policy, with the key interest rate projected at around 13% by the end of 2026. The National Bank of Kazakhstan aims to stabilize inflation at the midpoint of its target band\u20143.5% year-on-year by January 2026\u2014supported by stable currency exchange rates and lower international energy prices. Consumer price inflation is forecast to reach approximately 4.5% by the end of 2026. In January 2026, foreign exchange reserves increased by $8.77 billion, primarily due to rising global gold prices. The reserves cover about 20 months of imports and exceed external debt by more than double, indicating strong economic resilience. Inflation rates have slowed: food inflation dropped to 8.6% year-on-year, seasonal fruits and vegetables fell to 3.7% from 4.9%, and non-food inflation rose to 2.5% amid exchange rate movements. Overall inflation accelerated to 8.2% year-on-year from 8.0% in December. The postponement of utility tariff hikes from January to March helped contain service price increases. Core inflation resumed its downward trajectory, falling to 6.9% year-on-year from 7.3%, with analysts projecting inflation near the updated 2026 target.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 09:48 AM\nSource:[Kazakhstan Today](https://www.kt.kz/rus/ekonomika/defitsit_gosbyudzheta_kazahstana_dostig_4_4_trln_tenge_-_eabr_1377987970.html)\n\n**US 10-year Treasury yield eases as inflation softens | Investing.com ZA**\nUS headline inflation eased to 2.40% in January 2026, the lowest level since May 2025 and below the 2.50% forecast, leading the 10-year Treasury yield to decline to 4.07%. Economists attributed much of the slowdown to base effects from last year\u2019s elevated readings. Markets now price in two additional interest rate cuts later in 2026. Equity futures recovered from early losses, but major indices closed mostly flat: the S&P 500 and Nasdaq were steady, while the Dow Jones lost 100 points, ending a 1.50% weekly decline amid ongoing artificial intelligence (AI) market volatility. Megacap tech and semiconductor stocks were pressured, with Nvidia down 2.20%, Apple 2.30%, Alphabet 1.10%, Meta 1.60%, and Broadcom 1.80%, while Oracle, Palantir, Microsoft, and Micron remained flat.

Fed officials remain cautious: Dallas Fed President Lorie Logan stated that meaningful labor market weakness would be required before further easing, while Cleveland Fed President Beth Hammack suggested rates could remain elevated for some time. Geopolitical developments also supported the rally, as former President Donald Trump indicated progress in talks with Iran.

However, further declines were limited by the Reserve Bank of Australia's (RBA) recent rate hike and its reaffirmed hawkish stance. Governor Michele Bullock stated the central bank remains prepared to tighten policy again if inflationary pressures persist, describing inflation as 'unacceptable' when it has a 'three in front of it'\u2014a reference to inflation above 3%. The RBA continues to project that both headline and core inflation will remain above its target band throughout the year. Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser echoed these concerns, emphasizing that inflation remains elevated and poses a significant challenge.

Economic indicators have consistently exceeded forecasts, with strong performance in building consents, tourism, exports, manufacturing, employment growth, and hours worked\u2014despite a slight rise in the unemployment rate due to increased labor force participation. The RBNZ's own Nowcast Predictor Model shows a +0.55% GDP growth for the December 2025 quarter (up from a forecast of +0.40% and actual growth of +1.10%), and a robust +0.80% forecast for the March 2026 quarter. Inflation data also surpassed expectations: the December quarter CPI rose +0.60% (vs. forecasted +0.20%) and annual inflation increased to 3.10% (from 3.00%), necessitating an upward revision to the RBNZ\u2019s June 2026 annual inflation forecast from 2.20% to a higher level. Despite this, the RBNZ is not expected to raise the OCR before later in the year, but must adopt a more cautious outlook on inflation, signaling a shift from its December 2025 statement that markets had 'got ahead of themselves' in pricing higher rates. The Australian dollar has surged 10% since mid-November 2025, rising from 0.6440 to 0.7075, driven by higher interest rates, fiscal and immigration policies fueling domestic demand, and a shift in global capital flows away from the weakening US dollar. The RBA\u2019s Deputy Governor Andrew Hauser\u2019s statement that inflation is 'too high' and will be controlled further boosted the AUD. Meanwhile, US economic data remains inconsistent: the January Non-Farm Payrolls report of +130,000 jobs was met with skepticism due to prior downward revisions and weak ADP and JOLTS data, while January CPI rose 0.20% (annual rate falling to 2.40%), suggesting weak demand and pricing power. US 10-year Treasury yields dropped to 4.05% from 4.17%, signaling market confidence in declining inflation. The US dollar index held steady between 96.40 and 97.00, reinforcing a downward trend. As a result, the NZD/USD is expected to break above resistance at 0.6120.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 11:27 PM\nSource:[interest.co.nz](https://www.interest.co.nz/currencies/137219/roger-j-kerr-says-local-economic-forecasters-have-been-consistently)\n\n**US 10-Year Yield Holds Advance | Forex News 2026.02.12 (en)**\nThe yield on the US 10-year Treasury note held near 4.18% on Thursday, continuing its rebound from the previous session. This was driven by stronger-than-expected US employment data from January 2026, which showed a 130,000 increase in payrolls\u2014the largest monthly gain in over a year\u2014and an unexpected decline in the unemployment rate to 4.3%. These figures indicated a stabilizing labor market at the start of 2026, reinforcing Federal Reserve officials' stance to maintain current interest rates. As a result, market expectations shifted, with the next rate cut now projected for July instead of June. However, traders still anticipate approximately 50 basis points of total rate cuts by the end of 2026. Investors are now awaiting Friday's January Consumer Price Index (CPI) release for further insights into inflation trends.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 03:35 AM\nSource:[InstaForex](https://www.instaforex.com/forex-news/2891211)\n\n**The True Value of 1 Crore After 10 Years: Inflation\u2019s Silent Erosion of Wealth**\nThe article discusses the declining purchasing power of \u20b91 crore over the next 10 years due to inflation in India. It explains that while \u20b91 crore may seem like a substantial retirement goal today, inflation\u2014measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI)\u2014erodes its real value over time. Assuming an average annual inflation rate of 5% to 6%, the real value of \u20b91 crore in 10 years will significantly decrease, potentially reducing it to the equivalent of only \u20b955 lakh to \u20b960 lakh in today\u2019s terms. The article warns that relying solely on traditional investments like fixed deposits (FDs) or savings accounts, which typically offer returns lower than inflation, will not preserve wealth. It emphasizes the need to shift focus from mere saving to active wealth creation through smarter investment strategies to maintain one\u2019s standard of living in retirement.

November's Consumer Price Index (CPI) showed a headline inflation rate of 2.7%, the lowest since July and below the expected 3.1%, while core inflation fell to 2.6%, the slowest pace since early 2021. Concurrently, the November unemployment rate increased to 4.6%, the highest since 2021. These developments suggest the Federal Reserve has greater flexibility to cut interest rates in 2026, though market expectations indicate rates will likely remain unchanged in January. Investors are now focusing on potential rate reductions in March and July 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 19, 2025 04:43 AM\nSource:[InstaForex](https://www.instaforex.com/forex-news/2844244)\n\n**UK 10-Year Bond Yield Falls | Forex News 2025.12.17 (en)**\nThe yield on the UK's 10-year government bonds (gilts) fell to 4.45%, the lowest level in over a week, following the release of inflation data that came in significantly below expectations. November's annual inflation rate dropped to 3.2%, below both the forecasted 3.5% and the Bank of England's projected 3.4%. This, combined with a rise in the unemployment rate to its highest level since 2021 and slower-than-expected wage growth, along with two consecutive months of economic contraction in October, has strengthened market expectations that the Bank of England will cut interest rates by 25 basis points to 3.75% on Thursday\u2014its lowest level since 2022. The pause in rate changes in September and November has been followed by renewed anticipation of monetary easing. Markets now expect approximately 66 basis points of easing by 2026, up from 58 basis points prior to the CPI data release.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 17, 2025 09:01 AM\nSource:[InstaForex](https://www.instaforex.com/forex-news/2841732)\n\n**US yields rise after Fed comments as economic outlook gauged**\nU.S. 10-year Treasury yields rose 4.5 basis points to 4.186% on Friday, marking a second consecutive weekly increase, after a series of Federal Reserve speakers commented on the central bank\u2019s recent policy decisions. The rise followed a rate cut on Wednesday, which was accompanied by a signal of a near-term pause due to expectations of stronger economic growth in 2026. The Fed also began purchasing short-dated government bonds on Friday to manage market liquidity and maintain control over its interest rate target system. Despite the rate cut, Fed officials who opposed it expressed concern that inflation remains too high to justify lowering borrowing costs, particularly amid a lack of official data due to the extended government shutdown. The two-year Treasury yield rose 1.1 basis points to 3.541%, while the 30-year bond yield climbed 5.9 basis points to 4.849%. The yield curve, measured by the gap between two- and 10-year notes, reached 64.3 basis points\u2014its widest since April 21\u2014indicating a bear-steepening trend, reflecting market expectations of stronger growth and persistent inflation. Tony Welch, chief investment officer at SignatureFD, noted that the market is repricing expectations around a robust economic outlook for next year. The 10-year TIPS breakeven rate stood at 2.272%, suggesting market expectations of average annual inflation of about 2.3% over the next decade, while the five-year TIPS breakeven rate was at 2.325%, the lowest in a week.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 12, 2025 04:20 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/us-yields-rise-after-fed-comments-as-economic-outlook-gauged/articleshow/125936358.cms)\n\n**Inflation Surprise Absent: Will U.S. 10-Year Yield Continue Rising? Reuters Survey Weighs In**\nAccording to a Reuters survey conducted from November 6 to 13, 2025, with over 50 bond market strategists, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield is expected to rise slightly in the coming months to 4.10% in three months, 4.10% in six months, and potentially reach 4.21% within a year, based on a current baseline of 4.09%. Despite the U.S. government's reopening and renewed market focus on inflation and Federal Reserve policy, the overall bond market outlook remains relatively stable. Short-term yields are projected to decline, with the 2-year yield expected to fall from 3.58% to 3.50% in three months and 3.40% in six months. Market pricing, including inflation breakeven rates from TIPS, indicates inflation expectations remain below earlier 2025 levels. BlackRock\u2019s Jean Boivin cautioned against overreacting to short-term data, emphasizing that markets will eventually reflect long-term inflation risks. Although core inflation remains near 3%, above the Fed\u2019s 2% target, and consumer inflation expectations remain elevated, Federal Reserve officials like Boston Fed\u2019s Susan Collins warn that inflation\u2019s resilience demands cautious interest rate cuts. A majority of 26 out of 34 surveyed strategists expect the yield curve to steepen slightly before January 2026, driven by rising term premiums due to expected increased long-term Treasury issuance, particularly from the upcoming November 2025 refunding conference. Market volatility may increase as official data resumes post-government shutdown, but the medium-term yield trajectory is expected to remain one of modest adjustment.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 04:00 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The current 10-year yield stands at 4.09%. Meanwhile, the two-year Treasury yield, currently at 3.58%, is forecast to decline to 3.50% in three months and 3.40% in six months, reflecting market expectations of rate cuts. Market pricing, including breakeven rates from inflation-protected Treasuries, indicates lower inflation expectations compared to earlier in the year. This trend persists despite the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge remaining near 3%\u2014above the 2% target\u2014for over four years and elevated consumer inflation expectations. The absence of official inflation data during the recent record-breaking government shutdown and ongoing uncertainty around U.S. tariffs have contributed to subdued inflation pricing. Boston Fed President Susan Collins emphasized caution regarding rate easing ahead of the December 17\u201318 Fed meeting. Over three-quarters of respondents (26 out of 34) expect the yield curve to modestly steepen by end-January 2026. Michael Chang of Citi noted that rising Treasury issuance, particularly expected in the November refunding meeting, will likely increase the 'term premium'\u2014compensation for long-term debt\u2014leading to a steeper curve, with long-end yields underperforming shorter maturities.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 02:06 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-10year-treasury-yields-priced-for-no-inflation-surprises-set-to-rise-modestly-reuters-poll-4355497)\n\n**US 10-year Treasury yields priced for no inflation surprises, set to rise modestly: Reuters poll**\nAccording to a Reuters poll of over 50 bond strategists conducted from November 6 to 13, 2025, U.S. 10-year Treasury yields are expected to rise modestly to 4.10% in three and six months, and to 4.21% within a year, assuming no significant upside inflation surprises. The current 10-year yield stands at 4.09%. Despite a projected $3 trillion in additional borrowing over the next decade due to President Donald Trump\u2019s recently passed budget, the anticipated surge in supply has not yet materially impacted market pricing. Market-based inflation expectations, as reflected in breakeven rates from inflation-protected Treasury securities, are lower than earlier in the year, coinciding with the absence of official inflation data during the longest government shutdown in U.S. history, which ended on November 12, 2025. Jean Boivin, head of the BlackRock Investment Institute, noted that bond markets tend to overreact to short-term developments, suggesting the market may be over-indexing on recent inflation trends. He cautioned against positioning for near-term inflation moves, as markets will eventually correct to reflect more accurate inflation expectations. Meanwhile, the Federal Reserve\u2019s preferred inflation gauge remains near 3%, above the 2% target, for over four years, and consumer inflation expectations have stayed elevated. Boston Fed President Susan Collins emphasized caution regarding future rate cuts, particularly ahead of the December 17\u201318, 2025, Federal Open Market Committee meeting. The two-year Treasury yield, currently at 3.58%, is forecast to decline to 3.50% in three months and 3.40% in six months. Despite internal divisions on the Fed, interest rate futures still price in three to four rate cuts by the end of 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 02:04 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!
