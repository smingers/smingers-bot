Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Yahoo Finance Quote Page (SO)** - High quality, current data as of 2026-02-16. Provides factual market data including close price of $94.95, ex-dividend date of Feb 17, 2026, and upcoming earnings date of Feb 19, 2026. The analyst target estimate of $95.78 is opinion-based but from professional analysts. Beta of 0.45 is factual historical calculation.

**Southern Company Investor Relations (Dividend Page)** - Primary source, highest quality. Factual information confirming $0.74 dividend with ex-dividend date of Feb 17, 2026, and payment date of March 6, 2026. Historical dividend progression is factual.

**Stock Analysis (Dividend History)** - Good quality aggregator. Confirms dividend details and provides Feb 13, 2026 close price of $94.95. All dividend metrics are factual.

**Stock Events (Dividend Information)** - Good quality. Confirms Feb 17, 2026 ex-dividend date and $0.74 dividend amount. Factual information.

**Finviz/Zacks (Earnings Preview)** - Dated before Feb 17, 2026. Provides factual earnings expectations: $0.56 EPS expected for Q4 2025 earnings on Feb 19, 2026. The Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) and negative ESP of -4.76% are opinion-based ratings from Zacks methodology. Historical beat rate (3 out of 4 quarters) is factual.

**Yahoo Finance/Zacks (Feb 10 article)** - Pre-Feb 17 data. Factual: SO closed at $90.72 on Feb 10, up 3.04% over past month. Forward P/E of 19.53 is factual. Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) is opinion-based.

**Nasdaq/Zacks (Q4 Preview)** - Pre-Feb 17. Provides detailed segment revenue estimates (opinion-based forecasts). Stock returned +4.3% over past month (factual). Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) is opinion.

**Agent Report** - Identifies critical data gap: lacks complete 5-year daily price series needed to calculate 9-day return distribution. Provides context: 5-year mean $69.66, one-year mean $89.82 with σ ≈ $3.08 (low volatility). Beta 0.45 confirmed. Analysis is sound but incomplete due to missing data.

**FRED Data (10-Year Treasury)** - High quality government data. Shows 10-year yield at 4.09% as of Feb 12, 2026, down from 4.62% year-ago. Relevant for utility sector sensitivity to interest rates.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **9-trading-day returns for SO specifically** - Most specific and relevant. Agent report indicates this would require complete 5-year daily data to calculate ~1,247 overlapping 9-day returns. This is the ideal reference class but data is incomplete.

2. **Short-term returns for regulated utilities around ex-dividend dates** - Highly relevant given Feb 17 is ex-dividend date. Utilities typically drop by approximately the dividend amount ($0.74) on ex-dividend date, then may recover over subsequent days.

3. **Short-term returns for defensive/low-beta stocks** - SO has beta of 0.45, making it defensive. Over 9 trading days (roughly 2 weeks), defensive stocks show lower volatility but also lower directional bias.

4. **General equity market short-term returns** - Less suitable due to SO's defensive characteristics and utility-specific factors.

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** Combination of #2 (ex-dividend dynamics) and #3 (low-beta utility behavior), since the timeframe specifically spans an ex-dividend date with known mechanical price effects.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 9 trading days (Feb 17 to Feb 28, 2026 = approximately 11 calendar days, ~9 trading days accounting for weekends).

**Key Events in Window:**
- Feb 17: Ex-dividend date (mechanical ~$0.74 drop expected)
- Feb 19: Q4 2025 earnings release
- Feb 28: Resolution date

**Historical Patterns:**

From available data:
- One-year daily volatility σ ≈ $3.08 (about 3.4% of current price)
- Over past month (pre-Feb 17): +3.04% gain
- Stock closed at $90.72 on Feb 10, then $94.95 on Feb 16 = +4.66% gain in 4 trading days
- Beta 0.45 suggests SO moves roughly half as much as broader market

**Ex-Dividend Mechanics:**
- On Feb 17 (ex-div date), stock mechanically adjusts down by ~$0.74
- If Feb 17 close is $94.95, expected mechanical adjustment would bring it to ~$94.21
- Question asks if Feb 28 close > Feb 17 close
- Therefore, stock needs to recover $0.74 plus any additional gains over ~9 trading days

**Earnings Impact:**
- Earnings on Feb 19 with expectations of $0.56 EPS (+12% YoY)
- Historical: beat 3 out of last 4 quarters
- However, Zacks ESP is negative (-4.76%) suggesting lower probability of beat
- Earnings surprises can move utility stocks 2-5% typically

## (d) Justification

The question asks whether SO's close on Feb 28 will exceed its close on Feb 17. This is complicated by the ex-dividend date falling on Feb 17.

**Key Factors:**

1. **Ex-Dividend Effect (Negative):** Feb 17 is the ex-dividend date. The stock will mechanically adjust downward by approximately $0.74 (the dividend amount) on Feb 17. This creates an immediate ~0.78% headwind ($0.74/$94.95).

2. **Earnings Catalyst (Uncertain):** Feb 19 earnings could provide upward momentum. Expected EPS of $0.56 represents 12% YoY growth. Historical beat rate is 75% (3 of 4 quarters), but Zacks ESP is negative, suggesting lower beat probability this time. Earnings beats in utilities typically generate 2-3% moves.

3. **Recent Momentum (Positive):** Stock gained 4.66% from Feb 10 to Feb 16, showing strong recent momentum. Past month gain of 3.04% also positive.

4. **Low Volatility Profile (Neutral to Negative for large moves):** With σ ≈ $3.08 daily and beta 0.45, SO is a low-volatility defensive stock. Over 9 trading days, expected random walk would be small. This makes recovering the $0.74 dividend adjustment plus additional gains less likely in the short timeframe.

5. **Interest Rate Environment (Slightly Positive):** 10-year Treasury down from 4.62% to 4.09% YoY, which is favorable for utilities as they benefit from lower rates.

6. **Base Rate for Short-Term Positive Returns:** Without the complete 5-year daily data, I estimate that for a low-beta utility stock, 9-day returns are positive roughly 52-55% of the time in normal conditions (slight positive drift from equity risk premium).

**Critical Calculation:**
- Feb 17 close will likely be mechanically reduced by ~$0.74 from where it would otherwise be
- To answer "Yes," Feb 28 must close above Feb 17's actual close
- This requires recovering the dividend adjustment ($0.74) plus any natural drift
- Over 9 trading days, with daily σ ≈ $3.08, the 9-day σ ≈ $9.24 (√9 × $3.08)
- Needing to gain $0.74+ represents about 0.08 standard deviations, which is modest
- However, the ex-dividend effect is a one-time mechanical adjustment that doesn't reverse automatically

Outside view calibration:

The base rate for 9-day positive returns in equities is typically 52-55% (slight positive drift). However, this situation has a specific mechanical headwind: the ex-dividend adjustment on Feb 17.

The stock needs to:
1. Overcome the ~$0.74 dividend adjustment (0.78% of $94.95)
2. Show additional gain to exceed Feb 17 close

With 9 trading days and typical daily volatility, recovering 0.78% is achievable but not guaranteed. The earnings release on Feb 19 is the main catalyst that could drive recovery, but:
- Zacks ESP is negative (-4.76%)
- Rank #4 (Sell) suggests analyst pessimism
- Even if earnings beat, typical utility moves are 2-3%, which would easily overcome the dividend adjustment

Weighing factors:
- Base rate: ~53% for positive 9-day returns
- Ex-dividend headwind: -5 to -8 percentage points (mechanical adjustment that must be overcome)
- Earnings catalyst potential: +3 to +5 percentage points (if beat occurs, ~40-50% probability)
- Recent momentum: +2 to +3 percentage points

Net adjustment: 53% - 6% + 4% + 2.5% = 53.5%

However, I should be more conservative given the mechanical nature of the ex-dividend adjustment and the short timeframe. The dividend effect is certain, while recovery is probabilistic.

Outside View Prediction:
47%
