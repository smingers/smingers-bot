Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:
The provided sources fall into three categories:

**High-quality, factual sources:**
1. Stock Events & StockAnalysis.com (Feb 17, 2026): Factual dividend data confirming $0.74 quarterly dividend with ex-dividend date Feb 17, 2026. These are reliable, verifiable facts about corporate actions.

2. Stock Titan (Jan 28, 2026): Corporate announcement of dividend declaration. Factual, high reliability.

3. Morningstar (Feb 6, 2026): Sector analysis of utilities stocks. While SO is not mentioned, provides factual context about the utilities sector's 17.17% 12-month performance. No specific SO opinions.

**Irrelevant sources:**
4. Multiple articles about Southern Copper Corporation (SCCO), not Southern Company (SO). These are completely irrelevant to the question.

5. AskNews articles: Predominantly about other companies with similar tickers (SOMA.OL, SOKM.IS, SOE, etc.) or unrelated stocks. The only relevant item is the FactSet survey from Oct 13, 2025 showing analyst target price raised to $102 (median), but this is 4+ months old and less relevant for an 8-day forecast.

**Key factual insight:** Feb 17, 2026 is the ex-dividend date for a $0.74 dividend. This is the critical mechanical factor for the comparison period.

(b) Evidence analysis:

**Strong evidence:**
- Ex-dividend date mechanics (Feb 17): On ex-dividend dates, stocks typically drop by approximately the dividend amount at open, then partially recover over subsequent days. This is a well-established, reliable pattern. For SO's $0.74 dividend on a ~$95 stock, this represents a ~0.78% mechanical drop, followed by typical partial recovery of 25-40% over the following week.

**Moderate evidence:**
- Utilities sector momentum: Morningstar data shows the sector outperformed the broader market over 12 months (17.17% vs 14.71%). This suggests modest positive sentiment toward defensive utilities, though the effect over 8 days is minimal.
- Historical base rate: The outside view establishes SO's 8-9 day positive return probability at ~57%, with low volatility (σ ≈ 2.15% over 8 days).

**Weak evidence:**
- Analyst target price of $102 from October 2025: While above current price, this is a long-term target and doesn't meaningfully inform an 8-day forecast.
- Earnings date (Feb 19): Falls within the window but direction is unpredictable. Adds variance, not directional bias.

(c) Timeframe analysis:
The prediction covers 8 trading days (Feb 17 close to Feb 28, which resolves using Feb 27 close since markets are closed Feb 28). 

**If halved to 4 days:** The ex-dividend recovery would be incomplete, reducing the probability of a positive return to perhaps 52-54%. The shorter window gives less time for mean reversion or dividend recovery.

**If doubled to 16 days:** The dividend recovery would be more complete, and the normal upward drift of utilities would accumulate more. Probability would increase to perhaps 62-65%.

The 8-day window is in a "middle zone" where the ex-dividend effect is significant but recovery is only partial.

(d) Justification for adjusting outside view:

Starting from the 58% outside view baseline, I need to consider:

1. **Ex-dividend mechanics (already incorporated in outside view):** The outside view analysis already accounts for the Feb 17 ex-dividend date and estimates a +5 percentage point boost from partial dividend recovery, offset by -4 points for earnings uncertainty, arriving at 58%.

2. **Current market context:** The close price on Feb 13 was $94.95, and Feb 17 is the ex-dividend date. The stock will mechanically drop ~$0.74 at open on Feb 17, setting the comparison baseline at approximately $94.20. Historical patterns suggest 25-40% recovery of the dividend over the next 8 days, implying a gain of $0.19-$0.30, bringing the price to $94.39-$94.50 by Feb 27—slightly below the Feb 13 close but above the Feb 17 post-dividend close.

3. **Earnings event (Feb 19):** This introduces uncertainty. Consensus EPS is $0.56. Zacks has a Rank #4 "Sell" but this is a proprietary opinion with limited predictive power for a 2-day forward event. The earnings could swing the stock ±1.5% in either direction, but this is already factored into the outside view's -4 point adjustment.

4. **Sector stability:** Utilities are defensive with low volatility. No significant regulatory or weather events are indicated in the sources. The status quo suggests modest stability.

**Conclusion:** The outside view analysis is thorough and already incorporates the key mechanical factors (ex-dividend, earnings risk, partial recovery). The current information doesn't reveal new factors that would justify a significant shift. The 58% baseline remains appropriate.

Probability calibration:

The outside view of 58% is well-grounded in:
- Historical 57% base rate for 8-9 day positive returns
- +5 points for ex-dividend recovery mechanics
- -4 points for earnings uncertainty

Current information confirms the ex-dividend date and provides no contradictory evidence. The comparison starts from the post-dividend close on Feb 17, and historical patterns suggest a modest recovery over the following 8 days. However, the earnings event on Feb 19 introduces meaningful two-way risk.

A 58% probability implies that in 58 out of 100 similar scenarios, the Feb 27 close would exceed the Feb 17 close. This feels calibrated: slightly better than a coin flip due to the dividend recovery pattern, but not strongly so due to earnings volatility and the short timeframe.

I consider whether to adjust to 55% or 60%:
- 55% would underweight the dividend recovery effect
- 60% would overweight it given the earnings uncertainty

I'll maintain 58% as it appropriately balances these factors.

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will SO's closing price on Feb 27, 2026 (market closed Feb 28) be higher than its Feb 17, 2026 close? 8-day window.

2. **Outside view base rate:** 58%, derived from 57% historical base rate plus ex-dividend recovery mechanics minus earnings uncertainty.

3. **Consistency check:** "58 out of 100 times, SO's Feb 27 close exceeds its Feb 17 close." This aligns with modest dividend recovery partially offset by earnings volatility.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Ex-dividend date Feb 17 creates mechanical ~$0.74 drop, then partial recovery (strong, factual)
   - Historical 8-day positive return rate ~57% for SO (strong, empirical)
   - Earnings announcement Feb 19 adds ±1.5% volatility (moderate, historical pattern)
   - Utilities sector showing stability, no major shocks indicated (moderate, contextual)

5. **Blind-spot:** Negative earnings surprise on Feb 19 coupled with broader market weakness could drive a -3% to -5% move, overwhelming the dividend recovery. This would make 58% look overconfident. However, the probability of such a scenario is ~15-20%, already reflected in the calibration.

6. **Status quo:** Utilities are stable, low-volatility assets. The status quo suggests modest mean reversion and dividend recovery. An 8-day window is short enough that dramatic changes are unlikely. The 58% prediction appropriately reflects this stability with a slight positive bias.

Probability: 58%
