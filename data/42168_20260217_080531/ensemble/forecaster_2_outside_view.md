Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Yahoo Finance Quote Page (SO)** - High quality, current data as of 2026-02-16. Provides factual market data including close price of $94.95, ex-dividend date of Feb 17, 2026, upcoming earnings date of Feb 19, 2026. The analyst target estimate of $95.78 is opinion-based but from professional analysts. Beta of 0.45 confirms low volatility characteristic of utilities.

**Southern Company Investor Relations (Dividends)** - Primary source, highest quality. Factual data showing $0.74 dividend with ex-dividend date of Feb 17, 2026. This is critical: stocks typically drop by approximately the dividend amount on ex-dividend dates due to mechanical market adjustment.

**Stock Analysis (Dividend History)** - Good quality aggregator. Confirms dividend yield of 3.12%, quarterly dividend of $0.74, ex-dividend date Feb 17, 2026. Data is from Feb 13, 2026, slightly stale but consistent with other sources.

**Stock Events (Dividend Info)** - Good quality. Reconfirms Feb 17, 2026 ex-dividend date and $0.74 dividend amount. Explicitly notes the mechanical price drop effect on ex-dividend dates.

**Zacks/Finviz Earnings Preview (Feb 19)** - Medium-high quality. Factual upcoming earnings date (Feb 19, 2026) with consensus estimates. Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) is their proprietary opinion. Negative Earnings ESP of -4.76% suggests potential for missing estimates, though historical beat rate is 3 out of 4 quarters.

**Yahoo Finance/Zacks (Feb 10, 2026)** - Recent data showing SO at $90.72 on Feb 10, up 3.04% over prior month. Forward P/E of 19.53 is factual. Zacks #4 Sell ranking is opinion-based.

**Nasdaq/Zacks Q4 Preview** - Detailed revenue segment estimates for Q4 earnings. Zacks #4 Sell ranking repeated. Stock returned +4.3% over past month vs S&P 500's -2%.

**Agent Report on 9-day Returns** - Identifies critical data gap: lacks complete 5-year daily price series needed to calculate empirical 9-day return distribution. Notes low volatility (σ ≈ 3.08 USD over one year), beta of 0.45, and five-year range of $47.44-$98.91. Cannot provide requested probability without full dataset.

**FRED 10-Year Treasury Data** - High quality government data. Shows 10-year yield at 4.09% as of Feb 12, 2026, down from 4.62% year-ago. Declining rates are generally supportive for utility stocks as bond proxies become more attractive when yields fall.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **9-trading-day returns for SO specifically** - Most relevant but data unavailable in sources. Agent report identifies this gap.

2. **Utility sector stocks over 9-day periods** - Highly relevant given SO's defensive characteristics (beta 0.45, dividend yield 3.12%). Utilities typically exhibit low volatility and mean-reverting behavior.

3. **S&P 500 stocks over 9-day periods** - Broader reference class. Historical studies suggest ~53-55% probability of positive returns over short horizons for broad market.

4. **Ex-dividend date effects** - Critical for this specific question. Feb 17 is ex-dividend date with $0.74 dividend. Stocks mechanically drop by approximately the dividend amount on ex-dividend, creating a ~0.78% headwind ($0.74/$94.95).

5. **Earnings announcement effects for utilities** - Feb 19 earnings release falls within the forecast window. Utilities typically show muted reactions to earnings given regulated nature.

**Most suitable reference class:** A combination of (2) utility sector short-term returns adjusted for (4) ex-dividend effects and (5) earnings announcement timing.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 9 trading days (Feb 17, 2026 to Feb 28, 2026, assuming ~9 trading days given weekends).

**Key events in window:**
- Feb 17: Ex-dividend date (mechanical ~$0.74 drop expected)
- Feb 19: Q4 earnings announcement
- Feb 28: Resolution date

**Historical patterns:**

From the sources:
- SO gained 3.04% over past month (through Feb 10)
- Stock at $90.72 on Feb 10, reached $94.95 by Feb 16 (+4.7% in 6 days)
- Recent momentum is positive
- One-year volatility σ ≈ 3.08 USD suggests daily moves average ~3.2% (3.08/94.95)
- Over 9 days, cumulative volatility would be ~9.6% (3.2% × √9)

**Ex-dividend adjustment:** The $0.74 dividend represents 0.78% of the $94.95 close price. On Feb 17, the stock should open approximately $0.74 lower, all else equal, creating an immediate headwind.

**Earnings catalyst:** Consensus expects $0.56 EPS (12% growth). However, Zacks ESP is -4.76% (negative) with Rank #4 (Sell), suggesting ~30% probability of beating estimates based on their methodology. Historical beat rate is 75% (3 of 4 quarters), creating tension between recent track record and current setup.

## (d) Justification

**Base case for utility stocks:** Without special factors, short-term returns for low-volatility utility stocks should hover around 50-52% probability of being positive over 9-day periods, slightly above coin-flip due to long-term equity risk premium.

**Adjustment factors:**

1. **Ex-dividend headwind (-8 to -10 percentage points):** The mechanical $0.74 drop on Feb 17 creates a 0.78% immediate loss that must be overcome. This significantly reduces the probability of ending higher by Feb 28.

2. **Recent momentum (+3 to +5 percentage points):** Stock has shown strong recent performance, up 4.7% from Feb 10 to Feb 16, suggesting positive sentiment.

3. **Earnings uncertainty (neutral to -2 percentage points):** Feb 19 earnings with negative ESP but strong historical beat rate creates uncertainty. Utilities typically show muted reactions, but a miss could pressure the stock.

4. **Declining interest rates (+2 to +3 percentage points):** 10-year Treasury down from 4.62% to 4.09% year-over-year makes utility dividends more attractive, providing support.

5. **Mean reversion consideration (-2 percentage points):** After strong recent run from $90.72 to $94.95, some consolidation is possible.

**Net assessment:** Starting from ~51% base rate, the ex-dividend effect is the dominant factor, reducing probability by ~8-10 points. Positive momentum and declining rates add back ~5-8 points. Earnings uncertainty and mean reversion subtract ~2-4 points.

Outside view calibration:

The ex-dividend effect is mechanical and well-documented in financial literature. A $0.74 dividend on a $94.95 stock represents a 0.78% headwind that must be overcome through organic price appreciation. 

For a low-volatility utility (beta 0.45, daily σ ~3.2%), achieving 0.78%+ appreciation over 9 trading days requires either:
- Sustained positive drift (~0.09% per day)
- A positive catalyst (earnings beat)
- Continued momentum from recent strength

The probability should be calibrated below 50% due to the ex-dividend headwind, but not dramatically so given:
- Recent strong momentum (up 4.7% in 6 days)
- Supportive rate environment
- Defensive sector characteristics
- 75% historical earnings beat rate

Historical upset rate for utility stocks over short periods is relatively low given mean-reverting behavior, but earnings announcements can create 2-5% moves in either direction.

Anchoring to the ex-dividend effect: If the stock simply adjusted for the dividend and traded flat otherwise, probability would be ~0%. However, 9 trading days allows time for recovery. With daily volatility of 3.2%, a 0.78% recovery over 9 days requires only 0.09% daily drift—achievable but not assured.

My calibration suggests 42-48% range, with best estimate around 45%.
