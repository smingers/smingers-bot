Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (quality, facts vs. opinion, date – only the handful that are truly pertinent)

1. Stock Events / StockAnalysis dividend pages (17 Feb 2026 & 13 Feb 2026).  
   • Facts: $0.74 quarterly dividend, ex-dividend 17 Feb 2026, pay date 6 Mar 2026, yield ≈3.1 %.  
   • Opinion: generic remark that “stocks typically fall the dividend amount”.  
   • Quality: very high for dividend mechanics (data taken from company filings).

2. Yahoo Finance SO quote page (snap-shot evening 16 Feb 2026).  
   • Facts: last close $94.95, beta 0.45, 1-yr target $95.78.  
   • Opinion: “Undervalued 4 %” is model output, ignored.  
   • Quality: high for raw prices, neutral for target estimate.

3. Zacks / other earnings-preview notes (not pasted but referred in IR calendars).  
   • Facts: earnings due 19 Feb 2026 (Q4-25), consensus EPS ~$0.31.  
   • Opinion: Zacks Rank #4 (Sell) – lightly weighted.  
   • Quality: consensus numbers reliable; sentiment score weak.

4. FRED DGS10 (10-yr Treasury) 4.09 % on 12 Feb 2026, down ~20 bp month-on-month.  
   • Facts only; reliable macro data.  
   • Relevance: lower yields mildly bullish for utilities.

5. Historic behaviour of ex-dividend stocks – academic literature (not new article).  
   • Facts: average price drop ≈ dividend at the open of ex-div day, partial recovery thereafter.  
   • Quality: strong statistical evidence, though variance is large.

All other AskNews clips concern the wrong tickers (“SOMA, SOKM, …”) or are dated far earlier: discarded.

(b) Evidence weighing

Strong evidence  
• Mechanical ex-dividend price drop on 17 Feb means the reference price is likely depressed by ~$0.74 (≈-0.78 %).  
• Utilities are low-beta; move direction is largely random over 8-9 sessions → outside-view ≈50–53 %.

Moderate evidence  
• Treasury yields trending lower – historically modest positive for the sector.  
• Upcoming earnings on 19 Feb injects extra volatility but with near-zero directional bias.

Weak evidence  
• Analyst target inching to $102 (FactSet, Oct-25) – stale, marginal.  
• Zacks Rank (#4) – model noise over such a short window.

Net directional push: ex-div drop + mild rate tail-wind ⇒ tilt upward vs. base rate.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Resolution: close of Friday 27 Feb 2026 (last trading day before 28 Feb) → 8-9 trading days.  
• If horizon were halved (4–5 days) probability would fall ~2 pp (less time to claw back ex-div drop).  
• If doubled (18 days) probability would rise ~3 pp (more drift time).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate for a large-cap utility beating its own price over 9 trading days ≈53 %.  
Add +4 pp for the artificial downward bias created by the $0.74 ex-dividend drop which is frequently at least partially reversed.  
Add +1 pp for slightly friendlier macro (rates edging down).  
Subtract -2 pp for symmetric earnings-event risk on 19 Feb.  
Final inside-view: 53 + 4 + 1 – 2 ≈ 56 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that roughly 56 times out of 100, Southern Company’s closing price on 27 Feb 2026 will exceed its 17 Feb 2026 close.”

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will SO close higher on 27/28 Feb than on 17 Feb 2026?”  
2. Outside-view base 53 %.  
3. Consistency – “56 out of 100 times the price is higher.”  
4. Key evidence (≤20 w each):  
   • Ex-dividend 17 Feb depresses starting price by ~$0.74.  
   • Typical 2-week win-rate for utilities ≈50–53 %.  
   • 10-yr Treasury yield down 20 bp this month.  
   • Q4 earnings 19 Feb adds symmetric ±3 % jump risk.  
5. Blind-spot – Large post-earnings negative surprise (e.g., Vogtle cost overrun) sending shares -3 %+.  
6. Status-quo bias – short horizon, low-beta stock → keep forecast near 50 %.

Probability: 56%
