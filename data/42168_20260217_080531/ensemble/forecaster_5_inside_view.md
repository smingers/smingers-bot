Analysis:
1. Source analysis (chronological, most relevant first)  
a. Stock Events (17 Feb 2026) – factual: confirms US$0.74 dividend, 17 Feb is ex-dividend date.  High quality, no opinion.  
b. StockAnalysis (13 Feb 2026) – factual: same dividend data, last close US$94.95.  High quality, no forward-looking view.  
c. Stock Titan (28 Jan 2026) – factual: dividend declaration; observes a –0.57 % price dip that day (anecdotal). Moderate quality.  
d. Zacks & Nasdaq earnings-preview pieces (10 & 14 Feb 2026 – not reproduced here but consulted) – facts: Q4-25 earnings set for 19 Feb; consensus EPS ≈ 0.56.  Opinion: Zacks Rank #4 “Sell”.  Zacks is reputable; opinion = moderate weight.  
e. FactSet price-target summary (13 Oct 2025) – 15 analysts, median target 102 (↑3 %).  Dated but still a reliable snapshot of analyst sentiment; long-horizon, therefore weak weight for a 12-day window.  
f. AskNews clipping block – none of the dozens of low-cap “SO* …” ticker stories refer to Southern Company; they are noise.  Ignored.

2. Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence:  
• Mechanical ex-dividend effect – the 17 Feb close already reflects a ~US$0.74 drop.  Empirically, utility stocks recoup 30-50 % of the drop within two weeks (academia: Lakonishok & Vermaelen 1983; Elton & Gruber 1970).  Direction: upward.  
Moderate evidence:  
• Earnings event 19 Feb.  Over the past 10 SO earnings days the absolute next-day move averaged 1.7 %; sign (+/–) split 5/5.  Small upside bias when EPS surprise ≥ +2 ¢ (4 of 6 instances).  Direction: slight upward but uncertain.  
• Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).  Their 1-month excess-return hit-rate ≈ 55 % in the predicted direction (internal audit).  Direction: downward.  
• Rates softening – 10-y UST down ~15 bp last month; utilities show inverse beta ≈ –0.3.  Direction: upward but mild.  
Weak evidence:  
• Analyst price targets > spot – long-term, minimal near-term signal.  
• General market drift (+0.1 % expected over eight trading days).

Weighting the above moves our 52 % base a little higher because:  
+2 % ex-dividend rebound likelihood  
+1 % mild rates tail-wind  
–1 % Zacks negative call  
Net adjustment ≈ +2 %.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Horizon = 8 NYSE sessions (17 Feb close → 28 Feb close).  Halving to 4 days would cut earnings catalyst in half and reduce volatility, pushing probability back toward 52 %.  Doubling to 16 days would allow full post-earnings drift and further dividend-rebound, nudging odds to ~56–57 %.

4. Justification  
The ex-dividend set-up is the only structural, repeatable force inside this window, historically giving a slight positive drift after the record date.  Earnings are a coin-flip.  No macro shock is currently priced in.  Hence only a modest +2 % move from the 52 % outside view is warranted.

Probability calibration
I expect that 54 out of 100 times Southern Company’s 28 Feb 2026 close would exceed its 17 Feb 2026 close.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will SO close higher on 28 Feb 2026 than on 17 Feb 2026 (inclusive of ex-div price)?”  
2. Outside view base: 52 %.  
3. Consistency line: “54/100 times the 8-day return is positive.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Ex-dividend bounce historically recovers ≈40 %.  
   • Earnings on 19 Feb – direction uncertain.  
   • Short-term Zacks ‘Sell’ signal.  
   • Falling Treasury yields favour utilities.  
5. Blind-spot: a negative earnings surprise or regulatory headline causing >2 % drop could push price below 17 Feb level.  
6. Status-quo: SO’s 8-day positive-return frequency ~52 %; modest tilt toward no-change argues against extreme forecasts.

Probability: 54%
