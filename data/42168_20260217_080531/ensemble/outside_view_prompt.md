- **Ex-dividend date:** February 17, 2026
- **Payment date:** March 06, 2026
- **Current dividend yield:** 3.12%
- **Annual dividend:** $2.96 per share

## Relevance to Forecasting Question:

This article confirms that February 17, 2026 is an ex-dividend date for SO. Stocks typically experience a price drop on the ex-dividend date approximately equal to the dividend amount ($0.74 in this case), as buyers on or after this date are not entitled to the upcoming dividend payment. This is a mechanical market effect that could impact the comparison between the February 17, 2026 close price and the February 28, 2026 close price.

</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve SO daily closes for last 5 years to 2026-02-16 and calculate distribution of 9-day returns; give probability of positive return.
Objective recapped The assignment requires (1) a complete set of Southern Company (SO) daily closing prices for the five-year period ending 2026-02-16, (2) calculation of every 9-trading-day return over that horizon, and (3) the empirical probability that a 9-day holding period produces a positive return.

What we already have 1. Current/benchmark closes  
   • 2026-02-16 close used in the forecasting question: 94.95 USD (Yahoo Finance live quote page, first result).  
   • Macrotrends confirms the same latest close and provides five-year extrema—low 47.44 (pandemic trough) and high 98.91 (2025-10-15)—as well as annual averages (Macrotrends historical table).

2. Limited recent daily data  
   • The yFinance block supplies the last 10 trading days of OHLCV data, but that covers only 2026-02-02 through 2026-02-13—far short of the five-year window.

3. Context for price behaviour  
   • Five-year mean and standard deviation: mean 69.66 USD; range 47.44–98.91 (yFinance aggregation).  
   • One-year mean and standard deviation: mean 89.82 USD; σ ≈ 3.08 USD, indicating the very low day-to-day volatility typical of regulated utilities (yFinance).  
   • Beta over five years: 0.45, underscoring the stock’s defensive profile (Yahoo Finance quote page).  

Information still missing (critical gap) To compute a distribution of 9-day returns we must have a vector of daily closing prices extending back to 2021-02-17 (five calendar years before the evaluation period). The search results do not yet provide that full series in tabular form—only the most recent ten closes and annual summary lines. Without the complete price series the 9-day return distribution and the exact probability of a positive 9-day return cannot be produced.

Required additional data • All trading-day closing prices for SO from 2021-02-17 through 2026-02-16 inclusive (approximately 1,256 observations).  
• Once retrieved, rolling 9-day simple returns would be computed as (P_t / P_{t-9}) − 1 for each t from 2021-03-02 onward, yielding roughly 1,247 return observations.  
• Probability of a positive 9-day return = (count of returns > 0) / (total number of returns).

Recommended next search (not yet run) A direct Yahoo Finance API pull or yfinance Python call (“SO”, period = “5y”, interval = “1d”) will supply the needed closes in one step; alternatively a query such as SO daily close prices csv (Google) will surface downloadable .csv files.

Conclusion All contextual price statistics are assembled, but the core time-series dataset necessary for the 9-day return distribution remains to be fetched. Once the daily close vector is obtained, the computation is straightforward: derive ~1,247 overlapping 9-day returns and tally the fraction that are positive to provide the requested probability measure.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
