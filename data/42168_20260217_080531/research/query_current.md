Analysis:
We need very up-to-date information that could move Southern Company’s share price between 17 Feb 2026 and 28 Feb 2026. The most relevant items are: (1) any just-released or upcoming earnings/disclosure materials, (2) dividend declaration or ex-dividend date (a post-17 Feb ex-dividend would likely create a price drop equal to the dividend), (3) analyst rating changes or large-scale utility sector news (rate cases, regulatory rulings, interest-rate outlook). Therefore our searches should target: precise ex-dividend timing, immediate post-earnings commentary, and very recent analyst/regulatory news coverage.
