Analysis:
The question concerns a very short horizon (nine trading days). The main historical context that can improve a base‐rate estimate is:
• How SO typically moves over nine-day windows (frequency and magnitude of positive vs. negative returns).  
• Any regularly scheduled catalysts inside the window (earnings release, ex-dividend date, rate decisions).  
• Sector-wide influences such as interest-rate sensitivity of utilities; recent Treasury-yield behavior is therefore relevant.
