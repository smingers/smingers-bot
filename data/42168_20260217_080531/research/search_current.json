CAS will be implemented in a phased manner, initially for securities with derivatives, and will run for 20 minutes from 3:15 p.m. to 3:35 p.m. on trading days, with random closure of the order entry phase between 3:28 p.m. and 3:30 p.m. The closing price will be determined using an equilibrium price mechanism within a \u00b13% band from a reference price, which is based on the VWAP from 3:00 p.m. to 3:15 p.m. or the Last Traded Price (LTP) if no trades occurred. Only market and limit orders are permitted; stop-loss and iceberg orders are barred. Unexecuted limit orders from continuous trading will roll into CAS with higher time priority. The equilibrium price is defined as the price that maximizes executable volume, with tiebreakers based on minimum unmatched quantity and proximity to the reference price. Market orders take priority over limit orders. The CAS framework will be implemented from August 3, 2026, with the pre-open auction session framework aligned to CAS principles effective September 7, 2026. SEBI also mandates that stock exchanges and clearing corporations develop Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs) within 30 days to align derivative settlement prices and price bands with CAS. The move aims to enhance price discovery, investor confidence, and market integrity by ensuring a fair, transparent, and manipulation-resistant closing price, particularly critical for derivatives settlement, index computation, and mutual fund NAVs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 19, 2026 12:41 PM\nSource:[Tax Guru](https://taxguru.in/sebi/equity-market-closing-prices-set-auction-mechanism-sebi.html)\n\n**Sojitz Stock: Rally with a Warning Sign**\nThe Sojitz stock has shown strong performance since the beginning of the year, trading at 32.80 EUR as of mid-January 2026, unchanged from the previous day but up approximately 23% month-to-date and over 68% year-to-date. On a 12-month basis, the stock has risen by more than two-thirds. The company is set to release its Q3 2025 financial results on February 3, 2026, and despite the upcoming earnings report, the stock has remained remarkably stable\u2014suggesting either positive market expectations or investor caution awaiting further catalysts. Five out of eight analysts recommend holding the stock, three rate it as above-average or buyable, and no analysts recommend selling, resulting in a consensus 'Outperform' rating. However, the wide range of price targets\u2014between 4,000 and 6,100 JPY\u2014indicates uncertainty, with an average target of 5,022.50 JPY, about 17% below the current closing price, signaling potential short-term consolidation. Fundamentally, the stock appears attractively valued: the forward P/E ratio for 2026 is approximately 11, the P/S ratio is 0.27, and the P/CF ratio is -0.41, indicating an unusual operational situation. The stock remains just below its 52-week high, a level where profit-taking is common. Long-term investors will assess whether the upcoming earnings report justifies the rally, as the results are expected to be the decisive test for the recent surge. The current analysis from January 18, 2026, suggests urgent action is needed for shareholders, but it remains unclear whether an entry or exit is advisable.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: January 18, 2026 08:48 AM\nSource:[Aktien Check](https://www.aktiencheck.de/news/Artikel-Sojitz_Aktie_Aufstieg_Ansage-19380793)\n\n**SoFi Slides as 54.5M-Share Offering Tests Valuation After a Strong 2025 Rally | Investing.com ZA**\nSoFi Technologies (NASDAQ:SOFI) announced a $1.5 billion common stock offering on December 5, 2025, pricing 54,545,454 shares at $27.50 each\u20147% below its prior closing price of $29.60. The offering, led by Goldman Sachs with underwriters including BofA Securities, Citigroup, Deutsche Bank Securities, and Mizuho Securities, triggered a 7.30% premarket decline to $27.44, reflecting investor concerns over share dilution. The company retains a 30-day option to sell an additional 8,181,818 shares, potentially increasing total proceeds. The offering is expected to close on December 8, 2025, and proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes, including strengthening capital position and funding growth. This move follows a 92.2% year-to-date rally in 2025 and a more than sixfold increase since the end of 2022, raising SoFi\u2019s market cap to approximately $35.7 billion. Despite the pullback, SoFi reported strong Q3 results: revenue rose 38% YoY to $961.6 million, net income more than doubled to $139.4 million, and the company held $3.25 billion in cash and equivalents. With diluted EPS of $0.56 and a 19.46% profit margin, SoFi has transitioned to profitability. The platform serves over 12.6 million members and recently launched SoFi Crypto, becoming the first FDIC-insured, nationally chartered bank to offer crypto trading (Bitcoin, Ethereum, Solana) via its app. Analysts remain cautiously optimistic, noting SoFi\u2019s potential inclusion in the S&P 500 during December\u2019s rebalancing, which could drive additional demand. However, the stock trades at a P/E of 52.86, with an average analyst price target of $26.97, indicating valuation concerns.
