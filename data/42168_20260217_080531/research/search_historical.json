This is a mechanical market effect that could impact the comparison between the February 17, 2026 close price and the February 28, 2026 close price.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://finviz.com/news/309396/southern-co-so-earnings-expected-to-grow-what-to-know-ahead-of-next-weeks-release\">\n# Summary of Article: Southern Co.

Current/benchmark closes  \n   \u2022 2026-02-16 close used in the forecasting question: 94.95 USD (Yahoo Finance live quote page, first result).  \n   \u2022 Macrotrends confirms the same latest close and provides five-year extrema\u2014low 47.44 (pandemic trough) and high 98.91 (2025-10-15)\u2014as well as annual averages (Macrotrends historical table).\n\n2. Limited recent daily data  \n   \u2022 The yFinance block supplies the last 10 trading days of OHLCV data, but that covers only 2026-02-02 through 2026-02-13\u2014far short of the five-year window.\n\n3. Context for price behaviour  \n   \u2022 Five-year mean and standard deviation: mean 69.66 USD; range 47.44\u201398.91 (yFinance aggregation).  \n   \u2022 One-year mean and standard deviation: mean 89.82 USD; \u03c3 \u2248 3.08 USD, indicating the very low day-to-day volatility typical of regulated utilities (yFinance).  \n   \u2022 Beta over five years: 0.45, underscoring the stock\u2019s defensive profile (Yahoo Finance quote page).  \n\nInformation still missing (critical gap)\u2028To compute a distribution of 9-day returns we must have a vector of daily closing prices extending back to 2021-02-17 (five calendar years before the evaluation period). The search results do not yet provide that full series in tabular form\u2014only the most recent ten closes and annual summary lines. Without the complete price series the 9-day return distribution and the exact probability of a positive 9-day return cannot be produced.\n\nRequired additional data\u2028\u2022 All trading-day closing prices for SO from 2021-02-17 through 2026-02-16 inclusive (approximately 1,256 observations).  \n\u2022 Once retrieved, rolling 9-day simple returns would be computed as (P_t / P_{t-9}) \u2212 1 for each t from 2021-03-02 onward, yielding roughly 1,247 return observations.  \n\u2022 Probability of a positive 9-day return = (count of returns > 0) / (total number of returns).\n\nRecommended next search (not yet run)\u2028A direct Yahoo Finance API pull or yfinance Python call (\u201cSO\u201d, period = \u201c5y\u201d, interval = \u201c1d\u201d) will supply the needed closes in one step; alternatively a query such as SO daily close prices csv (Google) will surface downloadable .csv files.\n\nConclusion\u2028All contextual price statistics are assembled, but the core time-series dataset necessary for the 9-day return distribution remains to be fetched. Once the daily close vector is obtained, the computation is straightforward: derive ~1,247 overlapping 9-day returns and tally the fraction that are positive to provide the requested probability measure.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"DGS10\" query=\"10-year treasury constant maturity\">\nFRED Economic Data: Market Yield on U.S. Treasury Securities at 10-Year Constant Maturity, Quoted on an Investment Basis\nSeries ID: DGS10\nUnits: Percent\nFrequency: Daily\nLatest observation: 4.09 (2026-02-12)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=4.25, min=3.97, max=4.62\n- 5-year: mean=3.44, min=1.19, max=4.98\n- 10-year: mean=2.72, min=0.52, max=4.98\n- All-time: mean=5.82, min=0.52, max=15.84 (since 1962-01-02)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: -0.09 (-2.2%)\n- 3-month change: -0.05 (-1.2%)\n- 6-month change: -0.24 (-5.5%)\n- Year-over-year: 4.09 vs 4.62 (-11.5%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-28,4.26\n2026-01-29,4.24\n2026-01-30,4.26\n2026-02-02,4.29\n2026-02-03,4.28\n2026-02-04,4.29\n2026-02-05,4.21\n2026-02-06,4.22\n2026-02-09,4.22\n2026-02-10,4.16\n2026-02-11,4.18\n2026-02-12,4.09\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
