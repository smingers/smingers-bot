Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources on Robert Duvall's Death:**

1. **The Guardian (Feb 16, 2026)** - Peter Bradshaw's obituary. High-quality source, reputable international newspaper. Factual reporting of death at age 95. Explicitly mentions Duvall's role as "consigliere" Tom Hagen in The Godfather. Published one day before forecast period begins.

2. **CNN (Feb 16, 2026)** - Major news outlet reporting death at age 95. Factual information from wife Luciana via PR agency. Prominently features "consigliere" role multiple times. High credibility.

3. **IMDb (Feb 16, 2026)** - Entertainment industry source. Describes Duvall as "titan in American cinema" and mentions "consigliere" role. Moderate credibility with disclaimer about content accuracy.

4. **Tivyside Advertiser (Feb 17, 2026)** - UK regional newspaper. Factual death report, mentions "Mafia consigliere Tom Hagen" explicitly. Published on first day of forecast period.

5. **EntertainmentNow (Feb 16, 2026)** - Contains celebrity tributes from Jamie Lee Curtis ("The greatest consigliere the screen has ever seen") and Queen Latifah. These are identifiable expert opinions from industry peers who explicitly use the term "consigliere."

6. **Cinema Express (Feb 17, 2026)** - Article about Duvall refusing Godfather Part III, focusing on "consigliere" role. Published on forecast start date, continuing news cycle.

7. **Al Jazeera (Feb 16, 2026)** - Major international news outlet. High-quality factual reporting emphasizing Tom Hagen as "consigliere to the Corleone Mafia family."

**Google Trends Data:**
- Feb 16: Value = 100 (peak)
- Feb 17: Value = 91 (already declining)
- 90-day baseline mean: 11.2
- Current spike is 8.1x baseline

**AskNews Articles:**
Most articles are irrelevant (Russian mortgage markets, French policy changes, Turkish loans, etc.). One relevant article mentions "consigliere" in Italian context about Palermo city councilor Natale Puma requesting service expansion - this is unrelated to the Duvall news cycle and represents normal baseline usage of the Italian word.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence for Decrease:**

1. **Already declining trajectory** - Value dropped from 100 to 91 in one day (Feb 16→17), demonstrating decay has begun. This is direct, measurable evidence from Google Trends itself.

2. **No scheduled follow-up events** - Agent Report confirms no film premieres, memorial services, legal cases, or political events using "consigliere" between Feb 17-27. This is a structural factor: without new catalysts, news-driven spikes decay.

3. **Extreme elevation above baseline** - Current value (91) is 8.1x the 90-day mean (11.2). This represents massive mean reversion pressure, a well-established statistical phenomenon.

4. **Celebrity death news cycle pattern** - Historical reference class shows these spikes decay rapidly after 3-5 days. By day 12 (Feb 27), return toward baseline is typical. Multiple independent sources (Guardian, CNN, Al Jazeera) all published Feb 16, meaning peak coverage has passed.

**Moderate Evidence:**

1. **Celebrity tributes using "consigliere"** - Jamie Lee Curtis and Queen Latifah explicitly used the term in tributes. This extends the news cycle slightly but doesn't create sustained interest beyond 2-3 days.

2. **Multiple obituary articles** - 7+ major outlets covered the story, all mentioning "consigliere." This confirms the spike's magnitude but also suggests saturation - most interested parties have already searched.

**Weak Evidence:**

1. **Cinema Express retrospective (Feb 17)** - Continues coverage but represents tail-end analysis rather than breaking news. Unlikely to drive new searches.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 10 days (Feb 17 to Feb 27, 2026)

**Current position:** Day 2 of news cycle (death announced Feb 16, forecast starts Feb 17)

**If timeframe were halved (5 days, Feb 17→22):**
- Would increase probability of "Doesn't change" from ~12% to ~25-30%
- News cycle would still be active, value might remain in 70-90 range
- Decrease probability would drop to ~60-65%

**If timeframe were doubled (20 days, Feb 17→Mar 9):**
- Would increase probability of "Decreases" to ~95%
- By day 24 post-death, almost certain return to baseline (~11-20 range)
- "Doesn't change" probability would drop to ~3-5%

The 10-day window is long enough for substantial decay but short enough that some residual elevation might persist if there were ongoing catalysts (there aren't any).

## (d) Justification for Shifting Outside View

**Outside view base rates:**
- Decreases: 83%
- Doesn't change: 12%
- Increases: 5%

**Key factors warranting adjustment:**

1. **Confirmed single-catalyst event** - The Agent Report's finding that no additional events will generate "consigliere" headlines is crucial. This eliminates the main scenario that could sustain elevated interest.

2. **Already declining on Day 1** - The drop from 100 to 91 is faster than typical celebrity death cycles, suggesting particularly rapid decay. This warrants increasing "Decreases" probability.

3. **Extreme starting elevation** - At 8.1x baseline, the current spike is in the top 1% of historical values. Such extreme deviations have strong mean reversion.

4. **Resolution criteria specifics** - The question asks if Feb 27 value will be within 3 points of Feb 17 value (91). For "Doesn't change," we need the value to land in 88-94 range. Given 10 days of decay from an 8x-elevated spike, this narrow band is unlikely.

**Mathematical projection:**
- Conservative daily decay: 5 points/day → Value on Feb 27 = 91 - (5×10) = 41
- Moderate daily decay: 7 points/day → Value on Feb 27 = 91 - (7×10) = 21
- Aggressive decay: 10 points/day → Value on Feb 27 = 91 - (10×10) = -9 (floors at baseline ~11)

Even the most conservative decay scenario puts us well below 88, triggering "Decreases."

**Adjustment rationale:**
The outside view already heavily favored "Decreases" (83%). The inside view evidence strengthens this further:
- Already declining trajectory adds +3-5% confidence
- No follow-up events adds +2-3% confidence
- Extreme elevation adds +2-3% confidence

However, I must consider potential upsets:
- Unexpected memorial service announcement (low probability, ~2%)
- Viral social media trend around Godfather clips (low probability, ~3%)
- Documentary or tribute special announcement (very low, ~1%)

These scenarios could sustain interest but are unlikely given no scheduled events.

## Probability Calibration

**Status quo outcome:** If nothing changes in the news cycle, the value will continue decaying toward baseline. The "status quo" is decay, not stability.

**Distribution calibration:**

Starting from outside view (Decreases: 83%, Doesn't change: 12%, Increases: 5%), I adjust based on inside evidence:

**Increases (>94):** 
- Requires new catalyst or viral trend
- No scheduled events found
- Celebrity tributes already published
- Probability: 3% (down from 5% due to confirmed lack of events)

**Doesn't change (88-94):**
- Requires value to decline by only 0-3 points over 10 days
- Would need sustained interest without new catalysts
- Already dropped 9 points in one day
- For this to occur, decay must essentially halt after Day 1
- Probability: 8% (down from 12% due to fast initial decay)

**Decreases (<88):**
- Consistent with all evidence: declining trajectory, no catalysts, extreme elevation, typical news cycle pattern
- Even conservative decay models predict values in 20-60 range by Feb 27
- Probability: 89% (up from 83% due to confirming evidence)

**Calibration check:** 
- At 89%, I'm saying there's roughly 8:1 odds of decrease vs. other outcomes combined
- This feels appropriate given: (a) already declining, (b) no new events, (c) 10 days is long for news cycle, (d) 8x elevation above baseline
- A 99% confidence would require near-certainty, but I acknowledge small probability of unexpected memorial service or viral trend
- An 80% confidence would underweight the strong structural factors (no catalysts, mean reversion)

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Google Trends value for "consigliere" on Feb 27 be >3 points higher, within 3 points, or >3 points lower than Feb 17 value (91)?

2. **Base rate:** Outside view was Decreases: 83%, Doesn't change: 12%, Increases: 5%. Final prediction maintains this directional emphasis with slight strengthening toward Decreases.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = Decreases (89%); Least likely = Increases (3%). This aligns with evidence: news-driven spike decaying without new catalysts over 10 days.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - Value already dropped 100→91 in one day (factual, from Google Trends)
   - No scheduled events Feb 17-27 using "consigliere" (Agent Report finding)
   - Current value 8.1x baseline creates strong mean reversion pressure (statistical)
   - Celebrity death news cycles typically decay within 7-10 days (historical pattern)
   - Multiple major outlets already published obituaries Feb 16 (saturation)

5. **Blind spot:** Unexpected announcement of major memorial service or tribute special (e.g., TCM marathon, documentary premiere) between Feb 18-26 could sustain elevated interest. This would make "Doesn't change" or even "Increases" more likely. Probability of this: ~5-8%.

6. **Status quo:** The status quo IS decay. The world changes slowly, but news cycles change quickly. Given we're in an active decay phase, the status quo outcome is "Decreases."

7. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, are between 0-100, no % signs.
