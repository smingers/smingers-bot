Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

**Tivyside Advertiser (Feb 17, 2026)**: Reports Robert Duvall's death at age 95 on February 16, 2026. This is a factual news report from a UK regional newspaper. The article explicitly mentions Duvall's role as "Mafia consigliere Tom Hagen" in The Godfather films. The timing is critical—this occurred one day before the forecasting period begins.

**EntertainmentNow (Feb 16, 2026)**: Reports Duvall's death on February 15, 2026 (note: slight date discrepancy with other sources, likely due to announcement timing). Contains factual tributes from Jamie Lee Curtis ("The greatest consigliere the screen has ever seen") and Queen Latifah ("the best consigliere for the Corleone family"). These celebrity tributes explicitly use the term "consigliere," which would drive search interest.

**Cinema Express (Feb 17, 2026)**: Discusses why Duvall refused The Godfather Part III, focusing on his "consigliere" role. Published on the first day of the forecasting period, this article continues the news cycle around Duvall's death and his iconic role.

**Al Jazeera (Feb 16, 2026)**: Major international news outlet reporting Duvall's death, emphasizing his role as "Tom Hagen, the consigliere to the Corleone Mafia family." High-quality, factual reporting from a reputable source.

**Spike Art Magazine**: Cultural article about an Urbit conference that mentions "consigliere" once in passing (Charlotte Fang "flanked by consigliere"). Not relevant to the current news cycle.

**Agent Report**: Comprehensive search for scheduled events Feb 17-27, 2026. Key finding: Robert Duvall's death on Feb 16 is the ONLY identified catalyst for "consigliere" headlines in this period. No film premieres, legal cases, or political events are scheduled that would use the term. The report concludes that "intensity of searches for 'consigliere' is likely to decay rather than rise between 17 and 27 Feb."

**Google Trends Data**: Shows current value of 91 on Feb 17, down from 100 on Feb 16. The 90-day mean is 11.2, indicating the current spike is approximately 8x the baseline. Historical pattern shows 41% of 10-day windows have ≤3 point changes, 31% increase >3 points, 28% decrease >3 points.

(b) Reference class analysis:

**Possible reference classes:**
1. Celebrity death news cycles and associated search term decay
2. Historical 10-day changes in "consigliere" Google Trends
3. News-driven spikes in niche terminology search interest

**Most suitable reference class**: Celebrity death news cycles for iconic roles with specific terminology. When a major actor dies and their most famous role involves a distinctive term (like "consigliere"), search interest typically:
- Spikes immediately upon death announcement (Feb 16: value 100)
- Remains elevated for 1-3 days as obituaries circulate
- Decays rapidly after 3-5 days as the news cycle moves on
- Returns toward baseline within 7-10 days

The Google Trends data supports this pattern: the value already dropped from 100 to 91 in one day (Feb 16→17).

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Prediction timeframe**: 10 days (Feb 17 to Feb 27, 2026)

**Key dates:**
- Feb 16: Death announced, value = 100
- Feb 17 (today): Value = 91 (already declining)
- Feb 27: Resolution date (10 days from now)

**Historical patterns:**
- Baseline for "consigliere": ~11.2 (90-day mean)
- Current value: 91 (8.1x baseline)
- The spike is entirely news-driven with no scheduled follow-up events

**Typical celebrity death news cycle:**
- Days 1-2: Peak coverage (obituaries, tributes)
- Days 3-5: Extended coverage (retrospectives, analysis)
- Days 6-10: Rapid decay toward baseline
- By day 10-14: Near baseline unless memorial service or other event

Given that Feb 17 is already Day 2 of the news cycle, by Feb 27 (Day 12), we would expect substantial decay.

(d) Justification:

The outside view strongly suggests a decrease. Here's why:

1. **Single catalyst exhaustion**: The Agent Report confirms no additional scheduled events will generate "consigliere" headlines between Feb 17-27. The Duvall death is a one-time shock.

2. **Already declining**: The value dropped from 100 to 91 in just one day, indicating the decay process has begun.

3. **Mean reversion pressure**: At 91, the current value is 8x the 90-day baseline of 11.2. Without new catalysts, strong mean reversion is expected.

4. **News cycle dynamics**: Celebrity death stories typically have 3-5 day half-lives. By Feb 27 (12 days post-death), most casual searchers will have moved on.

5. **Mathematical expectation**: If we assume exponential decay from 91 toward baseline 11.2 over 10 days, even a conservative decay rate would bring the value well below 88 (91-3) by Feb 27.

6. **Historical base rates**: While 41% of 10-day windows show ≤3 point changes, those windows typically start from baseline values (~11), not from 8x-elevated spike values. Starting from an extreme spike makes decrease far more likely.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate analysis shows 28% of 10-day windows decrease by >3 points, but this is calculated across all conditions, including stable baseline periods. When starting from a news-driven spike (91 vs baseline 11.2), the probability of decrease is much higher.

**Key calibration factors:**

1. **Asymmetric starting position**: We're starting at 91, far above baseline. The question asks if the value on Feb 27 will be within 3 points (88-94), above 94, or below 88.

2. **Decay trajectory**: Even modest daily decay of 5-7 points would bring us to ~40-60 by Feb 27, well below 88.

3. **Probability of staying elevated**: For "Doesn't change" (88-94 range), we'd need the value to decline by only 0-3 points over 10 days. This requires sustained interest without new catalysts—highly unlikely.

4. **Probability of increase**: For "Increases" (>94), we'd need new catalysts or sustained viral interest. The Agent Report found none, making this very unlikely (<5%).

5. **Historical upset rate**: In celebrity death news cycles, the typical pattern is consistent decay. Upsets (sustained or increased interest) occur only with: memorial services, documentary releases, or scandal revelations. None are scheduled.

**Probability distribution reasoning:**
- Decreases (value <88 on Feb 27): 80-85%
- Doesn't change (value 88-94): 10-15%  
- Increases (value >94): 5%

Given the strong evidence for decay and lack of countervailing catalysts, I'll weight heavily toward "Decreases."

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 5%
Doesn't change: 12%
Decreases: 83%
