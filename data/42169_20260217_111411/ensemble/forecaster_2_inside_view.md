Analysis:

**1. Paraphrase of Resolution Criteria**
Question asks whether Google Trends value for "consigliere" on Feb 27, 2026 will be >3 higher (Increases), within ±3 (Doesn't change), or >3 lower (Decreases) compared to Feb 17, 2026. Current value Feb 17 is 91 (per outside view); baseline is 100 on Feb 16.

**2. Source Analysis**

*Primary news sources (Robert Duvall death):*
- **The Guardian** (Feb 16, 2026): High-quality obituary explicitly mentioning Duvall's "consigliere" role in The Godfather. Reliable, factual. Published day before forecast window.
- **CNN** (Feb 16, 2026): Major news outlet, comprehensive obituary prominently featuring the "consigliere" role. Highly reliable, factual.
- **IMDb** (Feb 16, 2026): Entertainment database obituary mentioning "consigliere." Moderate reliability for news, but factual on film roles.

All three independent sources confirm Robert Duvall died Feb 15-16, 2026, and all explicitly reference his iconic "consigliere" role in The Godfather—this is **strong evidence** for a spike in searches around Feb 16.

*AskNews articles:*
Most AskNews articles are irrelevant (Russian mortgages, French policy changes, Turkish loans, etc.). The only potentially relevant piece:
- **WordStream marketing predictions** (Feb 16, 2026): Generic marketing analysis; no connection to "consigliere." Not relevant.

*Google Trends data:*
The outside view analysis states current value is 91 on Feb 17, with a 30-day peak of 100 on Feb 16. This is **strong factual evidence** that the spike has already occurred and is beginning to decay.

**3. Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- Robert Duvall's death (Feb 15-16) caused an immediate spike to 100 on Feb 16, now at 91 on Feb 17—a clear causal mechanism linking celebrity death → obituary coverage → search spike for signature role term
- Starting position of 91 is in the 91st percentile of the 0-100 scale, mechanically constraining upward movement while allowing large downward swings
- Historical pattern: celebrity-death-driven search spikes typically decay within 3-7 days as news cycle moves on

**Moderate evidence:**
- No scheduled events, film releases, or other catalysts identified between Feb 17-27 that would sustain or increase interest
- The 90-day historical base rate shows 28% decrease probability under normal conditions; current high-start position amplifies this

**Weak evidence:**
- Possibility of delayed secondary coverage (retrospectives, tributes) could sustain interest, but no concrete evidence of such planned content

**4. Timeframe Analysis**

Prediction window: 10 days (Feb 17-27, 2026).

The critical dynamic is **spike decay velocity**. Typical celebrity-death search spikes:
- Peak: Day 0-1 (Feb 15-16) ✓ Already occurred
- Rapid decay: Days 2-4 (Feb 17-19)
- Slow decay: Days 5-10 (Feb 20-25)
- Stabilization: Days 10+ (Feb 26+)

If timeframe were **halved to 5 days** (Feb 17-22): Would increase "Decreases" probability to ~70% as we'd capture only the rapid-decay phase.

If timeframe were **doubled to 20 days** (Feb 17-Mar 9): Would increase "Decreases" probability to ~75% as the value would almost certainly return to pre-spike baseline by then.

The 10-day window captures both rapid and slow decay phases, making "Decreases" highly likely but not certain.

**5. Justification for Adjusting Outside View**

The outside view base rates (↑15%, =30%, ↓55%) already incorporate a "high-start mean-reversion" adjustment. Current circumstances validate and potentially strengthen this adjustment:

**Factors supporting "Decreases" (>55%):**
- We are exactly 1 day post-peak; decay has demonstrably begun (100→91)
- No identified catalysts for Feb 17-27 to reverse or sustain the spike
- News cycle moves quickly; Duvall story will be displaced by newer events
- Historical pattern: search interest in actor-specific terms fades quickly after obituary cycle

**Factors supporting "Doesn't change" (~30%):**
- The ±3 threshold is relatively wide (88-94 range); value could stabilize in mid-80s
- Possible secondary coverage (memorial services, retrospectives) could provide minor support
- Some baseline interest in "consigliere" exists independent of Duvall

**Factors supporting "Increases" (<15%):**
- Would require new catalyst (major tribute event, film re-release announcement, viral social media moment)
- No evidence of such catalysts
- Mechanically difficult: value is already at 91; increasing >3 points means approaching or exceeding the fixed-range peak

**Calibration Logic:**
The outside view's 55% for "Decreases" appears conservative given:
1. We have direct evidence of decay already underway (100→91 in 24 hours)
2. The 10-day window is long enough for substantial further decay
3. Complete absence of sustaining catalysts

However, the ±3 threshold creates a buffer zone. If decay slows (common after initial rapid drop), the value could settle at 88-90, triggering "Doesn't change."

I will moderately increase "Decreases" to 60-65% and correspondingly reduce "Doesn't change" to 25-28%, while keeping "Increases" at 10-12%.

**Probability Calibration**

Starting from outside view: ↑15%, =30%, ↓55%

**Adjustments:**
- **Decreases:** Increase from 55% to 62%. Justification: Direct evidence of decay initiation, no countervailing catalysts, sufficient time for >3-point drop.
- **Doesn't change:** Decrease from 30% to 28%. Justification: The ±3 buffer is meaningful, but decay momentum makes stabilization within 88-94 range less likely than baseline.
- **Increases:** Decrease from 15% to 10%. Justification: No identified catalysts; mechanical constraints; would require unexpected viral moment or major tribute event.

**Final calibrated probabilities:**
- Increases: 10%
- Doesn't change: 28%
- Decreases: 62%

**Checklist:**

1. ✓ Options: Increases (>94), Doesn't change (88-94), Decreases (<88) by Feb 27 vs Feb 17 baseline of 91.

2. ✓ Outside view base: ↑15%, =30%, ↓55%. Final prediction (↑10%, =28%, ↓62%) remains anchored to this, with moderate shift justified by direct decay evidence.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = Decreases (62%); Least likely = Increases (10%). Makes sense: spike has peaked, decay underway, no new catalysts.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Duvall death caused spike to 100 on Feb 16; now 91 on Feb 17 (decay begun)
   - No scheduled events or catalysts identified for Feb 17-27
   - Historical pattern: celebrity-death spikes decay within 3-7 days
   - Starting at 91 mechanically constrains upward movement
   - 10-day window sufficient for >3-point decay but ±3 buffer allows stabilization

5. **Blind spot:** Unexpected major tribute event (nationally televised memorial, Godfather re-release announcement, viral social media campaign) could sustain or increase interest. Probability ~10-15%. Would shift distribution to ↑25%, =35%, ↓40%.

6. **Status quo:** Current trajectory is downward (100→91). Continuing this trend for 10 days strongly favors "Decreases." Low volatility expected absent new catalyst. No adjustment needed.

7. ✓ Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [10, 28, 62]
