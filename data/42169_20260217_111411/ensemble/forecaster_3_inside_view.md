Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria / options (paraphrase, <30 words)  
Compare US Google Trends “consigliere” values on 2026-02-17 vs 2026-02-27 (fixed 2026-01-28 to 2026-02-27 chart). +>3 = Increases; within ±3 = Doesn’t change; ->3 = Decreases.

(a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; date)
- The Guardian (2026-02-16): Obituary for Robert Duvall, explicitly references his role as the Corleone family “consigliere” in *The Godfather*. High-quality major outlet; published one day before window starts; factual death news + interpretive commentary on his acting.
- CNN (2026-02-16): Death announcement/retrospective; explicitly says he played the Corleone “consigliere” Tom Hagen. High-quality; timely; mostly factual biography and career recap.
- IMDb news page (2026-02-16): Syndicated/aggregated entertainment news noting Duvall’s death and “consigliere” role. Medium quality (aggregation; less editorial control), but consistent with major outlets on key facts.
- AskNews: PalermoToday (2026-02-16): Italian local story quoting a city “consigliere” (councilor). Real-world usage of the word, but (i) not US-focused and (ii) meaning differs (political councilor vs mafia adviser), so weak relevance to US Google searches for the term.
- Other AskNews items (Russia mortgages, marketing predictions, etc.): Not meaningfully connected to “consigliere” searches in the US; essentially irrelevant.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution criteria)
Strong evidence
- Celebrity-death-driven spike already occurred just before the window (Duvall death widely covered on 2/16; multiple reliable outlets). Mechanism: people search “consigliere” after seeing it in obituaries/tributes. Typical pattern: sharp spike then decay over ~days.
- Structural/base-rate-like pattern for such spikes: absent a *new* catalyst, interest usually mean-reverts; sustaining within ±3 of a high post-spike value over 10 days is uncommon.

Moderate evidence
- Timing: the main catalyst is *before* the measurement window starts, so 2/17 is likely already on the downslope; by 2/27 (11 days post-announcement) the story is usually out of the news cycle.
- Fixed-date Trends URL reduces rescaling drift, so the observed change is more likely to reflect true interest decay rather than normalization artifacts (though a new late spike could still reset the 0–100 scale within the fixed range).

Weak evidence
- PalermoToday’s “consigliere” usage could add tiny background noise, but it’s not US-centric and the semantic context differs; unlikely to prevent a >3 drop from a high 2/17 level.
- Speculative possibilities (viral clip, streaming promotion, memorial announcement) without any sourced indication in the provided materials.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Window length: 10 days (from today, 2026-02-17, to 2026-02-27).  
- If halved (~5 days to 2/22): “Doesn’t change” becomes somewhat more plausible because death-news afterglow can linger several days.  
- If doubled (~20 days): “Decreases” becomes even more likely as the news shock further dissipates toward baseline.

(d) Justification (how inside view updates outside view)
Outside view base rates previously established: Increases 5 / Doesn’t change 10 / Decreases 85.

Inside view adjustment:
- The provided sources strongly reinforce that the spike is tied to a single, time-bounded event (Duvall death) that occurred immediately before the window. That makes this case *more* like a classic post-shock decay than an average 10-day period in the historical reference class.  
- No provided evidence of an upcoming second catalyst near 2/27 that could re-accelerate searches. Given the ±3 criterion, even mild decay implies “Decreases.”

Net: slightly *reduce* “Increases” vs the outside view (already low), keep “Doesn’t change” low, and slightly *increase* “Decreases.”

Probability calibration
- Status quo continuation: post-obituary decay continues through the week(s), implying 2/27 < 2/17 by more than 3 points → “Decreases.”  
- Sensitivity: A ±10% shift would require credible signs of a second wave (e.g., major memorial/award-show mention) during 2/24–2/27; none are in the current info set.  
- Remaining uncertainty is mainly about how fast the decay is and whether there is a surprise late-cycle bump; both still usually yield “Decreases” rather than “Doesn’t change” or “Increases.”

Checklist:
1) Criteria/options check: compares 2/27 vs 2/17 on fixed 1/28–2/27 US chart; ±3 threshold; yes.  
2) Outside view base rate used: [5,10,85]; yes, anchored.  
3) Consistency check: Most likely = Decreases; least likely = Increases; aligned with decay narrative.  
4) Key evidence (<20 words each):
   - Multiple major outlets tie “consigliere” to Duvall death right before window.  
   - Celebrity-death search spikes typically decay sharply within ~1 week.  
   - No sourced indication of a second catalyst near 2/27.  
   - ±3 band is tight given expected decay from a post-spike level.  
5) Blind spot: a major viral/memorial/award-show moment late window causes a new peak and rescaling.  
6) Status quo: gradual attention decay dominates most of the time; supports Decreases.  
7) Technicalities: probabilities 0–100 integers; sum to 100.

Probabilities: [3, 8, 89]
