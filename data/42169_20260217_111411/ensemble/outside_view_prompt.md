You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “consigliere” change between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-27 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “consigliere” at the time of writing this question (Feb 16, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 100; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=consigliere&date=2026-01-17%202026-02-16).

`{"format":"trends_interest_change_magnitude","info":{"topic":"consigliere","trend_start":"2026-02-17","trend_end":"2026-02-27","verification_url":"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=consigliere&date=2026-01-28%202026-02-27"}}`

The options are: ['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves “Doesn't change” if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=consigliere&date=2026-01-28%202026-02-27](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=consigliere&date=2026-01-28%202026-02-27) for 2026-02-27 is within 3 of the value at 2026-02-17. It resolves “Increases” if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves “Decreases” if the value is more than 3 lower.

<Agent_report>
Query: Identify any entertainment premieres, legal cases, or political events scheduled 17–27 Feb 2026 that are likely to generate headlines explicitly using the word “consigliere”; list dates and brief description of each potential catalyst.
Summary of findings for 17 – 27 February 2026

After reviewing the available entertainment, legal-case, and political calendars, only one catalyst certain to drive English-language headlines that explicitly use the word “consigliere” has been identified for the target window, and even that catalyst is a spill-over from an event dated 16 February. No film, television, streaming, book, gaming, or music premiere scheduled between 17 and 27 February 2026 advertises or markets itself with the term “consigliere,” and no court docket, congressional calendar, or scheduled hearing in that span features a participant popularly labelled a “consigliere.”  

Confirmed or highly-probable headline catalyst

• 16 February 2026 (impact expected 17 – 20 February) – Death of Robert Duvall  
  – Variety and other outlets reported that actor Robert Duvall died at age 95 on 16 Feb 2026. Virtually every obituary foregrounds his Oscar-nominated turn as “Tom Hagen, the Corleone family’s consigliere, in The Godfather I & II.” (IMDb news wire recap, 16 Feb 2026; Variety obituary, cited therein). Because major papers, magazines, broadcast networks, and long-lead Sunday supplements customarily run appreciations and retrospectives in the days following a marquee actor’s death, continued coverage using the phrase “Corleone family consigliere” is very likely through at least the weekend of 22 Feb 2026.  

Items investigated but not qualifying

• O’Romeo injunction hearing, 6 Feb 2026 – The civil suit filed in Mumbai to block release of the gangster film O’Romeo (Film Information, 3 Feb 2026) had its key hearing on 6 Feb, outside the target window.

• TV & streaming premieres – February slates published by Drama Quarterly and IMDb for 1 – 27 Feb list no series whose log-line, episode titles, or promotional copy contain “consigliere.” Shows with organised-crime or spy themes (e.g., CIA on CBS, 23 Feb) use the terms “handler,” “case officer,” or “advisor,” not “consigliere.” (Drama Quarterly, Series to Watch Feb 2026).

• Film production news – Martin Scorsese’s untitled Hawaiian gangster film and John Woo’s Gambino biopic announced shoots or casting in 2026, but neither has a February 2026 release, trailer drop, or festival premiere. (Film Stories, 23 Apr 2025; Variety via IMDb, 13 Nov 2025).

• Political / legal usage – Current   Clinton–Epstein deposition negotiations (1News, 3 Feb 2026) and the ICE testimony probe (1News, 14 Feb 2026) have not generated press that brands any participant a “consigliere,” and no procedural milestone is scheduled 17 – 27 Feb 2026 that would plausibly introduce the term.

Assessment of interest-change potential

Because the only catalyst is Robert Duvall’s death—already reflected in Google Trends spiking the term to 100 on 16 Feb—the intensity of searches for “consigliere” is likely to decay rather than rise between 17 and 27 Feb. Without a fresh, date-specific stimulus, the Trends value on 27 Feb is more likely to fall by more than three points than to rise or hold steady.

Information gaps

No additional scheduled events containing the explicit keyword were found. A follow-up sweep of:
• “consigliere” + “press conference” Feb 2026  
• “consigliere” + “premiere” Feb 2026  
could confirm that no late-announced festival screenings or true-crime docuseries use the term in marketing copy, but current evidence suggests the list above is complete.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
