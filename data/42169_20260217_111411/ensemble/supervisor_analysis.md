Disagreement Analysis:

1. **Base rate assumptions for post-spike decay**: The most significant disagreement is between forecasters 1/3 (89% Decreases) and forecasters 2/4 (62-68% Decreases), with forecaster 5 in between at 78%. Forecasters 1 and 3 use aggressive base rates (83-85% for Decreases) while forecaster 4 starts from a much more conservative base rate (28% Decreases from a generic 10-day window analysis) and forecaster 2 uses 55%. This ~20+ percentage point spread in the Decreases probability is the largest disagreement and directly driven by different starting base rates for how often celebrity-death search spikes decay within 10 days.

2. **Probability of "Doesn't change" (stabilization in the 88-94 range)**: Forecasters 1/3 assign only 8% to this outcome, while forecaster 2 assigns 28% and forecaster 4 assigns 20%. The core question is whether the ±3 point buffer is wide enough to catch a scenario where interest decays slowly and remains in the low-to-mid 80s-90s range on Feb 27. Forecaster 4 explicitly notes that "value could hover in low-90s for several days" while forecasters 1/3 believe decay will be swift enough to blow past the ±3 band.

3. **Probability of "Increases"**: Forecasters 1/3 assign only 3% while forecaster 4 assigns 12% and forecaster 2 assigns 10%. The disagreement centers on whether a secondary catalyst (memorial, tribute broadcast, viral moment) could plausibly push interest above 94 on Feb 27. This is a smaller disagreement in absolute terms but still notable.

Root Causes:

1. **Base rate assumptions**: Different factual beliefs about how quickly celebrity-death search spikes decay. Forecasters 1/3 cite "78-83% historical drop rate" while forecaster 4 uses a generic 10-day window base rate of 28% Decreases. This is partly verifiable (historical Google Trends decay patterns) and partly a weighting difference.

2. **Stabilization probability**: Different weighting of the same evidence. All agree decay is likely, but disagree on the speed. The ±3 threshold interpretation is consistent across forecasters, but their models of decay velocity differ.

3. **Secondary catalyst probability**: Different subjective assessments of the likelihood of a memorial service, tribute broadcast, or viral moment for Robert Duvall in the Feb 17-27 window. This is partially verifiable via news searches.
