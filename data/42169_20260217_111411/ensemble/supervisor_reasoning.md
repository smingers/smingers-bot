Resolution of Disagreements:

1. **Secondary catalyst (memorial/tribute event)**: The research clearly resolved this disagreement. The Nottingham Post article explicitly states that **no official memorial service is planned per Robert Duvall's wishes**, and the family requested people simply watch a favorite film or share meals as tribute. The TCM/Godfather tribute search returned no results. This supports forecasters 1/3/5 who assigned low probability to a secondary catalyst, and weakens forecaster 2/4's higher "Increases" and "Doesn't change" probabilities that partially relied on the possibility of such events.

2. **Base rate for post-spike decay**: This was not directly resolved by the research, as we couldn't obtain the actual Google Trends daily values for the resolution window. However, the confirmation that there are no planned memorial events or tributes strengthens the case for rapid decay, supporting the higher "Decreases" estimates from forecasters 1/3/5.

3. **Stabilization probability**: The absence of any planned follow-up events (memorial, tribute broadcast, streaming event) makes it less likely that interest would stabilize in the 88-94 range for 10 days. This favors the lower "Doesn't change" estimates from forecasters 1/3 (8%) over forecaster 2 (28%) and forecaster 4 (20%).

Updated Analysis:

The key finding is that Robert Duvall's family explicitly stated no memorial service would be held, which eliminates the most plausible secondary catalyst that could sustain elevated search interest. Combined with:

- The spike is clearly tied to a single event (Duvall's death on Feb 15, announced Feb 16)
- Celebrity death search spikes historically decay within 3-7 days
- The starting value of ~91 is extremely elevated compared to the baseline (~13)
- No TCM tribute, streaming event, or other scheduled catalyst exists
- The 10-day window is more than sufficient for decay past the ±3 threshold

The weighted average of 77.2% for Decreases appears slightly low given the confirmed absence of secondary catalysts. I'll shift modestly toward the more aggressive forecasters (1/3/5) but not fully, as there remains genuine uncertainty about decay speed and the possibility of unexpected viral moments.

Adjustments from weighted average [7.4, 15.4, 77.2]:
- Decreases: Increase from 77.2% to ~82% (no memorial service confirmed, no events found)
- Doesn't change: Decrease from 15.4% to ~12% (sustained interest unlikely without catalysts)
- Increases: Decrease from 7.4% to ~6% (no secondary catalyst identified)

Confidence: MEDIUM

The research confirmed the absence of planned memorial events (resolving one key disagreement), but we couldn't obtain the actual current Google Trends values to verify the decay trajectory, and the base rate disagreement remains partially unresolved.

Probabilities: [6, 12, 82]
