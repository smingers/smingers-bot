</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: What is the current Google Trends interest level for "consigliere" in the US as of February 17, 2026? Has the value already started declining from the peak of 100 on February 16? Check the URL https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=consigliere&date=2026-01-28%202026-02-27 and report the most recent daily values available.
The information returned in the search results does not include the daily “interest over time” numbers that Google Trends reports for the search term “consigliere.” None of the articles, videos, or business-trend summaries quoted above provide the numeric, day-by-day values that appear on the Google Trends chart for the fixed period 2026-01-28 to 2026-02-27.  

Because the original forecasting question hinges on the exact figures for 2026-02-17 (today) and the immediately preceding and following days, the critical data elements that must be confirmed are:

1. The Google Trends value for 2026-02-17 (U.S., search term “consigliere,” time window 2026-01-28 – 2026-02-27).  
2. The values for the subsequent days now available (e.g., 2026-02-18, 2026-02-19, etc.) to determine whether the series has begun to decline from the peak of 100 recorded on 2026-02-16.  
3. Confirmation that 100 remains the highest value in the fixed-scale range and that the scaling has not been recalibrated since the snapshot cited in the prompt.

Without those numbers, it is impossible to state:

• today’s exact interest level;  
• whether the value has already dropped more than three points from 100;  
• the most recent daily trajectory needed for the “increase / decrease / no change” resolution rule.

Therefore, the essential quantitative evidence needed to answer the query—namely, the Google Trends daily values from the URL https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=consigliere&date=2026-01-28%202026-02-27—is still missing. A direct reading or screen capture of that Trends chart is required before a definitive answer can be given.

No other publicly accessible news or analytical source captured in the search results supplies that missing data.  

Conclusion: Additional information—the actual Google Trends daily values for “consigliere” spanning at least 2026-02-15 through the latest available date—is still needed to fulfill the original query.</Agent_report>
