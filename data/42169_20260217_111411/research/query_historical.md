Analysis:
The term “consigliere” normally spikes when a high-profile person is labeled a “consigliere” in political commentary, when Mafia-related court cases hit headlines, or when mob-themed entertainment (films, TV, video games, podcasts) is released. To gauge whether another spike is likely between 17 Feb and 27 Feb 2026, it helps to look for:
• Scheduled media releases or premieres during that window that feature the word.  
• Upcoming legal proceedings or news stories mentioning a Mafia consigliere.  
• Opinion pieces that might call an adviser (e.g., to Trump or another politician) a “consigliere,” especially with U.S. primary elections under way.  
Historical search interest patterns and any catalysts scheduled for late February 2026 will inform the baseline probability that the 17 Feb value (currently at 100 on the locked 30-day scale) will be exceeded or sharply fall.
