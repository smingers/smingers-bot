This decline is attributed to the implementation of new restrictions on family mortgages and anticipatory demand, as families rushed to apply before conditions changed. Meanwhile, demand for market-rate mortgages rose 10.3% month-on-month and 42.5% year-on-year. Despite a 36.2% drop in completed transactions in the primary market due to previously approved applications, the situation is slightly better than the decline in new applications. A key regulatory change effective 1 February required children to be registered with their parents at the same address, a challenge for families in rented housing. Family and subsidized mortgages have historically dominated the sector, with market-rate programs accounting for only 15\u201320% of loans in 2025. On 11 February 2026, President Vladimir Putin instructed the preparation of measures to allow families to transition between state mortgage programs based on the number of children and to introduce differentiated interest rates\u2014potentially increasing to 10% for one child, lowering to 4% for three, and maintaining 6% for two. Analysts, including Dr. of Economic Sciences Igor Nikolaev from the Institute of Economics of the Russian Academy of Sciences, identify two main causes for reduced demand: the narrowing of mortgage benefits and a significant slowdown in real wage growth\u2014rising only slightly over 4% in 2025, roughly half the pace of 2024. This slowdown limits citizens\u2019 purchasing power. While the key interest rate of 15.5% is not prohibitive, it remains a constraint, especially if wage growth does not recover. Market-rate mortgage demand is rising due to uncertainty over future conditions, fears of worsening subsidies, and rising rental prices\u2014projected to increase 10% in Moscow by the end of 2026. Consumers view mortgages as a form of asset protection, unlike rent, which is a sunk cost. The recent request by developer 'Samolet' for a 48\u201350 billion ruble state loan sparked concern, leading to a 7% drop in the company\u2019s shares on 4 February, though the overall decline by 12 February was about 12%. The market remains sensitive to sentiment, and negative expectations could dampen even market-rate mortgage activity. However, a broad negative trend has not yet materialized.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 05:50 AM\nSource:[\u0421\u0432\u043e\u0431\u043e\u0434\u043d\u0430\u044f \u041f\u0440\u0435\u0441\u0441\u0430](https://svpressa.ru/economy/article/502927/)\n\n**Decline in Nanny Vocational Interest in Vienne: 'It's Not an Easy Job, But I Don't Regret My Choice'**\nThe Caisse d'allocations familiales (Caf) of Vienne is expressing serious concern over an unprecedented decline in vocational interest for assistantes maternelles (nannies). In 2023, 106 individuals received their authorization; this number dropped to 89 in 2024 and further to 81 in 2025. Simultaneously, 200 assistantes maternelles chose to leave the profession, resulting in a negative net change. Factors contributing to this decline include retirement, housing constraints, and strained relationships with parents. The Department's Directorate for Childhood and Family confirms the trend, noting a steady decrease in approved caregivers. Despite this, the Caf emphasizes the availability of support measures and highlights that 21 million euros will be allocated in 2026 to support early childhood care and the profession.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 07:40 PM\nSource:[lanouvellerepublique.fr](https://www.lanouvellerepublique.fr/poitiers/baisse-des-vocations-d-assistantes-maternelles-dans-la-vienne-ce-n-est-pas-un-metier-simple-mais-je-ne-regrette-pas-mon-choix-1771270833)\n\n**100,000 Residents Flock to Renew IDs Ahead of Paper Card Expiry: Councilor Calls for Urgent Service Expansion**\nIn Palermo, over 100,000 residents are required to renew their paper ID cards before the expiration date of August 3, 2026, when the paper version will no longer be valid. Despite the city administration's decision to open additional office hours in preparation, long queues and extended waiting times have already been reported at the civil registry offices. Consigliere Natale Puma has formally requested the mayor, Roberto Lagalla, and the personnel assessor, Dario Falzone, to urgently address the situation by either increasing staff or allowing overtime work. Puma emphasized that the high volume of requests\u2014expected to strain the offices already burdened with routine tasks\u2014risks undermining service efficiency.

Key trends include a shift from audience-based to intent- and context-driven targeting, as AI agents pre-filter content for users; a renewed focus on SEO alongside generative AI optimization (GEO), with Google still dominating search traffic despite AI competition; hyper-personalization across digital platforms driven by real-time data signals; the growing importance of proprietary data and original insights to stand out in AI-generated content; AI exposing low-quality, generic marketing by favoring brands with unique perspectives and data; small businesses leveraging micro- and nano-influencers for higher engagement and authentic community building; Google\u2019s Gemini potentially surpassing ChatGPT due to infrastructure and lower friction from ads; a move from keyword-first to interest-first content creation aligned with user behavior; interactive, participatory marketing experiences like calculators and quizzes becoming essential for engagement and data collection; and growing consumer and marketer backlash against AI over-hype, environmental concerns, and lack of transparency\u2014leading to calls for labeling human-created content. Experts advise marketers to create dual-purpose content (human- and AI-friendly), invest in original data, embrace interactivity, prioritize SEO and E-EAT guidelines, and maintain transparency in AI use to stay competitive.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:55 PM\nSource:[WordStream Keyword Research and Organization Software for PPC & SEO](https://www.wordstream.com/blog/2026-marketing-predictions)\n\n**New Construction Market Faces Cooling Demand for Mortgages**\nThe market for new residential properties in Russia has experienced a cooling in mortgage demand, according to data from 'Etazhi' company. In January 2026, the number of mortgage applications for new apartments dropped by 46.6% compared to December 2025 and by 37.4% compared to January 2025. This decline is primarily attributed to the exhaustion of pre-emptive demand, as many families who planned to use family mortgage programs rushed to secure loans before new restrictions took effect, temporarily boosting the market at the end of 2025. The sharp drop in February is a logical continuation of this trend. Additional pressure comes from new program requirements, including mandatory registration of children and parents at the same address, complications with alternative deals, and difficulties selling old housing, which reduce the accessibility of subsidized mortgages even for formally eligible applicants. While primary market transactions declined by 36.2% compared to January, the drop is less severe due to the inertia of previously approved applications, a trend expected to gradually fade. In contrast, demand for market-rate mortgages rose: by 10.3% from January and 42.5% year-on-year as of February 15, 2026. This indicates a structural shift in demand, with some buyers delaying new construction purchases or shifting to the secondary market, where offerings are more flexible and transactions simpler in terms of formal requirements. For developers, the current data suggests continued pressure on sales in the first half of 2026. Support may come from discussions on differentiated interest rates and potential new government measures for families with children, though their impact is likely to be limited. In the second half of 2026, demand is expected to gradually shift toward secondary housing, driven by anticipated monetary policy easing by the Central Bank of Russia, leaving the new construction market in a cooling phase. Under the baseline scenario, this implies moderate sales volumes, increased competition for buyers, and subdued stock performance for developers without strong catalysts for rapid recovery.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 04:23 PM\nSource:[Investing.com \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f](https://ru.investing.com/analysis/article-200329126)\n\n**Russia Warns of Changes Starting April 1, 2026, for Consumers Using Installment Plans**\nStarting April 1, 2026, a new federal law will come into effect in Russia regulating installment purchase services to protect consumers from uncontrolled debt accumulation. According to Alexander Khaminsky, a lawyer and head of the Moscow and Moscow Oblast Legal Order Center, the law aims to prevent over-indebtedness and improve consumer awareness of installment terms, including penalties for late payments. Under the new law, only companies registered in a central registry maintained by the Central Bank of Russia will be authorized to offer installment plans. The law sets a maximum penalty rate of 20% per annum on overdue amounts. Additionally, the law gradually reduces the maximum interest-free installment period: from 6 months starting April 1, 2026, to 4 months starting April 1, 2028. The law will not apply to contracts signed before April 1, 2026. The article also mentions a prior warning about pension increases in August 2026.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 08:49 AM\nSource:[RT \u043d\u0430 \u0440\u0443\u0441\u0441\u043a\u043e\u043c](https://russian.rt.com/russia/news/1596223-yurist-rassrochka-platezhei)\n\n**250,000 TL Personal Loan Repayment Terms Changed After Interest Rate Drop**\nFollowing the inflation report, expectations of an interest rate cut in financial markets have triggered the first signals in the credit sector, with downward adjustments in personal loan interest rates becoming evident. Previously rising, the lowest personal loan interest rate dropped to 2.79% by February 16, 2026, down from 2.99% earlier in the week. This change has prompted citizens with immediate cash needs to reevaluate their loan costs. According to a report in T\u00fcrkiye Gazetesi, Alternatif Bank offers the lowest rate at 2.79%, while other banks\u2019 rates vary based on credit score, income level, and campaign conditions. Using this 2.79% rate, the repayment schedule for a 250,000 TL personal loan shows a total repayment of 312,777 TL after 12 months. Economists predict that if a rate cut is approved in March 2026, gradual declines in loan interest rates could continue, with the pace and extent dependent on banks\u2019 funding costs and market conditions. Citizens are advised to carefully review total repayment amounts, administrative fees, and insurance deductions before taking out a loan.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 08:25 AM\nSource:[S\u00f6zc\u00fc Gazetesi](https://www.sozcu.com.tr/250-bin-tl-ihtiyac-kredisinin-geri-odemesi-degisti-p294368)\n\n**Gold Rebounds Amid Shifting Signals: Data Arrives, Direction Changes**\nGold prices were supported by inflation data coming in below expectations, which revived hopes for potential interest rate cuts later in the year. However, strong employment data sustained market expectations that the Federal Reserve may keep interest rates higher for longer, partially limiting gold's gains. On February 16, 2026, the latest gold market figures showed a volatile trend, with investor focus shifting between signals for rate cuts and new economic data. The January inflation report falling short of forecasts increased demand for precious metals, while the mid-week employment data reinforced the expectation of prolonged tight monetary policy, putting downward pressure on gold prices. Despite this, the lower-than-expected inflation rekindled optimism about possible rate reductions, prompting buyers to re-enter the market. As of February 16, 2026, gold prices reflected this dynamic interplay between dovish inflation data and hawkish employment figures.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 05:36 AM\nSource:[www.gercekgundem.com](https://www.gercekgundem.com/ekonomi/altin-yeniden-yukseliste-veriler-geldi-yon-degisti-566732)\n\n**New Installment Rules to Take Effect in Novosibirsk from April 1**\nStarting April 1, 2026, installment plans in Novosibirsk will officially become a separate financial service under Federal Law No. 283-\u0424\u0417. The law prohibits sellers from setting different prices for cash and installment payments, requiring a single, uniform price regardless of payment method. The practice of offering 'discounts for full payment' will be eliminated. The maximum interest-free installment period is limited to six months for contracts signed in 2026 and four months for those signed in 2028; any extension beyond these limits automatically converts the installment plan into a consumer loan. If a customer's debt exceeds 50,000 rubles, operators must report the data to credit bureaus. Late payment penalties are capped at 20% annually. Contracts signed before April 1, 2026, will remain under previous terms. New rules apply only to agreements made after this date.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 12:20 AM\nSource:[\u0410\u0440\u0433\u0443\u043c\u0435\u043d\u0442\u044b \u0438 \u0444\u0430\u043a\u0442\u044b](https://nsk.aif.ru/society/novye-pravila-rassrochki-nachnut-deystvovat-v-novosibirske-s-1-aprelya)\n\n**Changes to Severance Pay Payments in Colombia from 2026: What Workers and Employers Must Know**\nColombia's Labor Reform Law 2466 of 2025 introduces significant changes to the payment and management of severance pay (cesant\u00edas) starting in 2026. The law preserves the worker's fundamental right to receive a monthly salary equivalent for each year worked, but adds new flexibility. Employers may now pay severance directly to workers without penalties, provided the worker voluntarily agrees and the funds are used for authorized purposes such as unemployment, education, or housing. This does not eliminate the need to maintain a severance fund account. The reform also allows for advance, periodic contributions (e.g., monthly) of 8.33% of the salary toward severance, which do not count as partial payments and do not affect the annual liquidation. Additionally, interest on severance pay, previously paid annually at 12%, can now be paid monthly at 1% of the base salary per month, with a written, voluntary agreement. The deadline for consigning 2025 severance pay is February 14, 2026, or the next business day if that date falls on a weekend or holiday\u2014thus February 16, 2026, for 2026. Interest payments must be made by January 31, 2026, under either the traditional or monthly agreement model.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 12:25 PM\nSource:[Caracol Radio](https://caracol.com.co/2026/02/15/cambia-la-forma-de-pago-de-cesantias-para-2026-que-deben-saber-trabajadores-y-empleadores/)\n\n**Is the patent office becoming more patent-friendly?**\nThe U.S. patent system has shown a measurable shift toward being more favorable to patent owners, particularly in post-grant proceedings such as inter partes review (IPR) and post-grant review (PGR), which are administered by the Patent Trial and Appeal Board (PTAB) at the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO). From 2011 to 2024, IPR institution rates remained stable in the mid-60% range, peaking at approximately 68% in fiscal year 2024. Historically, once instituted, IPR and PGR proceedings resulted in the invalidation of 65\u201375% of challenged claims, leading to the PTAB being labeled a 'patent death squad.' However, a significant policy shift began on March 26, 2025, when the USPTO formalized discretionary denials\u2014decisions not to institute proceedings even when statutory thresholds are met. From January 21 to March 23, 2025, 31% of denials were discretionary, but this rose to 59% from March 26 to April 30, 2025, and to 77% from May 1 to July 1, 2025. By September 2025, institution rates had declined to approximately 35% due to increased discretionary denials. In January 2026, the USPTO designated several PTAB decisions on discretionary denial as precedential and informative, establishing binding guidance on factors such as parallel district court litigation timing (under the Fintiv framework), serial petitions, and procedural compliance, including real-party-in-interest disclosure. These changes have shifted leverage toward patent owners at the institution stage, although the PTAB remains a high-risk forum for challenged claims. The trend indicates a strategic effort to reduce the number of proceedings initiated while maintaining rigorous scrutiny on those that proceed.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 01, 2026 06:00 AM\nSource:[Business Journal](https://www.bizjournals.com/stlouis/news/2026/02/01/patent-office-more-friendly.html)\n\n**What Changes for Homebuyers and Property Owners in 2026: New Mortgage Rules, Compensation for Delays, and Biometric Transactions**\nStarting January 1, 2026, buyers of residential property in Russia will regain the right to claim liquidated damages (penalties) from developers for delayed project completions, as the moratorium on such claims expired after December 31, 2025. The moratorium was initially introduced in 2020 during the pandemic and renewed multiple times, but is no longer in effect. Compensation is calculated as: apartment price \u00d7 number of overdue days \u00d7 1/150 of the Central Bank\u2019s key rate on the deadline date. Buyers may also claim compensation if defects are not rectified within the agreed timeframe. To claim, buyers must first submit a formal demand to the developer; if unresolved, they may pursue legal action. A key warning: signing a supplementary agreement to extend the handover date forfeits the right to claim penalties, so buyers must carefully weigh whether to accept bonuses (e.g., a parking space) or retain compensation rights. Additionally, as of January 1, 2026, spouses and children can be registered in jointly owned property purchased with maternity capital without requiring bank consent, though the property remains pledged to the bank until the loan is fully repaid. Changes to the Far Eastern and Arctic mortgage programs (2% interest rate) include eligibility for families with a third or subsequent child born after January 1, 2024, removal of parental age limits, and inclusion of all state/municipal education workers in the Far Eastern Federal District and Arctic Zone. The programs now allow purchases of secondary housing in areas with no new construction or fewer than two ongoing projects, provided the building is no older than 20 years and not in a hazardous condition. The family mortgage program also changes: only one loan per family is allowed, both spouses must be co-borrowers, and refinancing of 'combo mortgages' (a mix of subsidized and market-rate loans) is simplified\u2014allowing refinancing of the market-rate portion separately when rates drop. The 12 million ruble cap (6 million outside Moscow) for subsidized loans remains. Payment deadlines for utilities will shift from the 10th to the 15th of the following month, with bills issued by the 5th, improving alignment with typical bi-monthly pay cycles. Finally, starting July 1, 2026, real estate transactions can be conducted using biometric data (face, voice, and future iris recognition) stored in the state Unified Biometric System, accessible via MFCs or select bank branches. This enables remote identity verification for online deals, eliminating the need for a physical submission of consent for electronic transactions, while still requiring a qualified electronic signature (QES) for security. The system is designed to significantly reduce fraud risk.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 06, 2026 07:35 AM\nSource:[kp.ru](https://www.kp.ru/daily/27747.5/5193898/)\n\n**Black and White Chef 2 Faces Declining Interest Amid Economic Downturn, Yet Sparks Revival in Dining Industry**\nThe second season of 'Black and White Chef' has seen lower public interest compared to its first season, with Google Trends data showing a 25% decrease in search volume\u2014peaking at 75 in the most recent period versus 100 during the first season's launch in late September and early October 2024. This decline is attributed to broader economic challenges, including a consumer downturn driven by rising interest rates, increasing housing costs, and a shift in consumer priorities toward health and diet over dining out. The Bank of Korea's Consumer Confidence Index (CCSI) fell 2.5 points to 109.9 in December 2024, marking the largest drop in a year and the sharpest decline since August 2024. Among younger consumers (under 40), the decline was even steeper at 3 points. The second season is perceived as more documentary-like, with reduced entertainment value compared to the first season, which leaned more toward entertainment. Despite this, the show has helped revive interest in the restaurant industry, particularly around the holidays. Data from the mobile analytics platform Mobile Index shows that CatchTable, a reservation app, reached a record 1.4 million weekly active users in late 2024\u2014indicating a strong correlation between the show's broadcast and increased user engagement. Industry experts, including Professor Lee Young-ae from Incheon University, note that while the show has a short-term promotional effect by attracting younger audiences through diverse cooking styles, it may also exacerbate inequality by creating a 'winner-takes-all' effect, where only a few chefs or restaurants benefit, leaving others behind. The show's impact is seen as a temporary boost amid a deeper economic downturn.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: January 03, 2026 05:11 AM\nSource:[\uc778\ud130\ub137\ub274\uc2a4 \ud55c\uacbd\ub2f7\ucef4](https://www.hankyung.com/article/2026010284737)\n\n**\u00c7ift\u00e7i Kay\u0131t Sistemi Applications Close in Final Three Days for 2026 Production Year**\nProducers seeking agricultural support must complete their applications for the 2026 production year through the \u00c7ift\u00e7i Kay\u0131t Sistemi (\u00c7KS) by December 31, 2025.

The minimum wage (Smic) will increase by 1.18%, adding approximately 17 euros net per month. Pension revaluations will rise by 0.9%, a lower increase than in previous years due to reduced inflation. Home insurance premiums are expected to rise by 8% to 11% due to increasing climate-related risks, following a 7.2% increase in 2025 and a 30% rise over three years. The DPE (energy performance certificate) will be revised: the coefficient for electricity in the calculation will drop from 2.3 to 1.9, potentially reclassifying 700,000 homes from 'thermal black holes' to better energy ratings. Rose-colored license plates will be introduced for vehicles with provisional registration (WW or W garage) to combat fraud, affecting around 400,000 vehicles. La Poste will raise postal tariffs by an average of 7.4% for letters and packages and 3.4% for Colissimo, both domestically and internationally, to maintain universal service quality amid declining mail volume. Donations of money, goods, or securities must now be declared online via the tax authority\u2019s website, with paper forms still available for those without internet access; failure to declare may result in taxation without deductions, penalties, interest, or family disputes. MaPrimeR\u00e9nov', a government energy renovation grant, will be suspended due to the unapproved 2026 budget, leaving around 80,000 ongoing applications unresolved and making home renovations significantly more expensive. A new paid parental leave (cong\u00e9 de naissance) of one or two months, split or concurrent, will be introduced\u2014indemnified at 70% of net salary in the first month and 60% in the second\u2014but its rollout has been delayed to July 2026, though parents of children born or adopted between January 1 and May 31, 2026, will still qualify.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: December 29, 2025 05:52 AM\nSource:[Ladepeche.fr](https://www.ladepeche.fr/2025/12/29/tout-ce-qui-change-au-1er-janvier-2026-smic-et-retraites-revalorises-hausse-des-assurances-les-nouveautes-qui-vous-concernent-13131653.php)\n\n**Google makes major Green Card change: report**\nGoogle will resume reviewing green card sponsorship applications through the Program Electronic Review Management (PERM) system in 2026, after pausing most filings in January 2023 during a major round of layoffs that affected 12,000 employees. The company's decision to restart PERM applications\u2014marking a three-year pause\u2014signals renewed confidence in hiring and immigration trends. According to an internal December 2025 memo reviewed by Business Insider, Google will 'ramp up' PERM filings in 2026, with eligibility restricted to employees with a 'MI rating or higher' and requiring remote employees to agree to transfer to an office to qualify. PERM is the first step in the green card process, requiring employers to demonstrate that no qualified U.S. workers are available for the role. During the pause, Google only filed for a small number of employees. Immigration attorney Ava Benach noted that Google's actions have had a significant industry-wide effect, stating that 'tech companies have been following Google's lead' and that Google's retreat gave others 'cover to step back' as well. Eligible employees are expected to be contacted by external immigration legal counsel in the first quarter (Q1) of 2026, though the company did not clarify whether self-nomination or pre-eligibility checks are possible.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 23, 2025 04:25 PM\nSource:[Newsweek](https://www.newsweek.com/google-green-card-sponsorship-perm-change-11261326)\n\n**Hype Around New Construction Market Due to Upcoming Family Mortgage Changes May Trigger Sharp Decline in 2026**\nA surge in demand for new housing in Russia during autumn and winter 2025 is driven not by rising incomes but by upcoming changes to the family mortgage program, effective February 1, 2026. Under the new rules, couples will be allowed only one subsidized mortgage at a 6% annual interest rate, eliminating the previous practice of dual loans. Additionally, so-called 'donor schemes'\u2014where a mortgage is taken out in a third party's name for resale\u2014will be banned to prevent abuse of the program. These changes have triggered a rush among families to secure housing before the rules take effect, fearing loss of access to subsidized loans. Developers are capitalizing on this urgency, promoting slogans like 'Hurry before February, when conditions get stricter.' In October\u2013December 2025, subsidized mortgages became the primary driver of demand, accounting for 80\u201390% of apartment purchases in some regions. However, this surge is temporary, reflecting a shift of demand from 2026 to late 2025 rather than genuine market confidence. The market is expected to face a significant downturn in the first half of 2026, especially if the Central Bank\u2019s key interest rate remains high. Industry experts recommend developers prepare for declining sales volumes and adjust strategies accordingly. The government is urged to monitor the situation closely, as the current trend resembles 'demand compression,' and warns that without additional support measures or interest rate reductions, a sharp decline in housing market activity could occur as early as spring 2026.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 12, 2025 11:21 AM\nSource:[abireg.ru](https://abireg.ru/newsitem/111066/)\n\n**Google Trends: Why taxpayers are searching more about the Income Tax Department**\nThe term 'Income Tax Department' has become one of the most searched keywords on Google Trends due to over 1.1 crore taxpayers still awaiting processing of their income tax returns (ITRs) for Assessment Year (AY) 2025-26. As of November 26, 2025, 8.21 crore ITRs have been filed, with 8.1 crore verified, but only 6.98 crore processed, leaving more than 1.1 crore returns in the queue. This surge in searches is driven by refund delays, the approaching belated ITR deadline of December 31, 2025, and recent tax reforms, including the passage of the Income Tax Bill, 2025, which will replace the 1961 Income Tax Act from April 1, 2026. The filing deadline was extended to September 16, 2025, from the usual July 31, due to changes in rules, forms, and compliance requirements. Taxpayers are searching for updates on penalties, interest on refunds, and how to file belated returns. Penalties for belated filing are Rs 1,000 for taxable income below Rs 5 lakh and Rs 5,000 for higher income. Interest of 1% per month is charged on unpaid tax under Section 234A, but taxpayers receive 0.5% monthly interest (6% annually) on refunds, calculated from the filing date or April 1 of the assessment year. Google Trends data confirms sustained high search volumes for terms like 'refund status', 'belated ITR penalties', and 'interest on refund'. The Financial Express reports that anxiety is rising as the December 31, 2025 deadline nears, and search activity is expected to increase further.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 10:46 AM\nSource:[The Financial Express](https://www.financialexpress.com/money/google-trends-why-taxpayers-are-searching-more-about-the-income-tax-department-4058056/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
