Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**1. Inside.fifa (FIFA promotional content)**
- **Date**: Not explicitly dated, but references 2026 World Cup promotional material
- **Quality**: Official FIFA source but purely promotional; no predictive value
- **Key facts**: Tournament details (June 11-July 19, 2026; 48 teams; 104 matches)
- **Relevance**: Provides tournament structure but no probability insights

**2. Polymarket (prediction market, $156.8M volume)**
- **Date**: Data appears current as of article retrieval
- **Quality**: High-volume prediction market with real money at stake
- **Key facts**: 
  - Traditional winners (Spain 16%, England 14%, France 12%, Argentina 10%, Brazil 9%, Germany 6%, Italy 2%) = ~69%
  - First-time winners combined ≈28% (Portugal 8%, Netherlands 3%, Norway 3%, others)
- **Relevance**: High - direct market probability for the underlying question

**3. Manifold Markets (play-money prediction market)**
- **Date**: Current
- **Quality**: Play-money market, lower signal than real-money markets
- **Key facts**: Shows 18% for first-time winner (vs 13% on Metaculus)
- **Relevance**: Moderate - shows another crowd prediction slightly higher than Metaculus

**4. Fox Sports (betting odds article)**
- **Date**: December 5, 2025
- **Quality**: Reputable sports outlet reporting bookmaker odds
- **Key facts**: Historical context (only 8 countries ever won); group stage odds favor traditional powers
- **Relevance**: Moderate - shows market sentiment but doesn't directly address first-time winner probability

**5. CBS Sports (tournament logistics)**
- **Date**: February 15, 2026 (2 days before question opening)
- **Quality**: Reputable outlet
- **Key facts**: Betting odds show Spain +450, England +550, France +750, Brazil +750 as favorites
- **Relevance**: Low - primarily logistical information

**6. The Independent (T20 Cricket World Cup)**
- **Date**: February 6, 2026
- **Quality**: N/A - wrong sport entirely
- **Relevance**: None

**7. Agent Report (Metaculus historical data)**
- **Finding**: No historical community prediction data available for question #41090
- **Relevance**: Critical - confirms we have only one datapoint (13% as of Feb 16, 2026)

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Metaculus community predictions on similar sports questions**
   - Suitability: Limited - no historical data available for this specific question

2. **Prediction market stability over 9-day periods**
   - Suitability: Moderate - relevant for understanding typical volatility
   - Pattern: Short-term (9 days) predictions on established questions typically show low volatility absent major news

3. **FIFA World Cup winner predictions - historical accuracy**
   - Suitability: High for underlying question, but we're predicting Metaculus community behavior
   - Pattern: Traditional powers dominate; only 8 winners in 96 years suggests ~8-15% base rate for first-time winner

4. **Metaculus community prediction movements on sports questions near resolution**
   - Suitability: High - directly relevant to predicting community behavior
   - Pattern: As tournaments approach, predictions typically converge toward market consensus unless new information emerges

**Most suitable reference class**: Metaculus community prediction stability over short timeframes (9 days) on questions where the underlying event is months away (World Cup is June-July 2026, 4+ months out).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 9 days (Feb 17 to Feb 25, 2026)

**Key temporal factors:**
- World Cup is still 4+ months away (starts June 11, 2026)
- Group draw completed in December 2025
- Final 6 playoff spots to be determined in March 2026
- No major tournaments or qualifiers occurring during the 9-day window

**Historical patterns:**
- Prediction markets on distant events (4+ months) typically show low volatility over short periods (days) absent major news
- Sports betting odds remain relatively stable in periods without games
- Metaculus community predictions tend to converge toward market consensus over time
- Current Metaculus prediction (13%) is notably lower than Polymarket (~28%) and Manifold (18%)

## (d) Justification

The question asks whether Metaculus community prediction will **rise above 13%** by February 25, 2026.

**Factors favoring stability (prediction stays at or below 13%):**
1. Short timeframe (9 days) with no scheduled major events
2. World Cup is 4+ months away - unlikely to have significant news
3. Community predictions on distant events show low volatility
4. Current prediction (13%) has been established and represents community consensus

**Factors favoring increase (prediction rises above 13%):**
1. Metaculus (13%) is significantly below other prediction markets: Polymarket (~28%), Manifold (18%)
2. Metaculus forecasters may adjust upward toward market consensus
3. Historical base rate suggests 10-15% is reasonable for first-time winner
4. March playoff determination could generate discussion/attention
5. Any injury news to traditional favorites could shift probabilities

**Critical insight**: The Metaculus prediction is notably lower than other markets. This suggests either:
- Metaculus forecasters have different information/methodology
- There's potential for convergence toward the 18-28% range seen elsewhere
- The 13% represents a stable, well-considered community view

Given the 9-day window and absence of scheduled catalysts, modest movement is more likely than large swings.

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring considerations:**
- Current Metaculus: 13%
- Manifold: 18% 
- Polymarket implied: ~28%
- Historical base rate: ~10-15%

**Probability calibration:**
The question resolves YES if prediction rises **at all** above 13.00% (even to 13.01%).

Key factors:
1. **Short timeframe reduces volatility**: 9 days is very short for significant movement
2. **No scheduled catalysts**: No games, draws, or major events in this window
3. **Market divergence creates pressure**: The gap between Metaculus (13%) and other markets (18-28%) suggests potential for upward adjustment
4. **Metaculus forecaster behavior**: Sophisticated forecasters may notice the divergence and adjust
5. **Small threshold**: Only needs to exceed 13.00%, not reach a significantly higher level

**Base rate considerations:**
- On prediction markets, 9-day movements of >0% are common but not guaranteed
- Questions 4+ months from resolution typically show lower volatility
- Community predictions can shift based on discussion/new forecasters even without news

**Probability estimation:**
- Probability of NO movement: ~30-40% (prediction stays exactly at 13%)
- Probability of small increase (13.01-15%): ~35-45%
- Probability of larger increase (>15%): ~15-25%
- Probability of decrease: ~5-10%

Combined probability of ANY increase above 13%: ~55-70%

Considering the market divergence and sophisticated Metaculus forecasters who may notice this gap, I estimate toward the higher end of this range.
