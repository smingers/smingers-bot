Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis:**

1. **Inside.fifa (FIFA official source)**: Promotional content about the 2026 World Cup's economic impact and scale. High credibility for factual information (dates, format, host cities) but purely promotional with no competitive predictions. No opinions from betting or forecasting experts.

2. **Polymarket (Feb 2026)**: Prediction market data showing $156M in volume. High-quality source for market sentiment. Key finding: Combined probability for "never won before" countries is ~28% (Portugal 8%, Netherlands 3%, Norway 3%, plus numerous smaller probabilities). This is a factual aggregation of market participants' beliefs, not expert opinion.

3. **Manifold Markets**: Shows 18% probability for a first-time winner, with 5.6k Ṁ volume. Lower volume than Polymarket but still meaningful. Notably higher than the current Metaculus 13% prediction.

4. **Fox Sports (Dec 5, 2025)**: Betting odds from DraftKings. Spain, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, and England are top favorites (all at -10000 to advance from groups). Portugal at -5000, France at -2500. This indirectly suggests traditional powers dominate, implying lower probability for first-time winners.

5. **CBS Sports (Feb 15, 2026)**: Most recent source. Betting odds show Spain +450, England +550, France +750, Brazil +750 as favorites. All are previous winners, suggesting bookmakers see low probability of first-time winner.

6. **Independent (Feb 6, 2026)**: Not relevant - covers cricket T20 World Cup.

7. **Agent Report**: Confirms no historical Metaculus data available for this question. Only current 13% prediction is verifiable. No trend data exists.

**Key factual findings:**
- Current Metaculus prediction: 13% (as of Feb 16, 2026)
- Polymarket aggregate for first-time winners: ~28%
- Manifold prediction: 18%
- Traditional powers (previous winners) dominate betting markets
- Resolution date: Feb 25, 2026 (9 days from now)

(b) **Reference Class Analysis:**

Possible reference classes:
1. **Historical Metaculus prediction stability over 9-day periods**: Most relevant but no data available due to lack of historical tracking.

2. **Prediction market convergence between platforms**: Polymarket (28%), Manifold (18%), and Metaculus (13%) show divergence. Typically, prediction markets converge as resolution approaches, but this question resolves before the actual World Cup, so convergence dynamics differ.

3. **Metaculus community predictions on sports questions**: Limited data, but sports questions often see less volatility than geopolitical questions because fewer breaking news events dramatically change probabilities.

4. **Meta-questions about Metaculus predictions**: This is a meta-question asking whether the Metaculus prediction will rise above 13%. The base rate for such questions depends on:
   - Current prediction proximity to threshold (currently exactly at 13%)
   - Time remaining (9 days)
   - Information flow rate in the domain

**Most suitable reference class**: Meta-questions about prediction platform behavior over short timeframes, combined with cross-platform prediction comparison.

(c) **Timeframe Analysis:**

- **Prediction timeframe**: 9 days (Feb 17 to Feb 25, 2026)
- **Context**: The World Cup itself runs June 11 - July 19, 2026 (still ~4 months away)
- **Key consideration**: This question resolves before the tournament, so it's purely about forecaster sentiment shifts, not actual match outcomes

Over 9-day periods:
- Major news (injuries, team announcements, qualifying results) could shift predictions
- However, the World Cup draw already occurred (December 2025), and groups are set
- Playoff matches to determine final 6 teams occur in March 2026
- Between now and Feb 25, limited new information expected

The question asks if the prediction will be *higher* than 13.00%, meaning even 13.01% counts as "Yes."

(d) **Justification:**

The current Metaculus prediction sits exactly at the threshold (13%). For the prediction to rise above 13%, we need:

**Factors favoring increase (Yes outcome):**
1. **Cross-platform divergence**: Polymarket shows 28% and Manifold shows 18%, both substantially higher than Metaculus 13%. If Metaculus forecasters become aware of this divergence, they might adjust upward.
2. **Anchoring at threshold**: Being exactly at 13% suggests the prediction is in flux. Small movements are likely.
3. **Recency weighting**: Metaculus uses recency-weighted median. New forecasts in the next 9 days will disproportionately affect the community prediction.
4. **Information asymmetry**: If any news emerges about injuries to key players from traditional powers (Spain, Argentina, Brazil, France, England), this could boost first-time winner probabilities.

**Factors favoring decrease or stability (No outcome):**
1. **Betting market consensus**: Professional bookmakers heavily favor traditional powers, suggesting expert opinion leans toward repeat winners.
2. **Historical precedent**: Only 8 countries have ever won in 96 years. This strong base rate anchors predictions downward.
3. **Limited new information**: With 9 days until resolution and 4 months until the tournament, few catalysts exist for major shifts.
4. **Status quo bias**: Predictions often exhibit inertia, especially over short timeframes.

**Critical insight**: The question asks if the prediction will be *higher* than 13.00%, not higher than or equal to. This means the current state (13.00%) resolves to "No." For "Yes," the prediction must move to at least 13.01%.

Outside view calibration:

(a) **True probability consideration**: I need to estimate the probability that Metaculus forecasters will collectively shift their median prediction upward by at least 0.01 percentage points over 9 days.

(b) **Rough figures to tether to**:
- Polymarket: 28% (15 percentage points higher)
- Manifold: 18% (5 percentage points higher)
- Current Metaculus: 13%
- The gap between platforms suggests room for upward movement

(c) **Probability precision**: The difference between 45% and 55% is meaningful here. This is essentially a coin flip with slight bias.

(d) **Rate of upsets**: In meta-questions about prediction movements, the base rate of crossing thresholds depends on:
- How close to the threshold (currently exactly at it)
- Volatility of the underlying question (sports questions moderate volatility)
- Time remaining (9 days allows for some movement but not dramatic shifts)

**Key calibration factors:**
1. Being exactly at the threshold (13.00%) increases the probability of crossing it, as any small upward movement triggers "Yes"
2. The existence of higher predictions on other platforms (18% and 28%) suggests Metaculus may be undervalued
3. However, 9 days is relatively short for major consensus shifts
4. The recency-weighted median means a few active forecasters could move the needle

**Historical context**: Without specific data on Metaculus prediction volatility over 9-day periods, I estimate moderate probability of upward movement. The exact threshold positioning (13.00%) is crucial - this isn't asking for a move to 15% or 20%, just above 13.00%.

Given:
- Exact threshold positioning: +10-15 percentage points to probability
- Cross-platform divergence suggesting undervaluation: +10 percentage points
- Short timeframe limiting major shifts: -10 percentage points
- Limited catalysts before Feb 25: -5 percentage points
- Recency weighting allowing small groups to influence: +5 percentage points

Outside View Prediction:
52%
