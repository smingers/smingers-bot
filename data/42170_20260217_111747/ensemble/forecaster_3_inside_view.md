Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
This resolves **Yes** if the Metaculus community prediction for “first-time 2026 World Cup winner” is **> 13.00%** at **2026-02-25 03:09:27Z**; otherwise **No**.

2) (a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; date)
- DeFiRate (Feb 2026): Aggregates Kalshi/Polymarket prices for outright winner. Good for **what markets think**; not expert analysis. Shows Spain/England/France lead; also lists non-winner contenders (Portugal, Netherlands, etc.) with meaningful shares. Reliable-ish as a market snapshot, but secondary reporting.
- Goal.com (Dec 2025): Betting-oriented editorial overview of contenders/dark horses. Mostly narrative; some factual context; medium reliability, but not a primary odds feed.
- FanDuel Research (Feb 9 2026): Promotional stub without the actual odds in the extract; low evidentiary value.
- ESPN (mid-Dec 2025, “74 days ago”): Group draw takeaways. High-quality outlet; mostly qualitative tournament preview. Relevance is indirect (groups, perceived strength).
- Fox Sports (Dec 5 2025): DraftKings odds list. Strong as a **book odds snapshot** (assuming accurate transcription); relevant because it implies who is realistically in the win mix.
- Sports Illustrated (Nov 2025): Top-10 contenders ranking (editorial). Mixed analysis/opinion; medium evidentiary value.
- AskNews: Sports.ru (Feb 16 2026) Polymarket wager totals + top probabilities. Useful as a **market sentiment** snapshot; secondary but plausibly accurate.
- AskNews: Opta/supercomputer prediction articles (Dec 2025–Jan 2026, multiple outlets): Methodology-based simulation probabilities; relevant as an “analytical model” view, but still model-dependent and often syndicated/duplicative.
- AskNews: Celebrity/player predictions (Djokovic; Vinícius Jr.) (Feb 16–17 2026): Anecdotal; minimal forecasting value.
- AskNews: FIFA concern about low ticket interest (Feb 17 2026): Not directly relevant to “first-time winner” probability.

3) (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence
- Cross-platform market baselines implying **non-trivial** probability mass on never-winner teams (Polymarket/Kalshi VWAP snapshots; DraftKings odds listing Portugal/Netherlands/etc. as plausible contenders). This matters because Metaculus forecasters often partially arbitrate toward liquid markets when a question looks “off.”

Moderate evidence
- Multiple independent-ish “probability” framings (book odds lists + Polymarket + Opta-style models) consistently show at least one **never-won** team (especially Portugal; sometimes Netherlands) with meaningful chance. That tends to pressure a **13%** estimate upward.
- Metaculus aggregation is a **recency-weighted median**: with 8 days left, a modest number of new forecasts can move the displayed community prediction above 13.00%.

Weak evidence
- Editorial rankings (SI/Goal) and group-draw previews (ESPN): informative context but only weakly connected to short-horizon Metaculus CP movement.
- Celebrity/player picks: essentially noise for this meta-resolution.

Key push–pull for the *community prediction*:
- Upward push: other markets/models often imply a higher “first-time winner” chance than 13% (because Portugal alone is often mid-single digits, plus Netherlands/Belgium/Colombia/Morocco/etc.).
- Downward push / inertia: forecasters anchored to the long-run historical fact “only 8 winners ever,” and short horizon until Feb 25 may mean **limited new catalysts**; plus the CP could simply sit at 13.00% if little trading/forecasting occurs.

4) (c) Timeframe analysis
- Time remaining: ~8 days (from 2026-02-17 to 2026-02-25).
- If halved (~4 days): I’d expect **more inertia**, higher chance CP remains exactly 13.00% → lower Yes probability.
- If doubled (~16 days): more opportunity for forecasters to notice cross-market gaps / post writeups / update → higher Yes probability.

5) (d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from the outside view)
Outside view base rate given: 52% (chance CP ends >13% given threshold proximity and platform dynamics).

Inside view adjustments:
- Slightly upward: Multiple market/model snapshots (Polymarket/DraftKings/Opta-style) make 13% look a bit low on its face, which increases the chance that at least some Metaculus users nudge it upward (especially because only **+0.01pp** is needed).
- Slightly downward: There’s a non-trivial chance of **no meaningful activity** in 8 days, and “no change” is effectively a **No** because equality fails. Also, World Cup newsflow in late Feb (pre-March playoffs) may be limited.

Net: small upward tilt from 52% to the mid-50s, mainly because (i) threshold is knife-edge, and (ii) cross-platform reference points are noticeably higher than 13%—a common trigger for Metaculus drift upward.

Probability calibration
- Status quo if nothing changes: CP stays 13.00% → **No**.
- My central expectation: some movement is likely; conditional on movement, I think “up” is modestly more likely than “down” because 13% appears low relative to widely visible odds/market chatter.
- Final inside-view probability: **54%** that CP is **>13.00%** at the timestamp.

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: Yes iff Metaculus CP for Q41090 is >13.00% at 2026-02-25 03:09:27Z; else No.
2) Outside view base rate: 52%.
3) Consistency check: 54 out of 100 times, the CP at the deadline is above 13.00%.
4) Top evidence (<=20 words each):
   - Polymarket/book odds give meaningful win chances to never-winner teams; 13% looks low.
   - Only +0.01pp needed; recency-weighted median can move with a few new forecasts.
   - Short 8-day window; risk CP stays unchanged at 13.00% (which would be No).
5) Blind spot: If Metaculus activity is near-zero, CP could stay exactly 13.00% and I’ll overestimate movement.
6) Status quo nudge: Slight pull toward No due to inertia, but outweighed by knife-edge threshold + external odds gap.

Probability: 54%
