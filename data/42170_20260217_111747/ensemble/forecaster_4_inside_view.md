Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. DeFi Rate (8-15 Feb 2026, Polymarket & Kalshi data). Factual VWAP prices; credible for market odds; very recent ⇒ high quality.  
2. Goal.com (Dec 2025). Traditional betting preview; reasonably reliable but 14 mo old ⇒ moderate quality, partly stale.  
3. FanDuel blog (9 Feb 2026). Promotional, no odds given ⇒ low informational value.  
4. ESPN (-74 d). Draw analysis; factual group lists, soft opinions ⇒ weak relevance to overall-winner probability.  
5. Fox Sports (Dec 2025, DraftKings odds). Book odds; reliable but slightly stale; good external benchmark.  
6. Sports Illustrated (Nov 2025, power ranking). Journalistic opinion, some data; moderate reliability, stale.  
7. AskNews packet (16-17 Feb 2026). Multiple pieces echoing “Spain/England/France/Argentina favourites”. Mostly quotes & pundit chatter; weak-to-moderate evidence; all very fresh.  
8. Internal datum: Metaculus community prediction (CP) = 13.00 % on 16 Feb 2026. Precise, authoritative, highly relevant.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Independent price sources (Polymarket, DraftKings) imply ≈25-30 % chance of a first-time winner – more than double Metaculus CP.  
Moderate evidence  
• Manifold market (18 %) and pundit AI models (Opta 17 %, FootballMeetsData 22 %) are above 13 %, supporting “Metaculus low-side”.  
Weak evidence  
• Recent news interviews (Vinícius Jr., Djokovic) name favourites that are mostly previous winners; could reinforce bearish sentiment but are anecdotal.  
• Fan interest / ticket-sales stories irrelevant to title probability.  

Net evidence weight: tilt upward.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time until measurement: 8 days. Recency-weighted median on Metaculus typically moves only a few points in a quiet week. If the horizon were halved to 4 days I would lower my “> 13 %” probability by ~4 pp (less time for convergence). If doubled to 16 days I would raise it ~5 pp (more time for adjustment toward higher external consensus).

(d) Justification – from outside to inside view  
Outside-view baseline (random short-term drift) = 50 %.  
Adjustments:  
+7 pp External markets 5-15 pp higher than Metaculus (structural, multiple sources).  
+4 pp Manifold/AI models also higher (independent confirmation).  
-3 pp Stickiness of median & low site traffic (structural inertia).  
+2 pp “Tie” (exact 13.00 %) unlikely; any tiny positive bump resolves Yes.  
Resulting inside view ≈ 60 %. Rounded after further reflection to 63 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that in roughly 63 out of 100 comparable 8-day windows, the Metaculus community prediction will end strictly above 13.00 %. My subjective 90 % CI is 45-78 %.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Between now (17 Feb) and 25 Feb 2026, will the Metaculus CP for ‘first-time WC winner’ finish > 13 %?”  
2. Outside base rate noted (50 %).  
3. Consistency – “63/100 times the CP ends above 13 %.” Sounds plausible.  
4. Key evidence (≤ 20 w each):  
   • Polymarket sum of never-winners ≈ 28 %.  
   • DraftKings odds imply ≈ 26 % never-winner chance.  
   • Manifold market at 18 %.  
   • Metaculus CP currently only 13 %, exactly on threshold.  
   • Median is sticky but a single sharp forecast can move it ~0.5-1 pp.  
5. Blind-spot – Surge of new Metaculus forecasts citing bookmaker favourites could push CP to 11-12 %.  
6. Status-quo – If almost no one updates, CP may stay 13.00 %, yielding No; inertia risk already discounted (-3 pp).

Probability: 63%
