This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41090) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-25 03:09:27 is higher than 13.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 13.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-25 03:09:27, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

# Summary of Article

**Article Title:** T20 World Cup odds: Latest cricket T20 World Cup betting odds for 2026

**Source:** The Independent

**Date:** February 06, 2026

**Key Information:**

This article is about the **T20 Cricket World Cup 2026**, not the FIFA Football World Cup. The content is therefore **not relevant** to the forecasting question about the 2026 FIFA World Cup winner.

## Article Content Overview:

- **Sport:** Cricket (T20 format), not football/soccer
- **Tournament:** ICC T20 Cricket World Cup 2026
- **Hosts:** India and Sri Lanka (joint hosts)
- **Tournament Dates:** February 7 - March 8, 2026
- **Format:** 20 nations in four groups of five teams
- **Favorites:** India (current holders and co-hosts) are favorites to win
- **Other contenders mentioned:** Sri Lanka, South Africa, Pakistan, New Zealand, Australia, England, West Indies

## Relevance to Forecasting Question:

**None.** This article discusses cricket betting odds and has no connection to the FIFA World Cup or football/soccer. It provides no information that would help forecast whether the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be won by a first-time winner or what the Metaculus community prediction might be on February 25, 2026.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve historical community prediction values for Metaculus question 41090 and any commentary on recent shifts; include archive snapshots if available.
The latest round of open-web searching still yields no documentary evidence for any of the three elements requested for Metaculus question #41090 (“Will the winner of the 2026 FIFA World Cup be a country that has never won before?”):

1. Time-stamped community-prediction values  
   • None of the indexed pages mention a past probability for the question. The only concrete figure that appears anywhere online remains the currently displayed 13 % community prediction reported in the prompt.  
   • No CSV, JSON, chart image, or API response exposing an earlier prediction curve is surfaced. The single technical lead that might have contained such material—the Rethink Priorities post analysing historical Metaculus data—focuses exclusively on artificial-intelligence questions and does not include the World-Cup item or any football-related dataset (Rethink Priorities, 20 Jul 2021).

2. Commentary on recent probability moves  
   • Search results include no blog posts, Substack essays, forum threads, or social-media discussions that reference a numerical change (upward or downward) for question #41090.  
   • The only article recovered (again, the Rethink Priorities AI piece) is unrelated to the FIFA World Cup domain and therefore sheds no light on why the community prediction now sits at 13 % or how it evolved.

3. Archive snapshots  
   • Attempts to locate cached versions of https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41090 at the Internet Archive’s Wayback Machine, archive.today, or other third-party caching services continue to return negative results—“no URLs” or “no captures”—indicating that no outward-facing snapshot has yet been stored. None of the search-engine indices list a dated copy either.  
   • Consequently, there is still no frozen page image that could corroborate earlier probability levels or capture comment-thread timestamps.  

Supporting facts from the current search batch  
• The lone substantive hit, “An examination of Metaculus’ resolved AI predictions and their implications for AI timelines,” shows that historical community-prediction data can in principle be extracted in JSON form, but that post’s public dataset spans only AI questions and does not extend to sports forecasts (Rethink Priorities, 20 Jul 2021).  
• No GitHub repository, Google result, or academic paper exposes an export of Metaculus question #41090. The GitHub CSV list located in the results merely enumerates question URLs; it contains no probability traces (GitHub, accessed 2026-02-17).

Current state of knowledge relevant to the meta-forecast (whether the community prediction will exceed 13 % on 2026-02-25)  
• The sole verified datapoint is the present community prediction of 13 % as of 2026-02-16.  
• Because no earlier datapoints are publicly recoverable, it is impossible to calculate trend velocity, direction, or variance, and equally impossible to attribute any hypothetical drift to specific sporting-news catalysts (e.g., injuries, managerial changes, or FIFA-ranking updates).  
• The absence of archived snapshots means that even if the prediction were to move sharply before 25 February 2026, there is no independent time-stamped record against which to verify or contextualise that movement. Any future analysis will therefore have to rely on real-time scrapes after the fact.

Information gaps that remain  
• Historical probability series: without an official Metaculus API call or an external dataset, the daily (or intraday) prediction path cannot be reconstructed.  
• Qualitative commentary: the motivations of individual forecasters, and any community debate that might explain shifts, remain invisible because the Metaculus comment thread itself is not accessible via public search and has not been archived.  
• Third-party snapshots: no external service currently preserves the page, preventing external auditing of future or past values.

Conclusion  
Based on the evidence presently available, none of the required historical figures, explanatory commentary, or archived snapshots for Metaculus question #41090 exist in the public domain. Only the current 13 % median estimate is verifiable. All elements requested by the original query therefore remain unfulfilled, and no quantitative or qualitative basis exists from which to analyse “recent shifts” in the community prediction.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
