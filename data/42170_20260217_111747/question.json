    "description": "Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts.

The [2026 edition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_FIFA_World_Cup), set to be jointly hosted Canada, Mexico and the United States, will take place from June 11 to July 19 2026.\n> \n> Despite beginning in 1930 and hosting competitions every 4 years, outside of World War 2, only a total of [8 countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_FIFA_World_Cup_finals) have ever won the title.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41090,\"question_id\":40795,\"last_cp\":0.13}}`",
