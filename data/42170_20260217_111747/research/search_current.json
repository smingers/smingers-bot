According to the advanced AI system from Opta, Spain is predicted to win the tournament with a 17% chance, followed by France at 14.1% and England at 11.8%. Argentina, led by Lionel Messi, has a lower projected chance of 8.7%. Opta's predictions are based on team performance data, probability analysis, and simulations of potential match outcomes. Spain, seeking its second World Cup title after 2010, enters the tournament with high morale following victories in UEFA Euro 2024 and reaching the final of the UEFA Nations League 2024\u201325. Head coach Luis de la Fuente, who took charge in December 2022 after leading Spain\u2019s U19 and U21 teams to success, succeeded Luis Enrique after Spain\u2019s early exit from the 2022 World Cup. This marks Spain\u2019s 17th World Cup appearance.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 03, 2026 04:55 AM\nSource:[\u0628\u0648\u0627\u0628\u0629 \u0641\u064a\u062a\u0648](https://www.vetogate.com/5565641)\n\n**Supercomputer Predicts Who Will Win the 2026 World Cup**\nThe analytical portal Football Meets Data used artificial intelligence to simulate 100,000 possible scenarios for the 2026 FIFA World Cup, assessing the chances of nearly every qualified or qualifying team. As of December 4, 2025, Spain is the top favorite with a 22% probability of winning, followed by reigning world champions Argentina (14%), France (9%), England (8%), and Brazil and Colombia (5% each). Portugal has a 4% chance, while the Netherlands, Ecuador, Mexico, Croatia, and Norway each have 3%. Germany, Uruguay, Switzerland, Japan, and Canada are each rated at 2%, and Morocco, Belgium, the USA, Senegal, Austria, and Paraguay are each assigned 1%. Most other teams, including many Asian and African nations and those in intercontinental playoffs, are below 1%. The model considers recent results, individual player performance, team ratings, squad depth, and 'probabilistic indices' measuring long-term team stability. These projections are preliminary and may change after the draw and early tournament matches. Ukraine has not yet secured qualification; they will face Sweden in the playoff semifinal (March 26, 2026), with the winner facing the winner of the Poland-Albania matchup. If Ukraine qualifies, the AI still rates their chances of winning the tournament as symbolic, placing them among teams not considered serious contenders.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: December 07, 2025 07:43 AM\nSource:[OBOZREVATEL](https://www.obozrevatel.com/sport-oboz/superkompyuter-predskazal-kto-vyiigraet-chm-2026-po-futbolu.htm)\n\n**AI Predicts World Cup 2026 Winner and Arab Nations' Chances**\nAccording to global statistics network Opta, which uses computer models based on thousands of equations and technical criteria, Spain is the top contender to win the 2026 FIFA World Cup, with a 17% probability.

Spain is favored with a 17% chance, praised for their balanced roster, European Championship pedigree, and depth in midfield and attack. France follows closely with a 14.1% chance, driven by Kylian Mbapp\u00e9's potential for a second title and their status as 2018 champions and 2022 runners-up. England is third with an 11.8% chance, reflecting confidence in Thomas Tuchel\u2019s ability to end their 60-year title drought. Argentina, the defending champions and favorites among fans, are fourth at 8.7%, with Lionel Messi still a key figure despite the team\u2019s reliance on a similar squad to the 2022-winning side. Germany is fifth at 7.1%, Portugal sixth at 6.6%, and Brazil seventh at 5.6%, despite their past North American triumphs, due to inconsistent recent performances. The Netherlands, who have never won the World Cup, are given a 5.2% chance, while Norway (2.3%) and Colombia (2.0%) are ranked tenth and eleventh, respectively, with Norway's chances boosted by Erling Haaland\u2019s form. The supercomputer also estimates a 3.7% chance that a playoff winner\u2014particularly Italy\u2014could claim the title. Among the host nations, Mexico has the best odds at 1.3%, despite never advancing beyond the quarterfinals, while the USMNT is given a 0.9% chance, below Morocco, Ecuador, and Japan. Canada has the lowest chance at 0.4%, less than Austria, Senegal, and the Ivory Coast, reflecting their limited World Cup history and poor past performances, having lost all three group games in both their 1986 and 2022 appearances.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 05, 2025 01:00 AM\nSource:[Sports Illustrated](https://www.si.com/soccer/supercomputer-predicts-2026-world-cup-winner-before-draw)\n\n**2026 World Cup: Spain Favored to Win According to Opta Predictions**\nAccording to Opta's predictions, Spain has the highest chance of winning the 2026 FIFA World Cup, which will be hosted by Canada, the United States, and Mexico.
