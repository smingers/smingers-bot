The content is therefore **not relevant** to the forecasting question about the 2026 FIFA World Cup winner.\n\n## Article Content Overview:\n\n- **Sport:** Cricket (T20 format), not football/soccer\n- **Tournament:** ICC T20 Cricket World Cup 2026\n- **Hosts:** India and Sri Lanka (joint hosts)\n- **Tournament Dates:** February 7 - March 8, 2026\n- **Format:** 20 nations in four groups of five teams\n- **Favorites:** India (current holders and co-hosts) are favorites to win\n- **Other contenders mentioned:** Sri Lanka, South Africa, Pakistan, New Zealand, Australia, England, West Indies\n\n## Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\n**None.** This article discusses cricket betting odds and has no connection to the FIFA World Cup or football/soccer. It provides no information that would help forecast whether the 2026 FIFA World Cup will be won by a first-time winner or what the Metaculus community prediction might be on February 25, 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve historical community prediction values for Metaculus question 41090 and any commentary on recent shifts; include archive snapshots if available.\nThe latest round of open-web searching still yields no documentary evidence for any of the three elements requested for Metaculus question #41090 (\u201cWill the winner of the 2026 FIFA World Cup be a country that has never won before?\u201d):\n\n1. Time-stamped community-prediction values  \n   \u2022 None of the indexed pages mention a past probability for the question. The only concrete figure that appears anywhere online remains the currently displayed 13 % community prediction reported in the prompt.  \n   \u2022 No CSV, JSON, chart image, or API response exposing an earlier prediction curve is surfaced. The single technical lead that might have contained such material\u2014the Rethink Priorities post analysing historical Metaculus data\u2014focuses exclusively on artificial-intelligence questions and does not include the World-Cup item or any football-related dataset (Rethink Priorities, 20 Jul 2021).\n\n2. Commentary on recent probability moves  \n   \u2022 Search results include no blog posts, Substack essays, forum threads, or social-media discussions that reference a numerical change (upward or downward) for question #41090.  \n   \u2022 The only article recovered (again, the Rethink Priorities AI piece) is unrelated to the FIFA World Cup domain and therefore sheds no light on why the community prediction now sits at 13 % or how it evolved.\n\n3. Archive snapshots  \n   \u2022 Attempts to locate cached versions of https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41090 at the Internet Archive\u2019s Wayback Machine, archive.today, or other third-party caching services continue to return negative results\u2014\u201cno URLs\u201d or \u201cno captures\u201d\u2014indicating that no outward-facing snapshot has yet been stored. None of the search-engine indices list a dated copy either.  \n   \u2022 Consequently, there is still no frozen page image that could corroborate earlier probability levels or capture comment-thread timestamps.  \n\nSupporting facts from the current search batch  \n\u2022 The lone substantive hit, \u201cAn examination of Metaculus\u2019 resolved AI predictions and their implications for AI timelines,\u201d shows that historical community-prediction data can in principle be extracted in JSON form, but that post\u2019s public dataset spans only AI questions and does not extend to sports forecasts (Rethink Priorities, 20 Jul 2021).  \n\u2022 No GitHub repository, Google result, or academic paper exposes an export of Metaculus question #41090. The GitHub CSV list located in the results merely enumerates question URLs; it contains no probability traces (GitHub, accessed 2026-02-17).\n\nCurrent state of knowledge relevant to the meta-forecast (whether the community prediction will exceed 13 % on 2026-02-25)  \n\u2022 The sole verified datapoint is the present community prediction of 13 % as of 2026-02-16.  \n\u2022 Because no earlier datapoints are publicly recoverable, it is impossible to calculate trend velocity, direction, or variance, and equally impossible to attribute any hypothetical drift to specific sporting-news catalysts (e.g., injuries, managerial changes, or FIFA-ranking updates).  \n\u2022 The absence of archived snapshots means that even if the prediction were to move sharply before 25 February 2026, there is no independent time-stamped record against which to verify or contextualise that movement. Any future analysis will therefore have to rely on real-time scrapes after the fact.\n\nInformation gaps that remain  \n\u2022 Historical probability series: without an official Metaculus API call or an external dataset, the daily (or intraday) prediction path cannot be reconstructed.  \n\u2022 Qualitative commentary: the motivations of individual forecasters, and any community debate that might explain shifts, remain invisible because the Metaculus comment thread itself is not accessible via public search and has not been archived.  \n\u2022 Third-party snapshots: no external service currently preserves the page, preventing external auditing of future or past values.\n\nConclusion  \nBased on the evidence presently available, none of the required historical figures, explanatory commentary, or archived snapshots for Metaculus question #41090 exist in the public domain. Only the current 13 % median estimate is verifiable. All elements requested by the original query therefore remain unfulfilled, and no quantitative or qualitative basis exists from which to analyse \u201crecent shifts\u201d in the community prediction.</Agent_report>\n"
