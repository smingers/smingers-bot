- Date: Current methodology + Feb 12, 2026 data point (5.633%)
- Facts: Daily index from actual VA loan rate locks, 35% market coverage, not seasonally adjusted
- No opinions, pure data methodology

**Optimal Blue January 2026 Report (February 10, 2026):**
- Quality: High - official monthly report from data provider

- Facts: Rates peaked above 7% in early 2025, declined through fall 2025
- Limited direct relevance to 9-day forecast

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Recent data point (5.633% on Feb 12)** - Direct, authoritative, identifiable source (FRED/Optimal Blue). This is the actual index value 5 days before forecast opening.
2. **Low volatility regime** - Agent report shows 30-day std dev of 0.038 pp, confirmed by stable Feb 16-17 rates across multiple sources. Multiple independent sources confirm stability.
3. **5.63% floor tested twice** - Clear support level from FRED data (Jan 30, Feb 12). Structural pattern suggesting mean reversion.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Expert consensus for stability** - Bankrate poll shows 55% expect no change, with slight downward bias (27% down vs 18% up). Single reliable survey but clear methodology.
2. **30-day mean at 5.70%** - Agent report calculation from official data. Suggests slight upward drift from current 5.63% is plausible.
3. **Refinance surge narrative** - Optimal Blue report and multiple news sources confirm strong refinance activity at sub-6% rates, suggesting rates may stabilize here to sustain demand.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Fed policy speculation** - Various sources mention potential future cuts, but no Fed meeting before Feb 26. Indirect causal link.
2. **Conforming rate movements** - Forbes/AskNews report 6.02-6.16% for conforming loans. While correlated, VA rates typically run 40-50 bps lower, so not directly predictive.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 9 calendar days (Feb 17-26, 2026), approximately 6-7 trading days.

**If halved (4-5 days):** Would expect even tighter distribution around 5.63-5.70%, likely 5.64-5.68% range. Less time for mean reversion or external shocks.

**If doubled (18 days, ~13 trading days):** Would widen distribution to 5.55-5.85%, allowing for potential Fed communication, economic data releases, or market repositioning. Greater chance of breaking current 5.63-5.76% range.

**Current 9-day horizon:** Optimal for high-confidence narrow distribution. Too short for major structural shifts, long enough for modest mean reversion toward 5.70%.

## (d) Justification

**Key factors shifting from outside view:**

1. **Extremely recent data point (5.633% on Feb 12)** - Only 5 days old, vs. outside view using 30-day average. This anchors prediction more firmly at lower end of recent range. **Moderate downward shift justified.**

2. **Expert consensus for stability** - Bankrate poll of identifiable experts shows 55% expect no change in the overlapping forecast period. This reinforces low volatility assumption. **Confirms narrow distribution.**

3. **Support level at 5.63%** - Tested twice in 2 weeks suggests strong floor. Combined with 30-day mean at 5.70%, creates natural range. **Justifies slight upward bias from 5.63%.**

4. **No catalysts before Feb 26** - No Fed meetings, no major economic releases scheduled. Status quo bias strengthened. **Confirms tight distribution.**

**Distribution shift rationale:**
- Outside view median: 5.68%
- Inside view adjustment: Shift down slightly to 5.66% given very recent 5.633% reading
- Outside view 10th/90th: 5.55-5.82%
- Inside view adjustment: Tighten slightly to 5.57-5.80% given expert consensus for stability and lack of catalysts
- The reference class (14-day movements in current regime) remains highly analogous - no major structural changes justify large shifts

Distribution calibration:

Starting from outside view:
- 10th: 5.55 → 5.57 (floor at 5.63% makes sub-5.60% unlikely in 9 days)
- Median: 5.68 → 5.66 (anchor to Feb 12 value of 5.633%, slight upward drift)
- 90th: 5.82 → 5.80 (expert consensus reduces upside tail risk)

**Calibration reasoning:**
- **10th percentile (5.57%):** Captures scenario where decline continues below recent 5.63% floor. Would require unexpected dovish catalyst or market disruption. Probability ~10% given strong support level and expert consensus.
- **20th percentile (5.62%):** Just below current 5.633% level. Represents continuation of downtrend without mean reversion.
- **40th percentile (5.65%):** Slight uptick from Feb 12, but below 30-day mean. Most likely if rates stay near current levels.
- **60th percentile (5.69%):** Near 30-day mean of 5.70%. Represents modest mean reversion scenario.
- **80th percentile (5.74%):** Upper end of recent 30-day range. Requires some upward pressure but stays within established bounds.
- **90th percentile (5.80%):** Captures upside risk of rate backup. Would require hawkish surprise or technical market factors. Still well below 6% threshold.

**Distribution shape:** Slightly right-skewed given floor at 5.63% and mean reversion tendency. Tails are constrained by low volatility regime and lack of catalysts.

**Sensitivity check:** Shifting percentiles by ±10% would:
- -10%: Create implausibly tight distribution (5.51-5.72%), inconsistent with even low volatility
- +10%: Widen to 5.63-5.88%, more consistent with historical 2-week volatility but overstates current regime uncertainty

Current calibration balances recent stability with modest mean reversion potential.

Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** VA 30-year fixed mortgage index (OBMMIVA30YF) value on Feb 26, 2026, in percent units, 9-day forecast window.
   ✓ Analysis focuses exactly on this index and timeframe.

2. **Base rate anchoring:** Outside view median 5.68%, range 5.55-5.82%.
   ✓ Inside view (5.66%, range 5.57-5.80%) stays close to base rate with modest adjustments justified by very recent data and expert consensus.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 5.66%; mean ≈ 5.67%. 
   ✓ Makes sense: slight upward drift from Feb 12 value (5.633%) toward 30-day mean (5.70%), consistent with mean reversion in stable regime.

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - Feb 12 FRED value: 5.633% (authoritative, 5 days old)
   - 30-day volatility: 0.038 pp std dev (extremely low, stable regime)
   - Expert poll: 55% expect no change this week (identifiable experts, current)
   - Support at 5.63%: tested twice in 2 weeks (structural pattern)
   - No catalysts before Feb 26 (Fed calendar, economic releases)
   ✓ All factually verified from authoritative sources.

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Unexpected hawkish Fed communication or geopolitical shock causes MBS selloff, pushing rates up 15-20 bps to 5.80-5.85%. Would make forecast look too narrow/low. However, probability is low given no scheduled Fed events and current stable macro environment.

6. **Status quo outcome:** Current value is 5.633%. Given 9-day horizon and extremely low volatility, status quo bias suggests staying very close to this level. Median of 5.66% represents only 3 bp move, appropriate for this timeframe.
   ✓ Forecast appropriately conservative.

7. **Technicalities:** 
   ✓ Percentiles strictly increasing
   ✓ Units in percent (matching question)
   ✓ All values between bounds (4.79-7.52%)
