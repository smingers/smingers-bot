Analysis:
(a) Source analysis
- FRED series page (OBMMIVA30YF): Defines the VA 30-year fixed OBMMI index and that it’s based on actual rate locks. Very high-quality methodology source, but not predictive. Most relevant fact is the last observed value noted in the question background: 5.633 on 2026-02-12.
- Veterans United “VA mortgage rates today” (updated 2026-02-17): High-level explainer linking VA rates to inflation, Treasury yields, Fed stance, etc. Reasonable secondary source; mostly generalities and not directly quantifying the OBMMI VA index level.
- Bankrate “rate trends” (week of 2026-02-12 to 02-18): Reputable aggregator with a quantified 30-year fixed average (6.16% as of Feb 11) plus an expert poll for the week (majority expect no change). Useful near-term directional context, but it’s not the same instrument as OBMMI VA locks.
- Forbes Advisor mortgage rates (2026-02-16 and 2026-02-17): Reputable consumer finance reporting citing Mortgage Research Center; shows 30-year fixed around 6.02% and down week-over-week. Useful as “inside view” on direction over the next week, but again not the OBMMI VA index itself.
- CNBC (2026-01-21) on MBA applications: High-quality reporting; indicates rates hit lows then “suddenly jumping higher” (a warning/interpretation). Helpful for understanding that short-term reversals can occur, but dated ~4 weeks and not a point forecast.
- Yahoo Finance (2025-12-30) / Fortune (older): Medium relevance; contains longer-horizon forecasts (Fannie Mae/MBA expectations) and context that mortgage rates likely hover near ~6% through 2026. Too coarse for a 9-day forecast.
- RealEstateNews (2025-10-30): Old regime context; low weight for a 2026-02 end-of-window value.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighed)
Strong evidence
- Status-quo anchoring + low realized volatility: The series is daily and recently has moved in a tight band (per the outside-view analysis’ 30-day low volatility regime). In a 9-day window, persistence dominates absent a macro shock.

Moderate evidence
- Multiple near-dated mainstream rate trackers (Bankrate/Forbes) show 30-year conventional averages in the low 6% range and drifting slightly downward over the past week. This supports either “flat” or “slightly down” for VA locks too (VA typically prices below conventional).
- Inflation narrative (core CPI described as benign) + mentions of declining Treasury yields in the Bankrate writeup: consistent with mild downward pressure, but the pass-through to locked VA rates over just 9 days is limited and noisy.

Weak evidence
- Expert polls about the coming week (Bankrate): informative but not tightly mapped to OBMMI VA locks, and polls are often “no change” by default.
- Older 2025 articles about seasonal spikes and Fed cuts: low relevance for a specific 2026-02-26 daily print.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Forecast horizon: 9 days (from 2026-02-17 to 2026-02-26; last cited observation is 2026-02-12).
- If the horizon were halved (~4–5 days): I’d tighten the distribution around the latest print (even more “sticky”).
- If the horizon were doubled (~18 days): I’d widen tails materially (more exposure to CPI/PCE surprises, auctions, risk-off/risk-on swings affecting MBS spreads), and I’d allow a bit more mean reversion upward from a local low.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustments vs outside view)
Outside view (given): very tight, slightly right-skewed around the low-to-mid 5.6s, reflecting a recent floor near ~5.63 and limited catalysts.

Inside-view updates:
- Directional nudge slightly downward/flat: Near-term conventional averages (Forbes/Bankrate) softened over the last week and the inflation/10Y yield commentary is mildly supportive of stable-to-lower mortgage pricing. This modestly increases probability mass just below the 5.63 anchor (e.g., 5.55–5.62).
- But keep right-skew/tail-up risk: Being near a local low, and given occasional “snapbacks” in rates (CNBC/MBA narrative), the upside tail remains important even in a short window—especially if there’s an adverse rates move (Treasury selloff, wider MBS spreads, or risk premium jump). So I widen the 90th modestly versus the outside-view 5.83.

Distribution calibration
- (a) If the current micro-trend continued: slight drift down from 5.633 toward ~5.60–5.62 by Feb 26.
- (b) But status quo is powerful in daily lock-based indices: modal outcome remains “near 5.63–5.70.”
- (c) I widen 10th/90th relative to the very-low-vol regime to respect unknown unknowns (macro headline risk) while keeping the middle tight.
- (d) Sensitivity: shifting all percentiles up/down by 0.10 would materially change the story; given mixed “slightly down but near a floor” signals, I keep the median close to current levels.

Checklist:
1) Target: OBMMIVA30YF value (percent) published on FRED for 2026-02-26.
2) Outside-view base distribution (given): P10 5.52, P20 5.57, P40 5.63, P60 5.70, P80 5.77, P90 5.83.
3) Consistency: implied median ≈ (P40+P60)/2 = 5.66; mean slightly higher due to right tail; consistent with “sticky near 5.6s with some upside risk.”
4) Key evidence (most significant):
   - Latest known level ~5.633 (2026-02-12) and recent tight trading range (low realized volatility).
   - Broad 30-year conventional averages fell to ~6.02 recently (Forbes), suggesting no near-term upward shock.
   - Bankrate experts mostly expect “no change” this week; supports persistence.
   - Near-local-low asymmetry: easier to bounce up on a rates shock than to keep grinding down quickly.
5) Blind spot: a sharp Treasury selloff / MBS spread widening event could push the index up quickly (forecast would be too low).
6) Status quo outcome: close to 5.63 remains the single best anchor.
7) Technicalities: percentiles strictly increasing; units are Percent.
