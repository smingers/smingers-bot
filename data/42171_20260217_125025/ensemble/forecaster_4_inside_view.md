Analysis:
(a) Source analysis – highlights (all 2025-26, U​S unless noted).
1. FRED series page: definitive data provider; factual, daily values, latest 5.633 % on 12 Feb 26. -- High quality, no opinions.  
2. Optimal Blue press note (10 Feb 26): January VA‐30 yr average 5.64 %; confirms level and slow downward drift. – High quality, mild marketing bias, factual.  
3. Bankrate expert poll (week of 12-18 Feb 26): 55 % “flat”, 27 % “down”, 18 % “up”. Identifiable experts, gives consensus neutrality / slight bias lower. – Moderate quality.  
4. Forbes daily rate pieces (16-17 Feb 26): national 30-yr conforming dipped ~10 bp week-over-week to 6.02 %. Factual quotes from Mortgage Research Ctr. – Moderate quality, indirect but correlated.  
5. CNBC (21 Jan 26) & MBA data: refinance boom with 30-yr fixed conforming 6.16 %. Older but shows early-2026 easing trend. – Moderate quality.  
6. Legacy 2025 articles: context only, older macro narrative. – Weak relevance for 9-day horizon.

(b) Evidence weighting
• Strong: Latest official print 5.633 %; historical 1-wk σ ≈ 4 bp; shocks of ±30 bp in a fortnight observed a few times a year.  
• Moderate: January OBMMI VA value (5.64 %) almost identical to current – suggests flat trend.  
• Moderate: Multiple mainstream trackers show modest fall in conventional rates Feb 16-17 (≈10 bp).  
• Weak: Expert polls split; macro headlines abroad (UK, Korea) immaterial to U.S. VA locks inside a week.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Target date is nine calendar days (~7 trading days). If horizon halved (≈3-4 days) I would narrow the 10-90 range by ~25 %. If doubled (≈2 weeks) I would widen tails by ~25-30 bp.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Base-rate (outside view) median 5.68 % with 80 % range 5.40-5.98 %.  
Current data show continued gentle easing in mortgage and Treasury yields; no scheduled Fed decision before 26 Feb; CPI already out, PCE due morning of 26 Feb but historically moves ≤10 bp intraday. Hence I nudge the whole distribution down ~8 bp and trim width slightly on the low side while keeping room for a surprise spike (e.g., hot PCE, geopolitical jolt).  

Distribution calibration
I fit a symmetric-ish but slightly left-shifted distribution:

10th percentile: 5.35 %   (≈-28 bp vs last print)  
20th percentile: 5.48 %  
40th percentile: 5.58 %  
60th percentile: 5.67 %  
80th percentile: 5.80 %  
90th percentile: 5.95 %

Checklist:
1. Target: OBMMIVA30YF level on 26 Feb 26, percent. ✅  
2. Outside-view distribution stated and used as anchor. ✅  
3. Implied median ≈ 5.63 %; mean ≈ 5.66 % – consistent with rationale. ✅  
4. Key evidence: (i) latest print 5.633 %, (ii) January average 5.64 %, (iii) Feb 16-17 conventional rates -10 bp, (iv) Bankrate poll majority “flat/down”. ✅  
5. Blind-spot: shock rise in Treasury yields after hotter-than-expected PCE on 26 Feb, pushing rate >6 %. Would shift outcome up.  
6. Status-quo bias checked – distribution centred very close to current value. ✅  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, units in percent, within open bounds. ✅
