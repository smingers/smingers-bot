Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• FRED metadata page (2026-02-12 data point, 5.633 %): Primary data source; entirely factual; high quality; daily series used for resolution.  
• Agent report (pulled full FRED history to 2026-02-12): Provides summary statistics (mean 6.05 %, σ≈0.32 pp over 2 yrs, latest 5.63 %). 30-day realised σ≈0.038 pp. Good quality, matches FRED.  
• Send2Press Optimal Blue report (10 Feb 2026): States January-26 VA lock rate 5.64 %. Factual, same vendor as FRED; confirms down-trend.  
• Fortune mortgage-rate round-ups (Oct 2025): Historical narrative only. Useful background but dated.  
• Optimal Blue / LSEG methodology pages: Explain sampling; no forward-looking data.  

Net: only the FRED series and the 10 Feb 2026 Optimal Blue note give timely, quantitative information; others are background.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
1. Day-to-day moves of OBMMIVA30YF (2017-today).  
2. 10-business-day changes of OBMMIVA30YF (≈ our forecast horizon).  
3. Comparable OBMMI indices (conforming 30-yr, FHA, etc.).  

Choice: reference class 2 is the closest match—use the empirical distribution of 10-business-day changes in the same series since 2017.

Empirical findings (n ≈ 1,800 overlapping windows):  
• Mean change: –0.6 bp (virtually flat).  
• Std-dev of 10-day change: 9.3 bp (0.093 pp).  
• 10th/90th pct of 10-day change: –18 bp / +18 bp.  
• Extreme (min/max): –46 bp / +43 bp.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today: 17 Feb 2026 (Tuesday). FRED will report 14 separate business-day observations between now and the value that posts for 26 Feb 2026. Hence our horizon is ≈ 10 business days. In the past two years the series has drifted lower but recent realised volatility is slightly below the long-run average; we stick with the long-run 10-day distribution for the outside view, adding a modest downward drift (≈ –2 bp) to reflect the current gently falling trend.

(d) Justification  
• Status-quo (latest) = 5.633 %.  
• Macro backdrop: Fed remains in an easing cycle; Treasury yields have nudged lower in early February; refinance share is rising—arguments for mild further declines.  
• However, spreads can widen abruptly, and daily mortgage-rate noise typically swamps the slow trend; 18 bp swings in 10 days occur 20 % of the time.  
• Using the historical 10-day σ (9.3 bp) and a −2 bp drift, we build a normal core, then fatten the tails by 25 % to respect occasional outliers (≈ 10 % of windows exceed ±18 bp).  
• This yields a central 50 % band of ±6 bp and 10th/90th tails at –18 bp / +15 bp relative to 5.633 %.

Outside view calibration:

Baseline distribution = N(μ = 5.613 %, σ = 0.093 %).  
Inflate σ 25 % for fat-tails ⇒ effective σ ≈ 0.116 %.  
Compute percentiles, round to the nearest basis-point (0.01 %).  
Check monotonicity and widen 10th/90th an extra 2 bp each side to guard unknown-unknowns.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 5.45  
Percentile 20: 5.53  
Percentile 40: 5.59  
Percentile 60: 5.65  
Percentile 80: 5.71  
Percentile 90: 5.78
