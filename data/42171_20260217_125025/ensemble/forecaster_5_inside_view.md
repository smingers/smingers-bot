Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED series page (updated to 12 Feb 2026, last value 5.633 %). Primary data; no opinions; highest reliability.  
2. Bankrate “Rate Trends” 12 Feb 2026.  National-average 30-yr rate 6.16 %; quotes ten named experts.  Good quality, very recent.  Provides expectation that rates stay flat (55 %), down (27 %), up (18 %).  
3. Forbes daily rate articles 16-17 Feb 2026.  National 30-yr rate ≈ 6.02 – 6.06 % and still edging lower week-on-week by ≈ 10 bp. Solid factual figures, same data vendor each day.  
4. MBA refi report 21 Jan 2026 (CNBC).  Shows VA refinance boom when rates dipped to 6.16 % but warns of rates “jumping higher”.  Useful to gauge volatility but now four weeks old.  
5. Optimal Blue January press note (10 Feb 2026, not excerpted above).  States VA lock rate averaged 5.64 %.  Aligns with latest FRED print.  
6. Older (2025) background articles.  Give historical context only; dated >3 months; minimal weight.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• FRED daily data show 7-day-ahead changes normally distributed with σ≈8–9 bp and gentle downward drift (–3–4 bp).  
Moderate evidence  
• Two independent current-week sources (Bankrate, Forbes) record small (≈10 bp) declines in national 30-yr conforming rates—logical proxy for VA rates.  
• Majority of 10 named experts foresee flat rates during 17–18 Feb week; minority split roughly 3:1 toward decreases.  
Weak evidence  
• CNBC/MBA note about a possible “jump higher” (3 wks old) – market has since absorbed fresh CPI and Fed pause.  
• Macro calendar: no FOMC until March; only routine data releases—unlikely to trigger >15 bp moves.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Target is 9 calendar / 7 business days ahead.  Halving the horizon (3–4 days) would shrink σ by √½ → ≈6 bp; doubling (14 business days) would widen σ to ≈12 bp and tilt mean a touch lower if the current drift persisted.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Base distribution (μ 5.59 %, σ 10 bp) came from 10-day changes since 2024.  
Inside-view factors:  
• Fresh rate quotes show another ~4 bp drop since the last FRED print, supporting the downward drift.  
• Expert poll leans flat/down, limiting upside risk.  
• No scheduled macro catalyst before 26 Feb.  
Hence I nudge the mean up a hair to 5.60 % (assuming some of the recent 4 bp drop already posted in the yet-unpublished 13-17 Feb FRED prints) and keep σ slightly under the base 10 bp (use 9 bp) but widen the extreme tails 15 bp to reflect “unknown-unknown” data revisions.

Distribution calibration
Mean ≈ 5.60 %; σ ≈ 0.09 %.  
Mapped to a (roughly normal) percentile grid and then widened ±2 bp at each tail to cover model risk:

Percentile 10 ≈ 5.45 %  
20 ≈ 5.50 %  
40 ≈ 5.57 %  
60 ≈ 5.63 %  
80 ≈ 5.69 %  
90 ≈ 5.75 %

Checklist:
1. Target = OBMMIVA30YF value (percent) on 26 Feb 2026. ✓  
2. Outside view distribution stated and still anchor of forecast. ✓  
3. Implied median = 5.60 %; mean ≈ 5.60 %; consistent with rationale. ✓  
4. Key evidence: (i) FRED last print 5.633 %; (ii) 2-yr 7-day σ ≈ 9 bp; (iii) Forbes/Bankrate show 10 bp weekly decline; (iv) 55 % experts expect flat rates. ✓  
5. Blind-spot: sudden jump in 10-yr Treasury yields (>20 bp) after a surprise data print; would push outcome above 5.75 %.  
6. Status-quo bias kept: median only –3 bp from last observed value. ✓  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units = Percent. ✓
