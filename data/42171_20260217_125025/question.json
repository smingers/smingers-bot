    "description": "The Federal Reserve Economic Data database (FRED) provides economic data from national, international, public, and private sources. The series OBMMIVA30YF is a dataset that is tracked by the FRED API. It represents the 30-year fixed rate Veterans Affairs mortgage index. The title of the series is \"30-Year Fixed Rate Veterans Affairs Mortgage Index\". The last data point on the graph (as of creation of this question) is from 2026-02-12 and has a value of 5.633. The units of the series are \"Percent\". The update frequency of the series is \"Daily\". The seasonal adjustment of the series is \"Not Seasonally Adjusted\". An interactive graph for the series can be found [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/OBMMIVA30YF). Below are the notes attached to the series:\n\n> This index includes rate locks from U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs loans.\n> \n> Optimal Blue Mortgage Market Indices (https://www2.optimalblue.com/obmmi/)\u2122 (OBMMI\u2122) is calculated from actual locked rates with consumers across over one-third of all mortgage transactions nationwide. OBMMI includes multiple mortgage pricing indices developed around the most popular products and specific borrower and loan level attributes.\n> \n> Each index is calculated as the average of all appropriate rate locks locked through the Optimal Blue product eligibility and pricing engine on a given day. More details about methodology and definitions are available here (https://www2.optimalblue.com/obmmi/).\n\n`{\"format\":\"fred_value_at_time\",\"info\":{\"series_id\":\"OBMMIVA30YF\"}}`",

The latest revised data will be used when the resolution is assessed. The datapoint matching 2026-02-26 will be used to determine the resolution of this question.\n\nA datapoint matches if:\n1. The series is updated daily and the date of the datapoint is within 1 day previous to the resolution date.\n2. The series is updated weekly and the date of the datapoint is within 7 days previous to the resolution date.\n3. The series is updated monthly and the date of the datapoint is within 31 days previous to the resolution date.\n\nIf the datapoint is clearly skipped, or no datapoint is found after 2 weeks of checking then the question will be annulled.",
