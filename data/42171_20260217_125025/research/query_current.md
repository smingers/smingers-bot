Analysis:
To forecast the 30-Year Fixed Rate Veterans Affairs Mortgage Index (OBMMI VA 30Y) for 2026-02-26, the most valuable near-term information will be:
• Daily or weekly releases from Optimal Blue or FRED that show the latest index prints and short-term trend (direction, magnitude, volatility).  
• Commentary from mortgage-market analysts, banks, and real-estate news outlets on drivers of VA mortgage rates—e.g., Treasury yield moves, Fed policy expectations, MBS spreads, and any VA-specific pricing changes.  
• Broader mortgage-rate stories that often cite OBMMI figures when discussing current conditions; these pieces can provide context on whether rates are drifting up, down, or sideways in mid-to-late February 2026.  
Therefore, search terms should target the exact index name (OBMMI VA 30-year), VA mortgage rate commentary, and general U.S. mortgage-rate trend articles dated within the last few days.
