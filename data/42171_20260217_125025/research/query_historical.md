Analysis:
To estimate the 30-Year Fixed Rate Veterans Affairs Mortgage Index (OBMMIVA30YF) on 2026-02-26 I first need a clear statistical picture of its recent behavior—level, trend and day-to-day volatility. The most direct source is the FRED historical series itself; supplementary context (e.g., Optimal Blue press releases or financial-press coverage of VA mortgage rates) helps gauge whether unusual market events are affecting the series. Therefore, I will:
• Pull the full FRED history of OBMMIVA30YF, then zoom in on the last 6–24 months to compute averages and standard deviations of daily moves.  
• Check recent news or commentary about VA mortgage rate movements or special factors (policy, bond-market swings) that could influence the index in the next week.  
• Look for methodology notes from Optimal Blue describing how quickly the index reflects market changes.
