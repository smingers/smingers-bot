This represents the lowest annual core inflation reading since March 2021.\n\n2. **Rate Characteristics:** VA loan rates change daily based on market conditions and can change frequently, sometimes even multiple times a day.\n\n3. **Rate Lock Periods:** Rate locks typically range from 30 to 60 days and guarantee a set interest rate for that specific time period.\n\n## Factors Influencing VA Loan Rates:\n\nThe article identifies several factors that shape VA loan interest rates:\n- Credit scores (better credit typically means lower rates)\n- Federal funds rate (set by the Federal Reserve, though it only indirectly impacts mortgage rates)\n- Long-term bond yields like the 10-year Treasury note (more directly tied to mortgage rates)\n- Inflation expectations\n- Economic growth\n- Investor behavior\n- Global economic conditions\n- Housing market trends\n- Secondary mortgage market conditions\n- Job growth\n\n## General Information:\n\n- VA loan rates are typically lower than other major loan types (FHA and conventional mortgages) due to VA backing\n- Private lenders set the actual interest rates based on economic conditions; the VA does not set rates but backs a portion of each loan\n- VA refinance rates often differ from VA purchase loan rates\n- The article notes that a Fed rate cut doesn't guarantee mortgage rates will immediately decrease\n\n**Note:** The article appears to be cut off at the end and does not provide specific current rate values for the VA 30-year fixed rate mortgage index.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/OBMMIVA30YF\">\n## Summary of Article\n\n**Source:** FRED (Federal Reserve Economic Data) - St. Louis Federal Reserve\n\n**Key Information:**\n\n### Facts and Objective Details:\n- **Series ID:** OBMMIVA30YF\n- **Title:** 30-Year Fixed Rate Veterans Affairs Mortgage Index\n- **Units:** Percent\n- **Frequency:** Daily updates\n- **Seasonal Adjustment:** Not Seasonally Adjusted\n- **Data Source:** Optimal Blue Mortgage Market Indices (OBMMI\u2122)\n\n### Methodology:\n- The index includes rate locks from U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs loans specifically\n- Calculated from actual locked rates with consumers across over one-third of all mortgage transactions nationwide\n- Each index value represents the average of all appropriate rate locks processed through the Optimal Blue product eligibility and pricing engine on a given day\n- OBMMI includes multiple mortgage pricing indices developed around the most popular products and specific borrower and loan level attributes\n\n### Additional Notes:\n- More detailed methodology and definitions are available at the Optimal Blue website\n- All data are subject to revision\n\n---\n\n**Disclaimer:** This article is primarily a technical description of the data series from the FRED database.

The 30-year fixed mortgage APR also declined to 6.04% from 6.15% a week earlier. For a $100,000 loan, borrowers would pay $601 per month in principal and interest, with total interest of $116,834 over the loan term. The 15-year fixed mortgage rate dropped to 5.21%, a 0.09 percentage point decrease from the prior week's 5.3%, with an APR of 5.25%. Monthly payments for a $100,000 15-year loan would be $802, totaling $44,689 in interest. Jumbo mortgage rates rose slightly to 6.5%, up 0.02 percentage points. The Federal Reserve held the federal funds rate steady at 3.50% to 3.75% during its January 28, 2026, FOMC meeting, pausing further cuts amid economic data assessment. Mortgage rates are influenced by Treasury yields, inflation, economic health, and Fed policy. A rate drop is unlikely in the near term unless inflation eases or the economy weakens. Borrowers can lower rates by improving credit scores (670+), maintaining a DTI below 43%, making a 20% down payment to avoid PMI, choosing shorter loan terms, or purchasing discount points. Rates change daily based on market conditions, and borrowers can lock in rates for 30 to 120 days. Fixed-rate mortgages offer stability, while ARMs may suit short-term homeowners or those expecting income growth.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 10:00 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-02-17-26/)\n\n**Here Are Today's Mortgage Refinance Rates: February 17, 2026 - No Movement On Rates**\nOn February 17, 2026, mortgage refinance rates remained stable, with the 30-year fixed-rate refinance average at 6.06%, down 0.10 percentage points from 6.16% the previous week. The 15-year fixed-rate refinance average was 5.15%, a 0.12-point decrease from 5.27% the prior week, while the 20-year fixed-rate refinance average stood at 6.00%, down 0.06 points from 6.06%. The 30-year jumbo mortgage refinance rate increased to 6.57% from 6.49%, and the 15-year jumbo rate decreased to 5.84%. For a $100,000 loan, monthly principal and interest payments were $603 for a 30-year refinance, $716 for a 20-year, $798 for a 15-year, and $637 for a 30-year jumbo. Total interest over the loan term ranged from $44,093 (15-year) to $117,809 (30-year). Refinance rates are typically higher than purchase rates due to lender risk, and closing costs range from 2% to 6% of the loan. Experts project national rates to remain in the low-to-mid 6% range through early 2026, with potential declines if the Federal Reserve continues rate cuts. Homeowners are advised to improve credit, reduce debt, and monitor rates to secure the best terms. A break-even analysis is recommended to assess refinancing viability. Lenders typically require at least 20% equity (80% loan-to-value ratio) for favorable terms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 10:00 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/refinance/mortgage-refinance-rates-02-17-26/)\n\n**UK households urged to lock mortgage rate in before inflation announcement - Birmingham Live**\nUK homeowners are being urged to lock in their mortgage rates ahead of the Office for National Statistics (ONS) release of the consumer price index (CPI) for the 12 months to January 2026, scheduled for Wednesday, February 18, 2026. The Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) previously raised the base rate to 5.25%, prompting mortgage brokers to advise proactive action. Louis Mason, content and communications director at Oportfolio Mortgages, cautioned against overreaction, describing recent lender adjustments as cautious 'toe-dipping' rather than major shifts. Richard Davidson, a mortgage advisor at onlinemortgageadvisor.co.uk, emphasized locking in rates when possible, citing the unpredictability of market conditions. Santander reduced fixed mortgage rates for first-time buyers at 85%, 90%, and 95% loan-to-value (LTV) by up to 0.32%, with some other fixed rates cut by up to 0.08%, while certain home mover and remortgage products at lower LTVs saw slight increases. Nationwide Building Society also cut fixed mortgage rates by up to 0.16 percentage points, bringing its lowest rate down to 3.54%. These changes affect a broad range of two-, three-, and five-year fixed-rate products, with existing and new customers moving house seeing reductions of up to 0.15%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 09:06 AM\nSource:[Birmingham Mail](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/money/uk-households-urged-lock-mortgage-33438110)\n\n**Mortgage Rates Near 7%: 'Young Leveragers' Face Growing Financial Pressure**\nSouth Korea's major commercial banks\u2014KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Hana, Woori, and NH Nonghyup\u2014have seen their 5-year fixed-rate mortgage interest rates rise to 4.36%\u20136.74% as of February 13, 2026, with the upper end nearing 7%. Variable-rate mortgages have also climbed to the 3.5%\u20136.1% range, increasing financial pressure on borrowers. This rise is driven by higher benchmark rates, including a 3.687% yield on 5-year AAA-rated financial bonds (up 0.188 percentage points from 3.499% at the end of 2025) and a 2.89% COFIX (funding cost index) in December 2025, up 0.08 percentage points from the previous month. With the Bank of Korea's rate-cutting cycle effectively concluded and continued household loan regulations, further mortgage rate increases are expected. This poses heightened financial strain on 'young people who leveraged everything' (\uc601\ub04c\uc871), who took out loans at 2% rates five years ago but now face refinancing at 4%\u20135% rates. In response, financial regulators are considering introducing long-term fixed-rate mortgage products with 30-year terms. However, currently, fixed-rate mortgages are priced higher than variable-rate ones, leading borrowers to continue favoring variable-rate options to reduce interest burden.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 05:07 AM\nSource:[\uc778\ud130\ub137\ub274\uc2a4 \ud55c\uacbd\ub2f7\ucef4](https://www.hankyung.com/article/2026021784207)\n\n**'How Will We Live From Now On?'... 'Young People Who Leveraged Everything' Face Crisis as Mortgage Rates Approach 7%**\nSouth Korea's major commercial banks\u2014KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Hana, Woori, and NH Nonghyup\u2014have seen their fixed-rate mortgage (home loan) interest rates reach up to 6.74% as of February 13, 2026, nearing the 7% threshold. This marks a significant increase from the previous year, driven by rising benchmark financial instrument rates, including the 5-year AAA corporate bond yield (3.687%, up 0.188 percentage points from 3.499% in December 2024) and the COFIX (funding cost index), which rose to 2.89% in December 2024, continuing a four-month upward trend since September 2024. The Bank of Korea\u2019s rate-cutting cycle has effectively ended, and continued tightening of household loan regulations is expected to keep mortgage rates elevated. This has intensified financial pressure on 'Young People Who Leveraged Everything' (\uc601\ub04c\uc871), borrowers who secured loans at near-2% rates five years ago, now facing potential rate resets to 4\u20135% or higher. In response, financial regulators are considering introducing 30-year fixed-rate mortgage products to provide long-term stability. However, due to higher fixed rates, borrowers are increasingly opting for variable-rate loans: the share of variable-rate home loans rose to 13.4% in December 2025 (up from 9.8% in November), the highest level since December 2024, while variable-rate loans now account for 51.1% of all household loans, down from 53.2% in December 2024 but still above half.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 02:26 AM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/economy/11964197)\n\n**All-Cash Home Purchases Ended 2025 at Five-Year Low**\nIn December 2025, 29% of U.S. homebuyers paid in all cash, the lowest December share since 2020 and down from 30.3% in December 2024. This decline follows the drop in mortgage rates from their 2023 peak of over 7%, reducing the incentive for buyers to pay cash to avoid high interest. The current average 30-year fixed mortgage rate is 6.09%. The strong buyer's market\u2014where sellers outnumber buyers by a record 47%\u2014has given buyers negotiating power, reducing the need to offer cash to win homes. Despite this, cash offers remain attractive to sellers in areas like Texas and Florida, where homes sit on the market for months, as cash deals close faster. Redfin Premier agent Amanda Peterson noted that cash buyers can often secure homes 10-20% below appraised value. Meanwhile, FHA loan usage fell to 14.4% in December 2025, the lowest since 2021, due to high closing costs\u2014including prepaid taxes, mortgage insurance, and rising HOA fees\u2014discouraging low-to-moderate-income buyers despite lower FHA rates. Conventional loans were used by 78.6% of mortgaged buyers, the highest December share since 2021. VA loans rose slightly to 7% of mortgaged purchases. Metro-level data shows all-cash purchases were highest in West Palm Beach, FL (47.2%), and lowest in Seattle (17.3%). FHA loans were most common in Riverside, CA (25.6%), and least in San Francisco (1.1%). VA loans were most prevalent in Virginia Beach, VA (36.8%), and least in San Francisco (0.7%). Conventional loans dominated in San Francisco (98.1%) and were least common in Virginia Beach (47%).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 01:30 PM\nSource:[Business Wire](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20260216380726/en/All-Cash-Home-Purchases-Ended-2025-at-Five-Year-Low)\n\n**Here Are Today's Mortgage Refinance Rates: February 16, 2026 - Rates Remain Stable**\nOn February 16, 2026, mortgage refinance rates remained stable, with the average 30-year fixed refinance rate at 6.06%, down 0.13 percentage points from the previous week. The 15-year fixed refinance rate averaged 5.15%, a 0.14-point decrease from last week, while the 20-year fixed rate was 6.00%, down 0.08 points. The 30-year jumbo refinance rate rose to 6.57% from 6.51%, and the 15-year jumbo rate dropped to 5.84%. For a $100,000 loan, a 30-year refinance would cost $603 monthly in principal and interest, with $117,809 in total interest over the loan\u2019s life. A 15-year refinance would cost $798 monthly and $44,093 in total interest. Refinance rates are generally higher than mortgage rates and vary by loan type, with government-backed loans like FHA and VA typically offering lower rates. Experts expect minimal movement in national average rates during early 2026, with inflation and unemployment trends influencing future direction. To secure the best rates, borrowers are advised to improve credit scores, reduce debt-to-income ratios, monitor rate trends, and consider shorter loan terms. Closing costs typically range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount, and refinancing is most beneficial for those planning to stay in their home long-term.

For a $100,000 loan, monthly principal and interest payments are approximately $601, with total interest over the loan\u2019s life estimated at $116,834. The 15-year fixed mortgage rate decreased to 5.21% (down 0.12 percentage points), with an APR of 5.25%, resulting in a monthly payment of $802 and $44,689 in total interest. Conversely, the 30-year jumbo mortgage rate rose slightly to 6.50% (up from 6.49%), leading to a monthly payment of $632 and $127,947 in total interest. The Federal Reserve held the federal funds rate steady at 3.50%\u20133.75% at its January 28, 2026, FOMC meeting, pausing further cuts amid economic data evaluation. Mortgage rates are influenced by the Fed\u2019s policy, U.S. Treasury yields, inflation, and borrower-specific factors such as credit score and debt-to-income ratio. A good mortgage rate is generally considered to be at or below the mid-6% range for 30-year fixed loans. Experts note that while rates may decline if inflation cools or the economy weakens, a return to 3% levels is unlikely in the near term. The APR reflects the total cost of borrowing, including fees, and is typically higher than the interest rate. Borrowers are advised to compare multiple lenders within a 45-day window to avoid credit score damage and secure the best terms. Despite elevated rates and low housing inventory, strategic financial preparation\u2014such as maintaining a credit score above 670, a DTI below 43%, and a 20% down payment\u2014can improve access to competitive rates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 10:05 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-02-16-26/)\n\n**Current refi mortgage rates report for Feb. 16, 2026 | Fortune**\nAccording to a Fortune report based on Zillow data as of February 13, 2026, mortgage refinance rates remain near 7% for 30-year fixed-rate loans, despite Federal Reserve rate cuts in late 2024 and early 2025. Although rates began trending downward in late August and early September 2025\u2014preceding the Fed\u2019s first rate cut on September 16\u201317\u2014many homeowners remain locked in lower rates from the pandemic era, with 82.8% of mortgaged homeowners having rates below 6% as of Q3 2024. Refinancing may be worthwhile if a borrower can secure a rate at least one percentage point lower than their current rate, such as moving from 7% to 6%. Additional reasons to refinance include tapping home equity via a cash-out refinance (requiring at least 20% equity), switching loan terms (e.g., from 15- to 30-year), changing loan types (e.g., from FHA to conventional to eliminate mortgage insurance), or converting an adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) to a fixed-rate mortgage to avoid future rate hikes. Refinancing costs range from 2% to 6% of the loan amount\u2014$6,000 to $18,000 on a $300,000 loan\u2014and include lender origination fees, appraisal fees, title and insurance fees, application fees, survey fees, attorney fees (if required), recording fees, and potential prepayment penalties. Available refinance options include rate-and-term refinances (most common), cash-out refinances, no-closing-cost refinances (with higher interest rates), streamline refinances (for FHA, VA, and USDA borrowers), and programs like Refi Now and Refi Possible for loans owned by Fannie Mae or Freddie Mac. Borrowers are encouraged to compare lenders, as existing lenders may offer incentives such as waived closing costs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 08:01 AM\nSource:[Fortune](https://fortune.com/article/current-refi-mortgage-rates-02-16-2026/)\n\n**Current mortgage rates on [DATE] | Fortune**\nAs of February 16, 2026, mortgage rates in the U.S. remain elevated, with the average 30-year fixed-rate mortgage surpassing 7% for the first time since May 2024, according to Freddie Mac data. This marks a significant departure from the historic low of 2.65% recorded in January 2021. Despite expectations that the Federal Reserve\u2019s rate cuts starting in September 2025 would lower mortgage rates, the decline only began after the Fed delivered its first rate cut on September 16\u201317, 2025, followed by two additional quarter-point reductions in October and December 2025. Experts note that rates around 7% are not historically abnormal\u2014comparable to the 1990s and far below the 18%+ rates seen in the early 1980s. However, the current high rates have created a phenomenon known as 'golden handcuffs,' where homeowners are locked into low pandemic-era rates and reluctant to move. Factors influencing mortgage rates include inflation fears, national debt, loan demand, and the Federal Reserve\u2019s actions\u2014particularly its shift from quantitative tightening (which ended in December 2025) to a more accommodative stance. To secure the best rate, borrowers are advised to maintain excellent credit (740+ for top-tier rates), keep debt-to-income ratios below 36%, and compare offers from multiple lenders, including banks, credit unions, and online providers. Freddie Mac research indicates that shopping around can save borrowers $600 to $1,200 annually in high-rate environments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 08:01 AM\nSource:[Fortune](https://fortune.com/article/current-mortgage-rates-02-16-2026/)\n\n**Mortgage refinances surged again, but rates are now suddenly jumping higher**\nMortgage refinancing applications surged 20% in the week ending January 21, 2026, marking the second consecutive week of significant growth, according to the Mortgage Bankers Association (MBA) seasonally adjusted index. This follows a 183% increase compared to the same week in 2025. The average contract interest rate for 30-year fixed-rate mortgages with conforming loan balances ($832,750 or less) declined to 6.16% from 6.18%, with points dropping to 0.54 from 0.56, including origination fees, for loans with a 20% down payment\u2014representing the lowest rate since September 2024. Joel Kan, MBA's vice president and deputy chief economist, stated, 'Mortgage rates declined further last week, driving another big week for refinance applications, which saw the strongest level of activity since September 2025.' Refinance activity accounted for over 60% of all applications, with conventional refinances up 29% and VA refinances up 26%. However, the article warns that 'this boom may be about to bust' as interest rates are now 'suddenly jumping higher.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 21, 2026 12:00 PM\nSource:[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/21/mortgage-refinances-surged-again-but-rates-are-now-suddenly-jumping-higher.html)\n\n**Mortgage and refinance interest rates today, December 30, 2025: Slipping below 6%**\nOn December 30, 2025, mortgage interest rates in the U.S. slipped below 6%, with the national average 30-year fixed rate at 5.99% for home purchases and 6.10% for refinances, according to Zillow data cited by Yahoo Finance. The 15-year fixed rate averaged 5.49% for purchases and 5.59% for refinances. Other rates included: 20-year fixed at 5.95% (purchase) and 5.92% (refinance), 5/1 ARM at 6.10% (purchase) and 6.31% (refinance), and VA loan rates ranging from 5.09% (15-year VA purchase) to 5.47% (5/1 VA refinance). Refinance rates are generally higher than purchase rates. The article explains that 15-year mortgages offer lower interest rates and long-term savings but higher monthly payments, while adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) have lower initial rates but risk rate increases after the fixed period. Economists predict mortgage rates will remain near 6% through 2026, with Fannie Mae forecasting a drop to 5.9% in Q4 2026 and 5.9% for all of 2027, while the MBA forecasts rates near 6.4% through 2027. The Federal Reserve is expected to cut the federal funds rate possibly twice in 2026 and once in 2027, but no drastic declines are anticipated before 2027.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 30, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The 15-year fixed rate decreased by six basis points to 5.52%. Refinance rates were slightly higher than purchase rates, with the 30-year fixed refinance rate at 6.15%. According to Zillow data, other current rates include: 20-year fixed at 6.01%, 5/1 ARM at 6.19%, 7/1 ARM at 6.44%, and VA loan rates ranging from 5.24% (15-year VA) to 5.73% (30-year VA). The stability in rates is welcomed by borrowers seeking predictable financing. Experts note that while 30-year fixed mortgages offer lower monthly payments and rate predictability, they result in higher total interest over time. In contrast, 15-year fixed loans have lower rates and interest costs but higher monthly payments. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) offer lower introductory rates but carry the risk of rate increases after the initial fixed period. Economists project minimal rate drops before late 2026, with only one anticipated federal funds rate cut in 2026 and possibly another in 2027. Borrowers can reduce their refinance rates by improving credit scores, lowering debt-to-income ratios, or refinancing into shorter terms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 17, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

Refinance rates are slightly higher, with the 30-year fixed refinance rate at 6.19%. Other rates include: 20-year fixed at 6.08%, 5/1 ARM at 6.24%, 7/1 ARM at 6.31%, and VA loan rates ranging from 5.14% (15-year VA) to 5.67% (30-year VA). These figures are national averages rounded to the nearest hundredth. The article notes that refinance rates are often higher than purchase rates. A comparison of a $300,000 mortgage shows that a 30-year term at 6.13% results in a monthly payment of $1,824 and $356,569 in total interest, while a 15-year term at 5.53% yields a $2,456 monthly payment and only $142,085 in interest. The article advises borrowers to improve credit scores, increase down payments, and reduce debt-to-income ratios to secure lower rates. It also recommends preapproving with three to four lenders within a short timeframe to minimize credit score impact and to compare APRs, not just interest rates, for the most accurate cost assessment. Despite expectations of minor fluctuations, mortgage rates are not anticipated to drop significantly in the near term.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 14, 2025 11:00 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

Despite persistently high mortgage rates\u2014averaging 6.125% for a 30-year fixed mortgage (APR: 6.263%), 5.875% for a 30-year FHA (APR: 6.564%), 6.125% for a 20-year fixed (APR: 6.356%), and 5.500% for a 15-year fixed (APR: 5.773%)\u2014strategic choices in loan terms can significantly impact affordability and long-term equity. Shorter-term mortgages offer lower interest rates but higher monthly payments, accelerating equity growth. Longer-term loans, like the proposed 50-year mortgage under federal consideration, reduce monthly payments and improve accessibility, especially for low-income buyers, though critics note slow equity accumulation. VA home loans, which require no down payment due to government backing, are available to eligible veterans and service members. Key factors influencing loan approval and rate include credit scores (with borrowers in the 700\u2013800 range receiving significantly better terms), down payments, debt-to-income ratios, and documentation such as tax returns and earnings statements. The article emphasizes that preparing financially\u2014by improving credit, reducing debt, and stabilizing income\u2014can make the difference between loan approval and delay. Lenders\u2019 rates vary, but personal financial health remains the most impactful determinant.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 07:30 AM\nSource:[Home Business Magazine](https://homebusinessmag.com/blog/financing/smart-financing-options-fuel-next-wave-homeownership/)\n\n**Mortgage rates today: 30-year holds at 6.16%, near year's lows  --  will steady borrowing costs spark a late-year rush to refinance?**\nOn November 12, 2025, mortgage rates remained stable near their 2025 lows, with the average 30-year fixed rate at 6.16% and the 15-year fixed at 5.61%. Refinance rates were slightly higher at 6.33%, while 15-year refinance rates averaged 5.82%. The Federal Reserve\u2019s potential future rate cuts in 2026 have created cautious optimism, but experts expect little dramatic movement before year-end due to mixed economic signals\u2014cooling inflation paired with strong consumer spending and employment. Fixed-rate loans remain the most popular choice for long-term stability, with the 30-year fixed offering predictable payments and the 15-year fixed appealing to those seeking faster equity buildup and lower total interest. Adjustable-rate mortgages (ARMs) are less attractive, with 5/1 ARM rates at 6.54% and 7/1 ARM at 6.51%, higher than fixed options, reflecting market expectations of limited near-term rate drops. Refinancing activity has increased slightly, and experts advise borrowers to improve credit scores, reduce debt-to-income ratios, and compare multiple lenders to secure even a 0.25% rate reduction, which could save thousands over the loan\u2019s life. VA loan rates remain competitive, with 30-year terms at 5.61% and 15-year at 5.35%. Despite not reaching the ultra-low rates of 2020, current levels\u2014well below the 2023 peak of 7.5%\u2014are seen as a sustainable 'new normal' for the housing market, prompting many to act now rather than wait for uncertain future declines.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 12, 2025 12:44 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/mortgage-rates-today-nov-12-2025-30-year-holds-at-6-16-near-years-lows-will-steady-borrowing-costs-spark-a-late-year-rush-to-refinance/articleshow/125274432.cms)\n\n**Mortgage refinance rates today: 30-year fixed rate stands at 6.39%, 15-year at 5.4% -- When will mortgage rates finally drop?**\nMortgage refinance rates in the U.S. edged slightly lower on November 11, 2025, with the 30-year fixed refinance rate at 6.39% (up from 6.36% the previous week) and the 15-year fixed rate holding steady at 5.4%. Zillow data shows slightly lower averages: 6.33% for 30-year, 6.30% for 20-year, and 5.82% for 15-year fixed refinances. At 6.39%, a $100,000 30-year refinance results in a $625 monthly payment and $125,536 in lifetime interest. The 15-year fixed at 5.4% costs $812 monthly with $46,522 in total interest. Jumbo refinances saw a 30-year rate drop to 6.7% and a 15-year rate rise to 6.06%. Home purchase rates are slightly lower: 30-year fixed at 6.16%, 15-year at 5.61%, with VA-backed loans offering lower rates (e.g., 5.61% for 30-year VA). Experts predict rates will remain in the mid-6% range through 2025, with potential declines in 2026 if inflation cools and unemployment remains stable. The Federal Reserve\u2019s recent 25-basis-point cut and a 64% chance of another in December may influence future drops. Borrowers are advised to maintain strong credit and low debt-to-income ratios to qualify for favorable rates. Refinancing can lower payments, shorten terms, or access equity, but closing costs must be weighed against savings. A 15-year loan saves more in interest but requires higher monthly payments, while extra principal payments on a 30-year loan can reduce interest without changing the term. ARMs now start at higher rates than fixed loans, reducing their appeal. Overall, analysts expect minimal movement in mortgage rates for the remainder of 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 11, 2025 12:11 PM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/us/mortgage-refinance-rates-today-november-11-2025-30-year-fixed-rate-stands-at-6-39-15-year-at-5-4-when-will-mortgage-rates-finally-drop/articleshow/125248702.cms)\n\n**Mortgage applications increase as rates fall to 12-month low**\nMortgage applications rose as rates fell to a 12\u2011month low.
