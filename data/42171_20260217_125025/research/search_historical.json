No adjustments are made for buy-up or buy-down decisions made by individual borrowers.\n\n4. **Product Coverage**: The indices cover multiple mortgage products including:\n   - Conventional 30-year and 15-year fixed rate mortgages\n   - FHA loans\n   - USDA loans\n   - VA (Veterans Affairs) loans\n   - Jumbo loans\n   - Detailed indices based on Loan-to-Value (LTV) and FICO credit scores\n\n5. **Customer Breakdown**: Customers are categorized as:\n   - Mortgage companies: 82.49%\n   - Banks: 15.30%\n   - Credit unions: 1.92%\n   - Service providers: 0.30%\n\n6. **Data Exclusions**: Weekends and holidays are excluded from the indices due to lack of data.\n\n### Additional Context:\n\nThe article emphasizes that OBMMI provides transparency into mortgage rates using \"observed, real-time lock data\" rather than estimates or surveys, positioning it as delivering \"the most complete, frequent, and informative view of the mortgage rate environment based solely on observed, real-time transactions.\"\n\nThe article also includes terms of use information for accessing and sharing OBMMI data.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/FRED-OBMMIJUMBO30YF/\">\n# Summary of Article\n\n**Disclaimer**: The extracted content appears to be incomplete and consists primarily of navigation elements and metadata from a TradingView page rather than substantive article content.\n\n## Key Information Extracted:\n\n**About the Series (OBMMIJUMBO30YF - Note: This is for JUMBO mortgages, not VA mortgages)**:\n- **Category**: Housing\n- **Source**: Optimal Blue\n- **Frequency**: Daily\n- **Units**: Percent (%)\n\n**Content Limitations**:\nThe extracted content does not contain any:\n- Actual data values or statistics\n- Analysis or forecasts\n- Expert opinions\n- Historical trends or patterns\n- Information specifically about the VA mortgage index (OBMMIVA30YF)\n\nThe page appears to be primarily a data visualization interface showing related economic indicators in the housing sector, including various mortgage rates, home prices, and housing market indices.

Trend narrative  \n\u2022 Early-2024 (Feb \u2192 May): The index oscillated around 6.6 %\u20136.8 % as mortgage markets reacted to still-elevated inflation and a 10-year Treasury yield near 4.3 %.  \n\u2022 Mid-2024 (Jun \u2192 Oct): Rates drifted higher, peaking at 6.97 % on 2024-10-21 after a string of stronger-than-expected CPI and payroll prints.  \n\u2022 Late-2024 (Nov \u2192 Dec): The first FOMC rate cut on 2024-09-18 and further cuts in November and December triggered a decisive down-move. By year-end the VA 30-year rate had fallen to 5.94 %. (Optimal Blue September-2024 Market Advantage report corroborates the rate rally \u2013 Optimal Blue, 08 Oct 2024).  \n\u2022 2025: Momentum remained downward but choppy. A brief stall in March (6.55 %) was followed by a faster slide after the third Fed cut in September 2025; the index ended the year at 5.70 %. (Optimal Blue September-2025 Market Advantage \u2013 Send2Press, 14 Oct 2025).  \n\u2022 Early-2026: Additional investor demand for MBS and sub-6 % conventional rates continued to pressure VA rates lower. January\u2019s Optimal Blue report shows VA lock rates at 5.64 % (NonStop Local, 10 Feb 2026). The FRED series confirms the decline, printing 5.63 % on 2026-02-12 \u2013 the lowest reading in almost two years.\n\nOverall trajectory: a clear cyclical peak in October 2024, followed by a nearly monotonic fall of 134 bps to February 2026. The slope of the 200-day moving average turned negative in December 2024 and has stayed negative; the 50-day MA crossed below the 200-day MA (\u201cbear-to-bull\u201d crossover) in July 2025, underscoring the regime shift toward lower rates.\n\n4.

Implications for forecasting 2026-02-26 value  \nThe index is currently in a stable, gently declining channel; realised volatility is low and Fed policy guidance remains easing-biased. Forward-looking indicators (Optimal Blue January-2026 Market Advantage) point to additional spread compression as refinance demand revives, suggesting further\u2014but modest\u2014downside potential before month-end.\n\n6. Information gaps / further needs  \n\u2022 FRED usually publishes with a two-business-day lag; values after 2026-02-12 are not yet available. Up-to-date figures through the forecast date (2026-02-26) will be required for model calibration.  \n\u2022 Treasury yield curve data and mortgage-backed security (MBS) primary-secondary spreads should be incorporated to refine the volatility estimate and produce a point forecast.  \n\u2022 A full set of daily observations is necessary to recompute rolling volatility and moving averages up to the most recent print once data are posted.\n\nNo other critical data deficiencies were detected; the current dataset is otherwise complete for the past two years.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"OBMMIVA30YF\" query=\"OBMMIVA30YF\">\nFRED Economic Data: 30-Year Fixed Rate Veterans Affairs Mortgage Index\nSeries ID: OBMMIVA30YF\nUnits: Percent\nFrequency: Daily\nLatest observation: 5.63 (2026-02-12)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=6.07, min=5.63, max=6.57\n- 5-year: mean=5.45, min=2.59, max=7.49\n- 10-year: mean=4.72, min=2.35, max=7.49\n- All-time: mean=4.72, min=2.35, max=7.49 (since 2017-01-03)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: -0.00 (-0.1%)\n- 3-month change: -0.20 (-3.4%)\n- 6-month change: -0.49 (-8.0%)\n- Year-over-year: 5.63 vs 6.47 (-12.9%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-28,5.70\n2026-01-29,5.70\n2026-01-30,5.64\n2026-02-02,5.69\n2026-02-03,5.72\n2026-02-04,5.74\n2026-02-05,5.70\n2026-02-06,5.70\n2026-02-09,5.74\n2026-02-10,5.70\n2026-02-11,5.69\n2026-02-12,5.63\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
