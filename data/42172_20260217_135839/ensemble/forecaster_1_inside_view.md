**AskNews Articles (Feb 15-17, 2026):**
Multiple sources reporting:
- CNN/Spanish sources: US lacks post-regime-change plan, IRGC would fill power vacuum
- Chinese sources: A-10s and F-15Es deployed, Iran consulting China/Russia
- Israeli sources: Trump greenlit potential Israeli strikes on Iranian missile sites (not direct US action)
- Russian sources: Military expert predicts strikes possible but US not ready for retaliation
- Quality: MIXED - Some are translations, some cite anonymous sources, varying credibility

**Critical factual consensus across sources:**
1. Second round of talks occurred/scheduled for Feb 17-18 in Geneva (confirmed by multiple sources)
2. Significant US military buildup ongoing (carriers, F-15s, cargo flights)
3. Iran refuses to negotiate on missiles, willing to discuss nuclear limits
4. Trump making threats but also pursuing diplomacy
5. Administration lacks clear post-regime-change strategy (CNN report)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**STRONG EVIDENCE (large shifts):**
- Multiple independent sources confirm talks are actively occurring (Feb 17-18 Geneva talks) - DOWNWARD pressure on strike probability in immediate term
- Structural factor: CNN reports (Feb 16) US administration lacks post-regime-change plan - suggests hesitancy for major action
- Historical pattern: Metaculus community showed 26-day stability (48-51%) despite active news cycle - suggests strong anchoring

**MODERATE EVIDENCE (moderate shifts):**
- Single reliable source (CNN via anonymous officials) reports US exploring Israeli-led strikes rather than direct US action - DOWNWARD pressure on "US attack" probability
- Military buildup continues but no dramatic new deployments announced in past 5 days - NEUTRAL (already priced in)
- Iranian Foreign Minister's statement that missiles are "never negotiable" creates impasse - UPWARD pressure (talks may fail)
- Trump's pattern: threats followed by negotiations (per multiple sources) - DOWNWARD pressure (suggests bluffing strategy)

**WEAK EVIDENCE (small adjustments):**
- Prediction market activity mentioned in older articles (Jan 13) - outdated, speculative
- Expert opinions vary widely (some predict strikes, others emphasize risks) - conflicting signals
- Iranian military drills during talks (Hindustan Times) - routine posturing, not decisive

**Key insight from Israeli sources:** Reports suggest any strike would be Israeli-led with US support, not a direct US attack. This is CRITICAL for the underlying question "Will the United States attack Iran?" - supporting Israeli operations may not qualify as a US attack under resolution criteria.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 11 days (Feb 17 to Feb 28, 2026)
**Original question resolution:** April 1, 2026 (43 days from now)

**If timeframe were halved (5-6 days):**
Would increase confidence that prediction stays near 50% - Geneva talks on Feb 18 would dominate, providing immediate de-escalation signal. Very short window reduces probability of major news breaking. Prediction: 35% chance of exceeding 50%.

**If timeframe were doubled (22 days):**
Would decrease confidence in stability - more time for talks to collapse, new provocations, or Trump policy shifts. Longer window increases probability of volatility. However, also more time for mean reversion if prediction spikes. Prediction: 48% chance of exceeding 50%.

**Current 11-day window assessment:**
- Feb 18 talks are immediate catalyst (tomorrow)
- Sufficient time for talks outcome to be digested (10 days post-talks)
- Not enough time for major new military deployments to be announced and verified
- Enough time for one significant news event to move prediction 3-5 percentage points

## (d) Justification

**Starting point:** Outside view base rate of 43% (prediction will exceed 50.00%)

**Factors supporting DOWNWARD adjustment from base rate:**

1. **Geneva talks timing (STRONG):** Talks scheduled for tomorrow (Feb 18) provide immediate de-escalation signal. Historical pattern from agent report shows talks don't dramatically increase strike probability - the Jan 22-Feb 16 period included first round of talks with minimal community prediction movement. This suggests forecasters view active diplomacy as reducing immediate strike risk.

2. **Israeli-led strike scenario (MODERATE):** CNN and Israeli sources report potential strikes would be Israeli-led with US support, not direct US attacks. The resolution criteria specifically requires "the United States carries out a military attack" - supporting Israeli operations may not qualify. This is a structural factor that reduces the probability the underlying question resolves Yes, which should reduce the probability forecasters increase their estimates.

3. **Administration hesitancy signals (MODERATE):** CNN's Feb 16 report that administration lacks post-regime-change plan suggests decision-makers are not ready for major action. This is a structural constraint that forecasters would recognize.

**Factors supporting UPWARD adjustment from base rate:**

1. **Negotiation impasse (MODERATE):** Iranian FM's statement that missiles are "never negotiable" while Trump demands "no missiles" creates fundamental impasse. If talks collapse quickly, forecasters might increase strike probability. However, this is already known information, likely priced into current 50% prediction.

2. **Trump unpredictability (WEAK):** Multiple sources note Trump's erratic decision-making. However, his pattern has been threats followed by negotiations, not sudden strikes.

3. **Military buildup momentum (WEAK):** Ongoing deployments maintain strike option, but no dramatic new announcements in past 5 days to trigger prediction movement.

**Net assessment:**
The Geneva talks tomorrow represent the dominant near-term catalyst. The historical pattern shows talks reduce immediate strike probability in forecaster minds. The Israeli-led strike scenario is a structural factor that reduces the probability of the underlying question resolving Yes (which would reduce forecaster predictions). The 26-day stability pattern suggests strong anchoring around 50%.

The question requires the prediction to be HIGHER than 50.00% (strict inequality), meaning even 50.00% exactly counts as "No." This creates asymmetry - the prediction must move up, not just stay flat.

Given:
- Talks tomorrow likely provide modest downward pressure (2-3 percentage points)
- Strong anchoring around 50% for 26 days
- Need for strict upward movement (>50.00%)
- 11-day window with one major catalyst (talks) likely pushing down
- Structural factors (Israeli-led strikes, lack of post-regime plan) reducing underlying probability

**Adjustment:** The outside view base rate of 43% already accounts for general uncertainty and slight downward bias. The specific timing of Geneva talks tomorrow and the strict inequality requirement (>50.00%) justify maintaining or slightly reducing this estimate.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view: 43%

The Geneva talks tomorrow are a concrete near-term catalyst that historically reduces strike probability in forecaster assessments. The agent report shows the community moved down 4 percentage points (52% to 48%) on Jan 20-22 when Trump signaled "economic pressure first." Similar de-escalation signal from active talks should have comparable effect.

However, I must consider:
- Talks could collapse dramatically, triggering upward movement
- Trump could make new threats during/after talks
- 11 days provides some time for volatility

The strict inequality (>50.00% not ≥50.00%) means staying at exactly 50% counts as "No." This creates slight asymmetry against "Yes" outcome.

Balancing factors:
- Talks tomorrow: -5 percentage points
- Structural factors (Israeli-led, lack of plan): -3 percentage points  
- Potential for talks collapse/Trump threats: +3 percentage points
- Anchoring/stability bias: +2 percentage points (reduces extreme movements)

Net adjustment: -3 percentage points from base rate

**Final calibration: 40%**

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Metaculus community prediction for "US attacks Iran before April 2026" exceed 50.00% on Feb 28? Currently at exactly 50.00%, 11 days remain.

2. **Base rate:** Outside view established 43% based on reference class of Metaculus meta-questions with near-50% predictions and short timeframes. Final prediction of 40% is rooted to this base rate with modest adjustment for specific catalysts.

3. **Consistency check:** "40 out of 100 times, the Metaculus community prediction exceeds 50.00% on Feb 28." This aligns with my justification that Geneva talks tomorrow likely provide downward pressure, but some probability remains for talks collapse or Trump escalation.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence:**
   - Geneva talks scheduled Feb 18 (tomorrow) - historically reduces immediate strike probability in forecaster minds
   - 26-day stability at 48-51% despite active news cycle - strong anchoring effect
   - CNN report: potential strikes would be Israeli-led, not direct US attacks - reduces underlying question probability
   - Administration lacks post-regime-change plan (CNN) - suggests hesitancy for major action
   - Strict inequality requirement (>50.00%) creates asymmetry against "Yes"

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Geneva talks collapse spectacularly on Feb 18 with Trump immediately issuing explicit strike threats and announcing third carrier deployment. This would likely push prediction to 55-60%, making my forecast look too conservative. Probability of this scenario: ~15%, which is already factored into my 40% estimate.

6. **Status quo outcome:** Status quo is prediction staying at or near 50%. Given 26-day stability and talks tomorrow, modest downward drift to 48-49% seems most likely. This supports my 40% prediction (60% chance it stays at/below 50%).

Probability: 40%
