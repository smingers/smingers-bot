Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources:**
1. **Times of Israel (14 Feb 2026)**: Reports U.S. military preparing for weeks-long operations against Iran. Uses anonymous U.S. officials but includes named Pentagon announcements. High reliability for military deployment facts; speculation about planning is less certain. 3 days old.

2. **CNBC (14 Feb 2026)**: Corroborates Times of Israel reporting with same Reuters sources. Medium-high reliability. 3 days old.

3. **Al Jazeera (12 Feb 2026)**: Reports second carrier deployment and diplomatic context. Reliable for factual military movements. 5 days old.

4. **CNN (3 Feb 2026)**: Reports Iran's conditional agreement to nuclear talks. High reliability for diplomatic developments. 14 days old, now superseded by actual talks occurring.

5. **DW (12 Jan 2026)**: Reports on Iran protests and Trump's threats. Reliable for death toll estimates from named NGO (Iran Human Rights). 36 days old.

6. **AskNews articles (14-17 Feb 2026)**: Multiple international sources (CNN Español, Interfax, Sina News, etc.) reporting:
   - U.S. lacks clear post-regime plan (CNN via Interfax, 17 Feb)
   - Second round of Geneva talks occurred 17 Feb (multiple sources)
   - Netanyahu setting conditions for any deal (Phoenix News, 16 Feb)
   - Israeli media suggesting Israel, not U.S., would strike Iran's missile sites (Sözcü, Haberler, 16 Feb)
   - Over 250 military cargo flights to Middle East (CNN Español, 16 Feb)

**Key Factual Information (not opinions):**
- Geneva talks occurred 17 Feb 2026 (today)
- Two U.S. carrier groups deployed/deploying to region
- Over 250 cargo flights documented
- Iran conducted missile drills near disputed islands
- Previous "Midnight Hammer" operation occurred June 2025

**Expert Opinions (identifiable sources):**
- Vali Nasr (Johns Hopkins): Regime in "end chapter" (ABC, 13 Feb)
- Multiple U.S. officials (anonymous): Window for intervention may have closed
- Israeli intelligence assessments: Trump may attack to force negotiations

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Status quo maintenance**: Multiple independent sources confirm talks are ongoing (Geneva, 17 Feb). This is a concrete diplomatic process that reduces immediate strike probability. When negotiations are active, Metaculus crowds typically reduce attack probabilities.
- **No attack has occurred yet**: Despite weeks of military buildup and threats, no strike has happened. Each day without action slightly reduces the perceived immediacy.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Military buildup is real but not novel**: Deployment of carriers and aircraft has been ongoing for weeks. This information was likely already priced into the 50% prediction. The buildup maintains tension but doesn't represent new escalation.
- **Leaked Israeli strategy**: Multiple Turkish sources (Sözcü, Haberler, 16 Feb) report that any attack would be Israeli-led, not U.S.-led. If true, this technically means "U.S. attacks Iran" becomes less likely even if conflict occurs.
- **Time remaining until April 2026**: 42 days remain in the target question's window. More time = more uncertainty = predictions tend to regress toward 50%.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Trump's rhetoric**: Threats are consistent but not new. Trump has been threatening Iran for weeks without action.
- **Prediction market speculation**: Polymarket showing 54% on 13 Jan is interesting but reflects betting sentiment, not new facts.
- **Prophecy/astrology articles**: Zero evidential value.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Current timeframe**: 11 days until 28 Feb 2026 11:51 UTC.

The target question asks about U.S. attacks before April 2026 (42 days away). The meta-question asks about the community prediction on a specific date.

**If timeframe were halved (5.5 days)**: Less time for news to move the prediction significantly. Would favor status quo (staying near 50%).

**If timeframe were doubled (22 days)**: More time for major developments (breakthrough or collapse of talks, actual military action, regime change in Iran). Higher volatility, but directionality still uncertain. Might slightly favor movement away from 50% in either direction.

**Key consideration**: The Geneva talks just occurred today (17 Feb). Results/reactions will emerge over next 2-3 days. This is the most likely catalyst for movement in the community prediction.

## (d) Justification

**Starting point**: Outside view base rate of 47% (accounting for 50.00% exact landing).

**Factors favoring increase toward "Yes" (CP > 50%):**
1. **Talks may fail**: If Geneva talks collapse or show no progress, the Metaculus crowd will likely increase attack probability, pushing CP above 50%.
2. **Continued military buildup**: Ongoing deployments maintain tension and could be interpreted as preparation for imminent action.

**Factors favoring decrease toward "No" (CP ≤ 50%):**
1. **Talks are happening**: Active diplomacy typically reduces immediate conflict probability in forecaster minds. The fact that talks occurred today suggests both sides see value in negotiation.
2. **No attack yet**: Despite weeks of threats and buildup, no strike has occurred. Each passing day without action slightly reduces perceived likelihood.
3. **Israeli-led scenario**: If the emerging narrative is that Israel (not U.S.) would conduct strikes, this technically makes the target question less likely to resolve "Yes."
4. **U.S. lacks post-regime plan**: CNN reporting (via Interfax, 17 Feb) that U.S. has no clear plan for post-regime Iran suggests hesitation about full-scale intervention.

**Net assessment**: The Geneva talks occurring today is the most significant recent development. While we don't yet know the outcome, the mere fact of continued diplomacy slightly reduces the probability that forecasters will increase their attack estimates over the next 11 days. However, the effect is modest because:
- Talks could still fail
- Military pressure remains high
- The crowd is already at 50% (maximum uncertainty)

The outside view suggests near-50% with slight downward bias due to tie-breaking. Current circumstances don't dramatically change this. The most likely scenario is that the CP remains very close to 50%, with slight movement based on talk outcomes.

**Adjustment**: Small downward shift from 47% to 45% based on active diplomacy reducing immediate attack perception, but maintaining high uncertainty given volatile situation.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view base rate of 47%, I consider:

**Current trend**: The community prediction has been stable around 50% for several days. Without a major catalyst, inertia favors staying near 50%.

**True probability consideration**: This is a meta-question about crowd behavior, not about whether an attack will actually occur. The crowd tends to be slow to update and sticky around round numbers like 50%. Given:
- Active talks (slight dovish signal)
- No attack yet (slight dovish signal)
- Continued military presence (slight hawkish signal)
- High uncertainty (favors staying near 50%)

The probability that the CP moves above 50.00% in the next 11 days is slightly below 50%.

**Confidence check**: At 45%, I'm saying that in 45 out of 100 similar situations, the CP would be above 50% on 28 Feb. This feels appropriate given the balanced but slightly dovish recent developments.

**+-10% sensitivity**: 
- At 35%: Would imply strong confidence that talks will succeed and crowd will become more dovish. Not justified by evidence.
- At 55%: Would imply talks will likely fail and crowd will become more hawkish. Also not justified by current evidence.

45% feels calibrated to the genuine uncertainty while accounting for the slight dovish tilt from active diplomacy.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Metaculus community prediction for "US attacks Iran before April 2026" exceed 50.00% on 28 Feb 2026? (11 days from now)

2. **Base rate**: Outside view established 47% based on reference class of geopolitical questions at 50% with 11 days to observation.

3. **Consistency**: "45 out of 100 times, the Metaculus community prediction is above 50.00% on 28 February 2026." This aligns with my justification that current circumstances are near-balanced with slight dovish tilt.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Geneva talks occurred today (17 Feb), indicating active diplomacy
   - No U.S. attack has occurred despite weeks of buildup
   - Multiple sources report Israeli-led strike scenario, not U.S.-led
   - Community prediction has been stable around 50% recently
   - U.S. reportedly lacks clear post-regime plan

5. **Blind spot**: Geneva talks produce unexpected breakthrough or complete collapse in next 2-3 days, causing sharp movement in CP. A breakthrough could push CP to 40-45% (making "No" more likely). A collapse could push CP to 55-60% (making "Yes" more likely). Either scenario ~30% probable, which I've partially accounted for.

6. **Status quo**: CP staying at exactly 50.00% or very close (49-51%) is the most likely outcome given historical volatility and current uncertainty. This favors "No" due to tie-breaking rule.

Probability: 45%
