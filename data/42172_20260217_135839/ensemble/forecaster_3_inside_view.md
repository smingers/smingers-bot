Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / resolution criteria (meta-question)
This resolves **Yes** if the Metaculus **community prediction** for “Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?” is **> 50.00%** at **2026-02-28 11:51:38**; otherwise **No**. If the target question resolves before then, this resolves to the same outcome.

2) (a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; what’s fact vs opinion)
- Times of Israel (Feb 14, 2026; Reuters-sourced): Reports (via 2 anonymous US officials) US military planning for potentially weeks-long operations; additional carrier and assets. High relevance; primary factual claims are the deployments/planning leaks. Some interpretive language (“far more serious conflict”) is opinion.
- CNBC (Feb 14, 2026; Reuters relay): Same Reuters reporting. High quality, redundant confirmation. Facts: preparations, additional carrier, expected retaliation. Opinions: “more serious than previously seen” framing.
- Al Jazeera (Feb 12, 2026): Second carrier (USS Ford) movement; ties to Trump statements about quick deal and threats if talks fail. Medium-high quality; some framing, but key facts (carrier movements, quotes) are checkable.
- CNN (Feb 3, 2026): Iran conditionally agrees to talks in Oman; US keeps strike option open; mentions Iran rebuilding deeper, barred inspections. High quality; mix of facts and official positions. Some claims about nuclear status rely on IAEA reporting (credible).
- DW live blog (Jan 12, 2026): Protest death/arrest estimates from Iran Human Rights; US strike option “on the table.” Medium quality for fast-moving items; NGO casualty figures plausible but uncertain. Still relevant as context.
- AskNews / KRDO / CNN Español (Feb 16, 2026; appears to be CNN reporting syndicated): Detailed military logistics buildup (cargo flights, aircraft in Jordan, two carrier groups), plus reporting that US lacks clarity on post-regime scenarios. High quality if indeed CNN-sourced; facts about deployments are strong, inside-baseball assessments partly anonymous.
- AskNews Interfax.ru (Feb 17, 2026): Russian outlet summarizing similar CNN-like points + noting Geneva round on Feb 17. Medium: could be accurate but second-hand and in Russian media ecosystem; treat as corroborative only.
- AskNews Sözcü/Haberler (Feb 16, 2026): Claims “leaked scenario” where Israel strikes and US supports logistically. Medium-low: plausible but less reliable; anonymous “US media reports” style; useful mainly as a hypothesis for “US might not directly attack.”
- Other AskNews items (Sina/Sohu, RIA, prophecy articles): Lower reliability / heavy narrative; I treat as weak signals only.

3) (b) Evidence analysis using the weighing system
Strong evidence (pushes toward CP drifting above 50):
- Multiple independent, high-quality outlets (Reuters via ToI/CNBC; CNN-syndicated pieces) report **significant US force posture changes** (second carrier, aircraft redeployments, heavy cargo flights) and **planning** for sustained operations. This is precisely the kind of “catalytic” information that moves crowd forecasts. (Strong)

Moderate evidence (mixed direction, but increases volatility around 50):
- **Active negotiations** (Oman/Geneva rounds) + repeated “prefer diplomacy but all options on table” messaging: tends to cap extreme probabilities and can pull forecasts down if talks show progress. (Moderate, downward pressure)
- Reporting that the administration **lacks a clear post-regime plan** and sees IRGC filling vacuum: implies restraint / higher perceived cost of escalation, slightly downward for “attack” probability, but also supports the idea that if strikes happen they’re punitive rather than regime-change (ambiguous). (Moderate, slightly downward on “attack”)

Weak evidence (small adjustments only):
- Claims that the US would only support an Israeli strike (Sözcü/Haberler): could reduce “US attacks Iran” probability if true, but source quality and ambiguity (support could still include US kinetic actions later) keep weight low. (Weak, downward)
- Oil price “softness” framing: markets not screaming “imminent strike,” but oil is confounded by OPEC+/demand. (Weak, downward)

4) (c) Timeframe analysis
- Time until the meta-outcome is observed: **11 days** (Feb 17 → Feb 28).
- If timeframe were halved (~5–6 days): less time for forecasters to react + less chance of an actual strike before Feb 28; I’d expect probability of “>50” to move closer to a coin flip but slightly lower (less time for drift above 50).
- If timeframe were doubled (~22 days): more time for either (i) talks to fail and risk premium to rise or (ii) talks to succeed and probability to drop; overall I’d expect *more* movement away from exactly 50, but direction would depend strongly on negotiation headlines.

5) (d) Justification: adjusting the outside view to an inside view
Outside view base rate (given): **46%** for CP ending up **>50.00** by Feb 28, based on recent inertia near 50 and “time decay/diplomacy” mild downward pull.

What’s changed / why inside view differs:
- The last few days feature a **cluster of high-salience, mainstream reports** about **weeks-long campaign planning** plus **visible force buildup** (two carrier strike groups, many cargo flights, fighter deployments). Even if some of this is “coercive diplomacy,” Metaculus participants often respond to these cues by nudging probabilities upward—especially when the current CP is exactly 50.00 and only needs a tiny move to clear the threshold.
- Status quo if nothing changes: the CP has been sticky around ~50, but the **new reporting increases the odds that marginal updaters push it to 50.1–52** rather than 48–49.9.
- Counterweight: ongoing talks and some reporting about the US not wanting to own a regime-collapse scenario are real restraints, limiting a large rise (i.e., I do not expect a jump to 65+ absent a clear trigger).

Net: I move modestly upward from 46%, mainly because (1) multiple top-tier sources validate “strike-capable posture + planning,” and (2) the meta-threshold is razor-thin (>50.00), so small sentiment changes matter.

Probability calibration
- I decompose mentally into two pathways:
  1) Target question resolves (US attacks Iran) before Feb 28 → then this meta-question resolves Yes automatically.
  2) No resolution by Feb 28 → depends on whether the community median is slightly above or at/below 50.

Given current tension and deployments, I assign a non-trivial but still minority chance of a qualifying US kinetic strike before Feb 28; plus, even without a strike, the “planning + buildup” newsflow makes “slightly above 50” marginally more likely than “slightly below.”

Inside-view update from outside-view 46%: +7 points (strong mainstream buildup/planning coverage overcoming mild time-decay/diplomacy pull).

Checklist:
1) Criteria: CP on 2026-02-28 11:51:38 for target question must be >50.00% (or target resolves earlier and carries through).
2) Outside view base rate: 46%.
3) Consistency check: 53 out of 100 times, the CP is >50.00% at the snapshot (or resolves Yes earlier).
4) Key evidence:
   - Reuters/CNN: expanded deployments + weeks-long ops planning (high-salience, multi-source).
   - Negotiations ongoing (caps upside; prevents big spike).
   - CP currently exactly 50.00 (tiny move flips outcome).
   - Some “US supports Israel rather than strike” narratives (low-confidence downward).
5) Blind spot: a credible, public diplomatic breakthrough (or de-escalatory US announcement) could pull CP to 45–49 quickly.
6) Status quo: recent stickiness near 50 argues against large moves; my forecast is only slightly >50.

Probability: 53%
