Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first, ≤2 lines factual summary + quality note each)

1. Interfax (17 Feb 26) – cites “multiple US officials” saying the White House has no clear plan if Iran’s regime collapses; confirms Geneva talks resume 18 Feb.  Reputable wire, timely, largely factual.  
2. Sina News (17 Feb 26) – Chinese defence blog listing detailed US aircraft deployments, quotes Iranian FM; mixes fact with Beijing-leaning commentary.  Medium quality, still useful for ORBAT data.  
3. CNN Español / KRDO mirror (16 Feb 26) – CNN reporting on extra carrier, 250 cargo flights, F-15s in Jordan; quotes Rubio & Trump.  High quality, on-record officials + OSINT.  
4. Reuters via CNBC (14 Feb 26) – two named and two anonymous US officials on Pentagon planning for weeks-long campaign; clear sourcing, strong reputation.  
5. Al-Jazeera (12 Feb 26) – carrier redeployment, recap of Oman talks; good factual track-record, occasional editorial framing.  
Metaculus datapoint – platform shows CP=50.00 % on 16 Feb, historically oscillating 48–51 % for weeks.  First-hand numerical data; very high reliability.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to “CP will be > 50 % on 28 Feb”)

Strong evidence (pushes slightly up)  
• Multiple independent wires (Reuters, CNN, AJ) confirm tangible US force build-up and officials preparing strike options – raises perceived attack risk.  
• No breakthrough after first Oman round; second round 18 Feb but positions still far apart – sustains perceived risk.

Moderate evidence (mixed)  
• High-level diplomacy still active; Trump repeatedly says he “prefers a deal” – tempers escalation narrative.  
• CP has been in a tight 3-point band for >6 weeks – shows structural stickiness around 50.

Weak evidence  
• Opinion pieces predicting China/Russia intervention or biblical prophecies – discounted.  
• Betting-market chatter about precise strike dates already passed – stale.

Net weight: The credible military-posture news slightly increases upside volatility but does not outweigh the documented inertia of the community forecast.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Duration to measurement: 11 days.  CP one-week σ historically ≈1–1.5 pp for similar questions.  Halving timeframe (5 d) would further favour “No” due to even less time for drift; doubling (22 d) would raise chance of a >50 reading by ~5 pp because more headlines can accumulate.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (knife-edge CP): 48.8 % for “> 50”.  
Adjust up +2 pp: credible, widely reported US preparations make an upside jump (>51 %) a bit likelier than a downside jump (<49 %).  
Adjust down –1 pp: 25–30 % chance the CP sits exactly at 50.00 % (historic focal-point stickiness) resolves to “No”.  
Adjusted estimate: 49.8 % ⇒ round to 50 ? Re-check consistency: need slight lean to “No” because equality counts against “Yes”.  Final: 48 %.

Probability calibration:

I expect that in 48 out of 100 comparable 11-day windows, the Metaculus community prediction would end up strictly above 50.00 %; in 52 it would be 50.00 % or lower.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “Will Metaculus community median for US strike on Iran exceed 50 % at 11:51 UTC on 28 Feb 2026?”  
2. Base rate stated 48.8 %.  
3. Consistency line above.  
4. Key evidence: (i) US carrier/fighter build-up (multi-source), (ii) Geneva talks scheduled 18 Feb with hard gaps, (iii) CP has hovered 48–51 % for >6 w, (iv) equality resolves “No”.  
5. Blind-spot: a dramatic strike order or collapse of talks within the next week could spike CP to ~60 %, making “Yes” clearly correct.  
6. Status-quo bias acknowledged; timeframe short, volatility low → slight tilt to “No”.

Probability: 48%
