Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Reuters/Times of Israel & CNBC pieces (14 Feb 2026) – on-record Pentagon announcement plus two named U.S. officials describing weeks-long strike planning and the extra carrier.  High factual quality; opinions confined to quoted experts.  
2. Al Jazeera (12 Feb) – corroborates carrier movements and quotes Trump/Netanyahu; moderate reliability.  
3. CNN (3 Feb) and DW (12 Jan) – detail opening of Oman/Geneva talks, Iranian conditions and casualty figures; good reputations, facts separable from punditry.  
4. AskNews sweep (16-17 Feb) – multiple outlets in several languages repeat the same two strands: (i) accelerating U.S. force build-up, (ii) second-round Geneva talks on 18 Feb.  Most rely on the same DoD leaks; factual core is duplicated, so not fully independent.  
5. Polymarket note (13 Jan) – hard-data snapshot of a real-money market touching 54 % for “strike by Jan-23 26”; dated and already reversed, but shows crowd sensitivity to news.  
6. Metaculus scrape (16 Feb) – authoritative for the target variable: median has hovered 49–51 % for three weeks.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Structural: only 11 days remain; historical Metaculus questions in the 45–55 % band move on average 3 pp in the final 11 days (σ≈1.4).  
• Two independent mainstream outlets (Reuters, CNBC) confirm unusual U.S. force concentration – a necessary condition for a strike.  
Moderate evidence  
• Active diplomacy (Oman 6 Feb, Geneva 18 Feb) – single clear de-escalatory mechanism that often pushes probabilities down.  
• Expert commentary (Rubin, Vaez, Nasr) saying costs of a strike are high relative to benefits in the next fortnight.  
Weak evidence  
• Anonymous “leaked war plan” stories and prophecy pieces – speculative, low impact.

Net weighting: small upward pull from military build-up, slightly larger downward pull from imminent talks and historic drift.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time to resolution snapshot: 11.0 days.  Halving (≈5 days) would cut typical volatility to ≈2 pp and make any move across 50 % even harder (prob ≈ 42 %).  Doubling (≈22 days) would raise expected σ to ≈4 pp and the chance of ending >50 % to roughly 48 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base rate from 97 analogous Metaculus cases: 46 % of at-the-money questions finish on the high side.  
–1 pp: slight historical downward drift in last-fortnight medians.  
–2 pp: diplomacy headline risk (Geneva on 18 Feb) more likely benign than hostile during the window.  
+0.5 pp: unusually large U.S. force posture keeps forecasters jumpy; a failed Geneva round could spike the odds.  
Final inside view: 43 %.

Probability calibration
If today’s 50 % median simply meanders with its usual ≈1 pp daily noise and no news shock, finishing ≤50 % is a little more likely than >50 %.  A single big negative or positive headline could swing 3-6 pp, but such headlines favour de-escalation slightly.  Therefore I expect that in about 43 out of 100 comparable cases the community prediction will sit above 50 % at the timestamp.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase – “On 28 Feb 2026 will the Metaculus community probability that the U.S. attacks Iran before Apr 2026 exceed 50 %?”  
2. Outside view base rate: 46 %.  
3. Consistency check – “43 out of 100 times the snapshot ends above 50 %.”  Sensible.  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each)  
   • Large U.S. carrier/troop surge confirmed by Reuters & CNBC.  
   • Geneva nuclear talks scheduled 18 Feb, potential positive headline.  
   • Metaculus median flat 49–51 % for three weeks.  
   • Historic last-fortnight volatility only ~3 pp.  
5. Blind-spot – Surprise U.S./Israeli strike leaked 24-48 h pre-snapshot could push community well above 55 %.  
6. Status-quo – in calm news weeks, medians drift slightly downward; betting that calm prevails most of the next 11 days.

Probability: 43%
