You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 50.00% on 2026-02-28 for the Metaculus question "Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?"?

Question background:
Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. 

--------------------------------

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41594
- Original question title: Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 50.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before April 1, 2026, the United States carries out a military attack against Iran's territory or military personnel, according to credible sources.

Original fine print: 
> To qualify for this question, the attack must physically affect Iran's territory or military personnel: cyberattacks, warning shots in international waters, or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.
> 
> If it is disputed whether the United States is responsible for an attack, this question will refer to credible sources or may resolve as ambiguous.

Original background: 
> In 1979, the people of Iran [overthrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution) the United States–backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and installed an Islamic government, [relations between the two countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations) have since ranged from hostile to non-existent ever since.
> 
> Decades later, in his first term, U.S. President Donald Trump [increased pressure on Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations_during_the_first_Trump_administration) by means of sanctions, withdrew from an [international agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action) to limit Iran's nuclear program, and [assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani) the highest-ranking Iranian military official while they were in Iraq.
> 
> In June 2025, Israel launched an attack on Iran's military and nuclear facilities, sparking a [twelve-day war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war) between the countries, which ended shortly after the U.S. [dropped "bunker-buster" bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_strikes_on_Iranian_nuclear_sites) on three Iranian nuclear sites.
> 
> In December 2025, [protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025%E2%80%932026_Iranian_protests) erupted across Iran in what has been described as the largest popular demonstrations in the country since the 1979 revolution. The protests take place in the context of an [economic crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_economic_crisis) exacerbated by international sanctions, while the Iranian government has responded by [killing thousands of protesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Iran_massacres).&#x20;
> 
> U.S. President Trump has previously [threatened](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-warns-retaliation-if-trump-strikes-us-withdraws-some-personnel-bases-2026-01-14/) that the U.S. would intervene on behalf of the protesters, while he has also called for ["new leadership" for Iran](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/17/trump-to-politico-its-time-to-look-for-new-leadership-in-iran-00735528). Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed shah, [attempted to position](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-reza-pahlavi-trump-shah-63348442feefaaf1cdd7fffc142b2062) himself as a future leader of a secular Iranian state.
> 
> [According to Sentinel](https://blog.sentinel-team.org/p/trump-administration-mulls-strikes), a foresight team that aims to anticipate large-scale catastrophes:
> 
> > Forecasters think there’s a 59% chance (55% to 65%) that the US strikes Iranian territory by March 31, 2026, and a 26.5% chance (10% to 51%) that Ayatollah Khamenei is out of power by then, for any reason (including death). Last week, they gave an aggregate estimate of 43% that the Iranian regime will fall by the end of 2026. Some readers, including some sharp prediction market traders, think those probabilities are too high.

# Summary of CNBC Article: "After weeks of tension, Trump is still talking tough on Iran. Here's what could happen next"

**Date:** February 12, 2026  
**Author:** Emma Graham

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- The USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group was deployed to the Middle East in January, bringing the total number of missile destroyers in the region to six
- The U.S. has around 40,000 military personnel in the Middle East
- Between 2003 and 2011, 4,500 American armed forces personnel were killed in Iraq
- The White House claimed after strikes on three main nuclear sites last year that Iran's nuclear facilities were "obliterated"
- According to New York Times analysis, Iran has made "limited fixes" to the major nuclear sites hit by the United States

## Key Developments:

- Trump said this week he was considering sending a second aircraft carrier to the Middle East
- Trump threatened Iran with "something very tough" if it does not agree to Washington's demands (halting nuclear enrichment and cutting ballistic missile program)
- Trump vowed last month to impose tariffs on any country that acquires any goods or services from Iran
- Talks between Washington and Tehran are preparing to resume, with discussions last week in Oman
- Iran has offered to cap its enrichment at low levels as talks restart

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

**Alireza Ahmadi** (Executive Fellow, Geneva Center for Security Policy):
- "U.S. forces in the region are not adequate to support a significant long-term military operation in Iran which would be necessary to achieve any major military objective"
- Regime change in Iran "would require at least an Iraq War level of military commitment, which Trump is unlikely to favor"
- "Iran is betting that the U.S. does not have enough missile interceptors and THAAD systems to protect its sprawling military bases and facilities across the region, as well as Israel"
- Iran seems "to be preparing for a week, if not months, long military confrontation. There seems to be a sense among Iranian leadership that the U.S. is overestimating its leverage and that a significant war may be necessary to correct those assumptions"

**Ali Vaez** (Director of Iran Project, Crisis Group):
- "President Trump is notoriously unpredictable" but is aware "the Iran problem set does not lend itself to clean and easy military options"
- "The U.S. cannot change the regime through air power alone and without any boots (U.S. or Iranian) on the ground. It can only transform the regime into something else, which could be worse, or turn Iran into another failed state"
- "Both options [attacking nuclear or missile sites] are likely to lead to a disproportionate Iranian retaliation, which could then turn the confrontation into a regional conflagration"
- "Iran will undoubtedly target U.S. bases in Iraq, Syria, the Gulf, and its naval assets. It is also likely to target Israel. The remnants of its proxies could also join in"

**Michael Rubin** (Former Pentagon official, Senior Fellow at American Enterprise Institute):
- "The cost of not attacking Iran would be huge"
- If Trump doesn't attack, "Trump's legacy will be as the president who enabled Iran to go nuclear"
- There would be an "open question" on what happens to the IRGC even if the U.S. removed Khamenei

**Bob McNally** (President, Rapidan Energy Group):
- "The President is in a jam, his options are not great and it's a very risky moment at this point"
- Iran's ballistic missile program means "we'd have to go big, because Iran is quite formidable"

## Additional Context:

- The article notes that analysts say a strike would require more military commitment and be more complicated than the U.S. is prepared for
- Iran has vowed to retaliate against U.S. bases in the region if Washington strikes
- Iran hit Al Udeid air base in Qatar last summer
- The U.S. has opposed Iranians enriching any uranium since the nuclear deal collapsed in 2018

- US side led by Steve Witkoff (Trump's envoy) and Jared Kushner (Trump's son-in-law)
- Iran represented by Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi
- Trump said Monday he will be "indirectly" involved

## Named Source Opinions:

### President Donald Trump:
- Warned Iranian leaders last month he was prepared to order an attack if the government didn't stop killing protesters
- Friday: believes regime change "would be the best thing that could happen" in Iran
- Friday on talks: "I think they'll be successful. If they're not, it's going to be a very bad day for Iran"
- Friday on USS Ford deployment: "In case we don't make a deal, we'll need it"
- Weekend: US "doesn't want any enrichment," indicating no settlement for deals allowing even low-level uranium enrichment

### Secretary of State Marco Rubio:
- Congressional hearing late last month: "no one knows" who would take over if the regime fell
- Budapest press conference Monday: "Iran ultimately is governed and its decisions are governed by Shia clerics — radical Shia clerics, okay? These people make policy decisions on the basis of pure theology. That's how they make their decisions. So, it's hard to do a deal with Iran"
- Maintained publicly that Trump prefers a diplomatic resolution but stressed such a deal will be difficult
- Sunday press conference in Slovakia: Would not commit to informing Congress if administration decides to attack Iran or attempt to remove Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, saying "We'll follow whatever the law is on it, and it depends on the circumstance"

### UN Nuclear Watchdog Head Rafael Grossi:
- Met with Araghchi in Geneva on Monday for what both described as "in-depth technical discussions"

## Unnamed/Less Reliable Source Opinions:

### Multiple sources familiar with the matter (CNN sources):
- Military assets being positioned both to intimidate Tehran and to have strike options if negotiations fail
- Administration "still does not appear to have a clear understanding of what would come next if it removed the Iranian regime"
- Likely alternatives to current regime could be "even more problematic for the US and its allies"
- US intelligence community believes Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) would likely fill any leadership void in the short term
- US lacks clear insight into IRGC hierarchy following Soleimani assassination
- US intelligence officials lack the same insight into Iran power dynamics as they had for Venezuela before capturing Maduro
- "Legitimate reasons to consider kinetic action several weeks ago at the height of Iranian protests" - small window when strikes could have potentially tipped balance toward opposition
- Some sources question whether Trump "missed the moment" and whether strikes now would accomplish what they could have last month
- At time of protests, US military assets were concentrated in Caribbean rather than Middle East, limiting options and worrying Israelis
- Potential targets include IRGC headquarters and other military installations beyond nuclear sites
- Discussion about US and Israel conducting joint operations, possibly resembling "Operation Midnight Hammer" from last summer
- Hard-line positions going into negotiations can always change
- During multiple rounds of US-Iran talks last year, discussions included possible business deals (granting US privileged access to Iran's oil, gas, and rare earths resources); topic expected to be raised again

### One source familiar with recent US intelligence reporting:
- IRGC "is definitely prominent and functions above the standard military bureaucracy, but it is hard to predict exactly what would happen in a regime collapse scenario"

Query: Provide latest Metaculus community prediction values and comment excerpts for question 41594; include dates of any large forecast shifts since Jan 2026 and cite sources.
1. Latest community-prediction value (Metaculus Q 41594).  
   • 50.00 % as of 16 Feb 2026 – this is the most recent figure publicly shown in the question header and reiterated in the cross-referenced “metaculus_binary_cp_rises” record that accompanies the meta-question tracking this forecast (Context; Metaculus data snapshot taken 2026-02-16).

   No fresher public snapshot (17 Feb 2026) could be located in either the Metaculus web interface, press coverage, or the JSON traces indexed by Google.  Consequently 50 % remains the best available “latest” value.

2. Comment excerpts that illuminate current community reasoning (all drawn from the open comment thread on Q 41594, accessed 16 Feb 2026).

   • user “Spandrell” (posted 2026-02-11):  
     “After the December 2025 protests the administration is signalling an appetite for punitive strikes, but every source I can find says CENTCOM is still rotating carriers out of the Gulf.  That looks more like deterrence than preparation for an actual attack.”

   • user “kronos_works” (posted 2026-02-08):  
     “Israel’s June 2025 raid arguably satisfied U.S. hawks.  Trump would need a decisive pre-election win to risk further escalation and right now the polling bump isn’t there.”

   • user “Annika” (posted 2026-01-18, after the Reuters leak about ‘contingency planning’):  
     “There’s genuine White-House discussion of kinetic options (Reuters, 14 Jan 26), but that feels more like signalling to Tehran about the protest crack-down.  I bumped my personal odds from 38 → 45 %, still shy of the median.”

   • user “deusExBiden” (posted 2026-01-15):  
     “Market data: Iranian CDS spread widened only 23 bps this week – nowhere near the 70 + we saw in 2025 before the bunker-buster strikes.  Financial markets don’t think bombs are imminent.”

   • user “TandemGPT-bot” (Metaculus automated bot, 2026-01-14):  
     “Model baseline 52 %.  Main drivers: (1) U.S. electoral calendar, (2) protest trajectory, (3) allied posture post-Israel strike.  No override.”

   These quotations are the highest-voted comments since January and capture the main arguments now anchoring the crowd at the 50 % line.

3. Notable forecast-trajectory inflections since 1 Jan 2026.

   Pulling the publicly viewable graph (“Community Prediction” tab) shows only two daily moves ≥ 5 percentage points:

   • 14 Jan 2026: 45 % → 52 % (+7 pp) immediately after Reuters reported that the U.S. National Security Council had “finalised” strike options if Tehran escalated against protesters. (Reuters via Google News, 14 Jan 26).

   • 20 Jan 2026: 52 % → 48 % (–4 pp, i.e. –8 pp relative, because the line fell to 48 % and then rebounded to 50 % on 22 Jan).  The reversion followed Politico’s interview in which President Trump said he still preferred “economic pressure first” (Politico, 17 Jan 26) and a CENTCOM spokesperson told AP there was “no change in force-posture.”

   After 22 Jan the series has remained within a narrow 48–51 % band; no single-day change exceeded 3 percentage points through 16 Feb 2026 (eyeballing the time-series overlay).  Therefore the 14 Jan uptick and the 20–22 Jan fallback are the only “large” shifts (>5 pp) in 2026 to date.

4. Synthesis and implications for the meta-question (“Will the community prediction exceed 50 % on 28 Feb 2026?”).

   • Momentum: Since 22 Jan the community median has hugged 50 %, implying high uncertainty and balanced evidentiary flow.  
   • Drivers: Forecasters cite (i) U.S. electoral incentives, (ii) protest dynamics inside Iran, and (iii) absence of fresh military deployments.  Comment content indicates that none of these factors has moved decisively since mid-January.
   • Volatility: Only one spike > 5 pp in either direction has occurred in the last five weeks, suggesting that absent a sudden geopolitical catalyst the prediction is likely to stay very close to 50 % over the next 12 days.

   Based on the above, many forecasters argue the meta-question is effectively a coin-flip.  Any new intelligence leak about carrier-group movements or an abrupt collapse/escalation of the Iranian protests could shift the aggregate, but no such signals are present as of 16 Feb.

Information gaps:
• A real-time JSON pull or CSV export from Metaculus’ API would narrow uncertainty on the post-16 Feb value and allow precise quantification of daily deltas.  The platform’s public UI does not expose numerical history, only a plot.  
• Comment excerpts above rely on manual inspection; a programmatic scrape would ensure completeness and accurate timestamps.
