Analysis:
In the 11 days between now (2026-02-17) and the cut-off (2026-02-28), the Metaculus community prediction will move almost entirely in response to fresh signals about the probability that the U.S. will actually strike Iran before 1 April 2026. Therefore the most decision-relevant information is:  
• Any concrete military preparations (carrier group movements, Air Force redeployments, orders to CENTCOM).  
• Authoritative leaks or public statements from President Trump, senior Pentagon officials, or Congress hinting at imminent action.  
• Escalatory events in the region (Iranian crackdown on protests, attacks on U.S. forces or shipping, Israeli requests for U.S. support).  
• Diplomatic developments that lower the chance of war (back-channel talks, cease-fire proposals, new sanctions instead of force).  
Locating very recent (February 2026) reporting on these points will help gauge whether forecasters are likely to push the community prediction above or below 50 %.
