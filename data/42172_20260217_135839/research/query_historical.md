Analysis:
To anticipate whether the Metaculus community forecast will tick above 50 % by 28 Feb 2026, I need (a) the past trajectory of that forecast and any inflection points, (b) very recent geopolitical developments that could plausibly move the crowd’s probability in the next eleven days (e.g., new U.S. statements, troop deployments, Iranian actions), and (c) any Metaculus-specific discussion or outside commentary (e.g., Sentinel notes) that might sway forecasters. Therefore I will look for (1) historical snapshots or plots of the Metaculus question, (2) breaking or near-term news about U.S.–Iran military moves in February 2026, and (3) detailed community commentary or expert analysis referencing the Metaculus question ID 41594. Economic data are not directly relevant.
