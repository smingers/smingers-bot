Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41594
- Original question title: Will the United States attack Iran before April 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 50.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as **Yes** if, before April 1, 2026, the United States carries out a military attack against Iran's territory or military personnel, according to credible sources.

Original fine print: 
> To qualify for this question, the attack must physically affect Iran's territory or military personnel: cyberattacks, warning shots in international waters, or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.
> 
> If it is disputed whether the United States is responsible for an attack, this question will refer to credible sources or may resolve as ambiguous.

Original background: 
> In 1979, the people of Iran [overthrew](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_Revolution) the United States–backed Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi and installed an Islamic government, [relations between the two countries](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations) have since ranged from hostile to non-existent ever since.
> 
> Decades later, in his first term, U.S. President Donald Trump [increased pressure on Iran](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93United_States_relations_during_the_first_Trump_administration) by means of sanctions, withdrew from an [international agreement](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joint_Comprehensive_Plan_of_Action) to limit Iran's nuclear program, and [assassinated](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assassination_of_Qasem_Soleimani) the highest-ranking Iranian military official while they were in Iraq.
> 
> In June 2025, Israel launched an attack on Iran's military and nuclear facilities, sparking a [twelve-day war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Israel_war) between the countries, which ended shortly after the U.S. [dropped "bunker-buster" bombs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_strikes_on_Iranian_nuclear_sites) on three Iranian nuclear sites.
> 
> In December 2025, [protests](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025%E2%80%932026_Iranian_protests) erupted across Iran in what has been described as the largest popular demonstrations in the country since the 1979 revolution. The protests take place in the context of an [economic crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iranian_economic_crisis) exacerbated by international sanctions, while the Iranian government has responded by [killing thousands of protesters](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_Iran_massacres).&#x20;
> 
> U.S. President Trump has previously [threatened](https://www.reuters.com/world/middle-east/iran-warns-retaliation-if-trump-strikes-us-withdraws-some-personnel-bases-2026-01-14/) that the U.S. would intervene on behalf of the protesters, while he has also called for ["new leadership" for Iran](https://www.politico.com/news/2026/01/17/trump-to-politico-its-time-to-look-for-new-leadership-in-iran-00735528). Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed shah, [attempted to position](https://apnews.com/article/iran-protests-reza-pahlavi-trump-shah-63348442feefaaf1cdd7fffc142b2062) himself as a future leader of a secular Iranian state.

> [According to Sentinel](https://blog.sentinel-team.org/p/trump-administration-mulls-strikes), a foresight team that aims to anticipate large-scale catastrophes:
> 
> > Forecasters think there’s a 59% chance (55% to 65%) that the US strikes Iranian territory by March 31, 2026, and a 26.5% chance (10% to 51%) that Ayatollah Khamenei is out of power by then, for any reason (including death). Last week, they gave an aggregate estimate of 43% that the Iranian regime will fall by the end of 2026. Some readers, including some sharp prediction market traders, think those probabilities are too high.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41594) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-28 11:51:38 is higher than 50.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 50.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-28 11:51:38, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-17. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-17 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic or financial data, add a FRED query. Use a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate") or a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE"). Returns historical data with computed statistics.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one Agent query.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant historical context needed to generate an outside view.}

Search queries:
1. your query here (Google)
2. your query here (Google News)
3. your query here (Agent)
4. economic indicator query (FRED) -- only if question involves economic/financial data
