The sources indicate that potential alternatives to the current regime could be even more problematic for the U.S. and its allies, with the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) likely to fill the power vacuum in the near term, as believed by U.S. intelligence. The administration also lacks clarity on the current command structure within the IRGC, unlike its understanding of Venezuela\u2019s leadership prior to the January 3, 2025, operation to capture President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. The sources noted that the window for U.S. intervention to support the Iranian opposition\u2014when it could have shifted the balance\u2014has now closed, and it is unclear whether future attacks would achieve desired outcomes. In addition to nuclear facilities, the U.S. is considering targeting IRGC headquarters and other military sites, with potential joint operations with Israel under discussion. After the 2025 failure to reach a nuclear agreement following Donald Trump\u2019s return to office, both nations conducted a series of strikes on Iranian nuclear sites. In 2026, negotiations resumed, with the second round held in Geneva on February 17, 2026. President Trump stated he would be 'indirectly involved' in the talks, represented by special envoy Steve Witkoff and son-in-law Jared Kushner, expressing hope that Tehran seeks a deal, mindful of the consequences of its hardline stance and last year\u2019s U.S. airstrikes.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 09:06 AM\nSource:[Interfax.ru](https://www.interfax.ru/world/1073194)\n\n**A-10 and F-15 Combat Readiness: If the U.S. Launches a Strike, China and Russia Will Likely Stand With Iran**\nAccording to a report published on February 17, 2026, by Sina News, the United States has deployed A-10 attack jets and F-15E fighter bombers to the Middle East in preparation for a potential military strike against Iran. The A-10s are stationed in Jordan, ready to support ground operations in the Gulf region, while F-15E squadrons have been moved from bases in North Carolina, Idaho, and RAF Lakenheath, UK. The F-15E, a multirole strike aircraft, has been used for both ground attacks and air defense, including protecting Israel from drone threats. Additional assets deployed include EA-18G electronic warfare aircraft, F-35A fighters, MQ-9 drones, and units transferred from Puerto Rico, indicating strain on U.S. military resources. Over 100 large transport aircraft have flown to the region in recent weeks, enabling rapid mobilization should President Trump issue an order. Despite ongoing negotiations in Oman, no progress has been made, and Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian stated that Iran distrusts U.S. intentions, refuses to abandon uranium enrichment, and is consulting with strategic partners China and Russia. The article argues that if the U.S. attacks Iran, China and Russia would likely intervene to prevent Iran\u2019s collapse, as it would severely undermine their strategic position. The U.S. military, citing its 2026 National Security Report, claims success in weakening Iran\u2019s 'resistance axis,' including the Houthis and Palestinian groups, and alleges that Iran\u2019s nuclear program was damaged in the 'Midnight Hammer' operation. However, Iran insists it will not accept U.S.-imposed conditions, such as abandoning nuclear research and missile development. Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu demands that Iran surrender both nuclear ambitions and ballistic missiles, backed by powerful Jewish lobbying groups. Despite Trump\u2019s claim of 'excellent talks' in Oman on February 8, 2026, he immediately issued an executive order imposing tariffs on countries trading with Iran and expanded sanctions. Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian stated that while negotiations represent a step forward, the threat of war remains, and a large-scale conflict could spiral out of control.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 05:28 AM\nSource:[\u641c\u72d0](https://mil.sohu.com/a/987278108_121752857)\n\n**U.S. Escalates Military Pressure on Iran Ahead of High-Stakes Nuclear Talks**\nThe United States is intensifying its military presence in the Middle East ahead of crucial nuclear negotiations with Iran in Geneva on Tuesday, February 18, 2026. U.S. military assets\u2014including fighter jets, aerial refueling planes, and air defense systems\u2014have been redeployed to the region, with over 250 military cargo flights recorded from the U.S. to Jordan, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia. The USS Gerald R. Ford carrier strike group is en route, and the USS Abraham Lincoln group is already in the region, providing extensive strike options. The U.S. has authorized fighter jets to enter Jordanian airspace, and 12 F-15 attack aircraft have been stationed at Jordan\u2019s Muwaffaq Salti Air Base since January 25, 2026. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened military action, stating that a regime change in Iran 'would be the best thing that could happen' and that 'if they don\u2019t succeed, it will be a very bad day for Iran.' The U.S. is preparing for kinetic strikes, with potential targets including Revolutionary Guard headquarters and other military installations beyond nuclear sites. There is also discussion of possible joint U.S.-Israel operations, similar to Operation Midnight Hammer. U.S. officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, acknowledge that no clear successor to Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei is known, and the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) is expected to fill any leadership vacuum. The U.S. lacks detailed intelligence on Iran\u2019s power structure post-Soleimani. While some sources suggest a window for military intervention existed during the January 2026 protests, it is now questioned whether the moment has passed. Iran has conducted military exercises near disputed islands with the UAE and warned Trump that any aggression would lead to a harsh confrontation. The International Atomic Energy Agency\u2019s Rafael Grossi met with Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Geneva for technical discussions. Regional allies, including Gulf states, oppose military action, urging diplomacy, while Israel is the only regional actor pushing for strikes. The U.S. insists it prefers diplomacy, but Rubio emphasized the difficulty of negotiating with Iran due to its clerical leadership and theological decision-making. When asked if Congress would be informed before an attack, Rubio deferred, stating that actions would follow the law and be obvious if changes occurred.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 11:08 PM\nSource:[CNN Espa\u00f1ol](https://cnnespanol.cnn.com/2026/02/16/eeuu/presion-militar-iran-conversaciones-trax)\n\n**U.S. Increases Military Pressure on Iran Ahead of Critical Nuclear Talks**\nThe United States is intensifying its military presence in the Middle East ahead of crucial nuclear negotiations with Iran in Geneva on Tuesday, February 18, 2026. U.S. military assets\u2014including fighter jets, aerial refueling tankers, and air defense systems\u2014are being rapidly redeployed to the region, with over 250 military cargo flights recorded from the U.S. to Jordan, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia in recent weeks. The U.S. Navy\u2019s Abraham Lincoln and Gerald Ford carrier strike groups are now in or en route to the region, providing extensive attack options. The Pentagon has authorized U.S. combat aircraft to enter Jordanian airspace, with 12 F-15 attack jets stationed at Muwaffaq Salti Air Base since January 25, 2026. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened military action, stating that a regime change in Iran 'would be the best thing that could happen' and warning that 'if they don\u2019t succeed, it will be a very bad day for Iran.' The U.S. has no clear understanding of who would lead Iran after a regime collapse, with intelligence sources indicating the hardline Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) would likely fill the power vacuum. The U.S. also lacks clarity on the IRGC\u2019s internal hierarchy following the 2019 assassination of General Qasem Soleimani. While there was a narrow window for kinetic strikes during Iran\u2019s recent protests, sources question whether the moment has passed. The U.S. is now focused on leveraging military pressure to force Iran to abandon all uranium enrichment, a position that contradicts Iran\u2019s claim of its sovereign right to enrich. Diplomatic options remain, including potential economic incentives such as access to Iran\u2019s oil, gas, and rare earth resources. U.N. nuclear chief Rafael Grossi held technical talks with Iran\u2019s Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Geneva prior to the high-stakes negotiations. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio emphasized that Iran is governed by radical Shia clerics who base decisions on theology, making diplomacy difficult, but stated that the U.S. is still pursuing negotiations. Regional allies, including Gulf states, oppose military action and urge more time for diplomacy, while Israel is the only regional actor reportedly pushing for a strike. Iran, meanwhile, conducted military drills near disputed islands with the UAE and warned Trump that any attack would result in a harsh, lasting confrontation. The U.S. has not committed to informing Congress if it decides to launch an attack or attempt to remove Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, stating only that it will follow the law depending on circumstances.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 11:08 PM\nSource:[KESQ.com](https://kesq.com/kunamundo/noticias-cnn/cnn-spanish/2026/02/16/ee-uu-aumenta-la-presion-militar-sobre-iran-antes-de-conversaciones-cruciales/)\n\n**US increases military pressure on Iran ahead of high-stakes talks**\nThe United States is intensifying its military presence in the Middle East ahead of high-stakes nuclear talks with Iran in Geneva on February 16, 2026. US Air Force assets, including refueling tankers and fighter jets from the UK, are being repositioned closer to the region, while dozens of cargo flights have transported military equipment to Jordan, Bahrain, and Saudi Arabia. Satellite imagery confirms 12 F-15 attack planes stationed at Jordan\u2019s Muwaffaq Salti Air Base since January 25, 2026. The US Navy has deployed the USS Abraham Lincoln carrier strike group, with the USS Gerald Ford on the way, accompanied by guided-missile destroyers and F-35/F-15E fighter jets capable of launching Tomahawk missiles with a 1,000-mile range and 1,000-pound warheads. The buildup aims to deter Iran and maintain strike options if diplomacy fails. President Donald Trump has repeatedly threatened military action, calling regime change 'the best thing that could happen' in Iran and asserting that 'if they're not [successful], it's going to be a very bad day for Iran.' US officials, including Secretary of State Marco Rubio, acknowledge a lack of clarity on who would lead Iran post-regime change, with the hardline Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) expected to fill any leadership vacuum. Intelligence gaps persist following the 2020 assassination of Gen. Qasem Soleimani. While some sources believe the US missed a strategic window for kinetic action during the Iranian protests in January 2026, the current military posture now allows for rapid response. Potential targets include IRGC headquarters and nuclear facilities, with speculation of joint US-Israel operations akin to Operation Midnight Hammer. The US insists it does not want any uranium enrichment, rejecting even low-level enrichment, while Iran maintains it as a sovereign right. Economic incentives\u2014such as access to Iran\u2019s oil, gas, and rare earths\u2014may be discussed. UN nuclear chief Rafael Grossi held technical talks with Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi in Geneva. Regional allies, including Gulf states, are urging restraint, while Israel is reportedly pushing for military action.

Leaked reports to the U.S. press reveal that President Donald Trump's strategy toward Iran has shifted from direct military intervention to supporting Israel's pressure campaign. According to CBC News, a critical meeting between Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu approximately two months prior reportedly saw Trump greenlight Israel's potential operations against Iran's ballistic missile infrastructure. The U.S. is expected to provide air refueling, access to regional airspace, logistics support, and real-time intelligence sharing in the event of such an operation. Trump escalated military threats on January 28, 2026, via social media, describing the USS Abraham Lincoln-led fleet\u2014dubbed 'Armada'\u2014as significantly larger and more formidable than the fleet used in the Venezuela operation. Pentagon sources told the Wall Street Journal that the USS George H.W. Bush has been prepared for deployment to the region, aiming to strengthen deterrence should nuclear talks collapse. Amid heightened tensions, Iran and U.S. delegations met in Muscat, Oman, on February 6, 2026. Iran's Foreign Ministry spokesperson, Ismail Bekayi, confirmed the talks ended with an agreement to continue discussions. However, core disagreements remain unresolved, and Washington continues to use its military buildup in the region as a strategic bargaining chip. The USS Abraham Lincoln strike group, deployed to the region on January 26 by CENTCOM, is positioned to serve as a protective shield for Israel in case of an Israeli strike. Experts warn that if Israel attacks Tehran, Iran may target U.S. military bases in the region, creating a high risk that the U.S. would be drawn into conflict even if it claims non-involvement.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 03:25 PM\nSource:[S\u00f6zc\u00fc Gazetesi](https://www.sozcu.com.tr/dunya-abd-iran-i-vuracak-mi-diye-beklerken-gizli-plan-ifsa-oldu-p294506)\n\n**Leaked War Scenario: Iran Would Be Attacked by Israel, Not the U.S.**\nAccording to U.S. media reports, in the event of a failure to reach a nuclear agreement with Iran, it is Israel\u2014not the United States\u2014that is expected to launch attacks on Iran's ballistic missile infrastructure. A confidential meeting approximately two months ago between U.S. President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu reportedly involved discussions on scenarios where the U.S. would provide only military and logistical support to Israel, without direct participation in any strikes. Following the meeting, U.S. military and intelligence agencies developed detailed plans for supporting a potential Israeli operation, including aerial refueling, use of regional airspace, and logistical assistance. The U.S. has significantly increased its military presence in the Middle East amid rising tensions, with the USS Abraham Lincoln aircraft carrier strike group deployed to the region on January 26, 2026, under the justification of supporting regional security and stability. Additionally, according to three unnamed U.S. officials speaking to the Wall Street Journal, the Pentagon had issued instructions for preparations to deploy a second aircraft carrier group, potentially the USS George H.W. Bush, to the region\u2014though no final decision has been made. President Trump had previously warned Iran on January 28, 2026, via social media that a massive 'Armada' was advancing toward Iran, threatening a 'worse attack' if no agreement was reached. The nuclear talks, which had been suspended after Israeli and U.S. attacks on Iran in June 2025, resumed on February 6, 2026, in Oman. Iran\u2019s Foreign Ministry spokesperson Ismail Bekayi confirmed that the talks concluded with mutual agreement to continue negotiations. The renewed talks took place amid heightened U.S.-Iran tensions and a significant buildup of U.S. military forces in the region.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 01:56 PM\nSource:[Haberler](https://www.haberler.com/dunya/gizli-savas-senaryosu-sizdi-iran-i-abd-degil-19573072-haberi/)\n\n**Before Second Round of U.S.-Iran Talks, Netanyahu Sets Conditions, Trump Threatens Air Strikes**\nOn February 15, 2026, Iranian Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi led a diplomatic and technical delegation to Geneva, Switzerland, for the second round of indirect nuclear negotiations with the United States, following the first round held in Muscat, Oman on February 6, 2026. The U.S. confirmed that Special Envoy Brian Hook and Jared Kushner would represent the country in the talks. Iran emphasized that 'the ball is in America\u2019s court' and expressed willingness to compromise, including proposing to dilute 60% of its enriched uranium, while insisting on its right to maintain ballistic missile capabilities for defense. Iran rejected discussions on its missile program, stating that missiles have protected it from attacks by Israel and the U.S. Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu demanded that any U.S.-Iran deal include the complete transfer of all enriched uranium out of Iran, dismantlement of uranium enrichment infrastructure, limitations on Iran\u2019s missile program, and the dismantling of Iran\u2019s regional 'Axis of Resistance.' U.S. President Donald Trump reportedly told Netanyahu in a December 2025 meeting that if no agreement is reached, he would support Israel conducting airstrikes on Iran\u2019s ballistic missile facilities. U.S. military and intelligence officials are reportedly discussing logistical support for such an attack, including aerial refueling and overflight permissions, though Jordan, Saudi Arabia, and the UAE have publicly ruled out allowing their airspace to be used for strikes on Iran or against other nations. The White House focuses on Iran\u2019s nuclear program, while Israel is more concerned about Iran\u2019s rapidly expanding missile capabilities, which some Middle East analysts describe as an immediate threat due to Iran\u2019s ability to strike both Israel and U.S. military bases in the region. Iran currently relies heavily on missiles as its 'sole defense mechanism.'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:24 AM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://news.ifeng.com/c/8qn5bb5LeJE)\n\n**Crude Oil: Softness Ahead of U.S.-Iran Talks Amid Geopolitical Tensions and OPEC+ Signals**\nCrude oil prices showed weakness ahead of the upcoming meeting between the United States and Iran on Tuesday, February 16, 2026. Brent crude fell below $68 per barrel, while West Texas Intermediate (WTI) hovered near $63 per barrel. U.S. President Donald Trump stated on Friday that the best outcome for Iran would be a change in power, increasing pressure ahead of the Geneva talks. This year, crude oil prices have risen nearly 10% due to escalating tensions with Iran and concerns over potential supply disruptions in a region that pumps about one-third of the world\u2019s crude. However, futures have moderated as the threat of an imminent attack has diminished and the International Energy Agency (IEA) revised its demand growth forecast downward for the year. Meanwhile, peace talks led by the U.S. to end the war in Ukraine are set to begin in Geneva on Tuesday, though expectations for a swift resolution and Russian oil return remain low. Drone attacks over the weekend damaged infrastructure at the Temnaya Sea Port and fuel tanks along the Black Sea coast. On the OPEC+ front, some members indicated a possible increase in production in April, arguing that concerns over higher output have been exaggerated, though the group has not committed to any action before its March 1 meeting. A delegate noted that the final decision will depend on whether Trump opts for a military strike against Iran or pursues a nuclear deal with the country.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 02:43 AM\nSource:[hindi.moneycontrol.com](https://hindi.moneycontrol.com/news/commodity/crude-oil-crude-prices-soften-ahead-of-the-us-iran-meeting-what-will-be-the-future-trend-2370572.html)\n\n**In Case of U.S. Attack, Iran Will Win, Afghan Authorities Say**\nThe next round of negotiations between the United States and Iran is scheduled to take place on Tuesday in Geneva. Iranian authorities warned that any U.S. military attack would trigger a decisive and painful response from Iran. U.S. President Donald Trump previously stated that a 'huge armada' is being deployed toward Iran, expressing hope that Tehran would agree to sit at the negotiating table and reach a 'fair and equal' deal requiring complete abandonment of nuclear weapons. Trump also referenced a U.S. military operation called 'Midnight Hammer' conducted in June 2025, in which strikes were carried out on Iranian nuclear facilities, asserting that 'the next attack will be worse' and urging 'not to let this happen'.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 06:07 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0418\u0410 \u041d\u043e\u0432\u043e\u0441\u0442\u0438](https://ria.ru/20260215/iran-2074561340.html)\n\n**U.S. Fleet Moves Toward Iran: Military Expert Svitann Predicts Potential Strike**\nThe United States is moving its fleet closer to Iran, according to military expert Roman Svitann, who spoke in an interview with 24 Kanal on January 27, 2026. He noted that the region now hosts up to a thousand aircraft, including 400 in Israel and over 100 aircraft associated with the U.S. aircraft carrier group. Svitann stated that the U.S. and its allies may launch an attack on military targets in Iran, particularly the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), which he described as the militant wing of Iran's ayatollahs, while the Iranian army remains largely neutral. He emphasized that the U.S. is prepared to initiate strikes but is not yet ready to withstand Iran\u2019s retaliatory missile fire, which includes at least 1,500 remaining ballistic missiles. To counter this, Svitann predicted the deployment of additional THAAD anti-ballistic missile systems\u2014one already in Israel and another likely in the Persian Gulf. He warned that such an attack could lead to a sharp rise in global oil prices, negatively impacting Ukraine. Svitann also claimed that former U.S. President Trump undermined an Iranian uprising by failing to deliver on promises of support after mass protests, resulting in thousands of deaths and arrests. He concluded that a U.S. military strike on Iranian military infrastructure is a real possibility in the near future.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 02:04 PM\nSource:[24 \u041a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b](https://24tv.ua/geopolitics/ru/ssha-perebrasyvajut-avianoscy-storonu-irana-voennyj-jekspert_n2997258)\n\n**Will the U.S. and Iran Go to War in 2026? What Do Prophecies Say?**\nThe article discusses apocalyptic predictions about a potential global conflict, particularly focusing on a major war between the United States and Iran in 2026. It references various prophetic sources, including Baba Vanga, Living Nostradamus, and Nostradamus\u2019s quatrains, which suggest that 2026 could mark the beginning of a 'Third World War' originating in the Middle East or Asia. The article claims that a series of regional conflicts\u2014including Israel-Iran tensions, a U.S. strike on Iranian nuclear sites, and retaliatory missile attacks by Iran on U.S. bases in Qatar and Syria\u2014led to a temporary ceasefire brokered by Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Predictions also include the rise of 'invisible warfare' involving cyberattacks and drones, as well as the deployment of a massive naval fleet in the Persian Gulf, symbolized by the USS Abraham Lincoln. Nostradamus\u2019s Quatrain 77 foretells a 27-year war, widespread destruction, and 'red hail'\u2014interpreted by some as nuclear fallout. Astrological interpretations from Hindu, Islamic, and Christian calendars suggest that 2026 will be a year of upheaval, with the Hindu Vikram Samvat 2083 beginning on March 19, 2026, marked by the 'Raudra Samvatsar' (a destructive year) and the 'Angarak Yoga'\u2014indicating internal strife and external conflict. The article also notes that the Islamic Hijri calendar began year 1448 on June 17, 2026, with planetary alignments suggesting religious conflict. Despite these predictions, the article concludes with a disclaimer that such content is for informational and entertainment purposes only and lacks scientific validation, emphasizing that real outcomes depend on diplomacy and global leadership decisions.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 10:28 AM\nSource:[Webdunia](https://hindi.webdunia.com/astrology-articles/us-iran-war-probability-experts-predictions-126012700037_1.html)\n\n**How Will America Strike Deep into Iran? Israeli Newspaper Forecasts the Method**\nAccording to an Israeli report by 'Haaretz' published on January 26, 2026, a potential future military confrontation between the U.S. and Iran could differ significantly from the previous 12-day conflict in both nature and impact. The article cites a former Israeli intelligence official who stated that both sides have learned lessons from the last war, making the next phase more complex. The report warns against assuming that any U.S. operation against Iran\u2014potentially under a Trump administration\u2014would replicate the 2023 Israeli campaign, which ended with a limited and quickly contained Iranian response. Haaretz emphasizes that warfare tactics do not repeat, referencing Hamas\u2019s October 7, 2023 surprise attack and Israel\u2019s subsequent strikes on Hezbollah and Iranian missile launch sites. The U.S. is reportedly exploring unconventional methods beyond air power, including covert operations and enhanced intelligence capabilities, fueled by debates following its recent action in Venezuela. The goal of a new attack may extend beyond weakening Iran\u2019s missile or nuclear capabilities to undermining the regime itself, making the duration and trajectory of conflict unpredictable. A optimistic scenario envisions a swift collapse of the Iranian regime, while a pessimistic one foresees a prolonged war of attrition that could exceed Israel\u2019s current operational capacity. Israel\u2019s Air Force has returned to pre-October 7, 2023 readiness levels, but these are sufficient only for a short war, not a long-term conflict, due to reduced aircraft lifespan from sustained activity. Economically, Israel has demonstrated resilience under rocket fire, but a new conflict would incur high costs, including lost workdays, reduced investor confidence, and increased defense spending. The defense budget for 2026 may rise above 112 billion shekels. Previous interception operations cost about five billion shekels, and Iran has since rebuilt and improved its missile arsenal, increasing future defense costs. A key reason for delaying a U.S. strike is that Iran has hidden and relocated missile launch sites, reducing the effectiveness of existing target lists.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 04:38 PM\nSource:[Lebanon24](https://www.lebanon24.com/news/world-news/1473658/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%85-%D8%A3%D9%85%D9%8A%D8%B1%D9%83%D8%A7-%D8%B9%D9%85%D9%82-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86%D8%9F-%D8%B5%D8%AD%D9%8A%D9%81%D8%A9-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A9-%D8%AA%D8%AA%D9%88%D9%82%D8%B9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B7%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%82%D8%A9)\n\n**Rocket Strikes on Officials and Generals: Predicted U.S. Attacks on Iran**\nAccording to KP.RU, U.S. betting markets have placed $8 million on the prediction that the United States will launch new strikes against Iran on January 31, 2026, with January 14 as the second most popular date. Analyst Boris Dolgov, a leading research fellow at the Center for Islamic Studies at the Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences, predicts that if President Trump proceeds with military action under the pretext of supporting protesters, the U.S. would conduct targeted strikes against Iranian officials, generals, and prosecutors accused by Western media and Iranian opposition of suppressing protests. The strikes may also target military installations such as Revolutionary Guards (IRGC) barracks and weapon storage sites. Dolgov suggests the U.S. may act in coordination with Israel. In response, Iran could retaliate by attacking U.S. military bases in Syria, Jordan, and Bahrain, or resort to extreme measures such as blocking the Strait of Hormuz, a critical oil export route. Iran is currently pursuing diplomatic engagement. Dolgov attributes the scale of the protests to a combination of factors: a well-fed, educated population (Iran ranks ninth globally in scientific and technological innovation), recent declines in living standards, and the appeal of Western consumer lifestyles promised after sanctions are lifted. He also notes that the U.S. has positioned Reza Pahlavi, the son of the deposed Shah, as a symbolic opposition figure, though many protesters\u2014being young and unfamiliar with pre-1979 Iran\u2014may not be deterred by this. The article suggests that these conditions create a 'color revolution' environment in Iran.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 15, 2026 12:40 PM\nSource:[kp.ru](https://www.kp.ru/daily/27749/5196790/)\n\n**Israeli Assessments Predict Trump May Attack Iran to Force Negotiations Amid Protests**\nIsraeli official media reports that senior Israeli intelligence assessments estimate former U.S. President Donald Trump will launch a military attack on Iran to compel it to negotiate, citing deteriorating economic conditions and widespread protests in Iran since December 28, 2025. The Israel Broadcasting Authority stated that 'in Israel, they estimate that Trump will launch an attack on Iran to force it to negotiate.' According to Israeli security sources, at least 4,000 civilians have been killed during the protests. The Israeli security cabinet (the 'kabinit') was briefed on potential Israeli military plans against Iran on the evening of January 13, 2026. Key issues for negotiation include Iran\u2019s nuclear and ballistic missile programs, which Israel and the U.S. accuse Iran of pursuing for military purposes, while Iran insists its program is for peaceful uses such as electricity generation. Israel, the only unacknowledged nuclear-armed state in the Middle East, has sought U.S. approval to strike Iran, especially after reports that Iran is rebuilding its ballistic missile capabilities damaged in a previous conflict. U.S. and Israeli officials have expressed hopes for the collapse of Iran\u2019s regime since 1979. Trump, via the Truth Social platform, told Iranian protesters: 'Help is on the way' and urged them to 'continue protesting and take control of your institutions.' He announced the cancellation of all meetings with Iranian officials 'until the killing of protesters stops.' Meanwhile, countries including China and Russia have rejected any U.S.-led military intervention in Iran. In June 2025, Israel, with U.S. backing, launched a 12-day war on Iran, which was followed by Iranian retaliation before a U.S.-brokered ceasefire was declared. Israel and Iran remain arch-enemies, exchanging accusations of sabotage and cyberattacks for years.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 07:32 PM\nSource:[Anadolu Ajans\u0131](https://www.aa.com.tr/ar/%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84/%D9%87%D9%8A%D8%A6%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%AB-%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D8%A8%D8%A3%D9%86-%D8%AA%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%A8-%D8%B3%D9%8A%D9%87%D8%A7%D8%AC%D9%85-%D8%A5%D9%8A%D8%B1%D8%A7%D9%86-%D9%84%D8%AF%D9%81%D8%B9%D9%87%D8%A7-%D9%84%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%81%D8%A7%D9%88%D8%B6-/3798483)\n\n**U.S. Military Attack on Iran Probability Surges Past 50% on Prediction Market Amid Escalating Tensions**\nOn January 13, 2026, the Polymarket prediction platform reported that the probability of the United States launching a military attack on Iran had risen to 54%, exceeding 50% for the first time, up 9 percentage points in the past 24 hours. The likelihood of a U.S. military strike occurring by January 23 increased from 29% to 43%. Approximately $13.7 million has been wagered on the outcome. If the U.S. conducts a military attack\u2014via drones, missiles, or airstrikes\u2014on Iranian territory, including embassies and consulates, the market will settle on 'YES'; otherwise, if the attack is prevented, it will be a no-count result. Polymarket, which uses the CRYPTO: POL token, has previously faced criticism for profiting from conflicts and wars. Meanwhile, the probability that Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei will step down this month remains low at 20%. The surge in speculation follows a new travel advisory issued by the U.S. virtual embassy in Iran, warning U.S. citizens to evacuate due to escalating protests that have entered their 16th day. The advisory cites a significant risk of interrogation, arrest, or detention for U.S. passport holders or those perceived to have ties to the U.S. The U.S. virtual embassy serves as a diplomatic platform since the U.S. and Iran do not maintain formal diplomatic relations. According to the U.S.-based nonprofit Human Rights Activist News Agency, at least 656 people, including 505 protesters, have died during the unrest. Iran claims foreign interference is behind the uprising, which began due to public anger over currency devaluation and hyperinflation. The Trump administration is reportedly considering various responses, including military action. Tehran has signaled both readiness for war and willingness to negotiate.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 09:45 AM\nSource:[Benzinga Japan](https://www.benzinga.com/content/49865102/50)\n\n**How AI Outperforms Humans in Forecasting the Future**\nEvery three months, participants in the Metaculus Cup use artificial intelligence to predict geopolitical events in hopes of winning a prize of about $5,000. The platform poses questions such as 'Will Thailand experience a military coup before September\u202f2025?' and 'Will Israel strike the Iranian army again before September\u202f2025?' Experts estimate probabilities rather than simple yes/no answers. For example, Metaculus users correctly predicted the Russian invasion of Ukraine two weeks in advance and assigned a 90\u202f% probability to the U.S. v. Wade case roughly two months before it occurred. When the competition began in June, participants expected AI to outperform humans by 40\u202f% on average, but the Mantic AI system achieved over 80\u202f% accuracy. Prediction experts update their forecasts based on policy changes, allowing them to anticipate how virtual political interventions might affect future outcomes. Broad geopolitical forecasting remains extremely difficult, often requiring days and tens of thousands of dollars for a single question. The Rand Corporation estimates that human experts would need months to produce initial forecasts for all questions and to update them regularly. AI excels in data-rich, well-structured domains like weather or quantitative finance, but for geopolitics it must handle many interrelated factors. Large language models use the same complex information as human forecasters and can simulate human judgment, improving over time by predicting many questions, observing performance, and updating methods on a larger scale than humans can. Machines also have an unfair advantage in the competition: participants earn points not only for accuracy but also for coverage, the number of questions answered, and the frequency of updates. Even less accurate AI can rank highly by continuously updating estimates in response to emerging news\u2014a feat impossible for humans. This unfair advantage helps AI overcome the remaining challenge of producing high\u2011quality predictions for all questions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 11:47 AM\nSource:[elnabaa.net](https://www.elnabaa.net/1136072/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%81%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A4-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
