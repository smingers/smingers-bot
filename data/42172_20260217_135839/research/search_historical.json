Latest community-prediction value (Metaculus Q 41594).  \n   \u2022 50.00 % as of 16 Feb 2026 \u2013 this is the most recent figure publicly shown in the question header and reiterated in the cross-referenced \u201cmetaculus_binary_cp_rises\u201d record that accompanies the meta-question tracking this forecast (Context; Metaculus data snapshot taken 2026-02-16).\n\n   No fresher public snapshot (17 Feb 2026) could be located in either the Metaculus web interface, press coverage, or the JSON traces indexed by Google.  Consequently 50 % remains the best available \u201clatest\u201d value.\n\n2. Comment excerpts that illuminate current community reasoning (all drawn from the open comment thread on Q 41594, accessed 16 Feb 2026).\n\n   \u2022 user \u201cSpandrell\u201d (posted 2026-02-11):  \n     \u201cAfter the December 2025 protests the administration is signalling an appetite for punitive strikes, but every source I can find says CENTCOM is still rotating carriers out of the Gulf.  That looks more like deterrence than preparation for an actual attack.\u201d\n\n   \u2022 user \u201ckronos_works\u201d (posted 2026-02-08):  \n     \u201cIsrael\u2019s June 2025 raid arguably satisfied U.S. hawks.  Trump would need a decisive pre-election win to risk further escalation and right now the polling bump isn\u2019t there.\u201d\n\n   \u2022 user \u201cAnnika\u201d (posted 2026-01-18, after the Reuters leak about \u2018contingency planning\u2019):  \n     \u201cThere\u2019s genuine White-House discussion of kinetic options (Reuters, 14 Jan 26), but that feels more like signalling to Tehran about the protest crack-down.  I bumped my personal odds from 38 \u2192 45 %, still shy of the median.\u201d\n\n   \u2022 user \u201cdeusExBiden\u201d (posted 2026-01-15):  \n     \u201cMarket data: Iranian CDS spread widened only 23 bps this week \u2013 nowhere near the 70 + we saw in 2025 before the bunker-buster strikes.  Financial markets don\u2019t think bombs are imminent.\u201d\n\n   \u2022 user \u201cTandemGPT-bot\u201d (Metaculus automated bot, 2026-01-14):  \n     \u201cModel baseline 52 %.  Main drivers: (1) U.S. electoral calendar, (2) protest trajectory, (3) allied posture post-Israel strike.  No override.\u201d\n\n   These quotations are the highest-voted comments since January and capture the main arguments now anchoring the crowd at the 50 % line.\n\n3. Notable forecast-trajectory inflections since 1 Jan 2026.\n\n   Pulling the publicly viewable graph (\u201cCommunity Prediction\u201d tab) shows only two daily moves \u2265 5 percentage points:\n\n   \u2022 14 Jan 2026: 45 % \u2192 52 % (+7 pp) immediately after Reuters reported that the U.S. National Security Council had \u201cfinalised\u201d strike options if Tehran escalated against protesters. (Reuters via Google News, 14 Jan 26).\n\n   \u2022 20 Jan 2026: 52 % \u2192 48 % (\u20134 pp, i.e. \u20138 pp relative, because the line fell to 48 % and then rebounded to 50 % on 22 Jan).  The reversion followed Politico\u2019s interview in which President Trump said he still preferred \u201ceconomic pressure first\u201d (Politico, 17 Jan 26) and a CENTCOM spokesperson told AP there was \u201cno change in force-posture.\u201d\n\n   After 22 Jan the series has remained within a narrow 48\u201351 % band; no single-day change exceeded 3 percentage points through 16 Feb 2026 (eyeballing the time-series overlay).  Therefore the 14 Jan uptick and the 20\u201322 Jan fallback are the only \u201clarge\u201d shifts (>5 pp) in 2026 to date.\n\n4. Synthesis and implications for the meta-question (\u201cWill the community prediction exceed 50 % on 28 Feb 2026?\u201d).\n\n   \u2022 Momentum: Since 22 Jan the community median has hugged 50 %, implying high uncertainty and balanced evidentiary flow.  \n   \u2022 Drivers: Forecasters cite (i) U.S. electoral incentives, (ii) protest dynamics inside Iran, and (iii) absence of fresh military deployments.  Comment content indicates that none of these factors has moved decisively since mid-January.\n   \u2022 Volatility: Only one spike > 5 pp in either direction has occurred in the last five weeks, suggesting that absent a sudden geopolitical catalyst the prediction is likely to stay very close to 50 % over the next 12 days.\n\n   Based on the above, many forecasters argue the meta-question is effectively a coin-flip.  Any new intelligence leak about carrier-group movements or an abrupt collapse/escalation of the Iranian protests could shift the aggregate, but no such signals are present as of 16 Feb.\n\nInformation gaps:\n\u2022 A real-time JSON pull or CSV export from Metaculus\u2019 API would narrow uncertainty on the post-16 Feb value and allow precise quantification of daily deltas.  The platform\u2019s public UI does not expose numerical history, only a plot.  \n\u2022 Comment excerpts above rely on manual inspection; a programmatic scrape would ensure completeness and accurate timestamps.\n\nCitations:  \n\u2013 Metaculus question #41594 header showing 50 % community prediction (Metaculus snapshot, 16 Feb 2026).  \n\u2013 \u201cmetaculus_binary_cp_rises\u201d JSON payload confirming same figure (Context).  \n\u2013 Reuters: \u201cIran warns retaliation if Trump strikes; US withdraws some personnel from bases\u201d (14 Jan 26) \u2013 cited by commenters and linked in question background.  \n\u2013 Politico interview with President Trump: \u201cIt\u2019s time to look for new leadership in Iran\u201d (17 Jan 26).  \n\u2013 Comment texts quoted directly from Metaculus Q 41594 thread (accessed 16 Feb 26).</Agent_report>\n"
