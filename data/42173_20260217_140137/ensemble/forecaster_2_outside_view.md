Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**CNBC - Nvidia dominates AI chip market (June 2, 2024)**
High-quality source with concrete market share data (70-95%), financial metrics, and named expert opinions. Factual: market share, margins, revenue figures. Opinions: competitive concerns from various CEOs. Date is ~20 months before forecast period, providing baseline context but limited predictive value.

**Yahoo Finance - Big Tech spending drove Nvidia's rise (May 24, 2025)**
Credible financial journalism with specific spending breakdowns. Factual: Microsoft spending 47% of capex on Nvidia chips (19% of Nvidia revenue), Meta 25% (9% of revenue). Opinion: DA Davidson analyst Gil Luria warns of concentration risk and custom chip competition. Date is 8 months before forecast target, highly relevant.

**CNBC - Nvidia Q3 2024 earnings (November 20, 2024)**
Primary source financial data. Factual: 94% YoY revenue growth (slowing from 122%+), Blackwell in production, supply constraints expected through fiscal 2026. Date is 15 months old, shows trajectory but predates recent events.

**Nvidia - Blackwell Architecture (undated promotional content)**
Company marketing material. Factual: technical specifications (208B transistors, performance claims). All performance claims are company-stated, not independently verified. Limited forecasting value beyond confirming product exists.

**Manifold Markets (undated)**
Prediction market showing 15% probability on same question. Factual: current market odds. This is a crowd-sourced forecast, not expert analysis. Useful as comparison point.

**Entropic Thoughts blog (January 20, 2026)**
Individual analyst using options pricing methodology. Factual: stock at $184, options pricing data. Opinion: author estimates 10% probability using volatility analysis. Recent (4 weeks old) and methodologically sound, though single-source. Author acknowledges surprise at "high" 10% estimate.

**TechStock² - Nvidia premarket slip (February 13, 2026)**
Recent news (4 days old). Factual: stock at $186.94, earnings scheduled Feb 25, 2026. Multiple expert opinions quoted but focused on near-term earnings, not crash probability. CPI concerns and "prove it" year commentary suggests elevated uncertainty.

**Yahoo Finance - Goldman Sachs forecast (February 8, 2026)**
High-quality analyst report (9 days old). Factual: Goldman maintains $250 target (+35% from $185), expects $67.3B Q4 revenue. Opinion: Goldman notes "upside largely priced in" and identifies both risks (competition) and catalysts (hyperscaler spending, China reopening, Rubin chip). Bullish overall but acknowledges execution risk.

**CNBC - Market rotation out of tech (February 2, 2026)**
Recent market commentary (15 days old). Factual: Nvidia down 3%, software sector down 28% from peak. Expert opinions (Josh Brown, Bill Northey) note risk-off sentiment in tech and AI disruption concerns. Sentiment indicator rather than fundamental analysis.

**Agent Report - Timeline of events**
Synthesizes regulatory timeline. Factual: December 2025 H200 China approval with revenue-sharing, January 2026 25% tariff and Chinese customs blocks, February 2026 earnings anticipation. Critical information: China revenue disruption is recent and material. Notes missing data: actual Metaculus prediction time series.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **High-flying tech stocks experiencing 45%+ crashes within a year**: Examples include Meta (2022: $384→$88, -77%), Cisco (2000-2001: $80→$13, -84%), Netflix (2022: $700→$162, -77%). However, these typically involved fundamental business model threats or severe macro shocks. Suitability: Moderate - captures magnitude but may overstate probability.

2. **Nvidia's own historical volatility**: Stock has experienced multiple 40%+ drawdowns in its history (2018: -50%, 2022: -66%). However, current market cap ($1.8T+) and institutional ownership differ from earlier periods. Suitability: High - same company, similar question.

3. **Dominant platform companies facing competitive threats**: Microsoft (1990s-2000s), Intel (2010s), Cisco (2000s) maintained dominance despite competition. Crashes typically required major secular shifts. Suitability: Moderate-High - captures competitive dynamics.

4. **Prediction markets/forecaster consensus on similar tech stock crash questions**: Historical Metaculus/Manifold accuracy on specific stock predictions. Limited data available but relevant. Suitability: High if data available.

**Selected reference class**: Nvidia's own historical volatility combined with current prediction market consensus, as this balances company-specific factors with crowd wisdom.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 10 days (Feb 17 → Feb 26, 2026) for the meta-question; underlying question covers 318 days remaining in 2026 (Feb 17 → Dec 31, 2026).

**Current context (as of Feb 17, 2026)**:
- Stock at ~$186-187
- Needs to drop to <$100 (-46% minimum)
- Earnings release Feb 25 (8 days away) - major catalyst
- Currently 12% community prediction on Metaculus
- 15% on Manifold
- 10% from options-based analysis (Entropic Thoughts)

**Historical patterns**:
- Nvidia has never experienced a 45%+ single-day crash
- Post-earnings moves: typically ±5-15%, rarely >20%
- 2022 drawdown took 9 months to reach -66% trough
- 2018 drawdown took 3 months to reach -50%
- Fastest historical path to -45% would require sustained selling over weeks/months, not days

**Critical factor**: With only 10 days until meta-question resolution and 318 days for underlying question, the meta-question is essentially asking whether new information in the next 10 days will cause forecasters to raise their estimate above 12%.

## (d) Justification

The outside view suggests the current 12% Metaculus prediction is reasonable, possibly slightly low:

**Factors supporting higher probability (>12%)**:
1. Recent China revenue disruption (Jan 2026 tariffs + customs blocks) creates material downside risk not fully reflected in Dec 2025 baseline
2. Options markets imply ~10% probability (Entropic Thoughts analysis)
3. Software sector already down 28% from peak, indicating broader AI skepticism
4. Historical Nvidia volatility: has experienced 40-50%+ drawdowns twice in past 8 years
5. Concentration risk: 50% of revenue from handful of hyperscalers who are developing competing chips
6. Goldman Sachs notes "upside largely priced in" - limited margin for disappointment

**Factors supporting lower probability (<12%)**:
1. Strong fundamental demand: Goldman expects $67B Q4 revenue, Blackwell ramping
2. Hyperscaler capex increasing ($527B projected for 2026)
3. China H200 orders worth $3.2B despite restrictions
4. No historical precedent for 45% crash in <1 year from current position of strength
5. Stock would need to fall below $100 on "any day" - a single flash crash or panic sell-off could trigger resolution even if fundamentals remain strong

**Meta-question specific considerations**:
The question asks if the community prediction will rise above 12% by Feb 26. Key events in next 10 days:
- Feb 25 earnings release (8 days away)
- Any pre-earnings guidance or leaks
- Macro events (CPI data mentioned in sources)

If earnings disappoint or guidance is weak, forecasters would likely raise probability significantly. If earnings beat, probability would likely fall. The current 12% represents a balanced view before this major catalyst.

## Outside view calibration:

**Tethering to existing estimates**:
- Metaculus community: 12%
- Manifold market: 15%
- Options-based analysis: 10%
- Average of these: ~12.3%

**Calibration considerations**:
1. The 10-15% range represents informed consensus across multiple forecasting methods
2. Historical base rate for 45%+ Nvidia crashes: ~2 occurrences in 26 years ≈ 7.7% annual probability, but both occurred during broader market stress
3. Current macro environment: tech rotation ongoing but not crisis-level
4. The "any day in 2026" criterion makes this more likely than "end of 2026" - increases probability by ~20-30% vs. point estimate
5. Recent negative catalysts (China restrictions) not yet fully reflected in Dec 2025 baseline prediction

**Upset rate consideration**: In tech stock predictions, major surprises occur ~15-20% of the time when consensus is confident. Current consensus is already uncertain (12%), suggesting appropriate calibration.

Given the convergence of multiple methodologies around 10-15%, recent negative catalysts, and the "any day" resolution criterion, I calibrate toward the upper end of this range but not dramatically higher. The Feb 25 earnings represent a major information event that could shift probabilities significantly, but absent that information, the current consensus appears well-calibrated.

Outside View Prediction: 13.5%
