Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / alignment
This meta-question resolves **Yes** if the Metaculus community prediction for “NVDA closes below $100 on any day in 2026” is **> 12.00%** at **2026-02-26 08:50:50**; otherwise **No**. (If the target question resolves before then, this resolves to the same value.)

(a) Source analysis (what each says; quality/date; fact vs opinion)
- Investing.com analysis (Feb 2026): Reports broad sell-side bullishness (52 analysts, ~96% buy bias, high price targets) and cites upcoming catalysts (earnings late Feb, GTC mid-March). Mix of facts (targets, ownership) and author technical-pattern opinion. Medium reliability (market commentary).
- AOL / Motley Fool opinion (Jan 14, 2026): Argues NVDA could fall < $100 due to “bubble” pattern, valuation, and competition. Mostly narrative; some factual valuation metrics. Low-to-medium reliability (opinion/service marketing).
- Motley Fool (Feb 15, 2026) “unstoppable stock”: Very bullish; cites backlog/guidance and an external bull (Beth Kindig) projecting $20T by 2030. Contains real reported figures, but conclusion is promotional. Medium reliability for numbers; low for price targets.
- Economic Times market-wrap (recent): Macro-driven tech selloff; NVDA near ~$189; includes 52-week low $86.62 (likely split-adjusted). Market-wrap factuals are plausible; outlet is mixed quality, but the specific-day prints are checkable. Moderate.
- Mitrade “bubble panic” explainer: General investing advice; acknowledges “crash risk” but is not independent journalism. Low reliability.
- EBC (Feb 5, 2026): Technical indicators + narrative that decline is discount-rate/policy risk; mentions $4.5B inventory charge related to H20 excess inventory/obligations and China foreclosed quote. Likely based on filings/earnings commentary but the site is less established. Moderate for direction; verify-critical claims.
AskNews set:
- Motley Fool “Where will NVDA be in 1 year?” (Feb 17, 2026): Bullish long-term; argues capex continues; mostly opinion with some capex figures. Medium/low.
- Nasdaq.com repost / MF “Why underperforming in 2026?” (Feb 17, 2026): Mix of facts (P/E, in-house chips, capex vs FCF) and interpretation that this pressures sentiment. Medium.
- Stockpulse snippet (Feb 16, 2026): “NVDA -2.21% … earnings Feb 25.” Data-like feed; usually factual but thin context. Moderate.
- finanzen.net (Feb 16, 2026): Earnings preview with TipRanks-style consensus, mentions $500B visibility. Generally credible for summarizing analyst expectations. Moderate-high for “what analysts expect,” not for outcome.
- MF “difficult to live up to expectations” (Feb 16, 2026): Bearish-on-reaction thesis; cites in-house chips and easing scarcity. Opinion; some factual context. Medium/low.
- Investing.com Russia market note (Feb 16, 2026): Macro/rotation narrative. Moderate.
- MF “3 predictions for 2026” (Feb 15, 2026): Bullish; includes China-reopening speculation. Opinion-heavy. Medium/low.
- MF “stock will soar…” (Jan 31, 2026): Opinion with named bull/bear analyst targets. Medium for “targets exist,” low for “will happen.”
- Yahoo Finance (Nov 28, 2025) Polymarket odds: Useful as a market-sentiment snapshot; markets can be informative but not definitive. Moderate.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to what moves the *community prediction above 12% by Feb 26*)
Key: this is about **near-term movement in the Metaculus aggregate**, not the true probability of NVDA<100.

Strong evidence
- **A major information event occurs inside the window:** NVDA earnings are scheduled **Feb 25**, one day before the snapshot. Multiple sources note this. Earnings are the likeliest catalyst to move community forecasts materially and quickly (direct causal mechanism: new guidance, margins, China commentary).
- **Tug-of-war narrative is salient and widely repeated:** competition/in-house chips, China restrictions, discount-rate sensitivity. Even if not decisive, widespread repetition increases the chance forecasters “re-rate” tail risk around earnings.

Moderate evidence
- **Analyst consensus remains strongly bullish / high targets** (Investing.com; finanzen.net): tends to **pull** forecasts *down* (less crash probability), or at least dampen upward moves absent a shock.
- **AI-bubble / “lofty expectations” framing** (Motley Fool pieces; Nasdaq.com repost): increases perceived downside tail risk *conditional on* any stumble; could push community probability *up* if earnings reaction is negative or guidance disappoints.

Weak evidence
- Technical chart patterns (bullish pennant, RSI/MACD) and generic “bubble panic” content: could influence some forecasters but is noisy and often non-predictive for Metaculus CP changes over 9 days.
- One-off daily market drops/sector rotation blurbs: may nudge sentiment but usually fade unless reinforced by earnings/macro surprises.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time until this meta-question snapshot: **9 days** (Feb 17 → Feb 26 morning).
- The snapshot is *immediately after* an earnings event (Feb 25), so the distribution is “mostly flat until earnings, then a jump.”
- If the timeframe were **halved** (~4–5 days, i.e., before earnings), I’d expect less movement and more stickiness around 12%, making “>12%” closer to a coin-flip but slightly *below* due to bullish drift (maybe high-30s%).
- If the timeframe were **doubled** (~18 days, still pre-GTC but with more post-earnings digestion), mean reversion after the earnings reaction could pull back toward ~12; effect ambiguous, but I’d expect modestly higher chance to cross above 12 at least once—yet the question is a single-time snapshot, so not much higher (low-to-mid 40s%).

(d) Justification (how I move from the outside view to inside view for the *meta* question)
Outside view base rate (given): I previously set **13.5%** as a plausible true probability for the underlying “NVDA < $100 sometime in 2026,” slightly above the current Metaculus 12%. But the meta-question is: will the *community* move **above 12** by Feb 26?

Status quo if nothing changes: community stays ~12% (No). Metaculus medians can be sticky absent major updates.

Inside-view driver: **earnings on Feb 25** will likely dominate last-minute edits. I expect markets/analysts to be broadly optimistic going in (many “buy” ratings; high targets), which creates a slight asymmetry: a “good” report may reduce perceived tail risk (community drifts below 12), while a “bad/uncertain” report can increase tail risk quickly (community jumps above 12). Because expectations are high and narratives about valuation/competition are salient, I assign a non-trivial probability of a negative or ambiguous earnings interpretation that pushes CP upward.

Simple scenario model for CP at the snapshot (Feb 26 morning):
- Positive earnings reaction / reassuring guidance (CP tends to fall below 12): ~45%
- Neutral/mixed reaction (CP near 12; small random drift decides): ~30%
- Negative reaction / guidance uncertainty / clear margin-China downside (CP rises above 12): ~25%

Mapping these to “CP > 12” at the snapshot:
- Positive: ~20% chance still ends >12 (some forecasters may “buy volatility” anyway)
- Neutral: ~40% chance ends >12 (small movements around threshold)
- Negative: ~80% chance ends >12

Total ≈ 0.45*0.20 + 0.30*0.40 + 0.25*0.80 = 0.09 + 0.12 + 0.20 = **0.41**.
Add a tiny increment for the extremely unlikely case NVDA actually closes <100 before Feb 26 (which would force target to resolve Yes early): ~0.1% absolute.
Net inside-view ≈ **0.42**.

Probability calibration
The question is finely balanced because the threshold equals the current CP (12.00%). With earnings one day before the measurement, I expect a meaningful chance of crossing upward, but the prevailing bullish analyst backdrop and “demand/backlog” narrative slightly favors stability or a drift downward. I therefore land modestly below 50%.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Yes iff target Metaculus CP for “NVDA < $100 any day in 2026” is >12.00% at 2026-02-26 08:50:50 (or target resolves earlier).
2. Outside view base rate noted: underlying-event base rate previously 13.5% (community currently 12.0%).
3. Consistency line: 42 out of 100 times, the community CP on Feb 26 is >12.00%.
4. Key evidence (<=20 words each):
   - Feb 25 earnings immediately precedes snapshot; likely to cause last-minute forecast updates.
   - Strong bullish analyst consensus creates downside-tail damping unless earnings disappoint.
   - Salient AI-bubble/competition/China narratives can spike tail-risk estimates on any stumble.
5. Blind spot: A large coordinated/bot update (or Metaculus UI/aggregation change) could shift CP mechanically above 12.
6. Status quo: CP often sticky; absent a clear earnings disappointment, it may stay ~12 or drift slightly down.

Probability: 42%
