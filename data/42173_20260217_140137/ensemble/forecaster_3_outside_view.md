Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality; facts vs opinions)

- **CNBC (Jun 2, 2024) – “Nvidia dominates…”**  
  - **Usefulness:** Background on Nvidia’s dominance, margins, and competitive landscape.  
  - **Quality/date:** High-quality mainstream outlet but **old** relative to the 2026-02-26 forecast date.  
  - **Facts vs opinions:** Market share/margins and customer descriptions are factual claims; commentary about competition is analyst/executive opinion.  
  - **Relevance to *this* question:** Indirect—helps bound plausibility of a crash scenario, but doesn’t inform *Metaculus community prediction movements over 9 days*.

- **Yahoo Finance (May 24, 2025) – “Big Tech’s spending drove Nvidia’s rise”**  
  - **Usefulness:** Concentration risk (hyperscalers are major customers) and the “in-house chip” substitution narrative.  
  - **Quality/date:** Reasonably solid; somewhat dated.  
  - **Facts vs opinions:** Customer spend shares are factual (via Bloomberg compilation); DA Davidson analyst view is opinion.  
  - **Relevance:** Indirect driver of perceived downside risk; could influence forecasters’ longer-run crash probability, but not a strong guide for short-horizon CP drift.

- **CNBC (Nov 20, 2024) – earnings report**  
  - **Usefulness:** Historical growth/margin context; Blackwell supply constraint narrative.  
  - **Quality/date:** Good reporting but old.  
  - **Relevance:** Indirect.

- **Nvidia.com Blackwell architecture page (undated promotional content)**  
  - **Usefulness:** Product positioning; “full production” claims.  
  - **Quality/date:** Primary source but marketing; optimistic bias.  
  - **Relevance:** Weak-to-moderate; may contribute to bullish sentiment, potentially lowering crash odds.

- **Manifold market on the same event (current ~15%)**  
  - **Usefulness:** A second crowd signal of the *underlying* probability (close < $100 any day in 2026).  
  - **Quality/date:** Timely, but thin liquidity and different participant pool; can be noisy.  
  - **Facts vs opinions:** It’s a market price (a revealed-preference “opinion”).  
  - **Relevance:** **Directly relevant** as an outside-view anchor for where Metaculus might drift (Metaculus 12% vs Manifold 15%).

- **Entropic Thoughts (Jan 20, 2026) – options-based estimate ~10%**  
  - **Usefulness:** Another quantitative anchor; tries to infer probability from options.  
  - **Quality/date:** Recent and method-driven, but it’s a single author and model risk is substantial.  
  - **Facts vs opinions:** The option price cited is a factual claim (if correct); the 10% probability is a model-based judgment.  
  - **Relevance:** **Directly relevant** as an outside-view numeric tether (suggests 10% rather than 15%).

- **TechStock² (Feb 13, 2026) – pre-earnings jitters**  
  - **Usefulness:** Establishes that the market is focused on CPI and **Feb 25 earnings**; tone: “prove it year.”  
  - **Quality/date:** Recent but less-established outlet; largely a synthesis of Reuters/Barron’s quotes.  
  - **Relevance:** Relevant mainly because it flags a near-term “information event” likely to move forecasters and thus the Metaculus CP.

- **Yahoo Finance (Feb 8, 2026) – Goldman ahead of earnings, $250 PT**  
  - **Usefulness:** Shows at least one major sell-side stance is still bullish; also highlights that upside may be “priced in,” increasing sensitivity to guidance.  
  - **Quality/date:** Recent; summarizing a known institution.  
  - **Facts vs opinions:** Price target and Goldman commentary are opinions; capex figures are presented as factual estimates.  
  - **Relevance:** Mixed: bullish PT argues against crash odds rising, but “priced in” framing implies higher downside-tail sensitivity to disappointment (which could raise crash odds).

- **CNBC (Feb 2, 2026) – rotation out of tech**  
  - **Usefulness:** Macro/sector risk-off tone; increased volatility in tech could raise tail-risk perceived probabilities.  
  - **Quality/date:** Recent and credible.  
  - **Relevance:** Indirect but could nudge forecasters upward on crash-risk.

- **Agent report (time series missing; list of policy/demand events)**  
  - **Usefulness:** Points out a key missing input (Metaculus CP time series) and compiles export-control related developments.  
  - **Quality/date:** Mixed; some cited outlets are not provided directly here, and the report itself notes gaps. Treat specific claims (tariff mechanics, China blocking shipments) cautiously unless independently verified.  
  - **Relevance:** The most relevant part is simply: **there are plausible news catalysts**, and the CP time series is unavailable.

**Bottom line from sources:** We have two quantitative anchors for the *underlying* event probability (≈10% from an options-based blog; ≈15% from Manifold), while Metaculus sits at **12%**. We also have a strong near-term catalyst (earnings on **Feb 25**) that could cause the Metaculus community prediction to move meaningfully in either direction.

### (b) Reference class analysis (outside view baselines)

Possible reference classes for “Will Metaculus CP be > 12.00% in ~9 days?”:

1. **Metaculus CP short-horizon movements around major scheduled information events (earnings/CPI/Fed) for popular stocks.**  
   - **Pros:** Closest to the actual variable being forecast (CP movement).  
   - **Cons:** We don’t have a dataset here; CP changes are path-dependent and influenced by platform participation.

2. **Direction-of-change from a current CP threshold over ~1–2 weeks when the threshold is exactly the current value.**  
   - **Pros:** General: absent strong directional info, “up vs down” is often near 50/50.  
   - **Cons:** Does not incorporate drift toward other public signals (prediction markets/options sentiment).

3. **Mean-reversion / convergence of Metaculus to other contemporaneous crowd signals (Manifold/options-implied blog estimate).**  
   - **Pros:** Uses available numeric anchors (10% and 15%).  
   - **Cons:** Metaculus may not converge quickly; it can be sticky unless many participants act.

**Most suitable:** A hybrid of (2) and (3): start near 50/50 for “above vs below today’s exact value,” then adjust modestly toward convergence with external anchors (Manifold 15% vs blog 10%) and the presence of an imminent catalyst (earnings) that increases variance but not obviously direction.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Today:** 2026-02-17  
- **Checkpoint:** 2026-02-26 08:50:50 (≈ **9 days** away)

Key timing nuance: Nvidia earnings are scheduled for **Feb 25, 2026** (after market close is typical). By early Feb 26 UTC morning, there will likely be headlines/after-hours price action, and Metaculus users/bots may update quickly. So relative to a normal quiet week, we should expect **higher-than-usual CP movement magnitude**—but the **direction** depends on whether earnings/guidance is perceived as strengthening or weakening the chance of a deep drawdown later in 2026.

---

### (d) Justification (outside view synthesis)

- **Status quo if nothing changes:** CP stays ~12%, and the event “CP > 12%” would be false. But “nothing changes” is unlikely because (i) Metaculus receives incremental forecasts daily and (ii) earnings is a major prompt for updates.

- **Symmetry point:** Because the threshold is *exactly* the current CP (12.00%), a naive outside view would start near **50%** for being higher vs lower at a later timestamp (especially when we expect *some* movement).

- **Drift considerations from external anchors:**  
  - Manifold at **~15%** provides mild upward pressure relative to Metaculus 12%.  
  - Entropic Thoughts at **~10%** provides mild downward pressure.  
  Net: external anchors are **bracketing** Metaculus, with a slight skew upward if you weight Manifold more (it’s a contemporaneous crowd), or downward if you weight options-model blog more (but model risk is substantial). This looks close to balanced.

- **Catalyst and volatility:** Earnings plus risk-off tech sentiment increases dispersion. Increased dispersion *alone* doesn’t make “higher” more likely than “lower,” but it does mean the CP is less likely to sit exactly at 12.00%.

Putting this together as an outside view: slightly above 50% seems reasonable, with only a **small** tilt upward because (i) there exists a visible alternative crowd signal above 12% (Manifold ~15%) and (ii) risk narratives (tech rotation/export controls) can bias tail-risk perceptions upward in the short run.

Outside view calibration:

- I’m aiming to estimate the true probability that the Metaculus CP at the specified timestamp is **strictly greater than 12.00%**.  
- With the threshold equal to the current value and a major update catalyst, the natural base rate is near **50%**, then I apply a **modest** adjustment upward (not large, because we also have a 10% anchor, and bullish sell-side commentary can pull downward).  
- Upsets/unexpected outcomes are common in *short-horizon crowd aggregates* (small participation shocks, bot updates, or a single influential forecaster can move a median). That argues against extreme confidence (not 70/30).

Outside View Prediction:
**56.20%**
