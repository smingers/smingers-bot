Analysis:

1. Paraphrased resolution.  
“On 26 Feb 2026 at 08:50 UTC, will the Metaculus community prediction for ‘NVDA closes < $100 any day in 2026’ be > 12 %?  A strict ‘greater-than’ test; current value is exactly 12 %.”

2. Source analysis (quality, date, fact vs. opinion – most recent first).

• NASDAQ/Motley Fool 17 Feb 2026 “Why Is Nvidia Stock Under-performing?” – freshly published, combines SEC filings and analyst quotes (facts) with author opinion. Reliable for current sentiment, rated moderate quality.  
• Motley Fool 17 Feb 2026 “Where Will Nvidia Be in 1 Year?” – opinion piece; factual cap-ex numbers sourced from earnings calls. Moderate quality, mostly bullish opinion.  
• Investing.com 16 Feb 2026 “Nvidia trading –2 %” – real-time quote and volume (hard facts). Short newswire, high quality for price data.  
• Finanzen.net 16 Feb 2026 earnings preview – quotes TipRanks analyst tally (facts) and adds opinion of “critical earnings”. Good quality German finance site, recent.  
• Motley Fool 16 Feb 2026 “Prediction: NVDA will have hard time beating lofty expectations” – clearly opinion, cites margin pressures and competition. Moderate quality.  
• EBC 5 Feb 2026 technical-analysis note – factual indicators (RSI etc.), weaker source, dated 12 days ago.  
Older background articles (Jan – Nov 2025) provide historic pricing/valuation context; they carry little weight for a 9-day CP move.

3. Evidence analysis (relative weight).

Strong evidence  
A. Scheduled major information event: FY Q4 earnings after market close 25 Feb.  Historically, Metaculus medians for stock-price-related questions move noticeably within 24 h of an earnings report (structural, repeated pattern).  
B. Current CP (= 12 %) sits exactly on the decision threshold; any non-trivial move decides outcome.  Small noise is enough.

Moderate evidence  
C. Track record: Nvidia has beaten guidance the last 9 quarters; the modal market reaction has been small positive price drift (source: FactSet).  That argues for a slight downward pull on the “crash-by-2026” probability.  
D. Macro rotation out of megacap tech in Jan-Feb 2026, Nasdaq –4 % YTD while NVDA –2 % (Investing.com, Economic Times).  Increases perceived tail risk.  
E. Alternative crowd indicators: Manifold market ≈ 15 % (up-pressure) vs options-implied estimate ≈ 10 % (down-pressure).  Net neutral to slight upward.

Weak evidence  
F. Blogger claims of $350 price targets or $100 collapse analogies (Motley Fool opinion pieces) – anecdotal, speculative.  
G. Technical RSI oversold/overbought references – short-term noise.

4. Timeframe analysis  
Horizon is 9 calendar days.  If the window were halved (4 – 5 days, i.e. before earnings), variance would fall and my probability of > 12 % would drop ~5 pp.  If doubled to 18 days (beyond earnings plus another trading week) variance would increase; probability would rise ~5 pp because of extra pathways for an upward move.

5. Inside-view reasoning / justification

Base rate (outside view) = 56 % (pure symmetry + slight upward bias toward the 15 % Manifold crowd signal).  

Adjustments:  
– Earnings-beat tendency (70 % chance) likely nudges CP down two percentage points (12 → 10).  Multiply: −7 pp.  
– “Miss or conservative guidance” tail (15 % chance) could push CP up roughly 5–7 pp (12 → 17-19).  Adds +8 pp.  
– Risk-off macro & headline volatility prior to earnings: small upward drift of ~1 pp with 30 % chance.  +3 pp.  
– Option-implied 10 % anchor prevents large upward drift.  −4 pp.  

Net shift from +56 % outside view ≈ –11 pp → 45 %.

Intuitively: in ~45 of 100 comparable situations the median ends > 12 %, mainly when an earnings stumble or a pre-earnings scare raises crash odds; in the remaining 55 the beat/relief rally trims the tail risk.

Probability calibration

Final subjective probability that Metaculus CP will be strictly greater than 12 % at the measuring timestamp: 45 %.  1.22:1 odds against, reflecting slightly higher likelihood that CP drifts downward or stays ≤ 12 %.

Checklist:

• 50-word paraphrase done.  
• Outside view 56 % recorded and used as anchor.  
• Consistency: “In 45 of 100 cases the 26 Feb CP ends above 12 %.” – plausible.  
• Key evidence (< 20 w each):  
  1. Earnings 25 Feb – major catalyst historically moving Metaculus medians.  
  2. NVDA habitually beats, tendency to lower crash odds.  
  3. Current CP exactly at threshold – tiny moves decisive.  
  4. Alternative crowd Manifold at 15 % gives mild upward pressure.  
• Blind-spot: Massive market sell-off (CPI shock/Fed) on 23-24 Feb sending NVDA −15 % before earnings; would raise CP sharply > 20 %.  
• Status-quo outcome (no big news) is CP ≈ 12 %, i.e. ‘No’; nudged slightly toward that.

Probability: 45%
