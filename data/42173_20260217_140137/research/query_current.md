Analysis:
To gauge whether Metaculus forecasters will push the probability above 12 % by 26 Feb 2026, the most relevant inputs are: 1) very recent movements in Nvidia’s share price and volatility, 2) fresh analyst or media commentary hinting at an impending slowdown, policy shock, or earnings miss large enough to make a sub-$100 print plausible, and 3) any market-wide risk factors (rates, recession fears, China sanctions) that could cascade into bearish sentiment. News or commentary published in the last few days on Nvidia’s guidance, chip demand, competitive threats, export-control changes, or macro sell-offs will therefore be most useful.
