Analysis:
The key driver of whether the Metaculus community prediction rises above 12 % in the next nine days is new information that would make a ≥ $100→$ <100 collapse in NVDA look more plausible.  Relevant historical context therefore includes:  
• How this particular Metaculus forecast has moved since it was opened (to see if it is already drifting upward or downward).  
• Recent and near-term catalysts that could change sentiment—especially Nvidia’s next earnings release, analyst downgrades/price-target cuts, additional China export-control headlines, or large-cap tech sell-offs.  
• Precedent: how community odds on comparable “large-price-drop” questions for big tech stocks have reacted around earnings or shock news.  
Gathering that context requires (a) the Metaculus discussion page/time-series data, (b) the latest business/market news on Nvidia, and (c) a synthesis of both.  The following queries target those needs.
