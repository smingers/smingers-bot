Here's What History Has to Say.\"\n\n**Source:** AOL (The Motley Fool)  \n**Date:** January 14, 2026  \n**Author:** Sean Williams\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- **Recent Performance:** Since the beginning of 2023, Nvidia has added more than $4.1 trillion in market value and briefly became the only public company to reach the $5 trillion market cap plateau.\n\n- **Current Stock Position:** Nvidia stock is within striking distance of $200 per share (as of article date).\n\n- **Valuation Metrics:** \n  - In early November, Nvidia's price-to-sales (P/S) ratio tipped above 30\n  - Current trailing 12-month P/S ratio: 24.3\n  - Historically, a P/S ratio of 30 or above for a company leading technological innovation has indicated the presence of a bubble\n\n- **Gross Margin:** Nvidia's gross margin has surged into the mid-70% range\n\n- **Market Context:** The current stock market is the second priciest in history, dating back to January 1871\n\n## Arguments for Why Stock Could Fall Below $100:\n\n**1. Historical Technology Bubble Pattern:**\n- Every game-changing technological advancement for more than three decades has navigated through an early innings bubble-bursting event\n- Technologies cited: internet, genome decoding, nanotechnology, 3D printing, blockchain, metaverse\n- Article argues investors tend to overestimate early-stage adoption, utilization, and optimization rates of new technologies\n- Businesses are likely years away from optimizing AI hardware to maximize sales and profits\n\n**2. Valuation Concerns:**\n- Current P/S ratio of 24.3 remains historically high\n- If the S&P 500 loses 20% or more of its value in 2026, companies with premium valuations like Nvidia would be expected to suffer outsize declines\n\n**3. Competition Risks:**\n- Nvidia's top customers (by net sales) are developing internally developed GPUs\n- While these internal GPUs can't match Nvidia's compute capabilities, they are \"notably cheaper and not backlogged\"\n- This could cost Nvidia data center real estate and put a \"serious dent\" in its GPU pricing power and gross margin\n\n## Nvidia's Strengths (Context):\n\n- Superior AI hardware (H100, Blackwell, Blackwell Ultra GPUs)\n- Aggressive innovation timeline bringing new advanced chips to market annually\n- CUDA software platform keeps customers loyal\n- Strategic partnerships including with OpenAI (deploying at least 10 gigawatts of AI data centers using Nvidia GPUs)\n- Next-generation chip \"Vera Rubin\" will require far fewer GPUs to train LLMs\n\n## Opinion Attribution:\n\n**Named Source:** The Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team identified 10 best stocks to buy, and \"Nvidia wasn't one of them\" (as of January 14, 2026)\n\n**Article's Conclusion (less reliable - opinion piece):** \"While AI has the potential to be a long-term game changer, the short-term risks currently outweigh the rewards. If one or more of these predominantly historical headwinds take shape in the new year, Nvidia stock could fall below $100.\"\n\n**Note:** This is an opinion piece from The Motley Fool, which has a commercial interest in promoting its Stock Advisor service.

Critics question the return on investment from massive AI spending, citing projected expenditures of $200 billion by Amazon, $180 billion by Alphabet, and $125 billion by Meta Platforms in 2026. These figures raise fears that the AI boom may collapse, negatively impacting Nvidia\u2019s stock, which is tied to demand for its GPUs used in AI computing. However, the article argues that these concerns are misguided, as AI hyperscalers are expected to continue massive spending\u2014projected to reach $3 trillion to $4 trillion in global data center capital expenditures by 2030. Nvidia\u2019s 2025 data center capex estimate was $600 billion, already nearing the 2026 totals. The author predicts that Nvidia\u2019s stock will be significantly higher in one year, driven by tangible improvements in AI technology that will fuel further hyperscaler investment and sustained growth beyond 2027.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 12:00 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/02/17/where-will-nvidia-be-in-1-year/)\n\n**Why Is Nvidia Stock Underperforming in 2026?**\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has underperformed in 2026, declining 2% year-to-date despite strong financial results, including accelerating top-line growth and robust guidance for fiscal Q4. The company benefits from massive AI capital expenditure plans by tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms, which are expected to boost Nvidia\u2019s near-term sales. However, investor concerns are mounting due to several factors. First, Amazon\u2019s projected $200 billion AI spending in 2026 far exceeds its trailing-12-month free cash flow of $11.2 billion, signaling potential financial strain and unsustainable euphoria around AI. Second, tech giants are developing in-house AI chips: Amazon\u2019s Trainium2 and Trainium3 chips are already in high demand, with Trainium2 fully subscribed at 1.4 million units, and Anthropic using it to train its AI model, Claude. Amazon CEO Andy Jassy emphasized that reducing AI chip costs is a key priority, suggesting that in-house solutions could undercut Nvidia\u2019s pricing power. Similarly, Alphabet and Microsoft are advancing their own AI chip programs. Third, Nvidia\u2019s valuation remains high, with a current price-to-earnings ratio of 45 and a forward P/E of 24. While the forward P/E suggests growth may justify the current price, investors are wary that if AI spending slows or in-house alternatives gain traction, Nvidia\u2019s margins and pricing power could be threatened. The Motley Fool notes that Nvidia was not included in its top 10 stock picks for 2026, indicating cautious sentiment despite the company\u2019s strong innovation and execution.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 05:06 AM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/why-nvidia-stock-underperforming-2026)\n\n**Why Is Nvidia Stock Underperforming in 2026? | The Motley Fool**\nNvidia (NVDA) stock has underperformed in 2026, declining 2% year-to-date despite strong financial results, including accelerating top-line growth and robust guidance for fiscal Q4. The S&P 500 has remained nearly flat, highlighting Nvidia\u2019s relative weakness. Investors are concerned about the sustainability of the AI boom, particularly due to massive capital expenditures by tech giants like Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, and Meta Platforms\u2014projects that are expected to boost Nvidia\u2019s near-term sales. However, Amazon\u2019s projected $200 billion AI spending, far exceeding its trailing-12-month free cash flow of $11.2 billion, raises concerns about financial feasibility and potential euphoria. Additionally, tech giants are developing in-house AI chips: Amazon\u2019s Trainium2 and Trainium3 are already in high demand, with Trainium2 'fully subscribed' and used by Anthropic to train Claude; Amazon CEO Andy Jassy emphasized the need for better price-performance, signaling a push to reduce reliance on third-party chips. Alphabet and Microsoft are also advancing their own AI chip programs. These developments threaten Nvidia\u2019s pricing power and market dominance. Furthermore, Nvidia\u2019s forward price-to-earnings ratio of 24, while lower than its current P/E of 45, may still reflect overvaluation if growth concerns materialize.

The stock price was USD 182.81, and Nvidia's market capitalization stood at USD 4.5 trillion. Since the end of last month, Nvidia has declined by -2.27%. The 200-day simple moving average is USD 171.68, with a 52-week high of USD 212.19 (recorded on October 29, 2025) and a 52-week low of USD 86.62 (on April 7, 2025). The company remains a key focus ahead of its Q4 earnings report on February 25, with analysts generally bullish, despite growing competition in the AI chip market, particularly from Broadcom, and concerns over market saturation.

Analysts forecast a 71% year-over-year increase in adjusted earnings per share to $1.52, up from $0.89 in the same quarter of the prior year. Revenue is expected to surge to $65.56 billion, a 67% increase from $39.33 billion in the same period last year. The company\u2019s CFO, Colette Kress, revealed visibility for $500 billion in revenue from the Blackwell and Rubin chip platforms between early 2026 and the end of 2026, underscoring NVIDIA\u2019s dominant market position. Investors are particularly focused on delivery timelines for Blackwell and Rubin in fiscal year 2027.

While Nvidia has consistently exceeded Wall Street's consensus estimates in the past four quarters, the article predicts it will face challenges meeting investors' 'lofty expectations' despite strong performance. This is driven by several factors: insatiable demand for Nvidia's AI GPUs\u2014Hopper (H100), Blackwell, and Blackwell Ultra\u2014has enabled premium pricing and GAAP gross margins in the mid-70% range, supported by its CUDA software platform, which locks in developer loyalty. Additionally, Nvidia's competitive edge is reinforced by its aggressive R&D investment and the limited ability of external competitors like Advanced Micro Devices and Broadcom to match its compute capabilities. However, internal threats are emerging: major customers in the 'Magnificent Seven' (e.g., Microsoft, Amazon, Google) are developing their own AI chips, which, while less powerful, are cheaper and not subject to supply shortages. This could lead to a loss of data center market share. Furthermore, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing\u2019s rapid expansion of CoWoS capacity is expected to reduce GPU scarcity, diminishing Nvidia\u2019s pricing power and premium margins over time. The article notes that Nvidia\u2019s historically high price-to-sales (P/S) ratio\u2014briefly exceeding 30 in early November\u2014suggests a potential bubble, and even a strong earnings beat may not justify its current valuation. As a result, the market may exhibit a 'buy the rumor, sell the news' reaction, with the fiscal 2027 outlook posing additional risks to investor sentiment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 12:35 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/02/16/prediction-nvda-difficult-time-expectations-feb-25/)\n\n**Key Focus for S&P 500 on Monday, February 16: U.S. Holiday Market Closure**\nOn Monday, February 16, 2026, the S&P 500 futures rose 0.32% to 6,845 points, following a 0.17% decline in the S&P 500 futures Friday to 6,829 points, while the Nasdaq 100 fell 0.17% to 24,700 points and the Dow Jones dropped 0.04% to 49,458 points. The decline was driven by the 'Magnificent Seven' tech giants: Nvidia (NVDA) -2.21%, Apple (AAPL) -2.27%, Meta (META) -1.54%, Alphabet (GOOG) -1.08%, Amazon (AMZN) -0.41%, Microsoft (MSFT) -0.13%, with only Tesla (TSLA) closing slightly positive at +0.09%. Despite Friday\u2019s inflation data showing a decline in the U.S., investor sentiment remains cautious due to concerns that AI could undermine corporate profitability. The 'Magnificent Seven' are projected to spend $650 billion on AI by 2026, with returns expected to be slow, creating downward pressure. Further concerns arise over potential increased spending in 2027. The payments sector also declined: Visa (V) -3.12%, Mastercard (MA) -1.57%, American Express (AXP) -1.57%, triggered by Visa\u2019s SEC filing linking its stock buyback program to the resolution of a long-standing antitrust case over interbank fees. In contrast, defensive sectors led gains: utilities, construction materials, healthcare, and energy, with Caterpillar (CAT) +2.10% and UnitedHealth Group (UNH) +3.10%. The U.S. market was closed for President\u2019s Day, observed on the third Monday of February, though futures remained active. Corporate news was limited, with Walmart (WMT) reporting Thursday, focusing on consumer demand at the end of 2025 and AI\u2019s impact. A more significant event is Nvidia\u2019s (NVDA) earnings report on February 25. Macroeconomic data in the coming days, including U.S. GDP, PCE inflation, and PMI data for two sectors, will test the narrative of a strong U.S. economy. Geopolitically, a key meeting between the U.S. and Iran is scheduled in Geneva on Tuesday, seen as a final opportunity to avoid conflict. Institutional flows improved: after a $10.3 billion outflow from SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (SPY) three weeks prior, the fund saw a $4.24 billion inflow in the prior week, with the bulk of the increase occurring Friday, suggesting that recent inflation data was favorable to large investors.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:28 AM\nSource:[Investing.com \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f](https://ru.investing.com/analysis/article-200329084)\n\n**3 Predictions for Nvidia in 2026**\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is projected to experience significant growth by 2026, according to analyst Keithen Drury, who outlines three key predictions. First, GPU sales to China could boost Nvidia's annual revenue by up to $50 billion, with the company potentially regaining pre-ban sales levels of around $8 billion in Q2 FY2025, leading to over $30 billion in Chinese revenue if exports resume under a new U.S. government agreement. Second, Nvidia's annual revenue is expected to surpass $350 billion in 2026, exceeding Wall Street's current average forecast of $326 billion for FY2027, driven by surging global AI computing demand and new product launches. Third, Nvidia's stock could cross $300 per share, with a $7.84 trillion market valuation based on $196 billion in projected profits (at a 56% profit margin) and a 40x earnings multiple. At $183 per share in February 2026, the stock has substantial upside if all three predictions materialize. The Motley Fool and analyst Keithen Drury recommend Nvidia as one of the best stocks to own in 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 04:40 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/02/15/3-predictions-for-nvidia-in-2026/)\n\n**Prediction: Nvidia Stock Will Soar to This Price in 2026 as the AI Boom Expands From Data Centers to Robotaxis**\nNvidia (NVDA) shares have risen 1,200% since January 2023, driven by the surge in AI adoption following the viral success of ChatGPT. Wall Street analysts present divergent views: Mark Lipacis of Evercore maintains a bullish target of $352 per share, reflecting 83% upside from the current $192 share price, citing Nvidia\u2019s dominant 85% market share in AI accelerators, full-stack strategy (including GPUs, CPUs, networking, and software), and leadership in both data center AI and physical AI (e.g., autonomous vehicles and robots). Conversely, Jay Goldberg of Seaport Research takes a bearish stance, recommending a sell with a target of $140 per share, or 27% downside, due to rising competition from custom AI chips like Google\u2019s TPUs and Meta\u2019s planned investments, as well as margin pressures from high bandwidth memory (HBM) shortages and Nvidia\u2019s $26 billion cloud capacity commitment over six years. Despite these concerns, the author predicts Nvidia stock will reach $260 per share by December 2026\u2014a 35% increase from $192\u2014justifying this midpoint estimate between the bullish and bearish extremes. The prediction is supported by Goldman Sachs\u2019 observation that AI capital expenditures have consistently been underestimated, suggesting upside potential, and by Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang\u2019s emphasis on autonomous machines as the next AI frontier, with increasing robotaxi deployments by Waymo and Tesla expected to boost Nvidia\u2019s relevance and valuation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 08:35 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/01/31/nvidia-stock-will-soar-this-price-2026-ai-boom/)\n\n**This Is Nvidia's Price Prediction Heading Into 2016 According To This Market**\nNvidia (NVDA) has surged 1,000% since late 2022, driven by the AI boom, with its stock peaking at $212 per share in October 2025 before settling into a sideways range between $170 and $180. The company reported record fiscal Q3 revenue of $57 billion and $500 billion in AI chip orders through 2026. However, investor sentiment has cooled, with the stock down 16% from its October highs amid market rotation out of tech and concerns over valuation. According to Polymarket, a decentralized prediction platform, there is a 71% probability Nvidia will reach $190 by December 31, 2026, an 84% chance of hitting $185, and a 43% chance of reaching $200. Downside risks are limited: only a 44% chance of falling to $165 and a 32% chance of dropping to $160. Extreme moves\u2014such as a $260 upside or $125 downside\u2014are each priced at less than 5%, indicating market consensus that Nvidia will remain near its current $180 trading range through year-end, with minimal conviction for a breakout. Additionally, Alphabet secured a multi-billion-dollar deal with Meta Platforms to integrate TPUs starting in 2027, signaling a potential long-term challenge to Nvidia\u2019s market dominance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 03:37 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

He emphasized that despite aggressive efforts by hyperscalers like Google (GOOG, GOOGL) and Meta (META) to develop their own silicon, Nvidia remains the undisputed 'Godfather of AI.' Ives highlighted a 12-to-1 supply-demand imbalance for Nvidia chips, with inventory reportedly sold out through 2026, stating that doubting Nvidia\u2019s dominance is 'the wrong move.' He projected the current tech bull market will extend into 2026, likening the AI-driven rally to a party that started at 9 p.m. and is now only at 10:30 p.m., with festivities expected to continue until 4 a.m. Ives advised investors to prepare for the S&P 500 to reach 7,000. Beyond Nvidia (NVDA), he identified Palantir (PLTR) as a potential $1 trillion market cap company within two to three years, and recommended Microsoft (MSFT), Oracle (ORCL), and CrowdStrike (CRWD) as core holdings. On consumer tech, he maintained a bullish stance on Tesla (TSLA), setting an $800 price target based on a potential $1 trillion valuation for its autonomous driving business, and predicted a consumer AI revolution led by Apple (AAPL), forecasting an iPhone 17 supercycle. NVDA has risen 30.33% year-to-date, outperforming the Nasdaq 100\u2019s 20.32% return, and closed at $180.26, up 1.37% on the day. Despite strong long-term price trends, NVDA has a weak short- and medium-term trend and poor value ranking per Benzinga\u2019s Edge Stock Rankings.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 06:58 AM\nSource:[Benzinga](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/25/11/49109212/dan-ives-says-it-is-nvidias-world-and-everyone-else-is-paying-rent-predicts-massive-tech-rally-into-2026)\n\n**Nvidia Stock 2026 Prediction: Can NVDA's Gravity-Defying Rally Continue?**\nNvidia (NVDA) has achieved a year-to-date (YTD) gain of approximately 40% as of November 8, 2025, placing it among the top 50 gainers in the S&P 500 Index ($SPX). This follows 171% gains in 2024 and 239% in 2023, fueling a gravity-defying rally that pushed Nvidia\u2019s market capitalization to $5 trillion\u2014the first company to reach this milestone. Earlier in 2025, it had also become the first company to exceed $4 trillion in market cap. According to Loop Capital analyst Ananda Baruah, Nvidia could reach an $8.5 trillion market cap within a year, with a $350 target price\u2014higher than the average sell-side analyst estimate of $234.51. The AI boom is cited as a key driver, with hyperscalers like Meta Platforms (META), Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOG) (GOOGL), and Amazon (AMZN) increasing their capital expenditures (capex) for AI infrastructure. Despite some signs of tech firms exploring alternative chips, Nvidia\u2019s CUDA computing platform remains the de facto standard for AI development, creating significant user lock-in. Microsoft, which previously projected lower capex growth for fiscal year 2026 (ending June 30, 2026), now expects higher spending, while Meta has repeatedly raised its 2025 capex guidance and anticipates notable increases in 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 08, 2025 02:12 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

This growth is driven by AI and cloud computing, with Nvidia's earnings soaring from a few billion to $86.6 billion in trailing-12-month net income. The company is expected to report fiscal Q3 2026 earnings on Nov. 19, with analyst consensus forecasting $4.51 and $6.43 in earnings per share for fiscal 2026 and 2027, respectively. At a current stock price of $184.44, Nvidia\u2019s projected P/E ratio for 2027 is 28.7, which is reasonable; a 40 P/E would imply a stock price of $257.20 and a market cap of $6.22 trillion. Microsoft, with a $3.82 trillion market cap, is also positioned to reach $5 trillion with a 32% increase from its current price, driven by strong earnings growth from Azure, AI integration across Microsoft 365, Dynamics, GitHub, LinkedIn, and its $69 billion Activision-Blizzard acquisition. The 'Ten Titans' \u2014 Nvidia, Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, Broadcom, Meta Platforms, Tesla, Oracle, and Netflix \u2014 collectively make up 39% of the S&P 500 and have delivered strong returns. Despite elevated valuations, both Nvidia and Microsoft are seen as resilient due to high margins, strong balance sheets, and cash reserves, enabling them to withstand economic downturns or competitive pressures. The Motley Fool recommends focusing on quality companies and highlights these two as long-term growth leaders, with options strategies suggested for Microsoft. The article concludes that investors should evaluate companies based on their ability to meet expectations rather than price alone.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 04:20 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/27/prediction-nvidia-will-form-the-5-trillion-club-be/?source=newstex&utm_source=newstex&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=dd2fe63e-58bc-42ed-bbc4-386e386dd5f8)\n\n**Prediction: Nvidia Stock Is Going to Soar After Nov. 19**\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) is predicted to see its stock soar after the release of its fiscal 2026 third-quarter results on November 19, 2025. The company, the world's leading supplier of AI chips for data centers, is expected to report revenue of approximately $54 billion\u2014a 54% year-over-year increase\u2014with the data center segment accounting for nearly 90% of that. Wall Street consensus estimates call for earnings of $1.24 per share, a 53% increase from the prior year. Nvidia\u2019s latest Blackwell Ultra GB300 GPUs, which deliver up to 50 times more performance than the H100 chips, are in high demand due to the rising computational needs of advanced AI reasoning models from companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and Meta Platforms. The upcoming Rubin GPU architecture, rumored to be 3.3 times more powerful than Blackwell Ultra, could further solidify Nvidia\u2019s dominance in the projected $4 trillion in data center infrastructure spending between now and 2030. Despite trading near a record high, Nvidia\u2019s current price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 51.9 is 15% below its 10-year average of 60.9, suggesting potential undervaluation. If earnings meet or exceed expectations, the P/E ratio could appear even more attractive, with forward P/E ratios of 40.5 for fiscal 2026 and 28.6 for fiscal 2027. Analysts predict Nvidia stock could need to rise 113% over the next 12 to 18 months to return to its 10-year average P/E, indicating strong upside potential. The November 19 conference call, featuring CEO Jensen Huang, may also provide forward guidance, with Wall Street expecting fourth-quarter revenue of $61.1 billion\u2014any upward revision could act as a bullish catalyst. The article concludes that as long as Nvidia continues to meet or exceed expectations, the market will continue pricing in its future potential.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 17, 2025 08:40 AM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2025/10/17/prediction-nvidia-stock-going-to-soar-after-nov-19/?source=newstex&utm_source=newstex&utm_medium=feed&utm_campaign=article&referring_guid=476586aa-18b4-49d5-9778-1cd11f19d638)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
