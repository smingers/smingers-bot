source=\"https://manifold.markets/WalterMartin/acx-2026-will-nvidias-stock-price-c\">\n## Summary of Manifold Market Article\n\nThis article describes a prediction market on Manifold regarding the same Nvidia stock price question that exists on Metaculus.\n\n**Key Information:**\n\n1. **Market Details:**\n   - Current probability on Manifold: 15% chance that Nvidia's stock will close below $100 on any day in 2026\n   - The market has 1,000 \u1e40 (Manifold currency) in liquidity\n   - The market explicitly states it \"Resolves according to Metaculus resolution\"\n\n2. **Resolution Criteria:**\n   - Mirrors the Metaculus question: Will resolve as Yes if Nvidia stock's close price is less than $100.00 for any regular trading day during 2026, according to Yahoo Finance\n   - Alternative credible sources may be used if Yahoo Finance is unavailable or inaccurate\n   - The question is managed and resolved by Manifold\n\n3. **Related Market Sentiment (from \"People are also trading\" section):**\n   - 82% chance Nvidia share price will be higher at end of 2028 than at end of 2025\n   - 55% chance Nvidia's stock price will be higher on March 17, 2026 than on February 20,

2024 closing price within five years\n\n**Note:** This is a prediction market platform (Manifold) rather than a traditional news article, so the information represents crowd-sourced betting odds rather than expert analysis or reporting.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://entropicthoughts.com/nvidia-stock-crash-prediction\">\n# Summary of \"Entropic Thoughts\" Article on Nvidia Stock Crash Prediction\n\n**Source Information:**\n- Content source: Entropicthoughts\n- Date: January 20, 2026\n- Author: kqr\n\n**Key Facts and Analysis:**\n\n1. **Current Market Context (as of article date):**\n   - Nvidia stock trading at approximately $184\n   - A drop to $100 would represent nearly a 50% decline in value\n   - Nvidia is described as \"the highest valued company in the world\"\n\n2. **Author's Prediction:**\n   - The author's best prediction is approximately **10% probability** that Nvidia will close below $100 on any day in 2026\n   - The author notes they \"didn't expect to get such a high answer\"\n\n3. **Technical Analysis Approach:**\n   - The author uses options pricing and implied volatility to estimate the probability\n   - Signal-to-noise ratio for Nvidia stock using 2025 return data: **-1.4 dB**\n   - This indicates movement is still dominated by noise, but expected return matters more than in shorter timeframes\n   - For comparison, a previous Dow Jones prediction had a signal-to-noise ratio of -8 dB\n\n4. **Volatility Considerations:**\n   - Using a simple random walk model gives \"near-zero percent chance\" of closing under $100\n   - However, the same model shows 23% probability of dropping to $130\n   - The author argues volatility is not constant over a year, making simple models inadequate\n   - If the stock drops to $130, it suggests a higher-volatility market environment where further drops become more plausible\n\n5. **Options Market Data:**\n   - December 2026 Nvidia call option with $100 strike price costs **$92.90**\n   - Current intrinsic value would be $84 ($184 stock price - $100 strike)\n   - The premium suggests market expects potential for better exercise opportunities before expiration\n\n6. **Methodology:**\n   - The author uses a binomial asset price model with daily time steps\n   - Uses geometric binomial walk where stock can grow by factor e^\u03c3 or shrink by e^(-\u03c3) each day\n   - Analyzes options pricing to reverse-engineer implied volatility estimates\n\n**Note:** The article appears to be incomplete in the provided excerpt, cutting off mid-explanation of the binomial pricing model.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://ts2.tech/en/nvidia-stock-slips-in-premarket-as-cpi-test-looms-and-traders-eye-feb-25-earnings/\">\n# Summary: Nvidia stock slips in premarket as

Summary: Goldman Sachs revamps Nvidia stock forecast ahead of earnings\n\n**Source:** Yahoo Finance  \n**Date:** February 8, 2026  \n**Author:** Todd Campbell\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- **Earnings Date:** Nvidia's quarterly earnings results are scheduled for February 25, 2026\n- **Goldman Sachs Revenue Forecast:** Expects fiscal Q4 revenue of $67.3 billion, approximately $2 billion above Street estimates\n- **Goldman Sachs Position vs. Street:** 8% above consensus for Q1 revenue; 5% above for Q4 EPS and 9% above for Q1 EPS\n- **Stock Performance:** Nvidia shares have fallen 13% from their peak last fall (as of article date)\n- **Price Target:** Goldman Sachs maintains a $250 stock price target, which is 35% above the February 6 closing price\n\n## Key Analyst Opinions (Goldman Sachs):\n\n**Concerns:**\n- \"We believe upside to Nvidia's CY 26 estimates is largely priced into the stock at current levels, and stock price outperformance will hinge on revenue visibility into CY 27\"\n- Investors may have already priced in a strong quarterly result, shifting focus to guidance for 2026 and 2027\n\n**Positive Catalysts Identified:**\n\n1. **Hyperscaler spending:** Goldman Sachs projects data center capex above $527 billion (up from $394 billion in 2025). Notes this appears conservative given Amazon's $200 billion and Alphabet's $185 billion spending announcements\n\n2. **Datacenter guidance:** Nvidia has modeled $500 billion in datacenter revenue through 2026; Goldman Sachs is \"well above the Street\" estimates\n\n3. **Non-hyperscaler demand:** Potential ramp in GPU demand from LLM companies like OpenAI and Anthropic; OpenAI ramping later in 2026\n\n4. **China demand:** China previously accounted for over 20% of Nvidia's revenue, now less than half that due to restrictions. U.S. has greenlit sales of H200 chips to China, and Chinese officials have removed roadblocks\n\n5. **Rubin chip ramp:** Nvidia is replacing Blackwell with the faster Rubin chip, which is in production with expected ramp in 2026\n\n## Competitive Context:\n\n- Mounting competition from AMD and Broadcom mentioned\n- AMD MI455X noted as \"more competitive\"\n- Hyperscalers partnering with Broadcom and Marvell Tech to develop ASIC chips for specific AI tasks\n\n## Author Background Note:\nThe author discloses owning Nvidia stock since 2017.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/02/stock-market-today-live-updates.html\">\n# Article Summary: S&P 500 tumbles nearly 1% as investors rotate out of tech\n\n**Source:** CNBC  \n**Date:** February 02, 2026  \n**Authors:** Liz Napolitano, Sean Conlon, Pia Singh\n\n## Key Market Movements\n\n- **S&P 500:** Fell 0.84% to close at 6,917.81\n- **Dow Jones Industrial Average:** Dropped 166.67 points (0.34%) to 49,240.99 (earlier touched a new record at 49,653.13)\n- **Nasdaq Composite:** Shed 1.43% to settle at 23,255.19\n\n## Technology Sector Performance\n\n- **Nvidia:** Slumped nearly 3%, adding to its losses for the year\n- **Other \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks:** Microsoft and Meta Platforms both down more than 2%; Apple marginally lower\n- **Software stocks:** Continued 2026 tumble with ServiceNow and Salesforce falling close to 7% each\n- **iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF:** Down another 5% on Tuesday, now down about 28% from recent high and off roughly 17% year-to-date\n\n## Expert Commentary\n\n**Josh Brown, CEO of Ritholtz Wealth Management:**\n- \"I think we have one or two of these periods every year. The cause is always different, but the effect is always the same. Some of the most popular trades of the previous uptrend just get absolutely nuked.\"\n- \"It tells you risk appetite is coming out of anything that has to do with technology.\"\n\n**Bill Northey, U.S. Bank Asset Management Group senior investment director:**\n- \"Revenue trends look incredibly solid, but at the margin, there continues to be some concerns emanating around the software space, in particular, related to the potential disintermediation that can occur from artificial intelligence. I think that's a story that is still yet to be written, but ultimately, we're seeing that reflected in sentiment at this point in time.\"\n\n## Other Notable Movements\n\n- **Bitcoin:** Fell more than 5%, reaching 73,844.67 - its lowest level since November 6, 2024. Down about 15% year-to-date\n- **Walmart:** Gained about 3% and surpassed $1 trillion market capitalization\n- **PepsiCo:** Advanced almost 5% after strong earnings report\n- **Private credit stocks:** Blue Owl, TPG, Ares Management, and KKR all down by double-digit percentages on fears about exposure to AI-disrupted industries\n\n## AI and Employment Context\n\n**Ken Griffin, Citadel CEO (at Wall Street Journal event):**\n- Suggested AI may be used as an excuse for job cuts rather than actual productivity gains\n- \"AI has gotten a lot of very negative headlines in terms of being the excuse that companies have used to trim their workforces down. But, objectively, I think very few businesses are actually seeing productivity gains that come anywhere close to the headline of job losses that we have seen.\"\n- Job cuts were more than 50% higher in 2025 than 2024, according to Challenger, Gray & Christmas\n\n**Note:** The article appears to be cut off at the end, so the final paragraph about the WisdomTree Cloud Computing Fund is incomplete.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide the time-series data for the community prediction on Metaculus question 40972 since launch and list major Nvidia-related news events (downgrades, earnings, export controls) from Dec 2025 to Feb 2026 that might affect the forecast.\n1.

Nvidia-related events that are likely to have influenced forecasts between 01 Dec 2025 and 16 Feb 2026  \n\nChronological list (all dates 2025-2026):\n\n\u2022 05 Dec 2025 \u2013 U.S. Commerce Department confirms that the previously announced licence framework (\u201c15 % revenue-share for H20 exports to China\u201d) will be extended to the newer H200 GPU at a 25 % rate, making revenue sharing a pre-condition for export licences (Lawfare, 14 Jan 2026, which quotes Trump\u2019s December remarks).  \nImpact: reinforced political risk around Nvidia\u2019s China revenue and margin.\n\n\u2022 08 Dec 2025 \u2013 \u201cMonday\u2019s biggest analyst calls\u201d (CNBC, 08 Dec 2025) listed Nvidia among the day\u2019s focus stocks; although the note itself was not a downgrade, the item highlighted that some large brokerages were reviewing semiconductor valuations. The mention coincided with a one-day 3 % pull-back in NVDA.  \nImpact: short-term downward pressure; possibly nudged forecasters to raise probability of a sub-$100 print.\n\n\u2022 22 Dec 2025 \u2013 24/7 Wall St. reports Nvidia \u201cplans to begin shipments of its H200 AI chip to China in February 2026\u201d with initial orders of 40 k-80 k units worth up to US $3.2 bn (24/7 Wall St., 22 Dec 2025).  \nImpact: positive demand signal; likely lowered perceived crash risk.\n\n\u2022 14 Jan 2026 \u2013 U.S. Presidential Proclamation imposes a 25 % tariff on H200-class chips entering the United States en-route to China, effectively taxing Nvidia\u2019s China shipments; the move is criticised as illegal under ECRA (Lawfare, 14 Jan 2026).  \nImpact: introduces new cost drag and policy uncertainty; bearish.\n\n\u2022 16 Jan 2026 \u2013 BIS final rule shifts export-licence review for H200/MI325-class chips from \u201cpresumption of denial\u201d to strict \u201ccase-by-case\u201d approval if supply guarantees are met (Morgan Lewis, 16 Jan 2026).  \nImpact: slightly offsets the 14 Jan shock, but requirements (50 % of supply must remain in U.S., detailed certification) still cap upside.\n\n\u2022 17 Jan 2026 \u2013 Chinese customs begin blocking H200 shipments that the U.S. had cleared, pausing suppliers\u2019 production (Guardian, 17 Jan 2026).  \nImpact: material threat to FY-2026 China revenue; increases probability of earnings disappointment and hence of a large price decline.\n\n\u2022 03 Feb 2026 \u2013 (No major event surfaced in the present search; see \u201cinformation gaps\u201d below.)\n\n\u2022 16-17 Feb 2026 \u2013 Multiple Motley Fool features debate Nvidia\u2019s under-performance YTD and preview Q4-FY26 earnings set for release on 25 Feb 2026 (Motley Fool, 17 Feb 2026; Motley Fool, 17 Feb 2026).  \nImpact: neutral to mildly bearish tone; earnings anticipation traditionally raises volatility.\n\nMajor categories covered:  \n\u2022 Export-control policy shifts: 05 Dec 2025 revenue-share signal, 14 Jan 2026 25 % tariff, 16 Jan 2026 BIS rule, 17 Jan 2026 Chinese block.  \n\u2022 Demand/earnings news: 22 Dec 2025 China H200 order leak; 25 Feb 2026 upcoming Q4 report.  \n\u2022 Analyst sentiment: 08 Dec 2025 \u201cbiggest calls\u201d roundup.  \n\n3. Remaining information gaps  \n\u2022 Exact prediction_timeseries values (date\u2013probability pairs) for Metaculus question 40972.  \n\u2022 Any Nvidia-specific analyst downgrade dated explicitly after 01 Dec 2025 (none surfaced; the CNBC item lists \u201cbiggest calls\u201d but details are thin).  \n\u2022 A complete list of earnings-related corporate disclosures between 01 Dec 2025 and 16 Feb 2026 (e.g., preliminary Q4 sales figures or conference-presentation comments) did not appear in the current sources.\n\nWithout the missing time-series data the quantitative portion of the original query cannot yet be delivered. All qualitative event information requested has been assembled above.</Agent_report>\n"
