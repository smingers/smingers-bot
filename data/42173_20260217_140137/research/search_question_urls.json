I probably know they're trying to, so that's different.\"\n\n**Sid Sheth (D-Matrix co-founder):**\n- \"Nvidia would love to have 100% of it, but customers would not love for Nvidia to have 100% of it. It's just too big of an opportunity. It would be too unhealthy if any one company took all of it.\"\n\n**Fernando Vidal (3 Fourteen Research co-founder):**\n- \"Nobody can deny that today Nvidia is the hardware you want to train and run AI models. But there's been incremental progress in leveling the playing field, from hyperscalers working on their own chips, to even little startups, designing their own silicon.\"\n\n**Lisa Su (AMD CEO):**\n- \"The key is that there are a lot of options there. I think we're going to see a situation where there's not only one solution, there will be multiple solutions.\"\n\n**Andrew Feldman (Cerebras Systems CEO):**\n- \"There's ample competition and I think that's healthy for the ecosystem.\"\n\n## Competition Details:\n\n**AMD:**\n- Flagship chip: Instinct MI300X\n- Microsoft using AMD processors through Azure cloud\n- Morgan Stanley analysts project

over 40% of Nvidia's revenue\n- All building processors for internal use\n- Amazon introduced Inferentia chips in 2018 and Tranium in 2021\n- Google using Tensor Processing Units (TPUs) since 2015; announced sixth version (Trillium) in May 2024\n- Microsoft building Maia and Cobalt chips\n- Meta developing homegrown chips for \"greater efficiency\" compared to GPUs\n\n**Startups:**\n- D-Matrix: Founded 2019, raised $110 million in September (2023), plans to release semiconductor card later in 2024\n- Cerebras Systems: Founded 2015, valued at $4 billion during most recent fundraising\n\n**Venture Capital:**\n- $6 billion invested in AI semiconductor companies in 2023, up from $5.7 billion in 2022\n\n**JPMorgan Analysis:**\n- Market for building custom chips for big cloud providers could be worth as much as $30 billion with potential growth of 20% per year\n\n## Strategic Developments:\n\n- Nvidia committed to releasing new AI chip architecture every year (versus every other year historically)\n- Industry group UXL foundation (including AMD, Intel, Google) working to create free alternatives to Nvidia's CUDA software\n- Shift from training AI models to \"inference\" (deploying models) could give competitors opportunities\n- Movement toward \"small models\" running on devices (laptops, PCs, phones) rather than data centers\n- Apple and Qualcomm updating chips with specialized neural processors for AI\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/big-techs-spending-drove-nvidias-rise-154027146.html\">\n# Summary of \"Big Tech's spending drove Nvidia's rise\"\n\n**Source:** Yahoo Finance  \n**Date:** May 24, 2025  \n**Author:** Laura Bratton\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n### Big Tech as Nvidia's Major Customers:\n- **Microsoft (MSFT)** is Nvidia's largest revenue driver\n  - Spends approximately 47% of its capital expenditures directly on Nvidia chips\n  - Accounts for nearly 19% of Nvidia's revenue on an annualized basis (as of Nvidia's fiscal Q4 2025, ending Jan. 26, 2025)\n  \n- **Meta (META)**\n  - Spends 25% of its capital expenditures on Nvidia\n  - Accounts for just over 9% of Nvidia's annual revenue\n\n- **Amazon (AMZN)** and **Alphabet/Google (GOOG)** are also among the top customers (ranked 3rd and 4th respectively)\n\n- **Tesla (TSLA)** is Nvidia's 15th largest customer\n\n### Indirect Spending:\n- Microsoft also rents data center capacity from CoreWeave (CRWV), which itself spends billions on Nvidia chips\n- Microsoft accounted for 72% of CoreWeave's revenue in the company's most recent fiscal quarter\n\n### Overall Spending:\n- Meta, Microsoft, Amazon, and Google are projected to spend over $330 billion cumulatively in 2025, driven by AI investments\n\n### Historical Context:\n- Three years ago (based on Nvidia's 2022 Q4 earnings), Microsoft spent less than 1% of its capital expenditures on Nvidia chips and accounted for less than 1% of Nvidia's revenue\n\n## Expert Opinion (Named Source):\n\n**Gil Luria, DA Davidson analyst:**\n- \"We believe NVIDIA is reliant on a handful of large technology companies for about half their revenue\"\n- Notes that this revenue portion \"has gone up dramatically the last couple of years but appears to be moderating its growth\"\n- Warns: \"This spend may further slow down as these customers increasingly use the chips they developed in-house\"\n- States that while Nvidia chips have \"a very large advantage on AI pre-training,\" custom chips offer \"much more competitive\" cost performance\n\n## Competitive Concerns:\n- Microsoft, Meta, Google, and Amazon have all developed their own custom AI chips tailored to their specific workloads\n- Rival chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO) is developing custom AI chips for customers\n- Nvidia's GPUs are designed for general-purpose AI computing, while custom chips can be more efficient for specific needs\n\n**Data Source Note:** Bloomberg compiled the statistics from publicly available documents including company financial reports, presentations, and news stories, with adjustments made on an annualized basis for comparison.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2024/11/20/nvidia-nvda-earnings-report-q3-2025.html\">\n# Summary of Nvidia Q3 2024 Earnings Report\n\n**Source:** CNBC,
