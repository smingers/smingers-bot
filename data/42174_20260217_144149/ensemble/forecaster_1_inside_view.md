- **Expert Opinion:** None provided, purely data.

**News Articles - Relevant:**

1. **BrokerTec US Repo Article (Jan 7, 2026):**
   - Quality: Moderate - Industry publication with named sources
   - Factual: US repo ADNV $386B in Dec 2025, up 13% YoY; money market funds at record $7.7T
   - Expert Opinion: Erik Norland (CME Chief Economist) notes yield curve steepening with Fed easing pulling shorter-term yields lower

2. **Year-End Repo Stress Article (Jan 2, 2026):**
   - Quality: High - Describes actual past event
   - Factual: Record $74.6B borrowed via SRF on Dec 31, 2025; SOFR averaged 3.86% that day, some transactions at 4%
   - Relevance: Shows SOFR can spike during stress but this was temporary year-end effect. Feb 26 has no such calendar pressure.

3. **Money Market Funding Pressure Articles (Dec 2025):**
   - Quality: Moderate - Multiple sources (TD Securities, Deutsche Bank, J.P. Morgan)
   - Factual: SOFR and Tri-Party GC Rate rose above 4% in early December, signaling tighter liquidity
   - Expert Opinion: Sam Zief (JPM) notes liquidity no longer "ample"; TD Securities warns reserves "scratching surface of ample"
   - Relevance: Suggests potential for Fed intervention, but by Feb 13 SOFR had normalized to 3.66%

4. **October 2025 SOFR Spike:**
   - Quality: High - Documented historical event
   - Factual: SOFR surged to 4.22% on Oct 31, 2025 (largest single-day rise since 2023)
   - Relevance: Demonstrates SOFR can spike but normalizes quickly; by early Nov it returned to 3.88-3.91%

5. **Mortgage/ARM Rate Articles:**
   - Quality: Low relevance - These discuss products tied to SOFR but don't forecast SOFR itself
   - No predictive value for Feb 26 SOFR

**News Articles - Irrelevant:**
- ECB policy, Philippine peso, cryptocurrency, Spanish mortgages, Saudi stock financing - no bearing on US SOFR

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **FRED Daily Data (Multiple observations):** SOFR extremely stable at 3.64-3.66% for past 2 weeks (Feb 1-13). This is the most direct and reliable evidence. Historical pattern shows 9-day moves typically <10bp during stable policy periods.
- **Fed Policy Stability:** No FOMC meetings until March 17-18, federal funds target unchanged at 3.50%-3.75%. This institutional factor strongly supports continued stability.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Liquidity Normalization:** December funding stress has resolved - SOFR returned from 3.86% (Dec 31) to 3.66% (Feb 13). Tri-Party rates also normalized by early November. This suggests improved market functioning.
- **Repo Market Health:** BrokerTec volumes at record levels with healthy functioning (Erik Norland, CME). Money market fund assets at $7.7T provide ample cash supply.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Potential Fed Intervention:** TD Securities/Deutsche Bank warnings about reserves being at "ample" threshold could lead to Fed bill purchases, but this is speculative and hasn't materialized by Feb 13.
- **Historical Volatility Episodes:** Oct 31 and Dec 31 spikes show SOFR can move sharply, but these were calendar-driven events not applicable to Feb 26.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 9 business days (Feb 14-26, 2026)

**Current Trajectory:** SOFR has been remarkably stable, moving only 1-2bp over the past 10 business days. If this trend continues, SOFR would remain at 3.65-3.67%.

**If Timeframe Halved (4-5 days):** Would increase confidence in stability - extremely unlikely to see significant moves over such a short period. Would narrow distribution to 3.63-3.69% (10th-90th percentile).

**If Timeframe Doubled (18 days):** Would increase uncertainty - more time for unexpected events, technical factors, or market stress. Would widen distribution to approximately 3.55-3.78% (10th-90th percentile) to account for potential month-end effects (early March) and increased probability of surprises.

## (d) Justification

**Factors Supporting Minimal Shift from Outside View:**

1. **Policy Stability (Strong):** No FOMC meetings and explicit Fed guidance maintaining 3.50%-3.75% target. This is the strongest anchor for SOFR.

2. **Recent Stability (Strong):** 3.64-3.66% range for 2 weeks with no signs of stress. The Dec 31 spike has fully reversed.

3. **No Calendar Effects (Strong):** Feb 26 is mid-month, mid-week with no known technical pressures.

4. **Market Functioning (Moderate):** Repo volumes healthy, money market fund assets at records, liquidity concerns from December have not materialized into sustained pressure.

**Factors Supporting Slight Downward Bias:**
- Liquidity appears to have improved from December stress
- SOFR trending at lower end of recent range (3.66% vs 3.75% in early December)

**Factors Supporting Upward Risk:**
- Warnings about reserves approaching "ample" threshold could cause temporary spikes
- Historical precedent of unexpected volatility (Oct 31, Dec 31)

**Distribution Shift from Outside View:**
The outside view predicted 10th-90th percentile of 3.60-3.73%. Given:
- Very recent stability at 3.64-3.66%
- No new stress signals since Feb 13
- Absence of calendar pressures

I will make a **modest adjustment** toward the current level while maintaining similar width to account for unknown unknowns. The current evidence doesn't warrant a dramatic narrowing (that would be overconfident) but does support centering more tightly around 3.65-3.66%.

## Distribution Calibration

**Status Quo Outcome:** 3.66% (last observation)

**If Current Trend Continues:** SOFR remains 3.64-3.67% with high probability.

**Calibration Reasoning:**

Starting from outside view (3.60-3.73 for 10th-90th), I adjust:

- **Central tendency:** Tighten around 3.65-3.66% given recent stability
- **10th percentile (3.61%):** Allow for scenario where liquidity improves further or technical factors push SOFR down 5bp. This is plausible given December showed SOFR can drop from 3.75% to 3.62% over 2 weeks.
- **20th percentile (3.63%):** Modest downward move of 3bp from current level
- **40th percentile (3.65%):** Slight decline from current 3.66%, reflecting most likely scenario of continued stability with minor drift
- **60th percentile (3.67%):** Slight uptick of 1bp, status quo plus minor noise
- **80th percentile (3.70%):** Modest rise of 4bp, capturing scenario of mild technical tightness
- **90th percentile (3.74%):** Captures scenario of unexpected stress similar to early December levels, though less severe than Oct 31 spike (4.22%)

**Testing ±10% shifts:**
- Shifting down 10% (e.g., 10th to 3.55%, 90th to 3.67%) would imply significant easing - not supported by evidence
- Shifting up 10% (e.g., 10th to 3.67%, 90th to 3.81%) would imply high stress probability - contradicts recent stability

My distribution balances recent stability with historical volatility precedents.

## Checklist:

1. **Target Variable:** SOFR value on Feb 26, 2026, in percent, 9 business days from Feb 13 observation of 3.66%.

2. **Outside View Base Rate:** 10th-90th: 3.60-3.73%, centered on 3.66%. My final prediction maintains similar width but adjusts slightly toward recent stability.

3. **Consistency Check:** Implied median ≈ 3.66%; mean ≈ 3.66%. This aligns with status quo and recent stability justification.

4. **Three Most Significant Pieces of Evidence:**
   - SOFR at 3.64-3.66% for past 2 weeks with no volatility (FRED data - factual)
   - No FOMC meetings until March 17-18, policy stable at 3.50%-3.75% (Fed announcement - factual)
   - December funding stress resolved, no current signs of market pressure (SOFR normalized from 3.86% to 3.66% - factual)

5. **Blind-spot Scenario:** Unexpected repo market stress (similar to Oct 31 or Dec 31) could push SOFR to 4.0%+, making forecast look too narrow. This would push outcome UP. Probability: Low (~5%) given no calendar pressures.

6. **Status Quo:** Current value 3.66%. Given 9-day timeframe and stable environment, strong gravitational pull toward status quo. My distribution appropriately centers near this level.

7. **Technicalities:** Values strictly increasing, units in percent, all within bounds (3.094-5.09542).
