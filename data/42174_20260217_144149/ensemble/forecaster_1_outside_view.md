Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**FRED SOFR Series Information (multiple sources):**
- Quality: Primary, authoritative source - Federal Reserve Bank of New York via FRED
- Date: Current through 2026-02-13
- Content: Provides daily SOFR values. Latest observation is 3.66% on Feb 13, 2026. Historical data shows recent range of 3.63-3.69% in past month.
- Factual: All data points are factual observations from the official source.

**Agent Report on SOFR Daily Values:**
- Quality: High - synthesizes official FRED data with Federal Reserve policy information
- Date: Current through Feb 16, 2026
- Key Facts:
  - Complete daily SOFR history from Dec 2025 through Feb 13, 2026
  - No FOMC meetings scheduled between now and Feb 26, 2026 (next meeting March 17-18)
  - Federal funds target range held at 3.50%-3.75% since Dec 10, 2025, reaffirmed Jan 28, 2026
  - SOFR has ranged 3.62-3.75% from Dec 1, 2025 to Feb 13, 2026
- Factual: All information is verifiable from Federal Reserve sources.

**Other Sources (India economy, software industry, Take-Two stock):**
- Quality: Irrelevant to SOFR forecasting
- These contain no information about US interest rates or SOFR.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **SOFR daily changes over 9 business days (Feb 14-26, 2026):**
   - Most suitable for this short-term forecast
   - SOFR is highly stable day-to-day, typically moving 0-3 basis points
   - Recent data shows daily changes rarely exceed ±5 basis points

2. **SOFR behavior during stable policy periods:**
   - Highly relevant - no FOMC meetings between now and target date
   - When Fed policy is unchanged, SOFR tends to trade in tight ranges around the bottom of the federal funds target range

3. **SOFR volatility around month-end/quarter-end:**
   - Less relevant - Feb 26 is not a month-end or quarter-end date
   - These periods show elevated volatility that wouldn't apply here

**Selected Reference Class:** SOFR daily changes over 9 business days during stable policy periods.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 9 business days (Feb 14-26, 2026, assuming typical US business day calendar)

**Historical Patterns:**
- From the provided data (Dec 1, 2025 - Feb 13, 2026):
  - Mean: approximately 3.68%
  - Range: 3.62% - 3.75%
  - Standard deviation: approximately 0.03-0.04%
  - Recent trend (past 2 weeks): stable around 3.65-3.66%

**9-Business-Day Historical Movements:**
- Dec 1 → Dec 12: 3.74% → 3.73% (-1 bp)
- Dec 12 → Dec 26: 3.73% → 3.62% (-11 bp)
- Jan 2 → Jan 15: 3.66% → 3.66% (0 bp)
- Jan 15 → Jan 28: 3.66% → 3.66% (0 bp)
- Jan 28 → Feb 10: 3.66% → 3.65% (-1 bp)

Over 9-business-day periods during stable policy, SOFR typically moves less than ±10 basis points, with most moves under ±5 basis points.

## (d) Justification

**Key Factors Supporting Stability:**

1. **No Policy Changes Expected:** With no FOMC meetings until March 17-18 and the federal funds target range held at 3.50%-3.75%, the policy backdrop is stable.

2. **Recent Stability:** SOFR has been remarkably stable in the 3.63-3.69% range over the past month, with the last 5 observations clustering tightly at 3.64-3.66%.

3. **Technical Relationship:** SOFR typically trades slightly below the federal funds rate (currently 3.50%-3.75% target range). The current level of 3.66% is consistent with this relationship.

4. **No Calendar Effects:** Feb 26 is a mid-week, mid-month date with no known quarter-end, month-end, or holiday effects that would cause volatility.

**Potential Risks:**
- Unexpected market stress or liquidity events
- Unscheduled Fed interventions (very rare)
- Technical factors in repo markets
- However, these are low-probability events over a 9-day horizon

**Base Expectation:** SOFR on Feb 26, 2026 will likely remain very close to the Feb 13 level of 3.66%, probably within ±5 basis points (3.61%-3.71%).

Outside view calibration:

Given the short timeframe (9 business days) and stable policy environment, I expect a tight distribution centered around the current level of 3.66%. However, I must account for:

1. **Historical volatility:** Even in stable periods, SOFR can move 10-15 basis points over 9 days (as seen Dec 12-26).

2. **Unknown unknows:** Market surprises, technical factors, or unexpected news could drive larger moves, though this is unlikely.

3. **Asymmetric risks:** Slight downward bias possible if repo market liquidity improves further, but upward spikes from stress are also possible.

4. **Tails:** The 10th percentile should capture scenarios where SOFR drifts lower (improved liquidity, technical factors). The 90th percentile should capture scenarios where SOFR rises (temporary stress, technical tightness).

Using the recent range (3.62-3.75%) as a guide but allowing for modest extensions:
- Central tendency: 3.64-3.68%
- 10th-90th percentile range: approximately 3.60-3.73%

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.60
Percentile 20: 3.63
Percentile 40: 3.65
Percentile 60: 3.67
Percentile 80: 3.70
Percentile 90: 3.73
