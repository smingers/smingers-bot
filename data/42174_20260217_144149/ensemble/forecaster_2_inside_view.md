Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary/High-Quality Sources:**
- **FRED/New York Fed data (multiple sources)**: Factual, authoritative. Current SOFR = 3.65% as of 12 Feb 2026. Historical range 0.00-5.40%. Daily publication schedule confirmed. These are the definitive primary sources.
- **Agent report**: Comprehensive daily SOFR data from 1 Dec 2025-13 Feb 2026, showing range of 3.62-3.75%, mean 3.66%. FOMC calendar confirms no meeting before 26 Feb. Highly reliable, dated 16 Feb 2026.
- **Trading Economics**: Confirms current SOFR at 3.65%, provides methodology. Factual, no forward predictions.

**Relevant News Articles:**
- **Valor Econômico (2 Jan 2026)**: Reports record $74.6B borrowed via Fed's Standing Repo Facility on 31 Dec 2025, with SOFR averaging 3.86% that day (above Fed's 3.75% upper limit), some transactions at 4%. **Strong evidence** of year-end funding stress, but temporary. Shows SOFR can spike above target range during stress.
- **GuruFocus (6 Nov 2025)**: Reports SOFR declined to 3.91% from 4.0%, spread to IORB narrowed to 1bp. Documents October 2025 volatility resolved. Moderate evidence of recent stability.
- **Yahoo Finance (3 Nov 2025)**: SOFR surged to 4.22% on 31 Oct 2025 (largest single-day rise since 2023, +18bp). Spread to fed funds reached 35bp. Driven by month-end demand overwhelming supply. **Strong evidence** that month-end can cause significant spikes, though analysts expected easing after Fed pauses balance sheet reduction.
- **Financial Post (9 Dec 2025)**: SOFR options markets show skepticism about extended Fed cuts beyond December 2025. Moderate evidence of market expectations for stable rates in early 2026.
- **Morningstar (2 Dec 2025)**: SOFR and Tri-Party rates rose above 4% in early December, signaling tighter liquidity. TD Securities warns reserves "scratching surface of ample," Fed may need to intervene as early as January 2026. **Moderate-to-strong evidence** of ongoing liquidity tightness.

**Irrelevant Sources:**
- Mortgage rate articles (multiple): Discuss SOFR as a benchmark but provide no information about future SOFR values.
- International articles (Spain, Philippines, Saudi Arabia, etc.): Not relevant to US SOFR.
- Cryptocurrency, stock trading: No bearing on SOFR.

**Key Expert/Institutional Opinions:**
- TD Securities: Reserves may be at edge of "ample," Fed intervention possible Q1 2026.
- J.P. Morgan (Sam Zief): Liquidity no longer "ample," small supply/demand shifts causing volatility.
- Deutsche Bank: Fed could adjust IORB rate to ease funding pressures.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Recent stability under current policy**: Since 14 Dec 2025 rate cut to 3.50-3.75%, SOFR has traded 3.62-3.75% with mean 3.66%, σ=0.036%. Last print 3.65% on 12 Feb. No FOMC meeting scheduled before 26 Feb. (Primary source data)
2. **Month-end volatility pattern**: Historical evidence shows SOFR can spike significantly at month-end (31 Oct: 4.22%, 31 Dec: 3.86%). However, 26 Feb is NOT month-end, reducing this risk substantially. (Multiple sources)

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Liquidity conditions tightening**: Multiple sources (Morningstar, Valor Econômico) document that reserves are approaching the edge of "ample," causing occasional funding stress. This creates upside risk but Fed has tools (Standing Repo Facility, potential IORB adjustment) to manage. (Expert opinions from TD Securities, J.P. Morgan)
2. **Fed balance sheet reduction**: Ongoing QT may be contributing to tighter conditions, though analysts expected this to pause/ease after November 2025. (Financial press)

**Weak Evidence:**
1. Market expectations for stable rates in early 2026 (options positioning) - speculative.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 9 calendar days (6 business days) from 17 Feb to 26 Feb 2026.

**If halved (3 business days)**: Would increase confidence in status quo (3.65% ±0.05%), as less time for unexpected events. Tighter distribution.

**If doubled (12 business days)**: Would widen distribution modestly, allowing more time for:
- Unexpected Fed communication/intervention
- Accumulation of liquidity stress
- Greater chance of a low-probability shock event

The short timeframe favors mean reversion and stability, but the 26th falls mid-month (not month-end), further reducing volatility risk.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view**: Mean 3.66%, with 10th-90th percentile range of 3.55-3.82%, incorporating small probability of extreme moves.

**Key factors for adjustment:**

1. **26 Feb is NOT month-end**: The outside view incorporated historical month-end spikes (Oct 31: 4.22%, Dec 31: 3.86%). Since 26 Feb is mid-month, the probability of such spikes is substantially lower. This argues for **tightening the upper tail** slightly.

2. **Very recent stability**: The last 10 business days show SOFR in a tight 3.62-3.67% range with the last print at 3.65%. This suggests **centering near 3.65%** rather than 3.66%.

3. **No scheduled catalysts**: No FOMC meeting, no major Treasury settlement dates, no obvious stress events scheduled. Supports **tighter distribution**.

4. **Liquidity concerns provide modest upside risk**: Expert warnings about reserves approaching "ample" threshold and December funding stress suggest retaining some upside tail, though Fed has demonstrated willingness to intervene via Standing Repo Facility.

5. **Historical upset rate remains valid**: The ~0.1% probability of extreme moves (±75bp) from the reference class still applies, as black-swan repo market events can occur anytime (Sep 2019 spike precedent).

**Net adjustment**: Tighten the distribution modestly around 3.65%, reduce upper tail slightly (since not month-end), but retain some fat-tail risk for unexpected liquidity stress or Fed action.

## Distribution Calibration

**Status quo continuation**: SOFR remains 3.64-3.66% (last week's range).

**Central tendency**: Given stable policy, mid-month timing, and recent prints, center the distribution at 3.65%.

**Upside scenarios** (pushing toward 3.75-4.00%):
- Unexpected liquidity stress (moderate probability ~10%)
- Collateral shortage (low probability ~3%)
- Risk-off event requiring safe asset hoarding (very low ~1%)

**Downside scenarios** (pushing toward 3.50-3.60%):
- Unexpected Fed intervention/liquidity injection (low probability ~5%)
- Flight from risk assets into repo market (very low ~2%)
- Emergency Fed rate cut (extremely low <1%)

**Tail calibration**:
- 10th percentile: Allow for modest downside from Fed intervention or unusually loose conditions: 3.58%
- 90th percentile: Allow for funding stress (not as severe as month-end): 3.76%
- Median: 3.65% (status quo)
- Mean: ~3.66% (slightly above median due to fatter upper tail from liquidity risk)

**Distribution shape**: Slightly right-skewed (longer upper tail) due to liquidity concerns, but much tighter than outside view due to mid-month timing and short timeframe.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: SOFR value (percent) on 26 Feb 2026, published 27 Feb. Resolution window: 9 days ahead. ✓

2. **Base rate**: Outside view centered at 3.66% with 10th-90th range 3.55-3.82%. My forecast tightens this to 3.58-3.76%, justified by mid-month timing and recent stability. ✓

3. **Consistency**: Implied median = 3.65%; mean ≈ 3.66%. This aligns with last print (3.65%), recent average (3.66%), and stable policy environment. ✓

4. **Key evidence**:
   - SOFR = 3.65% on 12 Feb; range 3.62-3.75% since Dec rate cut (factual, primary source)
   - 26 Feb is mid-month, not month-end; reduces spike risk (factual, calendar)
   - No FOMC meeting before 26 Feb (factual, Fed calendar)
   - Liquidity tightening documented but Fed has intervention tools (expert consensus, demonstrated in Dec)
   - Historical month-end spikes (Oct: 4.22%, Dec: 3.86%) not applicable to mid-month (factual, primary data)

5. **Blind-spot**: Unexpected repo market seizure (like Sep 2019) could push SOFR to 4.5%+, making my 90th percentile (3.76%) look far too conservative. However, Fed's Standing Repo Facility now exists as backstop, reducing this risk vs. 2019. Would push outcome UP.

6. **Status quo**: Last print 3.65%, recent range 3.62-3.67%. My median of 3.65% and tight distribution around it appropriately reflects low volatility environment and short timeframe. ✓

7. **Technicalities**: Percentiles strictly increasing, units in Percent, all values within bounds [3.094, 5.09542]. ✓
