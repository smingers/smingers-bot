## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **SOFR values over 9 business days (Feb 14-26, 2026)**
   - Suitability: HIGH - Most directly relevant
   - The question asks for the value on Feb 26, which is 9 business days after the last known value (Feb 13)
   - SOFR is a daily rate that typically shows modest day-to-day variation

2. **SOFR behavior during stable policy periods**
   - Suitability: HIGH - No FOMC meetings between now and target date
   - When Fed policy is unchanged, SOFR tends to trade in a narrow range around the lower bound of the federal funds target range
   - Current target range: 3.50-3.75%, suggesting SOFR should cluster near 3.50-3.70%

3. **SOFR volatility around month-end/quarter-end**
   - Suitability: MODERATE - Feb 26 is near month-end but not quarter-end
   - Month-end effects are typically modest (5-15 bp moves)
   - Quarter-end effects are larger but not applicable here

4. **Recent 3-month SOFR trend**
   - Suitability: MODERATE - Shows declining trend but may not persist
   - Decline reflects past Fed cuts; no new cuts scheduled

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 9 business days (Feb 14-26, 2026)

**Historical Patterns Over Similar Periods:**

From the daily data provided:
- **10-day ranges in recent period:**
  - Jan 20-Feb 2: 3.66-3.69% (3 bp range)
  - Feb 2-13: 3.63-3.69% (6 bp range)
  - Jan 6-17: 3.66-3.68% (2 bp range)

- **Typical daily changes:** 0-3 basis points
- **Maximum observed daily change (Dec-Feb):** ~5 basis points
- **Standard behavior:** SOFR clusters tightly around a central value during stable policy periods

**Recent Trend:**
- Early December: ~3.73-3.75%
- Late December: ~3.65-3.71%
- January: ~3.66-3.68%
- Early February: ~3.63-3.69%
- Latest (Feb 9-13): 3.63-3.66%

The trend shows gradual decline with SOFR settling around 3.65% in recent days.

## (d) Justification

**Key factors supporting outside view:**

1. **Policy stability:** With no FOMC meetings until March 17-18, the policy environment is locked in. The federal funds target range (3.50-3.75%) provides a natural anchor.

2. **Recent stability:** SOFR has traded in a tight 3.63-3.69% range over the past two weeks, with most observations at 3.65-3.66%.

3. **Technical factors:** SOFR typically trades 10-20 bp above the lower bound of the target range during normal conditions. With the lower bound at 3.50%, this suggests a natural center around 3.60-3.70%.

4. **Month-end proximity:** Feb 26 is late in the month but not the final day. Some modest upward pressure is possible (2-5 bp) from month-end balance sheet adjustments, but effects are typically small outside quarter-ends.

5. **Historical volatility:** Over 9 business days during stable policy periods, SOFR rarely moves more than 10 bp from its starting point.

**Base case:** SOFR should remain close to the current 3.66% level, likely trading in a 3.60-3.70% range with most probability mass around 3.64-3.68%.

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring to recent behavior:**
- The last value (Feb 13) is 3.66%
- The 10-day average (Feb 2-13) is 3.66%
- The recent range (Feb 2-13) is 3.63-3.69%

**Distribution considerations:**

1. **Central tendency:** Strong clustering around 3.65-3.66% based on recent stability
2. **Upside risks:** Month-end effects could push toward 3.70-3.72%
3. **Downside risks:** Continued softness could see 3.60-3.62%
4. **Tail risks:** 
   - Extreme downside (<3.55%): Would require unexpected market stress or policy signal
   - Extreme upside (>3.75%): Would require significant market disruption or technical factors

**Calibration approach:**
- 10th percentile: Account for continued softness plus modest downside surprise
- Median (50th): Near current level with slight upward bias for month-end
- 90th percentile: Account for month-end effects plus modest upside surprise

**Historical upset rate:** SOFR is highly stable during inter-meeting periods. Major surprises (>15 bp moves over 9 days) are rare absent policy changes or market stress. This supports a relatively tight distribution but not overconfident.

**Width considerations:** 
- The 10th-90th percentile range should span roughly 15-20 bp to capture realistic uncertainty
- This is wider than the recent 6 bp range but narrower than the full 1-year range
