Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED SOFR series page (updated 14 Feb 2026): latest published fixings 3.66 % (Feb-13), 3.65 % (Feb-12).  Primary, high-quality, factual.  
2. NY Fed methodology page: confirms publication time and that SOFR is a secured-repo median; no forward view.  Authoritative background.  
3. TradingEconomics SOFR page (pulled 17 Feb 2026): repeats 3.65 % latest; gives full history.  Reliable but secondary.  
4. Securities Finance Times 7 Jan 2026 (BrokerTec volumes): shows heavy repo activity after year-end, implies markets functioning normally.  Informative context; single trade-press source.  
5. Morningstar 2 Dec 2025 & GuruFocus 6 Nov 2025: describe funding-market tightness in Oct/Nov but subsequent calming.  Moderate quality; slightly dated yet relevant as stress comparator.  
6. Financial Post 9 Dec 2025: SOFR options flows signal expectation of gradual cuts into Q1-26.  Market-derived sentiment; moderate value.  
Other AskNews items (mortgage articles, ECB EUREP, crypto drop, etc.) have no direct bearing on the overnight Treasury-repo rate and are ignored.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong:  
• Fed target range 3.50-3.75 % was held on 28 Jan 2026 (FOMC statement, primary).  
• Historical pattern: when the target is unchanged and no quarter-end is imminent, SOFR trades 0-10 bp either side of 3.65 % (Jan–mid-Feb tape).  
Moderate:  
• Month-end (27/28 Feb) sometimes adds 2-5 bp upward bias.  
• SOFR options positioning points to gentle downward drift later in Q1, but not necessarily inside the next 7 business days.  
Weak:  
• Year-end 2025 funding squeeze (SOFR 3.86 %) illustrates tail risk but required extreme balance-sheet constraints not present in late February.  
• General macro news (crypto sell-off, overseas mortgage rates) is only tangential.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Days until fixing: 9 calendar (7 U.S. business).  Halving (≈4 days) would cut room for funding-pressure surprises; distribution would narrow by ~20 %.  Doubling (≈18 days) would straddle the March 10-11 FOMC blackout but still pre-meeting; distribution would widen by ~25 % because of growing policy-shift rumours.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base-rate centre = recent mean 3.66 %.  
Upward nudges: modest month-end demand (+2 bp), SOFR currently 1-2 bp below IORB so room to edge higher.  
Downward nudges: reserve levels ample, January stress dissipated.  
Tail allowances:  
• 5 % chance a fleeting collateral shortage spikes SOFR ≥ 3.85 %.  
• 10 % chance abundant cash pushes it ≤ 3.58 %.  
Combining, I shift the median 3 bp higher (to 3.69 %) and widen the 10th/90th percentiles to ±14–16 bp versus the centre.

Distribution calibration
Median (≈60th percentile) 3.69 %.  10th–90th spread 0.30 pp, roughly triple the recent 1-week realized σ (keeps humility).  Skew slightly right due to month-end/spike risk.

Checklist:
1. Target: daily SOFR fixing (percent) for value date 26 Feb 2026.  
2. Outside-view distribution stated; final still anchored.  
3. Implied median ≈ 3.69 %, mean ≈ 3.70 % – coherent with rationale.  
4. Top evidence: a) Fed range 3.50-3.75 %; b) Latest prints 3.65-3.66 %; c) Month-end drift +2-5 bp; d) Calm funding markets post-Jan.  
5. Blind spot: sudden late-Feb Treasury-settlement hiccup driving SOFR above 4 % (would push forecast too low).  
6. Status-quo bias checked; distribution still centred near latest value.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, units = percent, within open bounds.
