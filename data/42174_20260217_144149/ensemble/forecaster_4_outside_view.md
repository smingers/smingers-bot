Analysis:

(a)  Source analysis  
• FRED series pages (four URLs). Purely factual: definition of SOFR, units, release schedule. Reliable (Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis / New York Fed); data current to the last published fixing, 13 Feb 2026.  
• Agent report. Collated all daily SOFR fixings from 1 Dec 2025–13 Feb 2026 and listed the FOMC calendar. Factual, dated 16 Feb 2026, traceable to primary Fed sources.  
• New York-Fed “SOFR Averages and Index” page. Methodology only; no forward-looking statements. Reliable.  
• Other articles (Deloitte, Capital.com, Goldman Sachs) concern software stocks or India’s economy—irrelevant to SOFR; provide no usable facts or expert opinion for this forecast.

Only the FRED data and the Fed calendar are germane; they are high-quality primary sources.

(b)  Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. Entire 2018-2026 daily SOFR history (≈1 900 observations).  
2. Days when the federal-funds target range was the same as today (3.50–3.75 %, 14 Dec 2025–present).  
3. All periods in which the target range was unchanged for ≥30 days (captures normal drift under a steady policy rate).

Class 2 is the most appropriate: it controls for the current policy stance and liquidity environment while supplying ~45 observations—enough for a decent empirical distribution without mixing in regimes with very different policy rates.

(c)  Time-frame analysis  
Today is 17 Feb 2026; the SOFR fixing for 26 Feb 2026 will be published the morning of 27 Feb 2026—nine calendar days (six U.S. business days) ahead.  In the 45 business days since the 10 Dec 2025 rate cut, SOFR has ranged 3.62–3.75 % with a mean of 3.66 % and a standard deviation of 0.036 %.  Daily moves have been tiny (|Δ| ≤ 0.07 %), and there is no scheduled FOMC meeting before 26 Feb.  However, history shows that repo-market idiosyncrasies (e.g. 17 Sep 2019 spike; March 2020 pandemic shock) can produce one-day deviations of ≥100 bp, albeit with very low frequency (~0.1 % of days).

(d)  Justification for the outside view  
• Status-quo expectation: another print near 3.65 %, because the policy rate and liquidity backdrop are stable and month-end effects are minor on the 26th.  
• Upside tail: a sudden collateral shortage or risk-off event could push SOFR well above the top of the fed-funds target (as happened in 2019), but such events are rare.  
• Downside tail: only an unscheduled FOMC cut or a major liquidity surge would knock SOFR sharply lower; neither is on the calendar, but a surprise cut after a market shock is conceivable.  
• Historical upset rate: ∼0.1 % of observations have been ≥75 bp away from the local mean when policy was steady.  Therefore the 10th/90th percentiles should sit roughly ±0.10–0.15 % from the centre, with a small allowance for extreme surprises beyond that.

Outside view calibration:

Base distribution: mean 3.66 %, σ 0.04 % (empirical).  
Adjust tails: add a low-probability (≈2 %) mixture component allowing ±0.75 % jumps to capture historical spikes/drops.  Convolving gives a slightly fatter-tailed distribution.

Resulting percentiles (monotone, rounded to two decimals):

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.55  
Percentile 20: 3.60  
Percentile 40: 3.64  
Percentile 60: 3.67  
Percentile 80: 3.71  
Percentile 90: 3.82
