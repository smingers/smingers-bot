Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED SOFR series: primary data, last published value 3.65 % on 12 Feb 2026 (factual, high-quality, daily).  
2. TradingEconomics SOFR page: echoes the same 3.65 % print and long-run min/max (factual, current, reliable).  
3. New York Fed SOFR background page: methodology only (neutral, not forward-looking).  
4. BrokerTec repo-volume article (7 Jan 2026) & ECB EUREP update (16 Feb 2026): show active repo markets and ample non-US liquidity lines; indirectly indicate no U-S funding stress at present (moderate evidence).  
5. Standing Repo Facility record use (2 Jan 2026) & month-end spike on 31 Dec 2025: illustrate that SOFR can briefly overshoot the fed-funds ceiling by 10-15 bp under acute quarter-/year-end pressures (strong historical evidence but low base rate).  
6. Bond-option positioning article (9 Dec 2025) & Morningstar note (2 Dec 2025): market prices more cuts for mid-2026 but none imminent; reinforces expectation of policy hold for next few weeks (moderate evidence).  
All other AskNews items discuss mortgages, foreign exchange, crypto etc.; none affect near-term SOFR fixing (ignored for forecast).

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong: historical daily dispersion of SOFR during same fed-funds range (3.62–3.75 %, σ≈4 bp); absence of FOMC meetings until 17 Mar 2026.  
Moderate: typical month-end “turn” effect of +2–6 bp two business days before month-end; recent repo-volume growth without stress.  
Weak: tail-risk precedents (Sep 2019, Dec 2025) that produced ≥+20 bp spikes; <0.3 % base frequency.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Target date is Thursday 26 Feb 2026—9 days/6 U.S. business days out.  If horizon were halved (3 bdays) I’d tighten the 80–20 band by ~10 %; if doubled (12 bdays) I’d widen it by ~20 % to allow more chance of an exogenous shock.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Base distribution (same-policy reference window):  
μ = 3.66 %, σ = 0.04 %.  
Adjustments:  
+1 bp midpoint uplift for mild month-end funding demand (evidence: repeated Feb patterns 2021-25).  
+½ bp extra upper-tail mass for unlikely but plausible funding squeeze.  
+½ bp extra lower-tail mass for <0.1 % chance of unscheduled policy cut or technical adjustment.  
Resulting subjective distribution is marginally skewed right of the base rate.

Distribution calibration
Percentile 10: 3.57 %   (allows for rare cut / low demand)  
Percentile 20: 3.60 %  
Percentile 40: 3.64 %  
Percentile 60: 3.67 %  
Percentile 80: 3.71 %  
Percentile 90: 3.80 %   (covers month-end squeeze or idiosyncratic spike)

Checklist:
1. Target: Daily SOFR fixing, percent, on 26 Feb 2026.  
2. Outside base: N(3.66,0.04).  
3. Implied median ≈ 3.66, mean ≈ 3.66; consistent with evidence.  
4. Key facts: a) current prints 3.65; b) no FOMC until Mar; c) month-end usually +2–6 bp; d) extreme spikes rare (<0.3 %).  
5. Blind-spot: sudden Treasury-cash shortage causing SOFR >4.10 % (+45 bp). Would push outcome upward.  
6. Status-quo bias checked—base rate dominates; only small adjustments made.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units in percent; inside stated open bounds.
