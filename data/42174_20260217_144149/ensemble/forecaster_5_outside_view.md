Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
• FRED series page & FREDData extract (latest obs = 3.66 % on 13 Feb 2026). Primary, high-quality, purely factual, updated daily.  
• Agent_report – reproduces the full list of daily fixings 1 Dec 2025–13 Feb 2026 and the FOMC calendar/outcomes. Well-sourced, dates and numbers match the public record; judged reliable.  
• New York Fed “SOFR Averages and Index” page – background methodology only, no forward data; neutral quality but not decision-relevant.  
• Four other articles (Deloitte software outlook, TTWO stock forecast, Goldman Sachs on India, etc.) – unrelated to SOFR; ignored.  

b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. All SOFR observations since the series began in April 2018 (min 0.01, max 5.40).  Too broad; includes multiple tightening/easing cycles.  
2. SOFR during periods when the fed-funds target range was the same as now (3.50 – 3.75 %) – i.e., 11 Dec 2025 to present.  Most directly comparable; 45 business-day history gives a range 3.62–3.75 % with s.d. ≈ 0.04 %.  
3. “Quiet windows” between FOMC meetings over the last five years when policy was unchanged and not at quarter-end.  Slightly larger sample but still tightly clustered (typical ±7 bp).  
Class 2 is chosen: same policy, same liquidity backdrop.  

c) Timeframe analysis  
Target date is 26 Feb 2026 – nine calendar days (six U.S. business days) away.  No scheduled FOMC meeting before then; the next is 17-18 Mar 2026.  Therefore the dominant drivers are normal day-to-day GC-repo demand and any month-end funding pressure (26 Feb is the Wednesday before a Friday month-end that actually falls on a weekend).  Historically, month-end can lift SOFR by 2-6 bp; quarter-end can move it 5-15 bp.  

d) Justification  
• In the 45-day reference window SOFR traded 3.62–3.75 %; median 3.66 %.  
• Day-to-day changes have been ≤ 3 bp in 90 % of cases; there has been no print > 5 bp away from the running 5-day mean.  
• Unsched­uled FOMC cuts/ hikes are rare (< 0.5 % of days in the 2018-2026 sample).  Even if one occurred, the maximum one-step shift ever recorded (COVID-19, 15 Mar 2020) was -100 bp; a +100 bp emergency hike has never occurred in the SOFR era.  I assign roughly a 0.1 % chance to such an event in the six-day window – it fattens the lower tail slightly.  
• Repo-market stress events (e.g., Sep 2019) that pushed SOFR up 200+ bp have occurred on ≈ 0.2 % of business days.  Feb-month-end is not usually a stress point, but I allow a small upper-tail probability.  

Outside view calibration:
Anchor on a normal distribution with μ = 3.66 %, σ = 0.04 %, then widen tails for the two low-probability shock scenarios just noted.  The resulting subjective CDF places:  
• 80 % of probability in the 3.60–3.72 % band (±6 bp), matching recent dispersion plus month-end effect.  
• 10 % below 3.60 %, capturing both ordinary downside variance and a sliver (≈ 0.5 %) for an emergency rate cut.  
• 10 % above 3.72 %, including ordinary upside variance and a very small (≈ 0.5 %) allowance for a funding-stress spike.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.55  
Percentile 20: 3.60  
Percentile 40: 3.64  
Percentile 60: 3.67  
Percentile 80: 3.72  
Percentile 90: 3.80
