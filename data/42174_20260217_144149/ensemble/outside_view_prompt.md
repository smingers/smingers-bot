You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
What will be the value of "Secured Overnight Financing Rate" on 2026-02-26?

Question background:
The Federal Reserve Economic Data database (FRED) provides economic data from national, international, public, and private sources. The series SOFR is a dataset that is tracked by the FRED API. It represents the Federal Reserve's Secured Overnight Financing Rate. The title of the series is "Secured Overnight Financing Rate". The last data point on the graph (as of creation of this question) is from 2026-02-12 and has a value of 3.65. The units of the series are "Percent". The update frequency of the series is "Daily". The seasonal adjustment of the series is "Not Seasonally Adjusted". An interactive graph for the series can be found [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/SOFR). Below are the notes attached to the series:

# Summary of Article: "The Outlook for India's Economy in 2026 amid A New US Trade Deal"

**Source:** Goldman Sachs

**Key Facts and Statistics:**

1. **India GDP Growth Forecasts:**
   - 2025: 7.7% year-on-year (real, inflation-adjusted)
   - 2026: 6.9% year-on-year (above consensus estimates)
   - 2027: 6.8% year-on-year (above consensus estimates)
   - Note: Nominal GDP growth in 2025 was at a six-year low (excluding pandemic) due to record-low inflation

2. **US-India Trade Deal (announced early February):**
   - "Reciprocal" tariffs on Indian goods reduced from 25% to 18%
   - This brings India's tariff rate in line with most other Asian countries (15-19% range)
   - Expected incremental growth boost: 0.2 percentage points of GDP (annualized)
   - Based on India's goods exports exposure of roughly 4% of GDP to US final demand

3. **Inflation:**
   - 2025: Averaged 2.2% year-over-year (significantly lower, driven by lower food inflation)
   - 2026 forecast: 3.9% year-over-year (close to RBI's 4% target)
   - Core inflation increased in 2025 due to higher precious metals inflation (mainly gold)

4. **Reserve Bank of India (RBI) Policy:**
   - Cut rates by 125 basis points in 2025
   - Injected 6.3 trillion rupees ($70 billion) in liquidity measures into the banking system

5. **Consumption Growth:**
   - 2025: Real private consumption grew 7.4% year-on-year (four-quarter rolling average basis)
   - 2026 forecast: Real consumption growth estimated to rise by around 70 basis points to 7.7% year-on-year from 7% in 2025

6. **Current Account:**
   - Q4 2025: Current account deficit widened to around 2.8% of GDP (up from 1.3% previous quarter)
   - Full year 2025: Expected to remain contained at 0.7% of GDP
   - 2026 forecast: Current account deficit expected to widen to $37 billion
   - Services exports grew around 11% year-on-year in 2025

7. **Capital Flows:**
   - Indian equity markets saw around $19 billion in portfolio outflows from foreign investors
   - Debt inflows were around $7.5 billion

**Named Source Opinions:**

- **Santanu Sengupta, Goldman Sachs Research's chief India economist:** "We see limited scope for further policy rate easing by the RBI." However, if uncertainty related to US tariffs persists beyond Q1 and weighs heavily on growth, an additional 25 basis point cut may be possible.

- **Goldman Sachs Research economists:** The US trade deal will improve private investment intentions, but "we expect a lag before this translates into actual capex execution and hence we are not incorporating this into our forecasts at the moment." They note "there could be further upside to real GDP growth from a recovery in private capex in the latter half of [2026]."

**Relevance to SOFR Question:**

This article focuses exclusively on India's economy and does not contain any information about the US Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR) or US monetary policy.

No SOFR fixings for 14 February 2026 through 26 February 2026 have been published yet; therefore the future observation for 26 February 2026 cannot presently be known. (FRED SOFR series, accessed 16 February 2026)

Scheduled FOMC meetings and policy actions still in force before 26 February 2026

The Federal Open Market Committee sets its calendar a year in advance (Federal Reserve “Meeting calendars and information”, federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm). Between 1 December 2025 and 26 February 2026 the only regularly scheduled policy meetings were:

• 28-29 October 2025  
• 9-10 December 2025  
• 27-28 January 2026

The next regular meeting is 17-18 March 2026, after the target date in question.

Policy outcomes to date

• 10 December 2025 – Target range for the federal-funds rate lowered 25 bp to 3.50 %–3.75 % (Equals Money explainer summarising the FOMC statement, equalsmoney.com/economic-calendar/events/fomc-meeting).  
• 28 January 2026 – Target range left unchanged at 3.50 %–3.75 % (J.P. Morgan Wealth Management post-meeting commentary dated 29 Jan 2026). No balance-sheet or standing-facility changes were announced.  

Since the January meeting there are no emergency sessions, minutes addenda, or implementation-note changes listed on the Federal Reserve’s official calendar through 15 February 2026 (Federal Reserve Calendar, federalreserve.gov/newsevents/calendar.htm). Therefore, barring an unscheduled meeting, the stance set on 10 December 2025 and affirmed on 28 January 2026 will remain in effect on 26 February 2026.

Key take-aways for the forecasting problem

1. All SOFR observations that exist today have been provided above; data for 14–26 February 2026 are not yet available anywhere because those business days have not occurred.  
2. No further scheduled FOMC meetings or policy-rate decisions fall between the last published SOFR (13 February 2026) and the target date (26 February 2026).  
3. Consequently, unless the Federal Reserve convenes an unscheduled meeting, the policy environment that will guide SOFR on 26 February 2026 is the one announced on 10 December 2025 and left unchanged on 28 January 2026.  
4. The value that will ultimately appear on FRED for 26 February 2026 will only be known once the New York Fed publishes that day’s SOFR fixing at approximately 8:00 a.m. ET on 27 February 2026 and FRED ingests it shortly thereafter.

Remaining information gap

• The actual SOFR fixing for 26 February 2026 (and for any intervening business day beginning 14 February 2026) is not yet published; it will fill automatically on FRED after those dates arrive.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
