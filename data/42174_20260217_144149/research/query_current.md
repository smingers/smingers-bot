Analysis:
The SOFR is closely linked to the Fed’s target range for the federal-funds rate and to near-term liquidity conditions in the Treasury repo market. Because the next FOMC meeting is in March, the biggest drivers of the rate through Feb 26 will be: 1) day-to-day repo supply-demand imbalances (e.g., Treasury settlements, bill auctions, GSE cash flows), 2) any Fed open-market operations that absorb or add reserves, and 3) market expectations for the March meeting that could affect collateral demand. Therefore, the most useful near-term information will be very recent commentary from money-market analysts, primary dealer notes, and news on repo-market dynamics—especially items dated in mid-February 2026 that discuss conditions for the second half of the month. I will search for: (a) data releases and commentary on SOFR prints this week, (b) news about Treasury cash-management and bill auction calendars around Feb 20-26, and (c) analyst notes on expected stability or volatility in overnight rates.
