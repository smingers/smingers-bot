Analysis:
To forecast SOFR for 26 Feb 2026 we need an “outside view” built from:  
• The recent daily behavior of SOFR (level and volatility).  
• Any Federal Reserve target-rate changes (SOFR stays close to the bottom of the fed-funds target range/RRP rate).  
• Calendar effects (month-end, quarter-end, Treasury settlements) that sometimes push repo rates.  
Therefore, useful historical context includes: (a) the last few weeks of SOFR readings; (b) Fed announcements or credible news about near-term policy moves; and (c) typical SOFR behavior around mid-to-late February in earlier years.  These items can be gathered from FRED, general web pages, and recent news coverage.
