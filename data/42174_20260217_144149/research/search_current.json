EUREP provides backstop euro liquidity to non-euro area central banks against high-quality euro-denominated collateral\n   - The facility was first introduced in 2020\n\n3. **Framework Updates:**\n   - Introduces standing access, in principle, for all central banks (with exclusions for money laundering, terrorist financing, or international sanctions concerns)\n   - Enables central banks outside the euro area to address euro liquidity shortage risks swiftly\n   - Aims to make the facility more flexible, geographically broader, and more relevant for global holders of euro securities\n\n4. **Rationale (per ECB):**\n   - The world economy has undergone \"profound structural shifts\" since 2020 related to geopolitics and changes in the international financial system\n   - These shifts have altered global trade and financial integration dynamics\n   - The macroeconomic and financial environment is expected to remain \"uncertain and potentially more volatile\" with more frequent financial disruptions\n   -

'Young People Who Leveraged Everything' Face Crisis as Mortgage Rates Approach 7%**\nSouth Korea's major commercial banks\u2014KB Kookmin, Shinhan, Hana, Woori, and NH Nonghyup\u2014have seen their fixed-rate mortgage (home loan) interest rates reach up to 6.74% as of February 13, 2026, nearing the 7% threshold. This marks a significant increase from the previous year, driven by rising benchmark financial instrument rates, including the 5-year AAA corporate bond yield (3.687%, up 0.188 percentage points from 3.499% in December 2024) and the COFIX (funding cost index), which rose to 2.89% in December 2024, continuing a four-month upward trend since September 2024. The Bank of Korea\u2019s rate-cutting cycle has effectively ended, and continued tightening of household loan regulations is expected to keep mortgage rates elevated. This has intensified financial pressure on 'Young People Who Leveraged Everything' (\uc601\ub04c\uc871), borrowers who secured loans at near-2% rates five years ago, now facing potential rate resets to 4\u20135% or higher. In response, financial regulators are considering introducing 30-year fixed-rate mortgage products to provide long-term stability. However, due to higher fixed rates, borrowers are increasingly opting for variable-rate loans: the share of variable-rate home loans rose to 13.4% in December 2025 (up from 9.8% in November), the highest level since December 2024, while variable-rate loans now account for 51.1% of all household loans, down from 53.2% in December 2024 but still above half.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 02:26 AM\nSource:[mk.co.kr](https://www.mk.co.kr/news/economy/11964197)\n\n**On Monday 16th of February Blackstone Secured Lending trades -1.99 percent lower**\nBlackstone Secured Lending (BXSL) traded -1.99% lower over a 24-hour period ending at 09:10 PM Central Europe on Monday, February 16, 2026, with a current stock price of USD 24.62.

The rally, driven by thin holiday trading across Asia\u2014due to closures in the US, China, Taiwan, Indonesia, and South Korea\u2014was limited to a 3.4-centavo gain from the prior session.

This anticipated rate cut, combined with better-than-expected inflation data in the US and expectations of future Federal Reserve rate cuts, is expected to keep the dollar steady and reduce pressure on the peso. The BSP reiterated it would allow market forces to determine the exchange rate, intervening only if a prolonged decline threatens imported inflation, not to smooth daily fluctuations.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:12 PM\nSource:[Inquirer](https://business.inquirer.net/574644/peso-climbs-to-571-level)\n\n**Amplify Samsung SOFR ETF (NYSEARCA:SOFR) Sees Large Decrease in Short Interest**\nThe Amplify Samsung SOFR ETF (NYSEARCA:SOFR) experienced a significant decrease in short interest, according to recent data.

For a $100,000 loan, monthly principal and interest payments are approximately $601, with total interest over the loan\u2019s life estimated at $116,834. The 15-year fixed mortgage rate decreased to 5.21% (down 0.12 percentage points), with an APR of 5.25%, resulting in a monthly payment of $802 and $44,689 in total interest. Conversely, the 30-year jumbo mortgage rate rose slightly to 6.50% (up from 6.49%), leading to a monthly payment of $632 and $127,947 in total interest. The Federal Reserve held the federal funds rate steady at 3.50%\u20133.75% at its January 28, 2026, FOMC meeting, pausing further cuts amid economic data evaluation. Mortgage rates are influenced by the Fed\u2019s policy, U.S. Treasury yields, inflation, and borrower-specific factors such as credit score and debt-to-income ratio. A good mortgage rate is generally considered to be at or below the mid-6% range for 30-year fixed loans. Experts note that while rates may decline if inflation cools or the economy weakens, a return to 3% levels is unlikely in the near term. The APR reflects the total cost of borrowing, including fees, and is typically higher than the interest rate. Borrowers are advised to compare multiple lenders within a 45-day window to avoid credit score damage and secure the best terms. Despite elevated rates and low housing inventory, strategic financial preparation\u2014such as maintaining a credit score above 670, a DTI below 43%, and a 20% down payment\u2014can improve access to competitive rates.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 10:05 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/mortgages/mortgage-rates-02-16-26/)\n\n**Couples Need 5,000 Euros Monthly Income to Secure a Mortgage in Spain**\nIn Spain, couples need a combined monthly income of 5,017.49 euros on average to secure a mortgage, according to a Trioteca report published on February 16, 2026. This figure reflects the rising cost of housing, with the average mortgage amount reaching 216,748 euros in 2025 due to limited supply and increasing demand. The median age for couples taking out a new mortgage is 38.3 years\u201441 for married couples, 39 for cohabiting couples, and 35 for those without formal union\u2014with 55% of new mortgages taken by couples aged 30 to 39. In refinancing cases, the median age rises to 44. Trioteca\u2019s CEO, Ricard Garriga, explains that couples are delaying commitment not due to lack of desire for shared life projects, but because they now require greater financial stability. Over 84% of couples finance no more than 80% of the property\u2019s value, with an average financing level of 74.5%, and 91.5% choose fixed-rate mortgages with a mean interest rate of 2.21% TIN, prioritizing predictability and security after past volatility linked to the Euribor. Looking ahead to 2026, Trioteca emphasizes that mortgage decisions will be increasingly strategic, requiring financial maturity, savings capacity, and proactive planning, marking a shift from impulsive to deeply considered choices.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 09:19 AM\nSource:[La Raz\u00f3n](https://www.larazon.es/economia/pareja-necesita-ganar-5000-euros-mes-conjunto-hipotecarse_202602166992e12e1817b41eb64ab785.html)\n\n**Current ARM mortgage rates report for Feb. 16, 2026 | Fortune**\nFortune published a report on February 16, 2026, detailing current adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) rates, based on data as of February 13, 2026. The article explains that while 92% of U.S. homeowners with mortgages have fixed-rate loans, ARMs may be advantageous for specific borrowers. These include buyers of temporary or 'starter homes' who plan to sell before the adjustable period begins, real estate investors seeking to flip properties or adjust rental rates, and buyers in high-interest-rate environments who benefit from lower initial rates. A 7/6 ARM, for example, features a fixed rate for seven years followed by semiannual adjustments. ARMs are tied to benchmark rates like the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), with lenders adding a margin (typically 2%\u20133.5%) to determine the final rate. Rate caps limit increases: initial, subsequent, and lifetime caps prevent excessive rate hikes. Common ARM structures include 5/1, 10/6, 3/1, 7/1, and 10/1 ARMs. The article notes that refinancing from an ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage is feasible and common, especially when homeowners decide to stay long-term. Pros include lower initial rates; cons include uncertainty due to future rate adjustments. Sample rates provided are hypothetical and based on assumed credit profiles and locations, with actual rates varying upon application.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 08:01 AM\nSource:[Fortune](https://fortune.com/article/current-arm-mortgage-rates-02-16-2026/)\n\n**Cryptocurrency Market Plummets Overnight, Bitcoin May Drop to $31,000**\nOn the night of February 15, 2026, the cryptocurrency market experienced a significant downturn. By 6:30 a.m. on February 16, Bitcoin had dropped by more than 1%, Ethereum fell nearly 6%, and Solana declined by approximately 2%. Within the past 24 hours, over 117,000 traders worldwide were forced into liquidation, resulting in a total liquidation value of $330 million. A prominent independent macro and market strategy research institution recently forecasted that Bitcoin could further decline to $31,000, representing a potential drop of about 55% from its current price. This prediction is closely tied to rapid shifts in macroeconomic expectations, particularly regarding the Federal Reserve\u2019s monetary policy. Market data indicates that the probability of the Fed initiating rate cuts in June has risen to 83%, up from 49.9% previously. Meanwhile, the likelihood of a 25-basis-point rate cut at the March meeting has decreased to 9.8%, down from 19.6% in earlier forecasts.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 03:24 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u5173\u6751\u5728\u7ebf](https://news.zol.com.cn/1135/11355995.html)\n\n**How to pay for home improvements in 2026 - Which?**\nThe article from Which? outlines financing options for home improvements in 2026, categorized by cost. For minor projects (up to \u00a35,000), such as painting or window replacement, credit cards and unsecured personal loans are viable. A loan at 6.9% interest for \u00a35,000 over three years incurs \u00a3532 in interest, compared to \u00a3709 on a credit card at 8.9%, and \u00a32,358 on a typical credit card with a 26.7% APR. Interest-free credit cards offering 0% for up to 25 months can avoid interest if paid off quickly, but cash withdrawals incur immediate interest and may harm credit scores. Money transfer cards allow borrowing into a bank account with interest-free periods (up to 14 months), typically with a 3.99% fee\u2014except Virgin Money\u2019s 24-month offer with no fee. For mid-range projects (\u00a310,000\u2013\u00a325,000), such as underfloor heating or bathroom renovations, unsecured loans (best rate 5.6%) are faster and easier than secured loans, but repayment terms are usually capped at five years. Tesco Bank offers up to 10-year terms for new customers with Clubcards. Secured loans, including remortgaging or unencumbered mortgages, allow repayment over decades but require home valuations, affordability checks, and may have age limits (average 78). Equity release is an option for those over 55, with no monthly repayments until death, sale, or care, but debt grows significantly\u2014e.g., \u00a350,000 borrowed at age 55 could rise to \u00a3400,615 by age 85 at 7.18% AER. Rates are higher than standard mortgages (7.73% average), and financial advice is mandatory. For large projects like kitchen makeovers or extensions, secured loans are typically required. The article stresses the importance of affordability checks and using eligibility checkers before applying to avoid multiple hard credit inquiries. An example shows that adding \u00a350,000 to a mortgage with five years remaining increases monthly repayments by \u00a3916 to \u00a32,748 at the best rate (as of 11 February).\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 12:05 AM\nSource:[Which?](https://www.which.co.uk/news/article/how-to-pay-for-home-improvements-in-2026-ardOB3v8lGXm)\n\n**26.5 Billion Riyal in Stock Trading Financing: Surge in Direct Financing Drives Growth**\nFinancing for stock trading in Saudi Arabia reached SAR 26.5 billion by the end of the third quarter of 2025, a year-on-year increase of 10.2% compared to SAR 24.1 billion in the same period of 2024, representing a rise of SAR 2.46 billion. According to data from the Saudi Capital Market Authority (CMA), the most significant growth occurred in direct financing, which saw a 32.8% increase in clients over one year. The total number of clients benefiting from financing facilities rose to 11,842,000 by the end of Q3 2025, up from 9,811,000 in Q3 2024, an increase of 2,031,000 clients (20.7% growth). This expansion was uneven across financing types: direct financing gained 2,277,000 new clients, while indirect financing lost 246,000 clients. The actual amount of financing used reached SAR 21.561 billion in Q3 2025, up from SAR 19.798 billion a year earlier, a rise of SAR 1.764 billion (8.9% growth). The utilization rate was 81.2% in 2025, slightly down from 82.2% in 2024, indicating stable usage despite higher available funding. Direct financing led the growth in both client numbers and value: client count rose from 6,930 to 9,207,000 (+32.8%), available financing increased from SAR 22.409 billion to SAR 24.919 billion (+11.2%, +SAR 2.509 billion), and used financing rose from SAR 18.254 billion to SAR 20.146 billion (+10.3%, +SAR 1.892 billion). Direct financing now accounts for 93.8% of total available financing and 93.4% of used financing, compared to 93% and 92.2% respectively in 2024. In contrast, indirect financing declined across all metrics: clients dropped by 8.5% to 2,635,000, available financing fell by 2.8% to SAR 1.638 billion (\u2013SAR 47.3 million), and used financing decreased by 8.3% to SAR 1.416 billion (\u2013SAR 128.3 million).

The article explains that ARMs offer a low fixed interest rate for a set period\u2014such as 3, 5, 7, or 10 years\u2014followed by periodic adjustments, typically every 6 or 12 months. Common ARM structures include 5/1, 7/1, 10/1, and 10/6 ARMs, where the first number indicates the fixed-rate period and the second indicates the adjustment frequency. The report notes that fixed-rate mortgages account for about 92% of U.S. home loans, offering rate stability, while ARMs are chosen by roughly 8% of borrowers for their potential benefits. ARMs may be advantageous for investors planning to rent or flip properties, or for those who expect to move before the fixed-rate period ends. The article warns that ARM rates can increase after the initial fixed period, depending on market conditions such as the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR). It also highlights that borrowers can refinance from an ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage if their plans change, such as deciding to stay in the home longer. Sample rates are provided by lenders under hypothetical borrower assumptions involving credit profile, location, and potential discount points; actual rates may vary. The report emphasizes that working with a trusted loan officer can help determine if an ARM is suitable.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2026 10:08 AM\nSource:[Fortune](https://fortune.com/article/current-arm-mortgage-rates-02-11-2026/)\n\n**With Record Borrowing at Year-End, U.S. Market Reveals Dependence on the Fed**\nInstitutional financial entities borrowed a record $74.6 billion on December 31, 2025, through the Federal Reserve's Standing Repo Facility (SRF), a permanent liquidity tool created in 2021 to serve as an emergency valve for the U.S. money markets. This unprecedented usage occurred amid expected year-end stress due to financial closing, tax payments, and regulatory compliance. Despite the Fed\u2019s intervention, the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), the benchmark for global dollar markets, averaged 3.86% on the final day of the year\u2014above the Fed\u2019s informal upper limit of 3.75% for the federal funds rate. Some transactions even reached 4%, according to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York. The Fed also conducted bond purchases in December to increase reserve levels. Although the situation was temporary, it underscored growing market dependence on the Fed\u2019s liquidity support.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 02, 2026 05:31 PM\nSource:[Valor Econ\u00f4mico](https://valor.globo.com/financas/intraday/noticia/2026/01/02/com-emprstimos-recordes-no-fim-do-ano-mercado-americano-escancara-que-depende-do-fed.ghtml)\n\n**Current ARM mortgage rates report for Jan. 1, 2026 | Fortune**\nAs of December 31, 2025, Fortune reported on adjustable-rate mortgage (ARM) rates for January 1, 2026, highlighting that ARMs may be a strategic option for borrowers seeking low introductory rates before adjustments begin. ARMs are particularly suitable for those planning to move within a few years, real estate investors aiming to rent or flip properties, and buyers in high-interest-rate environments where initial ARM rates are lower than fixed rates. A 7/6 ARM, for example, features a fixed rate for seven years followed by adjustments every six months. While fixed-rate mortgages dominate the U.S. market\u2014comprising about 92% of home loans\u2014ARMs offer advantages in specific scenarios, with roughly 8% of borrowers choosing them. ARM rates are determined by benchmarks like SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate), lender margins (typically 2%\u20133.5%), and caps that limit rate increases. Common ARM structures include 5/1, 10/6, 3/1, 7/1, and 10/1 ARMs. The article also notes that refinancing from an ARM to a fixed-rate mortgage is possible if circumstances change, such as staying in a home longer than planned. Pros and cons of ARMs are outlined, with advice to consult a trusted loan officer to determine suitability.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 01, 2026 08:01 AM\nSource:[Fortune](https://fortune.com/article/current-arm-mortgage-rates-01-01-2026/)\n\n**Bond Traders Cast Doubt on Extended Fed Rate Cuts Past December**\nBond traders are expressing skepticism about the Federal Reserve extending rate cuts beyond December 2025, as evidenced by shifts in SOFR (Secured Overnight Financing Rate) options markets. Open interest in SOFR options expiring in June 2026 has surged, particularly in March 2026 call strike options, indicating sustained demand for upside structures that price in additional rate cuts during the first quarter of 2026. Notable trading activity includes buyers of Mar26 96.625/96.8125 2\u00d71 call spreads and 96.625/96.75 call spreads.

This development, reminiscent of pressures seen at the end of October 2024, reflects a gradual normalization of funding conditions after years of abnormally stable rates driven by abundant liquidity. According to Sam Zief, global macro strategist at J.P. Morgan Private Bank, the current environment suggests liquidity is no longer 'ample' and small shifts in supply and demand are causing more visible volatility. Strategists at TD Securities warn that reserves may now be 'scratching the surface of ample,' raising the risk that the Federal Reserve will need to intervene through reserve management purchases\u2014such as buying Treasury bills\u2014to inject liquidity, potentially as early as January 2026. Deutsche Bank suggests the Fed could also adjust the Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB) rate to ease funding pressures, possibly as soon as next week or in the first quarter of 2026. Meanwhile, 1- and 2-month T-bill rates fell by 7 and 10 basis points respectively to 3.84% and 3.75%, reflecting slightly higher expectations for Fed rate cuts in December and January. Despite the funding market concerns, all three major U.S. stock indexes\u2014DJIA, SPX, and COMP\u2014closed with moderate gains. The Federal Reserve continues to monitor these markets closely due to their role as the 'indoor plumbing' of the financial system and the risk of broader market disruptions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 02, 2025 09:26 PM\nSource:[Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20251202103/the-fed-may-need-to-act-as-potential-trouble-brews-in-a-key-corner-of-the-financial-market)\n\n**Stability Returns to Funding Markets as Repo Rates Decline**\nFunding markets are showing signs of stabilization after the volatility seen in October 2025. Key overnight repurchase agreement (repo) rates, including the Secured Overnight Financing Rate (SOFR), have declined to 3.91%, down from 4.0% the previous day. The Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB) is at 3.9%, reducing the spread between SOFR and IORB to just 1 basis point\u2014the smallest since October 20. Additionally, the Tri-Party General Collateral Rate and the Broad General Collateral Rate both dropped from 3.98% to 3.88%, marking the first time since October 20 that these benchmarks fell below the Federal Reserve's administered rates by 2 basis points. These developments indicate a return to stability in short-term funding markets, according to data from the New York Federal Reserve.

This rise is the highest daily movement since the Federal Reserve's last rate hike cycle and the largest since March 2020. The spike widened the spread between SOFR and the effective federal funds rate to 35 basis points, the highest level since 2020. SOFR also exceeded the Interest on Reserve Balances (IORB) rate by 32 basis points, the largest gap since 2020. The increase was driven by heightened demand for funds at month-end, which overwhelmed supply. Analysts suggest this volatility may ease after the Federal Reserve pauses its balance sheet reduction next month. (Source: Yahoo!
