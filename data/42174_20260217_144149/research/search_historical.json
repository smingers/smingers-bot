(FRED SOFR series, accessed 16 February 2026)\n\nScheduled FOMC meetings and policy actions still in force before 26 February 2026\n\nThe Federal Open Market Committee sets its calendar a year in advance (Federal Reserve \u201cMeeting calendars and information\u201d, federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/fomccalendars.htm). Between 1 December 2025 and 26 February 2026 the only regularly scheduled policy meetings were:\n\n\u2022 28-29 October 2025  \n\u2022 9-10 December 2025  \n\u2022 27-28 January 2026\n\nThe next regular meeting is 17-18 March 2026, after the target date in question.\n\nPolicy outcomes to date\n\n\u2022 10 December 2025 \u2013 Target range for the federal-funds rate lowered 25 bp to 3.50 %\u20133.75 % (Equals Money explainer summarising the FOMC statement, equalsmoney.com/economic-calendar/events/fomc-meeting).  \n\u2022 28 January 2026 \u2013 Target range left unchanged at 3.50 %\u20133.75 % (J.P. Morgan Wealth Management post-meeting commentary dated 29 Jan 2026). No balance-sheet or standing-facility changes were announced.  \n\nSince the January meeting there are no emergency sessions, minutes addenda, or implementation-note changes listed on the Federal Reserve\u2019s official calendar through 15 February 2026 (Federal Reserve Calendar, federalreserve.gov/newsevents/calendar.htm). Therefore, barring an unscheduled meeting, the stance set on 10 December 2025 and affirmed on 28 January 2026 will remain in effect on 26 February 2026.\n\nKey take-aways for the forecasting problem\n\n1. All SOFR observations that exist today have been provided above; data for 14\u201326 February 2026 are not yet available anywhere because those business days have not occurred.  \n2. No further scheduled FOMC meetings or policy-rate decisions fall between the last published SOFR (13 February 2026) and the target date (26 February 2026).  \n3. Consequently, unless the Federal Reserve convenes an unscheduled meeting, the policy environment that will guide SOFR on 26 February 2026 is the one announced on 10 December 2025 and left unchanged on 28 January 2026.  \n4. The value that will ultimately appear on FRED for 26 February 2026 will only be known once the New York Fed publishes that day\u2019s SOFR fixing at approximately 8:00 a.m. ET on 27 February 2026 and FRED ingests it shortly thereafter.\n\nRemaining information gap\n\n\u2022 The actual SOFR fixing for 26 February 2026 (and for any intervening business day beginning 14 February 2026) is not yet published; it will fill automatically on FRED after those dates arrive.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"SOFR\" query=\"SOFR\">\nFRED Economic Data: Secured Overnight Financing Rate\nSeries ID: SOFR\nUnits: Percent\nFrequency: Daily\nLatest observation: 3.66 (2026-02-13)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=4.16, min=3.63, max=4.51\n- 5-year: mean=3.30, min=0.01, max=5.40\n- 10-year: mean=2.61, min=0.01, max=5.40\n- All-time: mean=2.61, min=0.01, max=5.40 (since 2018-04-03)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: +0.02 (+0.5%)\n- 3-month change: -0.29 (-7.3%)\n- 6-month change: -0.70 (-16.1%)\n- Year-over-year: 3.66 vs 4.33 (-15.5%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-29,3.65\n2026-01-30,3.68\n2026-02-02,3.69\n2026-02-03,3.69\n2026-02-04,3.65\n2026-02-05,3.65\n2026-02-06,3.64\n2026-02-09,3.63\n2026-02-10,3.65\n2026-02-11,3.65\n2026-02-12,3.65\n2026-02-13,3.66\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
