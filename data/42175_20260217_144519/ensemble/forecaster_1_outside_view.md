## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **SpaceX Starship test milestones in 2024-2026**
   - Suitability: High. Direct program history.
   - Pattern: Mixed results with delays common. Flight 11 had "1 partial failure."
   - Timeline slippage: Original March 2025 target → "sometime in 2026"

2. **First-time orbital refueling demonstrations (any organization)**
   - Suitability: Medium-Low. Very limited precedent; never done at this scale.
   - Pattern: Insufficient data for meaningful reference class.

3. **SpaceX meeting announced annual milestones**
   - Suitability: High. SpaceX has history of ambitious timelines.
   - Pattern: SpaceX frequently announces aggressive targets and experiences delays, though eventually achieves goals.

4. **Complex space operations requiring multiple launches and orbital operations**
   - Suitability: Medium. Relevant for technical complexity assessment.
   - Pattern: High failure rates for first attempts; multiple test campaigns typically needed.

**Selected reference class:** SpaceX Starship test milestones in 2024-2026, supplemented by SpaceX's general pattern of meeting announced annual milestones.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 10 days (Feb 17 → Feb 26, 2026)

**Question structure:** Will the Metaculus community prediction rise above 40% in 10 days?

**Current status (Feb 16, 2026):**
- Community prediction: exactly 40%
- Question asks if it will be "higher than 40.00%" on Feb 26

**Historical patterns:**
- Timeline has already slipped from March 2025 → "sometime in 2026"
- As of early February 2026, no specific launch date announced
- Ars Technica (credible space journalism) assessed 50% probability for 2026 success (Jan 7, 2026)
- Current Metaculus probability (40%) is below Ars Technica's assessment
- Artemis II experiencing delays and technical issues, increasing pressure

**What could move the probability up in 10 days:**
- SpaceX announces specific launch dates for refueling demo
- Successful Starship test flight
- Positive technical updates from SpaceX
- Artemis II successful launch (scheduled March 6, but after Feb 26)

**What could move the probability down:**
- Starship test failure
- SpaceX announces further delays
- Additional technical issues revealed
- No news (status quo bias might keep it at 40%)

## (d) Justification

The meta-question asks whether forecasters will update their beliefs upward from the current 40% baseline within 10 days.

**Key considerations:**

1. **Anchoring effect:** The probability is currently exactly at the threshold (40%). Small movements are decisive.

2. **Information asymmetry:** The 10-day window is short. Major updates require:
   - SpaceX announcements (possible but not guaranteed)
   - Successful test flights (none scheduled in this window based on available info)
   - Technical revelations (unpredictable)

3. **Expert tethering:** Ars Technica's 50% assessment (Jan 7) suggests the "true" probability may be higher than current 40%, creating upward pressure.

4. **Recent trends:** 
   - NASA programs experiencing delays (Artemis II)
   - No specific 2026 launch dates announced yet for refueling demo
   - SpaceX described as "behind schedule" by NASA officials (Nov 2025)

5. **Status quo bias:** In absence of major news, Metaculus probabilities tend to be sticky. With only 10 days and no scheduled events, the probability may remain near 40%.

6. **Directional uncertainty:** While the "true" probability might be ~50% (per Ars Technica), the question is whether forecasters will update upward in 10 days, not whether the event will occur.

Outside view calibration:

**Tethering points:**
- Current probability: 40%
- Ars Technica expert assessment: 50% (as of Jan 7, 2026)
- Gap: 10 percentage points

**Calibration factors:**

1. **Short timeframe (10 days):** Limits information flow. Major updates are possible but not highly probable in such a short window.

2. **No scheduled catalysts:** No Starship launches or major announcements scheduled in the Feb 17-26 window based on available information.

3. **Upward pressure exists:** The gap between current 40% and expert assessment of 50% suggests room for upward movement if any positive information emerges.

4. **Threshold precision:** The question asks for "higher than 40.00%" - even 40.01% would resolve Yes. This is a knife-edge situation.

5. **Historical volatility:** Metaculus probabilities on SpaceX questions can move 5-10 percentage points on significant news, but typically remain stable absent major updates.

6. **Base rate for small movements:** In a 10-day window with no scheduled events, the probability of crossing a threshold you're currently sitting on is roughly symmetric - could go up or down with similar likelihood.

**Upset rate consideration:** Space industry timelines frequently slip, but Metaculus forecasters are generally aware of this. The current 40% already incorporates skepticism about SpaceX timelines.

**Probability assessment:**
- Probability of positive news in 10 days: ~20-30%
- Probability such news moves forecast above 40%: ~60-70%
- Combined: ~15-20%

However, there's also:
- Small probability of negative news: ~10-15%
- Probability negative news moves forecast below 40%: ~50-60%
- Combined downward: ~6-9%

Net upward pressure: ~9-14%

Given the knife-edge position at exactly 40%, any movement matters. The Ars Technica assessment suggests latent upward pressure, but the short timeframe limits realization of that pressure.
