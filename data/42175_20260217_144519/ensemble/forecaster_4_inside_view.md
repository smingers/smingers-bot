Analysis:

1. Source analysis (quality, date, fact vs. opinion – abridged to the items that plausibly move the Metaculus crowd within the next nine days)

• USA TODAY, 4 Nov 2025 – Main-stream US outlet quoting NASA/SpaceX. Factual: SpaceX publicly ties a 2026 orbital-refuelling demo to its Artemis contract. No brand-new information for Feb 2026, so limited near-term impact. Quality: high. Evidence weight: moderate (reinforces “still on for 2026”).

• Drive Tesla, 31 Oct 2025 – Secondary tech site summarising the same “simplified mission architecture” press call. Adds no fresh 2026 details. Quality: medium. Evidence weight: weak-moderate (corroborates the above).

• Ars Technica, 7 Jan 2026 – Reputable space reporter Eric Berger estimates “≈50 % chance the demo happens in 2026”. Opinion from an identifiable expert; quality: high. Evidence weight: moderate (gives forecasters a higher anchor than 40 %).

• Programming-Helper Tech, 26 Jan 2026 – Blog-style but cites NASA docs confirming the 2024 in-tank transfer and that the two-ship demo “passed a flight system review”. Some facts, some hype. Quality: low-medium. Evidence weight: weak (positive, but not decisive).

• India Today, 17 Feb 2026 – Reports a successful pad deluge test for Flight 12 (early-March launch). Fact: continuous incremental progress at Starbase. Quality: medium. Evidence weight: weak-moderate (fresh evidence of momentum; could trigger small optimism).

• Habr opinion piece, 16 Feb 2026 – Claims Starship is failing and SpaceX will pivot to Falcon Heavy. Lacks primary sourcing, mostly commentary. Quality: low. Evidence weight: weak (negative sentiment but unlikely to sway Metaculus regulars).

• NASASpaceFlight launch-cadence article, 16 Feb 2026 – Confirms brisk Falcon 9 ops and Starship pad preparations. Fact. Quality: high. Evidence weight: weak (ambient “SpaceX executing” signal).

Collectively, there is no binary-flipping headline; information is incremental and slightly positive-skewed.

2. Evidence analysis (strength tags)

• Orbital refuelling still formally scheduled for 2026 in SpaceX/NASA documentation – moderate evidence, positive.

• Expert (Berger) publicly assigns ≈50 % probability – moderate evidence, positive.

• Visible Starbase progress (pad test, imminent Flight 12) – weak-moderate evidence, positive.

• Critical opinion pieces alleging Starship failure – weak evidence, negative.

Net evidence tilt: small upward pressure on the underlying event probability; therefore mild upward pressure on the Metaculus community prediction.

3. Timeframe analysis

Days until judgement: 9.  
Typical 1-week Metaculus drift for an active, non-closing aerospace question: 0–3 pp unless a salient news bomb drops. The most likely mechanisms for a >0 pp move are  
a) a single persuasive community post,  
b) a mini-wave of new forecasts after Flight 12 static-fire / FAA approval news.  
If the horizon were halved to 4-5 days, probability of a >0 pp rise drops ~5 pp (less time for new information); if doubled to 18 days, add ~6 pp (more opportunities for small positive bumps).

4. Justification / inside-view shift

Outside-view baseline: 44 % (derived from historical Metaculus short-run symmetry, then penalised 3 pp for “strictly greater than” tie risk).

Adjustments:

+2 pp Fresh, mildly bullish news cycle after the 17 Feb pad test may prompt small optimism.  
+1 pp Flight 12 static-fire or FAA approval could occur before 26 Feb, another nudge upward.  
−1 pp Stickiness/rounding: CP often stays at round numbers unless ≥2–3 new forecasts move the weighted median.  
Net shift: +2 pp → 46 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that 46 out of 100 times, the Metaculus community prediction at 12:35 UTC on 26 Feb 2026 will read strictly greater than 40 %.”

Checklist:

1. Restated question: Will the Metaculus community prediction for “Starship refuels in orbit during 2026” exceed 40 % at noon-thirty-five UTC on 26 Feb 2026?  
2. Outside-view base: 44 %.  
3. Consistency line: “46 out of 100 times … happens.”  
4. Key evidence (≤20 w each):  
   a) Ars Technica 50 % expert estimate published Jan 2026.  
   b) SpaceX/NASA docs still list 2026 demo milestone.  
   c) Ongoing visible hardware progress (pad deluge, Flight 12 prep).  
   d) No negative milestone or slip announced since Jan.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden FAA/engine-test failure within next week could drop CP below 35 %.  
6. Status-quo inertia favours “No”; I applied a modest +2 pp only where news justifies.

Probability: 46%
