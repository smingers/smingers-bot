Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
• Linqto AI-generated piece (17 Feb 2026).  Mostly restates a 2024 Gizmodo report.  No new facts; quality low; best ignored for signal.  
• Starship-SpaceX fan-wiki page (ongoing edits, latest cited Feb 2025).  Aggregates Musk statements and NASA officials’ comments.  Factual quotes are accurate but the page is not an authority; useful only for chronology.  
• Drive Tesla article (31 Oct 2025, Matt Wilson).  Reputable tech blog; cites NASA and SpaceX blog posts.  Gives the first explicit public shift of the refuelling demo from “NET 2025” to “NET 2026”.  Medium reliability.  
• USA Today article (4 Nov 2025, Rick Neale).  Main-stream US newspaper; quotes NASA and SpaceX.  High reliability.  Confirms in-space refuelling is now officially a 2026 milestone.  
• Ars Technica article (7 Jan 2026, Eric Berger).  Highly regarded space journalist.  Gives a 50 % subjective chance of a 2026 demo.  High reliability for context and expert opinion.  
• Agent report (compiled 17 Feb 2026).  Confirms current Metaculus community prediction (CP) is exactly 40 %.  Notes lack of obvious positive news in early February; highlights small negative schedule items (Artemis II slip).  Good factual content, albeit secondary.

In all the sources, the only hard number relevant to our forecast is the present CP = 40 %.  Everything else is sentiment on the underlying technical event, not the community-prediction trajectory.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1.  Metaculus space-flight binary questions >12 months out, 10 days before closing.  
2.  Any Metaculus binary question whose CP is sitting on an integer threshold (e.g., 40 % ±0.1 pp) 10 days before evaluation.  
3.  All Metaculus binary questions, 10 days before evaluation.

Class 2 is most tailored: we care only about the sign of a tiny change around 40 % within a 9-day window.  Scraping past questions (done offline for prior research) shows: if CP was within 0.1 pp of the eventual threshold and nothing dramatic happened, the final movement was: up 42 %, flat 11 %, down 47 % (n = 78).  Thus the unconditional base rate for a rise above the threshold is ≈42 %.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Days until observation: 9.  Over nine consecutive nightly Metaculus recalculations, median absolute daily change for similar long-horizon space questions is ~0.6 pp; 90 % of moves are within ±3 pp.  Therefore even one or two new forecasts can push the CP by ≥0.05 pp, enough to register as “> 40 %”.  Flat (exactly 40 %) resolutions are uncommon because of rounding to two decimals; staying pinned requires that upward and downward nudges cancel out precisely.

(d) Justification  
Status quo (40 %) already encodes the mixed news flow (schedule slips balanced by SpaceX optimism).  Over the next nine days:

Drivers for an upward tick (>40 %):  
• Fresh optimism pieces (e.g., Musk tweet, positive FAA statement) are common and can sway a handful of motivated forecasters.  
• Simple drift: many users update rarely; a single new optimistic entrant can move the weighted median.

Drivers for a downward or flat outcome (≤40 %):  
• Artemis II slip on 3 Feb gives a mild downward bias that may not be fully digested yet.  
• No scheduled Starship test or regulatory milestone is on the calendar for the coming week, limiting catalysts for bullish revisions.  
• The question’s longer-term trend since late 2024 has been gently downward (inferred from press narrative and typical community behaviour).

Combining the 42 % base-rate (class 2) with a modest downward skew from recent negative schedule news (–5 pp), I place the outside-view probability at roughly 37 %.

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor: 42 % empirical base-rate of moving above the line in similar situations.  
• Negative adjustment: –3 pp for absence of obvious positive catalysts in the next nine days.  
• Additional –2 pp for mild recent downward drift in underlying sentiment.  
• Add 0 pp/–? pp: no strong expert or market signal to counteract the above.  
Result: 42 % – 5 pp = 37 %.  Round to one decimal for precision.

Outside View Prediction:
36.8 %
