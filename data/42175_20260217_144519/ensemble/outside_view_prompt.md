- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41142
- Original question title: Will SpaceX successfully refuel a Starship in orbit during 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 40.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as **Yes** if SpaceX successfully transfers at least 1 metric ton of propellant from one Starship to another while both are in Earth orbit during 2026.

Original fine print: 
> * If no official numbers are published, estimates from [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) will be used to resolve this question. Estimates described as "approximately a ton" or similar will qualify. If no credible estimates exist, this question will resolve as **Yes** if NASA or SpaceX describe the propellant transfer as successful.
> * This question will not resolve as **Yes** if, before either vehicle begins its planned landing or deorbit, either Starship is severely damaged, loses control, or is otherwise declared a loss by SpaceX or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).

Original background: 
> The [Starship Propellant Transfer Demonstration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Propellant_Transfer_Demonstration) is a planned demonstration of the capacity to refuel a [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_\(spacecraft\)) rocket using another while in orbit of Earth.&#x20;
> 
> Scheduled to take place during mid-2026, the mission is critical for [Artemis Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program) as the program requires refueling in order to reach the moon.
> 
> SpaceX has had [mixed results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Starship_launches) during past launches, with their most recent test, [Flight 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_flight_test_11), successfully splashing down with only 1 partial failure.

<Agent_report>
Query: Fetch Metaculus question 41142: current probability, change history since Jan 2025, and top February 2026 comments citing schedule or technical risk. Also list external events those comments reference.
1. Current community prediction (Metaculus Q #41142)  
   • The only machine–readable value surfaced in the material is contained in the Metaculus API stub   
     {"post_id":41142,…"last_cp":0.4}. 0.4 corresponds to 40 %.  
   • This matches the narrative statement in the context: “The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 40.00 %.”  
   → Current probability: 40 % as of 16 Feb 2026.

2. Change-history of the community prediction (Jan 2025 → Feb 2026)  
   No time-series points or chart data were returned in the search results; therefore a month-by-month or inflection-point history cannot be reconstructed from the information provided.  This is a material information gap.

3. February 2026 Metaculus comment activity dealing with schedule or technical risk  
   • No Metaculus comment pages were retrieved; consequently, direct quotations, “agree” counts, or timestamps cannot be presented.  
   • Nevertheless, external events in early February 2026 that forecasters would almost certainly have cited when discussing schedule or technical risk are documented in the news coverage gathered:

     a) Artemis II wet-dress-rehearsal failure and launch slip  
        – Hydrogen leak in SLS core stage triggered NASA to move the earliest launch date from February to 6 March 2026 (Houston Public Media, 3 Feb 2026; NPR, 3 Feb 2026).  
        – Engineers also reported Orion-hatch valve issues, camera malfunctions in cold weather, and comms dropouts.  
        – NASA officials publicly stressed that further delays were possible if the retest failed.  
        – Relevance: Artemis III (targeted NET 2027) depends on a chain that includes a successful Artemis II and the Starship in-orbit refuelling demo; slippage increases schedule pressure on SpaceX.

     b) Cold-weather-driven postponement of Artemis-related SLS tanking test (Spaceflight Now, 30 Jan 2026).  
        – The same arctic outbreak caused NASA to defer the SLS tanking test and compress February launch opportunities.  
        – Relevance: Reinforces schedule uncertainty and illustrates how exogenous weather can derail critical-path tests.

   • Given that Metaculus forecasters routinely fold Artemis milestones into their Starship refuelling probabilities, these NASA slips are the most likely external events referenced in February 2026 comment threads about “schedule risk” and “technical risk”.

4. External events likely referenced in February 2026 comments (consolidated list)  
   • 3 Feb 2026: NASA delays Artemis II to March because of hydrogen leak and other anomalies (Houston Public Media; NPR).  
   • 30 Jan 2026: SLS wet-dress rehearsal and earliest Artemis II launch opportunity slip due to cold weather (Spaceflight Now).  
   • Any subsequent success/failure of the re-run wet-dress rehearsal (not yet reported by the cut-off date 16 Feb 2026) would be watched closely, but no definitive outcome is in the supplied sources.

5. Information gaps remaining  
   • Continuous probability history from 1 Jan 2025 onward (specific dates/values).  
   • Text and metadata of Metaculus comments posted in Feb 2026 that explicitly cite schedule or technical risk and the number of “likes/agreements” that make them “top” comments.

Without the Metaculus API calls for /questions/41142/comments or /questions/41142/prediction-history, those two items cannot be completed.</Agent_report>
