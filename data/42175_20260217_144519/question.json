    "description": "Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41142\n- Original question title: Will SpaceX successfully refuel a Starship in orbit during 2026?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 40.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> This question will resolve as **Yes** if SpaceX successfully transfers at least 1 metric ton of propellant from one Starship to another while both are in Earth orbit during 2026.\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> * If no official numbers are published, estimates from [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) will be used to resolve this question. Estimates described as \"approximately a ton\" or similar will qualify. If no credible estimates exist, this question will resolve as **Yes** if NASA or SpaceX describe the propellant transfer as successful.\n> * This question will not resolve as **Yes** if, before either vehicle begins its planned landing or deorbit, either Starship is severely damaged, loses control, or is otherwise declared a loss by SpaceX or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).\n\nOriginal background: \n> The [Starship Propellant Transfer Demonstration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Propellant_Transfer_Demonstration) is a planned demonstration of the capacity to refuel a [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_\\(spacecraft\\)) rocket using another while in orbit of Earth.&#x20;\n> \n> Scheduled to take place during mid-2026, the mission is critical for [Artemis Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program) as the program requires refueling in order to reach the moon.\n> \n> SpaceX has had [mixed results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Starship_launches) during past launches, with their most recent test, [Flight 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_flight_test_11), successfully splashing down with only 1 partial failure.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41142,\"question_id\":40843,\"last_cp\":0.4}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41142) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-26 12:35:23 is higher than 40.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 40.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-26 12:35:23, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.",
