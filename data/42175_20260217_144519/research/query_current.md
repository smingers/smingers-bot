Analysis:
To judge whether Metaculus users will raise their probability above 40 % during the next nine days, I need very up-to-date signals about (1) SpaceX’s technical progress toward in-orbit propellant transfer, (2) NASA’s milestone reviews and funding decisions on the Starship Propellant Transfer Demonstration, (3) the cadence and outcomes of recent Starship flight tests, and (4) any credible schedule changes for Artemis III/IV that depend on refueling. Fresh reporting on engine/thermal issues, tank-to-tank transfer tests, regulatory approvals, or new contracts could quickly shift community sentiment. Therefore the most relevant news will be late-January to mid-February 2026 aerospace and NASA coverage, SpaceX press releases, and analyst commentary.
