The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 40.00% on 2026-02-26 for the Metaculus question "Will SpaceX successfully refuel a Starship in orbit during 2026?"?

Question background:
Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency.

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41142
- Original question title: Will SpaceX successfully refuel a Starship in orbit during 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 40.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as **Yes** if SpaceX successfully transfers at least 1 metric ton of propellant from one Starship to another while both are in Earth orbit during 2026.

Original fine print: 
> * If no official numbers are published, estimates from [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions) will be used to resolve this question. Estimates described as "approximately a ton" or similar will qualify. If no credible estimates exist, this question will resolve as **Yes** if NASA or SpaceX describe the propellant transfer as successful.
> * This question will not resolve as **Yes** if, before either vehicle begins its planned landing or deorbit, either Starship is severely damaged, loses control, or is otherwise declared a loss by SpaceX or other [credible sources](https://www.metaculus.com/faq/#definitions).

Original background: 
> The [Starship Propellant Transfer Demonstration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_Propellant_Transfer_Demonstration) is a planned demonstration of the capacity to refuel a [Starship](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SpaceX_Starship_\(spacecraft\)) rocket using another while in orbit of Earth.&#x20;
> 
> Scheduled to take place during mid-2026, the mission is critical for [Artemis Program](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_program) as the program requires refueling in order to reach the moon.
> 
> SpaceX has had [mixed results](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Starship_launches) during past launches, with their most recent test, [Flight 11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Starship_flight_test_11), successfully splashing down with only 1 partial failure.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41142) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-26 12:35:23 is higher than 40.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 40.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-26 12:35:23, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-17. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-17 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find current news relevant to the question. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or AskNews.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For AskNews:
AskNews supports natural language. Write a query of up to two sentences, specifying relevant scope (e.g., geography, industry, time period). Avoid ambiguous acronyms.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one AskNews query.
