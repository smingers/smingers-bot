Analysis:
To judge whether the Metaculus community probability will drift above 40 % in the next nine days, the best outside‐view references are:
• SpaceX’s recent technical progress on Starship/Ship-to-Ship propellant transfer (hardware developments, NASA contract milestones, test flight results, stated schedules).  
• NASA statements, contract documentation, and GAO/IG schedule assessments for the Artemis Human Landing System, because the demo is a prerequisite and timing driver.  
• Any slips, failures, or breakthroughs reported in the last few weeks that could plausibly swing sentiment.  
• Inside-Metaculus dynamics: probability history for question #41142, major comment threads, and notable forecaster rationales in February 2026.
