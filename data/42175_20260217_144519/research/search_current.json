How Musk Plans to Transport Humanity to Space via AI Satellites**\nElon Musk's SpaceX is pursuing a strategic shift from Mars-focused missions to building orbital data centers powered by AI satellites, aiming to generate hundreds of billions in revenue to fund future space colonization. The company has requested approval from U.S. authorities to launch up to one million satellites, with Musk asserting that these orbital data centers\u2014enabled by Starship\u2019s reduced launch costs (targeting $50/kg) and solar-powered operation on dawn-dusk orbits\u2014will become a primary source of funding. These orbits offer 85% continuous sunlight, enabling near-constant power generation, while cooling challenges are addressed via microfluidic systems using synthetic oils to manage GPU heat at 370 K (+97\u00b0C), reducing radiator mass by over half. Musk also envisions a lunar base with a mass driver to launch satellites, minimizing Earth-based launch pollution. However, technical hurdles remain: lunar dust abrasiveness, radiation exposure, and the feasibility of in-situ manufacturing from regolith. Despite the ambitious vision, risks include the unproven commercial viability of AI data centers\u2014xAI, SpaceX\u2019s AI arm, reported losses of $13 billion in 2025\u2014and the possibility that AI-driven infrastructure may not deliver the expected returns. The article concludes that while the plan could revolutionize space funding, its success hinges on uncertain AI market growth and technical execution, with no other major player currently capable of advancing human interplanetary expansion.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 12:00 PM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0440](https://habr.com/ru/companies/ru_mts/articles/996132/)\n\n**Watch: Water explosion at SpaceX base. It's a good sign for Elon Musk**\nSpaceX conducted a full-duration water deluge system test at Starbase Orbital Launch Pad 2 in Boca Chica, Texas, on February 17, 2026, as part of preparations for Starship Flight 12, targeted for early March 2026. The test, which involved massive water columns erupting from the flame trench at full strength, simulated the conditions of the Super Heavy booster's 33 Raptor engines firing, generating nearly 17 million pounds of thrust. This system protects the launch pad from extreme heat, acoustics, and thrust, addressing damage previously sustained at Pad 1. The test supports Booster 19, currently undergoing cryogenic proof testing, and Ship 39, forming the first Block 3 Starship stack. The upgraded Version 3 (V3) vehicle features Raptor V3 engines, enhanced heat shields, and a slightly stretched structure to carry heavier payloads. Elon Musk confirmed the tentative launch window depends on the integration of Booster 19 and Ship 39, with no spacecraft payload announced. The test increases the likelihood of FAA approval for the March 2026 launch and signals faster-than-expected progress. SpaceX aims for a higher launch cadence in 2026, potentially shifting operations to Florida barge trials. The deluge system, capable of releasing up to 350,000 gallons of water, supports the long-term goal of reusability for Mars exploration and NASA Artemis contracts. Musk emphasized that the test is a critical step toward orbital refueling demonstrations and future deep-space missions. The Starship stack, previously seen ascending in a prior test, underscores the rocket\u2019s power and the scale of infrastructure upgrades at Starbase.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 08:44 AM\nSource:[India Today](https://www.indiatoday.in/science/story/watch-water-explosion-at-spacex-base-its-a-good-sign-for-elon-musk-2869586-2026-02-17)\n\n**Starlink Group to Exceed 10,000 Satellites by March 2026**\nSpaceX is preparing to exceed 10,000 Starlink satellites in orbit by the first half of March 2026. As of now, the Starlink service supports over 10 million active users across approximately 160 countries and territories. In 2025, SpaceX maintained an impressive launch rate of over 70 satellites per week on average. Later in 2026, the first Starlink Version 3 satellites are expected to be deployed on the Starship rocket, offering gigabit-speed connectivity and increasing the network\u2019s capacity by 20 times\u2014marking a critical step toward global high-speed internet expansion.

The first Falcon 9 launch, Starlink Group 6-103, occurred on February 16 from Cape Canaveral Space Force Station (CCSFS), deploying 29 Starlink v2 Mini satellites into a 257 by 271-km orbit inclined at 43 degrees. Booster B1090, on its 10th mission, landed on the A Shortfall of Gravitas droneship. The second launch, Starlink Group 10-36, took place on February 18 from SLC-40, with booster B1077 (27th flight) deploying 29 satellites into a 53.16-degree orbit. The third mission, Starlink Group 17-25, launched on February 19 from Vandenberg Space Force Base (VSFB), placing 25 satellites into a 97.29-degree orbit; booster B1063, on its 31st mission, landed on Of Course I Still Love You in the Pacific. Firefly Aerospace returned its Alpha rocket to flight with the FLTA007 'Stairway to Seven' mission on February 20 from SLC-2W at VSFB, testing systems in shadow mode for the upcoming Alpha Block II, which will feature a longer length, improved fuel tanks, and in-house avionics. The mission was uncrewed and aimed at validating thermal and structural improvements after the failed FLTA006 mission and a subsequent engine combustion anomaly in September 2025. Falcon 9's Starlink Group 6-104 launch on February 21 set a record with booster B1067 achieving 33 flights, deploying 28 satellites into a 43-degree orbit. The final mission, Starlink Group 17-26, launched on February 22 from SLC-4E, deploying 25 satellites into a 97.29-degree orbit with booster B1093. SpaceX also announced it now has 10 million Starlink subscribers, and Southwest Airlines will soon offer Starlink Wi-Fi on many of its aircraft.

While the Hohmann transfer window to Mars opens only every 26 months and Starship missions take six to nine months, lunar launch windows occur twice monthly and trips take less than a week. This allows for faster iteration and testing\u2014SpaceX\u2019s core strength. SpaceX plans to build a self-growing lunar city within 10 years, a timeline significantly shorter than the 20+ years projected for Mars. Orbital refueling, essential for large-scale missions, remains unachieved but is targeted for 2026. The article notes that nuclear propulsion, which could halve Mars transit time, is underfunded in NASA\u2019s 2026 budget despite successful 2025 tests. The author suggests that SpaceX, with Elon Musk\u2019s influence and a potentially more flexible regulatory environment under a Trump administration, could pioneer nuclear propulsion programs currently stalled at NASA. The piece concludes with the idea that delaying Mars missions in favor of lunar development may ultimately enable faster, more sustainable human presence on Mars. According to the author, Musk\u2019s 2022 statement that SpaceX 'specializes at converting the impossible to late' may reflect this long-term strategy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:46 PM\nSource:[PJ Media](https://pjmedia.com/vodkapundit/2026/02/16/maybe-the-shortest-path-to-mars-requires-a-240000-mile-detour-n4949556)\n\n**$10 Billion on Starship in Vain: SpaceX Returns to Falcon Heavy for Lunar Colonies**\nElon Musk's SpaceX, once focused exclusively on establishing a self-sustaining city on Mars using the Starship program, has reportedly shifted its strategic focus to building a lunar base using the Falcon Heavy rocket. This reversal comes amid serious technical challenges facing Starship, including its inability to achieve the promised 100\u2013150 ton payload to low Earth orbit (LEO), with current performance limited to only 20 tons on suborbital trajectories. Starship also suffers from poor reliability\u2014over half of its launch attempts have failed\u2014and faces critical issues with fuel boil-off in space due to cryogenic methane and oxygen, making orbital refueling impractical. Even with repeated refueling missions, Starship would never reach full fuel capacity due to daily fuel loss from solar heating. A hypothetical lunar base requiring six 10.2-ton modules could be delivered to lunar orbit in just three partially reusable Falcon Heavy launches, costing approximately $741 million\u2014less than half the cost of a single NASA SLS launch. Falcon Heavy, with 100% launch success rate and proven integration with spacecraft, offers a viable, low-risk, and cost-effective alternative for lunar missions. The author argues that SpaceX may have spent over $10 billion on Starship development, money that could have instead been used to build a lunar base using existing Falcon Heavy capabilities. The shift to the Moon, while undermining Musk\u2019s long-promoted Mars narrative, allows SpaceX to maintain its vision of off-world settlements and investor confidence ahead of its anticipated IPO. This strategic pivot represents a major recalibration of SpaceX\u2019s ambitions, acknowledging the current limitations of Starship while preserving the broader narrative of human expansion beyond Earth.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 04:45 PM\nSource:[\u0425\u0430\u0431\u0440](https://habr.com/ru/companies/bothub/articles/996998/)\n\n**Double delivery: SpaceX sends Starlink satellites into orbit on launches from California and Florida**\nSpaceX successfully launched two Falcon 9 rockets within 48 hours, delivering a total of 53 Starlink satellites to orbit. The first launch occurred on Saturday, February 14, 2026, at 8:59 p.m. EST (0159 GMT on February 15) from Space Launch Complex 4E at Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, carrying 24 satellites (Group 17-13). The second launch took place on Monday, February 16, 2026, at 2:59 a.m. EST (0759 GMT) from Space Launch Complex 40 at Cape Canaveral Space Force Station in Florida, deploying 29 satellites (Group 6-103). Both missions were confirmed successful, with satellite deployment occurring approximately one hour after liftoff. The first stages of both rockets landed safely on drone ships: Booster 1081 touched down on 'Of Course I Still Love You' in the Pacific Ocean, completing its 22nd flight, and Booster 1090 landed on 'A Shortfall of Gravitas' in the Atlantic Ocean, marking its 10th reuse. The Starlink network, now comprising over 9,600 active satellites, provides broadband internet to underserved regions and supports cell-to-satellite communication and in-flight Wi-Fi on select carriers.

With AI infrastructure spending accounting for nearly a third of U.S. economic growth in Q2 2025, tech giants like Google (planning $185 billion in AI investments by 2026) and OpenAI are racing to secure power. Musk argues that space offers unlimited solar energy, making it the only viable long-term solution. SpaceX, with its reusable Falcon 9 rockets and the upcoming Starship, has drastically reduced launch costs\u2014from $55,000 per kg under the Space Shuttle era to under $3,000 today, and potentially as low as $200\u2013$20 per kg by 2035. SpaceX has already launched nearly 10,000 Starlink satellites and conducts over three launches per week. Other players, including Starcloud, Blue Origin, China\u2019s satellite constellation projects, and Thales Alenia in Europe, are also pursuing orbital computing. However, major challenges remain: radiation shielding, thermal management in a vacuum (requiring massive radiators), and the inability to repair hardware in space. Critics question Musk\u2019s timeline\u2014projecting a million satellites in three years\u2014but acknowledge SpaceX has repeatedly exceeded expectations. The U.S. electricity supply has stagnated while AI demand could increase power consumption from 4.4% to 12% by 2028, prompting companies like Google, Microsoft, and Meta to buy power long-term or acquire energy firms. With SpaceX preparing for an IPO, Musk\u2019s announcement may serve both strategic and promotional purposes. Though his three-year timeline is optimistic, SpaceX\u2019s track record suggests that while orbital data centers may not arrive by 2027, Musk remains the most credible contender to make them a reality.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 04:30 AM\nSource:[Neue Z\u00fcrcher Zeitung](https://www.nzz.ch/technologie/musks-kuehner-traum-von-serverfarmen-im-all-wenn-nicht-er-wer-sonst-ld.1924363)\n\n**Bezos Signals Lunar Race Challenge with Turtle Image, Pledging Blue Origin\u2019s Victory Through Persistence**\nJeff Bezos, founder of Amazon and Blue Origin, published a black-and-white image of a turtle emerging from shadow on platform X without any commentary, signaling a strategic declaration in the space race. The turtle symbolizes Blue Origin's core philosophy\u2014slow and steady wins the race\u2014inspired by Aesop's fable. Bezos believes Blue Origin can surpass SpaceX in returning humans to the Moon before 2030. This ambition stems from two challenges: SpaceX's repeated Starship prototype explosions in 2025, which undermined confidence in its timeline, and China's advancing lunar program, including the Long March 10 rocket and Mengzhou capsule test, aiming for a crewed Moon landing by 2030. Blue Origin is accelerating its lunar program by eliminating the need for orbital refueling\u2014a high-risk component of NASA's Artemis program\u2014through a new architecture requiring only three to four launches of the New Glenn rocket. A demonstration mission would involve two New Glenn launches carrying transfer modules to low Earth orbit, a third launching the Blue Moon MK2-IL lander to lunar orbit, where it would autonomously land and return. A crewed mission would add a fourth launch for rendezvous with NASA's Orion spacecraft at a halo orbit. Blue Origin has halted New Shepard flights to redirect all resources to New Glenn and lunar development. While Blue Origin lacks experience in deep-space docking and complex maneuvers, its strategy prioritizes simplicity and speed over payload capacity. SpaceX's Starship offers greater cargo and crew space but faces technical setbacks. With China, SpaceX, and Blue Origin now full participants in the Moon race, Bezos's turtle symbolizes his belief that persistence and consistency will prevail. The outcome will be determined before 2030.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 03:30 PM\nSource:[PurePC](https://www.purepc.pl/jeff-bezos-elon-ksiezyc-przyspieszenie-prac-musk-x-zolw-trolling-plan-pokonania-spacex)\n\n**Musk's lunar city plan supercharges America's return to the moon**\nElon Musk, CEO of SpaceX, announced on his social media platform X that SpaceX is shifting focus to building a self-growing city on the Moon, aiming to achieve it in less than 10 years\u2014faster than the projected 20+ years for a Mars city. Musk cited the ability to launch to the Moon every 10 days (2-day trip) versus every 26 months to Mars (6-month trip), enabling faster iteration. He emphasized that while Mars remains a long-term goal, the Moon is the priority for securing civilization\u2019s future. The lunar city, dubbed 'Moon Base Alpha,' would serve as a hub for mining, manufacturing, and launching orbital AI data centers via an electromagnetic mass driver, reducing launch costs due to the Moon\u2019s lower gravity. These data centers would be built on the Moon and powered by solar panels. Initial infrastructure, including mining equipment and habitats, would be launched from Earth, with Optimus robots expected to assist construction. The Moon\u2019s polar craters contain water ice and frozen carbon dioxide, which could be used to produce oxygen, hydrogen, and methane (via the Sabatier reaction) for Starship fuel. This could allow Starships to refuel in lunar orbit before heading to Mars, reducing mission costs. The plan aligns with NASA\u2019s Artemis program (Moon first, then Mars), potentially enabling NASA to rent space at the SpaceX base. The initiative could also catalyze a space-based industrial revolution and benefit companies like Blue Origin, which is developing lunar resource processing technologies. Musk\u2019s vision, though ambitious, is backed by his vast resources, especially with SpaceX\u2019s upcoming IPO. The article notes that despite past political failures by NASA to establish a lunar base, a South African immigrant may now make it a reality. The summary is supported by references to Mark R. Whittington\u2019s writings on space policy, including 'Why is America Going Back to the Moon?' and 'The Moon, Mars and Beyond.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 03:00 PM\nSource:[The Hill](https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/5737808-elon-musk-lunar-settlement/)\n\n**Starship: Musk Announces First Launch of World's Largest Rocket in 2026**\nElon Musk announced on social media platform X that SpaceX plans to conduct the first orbital test flight of the Starship V3 prototype during the second week of March 2026, marking the 12th test flight overall and a critical milestone for the program. The Starship V3 features an enlarged, reinforced structure to support greater payload capacity and longer missions, with key upgrades to thermal protection and propulsion systems for improved reliability during ascent and atmospheric reentry. Despite the announcement, internal SpaceX documents obtained by Politico indicate delays in the Artemis 3 lunar mission, now projected for September 2028\u2014later than NASA\u2019s official 2027 target. The company plans to conduct the first critical orbital refueling demonstration in June 2026, followed by a non-crewed lunar landing in June 2027, both essential prerequisites for crewed missions. SpaceX\u2019s long-term goal includes Mars colonization, which depends on mastering orbital refueling\u2014a technology still unproven at scale, with estimates ranging from 10 to 40 refueling flights per mission. The V3 prototype is central to this effort. Previous Starship flights in 2025 included a failed launch in January due to an undetected issue, a loss in March after uncontrolled spin and altitude loss, a general failure in May, a successful launch in August achieving all objectives including Starlink satellite deployment, and a second successful flight in October, with clean separation of the Super Heavy booster and a controlled ocean landing, alongside successful in-space tests including lateral satellite ejection. The next major goal is landing the Starship directly at Starbase for reuse, with design updates already implemented to support this objective.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 28, 2026 05:09 PM\nSource:[Olhar Digital - O futuro passa primeiro aqui](https://olhardigital.com.br/2026/01/28/ciencia-e-espaco/starship-musk-anuncia-primeiro-lancamento-do-maior-foguete-do-mundo-em-2026/)\n\n**Elon Musk and Mars: Is Starship Ready for the Impossible by 2026?**\nElon Musk has set a target of launching SpaceX's Starship to Mars by the end of 2026, a deadline driven by the critical planetary alignment known as Mars' opposition, which occurs only once every 26 months and opens a narrow window between mid-November and December 2026. Missing this window would require waiting until 2028. Despite significant progress\u2014such as successful controlled landings in August and October 2025\u2014SpaceX has faced setbacks, including the explosion of booster 18 during a ground test in late 2025, delaying development of the more powerful Starship v3 (Block 3). A major technical challenge remains: orbital refueling, which requires multiple launches to refuel the Starship in space before its interplanetary journey\u2014technology SpaceX has not yet fully mastered under real conditions. The program also faces pressure from NASA's Artemis III mission, which relies on Starship as a lunar lander and must succeed before China\u2019s 2030 lunar ambitions. With at least eight launches planned for 2026, even minor delays due to crashes, regulatory issues, or weather could jeopardize the Mars mission. While Musk's 2026 deadline is seen by some as a strategic marketing tool to maintain investor interest and accelerate development, its success would mark a historic milestone in space exploration; failure would add to the list of unfulfilled promises under 'Elon Time.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 09:32 AM\nSource:[01net](https://www.01net.com/?p=1319544)\n\n**SpaceX Plans Lunar Test Flight for Starship in 2026 Amid Orbital Refueling Challenge**\nSpaceX plans to conduct a test flight of its Starship rocket for a lunar mission in the first quarter of 2026, marking a critical year for the Starship program. The test follows a delay in the previous Starship launch due to damage to a Super Heavy booster from 'Version 3' of SpaceX's Raptor 3 engines, designed to improve performance. NASA has expressed concern over delays in the Artemis III lunar landing project, with acting NASA administrator Sean Duffy stating, 'I love SpaceX. It's an incredible company. The problem is they're falling behind. They set their own timelines, and we're racing against China.' SpaceX is striving to retain its contract for the Artemis III lunar lander, while also promoting Starship Version 3 as the first iteration capable of interplanetary travel, including missions to Mars. Elon Musk has indicated interest in launching an uncrewed mission to Mars during the next Earth-Mars alignment, but first, SpaceX must master orbital refueling\u2014a technology Musk calls 'essential to making life multiplanetary.' The article concludes that mastering orbital refueling in 2026 is crucial for both the Moon and Mars missions, as well as advancing humanity's space exploration. Meanwhile, in November of the previous year, Blue Origin successfully launched NASA's mission on its New Glenn rocket, returning the first stage to the ocean platform 'Jacklyn' in the Atlantic, marking the first successful recovery of the vehicle. The New Glenn is a two-stage heavy-lift launch vehicle developed by Blue Origin, founded by Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos, capable of delivering up to 45 metric tons to low Earth orbit.\nOriginal language: uk\nPublish date: January 07, 2026 05:37 PM\nSource:[unian](https://www.unian.ua/science/spacex-novini-kompaniya-planuye-viprobuvati-raketonosiy-dlya-podorozhi-na-misyac-13248873.html)\n\n**SpaceX launches Starship megarocket on successful test flight | African News Agency**\nSpaceX successfully launched its Starship megarocket on a test flight from Texas on October 14, 2025, marking a significant milestone in the company's development of the world\u2019s largest and most powerful rocket. The Super Heavy booster landed in the Gulf of Mexico as planned, while the Starship upper stage completed its mission, flying through space and releasing mock satellites before splashing down in the Indian Ocean over an hour after liftoff\u2014following a trajectory similar to the August 2025 successful flight. No recovery of the vehicle was planned. This test was expected to be the final one for the current Starship prototype iteration, with the next flight scheduled to debut Version 3. The mission follows a series of high-profile explosions in prior tests, including three upper-stage failures over the Caribbean and one during a ground test in June 2025. Despite these setbacks, SpaceX may now claim two consecutive successful flights. The Starship is central to NASA\u2019s Artemis program, which aims to return humans to the Moon, with the Artemis III mission targeted for mid-2027. However, a NASA safety advisory panel has warned the mission could be 'years late,' and former NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine stated that 'unless something changes, it is highly unlikely the United States will beat China\u2019s projected timeline'\u2014China targeting a crewed lunar landing by 2030. The US administration under President Donald Trump has increased pressure on NASA to accelerate progress, and SpaceX holds a multibillion-dollar federal contract to develop a lunar lander variant of Starship. Elon Musk emphasized the mission\u2019s significance, stating he chose to watch it live outside rather than in the control room for a 'more visceral' experience. Key technical challenges remain, including developing a fully reusable orbital heat shield\u2014Musk noted it took nine months to refurbish the Space Shuttle\u2019s heat shield\u2014and proving the ability to refuel Starship in orbit with super-cooled propellant, a critical step for deep-space missions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 12:42 PM\nSource:[africannewsagency.com](https://africannewsagency.com/spacex-launches-starship-megarocket-on-successful-test-flight/)\n\n**SpaceX Completes 11th Starship Test Flight, Gears Up For Upgraded Moon, Mars Missions - BW Businessworld**\nSpaceX successfully completed its 11th Starship test flight on October 14, 2025, launching the Starship system\u2014comprising the upper-stage Starship and Super Heavy booster\u2014from its Starbase site in Texas at 6:23 p.m. CT. The Super Heavy booster performed a controlled descent and soft water landing in the Gulf of Mexico seven minutes after liftoff, testing a new engine configuration before self-destructing as planned. The Starship upper stage completed orbital maneuvers, including a brief engine reignition, tested new heat-shield tiles during reentry, and splashed down in the Indian Ocean near Western Australia. This flight followed a successful August 2024 mission that ended a streak of earlier failures. Acting NASA Administrator Sean Duffy described the test as 'another major step toward landing Americans on the Moon's south pole.' Upcoming missions will feature an upgraded Starship prototype with docking adapters and orbital refuelling hardware, a critical capability for future Moon and Mars missions. SpaceX President Gwynne Shotwell stated the improved prototype could fly by late 2025 or early 2026. Elon Musk projected a 2026 demonstration of orbital refuelling between two Starships, a milestone NASA initially expected in 2025. Orbital refuelling is essential for lunar landings, with multiple tanker flights needed to fuel a single Starship for a Moon mission. The project is part of a $3 billion NASA Artemis programme contract awarded in 2021, aimed at returning humans to the Moon for the first time since 1972. NASA's safety panel has warned that delays in developing Starship\u2019s lunar lander components could jeopardize the 2027 lunar landing target. Starship, the most powerful rocket ever built\u2014larger than the Falcon 9\u2014also supports SpaceX\u2019s goal of deploying heavier Starlink satellites and Musk\u2019s long-term vision of sending humans and cargo to Mars.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 06:59 AM\nSource:[BW Businessworld](https://www.businessworld.in/article/spacex-completes-11th-starship-test-flight-gears-up-for-upgraded-moon-mars-missions-575429)\n\n**SpaceX Conducts Final Test Before Upgraded Starship's Lunar Mission Readiness**\nSpaceX successfully conducted its 11th flight test of the Starship spacecraft on October 13, 2025, launching from Starbase in Texas at 18:23 local time (02:24 MSK on October 14). The mission tested the Starship's heat shield and landing procedures, with the spacecraft splashing down in the Indian Ocean and the Super Heavy rocket booster making a controlled splashdown in the Gulf of Mexico. This test closely mirrored the August 2025 flight, including orbital deployment of Starlink satellite prototypes, in-space engine burns, and thermal protection system validation. NASA Administrator Sean Duffy called the mission 'another important step toward landing Americans at the lunar south pole' in a live broadcast on X (formerly Twitter). SpaceX plans to conduct future tests with a fully upgraded Starship prototype, designed for lunar and Mars missions, featuring docking modules and systems for orbital refueling. The upgraded version is expected to be ready for flight by late 2025 or early 2026, with orbital refueling of two Starships planned for 2026\u2014later than NASA\u2019s original 2024 target. A crewed lunar mission is scheduled for 2027, requiring multiple Starship tankers to refuel the lunar lander. This effort is part of a $3 billion NASA Artemis contract awarded to SpaceX in 2021, placing the company at the center of the U.S.-China lunar race, with China targeting a crewed lunar landing by 2030. Key next steps for SpaceX include developing a lunar lander and conducting a test landing on the Moon. Starship surpasses the Falcon 9 in power and is central to SpaceX\u2019s goals of expanding Starlink satellite deployment and enabling interplanetary travel.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: October 14, 2025 05:55 AM\nSource:[Forbes.ru](https://www.forbes.ru/tekhnologii/547774-spacex-ispytala-starship-pered-nacalom-zapuskov-obnovlennoj-dla-poleta-na-lunu-versii)\n\n**Starship's elementary era ends today with mega-rocket's 11th test flight**\nSpaceX is set to conduct the 11th full-scale test flight of the Starship rocket on Monday, October 13, 2025, at 6:15 pm CDT (23:15 UTC), marking the end of Starship's current 'Version 2' era. The mission, launching from Starbase, Texas, features a previously flown Super Heavy booster and aims to validate a new '13-5-3' engine burn sequence during descent for improved resilience to engine failure. The Starship upper stage will deploy eight Starlink satellite simulators and perform a dynamic banking maneuver and subsonic guidance test before a controlled splashdown in the Indian Ocean approximately 66 minutes after liftoff. A key focus is testing the heat shield on vulnerable areas where ceramic tiles have been intentionally removed to stress-test their performance under reentry conditions of up to 2,600\u00b0F (1,430\u00b0C). This flight is the final test of Starship Version 2, which has had a success rate of about 40%. The upcoming Starship Version 3, expected to debut in early 2026, will feature upgraded Raptor engines, larger propellant tanks, and in-orbit refueling capability. The second launch pad at Starbase, equipped with a flame trench, will support future high-frequency flights. NASA relies on this accelerated flight rate to meet its Artemis lunar program goals, with SpaceX holding over $4 billion in contracts to develop a human-rated lunar lander. The first in-orbit refueling test is expected in 2026 but depends on a smoother rollout of Version 3.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 13, 2025 07:27 PM\nSource:[Ars Technica](https://arstechnica.com/science/2025/10/starships-elementary-era-ends-today-with-mega-rockets-11th-test-flight/)\n\n**3 Questions: How a New Mission to Uranus Could Be Just Around the Corner**\nThe successful August 26, 2025, test flight of SpaceX's Starship, which achieved full orbital launch, deployed eight test satellites, and survived reentry with mostly intact recovery in the Indian Ocean, has reignited interest in deep-space exploration. Starship, the world's largest rocket at 400 feet tall with a 33-engine 'super heavy' booster, is capable of carrying up to 150 tons to low Earth orbit\u2014significantly exceeding current launch vehicles. This capability could accelerate flagship missions like the proposed Uranus Orbiter and Probe (UOP), prioritized by the 2022 National Academy of Sciences Planetary Science Decadal Survey for the 2030s. Previously, a Falcon Heavy launch was expected to result in a 13-year cruise to Uranus, but a recent MIT study co-authored by PhD student Chloe Gentgen shows that a refueled Starship could reduce this to as little as six years. Starship could enable direct trajectories to Uranus without gravity assists, and potentially use aerocapture\u2014using the planet's atmosphere to slow down\u2014thanks to its existing thermal protection system. The study also found that Starship could deliver larger payloads, allowing for enhanced scientific instruments or additional probes. However, Starship remains under development, and on-orbit refueling\u2014a key requirement\u2014has yet to be demonstrated. Mission selection for Uranus is expected two years after the official formulation process begins, which has not yet started, leaving the timeline uncertain despite promising early results.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 11, 2025 12:30 AM\nSource:[The Good Men Project](https://goodmenproject.com/featured-content/3-questions-how-a-new-mission-to-uranus-could-be-just-around-the-corner/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
