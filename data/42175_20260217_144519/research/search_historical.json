Eric Berger cited NASA's Amit Kshatriya, who indicated SpaceX would perform a Starship-to-Starship cryogenic propellant transfer test in 2025.\n\n## Note on Timeline Discrepancy:\nThere appears to be conflicting information about the timeline, with earlier statements suggesting 2025 and later statements (particularly Musk's February 2025 comment) indicating a delay to 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://driveteslacanada.ca/news/spacex-proposes-simplified-starship-moon-landing-plan-as-nasa-pushes-for-faster-progress/\">\n# Summary of Article: SpaceX Proposes Simplified Starship Moon Landing Plan\n\n**Source:** Drive Tesla, October 31, 2025, by Matt Wilson\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**SpaceX's Revised Approach:**\n- SpaceX has proposed a \"simplified mission architecture and concept of operations\" for its Starship lunar lander program\n- The company claims this approach will accelerate the return to the Moon while improving crew safety\n- Specific details of the simplified plan were not disclosed\n\n**Contract and Progress:**\n- SpaceX has a $4 billion Human Landing System (HLS) contract with NASA\n- The company claims to have achieved \"dozens of milestones\" under this contract\n- SpaceX was selected in 2021 to provide the lander for Artemis III and IV missions\n- Blue Origin secured a separate contract for later missions\n\n**Timeline and Testing:**\n- SpaceX is preparing for a long-duration flight test in 2026\n- The company is developing a Starship crew cabin for lunar missions\n- **SpaceX now expects to conduct in-space refueling test in 2026**\n- Additional flight tests will use an upgraded V3 Starship prototype\n\n**In-Space Refueling:**\n- Starship's lunar missions require in-space refueling capability\n- This involves multiple Starship \"tanker\" flights filling the lunar-bound spacecraft with fuel in orbit\n- This is described as \"a complex operation that has never been demonstrated before\"\n\n**NASA Concerns:**\n- NASA acting administrator Sean Duffy (also U.S. Secretary of Transportation) suggested SpaceX was falling behind schedule\n- Duffy hinted NASA could reopen the contract to allow competitors like Blue Origin to propose faster alternatives\n- NASA expressed frustration about development delays, noting the agency \"cannot afford to fall behind\" as China advances its lunar plans\n- Elon Musk responded with criticism of Duffy on social media\n\n**SpaceX's Position:**\n- The company maintains that \"Starship continues to simultaneously be the fastest path to returning humans to the surface of the Moon\"\n- SpaceX describes Starship as \"a core enabler of the Artemis program's goal to establish a permanent, sustainable presence on the lunar surface\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2025/11/04/spacex-starship-lunar-lander-nasa/87010897007/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"SpaceX to work on 'simplified' Starship after NASA reopens lunar lander contract\"\n\n**Source:** USA TODAY\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **NASA Contract Value:** NASA awarded SpaceX a contract now worth $4.4 billion to develop a lunar lander capable of transporting humans to the lunar surface.\n\n2. **Artemis Timeline:** \n   - Artemis 2: Planned for 2026 (10-day mission circling the moon with four astronauts)\n   - Artemis 3 (moon landing): No earlier than 2027\n\n3. **Starship Specifications:** Approximately 400-foot megarocket, regarded as the world's largest rocket when fully stacked.\n\n4. **Cargo Capacity:** Starship could carry up to 100 tons of cargo directly to the lunar surface.\n\n## Key Developments:\n\n**SpaceX's New Plan:**\n- SpaceX announced (Oct. 30, in a blog post) a \"simplified mission architecture and concept of operations\" for Starship\n- The plan hinges on a **key 2026 milestone**: demonstrating that Starship can refuel in orbit\n- This refueling demonstration would occur during a long-duration flight test using Starship Version 3 (V3)\n- The refueling process requires two vehicles with docking adapters to meet in orbit and transfer hundreds of tons of super-cooled propellant\n\n**NASA's Response:**\n- NASA recently reopened the lunar lander contract to consider other options from rivals like Blue Origin and Lockheed Martin\n- Sean Duffy (Trump-appointed acting NASA head) cited SpaceX's development lags as a reason for considering alternatives\n- NASA wants to beat China back to the moon before the decade ends\n\n**SpaceX's Counter-argument:**\n- SpaceX stated it is \"moving at a historically rapid pace\"\n- The company claimed it \"has received money only on contractual milestones that have been successfully completed, the vast majority of which have been achieved on time or ahead of schedule\"\n- SpaceX asserted: \"Starship will bring the United States back to the moon before any other nation\"\n\n## Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\nThis article directly addresses the 2026 orbital refueling demonstration that is the subject of the underlying Metaculus question.

Also list external events those comments reference.\n1. Current community prediction (Metaculus Q #41142)  \n   \u2022 The only machine\u2013readable value surfaced in the material is contained in the Metaculus API stub   \n     {\"post_id\":41142,\u2026\"last_cp\":0.4}. 0.4 corresponds to 40 %.  \n   \u2022 This matches the narrative statement in the context: \u201cThe current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 40.00 %.\u201d  \n   \u2192 Current probability: 40 % as of 16 Feb 2026.\n\n2. Change-history of the community prediction (Jan 2025 \u2192 Feb 2026)  \n   No time-series points or chart data were returned in the search results; therefore a month-by-month or inflection-point history cannot be reconstructed from the information provided.  This is a material information gap.\n\n3. February 2026 Metaculus comment activity dealing with schedule or technical risk  \n   \u2022 No Metaculus comment pages were retrieved; consequently, direct quotations, \u201cagree\u201d counts, or timestamps cannot be presented.  \n   \u2022 Nevertheless, external events in early February 2026 that forecasters would almost certainly have cited when discussing schedule or technical risk are documented in the news coverage gathered:\n\n     a) Artemis II wet-dress-rehearsal failure and launch slip  \n        \u2013 Hydrogen leak in SLS core stage triggered NASA to move the earliest launch date from February to 6 March 2026 (Houston Public Media, 3 Feb 2026; NPR, 3 Feb 2026).  \n        \u2013 Engineers also reported Orion-hatch valve issues, camera malfunctions in cold weather, and comms dropouts.  \n        \u2013 NASA officials publicly stressed that further delays were possible if the retest failed.  \n        \u2013 Relevance: Artemis III (targeted NET 2027) depends on a chain that includes a successful Artemis II and the Starship in-orbit refuelling demo; slippage increases schedule pressure on SpaceX.\n\n     b) Cold-weather-driven postponement of Artemis-related SLS tanking test (Spaceflight Now, 30 Jan 2026).  \n        \u2013 The same arctic outbreak caused NASA to defer the SLS tanking test and compress February launch opportunities.  \n        \u2013 Relevance: Reinforces schedule uncertainty and illustrates how exogenous weather can derail critical-path tests.\n\n   \u2022 Given that Metaculus forecasters routinely fold Artemis milestones into their Starship refuelling probabilities, these NASA slips are the most likely external events referenced in February 2026 comment threads about \u201cschedule risk\u201d and \u201ctechnical risk\u201d.\n\n4. External events likely referenced in February 2026 comments (consolidated list)  \n   \u2022 3 Feb 2026: NASA delays Artemis II to March because of hydrogen leak and other anomalies (Houston Public Media; NPR).  \n   \u2022 30 Jan 2026: SLS wet-dress rehearsal and earliest Artemis II launch opportunity slip due to cold weather (Spaceflight Now).  \n   \u2022 Any subsequent success/failure of the re-run wet-dress rehearsal (not yet reported by the cut-off date 16 Feb 2026) would be watched closely, but no definitive outcome is in the supplied sources.\n\n5. Information gaps remaining  \n   \u2022 Continuous probability history from 1 Jan 2025 onward (specific dates/values).  \n   \u2022 Text and metadata of Metaculus comments posted in Feb 2026 that explicitly cite schedule or technical risk and the number of \u201clikes/agreements\u201d that make them \u201ctop\u201d comments.\n\nWithout the Metaculus API calls for /questions/41142/comments or /questions/41142/prediction-history, those two items cannot be completed.</Agent_report>\n"
