Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. CNBC (17 Feb 2026) – Figma/Anthropic partnership on AI-generated code→design.  Fact: no BCI mention.  Reliable business press; neutral.  
2. openPR (17 Feb 2026) – Brain-implant market forecast.  Promotional market report; weak reliability; no coding-tool link.  
3. Sina & other Chinese tech blogs (15-17 Feb 2026) – Musk video and Chinese AI-coding model launches.  Opinion-heavy, no BCI; modest relevance (may spur optimism about non-keyboard coding, but speculative).  
4. VMblog (5 Jan 2026) – Expert predictions on agentic AI.  Credible named experts; BCI not discussed.  
5. Healthcare IT Today (9 Jan 2026) – Neurable $35 M funding.  Verifiable; shows non-invasive BCI progress; still early-stage, no IDE integration.  
6. MassDevice & SynBioBeta (Nov 2025) – Paradromics FDA IDE approval.  Medical focus, no coding-tool tie-in.  
Overall, no source reports a first-party BCI integration in any mainstream IDE, nor any rumour of one being imminent in the next eleven days; quality ranges from high (CNBC) to low (openPR).

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong: none.  
Moderate (small positive shift):  
• Continued VC/funding momentum (Neurable, Paradromics) keeps “BCI mainstreaming” narrative alive.  
Weak (negative or inertial):  
• Absence of concrete announcements; historical Metaculus behaviour—CP drifts slowly and often downward in short windows when no news.  
• Threshold-stickiness: CP sitting exactly at 25 % suggests rounding inertia; a few forecasts are needed to lift it above.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon to resolution: 11 days.  Platform median is recency-weighted but usually updates only when ~5-15 fresh forecasts arrive.  Halving the horizon (≈5 days) would trim volatility further, pushing probability ~2 pp lower; doubling (≈22 days) would raise chance of any move by ~3-4 pp.

(d) Justification  
Outside-view base rate (short-horizon CP movement around cut-point) ≈46 %.  
Adjustments:  
–1 pp for mild time-decay bias on “by Nov 2026” questions.  
–2 pp for round-number stickiness at 25.00 %.  
+0.5 pp for steady drumbeat of BCI investment news that could prompt a few optimistic edits.  
Net inside-view: 43.5 %.

Probability calibration
Interpreting 43.5 %: out of 100 similar 11-day windows where the CP started at the threshold, it would finish >25 % about 44 times.  The 90 % credible range feels ±15 pp (i.e., 29–59 %), reflecting scant volatility data.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase (<30 w): “On 28 Feb 2026 will Metaculus median be strictly above 25 % for ‘BCI–coding-tool integration before Nov 2026’?”  
2. Outside-view base rate: 46 %.  
3. Consistency: “44 out of 100 times, the CP ends above 25 %.” ✔  
4. Key evidence (≤20 w each):  
   – Metaculus medians shift slowly over 1-2 weeks.  
   – No new BCI–IDE announcement in sources.  
   – Funding news sustains but doesn’t spike optimism.  
   – Exact 25 % threshold increases inertia.  
5. Blind-spot: Viral rumour/leak of VS Code–Neuralink beta within next week could spike CP >30 %.  
6. Status-quo outcome: CP stays at 25 % or drifts lower; bias slightly toward “No”.

Probability: 44%
