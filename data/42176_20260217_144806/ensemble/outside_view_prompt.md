You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 25.00% on 2026-02-28 for the Metaculus question "Will any coding tool introduce an integration with brain-computer interface technology before November 2026?"?

Question background:
Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. 

--------------------------------

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40281
- Original question title: Will any coding tool introduce an integration with brain-computer interface technology before November 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 25.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> The question will resolve as **Yes** if, before November 1, 2026, a publicly accessible coding tool releases an integration with brain-computer interface technology.

Original fine print: 
> Third-party plugins or apps will not resolve this question as **Yes**. The integration has to be a first-party feature.

Original background: 
> [<u>Brain-computer interfaces</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface) (BCIs) are systems that enable direct communication between a human brain and an external device, typically by interpreting neural activity to control software or hardware. While BCIs have been largely explored for medical, gaming, and communication purposes, recent advances in neural decoding, wearable EEG devices, and implantable systems such as [<u>Neuralink</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink) have increased interest in integrating brain signals with general computing tools. Both [<u>companies</u>](https://www.wired.com/story/neuralink-implant-first-human-patient-demonstration/) and [<u>research groups</u>](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9313199/) have demonstrated limited control of text editors or code environments through neural input.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40281) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-28 13:07:32 is higher than 25.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 25.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-28 13:07:32, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

Question metadata:
- Opened for forecasting: 2026-02-17T14:35:32Z
- Resolves: 2026-02-28T13:07:32Z
- Note: Unless the question title specifies otherwise, the Forecast Opening Date of 2026-02-17T14:35:32Z should be considered the start of the question's resolution window. Events before this date do not count toward resolution.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-17. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-17 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve Metaculus question 40281 time-series predictions for last 60 days and summarize latest comments discussing possible near-term BCI tool releases; also identify any scheduled events before Feb 28 2026 that commenters cite as catalysts.
1. Community-prediction time-series (last 60 days)

None of the material returned in the current search dump contains the numerical daily or weekly community-prediction values for Metaculus question 40281. We therefore still lack the datapoints needed to chart how the probability has moved during the last two months and to compute the exact trend or volatility. The only figure visible in the prompt is the single “current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 25.00 %.” Absent the raw history, no quantitative summary (e.g., high, low, mean, or slope) can be produced. This remains a critical information gap.

2. Substantive discussion in recent Metaculus comments

Likewise, the returned documents do not quote or paraphrase any of the comment thread on Metaculus question 40281. Consequently, we have no direct evidence of what forecasters have been debating in January–February 2026 about short-term BCI integrations into coding tools. That means we cannot yet extract the community’s argumentation, reference links, or cited probabilities. This is another gap that must be filled with a direct scrape or manual reading of the Metaculus page.

3. External developments that commenters are likely citing as near-term catalysts

Although we do not have the commenters’ words, several concrete milestones in the broader BCI landscape—visible in the returned news and technical sources—stand out as plausible catalysts that Metaculus participants are almost certainly tracking. All of them occur before the 28 February 2026 checkpoint for the derivative forecast you are preparing:

a) Neuralink human-trial expansion through 2025–26  
   • Elon Musk said Neuralink expects “20 or 30” additional human implants during 2025 (MIT Technology Review, 16 Jan 2025).  
   • A “pivotal trial” with 20-40 patients must precede any FDA marketing submission and has not started yet (MIT Technology Review, 16 Jan 2025).  
   • Neuralink displayed its second-generation “Telepathy” input device and “Blindsight” visual prosthesis roadmap in the June 2025 update (Singju Post, 28 Jun 2025).  
   Why it matters for the coding-tool question: If Neuralink publicly releases an SDK that lets users type or control an IDE hands-free, that could qualify as a first-party BCI integration with a coding environment.

b) Secure wireless BCI for smart-device control demonstrated in peer-reviewed paper (Nature Communications, 25 Aug 2025).  
   Although academic, the work shows a fusion-coding metasurface enabling EEG-driven commands to external devices. Any commercialization or spin-off into developer tools by 2026 would be viewed as de-risking.

c) Low-cost ESP32-based EEG board “Cerelog ESP-EEG” entering the hobbyist market (CNX Software, 26 Dec 2025).  
   Open-source hardware combined with BrainFlow APIs lowers the barrier for independent software vendors to experiment with BCI control of editors.

d) OpenBCI GUI 5.0+ adopting BrainFlow as the core driver layer (OpenBCI docs, 16 Jul 2025).  
   OpenBCI remains the de-facto standard for DIY BCI hacking. A direct plugin for VS Code or JetBrains based on the BrainFlow API would meet the Metaculus resolution criteria if shipped by OpenBCI itself rather than a third party.

e) Provincial funding program “Empower BCI” in Ontario rolling out headsets and custom software to 20 pediatric rehab centres over 2025-29 (Ontario Hospital Assoc., 2025).  
   While healthcare-oriented, the program could finance new communication software modules that later get generalized to coding environments.

4. Likely causal pathways discussed by forecasters (inferred from news)

Given the above milestones, the intuition behind a >25 % community prediction probably hinges on two paths:

Path 1: Neuralink (or another implanted-device firm such as Precision Neuroscience) ships a developer-focused “cursor/keyboard” feature bundled inside its official app before November 2026. Once even a limited “type into VS Code by thought” demo is delivered to early human subjects and rolled out as an officially supported feature, the Metaculus question would resolve Yes.

Path 2: Non-invasive vendors (OpenBCI, NextMind successor, Cognixion) add a native extension to a mainstream IDE they control. For instance, OpenBCI could integrate its GUI’s Python-based widgets directly into an Electron-based IDE and market it as an accessibility feature. Because OpenBCI is first-party to its own hardware/software stack, such an integration would arguably satisfy the “first-party” clause even if the IDE itself is open-source.

5. Remaining information gaps

• 60-day prediction time series for question 40281.  
• Direct quotations or summaries of the most recent Metaculus comments (to verify which of the above milestones are explicitly referenced).  
These two items are indispensable for a rigorous forecast calibration.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
