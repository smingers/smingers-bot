    "description": "Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40281\n- Original question title: Will any coding tool introduce an integration with brain-computer interface technology before November 2026?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 25.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> The question will resolve as **Yes** if, before November 1, 2026, a publicly accessible coding tool releases an integration with brain-computer interface technology.\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> Third-party plugins or apps will not resolve this question as **Yes**. The integration has to be a first-party feature.\n\nOriginal background: \n> [<u>Brain-computer interfaces</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface) (BCIs) are systems that enable direct communication between a human brain and an external device, typically by interpreting neural activity to control software or hardware. While BCIs have been largely explored for medical, gaming, and communication purposes, recent advances in neural decoding, wearable EEG devices, and implantable systems such as [<u>Neuralink</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink) have increased interest in integrating brain signals with general computing tools. Both [<u>companies</u>](https://www.wired.com/story/neuralink-implant-first-human-patient-demonstration/) and [<u>research groups</u>](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9313199/) have demonstrated limited control of text editors or code environments through neural input.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40281,\"question_id\":39825,\"last_cp\":0.25}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40281) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-28 13:07:32 is higher than 25.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 25.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-28 13:07:32, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.",
