Analysis:
To estimate whether the Metaculus community prediction will climb above 25 % by 2026-02-28, I need very recent signals that could make forecasters more optimistic about a near-term first-party BCI integration in a coding tool. The most influential pieces of news would be:
• Official announcements or credible leaks from major IDE or code-assistant vendors (e.g., Microsoft VS Code, GitHub, JetBrains, Replit, AWS, Google) that they are working with Neuralink, Synchron, Neurable, etc.  
• Venture-funding or partnership press releases linking BCI companies with developer-tool companies.  
• Demonstrations or road-maps presented at tech conferences since late 2025 that explicitly mention a forthcoming BCI mode for writing code.  
• Regulatory approvals or human-trial milestones (e.g., Neuralink’s first patient successfully controlling a cursor) that could spur optimism about consumer-grade BCI peripherals becoming available by 2026.

Therefore I should look for: “coding tool” + “brain-computer interface,” “BCI IDE,” “Neuralink developer kit,” “VS Code brain control,” and similar phrases, limiting to 2025-2026. I’ll use:
• Google – broad web coverage for blog posts or company pages.  
• Google News – journalistic sources and press releases from the last few days/weeks.  
• AskNews – a natural-language query to scour specialized tech media for the 2025-2026 window.
