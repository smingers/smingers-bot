You are currently doing research for current information/news articles on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 25.00% on 2026-02-28 for the Metaculus question "Will any coding tool introduce an integration with brain-computer interface technology before November 2026?"?

Question background:
Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. 

--------------------------------

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40281
- Original question title: Will any coding tool introduce an integration with brain-computer interface technology before November 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 25.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> The question will resolve as **Yes** if, before November 1, 2026, a publicly accessible coding tool releases an integration with brain-computer interface technology.

Original fine print: 
> Third-party plugins or apps will not resolve this question as **Yes**. The integration has to be a first-party feature.

Original background: 
> [<u>Brain-computer interfaces</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brain%E2%80%93computer_interface) (BCIs) are systems that enable direct communication between a human brain and an external device, typically by interpreting neural activity to control software or hardware. While BCIs have been largely explored for medical, gaming, and communication purposes, recent advances in neural decoding, wearable EEG devices, and implantable systems such as [<u>Neuralink</u>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuralink) have increased interest in integrating brain signals with general computing tools. Both [<u>companies</u>](https://www.wired.com/story/neuralink-implant-first-human-patient-demonstration/) and [<u>research groups</u>](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC9313199/) have demonstrated limited control of text editors or code environments through neural input.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40281) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-28 13:07:32 is higher than 25.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 25.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-28 13:07:32, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-17. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-17 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find current news relevant to the question. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or AskNews.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For AskNews:
AskNews supports natural language. Write a query of up to two sentences, specifying relevant scope (e.g., geography, industry, time period). Avoid ambiguous acronyms.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one AskNews query.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant current information/news articles needed to generate an inside view.}

Search queries:
1. your query here (Google)
2. your query here (Google News)
3. your query here (AskNews)
