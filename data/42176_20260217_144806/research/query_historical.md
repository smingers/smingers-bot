Analysis:
The key to judging whether the community prediction will climb above 25 % in the next eleven days is understanding two things:

1. How volatile Metaculus community predictions typically are over short windows (one- to two-week horizons) for comparable “tech adoption” questions.  
2. Whether there is any imminent news about brain-computer interface (BCI) integrations with developer tools that could plausibly move sentiment (e.g., Neuralink demos, Microsoft/VS Code or GitHub Copilot announcements, Apple BCI patents, OpenAI DevDay-style events, major conferences such as GDC in March, etc.).

Therefore, useful historical context includes:
• The recent prediction history and comment thread of the specific Metaculus question (#40281).  
• Past one-month price charts for similar Metaculus questions to gauge typical day-to-day swings.  
• Any press releases or coverage since late January 2026 hinting at BCI integrations in IDEs or code assistants.  
• Upcoming conference schedules and rumored announcements that forecasters might be anticipating.
