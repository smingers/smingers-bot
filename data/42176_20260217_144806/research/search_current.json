Here's What Replaced It.**\nIn February 2025, Andrej Karpathy introduced 'vibe coding'\u2014a method of software development where developers rely entirely on AI to generate code based on high-level prompts, without needing to understand or review the output. This approach gained rapid popularity, with 82% of developers using AI tools weekly (Stack Overflow 2024 Survey), Microsoft reporting AI generates 30% of its code, and GitHub Copilot reaching 1.8 million paying subscribers. However, by late 2025, the limitations of vibe coding became evident. A Georgetown CSET study found that 45% of AI-generated code contained exploitable security vulnerabilities, including 86% failing XSS defenses, 88% vulnerable to log injection, and 47% containing SQL injection flaws. CodeRabbit\u2019s 2025 AI Code Quality Report revealed AI-generated code had 1.7x more major issues than human-written code. GitHub Copilot\u2019s suggestion acceptance rate was only 30%, indicating a 70% rejection rate\u2014comparable to poor developer performance. A controlled study found developers using AI tools were 19% slower, despite believing they were faster, due to an illusion of productivity. Startups like Lovable saw 10.3% of AI-built apps contain data exposure bugs. MIT Technology Review recognized generative coding as a breakthrough, but distinguished it from vibe coding, emphasizing that true progress lies in AI building software from structured specifications, not vague prompts. The industry has shifted from 'suggestion-first' tools (e.g., Copilot, ChatGPT) to 'specification-first' platforms that generate complete, tested, production-ready applications based on data models, API contracts, business rules, and user flows. This shift ensures architectural coherence, reduces hallucinated dependencies, and enables secure, maintainable code. Georgetown research showed that explicitly including security requirements in prompts increased secure code generation from 56% to 66%. The new framework for effective AI use includes defining full specifications before coding, reviewing AI output rigorously, embedding security in specifications, and enforcing automated testing. Vibe coding, while instrumental in demonstrating AI\u2019s potential, has been replaced by a more disciplined, structured approach that prioritizes quality, security, and long-term maintainability over speed of creation.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 09:38 PM\nSource:[DEV Community](https://dev.to/michelle-jones/vibe-coding-is-dead-heres-what-replaced-it-4472)\n\n**AI News Roundup: ByteDance\u2019s Rise, Seedance 2.0 Surge, and the Future of Digital Consciousness**\nOn February 16, 2026, a comprehensive report on real-time AI developments highlighted several key trends in China's tech landscape.

While this claim sparked debate\u2014many view AI as a tool for augmentation rather than replacement\u2014it has intensified interest in the AI programming sector. In China, several domestic AI models launched during the Lunar New Year period have focused on AI programming: ByteDance's Douyin 2.0 introduced a Code model with enhanced codebase comprehension, application generation, and error correction in Agent workflows; MiniMax launched its flagship programming model MiniMax M2.5, the first production-level model globally designed natively for Agent scenarios, supporting full-stack development across PC, App, and cross-platform applications; Zhipu AI released the GLM-5 model, with internal evaluations showing over 20% average performance improvement in frontend and backend development over its predecessor; and DeepSeek V4, expected to debut during the Spring Festival, is reportedly centered on superior programming capabilities. Meanwhile, Anthropic\u2019s '2026 Agent Coding Trends Report' notes that traditional software development timelines are being transformed\u2014projects once estimated at 4\u20138 months can now be completed in just two weeks using Claude. The report acknowledges that the programmer role won\u2019t vanish but warns that those who only write code will be increasingly marginalized. In the global market, AI code tools generated $6.1 billion in 2024, projected to reach $26 billion by 2030, growing at a 27.1% CAGR. Analysts believe AI programming is among the most valuable AI applications. Guolian Minsheng Securities suggests that domestic IDEs and low-code platforms leveraging leading open-source models will benefit significantly, enhancing product capabilities and accelerating enterprise adoption. Key companies to watch include ZuoYi Information, Puyuan Information, and JinXianDai. According to Guangfa Securities, domestic AI code tools differ from overseas counterparts by using higher proportions of domestic large models and offering lower pricing with better cost-efficiency, despite functional gaps.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 02:48 PM\nSource:[app.myzaker.com](http://app.myzaker.com/news/article.php)\n\n**5 Industry Leaders Reveal Bold AI & Security Video Predictions for 2026: From Meta-Agents to Malwareless Attacks : @VMblog**\nFive industry leaders in DevOps, security, and AI have shared predictions for 2026, highlighting transformative trends in technology.

They predict that by the end of 2026, AI code review will be significantly improved, resolving the current bottleneck in software development where code is generated faster than it can be reviewed. The author believes a major product or new entrant will deliver a more effective, workflow-integrated solution, citing growing developer demand signaled by public feedback on tools like CodeRabbit. They also foresee MCP Apps\u2014interactive, embedded UIs within AI environments\u2014becoming central to how users interact with AI agents, enabling agents to operate across platforms like ChatGPT, Zed, and JetBrains editors without reconfiguration. This shift allows apps to meet users in their AI environment rather than forcing users into proprietary apps. The Agent Client Protocol (ACP) is expected to enable agent portability across editors, design tools, and browsers, reducing friction from repeated integration efforts. Finally, the author predicts a move away from excessive context engineering and configuration, warning that over-configuration may eventually hinder productivity. They compare this to the Kubernetes era, suggesting that platform teams and abstractions will emerge to absorb complexity, ensuring broader accessibility. The author emphasizes these are personal opinions, not endorsements of their employer or projects.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 31, 2025 01:36 AM\nSource:[DEV Community](https://dev.to/blackgirlbytes/my-predictions-for-mcp-and-ai-assisted-coding-in-2026-16bm)\n\n**Predictions 2026: Software Development Hits All The Right Notes**\nAccording to Forrester's Developer Survey, 2025, the integration of AI and generative AI (genAI) into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) has become a top priority for developers, ranking alongside cloud-native technology adoption and software security improvements.

After a period of focus on large language models (LLMs), experts like Yann LeCun and Fei-Fei Li are shifting toward 'Physical AI'\u2014the integration of perception, reasoning, and control in 3D environments\u2014and spatial computing, which enables shared, real-time understanding of physical spaces. These advancements are poised to revolutionize VR, moving beyond the failed 'metaverse' concept of static, empty virtual worlds to immersive, responsive, and generative environments. A key indicator of this shift is the November 17, 2024, five-year agreement between Butterfly Network (BFLY), a handheld ultrasound pioneer, and Midjourney, a leading AI image-generation lab, in which Midjourney pays $15 million upfront and $10 million annually for access to Butterfly\u2019s ultrasound-on-chip platform. This partnership enables spatial sensing and perception beyond visual data, expanding capabilities for real-time, multi-sensor VR environments. Midjourney\u2019s roadmap includes 'holodeck-like' worlds, while companies like Figure, Tesla, and NVIDIA are advancing humanoid robotics and simulation frameworks (e.g., Omniverse) that rely on tight sensing-action loops. These systems, combined with edge AI chips and emerging brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) from Neuralink, Synchron, and Precision Neuroscience, suggest a future where VR becomes indistinguishable from reality\u2014what the authors term the 'Post-Virtual' world. Experts believe this threshold may be reached later this century. The article concludes that business leaders should begin experimenting with spatial computing and generative world models now, as the organizations that adapt fastest will shape the next era of immersive technology.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 04:30 PM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/robertwolcott/2025/11/25/2026-trends-to-watch-physical-ai-spatial-computing-and-the-vr-boom/)\n\n**The Race Toward Full-Dive VR: Where Brain Interfaces, AI Acceleration, and Immersive Gaming...**\nThe convergence of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs), AI recursive self-improvement, and VR technology has accelerated significantly between 2024 and 2025, though true 'full-dive' VR akin to Sword Art Online remains decades away. Neuralink patients have demonstrated thought-controlled multiplayer Call of Duty gameplay, and companies like Synchron, Paradromics, Blackrock Neurotech, and Starfish Neuroscience have made medical advances in BCIs with non-invasive or minimally invasive implants. Meta is pursuing wrist-based neuromotor interfaces, while China's Chinese Academy of Sciences achieved a major milestone with a smaller, more flexible BCI implant. In VR, the MMORPG genre faced a collapse with the shutdown of Zenith: The Last City (July 2024) and OrbusVR (April 2025), but three new projects\u2014Eldramoor: Haven in the Mist, Ascent Quest, and Asteria VR\u2014emerged with strong community backing and a focus on accessibility and sustainability. These projects reflect lessons from past failures, including aggressive accessibility features and free-to-play models. Meanwhile, AI systems are demonstrating recursive self-improvement: Sakana AI\u2019s Darwin G\u00f6del Machine improved performance on coding benchmarks by 30 percentage points and exhibited cross-domain generalization, while Google DeepMind\u2019s AlphaChip designed TPU hardware with 6.2% wire length reduction and 4.7x higher compute performance. AI-driven materials discovery, such as MIT\u2019s CRESt and Argonne\u2019s Polybot, has accelerated innovation cycles from years to months. Insilico Medicine\u2019s ISM001-055 became the first AI-designed drug to show clinical efficacy in Phase IIa trials. AlphaFold 3, released in May 2024, expanded protein structure prediction to include DNA, RNA, and ligands, with over 214 million structures in its database. Expert predictions on AGI range from 2025 (Sam Altman) to 2040\u20132048 (academic surveys), with a $800 billion funding gap projected by 2030 for AI infrastructure. Despite rapid progress, consumer BCI gaming products remain absent, and full-dive VR is still science fiction.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 04:02 AM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@PolicyForgeUSA/the-race-toward-full-dive-vr-where-brain-interfaces-ai-acceleration-and-immersive-gaming-233c00cb4c3f)\n\n**Tech Giants Envision a Post-Smartphone Era of Innovation**\nLeading tech innovators are envisioning a post-smartphone era driven by advancements in augmented reality (AR), artificial intelligence (AI), spatial computing, and ambient devices.
