Community-prediction time-series (last 60 days)\n\nNone of the material returned in the current search dump contains the numerical daily or weekly community-prediction values for Metaculus question 40281. We therefore still lack the datapoints needed to chart how the probability has moved during the last two months and to compute the exact trend or volatility. The only figure visible in the prompt is the single \u201ccurrent community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 25.00 %.\u201d Absent the raw history, no quantitative summary (e.g., high, low, mean, or slope) can be produced. This remains a critical information gap.\n\n2. Substantive discussion in recent Metaculus comments\n\nLikewise, the returned documents do not quote or paraphrase any of the comment thread on Metaculus question 40281. Consequently, we have no direct evidence of what forecasters have been debating in January\u2013February 2026 about short-term BCI integrations into coding tools. That means we cannot yet extract the community\u2019s argumentation, reference links, or cited probabilities. This is another gap that must be filled with a direct scrape or manual reading of the Metaculus page.\n\n3. External developments that commenters are likely citing as near-term catalysts\n\nAlthough we do not have the commenters\u2019 words, several concrete milestones in the broader BCI landscape\u2014visible in the returned news and technical sources\u2014stand out as plausible catalysts that Metaculus participants are almost certainly tracking. All of them occur before the 28 February 2026 checkpoint for the derivative forecast you are preparing:\n\na) Neuralink human-trial expansion through 2025\u201326  \n   \u2022 Elon Musk said Neuralink expects \u201c20 or 30\u201d additional human implants during 2025 (MIT Technology Review, 16 Jan 2025).  \n   \u2022 A \u201cpivotal trial\u201d with 20-40 patients must precede any FDA marketing submission and has not started yet (MIT Technology Review, 16 Jan 2025).  \n   \u2022 Neuralink displayed its second-generation \u201cTelepathy\u201d input device and \u201cBlindsight\u201d visual prosthesis roadmap in the June 2025 update (Singju Post, 28 Jun 2025).  \n   Why it matters for the coding-tool question: If Neuralink publicly releases an SDK that lets users type or control an IDE hands-free, that could qualify as a first-party BCI integration with a coding environment.\n\nb) Secure wireless BCI for smart-device control demonstrated in peer-reviewed paper (Nature Communications, 25 Aug 2025).  \n   Although academic, the work shows a fusion-coding metasurface enabling EEG-driven commands to external devices. Any commercialization or spin-off into developer tools by 2026 would be viewed as de-risking.\n\nc) Low-cost ESP32-based EEG board \u201cCerelog ESP-EEG\u201d entering the hobbyist market (CNX Software, 26 Dec 2025).  \n   Open-source hardware combined with BrainFlow APIs lowers the barrier for independent software vendors to experiment with BCI control of editors.\n\nd) OpenBCI GUI 5.0+ adopting BrainFlow as the core driver layer (OpenBCI docs, 16 Jul 2025).  \n   OpenBCI remains the de-facto standard for DIY BCI hacking. A direct plugin for VS Code or JetBrains based on the BrainFlow API would meet the Metaculus resolution criteria if shipped by OpenBCI itself rather than a third party.\n\ne) Provincial funding program \u201cEmpower BCI\u201d in Ontario rolling out headsets and custom software to 20 pediatric rehab centres over 2025-29 (Ontario Hospital Assoc., 2025).  \n   While healthcare-oriented, the program could finance new communication software modules that later get generalized to coding environments.\n\n4. Likely causal pathways discussed by forecasters (inferred from news)\n\nGiven the above milestones, the intuition behind a >25 % community prediction probably hinges on two paths:\n\nPath 1: Neuralink (or another implanted-device firm such as Precision Neuroscience) ships a developer-focused \u201ccursor/keyboard\u201d feature bundled inside its official app before November 2026. Once even a limited \u201ctype into VS Code by thought\u201d demo is delivered to early human subjects and rolled out as an officially supported feature, the Metaculus question would resolve Yes.\n\nPath 2: Non-invasive vendors (OpenBCI, NextMind successor, Cognixion) add a native extension to a mainstream IDE they control. For instance, OpenBCI could integrate its GUI\u2019s Python-based widgets directly into an Electron-based IDE and market it as an accessibility feature. Because OpenBCI is first-party to its own hardware/software stack, such an integration would arguably satisfy the \u201cfirst-party\u201d clause even if the IDE itself is open-source.\n\n5. Remaining information gaps\n\n\u2022 60-day prediction time series for question 40281.  \n\u2022 Direct quotations or summaries of the most recent Metaculus comments (to verify which of the above milestones are explicitly referenced).  \nThese two items are indispensable for a rigorous forecast calibration.</Agent_report>\n"
