- U.S.-Azerbaijan Strategic Partnership Charter signed Feb 10
- Armenia visa exemption policy in effect (Jan 1 - Jul 1, 2026)
- India CDS visit to Armenia (Feb 2026)
- Ongoing Armenia-Russia tensions over EEU/EU alignment
- Parliamentary elections scheduled June 7, 2026

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**

1. **Post-spike decay pattern** - Multiple independent sources confirm VP Vance visit occurred Feb 9-12 with peak media coverage Feb 10 (Google Trends = 100). Historical analysis shows diplomatic events consistently decay within 7-14 days. Current value (90 on Feb 17) represents day 7 of decay. This establishes clear causal mechanism for continued decline.

2. **No scheduled major events Feb 17-28** - Agent report systematically reviewed event calendar. No genocide commemorations (April 24), no scheduled summits, no conflict anniversaries. Parliamentary election preparations are procedural and historically low-impact on search trends.

3. **Mean reversion pressure** - Current value (90) is 2.1 standard deviations above 90-day mean (70.1). Statistical tendency toward mean is well-established, especially absent new catalysts.

**Moderate Evidence:**

1. **Visa policy announcement** - Time Out and Travel & Tour World report Armenia's visa exemption (effective until July 1). This is positive tourism news but: (a) policy already in effect since Jan 1, so not "breaking news", (b) tourism stories historically don't drive sustained search interest, (c) affects specific demographics (tourists) rather than general news consumers.

2. **Armenia-Russia tensions** - Multiple sources (Nouvelles d'Arménie, bne IntelliNews) report ongoing diplomatic friction. However, these are incremental developments in a long-running story, not acute crisis moments that spike interest.

3. **Recent 7-day trend** - Google Trends data shows decline from 83.6 to 76.3 average. Demonstrates existing downward momentum, though sample size is limited.

**Weak Evidence:**

1. **India CDS visit** - The Tribune reports this visit, but it's a bilateral defense matter with limited broader news appeal. No evidence of significant media amplification.

2. **Azerbaijan-Armenia trade data** - Trend News reports $2.4M January exports. This is positive normalization news but too technical/economic to drive search interest.

3. **Parliamentary election preparations** - Scheduled for June 7, but we're still 3.5 months away. Campaign activities are unlikely to generate significant search interest in late February.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 11 days (Feb 17-28, 2026)

**Current position in decay cycle:**
- Day 7 post-Vance visit peak (Feb 10 = 100, Feb 17 = 90)
- Historical diplomatic events show 7-14 day decay to baseline
- We're at midpoint of typical decay window

**If timeframe were halved (5-6 days, Feb 17-23):**
- Would increase probability of "Doesn't change" to ~30-35%
- Decay might not complete fully in shorter window
- Still expect decline but possibly within ±3 threshold
- Decreases: 50%, Doesn't change: 35%, Increases: 15%

**If timeframe were doubled (22 days, Feb 17-Mar 11):**
- Would significantly increase probability of "Decreases" to ~75-80%
- Longer window ensures completion of decay cycle
- Approaches baseline (70.1) with high confidence
- Also increases risk of new unexpected events (parliamentary campaign developments, diplomatic incidents)
- Decreases: 75%, Doesn't change: 15%, Increases: 10%

**Current 11-day window assessment:**
- Sufficient time for substantial decay (likely 10-20 point drop)
- Long enough to exceed ±3 threshold for "Decreases"
- Short enough that unexpected events remain relatively unlikely

## (d) Justification

**Base rate from outside view:** Decreases 65%, Doesn't change 20%, Increases 15%

**Factors supporting larger shift toward "Decreases":**

1. **Structural decay momentum** - We are definitively in a post-spike decay phase. The Vance visit (Feb 10) is now 7 days past, and Google Trends value has already declined from 100 to 90. Historical precedent shows diplomatic events decay 70-80% within 14 days. With 11 days remaining in our window, we should expect continued decline of 15-25 points, easily exceeding the ±3 threshold.

2. **Event vacuum** - The agent report's systematic calendar review found no scheduled events Feb 17-28. This is critical because spikes require catalysts. The visa policy news is already priced in (effective since Jan 1), and parliamentary election preparations won't intensify until April-May.

3. **Multiple convergent indicators** - Recent 7-day trend declining, value elevated above mean, post-spike timing, and absence of catalysts all point in same direction. This convergence of independent factors strengthens confidence.

**Factors supporting shift toward "Doesn't change":**

1. **Potential stabilization** - The visa policy announcement and ongoing Armenia-Russia tensions could provide a "floor" of baseline interest around 85-90 range, preventing further decline. However, this contradicts historical patterns where diplomatic events return to baseline (70.1) rather than establishing new elevated baselines.

2. **Incremental news flow** - Daily developments in Armenia-Russia relations, Azerbaijan trade, or TRIPP project could maintain elevated interest. However, these are not acute crisis moments and historically don't sustain elevated search volumes.

**Factors supporting "Increases":**

1. **Unexpected events** - Parliamentary election controversy, Armenia-Azerbaijan border incident, or major diplomatic announcement could spike interest. However, 11-day window provides limited opportunity, and no indicators suggest imminent developments.

2. **Visa policy amplification** - If major travel media outlets amplify the visa exemption story, could drive search interest. However, policy has been active for 6 weeks without such amplification.

**Calibration decision:**

The outside view base rate of 65% for "Decreases" appears well-justified and possibly conservative. The structural factors (post-spike decay, mean reversion, event vacuum) are exceptionally strong and align with historical patterns. The convergence of multiple independent indicators (current decay momentum, distance from mean, calendar review, historical precedent) provides high confidence.

However, I must consider:
- Google Trends shows inherent volatility (daily fluctuations of ±5-10 points are common)
- The ±3 threshold is relatively narrow
- 11 days provides some opportunity for unexpected developments

Given these considerations, I'll make a modest adjustment from the outside view:
- Slightly increase "Decreases" to 70% (strong structural factors justify higher confidence)
- Reduce "Doesn't change" to 18% (stabilization seems unlikely given momentum)
- Reduce "Increases" to 12% (unexpected events remain possible but unlikely in 11-day window)

## Probability Calibration

**Status quo continuation:** If current decay trend continues linearly (90 → ~75-80 by Feb 28), this clearly exceeds ±3 threshold for "Decreases."

**Distribution calibration:**
- At 70% for "Decreases," I'm asserting 7:3 odds that value drops >3 points from Feb 17 baseline
- At 18% for "Doesn't change," I'm asserting ~1:5 odds that value stays within 87-93 range
- At 12% for "Increases," I'm asserting ~1:8 odds that value rises above 93

**Sensitivity check:**
- If I shifted to 80% "Decreases," I'd be claiming 4:1 odds, which seems overconfident given Google Trends volatility
- If I shifted to 60% "Decreases," I'd be underweighting the strong structural factors
- 70% represents appropriate confidence given strong but not deterministic evidence

**Final calibration:** Decreases 70%, Doesn't change 18%, Increases 12%

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Google Trends value for "armenia" on Feb 28 compared to Feb 17. Resolves "Decreases" if >3 points lower, "Doesn't change" if within ±3, "Increases" if >3 points higher.

2. **Base rate:** Outside view established 65% Decreases, 20% Doesn't change, 15% Increases. My final prediction (70%/18%/12%) is anchored to this with modest adjustments based on strong structural evidence.

3. **Consistency check:** Most likely = Decreases (70%); Least likely = Increases (12%). This aligns with post-spike decay momentum, absence of catalysts, and mean reversion pressure. Makes sense.

4. **Significant evidence:**
   - Post-spike decay: Day 7 of typical 7-14 day cycle, value already declining 100→90
   - Event vacuum: No scheduled events Feb 17-28 per systematic calendar review
   - Mean reversion: Current value (90) is 2.1 SD above mean (70.1)
   - Recent momentum: 7-day average declining from 83.6 to 76.3
   - Historical precedent: Diplomatic events consistently return to baseline within 14 days

5. **Blind-spot:** Unexpected geopolitical crisis (Armenia-Azerbaijan border clash, major diplomatic incident, or election controversy) could spike interest and make "Increases" outcome occur. This would require acute, breaking news event within 11-day window. If this occurred, my 12% for "Increases" would look too low. However, absence of indicators and short timeframe make this unlikely.

6. **Status quo:** Current status quo is active decay from recent spike. Volatility is moderate (typical ±5-10 daily fluctuations). The 11-day timeframe is sufficient for meaningful trend development. Given strong decay momentum, status quo continuation favors "Decreases" rather than stability.

7. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, all between 0-100, no % signs.
