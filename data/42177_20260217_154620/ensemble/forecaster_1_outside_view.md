Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**1. Caliber.az (Feb 17, 2026)** - Azerbaijani source discussing Armenia-Azerbaijan peace process, constitutional reforms, and economic cooperation. While the article contains factual information about fuel deliveries and ministerial statements, it presents a perspective favorable to Azerbaijan. The timing is current (today) and discusses ongoing developments. Quality: Medium - useful for facts but requires awareness of potential bias.

**2. Jam-news.net (Feb 16, 2026)** - Reports on third "Bridge of Peace" meeting in Armenia with Armenian and Azerbaijani experts. Contains verifiable facts about the meeting dates, participants, and the symbolic border crossing. Named sources include political analysts and journalists. Quality: Good - recent, specific, and includes multiple named sources.

**3. RAND Corporation (Jan 12, 2026)** - Analytical piece on peace prospects. Key factual claim: neither country has signed the August 2025 agreement as of January 2026. Notes constitutional referendum slated for 2027 and parliamentary elections in 2026. Quality: High - reputable think tank, though slightly dated (5 weeks old).

**4. Times of India (Feb 17, 2026)** - Reports Armenia's visa-free policy for Indians with specific residence permits, effective Jan 1 - Jul 1, 2026. This is a tourism/travel story with limited geopolitical significance. Quality: Medium - factual but narrow scope.

**5. Al Jazeera (Feb 10, 2026)** - Reports US-Armenia civil nuclear cooperation agreement signed during VP Vance's visit. Factual details about $5 billion initial exports and $4 billion longer-term contracts. Quality: High - major news outlet, recent, verifiable facts.

**6. The Guardian (Feb 11, 2026)** - Reports White House deletion of JD Vance's "Armenian genocide" social media post. Multiple named sources from Armenian-American organizations expressing criticism. Quality: High - recent, well-documented incident with multiple sources.

**7. Agent Report** - Comprehensive analysis of historical Google Trends patterns for "armenia" over 2019-2026. Identifies key spike patterns: April 24 genocide commemorations (50-70 range, 48-72h decay), Sept 2022 border clashes (1 week elevation), Sept 2023 Nagorno-Karabakh crisis (largest spike, 2-week decay), Aug 2025 peace deal (sharp but brief). Notes no major scheduled events for Feb 17-28, 2026. Quality: High - systematic historical analysis.

**8. Google Trends Data** - Shows current value at 90 (Feb 17), with recent spike to 100 on Feb 10 (likely related to Vance visit). Base rate analysis shows 28% "no change" (±3), 42% increase, 30% decrease over 11-day windows. Recent 7-day trend is decreasing (76.3 vs 83.6). Quality: High - direct empirical data.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **All 11-day windows in past 90 days** - Base rates: 28% no change, 42% increase, 30% decrease. Suitability: Good - matches exact timeframe and captures general volatility patterns.

2. **Post-spike decay patterns** - After major events (Vance visit peaked Feb 10), interest typically decays within 4-14 days depending on event type. Suitability: Excellent - we're currently in a post-spike period (Feb 10 peak = 100, Feb 17 = 90).

3. **Diplomatic event aftermath** - Aug 2025 peace deal showed sharp peak followed by normalization within 7 days. Suitability: Very Good - similar diplomatic/political event type.

4. **Periods without scheduled major events** - Agent report notes 14 of 17 ten-day windows without conflict/commemoration stayed within ±2 range. Suitability: Excellent - no major events scheduled Feb 17-28.

**Most suitable reference class:** Post-spike decay patterns combined with periods without scheduled major events.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 11 days (Feb 17 to Feb 28, 2026)

**Current situation (Feb 17):**
- Value is 90, down from peak of 100 on Feb 10 (7 days ago)
- Recent 7-day average (76.3) is lower than prior 7-day average (83.6)
- We are in day 7-8 of post-Vance-visit decay

**Historical patterns for similar periods:**
- Diplomatic events (Aug 2025 peace deal): normalized within 7 days, dropping to ≤30% of peak
- VP Vance visit (Feb 10 peak): typical diplomatic event, should follow similar pattern
- By day 7 post-spike, values typically fall to 30-40% of peak
- Agent report: "After every spike, search interest reliably returns to its pre-event 'background' band (index 8-18) within two weeks"

**Expected trajectory:**
- Current value (90) is still elevated relative to 90-day mean (70.1)
- If following typical diplomatic-event decay, should continue declining toward baseline
- No scheduled events Feb 17-28 to reverse this trend
- Parliamentary election preparations are procedural, historically don't generate sustained interest

## (d) Justification

The current Google Trends value of 90 represents the tail end of a spike triggered by VP Vance's visit (Feb 10 peak = 100). Historical patterns show diplomatic events produce sharp but brief elevations that normalize within 7 days. We are now at day 7-8 of this decay cycle.

Key factors supporting a decrease:
1. **Established decay pattern**: All similar diplomatic events show continued decline after day 7
2. **No new catalysts**: Agent report confirms no major scheduled events Feb 17-28
3. **Recent trend**: Last 7 days already showing decline (76.3 vs 83.6)
4. **Mean reversion**: Current value (90) significantly above 90-day mean (70.1)

Key factors supporting stability:
1. **Parliamentary election preparations**: Ongoing but historically low-impact
2. **Peace process developments**: Incremental news could maintain baseline interest
3. **Natural volatility**: Google Trends shows day-to-day fluctuations

Key factors supporting increase:
1. **Unexpected events**: Conflict, major announcements, or election controversies
2. **Historical base rate**: 42% of 11-day windows show increases >3 points

The most probable scenario is continued decay toward the 90-day mean (70.1), which would represent a decrease of ~20 points from current value (90). Even a partial decline to 75-80 range would exceed the ±3 threshold for "Decreases."

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring to established distributions:**
- Base rate from 90-day data: 30% decrease, 28% no change, 42% increase
- However, this base rate doesn't account for current context (post-spike decay phase)

**Adjustments for context:**
1. **Post-spike position**: We're 7 days into a decay cycle. Historical precedent shows diplomatic events return to baseline within 7-14 days. This strongly favors continued decline.

2. **Distance from mean**: Current value (90) is 2.1 standard deviations above mean (70.1). Mean reversion pressure is strong.

3. **Recent momentum**: 7-day trend already decreasing, supporting continuation.

4. **Event calendar**: No scheduled catalysts to reverse decline or create new spike.

**Probability calibration:**

The base rate of 30% for "Decreases" is too low given we're in an active decay phase. Historical analysis shows:
- 14 of 17 calm ten-day windows stayed within ±2 (not ±3)
- Post-diplomatic-event periods show consistent decline
- Current elevated position (90 vs mean 70.1) creates strong reversion pressure

Adjusting for these factors:
- **Decreases**: Should be 60-70% (strong decay momentum + no new catalysts)
- **Doesn't change**: Should be 15-25% (would require stabilization at elevated level, uncommon)
- **Increases**: Should be 10-20% (would require unexpected event)

**Upset rate consideration:**
The domain shows moderate unpredictability due to potential for sudden geopolitical events. However, the 11-day window and current post-spike context reduce this uncertainty. Historical upset rate in calm periods is ~15-20%.

**Final calibration:**
Given strong structural factors favoring decline (post-spike decay, mean reversion, no catalysts) but acknowledging some residual uncertainty, I calibrate:
- Decreases: 65%
- Doesn't change: 20%
- Increases: 15%

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 15%
Doesn't change: 20%
Decreases: 65%
