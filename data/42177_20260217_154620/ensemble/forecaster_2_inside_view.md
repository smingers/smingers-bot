Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources:**

1. **GEOpolitics (Feb 8, 2026)** - Detailed article on Armenia-Azerbaijan peace talks. Factual coverage of treaty timeline, Washington summit (Aug 8, 2025), and TRIPP agreement. Contains one opinion from unnamed "Azerbaijani experts" about June 2026 elections affecting ratification. High quality for factual timeline, lower for speculative elements.

2. **OC Media (Jan 20, 2026)** - Armenian intelligence assessment stating war "highly unlikely" in 2026. Factual reporting of official government assessment. High credibility for stated positions, though inherently forward-looking.

3. **Caucasus Watch (Feb 17, 2026)** - Expert interview with Dr. Benyamin Poghosyan (identifiable expert from Applied Policy Research Institute). Discusses TRIPP construction timeline (second half 2026), U.S.-Iran tensions, and regional dynamics. Moderate-high quality; expert opinions clearly attributed.

4. **News.az (Feb 17, 2026)** - Opinion piece by Azerbaijani journalist Zaur Nurmamedov. Pro-Azerbaijan perspective on France-Azerbaijan tensions and TRIPP. Factual elements (Macron statements, COP29) verifiable, but analysis is opinion. Low-moderate quality for neutral analysis.

15. **Historical articles (Nov 2025, Sep 2025)** - Tourism interest data and earlier diplomatic developments. Contextual but dated.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **JD Vance visit (Feb 10, 2026)**: Multiple independent sources confirm U.S. Vice President visited both Baku and Yerevan, signing U.S.-Azerbaijan Strategic Partnership Charter. This is the highest-level U.S. visit to Armenia ever and to Azerbaijan since 2008. The visit occurred 7 days before forecast opening (Feb 17), placing it just outside the resolution window but within the 30-day Google Trends baseline period that determines the Feb 17 starting value of 95.
- **Current Google Trends value = 95**: The question states Armenia interest is at 95 on Feb 16, 2026, which is near-peak (100 = maximum). This high starting point is crucial.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Visa exemption policy (effective Jan 1 - July 1, 2026)**: Multiple sources confirm Armenia implemented temporary visa-free travel for 113 countries including USA, EU, GCC states. This is a sustained tourism promotion effort, not a one-time event.
- **TRIPP project construction timeline**: Expert source (Dr. Poghosyan) states construction expected to begin "second half of 2026," meaning no major groundbreaking events likely in Feb 17-28 window.
- **Armenian parliamentary elections (June 7, 2026)**: Multiple sources reference upcoming elections, but this is 3.5 months after forecast window.
- **Russia-Armenia tensions**: Multiple sources document ongoing diplomatic friction (Russian FM statements Feb 5, Feb 16; Armenian PM statements Feb 13), but this is ongoing slow-burn tension, not acute crisis.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Trade normalization with Azerbaijan**: January 2026 exports reported, but this is gradual economic integration, not newsworthy spike material.
- **India CDS visit**: Mentioned but timing unclear; likely early February, already reflected in baseline.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 11 days (Feb 17-28, 2026)

**Key temporal factors:**
1. **Starting value = 95**: The Feb 17 value is already elevated (95th percentile of recent 30-day period), likely reflecting the JD Vance visit on Feb 10. Google Trends values typically decay after news events.
2. **No scheduled major events**: Review of all sources reveals no confirmed Armenia-related events scheduled for Feb 17-28. Parliamentary elections are June 7 (3.5 months away), TRIPP construction is "second half 2026."
3. **Decay pattern**: Historical analysis shows spikes typically decay over 5-10 days. The Vance visit spike (value=100 on Feb 10) has had 7 days to decay by Feb 17, reaching 95. An additional 11 days (to Feb 28) would allow further decay.

**If timeframe were halved (5-6 days)**: Less time for decay; higher probability of "Doesn't change" outcome.

**If timeframe were doubled (22 days)**: More time for decay to baseline; higher probability of "Decreases" outcome. Also increases chance of unexpected news event.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view base rates**: Increases 40%, Doesn't change 29%, Decreases 31%

**Key factors warranting adjustment:**

1. **Exceptionally high starting value (95)**: The outside view 90-day reference class includes many periods starting from lower values (median likely 40-60 range). Starting from 95 means:
   - Less headroom for increases (can only go to 100, a +5 gain)
   - More room for decreases (can drop to 0, though realistically 50-80 range)
   - Natural regression to mean favors decrease

2. **Recent spike with known cause**: The 95 value reflects a specific news event (Vance visit Feb 10) that is now 7-17 days old during the forecast window. Historical pattern shows post-event decay. This is **strong evidence** for decrease.

3. **Absence of scheduled catalysts**: No major Armenia-related events are scheduled for Feb 17-28. Visa policy is already in effect (started Jan 1), TRIPP construction is months away, elections are June. This reduces probability of increases.

4. **Decay mechanics**: The question background explains Google Trends rescaling. With a fixed date range (Jan 29 - Feb 28), the Feb 10 spike (100) serves as the anchor. As time passes without new spikes, relative values typically decline. The Feb 17 value of 95 is already 5 points below peak; by Feb 28 (18 days post-peak), further decay is likely.

**Counterarguments:**
- Visa policy could generate sustained elevated interest (moderate evidence)
- Unexpected news event could occur (but base rate for this is already in the 40% "increase" category)
- Russia-Armenia tensions could escalate (weak evidence; no imminent crisis indicators)

**Calibration logic:**
The outside view 40/29/31 split was derived from all 11-day windows in the 90-day period, many starting from moderate values. The current situation—starting from 95 after a known spike—is **structurally different** from the typical reference class member. This warrants significant adjustment.

Specifically:
- **Decreases**: Should increase from 31% to ~50-55% due to decay dynamics and high starting point
- **Doesn't change**: Should decrease from 29% to ~20-25% because staying within ±3 points of 95 requires either sustained high interest or perfectly balanced forces
- **Increases**: Should decrease from 40% to ~20-25% due to limited headroom and absence of catalysts

## Probability Calibration

**Inside view prediction:**

Starting from outside view (40/29/31), I adjust for:

1. **High starting value (95) + post-spike decay pattern**: Strong evidence for decrease. Shift -15% from Increases, +20% to Decreases.
2. **No scheduled catalysts in Feb 17-28 window**: Moderate evidence against increases. Shift -5% from Increases.
3. **Sustained visa policy effect**: Weak-moderate evidence for elevated baseline, but this is already reflected in the 95 value. Minimal adjustment (+2% to Doesn't change).

**Adjusted probabilities:**
- Increases: 40% - 15% - 5% = **20%**
- Doesn't change: 29% + 2% = **31%**
- Decreases: 31% + 20% = **51%**

However, checking against the 90-day empirical data: when starting from high values (>85), decreases occurred in ~55% of cases (rough estimate from the decay pattern described). This supports my 51% estimate.

**Final calibration check**: 
- 20% for increases means 1-in-5 chance of unexpected positive news or sustained elevated interest
- 31% for no change means roughly 1-in-3 chance the value stays 92-98 range
- 51% for decreases means slightly better than even odds that decay continues

This distribution feels appropriately calibrated to the evidence: decrease is most likely due to decay dynamics, but there's meaningful probability mass on stability (31%) and surprise increases (20%).

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Armenia Google Trends value (US, Feb 28) be >3 points higher, within ±3, or >3 points lower than Feb 17 value (currently 95)?

2. **Base rate**: Outside view was 40/29/31 (Inc/NoChange/Dec). My final 20/31/49 is rooted in this but adjusted for high starting value and decay pattern.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = Decreases (49%); Least likely = Increases (20%). Makes sense given high starting point (95) after recent spike and no scheduled catalysts.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Feb 17 value is 95, near-peak after Vance visit Feb 10 (strong, factual)
   - No major Armenia events scheduled Feb 17-28 (strong, verified across sources)
   - Historical decay pattern after news spikes (moderate, from agent report)
   - Limited headroom for increases (5 points max) vs. large room for decreases (strong, mathematical)

5. **Blind spot**: Unexpected major news event (e.g., sudden Armenia-Azerbaijan border incident, major U.S. announcement on TRIPP, Russia-Armenia crisis escalation) could spike interest. This would favor "Increases." Probability ~15-20%, already captured in my 20% for increases.

6. **Status quo**: Current status quo is elevated interest (95) decaying from recent spike. Natural trajectory is gradual decrease. My 49% for decrease aligns with this.

7. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, all between 0-100, no % signs.
