Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**1. Caliber.az (Feb 17, 2026)** - Azerbaijani source covering Armenia-Azerbaijan peace process. Reports on constitutional reform timeline (6 months for new constitution, text by March), economic benefits from peace, and Pashinyan's commitment to sign peace treaty before parliamentary elections. Quality: Medium - appears to be advocacy journalism from Azerbaijani perspective. Contains factual information about statements and trade figures but presents them through a particular lens.

**2. Jam-news (Feb 16, 2026)** - Reports on third "Bridge of Peace" meeting in Tsaghkadzor (Feb 13-14). Notable for documenting Azerbaijani delegation crossing land border on foot - described as "historic" and "symbolic." Quality: Good - appears to be balanced regional reporting with named sources and specific details about the peace dialogue initiative.

**3. RAND Corporation (Jan 12, 2026)** - Analysis piece noting the August 2025 peace agreement remains unsigned, constitutional obstacles requiring 2027 referendum, and 2026 parliamentary elections creating uncertainty. Discusses Russian interference and geopolitical dynamics. Quality: High - reputable think tank with expert analysis, though this is opinion/analysis rather than breaking news.

**4. Times of India (Feb 17, 2026)** - Reports Armenia's temporary visa-free policy for Indians with specific residence permits (Jan 1 - July 1, 2026). Quality: Medium - straightforward reporting of policy announcement, factual but not directly relevant to U.S. search interest.

**5. Al Jazeera (Feb 10, 2026)** - Reports U.S.-Armenia civil nuclear cooperation agreement signed during VP Vance's visit, potentially worth $5-9 billion. First visit by sitting U.S. president/VP to Armenia. Quality: High - major international news outlet reporting significant geopolitical development.

**6. The Guardian (Feb 11, 2026)** - Reports White House deletion of Vance's social media post referring to "Armenian genocide" during his Armenia visit, generating controversy. Includes reactions from Armenian-American advocacy groups. Quality: High - reputable source documenting a controversy that likely drove U.S. search interest.

**7. Agent Report on Historical Google Trends** - Comprehensive analysis of past spikes: April 24 (genocide remembrance), Sept 2022 (border clashes + Pelosi visit), Sept 2023 (Karabakh offensive), Aug 2025 (peace deal). Notes spikes typically last 3-14 days depending on event type, with baseline restoration within two weeks. Quality: High - systematic historical analysis directly relevant to forecasting question.

**8. Google Trends Data** - Shows current value of 90 on Feb 17, with recent spike to 100 on Feb 10 (coinciding with Vance visit/nuclear deal), followed by decline. 90-day mean: 70.1. Base rates: 42% increase, 30% decrease, 28% no change over 11-day windows. Quality: High - primary data source for the question.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Post-major-event decay periods**
- Most relevant: We are currently in the decay phase following the Feb 10 spike (Vance visit/nuclear deal)
- Historical pattern: Major diplomatic events (like Aug 2025 peace deal) produce 4-7 day elevated periods
- The Feb 10 spike reached 100, and by Feb 17 we're at 90 (7 days later)
- Agent report shows these typically return to baseline within 7-14 days
- Suitability: HIGH - this directly matches our current situation

**Reference Class 2: Periods without scheduled major events**
- Agent report notes 14 out of 17 ten-day windows without conflict/commemoration stayed within ±2 range
- No fixed-date commemoration, peace anniversary, or conflict date falls in Feb 17-28
- Suitability: MEDIUM-HIGH - applicable but must account for ongoing decay from recent spike

**Reference Class 3: Election-related news periods**
- Parliamentary elections scheduled for June 7, 2026
- Electoral registration ongoing, but historically these procedural matters don't generate sustained U.S. interest
- Suitability: LOW - elections are months away and procedural news rarely drives U.S. searches

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 11 days (Feb 17 to Feb 28, 2026)

**Current context:**
- Starting value: 90 (Feb 17)
- Recent peak: 100 (Feb 10) - 7 days ago
- We are in day 7-18 of the post-Vance-visit decay period

**Historical decay patterns:**
- Diplomatic events typically return to baseline (60s-70s range) within 7-14 days
- The Aug 2025 peace deal peaked at ~55 and normalized within 7 days
- The Feb 10 spike was larger (100) but followed similar diplomatic news pattern
- Current 90-day baseline: 70.1 (±9.6 std dev)

**Recent trajectory:**
- Feb 10: 100 (peak)
- Feb 11: 84 (sharp drop, likely related to genocide post controversy)
- Feb 12-15: 64-71 (stabilizing near baseline)
- Feb 16-17: 91, 90 (slight uptick, possibly noise or residual interest)

**Expected pattern for Feb 17-28:**
- If following typical decay: should continue trending toward 70.1 baseline
- From 90 to ~70 would be a decrease of ~20 points over 11 days
- However, Google Trends rescaling can create apparent stability or small fluctuations

## (d) Justification

The current Google Trends value of 90 represents the tail end of elevated interest from VP Vance's Feb 9-10 visit to Armenia, which included the nuclear cooperation agreement announcement and the genocide post controversy. This combination of major U.S. diplomatic engagement and domestic controversy created the largest spike in the recent period (100 on Feb 10).

Seven days into the decay period, we're at 90 - still elevated above the 90-day mean of 70.1 but showing the expected downward trend. Historical patterns strongly suggest continued decay toward baseline over the next 11 days, as:

1. No major scheduled events fall within Feb 17-28 that match the characteristics of past spike-generators
2. Diplomatic event spikes typically fully resolve within 7-14 days
3. The parliamentary election preparations are procedural and months away
4. The "Bridge of Peace" meeting (Feb 13-14) did not generate observable U.S. search interest

The key question is whether the value will drop by more than 3 points (to ≤87) by Feb 28, stay within ±3 (87-93), or somehow increase above 93.

**Factors favoring decrease:**
- Natural decay from Feb 10 spike
- 7 days already elapsed with downward trend visible
- No upcoming events to sustain interest
- Historical precedent: diplomatic spikes don't maintain elevation for 18+ days

**Factors favoring stability:**
- Current value (90) already near the threshold
- Google Trends rescaling can create apparent stability
- Base rate shows 28% of 11-day windows stay within ±3

**Factors favoring increase:**
- Would require new major news event
- Possible but no scheduled catalysts identified
- Base rate shows 42% increase, but this includes periods starting from baseline, not from elevated positions

The most probable scenario is continued decay from the current elevated position toward the 70.1 baseline, resulting in a decrease of >3 points by Feb 28.

## Outside view calibration:

The base rate data shows 42% increase, 28% no change, 30% decrease over 11-day windows. However, this base rate includes all starting positions - both baseline and elevated. Our current situation is specific: we're starting from an elevated position (90) that is 7 days post-spike.

When filtering for similar contexts (post-event decay periods), historical precedent strongly favors continued decrease. The Aug 2025 peace deal returned to baseline within 7 days; we're now at day 7 of a similar pattern.

The ±3 threshold is relatively narrow given the volatility shown in the daily values (standard deviation of 9.6). A move from 90 to 87 or below seems more likely than maintaining 87-93 or increasing above 93.

Calibration considerations:
- Historical decay patterns are consistent and strong
- No identified catalysts for reversal or sustained elevation
- The 42% base rate for increases is misleading when applied to post-spike decay periods
- Google Trends rescaling could create ±2-3 point noise, but unlikely to fully prevent decay over 11 days
- Small probability (~10-15%) of unexpected news event (election controversy, border incident, U.S. policy announcement)
