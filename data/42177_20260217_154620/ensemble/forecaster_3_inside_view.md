Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-28 (US Google Trends, fixed range in URL), compare the daily value on 2/28 vs 2/17: “Doesn’t change” if within ±3; otherwise “Increases” (>+3) or “Decreases” (<-3).

2) Outside view base rate distribution (given)
Increases 15 / Doesn’t change 20 / Decreases 65.

(a) Source analysis (what each says, quality, date)
- GEOpolitics (Feb 8, 2026) on Armenia–Azerbaijan peace talks/TRIPP: mostly descriptive but with some anonymous/advocacy-flavored claims (e.g., ratification timing). Medium quality; relevant as background, not a likely US search spike driver by itself.
- OC Media (Jan 20, 2026) citing Armenia’s Foreign Intelligence Service report: “war highly unlikely,” hybrid threats ahead of elections. Good quality; suggests lower probability of sudden war-driven search spike in this short window.
- Caucasus Watch (Feb 17, 2026) analysis of US–Armenia relations/TRIPP and regional dynamics. Medium-high quality analysis; could contribute to ongoing attention but is niche.
- News.az opinion (undated in summary; context recent) about France/Azerbaijan/Armenia: clearly advocacy opinion. Low weight for US search interest.
- CFR elections-to-watch (Dec 9, 2025): irrelevant to Armenia search interest. High quality but not pertinent.
- Jamnews South Ossetia (Feb 16, 2026): not directly Armenia-focused. Good quality but likely minimal effect.
AskNews set (mostly Feb 15–17, 2026):
- Day.Az pieces (Feb 17): Azerbaijani outlet; partially commentary. Low-medium reliability; limited direct effect on US searches.
- The Tribune (Feb 16): English-language commentary tying Vance + India defense visit + TRIPP. Medium quality; could modestly sustain interest.
- Trend News Agency (Feb 16) on exports to Armenia: narrow business item; low effect on broad US searches.
- Time Out (Feb 16) on Armenia visa exemption (travel angle): mainstream travel media; could create some incremental US curiosity/searches. Medium relevance.
- Korrespondent / UA Korrespondent (Feb 16) on Armenia refusing to extradite Russian political fugitives: plausible news hook; medium relevance but primarily regional audience.
- Nouvelles d’Arménie (Feb 16) summarizing TASS/Russian MFA line on Armenia-West: medium reliability for “Russia said X”; limited US mass-search impact.
- bne IntelliNews (Feb 15) on Pashinyan balancing Russia/EU: reputable business/politics coverage; moderate relevance.
(From your outside-view writeup) prior major-driver items:
- Vance Armenia/AZ trip, nuclear cooperation, “genocide” wording controversy (reported by major outlets in your outside-view set): high-quality and demonstrably spike-capable; but those events are now in the past relative to the Feb 17–28 window start.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence
- Post-spike mean reversion / decay pattern: interest was recently at a peak (100 on ~Feb 10 per your outside-view), and these diplomatic-news spikes usually decay within ~1–2 weeks. This directly predicts downward drift by Feb 28.
- Structural “no scheduled mega-catalyst” inside the window: no fixed-date commemoration (e.g., April 24 genocide remembrance) or known scheduled signing that reliably produces US-wide search surges.

Moderate evidence
- Multiple contemporaneous articles (Feb 15–17) indicate continuing—but lower-intensity—coverage: TRIPP corridor debate, Russia–Armenia tension, travel visa easing. This could slow the decay and raise the chance of “Doesn’t change” (staying within ±3) relative to a pure decay model.
- OC Media assessment “war highly unlikely” in 2026: reduces likelihood of a sudden conflict spike in this narrow 11-day window.

Weak evidence
- Azerbaijan/France/Armenia opinion pieces and trade-stat micro-stories: unlikely to move broad US Google Trends for the generic term “armenia”.
- South Ossetia domestic politics: indirect at best.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Window length: 11 days (Feb 17 to Feb 28).
- If halved (~5–6 days): “Doesn’t change” would become more plausible because decay might not move >3 points quickly (and day-to-day noise can keep it near the start value).
- If doubled (~22 days): “Decreases” would become more likely because mean reversion has more time to pull interest back toward baseline absent a new shock.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment from outside view)
Status quo continuation is “cooling off” from a recent high-attention diplomatic/controversy episode. To resolve “Increases,” Feb 28 must be >93 if Feb 17 is ~90 (per outside-view). That typically requires a fresh, high-salience event (border violence, major US statement/action, dramatic treaty signing breakdown, etc.). The current news flow looks more like follow-on analysis and secondary angles (TRIPP details, Russia rhetoric, travel policy), which can slow the fade but usually don’t recreate a near-peak surge.

So I keep “Decreases” as the modal outcome, but I allocate non-trivial mass to “Doesn’t change” because: (i) the threshold is narrow (±3), (ii) Google Trends daily values can be “sticky” when the reference period includes a very recent peak, and (iii) there is still a cluster of Armenia-related coverage in mid-February.

Probability calibration
- Baseline (outside view): [15, 20, 65].
- Adjustment: modestly increase “Decreases” because starting from an elevated post-peak level makes a >3 drop over 11 days more likely than in a random 11-day window; slightly reduce “Increases” because it needs a new shock; keep “Doesn’t change” somewhat below outside view because a ±3 band is tight over 11 days.

Checklist:
1. Criteria/options check: Compare 2/28 vs 2/17 on the fixed-date Trends URL; ±3 => Doesn’t change; else increase/decrease. OK.
2. Outside view anchor: [15,20,65] used as anchor. OK.
3. Consistency check: Most likely = Decreases; least likely = Increases; aligned with decay + lack of catalysts. OK.
4. Key evidence (most important):
   - Recent peak-driven attention is likely to decay further by Feb 28.
   - No scheduled major Armenia event in-window comparable to known spike drivers.
   - Ongoing but lower-intensity TRIPP/Russia/travel coverage may slow (not reverse) decay.
   - “War highly unlikely” assessment reduces shock-spike risk.
5. Blind spot: An unexpected border incident, major US/Israel/Iran-related development involving Armenia/TRIPP, or a high-profile US political controversy could spike searches and flip to “Increases.” This mainly shifts mass from Decreases to Increases.
6. Status quo outcome: gradual normalization down from elevated level → Decreases. OK.
7. Technicalities: integers 0–100 sum to 100. OK.
