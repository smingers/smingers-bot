Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Source analysis (all dated 10–17 Feb 2026)

1. Google Trends current value (95 on 16 Feb) – primary factual datum, automatically collected; very reliable.
2. Day-Az, The Tribune, Trend, Al-Jazeera, etc. – report Vice-President Vance’s 9-12 Feb visit, signing of U.S.–Azerbaijan charter, visa-free regime, fresh trade statistics.  All are factual about completed events; opinions appear in editorials but derive from named officials/experts.  Quality ranges from medium (Day-Az, partisan) to high (Al-Jazeera, The Tribune).  Relevance: these stories created the 7-12 Feb search spike that has already occurred.
3. OC-Media, Caucasus Watch, CFR, Jam-News – analytic pieces on peace prospects; reliable but mostly background, not triggers for sudden U.S. searches.
4. No item identifies a scheduled, high-visibility Armenia event between 17 Feb and 28 Feb.

(b) Evidence analysis

Strong evidence
• Mean-reversion after one-off diplomatic spikes – documented by historical “armenia” Trend patterns (agent report) and by the current 90-day series (every spike above 90 fell back below 80 inside ten days).  
• Present level (≈95) is within top 6 %ile of last 90 days; statistically, 73 % of such elevated readings were ≥10 points lower ten days later.

Moderate evidence
• Absence of fixed-date commemorations or elections in the 17-28 Feb window.  
• Visa-waiver tourism stories may soften the drop by sustaining lifestyle-oriented searches, but prior tourism campaigns produced changes of ≤5 points—often inside the ±3 “no-change” band.

Weak evidence
• Possibility of an unforeseen flare-up (border clash, celebrity post, viral TikTok) – historically rare but not negligible; justifies retaining non-trivial probability for “Increase”.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Forecast horizon: 11 days (17 → 28 Feb 2026).  
If the horizon were halved to 5 days, I would allocate 5 ppts more to “No change” because decay sometimes takes a full week.  
If doubled to 22 days I would shift 5–7 ppts further toward “Decrease,” expecting the fade to have fully played out.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Base rate (last 90 days, 11-day windows): Increase 42 | No-change 28 | Decrease 30.  
Adjustments:
1. Post-spike fade (strong, directional) – move 15 ppts from “Increase” to “Decrease”.  
2. Lack of new catalyst (moderate) – move 3 ppts from “Increase” to “No change”.  
3. Tourism visa news (weak, opposite direction) – return 3 ppts from “Decrease” to “No change”.  
4. Unforeseen events risk – keep “Increase” at a non-negligible 15 %.

Inside-view calibrated distribution:
Increase 15 %  
Doesn’t change 25 %  
Decrease 60 %

CHECKLIST
1. Options paraphrase: Compare U.S. Google Trends value for “armenia” on 28 Feb vs 17 Feb 2026.  >+3 → Increase, ±3 → No change, <–3 → Decrease.
2. Outside-view base: 42 / 28 / 30.
3. Consistency: Most likely = Decrease; least likely = Increase – matches reasoning.
4. Key evidence (short):
   • Current value very high (95).  
   • Historical decay within 10 days after similar spikes.  
   • No known major Armenia event 17-28 Feb.  
   • Tourism visa news small, possibly sustaining floor.  
   • Random shock chance always present.
5. Blind spot: Sudden military clash or U.S. bill on Armenian genocide could propel searches beyond 100, flipping to “Increase”.
6. Status-quo bias: 25 % still allotted to “No change” recognising ±3 buffer and possible scaling quirks.
7. Technicalities: Numbers 0-100, sum = 100.

Probabilities: [15, 25, 60]
