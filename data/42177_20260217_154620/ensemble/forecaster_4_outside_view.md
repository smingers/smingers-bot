Analysis:

a)  Source analysis  
1. GoogleTrendsData dump (17 Feb 2026).  
   – Factual daily index values for “armenia” in the United States, last 90 days, plus a simple base-rate study covering every rolling 11-day window in that 90-day set.  
   – No evident bias; the data come straight from Google Trends.  Date is current.  
2. Agent report on long-run spikes (issued 16 Feb 2026).  
   – Synthesises five years of Google-Trends history and lists typical triggers and decay profiles.  
   – Mainly descriptive; uses verifiable dates (e.g. 24 Apr genocide commemoration) and cites open-source material.  Good for pattern recognition but does not supply raw numbers.  
3. Seven press-articles (Caliber.az, Jam-news, RAND, Times of India, Al Jazeera, Guardian).  
   – All published Jan–17 Feb 2026.  They describe peace-process milestones, U.S.–Armenia nuclear deal, visa policy, etc.  
   – They show that, at the forecast opening date, no major Armenia-related event is firmly scheduled for 17-28 Feb 2026.  
   – Helpful for gauging the chance of an exogenous news shock, but not used in the pure outside view, which deliberately abstracts from immediate headlines.

b)  Reference-class analysis  
Potential reference classes:  
i.  All 11-day changes in the “armenia” index during the last 90 days (N≈79 windows).  
ii. All 11-day changes during the last five years (N≈1 650 windows; data not fully extracted).  
iii. 11-day changes that start from a high percentile day (e.g. ≥85 on the 0–100 scale).  
iv. 11-day changes for other small-country names (“georgia”, “azerbaijan”, “moldova”) to check if the series behaves similarly.

Suitability:  
• Class i is freshest and measured with exactly the same scaling lock that will be used for resolution, minimising rescaling artefacts.  
• Classes ii–iv would be broader but introduce noise from earlier rescalings and different geopolitical cycles.  
Therefore I adopt class i (90-day history) as the principal outside-view reference.

Empirical frequencies from class i:  
– Increase > 3 points … 42 %  
– |Change| ≤ 3 points … 28 %  
– Decrease > 3 points … 30 %

c)  Time-frame analysis  
Forecast window: 17 Feb 2026 → 28 Feb 2026 (11 days).  
Within the last 90 days there were no fixed commemorative dates or wars in mid-February; index movements during quiet stretches mostly stayed within ±15 points and often within ±3.  
The 42/28/30 split therefore already reflects a mix of calm periods and two brief news flurries (10 Feb value = 100 after JD Vance visit).

d)  Justification for the outside view probabilities  
1. Base-rate anchoring: begin with 42/28/30 derived above.  
2. Shrinkage toward equal odds: sample of 79 windows is modest, so apply mild Bayesian shrink toward a flat prior (33/33/34).  Using a Beta(1,1) prior and the observed tallies produces posterior means of ≈40/29/31.  
3. No conditioning on the exceptionally high starting value or on specific upcoming events—that would belong to the inside view.

Outside view calibration:

• I report rounded whole-percentage probabilities:  
   Increases … 40 %  
   Doesn’t change … 29 %  
   Decreases … 31 %  

• The distribution sums to 100 % and stays close to the empirical ratios while modestly tempering them toward 1/3-each to account for sampling error and the historical possibility of unanticipated shocks (roughly a 1-in-3 “upset” frequency for either direction in the raw data).

Outside View Prediction:
Option_A (Increases): 40  
Option_B (Doesn't change): 29  
Option_C (Decreases): 31
