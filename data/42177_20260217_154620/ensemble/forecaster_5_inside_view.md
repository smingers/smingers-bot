Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological, Feb 5-17 2026; all dates 2026)
1. Lavrov interview (Izvestia, 5 Feb). Factual quotes from Russian FM; reliable mainstream Russian outlet. Mainly opinion on Moscow–Yerevan ties.
2. Visa-waiver stories (Time Out, Travel and Tour World, 16 Feb). Tourism magazines citing Tourism Committee chair; factual policy change, light editorial tone. Good for gauging potential U S tourist interest.
3. JD Vance visit coverage (Day.az 17 Feb, Tribune 16 Feb). News/analysis quoting U S vice-president and think-tankers; Azerbaijani outlet Day.az is partisan but quotes verifiable events; Tribune is mainstream Indian daily. Dates fall one day before forecasting window.
4. OC-Media & Caucasus Watch (20 Jan, 17 Feb). Regional analytical sites, reasonably reliable; give geopolitical background, not event-dated inside our window.
5. Google Trends current value 95 on 16 Feb (machine data). High-quality, directly tied to resolution metric.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence
• Statistical ceiling: starting value 95 leaves at most 5 points to 100; Increase requires ≥99 (change > 3). Historical Trend-spike file (2021-25) shows windows that start at ≥90 fall >3 points 64 % of the time within 11 days and rise >3 only 13 %.
Moderate evidence
• Fresh tourism-visa news (16 Feb) may sustain general-interest searches from U S audience over several days.
• Ongoing media echo of JD Vance trip and peace-process commentary could keep news pages repeating “Armenia”.
Weak evidence
• Possible unscheduled flare-ups (border, protests) – no indication now.
• Seasonality: late-February has no fixed Armenian commemorations in U S news flow.

(c) Time-frame analysis
Horizon = 11 days. If the window were halved (to 5-6 days) I would shift 5 pp from Decrease toward Doesn’t change because regression has less time. If doubled (≈3 weeks) I would shift another 5-7 pp from Doesn’t change to Decrease as mean-reversion chances grow.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift
Outside view 40 / 30 / 30 (Inc / No chg / Dec).
Adjustments:
+ Ceiling & regression effect (strong) Inc -20 pp, No chg +5 pp, Dec +15 pp
+ Tourism + continuing media buzz (moderate) Inc +2 pp, No chg +3 pp, Dec -5 pp
+ Residual noise / sampling error (weak) Inc +0 pp, No chg +0 pp, Dec +0 pp
Rounded final: Inc 22 %, No chg 28 %, Dec 50 %.

Probability calibration
I am 78 % confident that the value on 28 Feb will be ≤92, reflecting both historical regression and broad downward head-room, but leave room (22 %) for sustained or renewed publicity to push the index to ≥99.

Checklist
1. Options: compare US Google-Trends value for “armenia” on 17 Feb vs 28 Feb; ±3 band = “Doesn’t change”.
2. Outside view: 40 / 30 / 30.
3. Consistency: Most likely = Decrease; least likely = Increase – yes, matches reasoning and ceiling.
4. Key evidence (20 words each)
   – Start figure 95 very near 30-day peak.
   – Historical ≥90 windows fall >3 points 64 %.
   – Maximum headroom for increase only 5 points.
   – Visa-waiver & Vance trip keep Armenia in U S news mid-February.
5. Blind-spot: Major breaking story (earthquake, celebrity visit) boosting U S searches past 99 near 28 Feb.
6. Status-quo: smooth fade in interest typical after spikes → favours Decrease.
7. Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [22, 28, 50]
