Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. GoogleTrendsData extract (17 Feb 2026). Factual, machine–generated daily index values for “armenia” in the United States. High-quality for the purpose of a statistical base rate; no opinions.  
2. Agent_report on historical trend spikes (compiled Feb 2026). Synthesises five-year Google Trends downloads and links each spike to clearly identified news events. Credible and directly relevant; the author discloses methodological limits (rescaling, lack of raw exports). Contains both description (factual) and judgement (e.g., what “usually” happens); the factual chronology is the component used here.  
3-7. Web‐articles dated Jan-Feb 2026 (Caliber.az, Jam-News, RAND, Al-Jazeera, Guardian, Times of India). They provide current-affairs context that could, in principle, generate future search spikes. All are dated within five weeks and come from recognisable outlets. For an outside-view estimate we note only that none announces a scheduled, headline-grabbing event inside 17–28 Feb 2026. Opinions (e.g., “historic”, “coward”) are ignored for base-rate construction.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes considered:  
• Unconditional 11-day windows over the last 90 Google-Trends days (n≈80).  
• “Quiet” windows that begin ≥14 days after any spike ≥80 (Agent_report: 17 such windows since 2021).  
• February windows in the past five years.  

The forecasting question does not stipulate any special condition (e.g., “absent a war”). The safest, information-light outside view is therefore the unconditional 11-day window, because it averages over both calm and noisy periods while matching the resolution horizon exactly.  This class is also the only one for which we have numeric frequencies calculated (GoogleTrendsData).

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Resolution window = 11 days (17 Feb–28 Feb 2026).  In the 90-day sample the distribution of outcomes for a change larger than ±3 points over 11 days is:  
• Increase: 42 %  
• Decrease: 30 %  
• Within ±3 (“Doesn’t change”): 28 %

(d) Justification  
• Google Trends for a small country name is moderately volatile even in non-crisis periods (std dev ≈10 on a 0-100 scale). A ±3 band is narrow relative to this noise; hence absolute stability is uncommon (observed only 28 % of the time).  
• The last recorded value (90) is near the 90-day maximum (100), implying regression-to-the-mean pressure, but on an outside-view basis we do not assume mean-reversion; we defer that to an inside-view adjustment.  
• No regularly recurring commemorative spike (e.g., 24 April) falls inside the window, but the unconditional class already mixes in windows that likewise lacked such events.  
• Domain-wide “upset” rate is therefore equal to 72 % (any movement >3 points), suggesting that change is the base expectation.

Outside view calibration:

I adopt the empirical frequencies from the unconditional reference class as the starting probabilities and widen them by ±2 percentage points to reflect sampling error (n≈80) and the possibility that the last 90 days slightly over-represent volatility compared with longer history.

Adjusted outside-view probabilities:  
• Increases: 40 % (down 2 pts from 42 %)  
• Doesn’t change: 30 % (up 2 pts from 28 %)  
• Decreases: 30 % (same order of magnitude as observed 30 %)

Outside View Prediction:
['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']  
Increases: 40%  
Doesn't change: 30%  
Decreases: 30%
