Analysis:
The Google Trends value for “armenia” will spike only if something about Armenia breaks into mainstream U.S. awareness during the next eleven days. Search interest is most often driven by:
• Renewed Armenia-Azerbaijan fighting or a major peace deal.  
• High-profile diplomatic moves (e.g., EU/US-brokered talks, sanctions, recognition issues).  
• Domestic political turmoil in Yerevan (protests, snap elections, resignations).  
• Disasters, large diaspora demonstrations, or cultural moments happening soon.  

To gauge whether any such catalyst is brewing, I need the very latest reporting and any scheduled events through late February. My queries therefore focus on (a) fresh Armenia-Azerbaijan security news, (b) broader Armenian political/economic stories in U.S. outlets, and (c) forward-looking calendars of expected Armenia-related events.
