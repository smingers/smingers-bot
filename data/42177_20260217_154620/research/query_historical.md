Analysis:
We must decide whether U.S. Google-search interest in “armenia” will be higher, lower, or roughly unchanged on 2026-02-28 versus 2026-02-17.  Interest is already very high (95/100) on 2026-02-16, implying a recent spike—likely tied to breaking news (e.g., renewed Armenia-Azerbaijan tensions, political upheaval, or a major diaspora story).  Key contextual facts to gather:

1. Catalysts:  Is there active or scheduled diplomacy, conflict escalation, elections, or other Armenia-related events expected between Feb 17-28 2026 that could further boost or sustain U.S. attention?
2. Historical decay:  When “armenia” spiked in the past (e.g., Sept 2023 exodus from Nagorno-Karabakh, Nov 2020 war), how quickly did interest fall back?  Typical post-peak drop rates help judge whether a value of 95 is more likely to retreat by >3 points within eleven days.
3. Baseline volatility:  The standard deviation of daily values over the last 90 days will show how often moves of >3 points occur absent new catalysts.
