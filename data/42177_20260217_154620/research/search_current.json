2026\"\n\n**Source:** OC Media  \n**Date:** January 20, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Assessments:\n\n**Military Conflict Assessment:**\n- Armenia's Foreign Intelligence Service annual report states that war with Azerbaijan in 2026 is \"highly unlikely\"\n- This assessment follows the Washington Summit in August 2025, where Armenia and Azerbaijan initialed (but have not yet signed) a peace deal under US mediation\n\n**Expected Progress:**\n- The report assesses it is \"highly likely\" that progress will be achieved in:\n  - Border delimitation process between the two countries\n  - Bilateral trade\n  - Economic initiatives\n  - Dialogue\n  - Unblocking regional transit links\n\n**Risk Factors Identified:**\n- \"States with the goal of maintaining and expanding their influence in the region\" pose \"risks of malign activities\" against peace progress (likely referring to Russia, according to the article)\n- Azerbaijan's state-promoted narratives referring to parts of Armenia as \"western Azerbaijan\" pose long-term risks to peace-building\n- Azerbaijan has \"increased this propaganda since the Washington Declaration\" rather than reducing it\n- Azerbaijan's military expenditure has increased, with growth rates \"substantially exceeding\" spending on other sectors\n\n**CSTO Relations:**\n- Armenia will \"almost certainly not\" unfreeze its membership in the Russia-led Collective Security Treaty Organisation (CSTO) in 2026\n- Armenia \"froze\" its CSTO membership in early 2024 due to the organization's failure to defend Armenia against Azerbaijani border attacks\n\n**Hybrid Threats:**\n- Hybrid threats against Armenia in 2026 will \"highly likely become more comprehensive, complex, and large-scale\" ahead of 2026 parliamentary elections\n- Hybrid warfare will \"highly likely\" be employed to influence implementation of the Trump Route (TRIPP)\n- The Trump Route, agreed at the Washington Summit, would establish transit links between Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan through Armenian territory\n- While not explicitly named in the report, Armenian officials have repeatedly accused Russia of employing disinformation campaigns and interference in Armenia's domestic affairs\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://caucasuswatch.de/en/insights/us-armenian-relations-amid-shifting-power-dynamics-expectations-and-challenges.html\">\n# Summary of Article: \"U.S.\u2013Armenian Relations Amid Shifting Power Dynamics: Expectations and Challenges\"\n\n**Source:** Caucasus Watch  \n**Date:** February 17, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Context:\n\n**Regional Dynamics:**\n- The South Caucasus is undergoing political and geopolitical transformation with shifting power balances and contested connectivity projects\n- U.S.-Armenian relations are at a critical stage, historically based on democratic cooperation, humanitarian assistance, and diaspora engagement\n- Armenia faces heightened security vulnerabilities and is searching for reliable external partners\n\n**TRIPP Project:**\n- A major infrastructure proposal involving the U.S. and Armenia\n- Armenian authorities aim to finalize details in early 2026, with construction expected to begin in the second half of 2026\n- Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan stated the project includes railways, roads, and pipelines\n- Many in Yerevan view U.S. participation as a potential counterweight to regional pressures and signal of deeper geopolitical commitment\n\n**Expert Analysis (Dr. Benyamin Poghosyan, Senior Research Fellow at Applied Policy Research Institute of Armenia):**\n\n*On U.S. Policy Approach:*\n- Current U.S. administration shows tendency to shift attention quickly between issues, lacking clear strategic approach and long-term planning\n- Decisions made rapidly through small circles close to the president via \"WhatsApp\" or \"Signal\" diplomacy\n- Creates unpredictability in U.S. long-term foreign policy, including South Caucasus engagement\n- Russia has longstanding presence in the region, while U.S. cannot guarantee sustained attention\n\n*On Azerbaijan and Security:*\n- Early 2025: Azerbaijan signaled plans to forcibly open the Syunik corridor\n- U.S. proposed easing Azerbaijan's transit to Nakhchivan and Turkey while preventing Syunik's occupation\n- U.S. involvement makes large-scale Azerbaijani action unlikely currently\n- Concern that if U.S. attention decreases, the deterrent factor against Azerbaijan could be quickly neutralized\n\n*On Iran Relations:*\n- Between 2021-2024, Iran helped prevent Azerbaijan from forcibly opening the Zangezur corridor, warning of potential military force\n- Iran's influence has weakened since 2023 due to internal unrest and escalating tensions with Israel and U.S.\n- Iran is displeased with prospect of U.S. presence along Armenia-Iran border\n- Iran's newly appointed ambassador to Armenia suggested impression forming of Armenia becoming hub for anti-Iranian activities\n- Iran views its borders as increasingly insecure\n\n*On Armenia's Response to U.S.-Iran Tensions:*\n- Armenia would likely respond with statements only, not direct criticism of U.S.\n- Example: During July 2025 strikes against Iran, Armenia emphasized international law and peaceful dispute resolution (statement made on first day of conflict, not after U.S. strikes)\n- Poghosyan expects future military operations would likely involve Israeli strikes, possibly with U.S. involvement, rather than direct U.S. attacks\n\n*On TRIPP Participation:*\n- No third-party involvement anticipated; project requires only Armenia and U.S. consent\n- Armenian officials indicate Turkey and Russia's participation not currently considered\n- Iran's participation would be \"entirely unacceptable to the United States\"\n- While Turkey's involvement might be acceptable (NATO member) and Russia's could be considered within broader U.S.-Russia agreements, Iran's would not be\n\n**Note:** The article

gamble against Azerbaijan: Paris's geopolitical miscalculation\"\n\n**Source:** News.az (Opinion piece by Zaur Nurmamedov, journalist and graduate of the Faculty of Political Science at the Academy of Public Administration under the President of Azerbaijan)\n\n## Key Facts and Context:\n\n**Armenian Diaspora in France:**\n- France has the second largest Armenian diaspora in the world after the United States\n- Estimated at around 600,000 people\n- Deeply integrated into French society with active political participation\n\n**Historical Tensions:**\n- Relations between Azerbaijan and France have reached their lowest point in bilateral history\n- France provided Armenia with diplomatic, financial, and military support during the Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict\n- France served as co-chair of the OSCE Minsk Group but allegedly failed to demonstrate objectivity\n\n**Second Karabakh War (September 2020):**\n- French President Emmanuel Macron publicly claimed that more than 300 ISIS fighters were allegedly transferred to Azerbaijan via Turkey\n- These allegations were never substantiated\n- Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev described the statements as unacceptable and demanded an apology\n- After the war, Macron stated France would continue supporting Armenia and monitor its territorial integrity\n\n**Post-2020 Developments:**\n- Since 2020, France repeatedly sought to advance resolutions against Azerbaijan in the UN Security Council and European Parliament\n- In 2023, Aliyev stated that Azerbaijan's victory in the 44-day war caused irritation in France\n- French politicians opposed holding COP 29 in Baku\n\n**Strategic Context:**\n- Following the Russia-Ukraine conflict, the South Caucasus gained strategic importance\n- The Middle Corridor emerged as an important alternative to routes through Russia\n- French economy relies on supplies of uranium from Central Asia and rare earth metals\n\n**US Involvement (August 2025):**\n- Meeting in Washington between US President Donald Trump, Ilham Aliyev, and Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan\n- Joint declaration on normalization of relations\n- Launch of the TRIPP project (\"Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity\")\n- Project envisions opening a transit route between mainland Azerbaijan and Nakhchivan with Armenian-American consortium participation\n- The US effectively took the lead in shaping peace and transit architecture in the South Caucasus\n\n**Recent Developments:**\n- In a recent interview with France 24, President Aliyev stressed Azerbaijan was not the source of tensions\n- Aliyev noted France had supported separatists by adopting more than 10 resolutions targeting Azerbaijan\n- France recognized \"Nagorno-Karabakh,\" which Armenia itself had not done\n- Aliyev mentioned his meeting with Macron at the end of 2025 was positive, with both sides agreeing to \"press the reset button\"\n- Baku is ready for normalization based on respect for sovereignty and non-interference\n\n**Author's Assessment:**\nThe article argues that France's strategy was strategically flawed, resulting in losses for France itself. By confronting Azerbaijan, France failed to alter the conflict outcome, did not secure control over regional communications, and ceded diplomatic initiative to the United States.\n\n**Note:** This is an opinion piece from an Azerbaijani journalist with stated views that do not necessarily reflect the position of News.az. The article presents a perspective favorable to Azerbaijan's position in the conflict.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cfr.org/articles/ten-elections-watch-2026\">\n# Summary of CFR Article: \"Ten Elections to Watch in 2026\"\n\n**Publication Date:** December 9, 2025  \n**Author:** James M.

Raf highlighted that Azerbaijan's role on the global stage is rapidly increasing, with the country being a focal point of heightened U.S. interest. He emphasized the strong personal relationship between Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev and former U.S. President Donald Trump, noting that the U.S.-brokered agreement between Azerbaijan and Armenia marked a significant turning point. Azerbaijan, described as an energy power with close ties to Israel and Turkey, holds strategic geopolitical significance due to its proximity to both Russia and Iran. Its role as a transit corridor connecting East and West is frequently discussed in Washington, more so than in any period in recent decades. Raf also pointed out that the war in Ukraine has opened new opportunities for the U.S. in the South Caucasus, and Western efforts to reduce dependence on Russian natural gas have made partners like Azerbaijan even more vital. He concluded that the post-2020 Second Nagorno-Karabakh War initiated a new diplomatic process in the region, and the U.S. aims to energize this process, which explains Vance\u2019s visit. On February 10, 2026, Vance arrived in the Republic of Azerbaijan for an official visit, during which the U.S. and Azerbaijan signed a Charter of Strategic Partnership. President Aliyev and Vice President Vance then jointly addressed the press.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 12:45 PM\nSource:[\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Day.Az](https://news.day.az/politics/1815613.html)\n\n**Modern World Built on Pragmatism, Not Stone Age Myths \u2013 Tatyana Poloskova for Day.Az**\nTatyana Poloskova, a Russian State Counselor of the First Class and director of the 'Eastern Vector' consulting center, argues that the modern world is built on pragmatism, not myths about the Stone Age. She criticizes the Armenian opposition's efforts to win the June 7, 2026 parliamentary elections, stating their tactics are outdated and resemble a political carnival. She highlights that the opposition lacks real support, especially from serious Armenian business, which is now focusing on the profitable Zangazur project. The visit of U.S. Vice President JD Vance to Baku and Yerevan further underscored the failure of Armenian lobbying in the U.S., with the U.S.-Azerbaijan Strategic Partnership Charter signed on February 10, 2026, marking a new era in bilateral relations. Poloskova dismisses the opposition's plans, including the candidacy of Samvel Karapetyan\u2014currently under investigation and ineligible due to dual citizenship\u2014and the proposed constitutional changes to enable him to become prime minister. She notes that even Russian-backed groups recognize the futility of these efforts. According to her, the Russian establishment no longer supports Armenian separatist ambitions, and the era of anti-Russian narratives is over. The realpolitik of regional stability and mutual benefit has replaced mythologized historical claims. She concludes that post-election, the issue of separatism will be decisively closed in Armenia, as the country is already impoverished by the 'revengeful clique' and no longer needs conflict-driven politics.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 06:50 AM\nSource:[\u0418\u043d\u0444\u043e\u0440\u043c\u0430\u0446\u0438\u043e\u043d\u043d\u044b\u0439 \u043f\u043e\u0440\u0442\u0430\u043b Day.Az](https://news.day.az/politics/1816518.html)\n\n**A TRIPP across the South Caucasus - The Tribune**\nTwo high-level visits to Armenia in February 2026\u2014by India's Chief of Defence Staff (CDS) General Anil Chauhan and U.S. Vice President JD Vance\u2014highlight a growing strategic competition in the South Caucasus region, comprising Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia. General Chauhan's visit marked the first by India's senior-most military official, signaling strengthened bilateral defence ties. The two nations agreed to expand military training cooperation, building on India\u2019s $2.2 billion defence supply portfolio to Armenia since 2022, including Akash air-defence systems and Pinaka rocket launchers. Chauhan also paid respects at the Armenian Genocide Memorial, underscoring historical sensitivities. Vance\u2019s visit, the highest-level U.S. engagement since Armenia\u2019s 1991 independence, focused on advancing the 'Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity' (TRIPP), a proposed 43-km transit corridor through Armenian territory linking Azerbaijan\u2019s Nakhchivan enclave to Turkey and potentially Europe. Though the TRIPP is not formally mentioned in the August 2025 peace deal between Armenia and Azerbaijan, it is embedded in transit provisions and requires ratification. The U.S. has offered to manage the corridor, proposing a 100-year lease. Iran views TRIPP as a strategic threat, especially due to potential U.S. and Israeli presence on its northern border, and has sought a trilateral arrangement with India and Armenia\u2014currently stalled. India has signaled strategic assertiveness, warning Turkey and Azerbaijan against meddling in its regional affairs, including support for Pakistan and Bangladesh. The visits reflect broader shifts: Armenia\u2019s distancing from Russia and the CSTO, and the region\u2019s transformation into a contested arena involving Russia, Iran, Turkey, India, Israel, and the U.S.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 08:56 PM\nSource:[The Tribune](https://www.tribuneindia.com/news/comment/a-tripp-across-the-south-caucasus/)\n\n**Azerbaijan throws light on export costs to Armenia in January 2026**\nIn January 2026, Azerbaijan exported $2.4 million worth of goods to Armenia, according to the State Customs Committee as reported by Trend News Agency. This follows President Ilham Aliyev's announcement on October 21, 2025, that Azerbaijan had lifted all cargo transit restrictions to Armenia, which had been in place since the time of occupation. The first transit shipment under the new policy was a consignment of Kazakh grain to Armenia. On December 18, 2025, SOCAR sent 1,220 tons of RON95 motor fuel to Armenia. On January 9, 2026, a total of 2,698 tons of cargo\u2014comprising 1,742 tons of RON95 gasoline and 956 tons of diesel fuel\u2014was transported via 48 railcars.

This policy aims to boost tourism and encourage spontaneous travel to the country. According to Lusine Gevorgyan, chairman of the Tourism Committee of Armenia, the move is 'a clear invitation to travellers around the world' and reflects Armenia's openness and welcoming nature. The country, which won the Destination of the Year for Adventure Tourism Award in early 2025, offers diverse attractions including the Zangezur and Gegham Mountains for hiking, paragliding, and rock climbing. It also features several UNESCO World Heritage Sites such as the Haghpat and Sanahin monasteries (10th\u201313th centuries), Echmiadzin Cathedral (founded in 303 AD), Zvartnots Temples, Geghard Monastery, and the Upper Azat Valley. Yerevan, the capital, combines Soviet-era architecture with modern cafes, wine bars, and museums.

In 2023, Armenia released Yuri Trostiansky, detained at Moscow\u2019s request, suspected of desertion.

He warned of structural incompatibility between European Union integration and continued participation in the Eurasian Economic Union (EEU), which is dominated by Moscow. Despite Prime Minister Nikol Pachinian's assurance that Armenia's policies do not aim to harm Russian interests, Galouzine claimed Erevan is accelerating its military, political, and economic alignment with Western countries and alliances. He emphasized that Moscow has repeatedly informed Armenian partners that the West views Armenia as a tool in its strategic competition with Russia. Galouzine also stressed that economic benefits\u2014such as strong economic growth, low inflation, currency stability, and access to a large market for Armenian goods\u2014depend on cooperation with Russia and the EEU. He reaffirmed Russia\u2019s view of Armenia as a 'natural ally' in the South Caucasus, citing a solid legal framework and asserting that 'there is no alternative' to Russo-Armenian cooperation, which is essential for regional stability and future prosperity. In response, Pachinian stated Armenia seeks to align with EU standards while maintaining its current EEU membership 'as long as possible,' adding that if coexistence becomes impossible, a decision will be made in accordance with 'the free expression of the people's will.'\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 07:34 AM\nSource:[Nouvelles d'Arm\u00e9nie](https://www.armenews.com/m-galuzin-larmenie-ne-pourra-pas-se-conformer-aux-reglementations-de-luee-si-elle-passe-a-la-reglementation-de-lue/)\n\n**UAE Joins Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Oman in Pioneering Armenia's 2026 Visa Exemption, Making Travel Effortless for Tourists and Expanding Business Horizons - Travel And Tour World**\nArmenia has introduced a temporary visa exemption policy effective from January 1 to July 1, 2026, allowing residents of 113 countries to enter without a visa. The initiative is led by the UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Oman, who are driving the effort to simplify travel and expand business opportunities. The policy aims to boost tourism and strengthen regional collaboration by making Armenia more accessible to international visitors. The country\u2019s rich history, UNESCO World Heritage sites, natural landscapes, and vibrant culture\u2014centered in Yerevan\u2014are highlighted as key attractions. This strategic move supports Armenia\u2019s broader vision to enhance its global tourism profile, promote sustainable tourism, and leverage its cultural and natural assets.

This statement followed comments by Russian Deputy Prime Minister Alexei Overchuk, who questioned whether Armenia was prepared to join what he described as a military-political bloc hostile to Russia, in the context of Armenia\u2019s growing engagement with the European Union. Pashinyan rejected the idea that Armenia\u2019s EU outreach was directed against Moscow, asserting, 'No one will be able to involve us in the logic of acting against Russia.' He affirmed that Armenia values its relationship with Russia, citing strong personal ties with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin, and stated that Armenia would not enter into a war of words or confrontation with Moscow. However, he emphasized that Armenia would always act in its own national interests, declaring, 'We will never act against Russia, but we will always act in the interests of the Republic of Armenia,' calling this approach 'logical' for any sovereign state. Pashinyan also noted that concerns raised by Russian officials during a meeting in August had been resolved through open dialogue, underscoring Armenia\u2019s commitment to transparent communication with Moscow as it recalibrates its foreign policy.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 15, 2026 05:51 PM\nSource:[bne IntelliNews](https://www.intellinews.com/pm-says-armenia-will-not-act-against-russia-but-will-put-its-own-interests-first-426069/)\n\n**U.S. Vice President Vance\u2019s Visit to Yerevan and Baku: Washington Pushes to Replace Russian Influence in the South Caucasus**\nU.S. Vice President J.D. Vance is on a diplomatic tour of Armenia and Azerbaijan from February 9 to 12, 2024, marking the first visit of a U.S. official of his rank to Baku since 2008 and the first to Yerevan ever. The visit centers on the U.S.-backed TRIPP project\u2014'Trump\u2019s Road to Peace and Prosperity'\u2014which aims to establish the Zangezur Corridor, a transport route linking Azerbaijan\u2019s mainland to Nakhchivan and Turkey through Armenian territory. This corridor is strategically significant for Baku, which previously threatened to seize it by force. The U.S. seeks to position itself as the central architect of the corridor, with Azerbaijan serving as a user, while also advancing broader regional logistics goals: enabling Central Asian cargo to reach Europe via a shorter route than the current one through Georgia, which extends transit time from 12 to 18 days. The U.S. stands to gain substantial economic benefits from this initiative. Russia, which currently holds influence through its control of Armenia\u2019s South Caucasus Railway (a subsidiary of Russian Railways) under a concession set to expire in 2036, faces diminishing leverage. Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin warned that Armenia\u2019s membership in the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU) makes cooperation with Russia necessary, but this is seen as a weak counterweight, as Armenia has repeatedly signaled interest in aligning with the EU instead. Western narratives previously framed the Armenia-Azerbaijan rapprochement as a united front against Putin, suggesting the two former adversaries are overcoming their conflict to exclude Russia from the South Caucasus\u2014a trend that appears to be progressing.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 05:23 AM\nSource:[\u0411\u043b\u043e\u043a\u043d\u043e\u0442 \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f](https://bloknot.ru/v-mire/amerikanskij-barin-vens-edet-v-erevan-i-baku-vashington-dobivaet-ostatki-vliyaniya-moskvy-v-zakavkaze-1494584.html)\n\n**Three Weeks Left: From March 1, 2026, All Rules Change for Migrants in Russia**\nAccording to Konstantin Malofeev, founder of Tsargrad, starting March 1, 2026, employers in Russia will be legally allowed to terminate foreign workers if their industry has been closed to migrants in a given region. This change eliminates a previous legal loophole, making restrictions enforceable. Malofeev emphasizes that the labor market for foreign workers has reached its peak, with 2.3 million migrants working under patents in 2025\u20149% more than in 2024. He argues that this growth is unnecessary, as Russia\u2019s native workforce\u2014children born in the mid-2000s\u2014is now entering the labor market and must be prioritized. He predicts that 2026 will continue the trend of expanding restrictions on foreign labor, possibly leading to full exclusion in certain sectors. Malofeev also calls for reevaluating Russia\u2019s relationship with the Eurasian Economic Union (EAEU), particularly with Armenia, which he describes as a 'brotherly people' but a 'Russophobic government.' He notes that nearly $4 billion flowed from Russia to Armenia in 2024, despite Armenia\u2019s small GDP of under $26 billion, and criticizes Russia\u2019s reluctance to impose restrictions on a country he labels an 'open enemy,' especially given the extensive sanctions imposed on Russia.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 09, 2026 06:18 AM\nSource:[\u0422\u0435\u043b\u0435\u043a\u0430\u043d\u0430\u043b \u0426\u0430\u0440\u044c\u0433\u0440\u0430\u0434](https://tsargrad.tv/news/ostalos-tri-nedeli-s-1-marta-dlja-migrantov-menjaetsja-vsjo_1550771)\n\n**Lavrov Highlights Russia\u2019s Interest in Strengthening Relations with Armenia**\nOn February 5, 2026, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov stated during a meeting with Armenia's National Assembly representative Alan Simonyan that Russia is interested in strengthening relations with Armenia.

Lavrov described Armenia as a 'partner and strategic ally' of Russia and acknowledged the complex situation on the South Caucasus. He expressed confusion over periodic claims of alleged imminent northern attacks on Armenia, which he dismissed as mythical. Lavrov reaffirmed Moscow\u2019s role as Armenia\u2019s primary trading partner and expressed readiness to expand cooperation.

He highlighted the expansion of cooperation with the United States, including joint ventures under the TRIPP company in managing international and regional rail, road freight, passenger transport, transit, and energy infrastructure such as gas, oil, and power pipelines. Pashinyan emphasized that recent economic developments reflect this shift: a bond issuance of 50 billion AMD attracted 165 billion AMD in market demand, causing yields to drop by over 1.5% and interest rates to fall. This surge in demand\u2014threefold increase\u2014indicates strong confidence, with foreign investors actively purchasing short-term government bonds in Armenian drams. He also noted ongoing EU cooperation, including the construction of a large modern border crossing point on Armenia\u2019s border, signaling significant regional and international engagement. The Prime Minister concluded that the international economic environment is rapidly responding to political and regional changes in Armenia.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 14, 2026 02:47 PM\nSource:[NEWS.am](http://news.am/rus/news/925171.html)\n\n**Armenian PM points to new horizons for enhancing S.

Guseynov noted that Azerbaijani society holds diverse views on the reconciliation process, ranging from negative to positive, with strong memories of the conflict still influencing perceptions. He emphasized that building trust between the sides requires time and highlighted the visit as a step toward mutual recognition. He observed growing attention to civil society dialogue and predicted a similar public reaction in Azerbaijan when the Armenian delegation visits. Guseynov explained that the isolation of Armenian and Azerbaijani societies for three to four decades contributes to the complexity of reconciliation.
