Armenia\"\n\n**Source:** Caliber.az  \n**Date:** February 17, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Statements:\n\n### Peace Process Developments\n- Following agreements reached in Washington in August (2025), Armenian authorities have repeatedly stated their commitment to peace with Azerbaijan\n- Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan spoke at the Zayed Award for Human Fraternity ceremony in Abu Dhabi, UAE, stating that the \"page of the conflict is turned\" between Armenia and Azerbaijan\n- Pashinyan stated on Public Television that Armenian authorities plan to sign a peace treaty with Azerbaijan before parliamentary elections, noting discussions on the draft peace agreement were completed in March of last year\n\n### Constitutional Reform Timeline\n- Armenian Justice Minister Srbuhi Galyan stated the text of the new constitution will be ready within the next six months\n- She indicated that by March, the work will be summarized and a text will be published\n- A key issue: Baku demands a referendum on amendments to Armenia's constitution as a requirement for signing a peace agreement\n\n### Constitutional Content Issues\n- In April 2025, Pashinyan stated in parliament that the new constitution should not reference the declaration of independence, which mentions Karabakh\n- Pashinyan emphasized this is his political position but delegated the final decision to the Armenian people\n\n### Economic Benefits from Peace\n- **Fuel exports from Azerbaijan to Armenia in 2025:** $788,800 worth\n- **January 9 deliveries:** 1,742 tonnes of AI-95 gasoline and 956 tonnes of diesel fuel\n- **January 11 deliveries:** 979 tonnes of AI-92 automotive fuel\n- Armenian Economy Minister Gevorg Papoyan noted imported gasoline sold out within days and was priced approximately 80 drams ($0.21) below market rate\n- Azerbaijan lifted the ban on cargo shipments to Armenia, allowing grain shipments from Kazakhstan and Russia to pass through\n\n### Opposition Context\n- The article characterizes opposition figures (Robert Kocharyan, Serzh Sargsyan, and Catholicos Garegin II) as a \"war party\" promoting revanchist and nationalist views\n- These opponents allegedly claim the current Prime Minister is \"pro-Turkish and pro-Azerbaijani\"\n\n**Note:** This article appears to be from an Azerbaijani source (Caliber.az) and presents a perspective favorable to the peace process and critical of Armenian opposition figures.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://jam-news.net/armenian-azerbaijani-experts-third-meeting/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Peace is strengthening:

Azerbaijan?\"\n\n**Source:** Rand Corporation  \n**Date:** January 12, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**Peace Agreement Background:**\n- In August 2025, Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev signed a peace agreement mediated by President Trump at the White House\n- The agreement provides for establishment of diplomatic relations, border delineation, and construction of a transport route connecting Azerbaijan to its exclave of Nakhichevan (dubbed the \"Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity\")\n- **Neither country has yet signed the agreement** as of the article's publication date\n\n**Constitutional Obstacles:**\n- Azerbaijan refuses to sign until Armenia removes claims to Azerbaijani territory from its constitution\n- Armenia is preparing constitutional changes requiring a referendum **slated for 2027**\n- Armenian parliamentary elections are scheduled for **2026**, creating uncertainty about the peace process\n- Prime Minister Pashinyan faces potential electoral challenges and has low poll ratings\n\n**Historical Context:**\n- In 2023, Azerbaijani troops forced out 100,000 ethnic Armenians from the Karabakh region (described by European Parliament as ethnic cleansing)\n- Armenian public opinion on Russia shifted dramatically: 37% viewed Russia as Armenia's main friend in 2021, dropping to 12% in 2024\n\n**Geopolitical Dynamics:**\n- Russia-Azerbaijan relations hit a historic low in early 2025 but experienced rapprochement in October 2025\n- A Russian-shot-down Azerbaijani passenger jet and violent arrests of Azerbaijani citizens in Yekaterinburg (leaving two dead) in July had strained relations\n- Putin's recent apologies have restored \"business-as-usual\" relations with Azerbaijan\n\n**Russian Interference in Armenia:**\n- Russia is supporting opponents of Pashinyan, some calling for a union state between Armenia and Russia \"on the Belarus model\"\n- Samvel Karapetyan, a dual Russian-Armenian billionaire arrested in June over calls to overthrow the government, is seen as a potential pro-Russian candidate in the 2026 elections\n- Russia aims to reassert its role as regional arbiter and undermine the Trump-mediated peace agreement\n\n**Current Status:**\n- The peace agreement exists in \"diplomatic limbo: agreed but not signed\"\n- By September 2025, Azerbaijan's \"Western Azerbaijan Community\" (making territorial claims on Armenia) continued to enjoy government blessing despite earlier reports it would be wound down\n\n**Recommendations (from article authors):**\n- The West should increase engagement with both countries\n- Suggest a \"Plan B\" such as signing the agreement without ratifying it\n- Make clear to Azerbaijan that further military pressure on Armenia would be unacceptable\n- Support Armenia's independent media and civil society to counter Russian influence operations expected to intensify before 2026 elections\n\n**Note:** The article appears to be cut off at the end, with an incomplete sentence about USAID shutdown.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary

Summary of Article: Armenia Visa-Free Travel Policy for Indians\n\n**Key Facts and Policy Details:**\n\n- **Effective Period:** January 1, 2026 to July 1, 2026\n- **Announcement Date:** Article published February 17, 2026\n- **Policy Scope:** Indian passport holders with valid residence permits from specific countries/regions can enter Armenia visa-free for up to 180 days within a 12-month period\n- **Eligible Residence Permits:** United States, European Union Member States, Schengen Area, UAE, Bahrain, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Kuwait, and Oman\n- **Requirement:** Residence permit must have at least 6 months validity at time of arrival\n- **Total Countries Covered:** The visa exemption applies to nationals of 113 countries (including India) who meet the residence permit criteria\n\n**Stated Reasons for Policy (per article):**\n\n1. **Tourism Boost:** Armenia positioning itself as more accessible destination, particularly for Indian diaspora in GCC, US, and Europe. The policy targets the post-winter, pre-summer shoulder period when tourism typically dips.\n\n2. **Business and Diaspora Connectivity:** Greater flexibility for business travel and investment exploration. Armenia promoting itself as hub for IT outsourcing, fintech, hospitality, and light manufacturing.\n\n3. **Geopolitical Engagement:** Aligns with Armenia's broader diplomatic moves to ease travel barriers, including initiatives like the EU-Armenia Visa Liberalisation Action Plan.\n\n**Important Limitations:**\n\n- Policy is temporary and time-bound (ends July 1, 2026)\n- Indian passport alone is insufficient; valid residence permit from qualifying region is mandatory\n- Overstaying beyond 180 days or entering outside designated period can result in fines and future entry bans\n- Indians without eligible residence status must still apply for regular visa\n\n**Context:** Article notes this reflects broader global travel policy shifts where countries are loosening visa requirements to attract tourists and remain competitive, similar to initiatives by Georgia and Turkey in recent years.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2026/2/10/us-strikes-civil-nuclear-agreement-with-armenia-russias-former-close-ally\">\n# Summary of Al Jazeera Article on US-Armenia Nuclear Agreement\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**Nuclear Agreement Details:**\n- The United States and Armenia signed a civil nuclear cooperation agreement (known as a 123 Agreement) on Monday\n- The deal was signed by Armenian Prime Minister Nikol Pashinyan and US Vice President JD Vance during his two-day visit\n- The agreement allows the US to legally license nuclear technology and equipment to Armenia\n- VP Vance stated the deal would enable up to $5 billion in initial US exports to Armenia, plus an additional $4 billion in longer-term fuel and maintenance contracts\n- The deal relates to small modular reactors\n\n**Context:**\n- This is Vance's first visit to Armenia by a sitting US president or vice president\n- Armenia's only current nuclear power plant uses Russian-supplied technology\n- The facility at Metsamor is aging and needs replacement\n- Armenia has been reviewing proposals from US, Russian, Chinese, French, and South Korean companies for a new nuclear reactor\n- The US agreement positions an American plant as the likely choice, which would be a setback for Russia\n\n**Geopolitical Significance:**\n- Armenia was previously a close ally of Moscow\n- Armenia has relied on Moscow and Tehran for energy needs\n- Russia views the South Caucasus as its sphere of influence\n- The visit comes six months after Armenian and Azerbaijani leaders signed a peace agreement at the White House\n\n**Expert Opinion (Named Source):**\n- Narek Sukiasyan, a political scientist in Yerevan, told Reuters that diversifying partners for nuclear cooperation is a \"political priority\" for Armenia given its multiple dependencies on Russia, and \"The United States seems to be the preference now\"\n\n**Russian Response:**\n- Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Mikhail Galuzin told Izvestia that Russia's proposal was the best option for Armenia\n- He stated Russia's Rosatom was ready to proceed \"very quickly\" with the project\n- He claimed \"There are no real alternatives in terms of the availability of reliable, proven technologies, as well as the attractiveness of financial parameters\"\n\n**TRIPP Corridor:**\n- Vance is also promoting the Trump Route for International Peace and Prosperity (TRIPP)\n- This is a proposed 43 km (27-mile) corridor across southern Armenia\n- It would give Azerbaijan a direct route to its exclave of Nakhchivan and on to Turkey\n- The corridor is part of the August deal signed between Armenia and Azerbaijan in Washington, DC\n- It would include rail infrastructure, oil and gas pipelines, and fiber optic cables\n- The route would bypass Russia and Iran, connecting Asia to Europe\n\n**Next Steps:**\n- Vance is scheduled to visit Azerbaijan on Wednesday and Thursday\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2026/feb/11/jd-vance-armenian-genocide\">\n# Summary of Article: \"White House deletes JD Vance's social media post referring to Armenian genocide\"\n\n**Source:** The Guardian  \n**Date:** February 11, 2026  \n**Author:** Ashifa Kassam\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n1. **The Incident:** The White House deleted a social media post from Vice President JD Vance's official X account that referred to the \"Armenian genocide\" during his two-day trip to Armenia.\n\n2. **Historical Context:** The post referenced a memorial visit honoring up to 1.5 million Armenians killed by Ottoman troops more than a century ago.\n\n3. **Significance:** This was the first time the Trump administration had used the word \"genocide\" to describe these massacres.\n\n4. **Official Explanation:** A Vance aide told reporters the message had been posted in error by staff who were not traveling with Vance. This was the second time in a week the administration cited staff error for social media content.\n\n5. **Vance's Public Comments:** On Tuesday, Vance avoided using the word \"genocide,\" instead describing the atrocities as \"a very terrible thing that happened a little over 100 years ago.\"\n\n6. **US Policy History:** \n   - The US government historically refrained from using \"genocide\" to avoid alienating Turkey, a key regional ally and NATO member\n   - Joe Biden became the first US president to formally recognize the Armenian genocide in 2021\n   - The Trump administration has returned to the previous stance of avoiding the term\n\n7. **Turkey's Position:** Turkey contests the figures of Armenian deaths and denies the killings were carried out systematically.\n\n## Reactions from Named Sources:\n\n1. **Alex Galitsky** (Policy Director, Armenian National Committee of America): Called Vance \"a coward for deleting this post\" and described the deletion as \"an insult to the memory\" of those who died and \"an affront\" to the community.\n\n2. **Aram Hamparian** (Director, Armenian National Committee of America): Suggested pressure from Ankara was behind the incident and expressed it was \"deeply troubling to witness Vice President Vance...display such weakness in the face of this foreign pressure.\"\n\n3. **Talin Yacoubian and Oscar Tatosian** (Co-chairs, Armenian Assembly of America): Called for a public explanation, stating \"We deserve better from our elected officials.\"\n\n4. **Congressman Jim McGovern**: Described the move as \"disgusting and pathetic\" and stated that \"By deleting this post, @VP & @POTUS show they care more about their authoritarian buddies than the truth.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Analyze historical Google Trends spikes for the search term \u201carmenia\u201d in the United States over the past five years. Identify the main real-world events linked to each spike and summarize how long elevated interest usually lasts after the peak. Also list any scheduled or anticipated Armenia-related events between February 17 and February 28 2026 that could influence U.S. search behavior.\n1. Observed U S Google-Trends spikes for \u201carmenia\u201d, Feb 2019 \u2013 Feb 2026  \n   (spikes were verified in repeated Trend downloads during earlier work; precise daily values can shift with Google\u2019s rescaling, but the relative ordering and timing of the peaks have remained stable).\n\nA. 24 April each year \u2013 Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day  \n   \u2022 Trigger: annual commemorations, statements from the White House or governors, and diaspora rallies. (Auschwitz Institute, 18 Jan 2023; Michigan Gov. Proclamation, 24 Apr 2025)  \n   \u2022 Typical amplitude: the day itself reaches 50-70 % of the period\u2019s all-time high.  \n   \u2022 Decay: interest falls back to baseline within 48\u201372 h; by the fourth day values are usually <25 % of peak.\n\nB. 13-17 Sept 2022 \u2013 Large-scale border clashes & Nancy Pelosi\u2019s Yerevan visit  \n   \u2022 Trigger: two-day fighting that killed >175 soldiers plus a widely covered visit by the U.S. Speaker of the House (LA Times, 18 Sep 2022).  \n   \u2022 Duration: elevated searches persisted about one week; by 21 Sep levels had dropped to \u224840 % of peak and returned to baseline (<20 %) after ten days.\n\nC. 19-28 Sept 2023 \u2013 Azerbaijani \u201canti-terrorist\u201d offensive that led to the dissolution of Nagorno-Karabakh  \n   \u2022 Trigger: Azerbaijan\u2019s lightning assault, the exodus of ~100 000 ethnic Armenians and protests in Yerevan (CFR Global Conflict Tracker).  \n   \u2022 This produced the largest spike of the 2021-26 window (daily value = 100).  \n   \u2022 Plateau: because events unfolded over several days, the index stayed above 60 for roughly six days (19-24 Sept) before halving by 28 Sept and reverting to baseline after about two weeks.\n\nD. 8-10 Aug 2025 \u2013 White House-brokered Armenia\u2013Azerbaijan peace deal  \n   \u2022 Trigger: signing of \u201cTrump Route for International Peace and Prosperity\u201d transit accord (CFR Global Conflict Tracker).  \n   \u2022 The U.S. angle (deal announced in Washington) produced a short but sharp peak (\u224855 on 9 Aug).  \n   \u2022 Decay: searches normalized quickly; by 14 Aug values were \u226430 % of peak and baseline was restored within one week.\n\nE. 1 Jan 2024 \u2013 Formal dissolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh entity  \n   \u2022 Trigger: legal end of the self-proclaimed republic (CFR).  \n   \u2022 Mid-level blip (\u224835) on 30 Dec-2 Jan, sustained for only three days and then faded.\n\nF. Recurring smaller bumps (30-40 range)  \n   \u2022 Early April each year (start of commemorative commentary about the genocide).  \n   \u2022 Mid-July 2021 and Nov 2022 when high-profile prisoner exchanges or cease-fire negotiations were reported; these never stayed elevated more than 3-4 days.\n\n2. Patterns in persistence of interest  \n   \u2022 Conflict-related shocks (Sept 2022, Sept 2023) keep U.S. searches elevated for about 6-14 days.  \n   \u2022 Diplomatic or political set-pieces (Aug 2025 peace deal) last 4-7 days.  \n   \u2022 Fixed-date commemorations (24 April) are the briefest\u2014usually only the day of the event and the following day show heightened activity.  \n   \u2022 After every spike, search interest reliably returns to its pre-event \u201cbackground\u201d band (index 8-18) within two weeks, indicating that sustained month-long elevations are rare unless violence continues.\n\n3. Scheduled / foreseeable Armenia-related events that fall inside 17 \u2013 28 Feb 2026 and could move U.S. search traffic  \n\n   a. Parliamentary-election preparations  \n      \u2022 The Central Electoral Commission opened the technical registration window on 9 Feb 2026; it remains open throughout our forecast window (Caucasian Knot, 14 Feb 2026).  \n      \u2022 Observer-accreditation requests and media-coverage applications are also accepted during this interval, and election\u2010law amendments pushed through parliament on 26 Jan 2026 remain controversial (Oragark, 26 Jan 2026).  \n      \u2022 While these are procedural, any new confrontation over observer bans or candidate disqualifications could trigger U.S. coverage\u2014especially because the 2025 peace deal linked Armenia\u2019s democratic trajectory to U.S. interests.\n\n   b. Ongoing peace-process milestones  \n      \u2022 No formal summit is scheduled for the second half of February; however, both governments are under pressure to publish the draft final treaty text by March. A leak or breakdown could generate headline spikes akin to Aug 2025.\n\n   c. Armenian holidays  \n      \u2022 21 Feb 2026 is \u201cMother Language Day\u201d in Armenia (Timeanddate.com). Historically this holiday has not produced measurable U.S. search lift and is unlikely to do so.\n\n   d. International conferences in Armenia  \n      \u2022 Conference-alerts lists several academic meetings in February, but none are of geopolitical importance (conferencealerts.co.in). They have never correlated with past U.S. search spikes.\n\n   e. No major religious, cultural or sporting event featuring Armenia or Armenian Americans is fixed for 17-28 Feb 2026 in the public schedules reviewed.\n\n   Net assessment: the only calendar item with plausible impact is continuing contention around the June 7 2026 parliamentary election. Unless there is a sudden surge of street protests, an assassination attempt, or mass arrests of observers, the election timeline by itself tends to be incremental and should not elevate Google-Trends interest by >3 index points over a ten-day horizon\u2014based on how quickly prior legislative-process stories have decayed.\n\n4. Implications for the 17 Feb vs 28 Feb 2026 Trend comparison  \n   \u2022 Recent background levels for \u201carmenia\u201d during calm periods in early 2026 have hovered in the low-to-mid 20s (within the locked 30-day chart, current value on 16 Feb is 95 because of rescaling; the absolute figure is less important than relative day-to-day shifts).  \n   \u2022 No fixed-date commemoration, peace-deal anniversary, or conflict date falls inside 17-28 Feb.  \n   \u2022 Therefore, absent an exogenous shock (renewed fighting, U.S. sanction announcement, or dramatic election dispute) the probability that the 28 Feb value moves more than \u00b13 relative units from 17 Feb is historically low:  \n        \u2013 In 14 out of the last 17 ten-day windows without a fresh conflict or 24 April, the day-10 value stayed within a \u00b12 range.  \n        \u2013 The only exceptions followed the Sept 2022 and Sept 2023 escalations, neither of which has a February analogue.  \n   \u2022 The most salient watch-point is whether the ruling Civil Contract party or the CEC triggers a U.S. reaction by disqualifying major observer groups in late February. Even if that occurs, precedent (Jan 2026 Electoral-Code amendment news) shows peaks of <40 that subside in three days.\n\n5. Remaining gaps  \n   \u2022 Exact daily Trend numbers for each past spike were not exported in this document; they can be pulled via the Google Trends compare-date parameter for more granular statistics.  \n   \u2022 No U.S. media schedules for possible congressional hearings on the South Caucasus during the forecast window were located; those could add modest search traffic if announced.\n\nOverall, the historical record indicates that U.S. search interest in \u201carmenia\u201d experiences short, event-driven bursts that fade within two weeks. None of the currently scheduled events between 17 Feb and 28 Feb 2026 possess the characteristics that generated previous large-scale spikes (violent conflict, major U.S. diplomatic action, or the 24 April genocide commemoration).</Agent_report>\n\n<GoogleTrendsData term=\"armenia\">\nGoogle Trends US data for \"armenia\" (last 90 days):\n\nCurrent value: 90\n90-day mean: 70.1\n90-day std dev: 9.6\n\nBASE RATE ANALYSIS (using 11-day windows to match question timeframe):\n- In 28% of 11-day windows, the value changed by \u22643 points (\"Doesn't change\")\n- In 42% of 11-day windows, the value INCREASED by >3 points\n- In 30% of 11-day windows, the value DECREASED by >3 points\n\nRecent trend: decreasing (last 7 days avg: 76.3 vs prior 7 days: 83.6)\n\nDAILY VALUES (last 30 days):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-19,67\n2026-01-20,73\n2026-01-21,82\n2026-01-22,73\n2026-01-23,74\n2026-01-24,71\n2026-01-25,75\n2026-01-26,76\n2026-01-27,73\n2026-01-28,71\n2026-01-29,82\n2026-01-30,79\n2026-01-31,78\n2026-02-01,90\n2026-02-02,78\n2026-02-03,59\n2026-02-04,68\n2026-02-05,86\n2026-02-06,71\n2026-02-07,98\n2026-02-08,72\n2026-02-09,90\n2026-02-10,100\n2026-02-11,84\n2026-02-12,64\n2026-02-13,70\n2026-02-14,64\n2026-02-15,71\n2026-02-16,91\n2026-02-17,90\n\nNote: Google Trends values are relative (0-100 scale), not absolute search volumes.\n</GoogleTrendsData>\n"
