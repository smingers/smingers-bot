## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- Current value 3.19% (Feb 12) with recent widening trend from 2.86% (Jan 6) - **factual, authoritative**
- 30-day volatility 0.13% with typical daily moves 3-7bp - **factual, recent pattern**
- Spread remains below historical means (1-yr: 3.17%, 5-yr: 3.80%, 10-yr: 4.22%) - **structural context**

**Moderate Evidence:**
- BofA survey showing elevated risk sentiment (Bull & Bear at 9.5 "sell zone") - **suggests widening pressure**
- Multiple experts (Rowat, BlackRock) noting tight spreads and limited value - **directional signal**
- Recent correlation between equity weakness and spread widening (Nov 18 episode) - **established mechanism**
- Default rate at 4.6% vs historical lows - **credit quality deterioration**

**Weak Evidence:**
- Prediction of spreads reaching 1.5-2% by April (different index, speculative) - **uncertain timing/magnitude**
- J.P. Morgan macro concerns (indirect impact on single-B spreads) - **general risk sentiment**
- ETF positioning changes (no clear directional signal) - **neutral activity**

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 8 calendar days (Feb 17-25, 2026)

**If halved to 4 days**: Would expect even tighter distribution around 3.19%, with range likely 3.10-3.28% (one standard deviation ~0.05%). Status quo bias would dominate.

**If doubled to 16 days**: Would expand distribution significantly - 16-day volatility ~0.18% suggests range of 3.00-3.40% for one standard deviation. Greater chance for trend continuation or reversal; more exposure to macro events.

**Current 8-day assessment**: Short enough that dramatic moves are unlikely without major shock; long enough for modest trend continuation or mean reversion. Recent stability (3.09-3.23% over past week) suggests consolidation phase.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view baseline**: 10th: 3.00, 50th: ~3.18, 90th: 3.40

**Factors warranting adjustment:**

1. **Recent stabilization** (Strong): Last 5 trading days show range of only 3.09-3.19%, suggesting consolidation after January's widening. This argues for **tighter distribution** than outside view.

2. **Elevated risk sentiment** (Moderate): BofA survey at "sell zone" + multiple experts noting tight valuations suggests **upward bias** (widening pressure).

3. **Below historical means** (Strong): At 3.19% vs 5-year mean of 3.80%, there's **structural room for widening** rather than tightening.

4. **Short timeframe** (Strong): 8 days limits extreme moves; **status quo bias** should be strong.

5. **Default rate elevation** (Moderate): 4.6% default rate vs <2% in 2022 suggests **fundamental deterioration** supporting wider spreads.

**Net adjustment**: Slight upward shift in median (3.19% → 3.21%) and modest tightening of distribution due to recent consolidation, but maintaining upward skew due to widening bias.

## Distribution Calibration

**Central tendency**: Current 3.19% with slight upward bias to 3.20-3.22% given:
- Recent consolidation suggests near-term stability
- But elevated risk sentiment and below-mean positioning favor widening over tightening

**Volatility calibration**: 
- 30-day std dev of 0.13% × √(8/30) ≈ 0.067%
- Recent 5-day range: 10bp (3.09-3.19%)
- 8-day range should be slightly wider: 15-20bp reasonable

**Tail calibration**:
- **10th percentile (downside)**: Modest tightening scenario - 3.04% (15bp tighter). Would require risk-on sentiment shift; unlikely given elevated risk indicators.
- **90th percentile (upside)**: Continued widening scenario - 3.38% (19bp wider). Consistent with trend + risk sentiment; plausible if equity markets weaken.

**Distribution shape**: Slight positive skew (widening bias) given:
- Structural position below historical means
- Elevated risk sentiment
- Expert skepticism on high-yield value
- But constrained by short timeframe and recent consolidation

**Final calibration**:
- 10th: 3.04 (conservative tightening)
- 20th: 3.10 (modest tightening to 30-day mean)
- 40th: 3.17 (slight tightening from current)
- 60th: 3.24 (modest widening continuation)
- 80th: 3.32 (significant widening)
- 90th: 3.38 (tail widening scenario)

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: ICE BofA Single-B US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread value (percent) on Feb 25, 2026 (8 days from Feb 17).

2. **Outside view base rate**: 10th: 3.00, 50th: ~3.18, 90th: 3.40. My prediction shifts slightly upward (median 3.20 vs 3.18) with tighter distribution due to recent consolidation, maintaining upward skew from risk sentiment.

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median ≈ 3.20%; mean ≈ 3.21%. This aligns with current value (3.19%) plus modest widening bias from elevated risk sentiment and below-mean positioning.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Current 3.19% with recent 5-day consolidation (3.09-3.19%) - suggests near-term stability
   - BofA Bull & Bear indicator at 9.5 "sell zone" - elevated risk sentiment favors widening
   - Spread 61bp below 5-year mean (3.80%) - structural room for widening
   - 30-day volatility 0.13% with 8-day horizon - limits extreme moves
   - Default rate 4.6% vs 2022 lows <2% - fundamental deterioration

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Unexpected Fed dovish pivot or major positive economic surprise could trigger rapid spread tightening to 2.90-3.00% range, making my 10th percentile (3.04%) look too conservative. Would push outcome DOWN.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Current 3.19% with 8-day horizon strongly favors minimal change. Recent consolidation reinforces this. My median of 3.20% appropriately reflects this with only +1bp adjustment.

7. **Technicalities**: Values strictly increasing ✓; units in Percent ✓; all values within bounds (2.26-5.36) ✓; 10th (3.04) < 90th (3.38) ✓
