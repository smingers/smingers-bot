Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**FRED Data Sources (fred.stlouisfed.org, alfred.stlouisfed.org):**
- Primary data provider for BAMLH0A2HYB series
- Most recent observation: 3.19% on 2026-02-12
- High quality, authoritative source directly from Federal Reserve
- Provides historical statistics: 1-year mean=3.17%, 5-year mean=3.80%, 10-year mean=4.22%, all-time mean=5.21%
- All-time range: 2.36% (June 2007) to 20.84% (November 2008)

**Trading Economics:**
- Reports same current value (3.19% in February 2026)
- Confirms historical extremes
- Factual data aggregator, no analysis or opinions

**Investopedia Article:**
- Educational content on credit spreads generally
- Notes typical BBB-rated corporate spreads vs Treasuries: 2-4%+ in normal conditions
- Narrow spreads (~1%) indicate investor confidence; widening spreads signal concern
- No specific forecasts; general educational material

**Janus Henderson Insights (December 23, 2025):**
- **Expert opinions from named portfolio managers**: Brent Olson and Tom Ross
- Key facts: US high yield yields at 6.7% (Nov 30, 2025); CCC spreads near 20-year average
- **Expert view**: Expect 2026 performance similar to 2025, with income as primary return source; "later in credit cycle" with "richer valuations" arguing for selectivity
- **Prediction**: "Would not be surprised to see spreads compress in the first half of 2026"
- Risks identified: over-leveraged companies, trade volatility, inflation fears
- High quality source with identifiable experts; published before recent widening

**ECB Financial Stability Review (May 21, 2025):**
- Notes credit spreads "out of sync with underlying credit risk" 
- Identifies risks from US tariffs (April 2025 announcement caused volatility)
- Concerns about open-ended funds and liquidity stress
- European perspective; less directly relevant to US single-B spreads

**Agent Report:**
- Confirms 30-day average OAS (Jan 12 - Feb 12, 2026): 3.10%
- 30-day standard deviation: 0.13%
- Documents widening trend: from 2.86% (Jan 6) to 3.19% (Feb 12) = +33 bp (+11%)
- Notes spread remains below 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year means despite recent widening
- High quality technical analysis

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Short-term daily volatility (8-day forecast horizon):**
   - Agent report shows 30-day std dev = 0.13%
   - Recent daily moves: typically 3-14 bp
   - Most suitable for this 8-day forecast

2. **Monthly changes:**
   - FRED data: 1-month change = +0.26% (+8.9%)
   - Less suitable due to longer timeframe

3. **Historical stability periods:**
   - When spreads are in "tight" regime (below long-term mean), they tend to be relatively stable
   - Current 3.19% is below 5-year mean (3.80%) and 10-year mean (4.22%)
   - Suitable context for baseline expectation

**Selected reference class**: Short-term daily volatility during stable market periods, with current spread at 3.19% and 30-day mean at 3.10%.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 8 days (from Feb 17 to Feb 25, 2026)

**Recent 8-day patterns:**
- Feb 4-12: Range 3.09-3.23% (14 bp range)
- Jan 29-Feb 6: Range 2.99-3.23% (24 bp range)
- Typical daily absolute change: 3-7 bp
- Maximum recent daily change: ~14 bp

**Trend context:**
- Widening trend since early January (+33 bp over ~5 weeks)
- Current level (3.19%) slightly above 30-day mean (3.10%)
- Expert opinion (Janus Henderson) expected potential spread compression in H1 2026
- However, that opinion predated the recent widening

## (d) Justification

The 8-day forecast horizon is very short, suggesting the outcome will likely be close to the current value of 3.19%. Key factors:

1. **Statistical baseline**: With 30-day std dev of 0.13% and typical daily moves of 3-7 bp, an 8-day period would have expected volatility of roughly 0.13% × √(8/30) ≈ 0.07%, suggesting a range of approximately 3.12-3.26% for one standard deviation.

2. **Recent trend**: The widening from 2.86% (Jan 6) to 3.19% (Feb 12) represents a significant move, but the pace has moderated in recent days (relatively stable 3.09-3.19% range in the last week).

3. **Market context**: Despite recent widening, spreads remain historically tight (below 1-year, 5-year, and 10-year means). This suggests limited room for dramatic tightening but potential for further modest widening if risk sentiment deteriorates.

4. **Expert opinion caveat**: Janus Henderson's December expectation of H1 2026 spread compression has not materialized; instead spreads widened. This suggests either their timing was off or market conditions changed (possibly related to ECB-noted tariff concerns).

5. **Short timeframe advantage**: With only 8 days, barring a major market shock, mean reversion and random walk dynamics should dominate, keeping the outcome near current levels.

## Outside View Calibration

For an 8-day forecast with current value at 3.19%:

- **Central tendency**: Should be anchored near 3.19%, with slight consideration for the 30-day mean of 3.10%
- **Volatility estimate**: 30-day std dev of 0.13% suggests 8-day moves could reasonably span ±0.10-0.15%
- **Asymmetry**: Recent widening trend suggests slightly higher probability of further widening than dramatic tightening
- **Tail risks**: 
  - Downside (tightening): Historical minimum is 2.36%, but reaching below 2.90% in 8 days would require ~30 bp tightening (unprecedented in recent data)
  - Upside (widening): Could see 3.40-3.50% if risk-off sentiment accelerates, but 3.60%+ would require significant market stress

**Distribution calibration**:
- 10th percentile: Should capture downside scenario with modest tightening
- 50th percentile (median): Near current value with slight upward bias
- 90th percentile: Should capture scenario of continued widening without full crisis

Given the tight recent range and short timeframe, I'll set relatively narrow but realistic intervals:
