Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**High-Quality Primary Sources:**
1. **FRED/YCharts data (Feb 12, 2026)**: Factual, authoritative. Latest value 3.19%, up from 3.09% on Feb 11. Recent trend shows +38 bp rise from ~2.81% on Jan 16 to 3.19% on Feb 12. Historical context: long-term average 5.21%, recent low 2.36% (June 2007), high 20.84% (Nov 2008).

2. **Trading Economics (Feb 2026)**: Replicates FRED data. Confirms 3.19% reading. No forward analysis.

**Moderate-Quality Sources:**
3. **J.P. Morgan 2026 Outlook (Dec 9, 2025)**: Bruce Kasman (Chief Global Economist) expects inflation to stay elevated, labor markets to tighten, central banks won't cut as much as markets expect. 35% recession probability. Relevant but 2+ months stale for a 6-day forecast.

4. **Goldman Sachs Fixed Income Outlook Q1 2026**: Fed on pause, sensitive to labor market weakness. Low bar to further cuts if unemployment rises. ECB firmly on hold. Spreads described as "historically tight" with "little room for error." Moderate relevance.

5. **BlackRock Fixed Income Outlook**: Rick Rieder notes "historically tight" spread conditions making it "difficult to find opportunities." Relevant directional signal but no specific Single-B spread forecast.

**Weak/Tangential Sources:**
6. **BofA Fund Manager Survey (Feb 2025)**: 50% cite "long gold" as most crowded trade. 25% identify "AI bubble" as top tail risk. 43% cite private equity/credit as potential systemic crisis source. Suggests elevated risk perception but indirect.

7. **Various ETF/institutional trading articles**: Describe fund flows into high-yield ETFs but lack predictive value for 6-day horizon.

8. **Bitcoin/credit spread correlation article (Feb 3, 2026)**: Notes ICE BofA Corporate OAS remains compressed despite elevated debt. Predicts spreads could rise to 1.5-2% by April 2026. However, this refers to investment-grade corporate spreads, not Single-B high-yield.

9. **November 2025 spread widening article**: High-yield spreads widened 6 bp on Nov 18, 2025 during equity selloff. Investment-grade widened from 83 to 84 bp. Portfolio manager quoted: "I don't see it blowing up in the high-yield...bond market." Shows spreads can move quickly but recover.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Recent momentum (factual)**: +38 bp widening from Jan 16 (2.81%) to Feb 12 (3.19%) over ~4 weeks. This represents accelerating widening trend. However, last daily change was only +10 bp (Feb 11→12), suggesting momentum may be moderating.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Expert consensus on tight spreads**: Multiple sources (Goldman, BlackRock, BofA survey) independently note spreads are "historically tight" with "little room for error." Current 3.19% vs. long-term average 5.21% confirms this. Tight spreads can persist but create asymmetric risk (easier to widen than tighten further).
- **Macro backdrop**: Fed on pause, inflation elevated, labor market concerns. Creates environment where spreads could widen on negative surprises, but no imminent catalyst identified in 6-day window.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **BofA survey tail risks**: AI bubble concerns and private credit worries suggest elevated risk perception, but these are slow-burn risks unlikely to materialize in 6 days.
- **Historical volatility patterns**: Nov 2025 example shows 6 bp single-day widening is possible during equity stress, but recovered quickly.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 6 U.S. business days (Feb 17-25, 2026). No major macro events scheduled (no Fed meeting, CPI release, or month-end effects).

**If halved to 3 days**: Would narrow distribution significantly. Historical 3-day σ ≈ 5 bp. Would center tighter around 3.18-3.20% with 10th-90th range perhaps 3.10-3.28%.

**If doubled to 12 days**: Would widen distribution. Historical 12-day σ ≈ 10 bp. Would need to account for potential month-end effects and greater chance of idiosyncratic credit events. 10th-90th range might expand to 3.05-3.40%.

## (d) Justification for Adjustments

**Factors supporting wider distribution vs. outside view:**
1. **Recent volatility elevated**: The +38 bp move over 4 weeks (Jan 16-Feb 12) is above typical. This suggests current market conditions may have higher volatility than the 10-year average.
2. **Asymmetric risk from tight spreads**: At 3.19% vs. 5.21% long-term average, there's more room for widening than tightening. Expert consensus confirms this.
3. **Elevated macro uncertainty**: Multiple sources cite heightened risk perception (AI bubble, private credit concerns, labor market sensitivity).

**Factors supporting status quo/tighter distribution:**
1. **No imminent catalyst**: No major data releases or events in 6-day window.
2. **Recent momentum may be exhausting**: Last daily change (+10 bp) was smaller than prior moves, suggesting trend may be stabilizing.
3. **Historical mean reversion**: Spreads tend to oscillate around levels rather than trend continuously.

**Net adjustment**: Modest upward shift in median (from 3.18% to 3.20%) to reflect recent momentum and asymmetric risk. Slightly wider tails (especially upside) to account for elevated volatility environment. However, changes are modest given short timeframe and lack of immediate catalysts.

## Distribution Calibration

Starting from outside view (centered at 3.18%, σ = 0.07%):
- Recent 4-week trend suggests current level may already be 3.19-3.20% (not 3.18%)
- Elevated volatility environment suggests σ closer to 0.08%
- Asymmetric risk (easier to widen) adds +1-2 bp to upper percentiles

**Adjusted distribution:**
- Median shifts from 3.19% to 3.20% (reflecting current level + slight momentum)
- 10th percentile: 3.08% (allowing for sharp tightening if risk-on sentiment emerges)
- 90th percentile: 3.38% (allowing for widening on negative surprise or continued momentum)
- Middle percentiles (20th-80th) span 3.12-3.30%, capturing ±10-12 bp range

This represents a modest widening vs. outside view (+2 bp median shift, +3 bp on 90th percentile) justified by recent momentum and asymmetric risk, while maintaining discipline that 6 days is too short for dramatic structural changes.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: ICE BofA Single-B US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread value on Feb 25, 2026 (6 business days ahead), in percent. ✓

2. **Base rate**: Outside view centered at 3.18%, σ = 0.07%, range 3.09-3.35%. My prediction shifts median up 2 bp to 3.20% and widens tails slightly to 3.08-3.38%, justified by recent momentum and asymmetric risk from tight spreads. ✓

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median = 3.20%; mean ≈ 3.21% (slight right skew). Aligns with recent trend continuation plus modest volatility. ✓

4. **Key evidence pieces**:
   - Recent +38 bp widening trend Jan 16-Feb 12 (factual, strong)
   - Current 3.19% well below 5.21% long-term average (factual, strong)
   - Multiple expert sources cite "historically tight" spreads (moderate)
   - No major catalysts in 6-day window (factual, moderate)
   - Elevated risk perception in BofA survey (weak)

5. **Blind spot**: Unexpected positive economic surprise (strong jobs/retail data leak) could trigger risk-on rally, tightening spreads 15-20 bp to ~3.00%. This would make my forecast look too conservative on the downside.

6. **Status quo**: Current level 3.19%. Given short 6-day window and no catalysts, strong pull toward status quo. My median of 3.20% reflects this with only +1 bp drift. ✓

7. **Technicalities**: Values strictly increasing ✓. Units in percent ✓. Range 3.08-3.38% within bounds (2.26-5.36%) ✓.
