## (a) Source Analysis

**FRED Data Sources (fred.stlouisfed.org, alfred.stlouisfed.org):**
High-quality primary data source. Most recent value: 3.19% on 2026-02-12. Historical statistics show all-time mean of 5.21%, 10-year mean of 4.22%, 5-year mean of 3.80%, and 1-year mean of 3.17%. The series has ranged from 2.36% (June 2007) to 20.84% (November 2008). Current value is near historical lows.

**Trading Economics:**
Secondary data aggregator confirming the same values and historical extremes. No analytical content.

**Investopedia Article:**
Educational content explaining credit spread mechanics. Notes that spreads widen during economic uncertainty and narrow during confidence. High-yield spreads typically range 2-4%+ above Treasuries for BBB-rated bonds, with B-rated bonds commanding wider spreads. This is factual background, not predictive.

**Janus Henderson Insights (December 23, 2025):**
Expert opinion from named portfolio managers Brent Olson and Tom Ross. Key facts: US high yield yields at 6.7% as of November 30, 2025. CCC-rated spreads widened in 2025 and are near 20-year averages. **Expert opinion**: Expect similar performance in 2026 with income as primary return source; acknowledge being "later in credit cycle" with "richer valuations"; would not be surprised to see spreads compress in first half of 2026. Note: This refers to broader high-yield market, not specifically single-B spreads.

**ECB Financial Stability Review (May 21, 2025):**
Authoritative institutional source. Documents April 2025 tariff-related volatility that caused market sell-offs. Notes credit spreads appear "out of sync with underlying credit risk" and remain compressed. Identifies risks of disorderly price adjustments in stretched markets. This is backward-looking to May 2025, predating recent spread widening.

**MeDirect/Janus Henderson Article:**
Same expert source as above, reinforcing 2026 outlook of selectivity and modest spread movements.

**Agent Report:**
Provides technical analysis showing 30-day average OAS of 3.10% with standard deviation of 0.13% as of February 12, 2026. Documents the recent trend: spread widened from 2.86% on January 6, 2026 to 3.19% on February 12, 2026 (+33 bp, +11.5%). Notes spreads remain tight by historical standards despite recent widening.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **13-day forward movements (Jan 6 - Feb 12, 2026 analog):** The spread moved +33 bp over 37 calendar days (26 business days). For the 13 calendar days (9 business days) from Feb 12 to Feb 25, a proportional move would be ~12 bp. However, this assumes continuation of the recent trend.

2. **Short-term daily volatility:** The 30-day standard deviation is 0.13%, suggesting typical daily moves are small. Over 9 business days, random walk would suggest σ√9 ≈ 0.39% range.

3. **Historical 2-week changes:** Examining recent data shows typical 2-week changes range from -0.15% to +0.20% in normal conditions.

4. **Stable regime assumption:** Given the spread has been in a tight range (2.86-3.23%) for the past 6 weeks, mean reversion or continuation within this band is plausible.

**Most suitable reference class:** Short-term movements within the current regime (2.86-3.23% range established in January-February 2026), combined with historical 2-week volatility patterns.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 13 calendar days (9 business days) from February 12 to February 25, 2026.

**Historical patterns over similar periods:**
- Recent daily values show the spread oscillating: 3.06→3.14→3.06→3.09→3.11→3.23→3.12→3.10→3.13→3.09→3.19
- Daily changes typically range from -0.14% to +0.14%
- The largest single-day move in recent data was +0.12% (Feb 4-5)
- Over 9 business days, cumulative moves have ranged from -0.10% to +0.20% in the recent period

**Key observations:**
- The spread is currently at 3.19%, near the upper end of the recent 6-week range
- No major economic events are scheduled in the next 13 days that would typically cause large spread movements
- The 1-month mean is 3.10%, suggesting potential mean reversion
- Historical volatility suggests moves larger than ±0.30% over 9 days are uncommon but possible

## (d) Justification

The ICE BofA Single-B US High Yield Index OAS currently stands at 3.19% as of February 12, 2026. Over the next 13 days to February 25, several factors inform the outside view:

**Central tendency:** The recent 30-day mean of 3.10% and the current value of 3.19% suggest the spread is slightly elevated. Mean reversion would pull toward 3.10%, but momentum from the January widening trend (2.86%→3.19%) could persist. The 1-year mean of 3.17% provides another anchor point very close to current levels.

**Volatility bounds:** The 30-day standard deviation of 0.13% and typical 2-week historical ranges suggest movements of ±0.20-0.30% are reasonable for the 80% confidence interval. Larger moves would require significant market events.

**Regime considerations:** The spread remains historically tight (10-year mean: 4.22%, all-time mean: 5.21%). Expert opinion from Janus Henderson suggests potential for further spread compression in H1 2026, though they acknowledge late-cycle risks. The ECB noted spreads appear "out of sync with underlying credit risk," suggesting potential for widening if risk reassessment occurs.

**Tail risks:** While unlikely over 13 days, extreme events could push spreads significantly wider (toward 4.0%+) or tighter (toward 2.6%). The all-time low of 2.36% and recent local low of 2.86% provide lower bounds; the 1-year high of 4.86% provides an upper reference.

Outside view calibration:

The prediction must balance several considerations:

1. **Central tendency:** Current value (3.19%) vs recent mean (3.10%) vs 1-year mean (3.17%) suggests a distribution centered around 3.10-3.20%.

2. **Short-term volatility:** With 30-day σ = 0.13% and 9 business days ahead, a random walk suggests ~0.39% as the 1-σ range. However, spreads show mean-reverting behavior, so pure random walk overstates tails.

3. **Recent range:** The 6-week range of 2.86-3.23% (37 bp wide) provides empirical bounds for the 80% interval. Extending slightly beyond this range for the 90% interval is prudent.

4. **Asymmetric risks:** Tail risk is slightly skewed toward widening (economic shock, credit event) rather than extreme tightening, as spreads are already historically tight. The 90th percentile should reflect this.

5. **Calibration to historical patterns:** 
   - 10th percentile: Should capture scenario where spreads compress toward recent lows, approximately 2.90%
   - 20th percentile: Modest compression, approximately 3.00%
   - 40th percentile: Slight compression or stability, approximately 3.10%
   - 60th percentile: Current level or slight widening, approximately 3.20%
   - 80th percentile: Continuation of widening trend, approximately 3.35%
   - 90th percentile: Significant widening from risk event, approximately 3.50%

These values create a distribution with median around 3.15%, slightly above the 30-day mean but below current level, reflecting mild mean reversion with upside skew for tail risk.
