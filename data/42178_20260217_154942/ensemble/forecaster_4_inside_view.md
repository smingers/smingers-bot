Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED (BAMLH0A2HYB, 13 Feb 2026 update) – primary data source; last value 3.19 % on 12 Feb 2026. 100 % factual, highest reliability.  
2. Y-Charts / Trading Economics pages (12 Feb 2026) – repeat FRED figure, give one-year and long-run averages. Good quality but secondary. Pure facts, no forecast.  
3. JP Morgan 2026 Market Outlook (Dec 2025) – named experts; forecasts resilient growth, central-bank “on hold”, 35 % recession risk. Moderate quality, some bias.  
4. Goldman Sachs AM Fixed-Income Outlook 1Q 2026 (Jan 2026) – named experts; view: Fed leaning dovish, spreads could stay tight but risks from labour-market weakness. Moderate quality.  
5. BlackRock FI Outlook (Jan 2026) – named experts; notes spreads “historically tight” and little margin for error. Moderate quality.  
6. Reuters Nov 2025 note – factual widening of HY spreads six bp in one day; shows spreads can jump on risk-off. Reliable for historical behaviour.  
7. Recent Treasury-yield articles (17 Feb 2026, Investing.com) – factual: 10-yr at 4.04 %, near fair value; neutral credit implication.  
No other source provides a point forecast for the Single-B OAS in the next eight days.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong: FRED time-series history – shows normal weekly volatility ≈ 7 bps, fat-right-tail events but rare.  
Moderate: Consensus macro outlook (JPM, GS, BlackRock) – central banks on pause, growth ok, but caution on credit valuation; implies slight bias toward wider spreads.  
Weak: Idiosyncratic stock or ETF flows – largely noise for an 8-day horizon.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon = 8 calendar days (~6 trading days). If window were halved (3 days) I would cut std-dev roughly √(3/6) and pull tails inward ~25 bps → 15 bps. If doubled (16 days) I would widen tails another ~25 bps.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view (daily history) centre ≈ 3.15 %.  
Current level 3.19 % has been drifting up since mid-January; macro commentary tilts modestly risk-off. That nudges mean +0.03 %.  
Right-tail (widening) probability a bit higher than left-tail (tightening) because spreads already tight and valuation risk noted by several experts.  
No scheduled major risk catalyst before 25 Feb (no FOMC meeting, no jobs report), so extreme moves (>40 bps) still low-probability (<10 %).  
Blend yields the calibrated distribution below.

Distribution calibration
Centred on 3.18 %, 1-σ (6 trading-day) ≈ 0.07 %. Added asymmetric fat tail: +0.4 % with 10 % weight, -0.3 % with 10 % weight.

Checklist:  
1. Target = ICE BofA Single-B OAS (%) at close 25 Feb 2026 as published by FRED.  
2. Outside-view percentiles (2.85,2.95,3.08,3.20,3.40,3.65) used as anchor.  
3. Implied mean ≈ 3.18 %, median ≈ 3.20 %; consistent with slight upward drift.  
4. Key evidence: a) current value 3.19 %; b) typical 1-week σ ≈ 7 bps; c) expert comments “spreads tight, risk up”; d) no imminent macro shock scheduled.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden equity sell-off or geopolitical shock causing >50 bp spike (would push outcome >3.7 %).  
6. Status-quo bias acknowledged; slight nudge toward current 3.19 %.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, in percent units, within open bounds.
