Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED/Y-Charts/TradingEconomics pages (Feb-12-2026 datapoint = 3.19 %) – machine-readable, primary data, no opinions. Highest quality.  
2. Short-dated articles on UST fair-value (CapitalSpectator/Investing.com, 17-Feb-26) – discuss rates, not spreads; give current 10-y yield 4.04 %. Reasonably reliable but only indirectly relevant.  
3. Sell-side 2026 outlooks (J.P. Morgan, Goldman Sachs, BlackRock, Dec-25/Jan-26) – identifiable experts; broad macro guidance (solid growth, cautious credit). Medium quality, but horizon >6 days ⇒ limited weight.  
4. Reuters 18-Nov-25 note on wider HY spreads – dated and already reflected in level history.  
5. Miscellaneous ETF-flow stories – anecdotal, very small influence on index level. Weak.  

(b) Evidence weighing  
Strong: none (no acute stress headlines, no policy shock scheduled).  
Moderate:  
• Current level 3.19 % sits near top of one-month range (2.99–3.23 %); short-term momentum mildly upward.  
• 10-year Treasury hovering at 4 %; no evidence of imminent rate spike >4.15 % (fair-value article).  
Weak: macro outlook pieces hint at fragile risk sentiment; ETF flow stories.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon = 8 calendar / 6 trading days. Historical σ(6-day) ≈ 0.17 %. Halving horizon would cut σ to ≈0.12 %; doubling (to 12 trading days) would raise σ to ≈0.25 %, but mean unchanged unless a new catalyst emerged.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view (2024-26 quiet-regime) gave median 3.15 %, 1-σ ≈0.20 %.  
Inside view tweaks:  
• Recent gentle widening (+10 bp in eight sessions) bids median up ~0.05 % to 3.20 %.  
• Treasury market stable lessens upside tail risk; downside tail (tightening) also limited because spread is already only 40 bp above 12-month low.  
• No scheduled macro event with historical record of >20 bp weekly impact.  
Therefore shift centre to 3.22 %. Keep tails a little fatter than Gaussian (p10–p90 span 0.55 %) to respect “unknown-unknown” shock probability (~5 % of weeks).

Evidence weighting summary  
Moderate evidence of slight widening bias (+)  
Weak evidence of credit-risk scare (+)  
Moderate evidence of benign rates backdrop (- to widening)  
Net effect: small upward tilt vs outside view.

Checklist:  
1. Target = FRED series BAMLH0A2HYB, percent, observation dated 25-Feb-2026.  
2. Outside view stated and used as anchor.  
3. Implied median ≈ 3.22 %, mean ≈ 3.23 %; matches justification for mild upward drift.  
4. Key evidence: (i) last datapoint 3.19 %; (ii) one-month upward trend +33 bp; (iii) historical 6-day σ 17 bp; (iv) 10-y UST stable near 4 %; (v) no crisis headlines.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden risk-off sell-off (e.g., bank failure) would push spread >3.6 %.  
6. Status-quo check nudges forecast only slightly upward.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units = percent; lie well within open bounds.
