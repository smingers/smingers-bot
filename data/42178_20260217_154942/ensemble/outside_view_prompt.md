You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
What will be the value of "ICE BofA Single-B US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread" on 2026-02-25?

Question background:
The Federal Reserve Economic Data database (FRED) provides economic data from national, international, public, and private sources. The series BAMLH0A2HYB is a dataset that is tracked by the FRED API. It represents the option-adjusted spread of securities with an investment grade rating of B in the ICE BofA US High Yield Master II Index, which tracks the performance of corporate debt below investment grade in the US domestic market. The title of the series is "ICE BofA Single-B US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread". The last data point on the graph (as of creation of this question) is from 2026-02-12 and has a value of 3.19. The units of the series are "Percent". The update frequency of the series is "Daily". The seasonal adjustment of the series is "Not Seasonally Adjusted". An interactive graph for the series can be found [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLH0A2HYB). Below are the notes attached to the series:

> This data represents the Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) of the ICE BofA US Corporate B Index, a subset of the ICE BofA US High Yield Master II Index tracking the performance of US dollar denominated below investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. This subset includes all securities with a given investment grade rating B.
> The ICE BofA OASs are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.

# Summary of Article: "Credit Spread: What It Means for Bonds and Options Strategy"

**Source:** Investopedia

## Key Definitions and Concepts:

**Credit Spread (Bonds):**
- The difference in yield between two debt securities with different credit quality but the same maturity
- Measured in basis points (1 basis point = 0.01%)
- Example: If a 10-year Treasury yields 5% and a 10-year corporate bond yields 7%, the credit spread is 2% or 200 basis points

**Types of Bond Credit Spreads:**
- Corporate bond spread: Difference between corporate bond yield and government bond with similar maturity
- Emerging market bond spread: Difference between emerging market bond and developed market bond yields
- High-yield spread: Difference between junk bond yield and government bond yield (generally wider due to greater credit risk)

## Economic Interpretation:

**Typical Spread Ranges (in normal economic conditions):**
- High-quality corporate bonds (AAA-rated) vs. 10-year Treasurys: 1% to 2%
- Lower-quality corporate bonds (BBB-rated) vs. 10-year Treasurys: 2% to 4% or more

**Spread Interpretation:**
- **Narrow spreads (close to 1%):** Indicate investor confidence in economic outlook and low perceived default risk; common during strong economic conditions
- **Widening spreads:** Signal increased economic concern and risk aversion; investors demand higher yields to compensate for perceived higher default risks

**Historical Context:**
The article notes that yield spread spikes occurred following:
- September 11, 2001 events
- 2007-2008 financial crisis
- The pandemic

These events were marked by economic uncertainty affecting bond markets.

## Credit Spread Formula:

Credit Spread (bond) = (1 – Recovery Rate) × (Default Probability)

Where:
- Recovery Rate = percentage of investment expected to be recovered in event of default
- Default Probability = likelihood of issuer not meeting debt obligations

**Note:** The article acknowledges this formula is a simplification and doesn't account for all factors influencing credit spreads, such as liquidity risk, market sentiment, and specific bond cash flow characteristics.

## Additional Facts:
- Credit spreads are larger for riskier debts (emerging markets, lower-rated corporations)
- Spreads are larger for bonds with longer maturities
- U.S. government bonds are considered virtually risk-free

# Summary of Janus Henderson Insights Article

**Source:** MeDirect  
**Date:** December 23, 2025  
**Authors:** Brent Olson (Portfolio Manager) and Tom Ross (Head of High Yield) at Janus Henderson Investors

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **2025 Performance:** High yield bonds delivered positive total returns in 2025, broadly reflecting their yields.

2. **Economic Growth Projections:** Modest economic growth is projected for 2026, similar to recent years (specific percentages shown in Figure 1, though exact values not provided in extracted text).

3. **US High Yield Bond Yields (as of November 30, 2025):** 6.7%

4. **European High Yield Bond Yields (as of November 30, 2025):** 5.1%

5. **Coupon Rates on Newly Issued US Dollar High Yield Bonds:**
   - 2023: 8-9%
   - Late 2025: ~7.2%
   - Existing bonds weighted average coupon: 6.6%

6. **Credit Spreads:** Spreads for lower quality bonds (CCC or lower rated) widened during 2025 and are near their 20-year average.

7. **Historical Context:** The average coupon on US high yield bonds increased during 2025 as low coupon bonds (5-6% from 2020-21) were refinanced at higher rates.

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

**Outlook for 2026:**
- Expect similar performance to 2025, with income being the primary source of returns
- A resilient economy should enable defaults to be contained
- Acknowledge being "later in the credit cycle" with valuations at "richer levels," arguing for a more selective approach

**Economic Factors:**
- Modest economic growth in 2026 should support cashflows without igniting major inflation concerns
- US tax cuts expected to boost capex and help consumers
- German government spending uplift expected to support European regional economy
- Earnings growth expected to remain positive in 2026
- M&A activity could rise as companies seek market share and regulators become more amenable to corporate mergers

**Market Dynamics:**
- Observing "bifurcation in the market" between higher and lower quality bonds
- Bond prices of higher quality names have risen as investors seek yield defensively, tightening credit spreads on BB rated bonds
- Spreads widened among lower quality names (CCC or lower)
- Would not be surprised to see spreads compress in the first half of 2026

**Risks Identified:**
- Some companies are over-leveraged and operationally vulnerable
- Potential risks include economic deterioration, trade volatility, or fresh inflation fears

**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off at the end, so the final sentence about risks is incomplete.

# Summary of ECB Financial Stability Review, May 2025

**Source:** European Central Bank, May 21, 2025

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Recent Market Events:**
   - US Administration announced new tariffs in April 2025, causing a spike in financial market volatility
   - On April 2, 2025, higher than expected US import tariffs were announced, triggering market sell-offs with magnitudes not seen since early COVID-19 pandemic
   - Markets rebounded strongly after a 90-day tariff pause was announced for most countries and had mostly recovered initial losses by mid-May

2. **Market Behavior:**
   - Global financial markets sold off at "unsettling speed" in early April
   - Financial conditions tightened considerably
   - Risky assets have been recovering losses since temporary tariff pauses were announced
   - Markets remain highly sensitive to news about global trade arrangements
   - Market functioning in euro area financial markets held up well during the turmoil

3. **Credit Market Conditions:**
   - Credit spreads appear "out of sync with underlying credit risk"
   - Equity valuations remain high despite the drawdowns
   - Open-ended funds investing in corporate bonds have seen some outflows

4. **Economic Outlook:**
   - Risks of an economic slowdown have increased markedly
   - Prospect of slowing economic activity, notably for the United States

## Key Observations from ECB:

- **Vulnerabilities Identified:**
  1. Price adjustments in stretched and concentrated asset markets risk becoming disorderly
  2. Rising trade tensions could affect euro area corporates and households directly (via tariff-sensitive activities) and indirectly (via confidence effects)
  3. Weaker growth combined with defense spending needs could strain fiscal positions of some euro area sovereigns

- **Non-bank Financial Sector:**
  - Open-ended funds investing in corporate bonds "do not appear well prepared to withstand significant liquidity stress"
  - In renewed turmoil, these funds may be forced to sell assets, potentially turning price swings into more disorderly adjustments
  - Signs of rotation in fund flow dynamics from the United States to the euro area

- **Policy Environment:**
  - Uncertainty lingers in many policy domains beyond trade (regulation, national security)
  - Likelihood of increasingly frequent and impactful adverse tail events has increased

**Note:** This article focuses on broader financial stability concerns in the euro area and does not specifically mention the ICE BofA Single-B US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread (BAMLH0A2HYB) by name, though it discusses credit spreads generally.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide daily values for ICE BofA Single-B US High Yield Index OAS (BAMLH0A2HYB) since 2010; compute 30-day mean and standard deviation; describe trend since Jan 2026
1. Availability of the raw daily history  
  • The entire daily time series for ICE BofA Single-B US High Yield Index OAS (series-ID BAMLH0A2HYB) is distributed by ICE Data Indices under license to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and can be accessed programmatically through the public FRED API.  The ALFRED “vintage” page confirms continuous coverage from 2010-01-04 through the latest observation on 2026-02-12 (Alfred.stlouisfed.org, search result 1).  
  • Because ICE expressly prohibits republication of the “Top-Level Data”, the full list of daily observations cannot be reproduced verbatim in this report.  Users must download the data directly (e.g., https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=BAMLH0A2HYB) and accept the FRED terms of use.

2. Computation of the 30-day rolling statistics  
Using the CSV feed above (or the FRED API endpoint …/series/observations?series_id=BAMLH0A2HYB&observation_start=2025-12-31), import the data into any analytics environment (Python, R, Excel) and apply a 30-business-day rolling window:

Python code snippet (illustrative, does not redistribute ICE values):
```python
import pandas as pd, requests, io, datetime as dt
url = ("https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?"
       "id=BAMLH0A2HYB&"
       "observation_start=2010-01-04")
df = pd.read_csv(url, parse_dates=['DATE']).set_index('DATE').sort_index()
df = df.asfreq('B')                                  # align on business days
roll = df['BAMLH0A2HYB'].rolling(window=30, min_periods=30)
df['OAS_30d_mean'] = roll.mean()
df['OAS_30d_std']  = roll.std(ddof=0)
```
The two new columns give, for every business day since February 2010, the 30-day mean and population standard deviation of the option-adjusted spread.

3. Most-recent 30-day summary (as of 2026-02-12)  
Running the code above on 17 February 2026 yields:

• 30-day average OAS (12 Jan – 12 Feb 2026): 3.10 %  
• 30-day population standard deviation: 0.13 %  

(The precise values may differ by ±0.01 pp depending on the time the FRED feed is queried and whether weekend/holiday observations are dropped.)

4. Observed trend since the beginning of January 2026  
Daily closes around year-end were among the tightest of the cycle (2.86 % on 2026-01-06).  From the second week of January the spread began to drift wider:

Date   OAS (%) Change vs 01-06  
2026-01-06 2.86  —  
2026-01-20 2.96  +0.10  
2026-01-30 3.06  +0.20  
2026-02-05 3.23  +0.37 (local high)  
2026-02-12 3.19  +0.33 (latest)  

(FREDData extract, search result 8).

Key points:  
• Magnitude The spread has widened roughly 30–35 bp (+11 %) from its early-January trough.  
• Drivers (market context) Commentary from sell-side and asset-manager outlooks for 2026 notes that high-yield credit spreads entered the year at historically tight levels and that some modest “normalisation” was expected as investors re-priced late-cycle and refinancing risks (GuggenheimInvestments.com; AllianzGI.com – search results 6 & 7).  
• Relative position Even after the recent widening, the single-B OAS (3.19 %) remains below its 1-year mean (3.17 %) and far below the 5-year mean (3.80 %) and the 10-year mean (4.22 %) reported by FRED (search result 8).  In other words, spreads are still tight by longer-term standards.

5. Compliance with the original request  
• “Provide daily values since 2010” – Available via FRED link; cannot be reprinted here because of ICE licensing.  
• “Compute 30-day mean and standard deviation” – Methodology and the latest computed values are provided; rolling columns can be regenerated in the user’s own environment.  
• “Describe trend since Jan 2026” – A clear narrative and quantitative summary of the 2026 YTD movement is included.

6. Information gaps (if any)  
No substantive data gaps remain; access to the raw series and the recipe to reproduce the statistics are supplied.  Users who need intra-day quotations or attribution of daily moves would have to consult proprietary market feeds, as FRED publishes only end-of-day closes.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
