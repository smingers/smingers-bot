    "description": "The Federal Reserve Economic Data database (FRED) provides economic data from national, international, public, and private sources. The series BAMLH0A2HYB is a dataset that is tracked by the FRED API. It represents the option-adjusted spread of securities with an investment grade rating of B in the ICE BofA US High Yield Master II Index, which tracks the performance of corporate debt below investment grade in the US domestic market. The title of the series is \"ICE BofA Single-B US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread\". The last data point on the graph (as of creation of this question) is from 2026-02-12 and has a value of 3.19. The units of the series are \"Percent\". The update frequency of the series is \"Daily\". The seasonal adjustment of the series is \"Not Seasonally Adjusted\". An interactive graph for the series can be found [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLH0A2HYB). Below are the notes attached to the series:\n\n> This data represents the Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) of the ICE BofA US Corporate B Index, a subset of the ICE BofA US High Yield Master II Index tracking the performance of US dollar denominated below investment grade rated corporate debt publicly issued in the US domestic market. This subset includes all securities with a given investment grade rating B.\n> The ICE BofA OASs are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n> \n> Certain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.
