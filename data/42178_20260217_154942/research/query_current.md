Analysis:
To project the daily option-adjusted spread of the Single-B segment of U.S. high-yield bonds on 25 Feb 2026, I need the latest commentary, forecasts, and drivers of U.S. junk-bond risk premiums. Relevant information will likely discuss: 1) current levels and recent trend of the BAMLH0A2HYB series, 2) credit-market reactions to February 2026 macro data (CPI, PPI, retail sales), 3) expectations for the March 2026 FOMC decision, 4) recession/soft-landing probabilities, 5) primary-market issuance, and 6) corporate default outlooks from ratings agencies and strategists. News and analyst notes published within the past few days are most useful, as this is a fast-moving, daily series.
