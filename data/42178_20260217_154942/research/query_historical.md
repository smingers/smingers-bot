Analysis:
To forecast the 2026-02-25 value we first need an outside view: (a) the long-run distribution of the ICE BofA Single-B HY OAS, (b) its behavior around recent macro events, and (c) the short-term trend over the last few weeks.  Historical daily figures from FRED plus commentary from market and news sources are most relevant.  Therefore we’ll look for: 1) a direct download or chart of the BAMLH0A2HYB series, 2) recent news articles discussing movements in single-B high-yield spreads, and 3) a narrative synthesis of the latest data and macro backdrop (Fed policy expectations, recession probabilities, credit conditions).  These items will let us quantify typical day-to-day volatility and anchor a probabilistic forecast for 2026-02-25.
