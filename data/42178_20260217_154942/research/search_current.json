further passthrough expected in 2026 but upward pressure on goods prices inflation should fade as year progresses\n- Inflation expectations are well anchored, wage growth has converged to target-consistent levels\n\n**Europe:**\n- Upside and downside risks to growth are finely balanced\n- Short-term risks: US trade tensions, Chinese competition, domestic political uncertainty\n- Potential catalysts: increased fiscal spending, tourism, AI spending\n- Headline inflation expected to remain below 2% target for next two years\n\n**UK:**\n- Combination of risks point to downside given subdued sentiment and ongoing labor market weakness\n- Recent GDP figures came in well under Bank of England projections\n- Inflation will take a big step down in 2026 due to cost-of-living measures, easing wage pressures\n\n**China:**\n- Exports expected to continue growing solidly in 2026 as important growth engine against soft domestic demand\n\n**Japan:**\n- Underlying inflation pressures remain strong\n- Tight labor market and weak yen could continue supporting price increases\n\n## Central Bank Policy Views\n\n**Federal Reserve:**\n- Currently on pause, waiting for change in balance of risks between inflation and employment\n- FOMC's dovish core shows sensitivity to labor market weakness, suggesting low bar to further cuts\n- New Fed Governor arriving in May likely to adopt dovish stance, increasing case for further easing in 2026\n- Timing of potential cuts remains unclear\n\n**ECB:**\n- Firmly on hold with high bar for both easing and tightening\n- Recent projection upgrades suggest risk of inflation surprising to downside\n- Growth would need to significantly weaken for cuts to come into play\n\n**Bank of England:**\n- Expected to continue cutting rates to neutral given lower inflation\n- Downside surprises to growth could see rates cut further\n\n**Bank of Japan:**\n- On course to hike twice in 2026\n- Timing depends on wage negotiations and yen direction\n\n**Other Central Banks:**\n- Sweden (Riksbank): likely on hold for 2026, may start hiking in Q1 2027\n- Swiss National Bank: likely to keep rates at zero in 2026\n- Norway (Norges Bank): on course for two cuts in 2026\n- Canada: may keep rates steady for 2026\n- Australia and New Zealand: rates look set to be steady, but could be among first DM central banks to pivot back to rate hikes given above-target inflation and cyclical recovery\n\n## Investment Opportunities (Goldman Sachs' Views)\n\n**Fixed Income:**\n- Neutral on US Treasuries and European bonds, but hold steepening bias across both\n- US steepeners could benefit in either risk-off (labor market weakness) or risk-on (fiscal expansion) scenarios\n- Europe steepeners could benefit from selling by Dutch pension funds transitioning schemes\n- Japan: positioned underweight and in curve flatteners due to continued rate hikes\n- UK: overweight duration with focus on short end due to weak labor market and falling inflation\n- Australia and New Zealand: positioned overweight, believing market overestimates probability of pivot to rate hikes\n\n**Currency:**\n- Balanced view on US dollar given pressures in both directions\n- Chair Powell's December comments suggested low tolerance for labor market weakness, implying dollar could fall if unemployment/payroll data disappoints\n- Stronger readings could support greenback, as could AI-related capex\n- Cautious on British pound given fiscal concerns\n- Cautious on Japanese yen given potential for increased government spending under Takaichi premiership\n- Select overweight positions in emerging markets: South Korean won, Mexican peso, Czech koruna\n\n**Note:** This document represents Goldman Sachs Asset Management's outlook and investment positioning as of Q1 2026.

The stock, trading at $26.23, is near its 52-week high of $27.21 and has delivered a 40.3% year-to-date return.

Nineteen percent of respondents expect gold to rise above $7,000, while 20 percent believe it has already reached its peak. The 'long gold' position\u2014investments made in anticipation of rising gold prices\u2014was the most crowded trade for the second consecutive month, with 50 percent of participants holding this view. Gold's strong appeal is reflected in portfolio allocations: net overweight in equities reached 48 percent, the highest level since December 2024, while net underweight in bonds fell to 40 percent, the lowest since September 2022. Investors expect long-term bond yields to rise (57 percent) and short-term yields to fall (46 percent). The combined weight of equities and commodities reached a net 76 percent, the highest since January 2022. Investors increased exposure to emerging markets (net +49 percent) and Eurozone equities (net +35 percent), while reducing exposure to U.S. equities (net -22 percent). Demand for energy, basic materials, and consumer staples rose in February, while outflows were observed from U.S. equities, technology, and dollar-denominated assets. Risk indicators are also notable: the BofA Bull & Bear Indicator rose to 9.5, entering the 'sell' zone, signaling a reversal. Twenty-five percent of respondents identified the 'AI bubble' as their top tail risk, while 43 percent cited private equity and private credit markets as potential sources of a systemic credit crisis. The survey reflects a dual investor stance: increasing allocation to gold and riskier assets, while maintaining caution toward potential bubbles and credit risks. The $6,200 average peak forecast and the $7,000 scenario remain central to market expectations.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 01:26 PM\nSource:[S\u00f6zc\u00fc Gazetesi](https://www.sozcu.com.tr/abd-li-bankadan-carpici-anket-altin-icin-dengeleri-altust-edecek-tahmin-p294773)\n\n**US 10-Year Treasury Yield Continues to Trade Near 'Fair Value' | Investing.com**\nThe U.S. 10-year Treasury yield traded near its 'fair value' in January 2026, according to three models from CapitalSpectator.com, marking a continuation of a five-month trend of near-neutral pricing. The market rate premium over fair value was 25 basis points in January\u2014up slightly from December and the highest in five months\u2014but remained close to fair value, indicating a recent convergence between market rates and theoretical estimates. Historically, deviations from fair value have shown quasi-random behavior around zero, suggesting mean reversion when spreads widen significantly. This pattern was evident in October 2023, when the spread reached a 95th percentile level since 1980, signaling a peak. More than two years later, the spread has narrowed sharply due to a rising fair-value estimate and a decline in the 10-year yield, which closed at 4.04% on February 13, 2026\u2014nearly one percentage point below the 5% peak observed in October 2023.

Equity markets performed well during the quarter despite volatility, supported by strong corporate earnings and two additional U.S. Federal Reserve rate cuts. AI-linked stocks began to show momentum. The Fed's rate cuts lowered interest rates, tightened high yield spreads by 8 basis points, and improved convertible bond valuations\u2014particularly for volatility-sensitive and in-the-money bonds. Elevated capital demands in AI, software, and technology sectors, combined with mature asset class profiles, are expected to sustain strong new issue activity into 2026. IREN Ltd. and Bloom Energy were the top contributors due to bond exchanges and underlying stock appreciation, while Exact Sciences and Liberty Interactive detracted due to acquisition-related terms and consumer credit weakness.

The ICE BofA Corporate Option-Adjusted Spread, a key indicator of credit market stress, remains compressed despite elevated US debt ($38.5 trillion as of January) and a 10-year Treasury yield of 4.28%, suggesting that risk is underpriced. Historically, Bitcoin has formed local bottoms three to six months after credit spreads begin to widen, as seen in 2018, 2020, and 2022. Analyst Joao Wedson of Alphractal predicted in August 2025 that a tightening of liquidity and rising credit spreads could trigger a new Bitcoin accumulation phase. Recent data shows increased short-term selling: large holders (whales) and mid-term holders moved approximately 5,000 BTC to Binance, mirroring a similar spike in December. The spent output profit ratio (SOPR), a metric tracking seller behavior, dropped to 1\u2014the lowest level in a year\u2014indicating long-term seller exhaustion. With Treasury yields expected to pressure credit markets and spreads potentially rising to 1.5\u20132% by April 2026, an accumulation window may emerge between May and July 2026, aligning with historical patterns.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 09:24 PM\nSource:[Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/next-bitcoin-accumulation-phase-may-hinge-on-credit-stress-timing-data)\n\n**RBB Fund, Inc. - US Treasury 6 Month Bill ETF (NYSEARCA:XBIL) Hits New 12-Month High - Here's What Happened**\nThe RBB Fund, Inc. - US Treasury 6 Month Bill ETF (NYSEARCA:XBIL) reached a new 52-week high on Friday, trading as high as $50.21 and closing at $50.21, with 88,455 shares traded.

Despite rising investor interest due to declining investment-grade bond yields\u2014down from over 4.1% to below 2.75% for Canadian 5-year bonds and similarly reduced US Treasury yields\u2014junk bonds are not providing sufficient yield premium relative to their elevated credit risk. The ICE BofA US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread, a key measure of excess return over risk-free Treasuries, indicates a minimal yield advantage. At present, the spread is not compelling, suggesting that investors are not being adequately rewarded for the added risk. The current US speculative-grade bond default rate is 4.6%, elevated compared to 2022\u2019s sub-2% lows, though below historic peaks during the financial crisis (over 12%) and Covid (nearly 7%). Rowat cautions that weak economic data in 2026 could further erode the perceived value of junk bonds, as recessions typically increase default rates. He compares investing in junk bonds to placing a parlay bet\u2014tempting due to high yields but unjustified by the underlying risk. Alternative strategies for improving portfolio yield include equity exposure (e.g., S&P/TSX Composite, FTSE 100) and preferred shares, which offer higher yields with lower default risk due to stable, blue-chip issuers. Rowat concludes that, at this time, the junk bond market resembles a 'bad parlay bet' where the reward does not justify the risk.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 06, 2025 01:23 PM\nSource:[greaterfool.ca](https://www.greaterfool.ca/2025/12/06/got-junk/)\n\n**US corporate credit spreads widen as equities market falls By Reuters**\nU.S. corporate credit spreads widened on November 18, 2025, as the stock market closed below the 50-day moving average for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq for the first time since April 30, 2025. According to the ICE BofA U.S. High Yield Index, the average option-adjusted spread on U.S. high-yield corporate credit widened by six basis points from Friday to Monday. Investment-grade corporate credit spreads also increased, rising from 83 bps to 84 bps on the ICE BofA U.S. Corporate Index. The move followed a broader decline in global equities, driven by investor concerns over a weakening U.S. economy and a potential artificial intelligence (AI) market bubble. A portfolio manager for high-yield corporate bonds, speaking anonymously, noted that while the theme of economic fragility is gaining attention, 'I don't see it blowing up in the high-yield or even investment-grade bond market - it's never going to be big enough to cause pain for people.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 04:07 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-corporate-credit-spreads-widen-as-equities-market-falls-4365678)\n\n**Stocks Week Ahead: Credit Markets, Private Equity Bets Flash Warning Signs | Investing.com India**\nInvestors are advised to monitor this week's U.S. Treasury auctions for signs of weak demand, which could push the 10-year yield above 4.15% and reverse its recent downtrend. A break above 4.15% would signal renewed upward pressure on yields, especially given the recent decline since mid-July. The U.S. Dollar Index is showing bullish divergence on the RSI, with a potential double-bottom pattern forming, but confirmation requires a move above 99. The USD/JPY may weaken initially post-Japan elections, as newly probable PM Sanae Takaichi is seen as a fiscal dove and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Shinzo Abe, potentially limiting yen strength despite narrowing U.S.-Japan spread. Credit spreads are beginning to widen, particularly in Italy and Germany, with Italian 10-year yields showing a possible inverse head and shoulders pattern, while U.S. high-yield spreads (ICE BofA Option-Adjusted Spread) are rising\u2014suggesting market concerns over a weakening labor market. This credit deterioration may already be reflected in the stock declines of Blackstone (NYSE:BX), Apollo (NYSE:APO), and Meta (NASDAQ:META), signaling that investors are pricing in a future credit downturn, even as AI-driven spending continues. Despite this, stock prices have not yet fully reacted to widening spreads.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 07:12 AM\nSource:[Investing.com India](https://in.investing.com/analysis/stocks-week-ahead-credit-markets-private-equity-bets-flash-warning-signs-200631460)\n\n**Stocks Week Ahead: Credit Markets, Private Equity Bets Flash Warning Signs | Investing.com**\nThe week ahead in financial markets is expected to be light on economic data due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, but Treasury auctions for 3-year, 10-year, and 30-year bonds will proceed. The 10-year Treasury yield, which has been declining since mid-July, may reverse its trend if it breaks above 4.15%, signaling renewed upward pressure. Weak demand in Treasury auctions could confirm this shift. The U.S. Dollar Index shows a bullish divergence on the RSI, suggesting a potential double bottom, though a breakout above 99 is needed to confirm a stronger bullish outlook. The USD/JPY may weaken as Japan\u2019s likely new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi\u2014seen as a fiscal dove and protege of Shinzo Abe\u2014may lead to lower yen strength despite narrowing U.S.-Japan yield spreads. Meanwhile, Italian and German credit spreads have begun to widen slightly, breaking from historically tight levels, which could signal broader global spread increases. While French and German yields are rising, Italian 10-year yields have remained flat, though a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern suggests they may rise soon. In the U.S., the ICE BofA High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread is increasing, possibly reflecting early market concerns about a weakening labor market. Credit spreads are critical because they directly influence stock valuations; even modest widening has not yet impacted stock prices. The recent declines in stocks like Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Apollo (NYSE:APO) may reflect early market pricing of deteriorating credit quality. This could suggest that excessive AI spending may eventually lead to financial strain, particularly for high-spending firms\u2014though Meta (NASDAQ:META) remains a variable to watch.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 07:08 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-week-ahead-credit-markets-private-equity-bets-flash-warning-signs-200667979)\n\n**US Treasury 6 Month Bill ETF $XBIL Shares Sold by Alpine Bank Wealth Management - Transcript Daily**\nThe US Treasury 6\u2011Month Bill ETF (ticker XBIL) experienced several institutional adjustments in the first quarter of 2025.
