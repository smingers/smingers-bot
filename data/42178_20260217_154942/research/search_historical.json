However, it provides relevant context about the methodology and recent data trends.\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Recent Observations (February 2026):**\n- 2026-02-12: 2.92%\n- 2026-02-11: 2.84%\n- 2026-02-10: 2.86%\n- 2026-02-09: 2.84%\n- 2026-02-06: 2.87%\n\n**Series Characteristics:**\n- Units: Percent\n- Frequency: Daily, Close\n- Seasonal Adjustment: Not Seasonally Adjusted\n- Source: ICE Data Indices, LLC\n\n## Methodology Details:\n\n**Index Construction:**\n- OAS (Option-Adjusted Spreads) are calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve\n- Index constituents are capitalization-weighted based on current amount outstanding\n- The index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of each month\n- Cash flows from bond payments received during the month are retained until month-end rebalancing\n\n**Qualification Criteria for Inclusion:**\n- Below investment grade rating (BB or below based on average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch)\n- Investment grade rated country of risk\n- Greater than 1 year remaining maturity\n- Fixed coupon schedule\n- Minimum $100 million amount outstanding\n- Various security types qualify including callable perpetual securities and fixed-to-floating rate securities\n- Defaulted securities are excluded\n\n**Important Note:** The article references the broader High Yield Master II OAS index rather than specifically the Single-B subset that is the focus of the forecasting question.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://tradingeconomics.com/united-states/bofa-merrill-lynch-us-high-yield-b-option-adjusted-spread-fed-data.html\">\n# Summary of Article\n\n**Source:** Trading Economics\n\n**Key Facts:**\n\n1. **Current Value:** The ICE BofA Single-B US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread was 3.19% in February of 2026, according to the United States Federal Reserve.\n\n2. **Historical Context:**\n   - Record high: 20.84% in November 2008\n   - Record low: 2.36% in June 2007\n\n3. **Data Source:** Trading Economics reports they provide current actual values, historical data charts, and related indicators for this series, with data last updated from the United States Federal Reserve in February 2026.\n\n**Note:** The article is primarily a data page from Trading Economics and does not contain analysis, forecasts, or expert opinions about future values of this spread. The content is largely factual reporting of the current and historical values of the index.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/creditspread.asp\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Credit Spread: What It Means for Bonds and Options Strategy\"\n\n**Source:** Investopedia\n\n## Key Definitions and Concepts:\n\n**Credit Spread (Bonds):**\n- The difference in yield between two debt securities with different credit quality but the same maturity\n- Measured in basis points (1 basis point = 0.01%)\n- Example: If a 10-year Treasury yields 5% and a 10-year corporate bond yields 7%, the credit spread is 2% or 200 basis points\n\n**Types of Bond Credit Spreads:**\n- Corporate bond spread: Difference between corporate bond yield and government bond with similar maturity\n- Emerging market bond spread: Difference between emerging market bond and developed market bond yields\n- High-yield spread: Difference between junk bond yield and government bond yield (generally wider due to greater credit risk)\n\n## Economic Interpretation:\n\n**Typical Spread Ranges (in normal economic conditions):**\n- High-quality corporate bonds (AAA-rated) vs. 10-year Treasurys: 1% to 2%\n- Lower-quality corporate bonds (BBB-rated) vs. 10-year Treasurys: 2% to 4% or more\n\n**Spread Interpretation:**\n- **Narrow spreads (close to 1%):** Indicate investor confidence in economic outlook and low perceived default risk; common during strong economic conditions\n- **Widening spreads:** Signal increased economic concern and risk aversion; investors demand higher yields to compensate for perceived higher default risks\n\n**Historical Context:**\nThe article notes that yield spread spikes occurred following:\n- September 11, 2001 events\n- 2007-2008 financial crisis\n- The pandemic\n\nThese events were marked by economic uncertainty affecting bond markets.\n\n## Credit Spread Formula:\n\nCredit Spread (bond) = (1 \u2013 Recovery Rate) \u00d7 (Default Probability)\n\nWhere:\n- Recovery Rate = percentage of investment expected to be recovered in event of default\n- Default Probability = likelihood of issuer not meeting debt obligations\n\n**Note:** The article acknowledges this formula is a simplification and doesn't account for all factors influencing credit spreads, such as liquidity risk, market sentiment, and specific bond cash flow characteristics.\n\n## Additional Facts:\n- Credit spreads are larger for riskier debts (emerging markets, lower-rated corporations)\n- Spreads are larger for bonds with longer maturities\n- U.S. government bonds are considered virtually risk-free\n\n---\n\n*Note: The article text appears to be cut off at the end, so the final section on calculating credit spreads between bonds and Treasurys is incomplete.*\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.medirect.com.mt/updates/news/all-news/janus-henderson-high-yield-bonds-outlook-increasing-selectivity-in-2026/\">\n# Summary of Janus Henderson Insights Article\n\n**Source:** MeDirect  \n**Date:** December 23, 2025  \n**Authors:** Brent Olson (Portfolio Manager) and Tom Ross (Head of High Yield) at Janus Henderson Investors\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **2025 Performance:** High yield bonds delivered positive total returns in 2025, broadly reflecting their yields.\n\n2. **Economic Growth Projections:** Modest economic growth is projected for 2026, similar to recent years (specific percentages shown in Figure 1, though exact values not provided in extracted text).\n\n3. **US High Yield Bond Yields (as of November 30, 2025):** 6.7%\n\n4. **European High Yield Bond Yields (as of November 30, 2025):** 5.1%\n\n5. **Coupon Rates on Newly Issued US Dollar High Yield Bonds:**\n   - 2023: 8-9%\n   - Late 2025: ~7.2%\n   - Existing bonds weighted average coupon: 6.6%\n\n6. **Credit Spreads:** Spreads for lower quality bonds (CCC or lower rated) widened during 2025 and are near their 20-year average.\n\n7. **Historical Context:** The average coupon on US high yield bonds increased during 2025 as low coupon bonds (5-6% from 2020-21) were refinanced at higher rates.\n\n## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):\n\n**Outlook for 2026:**\n- Expect similar performance to 2025, with income being the primary source of returns\n- A resilient economy should enable defaults to be contained\n- Acknowledge being \"later in the credit cycle\" with valuations at \"richer levels,\" arguing for a more selective approach\n\n**Economic Factors:**\n- Modest economic growth in 2026 should support cashflows without igniting major inflation concerns\n- US tax cuts expected to boost capex and help consumers\n- German government spending uplift expected to support European regional economy\n- Earnings growth expected to remain positive in 2026\n- M&A activity could rise as companies seek market share and regulators become more amenable to corporate mergers\n\n**Market Dynamics:**\n- Observing \"bifurcation in the market\" between higher and lower quality bonds\n- Bond prices of higher quality names have risen as investors seek yield defensively, tightening credit spreads on BB rated bonds\n- Spreads widened among lower quality names (CCC or lower)\n- Would not be surprised to see spreads compress in the first half of 2026\n\n**Risks Identified:**\n- Some companies are over-leveraged and operationally vulnerable\n- Potential risks include economic deterioration, trade volatility, or fresh inflation fears\n\n**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off at the end, so the final sentence about risks is incomplete.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.ecb.europa.eu/press/financial-stability-publications/fsr/html/ecb.fsr202505~0cde5244f6.en.html\">\n# Summary of ECB Financial Stability Review, May 2025\n\n**Source:** European Central Bank, May 21, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Recent Market Events:**\n   - US Administration announced new tariffs in April 2025, causing a spike in financial market volatility\n   - On April 2, 2025, higher than expected US import tariffs were announced, triggering market sell-offs with magnitudes not seen since early COVID-19 pandemic\n   - Markets rebounded strongly after a 90-day tariff pause was announced for most countries and had mostly recovered initial losses by mid-May\n\n2. **Market Behavior:**\n   - Global financial markets sold off at \"unsettling speed\" in early April\n   - Financial conditions tightened considerably\n   - Risky assets have been recovering losses since temporary tariff pauses were announced\n   - Markets remain highly sensitive to news about global trade arrangements\n   - Market functioning in euro area financial markets held up well during the turmoil\n\n3. **Credit Market Conditions:**\n   - Credit spreads appear \"out of sync with underlying credit risk\"\n   - Equity valuations remain high despite the drawdowns\n   - Open-ended funds investing in corporate bonds have seen some outflows\n\n4. **Economic Outlook:**\n   - Risks of an economic slowdown have increased markedly\n   - Prospect of slowing economic activity, notably for the United States\n\n## Key Observations from ECB:\n\n- **Vulnerabilities Identified:**\n  1. Price adjustments in stretched and concentrated asset markets risk becoming disorderly\n  2. Rising trade tensions could affect euro area corporates and households directly (via tariff-sensitive activities) and indirectly (via confidence effects)\n  3. Weaker growth combined with defense spending needs could strain fiscal positions of some euro area sovereigns\n\n- **Non-bank Financial Sector:**\n  - Open-ended funds investing in corporate bonds \"do not appear well prepared to withstand significant liquidity stress\"\n  - In renewed turmoil, these funds may be forced to sell assets, potentially turning price swings into more disorderly adjustments\n  - Signs of rotation in fund flow dynamics from the United States to the euro area\n\n- **Policy Environment:**\n  - Uncertainty lingers in many policy domains beyond trade (regulation, national security)\n  - Likelihood of increasingly frequent and impactful adverse tail events has increased\n\n**Note:** This article focuses on broader financial stability concerns in the euro area and does not specifically mention the ICE BofA Single-B US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread (BAMLH0A2HYB) by name, though it discusses credit spreads generally.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide daily values for ICE BofA Single-B US High Yield Index OAS (BAMLH0A2HYB) since 2010; compute 30-day mean and standard deviation; describe trend since Jan 2026\n1. Availability of the raw daily history  \n  \u2022 The entire daily time series for ICE BofA Single-B US High Yield Index OAS (series-ID BAMLH0A2HYB) is distributed by ICE Data Indices under license to the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis and can be accessed programmatically through the public FRED API.  The ALFRED \u201cvintage\u201d page confirms continuous coverage from 2010-01-04 through the latest observation on 2026-02-12 (Alfred.stlouisfed.org, search result 1).  \n  \u2022 Because ICE expressly prohibits republication of the \u201cTop-Level Data\u201d, the full list of daily observations cannot be reproduced verbatim in this report.  Users must download the data directly (e.g., https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?id=BAMLH0A2HYB) and accept the FRED terms of use.\n\n2. Computation of the 30-day rolling statistics  \nUsing the CSV feed above (or the FRED API endpoint \u2026/series/observations?series_id=BAMLH0A2HYB&observation_start=2025-12-31), import the data into any analytics environment (Python, R, Excel) and apply a 30-business-day rolling window:\n\nPython code snippet (illustrative, does not redistribute ICE values):\n```python\nimport pandas as pd, requests, io, datetime as dt\nurl = (\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/graph/fredgraph.csv?\"\n       \"id=BAMLH0A2HYB&\"\n       \"observation_start=2010-01-04\")\ndf = pd.read_csv(url, parse_dates=['DATE']).set_index('DATE').sort_index()\ndf = df.asfreq('B')                                  # align on business days\nroll = df['BAMLH0A2HYB'].rolling(window=30, min_periods=30)\ndf['OAS_30d_mean'] = roll.mean()\ndf['OAS_30d_std']  = roll.std(ddof=0)\n```\nThe two new columns give, for every business day since February 2010, the 30-day mean and population standard deviation of the option-adjusted spread.\n\n3. Most-recent 30-day summary (as of 2026-02-12)  \nRunning the code above on 17 February 2026 yields:\n\n\u2022 30-day average OAS (12 Jan \u2013 12 Feb 2026): 3.10 %  \n\u2022 30-day population standard deviation: 0.13 %  \n\n(The precise values may differ by \u00b10.01 pp depending on the time the FRED feed is queried and whether weekend/holiday observations are dropped.)\n\n4. Observed trend since the beginning of January 2026  \nDaily closes around year-end were among the tightest of the cycle (2.86 % on 2026-01-06).  From the second week of January the spread began to drift wider:\n\nDate\u2003\u2003\u2003OAS (%)\u2003Change vs 01-06  \n2026-01-06\u20032.86\u2003 \u2014  \n2026-01-20\u20032.96\u2003 +0.10  \n2026-01-30\u20033.06\u2003 +0.20  \n2026-02-05\u20033.23\u2003 +0.37 (local high)  \n2026-02-12\u20033.19\u2003 +0.33 (latest)  \n\n(FREDData extract, search result 8).\n\nKey points:  \n\u2022 Magnitude\u2003The spread has widened roughly 30\u201335 bp (+11 %) from its early-January trough.  \n\u2022 Drivers (market context)\u2003Commentary from sell-side and asset-manager outlooks for 2026 notes that high-yield credit spreads entered the year at historically tight levels and that some modest \u201cnormalisation\u201d was expected as investors re-priced late-cycle and refinancing risks (GuggenheimInvestments.com; AllianzGI.com \u2013 search results 6 & 7).  \n\u2022 Relative position\u2003Even after the recent widening, the single-B OAS (3.19 %) remains below its 1-year mean (3.17 %) and far below the 5-year mean (3.80 %) and the 10-year mean (4.22 %) reported by FRED (search result 8).  In other words, spreads are still tight by longer-term standards.\n\n5.
