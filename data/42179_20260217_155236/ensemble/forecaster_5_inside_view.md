Analysis:

1. Source analysis (chronological and graded for reliability)

• Take-Two earnings call, 3 Feb 2026 – primary corporate disclosure; reconfirms 19 Nov 2026 launch. Very reliable, fresh (✭✭✭✭).

• Sunday Guardian 7 Feb 2026 – paraphrases the above call; mixes facts with speculation about price/PC. Factual parts reliable (✭✭✭).

• La Razón / IGN Italia / ZOL 17 Feb 2026 – same-day TV interview with CEO Strauss Zelnick reiterating “no further delay” and summer marketing ramp-up. First-hand quotes, highly reliable (✭✭✭✭).

• GameRevolution 12 Feb 2026 – analyst note predicting Trailer-2 in Aug 2026; secondary but sound (✭✭✭).

• Misc. pieces on leak takedowns, “free-baby” promotion, server-overload jokes (15-16 Feb 2026) – hype only, negligible factual weight (✭).

All sources concern the underlying game rather than Metaculus dynamics; the CEO interview is the only genuinely new, bullish fact since the current 65 % snapshot.

2. Evidence analysis (relevance to whether CP nudges above 65 %)

Strong evidence
• CEO on 17 Feb publicly and unambiguously states the date is “firm” – removes short-term delay rumours.

Moderate evidence
• February earnings call already baked in; still positive.
• Reference-class data: with 11 days left, 0.9 pp daily σ ⇒ ~3 pp one-sigma band – just enough to hop over the line.

Weak evidence
• Viral marketing stunts, community memes, leak takedowns – drive chatter but historically move Metaculus CP <0.3 pp.

Net: one new strong, game-positive signal; otherwise symmetric random walk.

3. Timeframe analysis
• Resolution in 11.0 days.
If window were halved to 5 days, historic σ would drop to ~2 pp and I’d cut the chance of a move to 53 → 51 %.
If doubled to 22 days (σ ≈ 4.2 pp), probability would rise to ~58 %.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view base-rate (symmetry at threshold, ties = No) …………… 50 %
Historical slight upward bias (>0 finishes) ………………………………… +2 pp
CEO reassurance likely to push sentiment +0.4–0.8 pp ……………… +3 pp
Expected one-sigma volatility already counted; no fresh negatives ……   0 pp
Inside-view probability ……………………………………………………………… 55 %

5. How the forecast could fail
A credible leak or analyst note hinting at a slip to 2027 in the next week could shave ≥2 pp off CP, leaving it ≤65 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that in 55 out of 100 comparable situations the community prediction will be strictly above 65.00 % at the timestamp.”

Checklist:

1. Title paraphrase – “Will Metaculus CP for ‘GTA VI released in 2026’ exceed 65 % on 28 Feb 2026?”

2. Outside-view base = 50 %, incrementally adjusted.

3. Consistency check: 55/100 paths end above the line – plausible given symmetric drift plus slight positive news.

4. Key evidence (short):
   a) 17 Feb CEO ‘firm date’ quote.
   b) Current CP sits exactly on threshold; 1 tick up is Yes.
   c) 11-day historical σ ≈ 3 pp.
   d) No announcements scheduled before 28 Feb that plausibly introduce bad news.

5. Blind spot: sudden rumour of internal delay leaks.

6. Status-quo pull: community forecasts usually drift ≤ ±2 pp in 11 days; tie favours No, hence only modest edge toward Yes.

Probability: 55%
