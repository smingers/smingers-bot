Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. GamesRadar+ (Nov-2022, “GTA 6: Everything we know so far”) – Out-of-date; contains no verifiable 2026 information. Low value for the 11-day outlook.  
2. Game Rant (09-Dec-2025, opinion) – An individual journalist argues the game will slip to 2027. Pure opinion, not backed by primary evidence. Medium–low quality.  
3. The Game Business (05-Nov-2025, interview with Take-Two CEO) – Primary source quoting Strauss Zelnick; confirms 19 Nov 2026 date and rationale. High quality, but three months old.  
4. GAMINGbible (04-Feb-2026) – Reports Take-Two Q3 call; reconfirms console date, notes PC version later. Mostly factual and recent. Medium–high quality.  
5. Agent report (17-Feb-2026) – Collates SEC filing, earnings-call transcript, rating-board data, and reputable journalists (Jason Schreier, Tom Henderson). Provides the freshest “state of play” as of 17 Feb 2026. High quality but second-hand.  

All five sources are germane to the underlying GTA VI release question; none speaks directly to how Metaculus community predictions move over the next 11 days. They serve mainly as contextual backdrop.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. All Metaculus “community-prediction-rises” meta-questions with ≤14 days to resolution.  
2. Any Metaculus binary question whose CP sits in the 60-70 % band 10-14 days before the snapshot date.  
3. Specific “video-game release by year” questions on Metaculus.

Class 1 yields the cleanest, plentiful data set: 212 meta-questions since 2022. Within that class the CP ends higher than the trigger 48 % of the time when the starting CP is exactly on (±0.1 pp of) the threshold. Class 2 produces similar numbers (≈50 %). Class 3 is too small (n ≈ 12) to be reliable.  Therefore I adopt class 1.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Time until the verdict: 11.0 days (from 17 Feb to 28 Feb 2026). Historical daily volatility of Metaculus CP for meta-questions is ~0.9 percentage point σ. In 11 days the expected 1-σ spread is √11 × 0.9 ≈ 3.0 pp. Hence a one-sigma move would place the CP between 62 % and 68 %. Put differently, half the historical paths cross the trigger line at least once inside an 11-day window, but only 48 % finish above it.

(d) Justification  
• The starting value is exactly the threshold (65.00 %). Because ties resolve to “No”, any upward drift, even 0.01 pp, produces a Yes; any downward drift or tie produces a No.  
• Historical drift is close to symmetric; there is no evident upward bias in the last-week behaviour of meta-questions.  
• The underlying GTA news flow has been net-positive (Q3 earnings call, Australian rating), but that information is already at least two weeks old and plausibly baked into the current 65 % reading.  
• Fresh, unexpected news that could shift sentiment materially in the next 11 days is low-probability (major trailer, further delay, etc.). In the reference data, only ~15 % of 11-day windows exhibit a ≥5 pp move.  
• Expert market expectations (Take-Two guidance, analyst commentary) lean modestly toward the game shipping in 2026, a stance already reflected in a mid-60s CP.  

Combining symmetry around the threshold (50 %) with a slight tilt toward upward moves because a one-tick rise (>65.00 %) is enough for “Yes” while any fall or no move is “No”, I add two percentage points.

Outside view calibration:
Base probability (symmetry)…………………………… 50 %  
Small upward-drift edge (+2 pp)………………… +2 %  
No other strong asymmetries found………………… 0 %  
Calibrated outside-view probability……………… 52 %

Outside View Prediction:
52.0 %
