> This question will resolve based upon a release anywhere in the world and on any platform, so long as the release is for the general public.
> 
> Unofficial leaks, early access to selected individuals, or select physical locations where a preview may be played will not qualify.

Original background: 
> [Grand Theft Auto VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_VI) (GTA VI) is an upcoming action-adventure game developed and published by [Rockstar Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Games). It's predecessor [GTA V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V) is the second best selling video game of all time with an estimated [220 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games) copies sold.
> 
> Currently scheduled to be released on [19 November 2026](https://www.gamesradar.com/gta-6-guide/), the game has been repeatedly delayed with initial expectations of a 2024 released missed with a [2025 release date](https://www.pcgamesn.com/grand-theft-auto-vi/gta-6-release-date-setting-map-characters-gameplay-trailers). The game was then delayed to [May 2026](https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026), before again being delayed to [November 2026](https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026).

# Article Summary: "GTA 6 ain't releasing in 2026. If Rockstar somehow pulls that off, I'll eat my hat."

**Source:** Game Rant  
**Date:** December 09, 2025

## Key Points:

### Author's Main Argument:
The author (Joshua) strongly believes GTA 6 will not release in 2026, predicting it will come out in 2027 at the earliest.

### Development Timeline Facts:
- **GTA 5** released in 2013
- **Red Dead 2** released in 2018
- According to available information cited by the author:
  - Preliminary work on GTA 6 began in 2014
  - Early development began in 2018
  - Full development began sometime in 2020

### Comparison to Other Games:
- **Cyberpunk 2077** example: First teaser trailer in January 2013, released in 2020, but full development didn't start until late 2016 (despite public perception of longer development time)

### Recent Delay History:
- **August 2025:** Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick stated his "level of conviction is very, very high" regarding May 2026 release date
- **A few months later:** Game was delayed from May 2026 to November 2026

### Red Flags Cited by Author:
1. **No gameplay shown:** Despite years since announcement and less than a year to alleged release date (as of article date), no gameplay has been revealed
2. **Industry behavior:** The gaming industry is planning around a 2026 release, similar to how November 2025 was "barren" in anticipation

### Recent Rumor Context:
- Reece 'Kiwi Talkz' Reilly recently stated that rumors of a 2027 delay are "unfounded"
- However, Reilly also said: "GTA 6 is still too far out to determine if another delay is needed yet"
- Author interprets this as meaning it's too early to know if another delay will occur, not as confirmation of the 2026 date

### Author's Reasoning:
- Development timelines have gotten longer in recent years
- Rockstar is reportedly moving away from crunch culture, which would extend development time
- Release date announcements are primarily for shareholders, not gamers
- The May 2026 date was maintained for "business reasons" before being delayed

**Note:** This is an opinion piece from a gaming journalist expressing skepticism about the official release date, not a report based on insider sources or leaks.

# Article Summary: Grand Theft Auto VI Delayed Again

**Key Facts:**

1. **New Release Date**: GTA VI will now launch on November 19, 2026
   - This represents another six-month delay from the previous date of May 26, 2026
   - The May 2026 date was itself a delay from Holiday 2025

2. **Official Statement from Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick**:
   - "When we set a date, we really do believe in it"
   - Explained the delay: "if a game requires more polish to be the best possible version of itself, then we will give that game more time"
   - "We feel really good about this release date"
   - "We feel quite good about this date" (repeated when asked about setting dates so far in advance)

3. **Reasoning for Advance Date Setting**:
   - Need to deliver game well before release
   - Marketing activities require significant lead time
   - Goal is to "give consumers as much certainty as possible"

4. **Context from Financial Results**:
   - Announced during Take-Two's Q2 financial results
   - Net bookings reached $1.96 billion (33% growth year-over-year)
   - The new release date remains in the same fiscal year as previously planned

5. **GTA Franchise Performance**:
   - GTA V has sold more than 220 million units
   - GTA Online continues to deliver better-than-expected results
   - GTA+ membership has grown 20% year-over-year

**Source Reliability**: This is a direct interview with Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick published by The Game Business, making it a highly reliable primary source for information about the game's release date and company perspective.

**Summary**:

Based on the limited content extracted:

**Article Metadata**:
- **Source**: GamesRadar+
- **Date**: November 04, 2022
- **Author**: Sam Loveridge (Brand Director, GamesRadar+)

**Content**:
The article is titled "GTA 6: Everything we know so far" and mentions that "GTA 6 is just months away, with the promo campaign kicking off this summer."

**Note**: The extracted content does not contain substantive information about GTA 6's release date, development status, or other relevant details that would be useful for forecasting. The majority of the extraction consists of author biographies and editorial roles rather than article content. The date of November 04, 2022 suggests this is an older article that predates the multiple delays mentioned in the background information (delays to May 2026 and November 2026).

# Summary of Article: "GTA 6 PC Launch Update Isn't What We Wanted To Hear"

**Source:** GAMINGbible  
**Date:** February 04, 2026

## Key Facts and Information:

1. **Console Release Confirmation:** Take-Two Interactive confirmed that GTA VI is still on track for its scheduled launch date of **November 19, 2026** for Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5.

2. **PC Port Status:** Take-Two made no mention of a PC version during their update, effectively confirming that the PC port is still in development and will not be available at launch. This aligns with Rockstar's initial announcement which only mentioned console platforms.

3. **Historical Precedent for PC Delays:**
   - **GTA V:** Console launch on September 17, 2013 (Xbox 360/PS3); PC release on April 14, 2015 - approximately 19 months later
   - **Red Dead Redemption 2:** Console launch on October 26, 2018 (Xbox One/PS4); PC release on November 5, 2019 - approximately 12 months later

4. **PC Release Prediction (Opinion - Article Author):** Based on historical patterns and the scale of GTA VI, the article suggests the PC port will likely launch "sometime in **November 2027 at the earliest**" - approximately 12 months after console release.

5. **Rationale for Delay (Opinion - Article Author):** The author suggests Rockstar will likely spend the first few months after console launch on bug fixing and enhancements before releasing the PC version, and that this approach will ultimately benefit the quality of the PC port.

**Note:** The article's PC release date prediction is speculative opinion from the author, not an official statement from Rockstar Games or Take-Two Interactive.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Summarize Feb 2026 reports, investor calls, leaks on GTA VI development status and likelihood of November 2026 launch; include any rating-board listings or marketing milestones.
1. Authoritative signals from Take-Two and Rockstar (February 2026)
   • Q3 FY-2026 earnings call – 3 Feb 2026  
     – Strauss Zelnick (CEO) “Major forthcoming title—Rockstar Games will launch Grand Theft Auto VI on 19 November [2026], with marketing starting in summer.” (Motley Fool transcript, 3 Feb 2026)  
     – Guidance for FY-2027 “record Net Bookings” is explicitly tied to the November launch, implying the date is baked into formal financial projections (Motley Fool, 3 Feb 2026).  
   • Press follow-ups to the call (IGN, PC Gamer, Outlook Respawn, 3-6 Feb 2026) all quote Zelnick saying he feels “very good” about the date and that confidence is now “as high as it can be” because marketing beats are being finalised (IGN, 3 Feb 2026; Outlook Respawn, 6 Feb 2026).  

   Taken together, publicly-traded Take-Two has locked its FY-2027 revenue outlook on GTA VI shipping in calendar Q4 2026 and has allowed multiple high-reach outlets to print the same message. That is the strongest hard evidence available.

2. Development-progress indicators
   • Confidence narrative: Reaffirmation after two previous slips, marketing plan in place, and no mention of contingency language in the 8-K filings accompanying the earnings release (Outlook Respawn, 6 Feb 2026).  
   • Caution narrative:  
     – Investigative reporter Jason Schreier said “last I heard it was still not content-complete” (PCGamesN round-up, updated 4 Feb 2026).  
     – Schreier nonetheless calls “fall 2026… more real” than prior windows, and leaker Tom Henderson says Rockstar is now “confident” (PCGamesN, 4 Feb 2026).  
     – Rockstar is not using generative AI for asset creation; scope control remains traditional (Daily Mirror, 4 Feb 2026). That rebuts rumours that AI tools are being relied on to finish faster but also implies the studio is still polishing by hand, which can over-run.  
   • Leaks/rumours: A January leak claims the physical (boxed) console edition may be held back by 3–4 weeks to cut spoiler risk (LADbible, 27 Jan 2026). If accurate, that suggests a digital release can be locked earlier than manufacturing lead-times, but also hints at tight schedules.  

3. Rating-board activity
   • Australia: The game received an MA 15+ classification on 15 Jun 2025, listing “Strong Violence, Strong Sexual References… Strong Coarse Language” (Gamingbible, 21 Dec 2025).  
     – Although lower than GTA V’s R18+ in Australia, outlets note the rating may be based on partial or outdated materials and could change later.  
   • No ESRB (North America) or PEGI (Europe) filings are yet public as of mid-Feb 2026. Absence is not unusual this far from launch but remains an information gap.  
   • Early 2023 “leak” of an Australian rating (Hindustan Times, 14 Oct 2023) is widely judged to have been a placeholder and is superseded by the June 2025 formal entry.  

   The existence of a real, dated rating-board record is an objective milestone: Rockstar is far enough along to submit a build to government censors. That tends to occur 12-18 months pre-launch for major titles, consistent with a November 2026 target.

4. Marketing milestones on record
   • “Launch marketing will begin this summer” (Take-Two earnings release; IGN, PC Gamer, 3 Feb 2026).  
   • Storefront presence: GTA VI is already wish-listable on PlayStation Store and Xbox Store with the 19 Nov 2026 console date (PCGamesN, 13 Nov 2025). No PC date is given, reinforcing that console release is the near-term focus.  
   • Trailers: Two cinematic trailers released (Dec 2024 and May 2025). No third trailer yet; press speculate it could accompany the summer marketing kick-off (Sunday Guardian, 16 Feb 2026).  

5. Counter-signals & noise
   • 16 Feb 2026 Sunday Guardian article claims “rumours” of another delay but provides no new sourcing beyond re-interpreting corporate wording (Sunday Guardian, 16 Feb 2026).  
   • Viral “gameplay/map” video on 16 Feb 2026 quickly debunked as AI fake (IXBT.games, 16 Feb 2026).  
   • These stories show the community’s hair-trigger reaction but supply no evidence strong enough to outweigh the audited corporate statements.

6. Synthesis: Likelihood of 19 November 2026 release
   Positive factors  
   • Date reaffirmed in SEC-regulated forum; bookings guidance depends on it.  
   • Rating-board submission already completed in at least one major jurisdiction.  
   • Marketing timeline locked; publisher willing to talk publicly about campaign structure.  
   • Insider sentiment (Henderson, York) now tilts toward belief that Rockstar will hit the window.  

   Remaining risks  
   • Schreier’s “not content-complete” comment indicates there is still a path to last-minute slip if unforeseen polish issues arise.  
   • Grand Theft Auto titles historically launch roughly four months after “content-complete” internal milestone; at mid-February 2026 the studio still has ~9 months.  
   • Absence of ESRB/PEGI filings and of a gameplay trailer leaves room for uncertainty.  

   Net assessment for forecasters (context: Metaculus community probability at 65 % on 16 Feb 2026 that GTA VI will release in 2026):  
   • Fresh, high-credibility corporate statements plus the Australian rating are material positive updates since the last community snapshot.  
   • No equally-credible negative development has emerged; rumours are unsubstantiated.  
   • Therefore, information available up to 17 Feb 2026 moderately increases the objective probability that GTA VI launches in 2026, nudging sentiment upward from the current 65 % baseline.  

Information gaps that remain
   • Public ESRB, PEGI, or other major-market ratings.  
   • Concrete evidence that the game has reached “content complete” status internally.  
   • Detailed marketing calendar (exact trailer 3 date, pre-order bonuses, etc.).  
   • Confirmation of whether physical console editions are delayed versus digital.  

These missing pieces could further firm up or erode confidence as the 28 Feb 2026 checkpoint approaches, but nothing disclosed so far contradicts Take-Two’s reiterated plan.</Agent_report>

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
