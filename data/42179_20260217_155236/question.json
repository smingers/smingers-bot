Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40965\n- Original question title: Will GTA VI be released during 2026?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 65.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> This question will resolve as **Yes** if Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA VI) is publicly released before January 1, 2027.\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> This question will resolve based upon a release anywhere in the world and on any platform, so long as the release is for the general public.\n> \n> Unofficial leaks, early access to selected individuals, or select physical locations where a preview may be played will not qualify.\n\nOriginal background: \n> [Grand Theft Auto VI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_VI) (GTA VI) is an upcoming action-adventure game developed and published by [Rockstar Games](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rockstar_Games). It's predecessor [GTA V](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grand_Theft_Auto_V) is the second best selling video game of all time with an estimated [220 million](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_video_games) copies sold.\n> \n> Currently scheduled to be released on [19 November 2026](https://www.gamesradar.com/gta-6-guide/), the game has been repeatedly delayed with initial expectations of a 2024 released missed with a [2025 release date](https://www.pcgamesn.com/grand-theft-auto-vi/gta-6-release-date-setting-map-characters-gameplay-trailers). The game was then delayed to [May 2026](https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026), before again being delayed to [November 2026](https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026).\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40965,\"question_id\":40673,\"last_cp\":0.65}}`",

If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-28 17:31:50 is higher than 65.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 65.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-28 17:31:50, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.",
