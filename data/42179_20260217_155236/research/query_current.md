Analysis:
To assess whether the Metaculus community prediction will rise above 65 % by 28 Feb 2026, I need very recent signals that could sway forecasters in either direction. The most influential drivers will be:  
• New or reaffirmed official statements from Rockstar Games or parent company Take-Two (e.g., earnings calls, press releases) that the November 2026 date is on track or slipping.  
• Credible industry reporting or leaks about development milestones, internal delays, or certification/marketing readiness.  
• Market reactions in gaming media that might feed directly into Metaculus user sentiment during the next two weeks.  
Therefore, queries should target February 2026 coverage, especially investor-relations news, reputable gaming outlets, and leak trackers.
