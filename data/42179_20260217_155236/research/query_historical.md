Analysis:
The key driver of whether the Metaculus community prediction rises above 65 % in the next 11 days is any fresh information that changes beliefs about Rockstar’s ability to hit the currently-scheduled November 2026 launch. Evidence that development is on track (e.g., ratings-board filings, marketing ramp-ups, investor call assurances) would push the probability up; credible rumors of another slip into 2027 would push it down. Therefore the most useful historical context is very recent news, leaks, or corporate statements published in February 2026 about GTA VI’s production status or release timeline rather than long-past background about earlier delays.
