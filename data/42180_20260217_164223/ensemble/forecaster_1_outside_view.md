Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Google Trends Historical Data (Most Recent)**
- Current value: 1 (as of Feb 17, 2026)
- Quality: Primary data source, highly reliable
- Key insight: Venezuela search interest has been extremely low and stable (value of 1-2) for the past month, with a dramatic drop from the 90-day mean of 4.4. The 90-day period includes a major spike (likely early January 2026 related to Maduro's capture).

**Agent Report on Scheduled Events**
- Quality: Comprehensive search for scheduled events
- Key findings: Only Carnival (Feb 16-17) is scheduled; no other major events planned for Feb 18-27
- Historical context: Past spikes occurred during unscheduled events (blackouts, military incidents, political crises), not routine holidays
- Notable: Jan 3, 2026 spike from U.S. military action near Caracas; multiple 2019 spikes from blackouts and border clashes

**Click Orlando Article (Feb 11, 2026)**
- Quality: Reputable news source, recent and factual
- Content: U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright's three-day visit to Venezuela (Feb 11-13)
- Significance: Major diplomatic development but occurred before our forecast window; any immediate search spike would have appeared by Feb 17

**InSight Crime Event Announcement**
- Quality: Specialized crime/security analysis organization
- Content: Announces Feb 27, 2026 webinar about organized crime in Venezuela
- Significance: This is a donor-exclusive event, unlikely to generate public search interest

**Holland & Knight Webinar**
- Quality: Law firm promotional content
- Significance: Closed to press, unlikely to drive public searches

**Statista and Trading View Articles**
- Quality: Data aggregation sites
- Content: Economic statistics (inflation, interest rates)
- Significance: Background context only; not news-driving events

**Clicks.so Article**
- Quality: Low - appears to be template/placeholder with no actual data
- Significance: None for forecasting purposes

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **All 10-day windows in the past 90 days** (from Google Trends data)
   - Suitability: HIGH - Most directly applicable
   - Data: 75% "no change" (≤3 points), 12% increase, 12% decrease
   - Limitation: Includes the exceptional Jan 3 spike period

2. **10-day windows during low-baseline periods (value ≤2)**
   - Suitability: VERY HIGH - Most relevant to current conditions
   - Current context: Value has been 1 for past 15 days, extremely stable
   - Pattern: When at such low values, dramatic changes require major news events

3. **Post-major-event stabilization periods**
   - Suitability: HIGH - We're in aftermath of Jan 3, 2026 event
   - Pattern: After spikes, interest typically returns to baseline and remains stable unless new catalyst emerges

**Selected Reference Class:** 10-day windows during low-baseline periods (≤2), weighted with the general 90-day distribution.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 10 days (Feb 17-27, 2026)

**Current State (Feb 17):**
- Value: 1 (extremely low)
- Trend: Flat for 15 consecutive days
- Context: Post-spike stabilization after Jan 3 event

**Historical Patterns:**
- When value is at 1-2 and stable, it typically remains stable unless a major unscheduled event occurs
- Major spikes historically came from: blackouts (Mar 2019, Aug 2024), military incidents (Jan 2026), border clashes (Feb 2019)
- Routine events like Carnival don't drive U.S. search interest
- The Feb 11 Energy Secretary visit didn't produce a visible spike by Feb 17

**Key Considerations:**
- No scheduled events Feb 18-27 that would drive U.S. searches
- Venezuela's infrastructure remains fragile (blackout risk)
- U.S.-Venezuela relations remain tense (military incident risk)
- However, such events are unpredictable and relatively rare

## (d) Justification

The outside view strongly favors "Doesn't change":

1. **Baseline stability**: The value has been 1 for 15 consecutive days, showing extreme stability at the floor level.

2. **Statistical base rate**: 75% of 10-day windows show ≤3 point changes, and this percentage is likely higher when starting from such a low baseline.

3. **Absence of scheduled catalysts**: No events are planned for Feb 18-27 that would drive U.S. public interest.

4. **Recent news already absorbed**: The Feb 11 Energy Secretary visit (the most significant recent development) occurred 6 days ago without producing a spike by Feb 17.

5. **Historical pattern**: Spikes require major unscheduled events (blackouts, military incidents). While possible, these are relatively rare - the 90-day data shows only one major spike despite ongoing instability.

6. **Low starting point**: At value 1, there's limited room to decrease further, and increases require substantial news to move the needle.

The main risk to this forecast is an unscheduled major event (blackout, military incident, political crisis), but these cannot be predicted and historically occur infrequently enough that the base rate favors stability.

Outside view calibration:

**Tethering to established distributions:**
- The 75/12/12 split from the 90-day data provides a strong anchor
- However, this includes the volatile January period
- When filtering for low-baseline periods, stability is even more pronounced

**Rate of upsets:**
- In Venezuela-related searches, major upsets occur but are relatively rare (perhaps 1-2 per quarter based on the 90-day data showing one major spike)
- Over a 10-day window, the probability of such an event is low but non-zero

**Calibration adjustments:**
- Starting from 75/12/12 base rate
- Increase "Doesn't change" probability because:
  - Current value is at floor (1), showing extreme stability
  - No scheduled catalysts
  - Recent diplomatic news already absorbed
- Slightly favor "Increases" over "Decreases" because:
  - Limited downside from value of 1
  - Small upside movements more likely than further drops
  - Any minor news would push up, not down

**Final calibration:**
- "Doesn't change": 80% (increased from 75% base due to extreme current stability)
- "Increases": 15% (slightly above 12% base, accounting for asymmetric risk from floor value)
- "Decreases": 5% (reduced from 12% base due to limited downside from value of 1)

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 15
Doesn't change: 80
Decreases: 5
