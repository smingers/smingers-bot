Analysis:

**Paraphrased Resolution Criteria:**
Will Google Trends value for "venezuela" (US) on 2026-02-27 differ by >3 points from 2026-02-17 value? Increases if >3 higher, Decreases if >3 lower, Doesn't change if within ±3.

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Outside View Sources:**
1. **GoogleTrendsData (90-day extract):** High-quality quantitative data showing current value=1 (floor level) on 90-day scale. 75% of 10-day windows showed no change (±3), 12% increased, 12% decreased. Most reliable source—factual, recent, directly relevant.

2. **Agent historical spike report:** Documents six verified past spikes (2019 blackouts, Jan 3 2026 military action, etc.). Factual compilation showing what drives searches. Useful context.

3. **ClickOrlando (Feb 11, 2026):** Mainstream U.S. outlet reporting Energy Secretary visit. Factual but event concluded before forecast window—minimal impact expected.

4. **Other sources (Statista, TradingView, webinar promos):** Low relevance—either historical macro data or niche professional events unlikely to move mass searches.

**AskNews Articles (Feb 16-17, 2026):**

5. **Multiple sources on Maduro arrest (Jan 3, 2026):** Chicago Tribune, Infobae, CNBC, Chinese/Russian sources all report U.S. military operation capturing Maduro on Jan 3, 2026. This is **past news** (occurred 45 days before forecast window). Already reflected in historical data showing spike then decay. Factual but backward-looking.

6. **Venezuelan real estate surge articles (Feb 16-17, 2026):** NYT/Clarin/Infobae report 20-50% property price increases driven by diaspora interest post-Maduro. **Moderate evidence** of sustained interest but focused on expatriate/investor community, not mass U.S. public searches. Niche economic story.

7. **Oil sector developments (Feb 16-17, 2026):** Multiple sources (La Nacion, Infobae, Semana.com) report Venezuela becoming 5th largest U.S. oil supplier, new hydrocarbon laws, OFAC General License 50. **Strong factual evidence** of ongoing U.S.-Venezuela commercial engagement. However, these are technical/business stories unlikely to drive mass Google searches unless paired with dramatic news.

8. **Colombian peso/economic articles:** Tangentially mention Venezuela but focus on Colombia. Low relevance.

9. **Trump visit statement (Feb 16, 2026):** Chinese source reports Trump plans Venezuela visit (timing unclear). **Weak evidence**—single non-Western source, no confirmation from U.S. outlets, vague timing. If confirmed and imminent, could drive searches; currently speculative.

**Source Quality Assessment:**
- Highest quality: GoogleTrendsData, mainstream Western outlets (Chicago Tribune, CNBC, NYT)
- Moderate quality: Regional Latin American outlets (Infobae, Clarin, Semana)
- Lower quality: Single Chinese source on Trump visit (unconfirmed)
- Noise: Webinar promos, race calendars, conference listings

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Current floor-level value (1/100):** Starting point is at absolute bottom of 90-day range. Mathematical asymmetry—easier to rise than fall further.
- **Historical base rate (75/12/12):** Empirically derived from directly comparable recent period.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Oil sector normalization:** Multiple independent sources confirm Venezuela-U.S. oil relationship strengthening. This is ongoing structural change but generates business/trade news, not mass-public search drivers.
- **Real estate market activity:** Consistent reporting across sources of property market reactivation. Niche story affecting diaspora, not broad U.S. public.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Trump visit claim:** Single unconfirmed source. If true and announced during window, could spike searches; currently too speculative.
- **Carnival (Feb 17):** Calendar event but historically doesn't move U.S. searches absent unrest.
- **Webinars/conferences:** Professional events with minimal public reach.

**Key Observation:** No major scheduled events (elections, sports, summits) in the 10-day window. All significant recent news (Maduro arrest, oil reforms) occurred weeks ago and is already "priced in" to current low baseline.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Forecast Horizon:** 10 days (Feb 17-27, 2026)

**If halved to 5 days:** Would increase confidence in "Doesn't change" to ~80-85%. Shorter windows reduce probability of random news shocks. Historical volatility is already low; compressing time further favors status quo.

**If doubled to 20 days:** Would shift toward more uncertainty—perhaps 65% no change, 20% increase, 15% decrease. Longer windows increase exposure to unpredictable events (policy announcements, accidents, protests). The Jan 3 spike occurred unexpectedly; a 20-day window doubles the "opportunity" for such shocks.

**Current 10-day window:** Balanced between short-term stability and realistic shock probability. Base rate of 12% for increases/decreases over 10 days seems empirically grounded.

**(d) Justification:**

**Factors Supporting "Doesn't Change" (Status Quo):**
1. **Empirical dominance:** 75% of recent comparable windows showed stability
2. **News vacuum:** No major scheduled events in forecast window
3. **Post-spike decay pattern:** Major news (Maduro arrest) occurred 45 days ago; searches have returned to baseline
4. **Business vs. public interest:** Current Venezuela news is technical (oil contracts, investment laws)—important but not search-driving for general public

**Factors Supporting "Increases":**
1. **Floor effect:** Value=1 creates mathematical asymmetry—any minor uptick registers as change
2. **Geopolitical volatility:** Venezuela remains unstable; unscheduled shocks (blackouts, protests, Trump announcements) can erupt
3. **Trump factor:** If visit is announced or occurs during window, would spike searches
4. **Oil price sensitivity:** Any disruption to Venezuelan oil supply could generate headlines

**Factors Supporting "Decreases":**
1. **Minimal downside room:** Already at floor in 90-day frame
2. **30-day scale ambiguity:** Resolution uses different date range (Jan 28-Feb 27); current value there is 43, which could decay if no news

**Critical Assessment:**
The outside view base rate (75/12/12) was derived from 90-day data where starting value varied. Current situation is unusual—we're at the absolute floor (value=1). This creates asymmetry not fully captured in the base rate. However, the resolution criteria uses a *different* date range (Jan 28-Feb 27) where the current value is 43, not 1. This is crucial.

**Recalibration:** The resolution URL locks dates to Jan 28-Feb 27, a 30-day window. In that frame, Feb 17's value is somewhere mid-range (not floor). The question states current value is 43 "compared to last 30 days." This means 43 is the Feb 16 value on the Jan 17-Feb 16 scale. The resolution scale (Jan 28-Feb 27) will show a different value for Feb 17, and we're predicting Feb 27 on that scale.

**Key Insight:** Without knowing Feb 17's value on the resolution scale, we're forecasting blind. However, the pattern holds: absent major news, values drift within ±3 points. The 75/12/12 base rate remains applicable because it reflects typical 10-day volatility regardless of absolute level.

**Adjustment Rationale:**
- Keep base rate largely intact (75/12/12) because it's empirically robust
- Slight shift from "Decreases" to "Increases" (2-3 points) due to:
  * Ongoing structural changes (oil normalization) creating modest upward pressure
  * Geopolitical volatility slightly favoring surprise upside
  * No evidence of negative catalysts that would drive searches down

**Final Calibration:**
- Increases: 14% (up from 12% base rate—modest bump for asymmetry and ongoing engagement stories)
- Doesn't change: 76% (essentially base rate—dominant pattern of stability)
- Decreases: 10% (down from 12%—reduced due to lack of negative catalysts and floor effects)

Probability Calibration:

Starting from outside view base rate of 75% no change, 12% increase, 12% decrease.

**Adjustments:**
1. **+2 points to Increases:** Floor-level starting position and ongoing oil/economic normalization create slight upward bias
2. **+1 point to Doesn't change:** Reinforcing empirical dominance of stability
3. **-2 points to Decreases:** Minimal downside catalysts; structural factors favor stability or modest rise
4. **-1 point from Decreases to Increases:** Asymmetry adjustment

**Final Distribution:**
- Increases: 14%
- Doesn't change: 76%
- Decreases: 10%

**Confidence Check:** This distribution reflects high confidence in status quo (76%) while acknowledging realistic probability of surprise events (14% up, 10% down). The 7.6:1 odds on "no change" feel appropriate given empirical data and absence of scheduled catalysts. The 1.4:1 ratio favoring increases over decreases reflects modest structural factors and asymmetry without overweighting speculative scenarios.

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** ✓ Predict if Google Trends value changes by >3 points between Feb 17-27, 2026.

2. **Base rate:** ✓ Started with 75/12/12 from 90-day empirical data; final prediction (76/14/10) stays close.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely=Doesn't change (76%); Least likely=Decreases (10%). Makes sense—no major catalysts, empirical pattern favors stability, slight upward bias from structural factors.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - 75% of recent 10-day windows showed stability (factual, high quality)
   - Current value at/near floor creates asymmetry (factual, mathematical)
   - No scheduled major events in window (factual, calendar-based)
   - Oil normalization ongoing but niche story (factual, moderate relevance)
   - Trump visit claim unconfirmed (speculative, low weight)

5. **Blind spot:** Trump announces imminent Venezuela visit during window, generating major media coverage and search spike. Would make "Increases" correct. Probability: ~5-8% (within my 14% allocation but on high end). Could also see unexpected crisis (blackout, protest violence) spiking searches.

6. **Status quo:** Strong status quo bias appropriate here—76% reflects world changing slowly. Could nudge to 78% but current calibration already conservative.

7. **Technicalities:** ✓ Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [14, 76, 10]
