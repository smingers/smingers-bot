Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Google Trends Historical Data (Most Recent)**
- Current value: 1 (Feb 17, 2026)
- Quality: Primary data source, highly reliable
- Key insight: Interest has been extremely low and stable (value of 1) for the past 15 days (Feb 3-17). The 90-day base rate shows 75% of 10-day windows result in changes ≤3 points.

**Agent Report on Scheduled Events**
- Quality: Comprehensive search for scheduled events
- Key findings: Only Carnival (Feb 17) is scheduled; no other major events planned for Feb 18-27
- Historical context: Past spikes occurred during unscheduled events (blackouts, military incidents, political crises), not routine holidays
- Notable: Multiple historical spikes occurred in late Feb/early March (2019 aid convoy clashes, blackouts)

**US Energy Secretary Visit (Click Orlando, Feb 11, 2026)**
- Factual event: Chris Wright visited Venezuela Feb 11-13, 2026
- Quality: Recent, verifiable news from credible outlet
- Observation: Despite this significant diplomatic visit, Google Trends remained at 1 throughout Feb 11-17, suggesting even major policy news doesn't automatically drive search interest

**InSight Crime Event Announcement**
- Scheduled event: Feb 27, 2026 webinar on Venezuela's organized crime
- Quality: Event announcement, not news-driving content
- Relevance: Unlikely to impact public search interest (donor-exclusive, specialized audience)

**Holland & Knight Webinar**
- Similar to above: Legal/investment webinar, closed to press
- Relevance: Minimal impact on general public search behavior

**Statista Inflation Data & Trading View Interest Rates**
- Quality: Statistical reference material
- Relevance: Background economic data, not news-driving events

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **10-day windows in the past 90 days for Venezuela searches**
   - Suitability: HIGH - Direct historical pattern for same topic and timeframe
   - Data: 75% no change (≤3 points), 12% increase, 12% decrease

2. **Post-major-news periods for Venezuela**
   - Suitability: MODERATE - The Energy Secretary visit (Feb 11) was significant but didn't move the needle
   - Pattern: When major news doesn't create immediate spike, interest typically remains low

3. **Carnival holiday periods**
   - Suitability: LOW-MODERATE - Agent report shows Carnival alone doesn't drive US searches unless coupled with crisis
   - Historical: Feb 2019 spike was due to aid convoy violence, not Carnival itself

**Selected Reference Class:** 10-day windows in past 90 days - most directly applicable with clear base rate data.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window:** 10 days (Feb 17-27, 2026)

**Current State (Feb 17):**
- Value: 1 (extremely low)
- Trend: Stable at 1 for past 15 days
- Context: Even significant diplomatic visit (Feb 11-13) didn't increase interest

**Historical Patterns:**
- When value is at 1-2 (very low baseline), it typically remains stable
- Major spikes (to 50-100) occurred only during:
  - Military incidents (Jan 3, 2026: explosions near Caracas)
  - Nationwide blackouts (multiple in 2019, Aug 2024)
  - Violent political confrontations (Feb 2019 border clashes)
- These events are unpredictable and sudden

**Key Observation:** The value has been remarkably stable at 1 despite:
- Major US diplomatic engagement (Energy Secretary visit)
- Ongoing political transition (new acting president)
- Oil sector reforms

## (d) Justification

**Factors Supporting "Doesn't Change" (≤3 point change):**

1. **Strong base rate**: 75% of 10-day windows show ≤3 point changes
2. **Current extreme low**: At value 1, there's limited room to decrease further
3. **Recent stability**: 15 consecutive days at value 1 despite significant news
4. **No scheduled catalysts**: No major events planned for Feb 18-27
5. **Diminishing news cycle**: Energy Secretary visit (most significant recent event) is now 6+ days old with no search impact

**Factors Supporting "Increases" (>3 point increase):**

1. **Historical precedent**: Late Feb/early March has seen spikes (2019)
2. **Unpredictable events**: Blackouts, military incidents can occur without warning
3. **Political instability**: New government, ongoing US involvement creates potential for sudden news
4. **Low baseline**: Starting at 1 means even modest news could triple/quadruple the value

**Factors Supporting "Decreases" (>3 point decrease):**

1. **Floor effect**: At value 1, can only decrease to 0, limiting downside
2. **Probability**: Very low given mathematical constraints

Outside view calibration:

**Calibration Considerations:**

1. **Base rate anchoring**: The 75%/12%/12% split from historical 10-day windows is my primary anchor
2. **Current context adjustment**: The extreme stability at value 1 for 15 days strengthens the "no change" case beyond the base rate
3. **Asymmetric risk**: From value 1, increases are more likely than decreases due to floor effect
4. **Black swan potential**: Historical spikes were unpredictable but occurred ~3-4 times in 90 days (≈4% daily probability of spike-triggering event)

**Probability reasoning:**

- Base rate suggests 75% no change, but current 15-day stability at value 1 increases this
- The floor effect (can't go much below 1) reduces decrease probability below the 12% base rate
- Unpredictable events could cause increases, but the lack of response to recent major news (Energy Secretary visit) suggests higher threshold for public interest
- Over 10 days, probability of a spike-triggering event: roughly 1 - (0.96^10) ≈ 34%, but most spikes in history went to 50-100, not just above 4

**Final calibration:**
- "Doesn't change": Increase from 75% base to ~80% due to extreme current stability
- "Increases": Reduce from 12% base to ~18% (accounting for asymmetric floor effect and unpredictable event risk)
- "Decreases": Reduce from 12% base to ~2% (floor effect makes this mathematically unlikely)

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 18%
Doesn't change: 80%
Decreases: 2%
