Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-27 (US, fixed window 2026-01-28 to 2026-02-27), compare Google Trends “venezuela” values: +>3 = Increases; within ±3 = Doesn’t change; <-3 = Decreases.

2) Outside-view base rates (given)
Increases 18 / Doesn’t change 80 / Decreases 2.

(a) Source analysis (what each adds; quality/date)

**Holland & Knight webinar page (HKlaw, Feb 2026)**  
- Content: promotional webinar on political/regulatory shifts and investment outlook; claims “cautiously reemerging” interest.  
- Quality: credible organization but not a news event with mass reach; mostly expert-marketing.  
- Relevance: weak-to-moderate as a *small* catalyst for niche audiences, unlikely to move US Google Trends much.

**Finishers race calendar (undated listing)**  
- Content: sports events in Venezuela later in 2026/early 2027.  
- Quality: fine for what it is; not news.  
- Relevance: essentially none for Feb 17–27, 2026.

**Conferencealerts.co.in listing (Feb 2026 page)**  
- Content: appears incomplete/placeholder; no concrete Venezuela events in the target window.  
- Quality: low.  
- Relevance: none.

**AskNews: Pulzo (Feb 17, 2026) – Colombian peso article**  
- Content: mainly Colombia FX/monetary policy; includes an obviously false claim about “President Trump” and Venezuela extraction.  
- Quality: the Venezuela-related claim is unreliable; treat as noise.  
- Relevance: none (if anything, highlights risk of misinformation).

**AskNews: Clarín (Feb 17, 2026) / Chicago Tribune (Feb 16, 2026) / Infobae & Pulzo (Feb 16, 2026)**  
- Content: syndications of a NYT-style story: Venezuelan housing/real-estate prices rising 20–50% amid post-Maduro optimism; diaspora interest.  
- Quality: mixed outlets but internally consistent and plausibly sourced (agents, interviews).  
- Relevance: could create *some* English/Spanish-language searches, but likely modest in US because it’s not breaking security news.

**AskNews: La Nación opinion (Feb 17, 2026)**  
- Content: oil-sector institutional reforms; geopolitical framing; some factual references (hydrocarbons law Jan 29, 2026) embedded in opinion.  
- Quality: medium (op-ed).  
- Relevance: niche; limited broad US search impact.

**AskNews: Infobae (Feb 17, 2026) – EIA “5th-largest oil supplier”**  
- Content: concrete hook tied to US energy trade; cites EIA and recent trends.  
- Quality: moderate (secondary reporting but references a primary data source).  
- Relevance: among the more plausible drivers of US searches (energy/trade angle), though still not guaranteed to trend.

**AskNews: wallstreet:online (Feb 16, 2026) – Maurel & Prom update (OFAC GL 50 Feb 13, 2026)**  
- Content: corporate update referencing OFAC General License 50 and readiness to restart operations.  
- Quality: relatively strong for the fact “GL 50 issued” (corporate comms; still checkable).  
- Relevance: could contribute to “Venezuela + sanctions/oil” searches in financial circles; usually small in general-population Trends.

**Older Jan 3–5, 2026 items (CNBC/Investing.com/Barchart/Chinese sources/Folha/Eastmoney)**  
- Content: dramatic “US capture/invasion/Trump” narrative.  
- Quality: some elements appear inconsistent with reality; and in any case are outside the resolution window and mainly show prior spikes can occur with major shocks.  
- Relevance: mostly serves as context that *true* shocks move searches; absent a new shock, interest tends to revert to baseline.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution)

**Strong evidence (little-to-no change favored)**
- Outside-view empirical base rate: ~75% of recent 10-day windows are within ±3 (given). This is directly matched to the resolution rule.  
- Floor effect: if the Feb 17 value is very low (outside view cites ~1), “Decreases” is mechanically constrained (can’t drop by >3 easily).

**Moderate evidence (some tilt toward increase)**
- Multiple contemporaneous Venezuela-related business/energy stories dated Feb 16–17 (EIA supplier rank; OFAC GL50; hydrocarbons reform discussion). These are plausible US-facing hooks (oil trade/sanctions) and could create a mild uptick.  
- Clustering: several outlets repeating Venezuela developments in the same week modestly raises odds of at least a +4 move versus a dead-flat series.

**Weak evidence (minimal impact)**
- Webinars/conference listings: niche audience; unlikely to move nationwide US Google Trends.  
- Real-estate diaspora stories: interesting but not typically a “country-name spike” driver unless tied to a bigger breaking event.

Net: evidence modestly increases the chance of “Increases” relative to the outside view, mostly by raising the probability of a small but >3 point move; it does not create a strong case for a sustained or large spike.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Window length: 10 days (Feb 17 → Feb 27).  
- If halved (~5 days): higher “Doesn’t change” probability (less time for a news shock).  
- If doubled (~20 days): higher “Increases” probability (more opportunities for an incident, policy announcement, or energy-market headline to break through).

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustments from base rates)
Status quo is low, stable interest; absent a new crisis/incident, it likely stays within ±3. However, compared with the outside view, I slightly nudge probability toward “Increases” because:
- There is a current mini-cluster of US-relevant energy/sanctions developments (OFAC license reference; EIA supplier ranking) dated Feb 16–17, which can plausibly lift “venezuela” searches even if not to dramatic levels.
- “Decreases” remains extremely unlikely due to the floor effect and the typical noisiness being symmetric around a low baseline.

Probability calibration
- Start from outside view: [18, 80, 2].  
- Adjust +4 to “Increases” (news clustering with US energy/sanctions angle), -4 from “Doesn’t change”; keep “Decreases” at floor-like 2 due to mechanical constraint and lack of a clear down-driver.

Checklist:
1) Criteria/options aligned? Yes: compare Feb 27 vs Feb 17 on fixed-window Trends; >3 up/down or within ±3.
2) Outside view used? Yes: anchored on [18,80,2].
3) Consistency check: Most likely = Doesn’t change; least likely = Decreases; aligns with stability + floor effect.
4) Key evidence (<=20 words each):
   - Base rate: ~75% of 10-day windows stay within ±3.
   - Very low baseline implies “Decreases” hard to achieve (floor effect).
   - Feb 16–17 cluster: EIA supplier ranking, OFAC GL50 reference, oil-law reform coverage.
   - Webinars/listings likely too niche to move Trends materially.
5) Blind spot: a sudden security/political shock (violence, coup attempt, major US action) could spike searches >+3 quickly.
6) Status quo outcome favored? Yes, remains the plurality with modest hedge toward increase.
7) Probabilities sum to 100 and within 0–100? Yes.

Probabilities: [22, 76, 2]
