Analysis

1. Paraphrased resolution rule (≤30 words)  
Compare the “venezuela” Google-Trends value for 17 Feb 2026 with that for 27 Feb 2026 (US, fixed 28 Jan-27 Feb date range).  
>3 higher → “Increases”; within ±3 → “Doesn’t change”; >3 lower → “Decreases”.

2. Outside-view base rate (last 90-day history, 10-day windows, ±3 rule)  
Increases 12 % Doesn’t change 76 % Decreases 12 %

3. Source & evidence analysis (abridged)

A. Same-day (17 Feb 26) news wires – Infobae, La Nación, Semana, Clarín, Pulzo, etc.  
   • All recap the 3 Jan U.S. arrest of Maduro; focus on oil, real-estate, business opportunities.  
   • Factual reporting; reputable outlets; no scheduled events 17-27 Feb likely to dominate U.S. search traffic.  
   • Evidence weight: weak–moderate (they confirm background saturation, not fresh catalysts).

B. Policy/industry notes – OFAC GL-50, Maurel & Prom release, Holland & Knight webinar.  
   • Niche, business-to-business interest; unlikely to move general-public search volume.  
   • Evidence weight: weak.

C. Rumoured Trump visit, other speculative pieces (Chinese portal, Russian Investing.com)  
   • Low reliability; no firm date; still only talk.  
   • Evidence weight: weak.

D. Calendar items in window – none of national relevance except Carnival (17-18 Feb, mainly domestic).  
   • Historically little U.S. search lift.  
   • Evidence weight: weak.

E. Trend momentum – last 30-day graph shows value 43 (mid-range of scale that peaked near 100 in early Jan). Daily line has flattened for two+ weeks.  
   • Evidence weight: moderate (recent stability implies small moves).

Overall weighting  
Strong evidence: none  
Moderate: recent flat trend, decaying interest after early-Jan spike.  
Weak: all other items.

4. Timeframe  
10 days until resolution.  
If window were halved (5 days): even stronger bias to “Doesn’t change”.  
If doubled (20 days): drift-down risk rises, nudging “Decreases” a few points higher.

5. Justification for inside-view shift  
• Post-shock attention decay generally tapers, but most of the drop already occurred in January; present level has stabilised.  
• No credible news hooks scheduled inside window to lift searches >3 points.  
• Mild downward drift (interest fatigue) is likelier than a fresh spike; therefore transfer some probability from “Doesn’t change” to “Decreases”, little to “Increases”.

Probability calibration (inside view)

Start with 12/76/12.  
Adjust −11 pp from “Doesn’t change”:  
 • +10 pp to “Decreases” (decay bias)  
 • +1 pp to “Increases” (tail risk of surprise).  

Final distribution

Probabilities: [13, 65, 22]

Checklist  
• Most likely = Doesn’t change; least likely = Increases — coherent with arguments.  
• Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
 1. Last-90-day windows: 75 % stayed within ±3.  
 2. Daily line flat for two weeks around 40-45.  
 3. No major scheduled events 17-27 Feb.  
 4. Attention already fell from Jan-3 peak; residual downward drift plausible.  
• Blind spot: sudden violent clash (military, border) raising U.S. media coverage—would swing to “Increases”.  
• Status-quo bias retained (65 %).
