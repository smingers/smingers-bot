------------------------ FORECASTING CHECKLIST ------------------------
1. Resolution in ≤30 words  
Compare the Google-Trends value for “venezuela” (U.S., fixed window 28 Jan-27 Feb 2026).  
If 27 Feb is >3 higher/lower than 17 Feb → “Increases/Decreases”; otherwise “Doesn’t change”.

2. Outside-view base rate (derived from last nine 10-day windows)  
Increases 15 | Doesn’t change 82 | Decreases 3

3. Consistency check  
Most likely = Doesn’t change; least likely = Increases.  Matches argument that no major scheduled trigger is expected and trend is drifting lower.

4. Key evidence (≤20 words each)  
• Post-Jan-3 search spike has decayed steadily from 100→43 in one month.  
• No elections, sporting finals, or U.S. policy deadlines fall 17-27 Feb.  
• Daily news flow (oil licences, real-estate pieces) sustains, not escalates, attention.  
• Starting value (~43) leaves room for >3-point drop; historical drift after spikes is downward.

5. Blind-spot scenario  
A sudden, broadcast Trump visit or fresh military development inside the 10-day window reignites U.S. media, pushing the index >60.

6. Status-quo bias  
Continuation of the month-long gentle slide is simplest; small nudge toward “Decreases” warranted.

7. Technicalities  
Probabilities sum to 100, no %, within 0-100.

ANALYSIS  

(a) Source analysis  
• Infobae, Pulzo, La Nación, Semana (Feb 17): mainstream Latin-American outlets; factual reporting on oil licences, real-estate interest; no announced events dated 17-27 Feb.  
• Holland & Knight webinar notice (Feb 17): promotional; indicates commercial curiosity but unlikely to move mass U.S. searches.  
• Wallstreet-online note on Maurel & Prom (Feb 16): niche investor news; limited audience.  
• Chinese, Russian, Brazilian financial portals (Jan 3-5) describing U.S. “invasion”: dated, already reflected in January spike.  
Overall quality: mainly factual reportage; no item announces a high-impact event within the forecast window.

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong: 30-day downward trajectory after one-off shock; such decay pattern recurred in past spikes (2019 blackout, 2023 sanctions episode).  
Moderate: Current cluster of Feb 17 articles may give a one-day bump, but similar clusters on Feb 10 produced only ~4-point wiggles.  
Weak: Webinar, conference listings, race calendars—niche traffic.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Forecast horizon = 10 days.  Halving to 5 days would raise “Doesn’t change” (volatility smaller).  Doubling to 20 days would raise “Decreases” as reversion more likely.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
• Unlike the outside-view sample (mostly baseline 0-5), today’s starting level is mid-forties, giving genuine headroom for a >3-point fall.  
• Structural decay after news shocks is well documented; average half-life ~7 days, matching ongoing slide.  
• Lack of scheduled catalysts tempers upside risk.  
• Floor effect that suppressed “Decreases” in the outside view no longer applies.  
Shift 29 pp from “Doesn’t change” to “Decreases”, trim 5 pp from “Increases”.

Probability calibration  
Final belief: Increases 10 | Doesn’t change 55 | Decreases 35  
Reflects modest but real chance of a new headline, dominant likelihood of mild drift or stability, sizeable tail for continued fade.
