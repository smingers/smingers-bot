Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
1. Clicks.so “Top Google searches in Venezuela” (undated template) – provides no quantitative data, low evidentiary value, no opinions from identifiable experts.  
2. Statista “Venezuela inflation rate 2026” (Jan-2026) – reputable statistics portal, factual macro-data; not germane to near-term U.S. Google-search behaviour.  
3. TradingView Venezuela interest-rate page (updated to Dec-2025) – factual market data, again not linked to search interest.  
4. ClickOrlando 11-Feb-2026 report on U.S. Energy Secretary visit – mainstream local news outlet, verifiable quotes, modest audience reach; event occurred six days before the forecast window.  
5. InSight Crime event notice (27-Feb-2026 webinar) – niche NGO, factual date of webinar; readership small, pay-wall.  
6. Holland & Knight webinar notice (Feb-2026) – law-firm marketing, factual; very limited public traction.  
7. Agent report on scheduled events – synthesised calendar check; notes only Carnival (17 Feb) inside the window. Quality: desk research, no strong assumptions.  
8. GoogleTrendsData (machine pull on 16 Feb 2026) – hard data on U.S. searches for “venezuela”; most salient source for the forecast.

b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
i. All 10-day windows for the Google-Trends topic “venezuela” over the past five years.  
ii. All 10-day windows for Latin-American country names with similar baseline attention (e.g., “colombia”, “peru”).  
iii. The last 90 days of “venezuela” only (most recent regime of very low values 0-5).

Choice: (i) is conceptually best but requires downloading years of daily data; in practice the question already supplies a smaller but serviceable empirical base: the last 90 days (choice iii). Because the variable has shown regime shifts (huge spikes in 2019, flat line lately), the most recent regime is the most predictive for the next ten days absent inside information.

c) Time-frame analysis  
• Forecast horizon: 10 calendar days (00:00 UTC 17 Feb 2026 to 23:59 UTC 27 Feb 2026).  
• In the last 90 days (nine 10-day windows) the absolute difference between day 0 and day 10 exceeded three points twice (1 up, 1 down) and stayed within ±3 seven times. Estimated base rates: 75 % “Doesn’t change”, 12.5 % “Increases”, 12.5 % “Decreases”.  
• When the starting value is ≤2 (today it is 1 on the locked 30-day scale) upward moves of >3 require a news shock large enough to push the relative scale to ≥5. Historically such shocks (blackouts, military actions) are rare – a few per year, not per month.

d) Justification  
1. Current baseline interest (value 1) is at the floor of the 0–100 scale; normal background fluctuation is 0–2, safely inside the ±3 band.  
2. No pre-scheduled mass-audience events fall inside the window apart from the tail-end of Carnival, which in earlier years has not lifted U.S. search traffic by >3 points unless coupled with crisis news.  
3. The low-attention regime has persisted for months despite notable headlines (e.g., seizure of Maduro on 3 Jan 2026); that event produced a one-day spike to ~40 but the series had already reverted to 1–2 by early February, showing rapid decay.  
4. Because neither side in U.S.–Venezuela relations has announced high-profile actions for the next ten days, the outside view treats another outsized shock as possible but improbable within any random 10-day slice.  
5. Downward moves of >3 points are constrained by the current near-zero level; the series cannot fall below 0, so large decreases are intrinsically less likely than large increases from this starting point. Empirically, decreases >3 have occurred only when the start value was >4. Therefore we shade probability away from “Decreases” toward “Doesn’t change”.

Outside view calibration:
• Anchor on empirical base rates: 75 % / 12.5 % / 12.5 %.  
• Adjust for floor effect: probability of a >3-point drop when starting at 1 is close to 0; reallocate most of that mass to “Doesn’t change”.  
• Leave a modest tail (~15 %) for a surprise news surge that could drive a >3-point increase.  
Resulting calibrated distribution: ≈15 % Increases, 82 % Doesn’t change, 3 % Decreases.

Outside View Prediction:
['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']:
Increases: 15%
Doesn't change: 82%
Decreases: 3%
