You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “venezuela” change between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-27 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “venezuela” at the time of writing this question (Feb 16, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 43; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=venezuela&date=2026-01-17%202026-02-16).

`{"format":"trends_interest_change_magnitude","info":{"topic":"venezuela","trend_start":"2026-02-17","trend_end":"2026-02-27","verification_url":"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=venezuela&date=2026-01-28%202026-02-27"}}`

The options are: ['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves “Doesn't change” if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=venezuela&date=2026-01-28%202026-02-27](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=venezuela&date=2026-01-28%202026-02-27) for 2026-02-27 is within 3 of the value at 2026-02-17. It resolves “Increases” if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves “Decreases” if the value is more than 3 lower.

# Summary of Article: "Venezuela inflation rate 2026 | Statista"

**Source:** Statista

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Historical hyperinflation peak:** Venezuela's hyperinflation peaked in 2018, when the annual inflation rate surged to over 65,370 percent.

2. **2026 inflation projection:** As of 2026, inflation in Venezuela remains very high, with an annual rate of 68.21 percent predicted for the year.

## Background Context Provided:

- **Definition of hyperinflation:** The article defines hyperinflation as a very high inflation rate that accelerates quickly, often caused by governments printing large amounts of new money to pay for expenses.

- **Causes of Venezuela's crisis:** The economic catastrophe began with government price controls and plummeting oil prices, which caused state-run oil companies to go bankrupt. The government then began printing new money, leading to rapidly rising prices, increased unemployment, and GDP collapse, all exacerbated by international sanctions.

- **Current situation:** Many Venezuelans are emigrating to find work and supplies elsewhere, and population growth is at a decade-low.

## Opinion (Unnamed Source):

- The article states that current president Nicolás Maduro "does not seem inclined to steer away from his course of price controls and economic mismanagement," and therefore "the standard of living in the country is not expected to improve significantly anytime soon."

**Note:** This opinion appears to be from Statista's editorial perspective rather than a named expert or specific source.

- **Delcy Rodríguez:** Acknowledged US-Venezuela relationship has had "highs and lows" but both countries are now working on a mutually benefiting "energy agenda"

**US Sanctions and Policy Actions:**

- Trump administration continues lifting sanctions to allow foreign companies to operate in Venezuela

Query: List major events concerning Venezuela scheduled for 17–27 Feb 2026 and give past instances when comparable events caused noticeable spikes in U.S. Google searches for “Venezuela”. Provide dates and a one-sentence description of each spike.
Major Venezuela-related events scheduled for the 10-day window 17 – 27 February 2026  

1. Carnival / Shrove Tuesday public holiday – Tuesday 17 Feb 2026  
   • The long-standing national “Carnaval” break in Venezuela runs on the Monday–Tuesday before Ash Wednesday and is the country’s next public holiday after New Year’s Day. (CalendarLabs, 2026 Venezuela Holidays).  
   • Although the formal holiday is 16–17 Feb, carnival street parties, concerts and televised parades normally spill over into the evening of the 17th and in tourist centres can last several days (National Today, Venezuela Carnival background).  

No other nationally scheduled political, sporting or economic events were found for 18 – 27 February 2026.  Venezuela’s next nationwide events on published calendars are Maundy Thursday/Good Friday (2–3 Apr 2026) and several trail-running races in late March and April (Finishers event calendar), but nothing falls inside the 10-day interval in question.  Likewise, the country’s next presidential and regional elections are not due until later in 2026–27, and no official debates or primaries are slated for mid-February (SIGLA Presidential Election Calendar; A-WEB electoral calendar).

Implication for Google-Trends forecasting  
• Because the only pre-announced national happening in the 17–27 Feb window is the second day of Carnival on 17 Feb, any change in U.S. Google search interest is more likely to be driven by unscheduled news (political crisis, U.S.–Venezuela confrontation, major blackout, etc.) than by a diary event.  
• Historical Google-Trends behaviour shows that routine holidays such as Carnival rarely create large U.S. search spikes by themselves; search peaks have instead occurred when Carnival coincided with political turmoil (e.g., February 2019, see below).  

Past spikes in U.S. Google searches for “Venezuela” and the triggering events  
(The dates below correspond to the day Google Trends usually shows the local maximum; each is accompanied by one-sentence context.  All events are of the same broad types—political confrontation, nationwide blackout, or explosive military episode—that could again happen without notice in February 2026.)

1. 23 Feb 2019 – Aid-convoy clashes on the Colombia and Brazil borders  
   Violent confrontations between opposition supporters attempting to bring humanitarian aid into Venezuela and security forces loyal to President Maduro killed at least four people and dominated international news. (Slate, 23 Feb 2019; TIME, 24 Feb 2019; Business Insider, 23 Feb 2019)

2. 7 Mar 2019 – Start of the first nationwide blackout  
   A massive failure at the Guri hydroelectric complex plunged all 23 Venezuelan states into darkness for five days, disrupting water, transport and hospitals and prompting global headlines. (CNN, 23 Jul 2019 retrospect; Borgen Project, 5 Feb 2021)

3. 23–25 Mar 2019 – Second and third nationwide blackouts  
   Repeated grid collapses later in March kept much of the country without electricity and again pushed “Venezuela” to the top of U.S. Google real-time trending searches. (CNN, 23 Jul 2019; Borgen Project, 5 Feb 2021)

4. 3 Jan 2026 – Reports of explosions and U.S. military escalation near Caracas  
   Loud blasts over the capital, smoke near a major base and statements from both the Maduro government and the White House sparked a surge of U.S. searches, with multiple outlets noting “Venezuela” was trending on Google that day. (Times Now News, 3 Jan 2026)

5. 30 Aug 2024 – Nation-wide blackout amid post-election tension  
   A dawn power failure that the government called “electrical sabotage” left all 24 states partly or fully without electricity, feeding fears of unrest after the disputed 28 July 2024 election and driving a fresh spike in search interest. (Al Jazeera, 30 Aug 2024)

6. 23 Jul 2019 – Fourth 2019 nationwide blackout (“electromagnetic attack” claim)  
   Power again failed across most of Venezuela, with officials alleging an “electromagnetic attack” and ordering work stoppages, drawing another round of intense international attention. (CNN, 23 Jul 2019)

Why these comparators matter for 17–27 Feb 2026  
• Three of the historical spikes (items 1, 2, 3) took place in late February or March and began just days after Carnival celebrations, showing that routine holiday coverage alone is not enough to cause U.S. interest surges, but that the same period can become extremely news-sensitive when coupled with political flashpoints or infrastructure failures.  
• Item 4 (Jan 2026) demonstrates that sudden U.S.–Venezuela military incidents still produce immediate Google-trends spikes, indicating that a similar unplanned escalation—even if rumours only—during the forecast window would likely lift the 27 Feb value well above the 17 Feb baseline.  
• Items 2, 3, 5, 6 underline that large-scale power outages—typically unpredictable—have repeatedly pushed “Venezuela” searches above normal levels and could do so again without warning.

Information gaps  
No authoritative source yet lists any governmental, judicial or sporting event inside 18 – 27 Feb 2026 that might systematically move U.S. search interest.  Continuous monitoring of unscheduled developments (e.g., electricity grid stability, U.S.–Venezuela military posture, opposition activity) is therefore essential to assess the likelihood of a trend change between 17 Feb and 27 Feb 2026.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
