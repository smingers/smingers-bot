Disagreement Analysis:

**Disagreement 1: Current baseline value of "venezuela" on Google Trends**
This is the most critical disagreement. Forecasters 1 and 2 appear to believe the current value is at or near 1 (the floor), while forecasters 4 and 5 believe it is in the mid-40s range. Forecaster 3 seems to acknowledge low values but also references news clustering. This disagreement is enormous because it completely changes the probability of "Decreases" — if the value is ~1, it literally cannot decrease by more than 3 points (floor effect), making "Decreases" nearly impossible. If the value is ~43, there is substantial room for both increases and decreases. This single disagreement accounts for the massive spread: forecasters 1/2 put "Decreases" at 5-10%, while forecaster 5 puts it at 35%.

**Disagreement 2: Whether post-spike decay is still ongoing or has stabilized**
Forecasters 4 and 5 believe there was a major spike in early January 2026 and that interest is still decaying from that spike, creating a structural downward drift. Forecasters 1 and 2 seem to believe the value has already stabilized at a low floor. This affects whether "Decreases" or "Doesn't change" is more likely.

**Disagreement 3: Probability of a news-driven spike in the 10-day window**
Forecasters range from 10% (forecaster 5) to 22% (forecaster 3) on "Increases." Forecaster 3 cites a Feb 16-17 news cluster (EIA supplier ranking, OFAC GL50 reference) as a potential catalyst, while others see no significant catalysts. This is a moderate disagreement.

Root Causes:

1. **Baseline value disagreement**: This stems from **different factual beliefs**. Some forecasters appear to have looked at daily granularity data showing values of ~1, while others are reading the 30-day summary value of 43. The resolution URL uses a specific date range (Jan 28 - Feb 27) which will produce its own relative scaling. This is a verifiable factual question about what the actual Google Trends values are on the specific resolution URL.

2. **Post-spike decay**: This stems from **different factual beliefs** about recent Google Trends trajectory. Whether there was a January spike and whether decay is ongoing is verifiable.

3. **News catalyst probability**: This stems from **different weighting of the same evidence** and is largely a judgment call, though the existence of specific upcoming events is factual.
