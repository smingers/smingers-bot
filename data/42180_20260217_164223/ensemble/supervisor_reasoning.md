Resolution of Disagreements:

**Disagreement 1 (Critical): Current baseline value of "venezuela" on Google Trends**

The research strongly resolves this. The BBC article confirms that on January 3, 2026, US special forces launched a military raid to seize Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro. This was an extraordinary, unprecedented event that would have caused a massive spike in Google Trends interest. The question states the current value as of Feb 16 is 43 compared to the last 30 days. This is consistent with forecasters 4 and 5's interpretation that interest spiked enormously in early January and has been decaying since. The value of 43 represents a mid-range level that has been declining from a peak near 100 in early January.

Forecasters 1 and 2 were clearly wrong about the baseline being at ~1. The value is in the mid-40s range, meaning there is substantial room for both increases AND decreases. The floor effect argument that made "Decreases" nearly impossible is invalid.

**Disagreement 2: Whether post-spike decay is ongoing or stabilized**

The research supports that significant events are STILL happening related to Venezuela:
- Feb 12: US Energy Secretary Chris Wright visited Venezuela (first cabinet-level visit)
- Feb 15: US military boarded a second oil tanker (Veronica III) in the Indian Ocean
- Feb 17: Reports that US military used Anthropic's AI model Claude in the Venezuela raid
- Ongoing sanctions developments (OFAC GL46, oil industry privatization)

This suggests interest has NOT fully stabilized at a floor. There is ongoing news flow that could sustain or even boost interest. However, the trend has been generally declining from the January peak, with the question noting the value is 43 (mid-range, not at peak).

**Disagreement 3: Probability of news-driven spike**

The research shows there is active, ongoing news about Venezuela (tanker seizures, energy secretary visit, AI usage revelations, sanctions developments, Iran parallels). This is NOT a quiet period. The Feb 15 tanker boarding and Feb 17 AI revelation are fresh stories that could drive searches. This supports a somewhat higher probability of "Increases" than the most conservative forecasters suggested.

Updated Analysis:

Given that the baseline is ~43 (not ~1), the analysis changes significantly:

1. **Decreases** is much more plausible than forecasters 1-3 suggested. Post-spike decay is a real phenomenon, and the value has been declining. However, ongoing news events (tanker seizures, energy secretary visit) may slow or arrest this decline.

2. **Increases** is possible given active news flow (tanker boarding Feb 15, AI revelation Feb 17, ongoing sanctions/oil developments). But the general trend is downward from the January spike.

3. **Doesn't change** (within ±3) is still the most likely single outcome for any given 10-day window, but less dominant than if the value were at the floor.

The resolution URL uses Jan 28 - Feb 27 as the date range. Within this window, the peak was likely around Jan 28-early Feb (still elevated from the Jan 3 raid), and values have been declining. The Feb 17 value and Feb 27 value will be measured relative to this window's peak.

Key consideration: With a value around 43 and active but declining news, the most likely scenario is modest continued decline or stability. The ongoing news flow (tanker seizures, oil developments) provides some support against further decline, but the general post-crisis decay pattern favors gradual decrease.

I'll weight this closer to forecasters 4 and 5's analysis, which correctly identified the mid-40s baseline and post-spike dynamics. The weighted average of [15.2, 70.0, 14.8] underweights "Decreases" because it's heavily influenced by forecasters 1-2 who had the wrong baseline. I should shift probability from "Doesn't change" toward "Decreases" while keeping "Increases" roughly where it is given active news flow.

Confidence: HIGH

The research clearly resolved the most critical factual disagreement (baseline value ~43, not ~1) and confirmed ongoing news events that affect the forecast. Forecasters 4 and 5 had the correct factual basis.

Probabilities: [14, 62, 24]
