6. **US Political Criticism:**
   - Democrats introduced the Venezuela Oil Proceeds Transparency Act on Wednesday to force a nonpartisan audit of oil proceeds.
   - Senator Adam Schiff criticized Trump's operations as being "about seizing Venezuela's oil and lining the pockets of the oil industry."

Query: Please check the Google Trends page at https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=venezuela&date=2026-01-28%202026-02-27 and report what the current daily values are for the most recent available dates (around Feb 14-17, 2026). Also check https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=venezuela&date=2026-01-17%202026-02-16 and report the daily values for the last two weeks. Is the trend stable, declining, or rising? What was the approximate peak value and when did it occur?
The material returned by the searches is wide-ranging political and economic reporting about events in – and affecting – Venezuela, but it does not include the numerical Google Trends “interest-over-time” values that the question requires. None of the articles, blogs, or data-wrapper sites captured in the search results reproduces the Google Trends daily-index numbers for the term “venezuela” for either of the two specified date windows (2026-01-28 → 2026-02-27 and 2026-01-17 → 2026-02-16). Nor is there a working link to a CSV export of those data, a screen-shot, or a paraphrased list of values.

Consequently:

1. Current daily values for 14–17 Feb 2026 (in the 28 Jan → 27 Feb window) cannot be reported from the information retrieved.

2. Daily values for the last two weeks of the 17 Jan → 16 Feb window likewise remain unavailable.

3. Because the underlying numbers are missing, it is impossible to judge with confidence whether the trend in U.S. search interest for “venezuela” is rising, stable, or declining, or to pinpoint the peak day and its index value.

Information gap:
The critical gap is the absence of the Google Trends numerical series itself. To close it, an export (CSV) or a direct visual read-off of the “Interest over time” plot for the two URLs below is required:
• https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=venezuela&date=2026-01-28%202026-02-27  
• https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=venezuela&date=2026-01-17%202026-02-16  

Without that data, none of the specific quantitative questions posed in the original query can be answered. New searches that target a CSV export or cached copies of the Google Trends charts are therefore necessary.</Agent_report>

# Summary of Article: "US boards second oil tanker in Indian Ocean after it fled Venezuelan raid"

**Source:** The Guardian  
**Date:** February 15, 2026

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Vessel Details:** US military forces boarded the Veronica III, a sanctioned tanker, in the Indian Ocean after tracking it from the Caribbean Sea.

2. **Cargo:** The Veronica III left Venezuela on January 3, 2026 (the same day as Maduro's capture) carrying nearly 2 million barrels of crude and fuel oil.

3. **Vessel History:** According to Tanker Trackers.com, the Veronica III has been involved with Russian, Iranian, and Venezuelan oil since 2023.

4. **Vessel Status:** The Veronica III is a Panamanian-flagged vessel under US sanctions related to Iran, according to the Treasury Department's Office of Foreign Assets Control.

5. **Fleet Movement:** At least 16 tankers left the Venezuelan coast in contravention of the quarantine, according to Tanker Trackers.com using satellite imagery and surface-level photos.

6. **Previous Action:** Last week, the US military boarded a different tanker in the Indian Ocean, the Aquila II, which was being held while its fate was decided.

## Context:

- Venezuela has faced US sanctions on its oil for several years, relying on a "shadow fleet" of falsely flagged tankers to smuggle crude into global supply chains.

- Maduro was apprehended in January during a US military operation.
- Several tankers fled the Venezuelan coast after the raid.

- **Pentagon (via X post):** "The vessel tried to defy President Trump's quarantine – hoping to slip away. We tracked it from the Caribbean to the Indian Ocean, closed the distance, and shut it down."

- **Tanker Trackers.com (organization):** Provided tracking data and historical information about the vessel's involvement with Russian, Iranian, and Venezuelan oil.

- **Samir Madani (co-founder of Tanker Trackers.com):** Told the Associated Press in January that his organization documented at least 16 tankers leaving the Venezuelan coast in contravention of the quarantine.

## Unresolved Information:

- The Pentagon did not confirm whether the Veronica III was formally seized and placed under US control, stating it had no additional information beyond its post.
