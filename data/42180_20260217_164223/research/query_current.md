Analysis:
To forecast whether U.S. Google search interest in “venezuela” will shift by more than three points in the next ten days, I need to know if any high-salience events concerning Venezuela are scheduled or likely to erupt during 17–27 Feb 2026. Drivers could include: political milestones (election timetable, opposition primaries, Essequibo referendum follow-ups), U.S. policy moves (sanctions snap-back, TPS updates), migration surges, oil-market deals, or security flare-ups with Guyana. Current news and calendars will reveal whether major announcements, negotiations, protests, or crises are imminent and therefore capable of materially boosting or depressing U.S. search volume.
