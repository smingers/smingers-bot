Analysis:
The term “venezuela” usually spikes in U.S. Google searches when 1) major political developments (elections, protests, coup rumors, U.S. sanctions decisions), 2) large‐scale humanitarian/crisis stories (blackouts, migration surges), 3) oil-market headlines (OPEC+, Chevron licenses) or 4) high-profile sporting events (World Cup qualifiers, Copa América matches) occur.  
To gauge the likelihood of the daily Trends value moving by more than three points in the next ten days, it helps to know:  
• Whether any scheduled or likely news catalysts fall between 17–27 Feb 2026 (e.g., court rulings on the 2024 contested election, new U.S. sanctions certification deadline, an IMF or OPEC meeting, migrant policy changes, or a high-visibility sports fixture).  
• How volatile the “venezuela” series has been in the last 90 days and what magnitude of change is typical after similar catalysts.  
• Historical precedents: what happened to the Trends value during comparable ten-day windows surrounding past events.
