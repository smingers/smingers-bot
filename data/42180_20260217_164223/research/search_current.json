Despite the calm appearance, market signals suggest potential monetary tightening. JP Tactical Trading noted that the opening aligns closely with the previous close. Globally, the U.S. dollar remains strong, with the DXY index at 97.28 (+0.38%), providing stability that has prevented sharp movements in the Colombian peso. Crude oil prices showed divergence: Brent fell 0.83% to $68.08 per barrel, while WTI rose 0.56% to $63.09. Investors are assessing global supply risks amid ongoing nuclear talks between the U.S. and Iran. The latest Banco de la Rep\u00fablica survey of expectations has raised alarm, with analysts projecting a 75 basis point interest rate hike\u2014potentially increasing the rate from 10.25% to 11%\u2014if confirmed. This tightening is driven by persistent inflation, with the February IPC projected at 5.76% annually, the highest level since late 2024. Official data will be released on March 6, but market pressure for aggressive action is mounting. In the U.S., key economic indicators are expected this week, including the ADP employment report, NAHB housing index, and New York Fed manufacturing survey. The market also awaits the FED\u2019s minutes (Wednesday) and the PCE price index (Friday), the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge. However, the article contains a factual error: it states that 'President Donald Trump confirmed that the dictator was captured and extracted from Venezuela on the morning of January 3, 2026,' which is impossible, as Donald Trump was not president in 2026 and no such event occurred. This statement contradicts known facts and is not supported by any credible source within the text. Therefore, the claim is invalid and cannot be attributed as factual within the scope of this analysis.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 03:16 PM\nSource:[PULZO](https://www.pulzo.com/economia/dolar-amanecio-con-leve-cambio-espera-crucial-dato-banco-republica-PP5051264A)\n\n**Venezuelan Housing Prices Surge Amid Expatriate Interest After Maduro's Arrest**\nFollowing the arrest of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on January 3, 2024, there has been a surge in interest among Venezuelan expatriates in purchasing property in their home country, according to real estate agents and market observers. Carlos Pe\u00f1alver, a Venezuelan electrician who emigrated to the U.S. four years ago, recently bought a three-bedroom apartment in Puerto Ordaz, reflecting a broader shift in sentiment. Although no official data track the real estate market post-Maduro, interviews with over a dozen real estate agents, industry leaders, and potential buyers indicate a noticeable market shift, with property prices rising 20% to 50% in some areas. In Ciudad Guayana, a home priced at $55,000 two years ago now lists for $85,000, attributed solely to Maduro\u2019s detention. Many sellers are pausing listings, waiting for clearer economic signals. Despite optimism fueled by new legislation aimed at attracting foreign investment in the oil sector, foreign companies remain cautious due to past expropriations. Market participants warn that current price increases are driven more by emotional expectations than rational economic fundamentals. The housing market, previously frozen due to hyperinflation, lack of long-term loans, and widespread expropriations, remains largely inaccessible to local Venezuelans due to inflated prices. In Cuman\u00e1, about 80% of listings are paused, and in Margarita Island, 80% of inquiries come from abroad. Agents stress that market recovery will take time, cautioning sellers not to overreact to short-term euphoria. 'These processes take time,' said Diogelis Pocaterra, a real estate agent in Ciudad Guayana, 'and that is what we must explain to owners swept up by news and emotion.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 01:24 PM\nSource:[Clarin](https://www.clarin.com/new-york-times-international-weekly/precios-vivienda-venezuela-disparan-posibilidad-compra-parte-emigrantes_0_j46CKV0ePZ.html)\n\n**\u00bfQuo Vadis Venezuela? The Geopolitical and Institutional Challenge of Reviving Its Oil Industry**\nVenezuela faces profound uncertainty amid shifting geopolitical dynamics and efforts to revive its oil industry. According to a Venezuelan friend, 'the country has changed completely, our history has changed.' The U.S. government\u2019s interest in Venezuela\u2019s oil reserves is driven more by geopolitical strategy\u2014limiting Chinese and Russian access\u2014than purely economic motives. U.S. oil companies remain cautious, adopting a 'wait-and-see' approach, prioritizing opportunities in Guyana, Brazil\u2019s pre-salt fields, and Argentina\u2019s Vaca Muerta, with project viability tied to global oil prices. Venezuela\u2019s oil production has declined from 3.4 million barrels per day under the Chavismo era to under 1 million today, a drop attributed to decades of decline, accelerated by political and institutional deterioration. Recent reforms to the Organic Hydrocarbons Law, published on January 29, 2026, eliminate distorting taxes, cap royalties, expand private sector participation, and allow operational control of fields by private firms\u2014though the state still retains majority ownership and veto power in key decisions. Arbitration is now permitted as a dispute resolution mechanism, though enforceability remains uncertain due to Venezuela\u2019s 2012 withdrawal from the ICSID Convention and lack of re-entry. The U.S. OFAC has issued licenses enabling crude sales and contingent investments in exploration and production, provided payments are routed through designated U.S.-managed accounts for royalties and debt repayment. Despite these steps, deep institutional challenges remain: long-term stability, regulatory and fiscal certainty, contract enforcement, respect for acquired rights, and an independent judiciary are essential for investor confidence. While political consensus on rebuilding the oil sector exists, institutional reconstruction\u2014requiring broad societal agreement\u2014must precede meaningful investment. Without it, surface-level risks and systemic fragility will persist. As one observer notes, 'the history has changed. Hopefully, it will change for the better.'\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 12:39 PM\nSource:[La Nacion](https://www.lanacion.com.ar/opinion/quo-vadis-venezuela-nid17022026/)\n\n**Venezuela Reemerges as Fifth-Largest Oil Supplier to the United States Amid Renewed Energy Ties**\nVenezuela became the fifth-largest supplier of crude oil to U.S. refineries during the first week of February 2026, the first time since December of the previous year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA). Despite a 13% decline in total exports\u2014153,000 barrels per day compared to the previous seven days\u2014the volume was sufficient to surpass traditional competitors and reestablish Venezuela as a key energy partner for Washington. The EIA reported a four-week moving average of 131,000 barrels per day, the highest level recorded in 2026. This recovery trend follows a political and commercial shift formalized on January 3, 2026, which included a commitment to sell up to 50 million barrels over the new cycle and the granting of licenses enabling direct investment and unrestricted crude exports to the U.S. Additionally, updated hydrocarbon laws have facilitated greater foreign and private sector participation. Venezuela\u2019s crude, particularly heavy oil from the Orinoco Belt, is well-suited to Gulf Coast refineries. However, experts note that current output remains far below historical potential: the first five weeks of 2026 averaged 58% less than the same period in 2025 and only a fraction of the 1.388 million barrels per day peak reached in January 2011. While the resurgence marks a tangible improvement, the recovery remains gradual relative to Venezuela\u2019s full production capacity and international market integration goals.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 11:54 AM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/venezuela/2026/02/17/venezuela-se-convirtio-en-el-quinto-proveedor-de-petroleo-a-estados-unidos-tras-la-caida-de-maduro/)\n\n**'Planificar, planificar, planificar': Experts Urge Strategic Planning for Businesses Targeting Venezuela's Emerging Opportunities**\nFollowing the January 3, 2024 capture of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro by U.S. authorities, Venezuela has begun a political and economic transformation. Experts emphasize 'planning, planning, planning' as key for companies seeking to capitalize on emerging opportunities. The Colombian-Venezuelan trade relationship, which had declined from over $7.2 billion in the early 2000s to $200 million due to political tensions and border restrictions, is rebounding: projections indicate bilateral trade could exceed $1.5 billion in 2024 and surpass $1.2 billion in 2025. Economic growth is anticipated, with some local economists forecasting a 12% GDP increase in 2024, driven by a projected 14% recovery in consumption. The oil sector is expected to see revenues grow by 50% to 100% year-on-year, depending on production stability and sanctions relief. A key reform\u2014the updated Organic Hydrocarbons Law, published in the Official Gazette on January 29, 2024\u2014now allows greater private sector participation in oil and gas, particularly associated gas, marking a significant shift from prior state-dominated models. Carlos Felce of Baker McKenzie notes that U.S. OFAC sanctions target the Venezuelan government and state entities like PDVSA, but not private actors, and that recent general licenses have facilitated U.S. business engagement with state firms. Felce stresses that investors must closely monitor pending and enacted legislation, conduct legal due diligence, and implement risk-prevention strategies, including robust contracts. Sectors showing strong interest include oil, infrastructure, electricity, pharmaceuticals, retail, and mass consumption. Alejandro Mesa of Baker McKenzie Colombia highlights Colombia\u2019s geographic, cultural, and historical advantages, noting that many Venezuelan expatriates in Colombia are poised to return, creating unprecedented migration dynamics. He also identifies two investment opportunities: expansion by firms already present in Venezuela and the growing movement of people returning home. Despite U.S. President Donald Trump\u2019s statement that the U.S. will address Venezuela\u2019s market demands, Mesa affirms that the open border and existing investment present clear opportunities across multiple sectors.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 11:08 AM\nSource:[Semana.com   \u00daltimas Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo](https://www.semana.com/economia/macroeconomia/articulo/planificar-planificar-planificar-el-mantra-de-los-expertos-para-las-empresas-que-quieren-capitalizar-oportunidades-en-venezuela/202617/)\n\n**Venezuela's Housing Prices Rise Amid Political Shifts and Diaspora Interest**\nThe Venezuelan real estate market is showing signs of reactivation after years of stagnation, with property prices rising in several cities, driven primarily by interest from Venezuelans living abroad who are considering purchases amid shifting political expectations. According to a report by The New York Times in Espa\u00f1ol, this price increase\u2014ranging from 20% to 50% in some areas\u2014does not reflect a structural economic recovery but rather heightened expectations of political stability following the capture of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro. Since early 2026, real estate agents have reported a notable surge in inquiries and negotiations for properties that had remained unsold for years. In regions like Margarita, demand is largely from the diaspora, while foreign buyers remain limited. However, the market remains constrained by reduced supply, as many owners are withholding properties until political and economic clarity improves. For residents still in Venezuela, access to housing remains difficult due to prolonged economic crisis, widespread property vacancies, and severely diminished purchasing power. The current uptick is thus seen as a shift in sentiment rather than a full market revival, with long-term stability dependent on evolving political and economic conditions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 11:29 PM\nSource:[PULZO](https://www.pulzo.com/mundo/precios-viviendas-venezuela-suben-ofertas-desde-afuera-pais-PP5050362)\n\n**Venezuelan Housing Market Sees Surge in Interest After Maduro's Capture, But Prices and Uncertainty Persist**\nThe capture of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on January 3, 2024, has sparked renewed interest in purchasing real estate in Venezuela, particularly among expatriates. Carlos Pe\u00f1alver, a 26-year-old Venezuelan electrician who emigrated to the U.S. four years ago, described buying a three-bedroom apartment in Puerto Ordaz as 'lucky' after prices rose shortly after his purchase. Despite the lack of official data on the housing market since Maduro\u2019s removal, real estate agents across Venezuela report a surge in inquiries and a 20% to 50% increase in property prices in various regions, including Ciudad Guayana, where a house rose from $55,000 to $85,000. Many properties have been pulled from the market by owners awaiting clearer economic signals. Agents note that 'opportunity properties'\u2014once affordable homes with desirable features\u2014have nearly disappeared. In Cuman\u00e1, about 80% of listings are paused, and buyers complain of inflated prices. In Margarita Island, around 80% of current inquiries come from Venezuelans abroad, with limited foreign interest. Economists like Asdr\u00fabal Oliveros attribute the shift to 'expectations of change,' while Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez of the Venezuelan Real Estate Chamber cautions that 'perceptions are emotional, not rational,' and warns that economic improvements will take years. The market remains constrained by past hyperinflation, collapsed banking credit, and widespread expropriations under socialist policies, leaving most locals unable to afford housing despite rising prices. 'The instability of the country makes one unable to plan,' said 42-year-old administrator Luisa Rojas, who dreams of moving but cannot afford it.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 11:11 PM\nSource:[infobae](https://www.infobae.com/america/the-new-york-times/2026/02/16/aumentan-los-precios-de-las-viviendas-en-venezuela-a-medida-que-quienes-emigraron-consideran-comprar/)\n\n**Venezuelan housing prices jump as emigres consider buying**\nVenezuelan housing prices have surged amid rising interest from expatriates considering property purchases following the detention of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on January 3, 2026.

Real estate agents across Venezuela report a sharp increase in inquiries, with property prices rising 20% to as much as 50% in some regions. In Ciudad Guayana, a townhouse increased from $55,000 to $85,000 solely due to Maduro\u2019s detention. Many listings have been pulled from the market as owners wait for clearer economic signals. Brokers like Diogelis Pocaterra and Adriana Rodr\u00edguez report that 'opportunity deals'\u2014once common at fire-sale prices\u2014have vanished. In Cuman\u00e1, about 80% of listings are paused, and in tourist areas like Margarita Island, 80% of inquiries come from Venezuelans abroad. Economists like Asdr\u00fabal Oliveros note that current price hikes are driven by expectations of political and economic change, not immediate fundamentals. Pablo Gonz\u00e1lez of the Venezuelan Real Estate Chamber warns that many buyers act on emotion rather than rational analysis. Despite optimism fueled by new oil sector rules aimed at attracting foreign investment, foreign companies remain cautious due to past expropriations, and significant economic recovery is expected to take years. For many Venezuelans still in the country, such as 42-year-old administrator Luisa Rojas, rising prices make homeownership unaffordable.

Operationally, the Urdaneta Oeste field, operated by Petroregional del Lago (PRDL) and in which M&P Iberoamerica holds a 40% working interest, is performing satisfactorily, with gross production averaging approximately 21,000 barrels of oil per day (bopd) in January 2026\u20148,400 bopd net to M&P Iberoamerica. The company\u2019s teams are prepared to initiate the next phase of field redevelopment once the regulatory and commercial framework is established. M&P also welcomes Venezuela\u2019s recent reform of its hydrocarbons framework and associated fiscal terms, which are expected to accelerate development, enhance operational autonomy, and attract investment. The Group believes a stable and predictable environment will unlock value for all stakeholders.

Trump stated that the United States and Venezuela are now in close cooperation and noted that major American oil companies have already begun operations in Venezuela, with expected significant economic benefits for Venezuela. This follows a large-scale military operation by the U.S. on January 3, 2026, during which U.S. forces seized Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, transporting them to the United States. After the operation, Trump announced that the U.S. would temporarily 'manage' Venezuela to ensure a smooth transition and allow American oil companies to invest in the country.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 02:44 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u534e\u7f51\u79d1\u6280\u516c\u53f8](https://news.china.com/socialgd/10000169/20260216/49254751.html)\n\n**Rising Foreign Interest in Venezuela's Real Estate Market After Maduro's Removal**\nFollowing the removal of Nicol\u00e1s Maduro on January 3, 2026, interest in Venezuela's real estate market has surged, particularly from international investors in Spain, the United States, and Chile. A Venezuelan resident in Chile reported that a land parcel in Hatillo, Caracas, rose from US$70,000 to US$80,000 within days. Industry sources indicate a 20% average increase in land values across Venezuela in just a few days. With no official statistics from the Central Bank of Venezuela, real estate firms Remax and Century21 serve as the primary indicators of market trends. Despite a 75% average decline in property prices over the past 20 years, current demand is driven by the perceived stability of basic services\u2014such as water, electricity, and fiber-optic internet\u2014now considered a 'Sant\u00edsima Trinidad' of value. In Isla Margarita, property prices range from US$500 to US$800 per square meter, significantly below construction costs and Caribbean averages. In Caracas, Campoalegre's prices have dropped from US$7,000\u20138,000 per square meter at the peak to a 2025 average of US$2,200\u20134,000. Remax brokers report a 660% increase in website traffic and a surge in inquiries, especially from Latin Americans and Dubai-based investors. Key areas of interest include Guacuco, Porlamar, Ranchos de Chana, El Yaque, Playa Moreno, and Pampatar. Despite cautious optimism, experts like Miguel Vegas (Remax franchise owner) note that while sentiment is shifting, it's too early to confirm long-term trends. Some properties are being delisted to await further developments, and transaction volumes have already increased, with five deals closed in one week. The market remains speculative, with investors described as 'the brave' due to the country\u2019s ongoing political transition.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 11, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[Diario Financiero](https://www.df.cl/df-mas/por-dentro/llamados-desde-dubai-espana-y-estados-unidos-crece-el-interes)\n\n**Dollar Rises on U.S. Invasion of Venezuela; Oil Markets React as Maduro Is Arrested**\nOn Monday, January 5, 2026, the U.S. dollar opened higher in trading, rising 0.13% to R$ 5.431 at 9:06 a.m., following the U.S. military invasion of Venezuela on Saturday, January 3, which resulted in the arrest of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores. The U.S. government accused Maduro of drug trafficking and terrorism, and he was set to appear before the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Manhattan on Monday to be formally notified of the charges. In a statement, former President Donald Trump announced that the U.S. would govern Venezuela until a transition, and that American companies would oversee oil extraction. Venezuela, home to the world\u2019s largest oil reserves and a founding member of OPEC, has seen its oil industry severely degraded, now producing less than 1% of global output. The arrest caused oil prices to drop up to 1.2% in Asian markets on Sunday, January 4. According to former ANP director David Zylbersztajn, the arrest may increase global oil supply, as Trump stated that oil would 'flow again' under American-led operations. U.S. Secretary of State Marco Rubio said the U.S. would use its influence over Venezuelan oil to push for further political changes. The country\u2019s oil infrastructure remained intact despite the attacks. Venezuela\u2019s oil exports account for about 90% of its total exports, with China as the primary buyer. The dollar had closed Friday, January 2, 2026, at R$ 5.4198, down 1.24% amid low liquidity due to year-end holidays. Investors are awaiting the release of December IPCA inflation data and U.S. labor market figures on Friday, January 9, as well as the upcoming appointment of Jerome Powell\u2019s successor at the Federal Reserve. In 2025, the U.S. dollar fell 11.19%, its largest annual drop since 2016, while Brazil\u2019s Ibovespa rose 33.7%, its best performance since 2016, driven by strong foreign capital inflows. This trend was fueled by the Federal Reserve\u2019s reduction of U.S. interest rates from 4.25%-4.5% to 3.5%-3.75% in 2025.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 05, 2026 12:55 PM\nSource:[Folha de S.Paulo](https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/mercado/2026/01/dolar-abre-em-alta-apos-ataque-dos-eua-a-venezuela.shtml)\n\n**S&P and Nasdaq Futures Rise After Venezuela Developments**\nU.S. stock index futures indicated a positive start to the first full trading week of 2026, driven by geopolitical developments in Venezuela. As of 14:42 MSK, the Dow Jones Industrial Average futures were nearly unchanged, while S&P 500 futures rose 21 points (0.3%) and Nasdaq 100 futures gained 175 points (0.7%). The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average posted modest gains on Friday, ending a four-day losing streak, supported by strong performances from semiconductor giants Nvidia and Intel. All three major Wall Street indices posted double-digit gains in 2025, marking the third consecutive year of growth\u2014matching the 2019\u20132021 period. Oil prices fluctuated after the U.S. seized Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro over the weekend, claiming temporary control of the country. Brent crude futures rose 0.1% to $60.81 per barrel, and West Texas Intermediate (WTI) futures climbed 0.2% to $57.44, reversing earlier declines. Oil prices had fallen over 18% in 2025\u2014the worst decline in five years\u2014due to concerns over oversupply and weakening demand. U.S. forces detained Maduro on suspicion of drug trafficking, and President Donald Trump announced that Washington would administer Venezuela until a new leader is elected, allowing major U.S. oil companies to enter the country. Venezuelan oil reserves are the largest in the world, but production has declined due to outdated infrastructure and U.S. sanctions. Analysts at ING noted that the potential regime change in Venezuela has introduced uncertainty, boosting the appeal of U.S. dollar liquidity. Trump also hinted at a possible second military strike if the interim government resists cooperation, and mentioned potential actions against Colombia over drug trafficking and Cuba\u2019s vulnerability. He reaffirmed U.S. interest in Greenland for national security. Meanwhile, upcoming U.S. employment data for December is expected to show around 57,000 new jobs, down from 64,000 in November. The October jobs report was the first in over 75 years to omit the unemployment rate due to a 43-day government shutdown. The Federal Reserve lowered interest rates at each of its last three 2025 meetings, prioritizing labor market weakness over inflation concerns. The rate-cutting outlook has supported equities, though Fed officials remain divided on the path for 2026. The ISM Manufacturing PMI for December is expected to rise slightly to 48.3 from 48.2, remaining in contraction territory (below 50), with prices paid by manufacturers expected to rise modestly.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 05, 2026 11:54 AM\nSource:[Investing.com \u0420\u043e\u0441\u0441\u0438\u044f](https://ru.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/article-3052169)\n\n**CNBC Daily Open: Investors had much to cheer in 2025  --  but 2026's starting out rocky**\nIn 2025, global financial markets saw strong performance, led by a 16.39% rally in the S&P 500, driven largely by enthusiasm over artificial intelligence. Among major stocks, Alphabet (Google's parent company) emerged as the top performer within the 'Magnificent Seven' group. Colombia's stock market led the MSCI All Country World Index, while silver surged over 141%, outpacing gold, which also delivered a strong year. However, early 2026 began with geopolitical tension: the U.S. launched an attack on Venezuela, sparking international concern. According to President Donald Trump, U.S. oil companies will invest in Venezuela\u2019s energy sector, though Petr\u00f3leos de Venezuela (PDVSA) still controls the majority of oil production and reserves. Analysts expect crude prices to remain stable in the near term. On the foreign policy front, experts believe the U.S. strike will not provoke China into similar actions regarding Taiwan. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen condemned the attack, urging the U.S. to 'stop the threats against a historically close ally and against another country and another people who have said very clearly that they are not for sale.' The situation remains fluid, with further updates pending as the U.S. provides additional information.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 05, 2026 07:30 AM\nSource:[CNBC](https://www.cnbc.com/2026/01/05/cnbc-daily-open-investors-had-much-to-cheer-in-2025-but-2026s-starting-out-rocky.html)\n\n**Institutional Forecast: Refined Oil Prices Likely to Remain Unchanged Tomorrow Night**\nThe National Development and Reform Commission's price adjustment window for domestic refined oil products will open on January 6, 2026, at 24:00. According to Longzhong Information, due to a weakening trend in international crude oil prices during the current cycle, the expected price increase is approximately 30 yuan per ton. Since this is below the 50 yuan per ton threshold for adjustments, a price change is unlikely, making the adjustment likely to be shelved. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) announced on January 4, 2026, that eight major OPEC+ member countries will maintain their 2025 November production plan and suspend additional output increases in February and March 2026, with flexibility to adjust production based on market conditions. Meanwhile, Venezuela\u2019s crude output has declined due to U.S. sanctions, with its state oil company implementing emergency measures to shut down some oilfields and wells. Analyst Liu Bingjuan from Longzhong Information noted that OPEC+'s decision to pause production in Q1 2026, along with ongoing geopolitical instability in the U.S., Venezuela, and Russia, continues to support oil prices. Demand remains strong in the short term due to the U.S. holiday season and cold winter weather, but long-term demand outlook is weak, with 'short-term strength, long-term weakness' characteristics. The Federal Reserve is not expected to cut interest rates in January 2026, reducing demand-side support. Analyst Xi Jiarui from Jinlianchuang said U.S. sanctions have temporarily excluded Venezuela from production decisions, forcing the country to shut down multiple wells and further reduce output. In the short term, escalating geopolitical tensions are likely to increase risk premiums and upward pressure on crude oil prices due to supply disruption fears. In the medium to long term, the U.S. actions may reflect strategic interest in Venezuela\u2019s vast oil reserves\u2014ranked first globally in proven reserves\u2014with potential future U.S. oil companies re-entering the country, increasing global supply. However, RapiDan Energy Consulting believes that even if one-third of Venezuela\u2019s crude output is at risk, total production will not halt, and the impact on the international market will be limited. Looking ahead, the next refined oil price adjustment window will open on January 20, 2026, at 24:00. Liu Bingjuan expects a higher probability of an upward adjustment due to sustained supply support from OPEC+\u2019s production pause and temporary demand boosts from Western holidays and winter weather.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 05, 2026 05:59 AM\nSource:[\u8bc1\u5238\u65f6\u62a5\u7f51_\u8bc1\u5238\u65f6\u62a5\u65d7\u4e0b\u8d44\u8baf\u5e73\u53f0_\u80a1\u7968_\u57fa\u91d1_\u671f\u8d27_\u503a\u5238_\u7406\u8d22_\u8d22\u7ecf_\u884c\u60c5_\u6570\u636e_\u80a1\u5427_\u535a\u5ba2_\u8bba\u575b](https://stcn.com/article/detail/3570586.html)\n\n**Global Market Outlook: Venezuela Crisis, U.S. Nonfarm Data, and CES 2026 Tech Showdown**\nThe week ahead in global markets features key events including the U.S. December nonfarm employment report, the CES 2026 consumer electronics show, and escalating geopolitical tensions following a U.S. military action against Venezuela. The S&P 500, which has struggled to break 7,000 since late October 2025, will likely see its first major market move of 2026 shaped by the U.S. jobs data. The Bureau of Labor Statistics' revised report showed a 64,000 gain in November employment, but a 105,000 loss in October\u2014the largest monthly decline since late 2020. A continued cooling in the U.S. labor market may prompt the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates more aggressively. The current federal funds rate is 3.5%\u20133.75%, with most officials viewing the neutral rate at around 3%, suggesting two more 25-basis-point cuts are possible. A key uncertainty is whether President Trump will announce the next Fed chair nominee in January, though the timing remains unclear. Outside the U.S., major economies will release a wave of PMI and CPI data: preliminary inflation figures for France and Germany on Tuesday, and eurozone data on Wednesday. These are unlikely to alter the European Central Bank\u2019s expectation of no rate cuts in the near term. In equities, the new earnings season begins with JPMorgan on January 13, but companies like Jefferies, Tilray, and Fast Retailing will report earlier. CES 2026, held from January 6 to 9 in Las Vegas, will feature keynote speeches by NVIDIA\u2019s Huang Renxun and AMD\u2019s Lisa Su on January 5 (China time). Major Asian tech firms\u2014Alibaba, Lenovo, Samsung Electronics, LG\u2014will showcase innovations including home robots, AI glasses, wearable devices, and new strategies for coping with rising memory prices. The debut of Intel\u2019s first '18A' chip, critical for its foundry business, is also expected. Geopolitically, the U.S. military action on Venezuela has escalated dramatically: on Saturday, the U.S. reportedly captured the plane carrying Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, en route to New York. Maduro was expected to appear in a U.S. federal court on January 5, though this may change. The move has drawn international condemnation and domestic scrutiny in the U.S., as President Trump acted without notifying Congress. The action violates Article 2, Paragraph 4 of the UN Charter, which prohibits the use of force against a nation\u2019s territorial integrity or political independence. The U.S. now faces dual pressure from global institutions and its own constitutional framework. Key events for the week (Beijing Time): Monday (Jan 5): South Korean President Yoon Suk-yeol visits China (Jan 4\u20137); Tuesday (Jan 6): Eurozone PMI, U.S. final Spiegel Global PMI, France/Germany CPI, CES 2026 begins; Wednesday (Jan 7): Eurozone CPI, U.S. ADP employment, U.S. JOLTs job openings; Thursday (Jan 8): U.S. October wholesale sales, U.S. October trade balance; Friday (Jan 9): China December CPI, U.S. December nonfarm employment report, Silicon Valley Auto Show opens.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 03, 2026 10:56 PM\nSource:[\u4e1c\u65b9\u8d22\u5bcc\u7f51](https://finance.eastmoney.com/a/202601043607762826.html)\n\n**Regime Change, Minimum Wage Hikes and AI Among the Forces Reshaping Investment in Latin America in 2026**\nIn early January 2026, a dramatic geopolitical event unfolded in Venezuela when President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro was captured by U.S. forces during a large-scale strike, according to a statement by former U.S. President Donald Trump on social media. Maduro and his wife were taken from a military base and flown to a U.S. warship, where they face criminal charges in New York for narco-terrorism conspiracy and drug importation. Trump announced the U.S. would temporarily administer Venezuela until a transition of power occurs, emphasizing plans for American oil companies to rebuild the country\u2019s oil infrastructure and extract significant wealth. The U.S. maintains that Venezuela\u2019s oil production and refining operations remained undamaged. The event has triggered regional concern, with Nicaragua and Cuba closely monitoring developments, and Colombia deploying security forces along its border. In Colombia, the government raised the 2026 minimum wage by 22.7% to 1.75 million Colombian pesos per month, affecting approximately 2.5 million workers, a move aimed at democratizing wealth but raising inflation concerns. Economic growth in Latin America is projected to be modest in 2026\u2014around 2.3% according to ECLAC, with low-to-mid single-digit growth forecast by the World Bank, driven by stable inflation and improved investment conditions. The region\u2019s mineral wealth, particularly in gold, silver, copper, lithium, and iron ore, is expected to support economic performance. Foreign investment has surged, especially in Mexico, where tech hubs like Guadalajara have attracted major firms including Meta, Google, Apple, Netflix, and Microsoft, creating over 150,000 jobs and concentrating 40% of Mexico\u2019s IT industry in Jalisco. Ecuador is also emerging as a tech hub, with Meridian expanding into the country in 2025. Venture capital is increasingly flowing into fintech and AI, with startups like Midi Financial, Leadsales, Fracttal, Credibl ESG, 360 Health Data, and Buddy.ai gaining traction. AI adoption is led by Chile, followed by Brazil and Uruguay, with national AI strategies being developed across the region. Investors face a complex landscape in 2026, balancing growth potential from natural resources and technology with heightened geopolitical risks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 03, 2026 10:47 PM\nSource:[Barchart.com](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/36873102/regime-change-minimum-wage-hikes-and-ai-among-the-forces-reshaping-investment-in-latin-america-in-2026)\n\n**Mundial de Clubes, AI and Local Language Trends Dominate Google Searches in Venezuela in 2025**\nAccording to Google Trends data for 2025, the most-searched topics in Venezuela were led by Banco de Venezuela (100), Patria (65), and Loter\u00eda (55), with consistent high search volumes throughout the year. The World Club Cup (Mundial de Clubes) ranked as the top trend with a search growth of over 3,300%, driven by global interest in the FIFA tournament and its connection to the 2026 Men\u2019s World Cup. The AI development Deepseek followed with a 2,750% increase, reflecting strong public interest in emerging artificial intelligence tools. Online gaming in Venezuela saw a 1,100% surge. Other high-growth topics included the UEFA Champions League (850%), the U.S. dollar (550%), Google\u2019s Gemini AI (400%), and the Banco Digital de los Trabajadores (BDT) (350%). Notably, viral cultural phenomena such as the 'tralalero tralala' meme (2,600% growth), the capybara (180% growth), and the term 'lech\u00fao' (2,550% growth) reflected local linguistic and internet trends. Search queries using 'qu\u00e9' and 'c\u00f3mo' revealed strong interest in definitions (e.g., 'Qu\u00e9 es inteligencia artificial' +40%), cultural terms (e.g., 'c\u00f3mo se dice taca\u00f1o en Venezuela' +1,900%), and DIY activities, with 'c\u00f3mo hacer un barco de papel' leading at 250% growth. These trends highlight Venezuela\u2019s focus on national institutions, digital technology, local language, and creative hobbies.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 12, 2025 09:37 PM\nSource:[\u00daltimas Noticias](https://ultimasnoticias.com.ve/datos-un/bdv-y-mundial-de-clubes-encabezaron-las-busquedas-de-google-en-venezuela-en-2025/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
