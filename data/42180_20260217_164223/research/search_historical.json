The government then began printing new money, leading to rapidly rising prices, increased unemployment, and GDP collapse, all exacerbated by international sanctions.\n\n- **Current situation:** Many Venezuelans are emigrating to find work and supplies elsewhere, and population growth is at a decade-low.\n\n## Opinion (Unnamed Source):\n\n- The article states that current president Nicol\u00e1s Maduro \"does not seem inclined to steer away from his course of price controls and economic mismanagement,\" and therefore \"the standard of living in the country is not expected to improve significantly anytime soon.\"\n\n**Note:** This opinion appears to be from Statista's editorial perspective rather than a named expert or specific source.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.tradingview.com/symbols/ECONOMICS-VEINTR/\">\n# Summary of Article: Venezuela Interest Rate Historical Data\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Current Interest Rate**: Venezuela's interest rate is 58.59% as of the time of the article\n2. **Recent Historical Data**:\n   - Last month: 58.59%\n   - Month before: 58.34%\n   - Last release observation period: December 2025\n3. **Historical Range**:\n   - Highest: 83.73% (February 15, 2002)\n   - Lowest: 12.79% (April 17, 2006)\n\n## Other Information:\n\n- The Central Bank of Venezuela (Banco Central de Venezuela, BCV) is noted as not being responsible for setting interest rates (though no further explanation is provided)\n- The article provides general definitions of interest rates and their economic effects, but no specific analysis or forecasts related to Venezuela\n\n## Note:\nThis article focuses on Venezuela's interest rate data and does not contain information directly relevant to predicting Google Trends search interest for \"venezuela\" between February 17-27, 2026.

Provide dates and a one-sentence description of each spike.\nMajor Venezuela-related events scheduled for the 10-day window 17 \u2013 27 February 2026  \n\n1. Carnival / Shrove Tuesday public holiday \u2013 Tuesday 17 Feb 2026  \n   \u2022 The long-standing national \u201cCarnaval\u201d break in Venezuela runs on the Monday\u2013Tuesday before Ash Wednesday and is the country\u2019s next public holiday after New Year\u2019s Day. (CalendarLabs, 2026 Venezuela Holidays).  \n   \u2022 Although the formal holiday is 16\u201317 Feb, carnival street parties, concerts and televised parades normally spill over into the evening of the 17th and in tourist centres can last several days (National Today, Venezuela Carnival background).  \n\nNo other nationally scheduled political, sporting or economic events were found for 18 \u2013 27 February 2026.  Venezuela\u2019s next nationwide events on published calendars are Maundy Thursday/Good Friday (2\u20133 Apr 2026) and several trail-running races in late March and April (Finishers event calendar), but nothing falls inside the 10-day interval in question.  Likewise, the country\u2019s next presidential and regional elections are not due until later in 2026\u201327, and no official debates or primaries are slated for mid-February (SIGLA Presidential Election Calendar; A-WEB electoral calendar).\n\nImplication for Google-Trends forecasting  \n\u2022 Because the only pre-announced national happening in the 17\u201327 Feb window is the second day of Carnival on 17 Feb, any change in U.S. Google search interest is more likely to be driven by unscheduled news (political crisis, U.S.\u2013Venezuela confrontation, major blackout, etc.) than by a diary event.  \n\u2022 Historical Google-Trends behaviour shows that routine holidays such as Carnival rarely create large U.S. search spikes by themselves; search peaks have instead occurred when Carnival coincided with political turmoil (e.g., February 2019, see below).  \n\nPast spikes in U.S. Google searches for \u201cVenezuela\u201d and the triggering events  \n(The dates below correspond to the day Google Trends usually shows the local maximum; each is accompanied by one-sentence context.  All events are of the same broad types\u2014political confrontation, nationwide blackout, or explosive military episode\u2014that could again happen without notice in February 2026.)\n\n1. 23 Feb 2019 \u2013 Aid-convoy clashes on the Colombia and Brazil borders  \n   Violent confrontations between opposition supporters attempting to bring humanitarian aid into Venezuela and security forces loyal to President Maduro killed at least four people and dominated international news. (Slate, 23 Feb 2019; TIME, 24 Feb 2019; Business Insider, 23 Feb 2019)\n\n2. 7 Mar 2019 \u2013 Start of the first nationwide blackout  \n   A massive failure at the Guri hydroelectric complex plunged all 23 Venezuelan states into darkness for five days, disrupting water, transport and hospitals and prompting global headlines. (CNN, 23 Jul 2019 retrospect; Borgen Project, 5 Feb 2021)\n\n3. 23\u201325 Mar 2019 \u2013 Second and third nationwide blackouts  \n   Repeated grid collapses later in March kept much of the country without electricity and again pushed \u201cVenezuela\u201d to the top of U.S. Google real-time trending searches. (CNN, 23 Jul 2019; Borgen Project, 5 Feb 2021)\n\n4. 3 Jan 2026 \u2013 Reports of explosions and U.S. military escalation near Caracas  \n   Loud blasts over the capital, smoke near a major base and statements from both the Maduro government and the White House sparked a surge of U.S. searches, with multiple outlets noting \u201cVenezuela\u201d was trending on Google that day. (Times Now News, 3 Jan 2026)\n\n5. 30 Aug 2024 \u2013 Nation-wide blackout amid post-election tension  \n   A dawn power failure that the government called \u201celectrical sabotage\u201d left all 24 states partly or fully without electricity, feeding fears of unrest after the disputed 28 July 2024 election and driving a fresh spike in search interest. (Al Jazeera, 30 Aug 2024)\n\n6. 23 Jul 2019 \u2013 Fourth 2019 nationwide blackout (\u201celectromagnetic attack\u201d claim)  \n   Power again failed across most of Venezuela, with officials alleging an \u201celectromagnetic attack\u201d and ordering work stoppages, drawing another round of intense international attention. (CNN, 23 Jul 2019)\n\nWhy these comparators matter for 17\u201327 Feb 2026  \n\u2022 Three of the historical spikes (items 1, 2, 3) took place in late February or March and began just days after Carnival celebrations, showing that routine holiday coverage alone is not enough to cause U.S. interest surges, but that the same period can become extremely news-sensitive when coupled with political flashpoints or infrastructure failures.  \n\u2022 Item 4 (Jan 2026) demonstrates that sudden U.S.\u2013Venezuela military incidents still produce immediate Google-trends spikes, indicating that a similar unplanned escalation\u2014even if rumours only\u2014during the forecast window would likely lift the 27 Feb value well above the 17 Feb baseline.  \n\u2022 Items 2, 3, 5, 6 underline that large-scale power outages\u2014typically unpredictable\u2014have repeatedly pushed \u201cVenezuela\u201d searches above normal levels and could do so again without warning.\n\nInformation gaps  \nNo authoritative source yet lists any governmental, judicial or sporting event inside 18 \u2013 27 Feb 2026 that might systematically move U.S. search interest.  Continuous monitoring of unscheduled developments (e.g., electricity grid stability, U.S.\u2013Venezuela military posture, opposition activity) is therefore essential to assess the likelihood of a trend change between 17 Feb and 27 Feb 2026.</Agent_report>\n\n<GoogleTrendsData term=\"venezuela\">\nGoogle Trends US data for \"venezuela\" (last 90 days):\n\nCurrent value: 1\n90-day mean: 4.4\n90-day std dev: 12.1\n\nBASE RATE ANALYSIS (using 10-day windows to match question timeframe):\n- In 75% of 10-day windows, the value changed by \u22643 points (\"Doesn't change\")\n- In 12% of 10-day windows, the value INCREASED by >3 points\n- In 12% of 10-day windows, the value DECREASED by >3 points\n\nRecent trend: stable (last 7 days avg: 1.0 vs prior 7 days: 1.0)\n\nDAILY VALUES (last 30 days):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-19,2\n2026-01-20,2\n2026-01-21,2\n2026-01-22,2\n2026-01-23,2\n2026-01-24,2\n2026-01-25,2\n2026-01-26,2\n2026-01-27,2\n2026-01-28,2\n2026-01-29,2\n2026-01-30,2\n2026-01-31,2\n2026-02-01,2\n2026-02-02,2\n2026-02-03,1\n2026-02-04,1\n2026-02-05,1\n2026-02-06,1\n2026-02-07,1\n2026-02-08,1\n2026-02-09,1\n2026-02-10,1\n2026-02-11,1\n2026-02-12,1\n2026-02-13,1\n2026-02-14,1\n2026-02-15,1\n2026-02-16,1\n2026-02-17,1\n\nNote: Google Trends values are relative (0-100 scale), not absolute search volumes.\n</GoogleTrendsData>\n"
