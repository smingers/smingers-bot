Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles (February 5-17, 2026):**

1. **House Judiciary Committee (Feb 5)**: Official government announcement of Feb 11 hearing. Factual, high quality.

2. **Vermont Public (Feb 11)**: Factual reporting of hearing that occurred same day. High-quality journalism documenting Bondi's contentious testimony, Epstein files controversy, personal attacks on lawmakers. Key facts: hearing devolved into partisan brawl, Bondi called Raskin "washed-up loser lawyer," criticized for poor redactions exposing victims.

3. **WLRN (Feb 11)**: Corroborates Vermont Public account. Additional context on DOJ actions under Bondi's tenure (firings, prosecutions of Trump opponents). Factual reporting with named sources.

4. **Roll Call (Feb 10)**: Pre-hearing analysis published day before. Factual preview of expected controversies. Rep. Massie and Raskin quotes are factual statements from identifiable sources.

5. **KARE11 (date unclear, but references "Wednesday")**: Reports Bondi's presence in Minneapolis announcing protester arrests. Factual but lacks specific date context relative to Feb 17.

6. **Chicago Tribune (Feb 7)**: Reports on Gabbard-Bondi controversy regarding Georgia FBI search. Multiple named sources (Reps. Himes, Warner). Factual reporting of conflicting explanations.

**AskNews Articles:**

Most AskNews articles are irrelevant (Indian stock markets, bond markets, Procter & Gamble options, Indonesian mining stocks, etc.). Relevant articles:

1. **"GOP warned more 'defections' imminent"** (Feb 17): Reports Rep. Massie's criticism of Bondi's Feb 11 hearing performance. Quotes Massie saying "more defections" likely, DOJ released comprehensive Epstein names list over weekend (Feb 15-16). This is current, relevant news from identifiable source.

2. **"Pam Bondi Shows Loyalty to her Audience of One"** (Feb 16): Opinion piece criticizing Bondi's Feb 11 hearing conduct. Contains factual elements (Bondi called Raskin "washed-up loser," defended stock market performance) but primarily opinion/analysis.

3. **"I Tried the Pam Bondi Approach"** (Feb 13): Satirical piece. Not factual news.

4. **"Luigi Mangione's lawyers"** (Dec 20, 2025): Old news about conflict of interest allegations. Pre-dates prediction window.

5. **"Gold Wavers"** (Nov 18, 2025): Mentions Lisa Cook/Bondi legal case tangentially. Old, not directly relevant.

6. **"Google refuses to bow"** (Nov 15, 2025): Mentions Bondi calling antitrust case "landmark victory." Old news.

7. **"Pam Bondi Says Meta Removed Facebook Page"** (Oct 15, 2025): Old news about ICE agent doxxing. Not relevant to Feb 17-28 window.

**Key factual developments since Feb 17:**
- Feb 11: Contentious hearing (well-documented, multiple sources)
- Feb 15-16: DOJ released comprehensive Epstein names list (per AskNews Feb 17 article)
- Feb 17: Rep. Massie predicts "more defections," criticizes Bondi's performance
- No scheduled events Feb 17-28 (per outside view agent report)

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Established decay pattern**: Multiple data points show 100→60→33→23→18→13 over 5 days (Feb 12-17). This is objective Google Trends data showing clear downward momentum.
- **No scheduled events**: Agent report systematically searched for Feb 17-28 events and found none. This is strong negative evidence against "Increases."
- **Mean reversion pressure**: 90-day mean of 5.5 vs. current 13 represents 2.4× elevation, creating strong gravitational pull downward.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Weekend Epstein list release (Feb 15-16)**: The AskNews article from Feb 17 mentions DOJ released comprehensive Epstein names list "over the weekend." This is a new development that could sustain some residual interest, but the article also notes it "failed to clarify the investigation and instead intensified backlash." This is a moderate factor that might slow decay slightly but unlikely to reverse it.
- **Massie's "more defections" comment (Feb 17)**: Rep. Massie predicting GOP defections is newsworthy but represents continued fallout from Feb 11 hearing, not a new spike trigger. Moderate evidence for sustained interest at current levels.
- **Historical base rate**: 84% of 11-day windows show ≤3 point change, but this includes periods starting from baseline. Moderate evidence for stability, but context-dependent.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Feb 20 Supreme Court conference**: Vincent v. Bondi case is administrative, unlikely to generate news coverage. Very weak evidence.
- **Ongoing DOJ controversies**: General pattern of controversial actions, but no specific scheduled events. Weak evidence for sustained interest.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 11 days (Feb 17 → Feb 28, 2026)

**Current position**: Starting at 13 on Feb 17, in active decay from Feb 12 peak of 100.

**If timeframe halved (5-6 days, Feb 17 → Feb 22-23):**
- Decay would have less time to reach baseline
- More likely to stay in 10-13 range
- "Doesn't change" probability would increase to ~40-45%
- "Decreases" would drop to ~50%

**If timeframe doubled (22 days, Feb 17 → Mar 11):**
- Much more time for mean reversion to baseline (5.5)
- Almost certain to drop below 10
- "Decreases" probability would increase to ~80-85%
- "Doesn't change" would drop to ~10-12%

**Weekend effect**: Feb 17 is Monday. The 11-day window includes two full weekends (Feb 22-23, Mar 1-2 partially). News cycles typically slow on weekends, which could accelerate decay toward baseline.

## (d) Justification

**Key factors shifting from outside view:**

1. **Weekend Epstein list release (Feb 15-16)**: This is NEW information not captured in the outside view's decay analysis. The outside view assumed Feb 11 hearing was the last major event. However:
   - The AskNews article notes the release "failed to clarify" and "intensified backlash"
   - This suggests it's a continuation of the Feb 11 controversy, not a new spike trigger
   - It might slow decay from 13→10 over 11 days, but unlikely to prevent it entirely
   - **Impact**: Modest upward adjustment to "Doesn't change" (+5-8%), downward to "Decreases" (-5-8%)

2. **Massie's "more defections" comment (Feb 17)**: This extends the news cycle from Feb 11 hearing, but:
   - It's a single congressman's opinion, not a new event
   - Media coverage will likely be limited
   - It's a lagging indicator (discussing past hearing), not leading indicator
   - **Impact**: Small upward adjustment to "Doesn't change" (+2-3%)

3. **Decay momentum is very strong**: The 5-day pattern (100→13) shows average decline of 17.4 points/day initially, now ~1 point/day. Even if decay slows further to 0.3 points/day, that's still 3.3 points over 11 days, triggering "Decreases" resolution.

4. **No scheduled events remains decisive**: The absence of any scheduled hearings, media appearances, or public events for Feb 17-28 is the most important factor. Without new triggers, baseline is the natural attractor.

**Justification for shifts from outside view (Increases: 7%, Doesn't change: 28%, Decreases: 65%):**

- **Increases**: The weekend Epstein list release is the only potential upward catalyst, but it appears to be a continuation rather than new spike. Maintain 7% (no change).

- **Doesn't change**: The weekend release + Massie comments provide modest support for sustained interest in 10-13 range. However, the decay momentum is strong and 11 days is sufficient time for mean reversion. Adjust upward slightly to account for these factors: 28% → 33%.

- **Decreases**: The decay pattern remains dominant, but the weekend developments slightly reduce confidence that value will drop below 10. Adjust downward: 65% → 60%.

## Probability Calibration

**Status quo continuation**: If current decay rate (~1 point/day) continues, value reaches ~2 by Feb 28. This would clearly resolve "Decreases."

**Scenario analysis**:

1. **Decay continues at current rate** (60% probability): 13→2 by Feb 28. Resolution: "Decreases"

2. **Decay slows significantly due to weekend Epstein release** (30% probability): 13→10-11 by Feb 28. Resolution: "Doesn't change" (if 10-16) or "Decreases" (if <10)

3. **Unexpected event causes spike** (10% probability): Could include breaking Bondi news, new controversy, or external shock. Resolution: "Increases" (if >16) or "Doesn't change" (if 10-16)

**Calibration check**:
- 60% for "Decreases" means 3:2 odds, which feels appropriate given strong decay momentum but some uncertainty about exact rate
- 33% for "Doesn't change" means 1:2 odds against, which reflects the weekend developments providing some support
- 7% for "Increases" means 1:13 odds against, which reflects very low probability of unexpected event

**Blind spot**: The main risk is that the weekend Epstein list release generates more sustained media coverage than expected, or that Massie's "more defections" comment triggers additional GOP criticism that keeps Bondi in the news. However, even this scenario would more likely result in "Doesn't change" (value staying 10-13) rather than "Increases."

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Google Trends value for "pam bondi" on Feb 28 be >3 points higher (Increases), within ±3 points (Doesn't change), or >3 points lower (Decreases) than Feb 17 value of 13?

2. **Base rate**: Outside view was Increases: 7%, Doesn't change: 28%, Decreases: 65%. My inside view shifts this to 7%, 33%, 60% - modest adjustment based on weekend developments.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = Decreases (60%); Least likely = Increases (7%). This aligns with strong decay momentum, no scheduled events, and mean reversion pressure.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Strong decay pattern: 100→13 over 5 days
   - No scheduled events Feb 17-28 (agent report)
   - Weekend Epstein list release (Feb 15-16) provides modest support for sustained interest
   - Current value (13) is 2.4× above 90-day mean (5.5)
   - Massie predicts "more defections" (Feb 17)

5. **Blind spot**: Weekend Epstein release generates unexpectedly sustained media coverage, keeping value in 10-13 range. This would make "Doesn't change" correct and my 60% "Decreases" forecast look overconfident.

6. **Status quo**: Decay continuation is the status quo. The 11-day timeframe is sufficient for significant mean reversion. No adjustment needed.

7. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [7, 33, 60]
