Analysis:

(a) Source Analysis:

**Web Articles (February 5-11, 2026):**
All sources are high-quality mainstream news outlets (NBC News, AP News, CNN, WAMC) and official government sites (House Judiciary Committee) covering the same event: Pam Bondi's February 11, 2026 House Judiciary Committee hearing. These are factual reports of a past event (today is Feb 17), not speculative predictions.

Key factual elements consistently reported:
- The hearing occurred on Feb 11, 2026
- It was contentious, lasting ~4.5 hours
- Main topics: Epstein files mishandling, DOJ prosecutions, political tensions
- Bondi made combative statements and personal attacks
- A grand jury rejected DOJ's attempt to indict Democratic lawmakers (reported Feb 10)
- Epstein files were released with poor redactions exposing survivors' information

Opinions noted (from identifiable sources):
- Rep. Raskin: Bondi turned DOJ into "Trump's instrument of revenge"
- Rep. Jordan: DOJ has "returned to its core missions"
- CNN analyst Aaron Blake: Bondi was "playing to the 'audience of one' — Trump"
- Poll data: Americans disapprove 3-to-1 of Epstein files handling

**Agent Report (Feb 17, 2026):**
High-quality systematic search for scheduled events Feb 17-28. Key findings:
- NO confirmed media appearances, hearings, or public events scheduled
- Only a low-profile Supreme Court conference on Feb 20 (Vincent v. Bondi case)
- No Sunday show bookings as of Feb 16
- No CPAC or campaign events identified
- Residual coverage expected from Feb 11 hearing and Feb 15 DOJ letter release

The agent report is thorough and fact-based, identifying concrete absence of scheduled events.

**Google Trends Data:**
Factual time-series data showing:
- Current value (Feb 17): 13
- Peak on Feb 12: 100 (day after hearing)
- Rapid decay: 100→60→33→23→18→13 over 5 days
- 90-day base rate: 84% of 11-day windows show ≤3 point change
- Recent 7-day average (42.0) heavily influenced by the Feb 11-13 spike

(b) Reference Class Analysis:

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **All 11-day windows in Bondi's Google Trends history (past 90 days)**: Most suitable. Directly measures typical volatility in search interest for this specific person over the exact timeframe we're predicting.

2. **Post-spike decay patterns for political figures**: Relevant but less precise. Political figures typically see rapid decay after news events, but individual patterns vary.

3. **Attorney General search interest patterns**: Too broad; different AGs have different profiles and news cycles.

**Chosen reference class:** The 90-day historical pattern for "pam bondi" with 11-day windows is most appropriate because:
- It captures her specific news cycle patterns
- Uses the exact timeframe (11 days: Feb 17-28)
- Accounts for typical volatility in her search interest
- Base rate shows 84% stability (≤3 point change)

(c) Timeframe Analysis:

**Prediction timeframe:** 11 days (Feb 17 to Feb 28, 2026)

**Starting point (Feb 17):** Value = 13
- This is already in decay phase from Feb 12 peak (100)
- 5-day decay pattern: 100→60→33→23→18→13
- Average daily decline: ~17.4 points/day initially, now ~5 points/day

**Historical patterns:**
- 90-day mean: 5.5 (suggesting 13 is still elevated)
- Typical baseline appears to be 2-4 range
- Major spike on Jan 25 (14) returned to baseline within days
- Feb 11-12 spike (47→100) is decaying rapidly

**Decay trajectory analysis:**
If current decay rate (~1 point/day) continues: 13→12→11→10→9→8→7→6→5→4→3→2 by Feb 28
This would represent a decrease of >3 points (resolution: "Decreases")

If decay slows/stabilizes: 13→12→11→10→10→10→10→10→10→10→10→10 by Feb 28
This would still be a decrease of 3 points (resolution: "Doesn't change")

If new event occurs: Could spike upward, but agent report found NO scheduled events

(d) Justification:

**Outside view factors favoring "Decreases":**
1. Clear decay pattern established: 100→13 over 5 days
2. Current value (13) is 2.4× above 90-day mean (5.5), suggesting reversion likely
3. No scheduled events to generate new interest (per agent report)
4. Historical pattern: Jan 25 spike (14) returned to baseline within days
5. News cycle has moved on; Feb 11 hearing is 6 days old by Feb 17
6. Only 6% of 11-day windows historically show >3 point decreases, but we're starting from an elevated position

**Factors favoring "Doesn't change":**
1. Strong base rate: 84% of 11-day windows show ≤3 point change
2. Possible floor effect: value may stabilize around 10-13 range
3. Residual coverage of Feb 11 hearing and Feb 15 DOJ letter could maintain interest

**Factors favoring "Increases":**
1. Extremely unlikely: only 10% base rate for increases
2. Would require unexpected event (unscheduled controversy, breaking news)
3. Agent report found no scheduled triggers

**Key tension:** The base rate strongly favors stability (84%), but we're starting from an elevated position (13 vs. mean of 5.5) in an active decay phase. The question is whether the value will:
- Decay to 10 (change of 3 = "Doesn't change")
- Decay to 9 or below (change of >3 = "Decreases")
- Spike upward (unlikely without trigger)

Outside view calibration:

**Calibration considerations:**

1. **Base rate anchoring:** The 84% "no change" rate is powerful but may be misleading here. It includes periods starting from baseline (2-4 range) where ±3 points is a large relative change. Starting from 13 (elevated), a 3-point drop to 10 is only 23% decline, which seems very plausible given the decay pattern.

2. **Decay physics:** The value has dropped 87 points in 5 days (100→13). Even if decay rate slows dramatically, losing 4+ more points over 11 days seems more likely than stabilizing within 3 points of 13.

3. **Mean reversion:** The 90-day mean of 5.5 suggests strong gravitational pull downward. To stay within 10-16 range for 11 days would require the decay to halt completely.

4. **Event-driven nature:** Bondi's search interest is highly event-driven (spikes to 47, 100 on hearing days, otherwise 2-4). Without new events, baseline is the attractor.

5. **Probability distribution calibration:**
- "Increases" (>16): Requires unexpected event. Agent found none scheduled. Historical rate 10%, but that includes periods with scheduled events. Given no triggers: 5-8%
- "Doesn't change" (10-16): Requires decay to halt or slow dramatically. Possible if media continues discussing Feb 11 hearing. But fighting strong mean reversion: 25-35%
- "Decreases" (<10): Natural continuation of established decay pattern toward baseline. Most consistent with physics of situation: 60-70%

6. **Uncertainty factors:**
- Unknown unknowns (breaking news) could spike interest
- Exact decay rate uncertain (could slow more than expected)
- Weekend vs. weekday patterns unclear
- Feb 20 Supreme Court conference is low-probability wildcard

7. **Calibration check:** Am I being overconfident in "Decreases"? 
- The decay pattern is very clear (5 consecutive days)
- Starting point is 2.4× above mean
- No scheduled events to reverse trend
- But base rate shows 84% stability historically
- This suggests 60-65% for "Decreases" is appropriate, not 80%+

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 7%
Doesn't change: 28%
Decreases: 65%
