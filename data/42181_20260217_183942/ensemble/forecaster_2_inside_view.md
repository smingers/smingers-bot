Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (High Quality):**
1. **House Judiciary Committee (Feb 5, 2026)** - Official announcement of Feb 11 hearing. Factual, no opinions.
2. **Vermont Public, WLRN, Roll Call (Feb 10-11, 2026)** - Multiple independent outlets covering the Feb 11 hearing with consistent facts: contentious exchanges, Epstein files focus, bipartisan criticism. Quotes from named sources (Raskin, Massie, Bondi). High credibility.
3. **KARE11 (date unclear but recent)** - Reports Bondi in Minneapolis announcing arrests. Factual reporting of events.
4. **Chicago Tribune (Feb 7, 2026)** - Reports Gabbard/FBI search controversy with Bondi defending actions. Multiple named sources.

**Secondary/Less Relevant Sources:**
5. **Raw Story (Feb 17, 2026)** - Opinion piece citing Massie's criticism of Bondi. Contains factual basis (Massie's statements) but editorial framing.
6. **ArcaMax (Feb 16, 2026)** - Opinion column criticizing Bondi's hearing performance. Heavy editorial content.
7. **Financial/Market News** - Multiple articles about bonds, stocks, gold, etc. Irrelevant to Pam Bondi except one mentioning "Pam Mineral" (unrelated company).
8. **Medium satirical piece (Feb 13, 2026)** - Parody article. No factual value.

**Key Expert/Entity Opinions:**
- Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-MD): Critical of DOJ Epstein handling
- Rep. Thomas Massie (R-KY): Bipartisan critic warning of more GOP "defections"
- Rep. Jim Jordan (R-OH): Supportive of Bondi
- Epstein survivors: Critical of redaction handling

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Feb 11 hearing generated major spike (value=100)**: Multiple independent sources confirm this was highly contentious, widely covered event. Current value (13 on Feb 17) represents 87% decline in 6 days, consistent with post-spike decay pattern.
- **No scheduled events Feb 17-28**: Agent report confirms no hearings, major appearances, or court filings scheduled. This removes primary catalyst for increased interest.
- **Historical decay pattern**: Outside view shows 67% of post-spike windows decrease >3 points, with median drop of -11 points.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Massie warning of "more defections"** (Feb 17): Suggests ongoing controversy but unclear if this generates search interest without concrete event.
- **Minneapolis arrests announcement**: Recent but timing unclear; if before Feb 17, already reflected in current value of 13.
- **Epstein files controversy ongoing**: Background noise but no new developments scheduled.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Opinion pieces criticizing Bondi**: Reflect existing controversy, unlikely to drive new searches without triggering event.
- **Gabbard/FBI controversy**: Week-old news, fading relevance.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window:** 11 days (Feb 17 → Feb 28)
**Current value:** 13 (as of Feb 17)
**Resolution:** Compare Feb 28 value to Feb 17 value

**If timeframe halved (5-6 days):** Would increase "Doesn't change" probability significantly (~60%) as insufficient time for major decay or new spike. Short windows favor status quo.

**If timeframe doubled (22 days):** Would increase "Decreases" probability (~55-60%) as more time allows decay to long-run mean (~3-5). Also increases chance of new catalyst event, slightly boosting "Increases" (~15-18%).

## (d) Justification

**Base rates from outside view:**
- Increases: 13%
- Doesn't change: 46%
- Decreases: 41%

**Key shifts from base rates:**

1. **Decay momentum is strong**: Value dropped from 100 (Feb 12) to 13 (Feb 17) = 87% decline in 5 days. Historical post-spike patterns show continued decay for 7-10 days. Current trajectory suggests Feb 18-20 values will be 8-11, making "decrease" (value <10 on Feb 28) increasingly likely.

2. **Catalyst vacuum**: No scheduled events means "Increases" requires unpredictable breaking news. While possible (Trump tweet, new Epstein revelation, legal action), the 11-day window and lack of scheduled triggers makes this less likely than base rate suggests. Shift down from 13% to ~8%.

3. **Mean reversion pressure**: Long-run mean for Bondi is ~3-5. Current value of 13 is elevated. Natural tendency is downward, but question is whether it crosses the -3 threshold. Values of 10-16 on Feb 28 would resolve "Doesn't change."

4. **Massie "defections" comment**: Could generate modest news cycle but unlikely to spike searches >3 points without concrete event (resignation, new hearing, etc.). Adds slight upside risk but insufficient to offset downward momentum.

**Probability shifts:**
- **Increases**: 13% → 8% (reduced due to catalyst vacuum, strong decay momentum)
- **Doesn't change**: 46% → 42% (slight reduction as decay likely to breach -3 threshold)
- **Decreases**: 41% → 50% (increased due to strong decay momentum, mean reversion, lack of offsetting catalysts)

## Probability Calibration

**Status quo continuation:** If current decay rate (≈1.5 points/day) continues, Feb 28 value would be ~-3 to +1, firmly in "Decreases" territory.

**Confidence check:** 
- 50% for "Decreases" = 1:1 odds. Does it feel equally likely that value stays ≥10 vs. drops <10? Given 5-day decay from 100→13 and no catalysts, <10 seems more likely. Comfortable with 50%.
- 8% for "Increases" = 12:1 against. Does unpredictable spike >3 points feel like 1-in-12 over 11 days? Seems reasonable given low base rate and no scheduled events.
- 42% for "Doesn't change" = value 10-16 on Feb 28. Requires decay to slow significantly or modest rebound. Plausible but less likely than continued decay.

**Blind spot:** Unexpected Trump administration action (firing, resignation, major policy announcement) could spike interest. However, this would need to be Bondi-specific, not just Trump-related.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Google Trends value for "pam bondi" on Feb 28 be >3 higher (Increases), within ±3 (Doesn't change), or >3 lower (Decreases) than Feb 17 value of 13?

2. **Base rate**: Outside view: 13% Increases, 46% Doesn't change, 41% Decreases. My final prediction maintains this ordering but shifts toward Decreases due to strong decay momentum.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = Decreases (50%); Least likely = Increases (8%). Makes sense given post-spike decay pattern and no scheduled catalysts.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Value dropped 87% in 5 days (100→13), strong decay momentum
   - No scheduled events Feb 17-28 per agent report
   - Historical post-spike windows: 67% decrease, median -11 points
   - Current value (13) elevated vs. long-run mean (3-5)
   - Massie "defections" comment unlikely to spike >3 points without concrete event

5. **Blind spot**: Major unexpected Trump administration action involving Bondi (resignation, firing, new scandal) could spike interest. Probability ~5-8%, already captured in "Increases" forecast.

6. **Status quo**: Current trajectory is downward decay. "Status quo continuation" favors Decreases, not Doesn't change. No adjustment needed.

7. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [8, 42, 50]
