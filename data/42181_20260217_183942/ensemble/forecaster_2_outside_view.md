Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Historical Context Sources (Feb 5-13, 2026):**

1. **House Judiciary Committee announcement (Feb 5, 2026)**: Official government source announcing Bondi's Feb 11 hearing. High reliability, factual.

2. **WAMC (Feb 11, 2026)**: Regional NPR affiliate covering the hearing. Factual reporting with direct quotes from participants. High reliability for events that occurred.

3. **C-SPAN clip**: Incomplete extraction, minimal useful information.

4. **NBC News (Feb 11, 2026)**: Major news outlet with detailed coverage of the hearing, including quotes from survivors, lawmakers, and reporting on Trump's dissatisfaction with Bondi. High reliability, mix of factual reporting and attributed opinions.

5. **AP News (Feb 11, 2026)**: Wire service coverage with comprehensive timeline of Epstein files controversy. Very high reliability for factual events.

6. **CNN Analysis (Feb 11, 2026)**: Opinion piece by Aaron Blake analyzing the hearing's political dynamics. Contains factual reporting but framed through analytical lens. Reliable for events, but analysis represents author's interpretation.

**Agent Report (Feb 17, 2026):**
Comprehensive search for scheduled events Feb 17-28. Key findings:
- No confirmed media appearances, speeches, or hearings
- Only a low-profile Supreme Court conference (Feb 20) in a habeas case
- No CPAC or major political events scheduled
- Notes that Sunday show rosters typically release Thursday/Friday

The agent report appears thorough and methodical, checking multiple sources (congressional calendars, PACER, political event calendars). High confidence in negative findings (absence of scheduled events).

**Google Trends Data:**
Objective data showing:
- Current value (Feb 17): 13
- Peak on Feb 12: 100 (day after hearing)
- Sharp decline from 100→60→33→23→18→13 over 5 days
- Base rate: 84% of 11-day windows show ≤3 point changes
- Recent 7-day average (42.0) heavily skewed by the Feb 11-12 spike

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **All 11-day windows in the 90-day dataset**: Base rate shows 84% "Doesn't change", 10% "Increases", 6% "Decreases"

2. **Post-spike decay patterns for political figures**: When a political figure has a major news event causing a Google Trends spike, interest typically decays rapidly in subsequent days unless new events occur.

3. **Pam Bondi's historical pattern**: The CNN article notes her Senate testimony in Oct 2025 "peaked at 100, fell below 20 within nine days" - showing rapid decay after media events.

4. **11-day windows starting from already-declining values**: When starting from a value already in decline (like the current 13 after a peak of 100), the question is whether the decay continues, stabilizes, or reverses.

**Most suitable reference class**: Post-spike decay patterns combined with the base rate analysis. The current value of 13 represents day 6 of a decay from the Feb 11-12 spike. Historical precedent (Oct 2025 pattern) suggests continued decline unless a new catalyst emerges.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 11 days (Feb 17 to Feb 28, 2026)

**Starting point**: Feb 17 value = 13
**Target date**: Feb 28 value
**Resolution criteria**: Change >3 points = Increases/Decreases; ≤3 points = Doesn't change

**Historical decay pattern from the current spike:**
- Feb 12: 100 (peak)
- Feb 13: 60 (-40)
- Feb 14: 33 (-27)
- Feb 15: 23 (-10)
- Feb 16: 18 (-5)
- Feb 17: 13 (-5)

The decay rate is slowing: from -40 to -27 to -10 to -5 to -5. This suggests approaching a baseline.

**90-day baseline context:**
- Mean: 5.5
- Most days show values of 2-4
- Occasional small spikes (Jan 25: 14)

**Pattern expectation**: The value of 13 is still elevated above the 90-day mean of 5.5. Without new catalysts, continued decay toward baseline (5-7 range) is expected over 11 days.

## (d) Justification

**Key factors supporting decline:**

1. **No scheduled catalysts**: Agent report confirms no media appearances, hearings, or events scheduled for Feb 17-28. The Supreme Court conference (Feb 20) is low-profile.

2. **Natural decay pattern**: The value has declined from 100 to 13 over 6 days, following the typical post-event decay pattern observed in Oct 2025.

3. **News cycle moved on**: The Feb 11 hearing and Feb 15 files release have been covered. Without fresh developments, media attention shifts elsewhere.

4. **Historical precedent**: 84% base rate for ≤3 point changes, but this includes all conditions. When starting from an elevated post-spike value, decay is more common.

**Factors that could cause stability or increase:**

1. **Approaching baseline**: At 13, we're only ~7 points above the 90-day mean. The decay may slow or stabilize.

2. **Residual coverage**: Continued pundit discussion or viral social media content about the hearing could maintain interest.

3. **Unexpected events**: Unscheduled DOJ announcements, leaks, or political developments could trigger renewed interest.

4. **Weekend/weekday patterns**: Google Trends can show day-of-week effects.

**Most likely scenario**: Continued gradual decline from 13 toward the 6-8 range by Feb 28, representing a decrease of 5-7 points. This would exceed the >3 threshold for "Decreases."

**Alternative scenario**: If the decay slows significantly and the value stabilizes around 10-11, the change would be ≤3 points, resulting in "Doesn't change."

**Unlikely scenario**: An increase would require an unforeseen catalyst, which the agent report suggests is improbable given the lack of scheduled events.

## Outside view calibration:

**Tethering to established distributions:**
- The 84% base rate for ≤3 point changes is calculated across all conditions, including stable baseline periods
- Our current situation is different: we're in an active decay phase from a major spike
- The Oct 2025 precedent showed Bondi's interest "fell below 20 within nine days" from a peak of 100
- Current trajectory: 100→13 in 6 days, suggesting continued decline

**Probability considerations:**
- The decay from 13 to below 10 (a >3 point decrease) seems more likely than stabilization
- However, as we approach baseline, the rate of decline typically slows
- A value around 8-10 by Feb 28 seems most probable (4-5 point decrease)
- A value of 10-16 would be "Doesn't change" (within 3 points)
- An increase above 16 would require an unexpected catalyst

**Rate of unexpected outcomes:**
In political news cycles, unexpected events do occur (leaks, controversies, policy announcements). However, the agent report's thorough search found no scheduled triggers, and the Feb 11 hearing aftermath appears to be winding down.

**Calibration:**
Given:
- Strong evidence of ongoing decay
- No scheduled catalysts
- Historical precedent for rapid post-spike decline
- But approaching a baseline where decay naturally slows

I assess:
- **Decreases** (>3 point drop): 55-60% - most likely given current trajectory
- **Doesn't change** (±3 points): 35-40% - possible if decay slows near baseline
- **Increases** (>3 point rise): 5-8% - requires unexpected catalyst

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 7%
Doesn't change: 36%
Decreases: 57%
