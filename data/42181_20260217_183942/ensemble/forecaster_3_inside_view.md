## (a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality/date; facts vs opinion)

1) **House Judiciary GOP page (Feb 5, 2026)**  
   - **What:** Announces DOJ oversight hearing with AG Pamela Bondi on Feb 11.  
   - **Quality:** High (primary/official).  
   - **Use:** Establishes a major attention catalyst (already occurred). Factual.

2) **Vermont Public (Feb 11, 2026)**  
   - **What:** Reports contentious hearing; Epstein files dispute; direct quotes; describes partisan clash.  
   - **Quality:** High (credible journalism, quotes).  
   - **Use:** Confirms peak-news catalyst and controversy theme. Mostly factual; some framing.

3) **WLRN (Feb 11, 2026)**  
   - **What:** Similar hearing coverage; broader claims about politicization; quotes from Jordan/Raskin/Massie.  
   - **Quality:** High-moderate (credible outlet; mix of factual and interpretive context).  
   - **Use:** Reinforces that story had multi-day legs. Factual core + analysis.

4) **Roll Call (Feb 10, 2026)**  
   - **What:** Previews hearing and expected Epstein-related criticism; details on document volumes/redactions.  
   - **Quality:** High (specialist congressional reporting).  
   - **Use:** Supports that the hearing was anticipated to be contentious (pre-peak driver). Mostly factual.

5) **KARE11 (date not shown in summary; appears mid-Feb 2026)**  
   - **What:** Bondi “on the ground” in Minneapolis announcing arrests connected to federal law enforcement/immigration operations.  
   - **Quality:** Moderate-high (local TV news; event reporting).  
   - **Use:** Potential **newer** or continuing catalyst that could sustain/renew searches beyond the Feb 11 hearing. Factual event claim, but I’m uncertain on exact date from provided snippet.

6) **Chicago Tribune / AP (Feb 7, 2026)**  
   - **What:** FBI search GA election office; conflicting accounts about Tulsi Gabbard’s presence; Bondi comments.  
   - **Quality:** High (AP).  
   - **Use:** Another news hook in early Feb; likely already “priced into” the earlier spike/decay.

7) **Raw Story (Feb 17, 2026)**  
   - **What:** Claims DOJ released a comprehensive list of names over the weekend; reports Massie criticism and “defections” talk.  
   - **Quality:** Low-moderate (partisan framing; may contain real quotes but needs caution).  
   - **Use:** Suggests continued churn in the Epstein-files story *right at the start of the forecast window*, which could slow the decay. Mix of fact claims + strong opinion language.

8) **ArcaMax / Clarence Page column (Feb 16, 2026)**  
   - **What:** Opinion column criticizing Bondi’s conduct; mentions DOJ staffing issues; frames as loyalty to Trump.  
   - **Quality:** Low for prediction-relevant “facts” (it’s commentary), moderate for indicating media attention persists.  
   - **Use:** Weak signal of ongoing coverage; mostly opinion.

(Other AskNews items about “bond” markets / “Pam Mineral” are irrelevant noise for this query term.)

## (b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution criteria)

**Strong evidence**
- **Post-spike decay is already in motion** (outside-view data: 100 peak around Feb 12, down to ~13 by Feb 17). This kind of decay is historically common for political-figure spikes unless a fresh catalyst hits.

**Moderate evidence**
- **Additional controversy may continue** into the window:  
  - KARE11 Minneapolis arrests story (if within/near Feb 17-28) is a plausible “second-wave” attention source.  
  - Raw Story indicates continued Epstein-files churn around Feb 17. Even if partisan, it points to *some* continuing storyline.
- **No clearly scheduled marquee event** (from your outside-view agent report): lowers odds of a large rebound.

**Weak evidence**
- Opinion columns/satire (ArcaMax, Medium) indicate cultural footprint but are not reliable predictors of search-volume direction.

Net: strong pull toward continued decline, but moderate counterweight that decay could **flatten** (making “Doesn’t change” more likely than in the outside view).

---

## (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Forecast horizon:** 11 days (Feb 17 → Feb 28).  
- If **halved** (~5–6 days): more likely we’re still on the decay slope, so **Decreases** would rise.  
- If **doubled** (~22 days): more time for either (i) reversion to low baseline (favoring Decreases) or (ii) an unpredictable new headline (raising Increases). Typically, longer windows raise tail risk (Increases) somewhat, but baseline reversion still dominates absent known scheduled events.

---

## (d) Justification (inside view adjustment from outside view)

**Outside view base rates (given):** Increases 7 / Doesn’t change 36 / Decreases 57.

**Status quo if nothing changes:** continued normalization from an event-driven spike; Feb 28 likely lower than Feb 17 by >3 points (so “Decreases”).

**Why I adjust toward “Doesn’t change” vs outside view:**  
- The outside view assumed limited new catalysts. However, the **Minneapolis arrest announcements** and **continuing Epstein-files coverage/criticism** suggest Bondi may keep appearing in the news ecosystem during the window. That can “prop up” search interest enough that the Feb 28 value ends up within ±3 of Feb 17 (especially if values are already near a floor where further drops are small in absolute terms).  
- Still, there’s **no clear scheduled tentpole** like a new hearing, indictment, resignation, etc., so the probability of a real rebound (>+3) remains relatively low.

Result: I keep **Decreases** as the modal outcome, but reduce it modestly; shift most of that mass into **Doesn’t change**, with a small bump to **Increases** for headline risk.

---

Probability calibration

- **Decreases**: Still most likely due to ongoing post-peak decay and lack of scheduled major events, but less than 57 because controversy signals could stabilize interest.  
- **Doesn’t change**: Increased because late-stage decay often flattens and because there are plausible continuing news hooks.  
- **Increases**: Slightly higher than base rate due to headline risk, but still low without a major new catalyst.

Checklist:
1) Criteria/options check: compares Feb 17 vs Feb 28 on fixed-window URL; >3 up=increase, within 3=no change, >3 down=decrease.  
2) Outside view base rates used: [7, 36, 57].  
3) Consistency check: Most likely=Decreases; Least likely=Increases; consistent with decay + limited tentpoles.  
4) Key evidence (most significant):
   - Post-hearing spike already decaying sharply (100→~13 by Feb 17).  
   - No clearly scheduled marquee Bondi event Feb 17–28 (agent report).  
   - Ongoing Epstein-files churn/coverage around Feb 16–17 (Raw Story + broader coverage).  
   - Minneapolis arrests announcement could sustain baseline attention (KARE11; date uncertainty).  
5) Blind spot: a surprise major DOJ action/scandal/resignation/indictment could trigger a new spike, making “Increases” win.  
6) Status quo: gradual decline toward baseline; nudges toward Decreases but tempered by likely flattening.  
7) Technicalities: probabilities 0–100, sum to 100.

Probabilities: [9, 41, 50]
