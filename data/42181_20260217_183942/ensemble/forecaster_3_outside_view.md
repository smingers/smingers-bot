Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis
1) **House Judiciary Committee Republicans hearing notice (Feb 5, 2026)**  
   - **What it says (facts):** Pam Bondi (AG) was the witness for a Feb 11 “Oversight of the U.S. Department of Justice” hearing.  
   - **Quality/date:** Primary source for scheduling; reliable for the fact of the hearing. It’s now **historical** relative to the Feb 17–28 window.

2) **WAMC article (Feb 11, 2026)**  
   - **Facts:** Describes a combative hearing; notes Epstein-files focus, bipartisan criticism moments, and broader controversies.  
   - **Opinions:** Quotes lawmakers’ views; these are partisan/advocacy-laden but useful for gauging controversy.  
   - **Quality/date:** Regional outlet; generally fine for recap. Dated **before** the resolution window, but can explain a post-event decay pattern.

3) **C-SPAN clip page (date unclear; content incomplete/corrupted in extraction)**  
   - **Facts:** At most, indicates an event page exists; extraction lacks substantive testimony details.  
   - **Quality/date:** C-SPAN is strong when content is accessible; here it’s **not informative** due to missing text/date.

4) **NBC News (Feb 11, 2026)**  
   - **Facts:** High-profile recap; mentions survivors press conference, shouting matches, White House dissatisfaction claims, and the grand jury rejection story.  
   - **Opinions:** Includes framing/analysis; but factual reporting is typically solid.  
   - **Quality/date:** Strong mainstream source; again **pre-window** but explains why searches spiked.

5) **AP News (Feb 11, 2026)**  
   - **Facts:** Detailed recap and timeline; emphasizes redaction failures and political confrontation.  
   - **Opinions:** Quotes politicians; AP itself tends to be measured.  
   - **Quality/date:** Very strong wire; pre-window but important for understanding the *type* of event that creates spikes.

6) **CNN analysis (Feb 11, 2026)**  
   - **Facts:** Summarizes key exchanges and mentions a poll result; some factual, some interpretive.  
   - **Opinions:** Explicit analysis framing (e.g., “playing to Trump”).  
   - **Quality/date:** Medium-high; useful for salience/virality context, but more interpretive.

7) **Agent report (compiled through Feb 16, 2026)**  
   - **Facts/claims:** No scheduled high-profile Bondi events in Feb 17–28; one date-certain but low-profile SCOTUS conference item; notes that post-hearing “echo” coverage likely wanes.  
   - **Quality/date:** A synthesis that may miss late-breaking bookings; still, the *absence* of scheduled events by Feb 16 is meaningful because major appearances are often promoted in advance.

8) **Google Trends data block (last 90 days + daily values)**  
   - **Facts:** Provides empirical base rates for 11-day windows (≤3 change 84%; increase>3 10%; decrease>3 6%) and shows a sharp spike on Feb 11–12 followed by rapid decay to 13 on Feb 17.  
   - **Quality/date:** Directly relevant quantitative evidence; the best single input for an outside-view baseline.

### (b) Reference class analysis
Plausible reference classes:

1) **All 11-day changes for “pam bondi” in the last ~90 days (US, Google Trends)**  
   - **Pros:** Matches the question’s scoring rule (change threshold >3 over ~11 days). Empirical and directly on-target.  
   - **Cons:** Only ~90 days; may underrepresent rare “big news” shocks.

2) **11-day windows immediately following a major political-media spike for a public official**  
   - **Pros:** More behaviorally similar to the current situation (post-hearing, post-spike decay).  
   - **Cons:** Harder to quantify cleanly from the provided data; could be cherry-picked.

**Most suitable for outside view:** (1) the provided 90-day empirical distribution, with a modest adjustment informed by (2) because the current context appears to be a post-spike comedown.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Forecasting window:** from **2026-02-17 to 2026-02-28**, i.e., **11 days forward** from today (Feb 17).
- **Historical pattern over similar periods (from the data):**
  - In **84%** of 11-day windows, the term stays within ±3 (“Doesn’t change”).
  - **10%** increase >3; **6%** decrease >3.
- **Current time-series shape:** a classic sharp spike (Feb 12 = 100) followed by rapid decline (60 → 33 → 23 → 18 → 13 by Feb 17). In many attention cycles, the post-peak period is dominated by further decay absent a new trigger.

---

### (d) Justification (outside view)
- Start with the *outside-view base rate*: **“Doesn’t change” is most common (84%)** for 11-day changes, making it the default.
- However, the **current level (13 on Feb 17)** sits on the downward slope after a major spike. In post-spike regimes, the next 11 days are **more likely to see continued drift downward** than an increase, especially given the agent report’s finding of **no scheduled high-salience events** in-window.
- For the question to resolve **“Decreases,”** Feb 28 must be **≤ 9** (since “within 3” of 13 is 10–16). Given the recent rapid decay, falling below 10 by late February seems materially plausible.
- For **“Increases,”** Feb 28 would need to be **≥ 17**, which likely requires either (i) a fresh controversy/announcement, (ii) a new media booking, or (iii) a legal/political shock. Those are possible but (outside view) not the modal outcome.

Net: compared with the unconditional 90-day base rates, the *post-spike decay context* nudges probability mass from “Doesn’t change” toward “Decreases,” while keeping “Increases” relatively low.

Outside view calibration:

- **Anchor to observed distribution:** [Increase 10%, No-change 84%, Decrease 6%].
- **Context adjustment (post-spike mean reversion + no scheduled events):**
  - Increase: slightly down vs 10% (fewer planned catalysts) but not near-zero due to genuine risk of an unanticipated news event.
  - Decrease: meaningfully up vs 6% because we’re already in a steep decay phase and only need to cross below 10 to trigger “Decreases.”
  - No-change: remains largest but reduced from 84% due to the directional momentum.

I’ll calibrate to: **Increase 9%, Doesn’t change 63%, Decrease 28%**. This preserves “no-change” as the plurality while reflecting elevated downside drift risk and nontrivial upset risk from random news.

Outside View Prediction:
- Increases: 9  
- Doesn't change: 63  
- Decreases: 28
