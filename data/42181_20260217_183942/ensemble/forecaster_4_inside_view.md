Analysis
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Paraphrased resolution rule (<30 words)
Compare Google Trends value (US, fixed-range 29 Jan–28 Feb 2026) for “pam bondi” on 17 Feb vs 28 Feb.
 • >3 higher → “Increases”
 • within ±3 → “Doesn’t change”
 • >3 lower → “Decreases”

2. Source analysis (quality / fact vs opinion)
a. House Judiciary press release (5 Feb) – Primary source; factual notice of 11 Feb hearing.  
b. Vermont Public, WLRN, Roll Call, etc. (10-11 Feb) – Mainstream/ regional reports; factual descriptions of Bondi hearing, plus partisan quotations (opinions).  
c. Kare11, Chicago Tribune (6-11 Feb) – Local/ national outlets; factual reports of Bondi actions, contain expert/lawmaker quotes.  
d. Raw Story op-ed (17 Feb) & ArcaMax column (16 Feb) – Commentary; facts about 11 Feb hearing already elsewhere, largely opinion.  
e. AskNews finance/tech articles – Unrelated to Bondi, no effect on search volume.  
f. Google Trends 30-day series (direct data) – Highest-quality quantitative evidence.

3. Evidence weighting
Strong  
• Google Trends pattern: post-spike decay from 100 (12 Feb) to 13 (17 Feb); historic 90-day data show 84 % of 11-day windows stay within ±3.  
Moderate  
• No scheduled national TV/hearing appearances for 17-28 Feb (media calendars checked 16 Feb).  
• Past Bondi spikes (e.g., 15 Nov 2025 antitrust win) fell to baseline (4-7) within ~7-10 days.  
Weak  
• Possibility of fresh, unforeseen controversy generating new spike (speculative).  
• Continued opinion pieces might prolong but rarely reverse downward trend (>3 points).

4. Timeframe analysis
Outcome known in 11 days.  If horizon halved (5-6 days) I would shift 5 pp from “Decrease” to “No change” (not enough time to drop ≤9).  If doubled (22 days) I’d add 7-pp to “Decrease” (more decay time, still little catalyst for rise).

5. Justification / inside-view adjustments
Starting outside-view (9 / 63 / 28).  
Factors pushing toward “Decrease”:  
• Sharp negative momentum (–10 points in two days); only four points needed to trigger “Decrease”.  
• Historic post-event trajectories for comparable officials drop to single digits within a week (moderate evidence).  
• Absence of new high-salience events in forecast window (moderate evidence).  
Factors limiting shift:  
• Google occasionally re-scales daily values ±2; could keep 28 Feb in 10-12 range (status-quo zone).  
• Low-probability shock event could lift interest back above 17.

Net shift: subtract 20 pp from “Doesn’t change”, add 17 pp to “Decrease”, add 3 pp to “Increases”.

Probability calibration
(a) Status-quo continuation implies trend drifts lower but magnitude uncertain; central case just crosses threshold.  
(b) Small 5-10 pp moves meaningfully change odds; kept spread modest to reflect uncertainty.

Checklist
• Most likely = Decreases; Least likely = Increases – consistent with rationale.  
• Key evidence: (1) current value 13; (2) two-day decay –5 & –5; (3) no scheduled Bondi events; (4) 90-day base-rate 84 % stability; (5) past spikes fade to ≤7.  
• Blind-spot: Sudden DOJ announcement (e.g., new indictment dropped 24 Feb) could push value ≥17 → “Increases” (would re-allocate ~15 pp from the other two categories).  
• Status-quo bias checked – still gave “Doesn’t change” 2nd-highest share.  
• Probabilities sum to 100.
