Analysis:
a) Source analysis  
1. House Judiciary press release (5 Feb 2026, congressional website).  Factual schedule notice announcing Pam Bondi’s 11 Feb hearing.  High-quality primary source, minimal opinion.  
2. WAMC article (11 Feb 2026, regional NPR affiliate).  Straight news about the hearing; facts (length, topics, quotations) are credible, commentary minimal.  
3. C-SPAN clip page (undated).  Only meta-data, no substantive content; provides no usable facts.  
4. NBC News article (11 Feb 2026, national outlet).  Detailed factual recap of the hearing plus a few unattributed White House opinions.  Reporting standards high; opinions clearly flagged.  
5. AP News article (11 Feb 2026, wire service).  Similar factual detail, neutral tone; high reliability.  
6. CNN analysis piece (11 Feb 2026).  Mix of fact and analyst opinion.  Factual items (quotes, poll numbers) are credible; interpretive “takeaways” treated as opinion.  
7. Agent report (generated 16 Feb 2026).  Collates docket calendars, committee schedules, media-booking sheets.  All items are verifiable; no hidden advocacy.  Provides a negative finding: no scheduled Bondi events for 17-28 Feb.  
8. GoogleTrendsData dump (covering 90 & 30 days, pulled 17 Feb 2026).  Quantitative primary data.

b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates:  
• Any 11-day window for the search term “pam bondi” over the past 90 days.  
• 11-day windows that begin 6-9 days after a single-day value ≥50 (post-spike mean-reversion cases).  
• 11-day windows for comparable U.S. Cabinet officials following a contentious Hill appearance (e.g., “Merrick Garland” Sept 2023, “Alejandro Mayorkas” Feb 2024).

The second class is most germane: we are now five days past a 100-level spike produced by a one-day media event.  For Bondi herself we have two earlier analogues (Oct 2025 Senate testimony and Feb 2025 “Epstein binder” photo-op).  In both instances search interest fell by >60 % within a week and was ≤10 by day +10.  Thus, the post-spike mean-reversion class best captures current conditions.

c) Time-frame analysis  
Forecast window: 11 days (17 Feb → 28 Feb).  Historical pattern for the term:  
• Unconditional (last 90 days, N≈79 overlapping windows):  
 “Doesn’t change” (Δ≤3) 84 %  
 Increase (>+3)    10 %  
 Decrease (<-3)     6 %  
• Conditioned on starting value ≥10 and a preceding spike (N=8):  
 Decrease 62 %  
 No change 25 %  
 Increase 13 %  
The current value (13) sits 4–5× the low-noise baseline (≈3).  Absent another trigger, values normally drift downward 3–8 pts over the next 10 days.

d) Justification  
1. Status-quo drivers: the only major attention-getting event (11 Feb hearing) is already in the rear-view mirror.  Agent report finds no scheduled TV hits, rallies, or court showdowns between now and 28 Feb.  
2. Media echo decay: prior Bondi spikes show a half-life of ~3 days; we are on day +6.  Google data already shows a fall from 100 → 13.  Remaining commentary typically produces either stability (±2) or continued easing.  
3. Upside risk: a surprise DOJ press release or leaked document could reignite coverage, but the historical upset rate for an unforeseen “second spike” inside 11 days is low (~10–15 %).  
4. Downside risk: even a mild fade from 13 to ≤9 triggers the “Decreases” category (needs >3-pt drop).  That is well within the one-sigma band of past post-spike slides.

Taken together, an outside-view (base-rate) read gives the edge to “Decreases,” but with substantial probability mass on “Doesn’t change” and a modest tail on “Increases.”

Outside view calibration:
• Base-rate starting point: 10 % Increase / 84 % No change / 6 % Decrease.  
• Conditioned post-spike adjustment shifts 10 pts from No change toward Decrease and 3 pts from Increase toward Decrease.  
• Upset allowance: maintain ~8 % on Increase to account for black-swans (e.g., sudden indictment).  
Resulting calibrated probabilities (rounded to whole %): ≈ 8 / 47 / 45.

Outside View Prediction:
['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']  
Increases: 8%  
Doesn't change: 47%  
Decreases: 45%
