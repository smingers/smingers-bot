Analysis:
To judge whether Google search interest in “pam bondi” is likely to shift in the next 11 days I need to know if anything that typically spikes public attention—court filings, TV appearances, campaign activity, endorsements, scandals, or scheduled speeches—has just broken or is planned before 28 Feb 2026. Recent coverage or official calendars mentioning her name will be the best clue. Therefore I should look for 1) any fresh or upcoming news articles, 2) listings of televised interviews, conferences, or political events where she is slated to appear, and 3) rumors or announcements (e.g., runs for office, involvement in Trump-related legal actions) circulating in political media.
