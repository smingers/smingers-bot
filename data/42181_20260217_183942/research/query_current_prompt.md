The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “pam bondi” change between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-28 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “pam bondi” at the time of writing this question (Feb 16, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 19; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=pam%20bondi&date=2026-01-17%202026-02-16).
