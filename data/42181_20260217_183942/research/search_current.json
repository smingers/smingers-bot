Jim Himes (D-CT)**, senior Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee: Stated \"The intelligence community operates outside the borders of the US for good reason, and the Director of National Intelligence has no business at a law enforcement operation unless there is a legitimate foreign nexus, of which we've seen no indication.\"\n\n- **Democratic lawmakers' concerns** (not attributed to specific named sources beyond Himes and Warner):\n  - Blurring of lines between intelligence work (typically focused on foreign threats) and domestic law enforcement operations\n  - Potential groundwork for federal government to assert 2020 race was tainted by foreign meddling or to cast doubt on future elections\n  - If criminal charges are brought, Gabbard's presence could enable defense arguments that the investigation was politically motivated\n\n- **Sen. Mark Warner (D-VA)** and Rep.

During a House Judiciary Committee hearing on February 11, 2026, Bondi dismissed concerns by shifting focus to stock market gains, a move Massie described as 'weak and frustrated' and irrelevant to her duties. He criticized her for relying on a 'stack of pre-prepared insults'\u2014referred to as 'oppo research'\u2014during questioning, indicating a lack of substantive response. The Department of Justice\u2019s release of a comprehensive list of names from the Epstein documents over the weekend failed to clarify the investigation and instead intensified backlash. Massie stated that the public consensus is that Bondi 'didn't do a great job' and warned that more GOP defections are likely, noting, 'I think you're going to see more defections.' He also declined to pursue immediate court action, asserting that the GOP is already winning the momentum, as Bondi's defensive tactics and the DOJ\u2019s reactive unredactions have weakened her position.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 03:30 PM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/bondi-epstein-files-2675275837/)\n\n**Government bond prices slip ahead of \u20b9379 billion state debt auction - CNBC TV18**\nIndia's bond market showed mixed trends on February 17, 2026, with most government bonds trading lower as traders took short positions ahead of a \u20b9379 billion state debt auction.

The bond has a 6-year maturity with quarterly coupon payments and a 'step-up' structure of 2+2+2 years, meaning interest rates increase every two years. Investors who purchase during the offering period and hold until maturity will receive an additional 0.8% final bonus on the nominal capital invested. The minimum guaranteed interest rates for each two-year period and the ISIN code will be revealed on Friday, February 27, 2026. Experts, including Gabriel Debach from eToro and Alberto Biolzi from Cassa Lombarda, highlight the bond\u2019s appeal due to its steady income stream, tax benefits (12.5% on coupons and bonus, inheritance tax exemption, and ISEE exclusion up to \u20ac50,000), and the 0.8% loyalty bonus. However, risks include potential capital losses if market yields rise or the BTP-Bund spread widens to 100\u2013120 basis points, and a real return near zero or negative if inflation exceeds 3%. The bond\u2019s attractiveness is also challenged by strong competition from European investment-grade corporate debt, which offers better yield, spread, and diversification, according to John Taylor of AllianceBernstein. The issuance comes in a market context of compressed yields and selective investors, with prior issues raising over \u20ac96 billion and a growing concentration of large-ticket investments. The bond is available only to retail investors via online banking, bank branches, or post offices, through the MOT platform, with Intesa Sanpaolo, UniCredit, Banco BPM, Banca Monte dei Paschi di Siena, and ICCREA Banca as dealers. The minimum investment is \u20ac1,000, and there are no fees for small investors.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 08:38 AM\nSource:[FinanzaOnline](https://www.finanzaonline.com/notizie/btp-valore-verso-la-nuova-edizione-pro-e-contro-il-parere-degli-esperti)\n\n**FIIs remain net sellers in Indian stock market in February so far. Will the trend change? | Stock Market News**\nIn February 2026, India's Nifty 50 index rose 0.6%, driven by the Union Budget 2026 and a US-India trade deal, despite Foreign Institutional Investors (FIIs) recording a net sell-off of \u20b91,374 crores in the cash market as of February 13. FIIs were net buyers on seven of the first eleven trading days, but a sharp \u20b97,395 crore sell-off on February 13\u2014amid a 336-point drop in the Nifty 50 and an 8.2% plunge in the IT index due to the 'Anthropic shock'\u2014skewed the overall figure. This follows a larger net sell-off of \u20b941,435.22 crores in January. Dr. VK Vijayakumar of Geojit Investment Ltd attributes the sell-off to heavy FII exits from IT stocks, but expects a reversal once the AI-related market volatility subsides, especially if the US AI trade unwind extends, making India\u2014seen as a non-AI market\u2014a more attractive destination. Domestic Institutional Investors (DIIs) have provided stability by purchasing \u20b99,775.95 crore in February, following a \u20b969,220.74 crore buy-in in January. Analysts like Mohit and Tiwari suggest the current FII caution reflects a necessary 'cool-off phase' that filters out speculative capital, paving the way for patient, long-term investors. The structural fundamentals of India remain intact, with fair valuations and improving corporate earnings prospects for FY27. The STT hike is also credited with reducing speculative activity in the F&O segment, contributing to lower volumes. Experts believe FIIs are likely to resume buying once the IT sector stabilizes and global AI-related turbulence eases.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 11:13 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/market/stock-market-news/fiis-remain-net-sellers-in-indian-stock-market-in-february-so-far-will-the-trend-change-11771238490361.html)\n\n**On Monday 16th of February Pam Mineral trades -3.8 percent lower**\nPam Mineral (NICL.JK) traded -3.8% lower over a 24-hour period ending at 09:41 AM Central Europe Time on Monday, February 16, 2026.

Bondi defended the Trump administration amid allegations of misconduct by Department of Homeland Security agents in Minneapolis and Chicago, and criticized the handling of the Jeffrey Epstein files, including the failure to redact victims' identities and nude images. She dismissed concerns from victims present in the hearing, stating she would not 'get in the gutter for her theatrics.' Bondi also shifted focus to positive economic indicators\u2014such as the Dow surpassing 50,000 and the NASDAQ setting records\u2014despite the irrelevance of stock market performance to the committee\u2019s inquiry. The article highlights a broader staffing crisis within the Department of Justice, with federal attorneys expressing disillusionment, one stating, 'This job sucks,' and another admitting, 'I don't have the power or the voice to fix it.' The piece argues that Bondi's actions reflect loyalty to 'an audience of one'\u2014President Trump\u2014prioritizing political vendettas over justice, including pursuing revenge on political opponents like James Comey and Letitia James, reviving debunked conspiracy theories, and delaying Epstein file disclosures. The author expresses skepticism about Bondi\u2019s fitness for office, noting her performance undermines public confidence in the DOJ.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:33 AM\nSource:[ArcaMax](https://www.arcamax.com/politics/fromtheleft/clarencepage/s-4010626)\n\n**Alphabet's Bond Issuance Sparks Concerns Over Absence of Investor Protection Clauses**\nAlphabet, the parent company of Google, raised $31.5 billion through a global bond issuance on April 9\u201310, 2024, in U.S. dollars, British pounds, and Swiss francs, reflecting strong investor demand for its AI-driven cloud business. The issuance attracted over $100 billion in demand for its $20 billion dollar-denominated bonds, highlighting high market interest. However, concerns have emerged over the absence of key investor protection clauses in these bonds, particularly the lack of change-of-control covenants and other standard restrictions typically found in debt contracts. According to Anthony Canales, Global Research Head at Covenant Review based in New York, Alphabet\u2019s bonds lack these protections, a pattern also observed in major cloud providers such as Amazon, Meta, Microsoft, and Oracle. BofA Securities reported that these five leading AI cloud companies issued $121 billion in bonds in 2025, with Oracle\u2019s $25 billion bond issuance in February 2026 and Meta\u2019s $30 billion issuance in October 2025 also lacking essential safeguards. Julia Kandshko, CEO of Mind Money, a broker based in Cyprus, warned that weak financial covenants could trigger secondary market instability, as future buyers would rely more on interest rates, market sentiment, and liquidity rather than robust contractual protections. BofA\u2019s analyst Tom Kalcro projected that new bond issuances by these five companies could exceed $30 billion in 2026 due to rising AI-related spending needs.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:21 AM\nSource:[\u30cb\u30e5\u30fc\u30ba\u30a6\u30a3\u30fc\u30af\u65e5\u672c\u7248 \u30aa\u30d5\u30a3\u30b7\u30e3\u30eb\u30b5\u30a4\u30c8](https://www.newsweekjapan.jp/headlines/business/2026/02/587702.php)\n\n**What Investors Should Watch This Week**\nInvestors should monitor several key events and indicators this week.

The manager initially presents the evaluation, prompting Eric to react with outrage, questioning its fairness and comparing it to the volatility of the stock market. When pressed about his refusal to approve a leave request from February 19, 2025, Eric deflects by accusing the manager of theatricality. He denies having an anger problem, claiming his outbursts are premeditated and rehearsed, stating, 'I actually rehearsed a lot of this in front of the mirror this morning.'

Bondi, who previously worked as a partner at Ballard Partners\u2014a lobbying firm that represented UnitedHealth Group\u2019s parent company\u2014has been accused of violating ethical commitments by pursuing the capital charge after pledging to recuse herself from Ballard-related matters for one year upon taking office in February. Mangione\u2019s lawyers claim Bondi\u2019s continued financial ties to Ballard, including a profit-sharing agreement and a defined contribution plan, further tainted her impartiality. They assert that her public statements supporting the death penalty, made before Mangione was formally indicted, breached her ethical oath and violated due process rights. The legal team is seeking to bar prosecutors from pursuing the death penalty and to have certain charges dismissed. A hearing is scheduled for January 9, 2026. Thompson, 50, was fatally shot on December 4, 2024, as he approached a Manhattan hotel for UnitedHealth Group\u2019s annual investor conference. Surveillance footage captured a masked gunman shooting him from behind, and police reported that the ammunition bore the words 'delay,' 'deny,' and 'depose,' referencing insurers\u2019 practices in denying claims.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: December 20, 2025 01:45 PM\nSource:[Florida Politics](https://floridapolitics.com/archives/770592-mangione-bondi/)\n\n**Gold Wavers on Dimmer Fed Cut Outlook, Jitters Over Tech Stocks**\nGold prices fluctuated amid declining investor expectations for a U.S. interest-rate cut in December and growing nervousness over tech earnings, particularly ahead of Nvidia Corp.'s report. Global equity markets fell as concerns over high valuations intensified a risk-off sentiment. Analysts at Saxo Bank AS noted that both gold and silver were pressured by equity-driven risk aversion, with rising volatility prompting traders to unwind leveraged positions. Interest-rate swaps now indicate less than a 50% chance of a December rate cut, down from near-certain pricing just a month prior. The upcoming September jobs report from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics on Thursday is expected to provide key insight into the health of the labor market. Despite the recent pullback, gold has gained over 50% this year and is on track for its best annual performance since 1979, supported by strong demand as a hedge against fiscal instability and elevated central-bank buying. Goldman Sachs reported that central banks purchased an estimated 64 tons of gold in September\u2014more than triple the August figure\u2014with China adding an estimated 15 tons, surpassing the 1.24 tons officially reported. Meanwhile, legal tensions between Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook and the Trump administration continued, with Cook rebutting allegations of mortgage fraud in a letter to Attorney General Pam Bondi; the U.S. Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on her case on January 21, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 04:59 PM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The company emphasized that its proposal protects European publishers and advertisers, stating, 'Our proposal fully addresses the EC's decision without a disruptive break-up that would harm the thousands of European publishers and advertisers.' The European Commission had fined Google \u20ac2.95 billion in September 2024 for breaching antitrust rules related to self-preferencing practices and conflicts of interest in the adtech supply chain, requiring Google to submit a remedy plan within 60 days. While the EU has received the proposal, it remains uncertain whether it will be deemed sufficient. The Justice Department in the U.S. had previously brought an antitrust case against Google in 2023, alleging monopolization of the digital advertising market; the department won the case in 2025, with Attorney General Pam Bondi calling it a 'landmark victory.' However, Google disputes this, arguing that publishers choose its tools because they are 'simple, affordable and effective.' Publishers, including the European Publishers Council, maintain that behavioral changes have failed to rebalance the market and that structural reforms are necessary, stating, 'Without structural change, Google will continue to own and control the tools and data flows that determine the terms of trade for the entire digital advertising ecosystem.' The company now faces the conclusion of its remedies trial next week, with the Justice Department demanding structural changes.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 15, 2025 03:50 AM\nSource:[Washington Examiner](https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/business/3888242/google-refuses-bow-eu-regulators-antitrust-probe/)\n\n**Avoid buying digital gold**\nThe Securities and Exchange Board of India (Sebi) has warned investors against purchasing digital gold offered by online platforms, as these products are not regulated by Sebi or the Reserve Bank of India (RBI), leaving investors exposed to significant risks. Digital gold, sold by companies like Augmont Gold, MMTC-PAMP India, and Digital Gold India (SafeGold), as well as fintech platforms such as Paytm, Google Pay, PhonePe, and InCred Money, is not backed by physical gold in a verifiable manner. Investors are advised to demand a third-party vault certificate confirming physical gold holdings; if unavailable, they should avoid such investments. Sebi previously flagged digital gold sales in 2021 as a breach of Rule 8(3)(f) of the Securities Contracts (Regulation) Rules, 1957, and instructed stockbrokers not to offer them. The volume of digital gold purchases via UPI more than doubled from January to September 2025, rising from 51 million to 103 million transactions, with value increasing from \u20b9762 crore to \u20b91,410 crore. Risks include counterparty risk, lack of gold backing, absence of independent audits, unclear fees and taxation, and pricing discrepancies across platforms. Experts, including Kaynat Chainwala of Kotak Securities and Saurabh Jain of Stable Money, recommend safer, Sebi-regulated alternatives such as gold ETFs, electronic gold receipts, and exchange-traded commodity derivatives. Gold ETFs have seen record inflows\u2014\u20b98,363 crore in September 2025 and \u20b97,743 crore in October\u2014pushing assets under management past the \u20b91 lakh crore mark by October-end.

Bondi stated that the page was part of an organized effort to identify and harass federal agents, contributing to a 'wave of violence' against ICE personnel driven by online apps and social media campaigns. Meta confirmed the page was taken down for violating its policies on coordinated harm, though it did not immediately respond to requests for comment. This action followed similar moves by Apple Inc. and Alphabet Inc. (Google), which removed apps enabling users to track ICE agents' movements. Tech leaders such as Alexis Ohanian and Paul Graham criticized the Trump administration\u2019s tactics, warning of moral decline and citing personal immigrant experiences.
