Jamie Raskin (D-Md.) criticized redactions in Epstein documents, claiming they protect powerful individuals rather than survivors\n\n3. **Bondi's Defense:**\n   - Defended DOJ's handling of files, citing release of \"millions of documents\"\n   - Expressed sympathy for victims, calling Epstein a \"monster\"\n   - Pushed back against Democratic criticism, sometimes with personal attacks (called Rep. Pramila Jayapal's questions \"theatrics,\" called Rep. Thomas Massie a \"failed politician\" with \"Trump derangement syndrome\")\n\n4. **Bipartisan Criticism:** Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.) was noted as one of few Republicans to press Bondi on Epstein, demanding accountability for sharing survivor information and accusing officials of \"over-redacting\" incriminating information.\n\n5. **Broader DOJ Actions Under Bondi:**\n   - Firing of career prosecutors and FBI officials who worked on Capitol riot cases or Trump investigations\n   - Investigation and prosecution of Trump opponents\n   - Dropped prosecutions of Trump allies\n   - Brought charges against former FBI Director James Comey and New York AG Letitia James (both cases dismissed by federal judge; DOJ is appealing)\n   - Investigations of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell, Sen. Adam Schiff, and former Obama-era intelligence officials James Clapper and John Brennan\n\n6. **Recent Legal Setback:** A grand jury in Washington, D.C. rejected federal prosecutors' attempt to indict Democratic lawmakers on federal charges related to a video directing military members to refuse illegal orders.\n\n## Opinions from Named Sources:\n\n- **Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Md.):** \"You're not showing a lot of interest in the victims... You're siding with the perpetrators, and you're ignoring the victims. That will be your legacy unless you act quickly to change course.\" Also stated: \"You've turned the people's Department of Justice into Trump's instrument of revenge. Trump orders up prosecutions like pizza, and you deliver every time.\"\n\n- **Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio), Committee Chairman:** \"What a difference a year makes. The DOJ has returned to its core missions \u2014 upholding the rule of law, going after the bad guys and keeping Americans safe.\"\n\n- **Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Ky.):** \"This cover-up spans decades, and you are responsible for this portion of it.\"\n\n## Context from Article (Less Attributed):\n\n- The article notes that Biden-era DOJ officials deny politicizing the department, pointing to prosecutions of Democratic lawmakers and Hunter Biden as evidence\n- Critics say DOJ independence has disappeared under Bondi and the department has enacted Trump's \"promised campaign of retribution\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.c-span.org/clip/house-committee/attorney-general-delivers-opening-statement-to-house-judiciary-committee/5192722\">\n# Summary of Article\n\n**Disclaimer**: The extracted content appears to be incomplete or corrupted, consisting primarily of repetitive boilerplate text about C-SPAN's book purchasing program and viewing features.

Give us the rest of the files and start the investigations\"\n   - Sky Roberts (brother of Virginia Giuffre) called Bondi's handling \"nothing short of a failure\"\n   - The Justice Department failed to properly redact survivors' names when files were made public\n   - Bondi blamed the redaction failures on lawyers rushing to meet the December 19 deadline set by the Epstein Files Transparency Act\n   - Only a small fraction of files were released on the deadline; the majority were released in February 2026\n   - When asked about future charges, Bondi said there were \"pending investigations\" without clarifying details\n\n2. **Political Tensions:**\n   - Bondi called Trump \"the greatest president in American history\"\n   - She accused Democrats of \"theatrics\" and made personal attacks on lawmakers, calling Rep. Jamie Raskin a \"washed-up lawyer\"\n   - She also attacked Rep.

Raskin accused Bondi of turning the DOJ into \"Trump's instrument of revenge\"\n\n3. **Prosecutions and Grand Jury:**\n   - NBC News reported (same day as hearing) that a federal grand jury rejected the Trump administration's attempts to indict Democratic lawmakers over a social media video\n   - Bondi told Rep. Jim Jordan she had received his criminal referral for former CIA Director John Brennan\n   - The DOJ continues to employ Jared Wise, a Jan. 6 defendant caught on video yelling \"kill 'em\" at officers, who is working on a Weaponization Working Group\n\n4. **Trump's Reported Dissatisfaction:**\n   - A White House aide told NBC News that Trump has complained about Bondi to aides and allies in recent weeks, describing her as \"weak and insufficiently aggressive\"\n   - The White House issued statements from Trump and others (VP JD Vance, Chief of Staff Susie Wiles, Secretary of State Marco Rubio, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt) praising Bondi's performance\n   - Bondi and the DOJ face pressure from the White House to deliver victories on Trump's agenda, with frustration over perceived slow progress and court setbacks\n\n5. **Moment of Agreement:**\n   - Bondi and Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.) reached a moment of collegiality when discussing threats against lawmakers and their families\n   - Bondi stated: \"None of you should be threatened, ever. None of your children should be threatened. None of your families should be threatened.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://apnews.com/article/pam-bondi-house-judiciary-committee-justice-department-6d7502b80e42e9e9454264e242507bbd\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Bondi clashes with Democrats as she struggles to turn the page on Epstein files furor\"\n\n**Source:** AP News  \n**Date:** February 11, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Events:\n\n1. **Congressional Hearing:** Attorney General Pam Bondi testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday (February 11, 2026), approximately one year into her tenure.\n\n2. **Epstein Files Controversy:** The hearing focused heavily on the Justice Department's handling of Jeffrey Epstein files, which has been a persistent issue during Bondi's tenure. Epstein victims were seated in the hearing room during testimony.\n\n3. **Timeline of Epstein Files Release:**\n   - February 2025: Bondi distributed binders containing Epstein files to conservative influencers at the White House\n   - The binders contained no new revelations about Epstein\n   - July 2025: DOJ concluded a review and determined no Epstein \"client list\" existed\n   - Congress subsequently passed legislation demanding the Justice Department release the files\n\n4. **Redaction Problems:** A review by The Associated Press and other news organizations found \"countless examples of sloppy, inconsistent or nonexistent redactions\" that revealed sensitive private information, intimate details about victims, and included nude photographs.\n\n5. **Grand Jury Rebuke:** A day before the hearing, a grand jury in Washington refused to return an indictment that the Justice Department sought against Democratic lawmakers who produced a video urging military service members not to follow \"illegal orders.\"\n\n## Statements from Named Sources:\n\n**Pam Bondi (Attorney General):**\n- \"You sit here and you attack the president and I'm not going to have it. I am not going to put up with it.\"\n- Told Epstein victims she was \"deeply sorry\" for what they had suffered and that \"any accusation of criminal wrongdoing will be taken seriously and investigated\"\n- Called Rep. Jamie Raskin a \"washed-up loser lawyer \u2014 not even a lawyer\"\n- Called Rep. Thomas Massie a \"hypocrite\" with \"Trump derangement syndrome\"\n- Stated DOJ staff tried to do their \"very best in the time frame allotted by the legislation\"\n\n**Rep. Jamie Raskin (D-Maryland, top Democrat on committee):**\n- \"You're siding with the perpetrators and you're ignoring the victims. That will be your legacy unless you act quickly to change the course. You're running a massive Epstein cover-up right out of the Department of Justice.\"\n\n**Rep. Becca Balint (D-Vermont):**\n- \"This is pathetic. This is pathetic. I am not asking trick questions here. The American people have a right to know the answers to this.\"\n\n**Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio):**\n- \"What a difference a year makes. Under Attorney General Bondi, the DOJ has returned to its core missions \u2014 upholding the rule of law, going after the bad guys and keeping Americans safe.\"\n\n**Rep. Thomas Massie (R-Kentucky):**\n- \"Literally the worst thing you could do to survivors, you did.\"\n\n## Context:\n\n- The hearing occurred amid concerns that the Justice Department is using law enforcement powers to target political foes of President Trump\n- Republicans initiated the furor over the Epstein records\n- Bondi previously suggested in a Fox News interview last year that a client list was sitting on her desk for review; she later clarified she was referring to the Epstein files in total, not a specific client list\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cnn.com/2026/02/11/politics/5-takeaways-pam-bondi-house-testimony\">\n# Summary of CNN Article: \"Analysis: 5 takeaways from Pam Bondi's fiery testimony\"\n\n**Source:** CNN  \n**Date:** February 11, 2026  \n**Author:** Aaron Blake\n\n## Key Facts and Events:\n\n**Hearing Context:**\n- Attorney General Pam Bondi testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Wednesday (February 11, 2026)\n- The hearing addressed multiple DOJ issues including:\n  - Handling of Jeffrey Epstein files\n  - Failed indictments of six Democratic lawmakers (reported the day before the hearing)\n  - Killing of two protesters (Alex Pretti and Renee Good) by federal officers in Minneapolis\n\n**Testimony Characteristics:**\n- Described as \"some of the tensest and most combative testimony\" from a Trump Cabinet official to date\n- Bondi was extremely combative throughout, frequently talking over interrogators\n- Republican Chairman Jim Jordan had to repeatedly remind Bondi that questioning time belonged to members, not her\n- Bondi called one Democrat a \"washed up, loser lawyer\" and called Rep. Thomas Massie a \"failed politician\" and \"hypocrite\"\n\n**Key Exchanges:**\n\n1. **Epstein Files Redaction Failures:**\n   - Democratic Rep. Pramila Jayapal asked Epstein survivors in the audience to stand and requested Bondi apologize for DOJ's failures to redact survivors' sensitive personal information\n   - Bondi deflected to her predecessor Merrick Garland rather than apologizing, despite DOJ acknowledging these failures\n   - Bondi refused repeated requests to address survivors seated in the room\n\n2. **Exchange with Rep. Thomas Massie (Republican):**\n   - Massie questioned redaction of names of men suspected of criminal activity with Epstein, including billionaire Les Wexner\n   - Bondi claimed administration un-redacted Wexner's name \"within 40 minutes\"\n   - Massie clarified this only happened after he and Rep. Ro Khanna called it out: \"Within 40 minutes of me catching you red-handed\"\n\n3. **Exchange with Rep. Ted Lieu:**\n   - When Bondi claimed \"no evidence that Donald Trump has committed a crime,\" Lieu pointed to an unsubstantiated tip about Trump from Epstein files\n   - Lieu accused Bondi of lying under oath and called for her to resign\n\n**Public Opinion Data:**\n- A recent poll showed Americans disapprove about 3-to-1 of the administration's handling of the Epstein files\n- An NBC News poll released the morning of the hearing showed Trump's disapproval on immigration spiking to 60%\n\n**Political Context:**\n- The hearing occurred one day after news broke that the Trump DOJ tried and failed to indict six congressional Democrats\n- These were people Trump had suggested deserved prosecution\n- Republicans attempted to focus on Biden DOJ having subpoenaed call logs of congressional Republicans\n\n**Analysis Points:**\n- Author suggests Bondi was \"playing to the 'audience of one' \u2014 Trump\" potentially at the expense of appealing to the American public\n- The combativeness \"risked looking out of place and like she wasn't taking a serious issue seriously\"\n- Bondi's approach was characterized as coming \"to survive the hearing\" rather than directly addressing issues\n\n**Note:** The article text appears to be cut off at the end mid-sentence.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: List any scheduled media appearances, legal filings, campaign events, or public statements involving Pam Bondi dated between 2026-02-17 and 2026-02-28; summarize relevance and expected publicity.\nTime window examined: 17 Feb 2026 \u2013 28 Feb 2026.\n\n1.  Scheduled or Calendar-Certain Items\n\n   a.  U.S. Supreme Court \u2013 private conference on Friday 20 Feb  \n       \u2022 Case Vincent v. Bondi (No. 24-1155) is on the conference list for that date (Supreme Court docket, 13 Feb 2026).  \n       \u2022 Possible outcome: a same-day order (grant, deny, or \u201cGVR\u201d) released on the Court\u2019s website.  \n       \u2022 Publicity outlook: very low. The petition concerns an individual prisoner; Bondi appears only in her official capacity. Coverage, if any, will be confined to legal trade outlets and SCOTUS-watch blogs.\n\n   b.  Supreme Court opinion days announced for 20, 24, and 25 Feb (SCOTUSblog, 16 Feb 2026).  \n       \u2022 None of the argued cases on the February calendar list Bondi or the Department of Justice as a party.  \n       \u2022 Even if an opinion cites the attorney general, that would be incidental. Expected search impact: negligible.\n\n   c.  Possible filing deadlines in appellate matters tied to the dismissed prosecutions of James Comey and Letitia James.  Publicly available federal dockets still do not show briefing schedules that fall inside 17-28 Feb.  Should the Department file a notice of appeal or a first brief during the window, it would appear on PACER but is unlikely to create mainstream coverage absent an accompanying press conference.  Probable search impact: minimal.\n\n   d.  Congressional hearings  \n       \u2022 House Judiciary Committee\u2019s combative oversight session with Bondi occurred 11 Feb.  Updated committee calendar shows no follow-up hearing or deposition for 17-28 Feb (House Judiciary site, accessed 16 Feb 2026).  \n       \u2022 Written answers to members\u2019 questions are technically \u201cdue\u201d within 30 days but may be filed at any time; such submissions rarely receive standalone press coverage.\n\n   e.  Political conferences & campaign trail  \n       \u2022 CPAC 2026 agenda has not been posted; Ballotpedia\u2019s CPAC page lists only the 2025 conference that ended 22 Feb 2025 and names Bondi among last year\u2019s speakers (Ballotpedia, retrieved 16 Feb 2026).  No promotional material places the 2026 gathering during the target window, and no draft program lists Bondi.  \n       \u2022 GOP county-party event pages, Faith & Freedom Coalition calendar, and RNC Surrogate Booking sheets reviewed to 28 Feb show no Bondi appearance.  \n       \u2022 No Sunday-politics show guest grids (Meet the Press, Face the Nation, State of the Union, Fox News Sunday) released as of 16 Feb include Bondi for 23 Feb.\n\n   Result: As of this writing there is no firmly scheduled television interview, rally, speech, press availability, or court appearance by Pam Bondi between 17 Feb and 28 Feb 2026.\n\n2.  Recent but Still-Echoing Events Likely to Spill Into the Window\n\n   a.  11 Feb House Judiciary hearing  \n       \u2022 Generated extensive coverage and viral video clips (NBC News live blog 12 Feb 2026; LA Times commentary 13 Feb 2026; Al Jazeera recap 12 Feb 2026).  \n       \u2022 The hearing\u2019s aftershocks\u2014memes of Bondi\u2019s \u201cburn binder,\u201d social-media debates over her refusal to face Epstein survivors\u2014are still feeding cable-news round-tables.  \n       \u2022 Trend relevance: the episode produced the current Google Trends value of 19 (30-day chart).  Absent a fresh trigger, that spike is already decaying.\n\n   b.  DOJ \u201call files released\u201d letter (dated 15 Feb, first published Fox News Digital 15 Feb 2026).  \n       \u2022 Although technically outside the 17-28 Feb window, the 12-page letter\u2014and especially its list of 300+ famous names\u2014continues to be excerpted by talk-radio hosts and online influencers.  \n       \u2022 Potential echo: Bloggers or tabloid outlets could mine the name list for additional stories during the week of 17 Feb.  However, the original release has already saturated the news cycle; follow-up pieces are unlikely to surpass the first-round publicity.\n\n3.  Unscheduled/Contingent Triggers\n\n   \u2022 The Judiciary Committee left the transcript open for \u201cquestions for the record.\u201d  If Bondi submits written responses and a member leaks them, a one-day flare-up in political media could occur. Timing unpredictable.  \n   \u2022 Should the Department of Justice issue a high-profile press release\u2014e.g., an indictment, declination, or policy memo\u2014signed by Bondi, that could generate spotlight clips.  No such advisories are on the DOJ press calendar for the target period as of 16 Feb.\n\n4.  Expected Publicity and Google-Search Impact\n\n   \u2022 High-certainty drivers: none identified.  \n   \u2022 Moderate-certainty drivers: SCOTUS conference/orders (20 Feb) \u2013 but technical, low-reach; possible appellate paperwork \u2013 niche legal interest.  \n   \u2022 Low-certainty/organic drivers: continued commentary on the 11 Feb hearing; pundit mining of the 15 Feb Epstein-files letter; viral circulation of Bondi\u2019s 2014 anti-trafficking campaign ad noted by Caf\u00e9Mom (16 Feb 2026).\n\n   Quantitatively, the historical pattern for Bondi-related search interest shows quick spikes tied to televised confrontations, followed by steep drop-offs (example: her Senate testimony spike in Oct 2025 peaked at 100, fell below 20 within nine days).  With no fresh broadcast platform or scandal scheduled inside 17-28 Feb, the forecast is for either:\n\n   \u2022 a gradual reversion toward baseline (value change within \u00b13 points), or  \n   \u2022 a mild decline if media focus shifts to unrelated stories (e.g., the Supreme Court\u2019s birth-right-citizenship oral argument set for 1 Apr).\n\n   Either scenario fits the \u201cDoesn\u2019t change\u201d or \u201cDecreases\u201d outcomes under the resolution criteria, with an \u201cIncrease\u201d requiring an unforeseen event.\n\n5.  Remaining Information Gaps\n\n   \u2022 Sunday-show final guest rosters, typically released Thursday/Friday before the 23 Feb broadcasts.  \n   \u2022 DOJ press-office advisory list for late-February travel or speeches by the attorney general.  \n   \u2022 PACER docket activity for the Comey and Letitia James appeals, which could be updated at any time.  \n   \u2022 Any late-posted agendas for CPAC or regional conservative summits that might slide into the target window.\n\n   These gaps bear watching but, based on past lead times, the absence of any mention by 16 Feb strongly suggests no high-profile appearance has been booked.\n\nSummary Judgment for the Query:\nNo confirmed scheduled media appearances, legal filings with set deadlines, campaign events, or public statements by Pam Bondi fall between 17 Feb 2026 and 28 Feb 2026.  The only date-certain item involving her name is a Supreme Court conference on 20 Feb in a low-profile habeas case, unlikely to draw mainstream attention.  News coverage in the period is therefore expected to consist of residual discussion of the 11 Feb House hearing and the 15 Feb DOJ letter\u2014echoes that historically wane rather than grow\u2014making a significant upward shift in Google Trends interest improbable.</Agent_report>\n\n<GoogleTrendsData term=\"pam bondi\">\nGoogle Trends US data for \"pam bondi\" (last 90 days):\n\nCurrent value: 13\n90-day mean: 5.5\n90-day std dev: 13.3\n\nBASE RATE ANALYSIS (using 11-day windows to match question timeframe):\n- In 84% of 11-day windows, the value changed by \u22643 points (\"Doesn't change\")\n- In 10% of 11-day windows, the value INCREASED by >3 points\n- In 6% of 11-day windows, the value DECREASED by >3 points\n\nRecent trend: increasing (last 7 days avg: 42.0 vs prior 7 days: 2.6)\n\nDAILY VALUES (last 30 days):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-19,2\n2026-01-20,2\n2026-01-21,3\n2026-01-22,3\n2026-01-23,2\n2026-01-24,2\n2026-01-25,14\n2026-01-26,5\n2026-01-27,3\n2026-01-28,3\n2026-01-29,2\n2026-01-30,4\n2026-01-31,4\n2026-02-01,3\n2026-02-02,3\n2026-02-03,2\n2026-02-04,2\n2026-02-05,2\n2026-02-06,3\n2026-02-07,2\n2026-02-08,2\n2026-02-09,3\n2026-02-10,4\n2026-02-11,47\n2026-02-12,100\n2026-02-13,60\n2026-02-14,33\n2026-02-15,23\n2026-02-16,18\n2026-02-17,13\n\nNote: Google Trends values are relative (0-100 scale), not absolute search volumes.\n</GoogleTrendsData>\n"
