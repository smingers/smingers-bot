Analysis:

**Source Analysis:**

The sources can be categorized into three tiers:

**Tier 1 - High Quality, Recent, Factual:**
- **NVIDIA Newsroom (Feb 17, 2026):** Official announcement of $100B investment partnership with OpenAI. Factual, no speculation about IPO timing. Relevant as it provides alternative capital source that could delay IPO need.
- **Yahoo Finance/Fast Company (Jan 30, 2026):** Reports WSJ story citing anonymous sources about "informal talks" with banks and internal hiring. Moderate quality - second-hand reporting but from reputable outlets.
- **CNBC (Feb 12, 2026):** Explicitly states "no notable U.S. tech IPO filings yet in 2026" and "no timelines have been set" for OpenAI. High quality, factual.

**Tier 2 - Moderate Quality, Mixed Fact/Opinion:**
- **Alpha-sense (2026):** Aggregates broker research suggesting late 2026/early 2027 timing, $1T target valuation. Experts divided on timing. Moderate quality - unnamed experts but systematic methodology.
- **Lamartinierelawsoc (Feb 17, 2026):** Claims "completed audits and governance overhauls" signal S-1 filing "soon" but attributes to unnamed "insiders." Mixed factual data (revenue growth, valuation) with speculative timeline.
- **Trending Topics (Jan 7, 2026):** Reports "late 2026" speculation with $1T valuation target. Moderate quality aggregation piece.

**Tier 3 - Opinion/Analysis Heavy:**
- **MarketWatch/Morningstar (Feb 17, 2026):** Jeremy Grantham warning about IPO market overheating. Notes Scott Galloway suggested OpenAI "could be pulled" from IPO pipeline. Relevant for sentiment but speculative.
- **German sources (Feb 17, 2026):** Multiple articles warning of AI bubble, citing OpenAI's projected $14B loss in 2026. Opinion-heavy but factual on financial concerns.

**Key Factual Consensus from Sources:**
1. No S-1 filing as of Feb 17, 2026
2. NVIDIA partnership provides $100B alternative funding
3. OpenAI facing significant losses ($14B projected for 2026)
4. No confirmed underwriters or timeline
5. Market sentiment turning negative on tech IPOs

**Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence (Against >41%):**
- **NVIDIA $100B partnership (Feb 17):** This is a major alternative capital source announced TODAY (the forecast opening date). This significantly reduces urgency for IPO. Multiple sources confirm OpenAI's capital needs were a primary IPO driver. This partnership directly addresses that need. Weight: Very strong negative factor.
- **CNBC confirmation (Feb 12):** "No notable U.S. tech IPO filings yet in 2026" from reliable financial news source. Weight: Strong.
- **Multiple sources on financial losses:** German sources, MarketWatch all cite $14B+ losses for 2026. Makes IPO less attractive in near term. Weight: Strong.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Negative market sentiment shift (Feb 17):** Grantham warning, Galloway suggesting OpenAI "pulled," multiple bubble warnings. Could dampen community optimism. Weight: Moderate negative.
- **No concrete preparation signals:** Despite speculation since Oct 2025, still no underwriter mandates or filing activity. Weight: Moderate negative.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **"Insider" claims of imminent filing:** Unnamed sources in Lamartinierelawsoc. Weight: Weak positive (but contradicted by stronger evidence).

**Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction timeframe:** 10 days (Feb 17 to Feb 27, 2026)

This is an extremely short window. The question is NOT about whether OpenAI will IPO in 2026, but whether the Metaculus community prediction will rise above 41% in the next 10 days.

**Critical temporal factor:** The NVIDIA partnership was announced TODAY (Feb 17), the same day this forecast opens. The Metaculus community has NOT yet processed this information. This is a significant negative catalyst that should push the prediction DOWN, not up.

**If timeframe were halved (5 days):** Probability would drop to ~20% - insufficient time for any positive catalyst to emerge and be processed.

**If timeframe were doubled (20 days):** Probability might rise to ~40% - more time for unexpected positive news, though NVIDIA news would still dominate.

**Justification:**

My outside view base rate was 34%, based on analysis before considering today's news sources.

**Critical new information:** The NVIDIA $100B partnership announced Feb 17, 2026 is a game-changer. This provides OpenAI with massive alternative capital, directly addressing the primary reason cited for IPO urgency across multiple sources (Yahoo Finance, MarketWise, Alpha-sense all cited capital needs as key driver).

**How this shifts the base rate:**

The outside view assumed a ~35% chance of the prediction rising above 41%, based on:
- 20% chance of positive catalyst
- 15% chance of spontaneous drift upward

The NVIDIA announcement is NOT a positive catalyst for IPO probability - it's a negative one. It:
1. Reduces urgency for IPO by providing alternative funding
2. Extends runway, allowing OpenAI to delay IPO until more profitable
3. Strengthens Microsoft/NVIDIA partnership ecosystem, reducing need for public capital

**Expected community reaction:** When Metaculus forecasters update their predictions after processing the NVIDIA news (likely within 24-48 hours), the rational response is to LOWER their IPO probability estimates, not raise them. This makes it even less likely the community prediction will exceed 41%.

**Additional negative factors:**
- Grantham/Galloway warnings about IPO market (Feb 17)
- Continued absence of concrete filing preparation
- Financial loss projections making IPO less attractive

**Structural consideration:** Metaculus communities are generally efficient. The NVIDIA news is public, significant, and directly relevant. Forecasters will process it quickly. The direction of movement should be downward.

Probability calibration:

Starting from outside view base rate of 34%, I must adjust for:

1. **NVIDIA partnership (announced today):** This is a major negative catalyst for IPO probability, which should push community prediction DOWN. Effect: -15 percentage points
2. **Negative market sentiment (Feb 17 articles):** Multiple warnings about AI bubble, IPO market concerns. Effect: -5 percentage points
3. **Very short timeframe (10 days):** Less time for surprise positive catalyst. Effect: -2 percentage points

Adjusted probability: 34% - 15% - 5% - 2% = 12%

However, I must account for:
- Small possibility (~10%) that community doesn't fully process NVIDIA news or interprets it differently
- Possibility (~5%) of unexpected positive catalyst in next 10 days
- Measurement uncertainty

Final calibrated probability: 18%

This reflects high confidence that the NVIDIA partnership will push the community prediction down or keep it stable, making it unlikely to exceed 41%.

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Metaculus community prediction for "OpenAI IPO in 2026" exceed 41% on Feb 27? Currently at 41% on Feb 16, 10 days remain.

2. **Outside view base rate:** 34% (before considering today's NVIDIA news)

3. **Consistency check:** "18 out of 100 times, the Metaculus community prediction rises above 41% by Feb 27." This aligns with my justification that the NVIDIA partnership is a significant negative catalyst that should push predictions down.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence:**
   - NVIDIA $100B partnership announced Feb 17 (reduces IPO urgency)
   - CNBC confirmation of no 2026 tech IPO filings yet (Feb 12)
   - Multiple sources citing $14B+ OpenAI losses in 2026 (makes IPO less attractive)
   - Only 10 days for community to react and prediction to rise

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** OpenAI announces underwriter mandates or confidential S-1 filing in next 48 hours, creating positive surprise that overwhelms NVIDIA news. This would push probability to ~60%. However, given no preparation signals and NVIDIA partnership just announced, this seems very unlikely (<5% chance).

6. **Status quo outcome:** Current prediction is exactly 41%. Status quo is that it stays at 41% or drifts slightly down given negative news flow. The NVIDIA partnership reinforces downward pressure. My 18% probability appropriately reflects that status quo/downward movement is most likely.

Probability: 18%
