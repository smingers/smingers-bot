Analysis:

**Source Analysis:**

1. **Forge Global (Feb 16, 2026)**: Legal boilerplate only, no substantive IPO information. Quality: Irrelevant.

2. **Yahoo Finance/Fast Company (Jan 30, 2026)**: Reports WSJ anonymous sources claiming OpenAI in "informal talks" about potential 2026 IPO. Mentions staffing for investor relations. Quality: Moderate - mainstream outlet but relies on anonymous sources, no confirmation.

3. **Trending Topics (Jan 7, 2026)**: Speculative piece citing "late 2026" IPO possibility with $1T valuation target. No named sources. Quality: Low - speculation without attribution.

4. **Lamartinierelawsoc (Feb 17, 2026)**: Claims "late 2026 or early 2027" timing based on "Wall Street predictions" and "insiders." Mentions completed audits. Quality: Low-moderate - unclear sourcing, appears to be opinion/analysis site.

5. **Alpha-sense (undated, 2026)**: Broker research compilation noting experts "divided" on late 2026 vs early 2027 timing. Mentions $100B fundraise consideration. Quality: Moderate - aggregates professional opinions but lacks specific attribution.

6. **NVIDIA press release (Feb 17, 2026)**: Announces $100B investment in OpenAI infrastructure over time. No IPO mention. Quality: High - official announcement, but irrelevant to IPO timing.

7. **AskNews articles (various dates)**: Multiple articles from Feb 17, 2026 discussing AI investment concerns, circular financing risks, OpenAI losses ($14B in 2026 projected). Jeremy Grantham warns IPOs could destabilize markets. Scott Galloway suggests OpenAI "could be pulled" from IPO pipeline. Quality: Mixed - some credible sources (Grantham named), but mostly speculative.

**Critical fact**: No source reports an actual S-1 filing or imminent filing. All discussion remains speculative about "potential" or "possible" 2026 IPO.

**Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong evidence:**
- None. No S-1 filing exists as of Feb 17, 2026 (10 days before resolution date).
- Multiple sources confirm OpenAI faces significant financial challenges ($14B losses projected for 2026).

**Moderate evidence:**
- Recent negative sentiment: Scott Galloway's Feb 17 comment that OpenAI "could be pulled" from IPO pipeline suggests weakening 2026 prospects.
- NVIDIA's $100B investment announcement (Feb 17) provides alternative funding, potentially reducing IPO urgency.
- Jeremy Grantham's warning about IPO market risks (Feb 17) may dampen market appetite.

**Weak evidence:**
- Anonymous "informal talks" from January sources - now dated and unconfirmed.
- General speculation about "late 2026" timing without concrete milestones.

**Timeframe Analysis:**

Resolution date: Feb 27, 2026 (10 days from now). The question asks whether Metaculus CP will be >41.00% on that date.

Current CP: 41.00% (as of Feb 16).

**Key insight**: With only 10 days remaining and no S-1 filing, the underlying IPO question's probability should be declining, not rising. For the CP to rise above 41%, forecasters would need:
- Positive IPO news (S-1 filing or strong signals) - unlikely given recent negative coverage
- Random upward drift from forecast churn

If timeframe doubled (20 days): More opportunity for news-driven volatility, slightly higher chance of upward movement.
If timeframe halved (5 days): Less time for significant change, probability closer to 50% (pure noise).

**Justification for Inside View Adjustment:**

Starting from outside view base rate of 48.0% (essentially even odds with slight upward bias):

**Factors pushing DOWN (toward lower probability of CP rising):**
1. **Recent negative news cascade (Feb 17)**: Three separate articles on Feb 17 discuss AI investment concerns, OpenAI losses, and Galloway's "could be pulled" comment. This is fresh information likely to push forecasters toward lower IPO probability.
2. **No S-1 filing with 10 days left**: For 2026 IPO to occur, S-1 must be filed soon. Each passing day without filing makes 2026 less likely, pushing CP down.
3. **Alternative funding secured**: NVIDIA's $100B commitment reduces IPO urgency.

**Factors pushing UP:**
1. **Regression toward mean**: At exactly 41.00%, there's natural upward drift potential.
2. **Forecast decay**: Old pessimistic forecasts aging out could allow newer, more optimistic ones to dominate.

**Net assessment**: The Feb 17 negative news cluster is significant and recent. It directly addresses IPO viability concerns. This should push the underlying IPO probability down, which would push the CP down, making "CP rises above 41%" less likely.

However, the effect is modest because:
- 10 days is short for major CP shifts
- Starting exactly at 41.00% means even tiny upward noise crosses threshold
- No definitive "IPO cancelled" announcement

**Probability Calibration:**

Outside view: 48.0% (essentially even odds)

Inside view adjustments:
- Recent negative news (Feb 17): -5 percentage points
- No S-1 filing with limited time: -3 percentage points  
- Alternative funding reducing urgency: -2 percentage points
- Regression to mean from 41%: +3 percentage points
- High precision threshold (0.01% difference matters): +2 percentage points

Net adjustment: -5 percentage points

Inside view: 43%

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Metaculus community prediction for "OpenAI files IPO in 2026" exceed 41.00% on Feb 27, 2026? Currently at 41.00%.

2. **Base rate**: 48.0% from reference class of similar CP-rises questions over 10-day windows.

3. **Consistency**: "43 out of 100 times, the CP rises above 41.00%." This reflects slight bearish bias from recent negative news while acknowledging high baseline uncertainty.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Feb 17 negative news cluster (Galloway, Grantham, loss projections) - factually documented
   - No S-1 filing as of Feb 17 with 10 days remaining - verified fact
   - NVIDIA $100B investment announced Feb 17 - official press release
   - Starting exactly at 41.00% creates low threshold for "rise" - mathematical fact

5. **Blind spot**: Surprise S-1 filing in next 10 days would dramatically shift CP upward, making my forecast look too pessimistic. However, no signals suggest this is imminent. Probability of this scenario: ~10%.

6. **Status quo**: Current CP is 41.00%. Status quo (no change) = "No" resolution. Recent news momentum is negative, suggesting slight downward pressure more likely than upward. My 43% already incorporates modest status quo bias.

Probability: 43%
