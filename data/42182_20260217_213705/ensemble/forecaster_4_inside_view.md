Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (condensed)  
1. Yahoo Finance/Fast Company (2026-01-30) – cites WSJ: OpenAI in informal talks with banks, hiring IR staff for a possible 2026 IPO.  Reliable mainstream outlet; facts are anonymous-source, so moderate strength.  
2. Lamartinierelawsoc (2026-02-17) – analyst roundup: “late 2026 or early 2027” most likely; no S-1 yet.  Mixed fact/opinion; only moderate weight.  
3. Alpha-Sense broker note (2026-02-??) – consensus of street analysts: IPO window “late 2026 / early 2027”; gives valuation figures.  Paid-research, methodology described, so moderate.  
4. NVIDIA newsroom (2026-02-16) – huge $100 B cap-ex partnership; may **delay** need for IPO cash.  Primary source, high quality, but only indirect to IPO timing.  
5. CNBC & other macro pieces (Feb 2026) – no large U.S. tech S-1s filed YTD, IPO market still warming.  High quality; moderate evidence against “imminent” filing.  
6. Metaculus site check (agent report) – CP drifted from mid-40s → 41%; no EDGAR filing as of 16 Feb.  Factual, high quality for our purpose.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong:  
• No public or confidential S-1 in EDGAR – structural fact; sharply limits chance of near-term catalyst.  
Moderate:  
• Multiple reliable outlets say “late 2026 / 2027” rather than “soon”; implies downward/flat sentiment.  
• 10-gigawatt NVIDIA deal supplies capital, reducing urgency to file.  
Weak (small upward pull):  
• WSJ report of bank talks and finance-team hiring – classic pre-IPO breadcrumb but not time-specific.  
• General 2026 IPO-boom narrative could lift sentiment a little.  

Net evidence direction: Slightly negative to status-quo.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
We are 10.5 days from the scoring timestamp (27 Feb 2026).  On Metaculus, 10-day CP moves for mid-probability tech-IPO questions typically stay within ±3 pp (sd≈1.5 pp).  If the horizon were halved (≈5 days) I’d trim 1-2 pp off σ, reducing the chance of any threshold cross; if doubled (≈20 days) I’d widen σ to ≈2.2 pp and inch the probability of a move above 41 % up by ~3 pp.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base-rate model: mean ∆CP = −0.2 pp (mild downward drift), σ = 1.5 pp.  Continuously-distributed normal gives P(∆>0) ≈ 44.7 %.  
Adjustments:  
• Discrete rounding (CP displayed to 0.01) puts non-trivial mass on “exactly 41.00” which resolves “No” – down 2 pp.  
• Recent negative-tone news and fresh capital infusion (NVIDIA) both tilt sentiment slightly downward – down 1 pp.  
• Low but non-zero chance of a surprise credible leak (“banks formally mandated”) that could spike CP a few points – add back 1 pp.  

Final inside-view probability ≈ 42 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that about 42 times in 100 questions like this, the community prediction will finish strictly above 41.00 % on the stated date.”

Checklist:
1. Restatement – “Between now (17 Feb) and 27 Feb 2026, will the Metaculus CP for ‘OpenAI IPO in 2026’ end > 41 %?” ✓  
2. Outside view base = 44.7 %; final anchored. ✓  
3. Consistency line already written above. ✓  
4. Key evidence (≤20 w each):  
   – No S-1 visible in EDGAR.  
   – Several outlets shift expected IPO to late-26/27.  
   – NVIDIA $100 B deal reduces cash urgency.  
   – CP drifted down to 41 % over past month.  
   – Short 10-day window, platform inertia.  
5. Blind-spot: Big scoop (e.g., Bloomberg: “OpenAI hires Morgan Stanley, JPM for summer IPO”) breaks within a week and lifts CP >45 %. Would raise probability by ~15 pp.  
6. Status-quo (CP unchanged) resolves “No”; inertia bias included. ✓

Probability: 42%
