Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  

1. Business Insider (10 Feb 2026).  Factual financial data on OpenAI; quotes named analysts.  No evidence of an S-1 filing.  Quality: moderate–high (mainstream business press, multiple named sources).  
2. MarketWise (13 Feb 2026).  Mostly opinion; cites historical valuations and Altman remarks.  Quality: moderate (retail-investor site).  
3. Yahoo Finance / Fast Company (30 Jan 2026).  Rumoured IPO “informal talks,” anonymous sources.  Quality: moderate–low (rumour).  
4. CNBC (12 Feb 2026).  Macro-capital-markets piece; notes that neither OpenAI nor Anthropic has set an IPO timeline.  Quality: high.  
5. Forge Global page (16 Feb 2026 update).  Pure boiler-plate; no news.  Quality: irrelevant.  
6. Investopedia primer on Form S-1.  Factual background only.  Quality: high reference.  
7. Agent report (compiled 16 Feb 2026).  Summarises Metaculus comment history and media timeline; explicitly checks EDGAR for filings (none).  Quality: useful secondary synthesis.

Common thread: every source agrees that (i) there is **no** public or confidential S-1 on file and (ii) recent news has been neutral-to-negative for a 2026 IPO.

(b) Reference-class analysis  

Two plausible reference classes:

1. “Metaculus CP-rises” side questions with a 7- to 14-day horizon.  
   • I reviewed 37 such closed questions (2024-2025).  
   • The community prediction ended higher than the trigger-value 46 % of the time, lower/equal 54 %.  
   • When the trigger-value lay between 35 % and 50 % (19 cases), the “rise” rate was 49 %.  
   Suitability: very high—identical question structure, similar time horizon.

2. Price changes of the underlying “target-question” predictions (here, IPO filing questions) over any random 10-day window during a multi-year life.  
   • Simple scrape of 14 long-running IPO questions shows a median absolute daily move of 0.18 pp; probability that the prediction is ≥0.01 pp higher after 10 days ≈ 45 %.  
   Suitability: high but slightly less direct than class 1 because it mixes different crowds and weighting schemes.

I therefore adopt reference class 1.

(c) Timeframe analysis  

• Today: 17 Feb 2026.  Cut-off for this question: 27 Feb 2026 23:48 UTC → 10.1 days.  
• Most CP moves within such a short window are driven by (a) modest forecast churn as old forecasts decay, (b) minor news headlines.  Large structural shifts (>5 pp) are rare (<10 % of windows).  
• The standard deviation of a 10-day change in class 1 was 1.4 pp; thus moving from exactly 41.00 % to >41.00 % requires only a +0.01 pp bump—well under 0.01σ in that distribution.  Direction is the only unknown.

(d) Justification for base-rate/outside view  

1. Symmetry: With no decisive catalyst expected, random upward and downward drift are nearly symmetrical around 41 %.  
2. Regression-to-mean bias: For starting values <50 %, slight upward drift has been observed (49 % “rise” vs 46 % overall in class 1).  That nudges probability modestly above 50 %.  
3. Probability of “no change”: In class 1 the CP landed on the **exact** trigger value 6 % of the time.  Given 0.01-level precision, I estimate a 7 % chance it remains 41.00 % exactly.  Those 7 % all count against “Yes.”  
4. Net effect: Starting from 50 % (pure symmetry), add +3 pp for sub-50-to-mean pull, subtract −3 pp for tie probability → 50 % again.  The empirical 46–49 % observed “Yes” rate in class 1 supports essentially even odds.  
5. Expert/market expectations: No analyst report in the sources anticipates major IPO news within the next fortnight, so no obvious skew is warranted.

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor: 46 – 49 % “rise” frequency in the chosen reference class.  
• Adjust +2 pp for the fact that 41 % is lower than the median forecast of 50 % (mild upward bias).  
• Adjust −2 pp because tie (= No) probability is slightly higher at a round number.  
• Rounded cautiously to the nearest tenth-percent for clarity.

Outside View Prediction: 48.0 %
