Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, newest first)
1. Lamartinierelawsoc, 17 Feb 2026 – Long “IPO-watch” blogpost mixing attributed Wall Street analyst quotes with heavy author speculation.  Recent, but quality is uneven; factual items (OpenAI audit completed, valuation ≥ $500 B) are useful; forward-looking opinions only lightly weighted.  
2. Morningstar/MarketWatch, 17 Feb 2026 – Jeremy Grantham interview.  High-credibility commentator, but piece mainly offers macro opinion (“megacap IPOs could sink S&P”).  No hard news on an imminent OpenAI filing.  
3. Forge Global legal-disclaimer page, 16 Feb 2026 – Boiler-plate; zero informational value on IPO timing.  
4. Yahoo Finance (Fast Company reprint), 30 Jan 2026 – Cites Wall Street Journal reporting of “informal talks” with banks and hiring of CFO/IR staff.  One independent, named journalistic source; moderate quality.  
5. TrendingTopics, 07 Jan 2026 – Round-up of 2026 IPO candidates; repeats late-2026 OpenAI target.  Secondary, lightly sourced.  
6. AlphaSense broker note (Dec 2025 extract) – Aggregated sell-side analyst consensus: OpenAI IPO “late 2026/early 2027”.  Single professional source, clear methodology; moderate weight.  
7. NVIDIA newsroom, 16 Feb 2026 – Official press release on $100 B compute partnership.  Very reliable, but no direct IPO signal; may reduce near-term capital-raising urgency.  
8. Remaining AskNews articles (Motley Fool, Nikkei, Euronews, etc.) – Macro commentary on AI spending & IPO climate; helpful for sentiment but low specific relevance to a 10-day forecast of the Metaculus number.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence
• None – no document confirms a concrete SEC filing, underwriting mandate, or board resolution within the next fortnight.

Moderate evidence
• Multiple mainstream outlets (WSJ via Yahoo Fin, AlphaSense brokers, TrendingTopics) independently place expected S-1 timing in late-2026 or 2027 → pushes sentiment very slightly down.
• NVIDIA’s 10 GW/$100 B partnership (press release) signals sizeable non-public funding → marginally lowers perceived need for an early IPO.

Weak evidence
• Grantham & other pundits warn of “IPO bubble” → may nudge retail forecasters bearish but historically has small immediate effect.
• Blog chatter that “audits complete, S-1 soon” → anecdotal, easily discounted.

Net directional pull: modestly downward (–1 to –1.5 percentage points on the community prediction).

(c) Time-frame analysis
Prediction horizon: 10.1 days (to 27 Feb 2026 23:48 UTC).  
If horizon were halved (≈5 days) probability of a ≥0.01 pp uptick would fall ~3 points because fewer user updates occur; if doubled to 20 days, probability would rise ~4 points owing to greater chance of a rumour burst.

(d) Justification / inside-view update
Outside-view baseline (derived from historical 10-day moves for ≈40 % Metaculus binaries): 40 %.  
Adjustments:
1. Recent micro-drift is slightly negative (–0.3 pp over past week) … –2 pp.  
2. Tie-loses rule (exactly 41.00 % counts “No”) –1 pp.  
3. Low but non-zero chance (~12 %) of a surprise positive rumour jump ≥1 pp … +3 pp.  
4. Lack of hard catalysts & NVIDIA funding reduces IPO imminence perception … –1 pp.

Sum: 40 –2 –1 +3 –1 = 39 %.

Interpretation: In 39 of 100 comparable 10-day windows the community prediction would finish above 41.00 %.

Probability calibration
Final inside-view probability that the Metaculus community prediction exceeds 41.00 % at the specified timestamp: 39 %.

Checklist:
1. Title paraphrase – “Will Metaculus CP for ‘OpenAI IPO 2026’ be > 41 % on 27 Feb 2026 23:48 UTC?”  
2. Outside-view base rate used: 40 %.  
3. Consistency line – “39 out of 100 times, the CP ends above 41.00 %.”  
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each):  
   • No SEC filing; analysts peg IPO to late-2026/27.  
   • NVIDIA invests $100 B, easing near-term cash need.  
   • CP drifted −0.3 pp last week.  
   • Tie-rule makes 41.00 % a loss.  
5. Blind-spot – A leak that OpenAI secretly submitted a confidential S-1 tomorrow could spike CP >45 %.  
6. Status-quo outcome favours minimal change → leans “No”.

Probability: 39%
