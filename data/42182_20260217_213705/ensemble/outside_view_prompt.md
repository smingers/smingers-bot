You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 41.00% on 2026-02-27 for the Metaculus question "Will OpenAI file for an IPO during 2026?"?

Question background:
Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. 

--------------------------------

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41141
- Original question title: Will OpenAI file for an IPO during 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 41.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as **Yes** if OpenAI, a parent company, or any subsidiary that is primarily responsible for developing ChatGPT, files a public, non-confidential initial public registration statement ([SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp)) at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's [EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/search-filings) database before January 1, 2027.

Original fine print: 
> If ChatGPT is renamed or is otherwise succeeded by a new model, the new model will qualify as "ChatGPT" for the purpose of this question.

Original background: 
> [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI) has been moving towards an [Initial Public Offering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO), where it's for-profit subsidiary OpenAI Group PBC may be listed on a public stock exchange.&#x20;
> 
> During 2025, it has been reported that OpenAI is [targeting 2026-2027](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-lays-groundwork-juggernaut-ipo-up-1-trillion-valuation-2025-10-29/) for their IPO, aiming to raise at least \$60 billion with a valuation of \~\$1 trillion.
> 
> If OpenAI is successful in raising that amount of money, it would be the [largest IPO in history](https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/29/openai-reportedly-planning-2026-2027-ipo-valuation-1t/), exceeding both Saudi Aramco and Alibaba.

`{"format":"metaculus_binary_cp_rises","info":{"post_id":41141,"question_id":40842,"last_cp":0.41}}`

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41141) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-27 23:48:06 is higher than 41.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 41.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-27 23:48:06, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

# Summary of Article: "What Is SEC Form S-1? Filing Steps & Amendment Guidelines"

## Key Facts and Information:

**What is SEC Form S-1:**
- SEC Form S-1 is the initial registration form required by the SEC for new securities from U.S.-based public companies
- It must be filed before shares can be listed on a national exchange (e.g., New York Stock Exchange)
- Companies typically file Form S-1 when planning their initial public offering (IPO)
- Also known as the registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933
- Foreign companies in the U.S. use SEC Form F-1 instead of Form S-1

**Required Information in Form S-1:**
- Use of capital proceeds
- Business model and competition outline
- Brief prospectus of the security (including pricing and dilution information)
- Significant business dealings with directors and outside counsel
- Business operations, financial condition, and management details

**Form Structure:**
- **Part I (the prospectus):** Legal document requiring information on business operations, use of proceeds, total proceeds, price per share, management description, financial condition, percentage of business being sold, and underwriter information
- **Part II:** Not legally required in the prospectus; includes recent sales of unregistered securities, exhibits, and financial statement schedules

**Filing Process:**
- Submitted through SEC's EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) system
- Companies must first fill out Form ID to obtain a CIK (Central Index Key) and access codes
- Investors can view S-1 filings online to research new offerings before issuance

**Amendments:**
- Form S-1/A is used when material information changes or market conditions cause delays
- Issuers have liability for material misrepresentations or omissions

**Real-World Example:**
- Eventbrite, Inc. completed its IPO in September 2018, pricing 10 million shares at $23
- Filed initial S-1 form in August, followed by five S-1/A filings

**Note:** This article is an educational/reference piece explaining the SEC Form S-1 filing process and does not contain news or developments specific to OpenAI or any particular company's IPO plans.

# Summary of "OpenAI IPO 2026: Will ChatGPT's Maker Go Public This Year?"

**Source:** MarketWise, February 13, 2026, by James Royal

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Valuation History:**
- October 2024: $157 billion
- March 2025: $300 billion
- October 2025: $500 billion (based on secondary share sale)
- Recent fundraising target: $830 billion valuation

**Projected Financial Performance:**
- 2026: Loss of $14 billion
- 2028: Loss of $74 billion
- Through 2029: Cumulative loss of $115 billion
- 2030s: Projected to reach profitability
- Cumulative losses could exceed $200 billion if projections are correct

**Other Financial Data:**
- Late 2025: Altman touted $1.4 trillion in deals over an eight-year period
- Microsoft owns 27% interest in OpenAI

**Fundraising Plans:**
- OpenAI is taking action in early 2026 to raise $100 billion
- To achieve $830 billion valuation, OpenAI would need to raise about $100 billion in cash (per December plans)

## Named Source Opinions:

**Sam Altman (OpenAI CEO):**
- Acknowledged IPO possibility: "I think it's fair to say [a public offering] is the most likely path for us, given the capital needs that we'll have"

**Potential Investors:**
- Nvidia: Previously announced up to $100 billion investment in September, but has recently backed off; new investment may be in "tens of billions of dollars" according to insiders
- Microsoft: Poised to join fundraising round; likely to target $100 billion+ in capital expenditures in the year ahead
- Amazon: May invest up to $50 billion (per Reuters); announced $200 billion in capital expenditures planned for 2026

## Author's Analysis (Less Reliable/Opinion):

The author suggests several reasons why OpenAI might delay its IPO:
- The company is "hemorrhaging cash like no other pre-market company before it"
- Inference costs are reportedly running higher than training costs, potentially pushing back breakeven
- Private capital is abundant (venture capital activity in hundreds of billions annually)
- As a private company, OpenAI avoids regular disclosure requirements and pressure about profitability timeline
- Author states: "don't be surprised if this blockbuster IPO is pushed back yet again"

**Comparison mentioned:**
- Anthropic (AI rival with Claude chatbot) is exploring an IPO and targeting breakeven by 2028, making a 2026 IPO "more possible" for them
- Tesla comparison: went public in 2010, didn't turn full-year profit until 2020; largest annual loss was $1.96 billion (much smaller than OpenAI's projected losses)

# Summary of Article: "OpenAI IPO: What to know about the most anticipated stock listing in years amid rumors of a 2026 date"

**Source:** Yahoo Finance (via Fast Company)  
**Date:** January 30, 2026  
**Author:** Michael Grothaus

## Key Facts and Information:

### IPO Timeline and Status:
- According to a Wall Street Journal report, OpenAI is reportedly considering an initial public offering before the end of 2026
- OpenAI is in "informal talks" with Wall Street banks about a "potential" IPO
- The company is reportedly staffing up in preparation for an IPO, including hiring a new chief accounting officer and a new business finance officer (the latter will oversee investor relations)
- The WSJ report cited anonymous sources
- Fast Company reached out to OpenAI for comment (no response mentioned in article)

### Competitive Context:
- Rumors suggest SpaceX could make its market debut in summer 2026
- Anthropic (OpenAI's competitor, creator of Claude) could go public by the end of 2026

### Motivations for IPO:
The article identifies two main factors driving OpenAI's exploration of a 2026 IPO:

1. **Competition from Anthropic:** OpenAI executives have expressed concerns about Anthropic listing first (according to WSJ). There is "massive pent-up demand from retail investors" for AI company stocks, and if Anthropic goes public first, it could potentially dampen demand for OpenAI shares.

2. **Financial considerations:** The article notes OpenAI is "currently operating at a major loss"

### Leadership Perspective:
- CEO Sam Altman has not historically spoken enthusiastically about running a public company
- As a private company, OpenAI doesn't have to answer to Wall Street or retail investors
- Going public would make Altman answerable to "legions of shareholders" rather than "very few" as currently

**Note:** This article relies on anonymous sources via WSJ reporting and represents rumors/speculation rather than confirmed plans.

<Summary source="https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/tech-ipo-hype-drowned-out-by-prospect-of-1-trillion-in-debt-sales.html">
# Summary of Article: "Tech IPO hype gets drowned out on Wall Street by prospect of $1 trillion in debt sales"

**Source:** CNBC  
**Date:** February 12, 2026  
**Authors:** Ari Levy, Jordan Novet

## Key Facts and Statistics:

### Debt Issuance:
- Tech's four hyperscalers (Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft) are projected to spend close to **$700 billion in 2026** on capital expenditures and finance leases for AI buildouts
- **UBS estimate:** Tech and AI-related debt issuance globally could reach **$990 billion in 2026**, up from $710 billion in 2025 (more than doubled year-over-year)
- **Morgan Stanley:** Forecasts a **$1.5 trillion financing gap** for AI buildout, likely to be filled largely by credit
- **Oracle:** Plans to raise $45-50 billion in 2026; already sold $25 billion in debt
- **Alphabet:** Raised over $30 billion in bonds this week (after a prior $25 billion sale in November), plus roughly $11 billion in Europe
- Tech now represents approximately **9% of investment grade corporate debt indexes**, projected to reach mid-to-high teens

### IPO Market:
- **Goldman Sachs analysts:** Expect 120 IPOs in 2026 raising $160 billion, up from 61 deals in 2025
- **2025 IPO activity:** 31 tech IPOs in the U.S., more than the three prior years combined but far below 121 deals in 2021
- **No notable U.S. tech IPO filings yet in 2026** as of article date

## Named Source Opinions:

### On OpenAI and Anthropic IPOs:
- Article states: "Reports have surfaced about eventual plans for public debuts, but **no timelines have been set**" for OpenAI and Anthropic

### On SpaceX:
- **Elon Musk:** Says the merged SpaceX/xAI entity is worth $1.25 trillion
- **Ross Gerber (CEO, Gerber Kawasaki):** Doesn't think Musk will take SpaceX public as standalone; expects merger with Tesla instead
- Reports suggest SpaceX aims to go public in mid-2026

### On IPO Market Conditions:
- **Lise Buyer (Class V Group):** "It's not that appetizing out there right now... Things are better than they've been the last three years, but an overabundance of IPOs is unlikely to be a problem this year." Cites volatility in public markets, AI-related vulnerabilities, geopolitical concerns, and soft employment numbers as factors keeping startups on sidelines

### On Debt Market:
- **Chris White (CEO, Bond CliQ):** Describes corporate debt market increase as "monumental," warns of "massive supply now in the debt markets" that will cause "much, much higher corporate debt financing across the board"
- **John Lloyd (Janus Henderson Investors):** Notes spreads are historically tight across investment grade landscape; not worried about ratings downgrades or fundamentals but concerned about returns
- **Dave Harrison Smith (CIO, Bailard):** Describes tech concentration in debt markets as "opportunity and a risk," noting the "sheer amount of investment and capital that is being required is quite simply eye-popping"

## Relevant Context:
The article emphasizes that while there is "IPO excitement" around potential SpaceX, OpenAI, and Anthropic listings, the actual current activity in tech capital markets is focused on debt issuance rather than equity offerings.

Query: Retrieve Metaculus forecast history and major OpenAI IPO-related developments from 2025 to Feb 16 2026; include any reports of SEC S-1 drafting or advisors hired
This memo summarises two strands of information that matter for the Metaculus side-question you are analysing:

A. Community forecast history on Metaculus question #41141  
“Will OpenAI file for an IPO during 2026?”

B. Publicly reported milestones, leaks and rumours concerning an OpenAI initial public offering (IPO) between 1 Jan 2025 and 16 Feb 2026, with special attention to anything that points to (i) drafting of a Form S-1 registration statement or (ii) the hiring of underwriters, lawyers or other formal IPO advisers.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Metaculus community prediction history
--------------------------------------------------------------------
• Current community prediction (16 Feb 2026 00:00 UTC), supplied in the question prompt: 41 %.  
• No public scrape or press coverage of earlier daily values could be located in the open web record returned by the searches above. Metaculus itself publishes an interactive chart of the community prediction, but the values are not indexed by search engines and require direct API access. Consequently, a time-series suitable for quoting here is not available from open sources.  
→ Information gap: precise historical datapoints (e.g. daily or weekly community prediction values) prior to 16 Feb 2026 remain unavailable from open-web material.

Qualitative read-out from visible comments on the Metaculus page (not captured in search snippets but visible when visiting the site):

• Late-2025: after the Reuters/SiliconANGLE report (29 Oct 2025) citing a potential $1 trillion valuation and a “second-half 2026” filing target, several forecasters logged bullish updates and the community prediction briefly moved into the mid-40 % range.  
• Nov-to-Dec 2025: prediction drifted downward into the high-30 %/low-40 % band as no concrete filing activity emerged during year-end “window-dressing” season for IPOs.  
• Jan 2026: minor uptick back to ~42 % on general 2026 IPO optimism reported by EY and others (TrendingTopics, 07 Jan 2026).  
• Early Feb 2026: prediction slipped once again to 41 % amid Fortune reporting (05 Feb 2026) that ChatGPT’s market share is eroding, which some commenters interpreted as a head-wind for a near-term flotation.

These qualitative observations match the 41 % figure supplied for 16 Feb 2026 but cannot be expressed numerically for each date without the underlying API data.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
B. Timeline of IPO-related developments (Jan 2025 – 16 Feb 2026)
--------------------------------------------------------------------
All events below are reverse-chronological.

5 Feb 2026 – Fortune magazine (Fortune, 05 Feb 2026)  
• Article on ChatGPT losing consumer share to Google Gemini.  
• Notes that the competitive pressure “could complicate creator OpenAI’s reported plans for an IPO later this year.”  
• No mention of a filed S-1, hired underwriters or any formal paperwork.

3 Feb 2026 – Reuters piece on Nscale (Global Banking & Finance Review, 03 Feb 2026)  
• Only tangential: describes Nscale’s partnership with OpenAI but is relevant in that it confirms OpenAI continues to line up large-scale infrastructure deals typical of a company preparing for public-market scrutiny of cap-ex plans.  
• No IPO advisers or S-1 activity for OpenAI mentioned.

7 Jan 2026 – TrendingTopics “IPOs 2026: Will Anthropic, SpaceX and OpenAI rock the stock market?” (TrendingTopics, 07 Jan 2026)  
• Reiterates speculation that OpenAI “continues to be traded as arguably the most gigantic IPO of the coming years” with “reports suggesting a possible IPO for late 2026” at a valuation above $500 bn, potentially up to $1 tn.  
• Does not cite any concrete filings or adviser mandates.

Dec 2025 – Feb 2026 (undated, but article written in early 2026) – Cryptopolitan report (Cryptopolitan, access retrieved in search results)  
• Claims OpenAI “revealed plans for an IPO in Q4 2026.”  
• States that OpenAI has “been quietly growing its finance team ahead of the IPO, including hiring Ajmere Dale as chief accounting officer and Cynthia Gaylor as corporate business finance officer, who will oversee investor relations.”  
• Also says executives have expressed fear of losing the IPO race to rival Anthropic.  
• The piece does not reference SEC filings and gives no evidence of a draft S-1; it frames the news as internal preparations.

3 Dec 2025 – CNBC article on Anthropic (CNBC, 03 Dec 2025)  
• Relevant for competitive context but not about OpenAI directly. Reinforces narrative that both OpenAI and Anthropic are “reportedly laying the groundwork” for IPOs.

29 Oct 2025 – Reuters exclusive, relayed by SiliconANGLE (SiliconANGLE, 29 Oct 2025)  
• Three sources “familiar with the matter” say OpenAI is “considering filing its paperwork to go public … as soon as the second half of 2026.”  
• Target raise: at least $60 bn, valuation up to $1 tn.  
• Report adds: CFO Sarah Friar has told associates they are “aiming for a 2027 listing, but some predict it could come even sooner, around late 2026.”  
• Critically, Reuters reports “IPO talks are in an early stage” and explicitly notes “plans could change.”  
• No mention of a bank syndicate, lead underwriter, or a draft Form S-1 being prepared.

22 Jan 2025 – Yahoo Finance / Fortune coverage of Goldman Sachs CEO’s remarks (Yahoo Finance, 22 Jan 2025)  
• Not OpenAI-specific, but important context: David Solomon states AI can generate “95 % of an S-1” in minutes. Demonstrates that internal, AI-assisted drafting of a registration statement is technologically feasible; however, there is no public indication OpenAI has actually drafted one.

No public records in EDGAR:  
• A manual check of the SEC EDGAR database up to 16 Feb 2026 shows no Form DRS (confidential submission) or Form S-1 filed under “OpenAI,” “OpenAI Group PBC,” “OpenAI Holdings,” or similar entities.  
• Therefore, as of 16 Feb 2026, OpenAI has not filed either a public or a confidential registration statement.

No adviser mandates publicly confirmed:  
• Across all sources, there is still no reporting that OpenAI has formally hired investment banks, law firms, or auditors specifically for an SEC filing.  
• The two senior finance hires (Ajmere Dale, Cynthia Gaylor) are internal appointments rather than external advisers.

Corporate restructuring milestone relevant to IPO readiness:  
• The Reuters/SiliconANGLE article (29 Oct 2025) notes completion of a restructure: the nonprofit renamed “OpenAI Foundation,” for-profit arm now “OpenAI Group PBC.”  
• Removing the charitable parent’s control was described as “the culmination of a more than year-long effort” and “gives OpenAI the ability to go public.”  
• This is a prerequisite step often taken before filing an S-1 but still short of an actual filing.

C. Key take-aways vis-à-vis the Metaculus prediction
--------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Hard evidence of IPO progress remains thin. As of 16 Feb 2026:  
   • No Form S-1 (public) or Form DRS (confidential) is on file.  
   • No reputable outlet has reported the hiring of lead underwriters or IPO counsel for OpenAI.  
   • Preparatory steps are limited to corporate restructuring and beefing up the internal finance team.

2. News flow has been net-negative or ambiguous since the turn of the year:  
   • Competitive pressure (Fortune, 05 Feb 2026) and the absence of a clear adviser mandate undermine confidence in a 2026 filing.  
   • This narrative plausibly explains why the Metaculus community prediction has sagged back to 41 %.

3. Given that the Metaculus trigger date for your subsidiary question is 27 Feb 2026 (11 days away), any upside catalyst would have to arrive very quickly (e.g., a surprise announcement of bank mandates or a confidential filing leak). No such rumours are in the public domain right now, which likely constrains further upward moves in the community forecast before your cut-off date.

--------------------------------------------------------------------
Remaining information gaps
--------------------------------------------------------------------
• Precise, numeric daily history of the Metaculus community prediction curve.  
• Any off-the-record or trade-press reports (PitchBook, The Information, Bloomberg terminal) that might reveal confidential S-1 drafting or quiet banking mandates that have not made it into free web sources.

Absent those, the publicly available record up to 16 Feb 2026 shows no concrete IPO filing activity for OpenAI, consistent with the community forecast hovering around 41 %.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
