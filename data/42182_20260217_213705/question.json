    "description": "Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41141\n- Original question title: Will OpenAI file for an IPO during 2026?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 41.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> This question will resolve as **Yes** if OpenAI, a parent company, or any subsidiary that is primarily responsible for developing ChatGPT, files a public, non-confidential initial public registration statement ([SEC Form S-1](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/s/sec-form-s-1.asp)) at the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's [EDGAR](https://www.sec.gov/search-filings) database before January 1, 2027.\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> If ChatGPT is renamed or is otherwise succeeded by a new model, the new model will qualify as \"ChatGPT\" for the purpose of this question.\n\nOriginal background: \n> [OpenAI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenAI) has been moving towards an [Initial Public Offering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_public_offering) (IPO), where it's for-profit subsidiary OpenAI Group PBC may be listed on a public stock exchange.&#x20;\n> \n> During 2025, it has been reported that OpenAI is [targeting 2026-2027](https://www.reuters.com/business/openai-lays-groundwork-juggernaut-ipo-up-1-trillion-valuation-2025-10-29/) for their IPO, aiming to raise at least \\$60 billion with a valuation of \\~\\$1 trillion.\n> \n> If OpenAI is successful in raising that amount of money, it would be the [largest IPO in history](https://siliconangle.com/2025/10/29/openai-reportedly-planning-2026-2027-ipo-valuation-1t/), exceeding both Saudi Aramco and Alibaba.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41141,\"question_id\":40842,\"last_cp\":0.41}}`",

If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-27 23:48:06 is higher than 41.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 41.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled.
