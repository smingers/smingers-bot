Analysis:
The Metaculus community forecast will react mostly to concrete signals that OpenAI is (or is not) preparing to go public in 2026.  Relevant information includes:  
• Any statement from OpenAI, its board, or CEO Sam Altman about IPO timing, fundraising alternatives, or staying private.  
• Leaked or announced work on an SEC Form S-1 (public or confidential) or the hiring of investment banks, auditors, or CFO-level talent typical of a pre-IPO phase.  
• Large secondary-market share sales, tender offers, or new private funding rounds that could delay or replace an IPO.  
• Market and regulatory conditions for U.S. tech IPOs in 2026, especially for AI companies.  
News or documents on these topics published in the last few weeks or months will be most influential for forecasters between now (2026-02-17) and the cut-off date (2026-02-27).  The queries below target those angles.
