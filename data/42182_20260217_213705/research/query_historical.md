Analysis:
The outside view hinges on two strands of historical context:
1. How the Metaculus community prediction for “Will OpenAI file for an IPO during 2026?” has behaved over time.  Examining previous inflection points (rises above or falls below 41 %) and the cadence of updates will show whether 41 % is a ceiling, a floor, or simply the midpoint of a broader oscillation.  This requires a timeline of past Metaculus snapshots and linking them to news events.
2. Real-world signals about OpenAI’s readiness to go public—e.g., leaks of a draft S-1, hiring of underwriters, secondary share sales, board or corporate-governance changes, revenue disclosures, or comments by Sam Altman, Microsoft, or major investors.  These events are what typically move the community forecast, so compiling their history (especially late-2025 through Feb 2026) provides the substantive backdrop needed to judge whether sentiment is likely to rise over the next 10 days.
