The total fundraising volume could reach \u20bd50\u2013100 billion, according to 'Expert RA' in a report reviewed by RBK. This growth is expected to be driven by a projected reduction in the Central Bank's key interest rate to 13\u201313.5% in 2026, which would signal a favorable environment for companies to prepare for listings. The report highlights that the Russian IPO market has experienced multiple phases over the past five years, including peaks in 2020\u20132021 and 2023\u20132024, a turning point in 2022 following the special military operation and sanctions, and a cooling period in 2025 due to high interest rates. A key structural shift has been the change in investor composition: Russian individual investors now account for 67.8% of stock trading volume (down from a peak of 83% in 2023), while institutional investors, particularly foreign ones, have significantly diminished. This shift has led to reduced market liquidity, smaller deal sizes, and a trend toward small and medium-cap companies. The average IPO size has dropped to 3\u20135 billion rubles, insufficient to replace foreign funds in large deals exceeding 50 billion rubles. Despite the 2025 IPO of 'Dom.RF' raising 31.7 billion rubles, the total volume for that year was only 37 billion rubles. Experts such as Gusein Rzaev from 'BKS Mir Investitsii' remain skeptical, arguing that with the key rate still at 15.5% (well above the neutral 12%), market sentiment remains weak and IPOs are likely to be delayed until the fourth quarter of 2026 or 2027. Other analysts, like Maria Lukina from 'Sina\u0440\u0430', forecast 10\u201315 IPOs in 2026 with a total volume of 100 billion rubles, focusing on IT, AI, fintech, and retail sectors. Potential candidates include 'Sibur', 'Solar' (a subsidiary of 'Rostelecom'), 'Vinlab' stores, and 'VIS' group. The Ministry of Finance has seven state-owned companies under consideration, with two to three expected to go public in 2026. However, most experts do not anticipate a significant influx of institutional capital, as large institutions require deals of at least 2 billion rubles and are uninterested in smaller transactions. The Central Bank has identified 500 potential companies ready for the market, according to First Deputy Governor Vladimir Chistyukhin. The overall market capitalization of the Russian stock market declined from 62.8 trillion rubles (47% of GDP) in 2021 to 50 trillion rubles (23% of GDP) in 2025, despite a recovery in 2023\u20132024. The government aims to raise market capitalization to 66% of GDP by 2030 and 75% by 2036. Risks include persistent inflation, high credit costs, lack of foreign capital, and external shocks such as falling commodity prices.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 09:05 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0411\u041a](https://www.rbc.ru/finances/18/02/2026/6994a0bd9a7947ac3e4f61bf)\n\n**An Under-$1 Pre-IPO AI Investment Still Open to Retail Investors**\nImmersed, a pre-IPO private company operating at the intersection of AI, Spatial Computing, and productivity, is offering investment opportunities to retail investors at $0.66 per share, with a minimum investment of $990. The company, which has over 1.5 million users generating the equivalent of 2,000 years of platform usage, has developed the most popular productivity app on the Meta Quest store and is building a full next-gen computing stack integrating software, hardware, and AI. It has secured partnerships with Meta, Samsung, and Qualcomm, reserved a Nasdaq ticker ($IMRS), and is projecting $71 million in first-year sales. Its upcoming XR headset features 2 million more pixels than Apple\u2019s Vision Pro at 70% less cost and weight. According to Meta, Immersed is the only AR/VR app used 40\u201350 hours per week, with no close competitor. Early investors can receive up to a 20% bonus in pre-IPO shares. The company is positioned to capture a share of the $250 billion+ future of work market. This pre-IPO opportunity is limited and closing soon.

He predicts that at least two major private tech companies\u2014OpenAI, Anthropic, and SpaceX\u2014may go public, potentially raising over $500 billion in market capitalization. Grantham argues that historically, a 1% increase in the market\u2019s total market cap due to IPOs correlates with a 7.5% decline in the S&P 500\u2019s 12-month return. With the U.S. market capitalization at approximately $50 trillion, a 1% rise would require an IPO valued at $500 billion or more\u2014within reach of the cited AI firms. However, recent market sentiment has turned negative toward tech, and Scott Galloway of NYU\u2019s Stern School of Business suggested OpenAI could be 'pulled' from the IPO pipeline. If these megacap IPOs do not materialize, Grantham\u2019s bearish thesis could be defused, potentially leading to a bullish outcome\u2014though Grantham remains pessimistic on long-term U.S. equity prospects for other reasons. The article notes the irony that Grantham\u2019s bearish argument could inadvertently support a bullish market if IPOs fail to happen.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 06:03 PM\nSource:[Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/2026021757/openai-spacex-and-other-ipos-could-break-the-sp-500-jeremy-grantham-says)\n\n**AI Capital Expenditure (Capex) Is Off the Charts: Who Stands to Lose? | The Motley Fool**\nBig tech companies\u2014Amazon, Alphabet, Microsoft, Meta, Apple, and Nvidia\u2014are collectively spending approximately $400 billion on capital expenditures (CapEx) over the last four quarters, primarily driven by AI infrastructure investments. This 'scorched earth' strategy aims to maintain competitive dominance, particularly to counter disruption from AI startups like OpenAI. Analysts Tim Beyers, Jason Hall, and Travis Hoium discuss whether this massive spending is justified. While companies like Alphabet and Microsoft are investing to secure their market position, others like CoreWeave (CRWV) and Oracle (ORCL) are taking on significant debt\u2014CoreWeave has $14 billion in debt with over $300 million in annual interest and a projected 220% of revenue in 2026 CapEx\u2014raising concerns about sustainability. CoreWeave's high-risk model relies on future contracts and external funding, with no guarantee of success. Oracle, despite a $523 billion backlog and strong free cash flow, is also leveraged and betting heavily on AI infrastructure, though its enterprise stability offers a higher floor than CoreWeave. Analysts warn that if demand slows or funding dries up, companies like CoreWeave could face collapse, while Oracle\u2019s more diversified business offers greater resilience. The broader market risks include overbuilding, declining returns on underutilized assets, and a potential bubble fueled by excessive debt and overconfidence. The consensus is that while the current AI race is necessary, the long-term economic model remains uncertain, and not all players will survive.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 01:42 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/02/17/ai-capital-expenditure-capex-is-off-the-charts-who/)\n\n**Global IPOs Surge 42% in 2025, Driven by U.S. 'Winning Horse' Stocks**\nGlobal initial public offerings (IPOs) are experiencing a strong recovery, with funds raised in 2025 reaching $186.5 billion (approximately \u00a52.957 trillion), a 42% increase compared to the same period in the previous year.

The IPO is priced in a band of \u20b975 to \u20b980 per share, with a lot size of 1,600 shares; at the upper end, a retail investor must invest \u20b92,56,000 to bid for two lots (3,200 shares). The company aims to raise \u20b920.10 crore through a fresh issue of 2.5 million shares. According to the red herring prospectus (RHP), 50% of the issue is reserved for Qualified Institutional Buyers (QIBs), at least 15% for Non-Institutional Investors, and at least 35% for retail investors. Unofficial market data shows Mobilise App's unlisted shares trading at \u20b991, reflecting a 14% premium over the upper price band. The basis of allotment is expected to be finalized on Thursday, February 26, 2026, with shares credited to demat accounts on Friday, February 27, 2026. The company's shares are tentatively scheduled to list on the NSE SME platform on Monday, March 2, 2026. Bigshare Services is the registrar, and Corporate Capital Ventures is the sole book-running lead manager. Proceeds from the IPO will be used for product development (\u20b95.54 crore), business development and marketing (\u20b93.03 crore), infrastructure (\u20b95.47 crore), and general corporate purposes. Financially, in the nine-month period ended December 31, 2026 (H1FY26), Mobilise App reported \u20b913.23 crore in revenue and \u20b94.01 crore in profit after tax (PAT).

Kai Jordan, a board member of mwb fairtrade Wertpapierhandelsbank, notes that the bank itself increasingly uses AI and algorithms in market making. Major tech firms\u2014Microsoft, Amazon, Meta, and Alphabet\u2014are projected to invest over $600 billion in AI by 2026. OpenAI is forecasted to lose approximately $14 billion by 2026 and $115 billion by 2029, with estimates suggesting it spends about $3 for every $1 earned. Nvidia reduced its planned AI investment from $100 billion to $20 billion. Societal risks include AI-driven manipulation via deepfakes, recommendation algorithms, and dynamic pricing; reinforcement of bias and discrimination; non-consensual pornographic content; and cases where chatbots exacerbated suicidal behavior. Around 100,000 users protested the deprecation of ChatGPT-40 due to emotional support. A PwC survey (January 2026) of 4,454 CEOs found that 50% saw no measurable financial benefit from AI, only 30% reported revenue growth, and 56% observed no significant cost savings; Gartner reported that only 20% of service sector companies reduced staff, while 50% plan to rehire by 2027. A YouTube channel 'Cold-Fusion' tested AI and found it outperformed humans in only 3.75% of cases. AI offers time savings but lacks broad replacement value beyond image and video editing. Systemic financial risks include the 'AI Money Loop'\u2014circular capital flows among investors, developers, infrastructure providers, and hardware suppliers\u2014combined with market stress (eroding Nasdaq 100 prices), high corporate debt (e.g., Oracle at ~$130 billion, with up to $50 billion in planned capital raises), IPO pressures (OpenAI, xAI/SpaceX), and environmentally problematic plans like orbital data centers.

While AI has transformative impacts on daily life\u2014such as influencing political discourse via deepfakes, enabling dynamic pricing, and reinforcing algorithmic biases\u2014concerns persist over ethical risks, including identity fraud, non-consensual pornography, and the potential for AI to exacerbate suicidal thoughts. A petition by around 100,000 ChatGPT 4.0 users urged OpenAI not to replace the version due to its emotional support value. Despite AI's growing use in investment decisions by both institutional and retail investors, the report warns of 'garbage in, garbage out' risks. A 2026 PwC survey found that half of 4,454 CEOs reported no measurable financial benefit from AI, with only 30% seeing revenue growth and 56% reporting no cost savings. Gartner data showed only 20% of service-sector companies reduced staff via AI, yet 50% plan to rehire by 2027. A study by the 'Cold-Fusion' YouTube channel found AI performed worse than humans in 96.25% of real-world tasks, though it excelled in image and video editing. On financial markets, AI-driven stocks have caused turbulence: companies with vulnerable business models face risks, while investor skepticism grows over the sustainability of massive AI investments. OpenAI is projected to lose $14 billion in 2026 and burn $115 billion by 2029, driven by enormous compute costs\u2014OpenAI reportedly spends $3 for every $1 earned. Nvidia\u2019s planned $100 billion investment in OpenAI was reduced to $20 billion due to concerns over OpenAI\u2019s business model and 'circular financing.' This cycle involves investors funding AI developers, who rent cloud infrastructure, which in turn pays hardware providers like Nvidia, creating a closed-loop economy. Oracle faces $130 billion in total debt, with plans to raise up to $50 billion in new capital. A race between OpenAI and Elon Musk\u2019s xAI for the first AI IPO is underway, with Musk planning to merge xAI with SpaceX for a potential $1.25 trillion valuation. SpaceX aims to launch orbital AI data centers to avoid Earth\u2019s water and energy constraints, using radiative cooling in space. However, critics accuse Musk of bypassing environmental approvals. The mwb advises caution, advocating for a 'cool head' and critical scrutiny of AI's real-world performance and sustainability.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 08:10 AM\nSource:[Aktien Check](https://www.aktiencheck.de/news/Artikel-EQS_News_Intelligenzia_loading_deutsch-19478047)\n\n**Artificial Intelligence: A Giant Bet on the Future**\nThe five largest U.S. tech companies\u2014Microsoft, Meta, Amazon, Alphabet, and Oracle\u2014are projected to invest $700 billion in artificial intelligence (AI) this year, driven by the fear of falling behind in a high-stakes race. Despite this massive spending, no reliable business model exists to confirm that these investments will generate returns. OpenAI, which launched the AI boom with ChatGPT just under four years ago, has yet to turn a profit and is expected to accumulate \u20ac100 billion in losses by 2030. The $700 billion represents 2.2% of U.S. economic output\u2014exceeding the historical costs of the Apollo Moon program and the construction of U.S. highways, though still below 19th-century rail investments. AI investments are not primarily in software or talent but in physical infrastructure: data centers, power plants, and electrical grids, as high-performance AI systems consume vast amounts of energy. This infrastructure boom is causing labor shortages, particularly among skilled electricians and mechanics, with OpenAI warning that 20% of U.S. tradespeople may be needed for its data center projects, urging an urgent training expansion. Meanwhile, non-AI-focused startups and companies report growing difficulty securing investment. Tech giants have so far financed their AI spending through profits from legacy businesses and private capital, but this phase is ending: Oracle now holds the highest debt among U.S. tech firms, and companies are issuing long-term bonds\u2014Alphabet recently issued a 50-year bond and is planning a 100-year 'Methusalem Bond' to attract institutional investors. These bonds, aimed at insurers and funds, signal increasing reliance on private capital, which assumes substantial risk. Market reactions have already been volatile: Alphabet\u2019s stock dropped double digits after its AI announcements, and Oracle\u2019s market value has halved since its 2023 peak. Experts warn a potential crash could erase up to $35 trillion in market value. Despite these risks, executives like Meta\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg still consider a dot-com-style crash 'definitely possible' but remain committed to the AI race.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 05:00 AM\nSource:[stuttgarter-nachrichten.de](https://www.stuttgarter-nachrichten.de/inhalt.kuenstliche-intelligenz-eine-gigantische-wette.934571f3-e81d-4872-bd6b-7c1a0670acf7.html)\n\n**Big Tech's AI Spending Surge Raises EU Data Sovereignty Concerns**\nBig Tech companies are investing over $700 billion (\u20ac590 billion) in capital expenditures (CapEx) for artificial intelligence (AI) infrastructure in 2026, representing a 75% increase compared to 2025. This spending surpasses the nominal GDP of Sweden for 2025, according to IMF projections. The Semiconductor Industry Association forecasts global chip sales to reach $1 trillion (\u20ac842 billion) for the first time in 2026. Analysts predict AI-related CapEx will exceed $5 trillion (\u20ac4.2 trillion) by 2030, driven by 'astronomical' demand for computing power. Amazon leads with a $200 billion (\u20ac170 billion) CapEx forecast for 2026\u2014exceeding the combined GDP of the Baltic states in 2025\u2014followed by Alphabet ($185B/\u20ac155B), Microsoft ($145B/\u20ac122B), Meta ($135B/\u20ac113B), Oracle ($50B/\u20ac42.1B), Tesla ($20B/\u20ac16.8B), and xAI ($30B/\u20ac25.2B). xAI, acquired by SpaceX in a stock-only deal, now has a combined valuation of $1.25 trillion (\u20ac1.05 trillion), making it the most valuable private company in history. SpaceX may go public in 2026, with Morgan Stanley involved in the process. Apple is lagging with only $13B (\u20ac10.9B) in CapEx, opting instead for a multi-year partnership with Google to integrate Gemini AI into Apple Intelligence, particularly to revamp Siri and enhance on-device AI. Nvidia, the dominant chip supplier for AI data centers, is expected to benefit most from this spending. However, concerns are growing about the sustainability of this investment spree: Morgan Stanley projects $400B (\u20ac337B) in corporate debt issuance for 2026\u2014more than double 2025 levels\u2014potentially pushing total U.S. investment-grade corporate bond issuance to a record $2.25T (\u20ac1.9T). Analysts like Alex Haissl (Rothschild & Co) and Michael Burry warn that current spending reflects irrational exuberance and may lead to a bubble, citing risks of rapid hardware obsolescence and high operational costs. Meanwhile, the EU faces a stark competitiveness gap: projected European sovereign cloud infrastructure spending is only \u20ac10.6 billion in 2026\u2014up 83% year-on-year but still dwarfed by U.S. investments. The EU\u2019s AI Factories and AI Continent Action Plan aim to mobilize public-private investment, but critics argue regulation alone cannot achieve technological supremacy. Mistral AI, a leading European AI startup, is countering this trend with a \u20ac1.2 billion investment in a sovereign-compliant data center in Borl\u00e4nge, Sweden, set to open in 2027, in partnership with EcoDataCenter. The facility will leverage Sweden\u2019s green energy and meet strict EU data sovereignty standards. U.S. tech firms are offering 'sovereign-light' solutions like localized cloud zones in Germany and Portugal, but critics argue these remain technically dependent on American parent companies, leaving Europe vulnerable to U.S. economic and political shifts. As 2026 progresses, the U.S. is betting heavily on AI leadership, even at the cost of its creditworthiness, while Europe seeks to carve out a sovereign niche through targeted investment and regulation.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:00 AM\nSource:[euronews](https://it.euronews.com/business/2026/02/16/analisi-i-colossali-investimenti-ia-di-big-tech-metteranno-fine-alla-sovranita-dei-dati-ue)\n\n**Could OpenAI\u2019s $1 Trillion IPO Be a Lifesaver for Nvidia, Microsoft, and Amazon?**\nOpenAI and Anthropic are accelerating their timelines toward a potential IPO in 2026, which could prevent a short-term slowdown in AI infrastructure spending and potentially benefit Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon.com (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT). According to prediction market data, OpenAI's IPO is expected to occur by December 31, 2026, with a 40% probability, while a June 30, 2026, debut has only a 6% chance. In the 'best model' competition, Google (NASDAQ:GOOGL) leads with an 81% chance of holding the top rank on the Chatbot Arena leaderboard by March 31, while OpenAI trails at 8%. Market sentiment is skeptical about Anthropic\u2019s IPO, with an 89% probability that it will not go public by June 30, 2026. The IPO pressure may drive increased investment in computing power, accelerating AI infrastructure growth. This includes strong demand for semiconductors (AMD, AVGO, TSMC), cloud services (Amazon\u2019s reported $50 billion investment talks with OpenAI suggesting a strategic shift beyond Microsoft), and data center infrastructure (Arista Networks, Vertiv Holdings, Super Micro Computer). A significant shift in the 'best model' odds or confirmation of Amazon\u2019s multi-billion-dollar investment could signal a major transformation in the competitive landscape.\nOriginal language: ja\nPublish date: January 31, 2026 06:45 AM\nSource:[Benzinga Japan](https://www.benzinga.com/content/50285561/1-ai-ipo)\n\n**10 Tech/VC Trends to Watch out for in 2026**\nThe article outlines ten key technology and venture capital trends expected to shape the landscape in 2026. First, the AI-enabled roll-up strategy\u2014pioneered by General Catalyst and supported by firms like Thrive Capital, Elad Gil, and Khosla\u2014gains momentum, with predictions that two or more portfolio companies will reach $5B+ valuations and $100M+ ARR, aiming for IPOs. Second, horizontal AI-native platforms like Attio, Rillet, and Serval are poised for disruption in ERP, CRM, and ITSM, with Serval raising $75M at a $1B valuation; a prediction suggests an AI-native ERP company will go public. Third, stablecoins are accelerating in cross-border payments, with Circle\u2019s IPO and Stripe\u2019s Tempo protocol fueling growth; stablecoin volume is projected to exceed $20B in 2026, with at least three new unicorns emerging. Fourth, the 'Supernova' growth narrative\u2014rapid ARR scaling\u2014is under scrutiny, with concerns about sustainability; however, slower-growing 'Shooting Stars' with healthier margins may outperform. Fifth, AI-driven financial operations automation is advancing, with Ramp\u2019s $32B valuation and $1B ARR signaling a shift; a new AI-native finance unicorn is expected. Sixth, the longevity sector continues to expand, with Oura raising $900M at $11B and Neko Health securing $260M; predictions include Bryan Johnson raising $200M and a longevity clinic launching a $250/year subscription. Seventh, prediction markets (Kalshi, Polymarket) surge post-2024 elections, with $1B+ weekly volume; Robinhood and Coinbase enter the space, but regulatory scrutiny looms. Eighth, the enterprise foundation model battle intensifies, with Anthropic growing from 12% to 40% enterprise market share, while OpenAI\u2019s share drops to 27%; Anthropic is predicted to reach 50% by 2026. Ninth, defense tech funding hits $7.7B in 2025, with Anduril raising $2.5B at $30B and Helsing securing \u20ac600M; a prediction anticipates global defense tech funding surpassing $10B and Anduril doubling to $60B. Tenth, IPOs remain active with Anthropic and SpaceX planning public listings at $300B and $1.5T, respectively, while Databricks raises a $134B valuation; however, OpenAI, Stripe, Revolut, and Databricks are expected to remain private, with Revolut conducting another secondary round over $100B.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 24, 2025 06:47 PM\nSource:[Medium.com](https://medium.com/@vcnewsfr/10-tech-vc-trends-to-watch-out-for-in-2026-0664d3b80572)\n\n**Amazon, Meta, SpaceX, OpenAI And Trillion-Dollar IPOs Lead Futurum CEO Daniel Newman's Top 2026 Tech Predictions**\nDaniel Newman, CEO of Futurum Research, and strategist Shay Boloor shared their top seven stock market predictions for 2026, highlighting long-term equity trends driven by AI infrastructure, software platforms, rising energy demand, and shifting capital allocation. Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Meta (NASDAQ:META) are poised for strong performance in 2026 after recent concerns about AWS\u2019s AI investment and Meta\u2019s talent spending eased, with both companies showing improved strategies. SpaceX is expected to lead the 2026 IPO market with a valuation exceeding $1 trillion, surpassing OpenAI, while Anthropic, Canva, and Databricks are also predicted to deliver blockbuster IPOs. Hyperscalers like Google (NASDAQ:GOOG, NASDAQ:GOOGL) are expanding datacenter capacity through partnerships and major acquisitions, such as the $4.5 billion Intersect Power deal, with future growth relying on power availability and M&A. Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) is expected to undergo a leadership transition as Tim Cook nears the end of his tenure, likely leading to renewed AI focus, increased capital expenditures, and significant infrastructure investment. Enterprise AI is set to drive growth beyond LLM hype, with companies like Palantir (NASDAQ:PLTR), ServiceNow (NYSE:NOW), Salesforce (NYSE:CRM), and IBM (NYSE:IBM) adopting AI agents and workflows to generate high token volumes. Despite OpenAI\u2019s high-profile IPO, its competitive edge in LLMs is waning, with full-stack AI players like Google (Gemini 3) and emerging coding AI leaders Grok and Anthropic gaining traction. Nvidia (NASDAQ:NVDA) is projected to exceed $300 billion in revenue in 2026, driven by data centers, and may surpass Google as the world\u2019s most profitable company, with Newman stating, 'Nvidia remains the king.' These predictions align with broader market outlooks, though midterm volatility could impact tech stocks, according to analysts like Kenny Polcari.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 24, 2025 12:35 PM\nSource:[Benzinga News](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/tech/25/12/49580839/amazon-meta-spacex-openai-and-trillion-dollar-ipos-lead-futurum-ceo-daniel-newmans-top-2026-tech-predictions)\n\n**Market Warns of AI Bubble Risk from Upcoming IPOs Amid Confidence in Core Tech Leaders**\nAnalysts are increasingly concerned about a potential AI sector bubble, particularly as major unlisted companies like OpenAI, Anthropic, and SpaceX are expected to go public by late 2026. These upcoming IPOs raise concerns over inflated valuations\u2014OpenAI\u2019s valuation has surged from $300 billion to $1 trillion, despite estimated 2024 revenues of $20 billion, which analysts argue is insufficient to justify such figures. Anthropic, with \u20ac380 million in 2024 revenues, is projected to reach $9 billion in 2025 and potentially $20\u201326 billion in 2026, yet its latest funding round is based on a $300 billion valuation, sparking skepticism. Experts from Bankinter warn that the 'frivolization' of financial figures undermines credibility, even under optimistic growth assumptions. There is fear that overvalued IPOs could trigger a 'sell-off' in already-listed AI leaders like Nvidia, Apple, Amazon, and Meta\u2014referred to as the 'Seven Magnificent'\u2014due to a domino effect. However, analysts emphasize that the broader AI ecosystem remains fundamentally sound: listed companies show record profits, strong net cash positions (zero debt), and robust free cash flow\u2014Nvidia\u2019s exceeds $97 billion, Apple\u2019s $130.8 billion. Deutsche Bank highlights that current investment is largely funded internally, not through debt, and is driven by real technological progress, distinguishing this cycle from the dot-com bubble. The consensus is that the AI sector is experiencing a structural boom, not a classic speculative bubble.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 19, 2025 12:52 PM\nSource:[El Correo](https://www.elcorreo.com/economia/empresas/mercado-centra-riesgo-burbuja-ia-proximas-salidas-20251219135031-ntrc.html)\n\n**OpenAI Preps for Wall Street Debut with $1 Trillion IPO Expectations**\nOpenAI, having transitioned from a nonprofit to a for-profit company, is preparing for a public offering on Wall Street that could reach $1 trillion, making it the largest IPO in history. This move is driven by the explosive growth of generative AI and the success of ChatGPT. Sam Altman's plans aim for a stock market debut by 2027, though it could occur as early as the second half of 2026. Current negotiations are still in early stages, and timelines and figures may change based on company growth and market conditions. In broader Wall Street news, the week was marked by earnings reports from the Big Seven tech firms, excluding Nvidia, which will report on November 21. Meta reported revenue of $51.24 billion\u2014well above expectations\u2014but net income per share was $1.05, far below the projected $6.70, due to a $16 billion extraordinary charge tied to the 'Big Beautiful Bill,' a Trump-backed budget law. The stock dropped nearly 8% before the market opened. Alphabet, Google's parent company, posted $102.3 billion in revenue, a 16% year-over-year increase, surpassing forecasts, with Google Cloud revenue reaching $15.16 billion, exceeding even the most optimistic estimates. Microsoft also delivered a strong quarter, with $77.67 billion in revenue (+18% YoY) and net income rising to $27.7 billion, driven by growth in its Azure cloud division.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 04:00 AM\nSource:[il Giornale.it](https://www.ilgiornale.it/news/economia/openai-si-prepara-wall-street-atteso-debutto-1000-miliardi-2560711.html)\n\n**OpenAI Eyes Massive $1T IPO as Early as 2026: Reuters**\nOpenAI is reportedly targeting an initial public offering (IPO) as early as the second half of 2026, with a potential valuation of up to $1 trillion, according to Reuters, citing three sources familiar with the matter. While OpenAI's chief financial officer, Sarah Friar, has indicated a possible 2027 IPO, some advisers believe it could occur sooner. The move aims to reduce OpenAI's reliance on Microsoft, which holds a 27% stake following a recent recapitalization. OpenAI's flagship product, ChatGPT, played a key role in mainstreaming AI tools, prompting major tech firms like Google, Microsoft, Meta, and X (formerly Twitter) to launch their own AI assistants. As a result, AI has become a bellwether for the broader technology sector, often correlating with the cryptocurrency market due to their shared status as risk-on investments. Despite its rapid growth, OpenAI reportedly incurred a loss of $11.5 billion in the last quarter, according to The Register, citing Microsoft\u2019s quarterly earnings. OpenAI did not respond to a request for comment from CoinDesk. In a recent DevDay event, CEO Sam Altman acknowledged that 'there are many parts of AI that... are kind of bubbly right now,' while attempting to differentiate OpenAI from its competitors, as reported by the BBC.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 06:04 PM\nSource:[CoinDesk](https://www.coindesk.com/business/2025/10/30/openai-eyes-massive-usd1t-ipo-as-early-as-2026-reuters)\n\n**What a $1 Trillion OpenAI IPO Would Mean for Microsoft, Investors, and the AI Market**\nOpenAI is reportedly preparing for a potential IPO in 2027, with a valuation of up to $1 trillion, according to Reuters. The company plans to file with securities regulators in the second half of 2026 and aims to raise at least $60 billion, making it one of the largest tech IPOs in history. This follows OpenAI\u2019s restructuring into a nonprofit public benefit corporation (PBC) and a new agreement with Microsoft, its largest investor. Microsoft currently holds a 27% stake in OpenAI Group PBC, valued at approximately $135 billion, down from 32.5% prior to recent funding rounds. Since 2019, Microsoft has invested over $13 billion in OpenAI and integrated its GPT technology across products including Office 365, Windows, and Azure. At a $1 trillion valuation, Microsoft\u2019s stake would be worth $270 billion\u2014nearly double its current book value\u2014making it one of the most lucrative corporate venture bets ever. However, risks are emerging: OpenAI plans to reduce Microsoft\u2019s revenue share from 20% to 8%\u201320% by 2030, potentially saving $50 billion in retained earnings. Once public, OpenAI could face pressure to renegotiate long-term contracts or pursue new partnerships with rivals like Google or Amazon, threatening Microsoft\u2019s exclusivity. An IPO would place OpenAI among the world\u2019s ten most valuable companies, rivaling Nvidia, Apple, Alphabet, Amazon, and Meta. With current private market valuations around $500 billion, a public listing could double that value, triggering a wave of follow-on IPOs from competitors such as Anthropic (valued at $183 billion), xAI, and Cohere. OpenAI\u2019s debut would set a benchmark for how public markets value generative AI firms and shape the trajectory of the ongoing AI boom.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 30, 2025 10:40 AM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/de/news/2025/10/30/was-wurde-ein-openai-borsengang-in-hohe-von-1-billion-us-dollar-fur-microsoft-investoren-und-den-ki-markt-bedeuten/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
