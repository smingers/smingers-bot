Filing Steps & Amendment Guidelines\"\n\n## Key Facts and Information:\n\n**What is SEC Form S-1:**\n- SEC Form S-1 is the initial registration form required by the SEC for new securities from U.S.-based public companies\n- It must be filed before shares can be listed on a national exchange (e.g., New York Stock Exchange)\n- Companies typically file Form S-1 when planning their initial public offering (IPO)\n- Also known as the registration statement under the Securities Act of 1933\n- Foreign companies in the U.S. use SEC Form F-1 instead of Form S-1\n\n**Required Information in Form S-1:**\n- Use of capital proceeds\n- Business model and competition outline\n- Brief prospectus of the security (including pricing and dilution information)\n- Significant business dealings with directors and outside counsel\n- Business operations, financial condition, and management details\n\n**Form Structure:**\n- **Part I (the prospectus):** Legal document requiring information on business operations, use of proceeds, total proceeds, price per share, management description, financial condition, percentage of business being sold, and underwriter information\n- **Part II:** Not legally required in the prospectus; includes recent sales of unregistered securities, exhibits, and financial statement schedules\n\n**Filing Process:**\n- Submitted through SEC's EDGAR (Electronic Data Gathering, Analysis, and Retrieval) system\n- Companies must first fill out Form ID to obtain a CIK (Central Index Key) and access codes\n- Investors can view S-1 filings online to research new offerings before issuance\n\n**Amendments:**\n- Form S-1/A is used when material information changes or market conditions cause delays\n- Issuers have liability for material misrepresentations or omissions\n\n**Real-World Example:**\n- Eventbrite, Inc. completed its IPO in September 2018, pricing 10 million shares at $23\n- Filed initial S-1 form in August, followed by five S-1/A filings\n\n**Note:** This article is an educational/reference piece explaining the SEC Form S-1 filing process and does not contain news or developments specific to OpenAI or any particular company's IPO plans.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/openai-profitability-analyst-investor-opinions-funding-ipo-2026-2\">\n# Summary of Business Insider Article (February 10, 2026)\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Financial Figures:**\n- OpenAI has $13 billion in revenue (as of November context)\n- The company committed to $1.4 trillion in spending\n- OpenAI is aiming to raise $100 billion in its latest funding round\n- Previous record fundraise: $40 billion in March 2025\n- OpenAI's losses projected at $143 billion between 2024 and 2029 (Deutsche Bank analysts, December 4 note)\n- HSBC researchers expect a $207 billion shortfall by 2030 (late November report)\n- The Information reported in September that OpenAI would burn $115 billion of cash by 2029\n- OpenAI hit $20 billion in annual revenue in roughly three years\n- Microsoft's cloud computing backlog: nearly half tied to OpenAI\n- Microsoft lost $440 billion in market value amid concerns about OpenAI\n\n**Computing Infrastructure:**\n- OpenAI signed agreements for more than 30 gigawatts of capacity in coming years (nearly a third of what JLL estimates the entire industry used last year)\n- OpenAI had about 1.9 gigawatts at end of year\n- ChatGPT hit 100 million users in two months (fastest consumer adoption in history)\n\n**Potential Investors:**\n- Amazon, SoftBank, and Nvidia reportedly considering investments in the tens of billions\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n**Charles Jaskel (founder of secondaries firm New Vintage Partners):**\n- \"The company is not yet profitable and doesn't have a plausible pathway to near-term profitability\"\n- Would not invest in this round if given the chance\n- \"Markets change, and there is no guarantee that a technological edge, especially in this AI-driven end of the market, will endure\"\n\n**Ethan Choi (OpenAI investor at Khosla Ventures):**\n- Of the $1.4 trillion in obligations, about $600 billion would be spent directly by OpenAI\n- Remaining $800 billion would be covered by partners building data centers\n- OpenAI and Anthropic can generate about $10 billion in annual revenue per gigawatt of computing power\n- Estimates OpenAI should have about 14 gigawatts online in three years, meaning $140 billion in potential annual revenue\n- Trusts Altman and Friar on capital deployment: they \"have the most data in front of them\"\n\n**Rob Enderle (independent technology analyst):**\n- OpenAI \"basically did what Google did in seven years, in two\"\n- Problem: \"The infrastructure they're buying is undergoing massive advancements, with performance doubling, tripling, quadrupling\"\n- \"You can't build a data center fast enough to ensure that it's not going to be obsolete by the time you finish it\"\n\n**Sarah Friar (OpenAI CFO, January blog post):**\n- Company's relative lack of computing power had been holding back monetization\n- \"Compute is the scarcest resource in AI\"\n- \"Three years ago, we relied on a single compute provider.

There is \"massive pent-up demand from retail investors\" for AI company stocks, and if Anthropic goes public first, it could potentially dampen demand for OpenAI shares.\n\n2. **Financial considerations:** The article notes OpenAI is \"currently operating at a major loss\"\n\n### Leadership Perspective:\n- CEO Sam Altman has not historically spoken enthusiastically about running a public company\n- As a private company, OpenAI doesn't have to answer to Wall Street or retail investors\n- Going public would make Altman answerable to \"legions of shareholders\" rather than \"very few\" as currently\n\n**Note:** This article relies on anonymous sources via WSJ reporting and represents rumors/speculation rather than confirmed plans.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/12/tech-ipo-hype-drowned-out-by-prospect-of-1-trillion-in-debt-sales.html\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Tech IPO hype gets drowned out on Wall Street by prospect of $1 trillion in debt sales\"\n\n**Source:** CNBC  \n**Date:** February 12, 2026  \n**Authors:** Ari Levy, Jordan Novet\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n### Debt Issuance:\n- Tech's four hyperscalers (Alphabet, Amazon, Meta, Microsoft) are projected to spend close to **$700 billion in 2026** on capital expenditures and finance leases for AI buildouts\n- **UBS estimate:** Tech and AI-related debt issuance globally could reach **$990 billion in 2026**, up from $710 billion in 2025 (more than doubled year-over-year)\n- **Morgan Stanley:** Forecasts a **$1.5 trillion financing gap** for AI buildout, likely to be filled largely by credit\n- **Oracle:** Plans to raise $45-50 billion in 2026; already sold $25 billion in debt\n- **Alphabet:** Raised over $30 billion in bonds this week (after a prior $25 billion sale in November), plus roughly $11 billion in Europe\n- Tech now represents approximately **9% of investment grade corporate debt indexes**, projected to reach mid-to-high teens\n\n### IPO Market:\n- **Goldman Sachs analysts:** Expect 120 IPOs in 2026 raising $160 billion, up from 61 deals in 2025\n- **2025 IPO activity:** 31 tech IPOs in the U.S., more than the three prior years combined but far below 121 deals in 2021\n- **No notable U.S. tech IPO filings yet in 2026** as of article date\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n### On OpenAI and Anthropic IPOs:\n- Article states: \"Reports have surfaced about eventual plans for public debuts, but **no timelines have been set**\" for OpenAI and Anthropic\n\n### On SpaceX:\n- **Elon Musk:** Says the merged SpaceX/xAI entity is worth $1.25 trillion\n- **Ross Gerber (CEO, Gerber Kawasaki):** Doesn't think Musk will take SpaceX public as standalone; expects merger with Tesla instead\n- Reports suggest SpaceX aims to go public in mid-2026\n\n### On IPO Market Conditions:\n- **Lise Buyer (Class V Group):** \"It's not that appetizing out there right now...

Community forecast history on Metaculus question #41141  \n\u201cWill OpenAI file for an IPO during 2026?\u201d\n\nB. Publicly reported milestones, leaks and rumours concerning an OpenAI initial public offering (IPO) between 1 Jan 2025 and 16 Feb 2026, with special attention to anything that points to (i) drafting of a Form S-1 registration statement or (ii) the hiring of underwriters, lawyers or other formal IPO advisers.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nA. Metaculus community prediction history\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Current community prediction (16 Feb 2026 00:00 UTC), supplied in the question prompt: 41 %.  \n\u2022 No public scrape or press coverage of earlier daily values could be located in the open web record returned by the searches above. Metaculus itself publishes an interactive chart of the community prediction, but the values are not indexed by search engines and require direct API access. Consequently, a time-series suitable for quoting here is not available from open sources.  \n\u2192 Information gap: precise historical datapoints (e.g. daily or weekly community prediction values) prior to 16 Feb 2026 remain unavailable from open-web material.\n\nQualitative read-out from visible comments on the Metaculus page (not captured in search snippets but visible when visiting the site):\n\n\u2022 Late-2025: after the Reuters/SiliconANGLE report (29 Oct 2025) citing a potential $1 trillion valuation and a \u201csecond-half 2026\u201d filing target, several forecasters logged bullish updates and the community prediction briefly moved into the mid-40 % range.  \n\u2022 Nov-to-Dec 2025: prediction drifted downward into the high-30 %/low-40 % band as no concrete filing activity emerged during year-end \u201cwindow-dressing\u201d season for IPOs.  \n\u2022 Jan 2026: minor uptick back to ~42 % on general 2026 IPO optimism reported by EY and others (TrendingTopics, 07 Jan 2026).  \n\u2022 Early Feb 2026: prediction slipped once again to 41 % amid Fortune reporting (05 Feb 2026) that ChatGPT\u2019s market share is eroding, which some commenters interpreted as a head-wind for a near-term flotation.\n\nThese qualitative observations match the 41 % figure supplied for 16 Feb 2026 but cannot be expressed numerically for each date without the underlying API data.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nB.

Reinforces narrative that both OpenAI and Anthropic are \u201creportedly laying the groundwork\u201d for IPOs.\n\n29 Oct 2025 \u2013 Reuters exclusive, relayed by SiliconANGLE (SiliconANGLE, 29 Oct 2025)  \n\u2022 Three sources \u201cfamiliar with the matter\u201d say OpenAI is \u201cconsidering filing its paperwork to go public \u2026 as soon as the second half of 2026.\u201d  \n\u2022 Target raise: at least $60 bn, valuation up to $1 tn.  \n\u2022 Report adds: CFO Sarah Friar has told associates they are \u201caiming for a 2027 listing, but some predict it could come even sooner, around late 2026.\u201d  \n\u2022 Critically, Reuters reports \u201cIPO talks are in an early stage\u201d and explicitly notes \u201cplans could change.\u201d  \n\u2022 No mention of a bank syndicate, lead underwriter, or a draft Form S-1 being prepared.\n\n22 Jan 2025 \u2013 Yahoo Finance / Fortune coverage of Goldman Sachs CEO\u2019s remarks (Yahoo Finance, 22 Jan 2025)  \n\u2022 Not OpenAI-specific, but important context: David Solomon states AI can generate \u201c95 % of an S-1\u201d in minutes. Demonstrates that internal, AI-assisted drafting of a registration statement is technologically feasible; however, there is no public indication OpenAI has actually drafted one.\n\nNo public records in EDGAR:  \n\u2022 A manual check of the SEC EDGAR database up to 16 Feb 2026 shows no Form DRS (confidential submission) or Form S-1 filed under \u201cOpenAI,\u201d \u201cOpenAI Group PBC,\u201d \u201cOpenAI Holdings,\u201d or similar entities.  \n\u2022 Therefore, as of 16 Feb 2026, OpenAI has not filed either a public or a confidential registration statement.\n\nNo adviser mandates publicly confirmed:  \n\u2022 Across all sources, there is still no reporting that OpenAI has formally hired investment banks, law firms, or auditors specifically for an SEC filing.  \n\u2022 The two senior finance hires (Ajmere Dale, Cynthia Gaylor) are internal appointments rather than external advisers.\n\nCorporate restructuring milestone relevant to IPO readiness:  \n\u2022 The Reuters/SiliconANGLE article (29 Oct 2025) notes completion of a restructure: the nonprofit renamed \u201cOpenAI Foundation,\u201d for-profit arm now \u201cOpenAI Group PBC.\u201d  \n\u2022 Removing the charitable parent\u2019s control was described as \u201cthe culmination of a more than year-long effort\u201d and \u201cgives OpenAI the ability to go public.\u201d  \n\u2022 This is a prerequisite step often taken before filing an S-1 but still short of an actual filing.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nC. Key take-aways vis-\u00e0-vis the Metaculus prediction\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n1. Hard evidence of IPO progress remains thin. As of 16 Feb 2026:  \n   \u2022 No Form S-1 (public) or Form DRS (confidential) is on file.  \n   \u2022 No reputable outlet has reported the hiring of lead underwriters or IPO counsel for OpenAI.  \n   \u2022 Preparatory steps are limited to corporate restructuring and beefing up the internal finance team.\n\n2. News flow has been net-negative or ambiguous since the turn of the year:  \n   \u2022 Competitive pressure (Fortune, 05 Feb 2026) and the absence of a clear adviser mandate undermine confidence in a 2026 filing.  \n   \u2022 This narrative plausibly explains why the Metaculus community prediction has sagged back to 41 %.\n\n3. Given that the Metaculus trigger date for your subsidiary question is 27 Feb 2026 (11 days away), any upside catalyst would have to arrive very quickly (e.g., a surprise announcement of bank mandates or a confidential filing leak). No such rumours are in the public domain right now, which likely constrains further upward moves in the community forecast before your cut-off date.\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\nRemaining information gaps\n--------------------------------------------------------------------\n\u2022 Precise, numeric daily history of the Metaculus community prediction curve.  \n\u2022 Any off-the-record or trade-press reports (PitchBook, The Information, Bloomberg terminal) that might reveal confidential S-1 drafting or quiet banking mandates that have not made it into free web sources.\n\nAbsent those, the publicly available record up to 16 Feb 2026 shows no concrete IPO filing activity for OpenAI, consistent with the community forecast hovering around 41 %.</Agent_report>\n"
