Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Summary Articles (AInvest, MarketBeat, IndexBox, Barchart):**
All dated Feb 11-17, 2026. High quality factual data on Q4 2025 earnings (EPS $5.21 beat, revenue $2.06B miss), 2026 guidance ($21.30-21.55 EPS), and recent stock decline (44% over 52 weeks, new 52-week low at $314.56 on Feb 17). Multiple named analyst sources (Goldman Sachs, Citigroup, JP Morgan, Oppenheimer) with specific downgrades and target cuts. Consensus rating "Hold" with average target $478.53. Strong factual foundation with clearly attributed expert opinions.

**Jim Cramer Article (Finviz):**
Dated Feb 2026. Named expert opinion from Jim Cramer stating ROP "doesn't bounce back until the enterprise software cohort finally gets out of the doghouse, and I don't see that happening any time soon." Identifies sector-wide headwinds affecting ServiceNow, Adobe, Salesforce. Opinion clearly attributed but represents single viewpoint.

**Simply Wall St/Yahoo Finance Article:**
Dated Feb 13, 2026. Factual data: ROP down 8.9% in one week, down 44% over year, EPS down 1.1%. Notes "significant insider buying in last three months" as positive signal. Mixed factual data with some analytical interpretation.

**AskNews Articles:**
Multiple articles dated Feb 10-17, 2026. Key factual data: ROP traded at $321.41 on Feb 16 (up 0.5%), fell to $315.44 on Feb 17 (down 1.83% from $321.41). Trading volume $527.3M on Feb 16. Stock hit $317.67 52-week low on Feb 12. Articles confirm downward momentum with specific intraday prices. High quality recent price data.

**Older AskNews Articles:**
Jan-Oct 2025 articles on analyst recommendations and market structure. Less relevant for near-term 4-day prediction but confirm longer-term bearish analyst sentiment shift.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence (Large Prediction Shifts):**
1. **Confirmed recent downtrend with specific prices**: Multiple independent sources confirm ROP fell from $321.41 (Feb 16 close) to $315.44 (Feb 17 close), representing -1.83% decline. Stock hit new 52-week low of $314.56 intraday Feb 17. This is direct, verifiable price data from multiple sources establishing clear momentum.

2. **Wave of analyst downgrades from named firms**: Goldman Sachs (cut to $440), JP Morgan (Sell, $397), Oppenheimer (downgraded to Hold), RBC Capital ($398), Argus (downgraded to Hold), Citigroup ($450), Stifel ($385). Seven major firms downgraded or cut targets in late January 2026 following earnings. This represents institutional consensus on fundamental weakness.

3. **Disappointing guidance with specific metrics**: 2026 EPS guidance $21.30-21.55 below consensus, organic growth 5-6% below prior expectations, H2 2026 particularly weak. Revenue miss in Q4 ($2.06B vs $2.08B expected). Direct causal mechanism for continued selling pressure.

**Moderate Evidence (Moderate Prediction Shifts):**
1. **Sector headwinds from named expert**: Jim Cramer explicitly states enterprise software sector won't recover "any time soon," affecting ROP's 75%+ software revenue mix. Logical causal link but single expert opinion.

2. **Technical oversold indicators**: RSI < 30, Stochastic < 20 mentioned in outside view. Suggests potential bounce but oversold conditions can persist in strong downtrends. Historical pattern with mixed predictive power.

3. **Institutional selling pressure**: T. Rowe Price cut -43.9%, 692 institutions decreased vs 591 increased. Demonstrates continued distribution but timeframe unclear (Q3-Q4 2025 data).

**Weak Evidence (Small Adjustments):**
1. **Director purchase**: Single insider bought $502K at $358.46 on Feb 6. Anecdotal and price well above current level ($315.44), suggesting even insider may have mistimed.

2. **10-K filing risk on Feb 24**: Speculative that filing will contain negative surprises, though logical given recent guidance disappointment.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 4 trading days (Feb 19, 20, 23, 24 - assuming Presidents' Day Feb 21 is market holiday).

**Current Trajectory:** Stock fell -1.83% on Feb 17, continuing established downtrend. At this rate, stock would decline further by Feb 24.

**If timeframe halved (2 days):** Would increase probability of positive return to ~42-45%. Shorter timeframe reduces time for negative momentum to compound and increases impact of random daily volatility. Oversold bounce more likely over 2 days.

**If timeframe doubled (8 days):** Would decrease probability to ~30-33%. Longer timeframe allows fundamental headwinds (guidance disappointment, sector weakness) to fully manifest. 10-K filing risk would be realized. Analyst downgrades would have more time to influence institutional flows.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside View Base Rate: 37%**

**Factors Supporting Downward Shift (to 30-35%):**

1. **Confirmed price action on Feb 17**: The outside view was calibrated before knowing Feb 17's actual close. ROP fell -1.83% to $315.44, hitting intraday low of $314.56. This confirms the downtrend is accelerating, not stabilizing. Strong evidence that momentum persists.

2. **Proximity to 52-week low**: At $315.44, stock is only $0.88 above the Feb 12 low of $314.56. This suggests limited support and high probability of breaking to new lows. Technical breakdown more severe than outside view assumed.

3. **Jim Cramer's sector call**: Named expert explicitly states software sector won't recover soon. Given ROP's 75%+ software exposure, this adds conviction to bearish thesis beyond company-specific factors.

**Factors Supporting Upward Shift (to 38-40%):**

1. **Extreme oversold after Feb 17 decline**: With stock now at $315.44 vs $321.41 baseline, oversold conditions are even more pronounced. RSI likely below 25. Historical mean reversion probability increases at extreme levels.

2. **Distance from director purchase price**: Director paid $358.46 on Feb 6, now 13.6% above current price. While he may have mistimed, this creates a psychological support level and suggests some institutional buyers see value.

**Net Adjustment:**
The confirmed acceleration of the downtrend on Feb 17 (falling through $315 level) is strong evidence that outweighs the incremental oversold argument. The sector headwinds from Cramer add moderate conviction. However, the extreme oversold condition prevents a large downward shift.

**Shift from 37% to 34-35%**: The Feb 17 price action and sector commentary justify a 2-3 percentage point downward adjustment, but extreme technical conditions prevent going below 34%.

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view of 37%, I adjust downward to 35% based on:

1. **Feb 17 confirmed decline** (-1.83% to $315.44): Demonstrates momentum persists stronger than baseline assumption. Weight: -2 percentage points.

2. **Proximity to 52-week low** ($315.44 vs $314.56 low): Increases probability of breakdown to new lows. Weight: -1 percentage point.

3. **Cramer sector call**: Adds conviction to software weakness thesis. Weight: -1 percentage point.

4. **Extreme oversold conditions**: At $315.44, technical indicators likely at extremes, increasing bounce probability. Weight: +2 percentage points.

**Net adjustment: -2 percentage points from 37% to 35%**

However, considering the 4-day timeframe is very short and random daily volatility could easily produce a positive day even in a downtrend, I acknowledge uncertainty around the 33-37% range. The central estimate of 35% reflects:
- 65% probability stock continues declining or stays flat
- 35% probability of at least one strong bounce day that overcomes the downtrend

This feels calibrated: in 35 out of 100 similar scenarios (strong downtrend, extreme oversold, 4-day timeframe, sector headwinds), the stock would close higher. In 65 out of 100, it would close lower or flat.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will ROP close on Feb 24, 2026 be higher than Feb 18, 2026 close? Timeframe: 4 trading days.
   * ✓ Analysis focuses on 4-day price movement, considers momentum, technicals, and events in this window.

2. **Base rate**: Outside view established 37% probability for 4-day positive return given downtrend context.
   * ✓ Final 35% is anchored to this base rate with modest -2pp adjustment based on new evidence.

3. **Consistency check**: "35 out of 100 times, ROP's Feb 24 close exceeds its Feb 18 close."
   * ✓ This aligns with strong downtrend but acknowledges meaningful probability of oversold bounce.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence**:
   * Feb 17 close at $315.44 confirms accelerating downtrend (-1.83%)
   * Seven major analyst downgrades in late January with specific lower targets
   * Jim Cramer states software sector won't recover "any time soon"
   * Stock only $0.88 above 52-week low, extreme oversold conditions
   * ✓ All factually verified from multiple named sources.

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Surprise positive macro data (soft GDP/PCE on Feb 20) triggers broad market rally, lifting all boats including ROP despite company-specific weakness. Could shift probability to 45-50%.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Current status quo is continued decline. Over 4 days, modest volatility expected but trend likely persists. Slight nudge toward status quo (continued weakness) already incorporated in 35% vs 37% base rate.
