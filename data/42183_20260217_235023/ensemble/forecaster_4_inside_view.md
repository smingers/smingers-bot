Analysis:
Forecast question restated: Between the close on Wednesday 18 Feb 2026 and the close on Tuesday 24 Feb 2026 (four trading days later), will Roper Technologies’ (ROP) share price end higher?

(a) Source analysis (salient items only)
1. MarketBeat (17 Feb 26). 52-week low $314.56, closing $315.44. Lists 50-d MA $409, 200-d MA $464. Factual price/volume data (high quality), analyst opinions (medium quality, 12-mo horizon).
2. AInvest (11 Feb 26). Recaps Q4-25 earnings (EPS beat, revenue miss), guidance, recent –4.3 % drop. Factual numbers (medium), commentary on head-winds (opinion).
3. IndexBox / Barchart summaries (17 Feb 26). Same financials, reiterates –44 % YoY decline. Reliable for backward-looking data.
4. Jim Cramer clip (Finviz, 14 Feb 26). Opinion: stock unlikely to bounce until software recovers. Weak-to-moderate evidential weight (one commentator).
5. AskNews price tickers (16–17 Feb 26). Provide intraday price ($321.41 on 16 Feb, –22 % MoM) and confirm strong down-trend. High-quality factual tape data.
6. GuruFocus alerts (3 & 27 Jan 26). Show heavy post-earnings sell-off, analyst price targets, valuation metrics. Reliable for historical prices; targets are opinion.
No credible source indicates an imminent positive catalyst scheduled before 24 Feb; the only potential event is a routine 10-K filing on 24 Feb (unconfirmed).

(b) Evidence weighting
• Strong evidence, bearish:  
  – Persistent multi-week down-trend culminating in new 52-week low on 17 Feb (confirmed by two independent real-time sources).  
  – Price now far below all major moving averages, a configuration that historically favours continued weakness over the next week (~55 % base probability of further decline after a fresh 52-week low for large-caps; academic studies, e.g. George & Hwang 2004).  
• Moderate evidence, bullish:  
  – RSI <30 (oversold) and insider buying (~$5.6 m past 90 d) give a mild mean-reversion bias.  
  – Valuation multiples now at multi-year lows (P/E 22). May attract dip-buyers.  
• Weak evidence, bearish:  
  – Multiple analyst downgrades in late Jan/early Feb signal negative sentiment, though their horizon is 12 m+.  
• Weak evidence, bullish:  
  – Broad market drift is slightly positive over very long run; beta 0.93.

Net evidence tilt: Bearish (moderate).

(c) Timeframe analysis
Time to resolution: 6 calendar / 4 trading days.  If horizon were halved (2 trading days) I’d lean a bit more on momentum → probability of “Yes” ~45 %.  If doubled (8 trading days) oversold mean-reversion would gain weight → “Yes” ~49 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift
Outside-view base rate (large-cap, 4-day direction): 50.9 % chance of a rise.  
Adjustments:  
–4 % for strong downward momentum and fresh 52-week low (moderate evidence).  
+1 % for oversold / insider-buying mean-reversion (weak-to-moderate).  
Net inside-view estimate ≈ 47 %.

Consistency check: “In roughly 47 out of 100 comparable weeks, ROP would finish 24 Feb above 18 Feb.”

Probability calibration
Central estimate: 47 % chance the 24 Feb close > 18 Feb close.  90 % CI roughly 38 – 57 % (reflects very high short-term noise).

Checklist:
1. Title & criteria paraphrased correctly (4-day price direction).  
2. Outside view base: 50.9 %.  
3. “47 of 100 times, price ends higher” – consistent with reasoning.  
4. Key evidence: (i) new 52-wk low 17 Feb; (ii) price ≪ 50/200-d MA; (iii) oversold RSI/insider buys; (iv) no scheduled positive catalyst pre-24 Feb.  
5. Blind spot: A sudden sector-wide tech rebound or takeover rumour could lift ROP >10 % in days, flipping outcome.  
6. Status-quo outcome (continued drift down) slightly favoured; nudged probability below 50 %.

Probability: 47%
