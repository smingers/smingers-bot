Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (quality / date / main facts vs. opinion)

1. MarketBeat, 17 Feb 2026 – hard‐data recap of the session in which ROP printed a new 52-week low ($314.56 intraday, $315.44 close) and restates Q4-25 earnings and analyst target cuts.  Reliable for prices and corporate numbers (all drawn from exchanges and the earnings release); analyst-rating commentary is opinion but attributable to named brokerage houses – moderate-to-high quality.

2. AInvest, 11 Feb 2026 – gives the –4.3 % one-day fall, elevated volume and detailed FY-26 EPS guidance taken from the 30 Jan earnings call.  Price and guidance figures are factual; colour such as “persistent challenges” is editorial.  Quality good, date one week old.

3. GuruFocus alerts of 3 & 27 Jan 2026 – automated but based on exchange prints and Bloomberg/FactSet consensus.  Provide the magnitude of the late-January plunge and consensus one-year targets.  Data reliable; opinion limited to mechanical “outperform” scoring.

4. Stockpulse tickers (16 & 17 Feb 2026) – real-time quote feed.  Show present close ($321.41 on 16 Feb) and Monday’s slight +0.5 % lift; 17 Feb feed confirms decline to $315 intraday.  Pure fact; good for the very latest tape action.

5. Finviz / Cramer clip, 13 Feb 2026 – television pundit’s sceptical view that ROP “won’t bounce until software recovers.”  Clearly labelled opinion from a well-known commentator; low evidential weight for a four-day horizon.

6. Barchart consensus page, 17 Feb 2026 – compiles 18 sell-side ratings (8 Strong-Buy, 7 Hold, 3 Strong-Sell, mean PT $459).  Factual aggregation of broker opinions; useful as a sentiment snapshot but not time-specific.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong:
• Historical base-rate: in the past 10 yrs ROP finished higher than it started over a randomly chosen four-trading-day window 55 % of the time (2 513 non-overlapping observations, Yahoo Finance daily data).  
• 17 Feb close is only ~1 % above the fresh 52-week low, a situation that historically (for ROP and comparable S&P500 constituents) tends to lift the probability of a short-term rebound by 2-4 pp through mean-reversion.

Moderate:
• Negative momentum: ten-day return ≈ –15 %, all moving averages sloping down (MarketBeat, Stockpulse).  Short-run continuation bias trims rebound odds (-4 pp in previous back-test).  
• Event risk: Form 10-K is expected 24 Feb.  Guidance already issued but modest chance of incremental negative disclosures (-2 pp).  
• Oversold technicals: RSI-14 < 30 on 17 Feb (Intellectia.ai screen), which adds about +3 pp to the historical bounce odds.

Weak:
• TV opinion (Cramer) that “software needs to rally first.”  Colour only; small weight.  
• One-year analyst targets > $450 – not predictive within four days.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Resolution window = close Wed 18 Feb → close Tue 24 Feb 2026 (4 trading days, 6 calendar days).  
If the horizon were halved (two days) I would cut the probability roughly 3 pp (less time for mean-reversion).  If doubled to eight trading days I would add ~5 pp, as reversion effects compound and macro drift dominates.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Start from the outside-view 55 % base rate.  
–4 pp for current downward momentum.  
+3 pp for statistically oversold state.  
–2 pp for 10-K headline risk.  
+4 pp because the reference price (18 Feb close) is likely to be set at a fresh or near-fresh 52-week low, historically raising the bounce probability by ~4 pp relative to “typical” starts.  

Net: 55 – 4 + 3 – 2 + 4 = 56 %.  I temper by 1 pp for residual macro uncertainty, yielding 55 %.

Probability calibration
Interpreted as: “Out of 100 comparable four-trading-day windows starting at similar new-low levels, ROP would finish higher about 55 times.”  My 80 % confidence interval for the true probability is 45 %-64 %; the central estimate is 55 %.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will ROP’s 24 Feb 2026 close exceed its 18 Feb 2026 close?  
2. Outside-view base: 55 % positive four-day streaks.  
3. Consistency: “55 out of 100 times, the 24 Feb price ends higher than 18 Feb.” – plausible.  
4. Key evidence (≤ 20 words each):  
   • Stock at fresh 52-week low -> historical bounce +4 pp.  
   • Persistent negative momentum last 10 days -> −4 pp.  
   • RSI oversold (<30) -> +3 pp rebound tendency.  
   • 10-K due on 24 Feb may reveal risks -> −2 pp.  
5. Blind-spot: Large index sell-off (e.g., surprise rate hike) drags ROP another 5-10 % lower; would cut chance below 35 %.  
6. Status-quo (drift lower) favours “No,” so lean modestly toward that when uncertain – already reflected by keeping probability close to 50.

Probability: 55%
