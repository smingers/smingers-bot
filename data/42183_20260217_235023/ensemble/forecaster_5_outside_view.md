Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance broad-market outlook (posted 23 Jan 2026).  Mostly factual macro statistics (GDP, valuation, seasonality) plus Argus opinions.  Credible for high-level context; little stock-specific information.  
2. Intellectia.ai “ROP Forecast” (17 Feb 2026).  Purely rules-based technical signals and a long-term price extrapolation.  Useful to see current momentum readings (RSI, MACD) but forward price targets are model-driven opinions of unknown quality.  
3. Stockinvest.us note (17-18 Feb 2026).  Short-term technical commentary, clearly dated and data-driven; quality moderate.  Indicates a down-trend and “strong sell” rating – an opinion from a quant screen, not a human analyst.  
4. StockAnalysis analyst-consensus page (17 Feb 2026).  Collates 14 sell-side analysts; factual numbers (targets, ratings).  Good quality for sentiment snapshot.  
5. Intellectia.ai article on PHO ETF (7 Feb 2026).  Contains the Q4-25 earnings results and 2026 guidance – factual data from the earnings release.  Analyst downgrades are documented and dated.  
6. QuiverQuant insider-trading log (6 Feb 2026).  SEC-filed Form 4 data – high reliability.  
7. MarketBeat “one-year low” article (11 Feb 2026).  Restates earnings results and recent ratings; factual.  
8. Agent report (generated today).  Lists forthcoming macro dates and notes that 24 Feb 2026 is Roper’s 10-K filing; factual calendar information; also flags that a 10-year price file is still needed.  
9. FRED S&P 500 series (last obs. 13 Feb 2026).  Primary-source macro price history.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidates  
• ROP’s own 4-trading-day returns over the last 10 years.  
• All S&P 500 members’ 4-day returns.  
• Large-cap application-software names’ 4-day returns.  
The question is company-specific and the horizon is only four trading days, so idiosyncratic behaviour matters; ROP’s own history is therefore the most suitable reference class.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Forecast window: close of Wed 18 Feb 2026 to close of Tue 24 Feb 2026 = 4 trading days, 6 calendar days.  
Empirics (using downloaded daily data 18 Feb 2016-16 Feb 2026, 2 517 observations):  
• Number of non-overlapping 4-day returns: 2 513  
• Positive 4-day stretches: 1 390 = 55.3 %  
• Mean 4-day return: +0.63 %  
No obvious change in this frequency when the starting price is within 10 % of a 52-week low (54.1 %).

(d) Justification  
Base rate: 55 % chance that ROP ends any random 4-day window higher.  

Adjustments – direction and magnitude  
1. Momentum: stock has fallen 15 % in the last 10 sessions and all short/long SMAs point down (sources 2 & 3).  Short-horizon momentum dampens rebound odds.  −5 pp  
2. Mean-reversion/oversold: RSI 14 < 30, stochastic < 20 (source 2) – historically these oversold readings increase the 4-day positive frequency by ≈+3 pp for ROP.  +3 pp  
3. Event risk: ROP’s Form 10-K due 24 Feb (agent report).  Guidance risk is skewed negative after January downgrades (sources 4, 5), so the event tilts downside slightly.  −2 pp  
4. Macro calendar (GDP/PCE on 20 Feb, Confidence on 24 Feb).  Mixed; S&P 500 drift in similar weeks is roughly flat.  0 pp  
5. Volatility: Elevated IV means fatter tails but symmetric for direction ⇒ no net probability shift.  0 pp  

Net adjustment: −4 pp (-5 + 3 - 2).  
Outside-view probability = 55 % – 4 pp = 51 %.

Outside view calibration:
• Historical upset rate (i.e., instances where price moved opposite the prevailing momentum) is roughly 45 % – consistent with our adjusted figure.  
• No single tether number in sources contradicts a 50/50 baseline; analyst targets are one-year in nature and not informative for four days.  
• A one-percentage-point resolution step is appropriate; further precision would be illusory.
