<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve ROP daily closes for last 10 years; calculate frequency of 4-day positive returns and mean return; list scheduled corporate or macro events 19-24 Feb 2026 that could affect ROP or industrial software peers
1. Availability of 10-year daily closing prices for ROP  
• Macrotrends confirms that a complete split- and dividend-adjusted daily price series for Roper Technologies (ROP) exists back to 1992, with the latest close reported as $315.53 on 17 Feb 2026 (Macrotrends).  
• Yahoo Finance likewise maintains an uninterrupted history that can be downloaded through its API or yfinance library (yFinance).  
• The excerpts supplied here do not include the 2,500-plus individual observations needed to run the requested statistics, so the raw price file still has to be pulled.

2. How to calculate the 4-day-return statistics once the file is retrieved  
Let Ct be the adjusted close on trading day t.  Define the 4-day return Rt = (Ct / Ct-4) − 1.  
Over the 10-year window 18 Feb 2016 → 17 Feb 2026 there are about 2,520 trading sessions and therefore ≈2,516 non-overlapping 4-day returns.  
Metrics that need to be produced:  
• Frequency of positive four-day stretches = (# of Rt > 0) / (total # of Rt).  
• Mean four-day return = Σ Rt / (total # of Rt).  
Because the underlying data were not in the search results, these two summary numbers cannot yet be quoted.  Additional data download is therefore required (gap identified below).

3. Scheduled corporate events 19 – 24 February 2026 that could move ROP or its industrial-software peers  
Company-specific:  
• Roper Technologies – 24 Feb 2026: FY-2025 Annual Report release (Form 10-K) (Trendlyne).  The document often contains updated guidance and could directly affect the share price on 24 Feb.  
Peers most frequently held in industrial/vertical software baskets (Autodesk, ANSYS, Hexagon, Dassault Systèmes, PTC, Bentley, ServiceNow, Trimble): no earnings releases are currently scheduled for 19-24 Feb, but conference-presentation calendars continue to evolve.  A fresh check of individual investor-relations sites closer to the date is advisable.

Macro-economic (U.S. data dominate because ~77 % of Roper’s revenue is U.S.-sourced):  
Thursday 19 Feb 2026  
• U.S. Trade Balance, Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Survey, and Pending Home Sales – 08:30 ET & 10:00 ET (Scotiabank).  
Friday 20 Feb 2026  
• Advance 4Q GDP, Personal Income & Outlays (PCE inflation proxy), University of Michigan Sentiment – 08:30 ET & 10:00 ET (Scotiabank).  The PCE release is frequently cited on Roper conference calls because of its link to hospital-capital-spending outlooks.  
Monday 22 Feb 2026  
• No Tier-1 U.S. releases scheduled (Scotiabank).  
Tuesday 23 Feb 2026  
• No Tier-1 U.S. releases; however, the OECD composite leading index is tentatively set for that date (Trading Economics; subject to confirmation).  
Tuesday 24 Feb 2026  
• S&P/Case-Shiller 20-City Home Price Index – 09:00 ET  
• Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index – 10:00 ET  
• Conference Board Consumer Confidence – 10:00 ET (Scotiabank, Yahoo Finance calendar).  
Any upside or downside surprise in these indicators can sway the S&P 500 industrials subgroup and, by correlation, ROP.

International data that could spill over to U.S. risk appetite and software valuations:  
• Euro-area current-account balance (19 Feb), UK Retail Sales (20 Feb) and Euro-area January CPI final (25 Feb), all flagged by Scotiabank.  While not directly linked to Roper’s fundamentals, large surprises often reverberate through FX and global-growth narratives and therefore affect multi-national software names.

4. Current market backdrop heading into the 19-24 Feb window  
• ROP has been under significant pressure: the share price has fallen 40 % in six months and 23 % month-to-date (yFinance) amid a broad sell-off in vertical-software names tied to fears that generative AI tools could erode niche competitive moats (CNBC 11 Feb 2026; CNBC 16 Feb 2026).  
• Implied volatility for the 20 Feb weekly options stands at 55 % (calls) and 49 % (puts) (yFinance), roughly doubling the 12-month median and signalling elevated event risk around the economic releases and FOMC communications in the week directly ahead of the forecast window.  
• Sell-side consensus EPS target still embeds a sizeable recovery to ~$21.40 in FY-2026 (MarketBeat), so any incremental macro softness or guidance change in the forthcoming 10-K could trigger additional estimate revisions.

5. Information gaps that must be closed to finish the quantitative portion of the request  
• Full list of daily adjusted closes for ROP from 18 Feb 2016 through 17 Feb 2026 – neither Macrotrends nor the Yahoo Finance preview furnished the entire CSV in the snippets provided.  
• Once that file is downloaded, a very small code snippet (Python/R/Excel) can generate the 2,516 4-day returns and then compute:  
 – Count of positives  
 – Proportion positive  
 – Mean of all 4-day returns (or, if desired, the mean conditional on positive values only).  
Absent those raw closes, the frequency and mean cannot be numerically stated here.

6. Summary for the forecaster  
• Event watch-list: Roper 10-K (24 Feb), U.S. GDP/PCE (20 Feb), consumer-confidence and housing data (24 Feb).  All occur inside or immediately ahead of the 19-24 Feb forecasting window and are capable of altering the probability distribution for ROP’s 24 Feb close relative to 18 Feb.  
• Statistical base rate: needs completion; 10 years of history will show how often ROP has advanced over rolling 4-day spans, providing an empirical prior that can be blended with the event outlook.  
• Next action required: fetch the full Yahoo Finance or Macrotrends daily-price CSV; compute the two missing statistics to finalise the quantitative element of the forecast.

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?

Format your answer as below:

Outside view calibration:

Outside View Prediction:
Provide your outside view prediction as a percentage. Be precise — don't round to multiples of 5%.
