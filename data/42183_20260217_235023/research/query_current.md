Analysis:
To judge whether Roper Technologies’ (ROP) share price will be higher on 2026-02-24 than on 2026-02-18, I need very recent information that could move the stock in the next few trading days. The most relevant items include: (1) any earnings release or investor presentation scheduled or just released, (2) analyst upgrades/downgrades or target-price changes issued this week, (3) M&A announcements or large contract wins, (4) sector or macro news specifically affecting vertical-market software firms, and (5) overall market sentiment between now and February 24. Therefore I will look for news dated within the past few days (February 2026) and any scheduled events before Feb 24.
