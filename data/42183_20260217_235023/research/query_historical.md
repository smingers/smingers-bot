Analysis:
The question hinges on a very short-term (four trading days) price move for Roper Technologies (ticker ROP).  Useful historical context therefore includes:
• How often ROP’s price rises over a four-day window in the past (base-rate probability and average magnitude).  
• Typical February/late-February seasonality and any recurring post-earnings drift (ROP usually reports Q4 earnings in late January).  
• Near-term catalysts that could move the share price between 18 Feb and 24 Feb 2026 (e.g., guidance updates, conferences, ex-dividend date, macro data releases).  
• Recent news sentiment and analyst revisions that have occurred since the last earnings release.  
Combining these strands will give an outside view of the likelihood the close on 24 Feb will exceed that of 18 Feb.
