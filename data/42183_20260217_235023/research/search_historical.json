Availability of 10-year daily closing prices for ROP  \n\u2022 Macrotrends confirms that a complete split- and dividend-adjusted daily price series for Roper Technologies (ROP) exists back to 1992, with the latest close reported as $315.53 on 17 Feb 2026 (Macrotrends).  \n\u2022 Yahoo Finance likewise maintains an uninterrupted history that can be downloaded through its API or yfinance library (yFinance).  \n\u2022 The excerpts supplied here do not include the 2,500-plus individual observations needed to run the requested statistics, so the raw price file still has to be pulled.\n\n2. How to calculate the 4-day-return statistics once the file is retrieved  \nLet Ct be the adjusted close on trading day t.  Define the 4-day return Rt = (Ct / Ct-4) \u2212 1.  \nOver the 10-year window 18 Feb 2016 \u2192 17 Feb 2026 there are about 2,520 trading sessions and therefore \u22482,516 non-overlapping 4-day returns.  \nMetrics that need to be produced:  \n\u2022 Frequency of positive four-day stretches = (# of Rt > 0) / (total # of Rt).  \n\u2022 Mean four-day return = \u03a3 Rt / (total # of Rt).  \nBecause the underlying data were not in the search results, these two summary numbers cannot yet be quoted.  Additional data download is therefore required (gap identified below).\n\n3. Scheduled corporate events 19 \u2013 24 February 2026 that could move ROP or its industrial-software peers  \nCompany-specific:  \n\u2022 Roper Technologies \u2013 24 Feb 2026: FY-2025 Annual Report release (Form 10-K) (Trendlyne).  The document often contains updated guidance and could directly affect the share price on 24 Feb.  \nPeers most frequently held in industrial/vertical software baskets (Autodesk, ANSYS, Hexagon, Dassault Syst\u00e8mes, PTC, Bentley, ServiceNow, Trimble): no earnings releases are currently scheduled for 19-24 Feb, but conference-presentation calendars continue to evolve.  A fresh check of individual investor-relations sites closer to the date is advisable.\n\nMacro-economic (U.S. data dominate because ~77 % of Roper\u2019s revenue is U.S.-sourced):  \nThursday 19 Feb 2026  \n\u2022 U.S. Trade Balance, Philadelphia Fed Manufacturing Survey, and Pending Home Sales \u2013 08:30 ET & 10:00 ET (Scotiabank).  \nFriday 20 Feb 2026  \n\u2022 Advance 4Q GDP, Personal Income & Outlays (PCE inflation proxy), University of Michigan Sentiment \u2013 08:30 ET & 10:00 ET (Scotiabank).  The PCE release is frequently cited on Roper conference calls because of its link to hospital-capital-spending outlooks.  \nMonday 22 Feb 2026  \n\u2022 No Tier-1 U.S. releases scheduled (Scotiabank).  \nTuesday 23 Feb 2026  \n\u2022 No Tier-1 U.S. releases; however, the OECD composite leading index is tentatively set for that date (Trading Economics; subject to confirmation).  \nTuesday 24 Feb 2026  \n\u2022 S&P/Case-Shiller 20-City Home Price Index \u2013 09:00 ET  \n\u2022 Richmond Fed Manufacturing Index \u2013 10:00 ET  \n\u2022 Conference Board Consumer Confidence \u2013 10:00 ET (Scotiabank, Yahoo Finance calendar).  \nAny upside or downside surprise in these indicators can sway the S&P 500 industrials subgroup and, by correlation, ROP.\n\nInternational data that could spill over to U.S. risk appetite and software valuations:  \n\u2022 Euro-area current-account balance (19 Feb), UK Retail Sales (20 Feb) and Euro-area January CPI final (25 Feb), all flagged by Scotiabank.  While not directly linked to Roper\u2019s fundamentals, large surprises often reverberate through FX and global-growth narratives and therefore affect multi-national software names.\n\n4. Current market backdrop heading into the 19-24 Feb window  \n\u2022 ROP has been under significant pressure: the share price has fallen 40 % in six months and 23 % month-to-date (yFinance) amid a broad sell-off in vertical-software names tied to fears that generative AI tools could erode niche competitive moats (CNBC 11 Feb 2026; CNBC 16 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 Implied volatility for the 20 Feb weekly options stands at 55 % (calls) and 49 % (puts) (yFinance), roughly doubling the 12-month median and signalling elevated event risk around the economic releases and FOMC communications in the week directly ahead of the forecast window.  \n\u2022 Sell-side consensus EPS target still embeds a sizeable recovery to ~$21.40 in FY-2026 (MarketBeat), so any incremental macro softness or guidance change in the forthcoming 10-K could trigger additional estimate revisions.\n\n5. Information gaps that must be closed to finish the quantitative portion of the request  \n\u2022 Full list of daily adjusted closes for ROP from 18 Feb 2016 through 17 Feb 2026 \u2013 neither Macrotrends nor the Yahoo Finance preview furnished the entire CSV in the snippets provided.  \n\u2022 Once that file is downloaded, a very small code snippet (Python/R/Excel) can generate the 2,516 4-day returns and then compute:  \n\u2003\u2013 Count of positives  \n\u2003\u2013 Proportion positive  \n\u2003\u2013 Mean of all 4-day returns (or, if desired, the mean conditional on positive values only).  \nAbsent those raw closes, the frequency and mean cannot be numerically stated here.\n\n6. Summary for the forecaster  \n\u2022 Event watch-list: Roper 10-K (24 Feb), U.S. GDP/PCE (20 Feb), consumer-confidence and housing data (24 Feb).  All occur inside or immediately ahead of the 19-24 Feb forecasting window and are capable of altering the probability distribution for ROP\u2019s 24 Feb close relative to 18 Feb.  \n\u2022 Statistical base rate: needs completion; 10 years of history will show how often ROP has advanced over rolling 4-day spans, providing an empirical prior that can be blended with the event outlook.  \n\u2022 Next action required: fetch the full Yahoo Finance or Macrotrends daily-price CSV; compute the two missing statistics to finalise the quantitative element of the forecast.\n\nSources: Macrotrends (Roper Technologies daily price history); yFinance (current price, recent daily closes, option IV); Trendlyne (corporate calendar for ROP, 24 Feb 2026 10-K); Scotiabank Economic Release Calendar February 2026 (macro data schedule 19-24 Feb); CNBC 11 Feb 2026 & 16 Feb 2026 market narratives on software sell-off; MarketBeat 27 Jan 2026 ROP guidance update.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"SP500\" query=\"SP500\">\nFRED Economic Data: S&P 500\nSeries ID: SP500\nUnits: Index\nFrequency: Daily, Close\nLatest observation: 6836.17 (2026-02-13)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=6324.77, min=4982.77, max=6978.60\n- 5-year: mean=4932.67, min=3577.03, max=6978.60\n- 10-year: mean=3829.50, min=1895.58, max=6978.60\n- All-time: mean=3829.50, min=1895.58, max=6978.60 (since 2016-02-16)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: -90.43 (-1.3%)\n- 3-month change: +102.06 (+1.5%)\n- 6-month change: +386.37 (+6.0%)\n- Year-over-year: 6836.17 vs 6115.07 (+11.8%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily, Close):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-29,6969.01\n2026-01-30,6939.03\n2026-02-02,6976.44\n2026-02-03,6917.81\n2026-02-04,6882.72\n2026-02-05,6798.40\n2026-02-06,6932.30\n2026-02-09,6964.82\n2026-02-10,6941.81\n2026-02-11,6941.47\n2026-02-12,6832.76\n2026-02-13,6836.17\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
