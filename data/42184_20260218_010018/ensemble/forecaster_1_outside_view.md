## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **8-day forward volatility changes (most suitable)**
   - Timeframe: 8 calendar days (Feb 18 → Feb 26), approximately 6 trading days
   - From recent data: Daily volatility is moderate (±1-2 points typical, occasional ±2-3 point jumps)
   - Current level: 22.17, elevated but not extreme
   - Historical: Mean reversion tendency exists but volatility can persist for weeks

2. **Post-spike volatility behavior**
   - Current context: Just experienced +34% rise in February
   - Pattern: Volatility indices often mean-revert after spikes, but can remain elevated during uncertainty periods
   - 2025-2026 context suggests persistent uncertainty (tariffs, AI concerns, weak consumer confidence)

3. **Similar elevated volatility periods**
   - When VXVCLS is 20-25 range (current state), it typically stays elevated for weeks/months during uncertainty
   - Not in crisis mode (>30) but above long-term mean (~21)

**Selected Reference Class:** 8-day forward changes from elevated starting points (20-25 range)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 8 calendar days (Feb 18 → Feb 26), approximately 6 trading days

**Recent Pattern Analysis:**
- Feb 6: 20.37
- Feb 9-11: 20.09-20.43 (stable around 20)
- Feb 12-13: 22.17 (jump of ~2 points)
- Pattern: Recent spike suggests event-driven volatility, but stabilized at 22.17 for 2 days

**Historical 1-week changes:**
- Typical daily changes: ±0.5-1.5 points
- 6 trading days could see: -3 to +5 points from current level
- Mean reversion pressure exists (current 22.17 vs 1-year mean 20.93)
- But uncertainty factors support elevated levels

**Key Considerations:**
- Starting from elevated level (22.17)
- Recent stabilization (2 days at 22.17)
- Ongoing uncertainty (tariffs, consumer weakness, AI concerns per sources)
- No imminent crisis suggested, but volatility likely to stay above historical mean
- Weekend effect: Feb 22-23 are non-trading days

## (d) Justification

The VXVCLS currently stands at 22.17, elevated approximately 6% above its 1-year mean of 20.93 and notably above the recent early-February levels around 19-20. Multiple credible sources from mid-February 2026 document a significant volatility spike driven by AI sector concerns, tariff uncertainty, and weak consumer confidence.

The 8-day forecast window (6 trading days) is short enough that dramatic regime changes are unlikely but long enough for mean reversion forces or new volatility events to materialize. The recent pattern shows the index jumped from ~20 to 22.17 and has stabilized for 2 days, suggesting the immediate shock may be absorbed.

Key factors supporting a range around current levels:
- Persistent uncertainty factors (J.P. Morgan's May 2025 analysis of tariff impacts, ongoing AI sector volatility)
- Consumer confidence remains weak (Conference Board index at 84.5, expectations below recession threshold)
- Market volatility documented as elevated throughout early 2026

Mean reversion pressure suggests drift toward 20-21, but ongoing uncertainty could maintain elevation or cause further spikes. Historical data shows the index can move ±2-3 points in a week during uncertain periods, with larger moves (±5-10 points) reserved for major shocks.

The 1-year range of 17.72-41.50 provides outer bounds, but 8 days is insufficient for moves to extremes absent a major crisis (not indicated by sources). A realistic range centers on 19-24, with tails extending to 17-27 to account for unexpected developments.

## Outside View Calibration

**Distribution Considerations:**

1. **Central tendency:** Current value 22.17 is the natural anchor. Mean reversion suggests drift toward 20-21, but persistence of elevated volatility is equally plausible over 8 days.

2. **Symmetry:** Slight downward bias due to mean reversion, but uncertainty supports upside tail risk.

3. **Historical volatility of volatility:** Daily changes typically ±1 point, so 6 trading days could accumulate ±3-4 points under normal conditions, ±6-8 under stress.

4. **Tail risks:**
   - Downside (10th percentile): Rapid mean reversion + calming news → 18-19 range
   - Upside (90th percentile): New shock or persistent uncertainty → 26-28 range
   - Extreme scenarios (below 17 or above 30) possible but <10% probability given 8-day window

5. **Tethering to established distributions:**
   - Recent 2-week range: 19.37-22.45
   - 1-year range: 17.72-41.50
   - 6-trading-day moves historically: typically within ±3 points, occasionally ±5 points

6. **Rate of upsets:** Volatility indices are inherently volatile. Unexpected 1-day jumps of 2+ points occur monthly. Over 8 days, probability of at least one significant move is high (~40-50%).

**Calibration Strategy:**
- 10th percentile: Aggressive mean reversion scenario → ~19.0
- 20th percentile: Moderate mean reversion → ~20.0
- 40th percentile: Slight decline from current → ~21.0
- 60th percentile: Persistence near current level → ~22.5
- 80th percentile: Modest increase from uncertainty → ~24.5
- 90th percentile: Significant new volatility event → ~27.0

This distribution reflects: (1) current elevated starting point, (2) mean reversion tendency, (3) persistent uncertainty supporting elevation, (4) short timeframe limiting extreme moves, (5) realistic upset probability.
