## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **8-day forward movements in VXVCLS** (Feb 18 to Feb 26 = 6 trading days)
2. **Weekly changes during normal market conditions** (mean-reverting behavior)
3. **Weekly changes during elevated volatility periods** (current context)
4. **Historical distribution of VXVCLS values** (all-time)

**Most suitable: Combination of #2 and #3**
The current level (22.17) is moderately elevated above the 1-year mean (20.93) but well below historical spikes (max 72.98, 1-year max 41.50). Recent data shows the index has been volatile but oscillating in the 19-22 range. Over 6 trading days, mean-reversion is common but spikes can occur with market stress.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 6 trading days (Feb 18-26, 2026)

**Historical patterns over similar periods:**
- Recent 2-week window shows daily values: 19.37, 19.67, 20.07, 20.09, 20.35, 20.37, 20.43, 20.62, 22.17, 22.45
- Range: 19.37 to 22.45 (3.08 point spread)
- The index moved from ~20 to ~22 between Feb 6 and Feb 12-13
- One computed 5-day change: +2.78 points (+14.1%)
- Historical statistics show 1-year range: 17.72 to 41.50

**Key observations:**
- VIX-type indices are mean-reverting but can spike dramatically during market stress
- Current level (22.17) suggests moderate elevated concern
- 6 trading days is short enough that dramatic moves are possible but status quo is most likely

## (d) Justification

The VXVCLS currently sits at 22.17, approximately 6% above its 1-year mean of 20.93. Recent market commentary indicates elevated volatility driven by tariff concerns, AI sector uncertainty, and consumer confidence weakness. However, the index has been oscillating in a relatively stable 19-22 range over the past two weeks.

For a 6-trading-day forecast:
- **Base case (status quo):** The index remains in the 20-22 range, with mean reversion toward 21
- **Downside scenario:** Market calms, volatility compresses toward 18-20
- **Upside scenario:** New market stress (geopolitical, economic data, earnings disappointments) drives spike toward 25-30 or higher

Historical data shows the index can move 2-3 points in either direction over a week. The 1-year range of 17.72-41.50 demonstrates significant tail risk exists. Given current elevated but not extreme levels, and the short timeframe, I expect most probability mass between 19-25, with meaningful tail risk for spikes above 27.

Outside view calibration:

The challenge is balancing:
1. **Mean reversion tendency** - VIX indices typically revert to long-term means (20-21)
2. **Current elevated state** - Starting at 22.17 suggests ongoing market stress
3. **Short timeframe** - 6 days limits dramatic moves but doesn't eliminate them
4. **Recent volatility** - The index has shown 3-point ranges in 2-week windows
5. **Tail risk** - Historical max of 72.98 and 1-year max of 41.50 show extreme spikes are possible

I'll anchor my distribution around the current value (22.17) with slight downward bias toward the mean (20.93), but with wider tails to account for:
- Unknown market events in next 6 days
- Historical upset rate in volatility forecasting (frequent surprises)
- The asymmetric nature of volatility (can spike faster than it declines)

My percentiles should reflect:
- 10th-40th: Modest decline or stability (18-21 range)
- 40th-60th: Near current levels (21-23 range)
- 60th-80th: Modest increase (23-26 range)
- 80th-90th: Significant spike (26-32 range)

Percentile 40: 21.2
Percentile 60: 22.8
Percentile 80: 25.5
Percentile 90: 29.0
