Analysis:
(a) Source analysis
1. FRED (VXVCLS series page, obs through 12 Feb 2026). Highest-quality, raw data, no opinions. Latest close 22.17.
2. AskNews/Kiplinger et al. (17 Feb 2026). Reputable financial press; factual VIX ≈20-22 and commentary on AI-driven choppiness (opinions from E*TRADE, etc.).
3. Invezz / Cointelegraph (17 Feb 2026). Give spot VIX 22.5 on 17 Feb; generally reliable for market quotes, but mainly descriptive.
4. ING FX outlook (Jan 2026). Macro backdrop: expects 2026 to stay low-vol; credible house view but broad, not equity-specific.
5. Historical articles (2025 and earlier). Useful only as regime context; dated for an 8-day horizon.

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence
• FRED shows current VXV in low-20s → baseline.
Moderate evidence
• Multiple real-time market reports confirm VIX has risen from ~17 to ~22 in Feb → upward pressure on VXV in parallel.
• Macro calendar (FOMC minutes 19 Feb, PCE inflation 23 Feb) can move implied vol within days – logical causal link.
Weak evidence
• ING claim of subdued 2026 volatility (FX-focused) – indirect.
• Older 2025 spikes – historical illustration, not present catalyst.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Forecast horizon ≈ 8 calendar / 6 trading days. If horizon were halved, distribution would tighten about 15%; if doubled, widen (~25%) and tilt higher because longer window increases chance of shock.

(d) Justification / inside-view tweaks
Status quo: VXV ≈ 23–24 (extrapolating from 22.17 on 12 Feb plus VIX up 1.5-2 pts since then).
Near-term catalysts (Fed minutes, PCE) and ongoing AI/geo jitters favour slightly higher median vs base rate, but no clear crisis trigger. Typical 1-week one-sigma move ≈2–3 pts. Fat-tail shock risk (e.g., sudden tariff headline) justifies keeping 10% weight above 30. Downside tail to high-teens allowed if risk fades quickly after data.

Distribution calibration
Outside-view median 21.9 shifts to 24.0 (+~10%) on evidence of presently elevated short-term vol. Tails adjusted asymmetrically: larger upside potential than downside over 1 week given recent upward momentum and crowded AI-risk narrative.

Checklist:
1. Target: daily close of CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (VXVCLS, Index units) for 26 Feb 2026.
2. Base distribution given; final anchored to it with justified +1–2 pts shift.
3. Implied median = 24.0; mean ~24.6; consistent with rationale.
4. Key evidence: (i) latest VXV 22.17, (ii) VIX now 22.5 vs 20.8 on 12 Feb, (iii) Fed minutes/PCE imminent, (iv) historical 1-week VXV moves mostly ≤ ±3 pts, (v) no looming systemic shock.
5. Blind-spot: sudden geopolitical crisis (e.g., Gulf conflict) could push VXV >40 (upside).
6. Status-quo pull nudges forecast toward low-20s; retained.
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units = Index.
