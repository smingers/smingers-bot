Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED series VXVCLS (last close 2026-02-12 = 22.17).  Primary, machine-collected, no opinion – highest quality.  
2. FRED series VIXCLS (spot VIX closes through 2026-02-16 ≈ 21.2).  High quality, strongly correlated but shorter-tenor index.  
3. Recent news wires (Kiplinger, Invezz, TechJuice, Benzinga, etc., all dated 2026-02-17).  Agree that spot-VIX has risen to 22-23 on 17 Feb and that market volatility is “elevated but not crisis-like.”  Opinions come from named strategists (Chris Larkin, Adam Turnquist); factual element is the VIX print.  
4. Macro outlook pieces (ING Think, WSJ, Morningstar) are older and mainly colour.  Weak forward value for a one-week forecast.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Hard data: VXVCLS 22.17 on 12 Feb; VIXCLS 22 – 23 on 17 Feb.  
• Historical distribution: one-week absolute move |Δ| median ≈ 1.6, 80-pct ≈ 3.5, 95-pct ≈ 7.5.  Mean reversion well-documented.  

Moderate evidence  
• Cluster of reputable articles confirm a modest uptick in realised / implied volatility this week (VIX above 20).  
• Election-year / AI policy noise plausibly adds a mild upward bias relative to the unconditional mean.  

Weak evidence  
• Speculation that “AI scare” or tariffs could spark a sustained spike; no firm catalysts dated for the next six trading days.  
• Macro forecasts calling for “low 2026 volatility” (ING) – horizon mismatch.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution is 26 Feb 2026, six trading days away.  Halving the horizon (3 days) would slightly narrow σ (≈ 2.2 → 1.6 index pts); doubling (12 days) would widen σ to ≈ 3.3 pts and tug the mean a touch closer to its long-run value (~21).

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Base-rate (outside view) centre ≈ 21.8, σ ≈ 2.7 (fat-tailed).  
Inside information shows:  
• Current reading already 0.4–0.5 σ above mean.  
• Spot-VIX has advanced another ~2 pts since the last VXV print; historically VXV runs 1–3 pts above VIX.  That implies VXV today is likely around 24, not yet published.  
• No scheduled macro event (FOMC, CPI, earnings) of the magnitude usually needed for >7-point weekly jumps.  
Therefore I raise the central tendency about +0.7 index point versus the pure base rate (to 22.5-23) and fatten the upper tail modestly (extra 0.5 pt) to respect the chance of an unscheduled jolt (Trump tweet, AI shock).

Distribution calibration
Mean (≈ median for this symmetric shape) set to 23.0.  One-week σ taken as 2.8, then inflated 10 % for fat tails.  Percentiles pulled directly from that mixture and rounded to 0.5-pt where sensible.

Checklist:
1. Target: closing value of CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (index points) on 26 Feb 2026.  
2. Outside view stated above; final distribution still centres on long-run mean + modest bump.  
3. Implied median = 23.0; mean ≈ 23.1 – consistent with “slightly above normal but not panic.”  
4. Key evidence: (i) VXV 22.17 on 12 Feb; (ii) VIX 22-23 on 17 Feb; (iii) typical 6-day |Δ| < 3.5 pts; (iv) no major macro catalysts pre-26 Feb.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden geopolitical shock (e.g., Venezuela escalation) could drive VXV > 32, pushing my upper tail too low.  
6. Status-quo pull: regression-to-mean tempers the effect of the recent VIX pop.  
7. Percentiles rise monotonically; units = “Index”.
