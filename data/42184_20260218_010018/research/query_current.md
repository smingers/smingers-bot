Analysis:
The CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (ticker VXV) reflects the market’s expectation of S&P 500 volatility over the next three months. To estimate its level on 2026-02-26 (eight days ahead), I need:  
• The most recent daily closes for VXV and short-term trends.  
• News about upcoming market-moving events within the next week—FOMC minutes (2/19), major earnings, PCE release (2/26 morning), geopolitical or credit-risk developments—that historically shift implied volatility.  
• Commentary from options strategists on near-term volatility expectations, VIX term-structure changes, and any divergence between the 1-month (VIX) and 3-month (VXV) indices.  
Searching recent financial news and data services should surface these elements.
