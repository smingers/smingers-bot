Analysis:
To forecast the VXV level on 2026-02-26 I first need an “outside view”—the historical distribution of daily VXV values, especially over the last few years and around comparable market conditions.  Key pieces of context include: (1) the recent level and trend (e.g., 22.17 on 2026-02-12), (2) typical one-day and one-week changes, (3) the range seen during quiet vs. turbulent markets, and (4) any current news that might drive volatility higher or lower in the next week (earnings season, Fed minutes, geopolitical events, etc.).  
Therefore I want:
• A long-run history of VXV from FRED to compute basic statistics and recent momentum.  
• Recent articles mentioning the CBOE 3-Month Volatility Index or broader volatility conditions (Google News).  
• General web pages with downloadable VXV time series or analysis of its behavior (Google).  
• An Agent query to pull the exact FRED series for the past few years so I can calculate week-ahead changes and vol-of-vol.
