The S&P 500, Nasdaq, and Dow Jones all posted modest gains despite sharp intraday swings, with the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) rising to 20.24\u2014above its normal range of 12 to 20\u2014and up from 14.95 at the end of 2025. E*TRADE Managing Director Chris Larkin noted that while markets remain near record highs, frequent pullbacks due to AI-related uncertainty may create volatility, though they could also present opportunities in sectors where AI acts as a tailwind. The Empire State Manufacturing Index fell to 7.1 in February from 7.7 in January, in line with expectations, while the NAHB Housing Market Index dropped to 36 from 37, missing forecasts. Key upcoming data include the January FOMC meeting minutes and the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge. DTE Energy (DTE) reported fourth-quarter operating earnings of $1.65 per share, exceeding the $1.52 consensus, and surged over 30% in pre-market trading after reaffirming 2026 EPS guidance of $7.59 to $7.73\u20144.1% growth at midpoint versus 2025\u2019s $7.36. A conditional 2025 MPSC approval allowed DTE to supply 1.4 gigawatts to a $7 billion Oracle (ORCL)-backed data center in Saline Township, Michigan, with revenue from the 2045 contract (extendable) expected to cover costs without subsidizing data-center rates. Mizuho analyst Anthony Crowdell rated DTE Outperform (Buy) with a $144 target, citing its premium status due to AI-driven demand in Michigan. ZIM Integrated Shipping Services (ZIM) jumped 25.5% after Hapag-Lloyd (HLAGF) agreed to acquire it for $35 per share in cash, a $4.2 billion deal subject to approvals. The merger would create the world\u2019s fifth-largest container shipping company, combining over 400 vessels and forecasted annual cargo volume of over 18 million TEU by 2027.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 09:06 PM\nSource:[Kiplinger](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/stocks-make-more-big-up-and-down-moves-stock-market-today)\n\n**The 'Stock Picker's Market' Is Back \u2014 But The S&P 500 Is Still Hiding It**\nThe S&P 500's flat year-to-date performance in 2026 masks a significant structural shift in the market: the return of the 'stock picker's market,' according to Adam Turnquist, LPL's chief technical strategist. This shift is driven by declining correlations among stocks, rising performance dispersion, and a pivot from broad mega-cap tech exposure to more selective investing. The AI narrative has evolved from 'who wins from AI?' to 'who gets disrupted by AI?', creating new winners and losers beyond software. Capital is rotating out of tech\u2014where the Technology Select Sector SPDR (NYSE:XLE) makes up one-third of the S&P 500\u2014into value stocks, small caps, and international equities, amplifying ripple effects. The S&P 493, excluding the Magnificent Seven, is projected to see 2026 earnings grow by nearly 14%, up from 10% in 2025. Sector leadership has flipped: energy (Energy Select Sector SPDR, NYSE:XLE, 3.2% of S&P 500) has surged over 20% year to date, fueled by record ETF inflows. Active management is staging a comeback, with active equity ETFs capturing 32% of ETF flows\u2014up from 6% in 2021. The CBOE S&P 500 Dispersion Index is near multi-month highs, while the CBOE Three-Month Implied Correlation Index remains low, signaling expectations of idiosyncratic stock moves. This environment suggests that stock-specific narratives now matter more than broad market trends, signaling a need for active stock selection over passive beta exposure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 08:50 PM\nSource:[Benzinga News](https://www.benzinga.com/markets/equities/26/02/50667768/the-stock-pickers-market-is-back-but-the-sp-500-is-still-hiding-it)\n\n**Bitcoin Falls Below $70K as VIX Surges  --  BTC to PKR Risk Outlook**\nBitcoin fell below the $70,000 threshold, trading near $67,314 (approximately PKR 18.8\u201319.0 million), as rising US market volatility and declining Treasury yields triggered a risk-off sentiment across global markets. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) surged to 22.5, a level historically linked to reduced risk appetite and crypto weakness. This follows a consistent inverse relationship between VIX spikes above 20 and prior Bitcoin market tops in 2024 and 2025, often followed by steep corrections. The US 10-year Treasury yield dropped to 4.02%, its steepest weekly decline in months and nearing its long-term average for the first time since 2022\u2014indicating investor caution and capital rotation into safer assets, which typically pressures speculative markets like cryptocurrency. On-chain data reveals that stablecoin liquidity growth has slowed, with only modest exchange inflows over the past month, signaling limited fresh buying power compared to the robust inflows seen in late 2025 that previously supported Bitcoin rallies. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index entered extreme fear territory, a condition historically associated with market cycle bottoms but also with deeper bear-market phases when liquidity remains constrained. Analysts warn that unless Bitcoin reclaims $70,000 as a support level, it may retest its 2026 lows amid ongoing macro headwinds and tight liquidity, with a decisive breakout above $70,000 remaining the key bullish confirmation for both USD and PKR-denominated price action.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 06:38 PM\nSource:[TechJuice](https://www.techjuice.pk/bitcoin-falls-below-70k-as-vix-surges-btc-to-pkr-risk-outlook/)\n\n**Time to Load Up on Consumer Staples ETFs?**\nThe article discusses rising market volatility in early 2026, driven by geopolitical tensions, trade disputes, and a 'AI scare' trade that caused the S&P 500 to fall approximately 2% and the CBOE Volatility Index to rise 34% since February 1, with an additional 23% increase in the past week. As investor nervousness grows, the article argues for a defensive investment strategy, highlighting consumer staples ETFs as a resilient option. The S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index has gained 9.97% over the past year and 15.58% year-to-date. The case for increasing exposure is supported by three key factors: rising U.S. national debt\u2014projected by the Congressional Budget Office to reach $56 trillion (120% of GDP) by 2036\u2014heightens risk aversion; the AI trade has shifted from euphoria to exhaustion, with a 'sell first, ask questions later' mentality; and declining consumer confidence, with the Conference Board's Consumer Confidence Index falling to 84.5 in January (down 9.7 points from December) and the Expectations Index dropping to 65.1, below the 80 threshold typically signaling recession risk. Despite a modest February improvement in the University of Michigan's Index of Consumer Sentiment (up 1.6% to 57.3), both measures remain 11.4% below year-ago levels. The article recommends five consumer staples ETFs: XLP, VDC, IYK, FSTA, and RSPS. XLP is the most liquid (24.24 million shares average volume) and has the largest asset base ($17.26 billion), while FSTA and XLP have the lowest fees (0.08%), making them ideal for long-term investing. The article concludes that consumer staples ETFs offer downside protection during market pullbacks and steady returns during upswings, making them a strategic addition to portfolios amid growing uncertainty.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 06:06 PM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/time-load-consumer-staples-etfs)\n\n**Bitcoin Falls Under $70K as US VIX Index Signals Risk-off Conditions**\nBitcoin fell below $70,000 on Tuesday, with market indicators suggesting a continued risk of new annual lows if the price fails to establish support at this level. The U.S. CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) rose to 22.50, approaching its highest level since November 21, 2025, signaling growing uncertainty and a 'risk-off' sentiment, historically bearish for Bitcoin. This inverse relationship between Bitcoin and the VIX has been consistent: when the VIX exceeded 20 in December 2024, BTC peaked at $104,000; a surge above 25 in March\u2013April 2025 coincided with BTC\u2019s drop to $80,000; and a VIX rise in the fourth quarter aligned with BTC\u2019s cycle high near $126,000, followed by a drop below $100,000. Meanwhile, the U.S. 10-year Treasury yield fell 3.75% weekly\u2014the largest weekly decline since September 2025\u2014now at 4.02%, approaching its 200-period simple moving average (SMA) for the first time since March 2022, reflecting defensive positioning in traditional markets. The Crypto Fear & Greed Index dropped to 7, one of its lowest readings ever. Bitwise noted that while extreme fear has historically coincided with market bottoms, on-chain data showed BTC in profit positions only briefly touched 50% during a recent sell-off, a sign of deeper bearish cycles. CryptoQuant data revealed stablecoin reserves increased by $11.4 billion in the 30 days leading up to November 5, 2025, indicating strong buying power, but then declined by $8.4 billion by December 23, 2025, signaling capital withdrawal. In the past month, exchange reserves dropped modestly by $2 billion, showing a slowdown in outflows but no significant inflows, pointing to restricted liquidity. Binance dominated exchange liquidity, holding $47.5 billion in USDT and USDC\u2014about 65% of centralized exchange reserves\u2014up 36% year-over-year, with $42.3 billion in USDT. Analyst Maartunn noted that USDC inflows to exchanges are again declining, indicating that new liquidity has not yet returned at scale.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 04:58 PM\nSource:[Cointelegraph](https://es.cointelegraph.com/news/macro-headwinds-test-bitcoin-price-as-dollar70k-crumbles-amid-us-market-volatility)\n\n**US stocks open mixed: Nasdaq slips 0.4%, Dow up 180 points - Invezz**\nUS stocks opened mixed on Tuesday, February 17, 2026, following the Presidents' Day holiday, with the Nasdaq Composite declining 0.7% and marking its fifth consecutive weekly loss\u2014the longest losing streak since 2022. The S&P 500 fell 0.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose 180 points, or 0.4%. Technology and software stocks led the decline, with Meta Platforms and Nvidia each slipping 0.4%, Palantir Technologies dropping over 2%, and memory chipmakers Micron Technology and SanDisk trading lower. The iShares Expanded Tech-Software Sector ETF fell 0.7%, contributing to a year-to-date loss of about 22%. Concerns over artificial intelligence disrupting traditional software providers continued to pressure the sector. The S&P 500 and Dow each recorded four losing weeks in the past five, while the Nasdaq\u2019s streak extended to five. Mixed economic data\u2014softer-than-expected January CPI and a stronger-than-anticipated jobs report\u2014has heightened uncertainty. Investors are now focused on the upcoming personal consumption expenditures (PCE) report, the Fed\u2019s preferred inflation gauge, and the release of Federal Reserve meeting minutes on Wednesday. Market volatility rose, with the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX) climbing to 22.50, up from near 17 at the start of the prior week. Notable individual movers included Warner Bros. Discovery rising 2.4% and Paramount Skydance surging nearly 4% after Netflix granted a seven-day waiver for merger talks. In healthcare, Masimo jumped over 33% on acquisition rumors with Danaher at $180 per share ($10 billion in cash), while Danaher shares fell more than 7%.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 02:47 PM\nSource:[Invezz](https://invezz.com/news/2026/02/17/us-stocks-open-mixed-nasdaq-slips-0-4-dow-up-180-points/)\n\n**S&P 500 Dispersion Surges as Bankinter Launches Inverse Fund Betting on Decline**\nThe dispersion among S&P 500 stocks has sharply increased in early 2026, with a 11% rise in one month according to eToro analysts, indicating growing divergence between top-performing and underperforming companies. Despite this volatility, the S&P 500 index itself has remained nearly flat, registering a slight decline of 0.14% year-to-date. The Cboe Dispersions Index (DSPX), which measures how much individual stocks deviate from the S&P 500\u2019s overall trend, has risen from 29.54 at the start of 2026 to 36.13, a 22% increase, signaling a shift toward a more fragmented and unpredictable market. This growing dispersion, coupled with a 37% surge in the VIX volatility index, reflects heightened investor uncertainty, though the market has not yet entered a state of extreme nervousness. The trend suggests that stock selection is now more critical than ever, as sector rotations are abrupt and narratives shift rapidly\u2014evidenced by the decline of sectors like software, financial advisory, and logistics despite the AI-driven rally. In response, Bankinter has launched the Bankinter Inverso EEUU fund, designed to deliver returns inversely correlated to the S&P 500 Net Total Return. The fund employs short positions in futures and ETFs, with a recommended investment horizon of just one day, as longer-term holding may lead to significantly different outcomes. The fund is available from \u20ac1 with management fees of 0.5% for discretionary and independent advisory contracts and 1% otherwise. This move reflects a strategic bet on potential near-term S&P 500 declines, especially as the index\u2019s 2025 performance\u2014up 16.4%\u2014may not be sustained in 2026, where year-to-date gains are already at 3.96%.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 01:40 AM\nSource:[El Espa\u00f1ol](https://www.elespanol.com/invertia/mercados/20260217/dispersion-perdedores-ganadores-sp-dispara-bankinter-lanza-fondo-vaticina-caida/1003744131976_0.html)\n\n**Trump\u2019s Second Term: Markets Reeling from 'Event Risk' Amid Rising Volatility**\nAs the second term of Donald Trump's U.S. administration enters its first year, investors are increasingly adapting to 'event risk'\u2014sudden, unpredictable news events causing significant market volatility. According to the Wall Street Journal (WSJ), such events\u2014like potential steel tariff reductions, the appointment of a new Federal Reserve chair, and the emergence of new AI tools\u2014can trigger billions in market value shifts within a single day. Notable examples include unexpected developments in U.S.-Venezuela military operations, a proposed 10% cap on credit card interest rates, mortgage bond purchases by a housing finance company, and Japan's monetary policy changes. The CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), known as the 'fear gauge,' has seen its daily volatility median rise from 3.5% during the final year of President Joe Biden\u2019s term to 4.2% under Trump\u2019s second term. The VIX closed above the psychological resistance level of 20 on 66 days since Trump\u2019s second term began. Stock market volatility during earnings season has also surged, with S&P 500 companies averaging a 5.2% price swing on earnings days\u2014its highest level since 2012. Gold prices rose 65% over the past year, peaking above $5,300 per troy ounce before retreating to around $5,000 amid speculation that 'hawkish' Kevin Warsh, a potential new Fed chair, could be appointed. The U.S. dollar also experienced sharp declines after Trump expressed no concern about its depreciation. In response, some investors are diversifying portfolios by shifting capital to European Union markets, India, defense stocks, and emerging markets. Stephen Colano of Integrated Partners noted growing interest in Europe and emerging markets with independent trade relations. Paul Christopher of Wells Fargo Investment Institute advised investors to look beyond initial aggressive statements and focus on underlying negotiation dynamics. Michael Rosen of Santa Monica Angels Investment stated they have, for the first time in about 20 years, begun buying small-cap stocks and reducing U.S. asset exposure in favor of European and emerging market investments.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 10:07 PM\nSource:[\ub274\uc2dc\uc2a4 (NEWSIS)](https://www.newsis.com/view/NISX20260217_0003516947)\n\n**Wall Street in Chaos: How Investors Are Learning to Navigate an Unpredictable Market**\nWall Street is navigating a highly volatile market environment driven by unpredictable events from Washington, including sudden policy shifts via social media, unexpected AI advancements, and geopolitical developments. Stock market volatility has surged, with the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) averaging 4.2% daily\u2014up from 3.5% under former President Joe Biden. The S&P 500 saw record volatility during earnings season, with 15 stocks swinging 15% or more in a single day. Events such as a logistics firm\u2019s AI update triggered a 15% drop in trucking stocks, while gold surged 65% in 2025 to exceed $5,300 per troy ounce amid trade wars, fiscal deficits, and currency fluctuations. The sudden appointment of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve Chair caused a sharp dollar rally and gold decline. Investors are responding by shifting capital to Europe and emerging markets, increasing exposure to European defense firms and diversifying portfolios. Firms like Integrated Partners and Angeles Investments are adopting 'agile mindsets' to filter noise, focusing on reinforcing trends like AI spending and deregulation. As Paul Christopher of Wells Fargo notes, 'You have to look beyond the initial maximalist reaction, because it will be subject to negotiation.' Michael Rosen of Angeles Investments emphasizes the need to 'dedicate much more time to filtering the vast amount of noise' to identify what truly matters. Carrying out these strategies, investors are building more diversified portfolios than ever before.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 07:00 PM\nSource:[El Confidencial](https://www.elconfidencial.com/mercados/the-wall-street-journal/2026-02-16/mercado-caotico-inversores-lidiar-con-sorpresas_4303900/)\n\n**How Investors Are Preparing for Market Volatility in 2026**\nInvestors and fund managers are adapting strategies to a persistent global market volatility environment driven by unpredictable economic policy decisions, rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, and geopolitical shocks. According to the Wall Street Journal, the first year of Donald Trump\u2019s second term solidified the concept of 'event risk'\u2014where unexpected news triggers abrupt price swings within hours. Events that once required months of negotiation in Washington now emerge via social media posts, capable of adding or erasing billions in market value before trading begins. Recent examples include speculation over steel tariffs and the nomination of Kevin Warsh as Federal Reserve chair. AI-driven disruptions have rapidly affected sectors including insurance, data providers, wealth management, and trucking. Despite U.S. stock indices remaining near record highs, ongoing news shocks have prompted investors to diversify beyond the U.S., increasing exposure to foreign markets and safe-haven assets. Stephen Kolano, CIO at Integrated Partners, redirected capital toward regions with more independent trade relations from Washington, such as the European Union and India, expanding positions in European defense and emerging market equities. Volatility indicators reflect this tension: the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), known as Wall Street\u2019s 'fear gauge,' rose to a median daily fluctuation of 4.2%\u2014up from 3.5% in the final year of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency. The VIX closed above 20 on 66 trading days in Trump\u2019s second term\u2019s first year, compared to zero such days in his first term. Earnings season also became more volatile, with S&P 500 stocks averaging 5.2% daily swings on reporting days\u2014the highest since 2012\u2014with some shares moving 15% or more. Volatility extended beyond equities: trade wars, rising public spending, and a falling dollar drove gold up 65% in 2025, surpassing $5,300 per troy ounce in January. However, a Fed nomination announcement triggered a dollar rally and gold correction. Pension funds are increasingly hedging against abrupt dollar swings, as seen in January when the dollar dropped sharply after Trump downplayed devaluation risks. PIMCO\u2019s research advises investors to adopt an 'agile mindset for uncertainty,' emphasizing continuous valuation monitoring, geographic flexibility, and rapid responses to volatility-driven opportunities. The recommendation is to avoid impulsive reactions to headlines and instead focus on structural trends like deregulation and AI investment. In practice, portfolios are shifting: Michael Rosen of Angeles Investments reduced U.S.-centric exposure and increased positions in Europe and emerging markets, stating, 'The noise has increased dramatically relative to the signal. The portfolio is more diversified than ever.'\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 10:01 AM\nSource:[Exame](https://exame.com/invest/mercados/como-investidores-se-preparam-para-a-volatilidade-do-mercado-em-2026/)\n\n**The S&P 500 Is Near Record Highs, But Volatility Is Rearing Its Ugly Head. The Best Way to Play It Now.**\nThe S&P 500 is approaching record highs in January 2026, but market volatility is rising, marking a shift from the low-volatility environment of the late 2010s to what analysts describe as a 'high-floor era'\u2014where the CBOE Volatility Index ($VIX) rarely falls below 15 and often spikes toward 30. While short-term VIX ETFs like VXX and VIXY are popular during market dips, they suffer from rapid value erosion due to time decay. In contrast, the ProShares VIX Mid-Term Futures ETF (VIXM), with $58 million in assets, tracks VIX futures with a weighted average maturity of five months, offering a more stable and less volatile hedge. By holding longer-dated contracts (e.g., May, June, and July 2026), VIXM benefits from a flatter price curve, reducing holding costs and enabling longer-term portfolio protection. During the first half of January 2026, while the S&P 500 remained flat, VIXM gained approximately 5%, demonstrating its role as a counterbalance to tech-heavy portfolio wobbles. VIXM is not as reactive as short-term products, but it remains resilient after initial market panic, making it ideal for investors facing prolonged uncertainty. With the S&P 500 near record valuations amid stagnant earnings and rising geopolitical tension, VIXM serves as a strategic ballast and insurance policy, providing negative correlation to the S&P 500 and protecting against both sudden crashes and sustained volatility. Institutional managers are expected to rely on VIXM to preserve year-to-date gains if the VIX continues making higher lows in Q1 2026. For DIY investors, VIXM enables exposure to market upside while cushioning downside risk.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 08:53 PM\nSource:[Barchart.com](https://www.barchart.com/story/news/37306540/the-s-p-500-is-near-record-highs-but-volatility-is-rearing-its-ugly-head-the-best-way-to-play-it-now)\n\n**US markets brace for volatile start as jobs data and geopolitics take centre stage**\nThe U.S. stock market entered the first full trading week of 2026 amid expectations of heightened volatility, driven by geopolitical tensions, key economic data, and the start of the corporate earnings season. According to Reuters, Wall Street ended 2025 with a modest December decline, but the S&P 500 still gained over 16% for the year\u2014its third consecutive year of double-digit returns. The Cboe Volatility Index remained near annual lows. A major catalyst for market concern was the announcement by U.S. President Donald Trump that the U.S. would place Venezuela under temporary control following the capture of President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro, which market strategists say could trigger oil price volatility and ripple through equities. Investors are also monitoring a pending U.S. Supreme Court ruling on Trump-era tariffs, the upcoming Federal Reserve chair appointment, and the start of the Q4 earnings season. On January 1, the S&P 500 rose slightly, supported by semiconductor stocks. Economists forecast a 55,000-job increase in December\u2019s payroll report, following a 64,000 gain in November, with the unemployment rate at 4.6% in November. The Federal Reserve remained divided on monetary policy in December, with inflation still above the 2% target. Fed funds futures indicate a low probability of a rate cut in late January, but a roughly 50% chance of a 25-basis-point cut by March, per CME Group. Additional data, including manufacturing and services activity, job openings, and the CPI report on January 13, will be closely watched after a 43-day government shutdown delayed prior releases. JPMorgan and other major banks are set to report Q4 earnings starting January 13, with analysts expecting strong results to support elevated stock valuations. Market experts warn that equities face a pivotal moment in early 2026, with economic data, corporate results, and global developments poised to shape investor sentiment.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 05, 2026 04:25 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/us-stocks/news/us-markets-brace-for-volatile-start-as-jobs-data-and-geopolitics-take-centre-stage/articleshow/126344087.cms)\n\n**Wall Street's 'fear gauge' shows investors feeling confident heading into 2026 - and overlooking some big risks**\nThe Cboe Volatility Index (VIX), Wall Street's 'fear gauge,' is on track to finish 2025 at its lowest level since December 2024, with recent trading at 13.85 and a projected end-of-year close near its calendar-year lows\u2014within 2% of the lowest level since the index's inception in 1990. This reflects strong investor confidence heading into 2026, despite a volatile year that saw the VIX peak at 52.33 in April, its highest since April 2020. The S&P 500 was on a four-day winning streak and could close 2025 at record highs, supported by broadening market participation, including gains in financials, materials, and small-cap Russell 2000 stocks. Positive sentiment is driven by a strong U.S. GDP report showing the fastest growth in two years, expectations of increased government spending via President Trump\u2019s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, and a revised Federal Reserve median forecast for 2026 GDP growth. However, concerns remain: rising inflation could delay Federal Reserve rate cuts, and investor complacency is evident in Bank of America\u2019s bull-and-bear indicator reaching 8.5\u2014triggering a contrarian 'sell' signal. The AI trade has also splintered, with Ed Yardeni downgrading technology and communication-services sectors after 15 years, citing intensified competition among the 'Magnificent Seven' giants as AI disrupts their monopolies. While front-month VIX futures traded at 17\u2014low historically but higher than the spot VIX\u2014suggests some underlying caution. Despite optimism, analysts warn that overconfidence may be overlooking significant risks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 23, 2025 08:08 PM\nSource:[Morningstar](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/2025122389/wall-streets-fear-gauge-shows-investors-feeling-confident-heading-into-2026-and-overlooking-some-big-risks)\n\n**The Stock Market's Fear Gauge Is Starting to Flash**\nThe stock market's fear gauge, the CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), surged to a high of 28.27 on Thursday, its highest intraday level since October 17, 2025, before retreating to 26.05. The VIX measures implied volatility in the S&P 500 over the next month; a reading around 20 is considered normal, so values above this indicate heightened market volatility and investor anxiety. The spike reflects growing concerns in financial markets as of November 22, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 22, 2025 01:41 AM\nSource:[Barrons](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/stock-market-news-today-112025/card/the-stock-market-s-fear-gauge-is-starting-to-flash-Xo5bLjboVtJJ4feVfaq6)\n\n**Stock Markets Appear Calm, But Sudden Volatility Spikes Reveal Underlying Fragility**\nFinancial markets appear calm on the surface, but recent events reveal underlying fragility that concerns Wall Street experts. On October 16, 2025, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) hit its highest level in six months despite only a 0.6% drop in the S&P 500, triggering disproportionate fear among investors. The spike was more severe than those seen during major market shocks in August 2024, the 'Volmageddon' crash in February 2018, and even the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008. UBS analysts attributed the reaction to traders selling S&P 500 options, which worsened volatility when they attempted to hedge by repurchasing positions. However, Bank of America researchers argued that technical trading issues\u2014rather than genuine market fear\u2014were the main driver, noting that only about 17% of volatility-linked product holders would need to sell to offset market makers' actions. The growing scale of leveraged exchange-traded funds (ETFs), which manage around $160 billion globally, is amplifying systemic risk. These funds, especially 2x and 3x leveraged ETFs tied to major stocks like Nvidia and Tesla, rebalance daily near market close, sometimes creating trading volumes up to 200% of normal levels, significantly impacting prices. According to Antoine Porcheret of Citigroup, the top 10 stocks account for about 65% of the leveraged ETF value. Banks face approximately $300 billion in market risk exposure from these funds, including gap risk\u2014where a company\u2019s collapse could trigger a 100% loss for a double-leveraged fund, doubling the loss for banks providing protection. While banks currently mitigate this risk through complex derivatives, the system remains vulnerable to negative feedback loops during high volatility.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 08:45 AM\nSource:[Cryptopolitan - Portuguese](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/pt/stock-markets-show-signs-of-weakness/)\n\n**Stock Markets Appear Calm, But Sudden Volatility Spikes Reveal Underlying Fragility**\nFinancial markets appear calm on the surface, but recent events reveal underlying fragilities that concern Wall Street experts. On October 16, 2025, the Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) hit its highest level in six months despite the S&P 500 declining only 0.6%, signaling heightened investor fear over potential risks in small regional banks. This reaction was more intense than during major market crises including August 2024, the 'Volmageddon' event in February 2018, and even the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008. Experts from UBS Group AG found that options sellers on S&P 500 stocks worsened the situation by buying back positions amid market declines, amplifying volatility. However, Bank of America Corp. researchers argue that the spike was primarily due to technical trading issues rather than genuine market panic, noting that only about 17% of volatile product holders would need to sell to offset dealer actions. The rapid volatility spikes highlight systemic risks amplified by the $160 billion global market of leveraged ETFs. These funds, which use complex strategies to deliver 2x or 3x returns on indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq 100, can trigger negative feedback loops when rebalancing\u2014especially during high volatility. The top 10 stocks account for about 65% of leveraged ETF assets, and some single-stock funds may trade volume equivalent to 100%\u2013200% of normal daily turnover, significantly impacting prices. Banks face substantial risk, with approximately $300 billion in exposure to leveraged ETF-related risks, including 'gap risk'\u2014where a stock's price drops to zero, causing a 100% loss for a 2x leveraged fund and doubling the loss for the bank's protective derivatives. Banks mitigate this by selling derivatives to large clients, avoiding the persistent balance sheet risks seen in past crises.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 27, 2025 08:30 AM\nSource:[Cryptopolitan - Italian](https://www.cryptopolitan.com/it/stock-markets-show-signs-of-weakness/)\n\n**After Volatility Peak, Best 3-Month Market Period Begins**\nThe CBOE Volatility Index (VIX), often referred to as the 'fear index,' reached a peak in October 2025, consistent with its historical pattern of peaking during this month. Despite August and September 2025 showing strong positive performance for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq, the VIX began rising in late August, signaling increased investor uncertainty. Historically, the VIX tends to decline after its October peak, marking the start of a strong three-month period for equities from November to January. Data from 1950 show the S&P 500 has averaged a +4.4% return during this period, while the Nasdaq has averaged +6.2% since 1971. The current macroeconomic environment and cautious monetary policy may support a year-end rally.

The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX) rose to 22.44 from 20.81 the previous day and 16.43 on October 9, exceeding its 'normal' range of 12\u201320. All three major indices\u2014Dow Jones Industrial Average, S&P 500, and Nasdaq Composite\u2014briefly dipped into negative territory before recovering, with the Dow closing down 0.04% at 46,253, the S&P 500 up 0.4% at 6,671, and the Nasdaq Composite gaining 0.7% to 22,670. Strong third-quarter earnings from Morgan Stanley (MS) and Bank of America (BAC) boosted both stocks by 4.7% and 4.4%, respectively, driven by robust revenue and earnings growth. Morgan Stanley reported EPS of $2.80 on $18.2 billion in revenue, surpassing expectations of $2.10 and $16.7 billion. Bank of America reported EPS of $1.06, beating the forecast of 95 cents, with revenue rising 11% to $28.1 billion. Meanwhile, the federal government shutdown delayed the release of the September Consumer Price Index (CPI), pushing it to October 24. Wells Fargo economists Sarah House and Nicole Cervi estimate headline CPI rose 0.4% in September, lifting the year-over-year rate to a 16-month high of 3.1%, with core inflation also rising 0.3% for the third consecutive month. They caution that the shutdown threatens data collection for October\u2019s CPI and warn of possible report cancellation. Despite this, they project inflation will remain near 3% through mid-2026. Navitas Semiconductor (NVTS) surged 21.0% on Wednesday, adding to gains of 21.1% and 26.1% earlier in the week, rising 96% since October 8, driven by progress in developing advanced power devices for Nvidia\u2019s 800 VDC AI factory computing platforms. Navitas\u2019 gallium nitride (GaN) and silicon carbide (SiC) semiconductors enable direct IT rack power delivery without additional converters, enhancing efficiency and reducing copper use, according to the company.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 15, 2025 08:06 PM\nSource:[Kiplinger](https://www.kiplinger.com/investing/stocks/dow-recovers-from-666-point-slide-stock-market-today)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
