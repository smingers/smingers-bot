The date (February 19, 2022) indicates this is historical content from over two years ago.\n\n### Key Points:\n\n**Observations about VIX 3-Month (VXV) vs. Standard VIX:**\n- The author finds that the VIX 3-Month provides a \"smoother and cleaner version\" of the standard VIX\n- Before significant VIX spikes, signals develop over 6+ months\n- Prior to spikes, there is observable \"loss in momentum when vix starts to base failing to make new lows or significant new lows\"\n\n**Economic Concerns (as of February 2022):**\n- The author questions whether the economy will \"hit a wall\"\n- Notes that stock markets had already priced in economic reopening over the previous year with lower inflation numbers and massive quantitative easing (QE)\n- Raises concerns about inflation: \"How do the markets avoid hitting this inflation wall?\"\n- References the Federal Reserve's characterization of inflation as \"transitory\" and questions if there is \"enough QE left to jump this wall\"\n\n**Technical Observation:**\n- References a Bloomberg tweet from Tracy Alloway noting that the one-month VIX had just tipped over the 3-month VXV\n- While this crossover has occurred many times historically, the author notes \"a rather large divergence between the VXV/VIX ratio and the SPX\"\n\n**Note:** These are trading commentary snippets from early 2022 and do not contain specific statistics, forecasts, or quantitative data relevant to predicting the February 2026 value.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cboe.com/en/tradable-products/vix/vix-historical-data/\">\n## Summary of Article\n\n**Source:** Cboe Global Markets\n\n**Key Information:**\n\n1. **About the VIX Index:**\n   - The Cboe Volatility Index (VIX Index) is described as \"the world's premier gauge of U.S. equity market volatility\"\n   - Originally introduced in 1993, designed to measure 30-day volatility expectations based on S&P 100 Index option prices\n   - Updated in 2003 (in collaboration with Goldman Sachs) to be based on the S&P 500 Index\n   - Current methodology estimates expected volatility by aggregating weighted prices of S&P 500 puts and calls over a wide range of strike prices\n\n2. **Related Indices:**\n   - Cboe calculates and disseminates dozens of volatility indices (seven are specifically listed on their website, though not detailed in this excerpt)\n   - The VXO Index (Cboe S&P 100 Volatility Index) matches the values of the original 1993 VIX Index version\n\n3. **Data Availability:**\n   - Daily closing values are available via links on the Cboe website\n   - Historical data on volume, open interest, and prices for VIX Index futures is also available\n\n**Note:** This article provides general background information about Cboe's volatility indices but does not contain specific data values, forecasts, or analysis relevant to the VXVCLS (S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index) question. The article focuses on the VIX Index (30-day volatility) rather than the 3-month volatility index specified in the forecasting question.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.jpmorgan.com/insights/markets/top-market-takeaways/tmt-the-first-100-days-what-trumps-policies-mean-for-investors\">\n# Summary of J.P. Morgan Article: \"The First 100 Days: What Trump's Policies Mean for Investors\"\n\n**Date:** May 02, 2025\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n### Economic Data:\n- **U.S. Q1 2025 GDP:** Declined -0.3%, mostly in line with market consensus\n- **Net exports contribution to GDP:** -4.8% (largest-ever drag on growth from net exports)\n- **Domestic demand:** Added 2.5 percentage points to GDP growth, exactly matching Q4 2024\n- **Expected inflation:** Consumers expecting 5% inflation over the next 12 months (University of Michigan survey)\n- **Recession probability:** 40% median probability of U.S. recession in next 12 months (Bloomberg survey of forecasters)\n\n### Tariff Information:\n- **Current U.S. effective tariff rate:** Estimated at highest level since the 1930s\n- **Initial \"Liberation Day\" tariffs:** Approximately 25% effective rate\n- **Current tariff rate (after adjustments):** Around 15% (as of chart data through April 15, 2025)\n- Specific tariff rates mentioned:\n  - +25% on global autos\n  - +20% on China (later noted as +125% on China)\n  - +25% on Canada and Mexico non-USMCA\n  - +25% on steel and aluminum\n  - +10% tariff on most of the world\n\n### Market Performance (January 20, 2025 to May 1, 2025):\nThe article references a table showing asset performance but specific numbers are not fully extracted in the content provided.\n\n## Key Opinions from Named/Reliable Sources:\n\n**J.P. Morgan's Base Case Assumptions:**\n- Deals with trading partners and substitution effects could result in effective tariff rate settling at 10%-20%\n- This would impact U.S. growth, leading to higher unemployment and inflation, but likely avoiding a recession\n- Market volatility would persist, affecting earnings\n- U.S. will avoid a recession in 2025\n- In a no-recession environment, U.S. equities can still outperform rest of world into year-end\n\n**Michael Cembalest (Chairman of Asset & Wealth Management Investment Strategy, J.P. Morgan):**\n- Has been tracking tariff developments in his \"Trump Tracker\" and \"Eye on the Market: Dogespierre Has Left the Building\"\n\n## Context:\n- April 2025 marked \"one of the most volatile months for markets in recent memory\"\n- The article was written at the 100-day mark of President Trump's second term\n- Q1 2025 GDP data was distorted by tariff uncertainty, particularly from import front-loading in pharmaceuticals and computer parts\n- 2025 started with Wall Street consensus on \"U.S. exceptionalism\" but has shifted to \"except-U.S.-alism\"\n- J.P. Morgan advocates for portfolio diversification rather than avoiding U.S. assets entirely\n\n**Note:** The article content appears to be cut off mid-sentence at the end, so the final comparison between U.S.-only and global investor returns may be incomplete.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.tradingview.com/news/zacks:d3699eb3f094b:0-time-to-load-up-on-consumer-staples-etfs/\">\n# Article Summary: Consumer Staples ETFs Amid Market Volatility\n\n**Date:** February 17, 2026  \n**Source:** TradingView\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n### Market Performance (as of article date):\n- S&P 500 has fallen approximately 2% since the start of February 2026\n- CBOE Volatility Index has risen around 34% since the start of February 2026\n- CBOE Volatility Index has added about 23% over the past week\n- S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index has gained 9.97% over the past year\n- S&P 500 Consumer Staples Index has gained 15.58% year-to-date (2026)\n\n### Economic Indicators:\n\n**U.S. Debt Projections (Congressional Budget Office):**\n- Federal debt held by the public projected to climb to $56 trillion or 120% of GDP by 2036\n- Current debt level: approximately $31 trillion\n- Budget deficit projected to widen from $1.9 trillion in fiscal 2026 to $3.1 trillion by 2036\n\n**Consumer Confidence (Conference Board - January data):**\n- Consumer Confidence Index fell to 84.5 in January, down 9.7 points from December\n- Present Situation Index fell 9.9 points to 113.7 in January\n- Expectations Index dropped to 65.1 (below 80, which typically signals a recession ahead)\n\n**Consumer Sentiment (University of Michigan - February preliminary):**\n- Index of Consumer Sentiment rose 1.6% from January to 57.3 in February\n- Current Economic Conditions index climbed 5.2% to 58.3\n- Both measures remain down 11.4% year-over-year\n\n## Context:\nThe article discusses increased market volatility in early 2026 driven by geopolitical tensions, trade concerns, and an \"AI scare\" trade, recommending defensive positioning through consumer staples ETFs.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://sg.finance.yahoo.com/news/us-consumer-sentiment-rises-unexpectedly-075510957.html\">\n# Summary of Article: \"US consumer sentiment rises unexpectedly to a six-month high\"\n\n**Note:** The article title mentions consumer sentiment, but the content focuses primarily on stock market volatility and technology sector performance.\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- **Date of article:** February 6, 2026\n- **Market performance (as of 9:44 am New York time on Feb 6, 2026):**\n  - Nasdaq 100 Index: advanced 1%\n  - S&P 500 Index: advanced 1%\n  - **Cboe Volatility Index: hovering at around 20**\n  - The Nasdaq 100 was experiencing its biggest three-session decline since April (prior to this rebound)\n\n- **AI-related market impact:**\n  - A new AI automation tool from Anthropic sparked a $285 billion rout in stocks across software, financial services, and asset management sectors on Tuesday (Feb 3, 2026)\n  - Four of the biggest technology companies forecast combined capital expenditures of $650 billion in 2026 for data centers and related equipment\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n- **Clark Bellin (President and Chief Investment Officer at Bellwether Wealth):**\n  - Stocks are experiencing a volatile start to February\n  - Earnings season has not been enough to push stocks to new highs\n  - Earnings expectations have been very high, making it challenging for companies to meet them\n  - Advises investors to \"remain opportunistic when stocks dip, but not necessarily during every dip\"\n  - Expects 2026 \"should still be a positive year, with plenty of opportunities to buy stocks on sale\"\n\n- **Matt Maley (Miller Tabak):**\n  - Issues around software companies and AI industry profitability are not going to disappear\n  - Warns of \"meaningful risks to the tech sector going forward\" if tech stocks \"roll back over in a material way\" over the next week or two\n\n- **Russ Mould (Investment Director at AJ Bell):**\n  - The tech/AI slump could be part of a wider portfolio rebalancing\n  - Notes that panic can easily occur in widely-owned stocks that have performed well, especially where margin use is common and valuations are at a premium to wider markets\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve FRED VXVCLS daily data Jan 2024-Feb 2026 and summarize week-ahead changes\nThe CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index (series ID VXVCLS) is published by the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis on its FRED platform and is updated each trading day with the official Cboe close.  The series is expressed in index points, is not seasonally adjusted, and has a daily frequency.\n\n1. Coverage now available on FRED  \n   \u2022 Latest observation: 22.17 on 2026-02-13 (FRED VXVCLS \u201cObservations\u201d table, source 1).  \n   \u2022 Continuous daily history begins 2007-12-04 and extends through the present (FREDData extract, source 11).  \n\n2. What the original query requires  \n   \u2022 A complete list of daily closes from 2024-01-02 (the first trading day of that year) through 2026-02-14 (the last trading day in the week ending 2026-02-14).  \n   \u2022 A summary of \u201cweek-ahead changes,\u201d i.e., the difference between the index close on day t and the close five trading days later (t + 5).  This is normally expressed either in index points or as a percentage.  \n\n3. Information already retrieved  \n   \u2022 Spot values for early February 2026 and computed descriptive statistics over several fixed horizons (1-year mean 20.93, etc.; FREDData extract, source 11).  \n   \u2022 These snapshots confirm that the series is live and accessible through the API but they do not provide the full daily sequence needed for a January 2024\u2013February 2026 study.  \n   \u2022 No table or file in the search results contains the 500-plus daily observations spanning the requested interval, nor any pre-calculated week-ahead differences.\n\n4. Attempt to infer week-ahead behaviour with what is in hand  \n   The limited fragment (29 Jan 2026\u201313 Feb 2026) shows the following closes:  \n   19.67, 20.07, 19.37, 20.35, 20.62, 22.45, 20.37, 20.09, 20.43, 20.37, 22.17, 22.17 (sources 1, 11).  \n   Computing t + 5 changes inside this window gives only one complete five-day step (29 Jan \u279d 05 Feb: +2.78 pts, +14.1 %).  This single observation is not representative and cannot substitute for a systematic summary.\n\n5. Data still missing to fulfil the task  \n   \u2022 The entire daily time series from 2024-01-02 through 2026-02-14.  \n   \u2022 Once downloaded, each observation must be matched with the value five trading days later to create roughly 530 paired changes.  \n   \u2022 Aggregate statistics to report: mean, median, standard deviation, min, max, and perhaps percentiles of those week-ahead changes; counts of positive vs. negative moves; optionally the distribution by calendar year.\n\n6. Why additional data retrieval is essential  \n   FRED provides an unauthenticated endpoint for time-series observations:\n   https://api.stlouisfed.org/fred/series/observations?series_id=VXVCLS&observation_start=2024-01-01&observation_end=2026-02-28&api_key=YOUR_KEY&file_type=json  \n   This single call will deliver every close in the target window in a machine-readable format, after which the week-ahead calculations can be automated.  Without this file the requested summary cannot be produced.\n\nConclusion  \nThe search results confirm the availability and integrity of the VXVCLS series but do not contain the full set of daily observations required to compute week-ahead changes from January 2024 through February 2026.  Accessing the FRED API for the specified date range is therefore still necessary.  Once the complete dataset is downloaded, straightforward processing (shift by five trading days and difference) will yield the week-ahead series, from which descriptive statistics and any higher-level summary can be prepared.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"VXVCLS\" query=\"VXVCLS\">\nFRED Economic Data: CBOE S&P 500 3-Month Volatility Index\nSeries ID: VXVCLS\nUnits: Index\nFrequency: Daily, Close\nLatest observation: 22.17 (2026-02-13)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=20.93, min=17.72, max=41.50\n- 5-year: mean=21.38, min=13.95, max=41.50\n- 10-year: mean=20.42, min=11.85, max=72.98\n- All-time: mean=21.62, min=11.85, max=72.98 (since 2007-12-04)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: +2.80 (+14.5%)\n- 3-month change: +0.59 (+2.7%)\n- 6-month change: +3.53 (+18.9%)\n- Year-over-year: 22.17 vs 17.84 (+24.3%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily, Close):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-29,19.67\n2026-01-30,20.07\n2026-02-02,19.37\n2026-02-03,20.35\n2026-02-04,20.62\n2026-02-05,22.45\n2026-02-06,20.37\n2026-02-09,20.09\n2026-02-10,20.43\n2026-02-11,20.37\n2026-02-12,22.17\n2026-02-13,22.17\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
