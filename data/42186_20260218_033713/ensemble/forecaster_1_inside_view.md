Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **FRED trend data:** Series declined from 5.03% (Feb 4) to 4.85% (Feb 16), showing clear 12bp downward momentum over 12 days. This is primary source data with established directional trend.
- **Multiple sources confirming Treasury rally:** Nuveen (16bp weekly decline to 4.05%), Penn Mutual (10-15bp rally), both dated Feb 17. Independent confirmation of flight-to-quality dynamics.
- **Fed policy stability:** Fed held at 3.50-3.75% (Jan 28 FOMC), market pricing two H2-26 cuts. This creates dovish backdrop supporting lower yields.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Credit spread tightness:** OAS at 0.94% (Feb 16), near cycle lows. Single source but consistent with tight spread environment limiting absolute yield upside.
- **Supply pressure from AI financing:** Dallas Fed and BofA Hartnett both cite $170-300B in tech issuance. Two independent expert sources, but impact timing uncertain over 8-day window.
- **Recent economic data:** Softer retail sales, weaker housing, cooler CPI (Penn Mutual). Single recent source but aligns with Treasury rally narrative.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Mean reversion potential:** 1-year average 5.13% suggests 28bp upside, but short 8-day timeframe limits relevance.
- **Profit-taking risk:** At 1-year lows (4.85%), but no specific catalyst identified.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 8 calendar days (6 trading days) from Feb 18 to Feb 26, 2026.

**If timeframe halved (3 trading days):** Would increase confidence in continuation of current downward trend. Recent momentum shows 8bp decline over 6 trading days (Feb 10-16), suggesting 4-5bp further decline possible. Distribution would narrow significantly around 4.80-4.85%.

**If timeframe doubled (12 trading days):** Would need to incorporate higher probability of mean reversion, data surprises, and supply impact from tech issuance. Distribution would widen substantially, with 10th percentile potentially reaching 4.60% and 90th percentile extending to 5.15%.

**Current 6-trading-day window:** Balanced between momentum continuation and event risk. Recent 6-day periods showed 5-8bp declines, but at 1-year lows, reversal risk increases.

## (d) Justification

**Factors supporting continued decline/stability (4.75-4.85% range):**
1. **Momentum:** 12bp decline over 12 days with accelerating pace (8bp in last 6 days)
2. **Dovish Fed expectations:** Two H2-26 cuts priced, creating tailwind for duration assets
3. **Flight-to-quality:** Multiple sources confirm risk-off dynamics supporting high-grade credit
4. **Tight spreads:** OAS at 0.94% limits absolute yield upside
5. **Soft economic data:** Recent retail sales, housing, CPI all weaker than expected

**Factors supporting reversal/rise (4.90-5.10% range):**
1. **Supply pressure:** $170-300B tech issuance could pressure spreads wider and absolute yields higher
2. **Technical exhaustion:** At 1-year lows (4.85%), vulnerable to profit-taking
3. **Upcoming data risk:** Week of Feb 17-21 includes Q4 GDP, PCE inflation that could surprise
4. **Spread widening:** MarketMinute reports 2-5bp IG spread widening, tech spreads up 20bp

**Distribution shift justification:**
The outside view base rate centered around 4.81% (40th percentile) with 10th at 4.68% and 90th at 5.04%. Current evidence supports:
- **Narrowing downside tail:** Flight-to-quality and momentum suggest limited further decline beyond 4.70%
- **Maintaining upside tail:** Supply pressure and mean reversion risk justify keeping 90th percentile around 5.00%
- **Shifting median slightly lower:** Strong recent momentum and dovish backdrop warrant moving median from 4.84% to 4.82%

The reference class remains valid but current momentum is stronger than typical, justifying modest downward shift in central tendency while maintaining wide tails for uncertainty.

## Distribution Calibration

**Current value:** 4.85% (Feb 16, 2026)
**Days to resolution:** 8 calendar days (6 trading days)

**Central scenario (40th-60th percentiles):** Given strong downward momentum (12bp over 12 days) but recognition of 1-year lows creating reversal risk, central range should be 4.78-4.87%. This reflects:
- Continuation of recent trend would suggest 4.77-4.80% (4-8bp further decline)
- Status quo/stability suggests 4.85%
- Slight mean reversion suggests 4.87-4.90%

**Downside tail (10th percentile):** Flight-to-quality acceleration or very soft data could push to Dec 2025 lows around 4.70%. Setting 10th at 4.70%.

**Upside tail (90th percentile):** Supply shock from tech issuance, data surprise, or profit-taking could push back toward early Feb levels of 4.95-5.00%. Setting 90th at 5.00%.

**Calibration adjustments:**
- 20th percentile: Modest further decline to 4.76%
- 40th percentile: Slight decline to 4.80%
- 60th percentile: Near-stability at 4.86%
- 80th percentile: Modest reversal to 4.94%

**Testing ±10% shifts:**
- Moving 60th from 4.86% to 4.76% would be too bearish given reversal risk at 1-year lows
- Moving 60th from 4.86% to 4.95% would ignore strong recent momentum
- Current calibration appropriately balances trend continuation with mean reversion risk

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** ICE BofA 7-10 Year US Corporate Index Effective Yield on Feb 26, 2026, in percent. ✓ Analysis aligns exactly.

2. **Outside view base rate:** 10th: 4.68%, Median: ~4.84%, 90th: 5.04%. My final prediction shifts median down to 4.83% based on strong momentum evidence while maintaining similar tail widths. ✓ Rooted in base rate with justified adjustments.

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median = 4.83%; mean ≈ 4.83%. This makes sense given strong downward momentum but reversal risk at 1-year lows. ✓ Aligned with justification.

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence:**
   - 12bp decline over 12 days in primary FRED data (factually verified)
   - Multiple sources confirm 10-16bp Treasury rally and flight-to-quality (Nuveen, Penn Mutual - verified)
   - Fed on hold with two H2-26 cuts priced (FOMC statement verified)
   - $170B+ tech bond issuance creating supply pressure (BofA, Dallas Fed - verified)
   - OAS at 0.94%, near cycle lows (TradingView - verified)

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Unexpected hawkish Fed communication or significantly stronger-than-expected economic data (GDP, PCE) could trigger sharp reversal to 5.05-5.15%. This would push outcome UP.

6. **Status quo outcome:** Current value 4.85%. Given strong momentum but 1-year lows, slight nudge toward stability (4.85%) vs. continued decline is appropriate. My 60th percentile at 4.86% reflects this. ✓

7. **Technicalities:** Values strictly increasing ✓, units in Percent ✓, within bounds (4.068015 to 6.4745) ✓
