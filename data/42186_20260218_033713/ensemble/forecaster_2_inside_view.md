**Key Factual Observations:**
- Last print: 4.89% (Feb 12, 2026)
- 10-yr Treasury: 4.05% (down 16bp weekly per Nuveen)
- Recent trend: Yields declining (Treasuries rallying)
- Credit spreads: Tight but showing signs of widening (2-5bp IG, per MarketMinute)
- Heavy corporate issuance: $100B+ tech debt in early 2026
- No FOMC meeting in forecast window

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Treasury rally momentum**: Multiple sources (Nuveen, Penn Mutual) confirm 10-yr Treasury dropped 16bp in week ending Feb 13. This typically pulls corporate yields lower. Corporate yields lag/follow Treasury moves with credit spread adjustments.
- **Last observed value**: 4.89% on Feb 12, down from recent levels (4.95%+ in late Jan per historical context).

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Credit spread stability/slight widening**: MarketMinute reports 2-5bp IG spread widening; BofA notes spreads remain "tight." OAS at 0.94% is historically compressed. Modest widening pressure from heavy issuance, but no crisis signal.
- **No major catalysts in 8-day window**: No FOMC meeting, no major scheduled data releases likely to cause >15bp moves.
- **Expert forecasts**: Nuveen expects 10-yr Treasury range-bound at 4.00-4.25%, implying stability. JPMorgan/BofA longer-term forecasts suggest gradual spread widening but not imminent shock.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Seasonal/technical factors**: Month-end approaching (Feb 26), but no clear directional bias.
- **Volatility environment**: MOVE index historically low (though data from Dec 2025), suggesting calm conditions.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

Forecast window: 8 calendar days (Feb 18-26), approximately 6 trading days.

**If halved (3 trading days):** Distribution would narrow significantly. σ would scale by √(3/6) ≈ 0.71, implying ~7bp standard deviation. Percentile ranges would compress to roughly ±14bp (10th/90th) from current anchor.

**If doubled (12 trading days):** Distribution would widen. σ would scale by √(12/6) ≈ 1.41, implying ~14bp standard deviation. Percentile ranges would expand to roughly ±28bp (10th/90th). Greater chance of encountering macro surprises or Fed communication.

Current 6-day window is short enough that structural factors dominate over new information shocks, but long enough for technical adjustments and modest spread/rate moves.

**(d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View:**

**Downward bias factors:**
1. **Recent Treasury rally**: 16bp drop in 10-yr Treasury (week ending Feb 13) creates downward pull on corporate yields. If this momentum persists even partially into the next week, it argues for lower yields.
2. **Last print trending down**: 4.89% (Feb 12) is below the 4.95%+ levels from late January. Short-term momentum is downward.
3. **Stable/benign macro backdrop**: Nuveen notes core inflation at 2.5% (below expectations), unemployment at 4.3%. No imminent hawkish Fed shift.

**Upward bias factors:**
1. **Heavy corporate issuance**: $100B+ tech debt supply in early 2026 creates modest upward pressure on yields via spread widening. MarketMinute reports 2-5bp IG spread widening already.
2. **Spreads historically tight**: At 0.94% OAS, spreads have limited room to compress further. More likely to widen modestly than tighten.

**Net assessment:** The recent Treasury rally and downward momentum in the last print (4.89% vs. 4.95%+ prior) are strong near-term factors. However, heavy issuance and tight spreads provide modest upward pressure. The outside view anchor of 4.85% (based on historical mean-reversion) is slightly below the last print of 4.89%. Given the 6-day window and recent downward momentum, I shift the distribution center slightly downward to 4.87% (splitting the difference between outside view 4.85% and last print 4.89%). This reflects:
- Modest continuation of Treasury rally (partial, not full 16bp)
- Slight spread widening offset (2-3bp)
- Short timeframe limiting large moves

The outside view σ≈10bp remains appropriate given the calm volatility environment and absence of major catalysts. I widen the tails slightly (10th: 4.67% → 4.66%; 90th: 5.05% → 5.08%) to account for tail risks (geopolitical shock, surprise data), but keep the distribution relatively tight given the short window.

**Distribution Calibration:**

Center: 4.87% (vs. outside view 4.85%, last print 4.89%)
σ: ~10bp (unchanged from outside view)

- **10th percentile** (~-2.1σ): 4.87 - 0.21 = 4.66%
- **20th percentile** (~-1.2σ): 4.87 - 0.12 = 4.75%
- **40th percentile** (~-0.3σ): 4.87 - 0.03 = 4.84%
- **60th percentile** (~+0.3σ): 4.87 + 0.03 = 4.90%
- **80th percentile** (~+1.1σ): 4.87 + 0.11 = 4.98%
- **90th percentile** (~+2.1σ): 4.87 + 0.21 = 5.08%

**Checklist:**

1. **Target variable**: ICE BofA 7-10 Year US Corporate Index Effective Yield on Feb 26, 2026, in percent. ✓

2. **Outside view base rate**: Centered at 4.85%, σ≈10bp, 10th: 4.65%, 90th: 5.05%. My forecast shifts center to 4.87% (last print 4.89%, recent downward momentum) and widens 90th to 5.08% for tail risk. Rooted in base rate with modest adjustments. ✓

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median ≈ 4.87%; mean ≈ 4.87%. Aligns with recent print (4.89%) and downward momentum from Treasury rally. Sensible. ✓

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - 10-yr Treasury dropped 16bp week ending Feb 13 (strong, factual, multiple sources)
   - Last print 4.89% trending down from 4.95%+ (strong, factual)
   - Heavy tech issuance $100B+ causing 2-5bp spread widening (moderate, factual)
   - Credit spreads tight at 0.94% OAS, limited compression room (moderate, factual)
   - No FOMC meeting in window (strong, factual)
   All verified as factual. ✓

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Surprise hawkish Fed communication (e.g., Powell speech) or geopolitical shock (e.g., trade war escalation) could push yields sharply higher (+20-30bp), making my forecast look too narrow/low. Would push outcome UP.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Last print 4.89%. Given short 6-day window and modest volatility, status quo is plausible. My median 4.87% is very close (2bp lower), reflecting slight downward momentum but not aggressive extrapolation. Appropriate. ✓

7. **Technicalities**: Percentiles strictly increasing: 4.66 < 4.75 < 4.84 < 4.90 < 4.98 < 5.08. Units in percent. All within bounds [4.068, 6.475]. ✓
