Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**FRED Data (Primary Source - 2026-02-16)**
High-quality official data showing the series at 4.85% on Feb 16, with a clear declining trend from 4.96% (Feb 11) to 4.85% (Feb 16). This is the most reliable source as it's the actual data series being forecasted. The data shows:
- Recent range: 4.85-5.03% (past 2 weeks)
- 1-month decline: -0.11% (-2.2%)
- Historical context: Current level is lowest since August 2025

**Agent Report (2026-02-18)**
Comprehensive analysis synthesizing multiple data points. Key factual observations:
- Latest reading: 4.85% (Feb 16)
- One-month decline: ~12 bp from 4.97% (Jan 15)
- Investment-grade OAS tightened 6 bp in January (CI SBH source)
- Fed funds rate unchanged at 3.50-3.75% (Jan 28 FOMC)
- Market expects two quarter-point cuts in H2-26

Expert opinion from Fed officials (John Williams): Policy "closer to neutral," inflation should "peak in H1-26."

**Dallas Fed Article (2026-02-10)**
Discusses AI-related corporate bond issuance impact. Key facts:
- $300 billion AI-related IG issuance estimated for 2026
- $360 billion in 10-year equivalents of new duration supply
- This represents 1/8 of Treasury duration supply

Opinion/Analysis: Duration supply should bias yields higher and curves steeper. However, this is forward-looking analysis about supply pressures, not current market conditions.

**U.S. Bank Article (appears 2026, misdated 2021)**
Contains current market commentary. Key facts:
- 10-year Treasuries in 4.00%-4.25% range since August
- Fed reduced rates at last three 2025 meetings
- Current fed funds: 3.50%-3.75%
- Median Fed projection: one 2026 cut; investors expect two

Expert opinion (Bill Merz): "Recently, rate cuts pulled Treasury yields lower" and "Economic conditions can support continued earnings growth."

**Penn Mutual Article (2026-02-17)**
Recent market commentary. Key facts:
- Treasury yields rallied 10-15 bp lower across curve
- Softer retail sales, weaker housing data, cooler CPI
- Unemployment: 4.3%
- Flight to quality into Treasuries

Market sentiment: "Sell first" mindset, AI concerns undermining confidence.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Recent 1-2 week volatility (Most Suitable)**
- Past 2 weeks: 4.85-5.03% (18 bp range)
- Past month: 4.85-5.05% (20 bp range)
- Highly relevant given 8-day forecast horizon
- Current trend: declining (-11 bp over 5 days)

**Reference Class 2: Typical daily/weekly movements**
- Historical data shows daily moves typically <10 bp
- Largest recent single-day move: -7 bp (Feb 11)
- Over 8 trading days, cumulative moves could be ±15-25 bp

**Reference Class 3: Monthly volatility patterns**
- 1-month historical change: -0.11% (recent)
- 3-month change: -0.13%
- 6-month change: -0.24%
- Suggests modest downward drift but with bounded volatility

**Selected Reference Class:** Recent 1-2 week volatility combined with typical daily movement patterns is most suitable given the 8-day forecast horizon.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 8 calendar days (6 trading days from Feb 18 to Feb 26)

**Historical Patterns Over Similar Periods:**
- Recent 6-trading-day periods show moves of 5-15 bp
- Feb 10-16 (5 trading days): -8 bp decline (4.93→4.85)
- Feb 4-10 (4 trading days): -10 bp decline (5.03→4.93)
- Current momentum: downward

**Key Observations:**
1. Series rarely moves >10 bp in a single day
2. Over 6 trading days, cumulative moves of 15-20 bp are plausible
3. Current level (4.85%) is at recent lows (lowest since August 2025)
4. Mean reversion vs. momentum: tight spreads and flight-to-quality suggest continuation of low yields, but some bounce-back is possible

## (d) Justification

**Outside View Prediction Rationale:**

The 7-10 year corporate yield currently sits at 4.85%, having declined 11 bp over the past month. Several factors inform the 8-day forecast:

**Downward Pressures:**
1. Spreads at cycle tights (6 bp tightening in January) with continued strong demand
2. Flight-to-quality dynamics ongoing (per Penn Mutual)
3. Fed maintaining accommodative stance (3.50-3.75% funds rate)
4. Softer economic data (retail, housing, CPI) supporting lower yields
5. Recent momentum clearly downward (-11 bp in 5 days)

**Upward Pressures:**
1. Current level (4.85%) is at technical support (August 2025 lows around 4.76%)
2. Potential for mean reversion after sharp recent decline
3. AI-related corporate issuance ($300B in 2026) adds duration supply pressure
4. 10-year Treasury range-bound at 4.00-4.25%, limiting downside

**Most Likely Scenario:** Continuation of recent trend with modest further decline or stabilization in 4.75-4.95% range. The series is unlikely to break significantly below 4.76% (recent historical low) or rally back above 5.00% in just 6 trading days without major macro catalyst.

**Tail Risks:**
- Downside: Unexpected dovish Fed communication or sharp economic deterioration could push toward 4.65-4.70%
- Upside: Credit event, sudden risk-off in corporates, or hawkish surprise could push toward 5.05-5.15%

Outside view calibration:

Given the 8-day forecast horizon and recent volatility patterns:

1. **Central tendency:** The most likely outcome clusters around 4.80-4.90%, reflecting modest continuation of the recent downtrend or stabilization near current levels.

2. **Distribution shape:** Should be slightly skewed toward lower values given momentum and tight spreads, but with meaningful probability mass above current levels due to mean reversion potential.

3. **Tail considerations:**
   - 10th percentile: Must account for continued flight-to-quality and spread tightening. Recent low was 4.76%, so 4.68% represents roughly 2 standard deviations of daily moves compounded over 6 days.
   - 90th percentile: Must account for potential reversal or risk-off event. Recent high was 5.03% (Feb 4), so 5.08% represents a full reversal plus modest overshoot.

4. **Historical upset rate:** Corporate yield indices show relatively smooth behavior with rare >20 bp weekly moves. Given current low volatility environment and tight spreads, extreme outcomes are less likely but not impossible.

5. **Calibration to bounds:** The question provides bounds of 4.068-6.475%, which are very wide. My distribution should reflect realistic 8-day movement potential, not these extreme bounds.
