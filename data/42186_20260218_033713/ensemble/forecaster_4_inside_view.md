Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED series BAMLC4A0C710YEY (updated through 16 Feb 2026, last print ≈ 4.85 %) – primary, high-quality factual source.  
2. Nuveen Weekly Fixed-Income Commentary (17 Feb 2026) – reputable asset-manager note; gives current Treasury levels (10-y = 4.05 %) and near-term outlook; moderate evidence.  
3. MarketMinute article (12 Feb 2026) on $100 bn tech issuance – factual new-supply data, plus opinion that spreads will stay volatile; moderate evidence.  
4. SIFMA statistics (4 Feb 2026) – factual YTD issuance totals; weak for 8-day horizon.  
5. Phoenix/BoFA Hartnett note (17 Feb 2026) – strategist opinion that heavy AI cap-ex is pressuring credit; speculative for 1-week view; weak evidence.  
6. Historical 1- and 5-year distribution stats for the index – high-quality descriptive data.  

(b) Evidence analysis (strength vs. outside view)  
Strong: none that directly forces a large 8-day move.  
Moderate:  
• Treasury rally to 4.05 % (Nuveen) – lowers corporate yields baseline.  
• Heavy Feb issuance (MarketMinute) – has widened IG spreads 2-5 bp; pushes yields slightly up vs. Treasuries.  
Weak: strategist warnings (Hartnett), YTD issuance totals (SIFMA).

Net moderate evidence roughly offsets: lower Treasuries vs. slightly wider spreads → index sits near 4.8–4.9 %.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon: 8 calendar days (≈ 6 trading days).  
If horizon were halved (3 trading days) I would narrow the 10th–90th band by ~25 %.  
If doubled (12 trading days) I would widen the band by ~20 %.

(d) Justification / adjustment from outside view  
Outside-view median (random-walk around last print) = ≈ 4.90 %.  
Inside view:  
• Little scheduled macro able to shock rates before 26 Feb; MOVE index is low.  
• Post-flood issuance likely pauses, allowing spreads to drift sideways/down.  
• Treasury yields prone to small rebound after 16 bp drop.  
These partially cancel, so I keep the median near 4.90 % and retain a ±0.25–0.30 % 80 %-range to hedge against surprises (e.g., hot PCE, risk-off geopolitical shock).

Distribution calibration
10th: 4.68 % – requires another ~-17 bp in 6 days (two-sigma continuation of recent rally).  
20th: 4.75 %  
40th: 4.85 %  
60th: 4.95 %  
80th: 5.07 %  
90th: 5.20 % – implies ~+35 bp jump (major data or risk shock).

Checklist:
1. Target: ICE BofA 7-10 Year US Corporate Index Effective Yield (%) on 26 Feb 2026. ✔  
2. Outside-view distribution centred on last print 4.85–4.90 % ✔  
3. Consistency: median ≈ 4.90 %; mean slightly above because of mild right tail; plausible. ✔  
4. Key evidence: a) 10-y Treasury 4.05 % (Nuveen); b) heavy tech issuance widening IG spreads 2-5 bp; c) recent 15-20 bp weekly drop already realised; d) low MOVE volatility.  
5. Blind-spot: surprise CPI/PCE re-acceleration on 23 Feb sending 10-y back above 4.30 % (would push outcome above my 90th).  
6. Status-quo bias checked – distribution still clustered near current level. ✔  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, correct units, within plausible bounds. ✔
