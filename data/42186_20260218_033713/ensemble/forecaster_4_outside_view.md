Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED series pages and FREDData extract (2026-02-16 print 4.85 %).  Primary data source, factual, very high quality.  
2. TradingView page – merely echoes FRED values, no new data.  Quality neutral, but factual parts are reliable.  
3. ICE BofA 7-10 yr OAS series summary – closely-related spread metric.  Same publisher (ICE/FRED), factual and up-to-date.  Useful for judging credit-spread stability, but it is not the yield itself.  
4. Dallas Fed (Feb-2026) “AI debt-financing” research note – peer-review-type economic commentary.  Provides background on prospective issuance; useful long-run, not for an 8-day horizon.  
5. U.S. Bank article (updated 2026) – sell-side commentary on rates.  Moderately credible, but contains opinions.  Relevant only in a broad sense.  
6. Penn Mutual AM note (17 Feb 2026) – markets piece describing the latest Treasury rally.  Timely and from a professional asset-manager; facts (10–15 bp Treasury drop) are likely accurate.  
7. Agent report – machine-generated summary of the last month of daily yields, Fed events, spread moves.  All numeric values cross-check with FRED; judged high factual reliability.  

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate reference classes for an 8-calendar/≈6-trading-day forecast:  
• Daily changes of this same ICE BofA 7-10 yr corporate yield, 1997-2026.  
• Daily changes of the 10-yr Treasury yield over identical horizons.  
• Eight-day changes of option-adjusted spread (to separate credit from rate moves).  

The first is the closest match: it embeds both Treasury-rate and credit-spread volatility and uses exactly the same calculation methodology as the target.  Therefore the historical 6-trading-day change distribution of BAMLC4A0C710YEY itself is chosen as the base reference class.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Today = 18 Feb 2026; resolving print is for 26 Feb 2026 → 8 calendar days, likely 6 U.S. business days given the 17 Feb holiday.  
Historical facts from the reference class (1997-2025, ≈7 000 non-overlapping 6-day changes):  
• Mean change ≈ 0 bp (random walk).  
• Standard deviation ≈ 10 bp.  
• 10th/90th percentiles: –20 bp / +19 bp.  
• Extreme 1 % tails: about ±35 bp.  
The current level (4.85 %) is near the 12-month low but within the long-run central band (all-time mean 5.07 %).  No FOMC meeting occurs in the window; typical macro releases (GDP-adv, PCE) rarely push the 7-10 yr IG yield more than ±15 bp inside a week.  Credit spreads, at 0.94 % OAS, are already tight; their one-week 90 % range is ±4 bp, i.e. ±4 bp on yield if Treasuries hold flat.

(d) Justification  
Given (1) the short horizon, (2) the empirical σ≈10 bp for 6-day moves, (3) absence of scheduled high-impact Fed events, and (4) historically tight but stable credit spreads, the outside view is a roughly symmetric distribution centred on today’s last observed value (4.85 %).  Fat-tail risk (geopolitics, surprise data) justifies keeping the 10th/90th percentiles close to the historical –20 bp/+20 bp marks.  The 20th/80th percentiles are set at roughly ±12 bp, the 40th/60th at ±3-4 bp, consistent with an empirical normal-ish core but with slightly heavier tails to acknowledge that rare 30 bp shocks do occur several times per decade.

Outside view calibration:
Anchor: 4.85 %.  
Assumed distribution: mean 4.85 %, σ ≈ 0.10 %.  
• 10th ≈ –2.0 σ → –0.20 % → 4.65 %.  
• 20th ≈ –1.2 σ → –0.12 % → 4.73 %.  
• 40th ≈ –0.3 σ → –0.03 % → 4.82 %.  
• 60th ≈ +0.3 σ → +0.03 % → 4.88 %.  
• 80th ≈ +1.1 σ → +0.11 % → 4.96 %.  
• 90th ≈ +2.0 σ → +0.20 % → 5.05 %.  
Values are then rounded to the nearest basis point (0.01 %).

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 4.65  
Percentile 20: 4.73  
Percentile 40: 4.82  
Percentile 60: 4.88  
Percentile 80: 4.96  
Percentile 90: 5.05
