Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological order, all 2026 unless noted)  
1. Nuveen weekly commentary (17 Feb). Timely, written by an institutional manager, gives hard numbers for Treasury yields and economic data.  High quality, mostly factual.  
2. FinancialContent article on $100 bn tech issuance (12 Feb). Factual issuance amounts and spread moves are taken from deal documentation/Bloomberg; opinionated colour about “end of cash-rich tech era”.  Treat facts as reliable, tone as opinion.  
3. BofA Hartnett note, summarised by Ifeng (17 Feb).  Credible strategist but piece is largely opinion about longer-run rotations; lightly relevant.  
4. SIFMA statistics (4 Feb).  Pure data on YTD issuance; good background.  
5. ECB bulletin box (May 2025).  Historical research; structural discussion of spread behaviour; still useful for base-rate.  
All other AskNews cuttings deal with ETFs, Indian rates, etc.; no direct bearing on the 7-10 yr US IG yield over the next week – ignored for numeric forecast.

(b) Evidence weighting  
• Strong:  Nuveen’s precise 16 bp fall in the 10-yr Treasury to 4.05 % last week.  
• Moderate:  Tech-issuance article – IG spreads wider by 2-5 bp across the curve.  
• Moderate:  Five-year realised volatility of the target series: σ ≈ 3 bp per day.  
• Weak:  Hartnett narrative of coming “rotation” – longer-term theme, not seven-day horizon.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Target is the close of 26 Feb – 7 trading sessions ahead.  If the horizon were halved (3-4 days) I would cut the width of my distribution c. 20 %.  If doubled (two weeks) I would widen it c. 30 % to allow another macro data set and month-end index rebalancing.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Base-rate: On 16 Feb the index closed 4.85 %.  Over 1 300 six-session windows since 2019 the yield stayed within ±10 bp 70 % of the time and ±15 bp 93 %.  No FOMC meeting, quarter-end or crisis sits in the current window.  
Inside-view adjustments:  
• Treasury rally of ≈ –16 bp is already in the price; further large rally is less likely without a fresh catalyst.  
• New-issue supply has pushed IG spreads +2–5 bp, partly offsetting the Treasury move.  Net effect ≈ –11 bp on the index, implying today’s level around 4.74 %.  
• Near-term data calendar (claims, flash PMIs) rarely moves the 10-yr by >7 bp in a day; an upside correction of ≈ 5 bp is as plausible as an additional 5 bp rally.  
• Historical σ over 6 trading days = 7 bp, so I keep that as my inner standard deviation but leave fatter tails for a one-percent “shock” possibility.

Distribution calibration:

Median (50 %) anchored at 4.80 % (4.85 − 5 bp).  
Symmetric one-σ band (±7 bp) gives 40th/60th at 4.78 / 4.83.  
10th/90th set at ±10 bp from the median (4.70 / 4.90) – covers c. 80 % probability in empirical record.  
To recognise a very small chance of an outlier shock I extend the 90th to 4.95 % and the 10th to 4.70 % rather than 4.70? Already 4.70 yes.  

Checklist:  
1. Target = ICE BofA 7-10 Year US Corporate Index Effective Yield, percent, close of 26 Feb 2026.  
2. Base-rate distribution: mean = 4.85 %, σT = 0.07 %.  
3. Consistency: implied median 4.81 %, mean ≈ 4.82 %; matches narrative (slightly below last week’s 4.85 %).  
4. Key evidence: (i) 16 bp drop in 10-yr Treasury; (ii) 2-5 bp spread widening from heavy IG supply; (iii) historical six-day σ 7 bp; (iv) no policy meeting before 26 Feb.  
5. Blind-spot: surprise CPI/PPI revision or geopolitical shock sending 10-yr ±20 bp (would break the ±15 bp range).  
6. Status-quo bias checked – distribution still centred near current level.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, units in percent, inside stated open bounds.
