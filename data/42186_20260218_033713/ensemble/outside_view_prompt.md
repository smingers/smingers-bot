# Summary of Article

**Article Type:** FRED Data Series Page

**Series:** ICE BofA 7-10 Year US Corporate Index Option-Adjusted Spread (BAMLC4A0C710Y)

## Key Facts and Statistics:

**Recent Observations (Option-Adjusted Spread):**
- 2026-02-16: 0.94%
- 2026-02-13: 0.94%
- 2026-02-12: 0.92%
- 2026-02-11: 0.91%
- 2026-02-10: 0.92%

**Series Characteristics:**
- Units: Percent
- Frequency: Daily, Close
- Seasonal Adjustment: Not Seasonally Adjusted

## Important Context:

**What This Series Measures:**
This series tracks the Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) - the calculated spread between a computed OAS index of all bonds in the 7-10 year maturity category and a spot Treasury curve. The OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization.

This is a subset of the ICE BofA US Corporate Master OAS (BAMLC0A0CM), including only securities with remaining term to maturity of greater than or equal to 7 years and less than 10 years.

**Note on Weekend Data:** When the last calendar day of the month falls on a weekend, weekend observations will occur due to month-ending accrued interest adjustments.

---

**Disclaimer:** This article provides data on the Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) series, which is a different but related metric to the Effective Yield series (BAMLC4A0C710YEY) that is the subject of the forecasting question. The OAS measures the spread over Treasury rates, while the effective yield is the absolute yield level. Both metrics track the same universe of 7-10 year corporate bonds.

# Summary of "How AI debt financing impacts duration supply and interest rates"

**Source:** Dallas Fed

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Scale of AI Investment:**
   - Estimated $3-5 trillion investment in AI data centers over the next 3-5 years
   - Approximately $500-600 billion invested to date since 2023, primarily from hyperscalers' retained earnings

2. **AI-Related Corporate Bond Issuance:**
   - Wall Street estimates center on **$300 billion in AI-related investment grade issuance for 2026**
   - This could result in **$360 billion in 10-year equivalents of new duration supply** over 2026
   - This represents about **one-eighth of the duration supply from U.S. Treasury issuance**

3. **Synthetic Duration Supply:**
   - Anecdotal evidence from market participants suggests synthetic duration supply (via pay-fixed swaps paired with floating-rate private credit borrowing) may have totaled **$50 billion or more in 10-year equivalents** in Q4 2025

## Key Observations:

- **Issuance Characteristics:** Recent AI-related corporate bond issuance has been both large and concentrated in long maturities, reflecting the long-lived nature of data center assets
- **Financing Preference:** Data center operators prefer fixed-rate financing to lower income volatility, as underlying economics don't vary with interest rates over business cycles

## Three Channels of Duration Supply Impact:

1. **Direct effects:** Large-scale long-duration corporate bond issuance
2. **Synthetic duration supply:** Pay-fixed swaps paired with floating-rate private credit borrowing
3. **Substitution effects:** Potential crowding out of financial firm issuance, which typically removes duration from markets through receive-fixed swaps

## Market Evidence (from Dallas Fed analysis):

The article presents empirical evidence (Chart 5) showing:
- The 10-year-to-30-year Treasury curve slope has become increasingly sensitive to 10-year term premium measures
- The sensitivity of 30-year asset swap spreads to term premium has declined or risen only modestly
- This divergence is "indicative" of synthetic duration supply from AI financing

## Implications:

- Duration supply should bias yield levels higher and the yield curve steeper
- Synthetic duration supply should bias Treasuries richer versus swaps (unlike actual Treasury issuance which would cheapen Treasuries relative to swaps)

**Note:** This is analysis and opinion from Dallas Fed economists, not a forecast of specific yield values.

# Summary of "How Changing Interest Rates Affect Bonds" (U.S. Bank, July 7, 2021)

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Current Treasury Yield Range**: 10-year U.S. Treasuries holding near a 4.00%-4.25% range since August (context: article appears to discuss 2025-2026 timeframe despite 2021 date)

2. **Yield Curve**: The 10-year Treasury yields 0.70% more than the 2-year Treasury, compared with an average spread of nearly 0.80% since 1977

3. **Federal Reserve Policy**: 
   - Fed reduced interest rates at their last three meetings of 2025
   - Current federal funds target rate: 3.50% to 3.75% (as of January meeting mentioned)
   - Median Fed member projections anticipate one 2026 cut
   - Investors expect two additional cuts (creating a gap in expectations)

4. **Fiscal Policy**: The "One Big Beautiful Bill Act" could increase federal debt by $3.4 trillion by 2034 according to Congressional Budget Office estimates

5. **Treasury Issuance**: Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent does not plan to increase auction sizes for longer maturities; instead will issue more short-term bills

## Named Source Opinions:

**Bill Merz, Head of Capital Markets Research, U.S. Bank Asset Management Group:**
- "Federal Reserve (Fed) rate cuts pulled short-term bond yields lower. However, longer-term bond yields remained rangebound in recent months due to lower inflation expectations offsetting stronger economic growth expectations."
- "Economists predicted modestly higher inflation this year, and recent data confirmed those forecasts. Consensus now points to a gradual slowdown in inflation. Tariff price pressures appeared in business surveys and accelerating core goods prices, but these effects haven't been extreme."
- "Recently, rate cuts pulled Treasury yields lower. Over the long run, bond buyers want to see federal cash flow support bond principal and interest payments, which would suggest lower spending or higher taxes."
- "Economic conditions can support continued earnings growth, creating favorable equity and real asset return opportunities."

## Key Market Dynamics:

- Short-term yields are primarily influenced by central bank policy and rate expectations
- Longer-term yields respond more to economic growth and inflation expectations
- Credit quality shapes extra yield demanded outside Treasury market
- Bond supply (borrowing needs) influences all bonds
- Inflation remains above Fed's target, which can affect pace of future rate cuts and how far longer-term yields can fall
- Large tariff increases instituted in 2025 could partially offset additional spending if maintained in 2026 and beyond

Summary of movements since 2026-01-15
1. Direction: The yield fell from roughly 4.97 % (2026-01-15) to 4.85 % (2026-02-16), a decline of about 12 bp (-2.4 %).  
2. Pace: The drop was orderly rather than abrupt. The index hovered just above 5 % from mid-January through 2026-02-04, then ground lower in two mini-legs:
   • 2026-02-05 to 2026-02-10: -9 bp in four trading days as Treasury yields eased after soft CPI import-price data.  
   • 2026-02-12 to 2026-02-16: another -4 bp, coinciding with renewed demand for intermediate-grade corporate issuance.  
3. Volatility: The largest single-day move in the period was -7 bp on 2026-02-11 (5.03 % → 4.96 %) when a weaker-than-expected NFIB small-business survey dampened rate-hike speculation; no day in the period posted a move ≥ 10 bp.  
4. Relative context: The 4.85 % close is the lowest since August 2025 and sits 28 bp beneath the 1-year average of 5.13 % (FRED statistical panel). Spreads are also tight: CI SBH reports investment-grade OAS at or near multi-year lows after January’s single-digit tightening (CI SBH, “Rising Yields, Tight Spreads,” Feb 2026).

Linkage to Fed policy events
• 2026-01-28 FOMC meeting – The Committee left the fed-funds range unchanged at 3.50-3.75 % and confirmed that balance-sheet runoff had ended (Fed press release 20260128a). Because the decision and statement were widely expected, the corporate-yield series showed almost no reaction on the day (5.00 % on 1-28 vs 4.99 % on 1-30).  
• Fed communication – On 2026-01-12, NY Fed President John Williams argued that policy had moved “closer to neutral” after 2025’s 75 bp of cuts and that inflation should “peak in H1-26” (NY Fed speech 20260112). His remarks reinforced the market view that additional easing was likely later in 2026, fostering a bullish tone in intermediate-maturity credit; the BAMLC4A0C710YEY series slipped from the 5.05-5.07 % area in early January to just below 5 % by the FOMC meeting.  
• Rate-cut expectations – Fed-funds futures continue to price two quarter-point cuts in H2-26 (cited in U.S. Bank “How Changing Interest Rates Affect Bonds,” July 2021 article updated with 2026 assumptions). Lower expected front-end rates tend to compress intermediate-corporate yields directly (via Treasury benchmarks) and indirectly (via narrower swap-spreads/OAS), contributing to the 10-12 bp grind lower observed since mid-January.

Credit-spread / market-technical influences
• Investment-grade spreads: CI SBH shows IG OAS tightening 6 bp across maturities in January, placing option-adjusted spreads back at cycle tights (CI SBH, Feb 2026). Tighter spreads offset part of the parallel rise in Treasury yields seen in January, helping hold the index near 5 %.  
• Corporate issuance: Strong demand for new BBB and A paper—highlighted by record-tight concessions in mid-February utility and bank deals—pulled secondary spreads even tighter, letting the effective yield fall even as the 10-year Treasury hovered around 4.25 %.  
• “Flight-to-quality within credit”: Indian data from Whalesbook (Feb 16 2026) echo the same theme globally—investors favour high-grade issuers for modest pick-up over sovereigns. That bid for quality has spilled into the US market, particularly in the 7-10 year bucket that dominates the ICE index.  
• Supply/demand imbalance in mortgages: The announcement that the GSEs may buy $200 bn of MBS (CI SBH) boosted broader spread products in late January, indirectly supporting IG corporates via cross-sector rotation.

Why the yield fell while Treasury yields rose modestly
The 10-year Treasury yield rose 11 bp in January (4.15 → 4.26 %, CI SBH), yet the 7-10 year IG corporate yield is down over the full month. The difference is almost entirely due to spread compression: IG OAS fell 6 bp in January and at least another 3-4 bp through mid-February. In addition, the corporate index carries a slightly longer dollar-weighted duration than the benchmark Treasury; coupon reinvestment and carry at ≈ 4.9 % cushioned price losses.

Key take-aways for forecasters (looking toward the 2026-02-26 target date)
1. Momentum points lower: Absent a macro surprise, spreads are biased to remain tight given solid corporate balance-sheets, limited near-term maturities, and abundant demand (BondBloxx outlook 2026).  
2. Fed catalyst risk: Kevin Warsh’s pending chairmanship and the March FOMC could inject volatility if language shifts toward patience on further easing, but that would mainly affect the front end; intermediate corporates should remain anchored by carry and demand from total-return buyers.  
3. Range expectation: In current conditions the BAMLC4A0C710YEY series is likely to fluctuate in a 4.75-5.05 % band. A re-test of the December-2025 lows (~4.76 %) is plausible if Treasury yields drift sideways and spreads stay at cycle tights.

Remaining information gaps
No significant gaps remain for the purpose of describing the last month’s history and the drivers of movement: we have daily values back to 2026-01-15, the latest print, quantitative change figures, and contemporaneous policy/spread commentary from authoritative Fed and market sources.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
