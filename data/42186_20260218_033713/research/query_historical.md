Analysis:
To forecast the daily effective yield of the ICE BofA 7-10 Year US Corporate Index for 2026-02-26, the most helpful outside view will come from:
• The recent time-series behaviour of the exact FRED series (level, day-to-day volatility, reaction to the last FOMC meeting, etc.).  
• Current commentary on investment-grade corporate bond yields, credit spreads, and Treasury-rate expectations in mid-February 2026.  
• Background information on how this index is constructed and how it tends to move around Fed announcements and month-end adjustments.  
Therefore, searches should retrieve: (1) the FRED data itself, (2) any market commentary or analysis published in the last few days, and (3) methodological or historical discussions of the index.
