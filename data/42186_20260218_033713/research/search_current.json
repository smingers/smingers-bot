He noted that hyperscaler AI capital spending forecasts have surged from $670 billion to $740 billion by 2026, threatening to drain the free cash flow of the 'Mag 7' tech giants and push them into negative cash flow, forcing massive bond issuance and 'crediting' their previously pristine balance sheets. Hartnett identifies the key turning point signal as a tech giant announcing a reduction in capital spending, which would trigger a dramatic rotation from tech ('Wall Street') to Main Street assets. He describes the AI disruption as a 'wildfire' spreading rapidly from tech to traditional services\u2014insurance brokers, wealth advisors, real estate, and logistics\u2014each affected in sequence. Political factors are amplifying this shift: with Trump\u2019s support high on Wall Street but low among Main Street voters (36.4% dissatisfaction with inflation), Hartnett predicts a 'Trump bump' absence in the February 24 State of the Union could trigger aggressive affordability policies, including yield curve control and potential universal basic income, benefiting small-cap stocks. Since October 29, 2025, asset performance has diverged sharply: winners include silver (+56%), Korea\u2019s KOSPI (+34%), Brazil\u2019s Bovespa (+30%), and energy (+20%); losers include Mag 7 (-8%), crypto (-41%), and software (-30%). A historically significant shift is the positive correlation between the Japanese yen and Nikkei index for the first time since 2005, signaling a long-term bull market, though Hartnett warns against a yen surge below 145, which could destabilize exporters and trigger global deleveraging. Despite $46.3 billion in global equity inflows, BofA\u2019s Bull & Bear Indicator remains at 9.4 (in 'sell' territory), and the risk asset 'sell signal' since December 17, 2025, remains active. Key portfolio shifts include cash rising from 3.2% to 3.8%, bonds moving from net underweight 35% to 25%, tech stocks shifting from net overweight 17% to neutral, and consumer staples recovering from net underweight 30% to 10%. Drawing on a 50-year history of 'great rotations' driven by major events\u2014such as the 1971 Bretton Woods collapse, 1980s inflation shock, 1989 Berlin Wall fall, 2001 9/11, and 2020 pandemic\u2014Hartnett forecasts the next leadership cycle will shift to emerging markets and small-cap stocks, citing structural shifts: a move from big tech growth to small-cap value, from services to manufacturing, and rising AI infrastructure costs, with hyperscalers issuing $170 billion in bonds over five months\u2014far exceeding the $30 billion annual average from 2020\u20132024\u2014creating mounting pressure on credit spreads.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 11:06 PM\nSource:[\u51e4\u51f0\u7f51\uff08\u51e4\u51f0\u65b0\u5a92\u4f53\uff09](https://finance.ifeng.com/c/8qp1qt0C9ki)\n\n**HYEM**\nThe VanEck Emerging Markets High Yield Bond ETF aims to closely replicate the price and yield performance of the ICE BofAML Diversified High Yield US Emerging Markets Corporate Plus Index, before fees and expenses.

(NYSE: LBRT) to 'Buy' from 'Neutral' on February 17, 2026, raising its price target to $31 from $20. The stock, trading at $26.23, is just below its 52-week high of $27.21 and has delivered a 40.3% year-to-date return. Analyst Chase Mulvehill cited structural power business growth and cyclical completions upside as key drivers for the upgrade. BofA expects Liberty Energy to transition from 100% oil and gas completions to a 50/50 split between oil/gas and power by 2030 in terms of EBITDA, with current EBITDA at $600.77 million and a market cap of approximately $4.28 billion. The company is targeting 3 gigawatts of power capacity by year-end 2029, advancing commercial, operational, and financing efforts. InvestingPro data shows moderate debt levels and four consecutive annual dividend increases, with a current yield of 1.39%. BofA maintained its 2026 and 2027 EBITDA estimates at $465 million and $770 million, respectively, reflecting a 5% decrease and 15% increase versus consensus. The firm extended its DCF model to 2030 and lowered its terminal decline rate from 1.1% to 0.1% due to the higher power mix in 2030 EBITDA. BofA expects completions to trough in 2026 with upside in 2027 and beyond. In related news, Liberty Energy priced a $700 million offering of 0.00% convertible senior notes due in 2031\u2014up from an initial $500 million\u2014and expects the offering to close on or about February 6, 2026. The company also amended its credit agreement with JPMorgan Chase and other lenders to allow a new bridge loan facility of up to $600 million, with a maturity no later than 365 days after incurrence, and a deadline of June 30, 2026, to incur the loan. The notes are being sold to qualified institutional buyers under Rule 144A, with initial purchasers granted an option to buy an additional $70 million within 13 days of issuance. The stock declined following the notes announcement, as the company plans to use proceeds to strengthen its financial position and support operational strategies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 02:44 PM\nSource:[Investing.com South Africa](https://za.investing.com/news/analyst-ratings/bofa-upgrades-liberty-energy-stock-rating-on-power-growth-outlook-93CH-4117545)\n\n**BofA Survey Reveals Strong Gold Optimism Amid Risk Caution: Average Peak Forecast at $6,200**\nAccording to the February 2025 BofA Global Fund Manager Survey, investors are showing strong optimism about gold, with a weighted average forecast of $6,200 per ounce for its peak price. Nineteen percent of respondents expect gold to rise above $7,000, while 20 percent believe it has already reached its peak. The 'long gold' position\u2014investments made in anticipation of rising gold prices\u2014was the most crowded trade for the second consecutive month, with 50 percent of participants holding this view. Gold's strong appeal is reflected in portfolio allocations: net overweight in equities reached 48 percent, the highest level since December 2024, while net underweight in bonds fell to 40 percent, the lowest since September 2022. Investors expect long-term bond yields to rise (57 percent) and short-term yields to fall (46 percent). The combined weight of equities and commodities reached a net 76 percent, the highest since January 2022. Investors increased exposure to emerging markets (net +49 percent) and Eurozone equities (net +35 percent), while reducing exposure to U.S. equities (net -22 percent). Demand for energy, basic materials, and consumer staples rose in February, while outflows were observed from U.S. equities, technology, and dollar-denominated assets. Risk indicators are also notable: the BofA Bull & Bear Indicator rose to 9.5, entering the 'sell' zone, signaling a reversal. Twenty-five percent of respondents identified the 'AI bubble' as their top tail risk, while 43 percent cited private equity and private credit markets as potential sources of a systemic credit crisis. The survey reflects a dual investor stance: increasing allocation to gold and riskier assets, while maintaining caution toward potential bubbles and credit risks. The $6,200 average peak forecast and the $7,000 scenario remain central to market expectations.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 01:26 PM\nSource:[S\u00f6zc\u00fc Gazetesi](https://www.sozcu.com.tr/abd-li-bankadan-carpici-anket-altin-icin-dengeleri-altust-edecek-tahmin-p294773)\n\n**Crestwood Advisors Group LLC Purchases 81,924 Shares of iShares Broad USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF $USIG**\nCrestwood Advisors Group LLC increased its stake in iShares Broad USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (NASDAQ: USIG) by 18.0% in the third quarter of 2025, acquiring an additional 81,924 shares, bringing its total ownership to 537,199 shares, valued at $28,053,000, or 0.18% of the fund.

Chae highlighted a historic investment boom expected to lead to a productivity boom, citing 9% revenue growth in corporate private equity in Q4 2025 with resilient margins. Inflation is viewed as 'basically under control,' with stable labor costs and shelter inflation running well below lagging CPI measures. CEO optimism in Blackstone\u2019s survey reached its highest level in over a year, with virtually no expectation of a recession in the next 12 months. Capital markets remain robust, supported by healthy growth and moderating inflation, with tight high-yield and investment-grade spreads. Chae projected 2026 as a highly active year for deployment, fundraising, and fee growth. Blackstone invested $138 billion in 2025\u2014the highest in four years\u2014including $42 billion in Q4\u2014and completed eight public-to-private transactions. Key growth drivers include AI and digital infrastructure, power and electrification, life sciences, private credit, secondaries, and liquidity solutions. Asia, representing 40% of the global economy but only 8% of global AUM, is a strategic focus, with increased activity in India and Japan. Fundraising reached $239 billion in 2025, up 40% YoY, with institutional inflows up over 50%, individual investor sales up over 50%, and insurance inflows up ~20%. Institutional AUM exceeds $700 billion, up 60% over five years; infrastructure AUM is $77 billion, up 40% YoY; and private wealth AUM surpassed $300 billion, up threefold in five years. Blackstone expects 2026 drawdown fundraising to exceed 2025 levels, and the firm anticipates a 'large-scale scheduled crystallization' of incentive fees in 2027, following strong 2026 fund launches. The firm\u2019s perpetual capital platform now accounts for nearly half of fee-earning AUM, supporting compounding management fees and incentive fees. In private credit, the $520 billion platform delivered 16% FRE growth and 37% DE growth in 2025, with 11% gross performance in non-investment-grade credit and 17% in real estate high yield. Software represents 7% of AUM and 10% of the credit platform, with protections including low loan-to-value ratios (<40%) and a focus on large companies (avg. EV > $4B). The software portfolio achieved high single-digit revenue growth and low double-digit EBITDA growth. In real estate, values remain down ~16% since 2022, but data centers, industrials, and multifamily fundamentals are improving; Manhattan leasing activity is at a six-year high, and San Francisco trophy properties saw double-digit rent growth. BREIT returned 8.1% net in 2025, its best performance since 2022. Internally, Blackstone uses AI tools in software development (2x engineer efficiency), cybersecurity (30% faster investigations), legal and compliance (Norm AI, 50% efficiency gain), and data automation (73 Strings, 'transformational' for efficiency). Proprietary private market data is seen as a strategic advantage as public data becomes commoditized. Blackstone\u2019s business, founded in 1985 and headquartered in New York City, operates across alternative asset management, private equity, real estate, credit, hedge fund solutions, and infrastructure.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 07:02 PM\nSource:[dailypolitical.com](https://www.dailypolitical.com/2026/02/16/blackstone-sees-strong-fundamentals-flags-active-2026-for-deployment-fundraising-and-fees-at-bofa-conf.html)\n\n**Ally Financial Sees 2026 Margin Rebound, Targets Mid-Teens Returns at BofA Conference**\nAlly Financial executives, led by Chief Financial Planning and Investor Relations Officer Sean Leary, expressed optimism about the company's 2026 outlook during a fireside chat at a Bank of America conference. In 2025, Ally achieved 'solid operational and execution across all businesses,' with key metrics including a 1.97% retail auto credit loss rate, flat expenses, and a meaningful increase in the CET1 ratio\u2014effectively meeting two of three conditions for achieving 'mid-teens' returns. The remaining condition is reaching a net interest margin in the upper threes. Leary expects the margin to be flat for one or two quarters following Federal Reserve easing, with a full-year target of 360 to 370 basis points, implying significant margin expansion in the second half of 2026. The company's core franchises\u2014Dealer Financial Services, insurance, and Corporate Finance\u2014continue to strengthen, with record consumer application flow and insurance premiums in 2025. The deposits franchise has grown for 67 consecutive quarters since 2009, with the vast majority FDIC-insured. Structural tailwinds include the replacement of lower-yielding assets (e.g., mortgages at ~3%) with higher-yielding loans (e.g., auto and Corporate Finance at 9%+), and $35 billion in CDs maturing in 2026, expected to yield a 45\u201350 basis point refinancing benefit. Leary addressed lease-related headwinds, noting that 'literally four' plug-in hybrid models underperform due to expired tax credits, heavy incentives, and recalls, resulting in lease termination losses in Q4 and expected continuation in early 2026. Credit guidance for 2026 is a net charge-off range of 1.8% to 2.0%, with current trends pointing to the midpoint. The company maintains a long-term through-the-cycle loss view of 1.6% to 1.8%. Leary emphasized a 'bias for more' in insurance and Corporate Finance, citing durable fee income, capital efficiency, and disciplined underwriting. Deposit growth in 2026 may remain flat, but success is defined by customer retention and progress toward terminal deposit beta assumptions. Capital management prioritizes loan growth, dividends, CET1 ratio improvement (targeting 'in the nines'), and buybacks, with valuation influencing buyback pacing. Despite a Moderate Buy rating and exclusion from MarketBeat\u2019s top five 'quietly whispered' stock picks, management remains confident that execution toward sustainable mid-teen returns will address investor skepticism.

He highlights that 1-2 year AAA corporate bond yields are available above 7%, with a low probability of further rate hikes, making accrual-oriented strategies in the short to medium segment more attractive than long-duration bets. Shah forecasts the 10-year G-Sec yield to trade in the 6.60-6.80% range until March 2026, with potential movement to 6.80-7.00% if growth and inflation rise. He anticipates $20-25 billion in foreign inflows from inclusion in the Bloomberg Global Aggregate Index, which could drive a 10-15 basis point rally in government bond yields. For retail investors, Shah recommends staying in short to medium duration funds and favoring corporate bonds (up to 2-3 years) and SDLs (8-12 years) due to widened spreads offering attractive risk-reward. He cautions against aggressive long-duration bets unless the 10-year G-Sec reaches 7% or long bonds trade between 7.60-7.70%, signaling a tactical entry opportunity. The large government borrowing programme starting April 2026 warrants a cautious stance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 04:03 AM\nSource:[Economic Times](https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/markets/bonds/end-of-rate-cuts-ample-liquidity-why-short-end-yields-above-7-look-attractive-says-devang-shah/articleshow/128382447.cms)\n\n**US Bond Volatility Heads for Biggest Annual Drop Since 2009**\nThe ICE BofA MOVE Index, a widely followed measure of U.S. bond-market volatility, fell to approximately 59 on Friday, its lowest level since October 2021 and down from about 99 at the end of 2024. Based on data dating back to 1988, this represents one of the steepest annual declines in volatility on record, second only to the drop seen in 2009. The decline follows Federal Reserve interest-rate cuts at three consecutive meetings starting in September, amid cooling labor-market conditions and a series of relatively benign economic indicators, including the strongest third-quarter GDP growth in two years. According to John Briggs of Natixis Corporate and Investment Banking, the lack of data capable of triggering sharp market moves has contributed to low volatility, which is typical at this time of year. Bond traders are pricing in two additional quarter-point rate cuts in 2026, with the first expected at the June meeting. Bloomberg strategists note that while the timing of further easing remains uncertain, expectations of lower policy rates and a modestly steeper yield curve are consistent with subdued volatility. Reduced trading activity during the holiday period has also played a role, though Briggs cautioned that January could bring surprises that challenge current market consensus.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 30, 2025 02:53 PM\nSource:[GuruFocus](https://www.gurufocus.com/news/4089509/us-bond-volatility-heads-for-biggest-annual-drop-since-2009)\n\n**US bonds shined in 2025 but returns could lose altitude next year**\nU.S. bond investors enjoyed a strong 2025, with total returns for the Morningstar US Core Bond TR YSD index reaching approximately 7.3%, the highest since 2020, driven by a 75 basis point reduction in Federal Reserve policy rates and a resilient U.S. economy that kept corporate credit spreads near historic lows. The ICE BofA US Corporate Index reported nearly 8% total returns for investment-grade debt, while high-yield bonds returned about 8.2%. However, market analysts anticipate a more challenging 2026, as the Federal Reserve is expected to cut rates by only around 60 basis points, less aggressively than in 2025. Additionally, fiscal stimulus from President Donald Trump\u2019s anticipated tax and spending policies may boost economic growth, limiting the decline in long-term Treasury yields. JPMorgan forecasts 10-year Treasury yields to end 2026 at 4.35%, while BofA Securities predicts 4.25%, with some analysts like Anders Persson of Nuveen cautioning that longer-dated bonds may underperform due to rising global government debt, leading him to remain 'underweight duration.' Investment-grade credit spreads, currently at 80 basis points, may widen to 110 basis points in 2026 according to JPMorgan, potentially reducing total returns to 3%, though BNP Paribas expects spreads to remain stable. Emily Roland of Manulife John Hancock Investments remains optimistic, arguing the bond market is underpricing disinflation and weaker growth, expecting a stronger rally in 2026 despite current market pricing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 30, 2025 11:22 AM\nSource:[Market Screener](https://www.marketscreener.com/news/us-bonds-shined-in-2025-but-returns-could-lose-altitude-next-year-ce7e59dbd08fff2c)\n\n**iShares Broad USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (NASDAQ:USIG) Sees Large Increase in Short Interest - Transcript Daily**\nThe iShares Broad USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (NASDAQ: USIG) announced a monthly dividend of $0.2062, paid on December 24, 2025, to shareholders of record on December 19, 2025.

The bonds affected are the 3.25% notes due 2049, the 3.05% notes due 2051, the 3.1% notes due 2060, and the 3.2% notes due 2061. BofA noted that these securities had risen by about 20 basis points after the Nvidia news and have performed well against the broader US Investment Grade Corporate index, as measured by ICE Data Indices. The bank also highlighted that the 10\u2011 to 30\u2011year yield curve has flattened to roughly 22 basis points, a level it views as appropriate and comparable to other large technology, media, and telecom debt structures. BofA maintains a Neutral rating at the issuer level and for other Intel bonds under its coverage, stating that the relative value on the yield curve appears suitable; bonds maturing in 10 years or less trade flat or below other BBB\u2011rated semiconductor peers. As BofA put it, 'BofA a abaiss\u00e9 sa notation sur plusieurs obligations \u00e0 long terme d'Intel Corporation (NASDAQ:INTC) de Surpond\u00e9rer \u00e0 Neutre', and it added, 'BofA a not\u00e9 que ces obligations ont progress\u00e9 d'environ 20 points de base suite \u00e0 l'annonce de Nvidia du 18 septembre'.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: September 22, 2025 10:23 AM\nSource:[Investing.com France](https://fr.investing.com/news/company-news/bofa-declasse-les-obligations-intel-a-neutre-apres-leur-hausse-suite-aux-nouvelles-de-nvidia-93CH-3058577)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
