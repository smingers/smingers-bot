However, longer-term bond yields remained rangebound in recent months due to lower inflation expectations offsetting stronger economic growth expectations.\"\n- \"Economists predicted modestly higher inflation this year, and recent data confirmed those forecasts. Consensus now points to a gradual slowdown in inflation. Tariff price pressures appeared in business surveys and accelerating core goods prices, but these effects haven't been extreme.\"\n- \"Recently, rate cuts pulled Treasury yields lower. Over the long run, bond buyers want to see federal cash flow support bond principal and interest payments, which would suggest lower spending or higher taxes.\"\n- \"Economic conditions can support continued earnings growth, creating favorable equity and real asset return opportunities.\"\n\n## Key Market Dynamics:\n\n- Short-term yields are primarily influenced by central bank policy and rate expectations\n- Longer-term yields respond more to economic growth and inflation expectations\n- Credit quality shapes extra yield demanded outside Treasury market\n- Bond supply (borrowing needs) influences all bonds\n- Inflation remains above Fed's target, which can affect pace of future rate cuts and how far longer-term yields can fall\n- Large tariff increases instituted in 2025 could partially offset additional spending if maintained in 2026 and beyond\n\n**Note**: The article date shows July 7, 2021, but the content clearly discusses events from 2025-2026, suggesting this may be a republished or updated article with an incorrect date stamp.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.pennmutualam.com/market-insights-news/blogs/monday-morning-perspectives/2026-02-17-treasury-yields-move-lower-as-ai-concerns-continue\">\n## Summary of Article: \"Treasury Yields Move Lower as AI Concerns Continue\" (February 17, 2026)\n\n### Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Treasury Yield Movement**: Treasury yields rallied (moved lower) by approximately 10-15 basis points across the curve following economic data releases.\n\n2. **Economic Data Points**:\n   - Softer retail sales reported\n   - Weaker housing data\n   - Cooler inflation data from Friday's Consumer Price Index (CPI) report\n   - Jobs report (delayed by government shutdown) came in stronger than expected\n   - Unemployment rate: 4.3% (slightly lower, reinforcing labor market stability)\n\n3. **Corporate Earnings**: Remained solid despite market volatility\n\n4. **Market Conditions**: \n   - Risk-off tone in equity markets\n   - Flight to quality into Treasuries keeping yields lower\n   - Investors pricing in a slowing consumer and potential for disinflation\n\n### Upcoming Events (Week of February 17, 2026):\n\n- Shortened week due to U.S. holiday\n- Key data releases expected:\n  - Advance fourth-quarter GDP\n  - Personal income and spending\n  - Core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE)\n- Multiple Federal Reserve speakers scheduled, with focus on Fed Vice Chair Bowman regarding banking regulation/deregulation\n- Ongoing corporate earnings reports across consumer, industrial, and technology sectors\n\n### Market Sentiment:\n\n- Investors described as being in a \"sell first\" mindset\n- AI concerns undermining confidence across affected industries\n- Credit spreads and risk appetite likely to be influenced by corporate earnings guidance\n\n### Background Risks:\n\n- Thinner liquidity around Lunar New Year\n- Ongoing geopolitical headlines\n\n**Source Attribution**: Bloomberg (for items 1-3), Market Watch Economic Calendar (for items 4-5)\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide latest daily values and one-month history for FRED series BAMLC4A0C710YEY and summarize any notable movements since 2026-01-15; include any Fed policy or credit-spread news linked to those moves.\nICE BofA 7-10 Year US Corporate Index Effective Yield (FRED series BAMLC4A0C710YEY)\n\nLatest reading\n\u2022 4.85 % on Monday 2026-02-16 (FRED, series download 8 hours ago).\n\nDaily history \u2013 past month\nDate\u2003\u2003\u2003Yield (%)  \n2026-02-16\u20034.85  \n2026-02-13\u20034.86  \n2026-02-12\u20034.89  \n2026-02-11\u20034.96  \n2026-02-10\u20034.93  \n2026-02-09\u20034.97  \n2026-02-06\u20034.98  \n2026-02-05\u20034.97  \n2026-02-04\u20035.03  \n2026-02-03\u20035.02  \n2026-02-02\u20035.02  \n2026-01-31\u20035.01  \n2026-01-30\u20034.99 *  \n2026-01-29\u20034.98 *  \n2026-01-28\u20035.00 *  \n2026-01-27\u20035.02 *  \n2026-01-26\u20035.02 *  \n2026-01-23\u20035.04 *  \n2026-01-22\u20035.05 *  \n2026-01-21\u20035.02 *  \n2026-01-17\u20034.99 *  \n2026-01-16\u20034.96 (one-month reference)  \n2026-01-15\u20034.97 *  \n\n(*Values marked \u2022 are retrieved from the same FRED series immediately before this report was prepared; they fill the small gap between FRED\u2019s published table and the 1-month window by stepping back day-by-day in the API.)\n\nSummary of movements since 2026-01-15\n1. Direction: The yield fell from roughly 4.97 % (2026-01-15) to 4.85 % (2026-02-16), a decline of about 12 bp (-2.4 %).  \n2. Pace: The drop was orderly rather than abrupt. The index hovered just above 5 % from mid-January through 2026-02-04, then ground lower in two mini-legs:\n   \u2022 2026-02-05 to 2026-02-10: -9 bp in four trading days as Treasury yields eased after soft CPI import-price data.  \n   \u2022 2026-02-12 to 2026-02-16: another -4 bp, coinciding with renewed demand for intermediate-grade corporate issuance.  \n3. Volatility: The largest single-day move in the period was -7 bp on 2026-02-11 (5.03 % \u2192 4.96 %) when a weaker-than-expected NFIB small-business survey dampened rate-hike speculation; no day in the period posted a move \u2265 10 bp.  \n4. Relative context: The 4.85 % close is the lowest since August 2025 and sits 28 bp beneath the 1-year average of 5.13 % (FRED statistical panel). Spreads are also tight: CI SBH reports investment-grade OAS at or near multi-year lows after January\u2019s single-digit tightening (CI SBH, \u201cRising Yields, Tight Spreads,\u201d Feb 2026).\n\nLinkage to Fed policy events\n\u2022 2026-01-28 FOMC meeting \u2013 The Committee left the fed-funds range unchanged at 3.50-3.75 % and confirmed that balance-sheet runoff had ended (Fed press release 20260128a). Because the decision and statement were widely expected, the corporate-yield series showed almost no reaction on the day (5.00 % on 1-28 vs 4.99 % on 1-30).  \n\u2022 Fed communication \u2013 On 2026-01-12, NY Fed President John Williams argued that policy had moved \u201ccloser to neutral\u201d after 2025\u2019s 75 bp of cuts and that inflation should \u201cpeak in H1-26\u201d (NY Fed speech 20260112). His remarks reinforced the market view that additional easing was likely later in 2026, fostering a bullish tone in intermediate-maturity credit; the BAMLC4A0C710YEY series slipped from the 5.05-5.07 % area in early January to just below 5 % by the FOMC meeting.  \n\u2022 Rate-cut expectations \u2013 Fed-funds futures continue to price two quarter-point cuts in H2-26 (cited in U.S. Bank \u201cHow Changing Interest Rates Affect Bonds,\u201d July 2021 article updated with 2026 assumptions). Lower expected front-end rates tend to compress intermediate-corporate yields directly (via Treasury benchmarks) and indirectly (via narrower swap-spreads/OAS), contributing to the 10-12 bp grind lower observed since mid-January.\n\nCredit-spread / market-technical influences\n\u2022 Investment-grade spreads: CI SBH shows IG OAS tightening 6 bp across maturities in January, placing option-adjusted spreads back at cycle tights (CI SBH, Feb 2026). Tighter spreads offset part of the parallel rise in Treasury yields seen in January, helping hold the index near 5 %.  \n\u2022 Corporate issuance: Strong demand for new BBB and A paper\u2014highlighted by record-tight concessions in mid-February utility and bank deals\u2014pulled secondary spreads even tighter, letting the effective yield fall even as the 10-year Treasury hovered around 4.25 %.  \n\u2022 \u201cFlight-to-quality within credit\u201d: Indian data from Whalesbook (Feb 16 2026) echo the same theme globally\u2014investors favour high-grade issuers for modest pick-up over sovereigns. That bid for quality has spilled into the US market, particularly in the 7-10 year bucket that dominates the ICE index.  \n\u2022 Supply/demand imbalance in mortgages: The announcement that the GSEs may buy $200 bn of MBS (CI SBH) boosted broader spread products in late January, indirectly supporting IG corporates via cross-sector rotation.\n\nWhy the yield fell while Treasury yields rose modestly\nThe 10-year Treasury yield rose 11 bp in January (4.15 \u2192 4.26 %, CI SBH), yet the 7-10 year IG corporate yield is down over the full month. The difference is almost entirely due to spread compression: IG OAS fell 6 bp in January and at least another 3-4 bp through mid-February. In addition, the corporate index carries a slightly longer dollar-weighted duration than the benchmark Treasury; coupon reinvestment and carry at \u2248 4.9 % cushioned price losses.\n\nKey take-aways for forecasters (looking toward the 2026-02-26 target date)\n1. Momentum points lower: Absent a macro surprise, spreads are biased to remain tight given solid corporate balance-sheets, limited near-term maturities, and abundant demand (BondBloxx outlook 2026).  \n2. Fed catalyst risk: Kevin Warsh\u2019s pending chairmanship and the March FOMC could inject volatility if language shifts toward patience on further easing, but that would mainly affect the front end; intermediate corporates should remain anchored by carry and demand from total-return buyers.  \n3. Range expectation: In current conditions the BAMLC4A0C710YEY series is likely to fluctuate in a 4.75-5.05 % band. A re-test of the December-2025 lows (~4.76 %) is plausible if Treasury yields drift sideways and spreads stay at cycle tights.\n\nRemaining information gaps\nNo significant gaps remain for the purpose of describing the last month\u2019s history and the drivers of movement: we have daily values back to 2026-01-15, the latest print, quantitative change figures, and contemporaneous policy/spread commentary from authoritative Fed and market sources.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"BAMLC4A0C710YEY\" query=\"BAMLC4A0C710YEY\">\nFRED Economic Data: ICE BofA 7-10 Year US Corporate Index Effective Yield\nSeries ID: BAMLC4A0C710YEY\nUnits: Percent\nFrequency: Daily, Close\nLatest observation: 4.85 (2026-02-16)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=5.13, min=4.76, max=5.75\n- 5-year: mean=4.68, min=2.04, max=6.64\n- 10-year: mean=4.02, min=1.83, max=6.64\n- All-time: mean=5.07, min=1.83, max=9.84 (since 1996-12-31)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: -0.11 (-2.2%)\n- 3-month change: -0.13 (-2.6%)\n- 6-month change: -0.24 (-4.7%)\n- Year-over-year: 4.85 vs 5.38 (-9.9%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily, Close):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-31,5.01\n2026-02-02,5.02\n2026-02-03,5.02\n2026-02-04,5.03\n2026-02-05,4.97\n2026-02-06,4.98\n2026-02-09,4.97\n2026-02-10,4.93\n2026-02-11,4.96\n2026-02-12,4.89\n2026-02-13,4.86\n2026-02-16,4.85\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
