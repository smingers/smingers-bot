Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**WINK News (Feb 12, 2026)**: Describes FBI lead processing after video release. Factual reporting on FBI procedures. Quality: Good regional news source. Relevant for understanding investigation timeline.

**BBC (Feb 16, 2026)**: Comprehensive coverage of Nancy Guthrie disappearance with specific details (age 84, missing since Feb 1, DNA evidence, reward increased to $100,000). Quality: High - reputable international outlet. Contains factual details from named officials (Sheriff Chris Nanos). Most recent source before question opening.

**New York Post (Feb 5, 2026)**: Reports on pacemaker data with expert opinion from Dr. Jonathan Reiner (named cardiologist). Quality: Moderate - tabloid but quotes identifiable expert. Factual timeline information mixed with medical speculation.

**AZPM/AP (Feb 13, 2026)**: Profile of Sheriff Nanos handling the case, including his acknowledged missteps. Quality: Good - AP wire service. Contains both factual information and opinions from named sources (Dr. Matt Heinz, Tom Morrissey).

**Greenville News (Feb 13, 2026)**: Reports on ransom notes and Craig Melvin's support. Quality: Good regional outlet. Factual details on three ransom notes demanding Bitcoin.

**CBS News (Feb 11, 2026)**: Reports 4,000+ calls in 24 hours, nearly 18,000 total calls. Quality: High - major network. Factual statistics and investigation details.

**Agent Report**: Comprehensive analysis of search patterns and scheduled events. Identifies that all spikes relate to the ongoing missing person case. Key finding: No scheduled events between Feb 18-24 except a Greenville workshop (Feb 20-21) for the *author* Nancy Guthrie (different person), which is already full and unlikely to generate "breaking news" coverage. Quality: High analytical value.

**Google Trends Data**: Shows current value of 14 on Feb 18, down from peak of 100 on Feb 14. Base rate analysis: 84% of 6-day windows show changes ≤3 points. Recent trend shows decline from peak (Feb 14: 100 → Feb 18: 14).

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Missing person cases with ongoing media coverage**: These typically show declining search interest after initial spike unless major developments occur (arrest, body found, ransom paid).

2. **Celebrity-adjacent news stories**: Nancy Guthrie's connection to Savannah Guthrie drives national interest, but such stories typically fade without new developments.

3. **6-day Google Trends windows for this specific search term**: Most suitable - directly applicable with 84% showing ≤3 point changes, 13% increases >3, 4% decreases >3.

**Selected reference class**: The 6-day window analysis for this specific term, as it's most directly applicable and accounts for the unique characteristics of this case.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 6 days (Feb 18-24, 2026)

**Historical pattern over similar periods**:
- The case began Feb 1, with major spikes on Feb 10 (video release, value 59), Feb 11 (93), Feb 14 (100)
- Most recent major development: DNA results announced Feb 17-18
- Current trajectory: Sharp decline from Feb 14 peak (100) to Feb 18 (14) - an 86-point drop in 4 days
- The 6-day base rate shows 84% stability (≤3 point change)

**Key observation**: We're currently at value 14, which is below the 90-day mean of 5.6 + 1 std dev (23.7), suggesting we're in a post-spike decline phase.

## (d) Justification

The search term "nancy guthrie breaking news" has shown extreme volatility tied to investigation milestones. The current value of 14 represents a significant decline from the Feb 14 peak of 100, following the DNA results announcement on Feb 17-18.

**Factors favoring "Doesn't change" (84% base rate)**:
- No scheduled press conferences or events identified for Feb 18-24
- DNA results already announced (Feb 17-18), reducing likelihood of immediate follow-up news
- The Greenville workshop (Feb 20-21) involves a different Nancy Guthrie (the author) and is unlikely to generate "breaking news" searches
- Historical pattern shows 84% of 6-day windows have ≤3 point changes
- We're currently in a declining phase after exhausting recent developments

**Factors favoring "Decreases" (4% base rate)**:
- Strong downward momentum: 100 → 44 → 29 → 15 → 14 over 4 days
- Natural decay pattern after major news events
- No obvious catalysts for renewed interest in the immediate 6-day window
- Value of 14 could easily drop to 10 or below (>3 point decrease) following the established decline trajectory

**Factors favoring "Increases" (13% base rate)**:
- Unpredictable nature of criminal investigations (arrests, discoveries, new evidence)
- Case remains unsolved with active investigation
- However, no scheduled developments are known

The critical question: Will the decline continue, or has it stabilized? The value dropped from 15 to 14 (1 point) between Feb 17-18, suggesting deceleration. However, the momentum from 100 to 14 in 4 days is substantial.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate of 84% for "Doesn't change" is compelling, but I must consider:

1. **Current momentum**: The sharp decline from 100 to 14 suggests we're in an active decay phase, not a stable plateau. This argues against simply accepting the 84% base rate.

2. **Position in the cycle**: At value 14, we're closer to the floor than the ceiling. The 90-day mean is 5.6, suggesting limited downside (to ~10-11) versus substantial upside potential if news breaks.

3. **Asymmetric risk**: A decrease from 14 to ≤10 (4+ points) is plausible given momentum. An increase to ≥18 (4+ points) would require new developments, which are unpredictable but possible in active investigations.

4. **Historical upset rate**: In criminal investigations, unexpected developments occur regularly. The 13% base rate for increases may underweight this in an active, high-profile case.

5. **Deceleration evidence**: The Feb 17→18 change was only 1 point, suggesting the decline may be stabilizing.

**Calibration considerations**:
- The 84% base rate likely overstates stability during an active decline phase
- The 4% decrease rate likely understates probability given current momentum
- The 13% increase rate seems reasonable for unexpected developments

**Adjusted reasoning**:
- "Doesn't change" (value stays 11-17): ~50-60% - decline is decelerating but not yet stable
- "Decreases" (value ≤10): ~30-40% - momentum supports continued decline
- "Increases" (value ≥18): ~10-15% - requires unexpected news
