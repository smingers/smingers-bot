Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**WINK News (Feb 12, 2026):** Describes FBI lead processing following video release. Factual reporting on investigative procedures. Quality: Regional news outlet, moderate reliability. Date: 6 days before forecast opening.

**BBC (Feb 16, 2026):** Comprehensive coverage including DNA findings on glove, suspect description, reward increase to $100,000. High-quality international news source. Date: 2 days before forecast opening. Contains factual details from law enforcement (Sheriff Nanos quotes) and investigative developments.

**NY Post (Feb 5, 2026):** Reports on pacemaker data with expert analysis from Dr. Jonathan Reiner (named cardiologist). Mix of facts and expert medical opinion. Date: 13 days before forecast opening. Tabloid source but includes verifiable expert commentary.

**AZPM/AP (Feb 13, 2026):** Focuses on Sheriff Nanos's handling of the case, including criticisms and his attendance at basketball game. Contains both factual timeline and opinion from local officials (Dr. Matt Heinz). Date: 5 days before forecast opening.

**Greenville News (Feb 13, 2026):** Details ransom notes, FBI video release, colleague support. Factual reporting with official statements. Date: 5 days before forecast opening.

**CBS News (Feb 11, 2026):** Reports 18,000 total tip calls, extensive search operations. Includes expert opinion from Ben Weiss (crypto reporter) on Bitcoin traceability. Date: 7 days before forecast opening.

**Agent Report:** Comprehensive analysis of search patterns, confirms no scheduled events 18-24 Feb except author Nancy Guthrie's workshop (unrelated person). Identifies that all spikes relate to the kidnapping case. High analytical value.

**Google Trends Data:** Shows current value of 14 on Feb 18, down from peak of 100 on Feb 14. Recent 7-day average (45.0) higher than prior 7-day (27.6), but clear declining trend from peak. Base rate: 84% of 6-day windows show ≤3 point change.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Missing person cases with national media attention:** Cases like Gabby Petito (2021) showed initial spike followed by sustained interest with periodic peaks when new evidence emerged. However, interest typically declines without major developments.

2. **Google Trends behavior for breaking news events (6-day windows):** The provided base rate shows 84% stability (≤3 change), 13% increases, 4% decreases over 6-day periods. This is the most directly applicable reference class.

3. **Celebrity-adjacent crime stories:** Cases involving family members of public figures can maintain elevated interest, but typically follow decay patterns after initial peak unless new dramatic developments occur.

**Most suitable:** The Google Trends base rate for 6-day windows is most suitable because it directly measures the specific metric we're forecasting and accounts for the natural volatility of the search term.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 6 days (Feb 18-24, 2026)

**Historical pattern over similar periods:**
- Current value (Feb 18): 14
- Peak was Feb 14: 100
- The term has declined from 100 → 44 → 29 → 15 → 14 over 4 days (Feb 14-18)
- This represents a sharp post-peak decline of 86 points in 4 days
- No values from Feb 1-2 (initial disappearance) are shown in 30-day window, suggesting they fell outside the relative scaling

**Key observations:**
- Major developments (video release Feb 10, DNA results Feb 17-18) created spikes
- Current value (14) is well below recent mean (45.0 for last 7 days)
- The decline from 100 to 14 suggests the story is in a post-peak decay phase
- Agent report confirms no scheduled events Feb 18-24 likely to generate "breaking news"

## (d) Justification

The current value of 14 represents a significant decline from the Feb 14 peak of 100. The case has entered a phase where:

1. **Major investigative milestones have been announced:** Video release (Feb 10), DNA results (Feb 17-18), search warrants executed, family cleared as suspects.

2. **No scheduled catalysts:** Agent report confirms no press conferences scheduled, no related events between Feb 18-24 except an unrelated author's workshop.

3. **Natural decay pattern:** The 4-day decline from 100 to 14 follows typical breaking news decay curves when no new developments emerge.

4. **Base rate strongly favors stability:** 84% of 6-day windows show ≤3 point changes.

**Scenarios for change:**

*Increase (>17):* Would require major breakthrough - arrest, discovery of Nancy Guthrie (alive/deceased), or new ransom contact. While possible, the investigation appears to be in evidence-analysis phase rather than imminent-breakthrough phase.

*Decrease (<11):* Would require sustained absence of news AND no weekend media coverage. Given the case remains active and unsolved, some baseline coverage likely continues.

*Stable (11-17):* Most likely given base rate, current investigation phase, and absence of scheduled developments.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate of 84% for "no change" (≤3 points) is compelling but requires calibration:

1. **Current position in news cycle:** We're 4 days past a major peak, in clear decline phase. This suggests momentum is downward rather than stable.

2. **Weekend effect:** Feb 22-23 (Saturday-Sunday) may see reduced news coverage, potentially accelerating decline.

3. **Investigation phase:** The case is in evidence-analysis mode (DNA testing, tip processing) rather than active-breakthrough mode, reducing likelihood of sudden spikes.

4. **Threshold sensitivity:** Starting at 14, we need to stay within 11-17 for "no change." A value of 10 or 18 would trigger resolution to decrease/increase respectively.

5. **Historical upset rate:** In breaking news contexts, unexpected developments do occur. However, the agent report's finding that no events are scheduled reduces the probability of planned announcements.

**Probability adjustments:**
- Base rate suggests 84% stable, but declining momentum and weekend timing suggest higher probability of continued decrease
- Increase probability should be lower than base 13% due to investigation phase and lack of scheduled catalysts
- Decrease probability should be higher than base 4% due to clear declining trend and position post-peak

Calibrating for:
- Strong declining trend from peak
- No scheduled catalysts
- Weekend timing likely to reduce coverage
- Investigation in evidence-analysis rather than breakthrough phase
- But maintaining some probability of unexpected developments (arrest, discovery, new evidence)

Outside View Prediction:

Increases: 8%
Doesn't change: 47%
Decreases: 45%
