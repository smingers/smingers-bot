Analysis:

1) Resolution/criteria (paraphrase, <30 words)  
Between 2026-02-18 and 2026-02-24 (US, fixed 2026-01-25–2026-02-24 Trends window), compare daily values: +>3 = “Increases”, within ±3 = “Doesn’t change”, ->3 = “Decreases”.

2) (a) Source analysis (what each says, quality, date; facts vs opinions)

- Fox News live updates (Feb 17, 2026): Reports FBI using investigative genetic genealogy; no CODIS match; Google has other camera video; quotes Sheriff Nanos; includes expert CeCe Moore’s optimism (opinion). Quality: mixed but uses identifiable officials; timely.  
- Los Angeles Times (Feb 17): Detailed recap: kidnapping timeline, video details, CODIS no-hit, Walmart/backpack lead, ransom-note context, quotes officials; expert speculation about recognition (opinion). Quality: high; timely.  
- ABC7 live updates (Feb 17): Similar factual recap; tips volume; CODIS no-hit; ongoing DNA work. Quality: decent local broadcast; timely.  
- AZPM (Feb 17): Local reporting: no DNA match, pacemaker location efforts, Walmart lead, warrants still processing. Quality: good local; timely.  
- NY Post (Feb 16): Trump comments about death penalty; mixes political framing with some facts. Quality: tabloid; factual core likely but sensational.  
- KVOA (Feb 17): Brief local update; little incremental detail. Quality: local; limited.  
- AskNews / Mint (Feb 18): Claims “fourth ransom note” to TMZ and bitcoin demand. This is second-hand and the authenticity of ransom communications is often unclear; treat as uncertain until confirmed by law enforcement. Quality: moderate-low; timely but verification weak.  
- AskNews / TV Insider (Feb 17): “Today” show prayer segment; mostly human-interest; facts about case are secondary. Quality: entertainment-news; not investigative.  
- Other AskNews items (HELLO!, Express/GB News, LBC, GEO TV, Mediaite, Yahoo): Mostly repackaging; some are sensational or entertainment-media. Mediaite/Yahoo can be decent for media-coverage facts; investigative claims should be treated cautiously.

3) (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence
- None that directly predicts a rise by Feb 24; no confirmed breakthrough (arrest/proof-of-life/recovery) as of Feb 18.

Moderate evidence
- Current momentum is post-peak decay: multiple reliable sources describe an investigation in “processing/analysis” mode (DNA separation, IGG underway, video recovery). That typically produces intermittent updates but declining baseline attention.  
- “No CODIS hit” is a development, but it’s not a dramatic resolution event; tends to sustain coverage briefly then fade.

Weak evidence
- Unverified “fourth ransom note” to TMZ could create a short-lived spike, but unless validated by officials or followed by major action, it likely won’t lift Feb 24 above Feb 18 by >3.  
- Political/celebrity-adjacent amplification (Trump comments, TV segments) can create noise, but is volatile and hard to time for the specific end date (Feb 24).

4) (c) Timeframe analysis
Window length is 6 days (Feb 18 → Feb 24).  
- If halved (~3 days): “Doesn’t change” would become more likely because there’s less time for either a breakthrough spike or continued decay to exceed ±3.  
- If doubled (~12 days): “Decreases” becomes more likely because attention usually decays absent a major resolution, and ±3 is a low threshold.

5) (d) Justification: inside-view adjustment from outside-view base rates
Outside view distribution given: Increases 8 / Doesn’t change 47 / Decreases 45.

Key inside-view considerations:
- Status quo (if nothing major happens): continued tapering coverage after mid-February’s heavy reporting. That pushes slightly toward “Decreases.”  
- Feb 18 itself likely sits on an “update day” (DNA/IGG/ransom-note chatter). If Feb 18 value is elevated by fresh headlines, regression by Feb 24 becomes more likely (i.e., a drop of >3).  
- Upside risk (arrest/IGG identification/recovered video/proof-of-life): real, but timing is uncertain; even if news breaks, it must be close enough to Feb 24 to keep that day’s value > Feb 18 by >3. This keeps “Increases” nontrivial but still the least likely.

Net: I nudge probability mass from “Doesn’t change” to “Decreases,” and modestly raise “Increases” because the case remains active and high-profile, but not enough to dominate the decay dynamic by Feb 24.

Probability calibration

- Increases: 12  
- Doesn’t change: 38  
- Decreases: 50  

Checklist:
1) Criteria/options aligned: Feb 24 value vs Feb 18; ±3 = no change; >3 up/down = increase/decrease.  
2) Outside-view base rate used: [8, 47, 45].  
3) Consistency check: Most likely=Decreases; Least likely=Increases; consistent with post-peak decay + low-threshold rule.  
4) Main evidence (each <20 words):  
   - Multiple sources: no CODIS hit; IGG underway; investigation in lab/analysis phase.  
   - Recent reporting intensity suggests Feb 18 may be locally elevated.  
   - Typical breaking-news attention decays without an arrest/recovery.  
   - Unverified ransom-note reports likely cause brief, not durable, spikes.  
5) Blind spot: A major arrest/recovery/proof-of-life on Feb 23–24 would flip to “Increases.”  
6) Status quo: slow change dominates; favor small decline over stability given decay momentum.  
7) Technicalities: probabilities 0–100, sum to 100.
