Analysis

1. Paraphrase of options & rule (<30 words)  
Compare Google Trends value for “nancy guthrie breaking news” on 24 Feb vs 18 Feb (US, fixed-dates URL).  
>3 higher = “Increases”; within ±3 = “Doesn’t change”; >3 lower = “Decreases”.

2. Outside-view base rates (90-day empirical, 6-day windows)  
Increases 13 | Doesn’t change 84 | Decreases 3  = 100

3. Consistency check  
Most likely = Doesn’t change; least likely = Decrease or Increase (rough tie).  Adjusted probabilities below align with narrative justification.

4. Key evidence (≤20 words each)  
a. Continuous daily coverage; fourth ransom note (18 Feb) keeps story alive but no breakthrough yet.  
b. Sheriff/FBI say IGG testing “matter of time”, implying weeks not days—major arrest within 6 days less likely.  
c. Trend index already down to 30 from earlier peak; natural news-cycle decay over a week is common.  
d. Google Trends threshold small (±3); routine rescaling noise alone can move ≤3 points, favouring “Doesn’t change”.  
e. Any dramatic event (body found, arrest) would instantly drive searches well >+3.

5. Blind-spot scenario  
Sudden viral social-media campaign (e.g., TikTok sleuth finds suspect) spikes searches >100 before 24 Feb – would make “Increase” far likelier.

6. Status-quo outcome  
Absent fresh blockbuster news, media attention slowly tapers; index drifts slightly down but may stay within ±3.

7. Technicalities checked: probabilities sum to 100, no % signs.

(a) Source analysis (quality & fact/opinion separation) – abbreviated  
• Fox News, LA Times, ABC7, AP/azpm: reputable mainstream outlets, factual updates from officials; opinion quotes identified.  
• AskNews digest items (Mint, TV Insider, etc.): mixture of wire copy and entertainment press; still factual, though tone can be sensational.  
All are dated 16-18 Feb—fresh and relevant.

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong: historical Google Trends variability; rule-matching 90-day dataset.  
Moderate: repeating official statements that lab work will take longer than a week (DNA, IGG).  
Weak: speculative ransom-note chatter, pundit predictions, social-media sentiment.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon = 6 days.  Halve (3 days): even less chance of breakthrough ⇒ raise “Doesn’t change” a few points.  Double (12 days): more time for major news ⇒ shift ~10 pts from “Doesn’t change” to “Increase” and “Decrease” (mostly “Increase”).

(d) Justification of inside-view adjustment  
• The 90-day base is dominated by pre-abduction zeros and one huge spike, overstating stability; once a topic is at mid-level (30) six-day swings >3 are empirically common (look-back since 3 Feb shows ~40 % of windows exceed ±3).  
• Current media cadence suggests slow decline unless a breakthrough occurs; downward drift therefore receives extra weight relative to base.  
• Breakthrough probability (arrest, discovery) is real but less than one-in-four given lab timelines and past missing-person precedents.  
• Combining these shifts yields roughly: 20 % Increase (breakthrough), 50 % No change, 30 % Decrease (gradual fade or rescaling).

Probability calibration  
I started at the reference 13/84/3, then:  
+7 pts to Increase (chance of dramatic development)  
–34 pts to No-change (higher short-term volatility than historic zeros)  
+27 pts to Decrease (likely slow fade and rescaling noise)  
Net: 20 | 50 | 30.
