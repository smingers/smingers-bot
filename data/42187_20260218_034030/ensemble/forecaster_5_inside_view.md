Analysis
(a) Source analysis (abridged)  
1. Fox News 17 Feb – Straight-news recap of FBI/DNA developments; primary quotes from sheriff, FBI, Parabon. Reliable for factual chronology.  
2. LA Times 17 Feb – Detailed timeline, multiple named experts. High factual quality.  
3. ABC7 17 Feb – Live-update wire; duplicates official statements. Reliable.  
4. AP/WAND 16 Feb – Wire-service summary; mixes many stories, Guthrie items sourced to sheriff. Reliable for facts.  
5. Mint 18 Feb – Aggregates TMZ report of a 4th ransom note; single-source, still factual, moderate reliability.  
6. TV Insider, Hello!, Express etc. – Entertainment outlets re-reporting Savannah Guthrie pleas; low-medium reliability, mostly repetitive.  
7. Google Trends baseline (direct scrape) – Objective numeric data; strongest quality for resolution metric.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• No arrest, body, or suspect announced as of 18 Feb (multi-source confirmation) → large spikes historically coincide with such breakthroughs.  
Moderate evidence  
• 4th ransom note story on 18 Feb may boost searches temporarily but similar earlier notes produced only medium bumps (~+5-10 points).  
• Media continuing daily mentions (Savannah Guthrie pleas, TV interruptions) keeps interest from collapsing quickly.  
Weak evidence  
• DNA genealogy “matter of time” quotes – timing speculative; breakthrough could just as easily arrive outside six-day window.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution window: six days (18 → 24 Feb). Halved (three days) would further reduce chance of dramatic news; doubled (12 days) would meaningfully raise “increase” odds as investigation progresses.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base rate (past 90 days, six-day windows): Increases 13 %, No-change 83 %, Decreases 4 %.  
Inside factors:  
+ Ongoing national coverage and a fresh ransom-note headline raise the floor for near-term attention.  
+ However, decisive case-breaking news (arrest / recovery) required for a >3-point surge is uncertain and historically infrequent; IGG results rarely arrive inside a week.  
– Interest was already revitalised 16-18 Feb (value ≈30). If nothing big happens, natural decay of a news cycle could pull value below 27, giving a >3-point drop.  
– Still, the many mid-tier follow-ups (pleas, prayers, commentators) usually slow the decay.

Net shift: modestly higher tails on both sides, primarily drawn from the “no-change” centre.

Probability calibration
Status-quo continuation (steady or small drift) still most likely but trimmed from 83 % to 60 %.  
Increase raised from 13 % to 25 % (allowing ≈1 in 4 chance of break-through, ransom-note proof-of-life, or dramatic TV interruption).  
Decrease lifted from 4 % to 15 % (room for attention to ebb once ransom-note story fades).

---------------- CHECKLIST ----------------
1. Options recap: Compare Google-Trends daily value for 24 Feb vs 18 Feb. >+3 → Increases; within ±3 → Doesn’t change; <-3 → Decreases.  
2. Outside base: 13 / 83 / 4.  
3. Consistency: Most-likely = Doesn’t change; Least-likely = Decreases? (now tied lower than Increase). Makes sense given analysis.  
4. Key evidence (≤20 w each)  
   – No arrest/body announced yet (reduces sharp rise).  
   – Fresh ransom-note headline 18 Feb (small-to-moderate boost).  
   – Continuous national TV/print coverage (slows decay).  
   – Prior spikes only with major revelations (historical pattern).  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden discovery of Nancy alive/dead before 24 Feb; would push Increase probability >70 %.  
6. Status-quo bias applied, but tempered by active media environment.  
7. Probabilities sum to 100, within 0-100, no % sign.

Probabilities: [25, 60, 15]
