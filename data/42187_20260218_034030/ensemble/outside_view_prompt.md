You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “nancy guthrie breaking news” change between 2026-02-18 and 2026-02-24 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “nancy guthrie breaking news” at the time of writing this question (Feb 16, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 30; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=nancy%20guthrie%20breaking%20news&date=2026-01-17%202026-02-16).

`{"format":"trends_interest_change_magnitude","info":{"topic":"nancy guthrie breaking news","trend_start":"2026-02-18","trend_end":"2026-02-24","verification_url":"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=nancy%20guthrie%20breaking%20news&date=2026-01-25%202026-02-24"}}`

The options are: ['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves “Doesn't change” if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=nancy%20guthrie%20breaking%20news&date=2026-01-25%202026-02-24](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=nancy%20guthrie%20breaking%20news&date=2026-01-25%202026-02-24) for 2026-02-24 is within 3 of the value at 2026-02-18. It resolves “Increases” if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves “Decreases” if the value is more than 3 lower.

# Summary of Article: "Nancy Guthrie's 2 a.m. pacemaker ping could point to heart rate-spiking struggle, lead cardiologist says"

**Source:** New York Post  
**Date:** February 05, 2026  
**Author:** Georgia Worrell

## Key Facts and Timeline:

1. **Pacemaker Activity:** Nancy Guthrie's (age 84) implanted pacemaker stopped syncing with her Apple devices (watch and iPhone) around 2 a.m. on Sunday, close to when police believe she was abducted from her Tucson, Arizona home.

2. **Last Seen:** She was last seen the night before the disappearance when her son-in-law dropped her home at approximately 9:45 p.m.

3. **Discovery:** When investigators arrived at her home around noon (after she was reported missing), her devices were still inside the house.

4. **Search Status:** As of Thursday (February 5, 2026), the search was in its fifth day.

5. **Evidence at Scene:** Arizona law enforcement found drops of blood, signs of a struggle, and her life-saving daily medication at Guthrie's home.

## Expert Opinion (Named Source):

**Dr. Jonathan Reiner** (former cardiologist to Vice President Dick Cheney) provided analysis to CNN:

- **Struggle Theory:** "If a person was in a physical struggle, that might have created a rapid heartbeat … the pacemaker would have detected that and potentially reported it."

- **Routine Check-in Theory:** Pacemakers are programmed to check in once daily (typically at night) with communication devices and monitoring apps, so the 2 a.m. activity "might have been doing" just that.

- **Distance Parameters:** Pacemakers cease syncing with communication devices when they're between 5 and 20 feet apart. This means "she was in close proximity to her cell phone at 2 o'clock in the morning … until that time, they were together."

- **Determining the Cause:** It would "be easy to know" whether the spike indicated a routine check-in or an arrhythmia (suggesting struggle) by checking with Guthrie's implanting physician, who would have the data.

- **Health Risks:** An 84-year-old is "very fragile" and "at risk of a very severe injury if they fall." If Guthrie "lost her footing or was pushed to the ground or somehow fell, that could result in a severe injury." Her unidentified medications may also work as blood-thinners, which would worsen any injuries.

## Law Enforcement Statement:

Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos stated "The clock is literally ticking" in reference to her missing medications.

## Context:

Nancy Guthrie is the mother of Savannah Guthrie (implied to be a public figure based on article references).

# Summary of Article: "Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos is in the national spotlight over Nancy Guthrie case"

**Source:** News.azpm (Associated Press)  
**Date:** Modified February 13, 2026, 10:42 a.m.  
**Author:** Jacques Billeaud

## Key Facts and Timeline:

- **Nancy Guthrie**, 84 years old, mother of "Today" show host Savannah Guthrie, disappeared from her Tucson-area home
- **Last seen:** January 31, 2026
- **Reported missing:** February 1, 2026
- **Case status at article publication:** Second week of investigation (as of Feb 13, 2026)
- **Major break:** On Tuesday (context suggests Feb 11, 2026), authorities released surveillance videos showing someone approaching her door wearing a gun holster, ski mask, and backpack
- Blood droplets found at the scene were confirmed to be Nancy Guthrie's
- A man was detained during a traffic stop south of Tucson after the videos were released, questioned, and later released

## Sheriff Chris Nanos Background:

- Started with Pima County Sheriff's Office as detention officer in 1984
- Appointed sheriff in 2015 when his predecessor retired
- Lost 2016 race to Republican Mark Napier
- Defeated Napier in 2020
- Won 2024 reelection by narrow margin of 481 votes against Republican Heather Lappin

## Acknowledged Missteps and Criticisms:

**Sheriff's own admissions:**
- "I'm not used to everyone hanging onto my every word and then holding me accountable for what I say"
- Acknowledged he "probably should have waited longer to relinquish Nancy Guthrie's home to her family" after detectives finished evidence collection
- Before authorities resecured the scene, journalists photographed blood droplets at the front door

**External criticism:**
- Dr. Matt Heinz (Democrat, county board member) criticized Nanos for attending a University of Arizona basketball game last weekend while the victim was still missing: "That does not look good. I mean, dude, watch the game at home. Read the room."

**Sheriff's response to criticism:**
- Told Green Valley News that no one can work around the clock
- "I got to a point where I needed to decompress a little bit and back away from my team a little bit so I'm not on them all the time"

## Opinions on Investigation Handling:

**Critical perspective (Dr. Matt Heinz):**
- Believes the late-campaign administrative action against Lappin likely affected the 2024 race outcome
- Said it's "equally important not to get out there in front of a bunch of cameras and talk when there's not really anything actionable or helpful or of interest"

**Supportive perspective (Tom Morrissey, retired chief U.S. marshal and former Arizona Republican Party chairman):**
- Wouldn't criticize Nanos
- Noted it can get complicated when trying to inform the public while not providing information that might help suspects
- "The perpetrator or perpetrators are watching what law enforcement is doing up close and personal, and it does impact their ability to avoid being discovered or arrested"

**Sheriff's own assessment:**
- Acknowledged annoyance with AP reporter's questions about FBI responsibilities
- "I'm going to have people who think I'm doing a good job, and I'm going to have people think I am doing a bad job. But that's what we have elections for."

</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Identify past search spikes for the exact phrase “nancy guthrie breaking news” and list any associated hoaxes, death rumors, book releases, or conference appearances; also note any scheduled events between 18–24 Feb 2026 that mention Nancy Guthrie.
The phrase “nancy guthrie breaking news” has appeared almost exclusively in U.S. media coverage surrounding the still-unresolved disappearance of 84-year-old Arizona resident Nancy Guthrie, mother of NBC “Today” anchor Savannah Guthrie. Google-indexed news stories that actually contain the words “breaking news” in their headlines or URL begin on 1 February 2026 (the day she was reported missing) and continue through the present. No evidence was found of the exact phrase being paired with the evangelical author and speaker Nancy Guthrie prior to February 2026, and no unrelated death-hoax, book-launch, or normal speaking engagement has ever generated the wording “nancy guthrie breaking news” in the Google corpus.

1. Documented search-interest spikes (Google Trends context)

Date window of spike  | Triggering development  | Typical wording found in contemporaneous headlines/URLs  
a. 1 Feb 2026          | Initial missing-person report filed; local outlets post “Breaking News: Nancy Guthrie missing.” (CNN 14 Feb 2026; USA Today 16 Feb 2026)  
b. 2–5 Feb 2026       | First ransom note, confirmation of Nancy’s blood on porch, sheriff’s daily briefings; many stories used “Breaking News Update.” (USA Today timeline, 16 Feb 2026)  
c. 10 Feb 2026         | FBI releases recovered doorbell-camera video; national cable networks went live with “breaking-news” banners. (CBS News 17 Feb 2026)  
d. 13–14 Feb 2026     | Court-ordered search of a nearby residence; CNN and local affiliates produce rolling “breaking news” coverage. (CNN live blog, 14 Feb 2026)  
e. 17–18 Feb 2026     | Lab result shows gloves contain unknown male DNA; NBC News runs all-day “Live Breaking News” blog. (NBC News live blog 18 Feb 2026; KTUL 17 Feb 2026)

Because the disappearance is ongoing and highly publicised, each investigative milestone has repeatedly pushed Trend values into the high double digits. The current value of 30 (for 16 Feb 2026) under a 30-day lens therefore represents a low-level plateau rather than the earlier peaks that reached or approached 100 between 1 Feb and 10 Feb 2026. No earlier historical spikes (e.g., 2025 or before) were located.

2. Associated hoaxes, death rumours, or misinformation

• Fake-ransom schemes: 42-year-old Derrick Callella was charged on 13 Feb 2026 for impersonating a kidnapper to solicit Bitcoin (USA Today 16 Feb 2026).  
• Online speculation accusing family members: explicitly debunked by Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos, who stated on 17 Feb 2026 that the “Guthrie family is innocent” (NBC News 18 Feb 2026; KTUL 17 Feb 2026).  
• Death rumour: As of 18 Feb 2026 authorities still list Nancy Guthrie as missing, not deceased; no death-hoax headlines for her have circulated.  
• Unrelated viral rumours (e.g., August–September 2025 “Is Trump dead?” hoax – WCIV 30 Aug 2025; BBC 2 Sep 2025) do not involve Nancy Guthrie and did not influence searches for the phrase in question.

3. Book releases

The Bible-teacher Nancy Guthrie’s most recent trade-book publication remains Even Better than Eden (Crossway, 2018). Retail listings from Ligonier Ministries and Westminster Bookstore show no 2025–2026 release or preorder bearing her name (Ligonier Store listing, accessed 16 Feb 2026; Westminster Bookstore catalogue). Therefore, no book launch has coincided with the “breaking news” key-phrase or with observable Google-Trends bumps.

4. Conference or speaking appearances that overlapped with spikes

Author/speaker Nancy Guthrie’s event calendar is unrelated to the missing-person case, but it does produce search traffic for her name in general. The only dated appearance inside the resolution window is:

• Biblical Theology Workshop for Women, Downtown Presbyterian Church, Greenville SC – two formats:  
  – Friday 9 a.m.–3 p.m. on 20 Feb 2026 (nancyguthrie.com, Speaking page, retrieved 16 Feb 2026)  
  – Friday evening 20 Feb & Saturday morning 21 Feb 2026 (same source)  
The workshop is listed as “NOW FULL,” indicating significant preregistration but no media coverage using “breaking news.”

No other public engagement, conference keynote, livestream, or radio appearance for either of the two distinct Nancy Guthries is scheduled between 18 Feb and 24 Feb 2026 according to her official speaking calendar. Future workshops in Charleston SC (Feb 2027) and Detroit MI (Mar 2027) fall outside the trend-measurement window.

5. Summary with respect to the forecasting question

• All historical Trend spikes for the exact phrase trace back to the law-enforcement timeline in February 2026.  
• The most recent substantive development (no CODIS match for glove DNA, announced 18 Feb 2026 – NBC News live blog) has already generated headline-level coverage, implying that 18 Feb is itself a local high point.  
• No additional scheduled events featuring either the missing person or the author fall between 18 Feb and 24 Feb 2026 except the Greenville workshop, and that workshop has no news-value component likely to trigger “breaking news” treatment.  
• Unless investigators announce a major breakthrough (discovery of Nancy Guthrie alive or deceased, arrest of a suspect, pacemaker signal found, etc.) within 18–24 Feb, the dataset suggests the Trend metric is more likely to hold near the current value (≈30) or decline gradually rather than increase.

Information gaps identified

• Exact numeric Google-Trends values for each spike (1 Feb, 5 Feb, 10 Feb, 14 Feb, 18 Feb) are not provided in the news sources and would require direct extraction from the Trends interface.  
• Confirmation that no press conferences are slated after 18 Feb 2026; the sheriff’s office said none are “scheduled” as of 18 Feb but that could change (NBC News 18 Feb 2026).  
• Verification that author Nancy Guthrie will not appear in any webcast or podcast during the 18–24 Feb window; her website lists only the Greenville in-person workshop.

Absent new law-enforcement revelations, there is currently no planned activity capable of adding a “breaking news” trigger to ordinary coverage between 18 Feb and 24 Feb 2026.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
