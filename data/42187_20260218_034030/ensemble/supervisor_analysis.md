Disagreement Analysis:

1. **Probability of "Decreases" outcome: Wide spread from 5% to 50%**
   - Forecaster_3 assigns 50% to Decreases, forecaster_4 assigns 30%, while forecasters 1 (24%), 5 (15%), and 2 (5%) are much lower.
   - The core disagreement is about how quickly search interest will decay from the current elevated level (~30) over 6 days. Forecaster_3 believes the Feb 18 value is likely elevated by fresh headlines (ransom note) and will regress significantly by Feb 24. Forecaster_2 believes the post-spike plateau is stable and decay within 6 days is unlikely to exceed 3 points.
   - This is the largest source of disagreement, swinging the weighted average significantly.

2. **Current baseline value and what Feb 18 will actually register**
   - Forecasters disagree on what the Feb 18 anchor value will be. Forecaster_1 references a value of ~14 (suggesting the 30 was a 30-day peak, not the current daily value), while forecasters 2 and 5 reference ~30 as the current level. This is critical because the resolution compares Feb 24 to Feb 18, and the starting point determines how much room there is for change.
   - Forecaster_1's entire analysis is built around a value of 14, while others work from ~30. If the Feb 18 value is actually around 14 (low), a ±3 threshold is relatively wide; if it's around 30, there's more room for meaningful drops.

3. **Probability of a major breakthrough (arrest, body found, IGG result) within 6 days**
   - Forecaster_5 gives 25% to Increases (implying ~25% chance of breakthrough-level news), forecaster_4 gives 20%, while forecasters 2 (16%) and 3 (12%) are lower.
   - This depends on factual questions about the current state of the investigation, particularly IGG/DNA processing timelines and whether any imminent announcements have been signaled.

Root Causes:

1. **Decay rate disagreement**: Primarily different weighting of the same evidence (news cycle decay patterns vs. sustained coverage). Also partly different factual beliefs about whether the Feb 18 value is artificially elevated by a one-day ransom note spike.

2. **Baseline value disagreement**: Different interpretations of the Google Trends data. The question states the current value is 30 compared to the last 30 days, but the resolution URL uses a different date range (Jan 25 - Feb 24), which will rescale values. This is a factual/technical disagreement about how Google Trends rescaling works and what the actual daily values will be.

3. **Breakthrough probability**: Different factual beliefs about IGG processing timelines and investigation status, combined with different weighting of base rates for missing-person case developments.
