Resolution of Disagreements:

**1. Current baseline value and what Feb 18 will actually register:**
The research could not directly resolve what the Google Trends daily value for Feb 18 will be under the resolution URL's date range (Jan 25 - Feb 24). The agent report confirms that Google Trends values are only available from the Trends interface itself and cannot be inferred from news coverage. However, the research does clarify the context: the question states the current value is 30 compared to the last 30 days (Jan 17 - Feb 16). The resolution URL uses a different window (Jan 25 - Feb 24), which will rescale values. Forecaster_1's reference to a value of ~14 appears to be based on a specific daily reading within a different scaling window, while the "30" is the value as of Feb 16 in the 30-day window. This disagreement remains partially unresolved, but the key insight is that under the resolution URL's scaling, the Feb 18 value could be different from 30 depending on what the peak is in that window. This remains uncertain.

**2. Investigation status and breakthrough probability:**
The research strongly supports that NO arrest or major breakthrough is imminent:
- DNA from the glove did NOT match CODIS (announced Feb 17)
- DNA from the glove doesn't match DNA found at the home
- Additional DNA testing is still required; the glove was sent back to Arizona for state-level testing before CODIS entry
- IGG/genealogy testing is being pursued but is a weeks-to-months process
- Gun/holster investigation involves checking 40 names at gun shops - still in progress
- No suspects identified; two people detained and released
- Investigation described as facing "setbacks" with DNA yielding no results

This evidence supports the lower end of breakthrough probability estimates (forecasters 2 and 3 at 12-16%) rather than the higher estimates (forecasters 4 and 5 at 20-25%). A major breakthrough within 6 days appears unlikely given the lab work timelines.

**3. Decay rate / media attention trajectory:**
The research shows the case is still generating substantial daily coverage (multiple major outlets publishing on Feb 16-17), but the nature of coverage is shifting from "breaking news" to analysis, misinformation concerns, and investigation updates. The Feb 17 articles about DNA not matching CODIS represent a "setback" narrative rather than forward momentum. This supports moderate decay in search interest, though the case remains highly prominent nationally.

The fourth ransom note mentioned by forecaster_1 is not clearly confirmed in the research - the ransom notes discussed are from earlier in February. The research mentions ransom demands forwarded to FBI but no specific new Feb 18 ransom note.

Updated Analysis:

The research resolves the breakthrough probability disagreement in favor of lower probability (no CODIS match, IGG weeks away, no suspects). This reduces the "Increases" probability somewhat from the weighted average.

For "Decreases" vs "Doesn't change": The investigation is in a lull phase with DNA setbacks, which could either maintain steady interest (people checking for updates) or lead to gradual decay as no new dramatic developments emerge. The ±3 threshold is relatively forgiving for "Doesn't change." Given that:
- The case remains nationally prominent with daily coverage
- But the news cycle is shifting from breaking developments to analysis/waiting
- No breakthrough is likely within 6 days
- The ±3 threshold provides a buffer against small declines

I think the weighted average slightly overweights "Increases" given the clear evidence against an imminent breakthrough. I'll shift a few points from "Increases" to "Doesn't change" and leave "Decreases" roughly where it is, as gradual decay remains plausible but the ±3 buffer makes "Doesn't change" the most likely outcome.

The weighted average of [18.2, 57.0, 24.8] should be adjusted to reduce "Increases" slightly (given no imminent breakthrough) and increase "Doesn't change" modestly.

Confidence: MEDIUM

Probabilities: [15, 60, 25]
