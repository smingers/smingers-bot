**Author:** Mitchell Koch

## Key Facts and Timeline:

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

**Gil Carrillo** (Former Los Angeles Sheriff's Department Lt., instrumental in capturing "The Night Stalker" serial killer in the 1980s):
- Misinformation and conspiracy theories can be a "huge roadblock for investigators"
- "With all of these people that are getting on social media rendering their opinions and their thoughts, investigators have to take time from their investigation and assign people to follow those leads up because they all have to be followed. Every one of them has to be vetted out."
- Emphasized that withholding critical information in high-profile cases is necessary to prevent suspects from knowing what law enforcement is doing
- "You have to keep the press at arm's length. You keep your secrets close to the vest."

**Rachel Blackbourn** (The Integrity Project, an Arizona-based organization dedicated to combating misinformation):
- Widespread interest is expected in high-profile cases
- "People care, people want to see justice enacted, but as a result of that, people are sharing their opinions, they are speculating"
- Some influencers might use the case to capitalize on their following: "People like influencers make a living based on the volume of their audience. In high-profile cases like these, this is a huge trigger to grow an audience."

## Key Issues Identified:
- **Misinformation from unverified sources** about Nancy Guthrie's disappearance remains rampant
- Law enforcement must investigate all leads and tips, meaning time spent verifying bogus claims takes away from actual case progress
- Limited information being released by authorities may be contributing to speculation

**Source:** Extra (Celebrity News)  
**Date:** February 17, 2026

   - DNA collected from the glove did not match any DNA in the national database (CODIS)
   - The DNA from the gloves did not match DNA found at Nancy Guthrie's property

   - Pima County Sheriff's Department confirmed: "There were no DNA hits in CODIS. At this point, there have been no confirmed CODIS matches in this investigation."
   - The department stated that DNA found at the property is still being analyzed and requires further testing

3. **Investigation Direction (from Sheriff Chris Nanos):**
   - Authorities will pursue genealogy testing and analyze partial DNA found at the home
   - Sheriff Nanos stated the DNA at the home is "more critical than any glove I found 2 miles away"
   - Multiple gloves have been found at various distances (2 miles, 5 miles, 10 miles away), which authorities are prioritizing accordingly
   - Sheriff believes they "may have some DNA there that may be our suspect" but confirmation requires DNA separation, sorting, and potential submission to CODIS or genealogy testing

4. **Additional Investigation Efforts:**
   - According to TMZ, law enforcement is reaching out to manufacturers and retailers for information about items seen in the surveillance video released last week

5. **Background:**
   - Nancy Guthrie (Savannah Guthrie's mother) was kidnapped from her Tucson home on February 1, 2026

# Summary of Article: "Nancy Guthrie Glove Update: More Tests Being Done"

**Source:** AOL (via Reality Tea)  
**Date:** February 17, 2026

## Key Facts and Developments:

1. **DNA Testing Status:** A DNA test has been performed on a glove found two miles from Nancy Guthrie's house in Florida, but additional testing is still required before a possible suspect can be identified.

2. **Timeline of Disappearance:** Nancy Guthrie's disappearance was discovered on Sunday, February 1, 2026, after she missed a virtual church service with friends.

3. **Investigation Details:**
   - The Pima County Sheriff's Department (Arizona) is working with the FBI
   - Nancy Guthrie is the mother of Today show host Savannah Guthrie

4. **CODIS System Requirements:** According to TMZ sources and federal law, an item must first be tested in the state where it originates before the FBI can enter the DNA profile into the CODIS system. The glove has been sent back to Arizona for this reason. It's unclear why the Pima County Sheriff initially sent the glove to Florida.

5. **Multiple Gloves:** The glove being tested is different from one photographed by the New York Post.

6. **DNA Testing Process:** PCR tests can reveal results in a day, with CODIS results potentially available the next day or sooner. The CODIS system contains close to 27 million DNA profiles.

7. **Gun Investigation:** News Nation reported that law enforcement provided 40 names to gun shops in the Tucson region, checking if anyone purchased a gun similar to one seen in doorbell camera video of Nancy's alleged abductor. The gun was visible in a holster. TMZ reported authorities can identify the holster type and have identified 40 people who purchased it.

8. **Ransom Demands:** TMZ reported that ransom demand letters were forwarded to the FBI.

9. **Reward:** A $100,000 reward is being offered for information leading to Nancy's abductors.

Query: What is the current Google Trends daily value for "nancy guthrie breaking news" for February 18, 2026, using the URL https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=nancy%20guthrie%20breaking%20news&date=2026-01-25%202026-02-24? Please report the specific daily values for the most recent available dates.
The search results retrieved for “nancy guthrie breaking news” (all dated February 8 – 18 2026) are exclusively mainstream-news and local-news reports covering the ongoing investigation into the disappearance of 84-year-old Nancy Guthrie.  Key examples include:

• NBC News live blog detailing day-of developments on 18 Feb 2026 (NBC News, 18 Feb 2026).  
• A News18 backgrounder recap on 16 Feb 2026 (News18, 16 Feb 2026).  
• Multiple New York Post articles summarising DNA and ransom-note revelations on 15 Feb and 8 Feb 2026 (New York Post, 15 Feb 2026; New York Post, 8 Feb 2026).  
• WCTV/CNN “breaking news” clip about FBI surveillance images on 10 Feb 2026 (WCTV, 10 Feb 2026).

Every article is focused on crime-scene facts, police statements, DNA tests, ransom demands, and public appeals.  None of the pieces mention, embed, or screen-shot Google Trends data, nor do they reproduce the numeric, 0-to-100 “interest-over-time” values that Google Trends assigns to each day within a locked date range.

Consequently:

1.  The specific numeric value of Google Trends “interest” for the exact date 2026-02-18—as it would appear on the fixed-scale URL  
   https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=nancy%20guthrie%20breaking%20news&date=2026-01-25%202026-02-24—is absent from all retrieved material.

2.  No secondary source provides a table or list of daily values for the most recent dates in that range (e.g., 2026-02-15 through 2026-02-18).  

3.  Because Google Trends values are dynamic, relative, and accessible only inside the Trends interface (or via an API such as PyTrends), journalistic coverage rarely includes the underlying numbers.  The absence of such figures in the retrieved content is therefore consistent with normal practice.

Implications for the forecasting question (“Will the interest change between 18 Feb and 24 Feb?”):

•  To apply the resolution criteria—“Increases,” “Decreases,” or “Doesn’t change (±3)”—one must know the value displayed for 18 Feb 2026 and, later, the value for 24 Feb 2026 within the locked-scale window 25 Jan → 24 Feb 2026.  
•  Those two datapoints are indispensable and cannot be inferred from news-story volume or media sentiment; they must be read directly from Google Trends.  

Remaining information gap:

•  Exact Google Trends “interest-over-time” numbers for “nancy guthrie breaking news,” at minimum for 2026-02-18 (baseline) and for 2026-02-19, 20, 21, 22, 23 so that the time-series trend leading into 24 Feb can be monitored.  

Until those values are extracted from the Google Trends interface or programmatically via the same fixed-scale parameters, the original query cannot be fully answered, and the forecasting market cannot be adjudicated.</Agent_report>
