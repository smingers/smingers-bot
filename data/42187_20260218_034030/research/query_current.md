Analysis:
To judge whether Google search interest in “nancy guthrie breaking news” will shift in the next six days, I need to know if anything likely to spark extra searches—e.g., a death notice, major controversy, conference appearance, book launch, or TV/radio segment—has just happened or is scheduled before Feb 24. Fresh reporting in general-web results, the news vertical, and curated news aggregators will reveal whether Nancy Guthrie is currently in headlines or on an upcoming program agenda that could drive a spike. Therefore I’ll look for: (1) real-time mentions of the exact phrase; (2) broader coverage of “Nancy Guthrie” in the past few days; (3) any dated announcements or event calendars pointing to Feb 18-24 activities.
