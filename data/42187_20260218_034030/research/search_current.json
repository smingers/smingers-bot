Hicks expressed heartfelt support, stating he and a community of people are praying for Nancy, her mother, and the entire family. Melvin requested a brief prayer, which Hicks delivered, asking for God\u2019s light, grace, mercy, and goodness to bring hope, peace, and resolution to the situation.

The duo aired a tearful video posted by Savannah the previous day, in which she pleaded: 'It's never too late to do the right thing and we are here.

They are comparing it to DNA found at the home and collaborating with Google to analyze surveillance footage. A S.W.A.T. team searched a home about a mile from Nancy\u2019s, and a traffic stop was conducted for a black Range Rover. No arrests have been made, and investigators are 'leaning away from any of Nancy's relatives as potential suspects.'

The appeal came after investigators analyzed DNA found on a glove recovered from a field approximately two miles from Guthrie\u2019s home. The glove matches one worn by a suspect seen in doorbell-camera footage from the night Nancy Guthrie went missing on February 1. The video shows a masked man in gloves and a backpack approaching the camera, attempting to cover it with his gloved hand before using brush from the front yard to obstruct the view. Authorities believe the suspect kidnapped Nancy in the early hours of February 1. The released footage has been pivotal in the investigation.

Authorities believe she was abducted in the middle of the night. The FBI released video and images from a Google Nest camera showing a man with an average build, approximately 5 feet 9 inches to 5 feet 10 inches tall, wearing a ski mask, gloves, and a black 25-liter Ozark Trail Hiker Pack backpack, which is sold exclusively at Walmart. Law enforcement reviewed footage from a Walmart location in Tucson, though Walmart corporate declined to comment. A black glove found near Guthrie\u2019s home matches the gloves in the video and contains DNA evidence being tested; preliminary results were received on Saturday, with confirmation pending before entering the unknown male profile into the FBI\u2019s CODIS database, a process that typically takes 24 hours. The Guthrie family has released multiple videos urging the abductor to return Nancy, emphasizing that 'it is never too late to do the right thing,' and expressing belief in the essential goodness of every human being. Authorities are investigating a ransom note demanding payment in bitcoin, initially sent to CBS News affiliate KOLD-TV, which the family addressed in a video while requesting proof of life. At least two homes have been searched, including one less than two miles from Guthrie\u2019s residence, searched Friday evening by multiple agencies including the Pima County Sheriff SWAT team. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos confirmed a search warrant was issued based on a lead, with no arrest made.

Initially, Google reported no data, but stated they would attempt to 'scratch'\u2014a delicate process akin to removing eight layers of paint to reach deeper data, with the goal of accessing the sixth or seventh layer without damaging existing information.

Authorities reported her missing the following day. The FBI has obtained a DNA sample from a glove found near her residence, which appears to match the gloves worn by a masked man captured on doorbell camera footage attempting to disable her home\u2019s security system before her abduction. Preliminary results from a private Florida lab were received on Saturday, and the FBI is conducting a national CODIS database search, with a 'hit' potentially confirmed within 24 hours. The glove is one of about 16 collected from a roadside field approximately 3km from her home; most were discarded by searchers, but this one is distinct and matches the suspect\u2019s attire. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos stated the suspect, seen wearing a gun holster and an over-stuffed backpack, is the primary person of interest and that Nancy, who has limited mobility, pacemaker, and frail health, was likely taken against her will. Traces of Nancy\u2019s blood were found on her front porch, confirmed by DNA testing. Two purported ransom notes were delivered to media outlets, but no direct contact has been made with the family or authorities. Law enforcement has not confirmed any proof of life or death. Acting on a federal court warrant, deputies and FBI agents searched a residence less than 3km from Nancy\u2019s home on Friday night. Savannah Guthrie, her brother Camron Guthrie, and sister Annie Guthrie have released multiple video appeals, expressing hope, willingness to meet ransom demands, and belief in humanity. The FBI confirmed that DNA not belonging to Nancy or her family members was also found on her property, but no official results have been released for those samples.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:44 AM\nSource:[RTE.ie](https://www.rte.ie/news/2026/0216/1558675-savannah-guthrie/)\n\n**GB News halted for 'deeply worrying' breaking alert**\nGB News was temporarily halted during a live broadcast after airing a breaking alert regarding the daughter of U.S. TV news anchor Nancy Guthrie, Savannah, releasing a new plea for her mother's release.

The individual was apprehended by the Pima County Sheriff's Department with assistance from the FBI in the Tucson area. FBI Director Kash Patel confirmed to Fox News host Sean Hannity prior to the reports that there are now persons of interest in the case. This follows earlier developments on the same day, including the FBI releasing images and security footage of a masked 'potential subject' involved in the abduction. Additionally, TMZ's Harvey Levin reported that there was 'activity' in the Bitcoin account linked to the first ransom note sent to media outlets, including TMZ, on Tuesday evening. The case has seen significant developments on February 11, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2026 03:08 AM\nSource:[Mediaite](https://www.mediaite.com/media/news/breaking-person-detained-for-questioning-in-connection-with-nancy-guthries-abduction/)\n\n**New images in Nancy Guthrie disappearance could \"break this case wide open,\" retired FBI agent says**\nNew surveillance images and videos released by the FBI in the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, mother of 'Today' co-host Savannah Guthrie, could 'break this case wide open,' according to retired FBI special agent Jason Pack. The footage, captured by a Nest camera at Guthrie's Tucson, Arizona home, shows a masked individual wearing a ski mask, gloves, and a backpack, and carrying what appears to be a weapon. The person is seen approaching the front door, raising a gloved hand toward the camera, and later covering the lens with prairie brush. Law enforcement sources indicate the individual is a subject under investigation but not yet a suspect or person of interest. The FBI recovered the footage from residual data in backend systems, working with Google, after the doorbell camera was disconnected at 1:47 a.m. on the day of her disappearance. Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos confirmed that footage was not immediately available due to lack of subscription to the service. Pack emphasized that the subject's attire\u2014especially the backpack, holster, and walk\u2014could trigger recognition from the public. Mary Ellen O'Toole, a former FBI profiler, suggested the individual may have conducted a dress rehearsal before the crime. Pack also noted the possibility of trace evidence on the welcome mat, which the suspect may have stepped on. Savannah Guthrie shared the images on Instagram, urging, 'Someone out there recognizes this person. We believe she is still out there. Bring her home.' A ransom note deadline passed without further contact, and no suspects have been identified. The FBI is offering a $50,000 reward and has established a tip line at 800-CALL-FBI. Retired supervisory agent Lance Leising criticized the suspect\u2019s approach as showing poor professionalism despite apparent planning. Pack believes public release of the images will increase pressure on the suspect, potentially leading to mistakes and breakthroughs.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 11, 2026 01:16 AM\nSource:[CBS News](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/nancy-guthrie-disappearance-video-analysis-fbi/)\n\n**NBC Halts Olympics Coverage With Breaking News About Savannah Guthrie's Mom**\nNBC temporarily halted its live coverage of the 2026 Milan Cortina Winter Olympics on February 10, 2026, to broadcast a breaking update on the disappearance of Nancy Guthrie, the 84-year-old mother of 'TODAY' anchor Savannah Guthrie.
