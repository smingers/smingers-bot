Southwest Florida  \n**Date:** February 12, 2026  \n**Authors:** Richard Kolko, Elyssa Morataya\n\n## Key Facts and Information:\n\n1. **Event:** The FBI released a video from Nancy Guthrie's house, which has resulted in a surge in leads for law enforcement.\n\n2. **Lead Processing:** \n   - Leads are directed to the National Threat Operations Center (N-TOC)\n   - Calls to the FBI (800-CALL-FBI) are answered in Clarksburg, West Virginia, at the FBI's Criminal Justice Information Services\n   - Threat intake examiners review each call or electronic submission\n\n3. **Process Details (per Grel Nelsen, former FBI agent):**\n   - Threat intake examiners evaluate information from electronic tips and phone calls\n   - They conduct analysis to determine where information needs to go for further action\n   - Information is typically sent to either a field office or a law enforcement partner\n   - Leads are prioritized based on importance or immediacy, not order received\n\n4. **Ongoing Investigation:**\n   - Analysts continue to piece together information after initial leads are addressed\n   - The goal is to create follow-on leads\n   - The investigation is described as being \"like a puzzle\" where each lead could be a key piece\n\n**Note:** The article does not provide specific numbers regarding the volume of leads received or other quantitative details about the case.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c5yrv2g16e2o\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Savannah Guthrie pleas for Nancy Guthrie release as FBI analyses glove\"\n\n**Source:** BBC  \n**Date:** February 16, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- **Nancy Guthrie**, 84 years old, disappeared two weeks prior to the article date in a suspected kidnapping\n- She was last seen on the evening of **January 31, 2026**, when a family member dropped her off at her home in **Tucson, Arizona**\n- Authorities believe she was kidnapped in the early hours of **February 1, 2026**\n- The FBI recovered a glove from a field about **two miles (three km)** from Guthrie's home\n- Investigators collected approximately **16 gloves** from various locations near her home, though most were discarded by people searching for her\n- The FBI has received preliminary DNA test results showing an \"unknown male profile\" on one glove that appears to match gloves worn by a suspect in surveillance video\n- Doorbell camera footage shows a masked man wearing gloves and a backpack attempting to cover the camera\n\n## Suspect Description:\n\n- Height: Between **5 ft 9 in and 5 ft 10 in (175-177 cm)** tall\n- Build: Average\n- Equipment: Wearing a **25-litre Ozark Trail Hiker Pack** (only sold at Walmart stores)\n- Clothing and face mask appear to have been purchased at Walmart\n\n## Investigation Details:\n\n- Search operation involves helicopters, sniffer dogs, and hundreds of officers\n- Thousands of call-in tips received\n- On Friday (prior to article date), authorities executed a search warrant at a residence two miles from Guthrie's home but made no arrests\n- DNA found at Guthrie's address that did not belong to her or anyone close to her\n- FBI reward increased from **$50,000 to $100,000** for information\n\n## Statements from Officials:\n\n- **Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos** told CBS News that the clothing and face mask appear to have been purchased at Walmart\n- Nanos stated Guthrie is \"not in good physical health\" but has no reported cognitive issues\n- On Monday, the sheriff said Guthrie's family, including all siblings and their spouses, \"have been cleared as possible suspects\"\n- Officials warned that her health may be at severe risk without her medication\n\n## Family Information:\n\n- **Savannah Guthrie** (US TV anchor) is Nancy Guthrie's daughter and issued a video appeal\n- Nancy Guthrie has another daughter named **Annie Guthrie**\n- Nancy was last seen after a family get-together at Annie's house\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://nypost.com/2026/02/05/us-news/savannah-guthries-moms-pacemaker-ping-could-mean-heart-rate-spiking-struggle-doctor/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Nancy Guthrie's 2 a.m. pacemaker ping could point to heart rate-spiking struggle, lead cardiologist says\"\n\n**Source:** New York Post  \n**Date:** February 05, 2026  \n**Author:** Georgia Worrell\n\n## Key Facts and Timeline:\n\n1. **Pacemaker Activity:** Nancy Guthrie's (age 84) implanted pacemaker stopped syncing with her Apple devices (watch and iPhone) around 2 a.m. on Sunday, close to when police believe she was abducted from her Tucson, Arizona home.\n\n2. **Last Seen:** She was last seen the night before the disappearance when her son-in-law dropped her home at approximately 9:45 p.m.\n\n3. **Discovery:** When investigators arrived at her home around noon (after she was reported missing), her devices were still inside the house.\n\n4. **Search Status:** As of Thursday (February 5, 2026), the search was in its fifth day.\n\n5. **Evidence at Scene:** Arizona law enforcement found drops of blood, signs of a struggle, and her life-saving daily medication at Guthrie's home.\n\n## Expert Opinion (Named Source):\n\n**Dr. Jonathan Reiner** (former cardiologist to Vice President Dick Cheney) provided analysis to CNN:\n\n- **Struggle Theory:** \"If a person was in a physical struggle, that might have created a rapid heartbeat \u2026 the pacemaker would have detected that and potentially reported it.\"\n\n- **Routine Check-in Theory:** Pacemakers are programmed to check in once daily (typically at night) with communication devices and monitoring apps, so the 2 a.m. activity \"might have been doing\" just that.\n\n- **Distance Parameters:** Pacemakers cease syncing with communication devices when they're between 5 and 20 feet apart. This means \"she was in close proximity to her cell phone at 2 o'clock in the morning \u2026 until that time, they were together.\"\n\n- **Determining the Cause:** It would \"be easy to know\" whether the spike indicated a routine check-in or an arrhythmia (suggesting struggle) by checking with Guthrie's implanting physician, who would have the data.\n\n- **Health Risks:** An 84-year-old is \"very fragile\" and \"at risk of a very severe injury if they fall.\" If Guthrie \"lost her footing or was pushed to the ground or somehow fell, that could result in a severe injury.\" Her unidentified medications may also work as blood-thinners, which would worsen any injuries.\n\n## Law Enforcement Statement:\n\nPima County Sheriff Chris Nanos stated \"The clock is literally ticking\" in reference to her missing medications.\n\n## Context:\n\nNancy Guthrie is the mother of Savannah Guthrie (implied to be a public figure based on article references).\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://news.azpm.org/s/102710-pima-county-sheriff-chris-nanos-is-in-the-national-spotlight-over-nancy-guthrie-case/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos is in the national spotlight over Nancy Guthrie case\"\n\n**Source:** News.azpm (Associated Press)  \n**Date:** Modified February 13, 2026, 10:42 a.m.  \n**Author:** Jacques Billeaud\n\n## Key Facts and Timeline:\n\n- **Nancy Guthrie**, 84 years old, mother of \"Today\" show host Savannah Guthrie, disappeared from her Tucson-area home\n- **Last seen:** January 31, 2026\n- **Reported missing:** February 1, 2026\n- **Case status at article publication:** Second week of investigation (as of Feb 13, 2026)\n- **Major break:** On Tuesday (context suggests Feb 11, 2026), authorities released surveillance videos showing someone approaching her door wearing a gun holster, ski mask, and backpack\n- Blood droplets found at the scene were confirmed to be Nancy Guthrie's\n- A man was detained during a traffic stop south of Tucson after the videos were released, questioned, and later released\n\n## Sheriff Chris Nanos Background:\n\n- Started with Pima County Sheriff's Office as detention officer in 1984\n- Appointed sheriff in 2015 when his predecessor retired\n- Lost 2016 race to Republican Mark Napier\n- Defeated Napier in 2020\n- Won 2024 reelection by narrow margin of 481 votes against Republican Heather Lappin\n\n## Acknowledged Missteps and Criticisms:\n\n**Sheriff's own admissions:**\n- \"I'm not used to everyone hanging onto my every word and then holding me accountable for what I say\"\n- Acknowledged he \"probably should have waited longer to relinquish Nancy Guthrie's home to her family\" after detectives finished evidence collection\n- Before authorities resecured the scene, journalists photographed blood droplets at the front door\n\n**External criticism:**\n- Dr. Matt Heinz (Democrat, county board member) criticized Nanos for attending a University of Arizona basketball game last weekend while the victim was still missing: \"That does not look good. I mean, dude, watch the game at home. Read the room.\"\n\n**Sheriff's response to criticism:**\n- Told Green Valley News that no one can work around the clock\n- \"I got to a point where I needed to decompress a little bit and back away from my team a little bit so I'm not on them all the time\"\n\n## Opinions on Investigation Handling:\n\n**Critical perspective (Dr. Matt Heinz):**\n- Believes the late-campaign administrative action against Lappin likely affected the 2024 race outcome\n- Said it's \"equally important not to get out there in front of a bunch of cameras and talk when there's not really anything actionable or helpful or of interest\"\n\n**Supportive perspective (Tom Morrissey, retired chief U.S. marshal and former Arizona Republican Party chairman):**\n- Wouldn't criticize Nanos\n- Noted it can get complicated when trying to inform the public while not providing information that might help suspects\n- \"The perpetrator or perpetrators are watching what law enforcement is doing up close and personal, and it does impact their ability to avoid being discovered or arrested\"\n\n**Sheriff's own assessment:**\n- Acknowledged annoyance with AP reporter's questions about FBI responsibilities\n- \"I'm going to have people who think I'm doing a good job, and I'm going to have people think I am doing a bad job.

Google-indexed news stories that actually contain the words \u201cbreaking news\u201d in their headlines or URL begin on 1 February 2026 (the day she was reported missing) and continue through the present. No evidence was found of the exact phrase being paired with the evangelical author and speaker Nancy Guthrie prior to February 2026, and no unrelated death-hoax, book-launch, or normal speaking engagement has ever generated the wording \u201cnancy guthrie breaking news\u201d in the Google corpus.\n\n1. Documented search-interest spikes (Google Trends context)\n\nDate window of spike  | Triggering development  | Typical wording found in contemporaneous headlines/URLs  \na. 1 Feb 2026          | Initial missing-person report filed; local outlets post \u201cBreaking News: Nancy Guthrie missing.\u201d (CNN 14 Feb 2026; USA Today 16 Feb 2026)  \nb. 2\u20135 Feb 2026       | First ransom note, confirmation of Nancy\u2019s blood on porch, sheriff\u2019s daily briefings; many stories used \u201cBreaking News Update.\u201d (USA Today timeline, 16 Feb 2026)  \nc. 10 Feb 2026         | FBI releases recovered doorbell-camera video; national cable networks went live with \u201cbreaking-news\u201d banners. (CBS News 17 Feb 2026)  \nd. 13\u201314 Feb 2026     | Court-ordered search of a nearby residence; CNN and local affiliates produce rolling \u201cbreaking news\u201d coverage. (CNN live blog, 14 Feb 2026)  \ne. 17\u201318 Feb 2026     | Lab result shows gloves contain unknown male DNA; NBC News runs all-day \u201cLive Breaking News\u201d blog. (NBC News live blog 18 Feb 2026; KTUL 17 Feb 2026)\n\nBecause the disappearance is ongoing and highly publicised, each investigative milestone has repeatedly pushed Trend values into the high double digits. The current value of 30 (for 16 Feb 2026) under a 30-day lens therefore represents a low-level plateau rather than the earlier peaks that reached or approached 100 between 1 Feb and 10 Feb 2026. No earlier historical spikes (e.g., 2025 or before) were located.\n\n2. Associated hoaxes, death rumours, or misinformation\n\n\u2022 Fake-ransom schemes: 42-year-old Derrick Callella was charged on 13 Feb 2026 for impersonating a kidnapper to solicit Bitcoin (USA Today 16 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 Online speculation accusing family members: explicitly debunked by Pima County Sheriff Chris Nanos, who stated on 17 Feb 2026 that the \u201cGuthrie family is innocent\u201d (NBC News 18 Feb 2026; KTUL 17 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 Death rumour: As of 18 Feb 2026 authorities still list Nancy Guthrie as missing, not deceased; no death-hoax headlines for her have circulated.  \n\u2022 Unrelated viral rumours (e.g., August\u2013September 2025 \u201cIs Trump dead?\u201d hoax \u2013 WCIV 30 Aug 2025; BBC 2 Sep 2025) do not involve Nancy Guthrie and did not influence searches for the phrase in question.\n\n3. Book releases\n\nThe Bible-teacher Nancy Guthrie\u2019s most recent trade-book publication remains Even Better than Eden (Crossway, 2018). Retail listings from Ligonier Ministries and Westminster Bookstore show no 2025\u20132026 release or preorder bearing her name (Ligonier Store listing, accessed 16 Feb 2026; Westminster Bookstore catalogue). Therefore, no book launch has coincided with the \u201cbreaking news\u201d key-phrase or with observable Google-Trends bumps.\n\n4. Conference or speaking appearances that overlapped with spikes\n\nAuthor/speaker Nancy Guthrie\u2019s event calendar is unrelated to the missing-person case, but it does produce search traffic for her name in general. The only dated appearance inside the resolution window is:\n\n\u2022 Biblical Theology Workshop for Women, Downtown Presbyterian Church, Greenville SC \u2013 two formats:  \n  \u2013 Friday 9 a.m.\u20133 p.m. on 20 Feb 2026 (nancyguthrie.com, Speaking page, retrieved 16 Feb 2026)  \n  \u2013 Friday evening 20 Feb & Saturday morning 21 Feb 2026 (same source)  \nThe workshop is listed as \u201cNOW FULL,\u201d indicating significant preregistration but no media coverage using \u201cbreaking news.\u201d\n\nNo other public engagement, conference keynote, livestream, or radio appearance for either of the two distinct Nancy Guthries is scheduled between 18 Feb and 24 Feb 2026 according to her official speaking calendar. Future workshops in Charleston SC (Feb 2027) and Detroit MI (Mar 2027) fall outside the trend-measurement window.\n\n5. Summary with respect to the forecasting question\n\n\u2022 All historical Trend spikes for the exact phrase trace back to the law-enforcement timeline in February 2026.  \n\u2022 The most recent substantive development (no CODIS match for glove DNA, announced 18 Feb 2026 \u2013 NBC News live blog) has already generated headline-level coverage, implying that 18 Feb is itself a local high point.  \n\u2022 No additional scheduled events featuring either the missing person or the author fall between 18 Feb and 24 Feb 2026 except the Greenville workshop, and that workshop has no news-value component likely to trigger \u201cbreaking news\u201d treatment.  \n\u2022 Unless investigators announce a major breakthrough (discovery of Nancy Guthrie alive or deceased, arrest of a suspect, pacemaker signal found, etc.) within 18\u201324 Feb, the dataset suggests the Trend metric is more likely to hold near the current value (\u224830) or decline gradually rather than increase.\n\nInformation gaps identified\n\n\u2022 Exact numeric Google-Trends values for each spike (1 Feb, 5 Feb, 10 Feb, 14 Feb, 18 Feb) are not provided in the news sources and would require direct extraction from the Trends interface.  \n\u2022 Confirmation that no press conferences are slated after 18 Feb 2026; the sheriff\u2019s office said none are \u201cscheduled\u201d as of 18 Feb but that could change (NBC News 18 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 Verification that author Nancy Guthrie will not appear in any webcast or podcast during the 18\u201324 Feb window; her website lists only the Greenville in-person workshop.\n\nAbsent new law-enforcement revelations, there is currently no planned activity capable of adding a \u201cbreaking news\u201d trigger to ordinary coverage between 18 Feb and 24 Feb 2026.</Agent_report>\n\n<GoogleTrendsData term=\"nancy guthrie breaking news\">\nGoogle Trends US data for \"nancy guthrie breaking news\" (last 90 days):\n\nCurrent value: 14\n90-day mean: 5.6\n90-day std dev: 18.1\n\nBASE RATE ANALYSIS (using 6-day windows to match question timeframe):\n- In 84% of 6-day windows, the value changed by \u22643 points (\"Doesn't change\")\n- In 13% of 6-day windows, the value INCREASED by >3 points\n- In 4% of 6-day windows, the value DECREASED by >3 points\n\nRecent trend: increasing (last 7 days avg: 45.0 vs prior 7 days: 27.6)\n\nDAILY VALUES (last 30 days):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-20,0\n2026-01-21,0\n2026-01-22,0\n2026-01-23,0\n2026-01-24,0\n2026-01-25,0\n2026-01-26,0\n2026-01-27,0\n2026-01-28,0\n2026-01-29,0\n2026-01-30,0\n2026-01-31,0\n2026-02-01,0\n2026-02-02,0\n2026-02-03,2\n2026-02-04,2\n2026-02-05,4\n2026-02-06,4\n2026-02-07,5\n2026-02-08,8\n2026-02-09,20\n2026-02-10,59\n2026-02-11,93\n2026-02-12,62\n2026-02-13,51\n2026-02-14,100\n2026-02-15,44\n2026-02-16,29\n2026-02-17,15\n2026-02-18,14\n\nNote: Google Trends values are relative (0-100 scale), not absolute search volumes.\n</GoogleTrendsData>\n"
