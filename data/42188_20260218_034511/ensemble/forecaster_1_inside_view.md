Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Majority Leader Steve Scalise (Feb 12, 2026)**: Congressional Republican source announcing House passage of SAVE America Act (S. 1383) on Feb 12, 2026. Factual on legislative action; includes public polling data (83% support photo ID). Opinion content clearly from Republican perspective. Quality: High for legislative facts, medium for advocacy claims.

**Votebeat (Feb 16, 2026)**: Independent journalism source by Nathaniel Rakich. Reports House passage Wednesday (Feb 12, 2026), 217 Republicans + 1 Democrat. Includes expert quotes from election officials (Steve Simon, Shenna Bellows) and advocacy groups. Factual on Senate filibuster requiring 60 votes. Quality: High - balanced reporting with identifiable expert sources.

**League of Women Voters**: Advocacy organization opposing SAVE Act suite. Identifies three bills but provides factual legislative details. Opinion-heavy but transparent about advocacy stance. Quality: Medium - useful for bill identification, but advocacy-focused.

**Politifact (Feb 16, 2026)**: Fact-checking source confirming House passage Feb 11, 2026 and Trump's Feb 13 Truth Social post. Rates promise as "Stalled" due to Senate outlook. Includes Brennan Center statistic (21+ million lack documents). Quality: High - fact-checking methodology with clear sourcing.

**NBC News (Feb 17, 2026)**: Reports 50 of 53 Republican senators now support the bill, with Collins as 50th. Notes Murkowski and McConnell have not signed on. Confirms 60-vote filibuster threshold. Includes Thune quote that filibuster elimination has "not even close" to enough votes. Quality: High - current legislative count with named sources.

**ACLU (undated, but post-House passage)**: Advocacy organization confirming House passage and Senate consideration pending. Cites Kansas precedent (30,000+ blocked, later struck down). Quality: Medium - factual on legislative status, advocacy-focused on impacts.

**AskNews Articles (Feb 15-18, 2026)**: Multiple sources confirming House passage Feb 11-12, 2026. Reader's Digest discusses student loan changes (different SAVE program - unrelated). Pennsylvania Capital-Star (Feb 17) and other sources confirm Senate outlook is unlikely due to filibuster. Quality: High for recent legislative status.

**Key Factual Consensus**:
- House passed SAVE America Act on Feb 11-12, 2026 (sources vary by one day, likely timezone differences)
- Current Google Trends value: 24 (Feb 18, 2026) down from peak of 100 on Feb 12
- Senate requires 60 votes; Republicans have 50-53 supporters but need 7-10 Democrats
- Senate Majority Leader Thune not supporting filibuster elimination
- No imminent Senate vote scheduled

**Critical Gap in Outside View**: The outside view analysis mentions State of the Union on Feb 24, 2026, but I cannot find this confirmed in any provided sources. This is a speculative catalyst that may not occur or may not mention the SAVE Act.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence**:
1. **Established decay pattern**: Google Trends shows consistent 6-day decay from 100→24 (Feb 12-18). Multiple data points confirm this trajectory. This strongly suggests continued decline absent new catalyst.
2. **Senate procedural barrier**: Multiple independent sources (NBC, Votebeat, Politifact) confirm 60-vote filibuster requirement and insufficient support. This reduces likelihood of imminent Senate action creating news spike.

**Moderate Evidence**:
1. **No scheduled Senate vote**: NBC reports Thune promised "a vote" but no specific date. Congress reconvenes Feb 23 per outside view, but no confirmation of immediate SAVE Act floor action.
2. **Natural search decay**: Post-legislative event patterns typically show 7-14 day decay to baseline unless new catalyst emerges.

**Weak Evidence**:
1. **SOTU catalyst (Feb 24)**: Outside view claims this is scheduled and Trump will mention SAVE Act, but no source confirms either the SOTU date or planned mention. This is speculative.
2. **Advocacy campaigns (Feb 22-24)**: Mentioned in outside view but not confirmed in sources. Minor impact even if occurring.

**Evidence Weight Summary**: Strong evidence points toward continued decay. The primary counterargument (SOTU spike) lacks source confirmation and is speculative.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: Feb 18 (today) → Feb 26 (8 days)
- Starting value: 24
- Resolution criteria: Compare Feb 26 value to Feb 18 value (24)
  - "Doesn't change": 21-27 (within ±3)
  - "Increases": >27 (+4 or more)
  - "Decreases": <21 (-4 or more)

**Current Trajectory**: 
- Feb 12-18 decay: 100→59→56→43→33→26→24
- Recent daily changes: -7, -3, -13, -10, -7, -2
- Decay rate slowing as approaching baseline (historical mean ~6.3)

**If timeframe halved (4 days to Feb 22)**:
- Continued decay likely reaches 18-22 range
- No major catalysts before Feb 22
- Higher probability of "Doesn't change" or "Decreases"

**If timeframe doubled (16 days to Mar 6)**:
- More time for Senate developments or new events
- Likely settles near baseline (6-10 range)
- Much higher probability of "Decreases"

**8-day window assessment**: Sufficient time for value to drop below 21 (decrease threshold) if decay continues at current 2-4 points/day. Would need significant catalyst to reverse trend and exceed 27.

## (d) Justification

**Base Rate from Outside View**: 
- 80% no change (≤3 points)
- 20% increase (>3 points)
- 0% decrease (>3 points)

However, this base rate includes many quiet periods. Current circumstances differ significantly:

**Current Context Differences**:
1. **Active decay phase**: We're 6 days post-major spike, not in a stable period. Historical pattern shows continued decay is normal.
2. **No confirmed near-term catalysts**: The SOTU on Feb 24 is unconfirmed in sources. Senate vote timing is uncertain.
3. **Structural barriers**: Senate filibuster makes legislative progress unlikely in the 8-day window.

**Factors Favoring "Decreases" (<21 by Feb 26)**:
- Strong momentum: 76-point drop over 6 days
- Mathematical trajectory: At 2-4 points/day decline, reaches 16-20 by Feb 26
- No confirmed catalysts to reverse trend
- Historical pattern: Post-legislative spikes typically decay 10-14 days before stabilizing

**Factors Favoring "Doesn't Change" (21-27 by Feb 26)**:
- Decay rate slowing as approaching baseline
- Possible minor news (Senate procedural votes, advocacy campaigns)
- Natural floor effect: Search interest rarely drops to zero immediately

**Factors Favoring "Increases" (>27 by Feb 26)**:
- Unconfirmed SOTU mention on Feb 24
- Potential Senate floor action (but no scheduled vote)
- Advocacy campaigns (unconfirmed)

**Critical Assessment**: The outside view's 45% "Increases" probability relies heavily on the Feb 24 SOTU catalyst, which is not confirmed in any provided source. Without this catalyst, the strong decay momentum and lack of near-term Senate action make "Decreases" more likely than the outside view suggests.

**Shift Justification**: I'm shifting significantly toward "Decreases" because:
1. The primary catalyst (SOTU) is unconfirmed speculation
2. Strong evidence of continued decay momentum
3. Senate procedural barriers reduce likelihood of news-generating events
4. 8-day window is sufficient for 4+ point decline at current trajectory

The reference class of "general 8-day windows" is less relevant than the specific reference class of "post-major-spike decay periods," which strongly favor continued decline.

## Probability Calibration

**Status Quo Continuation**: If current decay trend continues at 2-4 points/day, value reaches 16-20 by Feb 26 → **Decreases**

**Scenario Analysis**:

1. **Continued decay, no major catalyst (55% probability)**:
   - Decay continues at 2-3 points/day
   - Feb 26 value: 16-20
   - Outcome: **Decreases**

2. **Decay slows, minor news maintains interest (30% probability)**:
   - Decay slows to 0-1 points/day as approaching baseline
   - Minor Senate procedural news or advocacy campaigns
   - Feb 26 value: 20-24
   - Outcome: **Doesn't change**

3. **Major catalyst emerges (15% probability)**:
   - Unexpected Senate floor action or major Trump statement
   - Spike reverses decay temporarily
   - Feb 26 value: 28-40
   - Outcome: **Increases**

**Calibration Considerations**:
- 90% confidence (9:1 odds) would mean near-certainty of one outcome - not justified given uncertainty
- 70% confidence (7:3 odds) reflects strong but not overwhelming evidence
- Current evidence strongly favors "Decreases" but uncertainty about decay rate and potential minor catalysts warrants hedging

**Probability Distribution Reasoning**:
- "Decreases" (55%): Strong decay momentum, no confirmed catalysts, mathematical trajectory supports this
- "Doesn't change" (30%): Decay might slow near baseline, minor news could maintain 21-24 range
- "Increases" (15%): Requires unexpected catalyst; possible but not supported by current evidence

This represents a significant shift from outside view (45/30/25) to inside view (55/30/15), justified by:
1. Lack of source confirmation for Feb 24 SOTU catalyst
2. Strong evidence of decay momentum
3. Senate procedural barriers reducing near-term news likelihood

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Google Trends value for "save act" on Feb 26 be within 3 points of Feb 18 value (24), more than 3 higher, or more than 3 lower?

2. **Base rate**: Outside view: 45% Increases, 30% Doesn't change, 25% Decreases. My inside view shifts significantly toward Decreases due to unconfirmed SOTU catalyst and strong decay evidence.

3. **Consistency check**: Most likely = Decreases (55%); Least likely = Increases (15%). This aligns with strong decay momentum and lack of confirmed near-term catalysts.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - 6-day decay pattern: 100→24 (76 points) - validates continued decline
   - No confirmed Senate vote scheduled - reduces catalyst likelihood
   - SOTU Feb 24 unconfirmed in sources - primary "Increases" catalyst is speculative
   - Decay rate slowing near baseline - supports "Doesn't change" possibility
   - Senate filibuster barrier confirmed by multiple sources - reduces legislative news

5. **Blind-spot**: If Trump makes major SOTU announcement about SAVE Act on Feb 24 (unconfirmed), this could create 30-50 point spike, making "Increases" outcome likely. This would shift probabilities to roughly 60% Increases, 25% Doesn't change, 15% Decreases.

6. **Status quo**: Current trend is decay. Given 8-day window and 2-4 point/day decline rate, status quo strongly favors "Decreases." However, decay typically slows near baseline, so "Doesn't change" remains plausible.

7. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.
