Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**League of Women Voters (LWV)**: Advocacy organization opposing the SAVE Act suite of bills. Provides factual information about bill names and provisions but contains clear advocacy opinions. The source identifies three bills: SAVE Act (passed House in 2025), SAVE America Act, and Make Elections Great Again Act. Quality: Medium - factual on legislative details, but advocacy-focused.

**GovTrack.us (H.R. 7296)**: Legislative tracking website providing factual information about the SAVE America Act introduced January 30, 2026. High quality, neutral source with statistical projections about bill passage likelihood. No opinions, purely factual tracking data.

**Campaign Legal Center**: Advocacy organization opposing the bills. Claims 21+ million Americans lack required documents. Contains statistics but from an advocacy perspective. Quality: Medium - provides factual claims but with clear advocacy stance.

**ACLU Press Release**: Advocacy organization statement following House passage of SAVE America Act. Key factual claim: House passed the bill, now moves to Senate. Contains opinion from Xavier Persad (senior policy counsel). The press release states House passage occurred but doesn't specify the exact date in the excerpt. Quality: Medium - factual on legislative status, advocacy-focused on impact claims.

**Transportation.house.gov**: Press release about Water Resources Development Act hearing (Feb 24, 2026). Completely unrelated to SAVE Act - discusses water infrastructure. Quality: High for its topic, but irrelevant to this question.

**Senate Commerce Committee**: Hearing announcement about autonomous vehicles (Feb 4, 2026). Completely unrelated to SAVE Act. Quality: High for its topic, but irrelevant to this question.

**Agent Report**: Comprehensive synthesis identifying the SAVE Act as H.R. 22/SAVE America Act. Key factual claims:
- House passed bill 218-213 on **February 12, 2026**
- Congress on Presidents' Day recess Feb 18-22, 2026
- Senate reconvenes Feb 23, 2026
- President Trump's State of the Union address scheduled for **Feb 24, 2026**
- Advocacy campaigns planned for Feb 22-24, 2026
- Previous spikes: Apr 10, 2025 (first passage), Mar 25, 2025 (EO), Feb 12, 2026 (second passage)

Quality: High - synthesizes multiple sources with specific dates and legislative details.

**Google Trends Data**: Factual data showing:
- Current value (Feb 18): 24
- Peak on Feb 12: 100 (House passage date)
- Declining trend: 100→59→56→43→33→26→24 (Feb 12-18)
- Base rate: 80% of 8-day windows show ≤3 point change
- 20% show >3 point increase
- 0% show >3 point decrease

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Post-legislative-event decay patterns**
The SAVE Act just experienced a major news event (House passage on Feb 12, creating a value of 100). Historical pattern shows decay from peak: 100→59→56→43→33→26→24 over 6 days. This suggests continued decay is likely unless a new catalyst emerges.

**Reference Class 2: State of the Union address impact**
The President's SOTU address on Feb 24, 2026 is a known catalyst. If Trump mentions the SAVE Act (which supporters expect), this could reverse the decay trend and create a new spike.

**Reference Class 3: General 8-day window behavior**
Base rate from 90-day history: 80% no change (≤3 points), 20% increase (>3 points), 0% decrease (>3 points). However, this includes many quiet periods without major events.

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: A hybrid approach considering post-peak decay patterns modified by the scheduled SOTU catalyst on Feb 24.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: Feb 18 (today) to Feb 26 (8 days)
- Starting value: 24 (Feb 18)
- Resolution date: Feb 26
- Key event: SOTU address Feb 24 (6 days from now)

**Historical Patterns**:
- Feb 12 spike (100) followed by consistent daily decay
- Previous spikes (Apr 10, 2025; Mar 25, 2025) also showed similar decay patterns
- The 8-day decay from Feb 12-18 shows: 100→24 (76-point drop)
- Decay rate: approximately 12-13 points per day initially, slowing to 2-7 points per day recently

**Trajectory Analysis**:
Without intervention, continued decay would suggest Feb 26 value around 16-20 (continuing 2-4 point daily decline).

However, the SOTU on Feb 24 represents a significant potential catalyst. Historical precedent shows SOTU addresses create same-day search spikes for mentioned topics.

## (d) Justification

The question asks whether the value on Feb 26 will be within 3 points of Feb 18 (24), more than 3 points higher, or more than 3 points lower.

**Factors favoring "Decreases" (value <21 on Feb 26)**:
- Strong decay momentum from Feb 12 peak
- Congress on recess until Feb 23 (no immediate legislative action)
- Natural post-event decay pattern well-established
- If SOTU doesn't mention SAVE Act or mention is brief, decay continues

**Factors favoring "Doesn't change" (value 21-27 on Feb 26)**:
- Decay may slow as value approaches baseline (mean=6.3)
- Minor advocacy campaigns Feb 22-24 could maintain interest
- SOTU mention could create modest bump that returns to ~24 by Feb 26

**Factors favoring "Increases" (value >27 on Feb 26)**:
- SOTU address on Feb 24 with expected Trump endorsement
- Senate reconvenes Feb 23, potential floor action
- Advocacy campaigns timed for Feb 22-24
- Historical pattern: presidential mentions create sharp spikes
- Feb 26 is 2 days post-SOTU, potentially capturing the spike

**Critical Uncertainty**: Will Trump mention the SAVE Act in his SOTU, and if so, how prominently?

The base rate (80% no change) is misleading here because it includes many quiet periods. We're in an active news cycle with a scheduled major event.

Outside view calibration:

## (a) True Probability Calibration

I must avoid both overconfidence and excessive hedging. The SOTU on Feb 24 is a high-probability catalyst, but its impact magnitude is uncertain.

## (b) Established Distributions

The Google Trends base rate (80% no change, 20% increase, 0% decrease) reflects mostly quiet periods. However, we're currently in an active decay phase following a major spike, which changes the dynamics significantly.

## (c) Probability Granularity

- 90% confidence means 9:1 odds - very high certainty
- 70% confidence means 7:3 odds - strong but not overwhelming
- 50% confidence means even odds - maximum uncertainty

## (d) Domain Upset Rate

Political Google Trends are moderately predictable around scheduled events. SOTU addresses reliably generate search interest for mentioned topics, but:
- Uncertainty about whether SAVE Act will be mentioned
- Uncertainty about mention prominence
- Timing: Feb 26 is 2 days post-SOTU, which could capture the spike or miss it if spike occurs and decays quickly

**Calibration Logic**:

Given the decay trajectory (24 on Feb 18), without SOTU intervention, the value would likely reach 16-20 by Feb 26 (>3 point decrease).

However, the SOTU on Feb 24 has high probability of mentioning the SAVE Act (supporters expect it, it just passed House, Senate action pending). A SOTU mention typically creates a significant spike.

**Scenarios**:
1. Strong SOTU mention + media coverage (40% probability) → Spike to 40-70 range on Feb 24-25, settling to 30-50 by Feb 26 → **Increases**
2. Brief SOTU mention or no mention but continued advocacy (30% probability) → Modest bump or continued slow decay to 20-26 range → **Doesn't change**
3. No SOTU mention + decay continues (30% probability) → Value drops to 16-20 → **Decreases**

Increases: 45
Doesn't change: 30
Decreases: 25
