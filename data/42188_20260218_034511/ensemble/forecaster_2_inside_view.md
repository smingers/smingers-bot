Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (High Quality, Recent):**

1. **NBC News (Feb 17, 2026)**: Reports SAVE America Act has 50 Senate Republican supporters but faces 60-vote filibuster threshold. Collins becomes 50th supporter; Murkowski and McConnell haven't signed on. Thune warns against filibuster elimination. **Factual reporting with named sources.**

2. **Votebeat (Feb 16, 2026)**: Details House passage on Feb 12, 2026. Provides implementation concerns from election officials (Simon, Bellows). Notes Senate filibuster obstacle. **High-quality investigative journalism with expert sources.**

3. **Politifact (Feb 16, 2026)**: Confirms House passage Feb 11, 2026. Trump posted about it Feb 13. Rates promise as "Stalled." **Fact-checking organization, reliable dates.**

4. **Majority Leader Scalise (Feb 12, 2026)**: Official congressional source confirming House passage during week of Feb 9, 2026. Provides polling data (83% support voter ID). **Primary government source, factual on legislative action.**

5. **ACLU (undated but recent)**: Confirms House passage, moving to Senate. Advocacy position but factual on bill status. **Reliable on legislative facts.**

**AskNews Articles:**
- Multiple articles (Feb 15-18, 2026) confirm House passage and Senate consideration
- Reader's Digest (Feb 18): Discusses student loan SAVE plan - **completely different "SAVE" topic, not relevant**
- Several articles about SAVE America Act voting requirements (Feb 15-17, 2026) - confirm legislative status

**Key Factual Consensus:**
- House passed SAVE America Act between Feb 11-12, 2026
- Bill now in Senate, faces filibuster (needs 60 votes, Republicans have 53)
- Trump publicly supported it Feb 13, 2026
- Current date is Feb 18, 2026

**Critical Dating Issue:** The question opened Feb 18, 2026 at 02:35:08Z. The House passage occurred Feb 11-12, 2026, meaning the major news event is 6-7 days OLD at forecast opening.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **House passage timing (Feb 11-12)**: Multiple independent sources confirm this occurred 6-7 days before forecast window opens. Historical pattern shows Google Trends spikes occur within 1-3 days of major news, then decay rapidly. Current value of 24 (down from 36 on Feb 16) suggests the spike is already declining.

2. **Senate filibuster obstacle**: Multiple reliable sources (NBC, Votebeat, Politifact) confirm bill faces near-certain Senate blockage. Thune (Majority Leader) explicitly states no path to eliminating filibuster. This reduces likelihood of new major news events during forecast window.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **No scheduled Senate vote**: No sources indicate imminent Senate floor action during Feb 18-26 window. Senate typically moves slowly; bills can sit for weeks without action.

2. **Trump's Feb 13 post**: Already 5 days old by forecast opening. Any search spike from this would have occurred Feb 13-15, before our measurement window.

3. **Current trend direction**: Value dropped from 36 (Feb 16) to 24 (Feb 18 baseline) - a decline of 12 points over 2 days, suggesting decay phase after the House passage spike.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. Advocacy group campaigns (ACLU, LWV petitions) - these generate sustained low-level interest but rarely cause sudden spikes
2. State-level reactions - localized, unlikely to drive national Google Trends

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window:** Feb 18 → Feb 26 (8 days)

**Key temporal factors:**
- Major news event (House passage) occurred 6-7 days BEFORE forecast window opens
- Historical pattern: "save act" spikes to 80-100 within 1-2 days of major news, then decays back toward baseline within 5-7 days
- Current value (24) is in decay phase from the Feb 11-12 spike
- No scheduled catalysts during Feb 18-26 window

**If timeframe halved (4 days):** Would increase confidence in "Doesn't change" - less time for unexpected news
**If timeframe doubled (16 days):** Would slightly increase "Decreases" probability - more time for decay to baseline, possible new Senate developments

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside view base rates:** Increases 20%, Doesn't change 74%, Decreases 6%

**Key factors warranting adjustment:**

1. **Timing of major news relative to forecast window (Strong evidence):** The House passage - the type of event that historically drives spikes - occurred BEFORE our measurement window. The Feb 18 baseline value (24) already reflects post-spike decay. This is fundamentally different from the reference class, which includes windows where major news occurred DURING the 8-day period.

2. **Current decay trajectory (Moderate evidence):** Value dropped 12 points (36→24) in just 2 days (Feb 16→18), indicating active decay phase. If this decay continues at even half that rate, we'd see further decline.

3. **Absence of scheduled catalysts (Moderate evidence):** No Senate vote scheduled, filibuster makes passage unlikely. The reference class 20% "Increases" rate includes periods where House votes occurred mid-window. We have no comparable catalyst scheduled for Feb 18-26.

4. **Status quo if nothing changes:** Current decay trajectory suggests continued decline toward baseline (0-10 range where term historically sits). The value of 24 is elevated relative to the 90-day mean of 7.

**Adjustment rationale:**
- **Decrease probability should increase significantly** (from 6% to ~35%): We're in an active decay phase, major news is behind us, no new catalysts scheduled
- **Increase probability should decrease substantially** (from 20% to ~10%): Would require unexpected major news during window - possible but less likely than base rate suggests since we're past the primary news event
- **Doesn't change probability should decrease moderately** (from 74% to ~55%): While still most likely, the active decay makes a >3 point drop more probable than historical base rate

## Probability Calibration

**Status quo outcome:** Continued decay from current value of 24 toward historical baseline of 0-10. A decline of 5-10 points over 8 days would be consistent with observed decay rates.

**Most likely scenario:** Value on Feb 26 falls to 18-21 range (decrease of 3-6 points), triggering "Decreases" resolution. This reflects:
- Active decay from post-spike peak
- No scheduled news catalysts
- Historical pattern of rapid decay after major events

**Second most likely:** Value stays 21-27 (within ±3 of 24), triggering "Doesn't change." This requires decay to slow or stabilize, which is plausible if:
- Sustained advocacy/media coverage maintains baseline interest
- Value has already reached a temporary plateau

**Least likely:** Value increases above 27. Would require:
- Unexpected major Senate development (vote scheduled, filibuster drama)
- New Trump intervention or controversy
- Other unexpected news event

**Calibration check:**
- 90% confidence interval: Value on Feb 26 will be between 15-30
- 50% confidence interval: Value on Feb 26 will be between 18-24
- This supports "Decreases" as most likely, "Doesn't change" as second most likely

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Google Trends value for "save act" on Feb 26 be >3 higher (Increases), within ±3 (Doesn't change), or >3 lower (Decreases) than Feb 18 baseline of 24?

2. **Base rate:** Outside view: Increases 20%, Doesn't change 74%, Decreases 6%. My forecast shifts significantly toward "Decreases" because we're in post-spike decay phase, unlike most reference class windows.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = Decreases; Second = Doesn't change; Least = Increases. Makes sense given active decay from recent spike with no new catalysts scheduled.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - House passage occurred 6-7 days before forecast window (already reflected in baseline)
   - Value dropped 12 points in 2 days (Feb 16→18), indicating active decay
   - No Senate vote scheduled; filibuster makes passage unlikely during window
   - Historical pattern shows spikes decay within 5-7 days of news event
   - Current value (24) elevated vs 90-day mean (7), suggesting further decline likely

5. **Blind spot:** Unexpected Senate drama (surprise vote scheduling, filibuster showdown, major Trump pressure campaign) could trigger new spike. If this occurs, forecast would look silly. Probability ~10-15%.

6. **Status quo:** Active decay toward baseline. Given volatility of recent days and clear downward trajectory, status quo favors "Decreases" over "Doesn't change."

7. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.
