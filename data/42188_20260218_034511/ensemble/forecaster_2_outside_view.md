**Google Trends Data:**
- Current value (Feb 18): 24
- Massive spike on Feb 12 (value: 100) - corresponds to House passage
- Declining trend since peak: 100→59→56→43→33→26→24
- 90-day base rate: 80% of 8-day windows show ≤3 point change
- Recent 7-day average (48.7) much higher than prior period (10.9)
- Quality: High - objective data

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **All 8-day windows in past 90 days for "save act":**
   - 80% show ≤3 point change
   - 20% show >3 point increase
   - 0% show >3 point decrease
   - Suitability: Good baseline, but doesn't account for current context

2. **Post-major-news-event decay patterns:**
   - After Feb 12 spike (100), values declined: 59→56→43→33→26→24
   - Pattern shows steady decay from major news events
   - Suitability: Highly relevant - we're in a decay phase

3. **Periods with upcoming major political events:**
   - State of the Union addresses historically drive search spikes
   - Senate action on high-profile bills creates interest
   - Suitability: Very relevant - Feb 24 SOTU is within forecast window

**Most suitable reference class:** Combination of post-spike decay patterns with consideration of upcoming catalyzing events (SOTU, Senate action)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 8 days (Feb 18 → Feb 26)

**Key dates within window:**
- Feb 18-22: Congressional recess (low activity expected)
- Feb 23: Senate reconvenes
- Feb 24: State of the Union address (Trump expected to mention SAVE Act)
- Feb 22-24: Advocacy campaign peak
- Feb 23-26: Possible Senate floor action

**Historical patterns:**
- Current value (Feb 18): 24
- We're 6 days post-peak (Feb 12: 100)
- Decay rate: ~12-13 points per day initially, now ~2-3 points per day
- If decay continues: Feb 26 value could be ~18-20
- If SOTU creates spike: Could jump to 40-60+ on Feb 24-25

**Similar 8-day periods:**
- Most 8-day windows (80%) show ≤3 point change in normal times
- But we're NOT in normal times - we're in post-major-event period with another major event pending

## (d) Justification

**Baseline scenario (no SOTU effect):**
The natural decay from the Feb 12 spike would continue. Current value is 24; at current decay rate (~2-3 points/day), we'd expect Feb 26 to be around 18-22, representing a decrease of 2-6 points - likely triggering "Decreases" outcome.

**SOTU catalyst scenario:**
State of the Union addresses are historically powerful search drivers. If Trump mentions SAVE Act on Feb 24 (highly expected per agent report), this could create a same-day or next-day spike. Even a modest spike to 35-40 would represent an increase of >3 points from Feb 18 baseline (24), triggering "Increases" outcome.

**Senate action scenario:**
If Senate takes up the bill Feb 23-26, this could sustain or increase interest, though likely less dramatically than SOTU.

**Key tension:** Natural decay vs. catalyzing events

The question asks about the value on Feb 26 compared to Feb 18 (24). The SOTU on Feb 24 gives 2 days for any spike to manifest in the Feb 26 data point. Historical precedent strongly suggests presidential mentions in major addresses drive immediate search interest.

**Critical insight:** The question's resolution date (Feb 26) is strategically positioned 2 days after the SOTU, maximizing the chance that any SOTU-driven spike will be captured.

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring considerations:**
- Base rate (80% no change) is from normal periods, not post-spike with major event pending
- The 20% historical increase rate likely underweights the SOTU effect
- Zero historical decreases in 8-day windows seems anomalous given current decay

**Probability distribution reasoning:**

1. **"Increases" (>3 points above 24 = >27):**
   - SOTU mention is highly likely (per agent report)
   - Presidential addresses historically drive search spikes
   - Even partial recovery from decay would achieve this
   - Advocacy campaigns also timed for this window
   - Probability: 60-70%

2. **"Doesn't change" (21-27 range):**
   - Requires either: (a) SOTU effect exactly balances decay, or (b) no SOTU mention and decay slows
   - Narrow 6-point window makes this less likely
   - Probability: 15-25%

3. **"Decreases" (<21):**
   - Requires continued decay AND no SOTU effect
   - Would need Trump to not mention SAVE Act or mention to have no impact
   - Possible but contradicts agent report expectations
   - Probability: 10-20%

**Calibration check:**
- Am I overconfident in SOTU effect? Historical precedent is strong
- Could decay be faster than expected? Possible, but rate has already slowed
- Could SOTU not mention it? Agent report suggests high likelihood, but not certain

**Final calibration:** Given the specific timing of SOTU 2 days before resolution and strong historical precedent for presidential address effects, I weight "Increases" heavily but maintain meaningful probability for other outcomes given uncertainty.

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 65%
Doesn't change: 20%
Decreases: 15%
