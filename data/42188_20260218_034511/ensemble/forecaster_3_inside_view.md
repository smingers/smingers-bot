1) Resolution criteria / options (paraphrase, <30 words)  
From Google Trends US (fixed range 2026-01-27 to 2026-02-26), compare “save act” values on 2026-02-18 vs 2026-02-26: >3 up=Increases, within ±3=Doesn’t change, >3 down=Decreases.

(a) Source analysis (summary, quality, date)

- MajorityLeader.gov (Scalise press item), 2026-02-12: Republican leadership write-up celebrating House passage and arguing for voter ID/proof-of-citizenship. Factual status cues are useful; heavy partisan framing. Quality: medium for status, low for impact claims.  
- Votebeat, 2026-02-16: Detailed explainer on the SAVE America Act logistics and Senate hurdles; quotes identifiable election officials. Quality: high-medium; some interpretive framing but strong reporting.  
- League of Women Voters (lwv.org), undated webpage: Advocacy urging opposition; contains some factual bill taxonomy but primarily persuasion. Quality: medium-low (facts usable, impact claims partisan).  
- PolitiFact, mid-Feb 2026: “Stalled” framing; discusses House action and low Senate prospects; cites Brennan Center stats. Quality: medium-high (status/fact-check orientation).  
- NBC News, 2026-02-17: Reports at least 50 Senate supporters, filibuster barrier, Thune promising a vote; quotes Collins/Thune/Schumer/Murkowski. Quality: high for near-term procedural signals.  
- ACLU press release, mid-Feb 2026: Advocacy condemning House passage; factual “passed House, to Senate” is reliable; impact estimates are advocacy-selected. Quality: medium for status, medium-low for magnitude claims.  
- AskNews:  
  - Pennsylvania Capital-Star/Votebeat syndication, 2026-02-17: Same core story as Votebeat; reinforces continued media attention. Quality: medium-high.  
  - Various local/state pieces (al.com, KGNS, Yahoo), 2026-02-16: Localized coverage of House passage and state reactions; good for breadth of attention but individually not decisive. Quality: medium.  
  - Reader’s Digest, 2026-02-18: Student-loan “SAVE plan” changes; relevant mainly as potential *confounder* for “SAVE” searches, but query here is “save act”. Quality: medium; relevance uncertain.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution)

Strong evidence
- Continuing national political trigger likely within window: NBC (2/17) says leadership promised a Senate vote; Senate procedural drama tends to create discrete search bumps. Clear causal mechanism: major vote/filibuster showdown → headlines → searches.  
- We are still in the “aftershock” of a recent peak (House passage) with multiple outlets continuing coverage (NBC, Votebeat, PolitiFact, ACLU/LWV advocacy pushes). This raises baseline volatility versus a normal week.

Moderate evidence
- Local/state coverage breadth (al.com, KGNS, Yahoo) suggests the topic is being refracted through many local news ecosystems, which can sustain search interest rather than letting it decay monotonically.  
- Advocacy mobilization (LWV/ACLU/petition) can add marginal search volume, especially around Senate consideration.

Weak evidence
- Student-loan “SAVE” news (Reader’s Digest) could create noise, but the query is “save act” (not “SAVE plan”), so spillover is uncertain and likely small.

Net implication for the 2/18→2/26 change test:  
- Status-quo decay pushes toward “Decreases”.  
- A Senate-floor event (vote attempt / cloture failure / high-profile speeches) pushes toward “Increases”, and it doesn’t need to be huge to clear the +3 threshold.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Forecast window: 8 days (from today 2026-02-18 to 2026-02-26).  
- If halved (~4 days): decay dominates more (less time for Senate action to land and diffuse into searches) → higher “Decreases”.  
- If doubled (~16 days): greater chance of another political inflection (vote, court action, major presidential messaging) → higher “Increases” and lower “Doesn’t change”.

(d) Justification: updating the outside view
Outside view base rates (given): Increases 65 / Doesn’t change 20 / Decreases 15.

Inside-view adjustments:
- I slightly discount the outside-view’s heavy reliance on a specific major-address catalyst (not directly evidenced in the provided current articles), and I increase weight on “continued decay unless the Senate produces a headline very near 2/26.”  
- However, NBC’s “Thune promised a vote” plus broad ongoing coverage makes a nontrivial late-window bump plausible, and the +3 threshold is modest.

So: reduce “Increases” a bit from 65, increase “Decreases” meaningfully, keep “Doesn’t change” around ~20 given the narrow ±3 band and inherent day-to-day noise.

Probability calibration

- Status quo continuation (no new major Senate moment): likely continued cooling from the House-passage spike → “Decreases” becomes quite plausible.  
- Yes-trigger for “Increases”: any prominent Senate procedural confrontation or vote attempt late in the window that lifts 2/26 above 2/18 by >3.  
- “Doesn’t change”: requires a fairly specific offset (small bump that lands within ±3), which is less robust than either directional move.

Checklist:
1) Criteria aligned: compare 2/18 vs 2/26 on the specified fixed-range Trends page; ±3 = Doesn’t change, otherwise direction.  
2) Outside-view distribution used: [65, 20, 15].  
3) Consistency check: Most likely = Increases; least likely = Doesn’t change; yes, given volatility + discrete-news risk.  
4) Key evidence (most significant):  
   - NBC (2/17): Senate leadership promises a vote; procedural drama can spike searches.  
   - Multiple outlets (2/16–2/18) still covering the bill; attention hasn’t fully dissipated.  
   - Post-peak decay trend creates real pull toward “Decreases” absent new catalysts.  
   - ±3 threshold is small; modest news can flip outcome.  
5) Blind spot: If there’s *no* Senate-floor moment and media attention shifts sharply to other events, searches could keep sliding and “Decreases” wins comfortably.  
6) Status quo nudge: applied—raised “Decreases” vs outside view.  
7) Technicalities: probabilities 0–100, sum to 100.
