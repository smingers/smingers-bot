Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological, 12–18 Feb 2026)  
1. MajorityLeader.gov press release (12 Feb).  Primary source confirming House passage of the SAVE America Act; factual vote counts, partisan framing. Good for legislative facts; opinion discount.  
2. NBC News (17 Feb).  Mainstream outlet; confirms 50 Senate supporters, filibuster hurdle. Reliable, recent.  
3. Votebeat / Pennsylvania-Capital-Star (17 Feb).  Specialist outlet on election admin; quotes state election officials. Moderate-to-high quality for implementation concerns.  
4. Politifact (updated 11 Feb).  Fact-check service; details bill provisions and Senate odds. High quality, neutral.  
5. ACLU, League of Women Voters (15–17 Feb).  Advocacy press releases; useful only for timeline confirmation and scale of potential impact.  
6. AskNews list – several local TV / Yahoo / Breitbart items dated 16–17 Feb repeating the same “House passed, Senate next” storyline; quality varies but all corroborate that the bill is saturating general-interest news right now.  
7. Reader’s Digest, JD Supra, tax-law, student-loan pieces (17–18 Feb) mention other “SAVE” acronyms unrelated to voting.  Low relevance but signal that “save act” searches can be partially contaminated by other legislation.

(b) Evidence analysis (relative to a >3-point up/down Google-Trends move by 26 Feb)  
Strong:  
• Structural – Senate action is procedurally required next; even a failed cloture attempt would re-enter news cycle.  
• Historical – Google-Trends 90-day data show 20 % of all 8-day windows ended >3 points higher, 0 % ended >3 lower.  
Moderate:  
• Momentum decay – after a 12 Feb peak (100), the value had already fallen to 36 by 16 Feb, implying a downward slope that could breach the –3 threshold within eight days.  
• Media saturation – the past week produced dozens of stories; volume usually wanes within 7–10 days unless refreshed by a new event.  
Weak:  
• Other “SAVE” acronyms (student-loan plan, DUAA data act) may create background noise, but historically their search volume is much smaller than the voting bill.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon: 8 days (18 → 26 Feb 2026).  If horizon were halved to 4 days, volatility would fall and “no change” would gain ~6 pp.  If doubled to 16 days, headline-decay odds rise; “decrease” would gain ~8 pp at the expense of “no change.”

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
1. Baseline (outside view) = [18 / 72 / 10].  
2. Current value (≈ mid-30s) sits on the shoulder of a sharp post-peak decline; purely mechanical decay of search interest over eight days would on average lower the value by ~8–12 points, easily clearing the –3 threshold.  (Moderate → shifts 15 pp from “no change” to “decrease.”)  
3. Senate choreography: Majority Leader Thune has promised a vote, and pro-/anti-filibuster theatrics could occur any day; even floor speeches without a vote often spark another short search spike.  Gives the “increase” bucket additional 7 pp drawn from “no change.”  
4. Noise / scale-recalibration: Daily values swing ±2 to 3 points routinely; that cushions both tails and returns some weight to the middle (+3 pp to “no change”).  
5. Black-swan humility: preserve ≥5 pp for each non-modal outcome.

Probability calibration  
Starting 18/72/10 → apply shifts:  
• –32 pp from “no change” (+15 to “decrease”; +7 to “increase”; +10 retained as uncertainty split).  
• +7 pp “increase” for Senate event risk.  
• +3 pp “no change” back for scale noise.  
Rounded:

Increases: 25  
Doesn’t change: 40  
Decreases: 35

------------------------ FORECASTING CHECKLIST ------------------------
1. Options/criteria: Compare Google-Trends value for “save act” on 26 Feb to 18 Feb; >+3 = Increases, within ±3 = Doesn’t change, <–3 = Decreases.  
2. Outside-view distribution: [18, 72, 10].  
3. Consistency: Most likely = Doesn’t change (40 %); Least = tie marginally between Increase (25 %) & Decrease (35 %)? — yes, matches reasoning.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • Post-12 Feb spike already halved by 16 Feb (decay trend).  
   • Senate promises a vote “soon,” may rekindle attention.  
   • 90-day data: 20 % >+3 moves, 0 % >–3 moves.  
   • Eight-day horizon short; typical rescaling noise ±2–3 points.  
   • Other “SAVE” acronyms supply minor background traffic.  
5. Blind-spot: A surprise Senate filibuster drama on 24–25 Feb floods social media, pushing the value back above 40 and making “increase” the clear outcome.  
6. Status quo: Google-Trends often drifts slowly; the elevated starting point argues for some fall but random noise favours “no change.”  
7. Technicalities: Probabilities sum to 100, no percent signs.

Probabilities: [25, 40, 35]
