You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “save act” change between 2026-02-18 and 2026-02-26 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “save act” at the time of writing this question (Feb 16, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 36; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=save%20act&date=2026-01-17%202026-02-16).

`{"format":"trends_interest_change_magnitude","info":{"topic":"save act","trend_start":"2026-02-18","trend_end":"2026-02-26","verification_url":"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=save%20act&date=2026-01-27%202026-02-26"}}`

The options are: ['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves “Doesn't change” if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=save%20act&date=2026-01-27%202026-02-26](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=save%20act&date=2026-01-27%202026-02-26) for 2026-02-26 is within 3 of the value at 2026-02-18. It resolves “Increases” if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves “Decreases” if the value is more than 3 lower.

# Summary of Article: "Tell Congress to oppose the SAVE Act Suite of bills"

**Source:** League of Women Voters (Lwv)

## Key Facts and Legislative Details:

1. **Legislative Activity:** Congress has introduced multiple bills in the 119th Congress requiring documentary proof of citizenship (DPOC) for voter registration and/or voting.

2. **Three Major Bills Identified:**
   - **The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act:** Passed the House in 2025; requires citizenship documentation to register to vote
   - **The SAVE America Act:** Contains stricter requirements than the SAVE Act
   - **The Make Elections Great Again Act:** Also contains stricter requirements than the SAVE Act
   
3. **Stricter Requirements in Newer Bills:** The SAVE America Act and Make Elections Great Again Act require:
   - DPOC presentation at both registration AND the polls
   - Absentee ballots to be received by election day

4. **Groups Identified as Potentially Burdened:**
   - **Military voters:** Would need to present documentation each time they re-register when moving
   - **Natural disaster victims:** Would need to replace lost documents while rebuilding
   - **People who changed names:** Would need updated documentation
   - **People of color:** Cited as three times more likely than white citizens to lack required documents or face difficulties accessing them
   - **Black Americans specifically:** Two-thirds do not possess a passport (compared to approximately half of all American adults)

## Opinion (from advocacy organization):
The League of Women Voters argues that these requirements are unnecessary (noting it's already illegal for noncitizens to vote in federal/state elections) and would create barriers to voting for eligible voters.

# Summary of Article: "What You Need to Know About the SAVE Act"

**Source:** Campaign Legal Center

**Key Facts and Claims:**

1. **Legislation Overview:** The article discusses two similar bills in Congress - the SAVE America Act and the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act. According to the source, these bills are "fundamentally the same" despite different names.

2. **Documentation Requirements:**
   - The bills would require voters to provide additional documentation beyond current requirements when registering to vote
   - **Statistic cited:** More than 21 million Americans are unable to access the additional documents that would be required under these bills
   - Most voters would not be able to register with their driver's license alone, as licenses generally don't indicate citizenship
   - Alternative documents required would include U.S. passports or birth certificates
   - Documentation would be required when updating registration (address changes, party changes)

3. **National Voter ID Requirement:** The SAVE America Act would implement a national voter ID requirement described as "more burdensome than almost every single state voter ID law currently in effect"

4. **Impact on Registration Methods:**
   - **Statistics cited (2022):** More than 7 million Americans registered to vote by mail; almost 11 million registered online
   - The bills would "severely threaten mail registration" and require online registration systems to be overhauled

5. **Voter Purges:** Both bills would mandate frequent voter purges based on what the source characterizes as "faulty data"

6. **Criminal Penalties:** Election workers could face up to five years in prison for helping register someone without correct documents, even if the registered voter is a citizen

7. **Data Sharing Requirements:** The SAVE America Act would require all states to submit voter registration lists to the Department of Homeland Security for comparison to the agency's database (described by the source as "error-ridden")

**Note:** This article is an advocacy piece from the Campaign Legal Center opposing these bills. The statistics and claims presented reflect the organization's perspective and analysis rather than a neutral assessment.

# Summary of ACLU Article on SAVE America Act

## Key Facts and Developments:

1. **Legislative Status**: The U.S. House of Representatives has passed the SAVE America Act, which now moves to the U.S. Senate for consideration.

2. **Main Provisions of the Bill**:
   - Imposes new burdensome requirements related to voter registration processes
   - Expands federal involvement in state election administration
   - Requires passports or birth certificates to register to vote or update voter registration information
   - Imposes restrictive photo ID requirements to vote
   - Forces states to engage in voter roll purges
   - Requires states to turn over Americans' private voter data to the U.S. Department of Homeland Security

3. **Estimated Impact Statistics**:
   - An estimated 21 million eligible voters don't have ready access to required documents (passports or birth certificates)
   - As many as 69 million women who have changed their name due to marriage would face additional hurdles

4. **Historical Precedent Cited**:
   - Kansas previously enacted a documentary proof-of-citizenship law
   - That law blocked more than 30,000 eligible voters from registering to vote
   - The Kansas law was later struck down for violating the National Voter Registration Act and U.S. Constitution

5. **Related Context**:
   - The SAVE America Act is described as similar to the Make Elections Great Again (MEGA) Act
   - Both are described as more extreme attempts to enact provisions of the SAVE Act
   - Ongoing legal disputes exist between the federal government and several states concerning access to voter records and election data
   - The Trump Administration has sought expanded access to sensitive voter information
   - Federal agents raided an election center in Fulton County, Georgia

## Opinions from Named Source:

**Xavier Persad, senior policy counsel for ACLU's National Political Advocacy Department**, stated:
- The SAVE America Act is "another thinly veiled attempt to interfere with our elections"
- There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud that justifies the requirements
- Laws like this have historically resulted in eligible citizens being delayed or denied ballot access due to paperwork issues, database mismatches, or bureaucratic error
- Called the bill and similar efforts "attempts to distract from these federal abuses of power while silencing voters"
- Urged the Senate to reject the bill

The article identifies disproportionate impacts on: voters with low incomes, naturalized citizens, voters of color, rural voters, older voters, young voters, and transgender voters.

<Agent_report>
Query: Identify what legislation or programs are currently labelled "SAVE Act" in the US, list any scheduled congressional actions, agency rule deadlines, or advocacy campaigns occurring 18–26 Feb 2026, and summarize prior high-interest news moments tied to those events.
Current U.S. measures commonly referred to as “SAVE Act”

1. Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act  
   • Bill number: H.R. 22, 119th Congress (Rep. Chip Roy, R-TX-21) (GovTrack).  
   • Core provisions: amends the National Voter Registration Act to require documentary proof of U.S. citizenship to register for federal elections; establishes criminal penalties for election officials who register an applicant without that proof; directs states to run intensified voter-roll maintenance; authorises private rights of action.  
   • Legislative status:  
     – First cleared the House on 10 Apr 2025 (GovTrack).  
     – Re-introduced with an added national photo-ID section and re-branded by House GOP leadership as the “SAVE America Act”, but press, advocates, and many databases still shorthand it as the “SAVE Act” (BBC, Federal News Network).  
     – Passed the House again, 218-213, on 12 Feb 2026 and sent to the Senate (NonStop Local Montana; LDF).  
   • Political context: Heavily backed by former President Trump and conservative groups such as Heritage Action and the Only Citizens Vote Coalition (Rep. Roy press release). Opposed by the League of Women Voters, NAACP Legal Defense Fund, Campaign Legal Center and a broad civil-rights coalition (LWV; LDF; CLC).

No other federal bill or federal program presently active in the 119th Congress is using the “SAVE Act” label in official or advocacy materials. Earlier measures that once bore that acronym (e.g., the 2015 Stop Advertising Victims of Exploitation Act or the Sensible Accounting to Value Energy Act) have not been re-introduced this Congress and are absent from current calendars. Likewise, the Biden-era student-loan “SAVE” income-driven repayment plan is a regulation, not an “Act”, and is now being replaced by the new RAP program under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act; it is rarely searched solely as “save act” (JD Supra; JC Post).

Scheduled activity, 18 – 26 Feb 2026

Congressional calendar
• 18-22 Feb 2026 – Both chambers on Presidents-Day recess; no floor action (Federal News Network).  
• 23 Feb 2026 (Monday) – House and Senate reconvene. Senate Republican sponsors hope to bring up the SAVE Act/SAVE America Act; discussions continue over whether to test the 60-vote cloture rule or stage a talking filibuster (Federal News Network). As of 16 Feb, no cloture petition or unanimous-consent agreement has been filed.  
• 23-27 Feb 2026 – Eight unrelated bills are listed on the House floor calendar for the week of 23 Feb; the SAVE Act is not among them because it has already passed that chamber (GovTrack floor-calendar note).

Possible parliamentary windows
• Senate “morning business” on 23-24 Feb could be used to place the SAVE Act on the calendar under Rule XIV, allowing a cloture filing late 24 Feb and a first possible cloture vote on 26 Feb. Leadership has not committed to this sequence but several conservative senators have said they will press for it, especially if the President touts the bill in his address (Federal News Network).

Executive-branch and agency deadlines
• None of the federal rule-making dockets captured in the search results list a statutory or regulatory deadline tied to 18-26 Feb 2026 that bears on the SAVE Act. The student-loan regulatory timeline, the DHS partial-shutdown negotiations, and other cited agency issues fall outside the requested window or relate to different statutes (JD Supra; Federal News Network).

Advocacy and public-campaign events
• 18-26 Feb – League of Women Voters maintains its “Tell Congress to Oppose the SAVE Act Suite” digital call-in campaign and has alerted members to focus on senators during the first week back (LWV).  
• 18-26 Feb – Only Citizens Vote Coalition and Heritage Action plan a “Secure Our Elections” phone-bank and social-media push aimed at persuading seven targeted Democratic senators to back cloture; the coalition has announced 22-24 Feb as its national action days (Rep. Roy press release).  
• 24 Feb – President Trump’s State of the Union address. Supporters expect him to urge the Senate to pass the SAVE Act; opponents plan to spotlight potential disenfranchisement during response events (Federal News Network; BBC).

Prior high-interest news moments that drove Google-search spikes for “save act”

1. 10 Apr 2025 – First House passage (H.R. 22) generated national coverage and a noticeable Google Trends peak.  
2. 25 Mar 2025 – Trump executive order previewing documentary-proof requirements created a secondary spike (NCSL article referencing the EO).  
3. 12 Feb 2026 – Second House passage, re-branded as SAVE America Act, produced front-page stories across major outlets (BBC; NonStop Local Montana; LDF).  
4. 12-13 Feb 2026 – Immediate civil-rights–group reactions and threat-of-filibuster stories added to the search volume (LDF; Campaign Legal Center).  
5. Anticipated: 24 Feb 2026 – State of the Union address is historically a catalyst for sharp, same-day increases in search interest for legislative priorities mentioned by the president.

Assessment of information gaps
• The Senate’s precise floor schedule for the week of 23 Feb remains unpublished; confirmation is needed on whether the SAVE Act will actually be laid before the Senate or simply placed on the calendar.  
• No advocacy coalition has yet published a confirmed in-person rally schedule for the Capitol between 23-26 Feb; only virtual actions are documented.  
• Real-time Google Trends data for “save act” on 18 Feb 2026 (baseline value) and forecasts for 26 Feb cannot be accessed within the provided sources and will need to be checked on the Google Trends interface when those dates arrive.

Taken together, the only currently active item formally labelled “SAVE Act” in the United States is the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act (aka SAVE America Act). All scheduled legislative, advocacy, and potential news-making events between 18 Feb and 26 Feb 2026 revolve around this voting-eligibility bill, with its fate in the Senate and its expected mention in the State of the Union serving as the principal triggers that could move Google-search interest during the forecast window.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
