Disagreement Analysis:

**Disagreement 1: Whether the post-spike decay will continue or has already stabilized**
- Forecasters 1 and 2 strongly favor "Decreases" (55% and 35% respectively), believing the decay from the House passage spike (~100 → 24) will continue below 21 by Feb 26.
- Forecasters 3 and 4 favor "Increases" (58%) or "Doesn't change" (58%), believing either a new catalyst will boost interest or the value has stabilized near baseline.
- Forecaster 5 is in the middle (40% Doesn't change, 35% Decreases).
- This is the largest driver of disagreement, swinging predictions from "Decreases most likely" to "Increases most likely."

**Disagreement 2: Whether a Senate vote or major Senate action on the SAVE Act will occur during Feb 18-26**
- Forecaster 3 gives 58% to "Increases," heavily influenced by NBC reporting that Senate Majority Leader Thune "promised a vote" and the possibility of a filibuster confrontation generating a new search spike.
- Forecasters 1 and 2 discount this, noting the filibuster barrier and no confirmed Senate vote scheduled during the window. Forecaster 1 specifically notes "Senate procedural barriers reducing near-term news likelihood."
- This factual question about Senate scheduling is the key driver of the Increases vs. Decreases split.

**Disagreement 3: Whether a State of the Union or major presidential address is scheduled around Feb 24**
- Forecaster 1 references an "unconfirmed SOTU catalyst" on Feb 24 as a potential driver but discounts it due to lack of source confirmation.
- Forecaster 3's outside view initially gave 65% to Increases partly based on a "major-address catalyst."
- Other forecasters don't mention SOTU at all.
- If confirmed, this could significantly boost the "Increases" probability.

Root Causes:

1. **Decay vs. stabilization**: Different weighting of the same evidence (decay trend vs. baseline floor effects) combined with different base rate assumptions about how Google Trends values behave near low levels.

2. **Senate vote timing**: Different factual beliefs about whether a Senate vote or procedural action is scheduled during the Feb 18-26 window. This is verifiable.

3. **SOTU/presidential address**: Different factual beliefs about whether a State of the Union address is scheduled around Feb 24, 2026. This is verifiable.
