Resolution of Disagreements:

**Disagreement 1 (Decay vs. stabilization):** The research confirms the SAVE America Act passed the House on Feb 11, 2026, and the current Google Trends value as of Feb 16 is 36 (with the Feb 18 value estimated around 24 based on forecaster analysis). The decay from the spike is well-documented. However, the research doesn't definitively tell us whether the value has stabilized or will continue declining. This remains partially unresolved but the decay trend is clear.

**Disagreement 2 (Senate vote scheduling):** RESOLVED. The research clearly shows that as of Feb 18, 2026, **no cloture motion has been filed, no motion to proceed has been made, and no floor vote has been scheduled**. Thune has promised a vote but has not set a date. The Senate calendar for the week of Feb 17 lists other business (DHS appropriations, nominations) but no SAVE Act action. The earliest a cloture vote could occur if filed immediately would be the week of Feb 24, but that week is compressed by the State of the Union. This supports forecasters 1 and 2 who discounted Senate action during the window, and undermines forecaster 3's heavy weighting on Senate drama.

**Disagreement 3 (State of the Union):** RESOLVED. The SOTU is **confirmed for February 24, 2026 at 9 PM ET**. This is a real catalyst that falls within the Feb 18-26 window. If Trump mentions the SAVE Act during the SOTU, it could generate a search spike on Feb 24-25 that would show up in the Feb 26 value. However, there's no guarantee Trump will emphasize this topic specifically, and even if he does, the spike would need to be large enough to push the Feb 26 value more than 3 points above the Feb 18 value.

Updated Analysis:

The key findings are:
1. **No Senate action is imminent** - This significantly reduces the probability of a Senate-driven search spike during the window. Forecaster 3's 58% for "Increases" was heavily predicated on Senate drama that is unlikely to materialize.

2. **SOTU is confirmed for Feb 24** - This is a genuine potential catalyst. Trump could mention the SAVE Act, election integrity, or voter ID during the address. However: (a) SOTU covers many topics, (b) even if mentioned, the search term "save act" may not spike dramatically since people might search for broader terms, (c) the spike would need to overcome the ongoing decay trend.

3. **Decay trend is strong** - The value dropped from ~100 to ~24 in about 6 days. Even with decay slowing near baseline, the Feb 18 starting value (~24) is still elevated compared to the 90-day mean (~7), suggesting further decline is likely.

4. **The ±3 threshold matters** - If Feb 18 value is ~24, "Doesn't change" means Feb 26 is 21-27. Given the decay trend, values of 18-20 (Decreases) are quite plausible. An SOTU mention could push it to 28+ (Increases).

Balancing these factors:
- The confirmed absence of Senate action reduces "Increases" probability significantly from forecaster 3's estimate
- The confirmed SOTU provides a modest but real upside catalyst, keeping "Increases" non-trivial
- The decay trend favors "Decreases" but the value is approaching baseline where decay slows
- "Doesn't change" is plausible if the value settles in the low 20s and stays there, or if a small SOTU bump offsets continued decay

I'm shifting the weighted average to reduce "Increases" (since the main catalyst - Senate action - is not scheduled) while keeping it meaningful (SOTU is confirmed), and increasing "Decreases" slightly given the strong decay momentum and no confirmed near-term legislative catalyst.

Confidence: MEDIUM

The research resolved two of three key disagreements clearly (Senate scheduling and SOTU date), but the ultimate outcome still depends on whether Trump mentions the SAVE Act in the SOTU and how quickly the decay trend continues.

Probabilities: [23, 38, 39]
