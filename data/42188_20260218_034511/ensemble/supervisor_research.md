# Summary of Article: Rep. Gill Leads RSC Members in Urging Senate to Mark Up SAVE Act

**Source:** Representative Brandon Gill  
**Date:** February 2, 2026

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- Congressman Brandon Gill (TX-26) is leading Republican Study Committee (RSC) members in an effort to force a markup on the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act
- The letter is addressed to Senate Rules Committee Chairman Mitch McConnell, calling on him to schedule an immediate markup
- Nearly 300 days have passed since the House passed the SAVE Act
- The legislation remains stalled in the Senate with no committee markup scheduled
- The SAVE Act passed the House with bipartisan support
- The bill has nearly unanimous backing among Senate Republicans
- The letter has 34 cosigners (list of representatives provided in article)
- The timeline reference indicates this is during the 119th Congress, already a full year into it

## Statements from Named Sources:

**Rep. Brandon Gill:** "American elections should be fair and free, not subject to foreign influence. Illegal aliens have no right to be in America, and they certainly shouldn't be voting. House Republicans are united behind the SAVE Act. I urge my Senate colleagues to pass this legislation and get it to President Trump's desk for his signature."

**RSC Chairman August Pfluger:** "The House did our job nearly 300 days ago. The Senate needs to do theirs. We're already a full year into the 119th Congress. The American people sent us here to get things done, not to make excuses. The Senate needs to stop stalling on this commonsense election integrity bill and get it to the floor."

**Rep. Eli Crane:** "Republicans were sent to Washington to fix a broken system, not to make excuses. If the Senate is still too weak to eliminate the filibuster, the least they could do is expose who exactly is standing in the way of election integrity."

**Rep. Buddy Carter:** "If you can't prove your citizenship, you shouldn't be able to vote. Anyone opposed to the SAVE Act wants to benefit from fraud, which undermines election security and gives illegal immigrants more power than law-abiding Americans. I'm calling on the Senate to advance this bill quickly so we can strengthen and secure our elections."

## Context:

- Majority Leader Thune has stated the bill must go through committee before receiving a floor vote
- The letter aims to pressure the Senate to act before the 2026 midterms
- The stated goal is to get the legislation to President Trump's desk for signature

# Summary of Article: House passes SAVE America Act

**Source:** NBC News  
**Date:** February 11, 2026

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- The House passed the SAVE America Act on Wednesday with a vote of **218-213**
- All Republicans voted in favor; all Democrats except one (Rep. Henry Cuellar, D-Texas) voted against
- Republicans control **53 seats** in the Senate
- A **Pew Research Center poll from August** found that **83% of U.S. adults** favor requiring government-issued photo ID to vote, including **71% of Democrats** and **76% of Black voters**

## Bill Provisions:

- Requires voters to show photo identification to cast a ballot in person
- Imposes new rules for mail-in ballots, requiring voters to submit a copy of eligible ID when requesting and casting an absentee ballot
- The bill was revised from an earlier version to include new demands from President Trump

## Named Source Opinions:

**Supporters:**
- **Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.):** Called it "common sense," comparing voter ID requirements to needing ID for driving, opening bank accounts, buying cold medicine, or filing for government assistance
- **Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.):** Expressed support and promised to bring it to a vote, though acknowledged uncertainty about how to reach that vote

**Opponents:**
- **House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.):** Called it "voter suppression" and a "desperate effort by Republicans to distract," claiming Republicans have "zero credibility on this issue"
- **Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska):** Opposed the bill, noting Republican hypocrisy after opposing Democratic election reform in 2021 for federalizing elections
- **Sen. Susan Collins (R-Maine):** Supported the original SAVE Act but finds the revised SAVE America Act "problematic" because it "went much broader than these original principles"
- **Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.):** Called it "Jim Crow type laws" and declared it "dead on arrival in the Senate"

**Other Notable Positions:**
- **Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.):** Has historically insisted elections should be run by states without federal interference (no direct quote on this specific bill)

## Legislative Outlook:

- The bill faces a "daunting path" in the Senate
- It has no path to the **60 votes** needed to break a filibuster
- Senate Republicans "firmly oppose elimination of the 60-vote threshold" despite Trump's demands to abolish it
- Thune stated there aren't "anywhere close to the votes — not even close — to nuking the filibuster"

## Political Context:

- Democrats note Trump's statements about wanting to "nationalize" elections and "take over the voting in at least — many, 15 places," which they say violates the Constitution
- The Constitution gives states authority over the "Times, Places and Manner of holding Elections" for federal office
- Democrats reference FBI seizure of ballots and voter records from Fulton County, Georgia, amid Trump's continued false claims about the 2020 election
- Current law already requires voters to attest to citizenship under oath with criminal penalties for violators

# Summary of Article: "House passes elections overhaul bill that could make it harder for married women to vote"

**Source:** The 19th  
**Date:** February 12, 2026  
**Author:** Marissa Martinez

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- The SAVE America Act passed the House on partisan lines, with only Texas Democrat Henry Cuellar voting for the legislation
- An estimated 69 million American women and 4 million men do not have a birth certificate that matches their current legal name
- The bill requires voters to present identification with names matching their birth certificates
- The bill mandates states to remove noncitizens from existing voter rolls and submit those logs to the Department of Homeland Security for review
- The bill would likely need 60 votes to overcome a Senate filibuster

## Named Source Opinions:

- **Rep. Teresa Leger Fernandez (D-NM, Chair of Democratic Women's Caucus):** Said "A real solution would eliminate the provision that requires women to go around and gather all these documents only to then affirm their own identity"
- **Rep. Tim Burchett (R-TN):** Called the concept of married women not being able to vote under the act "ridiculous" and said "It's an easy change — there's no problem with that at all"
- **Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-AK):** Expressed hesitancy, saying the voter ID push is "not how we build trust" and that "One-size-fits-all mandates from Washington, D.C., seldom work in places like Alaska"
- **House Speaker Mike Johnson:** Said "I don't think we need to be playing games with government funding" when explaining the decision to separate the SAVE Act from the spending package

## Context:

- The bill is part of a broader GOP strategy on election integrity and stricter voter ID requirements
- The White House reopened investigations on an election office in Fulton County, Georgia
- President Trump has expressed interest in "nationalizing" voting, though details remain vague
- A predecessor bill (Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act) passed the House last year but hasn't been taken up in the Senate
- The bill faces an "uphill battle" in the Senate, where some Republicans have expressed concerns

# Summary of "SAVE Act - NRVNews" (February 13, 2026)

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **SAVE Act passage**: In 2025, the House of Representatives passed the Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which requires states to obtain proof of citizenship when registering voters. The bill received bipartisan support.

2. **Senate filibuster rule**: The modern filibuster requires 60 votes in the 100-member Senate to end debate and prompt a vote on legislation.

3. **Government shutdown**: Late in 2025, Senate Democrats used the filibuster to refuse funding the U.S. Government, resulting in a record 43-day shutdown.

4. **SAVE America Act**: A new, enhanced version of the SAVE Act that requires:
   - Proof of citizenship when registering to vote in federal elections
   - Photo ID presentation when voting in federal elections

## Opinions from Reliable/Named Sources:

1. **Polling data on voter ID**: According to polls from Gallup and Pew Research Center, more than 80% of American citizens support photo ID requirements to vote.

## Potentially Useful Opinions (Less Reliable/Not-Named Sources):

1. **Author's position** (appears to be a House Representative based on references to "my office" and constituent contact information): 
   - Expresses frustration with the modern filibuster rule
   - Believes the filibuster violates the original intention of majority rule in the legislature
   - Supports reforming the filibuster to a "standing" or "talking" filibuster where senators must actively hold the floor
   - Is a co-sponsor of the SAVE America Act
   - Characterizes one Democratic lawmaker as describing American people's pain during the shutdown as 'leverage'

2. **Current Senate discussions**: The article states the Senate is engaged in "fresh discussions" on returning the filibuster to its historical form, with Republican lawmakers pushing Senate leadership to amend the filibuster rule.

# Summary of "Explainer: The Talking Filibuster"

**Source:** The Center for Renewing America  
**Date:** February 06, 2026  
**Author:** CRA Staff

## Key Facts and Information:

### Historical Background on the Filibuster:
- The talking filibuster is the original method of ending debate in the Senate, based on unlimited debate principles
- From 1806 to 1917, there was no cloture mechanism; debate only ended when senators stopped talking
- In 1917, the Senate adopted Rule XXII adding cloture at a two-thirds majority (67 votes)
- In 1975, the cloture threshold was lowered to three-fifths majority (60 votes) - the current rule
- The talking filibuster still exists in Senate rules but is rarely used due to the cloture mechanism

### Current Cloture Process:
- A cloture petition must be signed by at least 16 senators
- The Senate cannot vote on cloture until two calendar days after filing
- Most bills require 60 votes for cloture (exceptions include reconciliation bills requiring simple majority)
- After cloture is invoked, there are 30 additional hours of debate
- Final vote on the bill requires simple majority (51 votes)

### Talking Filibuster vs. Nuclear Option:
- The talking filibuster is **not** the nuclear option or elimination of the filibuster
- The nuclear option refers to the Senate operating in opposition to Standing Rules by setting new precedents
- Examples cited: Harry Reid in 2013 (lowered threshold for lower court and executive nominations to 51 votes) and Mitch McConnell in 2017 (Supreme Court nominations)

### How Talking Filibuster Could Pass the SAVE Act:
The article outlines a specific scenario for passing the SAVE Act:
- The Majority Leader would make the SAVE Act pending business without filing a cloture petition
- Per Senate Rule XIX, senators are limited to two speeches per legislative day on the same question
- A legislative day can last days, weeks, or months (not aligned with calendar days)
- All 47 Democrat senators opposing the bill would have two indefinite speaking periods each
- During speeches, senators cannot sit, take bathroom breaks, or consume anything except water or milk
- Opposing senators would use parliamentary tactics including motions to adjourn, amendment votes, and quorum calls
- Republican senators must stay near the Senate floor to respond to these tactics
- The filibuster would end when all opposing senators use their two speeches or one side gives up due to exhaustion
- If Republicans outlast Democrats or exhaust enough Democrats to sign a cloture petition (need 7 Democrat votes to reach 60), a final vote would occur at simple majority (51 votes)

**Note:** This article presents a specific legislative strategy perspective from the Center for Renewing America regarding potential use of the talking filibuster to pass the SAVE Act.

# Summary of Article: "Rick Scott calls for standing filibuster as fate of SAVE Act hangs in suspense"

**Source:** Florida Politics - Campaigns & Elections. Lobbying & Government.  
**Date:** January 24, 2026  
**Author:** A.G. Gancarski

## Key Facts and Statements:

1. **Legislative Status:** The Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act is currently stalled in the Senate. The Act has already passed the House of Representatives on party lines.

2. **Senate Vote Requirements:** The Senate's 60-vote cloture rule is preventing the measure from reaching a floor vote, despite Republicans holding 53 seats.

3. **Rick Scott's Position (Florida Republican Senator):**
   - Calls for using a standing filibuster to force Democrats to allow a floor vote
   - States he is confident all 53 Republican colleagues will back the SAVE Act
   - Suggests multiple pathways: including it in the spending bill, passing it as a separate bill, or using a standing filibuster
   - Quote: "We got to get this passed. We've got to secure elections. (There) cannot be another election, and we're worried about whether there's gonna be fraud in the election"

4. **SAVE Act Provisions:**
   - Requires voters to provide documentary proof of U.S. citizenship
   - Mandates states to purge non-citizens from voter rolls

5. **Scott's Rationale:**
   - Compares U.S. to Canada, France, and the United Kingdom, claiming non-citizens cannot vote in those countries
   - Frames the issue as a matter of national security and election security

6. **Timeline Context:** These statements were made on Saturday morning (January 24, 2026) on Fox News.
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: What is the current status of the SAVE Act in the U.S. Senate as of mid-February 2026? Has Senate Majority Leader Thune scheduled a floor vote or cloture vote, and if so, when is it expected to occur? Also, is there a State of the Union address scheduled for late February 2026?
Status of the SAVE Act in the Senate (as of 16-18 February 2026)

1. Legislative position
• The House passed the revised Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility legislation—now titled the “SAVE America Act” (S. 1383/H.R. — companion to the earlier SAVE Act)—on 11 February 2026 and transmitted it to the Senate (NBC News, 11 Feb 2026; Majority-Leader Scalise recap, 12 Feb 2026).  
• Under Senate rules the bill has been placed on the legislative calendar, but it has not yet been brought to the floor. No motion to proceed, cloture motion, or unanimous-consent agreement relating to the SAVE America Act/SAVE Act appears in the official Senate schedule or the running list of filed cloture motions through 18 February 2026 (Senate Democratic Leadership “Floor/Schedule” entries dated 9–19 Feb 2026).

2. Majority Leader John Thune’s public commitments
• Thune has repeatedly said he “will have a vote” on the SAVE America Act and intends to put every senator on record (Fox News, 16 Feb 2026; NBC News, 17 Feb 2026).  
• He has also cautioned that (a) Republicans do not have the 60 votes required to invoke cloture under the standing rules; (b) there are currently “not even close” to the votes to abolish or permanently alter the legislative filibuster; and (c) attempts to force a “talking filibuster” could tie up the floor for “weeks or literally … months” and crowd out other must-pass items (NBC News, 5 Feb 2026; NBC News, 17 Feb 2026).

3. Degree of Republican support
• Fifty of 53 Republican senators have announced support for the bill, with Sens. Murkowski and McConnell opposed or uncommitted (NBC News, 17 Feb 2026).  
• Sen. Susan Collins became the 50th GOP cosponsor but opposes gutting the filibuster, indicating any strategy must still reckon with the 60-vote threshold (NBC News, 17 Feb 2026).

4. Floor-action outlook
• Because no motion to proceed or cloture petition has been filed, the Senate’s executive and legislative calendars published for the week of 17 February list other business (DHS appropriations, D.C. tax resolution, executive nominations) but no action on the SAVE Act.  
• Thune’s statements constitute a promise of a vote but not a scheduled date. The lack of a filed cloture motion as of 18 February means that the earliest a cloture vote could occur—if one were filed on the next legislative day—would be two days later under Rule XXII, placing any potential cloture vote no earlier than the week of 24 February. However, that week already includes the State of the Union and may become compressed by leaders’ desire to avoid floor showdowns during the high-profile address.

5. Bottom-line status
• Current stage: awaiting motion to proceed in the Senate; no floor debate underway.  
• Scheduling: Majority Leader Thune has committed to hold a vote but has not yet placed the bill on the calendar for debate, filed cloture, or announced a target date. Therefore, as of mid-February 2026, no definitive timetable exists for either a cloture test or final passage vote.

State of the Union Address, late February 2026

• Speaker Mike Johnson formally invited President Donald Trump on 7 January 2026 to deliver the 2026 State of the Union.  
• Multiple news outlets and the non-partisan USAFacts site confirm the speech is set for Tuesday, 24 February 2026 at 9 p.m. ET before a joint session of Congress (USA Today, 7 Jan 2026; TV Insider via NonStop Local, 17 Feb 2026; USAFacts “2026 State of the Union”).

Conclusions relevant to the query

1. Current Senate status: The SAVE America Act/SAVE Act sits on the Senate calendar with no active consideration.  
2. Scheduling: Senate Majority Leader Thune has promised, but not actually scheduled, a floor vote. No cloture motion has been filed and no date has been set, so neither a cloture vote nor a final vote is currently expected on a specific day.  
3. State of the Union: Yes—President Trump’s State of the Union address is scheduled for the evening of Tuesday, 24 February 2026.

Information gaps

• Because the Senate publishes its schedule day-to-day, it is possible that Thune could file cloture or set the bill down by unanimous consent at any point after 18 February. Monitoring subsequent Daily Digest entries of the Congressional Record or the Senate Majority Leader’s “wrap-up” releases would be necessary to detect any late-breaking scheduling changes.</Agent_report>
