Here's What Borrowers Need to Know to Minimize the Pain**\nStarting July 1, 2026, major changes to the U.S. federal student loan system will take effect under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), which ends the Biden administration\u2019s Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) repayment plan and phases out other income-driven plans like Pay As You Earn (PAYE) and Income-Contingent Repayment (ICR). The SAVE plan, which had over 4 million borrowers by September 2023, previously capped monthly payments at 5% of discretionary income, forgave balances after 10 years for low-balance borrowers, and allowed payments to drop to zero for those earning under $32,800 annually. With the plan's termination, approximately 7 million borrowers will be transitioned to new repayment options by 2028. Two new plans will be introduced: the revised Income-Based Repayment (IBR) plan with a 10-year term and fixed payments, and the new Repayment Assistance Plan (RAP), which sets minimum monthly payments at $10 (1% of adjusted gross income) and offers a $50-per-child discount, with interest forgiven monthly and loans forgiven after 30 years. Parent PLUS and Graduate PLUS loans will also be restructured\u2014Grad PLUS loans will be eliminated for most graduate students, capping annual borrowing at $20,500 (or $50,000 for medical, law, and professional schools), and Parent PLUS loans will be limited to $65,000 per child. The Trump administration has postponed wage garnishment for defaulted borrowers indefinitely, though it remains a future possibility. Public Service Loan Forgiveness (PSLF) remains intact but has been narrowed to exclude employers involved in 'substantial illegal activities,' raising concerns about political bias. These changes affect nearly 43 million borrowers collectively owing $1.6 trillion in federal student debt, with 10.3 million in forbearance and 6 million delinquent or near default as of June 2025. Critics, including Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, argue the changes make college financing harder, while officials like Under Secretary Nicholas Kent assert that borrowers must repay loans and taxpayers should not subsidize 'irresponsible policies.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 12:38 AM\nSource:[Reader's Digest](https://www.rd.com/article/federal-student-loan-changes-2026/)\n\n**Key Data Protection Changes Under The Data Use And Access Act 2025 Comes Into Force**\nOn February 5, 2026, the Data (Use and Access) Act 2025 (Commencement No. 6 and Transitional and Saving Provisions) Regulations 2026 (Commencement Regulation) came into force, implementing major amendments to the UK GDPR, the Privacy and Electronic Communications Regulations 2003 (PECR), and the Data Protection Act 2018. Key changes include the introduction of a new 'recognised legitimate interests' legal basis under which organisations may process personal data without balancing against individual interests if the processing serves one of five specified purposes. Automated decision-making may now rely on any lawful basis\u2014including legitimate interests (but not the new recognised legitimate interests)\u2014provided appropriate safeguards are in place. Rules on re-purposing data have been broadened to include scientific, historical, statistical, public security, and crime prevention purposes. Data subject rights now clarify that response deadlines begin when the organisation receives the request, any requested identity verification information, or a fee for manifestly unfounded or excessive requests; organisations need only conduct reasonable and proportionate searches for subject access requests. Individuals now have a direct right to complain to organisations if they believe their data has been misused. Data protection by design now requires online services likely accessed by children to implement age-appropriate safeguards, acknowledging children\u2019s varying developmental stages and limited understanding of data use. International data transfers now require a standard of protection that is 'not materially lower' than UK standards, replacing the previous 'essentially equivalent' threshold. New cookie exemptions allow processing without consent if the purpose is for statistical analysis or adapting website functionality to user preferences. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) has enhanced enforcement powers, including the ability to compel witness interviews and demand reports, and PECR fines have increased to a maximum of \u00a317.5 million or 4% of global turnover (whichever is higher), up from \u00a3500,000.

The bill, a revised version of the 2025 SAVE Act, mandates that new voter registrants provide proof of U.S. citizenship and present a photo ID, while requiring states to cross-check voter rolls against the Department of Homeland Security\u2019s Systematic Alien Verification for Entitlements (SAVE) database. These provisions would take effect immediately upon enactment. However, passage in the Senate is highly unlikely due to the 60-vote filibuster threshold, and Senate Majority Leader John Thune has not signaled support for changing the rule. The bill would impose new requirements on millions of Americans, as only three states currently require proof of citizenship and 27 do not require photo IDs. Election officials warn the law would create a logistical and financial burden: Minnesota Secretary of State Steve Simon called it a 'nightmare' for administrators. A 2023 SSRS survey found that 9% of voting-age citizens lack easy access to citizenship documents. In Kansas, after implementing such a law in 2013, 31,089 people were disenfranchised\u201412% of registrants\u2014while only 39 noncitizens were identified over 14 years. A 2024 Orange County, California, analysis estimated that verifying 633,568 registrations would require 59 additional staff and $6 million. The Campaign Legal Center reports that Kansas and Arizona spent millions on staffing, education, system upgrades, and legal defense due to proof-of-citizenship laws. While advocates like Justin Riemer argue states can adapt quickly\u2014citing pandemic-era changes and existing DMV expertise\u2014officials stress they lack time and funding. Ultimately, the bill may not be designed to pass, but to fuel claims of election insecurity, potentially undermining public trust in future results if it fails.

The State and Local Tax (SALT) deduction cap increases from $10,000 to $40,000 in 2025, rising to $40,400 in 2026 and increasing by 1% annually through 2029 before reverting to $10,000 in 2030. However, this deduction only benefits homeowners who itemize, and many renters and lower-income homeowners do not see direct benefits. Private Mortgage Insurance (PMI) premiums are now deductible again in 2026, with eligibility limited to adjusted gross incomes below $100,000 (phasing out at $110,000), primarily aiding conventional loan buyers with less than 20% down payments. The $750,000 mortgage interest deduction limit, previously set under the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, is now permanent. Home equity loan interest remains nondeductible unless funds are used for home improvements and stay within the $750,000 limit. Notably, the Residential Clean Energy Credit and Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit expired at the end of 2025, meaning no energy-related tax credits are available for 2026 and beyond. Tax expert Keith Schroeder emphasized that tax benefits should not drive real estate decisions\u2014local market conditions matter more\u2014and that homeowners should avoid assuming their situation mirrors others'. The overall takeaway is that while headline changes exist, actual tax savings depend on individual circumstances, and due diligence is essential. These changes apply to tax returns filed in 2026 for the 2025 tax year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 03:30 PM\nSource:[Stacker](https://www.newhomesource.com/news/policy-industry/expiring-tax-breaks-for-homeowners/)\n\n**petition: The SAVE Act threatens voting access nationwide. The Senate must shut it down!**\nThe SAVE Act has been passed by the U.S. House of Representatives and now moves to the Senate, where it faces intense scrutiny. The legislation imposes strict proof-of-citizenship requirements and documentation rules that election experts warn could prevent eligible voters from registering. Groups like the Brennan Center for Justice warn the bill could disenfranchise millions, particularly young voters, seniors, married women with name changes, working families, and naturalized citizens. Although the bill is framed as enhancing 'election security,' studies confirm noncitizen voting in federal elections is illegal and exceedingly rare, with no evidence of widespread fraud. Advocates argue the timing is strategic, aiming to influence voter access ahead of the next federal election. A petition urges the Senate to reject the bill and protect voting rights. The petition was published on February 17, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 08:00 AM\nSource:[The Petition Site](https://www.thepetitionsite.com/518/760/368/the-save-act-threatens-voting-access-nationwide.-the-senate-must-shut-it-down/)\n\n**Padilla: SAVE Act Is the 'Equivalent of a Show Me Your Papers Law'**\nSenator Alex Padilla (D-CA) criticized the SAVE America Act on February 17, 2026, during an appearance on MS NOW\u2019s 'Velshi,' calling it the 'equivalent of a show me your papers law' because it requires proof of citizenship and a photo ID to vote. Padilla argued that the law is 'absolutely nonsensical,' noting that not all Americans possess passports, and that requiring birth certificates or passports disproportionately impacts vulnerable groups. He highlighted specific examples, including married women whose names differ between their birth certificates and IDs, residents in rural areas who must travel long distances to county courthouses to verify registration, and military personnel deployed across bases who face difficulties updating their voter registration. Padilla emphasized that these requirements create significant barriers to voting, especially for those already working over 18 hours a day to make ends meet. He concluded that the SAVE Act is 'a solution in search of a problem' and claimed the only thing it 'saves' is Republican chances of maintaining power.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 04:45 AM\nSource:[breitbart.com](https://www.breitbart.com/clips/2026/02/16/padilla-save-act-is-the-equivalent-of-a-show-me-your-papers-law/)\n\n**Laredoans speak after House passes SAVE America Act**\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed the SAVE America Act, a bill requiring proof of U.S. citizenship and a valid photo ID to register to vote in federal elections. The bill received support from all Republicans and Congressman Henry Cuellar of Texas District 28, the only Democrat to vote in favor. If enacted, the law would take effect starting with the November 2026 general election, according to officials at the Webb County Election Department. Laredo residents expressed support, with one stating, 'It's necessary because they need to see the correct address of the person voting. It has to be completely accurate; otherwise, what's the point?

The legislation also requires a photo ID and mandates local election offices to share voter data with the Department of Homeland Security. The bill was introduced to fulfill President Donald Trump\u2019s calls for stricter voting rules, following his unsubstantiated claims of 'corruption' in voting processes. While supporters highlight broad public backing for photo ID requirements, opponents warn that the new rules could disenfranchise millions of eligible citizens, especially those without easy access to birth certificates, passports, or updated documents. Noncitizen voting is widely acknowledged to be extremely rare. Senators Katie Britt and Tommy Tuberville publicly supported the bill. When criticized for potentially affecting married women who changed their names on social media, Britt dismissed such concerns as 'fearmongering.' The bill is expected to face strong opposition in the Senate.

Oklahoma legislators react as voter ID bill heads to Senate**\nThe Safeguard American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, which passed the U.S. House of Representatives on February 11, 2026, requires voters to provide documented proof of U.S. citizenship\u2014such as a birth certificate or passport\u2014and present a government-issued photo ID during voter registration and at the polls. The bill aims to strengthen voter eligibility verification, with 36 states already requiring some form of ID at the polls, while 14 states and Washington, DC, use alternative verification methods. Oklahoma Republican legislators Sen. Markwayne Mullin and Sen. James Lankford support the bill, citing national consensus\u201483% of Americans supported ID requirements in a 2025 poll\u2014and emphasizing the constitutional principle that only citizens should vote. However, voting rights advocates, including Tappan Vickery of HeadCount, warn the bill could create barriers for individuals with name changes, particularly married women: nearly 80% of women in opposite-sex marriages take their spouse\u2019s surname, creating mismatches between names on birth certificates and driver\u2019s licenses. Vickery notes that voters may need to obtain additional documents like marriage licenses or passports\u2014processes that can be time-consuming and costly\u2014potentially discouraging participation.

As of mid-February 2026, the bill passed the House in July 2025 with a 220-208 vote but remains stalled in the Senate due to Democratic opposition and the threat of a filibuster. If enacted, the law would mandate acceptable documents such as a U.S. passport, birth certificate, naturalization certificate, REAL ID-compliant driver\u2019s license, or certain tribal or military records. It would prohibit states from accepting federal voter registration forms without attached proof, potentially leading to loss of federal election funding for non-compliance. The bill would significantly disrupt mail, online, and automatic voter registration systems, with estimated impacts on 20\u201330 million eligible U.S. citizens who lack immediate access to citizenship documents. Groups disproportionately affected include young voters (18\u201324), low-income individuals, rural residents, elderly citizens, minority communities, naturalized Americans, married women who changed names, and people experiencing homelessness. Critics argue the bill would create unnecessary barriers despite non-citizen voting being extremely rare (less than 0.0001% of votes), while supporters claim it strengthens election integrity. Legal challenges are expected on grounds of violating the National Voter Registration Act or equal protection principles. The bill\u2019s passage remains unlikely in the current Congress but could gain momentum if Republicans win control of the Senate in the 2026 midterms.

The League of Women Voters of Pennsylvania warns that this would disenfranchise hundreds of thousands of eligible voters, particularly those without access to documents like birth certificates, passports, or updated driver\u2019s licenses\u2014such as newly married women, naturalized citizens, military personnel overseas, and people who have recently moved. The organization emphasizes that noncitizen voting is already prohibited by federal law, with existing verification processes in place, and there is no evidence of widespread noncitizen voter fraud. The bill is described as federal overreach that adds unnecessary burdens\u2014such as travel, fees, and lost work time\u2014without addressing a real problem. The original SAVE Act failed in 2025 due to public opposition, and this version is seen as a repackage of the same restrictive policy. The League urges Pennsylvania\u2019s senators to reject the bill, asserting that election integrity and voter access are not mutually exclusive and that democracy thrives when all eligible citizens can vote without facing undue bureaucratic hurdles.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 05:24 PM\nSource:[The Philadelphia Inquirer](https://www.inquirer.com/opinion/commentary/save-act-voting-elections-disenfranchise-congress-20260212.html)\n\n**U.S. House Passes 'SAVE Act' Mandating Voter ID, Sends Bill to Senate Amid Partisan Debate**\nThe U.S. House of Representatives passed the 'SAVE Act' legislation, which mandates photo identification for voting and stricter voter registration requirements, sending it to the Senate. The bill passed with 218 'yes' votes against 213 'no' votes, reflecting deep partisan divisions. House Speaker Mike Johnson argued that requiring ID for voting is no different from using ID for banking or purchasing medication. Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries criticized the bill, stating it is not about voter verification but about suppressing voters. The bill requires voters to present proof of U.S. citizenship during registration and present photo ID when voting. The legislation must gain bipartisan support in the Senate, where not all 53 Republican senators are expected to back it. The upcoming U.S. elections, scheduled for November 3, 2026, will determine all 435 seats in the House and 35 of the 100 Senate seats. Former President Donald Trump urged Republicans to 'nationalize' and 'take control' of the election process, drawing Democratic backlash. Trump had previously called for the swift passage of the SAVE Act on February 6, 2026.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 07:25 AM\nSource:[Haberler](https://www.haberler.com/guncel/abd-de-oy-kullaniminda-kimlik-ibrazi-zorunlulugu-getiren-tasari-senatoya-gonderildi-19559743-haberi/)\n\n**House Republicans push election overhaul with voter ID, mail-in ballot changes ahead of midterms**\nHouse Republicans are advancing a sweeping election reform package called the Make Elections Great Again (MEGA) Act, unveiled by the Committee on House Administration on January 29, 2026, ahead of the 2026 midterm elections. The legislation incorporates key elements of the Safeguarding American Voter Eligibility (SAVE) Act, led by Rep. Chip Roy, R-Texas, and includes mandatory proof of citizenship for first-time voter registration, photo ID requirements for federal elections, and a ban on universal mail-in ballots\u2014requiring voters to request them individually. Mail-in ballots must be received by Election Day to be counted, and third-party ballot harvesting is prohibited. The bill also bans ranked-choice voting in federal races, mandates auditable paper ballots, and strengthens voter roll maintenance. Committee Chairman Bryan Steil, R-Wis., stated the measures aim to 'improve voter confidence, bolster election integrity, and make it easy to vote, but hard to cheat.' While progressive Democrats and groups like the League of Women Voters warn that photo ID laws may disenfranchise minority voters, the Heritage Foundation notes such measures are popular in public polls. The legislation follows increased pressure in the Senate, including from Elon Musk, to pass the SAVE Act. The move comes amid historical midterm trends that typically favor the opposition party after a change in presidential power, though GOP leaders remain optimistic about reversing that pattern. The White House was contacted for comment but did not respond by press time.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 29, 2026 04:00 PM\nSource:[Fox News](https://www.foxnews.com/politics/house-republicans-push-election-overhaul-voter-id-mail-in-ballot-changes-ahead-midterms)\n\n**Americans to save up to $3,752 as five new tax laws come into force January 26**\nThe One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), signed into law by President Trump, is set to take effect on January 26, 2026, introducing a series of tax changes expected to save the average American taxpayer $3,752, according to Joel Salas, a tax expert with JustAnswer. The legislation makes permanent key provisions from the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act, including the high standard deduction and the Child Tax Credit, now increased to $2,200 per child and partially refundable up to $1,700. A new $6,000 senior deduction (up to $12,000 for married couples) for Americans aged 65 and older, phased out above $75,000 (individuals) and $150,000 (joint filers), can save seniors up to $2,640 in taxes when combined, depending on their tax bracket. The Trump Account, a new savings vehicle for minors born between January 1, 2025, and December 31, 2028, includes a $1,000 federal seed deposit, with potential for over $300,000 by age 18 and over $1 million by 28 under typical market returns. Additional provisions include a deduction for up to $25,000 in tip income (2025\u20132028) and up to $12,500 in overtime pay (2028 cap), both phased out at high income levels, with average savings of $1,400 per taxpayer. These benefits are not refundable for FICA taxes, which still apply to tips and overtime. The Tax Policy Center estimates that about 3% of households will benefit from the tip deduction and 9% from the overtime deduction. Overall, the law is projected to reduce federal tax revenue by over $4 trillion over ten years.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 18, 2026 11:00 AM\nSource:[The US Sun](https://www.the-sun.com/money/15771458/taxes-save-money-trump-obbba-new-deductions-returns/)\n\n**SAVE borrowers must switch to new student loan repayment plan**\nOver seven million federal student loan borrowers must transition from the Saving on a Valuable Education (SAVE) plan, a Biden-era initiative introduced in 2023 to offer lower monthly payments and faster loan forgiveness, after the U.S. Department of Education announced a settlement on December 9, 2025, effectively ending the plan. The department will no longer accept new applicants and will begin enrolling existing SAVE borrowers into alternative repayment plans, though no specific deadline has been set for making the switch. The Department of Education will initiate direct outreach to affected borrowers in the coming weeks to guide them through the transition. In Indiana alone, approximately 147,800 borrowers are enrolled in SAVE, collectively owing over $30 billion in federal student loans. Although SAVE borrowers were not required to make payments starting July 2024, interest began accruing in August 2024. Borrowers are advised to use the Department\u2019s Loan Simulator, though it has not yet been updated to reflect changes from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Available options include standard repayment plans\u2014fixed monthly payments over 10 years\u2014or income-driven repayment plans, which base payments on income and family size, often resulting in lower monthly payments but potentially higher long-term interest. To qualify for income-driven plans, borrowers must apply through the Federal Student Aid office. Borrowers seeking to pause payments may apply for forbearance or deferment, though interest will continue to accrue on their loans.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 15, 2025 08:25 PM\nSource:[WFYI Public Media](https://www.wfyi.org/news/articles/save-borrowers-must-switch-to-new-student-loan-repayment-plan)\n\n**Major 401(k) Change Coming in 2026  --  High Earners Must Act Now**\nStarting in 2027, the Secure 2.0 Act will require high-earning employees aged 50 and older who earn $145,000 or more annually to contribute their catch-up 401(k) funds exclusively to a Roth 401(k), rather than a traditional 401(k). This change means these individuals will pay taxes on their catch-up contributions upfront, but future withdrawals will be tax-free. Those earning below $145,000 annually can still use traditional 401(k) catch-up contributions to defer taxes until retirement. As of 2025, individuals under 50 can contribute up to $23,500 annually to a 401(k), with an additional $7,500 catch-up contribution for those aged 50 and older. For employees aged 60 to 63, the catch-up contribution increases to $11,250. The total combined employer and employee contributions, excluding catch-up amounts, cannot exceed $70,000 per year. The change is designed to improve retirement savings for workers, but high earners must act now to maximize their current tax-deferred contributions before the new rules take effect.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 28, 2025 02:07 PM\nSource:[NASDAQ Stock Market](https://www.nasdaq.com/articles/major-401k-change-coming-2026-high-earners-must-act-now)\n\n**Google Trends: Why taxpayers are searching more about the Income Tax Department**\nThe term 'Income Tax Department' has become one of the most searched keywords on Google Trends due to over 1.1 crore taxpayers still awaiting processing of their income tax returns (ITRs) for Assessment Year (AY) 2025-26. As of November 26, 2025, 8.21 crore ITRs have been filed, with 8.1 crore verified, but only 6.98 crore processed, leaving more than 1.1 crore returns in the queue. This surge in searches is driven by refund delays, the approaching belated ITR deadline of December 31, 2025, and recent tax reforms, including the passage of the Income Tax Bill, 2025, which will replace the 1961 Income Tax Act from April 1, 2026. The filing deadline was extended to September 16, 2025, from the usual July 31, due to changes in rules, forms, and compliance requirements. Taxpayers are searching for updates on penalties, interest on refunds, and how to file belated returns. Penalties for belated filing are Rs 1,000 for taxable income below Rs 5 lakh and Rs 5,000 for higher income. Interest of 1% per month is charged on unpaid tax under Section 234A, but taxpayers receive 0.5% monthly interest (6% annually) on refunds, calculated from the filing date or April 1 of the assessment year. Google Trends data confirms sustained high search volumes for terms like 'refund status', 'belated ITR penalties', and 'interest on refund'. The Financial Express reports that anxiety is rising as the December 31, 2025 deadline nears, and search activity is expected to increase further.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 27, 2025 10:46 AM\nSource:[The Financial Express](https://www.financialexpress.com/money/google-trends-why-taxpayers-are-searching-more-about-the-income-tax-department-4058056/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
