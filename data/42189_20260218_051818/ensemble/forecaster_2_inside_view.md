Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**High-quality factual sources:**
- **FRED NASDAQ100 series (Feb 17, 2026)**: Official daily index data showing 24,732.73 on Feb 13 and 24,701.60 on Feb 17. Highest reliability for historical values.
- **Investopedia (Feb 18, 2026)**: Reports Feb 17 session: Nasdaq Composite +0.1%, recovering from worst week of 2026. Mentions upcoming PCE/GDP data Friday. Factual market reporting.
- **Finanzen.net (Feb 17, 2026)**: Reports NASDAQ 100 closed at 24,701.60 (-0.13%) on Tuesday Feb 17. YTD down 2.00%. Factual intraday data.

**Moderate-quality sources:**
- **Meyka blog (Feb 9, 2026)**: Reports Nasdaq hit 23,031 on Feb 8 with 2.2% gain. Historical context but dated for our 6-day horizon.
- **Economic Times (date unclear)**: Reports ~2% Nasdaq 100 decline during government shutdown period. Useful context on volatility drivers but timing ambiguous.
- **Blockonomi (Feb 17, 2026)**: Reports $7B outflow from Nasdaq 100 futures positions between mid-Jan and Feb 10, largest since spring 2025. Cites CFTC data and Morgan Stanley strategists. Moderate evidence of positioning shift.

**Lower-quality/promotional sources:**
- **NAGA forecast article**: Mixes S&P 500 bank forecasts with Nasdaq implications. Bank targets suggest 4-17% upside for 2026 but lack specific Nasdaq 100 values.
- **Investing.com analysis articles**: Technical analysis with subjective pattern interpretation. Opinions without clear predictive track records.

**Key identifiable expert opinions:**
- Morgan Stanley (Michael Wilson): Views AI disruption concerns as normal volatility in investment cycles, sees AI as structural growth driver
- Multiple banks (BofA, JPM, Goldman, Deutsche): 2026 targets imply 4-17% S&P gains, suggesting similar Nasdaq trajectory

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- **Current price anchor (24,701.60 on Feb 17)**: Direct factual baseline. The question asks for Feb 26 close = 6 trading days forward.
- **Recent volatility pattern**: Index traded 24,387-24,818 range on Feb 17; YTD range 24,387-26,165. This 7% YTD range over 33 trading days suggests ~1.2% daily volatility, consistent with outside view.

**Moderate evidence:**
- **Positioning shift**: $7B outflow from long positions + $3B increase in shorts suggests defensive positioning. This could dampen upside but doesn't predict direction.
- **Upcoming catalysts (Feb 21 & 26)**: PCE inflation data Friday Feb 21, FOMC minutes Wednesday Feb 26. These are known volatility events but direction uncertain.
- **AI disruption narrative**: Multiple sources cite concerns about AI impact on software/IT services. This drove -2% week prior to Feb 17, but sentiment appears stabilizing (Feb 17 recovered intraday).
- **Technical levels**: Support mentioned at 24,000-24,112; resistance at 25,200-26,000. Provides plausible bounds but not predictive.

**Weak evidence:**
- **Bank 2026 year-end forecasts**: Too long-term (10+ months) for 6-day forecast.
- **Subjective technical patterns**: Triangle patterns, trend lines lack predictive validation.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Horizon: 6 trading days (Feb 18-26, 2026)**

This is an extremely short forecast window. Key considerations:
- **If halved to 3 days**: Would tighten distribution significantly (~2.2% std dev vs 3.2%), reducing tail risks. Status quo bias stronger.
- **If doubled to 12 days**: Would widen distribution (~4.5% std dev), incorporate more macro uncertainty and additional earnings reports.

**Catalysts within window:**
1. **Feb 21 (Friday)**: PCE inflation data + Q4 GDP. Could move market ±1-2% if surprise.
2. **Feb 26 (Wednesday)**: FOMC minutes release. Typically lower volatility than live meetings.
3. **Ongoing**: Tech earnings season winding down; Nvidia earnings likely in this period (major catalyst).

The 6-day window is short enough that structural trends matter less than event risk and momentum.

## (d) Justification for Adjustments

**Factors supporting modest downward bias from outside view:**
1. **Recent momentum**: Index down 2% YTD, just recovered from worst week of 2026. Near-term momentum slightly negative.
2. **Defensive positioning**: Large futures outflow suggests institutional caution, potentially limiting upside.
3. **Elevated uncertainty**: AI disruption narrative + missing economic data (per shutdown) creates fog.

**Factors supporting upward potential:**
1. **Technical support held**: Feb 17 low of 24,387 held above critical 24,000-24,112 support zone.
2. **Intraday recovery pattern**: Feb 17 recovered from -1% to close near flat, showing buying interest.
3. **Dovish Fed expectations**: Multiple sources cite rate cut expectations supporting tech valuations.

**Net assessment:**
The outside view (median ~24,750) seems reasonable but slightly optimistic given recent weakness. I'll shift the distribution ~1% lower to reflect:
- Continuation of mild negative momentum (weak evidence)
- Defensive positioning limiting upside (moderate evidence)
- Known volatility events ahead (moderate evidence)

However, I'll maintain similar tail widths (±5-6% from median) because:
- 6-day horizon limits extreme moves absent crisis
- VIX/VXN not signaling stress
- Historical 1-week moves rarely exceed ±6% outside crises

Distribution calibration:

Starting from outside view median of 24,750, I'll adjust to 24,600 (0.4% below last close) to reflect mild negative momentum and defensive positioning. This implies the index drifts slightly lower or trades sideways over the 6-day window.

Tail calibration:
- **10th percentile**: Allow for ~5% downside to 23,400 (captures bad PCE surprise + momentum breakdown)
- **90th percentile**: Allow for ~6% upside to 26,100 (captures strong Nvidia earnings + dovish Fed surprise)
- **Middle percentiles**: Cluster around 24,000-25,100 range reflecting most likely scenarios

This distribution is slightly more pessimistic than outside view but respects that 6-day windows rarely produce extreme moves.

Checklist:

1. **Target**: NASDAQ 100 Index closing value on Feb 26, 2026 (6 trading days forward). Units: Index points.

2. **Base rate**: Outside view median ~24,750 with ±3.2% std dev (23,400-26,100 at 10th-90th percentiles).

3. **Consistency**: Implied median ≈ 24,600; mean ≈ 24,650. This reflects mild continuation of recent weakness with symmetric tail risks. Aligns with defensive positioning and near-term uncertainty.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Last close 24,701.60 on Feb 17 (factual anchor)
   - $7B futures outflow + increased shorts (moderate evidence of caution)
   - PCE/FOMC catalysts Feb 21-26 (moderate volatility risk)
   - YTD range 24,387-26,165 establishes plausible bounds (strong evidence)
   - Recent -2% weekly decline with stabilization (weak momentum signal)

5. **Blind spot**: Nvidia earnings surprise (positive or negative) could drive ±3-4% single-day move, making my relatively tight distribution look naive. This would push outcome toward tails (either 23,000 or 26,500+).

6. **Status quo**: Current price 24,701. My median of 24,600 is very close (0.4% lower), appropriate for 6-day horizon where drift is minimal. Not over-adjusting.

7. **Technicalities**: Values strictly increasing, all within bounds (14,973-29,891), units in Index points as requested.
