Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED NASDAQ100 series (latest obs = 24 701.60 on 17 Feb 26). Highest-quality, directly determines the settlement value. Pure fact, no opinion.  
2. Finanzen.net wrap-ups (17 Feb). Real-time close/hi/lo data and YTD stats for NASDAQ-100; factual, reputable German quote service. Opinion content minimal.  
3. Investopedia daily market recap (18 Feb). Factual summary of prior U.S. session; some colour commentary. Medium quality, no forecasts.  
4. Blockonomi/CFTC positioning story (17 Feb). CFTC futures data showing a US $7 bn long liquidation and US $3 bn rise in shorts since mid-Jan. Quantified, comes from an identifiable regulator; moderate evidence.  
5. Investing.com “market warning” (17 Feb). Technician notes weekly sell-signal, VIX rising. Opinion from identifiable market analyst; weak-to-moderate evidence.  
6. Meyka article (09 Feb) & NAGA outlook (undated early Feb). Forward-looking bank targets and generic AI narrative. Mostly opinion / promotional—weak evidence for a one-week horizon.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong: none (no structural or multi-source confirmations over a one-week window).  
Moderate:  
• CFTC data – material reduction in net longs (downward pressure).  
• Consecutive weekly decline in NASDAQ-100, breach of lower channel line – indicates short-term negative momentum.  
Weak (small upward tilt):  
• Fed-rate-cut expectations creeping higher; AI earnings still robust.  
• Technical support cluster 24 000–24 100 repeatedly respected since October 25.  

Net evidence: slightly negative drift versus the outside-view “flat” expectation, but not large enough to dominate volatility.  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon = 8 calendar days / ~7 trading sessions. If the horizon were halved, drift influence would be even smaller and volatility band ≈ √(½) ≈ 0.7× current; if doubled, drift could matter (~1 % typical move) and the one-sigma band would widen by √2 ≈ 1.4×.  

(d) Justification – inside-view shift  
Outside-view centre was the 17 Feb close (24 701) with σ≈3.3 %.  
Inside view:  
• Short-term momentum & positioning tilt –0.5 % (≈ –125 pts).  
• Support near 24 000 suggests downside tail slightly fatter, upside tail slightly slimmer.  
Adjustments applied: centre lowered to 24 600; 10th percentile pushed a bit further down, 90th slightly compressed. Volatility kept similar (σ≈3.5 %).  

Distribution calibration
Mean/median anchored at 24 600. Using a near-normal shape with σ≈3.5 % (~860 pts) then applying the asymmetric tweaks described yields:  
10th ≈ –5.3 % from spot → 23 400  
20th ≈ –3.3 % → 23 900  
40th ≈ –1.2 % → 24 400  
60th ≈ +0.4 % → 24 800  
80th ≈ +2.9 % → 25 400  
90th ≈ +4.4 % → 25 800  

Checklist:  
1. Target = NASDAQ 100 Index closing value 26 Feb 2026, units “Index”.  
2. Base-rate distribution stated above; final forecast is a mild negative skew of that.  
3. Implied median = 24 600; mean very similar; plausible given rationale.  
4. Key evidence: (i) CFTC $7 bn long liquidation, (ii) Weekly sell-signal/technical break, (iii) Support band 24 000–24 100, (iv) Realised vol ~19 % ann.  
5. Blind-spot: Surprise dovish Fed minutes + blow-out AI earnings spark >5 % rally (would push outcome above 26 000).  
6. Status-quo anchor (24 700) consciously retained as near-centre.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, in requested units, within open bounds.
