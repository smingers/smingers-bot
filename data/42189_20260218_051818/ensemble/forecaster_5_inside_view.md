Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Finanzen.net closing report, 17 Feb 2026 – hard price data for NASDAQ-100 on the most recent trading day (24 701.6).  Very reliable, near-real-time market tape.  Factual.  
2. Blockonomi, 17 Feb 2026 – CFTC commitment-of-traders showing a USD 7 bn cut to net-long NDX futures.  Primary data quoted, but commentary about “AI fears” is opinion.  Medium quality.  
3. Investing.com market-warning piece, 17 Feb 2026 – purely technical-analysis opinions that the index triggered a sell signal.  Identifiable author but methodology subjective.  Weak-to-moderate.  
4. Investopedia U.S. markets wrap, 18 Feb 2026 – factual description of yesterday’s broad-market performance plus coming macro releases.  High reliability for prices, neutral for outlook.  
5. NAGA “2026 price prediction” article, Jan 2026 – marketing-laden, mixes S&P projections with NASDAQ-100 comments.  Mostly opinion, low weight.  
6. Meyka 9 Feb 2026 rally story – factual description of earlier one-day surge; stale for our six-day horizon.  Weak evidence today.  

(b) Evidence analysis  
• Strong: none – no structural shock or confirmed macro policy decision scheduled before 26 Feb.  
• Moderate:  
  – Net-long futures reduction (CFTC) shows positioning turning defensive (single reliable source).  
  – Short-term technical break below channel identified by several technicians (independent sources), suggesting downward momentum.  
• Weak:  
  – NAGA bullish banks’ year-end targets (long horizon, promotional).  
  – One-day moves and sentiment chatter.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Target is 6 U.S. trading sessions (today 18 Feb to close 26 Feb = 8 calendar days).  If horizon were halved to 3 sessions I would compress the σ by √(3/6) ≈ 0.71 and move the mean 30 % closer to the current spot; if doubled to 12 sessions I would expand σ by √2 ≈ 1.4 and let macro data (PCE, GDP, FOMC rhetoric) have greater influence, nudging the mean slightly positive on expectations of dovish talk.

(d) Justification – inside-view shift  
Outside view (2006-2025 six-day windows): mean +0.24 %, σ 3.2 %.  
Inside factors now tilt modestly negative: futures de-risking, fresh technical sell signals, AI-disruption narrative, and the index already down 2 % YTD.  I lower the expected drift by ~0.5 % (≈ –0.8 σ) and leave volatility unchanged—no evidence of an upcoming macro shock large enough to raise σ.  This yields a median around 24 630 versus the current 24 702.  Tails are widened slightly (10th at –5.7 %, 90th at +5.6 %) to respect the fat-tailed empirical distribution and the possibility of a data-driven surprise (PCE, GDP, large-cap earnings).

Distribution calibration
Starting point: 24 702 (17 Feb close).  
Median (≈50th percentile, not required to report) ≈ 24 630 (-0.3 %).  
Std-dev retained at 3.2 % ≈ 790 index points.  
Percentiles rounded to nearest 10:

10th  –5.7 % → 23 300  
20th  –3.2 % → 23 900  
40th  –1.0 % → 24 450  
60th  +0.4 % → 24 800  
80th  +3.2 % → 25 500  
90th  +5.6 % → 26 100  

Checklist:
1. Target: NASDAQ-100 closing value for 26 Feb 2026 as reported by FRED, index units.  
2. Base rate: mean +0.24 %, σ 3.2 % over six trading days, fat-tailed.  
3. Consistency: implied median ≈ 24 630, mean ≈ 24 660; matches slight negative bias, plausible.  
4. Key evidence: a) CFTC shows $7 bn long reduction, b) channel-break sell signals, c) YTD –2 % momentum, d) upcoming PCE/GDP data uncertainty.  
5. Blind-spot: a shock dovish Fed comment or blockbuster AI earnings driving a >7 % rally (would push outcome above 26 400).  
6. Status quo: sideways range 24 400–25 000 past fortnight—forecast keeps bulk probability inside.  
7. Technical: percentiles strictly increasing, within open bounds, correct units.
