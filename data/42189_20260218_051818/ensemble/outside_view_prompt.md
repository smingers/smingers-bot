The forecasting question is:
What will be the value of "NASDAQ 100 Index" on 2026-02-26?

Question background:
The Federal Reserve Economic Data database (FRED) provides economic data from national, international, public, and private sources. The series NASDAQ100 is a dataset that is tracked by the FRED API.

The seasonal adjustment of the series is "Not Seasonally Adjusted". An interactive graph for the series can be found [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/NASDAQ100). Below are the notes attached to the series:

> The observations for the NASDAQ 100 Index represent the daily index value at market close. The market typically closes at 4 PM ET, except for holidays when it sometimes closes early.
> 
> The NASDAQ 100 Index includes 100 of the largest domestic and international non-financial securities listed on The NASDAQ Stock Market based on market capitalization.

## Analysis and Context:

The article attributes the volume spike to likely index rebalancing and trade desk flows, noting that sector momentum in Technology and Communication Services supported NASDAQ-100 flows.

The ten observations above are the only ones retrieved in the current search sweep; they cover 3 February 2026 through 17 February 2026. The original request, however, spans 1 December 2025 through 17 February 2026—54 trading sessions in total. Closing prices for the 44 sessions between 1 December 2025 and 2 February 2026 are still outstanding and will need to be pulled directly from the FRED series “NASDAQ100” once accessible.

Trend assessment (1 December 2025 → 17 February 2026)

• Direction and magnitude  
  – The NASDAQ-100 rallied from the low-23 000s in early December (inferred from the 6-month mean of 23 039.89 supplied by Yahoo Finance) to an all-time high of 26 119.85 on 15 January 2026, a gain of roughly 13 %.  
  – A corrective phase began mid-January; by 17 February the index had retraced 5.4 % to 24 701.60 (yFinance, FRED).  
  – Despite the pull-back, all widely watched moving averages (20-, 50-, 100- and 200-day) remain positively stacked and rising, preserving the intermediate up-trend bias (Capital.com technical briefing cited previously).

• Momentum  
  – Average Directional Index (ADX) has eased to 12.4, indicating the market is consolidating rather than trending forcefully (Capital.com).

• Technical levels to watch  
  – Resistance: 25 500 (early-February congestion zone) and the record high at 26 119.85.  
  – Support: the 50-day SMA near 24 400 and the December breakout level at 23 900.

Volatility snapshot

• Realised volatility  
  – Annualised standard deviation of daily log-returns since 2 January 2026 is 19 %, above the 1-year average of 17 % (yFinance calculations).

• Implied volatility  
  – Options expiring 18-20 February price the at-the-money 1-day move at ±1.5 % with IV in the 26.8–28.2 % range (yFinance).  
  – The dedicated volatility gauge for the NASDAQ-100, VXN, closed at 20.15 on the latest print (Yahoo Finance, ^VXN), close to its 12-month median and well below the panic zone (>30).  
  – Put-skew remains pronounced: for the 20 February expiry, put open-interest peaks at the distant 20 000 strike while call OI is clustered around 24 900–25 300, suggesting traders are hedging the tail risk of a deeper draw-down.

Overall, volatility is elevated relative to 2025 norms but far from stress levels witnessed during previous Fed-tightening scares, aligning with the “orderly correction within an up-trend” narrative.

Catalysts between 17 February and 26 February 2026

Macro / policy
1. 23 Feb – January Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) price index. As the Federal Reserve’s preferred inflation gauge, a miss could materially shift rate-cut expectations that directly feed into growth-stock valuations.
2. 24 Feb – Publication of the 28 January FOMC minutes. Markets will parse language for confirmation of a mid-2026 easing cycle or a more cautious stance.

Micro / index-heavyweight earnings
1. 19 Feb – Nvidia FY Q4 2026 results (weight ≈7 % of NDX). Guidance on AI-server demand can swing the entire tech complex.
2. 20 Feb – Broadcom Q1 2026 earnings (≈3 % weight). Offers read-through on custom AI silicon and networking capital expenditure.
3. 24 Feb – Costco FY Q2 2026 numbers; 25 Feb – Microsoft analyst day (Microsoft ≈10 % weight). Together they provide consumer-spending and enterprise-IT checkpoints.

Technical / positioning
• Monthly option expiration clusters on 19 Feb and weekly expiry on 21 Feb could pin the index around high-OI strikes (24.5-25.5 k) until gamma hedges roll off, potentially unleashing higher realised volatility afterwards.
• Nasdaq special-rebalance risk: no event is scheduled, but an announcement could surface if megacap weights again approach the 24 % cap.

Synthesis

The NASDAQ-100 has advanced about 4 % over the past six months, set a new record high in mid-January, and is currently digesting gains in a 5–6 % pull-back. Realised and implied volatilities have nudged higher but remain in historically moderate territory (realised 19 %, VXN 20.15). The medium-term bull structure is intact while short-term direction hinges on three forces:

• Macro data—chiefly PCE inflation—feeding into Fed policy expectations.  
• Earnings from Nvidia and Broadcom as AI-spending bellwethers, followed by Costco and Microsoft for consumer and enterprise demand signals.  
• Post-expiry positioning dynamics after 19–21 February.

A benign inflation print coupled with upbeat semiconductor guidance would likely reignite the up-trend and open a retest of 26 119. Conversely, an upside inflation surprise or disappointing chip commentary could deepen the correction toward the 23 900–24 000 breakout zone before the 26 February target date.

Remaining information gaps

1. Daily closing prices for 1 December 2025 through 2 February 2026 (44 trading sessions) are still required to complete the full price table. The FRED series “NASDAQ100” will supply the authoritative figures once queried for that date range.  
2. A fresh VXN reading for the immediate pre-26 February session would sharpen the realised-versus-implied comparison but is not critical to meet the original request.

With those additions, all aspects of the query—comprehensive price table, trend characterisation, volatility analysis, and catalyst timetable—will be fully satisfied.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
