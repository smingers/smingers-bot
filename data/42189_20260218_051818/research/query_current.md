Analysis:
To estimate the NASDAQ-100 closing level on 2026-02-26 I need the freshest information on: 
• Current index level and trend since early February 2026.  
• Market catalysts expected between now (Feb 18) and Feb 26—e.g., Fed minutes (Feb 19), major earnings (Nvidia, Palo Alto Networks, etc.), PCE release (Feb 23), option-expiration positioning, macro data, and any geopolitical or regulatory developments that could sway mega-cap tech.  
• Short-term technical analysis (support/resistance targets, option-gamma pinning).  
• Sentiment from strategists about upside exhaustion versus melt-up continuation.  

News and commentary from the last few days are therefore most valuable. Broad web search captures forecasts and technical blogs; Google News narrows to very recent market pieces; AskNews can pull analyst notes and previews focusing on the next week.
