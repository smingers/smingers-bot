Analysis:
The value the index prints on 26 Feb 2026 will mainly be driven by (a) the short-term price trend during the days immediately before the fixing, (b) near-dated macro catalysts—Fed speeches, PCE inflation release on 2-23, large-cap tech earnings still due the week of 2-19, and (c) prevailing risk sentiment and positioning.  
To build an outside view I first need a clean run of recent daily closes and basic return statistics (1-week, 1-month, drawdowns) together with the historical distribution of 8-day moves. Next I want commentary and news flow that could move the market between now and the target date—e.g., articles about the February 2026 rally, analyst targets, or warnings. Finally, I will pull the FRED series itself so I can compute the exact recent path and volatility.
