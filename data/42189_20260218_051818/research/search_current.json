The average true range for the Dow is 662.27, and movements exceeding this level indicate market stress.

Short interest rose by approximately $3 billion during the same period, as fund managers trimmed long holdings amid growing concerns about artificial intelligence (AI) disruption.

S&P 500 futures fell 0.3% and Dow Jones Industrial Average futures declined 0.1% in early trading. AI-related fears have spread beyond technology into sectors such as wealth management, transportation, and logistics, as investors assess how automation and machine learning will reshape business models. Morgan Stanley strategists, led by Michael Wilson, argue that current market volatility is normal during major investment cycles, despite AI disruption concerns. They acknowledge investor anxiety but view AI as a structural driver of growth in infrastructure and computing, with potential efficiency gains and improved profit margins. However, rapid AI advancement poses risks, including accelerated sector disruption and leadership shifts. Software companies with distant cash flows are facing disproportionate selling pressure. The January Consumer Price Index came in below expectations, indicating cooling inflation, but growth concerns and sectoral disruption dominated market sentiment. Upcoming data includes the Personal Consumption Expenditures index (Friday) and Federal Reserve meeting minutes (Wednesday).\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 12:45 PM\nSource:[Blockonomi](https://blockonomi.com/investors-pull-7-billion-from-nasdaq-100-futures-as-ai-fears-intensify/)\n\n**Adobe, Costar, and PayPal: New Trend Signals Emerge for These NASDAQ-100 Stocks**\nAs of 22:30 CET on February 17, 2026, the NASDAQ-100 index stood at 24,732.7 points, unchanged.

With U.S. exchanges closed for Presidents Day, technology-focused stocks came under pressure as investors reduced exposure to sectors linked to technology and artificial intelligence (AI), driven by concerns over AI's potential impact on corporate profits. According to the Wall Street Journal, software, financial services, and transportation companies have been targeted in sell-offs due to fears that new AI models could disrupt market dynamics. The Nasdaq and S&P 500 are both in negative territory year-to-date. Investors are shifting focus toward upcoming economic indicators and corporate earnings, including the U.S. Q4 2025 GDP, housing, industrial and services data, inflation figures, and Federal Reserve meeting minutes. The earnings season is nearing its end, with most S&P 500 companies having reported; upcoming results include those from Walmart, Moody's, DoorDash, and Carvana. In Europe, the Stoxx Europe 600 rose slightly, and the FTSE 100 closed at a new high. In Asia, the Nikkei 225 declined, while the Hang Seng Index advanced. Markets in mainland China, South Korea, Taiwan, and Vietnam remained closed due to holidays, as did those in Brazil and Canada. The U.S. dollar strengthened, Bitcoin fluctuated near $68,000, gold fell but remained above $5,000 per ounce, and Brent crude oil rose amid expectations of renewed U.S.-Iran talks.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 05:46 PM\nSource:[Exame](https://exame.com/invest/mercados/nasdaq-cai-com-vendas-em-tecnologia-e-foco-em-dados-dos-eua/)\n\n**Direxion NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Shares (NASDAQ:QQQE) Short Interest Update**\nDirexion NASDAQ-100 Equal Weighted Index Shares (NASDAQ: QQQE) saw new institutional investments in the second and fourth quarters of 2025, according to a report dated February 16, 2026.

The index has tested the 26,180-point resistance\u2014marking the top of the consolidation zone\u2014without breaking through, indicating a balanced market debate between buyers expecting a breakout and sellers targeting lower entry points. The first key support level for the Nasdaq 100 is at 24,950 points, with the S&P 500\u2019s at 6,790. A clear breach below these levels would signal a potential shift toward a bearish trend, with the next major support at the November 2023 lows near 23,850 points\u2014representing a potential 5% drop. However, the AI-driven rally remains intact as long as these minimums hold. A deeper correction, such as a drop below 23,850 (Nasdaq 100) or 6,500 (S&P 500), would trigger a need for more defensive risk management, possibly leading to a 10\u201315% correction or even a 50% retracement of the April 2024 rally, potentially extending to 21,750 points. In such a scenario, the market could further test the gap between 20,000 and 20,800 points, creating a new buying opportunity. The recommended strategy is 'acorde\u00f3n' management: slightly reduce exposure if early supports are lost, further reduce if the trend deteriorates, and be ready to re-enter when the market stabilizes. The key is managing the process, not predicting the end. The AI rally is not at risk as long as the November 2023 lows are respected.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 02, 2026 05:13 AM\nSource:[elEconomista.es](https://www.eleconomista.es/mercados-cotizaciones/noticias/13752722/01/26/nasdaq-100-un-5-que-lo-decide-todo.html)\n\n**Nasdaq 100 Analysis: After Nervous Spell, Contemplation Of New Highs**\nThe Nasdaq 100 is approaching the 25,875.00 level in pre-market futures, with key resistance at 25,900.00. The index has shown renewed strength after a period of nervousness and reversals in recent months, and a sustained break above 25,900.00 could boost confidence among large traders and reignite speculation about new highs, potentially reaching levels seen in early November. The index, which had dipped below 25,000.00 on January 20, 2026, has since surged significantly, demonstrating renewed upward velocity. While concerns about an AI bubble and concentration in a few large tech stocks have quieted, market participants are now focused on the upcoming Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting, where the Fed is expected to maintain current interest rates but will be closely watched for shifts in tone. With a leadership change at the Fed scheduled for May 2026, financial institutions anticipate a more dovish policy stance, which could support equities. The broader U.S. market has performed well, though the Nasdaq 100 has lagged behind the S&P 500 in recent months. Traders are advised to remain cautious, as sentiment can shift quickly, but near-term upside momentum appears logical.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 27, 2026 11:45 AM\nSource:[TalkMarkets - Stocks](https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/nasdaq-100-analysis-after-nervous-spell-contemplation-of-new-highs?post=552897)\n\n**Nasdaq-100 Index: Facing a New Volatility Impulse?**\nThe Nasdaq-100\u00ae index has been trading in a narrow range since late October, with Bollinger Bands narrowing significantly\u2014currently at 25,902 (upper) and 25,119 (lower) points\u2014indicating reduced volatility. Historically, such a compression has preceded a strong trend impulse. A breakout above the short-term correction trend at 25,825 points could trigger upward momentum toward a new all-time high beyond 26,182 points. Conversely, a break below the key trendline at 24,312 points\u2014connecting lows since summer 2025\u2014would significantly increase the risk of an upward trend reversal. The index is thus entering a 'make or break' phase, where decisive action is expected.

The author maintains a strong conviction that the index will rise further, citing low trading volume and reduced market conviction due to the upcoming New Year\u2019s holiday. A breakout above 26,000 is seen as the catalyst for a significant upward move. The author expresses no interest in shorting the market and believes a meaningful shift would only occur if the index falls below 23,250\u2014currently considered unlikely. Long-term, the Nasdaq 100 is projected to approach 30,000 by 2026, supported by continued passive investment in artificial intelligence stocks, which remain a central driver of market momentum.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 31, 2025 04:15 PM\nSource:[TalkMarkets - Stocks](https://talkmarkets.com/content/stocks--equities/nasdaq-100-analysis-nasdaq-100-continues-to-grind?post=547627)\n\n**Nasdaq 100: Will the Recovery Hold? | Investing.com India**\nThe Nasdaq 100 has shown a strong recovery following a three-week sell-off, with Nasdaq 100 futures indicating a stable open and the index breaking above the 25,000 level. This rebound is driven by renewed optimism over potential interest rate cuts, fueled by dovish expectations surrounding Kevin Hassett\u2019s likely appointment as Fed Chair, which could lower the expected terminal rate and increase the probability of rate cuts in 2026. Investor sentiment has been bolstered by weak US economic data\u2014slightly disappointing retail sales, stable producer prices, and waning consumer confidence\u2014leading to an 85% chance of a 25-basis-point rate cut in December. The rally has been supported by rising shares of Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), driven by its AI-focused strategy. However, risks remain balanced: concerns over elevated national debt levels (notably in Japan), potential economic weakness impacting corporate profits, and valuation pressures persist. Technically, the Nasdaq 100 is testing the broken bullish trend line from summer, with key resistance at 25,200\u201325,300 and next targets at 25,480 and 26,000. Support lies at 25,000, with further levels at 24,900 and 24,500; the critical zone tested on Friday remains between 23,845 and 24,160. The market\u2019s next move hinges on whether it can reclaim the broken trend line to restore a bullish structure or continue rejecting it, risking renewed volatility. Meanwhile, ongoing peace talks between Ukraine, Russia, and the US\u2014led by Steve Witkoff\u2014could influence risk sentiment and energy prices, though no breakthrough has been confirmed.

The rally, fueled by gains in AI-focused stocks like Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL), has led to Nasdaq 100 futures pointing to a stable open, with the index breaking above the 25,000 level. The index is now testing the underside of a bullish trend line established since early summer, which broke on Thursday but is being challenged again. Key resistance levels lie between 25,200\u201325,300, with further targets at 25,480 and 26,000. On the downside, initial support is at 25,000, followed by 24,900 and 24,500, with a critical support zone between 23,845 and 24,160 tested on Friday. Market sentiment remains balanced, with risks including economic weakness, elevated sovereign debt (e.g., Japan), and geopolitical uncertainty\u2014particularly around the Ukraine peace negotiations, where progress is still uncertain. Traders now assign an 85% probability to a 25-basis-point rate cut in December, with speculation growing that Kevin Hassett may replace Jerome Powell as Fed Chair, potentially lowering the expected terminal rate and increasing rate-cut expectations into 2026. While no reversal signs are evident yet, the recovery\u2019s sustainability hinges on the index\u2019s ability to reclaim the broken trend line. Valuation concerns and underlying economic fragility remain cautionary factors.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 02:16 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/nasdaq-100-will-the-recovery-hold-200670850)\n\n**Nasdaq 100: Pressure Downward As Cautious Sentiment Holding**\nThe Nasdaq 100 index is experiencing downward pressure, with the current price around 24,645.00, near the lows seen on November 7, 2025, when it touched approximately 24,600.00. After reaching a recent peak near 25,770.00 on Wednesday, November 12, 2025, the index faced renewed selling pressure, reversing gains despite a brief upward move on November 17, 2025, when it briefly approached 25,326.00. The index had previously surged to 26,300.00 in late October 2025 before declining, with earlier lows near 24,300.00 in mid-October. Sentiment has shifted from cautious to nervous, with early futures trading on November 18, 2025, indicating heightened market anxiety. Day traders are advised to manage risk carefully, as momentum remains weak and the market shows signs of bearish sentiment. The article notes that while volatile lows often lead to reversals, current selling pressure suggests a negative direction. The market may need to test key support levels from mid-October before large players consider the index oversold.
