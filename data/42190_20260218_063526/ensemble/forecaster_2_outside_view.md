**Agent Report:**
- Identifies critical gap: no actual Metaculus prediction timeseries data available
- Notes current prediction is exactly 80.00% as of Feb 16, 2026 (11 days before evaluation)
- Cites indirect evidence from Manifold Markets showing ~89% at some point in 2025
- Concludes forecast has likely spent considerable time above 80% threshold
- Highlights that 80% is "neither a hard ceiling nor a stable long-term mean"

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Metaculus community predictions near threshold values 11 days before resolution:**
   - Most directly relevant to the meta-question structure
   - Limited historical data on this specific pattern
   - Moderate suitability

2. **Metaculus predictions on space mission success (Artemis program specifically):**
   - Artemis I prediction trajectory could provide insights
   - Community has track record with NASA missions
   - High suitability for understanding forecaster behavior

3. **Community prediction movements following technical setbacks in space programs:**
   - Recent hydrogen leak is a concrete negative signal
   - Historical precedent: Artemis I had similar leaks but succeeded
   - High suitability for understanding near-term dynamics

4. **Metaculus predictions in final 11 days before resolution:**
   - General pattern: predictions tend to stabilize near resolution
   - But can shift significantly with late-breaking news
   - Moderate suitability

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** Metaculus predictions on high-profile space missions following technical setbacks, combined with behavior of predictions near threshold values close to resolution.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction Timeframe:** 11 days (February 16 to February 27, 2026)

**Key Temporal Factors:**

1. **Current Status (Feb 18, 2026):**
   - Rocket at pad, but wet dress rehearsal failed Feb 2-3
   - Launch delayed from February to March 6 at earliest
   - Second WDR scheduled for Feb 19, 2026 (per Space.com)
   - Resolution date (Feb 27) falls BEFORE earliest possible launch date (March 6)

2. **Information Flow in Next 11 Days:**
   - Second wet dress rehearsal results (Feb 19) will be critical
   - If successful: positive signal, prediction likely rises
   - If fails again: negative signal, prediction likely falls
   - NASA may announce more specific launch date or further delays

3. **Historical Pattern:**
   - Agent report suggests prediction was ~89% in late 2025
   - Dropped to exactly 80% by Feb 16, 2026
   - This 9 percentage point drop likely reflects the Feb 2-3 WDR failure
   - Suggests community is responsive to technical news

**(d) Justification:**

The meta-question asks whether the community prediction will be **higher than 80.00%** on February 27, 2026.

**Key Considerations:**

1. **Current Position:** The prediction sits exactly at the threshold (80.00%) as of Feb 16, 2026. This is a knife-edge position.

2. **Recent Trajectory:** The prediction likely fell from ~89% to 80% following the Feb 2-3 wet dress rehearsal failure. This 9-point drop over ~2 weeks suggests the community is actively updating on technical news.

3. **Upcoming Information:** The second wet dress rehearsal on Feb 19 (just 8 days before resolution) will provide crucial new information:
   - Success → likely pushes prediction above 80%
   - Failure → likely pushes prediction below 80%
   - Mixed results → prediction remains near 80%

4. **Base Rate Considerations:**
   - Artemis I had similar hydrogen leaks during testing but ultimately succeeded
   - The underlying mission (Artemis II) still has strong fundamentals
   - Launch window extends through April 2026, providing buffer
   - No fundamental show-stoppers identified, just recurring technical issues

5. **Forecaster Psychology:**
   - At exactly 80%, forecasters are maximally uncertain about threshold crossing
   - Small positive news could tip prediction above 80%
   - Small negative news could tip prediction below 80%
   - The second WDR is the dominant information event before Feb 27

6. **Directional Bias:**
   - Recent trend is downward (89% → 80%)
   - But this may have already priced in the WDR failure
   - If second WDR succeeds, rebound is likely
   - If second WDR fails, further decline is likely

**Outside View Calibration:**

**(a) True Probability vs. Hedged Projection:**
I need to estimate the actual probability that the community prediction exceeds 80.00% on Feb 27, not express my confidence level.

**(b) Rough Figures to Tether To:**
- Current prediction: exactly 80.00%
- Recent high: ~89% (late 2025)
- Recent drop: ~9 percentage points over 2 weeks

**(c) Probability Precision:**
- 50% = even odds (maximum uncertainty)
- 60% = 3:2 odds (slight lean toward Yes)
- 70% = 7:3 odds (moderate confidence in Yes)
- 40% = 2:3 odds (slight lean toward No)

**(d) Rate of Upsets:**
Metaculus community predictions are generally well-calibrated, but:
- Technical space missions have inherent uncertainty
- Predictions near thresholds are inherently volatile
- Late-breaking news can cause significant shifts
- The second WDR (Feb 19) is a major information event

**Calibration Logic:**

The central question is: What will the second wet dress rehearsal on Feb 19 reveal?

**Scenario Analysis:**

1. **Second WDR succeeds cleanly (35% probability):**
   - Strong positive signal
   - Prediction likely rebounds to 85-90%
   - Result: prediction > 80% ✓

2. **Second WDR has minor issues but completes (30% probability):**
   - Mixed signal
   - Prediction likely stays 78-83%
   - Result: ~50% chance prediction > 80%

3. **Second WDR fails significantly (25% probability):**
   - Strong negative signal
   - Prediction likely drops to 70-75%
   - Result: prediction < 80% ✗

4. **Second WDR postponed or no clear result by Feb 27 (10% probability):**
   - Ambiguous signal
   - Prediction likely stays near 80%
   - Result: ~50% chance prediction > 80%

**Expected Probability Calculation:**
- P(>80%) = 0.35×1.0 + 0.30×0.5 + 0.25×0.0 + 0.10×0.5
- P(>80%) = 0.35 + 0.15 + 0.0 + 0.05 = 0.55

However, this assumes the second WDR is the only information. Other factors:
- NASA may provide additional updates
- Forecasters may gradually update even without major news
- The prediction's exact position at 80.00% suggests balanced uncertainty

**Adjustment:** Given the knife-edge position and the dominance of the Feb 19 WDR as an information event, I estimate a slight lean toward the prediction rising above 80%, but with substantial uncertainty.
