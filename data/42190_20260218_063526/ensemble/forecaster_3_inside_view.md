Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / alignment with resolution criteria  
This resolves **Yes** iff the Metaculus community prediction (CP) for “Artemis II completes successfully before 2027” is **strictly > 80.00%** at **2026-02-27 18:42 UTC**; **80.00% or lower = No**.

(a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; date)
- BBC Sky at Night Magazine (2026-02-03): Reports Artemis II Feb attempts scrubbed; March at earliest; details WDR issues (LH2 leak, comms dropouts, valve retorquing). Good secondary journalism; plausible technical details; not authoritative on final schedule.  
- NASA official blog (2026-02-17): Announces/updates ongoing WDR countdown; describes planned procedures; explicitly says launch timing/target set after data review; mentions potential March opportunity. Highest credibility for factual status and process, not for probability.  
- The Planetary Society explainer (date not shown in snippet; appears 2026 context): Provides launch windows (March/April) and mission overview; reputable space outreach org; likely accurate but secondary.  
- The Register (2026-02-16): “Mixed results” from confidence test; reduced LH2 flow suspected due to a ground equipment filter (replaced). Credible tech reporting, but still secondary and slightly interpretive.  
- Spaceanddefense.io (2026-02-03): Summarizes early WDR results and possible next steps (rollback vs proceed). Niche outlet; plausible but lower weight than NASA/major outlets.  
- Greater Milwaukee Today / Orlando Sentinel syndication (2026-02-17): Reports second WDR planned Feb 19–20; repeats leak history and March 6 earliest. Local journalism near KSC often solid on logistics; secondary.  
- AskNews items (Feb 16–18, 2026; mixed outlets incl. WRAL, SpaceDaily, FOX affiliate, ANSA, etc.): Mostly reiterations of the same facts (2nd WDR, filter replacement, March 6 earliest). Generally consistent; quality varies by outlet; weight mainly from convergence, not from any single sensational claim.  
- okdiario.com item (2026-02-17): Clickbait framing; adds little; low weight.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
Strong evidence
- NASA confirms WDR is underway (Feb 17) and a March opportunity is in play, with launch date set after WDR data review. This strongly supports: “NASA still driving toward 2026 launch,” which tends to keep the underlying Artemis-II-before-2027 success probability high.
- Multiple independent sources agree: **second WDR Feb 19–20** and **March 6 is earliest plausible launch**. This convergence makes it likely the next 7–10 days bring **new, forecast-relevant information** (WDR outcome) that can move the CP off exactly 80.

Moderate evidence
- Recurrent LH2/ground equipment problems (Register + multiple secondaries) but with concrete remediation (seal + filter replacement). Moderately suggests risk of another partial failure or further delay, which would push CP down.
- Historical pattern: Artemis I had similar hydrogen leak headaches but ultimately flew successfully. Moderately suggests that a “messy pad campaign” does not imply “mission slips beyond 2026/into 2027.”

Weak evidence
- Any single outlet’s implied optimism/pessimism about “we are/aren’t ready” beyond what NASA states.
- General “big program = delays” intuition over this very short horizon (9 days) for the *meta*-question (CP > 80), which is dominated by near-term news and forecaster behavior.

Key meta-point: this is not “Will Artemis II succeed?” but “Will Metaculus CP be >80% on Feb 27?” The dominant causal driver is whether the Feb 19–20 WDR yields a “clean enough” outcome to boost forecasters above the knife-edge.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left: ~9 days (from 2026-02-18 to 2026-02-27 18:42 UTC).
- If halved (~4–5 days): much less time for WDR results to be digested and for forecasts to shift; I’d move probability **down** (more likely CP remains stuck at/near 80.00, yielding No).
- If doubled (~18 days): more time for WDR outcome + any NASA statements/FRR scheduling to propagate; I’d move probability **up** (more chances CP drifts away from exactly 80, and “good-enough” news tends to lift it above).

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustments vs outside-view base rate)
Outside view base rate was 57% (slight lean to CP ending up >80). Since then, the information set is broadly consistent: NASA is proceeding with the second WDR with identified fixes (filter replaced), and many sources converge on March 6 earliest.

Two offsetting inside-view considerations push in opposite directions:
- Upward pressure: The mere fact NASA is running the second WDR on schedule with a specific fix applied makes a “non-disaster” outcome somewhat more likely than a full repeat failure, which would tend to lift CP above 80.
- Downward pressure (important for this wrapper question): The threshold is **strictly greater than** 80.00%. Starting from **exactly 80.00%**, “no movement / minimal movement / rounding-stickiness” becomes a meaningful path to **No** even if sentiment is slightly positive. Also, if WDR results are “mixed but acceptable,” forecasters may not push much above 80 by Feb 27.

Net: I make a small downward adjustment from 57% to reflect (i) strict inequality + (ii) realistic chance CP remains at ~80.0 even with only mildly positive updates.

Probability calibration
- Status quo if nothing changes: CP stays at ~80.00% ⇒ resolves **No**. Given inertia/median behavior, this is a serious possibility over 9 days.
- Main swing factor: headline interpretation of the Feb 19–20 WDR (clean pass vs notable issues vs scrub/rollback).
- My inside-view mixture (intuitive):
  - “Clean-ish WDR / clear progress” leading to CP >80: ~40%
  - “Mixed/ambiguous WDR” leaving CP around 79.5–80.5 with a big mass near exactly 80.0: ~35%
  - “Bad WDR / obvious continuing fueling issue” pushing CP <80: ~25%
Given the strict ‘>80.00’ condition and stickiness near 80, this yields only a slight edge to Yes.

Checklist:
1. Criteria check: Yes iff target Metaculus CP at 2026-02-27 18:42 UTC is strictly >80.00%; else No (or mirrors target if it resolves early).  
2. Outside view base rate: 57%.  
3. Consistency line: 54 out of 100 times, the CP on Feb 27 is >80.00%.  
4. Key evidence (3–5):
   - NASA (Feb 17) confirms WDR underway; launch date after review; March opportunity mentioned.
   - Multiple outlets: second WDR Feb 19–20; March 6 earliest launch window.
   - Identified ground equipment issue (filter) replaced; suggests some improved odds of WDR progress.
   - CP currently exactly 80.00%, and strict “>80.00” makes “stays at 80.00” a decisive No-path.  
5. Blind spot: A clearly successful WDR + NASA confidently reiterates March 6 (or near) could trigger a fast herding jump to mid/high-80s, making my 54% too low.  
6. Status quo outcome: CP staying ~80.00% is plausible over 9 days; that nudges against Yes.

Probability: 54%
