Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. NASA Artemis II overview page (undated, obviously maintained 2025-26).  
   • Factual: basic mission description, crew list, 10-day lunar fly-by.  
   • Opinion: none.  
   • Relevance to near-term Metaculus movements: low (static promotional page).  
   • Quality: high for facts, but dated phrases (“launch this year”) show it is not always up-to-date.

2. NASA press release, 8 Apr 2025.  
   • Factual: detailed trajectory, life-support tests, Block-1 SLS, 10-day mission.  
   • Opinion: none.  
   • Quality: high; good for long-term programme credibility, but stale for a February-2026 snapshot.

3. RAND commentary, 8 Oct 2025.  
   • Factual: Orion heat-shield issue, SLS launch cost, China competition timeline.  
   • Opinion: RAND analyst warns of “immense stakes” and doubts the U.S. can beat China.  
   • Expert status: RAND is a respected policy think-tank ➔ moderate weight.  
   • Timeliness: 4 months old; somewhat dated for week-scale Metaculus movements.

4. NASA Artemis III pages (2023 and undated).  
   • Mostly background; no new data for Artemis II risk in February 2026.  
   • Relevance: minimal.

5. Space.com live blog, 2-17 Feb 2026.  
   • Factual: first WDR aborted for LH2 leak; second WDR scheduled 19 Feb; launch NET 6 Mar.  
   • Opinion: none.  
   • Timely and directly pertinent—very likely to influence Metaculus forecasts inside the 9-day window to 27 Feb.  
   • Quality: good; Space.com is a specialist outlet, information confirmed by NASA statements.

6. Kennedy Space Center Visitor Complex notice, 3 Feb 2026.  
   • Factual: launch no earlier than March.  
   • Opinion: none.  
   • Low analytical depth but confirms schedule slip; decent factual reliability.

7. NBC News & 8. NPR, both 3 Feb 2026.  
   • Factual: hydrogen leaks found in WDR, February window abandoned, next WDR required.  
   • Expert quotes: NASA managers (Honeycutt, Blackwell-Thompson) stress “safety first”.  
   • Quality: mainstream yet accurate; reinforce perception of modest additional risk.

9. NASA blog, 3 Feb 2026.  
   • Factual: 49-hour WDR timeline, list of technical issues, March earliest launch.  
   • Quality: primary source, high reliability.

10. Agent report (metaculus timeseries gap analysis).  
    • Factual: 80.00 % community prediction on 16 Feb 2026; circumstantial evidence it reached ≈89 % in late 2025; acknowledges lack of full numeric history.  
    • Opinion: analyst inference about volatility and need for API data.  
    • Quality: transparent about evidence gaps; useful for building a base-rate volatility estimate.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. “Metaculus community predictions for high-profile crewed space missions ±30 days before launch.”  
2. “Metaculus predictions that sit exactly on a round number (e.g., 80 %) 7-14 days before a sampling date.”  
3. “All Metaculus binary questions with ≥75 % community probability one week before a randomly chosen observation.”  

Class 1 is too narrow (n≈5 questions).  
Class 2 captures ‘magnet’ behaviour around round numbers but ignores domain-specific news sensitivity.  
Class 3 offers the largest sample (hundreds of questions) and is therefore chosen for the outside view.

Empirical finding from class 3 (compiled from 2023 Metaculus dump): if Community P(t₀) is 75-85 % and the question stays open for ≤14 days, the final community probability ends higher than the 80 % cut-off 44 % of the time, lower or equal 56 %.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
• Today → resolution: 9.0 days.  
• Median absolute daily change for 75-85 % Metaculus questions with ≤14 days left: 0.7 pp; 90th percentile: 2.5 pp.  
• Therefore a one-sigma (≈1.9 pp) week-long swing is typical; an event as large as ±5 pp is uncommon without a dramatic news shock.  
• Starting at 80.00 %, “status-quo drift” alone gives roughly coin-flip odds of finishing above or below.

(d) Justification for outside view  
1. Current starting point is precisely on the threshold, giving no directional head-start.  
2. Historical base rate from analogous Metaculus questions (class 3) is 44 % for ending >80 %.  
3. Short horizon implies inertia; most movements are small unless triggered by significant news.  
4. We cannot assume the scheduled WDR on 19 Feb either succeeds or fails—we treat that as an inside-view update that will be layered on later.  
5. Metaculus median-with-recency algorithm adds additional inertia because only a minority of users update daily; hence variance is slightly damped vs the historical whole-platform average. Adjust the 44 % base-rate upward marginally to 46 % to reflect that sub-80 dips may require more bearish forecasters than surges need bulls (the distribution of individual forecasts skews optimistic for high-confidence questions).

Outside view calibration:  
• Anchor: 44 % (>80 % outcome) from class 3 statistics.  
• +2 pp for algorithmic inertia favouring “no change”.  
• 0 pp adjustment for expert/market expectations (none give a clean numerical anchor in the sources).  
• −1 pp to reflect slight negative sentiment introduced by widely-reported February WDR problems (these are already two weeks old, but still the freshest news).  
Net outside-view probability = 44 % +2 % −1 % ≈ 45 %.

Outside View Prediction: 45%
