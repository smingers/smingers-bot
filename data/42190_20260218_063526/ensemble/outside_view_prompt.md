Original fine print: 
> No fine print provided

Original background: 
> [Artemis II](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/) is NASA's attempt to return to the moon after over half a century. NASA [plans](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/nasas-first-flight-with-crew-important-step-on-long-term-return-to-the-moon-missions-to-mars/) to send 4 astronauts on a 10-day voyage around the moon, which will involve going approximately 4,700 miles (7,500 kilometers) beyond the far side of the moon. From that vantage point, the astronauts will be able to see moon with the earth in the background.&#x20;
> 
> An additional factor, beyond bringing humanity back to the moon, is a strong geopolitical rivalry [undercurrent](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/10/nasas-artemis-ii-mission-is-crucial-as-doubts-build.html) between the United States and China. China is targeting its own moon landing for \~2030. Assuming Artemis II is successful, the [Artemis III ](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-iii/)mission is [planned](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/artemis-iii/) to land humans on the moon again in 2027, the first time since 1972's Apollo 17 mission.
> 
> Artemis II consists of two main vehicles: [Orion](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/orion-spacecraft/) spacecraft that will carry the humans around the moon and the [Space Launch System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System) (SLS) super-heavy launch [rocket](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-launch-system/) that will lift the Orion into space. The uncrewed Artemis I test mission, launched at the end of 2022, successfully [went](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/view-the-best-images-from-nasas-artemis-i-mission/) around the moon though [had](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_I#Post-landing_analysis) some minor damage which caused delays in Artemis II.&#x20;
> 
> Originally [planned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_II#Launch_date) for 2019-2021, Artemis II was delayed until 2023, then September 2025, and then until April 2026. However, in March 2025, NASA [accelerated](https://www.americaspace.com/2025/03/22/nasa-accelerates-artemis-2-by-two-months/) the planned launch date to February 2026. As of December 5, 2025, NASA's official Artemis II mission page [said](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/) "No Later Than April 2026."

`{"format":"metaculus_binary_cp_rises","info":{"post_id":40864,"question_id":40521,"last_cp":0.8}}`

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40864) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-27 18:42:00 is higher than 80.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 80.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-27 18:42:00, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

# Summary of NBC News Article: "NASA delays Artemis II moon launch after issues during rehearsal"

**Date:** February 03, 2026

## Key Facts and Developments:

**Technical Issues During Wet Dress Rehearsal:**
- NASA detected leaking hydrogen at the base of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket during a "wet dress rehearsal" at Kennedy Space Center in Florida
- The test was ended with approximately 5 minutes and 15 seconds remaining in the simulated launch countdown
- Hydrogen leaks occurred multiple times: twice during the fueling process (which began around 12:30 p.m. ET on Monday) and again in the final minutes of the countdown
- The rocket's automated systems stopped the countdown due to a spike in the liquid hydrogen leak rate
- Additional audio issues in communications channels used by ground teams were also identified

**Launch Schedule Changes:**
- NASA announced shortly after 2 a.m. ET on Tuesday that it would forgo February's launch window (which lasted until Feb. 11)
- The agency will now aim for March "as the earliest possible launch opportunity"
- Specific launch opportunities are available: March 6-9 and March 11, with additional dates in April if needed
- Teams will review data and conduct another wet dress rehearsal before the next launch attempt

**Wet Dress Rehearsal Details:**
- The hourslong rehearsal involved filling the rocket with more than 700,000 gallons of cryogenic propellant
- The process simulated each step of the launch countdown as it would occur on the actual launch day

**Crew Status:**
- The four astronauts (NASA astronauts Reid Wiseman, Christina Koch, Victor Glover, and Canadian astronaut Jeremy Hansen) had been in quarantine in Houston since Jan. 21
- They were released from quarantine on Tuesday and will remain in Houston
- The crew will resume training on Wednesday
- They are expected to enter quarantine again roughly two weeks before the next targeted launch opportunity

**Official Statements:**

- **John Honeycutt** (Artemis II mission management team chair): Characterized the rehearsal as an opportunity for "the rocket to talk to us," noting the test is designed to assess performance "before we ask our crew to go fly on launch day"

- **NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman**: "With more than three years between SLS launches, we fully anticipated encountering challenges. That is precisely why we conduct a wet dress rehearsal. These tests are designed to surface issues before flight and set up launch day with the highest probability of success." He emphasized that "safety remains our top priority" and NASA "will only launch when we believe we are ready to undertake this historic mission"

- **Lori Glaze** (acting associate administrator for NASA's Exploration Systems Development Mission Directorate): Said teams need to analyze full results before scheduling another practice run; work is proceeding at the launch pad, but if more extensive repairs are needed, NASA could roll the rocket back to the Vehicle Assembly Building, which would likely result in further delays

- **Artemis launch director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson**: Indicated they will determine the next wet dress rehearsal timing after analysis

- **Reid Wiseman** (astronaut): Expressed "immense pride seeing the rocket reach 100% fuel load last night"

**Historical Context:**
- The SLS booster and Orion spacecraft have never launched with astronauts onboard and haven't flown since late 2022
- A previous uncrewed Artemis I flight around the moon in 2022 was delayed six months because of similar hydrogen leaks identified during its first wet dress rehearsal
- Artemis II will be the second trip to space for NASA's SLS rocket and Orion capsule, but the first time they carry humans

## Issues Discovered During Testing:

During Monday's wet dress rehearsal at Kennedy Space Center in Florida, several problems were identified:

1. **Hydrogen Leak:** About an hour into testing, sensors detected a hydrogen leak in the super-chilled hydrogen fuel system for the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. When the team attempted to pressurize the tank after troubleshooting the initial leak, another leak appeared quickly.

2. **Orion Capsule Valve Problem:** A valve that pressurizes the vehicle required additional attention, and closing the hatch took longer than anticipated.

3. **Additional Technical Issues:** Problems with cameras due to cold weather and audio dropouts across communication channels.

## Named Source Quotes:

- **Launch Director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson:** Described the leak issue during pressurization and characterized the day as "a very successful day for us on many fronts" while acknowledging "we got some work we've got to go do."

- **NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman:** Posted on X that "safety remains our top priority, for our astronauts, our workforce, our systems and the public," and that NASA will only launch when ready.

## Context:

- Hydrogen leaks previously plagued testing of NASA's Artemis I mission in 2022
- Lessons learned from the uncrewed Artemis I flight were utilized for Artemis II
- NASA will require another wet dress rehearsal before authorizing astronauts to board
- The crew was released from quarantine and will remain in Houston, re-entering quarantine 14 days before the next launch attempt
- This would be the first crewed mission to the Moon in more than 50 years (since Apollo 17 in 1972)

     – 23 Sep 2025: senior officials confirmed a launch window opening 5 Feb 2026 (Ars Technica, 23 Sep 2025).  
     – 26 Sep 2025: NASA repeated the “no earlier than 5 Feb 2026” goal and “no later than April 2026” limit (Universe Today, 26 Sep 2025).  
   • These milestones fall squarely inside the February-2025 → February-2026 interval of interest, making them useful anchor dates for reading forecast movements once the numerical history is obtained.

3. Indirect evidence that the forecast has exceeded 80 % at least once before 2026-02-16  
   • A Manifold Markets mirror of the Metaculus question cites a “current 89 %” community estimate, with reasoning that a further slip past 2026 is the main downside risk (Manifold, undated but clearly sometime after March 2025 because it discusses the 2026 launch window).  
   • While Manifold is a separate platform, its creator explicitly states that the market “resolves according to Metaculus resolution,” and Manifold questions of this type are seeded by scraping the live Metaculus community percentage. Hence the 89 % figure is strong circumstantial evidence that Metaculus itself was near 89 % on that day.  
   • Because the cited Manifold commentary mentions the stacked SLS-Orion vehicle and a completed wet-dress rehearsal, it must post-date the September 2025 NASA briefings. Therefore the Metaculus prediction almost certainly crossed well above 80 % in the second half of 2025.

4. Availability of a primary data source  
   • Several developer guides and wrappers (e.g., the Ergo-Ought Python wrapper and the NYC-Servers API walkthrough referenced in prior analysis) confirm that Metaculus exposes a /questions/{id}/prediction_timeseries endpoint requiring authentication. That endpoint is the authoritative source for every community-prediction datapoint, including timestamps and percent values, and is therefore necessary for a rigorous reconstruction.

Limitations of the current evidence base

• None of the search results supplies the actual prediction_timeseries JSON, nor even a screenshot of the Metaculus chart.  
• We still lack specific daily or weekly percentage values between 1 Feb 2025 and 27 Feb 2026.  
• Consequently, we cannot yet draw the detailed time-series graph, identify the exact date of the first breach of the 80 % level, or quantify dwell time above/below that threshold.  
• No documentation surfaced that Metaculus changed its weighting or aggregation methodology during the period, but this absence of evidence is not confirmation. Verification inside the API payload’s metadata (or the question’s change log) is still needed.

Synthesis relative to the downstream forecasting problem

The downstream yes/no forecast hinges on whether the community prediction on 2026-02-27 is greater than 80.00 %. The single observation we possess (80.00 % on 2026-02-16) shows the forecast perched exactly on the knife-edge 11 days beforehand. Indirect corroboration (Manifold’s 89 %) indicates that the community has been comfortable at levels materially above 80 % in the recent past. However, without the complete timeline we cannot evaluate:

• The variance of the series—does it oscillate in a 70–90 % band or plateau close to 80 %?  
• The persistence of shocks—do schedule updates move the needle for days, weeks, or hours?  
• The frequency and duration of sub-80 % dips, which would be essential for assigning probabilities to a renewed decline before 27 Feb 2026.

In short, the qualitative evidence suggests that 80 % is neither a hard ceiling nor a stable long-term mean; rather, the community prediction has probably spent considerable time above that mark. Nevertheless, quantitative confirmation is still missing.

Information still needed to fully satisfy the original query

1. Complete prediction_timeseries data for question #40864 covering at least 01 Feb 2025 → 16 Feb 2026, ideally through 27 Feb 2026 once available.  
2. Verification of any methodological changes to the community forecast calculation over that span.  
3. Exact timestamps and values for the forecast on or around:
   • 22 Mar 2025 (launch acceleration)  
   • 05 Dec 2025 (NASA “No Later Than April 2026” update)  
   • 23–26 Sep 2025 (February 2026 launch target confirmation)  
   • Any other large news items documented in NASA press releases.  
4. Concrete dates when the forecast crossed the 80 % threshold upward or downward, including the amplitude of each excursion.

Until those numerical records are obtained, any statistical characterization—trend analysis, volatility estimate, or threshold crossing count—remains speculative.

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
