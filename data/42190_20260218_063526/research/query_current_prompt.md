The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 80.00% on 2026-02-27 for the Metaculus question "Will NASA's Artemis II complete its mission successfully before 2027?"?

Question background:
Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency.

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40864
- Original question title: Will NASA's Artemis II complete its mission successfully before 2027?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 80.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as **Yes** if Artemis II achieves a closest-approach altitude ≤20,000 km above the lunar surface during the mission and returns to Earth with no loss of crew before January 1, 2027.

Original fine print: 
> No fine print provided

Original background: 
> [Artemis II](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/) is NASA's attempt to return to the moon after over half a century. NASA [plans](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/nasas-first-flight-with-crew-important-step-on-long-term-return-to-the-moon-missions-to-mars/) to send 4 astronauts on a 10-day voyage around the moon, which will involve going approximately 4,700 miles (7,500 kilometers) beyond the far side of the moon. From that vantage point, the astronauts will be able to see moon with the earth in the background.&#x20;
> 
> An additional factor, beyond bringing humanity back to the moon, is a strong geopolitical rivalry [undercurrent](https://www.rand.org/pubs/commentary/2025/10/nasas-artemis-ii-mission-is-crucial-as-doubts-build.html) between the United States and China. China is targeting its own moon landing for \~2030. Assuming Artemis II is successful, the [Artemis III ](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-iii/)mission is [planned](https://www.nasa.gov/missions/artemis/artemis-iii/) to land humans on the moon again in 2027, the first time since 1972's Apollo 17 mission.
> 
> Artemis II consists of two main vehicles: [Orion](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/orion-spacecraft/) spacecraft that will carry the humans around the moon and the [Space Launch System](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space_Launch_System) (SLS) super-heavy launch [rocket](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/space-launch-system/) that will lift the Orion into space. The uncrewed Artemis I test mission, launched at the end of 2022, successfully [went](https://www.nasa.gov/humans-in-space/view-the-best-images-from-nasas-artemis-i-mission/) around the moon though [had](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_I#Post-landing_analysis) some minor damage which caused delays in Artemis II.&#x20;
> 
> Originally [planned](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artemis_II#Launch_date) for 2019-2021, Artemis II was delayed until 2023, then September 2025, and then until April 2026. However, in March 2025, NASA [accelerated](https://www.americaspace.com/2025/03/22/nasa-accelerates-artemis-2-by-two-months/) the planned launch date to February 2026. As of December 5, 2025, NASA's official Artemis II mission page [said](https://www.nasa.gov/mission/artemis-ii/) "No Later Than April 2026."

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40864) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-27 18:42:00 is higher than 80.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 80.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-27 18:42:00, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.
