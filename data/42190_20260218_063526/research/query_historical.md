Analysis:
The Metaculus community prediction can jump when fresh information appears about Artemis II’s schedule, technical readiness, safety concerns, or broader NASA funding and political support.  To judge whether the prediction is likely to rise above 80 % by 2026-02-27, it helps to know:
• How the community forecast has trended in the past after schedule slips or positive milestones (e.g., completion of Orion environmental tests, SLS stage stacking, crew training milestones).  
• Whether any new issues, audits, or congressional testimony surfaced in early 2026 that could lower confidence.  
• Whether NASA, contractors, or the press have reported successful risk-retirement steps in the weeks just before 2026-02-27.  
Therefore I want (a) a historical chart or discussion of the Metaculus community prediction itself, (b) recent mainstream and specialist news from February 2026 about Artemis II delays or progress, and (c) background webpages (NASA press releases, expert blogs) that document the February 2026 launch target and any technical hurdles.
