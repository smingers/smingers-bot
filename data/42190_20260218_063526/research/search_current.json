mission officially began on February 18, 2026, at 00:50 CET (18:50 EST in Florida), marking 'L-49 hours and 40 minutes' before the simulated launch window set for 02:30 CET on Friday, February 20, 2026. The test simulates all launch phases except actual liftoff, with the 'wet' phase involving the loading of cryogenic propellants\u2014liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen\u2014into the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket's tanks at Kennedy Space Center. The exercise includes critical coordination between NASA teams, Houston\u2019s Mission Control, and other strategic centers. Key procedures include preparing temporary platforms for the Flight Termination System (FTS) to meet Eastern Range safety requirements. The countdown uses two timelines: L-time (continuous) and T-time (pausable during 'built-in holds'). During the test, the team will halt T-time at T-1 minute 30 seconds for 3 minutes, resume to T-33 seconds, then reset to T-10 minutes to simulate a technical issue requiring rapid recovery. Although astronauts are not physically on board, their presence is fully simulated, including the closeout crew practicing Orion module and Launch Abort System (LAS) hatch closures with precision. The test is expected to conclude around 06:30 CET on February 20, after which tanks will be drained and data analyzed. A successful test will allow NASA to confirm the official launch date for Artemis II, marking a pivotal step toward humanity\u2019s return to the Moon.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 06:04 AM\nSource:[MeteoWeb](https://www.meteoweb.eu/2026/02/artemis-ii-al-via-il-wet-dress-rehearsal-lultima-grande-prova-prima-del-ritorno-verso-la-luna/1001899066/)\n\n**Artemis II: NASA Confirms Start of Final Mission Test to the Moon**\nOn February 12, 2026, NASA conducted a partial fueling test for the Artemis II mission, during which engineers detected that a ground support equipment filter might be restricting liquid hydrogen flow. The component was replaced over the weekend, the line reconnected, and environmental conditions were restored to resume testing. Based on data from the partial test, engineers deemed it viable to proceed with a full 'wet dress rehearsal' this week. This simulation, known as a wet dress rehearsal, involves loading the rocket with liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, executing a countdown sequence, and draining the tanks, while also practicing abort procedures to simulate real-world launch suspensions. The countdown will begin at 8:40 p.m. Buenos Aires time on February 17, lasting nearly 50 hours, with the simulated launch scheduled for 10:30 p.m. on February 19, within a four-hour window. During the test, the final ten minutes of the countdown\u2014known as terminal count\u2014will be executed twice: the first time, the countdown will pause at T minus 1 minute and 30 seconds for up to three minutes, then resume until T minus 33 seconds before another pause; the second iteration will restart at T minus 10 minutes to repeat the sequence and advance just before T minus 30 seconds. This procedure allows teams to practice real-time scenarios and abort protocols. The Artemis II crew will not participate in the test, but technical staff will travel to the launch platform to practice closing Orion spacecraft hatches and other operations. The final launch date will not be confirmed until the rehearsal is successfully completed and all data are reviewed. According to current planning, March 6, 2026, is the first viable launch day, allowing time for a second wet dress rehearsal, technical analysis, and final preparations. Artemis II will be NASA\u2019s first crewed mission to the Moon since the Apollo era, orbiting the Moon without landing, serving as a critical precursor to future lunar landing missions.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 09:08 PM\nSource:[Todo Noticias](https://tn.com.ar/tecno/novedades/2026/02/17/artemis-ii-la-nasa-confirmo-el-inicio-del-ensayo-final-de-la-mision-a-la-luna/)\n\n**NASA to conduct 2nd rehearsal for possible moon mission this week**\nNASA is scheduled to conduct a second wet dress rehearsal for the Artemis II mission on Thursday, February 19, 2026, at the Kennedy Space Center. This full practice launch\u2014without liftoff\u2014will test the systems and procedures required to fuel and launch the 30-story Space Launch System (SLS) rocket with the Orion spacecraft. During the rehearsal, teams will load the rocket with hundreds of thousands of gallons of super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen, power up both vehicles, and simulate the entire countdown sequence up to just before engine ignition. The first wet dress rehearsal in early February 2026 revealed a liquid hydrogen leak near an umbilical connection, elevated hydrogen gas concentrations, and technical and communication issues during the countdown. Engineers have since replaced seals and filters, adjusted ground support equipment, and refined fueling and countdown procedures. Improvements were also informed by data from the Artemis I mission in 2022, which included five prior wet dress rehearsals. NASA aims to approve Artemis II for launch by March 2026, with the first launch window opening on March 6 and additional windows available in April. If delayed, future opportunities will depend on orbital alignment, with subsequent windows occurring later in the year. Artemis II will be the first crewed mission of NASA\u2019s Artemis program and the first human flight beyond low Earth orbit since the Apollo era, carrying four astronauts on a 10-day journey around the Moon and back.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 05:40 PM\nSource:[WRAL](https://www.wral.com/weather/nasa-artemis-ii-wet-dress-rehearsal-feb-2026/)\n\n**NASA teams set for second Artemis II wet dress rehearsal**\nNASA is preparing for the second wet dress rehearsal of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and Orion spacecraft ahead of the Artemis II test flight, scheduled for Thursday, February 19, 2026, at Kennedy Space Center in Florida. Teams replaced a filter in ground support equipment suspected of restricting liquid hydrogen flow during a partial fueling test on February 12. Engineers used data from that test to plan the full rehearsal, reconnected the liquid hydrogen line with the new filter, and restored required environmental conditions. The rehearsal will simulate a complete launch sequence, including loading cryogenic propellants into the SLS core and upper stage tanks, conducting a full countdown, recycling the countdown clock, and draining tanks to practice scrub procedures. Launch controllers will report to consoles at 6:40 p.m. EST on February 17, initiating a nearly 50-hour countdown. The simulated launch time is set for 8:30 p.m. on February 19, with a four-hour window to accommodate holds. Although the Artemis II crew will not participate directly, a dedicated team will rehearse Orion spacecraft closeout operations, including hatches closure. The rehearsal includes two full terminal count runs: the first pauses at T minus 1 minute 30 seconds for up to three minutes, resumes to T minus 33 seconds, pauses again, then recycles back to T minus 10 minutes to repeat; the second run proceeds to just inside T minus 30 seconds before ending. This allows simulation of real-world launch conditions and responses to scrubs. NASA will not commit to a specific Artemis II launch date until the rehearsal is successfully completed and data reviewed. Mission planners have identified an additional viable launch window in the first week of March, with March 6 now the earliest feasible launch date, allowing time for the rehearsal, data analysis, and transition to launch readiness. A live stream of the SLS and Orion stack is available online, with an additional video feed and status updates via the NASA Artemis blog during fueling day.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 11:21 AM\nSource:[SpaceDaily.Com](https://www.spacedaily.com/reports/NASA_teams_set_for_second_Artemis_II_wet_dress_rehearsal_999.html)\n\n**Luna, nuova prova generale per il lancio di Artemis II**\nNASA conducted a second 'wet dress rehearsal'\u2014a full-scale simulation of the Artemis II launch\u2014for the upcoming mission that will send four astronauts into lunar orbit. The test, lasting approximately 50 hours, began at midnight on February 18, 2026 (Italian time), with the critical simulation of launch countdown and engine ignition expected at 2:30 AM on February 20, 2026. The test involved loading about 2.65 million liters of propellant into the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket and then safely removing it, while practicing countdown procedures, including simulated aborts and restarts. This follows a previous rehearsal on February 3, 2026, which was delayed due to propellant leakage issues. NASA has since replaced a filter restricting hydrogen flow during a partial fueling test and is working to restore all necessary conditions for the rehearsal. The test, which does not involve actual astronauts, will be simulated by a team of four personnel performing astronaut-like tasks, including closing Orion capsule hatches. Data collected will be analyzed to confirm or adjust the Artemis II launch date, currently set for March 6, 2026.

The mission will carry four astronauts\u2014Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch (NASA), and Jeremy Hansen (CSA)\u2014on a 10-day journey around the Moon, reaching a distance of approximately 370,000 kilometers from Earth and flying 7,400 kilometers beyond the Moon. The mission will test Orion\u2019s life support systems, manual piloting capabilities, and thermal protection during high-speed reentry into Earth\u2019s atmosphere, culminating in a splashdown off the coast of San Diego, California. Scientific payloads will study deep space radiation and human health and behavior. As part of the 'Send Your Name with Artemis' initiative, anyone worldwide can register before January 21, 2026, to have their name stored on a memory chip aboard Orion. Participants receive a digital boarding pass as a keepsake. NASA emphasizes that Artemis II is a critical step toward future crewed missions to the Moon and Mars.

The mission will carry four astronauts on a 10-day journey around the Moon to test all critical systems. Originally scheduled for February 6, 2026, the launch was postponed to February 8 due to unfavorable weather. Further delays occurred after a liquid hydrogen leak was detected at the interface of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket\u2019s core stage during a previous wet dress rehearsal. NASA teams replaced a ground support filter that restricted liquid hydrogen flow during refueling, restored proper environmental conditions, and successfully resolved the issue. As of February 19, 2026, NASA plans to conduct the second wet dress rehearsal, involving cryogenic propellant loading, countdown simulation, countdown recycling demonstration, and tank purging to practice cleanup procedures. This rehearsal will guide launch and support teams through key operations ahead of the Artemis II launch.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 06:46 AM\nSource:[20 minutos](https://www.20minutos.es/tecnologia/actualidad/nasa-revela-fecha-prevista-artemis-ii-regreso-luna-sera-este-dia-marzo_6934984_0.html)\n\n**NASA Prepares SLS Rocket for Second Full Fueling Ahead of Artemis II Moon Mission**\nNASA is preparing for a second full 'wet dress rehearsal' (WDR) of the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket ahead of the Artemis II mission to the Moon. The second attempt, scheduled for 19 February 2026, will involve filling the SLS with over 2.65 million liters of liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen to test for leaks and validate system performance. This follows a failed first WDR on 3 February 2026, which was halted at T-5 minutes 15 seconds due to hydrogen leaks exceeding the 16% safety threshold. A previous rehearsal on 12 February tested new seals in the hydrogen fuelling system, but was disrupted by ground equipment issues that slowed hydrogen flow. The upcoming WDR aims to progress the countdown to T-1 minute 30 seconds, pause for 3 minutes, resume to T-33 seconds, pause again, and then return to T-10 minutes for a full simulation. The mission's launch date will be confirmed after a successful WDR, with the earliest possible launch set for 6 March 2026.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 03:14 AM\nSource:[iXBT.com](https://www.ixbt.com/news/2026/02/17/nasa-sls-artemis-ii.html)\n\n**Artemis II: NASA targets Feb. 19 for second moon mission fueling rehearsal**\nNASA is targeting Thursday, February 19, 2026, for the second wet dress rehearsal of the Artemis II mission at Kennedy Space Center, marking a critical step toward launching the first crewed lunar mission since the Apollo era. The nearly 50-hour countdown begins at 6:40 p.m. EST on February 17, with a simulated launch window opening at 8:30 p.m. on February 19. The rehearsal includes loading super-cold liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen into the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket, running a full countdown, practicing recycled countdown clocks, and draining tanks\u2014simulating scrub scenarios. Engineers replaced a filter in ground support equipment suspected of restricting liquid hydrogen flow during a partial fueling test on February 12, and enough data was collected to proceed with a full rehearsal. Although astronauts will not participate, ground teams will practice Orion spacecraft closeout procedures, including hatch operations. NASA has not set an official launch date, but March 6 is currently the earliest possible launch opportunity, contingent on a successful test, data review, and transition to launch operations. The rehearsal is one of the final major milestones before flight, designed to simulate real-world launch conditions and identify technical issues before crewed flight. NASA will provide live coverage, including a dedicated camera feed during fueling, and ongoing updates via its Artemis blog. According to NASA, the issue with the hydrogen flow was addressed by replacing the filter and reestablishing proper environmental conditions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 11:18 PM\nSource:[FOX 10](https://www.fox10phoenix.com/news/artemis-ii-nasa-targets-feb-19-second-moon-mission-fueling-rehearsal)\n\n**NASA's Latest Attempt to Resolve Moon Rocket's Fueling Problems Didn't Go As Planned**\nNASA's recent confidence test to validate repairs on the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket's fueling system encountered issues, casting doubt on its ability to resolve recurring hydrogen leaks ahead of the Artemis 2 launch window in March 2026. The test, conducted on the core stage's liquid hydrogen tank, was only partially successful due to a reduction in hydrogen flow caused by ground support equipment, specifically a suspected faulty filter. Engineers planned to purge the line and inspect the equipment before replacing the filter. The issue stems from a leak detected on February 3, 2026, during a wet dress rehearsal for Artemis 2, which occurred in a tail service mast umbilical on the mobile launcher. Two seals in the mast were replaced in response, but the confidence test did not fully confirm their effectiveness. This problem echoes challenges from the Artemis 1 mission in 2022, where similar leaks caused delays and a scrubbed launch. NASA had used the same loading procedure for Artemis 2 as for Artemis 1, but it failed to prevent the leak this time. NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman acknowledged the challenges, noting that the long gap between missions and prior issues should not be surprising, though he emphasized that safety remains the top priority. 'We will not launch unless we are ready and the safety of our astronauts will remain the highest priority,' Isaacman stated. The Artemis 2 mission is critical as the first crewed lunar mission since Apollo ended in 1972.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 09:00 PM\nSource:[Gizmodo](https://gizmodo.com/)\n\n**NASA's Artemis II to launch soon: The moon comeback we've waited 50 years for, explained**\nNASA's Artemis II mission, scheduled for launch no earlier than February 2026, marks humanity's first crewed deep space mission beyond low Earth orbit since Apollo 17 in 1972. The 10-day mission will send four astronauts\u2014Commander Reid Wiseman, Pilot Victor Glover (the first Black astronaut to fly to the Moon), Mission Specialist Christina Koch (the first woman to travel to lunar orbit), and Mission Specialist Jeremy Hansen (the first non-American to journey to the Moon)\u2014aboard the Orion spacecraft atop the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket. The mission will perform a lunar flyby using a free-return trajectory, traveling farther from Earth than any previous human mission, and will test critical systems including life-support, navigation, communication, radiation exposure, manual piloting, and re-entry. Unlike Artemis I, which was uncrewed, Artemis II is a high-stakes systems check to validate human capability in deep space before the planned Artemis III lunar landing in 2027. The mission will also conduct biomedical research, deploy CubeSats, capture high-resolution images of the Moon\u2019s far side, and test Orion\u2019s heat shield, which has been re-tuned based on data from Artemis I. Upon completion, Artemis II will serve as the prerequisite for future missions, including Artemis IV, V, and VI, which aim to build the Gateway space station and establish a sustainable lunar presence, with Mars as the ultimate long-term goal.

The Space Launch System (SLS) Block 1, the largest rocket ever built by NASA, successfully completed its rollout on January 17, 2026, after an eight-hour transport to the launch pad at Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral. This marks the final phase of preparations for Artemis II, which will carry four astronauts\u2014three Americans and one Canadian, including a woman\u2014on a 10-day journey beyond the Moon\u2019s orbit, reaching the farthest point ever visited by humans in a crewed mission. Unlike previous Apollo missions, Artemis II does not include a lunar landing module and will not land on the Moon; instead, it is focused on validating crewed flight systems. The first uncrewed test flight of Artemis occurred in 2022. The lunar landing is planned for Artemis III in 2027. The delay in returning to the Moon was due to the end of the Cold War, which removed the political urgency behind the Apollo program. Apollo was driven by geopolitical competition, not long-term exploration. After 1972, funding collapsed, public interest waned, and priorities shifted to cheaper, reusable projects like the Space Shuttle and the International Space Station. Today, the Artemis program is not about prestige but about permanence: establishing infrastructure, testing life-support systems, utilizing lunar resources, and creating a lunar outpost as a staging point for future Mars missions. International partners\u2014including China, India, Japan, Israel, and Europe\u2014and private companies like SpaceX are now key contributors, helping reduce costs and make sustained lunar exploration feasible. NASA aims for a permanent human presence on the Moon by 2030, just four years away.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 07:07 PM\nSource:[Jornal Op\u00e7\u00e3o](https://www.jornalopcao.com.br/ultimas-noticias/apos-mais-de-50-anos-artemis-ii-inicia-retorno-humano-em-fevereiro-786387/)\n\n**NASA targets Feb 6 for Artemis II mission**\nNASA has targeted February 6, 2026, for the launch of the Artemis II mission, marking the first crewed flight around the Moon since Apollo 17 in December 1972. The 10-day mission will carry four astronauts: NASA commander Reid Wiseman, pilot Victor Glover, mission specialist Christina Koch, and Canadian Space Agency (CSA) astronaut Jeremy Hansen. The Orion spacecraft and Space Launch System (SLS) rocket have been moved to the launch pad at Cape Canaveral, Florida, in preparation. NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman stated that Artemis II will send humans farther from Earth than ever before, providing critical data for future lunar landings and Mars missions. The mission will not land on the Moon but will conduct an initial Earth orbit to test life support and other vital systems. Artemis II will pave the way for Artemis III, scheduled for 2027, which aims to land humans on the lunar South Pole for the first time and establish a sustained presence. This mission is part of NASA\u2019s broader Artemis campaign, focused on scientific discovery, economic benefits, and preparing for future crewed missions to Mars. Artemis I, an uncrewed test flight, was successfully completed in August 2022.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 20, 2026 09:28 AM\nSource:[Ahmedabad Mirror](https://www.ahmedabadmirror.com/nasa-targets-feb-6-for-artemis-ii-mission/81906518.html)\n\n**NASA Moves Artemis II Rocket to Launch Pad: Countdown Begins for Return to the Moon**\nNASA has moved the Artemis II rocket, consisting of the Space Launch System (SLS) and the Orion spacecraft, to Launch Pad 39B at the Kennedy Space Center in Florida, marking a key step toward the return of humans to the Moon. The transport, conducted at a maximum speed of 1.32 km/h over a distance of more than six kilometers, was completed successfully. The agency will conduct a final dress rehearsal for the mission on February 2, 2026, involving fueling operations, countdown simulations, safe venting of cryogenic propellants, astronaut boarding, and hatch closure. If the test is successful, NASA will hold a flight readiness review to assess all systems, hardware, infrastructure, personnel, launch, and recovery capabilities before setting an official launch date. The Artemis II mission, scheduled to launch no earlier than February 6, 2026, aims to send four astronauts around the Moon to validate all systems ahead of Artemis III, planned for mid-2027. The launch window is subject to four key requirements: successful test completion, availability of essential supplies, favorable weather conditions, and coordination with other users in the Eastern Range. Should technical issues arise, the SLS and Orion could be returned to the Vehicle Assembly Building for additional work. According to NASA, three launch opportunities are currently under evaluation, though delays may occur due to supply chain issues, weather, or scheduling conflicts.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 19, 2026 07:44 AM\nSource:[20 minutos](https://www.20minutos.es/tecnologia/actualidad/nasa-mueve-cohete-artemis-ii-sitio-lanzamiento-comienza-cuenta-atras-para-volver-luna_6922729_0.html)\n\n**Lunar Missions, AI Scientists, and Early Cancer Detection: 2026\u2019s Top Science Events**\nAccording to Nature's '2026 Science Events to Watch', major space exploration initiatives are expected in 2026, led by global powers. NASA plans to launch the Artemis II mission in April 2026, sending four astronauts aboard the Orion spacecraft on a lunar orbit mission\u2014marking the first crewed lunar flyby in 50 years since Apollo 17. This follows the uncrewed Artemis I mission completed in late 2024. Success would pave the way for Artemis III, a crewed lunar landing planned for March 2027. China is set to launch the uncrewed Chang'e 7 mission to the Moon\u2019s south pole in August 2026. Japan plans to send a robotic probe to Mars\u2019 moons Phobos and Deimos to collect surface samples. The European Space Agency (ESA) will launch the next-generation exoplanet-hunting space telescope, Plato, by late 2026. On Earth, China will begin deep-sea drilling using its self-developed research vessel 'Mengxiang' to extract mantle samples from up to 11 km below the ocean floor in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, continuing a long-term exploration effort through 2035. This follows a 2023 IODP success that was limited by seawater exposure and funding constraints. In biomedicine, a large-scale clinical trial by Grail (U.S.) and the UK\u2019s NHS will assess the effectiveness of the 'Galleri' blood test, capable of detecting over 50 types of cancer before symptoms appear. The trial involves 140,000 participants, and if successful, FDA approval and clinical use are anticipated. Samsung Electronics and Samsung C&T invested 155 billion KRW in Grail in October 2025 to secure exclusive distribution rights in South Korea. Additionally, Nature predicts a rise in 'AI scientists'\u2014AI agents capable of autonomously conducting research by understanding user intent and executing tasks with minimal human input. South Korea plans to accelerate AI integration in science by developing 'AI research colleagues' and 'AI-specialized foundation models' in key fields like biotech and materials chemistry. However, Nature cautions that AI has already shown serious errors, such as deleting research data, underscoring the need for rigorous validation.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: December 25, 2025 10:15 AM\nSource:[\ud55c\uad6d\uc77c\ubcf4](https://www.hankookilbo.com/News/Read/A2025122513220000454)\n\n**NASA's Orion Spacecraft Stacked on SLS Rocket for Artemis II Mission**\nNASA's Orion spacecraft, named Integrity, was successfully stacked atop the Space Launch System (SLS) rocket on October 19, 2025, at the Kennedy Space Center\u2019s Vehicle Assembly Building in High Bay 3, marking a critical milestone for the Artemis II mission. Lockheed Martin, the prime contractor for Orion, confirmed the integration, noting the spacecraft is the most advanced and human-rated deep-space vehicle ever developed. The Artemis II mission, scheduled for launch no earlier than February 2026 with potential windows extending to April 2026, will carry four astronauts on a 10-day lunar flyby, making it the first crewed lunar mission in over 50 years. NASA Interim Administrator Sean Duffy stated that the SLS-Orion integration represents a major step forward in the Artemis program. Following integration, teams will establish electrical, data, and umbilical connections between Orion and SLS, and the assembled vehicle will be moved to Launch Complex 39B for a full dress rehearsal with propellant loading in the coming year. Lockheed Martin, a major aerospace and defense company with a market cap of \u20ac112 billion, reported strong Q3 2025 results: \u20ac6.95 EPS (exceeding the consensus of \u20ac6.36), \u20ac18.6 billion in revenue (slightly above the \u20ac18.5 billion forecast), and an operating margin of 12.3%, surpassing analyst projections. Bernstein SocGen Group maintained its 'Market Perform' rating with a \u20ac545 target, while Truist Securities reiterated its 'Hold' rating and \u20ac500 price target, citing strong earnings and cash flow. The company also announced a \u20ac10 million partnership with NioCorp Developments under Title III of the Defense Production Act to develop aluminum-scandium alloys for advanced military aircraft through Lockheed Martin\u2019s Skunk Works division. This collaboration supports U.S. defense innovation and supply chain resilience.

This milestone marks a critical step toward the Artemis 2 mission, which is scheduled for a launch window beginning February 5, 2026, and lasting until the end of April 2026. Artemis 2 will be the first crewed mission of the Artemis program, sending four astronauts\u2014Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, and Christina Koch from NASA, and Jeremy Hansen from the Canadian Space Agency\u2014on a 10-day journey around the Moon, including a flyby of the far side, before returning to Earth. The mission follows Artemis 1, an uncrewed test flight launched in November 2022. Despite progress, delays remain a recurring challenge: Artemis 1 and Artemis 2 are separated by over three years due to issues with Orion\u2019s heat shield during reentry. Furthermore, Artemis 3, originally planned for mid-2027, is now projected to launch in 2028, as NASA evaluates alternative options for the lunar lander, particularly due to concerns about SpaceX\u2019s Starship readiness. NASA Acting Administrator Sean Duffy confirmed the completion of the SLS-Orion integration on October 20, 2025, stating on social media: 'We are one step closer to completing the mission!'. The Artemis program aims to establish a sustainable human presence on the Moon and lay the groundwork for future Mars missions.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: October 21, 2025 04:26 PM\nSource:[MeteoWeb](https://www.meteoweb.eu/2025/10/luna-la-capsula-orion-installata-sul-razzo-sls-importante-traguardo-per-la-missione-artemis-2/1001851804/)\n\n**NASA is Looking to Launch Artemis II by February**\nNASA is preparing to launch the crewed Artemis II mission, the first crewed lunar flight since the Apollo era. The mission is targeted for no sooner than February 5, 2026, and no later than April 2026, and will carry a four\u2011person crew around the Moon without landing, returning them home ten days later. The Space Launch System (SLS) core and upper stage were stacked between March and May 2025, with the solid rocket boosters completed in February 2025; the Orion spacecraft is in final preparation and will be integrated with the SLS later this year. A wet\u2011dress rehearsal, where the launch system is fully fueled and a mock countdown is run, will precede the launch. Artemis II will evaluate all systems and architecture that will be used for Artemis III, scheduled for no earlier than mid\u20112027. Artemis III will involve a SpaceX\u2011provided Human Landing System (HLS) that will transfer two astronauts to lunar orbit and descend to the surface, for a mission lasting about 30 days and marking the first Moon walk since Apollo 17 in 1972.\n\nDuring a meeting on September 19, 2025, members of the Aerospace Safety Advisory Panel (ASAP) expressed doubt that the Starship HLS would be ready in time. Former NASA JSC Mission Operations Director Paul Hill said, 'The HLS schedule is significantly challenged and, in our estimation, could be years late for a 2027 Artemis 3 moon landing.' The panel also noted concerns about the cryogenic propellant transfer that SpaceX must demonstrate, but remained confident in SpaceX\u2019s manufacturing and flight tempo.\n\nNASA announced that the Artemis II crew had named their spacecraft \"Integrity\". A NASA statement explained, 'The name Integrity embodies the foundation of trust, respect, candor, and humility across the crew and the many engineers, technicians, scientists, planners, and dreamers required for mission success.' The statement also highlighted the effort of more than 300,000 spacecraft components and thousands of people worldwide. During the ASAP meeting, members described the future of NASA\u2019s lunar exploration plans beyond Artemis III as 'uncertain and a little murky.' Despite these concerns, NASA and the Artemis crew are on track to launch Artemis II next year, paving the way for a sustained program of lunar exploration and development.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 27, 2025 12:20 AM\nSource:[Universe Today](https://www.universetoday.com/articles/nasa-is-looking-to-launch-artemis-ii-by-february)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
