When the team attempted to pressurize the tank after troubleshooting the initial leak, another leak appeared quickly.\n\n2. **Orion Capsule Valve Problem:** A valve that pressurizes the vehicle required additional attention, and closing the hatch took longer than anticipated.\n\n3. **Additional Technical Issues:** Problems with cameras due to cold weather and audio dropouts across communication channels.\n\n## Named Source Quotes:\n\n- **Launch Director Charlie Blackwell-Thompson:** Described the leak issue during pressurization and characterized the day as \"a very successful day for us on many fronts\" while acknowledging \"we got some work we've got to go do.\"\n\n- **NASA Administrator Jared Isaacman:** Posted on X that \"safety remains our top priority, for our astronauts, our workforce, our systems and the public,\" and that NASA will only launch when ready.\n\n## Context:\n\n- Hydrogen leaks previously plagued testing of NASA's Artemis I mission in 2022\n- Lessons learned from the uncrewed Artemis I flight were utilized for Artemis II\n- NASA will require another wet dress rehearsal before authorizing astronauts to board\n- The crew was released from quarantine and will remain in Houston, re-entering quarantine 14 days before the next launch attempt\n- This would be the first crewed mission to the Moon in more than 50 years (since Apollo 17 in 1972)\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.nasa.gov/blogs/missions/2026/02/03/nasa-conducts-artemis-ii-fuel-test-eyes-march-for-launch-opportunity/\">\n# Summary of NASA Article on Artemis II Wet Dress Rehearsal (February 3, 2026)\n\n## Key Facts and Timeline Updates:\n\n**Test Completion and Results:**\n- NASA completed a wet dress rehearsal for Artemis II early Tuesday morning (Feb 2-3, 2026)\n- The test successfully loaded cryogenic propellant into the SLS tanks and safely drained the rocket\n- The approximately 49-hour countdown began at 8:13 p.m. EST on January 31\n\n**Launch Window Change:**\n- **NASA now targets March 2026 as the earliest possible launch opportunity** (moved from February 2026)\n- This delay is to allow teams to review data and conduct a second wet dress rehearsal\n- No official target launch date has been set yet\n\n**Technical Issues Encountered:**\n\n1. **Liquid hydrogen leak:** Engineers spent several hours troubleshooting a leak in an interface routing propellant into the rocket's core stage. The ground launch sequencer automatically stopped the countdown at approximately 5 minutes due to a spike in the leak rate.\n\n2. **Cold weather impacts:** Cold temperatures at Kennedy Space Center caused a late start to tanking operations and affected several cameras and other equipment.\n\n3. **Valve issue:** A valve associated with Orion crew module hatch pressurization (recently replaced) required retorquing.\n\n4. **Communication dropouts:** Audio communication channel dropouts across ground teams have been occurring in recent weeks and reoccurred during the test.\n\n5. **Closeout operations:** Took longer than planned.\n\n**Crew Status:**\n- The four astronauts (Reid Wiseman, Victor Glover, Christina Koch, and Jeremy Hansen) entered quarantine in Houston on January 21\n- They will be released from quarantine due to the launch delay\n- They will not travel to Kennedy Space Center on Tuesday as tentatively planned\n- Crew will re-enter quarantine about two weeks before the next targeted launch opportunity\n\n**NASA's Position:**\n- Engineers met many of the planned objectives despite challenges\n- Crew safety remains the highest priority\n- Teams will fully review data, mitigate each issue, and return to testing before setting an official target launch date\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Metaculus community prediction history for \u201cWill NASA's Artemis II complete its mission successfully before 2027?\u201d February 2025-2026; include datapoints around 80 % threshold\nMetaculus question #40864 (\u201cWill NASA's Artemis II complete its mission successfully before 2027?\u201d) is the \u201ctarget question\u201d whose community-prediction trajectory from February 2025 through February 2026 must be reconstructed in order to judge how often, and for how long, the forecast has sat above or below the critical 80 % line.\n\nWhat the available sources tell us\n\n1. Current reference point  \n   \u2022 The community prediction stood at 80.00 % on 2026-02-16, i.e., 11 days before the evaluation date of 2026-02-27 (question statement, context block).  \n   \u2022 No other dated community-prediction figures are given in any of the retrieved documents.\n\n2. External schedule information likely to influence forecasts  \n   \u2022 NASA\u2019s public schedule slips and accelerations provide objective \u201cnews shocks\u201d that forecasters typically react to:\n     \u2013 22 Mar 2025: NASA announced an acceleration of the launch target from April 2026 to February 2026 (question background).  \n     \u2013 23 Sep 2025: senior officials confirmed a launch window opening 5 Feb 2026 (Ars Technica, 23 Sep 2025).  \n     \u2013 26 Sep 2025: NASA repeated the \u201cno earlier than 5 Feb 2026\u201d goal and \u201cno later than April 2026\u201d limit (Universe Today, 26 Sep 2025).  \n   \u2022 These milestones fall squarely inside the February-2025 \u2192 February-2026 interval of interest, making them useful anchor dates for reading forecast movements once the numerical history is obtained.\n\n3. Indirect evidence that the forecast has exceeded 80 % at least once before 2026-02-16  \n   \u2022 A Manifold Markets mirror of the Metaculus question cites a \u201ccurrent 89 %\u201d community estimate, with reasoning that a further slip past 2026 is the main downside risk (Manifold, undated but clearly sometime after March 2025 because it discusses the 2026 launch window).  \n   \u2022 While Manifold is a separate platform, its creator explicitly states that the market \u201cresolves according to Metaculus resolution,\u201d and Manifold questions of this type are seeded by scraping the live Metaculus community percentage. Hence the 89 % figure is strong circumstantial evidence that Metaculus itself was near 89 % on that day.  \n   \u2022 Because the cited Manifold commentary mentions the stacked SLS-Orion vehicle and a completed wet-dress rehearsal, it must post-date the September 2025 NASA briefings. Therefore the Metaculus prediction almost certainly crossed well above 80 % in the second half of 2025.\n\n4. Availability of a primary data source  \n   \u2022 Several developer guides and wrappers (e.g., the Ergo-Ought Python wrapper and the NYC-Servers API walkthrough referenced in prior analysis) confirm that Metaculus exposes a /questions/{id}/prediction_timeseries endpoint requiring authentication. That endpoint is the authoritative source for every community-prediction datapoint, including timestamps and percent values, and is therefore necessary for a rigorous reconstruction.\n\nLimitations of the current evidence base\n\n\u2022 None of the search results supplies the actual prediction_timeseries JSON, nor even a screenshot of the Metaculus chart.  \n\u2022 We still lack specific daily or weekly percentage values between 1 Feb 2025 and 27 Feb 2026.  \n\u2022 Consequently, we cannot yet draw the detailed time-series graph, identify the exact date of the first breach of the 80 % level, or quantify dwell time above/below that threshold.  \n\u2022 No documentation surfaced that Metaculus changed its weighting or aggregation methodology during the period, but this absence of evidence is not confirmation. Verification inside the API payload\u2019s metadata (or the question\u2019s change log) is still needed.\n\nSynthesis relative to the downstream forecasting problem\n\nThe downstream yes/no forecast hinges on whether the community prediction on 2026-02-27 is greater than 80.00 %. The single observation we possess (80.00 % on 2026-02-16) shows the forecast perched exactly on the knife-edge 11 days beforehand. Indirect corroboration (Manifold\u2019s 89 %) indicates that the community has been comfortable at levels materially above 80 % in the recent past. However, without the complete timeline we cannot evaluate:\n\n\u2022 The variance of the series\u2014does it oscillate in a 70\u201390 % band or plateau close to 80 %?  \n\u2022 The persistence of shocks\u2014do schedule updates move the needle for days, weeks, or hours?  \n\u2022 The frequency and duration of sub-80 % dips, which would be essential for assigning probabilities to a renewed decline before 27 Feb 2026.\n\nIn short, the qualitative evidence suggests that 80 % is neither a hard ceiling nor a stable long-term mean; rather, the community prediction has probably spent considerable time above that mark. Nevertheless, quantitative confirmation is still missing.\n\nInformation still needed to fully satisfy the original query\n\n1. Complete prediction_timeseries data for question #40864 covering at least 01 Feb 2025 \u2192 16 Feb 2026, ideally through 27 Feb 2026 once available.  \n2.
