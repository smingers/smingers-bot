**Other sources**: Various FRED pages and glossary definitions provide context but limited predictive value.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Recent 8-day periods (similar to forecast horizon)**
- From 2026-02-10 to 2026-02-16: moved from 2.61% to 2.68% (+0.07%)
- Typical daily volatility appears low in current environment
- Suitability: High - most relevant for short-term forecast

**Reference Class 2: Monthly-end rebalancing periods**
- Index rebalances on last calendar day of month
- Target date (2026-02-26) is 5 days before month-end
- Could see positioning flows ahead of rebalancing
- Suitability: Moderate - relevant but not deterministic

**Reference Class 3: Historical 1-year distribution (2025-2026)**
- Mean: 2.97%, Min: 2.56%, Max: 4.29%, Range: 1.73%
- Current level (2.68%) near the lower end of recent range
- Suitability: High - captures recent market regime

**Reference Class 4: Full historical distribution (since 1997)**
- Mean: 5.71%, current level represents extreme compression
- All-time low: 1.78%
- Suitability: Low - includes multiple different market regimes

**Selected Reference Class**: Combination of recent 1-year distribution and 8-day short-term dynamics, given the 8-day forecast horizon.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Forecast Horizon**: 8 calendar days (2026-02-18 to 2026-02-26), likely 6 trading days

**Historical Patterns Over Similar Periods**:
- Recent 8-day period (Feb 10-16): +0.07% change
- Standard deviation over 2024-2026: 0.46% annually ≈ 0.03% per 8 days (assuming √(8/252) scaling)
- Recent daily changes: mostly 0.01-0.09% moves
- Largest recent single-day move: +0.07% (Feb 12-13)

**Seasonal/Calendar Factors**:
- No major scheduled economic releases or ECB meetings in this 8-day window
- Month-end rebalancing on Feb 28 is after the forecast date
- Mid-February typically sees moderate trading activity

## (d) Justification

The spread currently sits at 2.68% (as of Feb 16), in the bottom quintile of post-GFC range and near 1-year lows. Several factors support stability over the 8-day horizon:

1. **Short timeframe limits volatility**: With only 6 trading days, absent a major shock, spreads typically move <0.15% based on recent patterns.

2. **Current market regime**: Agent report notes "benign soft-landing scenario" with ECB maintaining stable policy, low default expectations, and strong technical demand. Fund managers are positioned cautiously but not defensively.

3. **Mean reversion vs. momentum**: At 2.68%, spreads are 0.29% below the 1-year mean (2.97%) but have been trending tighter. The 3-month change shows -0.30% compression. Very short forecast horizon limits mean reversion potential.

4. **Risk factors**: ECB bulletin notes rising trade tensions and tight valuations. Any negative surprise could quickly add 50-100bp, but probability of such shock in 8 days is low. Conversely, further compression toward all-time low (1.78%) is possible but would require sustained positive news.

5. **Statistical baseline**: Recent standard deviation suggests 68% confidence interval of ±0.03% around current level for 8-day period, implying 2.65-2.71% range for 1-sigma moves.

Given the short horizon, I expect the distribution to be centered near the current 2.68% level with modest dispersion. The 10th-90th percentile range should capture roughly 1.5-2 standard deviations of potential 8-day moves, accounting for both continuation of recent tightening trend and possibility of modest widening.

## Outside View Calibration

**Anchoring considerations**:
- Current value: 2.68%
- Recent range (Feb 1-16): 2.58-2.69%
- 1-year range: 2.56-4.29%
- Question bounds: 2.1845-4.68372% (open bounds)

**Distribution shape**: Given short timeframe and current tight levels, distribution should be:
- Slightly right-skewed (more upside risk from widening than downside from further compression near historical lows)
- Centered close to current 2.68% level
- 80% confidence interval (10th-90th) approximately 2.50-2.95%

**Tail considerations**:
- 10th percentile: Allow for continued tightening trend, approaching but not quite reaching all-time low (1.78%). Set at 2.52%.
- 90th percentile: Allow for modest risk-off move or negative surprise. Recent volatility suggests +0.25-0.30% is plausible upper bound for 8 days. Set at 2.94%.

**Calibration checks**:
- Median (50th percentile) near 2.68-2.70%: Reflects status quo with slight upward bias
- Interquartile range (20th-80th): ~0.15-0.20%, consistent with recent daily volatility scaled to 8 days
- Tails extend beyond recent 2-week range but stay within 1-year observed range
