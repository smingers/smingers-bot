Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**FRED Data (2026-02-16):** Primary data source showing the most recent value of 2.68% as of Feb 16, 2026. This is the authoritative source for historical values. The data shows recent stability around 2.60-2.69% in February 2026, with a slight uptick from 2.58% on Feb 3 to current levels.

**Agent Report (Comprehensive):** High-quality synthesis covering Jan 2024 to Feb 2026. Key factual findings: 543-day mean of 3.17%, standard deviation of 0.46%, current value at historical lows (bottom quintile post-GFC). Documents specific catalysts including ECB policy, geopolitical risk premia, technical supply/demand factors. The report correctly identifies that spreads are "stretched" by historical standards at 2.6-2.7%.

**Morningstar Article (Feb 16, 2026):** Recent and relevant. Reports EUR 1.92 billion inflows to euro corporate bond funds in January 2026, seventh consecutive year of positive flows. Multiple fund managers quoted expressing caution about tight spreads but noting solid fundamentals. Factual data: eurozone corporate bonds up 1.2% YTD 2026, 3.2% over past 12 months.

**ECB Economic Bulletin (Issue 3, 2025):** Authoritative source on European monetary policy and financial conditions. Key facts: inflation at 2.2% (March 2025), unemployment at 6.1% (lowest since euro launch), corporate borrowing costs declining (4.1% for new loans, 3.5% for market debt). Notes corporate bond spreads have widened globally amid trade tensions but provides context for the overall environment.

**White & Case Insights (Feb 3, 2026):** General M&A market commentary without specific credit spread data. Limited relevance to forecasting question.

**Other Sources:** Various FRED pages and glossaries provide definitional context but no predictive value.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Recent 10-day movements (Feb 2026)**
- Range: 2.58% to 2.69% (11 bp range)
- Suitability: High - captures current market regime and volatility
- Pattern: Relatively stable with small daily fluctuations

**Reference Class 2: 1-month historical volatility**
- Recent 1-month change: +0.10% (+3.9%)
- Suitability: Moderate - shows typical monthly variation
- Pattern: Modest directional moves possible

**Reference Class 3: Historical standard deviation (2024-2026)**
- σ = 0.46% over 543 days
- Suitability: High - captures full cycle including stress episodes
- Pattern: Occasional spikes (e.g., April 2025 tariff shock) but general compression trend

**Reference Class 4: Post-2021 range**
- Current level (2.68%) near historical lows since 2021
- All-time low: 1.78%
- Suitability: Moderate - provides bounds but different macro regime

**Selected Reference Class:** Combination of recent 10-day movements (primary) with 1-month volatility and historical σ as bounds. This balances the short 8-day forecast horizon with awareness of tail risks.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 8 calendar days (Feb 18 to Feb 26, 2026), approximately 6 trading days.

**Historical Patterns Over Similar Periods:**
- Recent 6-trading-day ranges: typically 5-11 basis points
- Feb 3-10 (6 trading days): 2.58% to 2.61% (3 bp range)
- Feb 10-16 (4 trading days): 2.61% to 2.69% (8 bp range)
- Standard daily change: approximately σ_daily ≈ 0.46%/√252 ≈ 0.03% (3 bp)

**Key Observations:**
1. No major scheduled events (ECB meeting, major data releases) between Feb 18-26 based on sources
2. Month-end rebalancing occurs Feb 28 (after forecast window)
3. Current level (2.68%) represents continuation of tight-spread regime
4. Market already pricing benign scenario per multiple sources

## (d) Justification

The 8-day forecast window is very short, limiting the scope for major regime changes. The current value of 2.68% (as of Feb 16) serves as the natural anchor, with the Feb 18 opening likely very close to this level.

**Factors supporting stability/modest changes:**
- No major catalysts identified in the 8-day window
- Strong technical support from continued fund inflows (EUR 1.92B in Jan 2026)
- ECB maintaining accommodative stance with stable rate expectations
- Fund managers positioned defensively but not expecting imminent widening
- Recent daily volatility contained (2.58-2.69% range in Feb)

**Factors supporting potential widening:**
- Spreads at historical lows (2.68% vs. long-term average 5.71%)
- Multiple sources note "tight" or "stretched" valuations
- High vulnerability to any negative surprise given compressed starting point
- Historical σ of 0.46% suggests 1-standard-deviation monthly moves of ~46 bp are possible
- Geopolitical and trade policy risks remain (per ECB)

**Factors supporting potential tightening:**
- Momentum of spread compression from H2-2025
- Strong demand technicals
- Low default expectations in higher-quality BB-dominated index
- Potential for continued risk-on sentiment

**Quantitative Framework:**
- Base case: 2.68% ± 5-10 bp (one standard weekly move)
- Central 80% range: approximately 2.50% to 2.85%
- Tail scenarios: Downside to 2.35-2.40% (continued compression toward all-time low of 1.78%), upside to 3.00-3.20% (modest risk-off episode)

Given the short timeframe, mean reversion is limited. The distribution should be centered near 2.68% with modest positive skew (easier to widen from historically tight levels than to compress further).

## Outside View Calibration

**Anchoring Considerations:**
- Starting point: 2.68% (Feb 16 close)
- Expected Feb 18 opening: 2.66-2.70% (accounting for weekend)
- 6-trading-day typical range: 5-11 bp

**Distribution Shape:**
- Slightly right-skewed (positive) due to asymmetric risk at historically tight levels
- Mode near current value with fat tails to capture low-probability stress scenarios
- Historical upset rate in credit markets: ~10-15% of periods see moves >1.5σ

**Percentile Calibration:**
- 10th percentile: Should capture scenario of continued compression, potentially testing 2.50% area
- Median (50th): Close to current level, slight upward bias given positioning
- 90th percentile: Should capture modest risk-off scenario without full crisis, around 2.95-3.00%

**Bounds Check:**
- Lower bound given: 2.1845% (open)
- Upper bound given: 4.68372% (open)
- My distribution should respect these as possible but assign low probability to extremes
- 10th percentile well above lower bound reflects low probability of 50+ bp compression in 8 days
- 90th percentile well below upper bound reflects low probability of major crisis in 8 days

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 2.52
Percentile 20: 2.58
Percentile 40: 2.65
Percentile 60: 2.72
Percentile 80: 2.82
Percentile 90: 2.95
