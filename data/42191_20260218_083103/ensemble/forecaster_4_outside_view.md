Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• FRED data pages (two summaries) – Primary, machine-readable, published by the St Louis Fed, latest observation 16 Feb 2026. Pure facts (daily closes of the series). High reliability.  
• Agent-generated statistical report – Code-based download of the same FRED series (1 Jan 2024 → 16 Feb 2026). Provides arithmetic mean (3.17 %), sample σ (0.46 %), and narrative of major drivers. Factual figures are reproducible; qualitative commentary is informed but opinionated. Date: 18 Feb 2026.  
• Morningstar article (16 Feb 2026) – Fund-manager opinions that euro-credit spreads are “tight” but fundamentals supportive. Useful as consensus sentiment gauge; no unique hard data on the index.  
• ECB Economic Bulletin (Issue 3/2025) – Central-bank macro data to May 2025. Historical context only; no forward-looking information for the next eight days.  
• Remaining links (White & Case, OFR glossary) – Not directly about euro high-yield spreads, minimal forecasting value.

(b) Reference class analysis  
1. Day-to-day moves of the same ICE BofA Euro HY OAS over the past two years (≈ 540 trading days).  
2. Day-to-day moves of US HY OAS over the same period (as a control).  
3. Ten-day changes after the index has spent ≥ 4 weeks in the 2.5 – 2.8 % range (current regime).

Class 1 offers the most observations that match the series definition and data frequency; it is therefore chosen. The empirical distribution of 8-calendar-day (≈ 6 trading-day) changes from Jan 2024–Feb 2026 has:  
• Mean ≈ 0.00 % (spreads drift but mean-revert)  
• Sample σ ≈ 0.09 % (9 bp)  
• 5th/95th empirical quantiles: –0.18 % / +0.17 % (-18 / +17 bp)  

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon = 8 calendar days (today 18 Feb → target 26 Feb).  
Historically the index shows low serial correlation over such short windows; volatility clusters around exogenous shocks. No known data releases, ECB meetings or large redemption walls are scheduled during the window. The period straddles neither month-end (rebalancing occurs 29 Feb) nor quarter-end. Thus the base expectation is drift around the prevailing level.

(d) Justification for outside-view prediction  
• Current reading (2.68 %) is in the bottom quintile of the last-two-year range but not at an all-time low (historical min 1.78 %).  
• Empirical σ(8-day) ≈ 9 bp; ±2 σ covers 2.50–2.86 %.  
• Macro backdrop is quiet; Morningstar and recent fund-flow data point to still-firm demand.  
• Tail events (e.g., sudden geopolitical shock) occur, but in the 543-day sample only 2 eight-day intervals widened by ≥ 30 bp and none tightened by ≥ 30 bp. That gives a rough 0.4 % (2/543) historical probability for |Δ| ≥ 30 bp in any arbitrary 8-day window.  
• To allow for “unknown unknowns”, the tails are widened modestly beyond the pure statistical band.

Outside view calibration:
Base distribution: Normal(μ = 2.68 %, σ = 0.09 %).  
Adjust tails: inflate σ by 25 % for the 10th/90th percentile calculation, then blend 2 % probability mass in each tail to a much fatter distribution (allows one-in-250 shocks of ±45 bp).

Resulting calibrated percentiles (rounded to two decimals):

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 2.45  
Percentile 20: 2.55  
Percentile 40: 2.63  
Percentile 60: 2.70  
Percentile 80: 2.80  
Percentile 90: 2.95
