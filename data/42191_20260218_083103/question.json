    "description": "The Federal Reserve Economic Data database (FRED) provides economic data from national, international, public, and private sources. The series BAMLHE00EHYIOAS is a dataset that is tracked by the FRED API. It represents the option-adjusted spread of the ICE BofA Euro High Yield Index, which tracks the performance of below investment grade corporate debt issued in the euro domestic or eurobond markets. The title of the series is \"ICE BofA Euro High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread\". The last data point on the graph (as of creation of this question) is from 2026-02-12 and has a value of 2.62. The units of the series are \"Percent\". The update frequency of the series is \"Daily\". The seasonal adjustment of the series is \"Not Seasonally Adjusted\". An interactive graph for the series can be found [here](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLHE00EHYIOAS). Below are the notes attached to the series:\n\n> This data represents the Option-Adjusted Spread (OAS) of the ICE BofA Euro High Yield Index tracks the performance of Euro denominated below investment grade corporate debt publicly issued in the euro domestic or eurobond markets. Qualifying securities must have a below investment grade rating (based on an average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch). Qualifying securities must have at least one year remaining term to maturity, a fixed coupon schedule, and a minimum amount outstanding of Euro 100 million. Original issue zero coupon bonds, \"global\" securities (debt issued simultaneously in the eurobond and euro domestic markets), 144a securities and pay-in-kind securities, including toggle notes, qualify for inclusion in the Index. Callable perpetual securities qualify provided they are at least one year from the first call date. Fixed-to-floating rate securities also qualify provided they are callable within the fixed rate period and are at least one year from the last call prior to the date the bond transitions from a fixed to a floating rate security. Defaulted, warrant-bearing and euro legacy currency securities are excluded from the Index.\n> \n> ICE BofA Explains the Construction Methodology of this series as:\n> Index constituents are capitalization-weighted based on their current amount outstanding. With the exception of U.S. mortgage pass-throughs and U.S. structured products (ABS, CMBS and CMOs), accrued interest is calculated assuming next-day settlement. Accrued interest for U.S. mortgage pass-through and U.S. structured products is calculated assuming same-day settlement. Cash flows from bond payments that are received during the month are retained in the index until\n> the end of the month and then are removed as part of the rebalancing. Cash does not earn any reinvestment income while it is held in the Index. The Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of the month, based on information available up to and including the third business day before the last business day of the month. Issues that meet the qualifying criteria are included in the Index for the following month. Issues that no longer meet the criteria during the course of the month remain in the Index until the next month-end rebalancing at which point they are removed from the Index.\n> \n> The ICE BofA OASs are the calculated spreads between a computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve. An OAS index is constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization. When the last calendar day of the month takes place on the weekend, weekend observations will occur as a result of month ending accrued interest adjustments.\n> \n> Certain indices and index data included in FRED are the property of ICE Data Indices, LLC (\u201cICE DATA\u201d) and used under license.
