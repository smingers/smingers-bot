Analysis:
To estimate where the ICE BofA Euro High Yield Index OAS will print on 26 Feb 2026 I need up-to-the-minute information on:  
• How euro-denominated high-yield credit spreads have behaved since early February 2026 (are they tightening or widening?).  
• Market commentary on the drivers of those moves—ECB policy expectations, recession odds, default forecasts, geopolitical shocks, flows into/out of HY funds, etc.  
• Any forthcoming events before 26 Feb that could jolt spreads (ECB minutes, major macro data, large HY issuers’ earnings).  
Therefore the most relevant news will be very recent pieces (mid-Feb 2026) from financial outlets that explicitly mention “Euro high-yield”, “credit spread”, “ICE BofA”, or “OAS”.  Broader credit-market round-ups and ECB policy stories are also helpful. The queries below are aimed at surfacing exactly those articles and discussions.
