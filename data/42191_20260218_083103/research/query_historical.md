Analysis:
To project the 2026-02-26 value, the key context I need is:  
• Recent path of the ICE BofA Euro High Yield OAS (level, 1-month / 1-year volatility, reaction to macro shocks).  
• Macro or market news over the last few weeks that might move euro-denominated high-yield spreads (ECB policy expectations, recession fears, geopolitical events, default headlines).  
Historical data from FRED will give the statistical backdrop; broader web and news searches will surface any current narrative or catalyst likely to shift the spread in the next eight days.
