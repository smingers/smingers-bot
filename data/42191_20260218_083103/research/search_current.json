Nineteen percent of respondents expect gold to rise above $7,000, while 20 percent believe it has already reached its peak. The 'long gold' position\u2014investments made in anticipation of rising gold prices\u2014was the most crowded trade for the second consecutive month, with 50 percent of participants holding this view. Gold's strong appeal is reflected in portfolio allocations: net overweight in equities reached 48 percent, the highest level since December 2024, while net underweight in bonds fell to 40 percent, the lowest since September 2022. Investors expect long-term bond yields to rise (57 percent) and short-term yields to fall (46 percent). The combined weight of equities and commodities reached a net 76 percent, the highest since January 2022. Investors increased exposure to emerging markets (net +49 percent) and Eurozone equities (net +35 percent), while reducing exposure to U.S. equities (net -22 percent). Demand for energy, basic materials, and consumer staples rose in February, while outflows were observed from U.S. equities, technology, and dollar-denominated assets. Risk indicators are also notable: the BofA Bull & Bear Indicator rose to 9.5, entering the 'sell' zone, signaling a reversal. Twenty-five percent of respondents identified the 'AI bubble' as their top tail risk, while 43 percent cited private equity and private credit markets as potential sources of a systemic credit crisis. The survey reflects a dual investor stance: increasing allocation to gold and riskier assets, while maintaining caution toward potential bubbles and credit risks. The $6,200 average peak forecast and the $7,000 scenario remain central to market expectations.\nOriginal language: tr\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 01:26 PM\nSource:[S\u00f6zc\u00fc Gazetesi](https://www.sozcu.com.tr/abd-li-bankadan-carpici-anket-altin-icin-dengeleri-altust-edecek-tahmin-p294773)\n\n**Capex overinvestment concerns hit new high, BofA survey finds By Investing.com**\nAccording to Bank of America's February 2026 global fund manager survey (FMS), concerns about companies overinvesting in capital expenditure (capex) have reached a record high, with 35% of chief investment officers stating that firms should prioritize improving balance sheets\u2014up from 26% previously\u2014while only 20% now favor increasing capex, down from 34%. The survey, conducted from February 6 to 12 among 190 panellists managing $512 billion in assets, reveals the most bullish investor sentiment since mid-2021, with the composite sentiment gauge at 8.2. Net 52% of investors expect a 'no landing' scenario for the global economy, a record high, and 36% anticipate a 'boom,' the highest since February 2022. Net 39% foresee stronger global economic growth over the next 12 months, with global expectations turning positive in November 2025. Despite improving growth outlooks, 42% still describe the economic outlook as 'stagflation,' reflecting persistent inflation concerns. Net 24% expect double-digit earnings growth in the next year, the strongest reading since August 2021. On asset allocation, net 48% are overweight equities (highest since December 2024), and net 40% are underweight bonds (largest underweight since September 2022). Net 57% expect higher long-term bond yields (highest since February 2022), and net 46% expect lower short-term rates. Equity positioning shows net 49% overweight emerging market equities (highest since February 2021), 35% overweight Eurozone equities, and net 22% underweight U.S. equities. A rotation toward Energy, Materials, and Staples occurred, while reducing exposure to U.S. equities, Tech, and the U.S. dollar. The BofA Bull & Bear Indicator rose to 9.5, triggering a contrarian 'sell signal.' The biggest tail risk cited is an 'AI bubble' (25%), followed by private equity and private credit as the most likely source of a systemic credit event (43%). 'Long gold' remains the most crowded trade for a second consecutive month, cited by 50% of respondents. On policy, 38% believe Kevin Warsh\u2019s nomination as Fed chair would raise U.S. Treasury yields and weaken the U.S. dollar. In politics, 62% expect a Democratic House and Republican Senate in the 2026 U.S. midterms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 11:38 AM\nSource:[Investing.com South Africa](https://za.investing.com/news/stock-market-news/capex-overinvestment-concerns-hit-new-high-bofa-survey-finds-4116727)\n\n**Crestwood Advisors Group LLC Purchases 81,924 Shares of iShares Broad USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF $USIG**\nCrestwood Advisors Group LLC increased its stake in iShares Broad USD Investment Grade Corporate Bond ETF (NASDAQ: USIG) by 18.0% in the third quarter of 2025, acquiring an additional 81,924 shares, bringing its total ownership to 537,199 shares, valued at $28,053,000, or 0.18% of the fund.

The ICE BofA Corporate Option-Adjusted Spread, a key indicator of credit market stress, remains compressed despite elevated US debt ($38.5 trillion as of January) and a 10-year Treasury yield of 4.28%, suggesting that risk is underpriced. Historically, Bitcoin has formed local bottoms three to six months after credit spreads begin to widen, as seen in 2018, 2020, and 2022. Analyst Joao Wedson of Alphractal predicted in August 2025 that a tightening of liquidity and rising credit spreads could trigger a new Bitcoin accumulation phase. Recent data shows increased short-term selling: large holders (whales) and mid-term holders moved approximately 5,000 BTC to Binance, mirroring a similar spike in December. The spent output profit ratio (SOPR), a metric tracking seller behavior, dropped to 1\u2014the lowest level in a year\u2014indicating long-term seller exhaustion. With Treasury yields expected to pressure credit markets and spreads potentially rising to 1.5\u20132% by April 2026, an accumulation window may emerge between May and July 2026, aligning with historical patterns.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 03, 2026 09:24 PM\nSource:[Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/next-bitcoin-accumulation-phase-may-hinge-on-credit-stress-timing-data)\n\n**Auour Investments LLC Acquires 47,862 Shares of SPDR Portfolio High Yield Bond ETF $SPHY**\nAuour Investments LLC increased its stake in SPDR Portfolio High Yield Bond ETF (NYSEARCA:SPHY) by 207.7% in the third quarter of 2025, acquiring an additional 47,862 shares, bringing its total ownership to 70,906 shares, valued at $1,697,000 as of its most recent SEC filing.

Despite rising investor interest due to declining investment-grade bond yields\u2014down from over 4.1% to below 2.75% for Canadian 5-year bonds and similarly reduced US Treasury yields\u2014junk bonds are not providing sufficient yield premium relative to their elevated credit risk. The ICE BofA US High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread, a key measure of excess return over risk-free Treasuries, indicates a minimal yield advantage. At present, the spread is not compelling, suggesting that investors are not being adequately rewarded for the added risk. The current US speculative-grade bond default rate is 4.6%, elevated compared to 2022\u2019s sub-2% lows, though below historic peaks during the financial crisis (over 12%) and Covid (nearly 7%). Rowat cautions that weak economic data in 2026 could further erode the perceived value of junk bonds, as recessions typically increase default rates. He compares investing in junk bonds to placing a parlay bet\u2014tempting due to high yields but unjustified by the underlying risk. Alternative strategies for improving portfolio yield include equity exposure (e.g., S&P/TSX Composite, FTSE 100) and preferred shares, which offer higher yields with lower default risk due to stable, blue-chip issuers. Rowat concludes that, at this time, the junk bond market resembles a 'bad parlay bet' where the reward does not justify the risk.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 06, 2025 01:23 PM\nSource:[greaterfool.ca](https://www.greaterfool.ca/2025/12/06/got-junk/)\n\n**US corporate credit spreads widen as equities market falls By Reuters**\nU.S. corporate credit spreads widened on November 18, 2025, as the stock market closed below the 50-day moving average for the S&P 500 and Nasdaq for the first time since April 30, 2025. According to the ICE BofA U.S. High Yield Index, the average option-adjusted spread on U.S. high-yield corporate credit widened by six basis points from Friday to Monday. Investment-grade corporate credit spreads also increased, rising from 83 bps to 84 bps on the ICE BofA U.S. Corporate Index. The move followed a broader decline in global equities, driven by investor concerns over a weakening U.S. economy and a potential artificial intelligence (AI) market bubble. A portfolio manager for high-yield corporate bonds, speaking anonymously, noted that while the theme of economic fragility is gaining attention, 'I don't see it blowing up in the high-yield or even investment-grade bond market - it's never going to be big enough to cause pain for people.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 18, 2025 04:07 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/economy-news/us-corporate-credit-spreads-widen-as-equities-market-falls-4365678)\n\n**Macquarie High Income Fund Q3 2025 Commentary (Mutual Fund:IVHIX)**\nIn the third quarter of 2025 (3Q25), US high yield bonds, as measured by the ICE BofA US Cash Pay High Yield Index, returned +2.40%.

A break above 4.15% would signal renewed upward pressure on yields, especially given the recent decline since mid-July. The U.S. Dollar Index is showing bullish divergence on the RSI, with a potential double-bottom pattern forming, but confirmation requires a move above 99. The USD/JPY may weaken initially post-Japan elections, as newly probable PM Sanae Takaichi is seen as a fiscal dove and a prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of Shinzo Abe, potentially limiting yen strength despite narrowing U.S.-Japan spread. Credit spreads are beginning to widen, particularly in Italy and Germany, with Italian 10-year yields showing a possible inverse head and shoulders pattern, while U.S. high-yield spreads (ICE BofA Option-Adjusted Spread) are rising\u2014suggesting market concerns over a weakening labor market. This credit deterioration may already be reflected in the stock declines of Blackstone (NYSE:BX), Apollo (NYSE:APO), and Meta (NASDAQ:META), signaling that investors are pricing in a future credit downturn, even as AI-driven spending continues. Despite this, stock prices have not yet fully reacted to widening spreads.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 07:12 AM\nSource:[Investing.com India](https://in.investing.com/analysis/stocks-week-ahead-credit-markets-private-equity-bets-flash-warning-signs-200631460)\n\n**Stocks Week Ahead: Credit Markets, Private Equity Bets Flash Warning Signs | Investing.com**\nThe week ahead in financial markets is expected to be light on economic data due to the ongoing U.S. government shutdown, but Treasury auctions for 3-year, 10-year, and 30-year bonds will proceed. The 10-year Treasury yield, which has been declining since mid-July, may reverse its trend if it breaks above 4.15%, signaling renewed upward pressure. Weak demand in Treasury auctions could confirm this shift. The U.S. Dollar Index shows a bullish divergence on the RSI, suggesting a potential double bottom, though a breakout above 99 is needed to confirm a stronger bullish outlook. The USD/JPY may weaken as Japan\u2019s likely new Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi\u2014seen as a fiscal dove and protege of Shinzo Abe\u2014may lead to lower yen strength despite narrowing U.S.-Japan yield spreads. Meanwhile, Italian and German credit spreads have begun to widen slightly, breaking from historically tight levels, which could signal broader global spread increases. While French and German yields are rising, Italian 10-year yields have remained flat, though a potential inverse head and shoulders pattern suggests they may rise soon. In the U.S., the ICE BofA High Yield Option-Adjusted Spread is increasing, possibly reflecting early market concerns about a weakening labor market. Credit spreads are critical because they directly influence stock valuations; even modest widening has not yet impacted stock prices. The recent declines in stocks like Blackstone (NYSE:BX) and Apollo (NYSE:APO) may reflect early market pricing of deteriorating credit quality. This could suggest that excessive AI spending may eventually lead to financial strain, particularly for high-spending firms\u2014though Meta (NASDAQ:META) remains a variable to watch.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 06, 2025 07:08 AM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/analysis/stocks-week-ahead-credit-markets-private-equity-bets-flash-warning-signs-200667979)\n\n**Credit Markets May Become Even Stranger**\nThe article explains how the credit spread between corporate bonds and sovereign debt has narrowed to historically low levels, with some companies even paying lower rates than governments. According to the ICE BofA Corporate index, U.S. investment\u2011grade firms now borrow at an average of only 0.74 percentage points above reference rates, down from the decade\u2011long average of 1.24 points. In Europe the spread is 0.76 points, one of the lowest since the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008. High\u2011yield corporate debt is also near historic lows, with a spread of about 2.7 points over risk\u2011free U.S. and European rates, as reported by ICE BofA. Moody\u2019s estimates the long\u2011term default rate for high\u2011yield bonds at 4\u202f% and that creditors lose roughly 60\u202f% of their capital when such firms default, implying an expected annual loss of 2.4 points\u2014close to the current spread.\n\nThe article cites BNP Paribas analysts who noted on 15\u202fSeptember that 7\u202f% of French investment\u2011grade firms were trading below sovereign financing costs. It also references CreditSights data showing average leverage for high\u2011yield borrowers in Europe at 3.2\u00d7 EBITDA, slightly above the 2024 end\u2011year level, and for investment\u2011grade firms at 2.4\u00d7 EBITDA. The IMF projects euro\u2011zone, U.S. and U.K. sovereign debt to reach $73\u202ftrillion by 2030, up from $58\u202ftrillion today, with the top five advanced economies\u2019 debt expected to average 115\u202f% of GDP that year.\n\nThe piece argues that while the current low spreads may reflect rational demand for corporate debt amid high rates, they also signal a fragile market: a modest uptick in defaults could wipe out the risk premium for high\u2011yield bonds. It warns that sovereign debt is likely to deteriorate further, requiring higher returns to attract investors. The author quotes Viktor Hjort of BNP, who says \"in the current global environment, companies are the defensive asset and sovereigns the risky asset\". The article concludes that if a corporate credit crisis does not materialise, the phenomenon of negative spreads could become more common, citing Microsoft as an example of a firm whose bonds now trade only 2 basis points above U.S. Treasury yields.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 25, 2025 03:59 AM\nSource:[Cinco D\u00edas](https://cincodias.elpais.com/opinion/2025-09-25/los-mercados-crediticios-podrian-ponerse-aun-mas-extranos.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
