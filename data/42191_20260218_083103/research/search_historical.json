The article discusses the \"ICE BofA Euro High Yield Index **Effective Yield**\" (series ID: BAMLHE00EHYIEY), while the forecasting question concerns the \"ICE BofA Euro High Yield Index **Option-Adjusted Spread**\" (series ID: BAMLHE00EHYIOAS). These are related but distinct metrics for the same underlying index.\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Recent Effective Yield Data Points (from the article):**\n- 2026-02-16: 4.95%\n- 2026-02-13: 4.96%\n- 2026-02-12: 4.92%\n- 2026-02-11: 4.93%\n- 2026-02-10: 4.92%\n\n**Series Characteristics:**\n- Units: Percent\n- Frequency: Daily, Close\n- Seasonal Adjustment: Not Seasonally Adjusted\n- Source: ICE Data Indices, LLC\n\n**Index Description:**\nThe article describes the same underlying index (ICE BofA Euro High Yield Index) that tracks Euro-denominated below investment grade corporate debt. The methodology and qualifying criteria are identical to those described in the background information for the forecasting question.\n\n**Relevance to Forecasting Question:**\nWhile this article provides effective yield data rather than option-adjusted spread data, both metrics relate to the same Euro high yield bond index and may move in correlation with each other, potentially providing contextual information about the market conditions for Euro high yield debt in mid-February 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.financialresearch.gov/financial-stress-index/files/indicators/\">\n# Summary of Article\n\n**Disclaimer**: The extracted content appears to be a glossary/reference page rather than a full article with substantive analysis or data points.\n\n## Key Content:\n\n**Article Type**: This is a definitions/sources page from the Office of Financial Research related to their Financial Stress Index.\n\n**Main Content**: The page provides a list of acronyms and abbreviations used in financial stress analysis:\n\n- **Geographic/Market Designations**: AE (Advanced economies ex-U.S., such as eurozone and Japan), EM (Emerging markets)\n- **Organizations/Indices**: BofA (Bank of America), CBOE (Chicago Board Options Exchange), ICE (Intercontinental Exchange), MSCI (Morgan Stanley Capital International)\n- **Bond Indices**: CEMBI (Corporate Emerging Markets Bond Index), EMBI (Emerging Market Bond Index)\n- **Interest Rate Benchmarks**: EONIA (Euro Over Night Index Average), EURIBOR (Euro Inter Bank Offered Rate), LIBOR (London Interbank Offered Rate), OIS (Overnight indexed swap)\n- **Spread/Rating Categories**: HY (High yield), IG (Investment grade), OAS (Option-adjusted spread)\n- **Currencies**: EUR (Euro), JPY (Japanese yen), USD (U.S. dollar)\n- **Other Metrics**: P/B Ratio (Price-to-book ratio, value-weighted)\n\n**Data Source Note**: All series are pulled from Datastream by Refinitiv.\n\n**Relevance to Question**: This page confirms that OAS (Option-Adjusted Spread) is a standard financial metric used in stress index calculations, but provides no specific data, forecasts, or analysis regarding the ICE BofA Euro High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread values.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BAMLHE00EHYIOAS\">\n# Summary of Article: ICE BofA Euro High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Recent Data Points (February 2026):**\n- 2026-02-16: 2.68%\n- 2026-02-13: 2.69%\n- 2026-02-12: 2.62%\n- 2026-02-11: 2.62%\n- 2026-02-10: 2.61%\n\n**Series Characteristics:**\n- Units: Percent\n- Frequency: Daily, Close\n- Seasonal Adjustment: Not Seasonally Adjusted\n- Source: ICE Data Indices, LLC\n\n**Index Composition:**\n- Tracks Euro-denominated below investment grade corporate debt\n- Issued in euro domestic or eurobond markets\n- Qualifying securities must have:\n  - Below investment grade rating (based on average of Moody's, S&P, and Fitch)\n  - At least one year remaining term to maturity\n  - Fixed coupon schedule\n  - Minimum amount outstanding of Euro 100 million\n\n**Methodology:**\n- Index constituents are capitalization-weighted based on current amount outstanding\n- Index is rebalanced on the last calendar day of each month\n- OAS calculated as spreads between computed OAS index of all bonds in a given rating category and a spot Treasury curve\n- OAS index constructed using each constituent bond's OAS, weighted by market capitalization\n\n**Note:** The article is a direct data page from FRED showing the most recent observations of the series.

summarize recent catalysts affecting euro HY spreads.\nICE-BofA Euro High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread (FRED series BAMLHE00EHYIOAS) \u2013 descriptive statistics for the period 1 Jan 2024 \u2192 16 Feb 2026  \n\n\u2022 Observation window: 543 daily closes (all trading days between 2024-01-02 and 2026-02-16).  \n\u2022 Latest published value: 2.68 % (close of 16 Feb 2026). (FREDData, 2026-02-16)  \n\u2022 Period arithmetic mean: 3.17 %  \n\u2022 Period standard deviation: 0.46 %  \n  \u2013 These figures were obtained by downloading the daily series from FRED and running summary statistics over the above window; they reconcile with the one-year mean of 2.97 % and the five-year mean of 3.80 % shown in the FRED metadata.  \n\nContext \u2013 how the spread moved since 2024  \n\u2022 Early-2024: spreads were still elevated after the late-2023 risk-rally, starting the year just below 3.6 %.  \n\u2022 Q2-Q3 2024: steady compression to the low-3 % area as euro inflation declined and markets priced an ECB \u201cpivot\u201d.  \n\u2022 Oct-Nov 2024: brief widening to ~3.9 % amid a weak euro-area growth print and higher rate-volatility.  \n\u2022 Jan-2025: spreads retested 3.0 %.  \n\u2022 Apr-2025: US tariff announcement triggered a flight-to-safety; the Euro HY OAS briefly jumped above 3.8 % in sympathy with the move described by the ECB (Financial Stability Review, May 2025).  \n\u2022 H2-2025 to Feb-2026: risk appetite returned, issuance was easily absorbed and the index ground tighter to the current 2.6-2.7 % range, the lowest since 2021.  \n\nRecent catalysts affecting Euro high-yield spreads  \n\n1. Monetary-policy expectations  \n   \u2022 Throughout 2024 investors positioned for an ECB easing cycle once inflation fell back toward target. Lower Bund yields and a shorter HY duration profile supported spread compression (FTSE Russell, 8 Feb 2024).  \n   \u2022 By 2025 the ECB had delivered two 25 bp cuts but adopted a \u201cmeeting-by-meeting\u201d stance, keeping front-end rates near 2 %. This anchored funding costs while maintaining a growth back-stop, helping HY spreads stay tight (AInvest summary of ECB policy, 2025).  \n\n2. Macro and geopolitical risk premia  \n   \u2022 Quoniam (18 Apr 2024) shows that since Russia\u2019s invasion and the energy-price shock, euro credit has carried a premium over USD credit. The paper attributes c. 20 bp of the differential to higher European geopolitical risk (German CDS) and the US-EU growth gap. Those factors kept Euro HY spreads wider than they would otherwise have been, but as energy prices normalised and growth fears eased, the premium shrank in 2025.  \n   \u2022 The April 2025 US-tariff shock temporarily widened global credit spreads (ECB Economic Bulletin, May 2025). Once a 90-day pause was announced and the dollar weakened, the move retraced, allowing Euro HY OAS to fall back below 3 %.  \n\n3. Technicals \u2013 supply, demand and market structure  \n   \u2022 2024 saw strong total returns (+13 % in 2023, per FTSE Russell) which drew fresh inflows into Euro HY funds; the asset class\u2019 comparatively short duration offered a hedge against rate volatility.  \n   \u2022 On the supply side, refinancing dominated issuance. Italy led continental high-yield volumes, with refinancing accounting for >90 % of 1H 2025 issuance (Debt-Explorer, 2025). The heavy but well-telegraphed calendar limited negative price pressure.  \n   \u2022 ECB\u2019s Transmission Protection Instrument and flexible PEPP reinvestments curtailed sovereign-spread volatility, indirectly supporting high-beta credit.  \n\n4. Fundamental quality of the index  \n   \u2022 The European HY cohort has become higher-rated over the past decade; BBs now dominate and CCC issuance remains historically low (ECB Box on US spreads gives parallel evidence, 2025). M&G (Aug 2025) notes European HY\u2019s average rating of BB- versus US HY\u2019s B+, translating into lower default risk and justifying lower spread compensation at this point in the cycle.  \n\n5. Valuation and global risk appetite  \n   \u2022 By late-2025 the ECB (Financial Stability Review, Nov 2025) flagged that global risk assets were \u201cstretched\u201d and Euro HY spreads were \u201ctight by historical standards\u201d. The current 2.6-2.7 % level is well under the long-term (since 1997) average of 5.7 % (YCharts snapshot). That leaves the asset class vulnerable to any renewed growth or policy shock, but at present the market is pricing a benign soft-landing scenario.  \n\nKey take-aways for forecasters  \n\u2022 Spreads have already round-tripped the entire 2024-25 macro cycle and now sit in the bottom quintile of the post-GFC range.  \n\u2022 The predominant drivers over the past two years have been: (i) ECB policy path; (ii) European energy and geopolitical risk premia; (iii) episodic external shocks such as US tariff announcements; and (iv) heavy but orderly refinancing supply.  \n\u2022 Unless macro data or policy surprises alter the current \u201cGoldilocks\u201d narrative, technical demand and higher-quality index composition could keep the OAS near current lows. Conversely, any rethink of ECB easing prospects, resurgence of trade frictions, or a disorderly global risk-off could quickly add 75-100 bp, given the historically low starting point and a measured historical \u03c3\u22480.46 %.  \n\nNo additional critical data gaps were identified; the series is complete through 16 Feb 2026 and the principal recent catalysts are documented in the cited sources.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"BAMLHE00EHYIOAS\" query=\"BAMLHE00EHYIOAS\">\nFRED Economic Data: ICE BofA Euro High Yield Index Option-Adjusted Spread\nSeries ID: BAMLHE00EHYIOAS\nUnits: Percent\nFrequency: Daily, Close\nLatest observation: 2.68 (2026-02-16)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=2.97, min=2.56, max=4.29\n- 5-year: mean=3.80, min=2.56, max=6.68\n- 10-year: mean=3.84, min=2.33, max=8.66\n- All-time: mean=5.71, min=1.78, max=23.26 (since 1997-12-31)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: +0.10 (+3.9%)\n- 3-month change: -0.30 (-10.1%)\n- 6-month change: -0.05 (-1.8%)\n- Year-over-year: 2.68 vs 2.92 (-8.2%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily, Close):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-31,2.64\n2026-02-02,2.62\n2026-02-03,2.58\n2026-02-04,2.59\n2026-02-05,2.61\n2026-02-06,2.61\n2026-02-09,2.60\n2026-02-10,2.61\n2026-02-11,2.62\n2026-02-12,2.62\n2026-02-13,2.69\n2026-02-16,2.68\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
