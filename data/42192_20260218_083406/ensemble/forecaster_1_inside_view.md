Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Google Trends Primary Data (Feb 18, 2026):**
- **Quality:** Highest reliability - direct measurement system
- **Key facts:** "president day" at 100 on Feb 16 (Presidents Day), dropped to 20 on Feb 17, currently 9 on Feb 18. Historical 90-day data shows baseline mean of 9.3
- **Pattern:** Severe post-holiday collapse from peak to baseline already occurred

**News Articles (Feb 16-17, 2026):**
Multiple sources (Sakshi Post, KYMA, Epoch Times, Merca2.0, JagranJosh, Yahoo, Yeshiva World, Mashable, Patch) published Feb 16-17 covering:
- **Factual content:** Presidents Day observed Feb 16, 2026; federal closures; retail sales ongoing
- **Retail sales emphasis:** Mashable (Feb 16) reports "live updates" on deals from Amazon, Apple, Best Buy, Walmart; NBC Select (Feb 17) notes sales "still live" day after holiday
- **Quality:** Mainstream news sources, factually accurate about holiday observance
- **Limitation:** These describe the holiday itself, not post-holiday search patterns

**Historical Context Articles:**
- **2019 retail precedent:** Agent report cites Dell, Macy's, Best Buy, Lowe's running promotions "through Feb 24" (8 days post-holiday)
- **Consumer Reports 2026 prediction:** Expects extended sales on mattresses/appliances
- **Quality:** Moderate - establishes historical pattern but single reference class

**Political Context:**
- George W. Bush op-ed (Feb 17) criticizing Trump on Presidents Day
- Trump tariff news mentioned in agent report
- **Quality:** Factual events but speculative connection to search term "president day" (vs "president" or "trump")

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Current Google Trends data showing baseline collapse:** Value already at 9 (baseline mean 9.3) on Feb 18. This is the most critical fact - we're starting from a post-collapse baseline, not a peak.
   - *Impact:* Severely limits downside potential (<6 would be below typical baseline range 6-13)
   - *Direction:* Favors "Doesn't change" or "Increases"

2. **Base rate from 90-day data:** 65% of 8-day windows show ≤3 point changes
   - *Impact:* Strong anchor suggesting stability at baseline
   - *Direction:* Strongly favors "Doesn't change"

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Extended retail sales pattern:** Multiple sources (Mashable Feb 16, NBC Select Feb 17) confirm sales continuing post-holiday; historical 2019 precedent shows promotions through Feb 24
   - *Causal mechanism:* Retail promotions → people search "president day sales" or "presidents day deals" → drives search volume
   - *Limitation:* Unclear if searches use exact term "president day" vs "presidents day sales"
   - *Impact:* Could create secondary bump above baseline
   - *Direction:* Moderately favors "Increases"

2. **Consumer Reports forward-looking prediction:** Expects extended 2026 sales
   - *Quality:* Identifiable expert source (retail insights)
   - *Impact:* Suggests retail activity will continue through the week
   - *Direction:* Moderately favors "Increases"

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Political news (Bush op-ed, tariffs):** While factual, connection to search term "president day" (vs "president" or "trump") is speculative
   - *Impact:* Minimal - unlikely to drive searches for holiday-specific term
   - *Direction:* Slight favor to "Increases" but negligible

2. **Typical baseline variation:** Jan 20-Feb 11 data shows 6-13 range, mostly 8-11
   - *Impact:* Suggests natural fluctuation could move value ±2-4 points
   - *Direction:* Supports "Doesn't change" staying within 6-12 range

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window:** 8 days (Feb 18 to Feb 26, 2026)
**Current position:** Day 1 of 8, starting at value 9

**If timeframe halved (4 days, Feb 18-22):**
- Less time for retail promotions to generate renewed interest
- Would increase "Doesn't change" probability to ~70%
- Decrease "Increases" to ~25%

**If timeframe doubled (16 days, Feb 18 to Mar 6):**
- More time for secondary events (retail clearance, political news)
- Would increase "Increases" probability to ~40%
- Decrease "Doesn't change" to ~50%
- Longer window allows more opportunity for ±3 threshold breach

**Critical insight:** The 8-day window is long enough for extended retail sales (historically documented through Feb 24 in 2019) to potentially drive a secondary bump, but we need movement >3 points from current baseline of 9.

## (d) Justification

**Starting from the outside view base rate:**
- Doesn't change: 60%
- Increases: 30%
- Decreases: 10%

**Key factors requiring adjustment:**

1. **Already at baseline (9) vs random starting point:**
   - The base rate treats all 8-day windows equally, but we're starting from a post-collapse baseline
   - Downside is limited: dropping from 9 to <6 would be unusual (only ~5% of baseline days go below 6 in the data)
   - **Adjustment:** Decrease "Decreases" from 10% to 5%

2. **Extended retail sales evidence (moderate strength):**
   - Multiple 2026 sources confirm sales continuing post-holiday
   - Historical 2019 precedent shows promotions through Feb 24 (6 days into our window)
   - Consumer Reports expert prediction supports extended activity
   - **Mechanism:** Retail searches could drive "president day" queries above baseline
   - **Counter-consideration:** Search term specificity unclear - might search "presidents day sales" instead
   - **Adjustment:** Increase "Increases" from 30% to 35%

3. **Threshold sensitivity (±3 points):**
   - Only need to reach 13 for "Increases" or drop to 5 for "Decreases"
   - Natural baseline variation is ±2-4 points
   - The threshold is relatively narrow given natural volatility
   - **Adjustment:** This cuts both ways - slightly increases both "Increases" and "Decreases" but we've already limited downside

4. **Time remaining (7 days):**
   - Sufficient for retail promotions to generate secondary interest
   - Historical pattern shows extended sales can maintain elevated (though not peak) search interest
   - **Adjustment:** Supports the increase to "Increases"

**Final calibration:**
- Decreases: 10% → 5% (limited downside from baseline)
- Increases: 30% → 35% (retail sales evidence + sufficient timeframe)
- Doesn't change: 60% → 60% (remains most likely given base rate and ±3 buffer)

**Verification of large shifts:**
The shifts are modest (5% reallocation from Decreases to Increases). This is appropriate because:
- The base rate (65% no change) remains highly relevant
- The retail sales evidence is moderate, not strong (single reference class, unclear search term specificity)
- We're still fundamentally in a post-holiday baseline period
- The ±3 threshold provides a buffer zone that absorbs normal variation

## Probability Calibration

**Status quo outcome:** Value stays near 9 (baseline mean 9.3), fluctuating within 6-12 range. This is the most likely scenario and aligns with the 60% "Doesn't change" prediction.

**If current trend continues:** The collapse from 100→20→9 suggests continued decay, but we're already at baseline floor. Natural baseline behavior is small fluctuations, not continued decline.

**Probability sensitivity check:**
- 60% "Doesn't change" = 3:2 odds that value stays 6-12
- 35% "Increases" = roughly 1:2 odds that retail promotions drive value >12
- 5% "Decreases" = 1:19 odds of dropping below 6

These ratios feel calibrated:
- The 3:2 odds for stability reflect strong base rate + baseline positioning
- The 1:2 odds for increase reflect moderate retail evidence but uncertainty about search term specificity
- The 1:19 odds for decrease reflect limited downside from baseline floor

**±10% sensitivity:**
- If "Doesn't change" were 70%: Would imply retail promotions have almost no effect - seems too conservative given documented extended sales
- If "Doesn't change" were 50%: Would imply much stronger retail effect - not supported by moderate evidence quality
- If "Increases" were 45%: Would require stronger evidence of retail-driven searches using exact term "president day"
- If "Increases" were 25%: Would underweight the documented historical pattern of extended promotions

The 60/35/5 distribution appropriately weights the evidence strength.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Google Trends value for "president day" on Feb 26 be >12 (Increases), 6-12 (Doesn't change), or <6 (Decreases) compared to Feb 18 value of 9?
   - ✓ Aligned with resolution criteria (±3 threshold)

2. **Base rate:** Outside view: 60% Doesn't change, 30% Increases, 10% Decreases
   - ✓ Final prediction (60/35/5) remains rooted to this base rate with modest adjustments

3. **Consistency check:** Most likely = Doesn't change (60%); Least likely = Decreases (5%)
   - ✓ Makes sense: already at baseline floor limits downside, retail sales provide upside potential

4. **Top evidence pieces:**
   - Current value already at baseline (9) - limits downside potential
   - Base rate shows 65% of 8-day windows have ≤3 point changes
   - Multiple sources confirm extended retail sales post-holiday (Feb 16-17 articles)
   - Historical 2019 precedent shows promotions through Feb 24
   - Natural baseline variation typically ±2-4 points

5. **Blind-spot scenario:** Viral news event or major political development using "president day" in headlines could spike searches unexpectedly. This would make "Increases" look underestimated. However, such events are unpredictable and not supported by current evidence. If this occurred, shift 15-20% from "Doesn't change" to "Increases."

6. **Status quo:** Value staying 6-12 (current baseline behavior) is most likely. The 8-day timeframe is moderate volatility - not so short that nothing can happen, not so long that major shifts are expected. 60% for status quo feels appropriate.

7. **Technicalities:** ✓ Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs, all between 0-100
