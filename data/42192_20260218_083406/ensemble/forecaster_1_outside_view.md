Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Google Trends Data (Feb 18, 2026):**
- **Quality:** Primary data source, highly reliable
- **Key facts:** Shows "president day" peaked at 100 on Feb 16 (Presidents Day), dropped to 20 on Feb 17, and fell to 9 on Feb 18 (today). The 90-day base rate shows 65% of 8-day windows have changes ≤3 points, 24% increase >3 points, 11% decrease >3 points.
- **Pattern:** Classic post-holiday collapse from peak to baseline

**KPRC Article (Feb 16, 2026):**
- **Quality:** Recent local news, factual reporting
- **Key facts:** 200,000+ nationwide searches on Presidents Day itself (Feb 16), with searches focused on holiday-related questions (mail, banks, schools)
- **Relevance:** Confirms the Feb 16 peak but doesn't address post-holiday patterns

**Agent Report on Historical Patterns:**
- **Quality:** Synthesized research with specific citations
- **Key facts:** 
  - 2019: Major retailers (Dell, Macy's, Best Buy, Lowe's) ran promotions "through Feb 24" (6 days post-holiday)
  - 2026: Consumer Reports predicts extended sales on mattresses/appliances over Presidents Day weekend
  - Tariff news (Trump-Europe dispute) ongoing, could generate political search interest
- **Expert opinion:** Consumer Reports' forward-looking retail advice suggests extended sales likely
- **Relevance:** High - directly addresses mechanisms for post-holiday interest maintenance

**Other Historical Articles:**
- Mashable (2017), Brookings (2026), CNN (2025), Fortune, The Week: These provide general context about presidential topics but lack direct relevance to the specific question about post-Presidents Day search trends

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **8-day windows in the 90-day Google Trends data:** 65% no change, 24% increase, 11% decrease
2. **Post-holiday search patterns for seasonal terms:** Typically show sharp declines after the event
3. **Post-Presidents Day weeks specifically (2016-2025):** Agent report suggests secondary bumps occur due to extended retail sales and political news

**Most suitable:** The 8-day window base rate from the Google Trends data, adjusted for the specific post-holiday context. The current situation (Feb 18-26) spans the immediate post-holiday period where we'd expect:
- Natural decay from the holiday peak
- Potential secondary bump from extended retail promotions (historically documented for 2019)
- Possible political news catalyst (2026 tariff dispute)

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window:** 8 days (Feb 18 to Feb 26, 2026)
**Current position:** Feb 18 value is 9 (already at baseline, down from 100 on Feb 16)

**Historical pattern from Google Trends data:**
- Feb 16: 100 (peak)
- Feb 17: 20 (80% drop)
- Feb 18: 9 (91% drop from peak, baseline level)

**Key observation:** The value has already collapsed to 9, which is at the 90-day mean (9.3). For the question to resolve as "Increases," the Feb 26 value must be >12 (9+3). For "Decreases," it must be <6 (9-3).

**Typical baseline behavior:** Looking at Jan 20-Feb 11 (pre-holiday buildup), values ranged 6-13, mostly 8-11. This suggests natural variation at baseline is typically ±2-4 points.

## (d) Justification

The current value (9 on Feb 18) is already at baseline after the Presidents Day peak. The question asks whether interest will change between Feb 18-26.

**Factors favoring "Doesn't change" (stays 6-12):**
- Already at baseline mean (9.3)
- Natural variation at baseline is small (±2-4 points typically)
- Post-holiday interest typically remains low
- Base rate: 65% of 8-day windows show ≤3 point changes

**Factors favoring "Increases" (>12 on Feb 26):**
- Extended retail sales documented historically (2019 example through Feb 24)
- Consumer Reports prediction of extended 2026 sales
- Ongoing Trump tariff news could generate political searches
- However, retail promotions would need to be very prominent to drive searches back up from baseline

**Factors favoring "Decreases" (<6 on Feb 26):**
- Already very low (9), limited room to fall further
- Would require dropping below typical baseline range
- Less likely given normal variation

**Critical insight:** The value is already at baseline. Extended retail sales might create a small uptick (historically seen as secondary bumps), but the question is whether it exceeds the ±3 threshold. The base rate suggests most 8-day periods stay within ±3 points.

## Outside view calibration:

The base rate (65% no change, 24% increase, 11% decrease) provides a strong anchor. However, this specific window has contextual factors:

1. **Post-holiday positioning:** We're starting from a collapsed baseline (9), not a random point
2. **Extended sales evidence:** Historical precedent (2019) and forward-looking predictions (Consumer Reports) suggest retail activity continues
3. **Threshold sensitivity:** Only need >3 point movement to trigger "change"

The 24% base rate for increases seems reasonable but might be slightly elevated given:
- Documented retail extension patterns
- Current political news environment
- Starting from baseline (easier to rise than fall further)

The 11% base rate for decreases seems high given we're already at baseline mean. Natural variation rarely drops below 6-7 in the data.

Adjusting for context: The probability should shift slightly toward "Increases" (retail/news catalysts) and away from "Decreases" (already at floor), while "Doesn't change" remains most likely given the ±3 buffer zone.

## Outside View Prediction:

Increases: 30%
Doesn't change: 60%
Decreases: 10%
