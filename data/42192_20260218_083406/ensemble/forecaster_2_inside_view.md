Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Google Trends Data (18 Feb 2026)**
- **Quality**: Primary source, machine-generated, highest reliability
- **Key Facts**: Value was 100 on Mon 16 Feb (Presidents Day) → 20 on Tue 17 Feb → 9 on Wed 18 Feb (today, the forecast opening date)
- **90-day statistics**: In 8-day windows, 65% stayed within ±3 points, 24% increased >3, 11% decreased >3

**AskNews Articles (Feb 9-17, 2026)**
Multiple articles from reputable sources (NBC, Yahoo, Mashable, USA Today, etc.) published between Feb 9-17, 2026:
- **Factual content**: Presidents Day was observed Monday, Feb 16, 2026. Federal offices, banks, post offices closed. Retail stores remained open with major sales.
- **Key observation**: All articles describe Presidents Day as a past event (published Feb 16-17), confirming the holiday peak has passed
- **Sales context**: Multiple sources mention Presidents Day sales continuing beyond the Monday holiday, with retailers extending promotions
- **Quality**: High reliability for factual information about what occurred on/around Feb 16

**NBC Select article (Feb 17, 2026)**
- **Quote from expert**: Stephanie Carls (retail insights expert) calls Presidents Day "one of the strongest sales moments of the year" for mattresses
- **Key fact**: Article published Feb 17 notes sales are "still live" after the holiday
- **Relevance**: Suggests commercial activity and potentially search interest extends beyond the Monday

**Mashable live deals article (Feb 16, 2026)**
- Published morning of Presidents Day, tracking live deals from Amazon, Apple, Best Buy, Walmart
- Describes it as "one of the first major sales of the year"
- **Relevance**: Indicates strong commercial promotion on the day itself

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Google Trends hard data**: Value dropped from 100 (Mon 16th) to 9 (Wed 18th) - an 91% collapse in two days. This is the most reliable evidence available.
- **Holiday timing**: Presidents Day has definitively passed. The peak search interest event is behind us.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Extended sales**: Multiple independent sources (NBC, Mashable, retailers) confirm sales continuing beyond Monday. This could sustain some residual search interest.
- **Historical pattern from 90-day data**: 65% of 8-day windows show no change >3 points, establishing a baseline expectation
- **Floor effect**: At value=9, there's limited room to decrease further (would need to drop to ≤5 for "Decreases" resolution)

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Retail email campaigns**: Speculative suggestion that extended sale promotions might drive searches later in week
- **Weekend shopping patterns**: Possible minor uptick on Sat/Sun Feb 22-23 as people shop extended sales

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 8 days (Feb 18-26, 2026)
- Starting point: Wed Feb 18 (value=9)
- Endpoint: Thu Feb 26 (value=?)
- Resolution criteria: If Feb 26 value is within 6-12 range → "Doesn't change"; >12 → "Increases"; <6 → "Decreases"

**If timeframe were halved (4 days to Feb 22)**:
- Would increase "Doesn't change" probability significantly (70%+) as less time for volatility
- Weekend Feb 22-23 might show slight uptick from extended sales, but unlikely to breach threshold

**If timeframe were doubled (16 days to Mar 6)**:
- Would increase "Decreases" probability as we move further from holiday relevance
- Natural decay toward baseline would likely push value lower
- However, floor effects limit downside

## (d) Justification

**Key factors shifting from outside view:**

1. **Starting position is already at floor (9)**: The outside view's 11% "Decreases" probability assumed typical mid-range starting values. At 9, we need to drop to ≤5 (a 44% decline from already-low levels) for "Decreases" to resolve. This is structurally difficult.

2. **Post-holiday tail pattern**: We're not in a random 8-day window; we're in the immediate aftermath of a massive spike. The 90-day statistics include mostly normal weeks, making them less analogous. Post-holiday patterns typically show:
   - Rapid initial collapse (already occurred: 100→9)
   - Stabilization at low baseline
   - Occasional minor bumps from extended promotions

3. **Extended sales promotion**: Multiple credible sources confirm retailers are actively promoting "Presidents Day sales still live" on Feb 17. This commercial activity could sustain search interest slightly above absolute floor, but unlikely to drive >3 point increase to 13+.

4. **8-day window with weekend**: The forecast period includes Sat-Sun Feb 22-23, when retail shopping activity peaks. This increases chances of minor uptick versus a pure weekday window.

**Shifts from outside view (27% Increase, 58% No-change, 15% Decrease):**

- **Decrease probability should drop**: From 15% to ~8%. Floor effect makes further decline structurally difficult.
- **No-change probability should increase**: From 58% to ~70%. Post-holiday stabilization pattern plus floor effect makes this most likely.
- **Increase probability should drop slightly**: From 27% to ~22%. While extended sales exist, the value would need to reach 13+ (44% increase from 9), which is substantial. Historical patterns suggest minor bumps of 1-3 points are possible, but >3 is less likely.

## Probability Calibration

**Status quo continuation**: If nothing changes, value stays at 9 → "Doesn't change" (within 6-12 range)

**Most likely scenario**: Value fluctuates between 7-11 throughout the week, staying within the ±3 threshold. This aligns with:
- Post-holiday stabilization patterns
- Floor effects limiting downside
- Extended sales providing minor support
- Historical 65% base rate for no-change in 8-day windows

**Increase scenario (value >12)**: Requires 44%+ increase from current 9. Would need:
- Viral content mentioning "president day"
- Unexpected news event linking to presidents
- Major retailer campaign specifically using "president day" search term
- Probability: ~20-22%

**Decrease scenario (value <6)**: Requires 33%+ decrease from already-low 9. Would need:
- Complete abandonment of topic
- No weekend shopping bump
- Structurally difficult given floor effects
- Probability: ~8-10%

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Google Trends value for "president day" on Feb 26 be within ±3 of Feb 18 value (9)? Increases if >12, Decreases if <6, else No-change.

2. **Base rate**: Outside view was 27% Increase, 58% No-change, 15% Decrease. My inside view shifts to ~22% Increase, ~70% No-change, ~8% Decrease.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = "Doesn't change" (post-holiday stabilization at floor); Least likely = "Decreases" (limited room to fall). This makes sense given we're at value=9 already.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Value already collapsed to 9 (factual, Google Trends)
   - Presidents Day has passed (factual, multiple sources)
   - Extended sales continuing (factual, NBC/Mashable)
   - Floor effect limits downside (structural)
   - 8-day window includes weekend (temporal)

5. **Blind-spot**: A viral social media event or unexpected presidential news could drive searches back up >3 points, making "Increases" resolve. This would make my 70% "No-change" look overconfident. However, such events are rare and unpredictable.

6. **Status quo**: Current value=9. Status quo is stability at this low level → "Doesn't change". Given post-holiday patterns typically stabilize, slight nudge toward status quo is warranted.

7. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [22, 70, 8]
