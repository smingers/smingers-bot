Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Google Trends Data (Feb 18, 2026):** This is the most critical source. It shows actual search interest values with Feb 16 at 100 (peak), Feb 17 at 20, and Feb 18 at 9. This represents hard data rather than opinion. The 90-day base rate analysis shows 65% of 8-day windows have changes ≤3 points, 24% increase >3 points, and 11% decrease >3 points.

**KPRC Article (Feb 16, 2026):** Reports 200,000+ nationwide searches on Presidents Day (Feb 16, 2026). This is factual reporting of search volumes on the actual holiday. High quality, directly relevant, and timely.

**Agent Report:** Provides historical context about retail promotions extending beyond Presidents Day (2019 example through Feb 24), and notes Consumer Reports predicting 2026 sales on appliances/mattresses. The report identifies two potential catalysts for renewed interest: (1) extended retail sales and (2) ongoing Trump tariff news. Quality is good for identifying mechanisms, though some claims lack direct verification.

**Mashable (2017):** Describes Google Arts & Culture promotional activities around Presidents Day in 2017. While this shows historical precedent for Google promoting presidential content, it's 9 years old and may not reflect 2026 practices. Limited relevance.

**Other sources (Brookings 2026, CNN 2025, Fortune, The Week 2025):** These discuss Trump administration topics, government shutdowns, and trade wars but don't directly address "president day" search patterns. They provide general political context but limited forecasting value.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **Post-holiday search decay patterns for "president day"** - Most suitable. The Google Trends data shows a clear pattern: peak on Feb 16 (100), sharp drop to 20 on Feb 17, further drop to 9 on Feb 18.

2. **8-day window changes in Google Trends for this term** - Highly relevant. Base rate shows 65% "no change" (≤3 points), 24% increase, 11% decrease.

3. **Retail promotion cycles around Presidents Day** - Moderately relevant. Historical evidence suggests promotions extend through the week, potentially sustaining some search interest.

**Most suitable reference class:** The 8-day window base rate from the actual Google Trends data for "president day," combined with the observed post-holiday decay pattern.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction timeframe:** 8 days (Feb 18-26, 2026)

**Starting point:** Feb 18 value is 9 (already 91 points below the Feb 16 peak)

**Historical pattern observed:**
- Feb 16: 100 (Presidents Day - peak)
- Feb 17: 20 (80-point drop)
- Feb 18: 9 (11-point drop, continuing decay)

**Key observations:**
- The term shows extreme volatility around the actual holiday
- Post-holiday, interest drops precipitously
- The 90-day mean is 9.3, and Feb 18 is already at 9 - essentially at baseline
- For "Increases" outcome: Feb 26 would need to be >12 (9+3)
- For "Decreases" outcome: Feb 26 would need to be <6 (9-3)
- For "Doesn't change": Feb 26 would need to be 6-12

**(d) Justification:**

The Google Trends data shows "president day" has already returned to its 90-day baseline (9 vs mean of 9.3) by Feb 18. The dramatic spike to 100 on Feb 16 was the actual holiday, and the subsequent crash to 9 represents typical post-holiday search decay.

**Factors favoring "Doesn't change" (6-12 range):**
- Already at baseline; further large drops are unlikely
- 90-day standard deviation is 11.1, suggesting values typically cluster around the mean
- Base rate shows 65% of 8-day windows stay within ±3 points
- No major presidential events scheduled Feb 18-26

**Factors favoring "Decreases" (<6):**
- Could drop slightly below baseline as residual holiday interest fully dissipates
- However, already at mean makes significant further decline unlikely

**Factors favoring "Increases" (>12):**
- Agent report mentions extended retail sales (historically through Feb 24)
- Ongoing Trump tariff news could generate "president"-related searches
- However, retail promotions typically use "Presidents Day" (correct spelling) in marketing
- The misspelling "president day" is more likely a user error during peak holiday interest
- No evidence of significant secondary spikes in the provided daily data

The most probable scenario is that the value remains near baseline (6-12 range) through Feb 26, with slight fluctuations that stay within the ±3 threshold.

**Outside view calibration:**

The base rate of 65% for "no change" in 8-day windows is compelling. However, I must consider:

1. **Starting position matters:** We're starting from baseline (9), not from an elevated or depressed value. This makes extreme movements less likely.

2. **Post-holiday context:** The question specifically covers the post-holiday period when interest has already crashed. This is different from random 8-day windows that might include the holiday itself.

3. **Asymmetry in outcomes:** From a value of 9, it's easier to increase by 4 points (to 13) than decrease by 4 points (to 5), since we're already near the floor. The 90-day minimum appears to be around 6-7.

4. **Historical upset rate:** Google Trends for holiday-related terms typically show predictable patterns. Major deviations require specific catalysts (news events, promotions). The agent report identifies potential catalysts but provides no strong evidence they'll materialize or affect the misspelled term.

5. **Calibration adjustment:** The 65% base rate should be weighted more heavily given we're starting from baseline. The 24% "increase" rate seems too high for a post-holiday period starting from baseline. The 11% "decrease" rate seems reasonable but limited by the floor effect.

**Revised probability assessment:**
- "Doesn't change": 70% (higher than base rate due to baseline starting position)
- "Decreases": 15% (possible but limited by floor effect)
- "Increases": 15% (possible but requires specific catalyst; retail/news factors uncertain)

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 15%
Doesn't change: 70%
Decreases: 15%
