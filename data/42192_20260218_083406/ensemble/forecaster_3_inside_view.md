Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase, <30 words)
- Using the fixed US Google Trends URL (2026-01-27 to 2026-02-26), compare “president day” values on 2026-02-18 vs 2026-02-26: +>3 = Increases, within ±3 = Doesn’t change, <-3 = Decreases.

2) (a) Source analysis (what each says + quality/date)

- Google Trends datapoint described in prompt / outside-view work (Feb 16–18 values, baseline stats):
  - Factual, directly tied to resolution. Highest quality evidence. However, note potential mismatch between the “last 30 days” view cited and the *verification URL window* (Jan 27–Feb 26), though both are dominated by the Feb 16 spike.

- NBC News Select (Feb 17, 2026) Presidents Day deals still live:
  - Reputable outlet; timely. Fact: sales continue after the holiday. This can extend some residual searching, but typically fades quickly after the “deal weekend.”

- Mashable live Presidents’ Day deals (Feb 16, 2026):
  - Reputable; timely. Fact: heavy deal coverage on/around Feb 16 implies peak interest centered on the holiday weekend.

- “What’s open/closed” articles (multiple, Feb 16–17, 2026; e.g., Sakshi Post, JagranJosh, Epoch Times mirrors, etc.):
  - Mixed outlet quality, but they report standard holiday-closure facts. Timely but largely explanatory content that usually peaks right before/at the holiday, then decays.

- Ya Libnan (Feb 17, 2026) Bush “Presidents’ Day message” criticizing Trump:
  - Lower-tier outlet, potentially editorialized. Even if true, it’s dated Feb 17 and is unlikely to create a *Feb 26* search resurgence for the misspelled/singular term “president day.”

- USA Today/Yahoo (Feb 16, 2026) national parks fee-free day:
  - Reasonably reliable and timely. Supports the idea of holiday-day searches, not late-tail searches.

- Fox Sports NFL coaching tracker (Feb 17, 2026) + Yahoo Finance mortgage rates (Feb 17, 2026):
  - Credible but irrelevant to “president day” searches.

- Mashable 2017 inauguration-related Trends story:
  - Reputable but very old and not about this holiday term’s late-tail pattern; weak relevance.

3) (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence
- Structural/seasonal pattern: Presidents Day search interest spikes on/just before Feb 16 and then drops sharply afterward. The prompt’s concrete recent pattern (100 → 20 → 9 from Feb 16–18) strongly implies ongoing decay into late February.
- Resolution window is entirely post-holiday (Feb 18–26), so the dominant causal driver (the holiday itself) is already past.

Moderate evidence
- Continuing retail promotions (“deals still live” coverage) can prop up residual searches for a few days, but this is usually a short tail and more concentrated Feb 17–20 than Feb 26.
- The outside-view base rate you computed (65% “within 3” over 8-day windows) is informative but may be less applicable because we are on the downslope of a one-off holiday spike rather than in a stationary period.

Weak evidence
- Political commentary tied to Presidents’ Day (e.g., Bush message) could create small, brief bumps, but unlikely to persist to Feb 26 for the specific query “president day.”
- Any unrelated contemporaneous news (NFL, mortgages) should not affect this term.

4) (c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left: 8 days (Feb 18 to Feb 26).
- If halved (to ~4 days, Feb 18→Feb 22): “Doesn’t change” would become more likely because the residual post-holiday tail may not fully dissipate yet.
- If doubled (~16 days, Feb 18→early March): “Decreases” would become more likely because the term would have more time to revert to near-minimum baseline.

5) (d) Justification: shifting from outside view to inside view
Outside view base rates (given): Increases 15 / Doesn’t change 70 / Decreases 15.

Inside-view update:
- The key inside-view fact is the *observed steep decline already underway* (holiday peak passed; Feb 18 already far below peak). With 8 additional days, the most natural continuation is further mean reversion/decay, making “Decreases” more likely than in a generic 8-day window.
- The main counterweight is the “floor effect” and the ±3 band: once values are low, they can’t fall much more, which keeps “Doesn’t change” competitive.
- Net: shift probability mass from “Doesn’t change” toward “Decreases,” while “Increases” becomes less likely (it would require an unusual second-wave story that meaningfully lifts Feb 26 above Feb 18 by >3).

Probability calibration

Status quo continuation (most likely path):
- Continued post-holiday decay from Feb 18 to Feb 26.

I’m calibrating around the pivotal question: is Feb 26 more likely to be at least 4 points lower than Feb 18 (i.e., below 6 if Feb 18≈9), versus staying within ±3? I lean slightly toward a >3 drop given an 8-day tail after a holiday spike, but not overwhelmingly because values may already be near baseline by Feb 18.

Checklist:
1) Options/criteria: Compare Feb 26 vs Feb 18 on the fixed Jan27–Feb26 chart; >+3 increase, within ±3 no change, <-3 decrease.  
2) Outside view base rate: [15, 70, 15].  
3) Consistency check: Most likely = Decreases / Doesn’t change; Least likely = Increases; aligned with post-holiday decay logic.  
4) Key evidence (each <20 words):
   - Feb 16–18 observed drop: 100 → 20 → 9 indicates strong decay underway.
   - Window is entirely after the holiday; primary driver has passed.
   - Deal/closure articles cluster Feb 16–17, not late-window Feb 26.
   - Low baseline/floor effect keeps “Doesn’t change” plausible.
5) Blind spot: A late-Feb event/viral story triggers renewed “president day” searches, causing an increase.  
6) Status quo: gradual fading interest; nudges toward Decreases/Doesn’t change.  
7) Technicalities: probabilities 0–100, sum to 100, correct order.

Probabilities: [8, 44, 48]
