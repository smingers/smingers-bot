Analysis
1. Paraphrase of options & rule (≤30 words)  
Compare the Google-Trends value for “president day” (US, fixed 2026-01-27 – 02-26 range) on 18 Feb vs 26 Feb.  
>3 higher → “Increases”; within ±3 → “No change”; >3 lower → “Decreases”.

(a) Source analysis (quality, facts vs opinion)  
• Google Trends 30-day chart (Feb 16 peak = 100; Feb 17≈20; Feb 18≈9). Direct, quantitative, current – strongest factual source.  
• NBC-News (17 Feb 26) & other retail articles: all confirm extended “Presidents Day sales” messaging continues through at least the following weekend; factual quotes from retailers, low analytical bias.  
• Multiple “What’s open/closed” pieces (16–17 Feb 26, JagranJosh, USA Today-Yahoo, Patch, etc.). All factual, time-stamped; show media coverage remains but is already waning after 17 Feb.  
• Historic base-rate file (all 8-day windows last 90 days): 65 % no-change / 24 % increase / 11 % decrease. Quantitative, directly relevant.  
Opinion statements in these pieces (e.g., “one of the strongest sales moments of the year”) are noted but not given causal weight.

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong: empirical 8-day base-rate distribution; observed post-holiday drop already to single-digit value on 18 Feb; fixed-range scaling stabilises numbers.  
Moderate: recurring retail-sale coverage may cause a mild rebound close to Washington’s actual birthday (22 Feb); historical pattern of small bump detectable in past years (quick manual spot-check 2024, 2025).  
Weak: chance political headline creating surge; random sampling noise.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome in eight days.  If window were halved (to four days) I would raise “No change” by ~7 pts because less time for rebound.  If doubled (16 days) I’d tilt 5 pts from “No change” to “Increase” & “Decrease” (more drift possible).

(d) Justification & inside-view adjustment  
Status quo trajectory = sharp decay by 18 Feb, then flat baseline. That alone would keep Feb 26 within ±3 (supports “No change”).  
Up-pressure factors:  
1. Washington’s birthday on 22 Feb historically produces a small, brief spike.  
2. Ongoing “extended Presidents Day deals” ads through the weekend (news confirmation).  
Down-pressure factors:  
1. Baseline already low; further fall is arithmetically limited (can’t drop far below 0–5 on 100-scale), so “Decrease” has less headroom than “Increase”.  
Net: shift 5 pts from “No change” to “Increase”, keep “Decrease” roughly base-rate.

Probability calibration  
Outside-view: 24 / 65 / 11.  
Adjust +4 pts to Increase, –8 pts to No-change, +4 pts to Decrease yields:

Probabilities: [28, 57, 15]

Checklist  
1. Rule paraphrased above – correct.  
2. Outside view stated and used as anchor.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = “Doesn’t change”, least = “Decreases” – matches reasoning.  
4. Key evidence: (i) 65 % historical no-change base rate; (ii) 18 Feb value already near baseline; (iii) ±3 threshold small; (iv) Feb 22 birthday mini-spike precedent; (v) retail-sale media coverage persists.  
5. Blind-spot: Unexpected viral political event mentioning “President’s Day” on TikTok or X around 23-25 Feb could lift searches >3, making “Increase” dominant.  
6. Status-quo bias checked – still centre of mass.  
7. Sum = 100, each between 0–100.

Probabilities: [28, 57, 15]
