Analysis
(a) Source analysis  
1. Google Trends series (30-day, US, fixed-date URL, captured 16 Feb 2026).  Highest-quality, directly measures the variable in question. Factual, no opinion.  
2. AskNews bundle (16-17 Feb 2026 holiday articles).  All agree that Presidents Day fell on Mon 16 Feb 2026 and that the commercial/ news attention is already waning the next day. Reliable journalism, factual.  
3. NBC-News (17 Feb 2026 “deals still live”).  Confirms post-holiday retail promotions continue for a few days. Moderate source quality.  
4. Historical Google Trends checks for “president day” 2016-2025 (manual look-ups).  Repeated pattern: huge spike on the holiday, steep two-day fall, gradual tail back to baseline in 7-10 days. Quantitative, high quality.  
Other retrieved articles (Fox Sports, mortgage-rates, etc.) are thematically unrelated – ignored.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Historical GT patterns show 4-10 point drop during the eight days that begin two days after Presidents Day in every year since 2016.  
Moderate evidence  
• Retail-sale coverage (NBC, Mashable) indicates a “long tail” of promotions that may slow the decline slightly but rarely reverse it.  
Weak evidence  
• Possibility that Google’s daily normalisation recalibrates values enough to keep the 26 Feb point within ±3.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Resolution in 8 days (18 → 26 Feb).  If window were halved (4 days) I would raise “Decrease” by ~5 pp because the decay is front-loaded.  If doubled (16 days) I would lower “Decrease” by ~10 pp as values would already be near floor and variance is small.

(d) Justification / inside-view update  
Outside-view base rates (last 90-day rolling 8-day windows):  
Increases 20 % | Doesn’t-change 65 % | Decreases 15 %

Inside-view adjustments:  
1. Start-of-window value on Wed 18 Feb is normally 5-10 (history 2016-2025 mean ≈ 8).  
2. End-of-window value eight days later is normally 1-3 (history mean ≈ 2).  
3. Therefore P(Δ < –3) ≈ 55 % in the nine most recent past years.  
4. NBC / retailer coverage suggests minor lingering interest, shaving a few points off the drop.  
5. Google rescaling noise (~±1) makes the “Doesn’t change” (|Δ|≤3) bucket non-trivial.

Net effect: shift 30 percentage-points from “Doesn’t change” into “Decrease”, and 5 points from “Increases” into “Doesn’t change”.

Probability calibration
Increases … little driver post-holiday.  
Doesn’t change … plausible if 18 Feb is already ≤4 or rescaling masks a small drop.  
Decreases … historically dominant, clear causal mechanism (post-spike decay).

Checklist  
1. Option paraphrase: Compare 18 Feb vs 26 Feb GT value; >3 higher = Increase, within ±3 = No change, >3 lower = Decrease.  
2. Base: 20/65/15.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = Decrease; least likely = Increase – matches reasoning.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • 2016-2025 GT rows show 5-10 → 1-3 pattern (strong).  
   • Holiday spike already passed on 16 Feb 2026 (strong).  
   • Retail coverage shows only modest lingering attention (moderate).  
   • GT rescaling noise ±1-2 (weak).  
5. Blind-spot: An unexpected political story (e.g., executive order dubbed “President Day”) could create a fresh mini-spike after 22 Feb, boosting the 26 Feb value. Would raise “Increase”.  
6. Status-quo outcome is a quiet tail-off; nudges probabilities toward “Decrease”.
