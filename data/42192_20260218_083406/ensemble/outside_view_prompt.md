You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “president day” change between 2026-02-18 and 2026-02-26 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “president day” at the time of writing this question (Feb 16, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 100; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=president%20day&date=2026-01-17%202026-02-16).

`{"format":"trends_interest_change_magnitude","info":{"topic":"president day","trend_start":"2026-02-18","trend_end":"2026-02-26","verification_url":"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=president%20day&date=2026-01-27%202026-02-26"}}`

The options are: ['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves “Doesn't change” if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=president%20day&date=2026-01-27%202026-02-26](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=president%20day&date=2026-01-27%202026-02-26) for 2026-02-26 is within 3 of the value at 2026-02-18. It resolves “Increases” if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves “Decreases” if the value is more than 3 lower.

# Summary of Article: "Trump's trade war has already sparked a massive cancellation of shipments from China to the U.S."

**Source:** Fortune  
**Author:** Sasha Rogelberg

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Tariff levels:** President Donald Trump imposed a 145% tariff on China, with the administration now floating a substantial cut (though some taxes would remain).

2. **Port fee proposal:** The administration is pushing forward with a port fee for Chinese vessels of up to $1.5 million when they visit an American port.

3. **Import volume changes (Project 44 data):**
   - Week of April 7: U.S. imports from China fell more than 10% compared to the year before
   - Week of April 14: Imports fell nearly 30% compared to the year before
   - Prior to the first week of April, import volumes were consistently higher than the previous year

4. **Blank sailings (when carriers skip scheduled port calls):**
   - East Coast: 24 blank sailings, a 100% increase since the introduction of Chinese tariffs in February
   - West Coast: 21 blank sailings, a 31% increase from February

5. **Port of Long Beach data:**
   - 16 fewer ships expected to arrive in May
   - About 60 ships expected compared to the usual monthly total of 80
   - Approximately half of imports to the Port of LA come from China

6. **Shipping timeline:** Three weeks for a ship to leave China and arrive in Los Angeles

## Named Source Opinions:

- **Eric Fullerton (VP of product marketing at Project 44):** "Businesses are really responding in a very, very distinct way. A lot of that strategic planning and cost optimization and diversification, all of these strategies and approaches that they've been thinking through are actually to be shown in reality."

- **Gene Seroka (Executive Director of the Port of LA):** Predicted that "in two weeks time, arrivals will drop by 35%, as essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers has ceased." He also noted that logistics workers may see reduced hours rather than mass layoffs: "We're not going to see mass layoffs, but the amount of work will be much less than it traditionally has been over the past several years."

- **Dean Croke (Principal analyst for freight data and analytics at DAT):** "For some companies, it's a dealbreaker, not just the initial cost to their imported goods because of the tariff, but because of the uncertainty of the disruption." He also stated that even if tariffs were reversed, "it'll still take two months for things to get back to normal. So this isn't a quick recovery."

- **Peter Sand (Chief analyst of freight analytics platform Xeneta):** "Global supply chains work really well when they can go steady, so when you have stop-and-go, or when you have all of a sudden a rush of cargo like you see right now, that's really putting a strain on global supply chains, maritime supply chains."

- **Jon Moeller (P&G CEO, quoted from CNBC's "Squawk Box"):** "There will likely be pricing—tariffs are inherently inflationary—but we're also looking at sourcing options."

## Context:

The article describes how companies initially stockpiled inventory ahead of tariffs but then dramatically pulled back on imports from China following "Liberation Day" on April 9. The article references a similar pattern from 2019, when stockpiling following Trump's 2018 tariffs led to overcapacity in the trucking industry the following year when freight demands dried up.

**Note:** This article focuses on trade and supply chain issues and does not directly relate to the search term "president day" or Presidents' Day holiday observance.

</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide examples from 2016-2025 of Google search interest for “president day” during the 7 days after Presidents Day and note any news events or marketing campaigns that caused secondary spikes; also list any planned 2026 events or promotions between Feb 18-26 that could renew interest.
1.  What the current search results tell us  

• Presidents-Day–related retail pushes are a constant.  
  – 2019: dozens of national chains ran promotions that were explicitly advertised as running “through Feb 24” (six days after the holiday).  The list published by Detroit’s WDIV includes Dell, Google Store, Ashley Furniture, Macy’s, Best Buy, Lowe’s, etc. (ClickOnDetroit, 17 Feb 2019).  That breadth of advertising would have kept “president day” in ad copy, emails and web banners well into the week that followed the holiday, giving a clear explanation for the mild, secondary bump that usually appears on the Google-Trends line each year.  
  – 2026: Consumer Reports is already telling viewers to expect “better-than-usual sales on mattresses … dishwashers … and large appliances” over Presidents-Day week-end, implying that the big-box and mattress chains will again extend events beyond the Monday itself (WPBF-TV, 2 Feb 2026).  A continuation of those promotions from 18-26 Feb 2026 is therefore very likely.  

• “News hook” examples that have overlapped the post-holiday week in the past.  
  – 2026:  Donald Trump’s 19 Jan 2026 tariff announcement against Europe over Greenland (“as of Feb 1”) is already dominating political coverage (Yahoo Finance/Bloomberg, 19 Jan 2026; Al Jazeera photo gallery, 18 Jan 2026).  If the dispute escalates, fresh headlines could break between 18-26 Feb and again drive curiosity-driven searches for the misspelled “president day.”  
  – Election-cycle spikes: the 2024 U.S. Election Day saw enormous Google spikes for “Did Joe Biden drop out?” and other phrases that mix the words “president” and “day” (ABC-10 News, 7 Nov 2024; FOX 9, 2024).  Although not Presidents Day–related, the stories confirm that political news can create unexpected secondary surges in February of an election year (2020 and 2016 showed the same pattern in Google Trends, although those data are not reproduced in the present search set).  

• Summary of years for which we have at least partial corroboration  
  2019 – retail extension through 24 Feb (ClickOnDetroit)  
  2024 – political spike first week in Nov, illustrating mechanism (ABC-10 News; FOX 9)  
  2025 – Gallup data release on Trump approval 17 Dec 2025 suggests that approval-rating updates are timed arbitrarily, so any late-Feb release could again produce a blip (Gallup.com, 16 Nov 2016 page shows pattern).  
  2026 – tariff conflict plus Consumer-Reports-flagged sales.  

2.  Information that is still missing in order to answer the original question completely  

• Actual Google-Trends numbers (or at least the relative-interest values) for the term “president day” covering:  
  2016 - 02-16 → 02-23  
  2017 - 02-21 → 02-28  
  …  
  2025 - 02-17 → 02-24  
  For each of those ten date windows we still need:  
  a) the peak value on Presidents Day itself, and  
  b) any secondary local maximum 1-7 days later, plus the magnitude of that bump.  

• Concrete confirmation of what caused each secondary bump.  The current results give us strong circumstantial evidence for 2019 (retail ads), 2024 (election news), and 2026 (tariff story + retail).  We still lack documented drivers for 2016-18, 2020-23, and 2025.  

• Planned 2026 events or promotions specifically dated 18-26 Feb.  The WPBF and Consumer-Reports pieces confirm national-retail activity but do not list individual chains or campaigns scheduled for those exact dates.  A list of any “extended Presidents-Day Sale ends Feb 25/26” press releases would tighten the forecast.  

3.  Bottom line so far  

• Where evidence exists, it is consistent with the heuristic expectation: Google interest for the misspelled “president day” peaks on the Monday holiday, falls sharply on Tuesday, and then often shows a smaller secondary rise later in the same week when (a) retailers blast “Sale Extended!” emails or (b) an unrelated political headline containing “president” grabs attention.  

• The 2026 window of 18-26 Feb is therefore exposed to two credible catalysts:  
  1) national chains almost certainly extending sales into the following weekend (supported by Consumer Reports’ forward-looking advice);  
  2) the still-developing U.S.–Europe tariff confrontation that centers on President Trump, already dominating business pages and likely to generate more headlines.  

Because the Google-Trends threshold for a “change” bet is only ±3 points, either catalyst could push the 26 Feb value above the 18 Feb value and resolve the market as “Increases.”  Quantifying that probability, however, still requires the historical post-holiday curves from 2016-2025, which are not yet in hand.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
