Disagreement Analysis:

**Disagreement 1: Post-holiday decay magnitude — Will the Feb 18 value drop by more than 3 points by Feb 26?**
- Forecasters 3 and 5 believe "Decreases" is the most likely outcome (48% and 50% respectively), arguing that historical patterns show values dropping from ~8-10 on Feb 18 to ~1-3 by Feb 26, making a >3 point decline likely.
- Forecasters 1, 2, and 4 believe "Doesn't change" is most likely (60%, 70%, 57%), arguing that the value is already near baseline (~9) and floor effects limit further decline, keeping the change within ±3.
- This is the single largest disagreement, responsible for the wide spread between "Decreases" (5-50%) and "Doesn't change" (40-70%).

**Disagreement 2: What is the actual Feb 18 starting value, and how much room is there to fall?**
- Forecasters 1, 2, and 4 assume Feb 18 ≈ 9 and argue that with a floor near 0-5, there's limited room for a >3 point drop (floor effect).
- Forecasters 3 and 5 argue that historical data shows values typically drop from 5-10 to 1-3 in this window, meaning a drop of 4-7 points is common even from low starting values.
- This factual disagreement about historical post-Presidents Day decay patterns directly drives the probability split.

**Disagreement 3: Washington's Birthday (Feb 22) mini-spike effect**
- Forecaster 4 specifically cites a historical mini-spike around Feb 22 (Washington's actual birthday) that could push values up, supporting "Increases" at 28%.
- Other forecasters either don't mention this or discount it. Forecasters 3 and 5 give "Increases" only 8-10%.
- This is a moderate disagreement affecting the Increases probability range (8-35%).
