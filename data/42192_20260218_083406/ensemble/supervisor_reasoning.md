Resolution of Disagreements:

**Disagreement 1 (Post-holiday decay magnitude):** The targeted research from the agent report provides critical historical data that largely resolves this disagreement. The agent directly read Google Trends values for prior years:

- **Presidents Day 2025:** Holiday = 100, 2 days later ≈ 23, 9 days later ≈ 6
- **Presidents Day 2024:** Holiday = 100, 2 days later ≈ 20, 7 days later ≈ 5

This strongly supports forecasters 3 and 5's position. The decay from ~Feb 18 to ~Feb 26 is substantial. If Feb 18 is around 15-23 (based on being 2 days post-holiday) and Feb 26 is around 5-6, the drop is 10-17 points — far exceeding the ±3 threshold. Even in the most conservative scenario, the drop exceeds 3 points.

**However**, there's an important nuance about the resolution URL scaling. The resolution URL uses the window Jan 27 – Feb 26, 2026. In this window, the peak will still be around Feb 16 (the holiday). The relative scaling means Feb 18 might show as ~20 and Feb 26 as ~5, giving a difference of ~15 points. This clearly exceeds 3.

**Disagreement 2 (Starting value and room to fall):** The historical data shows Feb 18 values are typically in the 15-23 range (not 9 as some forecasters assumed based on the current Jan 17-Feb 16 window). The value of 9 cited by forecasters 1 and 2 appears to be from the *current* window ending Feb 16, which may not accurately represent what Feb 18 will show in the *resolution* window (Jan 27-Feb 26). With a starting value of ~15-23, there is ample room to fall more than 3 points to the ~5 level by Feb 26. This undermines the "floor effect" argument of forecasters 1, 2, and 4.

**Disagreement 3 (Washington's Birthday Feb 22 bump):** The second agent report found no evidence of a detectable bump. The historical data from 2024-2025 shows continuous decay through the period with no secondary spike. The Senate tradition of reading Washington's Farewell Address on Feb 22 is noted but is unlikely to generate significant search volume for "president day."

Updated Analysis:

The historical evidence strongly favors "Decreases." In both 2024 and 2025, the Google Trends value for "president day" dropped dramatically between the equivalent of Feb 18 and Feb 26 — by roughly 10-17 points on the 0-100 scale. The ±3 threshold is easily exceeded.

The key error in the "Doesn't change" camp was assuming the Feb 18 value would be ~9 (near floor), based on the current window's scaling. But in the resolution window (Jan 27 – Feb 26), the scaling will be anchored to the holiday peak, and Feb 18 will likely show as ~15-23, while Feb 26 will be ~3-6. The difference is clearly >3.

The only scenarios where "Doesn't change" or "Increases" could occur would be:
- An unexpected viral event or major political news involving "president day" around Feb 22-26
- Unusual Google Trends rescaling artifacts

These are low-probability events.

I'm shifting significantly toward "Decreases" based on the clear historical evidence. Forecasters 3 and 5 were closer to correct.

Confidence: HIGH

Probabilities: [5, 25, 70]
