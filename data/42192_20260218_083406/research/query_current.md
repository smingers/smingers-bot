Analysis:
The core driver of Google Trends values for “president day” is the U.S. federal holiday (Presidents Day), which in 2026 fell on Monday 16 Feb. Search interest historically peaks on (or just before) the holiday as people look up its date, history, store hours, sales, etc., then drops sharply afterward. To judge whether interest will stay roughly the same, rise, or fall between 18 Feb and 26 Feb 2026, I need:  
• Recent Google Trends snapshots or commentary showing how quickly interest decays after the holiday in prior years.  
• Any 2026-specific factors (e.g., extended retailer promotions, major news tied to the holiday, or political events referencing Presidents Day) that could keep searches elevated through late February.  
Current news about Presidents-Day-related retail campaigns, travel spikes, school calendars, or political controversies could signal a slower decline or even a rebound in search activity. Therefore, queries will target: (1) Google Trends data mentions, (2) news coverage of Presidents Day 2026 search/online behavior, and (3) expert analysis or forecasts of post-holiday interest.
