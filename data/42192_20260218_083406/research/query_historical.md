Analysis:
The question hinges on whether search interest for “president day” fades after the U-S Presidents Day holiday (Feb 16 2026) or stays flat/recovers by Feb 26.  Historically, Google Trends for holiday-related terms shows a sharp spike on the holiday itself followed by a quick decay over the next 7-10 days unless a fresh news hook (e.g., a controversy, a retail promotion campaign, or a presidential proclamation) reignites attention.  To build an outside view, I need:
• Past-years Google Trends curves for “president day” around mid-February  
• Examples of any years where interest rose again the week after the holiday and why  
• Recent news or scheduled events (sales, political actions, commemorations) that might lift interest between Feb 18-26 2026.

3. Provide examples from 2016-2025 of Google search interest for “president day” during the 7 days after Presidents Day and note any news events or marketing campaigns that caused secondary spikes; also list any planned 2026 events or promotions between Feb 18-26 that could renew interest. (Agent)
