Bush Torches Trump in Presidents\u2019 Day Message \u2013 Ya Libnan**\nFormer U.S. President George W. Bush delivered a Presidents\u2019 Day essay that subtly criticized Donald Trump by highlighting qualities of George Washington that are currently lacking in contemporary leadership. Bush emphasized Washington\u2019s humility, reverence for history and superior knowledge, self-restraint in power, and willingness to step down after two terms\u2014choices that prevented America from becoming a monarchy. Bush noted that Washington\u2019s decisions to relinquish power twice set a lasting standard for presidential conduct. The message carried implicit weight given Trump\u2019s repeated challenges to election results, his 2020 election denial, and his public interest in running for a third term despite legal constraints. Bush underscored Washington\u2019s role in shaping both the character of the presidency and the nation, stating he \u2018embodied integrity\u2019 and \u2018put the good of the nation over self-interest.\u2019\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 01:38 AM\nSource:[yalibnan.com](https://yalibnan.com/2026/02/17/george-w-bush-torches-trump-in-presidents-day-message/)\n\n**Monday is Presidents Day**\nMonday, February 16, 2026, marks Presidents Day in the United States, commemorating George Washington's birthday, traditionally observed on February 22.

With this measure, federal agencies will remain closed from Wednesday, December 24, through Friday, December 26, as December 25 (Christmas Day) is already a recognized national holiday. The order allows agency heads to determine which offices or facilities must remain open and which employees must work, stating that 'some essential services must remain active, but the majority of federal employees will be able to enjoy a well-deserved family break during Christmas.' Trump had previously designated Christmas Eve as a federal holiday in 2019 and 2020 during his first term. In 2014, President Barack Obama declared December 26 a federal holiday when it fell on a Friday. In May 2025, Trump also declared May 8 and May 11 as national holidays to commemorate Allied victories in World War I and World War II, respectively, with the May 11 observance being an additional commemorative designation that did not change the official name of Veterans Day (November 11).

This means federal employees will have a three-day holiday from December 24 to 26, with most non-essential departments closed. While past U.S. presidents have previously designated one day around Christmas as a holiday, Trump\u2019s move to make both December 24 and 26 holidays is considered unusual. The decision comes amid declining presidential approval ratings due to high inflation and economic concerns. According to Axios, the move may be part of a broader strategy of 'populist policies' aimed at boosting public approval ahead of the November 2026 midterm elections. In a prior speech, Trump announced a $1,776 Christmas bonus for 1.45 million military personnel and pledged to appoint a Federal Reserve chair who supports aggressive interest rate cuts, promising reduced mortgage burdens starting early next year.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: December 18, 2025 11:50 PM\nSource:[KBS](https://news.kbs.co.kr/news/pc/view/view.do?ncd=8437751)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
