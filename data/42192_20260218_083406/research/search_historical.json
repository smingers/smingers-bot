Google trends show what Houstionians are asking\"\n\n**Source:** KPRC  \n**Date:** February 16, 2026  \n**Author:** Zorrie Jones\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Google Search Volume on Presidents Day (Monday, February 16, 2026):**\n   - Nationwide: More than 200,000 searches focused on Presidents Day-related questions\n   - Texas: 20,000 searches\n   - Houston: About 2,000 searches\n\n2. **Traffic Observation:** The article notes that Houstonians experienced lighter traffic than usual on Monday, February 16, 2026.\n\n3. **Search Topics:** Americans were searching about various aspects of Presidents Day, including:\n   - Mail delivery status\n   - Stock market operations\n   - School closures\n   - Bank hours\n   - What offices and businesses were open or closed\n\n4. **Local Context:** The article indicates that many offices and schools were closed on this day, leading to confusion among residents about what services were available.\n\n## Context:\n\nThe article describes a situation where many people in Houston and across the U.S. were uncertain whether Presidents Day was a federal holiday and what services would be affected, prompting significant search activity on Google on February 16, 2026 (the Monday of Presidents Day).\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://mashable.com/article/presidential-lives-gallery-google-arts\">\n## Summary of Article\n\n**Source:** Mashable  \n**Date:** February 15, 2017\n\n### Key Facts:\n\n1. **Google Arts and Culture Partnership:** Google Arts and Culture partnered with U.S. institutions, libraries, and museums to deliver presidential media content for Presidents' Day.\n\n2. **Content Available:** The platform features various exhibits including:\n   - Significant events in the path toward American democracy\n   - Gallery of presidential pets\n   - The Bush family's favorite taco recipe (handwritten by Barbara Bush, contains Doritos)\n   - Thomas Jefferson's life journey from boyhood to manhood\n   - 360-degree videos including the Air Force Pavilion at the Ronald Reagan Library\n\n3. **Presidential Pet Example:** Theodore Roosevelt kept a lion cub, a bear, an antelope, a wallaby, and a bobcat in the White House, alongside dogs and cats.\n\n4. **Virtual Tours:** The Google Arts and Culture app (available on iOS and Android) offers virtual tours of sites like Mount Rushmore and the Lincoln Memorial.\n\n### Relevance to Forecasting Question:\n\nThis article from 2017 demonstrates that Google has historically promoted presidential content around Presidents' Day through its Arts and Culture platform, which could potentially influence search behavior for terms like \"president day\" during the Presidents' Day period. However, this article is from 2017 and may not reflect current promotional activities for 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.brookings.edu/articles/what-internet-search-data-reveal-about-donald-trumps-first-year-in-office/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"What internet search data reveals about Donald Trump's first year in office\"\n\n**Source:** Brookings  \n**Date:** February 10, 2026  \n**Author:** Stephanie K.

A lot of that strategic planning and cost optimization and diversification, all of these strategies and approaches that they've been thinking through are actually to be shown in reality.\"\n\n- **Gene Seroka (Executive Director of the Port of LA):** Predicted that \"in two weeks time, arrivals will drop by 35%, as essentially all shipments out of China for major retailers and manufacturers has ceased.\" He also noted that logistics workers may see reduced hours rather than mass layoffs: \"We're not going to see mass layoffs, but the amount of work will be much less than it traditionally has been over the past several years.\"\n\n- **Dean Croke (Principal analyst for freight data and analytics at DAT):** \"For some companies, it's a dealbreaker, not just the initial cost to their imported goods because of the tariff, but because of the uncertainty of the disruption.\" He also stated that even if tariffs were reversed, \"it'll still take two months for things to get back to normal. So this isn't a quick recovery.\"\n\n- **Peter Sand (Chief analyst of freight analytics platform Xeneta):** \"Global supply chains work really well when they can go steady, so when you have stop-and-go, or when you have all of a sudden a rush of cargo like you see right now, that's really putting a strain on global supply chains, maritime supply chains.\"\n\n- **Jon Moeller (P&G CEO, quoted from CNBC's \"Squawk Box\"):** \"There will likely be pricing\u2014tariffs are inherently inflationary\u2014but we're also looking at sourcing options.\"\n\n## Context:\n\nThe article describes how companies initially stockpiled inventory ahead of tariffs but then dramatically pulled back on imports from China following \"Liberation Day\" on April 9. The article references a similar pattern from 2019, when stockpiling following Trump's 2018 tariffs led to overcapacity in the trucking industry the following year when freight demands dried up.\n\n**Note:** This article focuses on trade and supply chain issues and does not directly relate to the search term \"president day\" or Presidents' Day holiday observance.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://theweek.com/politics/barack-obama-net-worth-explained\">\n# Summary of Article: \"What is Barack Obama's net worth?\"\n\n**Source:** The Week  \n**Date:** March 14, 2025  \n**Author:** David Faris\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Net Worth Estimates:**\n   - New York Post (2018): $135 million (no methodology provided)\n   - Forbes (September 2024): $70 million\n   - Fortune (January 2017, when leaving White House): $12.2 million\n\n2. **Income Sources:**\n   - Presidential salary: $400,000 per year during eight years as president\n   - Senate salary: $162,100 (2006) to $169,300 (2009)\n   - Book royalties: $15.6 million between 2009 and 2017\n   - Speaker fees from public engagements\n   - Production company deals (Higher Ground)\n   - Real estate holdings\n\n3. **Real Estate Holdings:**\n   - Washington, D.C. home: purchased for $8.1 million in 2017\n   - Chicago Hyde Park residence: purchased in 2005\n   - Martha's Vineyard estate: purchased for $11.75 million in 2019\n\n4. **Higher Ground Productions:**\n   - Produces scripted and unscripted television and movies\n   - Examples include \"Waffles and Mochi\" and \"Leave the World Behind\" (2023)\n   - 2022: Signed with Creative Artists Agency (CAA)\n   - 2022: Signed deal with Amazon's Audible for audio projects\n   - Produces podcasts including \"IMO With Michelle Obama and Craig Robinson\" (debuted 2025)\n   - Revenue from Higher Ground is unknown\n\n5. **Market Context:**\n   - Article notes the Obamas' portfolio likely fluctuated following President Trump's \"Liberation Day\" tariff announcements on April 2, 2025\n   - Obama predicted tariffs would have negative impact but was more concerned with White House's infringement of rights (according to CNN)\n\n**Note:** This article does not contain information directly relevant to the forecasting question about Google Trends interest in \"president day\" between February 18-26, 2026.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide examples from 2016-2025 of Google search interest for \u201cpresident day\u201d during the 7 days after Presidents Day and note any news events or marketing campaigns that caused secondary spikes; also list any planned 2026 events or promotions between Feb 18-26 that could renew interest.\n1.  What the current search results tell us  \n\n\u2022 Presidents-Day\u2013related retail pushes are a constant.  \n  \u2013 2019: dozens of national chains ran promotions that were explicitly advertised as running \u201cthrough Feb 24\u201d (six days after the holiday).  The list published by Detroit\u2019s WDIV includes Dell, Google Store, Ashley Furniture, Macy\u2019s, Best Buy, Lowe\u2019s, etc. (ClickOnDetroit, 17 Feb 2019).  That breadth of advertising would have kept \u201cpresident day\u201d in ad copy, emails and web banners well into the week that followed the holiday, giving a clear explanation for the mild, secondary bump that usually appears on the Google-Trends line each year.  \n  \u2013 2026: Consumer Reports is already telling viewers to expect \u201cbetter-than-usual sales on mattresses \u2026 dishwashers \u2026 and large appliances\u201d over Presidents-Day week-end, implying that the big-box and mattress chains will again extend events beyond the Monday itself (WPBF-TV, 2 Feb 2026).  A continuation of those promotions from 18-26 Feb 2026 is therefore very likely.  \n\n\u2022 \u201cNews hook\u201d examples that have overlapped the post-holiday week in the past.  \n  \u2013 2026:  Donald Trump\u2019s 19 Jan 2026 tariff announcement against Europe over Greenland (\u201cas of Feb 1\u201d) is already dominating political coverage (Yahoo Finance/Bloomberg, 19 Jan 2026; Al Jazeera photo gallery, 18 Jan 2026).  If the dispute escalates, fresh headlines could break between 18-26 Feb and again drive curiosity-driven searches for the misspelled \u201cpresident day.\u201d  \n  \u2013 Election-cycle spikes: the 2024 U.S. Election Day saw enormous Google spikes for \u201cDid Joe Biden drop out?\u201d and other phrases that mix the words \u201cpresident\u201d and \u201cday\u201d (ABC-10 News, 7 Nov 2024; FOX 9, 2024).  Although not Presidents Day\u2013related, the stories confirm that political news can create unexpected secondary surges in February of an election year (2020 and 2016 showed the same pattern in Google Trends, although those data are not reproduced in the present search set).  \n\n\u2022 Summary of years for which we have at least partial corroboration  \n  2019 \u2013 retail extension through 24 Feb (ClickOnDetroit)  \n  2024 \u2013 political spike first week in Nov, illustrating mechanism (ABC-10 News; FOX 9)  \n  2025 \u2013 Gallup data release on Trump approval 17 Dec 2025 suggests that approval-rating updates are timed arbitrarily, so any late-Feb release could again produce a blip (Gallup.com, 16 Nov 2016 page shows pattern).  \n  2026 \u2013 tariff conflict plus Consumer-Reports-flagged sales.  \n\n2.  Information that is still missing in order to answer the original question completely  \n\n\u2022 Actual Google-Trends numbers (or at least the relative-interest values) for the term \u201cpresident day\u201d covering:  \n  2016 - 02-16 \u2192 02-23  \n  2017 - 02-21 \u2192 02-28  \n  \u2026  \n  2025 - 02-17 \u2192 02-24  \n  For each of those ten date windows we still need:  \n  a) the peak value on Presidents Day itself, and  \n  b) any secondary local maximum 1-7 days later, plus the magnitude of that bump.  \n\n\u2022 Concrete confirmation of what caused each secondary bump.  The current results give us strong circumstantial evidence for 2019 (retail ads), 2024 (election news), and 2026 (tariff story + retail).  We still lack documented drivers for 2016-18, 2020-23, and 2025.  \n\n\u2022 Planned 2026 events or promotions specifically dated 18-26 Feb.  The WPBF and Consumer-Reports pieces confirm national-retail activity but do not list individual chains or campaigns scheduled for those exact dates.  A list of any \u201cextended Presidents-Day Sale ends Feb 25/26\u201d press releases would tighten the forecast.  \n\n3.  Bottom line so far  \n\n\u2022 Where evidence exists, it is consistent with the heuristic expectation: Google interest for the misspelled \u201cpresident day\u201d peaks on the Monday holiday, falls sharply on Tuesday, and then often shows a smaller secondary rise later in the same week when (a) retailers blast \u201cSale Extended!\u201d emails or (b) an unrelated political headline containing \u201cpresident\u201d grabs attention.  \n\n\u2022 The 2026 window of 18-26 Feb is therefore exposed to two credible catalysts:  \n  1) national chains almost certainly extending sales into the following weekend (supported by Consumer Reports\u2019 forward-looking advice);  \n  2) the still-developing U.S.\u2013Europe tariff confrontation that centers on President Trump, already dominating business pages and likely to generate more headlines.  \n\nBecause the Google-Trends threshold for a \u201cchange\u201d bet is only \u00b13 points, either catalyst could push the 26 Feb value above the 18 Feb value and resolve the market as \u201cIncreases.\u201d  Quantifying that probability, however, still requires the historical post-holiday curves from 2016-2025, which are not yet in hand.</Agent_report>\n\n<GoogleTrendsData term=\"president day\">\nGoogle Trends US data for \"president day\" (last 90 days):\n\nCurrent value: 9\n90-day mean: 9.3\n90-day std dev: 11.1\n\nBASE RATE ANALYSIS (using 8-day windows to match question timeframe):\n- In 65% of 8-day windows, the value changed by \u22643 points (\"Doesn't change\")\n- In 24% of 8-day windows, the value INCREASED by >3 points\n- In 11% of 8-day windows, the value DECREASED by >3 points\n\nRecent trend: increasing (last 7 days avg: 33.9 vs prior 7 days: 13.0)\n\nDAILY VALUES (last 30 days):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-20,12\n2026-01-21,10\n2026-01-22,8\n2026-01-23,8\n2026-01-24,6\n2026-01-25,9\n2026-01-26,13\n2026-01-27,8\n2026-01-28,8\n2026-01-29,9\n2026-01-30,9\n2026-01-31,7\n2026-02-01,10\n2026-02-02,13\n2026-02-03,13\n2026-02-04,9\n2026-02-05,11\n2026-02-06,11\n2026-02-07,10\n2026-02-08,12\n2026-02-09,17\n2026-02-10,15\n2026-02-11,15\n2026-02-12,20\n2026-02-13,24\n2026-02-14,23\n2026-02-15,41\n2026-02-16,100\n2026-02-17,20\n2026-02-18,9\n\nNote: Google Trends values are relative (0-100 scale), not absolute search volumes.\n</GoogleTrendsData>\n"
