Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Recent High-Quality Sources (February 2026):**

1. **BBC (Feb 10, 2026)** - Gold-standard UK news. Reports three potential crisis moments: Mandelson documents (timing unclear), Gorton/Denton by-election (Feb 26), and May 7 elections. Expert Tim Bale (Queen Mary University) provides factual assessment that Starmer "appears to have calmed some nerves for the time being" and "may be in Number 10 for a while yet." Key fact: No easy mechanism to remove Labour leader quickly.

2. **Hyphen (Feb 11, 2026)** - ITV correspondent Shehab Khan reports PLP meeting where Starmer was "animated, forceful and at times combative." Factual: Critics have "gone quiet" for now. One Labour MP quoted: Starmer has "potentially bought himself some time, but maybe only a few weeks."

3. **Al Jazeera (Feb 10, 2026)** - Reports leadership challenge averted, cabinet rallied. Expert Tim Bale: Starmer "managed so far to hold on to his cabinet" but "completely lost the trust of the electorate."

4. **YouGov (Feb 2026)** - Reliable polling data showing Labour at 21% nationally, Reform UK leading most polls since April 2025.

5. **The Times (Feb 16, 2026)** - Data journalism piece. Factual: Starmer's approval at -50%, 55% of 2024 Labour voters now unfavorable. Historical comparison: Tony Blair had +44% at same point.

6. **Guardian (Feb 4, 2026)** - George Monbiot opinion piece citing British Social Attitudes survey (60% want electoral reform) and October analysis suggesting Reform UK could win 48% of seats on 27% vote share.

**AskNews Articles (Feb 16-18, 2026):**

7. **Birmingham Live (Feb 18)** - Reports Starmer defended local elections U-turn, citing "further legal advice" after Reform UK legal challenge.

8. **Mirror (Feb 18)** - Reports Starmer speech in Cardiff defending economic record: inflation down to 3%, interest rates cut six times.

9. **Express (Feb 17)** - Reports unnamed bank (Jefferies implied) predicts Starmer removal, but includes Starmer's direct quote reaffirming commitment to lead Labour into next election.

10. **Multiple sources (Feb 16-17)** - Confirm government reversed plan to delay 30 local elections after Reform UK legal challenge, will now pay their legal costs.

**Older Sources:**
11. **Breitbart (Jan 4, 2026)** - Reports Starmer stated he'll be in office by 2027. Cites MRP poll showing Reform UK projected to win 381 seats.

12. **Russian sources (Nov 2025)** - Low reliability, speculative predictions about resignation.

**Key Factual Observations:**
- Current date: Feb 18, 2026
- Resolution date: Feb 25, 2026 (7 days away)
- Current community prediction: 60.00% (exactly at threshold)
- Recent crisis (Feb 5-10) was weathered; leadership challenge failed
- Next major event: Feb 26 by-election (AFTER resolution date)
- Multiple sources confirm Starmer has "bought time" but remains vulnerable

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- Multiple reliable sources (BBC, Al Jazeera, Hyphen) confirm leadership challenge failed and Starmer stabilized position (Feb 10-11)
- Structural factor: Labour leadership rules require 80+ MPs to trigger contest; recent attempt failed to gather support
- Expert consensus (Tim Bale, multiple quotes): Starmer has "bought time" but faces vulnerability at May elections
- Factual: Next major electoral test (Feb 26) occurs AFTER our resolution date

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Recent government U-turn on local elections (Feb 16-17) could trigger negative sentiment shift
- Starmer's own statements (Feb 18) defending position suggest active damage control
- Historical pattern: UK PM approval ratings rarely recover from -50% levels
- Current polling shows Labour at 21%, down from 34% in 2024

**Weak Evidence:**
- Unnamed bank prediction (Express article) - lacks specific methodology
- Russian sources from November - speculative and outdated
- General "mood" reporting without specific catalysts

**Critical Insight:** This question asks about FORECASTER BEHAVIOR (will community prediction rise above 60%?), not about the actual event (will Starmer cease to be PM?). The evidence must be weighted by how it would affect forecaster updates in the next 7 days.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 7 days (Feb 18 → Feb 25, 2026)

**Current Trajectory:** The community prediction reached 60% after the Feb 5-10 crisis and subsequent Feb 16-17 U-turn. It has stabilized at exactly 60%.

**If Timeframe Halved (3.5 days):** Would predict ~20-22% chance of rising above 60%, as even less time for new catalysts to emerge.

**If Timeframe Doubled (14 days):** Would predict ~35-40% chance, as this would include the Feb 26 by-election result, which could trigger significant forecaster updates.

**Key Temporal Factor:** The Feb 26 by-election is the next major catalyst, but it occurs AFTER our resolution date. Pre-election polling could influence forecasters, but typically final polls emerge only 2-3 days before voting, meaning they'd arrive around Feb 23-24.

## (d) Justification

**Outside View Base Rate:** 27% (established from reference class of Metaculus predictions near threshold with short time horizons)

**Factors Supporting Increase Above 60%:**
1. Recent U-turn (Feb 16-17) demonstrates continued government instability
2. Pre-by-election polling could emerge showing Labour disaster
3. Any new Mandelson-related revelations
4. Economic data releases

**Factors Supporting Decrease or Stability:**
1. Leadership challenge already failed (Feb 10) - immediate threat passed
2. Expert consensus: Starmer has "bought time" until May
3. No obvious catalysts in next 7 days before Feb 26 by-election
4. Forecaster psychology: After failed challenge, tendency to lower probabilities
5. Structural: Prediction sitting exactly at 60% suggests equilibrium

**Shift Justification:**
The outside view of 27% should be adjusted upward slightly because:
- The recent U-turn (Feb 16-17) is very fresh and may not be fully priced into the 60% prediction yet
- Multiple sources confirm ongoing instability despite immediate crisis passing
- The threshold being exactly 60.00% suggests it could easily move in either direction with minor news

However, the adjustment should be modest because:
- The major crisis (Feb 5-10) has already been incorporated
- No clear near-term catalysts before Feb 25
- Expert consensus points to May elections as the critical moment, not February

**Calibrated Assessment:** The evidence suggests a 30-35% probability that the community prediction will rise above 60% by Feb 25. The recent U-turn provides some upward pressure, but the lack of immediate catalysts and the failed leadership challenge provide downward pressure.

Probability calibration:

Starting from outside view of 27%, I adjust upward to 32% based on:
- Very recent U-turn (Feb 16-17) may not be fully incorporated yet (+3%)
- Possibility of pre-by-election polling emerging Feb 23-24 (+2%)

I do not adjust further because:
- Leadership challenge already failed and incorporated
- Expert consensus points to May, not February, as critical period
- Structural factors (80 MP threshold) remain unchanged
- Forecaster behavior typically shows mean reversion after failed challenges

32% represents roughly 1-in-3 odds that new negative information emerges in the next 7 days sufficient to push the community prediction above 60%.

---

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Metaculus community prediction for "Starmer ceases to be PM in 2026" exceed 60% on Feb 25, 2026? Currently at exactly 60%.

2. **Base rate:** 27% from outside view. Final prediction 32% represents modest upward adjustment based on very recent U-turn and potential for pre-by-election polling.

3. **Consistency:** "32 out of 100 times, the community prediction rises above 60% by Feb 25." This aligns with roughly 1-in-3 odds that new negative catalysts emerge in next 7 days.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Leadership challenge failed Feb 10; immediate threat passed (factual, multiple sources)
   - Government U-turned on elections Feb 16-17; demonstrates instability (factual, multiple sources)
   - Expert consensus: Starmer "bought time" until May (Tim Bale, identifiable expert)
   - Feb 26 by-election occurs AFTER resolution date (factual, structural)
   - Prediction currently at exactly 60%, suggesting equilibrium (factual, from question)

5. **Blind spot:** Pre-by-election polling showing catastrophic Labour collapse emerges Feb 23-24, triggering rapid forecaster updates. This could push probability to 50-55%.

6. **Status quo:** Current 60% prediction represents post-crisis equilibrium. Absent new catalysts, slight downward drift is more likely than upward. However, very recent U-turn (48 hours old) provides modest upward pressure. Status quo outcome (staying at or below 60%) is more probable at 68%.

Probability: 32%
