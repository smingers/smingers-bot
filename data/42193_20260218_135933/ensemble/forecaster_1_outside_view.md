## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles (February 2026):**

1. **CNBC (Feb 10, 2026)** - High-quality financial news source. Reports bond market reactions to political instability, with named expert quotes from Jordan Rochester (Mizuho), Kallum Pickering (Peel Hunt), and Charlie Lloyd (Shackleton Advisers). Key fact: Starmer facing resignation calls over Mandelson-Epstein scandal. Expert opinion (Pickering): predicts Starmer will "squeeze through."

2. **Al Jazeera (Feb 10, 2026)** - Reputable international news. Reports leadership challenge was averted ("coup that never was"). Key facts: Scottish Labour leader Anas Sarwar called for resignation Monday; cabinet rallied around Starmer; multiple resignations (McSweeney, Allan). Expert opinion (Tim Bale, Queen Mary University): Starmer "bought himself some time" but faces "shellacking" in May elections, difficult to continue "much beyond this summer."

3. **PBS (Feb 10, 2026)** - High-quality US public broadcaster. Confirms leadership challenge averted but authority damaged. Key facts: Mandelson fired, police investigation launched, upcoming electoral tests (Feb 26 by-election, May elections). Expert opinion (Tim Bale): Starmer has "bought himself some time" but challengers "keeping their powder dry."

4. **ABC Australia (Feb 6, 2026)** - Reputable source. Reports police raids on Mandelson properties. Expert opinion (Prof. Clement Macintyre, University of Adelaide): "Starmer's time as prime minister is limited. The only doubt is how soon."

5. **BBC (Feb 5, 2026)** - Gold-standard UK news source. Reports Welsh Labour MP calling for resignation; Starmer apologized, said Mandelson lied. Opposition leaders (Farage, Badenoch) calling position "untenable."

**Historical Articles (2025):**

6. **BBC (Summer 2025)** - Andy Burnham contacted by MPs about leadership challenge; would need 80 MPs to trigger contest; previously failed in two leadership campaigns.

7. **BBC (Nov 12, 2025)** - Wes Streeting denies plotting; needs 80-81 nominations (20% of Labour MPs) to trigger contest. Various ministers quoted on timing concerns around local elections.

**Agent Report:**
Provides useful context that community prediction currently stands at 60% (as of Feb 16, 2026). Notes major political events: November 2025 leadership speculation, December polling showing Labour at 25%, February 2026 local election U-turn. However, lacks precise time-series data.

**Key Factual Observations:**
- Current date: Feb 18, 2026
- Resolution date: Feb 25, 2026 (7 days away)
- Current community prediction: 60.00% (the exact threshold)
- Recent crisis (Mandelson-Epstein) peaked ~Feb 5-10, 2026
- Leadership challenge was attempted but failed (cabinet rallied around Starmer)
- Upcoming electoral tests: Feb 26 by-election, May 2026 local elections
- Multiple expert opinions suggest Starmer vulnerable but has "bought time"

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **UK Prime Ministers facing mid-term crises (2010-2026):** Theresa May survived confidence votes but eventually resigned; Boris Johnson survived initial scandals but fell after cumulative damage; Liz Truss fell quickly. This class suggests leaders can survive immediate crises but face delayed consequences.

2. **Metaculus community predictions near threshold values with short time horizons:** When a prediction sits exactly at a resolution threshold with only 7 days remaining, small movements are common but large swings (>10%) are rare without major new information.

3. **Labour leadership challenges (historical):** Labour has mechanisms requiring 20% of MPs (currently 80-81) to trigger contests. The recent attempt failed to gather this support, suggesting current threshold not met.

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** The immediate reference class is "Metaculus community predictions near exact threshold values with 7-day time horizons." The question asks whether the community prediction will rise above 60% by Feb 25, not whether Starmer will actually cease to be PM. This is a meta-prediction about forecaster behavior.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 7 days (Feb 18 → Feb 25, 2026)

**Key Timeline Factors:**
- The Mandelson crisis peaked Feb 5-10, with leadership challenge averted by Feb 10
- Current prediction (60%) represents post-crisis equilibrium
- Next major event: Feb 26 by-election (1 day AFTER our resolution date)
- May 2026 local elections are 2.5+ months away

**Pattern Analysis:**
The community prediction reached 60% after the February crisis but stabilized there. For it to rise above 60% in the next 7 days would require:
- New negative information about Starmer
- Renewed leadership challenge signals
- Dramatic polling/electoral news

The Feb 26 by-election occurs AFTER our resolution date, so its result won't directly affect the Feb 25 community prediction, though pre-election polling might.

## (d) Justification

The current 60% community prediction reflects a post-crisis equilibrium. The Mandelson scandal triggered a leadership challenge that failed (Feb 10). Expert consensus is that Starmer has "bought time" but remains vulnerable to May election results.

For the community prediction to rise above 60% by Feb 25 requires new negative catalysts in the next 7 days. However:

1. **Crisis momentum has stalled:** The leadership challenge failed; cabinet united behind Starmer
2. **No immediate triggers:** The Feb 26 by-election is after our resolution date
3. **Forecaster psychology:** After a failed challenge, forecasters typically lower probabilities until new information emerges
4. **Threshold effect:** The prediction sitting exactly at 60% suggests equilibrium; random walk is as likely down as up

Counter-factors supporting increase above 60%:
1. **Pre-by-election polling:** Bad polling before Feb 26 could shift sentiment
2. **New revelations:** Additional Mandelson/Epstein information
3. **Economic news:** Negative economic data could compound pressure

The base rate for Metaculus predictions moving >0% from exact threshold values in 7-day windows is difficult to establish precisely, but movements of 5-10% are more common than movements of 0-1%.

Outside view calibration:

The question asks whether the community prediction will be HIGHER than 60.00% on Feb 25. This is a binary threshold question about a continuous variable currently sitting exactly at the threshold.

**Calibration factors:**

1. **Current equilibrium:** The 60% represents post-crisis stabilization. Absent new information, predictions tend toward mean reversion or small random walks.

2. **Directional bias:** After a failed leadership challenge, the natural tendency is slight downward revision as the immediate threat recedes. However, underlying fundamentals (poor polling, upcoming elections) support continued high probability.

3. **Time decay:** With 7 days remaining and the next major event (by-election) occurring after resolution, there's limited catalyst potential.

4. **Threshold precision:** The prediction being exactly at 60.00% is notable. This could represent either: (a) genuine equilibrium, or (b) a "round number" psychological anchor that will break with any new information.

5. **Historical upset rate:** In UK politics 2020-2026, unexpected developments occur frequently. However, for THIS specific question (about forecaster behavior, not actual events), the upset rate is about whether forecasters will update significantly in 7 days.

**Tethering to sources:** 
- Expert opinions (Bale, Macintyre) suggest Starmer vulnerable but has "bought time"
- No sources suggest imminent crisis in next 7 days
- Agent report shows prediction climbed to 60% after Feb 17 U-turn, suggesting recent peak

**Probability assessment:**
Given the prediction sits exactly at threshold with 7 days remaining and no obvious near-term catalysts, I assess:
- 40% chance it stays at exactly 60% (no resolution, as ≤60% means No)
- 35% chance it drops below 60% (mean reversion after failed challenge)
- 25% chance it rises above 60% (new negative information or pre-by-election polling)

However, Metaculus predictions rarely stay exactly constant. If forced to choose between above/below, the slight edge goes to downward movement given the failed challenge and lack of immediate catalysts.
