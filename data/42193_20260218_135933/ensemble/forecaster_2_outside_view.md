**Agent Report:**
Provides time-series context showing community prediction evolved from ~25-30% (mid-2025) → low 40s (Nov 2025) → above 50% (Dec 2025) → 60% (Feb 2026). Links moves to specific political events. Quality assessment: Reasonable inference from available data, though acknowledges lack of precise daily values.

**Key Factual Consensus:**
- Current CP: 60% (as of Feb 16, 2026)
- Starmer survived immediate Feb 10 crisis
- Major electoral tests: Feb 26 by-election, May 2026 local elections
- Multiple expert assessments predict difficulties ahead but survival through short-term

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **UK PMs facing leadership challenges mid-term** - Historical examples: Thatcher (1990), Major (1995), May (2019). Suitability: Moderate - these typically occur after longer periods in office.

2. **Labour PMs in second year of government** - Blair (1998-99), Wilson (1965-66). Suitability: Limited - both were more popular and faced different circumstances.

3. **Metaculus community predictions at exactly 60% with 7 days remaining** - This is the most directly relevant reference class. When a binary prediction sits at a precise threshold with short time remaining, the question becomes: what's the probability it moves above vs. stays at/below that threshold?

4. **Political prediction markets near key thresholds** - Studies show predictions near 50% exhibit high volatility, but at 60% there's already directional consensus with meaningful uncertainty.

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** Metaculus predictions at threshold values with short timeframes. The question asks whether CP will be >60% on Feb 25, and it's currently exactly 60% on Feb 18. This is fundamentally a question about near-term prediction dynamics rather than the underlying political outcome.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 7 days (Feb 18 → Feb 25, 2026)

**Key Events in Window:**
- Feb 26: Critical by-election (one day after resolution date)
- Feb 18-25: Pre-election polling and news flow

**Historical Pattern from Agent Report:**
The CP has been on an upward trajectory: 25-30% (mid-2025) → 40s% (Nov) → 50%+ (Dec) → 60% (Feb). This shows momentum toward higher probabilities, driven by accumulating negative news.

**Recent Stability (Feb 10-18):**
Despite the Feb 10 crisis, Starmer survived and cabinet rallied. The CP has remained at 60% for at least 2 days (Feb 16 snapshot). This suggests some stabilization after the immediate crisis.

## (d) Justification

**Factors Favoring CP Rising Above 60%:**
1. **Momentum**: The trend has been consistently upward for months
2. **Pre-election jitters**: The Feb 26 by-election approaches, and negative polling/news could push forecasters higher
3. **Expert consensus**: Multiple named experts (Bale, Macintyre) predict Starmer won't last beyond summer, suggesting underlying fundamentals support higher probabilities
4. **May elections looming**: Forecasters may increasingly price in post-May leadership challenge risk

**Factors Favoring CP Staying ≤60%:**
1. **Recent stabilization**: Starmer survived the Feb 10 crisis; cabinet united behind him
2. **Threshold psychology**: 60% represents a psychological barrier; forecasters may hesitate to push meaningfully higher without new catalysts
3. **Time decay**: Only 7 days remain; absent major news, inertia favors stability
4. **By-election timing**: The Feb 26 by-election occurs AFTER the resolution date, so results won't directly impact the CP on Feb 25
5. **Base rate of PM departures**: Even unpopular PMs typically survive their second year in office

**Critical Insight**: The question resolves on Feb 25, but the by-election is Feb 26. Pre-election polling could move the CP, but the actual result won't be known. This creates an information gap that may limit movement.

Outside view calibration:

The current CP is exactly 60.00%, creating a knife-edge situation. The question is whether it moves up or stays flat/declines over 7 days.

**Anchoring to Available Data:**
- Agent report shows recent upward momentum
- Multiple sources confirm Starmer survived immediate crisis (Feb 10)
- Expert opinions suggest long-term vulnerability but short-term survival
- No major scheduled events between Feb 18-25 except pre-election polling

**Probability Calibration:**
Given:
1. The CP has been stable at 60% for at least 2 days post-crisis
2. The upward trend could continue with negative pre-election polling
3. But absent a major new scandal, dramatic movement is unlikely in 7 days
4. Threshold effects at round numbers (60%) create resistance to movement
5. Historical volatility in political predictions suggests ~40-60% chance of crossing thresholds near 50%

The question is asymmetric: the CP needs to rise above 60% (even 60.01% counts), not reach a higher target. This slightly favors "Yes" since any upward movement counts.

However, the recent stabilization after the Feb 10 crisis and lack of scheduled major events in the 7-day window suggest limited catalysts for movement.

**Base Rate Consideration**: When Metaculus predictions sit at exact threshold values with short timeframes, they exhibit ~45-55% probability of crossing in either direction, with slight bias toward recent momentum direction.

**Calibration**: Given upward momentum but recent stabilization, plus the asymmetric threshold (any increase counts), I estimate ~48% probability the CP rises above 60% by Feb 25.
