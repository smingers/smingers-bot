Analysis:

1. Source analysis (quality & date, fact vs. opinion – highlights only)

• BBC 10 Feb 26 “Three things that could bring Starmer down” – high-quality; facts: Sarwar resignation call, Mandelson documents due, dates of by-election/local elections. Opinions: unnamed MPs; balanced.  
• Hyphen 11 Feb 26 “Starmer has clung on” – mid-quality niche outlet; new facts on PLP meeting mood; quotes MPs. Mostly reportage, some opinion.  
• Al-Jazeera 10 Feb 26 “A coup that never was” – high-quality; adds detail on Epstein files, staff resignations, Tim Bale expert view.  
• YouGov poll article 05 Feb 26 – high-quality methodology; gives hard polling numbers (Lab 21%, Reform 30%+).  
• Times 16 Feb 26 approval-rating tracker – high-quality; hard data (net −50).  
• Fresh news 16-18 Feb 26 (Mirror, Independent, Sky, AFP, Daily Star, etc.) – credible mainstream outlets; hard fact: government’s forced U-turn on postponing May local elections after Reform court win. Shows continued political weakness.  
• EXPRESS, Breitbart, tabloid opinion pieces – low-moderate quality; use only for sentiment flavour, not probability.

2. Evidence analysis (graded)

Strong evidence  
• Scheduled danger points fall after the checkpoint (Feb 26 by-election, 7 May locals) → structural reason hazard may rise later, not this week.  
• Labour leadership rules: no quick mechanism = procedural friction lowers very-short-term exit risk.

Moderate evidence  
• U-turn and legal defeat (16-18 Feb) keep scandal narrative alive, may nudge Metaculus users upward in next few days.  
• Mandelson document dump “huge” but timing unknown – open tail risk between now and 25 Feb.  
• Polls and approval numbers deeply negative with persistent downward trend – background pressure that keeps community estimate elevated.

Weak evidence  
• Bank analyst/partisan claims Starmer “gone by June” – single opinions, limited forecasting track record.  
• Crowd-sourced iNews competition (64 % Starmer stays) – game context differs from Metaculus weighting, small sample.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window = 7 days.  
If the window were halved (3-4 days) I would lower probability ~3 pp (less time for new bombshells).  
If doubled to 14 days I would raise probability ~6 pp (includes by-election result).

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  

Outside-view baseline (see earlier work): 44 %.  
Inside factors pushing UP (>60):  
  a) Fresh U-turn narrative reinforces “chaos” (+2 pp)  
  b) Possibility Mandelson files or further resignations emerge pre-25 Feb (+3 pp)  
  c) Metaculus recency-weighted median is sensitive; a handful of high-cred forecasters can lift it a point or two when news is negative (+1 pp)  

Factors pushing DOWN (≤60):  
  d) Immediate coup fizzled, cabinet united (−2 pp)  
  e) Structural difficulty of removing a Labour PM quickly (−2 pp)  
  f) Need to be strictly > 60.00; status-quo tie means No (−1 pp)  

Net upward +6, downward −5 ⇒ +1 relative to 44 % → 45 %.

Probability calibration

I expect that in 45 out of 100 similar one-week periods the Metaculus community prediction would end strictly above 60 %.

Checklist:

1. Paraphrase – On 25 Feb 26, will Metaculus probability that Starmer leaves office in 2026 exceed 60 %?  
2. Outside view base rate stated (44 %).  
3. Single-line consistency – “About 45 times out of 100, the CP ends >60 % on 25 Feb.”  
4. Key evidence (≤20 w each):  
  • Coup averted; cabinet rallied.  
  • Feb 26 by-election after checkpoint.  
  • New U-turn headlines keep negative momentum.  
  • Structural difficulty of fast leadership ouster.  
  • Unknown Mandelson file release window.  
5. Blind-spot – Sudden leak (e-mails, police arrest) this weekend spikes CP to >70 %; would raise chance >15 pp.  
6. Status-quo bias – Tie or slight drift downward yields No; reinforce slight adjustment toward ≤60.

Probability: 45%
