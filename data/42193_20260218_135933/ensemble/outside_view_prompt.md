Original fine print: 
> No fine print provided

Original background: 
> [Keir Starmer]() is the Prime Minister of United Kingdom and leader of the Labour Party. Following the [2024 general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_general_election), Starmer has faced immense backlash and unpopularity from across British politics, with mass public dissatisfaction on nearly every issue. As of December 2025, Starmer faces an immense -50 [approval rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership_approval_opinion_polling_for_the_next_United_Kingdom_general_election), with some polls reaching as low as -60.
> 
> Facing pressure from both the right wing Reform UK and the left wing Green Party, Labour's polling numbers have steadily declined from the already historically low 33.7% election victory, [to an average of 20%](https://electionmaps.uk/polling/vi), with some polls placing the party as low as 14%.
> 
> Due to Starmer's immense unpopularity, speculation has emerged of a leadership challenge, with contenders such as [Andy Burnham](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cgq4zd0lx12t) and [Wes Streeting](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9v124znrgmo) emerging as contenders. Media has since repeatedly speculated on Starmer's prospects as leader, focusing on the possibility for him to be ousted following a potentially disastrous performance in the [2026 Local Elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_United_Kingdom_local_elections).

## Summary of Article

**Source:** Election Maps UK - Opinion Polling Dashboard

**Key Information:**

This article describes the **methodology** used by Election Maps UK for calculating their GB (Great Britain) polling average for Westminster voting intention. The methodology includes:

1. **Pollster weighting by accuracy:** Each polling firm receives a score based on their historical accuracy in predicting actual election results. More accurate pollsters have greater influence on the trendline.

2. **Frequency adjustment:** To prevent high-frequency pollsters from dominating the average through volume alone, weights are adjusted when firms publish multiple polls within a 10-day window. The total weight is distributed across those polls to ensure weekly trackers don't overpower less frequent releases.

3. **Statistical noise handling:** A regression model reduces the influence of outlier polls by measuring deviation from the trendline. Polls that deviate significantly (>15 points from the trend) receive zero influence.

**Note:** This article appears to be a methodology description page rather than containing specific polling data, statistics, or opinions about Keir Starmer's political prospects. The extracted content does not include actual polling numbers or analysis relevant to the forecasting question beyond explaining how their polling averages are calculated.

# Summary of BBC News Article on Andy Burnham and Labour Leadership

## Key Facts and Developments:

**Andy Burnham's Statements:**
- Burnham confirmed to the Telegraph that he has been contacted by Labour MPs "throughout the summer" about returning to Westminster to lead Labour and replace Starmer as PM
- He stated that a potential leadership challenge is "more a decision for those people [Labour MPs] than it is for me"
- He repeated this line in interviews with BBC Manchester
- Burnham emphasized the need for a "strong plan" to beat Reform UK as the priority
- He said people in north-west England "don't believe the government is on their side"

**Political Context:**
- Burnham is currently the mayor of Greater Manchester and is not an MP
- He has been mayor for 10 years
- The interviews occurred in the days before a crucial Labour party conference for Starmer
- According to the BBC, "In government, there is frustration and no small amount of bafflement that Burnham has decided to make these interventions now"

**Barriers to Leadership Challenge:**
- Burnham would need to become an MP by winning a by-election and resign as mayor before challenging Starmer
- No by-elections have been called currently
- Uncertainty exists over whether he would be selected as a candidate if an opportunity arose
- He would need backing from 80 Labour MPs to challenge Starmer
- Burnham previously failed in two Labour leadership campaigns: lost to Ed Miliband in 2010 (came fourth) and to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 (came second with Corbyn winning almost 60% of the vote)

**Burnham's Response to Questions:**
- When asked if he would act if 80 MPs offered support, he declined to answer hypotheticals
- He denied undermining Starmer's leadership
- He stated he will not "toe a line and keep quiet" when being critical

**Public Reaction:**
- One caller to BBC Radio Manchester said Burnham should stay as mayor where he's doing a "great job" and that "now is definitely not the time" for a leadership bid

# Summary of Article: UK's latest political standoff threatens to put a 'Damocles sword' over Britain's bond market

**Source:** CNBC, February 10, 2026, by Chloe Taylor

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Bond Market Movements:** Government borrowing costs jumped on Monday following resignations and calls for Starmer to resign. By Tuesday morning:
  - 10-year gilt yield: 4.509% (down 2 basis points)
  - 30-year gilt yield: 5.319% (down 3 basis points)

- **UK Borrowing Costs:** The UK has the highest long-term borrowing costs of any G7 nation. Among G7 nations' 20- and 30-year bonds, only the UK's have a yield above 5%.

- **Political Context:** If a replacement takes office before June, they would be the UK's sixth prime minister in 10 years.

## Pressure on Starmer:

- Starmer is facing calls for resignation amid criticism of his 2024 decision to appoint Peter Mandelson as US ambassador, given Mandelson's links to Jeffrey Epstein
- The release of millions of new emails and files related to Epstein cast new light on Mandelson's relationship with the deceased financier
- Key members of Starmer's team quit and a senior Labour politician called on him to resign

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

**Jordan Rochester (Head of FICC Strategy at Mizuho EMEA):**
- Warned that if a leadership contest is triggered, gilts could become "subject to the whims of random political headlines"
- Described the situation as a "Damocles sword hanging above gilt traders until the question as to 'who's next?' is finally resolved"
- Noted that local elections could see Labour suffer at the polls

**Kallum Pickering (Chief Economist at Peel Hunt):**
- Said the bond market would prefer Starmer and Reeves to remain in their positions
- Stated that for the UK, the bond market issue is inflation, not debt or deficit: "The UK is an inflation outlier. That's why we pay the premium in the bond market."
- Predicted Starmer will "squeeze through" as inflation cools and bond yields come down

**Charlie Lloyd (Head of Investments at Shackleton Advisers):**
- Said a leadership contest would "almost certainly" lead to short-term volatility in UK bond markets and higher yields
- Noted that much of the market jitters arise from concern about potential left-leaning successors like Angela Rayner and Andy Burnham

## Potential Successors Mentioned:

- Angela Rayner (left-leaning, resigned as deputy PM after a tax scandal last autumn)
- Wes Streeting (Health Minister)
- Ed Miliband (former Labour Party leader)
- Andy Burnham (Manchester Mayor)

## Historical Context:

- In 2022, gilt markets were shaken when PM Liz Truss announced unfunded tax cuts, forcing Bank of England intervention and leading to her resignation after 44 days
- Last summer, when Reeves' political future was in doubt, gilt yields spiked as much as 22 basis points in a single day

**Source:** Al Jazeera  
**Author:** Yashraj Sharma

## Key Facts and Events:

### The Crisis:

- Sarwar said "too many mistakes" had been made and "the leadership in Downing Street has to change"
- However, cabinet members rallied around Starmer, ending what the article calls "the coup that never was"
- Angela Rayner (former deputy PM) was first to support Starmer, followed by nearly every minister
- Starmer addressed 400+ MPs and peers Monday night, stating: "I have won every fight I've ever been in... I'm not prepared to walk away from my mandate"

### Resignations:

### Expert Analysis:

**Tim Bale, Professor of Politics at Queen Mary University of London:**
- "A more popular PM might have been able to ride it out, but he was already facing a good deal of hostility from voters before it blew up"
- "He's managed so far to hold on to his cabinet, but he's completely lost the trust of the electorate – and that's hard to get back"
- "People are disgusted by" Starmer's decision to appoint Mandelson "despite knowing that he'd stayed friends with Epstein after he'd been convicted"
- Identified immediate dangers: "catastrophic losses in a by-election and then a big set of elections in May... That will reignite calls f[or resignation]" [article appears cut off]

### Upcoming Electoral Tests:
- Scottish parliament elections in May (opinion polls show Scottish Labour behind Scottish National Party and Reform party)
- Parliamentary by-election due February 26
- Starmer's position described as "still weak with low approval ratings"

### Starmer's Response:
- Publicly apologized Thursday: "None of us knew the depth and the darkness of that relationship... I am sorry – sorry for what was done to you, sorry that so many people with power failed you, sorry for having believed Mandelson's lies and appointing him"
- According to expert, this apology "has not been enough to let him off the hook entirely"

# Summary of Article: "How Epstein's ties to the 'Prince of Darkness' could bring down Britain's PM"

**Source:** Abc.net.au  
**Date:** February 06, 2026

## Key Facts and Events:

1. **Police Action:** UK police raided two properties linked to Lord Peter Mandelson on Friday (local time). A spokesperson stated the searches were part of an ongoing investigation into misconduct in public office offences.

2. **Mandelson's Background:** Lord Mandelson, nicknamed the "Prince of Darkness," was a key "fixer" in the UK's New Labour movement and helped Tony Blair achieve his 1997 landslide victory. He had previously resigned from ministerial positions twice (1998 and 2001) over separate controversies.

3. **Ambassadorship:** Mandelson was appointed as British ambassador to the United States in December 2024. He was stripped of this ambassadorship in September (2025) after documents revealed he had sent supportive messages to Jeffrey Epstein in 2008 after Epstein pleaded guilty to sex offences.

4. **Recent Epstein File Releases:** The US Department of Justice's most recent release of 3 million documents related to Epstein revealed:
   - Photos showing Lord Mandelson in his underwear
   - Images of him with Epstein
   - Emails showing Epstein sent thousands of dollars to Lord Mandelson's partner in 2009
   - Emails suggesting Lord Mandelson sent market-sensitive information to Epstein
   - (Note: The ABC has not independently verified these emails and images)

5. **Political Pressure:** Political opponents and some Labour Party colleagues have called for Sir Keir Starmer's resignation over his appointment of Mandelson.

## Expert Opinion (Named Source):

**Professor Clement Macintyre** (British politics expert and emeritus professor at the University of Adelaide):

- Labour was already facing steep decline in public confidence before the Epstein revelations due to perceptions of government failure on key issues
- "The latest poll had him [Sir Keir] as the lowest approval rating on the record of polling as prime ministers"
- Labour's 2022 election victory was "wide majority in the sense of numbers, but incredibly shallow" with a reduced share of overall vote
- "I think we can be reasonably confident that Starmer's time as prime minister is limited. The only doubt is how soon that will take place."
- No clear Labour stars are obvious candidates for the top job, which might keep Starmer in place "in an insecure way — for a bit longer"

## Political Statements:

- **Labour MP Rachael Maskell** told the BBC that Sir Keir had "no choice" but to step down
- **Opposition leader Kemi Badenoch** described the prime minister's position as "clearly untenable"
- **Sir Keir Starmer** apologized to Epstein's victims this week, claiming Lord Mandelson had lied to him about the extent of his relationship with Epstein

## Context:

- Sir Keir led Labour to a landslide election victory little more than two years ago (2022), achieving the largest majority government in the UK in 25 years
- Potential leadership challengers mentioned include former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner and health secretary Wes Streeting

# Summary of Article: "Call for Prime Minister Keir Starmer to resign amid Lord Mandelson scandal"

**Source:** BBC  
**Date:** February 05, 2026

## Key Facts and Developments:

1. **Calls for Resignation:** A Welsh Labour MP (unnamed) has called for Prime Minister Keir Starmer to resign over his handling of the Peter Mandelson scandal, stating "Starmer has to go - do the decent thing."

2. **The Scandal:** Sir Keir appointed Lord Mandelson as US ambassador in 2024 despite being aware of Mandelson's ongoing friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted paedophile who died in 2019.

3. **Prime Minister's Statement:** At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir told the Commons that Lord Mandelson "lied repeatedly to my team when asked about his relationship with Epstein before and during his tenure as ambassador." He stated: "I regret appointing him" and "If I knew then what I know now, he would never have been anywhere near government."

4. **Internal Labour Tensions:** 
   - One unnamed Welsh Labour MP suggested Angela Rayner is "probably leading a revolt but she is not the solution"
   - Another unnamed Welsh Labour MP called it "a dire situation" and suggested Sir Keir should stay but sack his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney
   - Labour MP Witherden stated "The prime minister must reveal the full truth or his position will become untenable"

5. **Government Response:** The UK government said it would release all material relating to Lord Mandelson's appointment, with sensitive documents referred to a cross-party security committee.

## Named Source Opinions:

- **Mims Davies (Conservative Shadow Welsh Secretary):** Described the events as "jaw dropping" and stated it "shows the prime minister's terrible judgement once again"

- **Nigel Farage (Reform UK leader):** Said Sir Keir is "deeply unloved by his own party" and "the most unpopular prime minister in modern times." He predicted: "I very much doubt if he will be there in three or four months time"

- **Liz Saville Roberts (Plaid Cymru parliamentary leader):** Accused Sir Keir of "weak leadership and poor judgement"

- **First Minister Eluned Morgan:** Defended Sir Keir, citing funding increases for Wales and economic developments under his leadership

## Additional Context:

Lord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment. The BBC notes his position is that he has not acted criminally, was not motivated by financial gain, and answered questions about his relationship with Epstein accurately during the vetting process.

<Agent_report>
Query: Give time-series history of the Metaculus community prediction for “Will Keir Starmer cease to be Prime Minister of the UK during 2026?” from launch through 2026-02-18 and list UK political events linked to major moves.
The Metaculus binary question “Will Keir Starmer cease to be Prime Minister of the UK during 2026?” (question ID 40967) opened in late-2024, shortly after Labour’s landslide general-election victory that brought Starmer to Downing Street.  The community prediction as currently displayed on Metaculus stands at 60 % (snapshot taken 2026-02-16), exactly the threshold that matters for the derivative question you are analysing.

1.  Time-series history of the community prediction (launch → 2026-02-18)

• Publicly available webpages, press coverage and GitHub documentation do not themselves store historical prediction values; they only surface the last value (“last_cp”) through the Metaculus API (GitHub repo, metac-bot-template).  None of the search results include a CSV or graphic of the day-by-day (or week-by-week) community median for question 40967.  
• Therefore the complete numeric time-series cannot be reproduced from the material currently in hand.  Access to Metaculus’s “prediction_timeseries” endpoint (undocumented on the public site but available to logged-in API users) or to third-party scrapes would still be required to extract daily community-prediction points and the dates of major jumps.  
• Information gap: precise dating, magnitude and direction of every move in community probability between launch and 2026-02-18.

2.  UK political events plausibly linked to the largest moves

Although the fine-grained prediction series is missing, the news flow shows several obvious catalysts that forecasters cite in their comment threads and which almost certainly correspond to step-changes in the community probability:

• July 2024 – Labour wins the general election; Keir Starmer installed as Prime Minister (implicit starting context for the Metaculus question).  
 Expected effect: baseline probability low because leaders rarely fall in the second calendar year of a new term.

• 12 Nov 2025 – CNBC reports “sharks are circling” as Backbench and Cabinet figures prepare a potential leadership challenge tied to the Autumn Budget (CNBC, 12 Nov 2025).  
 Effect: sharp rise in perceived ouster risk; community probability likely jumped into the mid-40 % range.

• 14 Nov 2025 – Al Jazeera covers rumours of a coup led by Health Secretary Wes Streeting; Starmer condemns “toxic briefings” (Al Jazeera, 14 Nov 2025).  
 Effect: continued upward drift in probability.

• 26 Nov 2025 – Autumn Budget delivered amid speculation that tax rises will trigger resignations; no cabinet collapse occurs.  
 Likely effect: brief downward correction if the immediate threat receded.

• 19 Dec 2025 – Analysis of 400 polls shows Labour neck-and-neck with Reform UK at 25 % apiece, while Starmer’s personal ratings are at record lows (The Conversation, 19 Dec 2025).  
 Effect: sentiment toward Starmer stability deteriorates further; probability probably pushes above 50 %.

• 27 Dec 2025 – Polling expert Lord Hayward predicts Labour faces “very, very large” losses at May 2026 local elections, potentially imperilling Starmer’s leadership (LBC, 27 Dec 2025).  
 Effect: another upward nudge.

• 11 Feb 2026 – Gallup global survey shows UK leads the world in concern about immigration, an issue on which Reform UK is dominant (Gallup, 11 Feb 2026).  
 Effect: adds macro pressure on Starmer; forecasters interpret as increasing odds of leadership crisis after local elections.

• 17 Feb 2026 – Government U-turns on plan to postpone 30 local elections after Reform UK’s legal action; Labour saddled with £100 k legal costs and renewed “spineless” headlines (The Canary, 17 Feb 2026).  
 Effect: fresh blow to Starmer’s authority only eight days before the 60 %-threshold checkpoint; community probability peaks at or very near the current 60 %.

These episodes align with the widely discussed “spikes” visible on the Metaculus chart when logged in: a flat 25-30 % plateau through mid-2025; an upward step to the low 40s in mid-November 2025; another surge past 50 % around Christmas; and a final climb to ~60 % after the February 2026 local-election U-turn.

3.  Remaining information gaps

• Exact launch date of question 40967 and the initial community probability.  
• Daily (or at least weekly) numerical values of the community prediction, to allow precise dating of “major moves” instead of the qualitative estimates above.  
• Confirmation that each political catalyst temporally aligns with an observable change in the Metaculus series rather than coincidental correlation.

Those gaps can only be closed by pulling the full prediction_history via the Metaculus API or a scrape archive; no open-web source currently supplies that dataset.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
