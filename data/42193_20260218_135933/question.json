    "description": "Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40967\n- Original question title: Will Keir Starmer cease to be Prime Minister of the UK during 2026?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 60.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> This question will resolve as **Yes** if, at any point before January 1, 2027, Keir Starmer ceases to be Prime Minister of the United Kingdom.\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> No fine print provided\n\nOriginal background: \n> [Keir Starmer]() is the Prime Minister of United Kingdom and leader of the Labour Party. Following the [2024 general election](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_Kingdom_general_election), Starmer has faced immense backlash and unpopularity from across British politics, with mass public dissatisfaction on nearly every issue. As of December 2025, Starmer faces an immense -50 [approval rating](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leadership_approval_opinion_polling_for_the_next_United_Kingdom_general_election), with some polls reaching as low as -60.\n> \n> Facing pressure from both the right wing Reform UK and the left wing Green Party, Labour's polling numbers have steadily declined from the already historically low 33.7% election victory, [to an average of 20%](https://electionmaps.uk/polling/vi), with some polls placing the party as low as 14%.\n> \n> Due to Starmer's immense unpopularity, speculation has emerged of a leadership challenge, with contenders such as [Andy Burnham](https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cgq4zd0lx12t) and [Wes Streeting](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9v124znrgmo) emerging as contenders. Media has since repeatedly speculated on Starmer's prospects as leader, focusing on the possibility for him to be ousted following a potentially disastrous performance in the [2026 Local Elections](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2026_United_Kingdom_local_elections).\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":40967,\"question_id\":40675,\"last_cp\":0.6}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40967) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-25 17:11:42 is higher than 60.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 60.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled.
