Analysis:
The Metaculus community forecast will respond primarily to any fresh evidence that Keir Starmer might leave office during 2026.  Forecasters will therefore watch for:  
• Reports of organised leadership challenges or letters of no-confidence inside the parliamentary Labour Party.  
• Statements from senior Labour figures (e.g., Burnham, Streeting) hinting at bids or urging Starmer to quit.  
• Dramatic new polling showing Labour heading for a “wipe-out” in the May 2026 local elections.  
• Major scandals, health issues, or policy crises that could pressure Starmer to resign or be ousted.  
• Commentary from reputable political correspondents and bookmakers revising odds on Starmer’s tenure.  
Finding the most up-to-date coverage on these topics—especially in the week leading up to 18-25 Feb 2026—will give clues about whether the Metaculus community prediction is likely to rise above the current 60 % threshold.
