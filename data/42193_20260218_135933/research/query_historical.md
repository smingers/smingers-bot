Analysis:
The key to judging whether the Metaculus community prediction will drift above 60 % in the next week is understanding (a) recent and imminent political developments that might convince forecasters Starmer will be forced out in 2026 and (b) the past behaviour of the Metaculus crowd on similar UK-leadership questions.  Useful historical context therefore includes: previous instances of UK prime-ministerial removals mid-term; current reporting on Labour Party discontent and possible leadership challenges; recent polling and approval-rating data; and the time-series history of the target Metaculus prediction itself (to see how quickly it moves on news).  We do not need macro-economic data, so no FRED query is required.
