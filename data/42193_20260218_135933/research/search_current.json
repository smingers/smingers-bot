The Mandelson Documents (timing unclear):**\n- Documents related to Lord Mandelson's appointment will be published at some point\n- Starmer believes these will prove Mandelson lied during vetting about his Epstein links\n- The scope of documents to be published is \"huge\" - including communications between Mandelson, ministers, and special advisers\n- Could reveal more embarrassing information, particularly if related to Number 10\n\n**2. February 26 - Gorton and Denton by-election:**\n- Labour won this seat comfortably in 2024\n- Some in the party fear they could finish third behind both the Greens and Reform UK\n- A disaster would be \"tangible example of recent troubles having an impact at the ballot box\" and would \"inevitably spook\" Labour MPs\n\n**3. May 7 - Elections in Scotland, Wales and English councils:**\n- Described as potentially \"the most dangerous moment yet\"\n- Widespread expectation Labour will lose power in Wales for the first time since devolution, potentially finishing third behind Plaid Cymru and Reform\n- Third place in Scotland behind SNP and Reform seen as real possibility\n- Labour fears \"a thumping in local council elections in England\"\n\n## Factors That May Protect Starmer:\n\n**Procedural Difficulties:**\n- No easy mechanism for Labour MPs to remove a leader \"cleanly and quickly\"\n- A leadership challenge would take weeks if the PM decides to fight on\n- Alternative methods (confidence vote among MPs, coordinated message from senior figures) are \"not guaranteed to work\"\n\n**Lack of Clear Successor:**\n- No obvious successor at present\n- Main potential candidates face significant problems:\n  - **Wes Streeting** (Health Secretary): Has longstanding links to Lord Mandelson\n  - **Angela Rayner** (former Deputy PM): Being investigated by HMRC over tax on her second home with no resolution yet\n  - Other names mentioned: Defence Secretary John Healey, Armed Forces Minister Al Carns, Energy Secretary Ed Miliband, Home Secretary Shabana Mahmood\n- The open field makes MPs nervous about getting an undesired leader\n- Factional concerns: Centre might fear bringing down PM if left-wing figure could win; left might fear swift process installing someone they dislike\n\n**International Context:**\n- Some Labour MPs wary of sparking leadership election during ongoing Ukraine war and President Trump's \"unpredictable approach to diplomacy\"\n\n## Conclusion:\nThe article notes that Starmer's speech to the Parliamentary Labour Party \"appears to have calmed some nerves for the time being.\" While Labour MPs are angry and \"willing to talk at length about the prime minister's future,\" the article concludes that \"leadership crises can be drawn out affairs\" and \"Sir Keir may be in Number 10 for a while yet.\"\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://hyphenonline.com/2026/02/11/keir-starmer-anas-sarwar-leadership-challenge-wes-streeting-shehab-khan/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Starmer has clung on.

He cited a drop in inflation to 3%, down from higher levels, and noted that interest rates have been reduced six times, leading to lower mortgage costs. Starmer emphasized that falling inflation is directly easing the cost of living, as reflected in reduced prices at supermarkets and petrol stations. Speaking alongside First Minister Eluned Morgan at a transport depot, he stated that stabilizing the economy is the government's top priority and that the progress is 'real evidence' of success. He also criticized Nigel Farage's Reform Party for reversing its position and proposing to reinstate the two-child benefit cap, calling it 'shameful' and warning it would push hundreds of thousands of children into poverty. Starmer highlighted that Labour's decision to scrap the cap, supported by MPs, is expected to lift 450,000 children out of poverty.

This follows his speech at the Munich Security Conference on February 14, 2026, where he urged Europe to 'be ready to fight,' describing Europe as a 'sleeping giant' with substantial defense capabilities that remain underutilized due to lack of coordination. Starmer emphasized that the UK's defense spending depends on collaboration with 'like-minded nations, especially European countries.' The UK previously announced plans to increase defense spending to 2.5% of GDP by 2027 and to 3% by 2029.

In England, 136 local authorities\u2014including all 32 London boroughs\u2014will hold elections, with Reform UK targeting commuter areas in Essex and the South East, such as Thurrock, Harlow, and Basildon, capitalizing on voter frustration over migration, housing, and public services. Reform is also aiming to gain ground in traditional Labour 'Red Wall' constituencies like West Lancashire, Preston, and Darwen. In London, the Greens are challenging Labour in urban boroughs like Hackney, Lambeth, and Southwark, where Labour's majorities are strong but not secure, driven by left-wing discontent over cost of living, climate change, and the Gaza war. In Scotland, YouGov polling shows the SNP at 34%, Reform UK at 20%, and Labour at 15%, indicating Labour's weakening position and internal strain. In Wales, Labour trails at around 10% in Senedd polling, with Plaid Cymru leading and Reform in second\u2014marking a seismic shift in a region Labour has long dominated. The government faced backlash after reversing a controversial plan to delay 30 council elections affecting 4.6 million voters, with Reform UK leader Nigel Farage calling the reversal a 'victory for democracy' and highlighting the potential \u00a3100,000 in legal costs for taxpayers.

The initial plan, aimed at freeing up 'capacity' for council structural reforms, was abandoned following legal advice after a challenge by Reform UK leader Nigel Farage, who stated, 'we took this Labour government to court and won.' Laura Lock, deputy chief executive of the Association of Electoral Administrators, described the reversal as 'extremely disappointing,' noting that election workers had lost months of essential planning time.

However, after a legal challenge from Reform UK, government lawyers provided new advice stating the cancellation would be illegal. As a result, the government abandoned the plan, reinstating over 4.5 million additional voters in the May elections. The government must now also scrap the planned legislation enabling the change and will pay Reform UK\u2019s legal fees, estimated to be a six-figure sum. Opposition parties hailed the reversal as a democratic victory, with Reform UK, led by Nigel Farage, using the outcome to criticize Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer.

Originally, elections in these areas were to be delayed until 2027 due to planned boundary reorganization. The government cited 'a new legal advice' as the reason for the reversal, with Communities Secretary Steve Reed confirming that all local elections will take place in May 2026. The initial decision to postpone had been announced just one month earlier, with officials arguing it was necessary to enable a comprehensive reorganization of local government. However, right-wing politician Nigel Farage, leader of the anti-immigration party Reform UK, challenged the plan in court, and the UK Supreme Court was set to hear the case on Thursday. Farage declared victory on Monday, stating, 'We brought this Labour government to court and won,' and claimed that only Reform UK truly defends democracy. He accused Starmer of attempting to disenfranchise 4.6 million voters on May 7.

Local Government Secretary Steve Reed confirmed the reversal, stating that \u00a362 million would be allocated to support affected councils and that officials would contact them to assess further needs.

Reform UK leader Nigel Farage hailed the decision as a victory for democracy, claiming Labour had attempted to block 4.6 million voters from participating. Conservative Leader Kemi Badenoch criticized the reversal as evidence of 'predictable chaos' and a 'zombie government' unable to execute basic decisions. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey described the reversal as a 'humiliating U-turn,' accusing the government of being intimidated by Reform UK. Cllr Richard Wright of the District Councils' Network expressed confusion and concern over the constant changes to the electoral timetable, warning that councils now face a 'race against time' to prepare, while questioning the government\u2019s ability to manage the legal and logistical complexity of the reorganisation. The announcement was published on February 16, 2026, by ITV Hub.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 03:37 PM\nSource:[ITV Hub](https://www.itv.com/news/2026-02-16/starmer-abandons-plans-to-delay-30-local-elections-in-latest-u-turn)\n\n**Starmer out, and Badenoch too? The crowd-sourced political predictions for 2026**\nAccording to the 'Wisdom of the Crowd' forecast from Iain Mansfield's annual UK forecasting competition, Keir Starmer has a 64% chance of remaining Prime Minister by 31 December 2026, down from 92% in 2025, reflecting a decline in confidence since the Mandelson scandal. Kemi Badenoch faces a similar fate, with a 64% chance of remaining Conservative Party leader. Reform UK leader Nigel Farage is seen as more secure, with a 90% chance of staying in leadership. The crowd predicts Reform UK will win the most seats in local elections (59% chance), but not in Wales (41% chance), and expects Labour to lose at least half the seats they are defending. In national polling, Reform UK has a 46% chance of averaging 33% or higher by year-end. In the U.S., Democrats have a 71% chance of winning the House and a 51% chance of winning the Senate, while there is a 57% chance U.S. actions will cause regime change in another country. In Ukraine, a lasting ceasefire is seen as 38% likely, a Russian breakthrough 31% likely, and China blockading Taiwan 38% likely (up from 27% in 2025). England's chance of winning the 2026 World Cup is estimated at 19%. The competition, which attracted 1,109 entries this year\u2014378 from political or public policy professionals\u2014relies on the 'Wisdom of Crowds' principle, where collective predictions outperform individual experts. However, Mansfield cautions that the model is not infallible and may miss 'black swan' events. Despite past accuracy, the crowd failed to predict the Conservative victory in Canada\u2019s 2025 election.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 13, 2026 03:41 PM\nSource:[inews.co.uk](https://inews.co.uk/news/politics/starmer-badenoch-crowd-sourced-predicting-politics-2026-4224750)\n\n**British PM Starmer Insists He Will Still Be in Office by End of Year**\nBritish Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer reaffirmed his intention to remain in office through 2027 amid growing speculation of an internal Labour Party leadership challenge, as his government's approval rating plummeted to 12% in the final YouGov survey of 2025\u2014matching the low level that preceded Rishi Sunak\u2019s ousting in the 2024 general election. Despite failing to deliver on key promises, including curbing illegal Channel crossings and reviving economic growth, Starmer asserted pride in 'material changes' brought by his administration, citing the chaos caused by frequent leadership shifts under the previous Conservative government as a reason for stability. In a BBC interview with Laura Kuenssberg, he declared, 'I will be sitting in this seat by 2027,' dismissing the prospect of a leadership challenge as contrary to national interest. However, public confidence is low: half of Britons expect Starmer to be replaced before the year ends. Rumors have circulated about potential challengers, including Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham and former deputy Angela Rayner. Meanwhile, Reform UK leader Nigel Farage predicted that economic turmoil would force Starmer into calling an early election before the scheduled 2029 vote, which would likely benefit his party. According to the latest Multilevel Regression and Post-stratification (MRP) poll from More in Common, Reform UK is projected to win 381 seats\u2014up from 5\u2014giving it a 112-seat majority over all other parties. Labour is forecast to drop from 411 to 85 seats, while the Conservatives would fall to 70 seats.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 04, 2026 03:22 PM\nSource:[Breitbart](https://www.breitbart.com/europe/2026/01/04/british-pm-starmer-insists-he-will-still-be-in-office-by-end-of-year/)\n\n**Not In National interest: UK PM Keir Starmer On Possible Leadership Change**\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated on January 4, 2026, that he would remain in office by this time next year despite low poll numbers and speculation about a leadership challenge. He dismissed the upcoming local elections in England, Wales, and Scotland as not being a 'referendum' on his government, emphasizing that 'chopping and changing' leadership\u2014such as under the previous Conservative government\u2014was not in the national interest. Starmer cited the instability caused by frequent leadership changes under Boris Johnson, Liz Truss (the shortest-serving UK prime minister), and Rishi Sunak, which contributed to the Conservatives' defeat in the 2024 general election. His Labour Party currently trails Reform UK in opinion polls, and his personal approval ratings are at historic lows. Nevertheless, Starmer affirmed his commitment to staying in power, stating he would 'fight for every vote.' He acknowledged that life remains 'harder than it should be' for many Britons but predicted improvements in public services and the cost of living in 2026. He also said he would be judged on his performance at the next general election.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 04, 2026 03:13 PM\nSource:[NDTV](https://www.ndtv.com/world-news/not-in-national-interest-uk-pm-keir-starmer-on-possible-leadership-change-10299904)\n\n**UK's embattled Starmer vows to see out five-year term**\nKeir Starmer, the UK Prime Minister elected in July 2024, reaffirmed in a BBC interview on January 4, 2026, that he intends to complete his five-year mandate despite growing speculation about his leadership following poor polling ahead of the May 2026 local elections. Starmer argued that Britain's national interest lies in deepening alignment with the EU single market, citing improved relations as the best in a decade and noting the UK's re-entry into the Erasmus student exchange programme and sectoral alignment in food and agriculture. He rejected rejoining the EU customs union or restoring freedom of movement but emphasized the need for 'closer' ties on a 'sector-by-sector basis'. His stance is expected to draw criticism from Brexit hardliners, particularly Nigel Farage and Reform UK, which leads in polls and is projected to gain significantly in the upcoming local elections and potentially win the next general election by August 2029. Starmer warned that a Reform UK victory would lead to 'toxic' division and vowed to lead Labour in 'the fight of our times'. Despite a turbulent 2025 marked by policy U-turns, ministerial resignations, and declining popularity, Starmer maintained that Labour's achievements\u2014particularly in EU relations\u2014have been overlooked and predicted a turning point in 2026. Polls indicate Labour's poor performance in May 2026 could trigger a leadership challenge.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 04, 2026 11:52 AM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/89KH39G)\n\n**Britain's Starmer says leadership change would 'not be in national interest'**\nBritish Prime Minister Keir Starmer stated on January 4, 2026, that he expects to remain in office a year from now, despite low public approval ratings and polling showing his Labour Party trailing Reform UK by 18 months after its 2024 landslide victory. Speaking to the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg, Starmer argued that leadership instability\u2014such as the 'chopping and changing' seen under the previous Conservative government\u2014would not be in the national interest. He cited the turbulent leadership transition from Boris Johnson to Liz Truss (the shortest-serving UK prime minister) to Rishi Sunak, which culminated in the Conservatives' defeat in 2024. Starmer emphasized that he would not step down even if a poor performance in the upcoming May local elections prompted a leadership challenge. He described the local elections as not a 'referendum' on him, but affirmed Labour\u2019s commitment to 'fight for every vote.' In a New Year message, Starmer acknowledged that life remains 'harder than it should be' for many Britons but predicted improvements in public services and cost of living in 2026.

These results could be 'decisive' for Starmer's future as Prime Minister. Predictions indicate significant defeats in Labour's traditional heartlands in England, potential loss of seats in the Welsh Senedd, and a 'battering' in the Scottish Parliament. The party is also expected to suffer substantial losses to Reform UK, the Greens, the Liberal Democrats, and in east London, to pro-Gaza Independent candidates. Council elections will be held across 32 London boroughs, Birmingham, Greater Manchester, Tyneside, and the Home Counties, with additional devolved elections in Scotland and Wales.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 27, 2025 01:35 PM\nSource:[EXPRESS](https://www.express.co.uk/news/politics/2150857/Keir-Starmer-local-elections-Labour-Conservatives-Tory-Reform-Local-Elections)\n\n**UK Prime Minister Starmer Predicted to Resign in 2026 Amid Political Crisis**\nAccording to The Daily Mail, citing anonymous sources in the UK Parliament, Prime Minister Keir Starmer of the Labour Party may resign from his position as early as 2026. The report indicates growing discussions among Labour MPs about a potential early departure by Starmer, amid a political crisis unfolding during a critical week as the government prepares to present one of the most anticipated budgets in modern British history. Parliamentarians have expressed concern over Starmer's 'zen-like demeanor,' which they believe does not reflect the mindset of a leader aiming to remain in power long-term. Upcoming general elections, scheduled for May 2026, are expected to be a major test for the Labour Party. A new poll conducted by Lord Ashcroft reveals that only 9% of voters believe Starmer will retain his premiership after the vote. Additionally, 69% of respondents indicated that Starmer's party shows signs of division, further weakening his position amid rising internal party dissatisfaction.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 23, 2025 12:49 PM\nSource:[\u041c\u043e\u0441\u043a\u043e\u0432\u0441\u043a\u0438\u0439 \u041a\u043e\u043c\u0441\u043e\u043c\u043e\u043b\u0435\u0446](https://www.mk.ru/politics/2025/11/23/premeru-velikobritanii-starmeru-predrekli-otstavku.html)\n\n**British Prime Minister Starmer Predicted to Resign Before Summer 2026 Amid Declining Support**\nAccording to The Daily Mail, UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer is expected to resign before summer 2026 due to a loss of public trust. Colleague journalist Andrew Neil reported that most members of the ruling Labour Party believe Starmer is ineffective both politically and in governance. Some party insiders are willing to wait until the May 2025 local elections in England, Scotland, and Wales\u2014predicted to be a 'catastrophe' for Labour\u2014while others argue that prolonging the crisis is unnecessary and want him removed by New Year 2025, when the failure of his budget statement will become evident. Despite Labour\u2019s victory in the 2024 general election\u2014the first in 14 years\u2014Starmer lost credibility by July 2025, including among party members, with some voting against government proposals, such as social benefit cuts.
