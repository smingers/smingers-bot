The methodology includes:\n\n1. **Pollster weighting by accuracy:** Each polling firm receives a score based on their historical accuracy in predicting actual election results. More accurate pollsters have greater influence on the trendline.\n\n2. **Frequency adjustment:** To prevent high-frequency pollsters from dominating the average through volume alone, weights are adjusted when firms publish multiple polls within a 10-day window. The total weight is distributed across those polls to ensure weekly trackers don't overpower less frequent releases.\n\n3. **Statistical noise handling:** A regression model reduces the influence of outlier polls by measuring deviation from the trendline. Polls that deviate significantly (>15 points from the trend) receive zero influence.\n\n**Note:** This article appears to be a methodology description page rather than containing specific polling data, statistics, or opinions about Keir Starmer's political prospects. The extracted content does not include actual polling numbers or analysis relevant to the forecasting question beyond explaining how their polling averages are calculated.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cgq4zd0lx12t\">\n# Summary of BBC News Article on Andy Burnham and Labour Leadership\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**Andy Burnham's Statements:**\n- Burnham confirmed to the Telegraph that he has been contacted by Labour MPs \"throughout the summer\" about returning to Westminster to lead Labour and replace Starmer as PM\n- He stated that a potential leadership challenge is \"more a decision for those people [Labour MPs] than it is for me\"\n- He repeated this line in interviews with BBC Manchester\n- Burnham emphasized the need for a \"strong plan\" to beat Reform UK as the priority\n- He said people in north-west England \"don't believe the government is on their side\"\n\n**Political Context:**\n- Burnham is currently the mayor of Greater Manchester and is not an MP\n- He has been mayor for 10 years\n- The interviews occurred in the days before a crucial Labour party conference for Starmer\n- According to the BBC, \"In government, there is frustration and no small amount of bafflement that Burnham has decided to make these interventions now\"\n\n**Barriers to Leadership Challenge:**\n- Burnham would need to become an MP by winning a by-election and resign as mayor before challenging Starmer\n- No by-elections have been called currently\n- Uncertainty exists over whether he would be selected as a candidate if an opportunity arose\n- He would need backing from 80 Labour MPs to challenge Starmer\n- Burnham previously failed in two Labour leadership campaigns: lost to Ed Miliband in 2010 (came fourth) and to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 (came second with Corbyn winning almost 60% of the vote)\n\n**Burnham's Response to Questions:**\n- When asked if he would act if 80 MPs offered support, he declined to answer hypotheticals\n- He denied undermining Starmer's leadership\n- He stated he will not \"toe a line and keep quiet\" when being critical\n\n**Public Reaction:**\n- One caller to BBC Radio Manchester said Burnham should stay as mayor where he's doing a \"great job\" and that \"now is definitely not the time\" for a leadership bid\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9v124znrgmo\">\n# Summary of BBC News Article (November 12, 2025)\n\n## Key Facts and Events:\n\n- **Date of Article:** November 12, 2025\n- **Main Subject:** Wes Streeting (Health Secretary) denies plotting against PM Keir Starmer after leadership challenge claims emerged\n\n- **Timeline:** On Tuesday evening (November 11), friends of Sir Keir told news outlets his job might be under \"immediate threat\" and expressed suspicion of Streeting's leadership ambitions\n\n- **Leadership Challenge Mechanics:** \n  - Challengers need support of 20% of Labour MPs to trigger a leadership contest\n  - Currently requires 80-81 nominations (article states both figures)\n\n## Direct Quotes and Statements:\n\n**Wes Streeting:**\n- Called suggestions he's challenging for leadership \"self-defeating nonsense\"\n- Said he could \"not see any circumstances under which I would do that to our prime minister\"\n- Called the culture in No 10 \"toxic\"\n- Urged Sir Keir to sack whoever is briefing the media\n- Said: \"Yes\" when asked if the PM should sack those responsible, adding \"But he's got to find them first\"\n\n**Other Named Sources:**\n- **Jo White MP** (chair of Red Wall Labour backbench group): Said this was \"neither the time or the place\" for briefings about a leadership challenge\n- **One minister:** \"He will fight this...

A spokesperson stated the searches were part of an ongoing investigation into misconduct in public office offences.\n\n2. **Mandelson's Background:** Lord Mandelson, nicknamed the \"Prince of Darkness,\" was a key \"fixer\" in the UK's New Labour movement and helped Tony Blair achieve his 1997 landslide victory. He had previously resigned from ministerial positions twice (1998 and 2001) over separate controversies.\n\n3. **Ambassadorship:** Mandelson was appointed as British ambassador to the United States in December 2024. He was stripped of this ambassadorship in September (2025) after documents revealed he had sent supportive messages to Jeffrey Epstein in 2008 after Epstein pleaded guilty to sex offences.\n\n4. **Recent Epstein File Releases:** The US Department of Justice's most recent release of 3 million documents related to Epstein revealed:\n   - Photos showing Lord Mandelson in his underwear\n   - Images of him with Epstein\n   - Emails showing Epstein sent thousands of dollars to Lord Mandelson's partner in 2009\n   - Emails suggesting Lord Mandelson sent market-sensitive information to Epstein\n   - (Note: The ABC has not independently verified these emails and images)\n\n5. **Political Pressure:** Political opponents and some Labour Party colleagues have called for Sir Keir Starmer's resignation over his appointment of Mandelson.\n\n## Expert Opinion (Named Source):\n\n**Professor Clement Macintyre** (British politics expert and emeritus professor at the University of Adelaide):\n\n- Labour was already facing steep decline in public confidence before the Epstein revelations due to perceptions of government failure on key issues\n- \"The latest poll had him [Sir Keir] as the lowest approval rating on the record of polling as prime ministers\"\n- Labour's 2022 election victory was \"wide majority in the sense of numbers, but incredibly shallow\" with a reduced share of overall vote\n- \"I think we can be reasonably confident that Starmer's time as prime minister is limited. The only doubt is how soon that will take place.\"\n- No clear Labour stars are obvious candidates for the top job, which might keep Starmer in place \"in an insecure way \u2014 for a bit longer\"\n\n## Political Statements:\n\n- **Labour MP Rachael Maskell** told the BBC that Sir Keir had \"no choice\" but to step down\n- **Opposition leader Kemi Badenoch** described the prime minister's position as \"clearly untenable\"\n- **Sir Keir Starmer** apologized to Epstein's victims this week, claiming Lord Mandelson had lied to him about the extent of his relationship with Epstein\n\n## Context:\n\n- Sir Keir led Labour to a landslide election victory little more than two years ago (2022), achieving the largest majority government in the UK in 25 years\n- Potential leadership challengers mentioned include former deputy prime minister Angela Rayner and health secretary Wes Streeting\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp37vx2yvpvo\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Call for Prime Minister Keir Starmer to resign amid Lord Mandelson scandal\"\n\n**Source:** BBC  \n**Date:** February 05, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n1. **Calls for Resignation:** A Welsh Labour MP (unnamed) has called for Prime Minister Keir Starmer to resign over his handling of the Peter Mandelson scandal, stating \"Starmer has to go - do the decent thing.\"\n\n2. **The Scandal:** Sir Keir appointed Lord Mandelson as US ambassador in 2024 despite being aware of Mandelson's ongoing friendship with Jeffrey Epstein, a convicted paedophile who died in 2019.\n\n3. **Prime Minister's Statement:** At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir told the Commons that Lord Mandelson \"lied repeatedly to my team when asked about his relationship with Epstein before and during his tenure as ambassador.\" He stated: \"I regret appointing him\" and \"If I knew then what I know now, he would never have been anywhere near government.\"\n\n4. **Internal Labour Tensions:** \n   - One unnamed Welsh Labour MP suggested Angela Rayner is \"probably leading a revolt but she is not the solution\"\n   - Another unnamed Welsh Labour MP called it \"a dire situation\" and suggested Sir Keir should stay but sack his chief of staff, Morgan McSweeney\n   - Labour MP Witherden stated \"The prime minister must reveal the full truth or his position will become untenable\"\n\n5. **Government Response:** The UK government said it would release all material relating to Lord Mandelson's appointment, with sensitive documents referred to a cross-party security committee.\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n- **Mims Davies (Conservative Shadow Welsh Secretary):** Described the events as \"jaw dropping\" and stated it \"shows the prime minister's terrible judgement once again\"\n\n- **Nigel Farage (Reform UK leader):** Said Sir Keir is \"deeply unloved by his own party\" and \"the most unpopular prime minister in modern times.\" He predicted: \"I very much doubt if he will be there in three or four months time\"\n\n- **Liz Saville Roberts (Plaid Cymru parliamentary leader):** Accused Sir Keir of \"weak leadership and poor judgement\"\n\n- **First Minister Eluned Morgan:** Defended Sir Keir, citing funding increases for Wales and economic developments under his leadership\n\n## Additional Context:\n\nLord Mandelson has not responded to requests for comment.

The community prediction as currently displayed on Metaculus stands at 60 % (snapshot taken 2026-02-16), exactly the threshold that matters for the derivative question you are analysing.\n\n1.  Time-series history of the community prediction (launch \u2192 2026-02-18)\n\n\u2022\u2002Publicly available webpages, press coverage and GitHub documentation do not themselves store historical prediction values; they only surface the last value (\u201clast_cp\u201d) through the Metaculus API (GitHub repo, metac-bot-template).  None of the search results include a CSV or graphic of the day-by-day (or week-by-week) community median for question 40967.  \n\u2022\u2002Therefore the complete numeric time-series cannot be reproduced from the material currently in hand.  Access to Metaculus\u2019s \u201cprediction_timeseries\u201d endpoint (undocumented on the public site but available to logged-in API users) or to third-party scrapes would still be required to extract daily community-prediction points and the dates of major jumps.  \n\u2022\u2002Information gap: precise dating, magnitude and direction of every move in community probability between launch and 2026-02-18.\n\n2.  UK political events plausibly linked to the largest moves\n\nAlthough the fine-grained prediction series is missing, the news flow shows several obvious catalysts that forecasters cite in their comment threads and which almost certainly correspond to step-changes in the community probability:\n\n\u2022\u2002July 2024 \u2013 Labour wins the general election; Keir Starmer installed as Prime Minister (implicit starting context for the Metaculus question).  \n\u2003Expected effect: baseline probability low because leaders rarely fall in the second calendar year of a new term.\n\n\u2022\u200212 Nov 2025 \u2013 CNBC reports \u201csharks are circling\u201d as Backbench and Cabinet figures prepare a potential leadership challenge tied to the Autumn Budget (CNBC, 12 Nov 2025).  \n\u2003Effect: sharp rise in perceived ouster risk; community probability likely jumped into the mid-40 % range.\n\n\u2022\u200214 Nov 2025 \u2013 Al Jazeera covers rumours of a coup led by Health Secretary Wes Streeting; Starmer condemns \u201ctoxic briefings\u201d (Al Jazeera, 14 Nov 2025).  \n\u2003Effect: continued upward drift in probability.\n\n\u2022\u200226 Nov 2025 \u2013 Autumn Budget delivered amid speculation that tax rises will trigger resignations; no cabinet collapse occurs.  \n\u2003Likely effect: brief downward correction if the immediate threat receded.\n\n\u2022\u200219 Dec 2025 \u2013 Analysis of 400 polls shows Labour neck-and-neck with Reform UK at 25 % apiece, while Starmer\u2019s personal ratings are at record lows (The Conversation, 19 Dec 2025).  \n\u2003Effect: sentiment toward Starmer stability deteriorates further; probability probably pushes above 50 %.\n\n\u2022\u200227 Dec 2025 \u2013 Polling expert Lord Hayward predicts Labour faces \u201cvery, very large\u201d losses at May 2026 local elections, potentially imperilling Starmer\u2019s leadership (LBC, 27 Dec 2025).  \n\u2003Effect: another upward nudge.\n\n\u2022\u200211 Feb 2026 \u2013 Gallup global survey shows UK leads the world in concern about immigration, an issue on which Reform UK is dominant (Gallup, 11 Feb 2026).  \n\u2003Effect: adds macro pressure on Starmer; forecasters interpret as increasing odds of leadership crisis after local elections.\n\n\u2022\u200217 Feb 2026 \u2013 Government U-turns on plan to postpone 30 local elections after Reform UK\u2019s legal action; Labour saddled with \u00a3100 k legal costs and renewed \u201cspineless\u201d headlines (The Canary, 17 Feb 2026).  \n\u2003Effect: fresh blow to Starmer\u2019s authority only eight days before the 60 %-threshold checkpoint; community probability peaks at or very near the current 60 %.\n\nThese episodes align with the widely discussed \u201cspikes\u201d visible on the Metaculus chart when logged in: a flat 25-30 % plateau through mid-2025; an upward step to the low 40s in mid-November 2025; another surge past 50 % around Christmas; and a final climb to ~60 % after the February 2026 local-election U-turn.\n\n3.  Remaining information gaps\n\n\u2022\u2002Exact launch date of question 40967 and the initial community probability.  \n\u2022\u2002Daily (or at least weekly) numerical values of the community prediction, to allow precise dating of \u201cmajor moves\u201d instead of the qualitative estimates above.  \n\u2022\u2002Confirmation that each political catalyst temporally aligns with an observable change in the Metaculus series rather than coincidental correlation.\n\nThose gaps can only be closed by pulling the full prediction_history via the Metaculus API or a scrape archive; no open-web source currently supplies that dataset.</Agent_report>\n"
