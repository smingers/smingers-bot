The methodology includes:\n\n1. **Pollster weighting by accuracy:** Each polling firm receives a score based on their historical accuracy in predicting actual election results. More accurate pollsters have greater influence on the trendline.\n\n2. **Frequency adjustment:** To prevent high-frequency pollsters from dominating the average through volume alone, weights are adjusted when firms publish multiple polls within a 10-day window. The total weight is distributed across those polls to ensure weekly trackers don't overpower less frequent releases.\n\n3. **Statistical noise handling:** A regression model reduces the influence of outlier polls by measuring deviation from the trendline. Polls that deviate significantly (>15 points from the trend) receive zero influence.\n\n**Note:** This article appears to be a methodology description page rather than containing specific polling data, statistics, or opinions about Keir Starmer's political prospects. The extracted content does not include actual polling numbers or analysis relevant to the forecasting question beyond explaining how their polling averages are calculated.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.bbc.com/news/live/cgq4zd0lx12t\">\n# Summary of BBC News Article on Andy Burnham and Labour Leadership\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n**Andy Burnham's Statements:**\n- Burnham confirmed to the Telegraph that he has been contacted by Labour MPs \"throughout the summer\" about returning to Westminster to lead Labour and replace Starmer as PM\n- He stated that a potential leadership challenge is \"more a decision for those people [Labour MPs] than it is for me\"\n- He repeated this line in interviews with BBC Manchester\n- Burnham emphasized the need for a \"strong plan\" to beat Reform UK as the priority\n- He said people in north-west England \"don't believe the government is on their side\"\n\n**Political Context:**\n- Burnham is currently the mayor of Greater Manchester and is not an MP\n- He has been mayor for 10 years\n- The interviews occurred in the days before a crucial Labour party conference for Starmer\n- According to the BBC, \"In government, there is frustration and no small amount of bafflement that Burnham has decided to make these interventions now\"\n\n**Barriers to Leadership Challenge:**\n- Burnham would need to become an MP by winning a by-election and resign as mayor before challenging Starmer\n- No by-elections have been called currently\n- Uncertainty exists over whether he would be selected as a candidate if an opportunity arose\n- He would need backing from 80 Labour MPs to challenge Starmer\n- Burnham previously failed in two Labour leadership campaigns: lost to Ed Miliband in 2010 (came fourth) and to Jeremy Corbyn in 2015 (came second with Corbyn winning almost 60% of the vote)\n\n**Burnham's Response to Questions:**\n- When asked if he would act if 80 MPs offered support, he declined to answer hypotheticals\n- He denied undermining Starmer's leadership\n- He stated he will not \"toe a line and keep quiet\" when being critical\n\n**Public Reaction:**\n- One caller to BBC Radio Manchester said Burnham should stay as mayor where he's doing a \"great job\" and that \"now is definitely not the time\" for a leadership bid\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c9v124znrgmo\">\n# Summary of BBC News Article (November 12, 2025)\n\n## Key Facts and Events:\n\n- **Date of Article:** November 12, 2025\n- **Main Subject:** Wes Streeting (Health Secretary) denies plotting against PM Keir Starmer after leadership challenge claims emerged\n\n- **Timeline:** On Tuesday evening (November 11), friends of Sir Keir told news outlets his job might be under \"immediate threat\" and expressed suspicion of Streeting's leadership ambitions\n\n- **Leadership Challenge Mechanics:** \n  - Challengers need support of 20% of Labour MPs to trigger a leadership contest\n  - Currently requires 80-81 nominations (article states both figures)\n\n## Direct Quotes and Statements:\n\n**Wes Streeting:**\n- Called suggestions he's challenging for leadership \"self-defeating nonsense\"\n- Said he could \"not see any circumstances under which I would do that to our prime minister\"\n- Called the culture in No 10 \"toxic\"\n- Urged Sir Keir to sack whoever is briefing the media\n- Said: \"Yes\" when asked if the PM should sack those responsible, adding \"But he's got to find them first\"\n\n**Other Named Sources:**\n- **Jo White MP** (chair of Red Wall Labour backbench group): Said this was \"neither the time or the place\" for briefings about a leadership challenge\n- **One minister:** \"He will fight this...
