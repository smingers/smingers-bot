## (a) Source Analysis

**AskNews Articles (February 2026):**

1. **La Razón (Feb 18, 2026):** Reports on AMOC collapse risks and Iceland's 2025 record heat. Expert: Hildigunnur Thorsteinsson (Iceland Met Office Director). Factual: Iceland 2025 was warmest on record (+1.1°C above baseline). Opinion: Future AMOC collapse scenarios. Quality: Medium - reputable source but focuses on long-term risks, not immediate SST records.

2. **ThePrint/AFP/DH.be (Feb 17-18, 2026):** Multiple sources reporting 2025 climate data. Factual: 2025 was 1.19-1.44°C above baseline, oceans absorbed record heat, Arctic sea ice at record low in March 2025. Quality: High - consistent facts across multiple outlets citing NASA, WMO, NOAA.

3. **Meteo.it/MeteoWeb (Feb 17-18, 2026):** Reports on potential El Niño development. Factual: NOAA estimates 50-60% chance of El Niño by late summer 2026, currently in weakening La Niña. Quality: Medium - cites official sources but focuses on Pacific, not North Atlantic.

4. **Time Magazine (Jan 9, 2026):** Reports 2025 ocean records. Factual: Oceans absorbed 23 zettajoules more energy than 2024, global SST third highest on record. Quality: High - peer-reviewed study in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences.

5. **Nature (Jan 21, 2026):** Paleoclimate study on Last Glacial Maximum. Not relevant to current SST forecasting.

6. **RFI/Proplanta (Jan-Oct 2025):** Reports on North Sea and Baltic Sea warming. Factual: North Sea 2025 was warmest on record (11.6°C), 55-day marine heatwave. Quality: High - German Federal Maritime Agency data. **Critical limitation:** North Sea is subset of broader North Atlantic domain used for resolution.

**Key factual findings:**
- 2025 set multiple ocean heat records globally
- North Atlantic had "warmest SSTs on record for the time of year" in January 2026 (Copernicus)
- But 2026 overall tracking "lower than 2025" per question background
- No daily records set yet in 2026 through Feb 17
- La Niña weakening, potential El Niño later in 2026

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Multiple sources confirm 2025 was record-breaking year for ocean heat** (Time, ThePrint, AFP, BioBioChile citing peer-reviewed study). However, this is historical context - the question asks about Feb-Apr 2026.
- **Copernicus (Feb 9, 2026) reports parts of North Atlantic had warmest January SSTs on record** - but question background states 2026 "lower than 2025 overall." This suggests regional variation, not domain-wide records.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Agent report confirms no daily records set through Feb 17, 2026** - This is direct evidence that 28 days into the resolution window, no records have occurred. With 72 days remaining (Mar 1-Apr 30), this reduces probability but doesn't eliminate it.
- **La Niña weakening, neutral conditions expected Feb-Apr 2026** (multiple sources) - La Niña typically suppresses North Atlantic SST. Transition to neutral could allow warming, but El Niño unlikely until late 2026, outside resolution window.

**Weak Evidence:**
- North Sea/Baltic Sea records - These are regional subsets, not the full OISST North Atlantic domain (0-60°N, 80°W-0°E).
- AMOC concerns - Long-term structural issue, not relevant to 2-month SST forecast.

**Evidence weighing for CP movement:**
The critical question is whether new information in the next 10 days will cause forecasters to update from 20% to >20%.

- **Against CP increase:** No records set in 28 days, 2026 tracking below 2025, time decay reducing probability
- **For CP increase:** Copernicus January warmth in parts of North Atlantic, potential late-winter/early-spring warming spike, 72 days still remain

The evidence is mixed but slightly tilted toward stability or downward drift.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 10 days (Feb 18-28, 2026)

**If timeframe halved to 5 days (Feb 18-23):**
Probability of CP >20% would decrease to ~20-25%. Less time for new SST data to arrive, less forecaster activity, higher inertia at current 20% level.

**If timeframe doubled to 20 days (Feb 18-Mar 10):**
Probability of CP >20% would increase to ~40-45%. More daily SST readings, more time for potential warming signals, March typically warmer than February, increased chance of forecaster updates.

**Current 10-day window:** Represents ~10 new daily data points. If these show continued sub-record readings, CP likely stays ≤20%. If warming trend emerges, CP could rise to 21-24%.

## (d) Justification

**Starting point:** Outside view base rate of 30% for CP >20% on Feb 28.

**Key factors shifting prediction:**

1. **Knife-edge starting position (Strong factor, neutral):** CP at exactly 20.00% means any movement above threshold resolves Yes. However, this also means forecasters have anchored at this round number, creating stickiness.

2. **Time decay without records (Moderate factor, downward):** 28 days elapsed without records. Each day reduces probability slightly. Natural drift should be toward 19-20%, not upward.

3. **Copernicus January warmth vs. overall 2026 trend (Moderate factor, conflicting):** Regional records in January suggest potential, but overall 2026 below 2025 suggests records unlikely. This creates uncertainty rather than clear directional signal.

4. **Limited new information expected (Moderate factor, toward stability):** Only ~10 daily data points will arrive. Absent dramatic warming, insufficient to trigger major CP movement.

5. **Forecaster behavior at extremes (Moderate factor, downward):** Questions at 15-25% probability range show stickiness. Large movements require compelling new evidence.

**Calibration:**
The outside view of 30% seems slightly optimistic given:
- Downward pressure from time decay
- No records yet in 28 days
- Limited time for major information arrival
- Forecaster inertia at round number

However, maintaining some upside probability because:
- 72 days still remain in resolution window (significant time)
- Copernicus reported regional January records
- Late February/March can see rapid warming
- Small probability of forecaster overreaction to minor positive news

**Adjustment:** Reduce from 30% to 25-27% range to account for downward bias.

Probability calibration:

Starting from outside view of 30%, I adjust downward to 26% based on:
- Stronger evidence for stability/decline (no records in 28 days, time decay)
- Weaker evidence for increase (regional warmth doesn't guarantee domain-wide records)
- Forecaster psychology favoring round number anchoring
- Asymmetric information flow (continued sub-record readings more likely than sudden spike)

The 26% reflects:
- ~25% chance CP stays exactly at 20.00%
- ~49% chance CP declines to 18-19%
- ~26% chance CP rises to 21-25%

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Metaculus community prediction for "North Atlantic daily SST record before May 2026" exceed 20.00% on Feb 28, 2026? Currently at exactly 20.00% on Feb 16.

2. **Base rate:** Outside view established 30% probability based on Metaculus CP stability patterns for low-probability questions over 10-day windows.

3. **Consistency:** "26 out of 100 times, the CP moves above 20.00% by Feb 28." This aligns with modest downward pressure from time decay and lack of records, balanced against remaining uncertainty.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - No daily records set in first 28 days of resolution window (factual, strong)
   - 2026 SSTs tracking below 2025 levels overall (factual per question background, strong)
   - Copernicus reported regional January warmth in parts of North Atlantic (factual, moderate)
   - 72 days remain in resolution window (factual, moderate)
   - CP at exactly 20.00%, a round number anchor point (factual, moderate)

5. **Blind spot:** Late February sees unexpected warming spike in daily OISST data, even without breaking records yet. Forecasters interpret this as momentum signal and update to 22-24%, making my forecast wrong. Probability of this scenario: ~15%, which would shift my prediction to ~35-40%.

6. **Status quo:** Current trend is sub-record readings continuing. Low volatility in SST patterns over 10-day windows. Status quo strongly favors CP staying at or below 20%, supporting my 26% prediction for >20%.

Probability: 26%
