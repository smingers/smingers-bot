## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Metaculus community prediction stability over 10-day periods:**
   - Most relevant for this meta-question
   - CP currently at exactly 20% (the threshold)
   - Question: Will CP move >20% in 10 days (Feb 18-28)?

2. **North Atlantic SST record-breaking frequency in Feb-Apr period:**
   - 2023-2024 saw unprecedented warming
   - 2025 set multiple daily records
   - 2026 started high but below 2025 levels
   - Relevant for understanding underlying event probability

3. **Metaculus CP movement on binary questions near 50% vs near extremes:**
   - CP at 20% suggests crowd sees low probability
   - Questions at extreme probabilities (10-30% or 70-90%) tend to be stickier
   - Large movements require significant new information

**Most suitable reference class:** Metaculus CP stability for questions with low baseline probabilities (15-25%) over short timeframes when underlying conditions are relatively stable.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 10 days (February 18-28, 2026)

**Current situation (as of Feb 18):**
- CP is exactly at 20% threshold
- No daily records set yet in 2026 (through Feb 17)
- 2026 SSTs are "high but lower than 2025"
- Copernicus reports parts of North Atlantic had "warmest SSTs on record for the time of year" in January 2026

**What could move CP >20% in next 10 days:**
1. Daily SST data showing 2026 exceeding 2025 records
2. Weather forecasts predicting anomalous warmth
3. Expert commentary on unusual patterns
4. Natural volatility in forecaster participation

**What would keep CP ≤20%:**
1. Continued sub-record SST readings
2. Cooling trends in late February
3. Forecaster inertia at current level

**Historical pattern:** The underlying question resolves based on Feb 1 - Apr 30, 2026 period. With 2.5 months remaining and no records set yet, the crowd's 20% probability seems calibrated to:
- Low but non-negligible chance of March-April warming spike
- Recognition that 2023-2025 saw unprecedented patterns
- Uncertainty about whether shipping emission effects will continue

## (d) Justification

The CP sits exactly at the threshold (20%), creating a knife-edge situation. Several factors suggest stability:

1. **Underlying event probability appears stable:** No records set through Feb 17, and the agent report confirms 2026 is tracking below 2025. Without dramatic new SST data in the next 10 days, forecasters have little reason to update significantly.

2. **Time decay favors stability:** With each passing day without a record, the probability of "record before May 2026" should gradually decline. However, 72 days remain (Mar 1 - Apr 30), so this effect is modest.

3. **Metaculus CP inertia:** Community predictions on binary questions tend to be sticky, especially at extreme probabilities. Moving from 20% to >20% requires net bullish updates from active forecasters.

4. **Information flow:** The critical data (daily OISST values) updates with 1-2 day lag. Between Feb 18-28, forecasters will see approximately 10 more daily data points. If these continue showing sub-record values, CP likely stays ≤20% or drifts lower.

5. **Copernicus ambiguity:** While Copernicus reported "warmest SSTs on record for the time of year" in parts of North Atlantic for January, the agent report and question background state 2026 is "lower than 2025." This suggests regional variation - some areas at records, but the specific OISST domain (0-60°N, 80°W-0°E) used for resolution is not setting daily records.

6. **Forecaster behavior:** At exactly 20%, some forecasters may have anchored to this round number. Small positive news might push to 21-22%, but absent dramatic developments, large movements seem unlikely.

**Key uncertainty:** If late February sees a sudden warming spike in the daily data (even without breaking records yet), forecasters might increase probability based on momentum. However, current trajectory suggests continued sub-record readings.

## Outside view calibration:

The question asks whether CP will be **higher than** 20.00%, not equal to. Starting from exactly 20%, the CP must move to at least 20.01% to resolve Yes.

**Calibration factors:**

1. **Base rate of small CP movements:** On Metaculus, CPs frequently fluctuate by 1-3 percentage points over 10-day periods due to normal forecaster activity, even without major news. However, questions at extreme probabilities (under 30%) tend to be stickier.

2. **Directional bias:** Given that time is passing without records being set, the natural drift should be slightly downward (reducing probability), not upward. This creates asymmetry.

3. **Threshold precision:** The CP is at exactly 20.00%, which is a psychologically round number. Forecasters may cluster around this value. Moving above requires net positive updates.

4. **Information expected:** ~10 more daily SST readings will arrive. If all continue sub-record, CP likely stays flat or drifts to 19-20%. If any show warming toward record levels, CP could rise to 21-23%.

5. **Historical upset rate:** In climate forecasting, short-term predictions based on established trends are generally reliable. The pattern of "2026 below 2025" has held for 6+ weeks. Sudden reversals are possible but not typical.

**Probability assessment:**

- Probability CP stays at exactly 20.00%: ~25%
- Probability CP moves down to 18-19%: ~40%
- Probability CP moves up to 21-25%: ~30%
- Probability CP moves up significantly (>25%): ~5%

Therefore, probability CP > 20.00% on Feb 28: ~35%

However, this seems slightly high given the downward bias from time decay and lack of record-setting so far. Adjusting for:
- Metaculus CP stickiness at round numbers
- Slight downward pressure from ongoing sub-record readings
- Limited time for major new information

**Final calibration:** 28-32% range seems appropriate, with 30% as central estimate.
