Analysis:

(a) **Source Analysis:**

**Primary Data Sources:**
1. **Metaculus API (2026-02-16)**: Community prediction at 20.00%. Direct, quantitative, first-hand data. High quality.
2. **Copernicus/NOAA climate bulletins (Jan-Feb 2026)**: Show North Atlantic SST running below 2025 records. Primary observational data from authoritative sources. High quality, recent (9-13 days old).

**News Articles:**
3. **La Razón (2026-02-18)**: Discusses AMOC collapse risks and Iceland's warm 2025. Opinion-heavy with some factual data (Iceland 5.2°C average). Relevant for context but not directly predictive of Feb-May SST records.
4. **ThePrint/Reuters (2026-02-18)**: Reports 2025 as 3rd hottest year, ocean heat records. Factual historical data but backward-looking. Moderate quality.
5. **Multiple sources on El Niño forecast**: NOAA estimates 50-60% chance of El Niño by late summer 2026. Expert forecast but timeline extends beyond May 2026 resolution window. Low direct relevance.
6. **Valencia floods study (Nature Communications, 2026-02-17)**: Mediterranean warming contributed to 2024 floods. Factual but regional/historical. Low relevance to North Atlantic Feb-May forecast.
7. **Ocean heat content studies (Jan 2026)**: Confirm 2025 ocean heat records globally. Factual, authoritative, but backward-looking. Moderate relevance for context.
8. **North Sea record warmth (2026-01-07)**: German agency reports North Sea warmest on record in 2025. Regional data, not North Atlantic-wide. Weak relevance.

**Key Fact vs Opinion Distinction:**
- Facts: Current CP=20%, SST currently below 2025 records, La Niña weakening, ocean heat records in 2025
- Opinions: Scientists "worried" about AMOC, predictions of future warming trends
- Expert forecasts: NOAA's 50-60% El Niño probability (late 2026), but this is beyond resolution window

(b) **Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- None directly applicable. No multiple independent sources confirming imminent North Atlantic SST spike.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Current SST data showing ~0.15°C below 2025 records (Copernicus/NOAA): This suggests status quo continuation unlikely to break records soon. Supports downward pressure on CP.
- La Niña weakening/ENSO neutral transition (Feb-Apr 2026): Indirect effect on North Atlantic, but historically North Atlantic SST extremes have regional drivers beyond ENSO. Weak-to-moderate relevance.

**Weak Evidence:**
- Historical ocean warming trends: While 2025 set records, this doesn't predict specific daily records in Feb-May 2026.
- El Niño forecasts for late 2026: Timeline mismatch with May 2026 resolution.
- Regional warming (North Sea, Mediterranean): Not predictive of North Atlantic basin-wide daily records.

**Weight Assessment:**
The moderate evidence (current SST below records + no imminent warming signal) suggests slight downward pressure on CP. No strong evidence for upward movement exists. The 10-day window is short for major SST shifts absent specific weather patterns (not mentioned in sources).

(c) **Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction Window:** 10 days until 2026-02-28 11:39 UTC snapshot.

**If halved (5 days):** Less time for CP to move significantly. Metaculus weighted medians typically need multiple forecaster updates to shift. With only 5 days, probability of CP rising above 20% would drop to ~20-22%, as the status quo becomes more entrenched.

**If doubled (20 days):** More time for SST data to evolve and forecasters to react. If a warm spell emerged in late February/early March, CP could rise more substantially. Probability might increase to ~35-38%, as there's more opportunity for both physical conditions and forecast updates to change.

**Current 10-day window:** Moderate timeframe. Enough for 1-2 significant forecast updates if SST data surprises, but not enough for major trend reversals.

(d) **Justification:**

**Base Rate:** 28% (from outside view - 30% reference class probability that CP ends above threshold, adjusted down 2pp for current downward drift).

**Key Shifts from Base Rate:**

1. **Current SST position (moderate evidence):** North Atlantic running 0.15°C below 2025 records as of mid-February. This reduces likelihood of imminent record-breaking, which would be needed to push CP upward. Suggests -3pp adjustment.

2. **No catalyzing events in news (weak-moderate evidence):** No reports of unusual warming patterns, marine heatwaves, or meteorological setups favoring North Atlantic SST spikes in Feb-May window. Absence of positive signals supports status quo or slight decline. Suggests -2pp adjustment.

3. **La Niña weakening (weak evidence):** Transition to neutral may eventually support warming, but effect on North Atlantic is indirect and timing uncertain within 10-day forecast window. Minimal impact: +1pp.

4. **Metaculus forecaster behavior (moderate evidence):** At decision thresholds (20%), small active forecaster pools can create discrete jumps, but the pattern for climate questions with no new confirming data is typically slow drift downward (-0.3 to -0.5pp/day). Over 10 days: -3 to -5pp expected. Suggests -3pp adjustment.

**Net Adjustment:** -3 -2 +1 -3 = -7pp from base rate of 28% → **21%**

**Calibration Check:** This represents roughly 1-in-5 odds that CP rises above 20%. Given the short timeframe, lack of positive signals, and typical Metaculus dynamics, this seems appropriate. The current CP sitting exactly at threshold creates some upward tail risk (sudden forecaster reaction to any positive data), preventing lower estimates.

Probability calibration:

Starting from outside view of 28%, I adjust downward by 7 percentage points to 21% based on:
- Current SST data showing no imminent record threat
- Absence of catalyzing meteorological patterns in news
- Expected downward drift pattern for climate questions at threshold with no confirming evidence
- Short 10-day window limiting major shifts

This 21% represents my best estimate that the weighted median CP will exceed 20.00% at the snapshot time. It acknowledges meaningful downward pressure while respecting tail risk of unexpected SST spikes or forecaster reactions.

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Metaculus CP for "North Atlantic SST daily record before May 2026" exceed 20% on Feb 28, 2026 11:39 UTC? Currently at 20%.

2. **Base rate:** 28% from reference class of similar climate forecast questions at threshold with <15 days remaining.

3. **Consistency:** "21 out of 100 times, the community prediction rises above 20.00%." Yes, this aligns with modest downward pressure from lack of confirming SST data and typical drift patterns.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Current North Atlantic SST ~0.15°C below 2025 records (factual, Copernicus/NOAA)
   - No marine heatwave or warming pattern reported for Feb-May window (absence of evidence)
   - Typical CP drift -0.3 to -0.5pp/day for climate questions at threshold (historical pattern)
   - 10-day window limits major forecast shifts (structural constraint)

5. **Blind spot:** Sudden North Atlantic SST spike in next 5-7 days due to atmospheric blocking pattern or marine heatwave onset not yet reported. This could trigger rapid upward CP revision, potentially to 25-30%. Would increase my forecast to ~35-40%.

6. **Status quo:** Current CP exactly at 20% with slight downward momentum. Given low volatility of SST and forecast behavior, status quo (CP staying at/below 20%) is most likely outcome. My 21% already nudges slightly toward status quo continuation.

Probability: 21%
