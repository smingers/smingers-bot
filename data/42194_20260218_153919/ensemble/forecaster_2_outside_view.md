Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Climate Reanalyzer (NOAA OISST data platform):**
- Technical documentation of the data source for the underlying question
- High quality, authoritative source (NOAA dataset)
- Dated to current operations (2026), but is a platform description rather than current data
- Key fact: Data has 1-2 day lag and is preliminary for two weeks
- Caveat provided: "apparent record high or low values in OISST should be considered with caution"

**Copernicus ACP Study (2024):**
- Peer-reviewed scientific article on shipping emission reductions
- High quality, published in Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics
- Published 2024, analyzing 2020 regulation impacts
- Key facts: 80% reduction in shipping SO₂ emissions, contributing 0.13 W/m² forcing
- Expert interpretation: May explain "part of the rapid jump in global temperatures"

**NPR Article (August 2024):**
- Journalistic coverage of ocean warming
- Moderate quality, quotes multiple named experts
- Dated August 2024, discussing 15-month record streak starting April 2023
- Expert opinions from Dessler (Texas A&M), Gettelman (PNNL), others
- Dessler's key opinion: "My guess is, in the end, it's just going to be internal variability"

**Copernicus Climate Report (February 2026):**
- Official climate monitoring report
- High quality, authoritative EU climate service
- Dated February 9, 2026 - very recent and relevant
- **Critical fact: "A large region of the subtropical and northeast North Atlantic, including the Norwegian Sea, had the warmest SSTs on record for the time of year" in January 2026**
- January 2026 SST globally was 4th-highest for January

**Climate Central Briefing (January 2026):**
- Climate science communication organization
- Good quality, cites official data sources
- Dated for January 2026
- January 2026 was 5th warmest globally
- Expert opinion from Dr. Zachary Labe on winter patterns

**NOAA NCEI Report (February 2026):**
- Official U.S. government climate report
- High quality, authoritative
- Dated February 10, 2026
- January 2026 was 5th-warmest January globally
- No specific North Atlantic SST daily data provided

**Agent Report:**
- Synthesizes available information
- Key findings: CP on 2026-02-16 was exactly 20%, 2026 SSTs "started out high but have so far been lower than during 2025"
- Identifies critical gap: actual daily SST values for 2026 through Feb 17 not available in sources
- Conclusion: 2026 values are "nearing but not surpassing" standing daily records as of Feb 17

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Metaculus community predictions on binary climate questions near 20% threshold**
   - Suitability: Moderate - captures platform dynamics but not specific to this question type
   
2. **Daily SST record-breaking events in North Atlantic during Feb-Apr periods**
   - Suitability: High - directly relevant to the underlying question
   - Historical context: 2023-2025 saw unprecedented warming, with 2025 setting numerous daily records
   - 2026 has started warm but below 2025 levels

3. **Metaculus CP movements over 10-day periods for questions with recent data updates**
   - Suitability: High - directly relevant to the meta-question
   - Need to consider: How responsive is the community to daily SST updates?

**Chosen reference class:** Metaculus CP movements on climate questions with ongoing data releases, specifically when current conditions are tracking below recent records but remain elevated.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 10 days (from 2026-02-18 to 2026-02-28)

**Key temporal factors:**
- Current CP: exactly 20.00% as of 2026-02-16
- Question asks if CP will be >20% on 2026-02-28
- Daily SST data updates with 1-2 day lag
- Approximately 8-10 more daily SST readings will become available before resolution

**Historical patterns:**
- 2025 set daily records throughout Feb-Apr period
- 2026 has started "high" but "lower than 2025" (per question background)
- Copernicus reports January 2026 had record SSTs in parts of North Atlantic
- Agent report confirms no new daily records set through Feb 17, 2026

**Pattern interpretation:**
- If 2026 continues tracking below 2025 daily values, CP likely stays at or below 20%
- Any single day exceeding the 2025 record would immediately resolve the underlying question as "Yes" and likely spike the CP
- The window for records (Feb 1 - Apr 30) is long, but we're already 17 days in with no records yet

## (d) Justification

The meta-question asks whether the Metaculus community prediction will rise above 20% by February 28, 2026. Currently, the CP stands at exactly 20.00% as of February 16.

**Factors favoring CP staying at or below 20%:**
1. 2026 SSTs are tracking below 2025 levels through mid-February despite being elevated
2. No daily records have been set in the first 17 days of the resolution window
3. The question background explicitly states 2026 has been "lower than during 2025"
4. The community has already incorporated this information into the 20% baseline
5. Only 10 days remain until the meta-question resolves, limiting time for dramatic shifts

**Factors favoring CP rising above 20%:**
1. Copernicus reported record SSTs in parts of North Atlantic for January 2026
2. The resolution window extends to April 30, giving substantial time for records
3. Climate volatility and natural variability could produce sudden spikes
4. Any single day breaking a record immediately changes the underlying question outcome

**Critical uncertainty:**
The actual daily SST values for February 18-28 are unknown. However, given:
- The established pattern of 2026 tracking below 2025
- The community's current assessment at 20%
- The short timeframe (10 days) for new information to emerge and shift beliefs
- The typical inertia in community predictions absent dramatic new data

The most likely scenario is that the CP remains at or near 20%, potentially drifting slightly up or down based on daily readings but unlikely to cross the threshold absent a clear record-breaking day.

## Outside view calibration:

**Tethering to available figures:**
- Current CP: 20.00% (exact threshold)
- This represents the community's aggregate assessment incorporating all available data through Feb 16

**Probability considerations:**
- The question requires CP > 20%, not ≥ 20%
- Even a small increase to 20.5% or 21% would satisfy the condition
- However, the CP has been stable at 20% (no historical trajectory available to assess volatility)

**Rate of upsets in climate forecasting:**
- Climate variables can show sudden shifts due to weather patterns
- However, 17 days of data already incorporated suggests the pattern is somewhat established
- The 2-week preliminary data period means most recent values are still subject to revision

**Calibration reasoning:**
Given the CP is exactly at the threshold, the question essentially asks: "Will any new information in the next 10 days cause the community to increase their probability estimate?"

The base rate for "no change" or "slight decrease" seems higher than "increase" because:
1. The trend through Feb 17 supports the current 20% assessment
2. Absent a clear record-breaking event, incremental data unlikely to shift beliefs significantly
3. The community has already priced in the elevated but sub-record conditions

However, there's non-trivial probability of:
- A warm spike in late February pushing one day above the 2025 record
- Community updating upward in anticipation of March-April warming
- New forecasts or expert commentary shifting sentiment

I estimate approximately 30-35% probability that the CP rises above 20% by February 28.
