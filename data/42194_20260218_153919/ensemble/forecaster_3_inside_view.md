Analysis:
### 1) Paraphrase / alignment with resolution criteria
This resolves **Yes** if the **Metaculus community prediction** for Q41595 is **strictly > 20.00%** at **2026-02-28 11:39 UTC** (or equals the target’s resolved value if it resolves earlier).

### (a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; date; fact vs opinion)
- **The Watchers (2026-02-15)**: Reports NOAA/CPC diagnostics that La Niña is weakening; probabilistic ENSO-neutral transition (e.g., ~60% Feb–Apr). *Quality:* medium (secondary reporting of NOAA). *Relevance:* indirect (Pacific → global teleconnections). Mostly factual summary of NOAA outlook.
- **Rutgers RU-COOL interface (live data page)**: Data portal for SST imagery, no analysis. *Quality:* good as a data source, but provides no direct facts here. *Relevance:* minimal.
- **NOAA/NWS Ocean.weather RTOFS interface**: Model visualization portal; no extracted quantitative claim here. *Quality:* good tool, but no direct evidence provided. *Relevance:* minimal.
- **TIME (2026-01-09)**: General “oceans were hotter than ever in 2025” discussion; cites ocean heat content and global SST context. *Quality:* medium-high journalism; facts likely sourced; *relevance:* background, not specific to North Atlantic daily-record mechanics.
- **Nature (2026-01-21) paleoceanography + EurekAlert summary (2026-01-21)**: LGM circulation findings; some expert quotes about AMOC vulnerability (opinions). *Quality:* Nature high, EurekAlert medium; *relevance:* very indirect for Feb–May 2026 daily surface record question.
- **AskNews La Razón (2026-02-18)**: AMOC-collapse risk framing; policy/security commentary; includes speculative model outcomes. *Quality:* mixed; *relevance:* not short-horizon SST daily record; mostly opinion/speculation.
- **AskNews Reuters/ThePrint/Investing.com (2026-02-16 to 02-18)**: Broad climate indicators (CO₂, warming, ocean heat). *Quality:* high for factual reporting; *relevance:* broad background only.
- **AskNews Meteo.it/MeteoWeb/Times of India (2026-02-17/18)**: ENSO transition / possible El Niño later in 2026 (50–60% late summer/fall). *Quality:* medium; *relevance:* indirect and mostly beyond the Feb–Apr record window.
- **AskNews AFP/France24/DH (2026-02-17)**: Attribution study for Valencia floods noting warm SSTs Mediterranean/N Atlantic contributed to moisture. *Quality:* medium-high; *relevance:* indirect (supports “warm waters exist”, but not “North Atlantic daily record will be set”).
- **AskNews Copernicus highlights / ocean heat content explainer articles (Jan 2026)**: General “oceans hot” context. *Quality:* varies; *relevance:* background.
- **AskNews RFI (2026-01-07)**: North Sea warmest year on record (regional). *Quality:* medium-high; *relevance:* some signal for NE Atlantic warmth, still not the specific daily-record criterion.

Key point: **none of the provided items give the decisive missing input** for this meta-question—i.e., whether *recent* North Atlantic daily SST is tracking close enough to all-time daily records to cause the Metaculus CP to rise above 20% by Feb 28.

### (b) Evidence analysis (weighted)
**Strong evidence (large shifts):**
- *None provided* that directly shows the target question’s likelihood changed materially in the past few days (e.g., Climate Reanalyzer series nearing/breaching daily records).

**Moderate evidence (moderate shifts):**
- **Copernicus-style claim in the outside-view bundle**: “parts of the subtropical & NE North Atlantic had warmest SSTs on record for time of year in Jan 2026.” If true and salient to forecasters, it supports **some upside** to record risk (but “parts” and “time of year” ≠ the exact “North Atlantic Daily SST index” record criterion). Net: modest upward pressure on the *underlying* probability, hence potentially on CP.
- **NOAA/CPC ENSO weakening toward neutral**: could reduce the “cooling brake” from La Niña, plausibly modestly increasing global/Atlantic warmth expectations into spring. Net: slight upward pressure.

**Weak evidence (small shifts):**
- General “2025 oceans were hot / OHC record / warming trends” articles: largely **already known** and likely priced into the 20% CP; limited short-horizon impact on CP movement.
- AMOC-collapse commentary: too long-term/speculative for Feb–Apr 2026 daily record; unlikely to move the Metaculus median in 10 days.
- Valencia attribution: supports warm regional SST context but doesn’t map cleanly to the specific North Atlantic basin index record.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- **Forecast horizon:** ~10 days (2026-02-18 → 2026-02-28 11:39 UTC).
- If **halved** (~5 days): less time for new SST data/bot updates/forecaster attention to shift the median → probability of crossing above 20% would fall.
- If **doubled** (~20 days): more daily SST points and more opportunity for a warm spike or forecaster updating → probability would rise.

### (d) Justification (inside view adjustment from outside view base rate)
Outside view base rate given: **33%**.

I adjust downward somewhat based on:
1. **Median “stickiness” at a focal value (20.00%)**: With a weighted-median aggregator, if many forecasts cluster at 20%, small new forecasts may not move the median at all. Crossing a strict “>20.00” threshold may require enough mass to shift the median, not just one or two updates.
2. **Lack of new, direct SST-near-record evidence in the provided info**: The types of updates that reliably move this CP in a 10-day window would be (i) observed SST approaching/breaking daily records, or (ii) widely-cited new forecast/model indicating imminent record risk. We don’t have that here.
3. **Status quo drift**: absent striking new data, many Metaculus questions don’t move much over ~10 days; and if anything, a “no record so far” narrative can nudge *slightly down* (though early-Feb is not necessarily the peak-risk part of the season).

Offsetting factors (upward):
- A non-trivial chance of **a genuine warm spike** or a bot/forecaster update reacting to fresh ClimateReanalyzer values, which could push CP to 21–25% quickly.
- ENSO-neutral transition could modestly increase perceived spring warmth risk.

Net: small downward adjustment from 33% to about **30%**.

Probability calibration:
- Baseline (outside view): 33%
- Adjustments:
  - Sticky median / focal-point threshold effect: −4%
  - No strong new direct SST evidence in provided set: −2%
  - ENSO-neutral / “oceans still hot” context: +3%
- **Inside view forecast:** **30%**

Checklist:
1. Criteria check: Yes if target CP **>20.00%** at **2026-02-28 11:39 UTC** (or follows target resolution if earlier).
2. Outside view base rate: 33%.
3. Consistency line: **30 out of 100 times, the target CP on Feb 28 is strictly above 20.00%.**
4. Key evidence (most significant):
   - CP currently exactly **20.00%** (threshold), and weighted-median CPs can be sticky.
   - No provided direct evidence that Feb 2026 North Atlantic SST is nearing/breaching daily records.
   - Some signals of broad ocean warmth and weakening La Niña (indirect, modestly supportive of upside).
5. Blind spot: If ClimateReanalyzer shows a near-record jump (or an actual record) in late Feb and bots/users react, CP could move above 20% rapidly.
6. Status quo outcome: CP stays at ~20% through Feb 28 is the single most likely point outcome.

Probability: 30%
