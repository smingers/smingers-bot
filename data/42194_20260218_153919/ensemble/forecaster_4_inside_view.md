Analysis:
1. Source analysis (quality / date / relevance to CP movement)

• Watchers (15 Feb 26, La Niña weakening): reputable secondary meteorology source; fresh; only tangentially relevant (Pacific ENSO, not North-Atlantic SST).  
• Rutgers & RTOFS interfaces (Feb 26): raw data portals, no narrative; quality neutral; relevance very weak.  
• TIME (9 Jan 26, record 2025 ocean heat); Copernicus, NOAA, RFI etc. (Jan 26 → Feb 18 26, record warm oceans/N-Sea): mainstream outlets relaying peer-reviewed work; good quality but cover 2025, not February 2026 SST observations.  
• La Razón (18 Feb 26, AMOC collapse risk) & ENSO pieces (Times of India, Meteo.it, 17 – 18 Feb 26): reputable news; topical but speculative, not about present-day North-Atlantic SST values.  
→ None of the articles report new February-2026 North-Atlantic SST spikes; they mostly recycle 2025 record-heat headlines. Hence little hard evidence for an imminent record before forecasts close.

2. Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong: none.  
Moderate: 2025 delivered record global/OHC warmth (TIME, Copernicus, NOAA) → supports a general prior that new records are easier than before, moderately increasing perceived chance.  
Weak: ENSO transition stories (Watchers, ToI) and AMOC-collapse discourse → weak, distant causal links to *late-winter* daily SSTs; little short-term predictive power.  
Weak: Interface pages merely show that real-time data are available (could trigger forecast tweaks in either direction).

Net evidence weight: modes of evidence are at best moderate and somewhat stale; bias for upward move is modest.

3. Timeframe analysis  
Window to resolution: 10.0 days (18 → 28 Feb 26).  
If the window were halved to 5 days, movement probability would fall roughly one-third; if doubled to 20 days, I would add ~5 pp to the chance of an uptick.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (CP crosses upward when sitting exactly on the threshold over 10 days for low-ish probability science/tech questions): 33 %.  
Inside-view factors:  
a) Early-2026 North-Atlantic SST has run *below* 2025’s curve so far (Metaculus background) – this slightly favours downward or flat moves (-4 pp).  
b) No fresh data in the last 48 h indicating a sudden warm surge – lowers likelihood of upward catalysts (-3 pp).  
c) Media cycle still full of “record ocean warmth” pieces, which may keep some forecasters mildly bullish (+2 pp).  
d) Ten-day window plus low traffic means ~40-60 % chance of *no* CP change; note that “exactly 20.00 %” still resolves No. (neutral to slight downward).  

Combining these, I trim the 33 % outside view to an inside view of 28 %.

Probability calibration
“About 28 times in 100, the community prediction will be > 20 % on 28 Feb 2026.”  
A ±10 pp shift would mean odds from 1.4:1 against (28 %) to near-even (38 %) or 2.3:1 against (18 %); given weak contemporary evidence, 28 % is a comfortable, moderately uncertain stance.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: Will Metaculus CP for “North Atlantic SST record before May 26” exceed 20 % at 11:39 UTC on 28 Feb 26?  
2. Base rate used: 33 % chance CP ticks upward within 10 days when now exactly at threshold.  
3. Consistency: “28 out of 100 times, CP ends > 20 %.” – yes.  
4. Key evidence (≤ 20 words each):  
   • 2026 SST to-date lower than 2025 curve.  
   • No February data bursts in news feeds.  
   • 10-day horizon, low-traffic question → high inertia.  
   • Ongoing 2025 record-warm headlines sustain mild upward sentiment.  
5. Blind-spot: A sudden mid-Feb SST spike reported by Climate Reanalyzer on 24-Feb causes CP to jump to 30 %. (+20 pp).  
6. Status-quo: Zero movement (20 %) resolves No; inertia slightly favours No outcome.

Probability: 28%
