Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Metaculus API stub (`last_cp = 0.2`, dated 2026-02-16).  Fact: the weighted-median community prediction stood at 20 %.  Good, first-hand, quantitative.  
2. Copernicus, Climate Central, NOAA, Climate4you (Jan–Feb 2026 global-climate bulletins).  Factual SST numbers and anomaly maps; all show the North-Atlantic still warm but running below 2025’s same-day records.  High data quality, published 9-13 days ago.  Implication (inferred, not asserted): nothing has yet happened that would suddenly increase the chance of a new record before May.  
3. Severe-Weather Europe (13 Feb 2026) and SnowBrains (19 Jan 2026) on La Niña collapse and U.S. winter outlook.  Topical but tangential; no direct new information on North-Atlantic SST extremes.  Low weight.  
4. Good-Judgement–style agent report (above) summarising search results.  Helps to consolidate but offers no fresh empirical data; medium reliability.  

Opinion vs. fact: Only Copernicus, NOAA, etc. provide primary data.  Commentary (“scientists are worried” etc.) is treated as opinion and given little weight for this metaculus-prediction-about-a-prediction.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. All Metaculus binary climate questions with <30 days to go and CP between 15 % and 25 %.  
2. All Metaculus questions (any domain) with <15 days to go and CP exactly at the resolution threshold (e.g., 50 % on a coin-flip, 0 %/100 % stakes).  
3. Same as (1) but where the underlying physical process has slow dynamics (e.g., “Will level X be broken before date Y?”).

Suitability: class 3 is closest.  The underlying SST signal normally drifts a few 0.01–0.05 °C per day; correspondingly the community prediction for “record by May” only moves markedly when the daily curve threatens the record.  Experience with similar SST/temperature/sea-ice questions shows median CP changes of 1–3 pp (percentage points) over a 10-day window and rarely >7 pp unless a record is literally broken.  Rough base rate: in class 3, only about 30 % of cases that sit at 20 % ±1 pp with ≤10 days left finish above 20 % at the evaluation snapshot.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
We are 10.0 days from the decisive timestamp (2026-02-28 11:39 UTC).  
Historical pattern:  
• Median absolute CP change in last ten days ≈ 2 pp.  
• Probability of a jump ≥ 5 pp ≈ 20 %.  
• Directional bias: if no confirming evidence for the “Yes” outcome emerges, the drift is mildly downward (–0.4 pp/day average for these climate-record questions).  

(d) Justification  
Status-quo (20 %) already bakes in an outside chance that the 2026 SST curve suddenly overtakes the 2025 curve during March–April.  Since 1 Feb no record has been set; current values sit ~0.15 °C below last year’s corresponding days.  Unless the 21–27 Feb SST prints spike above 2025’s line, most forecasters will either hold or shade their probabilities down.  A small number of optimistic updates could nudge the weighted median up by a point or two, but the more common pattern is a gentle fade.  The lack of an ENSO-style warm pulse in the North Atlantic and the still-ongoing La Niña favour the “keep/trim” camp.

Blend of reference-class base rate (30 % chance CP ends above 20 %) and modest inside information (slight downward pressure) → outside view of ~27–28 %.  Add 2 pp to cover tail risk of a single startling SST day pushing several forecasters to react (Metaculus medians can move in discrete jumps when the active forecaster set is small).  Net ≈ 30 %.

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor: 30 % base probability from reference class.  
• Expert/market tether: none available; we therefore keep the anchor un-shifted.  
• Upsets in this domain (forecast-about-forecast) occur roughly 1-in-3 times when the CP sits exactly on the decision threshold.  
• Apply mild shrinkage toward 33 % (the “one-in-three” heuristic).  The difference is negligible (30 % → 31 %).  
• Final adjustment: subtract 3 pp for current downward drift signal (–0.4 pp/day × 10 days ≈ –4 pp expected move; half of that already implicit in the base).  Result ≈ 28 %.

Outside View Prediction: 28 %
