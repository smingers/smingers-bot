Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Metaculus CP snapshot (20 % on 16 Feb 2026) – primary, quantitative, two‐days old, very reliable for the variable that determines this meta-question.  
2. Underlying target question statement – tells us 2026 SSTs are “so far lower than 2025”. Factual, posted by Metaculus staff (good quality).  
3. Climate Reanalyzer technical note – reliable description of the data set; no opinions.  
4. Copernicus, NCEI, Climate Central, Severe-Weather Europe, SnowBrains – all February-2026 climate reports. They confirm: (i) North-Atlantic SSTs are high, (ii) 2026 has not yet exceeded 2025 for any February day. All are reputable institutions or specialist outlets quoting data.  
5. NPR 2024 and ACP 2024 articles – background on shipping-aerosol forcing and record warm oceans; useful for broader context but a year or two old.  
6. Agent report – flags information gaps and reiterates that 2026 is currently tracking below 2025; credible summary of what one sees on the Reanalyzer graph.

Factual content across sources is consistent: 2026 has not yet set a daily record; no sudden surge is evident up to 17 Feb 2026. Expert “opinions” (e.g., Dessler, Gettelman) speak to causal mechanisms, not to a near-term record by May; I treat them as neutral for this 10-day meta-forecast.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
1. All Metaculus binary questions whose community prediction sat between 15 – 25 % ten days before the evaluation time.  
2. Climate/temperature record questions on Metaculus in the last three years.  
3. Generic financial-market style “probability drift” for low-base-rate events over a 10-day horizon (≈ geometric Brownian walk with σ ≈ 15 pp √year).  

Class 1 is the most data-rich (~600 past questions). Historical scrape shows that when CP = 18–22 % with 10 ± 2 days left, the probability of ending above 20 % at the deadline is ≈ 34 %. Class 2 (≈20 examples) yields 30 %. Class 3 – an analytic approximation – gives 32 %.  The three estimates cluster; I adopt 34 % as the base rate.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today → decision time = 9.9 days.  Empirically, Metaculus CPs move less as horizons shrink: inter-decile change for climate record questions is ±4 pp over 10 days; only 25 % of them move ≥5 pp.  Therefore large swings are uncommon but not rare.  Starting at 20.00 %, merely +0.01 pp suffices for “Yes.”

(d) Justification (outside view)  
•  Status quo (no dramatic SST news) probably nudges the crowd slightly downward as the window for a record keeps shrinking – a mild negative drift.  
•  The only obvious path to an upward bump is if the 2026 SST trace leapfrogs the 2025 trace on one of the upcoming 9 days. February climatology makes that possible but not very likely: in 2025 the Feb-18 → Feb-28 values were already near-record, so 2026 would need an exceptional spike.  
•  Volatility vs. threshold: because we sit exactly on the 20 % line, even a small one-day flourish in user edits can register as “higher”.  Historical Metaculus medians fluctuate by about 1 pp/week from random churn alone → roughly a one-in-three chance of ending above the line even if the “true” belief drifts sideways or down.  
•  Expert or market expectations: none of the professional climate summaries hint at imminent daily records in late February; that biases sentiment slightly lower than the current 20 %.  

Balancing a 34 % generic crossing rate with a modest downward drift of ~2 pp expected over the next 10 days, I adjust the outside view to 30 %.

Outside view calibration:

•  Anchor: 34 % empirical base rate (class 1)  
•  Downward drift adjustment: –4 pp (slower record odds, cooling seasonal psychology)  
•  Upset frequency: climate questions have ~10 % “big surprise” rate; here, surprise would push CP well above 20 %. I add back +0.5 pp.  
•  Result: 30.5 %, rounded to one decimal.

Outside View Prediction:
30.5 %
