    "description": "Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41595\n- Original question title: Will the North Atlantic sea surface temperature reach a daily record high before May 2026?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 20.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> This question resolves as **Yes** if, on any day after February 1, 2026 and before May 1, 2026, the [North Atlantic Daily Sea Surface Temperature](https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/sst_daily/?dm_id=natlan) is higher than the same day of the year during any other year.\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> The source for this question will be data from NOAA, if the relevant data is not available before May 6, 2026, this question will be **annulled**.\n> \n> This question will resolve based on the final values for all dates, except for those that are shown as preliminary when data for April 30, 2026 are first published.\n\nOriginal background: \n> In recent years, the daily mean sea surface temperature has dramatically increased far above the rate of climate change, part of this is [due to lower sulfur oxide emissions by sea traffic](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/24/13681/2024/), due to new regulations that took effect during 2020. In 2023 and 2024 the sea surface temperatures were well beyond what they had been even since 2020, in part due to lowered SO2 emissions, and [in part due to El Ni\u00f1o](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/14/nx-s1-5051849/hot-oceans-climate-science).\n> \n> North Atlantic Sea Surface Temperatures have started out high in 2026, but have so far been lower than during 2025.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41595,\"question_id\":41341,\"last_cp\":0.2}}`",

If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-28 11:39:00 is higher than 20.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 20.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled.
