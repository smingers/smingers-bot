Analysis:
The market’s belief about whether the North Atlantic will break its daily SST record before May 2026 should react to any fresh evidence that (a) temperatures are already close to last year’s record‐setting curve, (b) short-term climate drivers (e.g., lingering El Niño warmth, reduced Saharan dust, altered aerosol levels, upcoming Atlantic hurricane season) are likely to keep the basin abnormally warm through April, or (c) the opposite—recent cooling, strong trade-wind forecasts, or increased volcanic/aerosol forcing—makes another record less likely. Therefore, the most decision-relevant news right now includes:

• NOAA and University of Maine’s Climate Reanalyzer daily plots or summaries for February 2026.  
• Scientific or media commentary noting whether the 2026 curve is converging toward or diverging from 2025’s record trajectory.  
• Any discussion on X/Twitter or blogs highlighting “record warm for the date” headlines.  
• Coverage of model outlooks through March–April 2026 (sub-seasonal SST forecasts, ENSO transition updates).  
• Mentions of the Metaculus question itself, since spikes in attention can drive a wave of new forecasts and move the community prediction.

Thus the search should target very recent ocean-temperature datasets and expert commentary dated February 2026.
