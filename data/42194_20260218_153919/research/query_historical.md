Analysis:
To judge whether the Metaculus community prediction will tick above 20 % in the next ten days, we need (a) a sense of how the community’s probability has been moving and (b) any new scientific information that might plausibly shift sentiment.  Historical context therefore includes: daily or weekly snapshots of the community forecast for the target question; recent observations of North Atlantic SST anomalies and whether 2026 temperatures are approaching record‐setting territory; and fresh commentary from climate scientists or the media that could influence forecasters.  Searches should thus target (1) the latest NOAA/Climate Reanalyzer SST numbers and analysis pieces, (2) February-2026 news about unusual Atlantic warmth, and (3) any publicly visible plot or discussion of the Metaculus question’s prediction history.
