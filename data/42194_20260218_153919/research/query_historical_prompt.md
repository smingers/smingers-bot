You are currently doing research for historical information on the below forecasting question.

The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 20.00% on 2026-02-28 for the Metaculus question "Will the North Atlantic sea surface temperature reach a daily record high before May 2026?"?

Question background:
Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency.

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41595
- Original question title: Will the North Atlantic sea surface temperature reach a daily record high before May 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 20.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question resolves as **Yes** if, on any day after February 1, 2026 and before May 1, 2026, the [North Atlantic Daily Sea Surface Temperature](https://climatereanalyzer.org/clim/sst_daily/?dm_id=natlan) is higher than the same day of the year during any other year.

Original fine print: 
> The source for this question will be data from NOAA, if the relevant data is not available before May 6, 2026, this question will be **annulled**.
> 
> This question will resolve based on the final values for all dates, except for those that are shown as preliminary when data for April 30, 2026 are first published.

Original background: 
> In recent years, the daily mean sea surface temperature has dramatically increased far above the rate of climate change, part of this is [due to lower sulfur oxide emissions by sea traffic](https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/24/13681/2024/), due to new regulations that took effect during 2020. In 2023 and 2024 the sea surface temperatures were well beyond what they had been even since 2020, in part due to lowered SO2 emissions, and [in part due to El Niño](https://www.npr.org/2024/08/14/nx-s1-5051849/hot-oceans-climate-science).
> 
> North Atlantic Sea Surface Temperatures have started out high in 2026, but have so far been lower than during 2025.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41595) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-28 11:39:00 is higher than 20.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 20.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-28 11:39:00, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-18. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-18 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic or financial data, add a FRED query. Use a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate") or a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE"). Returns historical data with computed statistics.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one Agent query.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant historical context needed to generate an outside view.}

Search queries:
1. your query here (Google)
2. your query here (Google News)
3. your query here (Agent)
4. economic indicator query (FRED) -- only if question involves economic/financial data
