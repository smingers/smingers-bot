This paradox is explained by concerns over the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), a critical ocean current system that transports warm water northward and cold water southward, moderating northern Europe\u2019s climate. Accelerated Arctic ice melt and massive freshwater influx from Greenland could disrupt AMOC\u2019s density-driven flow, potentially weakening or collapsing it\u2014a phenomenon previously linked to the last glacial period, which ended about 12,000 years ago. In September 2025, Iceland\u2019s National Security Council officially recognized AMOC collapse as a national security risk. Climate models project winter temperatures in Iceland potentially dropping to -45\u00b0C, with sea ice potentially returning around the island for the first time since the Viking era. Hildigunnur Thorsteinsson, Director General of Iceland\u2019s Meteorological Office, stated the country could become 'a giant glacier' under such conditions. The collapse would not be limited to the North Atlantic; it could shift tropical rainfall belts, disrupt agriculture, accelerate sea-level rise along North America\u2019s eastern coast, reduce Amazon rainfall, and intensify European heatwaves. The report urges decisive decarbonization, net-negative emissions, increased scientific funding, and the creation of an early-warning system integrating real-time observations with advanced climate models.

According to NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies, global surface temperatures in 2025 were 1.19\u00b0C above the 1951\u20131980 average, while the World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reported a 1.44\u00b0C rise above pre-industrial levels, placing 2025 among the top three warmest years in 176 years of recorded data. Atmospheric concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and nitrous oxide reached record highs, driven by fossil fuel emissions projected at 38.1 billion tonnes in 2025\u2014an increase of 1.1% from 2024\u2014despite rapid growth in renewable energy. The Global Carbon Budget report, compiled by over 130 scientists, warns that only about 170 billion tonnes of CO\u2082 (roughly four years of current emissions) remain before the 1.5\u00b0C warming threshold is exceeded. Emissions are projected to rise in China, India, the United States, and the European Union, while Japan sees a decline. In the Arctic, October 2024\u2013September 2025 was the warmest period since 1900, with sea-ice extent reaching a record low of 14.47 million square kilometers in March 2025.

According to projections from major global meteorological centers, if this trend confirms, El Ni\u00f1o could significantly raise global temperatures, making the 2026\u20132027 period one of the hottest in modern history. The NOAA\u2019s Climate Prediction Service estimates a 50\u201360% chance of El Ni\u00f1o developing between late summer and early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology also suggests a possible onset as early as June, though seasonal forecasts remain uncertain due to the sensitivity of atmospheric and oceanic systems. El Ni\u00f1o would alter regional weather patterns: southern U.S. and Mediterranean Europe may experience above-average precipitation, increasing flood and landslide risks, while northern U.S. and Canada could face warmer, drier conditions, affecting agriculture, water resources, and ecosystems. Oceanically, El Ni\u00f1o weakens the Atlantic hurricane season but increases cyclonic activity in the central and eastern Pacific, shifting risks to coastal communities and economic sectors. As a phase of the ENSO (El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation), El Ni\u00f1o involves warmer-than-average sea surface temperatures in the tropical eastern Pacific, weakening trade winds and altering atmospheric pressure. These changes propagate globally, affecting precipitation, temperature, and extreme weather frequency. El Ni\u00f1o can raise global average temperatures by approximately 0.2\u00b0C\u2014modest in isolation but significant at planetary scale. The 2025 year, despite the cooling influence of La Ni\u00f1a, was among the hottest ever recorded; without that natural brake, El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s arrival in 2026\u20132027 could trigger new global heat records, potentially making these years historically significant for planetary temperatures.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 09:09 AM\nSource:[Meteo.it](https://www.meteo.it/notizie/el-nino-verso-il-ritorno-cambiamenti-nel-pacifico-e-possibili-effetti-su-europa-e-usa-990ccf0a)\n\n**Human-Caused Climate Change Intensified 2024 Valencia Floods, Study Confirms**\nHuman-caused climate change significantly intensified the deadly floods near Valencia, Spain, in late 2024, according to a study published in Nature Communications on February 17, 2026.

Both agencies forecast a transition to neutral ENSO conditions between February and April 2026, with neutral conditions expected to persist through the Northern Hemisphere summer. Beyond mid-2026, model projections diverge, but the majority suggest a 50% to 60% chance of an El Ni\u00f1o outbreak during late summer or autumn 2026. Forecasters caution that long-range ENSO predictions are inherently uncertain due to the seasonal predictability barrier, especially at this time of year. However, the shift from La Ni\u00f1a to El Ni\u00f1o would mark a significant change in Pacific climate patterns. El Ni\u00f1o typically raises global average temperatures by 0.1 to 0.2\u00b0C, which, in the context of ongoing global warming, could push annual temperature records in 2026 or 2027. Regional impacts include wetter conditions in the southern U.S. and southern Europe, warmer and drier weather in northern North America, reduced Atlantic hurricane activity, and increased storm activity in the central and eastern Pacific. The Pacific is currently in transition, with neutral conditions expected first, followed by uncertain but closely monitored developments.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 03:04 PM\nSource:[The Times of India](https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/world/rest-of-world/el-nio-warning-signs-grow-as-la-nia-weakens-in-the-pacific-raising-2026-heat-risks-worldwide/articleshow/128470029.cms)\n\n**El Ni\u00f1o on the Horizon: What\u2019s Happening in the Pacific and What It Means for Europe and the USA**\nInternational climate agencies are monitoring a potential transition to El Ni\u00f1o by 2026, with significant global implications for temperature, precipitation, and extreme weather events. Recent observations in the tropical eastern Pacific\u2014a key region of Earth's climate system\u2014show signs suggesting the development of a new El Ni\u00f1o event in the coming months. According to projections from major global meteorological centers, if confirmed, this event could trigger a chain of planetary-scale climate impacts, making 2026\u20132027 a strong candidate for being among the hottest periods ever recorded. El Ni\u00f1o, a phase of the El Ni\u00f1o-Southern Oscillation (ENSO), involves anomalous warming of surface ocean waters, weakening of trade winds, and shifts in atmospheric pressure. This disrupts global weather patterns through atmospheric teleconnections. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) estimates a 50\u201360% probability of El Ni\u00f1o developing between late summer and early autumn in the Northern Hemisphere. The Australian Bureau of Meteorology also suggests a possible onset as early as June 2026. However, experts caution that seasonal forecasts carry high uncertainty due to the complexity of ocean-atmosphere interactions. Currently, the planet is in a weakening La Ni\u00f1a phase, with a 60% chance of transitioning to neutral conditions between February and April 2026. Historically, many neutral phases are followed by El Ni\u00f1o, though not guaranteed. El Ni\u00f1o can raise global average temperatures by up to 0.2\u00b0C\u2014significant in the context of ongoing global warming. The year 2025, despite a cooling La Ni\u00f1a, was already among the warmest on record. Without La Ni\u00f1a\u2019s cooling effect and with El Ni\u00f1o\u2019s warming influence, 2026 and 2027 could set new temperature records. Regionally, El Ni\u00f1o is expected to increase precipitation in the southern United States and southern Europe (including the Mediterranean), raising flood and landslide risks, while northern U.S. and Canadian regions may face hotter, drier conditions, impacting water resources, agriculture, and ecosystems. In the tropics, El Ni\u00f1o tends to suppress Atlantic hurricane activity while increasing cyclone frequency in the central and eastern Pacific, shifting regional risks. The Pacific\u2019s changes are not isolated; El Ni\u00f1o may amplify existing climate trends, accelerating extreme weather. Scientists continue to closely monitor ocean temperatures and atmospheric patterns, warning that policy, economic, and environmental decisions in the coming years must prepare for increasingly unstable and extreme climate conditions.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 06:04 AM\nSource:[MeteoWeb](https://www.meteoweb.eu/2026/02/el-nino-sta-per-tornare-cosa-sta-succedendo-nel-pacifico-e-cosa-significa-per-europa-e-usa/1001898434/)\n\n**Climate Challenge: A Decade After Paris Agreement By Reuters**\nTen years after the Paris Agreement took effect, newly released climate data reveals accelerating global warming, with 2025 ranking among the three hottest years on record.

Global fossil fuel CO\u2082 emissions are projected to reach a record 38.1 billion tonnes in 2025, rising 1.1% from the previous year, driven by increased coal, oil, and gas use despite renewable energy growth. Atmospheric CO\u2082 concentrations are now roughly 52% above pre-industrial levels, and scientists warn that only about 170 billion tonnes of CO\u2082\u2014equivalent to roughly four years of current emissions\u2014remain before the 1.5\u00b0C warming threshold is exceeded. Emissions are expected to rise in China, India, the U.S., and the EU, while declining slightly in Japan. The Arctic experienced its warmest period since 1900 (October 2024\u2013September 2025), with sea-ice extent reaching a record low of 14.47 million square kilometers in March 2025. Oceans absorbed record heat in 2025, setting new highs for upper-ocean heat content, and sea levels are projected to rise 0.20\u20130.29 meters by 2050 relative to 1995\u20132014. Despite a pledge at the UN meeting in Brazil to increase funding for climate adaptation in poorer nations, countries failed to agree on explicit plans to phase out fossil fuels or strengthen emissions reductions. U.S. President Donald Trump, a climate change skeptic, has rolled back environmental policies and described climate change as a hoax, contributing to global challenges in advancing climate action.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 06:12 PM\nSource:[Investing.com](https://www.investing.com/news/commodities-news/climate-challenge-a-decade-after-paris-agreement-4507755)\n\n**Global Climate Highlights 2025: Record Heat, Ocean Warming, and Ice Extremes Signal Accelerating Climate Crisis**\nThe Copernicus Climate Change Service's Global Climate Highlights 2025 report confirms that global temperatures have stabilized at approximately +1.47\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels, with the 2023\u20132025 triennial average exceeding the symbolic 1.5\u00b0C threshold set by the Paris Agreement for the first time. The 2025 annual global mean temperature reached 14.97\u00b0C, +0.59\u00b0C above the 1991\u20132020 baseline and +1.47\u00b0C above pre-industrial levels\u2014making it the third warmest year on record, behind 2023 and 2024. All years from 2015 to 2025 rank among the hottest ever recorded. Ocean surface temperatures remained exceptionally high in 2025, even without El Ni\u00f1o, making it the third hottest year for oceans with a mean of 20.73\u00b0C\u2014the highest recorded during a La Ni\u00f1a year; 42% of non-polar oceans showed 'well above average' anomalies, particularly in the northwestern Pacific, North Atlantic, and Mediterranean. Arctic sea ice reached its lowest maximum extent in 47 years of satellite observation in March 2025, while Antarctic sea ice hit its fourth lowest annual minimum. Combined, the Arctic and Antarctic ice coverage reached the lowest global extent ever observed in February. The year was marked by extreme weather events, including record floods, heatwaves, and wildfires across Europe, the Iberian Peninsula, the Balkans, California, and tropical regions in Asia and Latin America. Half the planet experienced more days than normal with perceived temperatures above 32\u00b0C, and parts of Central Africa recorded over 100 days of intense heat. With current warming at ~+1.4\u00b0C, the 1.5\u00b0C threshold is projected to be breached by 2029 if current trends continue\u2014earlier than IPCC predictions. The Copernicus Climate Change Service estimates an 80% probability that at least one of the next five years (2025\u20132029) will surpass 2024 as the hottest year on record.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: January 26, 2026 12:55 PM\nSource:[Info Data](https://www.infodata.ilsole24ore.com/2026/01/26/in-cinque-punti-due-grafici-e-tre-video-cosa-dice-il-global-climate-highlights-2025/)\n\n**Scientists Warn of Unprecedented Global Ocean Warming in 2025**\nA global team of scientists has warned of unprecedented ocean warming in 2025, with 16% of the ocean surface recording record-high temperatures, particularly in tropical regions, the South Atlantic, and the North Pacific. The study, conducted by the Chinese Institute of Atmospheric Physics, the European Copernicus Marine Service, and the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), relied on data from the global Argo network of autonomous floats measuring ocean temperatures at depth. Surface water temperatures rose by approximately 0.5\u00b0C compared to previous decades. Scientists confirmed this warming contributes to sea level rise, extreme weather patterns, and intensified storms and hurricanes. In 2025, Southeast Asia experienced widespread flooding, the Middle East faced severe droughts, and storm intensity increased. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) reported 2025 as one of the three hottest years on record, with the past 11 years being the warmest ever recorded. Global average surface temperature reached 1.44\u00b0C above the 1850\u20131900 baseline. Despite the year beginning and ending with a La Ni\u00f1a cooling phase, the WMO's executive secretary, Celeste Saulo, emphasized that greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere made 2025 among the hottest years globally. Scientists stressed that rising land and ocean temperatures are fueling extreme weather events such as heatwaves, heavy rainfall, and intense tropical cyclones, underscoring the urgent need for early warning systems. The Copernicus Observatory projected 2025 as likely the second or third hottest year in history, potentially matching the heat levels of 2023. Experts affirmed that human-driven climate change is increasing both the frequency and intensity of extreme weather, exemplified by powerful tropical cyclones that recently caused extensive flooding, property damage, and loss of life in Southeast Asia.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 04:18 PM\nSource:[\u0645\u062c\u0644\u0629 \u0633\u064a\u062f\u062a\u064a](https://www.sayidaty.net/%D8%A8%D9%84%D8%B3/%D8%A3%D8%AE%D8%A8%D8%A7%D8%B1/1828340-%D8%AD%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%A9-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AD%D9%8A%D8%B7%D8%A7%D8%AA)\n\n**Ocean Temperatures Hit Historic Highs in 2025: Why It's a Cause for Concern**\nIn 2025, Earth's oceans reached record-high heat levels for the ninth consecutive year, setting a new historical maximum in ocean heat content (OHC), according to a study published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences. The research, conducted by an international team of over 50 scientists from 31 institutions across Asia, Europe, and the Americas, confirms the ongoing accumulation of heat in the oceans, which absorb more than 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases. The study combines data from major global sources, including the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Copernicus Marine, and NOAA/NCEI, using a transcontinental meta-analysis (CIGAR-RT). In 2025, ocean heat content increased by 23 zettajoules\u2014equivalent to 37 years of global primary energy consumption. The warming is not uniform: the Southern Ocean, North Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, and Indo-Pacific Warm Pool experienced strong heating, while the equatorial Pacific, western Indian Ocean, and tropical Atlantic saw cooling, partly due to a shift toward La Ni\u00f1a conditions. Since the 1990s, ocean warming has intensified, culminating in the 2025 record. The global annual average sea surface temperature in 2025 was the third warmest on record, about 0.5 \u00b0C above the 1981\u20132010 baseline, slightly lower than 2023 and 2024 due to the transition from El Ni\u00f1o to La Ni\u00f1a. Rising ocean temperatures contribute to sea-level rise, prolonged heatwaves, and intensified extreme weather, including stronger cyclones, extreme rainfall, flooding in Southeast Asia, droughts in the Middle East, and floods in Mexico and the northwestern Pacific. The study\u2019s authors emphasize that while scientific understanding evolves, the key uncertainty lies in human action: 'Together, we can reduce emissions, better prepare for upcoming changes, and help safeguard a future climate in which humans can thrive.' The findings will be featured in a special collection on ocean heat content in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 11, 2026 04:08 PM\nSource:[BioBioChile](https://www.biobiochile.cl/noticias/ciencia-y-tecnologia/ciencia/2026/01/11/temperatura-de-los-oceanos-alcanzo-maximos-historicos-en-2025-por-que-es-preocupante.shtml)\n\n**Ocean Temperatures Hit New Record in 2025, Study Confirms**\nThe ocean reached a new record high in heat content in 2025, according to a study published in Advances in Atmospheric Sciences by an international team of over 50 scientists from 31 institutions worldwide.

Approximately 16% of the global ocean surface recorded a new OHC record, and about 33% were among the three warmest on record. The study notes uneven warming: the Southern Ocean, North Atlantic, Mediterranean Sea, and the Indo-Pacific warm pool experienced strong heating, while the equatorial Pacific, western Indian Ocean, and tropical Atlantic cooled\u2014partly due to a transition to La Ni\u00f1a conditions. Since the 1990s, ocean warming has intensified, culminating in the 2025 peak.

Rising ocean temperatures drive sea-level rise, intensify heatwaves and extreme weather, increase evaporation and rainfall, and contribute to stronger tropical cyclones, floods in Southeast Asia, droughts in the Middle East, and flooding in Mexico and the northwestern Pacific. The researchers emphasize that while science evolves, the greatest climate uncertainty lies in human decisions.

The research, conducted by an international team of over 50 scientists from 31 institutions across Asia, Europe, and the Americas, combined data from major global sources including the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Copernicus Marine, and NOAA/NCEI, using a cross-continental meta-analysis (CIGAR-RT). The study confirms that OHC reached an all-time high in 2025, with the oceans absorbing over 90% of the excess heat trapped by greenhouse gases. The heat increase amounted to 23 zettajoules\u2014equivalent to 37 years of global primary energy consumption. The warming is not uniform: approximately 16% of the ocean surface experienced record OHC levels, and about 33% reached one of the three warmest values in their historical records. The most affected regions were the tropical and South Atlantic, North Pacific, and Southern Ocean. Since the 1990s, ocean warming has intensified, culminating in 2025. The global mean sea surface temperature in 2025 was the third highest on record, about 0.5\u00b0C above the 1981\u20132010 reference average, slightly lower than 2023 and 2024 due to the transition from El Ni\u00f1o to La Ni\u00f1a in the tropical Pacific. The study highlights that ocean warming drives sea-level rise, intensifies heatwaves, and exacerbates extreme weather events, including stronger cyclones, heavy rainfall, floods in Southeast Asia, droughts in the Middle East, and flooding in Mexico and the northwestern Pacific.

The study, conducted by over 50 scientists from 30 research institutions including the Chinese Academy of Sciences' Institute of Atmospheric Physics, Copernicus Marine, and NOAA/NCEI, found that oceans absorbed 23 zettajoules of additional energy compared to 2024\u2014equivalent to the global human energy consumption over 37 years. This marks the highest recorded ocean heat content (COH) in history. The warming continued due to rising greenhouse gas concentrations, with conditions shifting toward La Ni\u00f1a during the year. Approximately 16% of the global ocean surface experienced record-high COH, while 33% were in the top three highest values in historical records. Affected regions included the South and tropical Atlantic, North Pacific, Southern Ocean, Mediterranean Sea, and northern Indian Ocean. The annual mean sea surface temperature (TSM) in 2025 was the third highest on record, 0.5\u202f\u00b0C above the 1981\u20132010 average, slightly lower than 2023 and 2024 due to the transition from El Ni\u00f1o to La Ni\u00f1a. The increased ocean heat fueled stronger evaporation, intense rainfall, cyclones, and extreme weather events, contributing to floods in Southeast Asia and Mexico, droughts in the Middle East, and extraordinary rains in the northwestern Pacific. Ocean warming drives sea-level rise through thermal expansion, prolongs marine heatwaves, and intensifies atmospheric conditions. These changes severely impact marine ecosystems and coastal communities, exemplified by coral bleaching illustrated on the cover of the journal\u2019s special edition, where mythical crab and shrimp figures are depicted with weakened shells due to warming and ocean acidification. Lead researcher Lijing Cheng explained the imagery symbolizes ecological vulnerability. While scientific understanding has advanced, the greatest uncertainty lies in human decisions on emissions and mitigation policies. Experts from Agencia SINC emphasize that future climate outcomes depend on global efforts to reduce emissions and strengthen adaptation strategies, underscoring the urgent need to protect a livable climate for future generations.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 09, 2026 12:53 PM\nSource:[El Arague\u00f1o](https://elaragueno.com.ve/los-oceanos-alcanzaron-un-nuevo-record-de-calor-en-2025/)\n\n**2025 warmest year on record in North Sea according to German maritime agency**\nGermany's Federal Maritime and Hydrographic Agency (BSH) reported that the North Sea recorded its warmest year on record in 2025, with an average surface temperature of 11.6\u00b0C\u2014the highest since records began in 1969. The Baltic Sea followed closely, averaging 9.7\u00b0C, 1.1\u00b0C above its 1997\u20132021 mean and the second-highest since 1990. Seasonally, spring averaged 8.7\u00b0C (0.9\u00b0C above normal), the hottest since 1997, while summer reached 15.7\u00b0C\u2014surpassing 2003 and 2014 to become the warmest on record since 1969, with regional anomalies exceeding 2\u00b0C. A 55-day marine heatwave at Kiel Lighthouse (late March to May) was the longest on record since 1989, driven by reduced cloud cover, increased solar heating, and inflows of warm Atlantic water. These trends align with the UN\u2019s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), which notes oceans have absorbed over 90% of excess atmospheric heat since 1970, with warming rates more than doubling since 1993\u2014from 3\u20134 Zetajoules (ZJ) per year pre-1993 to over 6 ZJ annually thereafter. One ZJ equals the energy from 239 million Hiroshima bombs or global power consumption for a year. Marine heatwaves have doubled in frequency since 1982 and intensified globally. UNESCO\u2019s 2024 State of the Ocean report confirms ocean warming has doubled over two decades, contributing to a 2% deoxygenation since the 1960s, 30% acidification since pre-industrial times, and 40% of recent sea-level rise from thermal expansion. Warming threatens North Sea biodiversity, disrupting plankton, fish migration, and oxygen levels, creating 'dead zones' and stressing cold-adapted species; zooplankton collapses from 2018\u20132022 indicate future risks. Species shifts may benefit some sharks or oysters but risk invasive species and ecosystem imbalance. The Baltic Sea, warming nearly 2\u00b0C since 1990, faces heightened risks of seabed hypoxia. Coastal communities anticipate stronger storms and erosion due to sea-level rise and intensified weather patterns.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 07, 2026 01:21 PM\nSource:[RFI](https://www.rfi.fr/en/environment/20260107-2025-warmest-year-on-record-in-north-sea-according-to-german-maritime-agency)\n\n**Oceans Continue to Heat Up, Setting New Records in 2024**\nGlobal sea surface temperatures reached a record high of 21\u00b0C in spring 2024, according to data from 1982 onward. The Copernicus Marine Service reported that marine heatwaves in 2023 and 2024 were particularly intense and prolonged, affecting large portions of the oceans\u2014over 300 days in parts of the Atlantic in 2023 alone. Since the 1960s, ocean warming has accelerated, indicating a dangerous imbalance in Earth\u2019s systems due to climate change. The Baltic Sea is warming more than three times faster than the global average over a 30-year period, while the North Sea is warming at twice the global rate. In summer 2025, sea temperatures in the southwestern Baltic Sea, including German waters, were up to 1.5\u00b0C above the 1997\u20132021 average. Stefan Rahmstorf of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research emphasized that ocean warming drives increased evaporation, leading to more extreme rainfall and flooding on land, and contributes to rising sea levels, exacerbating coastal flooding. The Copernicus Marine Service, part of the EU\u2019s Copernicus Earth observation program and funded by the European Commission, conducts ocean analyses and forecasts.\nOriginal language: de\nPublish date: October 01, 2025 03:40 AM\nSource:[Proplanta](https://www.proplanta.de/agrar-nachrichten/umwelt/ozeane-heizen-sich-weiter-auf_article1759290046.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
