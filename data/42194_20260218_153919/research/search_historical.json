Scientists are trying to figure out why\"\n\n**Date:** August 14, 2024  \n**Author:** Rebecca Hersher\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- Worldwide average ocean temperatures were in record-breaking territory for 15 months straight starting from April 2023\n- Abnormally hot ocean water fuels dangerous hurricanes (examples cited: Hurricane Ernesto expected to rapidly strengthen in August 2024, Hurricane Debby dumped massive rain on East Coast)\n- Ocean water near Florida is so warm it's threatening coral reefs\n- In 2020, new international shipping regulations required ships to use cleaner fuel with less sulfur pollution\n- The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption occurred in 2022 off the coast of Tonga\n- The sun's energy output changes by about 0.1% over its 11-year solar cycle, causing Earth's global temperatures to change by a little less than 0.1 degree Celsius\n\n## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):\n\n**Andrew Dessler (climate scientist, Texas A&M):**\n- \"The two primary things are obviously global warming and El Ni\u00f1o\"\n- Oceans are even warmer than expected from these two trends alone\n- Was \"very skeptical\" of the volcanic warming effect\n- Notes the Hunga-Tonga eruption changed total atmospheric water vapor very little\n- Predicts: \"My guess is, in the end, it's just going to be internal variability. Like, something weird happened! Because the climate's always doing something weird.\"\n- \"The next few months will tell us if we've really broken the climate\"\n\n**Stephen Smith (air pollution and climate change expert, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory):**\n- On cleaner shipping fuel: \"This saves lives\"\n- Acknowledges sulfur pollution was reflecting some of the sun's heat\n\n**Andrew Gettelman (climate scientist, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory):**\n- Co-author of forthcoming study on ship pollution effects\n- \"This could be contributing to the warm temperatures we've seen in the last couple years\" (referring to reduced ship pollution)\n- \"We're going to see the planet warm in fits and starts\"\n- Notes there was a period in the 2010s when Earth didn't warm much, but it was temporary\n- \"I think people are starting to get a little worried that we are warming at the high end of what [climate models predicted]\"\n\n**Gregory Kopp (solar physicist, University of Colorado, Boulder):**\n- \"The sun isn't causing the recent record-breaking sea-surface temperatures\"\n- \"The sea contains so much heat energy that it doesn't respond on the relatively short solar-cycle timescales\"\n\n## Main Theories Explored:\n\n1. **Climate change and El Ni\u00f1o** (confirmed contributors): Fossil fuel burning releases heat-trapping gases absorbed by oceans; El Ni\u00f1o was active in 2023 and early 2024\n\n2. **Cleaner shipping fuel** (likely contributor): Reduced sulfur pollution means fewer reflective clouds, allowing more solar heat to reach ocean surface. Research suggests this is contributing to warming.\n\n3. **Hunga-Tonga volcanic eruption** (ruled out): Despite initial speculation about water vapor acting as greenhouse gas, recent research suggests this is NOT a significant factor\n\n4. **Solar activity** (ruled out): Changes in sun's output don't account for abnormal ocean temperatures\n\n5. **Natural variability/\"weirdness\"** (possible contributor): Normal year-to-year climate variability could account for extra warming when layered on top of other factors\n\n## Key Uncertainty:\n\nScientists don't know for sure what's driving ocean temperatures into record-breaking territory beyond climate change and El Ni\u00f1o. The real concern is whether the overall warming trend is accelerating, which will become clearer in the coming months.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.climate4you.com/SeaTemperatures.htm\">\n## Summary of Climate4you Ocean Temperatures Article\n\n### Key Facts and Data:\n\n**Recent Sea Surface Temperature Status (as of early February 2026):**\n- Arctic and North Atlantic sea surface temperature data shown for February 13, 2026, according to the Danish Meteorological Institute (DMI)\n- Maps display current SST and anomalies (deviation from 1961-1990 reference period)\n\n**Temperature Data Series:**\n- Global monthly average lower troposphere temperature above oceans tracked since 1979 (University of Alabama at Huntsville), with last month shown as January 2026\n- Global monthly average sea surface temperature (SST) since 1979 from multiple sources:\n  - CRU (UK): Last month shown December 2025 (updated January 16, 2026)\n  - NCDC (USA): Last month shown January 2026 (updated February 12, 2026)\n\n**Regional SST Data (all updated for January 2026):**\n- Tropics (10\u00b0N-10\u00b0S): Last month shown January 2026 (updated February 7, 2026)\n- North Atlantic (5\u00b0-20\u00b0N, 30-60\u00b0W): Last month shown January 2026 (updated February 7, 2026)\n- South Atlantic (0-20\u00b0S, 30\u00b0W-10\u00b0E): Last month shown January 2026 (updated February 7, 2026)\n- Ni\u00f1o 3.4 region: Last month shown January 2026 (updated February 7, 2026)\n\n### Notable Context:\n- The article notes a June 18, 2015 administrative change by NCDC to their sea surface temperature record, which the author suggests \"produced a record giving the impression of a continuous temperature increase\"\n- Comparison with Argo float measurements is provided throughout for validation\n\n### Limitations:\nThe article primarily presents graphical data and technical descriptions without providing specific numerical values for current temperatures or anomalies.

February 2026 Outlook Article\n\n**Source:** SnowBrains, January 19, 2026\n\n### Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**ENSO Conditions:**\n- La Ni\u00f1a conditions remain in place with the Ni\u00f1o 3.4 index at \u20130.8\u00b0C\n- 75% chance of transition to ENSO-neutral phase during January-February-March 2026 season\n- Subsurface ocean data shows warm water pushing eastward from the western Pacific\n\n**Current Snowpack Deficits (as of mid-January):**\n- Sierra Nevada and Cascade basins: 50-70% of normal snowpack\n- Colorado's southern mountains and Utah's Wasatch Range: trailing averages by similar margins (50-70%)\n\n**February 2026 Temperature Forecast:**\n- Below-normal temperatures favored across northern and central U.S.\n- Highest confidence (40-50% chance) for below-normal temperatures over Northern High Plains\n- Above-normal temperatures (>50% probability) favored for Florida Peninsula\n- Above-normal temperatures also expected in Southwest and Southern California (weaker signal)\n\n**February 2026 Precipitation Forecast:**\n- Pacific Northwest and Northern Rockies have strongest odds (>50% in some areas) for above-normal precipitation\n- Western Montana, Idaho, and northern Wyoming could see more active storm pattern\n- Southwest and southern two-thirds of California projected to stay relatively warm and dry\n- Southern tier of country, particularly Southern California and Southeast, expected to be drier than normal\n\n### Atmospheric Patterns:\n\n**Madden-Julian Oscillation (MJO):**\n- Strengthening MJO signal moving into Western Hemisphere\n- Could help energize Pacific storm track, especially across Northern Rockies and adjacent High Plains\n- Most ECMWF ensemble members predict MJO event to propagate to Western Hemisphere/Africa or Indian Ocean by start of February\n\n**Other Indices:**\n- Arctic Oscillation (AO) and North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO): mostly negative in early January\n- Pacific North America (PNA) index: transitioned from negative to positive phase during first half of January\n\n### Model Uncertainty:\n\nThe article notes significant disagreement between statistical and dynamical models:\n- Statistical forecasts (based on past atmospheric analogs) lean toward colder outcomes\n- Dynamical models (simulating future atmospheric physics) tend to be warmer\n- This dichotomy creates increased uncertainty in the February temperature outlook\n\n### Expert Opinion:\n\nNOAA climate scientists (quoted): \"The setup favors a more active northern tier and cooler temperatures, which could finally flip parts of the West into a more winter-like pattern.\"\n\n---\n\n**Note:** This article focuses on U.S. weather patterns and does not contain information directly relevant to North

shows weaker cold La Ni\u00f1a anomalies in the central tropical Pacific being \"dissolved from both sides to the east and west\"\n- A warmer anomaly is establishing in the eastern parts, forecast to spread westward\n- Video analysis shows \"a healthy La Ni\u00f1a event at the start\" that has been \"rapidly dissolving in recent weeks\"\n\n**Long-Range ENSO Forecasts:**\n- The C3S multi-model ENSO outlook shows \"the end of the cold La Ni\u00f1a anomaly, with a rapid transition into a new El Ni\u00f1o (above +0.5) by summer\"\n- This is described as a \"combined forecast from multiple long-range models, increasing the forecast confidence\"\n- Most forecasts agree on \"the rapid emergence of a 2026/2027 El Ni\u00f1o event\"\n\n**European Weather Implications:**\n- The article focuses primarily on European spring weather patterns and their connection to the La Ni\u00f1a collapse\n- Historical analysis of past La Ni\u00f1a-to-El Ni\u00f1o transition years shows low-pressure tendencies over Europe with high-pressure zones over northern parts\n- A stratospheric warming event is currently starting and is forecast to impact late February and March weather\n\n**Note:** The article appears to be cut off mid-sentence and does not contain direct information about North Atlantic sea surface temperatures, which is the subject of the underlying Metaculus question.

Metaculus question 41595 \u2013 community-prediction history  \n  \n    \u2022  Only one concrete data point appears in the open web results: a community prediction (CP) of 20 percent on 2026-02-16 (`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\", \u2026}` embedded in the context).  \n    \u2022  No public-facing chart or cached copy of earlier CP values for Q41595 surfaced in the retrieved sources. The usual place to see the full time-series is the \u201cCommunity Prediction\u201d chart on the Metaculus question page itself, but that image is generated client-side and does not get indexed by search engines, so third-party pages rarely mirror it.  \n    \u2022  Because no older CP snapshots were captured in the search results, quantitative reconstruction of the history (e.g., the trajectory since question launch) is not presently possible from the material provided.  \n  \n    Information gap: dates and percentages of prior CP changes (e.g., opening value, maxima/minima, inflection points) are still missing. These are needed if one wants to document how the crowd\u2019s belief has evolved ahead of the 2026-02-28 evaluation date.  \n\n2.  Latest North Atlantic daily SST data up to 2026-02-17  \n  \n    \u2022  Climate Reanalyzer\u2019s interactive \u201cNorth Atlantic \u2022 Daily Mean SST\u201d page (ClimateReanalyzer.org, University of Maine) is the designated reference in the original Metaculus question and remains the most convenient public display of the NOAA OISST v2.1 daily series (ClimateReanalyzer source).  \n    \u2022  The page itself was captured in the results, but the text scrape does not include the actual numeric entries. Nonetheless, meta-information on that page tells us:  \n      \u2013 All values are NOAA OISST area-weighted means for 0\u201360\u00b0 N, 80\u00b0 W\u20130\u00b0 E.  \n      \u2013 Preliminary (last ~14 days) are marked with dots; the rest are finalized.  \n  \n    \u2022  Secondary news coverage corroborates that North-Atlantic SSTs have been anomalously warm since 2023 and stayed \u201crecord-high for the month\u201d in parts of 2024 and early 2025 (Copernicus write-up on April 2025 SSTs \u2013 TheFederal, 08 May 2025).  \n  \n    \u2022  The background section of the Metaculus problem statement itself notes that \u201cNorth Atlantic Sea Surface Temperatures have started out high in 2026, but have so far been lower than during 2025.\u201d  This qualitative statement implies that, through at least mid-February 2026, the daily curve for 2026 is running below the record-shattering path 2025 set last year.  \n  \n    \u2022  No result in the set gives the exact value for 2026-02-17, but ClimateReanalyzer\u2019s chart (when consulted directly) normally updates with a one-to-two-day delay; as of 2026-02-17 the finalized value is typically available. Users of the Metaculus question would look for a coloured trace labelled \u201c2026\u201d and compare it day-by-day against earlier annual traces.  \n  \n    \u2022  Because 2025 produced the all-time high (~27 \u00b0C) in mid-September and also day-of-year records throughout February\u2013April 2025, the threshold for the Metaculus resolution window (Feb 1 \u2013 Apr 30 2026) is each individual calendar-day record.  The statement that 2026 is \u201clower than during 2025\u201d up to mid-February means that, so far, the 2026 trace has not exceeded the same-day values logged in 2025, and therefore no new record has yet been set before 2026-02-17.  \n  \n    Interim conclusion on records: On or before 17 February 2026, North-Atlantic OISST values are elevated relative to the 1982-2020 climatology but still below the unprecedented 2025 curve.  Hence 2026 values are \u201cnearing\u201d but not \u201csurpassing\u201d the standing daily records.  \n  \n    Remaining quantitative gap: the exact \u00b0C reading for 2026-02-17, plus a tabulation of 2026-to-date versus prior-year day-of-year records, are absent from the search results.  Those numbers would be required for a fully numeric comparison.  \n\n3.  Synthesis with forecasting context  \n  \n    \u2022  For the binary forecast that asks whether the CP on 2026-02-28 will be \u201c> 20 %\u201d, the single known CP datapoint is exactly 20 %.  \n    \u2022  The crowd\u2019s probability will presumably react to daily SST prints in the second half of February.  The fact that 2026 SSTs are currently below the same-day records tends to keep the perceived chance of \u201crecord before May 1\u201d low, which is consistent with a CP at or just under 20 %.  \n    \u2022  Any sudden spike in the SST trace above 2025 figures during the last ten days of February could push the CP above the 20 % threshold; conversely, continued sub-record readings or a cooling anomaly would keep or push the CP lower.  Therefore, up-to-date numeric SST data and a full CP time-series remain critical for monitoring forward changes.  \n\n4.  Identified information gaps  \n  \n    a. Metaculus Q41595: full historical community-prediction time-series (date & %).  \n    b. North Atlantic OISST values for every day of 2026 through 2026-02-17 (ideally a CSV or JSON dump) and the running list of calendar-day records so one can state exactly how close 2026 readings are to the record curve in \u00b0C terms.  \n  \n    Filling those gaps would allow a precise answer to \u201cIs 2026 nearing or surpassing previous records?\u201d and a quantitative narrative of how the Metaculus community has digested the SST data so far.</Agent_report>\n"
