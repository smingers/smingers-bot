It does not contain forecasts, opinions, or current statistics about North Atlantic temperatures.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://acp.copernicus.org/articles/24/13681/2024/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Warming effects of reduced sulfur emissions from shipping\"\n\n**Source:** Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics (Copernicus)\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Regulation Impact (2020):** The IMO regulation introduced in 2020 limiting sulfur content in shipping fuel reduced sulfur emissions over global open oceans by approximately **80%**.\n\n2. **Historical Shipping Emissions:** \n   - Ships emit around **10-13 Tg yr\u207b\u00b9 of SO\u2082**, accounting for about **14% of global SO\u2082 emissions** from all sectors\n   - Pre-2020: Maximum fuel sulfur content was **3.5%**\n   - Post-2020: Reduced to **0.5%** (outside special control areas)\n\n3. **Global Aerosol Forcing:**\n   - The global aerosol effective radiative forcing (ERF) from reduced shipping emissions: **0.13 W m\u207b\u00b2** (with interannual standard deviation of 0.016)\n   - This represents an additional **~50% to the net positive forcing** from the reduction in all anthropogenic aerosols from late-20th century to pre-2020 era\n   - Based on comparison: 1990-2020 aerosol ERF from all sources was 0.25 W m\u207b\u00b2\n\n4. **Temperature Projections:**\n   - Global mean warming predicted: **0.04 K** averaged over 2020-2049 period\n   - Arctic warming: Mean of **0.15 K** Arctic-wide\n   - Atlantic sector of Arctic: **0.3 K** (representing **>10% increase** in total anthropogenic warming since pre-industrial times)\n\n5. **Model Details:** Study used HadGEM3-GC3.1-LL climate model with 12-member ensembles comparing scenarios with and without the 2020 shipping emission reductions\n\n6. **Sulfate Burden Reduction:** Global mean reduction of **0.14 mg m\u207b\u00b2**, corresponding to **4.6%** of the baseline scenario\n\n## Key Interpretations from Authors:\n\n- The simulations are \"not clear on whether the global impact is yet to emerge or has already emerged because the present-day impact is masked by variability\"\n- The impact \"either will have already committed us to warming above the 1.5 K Paris target or will represent an important contribution that may help explain part of the rapid jump in global temperatures over the last 12 months\"\n- Strongest warming effects observed in: tropical eastern Indian Ocean to western Pacific, Mediterranean region, eastern North America, and Atlantic Ocean north of 60\u00b0N\n\n## Regional Patterns:\n\n- Statistically significant warming emerged in 2030s and 2040s in specific regions\n- Pattern resembling La Ni\u00f1a observed: warming in tropical eastern Indian Ocean to western Pacific, cooling in central to eastern Pacific\n- Changes associated with strengthening of Walker circulation\n</QuestionSource>\n\n<QuestionSource url=\"https://www.npr.org/2024/08/14/nx-s1-5051849/hot-oceans-climate-science\">\n# Summary of NPR Article: \"The oceans are weirdly hot. Scientists are trying to figure out why\"\n\n**Date:** August 14, 2024  \n**Author:** Rebecca Hersher\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- Worldwide average ocean temperatures were in record-breaking territory for 15 months straight starting from April 2023\n- Abnormally hot ocean water fuels dangerous hurricanes (examples cited: Hurricane Ernesto expected to rapidly strengthen in August 2024, Hurricane Debby dumped massive rain on East Coast)\n- Ocean water near Florida is so warm it's threatening coral reefs\n- In 2020, new international shipping regulations required ships to use cleaner fuel with less sulfur pollution\n- The Hunga Tonga-Hunga Ha'apai volcanic eruption occurred in 2022 off the coast of Tonga\n- The sun's energy output changes by about 0.1% over its 11-year solar cycle, causing Earth's global temperatures to change by a little less than 0.1 degree Celsius\n\n## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):\n\n**Andrew Dessler (climate scientist, Texas A&M):**\n- \"The two primary things are obviously global warming and El Ni\u00f1o\"\n- Oceans are even warmer than expected from these two trends alone\n- Was \"very skeptical\" of the volcanic warming effect\n- Notes the Hunga-Tonga eruption changed total atmospheric water vapor very little\n- Predicts: \"My guess is, in the end, it's just going to be internal variability. Like, something weird happened! Because the climate's always doing something weird.\"\n- \"The next few months will tell us if we've really broken the climate\"\n\n**Stephen Smith (air pollution and climate change expert, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory):**\n- On cleaner shipping fuel: \"This saves lives\"\n- Acknowledges sulfur pollution was reflecting some of the sun's heat\n\n**Andrew Gettelman (climate scientist, Pacific Northwest National Laboratory):**\n- Co-author of forthcoming study on ship pollution effects\n- \"This could be contributing to the warm temperatures we've seen in the last couple years\" (referring to reduced ship pollution)\n- \"We're going to see the planet warm in fits and starts\"\n- Notes there was a period in the 2010s when Earth didn't warm much, but it was temporary\n- \"I think people are starting to get a little worried that we are warming at the high end of what [climate models predicted]\"\n\n**Gregory Kopp (solar physicist, University of Colorado, Boulder):**\n- \"The sun isn't causing the recent record-breaking sea-surface temperatures\"\n- \"The sea contains so much heat energy that it doesn't respond on the relatively short solar-cycle timescales\"\n\n## Main Theories Explored:\n\n1. **Climate change and El Ni\u00f1o** (confirmed contributors): Fossil fuel burning releases heat-trapping gases absorbed by oceans; El Ni\u00f1o was active in 2023 and early 2024\n\n2. **Cleaner shipping fuel** (likely contributor): Reduced sulfur pollution means fewer reflective clouds, allowing more solar heat to reach ocean surface. Research suggests this is contributing to warming.\n\n3. **Hunga-Tonga volcanic eruption** (ruled out): Despite initial speculation about water vapor acting as greenhouse gas, recent research suggests this is NOT a significant factor\n\n4. **Solar activity** (ruled out): Changes in sun's output don't account for abnormal ocean temperatures\n\n5. **Natural variability/\"weirdness\"** (possible contributor): Normal year-to-year climate variability could account for extra warming when layered on top of other factors\n\n## Key Uncertainty:\n\nScientists don't know for sure what's driving ocean temperatures into record-breaking territory beyond climate change and El Ni\u00f1o. The real concern is whether the overall warming trend is accelerating, which will become clearer in the coming months.\n</QuestionSource>\n"
