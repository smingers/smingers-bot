8. **StreetInsider/Mizuho (Sep 29, 2025)**: Dated analyst note from 5 months ago maintaining Outperform/$37 target. Too old for 5-day forecast. **Quality: Moderate but obsolete.**

**Key Factual Finding**: The Investopedia article reveals that **on Feb 18 itself** (the comparison date), CCL surged 8%+ on strong earnings and guidance. This is a massive same-day catalyst that occurred at the START of our measurement period.

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Feb 18 earnings beat and 8% surge**: Multiple sources confirm strong Q4 results, raised FY26 guidance, and dividend reinstatement announced Feb 18. This created significant positive momentum entering our forecast window. The stock closed Feb 18 at approximately $33.08 (per outside view) after an 8% jump.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Sector momentum**: Peers RCL (+3%) and NCLH (+6%) also rose Feb 18, confirming industry-wide strength.
- **Fuel/FX tailwinds**: $0.20/share benefit in FY26 per Zacks analysis provides fundamental support.
- **Valuation**: Forward P/E of 12-13x is below industry average, suggesting room for multiple expansion.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Oil price headwind**: 7% rise in oil MTD could pressure margins, but this is already known and didn't prevent the Feb 18 surge.
- **Mean reversion risk**: Stock near 52-week high, but the Feb 18 catalyst may have reset the technical picture.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction timeframe**: 5 trading days (Feb 19-25, 2026).

**Critical insight**: The question asks if Feb 25 close will be higher than Feb 18 close. Feb 18 was a major positive catalyst day (+8%). The comparison baseline is therefore an already-elevated price following good news.

**If timeframe were halved (2-3 days)**: Immediate post-earnings momentum would likely persist, increasing probability of higher prices (perhaps 60-65%).

**If timeframe were doubled (10 days)**: More time for profit-taking and mean reversion after the 8% pop, potentially reducing probability to 50-55%.

The 5-day window sits in a zone where initial momentum could persist but profit-taking could also emerge.

**(d) Justification:**

**Starting point**: Outside view base rate of 55% (based on historical 56% weekly positive rate, adjusted down slightly for mean-reversion risk).

**Major adjustment factors**:

1. **Feb 18 catalyst (+8% surge)**: This is a double-edged sword. On one hand, it shows strong fundamental momentum. On the other, it means we're measuring from an elevated baseline immediately after a major move. Post-earnings drift literature suggests stocks often consolidate or pull back in the week following large earnings surprises.

2. **Comparison baseline effect**: We're not asking "will CCL rise from Feb 17 to Feb 25?" but rather "will it be higher on Feb 25 than on the post-surge Feb 18 close?" This makes the hurdle higher.

3. **Short-term technical**: An 8% single-day move often leads to some profit-taking in subsequent sessions. However, the move was fundamentally justified (not speculative), which supports stickiness.

4. **Sector context**: Cruise stocks collectively strong, suggesting industry-wide re-rating rather than CCL-specific speculation.

**Net adjustment**: The Feb 18 surge is the dominant factor. While it shows strength, it also means the comparison price is elevated. Historical patterns suggest a 50-60% chance of holding gains after a major positive catalyst day over a 5-day window. The strong fundamentals (guidance raise, dividend) argue for the higher end of this range.

**Adjusted probability**: 55% base rate + 3% for strong fundamentals and sector momentum - 2% for elevated comparison baseline = **56%**

**Probability Calibration:**

The outside view established a 55% base rate for weekly positive moves. The critical new information is that Feb 18 itself was a major up-day (+8%) on strong earnings. This creates a challenging comparison: we need Feb 25 to exceed an already-elevated Feb 18 close.

Post-earnings behavior studies show that after large positive surprises, stocks have roughly a 55-60% chance of being higher 5 days later (accounting for both continued momentum and profit-taking). The strong guidance ($3.5B net income, dividend reinstatement) and sector tailwinds support the higher end.

However, I must avoid overconfidence. An 8% move captures significant good news, and the stock was already near 52-week highs before the jump. Some consolidation is natural.

**Final calibrated probability: 56%**

This reflects:
- Modest positive tilt from strong fundamentals
- Recognition that the comparison baseline is post-surge
- Acknowledgment of mean-reversion risk after large moves
- Sector momentum as a supporting factor

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Carnival (CCL) close higher on Feb 25, 2026 than its Feb 18, 2026 close (~$33.08)?

2. **Base rate**: 55% from historical weekly positive rate, adjusted for near-term factors.

3. **Consistency**: "56 out of 100 times, CCL closes higher on Feb 25 than Feb 18." This aligns with a modest positive tilt following strong earnings but acknowledges consolidation risk.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Feb 18: +8% surge on earnings beat and raised FY26 guidance ($3.5B net income)
   - Dividend reinstatement signals confidence
   - Sector strength (RCL +3%, NCLH +6% same day)
   - Forward P/E 12-13x below industry average
   - Comparison baseline is post-surge elevated price

5. **Blind spot**: If profit-taking accelerates or if macro data (consumer confidence, housing) disappoints during the week, CCL could give back 2-4% of the Feb 18 gains, falling below the comparison price. This would shift probability to ~45%.

6. **Status quo**: The immediate status quo is post-earnings strength. A slight nudge toward 50-50 is appropriate given the elevated baseline, but fundamentals support holding above 50%.

**Probability: 56%**
