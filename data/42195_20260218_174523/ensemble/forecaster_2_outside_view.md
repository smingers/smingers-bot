(b) **Reference Class Analysis:**

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **CCL weekly price movements (past 12 months):** 252 trading days = ~50 weeks. Agent report shows 55% up-days with +0.4% average weekly return. Highly relevant as it captures CCL-specific volatility patterns.

2. **S&P 500 Consumer Discretionary weekly movements:** Broader sector context but less specific to cruise industry dynamics and CCL's high beta (2.44).

3. **One-week price movements during earnings blackout periods:** CCL's next earnings is ~3/20/2026, so 2/18-2/25 falls in a quiet period. Relevant but limited historical sample.

4. **Cruise sector peer movements (RCL, NCLH):** Useful for sector sentiment but each company has unique characteristics.

**Most suitable:** CCL's own weekly price movements over the past 12 months. This captures the stock's specific volatility, beta, and trading patterns while providing sufficient sample size (50+ weeks).

(c) **Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction window:** 5 trading days (2/19-2/25 vs. 2/18 baseline)

**Historical patterns:**
- Agent report: 55% of days were up-days over past year (139/252)
- For 5-day periods, assuming independence: probability of net gain ≈ 52-56% based on drift
- Recent momentum: Stock up from $31.77 (2/13) to $33.08 (2/18) = +4.1% in 3 trading days
- Volatility: Standard deviation $4.46 on mean $26.55 = 16.8% annualized volatility
- 5-day expected movement: ~$0.13-0.26 based on historical drift

**Seasonal context:** February is "wave season" for cruise bookings, historically positive for sentiment. Multiple sources confirm record 2026 bookings.

**Recent price action:** 
- 2/18 opened $32.16, closed $33.08 (+2.9% intraday)
- Strong upward momentum from late January lows ($28-29)
- Currently near 52-week high ($34.03 on 2/6/2026)

(d) **Justification:**

**Base rate factors favoring "Yes" (price rises):**
1. Historical 55% up-day frequency suggests slight bullish bias
2. Recent momentum: +4.1% over 3 days (2/13-2/18)
3. Strong fundamentals: Record bookings, 12% earnings growth guidance for 2026
4. Positive analyst sentiment: Majority buy ratings, $38 average target vs. $33 current
5. Wave season timing typically positive for cruise stocks
6. Sector strength: Peers RCL and NCLH also rallying

**Base rate factors favoring "No" (price falls or flat):**
1. Stock near 52-week high ($34.03), potential resistance
2. Oil prices rising (+9.4% month-over-month WTI), margin pressure concern
3. Dense macro calendar (FOMC minutes 2/19, Consumer Confidence 2/24) creates volatility risk
4. CFO share sale executed around 2/10 may have dampened sentiment
5. High beta (2.44) means amplified downside in risk-off scenarios
6. Recent EPS estimate revisions downward (per Globe and Mail)

**Integration:**
The 5-day window is short enough that momentum and technical factors dominate over fundamentals. CCL has positive drift (+0.4% weekly average) and recent strong momentum. However, proximity to 52-week highs and rising oil prices create headwinds. The macro calendar is event-heavy, introducing tail risks.

The stock's 55% historical up-day frequency over 252 days provides a strong anchor. For a 5-day period, the probability of a net gain (comparing 2/25 close to 2/18 close) should be slightly higher than 50% due to positive drift, but tempered by current technical position and macro risks.

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring considerations:**
- Raw historical frequency: 55% up-days
- For multi-day periods with drift: ~52-57% probability of net gain
- Current momentum is strong (+4.1% in 3 days), suggesting continuation probability elevated
- However, mean reversion from 52-week high proximity reduces this
- Macro event density adds symmetric volatility risk

**Calibration adjustments:**
- Start with 55% base rate from historical data
- Add +3% for recent momentum and wave season timing
- Subtract -2% for proximity to resistance and oil price concerns
- Subtract -1% for macro event risk in a high-beta stock

**Upset rate consideration:**
In equity markets over 5-day windows, unexpected outcomes occur frequently (30-40% of the time predictions fail). This suggests avoiding extreme confidence. The 55-58% range reflects meaningful uncertainty while acknowledging the slight bullish tilt.

**Tethering to sources:**
- Agent report's 55% up-day frequency is the most concrete statistical anchor
- No source provides explicit 5-day forward probabilities
- Analyst targets ($38 vs. $33) suggest 15% upside but over longer horizons
