Analysis:
1) Resolution criteria (what exactly resolves)
This resolves “Yes” iff CCL’s Yahoo Finance close on 2026-02-25 is strictly higher than CCL’s Yahoo Finance close on 2026-02-18.

(a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality; facts vs opinions)
- Yahoo Finance / Simply Wall St (Feb 15, 2026): Valuation write-up claiming ~39% undervaluation via a DCF (intrinsic value ~$52). Quality: decent as a structured model, but highly assumption-driven; not a short-horizon (5 trading days) predictor. Facts: recent price moves, FCF figures. Opinions/model outputs: “undervalued,” intrinsic value.
- Finviz / Zacks promo (date not specified in snippet, but current): “Top value stock,” Zacks Rank upgrades, forward P/E, estimate revisions. Quality: Zacks is identifiable, but this is promotional/marketing framing; still useful for sentiment. Facts: estimate revision counts, consensus EPS changes. Opinion: “should be on investors’ shortlist.”
- Macrotrends (Feb 17, 2026): Price history and YTD stats (e.g., close $32.68 on 2/17; 52-week high ~$34.03). Quality: generally reliable for historical price context; good for “where are we in the range?” Facts: historical closes, highs/lows.
- Investopedia (Feb 18, 2026): Reports strong results/guidance narrative; notes a large one-day surge and dividend reinstatement. Quality: reputable secondary reporting; good for “what just happened” and sentiment. Facts: EPS/revenue vs estimates, guidance, dividend amount. Interpretation/opinion: “phenomenal year” framing, bullish read-through.
- TradingView carrying Zacks (Feb 16, 2026): Discusses FY26 tailwinds (fuel/FX) and cost pressures; provides forward P/E comparisons and Zacks rank. Quality: mixed—Zacks is identifiable and quant-ish, but still a commentary piece. Facts: stated tailwind/cost headwind numbers (as estimates), relative valuation multiples. Opinion: rank-based bullishness.
- Yahoo Finance (Jan 29, 2026): Explains a prior jump tied to peer Royal Caribbean’s strong bookings; shows the cruise-industry-demand narrative. Quality: good contextual reporting, but not directly about the 2/18–2/25 micro-window. Facts: price move, booking-week claims attributed to RCL.
- AskNews “Stockpulse” items: Mostly irrelevant ticker collisions (e.g., CCL.NS, CCL-A.TO, Cuscal CCL.AX) not Carnival (NYSE: CCL). Quality for this question: not usable; they do not describe the target ticker/resolution source.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted to the resolution)
Baseline is a short 5-trading-day directional move; fundamentals matter mainly insofar as they influence near-term sentiment/flows.

Strong evidence (large potential impact)
- “Post-news jump / near-term positioning risk” from Investopedia Feb 18: a big positive catalyst appears to have just been digested. Mechanism: after a sharp up-move, 1-week outcomes have elevated two-sided volatility and non-trivial pullback risk (profit-taking, “sell-the-news”). This cuts against naively extrapolating the longer-term bullish fundamentals into the 2/25 close.

Moderate evidence (moderate shifts)
- Clear bullish fundamental/sentiment stack (multiple sources): guidance above consensus, dividend reinstatement, positive booking/demand narrative, and analysts broadly constructive (Zacks ranks, target prices). Mechanism: supports bid on dips and positive drift, but a lot may already be in the price after the surge.
- Technical/location in range (Macrotrends): CCL is near the upper end of its 52-week range (~$34 high recently). Mechanism: nearby resistance/overbought conditions modestly reduce “up again next week” odds versus a mid-range stock.

Weak evidence (small shifts)
- DCF “undervaluation” (Simply Wall St): likely irrelevant to a 1-week horizon; can support general bullish narrative but shouldn’t move a 5-day probability much.
- Fuel/FX tailwinds (Zacks via TradingView): real, but FY26-wide; weak for a one-week direction call unless oil/FX itself moves sharply in the window (unknown).

Net evidence balance for 2/18 → 2/25:
- Positive: supportive sentiment + industry demand + constructive guidance/dividend.
- Negative: the catalyst appears recent and large, raising short-horizon mean-reversion/profit-taking risk; plus price is near the top of its recent range.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left: 7 calendar days, about 5 U.S. trading days (from the 2/18 close to the 2/25 close).
- If halved (~2–3 trading days): I’d tilt slightly lower than my final number because immediate post-pop churn/mean-reversion dominates very short windows.
- If doubled (~10 trading days): I’d tilt slightly higher because the supportive fundamentals/guidance and sector narrative have more time to assert themselves beyond the initial “sell-the-news” noise.

(d) Justification (inside-view adjustment vs outside-view base rate)
Outside view base rate was 56% for “2/25 close > 2/18 close,” anchored on historical up-frequency/drift plus modest momentum.

Inside-view updates:
- Downward adjustment (main): Investopedia indicates a very large bullish repricing around 2/18 tied to results/guidance/dividend. Big up-days often increase the chance that the next week is flat-to-down (profit-taking), especially near recent highs. This makes the reference class (“ordinary week”) somewhat less analogous: we’re coming off a notable catalyst move.
- Upward adjustment (partial offset): multiple sources support that the move is not purely speculative—guidance/dividend and strong cruise demand are real and could create continued positive drift.

Overall, I reduce the outside-view 56% modestly (not drastically) because (1) the horizon is short and noisy, and (2) “big pop then fade” is common enough to shave a couple points, but (3) the fundamental news is meaningfully positive, preventing a large drop in probability.

Probability calibration
- Outside view: 56%
- Adjustment for post-catalyst jump / near-high mean reversion risk: -4 pp
- Adjustment back for genuinely positive fundamentals/sector tailwinds: +2 pp
Inside view forecast: 54%

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase/resolution: “Will CCL’s 2026-02-25 Yahoo close be higher than its 2026-02-18 Yahoo close?”
2) Outside view base rate: 56%.
3) Consistency check: “54 out of 100 times, CCL’s 2/25 close is higher than its 2/18 close.” Plausible for a slightly-bullish-but-choppy post-pop week.
4) Key evidence (most significant):
   - Large bullish catalyst move around 2/18 increases near-term profit-taking/mean-reversion risk.
   - Guidance/dividend reinstatement + strong demand narrative supports continued bullish sentiment.
   - Price is near the top of its recent/52-week range, adding resistance risk.
5) Blind spot: A broad market risk-on rally (or continued cruise-sector melt-up) could overpower mean reversion → would push probability meaningfully higher.
6) Status quo outcome: Short-horizon stock moves are close to coin-flips; staying near ~50–55% is appropriate.

Probability: 54%
