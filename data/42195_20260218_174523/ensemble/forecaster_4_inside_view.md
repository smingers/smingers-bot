Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance / Simply Wall St (15 Feb 26) – factual price/DCF data, reputable, 3 days old. Mostly valuation opinion (bullish).  
2. Zacks / Finviz (no date stamp but cached 17 Feb 26) – analyst-rating table, reliable for rankings, promotional tone.  
3. Macrotrends (17 Feb 26) – historical closes; raw data, high quality.  
4. Investopedia (18 Feb 26) – news on 8 % price pop after results; cites Carnival 4Q numbers and guidance; fact-checked quotes from filings/CC.  
5. Zacks note on fuel/FX tailwinds (16 Feb 26) – analyst interpretation of company guidance; single but identifiable source.  
6. StreetInsider / Mizuho (29 Sep 25) – older, still relevant for valuation context; high-quality sell-side note.  
7–15. AskNews “CCL” hits are mostly other tickers (CCL.NS, CCL-A.TO, etc.) or Hong-Kong “CCL” property index – none pertain to Carnival Corporation; ignored.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong:  
• Carnival’s Q4 FY 2025 beat and FY 2026 guide above consensus (SEC-filed numbers; multiple outlets confirm).  
• Dividend reinstatement after three-year pause → clear signalling of cash-flow strength.  
Moderate:  
• Fuel & FX expected to add ≈$0.20 EPS in FY 26 (Zacks).  
• Momentum – stock up ~25 % in 3 mo, ~8 % on 18 Feb intraday (Investopedia).  
• Analysts: Zacks Rank #1, multiple upward estimate revisions.  
Weak (ignored or minimal weight):  
• DCF target $52 (Simply Wall St) – long-horizon valuation, methodology opaque for 1-week horizon.  
• Macro oil prices, broad SPX drift – background only.  

Net evidence tilt: short-term sentiment and guidance surprises are positive but 5-day direction remains noisy; mean-reversion risk at 52-week high tempers strength.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome known in 5 trading days. If horizon were halved to 2–3 days, probability would move ~+1 pp toward random 50/50; if doubled to 10 days, positive factors could compound → +2 pp higher.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (historical 5-day “up” for CCL) = 53 %.  
Adjust upward 3-4 pp for:  
• Fresh earnings/guidance surprise and reinstated dividend (fundamental catalyst likely to keep bid support).  
• Sector-wide strength (RCL/NCLH also rallying) → positive spill-over.  
• Analyst estimate upgrades & strong buy ratings – signals continuing flow of optimistic research notes.  
Subtract 1-2 pp for:  
• Proximity to 52-week high increases odds of profit-taking.  
• Macro headline risk (FOMC minutes 19 Feb, CPI 21 Feb) could trigger sector pull-back.  

Net inside-view probability ≈ 58 %.

Probability calibration
Interpreted as: “58 out of 100 times, CCL will close higher on 25 Feb 26 than on 18 Feb 26.”  A ±10 pp change would require either a clear market-wide risk-off signal (drop to ~48 %) or an unexpected additional bullish catalyst (rise to ~68 %).

Checklist:
1. “Will CCL close higher on 25 Feb than on 18 Feb 2026?” – 5 trading-day binary test.  
2. Base rate used: 53 %.  
3. Consistency: 58/100 times criterion is met – matches narrative.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • 4Q 25 beat & above-consensus FY 26 guide.  
   • Dividend reinstatement after pandemic pause.  
   • 8 % price jump on 18 Feb confirming strong momentum.  
   • Zacks Rank #1 with estimate revisions upward.  
   • Stock sits near 52-week high (potential mean reversion).  
5. Blind-spot: sudden macro shock (e.g., Fed hawkish surprise) causing >5 % sector sell-off. Would flip call to <40 %.  
6. Status quo: absent new information, random walk with slight upward drift ~53 %.

Probability: 58%
