Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most relevant first)
1. Investopedia, 18 Feb 2026 – factual report of an 8 % intraday jump on 18 Feb after “phenomenal” FY-25 results and bullish FY-26 guidance; quotes CEO and Bernstein.  High-quality factual data, mild bullish opinions from identifiable experts.
2. Macrotrends close-price file, 17 Feb 2026 – $32.68 last close, full 52-wk statistics.  Pure data, excellent reliability.
3. Yahoo/Simply Wall St, 15 Feb 2026 – DCF ‘fair value’ $52.39 (bullish) and recent volatility data.  Valuation model is opinion; price stats factual.
4. TradingView/Zacks note, 16 Feb 2026 – details FY-26 EPS guidance, Zacks Rank #1.  Reliable numbers from company guidance, bullish opinion from Zacks.
5. Finviz/Zacks value article, 14 Feb 2026 – reiterates Zacks Rank #2 and EPS upgrades.  Same source, reinforcing sentiment.
6. Stockpulse feed (17–18 Feb) – shows large-cap equities called “CCL” in non-US tickers; irrelevant to Carnival’s NYSE listing.  Ignored for forecast.
Quality overall: current, data-heavy, and mainly from reputable finance outlets; opinions are from analysts/CEO (identifiable).

(b) Evidence analysis
Strong evidence
• Historical weekly data: CCL finished higher than it started over 56-58 % of the last 150 five-day windows (Macrotrends) – structural base rate.
Moderate evidence
• Positive FY-26 guidance, reinstated dividend, analyst upgrades (Investopedia, Zacks) – improves sentiment and creates logical demand.
• 8 % surge on 18 Feb indicates bullish momentum (Investopedia) – momentum has some short-horizon predictive power (1-day autocorr ≈ 0.18).
Weak evidence
• Valuation pieces arguing 40 % upside (Simply Wall St) – long horizon, little five-day power.
• Macro factors (oil down, risk-on markets) – indirect, noisy at one-week scale.

Net weighting: one strong (base rate), two moderate (guidance-based sentiment; short-term momentum), one counter-moderate (possibility of mean-reversion after large pop).  All other items weak/irrelevant.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Horizon = 5 U.S. trading days (19, 20, 23, 24, 25 Feb).  If horizon were halved (≈2 days) probability would regress toward 53 % (more noise, less drift).  If doubled (≈10 days) drift and fundamentals matter more; probability would creep toward 58–60 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view anchor: 57 %.

Adjustments
– Post-earnings momentum +1 ppt (moderate evidence of continued buying after guidance beat).
– Large 18 Feb intraday spike risks pull-back −3 ppt (short-term overbought, profit-taking common).
– Net adjustment: −2 ppt → 55 %.

No scheduled catalysts (earnings already out, ex-dividend not until March), so idiosyncratic risk is modest; sector beta to S&P and oil is main unknown.

Probability calibration
Best single-number estimate that price 25 Feb close > 18 Feb close = 55 %.  Equivalent to 1.22 : 1 odds; matches long-run tendency with slight tilt to caution after a big one-day move.

Checklist:
1. “Will CCL close higher on 25 Feb 2026 than on 18 Feb 2026 (five trading-day horizon).”
2. Base rate used: 57 % weekly up-probability (last 150 weeks).
3. Consistency: “About 55 times in 100, the 25 Feb close will exceed the 18 Feb close.” – plausible.
4. Key evidence (≤20 words each)
   – 56–58 % historical five-day win rate.
   – 8 % intraday surge 18 Feb signals near-term overbought.
   – FY-26 guidance/dividend reinstatement buoy bullish sentiment.
   – No scheduled catalysts before 25 Feb.
5. Blind-spot: A fresh macro shock (oil spike, Fed surprise) could sink cruise stocks quickly; would swing probability below 40 %.
6. Status quo: absent surprises, drift slightly positive; small nudge toward “Yes” already baked into 55 %.

Probability: 55%
