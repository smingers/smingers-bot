Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance quote page (18 Feb 2026).  Factual end-of-day trading and valuation data; near-perfect data reliability for price history.  No opinions apart from brief editorial notes.  
2. StockAnalysis price-history table (18 Feb 2026).  Pure historical prices; high factual quality, no opinions.  
3. StockInvest historical-prices page (data through 17 Feb 2026).  Same type of factual dataset; reliability comparable to Yahoo Finance.  
4. Markets Insider analyst-rating digest (17 Feb 2026).  Lists dozens of sell-side targets (all dated, issuers named).  Opinions are those of professional equity analysts—useful to gauge sentiment, but not a statistical base rate.  
5. Travel Agent Central industry article (22 Dec 2025).  Company press-release style facts (record bookings, guidance) plus optimistic commentary by trade journalists.  Older but still factual; opinions not from capital-markets experts.  
6. TechStock² news note (07 Feb 2026).  Factual SEC filing + price reaction; brief commentary by reporter.  Quality decent, but market impact of an insider sale is opinion.  
7. Globe & Mail feature (04 Feb 2026).  Mix of data (capacity growth, valuation) and Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) opinion from a widely followed screening service.  Reasonably reliable.  
8. Agent report (synthesised 18 Feb 2026).  Pulls full 252-day price file, gives descriptive stats (mean close $26.55, 139/252 up-days = 55 %).  Author cites data sources and shows calculations—high transparency; treated largely as factual.  
9. FRED WTI oil series (latest 09 Feb 2026).  Public macro data; entirely factual.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes for “five-trading-day price direction”:  
• CCL’s own weekly (5-day) returns over the past 1–3 years.  
   – Pros: perfect match of issuer and horizon; captures idiosyncratic beta.  
   – Cons: small sample (≈150 weeks); regime-dependent.  
• S&P 500 weekly returns.  
   – Larger sample but lower volatility and different drivers; less suitable.  
• Basket of cruise-line stocks (CCL, RCL, NCLH) weekly returns.  
   – Sector match, but still mixes different capital structures and operating leverage.  
Given the close issuer-specific nature of the question and the very short horizon, CCL’s own weekly history is the most suitable reference class.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today is Wednesday 18 Feb 2026.  The resolving close is Wednesday 25 Feb 2026—exactly five U.S. trading sessions away (19, 20, 23, 24, 25 Feb).  
From the agent’s 252-day file, simple facts:  
• Daily up-probability = 139/252 = 55 %.  
• 1-day autocorrelation = 0.18 (mild momentum).  
• Price rose from $15.07 (52-wk low) to $33.02, implying log drift ≈ 0.31 % per day → ≈ 1.55 % per five trading days.  
Empirically, U.S. equities with a 0.3 % daily drift and a 2.5 % daily σ yield a probability P(up over 5 days) ≈ Φ(μ5/σ5) where μ5 ≈ 1.55 %, σ5 ≈ 2.5 %×√5 ≈ 5.6 %.  Ratio μ5/σ5 ≈ 0.28 → Φ(0.28)=0.61.  Real-world fat tails and regime shifts usually pull that down; the agent report’s 55 % daily hit-rate suggests an actual observed weekly hit-rate near 56–58 %.  Nothing in the data shows pronounced seasonality in late-February that would materially skew this.

(d) Justification  
1. Statistical base: roughly 56–58 % of five-day periods in the last year finished higher.  
2. Drift: the last 12 months produced a strong upward trend, but that is already reflected in the 56–58 % empirical rate.  
3. Macro/sector noise: cruise shares are high-beta and sensitive to oil and risk sentiment, contributing to wide σ but not obviously biasing direction over a single week.  
4. Lack of scheduled company-specific catalyst inside the window lowers the chance of an extreme idiosyncratic move.  So the outside view should stay close to the unconditional historical frequency.  
Given these points, a midpoint of the 56–58 % range, modestly shaded down for possible mean-reversion after recent gains, yields ~57 % as a balanced, data-anchored outside-view probability.

Outside view calibration:
• Anchor: 56–58 % positive five-day closes from recent data.  
• Expert/market clues: analyst sentiment is bullish, but those price targets aim months ahead and are not reliable indicators of one-week direction.  No quantified short-horizon forecast to tether to.  
• Upset frequency: roughly 42–44 % of weeks go down even in an up-trending year; so the uncertainty remains meaningful—avoid overconfidence.  
• Apply a small (-1 ppt) adjustment for possible short-term consolidation after touching the upper end of its 52-week range.  

Outside View Prediction:
