# Summary of "Caribbean Capacity Surges, Can Carnival Defend Yields in 2026?"

**Source:** The Globe and Mail  
**Date:** February 04, 2026

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Caribbean Capacity Growth:**
   - Non-Carnival Caribbean cruise capacity will rise approximately 14% in 2026
   - Two-year capacity increase totals roughly 27%

2. **Carnival's 2026 Guidance:**
   - Forecasting normalized yield growth of around 3% for 2026
   - Approximately two-thirds of 2026 capacity already sold at historically high prices
   - Customer deposits ended 2025 at record levels

3. **Stock Performance:**
   - CCL shares gained 18.7% in the past three months (as of article date)
   - Industry average rise: 12.8% over same period

   - CCL trades at forward P/E ratio of 12.34x

   - Note: EPS estimates for fiscal 2026 have decreased in the past 30 days

6. **Zacks Rating:** CCL carries a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold)

## Key Strategic Points:

- **Management Strategy:** Carnival emphasizes revenue optimization over simply filling capacity, willing to sacrifice marginal occupancy to preserve pricing integrity
- **Supporting Factors:** Strong onboard spending trends and continued strength in close-in demand helped drive higher yields in late 2025
- **Diversification:** Broad brand portfolio and geographic mix (including European-sourced Caribbean sailings) provide flexibility

## Competitor Context:

- **Royal Caribbean (RCL):** Has outsized Caribbean exposure with new ships and expanding private destinations, but higher capacity growth could pressure yields
- **Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH):** Smaller fleet with heavier reliance on contemporary/premium brands; may be more exposed to promotional activity if market becomes crowded
- Carnival's comparatively modest capacity growth cited as a relative advantage

Peer-group snapshot (18 Feb 2026 close)

• Royal Caribbean (RCL) $323.56, −0.05 % d/d, still within 2 % of its all-time high (YCharts).  
• Norwegian Cruise Line (NCLH) $24.65, +2.3 % d/d and +21 % over the last four weeks, powered by Elliott’s 10 % activist stake (TradingEconomics).  
• S&P 500 Consumer-Discretionary ETF (XLY) closed 206.42, +0.7 % d/d (yFinance).  
→ Sector sentiment remains constructive; CCL’s 1-month return of +10 % slightly lags RCL (+17 %) but beats XLY (+6 %).

Fuel-cost context

Brent spot finished the last published session (9 Feb) at $71.19/bbl, +6.7 % MTD and the highest print since Aug-25 (YCharts; EIA calendar shows the next data point due at 12:00 ET on 18 Feb).  A $1 move in Brent equates to ≈ $0.03 impact on CCL EPS annually, so traders watch the barrel closely.

Scheduled catalysts that can move CCL between 18 Feb and 25 Feb 2026

Company/sector
• No Carnival earnings, investor-day or fleet updates scheduled in the window.  
• Norwegian Cruise Line governance developments after Elliott stake – potential press releases (unscheduled).  
• Re-listing simplification (consolidating CUK into CCL) remains “1H26”; any SEC filing could drop without notice.

Macro/market
Wed 18 Feb 14:00 ET – FOMC January minutes  
Wed 18 Feb 14:30 ET – EIA Weekly Petroleum Status (oil inventory & implied demand)  
Thu 19 Feb 08:30 ET – U.S. Advance Trade in Goods, Initial Jobless Claims  
Fri 20 Feb 10:00 ET – New-Home Sales  
Mon 23 Feb 10:00 ET – Factory Orders (Dec final)  
Tue 24 Feb 10:00 ET – Conference Board Consumer Confidence (Feb)  
Wed 25 Feb 07:00 ET – MBA Mortgage Apps; 10:30 ET – EIA Petroleum Status (covers week to 21 Feb)  

International / FX
Thu 19 Feb – UK Retail Sales (important for sterling revenue exposure)  
Fri 20 Feb – Bank of Korea & Central Bank of Turkey policy meetings  
Throughout week – several ECB Governing-Council speeches (euro bookings).

All of the above releases have a history of moving high-beta discretionary names and/or oil prices, thereby offering a channel to CCL volatility.

How the evidence bears on 18 Feb vs 25 Feb close

Bull case
1. 12-month price momentum and positive seasonality (wave-season bookings) intact.  
2. Activist overhang at NCLH keeps cruise narrative in the headlines.  
3. Options market (43 % implied vol, sub-1.0 put/call) shows limited fear of near-term downside.

Bear case
1. Brent up-trend could spark margin-compression worries, especially if EIA reports drawdowns.  
2. Macro calendar is dense; any growth scare would hit discretionary leisure first.  
3. No company-specific upside catalyst until the dividend pay-date (27 Feb, outside the window).

Net: statistical drift favours a modest upside (+0.4 % average weekly return over the past year), but macro and oil sensitivity argue for caution.  Absent a macro shock, historical tendency and sector momentum suggest the 25 Feb close is slightly more likely to exceed the 18 Feb close than not.

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
