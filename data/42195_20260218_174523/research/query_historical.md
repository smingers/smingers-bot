Analysis:
The question is a very short-horizon equity price comparison (seven calendar days).  To build an outside view we want to know:  

• How CCL’s share price has behaved in the recent past (daily closes, typical one-week volatility, momentum relative to the S&P 500 and to peers such as RCL, NCLH).  
• Any company-specific catalysts scheduled between 18 Feb 2026 and 25 Feb 2026 (e.g., earnings reports, traffic updates, debt refinancings, analyst conferences).  
• Sector-level or macro catalysts likely to move cruise stocks in a single week (oil-price swings, consumer-discretionary sentiment, possible Fed minutes release).  
Therefore, useful historical context includes: CCL’s price chart and beta, recent news about bookings or guidance changes, and the timing of the next earnings release.  Broader macro variables (e.g., crude-oil prices) can also matter, but company and sector news are usually more important on a one-week horizon.
