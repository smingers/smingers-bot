The rise was attributed to positive developments including a U.S.-China trade agreement, a stable Hong Kong stock market, strong new property sales, and expectations of interest rate cuts. The CCL surpassed the 141-point level for the first time since late June 2024, reaching its highest level in 71 weeks. Following two consecutive interest rate cuts by banks, market sentiment improved, and the easing of U.S.-China relations further supported short-term price momentum. The CCL\u2019s fourth-quarter target remains at 143.02 points, currently 1.30 points or 0.92% below. Since May 2025, when the 3-month HIBOR dropped and property prices bottomed out, CCL has risen 4.85% from the 135.16-point low during the week when the HIBOR was below the mortgage cap, representing a 2.96% increase in 2025. The index is now 5.06% higher than the 134.89-point low before the 2025 March fiscal budget, 4.31% higher than the 135.86-point low before the first rate cut in September 2024, and 25.93% below the historical peak of 191.34 in August 2021.

The tender for a residential land parcel at the junction of Wing Shun Street and Des Voeux Road in Tsuen Wan on November 14 will influence the secondary market, with its impact expected to reflect in the CCL report released in early December 2025. The CCL Mass index rose 0.92% to 143.04 points, the CCL (Small and Medium Units) rose 0.88% to 141.64 points, both reaching their highest levels in 72 weeks since late June 2024. The CCL (Large Units) rose 1.49% to 142.11 points, reaching a 40-week high since early February 2025.

The index remains the fourth-highest since August 2024, with a gap of 2.67 points (1.9%) from its fourth-quarter target of 143.02 points. According to Yang Ming-yi, Senior Executive Director at Centaline Property Research Department, the recent drop followed a surge in U.S.-China trade tensions in mid-October, which triggered global market volatility and pushed the Hang Seng Index below 26,000 points. However, confidence improved after the October 31 interest rate cut by banks and a significant consensus reached between the U.S. and Chinese heads of state, sustaining active market trading and a short-term upward price trend. CCL has risen 1.97% year-to-date, recovering from a low of 135.16 points in May when mortgage rates fell below the ceiling. It is now 4.05% higher than the March 2025 budget announcement low of 134.89 points and 3.3% above the September 2024 pre-rate-cut low of 135.86 points. However, it remains 26.65% below the 2021 August peak of 191.34 points. The CCL Mass index stood at 141.73 points (down 0.53% weekly), the sixth-highest since July 2024; CCL (Medium-Small Units) was at 140.41 points (down 0.55% weekly), also the sixth-highest since July 2024; and CCL (Large Units) fell to 140.03 points (down 1.27% weekly), ending a three-week streak of gains. According to Chan Hoi-chiu, Head of Research at Lai Ka Ge Property, the rate-cut effect continues, but sellers are becoming more rigid in pricing, with affordable units largely absorbed. Weekend viewings across 50 benchmark estates totaled 1,325 groups, a 0.4% decrease from the previous weekend's 1,330 groups, indicating stable but slightly declining demand at elevated levels.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 07, 2025 08:30 PM\nSource:[\u5373\u6642\u65b0\u805e instant news](https://news.mingpao.com/pns/%e7%b6%93%e6%bf%9f/article/20251108/s00004/1762533171294/ccl%e6%8c%89%e5%91%a8%e8%b7%8c0-67-%e6%83%9f%e9%80%a3%e7%ba%8c5%e5%91%a8%e5%ae%88140%e9%bb%9e%e5%a4%a7%e9%97%9c)\n\n**CCL Falls 0.58% Week-on-Week but Remains Second-Highest Since July 2024**\nThe Central Mainland Property Index (CCL) fell 0.58% week-on-week to 141.09 points, marking its second-highest level since late July 2024, according to data from Sun Hung Kai Properties' research department. The decline follows two consecutive weeks of gains, but the index remains stable above the 141-point level. The dip reflects market conditions during the week of September 29 to October 2, when the MTR's Tuen Mun District 16 Phase 1 project received 31 expressions of interest and the Hang Seng Index closed above 27,000 points for the first time in over four years. Since the resumption of interest rate cuts in September, market sentiment has improved, with stronger buyer confidence, strong new home sales, and active secondary market transactions. Expectations of further U.S. rate cuts by late October suggest a short-term stable-to-upward price trend remains intact. The fourth-quarter target for CCL is set at 143.02 points, currently 1.93 points or 1.37% away. Year-to-date, CCL has risen 2.51% from its May low of 135.16 points (when HIBOR fell below the mortgage cap rate), 4.60% from the March fiscal budget low of 134.89 points, and 3.85% from the September 2023 pre-rate-cut low of 135.86 points. The index remains 26.26% below its all-time high of 191.34 points in August 2021. Impact from upcoming property launches\u2014including Phase 1 of the Tin Shui Wai Po Lung III (138 units) on October 21 and 26, and Phase 2 of Woodis in Wan Chai (30 units) on October 25\u2014will likely be reflected in the CCL data released in mid-November 2025. The CCL Mass index fell 0.76% to 142.43 points, ending two weeks of gains but still at its second-highest level since late June 2024. The CCL (Small & Medium Units) dropped 0.71% to 140.98 points, also ending two-week gains, but remains at its second-highest level since late June 2024. The CCL (Large Units) rose 0.05% to 141.66 points, marking its third consecutive week of gains (up 2.02% over two weeks), reaching its highest level since early February 2025.

According to Yang Mingyi, Senior Executive Director of China Merchants Real Estate Research Department, despite a slight softening in second-hand property prices after three consecutive weeks of increases\u2014driven by new property launches, expectations of government housing incentives, and anticipation of interest rate cuts\u2014the CCL remains at a 60-week high since early August 2024. With rate cuts restarting, market sentiment has improved, boosting buyer confidence, and the short-term upward trend in property prices is expected to continue. The CCL's fourth-quarter target is set at 143.02 points, currently 3.08 points or 2.20% below. Since May 2025, when the HIBOR dropped, property prices began to bottom out and rise, with the CCL rising 3.54% from its May low of 135.16 points. Year-to-date, the index has risen 1.67% in 2025. The CCL is 3.74% higher than the 134.89-point low before the March 2025 fiscal budget, 3.00% higher than the 135.86-point low before the first rate cut in September 2024, and 26.86% below the historical peak of 191.34 points in August 2021.

The U.S. government shutdown on October 1 and the Hang Seng Index closing above 27,000 points on October 2\u2014its highest level in over four years\u2014will likely influence the local secondary market, with effects expected to reflect in the CCL data released in late October 2025. The CCL Mass index fell 0.45% to 141.24 points, ending three consecutive weekly gains, but remains at the third-highest level since early August 2024. The CCL (Small and Medium Units) dropped 0.43% to 139.90 points, also ending a three-week rise, and remains at the third-highest level in the same period.

He explained that the recent earnings update was fundamentally solid, yet the stock fell because \"the market is picking up softness\". Chaiken cited three main factors: (1) Street cost estimates for 2026 were too low by roughly 100 basis points; CCL disclosed a 100\u2011bp increase from incremental dry\u2011dock costs and a 50\u2011bp rise from the Celebration project, both of which were not reflected in Street models; (2) the high\u2011frequency (HF) positioning was slightly crowded, which is ironic given that CCL trades at about 8\u00d7 forward EBITDA and is the least expensive peer in the group; and (3) investors are hesitant about pricing in Q4 and FY26, overlooking the upcoming capital\u2011return inflection, inherent conservatism, strong 2026 booking commentary, and the ramp\u2011up of Celebration/Half Moon. Shares of Carnival closed at $30.62 on the previous trading day. The analyst\u2019s commentary is supported by the article\u2019s direct quotes and specific metrics such as the 100\u2011bp and 50\u2011bp cost adjustments, the 8\u00d7 forward EBITDA multiple, and the $30.62 closing price.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 29, 2025 09:27 PM\nSource:[StreetInsider.com](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/Mizuho+on+Carnival+(CCL):+Buying+Opportunity+on+Solid+Update+and+Misaligned+Expectations/25393052.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
