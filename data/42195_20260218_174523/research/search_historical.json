Activist overhang at NCLH keeps cruise narrative in the headlines.  \n3. Options market (43 % implied vol, sub-1.0 put/call) shows limited fear of near-term downside.\n\nBear case\n1. Brent up-trend could spark margin-compression worries, especially if EIA reports drawdowns.  \n2. Macro calendar is dense; any growth scare would hit discretionary leisure first.  \n3. No company-specific upside catalyst until the dividend pay-date (27 Feb, outside the window).\n\nNet: statistical drift favours a modest upside (+0.4 % average weekly return over the past year), but macro and oil sensitivity argue for caution.  Absent a macro shock, historical tendency and sector momentum suggest the 25 Feb close is slightly more likely to exceed the 18 Feb close than not.\n\nRemaining information gaps\n\n\u2022 None material: the full daily-close file, up-to-date Brent series, and peer closes are covered via Stockscan, YCharts and EIA/YCharts feeds cited above.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"DCOILWTICO\" query=\"DCOILWTICO\">\nFRED Economic Data: Crude Oil Prices: West Texas Intermediate (WTI) - Cushing, Oklahoma\nSeries ID: DCOILWTICO\nUnits: Dollars per Barrel\nFrequency: Daily\nLatest observation: 64.53 (2026-02-09)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=63.94, min=55.44, max=75.89\n- 5-year: mean=76.71, min=55.44, max=123.64\n- 10-year: mean=64.11, min=-36.98, max=123.64\n- All-time: mean=48.08, min=-36.98, max=145.31 (since 1986-01-02)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: +5.57 (+9.4%)\n- 3-month change: +3.59 (+5.9%)\n- 6-month change: +0.85 (+1.3%)\n- Year-over-year: 64.53 vs 71.32 (-9.5%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-23,60.70\n2026-01-26,60.46\n2026-01-27,62.04\n2026-01-28,62.75\n2026-01-29,64.77\n2026-01-30,64.50\n2026-02-02,61.60\n2026-02-03,62.62\n2026-02-04,64.56\n2026-02-05,62.90\n2026-02-06,63.77\n2026-02-09,64.53\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
