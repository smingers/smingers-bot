Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles from Outside View:**

1. **MLive (Feb 16, 2026)**: High-quality regional news source. **Factual**: State Department ordered ~1,400 nonprofit libraries to stop passport processing effective Feb 13, 2026. Bipartisan congressional response documented. Recent and highly relevant.

2. **The Passport Office Blog (Jan 30, 2026)**: Commercial service provider. Provides factual information about spring break timing and processing requirements, though promotional. Less relevant for predicting near-term search changes.

3. **VisaHQ (Feb 2, 2026)**: Commercial service. **Factual**: Government shutdown occurred but passport services continued. Shutdown ended before our forecast period - minimal relevance.

4. **Alaska Airlines (Jan 15, 2026)**: Official airline communication. **Factual**: TSA Confirm ID program launched Feb 1, 2026, costs $45 for non-REAL ID travelers. This is now 17 days old.

5. **ABC News (Recent to Feb 16)**: Major news outlet. **Factual**: Online passport renewal fully available, expecting 5M users annually. Processing time 6-8 weeks. Confirms system expansion.

**AskNews Articles:**

1. **Birmingham Mail (Feb 18, 2026)**: **Factual**: UK passport rule change effective Feb 25, 2026 for dual nationals. UK-specific, minimal US relevance.

2. **Ryanair/Birmingham Mail (Feb 18, 2026)**: UK airline policy change. Not relevant to US Google Trends.

3. **Multiple international articles** (Argentina, Poland, Nigeria, Ecuador, India, Russia): All describe passport/ID changes in their respective countries. Minimal direct impact on US Google Trends for "passport."

4. **Daily Record (Feb 17, 2026)**: UK-focused dual citizenship rules. Not US-relevant.

**Key Factual Events for US Context:**
- Feb 1, 2026: TSA Confirm ID fee ($45) implemented (17 days ago)
- Feb 13, 2026: Library passport processing shutdown (5 days ago)
- Feb 16, 2026: Bipartisan congressional response to library closure
- Feb 18, 2026: Current date; Google Trends value is 88
- Current baseline (Feb 16): Was 93 per question background

**Critical Observation**: The question states the current value on Feb 16 was 93, but the outside view analysis shows 88 on Feb 18. This 5-point drop in 2 days is significant context.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Library closure (Feb 13)**: Multiple independent sources (MLive, Times Now News) confirm 1,400 facilities shut down. Direct causal mechanism: reduced access → increased search for alternatives/information. Congressional response indicates significant public impact. However, this is now 5 days old and the initial spike may have already occurred (95-96 on Feb 16-17).

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **TSA Confirm ID fee**: Single reliable source (Alaska Airlines), but now 17 days old. Initial search spike likely already captured in earlier data.
- **Spring break timing**: Historical pattern shows increased passport interest late Feb/early March. Indirect causal link to searches.
- **Recent trend direction**: Value dropped from 93 (Feb 16) to 88 (Feb 18), suggesting post-spike normalization rather than continued increase.

**Weak Evidence:**
- International passport news: Multiple countries implementing changes, but these affect their domestic searches, not US "passport" searches.
- Online renewal expansion: Positive for processing but unclear impact on search volume direction.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: Feb 18 to Feb 26 (8 days)

**Current Position**: 
- Feb 18 value: 88
- Need to reach 92+ for "Increases" (>3 point gain)
- Need to stay 85-91 for "Doesn't change" (within 3 points)
- Need to drop to 84 or below for "Decreases" (>3 point loss)

**Critical Timing Factors:**
1. Library closure is 5 days old - typical news cycle peaks 2-4 days after breaking, suggesting we may be past peak interest
2. Weekend Feb 22-23 will dampen weekday search volumes
3. The drop from 93→88 over 2 days suggests momentum is downward, not upward
4. 8 days is sufficient time for mean reversion toward the 90-day average of 75.8

**If timeframe halved (4 days)**: Would increase probability of "Doesn't change" as less time for significant movement. Weekend effect wouldn't be captured.

**If timeframe doubled (16 days)**: Would increase probability of "Decreases" as mean reversion has more time to occur and news cycle fully exhausts.

## (d) Justification

**Factors Supporting "Increases" (from 88 to 92+):**
- Spring break urgency building
- Congressional pressure on library closure may generate additional news coverage
- Still 7 points above 90-day mean, but below recent peak

**However, critical counterfactors:**
- **The value already dropped from 93 to 88** in 2 days (Feb 16-18), indicating the library closure spike has already peaked and is reversing
- Library closure is now 5 days old - past typical peak news cycle
- TSA fee is 17 days old - well past initial discovery phase
- Weekend effect (Feb 22-23) will suppress searches
- Mean reversion pressure is strong (88 vs 75.8 average)

**Factors Supporting "Decreases" (from 88 to 84 or below):**
- Recent momentum is clearly downward (93→88 in 2 days)
- Weekend dampening effect
- News cycle exhaustion on library closure
- Strong mean reversion pull (88 is still 12 points above 90-day average)
- Post-spike normalization pattern is common

**Factors Supporting "Doesn't Change" (stays 85-91):**
- Moderate spring break interest may stabilize searches
- Some ongoing discovery of library closures
- 3-point threshold provides buffer zone

**Critical Assessment:**
The outside view base rates (41% increase, 29% no change, 30% decrease) were calculated without knowledge that the value had already dropped from 93 to 88. This 5-point drop in 2 days is a strong signal that:
1. The library closure spike has already occurred and peaked
2. Current momentum is downward, not upward
3. We're in the post-spike normalization phase

The question asks about change from Feb 18 (88) to Feb 26. Given:
- Downward momentum established
- Weekend suppression ahead
- News cycle aging
- Mean reversion pressure

The probability distribution should shift significantly toward "Decreases" and away from "Increases."

## Probability Calibration

**Base rates**: 41% increase, 29% no change, 30% decrease

**Adjustments for current evidence:**

1. **Recent trend is decisive**: The 93→88 drop over 2 days is strong evidence the spike has reversed. This is not speculation - it's observed data showing current momentum.

2. **News cycle timing**: At 5 days post-library closure, we're past typical peak interest. The congressional response (Feb 16) coincided with the peak (93), not the beginning of a new surge.

3. **Weekend effect**: Feb 22-23 will suppress searches, making it harder to reach 92+ and easier to drop to 84-.

4. **Mean reversion**: At 88 vs 75.8 average, there's strong pull downward, especially after a news-driven spike.

**Revised probabilities:**
- **Increases** (88→92+): The downward momentum and weekend effect make this unlikely. Reduce from 41% to 15%.
- **Doesn't change** (stays 85-91): The 3-point buffer and some spring break interest make this plausible. Increase from 29% to 35%.
- **Decreases** (88→84-): Strong downward momentum, weekend effect, mean reversion, and news exhaustion make this most likely. Increase from 30% to 50%.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Google Trends value for "passport" on Feb 26 be >3 points different from Feb 18 (currently 88)? Increases if 92+, decreases if 84-, no change if 85-91.

2. **Base rate**: Started with 41% increase, 29% no change, 30% decrease. Adjusted significantly based on observed 93→88 downward trend.

3. **Consistency check**: Most likely = Decreases (50%); Least likely = Increases (15%). This aligns with observed downward momentum from 93→88 and upcoming weekend suppression.

4. **Significant evidence**:
   - Value dropped 5 points (93→88) in 2 days - downward momentum established
   - Library closure is 5 days old - past typical news peak
   - Weekend Feb 22-23 will suppress search volume
   - Mean reversion pressure strong (88 vs 75.8 average)
   - TSA fee spike (17 days old) already absorbed

5. **Blind spot**: If a major new passport-related crisis emerges (e.g., processing system failure, new policy announcement, celebrity passport scandal), could drive unexpected spike. However, no indicators suggest this is imminent.

6. **Status quo**: Current trend is downward normalization after a spike. The status quo outcome is continued decline toward the mean, supporting "Decreases."

7. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs.
