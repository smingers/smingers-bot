Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles:**

1. **Condé Nast Traveler (Feb 27, 2024)**: High-quality travel publication discussing spring break 2024 trends. Shows 20% increase in international flight bookings requiring passports. However, this is 2 years old and provides limited direct relevance to Feb 2026 passport search patterns.

2. **The Passport Office Blog (Jan 30, 2026)**: Commercial passport service provider. Recent and relevant, emphasizing spring break as a busy passport season. Factual information about processing times and requirements, though promotional in nature.

3. **The Traveler (Feb 9, 2026)**: Recent article noting St. Thomas (no passport required for US citizens) is trending for spring break 2026. This could actually reduce passport search interest if domestic alternatives gain traction.

4. **MLive (Feb 16, 2026)**: High-quality news source. **Critical factual information**: State Department ordered ~1,400 nonprofit libraries to stop processing passport applications effective Feb 13, 2026. This is a major disruption occurring just days before our forecast window. Bipartisan lawmakers are pressuring reversal, indicating significant public impact.

5. **VisaHQ (Feb 2, 2026)**: Commercial service provider reporting on government shutdown. States passport services continued during the shutdown, which ended before our forecast period. Limited relevance.

6. **Times Now News (Feb 16, 2026)**: International news source covering the same library closure story. Confirms the Feb 13, 2026 effective date and congressional response.

**Agent Report:**
Comprehensive synthesis identifying two major developments:
- **TSA $45 Confirm ID fee** (effective Feb 1, 2026): New fee for flying without Real ID/passport
- **Library passport service shutdown** (effective Feb 13, 2026): Removes 1,400 acceptance facilities

The agent report provides excellent context on why these would drive searches. Quality appears high with specific dates and sources cited.

**Key Factual Events (not opinions):**
- Feb 1, 2026: TSA Confirm ID $45 fee goes into effect
- Feb 13, 2026: Nonprofit libraries ordered to stop passport processing
- Feb 16, 2026: Current Google Trends value is 95 (very high)
- Spring break season approaching (typically March-April)

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **8-day windows in passport Google Trends data (past 90 days)**: Most directly applicable. Shows 41% increase, 29% no change, 30% decrease for >3 point movements.

2. **Post-major policy announcement periods**: When significant passport-related policy changes occur, search interest typically spikes then gradually declines.

3. **Pre-spring break periods (late Feb/early March)**: Historical pattern shows increased passport interest as travel season approaches.

4. **Post-disruption periods**: When services are disrupted (like library closures), initial spike followed by normalization.

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: The 8-day window analysis from the Google Trends data provides the most empirically grounded baseline, but must be heavily adjusted for the unprecedented recent events (library closures on Feb 13, TSA fee on Feb 1).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: Feb 18 - Feb 26, 2026 (8 days)

**Current Context (Feb 18, 2026)**:
- Current value: 88 (as of Feb 18)
- Baseline comparison value (Feb 18): Need to check verification URL
- Recent trend: Values were 95 (Feb 16), 96 (Feb 17), 88 (Feb 18)
- The question asks about change from Feb 18 to Feb 26

**Key Temporal Factors:**
1. **Library closure is only 5 days old** (Feb 13): Media coverage and public awareness still building
2. **TSA fee is 17 days old** (Feb 1): Initial spike likely already occurred, but ongoing discovery continues
3. **Spring break approaching**: Typically drives passport searches in late Feb/March
4. **President's Day weekend just passed** (Feb 17): Often triggers travel planning

**Historical Pattern from Data:**
- Jan 20-21: Peak at 98/95 (possibly related to initial TSA fee coverage)
- Gradual decline to 66 (Feb 8)
- Recovery to 95-96 (Feb 16-17) - likely library closure news breaking
- Current: 88 (Feb 18)

## (d) Justification

**Factors Supporting "Increases":**
1. **Library closure is very recent** (Feb 13): News cycle typically peaks 3-7 days after policy implementation as affected individuals discover the change
2. **Media amplification**: Bipartisan congressional response (Feb 16) generates additional news coverage
3. **Spring break urgency**: Late February is prime passport application period
4. **Compounding effects**: TSA fee + library closures create multiple search triggers
5. **Current value (88) is below recent peak** (95-96), suggesting room for increase

**Factors Supporting "Decreases":**
1. **Already at elevated level**: Recent spike to 95-96 may represent peak reaction
2. **Weekend effect**: Feb 22-23 (Saturday-Sunday) typically show lower search volumes
3. **News fatigue**: Initial shock of library closures may fade
4. **Mean reversion**: 90-day average is 75.8; current 88 is elevated

**Factors Supporting "Doesn't Change":**
1. **Stabilization after spike**: Value dropped from 96 to 88, suggesting settling
2. **Competing news cycles**: Other events may dilute passport-related attention

**Critical Assessment:**
The library closure on Feb 13 is the most significant recent event. The typical pattern for service disruptions shows:
- Initial spike when news breaks (Feb 16-17: 95-96)
- Brief pullback (Feb 18: 88)
- Secondary wave as more people discover impact (Feb 19-26)

The 8-day window from Feb 18-26 captures the period when:
- Working families attempt to book appointments and discover closures
- Media coverage continues (congressional pressure ongoing)
- Spring break urgency intensifies

Given the current value is 88 and needs to move >3 points (to 92+) to qualify as "Increases," this seems achievable given the recency and significance of the disruption.

## Outside view calibration:

**Base Rate from Data**: 41% increase, 29% no change, 30% decrease

**Adjustments for Current Context:**

1. **Unprecedented disruption**: The library closure affects 1,400 facilities and is generating bipartisan congressional response. This is not a typical week.

2. **Timing factors**: 
   - Only 5 days post-implementation (peak discovery period ahead)
   - Spring break urgency building
   - Weekend effect will dampen but not eliminate searches

3. **Current positioning**: At 88, we're 7 points above the 90-day mean (75.8) but below the recent peak (95-96). This suggests the story has momentum but hasn't exhausted interest.

4. **Media cycle**: Congressional pressure letter (Feb 16) ensures continued coverage through the week.

**Probability Adjustments:**
- **Increase probability**: Should be elevated above base 41% due to recency of major disruption and spring break timing. Estimate: 55-60%
- **No change probability**: Should be reduced from base 29% as volatility is expected. Estimate: 20-25%
- **Decrease probability**: Should be reduced from base 30% given the fresh news and seasonal factors. Estimate: 20-25%

**Final Calibration Considerations:**
- The threshold is >3 points change, which is relatively modest
- Recent volatility shows 8-point swings are common (95→87 in one day)
- The combination of library closures + spring break + congressional action creates multiple search triggers
- Weekend dampening (Feb 22-23) may limit upside but shouldn't cause significant decrease

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 58%
Doesn't change: 22%
Decreases: 20%
