Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (High Quality, Recent):**

1. **Google Trends baseline data (Feb 16, 2026)** - Direct measurement showing current value of 93 (vs 30-day baseline). Factual, primary source, highly relevant.

2. **Going Places article (Jan 14, 2026)** - Travel blog discussing passport policy changes, 50% of Americans lacking passports, Trump administration identity verification mandates. Mix of facts (statistics) and practical advice. Moderately reliable for context.

3. **Montfort Northeast (date unclear, refers to Feb 13, 2026 implementation)** - Reports State Department policy removing nonprofit libraries from passport processing. Cites 7,500 facilities, <1% affected per State Dept vs 15% per ALA. Factual reporting with named sources.

4. **ABC News (recent to Feb 16, 2026)** - Reports full launch of online passport renewal, expecting 5 million users annually. Official State Department announcement with named official (Rena Bitter). High credibility, factual.

5. **The Points Guy (Feb 14, 2026)** - Reports partial government shutdown beginning Feb 15, 2026. 95% of TSA staff essential but unpaid. References previous fall 2025 shutdown causing 25% TSA attrition spike. Named source (Ha Nguyen Mc Neill, TSA Acting Administrator). Factual, credible.

6. **VisaHQ (Feb 2, 2026)** - Confirms passport/visa services continue during shutdown via fee-based accounts. 400,000 passports monthly. Factual reporting.

7. **Alaska Airlines (Jan 15, 2026)** - Announces TSA Confirm ID program launching Feb 1, 2026 ($45 fee for non-REAL ID travelers). Factual, corporate communication.

**AskNews Articles (Mixed Quality, Recent):**

8. **UK passport rule changes (Feb 17-18, 2026)** - Multiple articles about Feb 25, 2026 UK dual-national passport requirements. Relevant for international context but **not directly relevant to US Google Trends**.

9. **Argentina/Poland/Ecuador/India passport changes** - Various countries implementing passport reforms. Context only; **minimal relevance to US search interest**.

10. **Nigerian eVisa announcement (Feb 17-18, 2026)** - UK implementing eVisas for Nigerian nationals. **Not relevant to US searches**.

**Key Factual Information:**
- Government shutdown began Feb 15, 2026 (2 days before question opens)
- Online passport renewal fully launched recently
- Library passport facilities shut down Feb 13, 2026
- TSA Confirm ID launched Feb 1, 2026
- REAL ID enforcement ongoing since May 2025

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Government shutdown (Feb 15, 2026)**: Multiple independent sources (Points Guy, VisaHQ) confirm shutdown affecting DHS/TSA. Previous fall 2025 shutdown caused measurable disruption and 25% TSA attrition spike. However, passport services explicitly confirmed to continue via fee-based funding. *Direction: Neutral to slight increase* (people checking if services affected).

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Online passport renewal launch**: Official State Department announcement expecting 5 million annual users. Launch timing (recent to Feb 16) could drive search interest as people learn about new option. *Direction: Increase*.

- **Library facility shutdown (Feb 13, 2026)**: Affects 1,400 libraries per ALA (15% of public libraries). Recent implementation could drive searches from affected communities seeking alternatives. *Direction: Increase*.

- **Seasonal pattern**: Late February typically shows mild upward drift as spring break/summer travel planning begins. Already embedded in 90-day base rate but reinforces upward bias. *Direction: Increase*.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **TSA Confirm ID program**: Launched Feb 1, already 2+ weeks old by question window. Initial search spike likely past. *Direction: Neutral*.

- **International passport changes**: UK, Argentina, etc. changes are not directly relevant to US Google Trends searches. *Direction: Neutral*.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 8 days (Feb 18-26, 2026)

The question opens TODAY (Feb 18) and resolves in 8 days (Feb 26). This is a very short timeframe.

**If halved (4 days)**: Would expect higher probability of "Doesn't change" due to insufficient time for news to propagate and drive behavioral change. Short-term volatility would dominate.

**If doubled (16 days)**: Would expect higher probability of "Increases" as seasonal spring-break planning momentum builds and recent policy changes (online renewal, library shutdown) have more time to drive sustained search interest.

**Key temporal factors:**
- Government shutdown is VERY recent (3 days old at question open)
- Online renewal launch is VERY recent (days to ~1 week old)
- Library shutdown is VERY recent (5 days old at question open)
- These are all within the "news cycle" window where search interest typically peaks 3-7 days after announcement

## (d) Justification

**Base rate from outside view:**
- Increases: 42%
- Doesn't change: 28%
- Decreases: 30%

**Factors warranting adjustment:**

1. **Confluence of recent events**: Three significant passport-related news items (shutdown, online renewal, library closures) all occurred within 5 days of question opening. This is unusual density of passport-related news.

2. **Shutdown timing**: While passport services continue, the shutdown creates uncertainty. Historical precedent (fall 2025) showed people search to verify service availability. The Feb 15 shutdown is 3 days old at question open—right in the window where search interest typically peaks.

3. **Current baseline is elevated**: The Feb 16 value of 93 (vs 30-day baseline of 100) indicates already-high interest, likely driven by these recent events. This suggests momentum may continue into the 8-day window.

4. **Seasonal reinforcement**: Late February typically trends upward for travel planning, which aligns with recent policy news creating additional search drivers.

**Counter-factors:**

1. **Mean reversion**: A value of 93 is near the peak. Google Trends often shows mean reversion after spikes.

2. **News cycle decay**: If the initial search spike from these events occurred Feb 13-16, the 8-day window (Feb 18-26) may capture the tail/decay rather than the peak.

3. **Weekend effect**: Feb 22-23 (Sat-Sun) typically show lower search volume, which could dampen overall movement.

**Structural assessment**: The current circumstances are somewhat more newsworthy than the typical 90-day reference class, but not dramatically so. The 90-day period already includes various policy announcements and seasonal fluctuations. The confluence of three events is notable but not unprecedented.

**Shift justification**: The recent news density and elevated baseline (93) suggest a modest upward shift from base rates. However, the risk of mean reversion from an already-elevated level is real. I estimate:
- Slight increase in "Increases" probability (+6-8 points)
- Slight decrease in "Doesn't change" (-3-4 points)
- Slight decrease in "Decreases" (-3-4 points)

## Probability Calibration

**Status quo outcome**: The current value (93) is elevated. If nothing changes, we'd expect slight mean reversion (decrease) OR continuation of upward momentum from recent news. The 8-day window is short enough that status quo (staying near 93) is plausible.

**Inside view adjustment:**

Starting from base rates (42/28/30):

1. **Recent news confluence** (+5 to Increases): Three major passport stories in 5 days is above-average news density.

2. **Elevated baseline concern** (-2 to Increases, +2 to Decreases): Value of 93 suggests some mean reversion risk.

3. **Timing within news cycle** (+3 to Increases): Shutdown is 3 days old, peak search interest typically 3-7 days post-event, so Feb 18-26 window captures likely peak period.

4. **Seasonal reinforcement** (+2 to Increases): Late February upward drift.

**Net adjustment**: +8 to Increases, -2 to Doesn't change, -6 to Decreases

**Final calibration:**
- Increases: 42 + 8 = 50%
- Doesn't change: 28 - 2 = 26%
- Decreases: 30 - 6 = 24%

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will "passport" Google Trends value on Feb 26 be >3 higher (Increases), within ±3 (Doesn't change), or >3 lower (Decreases) than Feb 18 value?

2. **Base rate**: Outside view: 42/28/30. My final: 50/26/24. Shift is moderate (+8/-2/-6), justified by unusual confluence of recent passport news within 5 days of question opening.

3. **Consistency**: Most likely = Increases (50%); Least likely = Decreases (24%). Makes sense given recent news density and timing within typical news-cycle search peak window.

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - Government shutdown Feb 15 (3 days old) historically drives verification searches
   - Online renewal launch (days old) creates new search driver
   - Library shutdown Feb 13 affects 1,400 facilities, driving alternative searches
   - Current baseline 93 shows elevated interest with momentum
   - Seasonal late-February upward trend for travel planning

5. **Blind spot**: If the Feb 13-16 period already captured the full search spike from these events, the Feb 18-26 window may show mean reversion/decay, making "Decreases" more likely than I predict. This would shift ~10 points from Increases to Decreases.

6. **Status quo**: Current value 93 is elevated. Short 8-day window and weekend effect (Feb 22-23) suggest modest movements more likely than dramatic shifts. My 26% for "Doesn't change" may be slightly low; could justify 28-30%.

7. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs.
