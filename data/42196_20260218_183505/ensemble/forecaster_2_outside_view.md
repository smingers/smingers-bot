Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Condé Nast Traveler (Feb 27, 2024)**: High-quality travel publication discussing spring break 2024 trends. Shows historical pattern of increased international travel during spring break season, which would drive passport interest. However, this is 2 years old and provides limited direct relevance to Feb 2026 timeframe.

**The Passport Office Blog (Jan 30, 2026)**: Recent and directly relevant. Factual information about passport requirements and processing challenges during spring break season. This is a commercial passport service provider, so has promotional bias, but the timing advice and seasonal patterns are credible.

**The Traveler (Feb 9, 2026)**: Very recent article noting St. Thomas (no passport required for US citizens) is trending for spring break 2026. This could actually suppress passport search interest if travelers choose passport-free destinations. Factual data on airline search trends.

**MLive (Feb 16, 2026)**: Highly relevant and recent. Reports State Department ordered ~1,400 nonprofit libraries to stop processing passport applications effective Feb 13, 2026. This is factual reporting with specific quotes from officials and lawmakers. The timing is critical - this just happened 5 days ago and could drive searches as people look for alternative locations.

**VisaHQ (Feb 2, 2026)**: Reports on government shutdown but confirms passport services continue. Less relevant to our timeframe since the shutdown context has passed.

**Times Now News (Feb 16, 2026)**: Duplicates the library closure story from MLive. Confirms bipartisan congressional response and provides additional context about the 1,400 affected libraries.

**Agent Report**: Comprehensive summary identifying two major drivers:
1. TSA's $45 "Confirm ID" fee for flying without Real ID (effective Feb 1, 2026)
2. Library passport service shutdown (effective Feb 13, 2026)

The agent correctly identifies these as recent policy changes that could drive search interest. The analysis of timing and search behavior patterns appears sound.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**
1. **8-day windows in passport Google Trends data (last 90 days)**: Most directly applicable - shows 29% no change, 41% increase, 30% decrease
2. **Spring break preparation period (late Jan - early March)**: Historically shows elevated passport interest
3. **Post-policy announcement periods**: New government policies affecting travel documents typically drive search spikes
4. **Weekend vs. weekday patterns**: The forecast period spans Feb 18-26 (Tuesday to Wednesday), including one weekend

**Most suitable reference class**: The 8-day window analysis from the Google Trends data, adjusted for:
- Current elevated baseline (88 vs 90-day mean of 75.8)
- Recent upward momentum (last 7 days avg 87.1 vs prior 79.7)
- Two significant policy changes in the past 2 weeks

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 8 days (Feb 18-26, 2026)

**Current context (Feb 18, 2026)**:
- Starting value: 88 (already elevated, 0.85 standard deviations above 90-day mean)
- Recent trajectory: Strong upward trend (Feb 16: 95, Feb 17: 96, Feb 18: 88)
- The value dropped from 96 to 88 today, suggesting potential volatility

**Historical 8-day patterns**:
- 41% probability of increase >3 points
- 29% probability of staying within ±3 points
- 30% probability of decrease >3 points

**Key timing factors**:
1. Library closure (Feb 13) is only 5 days old - media coverage and public awareness still building
2. TSA Confirm ID fee (Feb 1) is 17 days old - awareness spreading through social media
3. Spring break season approaching (typically March-April) - planning window
4. President's Day weekend just passed (Feb 17) - travel planning activity
5. The forecast period includes Feb 22-23 (weekend) when leisure travel planning peaks

## (d) Justification

The outside view suggests a **higher than baseline probability of increase** for several reasons:

1. **Recent policy shocks**: Two significant government policy changes (library closures and TSA fee) occurred within the past 17 days. These typically drive sustained search interest as news spreads through secondary channels (local media, social media, word-of-mouth).

2. **Current elevated baseline**: Starting at 88 (vs 90-day mean of 75.8) indicates already heightened interest, but recent volatility (96→88 in one day) suggests the trend hasn't stabilized.

3. **Seasonal context**: Late February is prime spring break planning time. The historical context shows international travel bookings surge during this period, driving passport-related searches.

4. **Information diffusion lag**: Major policy changes take 1-2 weeks to reach mainstream awareness. The library closure story (Feb 13) is exactly in that window where broader public discovery occurs.

5. **Weekend effect**: The forecast period includes Feb 22-23 weekend, when leisure travelers typically research and plan trips.

However, **countervailing factors** suggest caution:

1. **High starting point**: At 88, there's less room to grow before hitting the 100 ceiling
2. **Recent volatility**: The 96→88 drop suggests instability
3. **Mean reversion tendency**: Values significantly above mean tend to regress
4. **St. Thomas trend**: Some travelers may choose passport-free destinations

The base rate shows 41% increase probability, but given the confluence of recent policy changes, seasonal timing, and information diffusion patterns, I assess the true probability of increase as somewhat higher than the base rate.

## Outside view calibration:

The base rate (41% increase, 29% no change, 30% decrease) provides a starting anchor, but several factors warrant adjustment:

**Upward adjustments to "Increases":**
- Two policy shocks within 17 days (library closure + TSA fee)
- Optimal timing for information diffusion (5-17 days post-announcement)
- Spring break planning season
- Weekend included in forecast period
- Recent upward momentum (despite today's drop)

**Downward adjustments to "Increases":**
- Already elevated baseline (88) limits upside
- Recent 8-point drop (96→88) shows volatility
- Mean reversion pressure from elevated levels

**Calibration reasoning:**
Historical upset rate in Google Trends predictions is moderate - trends can shift quickly based on news cycles. The combination of two recent policy changes affecting passport access/requirements during peak planning season is unusual and not fully captured in the 90-day base rate.

I estimate:
- **Increases**: 50% (vs 41% base rate) - elevated due to policy timing and seasonal factors
- **Doesn't change**: 25% (vs 29% base rate) - reduced due to volatility and policy shocks
- **Decreases**: 25% (vs 30% base rate) - reduced due to sustained policy-driven interest

This represents moderate confidence in an increase while acknowledging significant uncertainty from the high starting point and recent volatility.

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 50
Doesn't change: 25
Decreases: 25
