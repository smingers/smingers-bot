Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase, <30 words)  
Between 2026-02-18 and 2026-02-26 (US, topic “passport”, fixed range 2026-01-27–2026-02-26), compare daily values: +>3 = Increases; within ±3 = Doesn’t change; <-3 = Decreases.

2) Outside view base rates (given)  
Increases 50 / Doesn’t change 25 / Decreases 25.

(a) Source analysis (what each says; quality/date; fact vs opinion)

- GoingPlacesFarAndNear (Jan 14, 2026): Travel-advice article on passports/visas, processing delays, and policy shifts. Mostly practical guidance; some speculative framing about retaliation. Medium quality; not a primary source.

- MontfortNortheast / library acceptance facilities story (policy effective Feb 13, 2026): Reports State Department enforcement causing some libraries to stop passport acceptance. Contains concrete numbers and timeline; likely based on official/regulatory facts. Medium-high relevance; could drive “where to apply” searches.

- ABC News (around Feb 16, 2026): Reports State Dept says online passport renewal now fully available. High-quality mainstream source; includes attributable official (Rena Bitter). Strongly relevant; clear causal pathway to searches.

- The Points Guy (Feb 14, 2026): Travel impacts of partial shutdown; mostly operational info. Credible travel outlet; more indirect linkage to “passport” searches.

- VisaHQ (Feb 2, 2026): Says passport/visa services continue during shutdown due to fee funding, with some indirect risks. Secondary source; could be accurate but less authoritative than State Dept. Indirect relevance.

- Alaska Airlines (Jan 15, 2026): Announces TSA “Confirm ID” option/fee for those lacking REAL ID; notes passports are acceptable ID. Primary-ish corporate communication; relevant but indirect (might increase passport-as-ID searches).

AskNews items (Feb 17–18, 2026): many are UK/Argentina/Poland/India-focused. For US Google Trends, relevance varies:
- UK dual-national rule effective Feb 25 (Birmingham Mail, Daily Record; Travel And Tour World): Could create US searches among US-based dual nationals and travelers. Sources are mixed: local tabloids/aggregators vs travel site; facts likely based on UK Home Office policy, but US impact uncertain.
- Argentina/India/Poland passport changes: Mostly irrelevant to US search volume except among diaspora; weak for US national Trends.
- “Confirmed | U.S. to Ban Passport Renewal…” (El Cronista, Spanish): Could drive searches if it circulates widely, but this looks like potentially misleading/click-driven framing; treat cautiously (lower weight unless corroborated by primary US sources).

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence
- ABC News / State Dept announcement that online renewal is fully available (Feb 16): direct, nationwide, and highly “searchable” (eligibility, how-to, troubleshooting). Likely to sustain elevated interest for days, though the *announcement spike* often decays.

Moderate evidence
- Library acceptance facility enforcement effective Feb 13: plausible sustained searches for locations/alternatives; but may be regionally concentrated and partially “already absorbed” by Feb 18.
- REAL ID/TSA “Confirm ID” and passports as alternative ID: ongoing structural driver that keeps “passport” salient, but not necessarily causing a discrete Feb 26 jump vs Feb 18.
- UK rule change effective Feb 25: timing aligns closely with Feb 26 and could nudge upward, but US-wide magnitude uncertain.

Weak evidence
- Shutdown-related articles: could add background anxiety, but multiple reports say passport operations continue; likely small incremental effect on “passport” searches.
- Non-US passport policy changes (Argentina/India/Poland/Ecuador/Russia): small diaspora effect; unlikely to move US national Trends much.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Window is 8 days (Feb 18 → Feb 26). This is short; single-day comparisons are noisy.  
- If halved (4 days): I’d lean more toward “Doesn’t change,” because less time for drift and fewer news-cycle phases.  
- If doubled (16 days): I’d lean more toward a directional move (often mean reversion after an announcement spike *or* seasonal spring-travel climb), reducing “Doesn’t change.”

(d) Justification (how inside-view shifts the outside-view)
Status quo on Feb 18 appears already elevated (recently reported near ~high-80s/90s in the outside-view notes). The key question is whether Feb 26 ends up >3 higher, within ±3, or >3 lower than Feb 18 *within the fixed 1/27–2/26 scale*.

Forces pushing toward Increases by Feb 26:
- UK rule effective Feb 25 is very close to the endpoint and could create a small late-window bump.
- Ongoing friction/attention: online renewal availability + library acceptance disruptions keep “passport” in the news and in people’s planning.

Forces pushing toward Decreases by Feb 26:
- The biggest discrete “news shock” (online renewal fully available) likely peaked around Feb 16–17; by Feb 18 we may already be on the downslope. Announcement-driven search spikes commonly decay over ~1–2 weeks.
- Elevated starting point increases mean-reversion pressure; a drift down of >3 over 8 days is plausible.

Net: compared to the outside view (50/25/25), I reduce “Increases” somewhat because the major attention catalyst likely occurred just before the start date, raising the chance that Feb 18 is already “high,” making further net gains harder. I increase “Decreases” modestly for mean reversion, while keeping “Doesn’t change” roughly similar (short windows remain noisy and could land within ±3).

Probability calibration

- Increases: 46  
- Doesn’t change: 25  
- Decreases: 29  

Checklist (brief)

1. Criteria/options check: Compare Feb 26 vs Feb 18 values on fixed 1/27–2/26 US Trends; >3 up/down thresholds; otherwise within 3 = no change.  
2. Outside view anchor used: 50 / 25 / 25.  
3. Consistency check: Most likely = Increases; Least likely = Doesn’t change (slightly), consistent with short-window volatility and competing up/down forces.  
4. Key evidence (3–5 items, <20 words each):  
   - Feb 16 online renewal “fully available” announcement (State Dept via ABC).  
   - Feb 13 library passport acceptance disruption drives “where/how” searches.  
   - Feb 25 UK dual-national passport rule could create late-window bump.  
   - Elevated starting level implies mean reversion risk over 8 days.  
5. Blind spot: A viral US story (or outage/problem) about online renewal could spike Feb 26 sharply upward.  
6. Status quo outcome: With high baseline, “no change” remains meaningful; kept at 25.  
7. Technicalities: Probabilities sum to 100; each 0–100; ordered as requested.

Probabilities: [46, 25, 29]
