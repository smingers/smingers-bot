Analysis
(a) Source analysis (quality, factual content, recency – abridged)

1. ABC News (16 Feb 2026): State Department makes online passport renewal permanently available; quotes Assistant Secretary Rena Bitter. – High-quality, factual, <3 days old.  
2. Montfort Northeast (14 Feb 2026): State Department orders nonprofit libraries to stop accepting passport applications (policy fully in force 13 Feb). – Local reporting, factual, 4 days old.  
3. VisaHQ (2 Feb 2026): Consular Affairs says passports continue during shutdown. – Commercial but data-based, 2 weeks old.  
4. The Points Guy (14 Feb 2026): Partial federal shutdown; TSA staffing risks. – Reputable specialist outlet, factual, 4 days old.  
5. Multiple UK-press pieces (Daily Record, Birmingham Mail, Travel & Tour World 17-18 Feb 2026): New 25 Feb British-passport rule for dual citizens; widely repeated, clearly sourced to Home Office. – Reliable on policy fact; fresh.  
6. Argentina / India / Poland passport-reform items (18 Feb and earlier) – Factual but outside US scope for GEO=US.  
7. Google Trends 30-day series (Jan 17–Feb 16): 8-day change base rates: 41 % ↑, 29 % =, 30 % ↓; current index 93 (high).

(b) Evidence weighting relative to US Google searches the next eight days

Strong evidence  
• Historical 90-day 8-day-window base rates supplied by Trends (matches scoring rule).  
• Seasonality: late-Feb run-up to spring-break travel is a durable, repeated driver of passport activity in prior years.  
• Prominent, nation-wide rollout of online renewal (ABC News) – a structural change likely to trigger “how to renew passport” searches.

Moderate evidence  
• Sudden removal of ~1 400 library acceptance sites (publicised 14-16 Feb) pushes applicants online, prompting queries such as “where to get passport”.  
• Looming 25 Feb UK rule for dual nationals – niche but heavily covered; may create spike 22-25 Feb (“need UK passport”).  
• Partial federal shutdown headlines may fuel uncertainty (“are passports being issued?”) and hence searches.

Weak evidence  
• Foreign (Argentina/India/Poland) reforms – minimal impact on US search traffic.  
• TSA Confirm ID fee (launched 1 Feb) – covered earlier; incremental effect likely already baked into 93 baseline.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution window: 8 days (18 → 26 Feb 2026).  Halving (4 days) would raise the chance of “Doesn’t change”; doubling (16 days) would increase probability of a ≥3-point move because the index is volatile.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
Status quo: 93 is elevated but not necessarily the series peak (100).  The coincidence of three fresh, US-relevant passport stories (online renewal launch, loss of library acceptance sites, shutdown anxiety) plus the widely-reported 25 Feb UK deadline should prop up or lift search interest through at least the 24-25 Feb news cycle.  Mean-reversion pressure exists, yet the upcoming UK rule happens late in the window, giving room for a mid-period uptick.  On balance, I shift 4 percentage points from Decrease and 1 pt from No-change to Increase relative to the outside-view 38/29/33.

Inside-view probabilities
Increases………42 %  
Doesn’t change…28 %  
Decreases………30 %

Checklist
1. Options: comparison of 26 Feb vs 18 Feb Google-Trends value; >+3 → Increase, |Δ|≤3 → No-change, <–3 → Decrease – 8-day window.  
2. Outside-view: 38 / 29 / 33.  
3. Consistency: Most-likely = Increase (42 %); Least-likely = No-change (28 %).  Fits argument.  
4. Key evidence (20 wds max each)  
   • National rollout of online renewal announced 16 Feb.  
   • Library acceptance shutdown drives applicants to web searches.  
   • UK 25 Feb passport rule dominates travel press next week.  
   • 90-day base rate: 71 % probability of >3-point move.  
5. Blind-spot: Big spike already occurred pre-18 Feb; interest drifts down despite news, producing >3-point drop.  
6. Status-quo pull: Short horizon, volatility high; retain 28 % for “No-change”.  
7. Numbers sum 100; each between 0-100.

Probabilities: [42, 28, 30]
