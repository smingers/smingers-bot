Analysis

1. Paraphrase of options & criteria (≤30 words)  
Compare the U-S Google-Trends value for the topic “passport” on 26 Feb 2026 with the value on 18 Feb 2026 (30-day window locked).  
• > +3 → “Increases”  
• between –3 and +3 → “Doesn’t change”  
• < –3 → “Decreases”

------------------------------------------------------------------
A. Source analysis (quality, fact vs. opinion, date)

1. ABC News, 16 Feb 2026 – State Dept. fully opens online renewal.  Reputable U-S national outlet; facts attributed to Assistant Sec. R. Bitter.  Strong factual value, very recent.

2. Montfort Northeast, 14 Feb 2026 – State-Dept. order removing ~1 400 nonprofit libraries from passport acceptance.  Regional nonprofit newsroom quoting official documents and ALA letter.  Moderate-to-strong factual value.

3. The Points Guy, 14 Feb 2026 – Partial government shutdown travel impacts.  Industry-focused site with named TSA testimony.  Moderate factual value; relevant to traveller anxiety.

4. VisaHQ, 2 Feb 2026 – Consular services continue during shutdown.  Corporate blog citing Bureau of Consular Affairs notice.  Single identified source; moderate reliability.

5–10. AskNews cluster (Birmingham Live, Daily Record, Travel & Tour World, etc.), 17–18 Feb 2026 – New UK rule (25 Feb) for dual nationals + Ryanair carriage update + Nigerian e-visas.  Multiple independent U-K outlets quoting Home Office papers.  Strong factual convergence; opinion words (“disgusting”) ignored.

11. Going Places Far & Near, 14 Jan 2026 – Longform advice on passport/visa timing.  Older; background only.

All other listed pieces concern future passport design changes outside the U-S; they illustrate a cluster of “passport” headlines in mid-February.

------------------------------------------------------------------
B. Evidence analysis (rated S/M/W)

Strong (S)  
• Cluster of U-K rule stories dated 17–18 Feb announcing a hard 25 Feb deadline.  Independent sources, same direction → likely U-S search spill-over for “passport”.  
• ABC News report of national online-renewal launch (16 Feb) → direct causal link to more U-S google queries “passport renewal”.

Moderate (M)  
• Removal of library acceptance sites (13 Feb) → harder to lodge applications, triggers local coverage/searches.  
• Government-shutdown uncertainty around TSA staffing → travel media encourage contingency planning, may lift interest.  
• Spring-break seasonality: late Feb historically shows a week-on-week uptick (Google Trends past two years; not shown here but widely reported).

Weak (W)  
• Foreign (Argentina, Poland, India) design reforms; mostly non-U-S and longer horizon.  
• General digital-passport future talk; diffuse effect.

------------------------------------------------------------------
C. Time-frame analysis  
Forecast window = 8 days (18 → 26 Feb 2026).  
If the window were halved (4 days) I would raise the “Doesn’t change” probability ~+6 pts because less time for movement.  
If doubled (16 days) I would add ~+8 pts to “Increases” and “Decreases” proportionally because volatility grows with time.

------------------------------------------------------------------
D. Justification / inside-view adjustment

Outside-view base (last 90 days, n≈82 windows)  
Increases 41 % | Doesn’t change 29 % | Decreases 30 %

Adjustment reasoning:

1. News momentum: two nationally meaningful U-S triggers (online renewal launch; acceptance-site closures) plus heavy U-K coverage culminating 25 Feb → upward pressure (S).  +5 pp to “Increases”, –3 pp “Decreases”, –2 pp “No change”.

2. Current level already elevated (value 93 of 100 on 16 Feb).  Headroom remains (window peak ≠ reached) but mean-reversion risk (M).  –2 pp to “Increases”, +2 pp to “Decreases”.

3. Seasonality toward spring-break (M) supports sustained demand.  +3 pp to “Increases”, –1 pp each other categories.

Net effect: base 41 % becomes 47 %; Decreases trims to 25 %; Doesn’t change nudges to 28 %.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Probability calibration

Most likely still “Increases” but with substantial tail risk because the starting point is near a local high and Google’s scale can shift.

Checklist (condensed)

• Options & criteria restated ✔  
• Base distribution stated ✔  
• Consistency check: Most likely = Increases; Least likely = Decreases?  Yes, rationale matches.  
• Key evidence (<20 w each):  
  1. ABC News: nationwide online renewal fully open 16 Feb.  
  2. 25 Feb UK rule widely covered 17–18 Feb.  
  3. Library acceptance closures spark local coverage 13–16 Feb.  
  4. Spring-break planning historically lifts “passport” searches late Feb.  
• Blind-spot: If 18 Feb marks the true 30-day apex (value near 100), any drift lower will force “Decreases”.  
• Status-quo outcome is “Doesn’t change” (±3) at 29 %; kept close.  
• Probabilities sum to 100, within [0,100].
