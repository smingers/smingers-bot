Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Condé Nast Traveler (Feb-27 2024): magazine feature on Spring-Break 2024 travel demand. Factual statistics come from AAA and Priceline; opinions from travel experts. Dated and only indirectly relevant to 2026 search behaviour.  
2. The Passport Office blog (Jan-30 2026): commercial post reminding readers to renew passports early. Low journalistic rigor but timely; facts about validity rules are accurate.  
3. The Traveler (Feb-09 2026): reports airline search data showing St. Thomas popularity. Original data set cited (Spirit Airlines); otherwise routine travel journalism.  
4. MLive (Feb-16 2026) & 5. TimesNowNews (Feb-16 2026): parallel news stories on the State-Department order ending passport acceptance at many non-profit libraries. Both are mainstream news outlets quoting official statements and a congressional letter; high factual value.  
6. VisaHQ (Feb-02 2026): corporate blog explaining that passport issuance continues during the shutdown. Factual but partly promotional; cites State-Department notice.  
7. Agent report (compiled Feb-18 2026): synthesises primary government notices and major media coverage from Jan–Feb 2026. Useful chronology; factual details traceable to named sources.  
8. Google Trends data set supplied with the question: hard data (daily U-S search‐interest values for “passport”) and summary base-rate frequencies for all rolling 8-day windows in the past 90 days. This is the principal quantitative input for an outside view.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate reference classes:  
• All 8-day windows for “passport” over the past 90 days (n≈82).  
• All 8-day windows for “passport” during the same late-Feb period in 2024 and 2025 (not provided).  
• All 8-day windows for comparable travel-document terms (e.g., “Real ID”) (data not provided).  

The first class is the only one with complete, verified numbers, so I adopt it.  In that class, an 8-day change of > ±3 points occurred 71 % of the time; increases out-numbered decreases 41 % to 30 %.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Prediction window: 8 days (18 Feb → 26 Feb 2026).  
Historic pattern for “passport” over the last 90 days:  
• Mean 75.8, σ 14.3.  
• Current value on 18 Feb is 88 (≈0.85 σ above the mean).  
• Recent seven-day average (87.1) exceeds the prior seven-day average (79.7), implying a short-run up-trend—but that information belongs more to an inside view and is excluded from the pure base-rate estimate.  

(d) Justification (outside view)  
Using the chosen reference class:

– Probability of “Doesn’t change” (|Δ| ≤ 3): 29 %.  
– Conditional on change, odds of up vs. down are 41 : 30.  
Multiplying out and normalising gives:  

Increases ≈ 41 / (41+30) × 71 % ≈ 41 %  
Decreases ≈ 30 / (41+30) × 71 % ≈ 30 %  
Doesn’t change ≈ 29 %

The news items about library closures, TSA’s $45 Confirm-ID fee, and spring-break planning may well push searches upward, but those are inside-view considerations and are deliberately withheld at this stage.

Outside view calibration:

• Historical hit rates for this domain (Google-Trends one-week movements) show ≈30 % “no-change” and a roughly even split of the remaining 70 % between up and down.  
• Upsets are common; absolute movements > 3 points happen 7 times in 10.  
• Therefore I keep probabilities close to the measured frequencies and round to whole numbers.  I add no subjective tilt because the objective base-rate already captures a mixture of rising and falling weeks.

Outside View Prediction:
['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']  
Increases: 41%  
Doesn't change: 29%  
Decreases: 30%
