You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “passport” change between 2026-02-18 and 2026-02-26 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “passport” at the time of writing this question (Feb 16, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 93; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=passport&date=2026-01-17%202026-02-16).

`{"format":"trends_interest_change_magnitude","info":{"topic":"passport","trend_start":"2026-02-18","trend_end":"2026-02-26","verification_url":"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=passport&date=2026-01-27%202026-02-26"}}`

The options are: ['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves “Doesn't change” if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=passport&date=2026-01-27%202026-02-26](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=passport&date=2026-01-27%202026-02-26) for 2026-02-26 is within 3 of the value at 2026-02-18. It resolves “Increases” if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves “Decreases” if the value is more than 3 lower.

# Summary of Article: "St. Thomas Emerges as Spring Break 2026 Hotspot in Spirit Search Trends"

**Source:** The Traveler  
**Date:** February 09, 2026

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Search Trends Data:** Spirit Airlines released search data showing St. Thomas (U.S. Virgin Islands) is now among the top searched spring break destinations alongside Fort Lauderdale, San Juan, Miami, Cancun, and Aruba for 2026.

2. **Historical Context:** In early 2025, Spirit's search data for spring 2025 showed Orlando, Fort Lauderdale, Miami, and San Juan among the top five most searched markets.

3. **Airline Service:**
   - Spirit Airlines has served St. Thomas for 20 years and recently celebrated this milestone with a fare promotion for early 2026 travel
   - Southwest Airlines is preparing to launch new service to St. Thomas in early 2026, marking its first time serving the U.S. Virgin Islands
   - Southwest's Caribbean network already includes Aruba, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico

4. **Passport Requirement:** U.S. citizens do not need a passport to enter the U.S. Virgin Islands (relevant to the forecasting question about passport search interest).

5. **Airport:** St. Thomas is served by Cyril E. King International Airport.

## Key Context:

- Spirit Airlines is undergoing comprehensive restructuring and redeploying capacity toward high-demand leisure routes, particularly warm-weather beach corridors popular in March and early April
- The increased airline competition (Spirit and Southwest) is expected to help keep fares competitive during spring break 2026
- St. Thomas is positioned as offering a balance between Florida's urban beaches and more remote Caribbean islands in terms of experience and accessibility

## Relevant Opinions:

The article suggests (source: The Traveler's analysis) that St. Thomas is "evolving from a niche Caribbean alternative into a mainstream contender" for spring break travel, appealing to both luxury resort guests and budget travelers.

# Summary of Article: State Department Orders Libraries Nationwide to No Longer Process Passport Applications

**Source:** mlive  
**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Author:** Matt Durr

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- The State Department ordered certain non-profit public libraries nationwide to stop processing passport applications because they no longer qualify as Passport Acceptance Facilities
- The rule officially went into effect on Friday, February 13, 2026
- Libraries began being notified of this change last fall (2025)
- Government-run libraries may continue to process passport applications
- The State Department has over 7,500 acceptance facilities nationwide
- According to the State Department spokesperson, the number of ineligible libraries makes up less than 1% of their total network

## Statistics on Affected Libraries:

- **American Library Association estimate:** About 1,400 mostly non-profit public libraries could be impacted (though it's unclear how many actually participated in the program)
- **By state (percentage of public libraries that are nonprofit):**
  - Pennsylvania: 85%
  - Maine: 56%
  - Rhode Island: 54%
  - New York: 47%
  - Connecticut: 46%

## Stated Rationale:

- A State Department spokesperson cited federal laws that "clearly prohibit non-governmental organizations" from collecting and retaining fees for passport applications
- The State Department did not answer questions about why this became an issue now after being offered for many years

## Impact Examples:

- Otis Library in Norwich, Connecticut offered the service for 18 years before stopping in November 2025
- The library's executive director (Cathleen Special) stated: "We still get calls daily seeking that service. Our community was so used to us offering this."

## Political Response:

- Bipartisan lawmakers from Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio pressuring the State Department to reconsider
- The lawmakers stated: "In a time when demand for passports is surging, libraries are among the most accessible passport acceptance facilities, particularly for working families and rural residents"
- Lawmakers also noted the move is expected to cause several libraries to cut staff and programs due to loss of processing fees

## Alternative Options:

- The State Department estimates 99% of the U.S. population lives within 20 miles of a designated passport processing location
- Alternative locations include post offices, county clerk's offices, or government-run libraries
- State Department spokesperson said they will work to identify new eligible program partners in impacted areas if needed

# Summary of Article: State Department Confirms Passports and Visas Will Continue During Shutdown

**Source:** VisaHQ

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Government shutdown began:** Midnight, January 31 [2026 implied]
- **State Department announcement:** February 2 [2026 implied], Bureau of Consular Affairs posted a "lapse in appropriations" notice
- **Services continuing:** Domestic passport agencies, overseas embassies, and U.S. consulates will remain operational during the shutdown
- **Funding source:** Fee-based accounts that do not require annual congressional appropriations
- **Monthly volume:** Approximately 400,000 U.S. passports and 240,000 visas are issued each month
- **Historical context:** Reference to 2019 when passport issuance slowed dramatically during a previous shutdown

## Key Points:

1. **Essential services protected:** Visa adjudication, emergency American-citizen assistance, and overseas absentee-voting support will continue

2. **Potential indirect impacts warned:**
   - Shortages of contract guards and local support staff (paid from lapsed appropriations) could reduce public-hour windows
   - Embassy travel by furloughed DHS officers may be curtailed
   - Prolonged impasse could disrupt premium-processing upgrades at USCIS service centers (which rely on both user fees and appropriated funds)

3. **Recommendations for travelers and employers:**
   - Build extra lead time into passport renewals and interview scheduling
   - Enroll in Smart Traveler Enrollment Program (STEP) for emergency updates
   - Monitor shutdown negotiations
   - Maintain contact with immigration counsel until full spending bill is enacted

**Note:** This article appears to be promotional content from VisaHQ, a commercial passport/visa service provider, though it contains factual information about the government shutdown and passport services.

# Summary of Article: US State Department Ends Public Library Passport Services

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **Effective Date**: Beginning February 13, 2026, certain nonprofit public libraries were ordered to stop processing passport applications
- **Scope of Impact**: The American Library Association estimates approximately 1,400 mostly nonprofit public libraries (roughly 15% of all public libraries) could potentially be affected
- **Existing Infrastructure**: The State Department notes there are more than 7,500 passport acceptance facilities nationwide, with 99% of the US population living within 20 miles of a processing location
- **Type of Libraries Affected**: Only nonprofit public libraries are impacted; government-run libraries can continue offering passport services

## Legal/Policy Rationale:

- The State Department cited that federal law and regulations "clearly prohibit non-governmental organizations" from collecting and retaining fees for passport applications

## Congressional Response:

- Bipartisan members of Congress from Connecticut, Pennsylvania, New York, New Jersey, and Maryland sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio
- Lawmakers urged the department to extend the program until Congress finds a permanent solution
- Bipartisan legislation has been proposed to amend the Passport Act of 1920 to allow 501(c)(3) nonprofit public libraries to continue as passport acceptance facilities

## Specific Example:

- **Otis Library in Norwich, Connecticut**: Offered passport services for 18 years before ending in November 2025
- Executive Director Cathleen Special reported they "still get calls daily seeking that service"
- The library previously served as an overflow option when the nearby post office was unavailable

## Concerns Raised by Lawmakers:

- Timing issue: "demand for passports is surging"
- Accessibility concerns for working families and rural residents
- Potential consequences: residents may need to travel farther, take unpaid time off work, or delay obtaining passports
- Financial impact: some libraries may need to cut staff or programs due to loss of passport processing fees
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Summarize any U.S. passport fee changes, processing-time alerts, Real ID reminders, or other official announcements from Jan–Feb 2026 that could spur a surge in Google searches over the next week.
Below is a concise roundup of U-S-government actions, effective or announced during January–February 2026, that are capable of triggering a noticeable spike in Google searches for the term “passport” (or closely related terms such as “Real ID” and “TSA fee”) in the coming week (Feb 18 – Feb 26 2026).

1. TSA begins charging $45 to fly without a Real ID or passport (goes live Feb 1, 2026)  
   • Policy: TSA’s new “Confirm ID” program allows passengers who arrive at a U-S airport without a Real ID-compliant driver’s license, passport, or other accepted ID to verify identity for a $45 user fee.  
   • Key dates: Announced in late 2025; fully in force as of 1 Feb 2026.  
   • Practical impact: Anyone 18 + who forgets or lacks compliant ID now faces a cashless online payment, extra biometric screening (10–30 min), and a verification that expires after 10 days. (NBC News, 31 Jan 2026; Los Angeles Times, 21 Jan 2026; NBC4 Washington, 1 Dec 2025).  
   • Why it will drive searches now: Many leisure travelers learn about the fee only when spring-break planning starts. Local TV segments and social media posts that mention an unexpected $45 charge or longer checkpoint times typically send people googling “passport vs Real ID,” “TSA Confirm ID,” and “do I need a passport to fly domestic.”

2. State Department shuts down passport acceptance at nonprofit public libraries (effective 13 Feb 2026)  
   • Policy: Cease-and-desist letters were sent to roughly 1,400 nonprofit public libraries, ordering them to stop collecting passport applications because federal rules bar nongovernmental entities from handling passport fees. Government-run libraries, post offices, clerks of court, and other facilities remain in the program.  
   • Immediate effects: Loss of many evening/weekend appointment slots in suburban and rural areas; libraries forfeit execution-fee revenue (up to 12 % of some budgets). Community members must re-book at post offices or travel farther. (The Economic Times, 16 Feb 2026).  
   • Search impulse: Residents who previously used a local library will now look for the “nearest passport office,” “passport appointment near me,” or “passport acceptance facility list,” especially as spring travel demand rises.

3. REAL ID compliance housekeeping notices (California DMV, 31 Dec 2025)  
   • What happened: California DMV began notifying ~325,000 REAL ID cardholders (≈1.5 % of the state’s total) that a legacy software glitch set the wrong expiration date on their cards. The DMV is re-issuing corrected credentials at no cost. (California DMV, 31 Dec 2025).  
   • Relevance: Although the mailing went out in late December, most recipients are receiving letters and emails in January–February. People surprised by the notice are expected to search “Is my REAL ID still valid?” or “REAL ID expiration correction.”

4. Ongoing passport-processing and security-screening frictions  
   a. Name-matching security holds (“administrative processing”)  
      • Investigative report highlights an uptick in applications automatically flagged because the applicant’s name resembles one on a federal watchlist, leading to renewals stretched to 6–10 months. (Vetromebel.com, 16 Feb 2026).  
      • Although not an official bulletin, the story quotes State-Department call-center language and could prompt anxious travelers to search “passport stuck in processing,” “application flagged,” or “how long is administrative review.”  
   b. Routine processing-time advisory  
      • The State Department’s processing-time page was refreshed in early February to remind applicants that demand rises from late winter into summer and that the published turnaround windows (routine vs. expedited) do not include mailing time. (Travel.State.gov, consulted Feb 2026).  
      • This standard update is less dramatic than the fee or facility closures, but in combination with the library shutdown it may amplify queries like “current passport timeframe” or “expedite passport February 2026.”

5. Clarifications on 2026 passport fee schedule  
   • No mid-cycle fee hike has been announced for 2026. Adult routine renewal remains $130; first-time adult passport book stays at $165 (application $130 + acceptance $35); expedited service surcharge remains $60. (Visafoto explainer updated 6 Jan 2026; PassportsAndVisas.com, Oct 2025).  
   • Because online articles dated January are circulating on social media, some consumers may mistakenly think a price increase is new for February. Result: quick Google checks of “passport fee February 2026” or “did passport cost go up.”

Likelihood of a search-interest spike
• The TSA $45 Confirm ID fee is the only truly “new” national policy to take effect this month, and it affects every U-S flyer who lacks compliant ID. A price tag attached to a security checkpoint is highly discoverable and shareable—conditions that usually produce search surges.  
• The State-Department library shutdown removes a familiar local service, turning many routine in-person applicants into last-minute online searchers.  
• Both items landed within the past seven days (library letters dated 13 Feb; first major travel-media coverage of Confirm ID fee on 31 Jan and continuing), aligning perfectly with the Feb 18 – Feb 26 forecast window.

Key takeaways for forecasters
• Monitor media coverage and social chatter around “$45 airport ID fee” and “passport library service ended.” These two stories are primed to reach mainstream audiences between President’s Day weekend and the start of spring-break bookings, likely lifting Google Trends interest in “passport.”  
• No official passport fee increase or processing-time shock was issued in January–February 2026, so fee and delay inquiries will probably be secondary ripples caused by the facility shutdown and Real ID discourse.  
• Real ID enforcement itself is already in effect (since May 7 2025), but the newly monetized workaround (Confirm ID) reframes the topic from compliance to cost, a shift that tends to draw broader consumer attention.

In summary, among all official announcements from January–February 2026, the TSA’s $45 Confirm ID program and the State Department’s termination of passport services at nonprofit libraries are the two developments most likely to drive a noticeable week-ahead uptick in U-S Google searches related to “passport,” “Real ID,” and similar terms.</Agent_report>
