Disagreement Analysis:

**Disagreement 1: Whether the Feb 18 starting value is already past the peak or still rising**
- Forecaster 1 believes the value has already dropped from 93 to ~88 by Feb 18, establishing clear downward momentum. This leads them to assign 50% to Decreases and only 15% to Increases.
- Forecasters 2, 3, 4, and 5 believe the value is still elevated/rising or at least stable near 93, assigning 42-50% to Increases.
- This is the single largest source of disagreement, creating a ~35 percentage point spread on "Increases" (15% vs 50%) and "Decreases" (50% vs 24-25%).
- The critical factual question: What is the actual Google Trends value for "passport" on Feb 18, 2026?

**Disagreement 2: Whether news catalysts (online renewal launch, library closures, UK passport rule) will sustain or boost interest through Feb 26, or whether they've already peaked**
- Forecasters 2, 4, and 5 emphasize that the UK Feb 25 passport rule deadline and ongoing online renewal coverage will create fresh search interest late in the window, supporting Increases.
- Forecasters 1 and 3 argue the major news shocks occurred before Feb 18 and are already decaying, with mean reversion being the dominant force.
- This affects the spread by ~10-15 percentage points between the camps.

**Disagreement 3: Strength of mean reversion from elevated baseline**
- Forecaster 1 heavily weights mean reversion (citing 88 vs 75.8 average), making Decreases most likely.
- Forecasters 4 and 5 acknowledge mean reversion but argue it's offset by active news catalysts and seasonal factors.
- This is partly a weighting difference but also depends on whether the current level truly is anomalously high.

Root Causes:

1. **Disagreement 1**: Different factual beliefs — Forecaster 1 claims the value has already dropped to 88, while others assume it's still near 93. This is verifiable by checking the actual current Google Trends data.

2. **Disagreement 2**: Mix of different factual beliefs (whether the UK Feb 25 rule is generating significant US search interest) and different weighting of the same evidence (how much news cycle decay matters over 8 days).

3. **Disagreement 3**: Primarily different weighting of the same evidence — all forecasters acknowledge mean reversion pressure but disagree on its magnitude relative to countervailing forces.
