Resolution of Disagreements:

**Disagreement 1 (Feb 18 starting value - already declining or still elevated):** The targeted research was UNABLE to resolve this. The agent report confirms that only the Feb 16 value of 93 is known (from the 30-day window ending Feb 16), and the Feb 17 and Feb 18 values from the resolution window (Jan 27 - Feb 26) are unavailable. Forecaster 1's claim that the value dropped to ~88 by Feb 18 cannot be verified or refuted. This remains the largest source of disagreement.

**Disagreement 2 (Whether news catalysts sustain interest through Feb 26):** The research PARTIALLY resolves this in favor of sustained interest. The evidence confirms:
- The library passport closure story (Feb 13) is generating significant ongoing coverage, with articles appearing as late as Feb 16 on mlive, and bipartisan Congressional letters being sent to Secretary Rubio. This suggests the story has legs beyond a single news cycle.
- The UK Feb 25 passport rule is confirmed as a major, imminent deadline with extensive coverage (Guardian Feb 13, Times Feb 17, VisaHQ Feb 14, Sunday Guardian Feb 13). The Feb 25 deadline falls within the resolution window, meaning peak search interest for this topic likely occurs during Feb 18-26, not before.
- The UK eVisa full switch on Feb 25 adds another layer of passport-related news that will peak during the resolution window.

**Disagreement 3 (Mean reversion strength):** Not directly resolved, but the confirmation of multiple active news catalysts with peak relevance during the resolution window suggests mean reversion pressure is counterbalanced by genuine demand drivers.

Updated Analysis:

The key finding is that the UK Feb 25 passport deadline is a concrete, date-specific event that falls squarely within the resolution window. This is not a decaying news story - it's an approaching deadline that will generate increasing coverage and search interest as Feb 25 approaches. Multiple outlets (Guardian, Times, VisaHQ, Sunday Guardian) covered this extensively in the Feb 13-17 period, and coverage will likely intensify as the deadline nears.

However, the UK passport rule primarily affects British dual nationals, not Americans. Its impact on US Google Trends for "passport" would be indirect - through US-based British dual nationals and general news coverage. The library closure story is more directly US-relevant and appears to have sustained media attention.

The inability to verify the Feb 18 starting value is a significant limitation. If Forecaster 1 is correct that it's already at ~88, then the combination of news catalysts could push it back up (supporting "Increases" or "Doesn't change"). If it's still near 93, there's more room for both increases and decreases.

Given:
- Multiple confirmed news catalysts with peak relevance during the window (especially UK Feb 25 deadline)
- Ongoing US library closure coverage with Congressional involvement
- Seasonal late-February travel planning
- But uncertainty about the starting value
- Weekend suppression effect (Feb 22-23)
- Some mean reversion risk from elevated baseline

I find the evidence modestly supports the "Increases" camp over the "Decreases" camp, primarily because the UK Feb 25 deadline creates a concrete late-window catalyst. However, the unresolved starting value question prevents a strong shift. I'll adjust slightly toward Increases and slightly away from Decreases compared to the weighted average.

Confidence: MEDIUM

Probabilities: [42, 28, 30]
