# Summary of Article: State Department Order Ends Passport Services at Many Libraries

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Policy Implementation Date**: February 13, 2026 - US State Department ordered nonprofit public libraries to stop accepting passport applications

2. **Scale of Impact**:
   - Approximately 1,400 public libraries could be affected (according to American Library Association estimate)
   - This represents about 15% of all public libraries in the United States
   - The State Department has more than 7,500 passport acceptance facilities nationwide

3. **Passport Demand**: More than 23.3 million passport applications were submitted in fiscal year 2025

4. **Financial Impact**: In some cases, execution fees from processing passport applications made up as much as 12% of library operating budgets

## Policy Details:

- **Reason for Change**: Federal regulations prohibit nongovernmental organizations from collecting and handling passport application fees
- **Who Can Continue**: Government-run libraries can continue operating as passport acceptance facilities; nonprofit libraries cannot
- **Alternative Locations**: Passport services remain available at post offices, courthouses, and government offices

## Accessibility Concerns:

- Libraries often served suburban and rural communities where government offices are limited
- Libraries typically offered evening and weekend appointments, convenient for working families
- Some libraries had provided passport services for nearly two decades
- State Department claims most Americans still live within 20 miles of an acceptance facility

## Political Response:

Pennsylvania Representatives Madeleine Dean and John Joyce introduced bipartisan legislation to allow 501(c)(3) nonprofit libraries to continue accepting passport applications by amending the Passport Act of 1920. A companion measure was also introduced in the Senate.

# Summary of Article: "Dual nationals to be denied entry to UK from 25 February unless they have British passport"

**Source:** The Guardian  
**Date:** February 13, 2026  
**Author:** Lisa O'Carroll

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **New border control implementation date:** February 25, 2026
2. **Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) cost:** £16 for visitors on short stays
3. **Certificate of entitlement cost:** £589 (required for dual nationals who want to use their non-British passport)
4. **Processing time:** There is a weeks-long backlog for obtaining certificates of entitlement

## Policy Details:

- Starting February 25, 2026, everyone traveling to the UK will need permission to travel, unless they are British or Irish citizens or otherwise exempt
- Dual British nationals must either:
  - Present a valid British passport, OR
  - Obtain a certificate of entitlement (costing £589) to attach to their second nationality passport
- Failure to comply may result in being denied boarding on flights, ferries, or trains to the UK

## Opinions from Named Sources:

**Home Office spokesperson:**
- Stated the requirement is part of a digitization program to enable a "seamless travel experience"
- Claims it gives the government "greater power to stop those who pose a threat from setting foot in the country and gives us a fuller picture of immigration"

**Monique Hawkins (Head of Policy and Advocacy at The 3 million):**
- Called for a low-cost, one-off travel authorization similar to Canada's system instead of the £589 certificate
- Urged action "to ensure British citizens are not locked out of their own country"

## Anecdotal Evidence (unnamed/less reliable sources):

- A British woman in Germany expressed concern about her children being affected, calling the change "short-notice, shortsighted, arbitrary" and noting that maintaining two passports is an expensive "luxury"
- A British woman in Spain (30+ years) who naturalized as Spanish due to Brexit faces legal risk to her Spanish nationality if she presents a British passport (Spain requires renouncing previous nationality)
- A dual British-Italian national who has never held a British passport discovered he may be stranded after a work trip, as he cannot obtain the certificate before his February travel date

# Summary of Article: British Dual Citizens Warned About New UK Passport Rule

**Source:** The Sunday Guardian, February 13, 2026, by Prakriti Parul

## Key Facts and Policy Details:

**Effective Date:** February 25, 2026

**New Requirement:** British dual citizens must present either:
- A valid British passport, OR
- A foreign passport with a Certificate of Entitlement to the Right of Abode

to enter the UK. They can no longer use only a non-British passport without additional documentation.

**Policy Context:** The changes are tied to full enforcement of the Home Office's Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) scheme, which requires carriers to verify passenger documentation before departure. British and Irish citizens are exempt from needing an ETA, but dual nationals cannot use an ETA obtained with a foreign passport.

**Timeline:** Travelers arriving on or before February 24, 2026 can still use a valid non-British passport without additional documentation.

## Who Is Affected:

- All British dual citizens living or traveling overseas, including those in EU countries, Australia, Canada, and the United States
- Children born abroad to British parents who hold British citizenship by descent
- Applies regardless of whether the individual has ever held a British passport or formally interacted with UK authorities

## Costs:

- British adult passport: £94.50 (online application; overseas applications slightly higher)
- Certificate of Entitlement: £589 (substantially higher than passport cost)
- Child passport: £61.50 (valid for 5 years)
- Processing time for Certificate of Entitlement: approximately three weeks for overseas applications

## Official Rationale:

A Home Office spokesperson stated the changes aim to digitize the immigration system using ETAs to provide "a more seamless travel experience," give authorities "greater power to stop those who pose a threat," and provide "a fuller picture of immigration."

A House of Commons briefing noted that while there is no legal requirement for British citizens to travel on a British passport, pre-departure checks make it difficult to travel without one. The Home Office had been advising dual nationals to travel on British passports for many months but hadn't been strictly enforcing the requirement to allow time to adjust.

<Agent_report>
Query: What is the current Google Trends interest value for the search term "passport" in the US as of February 18, 2026? Check the URL https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=passport&date=2026-01-27%202026-02-26 and report the specific daily values for February 16, 17, and 18 if available.
The objective was to extract the daily U S “interest over time” values for the Google Trends term passport on 16, 17 and 18 February 2026 from the locked-scale URL https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=passport&date=2026-01-27%202026-02-26.  

What can be confirmed from the material retrieved so far is limited to a single data-point:

• 16 Feb 2026: value = 93 (source: contextual note that cites the 30-day URL ending 2026-02-16).  

No search result returns the numeric timeline values for 17 Feb 2026 or 18 Feb 2026 from the required 2026-01-27 → 2026-02-26 range, nor do they reconfirm the 16 Feb value using the same range. None of the articles and developer posts supplied by the search touch on the raw Trends figures; they discuss passport-related news, Google Discover updates, or technical guides to downloading Trends CSV but do not embed the specific dataset.

Consequences for the forecasting context  
• Because the 18 Feb 2026 value is still unknown, the core criterion for the Metaculus forecasting question (comparing 18 Feb with 26 Feb) cannot yet be evaluated.  
• Without the 17 Feb value the trajectory immediately before the target date is also unknown, so we cannot judge short-term momentum or volatility.  
• Even the cited 93 for 16 Feb is scaled relative to the 30-day window ending 16 Feb, not the 31-day window ending 26 Feb. Owing to Google Trends’ rescaling, that figure may differ once the longer window is used; the locked-range numbers are therefore still required.

Information gap  
Daily Google Trends values for 16, 17 and 18 February 2026 within the exact date range 2026-01-27 to 2026-02-26 are still missing. These numbers are indispensable to:

1. Report the “current” value for 18 Feb 2026 requested in the original query.  
2. Supply the 16 and 17 Feb datapoints.  
3. Enable forecasters to quantify whether search interest on 26 Feb changes by more than three points relative to 18 Feb.

Until those three values are obtained—either by viewing the URL directly, downloading the accompanying CSV, or querying the (alpha) Google Trends API—no definitive answer can be given.</Agent_report>

<Summary source="https://www.visahq.com/news/2026-02-14/gb/uk-confirms-full-switch-to-evisas-for-all-visitor-visa-nationals-from-25-february-2026/">
# Summary of Article: UK confirms full switch to eVisas for all visitor-visa nationals from 25 February 2026

## Key Facts and Dates:
- **Implementation date**: 25 February 2026 - the UK will switch entirely to digital visas (eVisas) for anyone requiring a visitor visa
- **Announcement date**: 14 February (2026, based on context)
- **Scope**: This affects all visitor-visa nationals; paper vignettes, biometric-residence-permit stickers, and passport stamps will be eliminated for this group
- **System**: eVisas will be linked to UK Visas & Immigration (UKVI) online accounts

## Technical Details:
- Airlines, ferry operators, and rail industry have spent the past year upgrading departure-control systems to interface with the government's new Carrier Check API
- The API validates eVisas in real time at check-in
- Unlike Electronic Travel Authorisations (ETAs), eVisas show entry clearance, work/study permissions, and stay conditions
- This is part of a wider digital-border programme already replacing physical BRP cards for resident migrants

## Practical Implications:
- Carriers will refuse boarding to passengers whose passports are not digitally linked to their eVisa
- UKVI has started sending SMS and email notifications to existing visa holders
- Travelers need to create UKVI accounts, upload passport details, and generate share codes
- Employers must conduct compliance checks to ensure employees can generate share codes for right-to-work verification

## Expert Opinion (Named Source):
- **Zubair Khan, partner at Fragomen in London**: Identifies the "biggest practical pitfall" as dual-national employees traveling on non-British passports who assume their visa is visible to airlines. He recommends a pre-trip checklist including logging into UKVI accounts at least 48 hours before departure.

## Additional Context:
- UKVI claims the change will enhance security and reduce fraud, citing success of digital status under the EU Settlement Scheme
- Data-privacy groups are calling for clearer redress mechanisms if passengers are wrongly denied boarding
- Recommendation for business travelers to carry evidence of approved applications (decision emails or share-code screenshots) during the initial transition period

# Summary of Al Jazeera Article on Dual-National Soldiers in Israeli Military

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **More than 50,000 soldiers** in the Israeli military hold at least one other citizenship, with a majority holding US or European passports (data obtained by Israeli NGO Hatzlacha through Israel's Freedom of Information Law)

- **Breakdown by nationality** (as of March 2025, 17 months into the Gaza war):
  - United States: 12,135 soldiers (plus 1,207 with additional third passports)
  - France: 6,127 nationals
  - Russia: 5,067 nationals
  - Ukraine: 3,901 nationals
  - Germany: 1,668 nationals
  - United Kingdom: 1,686 soldiers (plus 383 with additional third passports)
  - Brazil: 1,686 soldiers
  - Argentina: 609 nationals
  - South Africa: 589 nationals
  - Canada: 505 nationals
  - Other countries: Colombia (112), Mexico (181)

- Israel's military comprises approximately **169,000 active personnel and 465,000 reservists**, of whom nearly **8% hold dual or multiple citizenships**

- Since October 7, 2023, Israel's war on Gaza has killed at least **72,061 people** (as stated in the article)

## Named Expert Opinion:

**Ilias Bantekas**, professor of transnational law at Hamad Bin Khalifa University in Qatar:
- "War crimes incur criminal liability under international law, irrespective of what the law of nationality says"
- "Dual nationality is immaterial to criminal liability"
- Dual nationals "may in addition be liable under laws that prevent military service in foreign conflicts or joining armies of other nations"
- The major challenge is "getting [them] on your territory and putting them before a court"
- Prosecuting foreign nationals has been "pretty much the norm" (citing Nazi Germans, Japanese officers, and Bosnian conflict cases)

## Legal Actions and Proceedings:

- **UK (April 2024)**: Palestinian Centre for Human Rights (PCHR) and Public Interest Law Centre (PILC) filed a 240-page report to Metropolitan Police against 10 British individuals for alleged war crimes

- **Germany (September 2024)**: Case filed against a 25-year-old Munich-born soldier for participating in killing of Palestinian civilians, documented near al-Quds and Nasser hospitals (November 2023-March 2024), member of "Refaim" unit

- **Belgium (October 2024)**: Judicial investigation opened into 21-year-old Belgian-Israeli citizen, also member of Refaim unit

- Legal proceedings against Refaim unit members also underway in France, Italy, and South Africa

## Additional Context:

- UK Foreign Office statement (May): "The UK recognises the right of British dual nationals to serve in the legitimately recognised armed forces of the country of their other nationality. Allegations of war crimes should be submitted to the Met Police for investigation."

- Israel's mandatory military service law exempts dual nationals residing abroad, making enlistment voluntary—an important legal distinction

- The International Centre of Justice for Palestinians (ICJP) launched the "Global 195" campaign in March 2024 to hold Israeli and dual-national individuals accountable

- The Hind Rajab Foundation (Belgium-based) is collecting data with identifiable information about Israeli soldiers

**Relevance to forecast question**: This article does not contain information directly relevant to predicting Google Trends search interest for "passport" between February 18-26, 2026. The article discusses dual citizenship and passports in the context of military service and war crimes accountability, but does not indicate any specific events or developments that would occur during the forecast period.

# Summary of Article: State Department Orders Libraries Nationwide to No Longer Process Passport Applications

**Source:** mlive  
**Date:** February 16, 2026  
**Author:** Matt Durr

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **Policy Change:** The State Department ordered certain non-profit public libraries nationwide to stop processing passport applications because they no longer qualify as Passport Acceptance Facilities.

2. **Legal Justification:** A State Department spokesperson stated that federal laws "clearly prohibit non-governmental organizations" from collecting and retaining fees for passport applications. Government-run libraries may continue to process applications.

3. **Implementation Timeline:** 
   - The rule officially went into effect on Friday, February 13, 2026
   - Libraries began being notified of the move last fall (2025)
   - Some libraries, like the Otis Library in Norwich, Connecticut, stopped offering the service in November 2025

4. **Scale of Impact:**
   - State Department claims affected libraries make up "less than one percent" of their total network of over 7,500 acceptance facilities nationwide
   - American Library Association estimates about 1,400 mostly non-profit public libraries could be impacted
   - It is unclear how many of those libraries actually participated in the program

5. **State-by-State Breakdown of Non-Profit Libraries:**
   - Pennsylvania: 85% of public libraries are nonprofit
   - Maine: 56% are nonprofit
   - Rhode Island: 54% are nonprofit
   - New York: 47% are nonprofit
   - Connecticut: 46% are nonprofit

6. **Access Statistics:** The State Department estimates that 99% of the U.S. population lives within 20 miles of a designated passport processing location (including post offices, county clerk's offices, or government-run libraries).

## Named Source Opinions:

1. **Cathleen Special, Executive Director of Otis Library (Norwich, Connecticut):** Noted that "We still get calls daily seeking that service" and that "Our community was so used to us offering this." Her library had offered the service for 18 years.

2. **Bipartisan Congressional Members (from Connecticut, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, and Pennsylvania):** Sent a letter to Secretary of State Marco Rubio stating:
   - "In a time when demand for passports is surging, libraries are among the most accessible passport acceptance facilities, particularly for working families and rural residents"
   - Expressed concern that the move would cause several libraries to cut staff and programs due to loss of processing fees

## Additional Context:

- The State Department did not answer questions about why this has become an issue now after being offered for many years
- The State Department spokesperson said they "will work to identify new eligible program partners in the impacted area" if removal of an ineligible facility affects passport services
</Summary>
