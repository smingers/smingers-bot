Analysis:
To judge whether Google search interest in “passport” will move noticeably (±4 points) over the next eight days, the most useful historical context is:
• Normal seasonality: U.S. passport searches usually rise ahead of spring-break travel (late Feb–Mar), dip after summer, and spike again in early winter holidays. Comparing patterns from previous years will show whether a late-February uptick is typical.
• Short-term news catalysts: Any fresh State Department announcements (e.g., fee increases, processing delays), Real ID-related reminders, or media stories about passport backlogs can create abrupt surges in searches. Recent or scheduled policy changes around Feb 2026 therefore matter.
• Travel/tourism context: Headlines on record travel demand for Presidents’ Day weekend or airlines urging early passport renewal could also drive interest.

Accordingly, I need (a) general web pages describing historical “passport” demand patterns, (b) the latest news coverage about U.S. passport issues in Feb 2026, and (c) a broader scan for upcoming catalysts (price hikes, Real ID, etc.). Finally, I’ll pull a Google Trends 90-day series for “passport” to quantify recent volatility.
