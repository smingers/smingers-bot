The State Department cites this as longstanding legal requirements, though enforcement appears newly rigorous. No widespread fraud was reported; the policy aims to prevent potential vulnerabilities in fee collection by nonprofits.\n\n**Impact:**\n\n- Only government-operated libraries remain eligible to process passport applications\n- Nonprofit libraries that had operated smoothly for years must halt services\n- Rural and working families face the hardest impact, potentially needing unpaid time off or long drives to alternatives\n- Libraries like Lancaster Public Library in Pennsylvania and Otis Library in Norwich, Connecticut (which served the community for 18 years) confirmed receipt of deactivation notices\n\n**Political Response:**\n\nBipartisan lawmakers from Connecticut, New Jersey, New York, and Maryland wrote to Secretary of State Marco Rubio urging reinstatement. They warned of closures or program cuts at libraries dependent on processing fees.\n\n**Context:**\n\nThe timing coincides with heightened scrutiny under the current administration and follows other recent adjustments, including gender marker restrictions per Executive Order 14168. Real ID enforcement from May 2025 amplified passport demand, straining facilities.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://abcnews.com/GMA/Travel/renew-us-passport-online/story?id=113618419\">\n# Summary of Article: \"State Department announces US passport renewal now fully available online\"\n\n**Source:** ABC News  \n**Date of announcement:** Wednesday (article context suggests this is recent to Feb 16, 2026)\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **Program Launch:** The State Department announced that online passport renewal is now fully available to the public, expanding from a previous pilot program.\n\n2. **Expected Usage:** The State Department expects 5 million Americans to use the online renewal system every year.\n\n3. **Processing Time:** Routine processing time for online renewals is 6 to 8 weeks (not including mailing times).\n\n4. **Historical Context:**\n   - The digital renewal system was first introduced in 2021 through an executive order from President Joe Biden\n   - Applications were halted indefinitely in 2023 due to backlog delays\n   - Earlier this month (February 2026), the agency opened a limited number of applications on a first-come, first-serve basis at 1 pm ET\n   - Last year, the U.S. Department of State issued an all-time record high of more than 24 million U.S. passport books and cards in a 12-month span\n\n## Eligibility Requirements:\n\n- U.S. citizens and residents ages 25 and older\n- Must have had an existing passport for 10 years that is still in possession\n- Passport can be expired but must have expired within the last 5 years or will expire in the coming year\n- Not changing name, gender, date of birth, or place of birth\n- Live in a U.S. state or territory\n- Applying for a regular tourist passport\n- Able to upload a recent digital photo and pay online with debit or credit card\n\n## Named Source:\n\n**Rena Bitter, Assistant Secretary of State for the Bureau of Consular Affairs** provided exclusive comments to ABC News about the convenience and scope of the new system.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://thepointsguy.com/news/partial-government-shutdown-airport-impact/\">\n# Summary of \"Travel delays?

The changes require renewal only for individuals whose DNI is expired or who must update their document due to age-related obligations. Specifically, renewal is mandatory for those whose DNI has expired, as well as for individuals who must update their documents based on age thresholds. The expiration date is visible on the front of the DNI, and having an expired document prevents access to official procedures, social programs, educational enrollment, and various public and private services. The renewal process requires a prior appointment, available through the Mi Argentina app or the official RENAPER website. On the assigned day, individuals must present themselves at the corresponding Civil Registry or RENAPER Documentation Center with the appointment confirmation. The updated fees for 2026 have been established, though the exact amounts are not specified in the article. Individuals with valid DNI are not required to renew but may do so voluntarily to obtain the new electronic format.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 04:19 PM\nSource:[El Cronista](https://www.cronista.com/economia-politica/cambia-el-dni-a-partir-de-marzo-todas-estas-personas-deberan-renovar-su-documento-sin-excepcion/)\n\n**New British passport rule from February 25 'disgusting' and 'ridiculous' - Birmingham Live**\nA new UK passport rule set to take effect on February 25, 2026, requires British dual nationals to present either a British passport or a digital certificate of entitlement to enter the UK, ending the previous practice of using a foreign passport alone. The change has sparked widespread criticism, with UK expatriates calling the policy 'disgusting,' 'ridiculous,' 'scandalous,' and 'unacceptable.' Many dual nationals, including a 78-year-old in Australia and a 79-year-old in Germany, expressed outrage over the financial burden\u2014up to \u00a31,178 for a passport and \u00a3589 for the certificate\u2014feeling they are being treated as threats despite decades of ties to the UK. One woman stated she feels 'shut out of my own country' and described the rule as a 'betrayal,' noting she has lived in the UK for nearly 16 years, paid taxes, and owns property there. Others expressed concern over being denied access to their homes and jobs, especially if their employers do not allow remote work. Some lamented the irony that holding only an EU passport would be a more favorable situation than holding dual British citizenship. The policy does not automatically issue passports or certificates to new dual nationals, leaving many unprepared. Critics argue the government failed to consider the real-world impact on affected individuals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 03:02 PM\nSource:[Birmingham Mail](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/travel/new-british-passport-rule-february-33448365)\n\n**From July 1, 2026: Major Reforms to Polish Identity Cards and Passports**\nThe Polish government has proposed a new law to reform identity documents, with changes set to take effect on July 1, 2026. Key changes include extending the validity of identity cards for individuals aged 70 and above from 10 to 15 years, reducing the need for frequent renewals. The new rules will allow applicants to designate a different municipal office for document collection, not just the one where the application was submitted, improving accessibility for those working or living away from their registered residence. A new obligation will require municipalities to notify cardholders electronically (if an email is on file) or via postal mail (using PESEL data) if a card is invalidated due to data changes\u2014though this duty excludes name changes after marriage. For minors, the loss or destruction of an identity card can now be reported online, and only a parent with full parental authority may apply for a replacement, under a sworn declaration. The reforms aim to reduce unintentional use of expired documents, which currently may result in fines up to 5,000 z\u0142oty. Parallel work is underway on a new passport design, featuring enhanced security features, potential regional motifs based on voivodeship, fewer pages to reduce cost and weight, and ongoing debate over the removal of the motto 'B\u00f3g, Honor, Ojczyzna,' which has drawn criticism and complaints to the Ombudsman. The focus remains on modernization and increased security.\nOriginal language: pl\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 02:14 PM\nSource:[kobieta.gazeta.pl](https://kobieta.gazeta.pl/pieniadze/7,197740,32608508,zmiany-w-dowodach-osobistych-juz-1-lipca-seniorzy-zyskaja.html)\n\n**Ryanair making British passport rule change from next Wednesday - Birmingham Live**\nRyanair will implement a new passport rule effective from February 25, 2026, allowing dual British nationals to board flights to the UK without a British passport, provided they can prove British nationality. According to Ryanair, acceptable documents include a valid or expired British passport, a certificate of entitlement to the right of abode, or any other UK status such as an old stamp or vignette with indefinite leave to remain. The change is in response to new UK immigration rules requiring non-visa nationals to present either a British passport or an electronic travel authorisation (ETA) to board flights to the UK. The Home Office states that all British citizens have the right of abode in the UK, meaning they are exempt from immigration control, but must be able to demonstrate this right to avoid delays or denied boarding. The rule change aims to reassure British dual nationals abroad who are concerned about the new requirements. The government briefing paper confirms that British citizens have the right to live or work in the UK without immigration restrictions, but carriers must verify their status.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 11:16 AM\nSource:[Birmingham Mail](https://www.birminghammail.co.uk/travel/ryanair-making-british-passport-rule-33446046)\n\n**New 2026 Argentine Passport: Requirements, How to Apply, and Who Must Renew**\nStarting in February 2026, Argentina will implement a new passport design aimed at reducing fraud, streamlining identity checks, and modernizing the system to meet international standards. The updated passport features a personalized polycarbonate page with laser engraving for identifying data, 34 pages, and enhanced security measures. Existing passports remain valid until their expiration date, so renewal is not mandatory unless the passport is nearing expiry. Passports for individuals over 18 are valid for 10 years from the date of issue, meaning those issued in 2016 must renew. For those under 18, validity is 5 years, so passports issued in 2021 require renewal. Requirements for renewal or new applications vary by age and situation: adults must present a valid DNI card and, if available, the previous passport. Individuals with disabilities must provide a judicial testimonial appointing a guardian or curator, the guardian\u2019s DNI, judicial authorization if applicable, and explicit consent from the responsible party. Minors must be accompanied by a parent or legal representative with a valid DNI; if not accompanied, a notarized or judicially certified permission is required. Emancipated minors must present a judicial document. The process involves selecting a Civil Registry or Renaper Documentation Center via the Mi Argentina app, attending the appointment with the appointment confirmation and payment receipt, keeping the application confirmation, and tracking the process online using an ID. The passport will be delivered by mail and can be received by the applicant or an adult with the application confirmation.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 11:06 AM\nSource:[Diario El D\u00eda                     ](https://www.eldia.com/nota/2026-2-18-7-26-0-nuevo-pasaporte-2026-requisitos-como-sacarlo-y-quienes-deben-hacer-la-actualizacion-informacion-general)\n\n**Why the New UK eVisa Will Make Traveling from Nigeria Easier Than Ever : Find Out How! - Travel And Tour World**\nStarting February 25, 2026, Nigerian nationals applying for a UK Visit visa will receive a digital eVisa instead of a physical sticker (vignette) in their passport, as part of the UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI)\u2019s move to digitize the border system. The change, which applies only to future applications, maintains the same eligibility criteria and biometric requirements but enhances security, speed, and convenience. Applicants will access their visa electronically via a free UKVI account, eliminating risks of loss, theft, or damage associated with paper visas. Passports will be returned faster, and travelers can manage their immigration status online anytime. The transition supports the UK\u2019s broader strategy to modernize visa processes, align with global digital trends, and improve customer satisfaction. Mrs. Gill Lever OBE, British Deputy High Commissioner in Abuja, stated the initiative aims to make the UK more accessible for Nigerian travelers for business, tourism, and study. The move is expected to boost tourism, economic ties, and people-to-people connections between the UK and Nigeria. Existing physical visas remain valid until expiration. The shift reflects a global trend toward digital travel systems, positioning the UK as a competitive and modern destination.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 08:51 AM\nSource:[Travel And Tour World](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/why-the-new-uk-evisa-will-make-traveling-from-nigeria-easier-than-ever-find-out-how/)\n\n**Millions of Brits face new passport rules next week including \u00a3589 charges - Daily Record**\nStarting February 25, 2026, dual British citizens\u2014including children\u2014will be required to present either a valid British passport or a \u00a3589 certificate of entitlement when traveling to the UK, according to new border rules. The change affects approximately 1.2 million dual nationals worldwide and is part of a broader digital immigration initiative. Travelers without a British passport may face boarding refusal unless they hold a valid Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA), which costs \u00a316 (with a planned increase to \u00a320) and allows multiple trips of up to six months over two years. Although British and Irish citizens are exempt from the ETA requirement, they must still meet entry criteria. The Home Office stated that public information has been available since October 2024 and a communications campaign began in 2023. The policy aligns with practices in the US, Canada, and Australia, aiming to create a more secure and streamlined border system. Critics have raised concerns about inadequate notice and poor communication, warning of potential disruptions to holidays and business trips. The government maintains that carriers cannot verify British citizenship without the required documentation, which may result in delays or denied boarding.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 06:06 PM\nSource:[Daily Record](https://www.dailyrecord.co.uk/lifestyle/travel/millions-brits-face-new-passport-36737996)\n\n**Border Agents Are Using New Tech: 9 Reasons Travelers Are Getting Pulled Aside More Often**\nBorder screening processes are becoming increasingly automated, biometric, and data-driven, leading to more frequent secondary screenings for travelers. The EU Entry/Exit System (EES), operational since October 12, 2025, and set to fully roll out by April 10, 2026, replaces manual passport stamping with digital entry/exit records and biometric checks for non-EU nationals. The EU\u2019s ETIAS travel authorization system is scheduled to launch in the last quarter of 2026. The UK has expanded its Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA), which costs \u00a316 and is not a guarantee of entry. In the U.S., Customs and Border Protection (CBP) continues expanding facial biometric processing at airports. Nine common reasons travelers are pulled aside include: facial recognition mismatches due to outdated photos or appearance changes (e.g., weight loss, beards, glasses); first-time biometric enrollment delays; inconsistencies in name, passport number, or date of birth across systems; incorrect or expired travel authorizations (e.g., ETA, ETIAS); passport flags from databases like INTERPOL\u2019s SLTD (stolen/lost documents); overstays detected via digital tracking under EES; risk scoring of flight data (e.g., last-minute tickets, inconsistent travel patterns); prohibited or undeclared items in luggage; and opting out of automated systems, which routes travelers to manual checks. Travelers are advised to ensure passport photos are current, use one consistent passport from booking to border, update travel documents after renewals, carry proof of onward travel, declare unknown items, and remain calm during inspections. According to the article, staying polite and prepared with essential documents helps prevent escalation.\nOriginal language: en-US\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 05:15 PM\nSource:[Guessing Headlights](https://guessingheadlights.com/border-agents-are-using-new-tech-9-reasons-travelers-are-getting-pulled-aside-more-often/)\n\n**UK Visa System Overhaul, Nigeria Joins the Digital Revolution with eVisas Replacing Traditional Visa Stickers for All New Applicants from February 25 - Travel And Tour World**\nStarting February 25, 2026, the United Kingdom will replace physical visa stickers with digital eVisas for all new Nigerian applicants, as part of a broader effort to modernize its immigration system. Under the new system, approved visa information will be stored securely in a UK Visas and Immigration (UKVI) online account, eliminating the need for physical visa vignettes in passports. The change aims to enhance border security, reduce processing times, and improve efficiency by enabling real-time verification of immigration status. While the application process\u2014including online submission and biometric data collection\u2014will remain unchanged, applicants will gain the ability to access, track, and manage their visa status digitally. Existing Nigerian nationals with valid physical visas will not be affected and may continue using their current documents until expiration. The UK government emphasizes that eVisas are more secure than physical stickers, as they are less prone to loss, theft, or tampering, and allow for faster, more accurate immigration checks. This move aligns with a global trend toward digital visa systems and represents a key step in the UK\u2019s transition to a fully digital border regime, benefiting business travellers, students, and frequent visitors with a more streamlined and secure travel experience.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 08:12 AM\nSource:[Travel And Tour World](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/uk-visa-system-overhaul-nigeria-joins-the-digital-revolution-with-evisas-replacing-traditional-visa-stickers-for-all-new-applicants-from-february-25/)\n\n**UK Dual Citizens to Face New Passport Rules: What You Need to Know Before 25 February 2026 - Travel And Tour World**\nStarting 25 February 2026, UK dual nationals will face new passport rules requiring them to enter the UK using either a British passport or a certificate of entitlement. This change, driven by the need for clearer border control and to prevent overstays, applies to individuals holding dual citizenship with countries that are part of the UK\u2019s visa-waiver programme (including the US, Canada, Australia, Japan, and EU nations). Under the new system, dual nationals must prove British citizenship when travelling, as the UK\u2019s Electronic Travel Authorisation (ETA) will not be available to them. The ETA, initially introduced in April 2025, will be fully enforced from 25 February 2026. For those born abroad but British by descent, obtaining a British passport or certificate of entitlement is essential. Airline policies may vary, and dual nationals must ensure consistency in documentation, especially when returning to their country of residence using their foreign passport. Irish citizens are exempt and may continue to travel freely under the Common Travel Area agreement. The Home Office states the rule aims to enhance security and immigration accuracy, though it may add complexity and cost for some travellers.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 07:18 AM\nSource:[Travel And Tour World](https://www.travelandtourworld.com/news/article/uk-dual-citizens-to-face-new-passport-rules-what-you-need-to-know-before-25-february-2026/)\n\n**Confirmed | U.S. to Ban Passport Renewal in 2026 for Certain Passports**\nThe U.S. government will prohibit the renewal of certain passports issued before 2021, effective in 2026, according to authorities.

The primary objective of the new policy is to make the process of obtaining and renewing passports simpler, faster, fully digital, and more secure. The policy also aims to prevent fraud and reduce unnecessary delays in processing. According to Patrika News, the changes are designed to streamline the entire application and verification process.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: February 08, 2026 02:47 AM\nSource:[Patrika News](https://www.patrika.com/national-news/passport-policy-2026-digital-easy-fast-20332201)\n\n**Big Passport Rule Change For 2026: Govt Sets Feb 15 Deadline-Full Details**\nThe Government of India has introduced new passport regulations effective February 15, 2026, aimed at simplifying the application process, enhancing security, and accelerating service delivery. The updated rules streamline document requirements by prioritizing digital proofs such as Aadhaar and other government-issued IDs, reducing paperwork and the need for multiple office visits. Applications with incomplete or incorrect documents risk outright rejection, underscoring the importance of accuracy in digital submissions. A major reform is the digitization of the police verification process, which will now be conducted largely online, reducing verification time from weeks to days in many cases\u2014some even allowing passport dispatch before post-issue verification. The government\u2019s passport portal has been upgraded with enhanced features for online form filling, document uploads, appointment booking, and real-time tracking of application status, eliminating reliance on intermediaries. Special provisions for minors now accept parental consent and digital birth certificates or school IDs, expediting children\u2019s passport issuance. Additionally, the government plans to expand the network of passport centers to improve access in smaller towns and rural areas. The overarching goal is to balance speed, security, and convenience across the entire passport lifecycle. Prospective applicants are advised to prepare well before the February 15, 2026, deadline to ensure compliance.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 01:50 PM\nSource:[english](https://news.abplive.com/news/big-passport-rule-change-for-2026-govt-sets-feb-15-deadline-full-details-1825485)\n\n**Government Announces Updates to Electronic ID and Passport: Key Changes Explained**\nStarting February 1, 2026, the Registro Nacional de las Personas (Renaper) in Argentina will implement updated designs and security features for the electronic ID (DNI) and passport, in line with international standards set by the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO). The new electronic DNI will retain its polycarbonate card format with contactless chip but will include enhanced security measures: an Argentine escarapela framing the photo, national symbols such as the Sun of May, glaciers, the Andes, and a bicontinental map as graphic elements, tactile patterns to deter counterfeiting, full laser engraving of personalized data, a ghost image within the transparent window, and a changing laser image (CLI) combining repeated photos and the document\u2019s serial letter. The new passport design, approved under Disposition 54/2026, features a personalized polycarbonate page with laser engraving, 34 pages total, and security measures across three levels. Both existing DNI and passports issued before the update remain valid until their expiration date, with no mandatory early replacement. The changes respond to a rising trend in identity-related crimes, both domestically and internationally. Pablo Luis Santos, who signed the dispositions, will leave Renaper on February 1, 2026, to be succeeded by Diego Sebasti\u00e1n P\u00e9rez Lorgueilleux.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: January 30, 2026 07:50 PM\nSource:[Diario El Ciudadano](https://elciudadanoweb.com/el-gobierno-anuncio-actualizaciones-en-el-dni-electronico-y-el-pasaporte-cuales-son-los-cambios/)\n\n**Passport and ID Card Issuance Without Appointment Continues Until March 31, 2026 in Ecuador**\nThe issuance of passports and national identity cards without an appointment will continue until March 31, 2026, in Ecuador, according to the Civil Registry. The service will be available from 08:00 to 17:00, Monday through Friday, as announced on December 30, 2025. This extension follows positive results from previous no-appointment campaigns launched in September 2025, which showed high citizen participation, reduced wait times, and efficient, well-organized processes. Identity cards can be obtained at all Civil Registry agencies, requiring the printed payment receipt, the previous ID for renewal, or a report of loss or theft. The cost is $5 for a first-time card and $16 for renewal; individuals with a disability of 30% or more are exempt from payment. For passports, 27 agencies across 23 provinces will be operational, requiring applicants to present a payment receipt, a valid ID, the previous passport (if valid), or the Judicial Council's Lost Documents Form in case of loss or theft. Payments can be made via internal bank services, correspondent banking, or virtual agencies. Priority attention will be provided to children, pregnant women, older adults, and people with disabilities.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: December 30, 2025 05:02 PM\nSource:[Teleamazonas](https://www.teleamazonas.com/actualidad/noticias/ecuador/emision-cedulas-pasaportes-turno-mantiene-31-marzo-ecuador-108596/)\n\n**Major Life Changes for Russians Starting December 1, 2025: New Fees, Digital Passports, Pension Increases, and More**\nStarting December 1, 2025, several major changes will affect Russian citizens' daily lives. The new rules for calculating the vehicle recycling fee (utillization fee) take effect, now based on both engine power and displacement, significantly increasing costs for high-performance vehicles, hybrids, and electric cars\u2014especially those over 160 horsepower, which may face fees hundreds of times higher than before. A new digital passport system will be introduced, allowing citizens to use a QR code from the 'Gosuslugi' app in banks starting December 29, 2025, though only after prior in-person identification. Pensioners turning 80 in November 2025 will automatically receive a doubled fixed pension component, rising from 8,907.70 \u20bd to 17,815.40 \u20bd, with similar benefits for people with first-group disability and increased caregiver allowances. Consumer installment plans will be limited to a maximum of six months (reducing to four months by December 2027), with interest caps at 20% annually and bans on hidden fees or price discrimination based on payment method. If a customer\u2019s total installment debt exceeds 15,000 \u20bd, lenders must report contracts to credit bureaus. Debtors can now directly file complaints about collectors via the 'Gosuslugi' portal, with strict limits: no more than one call per day, two per week, and eight per month. The Federal Service of Judicial Executives (FSSE) will verify calls with telecom providers. A new biometric data collection experiment will begin at border checkpoints for foreign nationals, including fingerprints and photos, except for Belarusians, children under six, diplomats, and those with visa-free access. Vehicle licenses will no longer auto-renew after December 31, 2025\u2014those expiring on January 1, 2026, must be renewed manually. In multi-apartment buildings, installing external structures like air conditioners or awnings now requires approval from more than half of owners, and commercial use of common property (e.g., basements, rooftops, facades) requires a two-thirds majority vote. A new role, 'meeting administrator,' will be introduced to manage meetings and report results to the State Information System of Housing and Utilities (GIS \u0416\u041a\u0425).\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: November 30, 2025 09:03 PM\nSource:[\u041d\u041e\u0412\u041e\u0421\u0422\u0418 Mail.Ru](https://news.mail.ru/politics/68916438/)\n\n**Your passport on your iPhone is getting closer, but there will be restrictions**\nApple is preparing to allow users to store a digital version of their REAL ID-compliant U.S. passport in the Wallet app on iPhones running iOS 26, according to reports from the Money 20/20 keynote on October 26, 2025, where Apple Pay and Wallet VP Jennifer Bailey stated the feature is 'coming soon.' The digital passport will be limited to use at select domestic TSA checkpoints, including those for flights to Puerto Rico, and will be added by scanning the physical passport into Wallet\u2014mirroring the current process for licenses and student IDs. The feature is expected to roll out later in 2025, potentially via a point update or server-side activation, with early availability limited to select TSA lanes due to phased implementation. While the feature promises increased speed and convenience by reducing handoffs at checkpoints, it also introduces risks such as data breaches, identity theft, and privacy exposure if the device is lost or compromised. Apple recommends using a strong unique passcode, enabling two-factor authentication, keeping software updated, and verifying legitimate services before sharing identity data. Notably, a physical passport remains required for international border crossings. Google is pursuing a similar initiative, suggesting the possibility of future industry-wide standards.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 12:21 PM\nSource:[Digital Trends](https://www.digitaltrends.com/phones/your-passport-on-your-iphone-is-getting-closer-but-there-will-be-restrictions/)\n\n**Big Changes For Passports Rolling Out This Fall: What To Know**\nThe European Union will launch its Entry/Exit System (EES) on Sunday, Oct. 12, 2025, replacing most passport ink stamps with a digital record of entry and exit in the Schengen area that uses fingerprints and a photo. The transition period will see some travelers still receive stamps, with the system fully phased out by April 10, 2026. For U.S. travelers, the State Department has opened online passport renewal for eligible adults\u2014defined as applicants age 25 or older whose last 10\u2011year adult passport was issued 9 to 15 years ago\u2014allowing many to skip the line and apply on the web. Those who do not meet the criteria can still renew by mail or in person, per U.S.\u202fAGov guidance. Two additional changes effective this fall are: (1) the department has resumed issuing passports with an 'X' gender marker following a court order, providing an option for transgender and non\u2011binary applicants; and (2) all passport books are now REAL\u202fID\u2011compliant, enabling U.S. passports to be used for domestic flights and access to certain federal facilities. At passport agencies, payments are being modernized to accept credit/debit cards and mobile app payments, speeding in\u2011person visits. Travelers are advised to check their passport\u2019s expiration date and review online renewal eligibility before applying, plan for longer lines at Schengen borders after Oct. 12, and allow extra time for families, as children and first\u2011time applicants are not eligible for online renewal.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: September 28, 2025 12:45 PM\nSource:[Daily Voice](https://dailyvoice.com/connecticut/fairfield/big-changes-for-passports-rolling-out-this-fall-what-to-know/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
