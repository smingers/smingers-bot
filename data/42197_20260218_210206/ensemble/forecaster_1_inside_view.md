Analysis:

**1. Paraphrase of Question and Resolution Criteria**
Will Google Trends value for "parker kingston" on Feb 23, 2026 be within 3 points (Doesn't change), more than 3 points higher (Increases), or more than 3 points lower (Decreases) compared to Feb 18, 2026 value?

**(a) Source Analysis:**

**Primary News Sources (Feb 13-16, 2026):**
- Yahoo Sports, The Athletic, ESPN, SI.com: High-quality, recent factual reporting on Kingston's arrest (Feb 11), expulsion (Feb 14), and court proceedings. These are established sports journalism outlets with direct quotes from court documents and university statements. **Quality: High credibility, factual, dated Feb 13-16, 2026.**

- BYU Cougars On SI (Feb 16): Analyzes depth chart implications. Factual regarding roster changes, contains some speculation about future performance. **Quality: Moderate - mix of facts and projections.**

**AskNews Articles:**
The AskNews search returned NO articles about Parker Kingston. All results concern:
- Google I/O 2026 conference (May 19-20)
- Google/Warby Parker smart glasses development
- General tech and retail trends
- Real estate and other unrelated topics

**Critical Finding: Zero current news about Parker Kingston between Feb 18-23, 2026.** This is strong evidence supporting the "no catalyst" thesis from the outside view.

**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **No scheduled events in forecast window (Feb 18-23):** Multiple independent sources confirm Kingston's next court date is Feb 25, 2026 - AFTER the forecast window closes. No games, press conferences, or announcements scheduled. This is structural evidence that strongly supports status quo.

2. **Established decay pattern:** Google Trends data shows clear exponential decay from peak (100 on Feb 12) to current value (4 on Feb 18). The decay rate is slowing: 100→45→40→15→8→6→4. This mathematical pattern strongly suggests continued stabilization toward baseline.

3. **Historical base rate:** Kingston's own 90-day data shows 92% of 5-day windows result in changes ≤3 points. This is direct, quantitative evidence from the same subject.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Floor effect at baseline:** Current value (4) is only 1.5 points above 90-day mean (2.5). Limited downside room makes large decreases less probable. This is a logical structural constraint.

2. **Social media prohibition:** Court-ordered restriction prevents Kingston from generating new content. This reduces probability of self-generated news spikes.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Media cycle fatigue:** News is 6-7 days old by forecast start. Anecdotal observation that interest typically wanes without new developments.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Forecast Window:** 5 days (Feb 18-23, 2026)
**Starting Value:** 4 (Feb 18)
**Measurement Date:** Feb 23

**If timeframe halved (2.5 days):** Would increase confidence in "Doesn't change" to ~95%. Shorter windows reduce probability of unexpected news breaking and limit time for decay to accumulate beyond 3 points.

**If timeframe doubled (10 days):** Would decrease confidence in "Doesn't change" to ~85%. Longer window increases probability of: (a) unexpected news breaking, (b) court date (Feb 25) falling within window and potentially spiking interest, (c) accumulated decay exceeding 3 points from starting value.

**Current 5-day window assessment:** Moderate duration. Long enough for some movement but short enough that status quo is most likely. The key factor is that Feb 25 court date falls OUTSIDE the window by 2 days.

**(d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View:**

**Outside View Base Rates:** Increases 2%, Doesn't change 93%, Decreases 5%

**Current Circumstances Analysis:**

1. **No catalyst confirmation (strengthens "Doesn't change"):** The AskNews search returning ZERO Parker Kingston articles is powerful confirmation. In a 5-day window with no scheduled events and no current media coverage, the probability of a >3 point movement decreases further.

2. **Decay trajectory stabilization:** The slowing decay rate (15→8 lost 7 points in 3 days, but 8→4 lost only 4 points in the next 3 days) suggests approaching equilibrium. At value 4, we're essentially at baseline. Mathematical models of decay suggest minimal further movement.

3. **Floor constraint on "Decreases":** For "Decreases" to resolve, value must drop from 4 to 0 or below. This requires:
   - Falling below the 90-day mean (2.5)
   - A 100% decline from current value
   - Continued decay despite approaching natural floor
   
   While the outside view allocated 5% to this, the floor effect at current low values makes this less likely than historical average. **Adjustment: Reduce to 3%**

4. **Catalyst requirement for "Increases":** For "Increases" to resolve, value must rise from 4 to 8+. This requires:
   - A 100% increase from current value
   - New news breaking (none scheduled, none in current media)
   - Reversal of established decay trend
   
   The outside view allocated 2% based on historical upset rate. With confirmed absence of catalysts and court date outside window, this should be maintained or slightly reduced. **Adjustment: Maintain at 2% (very slight unexpected news possibility)**

5. **Status quo reinforcement:** Every piece of evidence points toward stability: no events, no current coverage, decay slowing, near baseline, court restrictions. This is an unusually strong case for status quo.

**Justification for maintaining high "Doesn't change" probability:**
The reference class (92% for ≤3 point changes) remains highly analogous. Current circumstances don't render it non-analogous; rather, they STRENGTHEN its applicability by removing potential upset sources. The 93% outside view should be increased to 95% given:
- Confirmed absence of catalysts (not just "none scheduled" but "none in current news cycle")
- Mathematical stabilization at baseline
- Structural constraints (floor effect, court restrictions)

Probability calibration:

**Inside View Prediction Development:**

Starting from outside view: Increases 2%, Doesn't change 93%, Decreases 5%

**Adjustments based on current evidence:**

1. **"Doesn't change" adjustment (+2%):** The combination of (a) zero current news coverage, (b) decay stabilization near baseline, and (c) no scheduled events is stronger than typical historical cases. The 92% base rate came from all 5-day windows; current circumstances are more stable than average. Increase to 95%.

2. **"Decreases" adjustment (-2%):** Floor effect at value 4 (near baseline 2.5) creates asymmetric constraint. Historical 2% "Decreases" rate included windows starting from higher values with more downside room. Reduce to 3%.

3. **"Increases" adjustment (0%):** Maintain at 2%. While no catalysts are scheduled, unexpected news can break. The 2% represents tail risk of: surprise legal development, unexpected media coverage, or social media viral moment despite restrictions.

**Status quo outcome check:** If nothing changes, value stays at 4 on Feb 23 = "Doesn't change" resolution. The world changes slowly; current trajectory strongly supports this.

**Calibration verification:**
- 95% = 19:1 odds for "Doesn't change" - feels appropriate given overwhelming evidence
- 3% = 33:1 odds against "Decreases" - reasonable given floor constraint
- 2% = 49:1 odds against "Increases" - appropriate for tail risk with no catalysts

**Final calibrated probabilities:**
- Increases: 2%
- Doesn't change: 95%
- Decreases: 3%

Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Feb 23 value be within 3 points of Feb 18 value (4)? Doesn't change = 1-7 range; Increases = 8+; Decreases = 0. ✓

2. **Base rate:** Outside view was 2/93/5. Inside view is 2/95/3 - rooted in base rate with justified adjustments for stronger-than-typical status quo evidence. ✓

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = Doesn't change (95%); Least likely = Increases (2%). Makes sense given no catalysts, decay stabilization, and floor effect. ✓

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Zero current news coverage (AskNews search confirmed)
   - No scheduled events until Feb 25 (after window)
   - Decay stabilizing at baseline (4 near mean 2.5)
   - Historical 92% base rate for ≤3 point changes
   - Floor effect constrains downside movement
   All factually verified. ✓

5. **Blind spot:** Unexpected legal development or media story breaks during window. Most likely on Feb 20-22 as we approach Feb 25 court date. Would spike interest toward "Increases." Probability: ~2% (already captured in forecast).

6. **Status quo:** Value staying at 4 ± 3 points is the status quo outcome. Low volatility situation with strong structural stability. 95% confidence appropriate. ✓

7. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs. ✓

Probabilities: [2, 95, 3]
