Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

**News Articles (Feb 13-14, 2026):**
- Multiple credible sources (SI.com, KSL, USA Today, BYU Athletics) report the same core facts: Parker Kingston was arrested Feb 11, 2026 on first-degree felony rape charges, expelled from BYU Feb 14, 2026, and has a court hearing scheduled for Feb 25, 2026.
- These are factual reports from established news organizations with direct quotes from court documents and university statements.
- Quality: High credibility, recent (within 5 days of forecast start), factual reporting with minimal opinion.

**Agent Report:**
- Comprehensive analysis of scheduled events between Feb 18-23, 2026
- Key finding: NO scheduled events, court appearances, games, or announcements during the forecast window
- Next court date is Feb 25, 2026 (after the window)
- Kingston is barred from social media per bail conditions
- BYU season doesn't start until Sep 5, 2026
- Quality: Thorough, logically sound, based on verifiable court records and athletics schedules

**Google Trends Data:**
- Shows massive spike on Feb 12 (value: 100) following arrest announcement
- Rapid decay: Feb 13 (45) → Feb 14 (40) → Feb 15 (15) → Feb 16 (8) → Feb 17 (6) → Feb 18 (4)
- Current value of 4 represents 96% decline from peak in just 6 days
- 90-day baseline: mean 2.5, suggesting current level (4) is still slightly elevated but approaching baseline
- Quality: Objective data showing clear decay pattern

(b) Reference class analysis:

**Reference Class 1: Post-arrest news cycles for athletes**
- Typical pattern: Massive spike on arrest day, rapid decay over 3-7 days as story becomes "old news"
- Suitability: High - Kingston's pattern matches this exactly (spike Feb 12, now decaying)
- Without new developments, interest typically stabilizes at or below baseline

**Reference Class 2: 5-day Google Trends windows (from provided data)**
- 92% of 5-day windows show change ≤3 points ("Doesn't change")
- 6% show increase >3 points
- 2% show decrease >3 points
- Suitability: Very High - This is the exact question format and uses Kingston's own historical data

**Reference Class 3: Pre-court hearing interest patterns**
- Interest often remains low in the days before a hearing, then spikes on hearing day
- Kingston's next hearing is Feb 25 (outside window)
- Suitability: Moderate - Suggests low activity during forecast period

**Selected Reference Class:** The 5-day window analysis from Kingston's own Google Trends data, supplemented by the post-arrest decay pattern.

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Forecast Period:** Feb 18-23, 2026 (5 days)
**Starting Value:** 4 (on Feb 18)
**Ending Value:** Will be measured on Feb 23

**Historical Pattern Analysis:**
- Current decay trajectory: 15→8→6→4 over Feb 15-18 (losing ~2-3 points per day initially, now slowing)
- If decay continues at current rate (~1-2 points/day), Feb 23 value would be 0-2
- This would represent a decrease of 2-4 points from starting value of 4
- A decrease of >3 points would require value to fall below 1

**Key Observation:** The value is approaching the 90-day baseline (mean: 2.5). Once at baseline, further decreases become less likely as there's a natural floor effect.

(d) Justification:

The outside view strongly suggests "Doesn't change" for several reasons:

1. **Base rate dominance:** Kingston's own historical data shows 92% of 5-day windows result in changes ≤3 points. This is the strongest predictor.

2. **Natural floor effect:** At value 4, Kingston is already near his 90-day baseline (2.5). The decay from 100→4 has already occurred. Further large movements become statistically less likely as values approach baseline.

3. **No catalysts in window:** The agent report confirms zero scheduled events, court dates, or announcements between Feb 18-23. The next court date (Feb 25) is outside the window.

4. **Decay pattern stabilizing:** The rate of decline is slowing (15→8→6→4 shows diminishing decreases). This suggests approaching equilibrium.

5. **Social media prohibition:** Kingston cannot generate new content or controversy during this period.

For "Decreases" to occur (>3 point drop), the value would need to fall from 4 to 0 or below. While possible, this requires:
- Continued decay at an accelerating rate (unlikely given current trajectory)
- Falling below the 90-day baseline mean (2.5), which acts as a natural attractor

For "Increases" to occur (>3 point rise), the value would need to reach 8+. This requires:
- A new news story or development (none scheduled)
- Reversal of the established decay trend (historically rare without catalyst)

Outside view calibration:

The 92% base rate for "Doesn't change" is compelling but requires calibration:

1. **Tethering to established distributions:** The 92/6/2 split from historical data provides a strong anchor. However, I should consider that we're in a post-spike decay phase, which might slightly alter probabilities.

2. **Floor effect consideration:** At value 4 (near baseline 2.5), the probability of a >3 point decrease is constrained by the floor. A decrease from 4 to 0 is only 4 points total, leaving little room for >3 point movement.

3. **Asymmetry in current context:** Given the decay trajectory and lack of catalysts, "Decreases" is slightly more plausible than "Increases," but both remain unlikely relative to "Doesn't change."

4. **Upset rate:** In Google Trends forecasting, upsets typically occur when unexpected news breaks. With no scheduled events and Kingston under social media restrictions, upset probability is lower than the historical 8% (6% + 2%).

5. **Probability calibration:** 
   - The 92% base rate should be maintained or slightly increased given the stabilization pattern
   - The 6% "Increases" probability should be reduced (no catalysts)
   - The 2% "Decreases" probability might be slightly increased (ongoing decay, but constrained by floor)

Final calibration: 93% "Doesn't change", 2% "Increases", 5% "Decreases"

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 2%
Doesn't change: 93%
Decreases: 5%
