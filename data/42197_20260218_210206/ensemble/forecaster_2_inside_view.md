Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary news sources (Feb 13-16, 2026):**
- Yahoo Sports, The Athletic, ESPN, NYT Athletic (Feb 13-14): Major outlets reporting Kingston's arrest on Feb 11, court appearance Feb 14, expulsion from BYU. Facts sourced from court records, police affidavits, and official statements. High reliability. Key fact: Kingston arrested Feb 11, released on bond Feb 14, next court date Feb 25.
- Sports Illustrated BYU coverage (Feb 16): Analysis of depth chart implications. Opinion-heavy but factually grounded in roster data.

**AskNews articles:**
- Multiple articles (Feb 17-18, 2026): All focus on Google I/O 2026 announcement (May 19-20) and smart glasses. **Zero relevance to Parker Kingston**. These appear to be retrieval errors based on keyword matching ("parker" from Warby Parker partnership).
- One article mentions "Parker & Company" real estate ad (Nov 2, 2025) - completely unrelated.

**Google Trends data (Feb 16, 2026):**
- Primary source showing current value of 8 (compared to 30-day window). This is factual, mechanical data.

**Critical observation:** The AskNews search returned almost entirely irrelevant results. The only relevant information comes from the initial news summaries (Feb 13-16).

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence:**
- Multiple independent sources (Yahoo, ESPN, Athletic, NYT) confirm: arrest Feb 11, court appearance Feb 14, next hearing Feb 25. This establishes the timeline definitively.
- Current Google Trends value is 8 (as of Feb 16), already declined from peak of 100 during arrest news (Feb 11-14).
- No scheduled events between Feb 18-23 (prediction window). Next catalyst is Feb 25 court hearing.

**Moderate evidence:**
- Historical pattern from outside view: 92% of 5-day windows show ≤3 point movement for this search term.
- Bail conditions prohibit Kingston from social media, reducing likelihood of self-generated news.
- Typical scandal decay pattern: sharp spike followed by rapid decline in first week.

**Weak evidence:**
- None of the AskNews articles provide relevant information about Parker Kingston or factors that would drive search interest.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window:** 5 days (Feb 18 → Feb 23, 2026)

**Current position:** We are at Feb 18, 2026. The arrest occurred Feb 11 (7 days ago), peak media coverage Feb 11-14, current value is 8 (measured Feb 16).

**Key dates:**
- Feb 18 (today): Start of prediction window
- Feb 23: End of prediction window, resolution date
- Feb 25: Next court hearing (2 days AFTER resolution)

**If timeframe halved (2.5 days):** Would increase confidence in "Doesn't change" to ~85%, as shorter windows show even less volatility.

**If timeframe doubled (10 days):** Would decrease "Doesn't change" to ~60% because it would include the Feb 25 court hearing, a known catalyst that could drive renewed interest.

**Critical insight:** The Feb 25 hearing falls OUTSIDE our prediction window. This is crucial - we're forecasting through a quiet period with no scheduled catalysts.

## (d) Justification

**Factors supporting "Doesn't change" (value stays within 3 points of Feb 18 baseline):**

1. **No scheduled catalysts:** The Feb 25 court hearing is after our window. Between Feb 18-23, there are no court dates, no new filings expected, no scheduled press conferences.

2. **Already in decay phase:** Value dropped from 100 (Feb 11-14 peak) to 8 (Feb 16). This 92% decline in 2-5 days suggests the initial news spike has exhausted itself. At value=8, we're near the noise floor.

3. **Empirical base rate:** 92% of historical 5-day windows for this term showed ≤3 point movement. Current circumstances (post-spike decay, no catalysts) are highly analogous to the reference class.

4. **Media cycle moved on:** Major outlets published Feb 13-16. No new articles in AskNews results for Feb 17-18, suggesting story has left news cycle.

**Factors supporting "Decreases" (value drops >3 points from Feb 18):**

1. **Continued decay momentum:** Post-scandal searches typically continue declining. From 8, a drop to 4 or below is plausible continuation of the decay curve.

2. **Low absolute value:** At 8, there's limited room to fall while still registering on Google Trends' 0-100 scale. However, drops to 0-2 are common for low-interest terms.

**Factors supporting "Increases" (value rises >3 points from Feb 18):**

1. **Investigative journalism:** Possible but unlikely. Major outlets already covered the story. New revelations would need to be significant and break during Feb 18-23.

2. **Social media amplification:** Kingston is banned from social media per bail conditions. Organic viral spread is possible but historically rare 7+ days post-initial news.

3. **Related events:** BYU football news, other legal developments. Very low probability in a 5-day window.

**Shift from outside view:**

The outside view base rate (92% no change, 6% increase, 2% decrease) was calibrated to 75%/7%/18% to account for general post-spike decay patterns. However, this adjustment may have been too aggressive:

- At value=8 (already very low), further decay >3 points requires dropping to ≤4, which is near the measurement floor
- The reference class (all 5-day windows for this term) already includes post-spike periods
- No new catalysts in this specific window strengthens status quo

**Recalibration:** The outside view's 92% "no change" is more appropriate than the adjusted 75%. The post-spike decay argument is valid but:
- Much of the decay has already occurred (100→8)
- At low absolute values, movements become noisier and smaller
- The 5-day window without catalysts favors stability

I should shift back toward the empirical base rate while maintaining slight elevation of "Decreases" probability due to momentum.

## Probability Calibration

**Status quo outcome:** Value remains within 3 points of Feb 18 baseline (likely 5-10 range).

**Most likely scenario:** Search interest stays in the 5-10 range through Feb 23. The story has left the news cycle, no new catalysts exist, and we're in the typical post-scandal quiet period before the next court date.

**Second most likely:** Continued gradual decay drops the value to 3-5 range by Feb 23, representing a >3 point decrease.

**Least likely:** New developments (investigative reporting, related events, viral social media) drive value above 11, representing a >3 point increase.

**Calibration considerations:**
- 90% confidence means 9:1 odds - am I willing to bet $9 to win $1 that value stays within 3 points? Given the empirical 92% base rate and lack of catalysts, yes.
- 85% confidence means 5.67:1 odds - slightly more conservative given we're 7 days post-spike and some decay momentum exists.
- Allocating 10-12% to "Decreases" acknowledges the decay momentum without overweighting it given the low absolute value.
- Allocating 3-5% to "Increases" covers low-probability surprises (investigative scoops, related news).

**Final calibration:**
- Increases: 4% (covers investigative journalism, viral resurgence, related events)
- Doesn't change: 84% (strong empirical base rate, no catalysts, analogous to reference class)
- Decreases: 12% (decay momentum, but limited room to fall from value=8)

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will Google Trends value for "parker kingston" on Feb 23 be within 3 points of Feb 18 value (no change), >3 points higher (increase), or >3 points lower (decrease)?

2. **Base rate:** Outside view established 92%/6%/2% from empirical data. My final prediction (84%/4%/12%) stays anchored to this, with modest shifts for decay momentum.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely=Doesn't change (84%); Least likely=Increases (4%). This aligns with no catalysts in window and post-spike decay phase.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - No scheduled events Feb 18-23; next court date Feb 25 (verified from multiple sources)
   - Current value=8, already declined 92% from peak (Google Trends data)
   - Empirical base rate: 92% of 5-day windows show ≤3 point movement (outside view)
   - Major media coverage ended Feb 14-16; no new articles Feb 17-18 (AskNews search)

5. **Blind spot:** Investigative journalism breaks major new angle (e.g., additional accusers, institutional cover-up allegations) during Feb 18-23, driving renewed search spike. Would shift to Increases=25%, Doesn't change=60%, Decreases=15%.

6. **Status quo:** High stability expected. Low volatility period (no catalysts), already in decay phase. Status quo (value ~5-10) is most probable outcome.

7. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [4, 84, 12]
