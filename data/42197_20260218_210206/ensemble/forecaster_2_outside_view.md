## (a) Source Analysis

**News Articles (Feb 13-14, 2026):**
- **SI.com, KSL.com, USA Today, KSL Sports** (Feb 13-14, 2026): High-quality mainstream sports journalism sources providing factual reporting on Parker Kingston's arrest, charges, and dismissal from BYU. Key facts: arrested Feb 11, charged with first-degree felony rape, dismissed from BYU Feb 14, next court date Feb 25. These are factual reports with minimal opinion content.

- **BYU Athletics page**: Official roster page providing biographical and statistical information. Factual, no opinion content.

- **EA Sports page**: Video game rating page, not relevant to news-driven search interest.

**Agent Report:**
Comprehensive analysis confirming NO scheduled events between Feb 18-23, 2026. Next court appearance is Feb 25 (outside the forecast window). Key finding: Kingston is barred from social media, dismissed from team, and no spring practices or games scheduled. The report correctly identifies that the Feb 11-14 arrest period generated the largest search spike in Kingston's history.

**Google Trends Data:**
Critical factual data showing:
- Massive spike on Feb 12 (value: 100) following arrest
- Rapid decay: Feb 13 (45) → Feb 14 (40) → Feb 15 (15) → Feb 16 (8) → Feb 17 (6) → Feb 18 (4)
- Current value at forecast start (Feb 18): 4
- Base rate: 92% of 5-day windows show ≤3 point changes

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **Post-arrest news cycles for college athletes**: Typically show rapid decay after initial spike unless new developments emerge. Most suitable given the specific context.

2. **General Google Trends decay patterns after news events**: News-driven spikes typically decay exponentially without new catalysts.

3. **5-day windows for "parker kingston" over past 90 days**: 92% show ≤3 point change, 6% increase >3, 2% decrease >3.

**Most Suitable Reference Class:** The combination of (1) post-arrest decay patterns and (3) historical 5-day window behavior for this specific search term provides the strongest foundation.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 5 days (Feb 18-23, 2026)

**Current Position in News Cycle:**
- Day 7 post-arrest (Feb 11 arrest → Feb 18 forecast start)
- Value has decayed from 100 → 4 over 6 days
- Decay rate: ~85% reduction from peak in first 2 days, then slower decline

**Historical Pattern:**
- Before Feb 11: Values consistently at 0
- Feb 12-18: Classic news-spike decay curve
- No other events in Kingston's history show sustained elevated interest beyond 5-7 days without new catalysts

**Key Observation:** The value on Feb 18 (4) is already near baseline (90-day mean: 2.5). The question asks about change from Feb 18 (4) to Feb 23.

## (d) Justification

**Factors Supporting "Doesn't Change" (≤3 point movement):**

1. **No scheduled events**: Agent report confirms zero scheduled events, hearings, or announcements in the Feb 18-23 window. Next court date is Feb 25.

2. **Natural decay floor**: At value 4, we're approaching the historical baseline (mean: 2.5). Further decay is limited by the floor effect.

3. **Base rate**: 92% of historical 5-day windows show ≤3 point changes.

4. **Media cycle exhaustion**: 7 days post-arrest, initial coverage has been published. Without new developments, media attention typically wanes.

5. **Social media ban**: Kingston cannot generate new content or controversy.

**Factors Supporting "Decreases" (>3 point drop):**

1. **Continued decay momentum**: The trend shows consistent daily decreases (6→4 over Feb 17-18).

2. **Weekend effect**: If Feb 18-23 includes a weekend, search interest for news topics often drops.

3. **To trigger "Decreases," value must drop from 4 to 0 or below** - this would represent reaching the baseline floor.

**Factors Supporting "Increases" (>3 point rise):**

1. **Unexpected news**: New legal filings, victim statements, or investigative journalism could emerge unpredictably.

2. **Media cycle timing**: Some outlets publish weekend features or weekly recap shows that could mention the case.

3. **To trigger "Increases," value must rise from 4 to 8+** - this would require a significant new catalyst.

**Critical Consideration:** The value is at 4. To "Decrease" by >3 points would require dropping to 0 or below (effectively baseline). To "Increase" by >3 points would require reaching 8+ (doubling from current level). The "Doesn't change" range is 1-7, which encompasses most plausible outcomes given no scheduled events.

Outside view calibration:

**Tethering to Established Distributions:**
- The 92% base rate for ≤3 point changes is a strong anchor
- However, we must consider we're in an unusual period (post-major news event decay phase)
- The current value (4) is close to baseline (2.5), suggesting limited downside
- The absence of scheduled catalysts strongly argues against significant increases

**Probability of Upsets:**
In Google Trends forecasting, unexpected news can create spikes, but:
- The 6% historical rate of >3 point increases provides an empirical baseline
- The specific context (legal case with known timeline, no scheduled events) reduces surprise potential
- Court filings could emerge unpredictably but are less likely mid-week before a scheduled hearing

**Calibration Adjustments:**
- Base rate suggests 92% "Doesn't change," but we're in a decay phase
- Current value (4) near floor (2.5) limits decrease potential - would need to hit 0 to trigger "Decreases"
- No catalysts visible for increases, but 6% historical rate acknowledges possibility
- The "Doesn't change" range (1-7) is wide and captures most realistic scenarios

**Final Calibration:**
Given the strong base rate (92%), absence of scheduled events, proximity to baseline floor, and typical post-news decay patterns, I weight heavily toward "Doesn't change" while acknowledging small probabilities for unexpected developments or continued decay to zero.
