Analysis:

1) Resolution/criteria paraphrase (<30 words)  
Compare Google Trends (US) “parker kingston” on 2026-02-18 vs 2026-02-23 (fixed window 2026-01-24→2026-02-23). If 2/23 is >3 higher=Increase, within ±3=No change, >3 lower=Decrease.

(a) Source analysis (quality, date, facts vs opinion)

- Yahoo Sports (Feb 14, 2026), ESPN (mid-Feb 2026), The Athletic (Feb 14, 2026):  
  High-quality mainstream sports reporting. Mostly factual: arrest date (Feb 11), rape charge, bond/conditions, dismissal/expulsion from BYU, next court date Feb 25. Limited opinion/analysis; I treat the factual timeline as reliable.

- SI / BYU Cougars On SI (Feb 16, 2026):  
  Semi-credible team/beat coverage; mixes facts (spring camp timing, roster departures) with opinion (depth-chart projections). For forecasting search interest, the key factual nugget is “spring camp later this month” (vague) and that Kingston is out.

- AskNews tech/finance articles (Feb 17–18, 2026) about Google I/O, Gemini, smart glasses, Warby Parker:  
  Generally reliable outlets (e.g., CNBC) for the I/O announcement itself, but largely irrelevant to “parker kingston” as a query. Potential weak confound only if people typo/associate “Parker” terms; however the full name “parker kingston” is strongly tied to the BYU athlete in current events.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted)

Strong evidence
- Multiple independent major sports outlets (Yahoo/ESPN/Athletic) confirm the core scandal timeline and that the “big news” already broke Feb 11–14. Mechanism: scandals spike searches, then decay absent new events.

Moderate evidence
- Known next court appearance is Feb 25 (outside window), reducing the chance of a fresh spike inside Feb 18–23.  
- Post-spike decay pattern already visible (sharp drop from peak toward low single digits). Mechanism: attention half-life is short for college-athlete legal stories unless new filings/quotes emerge.

Weak evidence (small nudges)
- Feb 23 is the alleged-incident anniversary date (Feb 23, 2025). This could cause some “one year ago” recirculation or social reposts around Feb 23, but it’s not a standard media hook unless an outlet chooses it.  
- Low-level Google Trends values can be “lumpy” (0/1/2/3/4) due to sampling and low volume; this increases tail risk for “Decreases” (dropping to 0) and, less likely, small rebounds.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Forecast window: 5 days (from 2026-02-18 to 2026-02-23).  
- If halved (~2–3 days): even more likely “Doesn’t change,” because neither decay-to-zero nor surprise-news has much time to materialize.  
- If doubled (~10 days): higher chance of “Decreases” (continued decay to 0) and also higher chance of “Increases” (some new court-related or investigative development eventually appears).

(d) Justification: updating the outside view to an inside view

Outside-view base rates given: Increases 5 / Doesn’t change 88 / Decreases 7.

Inside-view adjustments:
- I keep “Doesn’t change” as the modal outcome because (i) no scheduled catalysts in-window, (ii) the allowed “no change” band is wide (±3), and (iii) we’re already near baseline where moves often stay within that band.
- I raise “Decreases” versus the outside view: the starting level is low and could plausibly hit 0 by Feb 23 in the fixed-window scaling (a >3 drop if the Feb 18 value is ~4+). Low-volume series often print 0s, and continued attention decay is the status-quo direction.
- I raise “Increases” slightly (but keep it small): anniversary date Feb 23 plus proximity to Feb 25 hearing could prompt a minor recirculation. Still, to clear the “Increase” threshold requires a meaningful bump (e.g., from ~4 to ~8+), which usually needs genuinely new reporting.

Probability calibration
- Status quo continuation (decay + floor): points to flat-to-down, with many paths still staying within ±3.  
- Tail scenarios: (1) value prints 0 on Feb 23 → “Decreases”; (2) unexpected new detail/statement leaks, or anniversary recaps circulate → “Increases.”  
- A ±10% swing check: moving “Doesn’t change” from high-80s down into high-70s feels warranted due to low-volume lumpiness and the nontrivial chance of hitting 0 by day 5.

Checklist:
1. Options/criteria: Compared 2/18 vs 2/23 in fixed Jan24–Feb23 window; >+3 increase, within ±3 no change, <−3 decrease.  
2. Outside view base rate: [5, 88, 7].  
3. Consistency: Most likely = Doesn’t change; least likely = Increases; yes—no in-window catalyst, but some downside-to-zero risk.  
4. Key evidence (each <20 words):  
   - Arrest story peaked Feb 11–14; now decaying quickly in attention.  
   - Next court hearing Feb 25 (outside window), limiting new coverage Feb 18–23.  
   - Low values near baseline can hit 0, creating >3 drop risk.  
   - Feb 23 anniversary could cause minor recirculation (small upside risk).  
5. Blind spot: A surprise filing/statement/press conference inside Feb 18–23 could spike searches and flip to “Increases.”  
6. Status quo outcome: Continued decay toward baseline/0 suggests “Doesn’t change” or “Decreases,” not “Increases.”  
7. Technicalities: Probabilities are integers, 0–100, sum to 100.

Probabilities: [7, 78, 15]
