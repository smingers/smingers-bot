Analysis
(a) Source analysis (chronological order, all dates 2026 unless noted)

1. Yahoo Sports (14 Feb) – Factual recap of Kingston’s arrest, bond conditions, expulsion. National sports desk, high reliability for basic court facts, no forward-looking claims.  
2. The Athletic (14 Feb) – Similar hard-news coverage plus dates of next hearings (25 Feb virtual, 13 Apr preliminary). Reputable subscription outlet, high source quality.  
3. ESPN.com (c. 13 Feb) – Duplicate of the above with honor-code context; again, high reliability, no speculation.  
4. BYU-on-SI (16 Feb) – Roster-impact piece; offers no new legal events inside the 18-23 Feb window. Medium reliability, some opinion about depth-chart, low relevance to search spikes.  
5. Google Trends 30-/90-day export – Direct numeric evidence; shows 100 (12 Feb) → 4 (18 Feb) decay. Primary data source for resolution.  
6. AskNews scrape (18 Feb) – A dozen tech articles about Google I/O; none mention Parker Kingston. Noise for our question.  
Overall: all relevant sources converge on the same fact pattern (arrest last week, next legal milestone 25 Feb). No reliable source announces an event between 18 – 23 Feb.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong:  
• Historical Google-Trends decay curves: post-scandal athlete names rarely rebound before the next docket date; interest usually halves every 1-2 days then flattens.  
Moderate:  
• Court calendar (25 Feb) – gives a plausible catalyst just outside the window, reducing odds of a rebound inside the window.  
• Pre-spike baseline contained many 0’s, implying 0 is reachable; however, some days printed “1–2”, so drop-to-zero is not guaranteed.  
Weak:  
• BYU roster-impact commentary – could sustain a slow trickle of searches (1–3) but seldom drives a jump >8 without fresh news.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in 5 days (18 → 23 Feb). If the window were doubled (10 days) I would raise “Decrease” and “Increase” by ~5 pp each because both a total fade and the 25 Feb hearing would enter scope. If halved (≃2 days) “Doesn’t change” would rise about 10 pp as there would be less time for either threshold breach.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Outside-view base (last 90 d 5-day windows): Inc 6 % | NC 92 % | Dec 2 %  
Adjustments:  
• Current value is 4; “Decrease” needs exactly 0 (one integer step), historically common when baseline was 0 pre-spike → large upward revision for Dec.  
• No scheduled trigger before 23 Feb → “Increase” still possible via random national follow-ups but less likely than average spike periods → small upward tweak from 6 % to 10-12 % only.  
• Remaining probability sits with “Doesn’t change”.

Probability calibration
(a) Status-quo continuation means the curve drifts to 2–4; that sits squarely in “Doesn’t change”.  
(b) A ±10 pp swing is the difference between treating 0 as “very likely” vs “about even”. I lean to “about one-in-three”.

Checklist
1. Options: compare Google-Trends value for Parker Kingston on 18 Feb vs 23 Feb; >+3 = Increases, ±3 = No change, <−3 = Decreases.  
2. Base-rate used: 6/92/2.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = Doesn’t change; Least likely = Increases – yes, matches rationale.  
4. Key evidence (validated):  
   • Decay: 100→4 over six days (Google data).  
   • Next hearing set 25 Feb (Athletic, ESPN).  
   • Pre-spike baseline multiple 0’s (Google data).  
   • No fresh news scheduled 18-23 Feb (all sources).  
5. Blind-spot: unexpected leak (e.g., video evidence) on 20 Feb could lift value >8 – would push “Increase” to >40 %.  
6. Status-quo bias checked – kept “Doesn’t change” the modal outcome.  
7. Probabilities sum to 100 and are 0-100 integers.
