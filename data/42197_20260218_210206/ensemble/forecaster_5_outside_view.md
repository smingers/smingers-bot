Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Sports Illustrated-BYU (14 Feb 2026). Straight news story sourced to BYU statement and court records; high factual reliability, minimal opinion.  
2. KSL.com (13 Feb 2026) and KSL-Sports (13 Feb 2026). Local Utah outlets that routinely cover BYU athletics; both articles cite charging documents and on-the-record court statements; good factual quality.  
3. USA TODAY (14 Feb 2026). National paper quoting court transcripts and BYU statement; high reliability.  
4. BYU athletics bio page (evergreen). Pure background statistics; authoritative for past performance, irrelevant to near-term search interest.  
5. EA-Sports player-rating page (marketing material). Factual but not news; does not influence search interest in the five-day window.  
6. Agent report (compiled 18 Feb 2026). Synthesises court calendar, BYU schedule and media monitoring; no new facts but accurately collates open-source information.  
7. GoogleTrendsData (pulled 18 Feb 2026). Primary quantitative evidence for this question; dates and values are machine-generated and therefore objective.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes:  
i. All 5-day windows for “parker kingston” over last 90 days.  
ii. Five-day windows that immediately follow a one-day Google-Trends spike of ≥100 for a US college athlete.  
iii. Generic 5-day windows for low-volume search terms.

Class (i) is the closest match because it uses the identical term and scale, and the base-rate statistics (92 % “Doesn’t change”, 6 % “Increase”, 2 % “Decrease”) are already calculated. Class (ii) would have a higher fall-off rate but the sample size is tiny and athlete scandals differ widely. Class (iii) is too broad. I therefore adopt class (i) for the outside view.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Today is 18 Feb 2026; the outcome will be known 23 Feb 2026—five full days. Historically, 92 % of comparable five-day windows for this term have ended with the value moving ≤3 points. Importantly, the present episode sits four days after a major spike (100 on 12 Feb; now 4). Post-spike decay for similar athletes typically halves again over the next week, often reaching zero, which would be a “Decrease” (Δ ≥ 4) from our starting value of 4. There are no scheduled hearings, games, or allowed social-media posts between now and 23 Feb; the next court date is 25 Feb. Therefore the status-quo trajectory is a slow fade, not another upswing.

(d) Justification  
Status-quo outcome if nothing happens: Google Trends slides from 4 to 1–3; this resolves “Doesn’t change.”  
Path to “Decrease”: value must hit 0 (or possibly 1) on 23 Feb. That requires two more incremental drops similar to the last two days (6→4 on 17–18 Feb). Given the term’s historic pattern—often bottoming out at zero once general-interest coverage subsides—this is plausible.  
Path to “Increase”: value must rebound to ≥8. Absent any scheduled catalyst inside the window, that would require an unscheduled development: leaked evidence, sensational new article, viral social-media thread, or national-TV segment. Kingston is barred from social media, and most outlets will likely wait until the 25 Feb hearing for fresh material. Such unscheduled surges occur, but the base rate (6 %) and lack of forthcoming events keep the probability low.

Outside view calibration:

• Base-rate anchor (“Doesn’t change” 92 %, “Increase” 6 %, “Decrease” 2 %).  
• Adjust down “Doesn’t change” because the current value (4) is perched just three points above a zero floor; empirical decay after scandals suggests a heavier left tail than usual. I transfer 10 percentage points from “Doesn’t change” to “Decrease.”  
• Adjust “Increase” slightly downward (-2 pts) because no catalyst is scheduled.  
Adjusted distribution: Increases 4 %, Doesn’t change 80 %, Decreases 16 %.  
• Finally, add a small tail for surprise media burst (+3 pts to “Increase”), funded by a 2-pt cut to “Doesn’t change” and 1-pt cut to “Decrease.”

Resulting calibrated probabilities: Increases 7 %, Doesn’t change 78 %, Decreases 15 %. The odds ratio (≈11 : 3 : 2) reflects heavy inertia but acknowledges a meaningful chance the term drifts all the way to zero by 23 Feb.

Outside View Prediction:
['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']  
Increases: 7%  
Doesn't change: 78%  
Decreases: 15%
