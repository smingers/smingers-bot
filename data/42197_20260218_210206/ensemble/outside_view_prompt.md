You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “parker kingston” change between 2026-02-18 and 2026-02-23 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “parker kingston” at the time of writing this question (Feb 16, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 8; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=parker%20kingston&date=2026-01-17%202026-02-16).

`{"format":"trends_interest_change_magnitude","info":{"topic":"parker kingston","trend_start":"2026-02-18","trend_end":"2026-02-23","verification_url":"https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=parker%20kingston&date=2026-01-24%202026-02-23"}}`

The options are: ['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question resolves “Doesn't change” if the value on the timeline at [https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=parker%20kingston&date=2026-01-24%202026-02-23](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=parker%20kingston&date=2026-01-24%202026-02-23) for 2026-02-23 is within 3 of the value at 2026-02-18. It resolves “Increases” if the value is more than 3 greater, and resolves “Decreases” if the value is more than 3 lower.

<Agent_report>
Query: List any scheduled events, announcements, games, interviews, legal issues, or viral social-media posts involving BYU football player Parker Kingston expected between 18–23 Feb 2026; include context of past spikes in his search interest.
Overview  
The only developments concerning BYU wide-receiver Parker Kingston that have firm, published dates falling between 18 Feb 2026 and 23 Feb 2026 are legal-process deadlines imposed by the court. No games, team interviews, NIL appearances, publicity events or scheduled media opportunities involving Kingston are on record for that six-day period, and BYU’s 2026 football schedule does not begin until 5 Sep 2026. The university has already dismissed Kingston from the program and stated that he is no longer a student, further reducing the likelihood of any athletics-related activity in the near term.  

1.  Legal calendar (drives anticipated search interest)  
• Kingston’s next court appearance is set for Wednesday 25 Feb 2026 at 10:30 a.m. MT in Utah’s Fifth Judicial District Court. (WGXA, 13 Feb 2026)  
• Conditions of release require him to wear a GPS ankle monitor, avoid social media, and have no contact with the accuser or witnesses. (Fox Sports, 14 Feb 2026; WGXA, 13 Feb 2026)  
• Because the appearance is scheduled for 25 Feb—two days after the forecast window—there are no additional hearings, filings, or deadlines specified for 18–23 Feb. Court dockets are public in Utah, and no interim motions or hearings have been noticed as of the latest reporting.  

2.  Planned athletics activities  
• BYU’s 2026 season opener is 5 Sep 2026 against Utah Tech; the full 2026 schedule lists no events before that date. (BYU Athletics release, 21 Jan 2026; Big 12 master schedule)  
• Spring-practice dates for BYU football have not been announced, but Kingston’s dismissal from the team (SI-BYU, 14 Feb 2026) ends any possibility that he would participate or be interviewed.  
• There are therefore zero games, scrimmages, or team-media availabilities featuring Kingston in the 18–23 Feb window.  

3.  University and athletics-department statements  
• BYU issued its initial statement acknowledging the arrest on 12 Feb 2026 (USA Today, 11 Feb 2026; NY Post, 13 Feb 2026).  
• A follow-up on 14 Feb 2026 confirmed Kingston is “no longer a student and no longer a member of the football team.” (SI-BYU, 14 Feb 2026; ABC News, 14 Feb 2026)  
• No further institutional announcements are scheduled or hinted at for 18–23 Feb. Any additional comment is unlikely before the 25 Feb court date, because the university cited privacy laws and an ongoing legal process.  

4.  Kingston’s own public platform  
• The bail order explicitly bars him from using social-media platforms while the case is pending. (Fox Sports, 14 Feb 2026; WGXA, 13 Feb 2026)  
• Consequently, no live-streamed statements, TikTok videos, or other influencer-style content should emerge in the forecast period.  

5.  Media coverage outlook  
Although no events are scheduled, rolling news coverage can still create search-interest spikes when:  
a) Additional investigative details are released (e.g., the affidavit unsealed on 12 Feb 2026—Yahoo Sports, 12 Feb 2026; The Athletic, 13 Feb 2026).  
b) National outlets publish feature stories or opinion pieces on BYU’s disciplinary policies.  
Neither type of coverage is pre-scheduled, but both are plausible between 18 and 23 Feb because (i) reporters may file deeper dives during the lull before the 25 Feb hearing and (ii) sports-talk programs often revisit high-profile arrests in weekly cycles. Still, such pieces are speculative; no journalist has published a forthcoming-article date.  

6.  Context of previous spikes in Google-search interest for “parker kingston”  
A review of news coverage (aligned with historical Google Trends peaks) shows four clear catalysts:  
• 28 Dec 2024 – Punt-return TD vs. Colorado in the Alamo Bowl led highlight shows. (image caption in WGXA photo)  
• 12 Oct 2025 – Breakout 117-yard game and late TD vs. Arizona drew Big 12 attention (BYU schedule recap).  
• 27 Dec 2025 – Pop-Tarts Bowl performance against Georgia Tech put him on national radar (WGXA photo caption).  
• 11–14 Feb 2026 – Arrest, charging documents, and removal from BYU generated the largest spike to date. (Wide multi-source coverage above)  
These historic bursts suggest that the current legal matter is already the dominant driver of search volume, and any additional uptick before 23 Feb would probably hinge on a new legal filing or a high-visibility news package, not sporting activity.  

7.  Summary for 18 Feb – 23 Feb 2026  
Events/announcements definitively scheduled:  
• NONE.  
Legal status during window:  
• Out on bail under strict conditions; next hearing 25 Feb 2026 (outside window).  
Team-related activity:  
• NONE; Kingston dismissed from BYU roster 14 Feb 2026.  
Media or social media appearances:  
• Prohibited from social media; no announced interviews.  
Implication for Google Trends forecast:  
• With no time-stamped events inside the window, the most likely scenario is a stabilization of search interest at post-arrest levels until coverage ramps up again on or just before 25 Feb.  

Remaining information gaps  
• Utah court docket could still add filings (e.g., motions) that would become public and newsworthy during the window, but no such filings are presently scheduled.  
• BYU has not published spring-practice dates; if they are announced and include statements about roster changes, Kingston could be referenced indirectly.  
Both gaps would require monitoring of the Utah Court Xchange system and BYU athletics press releases, respectively; as of the latest available reporting, neither source lists activity for 18–23 Feb 2026.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
