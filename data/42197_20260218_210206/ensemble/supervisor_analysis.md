Disagreement Analysis:

**Disagreement 1: Probability of "Decreases" — How likely is the value to drop to 0 (or near 0) by Feb 23?**
- Forecasters 1 (3%), 2 (12%) vs. Forecasters 4 (30%), 5 (25%), 3 (15%)
- The core dispute is whether the current Google Trends value (~4-8) will decay to 0 within 5 days. Forecasters 4 and 5 argue that pre-spike baseline had multiple 0s, so returning to 0 is quite plausible (~30-35% historical chance), which would trigger "Decreases." Forecasters 1 and 2 argue the value is already near the floor and there's limited room to fall more than 3 points, keeping "Decreases" low.
- This is the largest source of disagreement, responsible for the spread between 57% and 95% on "Doesn't change."

**Disagreement 2: What will the Feb 18 starting value actually be in the rescaled window (Jan 24–Feb 23)?**
- Forecaster 1 assumes ~4; Forecaster 2 notes current value is 8 (from the Jan 17–Feb 16 window); Forecasters 4 and 5 suggest 4-8 depending on rescaling.
- This matters enormously: if the starting value is 8, then "Decreases" requires dropping to ≤4 (plausible); if the starting value is 4, "Decreases" requires dropping to 0 (harder but still possible). The rescaling effect of the different date window is a factual question.

**Disagreement 3: Probability of "Increases" — Is there a realistic catalyst before Feb 23?**
- All forecasters agree this is the least likely outcome, but range from 2% (Forecaster 1) to 13% (Forecaster 4).
- Forecasters 4 and 5 give more weight to pre-hearing media coverage or surprise leaks; Forecaster 1 sees essentially no pathway. This is a moderate disagreement.

Root Causes:

1. **Decreases probability**: Partly factual (what was the pre-spike baseline in Google Trends? How often do low-value terms print 0?), partly different weighting of the same "floor effect" evidence. Forecasters 4/5 treat the historical 0s as strong evidence of return-to-zero; Forecasters 1/2 treat the current low value as already at floor.

2. **Starting value on Feb 18**: Factual — depends on how Google Trends rescales values when the window shifts from Jan 17–Feb 16 to Jan 24–Feb 23. The peak (Feb 11-14) stays in both windows, so the relative scaling shouldn't change dramatically, but the exact Feb 18 value in the resolution window is verifiable.

3. **Increases probability**: Primarily judgment-based (how likely is a surprise news event?), though partly factual (is there any scheduled event, press conference, or filing between Feb 18-23?).
