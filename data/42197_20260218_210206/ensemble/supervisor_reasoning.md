Resolution of Disagreements:

**Disagreement 1 (Probability of "Decreases" - the largest disagreement):**
The research partially clarifies this but does not fully resolve it. Key findings:
- The arrest occurred Feb 11, 2026, with peak media coverage Feb 11-14.
- By Feb 16, the value in the Jan 17–Feb 16 window was already 8 (given in the question).
- The agent research confirmed we cannot obtain the exact Feb 18 value in the resolution window (Jan 24–Feb 23). However, the qualitative trajectory is clear: massive spike Feb 11-14, rapid decay afterward.
- The alleged incident date was Feb 23, 2025 — exactly one year before the end of the resolution window. This is a notable coincidence that could generate some "anniversary" coverage, though this is speculative.
- Pre-spike baseline likely had many 0s (this was asserted by forecasters 4/5 and is consistent with "parker kingston" being an obscure search term before the arrest).

The evidence supports the view that the starting value on Feb 18 will be low (likely 2-8 in the rescaled window), and that returning to 0 is plausible given the pre-spike baseline was essentially 0. Forecasters 4 and 5's argument that "Decreases" has meaningful probability (25-30%) has some merit, but forecasters 1 and 2's point about floor effects also has validity — when values are already very low, the ±3 threshold becomes harder to breach downward.

**Disagreement 2 (Starting value on Feb 18):**
Not resolved. The agent research confirmed the exact value cannot be determined from news articles. The question states the Feb 16 value was 8 in a slightly different window. In the resolution window (Jan 24–Feb 23), the peak is still included, so rescaling effects should be modest. The Feb 18 value is likely in the 3-6 range given continued decay from 8 on Feb 16. If it's ~4-5, "Decreases" requires reaching 0-1, which is possible but not certain.

**Disagreement 3 (Probability of "Increases"):**
The research reveals that the next court date is Feb 25 (confirmed by multiple sources), and there's a social media gag order on Kingston. No new news articles were found for Feb 17-18 specifically about Kingston. The Feb 23 anniversary of the alleged incident is a minor potential catalyst. The evidence slightly favors the lower estimates (2-7%) for "Increases" — no scheduled events in the window, gag order prevents Kingston-driven news, and media attention has clearly moved on.

Updated Analysis:

The key question remains: how likely is the Google Trends value to drop from ~4-6 on Feb 18 to 0-1 on Feb 23? 

Arguments for higher "Decreases" probability (~20-25%):
- Pre-spike baseline was essentially 0
- No catalysts to sustain interest
- Media coverage ended by Feb 14-16
- Low-volume search terms frequently print 0

Arguments for lower "Decreases" probability (~5-10%):
- Some residual interest typically persists for weeks after major news events
- The Feb 25 court date may generate some anticipatory searches
- The anniversary (Feb 23, 2025 incident date) could generate minor interest
- Values of 2-3 would still be "Doesn't change" if starting from 4-5

I think the truth lies between the extremes. The weighted average of 17% for "Decreases" seems reasonable but perhaps slightly high. The "Doesn't change" at 75.8% seems slightly low — I'd nudge it up modestly. The "Increases" at 7.2% seems slightly high given the confirmed lack of catalysts and gag order — I'd nudge it down slightly.

My adjusted estimate: Increases ~6%, Doesn't change ~79%, Decreases ~15%.

Confidence: LOW

The research did not resolve the core factual question (exact Google Trends values on Feb 18 in the resolution window), and the disagreements remain largely judgment-based. The adjustments from the weighted average are minor.

Probabilities: [6, 79, 15]
