# Summary of Article: "Who will step up in Richie Saunders' absence?"

**Source:** Deseret News  
**Date:** February 18, 2026

## Key Facts and Events:

1. **Richie Saunders injury:** BYU basketball senior leader Richie Saunders suffered a season-ending knee injury (ACL tear) during an overtime win against Colorado at the Marriott Center. At the time of injury, he was averaging 18.8 points, 6.0 rebounds, and 1.8 steals per game.

2. **Parker Kingston arrest:** BYU football's best receiver Parker Kingston was arrested on a felony rape charge. He has been removed from the roster and is no longer a student at BYU.

3. **Death of Patti Edwards:** Patti Edwards, 93-year-old widow of legendary BYU football coach LaVell Edwards, passed away.

4. **BYU roster injuries:** Six of 17 rostered basketball players are out for the season: Richie Saunders, Dawson Baker, Nate Pickens, KJ Perry, Brody Kozlowski, and Xavion Staton.

5. **Upcoming schedule:** BYU plays No. 4 Arizona in Tucson on Wednesday (February 18, 2026 context), with the Big 12 tournament and NCAA Tournament Selection Sunday approaching.

## Expert Opinions (Named Sources):

**Jackson Payne:** Suggests BYU can't replace Saunders individually but might replace his production in aggregate. Expects AJ Dybantsa and Rob Wright III to shoulder heavier workloads, with reserves Mihailo Boskovic, Tyler Mrus, and Aleksej Kostic providing more scoring. Notes that Khadim Mboup needs to continue solid defense/rebounding, and big men Keba Keita and Abdullah Ahmed need to improve.

**Dick Harmon:** States losing Saunders is "not a fixable issue" for coach Kevin Young. Presents a theory that the "Big Three focus" with isolation plays may have diminished other players' roles, potentially leading to lack of focus. Suggests the injury might trigger improved performance from Kennard Davis Jr., Tyler Mrus, Aleksej Kostic, and Mihailo Boskovic if it inspires the team to come together.

## Reader Comments (Less Reliable Sources):

- One commenter predicts BYU would finish 4-2 with Saunders, but 2-4 is likely without him (3-3 is "wishful thinking")
- Another commenter emphasizes Saunders' tenacity and effort will be most missed, hoping players learn from his example about effort-based defense

Query: What is the current Google Trends interest value for "parker kingston" on February 18, 2026, when viewed in the resolution window of January 24 to February 23, 2026? Also, what were the daily values in the days leading up to February 18 — specifically from February 14-17 — in that same window?
The question asks for the exact Google Trends “interest over time” numbers (0 – 100 scale) for the search term “parker kingston” on the following dates, with the Google Trends date-window locked at 24 Jan 2026 – 23 Feb 2026:

• 18 Feb 2026 (the “current” value)
• 14 Feb, 15 Feb, 16 Feb and 17 Feb 2026 (the four prior days)

Those numbers are not contained in any of the material surfaced so far.  

1. All newly returned documents are conventional news stories that chronicle the timeline of BYU wide-receiver Parker Kingston’s arrest (12 Feb 2026) and subsequent court-appearance/bail hearing (13 Feb 2026), plus follow-up coverage through 17–18 Feb 2026 (KSL TV, Economic Times, ESPN, Deseret News). These articles confirm a burst of media attention in exactly the period of interest, reinforcing the expectation that Google search activity—and therefore Google Trends values—spiked in mid-February (KSLTV.com, 13 Feb 2026; ESPN.com, 5 days before 18 Feb 2026; Deseret News, 18 Feb 2026).  
2. None of the retrieved pages contains the Google Trends dataset or even screenshots of the Trends graph; they only provide narrative descriptions of the arrest and its aftermath.  
3. Likewise, the technical overviews about scraping Google Trends data (ScrapingBee blog, 2026) explain how one might obtain the data programmatically, but they do not include the numeric daily values for “parker kingston” in the specified window.  

Therefore:

• The numeric “interest over time” value for 18 Feb 2026 within the 24 Jan – 23 Feb window remains unknown.  
• The daily values for 14 Feb, 15 Feb, 16 Feb and 17 Feb 2026 are also still unknown.  
• Because those numbers are missing, the companion forecasting question—whether the value on 23 Feb differs from the value on 18 Feb by more than three points—cannot yet be resolved either.  

What the evidence does show is qualitative support for a February search-interest spike, consistent with the earlier observation that the ranking for 16 Feb 2026 in a similar 30-day window was “8” on Google Trends (prior analysis). But qualitative evidence is insufficient; the exact 0-to-100 figures must be read directly off the Google Trends interface (or its API) with the date-range hard-coded in the URL. Those data points are not published in ordinary news coverage and do not appear in any indexed webpage returned by the searches above.

Information still needed
• Exact Google Trends “interest over time” values for 14 Feb – 18 Feb 2026 (and ideally for 23 Feb 2026) with the window fixed at 2026-01-24 → 2026-02-23.  
• Once those figures are obtained, the forecasting question about increase/decrease/no-change between 18 Feb and 23 Feb can be answered definitively.

At present, no publicly available web page supplies those numeric daily values; they must be extracted directly from Google Trends.</Agent_report>
