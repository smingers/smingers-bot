Analysis:
To gauge whether Google search interest in “parker kingston” will rise, fall, or stay flat over the next five days, the key is to learn if anything news-worthy is expected to happen to, or be announced about, the person most people search for with that name—almost certainly BYU wide-receiver Parker Kingston.  Useful signals include:
• Breaking or scheduled sports news (injury updates, spring-practice reports, transfers, awards watch-lists).
• Viral social-media moments or NIL/endorsement deals.
• Legal or personal-life stories that could draw broader attention.
It is therefore necessary to scan the open Web for hints of upcoming events, and dedicated news verticals for the freshest articles.  A broader natural-language AskNews query can sweep in very recent or local coverage that may not yet be indexed by Google News.
