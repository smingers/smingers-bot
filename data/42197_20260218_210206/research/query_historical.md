Analysis:
The key is whether something between 18 – 23 Feb 2026 is likely to push search volume for “parker kingston” (a BYU Cougars wide-receiver who briefly trended after a 2023 highlight) sharply up or down.  Unless an injury, transfer-portal move, award, arrest, viral TikTok, major LDS-related story, or a scheduled public appearance occurs, search interest should stay flat and low.  Useful historical context therefore includes:  
• Past spikes in Google Trends and what news or social-media events caused them (to gauge how big a catalyst is needed for a >3-point move).  
• Any planned BYU football announcements, spring-practice dates, pro-day schedules, or media features in the Feb 18-23 window.  
• Recent or forthcoming news articles, team press releases, or social-media chatter specifically mentioning Parker Kingston this week.  
These items can be found with a general web search, a news-only search, and a deeper agent query.  Because the variable of interest is Google Trends itself, we also add a Google Trends lookup to view the baseline volatility over the last 90 days.
