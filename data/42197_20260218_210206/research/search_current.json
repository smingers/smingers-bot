He is no longer part of the 2026 picture.\n\n2. **Impact on Depth Chart:** With Kingston's departure, BYU must replace their top three pass-catchers from the 2025 season.\n\n3. **Spring Camp Timing:** BYU will kick off Spring Camp later this month (February 2026).\n\n## Current Roster Analysis:\n\n**Most Experienced Returning Player:**\n- **Jojo Phillips** becomes the most experienced wide receiver on the roster with 25 catches for 377 yards in his career. The article notes he has physical ability but has been limited by injuries and drops.\n\n**Other Returning Players:**\n- **Cody Hagen** didn't receive many targets in 2025 but played significant snaps. He was 16 months removed from mission service at the start of the 2025 season and was a highly productive recruit from Utah.\n\n**Statistical Context:**\n- BYU wide receivers had only 13 contested catches in 2025, with 9 coming from Chase Roberts (who is presumably no longer on the roster).\n\n**New Additions:**\n- **Kyler Kasper** (Oregon transfer) is highlighted as someone who can make contested catches, which is identified as a deficiency in the returning receivers. Aaron Roderick is quoted as \"expecting big things\" from Kasper.\n- Four true freshmen wide receivers are joining: **Jaron Pula**, **Terrance Saryon**, **Legend Glasker**, and one unnamed. Three of them (Pula, Saryon, and Glasker) turned down multiple Power Four offers to attend BYU.\n- Pula is specifically mentioned as potentially cracking the rotation soon due to being physically ready for P4 football.\n\n**Other Scholarship Players:**\n- **Tiger Bachmeier** (transferred from Stanford before 2025 season, older brother of QB Bear Bachmeier) had 7 catches for 59 yards in 2025 and 409 yards at Stanford in 2023.\n- **Reggie Frischknecht** and **Tei Nacua** had limited playing time in 2025.\n\n## Context/Opinions:\n\nThe article projects that Phillips and Hagen are the most likely candidates to start, with rotation spots and one additional starting position up for grabs. The author believes Kasper could start immediately if healthy due to his contested catch ability.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://sports.yahoo.com/college-football/article/byu-star-receiver-parker-kingston-no-longer-at-school-after-being-arrested-on-rape-charge-014228558.html\">\n# Summary of Article: BYU star receiver Parker Kingston no longer at school after being arrested on rape charge\n\n**Source:** Yahoo Sports  \n**Date:** February 14, 2026  \n**Author:** Jack Baer\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n- **Parker Kingston** is no longer enrolled at BYU following his arrest on a first-degree felony rape charge\n- The charge stems from an incident on **February 23, 2025** in St. George, Utah\n- A 20-year-old woman reported the alleged sexual assault to officers at Utah's St. George Regional Hospital\n- Kingston made a court appearance on **Friday** (February 13, 2026) and was released on **$100,000 bond** with $10,000 cash paid immediately\n- He was initially held without bail\n- Kingston is **21 years old**\n- If convicted, he faces **five years to life in prison**\n- His next court appearance is scheduled for **February 25**\n\n## Court Conditions:\n- Must wear a GPS ankle monitor\n- Cannot contact his accuser or potential witnesses\n- Must remain off social media\n- Cannot return to southwestern Utah county except for court appearances\n\n## Athletic Performance (Last Season):\n- Led BYU receivers with **67 catches**\n- **928 receiving yards**\n- **5 receiving touchdowns**\n- **119 rushing yards** and **3 rushing touchdowns**\n- Earned **first-team All-Big 12 honors**\n\n## Statements:\n- **Judge John Walton:** \"I found by clear and convincing evidence that Mr. Kingston was a danger to the community\"\n- **BYU statement:** Acknowledged awareness of the arrest, stated they take allegations seriously and will cooperate with law enforcement, cited privacy laws preventing additional comment\n- BYU spokesperson declined to clarify whether Kingston left voluntarily or was expelled\n\n## Additional Context:\n- Kingston appeared to announce his engagement at a BYU men's basketball game on Saturday (February 8, 2026), four days before his arrest\n</Summary>\n\n<Asknews_articles>\nQuery: Will the interest in \u201cparker kingston\u201d change between 2026-02-18 and 2026-02-23 according to Google Trends?\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Google I/O 2026 Set for May 19\u201320, AI Glasses and Gemini Updates Expected**\nGoogle has officially announced that its annual developer conference, Google I/O, will take place from May 19 to 20, 2026, at its headquarters in Mountain View, California, with live streaming available globally.

While AI agents are expected to grow in use for both consumers and businesses, issues like inconsistent outputs, poor system interoperability, and concerns over data privacy and environmental impact persist. Salesforce is reducing reliance on large language models due to their probabilistic nature, favoring more deterministic automation. Despite these hurdles, companies are investing in AI to improve efficiency amid rising costs and volatile markets. The AI bubble remains a concern, with Deutsche Bank identifying it as the top risk to market stability in 2026, potentially affecting luxury spending in the US. Consumer backlash against generative AI is growing due to ethical concerns over training data, job displacement, and environmental costs, with political campaigns in the US increasingly targeting AI. Fashion brands are responding with mixed strategies\u2014some distancing themselves from AI (e.g., Aerie\u2019s pledge not to use AI-generated bodies), while others use AI for marketing (e.g., Equinox\u2019s AI satire campaign). Meanwhile, social media regulation is intensifying, with Australia banning youth access and European countries considering similar laws; US lawsuits allege platforms are designed to be addictive, with major cases set to begin in January 2026. Other emerging trends include smart glasses from Google and Warby Parker, the rise of world models in AI, and AI\u2019s expanding role in fashion jobs like marketing and content creation. The tech industry is also advancing foundational protocols\u2014such as OpenAI\u2019s agentic commerce protocol and the Linux Foundation\u2019s Agentic AI Foundation\u2014to standardize agent communication and collaboration.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 07, 2026 04:00 PM\nSource:[The Business of Fashion](https://www.businessoffashion.com/briefings/technology/tech-mode-the-tech-trends-that-will-change-fashion-in-2026/)\n\n**Has the Boxing Day bounce come early for estate agents?**\nStrutt & Parker has reported a 173% increase in the number of properties launched to the market between November 26 and December 5, 2025\u2014following the Autumn Budget\u2014compared to the same period in 2024. This surge, described as a 'post-Budget boost' rather than a traditional Boxing Day bounce, is attributed to improved market clarity after a delayed Budget and heightened political uncertainty. Claire Reynolds, UK Head of Sales at Strutt & Parker, noted that the policies announced did not deter vendors, signaling renewed confidence. The total value of homes launched during this 10-day period was nearly three times higher than in the same period in 2024. The average property value launched outside London was \u00a31.2m, while in prime central London it exceeded \u00a34m\u2014both above the 2024 levels. Matt Henderson, residential research lead, emphasized that recent economic and political turbulence has eroded seasonal market patterns, but with interest rates expected to fall and the Budget now behind them, many buyers and sellers are adopting an 'act now' approach. The data suggests positive momentum for the housing market in 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 10, 2025 12:07 AM\nSource:[Estate Agent Today](https://www.estateagenttoday.co.uk/breaking-news/2025/12/has-the-boxing-day-bounce-come-early-for-estate-agents/)\n\n**Google's 2025 Year in Search offers a look inside America's mind**\nGoogle's 2025 Year in Search report reveals insights into the most searched topics in the United States, based on global search data.

Despite a seemingly 'doom and gloom' backdrop\u2014evidenced by a month-long U.S. government shutdown, Middle East instability, a WHO mental health report, and a high-profile museum heist\u2014consumers are turning to connection as a source of resilience. In 2026, this connection will manifest in unexpected ways: 20% of Gen Z and Gen Alpha consumers are predicted to use AI companions, drawn to their always-on, private, and non-judgmental nature, though this trend raises serious concerns about mental health and privacy. Simultaneously, a third of consumers will prioritize offline brand experiences over digital ones, with in-person shopping rising\u2014evidenced by a seven-point increase in intent during the 2025 winter holiday season\u2014and brands like Starbucks and TikTok investing in real-life engagement. Additionally, AI glasses are expected to launch the AI wearables race, with 10% of consumers trialing them in 2026, driven by innovations from Meta, Google (in partnership with Warby Parker and Gentle Monster), Alibaba\u2019s Quark, and Amazon\u2019s planned release in late 2026 or early 2027. These trends reflect a shift toward hybrid connection\u2014balancing digital convenience with human and physical presence. Forrester urges businesses to adapt through its Predictions 2026 guide and client sessions.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 31, 2025 01:59 PM\nSource:[Forrester](https://www.forrester.com/blogs/predictions-2026-consumers-find-connection-in-unexpected-places/)\n\n**Retail peak season: Your 2025/26 marketing must-do list is here**\nSouth African shoppers are increasingly relying on research, with search interest for 'reviews' rising 30% across retail categories and 40% specifically in apparel during last year's peak season, according to Ricky Hendricks, Google South Africa's industry manager for retail. He notes that 75% of shoppers use three or more channels for both research and shopping, highlighting the importance of omnichannel strategies. Makro, a grocery and electronics retailer, leveraged Local Inventory Ads\u2014showing real-time stock availability on Google at nearby stores\u2014to achieve a 10% higher online conversion rate and a 15% increase in gross merchandise value. For the 2025\u20132026 peak season, retailers are advised to adopt a holistic marketing calendar from October to January. In October, build anticipation and loyalty via VIP email and WhatsApp databases with early Black Friday access. In November, cross-promote Christmas and Black Friday with targeted discounts and urgency-driven ads to grow the database and capture early sales. During Black Friday weekend, use Performance Max campaigns to drive high-volume sales and clear stock, while sending post-purchase vouchers valid until 25 December to boost further Christmas sales. In December and January, shift to emotional, full-funnel campaigns centered on family, food, and holiday cheer, while bidding on New Year\u2019s resolution keywords like 'fitness tracker' and 'home storage ideas'. VIP members receive early access to New Year\u2019s bundles from 26 December to 1 January. Finally, throughout January, target three audiences\u2014fitness and health enthusiasts, home improvement fans, and parents shopping for back-to-school\u2014with themed campaigns. This phased approach extends customer lifetime value and positions brands as the go-to provider for the entire season.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 12:00 AM\nSource:[Think with Google](https://www.thinkwithgoogle.com/intl/en-emea/marketing-strategies/search/black-friday-retail-peak-season-strategy-2025-2026/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
