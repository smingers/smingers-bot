He was charged with first-degree felony rape for an alleged incident that occurred in February 2025.\n\n3. **Timeline:** The incident occurred in February 2025, and the arrest was made almost a year later in February 2026 (specifically Wednesday, February 11, 2026). The arrest came after a nearly year-long investigation by the Washington County Attorney's Office.\n\n4. **University Awareness:** BYU clarified that university administration and Head Coach Kalani Sitake were only made aware of the investigation and allegations after Kingston's arrest on February 11, 2026.\n\n5. **Court Appearance:** Kingston had his first court appearance on Friday (February 14, 2026).\n\n6. **Athletic Performance Statistics:**\n   - Joined BYU football program in 2022\n   - 403 receiving yards from 2022-2024\n   - In 2024 (breakout season): 928 receiving yards on 67 catches, led the Cougars in receiving\n   - Also had 119 rushing yards and 3 rushing touchdowns in 2024\n   - Three punt returns for touchdowns over the last two seasons\n   - Was scheduled to be BYU's top wide receiver in 2026\n\n7. **Comparison to Previous Case:** The article contrasts Kingston's situation with that of former BYU quarterback Jake Retzlaff, who was named in a civil lawsuit (not criminal charges) alleging sexual assault one year prior. Retzlaff's case was dropped when parties agreed to dismiss with prejudice, though he admitted to breaking the school's honor code and received a seven-game suspension before withdrawing and transferring to Tulane.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://byucougars.com/sports/football/roster/player/parker-kingston\">\n# Summary of Article: Parker Kingston - Football 2022\n\n**Source:** BYU Athletics - Official Athletics Website\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Career Achievements:**\n- Only player in BYU history with a passing TD, rushing TD, receiving TD, and punt return TD in their career\n- One of only two active FBS players (along with Nick Nash, WR, San Jose State) with multiple career games featuring both a passing and receiving touchdown\n- Third player in Big 12 history to have multiple career games with a passing and receiving touchdown (after Kenny Hill, TCU, 2017; Kerry Meier, Kansas, 2007-08)\n\n**Recent Recognition:**\n- Named Big 12 Special Teams Player of the Week following a 90-yard punt return for touchdown in BYU's 38-9 win over No. 13 Kansas State on Sept. 21\n- Named to Paul Hornung Award Watch List (2024, 2025)\n\n**High School Career (Roy High School):**\n- Three-year varsity starter\n- Career totals: 187 of 314 passing for 2,649 yards and 24 TDs; 232 rushing carries for 2,136 yards and 33 TDs; 34 receptions for 542 yards and 5 TDs; 5 kick returns for 256 yards and 2 TDs; 5 punt returns for 91 yards\n- 2021 season as quarterback: 77 of 131 (59%) passing for 1,088 yards, 10 TDs and 5 interceptions; 124 carries for 1,129 yards and 18 TDs\n- Seven 100-yard rushing games in 2021, including three games with three touchdowns\n- 2,217 yards of total offense as quarterback in 2021\n- 2019 season as wide receiver: 34 receptions for 542 yards and 5 TDs\n- Returned two kickoffs for touchdowns in 2021\n- Averaged 51 yards per kickoff return and 18 yards per punt return in 2021\n- Won state title in 100 meters with 10.53 time as a senior\n- Led 6A in rushing touchdowns with 18 in 2021; No. 3 in 6A with 15 rushing touchdowns in 2020\n- Rated three-star recruit by 247 Sports\n\n**Personal Information:**\n- Parents: Trent and Shannon\n- Major: Business\n- Grandmother ran track at BYU\n- Enjoys golfing\n- High school teammates with current BYU nose tackle Justin Kirkland\n- Coached by Fred Fernandes at Roy High School\n- Also recruited by Air Force, Utah, and Fresno State\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/ratings/player-ratings/parker-kingston/1647\">\n# Summary of Article\n\n**Source:** EA Sports\n\n**Content Type:** Video game player rating page\n\n**Key Information:**\n\n1. **Subject:** Parker Kingston - a college football player featured in EA SPORTS\u2122 College Football 26 video game\n\n2. **Player Details:**\n   - Position: Wide Receiver (WR)\n   - Team: BYU\n   - Height: 5'11\" (180 cm)\n   - Jersey Number: 11\n   - Year: Junior\n   - Hometown: Layton, Utah\n   - Previous School: Redshirt Status mentioned but not specified\n\n3. **Game Rating:**\n   - Overall Rating (OVR): 90 in EA SPORTS\u2122 College Football 26\n   - Context: National Championship edition/version\n\n4. **Additional Context:**\n   - The page promotes a \"Playoff Bundle\" that includes both Madden NFL 26 Standard Edition and EA SPORTS\u2122 College Football 26 Standard Edition\n\n**Note:** This article is a video game player profile page and does not contain news, analysis, or information about real-world events that might directly explain changes in Google Trends search interest.

include context of past spikes in his search interest.\nOverview  \nThe only developments concerning BYU wide-receiver Parker Kingston that have firm, published dates falling between 18 Feb 2026 and 23 Feb 2026 are legal-process deadlines imposed by the court. No games, team interviews, NIL appearances, publicity events or scheduled media opportunities involving Kingston are on record for that six-day period, and BYU\u2019s 2026 football schedule does not begin until 5 Sep 2026. The university has already dismissed Kingston from the program and stated that he is no longer a student, further reducing the likelihood of any athletics-related activity in the near term.  \n\n1.  Legal calendar (drives anticipated search interest)  \n\u2022 Kingston\u2019s next court appearance is set for Wednesday 25 Feb 2026 at 10:30 a.m. MT in Utah\u2019s Fifth Judicial District Court. (WGXA, 13 Feb 2026)  \n\u2022 Conditions of release require him to wear a GPS ankle monitor, avoid social media, and have no contact with the accuser or witnesses. (Fox Sports, 14 Feb 2026; WGXA, 13 Feb 2026)  \n\u2022 Because the appearance is scheduled for 25 Feb\u2014two days after the forecast window\u2014there are no additional hearings, filings, or deadlines specified for 18\u201323 Feb. Court dockets are public in Utah, and no interim motions or hearings have been noticed as of the latest reporting.  \n\n2.  Planned athletics activities  \n\u2022 BYU\u2019s 2026 season opener is 5 Sep 2026 against Utah Tech; the full 2026 schedule lists no events before that date. (BYU Athletics release, 21 Jan 2026; Big 12 master schedule)  \n\u2022 Spring-practice dates for BYU football have not been announced, but Kingston\u2019s dismissal from the team (SI-BYU, 14 Feb 2026) ends any possibility that he would participate or be interviewed.  \n\u2022 There are therefore zero games, scrimmages, or team-media availabilities featuring Kingston in the 18\u201323 Feb window.  \n\n3.  University and athletics-department statements  \n\u2022 BYU issued its initial statement acknowledging the arrest on 12 Feb 2026 (USA Today, 11 Feb 2026; NY Post, 13 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 A follow-up on 14 Feb 2026 confirmed Kingston is \u201cno longer a student and no longer a member of the football team.\u201d (SI-BYU, 14 Feb 2026; ABC News, 14 Feb 2026)  \n\u2022 No further institutional announcements are scheduled or hinted at for 18\u201323 Feb. Any additional comment is unlikely before the 25 Feb court date, because the university cited privacy laws and an ongoing legal process.  \n\n4.  Kingston\u2019s own public platform  \n\u2022 The bail order explicitly bars him from using social-media platforms while the case is pending. (Fox Sports, 14 Feb 2026; WGXA, 13 Feb 2026)  \n\u2022 Consequently, no live-streamed statements, TikTok videos, or other influencer-style content should emerge in the forecast period.  \n\n5.  Media coverage outlook  \nAlthough no events are scheduled, rolling news coverage can still create search-interest spikes when:  \na) Additional investigative details are released (e.g., the affidavit unsealed on 12 Feb 2026\u2014Yahoo Sports, 12 Feb 2026; The Athletic, 13 Feb 2026).  \nb) National outlets publish feature stories or opinion pieces on BYU\u2019s disciplinary policies.  \nNeither type of coverage is pre-scheduled, but both are plausible between 18 and 23 Feb because (i) reporters may file deeper dives during the lull before the 25 Feb hearing and (ii) sports-talk programs often revisit high-profile arrests in weekly cycles. Still, such pieces are speculative; no journalist has published a forthcoming-article date.  \n\n6.  Context of previous spikes in Google-search interest for \u201cparker kingston\u201d  \nA review of news coverage (aligned with historical Google Trends peaks) shows four clear catalysts:  \n\u2022 28 Dec 2024 \u2013 Punt-return TD vs. Colorado in the Alamo Bowl led highlight shows. (image caption in WGXA photo)  \n\u2022 12 Oct 2025 \u2013 Breakout 117-yard game and late TD vs. Arizona drew Big 12 attention (BYU schedule recap).  \n\u2022 27 Dec 2025 \u2013 Pop-Tarts Bowl performance against Georgia Tech put him on national radar (WGXA photo caption).  \n\u2022 11\u201314 Feb 2026 \u2013 Arrest, charging documents, and removal from BYU generated the largest spike to date. (Wide multi-source coverage above)  \nThese historic bursts suggest that the current legal matter is already the dominant driver of search volume, and any additional uptick before 23 Feb would probably hinge on a new legal filing or a high-visibility news package, not sporting activity.  \n\n7.  Summary for 18 Feb \u2013 23 Feb 2026  \nEvents/announcements definitively scheduled:  \n\u2022 NONE.  \nLegal status during window:  \n\u2022 Out on bail under strict conditions; next hearing 25 Feb 2026 (outside window).  \nTeam-related activity:  \n\u2022 NONE; Kingston dismissed from BYU roster 14 Feb 2026.  \nMedia or social media appearances:  \n\u2022 Prohibited from social media; no announced interviews.  \nImplication for Google Trends forecast:  \n\u2022 With no time-stamped events inside the window, the most likely scenario is a stabilization of search interest at post-arrest levels until coverage ramps up again on or just before 25 Feb.  \n\nRemaining information gaps  \n\u2022 Utah court docket could still add filings (e.g., motions) that would become public and newsworthy during the window, but no such filings are presently scheduled.  \n\u2022 BYU has not published spring-practice dates; if they are announced and include statements about roster changes, Kingston could be referenced indirectly.  \nBoth gaps would require monitoring of the Utah Court Xchange system and BYU athletics press releases, respectively; as of the latest available reporting, neither source lists activity for 18\u201323 Feb 2026.</Agent_report>\n\n<GoogleTrendsData term=\"parker kingston\">\nGoogle Trends US data for \"parker kingston\" (last 90 days):\n\nCurrent value: 4\n90-day mean: 2.5\n90-day std dev: 12.2\n\nBASE RATE ANALYSIS (using 5-day windows to match question timeframe):\n- In 92% of 5-day windows, the value changed by \u22643 points (\"Doesn't change\")\n- In 6% of 5-day windows, the value INCREASED by >3 points\n- In 2% of 5-day windows, the value DECREASED by >3 points\n\nRecent trend: increasing (last 7 days avg: 31.1 vs prior 7 days: 0.0)\n\nDAILY VALUES (last 30 days):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-20,0\n2026-01-21,0\n2026-01-22,0\n2026-01-23,0\n2026-01-24,0\n2026-01-25,0\n2026-01-26,0\n2026-01-27,0\n2026-01-28,0\n2026-01-29,0\n2026-01-30,0\n2026-01-31,0\n2026-02-01,0\n2026-02-02,0\n2026-02-03,0\n2026-02-04,0\n2026-02-05,0\n2026-02-06,0\n2026-02-07,0\n2026-02-08,0\n2026-02-09,0\n2026-02-10,0\n2026-02-11,0\n2026-02-12,100\n2026-02-13,45\n2026-02-14,40\n2026-02-15,15\n2026-02-16,8\n2026-02-17,6\n2026-02-18,4\n\nNote: Google Trends values are relative (0-100 scale), not absolute search volumes.\n</GoogleTrendsData>\n"
