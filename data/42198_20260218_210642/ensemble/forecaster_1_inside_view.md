Described as unprecedented "gray-zone" blockade rehearsal. **Factual**: ship-tracking data from named analysts. **Moderate quality**: tabloid source but citing specific analysts and data.

8. **Atlantic Council survey**: 447 experts from 72 countries; 63% believe world will be worse in 2036, 90% predict bipolar/multipolar structure. **Factual**: survey results. **Moderate quality**: expert aggregate but long timeframe.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- **Current CP exactly at threshold (12%)**: Multiple sources confirm this. The question requires CP to exceed 12%, making this a knife-edge situation.
- **Recent diplomatic tensions already absorbed**: Wang Yi's Feb 14 warnings occurred before Feb 16 CP reading of 12%. The market has already priced this in.
- **Expert consensus on low 2026 probability**: EIU maintains "unchanged" assessment with direct invasion "unlikely." Multiple experts (Thompson, CSIS surveys) suggest blockade more likely than invasion IF force used, but overall 2026 probability remains low.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- **Fishing vessel drill (Jan 9-12, 2026)**: 1,400 vessels in coordinated formation represents escalation in "gray-zone" tactics. Named analysts (Wang, Douglas) confirm unprecedented scale. This suggests increased Chinese capability/willingness for blockade scenarios but occurred 5+ weeks ago.
- **Declining PLA flights (January 2026)**: 5.4 aircraft/day is lowest since May 2024. Could indicate training phase completion (Chieh Chung) or be unrelated to politics (Thompson). Mixed signal - could suggest reduced immediate tension or shift to different tactics.
- **Trump-Xi dynamics**: Trump's "pretty soon" arms sales decision and upcoming China visit create uncertainty. Xi's Feb 5 warning about "prudence" suggests Chinese sensitivity, but Trump described call as "excellent," indicating diplomatic engagement continues.

**Weak Evidence:**
- **Metaphysical predictions**: Multiple feng shui/astrology forecasts. Disregard entirely - no empirical basis.
- **Kristof opinion piece**: Cites unnamed report with 30% 5-year probability. Lacks primary source; represents one columnist's interpretation.
- **Long-term surveys (2036 outlook)**: Atlantic Council survey about 2036 not directly relevant to 8-day CP movement.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe**: 8 days (Feb 18 to Feb 26, 2026)

**Current situation**: CP at exactly 12% on Feb 16. Question asks if CP will be HIGHER than 12% on Feb 26.

**If timeframe halved (4 days)**: Would significantly reduce probability of CP exceeding 12%. With only 4 days, very unlikely for major new information to emerge and be absorbed by forecasters. Probability would drop to ~25-30%.

**If timeframe doubled (16 days)**: Would increase probability of CP exceeding 12%. More time for Trump's arms sales decision, potential Chinese responses, or other developments. Probability would rise to ~50-55%.

**Key upcoming events in 8-day window**:
- Trump's arms sales decision ("pretty soon" as of Feb 17)
- Potential Chinese military exercises or responses
- Continued diplomatic maneuvering ahead of Trump's China visit

## (d) Justification

**Factors supporting CP increase above 12%:**
1. **Knife-edge positioning**: CP is exactly at 12%. Even minor upward movement (to 12.5% or 13%) triggers "Yes" resolution. This creates asymmetric risk.
2. **Trump arms sales decision imminent**: His Feb 17 statement suggests announcement within days. If he approves significant sales, China may respond with exercises/rhetoric, pushing CP up 1-3 points.
3. **Fishing vessel drill demonstrates escalation**: January's 1,400-vessel coordination shows China practicing blockade scenarios, potentially updating forecaster priors about Chinese capability.
4. **Recent pattern of exercises following arms sales**: December 2025 $11B sale triggered "Justice Mission 2025" drills. If Trump announces new sales, similar response could occur.

**Factors supporting CP stability or decrease:**
1. **Recent tensions already priced in**: Wang Yi's Feb 14 warnings already reflected in Feb 16 CP of 12%. No new major escalation since then.
2. **Declining PLA flights suggest reduced immediate pressure**: January's lowest activity since May 2024 could indicate tactical pause or training phase, not imminent action.
3. **Expert consensus unchanged**: EIU explicitly states "outlook remains unchanged" despite December drills. Direct invasion remains "unlikely."
4. **Trump-Xi diplomatic engagement**: "Excellent" call characterization and upcoming visit suggest managed relationship, not crisis trajectory.
5. **Short timeframe limits information arrival**: 8 days is brief for major strategic shifts.
6. **Economic/military deterrents remain**: US intervention likelihood, global diplomatic costs, and operational challenges persist.

**Critical assessment**: The outside view base rate of 42% was calibrated for a CP exactly at threshold with moderate recent tensions. Current evidence largely confirms this assessment:

- The fishing vessel drill is the most significant new capability demonstration, but occurred 5+ weeks ago
- Declining PLA flights could be interpreted as reducing immediate tension
- Trump's arms sales decision is the key near-term catalyst
- Expert assessments remain stable (EIU "unchanged")

However, the knife-edge positioning (exactly 12%) creates asymmetry: any minor escalatory news pushes CP above threshold, while it takes more significant de-escalation to push it meaningfully below 12%.

**Adjustment rationale**: The fishing vessel drill and Trump's imminent decision represent moderate evidence for potential upward movement. However, the already-priced-in diplomatic tensions and expert consensus on low 2026 probability provide counterbalance. The 8-day window is long enough for Trump's decision but short enough that absent major news, CP likely remains stable.

Net assessment: Slight upward adjustment from 42% to 45% warranted due to:
1. Asymmetric threshold positioning (exactly 12%)
2. Trump decision timing (imminent)
3. Fishing vessel drill demonstrates increased Chinese capability
4. Historical pattern of Chinese exercises following US arms sales

But limited adjustment because:
1. Recent tensions already absorbed
2. Expert consensus unchanged
3. Declining PLA flights
4. Diplomatic engagement continuing

## Probability Calibration

Starting from outside view base rate of 42%, adjusting to 45% based on:
- **+5%**: Knife-edge positioning at exactly 12% creates asymmetric risk for "Yes" resolution
- **+3%**: Trump arms sales decision imminent and likely within 8-day window
- **+2%**: Fishing vessel drill demonstrates escalated Chinese capability
- **-4%**: Recent diplomatic tensions already priced into current 12% CP
- **-3%**: Expert consensus remains stable; EIU assessment "unchanged"

The adjustment is modest because the evidence is mixed. The most significant factor is the exact threshold positioning - being at precisely 12% means any minor upward movement triggers resolution, while requiring more significant downward movement to clearly resolve "No."

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Metaculus CP for "China attack/blockade Taiwan in 2026" exceed 12% on Feb 26, 2026? Currently at exactly 12% on Feb 16. 8-day forecast window.

2. **Base rate**: Outside view established 42% probability based on exact threshold positioning, recent tensions already absorbed, short timeframe, and expert consensus on low 2026 action probability.

3. **Consistency**: "45 out of 100 times, the Metaculus CP exceeds 12% on Feb 26." This aligns with a knife-edge situation where minor news could tip either direction, with slight bias toward upward movement due to Trump's imminent decision and asymmetric threshold.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - CP currently exactly at 12% threshold (factual, verified)
   - Trump arms sales decision "pretty soon" per Feb 17 statement (factual, AFP/Nikkei)
   - 1,400 fishing vessel drill Jan 9-12 shows blockade rehearsal (factual, named analysts)
   - EIU assessment "unchanged," invasion "unlikely" (factual, institutional source)
   - Wang Yi Feb 14 warnings already reflected in Feb 16 CP (factual, timing verified)

5. **Blind spot**: Trump announces major arms sale package (Feb 19-25) triggering immediate Chinese military exercises around Taiwan. This would likely spike CP to 15-18%, making my 45% forecast look too conservative. However, even if Trump decides, announcement/Chinese response might occur after Feb 26 or be absorbed gradually.

6. **Status quo**: The world changes slowly. CP has been stable at 12% despite recent tensions. In an 8-day window with no major scheduled events, status quo (CP remains 11-13%) is most likely outcome. However, Trump's decision timing creates genuine uncertainty. 45% reflects this balance between status quo inertia and near-term catalyst.

Probability: 45%
