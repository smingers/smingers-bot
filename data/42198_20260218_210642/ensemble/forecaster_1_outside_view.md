Analysis:

(a) Source analysis:

**The Independent (July 11, 2024)**: Reports on record Chinese military activity around Taiwan with 66 aircraft detected in 24 hours. This is a reliable mainstream news source documenting historical events. The article provides factual military statistics but predates the forecasting period by over 18 months.

**Manifold Markets discussion**: Contains a mix of expert surveys and anonymous commentary. The CSIS expert survey (63% consider invasion "possible" in 10 years, 80% see blockade as most probable scenario) represents credible expert opinion. Oriana Skylar Mastro is a named expert. The "Calibrated Ghosts" analysis and anonymous commenters represent less reliable opinions. The Sentinel Team forecasters (43% chance by 2030) represent another expert aggregate. Date appears to be late 2025/early 2026.

**Astralcodexten article**: This is about contest structure, not substantive Taiwan analysis. Not relevant to the forecast.

**Nikkei Asia (February 17, 2026)**: Recent, reliable source reporting Trump's statement about deciding on Taiwan arms sales "pretty soon" ahead of his China visit. This is factual reporting of current events, highly relevant to the immediate timeframe.

**News.az (February 2026)**: Reports Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi's statements at Munich conference calling for cooperation while warning about Taiwan tensions. Cites Al Jazeera as original source. Factual reporting of official statements from a named government official.

**Daily Sabah (February 14, 2026)**: Reports Wang Yi's "red line" warning at Munich Security Conference via AFP. This is factual reporting of official Chinese government statements from a named official at a major international forum.

**Agent Report**: Confirms that historical CP data exists via Metaculus API but was not retrieved. Notes current CP is 12% as of February 16, 2026. This is a factual limitation report.

Key factual observations:
- Current CP on Feb 16, 2026: 12%
- Recent diplomatic tensions (Wang Yi warnings, Feb 14-17)
- Trump's imminent China visit and arms sales decision
- Expert consensus: blockade more likely than invasion; 80% see blockade as most probable kinetic scenario
- Historical pattern: Chinese military activity around Taiwan has been increasing

(b) Reference class analysis:

**Reference Class 1: Metaculus community prediction stability over 10-day periods**
- Suitability: High. This directly addresses how much CP typically moves in short timeframes.
- Challenge: No historical data provided for this specific question's volatility.

**Reference Class 2: Geopolitical crisis probability changes during diplomatic tension periods**
- Suitability: Medium. The Munich warnings and Trump's China visit represent heightened diplomatic activity.
- Pattern: Diplomatic warnings often don't immediately translate to action; markets/forecasters typically discount rhetoric.

**Reference Class 3: Metaculus CP movements on Taiwan conflict questions**
- Suitability: High if data were available. Would show typical volatility patterns.
- Challenge: Agent report confirms data exists but wasn't retrieved.

**Most suitable**: Reference Class 1 (CP stability) combined with Reference Class 2 (diplomatic tension periods), given the specific 10-day forecast window.

(c) Timeframe analysis:

**Prediction timeframe**: 8 days (from Feb 18 to Feb 26, 2026)

**Current situation**:
- CP is exactly at the threshold (12%) as of Feb 16
- Question asks if CP will be HIGHER than 12% on Feb 26
- Recent events (Feb 14-17): Wang Yi warnings, Trump arms sales comments
- Upcoming: Trump's China visit "in coming weeks"

**Relevant patterns**:
- Short timeframes (8 days) typically show limited CP movement unless major events occur
- The CP has already absorbed Wang Yi's Feb 14 warnings (it's at 12% on Feb 16)
- For CP to rise above 12%, new information would need to emerge between Feb 18-26
- Expert consensus suggests blockade/coercion more likely than invasion, but 2026 invasion probability remains low (CSIS experts, Manifold discussions suggest 10-15% for invasion by 2030)

(d) Justification:

The question asks whether the CP will exceed 12% (currently exactly 12%) over an 8-day period. Several factors are relevant:

**Factors favoring CP increase (above 12%)**:
1. Recent diplomatic tensions (Wang Yi's "red line" warnings on Feb 14)
2. Trump's imminent decision on arms sales could provoke Chinese response
3. Trump's upcoming China visit creates uncertainty
4. Any new Chinese military exercises or incidents could spike the forecast

**Factors favoring CP stability or decrease (at or below 12%)**:
1. The CP has already absorbed recent news (it's at 12% on Feb 16, after the Feb 14 warnings)
2. Short 8-day timeframe limits information arrival
3. Diplomatic rhetoric often doesn't translate to immediate action
4. Expert consensus suggests low probability of 2026 action (CSIS, various forecasters)
5. Economic costs to China remain prohibitive
6. No indication of imminent military mobilization
7. Trump's China visit suggests diplomatic engagement, not confrontation

**Critical insight**: The CP needs to move from exactly 12.00% to above 12.00%. This is a very narrow threshold. Even a small upward movement (to 12.5% or 13%) would trigger a "Yes" resolution, but the CP could also remain stable or decrease slightly.

The base rate for significant geopolitical events (attack/blockade) in any given year remains low. The 8-day window is too short for major strategic shifts but long enough for news-driven volatility.

Outside view calibration:

**Rough figures to tether to**:
- Current CP: 12% (exactly at threshold)
- Expert estimates for 2026 action: Generally 10-20% range
- CSIS: 80% see blockade as most probable kinetic scenario IF force is used
- Various forecasters suggest 10-15% for major action by 2030

**Calibration considerations**:
1. The question is meta-forecasting (predicting forecasters' predictions), not the underlying event
2. CP movements are typically less volatile than individual forecasts
3. Recent news has already been absorbed (CP at 12% on Feb 16)
4. For a "Yes" resolution, CP needs to rise even slightly above 12%
5. The 8-day window is short; absent major new developments, CPs tend toward stability
6. However, any Chinese military exercise, Trump arms sale announcement, or incident could push CP up 1-3 percentage points

**Historical upset rate**: In geopolitical forecasting, sudden escalations are relatively rare but not impossible. The domain shows moderate volatility around diplomatic events.

**Probability reasoning**:
- If no new major news: CP likely stays 11-13% (50% chance of being >12%)
- If minor escalatory news: CP likely rises to 13-15% (would trigger "Yes")
- If major escalatory news: CP could spike to 15-20% (would trigger "Yes")
- If de-escalatory news: CP could fall to 10-11% (would trigger "No")

Given the current exact threshold positioning, recent tensions already priced in, but potential for news in an 8-day window, I estimate roughly 40-45% chance the CP exceeds 12% on Feb 26.
