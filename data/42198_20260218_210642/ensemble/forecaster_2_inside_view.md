**(b) Evidence Analysis:**

**Strong Evidence:**
- Fishing vessel drill (Feb 18 report of Jan 9-12 event): Multiple analysts (Wang, Douglas) confirm unprecedented 1,400-vessel coordinated formation. This represents concrete escalation in "gray zone" capability demonstration. However, this occurred 5+ weeks ago and is already in the past - likely already priced into the 12.00% CP.

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Trump arms sale decision imminent (Feb 17-18, multiple sources): Creates near-term catalyst for either escalation (if approved) or de-escalation (if delayed/denied). Could move CP in either direction within 8 days.
- Xi-Trump call (Feb 5): Xi emphasized Taiwan as "most important issue" and urged "prudence" on arms sales. Establishes current tension level but 13 days old.
- December 2025 military drills: Well-documented but 7-8 weeks old, likely already incorporated in current 12.00% CP.

**Weak Evidence:**
- PLA flight decline (Feb 10): Suggests possible de-escalation but experts disagree on interpretation. Thompson skeptical it's politically motivated.
- Various prediction articles: Speculative, non-expert sources.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis:**

**Prediction window: 8.0 days (Feb 18 to Feb 26, 2026)**

This is an extremely short timeframe for geopolitical shifts. The question asks whether the Metaculus CP will rise above 12.00% by Feb 26. 

Key consideration: The underlying Taiwan question resolves at end of 2026 (10+ months away). For such distant questions, CPs typically exhibit:
- Low volatility day-to-day (median 0.3pp per week)
- Mean reversion toward long-term priors
- Large moves only on major news

**If timeframe halved (4 days)**: Probability would drop to ~25% - insufficient time for news cycle to develop and forecasters to react.

**If timeframe doubled (16 days)**: Probability would rise to ~50% - more opportunity for Trump's arms decision to be announced and processed by community.

**(d) Justification:**

**Starting point: 35% outside view base rate**

**Factors pushing UP:**
1. Trump arms sale decision imminent (moderate evidence, +8pp): Multiple sources confirm decision coming "pretty soon" before China visit in April. If announced in next 8 days and approved, could spike CP upward. However, could also be delayed or denied, causing drop.

2. Recent fishing vessel drill revelation (moderate evidence, +3pp): While the drill occurred Jan 9-12, the detailed analysis was published Feb 18 (TODAY). New forecasters seeing this analysis might update upward, though sophisticated forecasters likely already knew.

**Factors pushing DOWN:**
1. PLA flight activity decline (weak evidence, -2pp): January 2026 showed lowest cross-strait flights since May 2024. While experts debate interpretation, this is mildly reassuring data.

2. No imminent catalyst scheduled (moderate evidence, -4pp): No major PLA exercises, summits, or deadlines in next 8 days. Trump's China visit is April (6+ weeks away). Status quo favors slight downward drift.

3. Mean reversion tendency (moderate evidence, -5pp): For questions 10+ months from resolution, Metaculus CPs tend to drift toward long-term priors. The 12.00% level may represent slight overreaction to December drills that forecasters will correct.

**Net adjustment: +8 +3 -2 -4 -5 = 0pp**

The fishing vessel drill news is significant but already occurred 5+ weeks ago. The Trump decision is the main wild card but timing is uncertain. The slight upward pressure from potential arms sale news is roughly balanced by mean reversion and absence of scheduled catalysts.

**Probability Calibration:**

Starting from 35% outside view, the inside view evidence suggests no major adjustment. The Trump arms decision is the key variable but could push either direction and timing is uncertain within the 8-day window.

The current CP of exactly 12.00% sitting on the threshold means even a 0.01pp uptick resolves YES. However, Metaculus's recent-weighting means new forecasts can easily push it down if no news emerges.

Given:
- Balanced evidence (arms sale uncertainty vs. mean reversion)
- Very short timeframe limiting news development
- CP sitting exactly on threshold (vulnerable to noise)
- Historical pattern showing 42% up-tick rate but 52% down-tick rate from exact thresholds

I adjust slightly downward from 35% to account for the mean-reversion tendency on long-horizon questions during quiet periods.

**Final calibrated prediction: 33%**

**Checklist:**

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Metaculus community prediction for "China attacks/blockades Taiwan in 2026" exceed 12.00% on Feb 26, 2026? Currently at 12.00%.

2. **Base rate**: 35% from outside view analysis of historical Metaculus mirror questions showing 42% up-tick rate from exact thresholds, adjusted for mean reversion.

3. **Consistency**: "33 out of 100 times, the CP rises above 12.00% in the next 8 days." This aligns with slight downward pressure from mean reversion balanced against potential Trump arms sale news.

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Trump arms sale decision coming "soon" - could move CP either way (moderate, recent)
   - 1,400 fishing vessel drill Jan 9-12 revealed today - escalation signal but old news (moderate, mixed timing)
   - PLA flight decline in January - mild de-escalation signal (weak, recent)
   - No scheduled catalysts in next 8 days - favors status quo/drift down (moderate)
   - Mean reversion tendency for long-horizon questions (moderate, structural)

5. **Blind spot**: Trump announces major arms sale package in next 3 days, triggering immediate PLA response exercise. This could spike CP to 14-15% quickly. Would increase probability to ~60%.

6. **Status quo**: CP has been stable at 12.00% for at least 2 days. In absence of major news, slight downward drift is more likely than upward movement for questions 10+ months from resolution. The 33% probability appropriately weights this tendency while acknowledging the Trump decision wild card.

Probability: 33%
