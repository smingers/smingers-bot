Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**The Independent (July 11, 2024):**
- **Content:** Reports record 66 Chinese aircraft detected around Taiwan in 24 hours, with 56 breaching the median line
- **Quality:** Reputable international news outlet with verifiable statistics from Taiwan's defense ministry
- **Date:** July 2024 - 7+ months before question opening, provides historical context but not current dynamics
- **Key fact vs opinion:** Aircraft numbers are factual; characterization as "record" is verifiable fact

**Manifold Market Discussion (date unclear, likely 2025-2026):**
- **Content:** Discussion of full-scale invasion probability before 2030, includes CSIS expert survey data
- **Quality:** Mixed - contains both expert survey data (high quality) and anonymous commenter opinions (low quality)
- **Key facts:** CSIS survey shows 63% of experts consider invasion "possible" in next 10 years; 80% probability assigned to blockade as most likely scenario; Metaculus crowd gives ~12% for invasion by 2028
- **Expert opinions:** Oriana Skylar Mastro (credible expert) assesses nearly 100% likelihood of "use of force" in next 5 years; Sentinel Team forecasters estimate 43% chance of invasion attempt by 2030
- **Note:** This discusses full-scale invasion (1000+ troops), not the broader criteria in question 41139 which includes attacks/blockades

**Astral Codex Ten (2026):**
- **Content:** Call for forecasting contest questions
- **Quality:** Not relevant to Taiwan question substance
- **Relevance:** None for this analysis

**Nikkei Asia (February 17, 2026):**
- **Content:** Trump to decide on Taiwan arms sales "pretty soon"; Xi Jinping issued warning in recent phone call
- **Quality:** Reputable Asian business/political news source
- **Date:** February 17, 2026 - 1 day before question opening, highly relevant
- **Key fact:** Imminent decision on arms sales creates near-term uncertainty

**News.az (date unclear, likely February 2026):**
- **Content:** Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi at Munich conference urging cooperation, warning over Taiwan
- **Quality:** Secondary source citing Al Jazeera; named official at known forum
- **Key fact vs opinion:** Wang Yi's statements are factual quotes; his characterization of US attitude is his opinion

**Daily Sabah (February 14, 2026):**
- **Content:** Wang Yi warns US of "confrontation" over Taiwan "plotting" at Munich Security Conference
- **Quality:** Turkish outlet citing AFP; named official at major conference
- **Date:** February 14, 2026 - 4 days before question opening, very recent and relevant
- **Key fact:** Wang Yi explicitly warned of "red line" and potential "confrontation" if US crosses it

**Agent Report:**
- **Content:** Unable to retrieve historical CP data for question 41139
- **Key finding:** Current CP is 12% as of Feb 16, 2026; no historical trajectory available
- **Implication:** Cannot analyze recent volatility or trends in community prediction

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Metaculus community prediction stability over 10-day periods:**
   - Relevant because we're predicting whether CP will move >0% in 8 days
   - Challenge: No historical data provided for this specific question

2. **Taiwan crisis escalation patterns:**
   - Relevant because underlying question concerns China-Taiwan conflict
   - Historical pattern: Multiple Taiwan Strait crises (1954-55, 1958, 1995-96) but no actual invasion/blockade since 1949
   - Recent pattern: Increased military exercises but no crossing of attack/blockade threshold

3. **Metaculus CP movement on geopolitical questions during news cycles:**
   - Relevant because recent news (Wang Yi warnings, Trump arms sales decision) could drive CP changes
   - Typical pattern: CPs on geopolitical questions tend to be sticky unless major news breaks

4. **Base rate of Metaculus CP increases >0% over short timeframes:**
   - Most directly relevant to the meta-question
   - Without historical data, must reason from general principles

**Most suitable reference class:** Metaculus CP movement patterns on geopolitical questions, combined with current news cycle analysis.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 8 days (February 18 to February 26, 2026)

**Key temporal factors:**

1. **Current CP is exactly at threshold (12.00%):** Any upward movement >0% triggers Yes resolution
2. **Recent news cycle (Feb 14-17):**
   - Feb 14: Wang Yi "red line" warning at Munich
   - Feb 17: Trump announces imminent Taiwan arms sales decision
   - These are within 1-4 days of question opening

3. **Upcoming events in 8-day window:**
   - Trump's arms sales decision (timing: "pretty soon")
   - Potential Trump visit to China ("coming weeks")
   - Any Chinese military response to arms sales announcement

4. **Historical pattern:** Taiwan tensions typically escalate gradually through increased military exercises, not sudden attacks. However, Metaculus CPs can move quickly on news.

## (d) Justification

**Factors favoring CP increase (>12%):**

1. **Recent escalatory rhetoric:** Wang Yi's Feb 14 "red line" warning and "confrontation" language is unusually direct
2. **Imminent policy decision:** Trump's arms sales decision could trigger Chinese military response or exercises
3. **Recency bias:** Fresh news often drives short-term CP increases on Metaculus
4. **Low threshold:** CP only needs to rise by any amount >0% (e.g., 12.01% would resolve Yes)
5. **Expert assessment of near-term risk:** Mastro's "nearly 100% likelihood of use of force in next 5 years" and CSIS 80% probability of blockade scenario suggest elevated baseline risk

**Factors favoring CP stability (≤12%):**

1. **Status quo bias:** CPs tend to be sticky without major breaking news
2. **Historical base rate:** No actual attack/blockade since 1949 despite many crises
3. **Economic deterrence:** China faces $5-10 trillion cost estimate for Taiwan conflict
4. **Current CP already reflects recent news:** The 12% may already incorporate Wang Yi warnings
5. **Short timeframe:** Only 8 days for news to develop and forecasters to react
6. **Underlying probability remains low:** Even experts estimating high "use of force" likelihood over 5 years doesn't translate to high probability in 2026 specifically

**Critical consideration:** The question asks about CP movement, not underlying event probability. The CP could increase due to:
- Forecaster overreaction to news
- New information about Chinese military preparations
- Escalatory statements or actions
- Trump arms sales announcement triggering Chinese exercises

However, the CP could also remain stable if:
- No major new developments occur in 8 days
- Forecasters view recent rhetoric as routine posturing
- Forecasters already priced in recent news

Outside view calibration:

**Anchoring considerations:**

1. **Current CP of 12%:** This represents the crowd's assessment of ~12% annual probability of attack/blockade in 2026. This is already elevated compared to historical base rates.

2. **Expert forecasts:** CSIS survey suggests 80% probability of blockade being "most probable scenario" if force is used, but only 52% assess "escalation short of invasion" as likely/very likely. This suggests experts see elevated but not imminent risk.

3. **News cycle timing:** The Wang Yi warnings (Feb 14) and Trump arms sales announcement (Feb 17) are very recent. Metaculus forecasters typically need 1-3 days to fully incorporate news into predictions. By Feb 26, these events will be 12 and 9 days old respectively.

4. **Threshold sensitivity:** The CP being exactly at 12.00% means even a small increase resolves Yes. This is a meta-question about forecaster behavior, not underlying geopolitics.

5. **Historical upset rate:** Geopolitical forecasting questions often see CPs move 1-3 percentage points on significant news. The question is whether the recent news is significant enough and fresh enough to drive movement over the next 8 days.

**Probability reasoning:**

- Probability that major escalatory news breaks in next 8 days: ~20-25% (Trump arms sales decision, Chinese military response, unexpected incident)
- Probability that existing news drives delayed CP increase: ~15-20% (forecasters reassess after initial news)
- Probability that CP remains stable or decreases: ~55-65% (no new major news, status quo bias, recent news already priced in)

**Calibration against reference classes:**

- Short-term CP stability is common on geopolitical questions absent major breaking news
- However, the very recent news cycle (within 1-4 days of question opening) suggests incomplete price-in
- The low threshold (any increase >0%) significantly raises probability of Yes resolution

**Final calibration:**

Given:
- Very recent escalatory rhetoric (4 days old)
- Imminent policy decision (Trump arms sales)
- Low threshold for Yes resolution (>0% increase)
- But also: status quo bias, 8-day window may not produce major new developments

I estimate ~35-40% probability that the CP rises above 12.00% by February 26.
