Analysis:
1) Paraphrase / resolution alignment  
This resolves **Yes** iff the Metaculus community prediction for “Will China attack or blockade Taiwan during 2026?” is **strictly > 12.00%** at **2026-02-26 20:05:56**; otherwise **No**.

(a) Source analysis (what each says; quality; facts vs opinions)
- EIU (2026-02-03): Reports late-Dec 2025 “Justice Mission 2025” drills simulating strikes/blockade; notes “grey zone less grey”; assesses invasion unlikely; blockade/inadvertent escalation are key risks. Quality: high (institutional analysis). Facts: drills occurred; opinions: relative likelihoods/deterrents.
- Focus Taiwan/CNA (2025-12-29): Describes PLA exercise scope/aims (incl. “blockade of key ports”). Quality: solid for official statements. Facts: exercise announcement/quoted language; opinions: MAC characterization.
- Taipei Times (2026-02-10): Reports Jan 2026 median-line crossing flight activity down; experts caution sortie counts can mislead; suggests training shift to more complex joint ops. Quality: medium (good quoting, but interpretive). Facts: reported averages; opinions: meaning of decline.
- BBC (2026-02-05): Xi–Trump call; Xi urges prudence on arms sales; Trump frames call positively; notes April China trip planning; cites CFR’s David Sacks on coercion strategy. Quality: high. Facts: call/quotes; opinions: analyst interpretations.
- Nikkei Asia (2026-02-17): Trump says decision on arms sales “pretty soon” ahead of China trip. Quality: high, but excerpt limited. Facts: Trump statement; opinions: framing.
- AFP (2026-02-17) duplicate of arms-sales-soon: Similar content; reliable wire. Facts: statement; little analysis.
- AskNews: The Sun “fishing boats blockade drill” (2026-02-18): Claims ~1,400 fishing vessels in disciplined formations; cites ship-tracking analysts/CSIS Poling. Quality: low-medium (tabloid), but some verifiable mechanism (AIS tracking) + named analysts; treat as suggestive not definitive. Facts: if AIS analysis is accurate; opinions: “rehearsal” interpretation.
- Bloomberg-cost story via Taiwanese outlet (2026-02-18): Summarizes Bloomberg research on catastrophic economic costs; claims “pillars of status quo eroding.” Quality: medium (secondary retelling of Bloomberg). Facts: cost-estimate is model output (not an event); opinions: strategic interpretation.
- John Quiggin blog (2026-02-04): Argues invasion by 2027 unlikely; blockade ineffective; emphasizes amphibious constraints; notes Trump’s stance might reduce US commitment. Quality: medium (informed but blog). Facts: some force-structure claims; opinions: inference on likelihoods.
- NYT column paraphrased in ChinaTimes (2026-01-18): Mentions “30% in 5 years” estimate; discusses blockade risks; critiques Taiwanese readiness. Quality: mixed (column + secondary). Facts: columnist’s claims; opinions: heavy.
- Prophecy/astrology pieces (multiple, Dec 2025–Feb 2026): Not decision-useful for forecasting CP among Metaculus users; quality: very low. Facts: none beyond “someone said X.”

(b) Evidence analysis (weighted for impact on *community prediction movement by Feb 26*, not true geopolitics)
Strong evidence:
- None that directly implies CP *must* move up/down by Feb 26. (We lack direct Metaculus trend/participation data.)

Moderate evidence (could move CP by ~0.2–2.0 pts if noticed):
- “Arms sales decision soon” (Nikkei/AFP/BBC, Feb 5–17): clear, near-term catalyst; plausible to trigger either escalation or de-escalation narratives → raises odds of CP movement (direction ambiguous, slight upward skew).
- EIU + CNA reporting of blockade-simulating drills (Dec 2025; EIU Feb 3): reinforces blockade as salient mechanism; could nudge CP up if users re-anchor to blockade criteria.

Weak evidence (small/volatile nudges; may or may not be absorbed by Metaculus):
- Taipei Times “flight activity down” (Feb 10): could nudge CP down for some, but experts explicitly caution it’s not a clean de-escalation signal.
- The Sun “1,400 fishing boats drill” (Feb 18): if picked up by higher-quality outlets or discussed on Metaculus, could nudge up; but tabloid source may limit uptake among forecasters.
- Bloomberg-cost modeling: tends to support “war is costly therefore less likely,” but also “risk is rising”; net effect on CP uncertain and probably small over 8 days.
- Blogs/columns: may influence a minority; direction mixed.

(c) Timeframe analysis
- Time left: ~8 days (2026-02-18 to 2026-02-26). This is a “short-horizon CP-jitter” question.
- If timeframe were halved (~4 days): lower chance of a discrete catalyst landing and being incorporated → lower chance CP ends >12, especially if “sticky-at-12.00” behavior dominates.
- If timeframe were doubled (~16 days): higher chance of an arms-sales decision, PRC response, or incident → higher chance CP moves off exactly 12.00, with a modest upward skew.

(d) Justification: how this shifts the 37% outside view
Outside-view base rate (given): 37% that CP > 12% by Feb 26.

Key inside-view adjustments:
- Upward pressure: Multiple reputable reports emphasize (i) blockade rehearsals as a realistic tool and (ii) an imminent US arms-sales decision—exactly the kind of near-term news that tends to produce Metaculus edits. Even a small uptick (e.g., 12.01%) wins.
- Downward / status-quo pressure: The current CP is exactly at the cutoff; if forecasters do nothing, **No** wins (since “=12.00%” is No). Also, some indicators (reduced median-line crossings; Xi–Trump “excellent call”; improved trade détente vibes) can support “managed competition” narratives that blunt risk-up moves.

Net: I think the “near-term catalyst” factor slightly increases the chance the CP ends **above** 12% versus the pure outside view, but not dramatically because (1) direction of arms-sales news is unclear, and (2) CPs can be sticky when nothing clearly new happens.

Probability calibration
- Status quo (no major new developments; limited participation): moderate chance CP stays at exactly ~12.00 → favors **No**.
- Catalyst scenario (arms-sale decision or widely noticed blockade-rehearsal reporting): more likely than not to create at least a small upward nudge, but could also cause a dip if it signals de-escalation.
- Final inside-view adjustment: +3 percentage points from 37% to reflect slightly elevated odds of “something happens that nudges the median above 12.”

Checklist:
1) Paraphrase: Yes iff target Metaculus CP is strictly >12.00% at 2026-02-26 20:05:56; else No.  
2) Outside view base rate: 37%.  
3) Consistency check: “40 out of 100 times, the CP ends above 12.00% by the timestamp.” Reasonable given short-horizon stickiness + some catalysts.  
4) Top evidence (<=20 words each):
   - Trump says Taiwan arms-sales decision “pretty soon” (Nikkei/AFP), a near-term CP-moving catalyst.
   - Recent drills explicitly simulated blockade/port pressure (EIU/CNA), salient to resolution criteria of target question.
   - Some de-escalation signals (lower median-line flights; Xi–Trump cordiality) counterbalance risk-up moves.
5) Blind spot: CP may be “sticky at exactly 12.00%” due to limited forecaster activity/median mechanics → would make Yes much less likely.  
6) Status quo outcome: CP stays at 12.00% ⇒ **No**.

Probability: 40%
