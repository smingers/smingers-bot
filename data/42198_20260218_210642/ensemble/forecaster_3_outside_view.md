Analysis:

### (a) Source analysis (summary, quality, date; facts vs opinions)

1) **The Independent (Jul 11, 2024) – “Record number of Chinese warplanes breach Taiwan airspace”**  
   - **What it says (facts):** Reports a 24h count of **66 PLA aircraft** around Taiwan, **56 crossing the median line**, plus **7 PLAN vessels**; ties the activity to geopolitical context (NATO summit, Western criticism of China).  
   - **Quality/date:** Mainstream outlet; the factual counts are likely ultimately sourced from Taiwan’s defense ministry. **But it’s old (2024)** relative to the 2026-02-26 CP checkpoint.  
   - **Usefulness:** Provides background that elevated activity is not anomalous; doesn’t directly inform **8‑day** CP drift.

2) **Manifold / “MetaculusBot” summary (undated in prompt; includes 2025/2026 context)**  
   - **What it says (facts-ish):** Mixes claims about exercises, ship counts, arms packages, and some expert-survey style statements (e.g., CSIS survey) plus market probabilities. Some items are difficult to verify from the excerpt alone.  
   - **What it says (opinions):** Interprets invasion feasibility; asserts blockade is “most probable” in some expert scenarios; includes miscellaneous commenter takes and “Claude agents.”  
   - **Quality/date:** As a secondary summary, **uneven reliability**; some cited experts (e.g., Oriana Skylar Mastro) are identifiable, but the excerpt is not primary sourcing.  
   - **Usefulness:** Suggests a broader backdrop: experts often view **coercion/blockade** as more plausible than full invasion, but mapping that to *“during 2026”* and then to *CP movement over 8 days* is indirect.

3) **Astral Codex Ten (call for Metaculus/ACX questions)**  
   - **What it says:** Contest meta-information, not Taiwan-specific.  
   - **Quality/date:** Fine as context; **not informative** for this forecast.

4) **Nikkei Asia (Feb 17, 2026) – Trump arms sales decision “soon,” China trip looms**  
   - **What it says (facts):** Trump says Taiwan arms sale decision soon; this is happening ahead of a China trip; mentions Xi warning in a call (details not in excerpt).  
   - **Quality/date:** High-quality outlet; **timely (very close to the CP checkpoint)**.  
   - **Usefulness:** This kind of headline can cause **small short-term sentiment shifts** on Metaculus (up or down depending on interpretation), but absent concrete escalatory actions it usually doesn’t generate large repricings.

5) **news.az summary (Wang Yi at Munich) & Daily Sabah/AFP (Feb 14, 2026) – warnings over Taiwan “red line”**  
   - **What it says (facts):** At Munich Security Conference, Wang Yi issues strong warnings; reiterates sensitivity of Taiwan issue; signals preparedness for risks.  
   - **Quality/date:** AFP carry (via Daily Sabah) is generally credible for “X said Y” at an event; news.az is a secondary wrapper. **Timely.**  
   - **Usefulness:** Rhetorical escalation is common; tends to move forecasts only modestly unless paired with operational moves.

6) **Agent report (CP history retrieval failed)**  
   - **What it says (facts):** No CP timeline data retrieved; suggests the Metaculus API endpoint that would provide it.  
   - **Quality/date:** Useful procedural note; the key point is we **lack empirical CP volatility/jump history** for this exact question—so we must lean more on general base rates of Metaculus CP movement over short windows.

### (b) Reference class analysis

Because the question is about **the Metaculus community prediction changing** over **8 days**, the best reference class is not “China attacks Taiwan” but rather:

1) **Metaculus binary geopolitical questions: probability change over ~1 week when starting near the eventual comparison threshold**  
   - **Pros:** Directly matches the mechanism (crowd median, recency-weighted) and timeframe.  
   - **Cons:** We don’t have the specific historical volatility distribution for Q41139.

2) **Taiwan/China-related Metaculus questions: short-horizon CP stability absent a discrete crisis**  
   - **Pros:** Similar topic, similar news cycle dynamics.  
   - **Cons:** Still not directly observable here without timeline data.

**Most suitable:** (1) general Metaculus short-horizon CP movement on geopolitics binaries, because the resolution is literally about CP > 12.00% on a date.

### (c) Timeframe analysis

- **Now:** 2026-02-18  
- **Checkpoint:** 2026-02-26  
- **Time left:** ~**8 days**

General historical pattern on Metaculus over such short windows:
- **Absent a major new development**, community predictions on mature geopolitical questions often **move slowly** (fractions of a percentage point to ~1 pp), because many forecasters don’t update daily and the aggregation is a **median** (less sensitive than a mean).
- A big jump typically requires a **discrete, widely-covered event** (e.g., shooting incident, announced exercise with unusual features, confirmed blockade-like interference).

Also, an important structural consideration: the underlying target question is “attack or blockade during 2026.” Over time, **if nothing happens**, the rational probability should **gradually drift downward** (less remaining time in 2026). Over 8 days in late February this effect is small, but it is directionally **down**, not up.

---

### (d) Justification (outside view)

**Status quo if nothing changed:**  
- If there are **few/no new forecasts** between now and Feb 26, the CP could remain at **exactly 12.00%**, which would resolve this meta-question to **No** (since it must be *higher* than 12.00%).

**What tends to produce “Yes” (CP > 12.00%) over 8 days:**  
- A **new concrete escalatory development** (e.g., unusual PLA operations, an incident at sea/air, explicit blockade rehearsal framed as such, etc.) that prompts forecasters to update upward.
- A burst of forecasting activity where new/returning forecasters cluster **above** 12%, nudging the median up.

**What tends to produce “No” (CP ≤ 12.00%):**  
- **Inactivity** (CP stays pinned at 12.00%).  
- Mild **time-decay updating** by attentive forecasters (“8 fewer days for this to occur in 2026”), pushing slightly below 12%.  
- News that is interpreted as **posturing** or **de-escalatory diplomacy**, pushing slightly down.

**What the provided near-term news looks like (outside-view interpretation):**  
- The Wang Yi and Trump-arms-sales items are the sort of **routine rhetorical / policy churn** that often yields only **small CP noise**, not a clear systematic push above a knife-edge threshold.
- Because the threshold is exactly the current CP (12.00%), and because “equal” counts as **No**, the outside view slightly favors **No**.

Given typical short-horizon stickiness + the asymmetry that “no change” means **No**, I place the outside-view probability of CP ending **strictly above** 12.00% in **the mid-to-high 40s**, not ~50/50 or higher.

---

Outside view calibration:

- **Anchor (no structural asymmetry):** If CP were equally likely to drift up or down by small amounts over a week, we’d start near **50%** for “higher than current.”  
- **Adjustments:**
  1) **Tie/go-nowhere probability** (which maps to No) pushes below 50.  
  2) **Time-decay directionality** (weak but negative drift absent new info) pushes further below 50.  
  3) Recent headlines are not obviously of the “major crisis” type that reliably produces a sharp upward repricing within days.
- **Net:** modest tilt to **No**.

Outside View Prediction:
**44.3%**
