Analysis:
1. Source analysis (chronological, factual vs opinion)
   • Nikkei Asia (17 Feb 26): quotes President Trump saying he will “decide soon” on a new Taiwan arms package.  High-quality, timely, essentially factual reporting of a presidential remark; no direct evidence of imminent hostilities.  (Moderate).
   • BBC/AFP wires (5–17 Feb 26): summarise Xi–Trump phone call; both leaders stress prudence.  Reliable mainstream wire copy; rhetoric only.  (Weak–moderate).
   • Economist Intelligence Unit note (3 Feb 26): reviews Dec 2025 exercise “Justice Mission 2025”, assesses invasion as “unlikely”, blockade “cannot be ruled out”.  Named analytical house, clear methodology.  (Moderate evidence invasion risk is low).
   • Taipei Times (10 Feb 26): MoD statistics show PLA flight activity in Jan 26 lowest since early 24; experts caution complexity still rising.  Primary data from MoD, credible.  (Moderate evidence for slight de-escalation).
   • The Sun (18 Feb 26): reports Jan fishing-militia “blockade drill” via commercial AIS.  Sensationalist outlet; underlying AIS analysis from named researchers adds some credibility, but interpretation speculative.  (Weak–moderate).
   • AFP wire (17 Feb 26): reiterates Trump arms-sale decision “soon”.  (As above).
   • Misc. AskNews items (astrology, prophecies, etc.) – unidentifiable experts, speculative.  (Discarded).

2. Evidence analysis
   Strong: none in last week.
   Moderate (push CP down): 
     – MoD data: PLA activity at two-year low. 
     – EIU assessment: invasion “unlikely”, risk unchanged.
   Moderate (push CP up):
     – Disclosure of large January fishing-militia drill suggests blockade rehearsal.
     – Trump–Xi interaction keeps arms-sale tension alive; decision window before Trump China visit.
   Weak:
     – Routine hawkish statements at Munich Security Conf.
     – Sensational media framing.

   Net weight: roughly balanced, but de-escalatory flight trend plus passage of calendar time give a slight downward tilt.

3. Timeframe analysis
   Resolution in 8 days (18 Feb → 26 Feb 26).  Median Metaculus CPs for mature geopolitics questions typically move <±0.5 pp in a week unless a discrete crisis occurs.  Halving the window to 4 days would lower my “Yes” probability by ~3 pp; doubling to 16 days would raise it by ~4 pp.

4. Justification / inside-view adjustment
   Outside-view base rate (derived earlier): 44 %.
   Adjustments:
     – “No-change or drift-down” bias (tie counts as No): –7 pp.
     – Calendar-time decay (317→309 days remaining in 2026): –3 pp.
     – Recent data showing reduced PLA flights: –2 pp.
     – January militia drill revelations + pending US arms decision (possible mild spike in concern): +5 pp.
   Net inside-view = 44 – 7 – 3 – 2 + 5 ≈ 37 %.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Will the Metaculus community probability for ‘China attacks/blockades Taiwan in 2026’ exceed 12 % on 26 Feb 26?”  
2. Base rate recorded at 44 %.  
3. Consistency: “About 37 out of 100 times, the CP finishes above 12 %.”  
4. Key evidence:  
   – Median CPs rarely swing >0.5 pp/week without a crisis.  
   – Tie (12 %) resolves to No.  
   – PLA flight count fell to two-year low in Jan.  
   – New fishing-militia drill suggests blockade rehearsal.  
   – Trump arms-sale decision pending could raise concern.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden high-profile incident (e.g., PLA fires missiles into Taiwan’s TZ) within the next week could spike CP >15 %. Would raise probability into the 60s.  
6. Status-quo bias checked; slight nudge toward No applied.

Probability calibration
I therefore estimate a 37 % chance the community prediction is strictly greater than 12.00 % at the cutoff, and a 63 % chance it is 12.00 % or lower.

Probability: 37%
