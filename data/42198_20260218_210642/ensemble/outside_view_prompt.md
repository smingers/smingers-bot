You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 12.00% on 2026-02-26 for the Metaculus question "Will China attack or blockade Taiwan during 2026?"?

Question background:
Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. 

--------------------------------

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41139
- Original question title: Will China attack or blockade Taiwan during 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 12.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as **Yes** if during 2026, any of the following occur:
> 
> 1. China conducts a military attack on any land territory held by Taiwan.
> 2. China conducts a deliberate military attack on Taiwan's military forces or coast guard.
> 3. Most commercial ship traffic to at least one port administered by Taiwan ceases for at least 5 days due to physical actions by China.

Original fine print: 
> * To qualify, a military attack must physically affect Taiwan's land territory or military forces, cyberattacks or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.
> * The reduction of port traffic must be directly due to Chinese physical actions, cyberattacks, threats, or unrelated closures do not qualify.
> * For the purposes of this question, ports administered by Taiwan include but are not limited to ports in Penghu, Kinmen, the Matsu Islands, Green Island, Orchid Island, and Xiaoliuqiu.
> * If China gets control of any land controlled by Taiwan without Taiwan's explicit permission, this question will resolve as **Yes**.

Original background: 
> Since the end of the [Chinese Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War) and the fleeing of the [Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan) (ROC) to Taiwan, the [People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) (PRC) has attempted to gain control over the island.
> 
> During the 20th century, there were [numerous spikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Strait_Crises) in tension, with the PRC and ROC engaging in active combat during the earlier history.
> 
> In the 2010s and 2020s, tensions have ramped up once again, with repeated [PRC incursions](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-taiwan-military-nato-summit-b2577926.html) into the ROC's airspace, PRC warships [encountering](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/new-zealand-navy-encountered-taiwan-warship-during-strait-transit-last-month-2025-12-09/) ROC warships, and a reaffirming of the PRC long standing position that it may use military force to unify with the ROC.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41139) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-26 20:05:56 is higher than 12.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 12.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-26 20:05:56, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

# Summary of Article: "Record number of Chinese warplanes breach Taiwan airspace"

**Source:** The Independent  
**Date:** July 11, 2024

## Key Facts and Statistics:

1. **66 Chinese aircraft** were detected around Taiwan in a 24-hour period, with **56 of them breaching the median line of the Taiwan Strait** - described as a **single-day record for 2024**.

2. In addition to aircraft, **7 People's Liberation Army Navy vessels** were detected operating around Taiwan (up until 6 am on the day of reporting).

3. The aircraft detected included a Chinese J-16 fighter and a nuclear-capable H-6 bomber, according to pictures released by Taiwan's defense ministry.

## Context:

- The Chinese military drills coincided with a Nato summit in Washington where Western leaders issued their "strongest-ever condemnation" of Beijing for being a "decisive" enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine.

- Taiwan's defense ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang stated the military has "a detailed grasp of the activities in the seas and waters around the Taiwan Strait."

- Taiwan has complained of a "sharp uptick in Chinese military activity in recent years."

## Statements from Officials:

- **Nato** labeled China a "decisive enabler" of Putin's war in Ukraine in what was described as the alliance's strongest rebuke of Beijing.

- **Beijing's response:** Accused Nato of "smearing" China and demanded the alliance "stay out of Asia" and remain "within its role as a regional defensive organisation in the north Atlantic." Beijing also stated Nato should not become "the disrupter of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific."

- Chinese military officials have previously denounced US efforts to strengthen ties with regional allies as a plot to create an "Asian Nato."

## Additional Context:

- Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand joined the Nato summit - a practice that started after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.

- US allies in Asia, including Japan and the Philippines, have stepped up joint planning, exercises, and weapons deployments in response to growing Chinese military power.

# Summary of Article: "Will China launch a full-scale invasion of Taiwan before 2030?"

**Source:** Manifold (discussion/prediction market)

**Key Context:**
- This market resolves based on a linked Metaculus question about Chinese invasion of Taiwan
- The Metaculus definition requires at least 1,000 PLA personnel deployed to Taiwan's main island with the aim of putting it under PRC rule
- Blockades, cyberattacks, or operations limited to smaller islands (like Kinmen) do not count unless troops land on the main island

## Facts and Statistics:

**Military Capabilities:**
- China conducted its largest-ever exercise around Taiwan (Justice Mission 2025) with 89 warplanes simulating blockade operations
- Pentagon reports China made significant gains toward its 2027 modernization goals with capabilities designed for Taiwan scenarios
- PLA has only 8 Type 071 amphibious vessels; amphibious capabilities remain questionable despite improvements

**Economic Factors:**
- Taiwan produces 90%+ of the world's most advanced semiconductors
- TSMC accounts for 70% of global foundry revenue
- Economists estimate a Taiwan conflict would cost China $5-10 trillion in the first year alone
- China faces ongoing economic slowdown (weak domestic consumption, property sector fragility, youth unemployment)

**U.S. Support:**
- U.S. approved an unprecedented $11.1 billion arms package to Taiwan in December
- Trump signed $1.4 billion in additional 2026 defense funding

**Current Probabilities:**
- The Manifold market shows ~33-38% probability for full-scale invasion before 2030
- Metaculus crowd gives around 12% probability by 2028 (historically even lower for 2030)

## Expert Opinions (Named/Reliable Sources):

**CSIS Expert Survey:**
- 63% of experts consider an invasion "possible" in the next 10 years
- Only 27% of U.S. experts believe China could successfully execute an amphibious invasion given current capabilities
- 52% assess China would "deliberately escalate its use of force short of invasion" as likely/very likely
- 80% probability assigned to a highly kinetic joint blockade as the most probable near-term scenario if Beijing chooses force

**Oriana Skylar Mastro:**
- Assesses general "use of force" at nearly 100% likelihood in the next five years

**Sentinel Team Forecasters:**
- Estimated 43% chance of China attempting to invade Taiwan by 2030 (range: 20% to 70%)

## Opinions from Less Reliable/Unnamed Sources:

**"Calibrated Ghosts" (3 Claude Opus 4.6 agents):**
- Argues the 33% market probability is "significantly overconfident"
- Suggests 10-15% probability is more defensible
- Notes the market may be conflating "major Taiwan crisis" with "full-scale invasion"
- Lists five key factors suppressing invasion probability including questionable PLA capabilities, economic costs, strengthened U.S. commitment, Xi's military purges, and availability of coercive tools short of invasion

**Anonymous commenters:**
- One commenter believes Xi views Taiwan reunification as his personal responsibility, citing Xi's comment that the Taiwan issue "cannot be passed down from generation to generation"
- Another argues U.S. concessions to Russia incentivize China to attempt something similar with Taiwan
- One commenter ("Stellar Serene"/"elf") argues China will inevitably win due to largest supply of high-skilled labor, state control, and global trade integration

**Recent Developments (2026):**
- Xi Jinping declared in his New Year's address that reunification is "unstoppable"
- Xi's ongoing military purges have removed many senior officers, creating uncertainty about PLA readiness

</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve the historical daily community prediction values for Metaculus question 41139 "Will China attack or blockade Taiwan during 2026?" and summarize notable jumps since January 2025.
Objective.  The original query asks for (a) the historical daily Community Prediction (CP) series for Metaculus question #41139 “Will China attack or blockade Taiwan during 2026?” and (b) a narrative of the major probability jumps occurring since 1 Jan 2025.

What the search results give us.  
1.  None of the nine search snippets returned any table, graph, csv, or even a single numerical data-point for the CP trajectory of question #41139.  
2.  Several items (e.g., the Metaculus “bot-template” repository and “forecasting-tools” package) confirm that an authenticated Metaculus REST-API endpoint exists that exposes a question’s timeline—including the daily community prediction—but the results do not reproduce any call or output from that endpoint (GitHub, “metac-bot-template”; GitHub, “forecasting-tools”).  
3.  One forum post and one Manifold market simply paraphrase the resolution criteria and current headline percentage but again offer no historical series (EA Forum; Manifold market).  

Consequences for the query.  
•  Because no historical data points are present in the retrieved material, it is impossible to compile the requested daily CP history or to identify and quantify “notable jumps” after 1 Jan 2025.  
•  The only quantitative figure that can be cited with confidence from the search results is the current CP of 12 % on 16 Feb 2026, already supplied in the question prompt.  

Remaining information gap.  
A complete answer requires the raw timeline data that Metaculus exposes through its API at an endpoint of the form:  
https://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/41139/timeline/  
or, equivalently, via the wrapper functions contained in metaculus-python, forecasting-tools, or metac-bot-template.  The response payload returns a list of timestamped entries (each containing the community prediction, Metaculus prediction, number of forecasts, etc.).  Without that payload the historical series cannot be reconstructed.

Conclusion.  
The search results confirm that the information is publicly accessible but do not actually contain it.  Therefore:

1. Additional data are still required: the JSON timeline export (or any secondary source that has already downloaded it).  
2. Once that dataset is in hand, the analysis could proceed by:  
   •  Resampling the raw timestamps to daily frequency (taking the last CP for each date).  
   •  Computing day-on-day deltas to flag “notable jumps” (e.g., |ΔCP| ≥ 1 percentage point) since 2025-01-01.  
   •  Summarising each jump with the date, magnitude, and (optionally) a short news context.

Because the essential dataset is missing, an evidence-based chronology of jumps cannot yet be produced.</Agent_report>


The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?
