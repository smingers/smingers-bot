    "description": "Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. \n\n--------------------------------\n\nBelow are some details about the original Metaculus question: \n- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41139\n- Original question title: Will China attack or blockade Taiwan during 2026?\n- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 12.00%\n\nOriginal resolution criteria: \n> This question will resolve as **Yes** if during 2026, any of the following occur:\n> \n> 1. China conducts a military attack on any land territory held by Taiwan.\n> 2. China conducts a deliberate military attack on Taiwan's military forces or coast guard.\n> 3. Most commercial ship traffic to at least one port administered by Taiwan ceases for at least 5 days due to physical actions by China.\n\nOriginal fine print: \n> * To qualify, a military attack must physically affect Taiwan's land territory or military forces, cyberattacks or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.\n> * The reduction of port traffic must be directly due to Chinese physical actions, cyberattacks, threats, or unrelated closures do not qualify.\n> * For the purposes of this question, ports administered by Taiwan include but are not limited to ports in Penghu, Kinmen, the Matsu Islands, Green Island, Orchid Island, and Xiaoliuqiu.\n> * If China gets control of any land controlled by Taiwan without Taiwan's explicit permission, this question will resolve as **Yes**.\n\nOriginal background: \n> Since the end of the [Chinese Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War) and the fleeing of the [Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan) (ROC) to Taiwan, the [People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) (PRC) has attempted to gain control over the island.\n> \n> During the 20th century, there were [numerous spikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Strait_Crises) in tension, with the PRC and ROC engaging in active combat during the earlier history.\n> \n> In the 2010s and 2020s, tensions have ramped up once again, with repeated [PRC incursions](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-taiwan-military-nato-summit-b2577926.html) into the ROC's airspace, PRC warships [encountering](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/new-zealand-navy-encountered-taiwan-warship-during-strait-transit-last-month-2025-12-09/) ROC warships, and a reaffirming of the PRC long standing position that it may use military force to unify with the ROC.\n\n`{\"format\":\"metaculus_binary_cp_rises\",\"info\":{\"post_id\":41139,\"question_id\":40840,\"last_cp\":0.12}}`",
    "resolution_criteria": "This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41139) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-26 20:05:56 is higher than 12.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 12.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-26 20:05:56, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.",
