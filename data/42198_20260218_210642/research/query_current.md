Analysis:
The Metaculus community estimate for a 2026 Chinese attack or blockade of Taiwan sits right at 12 %. Movement in the next eight days will be driven almost entirely by any fresh evidence that raises or lowers perceived conflict risk. That evidence is most likely to come from:
• New PLA air- or sea-space incursions, large-scale exercises, or an announced “joint blockade” drill near Taiwan.
• Satellite or AIS reports of amphibious or missile units massing in Fujian, or unusual PLAN/Coast-Guard deployments.
• Beijing or Taipei leadership statements (Xi, Premier Liu, President Lai) signalling coercion, deadlines, or détente.
• U.S./allied actions—Freedom-of-Navigation transits, arms deliveries, congressional delegations—that change deterrence calculus.
• Intelligence or think-tank analyses updating invasion timelines.
Timely searches therefore have to surface same-week defence ministry communiqués, ship/plane tracking data, and expert commentary dated Feb 2026. General web search can capture think-tank briefs and satellite analyses; Google News will surface breaking wire and regional press; AskNews can pull a consolidated narrative of January-to-Feb trends with analytic context.
