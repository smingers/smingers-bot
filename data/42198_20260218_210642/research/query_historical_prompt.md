The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 12.00% on 2026-02-26 for the Metaculus question "Will China attack or blockade Taiwan during 2026?"?

Question background:
Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency.

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41139
- Original question title: Will China attack or blockade Taiwan during 2026?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 12.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as **Yes** if during 2026, any of the following occur:
> 
> 1. China conducts a military attack on any land territory held by Taiwan.
> 2. China conducts a deliberate military attack on Taiwan's military forces or coast guard.
> 3. Most commercial ship traffic to at least one port administered by Taiwan ceases for at least 5 days due to physical actions by China.

Original fine print: 
> * To qualify, a military attack must physically affect Taiwan's land territory or military forces, cyberattacks or other actions without immediate physical impact will not count.
> * The reduction of port traffic must be directly due to Chinese physical actions, cyberattacks, threats, or unrelated closures do not qualify.
> * For the purposes of this question, ports administered by Taiwan include but are not limited to ports in Penghu, Kinmen, the Matsu Islands, Green Island, Orchid Island, and Xiaoliuqiu.
> * If China gets control of any land controlled by Taiwan without Taiwan's explicit permission, this question will resolve as **Yes**.

Original background: 
> Since the end of the [Chinese Civil War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chinese_Civil_War) and the fleeing of the [Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan) (ROC) to Taiwan, the [People's Republic of China](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/China) (PRC) has attempted to gain control over the island.
> 
> During the 20th century, there were [numerous spikes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiwan_Strait_Crises) in tension, with the PRC and ROC engaging in active combat during the earlier history.
> 
> In the 2010s and 2020s, tensions have ramped up once again, with repeated [PRC incursions](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/asia/china-taiwan-military-nato-summit-b2577926.html) into the ROC's airspace, PRC warships [encountering](https://www.reuters.com/world/china/new-zealand-navy-encountered-taiwan-warship-during-strait-transit-last-month-2025-12-09/) ROC warships, and a reaffirming of the PRC long standing position that it may use military force to unify with the ROC.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/41139) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-26 20:05:56 is higher than 12.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 12.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-26 20:05:56, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

IMPORTANT: Today's date is 2026-02-18. All dates before today's date are in the PAST. All dates after today's date are in the FUTURE. Use today's date to correctly evaluate whether sources describe past events or future predictions. Any information source which refers to events before today's date of 2026-02-18 should not be considered as speculative but rather an historical document.

Your task is to analyze the forecasting question and write search queries to find relevant historical context. For each query, indicate whether to use Google, Google News, or Agent.

For Google/Google News:
Google and Google News use keyword search. Write short queries (max six words) using terms likely to appear on relevant web pages.

For Agent:
Your query will be processed by a reasoning model with web search capability. You may write a detailed, multi-part query of up to three sentences.

For FRED:
If the question involves economic or financial data, add a FRED query. Use a plain-language description (e.g., "US unemployment rate") or a FRED series ID (e.g., "UNRATE"). Returns historical data with computed statistics.

Format your answer exactly as below, with the source in parentheses () on the same line after each query. Do not wrap your query in quotes or brackets. Include one Google query, one Google News query, and one Agent query.

Analysis:
{Your initial impression/analysis of the forecasting question followed by reasoning about the most relevant historical context needed to generate an outside view.}

Search queries:
1. your query here (Google)
2. your query here (Google News)
3. your query here (Agent)
4. economic indicator query (FRED) -- only if question involves economic/financial data
