The article notes a series of global disasters in early 2026, including a major earthquake in Myanmar, severe tornadoes in the U.S. Midwest, floods in Southeast Asia, ongoing conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East, India-Pakistan, and Thailand-Cambodia, and internal unrest in Iran. Metaphysician Wang Fajia interpreted the 'Fire Earth Jin' hexagram, symbolizing progress accompanied by challenges, suggesting intensified competition between the U.S. and China in technology, economy, and ideology, but also the need for balance and restraint to avoid escalation in geopolitical, trade, and tech domains. The 'Jin' (progress) aspect indicates that cooperation on global issues remains possible. Metaphysician Yun Wenz\u01d0 predicted a new 'fragile balance' in U.S.-China relations, with increased tensions but potential for limited consensus. He analyzed China's economic outlook through the 'Tianpeng Star' with 'Hekui' and 'Zhuque', indicating ongoing export pressure from trade wars and persistent industrial overcapacity, leading to continued deflationary pressures. However, the Greater Bay Area is seen as a positive force due to 'Zhuque' in position, expected to drive China's economic, technological, and social integration, especially in high-tech and financial services, with enhanced regional cooperation and resource flow. Regarding conflicts, metaphysician Qi Xianyu stated that the Russia-Ukraine war will remain unresolved despite temporary ceasefires. The Taiwan Strait remains tense but is unlikely to erupt into war. Metaphysician Li Chengze predicted the 'Fire Heaven Day You' hexagram, indicating ongoing warfare, particularly in southern and northwestern regions, with countries having solar symbols or red-white flags at higher risk. On natural disasters, Li Chengze's 'Heaven Mountain Dun' hexagram suggests rising temperatures and melting ice could lead to severe flooding, particularly in low-lying areas. Qi Xianyu warned of a high risk of severe flooding in Thailand and Indonesia, potential outbreaks of epidemics in South Asia (noting India\u2019s Nipah virus case), and a likelihood of a major aviation disaster involving a large airline in the south, especially during winter. Travelers are advised to avoid southern and northwestern regions and consider eastern destinations instead.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 05:35 PM\nSource:[on.cc\u6771\u7db2](https://hk.on.cc/hk/bkn/cnt/news/20260219/bkn-20260219010055745-0219_00822_001.html)\n\n**Moment THOUSANDS of Chinese fishing boats line up in 'Taiwan blockade drill'**\nChina conducted a large-scale maritime drill in January 2026, mobilizing approximately 1,400 fishing vessels in the East China Sea over a four-day period from January 9 to January 12, forming dense, coordinated wall-like or L-shaped formations stretching at least 200 miles. The operation, revealed through ship-tracking data analyzed by Jason Wang of IngeniSpace and Mark Douglas of Starboard, was described as unprecedented in scale and discipline, with analysts noting the high level of command and control over civilian ships. The exercise is believed to have tested the ability of China\u2019s maritime militia\u2014composed of state-controlled fishing fleet personnel with military training\u2014to execute a 'gray-zone' blockade, potentially used to restrict shipping, enforce a quarantine, or exert pressure on Taiwan. The drill followed two days of joint military exercises involving the PLA army, navy, and air force around Taiwan, which the PLA claimed created a 'shield of justice' surrounding five major ports. Experts, including Gregory Poling of CSIS, suggest the maneuver was a rehearsal for future contingency operations, such as a blockade or quarantine. The event occurred shortly after a similar unannounced drill in late December 2025. China has not publicly acknowledged the fishing vessel mobilization. Professor Steve Tsang of SOAS China Institute predicted a Chinese invasion of Taiwan by 2037, citing escalating military readiness.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 10:43 AM\nSource:[The Sun](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/38258482/chilling-moment-thousands-of-civilian-chinese-fishing-boats-line-up-in-huge-formation-in-taiwan-blockade-drill/)\n\n**Global Experts Predict 2036: As U.S. Dominance Fades, Taiwan May Become the Spark of Third World War**\nA survey conducted by the Atlantic Council gathered insights from 447 top experts across government, think tanks, academia, and the private sector from 72 countries. According to the findings, 63% of experts believe the world in 2036 will be worse than the current situation. This reflects the anticipated collapse of the U.S.-led unipolar order into a chaotic 'age of disorder' marked by the dramatic shift in the balance of power between the United States and China. Only 7% of respondents believe the U.S. will maintain unipolar dominance by 2036, while 90% predict a move toward a 'bipolar' or 'multipolar' global structure.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 08:43 AM\nSource:[\u98a8\u50b3\u5a92](https://www.storm.mg/article/11104401)\n\n**Bloomberg Exposes War Cost: Global Economy Could Lose $332.55 Trillion Over Taiwan Conflict**\nAccording to a deep research report by Bloomberg published on February 18, 2026, a military conflict over Taiwan between the U.S. and China would result in an estimated $10.6 trillion (approximately NT$332.55 trillion) in global economic losses within the first year of war\u2014equivalent to 9.6% of global GDP. This impact would surpass both the 2008 financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic. The report highlights that Taiwan produces 62% of the world\u2019s most advanced semiconductors, with TSMC controlling 70% of global wafer fabrication revenue. A conflict would disrupt supply chains for tech giants like Apple, Nvidia, and Qualcomm, affecting smartphones, automobiles, and AI data centers. Additionally, the Taiwan Strait\u2014carrying one-fifth of global maritime trade\u2014would likely be blocked, halting global commerce. The study projects that China\u2019s GDP would drop by 11%, the U.S. by 6.6%, South Korea by 23%, and Japan by 14.7%. Taiwan itself would suffer catastrophic economic collapse due to infrastructure damage and total blockade of sea lanes, threatening years of democratic and economic progress. Bloomberg warns that the four pillars maintaining the current Taiwan Strait status quo\u2014U.S. military superiority, Beijing\u2019s strategic patience, Taipei\u2019s identity balance, and cross-strait economic ties\u2014are eroding. China now has the world\u2019s largest navy and is rapidly advancing in stealth fighters and hypersonic missiles, aiming for a larger submarine fleet by 2030\u20132035. In contrast, U.S. military deterrence along the First Island Chain faces challenges due to long supply lines and limited anti-satellite capabilities. The report also criticizes the Kuomintang (KMT) for opposing defense budget increases and favoring closer ties with Beijing, while public opinion in Taiwan leans toward social welfare over military expansion and resists conscription. This limits the ability of President Lai Ching-te\u2019s administration to prepare for conflict. The article notes that U.S. political developments, including Donald Trump\u2019s suggestion that Taiwan should pay a 'security fee' and question whether the U.S. should defend Taiwan, create uncertainty. With Trump allies gaining influence in the Republican-controlled Congress, future U.S. legislative support for Taiwan\u2019s defense may weaken.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 05:45 AM\nSource:[\u4e09\u7acb\u65b0\u805e](https://www.setn.com/News.aspx)\n\n**Metaculus Launches FutureEval to Track AI Forecasting Accuracy**\nMetaculus, a forecasting platform and public benefit corporation, has launched FutureEval, a continuously updated benchmark that measures the accuracy of AI systems in predicting real-world events and compares their performance against elite human forecasters. Unlike static reasoning tests, FutureEval evaluates probabilistic forecasts across domains such as science, technology, health, geopolitics, and AI, using questions with unknown outcomes to prevent test-set contamination and ensure real-world relevance. The benchmark consists of three components: the Model Leaderboard, which tests major AI models using standardized prompts and tracks performance trends; Bot Tournaments, where developers compete for $175,000 in annual prizes; and Human Baselines derived from predictions by the Metaculus community and Pro Forecasters. As of February 2026, humans still outperform AI, but projections indicate AI systems could surpass the broader Metaculus community by April 2026 and Pro Forecasters by mid-2027. According to Metaculus CEO Deger Turan, 'AI models are not better than the pros yet, but they're progressing fast enough that we need to prepare for a world where they are.' AI Research Engineer Ben Wilson emphasized that 'if AI can forecast as well as humans, that is a big deal, impacting decision-making across business, finance, marketing, law, and more,' but stressed the need to determine when AI forecasts can be trusted. FutureEval offers advantages over existing benchmarks by measuring decision-relevant forecasting ability, resisting training contamination, avoiding saturation through increasing question difficulty, and using probabilistic scoring to assess accuracy, calibration, and discrimination. It also identifies where AI and human forecasts diverge, helping organizations understand when and how AI forecasting capabilities can be reliably integrated.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 02:22 AM\nSource:[GlobeNewswire Press Releases](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/02/18/3239902/0/en/Metaculus-Launches-FutureEval-to-Track-AI-Forecasting-Accuracy.html)\n\n**Baba Vanga 2026 Prediction: Will There Be a World War This Year?**\nIn February 2026, viral social media content and articles resurfaced claims that Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga predicted a third world war beginning in 2026, citing escalating geopolitical tensions between the United States, Russia, and China, as well as conflicts in Ukraine, the Middle East, and Taiwan. However, experts and fact-checkers emphasize that most attributed quotes from Vanga\u2014 who died in 1996\u2014lack verifiable sources and originate from second-hand or unverified accounts. The predictions are considered ambiguous and subject to multiple interpretations, with similar claims having circulated for years without evidence. While 2026 features ongoing military standoffs in Eurasia, regional wars, and economic competition among major powers, official government and international organizations have not indicated any imminent threat of World War III. The widespread interest in Vanga\u2019s alleged prophecy is attributed to cultural fascination with apocalyptic narratives and online virality, not empirical evidence. Experts caution that such claims should be viewed as folklore rather than factual forecasts.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 08:42 AM\nSource:[The Sunday Guardian Live](https://sundayguardianlive.com/trending/baba-vanga-2026-prediction-will-there-be-a-world-war-this-year-170870/)\n\n**Ko Wen-je's Imprisonment Fate in 2026: Astrologer Predicts Blue, Green, and White Party Fortunes for the Year of the Horse**\nThe 2026 'Hundred County Magistrates' (Bai Li Hou) race has already begun, signaling a potential major reshuffling of Taiwan's political landscape. Renowned folk expert Yang Dengkong made striking predictions on the political talk show 'Jingbao Xinxwenxian,' analyzing the 2026 fortunes of the three major parties using five-element metaphysics. He predicted that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) may gain control of strong Kuomintang (KMT) voter bases, and warned that the KMT could lose another of its six major cities in the upcoming election. Regarding former Taiwan People's Party (TPP) chairman Ko Wen-je, who is embroiled in controversy and facing a verdict on March 26, 2026, Yang Dengkong offered a new prophecy on whether Ko will 'go back to jail' this year.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 02:14 AM\nSource:[\u98a8\u50b3\u5a92](https://www.storm.mg/lifestyle/11104213)\n\n**Trump to decide 'soon' on sending weapons to Taiwan**\nUS President Donald Trump stated on February 17, 2026, that he would soon decide whether to send additional weapons to Taiwan, following a warning from Chinese President Xi Jinping. In a phone call on February 4, 2026, Xi emphasized that the Taiwan question is the most important issue in China-US relations and urged the US to handle arms sales to Taiwan with caution, stressing 'mutual respect' in bilateral ties. According to China's state broadcaster, Xi reiterated that Taiwan is part of China, a claim Beijing maintains despite never having ruled the island, which has a population of 23 million and operates as a self-governing democracy. The US does not officially recognize Taiwan but remains its primary military backer, though support has slightly softened under Trump. The US approved $11 billion in arms sales to Taiwan in December 2025, prompting China to conduct major live-fire drills simulating a blockade around Taiwan's key ports. Trump confirmed he is in ongoing discussions with Xi and expects to make a decision 'pretty soon,' citing a 'good relationship' with the Chinese leader.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 01:10 AM\nSource:[AFP](http://doc.afp.com/97TA3ZQ)\n\n**Yang Dengke's Forecast: Ko Wen-je Likely to Return to Prison, DPP Aims for Three to Four Seats in 2026 Local Elections**\nFeng shui expert Yang Dengke predicted political outcomes for the 2026 Taiwan county and city mayor elections based on Chinese metaphysics. He stated that the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) has a high likelihood of securing three seats and potentially four, citing favorable annual\u8fd0\u52bf (fortune) due to the wood element (green) being strengthened by fire. In contrast, the Kuomintang (KMT), associated with the water element (blue), faces risks if internal unity is lacking, with Yang warning that 'lack of cohesion guarantees defeat.' Regarding the People Power Party (PPP), he said its white color corresponds to metal, which is weakened by the strong fire of the year, creating pressure. He revealed he prepared a 'Wen-Zhe General' talisman to protect former party chair Ko Wen-je, who is under legal scrutiny. Yang predicted Ko would 'go back to jail' again due to ongoing legal issues and the fact that he is in his 'year of conflict with the zodiac' (snake) and his name contains a 'knife' character, implying political danger. He also noted that current party chair Huang Kuo-chang lacks political protection and may be entangled in lawsuits. For the 2026 election, Yang forecasted that the DPP could win or challenge in Hsinchu County, Yilan County, Changhua County, and Chiayi City, while the KMT might lose one of its four current metropolitan cities. These predictions are based on metaphysical interpretations, and the final results remain to be confirmed by actual voting.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 11:17 PM\nSource:[ETtoday\u65b0\u805e\u96f2](https://www.ettoday.net/news/20260217/3119819.htm)\n\n**Taiwan's GDP Growth Aims to Break 34-Year Record Amid Rising Foreign Optimism and AI-Driven Economic Revival**\nForeign financial institutions are increasingly optimistic about Taiwan's economic outlook for 2026, with forecasts rising from an initial 4% to over 8% growth. DBS Bank's economist Ma Tieying initially raised Taiwan's 2026 GDP forecast to 4.8% and projected sustained leadership over other Asian 'Four Little Dragons' such as Hong Kong, Singapore, and South Korea. In February, UBS upgraded its forecast to 6.9%, citing Taiwan's emergence as 'the strongest-growing economy in Asia,' and projected potential growth of over 8.5% if productivity accelerates due to AI development. Bank of America further raised its 2026 GDP forecast to 8%, citing strong global demand for Taiwan's tech hardware, stable exchange rates, and a U.S.-Taiwan trade agreement. This surge marks a reversal of the 'East Rise, West Fall' trend, where Taiwan's economy is now outpacing mainland China's. After experiencing a slowdown in the 2000s due to industrial relocation to China, Taiwan's economy rebounded in 2023 with an 8.68% growth rate, and if sustained in 2026, it would break a 34-year record. The turnaround is attributed to heightened U.S.-China trade tensions, supply chain diversification, and the AI boom driving broad-based economic expansion.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 16, 2026 10:35 PM\nSource:[\u81ea\u7531\u6642\u5831\u96fb\u5b50\u5831](https://ec.ltn.com.tw/article/breakingnews/5344683)\n\n**False Alarm**\nThe Nine Papers' 2023 'Red Alert' series predicted a potential war between Australia and China within three years, based on the assumption that the People's Republic of China (PRC) could successfully invade Taiwan without U.S. or allied intervention by 2027\u2014the so-called 'Davidson window.' However, as of February 2026, no war has occurred, and Australia-China relations are significantly improved compared to previous years. The article identifies the primary error in the prediction: an unwarranted assumption that the PRC could achieve a successful seaborne invasion of Taiwan, disregarding historical precedents of such operations, which are overwhelmingly marked by failure. The analysis highlights that the D-Day landings, the only comparable historical success, required a force vastly superior to the current PRC capabilities. The collapse of Russia\u2019s Black Sea Fleet during the Ukraine war further undermines the feasibility of a large-scale amphibious assault, as Ukraine, with no navy, drove Russian naval forces from the Black Sea. China\u2019s limited amphibious capacity\u2014only a dozen modern amphibious assault ships capable of carrying roughly 10,000 troops, with only one or two added annually\u2014further weakens the invasion scenario. Additionally, China\u2019s reliance on dual-use civilian ferries for amphibious operations is progressing slowly. Meanwhile, Taiwan has adapted to the lessons of the Ukraine war by shifting military spending toward missile and drone defenses, including the domestically produced Hsiung Feng III missile with a 400km range, significantly exceeding the width of the Taiwan Strait. This has made any invasion attempt highly risky. As a result, most analysts have abandoned the 2027 invasion timeline, instead considering alternatives like blockade or 'quarantine,' which are deemed ineffective. A major unforeseen development is Donald Trump\u2019s re-election and his 'Donroe doctrine,' which prioritizes dominance in the Americas and suggests he would not commit U.S. forces to defend Taiwan. This reduces the likelihood of U.S. intervention, making a war with China even more remote for Australia. Consequently, AUKUS\u2019s strategic foundation\u2014joint defense under U.S. command\u2014has eroded; Australia and the UK now offer only limited support (e.g., surplus equipment and moral backing), with the UK scaling back its Indo-Pacific presence and abandoning its last permanent base east of Suez. The article concludes by expressing skepticism that Nine Papers will revisit or revise its failed forecast, and expresses surprise if their coverage of U.S.-China-Australia relations changes accordingly.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 09:30 AM\nSource:[John Quiggin](https://johnquiggin.com/2026/02/04/false-alarm/)\n\n**NYT Columnist Questions U.S. Defense of Taiwan Amid Rising Invasion Risks and Low Domestic Readiness**\nNew York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof, in an article published on January 18, 2026, stated that a report estimates a 30% probability of China invading Taiwan within the next five years. He identifies two potential early signs of such an invasion: a public call for blood donations and the relocation of assets out of Western countries to avoid freezing. Kristof expresses confusion over Taiwan\u2019s apparent lack of concern compared to Ukraine\u2019s strong resistance against Russia, questioning why the U.S. should risk lives and spend billions to defend a population seemingly unwilling to make significant sacrifices. He notes that while Taiwan\u2019s military leaders focus on 'gray zone' actions\u2014such as maritime isolation, requiring ships to stop in Xiamen for customs checks, and potential energy blockades\u2014these measures are already challenging Taiwan\u2019s security, especially given its limited natural gas reserves (only 2\u20133 weeks of supply). The report cited by Kristof, from Australia\u2019s Taiwan Strait Risk Report, also forecasts a 60% chance of China imposing aerial and maritime blockades on Taiwan within five years. He argues that despite Taiwan\u2019s efforts to increase defense spending and extend conscription from four to twelve months, these measures are insufficient. Kristof calls for a U.S. foreign policy strategy that deters China through cooperation with allies like Japan and South Korea, focusing not only on preventing invasion but also on countering gray-zone pressure. He criticizes Taiwan\u2019s lack of societal consensus, citing political infighting and public apathy, and contrasts it with nations like Estonia, Israel, Poland, and South Korea, which demonstrate strong resolve in the face of existential threats. He ends with a rhetorical question: 'Why should Americans risk their lives and spend tens of billions to defend a people who are clearly not willing to make major sacrifices?'\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 18, 2026 07:01 AM\nSource:[\u4e2d\u6642\u65b0\u805e\u7db2](https://www.chinatimes.com/realtimenews/20260118001936-260408)\n\n**2026: Predictions of Global Earthquakes, War, and Collapse\u2014Taiwan Not on List, but at Risk from Typhoons**\nThe article, published on January 11, 2026, by the website 'Kan Zhongguo' and presented by host Qiw\u00e9n, discusses a series of apocalyptic and geopolitical predictions for 2026, drawing on claims from multiple self-proclaimed prophets and seers. It asserts that American prophet Parker predicted a 'gas cloud disaster' linked to underwater volcanic activity or secret weapon tests, which could trigger war around Taiwan, China, and Japan, potentially leading to a major air disaster. The same prediction is said to align with Thai seer Ploy\u2019s forecast of a catastrophic 'air disaster' in early 2026, particularly affecting countries starting with H, J, and T\u2014interpreted as Hong Kong, Japan, and Taiwan. Parker also predicted a massive cyberattack causing global chaos and economic collapse, with China as the primary target, leading to the fall of the Chinese Communist Party and the emergence of a new, democratic, EU-like political structure in China by 2030. Teen prophet Anand predicted a major terrorist attack in China\u2019s northwest or northeast, with heightened risks in April, July, and November 2026, and also warned of instability in the Philippines, South Korea, and North Korea. American psychic Judy Hevenly predicted that Taiwan would not be on the list of regions at risk for major earthquakes (6.0\u20137.2 magnitude or higher), which includes cities like New York, Los Angeles, Tokyo, and Manila, but warned that Taiwan faces significant danger from strong typhoons rather than land-based seismic events. The article concludes by encouraging viewers to subscribe and support the channel, while emphasizing the need for vigilance in 2026 due to the predicted convergence of political, military, and natural disasters.

Tsai Shang-ji's 2026 Prediction Resurfaces After Trump's Attack on Venezuela**\nOn January 4, 2026, U.S. President Donald Trump confirmed that U.S. military forces launched a military attack on Venezuela, sparking widespread online discussion. A viral social media post referenced predictions made by Taiwanese astrologer Tsai Shang-ji in a December 24, 2024 article titled '2026 Global & Taiwan Fortune Prediction' published on China Times Online. In the article, Tsai predicted: 'The world may face new or ongoing conflicts, such as Trump possibly launching war against Venezuela\u2014located in the southern sector, symbolizing the 'Five Yellow Double Demons'\u2014leading to fire and bloodshed, and further disrupting international economic and trade order.' Tsai also warned of heightened economic and military tensions between the U.S. and China, increasing military tensions in East Asia, and political instability in Taiwan. Regarding Taiwan\u2019s 2026 local elections, Tsai predicted that a potential Blue-White coalition could erode the Green Party\u2019s political base, but cautioned that such cooperation might not carry over to the 2028 presidential election, possibly triggering a 'pendulum effect' that could ultimately benefit the Green Party\u2019s prospects in 2028. The article was published by SETN.com, a news outlet in Taiwan.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 04, 2026 04:55 AM\nSource:[\u4e09\u7acb\u65b0\u805e](https://www.setn.com/News.aspx?NewsID=1776101)\n\n**From the Taiwan Strait to Cyberspace: The U.S. Faces 'Low-Intensity Multi-Front Pressure'**\nIn late 2025, the United States and its allies face a multifaceted, low-intensity pressure campaign across military, cyber, technological, public health, and climate domains, according to reports from the Daily Mail and the Mirror. This pressure is characterized by sustained, incremental challenges rather than full-scale war. A key flashpoint is the Taiwan Strait, where China conducted 'Justice Mission 2025' military exercises shortly after the U.S. approved a $11 billion arms sale to Taiwan, heightening regional tensions. The exercises, interpreted as simulating control of key nodes and blockades, have triggered broader regional reactions: Japanese Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi warned that a Chinese attack on Taiwan could threaten Japan's national survival, while Chinese state media questioned Japan's sovereignty over Okinawa, escalating Sino-Japanese tensions. U.S. strategic analysts view this as part of a coordinated strategy by China to test the limits of the U.S.-Japan alliance through layered friction, legal challenges, and information warfare. Brazilian prognosticator Athos Salom\u00e9, dubbed a 'real-life Nostradamus,' aligns with experts in predicting a shift toward prolonged, low-intensity conflict involving phased blockades, cyberattacks, financial pressure, semiconductor supply disruptions, and information warfare\u2014aimed not at quick victory but at eroding adversary resilience and expanding de facto control. Cyber threats are a growing domestic risk in the U.S., with the Daily Mail citing Salom\u00e9's forecast that targeted attacks on critical infrastructure\u2014such as energy, water, urban communications, and financial systems\u2014will intensify in 2026. North America and Western Europe are identified as high-risk zones. Major international events like the 2026 U.S.-Mexico World Cup could be exploited to generate social panic and political pressure. Meanwhile, ongoing instability in West Africa\u2014highlighted by the UN Security Council\u2019s December 2025 report on rising violence in Burkina Faso, Mali, and Niger\u2014threatens to cause refugee flows, food crises, and regional instability, which could indirectly impact U.S. foreign policy and security commitments.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 29, 2025 02:59 PM\nSource:[\u770b\u4e2d\u56fd](https://www.secretchina.com/news/b5/2025/12/29/1092716.html)\n\n**Cai Shangji's 2026 Global and Taiwan Outlook: A Forecast of Chaos, AI, and Geopolitical Tensions**\nThe article '\u8521\u4e0a\u6a5f2026\u570b\u969b\uff06\u53f0\u7063\u904b\u52e2\u5927\u9810\u8a00' (Cai Shangji's 2026 International & Taiwan Outlook Prediction) presents a comprehensive astrological and metaphysical forecast for 2026, based on Chinese zodiac, Ziwei Dou Shu (Purple Star Astrology), and symbolic interpretations. It predicts that 2026, the Year of Bing Wu (Water Horse), will be marked by intense global instability, with the 'Five Yellow Double Demons' and 'Sha Qi' (harmful energies) concentrated in the South, Northwest, and East. The year is described as a 'century of deception' involving widespread fraud, chaos, and geopolitical conflict, particularly between the U.S. (in the Northwest) and China (in the East), with heightened tensions in the Taiwan Strait. AI and automation are expected to cause massive job displacement, labeled as the 'Year of AI Automation Shock,' with potential 'AI bubble' risks due to supply-demand gaps. The article warns of global disasters, including natural disasters and pandemics, especially in the South, East, and Northwest. It identifies Donald Trump (born 1946, Bing Xu year) as a potential 'new axis of evil' due to his 'Lianzhen Star with Forbidden Star' configuration, suggesting he may destabilize global order. For Taiwan, the year is seen as both a high-opportunity and high-risk period: Taiwan's semiconductor and AI technological dominance is expected to boost its global economic importance, potentially making 'Taiwan issues' synonymous with global economic collapse. However, Taiwan faces extreme geopolitical risk, especially in the 'Taiwan Strait's terrifying balance' between U.S. and China. The domestic political landscape is predicted to be highly polarized, with the 2026 nine-in-one elections likely to trigger intense political warfare. Economically, Taiwan is expected to remain resilient due to its tech production, but Trump's 'Forbidden Star' in Taiwan's financial palace may hinder economic growth. The stock market is forecasted to experience a 'feed,\u5957, kill' (feed, trap, kill) cycle, with AI and tech stocks vulnerable to overvaluation and sudden crashes. Health risks include cardiovascular diseases and cancer. Real estate will see a 'three homes, one support' trend, with luxury and tech-oriented properties rising while others struggle. Socially, the article warns of increased fraud, cybercrime, mental health issues, and violent crimes, including 'terrorist lovers' and AI deepfake scams.

Fortune-Teller Reveals Key Factor Is 'Xi Jinping' and Criticizes Beijing's Hong Kong Management**\nAccording to the article published on December 3, 2025, by SETN.com, political analyst and fortune-teller Zhou Yingjun, known for her accurate prediction of Ko Wen-je's failure to win the 2024 presidential election, stated that she believes there will be no war in the Taiwan Strait in 2026. However, she emphasized that the final decision rests with Xi Jinping, stating, 'I'm not Xi Jinping, how would I know if he wants to fight?' Zhou questioned the strategic value of Taiwan for China, arguing that China already has Hong Kong and that the real advantage of Taiwan lies in its people, not its land. She criticized China's management of Hong Kong, saying, 'They took Hong Kong back but didn\u2019t manage it well.' Zhou described the threat of war as a 'strategic maneuver' by Beijing, asserting that Taiwan is being used as a pawn by the US and China. Regarding the 2026 stock market, she predicted that the year will be a 'fire' year (Bing Wu), which could lead to economic instability, investor anxiety, and possible market corrections or bursting of inflated bubbles. She warned investors to remain cautious, especially those holding large stock positions, due to the high current market levels.

The publication warns that if U.S. support for Taiwan weakens, Beijing may act, despite the vast military imbalance: China\u2019s defense spending accounts for 12% of global total, while Taiwan\u2019s is only 0.8%. Although the combined military spending of U.S., Japan, and South Korea exceeds China\u2019s, The Economist notes that Beijing might prioritize a blockade over invasion due to lower economic and military costs, though this still risks U.S. military intervention and economic retaliation. In South Asia, nuclear-armed India (180 warheads) and Pakistan (170 warheads) remain at high risk, especially over unresolved Kashmir border disputes. A deadly 2025 April attack in India that killed 26 tourists triggered a cross-border conflict resulting in over 50 deaths, with tensions rising despite recent de-escalation. India\u2019s rapid economic growth is widening its conventional military advantage, while Pakistan\u2019s army chief, Asim Munir, consolidates power. The U.S., traditionally a mediator, has strained relations with India due to trade tariffs, and both nations have abandoned past restraint. In Eastern Europe, the Russia-Ukraine war has entered a brutal attrition phase, with Russian casualties exceeding U.S. WWII totals. Since December 2022, Russia has gained only 1.3% more Ukrainian territory. The Economist predicts 2026 will bring slow progress, stalemate, or a negotiated settlement. The analysis emphasizes that strategic resources and leaders\u2019 ambitions will be key drivers of global crises by 2026.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: November 25, 2025 06:45 AM\nSource:[\u98a8\u50b3\u5a92](https://www.storm.mg/article/11083463)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
