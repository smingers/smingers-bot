In addition to aircraft, **7 People's Liberation Army Navy vessels** were detected operating around Taiwan (up until 6 am on the day of reporting).\n\n3. The aircraft detected included a Chinese J-16 fighter and a nuclear-capable H-6 bomber, according to pictures released by Taiwan's defense ministry.\n\n## Context:\n\n- The Chinese military drills coincided with a Nato summit in Washington where Western leaders issued their \"strongest-ever condemnation\" of Beijing for being a \"decisive\" enabler of Russia's war against Ukraine.\n\n- Taiwan's defense ministry spokesperson Sun Li-fang stated the military has \"a detailed grasp of the activities in the seas and waters around the Taiwan Strait.\"\n\n- Taiwan has complained of a \"sharp uptick in Chinese military activity in recent years.\"\n\n## Statements from Officials:\n\n- **Nato** labeled China a \"decisive enabler\" of Putin's war in Ukraine in what was described as the alliance's strongest rebuke of Beijing.\n\n- **Beijing's response:** Accused Nato of \"smearing\" China and demanded the alliance \"stay out of Asia\" and remain \"within its role as a regional defensive organisation in the north Atlantic.\" Beijing also stated Nato should not become \"the disrupter of peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific.\"\n\n- Chinese military officials have previously denounced US efforts to strengthen ties with regional allies as a plot to create an \"Asian Nato.\"\n\n## Additional Context:\n\n- Japan, South Korea, Australia, and New Zealand joined the Nato summit - a practice that started after Russia's 2022 invasion of Ukraine.\n\n- US allies in Asia, including Japan and the Philippines, have stepped up joint planning, exercises, and weapons deployments in response to growing Chinese military power.\n</QuestionSource>\n\n\n<Summary source=\"https://manifold.markets/MetaculusBot/will-china-launch-a-fullscale-invas\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Will China launch a full-scale invasion of Taiwan before 2030?\"\n\n**Source:** Manifold (discussion/prediction market)\n\n**Key Context:**\n- This market resolves based on a linked Metaculus question about Chinese invasion of Taiwan\n- The Metaculus definition requires at least 1,000 PLA personnel deployed to Taiwan's main island with the aim of putting it under PRC rule\n- Blockades, cyberattacks, or operations limited to smaller islands (like Kinmen) do not count unless troops land on the main island\n\n## Facts and Statistics:\n\n**Military Capabilities:**\n- China conducted its largest-ever exercise around Taiwan (Justice Mission 2025) with 89 warplanes simulating blockade operations\n- Pentagon reports China made significant gains toward its 2027 modernization goals with capabilities designed for Taiwan scenarios\n- PLA has only 8 Type 071 amphibious vessels; amphibious capabilities remain questionable despite improvements\n\n**Economic Factors:**\n- Taiwan produces 90%+ of the world's most advanced semiconductors\n- TSMC accounts for 70% of global foundry revenue\n- Economists estimate a Taiwan conflict would cost China $5-10 trillion in the first year alone\n- China faces ongoing economic slowdown (weak domestic consumption, property sector fragility, youth unemployment)\n\n**U.S. Support:**\n- U.S. approved an unprecedented $11.1 billion arms package to Taiwan in December\n- Trump signed $1.4 billion in additional 2026 defense funding\n\n**Current Probabilities:**\n- The Manifold market shows ~33-38% probability for full-scale invasion before 2030\n- Metaculus crowd gives around 12% probability by 2028 (historically even lower for 2030)\n\n## Expert Opinions (Named/Reliable Sources):\n\n**CSIS Expert Survey:**\n- 63% of experts consider an invasion \"possible\" in the next 10 years\n- Only 27% of U.S. experts believe China could successfully execute an amphibious invasion given current capabilities\n- 52% assess China would \"deliberately escalate its use of force short of invasion\" as likely/very likely\n- 80% probability assigned to a highly kinetic joint blockade as the most probable near-term scenario if Beijing chooses force\n\n**Oriana Skylar Mastro:**\n- Assesses general \"use of force\" at nearly 100% likelihood in the next five years\n\n**Sentinel Team Forecasters:**\n- Estimated 43% chance of China attempting to invade Taiwan by 2030 (range: 20% to 70%)\n\n## Opinions from Less Reliable/Unnamed Sources:\n\n**\"Calibrated Ghosts\" (3 Claude Opus 4.6 agents):**\n- Argues the 33% market probability is \"significantly overconfident\"\n- Suggests 10-15% probability is more defensible\n- Notes the market may be conflating \"major Taiwan crisis\" with \"full-scale invasion\"\n- Lists five key factors suppressing invasion probability including questionable PLA capabilities, economic costs, strengthened U.S. commitment, Xi's military purges, and availability of coercive tools short of invasion\n\n**Anonymous commenters:**\n- One commenter believes Xi views Taiwan reunification as his personal responsibility, citing Xi's comment that the Taiwan issue \"cannot be passed down from generation to generation\"\n- Another argues U.S. concessions to Russia incentivize China to attempt something similar with Taiwan\n- One commenter (\"Stellar Serene\"/\"elf\") argues China will inevitably win due to largest supply of high-skilled labor, state control, and global trade integration\n\n**Recent Developments (2026):**\n- Xi Jinping declared in his New Year's address that reunification is \"unstoppable\"\n- Xi's ongoing military purges have removed many senior officers, creating uncertainty about PLA readiness\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary

source=\"https://asia.nikkei.com/politics/international-relations/taiwan-tensions/trump-to-decide-on-taiwan-arms-sales-soon-as-china-trip-looms\">\n# Article Summary: Trump to decide on Taiwan arms sales 'soon' as China trip looms\n\n**Source:** Nikkei Asia  \n**Date:** February 17, 2026 (Updated February 17, 2026 16:51 JST)\n\n## Key Facts:\n\n1. **Trump's Statement on Arms Sales:** U.S. President Donald Trump stated his administration will decide on weapons sales to Taiwan \"pretty soon.\"\n\n2. **Context of Decision:** American arms supplies to Taiwan have become a focal point ahead of Trump's anticipated visit to China in the coming weeks.\n\n3. **Xi Jinping Warning:** Xi Jinping issued a warning to the U.S. president in a recent phone call (specific details of the warning not provided in the extracted content).\n\n4. **Timing:** Trump made these comments to reporters aboard Air Force One en route to Maryland on February 16, 2026.\n\n## Related Context (from article headlines):\n- The article references related stories about Taiwan defense spending, U.S.-Taiwan relations, and China-Taiwan tensions\n- Topics include Taiwan's defense budget ($40 billion mentioned in one headline), legislative approval of defense spending, and broader geopolitical tensions\n\n**Note:** The extracted content appears incomplete, as the main article text cuts off after the introductory paragraphs and transitions into navigation elements and related article headlines. The core information available focuses on Trump's statement about imminent decisions on Taiwan arms sales and the context of his upcoming China visit.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://news.az/news/china-urges-cooperation-with-us-warns-over-taiwan-tensions\">\n# Summary of Article: \"China urges cooperation with US, warns over Taiwan tensions\"\n\n**Key Facts and Statements:**\n\n1. **Source and Context**: Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke at the Munich conference regarding US-China relations and Taiwan tensions.\n\n2. **Call for Cooperation**: Wang Yi stated that China and the United States should work together to maintain global stability, describing such cooperation as \"the most positive outcome in the current global environment.\"\n\n3. **Taiwan Warning**: Wang Yi warned that attempts to separate Taiwan from China could push the two powers closer to conflict. He emphasized that Taiwan remains \"one of the most sensitive issues in China-US relations\" and that moves toward formal separation could \"significantly raise geopolitical tensions.\"\n\n4. **Perception of US Attitude**: Wang Yi mentioned that China is encouraged by what he described as \"signs of growing respect for Beijing within Washington.\"\n\n5. **Europe-China Relations**: Wang Yi stated that Beijing does not want relations between Europe and China to be framed as systemic rivalry, instead calling for \"balanced and pragmatic cooperation.\"\n\n**Note on Source Reliability**: The article cites Al Jazeera as the original source for this reporting. The statements are attributed to a named official (Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi) speaking at a known international forum (Munich conference), which adds credibility to the reporting.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.dailysabah.com/world/china-warns-us-of-confrontation-over-any-plotting-on-taiwan/news\">\n# Summary of Article: \"China warns US of 'confrontation' over any 'plotting' on Taiwan\"\n\n**Source:** Daily Sabah (via Agence France-Presse - AFP)  \n**Date:** February 14, 2026\n\n## Key Facts and Statements:\n\n1. **Event and Speaker:** China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi spoke at the Munich Security Conference in Germany on Saturday (February 14, 2026).\n\n2. **Main Warning:** Wang Yi warned that U.S. efforts to use Taiwan to undermine Beijing's claims could cross a \"red line\" and risk direct confrontation between China and the United States.\n\n3. **Specific Quote on Red Line:** Wang stated that if the U.S. adopts a China policy involving \"instigating and plotting to split China through Taiwan, crossing China's red line,\" this \"could very likely lead to a confrontation between China and the United States.\"\n\n4. **China's Preparedness:** Wang expressed hope that Washington would pursue a \"positive and pragmatic\" approach but added \"we are also prepared to deal with various risks.\"\n\n5. **Background Context Provided:**\n   - China claims self-ruled Taiwan as its own territory\n   - China has not ruled out the use of force to bring Taiwan under its control\n   - The U.S. is Taiwan's most important backer and biggest arms provider\n   - Taiwan would be heavily reliant on U.S. support in a potential conflict with China\n\n6. **Additional Comments:** Wang also criticized Japan regarding Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi (who took office in October), warning against \"far-right forces\" and those seeking to \"revive militarism.\"\n\n**Note:** This article represents official statements from a named Chinese government official (Foreign Minister Wang Yi) at a major international security conference.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Retrieve the historical daily community prediction values for Metaculus question 41139 \"Will China attack or blockade Taiwan during 2026?\" and summarize notable jumps since January 2025.\nObjective.  The original query asks for (a) the historical daily Community Prediction (CP) series for Metaculus question #41139 \u201cWill China attack or blockade Taiwan during 2026?\u201d and (b) a narrative of the major probability jumps occurring since 1 Jan 2025.\n\nWhat the search results give us.  \n1.  None of the nine search snippets returned any table, graph, csv, or even a single numerical data-point for the CP trajectory of question #41139.  \n2.  Several items (e.g., the Metaculus \u201cbot-template\u201d repository and \u201cforecasting-tools\u201d package) confirm that an authenticated Metaculus REST-API endpoint exists that exposes a question\u2019s timeline\u2014including the daily community prediction\u2014but the results do not reproduce any call or output from that endpoint (GitHub, \u201cmetac-bot-template\u201d; GitHub, \u201cforecasting-tools\u201d).  \n3.  One forum post and one Manifold market simply paraphrase the resolution criteria and current headline percentage but again offer no historical series (EA Forum; Manifold market).  \n\nConsequences for the query.  \n\u2022  Because no historical data points are present in the retrieved material, it is impossible to compile the requested daily CP history or to identify and quantify \u201cnotable jumps\u201d after 1 Jan 2025.  \n\u2022  The only quantitative figure that can be cited with confidence from the search results is the current CP of 12 % on 16 Feb 2026, already supplied in the question prompt.  \n\nRemaining information gap.  \nA complete answer requires the raw timeline data that Metaculus exposes through its API at an endpoint of the form:  \nhttps://www.metaculus.com/api2/questions/41139/timeline/  \nor, equivalently, via the wrapper functions contained in metaculus-python, forecasting-tools, or metac-bot-template.  The response payload returns a list of timestamped entries (each containing the community prediction, Metaculus prediction, number of forecasts, etc.).  Without that payload the historical series cannot be reconstructed.\n\nConclusion.  \nThe search results confirm that the information is publicly accessible but do not actually contain it.  Therefore:\n\n1. Additional data are still required: the JSON timeline export (or any secondary source that has already downloaded it).  \n2. Once that dataset is in hand, the analysis could proceed by:  \n   \u2022  Resampling the raw timestamps to daily frequency (taking the last CP for each date).  \n   \u2022  Computing day-on-day deltas to flag \u201cnotable jumps\u201d (e.g., |\u0394CP| \u2265 1 percentage point) since 2025-01-01.  \n   \u2022  Summarising each jump with the date, magnitude, and (optionally) a short news context.\n\nBecause the essential dataset is missing, an evidence-based chronology of jumps cannot yet be produced.</Agent_report>\n"
