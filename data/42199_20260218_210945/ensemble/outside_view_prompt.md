You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the community prediction be higher than 52.00% on 2026-02-27 for the Metaculus question "Will an AI-created song chart in the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 before 2027?"?

Question background:
Metaculus is a crowdsourced forecast aggregation platform where humans and bots compete to predict future events. Each question on Metaculus has a community prediction that aggregates all user's forecasts. As of this question launch, this aggregation is calculated as a median of user forecasts weighted by recency. 

--------------------------------

Below are some details about the original Metaculus question: 
- Question URL: https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40969
- Original question title: Will an AI-created song chart in the top 20 of the Billboard Hot 100 before 2027?
- The current community prediction as of 2026-02-16: 52.00%

Original resolution criteria: 
> This question will resolve as **Yes** if a song largely created by AI lists in the top 20 on any weekly [Billboard Hot 100](https://www.billboard.com/charts/hot-100/) chart released before January 1, 2027.

Original fine print: 
> * According to the current schedule, the chart for the week of January 2, 2027 will be released on December 29, 2026 and therefore is included in this question. If the release schedule changes, the final week whose results are fully encompassed within 2026 will be the final one included.&#x20;
> * This question will use credible sources or artist credits to determine whether a song is largely created by AI.
> * For the purpose of this question, a song will be considered as largely created by AI if either of the following is true:
>   * The vocal melody is composed and performed by an AI. This does not include voice conversion, in which an AI changes the style/voice of an existing recording.
>   * The lead melodic instrument as well as the majority of the instruments are composed and generated by an AI. Minor edits or AI-generated accompaniment alone will not qualify.
> * Whether a song's lyrics are written by a human or AI will have no impact on this question.
> * If Metaculus assesses that AI songs have been explicitly prohibited from appearing in the Hot 100 list in a manner that would significantly impact the resolution of this question, this question will be **annulled**.

Original background: 
> During 2025, AI created songs have began to place on various [Billboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billboard_\(magazine\)) charts, with at least six songs landing in the charts within the year. As of late 2025, this trend is accelerating leading to speculation an AI created song may soon chart on the Billboard Hot 100.
> 
> [How Many AI Artists Have Debuted on Billboard’s Charts?:](https://www.billboard.com/lists/ai-artists-on-billboard-charts/childpets-galore/)
> 
> > Notably, at least one AI artist has debuted in each of the past five chart weeks, a streak suggesting this trend is quickly accelerating.

This question's outcome will be determined by the specific criteria below. These criteria have not yet been satisfied:
This question will resolve based on the community prediction of the Metaculus question found [here](https://www.metaculus.com/questions/40969) (i.e. the 'target question'). If the community prediction of the target question on 2026-02-27 01:50:54 is higher than 52.00%, this question will resolve to 'Yes'. If it is lower or equal to 52.00%, this question will resolve to 'No'. If the target question has already resolved before this question opens, then this question will be annulled. If the target question resolves after this question opens, but before 2026-02-27 01:50:54, then this question will resolve to the same value as the target question.

# Summary of Article: "Billboard just blocked the first-ever AI song from the Hot 100"

**Source:** Djrobblog.com  
**Date:** November 20, 2025

## Key Facts and Statistics:

- **The Song in Question:** "I Run" by virtual act HAVEN, produced by UK's Harrison Walker
- **Expected Chart Performance:** According to a reliable data account with ~99% accuracy rate, the song amassed enough sales, streams, and radio points to debut in the low 60s on the Hot 100
- **Actual Chart Performance:** The song did not appear on the Hot 100 chart released November 18, 2025
- **Streaming Status:** Spotify, Apple Music, and other streamers have removed the track, though it remains available on iTunes
- **AI Acts on Other Billboard Charts:** At least six AI acts have charted in "the past few months" according to Billboard's acknowledgment to ABC News

## Notable Examples of AI Songs on Billboard Charts:

1. **Xania Monet** (created by Mississippi poet Telisha Nikki Jones using Suno) - first AI act to debut on a Billboard chart with real radio airplay
2. **Breaking Rust** - hit No. 1 on Country Digital Song Sales chart with "Walk My Walk"
3. AI-created acts have appeared on Hot R&B Songs, Country Digital Song Sales, and Hot Gospel Songs charts

## Opinions and Context:

- **Producer's Claim:** Harrison Walker claims the vocals are his own, heavily manipulated to sound like a female voice (attributed to "Kaitlin Aragon")
- **Billboard's Stance (inferred):** The article suggests Billboard's actions "appear to reflect a philosophical stance: The Hot 100 is meant to track the consumption of real human artists"
- **Study Citation:** A recent study showed 97% of listeners cannot distinguish AI-generated tracks from traditionally created digital music
- **Historical Parallel:** The article references the 2019 removal of "Old Town Road" from Hot Country Songs, which led to public backlash and the song becoming the longest-running No. 1 in Hot 100 history

## Update:

Billboard issued a statement on November 20 indicating the song was withheld from charts due to a "[legal] dispute," though the nature of this dispute is unclear.

**Note:** This article is from a blog source (Djrobblog.com) rather than an official news outlet, though it cites Billboard's actions and statements.

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide timeline of AI-created songs charting on Billboard Hot 100, including peak positions, weeks on chart, and any Billboard policy statements on AI music up to 2026-02-18
Overview  
A thorough review of Billboard’s own reporting, NPR, CNN and other trade coverage up to 18 Feb 2026 shows that—despite a surge of AI-generated tracks on specialized Billboard charts in 2025—not a single song that meets the Metaculus definition of “largely created by AI” has appeared on the Billboard Hot 100. All confirmed AI tracks have so far been restricted to format-specific sales, streaming or airplay charts (e.g., Country Digital Song Sales, Hot Gospel Songs, Adult R&B Airplay) and to the Emerging Artists tally. The lone title that came closest, HAVEN.’s “I Run,” was ruled ineligible for the Hot 100 pending copyright-infringement claims and therefore never entered the chart.  

Consequently, the timeline of AI-created songs that have actually “charted on Billboard Hot 100” is empty through 18 Feb 2026. What does exist is a clear chronology of:  
• AI songs reaching other Billboard charts, and  
• Billboard policy statements that explain why none of them has yet migrated to the flagship Hot 100.  

1. Key policy statements by Billboard affecting AI music  

a) Copyright-dispute rule (explicitly invoked Nov 2025)  
   – “Billboard reserves the right to withhold or remove titles from appearing on the charts that are known to be involved in active legal disputes related to copyright infringement …” (Billboard, 20 Nov 2025). This clause was the basis for excluding HAVEN.’s “I Run” from that week’s Hot 100.  

b) Data-validation rule (ongoing)  
   – Billboard and its data partner Luminate “review and authenticate data… data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed” (Billboard, 20 Oct 2025). While not AI-specific, the rule underpins decisions on any track—AI or human—that uses non-transparent sourcing or questionable uploads.  

c) Use of third-party AI-detection tags  
   – In an investigative roundup, Billboard disclosed that it cross-checks suspected AI tracks with “Deezer’s AI detection tool, which adds a flag to all AI-generated content on the platform” (Billboard, 4 Nov 2025). This indicates a vetting process rather than an outright ban.  

d) No categorical prohibition  
   – Nowhere has Billboard stated that AI-generated music is automatically ineligible for the Hot 100. In practice, if a track is demonstrably legitimate and clears copyright hurdles, it can chart; none has yet cleared those hurdles.  

2. Near-miss: HAVEN. – “I Run” (Dance/EDM)  

• Viral build-up: Previewed 10 Oct 2025 on TikTok; reached #11 U.S. Spotify Daily; #25 Global Spotify (Billboard, 20 Nov 2025).  
• AI involvement: Producer duo admitted “AI-assisted vocal processing” via Suno to transform Harrison Walker’s voice into a female timbre (Billboard, 20 Nov 2025).  
• Legal challenge: The Orchard (distributor for Jorja Smith’s label FAMM) plus the RIAA & IFPI issued takedown notices alleging a deep-fake of Smith’s voice; streaming services removed the original upload.  
• Billboard action: Withheld from Hot 100 while dispute is active; thus it logged 0 weeks, 0 peak on Hot 100 (Billboard, 20 Nov 2025).  

3. AI songs that have charted on other Billboard rankings (context for momentum)  

Although outside the scope of the Hot 100 timeline, these records illustrate the accelerating presence of AI on Billboard and therefore inform forecasting:  

• Breaking Rust – “Walk My Walk”  
   – #1 Country Digital Song Sales (week of 08 Nov 2025) (NPR, 10 Nov 2025; NME, 16 Nov 2025).  
   – #14 Country Digital Song Sales on debut; later #5 Digital Song Sales all-genre (Billboard, 4 Nov 2025).  
   – Project also reached #9 Emerging Artists.  
   – AI origin: Suno-generated vocals & instrumentation.  

• Xania Monet – “Let Go, Let God” / “How Was I Supposed to Know?”  
   – AI gospel/R&B persona created with Suno.  
   – “Let Go, Let God” peak #3 Hot Gospel Songs (25 Oct 2025);  
   – “How Was I Supposed to Know?” peak #20 Hot R&B Songs and #1 R&B Digital Song Sales (Billboard, 4 Nov 2025).  
   – First AI act to debut on a Billboard airplay chart: #30 Adult R&B Airplay (11 Nov 2025) (CNN, 1 Nov 2025).  

• Additional AI or AI-assisted entrants (Aug–Nov 2025): Child Pets Galore, Unbound Music, Enlly Blue, Juno Skye, Cain Walker, World Hive, Solomon Ray, Josh M—all logged positions on genre-focused digital-sales charts and/or Emerging Artists but none on the Hot 100 (Billboard, 4 Nov 2025).  

4. Why hasn’t an AI song reached the Hot 100 yet?  

• Sales thresholds on niche charts are low (1,000–4,000 downloads) and do not translate automatically into the multi-metric Hot 100, which averages 15–25 million weekly streams plus robust airplay for a top-40 entry.  
• Radio remains cautious; only Xania Monet has breached monitored airplay (#30 Adult R&B Airplay), limiting Hot 100 points.  
• Industry litigation (e.g., majors vs. Suno and Udio, $500 million suits filed 2024 and partially settled 2025) keeps many AI uploads in legal gray zones, triggering Billboard’s “withhold” option.  
• Billboard’s verification regime (data scrubbing + copyright vetting) removes manipulated bulk downloads or suspect uploads that some AI promoters rely on.  

5. Implications for the Metaculus forecast (reference point 18 Feb 2026)  

• Factual status: Zero qualifying AI songs have charted on the Hot 100; the closest attempt was blocked.  
• Institutional stance: Billboard has not banned AI songs, but its active policing of disputed content and reliance on traditional consumption metrics raise the bar compared with digital-sales lists.  
• Trend line: Momentum is unmistakable—at least one AI act has debuted on some Billboard ranking every chart week for six straight weeks (Billboard, 4 Nov 2025). Xania Monet’s signing to a multimillion-dollar deal shows label muscle forming behind AI acts, which could enable the radio push and marketing spend needed for Hot 100 breakthrough in 2026-2027.  

6. Summary timeline relevant to the Hot 100 (through 18 Feb 2026)  

Date | AI track | Intended or rumored Hot 100 appearance | Outcome  
-----|----------|----------------------------------------|---------  
Oct 2025 → Nov 2025 | HAVEN. – “I Run” | Hot 100 debut forecast by chart watchers for mid-Nov 2025 | Billboard withheld entry due to active copyright claims; 0 weeks, no peak (Billboard, 20 Nov 2025).  
(There are no other AI-generated tracks with verified Hot 100 activity up to 18 Feb 2026.)  

7. Billboard policy milestones affecting AI music  

• Sep 2023: First known AI “voice-filter” novelty (“Trump The Don” – “First Day Out”) charts on Rap Digital Song Sales, foreshadowing policy scrutiny (Billboard, 4 Nov 2025).  
• Jun 2024–present: Billboard employs AI-detection tags from partners such as Deezer for content vetting (Billboard, 4 Nov 2025).  
• 20 Oct 2025: Recurrent-rule overhaul to reduce chart congestion; while not AI-specific, the change signals ongoing maintenance of chart integrity (Billboard, 20 Oct 2025).  
• 20 Nov 2025: Copyright-dispute clause publicly cited to keep “I Run” off Hot 100 (Billboard, 20 Nov 2025).  

Conclusion  
Up to 18 Feb 2026, the Billboard Hot 100 has yet to host an AI-created song. The absence is not from an explicit ban but from (1) Billboard’s standard data-validation and copyright-clearance rules, which have already sidelined one AI track, and (2) the still-limited commercial footprint—especially in U.S. radio airplay—of AI acts. Nevertheless, AI music’s rapid encroachment on secondary Billboard charts, combined with label investment and improving detection transparency, suggests that the qualifying breakthrough could plausibly occur before the 2027 deadline that the Metaculus community is forecasting on.</Agent_report>
