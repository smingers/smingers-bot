Analysis:
To estimate whether the Metaculus community will move above 52 % in the coming nine days, I need the freshest evidence about (a) any AI-generated song already landing in, or very near, the Hot 100 top-20, (b) Billboard’s stance or rule changes regarding AI music, (c) major industry announcements (e.g., new commercial AI-music tools, record-label deals) that could make such a charting event likelier before 2027, and (d) any setbacks such as legal bans or platform removals that would push probability down. Relevant coverage is most likely in technology-music crossover outlets and the entertainment business press during late-2025 through Feb-2026.
