Analysis:
To judge whether the Metaculus community prediction will drift above 52 % during the next nine days, the most pertinent historical context is:  
• How often AI-created songs have already appeared on any Billboard chart, especially the Hot 100 and, even more so, the top-20 region.  
• Whether any near-misses (e.g., #21–30) or rapid upward trajectories are currently on the Hot 100, which would raise probability estimates.  
• Billboard’s evolving acceptance or rejection of AI music, since policy shifts could suddenly block or enable charting.  
• Recent comment threads or edits on the Metaculus question itself, as large user updates often follow news about chart performance or industry policy.  
Consequently, searches should gather (a) historical chart entries by AI acts, (b) very recent news about AI songs climbing the Hot 100, and (c) summaries of AI-song chart history and Billboard policy that a reasoning agent can compile.
