Three AI-related stocks are predicted to experience significant momentum in 2026: Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA), Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE: TSM), and Applied Materials (NASDAQ: AMAT). Nvidia is expected to maintain its dominance in the AI chip market, with roughly 90% market share, and expand into full-stack AI solutions, including its Rubin system, which is entering full production and set to launch in the second half of 2026. The company has over $500 billion in revenue commitments from 2025 to 2026 and is diversifying its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) supply chain across Samsung, SK Hynix, and Micron Technology, reducing supply risks. Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (TSMC) is expected to see revenue growth close to 30% in 2026, with AI chip revenue projected to grow at a mid-to-high-50% annual rate through 2029. TSMC is ramping up 2-nanometer (N2) and N2P node production in 2025\u20132026 and expects advanced packaging to contribute over 10% of revenue in 2026. Applied Materials, the largest U.S. semiconductor equipment provider, is forecast to see its semiconductor equipment business grow by over 20% in 2026, supported by surging demand for advanced logic chips, HBM, and complex packaging. Industry data from SEMI projects semiconductor equipment sales to reach $126 billion in 2026 and $135 billion in 2027, with Applied Materials benefiting from increased production complexity and higher tool demand per chip. The report concludes that these three companies are well-positioned to capitalize on the sustained AI-driven capital spending surge.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 06:45 PM\nSource:[The Motley Fool](https://www.fool.com/investing/2026/02/18/predict-ai-stocks-momentum-amat-tsm-nvda/)\n\n**ChatGPT and Gemini Predict Ermal Meta as Winner of Sanremo 2026 Based on Song Lyrics**\nAn experiment using two leading AI models\u2014ChatGPT (GPT-5.2, free version) and Gemini 3 Pro\u2014analyzed the lyrics of songs competing in the 2026 Sanremo Music Festival to predict the winner based on textual quality and message. Both models, despite differing in evaluation criteria, independently identified Ermal Meta with 'Stella stellina' as the likely winner, citing its emotional impact and narrative about an unnamed Palestinian girl whose life is shattered by war. ChatGPT ranked Levante's 'Sei tu' second (92/100) and Enrico Nigiotti's 'Ogni volta che non so volare' third (91/100), while Gemini placed Arisa's 'Magica Favola' and Serena Brancale's 'Qui con me' in second and third, respectively. ChatGPT favored introspective, poetic, and structurally coherent lyrics, while Gemini prioritized narrative immersion, originality, and communicative impact\u2014evident in higher rankings for Dargen D'Amico and Ditonellapiaga. Both models penalized clich\u00e9d or light-hearted songs, with 'Tu mi piaci tanto' by Sayf (86/100) and 'Stupida sfortuna' by Fulminacci (84/100) receiving mid-tier scores despite being favored by bookmakers. The analysis explicitly acknowledges that music quality cannot be reduced to text alone, as arrangement and performance remain unaccounted for. The final rankings reflect AI-generated predictions, not objective outcomes.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 12:39 PM\nSource:[Fanpage](https://www.fanpage.it/innovazione/tecnologia/chatgpt-e-gemini-svelano-il-podio-dei-cantanti-di-sanremo-2026-il-vincitore-dopo-lanalisi-delle-canzoni/)\n\n**Metaculus Launches FutureEval to Track AI Forecasting Accuracy**\nMetaculus, a forecasting platform and public benefit corporation, has launched FutureEval, a continuously updated benchmark that measures the accuracy of AI systems in predicting real-world events and compares their performance against elite human forecasters. Unlike static reasoning tests, FutureEval evaluates probabilistic forecasts across domains such as science, technology, health, geopolitics, and AI, using questions with unknown outcomes to prevent test-set contamination and ensure real-world relevance. The benchmark consists of three components: the Model Leaderboard, which tests major AI models using standardized prompts and tracks performance trends; Bot Tournaments, where developers compete for $175,000 in annual prizes; and Human Baselines derived from predictions by the Metaculus community and Pro Forecasters. As of February 2026, humans still outperform AI, but projections indicate AI systems could surpass the broader Metaculus community by April 2026 and Pro Forecasters by mid-2027. According to Metaculus CEO Deger Turan, 'AI models are not better than the pros yet, but they're progressing fast enough that we need to prepare for a world where they are.' AI Research Engineer Ben Wilson emphasized that 'if AI can forecast as well as humans, that is a big deal, impacting decision-making across business, finance, marketing, law, and more,' but stressed the need to determine when AI forecasts can be trusted. FutureEval offers advantages over existing benchmarks by measuring decision-relevant forecasting ability, resisting training contamination, avoiding saturation through increasing question difficulty, and using probabilistic scoring to assess accuracy, calibration, and discrimination. It also identifies where AI and human forecasts diverge, helping organizations understand when and how AI forecasting capabilities can be reliably integrated.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 02:22 AM\nSource:[GlobeNewswire Press Releases](https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2026/02/18/3239902/0/en/Metaculus-Launches-FutureEval-to-Track-AI-Forecasting-Accuracy.html)\n\n**Monday AI Radar #13 -- LessWrong**\nThe February 18, 2026 issue of 'Monday AI Radar #13' from LessWrong highlights rapid advancements in AI, emphasizing 'velocity' in model development. Major model releases\u2014including Claude Opus 4.6, GPT-5.3-Codex, and GPT-5.3-Codex-Spark\u2014show significant improvements, with Opus 4.6 identifying over 500 high-severity zero-day vulnerabilities, demonstrating AI's growing cyber capabilities. Anthropic's system cards, while better than others, are deemed insufficient for evaluating frontier models, raising concerns about safety and alignment. OpenAI's introduction of Lockdown Mode in ChatGPT reflects a growing tension between capability and security. The article notes that AI is now making highly accurate predictions\u2014ranking eighth out of over 500 participants in a Metaculus tournament\u2014and that AI's impact on jobs is intensifying workloads rather than reducing them. Concerns about alignment persist, with discussions on aligning AI to integrity and virtues. China\u2019s AI progress is analyzed, with contrasting strategies between U.S. and Chinese firms, and debates over whether Chinese models are falling behind. Technical breakthroughs include Karpathy\u2019s 200-line GPT engine and a paper showing that 80\u201390% of performance gains at the frontier come from training compute, not algorithms. The piece also explores AI psychology, rationality, and the need for third-party safety audits. OpenAI is under scrutiny for potentially violating California\u2019s SB 53 AI safety law by releasing high-capability models without activating required safeguards. The overarching theme is that AI capabilities are advancing faster than our ability to evaluate or regulate them.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 12:13 AM\nSource:[Maya Farber Brodsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/nq4yQTfZEg8tJsXJE/monday-ai-radar-13)\n\n**'Send Your Child to Medical School?' The Rise of AI Phobia in the Medical Community Amid 'Doctor Extinction' Fears**\nThe rapid integration of artificial intelligence (AI) into medical practice has triggered widespread anxiety across the medical community, fueling fears of a 'doctors' extinction' narrative. A professor from one of South Korea's top five hospitals\u2014Seoul National, Asan, Severance, Samsung Seoul, and Seoul National University Hospital\u2014stated on February 18 that AI is already handling routine tasks such as interpreting X-rays and CT scans, significantly threatening job security for physicians in internal medicine, radiology, and pathology. A practicing internal medicine specialist noted that doctors now increasingly consult AI instead of colleagues, and cited data from OpenAI showing over 40 million daily health-related queries on ChatGPT. The specialist claimed that the diagnostic and prescription capabilities of general internal medicine physicians are already inferior to AI, predicting that AI will soon erode physician authority. In January 2026, Utah, USA, launched a pilot program allowing AI to autonomously renew prescriptions without physician intervention\u2014the first such instance in the U.S. The Washington Post reported that over 75% of FDA-approved medical AI software is designed to support radiology and clinical care, warning that radiologists may soon lose their jobs. However, some medical specialties are considered less vulnerable to AI replacement, including internal medicine, emergency medicine, surgery, cardiology, neurosurgery, anesthesiology, orthopedics, rehabilitation medicine, dermatology, and plastic surgery, due to the need for real-time human interaction, tactile assessment, and complex decision-making under life-or-death pressure. Elon Musk recently predicted that robots surpassing surgeons will emerge within the next three years.

Consumer behavior received a 'C' grade: despite low confidence, spending on travel, dining, and entertainment remained strong, with a growing shift toward AI-powered shopping assistants like ChatGPT and Gemini replacing traditional search methods. Automation expectations earned a 'B-' grade: progress was made in targeted areas such as new distribution and manufacturing facilities, particularly with semi-automated systems that support human judgment, but full-scale automation did not materialize due to workforce readiness, data gaps, and organizational complexity. AI adoption advanced in specific domains\u2014especially code generation and platform-integrated tools like Claude and Gemini\u2014but 'agentic AI' underperformed, with engineers spending more time fixing AI-generated errors. AI hype outpaced reality, and experts now emphasize accuracy, guardrails, and regulation over model capability as key constraints for 2026. The economic outlook received a 'C+' grade due to extreme volatility from rapid policy shifts, including tariff announcements that caused GDP to contract initially before rebounding on export growth. Forecasters failed to anticipate the scale of trade policy changes. Looking ahead, experts stress that 2026 will reward operational readiness over technological promises, discipline over hype, and actual behavior over stated intentions. As Chris Gaffney notes, '2026 will reward operators who treat automation as a system to be run, not a solution to be bought.'\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 11:00 AM\nSource:[Newswise - SciNews](https://www.newswise.com/articles/grading-2025-s-biggest-predictions-and-what-they-signal-for-2026/)\n\n**Sina AI Hot Topics Hourly Report | February 17, 2026: Humanoid Robots Dominate 2026 Spring Festival Gala, AI Tech Surges in Consumer Markets**\nOn February 17, 2026, the 'Sina AI Hot Topics Hourly Report' highlighted major developments in artificial intelligence and robotics. The 2026 CCTV Spring Festival Gala featured an unprecedented concentration of humanoid robots, with four companies\u2014Songyan Dynamics, Unitree Robotics, Magic Atom, and Galaxy General\u2014performing on stage in acts including martial arts, parkour, dance, and interactive performances. This marked a significant milestone in the commercialization of embodied AI, with the event driving a surge in consumer interest: within two hours of the broadcast, JD.com reported a 300% increase in robot search volume, a 460% rise in customer service inquiries, and a 150% increase in orders, spanning over 100 cities across China. Unitree Robotics founder Wang Xingxing predicted the company would ship 10,000 to 20,000 humanoid robots, citing technological maturity as the key driver of market growth. The gala also showcased AI advancements, including ByteDance\u2019s video generation model Seedance 2.0, used in the visually stunning 'Celebrating the Flower Goddess' segment. Meanwhile, India hosted its largest-ever AI Impact Summit in New Delhi, with global tech leaders like Sundar Pichai and Sam Altman attending, though analysts note India still has a long way to go in AI development. On the hardware front, rising AI demand has driven memory price increases due to high bandwidth and capacity needs in AI training and inference. Additionally, AI-generated 'New Year greeting' videos have sparked legal concerns over potential violations of celebrity image and copyright rights. The report also noted that AI-generated misinformation about the 2026 Spring Festival travel rush was debunked by China Railway, with most content found to be historical footage or AI-fabricated. In parallel, AI glasses emerged as a top-selling tech item during the Lunar New Year, with sales rising 70%\u201380% in Shenzhen\u2019s Huaqiangbei district, and a broader trend of AI products becoming 'new year gifts' was observed.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 07:13 AM\nSource:[k.sina.com.cn](https://k.sina.com.cn/article_7857201856_1d45362c001902g9y4.html)\n\n**Life in 2050 Prediction: AI, Robots, Smart Cities, and New Jobs Redefine the Future**\nBy 2050, artificial intelligence (AI) is expected to deeply integrate into every aspect of life, influencing decisions in cities, healthcare, and transportation. Coastal cities face a rising risk of submersion due to climate change, prompting scientists to develop 'floating cities' powered by solar energy and desalination technology, with AI managing waste and resource distribution to nearly eliminate pollution. Transportation may shift to the skies, with autonomous vehicles, magnetic levitation (Maglev) trains, and air taxis becoming common, while AI-driven traffic control systems could eradicate traffic jams. Education will transition to personalized, virtual learning, allowing students to attend classes globally from home. While AI and robotics may eliminate traditional jobs, they are projected to create millions of new tech-driven career opportunities. In healthcare, nanorobots and advanced sensors could detect and treat diseases internally, potentially leading to a significant increase in average human lifespan.\nOriginal language: hi\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 04:21 AM\nSource:[punjabkesari](https://m.punjabkesari.in/national/news/what-will-the-world-be-like-in-2050-2293969)\n\n**What to Do If You Take AGI Seriously -- LessWrong**\nThis article, written for a general audience by Maya Farber Brodsky and published on February 17, 2026, addresses the growing concern around Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) and provides a comprehensive, evidence-based guide for individuals and organizations on how to prepare. The author defines AGI as AI systems capable of performing the majority of economically valuable cognitive work at or above human levels, distinguishing it from related milestones such as narrow AI (rung 1), agentic autonomy (rung 2), and AI-driven scientific discovery (rung 3). The essay synthesizes insights from five independent forecasting sources: AI researchers (Grace et al., 2024), superforecasters, mechanistic modelers, prediction markets (e.g., Metaculus, Manifold), and frontier lab leaders. While forecasts vary widely, a convergent downward revision in timelines has occurred: the 2024 survey of AI researchers found a 50% chance of AGI by 2047 (13 years earlier than in 2022), with a 10% chance by 2027. Prediction markets cluster around ~2031 for 'AGI-like' events, while some lab leaders suggest systems near human capability could emerge in 'a few years.' The author emphasizes that the gap between public forecasts (early 2030s) and insider claims (late 2020s) often reflects differing definitions\u2014public forecasts tend to focus on broad economic substitution (rung 4), while insiders often speak of early capabilities (rungs 1\u20132). Key obstacles to AGI include generalization beyond training data, persistent memory, causal/world modeling, long-horizon planning, and self-monitoring. A critical insight is the 'cheap-reward/expensive-reward' divide: AI advances fastest in domains with easily verifiable outcomes (e.g., code, math), but lags in areas requiring judgment, ambiguity, or delayed feedback (e.g., strategy, law). The emergence of inference-time compute (e.g., chain-of-thought reasoning) and data constraints (with diminishing returns from internet-scale text) further complicate forecasting. The 'Atoms Problem' highlights physical infrastructure limits: frontier training runs require multi-gigawatt power, and geopolitical competition (e.g., US-China chip export controls) shapes access. Despite rapid capability gains, economic integration lags\u2014early-career workers in AI-exposed roles show weaker outcomes, but macro-level disruption remains muted. Productivity gains are real but uneven: AI boosts less experienced workers on well-scoped tasks, but can slow experts on complex work due to increased review burdens. The 'calibration gap'\u2014where users believe AI helps them even when it does not\u2014has been documented in multiple studies. The distribution of AI\u2019s benefits is not automatic: ownership of models, data, and infrastructure concentrates power. Despite falling inference costs (a thousandfold drop in three years), access remains unequal: high-income countries account for 87% of notable AI models and 91% of venture funding. Global implications are significant: cognitive-labor arbitrage in developing nations may shrink, while AI could democratize access to expertise in underserved regions\u2014yet value capture remains concentrated in model-owning countries. The author concludes with practical advice: individuals should use AI intensively (10+ hours/week) to build judgment, protect high-tacit-knowledge tasks, anchor identity in problems not methods, and prioritize physical and interpersonal work. Organizations must redesign workflows around AI, not bolt it on, and measure real productivity. The core principle is robustness: prepare for fast change and slow diffusion simultaneously.

A significant number of respondents focused on the role of artificial intelligence (AI), with most expressing a positive outlook: one executive stated, 'I think 2026 is when we move past the anxiety and into genuine collaboration.' Others anticipated 'more AI confusion and pain' in the short term. Additional predictions included the continued global rise of local and regional music sounds, the growing importance of the catalog business, and a bold lone prediction that Rihanna will release a new album in 2026. The responses were compiled as part of a series offering insight into the perspectives of top industry leaders as the music business enters the new year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 04, 2026 06:30 PM\nSource:[Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/lists/billboard-power-100-honorees-music-industry-trends-2026/)\n\n**Joseph Prihodkin Says AI and Robots Will Replace Performers on Stage, But Only Temporarily**\nMusic producer Joseph Prihodkin stated in an interview with Public News Service that artificial intelligence (AI) may soon replace many pop artists if there are not enough truly strong vocalists among live performers. He emphasized that while globalization and new technologies are already creating serious competition for musicians, AI is ultimately a human creation and lacks soul. According to Prihodkin, AI can replicate songs better than original performers, but it cannot fully replace artists due to the absence of charisma, human qualities, and emotional depth. He predicted a temporary surge in popularity for AI singers, including those mimicking deceased artists, but noted that public interest would fade quickly. In November 2025, an AI singer named Zhania Mone became the first AI artist to appear on the Billboard radio chart, earning enough airplay to qualify. Her debut single was released in summer 2025, followed by a full 24-track album in August 2025. Mone signed a multimillion-dollar contract with a major American record label. The AI singer was created by poet Telysha Nikki Jones from Mississippi, who writes lyrics, while a specialized program generates the final music. Mone has over 146,000 followers on social media and is described as a modern R&B vocalist with an expressive style reminiscent of Keke Palmer. Hollywood has expressed concern over AI artists and actors taking jobs from human performers, but AI development in entertainment continues to advance.\nOriginal language: ru\nPublish date: January 13, 2026 03:31 PM\nSource:[\u0420\u0430\u043c\u0431\u043b\u0435\u0440](https://news.rambler.ru/starlife/55893254-iosif-prigozhin-rasskazal-kogda-roboty-i-ii-zamenyat-artistov-na-stsene/)\n\n**10 Music Industry Predictions for 2026: AI, Live Nation, K-Pop & More**\nA Billboard article published on January 8, 2026, presents 10 predictions for the music industry in 2026. It forecasts that AI will remain a topic of discussion but will not yet fully transform music creation, despite its potential as a creative tool. The Live Nation antitrust case is expected to intensify, with no settlement likely and more lawsuits anticipated due to high ticket prices. Universal Music Group\u2019s acquisition of Downtown will likely be approved by European regulators, possibly with divestitures, potentially triggering further corporate consolidations. Distributors and labels will increasingly blur their roles, offering artists more negotiation options but also potentially entrenching them in complex deals. Hip-hop will continue to decline in chart presence\u2014no hip-hop singles appeared in the top 40 of the Hot 100 on October 25, 2025, the first time since 1990\u2014but will remain dominant in catalog streaming and influence across genres. International music, including Latin and local-language hip-hop, will gain market share globally, reflecting demographic and competitive shifts. At least one major artist in 2026 will face empty seats due to overpricing or miscalculated demand, signaling a potential peak in ticket prices. The physical music market will remain K-shaped, with high-end audiophile vinyl products exceeding $100 and mass-market formats declining, reinforcing the merchandise model. Synchs (music in film/TV) will continue to drive streaming gains, exemplified by David Bowie\u2019s 'Heroes' surging after its use in the final episode of Stranger Things. Finally, artists\u2019 political statements\u2014such as Nicki Minaj\u2019s appearance at a Turning Point USA event\u2014will generate backlash, but with minimal real consequences, as fan loyalty often outweighs controversy, evidenced by a petition with under 50,000 signatures compared to her sold-out New York shows.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 08, 2026 06:10 PM\nSource:[Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/pro/music-industry-predictions-2026-ai-live-nation-k-pop-more/)\n\n**As AI Artists Breaking Rush & Cain Walker Rule a Country Chart, Nashville Execs Weigh in: 'It's Incredibly Detrimental'**\nAs artificial intelligence increasingly infiltrates the music industry, concerns are mounting within the country music community about authenticity and fan trust. According to Billboard's Country Digital Song Sales chart dated November 15, 2025, one-third of the top 10 songs were AI-assisted: 'Walk My Walk' by Breaking Rust (No. 1, selling over 2,000 copies), 'Don't Tread on Me' by Cain Walker (No. 3, over 1,000 copies), and 'Ain't My Problem' (No. 9, slightly under 1,000 copies). These tracks feature bold, defiant lyrics and boisterous vocals, with 'Walk My Walk' having a gospel-stomping feel. While sales remain modest compared to top-selling tracks like Taylor Swift\u2019s 'The Fate of Ophelia' (29,000 copies), AI has already entered radio airplay\u2014Xania Monet became the first known AI artist to chart on the Adult R&B Airplay chart at No. 30. Other AI-assisted acts have also debuted on various Billboard charts. However, terrestrial country radio stations have not added AI songs to their rotations. Country radio consultant Joel Raab notes listeners react negatively to AI voices, and stations prioritize real artists tied to touring and endorsements. Fletcher Foster of F2 Entertainment Group warns that AI songs clog charts and displace real artists who generate revenue through touring, publishing, and brand partnerships. FEMco founder Leslie Fram calls the rise of AI music a 'notable wake-up call' but not an existential threat\u2014yet\u2014emphasizing that while casual listeners may not care, dedicated fans value human imperfection and storytelling. Martina McBride supports the NO FAKES Act, which aims to protect artists\u2019 voices from unauthorized AI replication. Raab and Fram predict that, despite short-term AI popularity, human music with soul and authenticity will ultimately prevail, as true fan loyalty is built on real stories and evolution, not algorithms.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 13, 2025 01:29 AM\nSource:[Billboard](https://www.billboard.com/pro/ai-artists-breaking-rust-country-music-chart-reactions/)\n\n**Q2 AI Benchmark Results: Pros Maintain Clear Lead  --  LessWrong**\nIn the second quarter of 2025, the AI Benchmarking Series by LessWrong evaluated 54 bot-makers and 10 Pro Forecasters on 348 real-world forecasting questions from Metaculus, covering technology, politics, economics, environment, and society. The Pro team outperformed the bot team in head-to-head scoring, with an average score of -20.03 (95% CI: [-28.63, -11.41]) across 93 overlapping questions, indicating statistically significant superiority (p = 0.00001). The top bot was created by Panshul42, who used a multi-step agentic approach with multiple models (o3, o4-mini, sonnet 3.7/4) and research tools (Serper, BrightData.com), and open-sourced his code. The second-best bot, metac-o3, used AskNews for research and OpenAI's o3 model. Aggregation of multiple forecasts (median/mean) yielded the largest positive effect on performance (average +1,799 coverage-adjusted points), followed by custom question creation and resolution (+2,216 points). Manual review of bot outputs provided a smaller but still positive impact (+1,041 points). Use of AskNews did not show a statistically significant advantage. Time spent on development had a weak correlation (0.20) with score, while LLM calls per question had a moderate correlation (0.40). The best-performing bots were developed by students or hobbyists, with commercial entities ranking lower. Despite improvements in model quality, scaffolding (prompting, research, aggregation) provided only marginal gains over base model choice. The Pro team\u2019s consistent improvement, likely due to team coordination and better tooling, widened the performance gap. Over four quarters, pros consistently outperformed bots, though no clear trend in bot improvement was detected due to overlapping confidence intervals.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 28, 2025 05:40 AM\nSource:[Maya Farber Brodsky](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/Surnjh8A4WjgtQTkZ/q2-ai-benchmark-results-pros-maintain-clear-lead)\n\n**Start-up Mantic AI Challenges Human Forecasting with Collective Intelligence and Speed**\nMantic AI, a startup founded by former DeepMind AI scientist Toby Shevlane, has achieved significant progress in future prediction using artificial intelligence. In the first quarter of 2025, Mantic's AI ranked 8th in the MetaCulus Cup, a global forecasting competition that evaluates predictions on diverse topics such as political protests in France, Hamas releasing hostages, and U.S. financial aid to Argentina. The competition challenges participants to make accurate predictions based on limited background information, making it a test of judgment and insight. Mantic AI leverages 'collective intelligence'\u2014using dozens of small AI models whose aggregated predictions outperform individual models\u2014mirroring a proven method in MetaCulus, where collective intelligence consistently ranks in the top 4\u20135. The startup aims to automate future forecasting by combining high accuracy with AI\u2019s speed: while human forecasters take significant time and mental effort, Mantic\u2019s AI can update predictions in milliseconds. According to MetaCulus CEO Deguer Turan, AI could surpass human forecasters in this domain by 2029. Mantic\u2019s CEO Shevlane envisions 'industrializing prediction'\u2014transforming future forecasting into a scalable, real-time capability. The project builds on long-standing efforts by institutions like the U.S. RAND Corporation and the UK\u2019s INFER and Cosmic Bazaar projects, which train government officials in forecasting to improve policy decisions and risk monitoring. Mantic\u2019s technology has already demonstrated real-time forecasting, such as predicting the likelihood of a U.S.-Israel airstrike on Iran in June 2025, with probabilities rising sharply as events approached.\nOriginal language: ko\nPublish date: October 18, 2025 09:30 PM\nSource:[\uc544\uc2dc\uc544\uacbd\uc81c](https://www.asiae.co.kr/article/2025101410140522533)\n\n**How AI Outperforms Humans in Forecasting the Future**\nEvery three months, participants in the Metaculus Cup use artificial intelligence to predict geopolitical events in hopes of winning a prize of about $5,000. The platform poses questions such as 'Will Thailand experience a military coup before September\u202f2025?' and 'Will Israel strike the Iranian army again before September\u202f2025?' Experts estimate probabilities rather than simple yes/no answers. For example, Metaculus users correctly predicted the Russian invasion of Ukraine two weeks in advance and assigned a 90\u202f% probability to the U.S. v. Wade case roughly two months before it occurred. When the competition began in June, participants expected AI to outperform humans by 40\u202f% on average, but the Mantic AI system achieved over 80\u202f% accuracy. Prediction experts update their forecasts based on policy changes, allowing them to anticipate how virtual political interventions might affect future outcomes. Broad geopolitical forecasting remains extremely difficult, often requiring days and tens of thousands of dollars for a single question. The Rand Corporation estimates that human experts would need months to produce initial forecasts for all questions and to update them regularly. AI excels in data-rich, well-structured domains like weather or quantitative finance, but for geopolitics it must handle many interrelated factors. Large language models use the same complex information as human forecasters and can simulate human judgment, improving over time by predicting many questions, observing performance, and updating methods on a larger scale than humans can. Machines also have an unfair advantage in the competition: participants earn points not only for accuracy but also for coverage, the number of questions answered, and the frequency of updates. Even less accurate AI can rank highly by continuously updating estimates in response to emerging news\u2014a feat impossible for humans. This unfair advantage helps AI overcome the remaining challenge of producing high\u2011quality predictions for all questions.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: September 21, 2025 11:47 AM\nSource:[elnabaa.net](https://www.elnabaa.net/1136072/%D9%83%D9%8A%D9%81-%D9%8A%D8%AA%D9%81%D9%88%D9%82-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%B0%D9%83%D8%A7%D8%A1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A7%D8%B5%D8%B7%D9%86%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%8A-%D8%B9%D9%84%D9%89-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%B1-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AA%D9%86%D8%A8%D8%A4-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%82%D8%A8%D9%84)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
