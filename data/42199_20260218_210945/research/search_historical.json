All confirmed AI tracks have so far been restricted to format-specific sales, streaming or airplay charts (e.g., Country Digital Song Sales, Hot Gospel Songs, Adult R&B Airplay) and to the Emerging Artists tally. The lone title that came closest, HAVEN.\u2019s \u201cI Run,\u201d was ruled ineligible for the Hot 100 pending copyright-infringement claims and therefore never entered the chart.  \n\nConsequently, the timeline of AI-created songs that have actually \u201ccharted on Billboard Hot 100\u201d is empty through 18 Feb 2026. What does exist is a clear chronology of:  \n\u2022 AI songs reaching other Billboard charts, and  \n\u2022 Billboard policy statements that explain why none of them has yet migrated to the flagship Hot 100.  \n\n1. Key policy statements by Billboard affecting AI music  \n\na) Copyright-dispute rule (explicitly invoked Nov 2025)  \n   \u2013 \u201cBillboard reserves the right to withhold or remove titles from appearing on the charts that are known to be involved in active legal disputes related to copyright infringement \u2026\u201d (Billboard, 20 Nov 2025). This clause was the basis for excluding HAVEN.\u2019s \u201cI Run\u201d from that week\u2019s Hot 100.  \n\nb) Data-validation rule (ongoing)  \n   \u2013 Billboard and its data partner Luminate \u201creview and authenticate data\u2026 data deemed suspicious or unverifiable is removed\u201d (Billboard, 20 Oct 2025). While not AI-specific, the rule underpins decisions on any track\u2014AI or human\u2014that uses non-transparent sourcing or questionable uploads.  \n\nc) Use of third-party AI-detection tags  \n   \u2013 In an investigative roundup, Billboard disclosed that it cross-checks suspected AI tracks with \u201cDeezer\u2019s AI detection tool, which adds a flag to all AI-generated content on the platform\u201d (Billboard, 4 Nov 2025). This indicates a vetting process rather than an outright ban.  \n\nd) No categorical prohibition  \n   \u2013 Nowhere has Billboard stated that AI-generated music is automatically ineligible for the Hot 100. In practice, if a track is demonstrably legitimate and clears copyright hurdles, it can chart; none has yet cleared those hurdles.  \n\n2. Near-miss: HAVEN. \u2013 \u201cI Run\u201d (Dance/EDM)  \n\n\u2022 Viral build-up: Previewed 10 Oct 2025 on TikTok; reached #11 U.S. Spotify Daily; #25 Global Spotify (Billboard, 20 Nov 2025).  \n\u2022 AI involvement: Producer duo admitted \u201cAI-assisted vocal processing\u201d via Suno to transform Harrison Walker\u2019s voice into a female timbre (Billboard, 20 Nov 2025).  \n\u2022 Legal challenge: The Orchard (distributor for Jorja Smith\u2019s label FAMM) plus the RIAA & IFPI issued takedown notices alleging a deep-fake of Smith\u2019s voice; streaming services removed the original upload.  \n\u2022 Billboard action: Withheld from Hot 100 while dispute is active; thus it logged 0 weeks, 0 peak on Hot 100 (Billboard, 20 Nov 2025).  \n\n3. AI songs that have charted on other Billboard rankings (context for momentum)  \n\nAlthough outside the scope of the Hot 100 timeline, these records illustrate the accelerating presence of AI on Billboard and therefore inform forecasting:  \n\n\u2022 Breaking Rust \u2013 \u201cWalk My Walk\u201d  \n   \u2013 #1 Country Digital Song Sales (week of 08 Nov 2025) (NPR, 10 Nov 2025; NME, 16 Nov 2025).  \n   \u2013 #14 Country Digital Song Sales on debut; later #5 Digital Song Sales all-genre (Billboard, 4 Nov 2025).  \n   \u2013 Project also reached #9 Emerging Artists.  \n   \u2013 AI origin: Suno-generated vocals & instrumentation.  \n\n\u2022 Xania Monet \u2013 \u201cLet Go, Let God\u201d / \u201cHow Was I Supposed to Know?\u201d  \n   \u2013 AI gospel/R&B persona created with Suno.  \n   \u2013 \u201cLet Go, Let God\u201d peak #3 Hot Gospel Songs (25 Oct 2025);  \n   \u2013 \u201cHow Was I Supposed to Know?\u201d peak #20 Hot R&B Songs and #1 R&B Digital Song Sales (Billboard, 4 Nov 2025).  \n   \u2013 First AI act to debut on a Billboard airplay chart: #30 Adult R&B Airplay (11 Nov 2025) (CNN, 1 Nov 2025).  \n\n\u2022 Additional AI or AI-assisted entrants (Aug\u2013Nov 2025): Child Pets Galore, Unbound Music, Enlly Blue, Juno Skye, Cain Walker, World Hive, Solomon Ray, Josh M\u2014all logged positions on genre-focused digital-sales charts and/or Emerging Artists but none on the Hot 100 (Billboard, 4 Nov 2025).  \n\n4. Why hasn\u2019t an AI song reached the Hot 100 yet?  \n\n\u2022 Sales thresholds on niche charts are low (1,000\u20134,000 downloads) and do not translate automatically into the multi-metric Hot 100, which averages 15\u201325 million weekly streams plus robust airplay for a top-40 entry.  \n\u2022 Radio remains cautious; only Xania Monet has breached monitored airplay (#30 Adult R&B Airplay), limiting Hot 100 points.  \n\u2022 Industry litigation (e.g., majors vs. Suno and Udio, $500 million suits filed 2024 and partially settled 2025) keeps many AI uploads in legal gray zones, triggering Billboard\u2019s \u201cwithhold\u201d option.  \n\u2022 Billboard\u2019s verification regime (data scrubbing + copyright vetting) removes manipulated bulk downloads or suspect uploads that some AI promoters rely on.  \n\n5. Implications for the Metaculus forecast (reference point 18 Feb 2026)  \n\n\u2022 Factual status: Zero qualifying AI songs have charted on the Hot 100; the closest attempt was blocked.  \n\u2022 Institutional stance: Billboard has not banned AI songs, but its active policing of disputed content and reliance on traditional consumption metrics raise the bar compared with digital-sales lists.  \n\u2022 Trend line: Momentum is unmistakable\u2014at least one AI act has debuted on some Billboard ranking every chart week for six straight weeks (Billboard, 4 Nov 2025). Xania Monet\u2019s signing to a multimillion-dollar deal shows label muscle forming behind AI acts, which could enable the radio push and marketing spend needed for Hot 100 breakthrough in 2026-2027.  \n\n6. Summary timeline relevant to the Hot 100 (through 18 Feb 2026)  \n\nDate | AI track | Intended or rumored Hot 100 appearance | Outcome  \n-----|----------|----------------------------------------|---------  \nOct 2025 \u2192 Nov 2025 | HAVEN. \u2013 \u201cI Run\u201d | Hot 100 debut forecast by chart watchers for mid-Nov 2025 | Billboard withheld entry due to active copyright claims; 0 weeks, no peak (Billboard, 20 Nov 2025).  \n(There are no other AI-generated tracks with verified Hot 100 activity up to 18 Feb 2026.)  \n\n7. Billboard policy milestones affecting AI music  \n\n\u2022 Sep 2023: First known AI \u201cvoice-filter\u201d novelty (\u201cTrump The Don\u201d \u2013 \u201cFirst Day Out\u201d) charts on Rap Digital Song Sales, foreshadowing policy scrutiny (Billboard, 4 Nov 2025).  \n\u2022 Jun 2024\u2013present: Billboard employs AI-detection tags from partners such as Deezer for content vetting (Billboard, 4 Nov 2025).  \n\u2022 20 Oct 2025: Recurrent-rule overhaul to reduce chart congestion; while not AI-specific, the change signals ongoing maintenance of chart integrity (Billboard, 20 Oct 2025).  \n\u2022 20 Nov 2025: Copyright-dispute clause publicly cited to keep \u201cI Run\u201d off Hot 100 (Billboard, 20 Nov 2025).  \n\nConclusion  \nUp to 18 Feb 2026, the Billboard Hot 100 has yet to host an AI-created song. The absence is not from an explicit ban but from (1) Billboard\u2019s standard data-validation and copyright-clearance rules, which have already sidelined one AI track, and (2) the still-limited commercial footprint\u2014especially in U.S. radio airplay\u2014of AI acts. Nevertheless, AI music\u2019s rapid encroachment on secondary Billboard charts, combined with label investment and improving detection transparency, suggests that the qualifying breakthrough could plausibly occur before the 2027 deadline that the Metaculus community is forecasting on.</Agent_report>\n"
