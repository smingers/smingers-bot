Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary Sources (High Reliability):**

1. **FRED Database (Feb 9, 2026):** Last official data point at $64.53. Government source, highest reliability for historical data.

2. **CME Group (Feb 11, 2026):** Reports WTI rose >1.5%, up 15% YTD in 2026. Factual: EIA inventory increase of 8.5M barrels, API increase of 13.4M barrels. High reliability for market data.

3. **EIA STEO (Feb 10, 2026):** Factual: Brent averaged $67/b in January 2026; forecasts $58/b average for 2026, $53/b for 2027. Expert opinion: Expects production to exceed demand, causing inventory builds. High reliability - official government forecast.

4. **Polyestertime (Feb 18, 2026):** Factual: WTI at ~$62.56/barrel as of Feb 18. Reports U.S.-Iran diplomatic engagement easing risk premiums, OPEC+ considering April supply increases. Moderate reliability for current prices.

5. **OPEC Press Release (Feb 1, 2026):** Factual: Eight countries reaffirmed March production pause, 1.65M bpd may return gradually. Official source, high reliability.

**AskNews Articles (Feb 18, 2026):**

6. **Khaberni (Feb 18, 8:45 PM):** Factual: WTI rose ~$3 to $65.28/barrel. Recent data, moderate reliability.

7. **MarketWatch (Feb 18, 8:34 PM):** Factual: WTI surged 4.5% ($2.79) to settle at $65.05 on Feb 18, largest daily increase since Oct 23. Factual: U.S. reaffirmed military force against Iran remains option after failed nuclear talks. High reliability for price data and geopolitical facts.

11. **UrduPoint Previous Day (Feb 18, 3:40 AM):** Factual: WTI closed at $62.33 on Feb 17, lowest since Feb 2. High reliability for historical close.

12. **Hindi Moneycontrol (Feb 18, 3:09 AM):** Factual: WTI above $62, Brent above $67. Factual: Iran reached "common understanding" with Washington, will return to Geneva in two weeks. Moderate reliability.

**Key Pattern:** Multiple independent sources confirm Feb 18 saw dramatic intraday rally from ~$62.33 close (Feb 17) to $65.05-$65.28 range by end of Feb 18, driven by renewed U.S.-Iran tensions after failed nuclear talks.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Geopolitical Risk Premium Spike (Feb 18):** Multiple sources (MarketWatch, Valor, Khaberni) confirm 4.5% rally to $65.05-$65.28 on Feb 18 after U.S. reaffirmed military options against Iran. Iran announced Strait of Hormuz closure for drills. This is a clear, immediate causal mechanism with direct price impact.

2. **Structural Oversupply:** EIA official forecast (strong expert source) projects $58/b average for 2026 due to production exceeding demand. IEA data (via multiple sources) shows 3.7M bpd surplus expected. This is a structural factor with strong historical predictive power for downward pressure.

3. **Inventory Builds:** EIA reported 8.5M barrel increase (week ending Feb 6), API reported 13.4M barrel increase. Multiple independent confirmations of supply accumulation, bearish indicator.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **OPEC+ Production Pause:** Official OPEC statement confirms March pause but retains flexibility for April increases. Single reliable source, moderate impact on 8-day horizon.

2. **Recent Price Volatility:** Documented range of $61.60-$65.28 in February alone (5.6% range). Demonstrates market instability, suggests mean reversion potential.

3. **U.S.-Iran Diplomatic Cycle:** Reports of "common understanding" followed by failed talks and military posturing. Creates whipsaw effect - risk premium can evaporate as quickly as it appeared.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Technical Analysis:** Various sources cite support/resistance levels, but these are subjective and have limited predictive power over 8 days.

2. **Asian Demand:** Mentioned but not quantified with recent data for February 2026.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 8 calendar days (Feb 18 → Feb 26, 2026), approximately 6 trading days.

**If Halved (4 days):** Would weight Feb 18's geopolitical spike more heavily. Less time for mean reversion. Distribution would center higher (~$64-66) with tighter range, as structural oversupply factors have less time to manifest.

**If Doubled (16 days):** Would weight structural factors (oversupply, inventory builds) more heavily. Greater probability of mean reversion toward $60-63 range. EIA's $58 average becomes more relevant. Distribution would shift lower with wider range to account for potential OPEC+ April decisions.

**Current 8-Day Assessment:** Long enough for initial geopolitical premium to partially fade (especially if no actual military action occurs), but short enough that structural oversupply won't fully dominate. Expect consolidation between recent extremes.

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside View Established:** 10th: $59.50, 50th: ~$63.75, 90th: $68.75

**Key Shifts Warranted:**

1. **Upward Shift in Near-Term Floor (10th-40th percentiles):** The Feb 18 rally to $65.05-$65.28 represents a new technical baseline. Even with mean reversion, immediate support appears at $63-64 rather than $59-61. The geopolitical risk premium, while potentially temporary, typically takes 5-10 days to fully dissipate absent actual conflict resolution. **Shift 10th from $59.50 → $61.50; shift 40th from $63.00 → $64.00.**

2. **Moderate Upward Shift in Median (50th-60th):** Current price $65.05 is above outside view median of $63.75. While oversupply fundamentals suggest eventual decline, the 8-day horizon is too short for full mean reversion. Recent momentum and geopolitical premium provide near-term support. **Shift 50th from ~$63.75 → $64.50; shift 60th from $64.75 → $65.50.**

3. **Upward Shift in Upper Tail (80th-90th):** If Iran tensions escalate further (Strait of Hormuz actually closes beyond drills, U.S. military action begins), prices could spike to $70-75 range seen in similar historical episodes. The Axios report of "weeks-long campaign" if action occurs suggests sustained premium potential. **Shift 80th from $66.50 → $68.00; shift 90th from $68.75 → $71.00.**

**Justification for Distribution Shape:** The distribution should be slightly right-skewed (upside tail longer than downside) because:
- Geopolitical shocks create asymmetric upside risk in short timeframes
- Downside is bounded by strong support at $62-63 (recent lows)
- Upside is less bounded if conflict escalates
- 8-day horizon favors momentum over fundamentals

## Distribution Calibration

**Starting Point:** Current price $65.05 on Feb 18, 2026.

**Scenario Analysis:**

1. **Bearish Case (10th-30th percentile):** U.S.-Iran talks resume productively, risk premium evaporates, inventory data shows continued builds, technical breakdown below $63. Price retreats to $61-63 range. Probability: ~30%.

2. **Base Case (40th-60th percentile):** Geopolitical tensions simmer without escalation or resolution, price consolidates in $64-66 range with modest volatility. Neither bulls nor bears gain clear control. Probability: ~40%.

3. **Bullish Case (70th-90th percentile):** Iran tensions escalate (actual Strait closure, military incident), OPEC+ signals continued restraint, inventory data less bearish than expected. Price rallies to $67-71 range. Probability: ~30%.

**Calibration Adjustments:**
- 10th percentile: Set at $61.50 (significant de-escalation + technical breakdown)
- 20th percentile: Set at $62.75 (moderate pullback to support)
- 40th percentile: Set at $64.00 (lower end of consolidation range)
- 60th percentile: Set at $65.50 (upper end of consolidation, slight upward bias)
- 80th percentile: Set at $68.00 (renewed geopolitical premium)
- 90th percentile: Set at $71.00 (major escalation scenario)

**Implied Statistics:**
- Median (50th): ~$64.75
- Mean (approximate): ~$65.25 (right-skewed)
- Range: $61.50-$71.00 ($9.50 spread, ~15% of current price)

This represents a meaningful upward shift from the outside view, justified by:
1. Strong evidence of geopolitical risk premium already priced in
2. Technical support established at higher levels
3. Short 8-day timeframe limiting mean reversion potential
4. Asymmetric upside risk from potential conflict escalation

## Checklist:

1. **Target Variable:** WTI crude oil price ($/barrel) at Cushing, Oklahoma on Feb 26, 2026, as reported by FRED database. ✓

2. **Outside View Base Rate:** 10th: $59.50, 50th: ~$63.75, 90th: $68.75. My final prediction shifts upward (~$2-3 across distribution) due to strong evidence of geopolitical premium and technical support at higher levels. Justified by short timeframe and current market structure differing from historical average. ✓

3. **Consistency Check:** Implied median = $64.75; mean ≈ $65.25. This makes sense given current price of $65.05, recent geopolitical spike, but acknowledges downward pressure from oversupply fundamentals. Aligns with consolidation thesis. ✓

4. **Top Evidence Pieces:**
   - Feb 18 rally to $65.05 on U.S.-Iran tensions (multiple sources confirm)
   - EIA structural forecast: $58/b 2026 average due to oversupply (official)
   - 8.5M barrel inventory build week ending Feb 6 (EIA official data)
   - Iran Strait of Hormuz closure announcement for drills (factual)
   - OPEC+ March production pause with April flexibility (official statement)
   All verified as factual from reliable sources. ✓

5. **Blind-Spot Scenario:** Immediate U.S.-Iran military engagement (airstrikes begin within 8 days) would make my forecast look too conservative. This would push outcome UP to $75-80 range. Alternative blind spot: Surprise OPEC+ emergency meeting announcing immediate production increases would push DOWN to $58-60 range. Both low probability but high impact. ✓

6. **Status Quo Outcome:** Current price $65.05. Given 8-day timeframe and oil market's typical daily volatility of 1-2%, modest consolidation around current levels is reasonable base case. My distribution centers at $64.75 (slight downward nudge) acknowledging some mean reversion while respecting momentum. Appropriate for short timeframe. ✓

7. **Technicalities:** Values strictly increasing: 61.50 < 62.75 < 64.00 < 65.50 < 68.00 < 71.00. Units: Dollars per Barrel. Within bounds: Lower bound 47.71 < 61.50; Upper bound 86.08 > 71.00. ✓
