## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **8-day forward WTI price movements (Feb 18 → Feb 26):**
   - Most directly relevant timeframe
   - Historical 8-day volatility typically 2-5% in normal markets
   - Recent data shows 5% swings within single weeks

2. **End-of-month WTI prices in Q1 periods:**
   - Captures seasonal patterns
   - Q1 typically sees inventory builds, moderate demand
   - Less precise due to longer timeframe averaging

3. **WTI behavior during supply surplus periods:**
   - IEA forecasts 3.7M bpd surplus for 2026
   - Historical surpluses correlate with downward pressure
   - Relevant but medium-term factor

**Selected Reference Class:** 8-day forward price movements with consideration of current market fundamentals. This is most suitable given the short forecast horizon and need to capture near-term volatility.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 8 calendar days (Feb 18 → Feb 26, 2026), approximately 6 trading days.

**Recent Historical Patterns:**
- Feb 9-18 (6 trading days): $64.53 → $65.06 (+0.8%)
- Feb 2-9 (5 trading days): $61.60 → $64.53 (+4.8%)
- Jan 23-Feb 9 (12 trading days): $60.70 → $64.53 (+6.3%)

**8-Day Historical Volatility:**
From agent data, examining 8-calendar-day changes:
- Feb 2→Feb 10: $62.14 → $64.03 (+3.0%)
- Feb 4→Feb 12: $64.25 → $62.98 (-2.0%)
- Feb 6→Feb 14: $63.26 → $62.83 (-0.7%)
- Feb 10→Feb 18: $64.03 → $65.06 (+1.6%)

Typical 8-day range: -2% to +5%, with most moves under 3%.

## (d) Justification

**Bullish Factors:**
1. Recent momentum: Price rallied from $62.17 (Feb 17) to $65.06 (Feb 18), +4.6% in one day
2. Supply constraints: IEA reports 1.2M bpd cut in January
3. Geopolitical risk premium: Middle East tensions, though easing with Iran talks
4. Strong Asian demand absorbing supply

**Bearish Factors:**
1. Massive supply surplus: IEA forecasts 3.7M bpd oversupply for 2026
2. Inventory builds: 8.5M barrel build week ending Feb 6; another 2.3M expected
3. OPEC+ considering April production increases
4. Technical resistance at $63.50-$65 range
5. EIA long-term forecast: $58/bbl average for 2026
6. Recent volatility suggests unstable rally

**Base Case:** Current price $65.06 represents a technical bounce in a fundamentally oversupplied market. The 8-day horizon is too short for major structural changes but long enough for mean reversion or continuation of recent volatility. Given the strong bearish fundamentals (3.7M bpd surplus) versus temporary bullish catalysts (geopolitical premium, supply outages), a modest pullback or consolidation seems more likely than further rally.

**Expected Range:** $61-$68, centered around $63-$65, reflecting recent trading range with slight bearish bias.

## Outside View Calibration

**Distribution Considerations:**

1. **Central Tendency:** Recent 10-day average ~$63.50; current price $65.06 may be elevated
2. **Historical Volatility:** 1-year range $55.44-$75.89 suggests ~$20 annual range
3. **8-Day Typical Movement:** ±3% from current level = $63.11-$67.01
4. **Fundamental Anchor:** IEA's $58 2026 average suggests downward pressure, but too distant for 8-day forecast
5. **Technical Levels:** Support at $62.15, $61.13; resistance at $63.50, $65.66

**Percentile Calibration Logic:**
- 10th percentile: Significant selloff scenario (technical breakdown + inventory build news) → ~$59-60
- 50th percentile: Modest pullback to consolidation range → ~$63-64
- 90th percentile: Continued rally on geopolitical premium or supply news → ~$68-69

**Tail Risk Considerations:**
- Downside: Major geopolitical de-escalation, larger-than-expected inventory build
- Upside: Renewed Middle East crisis, unexpected supply disruption
- Historical upset rate in oil: ~20% of forecasts miss by >5%

Setting wide intervals to account for oil market's inherent volatility and recent instability.
