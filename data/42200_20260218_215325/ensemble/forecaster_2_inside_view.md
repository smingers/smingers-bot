**Expert Opinions:**

- OPEC+ delegates (identifiable): Expect continued cautious approach, maintaining production discipline

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **OPEC+ production discipline** (Feb 1 official statement): 1.65 mb/d pause confirmed through March. This structural factor supports price floor. Multiple independent confirmations (OPEC, OilPrice.com, Qazinform).
2. **Recent price action** (Feb 17-18): Sharp 4.5% swing from diplomatic signals demonstrates high sensitivity to Iran geopolitics. Multiple sources confirm $62→$65 move.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **U.S.-Iran tensions**: Renewed military rhetoric on Feb 18 after diplomatic progress Feb 17. Single-day price impact clear, but sustainability uncertain. Moderate causal link to supply risk premium.
2. **EIA surplus forecast**: Projects supply exceeding demand in 2026. Credible source (EIA), but gradual effect over months, not days.
3. **Inventory builds**: 8.5M barrel increase reported Feb 11. Moderate bearish signal, though Cushing levels historically low.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. Various analyst price targets mentioned in sources lack specific methodologies
2. Short-term technical indicators and trading volumes

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: 8 calendar days (6 trading sessions) from Feb 18 to Feb 26, 2026.

**Key scheduled events:**
- Feb 19: Weekly EIA inventory report
- Feb 26: Weekly EIA inventory report (same day as resolution)
- March 1: Next OPEC+ meeting (after resolution date)

**If timeframe halved (3-4 days)**: Prediction would narrow significantly around current $65 level. Less time for geopolitical developments or inventory surprises. Range might compress to 63-67 $/bbl.

**If timeframe doubled (16 days)**: Would need to account for March 1 OPEC+ meeting and additional inventory reports. Wider range 58-72 $/bbl to capture potential policy shifts or sustained geopolitical escalation.

**Current assessment**: 6 trading days allows for:
- 1-2 significant geopolitical headlines
- 2 EIA inventory reports (Feb 19, Feb 26)
- Normal market volatility
- But insufficient time for OPEC+ policy change or structural demand shifts

## (d) Justification for Adjusting Base Rates

**Starting point**: Current spot ≈$65/bbl (Feb 18 close)

**Base rate expectation**: Historical 6-day return distribution suggests ±7-8% moves capture 80% of outcomes → 60-70 $/bbl range.

**Factors warranting modest upward shift:**

1. **Elevated geopolitical risk premium** (moderate evidence): The Feb 18 surge demonstrates market sensitivity to Iran military risk. U.S. has deployed additional carrier, Iran conducting Strait of Hormuz exercises. This premium wasn't present in most historical 6-day periods. Shifts median up ~$1.

2. **OPEC+ production discipline** (strong evidence): Confirmed pause through March provides price floor support. Historical periods included more OPEC uncertainty. Supports slightly higher floor, lifting 10th percentile from 60→61 $/bbl.

3. **Recent momentum** (moderate evidence): +15% YTD gain and Feb 18 surge suggest near-term bullish sentiment. However, this is partially offset by:

**Factors warranting modest downward consideration:**

1. **Diplomatic progress potential**: Feb 17 showed prices can drop 2% on positive Iran news. If talks resume productively, could reverse Feb 18 gains.

2. **Inventory builds**: Rising stockpiles (8.5M barrels) suggest fundamental weakness, though effect is gradual.

3. **EIA bearish outlook**: Long-term supply surplus forecast creates headwind, though impact over 8 days is limited.

**Net assessment**: The geopolitical risk premium and OPEC+ discipline justify a modest upward shift of ~$1-2 in median relative to pure base rate, but the reference class remains broadly applicable. Current circumstances are elevated but not unprecedented (similar Iran tensions occurred in 2019, 2020). The 8-day window limits how much structural factors can dominate.

## Distribution Calibration

**Anchoring on current price**: $65/bbl (Feb 18 close)

**Base rate guidance**: ±7-8% captures normal weekly volatility → 60-70 $/bbl

**Adjustments**:
- Geopolitical premium adds ~2% upside skew
- OPEC+ floor adds ~1% to lower bound
- Diplomatic downside risk maintains some left tail

**Calibrated distribution**:
- **10th percentile (61)**: Requires positive Iran diplomatic breakthrough + bearish inventory surprise. OPEC+ floor prevents deeper drop. Historical -8% move adjusted up to -6%.
- **20th percentile (62.5)**: Modest diplomatic progress or neutral news flow. -4% move.
- **40th percentile (64)**: Slight downward drift from current level if geopolitical premium fades. -1.5% move.
- **60th percentile (66)**: Status quo with geopolitical premium maintained. +1.5% move.
- **80th percentile (68)**: Further Iran escalation or bullish inventory data. +4.5% move.
- **90th percentile (70)**: Significant military action threatened or Strait of Hormuz disruption. +7.5% move, consistent with historical 90th percentile.

This distribution centers slightly above current price (median ~65), acknowledges elevated but not extreme geopolitical risk, and maintains reasonable tails for an 8-day forecast.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable**: WTI crude oil spot price ($/barrel) at Cushing, Oklahoma on Feb 26, 2026, as published by FRED series DCOILWTICO. ✓

2. **Base rate alignment**: Historical 6-day return distribution (±7-8%) suggests 60-70 $/bbl range from $65 starting point. Final prediction (61-70) closely matches with modest upward adjustment for current geopolitical premium. ✓

3. **Consistency check**: Implied median ≈ 65 $/bbl; mean ≈ 65.3 $/bbl. Aligns with slight upward bias from geopolitical risk premium while maintaining base rate anchor. ✓

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - Feb 18 WTI surge to $65.05 on Iran military rhetoric (factual, multiple sources)
   - OPEC+ production pause confirmed through March (official statement)
   - U.S.-Iran diplomatic volatility demonstrated by Feb 17-18 price swings (factual)
   - EIA inventory build of 8.5M barrels (official data)
   - Historical 6-day volatility ±7-8% (empirical data)

5. **Blind-spot scenario**: Unexpected Iran military incident (U.S. strike or actual Strait closure) could spike prices to $75-80+. Alternatively, surprise major diplomatic breakthrough could drop to $58-60. Both low probability in 8 days but would make forecast look anchored to status quo.

6. **Status quo outcome**: Current price $65/bbl. Given 8-day window and moderate volatility environment, centering near status quo is appropriate. Distribution allows ±8% moves while acknowledging elevated geopolitical sensitivity.

7. **Technicalities**: Values strictly increasing (61 < 62.5 < 64 < 66 < 68 < 70), units in $/barrel as requested, all values within stated bounds (47.71-86.08). ✓
