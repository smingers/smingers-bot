## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **8-day forward WTI price movements (Feb 18 → Feb 26, 2026)**
   - Most directly relevant timeframe
   - Historical data shows daily volatility typically 1-3%
   - 8 trading days allows for moderate price movement but limits extreme swings

2. **Recent 1-month WTI price behavior (Jan-Feb 2026)**
   - FRED shows +9.4% monthly change recently
   - Agent data shows range of $60.46-$65.06 over ~3 weeks
   - Captures current market regime with geopolitical tensions and supply concerns

3. **Historical 8-day price changes across all periods**
   - Would include various market regimes (supply shocks, demand crashes, normal periods)
   - May be too broad given specific current fundamentals

**Selected Reference Class:** Recent 1-month behavior (Jan-Feb 2026) combined with historical 8-day volatility patterns. This captures the current market regime while recognizing that 8 days is a short timeframe limiting extreme moves.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 8 calendar days (6-7 trading days) from Feb 18 to Feb 26, 2026

**Historical Patterns:**
- Agent data shows Feb 2-18 range: $61.60-$65.06 (±2.7% from midpoint)
- FRED recent daily values show typical day-to-day changes of $0.50-$2.00
- Over 8 trading days, cumulative moves could be ±5-8% in normal conditions
- Current price (Feb 18): ~$65/bbl

**Key Events in Timeframe:**
- EIA inventory report due Feb 19 (next day) - could move market ±2%
- U.S.-Iran nuclear talks continuing (2-week timeline mentioned) - geopolitical premium could persist or fade
- OPEC+ April production decision discussions ongoing

**Seasonal/Technical Factors:**
- No major seasonal pattern in late February
- Current technical picture: Testing resistance around $65, support at $62-63
- Market appears range-bound between $60-$67 based on recent action

## (d) Justification

**Integration of Factors:**

The most reliable current price is ~$65/bbl as of Feb 18, 2026 (FRED last showed $64.53 on Feb 9; Agent/Trading Economics show $65.06/$65.00 on Feb 18).

**Bearish Factors:**
- IEA forecasts massive 3.7 Mb/d supply surplus for 2026
- Large U.S. inventory builds (+8.5 Mb/d week ending Feb 6, another +5.4 Mb/d expected)
- Record production from U.S., Brazil, Guyana
- OPEC+ considering April production increases
- U.S.-Iran nuclear talks reducing geopolitical risk premium
- EIA long-term forecast: $58/bbl average for 2026
- Technical analysts noting bearish momentum

**Bullish Factors:**
- Recent 1.2 Mb/d supply disruptions in January (IEA)
- Stronger demand from China and India
- Geopolitical tensions (though easing)
- Recent price momentum (+7.69% monthly)
- Inventories still 3% below 5-year average despite builds

**Base Case:** Given the 8-day timeframe, dramatic moves are unlikely. The market appears to be consolidating between $62-$67 with competing forces. The fundamental bearish case (oversupply) suggests downward pressure, but short-term technical support and recent momentum provide a floor. Expected range: $60-$68, with median around $63-$64.

## Outside View Calibration

**Distribution Considerations:**

1. **Central Tendency:** Current price ~$65, but fundamental bearish pressure suggests drift toward $63-64 over 8 days. Median should be slightly below current price.

2. **Volatility:** Recent 3-week range was $60.46-$65.06 (~$4.60 range). Over 8 days, expect similar or slightly narrower range given short timeframe.

3. **Tail Risks:**
   - Downside: Major geopolitical de-escalation or surprise inventory build could push toward $58-60
   - Upside: Supply disruption or geopolitical flare-up could push toward $68-70
   - Historical oil market shows ~15-20% of periods have "upset" outcomes beyond normal ranges

4. **Anchoring to Current Data:**
   - 10th percentile: Should capture downside scenario with continued selling pressure
   - 90th percentile: Should capture upside scenario with geopolitical premium
   - Must ensure strict monotonicity

5. **Reference to Bounds:** Question bounds are $47.71-$86.08. These seem very wide for 8 days. My distribution should be much tighter but acknowledge tail risks.

**Calibration Logic:**
- Current price: ~$65
- Expected slight downward drift: -$1 to -$2 over 8 days
- Standard deviation for 8-day period: ~$2-3 based on recent volatility
- 10th percentile: ~1.3 SD below median → $60-61
- 90th percentile: ~1.3 SD above median → $67-68
- Median: $63-64
