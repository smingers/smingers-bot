Analysis:
a) Source analysis (chronological, 2026 unless noted)
1. CME Group video (11 Feb): quotes WTI futures +1.5 % (~$65), cites 8.5 mb EIA build; factual market recap from a regulated exchange – reliable, contemporaneous.
2. EIA Short-Term Energy Outlook (10 Feb): official model, forecasts Brent $58 avg 2026; medium horizon, high methodological quality but less predictive for an eight-day window.
3. Polyestertime article (18 Feb): spot WTI $62.56, lists bearish supply/demand factors; niche trade press, data consistent with major feeds – moderate reliability.
4. Khaberni / MarketWatch / Valor / Kronen (18 Feb): real-time wire reports showing WTI $64–65 on 18 Feb after U.S.–Iran rhetoric hardened; multiple independent outlets, high reliability for the quoted prices.
5. UrduPoint (18 Feb a.m.) & La Libre (17 Feb): earlier-day quotes ~$62–63, reflect two-day 2 % drop on détente headlines; reliable for price prints.
6. OPEC+ press releases (Jan 4 & Feb 1): primary source on March supply pause – strong evidence of capped near-term supply.
7. InstaForex / Yahoo snippets (Jan & Dec): older inventory context; weak for an 8-day horizon.

b) Evidence analysis
Strong: 
• Multiple independent newswires confirm WTI rebounded to $64–65 on 18 Feb driven by renewed U.S.–Iran friction (price-raising).  
• OPEC+ formally pauses March production increases (supply-supportive, price-raising / at least prevents a slide).

Moderate:  
• EIA STEO projects 2026 surplus (price-lowering, but longer horizon).  
• Two consecutive U.S. inventory builds of +8 mb / +13 mb (price-lowering).

Weak:  
• Technical-analysis pieces citing support/resistance levels.  
• December–January storage anecdotes.

Net directional pull for next eight days: mild upward bias (+ geopolitics, + OPEC+ steadiness) roughly balanced by bearish inventory data ⇒ only a small upward adjustment to the base rate.

c) Timeframe analysis
Target is 8 calendar (≈6 trading) days away. With realised daily σ ≈ 2 %, 1-σ 6-day move ≈ $3.2. Halving the horizon (3 trading days) would narrow σ to ≈ $2.0; doubling (12 trading days) widens to ≈ $4.5 and would slightly increase tail weight.

d) Justification of inside-view shift
• Starting base rate from 9 Feb FRED value $64.53 and 1-yr mean $63.9.  
• Today’s spot $64–65 implies no large drift requirement.  
• Geopolitical premium re-emerged; probability of another $3+ spike (> $68) now a bit higher than a comparable $3 slide (< $61).  
• Therefore I nudge the median up about $0.75 and fatten the upper tail by ~$2 while keeping lower tail nearly unchanged.

Distribution calibration
Percentiles (Dollars per Barrel):
10th  58.00  
20th  60.50  
40th  63.80  
60th  66.20  
80th  70.00  
90th  74.00  

Implied median ≈ 65.0; mean ≈ 65.4 – consistent with justification and historic weekly volatility.

Checklist:
1. Target: FRED series DCOILWTICO daily spot price on 26 Feb 2026, $/bbl.  
2. Outside-view distribution recorded above; inside view modestly upward-skewed.  
3. Consistency line: median ≈ 65.0, mean ≈ 65.4 – aligns with evidence.  
4. Key evidence: (i) WTI prints $64–65 on 18 Feb; (ii) fresh U.S.–Iran tension; (iii) OPEC+ keeps March supply paused; (iv) recent big U.S. inventory builds.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden détente (white-smoke Iran deal) could knock $6 off prices (< 60).  
6. Status-quo bias checked – retained central value near present spot.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units correct; fall within open bounds 47.7–86.1.
