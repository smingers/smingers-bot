Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED series DCOILWTICO (last print 9 Feb 2026 = 64.53 $/bbl). – Highest-quality, definitive for resolution.  
2. CME video 11 Feb 2026 – Factual recap of futures up 1.5 %, cites EIA/API stocks. Moderate quality, timely.  
3. EIA STEO 10 Feb 2026 – Official forecast, methodology public; gives 2026 average outlook. Reliable but medium-term.  
4. Polyestertime 18 Feb 2026 – Newswire style, quotes WTI 62.56 $ and drivers; factual numbers plausible, source moderate.  
5. AskNews bundle 18 Feb 2026 – Multiple real-time wires quoting WTI intraday 64–65 $, and 4 % price jump on renewed Iran tension. Market data are factual; forward comments mostly opinion.  
6. OPEC+ press releases 1 Feb 2026 – Primary source on supply policy, high quality.  
7. Cushing inventory note 22 Jan 2026 – Single data point; weak relevance eight days ahead.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence:  
• Live spot/futures quotes today ~65 $ confirmed by four independent market feeds.  
• OPEC+ decision to keep March output capped – removes upside supply shock.  
Moderate evidence:  
• EIA/API show sizeable US stock build – mildly bearish.  
• US-Iran rhetoric re-adds small risk premium – could create short-lived spikes.  
Weak evidence:  
• Model forecasts for year-end prices; anecdotal trader sentiment.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon = 8 calendar days (≈6 trading days).  Halving (4 days) would shrink expected σ to ≈2.6 $; doubling (16 days) would raise σ to ≈5 $. Directional bias would remain slightly downward unless geopolitics change abruptly.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Base-rate distribution (past-year 8-day changes, σ≈3.6 $) centred on 64.5 $.  
Adjustments:  
• Inventories rising and IEA surplus outlook ⇒ −0.5 $.  
• Iran tension premium already priced in; 15 % chance of escalation (+3-5 $), 25 % chance of détente (-3 $) ⇒ adds small right-tail weight but nudges median down a touch.  
• No major scheduled shocks before 26 Feb.  
Net: shift centre left by ≈0.5 $, keep σ slightly fatter (≈3.9 $) to acknowledge geopolitical tail.

Distribution calibration
Percentile 10: 57.5 $ (-7 $ from centre)  
Percentile 20: 60.0 $  
Percentile 40: 62.5 $  
Percentile 60: 64.0 $  
Percentile 80: 66.0 $  
Percentile 90: 70.0 $ (+6 $ from centre)  
This widens tails ~15 % versus raw empirics while embedding a modest bearish skew.

Checklist:
1. Target: FRED daily WTI price (Dollars per Barrel) for 26 Feb 2026 close.  
2. Outside view: 10 = 58.5, 20 = 60.5, 40 = 63, 60 = 64.5, 80 = 66.5, 90 = 69.  
3. Implied median ≈ 63.3; mean ≈ 63.8; consistent with slight downside bias yet fat right tail.  
4. Key evidence: a) today’s spot ≈65 $; b) rising US inventories; c) OPEC+ output pause; d) renewed US-Iran tension.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden Strait-of-Hormuz closure sending WTI >75 $.  
6. Status-quo anchor (~65 $) considered; distribution retains 40 % probability at or above 64 $.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, units correct, within open bounds.
