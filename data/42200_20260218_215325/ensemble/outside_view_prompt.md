- Renewed geopolitical friction in the Middle East
- Disruption risks around the Strait of Hormuz added a premium to prices by threatening a key transit route for seaborne crude

Latest official EIA U.S. crude-oil inventory data  
(report week ending 2026-02-06, published 11 Feb 2026)

• Commercial crude stocks (ex-SPR): 428.8 million bbl, a weekly build of +8.5 million bbl – largest in a year and about 3 % below the 5-yr seasonal average.  
• Cushing, OK hub stocks: +1.1 million bbl (part of total build).  
• Gasoline inventories: +1.2 million bbl to 259.1 million bbl (≈4 % above 5-yr avg).  
• Distillate inventories: −2.7 million bbl to 124.7 million bbl (≈4 % below 5-yr avg).  
• Total petroleum inventories (all products): 1.689 billion bbl, down 1.7 million bbl w/w but up 81.9 million bbl y/y.  
(Key figures extracted from EIA Weekly Petroleum Status Report as summarized by TradingEconomics and Rigzone articles) (TradingEconomics; Rigzone “USA Crude Oil Stocks Rise …”, 12 Feb 2026).

Context / convergence with price action  
• The sharp crude build (+8.5 Mbbl) reported 11 Feb initially pressured prices, yet the prompt WTI spot rebounded and rallied above 65 $/bbl by 18 Feb, helped by tightening global supply (IEA estimate of a 1.2 Mb/d January outage), stronger Asian demand and elevated geopolitical risk in the Middle East (TradingEconomics commodity page, 18 Feb 2026).  
• Inventories remain slightly below normal despite the recent build, mitigating bearish impact. Forward-looking commentary from Macquarie expects another build (~+5.4 Mbbl) for the week ending 13 Feb; the next EIA release is scheduled 19 Feb (Rigzone “Strategists See 5MM Barrel WoW …”, 18 Feb 2026).

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict a true probability distribution, not a hedged smooth distribution or an overconfident extremely narrow distribution. In your thinking, always consider ranges over singular values.
(b) Are there previously established distributions that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small changes in percentile values can significantly reshape the distribution, especially near the tails. Choose tail values carefully.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your CDF distribution?

Set wide 10th/90th percentile intervals to account for unknown unknowns.

**CRITICAL: Percentile values MUST be strictly increasing** (10th = lowest, 90th = highest).
Use the units requested by the question. Never use scientific notation.
