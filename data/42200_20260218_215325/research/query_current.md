Analysis:
We need near-term information (next eight days) that could materially move WTI prices. The most relevant items are: (1) any fresh agreements, statements, or leaks from OPEC+ about March production; (2) weekly U.S. EIA inventory data due 21 Feb (and any early estimates/leaks); (3) geopolitical risk headlines—Middle-East conflict, Russia-Ukraine export disruptions, Red Sea shipping attacks; (4) U.S./global macro signals (Fed minutes, PMI releases); and (5) analyst price forecasts or options positioning for late February expiry. Search terms should surface breaking news and professional analysis on those topics.
