Analysis:
The value of WTI on 2026-02-26 will be driven by its recent trend, short-term price volatility, and any news/events (EIA inventory releases, OPEC+ announcements, geopolitical shocks) occurring between now and the resolve date.  
To build an outside view I first want:  
• A long-run daily history of WTI so I can measure typical one-week volatility and mean-reversion behaviour.  
• Current news coverage and market commentary focused on late-February 2026 expectations.  
• The latest daily observations (Feb 1 – 18 2026) and the most recent U.S. inventory numbers, since inventory surprises often shift prices in the following days.  
• Direct access to the FRED series for quick descriptive statistics.
