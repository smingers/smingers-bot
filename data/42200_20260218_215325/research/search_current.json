Geopolitical Developments\n- Recent U.S.-Iran diplomatic engagement in Geneva regarding Iran's nuclear program has eased supply risk premiums\n- Temporary disruptions occurred in the Strait of Hormuz, but overall geopolitical risk has decreased\n- This easing of risk has pushed both Brent and WTI prices downward\n\n### 2.

The United Arab Emirates announced it would withdraw forces from Yemen following heightened tensions with Saudi Arabia over military operations in the country. Meanwhile, President Donald Trump's efforts to end the war in Ukraine faced setbacks after Russian President Vladimir Putin stated he would revise his negotiating stance. Despite these risks, OPEC+ delegates expect the group to maintain its current policy of pausing further supply increases, as evidence of a growing global crude surplus mounts. Data from Vortexa Ltd. shows rising volumes of oil on idle tankers, signaling excess supply. The Trump administration's partial U.S. blockade on Venezuela has disrupted exports, prompting President Nicolas Maduro to shut down oil wells and fill domestic storage tanks\u2014a sign of economic strain.

WTI serves as a benchmark price for crude oil in the United States, valued for its low density and low sulfur content, making it ideal for gasoline refining. The commodity is sourced from oil fields in Texas, North Dakota, and Louisiana, with Cushing, Oklahoma, as its primary trading hub. Historically, WTI reached a record low of $11 per barrel in December 1998 and a record high of $147.27 in June 2008. After peaking, prices dropped to $37.80 in early 2009. In 2017, the average WTI price was $50.84 per barrel; in 2018, it rose to $67.22; and in 2019, it closed at $61 per barrel. Although WTI is considered the highest-quality light sweet crude, it is not the most widely used globally due to its land-locked supply, which limits transportation compared to water-borne Brent crude. From the early 2000s, the Shale Revolution and increased Canadian imports caused WTI to trade at a discount to Brent and the OPEC basket. The price of US crude oil is heavily influenced by the performance of the US economy and the fundamental forces of supply and demand, with tight supplies typically driving prices upward.

The American Petroleum Institute (API) reported a decrease of 1.8 million barrels at the Cushing, Oklahoma, crude oil hub last week, alongside declines in product inventories such as gasoline. Although nationwide crude stockpiles are estimated to have increased, they remain near seasonal lows, contributing to market focus on global supply dynamics. The data release came amid ongoing scrutiny of U.S. inventory levels and global oil supply outlooks.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 08, 2025 06:39 AM\nSource:[Financial Post](https://financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/oil-gains-with-us-inventories-and-global-supply-outlook-in-focus)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
