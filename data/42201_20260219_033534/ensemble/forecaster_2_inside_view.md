## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Ex-dividend mechanical effect (-0.58%)**: The $0.455 dividend on $78.56 base = 0.58% markdown on Feb 24. This is a structural, predictable effect with decades of empirical support. **Impact: -11 percentage points from 52% baseline.**

2. **Recent earnings beat and guidance raise**: Q3 beat by $0.04, Q4 guidance raised to $1.26B (6.2% sequential growth). Multiple analyst upgrades following. Historical post-earnings-announcement drift studies show +0.05%/day for ~20 days. **Impact: +1.5 pts over 3 pre-ex days.**

**Moderate Evidence:**
3. **Institutional accumulation**: Multiple institutions increased stakes in Q3 2025 (NEOS +68%, new positions from First National Bank). 91.51% institutional ownership suggests conviction. However, this is backward-looking (Q3 data) and already priced in. **Impact: +0.5 pts for momentum continuation.**

4. **Convertible debt offering (Feb 9)**: $600M offering caused -2.1% drop, signaling dilution concerns. However, proceeds used for debt reduction (net debt/EBITDA improved to 4.18). Market already digested this news. **Impact: Neutral to slightly negative, already reflected in price.**

**Weak Evidence:**
5. **Analyst targets averaging $86**: Represents +9.4% upside from $78.56, but these are 12-month targets, not 4-day forecasts. Limited relevance for short horizon. **Impact: +0.5 pts for sentiment.**

6. **Insider selling**: CFO sold 4,292 shares (-12.48% of holdings), CEO sold 98,814 shares (-0.99%). Routine diversification or concerning? Amounts are modest relative to holdings. **Impact: -0.5 pts for mild negative signal.**

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Timeframe:** 4 trading days (Feb 19 close → Feb 25 close)

**Critical Event:** Ex-dividend date falls on Feb 24 (Monday), which is day 3 of the 4-day window.

**If halved to 2 days (Feb 19 → Feb 21):**
- Would miss the ex-dividend effect entirely
- Post-earnings drift would dominate (+0.10% over 2 days)
- Market momentum would add +0.04%
- Probability would rise to ~52-53% (near baseline)

**If doubled to 8 days (Feb 19 → Mar 3):**
- Ex-dividend effect diluted across longer horizon (still -0.58% but over 8 days)
- More time for post-earnings drift (+0.40% cumulative)
- More market noise (σ increases to ~2.8%)
- Probability would rise to ~48-49% as dividend drag is spread thinner

**Key insight:** The 4-day window is uniquely disadvantaged by having the ex-dividend date on day 3, leaving only 1 day for recovery.

## (d) Justification

**Starting point:** Outside view base rate of 43.2% already incorporates:
- Baseline 4-day up-probability: 52%
- Dividend markdown: -11 pts → 41%
- Post-earnings drift: +1.5 pts → 42.5%
- Market momentum: +1 pt → 43.5%

**Inside view adjustments:**

1. **Institutional buying signal (+0.5 pts):** Multiple new positions and stake increases in recent quarters suggest informed conviction. While lagged, the pattern of accumulation into Feb 2026 (per Defense World articles) suggests continued support. Modest adjustment warranted.

2. **Analyst upgrade momentum (+0.5 pts):** Four major upgrades post-earnings with targets $80-$100. While these are long-term, they create near-term positive sentiment and potential short covering. Small adjustment.

3. **Convertible offering overhang (-0.5 pts):** The Feb 9 offering and associated hedging activity may create residual selling pressure through Feb. Stock declined 2.1% on announcement and has been consolidating since. Modest negative.

4. **Insider selling signal (-0.3 pts):** While amounts are small, the timing (post-earnings, near 52-week high) suggests insiders see limited near-term upside. Very small adjustment.

**Net inside view adjustment:** +0.2 pts (from +0.5 +0.5 -0.5 -0.3)

**However, key consideration:** The outside view already incorporated "mild post-earnings drift" and "market momentum." The inside view evidence largely confirms rather than contradicts these assumptions. The institutional buying and analyst upgrades are manifestations of the post-earnings drift already modeled. The convertible offering and insider selling are new negatives not in the outside view.

**Revised calculation:**
- Outside view: 43.2%
- Inside view adjustment: +0.2 pts (confirming evidence) - 0.5 pts (new negatives) = -0.3 pts
- **Final: 42.9%**

Rounding to 43% to avoid false precision.

## Probability Calibration

The outside view of 43.2% is well-grounded in the mechanical ex-dividend effect, which dominates this short timeframe. The inside view evidence largely confirms the assumptions already embedded in the outside view (post-earnings momentum, market strength) while adding modest new negatives (convertible offering, insider selling).

**Key calibration points:**
- At 43%, I'm saying that in 43 out of 100 similar situations (S&P 500 stock, 4-day window including ex-dividend day, recent earnings beat), the stock finishes higher.
- This implies the dividend effect is the dominant factor, overcoming the typical positive drift.
- A shift to 33% would require believing the dividend effect is even larger or that additional negatives (e.g., sector rotation, macro shock) are imminent. Current evidence doesn't support this.
- A shift to 53% would require believing the post-earnings momentum fully offsets the dividend. This contradicts decades of ex-dividend research.

The 43% forecast feels appropriately anchored to the structural dividend effect while giving modest credit to positive momentum.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Will MCHP close higher on Feb 25 than Feb 19 (4 trading days)? Ex-dividend date Feb 24 creates -0.58% mechanical drag.

2. **Base rate:** Outside view base rate is 43.2%, driven primarily by the ex-dividend markdown effect (-11 pts from 52% baseline), partially offset by post-earnings drift (+1.5 pts) and market momentum (+1 pt).

3. **Consistency:** "43 out of 100 times, MCHP closes higher on Feb 25 than Feb 19." This aligns with the dividend being the dominant factor in a 4-day window, with modest positive momentum insufficient to overcome it.

4. **Top evidence:**
   - Ex-dividend date Feb 24 creates -0.58% structural markdown (Strong, factual)
   - Q3 earnings beat by $0.04 with raised guidance drives post-earnings drift (Strong, factual)
   - Institutional accumulation continues through Q3 2025 (Moderate, lagged but factual)
   - $600M convertible offering Feb 9 caused -2.1% drop (Moderate, factual)
   - Insider selling by CFO and CEO in recent quarter (Weak, routine amounts)

5. **Blind spot:** Market-wide rally driven by unexpected positive macro news (e.g., Fed pivot signal, geopolitical resolution) could create +2-3% tailwind that overwhelms the dividend drag. This would push probability to ~55-60%. Probability of such event in 4 days: ~5-10%.

6. **Status quo:** Current price of $78.56 is consolidating near recent highs after the Feb 9 convertible offering dip. Absent the dividend, status quo suggests continuation of this consolidation (50/50). The dividend effect is the key deviation from status quo, justifying the below-50% forecast.

Probability: 43%
