## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **Short-term (4-6 trading day) stock price movements for individual S&P 500 stocks**
   - Most suitable for this question
   - Typical daily volatility for tech stocks ~1-2%
   - Over 4 trading days, random walk suggests roughly 50% probability of up/down
   - However, momentum and recent trends can shift this baseline

2. **MCHP-specific short-term price movements**
   - Limited data in sources, but shows strong 2026 momentum (+24% YTD)
   - Recent trading: $78.56 (Feb 16) → $78.95 (Feb 18) → $79.11 (Feb 18 close)
   - Upward trend evident in recent days

3. **Semiconductor sector short-term movements**
   - Relevant given MCHP's industry
   - Sector showing recovery after 2024-2025 downturn
   - Broader tech sector volatility moderate recently

**Selected reference class:** Short-term individual stock movements with momentum adjustment

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 4 trading days (Feb 19 close → Feb 25 close)

**Key temporal factors:**
- Ex-dividend date: Feb 23, 2026 (dividend of $0.455/share = ~0.58% of current price)
- Stocks typically drop by dividend amount on ex-date, creating downward pressure
- Question asks if Feb 25 close > Feb 19 close
- Feb 19 close is unknown but likely near $79 based on Feb 18 close of $79.11

**Historical patterns:**
- MCHP showed strong upward momentum in early 2026 (+24% YTD through Feb 18)
- Recent daily moves: relatively stable around $78-79 range
- 52-week high of $83.35 provides resistance ~5% above current levels
- Technical resistance noted at $80 level

**Ex-dividend impact:**
- On Feb 23 (ex-date), stock should theoretically drop by ~$0.46
- If Feb 19 close is ~$79, ex-dividend adjustment would push toward ~$78.54
- Recovery to above Feb 19 level by Feb 25 would require ~$0.50+ gain in 2 days post-ex-date

## (d) Justification

**Bullish factors:**
- Strong momentum: +24% YTD, consistent upward trend
- Beat earnings and guidance in recent report (Feb 5)
- Positive analyst sentiment: 72% positive ratings, $85 consensus target
- Institutional buying resumed in January 2026
- CEO and management expressing confidence in sustained growth
- Strong bookings and backlog reported

**Bearish factors:**
- Ex-dividend date Feb 23 creates mechanical downward pressure (~0.58%)
- Recent insider selling (Feb 17)
- Technical resistance at $80 level
- Stock near 52-week high, limited room to $83.35 ceiling
- Broader market showing some weakness (-0.8% over past month)
- Short timeframe (4 days) limits recovery time post-ex-dividend

**Critical consideration:** The ex-dividend date is the dominant factor for this short timeframe. The stock will mechanically drop by approximately the dividend amount ($0.455) on Feb 23. For the Feb 25 close to exceed the Feb 19 close, the stock must:
1. Either not drop the full dividend amount on ex-date (unusual), or
2. Rally significantly on Feb 24-25 to recover the dividend drop plus any other losses

Given only 2 trading days (Feb 24-25) after the ex-dividend date to recover, and typical post-ex-dividend behavior, this creates a structural headwind.

Outside view calibration:

**Base rate considerations:**
- Random walk baseline for 4-day period: ~50%
- Momentum adjustment (strong YTD performance): +5-10 percentage points
- Ex-dividend adjustment: -15-20 percentage points (significant mechanical effect)
- Technical resistance at $80: -5 percentage points
- Positive fundamental outlook: +5 percentage points

**Rough anchors from sources:**
- No specific probability estimates provided
- Analyst targets suggest 8-10% upside over longer horizons, not 4 days
- Recent daily volatility suggests ±1-2% moves are typical

**Calibration:**
Starting from 50% base rate:
- Strong momentum: +8% → 58%
- Ex-dividend mechanical effect: -18% → 40%
- Limited recovery time (2 days post-ex): -5% → 35%
- Positive fundamentals partially offset: +3% → 38%

The ex-dividend date is the critical factor. Historical patterns show stocks typically don't fully recover dividend drops within 2 trading days. While MCHP has strong momentum, the mechanical adjustment on Feb 23 combined with only 2 recovery days makes it more likely the Feb 25 close will be below the Feb 19 close.

**Domain upset rate:** Individual stock movements over 4-day periods are inherently noisy. Approximately 40-45% of stocks with similar momentum profiles still decline over short periods despite positive trends. The ex-dividend factor increases this upset probability.
