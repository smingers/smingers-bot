Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most-salient to the 6-day window)

1. Yahoo Finance quote page, 18 Feb 26 – Factual: last close $78.56, ex-div date 23 Feb; 52-wk hi $83.35.  High-quality market data, no opinions.
2. Microchip Q3-FY26 earnings release & call, 5-6 Feb 26 (GlobeNewswire, Motley Fool, Yahoo Finance) – Factual: sales +15.6 % y/y, EPS beat, March-qtr guidance +6 % q/q; dividend $0.455 declared.  Primary source, strong quality; management’s optimism is opinion.
3. Stock Titan / GlobeNewswire, 9 Feb 26 – Factual: $600 m convertible-note offering; price fell ~2 %.  Reliable PR wire.
4. Stockpulse price blips, 16-18 Feb 26 – Factual intraday %-moves; thin commentary.  Quality acceptable for prices only.
5. DefenceWorld / MarketBeat round-ups, 17-18 Feb 26 – Institution accumulation, analyst targets $86–$100.  Secondary, mildly promotional.
6. S&P 500 series (FRED) to 18 Feb 26 – Index drift flat/-0.3 % m/m.  High quality macro data.
No other sources add materially new, near-term price drivers.

Factual vs opinion: Only items 2 & 3 contain corporate facts that can reasonably move price over the coming four trading days; analyst price targets and institution trades are opinions/lagging indicators.

(b) Evidence analysis (weighing)
Strong evidence
• Ex-dividend mechanics: on 23 Feb the price will open lower by ≈$0.455 (-0.58 %).  Direct, unavoidable, well-documented.  
Moderate evidence
• Recent earnings beat & upbeat guidance imply fundamental momentum; historically this biases next-few-week returns modestly positive for semis.
• Convertible‐note issue created a negative 2 % shock on 9 Feb; overhang persists (possible further hedging/dilution selling through 25 Feb).
Weak evidence
• Analyst upgrades / institutional buys – backward-looking.
• General tech/AI strength – macro tail-wind but low predictive power over 4 trading days.

Net directional weights: 1 strong bearish (ex-div), 1 moderate bullish (earnings momentum), 1 moderate bearish (convertible overhang) → tilt slightly bearish vs a 50 % coin-flip.

(c) Timeframe analysis
Resolution window: close of 19 Feb vs close of 25 Feb = 4 trading days, 6 calendar days.
If the horizon were halved (to 2 days) probability of “Yes” would drop further (~40 %) because the drop from the ex-div would still occur but there’d be even less time to rebound.  
If doubled (to 8 days) probability would rise (~49–50 %) as normal drift and post-dividend mean-reversion have more time.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment
Outside-view base rate (large-cap U.S. equity, 4-day horizon) ≈52 % up-move.
-1.5 pp: Semiconductor beta (>1) raises volatility → drift less important → back to ~50.5 %.
-4.0 pp: Mechanical $0.455 ex-div drop (-0.6 %) exceeds expected 4-day index drift (~+0.3 %); pushes probability below 50.
+1.5 pp: Fresh earnings beat, book-to-bill>1, analyst sentiment can spark follow-through buying.
-2.0 pp: Convertible-note hedge selling & dilution angst linger.
Net shift -5 pp from the original 52 % → 47 %.  
Considering slight downward momentum since the 12 Feb high and thin macro impetus, I apply an additional -4 pp discretion.  

Probability calibration
Final inside-view probability that MCHP’s 25 Feb 26 close is above its 19 Feb 26 close: 43 %.  
“Roughly 43 times out of 100 in similar circumstances, the 25 Feb closing price would end higher.”

Checklist:
1. Restated question: Will MCHP close higher on 25 Feb 26 than on 19 Feb 26 (4 trading-day gap)?  
2. Outside-view base 52 % (S&P-500 4-day direction).  
3. Consistency test: “43 out of 100 times the 25 Feb price beats 19 Feb.” – passes intuition.  
4. Key evidence:  
   • $0.455 ex-div 23 Feb (strong, bearish).  
   • Q3 beat & strong guidance (moderate, bullish).  
   • $600 m convertible note overhang (moderate, bearish).  
   • Recent pullback from 52-wk high (weak-moderate, bearish).  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden sector/AI rally of >3 % between 24–25 Feb could swamp ex-div hit; would raise Yes odds above 60 %.  
6. Status-quo drift small; slight lean to “No” matches check.

Probability: 43%
