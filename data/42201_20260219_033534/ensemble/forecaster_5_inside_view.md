Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (abridged to the most decision-relevant items)

1. GlobeNewswire press release, 9 Feb 2026 – company-authorised notice of $600 m convertible notes.  High factual reliability; short-term share overhang typically modestly negative.
2. Q3-FY26 earnings call transcript (Motley Fool & Yahoo Finance synopses), 5-6 Feb 2026 – official numbers, guidance for March qtr.  Very reliable; guidance upbeat (+6 % seq. sales, EPS $0.48-0.52).
3. Stockpulse price/volume cards, 16-18 Feb 2026 – machine-generated but sourced from real-time exchanges; good for recent price levels (last close $78.56 on 17 Feb).
4. DefenceWorld institutional-flow notes, 17-18 Feb 2026 – SEC filing–derived, reliable; show steady accumulation by funds, analyst targets $86-100 (moderately positive sentiment).
5. Dividend schedule: ex-dividend $0.455 on 23 Feb 2026 (confirmed via Nasdaq calendar).  Pure fact.
6. Macro backdrop: S&P 500 near ATH (FRED data) and Philadelphia Semiconductor Index +3 % MTD (Bloomberg, 18 Feb).  Reliable; supportive for semis.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong:
• Ex-dividend mechanically cuts the 23 Feb open by ≈$0.455 (-0.58 %).  
Moderate:
• Upbeat guidance + bullish sector momentum (earnings call + SOX trend) – adds upward drift.  
• Institutional net buying and new analyst price-target raises – sentiment tail-wind.  
Weak:
• Convertible note overhang (9 Feb) – already digested, impact fading.  
• Minor insider sales – typical for MCHP, weak signal.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast horizon: 4 trading days (20, 23, 24, 25 Feb).  Halving to 2 days would raise importance of the dividend drop and lower recovery odds → probability ~45 %.  Doubling to 8 days would give the stock more time to claw back the dividend and track macro tape → probability ~52 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view base rate (MCHP 4-day historical “up” frequency 2016-25): 52 %.  
Detractors:  
• Mandatory 0.58 % dividend markdown ≈ 0.13 σ of 4-day volatility → -3 ppts.  
• No scheduled positive catalyst.  
Adders:  
• Sector + macro bullish drift (SOX + guidance) ~ +1.5 ppts.  
Net shift: 52 – 3 + 1.5 ≈ 50.5 % → round to 47 – 49 % after allowing slight downside bias from lingering note-offering hang-over.  I centre on 48 %.

Probability calibration
“I expect that 48 out of 100 times MCHP will close higher on 25 Feb than on 19 Feb.”

Checklist:
1. Question restated: Will MCHP’s 25 Feb 2026 close exceed its 19 Feb 2026 close?  
2. Base rate stated: 52 % (4-day historical).  
3. Consistency line above.  
4. Key evidence (≤20 w each):  
   • 23 Feb ex-dividend knocks price -0.58 %.  
   • Bullish FY26-Q4 guidance, bookings strong.  
   • SOX index up, macro risk-on.  
   • Recent fund inflows/analyst upgrades.  
5. Blind-spot: Material takeover rumour or AI-chip headline sending semis +5 % in a day.  Would push chance >60 %.  
6. Status-quo tilt: short horizon, noise dominates → stay near 50 %.

Probability: 48%
