<Agent_report>
Query: Retrieve daily closing prices for Microchip Technology (MCHP) from 2024-01-01 to 2026-02-18, calculate average 4-trading-day return and standard deviation, and list any earnings releases or guidance updates in Feb 2026
1. Daily-price coverage obtained so far  
• StockAnalysis.com exposes a “Stock Price History” table that includes a continuous, date-stamped record of open, high, low, close and adjusted-close prices for MCHP (NASDAQ) back to 1993 (StockAnalysis). The excerpt returned in the search results shows daily observations from 2025-12-05 through 2026-02-18.  
• Macrotrends provides only annual summary rows, not individual trading-day data, so it cannot be used to calculate multi-day returns (Macrotrends).  
• No other source in the current result set provides the missing 2024 and 2025 daily closes.

Because the StockAnalysis excerpt stops at 2025-12-05, approximately 495 trading days—2024-01-02 through 2025-12-04—are still absent.  Without a complete, gap-free series the requested statistics (average 4-trading-day holding-period return and its standard deviation for 2024-01-02 → 2026-02-18) cannot be computed to specification.  Additional price rows from StockAnalysis.com (or an equivalent full CSV from Yahoo Finance, Microchip’s IR “Historical Data” page, or another credentialed feed) are therefore still required.

2. Earnings releases and guidance updates issued in February 2026  
A single investor-relations event falls inside the target month:
• 5 February 2026 – FY-2026 third-quarter results and outlook.  Microchip reported December-quarter (fiscal Q3) net sales of $1.186 bn (+4 % q/q, +15.6 % y/y) and non-GAAP EPS of $0.44, exceeding the mid-point of prior guidance by $0.04.  Management guided for March-quarter (fiscal Q4) net sales of $1.26 bn ± $20 m, non-GAAP EPS of $0.48–0.52, and non-GAAP gross margin of 60.5–61.5 %.  Commentary cited progress on inventory normalization and “a strong December book-to-bill” (Globe and Mail transcript; StockTitan press release — both dated 5 Feb 2026).  

No other February-2026 earnings releases, business-updates or formal guidance bulletins were returned in the search corpus.

3. Ability to deliver the requested statistics  
• Required input: 519 consecutive adjusted closing prices covering 2 January 2024 through 18 February 2026.  
• Data currently in hand: 54 daily observations (5 Dec 2025–18 Feb 2026).  
⇒ Roughly 90 % of the sample is still missing, so neither the mean four-day return nor its standard deviation can be produced yet.  Any computation based on the partial series would be statistically invalid and would not satisfy the stated deliverable.

4. Outstanding information gap  
Full daily adjusted-close history for MCHP from 2 Jan 2024 to 4 Dec 2025 remains to be collected.  Once those rows are secured, the 4-trading-day overlapping returns ( r_t = Close_t / Close_{t-4} – 1 ) can be computed for t = 6 Jan 2024 through 18 Feb 2026, yielding 515 observations from which to calculate the sample mean and sample standard deviation.

– StockAnalysis: “Microchip Technology (MCHP) Stock Price History 1993-2026” (StockAnalysis)  
– Macrotrends: “Microchip Technology – 33-Year Stock Price History” (Macrotrends)

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of an event occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Is there a rough figure in the sources you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability?

Format your answer as below:

Analysis:
{Insert your analysis here, following the above components.}

Outside view calibration:

Outside View Prediction:
Provide your outside view prediction as a percentage. Be precise — don't round to multiples of 5%.
