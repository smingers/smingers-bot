Daily-price coverage obtained so far  \n\u2022 StockAnalysis.com exposes a \u201cStock Price History\u201d table that includes a continuous, date-stamped record of open, high, low, close and adjusted-close prices for MCHP (NASDAQ) back to 1993 (StockAnalysis). The excerpt returned in the search results shows daily observations from 2025-12-05 through 2026-02-18.  \n\u2022 Macrotrends provides only annual summary rows, not individual trading-day data, so it cannot be used to calculate multi-day returns (Macrotrends).  \n\u2022 No other source in the current result set provides the missing 2024 and 2025 daily closes.\n\nBecause the StockAnalysis excerpt stops at 2025-12-05, approximately 495 trading days\u20142024-01-02 through 2025-12-04\u2014are still absent.  Without a complete, gap-free series the requested statistics (average 4-trading-day holding-period return and its standard deviation for 2024-01-02 \u2192 2026-02-18) cannot be computed to specification.  Additional price rows from StockAnalysis.com (or an equivalent full CSV from Yahoo Finance, Microchip\u2019s IR \u201cHistorical Data\u201d page, or another credentialed feed) are therefore still required.\n\n2. Earnings releases and guidance updates issued in February 2026  \nA single investor-relations event falls inside the target month:\n\u2022 5 February 2026 \u2013 FY-2026 third-quarter results and outlook.  Microchip reported December-quarter (fiscal Q3) net sales of $1.186 bn (+4 % q/q, +15.6 % y/y) and non-GAAP EPS of $0.44, exceeding the mid-point of prior guidance by $0.04.  Management guided for March-quarter (fiscal Q4) net sales of $1.26 bn \u00b1 $20 m, non-GAAP EPS of $0.48\u20130.52, and non-GAAP gross margin of 60.5\u201361.5 %.  Commentary cited progress on inventory normalization and \u201ca strong December book-to-bill\u201d (Globe and Mail transcript; StockTitan press release \u2014 both dated 5 Feb 2026).  \n\nNo other February-2026 earnings releases, business-updates or formal guidance bulletins were returned in the search corpus.\n\n3. Ability to deliver the requested statistics  \n\u2022 Required input: 519 consecutive adjusted closing prices covering 2 January 2024 through 18 February 2026.  \n\u2022 Data currently in hand: 54 daily observations (5 Dec 2025\u201318 Feb 2026).  \n\u21d2 Roughly 90 % of the sample is still missing, so neither the mean four-day return nor its standard deviation can be produced yet.  Any computation based on the partial series would be statistically invalid and would not satisfy the stated deliverable.\n\n4. Outstanding information gap  \nFull daily adjusted-close history for MCHP from 2 Jan 2024 to 4 Dec 2025 remains to be collected.  Once those rows are secured, the 4-trading-day overlapping returns ( r_t = Close_t / Close_{t-4} \u2013 1 ) can be computed for t = 6 Jan 2024 through 18 Feb 2026, yielding 515 observations from which to calculate the sample mean and sample standard deviation.\n\nSources  \n\u2013 StockAnalysis: \u201cMicrochip Technology (MCHP) Stock Price History 1993-2026\u201d (StockAnalysis)  \n\u2013 Macrotrends: \u201cMicrochip Technology \u2013 33-Year Stock Price History\u201d (Macrotrends)  \n\u2013 Globe and Mail/StockTitan press materials, 5 Feb 2026, summarising Q3-FY26 earnings release and guidance (cited in prior research and reaffirmed here)\n\nNo further conclusions can be drawn until the missing price data are procured.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"SP500\" query=\"SP500\">\nFRED Economic Data: S&P 500\nSeries ID: SP500\nUnits: Index\nFrequency: Daily, Close\nLatest observation: 6881.31 (2026-02-18)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=6330.70, min=4982.77, max=6978.60\n- 5-year: mean=4938.16, min=3577.03, max=6978.60\n- 10-year: mean=3834.96, min=1921.27, max=6978.60\n- All-time: mean=3834.20, min=1917.78, max=6978.60 (since 2016-02-19)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: -58.70 (-0.8%)\n- 3-month change: +342.55 (+5.2%)\n- 6-month change: +414.40 (+6.4%)\n- Year-over-year: 6881.31 vs 6129.58 (+12.3%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily, Close):\nDate,Value\n2026-02-02,6976.44\n2026-02-03,6917.81\n2026-02-04,6882.72\n2026-02-05,6798.40\n2026-02-06,6932.30\n2026-02-09,6964.82\n2026-02-10,6941.81\n2026-02-11,6941.47\n2026-02-12,6832.76\n2026-02-13,6836.17\n2026-02-17,6843.22\n2026-02-18,6881.31\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
