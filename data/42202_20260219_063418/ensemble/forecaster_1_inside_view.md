Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles (PBS, CNBC, WDBJ7 - Feb 18-19, 2026):**
These sources report on Wexner's congressional deposition that occurred on February 18, 2026. PBS and CNBC are high-quality national news outlets; WDBJ7/AP provides wire service coverage. All confirm: 6-hour closed-door testimony, Wexner denied wrongdoing, claimed he was "duped" by Epstein, and Democratic Representatives (Garcia, Min) expressed strong skepticism. **Factual consensus**: Deposition occurred Feb 18; video/transcript release described as "soon" but no date confirmed. **Opinion sources**: Rep. Garcia (named, reliable) stated Wexner was "Jeffrey Epstein's single largest benefactor" and questioned credibility of denials.

**Web Articles (UPI, The Lantern, Sportico - Jan-Feb 2026):**
These cover the separate Ohio State University/Dr. Strauss lawsuit. UPI and Sportico (Feb 11-12) report court ordered Wexner deposition within 60 days (by ~April 12), not yet scheduled. The Lantern (Jan 29) covers Wexner's motion to quash, which was denied. **Factual**: OSU lawsuit is separate matter; no deposition scheduled in Feb 19-25 window.

**AskNews Articles (Feb 18-19, 2026):**
Multiple international sources (Straits Times, mint, RT Arabic, CNN, Forbes, Jerusalem Post) all covering the Feb 18 congressional testimony. CNN provides most detailed analysis of DOJ files showing "sustained federal interest" in Wexner. All sources confirm same basic facts: testimony occurred Feb 18, Wexner denied knowledge, Democrats skeptical. **Quality**: High-credibility international outlets with consistent factual reporting. **Opinion sources**: Rep. Garcia and Rep. Min (named, reliable) both questioned Wexner's credibility.

**Older AskNews Articles (Oct-Dec 2025):**
Victoria's Secret fashion show coverage and Google Trends 2025 year-end reports. Not directly relevant to Feb 19-25 window.

**Key Factual Consensus:**
- Feb 18 deposition is confirmed past event
- National/international media coverage on Feb 18-19
- Video/transcript release timing: "soon" but unscheduled
- No other confirmed events in Feb 19-25 window
- Current Google Trends value (Feb 19): 19

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **Multiple independent sources confirm Feb 18 deposition occurred** - This is a completed event, not a future catalyst. The immediate news cycle (Feb 18-19) is captured in the current value of 19.

2. **Historical Google Trends pattern shows rapid post-spike decay** - From peak of 100 (Feb 11) to 19 (Feb 19) over 8 days. The 7-day rolling average dropped from 33.9 to 13.0, indicating strong downward momentum.

3. **Base rate: 85% of 6-day windows show ≤3 point change** - This is the strongest statistical anchor from the outside view.

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **Video/transcript release described as "imminent" but unscheduled** - Rep. Comer (reliable source, Feb 19) said release would happen "soon." This creates uncertainty: if released during Feb 19-25, could spike interest; if not, natural decay continues.

2. **Current value (19) above recent 7-day average (13)** - Suggests Feb 19 value may still reflect tail-end of Feb 18 news coverage, with room to decay toward baseline.

3. **News cycle timing** - Feb 19 is Day 2 after deposition. Typical pattern: Day 1-2 see peak coverage, Days 3-7 see decay unless new material emerges.

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **Democratic Representatives' skepticism** - While newsworthy, this is opinion/reaction rather than new factual revelation. Unlikely to generate sustained new search interest beyond initial coverage.

2. **OSU Strauss lawsuit** - Court ordered deposition within 60 days, but no specific date. Unlikely to impact Feb 19-25 window.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: February 19 (today) to February 25 (6 days)

**Resolution criteria**: Compare Google Trends value on Feb 25 to Feb 19 (currently 19). 
- "Doesn't change": Feb 25 value between 16-22 (within 3 points)
- "Increases": Feb 25 value ≥23 (more than 3 points higher)
- "Decreases": Feb 25 value ≤15 (more than 3 points lower)

**If timeframe halved (3 days to Feb 22):**
Would increase "Doesn't change" probability to ~75%, as less time for either decay or new catalyst. Natural decay over 3 days less likely to exceed 3-point threshold.

**If timeframe doubled (12 days to March 3):**
Would increase "Decreases" probability to ~50-60%, as more time for natural decay toward baseline (7-day average of 13). Also more time for potential video release, slightly increasing "Increases" probability.

## (d) Justification

**Factors supporting "Doesn't change" (base rate 85%):**
- Strong statistical anchor: 85% of historical 6-day windows show ≤3 point change
- Current value (19) is only 6 points above recent average (13), so natural decay of 1-2 points over 6 days would keep within threshold
- No confirmed scheduled events for Feb 19-25
- News cycles typically stabilize 2-3 days after major events

**Factors supporting "Decreases" (shift from 6% base rate to ~25%):**
- **Strong evidence**: Clear downward trend from 100→19 over 8 days, with 7-day average declining from 33.9 to 13.0
- **Moderate evidence**: Current value (19) is 46% above recent average (13), suggesting overcorrection that will revert
- **Moderate evidence**: Feb 19 value likely captures tail-end of Feb 18 coverage; Days 3-6 (Feb 20-25) typically see continued decay
- Natural decay of 4-5 points over 6 days would bring value to 14-15, triggering "Decreases"

**Factors supporting "Increases" (shift from 9% base rate to ~15%):**
- **Moderate evidence**: Video/transcript release described as "imminent" by Rep. Comer (reliable source)
- If released during Feb 19-25, would provide new primary source material for media analysis
- However, timing uncertainty is high; "soon" could mean next week or next month
- Would require 4+ point increase (to ≥23) from current 19

**Critical assessment of reference class applicability:**
The 85% base rate comes from "all 6-day windows" but current context is "immediate post-major-news-event." In such contexts, decay is more predictable and directional. The base rate may overestimate stability. However, the ±3 point threshold is relatively wide (±16% of current value), which provides cushion for moderate decay.

**Shift justification:**
- Reduce "Doesn't change" from 85% to 60%: Current downward momentum and above-average positioning make decay more likely than typical random walk
- Increase "Decreases" from 6% to 25%: Strong evidence of decay pattern, current value above baseline
- Increase "Increases" from 9% to 15%: Moderate evidence of potential video release, but high timing uncertainty

## Probability Calibration

**Status quo continuation**: If current trend continues (decay from 100→19 over 8 days), extrapolating suggests value would reach 10-15 by Feb 25, triggering "Decreases."

**Distribution check**:
- 60% "Doesn't change" implies 3:2 odds that value stays 16-22
- 25% "Decreases" implies 1:3 odds that value falls to ≤15
- 15% "Increases" implies 1:5.7 odds that value rises to ≥23

**Calibration considerations**:
1. The ±3 point threshold is relatively forgiving. Value can decay from 19 to 16 (-16%) and still be "Doesn't change."
2. Natural decay of 0.5-1 point per day would result in Feb 25 value of 16-17, staying in "Doesn't change."
3. More aggressive decay of 1-1.5 points per day would result in Feb 25 value of 13-15, triggering "Decreases."
4. Video release during window could spike value, but timing is uncertain and effect magnitude unknown.

**Adjustment**: The 60/25/15 split may underweight "Doesn't change" given the ±3 point buffer. Even with moderate decay, value could stay within 16-22 range. Conversely, the decay momentum is strong and current value is elevated.

**Final calibration**: 
- "Doesn't change": 55% (slightly reduced to account for decay momentum)
- "Decreases": 30% (increased to reflect strong decay pattern and above-average positioning)
- "Increases": 15% (maintained to account for video release uncertainty)

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase**: Will Google Trends value for "leslie wexner" on Feb 25 differ from Feb 19 (currently 19) by more than 3 points? Options: Increases (≥23), Doesn't change (16-22), Decreases (≤15).

2. **Base rate**: Outside view established 85% "Doesn't change", 9% "Increases", 6% "Decreases" from historical 6-day windows. Final prediction shifts to 55/15/30 due to strong decay evidence and above-average current positioning.

3. **Consistency check**: Most likely = "Doesn't change" (55%), followed by "Decreases" (30%); Least likely = "Increases" (15%). This aligns with decay momentum but acknowledges ±3 point buffer provides stability cushion.

4. **Top evidence pieces**:
   - Strong downward trend: 100→19 over 8 days, 7-day average declining 33.9→13.0
   - Current value (19) is 46% above recent average (13), suggesting reversion
   - Base rate: 85% of 6-day windows show ≤3 point change
   - Video release timing uncertain but possible during window
   - Feb 18 deposition is completed event; no new scheduled catalysts

5. **Blind-spot**: Video/transcript release occurs early in window (Feb 20-21) with extensive media coverage, spiking interest to 25-30 range. This would make "Increases" outcome occur and my 15% probability look too conservative.

6. **Status quo**: Natural decay from elevated position (19) toward baseline (13) over 6 days. However, ±3 point threshold means moderate decay (to 16-17) still counts as "Doesn't change." Volatility is moderate; slight nudge toward status quo ("Doesn't change") may be warranted, but decay momentum is strong.

7. **Technicalities**: Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.
