Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Web Articles (All dated Feb 18-19, 2026):**

1. **WOSU Public Media (Feb 18, 2026)**: Regional public radio station covering the deposition. Factual reporting includes: deposition occurred Feb 18, involved 5 Democratic congressmembers, lasted 6 hours, took place at Wexner's mansion. Contains direct quotes from Representatives Garcia, Min, and Lynch expressing skepticism about Wexner's testimony. High credibility for factual events; opinions clearly attributed to named sources.

2. **CNBC (Feb 18, 2026)**: National business news outlet. Provides Wexner's prepared statement and Rep. Garcia's reactions. Factual timeline of Epstein relationship. Professional journalism standards, clearly distinguishes Wexner's claims from Congressional reactions.

3. **WFSB/AP (Feb 19, 2026)**: Associated Press wire story. Comprehensive coverage including document evidence (Epstein's notes, emails). Rep. Comer confirms video/transcript to be released "soon." High credibility due to AP standards.

4. **San Diego Union-Tribune/AP (Feb 18, 2026)**: Same AP story as above, confirming widespread national distribution.

5. **Times of India video (date unclear)**: Brief summary, minimal detail. Lower information value.

6. **Columbus Dispatch photo gallery (Feb 18, 2026)**: Local coverage, primarily visual documentation of press conference. Confirms location change to New Albany, Ohio.

**Agent Report**: Identifies scheduled events for Feb 19-25:
- Key finding: House deposition video/transcript release is "imminent" but no exact date
- Strauss lawsuit deposition ordered within 60 days (by April 12) but not yet scheduled
- No other major scheduled events identified
- Quality: Thorough search, clearly distinguishes confirmed vs. potential events

**Key Factual Consensus Across Sources:**
- Deposition occurred Feb 18, 2026 (yesterday relative to question opening)
- Lasted 6 hours, closed-door
- Video and transcript to be released "soon" (no exact date)
- Major national coverage on Feb 18-19
- Democrats expressed strong skepticism of Wexner's denials

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible reference classes:**

1. **All 6-day windows in the 90-day Google Trends data**: 
   - Most suitable baseline
   - 85% show change ≤3 points ("Doesn't change")
   - 9% increase >3 points
   - 6% decrease >3 points

2. **Post-major-news-event decay patterns**:
   - Current value (Feb 19) = 19, down from peak of 100 on Feb 11
   - Shows rapid decay from major news events
   - Feb 10-11 spike (83→100) likely related to DOJ document release or deposition announcement
   - Decay pattern: 100→38→18→13→13→9→7→12→19
   - The Feb 18 value (12) and Feb 19 value (19) suggest stabilization around 10-20 range

3. **News cycles for political/legal controversies**:
   - Typically spike on initial revelation, decay over days
   - Secondary spikes occur with new revelations or releases

**Selected reference class**: Combination of (1) base rate and (2) post-event decay patterns, given we're in the immediate aftermath of major news.

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: Feb 19 (today) to Feb 25 (6 days)
- Question asks: Will value on Feb 25 differ from Feb 19 by more than 3 points?
- Current value (Feb 19): 19

**Historical patterns over 6-day windows:**
- 85% of time: change ≤3 points
- Recent 7-day average (13.0) vs prior 7-day average (33.9) shows strong downward trend
- However, Feb 19 value (19) represents a slight uptick from Feb 18 (12)

**Current position in news cycle:**
- Day 2 after major deposition (Feb 18)
- Typical pattern: initial spike, rapid decay, potential secondary spike if new material released
- Agent report confirms video/transcript release is "imminent" but unscheduled

## (d) Justification

**Factors favoring "Doesn't change" (85% base rate):**
- Strong statistical base rate: 85% of 6-day windows show ≤3 point change
- Current value (19) is already in a post-spike stabilization phase
- No confirmed scheduled events for Feb 19-25 period
- News cycle typically requires 2-3 days for major stories to fully propagate and decay

**Factors favoring "Decreases":**
- Clear downward trend from peak (100→19 over 8 days)
- Recent 7-day average (13.0) suggests natural resting level below current 19
- Without new catalysts, interest typically continues decaying
- Feb 19 value (19) may represent last gasp of Feb 18 news coverage

**Factors favoring "Increases":**
- Video/transcript release could occur during window (described as "soon")
- If released, would provide new primary source material for media coverage
- Feb 18-19 coverage was extensive and national
- Any institutional action at OSU (though not confirmed for this window)
- However: release timing is uncertain; could be after Feb 25

**Critical uncertainty**: The "imminent" video/transcript release. If it occurs during Feb 19-25, it could spike interest above 22 (requiring >3 point increase from 19). If it doesn't occur, natural decay suggests value will fall toward 10-15 range (requiring decrease below 16).

Outside view calibration:

**Calibration considerations:**

1. **Base rate tethering**: The 85%/9%/6% distribution from historical 6-day windows provides strong anchor, but current context differs from "typical" periods—we're in immediate aftermath of major news.

2. **Asymmetric risks**: 
   - Downside: Natural decay is predictable and gradual
   - Upside: Video release would be discrete event causing potential spike
   - The uncertainty about video release timing creates right-tail risk

3. **Current value positioning**: At 19, we're above recent 7-day average (13) but well below peak (100). A decrease to 16 or below (-3 points) seems more likely than increase to 23+ (+4 points) absent new catalyst.

4. **Historical upset rate**: In this domain (Google Trends for individuals in legal/political controversies), major deviations from base rates typically require discrete news events. The 15% non-stable rate (9% increase + 6% decrease) likely reflects periods with such events.

5. **Probability distribution adjustment**:
   - Base rate suggests 85% "Doesn't change"
   - Given downward trend and current above-average positioning, shift probability from "Doesn't change" toward "Decreases"
   - Given uncertain but possible video release, maintain some probability for "Increases"
   - Adjusted: ~60% Doesn't change, ~30% Decreases, ~10% Increases
