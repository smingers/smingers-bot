Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**PBS News (Feb 18, 2026):** Factual report on Wexner's scheduled deposition, relationship timeline with Epstein, document mentions (1,000+ times in DOJ files). Quotes from Wexner's statements and spokesperson. High reliability - established news source with clear attribution.

**CNBC (Feb 18, 2026):** Reports on completed deposition, Wexner's prepared statement denying wrongdoing, Rep. Garcia's skepticism. Multiple direct quotes from identifiable sources (Garcia, Wexner). High reliability.

**WDBJ7/AP (Feb 19, 2026):** Comprehensive coverage of 6-hour testimony, financial details, reactions from Reps. Comer and Garcia. AP wire service - very high reliability for factual reporting.

**UPI (Feb 12, 2026):** Covers separate OSU/Strauss lawsuit deposition order. Different matter but shows Wexner facing multiple legal proceedings. Moderate reliability for context.

**The Lantern (Jan 29, 2026):** Student newspaper covering motion to quash Strauss subpoena. Provides background but pre-dates main event. Moderate reliability.

**Sportico (Feb 11, 2026):** Legal/sports outlet covering OSU deposition order. Factual court ruling details. High reliability for legal facts.

**AskNews Articles:** Multiple sources (Straits Times, mint, RT Arabic, Forbes, Jerusalem Post, CNN, Raw Story) all confirm Feb 18-19 deposition occurred. Consensus on key facts: 6-hour closed-door testimony, Wexner denied wrongdoing, claimed he was "duped," Rep. Garcia expressed skepticism. High reliability through convergence.

**Key Expert Opinion:** Rep. Robert Garcia (identifiable, top Democrat on committee) stated Wexner was "Jeffrey Epstein's single largest benefactor" and expressed disbelief at Wexner's claims of no personal relationship. This is a credible expert opinion from someone with direct access to evidence.

## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
- Multiple independent sources (PBS, CNBC, AP, AskNews aggregation) confirm deposition occurred Feb 18-19, 2026 - this is the PRIMARY catalyst event
- Current Google Trends value is 19 (as of Feb 19) per question background - elevated but declining from peak of 100 on Feb 11
- Historical pattern: After Feb 11 spike (deposition announcement), value declined from 38→12 over Feb 12-18, showing rapid decay
- Resolution window is Feb 19-25 (6 days starting TODAY, the deposition date)

**Moderate Evidence:**
- Committee may release transcript/video within 3-5 business days (estimated 40% probability by outside view analysis) - this would be a secondary catalyst
- Rep. Garcia's public statements suggest continued media attention, but no specific scheduled events mentioned in sources
- No other major scheduled Wexner-related events identified for Feb 20-25 window

**Weak Evidence:**
- General media interest patterns suggest secondary bumps are typically smaller than initial spikes
- Anecdotal: Some sources mention "developing story" but no concrete future catalysts identified

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window:** 6 days (Feb 19-25, 2026). Resolution compares Feb 25 value to Feb 19 value (currently 19).

**Critical Timing Issue:** The deposition ALREADY OCCURRED on Feb 18-19. The question opened Feb 19, meaning the primary catalyst is essentially in the past relative to the resolution window. The Feb 19 value of 19 likely already reflects initial deposition coverage.

**If timeframe halved (3 days):** Would heavily favor "Doesn't change" - insufficient time for transcript release or sustained media cycle.

**If timeframe doubled (12 days):** Would increase "Decreases" probability significantly - more time for decay from elevated level; also increases chance of transcript release causing temporary "Increase."

## (d) Justification for Shifts from Outside View

**Outside View Base Rates:** Increases 15%, Doesn't change 75%, Decreases 10%

**Key Factors Requiring Adjustment:**

1. **Timing of Primary Catalyst (Strong):** The deposition occurred Feb 18-19, and the question opened Feb 19. The current value of 19 likely already incorporates day-of-deposition search interest. This is fundamentally different from the historical reference class where we're measuring 6-day changes from random starting points. Here, we're starting from the day of maximum news impact.

2. **Decay Pattern (Strong):** Historical data shows rapid decay after spikes: 100→38→12 over 7 days (Feb 11-18). Starting at 19 on the day of the event, natural decay over 6 days would push toward single digits, easily exceeding -3 threshold.

3. **Secondary Catalyst Uncertainty (Moderate):** Transcript release could occur but timing is uncertain (~40% within window per outside view). Even if it occurs, starting from 19 (already elevated), reaching 23+ requires significant renewed interest. Historical pattern shows secondary bumps are smaller.

4. **Mean Reversion (Strong):** Value of 19 is far above 90-day mean of 4.3. Strong gravitational pull toward baseline, especially absent new major catalysts.

**Directional Impact:**
- **Decreases:** Should increase significantly. Starting from day-of-event at 19, decay over 6 days is highly likely. Historical precedent shows 43% of 6-day windows starting above 15 experienced >3-point drops.
- **Doesn't change:** Should decrease. The ±3-point band around 19 (16-22) is narrow relative to typical volatility from this elevated starting point.
- **Increases:** Should decrease slightly. Transcript release is uncertain, and even if it occurs, generating >4-point increase from already-elevated 19 is difficult.

## Probability Calibration

**Status Quo Continuation:** If current decay trend continues (losing ~4 points per day as seen Feb 12-18), value would reach ~1 by Feb 25, clearly triggering "Decreases."

**Calibration Logic:**

Starting from outside view 15/75/10, I adjust:

1. **Decreases (10% → 45%):** Major upward revision. Starting at 19 on the event day with established decay pattern makes significant decline highly probable. The -3 threshold (reaching 15 or below) is very achievable given historical decay rates.

2. **Doesn't change (75% → 40%):** Major downward revision. The 16-22 band is narrow. Natural volatility from this elevated starting point makes staying within ±3 less likely than the base rate suggests.

3. **Increases (15% → 15%):** Maintain. Transcript release remains possible (~40% within window), but generating >4-point increase from 19 requires hitting 23+. This roughly balances out, keeping probability similar to base rate.

**Sanity Check:** 45% + 40% + 15% = 100%. The distribution reflects high uncertainty but correctly weights the strong decay signal against the narrow "no change" band and uncertain upside catalyst.

## Checklist:

1. **Paraphrase:** Predict whether Google Trends value for "leslie wexner" on Feb 25 will be >3 higher, ±3, or >3 lower than Feb 19 value (currently 19).

2. **Base rate:** Started with 15/75/10 for Increases/Doesn't change/Decreases from historical 90-day windows.

3. **Consistency:** Most likely = Decreases (45%); Least likely = Increases (15%). Makes sense given decay pattern from elevated starting point on event day.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - Deposition occurred Feb 18-19; Feb 19 value of 19 already reflects this
   - Historical decay: 100→38→12 over prior 7 days shows rapid decline
   - Starting at 19, decay to ≤15 (triggering "Decreases") is highly probable
   - Transcript release timing uncertain; even if occurs, limited upside from 19
   - Mean reversion strong: 19 >> 90-day mean of 4.3

5. **Blind spot:** Unexpected major news development (e.g., criminal referral, bombshell revelation from transcript, major media investigation) could spike interest above 22. Would shift probability toward "Increases" to ~35%, reducing "Decreases" to ~30%.

6. **Status quo:** Current trend is decay. Slight nudge toward status quo (Decreases) is already incorporated in my 45% assignment.

7. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, range 0-100, no % signs.
