Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**Primary News Sources (February 18-19, 2026):**

1. **WOSU Public Media (Feb 18, 2026)**: Local NPR affiliate providing detailed coverage of the House deposition. High credibility for factual reporting. Contains direct quotes from Rep. Garcia, Min, and Lynch expressing skepticism of Wexner's testimony. Factual elements: deposition occurred Feb 18, lasted 6 hours, Democrats expressed disbelief. Opinion elements: Democrats' assessments of Wexner's credibility.

2. **CNBC (Feb 18, 2026)**: National business news outlet. High credibility. Provides Wexner's prepared statement and Rep. Garcia's reactions. Factual: deposition details, Wexner's claims. Opinion: Garcia's characterization of Wexner as "Epstein's single largest benefactor."

3. **WFSB/AP (Feb 19, 2026)**: Associated Press wire story, gold standard for factual reporting. Reports 6-hour testimony, mentions upcoming video/transcript release. Factual throughout with minimal opinion beyond quoted sources.

4. **San Diego Union-Tribune/AP (Feb 18, 2026)**: Same AP story as above, slightly different timestamp. Same high credibility.

5. **Times of India video (date unclear)**: Brief video summary, lower detail. Confirms island visit admission but provides minimal new information.

6. **Columbus Dispatch photo gallery (Feb 18, 2026)**: Local coverage focused on press conference logistics. Limited substantive content.

**Agent Report:**
Comprehensive search for scheduled events Feb 19-25. Key finding: House deposition transcript/video release is "imminent" but no exact date specified. Also identifies potential Strauss litigation deposition (within 60 days of Feb 12 = by April 12) and possible OSU institutional actions. High relevance for forecasting catalysts.

**Google Trends Data:**
Objective quantitative data showing massive spike on Feb 10-11 (values 83-100), followed by decay. Current value on Feb 19 is 19, down from peak but elevated above baseline (90-day mean: 4.3).

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Possible Reference Classes:**

1. **All 6-day windows in the 90-day Google Trends history**: Base rate shows 85% "no change" (≤3 points), 9% increase (>3), 6% decrease (>3). However, this includes periods with no news activity.

2. **Post-major-news decay patterns**: When Wexner hits the news cycle (Feb 10-11 spike to 100), interest typically decays over subsequent days. The pattern shows: Feb 11 (100) → Feb 12 (38) → Feb 13 (18) → Feb 14 (13) → stabilizing around 9-13 for several days → Feb 19 (19).

3. **Congressional testimony aftermath patterns**: Similar high-profile depositions typically generate initial spike, then secondary spike when transcripts/videos are released days later.

**Most Suitable Reference Class**: Post-major-news decay with potential for secondary spike upon transcript release. This is most relevant because:
- We're in the immediate aftermath of a major news event (Feb 18 deposition)
- The Feb 19 value (19) represents a slight uptick from Feb 17-18 (7-12), likely from continued coverage
- Transcript release is "imminent" within the Feb 19-25 window

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction Window**: February 19-25, 2026 (6 days)
**Starting Value**: 19 (on Feb 19)
**Resolution Mechanism**: Compare Feb 25 value to Feb 19 value using fixed-date URL

**Historical Patterns Over Similar Periods:**

Looking at the decay pattern after the Feb 10-11 spike:
- Feb 11 (100) to Feb 17 (7): 7-day decline of 93 points
- Feb 12 (38) to Feb 18 (12): 6-day decline of 26 points
- Feb 13 (18) to Feb 19 (19): 6-day change of +1 point (essentially stable)

The current value (19) is approximately where the Feb 10-11 news cycle stabilized (13-18 range on Feb 13-15) before declining further. However, Feb 18-19 shows renewed interest (12→19), likely from continued media coverage of the deposition.

**Critical Catalysts in Window:**
1. **Transcript/video release**: Most likely to cause significant increase if released
2. **Secondary media coverage**: Op-eds, analysis pieces typically follow 1-3 days after major testimony
3. **Natural decay**: Without new catalysts, values tend to decline toward baseline

## (d) Justification

The Feb 19 starting value of 19 reflects elevated but declining interest from the Feb 18 deposition. Three scenarios dominate:

**Scenario 1 (Increase >3 points)**: Transcript/video release occurs during Feb 19-25. The Agent report confirms this is "imminent" and "within several business days." If released, historical patterns suggest a secondary spike (though typically smaller than initial spike). Given the contentious nature of the testimony and Democrats' public skepticism, media would amplify any new revelations. Probability: Moderate-High.

**Scenario 2 (Stable ±3 points)**: Continued moderate coverage without major new catalyst. The story remains in news cycle with analysis pieces, but no transcript release. Value oscillates around 15-22 range. Probability: Moderate.

**Scenario 3 (Decrease >3 points)**: Natural decay continues without new catalysts. Value drops below 16 by Feb 25. This matches the Feb 12-17 decay pattern, but seems less likely given the Feb 18-19 uptick suggesting renewed interest. Probability: Low-Moderate.

The key uncertainty is transcript release timing. Congressional practice suggests release within "several business days" - Feb 19 is Wednesday, making Feb 20-24 (Thu-Mon) the most likely window. The contentious nature of testimony (Democrats publicly calling Wexner's claims "bogus" and "not credible") increases likelihood of media amplification upon release.

## Outside View Calibration

**Tethering to Established Distributions:**
- Base rate (all 6-day windows): 85% no change, 9% increase, 6% decrease
- However, we're not in a "typical" period - we're in immediate aftermath of major news

**Adjustments for Current Context:**
1. **Elevated starting point** (19 vs. baseline 4.3): Suggests story has momentum
2. **Imminent catalyst** (transcript release): Shifts probability toward increase
3. **Recent uptick** (7→12→19 over Feb 17-19): Indicates sustained interest, not just decay
4. **Democratic skepticism**: Creates narrative tension that media will cover

**Historical Upset Rate:**
In the 90-day period, major spikes are rare but do occur (Feb 10-11). Secondary spikes after initial news are common but smaller. The question is whether Feb 25 will be higher, similar, or lower than Feb 19's value of 19.

**Probability Reasoning:**
- **Increase (>22)**: 50% - Transcript release is likely in this window and would drive renewed coverage
- **Stable (16-22)**: 35% - Continued coverage without major catalyst, or transcript released late in window with limited immediate impact
- **Decrease (<16)**: 15% - Natural decay dominates, transcript not released until after Feb 25

These probabilities reflect:
1. High likelihood of transcript release as primary catalyst
2. Sustained media interest from contentious testimony
3. Lower probability of complete decay given recent uptick
4. Uncertainty about exact timing of transcript release

Doesn't change: 35
