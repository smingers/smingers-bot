Analysis:

### 1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Compare Google Trends (US, fixed range 2026-01-26 to 2026-02-25) values for “leslie wexner” on **2026-02-19 vs 2026-02-25**: **Increase** if +>3, **Decrease** if ->3, otherwise **Doesn’t change**.

### (a) Source analysis (what each source says; quality/date; facts vs opinions)

**PBS / AP (Feb 18, 2026)**  
- **Facts:** Wexner scheduled for/under congressional deposition; name appears 1,000+ times in DOJ Epstein files; timeline details incl. post-2007 contact.  
- **Opinions/claims:** Spokesperson characterization of Epstein draft letter; narrative framing.  
- **Quality:** High (AP via PBS). Timely.

**CNBC (Feb 18, 2026)**  
- **Facts:** Deposition occurred; quotes from Wexner prepared statement; committee reactions.  
- **Opinions:** Rep. Garcia calling Wexner claims “bogus” etc. (important but political opinion).  
- **Quality:** High; timely.

**WDBJ7 / AP (Feb 19, 2026)**  
- **Facts:** ~6-hour testimony; subpoena context; $100m repayment memo; 1,000+ mentions; denial of wrongdoing.  
- **Opinions:** lawmakers’ quoted skepticism.  
- **Quality:** High (AP). Timely and directly tied to why searches might spike.

**UPI (Feb 12, unclear year but context fits 2026-ish)**  
- **Facts:** Federal court ordered Wexner deposition in OSU/Dr. Strauss litigation within 60 days; motion to quash denied.  
- **Quality:** Medium-high; relevant but less directly tied to the Feb 19–25 spike unless a new development occurs inside window.

**The Lantern (Jan 29, 2026)**  
- **Facts:** Motion to quash; service attempts; OSU naming controversy; earlier subpoena mention.  
- **Quality:** Medium (student/local outlet). Useful context; not a strong near-term catalyst by itself.

**Sportico (Feb 11, 2026)**  
- **Facts:** Court compels deposition; within 60 days; details on trusteeship; mentions unredacted FBI doc labeling.  
- **Quality:** Medium-high; good legal/process detail; timing suggests Strauss deposition likely *outside* this 6-day window.

**AskNews articles (various)**
- **Straits Times (Feb 19, 2026):** Essentially repeats major-wire facts; high-ish reliability but secondary.  
- **Rumble (Feb 19, 2026):** Commentary/conspiracy framing; **low reliability**; weak for forecasting mainstream search volume.  
- **Mint (Feb 19, 2026):** Re-reporting; medium reliability.  
- **RT Arabic / Almasry Alyoum (Feb 18–19, 2026):** Re-reporting with editorial spin; medium-low; may contribute to global interest but question is **US Google Trends**, so effect is indirect.  
- **Investing.com (Feb 18, 2026):** Syndicated Bloomberg-like snippet; medium reliability.  
- **Ouest France (Feb 18, 2026):** Re-reporting; medium.  
- **CNN International (Feb 18, 2026):** High reliability; narrative about FBI interest + file release; likely to drive US searches around publication.  
- **Forbes (Feb 18, 2026):** High reliability; developing story; likely to drive US searches around publication.  
- **GuruFocus (Feb 10, 2026):** Finance-angle commentary; low-to-medium relevance to broad searches.

**Key implication for Trends:** These sources strongly support that **Feb 18–19 is a news peak/mini-peak** for the term in the US, which often implies **post-peak decay** unless there is a second trigger (e.g., transcript release, new allegation, DOJ action).

### (b) Evidence analysis (weighted to resolution: Feb 25 value vs Feb 19 value)

**Strong evidence**
1. **Multiple independent high-credibility outlets (AP/PBS, CNBC, CNN, Forbes) published Feb 18–19** about Wexner deposition/Epstein files.  
   - Mechanism: major news coverage → search spike around those dates.  
   - Forecasting effect: increases likelihood that **Feb 19 is relatively elevated**, making a **subsequent decrease** more likely absent new news.

2. **Event-timing structure:** deposition just occurred; the “status quo” after a major-news day is typically **attention decay** over the following week.  
   - Mechanism: news-cycle half-life.

**Moderate evidence**
1. **Possibility of transcript/video release or follow-on revelations during Feb 19–25** (mentioned as possible/imminent in context, but no firm date in the provided sources).  
   - Mechanism: second wave of coverage → could push Feb 25 above Feb 19 by >3.  
   - However uncertainty is high; closed-door transcripts are often delayed or not promptly released.

2. **Second storyline (OSU/Strauss litigation; naming controversy)** exists, but key legally compelled deposition is “within 60 days,” which likely falls **after** Feb 25.  
   - Mechanism exists, timing mismatch reduces weight for this window.

**Weak evidence**
1. **Rumble/conspiracy commentary**: could create some incremental searches, but likely marginal for US Google Trends relative to mainstream coverage.  
2. **International-language reprints**: may not materially affect US search behavior.

### (c) Timeframe analysis
- Window: **6 days** (from Feb 19 to Feb 25). Very short; dominated by news-cycle decay vs any one-off follow-up headline.
- If timeframe were **halved (~3 days)**: I’d push probability toward **“Doesn’t change”** (less time for decay or for a second event to land).
- If timeframe were **doubled (~12 days)**: I’d push probability toward **“Decreases”** (more time for attention to mean-revert toward baseline).

---

### (d) Justification: updating the outside view
**Outside view base rate (given):** Increases 50 / Doesn’t change 35 / Decreases 15.

**Why I’m shifting toward “Doesn’t change” and “Decreases” vs that baseline:**
- The outside view seems to assume a fairly high probability of a **second spike** (e.g., transcript release) lifting Feb 25 above Feb 19. The provided sources, though, **do not confirm** a scheduled transcript release within the window—only that deposition happened and *may* yield follow-on media.
- With multiple top-tier publications concentrated on **Feb 18–19**, Feb 19 is plausibly a **local maximum** or at least elevated. In many similar “person in scandal news” Trend patterns, the next week is drift-down, often exceeding a 3-point move.
- Still, because the threshold for “Doesn’t change” is fairly wide (±3) and because ongoing drip coverage could keep interest sticky, I keep “Doesn’t change” as the single most likely bucket.

Net: reduce “Increases” substantially; raise “Decreases” substantially; modestly raise “Doesn’t change.”

Probability calibration:

- **Status quo continuation:** post-deposition coverage fades → **slightly lower** by Feb 25 than Feb 19 → favors **Decreases**, with some chance it’s within 3 (Doesn’t change).
- **What yields “Increase”:** a new high-salience development (transcript release with notable excerpts; new subpoena; bombshell document; viral clip). Plausible but not evidenced strongly enough to dominate.
- **Sensitivity (+/-10%):** If I learned a transcript release date of Feb 24, I’d shift ~+15 to “Increases” mainly from “Decreases/Doesn’t change.” Without that, I keep “Increases” below one-third.

**Inside view distribution (final):**
- Increases: 28  
- Doesn’t change: 42  
- Decreases: 30  

Checklist:
1) Criteria check: Feb 25 value vs Feb 19; ±3 = Doesn’t change; >+3 Increase; <-3 Decrease; fixed URL.  
2) Outside view base rate: [50, 35, 15]. Final remains anchored but adjusted for likely post-peak decay + uncertainty of second spike.  
3) Consistency: Most likely = Doesn’t change; Least likely = Increases; yes (short window, wide ±3 band, but decay risk).  
4) Key evidence (<=20 words each):
   - Heavy mainstream coverage concentrated Feb 18–19 implies Feb 19 elevated; decay likely by Feb 25.  
   - No confirmed transcript-release date in sources; second spike uncertain.  
   - Closed-door deposition stories usually fade within a week unless new documents drop.  
   - ±3 threshold makes “Doesn’t change” structurally common.  
5) Blind spot: Transcript/video released with a viral excerpt on Feb 24–25 → sharp Increase; would raise “Increases” materially.  
6) Status quo: attention usually mean-reverts; nudges probability toward “Doesn’t change/Decreases.”  
7) Technicalities: probabilities 0–100, sum to 100, no % signs.

Probabilities: [28, 42, 30]
