Analysis
(a) Source analysis  
1. PBS/AP, CNBC, WDBJ7/AP, CNN, Forbes, Bloomberg (all 18-19 Feb 2026).  Reputable mainstream outlets, datelined within the last 48 h, all fact-report the same event: Les Wexner’s 6-hour House Oversight deposition in Ohio and the surrounding release of DOJ “Epstein files”.  Opinions are attributed to lawmakers; the hard facts (deposition occurred, no further hearings scheduled this week) are high-quality.  
2. Raw Story, Straits Times, Rumble clips, Arabic/French press re-cycle the same deposition story; reliability moderate, useful only to confirm wide international pickup (breadth of coverage).  
3. Sportico, UPI, Lantern pieces (11 Feb–12 Feb 2026) cover a separate OSU-Strauss subpoena; solid but older, indicating no new hearing is set in the coming week.  
4. Google Trends 30-day chart (link in question) – primary quantitative source; shows a Feb 10-11 spike to 100 then decay to 10 by 16 Feb.  High relevance, mechanically ties to resolution criteria.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• Historical Google-Trends data supplied by question setter: in the last 90 days only 15 % of six-day windows moved > 3 points.  
Moderate evidence  
• News burst (18-19 Feb) already produced a partial rebound in coverage; no additional scheduled events through 25 Feb (per congressional calendar, OSU court order deadline “within 60 days” not imminent).  
• Typical post-scandal search trajectories show fast exponential decay after the principal news day (literature on “attention half-life”).  
Weak evidence  
• Speculation that a transcript video could surface in the next few days – possible but unscheduled.  
• Social-media chatter may create an echo spike (anecdotal).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in 6 days (19 → 25 Feb 2026).  If the window were halved to three days I would shift 5 pts from Decrease to No-change (less time for decay).  If doubled to 12 days I would shift 10 pts from No-change to Decrease (longer decay window).

(d) Justification / Inside-view shift  
Base rate (last 90 days): 12 / 70 / 18 (Inc / NC / Dec).  
Adjustments:  
1. The term just experienced a large spike (100) and still stands above normal (≈10 vs typical 2–4).  Attention decay over six days is almost always downward; odds of a > 3-point drop therefore rise materially. (+22 pts to Decrease)  
2. Fresh deposition coverage probably lifts 19 Feb value into the low-teens (not supplied yet).  Any further media hit must add > 3 points by 25 Feb to register an “Increase”.  With no scheduled catalyst, probability modest but non-negligible. (+3 pts to Increase).  
3. Because ±3 is a tight band, even modest decay will cross the threshold, trimming the “Doesn’t change” share. (–25 pts from No-change).  
Net inside-view estimate below.

Forecasting checklist  
1. Options: Compare Google-Trends US daily values for “leslie wexner” on 19 Feb vs 25 Feb 2026; > +3 = Increase, within ±3 = No change, < –3 = Decrease.  
2. Outside view: 12 / 70 / 18.  
3. Consistency: Most-likely = Decrease; Least-likely = Increase – consistent with arguments.  
4. Key evidence (20 words each)  
   • 100-point spike 10-11 Feb already collapsing to 10 by 16 Feb.  
   • Major deposition coverage occurs 18-19 Feb, none scheduled afterwards.  
   • 85 % of past six-day windows stayed within ±3, but those windows rarely started just after a spike.  
   • Scholarly “news half-life” research: rapid exponential search-interest decay (t½ ≈ 1-2 days).  
5. Blind-spot: A sensational leak (e.g., video of testimony) on 23-24 Feb could trigger a second-wave spike > +3, flipping outcome to Increase.  
6. Status-quo bias: Tight ±3 band still captures 35 % chance of drifting little, so I keep sizeable No-change probability.  
7. Technical: Probabilities sum to 100 and are 0-100 integers.

Probabilities: [15, 35, 50]
