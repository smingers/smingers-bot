Analysis:

A. Source analysis  
1. WOSU (18 Feb 2026, local NPR affiliate).  Factual: details of Wexner’s 18 Feb closed-door congressional deposition; quotes from participating House members; no speculative claims.  High reliability.  
2. CNBC (18 Feb 2026, national business outlet).  Repeats factual deposition information, provides prepared-statement quotes; opinionated remarks clearly attributed to Rep. Garcia.  High reliability.  
3. WFSB / Associated Press (19 Feb 2026).  National wire story; facts about length of testimony, subpoena, major excerpts from Wexner’s answers.  Very high reliability.  
4. San Diego Union-Tribune / AP (18 Feb 2026).  Same AP feed; factual, high quality.  
5. Times of India video blurb (undated but after 18 Feb 2026).  Short secondary clip; little original reporting.  Moderate reliability, low weight.  
6. Columbus Dispatch photo gallery (18 Feb 2026).  Local photo captions; confirms that a press conference occurred.  Moderate reliability for bare facts.  
7. Agent report (19 Feb 2026).  Synthesises docket searches and media monitoring; notes that the only scheduled catalyst inside 19–25 Feb is the likely public release of the deposition transcript/video, with other possibilities uncertain.  No opinions; moderate reliability (transparency of methods).  
8. Google Trends data file (through 19 Feb 2026).  Machine-generated, objective; gives daily U.S. “interest over time” values.  Very high reliability for relative figures.

B. Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
i. All 6-day changes in Google Trends for “leslie wexner” over the past 90 days.  
ii. All 6-day changes for comparably sized February 2024 congressional-hearing spikes (e.g., “Sam Bankman-Fried”, “Elon Musk testimony”).  
iii. Generic 6-day variability for proper-name searches averaging below 5 except during news bursts.

Class (i) is specific, plentiful (≈84 overlapping windows) and already summarised: 85 % “Doesn’t change”, 9 % “Increases”, 6 % “Decreases”.  It directly matches the metric, geography and scale.  I adopt (i).

C. Timeframe analysis  
Resolution window = 6 calendar days (19 Feb → 25 Feb 2026).  Historically, 15 % of such spans for the term moved > 3 points.  The current reading (19) sits well above the 90-day mean (4.3) and far below the recent peak (100 on 11 Feb).  After spikes, Google-Trends curves for news figures usually decay roughly log-linearly; in the week 12–18 Feb the value fell from 38 → 12, consistent with that decay.

D. Justification for outside view  
1. Base rate: 85 % chance of ≤3-point movement.  
2. Mean-reversion tendency: when the starting point is in the upper quartile of its 90-day range (here the 75th percentile is ~4; today’s 19 >> that), subsequent 6-day change skews toward decline or flat, not renewed increase.  
3. Catalysts during the window are unclear.  The only “scheduled” item is the committee’s promised release of the deposition transcript/video; committee practice sometimes posts within 3–5 working days.  Such a release would probably lift searches, but prior related releases (e.g., 10 Feb DOJ file dump) generated a one-day spike of 83→100, then faded fast.  The probability that the release actually lands between 19 and 25 Feb is uncertain (I estimate ~40 %).  Even if it does, a ≥4-point jump from an already-elevated 19 requires hitting 23+.  That happened in just 14 % of the past 90 days, concentrated on the deposition-driven 10–13 Feb burst.  
4. Downside risk: simple decay could take the value from 19 to the low teens or single digits, exceeding the −3 threshold.  Of the 14 days since the 11 Feb peak, 6 days (43 %) experienced a drop of more than 3 points over a six-day span when starting above 15.  
5. Expert / market analogue: No betting markets exist; media attention patterns for congressional testimonies usually show one secondary bump (when videos are released) roughly half the size of the initial spike.  That would imply a move from 19 to the mid-30s if it occurs—enough for an “Increase”.

Balancing:  
• Base rate strongly favours “Doesn’t change”.  
• Elevated starting point plus decay introduces a heavier tail on “Decreases” than on “Increases”.  
• Unsure timing of transcript publication gives “Increases” a non-trivial, but still smaller, chance.

Outside view calibration:

Anchor to base-rate 85/9/6.  Adjust 6 → 10 for “Decreases” to reflect mean-reversion.  Reduce “Doesn’t change” to 75.  Leave “Increases” at 15 (base 9 plus +6 for possible transcript drop).  Check sum = 100.  Historical upset rate (unexpected >4-point moves) was 15 %; my combined tails 25 % are slightly higher, guarding against over-confidence.

Outside View Prediction:
Increases: 15%  
Doesn't change: 75%  
Decreases: 10%
