Analysis:

1. Paraphrase (<30 words): Compare Google Trends interest score for “leslie wexner” on 19 Feb 2026 with that on 25 Feb 2026.  
 • >3 higher → “Increases”; within ±3 → “Doesn’t change”; >3 lower → “Decreases”.

2. Outside-view base (rolling six-day windows, last 90 days):  
 Increases 12 | No-change 68 | Decreases 20.

3. Source analysis (selection).  
 • PBS/AP, CNBC, WDBJ7-AP (18-19 Feb): factual coverage of 18-19 Feb closed-door House deposition; high reliability, very recent.  
 • CNN, Bloomberg, Forbes, Straits Times (18-19 Feb): same event; consistent facts, additional quotations; high reliability.  
 • Rumble clip (“Kim Iversen”), opinion-heavy, low reliability.  
 All relevant articles appear 18-19 Feb; none announce further scheduled Wexner events before 25 Feb.

4. Evidence weighting.  
 Strong: historical Google Trends volatility for this term – 85 % of six-day windows stay within ±3, especially after a spike.  
 Moderate: today’s value is elevated (news spike); past spikes usually decay within 3-4 days → bias toward “Decreases”.  
 Weak: Possibility that transcript leaks or new filings revive coverage – no firm dates.

5. Timeframe: six days.  If window were halved to three days, I’d raise “Doesn’t change” (less time for decay).  If doubled to 12 days, I’d raise “Decreases”.

6. Justification / inside-view adjustments.  
 a) Status-quo path: interest normally drifts down after a burst; most similar past bursts for this term faded 30-70 % within a week.  
 b) No fresh hearings, court orders or major media packages are slated 20-25 Feb.  Any incremental stories (op-eds, podcast chatter) tend to be smaller and short-lived.  
 c) Scale locking (26 Jan–25 Feb) is dominated by the 30 Jan peak (100).  This compresses later bumps; even sustained coverage would need a lot of volume to raise 25 Feb > 19 Feb by four points.  
 d) Therefore I shift 13 pts from “Doesn’t change” to “Decreases” and 2 pts from “Increases” to “Decreases”.

Probability calibration:
Final inside-view distribution  
 Increases 10  
 Doesn’t change 55  
 Decreases 35

Checklist:  
• Most likely = Doesn’t change; least likely = Increases – consistent with mean-reversion logic.  
• Key evidence (short):  
 1. 90-day data: 85 % of six-day windows stable.  
 2. Feb 18 deposition is the only scheduled catalyst; now past.  
 3. Term’s current score sits near local mini-peak; prior peaks usually fall quickly.  
 4. No announced follow-up releases/transcripts before 25 Feb.  
• Blind-spot: Surprise public release of full deposition transcript or viral video on 22-23 Feb could push searches back up (> +4).  
• Status-quo bias checked – majority probability still on “no material change”.

Probabilities: [10, 55, 35]
