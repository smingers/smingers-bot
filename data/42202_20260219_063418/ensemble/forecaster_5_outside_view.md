Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. WOSU (18 Feb 2026) – Ohio NPR affiliate, straight‐news story describing Wexner’s 18 Feb closed-door deposition.  Factual material: who attended, what was said, next investigative steps.  Opinions are clearly labelled quotations from members of Congress.  High reliability, very recent.  
2. CNBC (18 Feb 2026) – National business outlet.  Same event, adds prepared-statement excerpts.  High reliability; distinguishes fact from lawmakers’ opinions.  
3. WFSB / AP (19 Feb 2026) – National wire copy, near-identical factual content, minor additional quotes.  High reliability.  
4. San Diego Union-Tribune / AP (18 Feb 2026) – Duplicate AP feed; same quality.  
5. Columbus Dispatch photo gallery (18 Feb 2026) – Local paper; mostly event photographs with caption facts (time, place).  Reliability moderate (minimal detail, no analysis).  
6. Times of India video blurb (undated but 18–19 Feb context) – Short clip summarising deposition highlight.  Lower depth; facts appear consistent with U.S. reporting; reliability moderate.  
7. Agent report (19 Feb 2026) – Synthetic scan for scheduled events 19–25 Feb.  Provides probabilities that further deposition materials may be released but notes no fixed dates.  Quality: helpful but speculative; use cautiously.  
8. Google Trends data pull (19 Feb 2026) – Direct numerical data from Google.  Objective, highest reliability for past values.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
• Generic 6-day changes for all Google Trends terms – too broad; different base-volatility levels.  
• 6-day changes for “leslie wexner” during quiet periods (pre-Feb-2026) – too narrow; small sample.  
• 6-day changes for “leslie wexner” in last 90 days (contains both quiet weeks and large spike) – captures current scale-locking and term-specific volatility; best match.  
Chosen reference class: all rolling 6-day windows for “leslie wexner” in the last 90 days (n≈84).

Base frequencies from that class:  
• > 3-point increase 9 %  
• change within ±3 85 %  
• > 3-point decrease 6 %

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution window: 6 days (19 → 25 Feb 2026).  That is exactly the window used for the reference class; no seasonal effects expected in February.  The current Google value (19) sits at ≈95th percentile of the previous 90 days (mean 4.3, stdev 14.2).  In the 90-day record, windows that start in the top quartile show reversion slightly more often than increase, nudging probabilities modestly toward “Decreases”.

(d) Justification  
• The outside view purposefully ignores forward-looking news catalysts and focuses on historical statistical regularities.  
• The 90-day reference class indicates that “no material change” is the strong default (≈5 out of 6 cases).  
• The present starting value (19) is elevated relative to baseline because the 10–12 Feb media spike has been decaying; historically, when the first-day value is high, follow-up values more often decline than rise.  That shifts a bit of mass from “Increases” to “Decreases” while still leaving “Doesn’t change” dominant.  
• Data noise (±1-point revisions) makes small movements common; the ±3-point band already cushions that, so the base 85 % figure is realistic.  
• Upset rate: only 15 % of windows deviate from “Doesn’t change”; we expect any single 6-day window to behave similarly absent strong catalysts (outside view deliberately not assuming any).

Outside view calibration:
Start with base 9 / 85 / 6.  
Adjust 2 % from “Increases” to “Decreases” to reflect mean-reversion tendency when the first-day value lies in the top quartile.  
Add an extra 5 % split evenly between “Increases” and “Decreases” (2.5 % each, rounded) to acknowledge that a sample of 84 windows is small and real-world variance may be larger than observed.

Final calibrated outside-view odds:  
Increases ≈ 12 %  
Doesn’t change ≈ 68 %  
Decreases ≈ 20 %

Outside View Prediction:
Option_A (Increases): 12%  
Option_B (Doesn't change): 68%  
Option_C (Decreases): 20%
