You are currently analyzing a forecasting question to generate an outside view prediction.

The forecasting question is:
Will the interest in “leslie wexner” change between 2026-02-19 and 2026-02-25 according to Google Trends?

Question background:
Google Trends is a free tool from Google that shows how often particular search terms are entered into Google relative to the total search volume across different regions and time periods. One of its main features is the “interest over time” graph, which is scaled from 0 to 100. In this graph, 100 represents the peak popularity of the term during the selected time range and location, meaning the point in time when searches for that term were at their highest. A 0 does not mean no searches occurred, but rather that the search interest was too low to register compared to the peak values. Because the values are relative, the numbers for a given day can shift as new data is added or as the overall scale is recalibrated—for example, a value of 40 on one day could later appear as 35 if the relative scaling changes. This effect can be reduced by specifying fixed start and end dates in the URL, which locks the scale for that chosen period and keeps the values consistent.

The current value of the topic “leslie wexner” at the time of writing this question (Feb 16, 2026) compared to the last 30 days is 10; seen at [this url](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&tz=0&q=leslie%20wexner&date=2026-01-17%202026-02-16).

# Summary of Article: "Les Wexner says 'diabolical' Jeffrey Epstein 'duped' him, denies wrongdoing"

**Source:** CNBC  
**Date:** February 18, 2026  
**Author:** Kevin Breuninger

## Key Facts and Events:

1. **Congressional Deposition:** Billionaire Leslie Wexner, 88, gave a congressional deposition on Wednesday (February 18, 2026) to the House Oversight Committee at his home in New Albany, Ohio.

2. **Timing Context:** The deposition occurred weeks after the DOJ released millions of additional files revealing new links between Epstein and major figures in business and politics.

3. **Wexner's Background:** Wexner is the retired founder of Victoria's Secret former parent company L Brands. He had given Epstein power of attorney over his finances decades earlier, and Wexner had long been Epstein's only publicly known client.

4. **Subpoena:** The Oversight Committee subpoenaed Wexner and other Epstein associates in January with bipartisan support.

## Wexner's Claims (from prepared statement and deposition):

- Claims he had virtually no social relationship with Epstein
- States he was "naïve, foolish, and gullible" and was "conned" by Epstein
- Insists he "never saw or heard about Epstein being in the company of a minor girl"
- Claims he "completely and irrevocably cut ties with Epstein nearly twenty years ago"
- Denies witnessing or having knowledge of Epstein's criminal activity
- States he never traveled on Epstein's airplane
- Disputes giving Epstein a New York townhouse, claiming Epstein "purchased it from me for what I was told was the appraised value"
- Admits visiting Epstein's private island once with his wife and young children for "a few hours one morning while we were on a cruise"
- Says he revoked Epstein's power of attorney in September 2007, months before Epstein's 2008 guilty plea

## Named Source Opinions:

**Rep. Robert Garcia, D-Calif. (top-ranking Democrat on House Oversight Committee):**
- Called Wexner's claim about having no personal relationship with Epstein "bogus"
- Stated: "I do not believe when Mr. Wexner says that he did not have a personal relationship or a friendly relationship" with Epstein
- Described Wexner as "Jeffrey Epstein's single largest benefactor"
- Said "much of" Epstein's wealth (plane, island, homes) "came directly from Wexner"
- Stated "We're not exactly sure why. It's not clear."
- Noted: "When you talk to survivors, they'll all share with you that Wexner was at the center of what Epstein was doing"
- Criticized the DOJ/FBI, saying "What the hell is going on? That is shameful" after hearing Wexner has not been contacted by the FBI on Epstein-related matters

## Additional Context:

- Wexner has not been charged with any crime
- Epstein was arrested on federal sex trafficking charges in July 2019 and died by suicide in jail a month later
- The article notes that recent document releases raise "new questions about the extent of that relationship and how long it lasted"

</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Identify any scheduled media releases, court hearings, or major announcements involving Leslie Wexner in the United States between February 19 and 25 2026; include documentary premieres, legal filings, earnings calls, or philanthropic events likely to attract national coverage.
The search produced abundant contemporaneous news coverage of Les Wexner’s 18 February 2026 closed-door deposition before the House Oversight & Reform Committee and of related controversies, but it yielded only a handful of items that qualify as “scheduled” events falling inside the target window of 19 – 25 February 2026.

1. Congressional deposition – release of video and transcript (likely during 19 – 25 Feb).
   • Ranking member Rep. James Comer told reporters that a video recording and full transcript of the 6-hour deposition “are to be released soon” (KWQC/AP, 19 Feb 2026; Marietta Times/AP, 18 Feb 2026).  No exact publication date has been announced, but Committee practice is to post such materials within several business days.  If released between 19 and 25 February, the publication itself will be a fresh piece of primary material and will generate another wave of national coverage focused on Wexner.

2. Federal court–ordered deposition in the Richard Strauss-Ohio State survivor lawsuit (deadline falls in the window but the session date is not yet on the docket).
   • On 12 February 2026 U.S. District Judge Michael Watson ordered Wexner to sit for a civil deposition “within 60 days” (NBC News, 12 Feb 2026).  Attorneys have not yet calendared the precise date publicly.  Therefore, a Strauss-case deposition could, but will not necessarily, occur between 19 and 25 February.  If noticed for that period, it would attract regional and likely national press, given the Epstein context.

3. Potential supplemental House Oversight interviews with Wexner-linked figures.
   • Committee Democrats said on 18 February that they will next turn to other individuals who received money from Wexner or Epstein, naming OSU OB-GYN Dr. Mark Landon (WOSU, 18 Feb 2026).  No dates have been published, but any public notice of additional subpoenas or depositions could land in the target week and reignite Google searches on Wexner’s name.

4. Institutional actions concerning Wexner’s philanthropy and naming rights.
   • Ohio State University confirmed multiple pending requests to remove Wexner’s name from campus entities and provided a portal for formal petitions (Columbus Dispatch, 17 Feb 2026).  The school has not published meeting dates for its Board of Trustees or Naming Committee during 19 – 25 Feb, but should either body place the issue on an agenda, coverage would be statewide and possibly national, especially if a vote is imminent.

5. No evidence of documentary premieres, television specials, or podcast series tied specifically to the 19–25 Feb window.
   • The major Epstein-related documentary projects now streaming (e.g., Hulu’s “Victoria’s Secret: Angels and Demons,” Netflix’s “Jeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich”) debuted years earlier, and no sources mention a forthcoming episode or film launch during the week in question.

6. No scheduled corporate events.
   • Wexner resigned from L Brands (since split into Bath & Body Works Inc. and the private Victoria’s Secret & Co.) in 2020.  Neither successor company lists Wexner on its boards, and their earnings calls fall outside the 19 – 25 Feb interval; consequently, Wexner is not expected to appear on any publicly traded company’s earnings call that week.

7. No philanthropic galas or public-facing Wexner Foundation events announced for 19 – 25 Feb.
   • Public calendars for the Wexner Foundation and OSU Wexner Medical Center show routine academic “MedTips” releases (OSU Wexner Medical Center, 13 Feb 2026) but nothing bearing directly on Les Wexner that is timed for the target week.

Summary of what is firmly scheduled and likely to drive Google-Trends interest between 19 and 25 February 2026:
• Imminent public release of the House Oversight deposition video/transcript.  
• Any filing or press release that sets the date for Wexner’s Strauss litigation deposition (deadline 12 Apr 2026, making late February a plausible slot).  
• Possible institutional actions at Ohio State (board agendas, resolutions, or public statements) concerning removal of Wexner’s name or his role as medical-center board chair.

Information gaps:
• Exact release date of the House deposition transcript/video has not been posted.
• The civil-court docket has not yet listed a specific Strauss-case deposition date.
• OSU’s committee calendar for late February is not yet published.

Absent unexpected announcements, no other documentary premieres, legal filings, earnings calls, or philanthropic events featuring Les Wexner are scheduled for 19 – 25 February 2026. All known catalysts for national coverage in that span tie back to the fallout from his 18 February congressional testimony and ongoing litigation.</Agent_report>

The information has been sourced from the internet and language models (for agent reports). Exercise healthy skepticism toward unverified claims.

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.

Subsequently, calibrate your outside view prediction, considering:
(a) You aim to predict the true probability of events occurring, not a hedged or overconfident projection of your beliefs.
(b) Are there previously established distributions concerning the options that you can tether your prediction to?
(c) Small differences in probabilities can be significant: 90% is a 9:1 odds and 99% is a 99:1 odds.
(d) Historically, what is the rate of upsets/unexpected outcomes in the domain of this forecasting question? How should this affect your probability distribution?
