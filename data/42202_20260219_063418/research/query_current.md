Analysis:
The Google-Trends value will only shift meaningfully if something pushes Leslie Wexner into the headlines between now (Feb 19 2026) and Feb 25 2026.  Therefore, I need to look for:
• Fresh or breaking stories published in the last few days (or embargoed for release soon) that feature Wexner—e.g., litigation updates, corporate or philanthropic moves, health reports, or renewed scrutiny of his Epstein ties.  
• Announcements of forthcoming documentaries, TV episodes, podcasts, or books scheduled for release during the target window.  
• Court dockets or scheduled hearings that might trigger coverage.  
• Any Victoria’s Secret-related news that cites Wexner’s past role.  
Finding such catalysts in mainstream or business press will inform whether Google searches are likely to spike, stay flat, or fall.
