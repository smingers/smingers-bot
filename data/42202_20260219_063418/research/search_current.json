A January 13 subpoena sought to depose him.\n\n3. **Motion Denied:** Wexner filed a motion to quash the deposition subpoena, which Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Preston Deavers and District Judge Michael Watson denied on Wednesday (context suggests early February). They ordered Wexner to participate in a deposition within 60 days.\n\n4. **Judicial Reasoning:** The judges stated that given Wexner's tenure on the OSU Board of Trustees, including positions as vice chairman and chairman of the full board, as well as ranking positions on the board's personnel committee, plaintiffs are entitled to discover what Wexner knew about Dr. Strauss and when. His testimony may also illuminate what the board did to monitor OSU's sexual harassment compliance.\n\n5. **Wexner's Defense:** Wexner argued he has no knowledge of the matter and never discussed allegations against Strauss while he was a board member or afterward. The judges deemed this insufficient cause for granting his motion to quash.\n\n6. **Case Background:** The three federal lawsuits were filed by former students naming Ohio State as defendant. They arise from Strauss's time as campus doctor from September 1978 to March 1998. Strauss was accused of sexually abusing at least 177 OSU male student-athletes and died by suicide in 2005, preventing him from being tried in court.\n\n7. **Service of Subpoena:** Alleged victims held protests last year, accusing Wexner, his security staff, and his attorney of preventing process servers from delivering the deposition subpoena. Watson issued the court deposition subpoena on January 13 to negate the need for serving him with the prior subpoena.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.thelantern.com/2026/01/wexners-legal-team-motions-to-quash-subpoena-in-strauss-sex-abuse-lawsuit/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Wexner's legal team motions to quash subpoena in Strauss sex abuse lawsuit\"\n\n**Source:** The Lantern  \n**Date:** January 29, 2026  \n**Author:** Davis Beatty\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n1. **Legal Motion Filed:** Les Wexner's attorneys filed a motion on Tuesday (January 28, 2026) to quash a subpoena seeking to depose Wexner in a class-action lawsuit against Ohio State regarding its handling of Dr. Richard Strauss' sexual abuse.\n\n2. **Background on Strauss Case:** Dr. Richard Strauss sexually abused at least 177 students, mostly male athletes, while working as a physician at Ohio State. Strauss retired in 1998 and died by suicide in 2005.\n\n3. **Wexner's Connection:** Les Wexner was on Ohio State's Board of Trustees during Strauss' tenure at the university. He is the founder of L Brands and chairman of the Wexner Medical Center Board.\n\n4. **Legal Team's Arguments:**\n   - No evidence exists suggesting Wexner has relevant knowledge regarding Strauss or his victims\n   - Wexner is being targeted over other Board of Trustees members due to his public-figure status for media attention purposes\n   - Plaintiffs have examined numerous documents and conducted 40 depositions but found no information linking Wexner to knowledge of Strauss\n\n5. **Subpoena Attempts:** Plaintiffs have attempted to serve a subpoena to Wexner four times, including at his New Albany home, at a Board of Trustees meeting, and through his attorney Matthew Ziegler. A judge recently allowed alternative serving methods including leaving copies with security personnel, mailing to his home, or emailing his attorney.\n\n6. **Other Board Members:** The motion notes that other trustees present during Strauss' tenure (Alex Shumate, 1989-98, and Tamala Longaberger, 1996-2005) have not been targeted for depositions, despite being present at the meeting when Strauss received emeritus status.\n\n7. **Plaintiff's Response:** Steve Snyder-Hill, a lead plaintiff, stated it is reasonable to question Wexner about Board of Trustees involvement with Strauss and denied the subpoenas are a PR stunt.\n\n8. **Recent Related Events:**\n   - December 2025: Survivors protested outside Woody Hayes Athletic Center calling for Wexner's name to be removed from the building\n   - January 22, 2026: Ohio State formally denied a request to remove Wexner's name from the building\n   - Earlier in January 2026: Wexner was also subpoenaed by the U.S. Committee on Oversight Reform for his ties with Jeffrey Epstein\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.sportico.com/leagues/college-sports/2026/les-wexner-deposition-ohio-state-1234884378/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Les Wexner Must Sit for Deposition in Ohio State Sex Abuse Suits\"\n\n**Source:** Sportico.com  \n**Date:** February 11, 2026  \n**Author:** Daniel Libit\n\n## Key Facts and Developments:\n\n1. **Court Ruling:** A federal court ordered billionaire Les Wexner to sit for a deposition in three lawsuits against Ohio State University related to sexual abuse committed by former OSU sports medicine physician Richard Strauss.\n\n2. **Ruling Details:** U.S. District Court Judge Michael H. Watson and U.S. Magistrate Judge Elizabeth Preston Deavers denied Wexner's motion to quash the subpoena on Wednesday (February 11, 2026).\n\n3. **Wexner's OSU Connection:** Wexner donated hundreds of millions of dollars to OSU and served on the school's board of trustees during a period when Strauss was under internal investigation and when his full-time employment positions were terminated. Strauss continued as faculty emeritus until his death by suicide in 2005.\n\n4. **Court's Reasoning:** The judges stated that Wexner's testimony is relevant because of \"the timing and length of Mr. Wexner's tenure on the OSU board of trustees, including his time as vice chairman and chairman of the full board, as well as ranking positions on the board's Personnel Committee.\" Plaintiffs are entitled to discover what Wexner knew about Strauss and when.\n\n5. **Wexner's Position:** Wexner has maintained he never communicated with or about Strauss and was unaware of any allegations during his board tenure. The judges noted that if true, \"this would be evidence of OSU's deliberate indifference.\"\n\n6. **Timeline:** Wexner must appear for deposition within 60 days of the ruling.\n\n7. **Previous Legal Maneuvering:** Wexner and his attorneys had refused to accept the subpoena for months, then argued his testimony was sought for an \"improper publicity-generating purpose.\"\n\n8. **Legal Representation:** Wexner is represented by a Columbus-based law firm whose managing partner, John Zeiger, currently serves as chair of OSU's board of trustees.\n\n9. **Epstein Connection:** The article notes Wexner faces \"increasing international scrutiny\" over his ties to Jeffrey Epstein. This week, the Department of Justice unredacted a 2019 FBI document labeling Wexner as a co-conspirator of Epstein's at Congress' insistence. Wexner has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing related to Epstein.\n\n10. **Name Removal Efforts:** An Ohio State committee is reviewing a second formal request to remove Wexner's name from multiple campus buildings, including the football team's practice facility. The school denied an initial request last month from Stephen Snyder-Hill, a lead plaintiff who was among the first to raise concerns about Strauss in the mid-1990s.\n\n## Statements:\n\n- **Plaintiffs' attorneys (Sarah Bradshaw and Joe Sauder):** \"This ruling represents another important step toward transparency and accountability.\"\n- **Wexner spokesperson:** Did not immediately respond to request for comment.\n- **Ohio State:** Declined to comment.\n</Summary>\n\n<Asknews_articles>\nQuery: Will the interest in \u201cleslie wexner\u201d change between 2026-02-19 and 2026-02-25 according to Google Trends?\nHere are the relevant news articles:\n\n**Billionaire Wexner says he visited Epstein's island but denies knowledge of financier's crimes**\nBillionaire Leslie Wexner, 88, testified before U.S. lawmakers on February 18, 2026, stating he visited Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s private island once, shortly after Epstein acquired it, during a family cruise. He denied any knowledge of Epstein\u2019s criminal activities, asserting he was never a participant or co-conspirator and had cut ties with Epstein around 2007 after Epstein was first criminally charged. Wexner, former CEO and founder of L Brands (owner of Victoria\u2019s Secret), said he hired Epstein as his personal money manager in the 1980s but was later defrauded, claiming Epstein stole 'vast sums' of money from his family. He described Epstein as a 'world-class con man' and expressed 'enormous embarrassment and regret' over having met him. The U.S. Justice Department\u2019s release of Epstein-related documents has intensified scrutiny on his connections to prominent individuals. U.S. Representative Robert Garcia, top Democrat on the House oversight panel, stated Wexner was 'the most involved person in providing Jeffrey Epstein with the financial support to commit his crimes.' Wexner was questioned for six hours behind closed doors and has not been accused of criminal wrongdoing.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 03:45 AM\nSource:[The Straits Times](https://www.straitstimes.com/world/billionaire-wexner-says-he-visited-epsteins-island-but-denies-knowledge-of-financiers-crimes)\n\n**No Longer A Conspiracy Theory: Epstein Was Intelligence**\nAccording to 'The Kim Iversen Show LIVE' on February 18, 2026, new evidence suggests that Jeffrey Epstein was clearly an intelligence asset, moving beyond conspiracy theory status.

Wexner confirmed visiting Epstein\u2019s private Caribbean island once with his wife and children for a few hours, but stated he 'never witnessed nor had any knowledge of Epstein's criminal activity' and 'never saw or heard about Epstein being in the company of a minor girl.' He explicitly rejected the label of 'co-conspirator,' asserting he was neither a participant nor accomplice in Epstein\u2019s crimes. This testimony follows a December 2025 DOJ email identifying Wexner as one of 10 'co-conspirators' in Epstein\u2019s 2019 prosecution, though he was never formally charged. The House Oversight Committee subpoenaed him instead. Wexner\u2019s legal team previously stated he would 'cooperate fully with any governmental inquiry,' noting he was not a target or co-conspirator in the earlier U.S. attorney\u2019s investigation. Wexner, worth over $10 billion, founded L Brands, which owns Victoria\u2019s Secret, Bath & Body Works, and Abercrombie & Fitch.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 01:06 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/news/us-news/epstein-files-billionaire-leslie-wexner-deposes-before-us-house-panel-rejects-co-conspirator-tag-what-he-said-11771460592165.html)\n\n**Billionaire Leslie Wexner Testifies Before Congress on His Ties to Sex Offender Jeffrey Epstein**\nAmerican billionaire Leslie Wexner appeared before the U.S. House Oversight Committee on February 19, 2026, as part of ongoing investigations into his ties with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Wexner described himself in a pre-written statement as 'naive, foolish, and gullible' for placing trust in Epstein, whom he had hired in 1991 to manage his finances. He stated he severed all ties with Epstein nearly 20 years ago, in 2007, after learning of Epstein\u2019s status as a sexual predator, fraudster, and liar. Wexner, former chairman of Victoria\u2019s Secret, insisted he was unaware of Epstein\u2019s crimes during their partnership. According to The Wall Street Journal, Wexner was central to Epstein\u2019s financial success, with reports indicating Epstein earned $200 million from their business relationship. Democratic lawmakers, including Robert Garcia and David Min, criticized Wexner\u2019s testimony, calling it implausible. Garcia emphasized that Wexner was one of the most significant financial supporters of Epstein\u2019s criminal activities. Min challenged Wexner\u2019s claim of ignorance, noting that Epstein\u2019s reputation was widely known and that Wexner\u2019s repeated presence in Epstein\u2019s company made it unreasonable to claim he saw or heard nothing. Wexner maintained that Epstein had 'embezzled' $46 million from his assets. The closed-door hearing, held at Wexner\u2019s home in Ohio, was attended only by Democratic members and their staff, with no Republican congressmembers present.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 12:01 AM\nSource:[RT Arabic](https://arabic.rt.com/world/1759218-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D9%8A%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83%D9%8A-%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%B3-%D9%88%D9%8A%D9%83%D8%B3%D9%86%D8%B1-%D9%8A%D8%B4%D9%87%D8%AF-%D8%A3%D9%85%D8%A7%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%83%D9%88%D9%86%D8%BA%D8%B1%D8%B3-%D8%A8%D8%B4%D8%A3%D9%86-%D8%B9%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%82%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%87-%D8%A8%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%AC%D8%B1%D9%85-%D8%A7%D9%84%D8%AC%D9%86%D8%B3%D9%8A-%D8%A5%D8%A8%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%86/)\n\n**Leslie Wexner\u2019s Epstein Ties: Billionaire Retailer Faces Congressional Inquiry Amid Allegations of Hidden Connections**\nThe U.S. House Oversight Committee is questioning Leslie Wexner, the retail magnate and billionaire from Ohio, about his relationship with the convicted sex offender and financier Jeffrey Epstein. The hearing was moved from Washington, D.C., to Ohio, Wexner\u2019s home state, following congressional demands by Representatives Thomas Massie and Ro Khanna for the FBI to disclose Wexner\u2019s identity, which had been redacted in internal FBI documents released in January. An FBI document from 2019 classified Wexner as a 'co-conspirator' alongside Epstein, Ghislaine Maxwell, Jean-Luc Brunel, Karina Schoula\u00efk, and four others. The document appears linked to sex trafficking charges against Epstein and possibly the investigation into his death. However, in 2019, the U.S. Department of Justice informed Wexner\u2019s legal team that he was not a co-conspirator or target of any investigation, after he provided information on Epstein and was not contacted again. Wexner, worth $9 billion, claims he severed ties with Epstein in 2008 and denies knowing about his crimes. A federal prosecutors\u2019 86-page memo from 2019 includes two pages on a meeting with Wexner\u2019s lawyers, who alleged Epstein stole or embezzled hundreds of millions from him\u2014Wexner estimated $200 million, saying Epstein gradually took control of his personal finances without oversight. Epstein returned $100 million in January 2008, the year Wexner says he cut contact. Despite Wexner\u2019s denials and claims of a purely professional relationship, his name appears over 1,300 times in the Department of Justice\u2019s Epstein files, including emails, interviews, and lawsuits post-2008. A draft, undated letter from Epstein to Wexner states: 'I never did anything but protect your interests... You owe me as much as I owe you... We had shared matters for over 15 years.' Wexner\u2019s spokesperson denies receiving this letter. Wexner was a key source of Epstein\u2019s wealth and influence. In a 2020 testimony, a former IT contractor for Epstein said Wexner was always the top priority in Epstein\u2019s rapid contact list. Wexner built a retail empire\u2014including Victoria\u2019s Secret, Express, Bath & Body Works, and The Limited\u2014starting in 1963 with a $5,000 loan from his aunt. He met Epstein in the 1980s through a mutual friend, was named financial advisor, given broad powers, and appointed trustee of Epstein\u2019s children\u2019s trust fund in 1991. Epstein was listed as co-chairman of Wexner\u2019s New Albany company, though with no operational role. In 1996, a young artist alleged sexual assault by Epstein and Maxwell at a property owned by Wexner, where she was detained by security for 12 hours. The family\u2019s representative denied knowledge of the case, and the lawsuit was dropped after a settlement with a victims\u2019 compensation fund. In 1998, Wexner sold his Manhattan mansion\u2014seven floors, 40 rooms\u2014for $20 million to a company controlled by Epstein, despite the property later being valued at $56 million after Epstein\u2019s death. The house became a suspected site of multiple assaults. Although Wexner insists he ended ties with Epstein nearly two decades ago, post-2008 emails suggest ongoing ambiguous connections. Despite being classified as a co-conspirator in FBI documents, internal 2019 communications noted limited evidence against him. The fallout was significant: Wexner stepped down as CEO and Chairman of L Brands in May 2020 after 57 years and left the board entirely in 2021. Nonetheless, he has continued growing his wealth through real estate and AI investments and currently chairs the Wexner Medical Center Board at Ohio State University. He is also expected to testify in a lawsuit involving a former university doctor accused of sexual abuse of students. His upcoming testimony is anticipated to reaffirm his denials and disavowal of any connection to Jeffrey Epstein.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 07:46 PM\nSource:[\u0627\u0644\u0645\u0635\u0631\u064a \u0644\u0627\u064a\u062a](https://lite.almasryalyoum.com/extra/381081/)\n\n**Les Wexner confirms visit to Epstein's island during testimony - Bloomberg By Investing.com**\nBillionaire Leslie Wexner testified before a U.S. House panel on February 18, 2026, confirming he visited Jeffrey Epstein's private Caribbean island once with his family for a few hours while on a boat trip.

The deposition, conducted by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee with bipartisan support, follows the Department of Justice's release of millions of additional Epstein-related files that revealed new connections between Jeffrey Epstein and prominent figures in business and politics. Wexner, who had granted Epstein power of attorney over his finances decades earlier and was Epstein's only publicly known client, has not been charged with any crime. After Epstein's arrest in July 2019 and subsequent suicide in jail, Wexner stated he was 'embarrassed to have been taken advantage of by someone who is... so depraved.' The Wexner Foundation did not respond to CNBC's request for comment on the deposition.

The hearing, initially scheduled in Washington, D.C., is instead taking place at Wexner's estate in New Albany, Ohio. According to members of Congress, Wexner is among the 'rich and powerful men' whose names were removed from the U.S. Department of Justice's released Epstein-related documents on January 30, 2026. Wexner is a central figure in the Jeffrey Epstein scandal due to his financial ties to the convicted sex offender.\nOriginal language: fr\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 04:00 PM\nSource:[Ouest France](https://www.ouest-france.fr/monde/etats-unis/jeffrey-epstein/affaire-epstein-audition-de-leslie-wexner-lhomme-a-lorigine-de-la-fortune-du-pedophile-470fc00c-0cce-11f1-a992-d10c268d755d)\n\n**Epstein files show years of FBI interest in Les Wexner, Epstein's mysterious benefactor**\nThe release of Department of Justice (DOJ) Epstein files has reignited scrutiny of Les Wexner, the former Victoria's Secret owner and billionaire retail magnate, who has long been a mysterious figure in Jeffrey Epstein's orbit. Though Wexner's name was initially redacted in a 'co-conspirator' document, hundreds of other records reveal federal authorities have repeatedly investigated him, including subpoenas in 2019 and interviews with his attorneys. The files include allegations that Wexner interacted with underage girls in Epstein's presence, was allegedly targeted for trafficking, and had a financial relationship with Epstein that included power of attorney and the sale of assets at deeply discounted prices. Epstein\u2019s own letters suggest a long-standing, confidential relationship, though Wexner\u2019s spokesperson denies receiving them. Wexner has consistently denied any knowledge of or participation in Epstein\u2019s crimes, stating he was 'embarrassed' by his association and cooperated with law enforcement, who told him in 2019 he was neither a co-conspirator nor a target. Despite this, FBI documents from 2019 list him as a 'secondary' co-conspirator with limited evidence. Additional tips from former bodyguards and other individuals allege Wexner was present during events involving young women, claims Wexner\u2019s team denies. In 2026, Wexner is scheduled to testify under oath before the House Oversight Committee, marking a pivotal moment in the investigation into Epstein\u2019s enablers. The DOJ files, while not alleging criminal charges against Wexner, show sustained federal interest in his role, with Rep. Thomas Massie calling the redactions a 'cover-up spanning decades' and likening it to Watergate. The investigation continues to focus on financial ties and enabling behavior.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 11:00 AM\nSource:[CNN International](https://edition.cnn.com/2026/02/18/us/les-wexner-epstein-files-ohio-invs)\n\n**Les Wexner Testifies To Congress Today About Epstein Files Amid New Emails**\nBillionaire Leslie Wexner is testifying before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, marking the first time a high-profile associate of the late financier has appeared before Congress since the release of millions of Epstein-related documents in late January 2026. Wexner, former head of L Brands, is a known major financial client of Epstein and is under investigation as part of the House Oversight Committee's probe into Epstein's network. Despite being never formally accused of any wrongdoing, Wexner has denied having knowledge of Epstein's alleged sexual abuse. The testimony is part of an ongoing congressional investigation, and the story is developing, with updates expected.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 12:00 AM\nSource:[Forbes](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alisondurkee/2026/02/18/les-wexner-testifies-to-congress-today-about-epstein-files-amid-new-emails/)\n\n**Unredacted Epstein files, deposition plans bring Jewish philanthropist Leslie Wexner into spotlight**\nLeslie Wexner, the 88-year-old founder of L Brands and the Wexner Foundation, has come under renewed public scrutiny following the unredaction of his name in the Epstein Files released by the U.S. Department of Justice on January 30, 2026, under the Epstein Files Transparency Act. U.S. Representative Ro Khanna publicly named Wexner as one of six powerful men whose identities were previously redacted, citing FBI documents that labeled him an 'unindicted co-conspirator'\u2014though the files also note 'limited evidence' against him. Wexner has not been charged with any crime and has repeatedly denied knowledge of Jeffrey Epstein\u2019s sex-trafficking offenses. Their relationship began in the late 1980s when Wexner hired Epstein as a financial adviser; Epstein was granted power of attorney in 1991, and federal records show he used that authority in property transactions. A 2008 settlement saw Epstein pay Wexner $100 million after Wexner accused him of theft. Wexner, long regarded as a towering philanthropist in the Jewish community for funding fellowships and Jewish education, now faces ethical and reputational challenges due to his association with Epstein. At least two rabbis have publicly committed to donating to sex trafficking victims as a form of atonement for benefits received through Wexner\u2019s programs. Wexner is scheduled to give a sworn deposition before the U.S. House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform on February 18, 2026, in a closed session; the committee has not confirmed whether the transcript will be made public.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 12, 2026 04:30 AM\nSource:[The Jerusalem Post](https://www.jpost.com/international/article-886415)\n\n**Victoria's Secret (VSCO) Faces Scrutiny Amid Wexner's Past Involvement**\nVictoria's Secret (VSCO) is facing increased scrutiny due to its historical ties to Leslie Wexner, the former CEO of L Brands and a prominent figure in the company's development.

Epstein, who died by suicide in 2019 while awaiting trial on sex trafficking charges, previously served as Wexner's financial advisor. Wexner claims he severed ties with Epstein in 2007, but records show they remained in contact in 2008. The DOJ confirmed that Wexner's name had been redacted from documents, but it was later removed, with Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche stating Wexner's name appears 'thousands of times' in the files and that the DOJ is not hiding anything. Wexner's representatives deny any knowledge of Epstein's crimes, asserting he was a victim of financial fraud. Documents reveal Epstein allegedly stole hundreds of millions from Wexner, and in 2008, Epstein paid Wexner $100 million\u2014later described as a settlement\u2014after a financial dispute. The DOJ stated Epstein's assets were effectively built on Wexner's wealth. Wexner's legal team informed prosecutors in 2019 that he was not a target and cooperated fully, providing background information on Epstein. The release of these documents followed a congressional law passed in 2025 requiring transparency. Despite being labeled a 'co-conspirator' in some internal FBI communications and classified as a 'secondary conspirator' in others, Wexner\u2019s legal team maintains his innocence. The documents also show Epstein purchased properties and a private jet from Wexner at below-market prices. Wexner stepped down from leadership roles in 2020 after the sale of Victoria's Secret. The Department of Justice's disclosure process has been criticized by lawmakers like Congressman Jamie Raskin, who called the redactions 'mysterious' and demanded access to unredacted files. Wexner, now in his late 80s, has expressed regret over his association with Epstein and stated he was unaware of any illegal activities by Epstein involving minors.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 10, 2026 07:08 PM\nSource:[\u0639\u0631\u0628\u064a21](https://arabi21.com/story/1737168/%D8%B1%D9%81%D8%B9-%D8%AD%D8%AC%D8%A8-%D8%A7%D8%B3%D9%85-%D9%85%D9%84%D9%8A%D8%A7%D8%B1%D8%AF%D9%8A%D8%B1-%D9%8A%D9%87%D9%88%D8%AF%D9%8A-%D8%AF%D8%A7%D8%B9%D9%85-%D9%84%D9%80-%D8%A5%D8%B3%D8%B1%D8%A7%D8%A6%D9%8A%D9%84-%D9%85%D9%86-%D9%85%D9%84%D9%81%D8%A7%D8%AA-%D8%A5%D8%A8%D8%B3%D8%AA%D9%8A%D9%86-%D8%B4%D8%B1%D9%8A%D9%83-%D9%81%D9%8A-%D8%A7%D9%84%D9%85%D8%A4%D8%A7%D9%85%D8%B1%D8%A9)\n\n**New details revealed as lawmakers depose billionaire: 'Focused on Epstein's inner circle'**\nThe House Oversight Committee is set to depose retail billionaire Leslie Wexner on February 18, 2026, in a closed-door session related to his ties with Jeffrey Epstein, a late convicted child sex offender. According to MS NOW reporter Fallon Gallagher, the committee is 'deeply focused on Epstein's inner circle.' Wexner, founder of The Limited and former financial benefactor of Epstein, had a long-standing personal and business relationship with Epstein, who managed his finances and was described by Wexner as 'very smart, with a combination of excellent judgment and unusually high standards' and 'a most loyal friend,' per a 2003 Vanity Fair article. Wexner claims he severed ties with Epstein in the 1990s after becoming suspicious of his behavior and was unaware of Epstein\u2019s criminal activities. However, an FBI document from December 2025 listed Wexner as an alleged co-conspirator. Wexner maintains he has had no wrongdoing. The deposition is part of a broader series of high-profile hearings, including a virtual deposition of Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein\u2019s close confidant, who plans to plead the fifth. A transcript or video of Wexner\u2019s testimony may be released later.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 06, 2026 06:55 PM\nSource:[Raw Story](https://www.rawstory.com/new-details-revealed-as-lawmakers-depose-billionaire-focused-on-epsteins-inner-circle/)\n\n**Google's 2026 Year In Search -- Mikey Madison, Justin Baldoni & 'The Hunting Wives' Land On Trend Report**\nGoogle released its 2025 Year in Search report on December 4, 2025, highlighting the most-searched topics globally and in the U.S. The report identifies trending entertainment searches based on sustained spikes in traffic throughout the year.

The show aimed to rebuild its legacy through inclusivity, featuring retired models, diverse body types, and the elimination of the 'fantasy bra' due to its objectification connotations. Despite these changes, the event faced criticism for limited ethnic diversity, particularly among Black, African, Latin, and Asian models, with the majority of featured models still being white or European. The show also reignited scrutiny over the brand\u2019s past, including allegations of abuse, grooming, and sexual misconduct by former marketing director Ed Razek, who made discriminatory remarks about transgender and plus-size models and was accused of touching models and pressuring them for sexual favors. Testimonies from former models like Cameron Russell and Erin Heatherton described degrading audition processes likened to 'auctioning livestock' and severe mental health impacts. The brand\u2019s ties to Jeffrey Epstein, who had access to backstage areas and used his connections with Leslie Wexner and Razek to exploit young women, were also exposed in court documents. One model, Bianca Balti, was rejected from the 2025 show despite her advocacy for diversity, and the company did not respond to inquiries. The physical demands on models remain extreme, with some achieving ultra-low body fat levels (as low as 13%) to meet aesthetic standards, risking serious health consequences. The brand now faces a critical challenge: to honor its legacy while transforming to meet modern values of authenticity, diversity, and accountability.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: October 25, 2025 08:28 PM\nSource:[Todo Noticias](https://tn.com.ar/show/hollywood/2025/10/25/las-historias-ocultas-detras-de-los-angeles-de-victorias-secret-abuso-castings-humillantes-y-la-cancelacion/)\n\n**Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2025: Models, Performances, and How to Watch**\nThe Victoria's Secret Fashion Show 2025 will take place on Wednesday, October 15, 2025, featuring top models including Brazilian icons Adriana Lima and Alessandra Ambr\u00f3sio.

Wexner, who was linked to Jeffrey Epstein. The 2025 edition emphasizes inclusivity, featuring models of diverse body types, ages, and backgrounds, including Valentina Sampaio, the first transgender woman to appear in a Victoria's Secret campaign.
