Robert Garcia\n   - Rep. Stephen Lynch\n   - Rep. Jasmine Crockett\n   - Rep. Yasmin Ansari\n   - Rep. Dave Min\n\n3. **Location Change:** Wexner was originally ordered to appear before the committee in a closed-door meeting in Washington, D.C., according to a subpoena. However, the location of the deposition was changed to Wexner's mansion/estate in New Albany, Ohio.\n\n4. **Press Conference:** After the deposition, the Democratic representatives held a news conference in an empty lot in downtown New Albany, Ohio.\n\n## Context:\n\nThe article primarily consists of photo captions describing the news conference held by Congressional Democrats following Wexner's deposition. The deposition focused on Wexner's relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, who is described as Wexner's former financial adviser and accused child sex trafficker.\n\n**Note:** The article appears to be primarily a photo gallery with repeated caption text. No direct quotes from the representatives or specific details about the content of the deposition are provided in the extracted content.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Identify any scheduled media releases, court hearings, or major announcements involving Leslie Wexner in the United States between February 19 and 25 2026; include documentary premieres, legal filings, earnings calls, or philanthropic events likely to attract national coverage.\nThe search produced abundant contemporaneous news coverage of Les Wexner\u2019s 18 February 2026 closed-door deposition before the House Oversight & Reform Committee and of related controversies, but it yielded only a handful of items that qualify as \u201cscheduled\u201d events falling inside the target window of 19 \u2013 25 February 2026.\n\n1. Congressional deposition \u2013 release of video and transcript (likely during 19 \u2013 25 Feb).\n   \u2022 Ranking member Rep. James Comer told reporters that a video recording and full transcript of the 6-hour deposition \u201care to be released soon\u201d (KWQC/AP, 19 Feb 2026; Marietta Times/AP, 18 Feb 2026).  No exact publication date has been announced, but Committee practice is to post such materials within several business days.  If released between 19 and 25 February, the publication itself will be a fresh piece of primary material and will generate another wave of national coverage focused on Wexner.\n\n2. Federal court\u2013ordered deposition in the Richard Strauss-Ohio State survivor lawsuit (deadline falls in the window but the session date is not yet on the docket).\n   \u2022 On 12 February 2026 U.S. District Judge Michael Watson ordered Wexner to sit for a civil deposition \u201cwithin 60 days\u201d (NBC News, 12 Feb 2026).  Attorneys have not yet calendared the precise date publicly.  Therefore, a Strauss-case deposition could, but will not necessarily, occur between 19 and 25 February.  If noticed for that period, it would attract regional and likely national press, given the Epstein context.\n\n3. Potential supplemental House Oversight interviews with Wexner-linked figures.\n   \u2022 Committee Democrats said on 18 February that they will next turn to other individuals who received money from Wexner or Epstein, naming OSU OB-GYN Dr. Mark Landon (WOSU, 18 Feb 2026).  No dates have been published, but any public notice of additional subpoenas or depositions could land in the target week and reignite Google searches on Wexner\u2019s name.\n\n4. Institutional actions concerning Wexner\u2019s philanthropy and naming rights.\n   \u2022 Ohio State University confirmed multiple pending requests to remove Wexner\u2019s name from campus entities and provided a portal for formal petitions (Columbus Dispatch, 17 Feb 2026).  The school has not published meeting dates for its Board of Trustees or Naming Committee during 19 \u2013 25 Feb, but should either body place the issue on an agenda, coverage would be statewide and possibly national, especially if a vote is imminent.\n\n5. No evidence of documentary premieres, television specials, or podcast series tied specifically to the 19\u201325 Feb window.\n   \u2022 The major Epstein-related documentary projects now streaming (e.g., Hulu\u2019s \u201cVictoria\u2019s Secret: Angels and Demons,\u201d Netflix\u2019s \u201cJeffrey Epstein: Filthy Rich\u201d) debuted years earlier, and no sources mention a forthcoming episode or film launch during the week in question.\n\n6. No scheduled corporate events.\n   \u2022 Wexner resigned from L Brands (since split into Bath & Body Works Inc. and the private Victoria\u2019s Secret & Co.) in 2020.  Neither successor company lists Wexner on its boards, and their earnings calls fall outside the 19 \u2013 25 Feb interval; consequently, Wexner is not expected to appear on any publicly traded company\u2019s earnings call that week.\n\n7. No philanthropic galas or public-facing Wexner Foundation events announced for 19 \u2013 25 Feb.\n   \u2022 Public calendars for the Wexner Foundation and OSU Wexner Medical Center show routine academic \u201cMedTips\u201d releases (OSU Wexner Medical Center, 13 Feb 2026) but nothing bearing directly on Les Wexner that is timed for the target week.\n\nSummary of what is firmly scheduled and likely to drive Google-Trends interest between 19 and 25 February 2026:\n\u2022 Imminent public release of the House Oversight deposition video/transcript.  \n\u2022 Any filing or press release that sets the date for Wexner\u2019s Strauss litigation deposition (deadline 12 Apr 2026, making late February a plausible slot).  \n\u2022 Possible institutional actions at Ohio State (board agendas, resolutions, or public statements) concerning removal of Wexner\u2019s name or his role as medical-center board chair.\n\nInformation gaps:\n\u2022 Exact release date of the House deposition transcript/video has not been posted.\n\u2022 The civil-court docket has not yet listed a specific Strauss-case deposition date.\n\u2022 OSU\u2019s committee calendar for late February is not yet published.\n\nAbsent unexpected announcements, no other documentary premieres, legal filings, earnings calls, or philanthropic events featuring Les Wexner are scheduled for 19 \u2013 25 February 2026. All known catalysts for national coverage in that span tie back to the fallout from his 18 February congressional testimony and ongoing litigation.</Agent_report>\n\n<GoogleTrendsData term=\"leslie wexner\">\nGoogle Trends US data for \"leslie wexner\" (last 90 days):\n\nCurrent value: 19\n90-day mean: 4.3\n90-day std dev: 14.2\n\nBASE RATE ANALYSIS (using 6-day windows to match question timeframe):\n- In 85% of 6-day windows, the value changed by \u22643 points (\"Doesn't change\")\n- In 9% of 6-day windows, the value INCREASED by >3 points\n- In 6% of 6-day windows, the value DECREASED by >3 points\n\nRecent trend: decreasing (last 7 days avg: 13.0 vs prior 7 days: 33.9)\n\nDAILY VALUES (last 30 days):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-21,0\n2026-01-22,0\n2026-01-23,0\n2026-01-24,0\n2026-01-25,0\n2026-01-26,2\n2026-01-27,0\n2026-01-28,0\n2026-01-29,0\n2026-01-30,0\n2026-01-31,3\n2026-02-01,4\n2026-02-02,2\n2026-02-03,3\n2026-02-04,3\n2026-02-05,3\n2026-02-06,4\n2026-02-07,4\n2026-02-08,5\n2026-02-09,3\n2026-02-10,83\n2026-02-11,100\n2026-02-12,38\n2026-02-13,18\n2026-02-14,13\n2026-02-15,13\n2026-02-16,9\n2026-02-17,7\n2026-02-18,12\n2026-02-19,19\n\nNote: Google Trends values are relative (0-100 scale), not absolute search volumes.\n</GoogleTrendsData>\n"
