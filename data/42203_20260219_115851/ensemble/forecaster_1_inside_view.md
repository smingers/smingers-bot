## (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong Evidence:**
1. **FRED data stability (Feb 17: 3.63%):** Multiple weeks of 1bp oscillation between 3.63-3.64%. This is the most reliable indicator for Feb 25 given only 4 business days separation.
   - **Weight: Very Strong** - Direct, authoritative, recent data from resolution source

2. **Auction timing and historical patterns:** Feb 24 auction occurs 1 day before resolution. Historical evidence shows Treasury auctions cause minimal secondary market disruption (typically 0-5bp unless highly unusual).
   - **Weight: Strong** - Well-established institutional pattern

**Moderate Evidence:**
1. **3-month bill at 3.68% (Feb 17):** Dr. van Deventer's report shows 3-month at 3.68%, slightly above 4-week. These typically track closely, suggesting 4-week should be in 3.60-3.70% range.
   - **Weight: Moderate** - Single credible expert source, logical relationship between maturities

2. **Fed policy stance:** No Fed meeting until March 17-18, FOMC minutes already released Feb 18. Market expects stability.
   - **Weight: Moderate** - Clear institutional factor but already priced into current rates

3. **Recent auction trend:** InstaForex data shows gradual decline from 3.90% (Nov) to 3.59-3.60% (Jan), suggesting downward momentum has stabilized.
   - **Weight: Moderate** - Demonstrates trend but data is from primary auctions, not secondary market

**Weak Evidence:**
1. **VT Markets opinion:** Analyst expects continued stability and "holding pattern"
   - **Weight: Weak** - Single non-expert opinion, speculative

2. **Trading Economics forecast (3.68% for Q1 end):** Suggests slight upward drift
   - **Weight: Weak** - Methodology unclear, generic forecast service

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 6 calendar days (4 business days: Feb 20, 21, 24, 25) from last observation (Feb 17) to resolution (Feb 25).

**If timeframe were halved (2 business days):**
- Would increase confidence in status quo outcome (3.63%)
- Distribution would narrow significantly - perhaps 10th percentile at 3.58%, 90th at 3.68%
- Auction risk would be eliminated (no auction in 2-day window)

**If timeframe were doubled (8 business days):**
- Would decrease confidence in precise prediction
- Distribution would widen - perhaps 10th percentile at 3.45%, 90th at 3.85%
- More time for unexpected economic data, Fed speakers, or market events
- Additional auction cycle could occur

**Current 4-business-day timeframe assessment:**
- Short enough that extreme stability should persist
- Long enough to include Feb 24 auction risk
- Optimal balance suggests moderate distribution width

## (d) Justification

**Factors supporting minimal change from 3.63%:**

1. **Unprecedented recent stability (Strong):** The 1bp range over 13 business days (Jan 30-Feb 17) is extraordinary. This suggests market has reached equilibrium pricing given current Fed policy and economic conditions.

2. **No major catalysts (Strong):** Fed in explicit hold mode until March, FOMC minutes already absorbed, no major economic releases scheduled between Feb 19-25 that would affect 4-week bills.

3. **Short timeframe (Strong):** Only 4 business days creates high inertia - rates don't typically move significantly over such short periods without specific triggers.

**Factors supporting modest upward bias:**

1. **3-month bill premium (Moderate):** The 3-month at 3.68% vs 4-week at 3.63% suggests a 5bp term premium. This is normal but indicates market pricing slightly higher rates ahead.

2. **Auction timing (Moderate risk factor):** Feb 24 auction creates uncertainty. While typical impact is 0-5bp, weak demand could push secondary market rates up 10-15bp.

3. **Trading Economics forecast (Weak):** 3.68% end-Q1 forecast suggests gradual upward drift, though methodology unclear.

**Shift from outside view:**

The outside view suggested 10th-90th percentile range of 3.50-3.80% (30bp spread). The inside view evidence justifies **narrowing** this distribution:

- Recent stability is more extreme than typical Fed hold periods (1bp vs typical 5-10bp weekly range)
- No major catalysts identified in the specific 4-day window
- Last observation is very recent (only 2 business days old when question opened)

However, I must **maintain some width** to account for:
- Feb 24 auction uncertainty (could cause 5-10bp move)
- Unexpected news events (geopolitical, economic data surprises)
- Technical/liquidity factors around month-end

**Final justification:** The combination of extreme recent stability (strong evidence) and short timeframe (strong evidence) justifies a tighter distribution centered very close to 3.63%. The auction risk (moderate evidence) and slight upward bias from 3-month premium (moderate evidence) warrant a modest upward skew but not a major shift. The distribution should be narrower than the outside view but not so narrow as to ignore realistic auction and news risks.

## Distribution Calibration

**Central tendency:** Should be tightly centered around 3.63-3.65%, with slight upward bias.

**10th percentile (3.52%):** Accounts for:
- Unexpected flight-to-safety event (geopolitical shock, market stress)
- Auction showing very strong demand, pushing secondary rates down
- Represents ~11bp downside from current 3.63%
- Probability ~10% seems appropriate given recent stability

**20th percentile (3.58%):** 
- Minor negative surprise or continuation of any downward momentum
- ~5bp below current level
- More likely than 10th percentile scenario

**40th percentile (3.63%):**
- Status quo outcome - rate unchanged from Feb 17
- Given extreme recent stability, this should have substantial probability mass
- Placing at 40th percentile (rather than 50th) acknowledges slight upward bias

**60th percentile (3.66%):**
- Modest upward drift consistent with 3-month bill premium
- Small auction-related increase
- ~3bp above current level

**80th percentile (3.71%):**
- Auction shows weaker demand, pushing rates up
- Unexpected hawkish Fed speaker comments
- ~8bp above current level

**90th percentile (3.78%):**
- Significant auction weakness or unexpected inflation data
- Major market stress requiring higher risk premiums
- ~15bp above current level
- Represents tail risk that should be acknowledged but is unlikely given recent stability

**Distribution shape:** Slightly right-skewed (upward bias) but relatively symmetric. The 10th-90th range of 3.52-3.78% (26bp spread) is narrower than the outside view's 3.50-3.80% (30bp spread), reflecting the stronger-than-typical stability evidence.

## Checklist:

1. **Target variable:** 4-Week Treasury Bill Secondary Market Rate (DTB4WK) on February 25, 2026, measured in percent, from FRED database.
   - ✓ Analysis focuses precisely on this rate and date

2. **Outside view base rate:** 10th: 3.50%, 90th: 3.80% (30bp spread)
   - ✓ Inside view (3.52-3.78%, 26bp spread) is rooted to this but slightly narrower due to extreme recent stability

3. **Consistency check:**
   - Implied median ≈ 3.64-3.65%; mean ≈ 3.65%
   - ✓ Makes sense: slight upward bias from current 3.63% due to auction risk and 3-month premium, but very close to status quo

4. **Three most significant pieces of evidence:**
   - FRED data: 3.63% on Feb 17, only 1bp range over 13 business days (factually verified ✓)
   - Feb 24 auction occurs 1 day before resolution; typical impact 0-5bp (institutional pattern ✓)
   - 3-month bill at 3.68% suggests 4-week in 3.60-3.70% range (expert source verified ✓)
   - No Fed meeting until March; FOMC minutes already released (factually verified ✓)

5. **Blind-spot scenario:**
   - Feb 24 auction shows unexpectedly weak demand (e.g., due to sudden Treasury supply concerns or international selling), causing 15-20bp spike to 3.78-3.83%
   - This would push outcome **upward** beyond my 90th percentile
   - Probability: Low (~5-10%) but non-negligible given current debt ceiling discussions

6. **Status quo outcome:**
   - Status quo = 3.63% (last observation)
   - Volatility: Extremely low recently (1bp range)
   - Timeframe: Very short (4 business days)
   - ✓ My distribution appropriately centers near status quo with 40th percentile at 3.63%

7. **Technicalities:**
   - ✓ Percentiles strictly increasing: 3.52 < 3.58 < 3.63 < 3.66 < 3.71 < 3.78
   - ✓ Units in Percent as requested
   - ✓ Values within bounds: 3.0175 < all values < 4.93971
