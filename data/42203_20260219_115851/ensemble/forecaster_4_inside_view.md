Analysis:

(a) Source analysis (chronological, most recent first)
1. FRED DTB4WK series page (updated 2026-02-17): shows latest observation 3.63 % on 2026-02-17. High-quality primary data, no opinion content.  
2. VT Markets note (2026-02-13): reports 4-week auction yield 3.63 %, unchanged; interprets as “pause” in Fed expectations. Facts: auction yield. Opinions: trading views. Medium quality (broker commentary).  
3. Yahoo/CapitalSpectator pieces (2026-02-17): long-rate discussion, confirms soft macro data and two Fed cuts priced for 2026. Indirect relevance; moderate quality.  
4. TradingEconomics current quote & Q1 forecast (accessed 2026-02-19): last price 3.69 %, model forecast end-Q1 3.68 %. Methodology opaque → moderate quality trend indicator.  
5. Auction calendar (U.S. Treasury): next 4-week bill auction scheduled Tue 2026-02-24 (settlement Thu 2026-02-26). High-quality, structural fact.  
No other sources contain verifiable, near-dated numbers for the 4-week bill.

(b) Evidence weighting
• Strong: FRED last print 3.63 %; auction fact pattern (weekly, usually small moves).  
• Moderate: VT Markets confirmation of 3.63 % at last auction; TradingEconomics slight uptick forecast to ~3.68 %.  
• Weak: Macroeconomic commentary on 10-year yields; long-dated simulations.

(c) Timeframe
Forecast horizon: 6 calendar days (~4 trading days).  
If horizon halved (3 days) → even less scope for change (distribution ~15 % narrower).  
If doubled (12 days) → greater chance of new data (e.g., early March FOMC testimony); widen tails ~25 %.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments
Base-rate pattern: during 2025-26, week-to-week moves in DTB4WK when no FOMC meeting average ±4 bp, 90 % within ±15 bp.  
Current trend: flat at 3.63–3.64 % for three consecutive prints; last three auctions came in 3.59 – 3.64 %.  
Near triggers: Feb 24 auction could nudge the series; TradingEconomics model and mild risk-off bid suggest slight upward drift (funding premium ahead of quarter-end still a month away).  
No scheduled Fed decision, CPI or PCE before 25 Feb; surprise shocks improbable but allow 10–15 bp tails.

Hence I pull the median a hair higher (3.65 %) than the outside-view 3.63 %, keep a symmetric-ish 10–90 range of roughly –15/+17 bp.

Distribution calibration

Percentile – Value (%):
10th  3.50 (≈ –13 bp vs. last)  
20th  3.55  
40th  3.62  
60th  3.66  
80th  3.72  
90th  3.80 (≈ +17 bp vs. last)

Checklist:
1. Target variable: FRED DTB4WK percent value for observation dated 2026-02-25 (or closest, per rules).  
2. Outside-view distribution stated above.  
3. Implied median ≈ 3.64 – 3.65 %, mean ≈ 3.66 %; consistent with small-move logic.  
4. Key evidence: (i) FRED 3.63 % print 17 Feb; (ii) Feb 13 auction 3.63 %; (iii) auction cycle every Tuesday; (iv) no FOMC meeting pre-25 Feb; (v) TradingEconomics 3.68 % Q1 forecast.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden funding-stress spike (e.g., large TGA drain) could lift bills > 4 %; would push forecast high.  
6. Status-quo bias checked – small nudge toward current level retained.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units in percent; within open bounds.
