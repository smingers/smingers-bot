Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED DTB4WK series (latest print 3.64 % on 12 Feb 2026).  Primary data, revised if necessary, released by the Federal Reserve.  Factual, highest reliability, time-stamped daily/weekly.  
2. U.S. Treasury daily‐rate page (link in background).  Same underlying data as FRED, confirms the “bank-discount” definition.  Pure fact, high quality, dated 18 Feb 2026.  
3. VT-Markets note (13 Feb 2026).  Reports 4-wk auction yield 3.63 % and states “unchanged from prior auction”.  Factual auction number (publicly verifiable) plus author opinion about Fed policy.  Evidence portion = the 3.63 % print; opinions down-weighted.  
4. TradingEconomics ticker (19 Feb 2026).  OTC quote 3.69 %, provides automated model forecast 3.68 % for “end of Q1”.  Single proprietary feed, methodology opaque → moderate quality.  
5. AskNews/Yahoo/Seeking Alpha articles on the 10-yr, 3-mo, etc.  Contain no direct figures for 4-wk bills; provide macro backdrop (softening inflation, expectation of no near-term Fed move).  Treated as context only.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong evidence  
• FRED and Treasury prints: 4-wk bill sitting 3.63-3.64 % for every business day since 30 Jan 2026 (6 consecutive observations).  
• No scheduled FOMC decision before 25 Feb; Fed funds futures <2 % probability of a March cut → policy anchor stable (structural factor).  
Moderate evidence  
• 13 Feb auction at 3.63 % points to firm demand and minimal upward pressure.  
• TradingEconomics 3.69 % quote suggests small uptick in dealer screens, but single source.  
Weak evidence  
• General commentary about lower long-term yields and tech-stock volatility; only indirectly influences 4-wk bills.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Outcome in 6 calendar days (4 business days).  One-week historical σ of DTB4WK in the current easing-pause regime (Jul 2024-Feb 2026) ≈ 4 bp.  Halving the horizon (2 days) would shrink expected σ to ~3 bp; doubling it (12 days) would raise it to ~6 bp and marginally widen the distribution.

(d) Justification / inside-view shift  
Base-rate distribution (centred 3.64 %, 80 % width 0.27 %) implied a symmetric 40/60 pair at 3.62 / 3.66 %.  
Inside view adjustments:  
• Trading screens showing 3–5 bp higher quotes tilt the near-term drift slightly upward.  
• Upcoming 24 Feb auction could price 0–5 bp above the last one if money-fund demand eases (Treasury cash balance rising).  
Net: raise the centre by +1 bp and widen the right tail by +2 bp while keeping the left tail nearly unchanged.

Distribution calibration
We translate the above into the following strictly increasing percentiles (units = Percent):

Percentile 10 (heavy demand shock, flight-to-safety): 3.50  
Percentile 20: 3.56  
Percentile 40: 3.62  
Percentile 60: 3.67  
Percentile 80: 3.73  
Percentile 90 (liquidity pull-back, auction tail): 3.81

Checklist:
1. Target variable: DTB4WK value (%) for 25 Feb 2026 (or nearest prior business day).  
2. Outside-view base rate stated and used.  
3. Consistency check – implied median ≈ (3.62+3.67)/2 = 3.645 %; mean ≈ 3.66 %.  Matches rationale.  
4. Key evidence: a) FRED flat-line at 3.64 %, b) 13 Feb auction 3.63 %, c) no Fed meeting before 25 Feb, d) futures price negligible policy change, e) trading-screen quote 3.69 %.  
5. Blind-spot: sudden funding-market stress (e.g., GSIB balance-sheet shock) that spikes bill yields >15 bp in a day – would push outcome above my 90th percentile.  
6. Status-quo bias checked – distribution still centred very close to latest print.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing; units = %; within open bounds.
