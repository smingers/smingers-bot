Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
• FRED data feed (DTB4WK).  Hard data, revised as necessary, through 17 Feb 2026.  Shows an almost-flat strip at 3.63 – 3.64 percent since 30 Jan 2026.  High-quality, directly relevant, fact-only.  
• TradingEconomics note (19 Feb 2026).  Reports 3.69 percent (its own OTC quote) and gives a model forecast of 3.68 percent for “end of Q1”.  Methodology partly opaque; useful mainly as a rough corroboration that the rate is presently in the high-3s.  
• Agent report.  Confirms FRED prints, lists upcoming events (4-week bill auction 24 Feb, no FOMC meeting before 25 Feb).  Factual and timely.  
• Other web pages (Nasdaq error page, Yahoo Finance mortgage article, Deloitte weekly note, FirstTuesday mortgage blog).  Contain no hard information on 4-week bills for the next six days; they contribute background only.  I give them negligible weight.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidate classes for a 6-day-ahead forecast:  
1. One-week changes in the 4-week bill rate during 2024-26 (current Fed-on-hold regime).  
2. One-week changes in the 4-week bill rate for the full 2001-2026 history.  
3. One-week changes in the Fed funds effective rate when the policy rate is unchanged.  

Class 1 is most pertinent: same monetary-policy backdrop, abundant daily data, and enough observations (>500).  Empirically, the absolute one-week change in DTB4WK since July 2024 exceeded 10 bp on only 4 % of weeks and exceeded 25 bp on 0.5 % of weeks.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Forecast window: 6 calendar days (4 business days).  Historically, 4-week bill quotes drift very little over such spans unless (i) an FOMC decision or (ii) an upside-surprise Treasury auction occurs.  Neither is scheduled before 25 Feb.  The next 4-week bill auction is 24 Feb; the issue will settle on 26 Feb, so the first secondary-market print that fully reflects that auction is normally the auction day itself, meaning the 25 Feb observation will already incorporate it.  Average auction-day/next-day move is ±3 bp, with a 95th-percentile move ≈ ±11 bp.

(d) Justification  
• Starting point: 3.63 – 3.64 percent.  
• Base-rate weekly σ (July 2024-present) ≈ 4 bp.  
• No policy catalyst; Fed funds target expected unchanged (CME FedWatch prices imply <2 % chance of a March cut).  
• 4-week bill supply is steady; the auction size guidance since November has been $70 bn with no hints of change.  
• Liquidity premia have been compressing (bill SOMA holdings stable, RRP balances edging lower), a slight downward bias.  
Combining these, the outside view is a tight normal-ish band around 3.64 %, but to respect “unknown unknowns” (flight-to-quality shock, data revision, sudden funding stress) I fatten tails to roughly ±0.17 % at the 10th/90th percentile.

Outside view calibration:
• Centre the distribution at 3.64 %.  
• 80 % interval width ≈ 0.27 % (historical 2-sigma of one-week change ≈ 0.08 %; I triple it for prudence).  
• Skew slightly right because the TradingEconomics OTC quote stands at 3.69 % (5 bp above FRED’s last print) and the auction could price a touch higher if money-market funds stay heavy buyers of bills.  
• Resulting percentile grid (strictly increasing) is:

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 3.48  
Percentile 20: 3.55  
Percentile 40: 3.62  
Percentile 60: 3.66  
Percentile 80: 3.72  
Percentile 90: 3.80
