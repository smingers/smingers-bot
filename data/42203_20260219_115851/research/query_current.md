Analysis:
To estimate the 4-week T-bill secondary-market discount rate on 2026-02-25 I need very up-to-date information on:
• Today’s and yesterday’s 4-week/one-month bill yields from trading desks, the H.15 release, and Treasury auctions.  
• Short-term drivers over the next few days: Treasury cash-balance management and auction schedule (e.g., the Monday 4-week bill auction), Fed policy expectations, money-market liquidity conditions, and any flight-to-quality headlines.  
Current news stories and data posts using phrases like “4-week Treasury bill”, “one-month T-bill yield”, “Treasury bill auction results”, or directly referencing the FRED code DTB4WK are therefore most relevant.
