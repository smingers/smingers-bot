Analysis:
To estimate the 4-week Treasury bill rate on 2026-02-25 I first need a clear view of where the series has been lately and how it normally behaves around Federal Reserve meetings, debt-ceiling episodes, and month-end bill settlements.  Key historical context therefore includes:  
• The exact daily path of the DTB4WK series over the last several months, especially since the December 2025 FOMC meeting.  
• News or policy developments that could move very-short-term yields between now (2026-02-19) and the target date (e.g., expectations for the March 18 FOMC meeting, Treasury cash-management bill announcements, and money-market fund demand).  
• Current market commentary and forecasts specifically mentioning the 4-week bill or front-end yields.  
Combining these strands will give an “outside view” baseline (recent data distribution) and an “inside view” (event-driven adjustments).
