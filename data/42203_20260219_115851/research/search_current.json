This follows a 39 basis point rise in the previous auction on January 26, resulting in a cumulative increase of nearly 60 basis points over two auctions. The 12-month T-bill yield now exceeds the policy rate, signaling sustained high borrowing costs. The one-month yield fell by 4 basis points to 10.15%, while the three-month and six-month yields rose by 9 and 12 basis points to 10.28% and 10.44%, respectively. Total bids amounted to Rs1.265 trillion, with the government accepting Rs319.8 billion in competitive bids and Rs357.5 billion in non-competitive bids, totaling Rs677.3 billion in borrowing. Analysts warn that higher yields will increase the government\u2019s debt-servicing burden, with interest payments projected at Rs8 trillion\u2014accounting for the largest share of federal expenditure in the current fiscal year. While higher yields may attract foreign investors\u2014evidenced by $176 million in January inflows\u201468% of foreign investment returned during the first seven months (July\u2013January) of the fiscal year, indicating weak overall capital inflow. Market expectations now suggest the policy rate may remain unchanged for the remainder of the fiscal year, despite prior speculation of a 100 basis point cut before the previous auction.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 02:35 AM\nSource:[Dawn](https://www.dawn.com/news/1974303)\n\n**Treasury Bill Issuance Drives Bitcoin Price Action, New Keyrock Report Finds**\nA new report by Keyrock, a cryptocurrency investment and market-making firm, reveals that U.S. Treasury bill issuance is the primary liquidity metric influencing Bitcoin (BTC) prices, not Federal Reserve policy or other central bank balance sheets. The study finds that a 1% change in global liquidity levels correlates with a 7.6% change in BTC prices within the following commercial quarter. Treasury bill issuance has an approximately 80% correlation with BTC prices since 2021 and anticipates BTC price movements by about eight months. According to Amir Hajian, Keyrock\u2019s researcher, increased Treasury bill issuance finances government spending that flows into the real economy and ultimately into risk assets like Bitcoin; conversely, declining or negative issuance reduces fiscal momentum. Historically, net Treasury bill issuance has shown a statistically predictive relationship with Bitcoin returns. However, institutional investors and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have reduced Bitcoin\u2019s sensitivity to liquidity conditions by about 23%. The report contradicts the widely held belief that Federal Reserve interest rate policy is the main driver of liquidity impacting risk assets and forecasts that global liquidity will drive BTC prices through late 2026 and early 2027. Keyrock identifies a 'turning point' in global liquidity, noting that $38 trillion in U.S. national debt will mature within the next four years, requiring refinancing at higher interest rates, much of which was previously issued at near-zero rates. The report projects that Treasury bill issuance will remain between $600 billion and $800 billion annually through 2028.

The report states that every 1% change in global liquidity impacts BTC's price by 7.6% in the following business quarter. Treasury bill issuance has an 80% correlation with BTC prices since 2021 and leads BTC price movements by approximately eight months. Keyrock researcher Amir Hajian explained that rising Treasury bill issuance finances government spending that flows into the real economy and eventually into risk assets like Bitcoin, while falling or negative issuance reduces this fiscal tailwind. The report notes that institutional investors and exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have reduced Bitcoin's sensitivity to liquidity by about 23%. The analysis challenges the common belief that Fed policy is the main liquidity driver for risk assets. Global liquidity is at an 'inflection' point, with $38 trillion of US national debt maturing over the next four years, necessitating refinancing at higher interest rates. The US Treasury is projected to ramp up T-bill issuance to $600 billion to $800 billion annually through 2028, which Keyrock forecasts will impact BTC prices in late 2026 and early 2027.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 06:10 PM\nSource:[Cointelegraph](https://cointelegraph.com/news/treasury-bills-primary-driver-bitcoin-price)\n\n**Government raises P107 billion from Treasury bond auction**\nThe Bureau of the Treasury (BTr) raised P107.07 billion from its 10-year Treasury bond auction on February 18, 2026, despite offering P300 billion, due to a yield cap at acceptable levels. Total tenders reached P328.47 billion\u2014over three times the offered amount\u2014yet P221.39 billion was rejected. The bonds, maturing in 2036, carry a 5.925% coupon rate, with an average yield of 5.893%, a 9.2 basis point decline from the previous auction\u2019s 5.985%. National Treasurer Sharon Almanza emphasized that even small yield differences matter, as they significantly impact long-term borrowing costs. She attributed strong demand to ample liquidity from recently matured bonds and expectations of a 25-basis-point rate cut by the Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP). RCBC economist Michael Ricafort noted that the surge in bids\u2014P328.47 billion compared to P72.67 billion in January\u2014was driven by investors locking in returns ahead of the anticipated rate cut. He also cited the recent maturity of P232.8 billion in seven-year bonds on February 14 as a key liquidity boost.

The system began implementation on Sunday, with initial operations underway even though full integration between brokerage firms and mobile applications (API) has not yet been completed. Azam emphasized that completing this integration will facilitate individual trading via smartphones and boost market activity. He explained that market efficiency and liquidity in the secondary market will depend on the dynamics of bids and offers, and that increased participation and activity under the new system will reduce bid-ask spreads and improve overall liquidity. He also noted that secondary market activity directly supports the primary market by linking the two, aiding in the success of new government issuances. Azam acknowledged that fluctuating interest rates are normal and affect treasury bill and bond prices, highlighting the inverse relationship between interest rates and the value of existing bonds in the secondary market. Regarding government offerings in 2026, Azam confirmed a plan to list approximately 20 government-owned companies on the Egyptian Exchange, pending completion of necessary procedures for a smooth rollout.\nOriginal language: ar\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 06:42 PM\nSource:[\u0635\u062f\u0649 \u0627\u0644\u0628\u0644\u062f](https://www.elbalad.news/6874036)\n\n**Weekly Treasury Simulation: 3-Month Bill 3.68% Today, 1%-2% Range In 30 Months**\nOn February 17, 2026, the 3-month Treasury bill rate was reported at 3.68%, according to a weekly Treasury simulation analysis by Dr. Donald R. van Deventer, founder of Kamakura Corporation and co-head of the Center for Applied Quantitative Finance at SAS Institute Inc. The analysis, based on Prof. Robert Jarrow's framework, highlights that forward rates include a risk premium beyond market expectations for future 3-month rates.

The yield traded at a modest 25 basis point premium above fair value, maintaining near-neutral pricing for five consecutive months. This equilibrium resulted from a rising fair value estimate combined with a declining 10-year yield since October 2023, narrowing the spread to near-neutral levels.

The market rate premium over fair value was 25 basis points in January\u2014up slightly from December and the highest in five months\u2014but remained close to fair value, indicating a recent convergence between market rates and theoretical estimates. Historically, deviations from fair value have shown quasi-random behavior around zero, suggesting mean reversion when spreads widen significantly. This pattern was evident in October 2023, when the spread reached a 95th percentile level since 1980, signaling a peak. More than two years later, the spread has narrowed sharply due to a rising fair-value estimate and a decline in the 10-year yield, which closed at 4.04% on February 13, 2026\u2014nearly one percentage point below the 5% peak observed in October 2023.

The rally followed a strong finish to the prior week, fueled by softer U.S. inflation data and equity market deleveraging by quantitative funds. Prashant Newnaha of TD Securities noted that 4.0% on the 10-year Treasury is a critical technical level, with a potential sharp rally if breached. Traders are monitoring upcoming data, including the ADP private payrolls report at 8:15 EST, and the January Fed meeting minutes for clues on rate cut timing. Goldman Sachs\u2019 Kamakshya Trivedi observed a generally softening labor market trend, though recent data has been encouraging. Conversely, Benoit Anne of MFS Investment Management warned that a robust U.S. economy could risk overheating, potentially leading to a 'significant correction' if inflation pressures re-emerge, which could unwind current rate cut expectations priced at 63 basis points for 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 11:52 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The tender attracted NT$48.3 billion in bids, up from NT$44.2 billion in the prior auction, with the bid-to-cover ratio rising from 1.26 to 1.38. The weighted average winning discount rate was 1.233%. Bank participation dominated, with banks securing 98% of the issuance\u2014NT$343 billion\u2014while securities and insurance firms received nothing, and the brokerage sector captured 2% (NT$7 billion). Bank officials attributed the strong demand to a gradual global easing cycle, expected\u5bbd\u677e funding conditions in 2026, and a high level of liquidity in the domestic market, especially around the New Year and Lunar New Year periods. Despite the current high-interest-rate environment compared to pre-2022 levels, market liquidity remains relatively tight, and long-term instruments like 273-day Treasury bills are still primarily sought by banks due to limited alternative investment outlets. Although long-term Treasury bill demand is not yet strong, it is expected to rise significantly after the Central Bank implements rate cuts. The 273-day Treasury bill is issued annually, while the 364-day deposit notes are monitored monthly for broader market trends.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 22, 2026 11:02 PM\nSource:[\u5de5\u5546\u6642\u5831](https://www.ctee.com.tw/news/20260123700173-430301)\n\n**US 4-Week Bill Auction Sees Slight Increase a... | Forex News 2026.01.15 (en)**\nThe U.S. Treasury's 4-week bill auction on January 15, 2026, concluded with a yield rate of 3.595%, a slight increase from the previous rate of 3.550%.

This modest uptick follows a gradual upward trend in yields across recent auctions, reflecting subtle shifts in investor sentiment amid evolving economic conditions. The change, though small, indicates market responsiveness to macroeconomic indicators, including monetary policy and inflation forecasts. As 4-week bills are considered low-risk securities, the yield increase signals nuanced adjustments in investor expectations for the 2026 fiscal year.

This marginal rise reflects subtle shifts in the money market as the fiscal year concludes. Treasury bills, valued for their liquidity and safety, remain a key short-term investment for institutional and individual investors. The yield change is interpreted as a potential indicator of evolving economic conditions and monetary policy influences on government borrowing costs. Market participants closely monitor these auctions for insights into interest rate expectations and broader economic sentiment, particularly as the U.S. fiscal year ends and anticipation builds for future Federal Reserve actions and economic strategy adjustments in the coming year.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 26, 2025 04:47 PM\nSource:[InstaForex](https://www.instaforex.com/forex-news/2818518)\n\n**Money market report for the week ended November 13, 2025**\nOn November 11, 2025, the European Central Bank (ECB) conducted a seven-day Main Refinancing Operation (MRO) with total bids of \u20ac9,847.50 million, \u20ac706 million below the previous week, and allotted in full at a fixed rate of 2.15%, consistent with ECB policy.
