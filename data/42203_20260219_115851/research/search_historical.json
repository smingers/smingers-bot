Starting in 1999, the Fed increased rates, peaking at 6.5% in 2000, followed by a recession in early 2001\n- **Current Fed stance:** The Fed recently indicated an intention to keep the short-term interest rate steady, given persistent above-target inflation and strong economic growth\n- **Futures markets:** Implied probabilities of Fed policy moves didn't change much following the jobs report mentioned\n\n### Japan:\n- **Government debt:** Japan's government debt as a share of GDP is higher than any other major developed economy\n- **Consumption tax:** Prime Minister Takaichi proposed temporarily eliminating the 8% consumption tax on food\n- **Market reaction:** Since the election, the yen rose in value significantly, bond yields have fallen, and equity prices have risen sharply\n\n### Europe:\n- **Germany Q4 GDP:** Real GDP up only 0.4% year-over-year, but up 0.3% quarter-over-quarter\n- **Other eurozone countries Q4 year-over-year growth:** France 1.1%, Italy 0.8%, Spain 2.6%, Netherlands 1.8%, Belgium 1.1%, Portugal 1.9%\n- **Non-eurozone EU countries:** Poland 3.6%, Czechia 2.4%, Bulgaria 2.9%, Hungary 0.5%\n- **December eurozone exports:** Up 3.4% to non-eurozone countries, up 6.7% within eurozone\n- **December eurozone imports:** Up 4.2% from outside the eurozone\n- **EU exports by destination (December):** Down 12.6% to US, up 11.5% to China, up 8.4% to UK, up 14.5% to India, up 20.3% to Switzerland, down 2% to Japan\n- **EU imports:** Up 1.6% from US, up 10.2% from China\n\n## Named Source Opinions:\n\n**Kevin Warsh (Fed Chair nominee):** Wants to cut the benchmark rate because AI is likely to fuel strong productivity growth, which would be disinflationary\n\n**US Treasury Secretary Bessent:** Supports the Warsh argument that the current moment resembles the 1990s\n\n**Jason Furman (Harvard economist, former Obama-era economic adviser, writing in Financial Times):** Acknowledges that labor productivity growth can reduce inflation by enabling businesses to boost wages without increasing prices. However, notes that productivity growth also leads to faster economic growth, potentially driving increased consumer spending and business investment, creating capacity constraints and causing prices to rise. Suggests faster productivity growth could imply a higher neutral real interest rate\n\n**Prime Minister Takaichi (Japan):** Stated \"we must pull Japan out of excessively tight fiscal policy and a lack of investment\" and that \"responsible, proactive fiscal policy is at the core of the... policy transition\"\n\n## Analysis Points (from article):\n\n- The article argues that even if Warsh's productivity argument is correct, it might be too early to discuss cutting interest rates due to productivity gains, as productivity gains in recent quarters occurred only in the technology sector, with most other sectors yet to see productivity gains or widespread AI adoption\n- An early reduction in the Fed's benchmark interest rate could lead to higher inflation, according to the article's analysis\n- The article notes that the jobs report \"probably won't change these viewpoints\" regarding Fed deliberations\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://journal.firsttuesday.us/current-market-rates/3832/\">\n# Summary of Article: \"Trending mortgage rates\"\n\n**Source:** Journal.firsttuesday.us  \n**Date:** August 27, 2021 (though article contains data from February 2026)  \n**Author:** ft Editorial Staff\n\n## Key Facts and Statistics:\n\n1. **4-Week Treasury Bill Rate (DTB4WK):** The article does not directly mention the 4-week Treasury bill rate.\n\n2. **Mortgage Rates (as of week ending February 12, 2026):**\n   - 30-year fixed rate mortgage (FRM): 6.09%\n   - 15-year FRM: 5.44%\n   - Adjustable rate mortgages (ARMs): 5.48% (as of February 13, 2026)\n\n3. **10-Year Treasury Note Rate:** 4.06% (as of February 13, 2026)\n\n4. **Spread between 10-year T-Note and 30-year FRM:** 2.03% (currently), with historical normal spread at 1.5%\n\n5. **ARM-to-FRM spread:** 61 basis points (0.61 percentage points) lower than 30-year FRM\n\n## Opinions and Projections:\n\n**From the article (source not specifically attributed):**\n- FRM rates expected to \"gradually work their way lower in 2026\" when the Fed completes stabilizing job growth and consumer inflation\n- Long-term upward trend in mortgage rates expected to continue, having commenced in 2013, likely running for \"around two more decades\"\n- Real estate pricing conditions producing \"continuing industry-wide reduction of fee-earning transactions likely into 2028\"\n- Property pricing bottom expected to be established over \"around 30 months\"\n- Improved market pricing conditions for property acquisition expected \"likely by 2028\"\n\n**Note:** The article publication date appears inconsistent (listed as August 27, 2021, but contains February 2026 data), suggesting possible data extraction issues or the article being updated with future projections.\n</Summary>\n\n<Agent_report>\nQuery: Provide daily DTB4WK values from 2025-11-01 through 2026-02-18 and compute 7-day and 30-day moving averages; list any dates with moves \u226525 bp; include any Fed announcements or Treasury bill auctions scheduled between 2026-02-19 and 2026-02-25 that could affect the rate\n1. Daily DTB4WK observations now available  \nThe FRED site shows only twelve daily prints for the window 2026-01-30 through 2026-02-17 (all either 3.63 % or 3.64 %) (FRED \u2013 DTB4WK).  No data for the earlier span 2025-11-01 to 2026-01-29 are displayed in the material retrieved.  Consequently  \n\u2022 a complete table of daily values,  \n\u2022 7-day and 30-day simple moving averages, and  \n\u2022 a definitive screen for any \u2265 25-bp one-day moves  \ncannot yet be produced.  With the partial run in hand every day-to-day change is \u00b10.01 pp (1 bp), far below the 25-bp threshold, so nothing qualifies among the dates visible so far.\n\n2. Evidence of large single-day moves (\u2265 25 bp)  \nBecause the only quoted levels are 3.63 % and 3.64 %, no outsized jumps appear in the subset examined.  A final conclusion requires the still-missing observations for November 2025 through January 2026.\n\n3. Fed policy events that could influence the 4-week bill rate, 19 Feb\u201325 Feb 2026  \n\u2022 18 Feb 2026 \u2013 Release of the minutes from the 27-28 Jan FOMC meeting.  These minutes (Federalreserve.gov, reported by CNBC, 18 Feb 2026) are the most recent insight into Committee thinking and will remain the key monetary-policy reference over the following week.  \n\u2022 No scheduled FOMC meeting, Summary-of-Economic-Projections update, or Chair press conference falls between 19 Feb and 25 Feb, and the next FOMC meeting is not until 17-18 Mar 2026; the Fed is therefore outside a blackout period, but no new policy announcement is slated for the week in question.\n\n4. Treasury bill auctions scheduled 19 Feb \u2013 25 Feb 2026  \nTreasury\u2019s standard bill cycle is: announcement Thursday \u2192 auction Tuesday \u2192 settlement Thursday.  The official \u201cAnnouncements, Data & Results\u201d feed on TreasuryDirect shows precisely that pattern for the third and fourth weeks of February 2026.  Extracts from the XML feed list (TreasuryDirect \u2013 Auctions):  \n\u2022 Thursday 19 Feb 2026 \u2013 Announcement of the 4-week bill and other bills to be auctioned the following Tuesday (CUSIP for the 4-week bill will be released in that announcement).  \n\u2022 Tuesday 24 Feb 2026 \u2013 Auction of the 4-week bill (along with the regular 8-week bill).  \n\u2022 Thursday 26 Feb 2026 \u2013 Issue/settlement date for those bills (settlements customarily occur two business days after the auction).  \nBecause DTB4WK measures the secondary-market discount rate, the size of the non-competitive bid, bid-to-cover ratio, and high discount rate at the 24 Feb auction are the most direct scheduled influences on the series observation for 25 Feb 2026.\n\n5. Information still missing to fulfil the original request  \n\u2022 Full daily DTB4WK history from 1 Nov 2025 through 29 Jan 2026 (plus 18 Feb 2026).  \n\u2022 Once that file is obtained, calculation of 7-day and 30-day averages and confirmation that no \u2265 25 bp moves occurred.  \n\u2022 The Treasury\u2019s PDF announcement dated 19 Feb 2026 that will assign a CUSIP and offering size to the 4-week bill auctioned on 24 Feb; publication of that PDF will allow the auction schedule stated above to be formally cited.\n\nWith those items retrieved the numerical table and the event list required by the original query can be completed.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"DTB4WK\" query=\"DTB4WK\">\nFRED Economic Data: 4-Week Treasury Bill Secondary Market Rate, Discount Basis\nSeries ID: DTB4WK\nUnits: Percent\nFrequency: Daily\nLatest observation: 3.63 (2026-02-17)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=4.04, min=3.50, max=4.30\n- 5-year: mean=3.24, min=0.00, max=5.78\n- 10-year: mean=2.15, min=-0.04, max=5.78\n- All-time: mean=1.63, min=-0.04, max=5.78 (since 2001-07-31)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: +0.03 (+0.8%)\n- 3-month change: -0.24 (-6.2%)\n- 6-month change: -0.67 (-15.6%)\n- Year-over-year: 3.63 vs 4.26 (-14.8%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Daily):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-30,3.63\n2026-02-02,3.63\n2026-02-03,3.63\n2026-02-04,3.63\n2026-02-05,3.64\n2026-02-06,3.63\n2026-02-09,3.63\n2026-02-10,3.63\n2026-02-11,3.63\n2026-02-12,3.64\n2026-02-13,3.63\n2026-02-17,3.63\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
