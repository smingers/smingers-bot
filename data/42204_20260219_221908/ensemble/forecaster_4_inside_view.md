Analysis:
(a) Source analysis  
1. StockInvest.us (19 Feb 2026, algorithmic technical note).  Factual: last close $124.90, moving-average levels, volume.  Opinion: “general buy signal”.  Quality: medium – data good, model opinion weak.  
2. Ticker Nerd (early Feb 2026, analyst aggregate).  Factual: 36-analyst median target $122, rating mix.  Opinion: “neutral consensus”.  Quality: medium – cites named brokers.  
3. MarketBeat Investor-Day recap (11 Feb 2026).  Factual: management claims on margins, share, capex.  Opinion: management optimism.  Quality: high for facts that are in the slide deck; forward claims are self-interested.  
4. Q4-25 earnings articles (27 Jan 2026, Quiver/TradingView/Morningstar).  Factual: EPS $1.06, revenue miss, year-on-year declines.  Opinion: “broadly disappointing”.  Quality: high for GAAP numbers; moderate for tone.  
5. GuruFocus SWOT (19 Feb 2026).  Mostly descriptive of 10-K; low value for 1-week horizon.  
6. General market wires (17-18 Feb 2026).  Confirm S&P rising, tech led.  High quality for index closes.  

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong: none (no hard catalyst inside window).  
Moderate positive:  
• U.S. equity drift – indices up, no scheduled firm shock.  
• Mean-reversion tendency after three down days and option-expiry (20 Feb).  
Moderate negative:  
• Recent downward momentum (8 of last 10 days red; MACD sell).  
• Consensus price targets sit below current price ($122 vs $124.9).  
Weak positive:  Support at 121.8 implies limited further room down before technical buyers; closing above 124.9 requires <2% lift.  
Weak negative:  Lingering post-earnings sentiment, insider sales in January.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution in six trading sessions (≈8 calendar days).  Halving window to 3 sessions would increase noise → probability drifts toward 50%.  Doubling to 12 sessions would let macro drift matter more → slight tilt upward (≈+1-2 ppt).

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
Base rate (outside view): 52.6 % for an S&P-500 stock to finish the next week higher.  
Adjustments:  
–2 ppt recent negative momentum.  
–1.5 ppt analyst targets below spot.  
+1.5 ppt mean-reversion/option-expiry.  
+1 ppt broad-market strength.  
+0.5 ppt low hurdle (needs <+1% rise).  
Net: +0 ppt (rounding).  Inside view ≈52 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that in 52 of 100 similar weeks PCAR’s 27 Feb 2026 close would exceed its 19 Feb 2026 close.

Checklist:
1. “Will PCAR close higher on 27 Feb than on 19 Feb?” (6 trading-day window, Yahoo Finance close).  
2. Outside base 52.6 % → final 52 %.  
3. Consistency: “52 of 100 times, PCAR ends higher.” ✔  
4. Key evidence (15-20 words each)  
   • Short-horizon equity drift modestly positive.  
   • Stock down 3 straight days ⇒ mild bounce tendency.  
   • MACD/short MA sell signals – negative momentum.  
   • Analyst median target $122 below spot — sentiment soft.  
   • No firm-specific catalyst; macro indices trending up.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden macro shock (e.g., freight recession headline or Fed hawkish surprise) causing sector drop.  Would swing probability <40 %.  
6. Status-quo outcome (little price change) already near coin-flip; slight upward edge retained.

Probability: 52%
