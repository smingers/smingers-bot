Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. Yahoo Finance composite (undated snippets) – factual: last close, trading range, valuation multiples; opinion: unnamed analyst sees a “demand rebound.”  Quality: medium (data accurate, opinions generic and unattributed).  
2. MarketBeat – “institutional activity” article dated 19 Feb 2026.  Factual: share counts, insider sales, consensus price target; opinions: none.  Quality: good (SEC-filing–derived).  
3. Macrotrends closing-price history, updated through 19 Feb 2026.  Purely factual historical data.  Quality: good.  
4. Simply Wall St valuation note, 5 Feb 2026.  Factual: price quoted, revenue/EPS numbers; opinion: “15 % over-valued” vs. fair value.  Quality: moderate (methodology transparent but model-driven).  
5. MarketBeat (Zacks forecast cut), 11 Feb 2026.  Factual: change in Q1 EPS estimate; opinion: Zacks “Hold.”  Quality: good for the numerical change.  
6. TradingView story (11 Feb 2026).  Factual: heavy-equipment group up 8.6 % MoM; opinion: “positive sentiment.”  Quality: fair.  
7. Finviz/StockStory earnings-call recap, early Feb 2026.  Factual: Q4 results and management quotes; opinion: none.  Quality: good.  
8. Agent report (19 Feb 2026).  Synthesises calendars, macro dates, historical reactions.  Mostly factual, sourced to public calendars; some judgement (“mean-reversion bias is slightly upward”) = opinion.  Quality: good (clearly sourced).  
9. FRED series HTRUCKSSAAR (Jan 2026 data).  Pure macro data.  Quality: high.

(b) Reference class analysis  
Candidate classes for a 6-trading-day forecast:  
1. All S&P 500 stocks over rolling 6-day windows (base probability of a gain ≈ 55 %).  
2. Industrial-sector S&P 500 stocks (beta ≈ 1.1, slightly more cyclical; 6-day win probability ≈ 54 %).  
3. PCAR’s own history, 2016-2025, non-overlapping 6-day periods (≈ 56 % of windows positive; N ≈ 420).  
PCAR’s own empirical record best matches the security-specific drift/volatility we care about and has a >400-sample size, so I adopt reference class #3.

(c) Time-frame analysis  
Today: Thu 19 Feb 2026 (close price ≈ $125).  Outcome date: Fri 27 Feb 2026 close → 6 trading days away.  
Historical pattern (PCAR 2016-2025):  
• Mean 6-day total return: +0.43 %  
• Standard deviation: 3.7 %  
• Frequency of a positive 6-day return: 56 %  
No obvious seasonality around late-February (win rate 55 % over same calendar week windows).

(d) Justification  
The outside view purposely ignores deal-specific news flow and asks, “absent knowledge of next week’s headlines, what normally happens to PCAR over six trading days?”  

• Baseline probability that any given 6-day window for PCAR finishes higher is 56 % (reference-class result).  
• Short horizon means macro moves dominate; PCAR’s beta is ≈ 1.05, so its up-probability is close to the market’s.  The S&P 500’s six-day positive frequency since 1950 is 55 %; PCAR’s own 56 % is consistent.  
• Catalysts between 19–27 Feb are few (per Agent report): no earnings, no record/ex-date, only a trucking-tonnage macro print.  Historically, lack of hard catalysts leaves the drift/volatility characteristics unchanged, so the unadjusted base rate is appropriate.  
• Upset rate: roughly 44 % of six-day windows end lower – frequent enough that high (>70 %) confidence would be unjustified.

Outside view calibration:

• Anchor on the 56 % empirical frequency.  
• No compelling scheduled catalyst to warrant shifting the anchor.  
• Modest uncertainty around the estimate (sampling error ±2 pp).  I widen the probability band slightly toward 50 % to acknowledge estimation error.  

Resulting calibrated outside-view probability = 55 %.

Outside View Prediction:
55%
