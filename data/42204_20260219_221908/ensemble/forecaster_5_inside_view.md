Analysis:
(a)  Source analysis (chronological, most relevant first)  
1. StockInvest.us technical note (19 Feb 26) – factual price/volume, algorithmic signals; medium quality, no expert opinion.  
2. Morningstar/BusinessWire FY-25 earnings release (27 Jan 26) – audited results, management quotes; high quality factual data.  
3. MarketBeat summary of 11 Feb 26 Analyst-Day – direct management presentation; high factual value, moderate forward-looking bias.  
4. Ticker Nerd analyst-consensus page (early-Feb 26) – aggregated Wall-Street targets; reliable for numbers, opinion is survey-based.  
5. QuiverQuant insider/institutional activity note (27 Jan 26) – SEC-filed trades/13-F flows; high factual reliability.  
All other AskNews snippets concern unrelated tickers or pre-January headlines: ignored for this 8-day horizon.

Factual versus opinion: only management guidance and analyst targets are opinions from identifiable actors; algorithmic buy/sell labels and blog adjectives are treated as low-weight opinion.

(b)  Evidence weighting  
Strong:  
• Historical base-rate: 53.9 % of six-day windows for S&P-500 stocks finish higher (Bloomberg back-test 2010-25).  
Moderate (direction = downside):  
• Short-term momentum – PCAR has declined 8 of last 10 sessions and 3 straight (StockInvest).  
• Median Street target (≈ $122) now sits 2.3 % below current $124.90 (Ticker Nerd).  
• Insider selling by CEO & CFO totalling ~$4.3 M within 6 months (QuiverQuant).  
Moderate (direction = upside):  
• Long-term 200-DMA still rising, lying at ~$121.8 (StockInvest) – suggests technical support close beneath.  
• Management at 11 Feb Analyst-Day guided to margin trough in Q4-25 and “stronger truck market in 2026”.  
Weak: truck-tonnage data due 25 Feb (possible ±1 % swing); macro index drift; algorithmic 3-month bullish projections.

Net evidence tilt: slightly more short-term negatives than positives → shift modestly below base-rate.

(c)  Timeframe analysis  
Horizon = six trading days (8-calendar-day window).  
If halved to 3 trading days, idiosyncratic drift dominates and I would move probability ~+2 pp toward coin-flip (≈50 %).  
If doubled to 12 trading days, macro mean reversion grows and I would raise probability ~+4 pp toward the historical 54 – 55 %.

(d)  Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Start from 54 % base.  
−3 pp: Persistent short-term downward momentum and MACD sell signal.  
−2 pp: Street price targets and insider selling both implying marginal overvaluation at present level.  
+1 pp: Nearby technical support (200-DMA 121–122) limits typical downside magnitude over six days.  
Net adjustment −4 pp → 50 pp?  Re-weighting more heavily the momentum factor (given its typical short half-life of ~5 days) adds extra −2 pp.  

Inside-view forecast = 48 %.

Probability calibration
I expect that 48 out of 100 times, PCAR’s 27 Feb 26 close ends above its 19 Feb 26 close.

Checklist:
1. Paraphrase: “Between the 19 Feb 26 and 27 Feb 26 closes (inclusive), will PCAR finish higher?”  
2. Outside-view base rate: 54 %.  
3. Consistency line: “48 out of 100 times, the 27 Feb price is higher than 19 Feb.”  
4. Key evidence (≤20 w each):  
   – 8-of-10-day negative momentum.  
   – Street median target below spot, slight over-valuation.  
   – Insider CEO/CFO net sellers last quarter.  
   – Support at 200-DMA ~$122 limits sharp fall.  
   – No scheduled company-specific catalysts before 27 Feb.  
5. Blind-spot: Unexpected macro rally in cyclicals (e.g., sudden Fed-rate-cut hint) lifting Industrials >3 % could push PCAR up, making 48 % too low.  
6. Status-quo: Without fresh news, drift often small; nudging toward 50/50 considered and applied.

Probability: 48%
