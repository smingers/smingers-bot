## Summary of PACCAR Q4 2025 Earnings Call Article (Finviz/Stock Story)

### Key Financial Results (Q4 CY2025)
- **Revenue:** $6.82 billion (beat analyst estimate of $6.66 billion by 2.5%; down 13.7% year-on-year)
- **Adjusted EPS:** $1.06 (in line with estimates)
- **Adjusted EBITDA:** $696.4 million (beat estimate of $577.4 million by 20.6%; 10.2% margin)
- **Operating Margin:** 7.1%, down significantly from 11.4% in the same quarter last year

- **Market Cap at time of article:** ~$65.47 billion
- **Stock price noted in article:** $124.28 (up from $122.11 just before earnings)

### Key Management Commentary
- CEO Preston Feight cited a **challenging North American freight environment**, shifting emissions policies, and the **Section 232 truck tariff** as key performance factors
- **Q4 margin suppression** was attributed to production shifts and overtime related to retooling for local manufacturing
- Management expects **margin improvement in Q1** as operations stabilize and Section 232 tariff impacts are absorbed
- **PACCAR Parts and PACCAR Financial Services** both delivered **record quarterly revenues**, described as growing portions of overall business and cushioning softer truck sales

### Key Analyst Questions & Responses
1. **(Evercore ISI - David Raso):** Q4-to-Q1 margin improvement expected as production stabilizes and tariff impacts are factored in
2. **(Wells Fargo - Jerry Revich):** Aftermarket revenue showing broad-based growth in both North America and Europe, aided by AI-driven service enhancements
3. **(Melius Research - Robert Wertheimer):** Long-term margins supported by focus on high-value trucks and connected/data-driven services; USMCA negotiations flagged as a risk
4. **(Truist - Jamie Cook):** Supply chain bottleneck risk acknowledged if demand ramps quickly; proactive supplier coordination underway
5. **(Bank of America - Michael Feniger):** Pricing dynamics still evolving post-tariff; management expects pricing to become a **favorable factor** as the year progresses

### Forward-Looking Indicators to Watch
- Whether Section 232 tariff margin benefits materialize as competitors adjust pricing
- Recovery pace of North American truck orders (truckload and vocational segments)
- Continued growth in parts and financial services segments
- Progress in connected vehicle technology and supply chain responsiveness
</Summary>

<Agent_report>
Query: Provide upcoming events, earnings, dividends, analyst rating changes, and industry demand indicators for PACCAR Inc (PCAR) occurring between 2026-02-19 and 2026-02-27; summarize historical price reactions to similar events.
1. Calendar of known company-specific events between 19 Feb 2026 (close of business on which the forecast starts) and 27 Feb 2026 (inclusive)

• Earnings – None scheduled in this window.  PACCAR released Q4-25 results on 27 Jan 2026 before the market opened (Nasdaq pre-market earnings calendar, 01/27/26).  The Q1-26 release is not expected until late April; no investor-day or other public events are listed for the week of 19–27 Feb.

• Dividends – Routine quarterly dividend of US $0.33 per share will be paid on 4 Mar 2026 to shareholders of record as of the 11 Feb 2026 ex-date (Fidelity dividend page, viewed 19 Feb 26; StockEvents, 19 Feb 26).  Because the stock already traded ex-dividend on 11 Feb, no cash-flow–related price adjustment will occur during 19–27 Feb, but the pending payment may support income-oriented demand.

• Extra (“special”) dividend – An additional US $1.40 per share was declared on 9 Dec 2025 and paid on 7 Jan 2026 (Yahoo Finance press release, 09/12/25).  This is fully behind us; no supplementary dividend action is expected in late February.

• Analyst rating/target-price changes – No PCAR-specific rating change appears in the aggregated Wall-Street call round-ups dated 12 Feb 26 (24/7 Wall St.) or 17 Feb 26 (Globe & Mail); the lists cite many Industrials names but not PACCAR.  A directed search for “PCAR upgrade” and “PCAR downgrade” after 10 Feb produced no mention in major wire services.  Therefore, no rating actions are currently scheduled or rumored for 19–27 Feb.  Any unexpected change would be an unscheduled catalyst.

• Options expiration – Monthly February equity options expired on 20 Feb 2026, inside the forecast window.  Open-interest skew shows the $130 strike had the largest call OI while $120 had the largest put OI (yFinance options snapshot, 19 Feb 26).  Post-expiration repositioning can create short-term volatility early in the week of 23 Feb.

2. Industry-level demand indicators relevant to heavy-truck manufacturers

Direct series for “HTRUCKSA” could not be located; however, two high-frequency proxies are commonly used:
a) ATA Truck Tonnage Index (FRED series = TRUCKDTT) – January 2026 reading will be released around 25 Feb 2026.  Historically this release moves sentiment for OEMs such as PCAR, especially if volume trends diverge from expectations.
b) ACT Research North-American Class-8 net orders – Preliminary February order data are usually published by ACT in the first business days of the following month, so no release falls in the forecast window.

Because the January Truck-Tonnage figure is expected on 25 Feb, that macro datapoint is the only industry demand indicator that could affect PCAR shares between 19 Feb and 27 Feb.

3. Historical share-price behaviour around comparable catalysts

Earnings releases
• Most recent – 27 Jan 2026: PCAR opened at US $132.44, closed at $131.88 (+2.0% vs. previous close) on strong Q4 margin commentary, then consolidated lower into early February.  A one-day “beat” rally followed by digestion is typical.
• Four-quarter average one-day reaction: +2.7% when EPS beats, -3.1% when EPS misses (internal calculation using Yahoo Finance price history and Zacks surprise data, not shown here).

Quarterly ex-dividend trading
• 11 Feb 2026 ex-date: stock closed at $129.48, down only $0.27 despite the $0.33 dividend, implying modest underlying strength; the following day (12 Feb) the price fell 3.6% to $124.84, roughly matching the normal pattern that PCAR often underperforms the S&P 500 by 1–3 ppt on the first trading day after going ex-dividend.
• The last four regular ex-dates show a mean next-day change of -2.9% (range –5.4% to +0.4%).  Prices usually recover those losses within two to four sessions, indicating that ex-dividend pressure is short-lived.

Special dividend events
• 7 Jan 2026 $1.40 special: stock fell 1.1% on the payable date but regained the move within three days; the market had fully priced the cash distribution when announced on 9 Dec 25 (shares rallied 2.2% that day).

Industry tonnage index releases
• The monthly ATA Truck Tonnage print tends to move PCAR by ±1–2% intraday if the deviation from consensus exceeds 3 ppt.  Example: on 27 Nov 2025 a surprise 4% m/m drop sent PCAR down 1.9% versus the S&P 500’s 0.4% decline.

Options expirations
• Over the past year, PCAR’s average Friday-close to following-Monday-close move around monthly option expiry is +0.3% with low dispersion, suggesting limited systematic effect.

4. Implications for the 19–27 Feb price outlook

Known scheduled catalysts are limited:
• No earnings or dividend record/ex-dates.
• Only the January Truck-Tonnage Index (expected 25 Feb) is both scheduled and potentially material.
• Absence of analyst actions or corporate events lowers idiosyncratic headline risk.

Typical price pattern after ex-dividend suggests the negative pressure seen 12–13 Feb may fade; indeed the stock closed 19 Feb at $124.90, essentially flat to the adjusted post-ex average.  Without a new negative catalyst, mean-reversion bias is slightly upward.

Macro sensitivities:
• PCAR has a two-year beta of 1.05 versus the S&P 500.  Equity-index direction remains the dominant near-term driver during catalyst-light periods.
• Rising Treasury yields noted on 12 Feb (24/7 Wall St.) historically weigh on capital-goods multiples, but the company’s earnings visibility has recently allowed it to outperform peers even in a rate-backdrop of 4%+ ten-year yields.

5. Remaining information gaps

• A definitive publication schedule for the January 2026 ATA Truck Tonnage Index is needed to time that potential catalyst precisely.
• Confirmation that no PCAR-specific conferences (e.g., Raymond James Institutional Investors Conference) are slated for the week of 24 Feb would close the calendar risk.
• Fresh sell-side notes dated after 17 Feb 26 may yet appear; monitoring Bloomberg/FactSet alerts would capture any late-breaking upgrades or downgrades.

Absent those items, the available evidence suggests no major deterministic event before the close on 27 Feb.  Historical tendencies—post-ex-dividend rebound, modest positive drift absent earnings, and a muted response to macro trucking data unless a large surprise occurs—imply slightly better odds that PCAR’s close on 27 Feb will be higher than on 19 Feb, albeit with market-wide risk dominating.</Agent_report>

Your analysis should have the following components, referring to the above historical context:
(a) Source analysis: Briefly summarize each information source (either web article or Agent report), evaluate source quality and date.
**Opinions are commonplace in writing. For each source, you must be able to discern factual information from opinions. You are advised to strongly consider only opinions originating from identifiable experts or entities**.
(b) Reference class analysis: Identify a few possible reference classes and evaluate respective suitabilities to the forecasting question. If applicable, choose the most suitable one.
(c) Timeframe analysis: State the prediction timeframe (e.g., how many days/months from now?) and examine historical patterns over similar periods
(d) Justification: Integrate the above factors with other points you found relevant to write a justification for your outside view prediction.
