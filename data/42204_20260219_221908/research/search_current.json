At 15:25 (Bras\u00edlia time), the stock was down 9.23%, trading at R$ 3.05. On a year-to-date basis, the shares have declined approximately 23%, with a drop of about 20% in February alone. The stock was among the highest in terms of loaned shares, with a 15.41% short interest rate, indicating investor bets on continued declines. Short selling occurs when investors borrow shares, sell them immediately, and aim to repurchase them later at a lower price to return the shares and profit from the difference\u2014this reflects skepticism about the company\u2019s performance. GPA is set to release its financial results on Tuesday, February 24, after market close, with expectations that sales growth will lag behind inflation. In a recent report, JPMorgan described GPA as a premium retailer with strong brand reputation undergoing restructuring focused on deleveraging, returning to fundamentals, expense cuts, and margin improvement. However, despite incorporating continuous profitability improvements into its 2026 projections, the bank still views cash generation and leverage as concerns, even with expected lower interest rates. Revenue trends remain challenging due to pressured consumer demand.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: February 19, 2026 06:41 PM\nSource:[InfoMoney](https://www.infomoney.com.br/mercados/gpa-pcar3-chega-a-cair-mais-de-10-na-sessao-e-acumula-perdas-de-23-em-2026/)\n\n**Loar trades 2.54 percent higher on Thursday 19th of February**\nLoar (LOAR) shares rose 2.54% over a 24-hour period ending at 04:59 PM Central Europe Time on Thursday, February 19, 2026, with the stock trading at approximately USD 67.34.

The company's market valuation was $49.01 billion as of mid-2025. Strengths include market leadership with 30% share in North America's Class 8 segment and 15% in Europe's heavy-duty market, strong brand equity from Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF, a robust dealer network of over 2,200 independent dealers, a resilient parts business with 21 global distribution centers, and a strategically significant financial services segment that holds 51% of total assets. Weaknesses include exposure to economic cycles, sensitivity to commodity price fluctuations (steel, copper, aluminum, petroleum), and high regulatory compliance costs due to stringent environmental and safety standards. Opportunities lie in advancements in zero-emission technologies\u2014battery-electric, hydrogen combustion, and hybrid trucks\u2014supported by partnerships in battery manufacturing, global expansion into emerging markets, and investments in connected truck technologies like the PACCAR Connect fleet management system.

This performance contrasted with gains in major U.S. stock markets: the S&P 500 rose 0.50%, the Dow Jones gained 0.26%, and the Nasdaq advanced 0.78%, driven by resilient U.S. economic data despite the end of the interest rate cut cycle in late 2025. In Brazil, Vale (VALE3) shares dropped 3.57%, dragging down the Ibovespa due to a decline in international iron ore prices. Banking stocks showed mixed results: BBDC4 fell 0.29%, BBAS3 rose 1.53%, SANB11 gained 1.86%, BPAC11 advanced 1.23%, and ITUB4 increased 0.46%.

Crude futures surged: Brent for April closed at $70.35 (+4.35%), and WTI for March at $65.19 (+4.59%), fueled by escalating geopolitical tensions between Russia and Ukraine and the potential for joint military action by Israel and the U.S. in Iran. On the upside, Ra\u00edzen (RAIZ4) led gains with a 6.35% increase, driven by Shell\u2019s proposal to convert 25% of its debt into shares and plans to split the company with Cosan and BTG funds. PetroRec\u00f4ncavo (RECV3) rose 3.59%, while GPA (PCAR3) was the worst performer, falling 4.55%. Externally, the Federal Reserve\u2019s minutes revealed divided views on future monetary policy, with some officials advocating rate cuts, others favoring stability or even hikes if inflation remains sticky. Domestically, the Focus report showed the 2026 IPCA inflation forecast declined for the sixth consecutive week, falling from 3.97% to 3.95%, while the Selic rate projection remained unchanged at 12.25% by year-end.

The S&P 500 index initially dropped 1.5% during the session but recovered to close up 0.5% at 6,843.22. Gains from NVIDIA and Apple offset declines in Microsoft and Oracle.

Tim Ghriskey, senior investment portfolio strategist at Ingalls & Snyder, noted that investors are navigating multiple trends, leading to high market volatility. He added that AI-related investments are likely to regain favor.

Growth is driven by rising demand from key end-use industries, including food and beverages, pharmaceuticals, and personal care. Increasing consumer preference for convenient, safe, and hygienic packaging\u2014particularly in the post-pandemic era\u2014has accelerated adoption of advanced closures such as tamper-evident (TE) and dispensing closures. Sustainability is a major market trend, with manufacturers adopting environmentally friendly materials like polypropylene (PP) and high-density polyethylene (HDPE), and launching closures made from post-consumer recycled (PCR) materials. Companies such as Berry Global and Aptar have introduced PCR-based closures, aligning with circular economy goals. The expanding beverage industry, especially in the Asia-Pacific region, further fuels demand. In pharmaceutical and personal care sectors, demand for child-resistant, precise-dispensing, and secure packaging solutions is creating opportunities for specialized closures. The market is highly competitive, with multinational corporations, regional players, and public companies competing on innovation, sustainability, and compliance with evolving regulations. Market leaders are expected to gain advantage by investing in recyclable materials, PCR content, and advanced tamper-evident technologies.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: January 05, 2026 02:13 AM\nSource:[prsync.com](http://prsync.com/grand-view-reesearch/plastic-caps--closures-market-consumer-preferences-shaping-innovation-5075816/)\n\n**This Cummins Analyst Turns Bullish; Here Are Top 3 Upgrades For Friday**\nOn December 19, 2025, Barclays analyst Adam Seiden upgraded Cummins Inc (NYSE: CMI) from Equal-Weight to Overweight and raised the price target from $515 to $546.

Despite modest results and ongoing challenges, PCAR3 shares rose 2.64% to R$ 3.89 (peaking at R$ 4.14) on November 5, 2025, driven by investor optimism over the company\u2019s efficiency plans. The company achieved a positive free cash flow (FCF) supported by improved working capital dynamics, though weighed down by heavy financial results. GPA announced a cost-cutting plan for 2026, including reducing capital expenditures to between R$ 300 million and R$ 350 million (down from R$ 693 million in the 12 months ended September 30, 2025) and cutting operating expenses by at least R$ 415 million compared to 2025 estimates. The same-store sales (SSS) growth was 4.1%, slightly above expectations but below the 5.0% recorded in the third quarter of 2024. The Proximidade segment led with a 17.4% revenue increase (R$ 651 million), while the Aliados segment saw a 41.2% revenue drop due to strategic divestment to protect margins. Gross margin remained stable at 27.6%, aided by efficient supplier negotiations and pricing discipline. Adjusted EBITDA reached R$ 412 million (9.0% margin), surpassing market expectations, but EBIT was only R$ 47 million (1.0% margin) due to R$ 76 million in unexpected operational expenses, primarily from store closures and restructuring. The net profit was boosted by a one-time R$ 415 million tax credit, which elevated the profit from continuing operations to R$ 142 million. Analysts from Genial Investimentos and XP Investimentos noted that while operational improvements are evident, the recurring earnings power remains weak, with the profit inflated by non-recurring tax benefits. Both firms maintained a 'hold' (neutral) recommendation, with Genial setting a target price of R$ 3.50. The macroeconomic environment remains challenging, and high leverage (at 15% base interest rates) continues to pressure financial performance.\nOriginal language: pt\nPublish date: November 05, 2025 03:42 PM\nSource:[InfoMoney](https://www.infomoney.com.br/mercados/gpa-pcar3-faz-licao-de-casa-no-3o-tri-mas-alavancagem-segue-preocupando-acao-sobe/)\n\n**PCAR Upgraded by Wolfe Research to 'Peer Perform' Rating | PCAR Stock News**\nOn October 22, 2025, Wolfe Research upgraded PACCAR Inc. (PCAR, Financial) from 'Underperform' to 'Peer Perform' without changing its price target. The upgrade reflects a more optimistic outlook on the company's stock market performance. This follows a series of recent analyst actions: On October 14, 2025, JP Morgan raised its price target from $97.00 to $103.00 (+6.19%); on October 8, 2025, Truist Securities lowered its price target from $98.00 to $97.00 (-1.02%); and on July 23, 2025, UBS upgraded from 'Sell' to 'Neutral' and raised its price target from $81.00 to $100.00 (+23.46%). PACCAR, a leading manufacturer of medium- and heavy-duty trucks under the Kenworth, Peterbilt, and DAF brands, operates primarily in the Americas, Australia, Europe, and South America. The company\u2019s sales are distributed across the trucks segment (74%), parts (20%), and financing (6%), with a network of 2,200 independent dealers. PACCAR holds approximately 30% of the Class 8 market share in North America and 15% in Europe.

The analyst, Scott Group, noted that PCAR is trading at 20x its trough 2025 EPS estimate, 20x its slightly recovering 2026 EPS estimate, and 15x its more normalized $6.80 EPS estimate, which compares to the stock's 5- and 10-year average forward P/E multiples of roughly 13x and 14x. The analyst expects PACCAR's gross margins to bottom in 4Q 2025 and believes the stock's performance is closely correlated with margin trends. While downside risk appears limited due to the margin trough, the analyst sees little upside as the 2026 EPS estimate remains below consensus. The upgrade reflects improved positioning relative to other truck OEMs amid Section 232 tariffs and rebates. PACCAR shares closed at $99.85 on October 21, 2025.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 22, 2025 07:44 AM\nSource:[StreetInsider.com](https://www.streetinsider.com/Analyst+Comments/Wolfe+Research+Upgrades+PACCAR+(PCAR)+to+Peerperform/25484310.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
