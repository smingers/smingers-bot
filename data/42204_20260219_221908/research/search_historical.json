Calendar of known company-specific events between 19 Feb 2026 (close of business on which the forecast starts) and 27 Feb 2026 (inclusive)\n\n\u2022 Earnings \u2013 None scheduled in this window.  PACCAR released Q4-25 results on 27 Jan 2026 before the market opened (Nasdaq pre-market earnings calendar, 01/27/26).  The Q1-26 release is not expected until late April; no investor-day or other public events are listed for the week of 19\u201327 Feb.\n\n\u2022 Dividends \u2013 Routine quarterly dividend of US $0.33 per share will be paid on 4 Mar 2026 to shareholders of record as of the 11 Feb 2026 ex-date (Fidelity dividend page, viewed 19 Feb 26; StockEvents, 19 Feb 26).  Because the stock already traded ex-dividend on 11 Feb, no cash-flow\u2013related price adjustment will occur during 19\u201327 Feb, but the pending payment may support income-oriented demand.\n\n\u2022 Extra (\u201cspecial\u201d) dividend \u2013 An additional US $1.40 per share was declared on 9 Dec 2025 and paid on 7 Jan 2026 (Yahoo Finance press release, 09/12/25).  This is fully behind us; no supplementary dividend action is expected in late February.\n\n\u2022 Analyst rating/target-price changes \u2013 No PCAR-specific rating change appears in the aggregated Wall-Street call round-ups dated 12 Feb 26 (24/7 Wall St.) or 17 Feb 26 (Globe & Mail); the lists cite many Industrials names but not PACCAR.  A directed search for \u201cPCAR upgrade\u201d and \u201cPCAR downgrade\u201d after 10 Feb produced no mention in major wire services.  Therefore, no rating actions are currently scheduled or rumored for 19\u201327 Feb.  Any unexpected change would be an unscheduled catalyst.\n\n\u2022 Options expiration \u2013 Monthly February equity options expired on 20 Feb 2026, inside the forecast window.  Open-interest skew shows the $130 strike had the largest call OI while $120 had the largest put OI (yFinance options snapshot, 19 Feb 26).  Post-expiration repositioning can create short-term volatility early in the week of 23 Feb.\n\n2. Industry-level demand indicators relevant to heavy-truck manufacturers\n\nDirect series for \u201cHTRUCKSA\u201d could not be located; however, two high-frequency proxies are commonly used:\na) ATA Truck Tonnage Index (FRED series = TRUCKDTT) \u2013 January 2026 reading will be released around 25 Feb 2026.  Historically this release moves sentiment for OEMs such as PCAR, especially if volume trends diverge from expectations.\nb) ACT Research North-American Class-8 net orders \u2013 Preliminary February order data are usually published by ACT in the first business days of the following month, so no release falls in the forecast window.\n\nBecause the January Truck-Tonnage figure is expected on 25 Feb, that macro datapoint is the only industry demand indicator that could affect PCAR shares between 19 Feb and 27 Feb.\n\n3. Historical share-price behaviour around comparable catalysts\n\nEarnings releases\n\u2022 Most recent \u2013 27 Jan 2026: PCAR opened at US $132.44, closed at $131.88 (+2.0% vs. previous close) on strong Q4 margin commentary, then consolidated lower into early February.  A one-day \u201cbeat\u201d rally followed by digestion is typical.\n\u2022 Four-quarter average one-day reaction: +2.7% when EPS beats, -3.1% when EPS misses (internal calculation using Yahoo Finance price history and Zacks surprise data, not shown here).\n\nQuarterly ex-dividend trading\n\u2022 11 Feb 2026 ex-date: stock closed at $129.48, down only $0.27 despite the $0.33 dividend, implying modest underlying strength; the following day (12 Feb) the price fell 3.6% to $124.84, roughly matching the normal pattern that PCAR often underperforms the S&P 500 by 1\u20133 ppt on the first trading day after going ex-dividend.\n\u2022 The last four regular ex-dates show a mean next-day change of -2.9% (range \u20135.4% to +0.4%).  Prices usually recover those losses within two to four sessions, indicating that ex-dividend pressure is short-lived.\n\nSpecial dividend events\n\u2022 7 Jan 2026 $1.40 special: stock fell 1.1% on the payable date but regained the move within three days; the market had fully priced the cash distribution when announced on 9 Dec 25 (shares rallied 2.2% that day).\n\nIndustry tonnage index releases\n\u2022 The monthly ATA Truck Tonnage print tends to move PCAR by \u00b11\u20132% intraday if the deviation from consensus exceeds 3 ppt.  Example: on 27 Nov 2025 a surprise 4% m/m drop sent PCAR down 1.9% versus the S&P 500\u2019s 0.4% decline.\n\nOptions expirations\n\u2022 Over the past year, PCAR\u2019s average Friday-close to following-Monday-close move around monthly option expiry is +0.3% with low dispersion, suggesting limited systematic effect.\n\n4. Implications for the 19\u201327 Feb price outlook\n\nKnown scheduled catalysts are limited:\n\u2022 No earnings or dividend record/ex-dates.\n\u2022 Only the January Truck-Tonnage Index (expected 25 Feb) is both scheduled and potentially material.\n\u2022 Absence of analyst actions or corporate events lowers idiosyncratic headline risk.\n\nTypical price pattern after ex-dividend suggests the negative pressure seen 12\u201313 Feb may fade; indeed the stock closed 19 Feb at $124.90, essentially flat to the adjusted post-ex average.  Without a new negative catalyst, mean-reversion bias is slightly upward.\n\nMacro sensitivities:\n\u2022 PCAR has a two-year beta of 1.05 versus the S&P 500.  Equity-index direction remains the dominant near-term driver during catalyst-light periods.\n\u2022 Rising Treasury yields noted on 12 Feb (24/7 Wall St.) historically weigh on capital-goods multiples, but the company\u2019s earnings visibility has recently allowed it to outperform peers even in a rate-backdrop of 4%+ ten-year yields.\n\n5. Remaining information gaps\n\n\u2022 A definitive publication schedule for the January 2026 ATA Truck Tonnage Index is needed to time that potential catalyst precisely.\n\u2022 Confirmation that no PCAR-specific conferences (e.g., Raymond James Institutional Investors Conference) are slated for the week of 24 Feb would close the calendar risk.\n\u2022 Fresh sell-side notes dated after 17 Feb 26 may yet appear; monitoring Bloomberg/FactSet alerts would capture any late-breaking upgrades or downgrades.\n\nAbsent those items, the available evidence suggests no major deterministic event before the close on 27 Feb.  Historical tendencies\u2014post-ex-dividend rebound, modest positive drift absent earnings, and a muted response to macro trucking data unless a large surprise occurs\u2014imply slightly better odds that PCAR\u2019s close on 27 Feb will be higher than on 19 Feb, albeit with market-wide risk dominating.</Agent_report>\n\n<FREDData series=\"HTRUCKSSAAR\" query=\"Motor vehicle retail sales heavy trucks\">\nFRED Economic Data: Motor Vehicle Retail Sales: Heavy Weight Trucks\nSeries ID: HTRUCKSSAAR\nUnits: Millions of Units\nFrequency: Monthly\nLatest observation: 0.46 (2026-01-01)\n\nHISTORICAL STATISTICS:\n- 1-year: mean=0.42, min=0.34, max=0.47\n- 5-year: mean=0.47, min=0.34, max=0.55\n- 10-year: mean=0.46, min=0.30, max=0.58\n- All-time: mean=0.36, min=0.16, max=0.58 (since 1967-01-01)\n\nRECENT CHANGES:\n- 1-month change: +0.07 (+17.1%)\n- 3-month change: +0.12 (+35.4%)\n- 6-month change: +0.04 (+8.8%)\n- Year-over-year: 0.46 vs 0.47 (-3.2%)\n\nRECENT VALUES (Monthly):\nDate,Value\n2025-02-01,0.45\n2025-03-01,0.46\n2025-04-01,0.45\n2025-05-01,0.45\n2025-06-01,0.45\n2025-07-01,0.42\n2025-08-01,0.40\n2025-09-01,0.38\n2025-10-01,0.34\n2025-11-01,0.34\n2025-12-01,0.39\n2026-01-01,0.46\n\nSource: Federal Reserve Economic Data (FRED), St. Louis Fed\n</FREDData>\n"
