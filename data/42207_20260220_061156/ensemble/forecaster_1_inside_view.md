Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

**FRED/YCharts data (Primary):** The most authoritative and directly relevant source. Shows DAAA at 5.25% on Feb 13, 17, and 18, 2026, after declining from 5.43% on Feb 4. Factual, high quality. The stability at 5.25% for three consecutive trading days is a strong factual anchor.

**AAA10Y spread data (FRED):** Shows the spread between DAAA and 10-year Treasury at 1.16-1.21% in mid-February 2026. Combined with the 10-year Treasury yield of ~4.058% (from CNBC, Feb 17), this implies DAAA ≈ 5.22-5.28%, consistent with the 5.25% reading. Corroborating factual evidence.

**CNBC Treasury yield article (Feb 17, 2026):** Reports 10-year Treasury at ~4.058%, 30-year at 4.689%. Factual, recent, high quality. Relevant for inferring DAAA via spread. The 30-year yield at 4.689% (Feb 19) is declining, suggesting mild downward pressure on long-duration rates.

**Morningstar/30-year Treasury article (Feb 19, 2026):** Reports 30-year yield fell to 4.704% on Feb 19, third lowest of the year, declining on 8 of past 10 trading days. This is a factual, recent data point suggesting a mild downward trend in long-duration rates, which could slightly pull DAAA lower.

**Federal Reserve FEDS Note (Feb 12, 2026):** Academic/institutional analysis explaining the rise in far-forward rates due to real risk premiums and fiscal concerns. Opinion from identifiable Fed economists (Covitz and Engstrom). Relevant for medium-term direction but not 3-day prediction.

**Moody's website summary:** General marketing content, no specific yield data or forecasts. Low relevance.

**CME Group page:** Product description for Ultra 10-Year Treasury futures. Not relevant to DAAA.

**AskNews articles:** Mostly tangential (Indonesian bonds, Russian OFZ, Banco BPM covered bonds, ETF articles). None directly address DAAA. The 30-year Treasury yield article (Feb 19) is the most relevant, confirming mild downward pressure on long rates.

**(b) Evidence Analysis**

**Strong evidence:**
- DAAA has been exactly 5.25% for three consecutive trading days (Feb 13, 17, 18). This stability is a strong anchor for the near-term forecast. The series appears to have found a near-term equilibrium.
- The spread between DAAA and 10-year Treasury (1.16-1.21%) combined with the 10-year at ~4.06% implies DAAA ≈ 5.22-5.27%, consistent with observed 5.25%.
- No major macro catalysts scheduled between Feb 20-25 (next FOMC is March, next CPI is March). This supports status quo.

**Moderate evidence:**
- 30-year Treasury yield declining (4.704% on Feb 19, down from 4.920% on Jan 20). This mild downward trend in long rates could exert slight downward pressure on DAAA, potentially pushing it toward 5.20-5.23%.
- CME FedWatch shows 92% probability of Fed hold at 3.50-3.75%. No rate cut expected, which removes a catalyst for a sharp yield decline.
- Fed FEDS Note identifies structural upward pressure from fiscal concerns and real risk premiums — medium-term upward bias but not relevant for 3-day window.

**Weak evidence:**
- General bond market commentary (India, Australia, Indonesia bonds) — not relevant to DAAA.
- BlackRock/institutional upward pressure arguments — medium-term, not 3-day.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

**Prediction timeframe:** 3 business days (Feb 23, 24, 25, 2026) from today (Feb 20).

At this very short horizon:
- Daily DAAA changes are typically 1-3 bps in normal conditions
- Over 3 business days, expected total movement is ±5-10 bps in normal conditions
- The series has been flat at 5.25% for 3 consecutive days, suggesting very low near-term volatility

**If timeframe halved (1-2 days):** Distribution would narrow further, with 80% CI perhaps ±5 bps. Central estimate still 5.25%.

**If timeframe doubled (6 business days):** Distribution would widen slightly, with 80% CI perhaps ±12-15 bps. Still centered near 5.25% but with more tail risk from unexpected macro events.

**(d) Justification**

The outside view base rate distribution (centered at 5.25%, 80% CI of 5.17-5.32%) is well-supported by current evidence. The key factors:

1. **Status quo stability:** Three consecutive days at exactly 5.25% is a strong signal of near-term equilibrium. The series has been declining from 5.43% (Feb 4) and appears to have stabilized.

2. **Mild downward pressure:** The 30-year Treasury yield has been declining (down 0.168% month-to-date as of Feb 19). This could nudge DAAA slightly lower, perhaps to 5.22-5.24%, but the magnitude is small.

3. **No major catalysts:** The next FOMC meeting and CPI release are in March. The holiday-shortened week (Presidents' Day Feb 16) is already past. No scheduled events that would cause a large move.

4. **Spread consistency:** The AAA-Treasury spread of 1.16-1.21% combined with the 10-year at ~4.06% implies DAAA in the 5.22-5.27% range, consistent with 5.25%.

5. **Slight downward bias from Treasury trend:** Given the 30-year Treasury declining, I'll shift the central estimate very slightly downward to ~5.24%, but this is a minor adjustment.

The outside view distribution is essentially confirmed by the inside view. I'll make a very slight downward adjustment to reflect the mild downward pressure from Treasury yields, shifting the median from 5.25% to approximately 5.24%.

**Distribution Calibration:**

- The series has been at 5.25% for 3 consecutive days
- Daily std dev historically ~2-3 bps; over 3 business days, ~4-5 bps
- Mild downward pressure from Treasury yields
- No major catalysts
- Tail risks: unexpected tariff escalation (upward), surprise dovish Fed signal (downward)

Central estimate: 5.24-5.25%
90% CI: approximately 5.12% to 5.38%

**Checklist:**

1. **Target variable:** Value of Moody's Seasoned Aaa Corporate Bond Yield (DAAA) on 2026-02-25, in percent. ✓

2. **Outside view base rate:** Centered at 5.25%, P10=5.12%, P20=5.17%, P40=5.23%, P60=5.27%, P80=5.32%, P90=5.38%. Current inside view is essentially the same with very slight downward nudge. ✓

3. **Consistency check:** Implied median ≈ 5.24-5.25%; mean ≈ 5.24-5.25%. This makes sense given 3 consecutive days at 5.25% and mild downward pressure. ✓

4. **Key evidence:**
   - DAAA = 5.25% on Feb 13, 17, 18 (three consecutive days of stability) ✓ Factual
   - 30-year Treasury declining (4.704% on Feb 19, down 0.168% MTD) ✓ Factual
   - No major macro catalysts Feb 20-25 ✓ Factual
   - AAA-Treasury spread 1.16-1.21% implies DAAA ~5.22-5.27% ✓ Factual
   - Fed holding rates at 3.50-3.75% with 92% probability ✓ Factual

5. **Blind-spot:** A sudden tariff escalation or geopolitical shock could cause a flight to quality (pushing Treasury yields down, possibly widening spreads) or a risk-off move in corporates (widening spreads, pushing DAAA up). This would push the outcome upward. Probability: low but non-negligible.

6. **Status quo:** Current value is 5.25%. Given 3-day horizon and low volatility, status quo strongly favors 5.25% ± small amount. Slight nudge toward status quo is appropriate.

7. **Technicalities:** Values strictly increasing, units in percent, within stated bounds (4.301-6.515). ✓
