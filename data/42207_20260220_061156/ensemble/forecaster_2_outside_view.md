Analysis:

## (a) Source Analysis

**FRED Data (Primary):** The most reliable source. Shows DAAA daily values with the latest at 5.25% on 2026-02-18. The series has been stable at 5.25% for three consecutive trading days (Feb 13, 17, 18). This is factual, authoritative data.

**YCharts Summary:** Confirms FRED data with 5.25% as of Feb 18, 2026. Also provides earlier values showing a declining trend from ~5.36-5.43% in early February to 5.25% by mid-February. High quality, corroborates FRED.

**Agent Report:** Synthesizes FRED data and provides context on Fed announcements. Key facts: FOMC held rates at 3.50-3.75% on Jan 28, 2026; January CPI came in at +0.2% m/m, +2.4% y/y (Feb 13). Indicative mean for recent period ~5.33%. Reliable synthesis.

**BlackRock Commentary:** Expert opinion from named institutional source. Notes upward pressure on bond yields from corporate borrowing and fiscal deficits. Opinion-based but from credible experts.

**Deloitte/Morningstar:** Macro context. Fed holding rates steady, inflation above target. Consistent with stable-to-slightly-elevated yield environment. Less directly relevant.

**Trading Economics:** Shows December 2025 value of 5.31% - less current than FRED data.

## (b) Reference Class Analysis

**Reference Class 1: Short-term DAAA daily changes (1-5 days)**
The most appropriate reference class. Over any given 5-day window, DAAA tends to move very little. The series has been at 5.25% for 3 consecutive days. Daily changes are typically in the range of ±0.05-0.10%.

**Reference Class 2: Weekly DAAA volatility**
Over a 1-week period, DAAA rarely moves more than 0.15-0.20% in either direction absent major macro shocks. The 1-month change is only -0.08%, suggesting low volatility.

**Reference Class 3: 12-month range**
The 1-year range is 5.04% to 5.71% (spread of 0.67%), with mean of 5.34%. This gives broader context but is too wide for a 5-day forecast.

The most suitable reference class is **short-term (5-day) DAAA changes**, given the question resolves on Feb 25, 2026 (5 trading days from the last observation on Feb 18).

## (c) Timeframe Analysis

The resolution date is 2026-02-25, which is 7 calendar days (approximately 5 trading days) from the last known value of 5.25% on 2026-02-18.

Historical patterns for DAAA over 5-trading-day windows:
- The series shows low day-to-day volatility, typically ±0.02-0.05% per day
- Over 5 days, the cumulative move is usually within ±0.10-0.15%
- The recent trend has been downward (from 5.43% on Feb 4 to 5.25% on Feb 13-18), but appears to have stabilized
- No major scheduled Fed meetings or CPI releases are expected in this window (next FOMC is March 2026; next CPI release is mid-March)
- The Feb 13 CPI print was benign (2.4% y/y), which contributed to the yield decline

Key upcoming events before Feb 25: Limited major catalysts. The market is in a relatively quiet period for macro data.

## (d) Justification

Starting point: 5.25% (last known value, Feb 18, 2026)

**Factors supporting stability near 5.25%:**
- Three consecutive days at exactly 5.25% suggests a temporary equilibrium
- No major macro catalysts expected in the next week
- Fed on hold, CPI recently released (benign), next major data far off
- The downward trend from early February appears to have stabilized

**Factors that could push yields higher:**
- BlackRock notes upward pressure from corporate borrowing and deficits
- If risk-off sentiment emerges or Treasury yields spike
- Tariff-related inflation concerns could resurface

**Factors that could push yields lower:**
- Continued benign inflation data
- Risk-off flight to quality
- Broader economic slowdown signals

**Central estimate:** ~5.25%, with the distribution centered very close to the current level. Given the stability over the past 3 days and lack of major catalysts, I expect the yield to remain in the 5.15%-5.35% range with high probability.

## Outside View Calibration

- The series has been at 5.25% for 3 days straight
- 5-day volatility historically is low (±0.10-0.15% covers ~80% of outcomes)
- No major macro events expected
- The 1-year min is 5.04%, max is 5.71%
- I'll center the distribution at 5.25% with modest spread
- Tail risks: unexpected Fed communication, geopolitical shock, or major economic data surprise could push yields ±0.20-0.30%
