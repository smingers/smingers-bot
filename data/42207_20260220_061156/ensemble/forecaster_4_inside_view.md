Analysis:
(a) Source analysis (chronological, most-to-least relevant)
1. FRED/Y Charts (Feb 18 2026, 5.25 %) – primary, machine-read data feed that defines resolution. Factual, high reliability.  
2. FRED spread series (Aaa – 10-yr Tsy, Feb 18 = 1.16 %) – direct measure of current credit spread; same data origin, high quality.  
3. CNBC & Morningstar Treasury-market briefs (Feb 17-19 2026) – quote 10-yr note ≈ 4.05 %; factual market data; good quality, same timeframe.  
4. Fed staff note (Feb 12 2026) – analysis of long-run drivers of forward rates; expert authorship, but largely opinion and medium-term.  
5. AskNews bundle of bond-market miscellany (Feb 18-19 2026) – factual but peripheral (Indonesia auction, covered-bond deals, ETFs). Useful only as background that global credit markets look calm.  
All other pieces are older or marketing material and carry negligible incremental weight for a 5-day forecast.

(b) Evidence analysis  
Strong:  
• Latest DAAA fixing = 5.25 %; series is highly persistent day-to-day.  
• Current 10-yr Tsy = ≈4.05 % and Aaa spread ≈1.15 %; neither shows large, fast moves recently.  
Moderate:  
• Down-drift of ~18 bp in DAAA since 4 Feb indicates mild bearish sentiment on rates and/or spreads.  
Weak:  
• Upcoming data releases (FOMC minutes, PCE) could jolt yields but historically move Aaa <10 bp over 48 h in absence of surprise.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Horizon = 5 calendar days (~3–4 trading days). If the horizon were halved, I would tighten the distribution by ~25 %; if doubled, widen by ~25 % because event risk compounds roughly with √time.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Outside-view baseline (random walk) centred on last print, σ(5-day) ≈7 bp from recent history.  Recent trend and soft macro data bias the centre down 1–2 bp.  Event-risk fat-tails inflated to ±17-bp (90 % band) to cover an unexpected macro surprise or flight-to-quality.  Spreads are stable, so most movement will mirror Treasury yields.

Distribution calibration
Mean/median anchored at 5.24 %.  Normal-ish body with slightly fatter tails:

Percentile 10: 5.08 %  (-17 bp)  
20: 5.14 %  
40: 5.22 %  
60: 5.28 %  
80: 5.36 %  
90: 5.44 %  (+20 bp)

Checklist:
1. Target = FRED DAAA reading (percent) dated 2026-02-25 (or 1-day prior).  
2. Base-rate distribution described above.  
3. Implied median ≈5.24; mean ≈5.25 – coherent with rationale and recent prints.  
4. Key evidence: (i) 5.25 % last value; (ii) 10-yr Tsy 4.05 %; (iii) Aaa-Tsy spread 1.16; (iv) downward drift this month; (v) calm credit markets.  
5. Blind-spot: major upside CPI shock on 21 Feb pushing 10-yr > 4.25 % (would push DAAA toward/above 5.45 %).  
6. Status-quo bias incorporated via peak density around 5.22–5.28.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, proper units, within open bounds.
