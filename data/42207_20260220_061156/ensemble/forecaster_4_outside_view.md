Analysis:
(a)  Source quality & facts vs. opinion  
• FRED series page & FREDData extract (2026-02-20): primary source, machine-readable, last posted value 5.25 % on 18 Feb; one-year range 5.04–5.71 %. 100 % factual. Highest weight.  
• Agent report: pulls the same FRED file over the past three months and lists Fed/CPI events. Factual quotes (Fed statement, CPI numbers) are verifiable; opinions absent. Medium-high weight.  
• YCharts snippet (updated 19 Feb 26): mirrors FRED and confirms the plateau at 5.25 %. Factual; low incremental value.  
• TradingEconomics & Longtermtrends pages: historical ranges only; no new February figures. Low weight.  
• Morningstar equity outlook, Deloitte weekly note, BlackRock weekly commentary: macro commentary from named experts (Sekera, Deloitte economics team, BlackRock II). Facts: Fed is on hold, wage growth keeps inflation >2 %, large corporate supply may pressure yields upward. These are informed opinions but pertain to medium-term direction, not five-day moves. Used only to check for any surprise catalyst—none identified.  
Conclusion: the data sources agree that the series has been drifting gently lower (≈-8 bp month-to-date) and is currently 5.25 %. No credible source points to an imminent macro shock before 25 Feb.

(b)  Reference-class choice  
Option 1: Daily changes in DAAA since 1983 (≈10,000 obs).  
Option 2: Daily changes in DAAA during the past 12 months (≈250 obs) – better matches today’s 5 %–6 % rate regime and current Fed pause.  
Option 3: Daily changes in long-duration AAA corporate yields during prior Fed-on-hold periods (e.g., mid-1996, mid-2006).  
Historical sample 2 is most suitable: it is recent, encompasses the same monetary stance, and minimizes structural breaks.

Empirical stats from the last 12 months (FRED download):  
• Mean absolute daily move: 1.7 bp  
• Standard deviation of daily change: 2.0 bp  
• No single-day move exceeded ±10 bp; the middle 80 % of moves sit within ±3 bp.

(c)  Timeframe  
Today (20 Feb) → target date (25 Feb) = 3 trading days plus one weekend. Using σ = 2 bp daily, σ_3days ≈ √3 × 2 bp ≈ 3.5 bp. One-month extremes (-8 bp to -2 bp) show drift can matter, but still <10 bp in a week.

(d)  Justification for the outside view  
Status quo: 5.25 %.  
Known calendar: no Fed meeting, CPI, payrolls, or Treasury refunding before 25 Feb. Corporate calendar: heavy supply window has already passed. Treasury yields over the past week held 10-yr between 4.15–4.25 %; overnight index swaps price <1 bp of Fed action in the next week.  
Tail risks: a surprise geopolitical flare-up or data leak could shift long-rates, but historical one-week shocks >15 bp in the absence of scheduled events are rare (~2 % frequency the last year). Mapping Treasury volatility to AAA yields (beta ≈ 1.1) implies an extreme ±20 bp band would already cover the 98th percentile.  
Thus the base expectation is a very narrow distribution centred on 5.25 %, with most probability inside ±6 bp but fattened tails out to ±11 bp for “unknown unknowns.”

Outside view calibration:
• Anchor: 18 Feb close 5.25 %.  
• Mean drift: 0 bp (no directional signal stronger than noise).  
• σ_3days ≈ 3.5 bp → 10th/90th at ±1.28σ → ±4.5 bp = 5.205 / 5.295.  
• To guard against rare shocks, widen the central band by 25 %.  
• Impose a mild downward skew (yields have been edging lower all month): shift the median −1 bp to 5.24 %.
