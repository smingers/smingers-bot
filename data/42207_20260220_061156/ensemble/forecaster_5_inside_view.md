Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED series DAAA (updated 19 Feb 2026) – primary, machine-readable; shows 5.25 % on 18 Feb after 5.27 % on 12 Feb. Pure fact.  
2. YCharts scrape (19 Feb 2026) – mirrors FRED; confirms gradual slide from 5.43 % (4 Feb) to 5.25 %. Good secondary data.  
3. FRED spread series (DAAA minus 10-yr Treasury) – confirms Aaa/Treasury spread is ≈1.16 %; credible, but derivative.  
4. CNBC (17 Feb 2026) – factual Treasury-yield quotes (10-yr ≈4.06 %). Quality market data; indirect signal.  
5. Morningstar “30-yr Treasury Data Talk” (19 Feb 2026) – same class of factual yield quotes, reliable.  
6. Fed staff note (12 Feb 2026) – peer-reviewed analysis; explains drivers of long-end yields, no short-term catalyst flagged.  
7. Moody’s marketing piece & assorted ETF / corporate-bond articles (18-19 Feb 2026) – largely opinion / marketing; no hard numbers on Aaa yields. Low weight.  

(b) Evidence weighting  
Strong: 1, 2 (hard observations of the target series); 3, 4, 5 (hard observations on Treasuries as the main driver).  
Moderate: 6 (structural upward pressure from higher real-risk premia, but long-term).  
Weak: 7 (sector commentary, ETF flows).

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Resolution is the DAAA fix dated 25 Feb 2026 – effectively four trading days away (20, 23, 24, 25 Feb prints). If timeframe were halved (two days) the standard deviation of moves would drop by ~√½ (to ≈4–5 bp); doubled (eight days) it would rise to ≈9–10 bp and tail risk of data surprises would increase.

(d) Justification / inside-view adjustments  
Base-rate (10-yr history) for a 4-day move: µ = 0 bp, σ ≈ 6 bp.  
Current facts that nudge the mean slightly downward (≈-1 bp):  
• Observable micro-trend: −18 bp in the last 12 trading days, with momentum still intact (Strong).  
• Treasury yields have slipped 3–5 bp this week with no large auctions until 26 Feb (Strong/Moderate).  
Offsetting upward forces:  
• No Fed meeting or tier-1 data → low catalyst to push yields sharply lower (Moderate).  
• Structural story of higher term premia (Fed note) argues against sudden big drops (Moderate).  

Net: expect a small continued drift lower but mostly mean-reversion; keep σ at 7–8 bp to cover ordinary volatility plus a cushion for unforeseen shocks (geopolitical, data leak, etc.).  

Distribution calibration
Median (50th ≈ between 40th & 60th) set at 5.24 – 5.25 %.  
Spread chosen so that central 80 % interval (10th–90th) spans 28 bp, a bit wider than pure statistical σ to incorporate “unknown-unknowns”.

Checklist:  
1. Target: DAAA percent value printed for 25 Feb 2026 (daily, percent, not seasonally adj.).  
2. Outside base: N(5.25 %, 0.06 %) four-day; inside shifts mean −1 bp, σ +1–2 bp.  
3. Implied median ≈ 5.25 %, mean ≈ 5.25 % — consistent with “slight downward bias, low vol”.  
4. Key evidence: (i) FRED shows 5.25 % last print; (ii) 12-day trend is downward 18 bp; (iii) Treasuries down ~4 bp this week; (iv) No major macro catalysts before 25 Feb; (v) 4-day historical SD ≈ 6 bp.  
5. Blind-spot: Sudden inflation scare (e.g., leaked hot PCE) sending long yields +20 bp; would push outcome well above my 90th.  
6. Status-quo bias affirmed: bulk weight near 5.25 %.  
7. Percentiles strictly increasing, units = percent.
