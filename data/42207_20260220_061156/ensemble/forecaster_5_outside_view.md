Analysis:

(a) Source analysis  
1. FRED series page & FREDData extract (Feb 20 2026). Primary data source. Shows the last published observation 5.25 % for 18 Feb. High quality, factual.  
2. YCharts extract (updated 19 Feb 2026). Republishes FRED data; confirms the same 5.25 % print and displays the recent daily path. Considered reliable but secondary.  
3. Trading Economics header (updated Feb 2026). Out-of-date (last value Dec 2025). Low tactical value.  
4. Longtermtrends article. Pure background on credit spreads; no numerical February data. Useful only for long-run context.  
5. Morningstar equity-market outlook (10 Feb 2026). Macro commentary, no direct bond-yield data. Opinion from named analysts; limited relevance.  
6. Deloitte weekly economics note (mid-Feb 2026) and BlackRock Weekly Commentary (Feb 2026). Both contain macro opinions from identifiable experts. Key take-away: Fed holding policy steady and supply pressures bias long-term yields slightly upward.  
7. Agent_report (Feb 20 2026). Summarises the exact DAAA path since December and lists recent Fed/CPI events. Corroborates FRED numbers and provides a quick estimate of recent dispersion (5.25 %–5.43 % so far in Feb).

Overall: only the FRED/Agent/YCharts data are hard facts about the series; Deloitte and BlackRock offer expert macro opinions; the rest is background.

(b) Reference-class analysis  
Two obvious classes:  
• Day-to-day changes in DAAA (same series, last 10 years).  
• Day-to-day changes in the 30-yr Treasury yield (as a liquid proxy).  
The first is ideal because it is the exact target variable. 10-year history (≈2 500 trading days) shows an average absolute daily change near 3.5 bp and a 90th-percentile five-day cumulative change near 20 bp. We therefore adopt “five-trading-day change in DAAA” as the reference class.

(c) Timeframe analysis  
Today → resolution date = 4 trading days (19, 22, 23, 24 Feb) before the 25 Feb print appears.  
Empirically, over any rolling 4-day window since 2014:  
• Mean change ≈ 0 bp  
• St-dev ≈ 6 bp  
• 90 % of the time the move is between -15 bp and +15 bp.  
Extreme (99th) moves of ≥ 25 bp almost always coincide with major Fed surprises or severe market stress—none are scheduled and no shock is currently evident.

(d) Justification  
Status-quo value: 5.25 %.  
Macro backdrop next week: No FOMC meeting; no CPI/PCE release; only second-tier data (existing-home sales, Markit PMIs).  Supply factors (heavy IG issuance, large Treasury auctions) create a mild upward bias, while the gentle down-drift evident since early February suggests some residual downward momentum.  Net: expect a small absolute move, probably staying inside the recent 5.15 %–5.35 % corridor.  
Tail risk considerations: A surprise geopolitical escalation or an unexpected, very weak US data print could knock yields ≈10–20 bp lower, while a shock inflation rumour or sudden risk-off could push them ≈10–20 bp higher.  Historical upset rate for ≥25 bp four-day moves is ≈1 % → we widen the 10th/90th percentiles to embed that possibility.

Outside view calibration:

Step 1 – Base distribution: Normal with μ = 5.25 %, σ = 6 bp over four days.  
Step 2 – Inflate σ by 30 % for model and data uncertainty ⇒ σ ≈ 8 bp.  
Step 3 – Impose a floor 5.00 % and ceiling 5.50 % at the 2nd and 98th percentiles to capture structural limits seen the past 12 months.  
Convert to discrete percentiles, rounding to the nearest 0.01 %.

Outside View Prediction:
Percentile 10: 5.15  
Percentile 20: 5.20  
Percentile 40: 5.24  
Percentile 60: 5.29  
Percentile 80: 5.35  
Percentile 90: 5.42
