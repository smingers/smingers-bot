Analysis:
To estimate the February-25 value of Moody’s Seasoned Aaa Corporate Bond Yield, the most useful near-term information will be:
• Daily changes in long-dated U.S. Treasury yields (10-, 20-, 30-year) because the Moody’s Aaa series closely tracks them plus a fairly stable “AAA” spread.  
• Any widening or tightening of high-grade corporate spreads (e.g., Bloomberg/ICE BofA AAA option-adjusted spread).  
• Market moves triggered by macro releases (Fed minutes, inflation data, employment claims) or fresh Fed guidance between now (Feb 20) and Feb 25.  
Therefore we need up-to-date market commentary and yield data rather than historical background. Searches should target business/financial outlets (Reuters, Bloomberg, WSJ) for the latest bond-market reports, and Moody’s/FRED references when available.
