Analysis:
We have to forecast the daily Moody’s Aaa corporate bond yield for 2026-02-25.  Because this is a long-maturity, high-grade bond index that generally tracks (1) the 20-year Treasury yield and (2) credit-spread movements, the most useful historical context is: 
• The recent day-to-day path of the DAAA series (especially the last six weeks).  
• The relationship between DAAA and 10-/20-year Treasury yields and how both have reacted to the latest Fed communications, CPI/PPI data, and recession expectations.  
• News or commentary since early February 2026 that could move long-term yields (e.g., surprise inflation print, Fed speeches, Treasury refunding outlook, credit-market risk sentiment).  

Therefore we need (a) raw time-series data from FRED to compute recent mean, change per day, and volatility, (b) financial-press coverage of Aaa or investment-grade corporate yields, and (c) general web pages (Bloomberg, Fed, Moody’s) discussing current yield levels and drivers.
