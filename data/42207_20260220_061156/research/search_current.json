The authors conclude any increase here is **too small** to explain the overall rise.\n4. **Far-forward real risk premium (prem[r^f])**: By process of elimination, this component is identified as the **primary driver** of rising far-forward rates.\n\n---\n\n### Conclusions\n- The rise in far-forward real risk premiums is linked to **reemerged old risks**: adverse supply shocks and fiscal sustainability concerns.\n- Despite these risks, **Fed credibility on inflation has remained intact**, as evidenced by stable inflation compensation and inflation expectations.\n- The authors characterize the current environment as a **\"new(ish) era\"** where supply-side and fiscal risks have returned, but the Fed's anti-inflation credibility has not been undermined.\n\n---\n\n*Note: The article appears to be truncated \u2014 the final section referencing Figure 3 and the Bauer-Rudebusch (2017) methodology was cut off before completion.*\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2026/02/17/us-treasury-yields-investors-look-ahead-to-more-delayed-data.html\">\n## Summary: 10-Year Treasury Yield Little Changed Amid Holiday-Shortened Week\n\n**Source:** CNBC | **Date:** February 17, 2026 | **Authors:** Sean Conlon, Sawdah Bhaimiya\n\n### Key Market Data Points (as of February 17, 2026):\n- **10-year Treasury yield:** ~4.058% (up less than 1 basis point)\n- **30-year Treasury bond yield:** 4.689% (down 1 basis point)\n- **2-year Treasury note yield:** 3.439% (up more than 2 basis points)\n\n### Context:\n- The bond market was closed Monday for **Presidents' Day**, making for a holiday-shortened trading week with a quiet Tuesday open.\n- Investors are awaiting several key data releases:\n  - **FOMC minutes** (Wednesday) \u2014 to be parsed for insights on the last rate decision and future monetary policy direction\n  - **Housing data** for November and December (Wednesday)\n  - **December PCE index** (Friday) \u2014 the Fed's preferred inflation gauge\n\n### Fed Rate Expectations:\n- Per the **CME FedWatch Tool**, traders are pricing in a **92% probability** that the Fed will hold interest rates unchanged in the **3.5%\u20133.75% range**.\n\n*Note: This article focuses on Treasury yields and does not directly reference Moody's Aaa Corporate Bond yields, though the broader interest rate environment described is contextually relevant.*\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://www.cmegroup.com/markets/interest-rates/us-treasury/ultra-10-year-us-treasury-note.html\">\n**Disclaimer:** This article is a product overview page from CME Group about Ultra 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note futures and does not contain information directly relevant to Moody's Seasoned Aaa Corporate Bond Yield (DAAA series).\n\n---\n\n## Summary\n\nThe article is a **CME Group product page** describing the **Ultra 10-Year U.S. Treasury Note futures contract**.

Lower demand was attributed to the Lunar New Year holidays, though concerns over policy predictability, central bank independence, and recent negative credit developments persist. Moody\u2019s cut Indonesia\u2019s credit outlook, and MSCI warned of a potential equity market downgrade due to transparency issues. The rupiah weakened to 16,933 per U.S. dollar amid expectations of a rate hold by Bank Indonesia, which is widely anticipated to maintain rates steady for a fifth consecutive meeting. Foreign investors accounted for 15% of winning bids, with Maybank noting stable foreign sentiment despite a slight dip in holdings.

The bond offers a fixed 8% annual coupon for the first two years, followed by variable 'inverse floater' coupons tied to the USD SOFR CMS 1-year rate for the remaining 11 years, with monthly payments on the 5th of each month. It has a maturity date of February 5, 2039, but can be called by the issuer at any time from February 5, 2028, to January 5, 2039, with a 10-day notice period. The issuer holds strong credit ratings: A from Fitch and S&P, and A1 from Moody's, indicating low credit risk. The bond is issued at par with a minimum investment of $1,000 (approximately \u20ac842.53 at an exchange rate of 1.1869). The article emphasizes that the bond\u2019s value increases when U.S. interest rates decline, as the inverse floater mechanism results in higher coupon payments during falling rate environments. However, if rates rise or remain high, investors face lower returns. Additionally, the callable feature limits price appreciation when rates fall, as the likelihood of early redemption increases. The article also notes that favorable currency movements\u2014such as a stronger dollar (above 1.20) and a weaker euro\u2014could further enhance returns, though these dynamics are complex and volatile. The investment is deemed suitable only for investors with high risk tolerance and full awareness of the instrument\u2019s risks.\nOriginal language: it\nPublish date: February 18, 2026 01:35 PM\nSource:[Money.it](https://www.money.it/cedola-mensile-e-8-annuo-per-2-anni-e-poi-fino-all-8-per-11-anni-su-questo-bond-in-dollari)\n\n**Rare High-Yield EIB Bond with 8% Coupon and Currency Risk: A High-Risk, High-Return Opportunity**\nThe article highlights a rare bond issued by the European Investment Bank (EIB), known as EIB Tf 8% St26 BRL, which has a nominal coupon of 8% per annum, a maturity date of September 30, 2026, and a current price of 99.99 (on the Borsa Italiana). The bond is denominated in Brazilian reais (BRL), not euros, and carries a triple-A credit rating (AAA) from Fitch, Moody's, and S&P, indicating extremely low credit risk. The bond offers a net annual yield of 6.95% after a 12.5% tax on interest and capital gains.

According to Nomura Investment Trust, the volatility of U.S. bond yields significantly decreased in 2025, even amid renewed market focus on Federal Reserve policy in the fourth quarter. However, concerns remain about the sustainability of U.S. fiscal policy, as the national debt surpassed $38 trillion despite government promises to increase revenue and reduce spending. Additionally, actions such as strained diplomatic relations with allies and perceived interference in Federal Reserve independence have eroded trust in U.S. Treasuries as a global safe-haven asset. For example, during the April 2025 announcement of reciprocal tariffs, U.S. equities fell sharply, but U.S. bonds did not act as a safe haven\u2014instead, they declined alongside stocks. While U.S. Treasuries remain irreplaceable, diversifying into high-quality bonds outside the U.S. can enhance portfolio resilience. Nomura\u2019s Taiwan-first Australia 10-year+ Sovereign & Quasi-Sovereign Bond ETF (00987B), launched in January 2026, is positioned as a strong alternative. According to fund manager Liu Conglin, Australia\u2019s sovereign bonds offer a rare combination of AAA credit rating, a 10-year yield of approximately 4.74%\u2014higher than comparable-rated U.S. Treasuries\u2014and strong fiscal discipline. Australia is one of only nine countries rated AAA by all three major agencies (Fitch, S&P, Moody\u2019s), with Moody\u2019s reaffirming the rating in November 2025. The ETF\u2019s three key features are: 1) high quality (AAA rating), 2) attractive yields (highest among AAA-rated bonds), and 3) diversification benefits by reducing overexposure to U.S. bonds and the U.S. dollar. Nomura\u2019s investment strategist Zhang Jiwen noted that Australia\u2019s stable political and economic environment, low default risk, effective inflation control, and transparent policies reinforce its long-term investment appeal. Historical data shows strong performance for Australian government bonds during Federal Reserve rate-cutting cycles. Liu Conglin recommends investors consider allocating to the 00987B ETF based on risk tolerance to reduce portfolio volatility. The ETF will be available for subscription from January 5 to January 9, 2026, at an issue price of NT$15 per share, aiming to attract income-oriented investors amid global market turbulence.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 07, 2026 07:25 AM\nSource:[Udnemoney\u806f\u5408\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2           ](https://money.udn.com/money/story/5607/9250464)\n\n**U.S. Economic Cooling Spurs Search for New Safe Havens: Nippon\u2019s 2026 Launch of Australia Bond ETF 00987B Targets High Yield and Resilience**\nIn 2025, global capital markets experienced dramatic swings due to U.S. tariffs and geopolitical concerns, with bond assets showing relatively stable performance and strong returns compared to the volatility in stock markets. The bond market volatility index in the U.S. declined significantly, even amid increased focus on Federal Reserve policy in the fourth quarter, supporting bond asset performance. Despite this, concerns remain about the long-term sustainability of U.S. fiscal policy, as the national debt surpassed $38 trillion in 2025, and political actions\u2014such as strained alliances and interference in Fed independence\u2014have weakened confidence in U.S. government bonds as a global safe-haven asset. Notably, during the April 2025 tariff announcement, U.S. bonds failed to act as a traditional safe-haven, falling alongside equities. In response, diversification beyond U.S. bonds is recommended to enhance portfolio resilience. According to Nippon Investment Trust, Australia\u2019s sovereign bonds stand out globally due to their AAA credit rating and higher 10-year yield compared to other high-grade bonds. Australia\u2019s strong fiscal discipline, stable economic structure, and consistent policy framework have earned it consistent AAA ratings from all three major credit agencies\u2014S&P, Fitch, and Moody\u2019s\u2014making it one of only nine countries with unanimous AAA ratings. The new 00987B Nippon Australia 10+ Year Sovereign & Quasi-Sovereign Bonds ETF, launched as Taiwan\u2019s first dedicated Australian bond ETF, offers high-quality exposure with a 4.74% 10-year yield, attractive income, and diversification benefits. Market analysts, including Zhang Jiw\u00e9n and Liu Conglin, highlight its potential to reduce portfolio volatility and serve as a strategic asset in a diversified bond allocation. The ETF will launch from January 5 to January 9, 2026, with an issue price of NT$15 per share. Investors are advised to consider long-term holding and risk tolerance, as single-country ETFs carry market, concentration, liquidity, and tracking error risks.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: January 05, 2026 02:24 AM\nSource:[MoneyDJ\u7406\u8ca1\u7db2](https://www.moneydj.com/kmdj/report/reportviewer.aspx?a=b08cf5c5-2c81-4517-ac4a-1b18c9254f3c)\n\n**New year, new yields: Why 2026 is the year for bond investors to shine | Stock Market News**\nAs of December 2025, India's bond market is poised for strong performance in 2026, driven by a shift in monetary policy. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate by 125 basis points in 2025, signaling a downward interest rate cycle. This environment benefits bond investors, as falling rates increase the value of existing bonds with higher yields. According to Vishal Goenka, Co-founder and CEO of IndiaBonds, this cycle will likely continue for another couple of years unless a major economic shock occurs. In a falling rate environment, bond investors face reduced market risk, and capital appreciation can occur\u2014evidenced by 10-year Government Securities (G-Secs) yielding 7.1% in 2025, which saw prices rise as yields dropped to 6.5%, generating double-digit total returns in some cases, outperforming volatile equity markets. While fixed deposits (FDs) have seen rapid rate cuts, bond yields remain sticky, offering higher returns. Goenka advises limiting FDs to 10\u201315% of bond investments, favoring direct bond investments aligned with risk profiles. Financial experts recommend a 'Barbell Strategy' for 2026: the 'Income Leg' in 2\u20133-year high-yield corporate bonds (rated A/A+) offering 9.5%\u201311%, and the 'Growth Leg' in 10\u201315-year G-Secs or AAA-rated PSU bonds for maximum capital gains. The 'Laddering Strategy'\u2014spreading \u20b95 lakh across five bonds with one-year maturity gaps\u2014is highlighted as the gold standard for risk management, allowing reinvestment at prevailing rates annually. The digital transformation of India\u2019s debt market, through online bond platforms, has made bond investing as accessible as stock or mutual fund trading. The outlook for 2026 is cautiously optimistic, with a flat-to-soft rate environment supporting corporate bond market growth.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: December 27, 2025 06:56 PM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/market/new-year-new-yields-why-2026-is-the-year-for-bond-investors-to-shine-11766860690474.html)\n\n**Nikko Launches Taiwan's First Australian AAA Bond ETF in January 2026, Highlighting 'Demographic Dividend' and Credit Strength**\nNikko Asset Management will launch Taiwan's first bond ETF focused on Australian sovereign and quasi-sovereign bonds, the 'Nikko Australia 10+ Year Sovereign & Quasi-Sovereign Bonds ETF (00987B-TW)', with fundraising from January 5 to January 9, 2026, and listing scheduled for January 22, 2026. The ETF targets Australia's long-standing AAA credit rating from all three major international rating agencies\u2014Fitch, S&P, and Moody's\u2014since 1992, with consistent AAA status maintained through 2024\u20132025. Australia is one of only nine countries globally to receive a unanimous AAA rating from the three agencies. The fund highlights Australia's 'demographic dividend'\u2014a population exceeding 27 million with a 1.6% annual growth rate, driven by over 315,000 net immigrants\u2014resulting in a high working-age population share (64.3%) and unemployment below 4.2%. This demographic strength supports robust service and consumption demand. Economic forecasts from Bloomberg project Australia's GDP growth in 2026 and 2027 to outperform other major developed economies. The 10-year Australian government bond yield is approximately 4.15%, and the 2-year yield is around 3.25%, offering attractive long-term returns amid low default risk and strong inflation control. Nikko's investment team emphasizes that Australia's policy stability and transparent investment environment enhance its long-term appeal, especially during Federal Reserve rate-cutting cycles, where historical data shows strong performance. The launch marks a milestone in Taiwan's bond ETF market, offering investors a diversified, high-credit-quality asset class.\nOriginal language: zh\nPublish date: December 16, 2025 11:57 AM\nSource:[Yahoo!

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) reduced the repo rate from 6.5% to 5.5% between February and June 2025, initially lowering yields and increasing bond prices. However, yields have since rebounded: the 10-year government bond yield rose from 6.2% in May 2025 to 6.51%, and the 30-year government bond yield increased from 6.75% in April 2025 to 7.2%. State Government Securities (SGS) yields have also risen sharply, with a primary auction on 30 September 2025 setting a cut-off yield of 7.58%\u2014higher than some AAA-rated corporate bond yields. This reflects a market opportunity, as SGS yields are now above certain corporate bond yields, offering better credit quality at comparable returns. Debt mutual funds, including those focused on SGS and corporate bonds, have seen lower net asset values (NAVs) due to falling prices, creating a more attractive entry point. Although some believe the RBI\u2019s rate cut cycle is nearly over and the rally has already occurred, a potential final 25 basis point (0.25%) cut remains possible, which could temporarily depress yields. However, for investors with a long-term horizon, current YTM levels offer a strong value proposition.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: October 05, 2025 11:16 AM\nSource:[mint](https://www.livemint.com/money/personal-finance/rbi-repo-rate-cut-government-bond-yields-yield-to-maturity-10-year-g-sec-yield-corporate-bond-debt-investments-11759469367994.html)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
