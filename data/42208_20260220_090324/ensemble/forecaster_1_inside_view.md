## Analysis

### (a) Source Analysis

**Washington Birthday Celebration Events (washingtonbirthday.com)**: Primary source for Alexandria, VA events. Reliable organizational website. Confirms events on Feb 20 (private reception) and Feb 21 (symposium + gala) within the measurement window. Feb 22 is Washington's actual birthday. Factual, credible.

**Fraunces Tavern Museum (frauncestavernmuseum.org)**: Primary source for George Washington Birthday Ball on Feb 20, 2026 in NYC. Reliable institutional source. Confirms organized events on the start date of the measurement window.

**GWMNMA Gala (gwmemorial.org)**: Primary source confirming sold-out gala event. Reliable. Confirms high organized interest but the event is Feb 21, before the likely peak of the measurement window.

**TIME article (Feb 14, 2026)**: Credible mainstream media. Confirms Presidents' Day media coverage peaked around Feb 14-16. Published before the measurement window—confirms the pre-window peak context.

**NBC Washington (Feb 15, 2026)**: Reliable local news. Confirms Presidents' Day = Feb 16, 2026. Logistical article, limited direct relevance to post-holiday trends.

**Pascack Press (Feb 17, 2026)**: Local news, reliable. Confirms George Washington Birthday celebration on **Feb 22, 2026** at Historic New Bridge Landing, NJ. This is within the measurement window and could contribute to search interest around Feb 22.

**AskNews - AP Trending (Feb 19, 2026)**: Reliable AP wire. Notes Trump administration removed a slavery exhibit depicting people enslaved by George Washington, with a federal judge ordering restoration by Feb 20. This is a notable current news story directly mentioning George Washington that could sustain search interest.

**George W. Bush Presidents' Day message (Feb 17, 2026)**: Credible political news. Bush essay invoking George Washington's virtues as implicit Trump criticism. Published Feb 17—could have contributed to search interest around that date, but likely already captured in the pre-window peak.

**Other AskNews articles**: Largely irrelevant to George Washington search trends (Bitcoin, Rousey/Carano, Springsteen, etc.).

### (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence for Decreases:**
- **Historical post-Presidents Day decay pattern**: The outside view analysis established that in 5/5 historical years, "george washington" search interest declined sharply from Presidents Day (Feb 16) through Feb 25. The current value on Feb 20 is already 65 (down from 100 on Feb 16), confirming the decay is underway. This is the most powerful predictor—multiple years, consistent pattern, direct causal mechanism (holiday has passed).
- **Current trajectory**: Value already dropped from 100 → 65 between Feb 16 and Feb 20. The trend is clearly downward. For "Doesn't change," the value would need to stay within 62-68 through Feb 25, which contradicts the historical pattern of continued steep decline.

**Moderate evidence for partial resistance to decline:**
- **Feb 22 Washington's actual birthday events**: Multiple organized events on Feb 22 (Bergen County Historical Society event, ongoing Alexandria celebrations). Washington's actual birthday could generate a secondary search interest bump. However, historically this hasn't been large enough to prevent the overall downward trend.
- **George Washington slavery exhibit controversy**: AP article (Feb 19, 2026) reports Trump administration removed a slavery exhibit depicting people enslaved by George Washington, with a federal judge ordering restoration by Feb 20. This is an active news story that directly invokes "George Washington" and could sustain some search interest during Feb 20-25. This is a notable factor not present in typical historical years.

**Weak evidence for Increases:**
- No major anticipated events that would dramatically boost searches above the Feb 20 level of 65.
- The Feb 22 birthday and ongoing controversy could theoretically push values above 65, but this would require an unusual confluence of factors.

### (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction window**: Feb 20 to Feb 25, 2026 (5 days). Resolution requires >3 point change.

**If halved (2-3 days)**: The probability of "Decreases" would be slightly lower, as the decline might not have fully manifested yet. Feb 22 birthday could create a temporary plateau or slight uptick in the first 2-3 days.

**If doubled (10 days)**: "Decreases" probability would be even higher—by late February/early March, search interest in "george washington" would almost certainly be near baseline levels.

The 5-day window is sufficient for the historical decay pattern to manifest clearly. The current value of 65 needs to drop only 4 points (to 61 or below) to resolve "Decreases." Given historical drops of 50+ points in this window, this threshold is easily met.

---

### (d) Justification

**Key factors:**

1. **Post-holiday decay is the dominant force**: Presidents' Day (Feb 16) was the peak. The holiday has passed. Historical data shows 5/5 years with steep declines from the post-Presidents Day value through Feb 25. This is the strongest signal.

2. **Current trajectory confirms decline**: The drop from 100 to 65 between Feb 16 and Feb 20 is already consistent with the historical pattern. The question is whether the decline continues—and historically, it always does.

3. **Feb 22 birthday and controversy as moderating factors**: The George Washington slavery exhibit controversy (active news story as of Feb 19-20) and the Feb 22 birthday celebrations could slow the decline or create a temporary bump. However, these are unlikely to reverse the overall trend sufficiently to push the Feb 25 value above 68 (the threshold for "Doesn't change").

4. **The threshold is low**: "Decreases" requires only a drop of more than 3 points from 65 (i.e., below 62). Given the historical pattern of 50+ point drops in this window, even a significant moderation of the decline would still result in "Decreases."

5. **No unprecedented events anticipated**: No major scheduled events (elections, crises, etc.) that would dramatically boost George Washington searches above current levels.

**Adjustment from outside view**: The outside view was 92% Decreases. The inside view factors (slavery exhibit controversy, Feb 22 birthday events) provide slight upward pressure on "Doesn't change" and very slight upward pressure on "Increases." However, the threshold for "Doesn't change" (staying within 62-68) is very tight given the historical pattern. I'll adjust slightly toward "Doesn't change" but maintain a very high probability for "Decreases."

## Probability Calibration

- **Decreases (below 62 by Feb 25)**: Historical pattern is extremely strong (5/5 years), current trajectory confirms decline, threshold is easily met. The slavery exhibit controversy and Feb 22 birthday are moderating factors but insufficient to prevent a >3 point drop. ~89%
- **Doesn't change (62-68 by Feb 25)**: Would require an unusual plateau sustained by the controversy and birthday events. Possible but historically rare. ~8%
- **Increases (above 68 by Feb 25)**: Would require search interest to rise above current levels—extremely unlikely given post-holiday context. ~3%

## Checklist

1. **Resolution criteria**: "Decreases" if Feb 25 value < Feb 20 value by >3 points; "Increases" if >3 points higher; "Doesn't change" if within 3 points. Window: Feb 20-25, 2026. ✓

2. **Outside view base rate**: 92% Decreases, 5% Doesn't change, 3% Increases. Inside view adjusts slightly toward Doesn't change due to active news story and Feb 22 birthday. ✓

3. **Consistency check**: Most likely = Decreases; Least likely = Increases. Makes sense given post-holiday decay pattern and current declining trajectory. ✓

4. **Key evidence**:
   - Historical 5/5 years show steep post-Presidents Day decline ✓ (strong, reliable)
   - Current value already dropped 100→65 by Feb 20 ✓ (factual, confirmed)
   - Slavery exhibit controversy could sustain some interest ✓ (moderate, plausible)
   - Feb 22 birthday events within window ✓ (factual, confirmed)
   - Threshold of only 3 points makes "Decreases" very achievable ✓

5. **Blind spot**: The slavery exhibit controversy (judge ordering restoration by Feb 20) could generate sustained media coverage of "George Washington" through the week, potentially keeping values elevated. This is the most likely scenario to make my forecast look wrong—but even so, a drop from 65 to 62+ over 5 days seems very likely given historical patterns.

6. **Status quo**: The status quo is a declining trend already in progress. Slight nudge toward "Decreases" is appropriate.

7. **Probabilities sum to 100**: 3 + 8 + 89 = 100 ✓

Probabilities: [3, 8, 89]
