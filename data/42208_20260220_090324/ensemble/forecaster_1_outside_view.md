Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

- **SerpApi website**: Technical description of the API service. No relevant trend data. Reliable for understanding methodology.
- **National Archives article (2004)**: Historical piece on Washington's Birthday as a federal holiday. No trend data. Factually reliable but not directly relevant.
- **AP News (Feb 16, 2025)**: Historical/cultural context on Presidents Day evolution. Published around Presidents Day 2025. Credible source. Relevant context: media interest in Washington peaks around Presidents Day.
- **Economic Times article**: Explains Presidents Day 2026 fell on February 16. Relevant: confirms the holiday was Feb 16, 2026, meaning the peak search interest likely occurred on/around that date—before the Feb 20–25 window.
- **Alexandria parade article (Feb 12, 2026)**: Confirms parade on Feb 14, 2026. Events before the measurement window. Relevant for understanding pre-window peak.
- **Mount Vernon birthday celebration**: Event on February 22, 2026. This is within the measurement window (Feb 20–25) and could sustain or boost interest around Feb 22.
- **Florida Governor press release**: Washington's Birthday Weekend Feb 12–16. Events before the window. Relevant for confirming the pre-window peak.
- **Agent report**: High-quality analysis of 5-year historical Google Trends data. Shows consistent pattern: peak on Presidents Day, then sharp decline (~85-90 points) by Feb 25. Most relevant source. Notes Feb 22 (Washington's actual birthday) doesn't typically generate a secondary spike large enough to prevent overall decline.
- **Google Trends Data**: Shows current value on Feb 20 is 65, down from peak of 100 on Feb 16 (Presidents Day). The decline from 100→65 has already occurred. The question asks about change from Feb 20 (65) to Feb 25.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes apply:

1. **Generic 5-day Google Trends windows**: Base rate data shows 43% increase, 35% decrease, 22% no change. However, this is a generic baseline that doesn't account for seasonal context.

2. **Post-Presidents Day decay pattern for "george washington"**: Historical data from 5 years shows a consistent, steep decline from the Presidents Day peak through Feb 25. This is highly specific and directly applicable. In all 5 years, the value on Feb 25 was dramatically lower than on the day after Presidents Day.

3. **Post-holiday search interest decay**: General pattern for holiday-related searches to decline after the holiday passes. Strongly applicable.

The most suitable reference class is #2 (post-Presidents Day decay for "george washington"), as it's directly analogous to the current situation.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The window is Feb 20–25, 2026 (5 days). Presidents Day 2026 was Feb 16. By Feb 20 (today), the value has already dropped from 100 to 65. The question is whether it continues to drop from 65 to below 62 (decrease) or rises above 68 (increase) or stays within 62-68 (no change) by Feb 25.

Historical pattern: After Presidents Day, values continue declining through Feb 25. However, Feb 22 is Washington's actual birthday, which could provide a small secondary bump. The Mount Vernon celebration on Feb 22 is a notable event. But historically, the agent report notes that Feb 22 doesn't typically prevent the overall declining trend—the values by Feb 25 are always in the low teens (10-14) on the 30-day scale.

However, the scaling matters here. The question uses the Jan 26–Feb 25 window. In this window, the peak is around Feb 16 (100). By Feb 20, we're at 65. Historical patterns suggest continued decline toward ~10-14 by Feb 25. That would be a decrease of more than 3 points from 65, easily satisfying the "Decreases" criterion.

The Feb 22 birthday celebration at Mount Vernon could create a small bump, but historically this hasn't been large enough to reverse the trend. Even if there's a slight uptick on Feb 22, the overall trajectory from Feb 20 to Feb 25 is almost certainly downward.

**(d) Justification**

The evidence strongly points to "Decreases":

1. **Current value (Feb 20) = 65**, down from peak of 100 on Feb 16. The holiday has passed.
2. **Historical pattern**: In all 5 years examined, the value on Feb 25 was ~10-14 (on the 30-day scale), representing an ~85-90 point drop from the Presidents Day peak. From 65 on Feb 20, continuing to ~10-14 by Feb 25 would be a decrease of ~50+ points—far exceeding the 3-point threshold.
3. **Feb 22 birthday**: While Washington's actual birthday may cause a small uptick, it has never historically been large enough to reverse the post-Presidents Day decline trend.
4. **No major news events** are anticipated that would dramatically boost "george washington" searches in this window.
5. The "Increases" scenario would require search interest to rise above 68 by Feb 25—highly unlikely given the post-holiday decay pattern.
6. "Doesn't change" would require staying within 62-68—also very unlikely given the steep historical declines.

Outside view calibration:

The historical base rate from the agent report is essentially 5/5 years showing "Decreases" in this specific post-Presidents Day window. The generic 5-day window base rate (35% decrease) is far less relevant than this highly specific reference class.

The main uncertainty is:
- Feb 22 birthday events at Mount Vernon could cause a temporary spike that might partially offset the decline, but historically this doesn't prevent the overall downward trend.
- The scaling of the Jan 26–Feb 25 window means the Feb 25 value will be much lower than Feb 20's 65.

Given 5/5 historical years show "Decreases" with very large margins (50+ points), and the current trajectory already showing decline, I assign very high probability to "Decreases."

Small probability to "Doesn't change" (Feb 22 birthday bump could theoretically keep values elevated, but historically this hasn't happened).

Negligible probability to "Increases" (would require a major unexpected news event).

Outside View Prediction:
Option_A (Increases): 3
Option_B (Doesn't change): 5
Option_C (Decreases): 92
