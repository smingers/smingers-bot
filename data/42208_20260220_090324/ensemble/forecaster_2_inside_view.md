## Analysis

### (a) Source Analysis

**Google Trends data (current value = 100 on Feb 16, declining to ~65 by Feb 20):** High quality, direct quantitative evidence from the same database used for resolution. Shows the holiday peak has already passed and decay is underway.

**Washington Birthday Celebration events (washingtonbirthday.com, frauncestavernmuseum.org, gwmemorial.org):** Primary sources, reliable event listings. Confirm events on Feb 20 (private reception, NY ball) and Feb 21 (symposium, gala - sold out) and Feb 22 (Bergen County NJ event). These are relatively niche, ticketed events unlikely to drive mass search interest.

**TIME article on Presidents' Day (Feb 14, 2026):** Reliable mainstream media. Confirms Presidents' Day was Feb 16, 2026 - already past. Signals peak media attention was around Feb 14-16.

**NBC Washington article (Feb 15, 2026):** Reliable local news. Confirms holiday logistics - all past.

**AP Trending Summary (Feb 19, 2026):** Reliable wire service. Notes the Trump administration removed a slavery exhibit depicting enslaved people of George Washington, with a federal judge ordering restoration by Feb 20. This is a notable news item that could sustain some search interest in "george washington" beyond the holiday.

**George W. Bush Presidents' Day essay (Feb 17, 2026):** Reliable news. Bush implicitly criticized Trump using Washington as a foil - could generate some continued media discussion of Washington.

**Pascack Press (Feb 17, 2026):** Local news, reliable. Bergen County event on Feb 22 - small local event, minimal search impact.

**Snopes fact-check on George Will deepfake (Feb 19, 2026):** Reliable. The deepfake video uses "George Will" not "George Washington" - minimal relevance.

**Newswise (Feb 20, 2026):** George Washington University Law School expert on SCOTUS tariff ruling - this is about GWU, not George Washington the person. Minimal relevance.

### (b) Evidence Analysis

**Strong evidence for Decreases:**
- Historical pattern: 5/5 years (2021-2025) show "george washington" search interest decreasing from Feb 20 to Feb 25 post-Presidents' Day. This is a robust, repeating seasonal pattern.
- Current trend data: Values already declining sharply: 100 (Feb 16) → 95 (Feb 17) → 81 (Feb 18) → 79 (Feb 19) → ~65 (Feb 20). The decay trajectory is clearly established and mirrors historical patterns.
- Presidents' Day (Feb 16) has already passed - the primary driver of search interest is gone.

**Moderate evidence that could slow/reverse decline:**
- Trump administration's removal of the slavery exhibit depicting Washington's enslaved people, with court-ordered restoration by Feb 20 - this is an active news story that could sustain some search interest. However, it's more likely to drive searches for "slavery exhibit" or "Independence Hall" than specifically "george washington."
- George W. Bush's Presidents' Day essay using Washington to criticize Trump - already published Feb 17, likely already baked into the declining trend.
- Washington's actual birthday is Feb 22 (within the window) - historically this produces at most a minor uptick insufficient to reverse the overall trend.
- 250th anniversary of the nation (2026) may generate slightly more coverage than typical years.

**Weak evidence for Increases:**
- Various local events (symposium, gala, Bergen County celebration) are niche and unlikely to drive mass search volume.
- The slavery exhibit story is more of a Trump/civil rights story than a "george washington" search driver.

### (c) Timeframe Analysis

**Prediction timeframe:** 5 days (Feb 20 → Feb 25, 2026).

If halved to ~2.5 days (Feb 20 → Feb 22): The probability of "Decreases" would be slightly lower because the Feb 22 birthday sometimes produces a minor uptick, and there's less time for the full decay to manifest. But still likely "Decreases."

If doubled to ~10 days: "Decreases" probability would be even higher, as the trend would have more time to fully decay to baseline.

### (d) Justification

The outside view is extremely strong: 5/5 historical post-Presidents'-Day windows show "Decreases." The current data confirms the decay is already underway (100 → 65 over 4 days). The resolution threshold is ±3 points, which is tight - the historical average decline is ~15-20 points over this window.

The inside view adjustments are minor:
- The slavery exhibit news story (court-ordered restoration by Feb 20) is the most notable factor that could sustain interest, but it's primarily a civil rights/Trump story, not a "george washington" search driver.
- The 250th anniversary context may generate slightly more coverage of Washington's Feb 22 birthday than usual, but this has never been sufficient to reverse the post-holiday decline in prior years.
- Bush's essay has already been published and is likely already reflected in the current declining trend.

The combination of factors does not come close to warranting a shift from "Decreases" as the dominant outcome.

## Probability Calibration

**Checklist:**

1. **Resolution criteria:** Compare Google Trends value for "george washington" on Feb 25 vs Feb 20 (Jan 26–Feb 25 window). Increases if >3 higher; Decreases if >3 lower; Doesn't change if within ±3.

2. **Outside view base rates:** Decreases: 75%, Doesn't change: 10%, Increases: 15%.

3. **Consistency check:** Most likely = Decreases; Least likely = Doesn't change; Yes, this aligns with the strong seasonal pattern and current declining trend.

4. **Key evidence:**
   - 5/5 historical post-Presidents'-Day windows show Decreases (strong, repeating pattern)
   - Current trend already declining sharply: 100→65 in 4 days (strong, direct evidence)
   - Presidents' Day (Feb 16) already past - primary search driver gone (structural)
   - Slavery exhibit news story could sustain minor interest (weak-moderate, indirect)
   - Washington's actual birthday Feb 22 historically insufficient to reverse decline (moderate)

5. **Blind spot:** A major viral news story specifically about George Washington (e.g., a major historical discovery, a prominent political controversy directly invoking his name) could spike searches. This seems unlikely given current news landscape but would shift toward Increases.

6. **Status quo:** The status quo is continued decline - the trend is already moving toward "Decreases" and there's no strong countervailing force.

7. **Technicalities:** Probabilities sum to 100, no % signs.

Given the overwhelming historical evidence and the already-established declining trend, I'll adjust slightly from the outside view to give marginally more weight to "Decreases" and slightly less to "Increases," given the inside view evidence confirms the pattern is playing out as expected.

**Final calibration:**
- Decreases: 82 (up from 75, given current trend confirmation)
- Doesn't change: 8 (down slightly)
- Increases: 10 (down from 15, given no strong inside-view catalyst)

Probabilities: [10, 8, 82]
