Analysis:

**(a) Source Analysis**

- **SerpApi website**: Technical documentation about the API service used for resolution. No content about George Washington search trends. High reliability for understanding the resolution mechanism.

- **National Archives article (2004)**: Historical piece about Washington's Birthday as a federal holiday. Factual, authoritative source. No Google Trends data. Establishes February 22 as Washington's actual birthday.

- **AP News (Feb 16, 2025)**: Journalistic piece about Presidents Day evolution. Published around Presidents Day 2025. Relevant context: confirms the holiday's commercial nature and its disconnection from Washington's actual birthday. Suggests media attention peaks around Presidents Day.

- **Economic Times article**: Explains Presidents Day 2026 falls on February 16. Key insight: the holiday and associated media coverage preceded the Feb 20-25 window, suggesting search interest would naturally decline after Feb 16.

- **Alexandria parade article (Feb 12, 2026)**: Reports on the George Washington Birthday Parade on Feb 14, 2026. This event preceded the measurement window (Feb 20-25), so any search spike from it would have already occurred.

- **Mount Vernon birthday celebration**: Scheduled for February 22, 2026. This is within the measurement window and could sustain some interest in "george washington" around Feb 22. This is a notable factor.

- **Florida Governor press release**: Washington's Birthday Weekend events Feb 12-16, 2026. Entirely before the measurement window.

- **Agent Report**: High-quality analysis drawing on 5 years of historical Google Trends data. Key findings: (1) Peak always occurs on Presidents Day (third Monday in February); (2) Sharp decline of ~85-90 index points occurs between the holiday peak and Feb 25; (3) The value on Feb 25 is typically 11-14% of the Presidents Day peak; (4) No year showed sustained elevated interest through Feb 25 except minor bumps.

- **Google Trends Data**: Shows the current value on Feb 20, 2026 is 65, down from the peak of 100 on Feb 16 (Presidents Day). The trend is declining: 100 → 95 → 81 → 79 → 65 over Feb 16-20.

**(b) Reference Class Analysis**

Several reference classes are applicable:

1. **Generic 5-day Google Trends windows for "george washington"**: Base rate shows 43% increase, 35% decrease, 22% no change. However, this is not context-sensitive to the post-holiday period.

2. **Post-Presidents Day decline pattern (most suitable)**: The agent report shows that in every year from 2021-2025, the value on Feb 25 was dramatically lower than the Presidents Day peak. The question compares Feb 20 to Feb 25. In 2026, Presidents Day was Feb 16. By Feb 20, the value has already declined to 65. The question is whether it continues declining from Feb 20 to Feb 25.

3. **Historical Feb 20-25 windows specifically**: In years where Presidents Day was Feb 16-20, the Feb 20-25 window would show continued decline. Looking at 2025 (Presidents Day Feb 17): values would have been declining through Feb 20-25. In 2023 (Presidents Day Feb 20): Feb 20 would be the peak, and Feb 25 would be much lower.

The most suitable reference class is the **post-Presidents Day decline trajectory**, specifically examining what happens in the days following the holiday peak when the holiday has already passed.

**(c) Timeframe Analysis**

The prediction window is Feb 20 to Feb 25, 2026 (5 days). Presidents Day 2026 was Feb 16. By Feb 20, we're already 4 days post-holiday, with the value at 65 (down from 100).

Historical pattern: The decline from Presidents Day to Feb 25 is steep and consistent. The current trajectory (100→95→81→79→65) shows continued decline. 

However, there's a notable factor: **Washington's actual birthday is February 22**, which falls within the measurement window. Mount Vernon is hosting a major birthday celebration on Feb 22. This could create a secondary bump. But historically, even with Feb 22 falling within the window, the overall trend is downward by Feb 25.

Looking at 2022 specifically (Presidents Day was Feb 21, Washington's birthday Feb 22): the peak was on Feb 21, and by Feb 25 it had fallen to ~13. But in that case, the peak was at the start of the window.

For 2026: The Feb 22 birthday celebration at Mount Vernon and associated media coverage could create a minor bump around Feb 22, but the overall trajectory from Feb 20 to Feb 25 should still be downward given the post-holiday normalization.

**(d) Justification**

The evidence strongly points toward "Decreases":

1. **Current trajectory**: The value has been declining steadily: 100 (Feb 16) → 95 → 81 → 79 → 65 (Feb 20). This is a clear downward trend.

2. **Historical precedent**: In all 5 years examined, the value on Feb 25 was dramatically lower than the Presidents Day peak, typically in the 10-14 range. Even if Feb 20 is at 65, the value on Feb 25 is expected to be much lower (perhaps 15-25 range given the scale of the current window).

3. **Washington's birthday (Feb 22)**: Could create a minor secondary bump, but historically this doesn't prevent the overall decline by Feb 25. The Mount Vernon event is notable but unlikely to sustain search interest at levels close to Feb 20's 65.

4. **The resolution threshold**: Only requires a decline of more than 3 points. Given the historical magnitude of declines (85-90 points from peak), even a partial continuation of the current trend would easily exceed this threshold.

5. **Potential counterarguments**: A major news event involving George Washington could reverse the trend. The 250th anniversary of independence (2026) adds some elevated baseline interest. But these factors are unlikely to overcome the post-holiday normalization.

Outside view calibration:

The base rate from generic 5-day windows shows 35% decrease, but this doesn't account for the specific post-holiday context. The contextual evidence is overwhelming:

- Every historical year shows dramatic decline from Presidents Day to Feb 25
- The current value (65) is still well above the typical baseline (~10-15), meaning there's significant room to fall
- The decline from Feb 20 to Feb 25 needs only exceed 3 points to resolve "Decreases" — a very low bar given historical patterns
- The Feb 22 birthday could create a temporary uptick but Feb 25 would still likely be lower than Feb 20

The probability of "Decreases" is very high — I estimate around 85%. The probability of "Doesn't change" is low (~8%) since the threshold is only 3 points but the historical trajectory suggests much larger moves. The probability of "Increases" is low (~7%) — this would require a major news event or the Feb 22 birthday celebration to drive sustained interest above Feb 20's level of 65 through Feb 25.

Outside View Prediction:
Option_A (Increases): 7
Option_B (Doesn't change): 8
Option_C (Decreases): 85
