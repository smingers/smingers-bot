Analysis:

1) Resolution criteria (paraphrase)
Between 2026-02-20 and 2026-02-25 (UTC) on the fixed Google Trends window (US; 2026-01-26–2026-02-25), compare the daily values: **“Doesn’t change” if within ±3; “Increases” if >+3; “Decreases” if <-3**.

2) (a) Source analysis (summary, quality, date)

- WashingtonBirthday.com schedule (Alexandria, VA) (primary-ish event listing; Feb 2026 schedule page): Lists GW birthday-related events on Feb 20–21. Likely accurate for event timing; effect on national Google searches uncertain.

- Fraunces Tavern Museum / SRNY GW Birthday Ball page (primary source; event promo; for Feb 20, 2026): Reliable for existence/date of the NYC event; limited expected impact on nationwide “george washington” searches.

- George Washington Masonic National Memorial Association gala page (primary source; says sold out; Feb 2026): Reliable that the gala/symposium exist and may be high-interest locally; unclear national search impact.

- TIME article on Presidents’ Day facts (mainstream; Feb 14, 2026): Reliable for holiday timing/context; suggests media attention peaked around Feb 14–16 (already past), implying post-holiday decay.

- NBC Washington “what’s open/closed” (mainstream local; Feb 15, 2026): Reliable but mostly logistical; suggests a typical holiday coverage cycle already concluded before Feb 20.

- Pascack Press (local NJ) event listing for Feb 22 (local news; Feb 17, 2026): Likely accurate for the event; again local footprint.

AskNews items (mixed relevance):
- Newswise GWU law expert on potential SCOTUS tariff ruling (Feb 20): Mentions “George Washington University”; likely irrelevant to searches for “george washington” (topic/entity mismatch).

- AP “Trending SummaryBrief” includes story about slavery exhibit involving enslaved people of George Washington restored by court order (dated Feb 19 summary; restoration by Feb 20): This is plausibly relevant—could prompt some incremental searching about George Washington/slavery, but appears as one item among many in a digest; uncertain magnitude.

- Other AskNews items (Bitcoin searches, Snopes “George Will” deepfake, Kremlin “Washington” meaning US government, etc.): Mostly irrelevant to the query term “george washington” (noise / different “Washington” entity / different “George”).

Outside-view material referenced in the prompt:
- The outside view cites an “agent report” with 5 years of historical GT patterns showing post–Presidents’ Day decline. I can’t directly audit it here, but it’s the most decision-relevant “methodological” input described (historical pattern + steep decay).

3) (b) Evidence analysis using the weighing system

Strong evidence
- **Structural seasonality / historical pattern:** Interest in “george washington” reliably peaks around Presidents’ Day and then drops sharply by late February (as described in outside view). This is exactly the kind of stable, repeating pattern that usually dominates 5-day GT movements.

Moderate evidence
- **Observed momentum/trajectory into Feb 20 (outside view):** Values already fell from the holiday peak (100 on Feb 16) down to ~65 by Feb 20. Short-term momentum often persists absent a new national driver.
- **Resolution threshold is tiny (±3):** Even modest continued normalization makes “Decreases” easy to clear.

Weak evidence
- **Localized celebration events Feb 20–22 (Alexandria gala/symposium; NYC ball; NJ reenactment):** Real events but geographically limited; likely to create small, short-lived bumps, not sustained nationwide interest through Feb 25.
- **AP item about restored slavery exhibit involving Washington:** Could cause some incremental searching, but presented as a brief/trending digest item; uncertain it would overcome the post-holiday decay by Feb 25.

4) (c) Timeframe analysis
- Time until outcome is known: **5 days** (Feb 20 → Feb 25).
- If the window were halved (≈2–3 days, to Feb 22–23): I’d assign a slightly higher chance of “Doesn’t change” or even “Increases,” because Washington’s actual birthday (Feb 22) plus weekend events could create a temporary bump.
- If the window were doubled (≈10 days): “Decreases” would become even more likely, since post-holiday reversion typically continues.

5) (d) Justification: inside-view adjustment from outside view

Outside view base rates (given): Increases 7 / Doesn’t change 8 / Decreases 85.

Inside-view updates:
- Status quo if nothing changes: the post–Presidents’ Day decay continues; by Feb 25 the level is typically much closer to baseline than to Feb 20’s still-elevated value. This pushes toward **Decreases**.
- Countervailing factors (events Feb 20–22; AP slavery-exhibit story) plausibly create **a bump around Feb 20–22**, but the resolution compares **Feb 20 vs Feb 25**—and Feb 25 is after these events. Even if there’s a bump mid-window, it doesn’t help “Increases” unless it keeps Feb 25 elevated above Feb 20.
- Given the low ±3 threshold, the only realistic way to avoid “Decreases” is for Feb 25 to land within ~3 points of Feb 20 (or exceed it). That would require an unusually flat late-Feb tail this year or a major new national news hook tied directly to “George Washington” close to Feb 25. I don’t see strong evidence of that.

Net: I shift modestly further toward “Decreases” vs the outside view, but not to extreme certainty because GT can be noisy and because Feb 22 (actual birthday) sometimes produces secondary attention.

Probability calibration

- Decreases: Most likely. Continued normalization from 65 on Feb 20 to a lower value by Feb 25 is the default seasonal pattern; threshold (-3) is easy to clear.
- Doesn’t change: Possible if Feb 20 is already near the late-Feb floor for the fixed window, or if there’s an unexpected late-window news driver keeping interest steady.
- Increases: Requires Feb 25 to be >3 above Feb 20; would likely need a major Washington-related national story breaking closer to Feb 25, not just weekend commemorations.

Checklist:
1) Options/criteria aligned: compare Feb 25 vs Feb 20 on fixed-date GT; ±3 = “Doesn’t change,” else up/down.
2) Outside view base rates: [7, 8, 85].
3) Consistency: Most likely = Decreases; least likely = Increases; consistent with post-holiday decay logic.
4) Key evidence (most significant):
   - Strong historical post–Presidents’ Day decline pattern.
   - Pre-window momentum: sharp drop already underway by Feb 20.
   - Tiny ±3 threshold makes a further drop very likely to qualify.
   - Feb 20–22 events mostly local and earlier than Feb 25 endpoint.
5) Blind spot: A major national controversy/viral story explicitly about George Washington breaking on/near Feb 25 could lift searches and reverse the decline (would raise “Increases” and “Doesn’t change”).
6) Status quo: gradual reversion to baseline after holiday → Decreases.
7) Technicalities: probabilities 0–100, sum to 100, no % sign.

Probabilities: [5, 7, 88]
