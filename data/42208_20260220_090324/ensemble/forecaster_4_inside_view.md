Analysis
------------------------------------------------------------------
(a) Source analysis (quality, date, factual vs opinion – abridged to the most relevant ten)

1. Google Trends page (live, Feb-20-2026).  
   • Primary quantitative source; machine generated; high reliability for “interest” values.  
   • Facts only.

2. Agent 5-year retrospective table (2021-25) on the same Jan-26 → Feb-25 window.  
   • Derived from Google Trends; methods plausible but not fully audited here – moderate reliability.  
   • Historical facts.

3. TIME magazine “10 facts about Presidents’ Day” (Feb-14-2026).  
   • Reputable outlet; date just before the holiday; factual explanation of the holiday’s timing.  
   • Minimal opinion.

4. NBC4 Washington “What’s open/closed” (Feb-15-2026).  
   • Local TV affiliate; factual logistics around the federal holiday.  
   • No opinion of consequence.

5. Alexandria VA Birthday-Parade / Gala schedule (Jan–Feb 2026).  
   • Official event pages & ALXnow local coverage; primary sources.  
   • Facts about Feb-20/21/22 events.

6. Mount Vernon “Washington’s 294th Birthday” page (Feb-22-2026).  
   • Primary event listing; high credibility.  
   • Facts only.

7. Fraunces Tavern “Birthday Ball” (Feb-20-2026, NYC).  
   • Primary source.  
   • Facts only.

8. AskNews sweep of >20 contemporary articles.  
   • Only one item (“SCOTUS tariff case”) contains “George Washington” (GWU law professor) but refers to the *university*, not the person. Weak link.  
   • Mostly factual short briefs; irrelevant to query term.

9. SerpApi documentation.  
   • Explains resolution mechanics; no bearing on search demand.  
   • Facts.

10. National Archives blog (2016) on Washington’s Birthday history.  
   • Authoritative archival source; old but historically correct.  
   • Background facts.

(b) Evidence weighting

Strong evidence  
• Historical pattern: Presidents Day peak (100) followed by rapid decay to low-teens by Feb-24/25 in each of the past five years (independent, repeatable, structural).  
• Current measurement: 2026 already shows 100 (Feb-16) → 65 (Feb-20) – decay under way.

Moderate evidence  
• Feb-22 “actual birthday” events can cause a small secondary bump; historically this bump is *smaller* (agent table shows +10-15 points for one day).  
• 2026 is the 250th-anniversary cycle; may keep interest slightly higher than typical.

Weak evidence  
• News items using “George Washington” as a *place name* (university, bridge, etc.) – rarely affect the national query.  
• Day-to-day Trends rescaling noise (±2-3 pts).

(c) Timeframe analysis

• Horizon: exactly five days (Feb-20 → Feb-25).  
• Halving (2-3 days): probability of “Doesn’t change” would rise; not enough time for further decay.  
• Doubling (~10 days): “Decreases” probability would rise even more as post-holiday attention keeps fading.

(d) Justification & inside-view adjustment

Base-rate (holiday reference class) 3/9/88.  
Adjustments:

+ 6 pts to “Doesn’t change” (now 15) recognising (i) measurement noise, (ii) 250th-anniversary promotional cycle, (iii) Feb-22 birthday bump that could leave Feb-25 close to Feb-20.

+ 3 pts to “Increases” (now 6) for the unlikely but imaginable scenario that the Feb-22 spike is *very* strong *and* persists through Feb-25, or a viral TikTok/TV special hits.

− 9 pts from “Decreases” (now 79) to keep total 100.

Status-quo continuation (steady fade) still dominates; threshold (>3 points) is low, so any further decline of ~5-10 is sufficient for “Decreases”.

------------------------------------------------------------------
Probability calibration
Most likely: Decreases (continued post-holiday slide).  
Least likely: Increases (would require an atypically durable late spike).

A ±10 percentage-point swing mainly trades between “Decreases” and “Doesn’t change”; “Increases” remains a distant tail.

Checklist

1. Options paraphrase: Compare US-wide daily Google Trends value for “george washington” on 20 Feb vs 25 Feb 2026. >+3 → Increases; between −3 and +3 → No change; <−3 → Decreases.  
2. Outside view: 3/9/88.  
3. Consistency: Most likely = Decreases; least likely = Increases ✔️  
4. Key evidence (short):  
   a) Five-year post-holiday decay pattern.  
   b) Current value already down 35 pts from peak.  
   c) Feb-22 events create only minor, brief upticks historically.  
   d) 250th-anniversary could cushion but not reverse trend.  
5. Blind-spot: Viral documentary/TV special on Washington drops Feb-22 and remains buzzworthy through Feb-25, lifting value >Feb-20. (Would shift “Increases” to ~30).  
6. Status quo: slow fade → supports “Decreases”.  
7. Technicalities: sums to 100, integers, no %.
