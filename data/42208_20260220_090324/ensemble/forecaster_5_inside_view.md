------------------------ ANALYSIS ------------------------

1. Paraphrase of resolution criteria  
Compare the daily Google Trends value for “george washington” in the US on 20 Feb 2026 versus 25 Feb 2026.  
• If 25 Feb > 20 Feb by > 3 points → “Increases”.  
• If within ±3 points → “Doesn’t change”.  
• If 25 Feb < 20 Feb by > 3 points → “Decreases”.

2. Source analysis (quality & factual content)  
a. Washington-birthday.com, GWMNMA, Fraunces Tavern Museum – official organisers; factual schedules for 20-22 Feb events (high quality, dated Jan-Feb 2026).  
b. TIME, NBC4 (14-15 Feb 2026) – mainstream journalism; establish that Presidents’ Day (16 Feb) produces the annual nationwide attention spike.  
c. Five-year Google Trends pull (2021-25) – primary data; shows consistent post-holiday drop 20 → 25 Feb each year (strong quantitative evidence).  
d. AskNews article set – mostly unrelated to George Washington; only tangential mentions (weak relevance).  
e. “Current value 100 on 16 Feb” supplied in question – authoritative for latest level.

3. Evidence weighting  
Strong evidence  
• Historical pattern: 5/5 prior years show > 10-point drop from 20 Feb to 25 Feb.  
• Presidents’ Day always the yearly peak; decay begins immediately afterwards.  
Moderate evidence  
• 2026 America-250 activities may leave interest slightly more elevated for a few extra days.  
• Local birthday events on 22 Feb could slow the decline.  
Weak evidence  
• Chance of an unforeseen viral story (e.g., political meme, Supreme Court ruling citing G.W.) causing a rebound; historically rare.

4. Timeframe analysis  
Window length = 5 days. Halving (≈2.5 days) would raise “Doesn’t change” a bit because decay sometimes needs 3-4 days; doubling (10 days) would raise “Decrease” as the post-holiday slide would have more time.

5. Justification / inside-view adjustment  
Base rate (outside view): 10 / 15 / 75 for Increase / No-change / Decrease.  
Adjustments:  
+ 3 pp to “Doesn’t change” for semiquincentennial & clustered 20-22 Feb events potentially dampening the fall.  
- 3 pp from “Decrease” accordingly.  
No clear case to alter “Increase”; leave at 10 %.  
Re-normalise to 100 %.

Final inside-view: 10 / 18 / 72.

------------------------ CHECKLIST ------------------------
Most likely = Decreases (72 %); Least likely = Increases (10 %).  Consistent with evidence.  

Key evidence (short):  
1. 5/5 prior years show > 10-point fall 20 → 25 Feb.  
2. Presidents’ Day peak already passed on 16 Feb (value 100).  
3. 22 Feb events smaller scale than nationwide holiday.  
4. Semiquincentennial year may cushion but not reverse trend.  

Blind-spot: viral controversy or political speech on 24-25 Feb heavily citing Washington, lifting searches > 20 Feb; would shift probability toward “Increase”.  

Status-quo outcome is decline; bias check therefore favours keeping “Decrease” the modal option.  

All probabilities 0-100, sum to 100.

Probabilities: [10, 18, 72]
