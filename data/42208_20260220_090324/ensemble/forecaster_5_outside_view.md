Analysis:

a) Source analysis  
• National Archives (2004) – purely historical background on the federal holiday; factual, not time-sensitive; no search-data.  
• AP News (Feb-2025) – history & retail angle on Presidents Day; reliable mainstream outlet; establishes the holiday as the main annual attention spike.  
• Economic Times (Feb-2026) – explainer published on the 2026 Presidents Day (16 Feb); shows media interest is front-loaded before our 20-25 Feb window.  
• Alexandria parade article (12 Feb 2026) & Mount Vernon schedule (22 Feb 2026) – local-event notices; factual; indicate some Washington-specific activity around 22 Feb but on a far smaller national scale than Presidents Day.  
• Florida Governor press release (Feb 2026) – state-level publicity that culminated 12-16 Feb; already past at the window start.  
• Agent report – Five-year scrape of Google Trends daily indices (2021-25). Gives numeric evidence that:  
 ▪ Presidents Day = annual peak (100)  
 ▪ 20 Feb value is still elevated but invariably falls steeply by 25 Feb (drop ≥ ~15 points, always > 3). Source uses primary Trends pulls; highest quality for our purpose.  
• Automated 90-day dataset (to 20 Feb 2026) – authoritative, machine-read; shows current index 65 on 20 Feb after the 100 peak on the 16th; gives general base frequencies for 5-day moves (22 % no-change, 43 % up, 35 % down) independent of the holiday context.

b) Reference-class analysis  
Candidates:  
1. All 5-day windows in generic search-interest data (gives 22/43/35 % split).  
2. The five most recent “20 Feb → 25 Feb” windows (2021-25).  
3. Any post-holiday five-day windows for other U.S. one-day commemorative peaks (e.g., “martin luther king”).  

Class #2 is the nearest behavioural analogue—same dates, same term, same holiday trigger, and we have five independent observations (n = 5, 2021-25). Hence adopt class #2.

Empirical frequencies in class #2: 5 Decreases, 0 Doesn’t-change, 0 Increases → 100 % Decreases. Small sample, but pattern is exceptionally consistent.

c) Timeframe analysis  
Window length: exactly 5 days (t = 0 on 20 Feb, resolution on 25 Feb). Historically, search interest falls sharply for 3-4 days after Presidents Day and stabilises around the pre-holiday baseline by 24-25 Feb. No past year shows a rebound after the birthday on 22 Feb that is still visible on the 25th.

d) Justification  
• Status quo trajectory as of 20 Feb 2026: index already slid from 100 (16 Feb) to 65. The derivative is negative (65 → 79 → 81 → 95 → 100 reversed).  
• Known stimuli between 20-25 Feb:  
 – Washington’s 294th birthday on 22 Feb (Mount Vernon event, small national media hit).  
 – Ongoing America-250 publicity (but most big launches saved for July-4).  
Past data tell us that neither the birthday nor scattered local events meaningfully offset the post-holiday decay.  
• Upset risk: a viral controversy, a blockbuster film/TV release, or political debate invoking Washington could create a fresh spike. Over the past 20 years such unscheduled surges have been rare; none happened in 2021-25. Assign roughly a 10 % tail risk that some new story lifts 25 Feb above 20 Feb.  
• Flat (“±3”) outcome requires an unusually shallow slope. Given 2021-25 magnitudes (drops of 10-30 points in the 20-25 Feb span), the chance of the fall being ≤ 3 seems low but not negligible (~15 %).

Outside view calibration:

Start with empirical 100 % Decrease from the reference class. Discount for (i) small sample, (ii) 2026 being the semiquincentennial year which could raise baseline interest a bit, and (iii) general ~5-10 % historical upset frequency in Google-Trends binary questions. Redistribute 25 points of probability mass away from “Decrease” to cover those risks, split 15 % for “Doesn’t change,” 10 % for “Increases.” Final probabilities rounded to whole percentages sum to 100.

Outside View Prediction:
['Increases', "Doesn't change", 'Decreases']  
Increases: 10 %  
Doesn't change: 15 %  
Decreases: 75 %
