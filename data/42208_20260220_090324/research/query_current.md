Analysis:
The key driver of search interest in “george washington” during 20–25 Feb 2026 is likely the first U.S. president’s actual birthday on 22 Feb. Presidents Day (16 Feb 2026) has already produced a spike (value 100). Interest may decay after the holiday but could rebound if there are widely covered commemorations, museum events, school activities, TV specials, or Semiquincentennial (USA 250) programming tied to Washington’s birthday. Current news about planned celebrations, exhibitions at Mount Vernon or the National Archives, government proclamations, or new documentaries/books releasing that week will inform whether public attention will stay elevated or drop. Therefore, searches should focus on events or media scheduled for 20-25 Feb 2026 that mention “George Washington”.
