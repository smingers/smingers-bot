Analysis:
The key outside-view question is whether Google searches for “george washington” normally rise, fall, or stay flat in the five days after 20 February.  In the United States, two closely-timed calendar catalysts drive most of the term’s annual search volatility:
1. Presidents Day (third Monday in February – 16 Feb 2026, four days ago), which usually produces the peak search day of the year.
2. George Washington’s actual birthday (22 Feb), which often adds a smaller secondary bump but is typically lower than the Presidents Day spike.

In prior years, Google Trends shows a sharp surge on the holiday Monday followed by a quick drop beginning Tuesday.  By 23–25 Feb the index is usually well below the holiday peak.  Therefore, to ground a forecast we want:
• Historical Google Trends charts or commentary showing the post-holiday decay pattern.  
• News or event coverage that might keep Washington in the headlines after the holiday (e.g., bicentennial commemorations, newly announced monuments, school curricula, or unexpected political references).  
• Any 2026-specific plans for 22 Feb celebrations that could sustain interest.
