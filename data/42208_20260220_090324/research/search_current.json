The city of Philadelphia, led by Mayor Cherelle Parker, confirmed the exhibit\u2019s restoration was underway. In space news, NASA conducted a second critical fueling test for the Artemis II moon rocket at Kennedy Space Center, pumping over 700,000 gallons of fuel after previous leaks due to faulty seals and a clogged filter; the test\u2019s success will determine if the Artemis II mission can launch in March 2026. At a tech summit in New Delhi, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s attempt to foster unity by having AI leaders Sam Altman and Dario Amodei hold hands on stage backfired when they instead raised their fists, drawing viral attention to their companies\u2019 rivalry.

This triggered a Crypto Fear & Greed Index reading of 5, marking 'Extreme Fear,' the lowest level since the 2022 market crisis. Search volume peaked at a Google Trends score of 100 during the week of February 1, reflecting widespread retail anxiety and fears of a 'death spiral.' The sell-off was fueled by institutional de-leveraging, a failed retest of the $70,000 psychological resistance level, and a 100% tariff announcement by former President Donald Trump on Chinese imports, which unsettled global risk-on markets. While some analysts, like Bloomberg\u2019s Mike McGlone, warn of a crypto bubble collapse with a potential target of $10,000, others highlight bipartisan market structure legislation as a stabilizing force. A Matrix on Target report provides a framework for identifying Bitcoin\u2019s cycle low and optimal entry points, referencing prior accurate forecasts such as the 2022 bull run signal, the $125,000 peak prediction for mid-2023, and the bearish trend confirmation after Bitcoin fell below key levels in late 2025.

Watch out**\nA fabricated YouTube video circulated in February 2026 claiming that Fox News cut away from U.S. President Donald Trump mid-speech during a Cabinet meeting in February 2026 because he appeared to be 'falling apart.' The video, titled '1 Minute Ago: Trump Falls Apart Staff Handling Him Legacy Panic & Black History Erasure |George Will,' falsely attributed commentary to conservative columnist George Will, using deepfake technology to manipulate his audio and visual appearance. The video, produced by the YouTube channel 'Politics Raw,' included a disclaimer stating that the content was digitally generated, but this was buried in the expanded description and likely overlooked by viewers. No credible news outlets reported such an incident, and there is no verified broadcast footage supporting the claim. Analysis shows the video reused authentic footage of Will from real interviews, digitally altering his mouth movements and voice to match a fabricated script. The background, lighting, and camera angle in the fake video closely resemble Will\u2019s real appearances on C-SPAN, NewsNation, and The Washington Post. The channel, created in mid-January 2026, published multiple nearly identical videos with sensational titles like 'BREAKING' and '1 Minute Ago,' using AI-generated thumbnails mimicking Fox News branding. The video\u2019s narrative included false claims about Trump\u2019s mental decline, the Gateway Project funding controversy, the Kennedy Center renaming, and systemic erasure of Black history. Snopes rated the claim as fake, citing lack of evidence, synthetic audio, unnatural lip movements, and the channel\u2019s pattern of clickbait content. No record exists of Will making these statements in his Washington Post columns, on social media, or in recent TV appearances.

Bush emphasized Washington\u2019s humility, reverence for history and superior knowledge, self-restraint in power, and willingness to step down after two terms\u2014choices that prevented America from becoming a monarchy. Bush noted that Washington\u2019s decisions to relinquish power twice set a lasting standard for presidential conduct. The message carried implicit weight given Trump\u2019s repeated challenges to election results, his 2020 election denial, and his public interest in running for a third term despite legal constraints. Bush underscored Washington\u2019s role in shaping both the character of the presidency and the nation, stating he \u2018embodied integrity\u2019 and \u2018put the good of the nation over self-interest.\u2019\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: February 17, 2026 01:38 AM\nSource:[yalibnan.com](https://yalibnan.com/2026/02/17/george-w-bush-torches-trump-in-presidents-day-message/)\n\n**Washington's Birthday: U.S. Stock and Bond Markets Closed for One Day on February 16**\nThe United States observed Washington's Birthday, also known as Presidents' Day, on Monday, February 16, 2026, resulting in a one-day closure of U.S. stock and bond markets.

This move follows a series of controversial actions, including cutting nearly a quarter of the National Park Service workforce, proposing a $1 billion budget reduction that could eliminate about 350 park units, and downplaying climate change. The Interior Department, under Secretary Doug Burgum, will also designate June 14\u2014the president\u2019s birthday\u2014as a free entrance day, while removing Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s birthday from the list of free days. Critics argue that no individual politician should be featured on park passes, and the decision is seen as emblematic of a broader disregard for the National Park Service. The annual pass can be purchased before December 31, 2025, to remain valid through December 31, 2026.\nOriginal language: en\nPublish date: November 30, 2025 08:35 AM\nSource:[nationalparkstraveler.org](https://www.nationalparkstraveler.org/2025/11/travelers-view-ridiculous-move)\n\n**White House Unveils New \"Walk of Fame\" with Surprise for Biden**\nOn September 24, 2025, Semana.com reported that the White House inaugurated a new \"Walk of Fame\" in the hallway of columns leading to the Oval Office, featuring black\u2011and\u2011white portraits of U.S. presidents from George Washington to the current president. The gallery, visible from the Rosaleda, was expected to be a symbol of American sovereignty and history. However, the portrait slot for former President Joe Biden was filled with an \"autopen\"\u2014a device that automatically signs documents\u2014rather than a photograph. The article notes that Trump appeared \"perplejo\" by the detail and had previously warned that the Walk would be \"pol\u00e9mica\". Trump also ordered an investigation in June into the use of the autopen for signing executive orders and other documents during Biden\u2019s presidency, claiming it was used to mask Biden\u2019s alleged cognitive decline. Biden, 82, responded, \"Seamos claros: tom\u00e9 las decisiones durante mi Presidencia. Tom\u00e9 las decisiones sobre los indultos, las \u00f3rdenes ejecutivas, la legislaci\u00f3n y las proclamaciones. Cualquier insinuaci\u00f3n de que no lo hice es rid\u00edcula y falsa.\" The autopen portrait will be visible to guests attending a dinner at the Garden of Roses on Wednesday, a venue Trump has renovated as part of broader White House updates. Trump has also moved Barack Obama\u2019s portrait from its original location and has hung several of his own portraits, continuing a trend of significant decor changes.\nOriginal language: es\nPublish date: September 24, 2025 09:11 PM\nSource:[Semana.com   \u00daltimas Noticias de Colombia y el Mundo](https://www.semana.com/mundo/articulo/la-casa-blanca-estrena-su-particular-paseo-de-la-fama-con-una-sorpresa-en-el-espacio-de-biden/202557/)\n\n\n--- Deep Research Analysis ---\nError running deep research: ForbiddenError: 403012 - Usage limit exceeded for 'chat_tokens', please upgrade your plan at https://my.asknews.app/plans to increase your limits.\n</Asknews_articles>\n"
