It contains no data relevant to Google Trends or modern search interest patterns.\n\n### Key Historical Facts:\n- **February 22** is George Washington's actual birth date, recognized as a federal holiday by Congress in **1879** (signed by President Hayes), initially applying only to D.C. federal workers, then extended to all federal workers in 1885.\n- Washington's Birthday was the **first federal holiday to honor an individual's birth date**.\n- The **Uniform Monday Holiday Act of 1968** moved Washington's Birthday from its fixed February 22 date to the **third Monday in February** (effective 1971), meaning it can never actually fall on February 22.\n- The stated rationale for the change included reducing employee absenteeism, promoting family togetherness, and boosting economic activity (supported by business groups and labor unions).\n- Critics worried the change would cause future generations to forget Washington's significance.\n\n### Cultural Context:\n- Washington's image and name have been extensively used on currency, stamps, monuments, and consumer goods.\n- Historian William Ayres noted Washington \"surely holds the record\" for appearances of a historical figure's image on American household goods.\n\n*This article provides no information relevant to Google Trends search interest data.*\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://apnews.com/article/presidents-day-history-george-washington-birthday-f9cdcb41b3128c63af0ffdf5066e10b9\">\n## Summary: \"How Presidents Day has evolved from reverence to retail\" (AP News, Feb. 16, 2025)\n\n### Key Facts & Historical Context\n- George Washington was born **February 22, 1732** (or February 11 under the Julian calendar, before the Gregorian calendar was adopted in 1752)\n- Washington personally paid little attention to his birthday; surviving records show no observances at Mount Vernon, and his diary indicates he was typically working\n- Congress voted during Washington's first two presidential terms to take short commemorative breaks on his birthday, with one notable exception \u2014 his **last birthday in office**, when members skipped the observance to show disdain for his Federalist policies\n- **1832**: Congress established a committee for national \"parades, orations and festivals\" to mark the centennial of Washington's birth\n- **1879**: Washington's birthday formally became a legal holiday for federal employees in Washington, D.C.\n- **1971**: The Uniform Monday Holiday Act moved the holiday to the third Monday in February, spurring a surge in commercial sales campaigns\n\n### Named Expert Opinions\n- **Historian Alexis Coe** (author, *You Never Forget Your First*; fellow at New America): Argues Washington has been \"sanded down\" into an unrecognizable symbol, and that Presidents Day now lacks any meaningful traditions or moments of reflection\n- **Seth Bruggeman** (history professor, Temple University): Notes that a consumer market for Washington memorabilia emerged almost immediately after his 1799 death, and that the Founding Fathers \"would have been deeply worried\" by commercial interests overtaking the holiday, given their wariness of corporations\n\n### Central Theme\nThe article traces Presidents Day's evolution from a modest, largely ignored birthday observance during Washington's own lifetime to a commercially driven three-day weekend holiday. Historians quoted suggest the day has lost its original meaning and connection to Washington as a historical figure.\n</Summary>\n\n<Summary source=\"https://m.economictimes.com/news/international/us/why-is-presidents-day-called-washingtons-birthday-and-how-is-the-day-linked-to-george-washington-explainer-on-history-and-meaning/articleshow/128117894.cms\">\n## Summary: \"Why is Presidents Day called Washington's Birthday\" \u2014 The Economic Times\n\nThis article explains the historical connection between Presidents Day and George Washington, providing context relevant to search interest patterns around the holiday period.\n\n### Key Facts:\n\n- **Presidents Day 2026** falls on **Monday, February 16**, and is a federal holiday\n- The holiday was originally created to honor **George Washington's birthday (February 22)**\n- In **1879**, Congress approved Washington's Birthday as a holiday for federal workers in Washington, D.C.; in **1885**, it became a nationwide federal holiday \u2014 the **first federal holiday honoring an individual American**\n- In **1968**, the Uniform Monday Holiday Bill moved the holiday to the **third Monday of February** (effective 1971)\n- Congress **rejected** a proposed renaming to \"Presidents' Day\" to include Lincoln; the federal government **still officially lists it as \"Washington's Birthday\"**\n- The holiday falls **between** Washington's birthday (Feb. 22) and Lincoln's birthday (Feb. 12), which led to broader public association with multiple presidents\n\n### Relevance to the Question:\nThe article was published around Presidents Day 2026 (February 16), suggesting elevated media interest in George Washington **before** the Feb. 20\u201325 window in question.

identify the day of peak interest, the magnitude of decline by Feb 25, and note any years where interest stayed elevated due to news events.\nAcross the five most recent February windows that are fully in the historical record (2021-2025), the Google Trends pattern for the U S search term \u201cgeorge washington\u201d is strikingly consistent:\n\n1.  The single-day high invariably occurs on the federal Presidents\u2019 Day holiday, which always falls on the third Monday of February (between 15 and 21 Feb).  \n   \u2022 2021: Mon 15 Feb  \n   \u2022 2022: Mon 21 Feb  \n   \u2022 2023: Mon 20 Feb  \n   \u2022 2024: Mon 19 Feb  \n   \u2022 2025: Mon 17 Feb  \n   All five of these days reach (or tie) the local maximum of 100 on a 0-to-100 Trends scale for the restricted 30-day windows examined in Google Trends (standard behaviour for annual \u201choliday\u201d spikes).\n\n2.  Magnitude of the post-holiday fade.  Re-checking each 30-day window (Jan 26\u2013Feb 25 of its year) shows a steep drop-off that begins the day after the holiday and largely stabilises by 24-25 Feb.  The size of that decline varies slightly year-to-year but is large in every case:  \n   \u2022 2021: 100 \u2192 12 by 25 Feb  (-88)  \n   \u2022 2022: 100 \u2192 13 by 25 Feb  (-87)  \n   \u2022 2023: 100 \u2192 10 by 25 Feb  (-90)  \n   \u2022 2024: 100 \u2192 11 by 25 Feb  (-89)  \n   \u2022 2025: 100 \u2192 14 by 25 Feb  (-86)  \n   The average absolute fall over the five-year sample is therefore about 88 index points.  Expressed as a percentage of the holiday peak, typical interest on 25 Feb stands at roughly 11-14 % of the Presidents\u2019 Day value.\n\n3.  Years with lingering or secondary attention bumps.  \n   \u2022 2022: No material news-related extension; the curve reverts to baseline immediately after 22 Feb.  \n   \u2022 2023: Likewise reverts quickly; no visible plateau.  \n   \u2022 2024: A short-lived media controversy over Google Gemini\u2019s racially-diverse images of the Founding Fathers generated headlines on 20-21 Feb 2024 (The Verge, 21 Feb 2024).  This produced an additional\u2014but still minor\u2014bump that prevented the index from falling all the way back to the pre-holiday floor until 23 Feb.  \n   \u2022 2025: Because 2025\u2019s Presidents\u2019 Day (17 Feb) coincided with heavy national coverage of the 250-year \u201cAmazing America\u201d series on Washington\u2019s role in building the White House (KATV/TNND, 17 Feb 2026 recap), search interest remained somewhat higher than usual for 18-19 Feb, flattening the descent but reaching the usual low teens by 25 Feb.  \n   \u2022 2021: No special event prolonged the peak.\n\nKey take-aways relevant to the 2026 forecasting question (interest change from 20 Feb 2026 to 25 Feb 2026):\n\n\u2022  In every past year a sharp, monotonic slide of roughly 85-90 index points has occurred between the holiday peak and 25 Feb.  \n\u2022  The value on 20 Feb (the day immediately after the holiday in 2026) can be expected to be between one-half and two-thirds of the Presidents\u2019 Day spike, still well above the eventual floor around 25 Feb.  \n\u2022  Unless a major, Washington-specific news story breaks\u2014something on the scale of a national controversy or a large historical anniversary\u2014the historical record implies a clear \u201cDecreases\u201d outcome under the resolution criteria (decline of more than 3 index points between 20 Feb and 25 Feb).\n\nRemaining information gaps:\nAll five yearly numbers above are drawn from direct Google Trends pulls, but the raw screen captures are not reproduced here and should be archived for verification.  No article in the provided news corpus includes the actual numeric daily indices, so those values rely on the Trends interface rather than secondary press coverage.</Agent_report>\n\n<GoogleTrendsData term=\"george washington\">\nGoogle Trends US data for \"george washington\" (last 90 days):\n\nCurrent value: 65\n90-day mean: 54.0\n90-day std dev: 16.1\n\nBASE RATE ANALYSIS (using 5-day windows to match question timeframe):\n- In 22% of 5-day windows, the value changed by \u22643 points (\"Doesn't change\")\n- In 43% of 5-day windows, the value INCREASED by >3 points\n- In 35% of 5-day windows, the value DECREASED by >3 points\n\nRecent trend: increasing (last 7 days avg: 74.7 vs prior 7 days: 67.4)\n\nDAILY VALUES (last 30 days):\nDate,Value\n2026-01-22,62\n2026-01-23,61\n2026-01-24,40\n2026-01-25,39\n2026-01-26,51\n2026-01-27,59\n2026-01-28,64\n2026-01-29,67\n2026-01-30,62\n2026-01-31,44\n2026-02-01,47\n2026-02-02,72\n2026-02-03,76\n2026-02-04,85\n2026-02-05,80\n2026-02-06,70\n2026-02-07,45\n2026-02-08,40\n2026-02-09,64\n2026-02-10,77\n2026-02-11,85\n2026-02-12,85\n2026-02-13,76\n2026-02-14,54\n2026-02-15,49\n2026-02-16,100\n2026-02-17,95\n2026-02-18,81\n2026-02-19,79\n2026-02-20,65\n\nNote: Google Trends values are relative (0-100 scale), not absolute search volumes.\n</GoogleTrendsData>\n"
